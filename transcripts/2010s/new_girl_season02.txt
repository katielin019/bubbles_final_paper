{START OF EPISODE 1}
Oh, late, late, late, late, late.
I couldn't dance with another No, I Couldn't ask for another Groove is in the heart, yeah.
Cold, cold, cold shower!
Hey, hey, hey.
You can't turn the sink on when someone's in the shower.
This is not some fancy hotel.
Okay, I'm sorry, I overslept.
I'm running late for a meeting with the vice principal.
Please get out of here so I can save a little bit of my dignity.
One, two, three, four.
Groove is in the heart.
I'm not gonna do it, Schmidt, so you can just stop asking me.
- Well, I'm gonna keep asking, so just do it.
- Look, I'm not doing it until you tell me why you've had time to shave your chest but not your face.
Ugh, Jess, would you please scratch an itch I have on my undercarriage?
I can't get the right angle and Winston refuses.
No, I don't have time, Schmidt.
Jess, please, I-I-- this is awful.
I feel like I dropped something in there.
You hear that?
Loose change.
I thought we talked about you not wearing your shower diaper in the kitchen.
Excuse me, do you think this has been easy for me-- to wash myself all summer long with a penis cast on?
Thank God this thing comes off this afternoon.
And by the way, I know what you've been thinking, and the answer is yes, I have been able to reach completion with some very precise and vigorous nipple play.
Nipple play-- off-limits.
Wait, Jess, please, I-I'm begging you.
Okay, fine.
Just get it, just get it in there - in the back.
- Stop moving like that.
There you go.
Oh, thank God.
What am I watching here?
- What do you mean?
- This is friendship, Pure unadulterated friendship.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- It's Jess.
Hi, Tanya, um, sorry I'm late.
Take a seat.
Okay.
Is everything all right?
I'll give you the bad news first.
Okay.
The bad news is, is that cutbacks are forcing me to lay off ten percent of our nontenured teachers.
That's terrible.
But the bad news is, is that it seems you are one of them.
That's not how you deliver news.
What are you doing?
Trying to make this more fun.
- No.
- You're right.
Tanya, I'm a really good teacher.
I care about my kids.
I spent two months in summer school with an Indian student named Vaj Rejuv and I did not laugh once, not once.
I'm sorry, Jess, but on the plus side you can have anything you want out of the lost-and-found box.
Okay.
- Good choice.
- Thank you for the opportunity.
Um, it's been an honor working here.
The dictionary defines "teacher" as Okay, you can take another one.
No, you can't share a bowl of cereal.
Why not?
The cast is off, gentlemen.
- Great.
Congratulations, man.
- Good news, man.
Oh!
- Oh!
Yeah, take it in.
- Goodness, the smell, man.
- We have done nothing but love you, Schmidt.
Soak it all in, in all its foul glory.
That is not just some disgusting, salty bundle of gauze.
That is a symbol of who I was for the past two months: The broken-penis guy.
But if there's anything that majoring in marketing with a minor in theater studies has taught me, it's that everybody has a brand.
Nick, your brand is gypsy alcoholic handyman.
Winston, your brand is Winston.
Nicholas, Winstoniel, I'm staging an event to relaunch the Schmidt brand.
It's going to happen this Saturday night, and it is going to be epic.
You're having a party to tell girls you're ready to have sex again?
Not a party; A rebranding event.
Please tell me there's not a theme.
There most certainly is a theme-- it is a secret - that will be announced on the night.
- I bet it's danger.
No, you're you're wrong.
It's not danger.
- It'll be announced on the night.
- I really think - It's going to be danger.
- I'm going to go with danger.
Come on, man, it's not danger.
Stop guessing danger.
Who'd you invite?
The ladies from Lululemon, my urologist, my badminton partner, my financial planner, Philip Seymour Hoffman and a guy who once wrote for a little show called Crank Yankers.
And obviously Cece.
She hasn't spoken to you all summer-- since you broke up with her.
Yeah, I'm over it.
It's not about her.
I hope she comes.
Now, let's talk venue.
Jess, oh, my God.
Are you okay?
How long have you been sitting here?
I panicked, and I grabbed the hat.
I should have grabbed the yo-yo or the slap bracelet, and now all I have is this stupid hat.
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.
I'm overthinking it.
The hat's fine.
You take me home?
Yeah, of course.
I-I can't go upstairs, though, 'cause of the whole Schmidt thing.
It's going to be okay, all right?
I mean, this is the moment before something amazing is going to happen for you.
I promise.
Put these on.
Is this making you feel better?
I've decided to host my - relaunch event at Nick's bar.
- No.
And you, my friend, are bartending.
Don't make me work for you.
You can have everything else.
Come on, man.
You're perfect.
You bring the heat, but you're not a threat in the looks department.
- I get that, actually.
- And only you Can make those fruity drinks that used to make the girls lose their minds in college.
Fine, I'll do it, but I'm not making those drinks.
Oh, come on, Nick.
You have a gift.
Why you always trying to hide your light under a bushel?
Because, sure, I could get a girl topless, no bra, with one hollowed-out papaya, some crushed ice and two fingers of rum, but then I grew up.
Now I only want to make a drink that a coal miner would want.
Straightforward, honest.
Something that says, "I work in a hole".
And I'm especially not making those drinks for you.
- What?
Why?
- 'Cause you can't handle it.
You drink them way too fast, and then you get weird.
Oh, come on.
That was, like, years ago, dude.
I'm a changed man.
I mean, look at me.
- I'm wearing a suit.
- A suit?
Please.
That's something they put on Morgan Freeman when they let him out of Shawshank.
Look at that.
What, did a magician die in that thing?
Hi.
I got laid off.
- What?
Are you serious?
- Oh, my God.
- What happened?
- Obama.
It's possible I'm still in shock.
I'm going to go to my room and process what just happened.
Thank you for your attention.
Ah, this is not good.
Now she's going to cry.
I hate it when she cries.
Her face gets all red and puffy.
- Makes me sick.
- Okay, we got to Fix this right now, guys.
Let's go.
We got to do something.
- Okay.
Here's how this is going to go.
- Hi.
You will not pity me.
No pity eyes.
Schmidt, stop looking at me like I'm a fat kid riding a bike.
It's just a job.
I'll get a new one.
You're going to get so many jobs, Jess.
I promise.
So I just want you to go about your day and act normal.
Okay?
What's wrong with your eyes, Nick?
Stop blinking.
Why are you doing that?
I just think they fired the wrong girl, kid.
Oh, for sure.
Stop.
Nick!
What's up?
- What's wrong with you?
- You wiggin'?
- Act normal, okay?
- If that's what you want.
- That is what I want.
- That's what you'll get.
Where you going, Schmidt?
Sorry.
This way.
Bye.
Hey, hey.
Hey.
- How you doing, kid?
- Great.
My boobs are loving this unemployed thing.
They don't have to go to boob jail every day.
Job hunt is on.
This hospital Web site says I can earn up to $700, and all I have to do is be infected with dengue fever.
Are you sure you're okay?
For the thousandth time, yes.
I know you've been waiting all week for me to break down, but I'm fine.
Just be normal.
- I'm being normal.
- You're crossing your legs.
I always do this.
You've never crossed your legs in your entire life.
I didn't even know you were that flexible.
- Well - And stop being nice to me.
What, I'm not normally nice to you, Jess?
No.
You're mean, like a crazy old man.
"I'm Nick.
I hate sunshine.
"When did gum get so fancy?
This escalator goes too fast".
Be mean.
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.
Sorry.
That that was in my head a little.
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.
- No.
Tighten up!
- That's terrible.
I don't have it today.
I don't know what it is.
Can you believe that the zoo wouldn't let me borrow their white tiger?
I mean, the nerve.
I'm going to be sitting in the back of the party, and Philip Seymour Hoffman's going to be like, "Look at that idiot who couldn't even get a big cat".
Schmidt, you need a tiger.
I need a job.
Hire me.
- No.
- Here - No, I'm not going to - Schmidt!
- What are you?
- Hire me.
I am a people person.
I'm great at parties.
I can make any kind of balloon animal, as long as it's a worm or a snake - No, Jess.
- Come on.
Help a brother out.
Jess, you just got laid off, okay?
I can't have an emotionally vulnerable person on my crew.
Tonight is about one man's functioning penis.
I wouldn't say functioning.
I saw what you did to the toilet seat.
And I'm not unstable.
I just need a job.
Okay, fine.
You know what, Jess?
Fine.
You can be my other shot girl.
- Yes!
- A shot girl?
No, you can't be a shot girl.
Why not?
Because you don't have that specific hotness that shames men into spending nine dollars on a two-dollar shot.
- She doesn't have it.
- Are you saying I'm not hot?
No, no, no, I'm not No, no, you're hot, you're hot.
- Nick!
- I'm saying you're the nurse That I want to wake up to after having my stomach pumped.
You know what I mean?
Its a different kind of hot-- still hot.
I'm going to be a great shot girl, Nick.
I pour liquids into cups every single day.
Add on top of that two years of light tap and jazz.
Please, I feel I feel you overthinking this already.
I'm going to be the best shot girl in the world.
- Cheers!
- Cheers.
Getting my costume.
Hiya, big boy.
What's your poison?
- Oh - What?
Yeah, interesting choices.
It's a great hat.
Can I have it?
Let's get rid of that.
I've decided that tonight my name is Ivy, and I'm studying to be an actress, and I'll sleep with you if you give me a part - in a Paramount picture.
- Do you have another Outfit in your car, or are you going to stick with this one?
Hey, young man, why weren't you drafted?
- You like someone?
- Good stuff.
Schmidt!
Just the guy I was looking for.
- So the theme of the party is - Is danger.
That's right, but it's on a level that you - couldn't possibly understand, Nick.
- Okay.
Just, where where is the other shot girl?
- I don't know, boss.
- Here I am.
Casey.
Thank you for joining us.
Great.
Here's where it's at.
I don't work with amateurs.
I don't split tips.
Things get a little freaky in here, I'm out the door because I'm a little diabetic and I don't need a hassle.
And also, I do accept payment in the form of whippets because I've got a PhD; - a Pretty Heavy Drug Problem.
- Oh.
How old are you?
Twenty-six.
Thank you for your honesty.
Yeah!
Who's up?
Okay, you jerk, come here.
Stupid jerk.
Who wants a shot of firewater?
Anybody want me to wet their whistle?
Hey, Schmidt.
It's working, Nick.
Look at all these beautiful ladies.
And this is just the beginning, man.
I can take this to the next level whenever I want.
You know why?
'Cause I got something up my sleeve.
Schmidt, please, nothing up your sleeve.
It never works!
Remain in your seat and finish the exam, Mr. Schmidt.
You know, in Student Health Services, they still call that "Schmidting the bed".
Why are you proud of that?
What the hell is this?
Come on, Schmidt, you know I don't - make girly drinks any more.
- I didn't buy that stuff.
You didn't buy this?
Then who did?
What's my name?
Casey!
You're all a bunch of jerks.
Yes!
My penis is working!
Casey!
Hey.
- Hey.
Hey-hey!
Cece.
I had to check out the new and improved Schmidt.
Been hearing so much about it, so I'm really glad that you came.
Look, I wanted to tell you I want you to meet Robby, my, uh, my boyfriend.
Your what?
There he is.
The one shaped like a Liberty Bell?
It's a great party.
Thank you for inviting us.
- Flip it, man, flip it!
- I'm flipping it!
Did you guys see Cece's new boyfriend, the commoner?
Oh, wow, Schmidty, you really lowered Cece's bar.
There's got to be an explanation for this, like he's the Lord of Winterfell or he's working with a real piece of pipe.
Schmidt?
Schmidt, don't get hung up on that guy.
And here comes the weirdness.
Not weird, just a guy who really wants a drink.
Mm-mmm!
Mmm Mmm!
It's like an explosion of fruit!
There it is.
Look at me being so naughty!
So naughty.
- Hey.
- I'm Schmidt.
I, too, was a sexual partner of Cece.
- Welcome to the party.
- Thank you for having me.
Let me just tell you this is a very impressive party.
There's speakers everywhere.
There's one over there.
I saw two on the back wall.
Oh, there's one right there.
Didn't see that one before.
- Yeah, there's a lot of speakers.
Lot of - Lots of speakers.
Yeah.
So, so what's your deal?
I mean, do you vacation in Europe ever?
No.
You know, I've never left - California in my life.
- You in a band?
I don't, I don't like music.
What's up with me, you know?
- You work for Goldman then?
- For who?
This feels good.
I'm gonna go.
Congratulations on your penis, man.
What's your name?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Could I get a broom?
!
Look at my butt.
Look at my butt, stupid jerks.
Hey, Jess.
Nick, I'm fine.
I don't need you to be nice to me right now.
Okay.
You want me to be mean?
- Yes.
- I'll give you mean, Jess.
This is the easiest job in the whole world!
The only thing easier than this is passing out cigarettes to prisoners.
And what if I wanted to take a body shot off you?
Oh, yeah!
I can't because you're wearing a turn-of-the-century bathing costume.
How's this?
Are you getting mad or are you happy with this?
It's good.
That's really good.
So stop feeling sorry for yourself, kid, and get up on that bar and shake that piece of plywood - that you call an ass!
- That's too far!
- Yeah, yeah, I agree.
You got a great ass.
- That is too far!
That is too far.
This is so fun!
Sexy girl all around the world No hat.
No hat!
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work Sexy girl all around the world Just shake your hips and put that ass to work - Sexy girl all around the world - Yeah!
Just shake your hips and put that ass to work Sexy girl all around the world Just shake your hips and put that ass to work You know, this Robby guy's got nothing on me.
- Right.
- I think I can get Cece back.
Seriously, just let it go.
I just need to remind her how amazing I am.
Luckily, I've got something up my sleeve.
Schmidt, no, no!
Schmidt, don't!
Schmidt, no sleeves, please!
Shot girl, shot girl!
Shot girl, shot girl, shot girl, shot girl!
Shot girl, shot girl, shot girl, shot girl!
Shot girl!
Shot girl!
Shot girl!
I'm a shot girl.
Oh.
I'm a shot girl.
Hey, J-Jess, Jess.
Jess, where are you going?
What am I doing, Nick?
I'm a teacher.
I'm not a shot girl.
Fire the most dangerous element of all of the elements.
Now I'm doing this.
Okay, let's see here.
And then now I'm doing this.
Sure.
And now I'm not sure what I'm doing.
I'm not actually quite sure how to stop this.
Um, this is definitely real fire.
I'm very apologetic.
I think everyone should leave.
Um, thank you very much for coming.
There's party favors at the door.
I'd like to thank my urologist for coming.
Oh, wait.
No, no, no, everybody, look.
I'm okay.
I got it under control.
Cece, watch this one.
Hey, look, Cece.
Fire!
Where's Robby?
Pulling the car around.
You really scared him.
Why haven't you called me back in two months, Cece?
You are the one who broke up with me.
I don't see you until you show up here tonight with with a boyfriend?
And please, please tell me he's on some sort of medication that's making him temporarily bloated.
Come on, okay?
You and I both know we never would have worked.
We are far too alike.
Both so beautiful.
You're gonna be fine.
You know that, right?
Hey, uh, Cece, I I got to know, why him?
I mean, what, what is his brand?
He's just a good guy.
And I'm too dangerous?
Yeah, that's it.
I'll see you around, Schmidt.
Yeah.
Fun fact: There's a reason why guys nickname me "T-Ball".
When they step up to the plate, they never strike out.
Honey, what happened to you in your life that made you like this?
I graduated from MIT, and then I got into a horrible accident where I lost half my brain.
There it is.
I came back to say good-bye.
I figured that.
I was kidding myself.
I love teaching.
It's who I am.
What if I can't do anything else?
Jess, come on.
I can't do anything, and look at me.
I'm kind of fine, you know?
It's just that being a teacher was all I ever, ever wanted to do.
It just, it just sucks, you know?
Yeah, life sucks!
And then it gets better, and then it sucks again.
Yeah.
And then, and then it just - Sucks.
- sucks.
Nick.
What?
Will you be mean to me one more time?
Look sharp, you dumb-ass!
You look sharp!
You're a terrible shot girl!
You got hoof hands and a plywood ass, kid!
You call that a shot girl outfit, you dumb-ass?
I got mixed up-- I thought it was a cigarette girl.
That is what happened.
You look like a cigarette girl.
The chills that you spill out my back keep me fill With satisfaction when we're done Satisfaction of what's to come I wouldn't dance for another I wouldn't dance for another!
Groove is in the house.
Danger!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Well, it took a year, she's finally cooking and cleaning.
I knew this would pay off eventually.
Does everybody like egg pie?
Jess, I believe the word that you're looking for is "frittata".
Oh, Schmidt, stop staring at my fritta-tas!
You gotta do something, Nick.
My sister's coming, my mother's coming.
I love being unemployed.
I love it!
If I'd lost my job a week ago, - I'd be deep in a porn hole by now.
- Five-second rule.
The images, the things I would have seen by now.
It's Jess, are you cooking a frittata in a saucepan?
What is this, prison?
- Jar.
- Jar.
That's a jar for sure.
Yeah, I know.
I already got the money ready.
No!
- What?
Oh, no!
- Damn it!
No!
Jess!
What is this?
!
I just finished that last night.
Isn't it great?
Felt art?
- Nick?
- I'm on it.
What?
What photograph were you working from?
My hair hasn't looked like that in three weeks.
Your hair looks just like that, Schmidt.
Yeah, your hair looks just like that.
You are perfect in that.
This is making me furious.
It's multi-cloth collage.
Insane!
Jess, can I have a word with you?
Take a break!
You're looking at this the wrong way.
This is the first time you don't have to be anywhere or do anything.
Right.
You could make weird art or don't make weird art.
But the point is you can do whatever you want.
You could go off the grid.
You could be an outlaw.
I'm not really someone who goes off the grid, Nick.
Whoo-hoo!
I'm off the grid!
I'm so far off the grid, that everybody's all, "She's off the grid"!
And then I'm all, "I don't play by your rules".
I can drink at 11:00 a.m. Yeah, that backfired pretty quickly.
High five.
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- It's Jess.
Look at that, look at that, look at that.
My mom always said I was a late bloomer.
Wait till she sees this mustache!
Bam!
- That's not a shadow?
- What?
'Cause your nose makes a shadow right over your Oh, now it is a mustache.
You look adorable.
Winston, I need you to be honest with me, okay?
- Yeah.
- Does your mother not like me?
Yes.
She does, she does not like me?
Schmidt, she loves you.
Good, good, because, you know, historically speaking, I'm like, catnip to tough-talking African-American women.
It's 'cause I don't front, know what I mean?
Don't do that.
A'ight.
What is that?
What's your name?
I'm Nick.
Nick's name is Nick!
- Nick, meet Nick.
- Hi, Nick.
You guys even look alike.
Look at that turtle face.
Nick, want these kegs behind the bar?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- He was talking to me.
- He was talking to you.
Andy, I'll go get your check, bud.
Oh, hey, Winston, you know, you can just have the hummus in there, okay?
It's giving me the toots.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, Alisha.
You look great.
Wow.
Thanks.
It's like they stretched the ugly out of Winston.
Hmm.
How's the hoops?
- Good, it's good.
- Yeah?
Very impressive, pro ball.
I mean, women's pro, but still.
Swoosh.
I was working in real estate, but I got laid off, so I got laid off last week!
I don't even know what to do with myself.
I just told myself it was a chance to start over.
- Yes.
- Be someone That I've always wanted - to be, you know?
- I'm Jess.
Hi.
How are ya?
I'm Bearclaw!
Bearclaw helps me with the deliveries.
Hey.
- Here's your check, my man.
- Thanks, man.
Maybe I'll see you around.
I'm in the phone booth.
Um, oh, it was nice to meet you, Jess.
- Nice meeting you, too.
- And, Jess, you met me.
Nice to meet you both.
Hey, Nick, I know what I'm gonna do with all my free time.
- Him.
- You like him?
Mother, may I?
Can you give him my phone number?
Yeah, absolutely.
Winston, your sister got so hot.
I'm gonna have to Shaq attack her.
- Schmidt.
- May I have your blessing?
'Cause I'm gonna be, - Like, dribbling up the court.
- Schmidt.
Boom.
Technical foul.
Boom.
Illegal use of the hands.
Boom.
- Hello, Schmidt.
- Charmaine.
Charmaine!
The loft just became Big Mama's House!
- Give me a hug.
- You gonna take care of this?
- He's dead to me.
- Okay.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Are you Katie?
I'm Sam from Cupid Match.
And I'm the girl from my dreams of you.
You are Katie, right?
- Yeah.
- Finally.
I am.
I'm Katie.
Hi.
Hi.
So many e-mails back and forth.
How's the little dog of yours?
I had to put her-im down on the way here.
- Oh, my God!
- I know.
Can I tell you something?
Uh, not really.
I'm you from the future.
Well, that's a first.
Nick, I traveled from the future to find you.
I'm a time traveler.
Does everybody tip badly in the future, or is it just you?
You don't believe I'm you, do you?
Absolutely not.
Well, I know you didn't shower this morning.
Well, good guess.
It's a Wednesday.
I know a girl broke your heart and you gave up on love.
I know sometimes you get mad and you don't know why.
I know you're a bartender because you like three feet of bar between you and everyone you meet.
Well, I mean Chew on that, you clown.
Wait.
Hey, don't-don't say all that weird stuff and then just leave!
You were wrong about the bar!
But everything else was right.
What was the band that we?
I know I'm in.
I've been to Forty-two.
- No way!
- Way!
- Are you serious?
- Wow!
Way to go, Cupid Match.
Yeah.
Hey, hold still.
You got a little hair on your nose.
Let's just say, hypothetically, we live in a world where time travel exists, okay?
So if that is the case One, Marie Antoinette.
Two, Cleopatra.
Three, young Ann-Margret.
Four, old Ann-Margret.
Would you shut up, you clown?
!
I'm being serious!
I'm talking about real time travel here, Schmidty.
And I made an astute observation off of that.
I might have met future me.
Who knows about this?
Nobody.
You're the first person I've told, obviously.
- Whoa.
- If I find out how you die, Do you want me to tell you?
Don't worry.
I already know.
It's one of these moles.
- See this little S.O.B. right there?
- That's the guy?
I've been eyeing him for a while.
That's one's gonna turn green one day, and then there you go.
Schmidt's dead.
I met me in my bar!
Ask him when I meet Kanye.
'Cause I vision I'm talking about real time travel.
I have visions of me, Kanye, BeyoncÃ© I could figure out what happened!
- Hey, can I talk to you guys?
- What's up, baby?
Don't call me baby.
Seriously, stop.
Come on, spill.
- Don't wink at me.
What?
Okay, look, I had the best sex of my life last night.
He brewed me like a fine chamomile.
Oh, so that was you.
I thought that was a couple bums fighting.
It wasn't..
It was me having sex.
- Mm.
- I left my body, went up to heaven, saw my grandparents, Thought it was weird that I saw my grandparents, came back down, I became a werewolf, I scared some teenagers.
I came back into my body.
Only thing is, he thinks my name is Katie.
And that I'm a dancer and/or something involving puppets.
Katie?
Hey, Sam.
- These are my roommates.
- Hey.
- Hey, uh, Katie, we're running late for dance rehearsal.
- Yes.
Oh.
We're wondering if we're doing leg warmers today - Leg warmers.
- Oh, we are.
Leg warmers?
You guys are dancers, too?
- Yeah, I mean, mostly Katie, - Yes, yes.
- But yeah.
- What, do we not look like dancers?
- No, I mean - This one's a leaper.
- No, I knew he was gonna go there.
- You're a leaper.
You are.
Yep.
He is.
They call him, uh, Cricket.
- Yeah, Cricket the leaper.
- Let me see you leap.
- Cricket, show him how you leap.
- I'd love to see you leap.
Don't get self-conscious now.
You've got this.
- You've got it.
- You're really getting a show here, 'cause he normally doesn't do this for a private audience.
- Do the tribal stuff.
- All right.
Yeah.
- Beautiful.
- Is he okay?
I'm kind of hearing some popping.
No, no, Look at that vert.
- Breathtaking.
- Faster.
Faster.
Grasshopper.
And I'm done.
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna go to a couple brunches, maybe take a nap, rehydrate.
Come here.
This is so normal.
This isn't upsetting at all.
Yah!
Oh, man.
All right, I'm gonna text you later.
- Yep.
- And if you find my underwear just, uh keep it.
I got to go.
Wow, Katie's an animal.
- Katie's the best.
- Nice.
I love being Katie.
- Vintage Katie.
- Like an animal you are.
Katie knows how the sausage gets made.
- Ew.
- Katie Has a job, y'all.
I think I should just stay Katie.
Maybe you should watch a cautionary tale that I like to call The Nutty Professor.
What's Katie gonna do, Nick?
She's got some pretty dark needs.
Well, I hope you don't like him, 'cause you're not coming back from, "Just kidding.
My name is actually Jess".
"Hey, I got your number from Nick.
Want to hang"?
- What's this?
- I gave your number To the guy that you like from the bar.
You asked me to.
Oh, my God.
I forgot.
I've never had two guys into me before.
- What's happening?
- Jess, I'm gonna tell you what's happening.
Okay, there comes a time in every person's life when for no reason whatsoever they are irresistible to the opposite sex.
For me, it was the third night of Hanukkah '96, which I like to refer to as The Night of the Shoshannas.
For me, it's every time I Jet Ski.
This is not fair.
It is gonna take all of my game - to sleep with Winston's sister.
- What?
- What?
- And then there's you, Who has this raw animal magnetism just dropped in her lap like a sack of taters.
What a waste.
- I'm pretty sure it is not a waste.
- Oh, it's a waste.
Jess, look, you don't have the skill to juggle men.
You wear a cardigan on top of another cardigan.
We all know you're not the best with doorknobs.
You can barely hold one thing in each hand.
You tripped the other day just standing there.
What's happening?
Okay, but Katie can juggle men.
She's out the door before you even know your wallet's gone, son.
Ooh.
He wants to cook for me.
Is there a hot way of saying I don't feel sexy after I've had a lot of cheese?
I would say no.
Didn't know this was a butter knife type of place.
Don't worry, the team's paying.
If anybody asks, you're the ball boy.
Hey, Coach, put me in.
- Schmidt.
- Schmidt, what the hell are you doing here?
Come on, move over.
Hey, y'all.
Everybody scooch, a little scoochie down.
- Okay, teamwork.
Defense.
- Really?
A lot of money that I want to deposit into your Tyra Banks.
If he touches your sister, I'm gonna stop paying your cell phone bill.
The L.A. Sparks.
So many Sparks in one place, you're about to start the world's sexiest fire.
Am I right?
Andy and I have been sending each other some pretty dirty texts.
Come to the professor.
Let me see.
He says, "Can't stop thinking" about what you're gonna wear tonight".
How do I respond?
- With a simple - Mm-hmm.
"Or not wear".
- Okay.
- Okay?
"Or not wear because sex happens naked".
Send.
Okay, let me help you with that.
"Just kidding.
Get ready for a night you will never forget".
Okay?
"Because once you see my body, you will go brain-dead and have memory loss".
Send.
Oh, no.
Autocorrect changed "body" to "meat bar".
Bearclaw, what are you Yeah!
Oh, you're so hot.
Come here.
I can't wait to see your meat bar.
That's why they call me Bearclaw.
You did that yourself in middle school.
See now it's retracting its claws.
Now it's contracting its claws.
Like, "Rrr, I'm gonna attack you in the wild".
Oh, my God, phone's ringing.
- Oh.
- Got to take this.
I'm so sorry, it - No, no, no, I - It's very important.
I'll just be cooking.
I love cooking.
It's my only outlet.
Nick, Nick.
You gave my number to the wrong guy.
- Wait, which one did you want me to give your number to?
- Andy.
Andy is so boring.
Bearclaw just told me a ten minute joke about squirrels with the punch line, "eat these nuts".
Seriously, he is so awesome.
Nick, I don't want to hurt his feelings.
Tell me what to do because you got me into this mess; this is your fault.
This is not my fault.
I just wanted you to stop cleaning the kitchen so much, Jess.
Oh, my God.
Who's Katie?
I'm Katie.
What is happening?
- Hey, mama bear.
- Hey.
Yeah.
Can I tell you some thing?
Me first.
Um, when Nick When Nick told me that you wanted my number, I was all like And then I was like, Nick, this might be the best thing that ever happened to me.
Now you go.
Um what I was gonna say was, um You're an old soul.
Hey, I wanted I wanted to tell you.
When I, uh, I got your text from before, and I have figured out my sex character.
And it's Sergeant Giddyap Carruthers.
Hey, if we if we make love later, and I tell you to pretend that I'm a scary ghost, are you gonna be weirded out by that?
Bearclaw, I'm sick.
Oh.
- In my face.
- Oh, no, um, I've got an anal thermometer in my bag.
I'm really good at telling myself, and I think that I'm I feel very feverish.
- I don't think I need the thermometer.
- Oh, yeah.
No, you do feel hot.
Yeah.
Now you feel even hotter.
Alisha, have a drink with me.
Schmidt, I only go out with guys who play basketball.
Well, let's play for it.
I win, you have a drink with me.
You win, I take you to brunch.
Shoot me.
Schmidt, I'm a professional basketball player.
Yeah, and I'm a guy who works in marketing that wants to give it to you.
We both have jobs; Get over it.
Do I ever finish writing my zombie book?
Z is for Zombie?
Great title.
Do we ever get rich and famous?
Three words: Hot, air, balloon.
Do we invent them?
No, they've been invented.
Jess or Katie?
Not now, Nicks.
Hey, tell her you're sorry.
- What for?
- You'll find out.
I mean, I'm sure I did something stupid, but what did I do?
You just tell her you're sorry.
What did I do?
You did something stupid.
So tell her you're sorry.
Now I know why people get annoyed with me.
It's hard to talk to us.
Hey, you know, I can't believe she asked Nick for your number and then Yeah, yeah, you know what, man?
We-We're perfect together.
It's like I finally found my lady bear.
See, I felt like we had a connection, too.
You know, I don't know if you ever get that feeling like, I don't know, like maybe I could marry this woman.
Oh, God.
Is there a woman in that bathroom being harmed?
No.
I don't buy it.
Get out of the way.
I was trained for this.
Now you're gonna get the Bearcl Jess?
Hi, Bearclaw.
I thought you were sick.
I'm feeling better.
Why are you if you're sick, why are nothing but your breasts covered, Jess?
Are you a doctor, is that why?
Are you a doc is he a doctor?
- Do you know these guys, Katie?
- Who's Katie?
What is going on in Jess?
- No, Nick.
- I Katie?
What is happening?
!
Liar!
You Liar!
I'm sorry, Bearclaw, but I meant Nick to give my number to Andy.
Silver lining, you have a huge fan in Nick.
She's not good enough for you, Bearclaw.
None of these people are good enough for you.
And, Sam, I'm sorry I stole you from real Katie, but ugh, look at you.
- He's so handsome.
- Very handsome.
I'm only human.
You know what, Bearclaw?
I would have take you to the bathroom, - big guy.
- He would've.
You guys are terrible people.
- I want to die.
- Hey, hold on a second.
Everyone just calm down.
Are you really a dancer?
- Are you an idiot, Sam?
- Yes!
Did I tell a lie?
I did.
But in my defense, I'm off the grid.
We're all off the grid.
Hey, hey, we are all off the grid.
Every single one of us, especially you, handsome.
- I loved you!
- I think that's a little bit of an exaggeration.
You're gonna tell him how he feels after everything - you've just done?
- Why don't you shut up, Andy?
- Yeah, shut up, Andy.
- What is this, recess?
Come on.
Shut up.
- Shut up.
Shut up, Andy!
Nick.
It's time.
Good-bye.
No, no, Nick.
Old Nick, don't go!
Nick!
Nick, wait.
Please.
There's so much more I need to ask you.
I got to get back.
Why do I need to apologize to Jess?
What did I do wrong?
Make her an old-fashioned.
Beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep.
Beep, boop, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Beep, beep, boop, beep, ba, ba, ba, beep.
Beep, beep, boop, boop, boo.
I believed you.
Olde England.
Have a good trip, man.
- When I was a kid, - Yeah.
Watching MTV, I thought that if I played my cards right, I could grow up to be Jenny McCarthy.
Jenny McCarthy?
You?
Don't make that face.
She was so beautiful with all that swearing, but you know what?
I'm not Jenny McCarthy.
I know that now.
- I'm back on the grid, Nick.
- You know, I always wanted to be Kurt Loder.
Kurt Loder?
He never even went to the Spring Break House.
He was stuck in New York, talking to Pearl Jam.
He is the elder statesman of our generation.
Why are you making me a drink?
You never bring work home.
All right, this is gonna sound really weird, but in the future I might do something really bad to you, and I hope you'll forgive me.
Do you like old-fashioneds, Jess?
I've actually always wanted to try one.
How did you know?
What are you gonna do to me?
I don't know.
But it could be bad.
Like me getting drunk and peeing in your closet on all your pretty dresses.
I forgive you.
Imagine all that pee on your pretty dresses, Jess.
I still forgive you.
Hey.
Sam, hi.
Katie?
Not Katie.
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry to come over here unannounced.
I didn't I just wanted to tell you that I don't I don't care that you lied to me.
I lied, too.
Half my profile is a lie.
I am not a shy food blogger who wants a destination wedding in Scotland, okay?
I don't open up the more you get to know me.
I mean, I, you know, Internet date so I don't have to sleep with people I work with.
I do like Creed, though.
I hate Creed.
I don't care what you like or what your name is, or anything about you.
And the good news is you don't have to care about me either.
And we can still tear each other apart.
What do you think?
You know what?
I'm gonna say yes, I think.
Yeah, let's do this.
Um Do we start now or later or now?
Congratulations.
I see you've met the one.
Watch out for the wall.
Yeah, that's right, this cut Goes out to all y'all that's been Missing us for mad years, one love, yo Yeah, that's right, he's got game PE, 1998.
It might feel good It might sound a little something But damn the game if it don't mean nothing You ready, ma?
'Cause I'm about to dribble this hard all the way to the hole.
Come on, Schmidty.
All right, let's do this.
Come on, ma.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey.
You're a big girl.
You can watch The Walking Dead alone.
Sam booty-called me.
Ooh, Sam, he's so hot.
- I don't care.
Good night.
- Don't!
- What?
- I need your help.
I don't know what to do.
I'm terrible at casual sex.
I left him in there with crayons and paper, like he's a kid in a restaurant, and I told him I had to check - my fantasy football.
- You don't even know what that is.
No, sir, I do not know what that is.
I panicked.
Help me.
Look, you can't separate your feelings from sex?
So what?
You're a girl.
I deserve to have a shorty on the side.
Okay, a shorty is not that's the wrong use of "shorty".
- Hey, I drew a cat.
- Uh, sorry, man.
She's, uh, checking her fantasy football 'cause she Yeah, I'm not gonna do this, so I-I don't even - Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Are we gonna talk about it?
Talk about what, Winston?
The belt, Schmidt.
Please explain the belt.
It's after Labor Day.
I'm wearing whales.
- The dumbest thing ever.
- You look like the bad guy in an '80s high school movie.
I'll have you guys know that Kanye wore this belt, okay?
- Kanye.
- Kanye?
Yeah, and he looked beautiful in it.
His whole midsection lit up.
What is your obsession with Kanye?
Befriending Kanye is the most efficient way for me to jump social strata.
Now all I have to do is meet him, and then dazzle him to the point that we're each other's last call before bed.
"Yo, what up, K?
"Yeah, I'm just going to sleep.
"You watching Fallon?
- "That brother's crazy".
Hey, Tagg Romney.
You know if your dad's gonna win the election?
He does look like a Romney.
Telling me that I look like one of the most handsome men in politics does not hurt my feelings, Winston.
Last night was horrible.
Sam came over, we tried to make out, I stopped it, and then we just laid there like two old couple in The Notebook waiting to die.
Jess, I get it-- you're the type of person that you need to ease into these kind of things.
- Let us take you out tonight, okay?
- Uh-uh.
And that way, you you can feel like, you know, you're going on a date first.
Yes!
Like we're all dating in a large, nonsexual friend group.
My nightmare.
Have fun.
I'm out.
Come on, Nick.
Please?
Why are you doing this, Jess?
Why don't you just date a guy that-- I don't know-- you like?
This is good for me.
I always jump into relationships.
Plus, Sam's not the kind of guy you spend Saturdays in your sweatpants with.
He's the kind of guy You bone.
I can't help.
I'm at a crucial point in my zombie novel.
- You selfish bastard.
- I'm not a selfish bastard.
- I just have to I have to get through - You're a selfish bastard.
- I'm so sick of this zombie novel nonsense.
- Not nonsense.
Friends help friends have meaningless sex, okay?
Now, you're going.
- End of story.
- You got it.
Where are you, Schmidt?
This place is fancy, and I don't know which fork to kill myself with.
I got to bail!
Kanye's at this club tonight.
What are you talking about?
This was your idea.
Can't miss this, Nick.
I got the belt on.
I took Winston with me to prove that I can be friends with black people, even oddly shaped ones.
Just shut up, Schmidt!
Shut up!
This is ridiculous.
I'm leaving right now.
Good-bye.
Whoa.
Wow.
I forgot what you look like when you're not dressed like the Loft Troll.
- Pardon?
- Sorry, I didn't What I mean to say is you look va-va-va-vavooms!
Hello, nurse!
Hubba-bubba!
Meow!
Zing!
You can stop me at any time.
- Are the guys coming, or?
- No.
It's just us-- they bailed-- so if you want to go back to the loft, or we can both go back to the loft.
- We're already here.
- But we're already here, so Can I get you a chair, milady?
- So weird.
- Yeah.
Loft Troll not used to fancy gentleman!
- Shut up.
- That was so loud.
Why are you yelling?
On the list.
Winston!
You've been staring at this girl for five minutes.
I hope you're checking her out.
Otherwise, you're a serial killer, which would explain a lot.
No.
Checking her out?
- No, dude, I'm in a relationship.
- I know.
Like, happily.
Shelby, we're Shelby and I haven't had sex in three weeks.
- For real?
- We're in a bit of a rut.
Not now.
I have to go to the bathroom.
- I'm cheating on Shelby.
- What?
- No, no, in my mind.
- In your mind?
- I'm cheating on Shelby in my mind, man.
- So what?
So what?
What do you mean, "So what"?
I'm doing it all the time.
Like, I'm doing it a lot.
I can't control myself, man.
Listen, everybody does it every minute all the time.
How do you think I get through the day, man?
Okay.
Wow.
Um, in that case Hey, lady, can I introduce you to this lady?
- This place is crazy expensive.
- Schmidt picked it.
I can afford the valet charge and the "Add onions".
Then you'll be happy to meet my little Scottish friend.
You unexpected genius.
- Is that whiskey?
- White wine.
White wine?
!
Why would you do wine?
- Nope.
- All right, my man.
- Not gonna happen.
- Schmidt?
It's the belt, man.
- Take off the belt.
- Okay, the only thing I know in this world is this belt is amazing.
Look, if you're gonna wear that thing, just - just make it work for us, okay?
- You got a plan?
Yeah, I got a plan, of course.
All right, go talk to your peeps.
- It's not my peeps.
- It's your peeps, man.
Go talk to them.
- Don't say don't do this.
- Yeah, man, come on.
- I mean, come on.
Really?
- Yeah, word.
We got Tagg Romney out here.
We're gonna need you to sweep the the perimeter.
What the hell you talking about?
Tagg Romney.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Romney.
Like, Mitt Romney's your dad?
Let's get America back to work.
- Here's the thermos.
- Thanks.
You know, the drunker you get, the more obvious you're being with the thermos.
"Thermose"?
"Thermas"?
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
What's a "thermoos"?
That one right there in your hand.
Oh, the "thermase"?
- This is fun.
- This is really fun.
It's Sam.
He's done with work, and he wants to "hang out".
He's got a job, too?
Poke a hole in that condom.
Thank you, Nick.
I now feel ready to have meaningless sex.
- I do what I can, so - Hey, do you need money for the?
Half the soup?
No, I think I got it.
Loft Troll eats fancy soup.
Get out of here, would you?
Go have fun.
Excuse me.
Can I get an ice bucket for this bad boy?
And more than your normal amount 'cause this is a thermos, so Ah I see what we're doing here.
We're stalking your ex-girlfriend.
Oh, is Cece here?
Schmidt.
Cece, what up?
So, where's, uh, Blobby?
Where's where's Blobby?
Where's that dude?
Oh, you mean my boyfriend?
His name's Robby.
Excuse me.
My friend is too embarrassed to come over here, but she said she heard from someone in line that you're a Romney.
- I am - She's right over there.
Oh, yeah, I'm a Romney.
- Hell, yeah, I'm a Romney.
- Oh, come on!
- Security, remove the threat.
Remove the threat.
Code red.
- Is that how bad it is?
- Right this way, ma'am.
Come on!
- Hey, that woman is stupid enough to believe Remove the obstruction, please.
Code red.
Code red.
Winston, I thought you were better than this.
I'm so sorry.
I am a huge supporter.
In '08, I was the national cochair of Kappas for Romney.
You caught me.
I'm a Romney.
I'm trying to be incognito, so just You're Tagg?
- Tugg.
- Tugg?
Tugg Romney, yeah.
I'm Tugg Romney.
Tagg's everywhere.
Too much Tagg for me.
Tugg.
Whoo!
What a night.
What a crazy night.
Yeah, me, too.
I found a dollar on my way out of the restaurant.
I used it to buy a slice of pizza.
One day closer to death!
Winston, what is wrong with you?
No.
Nothing wrong with me, girl.
I'm just brushing my hair.
I just want to say that I had meaningless, wonderful sex last night with Sam.
And that sex would not have been possible without the efforts of a one Nick Miller.
Ugh!
But okay.
I don't want to kiss and tell, but he did ruin my dresser during intercourse.
Come on!
Why are you saying that?
- Will you go to Ikea with me?
- Sure, I'm not doing anything.
But don't let me lay my eyes on the Malm collection.
I can't afford it, and I'm a sucker for it every time.
I'll go get my golf pencils.
Mm-hmm.
If you got something to say, my man, just say it.
Hey, look, a man can only sit back and observe but for so long before he has to speak his mind.
Then speak your mind.
A line has been crossed, all right?
You, my friend, have become her fluffer.
Like in porn?
An emotional fluffer.
I'm an emotional fluffer?
You got to set some boundaries, all right?
You're gonna start fulfilling ever single need of hers, all right?
Doing all the things that a boyfriend would do - Winston - for some other dude who ain't doing nothing.
- And I'm her friend.
- You're her boyfriend.
- No, I'm not her boyfriend.
- You're a boyfriend without the rewards.
How about this?
Why don't you just shut up?
- Hey, Nick, you ready?
- Yeah.
So it's not available at the closest Ikea, but it is available at the second-closest Ikea, which is about if we could drive over the reservoir.
But we can't, so - it's about an hour and a half.
- Cool.
I had so much sex last night.
Fluffer.
- You're gonna get caught.
- Impossible.
I've been studying Romney trivia all day long.
Memorizing Dad's gestures so I can mimic him.
You're calling Mitt Romney "Dad" now?
That's where we're at?
- Mm-hmm.
- Schmidt, we get it.
He's the dad you never had.
Okay, all-knowing Indian god Ganesha, this is about sex.
You know they have Romney Olympics every summer at the lake house?
I bet that's a hoot.
I'm sure it's like the real Olympics, only the white people win the sprints.
- Okay, so you good?
- Okay.
Yeah.
Hey, Nick, any chance you understand how to put this together?
I think it looks pretty easy, actually.
No, you know, I'm actually busy.
I'm, uh I'm moving money around.
I'm-I'm diversifying.
I've got And I'm not your fluffer, by the way.
What's a fluffer?
In pornography, it's the person who keeps the actor motivated, aroused, you know?
Ew!
That's a job?
And that's what I am.
I'm your emotional fluffer.
I'm there whenever you need a guy.
You want a cup of tea, I'll make it.
You lose your phone, I'll call.
You're my friend.
That's what friends do.
I'm you boyfriend without the rewards.
Oh?
Yeah.
You're saying you want the?
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
Not with you.
Blecch!
- Don't say "blecch"!
- I don't want it.
I'm not disgusting.
It's not an unheard of thought.
- Blecch!
- Come on.
Admit it, you've thought about it.
You and me, sexually?
Nope.
Blecch!
Never thought about it once.
- Don't lie.
- Not on purpose.
Sleeping Nick is a totally different guy.
You know you did when you walked in on me doing deep lunges.
Yeah, check my Google history, Jess.
It's filled with girls doing deep lunges.
I mean, I'll admit I've thought about it.
- Yeah.
- When was this?
Last year.
Just once.
Would you like to eat me?
What do you mean?
Aren't you a little small?
What, are you nuts?
!
What happened?
Why am I doing this?
That's what does it for you?
Yeah, I thought about it for five minutes, and then I realized it would never, ever work between us.
Yeah, I agree.
That's how I see it.
- Great.
I'm glad we agree on something.
- Me, too!
- Great.
- Out of curiosity, why do you think that, though?
Because you drive me nuts, Miller!
Because you're always sighing, like you're the president of the United States and you have to decide whether we're going to war or not.
I sigh because you sing about everything.
I do not.
And I hate it.
You sing and dance about nothing.
You're cheap!
- You are so cheap.
- I'm not cheap.
You never, ever put money in any tip jar, ever.
- What are you talking about?
- I've never seen you ever do that.
Last week, when we went to the coffee shop.
- You put nickels in the tip jar!
- You know what - a jar is in my business?
- Nickels!
Nickels are worse - than no money; it's an insult.
- It's just a little boy saying, "Love me"!
- "Give me attention"!
- You're a bartender.
- You live on tips.
You should know better.
- The nickel?
- The only American currency - You can't not give someone a tip - Because you don't like tip jars!
- graced with the face of Thomas Jefferson.
- Well, I think that's rude, Nick!
- I didn't realize you were on the fence - about the Louisiana Purchase - You hate everything!
- Jessica!
- And I could never live with that.
I barely live with it now!
But you need me to have sex.
Oh, that's what you think?
I'm calling Sam, and we're gonna go on a date.
And we're gonna talk our faces off.
- Okay?
- Good luck.
Good luck with that.
- Can't find your phone, Jess?
- No, I'll find it.
- 'Cause I'm not calling you this time.
- Are you happy now?
Now I have to get to know the guy I'm sleeping with.
That was a pocket dial!
That was an ill-timed pocket dial!
I will not explain myself!
I just wish I had a lot more solo Tugg time.
You know?
Well, you can be Tugg with me.
Sometimes I think that I'm just a riddle that, well, even I can't solve.
Yeah, see?
I tried to solve it again.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I hope it's okay, I invited over some of the Kappas For Romney.
- Kappas For Romney!
- Courtney.
- Such a pleasure.
- Courtney.
- I'm April.
- April.
- They just got so excited when I said I met one of the Romney boys.
- Oh, no, who wouldn't be?
- Did you ask him?
I think April's in love with your brothers.
- Who isn't?
- Who's the shy one?
Who's the joker?
Who's tried coffee?
April, you're such a spaz.
Yeah, no, nobody gets rowdy like us Romney boys.
Just a bunch of alphas, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
That is, of course, unless we're fishing on Lake Winnipesauke.
There's nothing that I love more than just getting out on the water with Dad, the freezing cold dawn, a couple of cold beers in hand.
Having that one quick moment Your dad doesn't drink.
He's a Mormon.
Well, we don't drink the beers, Courtney.
You know, we just buy them to support American breweries.
Then we dump them in the lake.
'Cause we're Americans.
So um I want a casual sex affair, just like in the movies.
- Nice.
- But it turns out I need some conversation first.
So - If you want to hang - No.
- Hang out more - I don't - I don't want to hang out more.
- Okay.
Because, if I hang out with you, it's just the truth, I'm gonna fall in love with you.
It's just how I am.
I can't separate things out.
Under what circumstances would you build a dresser for a woman?
And this is, like and I'm not interested in sleeping with her?
Um - Am I being blackmailed?
- No.
Oh, is it like a it's like a Make-A-Wish Foundation type thing?
- No.
- I mean Yeah.
Marriage.
You know, anything besides marriage is a you know, an abuse.
An abuse?
Yeah, you can't do that to a friend.
Unless your friend's a chump.
Or a certified carpenter-- that would work.
Wait a minute.
This isn't a sex thing, is it?
Because I you know, I can't pleasure a woman and build a dresser at the same time, you know?
I'm not God.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on, man?
Are you going to the dark place?
I'm not going to the dark place, okay?
I did what you said, I told her I didn't want to be her fluffer, and it went great.
Then what is wrong with you?
Get up, man.
Look, I did what you said, and I feel terrible.
Because you didn't set boundaries.
I don't know what that means, Winston.
As a friend, you can lift a heavy object, but you can't drive her to the airport, okay?
You can hold the elevator, but only if you see her running down the hallway saying, "Hey, man, please can you hold the elevator"?
No picnics, no mini-muffins and never Adele.
- Adele?
- Never Adele.
- Adele's amazing.
- No Adele.
No concerts, no music, no T-shirts, no nothing.
- But guys and girls - Never Adele!
A little Adele.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Nick!
You're gonna calm down, okay?
You want my help or what, man?
Yes.
Don't be so intense.
Most importantly you will not build her that dresser.
It's furniture.
It implies that one day, you will share it with her.
And that's not gonna happen.
You're right.
You're right.
Are-are you spelling it right?
Two "G"s, silent "B".
Here's a picture of the whole family.
And you are not in it.
Yeah, well, somebody had to take the picture, Megan.
Just admit it.
You're not a Romney.
Oh, I'm not a Romney?
Would a non-Romney know this?
That Ma and Pa never go to bed angry.
That there are 16 grandchildren, Allie, Joe, Thomas, Gracie, Wyatt, Parker, Miles, Jonathan, Sawyer, Nate, Nash, Mia, Owen, Soleil, Nick and Chloe.
Those are just facts you got from the Internet.
I'm proud to be a Romney.
Okay?
I'm proud to have had a dad that was around when I was growing up.
A dad that took me camping, a dad that spent Saturdays with me, throwing throwing the football.
A dad that gave me a wink when I left for prom night and said, "Be safe, son".
When I think of a dad like that, I'm proud not only of the Romney name, but of this country.
God bless Mitt Romney.
God bless America.
It's a candid shot from the governor's biography.
The caption says, "The whole family".
Nitpicking turns me off.
You're all horribly unattractive to me.
Tugg Romney, out.
Hey.
I got your text.
When you're going through a Taylor Swift-like range of emotions, I should come over, right?
You were the only one that I could talk to.
Being brown, you have the wisdom of 1,000 white women.
All right.
What happened with that girl?
Winston.
Winston.
- Hey.
- Hmm?
- Are you serious right now?
- Well, I - He-he said it was okay.
- She is off limits.
Go call your girlfriend.
You obviously have things you need to work out.
Fine.
Fine.
But for the record, it was loving and tender and you squeezed my hand at the end.
Get out of here!
Deviant.
Okay, so tell me what happened.
Well, I'm back to being Schmidt.
I'm gonna miss it, though.
Being a Romney.
Schmidt, your life would not have been better if you were a Romney.
Cece, look, my dad left when I was eight.
Okay?
And then he went and had three kids with his new wife, and me and my mom were just these two weirdos who belonged to nobody.
Until she started spending all this time with this woman from work who who she still lives with today.
Schmidt.
He's your dad.
All right?
Find a way to forgive him for not being a presidential candidate with great hair.
Forget it.
No one understands.
There, I thought you needed that, okay?
- Just take a breath, and it will - Shh.
Shh, shh, shh.
It's like memory foam.
Call your dad.
You've been cheating on me in your mind?
Yes, but, like, to be fair, you were there.
A lot of times, you would just pop up mad, but you were there.
Winston, come on, it's fine.
Look, you can think about whatever you want to think about.
I know I'm the one you want to be with.
Come on, want to come upstairs and watch some SVU?
You want to watch SVU right now?
Well, I'm too wound up to watch Raymond.
Look, sometimes after a big fight, I like to cool off with some TV.
What do you mean, big fight?
- We just had a fight.
- We hardly talked.
Like, I want to talk, I want to fight, I want to do something!
Well, maybe we can fight in your mind.
Hey.
Stop.
- Jess - Stop.
Do not Come on, Nick.
Don't build that dresser, please.
Jess, it's fine.
I have another one.
I need, like, three to build this thing.
I can't let you fluff me.
I can't let you work in emotional porn.
You have too much to offer.
Forget it, Jess.
I'm building you the dresser.
I love this stuff.
It's like high-stakes Legos.
Okay, but I didn't know what I was doing to you.
I've always had relationships in different boxes.
Friends in one box, boyfriends in another.
But now it's messy, and I don't want to screw up what I have with you.
- You're too important to me.
- It's different with us.
We're just two people who want to be friends, but are sometimes attracted to each other.
- Ha!
- No, no You have thought about the reward.
That's not what I said.
My calculations were correct.
I love deep lunges.
Just don't make a big deal of it.
I just don't need a bunch of people telling me what we can and can't do together.
That pisses me off.
If I want to build you a dresser, I'm gonna build you a damn dresser.
But if you want to have dates before sex, just do me a favor and have them with the guy you're having sex with.
- Agreed.
- Good.
Maybe I should just stop trying with Sam.
I'm old-fashioned below the belt.
I've got a Civil War-era piece of equipment, and that's all she wrote.
All right.
I got to give you something now.
Something really close to my heart.
That's Nick's Sexy Mix.
AKA the original fluffer.
"The Humpty Dance" does it for you, Nick?
Do your thing, girl.
Get crazy.
When we're done, I want you to immediately turn this off.
Yes.
Ooh
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, Mr. Belvedere, there's two guys outside with a giant box, and it's got "happy birthday" written all over it.
There it is.
Hey, guys.
Pay up, gentlemen.
She's sitting on the couch.
Yeah, right, you won.
- Let me get a four.
- Mm-hmm.
TGIF marathon tonight.
- What?
- I can't take this any more.
What is happening?
I've actually been working on something.
A rÃ©sumÃ©, maybe?
Did I do that?
I'm sorry.
Did you just say you were working on that?
- It's Urkel!
- Urkel?
Urkel.
Urkel, Jess?
- It's funny.
- Okay, look, It is perfectly fine to watch TV all day.
- No, it is not.
- No, it's not.
- But Urkel?
!
- Come on.
Not even in my darkest moments did I do Urkel.
Guys, that's crazy.
This is objectively hilarious.
- I can do any character from an '80s sitcom.
Quiz me.
- No.
Oh, Alf, don't eat the cat!
Get out of the city, Cousin Larry Appleton.
- I'm Frasier Crane.
- No!
Jess, the men in suits here, the professionals, - would like to know what the plan is.
- I'm a professional, too, pal.
You're not.
Please, you work in a bar.
It's a whole different thing.
I respect you.
Just, please.
I don't know what the plan is, Schmidt, but I love working at the Casserole Shanty.
Today I got a locker, and in 18 months, I'm gonna roll into some sweet dental coverage.
So, yeah, my job pretty much rules.
Low on bean!
Low on bean!
I'm low on bean!
I'm good on bean!
Would you like to know what I did at my job all day today?
- Don't say "crushed it".
- I'm gonna go with "crushed it".
Funny enough, uh, I crushed it.
I crushed it all day today, and then I crushed it some more.
And then it asked me what I was doing, and I told it that I was crushing it.
That's what I do on a daily basis, Jess.
You used to inspire me.
I mean, not specifically-- because I find teaching to be icky-- but, you know, in a vague kind of "Look at that go-getter in a in a brightly colored sweater" kind of way.
What happened to the inspiring, visor-less Jess?
Hey, maybe that's her.
Hey, we just moved in across the hall.
I'm Chaz.
This is Fife, Sutton and Brorie.
What's up?
Schmidt.
Any-turds, just wanted to give you a heads up that we're having some people over to hang tonight - and it might get a little loud.
- I like where your head is at.
We're gonna be there with bells on.
Dolla-dolla bells, y'all.
Well, it's just going to be a bunch of young people.
So Hi.
I live here, too.
What are you names?
Schmidt!
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
So, when he said, "It's just going to be a bunch of young people," well, he must have meant, "You," meaning me, fellow young person, "You'll feel right at home.
And you two walking corpses, stay away".
You're six months younger than me, Schmidt.
- You're a corpse for sure.
- Behold.
This actuarial table stops at age 99.
But if you track my current trajectory, I'm clearly gonna live till I'm 123 years old, so Hello, robot sex.
Is this accurate?
No, no, no, Winston, I spend $49.95 a month on a subscription to an inaccurate real-time actuarial service.
Then I think I may have died four years ago.
Oh, yeah?
That sucks.
"African-American male, life expectancy: 67 years"?
Sounds about right.
"Minus one year if you frequently question your career choice".
Check.
"Minus one year if your chosen field offers few opportunities for advancement".
Check and double check.
I like getting older.
I feel like I'm finally aging into my personality.
Keep this crap out of my yard!
And turn that nonsense down!
They never did get that Frisbee back.
- I used that Frisbee as a dish.
Seriously?
- I used it for pistachios in my room.
- Not only am I the youngest person in this loft, I'm also the most successful.
- Oh!
Shut up, Schmidt.
- Are you honestly measuring yourself like a little boy?
I'm sorry that you're not growing any more like me.
And apparently, I'm gonna be growing forever.
I'm like a Jewish Peter Pan.
Petya Pan.
Petter Pan.
Pesach Pan.
Why don't you take it down a notch before this old man takes you outside and makes you pick a switch?
- I'm like Snow Leopard.
You guys are like DOS.
- And as your elder, - Can I give you a little advice, Schmidt?
Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.
- Yes, yes.
- 'Cause you've kind of gotten under my skin - A little bit.
- Shoot, Gran Torino.
I'm gonna die so soon.
Do you think that the neighbors will want, like, four individual casseroles or, like, one large party-size casserole?
Yes, Jess, that's exactly what hip, trendy millennials want to eat: casserole.
Now come on, guys, just tighten up, all right?
- Think young.
What the hell is that smell?
- It's Old Spice.
- I'm smelling Old Spice?
- Yeah, and yes, It has "Old" in the title, and yes, it's all over my body.
- Okay, well, take it off.
- I'm wearing the Spice.
The Spice is cool.
It's not even a real spice, man.
Take it off.
The Spice is coming back!
Everybody knows it!
The guy on the horse!
You can wear any spice.
Don't wear Old Spice!
Classic cologne fight.
- Guys!
- Shh!
Hi.
Zander and Raj went to Pate's thing, so tonight's been notched down to a "chill hang".
Cool.
- I'll just put these - Oh.
Thanks for having us.
No, can't do this.
- What is up?
- Have fun, kids.
Party hip-hop.
What's going on, kids?
Let's party.
What are you guys doing, huh?
What is that?
Is that Top Gun?
Oh, look at that.
Look at Anthony Eds, the "Goose" man.
Unbelievable that he dies in a few scenes.
Goose dies?
Not cool, man.
No, it's Look, nobody does an onscreen death like Anthony Eds.
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald men.
He's like the Hilary Swank of bald Hold everything.
Is that Cass Shant?
Casserole Shanty?
That's where I work.
Your chicken-broccoli totally fuels my night bikes.
I'm very happy to help.
- Some of my friends don't appreciate it.
- No.
You're just figuring it out, just like us.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I am figuring it out.
Thank you, Brorie.
I am.
I'm just figuring it out, and that's okay.
What do you guys do?
- I work at home.
- I'm a DJ.
- Well Was I unclear about my night bikes?
I work for a single-national corporation called Associated Strategies.
Moo - Oh, moo - I know.
Yeah.
Totally, Fife.
I get that.
Moo Moo!
Right?
That's a thing, right?
Yeah?
Moo?
Schmidt, you don't know Jess.
Did I do that?
How did you just come up with that?
Where did you get that?
It just came to me.
Where did that come from?
I just thought of it.
That's how she casseroles!
What?
Hey, Nana, Pop-Pop.
You missed an unreal hang last night.
Unreal with a capital "uh".
Really?
Those kids with the found furniture and no TV because it's cool?
It's a different world over there.
A world where it's okay to only have a part-time job.
A world where it's okay that I'm still finding myself.
A world where I have not one, but two catchphrases.
$500.
How rude!
How rude!
Just take it!
They think I made those up.
There's just one tiny hitch.
It's very awkward, and I don't know how to say it They hate Schmidt.
So much.
How did you know?
If I had a dollar for everybody I couldn't hang out with because they hated Schmidt, I'd be rich.
Like, fill my gas tank all the way up rich.
He was all over the map.
He spent 20 minutes talking about aioli.
Don't worry about it.
I'm on it.
What do you mean, you're on it?
You're gonna prank him, aren't you?
I-I knew it!
I knew it!
You're gonna prank him.
Hey, can I help you?
I'm really good with pranks?
You may not help with the pranks.
Why not, man?
I'm the best with the pranks, man.
- They call me "Prank Sinatra".
- No, you call you Prank Sinatra.
- Oh, come 'Cause I am.
- Winston, you're the worst at pranks in the whole world.
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!
You either go way too small Hey.
Let's pour a little juice near her shoe.
Or you go way too big.
Hey, let's hit her in the throat with a ski.
You don't have a pranking sweet spot.
Speaking of Are you limping?
My hip is achy.
I wonder if it's your shoes.
Did you try different shoes?
I try on four different pairs of shoes with every outfit, rain or shine.
You know that.
What did you do?
Well, he could try on It's not going to matter.
The left heel is an eighth of an inch shorter on every single pair.
This is so crazy, Nick.
Oh, my God, you know what we should do?
We should take those shavings, and then sprinkle them by his car.
Let me just get this clear.
- Take the little bit of dust - Yeah, 'cause - And go outside and put it near his car?
- Yes.
- That's not a prank.
- Yes, it is.
That's just kind of littering.
- His whole ride to work, - Okay, you're done.
He'd be thinking, like, "What"?
So we're pranking him so he thinks while we're not around, "What"?
It's too small.
You've got to go bigger than that.
Well, anyway, - I got to fill this up with pee.
- Ew!
Why?
So I can pour it all over Schmidt's bed and make him think he's incontinent.
That's disgusting, Nick.
Hey, sometimes up close, art is ugly.
I got an idea.
Instead of urine, we use acid.
And put it on his face!
All right?
Jess, do these pants seem long to you?
Nick picked them up from the dry cleaner for me today, and I don't know, I swear they seem longer.
I think your pants look fine.
Okay, Jess, tonight, you're obviously gonna want to follow my lead.
I don't know how to tell you this Um, they hate you.
That's crazy.
It is crazy how much they hate you.
Watch.
Every time you say something, they're gonna change the subject immediately.
That's how you tell if people hate you.
I'm pretty sure I know how to crush it with the kids.
Watch this.
Hey, guys.
What up, yo?
Throw your damn hands up.
We hanging out tonight?
Jess, I love your hair.
- It is so good today.
- Yeah!
Thank you!
- Flowy.
- Yes.
- Really curly.
What do you guys think about the length of my sideburns?
It's new.
Daring or gauche?
I got my plane ticket home for Easter.
Thank you for reminding me, Jess.
Yeah.
No, of course.
I've got, like, a little calendar thing.
You know, I've got a great, um I've got a great plane ticket guy that you We're having another hang tonight Jess.
Got some chokes, hula hoops, sitar.
You should come over.
- Yeah!
- Yeah, no, like, that's the best idea.
Totally.
You, too, Schmidt.
Oh, hey, I got to I got to take this.
Ferguson?
Is that you?
Yeah, t-tonight?
Well, I mean I made plans with Well, look, if that's the comptroller's time line, then that's the comptroller's time line.
Well, hell, yes, send a car!
Jess, do you want to hula-hoop with me all night-slash-forever?
Oh, gosh.
They hate me.
Man, I've never seen you work this hard at anything, ever.
That's because I care so much.
I set an alarm for 5:00 a.m. so I could switch Schmidt's fiber pills with placebos.
Damn it, I want to care about something as much as you care about ruining Schmidt's life.
And where have you been all night, young lady?
Jumping around to your hippity-hop?
Taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick?
I'm actually asking-- I'm not doing a thing right here.
Those guys are so much fun.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been up for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa.
No, there's no time for sleep!
Guys, here's what we got to do.
We got to find the passion that we have in life, and we got to hold on to it.
- You're so right.
- Just like-- I can't believe I'm saying this-- just like Nick Miller.
Why, look at that.
I've never been an inspiration before.
I don't like it.
It's too much responsibility.
Ooh, ay-ay-ay.
I am cons-to-the-pizzo.
Hmm?
Constipated.
I'm constipated.
Surprising.
Here, sit down, relax, watch some TV.
What's the chair doing over here?
Just moved it.
Oh gosh.
Turn it down, man!
Turn it down!
- Turn it What?
- It's too loud!
Schmidt, you're blasting the TV, you maniac!
You can hear that?
It's blasting, Schmidt!
Jess is trying to sleep!
- You can hear this?
- Uh, yes.
Well, you know what, you were right.
They hate me, and I know why they hate me, too.
It's because I'm old, and they're the future of humanity, a pan-ethnic, pan-sexual hive mind, and they want nothing to do with me.
They're not that great, Schmidt.
Last night, Chaz and Sutton - got in a fight.
- A lovers' quarrel?
Sutton and Chaz are not a couple.
Chaz is with Fife; Brorie's with, uh - the other broad.
- Actually, Brorie, Sutton and Fife are in a triad, and Chaz is a floater.
They're poly-amorous?
Damn it!
Jess, you've got to help me - help them forget how old I am.
- You're not old.
- Then how do you explain this?
- Use your legs, buddy.
- Let me show you something.
- Gonna hurt your back.
Look at this-- I'm freaking shrinking!
I took a photo of the wall, shrunk it down, made a copy at an architect's office.
From there, it was just your basic spackle-and-silkscreen job.
I don't care, but yay.
It's a weird life, but it's where I'm at right now.
Okay.
- Jess - this is the hardest thing I've ever had to say.
Please help me be cool.
Say that one more time.
Oh.
Visor-wearing Jess, will you please help me be cool?
Okay, listen up, I got 3.5 years to live.
I can't be an assistant any more.
I don't want to die.
I want to work.
Honestly, I want to work here.
But I got to follow my passion, much like a running back would want when given the ball, and in the game of life, this job is the pigskin.
And damn it, I'm in the red zone!
And in summation, I feel very good about what I just said.
Hopefully, you do, too.
Who wants to start an arcade fire?
Schmidt.
- What?
- What are you doing?
This is not the outfit we talked about.
- What?
Rock and roll.
- You way overshot it.
Look at that.
I'm being ironic.
That's not ironic; That's just a bad pun.
And what are you doing here?
Your arms are hot, but your neck is cold?
Hey, look at me.
If you guys keep a tight core, you can your burpees can look like this, too.
When's the Olympics?
Right, guys?
I'm gonna set a PR tonight.
Well, you know, he's not he's not Parkour.
- Oh!
- Oh!
You got beer on her, man.
Did I do that?
Don't worry, my mom can throw that dress in with my laundry next time she's here.
Sorry.
Your mom does your laundry?
Washer-dryer kind of freaks me out, you know?
It's just, like, eh washa-washa-washa, - guh-guh, guh-guh, uh-guh-guh-guh.
- On the noise.
Okay, you know what?
It's fine.
I'll-I'll wash it myself.
- All right.
- Thank you, though.
She's so iconoclastic and modern.
And she even got our dishwasher to work.
- I remember.
- You know, I mean, I just it wasn't that big a deal.
It was just I just I just turned it on.
There was a button that said "on".
It's weird how the dishwasher just lives under the counter.
How come there's no dish-dryer?
Or un-washer.
Oh, my God, you guys, are we the dish un-washers?
Why don't we just move to Prague?
I need to focus on my art.
You can totally focus on your art in Prague.
If we move to Prague, should I paint my nails black again?
Hey, you guys, um I can't hang out with you any more.
- Why not?
- Because Our entire relationship's built on a lie.
Jess, what are you talking about?
I did not make up - "Did I do that"?
- Jess, please don't - I have to introduce you to a - Don't do it.
Little, adorable African-American nerd.
Don't press the button.
Don't Jess, why would you do this to us?
Who's "Steve Urclee"?
Jess, what the hell was that?
You were supposed to teach me how to be cool.
You did a terrible job.
Look what I'm wearing.
You didn't listen to anything I said!
I told you to stop trying so hard.
I will never stop trying.
I don't care if I have to do a billion burpees.
That is how you crush-- you never give up.
That is the difference between me and you, Jess.
Is that what you think?
You think I just gave up?
- Well - I was fired, Schmidt.
Do you think I wanted to stop teaching?
That's why I liked hanging out with those kids-- 'cause they weren't judging me all the time for not crushing it.
- Okay - Do you think that I want to work At the Casserole Shanty?
Do you know what the people I work with call it?
The Ass-erole Shanty.
Just don't stop teaching.
I mean, there's got to be something.
- I don't know, driver's ed, CPR - Uh A smile class.
My life sucks so much right now.
But at least I'm not 23.
At least I own a trash can.
At least I can legally rent a car.
At least I don't live in a loft with three other But you live with us.
But I live you with guys.
Jess?
We don't care if you stole your catchphrase from some low-budget Web series.
We still want to hang out.
Don't trust your government, kids.
Oh, my God, it's the old man from the stairs.
I thought he died.
Let's get out of here before his robe opens.
- He's gonna get his old on you!
Get out while you can!
- Hey, hey, Charles, The decrepit thing that just walked by, now, that is old, okay?
And you can hate him for being old, but you cannot hate me.
We don't hate you for being old.
We hate you 'cause you're a viciously unbearable ass-head.
Seriously?
That's Come here, that's Get off!
Ass-head!
Ass-head!
Yeah!
- I'm not gonna drink it all.
- Guys, I am an ass-head.
They don't hate me because I'm old.
They hate me because of my personality.
I can totally change my personality.
Congratulations, Schmidt, that is that's weird news.
Ladies and gentlemen, you are looking at a brand-new man.
A man who has proved so capable of talking about so little for so long is now the producer of his very own sports talk show.
- No way!
- What?
!
That's right.
That's right.
- Yeah, baby!
- It's halftime in America!
Man, that's amazing!
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Boom!
Prime time for truckers!
- That's awesome.
He's got something.
- Yes.
In other news, I just spent three days trying to impress people who don't own bed frames.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I spent the last three days pouring urine on a grown man's sheets.
Can you imagine how much we would get done if we just focused our energy onto something a little bit more worthwhile?
- Not to mention the money we would save.
- I know.
Wait, what money?
I mean, I've been running the numbers on this, but, you know, I think I spent you know, $1,200 to $1,300.
- What?
!
- on these pranks, yeah.
- What?
!
- And I was under- budget, so Under-budget?
What, you think fake contact lenses are free?
- They are not, sister.
- Nick, you don't have that kind of money.
I know I don't.
Where are you gonna get that from?
Doesn't matter.
I had to prank Schmidt.
And I did.
Holy crap.
- I need a real job.
- Yeah, you do.
Don't you ever prank me!
Of course.
You got it.
You'll never see it coming.
This is like the end of a horror movie.
Or the beginning of a pranking movie.
There are no pranking movies.
Yet.
Get out of here.
You'll never see it coming.
This prescription is blurry.
Hi, Schmidt.
Is that you in tailored, grown-up clothing?
Yeah.
Mama's gonna ride this blazer - all the way to a tutoring job.
- Thank goodness.
I almost thought I was gonna have to loan you money.
Well, I said tutoring job, not venture capitalist.
- Proud of you nonetheless.
- Thanks.
What the hell?
Okay.
All right, Nick, very funny.
Quite the prankster you are.
Ha!
I'm gonna hit your ass with a ski!
- Winston?
- Get some.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Happy birthday, dude!
- Hello.
- I made you a cake.
Can't.
Booked a car show for tomorrow, and I have been so good this week.
- I lost four pounds.
- Oh, come on, Cece.
It's your birthday.
We're gonna eat cake, we're gonna watch Clueless on VHS, and we're gonna try to make prom dresses out of towels.
Obviously, just like we always do.
As if!
As if is, like, the funniest thing ever.
I wish I had a stepbrother to fall in love with.
I know, right?
Paul Rudd.
You know, actually, I thought maybe this year, we could go out, you know?
We go party tonight.
Let dogs out.
Catch gypsy.
Yeah.
Yeah, Nadia wants me to go to this last-minute thing she found out about, so I thought we could all, you know, just go out tonight.
- You, me, Nadia, the girls.
- The models?
Yes, Jess, the models.
Please?
You and I have never spent my birthday apart, ever.
Except for the one time in seventh grade where you walked out of my sleepover because - you claimed - When you struck me in the breast.
But I didn't even touch boob, because you know, - we all knew you were stuffing - Oh, my God.
We were all stuffing.
Stuffing?
We all stuffed.
- You've seen my grandmother.
I was not stuffing.
- Yes, we were.
- It was seventh grade.
- I've been like this since I was seven.
- You're - Come out with us tonight!
- Please, please, please!
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I'll come.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
I so excited.
I shake this thing that my mama gave me.
YOLO!
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- It's Jess.
The Galapagos tortoise, - or Galapagos giant tortoise, - Unbelievable Is the largest living species of tortoise Spectacular.
Hey, do you think Jess would be mad if I got a turtle and named it Jess, even though I had that name picked out before she moved in?
- A turtle?
- Thinking man's best friend, Schmidty.
In our home?
Over my turtle-disease-ridden dead body.
Whatever, dream killer.
What's this?
Got you a cookie.
What, you have, like?
Have, like, an extra?
No.
So you just, like, got me a cookie?
Yeah, I was thinking about you.
What do you mean you were thinking about me?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I was thinking about you.
Think about you a lot, bro.
Why?
I don't know.
Because you're my friend, you're on my mind.
What, do you not think about me?
Of course not!
Oh.
Schmidt got me a cookie.
Oh.
Very nice.
What do you guys think?
- Whoa!
- - Smokin' hot.
I'm going out tonight with Cece and her model friends, and I'm going for "promising ballerina turned streetwalker".
You have too much joie de vivre.
Okay, you want to look a little bit more bored, tired.
Just altogether disengaged.
More tired-- more, like, sick-like.
Really let your bones prop you up.
Did you put shoe polish on your eyes?
I never understand you women-- God.
- Eye shadow, man.
- That's?
Oh, that's makeup?
I would take that off.
That looks crazy.
Can't believe I have to deal with the models just to hang out with Cece.
Last time we hung out, it was awful.
I figure the best way to talk to models is just point to objects and describe them.
The table is round.
It's also flat.
Yes, the table is round, and it's flat.
Oh, look, a lamp.
I love Cece, and these are Cece's friends, so I should be able to get along with them.
I should be able to deal with the fact that they think I look like a monkey from a Russian cracker ad.
Whatever.
It's Cece's birthday.
It's her special night.
I can get drunk, point at furniture if that means I can spend some quality time with my BFF.
Hey, is it totally obvious that I'm not wearing underwear?
Because it should be.
And that makes two of us.
Hey!
- You made it!
- Sorry I'm late.
They let in a lot of people ahead of me-- like, a lot.
Saving the best for last.
Monkey cracker.
Monkey cracker.
Monkey, monkey, where you keep the crackers?
This is so much fun.
Schmidt?
So, it turns out there's more than one type of turtle.
I could go Eastern Box, or spur thighed, or nearsighted loner.
What was that?
You just grunt at me?
- Wasn't a grunt.
- That was a grunt, Schmidt.
- It was a "hurumph".
Hurumph.
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way; it was not a grunt.
Serena Williams.
That was a grunt.
It's all good, man, all right?
It's all "smoove in the groove".
Mellow, man.
Mega-mellow.
Okay.
Schmidt, what the hell are you doing?
You don't think about me?
- What are you talking about?
- Earlier today, when I gave you the cookie, I heard very clearly, "I don't think about you, Schmidt".
- Why would I think about you?
!
- Because we're friends, we're not animals.
We're men, Schmidt!
The only time a man is allowed to think about another man is when that man is Jay Cutler.
I don't know who Jay Cutler is!
Why are you saying "Cutler" like that?
And I also don't know what is allowed in the Cold-Hearted Republic of Nick Miller, but I do know how I feel.
- Ugh!
- And I know how much you love cookies.
And I saw it there behind the glass, and I thought, "Nick Miller-- I'm gonna buy him that".
If I could give you that cookie back, I would.
Nothing would make me happier than to throw it up, mash it into cookie-shape, and shove it down your throat!
- You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
- No, that's not - You wanna mama-bird me the cookie?
- No.
You're not mama-birding anybody any cookie.
Schmidt, I don't want to mama-bird you a cookie.
What is your problem, Schmidt?
No mama-birding here!
Okay, I think I got it, okay-- Monkey, monkey Where you keep your cracker?
Monkey, monkey, you are comrade best!
- Whoo.
- You know what?
The dance is surprisingly sexual for a children's cracker.
- Do song again-- "Dance Monkey".
- I don't want to dance "Dance Monkey".
Monkey, monkey Where you keep your crackers?
- Dance monkey, dance monkey.
- Cracker, please!
- Dance monkey.
- Cracker, please!
- Monkey!
Monkey!
- No.
You know what?
Monkey!
Monkey!
Monkey!
Monkey!
Monkey!
Monkey, monkey, monkey!
- Dance Monkey - - You know what?
No!
Stop it!
I don't want to, okay?
I'm done.
You guys are the worst!
You're the worst.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
All these racist in-jokes about Romanians.
Well, guess what?
I'm one-eighth Romanian!
- Monkey, no!
- And I don't know why Cece would want to spend her birthday here.
It's like years of modeling have made her dumber.
- Nice, Jess.
- No!
Cece.
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't It's official.
We got to turtle-proof this loft.
Schmidt cares about you so much, man, and you don't even think about him.
Are you being serious right now?
Are you really taking Schmidt's side on this?
I am, because I know how you are.
I just don't know why he would run away.
All I ever did was love him.
This rock is so round.
I'm gonna go put it in a jar.
And nothing has changed.
Nothing has changed, Nick.
You think Schmidt is in the right, and I am in the wrong here?
You realize I say good night to you every night, and you never say good night back?
- No.
- What is the problem, Nick?
Do you not want me to have a good night?
I can't just go around saying good night to everyone, and buying people cookies.
I am not a titan of finance, sir.
Do you know, once a week he goes into your room and cleans it, and then returns everything the way he found it?
- And I'm weird in this situation?
- The dirty old T-shirts, which he washes.
I didn't ask for that-- I like living in my filthy messes.
That's the point, man.
You didn't have to ask.
Nobody buys people cookies for no reason.
You still don't get it, do you?
- Nobody.
- That wasn't a cookie, damn it!
That was a - What?
- Man, that was a piece of his heart.
Now, if you don't mind, good night.
I'm sorry, but in my defense, Nadia just spent an hour explaining to me how to drink vodka with my butt.
You just embarrassed me in front of my colleagues.
Are you kidding me?
It's not like you work in the UN.
You judge me for being a model.
- Yes, I do.
- You always have.
It's your birthday, and you won't eat cake.
Cece, you're better than that; you really are.
I just I just feel sorry for you sometimes.
You feel sorry for me?
You just hit me in the boob.
- It was an accident.
- It was not an accident.
Fine.
It wasn't.
Oh my God!
Ho, ho.
What?
Huh?
- Huh?
- You want that?
!
- Go.
Just go.
- Ugh!
Uh!
What you gonna do now, huh?
- Just - What?
- What?
What?
What?
- What?
- What?
What?
- What?
You should go.
Thanks for a great birthday.
Cece?
You drink with mouth?
Tonight, I drink with mouth.
Well, guess who's not getting a turtle?
They were out of turtles.
I bought a tiny cowboy hat for nothing.
- Schmidt's not talking to you right now.
- We're still on this?
Schmidt is tired of doing things for you that go unnoticed.
lining your shoes up at the door Don't line my shoes up at the door any more.
- Recording your favorite TV shows - I appreciate that.
- The turn-down service.
- The turn-down service is weird - And I never asked you to do that.
- Well, I guess those chocolate mints - Just disappeared on their own.
- Oh, I thought we weren't talking.
- We're not.
- Then why do I hear words Coming out that stupid hole in your face?
I'm a human being, and I'm entitled to my emotions.
Are you crying?
No.
Are you seriously crying, Schmidt?
I'm not crying.
Rough night, you guys.
I forgot to take out my contacts.
I think they're fused to my eyeballs.
What's going on?
Did you guys watch porn together again?
Why do you keep doing that?
It's always awkward.
Oh, wow.
What the hell was that?
In March, I will have been living with Schmidt for ten years.
I know that because he sent me an e-mail asking how I want to celebrate our "tin anniversary".
How did you guys become friends?
Was it an accident?
Did you hit him with your car and you became his reluctant caretaker?
He lived in my freshman dorm.
And one day, he was just there.
Hey, hey, whoa, man, what are you doing in here?
That's my ramen.
It's better this way.
Y-You add water to it, you weirdo.
It's not a dry treat, it's a soup.
- Who are you?
- Schmidt.
You freak me out, man.
This is cool.
We got a good vibe going, man.
You're a super weird guy.
Hey, sit there while I throw things at you.
- Body slam!
- No!
Don't do this!
No!
And then he was always there.
And the truth is, is, Schmidt loves me so much, and to be honest, Jess, it scares me.
I mean, I don't think I deserve all of Schmidt's love.
All I do is tease him.
I mean, of course you do.
That's all you can do.
Do you think I'm a bad friend?
No, no, I'm a bad friend.
I got mad at Cece for being a model.
It's a dumb thing to be.
We got in a boob fight.
- Feels like I fell forward on a treadmill.
- I'm just gonna say this-- I find that arousing, and let's move on.
Just, she's smart, you know, and she's interesting and she could be doing anything else with her life or at least trying.
You know, the weird thing is, I was actually there when she got discovered.
You, take your glasses off.
Okay.
I can take my glasses off.
I guess I was always disappointed with her for calling that lady.
It's just, when I hear all the stuff about Cece's profession-- like, the dieting-- it's crazy-- and the butt drinking and the Did you say "butt drinking"?
- Yeah.
- You can't say "butt drinking" - And then not explain what it is.
- Yeah.
It has two of my four favorite things.
- I just feel like we have nothing in common, you know?
- Yeah.
Do you ever wonder why we're friends with these people, Jess?
And, worse, if we met them now, you think we'd still be friends with them?
Maybe not.
I should go talk to her.
Well, Nick, I'm out of tears-- plumb out.
All that's left is just yellowish goo.
That's right, Nick-- goo.
That's a third of my life.
Cece.
Oh, hey, Nadia, sorry.
This Wilmer Valderrama.
Um, Nadia, that's not-- I mean-- or what I thought he would look like in person.
Nice to meet you.
Big fan.
Where's Cece?
Cece drink too much.
She puke, puke, puke.
She puke, cry, puke, cry.
She's so weak.
You put on pajama, Wilmer Valderrama, top only.
Then, you make me salad, bitch.
Let's, let's get you into bed, okay?
I don't think we're doing any modeling today.
No, I have to go, Jess, I have to go.
It's my job, all right?
You know what, Cece?
I'm so sorry about last night.
I know that you're I know you're an intelligent person, and sometimes I just I just get mixed up, you know, And I think that you're like me.
Don't, don't worry, I'm here.
Just tell me where to stand and what we're selling.
I'm gonna give it everything I got.
I'm calling your agency.
This is totally unprofessional.
Don't call my agency.
Just tell me where to stand.
Up on the spinning platform.
- Yeah, I can't do that.
- Okay.
- Please, no, seriously don't.
I can't lose this job.
- No.
Don't call the agency, okay?
- I'll do it.
- What?
I'm actually a model, too, mostly in Japan.
Um, they call me Giggle Bangs Rice Bowl.
I know you're lying and I just don't care.
Get over to hair and makeup now.
Cool.
These things are heavy.
It's like chain mail on my eyes.

I didn't know what to get you.
And then I was thinking I was gonna get you ramen like we used to eat, but you probably eat, like, fancy ramen now with, like, figs in it.
I don't know, man.
You love me too much, Schmidt, and you picked the wrong guy.
And when are you gonna get that through that giant head of yours?
I'm just gonna let you down, man.

Why is it so hard?
You make it look a lot harder.

You've always been braver than me.

You should see the other guys.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Nick, where do you even buy sheets like this?
They're the thread count of a paper towel.
Okay, I don't know what to do.
I thought these sheets were good.
You said these sheets were fine.
They're fine.
Relax.
He's freaking out.
You know, Amelia's coming in town Which one of your depressing ex-girlfriends is Amelia?
Freshman year.
You stopped in my room For no reason I was pretty cool to say "Come in" You're sitting on my bed I feel like there's vibing What do I do?
The sexual tension is crazy.
I never told her how I felt.
And she's here for a couple days on work.
This is my chance.
I even got a new shirt.
That's a cool shirt; I like that shirt.
Yeah, look cool, man.
You making fun of my shirt, Schmidt?
Oh, my God!
Jess, please stop working at the haunted house.
It's just through the weekend.
You all get free tickets, you know.
Oh, no, I'm not going.
I don't do haunted houses.
- What?
You scared?
- Uh, well, Little kids are scared.
I just don't like it.
I got it.
You look like a zombie Woody Allen.
- Yeah.
- These brains are terrible.
And such-such small portions.
On Christmas, I like to eat Chinese people's brains.
They're the only ones that are open.
Zombie Cristina Barcelona.
Yeah, I have nothing to add to this.
I'm gonna be home late tonight, you guys.
Uh, so don't wait up, 'cause I'm going over to Sam's house to mix his batter.
Oh, yeah.
Not in that costume.
- I don't know.
- Costume kind of works for me.
Kind of a sexy, undead driver's ed teacher.
It's my sweet spot.
Sam doesn't care what I look like.
'Cause I'm not his girlfriend.
And I'm gonna kick him to the curb once I've used his body like a moisturizer sample.
Hey-yo!
I couldn't afford my therapist, so I ate his brains.
Marx brothers.
Hear, hear.
- That's the one.
- Good stuff.
Who's that girl?

- It's Jess.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
Oh, oh.
Oh.
Um, here's your wallet.
Oh, thank you.
You must have dropped it on our most recent trip to No Pants City.
Just so you know, I didn't look in it.
'Cause I don't care and I respect your privacy.
Then how'd you know it was - my wallet?
- Well played, Sam Sweeny-- Born in Boston, six-four.
I didn't know you worked in the E.R. Until I got here, though.
Yeah, pediatrics.
You're a doctor for children.
It's, you know, mostly paperwork.
That why you have so many cute cards on the wall?
"Dear Dr. Sam" They call you Dr. Sam?
"Thank you for making me better.
I love you, and so does my bunny".
Nice kid, but she can't draw for crap.
I mean, she just traced Bugs Bunny.
I didn't know you were a, like, caring person.
Same guy.
Same guy.
I'm the same guy that did you in that falafel restaurant, you remember?
- And a dirty one, at that.
- Mm-hmm.
- Please don't do this.
- Dr. Sam.
Don't start thinking I'm some amazing guy.
This is why I don't tell girls what I do.
This doesn't change the way I feel about you.
I feel nothing.
This is purely physical.
Dr. Sam!
Oh, Ben!
What's up?
Fish tails?
I, uh How could I say no, buddy?
Fish tail!
Fish tail!
Up top!
This makes me feel nothing.
I feel nothing.
I haven't worn these in years.
Here you go.
Wow, Schmidt.
You've got so many boots.
You know who doesn't have a lot of boots?
Guys who aren't getting laid on the reg.
- Ooh, trust me, I know.
Shelby and I agreed - Mm-hmm.
That we're gonna dress sexy this Halloween, so hopefully that'll make us want to have sex with each other.
You know, at night, I can actually feel gusts of frigid air coming from beneath your door.
I get it, Schmidt.
We're in a rut.
Without sex, she's not your girlfriend, okay?
She's a friend that you buy meals for.
Winston, I get it, man.
You're you're scared to end it.
You're just like Cece.
Cece's scared to end it with Robby, because clearly she's still nuts about me.
Robby's nice.
Good guy, man.
He always has gum.
"Oh, Robby-- he's such a nice guy".
I'll show you nice guy.
Boom.
Punch him in his face.
Yeah, put you in a guillotine choke hold.
And then Robby's like, "Oh, my God"!
"I can't believe this.
Young Abraham Lincoln is choking me out in his guillotine".
You're going as young Abe Lincoln for Halloween?
Statistically speaking, every American thinks about Abraham Lincoln at least once a day.
And Cece's American, so Thank you for that information, Schmidt.
Yeah.
What's up, Robby?
What's up, Robby, you stupid idiot?
You had an alter ego, remember?
Yeah.
The guy who'd been in a coma who woke up thinking he had invented pie.
Oh, I got a great new idea for a dessert!
Wait a second, what year is it?
That's awesome you liked that.
No, I'm really glad you're here.
Welcome to Los Angeles.
L.A., as the locals call it.
This is the city where many scenes from the film Beverly Hills Chihuahua were shot.
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.
- Mm-hmm.
I made you up a couch.
- Wow.
- The double eye patch.
- You trying to impress me?
- Yes!
Absolutely!
You kidding?
- A doctor?
- Mm-hmm.
I had him pegged for a part-time tennis pro or an unemployed handsome guy.
He cares about people for a living; it's so much hotter.
You're starting to like him now.
No, no, no, we're just coworkers.
On the night shift.
These fit great, Jess.
Really, thank you so much.
It's like a childhood dream come true for me.
To be a Ninja Turtle.
And to have a beautiful girlfriend, of course.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
What am I looking at here?
Robby, man to man, you didn't want to wear something, I don't know, a little more form flattering?
Maybe like a pile of towels, the number eight?
- Schmidt.
- I know.
But how could I not knock down such low-hanging fruit?
Speaking of low-hanging fruit, Jess, you didn't want to let out - the pants a little bit?
- No.
- Not even a touch?
- No.
You want to look at your work?
Looks great.
Not to an eight-year-old child.
Who's just staring right down the barrel.
- Enough.
- Are you guys coming to the Halloween festivities tomorrow?
- Actually, we're - I think you should come.
It's for charity.
You like charity, Robby, right?
Yeah, sure.
Like Cece dating you.
Awesome.
Um - Why not?
- No.
I mean, - We have that thing - Don't worry about my friends.
I would love to hang out with your friends.
I think we should do it, because I want to wear this costume out.
You know what I mean?
So I say yes.
Just, uh, keep the pumpkins away from me, okay?
I kind of cut myself last Halloween.
I mean, not on a knife.
I-I, you know, I cut myself on the pumpkin.
You should've made a move in college.
No, I didn't have moves, Amelia.
My moves were Singing to you and trying to give you back rubs and I do remember you picking a lot of eyelashes off my cheeks.
Didn't you think it was weird that I kept showing up at your door, telling you I had a family tragedy?
How many grandparents did you think I had?
I had a bad bag of moves, lady.
Well, they're not bad any more, Nick Miller.
Ah, that's great.
That is for real.
There's more where that came from.
Uh-oh.
Oh, that's good stuff.
That is good.
Hey.
Sam's in there.
- Yeah, Amelia's in there.
- High five for sluts.
- Yeah!
Hey.
I think I might like Sam.
Jess, I thought the whole thing was how you didn't like him.
I know, but then Hey.
Hi.
You must be Amelia.
I'm Jess.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nick's told me a lot about you.
Yes, I did.
Yeah, it finally happened.
It's crazy-- Nick and Amelia.
- Together.
- Together, yeah.
- Together, yeah.
- Together.
Really?
Right now?
Okay.
Yeah, good.
Okay.
All right, call me tonight?
Actually, tonight's the last night of this haunted house thing.
Here's a crazy idea.
What if you came?
Well, I don't really do, uh, the, you know, sort of costume thing.
I'm gonna be dressed up.
I think you should dress up, too.
'Cause it'd be cool.
For me.
Okay.
I'll try to make it, darling.
Well, I wish I hadn't have seen that.
You wish you hadn't seen that?
- I wish I hadn't seen - Fair point.
What if tonight's a test?
If he shows up wearing a costume, he likes me.
- Sound logic.
- I know.
Jess, I-I Jess, I was kidding.
How do the boots feel, man?
Feel fantastic, man.
Well, there's more where that came from.
Got a lot of boots.
Whoo, looky here!
One of my brothers in blue.
That gun looks real.
Let me see that for a second.
LAPD!
Stand down!
Stand down!
I'm standing, I'm standing!
Look at that!
Butch it up, Axel Foley.
Shelby's coming.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
What, uh What-what are you?
I'm reigning cats and dogs!
Get it?
Reigning cats and dogs.
Those stuffed animals are gonna look good on the floor of my bedroom.
Oh!
What are you doing?
!
No, it's cool, it's cool.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, Robby.
Hey, look, I get it.
Guy who shot John Lennon - dressed as a Ninja Turtle.
- No.
Cece, you're an angel, as always.
Get off my horse, Schmidt.
Hey, Lincoln, right?
That's awes You know, I was just thinking about Lincoln today.
Yeah, Robby, we all were.
This is kind of funny.
The two of you together on that horse, you kind of look like a bride and a groom.
I will throw you off of this horse with my bare hands.
I will.
I'm gonna tell him how I feel tonight.
- You are?
- Think so.
Boo!
What'd you carve here?
Oh, it's a secret.
I'm not done yet.
What's wrong with me?
I wanted this for so long with her, and now it's just too much.
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.
You want to know why I don't like haunted houses?
- Why?
- Because they're just like relationships.
You walk in all confident, and then once you get in, it's not what you thought it was gonna be, and it's scary.
Nice, you've liked her for a long time.
Go in the "haunted house".
I'm gonna go in the "haunted house".
Ta-da!
That's me, that's you, and that's our dog.
I look so scared.
Bride and groom?
No!
No, I'm here with the Ninja Turtle!
Bride and Ninja Turtle.
I don't get it.
I don't get it, either.
Like she lost a bet or something.
What is wrong with you?
Seriously!
It's okay, Cece.
No, it's not okay!
You need to go home and change, Schmidt.
I know you have more costumes in your closet.
Those costumes are for Purim.
Purim's in March.
I don't care!
You're doing this intentionally just to mess with me!
All right, calm down.
Everybody just just calm down.
All right, Schmidt?
Let's take a walk.
Let's take a walk.
Look, let's just cut the crap, okay?
I know you think I'm dumb, and you can hit on Cece and make fun of me all day long, but I'm not going anywhere, all right?
You're a big guy, you know that?
Yeah.
Luckily, I've got a stone forehead.
What?
I'm sorry.
- No, it's cool, man.
- You just tried to head-butt me.
- I had to stop you.
- No, yeah, yeah.
- I got you.
I got you.
- All right.
- Damn it!
- Schmidt, you did it again.
How do you see that coming every time?
You wind up.
You make, like, a little wind-up thing.
- I just - Hit me right in the forehead.
Yeah, well, you tried to head-butt me with your forehead.
Yeah, I know I was trying to head-butt you.
Okay, listen.
I think there's two options here.
We can either go the way that things have been going and we're going to have a big problem, or we can just knock this off and let's be friends, okay?
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.
I'm sorry, too.
- I'm sorry, too.
- My bad.
- No, truce.
- All right, truce.
Will you stop trying to head-butt me, man?
I just Look at this guy.
- Looking great.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- He came.
He's not wearing a costume.
Yeah, but he came, so - Hey.
- Hey.
Oh, I got to sneeze.
I'm a clown for you.
Just don't ask me to wear this in bed.
Okay.
I think, when he comes here tonight, I'm just going to be like, "Sam, crazy idea-- why don't we take this to another level"?
And pretend like I'm just thinking of it, but I'm not - Can you hand me my coffee?
- Yeah.
Zombie, just tell him the truth.
Mummy's right.
Take the big swing.
It's okay to be vulnerable.
You guys are right.
Life as a doctor.
Your phone must just be blowing up with life-saving texts, huh?
"Don't die on me, Danny Boy!
Use the paddles"!
No, it's a girl.
Oh, I thought Jess was working.
It's another girl.
Just a weekend thing.
Does Jess know you're texting other girls?
Yeah.
We're, like, totally honest with each other.
You know?
I mean, she wants a relationship less than I do.
It's actually awesome.
Right.
And you're coming over tonight, hmm?
And she's going to talk to you.
Ooh.
All right, man.
You've got to be kidding me.
Just do it, Nick.
Don't be scared, Nick.
You're a grown man.
This is a haunted house.
Game time.
I have no idea how they deep-fry a turkey dinner, but I am so glad they do because I love it.
Do you love your legs?
Because, I'll tell you, diabetes doesn't.
- Where have you been?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I totally lost track of time.
We decided that we're going to hang out more.
All of us are going to hang out more.
You know, 'cause I remember you saying - that missed hanging out with Schmidt, so - Oh, Robby.
- You said that?
- Yeah, I yeah, I I said it, but No, because I want to hang out with you, too.
With Robby there?
Yeah, with Robby there.
- Good.
- Good.
- Oh, yeah, good, good.
- Good.
Lincoln, bringing the nation back together again.
Jess!
Jess, where are you?
Watch your step!
It's just a recording.
Good, good.
Fun.
Okay.
It's not a race.
It's not a Welcome to the morgue, Officer and Sorry.
I have no idea what that whole thing I don't I'm reigning cats and dogs.
- What?
- "Reigning" like a queen, But but "raining" like the weather.
No.
"It's raining cats and dogs"!
- Right.
- It's a joke.
- Not really.
- What?
Hmm?
No, I'm saying, like, it's not really not really funny.
- It's hilarious.
- I thought you were going to dress sexy.
A sense of humor is sexy.
I don't want to date the queen of Cats and Dogs.
- Reigning cats and dogs.
- Makes no sense.
I don't see the queen of England running around - with a cape and British people stapled to it.
- What?
When is the last time you heard somebody say, "Man, you know what's sexy?
A woman with stuffed animals taped to her back".
Look how good I look!
Look how stylish I look.
That's not sexy.
I feel like I'm getting a speeding ticket.
Ooh!
Shelby, you made me so mad, my mustache is coming off!
Why do you have a mustache glued on top of your mustache.
Why aren't we having sex?
- Shut up, bitch.
- Sorry.
Shelby, this is not working.
It's just not.
I know.
Oh, I get it.
Reigning cats and dogs.
It's funny.
It is.
Jess.
Jessica Day, where are you?
No, no!
Very effective.
Very scary.
Come in!
Come in!
This is fun.
This is entertaining.
Oh, no!
Jess!
No!
No!
- Jess!
No!
- No, I'm her friend.
Somebody help me!
This is my nightmare!
I didn't punch a girl.
I punched a horrifying monster.
You of all people should know this, Frankenstein.
You're the real monster.
Oh, give me a break.
Jess, are you okay?
Yeah.
It's nothing.
Nick just punched me in the face.
- What?
!
- Oh, my God!
No, it was an acc - What is wrong with you?
- Jess, I'm sorry!
All right.
Look away.
All right, well, the bruise is going to heal, but I don't know what to do about the giant stitches.
I mean, those are going to scar.
And you're looking a little pale.
What have you been eating?
Brains.
Habit.
I think we should go.
Sam.
Uh, wait.
Um um uh, I I like you.
- I like you, too, Jess.
- No, but, um I care about you, and, um, I want to ask you out for real.
So will you go out with me?
I can't.
I told you what I wanted, and I wasn't lying.
Yeah, um I just thought maybe - you were scared to say it.
- I'm not.
Not scared, you know.
This is how I feel.
Do you want me to go?
- Hey.
- Hey.
You punch a girl?
Yes, I did.
Uh, I'm a coward.
I'm scared of haunted houses.
And I'm scared of you-- I always have been.
That's right.
That is what I've been trying to remember.
I was like, "Nick is great".
Why didn't I realize it years ago"?
And it's because you could not tell me how you felt.
So you always knew I liked you?
You drove me home every Thanksgiving break.
You lived in Chicago; I lived in Florida.
Well, I was trying to avoid the tolls.
How do you feel about me now?
Great.
Good.
I can't believe that after all this time, you still can't be honest with me.
I'm sorry, all right?
It's my fault.
Okay, I fell in love with you the first time I saw you-- that's crazy.
I didn't even know you.
It was just this idea of you.
And then it just wasn't what I thought.
And what's up with the way you kiss?
It's like reverse CPR.
It's like you're Hey.
I'm not an idea of a person.
I'm an actual person.
- Okay.
- Ready?
Uh-huh.
One, two, three.
All right, let's try it one more time.
Let's see if we can hit the top.
I think you guys deserve the couples costumes.
Bride and groom.
- Aw.
- How sweet of you.
- Thank you.
- Take the hat.
It's that's, like, the most important part.
- Very nice of you to do that, Schmidt.
- Hold this.
Okay, I'm not I don't need to wear a second costume.
This and the hat and the blazer's enough, so that's - You need it, Robby.
- Where you going with this here, buddy?
I - You're not going to the pants, too?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- We're fine.
We're good.
- It's important, man.
Need to wear the whole thing.
Just what are you going to wear?
Plan B was always Matthew McConaughey in Magic Mike, so Always got to have a plan B, Robby.
Thanks, man.
Wow.
I mean, look at his thighs.
They're like fleshy tree trunks.
Whoa.
I mean, he just knows how to work the crowd.
I mean, his thighs are, like, the size of my head.
- Reigning cats and dogs!
- Yeah!
Coat of arms.
You are so awesome!
You know, I may not actually be Abraham Lincoln, but I witnessed the emancipation of one black guy tonight from a terrible relationship.
Come on.
I know I said you shouldn't put yourself out there, but I'm glad you did.
You should be with somebody who's crazy about you, Jess.
Thanks, Nick.
That'd be really nice if it wasn't coming from somebody who just punched me in the face.
Sorry about that.
- All right, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.
Let's do it.
All right.
Let's do it.
Okay.
- Jess, let's make this right.
- All right.
I can't do this.
I'm glad you're you, 'cause Jess Day could Ow!
Mother of Damn it!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Okay, gas, electric, and cable comes out to $219.34.
Jessica?
Do you have anything to contribute?
- Here we go.
- They're not all legal tenders, - but they have value, like - Sure.
- That's $5.00.
- $5.00.
Library card.
- Library's not just for books any more.
- Mm-hmm.
- Library card.
- Also, you can check out compact discs.
- What else?
This is a fortune.
- Um, yeah.
"You are lucky and success".
How ironic.
That's going right to the gas company.
"Paid in full".
Jess, we can't keep covering for you.
Yes.
I understand.
It's just that, um recently I went through a, uh, life change where I was fired.
Maybe I can borrow the money from my good friend Winston?
You know, I really wish I could, Jess, but, uh I'm a single man now, so basically I have to be able to trick women into thinking that I can buy them stuff.
Okay!
Here is my share to the penny.
Yeah!
I'm not the poorest!
Second poorest.
Now you're the poorest.
- That's gotta be rock bottom.
- Yeah, I got it.
You know what?
I'm shutting off the gas until you can get me the money.
- What?
- What are you talking about?
Don't scapegoat me.
I just gave you my money.
That's called tough love, all right?
No more handouts.
Now, what are you going to do about it?
How are you gonna pay the gas bill?
- I don't know.
- I've got an idea.
Get a job.
The school year's already started.
I have a lot of decisions to make as far as my rÃ©sumÃ© is concerned.
spacing, columns Okay, just update your rÃ©sumÃ©, you ninny.
- Did you call me a ninny?
- Yeah, I called you a ninny, 'cause you're acting like a ninny, you ninny!
Don't call me a ninny, I'm PMSing!
Ah!
Why would you yucky!
No, no, no.
- I don't want to hear it.
- It hurts.
I feel like I've laid a million eggs and they're all hatching.
I feel like I want to murder someone, and also I want soft pretzels.
You know what?
I feel the same way.
Shut up!
Shut up, you!
'Cause I don't want to hear it!
I've had it!
If any of you cross me, I'm gonna kick the testicles clean off your body!
Clean off!
You'll look like Ken dolls down there.
Because that's where I'm at right now.
Now which one of you guys wants to tell me to get a job?
Hmm?
Who wants to look me in the face and tell me to get a job?
Whatever.
"Whatever"?
What does that mean, huh?
Whatever.
It better mean, "Whatever you say, Jess".
I don't think it's fair that women have an excuse once a month to act irrationally angry when the rest of us have to keep it together all the time.
You're irrationally angry What are you talking about?
I will push if I want to push!
Come on!
I hate doors!
Really?
Well, that's just your personal opinion, 'cause I don't have anger issues.
You guys think I have anger issues?
Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it an issue.
An issue is something you can fix.
Been that way since I can remember.
This is some watered-down nonsense.
You're some no-good shysters!
On an unrelated note, I've just decided to take a walk.
Fine!
Leave!
Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm gonna go get a job, like it's my Job?
Shut up!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Please don't do that, sir.
Please.
I would love to sit by myself right now.
There's something real creepy about you, pal.
You want to get weird?
Let's get weird.
You got a nice face.
Anger problem?
Living with them?
Are you kidding me?
It's frustrating.
It's like just get a job.
I like your hat.
I like how it's not a team or a logo, it's just blue.
Would you rather be covered in fish scales or feathers?
Scales?
Wow, you weirdo.
You want to see me jump really high?
Ha!
Ah ha!
I'm afraid of dying, man.
Who am I?
!
The enemy is en-e-my.
The enemy is the inner me.
Can you understand a word I'm saying?
You just nod at everything.
I need to change.
And you've showed me that.
I have an anger problem.
Thank you.
Can I get a hug?
- I've got a story for you guys.
- Ooh.
I met someone at work.
Emma Sharpe.
Divisional VP of all North America.
Wh-What are you doing in the break room?
This break room is in North America, isn't it?
Sure.
That means I'm the Vice President of it.
I am the Vice President of everything in North America.
That sounds like sexual harassment.
Robby, there's a fine line between sexual harassment - and something awesome.
- I thought you hated your co-workers.
- You said they were a bunch of - Pant-suited corporate She-Hulks?
Yeah, I know what I said.
Emma is the craziest woman to ever hit on me.
Schmidt, you're such a nice guy.
- Thank you.
- What you deserve is a girl who respects you.
- You know?
A nice girl.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not into the nice thing, Robby.
Doesn't do it for me.
- Well, that's what I thought, too.
- Yeah.
You know, until I found, uh this one right here.
You mean Cece?
You think that I'm nice?
No.
I think you're the nicest.
- Mm.
- Hmm.
Robby!
Yes, the man just left.
And he turned off the gas.
Yeah, I'm refusing to pay my gas bill as a matter of principle.
You'd like me to take the survey?
Of course I'll take the survey.
- Schmidt?
- Yeah, hold on.
Can I share some thing with you, man to man?
Oh, I'm You have to promise me you will not laugh.
Look, I'm you're not talking to Nick, here.
You're talking to Schmidt.
Schmidt, I think I'm getting my period.
Okay.
This is a real thing, okay?
I looked it up on the Internet.
It's called, uh, "sympathy PMS," right?
Now, apparently this is an affliction that men suffer from all the time.
Right on.
I don't know how it happened, man, but somehow, I got on that woman's cycle of menstruation and I got that menstruation inside of me.
Winston!
Men can't get their periods.
Where would they put the tampon?
Hey!
Are you calling me stupid?
You're the one that's stupid, okay?
You jack-faced butthole!
Who's the jack-faced butthole who turned off the hot water?
!
Witch!
What have you done to my body?
Shut up, you!
Why is there no hot water?
!
Oh, I'm sorry, Jess.
If you don't pay, you don't play.
You also don't shower.
Are you serious?
- Thank you, Denise.
- Hey, hey!
Hey, great buddies.
- Ow, my skin!
- Okay.
- Roommates hey, buddy.
- Don't poke me.
Something wonderful happened to me today, and I am no longer angry.
It's gone.
Oh, shut up, Nick.
So let me get this straight: Nothing at all's going to set you off?
That's right.
Nothing's gonna get to me, 'cause it's a new Nick Miller.
Awesome.
Hey, Winston, tell him what you have.
Sympathy PMS.
It's a real thing, I looked it up.
- Sympathy PMS?
What's that?
- No!
PMS is mine!
Stop stealing my stuff, Winston.
You're telling me you're having a pre-menstrual something right now?
- Yes.
- Okay.
It's like a character in a Judy Blume novel.
No!
You can't have my menzies.
He's got her menzies.
No part of this conversation is making me want to boil over with rage.
I feel really good, guys.
Hey, gang, why is the water so cold?
Schmidt turned off the hot water, because it's not enough that I have to go on an interview with the red devil in my belly, I also have to go unshowered.
there's no hot water in the whole house?
Yeah.
Seems strange.
Maybe a cold shower will wake you up to some harsh financial realities, Jessica Day.
You don't control my heat, Theodore P. Gasbag.
This is good!
We got a lot of feelings going around.
A lot of anger.
And you.
You You're suddenly calm?
- Yeah.
- Really?
It feels like a fat man's sitting on my uterus.
I hear that.
Gonna go to the store!
Does anybody want anything?
!
Thank you, Denise.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
Shut the door.
Whoa.
Quick reflexes.
Good.
I am going to devour you.
- You see that contract?
- Oh, the thick one?
With all those tabbies?
Do me on it.
Pick that up.
Did you just ask me to pick it up to see me bend over?
No.
Oh, wait, I'm doing it.
Stand up.
What is this thing?
You're gonna have to sign it before anything can happen between us.
"Party A absolves Party B "of any psychological trauma, whether temporary, permanent, future or imagined".
After we do what we do, you're gonna want to talk.
I can't allow that.
The less risk I incur, the more I can focus on creating a viable sexual experience for both of us.
You're gonna want to sign it.
"Possible exposure to lead paint".
Do I have a latex allergy?
That's very important.
"Guaranteed mercury poisoning"?
Mm.
Is this real?
You have till week's end to sign it.
What is your name?
!
I can't keep thinking of you as my magical best friend with no name.
Joe.
Tommy.
Louis.
Tran.
Is it Tran?
What a crazy guess!
Beautiful name.
Fits you perfectly.
My roommates are killing me.
Fine, you're right.
Okay, I like them, all right?
I hate myself.
Is that what you want me to say?
Why do you always have to make everything so simple?
!
How do you just get it?
How do I become you?
Show me the way, man.
I'll do anything.
All right, man, I'm in.
You lead, my man.
All right, whatever is about to happen's gonna happen.
Jessica Day?
So why do you want to teach adults?
I think it's really inspiring that these people have chosen to go back to school, you know, that they want to read To Kill A Mockingbird, - that they want - Oh!
I named my dog Boo after After Boo Radley?
- Exactly.
- That's amazing.
Oh, my God.
She was a puppy.
She's so cute.
I know.
Such a cutie.
This cup is so tiny.
So cute.
Sorry, how did she fit in the cup?
I just don't understand.
Just physically, how did she get so small?
I'm sorry, um I'm sorry, I got this I don't know what's wrong.
So weird.
Never happens to me.
She's really cute.
Yes, she was.
Did she die?
It's fine.
It's been two years.
Puppy in a cup.
So we're both dog people, right?
Schmidt, am I nice?
- No.
- Thank you.
Nobody thinks I'm a nice girl, okay?
I'm the mistake.
Ah, Robby.
Midwestern heart, Midwestern body.
I'm the one who messes things up.
I agree with you.
I feel like he doesn't even know me.
You're getting your smell all over the comforter.
Oh, my God.
Took me months to get rid of that heavenly curry smell.
What happens when he realizes he was wrong about me the entire time?
He's just gonna run away.
I would, I would never run away from you.
But if I did, I would run way faster than Robby.
'Cause he's slow.
And I'm fast.
Maybe I'm just not meant for a functional relationship.
You know me, Schmidt.
You don't ever have to be nice around me.
I'm not scared of you.
I mean, I'm bad.
I do I do bad things.
I don't think you're a nice girl.
Think you're the worst.
No.
No?
No.
I can't do this to Robby.
But you're a bad person.
We discussed that.
- You're a bad person, I'm a bad person.
- Yep.
We can totally do this.
No qualms.
- I have a qualm.
I have a qualm.
- You don't have a qualm.
We sold our qualms, and we used the profits to buy perfect bodies.
- Robby is right.
- Hmm.
- I'm nice.
- I'm not nice, all right?
And I like Robby, but that is doing nothing right now from stopping me from wanting to kiss you.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
But I-I don't want to stop.
I really don't.
I will never stop wanting to kiss you.
I am a monster.
I got to go.
Yeah, sure.
Have fun.
Thank you.
I really needed this.
Mm-hmm.
And I I'm a monster.
Okay.
What is this place?
What are you?
What would you like?
What does this mean?
Let's not do this.
Let's not take off our clothes.
Let's go back to the park where it was good What do I know?
We're taking our pants off?
Okay.
Keep those underwear on, am I right?
Yeah.
Stay on.
Underwear good.
Why are you cradling me like a baby, friend?
This is not how guys of my generation hang out.
This is a moment that got away from me, man.
Oh, that's my butt.
This is intimate.
How did you know?
You are a huge baby.
Yeah, I am.
I am a huge baby.
Forget it, I'm done.
I'm not getting a teaching job.
- Mm.
- Just can't go back out there, you know?
Oh, I feel you, Jess.
I took a sick day.
I just stayed at home and did a watercolor of mountains.
So you gonna get this, like, every month?
I mean, it's a possibility from all the information that I've read on the Internet.
That women like you - are the alpha.
- What?
You're like the powerful moon, and all the women in your life are just latched on to your cycle.
In my case, grown-ass man.
Oh, yeah, good news.
The gang's all here.
Guys just PMS-ing?
Not in the mood today.
Don't really feel like being yelled at, so what I'm gonna do is go ahead and leave, because right now I'm feeling very fragile.
I understand.
What's wrong with you?
I'm no longer angry!
All the anger that used to be inside of me is gone!
It's gone, it's gone!
This is the worst thing I've ever seen.
- What is wrong with you?
- No.
Period's got you down?
That is such a raw deal.
Want me to get you a sanitary napkin?
Ew!
Okay, I won't get that.
But you're okay with pads or tampons or whatever it is that you're using?
Tell me about your day, please.
I want to get into your universe.
Let's rap it out.
Go.
Floor is yours, pal.
Talk, talk, talk.
I want to listen.
- No.
- 30 seconds of direct eye contact?
Stop it, Nick.
Please, stop.
In three seconds, I'll be silent.
One, two I bombed all my interviews.
What?
What happened?
I was sabotaged by my baby box, which means I'm never gonna trust anything that comes out of it.
So that rules out a family.
I know just the thing you need.
Come with me.
Welcome to the wonderful world of water massage.
You are a piece of seaweed.
You are totally happy.
Ow!
- I don't mean to touch your boobs!
- You're touching my boobs!
I don't mean to touch your boobs!
Fail, fail, fail.
The next move is Oh, my!
Relaxing is important.
Relaxing is important.
Relax!
Oh, no.
What are you trying to do?
!
Kill me?
!
It worked for me.
I was trying to help you.
I've been watching you doubt yourself for months.
I'm not doubting myself.
You're doubting yourself, Jess.
No, Nick, it's PMS.
It's not PMS.
You got knocked down.
It's time to get back up.
And get up long enough for one of these bozos to hire you.
I believe in you.
So does that guy.
Hey.
Think you can do that?
And if you don't, I'm gonna water massage you again.
- Can you do that?
- Yes.
Can you do that?
Yes!
Jessica Day?
- Yes, I'm here.
- Weren't you here the other day?
Weren't you here the other day?
Yes, I was.
Well, I signed it.
Please note the added provision.
In any autobiographical account of my life, you want to be referred to as Moises Perdue.
Non-negotiable.
But you're fine with the rest of it?
Look, I'm a depraved freak, and I want to wander into your Narnia of sexual terror and emerge like a freshly birthed calf.
Put your hands out.
Let's do this.
Are you ready?
I'm ready.
All right.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Interesting technique.
Hold tight.
I mean, I could totally get out of this.
What, have you never bound somebody before?
I got to start over.
This your first time?
Are you rejecting me?
No, I-- no.
I mean Because legally you can't.
Now take off your pants.
Okay.
Now.
All right, all right.
I got it.
I got it.
Right there.
Oh.
No, I got it.
Hold on, I got it.
I did it.
I did it.
Ladies and gentlemen, drumroll please.
Cut!
Cut, Nick!
Snare drum.
I shouldn't have to specify.
- Jess, that was a cymbal.
- Cymbals are part of the drum kit.
Yeah.
Nevertheless, we are gathered here today to celebrate the reemployment of Jessica F. Day.
- Not my middle initial.
- Who will once again be in the classroom, molding the minds of children.
Actually, I'm gonna be remolding the minds of grown-ups, 'cause I'm gonna be teaching creative writing to adults.
So, what, are you gonna be, like, reading a bunch of weirdos' writing?
Well, I hope you like stories about vampires - and bad childhoods.
- I do.
- You're gonna get them.
- In any case, I think I speak for all of us when I say that we are thrilled that you will once again have a reason to shower daily.
Yes.
Now, let there be gas.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Ah, yeah!
- Gonna be hot water in six to ten minutes, fool!
What?
!
- Yeah!
Schmidt!
Schmidt!

Sleepy eyes.
Hey.
What's going on, man?
I don't really have PMS.
I know.
You're a man.
I miss Shelby.
This is all about your breakup?
I know just the thing you need.
Oh, no.
Just relax and breathe.
I'll take your shoulders.
I'll take your feet.
This is really weird, man.
Really weird.
Cool vibe, man.
What are you guys doing now?
What have I gotten myself into?
Hey, lady, crushing that flute, babe.
And breathe.
Okay, I'm trying.
I'm gonna do that.
Whoa.
Just chill out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing with my legs?
No!
Come on!
Come on, chill out!
Nick, what are you doing, man?
!
Reset.
Let's reset.
This is weird!
No!
No!
No!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Jess, I'm not done with that.
That's $18 granola-- handmade.
$18 for granola?
Okay, you're gonna be eating two Thanksgiving meals today, so starve yourself.
Jess, I get it that your parents are divorced, but can't they just have one meal together?
Yeah, sure, they can if they're both gagged and blindfolded.
Okay, listen up, guys, my mom is gonna be here at 9:00 and she's staying till 2:00, and then my dad's going to be here at 2:30 and he's gonna stay till 7:30.
I should also warn you guys - that my mom's a little bit perky.
- Wait, you think she's perky?
Well, she doesn't have my dark side.
I got that from my dad.
Nick, you're gonna love my dad so much.
He's so unhappy.
I'm not into dads, I'm not a dad guy.
I don't like 'em, don't trust 'em, never have.
Oh, that's her.
It's okay, man.
What's okay, man?
- Oh.
- Momsicle.
Oh, Jujube.
Wow, showed up looking like a pilgrim.
- Every year.
- Hello, everyone.
- This is my mom Joan.
- Hi.
- This is everybody.
- Hi.
Oh, come on over, I just want to give you all a big hug.
- Oh, come on, big Thanksgiving hug.
- Do it, come on.
Come on, we'll do a big hug ball, come on.
- Come on, Cece, you know how to do this.
- Yep.
You in the white shirt.
I don't do hug balls.
Come on in.
Hug ball jumping, hug ball jumping.
Okay.
- All right.
- Whoo!
Oh, dear God.
- A hug ball?
- Dad.
- Well, hello, Bob.
- You're early.
You know what I'm thankful for today?
Divorce.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
No, no, no, no, it was my mistake, it's my mistake.
I'll wait five hours and come back when Joan's shift is up.
Bob, just stay.
What if we need something ruined?
- Mom!
- It's all right, I'll spend my holiday at a Los Angeles coffee shop - No - sitting around with people who have nothing better to do on Thanksgiving than work on their screenplay.
I probably won't want to blow my head off.
Bob, we are both grown-ups.
We can make it through one day together.
Please, Dad.
- Well done, Jessica Day.
- Pardon?
"My mom's coming at 9:00 a.m. and my dad's coming at 2:30".
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The movie you made me watch a million times.
- Rocky IV?
- Parent Trap.
What?
I don't Mm-hmm.
Why would I do that?
Parent Trap-- crazy.
Mom, Dad, help, there's a man in the room.
He's trying to get us to eat candy.
Jess, Jess.
Jess?
Jess, are you okay?
What's the matter?
Are you?
Oh, damn it, Jess, that's the second time today.
Smile, Mom, you still got it.
Jessica, what are you doing?
I want him to see what he's missing.
You're texting your father?
!
That was a long time ago, Cece, when I was young and naive.
- Just go.
- Excuse me.
What's with all the crappy beer, man?
You hate that stuff.
Let's just say that my cousin doesn't exactly have the most sophisticated palate.
Raised by wolf-like parents in the wilds of Minnesota, he actually went to juvie for stealing the synagogue's minivan.
It's been that way since we were kids.
Made my life a living hell.
I'm the strong kind of fat.
Yes, yes, yes!
Please tell me he's going to sit on you when he gets here.
He's a good guy, I'm telling you, he's totally changed.
- Okay.
- He settled down with this great woman named Krista.
She's coming.
Actually went Legoltod with them last year.
He didn't pressure me to go on any of the rides I wasn't comfortable with.
Ho!
Ha-ha.
How you doing, little buddy?
Come here.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Okay.
- Hey.
- What's up, man?
Winston.
Nice to meet you, I'm Schmidt.
I actually go by Schmidt, uh, around here.
There can only be one-- you know the rule.
- Ah!
Look at that right there.
- That's Where's Krista?
Krista and I have a new arrangement.
Okay.
- I, uh, I can sleep with whoever I want, but she doesn't speak to me or live with me any more.
Hey, Dad, - you want to help us?
- I have to stay away from salmonella.
You don't have to lick it, Bob.
No, no, no, my doctor says It was a joke, it was just a joke.
I have a sense of humor.
If that was a joke, here is a pencil.
Draw me a map to the joke.
Guys, it doesn't have to be like this.
Mom.
you're in a great place with your practice.
Dad, I'm sorry Katherine cheated on you, - but it's been months.
- Jess.
- What are you?
- I'm sorry, I thought, I thought, I-- I'm s-- I thought everyone knew.
You grieved so publicly on Instagram-- all those pictures of sad trees and, and your lunches.
Katherine cheated?
Yeah.
Oh, Bob, that's terrible, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- No, really, I had no idea.
Yeah, well, yeah.
Oh, sorry, really.
Come here, come here, let me Salmonella - Salmonella.
- Okay.
- I liked her.
- You did?
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.
Hey, remember that song, huh?
- Sure, Bob.
- Yeah.
- Do I remember that?
- That was the night.
- Great night.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not talking about the concert.
No, the after-- the afterparty.
- The afterparty.
- The after-- yeah.
Jess, no.
Parent trap.
Okay, admittedly this is a little bit crazy, but if this is going to work, you're both helping me.
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- Sit down, sit down.
- I'm not doing a parent trap.
- Nick, they got married too young, they got divorced too young.
I think this could really make them happy.
They need us.
Here's the plan: We're gonna make my mom look so hot that my dad can't resist her.
Your parent trap-- there's no identical twins or mistaken identity?
Not a parent trap, it's a makeover.
The only thing you have to do is distract my dad.
A parent trap takes weeks of scheduling.
I feel like you're just throwing this together.
This is a makeshift parent trap; - They don't work.
- Why do you have to ruin everything, Nick?
I don't know, I've got something bad inside of me.
I ruin things.
Let's do this parent trap.
Yes.
Oh, would you look at that?
She's spectacular.
Wow.
Well, you know, we used to date, right?
You, Schmiggle?
- Schmidt.
- Please.
Cece, can you please come over here and confirm our intercourse?
And then I dumped her 'cause I was like, you know, whatever.
You mean, you ran away scared.
Exactly, you're not enough man for a woman like that.
- Okay, yeah, and you are?
- Damn right I am.
Well, I'll tell you what, if you guys want to find out who's truly the manliest, you should have a contest.
- I'm listening.
- Go on.
- The winner of this contest will be declared the one true Schmidt.
- Yes.
- It is on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm bored.
- Nice.
Seems like every time they want to move a team to Los Angeles, the team that's most likely to move here, the owner Al Davis Dead.
And then they talk to the, to the Ravens and their owner Art Modell-- dead.
Dead.
You know what I mean?
Who-Who's going to speak out for us, - I mean, the voice of the NFL-- Steve Sabol?
Dead.
- Also dead.
- Exactly.
You know, it doesn't take a genius.
All you got to do is - follow the money.
- Always follow the money.
That's what I always say.
- You always follow the money.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oil companies.
- Pharmaceuticals.
Big business, chicken corporations.
Corn.
Yeah.
Just explain to me again why we're doing this.
Because, when Cece's all washed up as a model, she wants to be a makeup artist.
And I want to help her realize her dreams.
Yeah, it's my plan B. Okay, stop.
Seriously, it's just too much.
The makeup and-and your dress?
The only reason I wear makeup in Portland is to keep the rain off my face.
So your hair just does, like, this one thing, right?
Sorry.
I don't know if Jess has told you this, but I am writing a novel.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- What's it about?
It's about zombies.
Zombies?
And it's a relationship story.
It has a great love story in there that could be made into a movie, I think.
The love story's between whom?
The zombie and Carol.
Zombie and the-the Carol is not a zombie?
- She's a regular person?
- No, she's a rich girl.
Oh, so it's like the Twilight thing where It's not like the Twilight No, it isn't.
Where the vampire falls in love with a regular person.
You don't really you don't get it.
- It's the same thing.
- Oh, really?
Is there another guy on Twilight, that there's a bit of a love triangle with?
Yes.
- It's the same as Twilight - Does Twilight have a wolf in it?
- Yes.
- It does?
Yes.
Is Twilight in Seattle?
Yes!
Well, then whoever wrote that is smart.
Um, listen, I know you were very young, and I'll completely forgive you, just tell me the truth-- Did you drive my van?
Joan, I have told you this.
It wasn't me.
Okay, I believe you.
I know it was you.
Wow, I look like a slutty Katie Couric.
The trap has been set.
- Is is working?
- Mm-hmm.
Croce makes my mom frisky.
Check it out.
Oh, hey, your mom looks great.
Really?
- Go hit on her.
- What?
My dad gets super jealous.
So if you go lay some sweet game on her - Go hit on your mother?
- I was going to make Schmidt do it.
No, no, no, I can't hit on - Hey, Mom.
Mom, uh, - Jess Nick was just saying that your dÃ©colletage looks bewitching in that dress.
- Right, Nick?
- Thank you.
I like your de, uh your de de-college.
Say hello to my sister wives, Mrs. Schmidt and Mrs. Schmidt.
- All right, time for delts?
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm slowly regretting this.
Definition is for chicks, man.
All right, it's all about size.
I mean, look at the mass on this bitch.
- Stupid.
- What's your calf situation like?
Calves?
Want to see some ankle circles?
Look at that.
Some donkey raises?
One, two No, no, no, no, no.
Wheelbarrow.
- What's a wheelbarrow?
- Wheelbarrow.
Every kid knows what a wheelbarrow is.
Put your hands on the ground.
Hand on the ground.
Hey!
All right.
- Turn him around.
Faster.
- Yeah, all right.
Come on, man, really work those calves.
Look at this, Winston, I can do this all day, man.
No, I got it all day, man.
All day, I don't even think about it.
That's awesome.
Keep going.
- All day.
I can do this all day, Winston.
- I got all day, too!
Hey, how long can you do this for?
I can do this all day!
- Yeah, I got all day, too!
- Winston!
Why are you yelling at me?
I'll do this all day!
I'll do it all day, Winston!
- This is great.
- I'll do it all day, Winston!
Joan, I've got to say you are great at doing what you're doing.
You got those beautiful strong arms.
- You want to give it a try?
- Okay.
Mom and Nick seem to be really getting along great.
- Well, no, no, no - Is that good?
- You're wasting it.
- Oh, sorry, then show me.
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, we got to get the whole thing.
There you go.
What is happening?
I can feel the chemistry from here.
I sprayed all over.
Clean up time.
Like, whoa.
Jess, what are you doing?
Watching the game.
You're doing the parent trap thing again.
- What?
Dad - Yes.
I have a master's degree.
I'm not parent trapping.
- You're such a liar.
- Seriously, I'm not Okay.
Fine, you're right.
- You need help.
- Why do I do that?
I don't understand.
Every time, it never worked out.
Okay, I'm calling it off.
Nick.
Every time I try to tell you The words just come out wrong Nick!
So I have to say "I love you" In a song.
- Nick!
- I love that.
Nick!
Thanks for helping me out, but I'm calling it off.
She's doing another one of her parent traps.
- Can I top you off?
- Yes, please.
Hey, Nick, what are you doing?
I don't know, Jessica.
I'm a little bit confused.
I think I'm into your mother.
- What?
!
- I don't know how it happened.
In truth, it happens all the time, Nick.
I don't know if it's the sweet sounds of Jimmy Croce or the sweet smells of this turkey Nick, this is not what we talked about.
- I know but it got - Give me that baster.
- No!
Okay, everyone.
This bird needs to go back in the oven.
Bob, I need to clean you up in the bathroom please.
- Come on.
- Brand-new shirt.
Do I regret it?
Yes.
Would I do it again?
Probably.
It's all right, Joan, you don't have to do it.
You want, you can go back to your basting.
What, did you get a little jealous, Bob?
Of that idiot?
What, are you kidding me?
You know, she's really got to stop doing this.
She's so stubborn.
Wonder where she got that?
Did she ever text you some photos?
- You mean of you in the shower?
- Yeah.
- I got 'em.
- I was just wondering.
Eh, maybe I was a little jealous.
Seems to me like this whole thing is a draw.
I mean, You did touch a hotter pan, but he ate a much bigger candle.
You belched longer, he farted louder.
You punched a tree, he head-butted a bench.
You both bailed on the fifth testicle punch.
I mean, Schmidt, how much more can you take?
Schmiggle, I got the belts rigged up in the bedroom.
Ready to see who blacks out first?
All right, you know what, forget it.
Whatever, I-I give.
- Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow.
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
Yeah, but know this, all right.
Your caveman ideas about manhood are so over.
Manhood today is about exfoliation, - Ha!
- And cheese courses, and emotional honesty, and Paxil.
And yes, cutting peppers in the classic style de julienne.
You may have bested me in a competition of pre-Clinton manhood, but I am Schmidt.
A refined and enlightened pescetarian.
About 90% of the time.
Observe.
What are you doing?
Don't touch the blade-- it's hot.
A classic julienne.
Marine Corps Cook of the Year 2003.
And I can do the same thing to a man's arm.
Yeah, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
That's the sound of round two.
Perfection.
This is a masterpiece right here.
- Who's hungry, right?
- I am starving.
Well, it makes sense with you two.
You guys must've worked up an appetite.
What?
Look at that plating.
It's like Picasso.
It's nice squeeze bottle work there, Bobby Flay.
- He is still relevant.
- Where?
Phoenix?
Schmidt, come on, we are getting hungry.
What don't you guys just stay here?
- I'll sleep on the couch.
- What?
What are you saying?
- What?
- Nothing happened.
What are you saying?
What are you saying?
- I'm with you.
- You shouldn't be saying anything - Anything, - 'cause I don't know anything.
'Cause you're not you don't have any information - about anything.
- Information at all.
Nothing.
- Happened.
- The answer is nothing.
- What?
- Answer me a question.
Which one of these platings is more masculine?
Look, do you guys want to know what the ultimate test is?
Being secure in your masculinity.
- How do we prove that?
- I'm super secure.
You kiss a man.
Yeah.
If you want to be the one true Schmidt.
I mean - No.
We don't.
- I'll kiss a man.
I'll kiss a man.
Yeah, I'll kiss a man.
- Winston.
Yeah, he'd do.
- Winston?
I could go for some stuffing right now.
Am I right?
- Yeah, love me some stuffing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, right?
- Yeah, let's go.
- I'll kiss Winston.
- I'll do it.
- I'll kiss Winston all day.
I'll kiss Winston's mouth all day.
Let's do it.
All day I'll kiss Winston Everybody else really hot, too?
- Oh, wow.
- Hey.
Ooh!
Thank you.
- Manly.
- Beautiful.
Hey, Winston, uh, I got you this as an after-dinner mint for after dinner.
- Oh, thanks, man.
I appreciate it.
- Okay?
For you to have.
- I appreciate that.
- Just make sure you take that's right What are we having here, turkey sushi?
What is this?
Ooh.
I'm gonna make a toast.
Parent Trap's just a movie.
And real relationships are not like that.
They're more complicated than that.
And they're not even real twins.
Twins!
Yes!
I'm thankful for twins.
They're like sisters, but they do it, and they like to have sex.
- Schmidts.
- What?
!
- What?
- In conclusion I want to say what I'm thankful for.
Family.
They said it couldn't be done.
They said, "You're crazy, Jess".
I am so thankful today that I proved them wrong.
- Whoa, honey, what?
- Whoa, hey, hey, wait.
What are you saying?
Congratulations, guys.
We saw you guys doing it - in the bathroom.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- We saw you guys doing it in the bathroom.
- It was the greatest day - of my entire life.
- Greatest day of mine.
There was so much love there.
And sex.
Sex energy, too, Jess.
And se-sex.
You lit this place on fire, - you two animals.
- It was just a kiss.
It was a great kiss.
It was a hookup.
It mean nothing.
Listen, if Joanie's up for grabs, - I volunteer.
- I volunteer, too.
- I volunteered first.
- Don't even matter.
- You can't volunteer right after - I'm in the game now.
You just wanted me for my body.
- Yup.
- And I'm fine with that.
- Joanie, what if it was like that?
- That's not bad.
I saw something.
You guys had a spark, you connected.
Let's get natural.
Bring it to you.
I swear, if you got together today, it would be different than before.
I think you could make each other happy.
I'm serious.
No.
What?
Let me finish.
Jess, you got to let it go, okay?
No, I'm not letting it go!
- You have to admit that - No.
- What?
- they're never gonna make it work.
- No.
- And you scratched my van.
Mom, she didn't mean to scratch your van.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Didn't I tell you?
I knew it.
Okay, the reason I was in your van is because your little JuJuBe was high as a kite!
Oh.
Oh, my God.
Honey, are you an addict?
Oh, this is new information.
It was a brownie.
I wasn't allowed to eat chocolate.
Yes.
What, are you living with drug dealers?
When can we start eating?
- Are you into pot?
Is this a rehab?
- What are you doing?
Are you selling your body to pay for the rent?
I don't sell my body for rent, no!
When can we start eating?
It's off.
Off.
Shut up, everybody!
I just want to be a family.
Jess.
You have a family.
Your father and I are not getting back together.
Never.
Jess.
- Honey?
- Where you going?
Jess?
Turkey.
Jess.
Honey, can I come in?
Or do you have your dad hiding in the closet, waiting to make out with me?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I ruined the whole day, and it could have been really nice, but it wasn't, 'cause I tried to shove a turkey down a garbage disposal.
I just I thought maybe you guys could make each other happy.
We're actually happier apart.
Maybe I just worried that since you guys are alone that means that I have to end up alone.
You're not gonna be alone.
Even if you were, you could always move in with me.
We could get a condo in Miami.
Mm.
And start solving crimes together.
God, you have to lighten up, Jess.
It's just life.
Yeah, you know what?
We could definitely Grey Gardens the crap out of a condo in Miami.
Can't wait to eat cat food with you.
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.
And so is your dad.
Okay.
We doing this or not?
I'm going in.
Mmm.
Mmm.
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?
No.
Face smells like a dude's face.
- Not for me.
- Hmm.
All right.
Watch how a real man does it.
Hey, Winston?
'Sup?
- Yeah.
- I know, right?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Okay, well, then it's off.
Game over.
No.
No way.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
All day!
Whoa!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
I did it.
And I'm the one true Schmidt!
You got it, man.
You can be Schmidt.
I'm You should not do that on Thanksgiving.
I kissed a dude!
Oh, I miss Krista.
You know, she had a little mustache, too?
I know she did.
You okay Schmidt?
Yes I am Schmidt.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Give me a hug.
I love you, sweetie.
Love you.
Love you, sweetheart.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you, too, sweetheart.
Joan, I just want to say that I'm really happy that, you know, we got past all that.
Come here, Cece.
Give my little girl drugs again-- I will end you.
Bye.
Bye, everybody.
- And no more parent traps.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're done with those.
- Got it.
- Been there, trapped that.
- Bye.
- Love you guys.
Bye.
I won't tell her if you don't.
Tell her about what?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
To my dear friends, Melissa and Sadie.
- Aw.
- Five years together.
- That is awesome.
- Hear, hear.
- What is your secret?
- I don't really think there is a secret.
I think it's just about love, understanding, and two sets of boobs.
I love boobs.
I love 'em.
- I love - Okay - everything about 'em.
- Yeah, I do, too.
All different kinds.
Yeah, that's my thing too.
I love them.
And the Curiosity Rover has touched down - on the planet of Mars.
- What's happening right now?
What's happening in there?
Schmidt's in there with his boss.
He's entertaining her.
Ew.
I don't care what he does.
I just don't understand why he has to narrate it!
Robot arm engaged!
It's just engaged now?
So he's saying everything up to this point has been foreplay?
Are you kidding me?
That's ridiculous.
What are you gonna do for 20 minutes of foreplay?
Boring!
Yawn!
Am I right, ladies?
So, I actually know what's about to happen next.
- You will all want to cover your ears.
- I found water!
- No, I didn't do it in time.
- Oh, he found Has anybody seen a movie in the last five months, and can you describe the plot in great detail and loudly?
- Okay, you're dry.
- Actually, I'm good.
Thank you.
Come on.
I spent six dollars on this wine.
I've been looking for the right time to tell you tonight, but Melissa and I are so excited because Wow.
That is so upsetting.
What mission is this based on?
!
I'm pregnant!
We are pregnant!
Wha?
Lesbian baby.
Congratulations, you guys.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
I feel so lucky, you know?
Like I really tucked this one in just under the wire.
What do you mean?
You're so young.
As your friendly neighborhood gynecologist, you should know that by the time a lady hits 30, she loses about - What?
No, th-that - can't be true.
- What?
Did you know that there's a test that you can take that tells you how many beans - you got left in your bean sack?
- Ovaries.
It estimates basically how many childbearing years you have left.
Yeah, get this baloney: I'm 32, but my eggs are 48, and my vagina is 97.
- I am so uncomfortable.
- But it gets better with age-- it's like - the vagina Helen Mirren.
- Oh, boy.
I've got big plans for the centennial.
When can I take that test?
Who cares?
Personally, I'm still on the please-God-I-hope- I'm-not-pregnant phase.
- What am I doing here?
- You know, just clinically speaking, it's probably - a good idea to know.
- I want to take this test!
Like, now.
Can we take this test right now?
Morning, ladies.
And Nick.
- Morning?
- Well, I mean, I work nights now, so I'm on an adjusted sleeping schedule.
I just woke up, here's my breakfast, I'm going to work.
Take me with you!
They're talking about vaginas!
I hate it!
Take me with you!
Our bodies really made something.
I feel like we brought manufacturing jobs - back to America.
- Yeah, it was fine.
What do you mean "fine"?
I broke your brain, girl.
How do I put this delicately?
I was nowhere close to finishing.
I was bored.
And cold.
That's cool.
Uh No, yeah.
World shattered.
We'll try again.
It'll be better.
The world I once lived in shattered.
All right, see you at work.
See you at work.
Put me on the air.
I got something to say about Andrew Bynum's hair.
All right, caller, you're up next.
Look at you, man.
This is great.
You're the king of your own castle.
Look at this.
What is this?
Why do you need so many pens, you big shot?
I like what I do, man.
I finally feel like my life is moving in the right direction.
That is what I don't have in my life.
But not anymore.
I'm gonna take one of these pens, I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write my zombie novel.
You don't think I can do it, do you?
You know, it's not that.
It's just that sometimes I get the feeling that you don't want to write.
No more excuses.
I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write that novel.
And I'll be the first to read it.
- We got a deal, friend.
- Deal.
Yeah, you still have me on the line.
My two cents?
He's never gonna write that book.
- Why don't you shut up, Manny from Cerritos?
- Okay.
- Who asked you?
Hang up the phone.
- All right.
We should go.
Melissa's been drinking for two.
Three.
Awesome night, ladies.
- Educational.
Thank you.
- Sorry.
I'm just - Okay.
I'm sorry.
- What?
Sadie, before you leave, can I just ask you a few questions?
I know where this is going.
You are a gynecologist and a lesbian, which makes you well, a va-genius.
- Jar.
- I know my way around a Grizzly Adams.
You, too?
Jar.
- Wh - As an adult male, I would like to ask you a few questions about, you know, the downstairs girl cookie.
Jars, jars, all around jars!
This is my personal time right now.
You can make an appointment at my office, pay your $40 co-pay.
I will be happy to answer your questions.
Yes!
I'm in.
Please.
Now, would I have to put my legs up in the stirrups?
- Why would you?
- I'm asking more so out of curiosity - than fear.
#excitement.
- Are you done?
I'm done.
I'll see you, okay?
- I'm gonna call the office.
- Okay.
Well, thank you, guys, for the awesome drunky - thing and the weirdly sobering end.
- Look, I know Sadie freaked you out with all this talk about tests, but I just want to remind you that at the end of the day, it's all about love.
I mean, I love Sadie.
I want my babies to have her beautiful face.
As long as they don't get her big, fat man-feet.
Yuck.
Fingers crossed we go donor on that one.
Okay.
- Let's make a graceful exit, my love.
- Okay.
Hey, get out of here, you crazy lesbos, with your baby-making!
- Ooh!
- Whoo!
Ah!
I'm married; I'm not dead!
See you.
Night.
Drive safely.
That's crazy.
I'm panicking.
You panicking?
God, no.
Babies wreck you, Jess.
They literally eat your body.
I'm 30, I'm single, and I just started a new job.
Tonight I used a bread roll to wipe butter off my face, and then I ate the bread roll, so I essentially used my face as a butter knife.
I don't think I'm ready to bring new life into the world, but what if all that's left are the weird eggs?
And the evil eggs?
You have no evil eggs.
I can feel them.
They're turning.
They watched their brothers and sisters die, and now they want to be birthed.
I need to be fertilized.
Fertilize me, Los Angeles!
Calm down, all right?
You're overreacting.
I am overreacting!
You know why?
Because I want a family.
I want to give my nipples a purpose.
Give my nipples a purpose!
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, God, that was a mistake.
Duck down.
That was a mistake.
We're taking that test.
Well I think that you guys made a really smart decision - coming in here today.
- Sadie, once at a senior graduation party, I sat in a very hot Jacuzzi for 12 hours.
Is there any chance that I sunny-side upped my eggs?
- No, Jess.
- Oh, between the years of 1998 and 2005, I used a lot of self-tanner.
Like, a lot.
Is that a possibility of, um - Do I Okay.
- Nope.
Here we go.
I once fell on a pommel horse I'm gonna call you when I get the results.
This is good.
I got nothing.
This is Whoa, whoa, Jess, what are you doing?
That's my ketchup collection!
This fertility Web site says I need to get rid of anything with toxins.
Did you put the microwave in the trash?
- Yes.
- Why would you do that?
Microwaves zap things!
- You can't take my microwave away!
- Zap my insides!
- It's the only thing I love!
- I can't risk it!
- It's what makes burritos delicious!
- I don't care!
You care about your burritos more than my children, Nick?
- You're putting me in a tough spot.
- Friends, I'm in a real-life sex pickle.
My inability to satisfy Emma has thoroughly rocked me.
I've tried everything.
How about now?
Hold on.
I'm Shazam-ing this song.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Guess what I'm worried about?
This sound.
You know what that sound is?
It's the sound of an empty uterus.
I don't need test results to tell me that it is The Grapes of Wrath in there.
It is 1930s Dust Bowl in there, Schmidt.
And they're all walking with limps.
I can top that easily.
I'm having a hard time - with my zombie novel.
- Oh, not this Are you literally comparing a zombie novel to my ability to create life?
I'm a writer, Jess.
We create life.
Ugh!
Being a woman sucks!
Preaching to the choir.
Women are the worst.
Seriously, can you please stop yelling?
All right, now, it's no big deal, but I'm on an adjusted schedule.
Sorry about this.
Jess has absolutely lost her mind.
- I have not lost my mind!
- Yeah, you have.
I'm just scared!
Would you trust me?
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna meet somebody and you're gonna fall in love and then before you know it, you're gonna With who, Nick?
Who's gonna lay a flag down on this sweet, sweet continent?
I'll man up.
But I must warn you, Jess-- I don't have sperms.
I have tadpoles.
Of the gods.
That's right.
And I'm gonna give 'em to you.
You can have 'em all, for all I care.
That's how much I love you.
I feel your pain in this situation.
I want you to have babies.
Take my sperms.
No.
It should be me, Jess.
- What?
- With your big, beautiful blue eyes - and myBlair Underwood-like skin, - Mm-hmm.
- We'd have the most beautiful baby the world has ever seen.
- He's not wrong.
- It could get into any school it wants.
- Mm-hmm.
To be clear, I haven't asked any of you to impregnate me.
I think it's important that that's been said.
Good, 'cause it's definitely not me.
Good, 'cause it's definitely not you.
I would love that little baby with all my heart.
Even if I did show it by picking him up from school in my underwear and hitting on the crossing guard.
- How's the zombie novel coming?
Good, good, good.
I haven't written a word.
Wait, are you serious?
Nick, it's not that hard, man.
Just sit down and write.
You ain't Hemingway.
- You boys are right.
- Mm-hmm.
I got to be more like Hemingway.
I just lost another one of my eggs while you were comparing yourself to the most famous writer of all time.
Maybe the reason I have writer's block is I've been living too casual with you clowns.
I need real-life adventure like Ernest Hemingway had at my age.
Man, I got to run with the bulls.
I got to kill a man with my bare hands after making sweet love to him and then sleep on the warm belly of his horse.
I got to eat my way out of a sandwich house!
How much you know about Hemingway?
Not a lot!
But I'm gonna learn!
I'm becoming Ernest Hemingway.
You idiots.
Schmidt.
Yo.
Okay, Schmidt.
Female pleasure.
Here are some diagrams, so we can see where you're at.
The vagina.
I'm familiar.
Good.
Now, what I typically do is I start over here, and then I move here once I feel confident that this area - has been taken care of.
- Yeah, see, that's exactly what I do.
I call that "Losing Nemo".
Well, a more advanced move would be You know what?
I'll just show you.
It's sort of Come in this way.
No, no, I see what you're doing.
That asymmetry right there?
That's crucial.
'Cause then what I'll do is is I'll go outside, get the paper, and shake the neighbor's hand.
- Interesting.
- Then what I'll do is, I'll tie a bow on it because it's birthday time.
Then I get onstage and collect my Oscar and say thank you to the people, thank you to the people, then get back down offstage and get everybody into the sharing circle, right down there in the sharing circle, and then spike the volleyball.
Then what I like to do is, I like to arrive at the bridge, meet the troll, and then answer his riddles three.
Then what we do is, we're dancing.
We're just gonna dance, we're gonna dance for a while.
We'll dance until you can't dance anymore, dancing till you can't dance anymore, and then everybody gets a churro.
You okay?
Mm-hmm.
It's the baby hormones.
They are not as gay as me.
So I'm good at this, right?
Schmidt, in my professional opinion, you have definitely earned the rank of-- and I will use the phrase you coined-- va-genius.
Thank you, thank you so much.
I really needed to hear that, Sadie.
You got to go.
Hey, Winston, we're going on an adventure!
We need real-life experience like Hemingway.
Whoo, I feel like Hemingway.
This is life experience?
Yeah, the zoo is the best we can do, I told you, but it's got everything we need.
It's got life, animals, man, beast.
Look, I'm sorry, dude, it's just, you know, I'm not supposed to be awake right now - because of my adjusted - Adjusted schedule, yeah.
Hey, man, 13 minutes of sleep.
Honestly, Nick, seriously, that's all I got.
You're starting to look like a pillow to me.
All I can think of is, like, "Man, Nick looks exactly like a pillow to me".
Hmm, what'd you say?
Winston, you need some sleep.
- But I'm out here with you.
- Yeah.
- Okay, because I love you.
- Thank you.
And I want you to finish your zombie book.
Okay, but check out where we are.
This is experience, this is what's firing me up to get back to writing.
This is kind of what it's all about.
What are you doing?
It's writer's fuel.
That's what Hemingway said.
Sadie, um, hey.
Uh, I just, I just want you to know that I am, um, I'm like-- I am okay with whatever you tell me.
I'm just like, if you say you've got a year, that's fine.
If you say, like, "You can have kids till you're 80," that's fine, too.
If you say, "You are barren," um, I'm, I'm okay with that, too.
Um, just, why am I the only one talking?
Just lay it on me.
What's inside my body?
Everything looks good, Jess.
Your hormone levels are outstanding.
- What?
- Actually these are off the charts for someone your age.
I mean, I don't know how you're walking around with this many eggs.
I'm the egg queen I'm queen of the eggs.
Right.
- Cece.
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?
Maybe we should talk in private.
Cece, Cece.
Cece, wait, do you want to talk?
Jess, you don't get it.
Sadie basically just told me that if I want to have a kid, I've got to start right now.
Right now.
I thought I had all of this time.
I didn't want to have to think about this.
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I made you take the test.
What can I do?
Make me a guy so I don't have to worry about this.
You know what?
Yes.
Yeah, let's be guys just for today.
Let's, let's care about stupid things, talk about sharks and sci-fi movies and making everything wireless.
"Dude, my phone is wireless, my computer is wireless.
- Everything's wireless, yeah".
- You're a terrible guy.
"Come on".
No, I'm the best guy.
Come on, come on.
All right.
Okay, how was that?
Eh.
Why, though, with the "eh"?
Unbelie-- but I played out your most secret fantasy: French maid handyman does - Studio 54 - Studio 54 busboy.
- I know, it's disappointing.
- I thought I killed it.
And I picked you at work because I heard you were amazing in bed.
I-- no, no, no, I am, okay, I know that I am.
I have it on good authority from my model ex-girlfriend and an actual lesbian gynecologist that I know exactly what I'm doing, so it's got to be you.
It's us-- this doesn't work.
When I got divorced I-I, I thought I could go out there and have all these new experiences-- the contract of sex with someone at work who's so far beneath me, you know, someone basically just powerless.
I guess I have to feel something.
Okay, see, I'm not like that.
I don't even understand that concept.
My ex-girlfriend the model-- she's a model.
- I know she's a model.
- We'd have sex, and it was just like, I was happy, you know, I, I We were connected, I wasn't thinking about anything.
What is that?
That is love, you idiot.
That's love.
Yuck.
- It sucks.
- So, what, do I have to, I have to, like, be in love now to have good sex?
Think about me-- I got to go out in the world and meet people, date.
You're going to be great.
You think?
Yeah.
Consider our sex contract void.
How am I gonna get the feathers off?
I have no idea.
Jess and that girl!
Uh Oh, I'm so glad they're here.
So you're getting a lot of work done here, huh?
- Who wins-- me versus gorilla?
Go.
- Gorilla.
Me versus gorilla.
- Gorilla.
- No, but in a contest.
- Gorilla.
- Yeah, but in a competition.
Uh, gorilla.
You don't get it.
Okay, are you just drunk at the zoo right now?
- Let's go look at snakes.
- Okay.
Where are the snakes?
!
All day.
You know what?
I don't think we should act like the guys.
Jess, what am I going to do?
What am I going to tell Robby?
You are a Mexican West Coast rattlesnakes, and they call you "fang-tastic".
No one ever calls me anything like that.
Nick, what are you doing?
This is not life experience; This is procrastination at the zoo.
- I don't think it is.
- Now, I need some sleep.
- I got to work tonight.
- Okay, - congratulations, I'm glad you found your passion - Okay, look and that you love what you do.
- Wow.
- But enough's enough.
- Don't throw it in my face.
- Is it like that, is it like that, Nick?
- Don't throw it in my face.
- Nick, I got off - my adjusted schedule - Don't say "adjusted schedule".
- That's super annoying.
- Adjusted schedule.
- Stop saying it.
- Adjusted schedule.
You say it again, I'm gonna let the snakes out.
Adjusted schedule.
Let the snakes out.
I will let - These guys have done a pretty good job keeping it sealed.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Nick, you're not a finisher.
- Oh, I'm a finisher.
You're not a finisher at all, man.
- That's why you didn't finish law school.
- Don't do that.
The same reason you're only three episodes into Downton Abbey.
- There's just too many characters, it's hard to follow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it, man, you're scared, and that's okay-- be scared.
Just stop wasting my time because I'm tired and I need to sleep because I want to work tonight at the job I'm passionate about.
I'm glad you called me; I love the zoo.
You think I'm like a bear?
I mean, I kind of move like a bear, and I got that really long, sharp toenail that you love so much.
Hey.
Randa.
It says here you're 43.
Keeping it tight, girl.
What do you think of kids?
I love kids.
I would like to have children someday.
- Someday?
- Well, yeah, like in ten years or something.
Yeah.
I have a lot of eggs.
Unfortunately I don't have a lot of sausage.
Yeah, I shouldn't be complaining.
I'll be okay.
- Hey, Winston.
- Aah, what?
Sorry to wake you.
- Z is for Zombie.
- What?
I finished my novel.
I stayed up for 14 straight hours.
I even peed in water bottles.
We have a bathroom.
Wow, you dedicated it to me.
"To Winston.
Have a nice summer.
Hope to see you ag" Really?
I just want to say right now, the black guy dies early-- his name is William-- but don't take offense; It's a staple of the genre.
I can't take this-- too much anxiety.
I'm going to my room.
Hey, Winston, are you reading it?
Hey.
Oh, hey.
I knew it.
I knew you'd choose me to get you pregnant.
Yep, let's go.
Jess.
Schmidt.
I think I may have been in love with Cece.
- You are in love with Cece.
- You think?
Can't believe I have to have feelings to have good sex.
I was hoping I'd be dead before this happened.
Hey, why are we all hanging out in my room and sitting on my bed?
Nick, this is the worst thing I have ever read in my entire life.
You misspelled the word "rhythm" - Z is for Zombie?
- Yeah, Z Is for Zombie.
- The zombie novel.
- Yeah.
"Rhythm" is a tough word.
- Don't feel bad about that.
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Did you get to the word search?
- Yeah.
I put a word search in the novel, but the joke's on you.
There aren't any words in there, so you're just gonna be staring at letters, you idiot.
But you know what?
You finished it, and for that, my friend, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, I did finish it, I finished something.
- Yeah, you finished something.
Read it out loud, Winston.
Read it out loud.
Read it out loud.
- Read it out loud - Okay, I'll read this damn thing; you asked for it.
This might be humiliating.
"No one in the sleepy mountain town of 'Writhe-em' City" That's Rhythm City.
"knew what the meteor meant, but the one thing Mike Jr. did have was a whole lot of 'rittems.
'" - Rhythm.
- No, yeah.
- "'Whoa, what bit me in the face?
' Mike Jr. said to his dad Mike Sr., who sucks".
Sucks-- Mike Sr. sucks.
It's a major theme throughout this.
"Mike Sr. sucks a whole bunch, much more than his neighbor Rallo".
Never stop reading this.
"'Zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo, zombie zoo.
"'Who let them zombies out that damn zombie zoo?
Uh-oh, watch your back, Laura.
'" And I guess Laura is another character that he introduces, but that's it.
And here's the word search.
Yeah, good luck, you idiot.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I can't believe they're playing these old matches.
- Man, these were legendary.
- Camel clutch!
That's not a camel clutch.
That is a camel clutch.
Gentlemen, hi.
I'd just like a moment of your time.
- Jess, you can't turn that off.
- If I may.
I have a word that's gonna change your life.
The answer is already "no".
- Bathtub.
- Bathtub's two words.
- It's one word.
- Bathtub is two words.
How come I'm James Brown?
When you don't smile for my pictures, you get replaced.
You come home after a long, hard day at work.
- Tired.
- You want to relax, but how?
How about soaking in a glorious bubbly pool for one?
Sipping the nectar of the gods.
I don't get it-- is this bath water?
Might as well be; It's rosÃ©.
Burn notice, France.
- Now that I'm working again, - Don't do this.
I'd really love to come home and soak in a beautiful bathtub.
Bathtubs are Medieval filth cauldrons-- pass.
Yeah, it's a waste of money, Jess.
I'm not interested in simmering in testicle tea for 20 minutes.
Loft vote.
- No.
- No.
Feel like I'm at a garden party, haven't even left home.
Winston, what are you talking about-- loft vote, no.
What, yeah, no, duh, of course.
- Okay, you know what-- loft vote - Nay.
- Loft vote.
- Nay.
Loft vote, I'm turning wrestling back on.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Camel clutch!
Camel clutch!
- No.
Who's that girl?
who's that girl?
it's Jess.
Hey, Schmidt.
- Ooh, hey.
- Want to pitch on the new Double V campaign?
I'm all about the Double V-- what is that?
It's a new vodka, yeah.
Filled with vitamins-- Double V?
What do you think?
You know, I've never been considered to run an account before.
Wait a min Wait, is this just is this because we used to bingity-bangity?
No, of course not.
Take a look at the specs and come into my office tomorrow in your best suit, and, uh, blow me away with your take.
My best suit-- I can put on my best suit.
Okay.
Wasted project, Nick, huh?
Herringbone?
!
How did you get in here?
To schmidt.
Sleeping his way to the top.
Cheers to me.
I hope you like it.
I poured that one for you.
Drink it up.
This is coming off weird-- it's creepy, right?
- Go get her.
- I can't do that.
- I can't talk to thirsty.
- Thirsty?
I don't know her name, so I call her Thirsty.
- Thirsty Mendelson.
- Oh, you made her Jewish?
- I didn't make her Jewish.
- Mendelson?
She's not Jewish?
- Well, Thirsty.
- If her last name's Mendelson, she's Jewish.
Tell you what her first name is, too-- It's Rachel.
Get out of my head-- you're kind of ruining my thing right now.
What I have with thirsty is perfect.
She's surly like I'm surly, and she rolls her eyes at everybody like I roll my eyes at everybody.
She likes to drink in the afternoon.
And I like to drink in the afternoon.
- Go talk to her.
- No, I can't.
That breaks the first rule of bartending-- never cross the bar.
'Cause once you cross the bar, it gets messy.
Rudy just wants her $200 back.
Come on, neither of you has the right bra for this.
Excuse me, have you seen Rhonda?
Have you seen the ferret lady?
Why am I doing this?
!
Never cross the bar.
Your rules have gotten you so far.
- Classic Nick Miller.
- You got it.
Jess.
You want to help me at the jukebox really quick?
Oh, my God, yes-- I've always wanted to do this with you.
Well, I was gonna go "Raspberry Beret," but If we're gonna go Prince, I think we should go, like-- Jess, I want to talk to you about your bathtub pitch.
I love baths-- I do.
Back in Latvia, we had a great tub.
But I tell you what-- there are parts of my butt only a tub can clean.
Ew, but okay!
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, so the guys don't know.
We're gonna split the 400 bucks for the tub.
Then we can hide it on the roof and install it in the middle of the night, and then we can just pretend like you did it without our permission.
Or we could just say that you wanted a tub, too.
How about we just keep this a Jess and Winston thing?
- Hey, Cece, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good; Just broke up with Robby.
I'll make you a drink.
- What ha what happened?
- Um, I told him I had to start getting serious about having kids and he said, "Okay, that's cool".
But then that's all he said for the next eight hours, and he hasn't said anything to me since.
So terrible.
I just, I can't even - Mm-hmm.
- Wow.
I mean that's but I mean There's cool.
It's cool.
- 'Cause you're single.
You're single.
- Really subtle stuff.
- She's single now; technically, you're single are you not single?
- Schmidt!
I have to get serious about my future, otherwise my mom is going to set me up with a hundred sweet, gentle, painfully boring Indian guys.
Oh, my God, your mother.
I want to control your life.
That's how my parents met and they had a beautiful, healthy marriage.
I respect your parents-- I do.
I respect everything that-- look what they've created.
Look at that look at your beauty, with your hair.
I'd eat it out of a bowl, your hair.
I'd put it in a bowl and I'd eat your hair.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Cece.
I-I know it's unexpected that I'm here.
It's because I wanted to tell you something.
You're my boo.
You're my boo and I'm and I'm I been missing you.
I been missing you oh, so long.
You know what's weird?
I don't find this weird anymore.
What's your problem, Nick-- how long you been standing there?
How much of that did you hear?
I'm in love, man.
I'm in love with Cece.
Everyone knows that, you dumb-ass.
- You always have been.
- I gotta tell her, man.
You should do that, Schmidty, that sounds great.
- Do I have your blessing?
- Do you have my blessing?
Yeah.
I don't think you need my blessing, big guy.
- Just kind of do your thing.
- I would like your blessing.
You're my best friend.
- I want your blessing.
- Schmidt, fine, you got my blessing, okay?
Just What is this?
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.
I need this.
Come on, please, give me, give me a hug, Nick.
Please, just give me a hug!
I want-- Ow!
Good stuff.
- Thank you, Nick.
- Come on!
All right, looks good-- no leaks.
We did it.
Yeah, we did.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
It's flooding!
- Do something!
- No, no, no, no, no!
I've never wished I was dead more.
Schmidt's gonna freak out.
He once told me he spent $300 on a pocket square.
No!
Am I overreacting?
Eh, that's about right.
There you go good as new.
So, I've, uh, handled this one-man job, any two-man jobs you want us to tackle?
I think we're good.
Thanks, Remy.
You sure there's not something else that needs fixing?
Maybe in the lady's bedroom?
Uh, yeah, I think we're done-- thank you, Remy.
I will return your ladder when I feel like it.
Thank you, bye.
He's so weird.
Um, okay, so, phase two.
Didn't Schmidt make us get renter's insurance when he almost tore down that rafter with the sex swing?
Jess, we fake a robbery.
We fake a robbery for the insurance.
That's a great idea.
We're a couple of meth-heads.
- Oh, yeah.
- Boom.
Got any meth?
Got any rings on your fingers?
I need them for meth.
Get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all, get it all.
Whoa!
Do we have to steal my moustache trimmer?
This is worth three bowls of sweet, sweet meth.
- This?
This?
- No.
No.
This?
I just don't think the meth-heads would want anything in this room.
What about this?
A land line?
To me, it looks like a meth sandwich.
Don't hog all the meth, daddy.
Did you hit this already?
- No, did you?
- No.
What are you doing?
You're smothering me, all right?
I'm done with this!
At least leave your wallet!
I'm out of here!
Would you like a whiskey?
What?
I said that because I know you like whiskey.
You're a whiskey girl, like me.
You're a whiskey girl?
I'm Nick.
I'm Angie.
Angie Angie, Angie.
Well, what are you standing there for?
Go grab a bottle and get me drunk, idiot.
Well, I-I couldn't drink with you-- I work here.
Just kidding, I get drunk, like, all the time.
I've got a drinking thing.
You got it.
I also have all the access to pistachios if you want, like, a full I'll make my own mind up on that.
He took my doctor's appointment suit!
He took El Capitan!
Damn it!
The only thing he left was my summer suit with the lightning bolt on the back.
I keep that in my summer bin along with my summer condoms-- citrus-flavored, for a more refreshing summer experience.
- That's a jar - Jar for sure, yeah.
Look at this-- took my suits.
Left the left the douche bag jar.
Typical meth-head.
- Typical meth-head.
- Yeah, it's a shame.
Good thing that I have a security camera in there.
I'm gonna download the footage and I.D. this S.O.B. He's going down.
I respect the amount you drink-- - Oh, - FYI these drinks - aren't free.
- Wow, well, joke's on you 'cause Mike left with all my money.
Oh, really!
Then how you gonna pay for the drinks?
Oh probably with sex?
Sorry That is not pretty.
Well I was gonna let you have sex with Mike.
- Oh - What?
It's good.
That was an old switcheroo.
I just want to say you two, uh What?
- No, no, I don't want to say.
- Come on, what?
I don't want to say.
I don't feel like it's-- - The point is it's not my - What are you afraid of?
- You're thinking it.
- I'm not afraid, but He's kind of an ass-- damn it!
You think I should break up with Mike?
No, no, that is not my place to - Well, you did; it is your place.
- But I've been drinking with you, and I feel like you're luring me in Dump his ass!
Damn it.
I can't believe you'd say that to me.
You should mind your own business.
So many years of footage.
This is from last May.
I was trying to add an extra ab muscle.
Jess, I can't take this This is when I was experimenting with faux hawks.
- I can't, I can't, I can't take it, Jess.
- You can.
- You're gonna blow this.
- My face is numb.
This is when I was lowering my bar sexually.
- Why is my face numb?
- Okay, I'm gonna say this once.
- Tighten up.
- Okay, yeah.
I can't believe this is happening.
It's such an important day.
What's happening today?
I just have to look good.
Okay?
Not like some Ukrainian dentist.
Oh, my God.
- Jess, I'm dying.
- What's wrong with you.
I'm dying, Jess.
Jess, pretend you're not seeing this Schmidt, this isn't a good time.
Cece, please.
Just just open the box.
You brought a pigeon into my house?
I couldn't find a dove.
Come on, Beatty.
It's it was supposed to fly out when you opened up the lid.
- What are you doing?
- I love you, Cece.
And I have been in love with you for so long.
I used to think it was just a heavy like, but it's love.
- There it goes.
- Is this real?
For you?
Yes.
Cece, I'm ready for a serious commitment.
I'm up for a huge promotion at work.
I'm ready to have kids with you, if that's what you want.
You want to have kids?
Let's go right now, let's go make a kid.
Take your top off.
Schmidt, my mother she's gonna hate you.
Okay?
You're Jewish.
She hates Jews; I mean, she really hates them.
Everybody hates the Jews.
Your mom's in the majority.
I'll convert to Indianism.
Hindi Hindi-iseh?
Indiani-Indi Indi-Buddhi-ism?
Schmidt, we have so much going against us.
Let's have dinner.
Tonight.
Okay.
Cool.
No, yeah, cool.
Just give me a second.
Ah yes!
I'm sorry.
Wiston, are you out of your head?
Security camera.
What are you doing?
Schmidt has a security camera.
Why did I think he didn't have a security camera?
Oh.
You're a briefs man.
I was hoping I'd never find out.
Oh, my goodness, we should not have gone for that tub.
I just like bubbles so much Winston, I think you're having a panic attack.
Hmm?
Shut up, hey, Jess, no.
I'm, uh this is just the willies.
The w the what?
The the willies?
The willies, yeah.
It's the same thing that happened when I took my driver's test.
Go ahead and start the car.
No!
No!
A lot of people get panic attacks.
- The willies.
- My dad used to get them all the time.
Like, every time he had to make a left turn.
It would take him two and a half hours to drive me to school.
We'd just drive all around Portland, making right turns.
- Okay.
- It's okay.
- Okay.
- It's really okay.
Are you going to tell anybody about my underwear?
Look, I really want to.
But I won't.
- Where is he?
- It's over, Mike.

You're a dead man!
I had it handled!
He was gonna kill you.
I've seen him do it.
- I know someone at work who can stitch him up.
- Okay, let's get him - stitched up right now.
This is disgusting.
- Okay.
I'm out there every night, balling to the max, and you expect me to do what, just stop and chew up some cherry-flavored multi-V?
No, thanks.
I'll take my vitamins on the rocks.
Double V. Heart.
Spirit.

You gotta get specific about this vodka.
- Have you tried Double V?
- No.
Let's open up this bitch.
Let's open up okay.

Each shot that you do, makes me know you're going that extra mile.

- What?
- Okay.
- But you said-- - No, I no, no, no.
Let's-let's just all right, we'll do it.
Don't feel weird, Winston.
Everybody has their weird thing.
Even me.
Look, I'm gonna tell you something about myself.
I am really claustrophobic.
- Jess, I don't believe you.
- No, seriously, watch.
- You seem fine to me.
- I seem fine, but if I close the door, it's gonna feel like I'm dying even more than a real death.
It just feels like death plus more death.
Okay, this is silly.
Just come on.
But I'm gonna be okay, because I know you're out there.
- Mm-hmm.
- And you can help me Oh, my God Okay - Oh, my God.

Uh, he remembered that he was married to you, so he tried to beat the memory out of his brain with a brick.
- Oh, he's married - You stupid bitch!
Oh, not okay!
Ladies!
Stop fighting!
Hey, hey!
Stop this now!
Don't stop this!
I'm super aroused!
I think I just became a dirt bag.
Why did I cross the bar?
I did it.
- I'm here for dinner.
I made it.
- It's really late.
We got the account.
I was with my boss, we got the account.
- We did it.
- You were with your boss?
What?

- The woman who made you sign a contract - so she could have sex with you, your boss?
- No.
No.
Uh - Yeah.
- Yeah.
No but nothing happened.
She just wanted me to taste the V. That came out wrong.
- Yeah.
- I thought about I thought about the boss's boobs once.
They're still real nice, but I didn't have no connection to them emotionally, whatsoever.
Nothing.
Cece, I can pay for our baby's college now.
Literally anywhere they want to go.
UCLA, UMass any of the U schools.
- I love you so much.
- You should probably Oh, not It's okay.
Cece, I'm gonna pee in my summer suit.
Hey, Mom, it's me.
I think I'm ready to have you set me up.
This is not a prank.
Call me back.
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Thank you, man.
- I see.
If you guys have been playing hard to get, you don't have to.
I am totally ready to get mixed up in this choco-vanilla shake.
No.
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about here.
- I'm just talking about - Yes I know, I know.
We got it, we got it, Remy.
- doing it with-with both of you.
- We got it.
Yeah.
Three This never happened.
Jess, I just want to say thank you.
You know, I thought I was the only crazy one, but it turns out you're nuts as well.
Oh, I'm straight-up bananas, Winston.
Next time that happens to you, just come to me, and I'll help you keep your pants on.
So what are we gonna do about Schmidt's suits?
I feel like there's a very obvious solution.
Oh, come on!
Again?
Thank God.
The meth-heads came back.
They brought your suits back 'cause they don't fit them.
They did the right thing, 'cause they're - drug addicts, they're not monsters.
- Right.
They actually got them dry-cleaned, um deluxe package, very pricey.
Why'd he tie you up?
They kept saying, like, "Ah, I'm so hungry for more meth," you know?
"Let's get rid of these suits.
These clean suits".
Jess and I want a tub.
We want candles and bubbles.
Oh, damn it, Schmidt, we want bubbles, man.
I want to cover everything up on my body with bubbles.
You know, and then just blow 'em off like this and laugh, like Get a tub, man.
Let's get a tub; I don't care.
- Hey.
- You okay?
What's wrong?
I told Cece that I loved her.
Then I got drunk, and she called her mom, and She's going brown.
She wants to marry a brown man.
- Schmidt - Schmidt!
- Hey, man.
- Hey - Hey, hey, hey.
- Hold it right there.
Let it go, man.
- Let it go.
- Okay.
How'd you guys get out of your ties?
Hey Hey.
What can I get you to drink, Angie?
Oh, no, I don't I just want to hang out.
I've got this rule.
Never cross the bar.
And I broke that rule, and Look, these 18 inches of oak are the only thing that separates me from guys like Sid over there.
No disrespect.
I got your next round.
Well, I don't have any rules.
Don't do don't No customers behind the bar.
Oh, Sid, you gotta You're killing me.
Sit down and drink your beer.
I'm a man with feelings.
Feelings that are bubbling up inside of me, and they're about to explode.

Look at your face!
You got this, son!
Well, I love you And I've never said those words Well, I love you, from the bo
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
You know, maybe I found out too early.
I was five years old when "Santa" gave me my own fire truck and a teddy bear that smelled like my dad's cigarettes.
That's not Santa.
I just believe things and go on believing them.
If someone tells me a fat man's bringing me dolls every year, - I just don't question it.
- You would've been my nightmare.
We were on very strict instructions from Rabbi Schmulie not to say a word until the last Christian kid found out about Santa Claus.
Ruining Christmas, very bad for our brand.
Well, whether or not Santa's real, it's just nice to have something to believe in.
Did you just say "Whether or not Santa's real"?
- You don't believe in Santa Claus, do you?
- No.
Do I wish Santa was real?
- I mean, yeah.
- Santa's not real, Winston.
Shut up, stupid!
You're a dummy!
So and I don't even c Like, you're the Okay, aw, here we go.
You know what, look who's talking.
You're the same guy who only eats mayonnaise on game days.
That's how you makee the Chicago Bears win.
Hey, Winnie, were you a good boy this year?
Oh, really?
Stop, guys, stop!
Don't throw the cranberries!
- Get him!
- Stop!
- I don't mess around!
- No!
- Truce!
Truce!
Truce!
- Go for the eyes!
Truce!
Truce!
One got stuck in my ear.
We got a cranberry in his ear.
How is that even possible?
Why don't you ask Santa Claus to take - the cranberry out of your ear?
- Huh?
!
I said it got stuck in my ear!
Truce!
Truce!
Truce!
Truce!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
These pieces don't make a full berry.
There's definitely something still stuck in there.
Hey, would anybody mind giving me a ride to the airport tomorrow?
Full disclosure: It's out of San Diego at 3:00 a.m. So tonight's our last chance for a holiday hang-together?
A group hang on the Saturday before Christmas?
No, sorry, I can't tonight, Jess.
Office party.
There are literally millions of parties.
It's a puzzle as That's what you guys are talking about, right?
I mean, it's not like I can hear anything, because I got a cranberry stuck in my ear!
- You're yelling.
- Huh?
Slade and Sienna are having a house thing.
Oshiro-San is serving whale meat after midnight.
- Huh?
What y'all talking about?
- Shut up.
Sadie is having a cookie-decorating party.
The gorilla twins are having a thump-thump.
Let's try to hit all the parties we can.
Otherwise, I'm just gonna stay home and try not to call Sam.
- What'd you say?
- I'm gonna die alone.
And merry Christmas.
- We have to hang out together.
- I hate that idea.
I'll be designated driver.
- I'm in.
- Okay, yeah, let's do it.
The only we make this work is if we do the Irish good-bye.
We leave the parties without saying good-bye.
And I'm asking you guys as my friends to not be so damn awkward around my stripper girlfriend, just 'cause she's a stripper.
You are the most awkward.
You should probably stop calling her your "stripper girlfriend".
She's unpredictable and exciting, and I love that!
Ol' Nick Miller lives on the edge now.
Vroom!
Vroom!
And plus, we haven't had sex yet, and we might tonight.
I understood that!
Oh, yeah!
What'd you say, though?
On the first day of Christmas My true love gave to me a partridge Merry Christmas!
Am I talking too loud?
- Schmidt?
- What?
- A word?
- What?
You haven't said one word to Cece since she got in the car.
I cannot believe that you invited her.
She's my best friend.
- Hey, can I talk to you a little later?
- Oh, were you hoping that I still had some soul left for you to crush?
I'm glad we're gonna be mature about this.
Whoa, what happened there?
Nothing.
He told her that he loved her Okay, I just want to spend the night making it with some fatty in an elf costume.
Is that too much to ask for?
Instead I'm stuck here at this Lesbian cookie party.
It's all wreaths, no trees.
All right, Jess, you're on the clock; You have five minutes in this party black hole.
- Your friends are cool.
- Yeah, no, no, I like them.
- Yeah, they - I live with them.
But being serious, it's been really fun.
I'm glad we're hanging out and spending time together and all that good stuff.
You know, to be completely honest, when I first met you, I didn't think that you could handle this.
Handle what?
The fact that you're a stripper?
- Me being Yeah.
- Are you kidding?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Is it good?
You're sweating a little bit.
You know what, lady, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks.
I've had tetanus thrice in my life.
- Ew.
- And look at what a badass cookie I made.
That's the kind of cookie Nick Miller makes.
- Fine, look at my cookie.
- What?
Yeah, but there are people here.
Are you not into having sex around people?
Who are you talking to?
- Yeah?
- I'm so open with sex, it's ridiculous.
You could at least take your coat off.
Oh, but I can't.
Pastel walls give me the chills.
- Hey.

- What?
- What - It's Sam!
It's Sam!
Put your coats on.
- We're leaving.
- Sam Sam?
Where?
Yes, he's right over there.
He's talking to a woman whose sexuality I won't jump to conclusions about.
What a situation, huh, Jess?
Forced to spend time with someone who ruthlessly rejected you after you told him how much you cared about him.
- Maybe - Damn, he looks good.
Just wants everyone to get along.
Okay, if he wanted everybody to get along I'm seriously freaking out right now.
then he wouldn't have acted like such a callous lady jerk.
- Lady jerk?
- Lady jerk.
I'm seriously freaking out right now.
- Duck!
He's gonna see you.
- Ow.
We have to get out of here, you guys.
Where is everybody?
Yeah, man, see, when a cranberry gets lodged in the ear, it hurts.
Look.
- Psst, Winston.
- Hey!
Do you guys know Sam's here?
- Jess?
- We're Irish good-bye-ing.
Go!
Go!

- Go, go!
Go!
Go!

All right, Schmidt, what's the address?
Get ready, last year this party had acrobats and caged snow leopards.
What?
!
We're all here together.
No drama.
- Not bad, Schmidt.
- Thank you.
Are they just gonna play computer music all night?
What are you talking about?
That's a really respected deejay, who was also an actor on Boy Meets World.
- Hey, Jess.
Whoa, Sam.
- What?
!
No!
Why is this happening?
No.
Please, I need to talk Oh, God.
No.
Oh, my Oh, I feel like a bird.
Aw, that's just sad.
- How are you here?
- Winston told me where the party was in exchange for an ear exam.
Winston told you what?
!
What?
Jess, listen to me.
I want you back, Jess.
Oh.
Oh!
Are none of these doors?
Oh!
What, he just wants a relationship now, out of the blue?
You never just dreamed about him crawling back to you?
Anybody who's ever been dumped has dreamed about that special someone crawling their way back to them.
I mean, come on, right?
It's the dump fantasy.
Let's workshop that term.
Of course I have.
We meet in a hospital, during wartime.
You can forgive a lot during wartime.
That is a fantasy, Jess.
Okay, people don't change.
They just think that they do.
He's a player.
Think about it.
Why would a good-looking person ever become a doctor?
Jess?
Oh, my God!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go.
- Door - Jess?
Jess, uh, I don't know if you're in here.
I just wanted to tell you that I messed up.
You know, I-I went to that party to see you.
I knew you were gonna be there, 'cause I saw the comments on the Evite.
"Amazeballs, can't wait".
If you are here, I'm sorry if this sounds a little rehearsed.
This is the third room I've done this in.
Hey, what's he saying?
- I want to hear - Shut up, Winston.
Jess?
- Jess?
- Yep.
No.
You just think you can come back and I'm just gonna be waiting for you?
No, of course not.
I mean I had to at least try.
You're too late.
I'm in love.
What?
With Winston.
What?
We've lain together.
No, yeah, I don't know how it happened.
It just got stuck up there so far, so quickly.
The relationship.
You know, sometimes when we're hanging out, it can get a little rough.
- Oh, boy, does it.
- Yeah.
All right.
Well, I didn't know that, so What's going on?
I feel like I'm missing something.
Snow time.
Hey, what are you doing?
No, no, no.
Hey, everything is so expensive here, Angie.
Don't.
Get off that thing.
Why don't you get on?
You know what?
Get in the sleigh, girl.
What happens in the sleigh?
What happens in the sleigh - is I'll be your reindeer - Uh-huh.
And take your toys up in the sky.
Sexy.
Ooh!
Ho ho ho!
Here comes the chubby Santa boy!
Get in here.
This is real.

What's that?
A nearly perfect Liam Neeson.

This isn't This is my nightmare!
Merry Christmas!
Oh.
Hey.
I know I know you're trying to avoid me, but just take this gift I got you and I will walk away.
I don't celebrate Christmas, okay?
Or as I like to call it, White Anglo-Saxon Winter Privilege Night.
I really want us to be friends.
Whenever you're ready.
Because I really do care about you.
Thank you so much for this.
'Cause this makes it so much better.
Here.
This is for you.
What if you came home with me tonight?
You look like a hot elf.
- Hold still.
- Uh-huh.
Got it.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, man.
Now that I think about it, I mean, I'm not really surprised by you and you know.
I mean, three guy roommates.
If I really am being honest with you, you were the only one that I was really threatened by.
I mean, you got Metrosexual Jones and Sweatshirt Guy over there.
What are we talking about here?
Yeah, I would trade places with you in a heartbeat.
You know, except for the mustache.
Can I ask you something?
How did you get her?
Oh Hmm.
Jess.
Yes.
Yes, my love.
Honey, we both know we have been unhappy for far too long.
I am not just a vehicle you get to ride to Pleasure Town.
Be gone, honky!
This is for your own good.
Say good-bye to paradise, honey!
We were never going out.
Yeah, I got that.
I mean, Sam, what am I supposed to think?
So what?
I'm just supposed to believe you when all of a sudden you come back to me, and you tell me you want to make it work?
I-I want to believe you, but I just feel so No!
No!
Why do you think you can just kiss me?
I thought that was the right That's all this ever was to you.
- That's not true, Jess.
- No.
No.
I'm always so gullible, and I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it anymore.
I'm done.
Oh, I mean, I get it.
I'm I'm too late.
I messed up.
Yeah, you did.
You messed up.
Well, I'll leave you alone.
Merry Christmas.
No!
I'm leaving you alone.
I know I know you do this kind of thing all the time, but believe it or not, I don't.
What?
What does that mean?
Look, I know for you, this kind of stuff is normal.
- Oh.
- Doing it in sleds.
- And - Oh, this is because I'm a stripper.
Yeah.
- Are you laughing at me?
- No.
I'm laughing into me.
- Maybe you just can't handle this.
- No.
It's great.
You're a stripper for now.
I'm a bartender for now.
- For now?
- We're not gonna be that for Okay, well, for now, I'm just gonna walk away.
For now, you can kiss my ass.

Even if I was the wrong person.

It is a lie.
So, bah humbug to you, Cecilia.

She's so out there and adventurous, and not afraid, and She's probably bored of me already.
I mean, she doesn't want to be here.
Does Angie ever do anything she doesn't want to do?
No.
What's wrong with a girl that's fearless?
I think that could be good for you, especially since you're such a chicken.
Don't.
Go get her.
Is this on?
It's on.
Right on.
Cool.
Um Angie?

Just come, Nick.
Why not?
Angie and I are not romantic weekend types.
Sounds like you need some fresh air in a cabin You're dating a stripper.
I'm dating a tall, handsome doctor.
We're both kind of living the dream.
We're not "dating".
What Angie and I have together is pure anarchy in like, a sexy, cool way.
- Oh, yeah?
- Look at what she did while I was sleeping.
Look at how cool that is.
She doodled on your armpit?
- It's not a doodle, it's a tat.
- Of poodle hair?
It's not poodle hair.
It's like the, uh Anyway, no to the cabin.
- All right.
- And why do you want us to come on your romantic weekend anyhow?
I thought it was just supposed to be you and the doctor.
Okay, I'm a little nervous.
I just need backup.
I want this weekend to be fun and perfect and lovely, and I want him to look at me at the end and go, "Jess, that was the best weekend I ever had".
I'm glad you're keeping your expectations at a reasonable level.

Now, I have a spatula in my hand the entire time, and I'm looking her directly in the eye, and I say, "You're damn right I want some cake".
Kind of weird.
Hey, what's up?
Guys, this is Schmidt.
Hey.
Ready to go?
Yeah, no, let's do it.
It's nice meeting you all.
Hey, uh, Winston, who are those guys?

We can stay, if you want.
No, Schmidt, I don't want to stay.
I want to eat.
Come on, man.
White Nick, brown Cece.
I'd like to have a frank discussion about race.
Do you think that we're allowing Winston to be his blackest self?
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Okay, make sure Jess gets these, okay?
Guys, please, I'm being serious.
Okay, Schmidty, I know that you're being serious, but look, Winston has been black his entire life.
I think he knows how to handle it.
We were out the other night for drinks, and well, he encountered some members of his own, and you should have seen the way that he lit up.
I mean, he was like a glow stick.
- This is terrible.
- Whatever you were gonna do, please do not.
- Just don't do it.
- I want to create an environment within this loft where Winston feels free, where the gates are open.
Let's let Winston turn on his-his black switch and let his black light shine.
This is perfect.
Yes, it is a weekend in the woods.
I'm just glad that we get to spend some time together.

Perfect weekend!

Ooh, you ain't lying, child.
Thanks for dinner, Schmidt.
You know, I really appreciate it, man.
- I do feel supported.
- So what's next?
There is this one thing that I miss.
I probably shouldn't say, man.
- I can't.
- No, come on.
It's us, man.
Schmidt, I could really go for some crack.
What?
Crack cocaine?
I remember when I was a kid, me, my mom, and her mom, and well, her mom, and then her mom, and then of course her mom, and then my little cousin, Peanut, they'd all rush back to that flaming trash can where we'd sit around and harmonize and just shoo-op.
One of those nights I remember, well, we ran out of crack.
I'd grab my scarf, and I would run on down to the liquor store where the thugs hang out, and I would try to get a good deal on some crack.
Whoo!
They never would give me a good price, man, but, uh, I tell you what, there's nothing like the the feel of a fire, a fresh-baked cookie, and that sweet, sweet taste of crack in your lungs.
Okay.
Okay, Winston, yeah.
Sure, I mean, if If that is something that you want to do See, I knew you were gonna judge me.
I knew it.
No, Winston.
I knew you were gonna judge me and just Winston, listen to me.
Look if crack cocaine is what you want then crack cocaine is what we are going to get.
How do we do this?
Here's what we do, Schmidt.
We go to the projects, okay?
We knock on some doors.
I'll wait in the car and take lookout while you do all the legwork.
Because as you say, you are in much better shape than I am.
You do have the body of a Smurf.
We could We could just get frozen yogurt.
It's not a big deal.
Schmidt isn't about no frozen yogurt.
I want to go score some crack cocaine.
Really?
We're gonna do this.
Look at them.
This is a cabin, guys.
Getting wasted on a couple of shots of absinthe.
Word games, word games, word games, word games, word games.
Doctor!
I was saying I don't think I feel it.
I can't believe I'm the sober one.
That's actually never happened in my life.
Who wants to play Charades?
Me.
One syllable, one syllable.
Movie.
Gattaca.
Oh, I want to be them.
I have to run upstairs for a sec.
I have it on good authority my bed has disappeared.
I need to go check it out.
I got to head up there and take care of that.
Oh, you-you're gonna go upstairs?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Now?
Yeah.
Oh, ho-ho-ho, yeah.
Okay.
Have fun.
I will, I guess.
Up.
Doesn't sound good.
Oh, Jess.
- That sounded terrible.
- The absinthe has found a new host.
The toilet.
Oh I like Angie.
She's cool.
It's kind of like riding a poorly maintained carnival ride.
I'm glad you get it.
I think she really likes you.
All right.
Jeth I'm not I'm-I'm with Jeth.
Hey, Nick, look, we switched.
And look middle of the night What is the big deal?
I why else did we all go to a cabin together?
To hike?
Guys, I'm still really feeling it.
I just can't believe you'd do that to Nick.
She didn't do anything to me.
We have an open relationship.
She can do whatever she wants.
I don't care.
Enough.
I'm tired of you acting like this cool guy with an "open relationship".
That is not you.
Yes, it is, Jess.
Why won't you just let me be me?
This is me!
I'm sorry.
I just don't believe you.
You're not this guy.
No, no, no, I'm not feeling good At least we don't pretend to be this perfect couple.
I do not pretend to be a perfect couple.
The only reason that we're here is 'cause you asked us to come, 'cause you didn't want to be alone with Dr. Sam.
'Cause then you'd have to be real with him.
Jess?
Is that true?
Yes, but no it's out of context.
It's out of context, Nick.
You think you know everything about me.
- I'm a rock and roll guy.
- You are the guy who asks me to light matches for you 'cause you're afraid your fingers are gonna get too hot.
- I did that one time.
- Multiple times.
I was on the back of a motorcycle earlier, and I wasn't even that scared.
- You don't think I'm crazy?
- No.
Would a sane man do this?
Oh!
Oh!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're doing it.
You're doing a lot of it.
You need to just pace it a little bit Oh, whoa, that you're really doing it.
Whoa!
Well?
I suppose we could just get out and ask any of these street youths.
I'll let you get out the car first.
Go ahead, do your thing, man.
I don't want to ask the wrong person and end up with some sub-par crack.
I want the fresh crack, you know?
Not some crack that's been laying around all day.
Ooh I'm really starting to schvitz.
We don't have to do this.
Man, we could just turn this car around, forget this ever happened, and get you some frozen yogurt.
I will not let you deny who you are any longer.
Not on my watch.
- Schmidt - Hey, psst!
- Schmidt, no.
- Yes.
Skee-you!
- Skee-you!
- Schmidt!
You, dude.
Don't call that man to this car.
Hi, how are you this evening?
What do you guys need?
It's cool, just get in the car, man.
- What cool?
- Yeah, we're cool.
Schmidt, you did not invite this guy in this car.
He could be crazy, could have a gun.
- That's a racist thing to say, Winston, that he - Stop it, Schmidt Just assuming that this man has a pistol.
Hi, sir.
How are you this evening?
Um, the two of us are very interested in purchasing some crack cocaine.
You guys cops?
- What?
- Okay, let me out.
Schmidt, Schmidt I was just messing with you, man.
Okay?
I was just trying to see how far your stupid white guilt would take you.
Have you ever done crack?
Hell, no, I've never done crack, man.
Why do you think I've done crack?
Because I'm black?
I thought you'd done crack 'cause you told me - the whole story about you doing crack.
- I though you guys just needed directions, okay?
- Let me out!
- Okay, sir, - just calm down, all right?
- Oh, please, man.
- Be cool.
- Fine, okay, look, you want it?
You want it?
Look!
- Whoa!
No!
- Oh my God, no!
- Look, my wallet.
- No!
No!
Take my wallet!
Here's my wallet, okay?
Shoot the white dude!
Just let me out Shoot him!
No, don't shoot me!
Shoot him, man!
But that's - That's your wallet.
- That's your wallet.
- Are you not robbing us?
- You're not robbing me?
- I don't want to rob you, man.
- I thought you were gonna I totally misread the situation.
- I thought you was robbing me.
- Oh, no, man.
- Oh, hey, man, I'm Schmidt.
- Robert, man.
- Robert.
Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure, man.
Robert, man, hey, man, nice to meet you, man.
- What a nice smile he has.
All right, guys.
- I'm just Okay.
Here, I'll they're the child locks.
- I don't even have kids, but - You guys have a great night, okay?
- You, too, man.
Be safe.
- Take care, Robert.
- Take it easy, man.
- You guys have a good night, man, all right.
That was insane.
- I was terrified.
That - Oh, my goodness.
I judged - God, Robert!
- Robert I just the wallet?
- Oh, your wallet - Oh, your wallet.
- Just give him the wallet.
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, it's kind of - No, yeah, I get it.
I'd want my wallet back, too.
- Thank you.
- All right.
Thanks, Robert.
- I wouldn't thank him.
- Whoa, man.
What a hilarious misunderstanding.
- Schmidt, drive the damn car.
- No, you're right.
You know, I feel so much better after throwing up into the fire.
Uh, Sam, can you pass the bread?
- Oh, sure thing.
- No, I'll pass the bread, Angie.
Just keep your hands to yourself and let the bread come to you.
- Why do you keep taking my bread?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you and the bread had an open relationship.
I said I was sorry.
I thought this was an agreement.
I thought we were all cool with this.
I don't Absinthe!
Fun dinner.
Fun dinner.
I always have fun at the cabin.
You guys want to pick my brain?
You guys want to know what I'm thinking about?
I like dogs more than cats.
I like chipmunks more than squirrels.
I believe in UFOs.
I once had a bass teacher, when I was younger, who did the standing bass.
And he had a very weird smell, and I still think about it.
His name was Mr. Hilton.
I don't like the fact that you tried to kiss Sam.
Because I have feelings for you, Angie.
I'm I had no idea, I'm sorry.
I know.
We said it was open, but I'm proud of you for saying that.
Dr. Sam?
If you were a hat, you'd be a top hat.
But like a really big Monopoly one.
And I say that of the deepest compliments.
Appreciate it.
Winston, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help.
What, help me realize that I'm black?
Schmidt, believe it or not, man, I've known that for a while now.
I just feel bad you're forced to live here with Jess and Nick.
- Oh, wow.
- I mean, they're honky as hell.
And look at our people.
Look what we've given to this country.
Jazz The management of jazz musicians.
But, look, Schmidt, being black means whatever I want it to mean.
You know, the fact of the matter is I live in a loft with three people who happen to be white.
But believe you me, there is so much more that I find annoying about you that I haven't even gotten to race.
Now, I'm gonna get some frozen yogurt.
Would you like anything?
Yeah.
I'll have a vanilla chocolate swirl.
- No.
- What, no No.
I'll have strawberry with jimmies.
Did you get that?
Hey.
How you doing?
Much better.
That alcohol got on top of me.
Oh I'm a little embarrassed by that.
I'm sorry about Sam.
I I thought it was cool.
- Right.
- And I try to ruin things as soon as they get good.
I'm working on it.
Believe it or not, I'm working on stuff, too.
You know, I just wish I was working on less stuff.
You know, I've been arrested three times.
Four times.
Four to five times.
I have tattoos of bands that I don't even like anymore.
By the way, you've been really cool about the "Jamiroquai" tattoo on my butt.
I'm not asking you to change.
Just how about meet me in the middle a little bit?
What do you want me to do?
Go to brunch?
Are we supposed to, like, read articles and then talk about them together?
Okay, I'm never going to be that kind of girl.
I just want to do something normal.
How about not drawing pubes on my armpit while I'm sleeping?
You think you could do something like that?
Yeah.
Yeah.
'Cause I would really like to keep this going.
Want to move your twin bed over here?
Sexy, sexy, sexy.
Bird!
Bird!
Bird!
- Bird!
- Oh.
- Help!
Help!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
No big, I got it!
I'm on it.
Just a it was a painting.
That's not really how I wanted the weekend to go.
I thought the worst thing that could happen was someone wouldn't like the cheese I brought.
I wanted it to be perfect.
Jess, when Nick said that you invited them because you were nervous - No, don't worry about that.
- Jess, we're not perfect.
Like the first time we slept together, like, I didn't even know your real name.
Kind of a pretty sassy detail.
Can we just concentrate on the fact that, like, I was tripping pretty hard on absinthe and I said, "No"?
To a stripper?
I mean, a stripper was like rubbing my leg That's weirdly the most romantic thing I've ever heard.
- Got it.
- I left a Post-it note on the transformer that said "Broken".
Is there any way that we could make it look - like it was raccoon bites?
- A few announcements.
Uh Angie left.
Me.
- What?
- She took the motorcycle, and, uh, a few of my belongings, but I'm still wearing my underwear, so she comes up short-handed in that treasure hunt.
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Nick.
I'm sorry, man.
It's fine; I'm a grown man.
I will need a ride home.
- Yeah.
- Obviously.
I would love to pitch in with gas, but I don't have any money, so I could pay in "Nick Bucks," fully redeemable for smiles and any one item from my bureau.
We'll hold you to that.
Thank you, Doctor.
Don't, I-I'm good.
- I know you don't want to be hugged.
- I don't want to be hugged.
- And I respect that.
So - Okay.
'Cause I'm fine.
Jess, no, I'm good, I'm good.
I promise you, I'm good.
Just Actually, this is very weird for me.
- I'm not hugging you.
- I know.
- I'm sorry.
- I promise you I'm okay.
Stop making this a thing, because I'm not sad.
- This is for the best.
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.
- She didn't deserve you.
Whatever that means.
- Thank you.
- Okay, almost there.
- Hey, let's go!
- All right.
Hey, the potato salad's accidentally in the garbage.
Look at that.
You guys mind if I eat this in the back seat?
You can eat salad in my back seat anytime.
Didn't mean that to be sexual.
All right, guys.
It's a little bit gamey.
Okay.
I'll get the garbage, here.
Hold on, hold on.
The absinthe.
You almost screwed that up by accident.
Wow.
We're ready.
You all right?
Yep, I'll be right with you guys.
That was a mistake!
Whoo!
I am gonna poop weird tonight!
Yeah Oooh, that was a mistake.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
All right, Nick, we believe in you, man.
Tell us, what's in the cup?
Ah, it's a hard one.
It's a mini carrot.
Onion and potato?
Dumbest boy in all the world.
How are you so bad at Feely-Cup?
You are awful at this game.
Sea glass?
I'm overthinking it.
If his life depended on this, he would die.
- Battery.
- When are batteries squishy?
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding-- I know it's not a battery.
I'm kidding.
Feel, Nick.
Nick, will you be paying for bonus time?
He can't; He is all out of quarters.
Uh, Nick?
Your dad's here.
Very funny, Schmidty, but my concentration will not be broken.
Hey-ya, Nickels.
Come on, kid, bring it in.
Come on!
Hello, Mr. Miller.
Welcome to our home.
- Feely-Cup?
- Oh, yeah.
Bring it on.
Watch this.
Tampon Wrapped in duct tape And dipped in baking powder.
- Is that what it is?
Oh, it is.
- Boom!
- Next level Feely-Cup.
- Hello, Mr. Miller.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
This is a pleasant surprise.
What brings you to Los Angeles, Dad?
Let me just, uh, clean up a little bit.
You know, I just thought I'd stop by.
I'll sleep in your bed, you can go on the couch.
Sounds like us.
Hey.
So, what does Mr. Miller do?
- Businessman.
- A what?
- He's a con man.
- He is a con man.
- He is a damn business-- What are you talking about?
- He's a con man.
- He's a businessman.
Winston's obsessed with Walt.
That moustache first of all-- what?
!
It's like the world's sexiest push broom.
A con man like, "What's the play"?
The, uh, Ring-A-Doo Johnnycakes?
The, uh, Hollow Leg Swap-Em-Out?
Yes, exactly.
Fake trombones for a fake band.
Harold Hill!
Music Man?
No, he is not a con man, okay?
You know, he sometimes used to sell hats.
There you go, boys-- enjoy.
Thanks, Dad.
So many hats.
Okay, technically, they were misprints.
This says: "Chica Go Bills".
Let's go, guys-- these hats suck.
"Chica Go Bills" is, uh, actually Spanish for "Young girl, go Bills".
Who's gonna mess with a guy who's wearing a hat that says, "Young girl, go Bills"?
I mean, the answer is everybody.
They will, they mess with you.
Oh, my Nick, please do not angry-fix the sink.
I'm not angry-fixing; I'm fixing!
You want to know why I'm messed up?
Why I don't trust people?
Why I have anger issues?
Oh, yes, I do want to know.
Why I have the blood pressure of a hummingbird?
Do you think this is maybe about your dad?
And so Nickels comes into my room screaming, "Daddy, Daddy".
So I go, "What's wrong"?
He says, "Daddy, I have a tick at the end of my tinkle".
Oh, my God!
- This is not a story for everyone.
- And sure enough, there is a tick at the end of his little penis.
Not a story for this moment.
That's how he got the nickname "Little Penis".
Oh, stop calling me that.
- What are we gonna do with this guy?
- I have no idea, Pop-Pop.
- Don't call him Pop-Pop.
- That's his nickname.
- The nickname is longer than Walt.
- But that's the nickname - that I gave him.
- Yeah, but it's really weird that you call my dad Pop-Pop.
- I like Pop-Pop.
- You don't get it.
You don't get it.
Yeah, fine, just don't call him Pop-Pop, so I think it's time for another drink.
What do you say, gorgeous?
You want to give an old man a hand?
Sure.
I don't know, Nick.
A lot of charm coming from this end of the booth.
'Cause that's what he does.
He lures you in with his charm and his moustache and his perfect hair.
I feel like you need to talk to him about this.
Right, 'cause I'll just tell him how I feel, and everything will be okay 'cause that's really the way the world works.
Took the words right out of my mouth, Little Penis.
- It's not a thing.
- I love a good nickname.
Not not gonna stick.
You know, when Nick is not working here, the service is abysmal.
I mean, how many times did I have to repeat the words, "Lemon Drop shot"?
Yeah, I think he was making fun of you.
For what?
Working hard and playing hard?
I guess the joke is on me.
Another Indian guy?
- My mom set me up.
- Oh, your mom.
- That's cool.
- Mm-hmm.
Have fun with your, your Devs and your and your An-Anujs or your Deepaks.
Whatever Patel you're dating.
I'm-I'm not sweating it.
His name's Pavun, Pavun Shetty.
What?
- As in, as in "Shetty Solutions"?
- I think so.
Why?
They only nailed the crowd-control logistics of Bombay's revamped open-air market.
I thought you weren't sweating it.
I'm not sweating it.
Sweating it.
Killing me with that Drop, dude.
You really seem to care about Little Nicky.
I mean, look at him.
He looks like Hilary Swank mixed with a sad, wet dog.
Do you think he's really angry at me?
I think you need to talk to him.
All I'm looking for is a second chance.
You don't happen to believe in second chances, do you, Blue Eyes?
Actually, I, um I'm a bit of a sucker for second chances.
They're my first favorite kind of chance.
Have you ever been to the racetrack?
Back at the tracks with my dad.
When Nick was a kid, he would come to the track with me all the time.
And if I got in trouble, he would get me out of it by doing the Sugar Ray.
- Oh, the Sugar Ray.
- What's a Sugar Ray?
It's when I pretend to be a diabetic kid so the man who is threatening to beat up my father would run off scared.
You see, we did have some good times, didn't we?
Now, come on, let's make a bet.
Here you go.
What's the catch?
What catch?
There is no catch.
What possible catch can there be?
All I want you to do is make a bet.
All right, Pop, you want me to lose your money?
I'll be happy to.
Schmidt.
Robby?
Robby, what are, what are you doing here, man?
- I'm spying on Cece.
- Cece.
You know, I'm still in love with her, so this is pretty much your basic broken-hearted spying thing.
It's why I got this hat.
Aw, come on, Robby, you got to get over that.
Wait a second, are you spying on Cece, too?
No.
What?
- Are you still in love with Cece?
- No, that's still Yes, I am.
It's killing me.
Me, too!
Bring it in, man.
What are you two doing here?
- Whoa, hey.
- Cece?
- Just nothing, we're just - Yeah, you know.
Do you think that she saw me?
What?
Of course she saw you.
Do you think she saw me?
Well, yeah, you don't have a hat on.
Nicky only had one dream when he was a kid-- to own a family horse.
That is so surprising 'cause it just doesn't seem like Nick hates living things, so, like, it just doesn't really seem like in line with what I know about him.
All right, look - I want to buy a horse.
- Uh-huh.
For me and Nick to own together.
- Oh!
- I found this beautiful horse.
- Gorgeous!
- Right.
Me and you are gonna talk the guy down.
I don't know how to do that.
- I'll take care of that.
- Okay.
Hey-ya, Dusty.
Aw, ya gotta be kidding me!
How'd he find me?
Who was that?
Eh, don't worry about him.
What do you know about horses?
I know they're big.
Perfect.
This is a very sad case.
I mean My niece, she goes to veterinary school.
We're all very proud of her.
Top of my class.
So, what do you, uh, what do you think?
Terrible horse.
She's very sickly.
- He.
He He.
- He He.
Oh!
I wish I had brought my stethoscope.
I'm seeing a lot of split ends.
The mane is totally the wrong cut for the shape of his face.
So you're saying that this horse, right now, the way it is, - will never race again?
- Damn it, Uncle Buck!
This horse will never race again!
Why did you fly me all the way out from Grenada if you weren't gonna listen to me?
- Yes, con!
- Shh, shh, shh!
Okay, there are people in life who you want to be unpredictable.
Your pothead neighbor, or Vice President Joe Biden.
And then there are people who you don't want to be unpredictable, like your dentist, or, I don't know, your father.
Look, Nick, my dad left when I was three.
Every single day, rain or shine, he just never came back.
I wish he'd been a little bit more unpredictable; That's all I'm saying.
I hear you.
And yeah, sure, Walt may owe me a couple hundred bucks, but it's not a big deal.
My dad owes you money?
How much?
Three, 400 like 1,100 bucks.
Oh, my God, he's with Jess.
He's gonna rip her off.
He's gonna rip her off.
I feel like Cece's making a big mistake with this Indian guy.
- She should be with somebody like us.
- Totally.
White Guy Power.
Okay, um - Cool Guy Power.
- Now you're talking, Robby.
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.
I mean, one billion Indian men is a daunting foe.
Suddenly I feel sympathy for Pakistan.
But it's like they say, "How do you eat an elephant, Robby"?
With chopsticks.
- What?
- Slowly, with chopsticks.
- That's-- no-- with chopsticks?
!
- In a taco.
- What?
- Elephant tacos.
Elephant tacos?
Who eats elephant tacos?
- That's not even a saying.
- Oh.
One bite at a time, Robby.
- One bite at a time.
- Yes.
One bite at a time.
This is what I'm thinking.
I use my superior powers of manipulation and persuasion to get Cece to take you back.
Once we've neutralized the sub-continental threat, I smite you.
- What?
- What?
You said you're gonna smite me?
Smite-- defeat gloriously for Cece's hand.
- No, I know what it means.
- But that's someday.
For now, let's scheme, my "broheem".
Okay I just want to reiterate that I'm not on board with the smiting.
- Whatever.
- But I like the "broheem" thing a lot.
Let's concentrate on the broheem part.
- Concentrate on okay.
- And smite later.
- Yeah, okay, yeah.
- Cheers, broheem.
You got a great deal.
- Good luck, Doc.
- Thanks.
- Dad!
- Hi, boys.
- Can I tell him?
I would rather keep it a secret.
Nick, your dream finally came true.
We got you a horse.
- It's not my dream to own a horse.
- What?
Did you use my friend to buy a horse?
What?
No, I swore you wanted?
Will you excuse me?
I gotta take this call.
That is unbelievable, Dad.
He had this whole thing-- he was gonna name the horse "A Father's Love" 'cause you guys always wanted to have a horse together.
Tell me you didn't give him money.
Actually, actually, that's a funny story because I'm actually an investor in God!
God!
Walid, drop dead!
Damn, Pop-Pop.
- Stop calling him Pop-Pop!
- Now, listen, I already got people standing by to take the horse off our hands.
Horse semen in Dubai is gold.
No, you can't sell "A Father's Love".
There's more to "A Father's Love" than just semen.
Ew, poetic, but ew.
- Dad.
- Dusty, I see you and we're doing this right now.
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Dusty!
We got your back, Pop-Pop.
Damn, Pop-Pop, man.
Give me that.
Okay, okay, okay!
Father, we got your back, Father.
Five hundred dollars?
You stole $500 from her to buy that horse?
I didn't steal anything from her.
She saw the opportunity for a business investment, and she took advantage of it.
I mean Dad, she will believe anything.
That's not true, Nick.
- My real name is Jamil.
- It is?
No, my name is not Jamil!
- Nick, that was not fair.
- It is Nick, you know that!
You told me in confidence.
How could you think my name was Jamil?
- Well, he's weird.
- That's a good point.
Just wait for one hour.
You see, I go meet the buyer, I sell them our horse for a huge profit, and because these suckers think our horse is Big Brown's nephew, they'll overpay.
Blue Eyes gets her money back with interest.
Sounds like a great plan.
We'll come with you.
And I'll watch you give Jess her money back.
Yeah!
Please, please, don't do this to me.
We're doing it.
No, no, you You don't understand, you're not a sales guy, okay?
He he starts to sweat.
Nick only sweats if there's lying involved.
And there's not lying involved, is there?
We're coming with, Dad.
Check this out.
- We get seersucker suits - Yeah.
And two more guys, and then we serenade her with a barbershop quartet.
Well, if we got ten more guys and a plan, we'd form an Ocean's Twelve.
I would be Brad Pitt, you'd be the crafty Asian fellow - who does the, uh, who does the flippies.
- Oh, I got a great idea.
We can name a star after her, all right?
I know this Web site, and we could put one that's right near the Robbies one through eight.
- You have eight stars?
- There's, like, a billion stars, they're really cheap.
- But eight of them are yours?
- That's only going to go up in value.
It's a horrible investment.
I know she's into that Gandhi crapola.
We could self-immolate.
- I feel like we're so close.
- Wait, Robby.
I got it.
Cool Guy Power!
Cool Guy Power!
Cool Guy Power!
Cool Guy Power!
Cool-- hey.
- Is this happening?
- Yes.
Why are the two of you even together?
Are you wearing a traditional sari?
- Yes.
- I begged you to wear a sari.
I had all these sari-related sexual scenarios.
- Shh!
- "Monsoon Bedding".
"The Best Erotic Mari-bone Hotel".
- Stop that.
- "Slum-Doggy-Style Millionaire" But, what, you're wearing the sari for who?
Let me see this guy.
- No!
What Schmidt!
Robby!
- You're wearing it for him Oh, my God.
- Are you you're having an orgy here?
- Mm-mm.
- This is a big Indian orgy?
- Oh, for God sakes.
- They're all wearing their clothes - I'm telling you, it's an orgy.
Pavun and I can't go on a date until our families meet.
- We saw you on a date earlier.
- That wasn't a date.
I was meeting Pavun's uncle, Manish.
Manish.
That is Pavun.
Oh, that's Pavun.
Oh, my God, look at this guy, he's gorgeous.
What are you talking about?
I don't have a chance here.
Look at his features.
Look at your features, man.
You're just as gorgeous.
I mean, kind of.
You're kind, you always have gum and you've got so much pep.
You know what, You are confident, and you're punctual, and you came up with this awesome plan.
Yeah, we came up with this awesome plan.
- Together.
- You know what, screw it, I don't even care anymore.
White Guy Power!
- That's "white guy".
- All right, man.
Let's do it.
All right.
White Guy Power.
You got to quit it with that, man.
I'm telling you, it's a little racist.
Get out of here before I throw you out.
- All right.
- He is so organized, you know?
I am just I'm learning a ton.
I'm ready for this.
This is good.
This is really exciting.
This is my first middle of the night parking lot horse deal.
This is not gonna work, they're gonna It's gonna work.
It's gonna work.
- Gonna work fine.
- Take control of this, please.
- I got it, I got it.
Yes.
- We got it.
We got it, Walt.
Hey, look, will you do me a favor, please?
Let me handle this.
Just because my dad is in town, I'm not gonna put you in harm's way.
Yup.
Okay.
Twist my arm.
I'll be the lookout.

Weird.
Strange!
You're weird.
Now you have to talk to each other!
You've been conned.
God, I'm good.
That's not a con, Jess!
You're just driving away.
I was ready to get your friend's money back for her, okay?
But you insisted on coming here.
You know what?
You know what's funny about you?
Somehow, you have made this seem like my fault.
This isn't my fault!
I didn't invite you here!
Keep talking.
This is good for you guys.
Are you angry at me about something, Little Penis?
I have been mad at you for 30 years, Dad.
- 30 years?
- I am not a successful adult.
I don't eat vegetables and/or take care of myself.
And it's because of you.
Well, okay, maybe I'll take a little bit of that hit.
Look, it's not "taking a hit".
It's just saying sorry.
I think you look cold.
I'm gonna give you my pants.
- I don't want your pants.
- Come on, take the pants!
- Dad, please don't do that.
- You say I do nothing for you.
- Let me give you my pants.
- I don't want your pants!
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.
Take my pants.
This is making it worse!
Dad, the This is ridiculous.
Okay.
All right, maybe, uh maybe I did make some mistakes along the line, okay?
We all make mistakes, Dad.
Hey, what do you say, tomorrow, we go to a game?
Any game, you pick it out.
I'm in.
You're welcome!
Son of a This thing doesn't turn so well.
Do you think Cece and Pavun will make it?
I don't know.
Really can't say.
What I can say is that one arranged marriage did take place today.
The marriage of Schmidt and Robby.
Hell, yeah.
I only dread the day that we defeat all the Indians, and must face each other in a duel to the death.
Yeah.
Buzz kill.
We're like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.
Except only one of us dies at the end of the movie.
It's gonna be you.
You're the one that's gonna die.
- You want another beer?
- Sure do, compadre.
Hey, Walt.
What are you doing?
I thought you were gonna go to a game with Nick today.
Going to get a bagel.
In Chicago.
No!
No, I can't No.
Um, I can't let you go.
This means too much to Nick.
You can't just say you're gonna do things and then not do them.
- What was that?
- What was what?
- That.
- What?
What?
Damn, you're good.
Listen, Blue Eyes, do me a favor, will ya?
Will you tell him for me that I, uh You know, that I Just keep an eye on him for me, will ya?
Jess, if you're gonna mess with my sink, put some goggles on.
Your eyes are twice the size of normal eyes; It's a bigger target.
Walt's gone.
I know how hard it was for you to talk to him, and I just some people, I just don't under they just-- aah!
And I understand why you want to break pipes now.
Let's just drink a bunch and destroy the sink.
I don't need to break the pipes, Jess; I'm fine.
I mean, truth be told, I was happy to see him.
I thought if you talked to him that maybe No Look, Jess people don't change.
If someone's broken, they just stay broken.
You're not broken.
I'm a little broken.
- No, no, no no.
- Oh, yeah.
You should be so much worse.
Seriously, you could be picking up calls on a banana.
You could be, like, "Hello"?
I don't know how you made it out.
But you're good.
Well, look, there's a lot I don't tell you.
I haven't done laundry in five months.
I'm not wearing underwear.
- I'm just wearing a big sock right now.
- Really.
A big sock.
- A very big sock.
- I got it.
What do you think about this?
We get a three-person canoe, okay?
Then we got to her house and we rap on the door.
She answers the door, she sees the three-person canoe.
She realizes there's only two of us, and we say, "Ah, what a conundrum.
Please join us".
How about this one?
We get some night-vision goggles.
All right, that's all I got.
I don't I don't know what else.
I mean, I would say Trojan horse, but - In this economy?
- I mean, we could always go on a hunger strike.
We enlist in the Navy, we quickly rise through the ranks, - and then we can take her to the Naval Officer's Ball.
- Feel like we're right there!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Oh, Cece.
Are you two kids back together?
- She wishes.
- No, plumbing's out-- severe clogging.
- I'm sorry I asked.
- This is what happens.
Four models with protein deficiencies, sharing a shower.
They shed like a like a four-dollar Christmas sweater.
Guys, guess what?
I just made a breakthrough with a student.
Yeah, it's true.
- Don't, please.
- Uh, Jess?
You know we love you, we all support you I'm breaking through with students.
but when you do things like this, I'm sorry bowl.
Okay.
It's just not satisfying.
- I think it is.
- Okay.
You said you had a breakthrough.
It's just a whole new world teaching adults.
This week, I gave them an assignment.
I said write whatever you want just load it up with descriptive imagery.
My fluffy pillow, my yellowy fluffy pillow, next to my dog, my hairy dog, my beloved hairy dog, while I diddle myself.
Excellent.
He was a merman.
He was the last of his kind, and he needed a mother for his mer-child.
He was not a mer-gentleman.
Can't wait to hear more.
I just can't connect with them and I don't know why.
Look, Jess, you can't teach people how to write.
- Not true.
- I say that as a writer.
- Also not true.
- A writing class is for somebody who doesn't think lyrically in terms of, like, poetic words that just are strung You said you had a breakthrough.
So I have this student whose name is Edgar and he was not getting it.
And then today he turned in this amazing story.
Nick, actually, you should read this.
Writers don't read-- we write.
Jessica Day calls it "A must read".
What is this amateur hour?
At least use Palatino.
Good evening, everyone.
Or should I say morning?
Hey, Winston.
Do you guys have any agave?
We might have some pressed lentil syrup in the mixin's cabinet.
Thank you.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Okay, uh - Okay, you know what?
- Hey, look I just felt the side, the side - anyway, so it's - I didn't mean to It's fine, it's Other way, now.
- I will fight you, Jack.
- No, not again.
Not no!
- No!
- Jump out the way, Jessica?
What the hell is wrong with you just waving that thing around like an idiot?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Guys, listen to this.
"By day, I'm a plumber.
By night, I'm a stalker".
You read it.
"I sit in the bushes wearing a gimp costume, stalking my prey".
He's the first person I got to use first person narrative.
I'm an amazing teacher.
- Very engaging, keep going.
- I'm hooked.
Okay, "My prey is a deer.
"Her eyes are big, too big.
"Before she can blink those big eyes, "I'm stabbing her.
"I stab and stab.
I love stabbing".
Sounds like he likes stabbing.
"After all the stabbing" It's repetitive, but "I wash my hands in her dark red blood"?
!
Listen to that detail.
This man is psychotic.
It's fiction.
There's no such thing as a gimp costume.
- No, gimp costume's a real thing.
- That's a real thing.
You've seen me in one before.
I just don't think you should be in a room with this creep, twice a week.
It is not safe.
Are you worried about me, Miller?
Yeah, I'm a little worried about you.
And if you won't do anything about it, then I'm taking into my own hands.
I'm doing a little investigation.
Investigating?
Please.
You're just gonna Google his name.
I am way beyond that.
You're typing his name into Google.
We can all see the screen.
See the screen, dude.
This is a private investigation!
Are you I wanted to talk to you about the regrettable contact between Cece's her-her down there and my, uh my parts.
You practically shish-kebabbed her.
Is this something I should apologize for?
Just let it go, man.
You pogo'd her.
I'm sorry, what did you say, "pogo"?
- I didn't, um - I heard "Pogo" -- what is that?
Look, Winston, fine.
It's what we call what you did this morning, okay?
It's a short it's a shorthand.
Why do you have a shorthand, Schmidt, because it happens so often?
You pogo'd me once.
- You pogo'd Jess twice.
- Hey, it's not sexual.
Nick's never been pogo'd directly.
You did get his pizza one time which, by the way, is a whole nother debate-- how did you not feel that?
Let me get this straight-- you guys sit around and talk about this?
Your penis actually changed the channel, uh, when we were watching the Bears game once.
You don't think me, Nick and Jess talk about you behind your back?
Because we do.
You have more pogos than anyone.
You are completely misusing the word pogo.
You are the pogo king.
Pogo king.
Pogo king?
So I wanted to talk about your creative imagery assignments.
Wow, guys.
I really felt like I was buried under a giant, gleaming, powdery avalanche of adjectives.
Don't mean to interrupt, I just hear you're the best - teacher of adults?
- Oh, no.
- I wonder if there's room for one more?
- No!
How you guys doing?
I'm Julius Pepperwood.
- Not now, okay?
- I'm an ex-cop, ex-Marine.
I'm here to learn how to write short fiction.
Oh, okay, Julius, just take a seat and, um, keep small.
I'm from Chicago.
Thin-crust pizza?
No, thank you.
I'm from Chicago.
So, for a fun follow-up - Sorry, I'm late.
- No, problem, Edgar.
We're just going over our - descriptive imagery.
- I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.
Mr. Pepperwood?
I'm gonna move closer, if you don't mind.
No, you don't have to go stay over there.
How you doing, pal?
- I'm Julius Pepperwood.
- Edgar.
What are you doing?
If you don't mind me asking, why are you late today, Edgar?
Uh, traffic, it really killed me.
- It killed you?
- Mr. Pepperwood.
Would you say that it stabbed you?
Say that again?
How about glasses on or off?
Teach, if I keep them on, - am I a bad boy?
- Hey.
All right, honey, I'll take them off.
Whoa, that's a whole different lens to see that blue dress.
No.
Okay, let's refocus.
Um, let's talk about the, um, four classifications of conflict.
We talked about it last week.
It's in the workbook, um Anybody want to help me?
Four classifications of conflict?
Anybody?
Anybody So, no one has signed up for office hours and I just want you to know that you can talk to me about anything.
- Adios.
- Anything at all.
What are you doing?
Nothing, man, you look good in your Dockers.
What?
Nothing happened.
I'm Julius Pepperwood.
Let it go.
Whoops.
- Why did you do that?
- The wind.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Is everything all right?
Yeah, everything's good.
Oh, everything's fine, bro.
What's happening right now?
Sorry, Edgar, um, I really loved your story.
Um, I wanted to give you some notes-- is there any time you could come in to office hours?
Yeah, that be really cool.
I'm really excited.
Um, I'm available anytime, so - I'll check my calendar.
- Yup.
Can't get service around here.
Wednesday I got to go to the bird store.
Uh, what about Wednesday afternoon?
He's my uncle.
Hey, Winston, I'm glad you're home.
I know what my pogo is.
It's that I dance kind of like a sea snake.
Yeah, not even close, Schmidt.
What are you talk I know this it, man.
Is it that I barge into people's showers?
It's my caterpillar eyebrows-- well, look.
They're gone.
Nick, you've gone way too far!
Way too far.
Well, if you're here for Edgar's notebook, you're too late.
Where's the notebook?
Nick!
What's my one rule?
It's to not steal your yarn.
Don't steal my yarn, man.
It's my one thing.
But look at what was inside of his notebook.
Okay, he was doodling in class, Nick.
Weapons, dripping with blood?
That is not a doodle.
What are you, the doodle police?
- There's no doodle police, are there?
- Really?
I can't believe you still don't believe me.
Jessica Exhibit D. He did this.
I'm going to Edgar's house, I'm looking for more proof.
No, Nick, you're not spying on the one student that I have a connection with.
- I have the address right here.
- No.
- Give me the - No!
- I have the address memorized.
- Fine, then I'm coming, too.
To bail you out of jail when you get arrested for trespassing.
- Fine, then you'll see that I was right.
- Fine!
And you'll also see who gets there first.
Maybe we should take one car.
Just, like, for the environment.
Yeah, that makes sense-- we can drive together.
- Fine!
- Fine!
It's my mole, isn't it?
Well, consider it gone.
Game, set, pogo.
Chill out, man, it's not your mole.
Just tell me, this is the worst.
This is not the worst, Schmidt-- the worst is actually knowing.
Knowing that your friends sit around every single night talking about your pogo.
What's a pogo?
Those brows don't freak you out?
Nah, I've seen worse.
A pogo is what your friends talk about when you leave the room.
Oh, like your barnacle toenails?
Uh sh You guys talk about my toenails?
Never talk about your toenails, Sch Schmidt.
I know my toenails are a little rugged.
Woodsy.
I mean, I have never wondered if you could shimmy up a palm tree.
But it's because I have a keratin surplus, I mean They're not that bad, look at these things.
- Aah!
Schmidt!
- Ew!
It looks like an open Swiss Army knife.
Most of them are hard, but one of them is really, really soft.
I know, I know, I know-- we'll just talk about what my pogo is.
What's my pogo?
Is it the way I say "pan"?
Pan, pan, pan.
Look, Cece, this is more of just a loft thing.
Just thank your lucky stars that you don't have calcified mongrel toes!
Things sound like a dang ol' crab.
There it is.
If anything's gonna go down, we need a safe word.
Nothing's gonna go down unless we make it go down.
- If Pepperwood taught me anything-- - There's no Pepperwood.
Never get caught without a safe word.
We're gonna go with "apricot".
That's way too normal.
We need to, like, go with something weird, like "dragon slippers".
- What?
- I use "apricot" too much in my normal life.
Why do you use "apricot" so much?
What am I supposed to call them-- "sweet tangy balls"?
Don't call them "sweet tangy balls," Jessica.
Well, that's why we can't use Nick Nick Nick, oh!
Shh!
Come on - Nick..
- Call me Julius Pepperwood, please.
You look ridiculous.
If we're hiding from people, - why does it matter what I call you?
- I got my eyes - and you get my six.
- No, no, what does this mean?
- I'm pretty sure this - This means "right turn bicycle".
- No, I'm pretty sure this means "stop - " It means "right turn".
Nick, seriously-- use your words.
- Don't use freaking SWAT sign language.
- Okay, these are my words.
Oh!
Apricot, apricot, apricot.
Close your mouth, close your eyes.
Edgar lives with his mother.
Of course he does.
So?
A lot of normal people live with their mothers.
Like my Uncle Randy.
- He can't go near parks.
- He was cleared.
You've got to Apricot!
Apricot!
Get over here now!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
What's in that duffel bag?
He's the plumber from the story.
- How did I not see this before?
- What was I saying?
- Oh, my God, you were right.
- Yes, say that again, - say that again.
You were right, you were right, you were right about everything.
- Don't ever forget you're saying it!
- Oh, my God, - I can't believe you were right.
- I was a right about everything!
What the hell is in that duffel bag?
- I don't know.
- No, Nick.
- Nick, you're gonna get us killed.
- Let's get down.
Nick Nick Shh.
I'm so excited Oh, my Jessica, turn it off.
- Turn it off!
Oh, my God, it's Edgar.
- What do I do?
You turn it Here.
- Turn it off.
I don't know how to do this.
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Get the hell out of here.
Jess, what are you doing?
That is ridiculous.
There was plenty of room.
It seemed like a good idea.
Why would you go under a van?
Let's leave.
Keep still You will not believe what just happened.
- Nick was right.
- I was right.
Oh, my God, what happened to your eyebrows?
You look like Audrey Hepburn.
Don't we own an industrial-size paper cutter?
- Ugh!
- Oh, whatever.
- What the hell is that?
- So close to the eating area!
Winston told me that you guys make fun of my gremlin toenails.
That you call them "clickety- clacks" or "centaur boots".
What is wrong with you, Winston?
What is wrong with me?
Besides my pogo.
I told him.
It just kind of popped out.
You understand what that's like, right, Winston?
Okay, you know what?
Don't act like we don't talk about you two behind your backs.
Because we do.
You both have pogos, my friends.
Okay, let's take a deep breath and ask ourselves if this conversation is worth ruining our friendships over.
Tell me my pogo.
I need to know my pogo.
You guys need to tell me.
I can take it.
Lay it on me!
You know, it's kind of a loft thing.
Is it my pies?
Are they too tart?
Pies can't be a pogo, okay?
My koala claws, now that's a pogo!
At least you can hide your pogo in a shoe.
They make shoes for your penis-- they're called pants!
- Tell me my pogo.
- Jessica, no.
- Tell me my pogo!
- You're a know-it-all!
- Huge know-it-all.
- The worst.
Oh, I'm the worst know-it-all in the world?
Please.
Hate hyperbolic speak.
Please.
Now you know your pogo, you truly know it all.
There I go being a smart-ass again.
I mean, that, that could be my pogo.
And then there was one.
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sure that you guys have stuff you laugh at me behind my back.
We don't laugh about your pogo, Nick.
Yeah.
We're worried about you.
You're worried about me?
We're worried that you're not gonna make it.
- Make it to what?
- Just in general.
'Cause you don't take care of yourself.
Sometimes I'll crumple up vitamins and I'll put them in your food.
We all take turns sneaking money into your pants pockets before we put them in the dryer.
Yeah?
Well, I hope you're happy.
The pogos are out.
The loft dynamic is ruined.
But what if I talk like a baby?
You're still hot.
That's all we're gonna talk about.
A tiny little baby!
Cut into these, please.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh!
A ladder That'll do.
Okay, okay.
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is this is very bad.
Oh, no, oh, no-- no, no- no-no-no-no-- oh, God, oh, God.
I'm so excited Hello.
- Jess, he wants to kill you!
- What?
- I am in his shed right now - What?
And there are drawings on the wall of you, and bloody weapons and googly eyes.
Googly eyes are actually kind of sexy, but that's beside Jess, I will not let you be in a room alone with this guy.
You're the deer in his story.
He wants to kill you.
You're the deer, you're the deer, you're the deer.
I'm at school and I'm doing office hours Get out now!
Okay, I'll just, I'll just keep you on the line, and then I'll say the safe word, okay?
I'll just say it like Apricots!
Apricots!
Good.
Yeah, yeah, that's what you say if you see Edgar.
Apricots!
Really, apricots!
Oh, no.
Okay, okay, stop it.
He's there.
Okay.
I thought it was gonna be "dragon slippers".
Is this a bad time or?
No, no, no, no.
I just have a deaf grocer.
Apricots!
Apricots!
And butter.
I'm coming.
Oh!
Ho-ho!
Welcome to office hours.
Um - I found my ending.
- Yeah?
It's pretty risky.
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get away with it.
Oh!
Remember when you told me to base my characters on people from my own life?
Well, I based one on you.
- So flattered.
- And then I realized that there was only one way for the story to end.
You need to die.
Apricot, apricot.
No!
Hey!
Uh, uh-uh-uh!
Look at that notebook.
You said, "Great literature is surprising".
What's more surprising than killing your main character?
What about this-- go with me-- what if, um, what if my character lives and the book just goes on?
Imagine coming to the end of the book, and then just finding a lot more book.
Surprise.
- I'm so excited - Um, oh.
- And I just can't hide it - I heard that song yesterday.
This song is everywhere these days.
Were you at my house?
- Okay, thank you.
Good-bye.
- No.
- No!
No!
- I have to go right now.
Apricot's leaving!
Apricot's leaving!
Oh, good.
I'm so happy you're alive.
Okay, stay inside and lock the door.
I am coming.
I am going to protect you Nick?
!
Pepperwood!
Nick!
?
Burglar?
!
He's not a burglar.
He's Julius Pepperwood from Chicago.
Let's get him in the house.
The D.A.'s gonna have my badge for this.
No!
Get off of him!
You kill him, you kill me, too!
Get away from my Edgar!
My eyes!
Oh!
My giant eyes!
You thought I was a murderer?
You thought I was a murderer of people?
You said you were gonna kill me, so I don't know.
Your character in my graphic novel.
- He's an excellent artist.
- Okay, but your drawings, they don't have any eyes.
- Hate drawing eyes.
It's weird.
- He can't draw eyes.
There's a reason for everything.
What about the duffel bag?
Don't ask about the duffel bag!
Bitch.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Whoa!
Hey, man.
Hey, take this as a compliment, pal.
Your stories are so real.
Well, it's because what you taught me.
You listened?
Well, of course I listened.
You were a good teacher.
Until you thought I was a murderer and you broke into my shed.
Aw!
You were my favorite student until I thought you were a murderer.
- Ah - Your son's a really great writer.
- He's not my son.
- Oh!
Are you kidding?
!
Really?
!
Real nice, you two.
Come here, baby.
Mm!
God, you smell like waffles.
I love it.
Did you just make some waffles?
- Want to eat me up?
- Yes, I do.
I'll meet you inside.
I'm gonna get the duffel bag.
- Yes, do.
- Okay.
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.
What are you doing up?
Just taking care of myself.
Are you putting butter on bacon?
I don't want it to stick to the pan.
Okay, did you?
Great.
It's just what bacon needs, more fat.
And salt.
- What's this?
- Don't read that.
I'm not finished "Julius Pepperwood: Zombie Detective"?
All his murder victims are already dead, so they obviously don't need a detective.
I'm working on it.
- "The night was inky hot".
- Don't do this.
"She strode into his office with a sense of purpose, place, another word here, question mark".
I'm looking for another "P" word there.
"She had zombie legs that went on for miles.
"They were the kind of legs you could sink your teeth into.
"Pepperwood had two friends-- one, if you count his hat.
The other was his gal Friday, Jessica Night".
It's not you, Jess.
"She was small in stature, but not in spunk.
And a super annoying know-it-all".
Good evening.
Hello.
Oh, bacon.
Where the hell did you come from?
I came from my room.
No, I didn't hear the pitter- patter of your disgusting feet.
I cut my toenails.
Yeah, the soaking really worked.
Look at that.
They're gorgeous now.
- Went down a full shoe size.
- Guys!
Fire!
- Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, my God!
Everybody relax!
Call a fireman!
- You call the fireman!
- I'm the fireman.
You can't put out a grease fire with water!
You have to smother it!
Why didn't you say that before?
!
I don't want to be a know-it-all!
- You're so stupid!
- Shut up!
- Whoo!
Oh!
- Nice!
Yes!
Amazing, my man!
Whoa.
Whoa.
Honestly, I didn't know you were gonna put your arm around me.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, you put up your pup tent in front of the fire.
It's involuntary.
It is a combination of adrenaline and great circulation.
And I'd appreciate it if you don't just hug me randomly!
That's weird and!
You ever notice when Winston runs, - that he kinda farts while he's running?
- Yes!
- Sounds like a jalopy.
- New pogo.
Oh, we got a great new pogo!
He farts when he runs!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Ah!
Look how handsome I look.
That is a woman's coat.
This coat has clean lines and pockets that don't quit.
And it has room for your hips.
And when I wear it, I feel hot to trot.
- You're wearing a dress.
- Yeah, don't say "hot to trot".
My coat makes me say things like that.
First of all, Nick, it is not your coat.
True, it was delivered to the wrong address.
But then tell me, why does it fit like a damn glove?
What is happening to you, man?
I don't know if I can give up looking this damn good-- It's someone else's woman's coat.
Nothing?
I mean, nothing?
Damn it!
I've been trying to get something going with myself for a full hour.
It's like a taffy pull on a hot summer's day.
Eww!
You have the door open, Schmidt.
I'm over myself-- I just don't do it for me anymore.
I even bought myself a sexy pair of underpants to spice things up-- didn't happen.
I just laid there.
You know what?
That's it.
Tonight, I start having sex again.
Now, are you two gonna join me?
- Not while I'm here, please.
- Is that the way you wanted to say that?
I'm in, Schmidty!
I am in!
I'm gonna have sex tonight.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
I like this feeling, you guys.
I'm liking the vibe that we got going here.
There's definitely gonna be some sex-having tonight.
- Oh, yeah - Damn it, there needs to be.
You know I haven't had sex since Labor Day?
I know what the problem is-- I want it too bad.
So, what's your name?
Winst W-W-W yeah.
You just need a confidence boost.
Good news-- I'm lousy with the stuff I got your back tonight.
And you, London Fog, you're looking hot to trot, baby.
- Any chance you're gonna take that coat off?
- This jacket?
No way.
- I'm keeping the jacket on.
- Take the jacket off.
- No, I'm keeping the jacket on.
- No, it's fine.
- Band of brothers.
- Band of brothers, yeah!
The club's up Dance, dummy.
Hey, guys.
Guess what?
Sam has the late shift and Cece's on a date with some Indian guy, so world's best wing-woman reporting for duty.
Jess, you can't come.
- What?
- Look, I actually want to get girls tonight.
You're my cooler.
What?
All I do is help you get laid, Nick.
Maureen, did you have one very special long-time love?
Yes.
You should be with him.
I'm not your cooler.
It's not you.
It's the way that you behave.
And the things that you say.
And the look on your face.
And It is you.
It's just you-- you're the cooler.
I'm sorry, but you can't come with us tonight.
I get it.
Um I just I have, um, a lot of things I have to do.
More important stuff to do here.
I have to clean out my closet and - Oh, yeah.
- I have an ice cream maker to try out.
That's better than going to a stupid club.
- It's gonna be awesome.
It's gonna be great.
- Shut up.
Get out of here, girl, you're missing nothing.
- It's gonna get so crazy.
- Come on, buddy, get in there.
Get crunk with us, bro.
Yeah-ha-ha!
Yeah!
I can't believe you got us kicked out of the discotheque, Nick.
- I didn't even do anything.
- Damn it, Nick, take the coat off, all right?
It freaks girls out.
Well, maybe they're freaked out 'cause you're not wearing a trench coat.
- Yeah?
Have you ever thought of that?
- Okay, guys, please-- no more friendly fire.
- All right.
- Okay.
Ooh, Schmidty type.
That's a Schmidty type right there.
That's me.
Yeah, yeah.
Schmidty time I feel good.
Yeah.
Schmidty time.
- Schmidt!
Hey, dude!
- What?
!
What about band of brothers?
Your friendship means nothing to me.
Every man for himself.
- Hey, uh - Hey.
I was, uh Most M-M Okay Yeah, can you - In the beginning - Tap out, man.
Tap out.
What happened to building my confidence, Schmidty?
You went in too soon.
Get out of here.
- Go.
- Go.
- Hey.
- What's happening?
Hi.
Wow, that was embarrassing.
Yeah Well..
You can relax.
I'm taken.
You were very beautiful from across the bar.
I'm sorry.
I'm Schmidt.
I'm sorry we were talking, Schmidt.
What a ten, what a beautiful woman.
He works here.
As a bartender.
Yeah, I do.
February clean-out.
What do you think, Nick?
I'm bored!
No bottoms, no bottoms.
Bottoms on top!
Robot can't find clothes to fit right.
Robot can't find clothes.
I do it for Kenya.
Silver?
!
Damn you, Zimbabwe.
Hello?
Hello?
Nice coat you got there.
Well, I just actually wear it 'cause it gives me confidence.
That's kind of sad.
You know what's really sad is that he stole the jacket.
It's not technically stealing.
He's still reeling from being dumped.
- Aw.
- He's attached to it.
Like a little bitch "bwanky".
It's not like a blanky, dude.
- It looks like a "bwanky".
- It's not like my "bwanky".
The only reason I'm out tonight is to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid.
That's not true.
I'm not gonna Shut up, Schmidt.
I mean, I could take care of you, - if you wanted.
- You can what?
I love sad guys and you seem sadder than most.
I think your plan sounds okay.
When you go home at night, do you look in the mirror and just think, "I am the worst"?
- Actually yes, I do.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a lot of the times.
- You hate yourself?
I definitely don't like myself.
It's right on the line of hate.
What the hell is this?
I don't know how to talk to women.
Reason being, I feel like you all think that I just want one thing from you.
- Mm-hmm.
- I want the one thing.
But a bunch of other th can a man just want all the things?
I mean, damn.
I like a challenge.
And you are one big challenge.
I'm Daisy.
Winston.
Sam, it's Jess.
Please come get me.
I'm probably fine, but I also might be dead.
Good-bye.
It's Cece, leave a message.
Cece, it's Jess-- call me back, I'm alone in the loft.
I think there's something out There's something sexy about a man who just needs me to make him feel better.
I honestly need you to make me feel better.
- Nicholas, your phone's ringing.
- Not now, Schmidt!
- Hey, Jess.
It's Jess.
- Schmidt, stop.
- You should really talk to her.
- Unbelievable.
I am so sad.
Nicholas, you have a phone call.
Don't do this, Schmidt, please don't.
You are the dumbest Would you wait one second?
I'm just I just have to do this.
- I'll be sad in a second.
- Yep.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm sad.
- Okay.
Uh, what is going on?
There's something at the door and you have to come home.
Cooler, Jess-- you are being a cooler right now.
Seriously, I think it might be gang related.
I've always been worried about my blue curtains Crips.
- The Cri Jess, I'm done!
- Nick, I need you.
Yeah, so this is the place.
I'm really glad you're here.
The bedrooms are that way What are you doing, pal?
Never leave me alone again.
I'd like to introduce you to our roommate Jess.
Welcome to our home.
Jess, this loft has old pipes-- I've told you that a million times, but you never listen during pipe talk.
Well, pipe talk's boring.
- What is this?
- What is what?
You drew my face on a melon?
What else was I supposed to draw your face on?
Nothing.
Don't draw my face.
- Okay.
- Jess, for some reason, that girl out there, she is sexually aroused by other people's misery.
Do you understand the position that puts me in?
It puts you in a really good position?
It really does.
And then what happens?
Okay, I understand how, in this instance, I might have cooled things off for you.
- Thank you for admitting that.
- I am prepared to fix it.
'Cause, son, I'm gonna get you laid.
Okay, it's not how it is and never call me "son" and don't talk like that.
The game is True American Clinton rules.
Pick your interns.
- I don't understand the game.
- Uh, you're gonna be my intern.
It's okay, it's stripping.
It's not just stripping, it's sexy.
Okay, so what exactly are the rules?
- The floor is lava, doves versus hawks.
- The couch is the Mason-Dixon line.
We're not doing cabinets-- no cabinets.
- No cabinet.
- No cabinets.
One, two, three, four, JFK!
FDR!
Go, go-- that's the lava!
- Down, down in the tunnel.

Holly, you're in the Amber Waves of Grain.
You have to lose your jacket.
- I - Take off your jacket; She's right.
Those are the rules.
Is there, like, a printout of the rules I can see, or?
- No!
- No!
I thought this was like music Howard Dean Scream.
Yeah!
God I am sorry I was crying so much.
God, that film, it just it just reminded me how much I want to have kids, you know?
Was that just a really weird thing - to say on a first date?
- No.
Are you sure?
It felt a bit weird.
Oh, my best friend has texted me, like, 12 times.
I get it-- you're just trying to get out of the date.
- No, no, no-- no, this is real.
- It's the kids thing.
I knew it.
Some psycho keeps scratching at her door and then running away.
She's pretty sure it's the Calabasas Scratcher.
- I mean, is that a thing?
- What?
I don't keep up with local news.
I don't know, it's fine.
You don't have to lie to me.
- I get it.
- You can come with me.
Okay?
Then you'll see.
- Well, all right.
- She's just like this.
Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!
- Schmidt, Schmidt, Schmidt!
- Gettysburg, Bull Run.
Oh, no, oh, no, I think I fell-- oh, no.
In the course of human events, you must Surrender your shirt!

- What do you mean, man?
I took my shirt off!
Wait!
It's part of the game, you guys!
Up, up, up.
I'm up!
Oh, wow!
This footstool really reminds me of my ex.
Liar!
Holly, Holly, look at these-- these are my abs.
Hard to believe that I used to be a great big fat person.
Oh, fat makes me so sad.
Yeah, it makes me sad, too.
I'm chubby I'm a fat guy.
- You look great, man.
- I'm a fat boy.
- Feel where the fat used to be?
- Yeah.
Yeah, it's been replaced with phantom fat.
I still feel it jiggle.
Hey, Schmidt, your butt just violated the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act1 Westward Ho, son!
Westward Ho.
- Bye-bye, Schmidt.
- Damn it.
Come on, all you got to do is talk to her, what's the big deal?
Okay, mm You're at the bar-- I'm Holly.
Boy, am I thirsty.
I was wondering if, like if you want if you want, per chance, like "Per chance," really?
Hm?
No, it's, uh - You're a swell kind of gal.
- Getting worse.
You come on out to the bar.
Hey, girl, what your name is?

- Please.
- Um - Yeah, take a sip.
Okay, look, I think you're amazing.
Would you like to have a drink with me?
Yes, yes, I will.
Now give me that.
This coat is an unfair advantage-- take it off.
I love the coat.
Take the coat off!
Hey, Schmidt!
Hey, hey!
No!
Order!
Order!
All right, there's only one way to solve this.
Two of us have to go behind the Iron Curtain, which is that door there, and kiss.
And there has to be a "clear - and present threat of tongue".
- This is why I voted for you.
- Holly, you ready for this?
- Definitely against the president's order.
- Ready?
- Let's do the count.
The two, three or four.
So when we do this, do two.
Okay.
Not three, not one, not four-- two.
A one or a three.
Anything but a two.
Just not a two.
Two.
Do you hear me?
Two.
Not four.
One, two, three.
What are you doing?

You think?
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Kiss!
Okay, we kissed.
Let us out.
Sent you a picture.
That ain't no kiss, man!
Come on, Inspector Gadget, inspect those tonsils.
Just give Jess a tender, sensual kiss, and we will let you right out.
- Shut up, Schmidt!
- Schmidt, stay out of this!
Please stop yelling at me!
You know that I'm ten percent more emotionally fragile than Nick right now.
No, no, don't!
No, please!
Don't!
Don't!
Do you mind if I tell you a story?
- Is it sad?
- Holly, he's really happy!
He's got a 401K and a six-pack!
Well, it's the tale of an uber successful marketing executive's journey - I'm hairy and chubby!
- into heartbreak.
Mm-hmm.
Her name was Cecelia.
No!
Come on, come on.
Holly, wait!
Ugh!
What is the big deal?
Let's just suck it up and French a little.
Okay, fine, but don't say "Let's suck it up and French a little".
Okay, fine.
Let's do this.
What were you doing?
!
Well, I thought you're sitting on the ground.
- No.
I Okay.
- Uh!
Okay, Jess, hey, this is not a big deal.
Okay, not a big deal.
Let's just do it.
- Fine.
Let's just do it.
- Okay.
Great, yeah.
Let's just do it.
Okay, cool.
Why are you licking your lips?
- Should I not?
Do you want dry lips?
- No.
Then I'm just licking 'em to make 'em better.
- Okay.
- Fine.
- Do it.
- I'm doing it.
Fine, then do it.
Are you a tongue-er?
- Am I a tongue-er?
- I don't want to put my tongue in your mouth, if you don't like it.
Just kiss me!
Okay, all right, great.
- That's what I'm gonna do.
- All right.
Ready?
Yeah.
One, two I'm actually not gonna do a count.
- Okay.
- That's not my style when I kiss.
- I don't count down before - Okay.
- I don't think so.
- Okay.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- I'm sorry.
You can't do that.
- What did I do?
- Your face.
- My face?
Yeah, you can't do that with your face.
Okay, I'll do something different with my face.
Okay, all right, great.
Wait-- you can't kiss with your teeth!
Okay, I can't-- no, I can't do this.
Well, you can't try to kiss me like a Joker and expect Okay, you're let me out of here!
Let me out!
Sometimes, I hear her name when the wind blows.
Please!
Open the door!
Cece.
You know, I left something behind in the desert that day: My faith and true love and my future biracial child.
You, you kind of lost me there.
Not really doing it for me.
It's more depressing than sad.
- It's not depress - It's depressing.
- It's sort of depressing.
- No, no, no, it's not depressing.
It's not really doing it for me.
I'm gonna tell you why it's not depressing.
Because she is still in love with me.
I'm over it completely.
Having said that, it's so hard to move on.
- Do-do you know what I mean?
- Yes.
- Can you help me move on, Holly?
- You need help moving.
- Can you heal my pain?
- I can heal your pain.
- Can you ple - I can heal you.
Yeah, you can heal my Hey, Jess?
Where's Jess?
Jess, where are you?
I came as fast as I can.
- Cece, open the door!
- Cece, don't worry!
I'm just trapped - I need to kill Schmidt!
- Until I kiss Nick!
- What?
- You're the She's the Cece?
Right there, in the flesh.
You are obsessed!
Cece, honey, you have to move on, okay?
You can't love somebody forever.
I'm sorry.
You love that small shiny man?
- No!
- What do you mean, small, man?
None of this is true.
No, because I'm on a date.
Should we make out to make him jealous or something?
Are you lying to me?
I really hate being lied to.
I would never lie to you.
I haven't lied to you this whole time we've been in this loft-- that's a fact.
- Cece, uh - Hey.
please tell me, in front of Holly, how much you still love me.
I'm sorry.
Is this why we came here?
- Please, I don't really know what that accent is.
- English.
I speak English.
That didn't sound like English.
It will be my final request, I promise, so both of us can move on.
- 'Cause I, you know, I'd really like to move on.
- I get it.
- I'd like to move on all night long with Holly.
- Okay, I get it.
I'm only gonna say this one more time.
I always have and always will love you.
All right, all right, you know, this is the most elaborate way to get out of dating me that I've ever experienced, so Winny, it's Nicky.
Open the door, man!
- I guess the game's over.
- I thought we were working together.
I was gonna start on your confidence and work my way up to your facial hair.
What's your fiancÃ© gonna say about that?
Oh, this?
I just wear it so guys don't hit on me in bars.
Okay.
I'm single.
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do.
Okay, I'm waiting.
- Um, so - Still waiting.
Don't say anything!
She sounds weird!
Just let us out!
- Just open the door.
- Yeah.
C minus.
You kiss like a damn bitch.
- Oh, you're messing with me; Okay.
- Little bit.
Nick, I'm gonna admit it.
I might be your cooler.
I chalk it up to bad timing.
Well, thank you for admitting that.
But to be fair, you are your own cooler Some basic grooming, Nick, and you'd be smoking hot.
I'd be smoking hot?
You'd be smoking hot.
You do want to kiss me, then.
All bets are off if you take a shower.
That is very nice of you.
Jess, are you okay?
I got your message!
What's happening?
- Sam, I'm so sorry.
Yeah here, - I'll help you up.

Yes, we will.
But first I'm gonna go do stuff with a girl.

- I'm glad you're okay.
I'm fine.

Can you believe that?
I'm an idiot.
Well, he's missing out.

Me, too.
Let's see here.
Oh, sweet.
Ten e-mails.
Hey, Sam, um I have to tell you something.
How do you always look so beautiful in the morning?
Sometimes I can't even look at you.
I can't even-- I got to look away.
I can't even look at you right now.
Wait, but I got to.
Now I got to look away.
I just can't resist.

It was nothing.
Jess?
Nick kissed me.
Wha?

Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Oh, man.
Okay.
I had the best sex of my life last night.
Winston, I'm glad you're here.
We need to talk.
Yeah.
Daisy said I was pretty good.
You hear that?
Pretty good!
This is important.
And I ain't even use my hands.
You didn't use your hands?
Well, just I did a lot of side stuff.
Okay, Winston, you're killing me.
I really need to talk to you, and now after hearing that, I can barely look at you.
Well, I got my mojo back, baby!
I'm the Mojo Man!
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.

I can't tell Sam!
I didn't even do anything wrong!
Nick kissed me!
I didn't even kiss him back!
Okay, fine!
I kissed him back!
Is that what you want me to say?
I literally haven't said a word for, like, over an hour.
And now he won't even talk to me, 'cause I saw him this morning and he just panic moonwalked away from me.
- He what?
- He does that sometimes.
Man.
Terrorism.
And then ha!
Nick just He just Kisses you.
Stupid Nick Miller.
How was it?
Was it?
I was like Scarlett O'Hara in my freaking curtain dress How did he do it?
- He just, like, grabbed me.
- Uh-huh.
- And he just took me.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, he was a man and I was a woman.
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
- It was firm, but tender.
- Oh, damn.
- Yeah, I mean, I saw thorough space and time for a minute, but that's not the point.
Oh, man!
Are you okay?
I miss sex!
I've been on dates set up by my mother for the past month.
- Mm.
- I mean, what are you gonna do?
I mean, do you like Nick?
Ah!
Bah!
Mm-hmm.
Nah!
Neh?
Nick?
No.
I don't like Nick.
- Mm-hmm.
- I like Sam, 'cause Sam's the kind of guy who fixes things that you didn't even know were broken.
And Nick is the type of guy who breaks things that are He breaks things!
Look at that.
It's for my grandma.
Wow, that's oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What are you-- Nick!
- No, let me just - Nick, Nick, what are you?
- Okay, here, it's fine.
- No!
Nick, what are you?
I think those belong back on it.
He is not getting in the way of me and Sam.
He is not ruining this.
- Mm.
- So mad at him.
I can't even be around him.
Can I just spend the day with you?
Oh.
Well, um Okay, I didn't tell you this before, actually, but, uh Cece is going to an Indian marriage convention today to find herself a brown husband.
Now, little does she know that I have signed up for the same convention.
Gentlemen, there is nothing that says white men need not apply.
You look like the fortune teller in Big.
Wait a second, is it in the loft?
Yes, Nick.
The West Coast's premiere Indian singles event, where 300 eligible Rajput Indians get together to see if they should get arranged-married to each other, is in our loft.
So if it's not, then I'm coming with.
I'm in, Schmidty.
You finally got company.
- I'm coming.
Let's do it.
- The Mojo Man is in, too.
Mojo Man, Mojo Man.
Okay, neither of you are coming.
I've been studying up for a full week.
I can actually speak conversational Hindi.
"Hello".
"Hello".
"Samosa"?
"Yes, please, Samosa".
"More towels"?
"Do you know where the white person's toilet is"?
After that, it gets very confusing.
Can you drive in that dress?
You're right, I can't.
- All right, you're driving.
Let's go.
- Yeah!
Hi, I'm-I'm checking in.
My name's Cecilia Parikh.
This is my best friend.
She's just, she's just here to watch.
All must participate.
We've had a lot of trouble with watchers.
You participate or you go home.
All right, you know what?
What the hell.
You're going to have to fill out a questionnaire.
Information, education, resume.
Done.
Thank you.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
You look like a character from The Love Guru.
Aw, thank you.
Hello.
I'd like to check in with my two friends here.
Look, we are not Indian, but you cannot turn us away, because I read the Website vigorously, kumari.
- Oh, God.
- That means "miss".
My friend right there?
Yeah, he's a vakeel.
That means "lawyer".
I dropped out of ka-heel school.
It's vakeel, man.
What are you doing here?
Oh, no.
I just-- uh, yeah Oh!
Nick, you're embarrassing me.
Nick, what are you doing?
Nick, Nick.
N-N-N-Nick, what are you doing?
Stop moonwalking, man.
Man, you have been weird all morning.
Hey, look, I kissed Jess.
Say what you're gonna say.
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Whoo!
I thought that's what you were gonna say.
I don't want a new roommate.
Look, don't She's not moving out.
I'm not talking about her.
Hell no, not her!
I'm talking about you.
When this thing blows up in your face-- and it will blow up in your face, Nick-- you're the one moving out.
You think I like living with you?
You have centipedes living under your bed!
- Those weren't centipedes.
- You've named your testicles, - and they're both named Sharon.
- Yeah, so what?
I can't believe you kissed Jess!
Man, what were you thinking?
Look, man, I wasn't thinking anything.
Nick, just apologize and make it right, all right?
All right.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Oh, Sharon!
- Get!
Just - Get?
Get over here now.
Wait.
What?
You told me you had moved on.
Only people who haven't moved on say things like that.
I'm a squirrel.
You're my nut.
Winter's coming.
I'm gonna store you in my cheek, girl.
Please leave.
You and I not being together does not make sense to me.
I miss your body and the things I used to do to it.
- Schmidt.
- I'm talking about sex.
Today is about me finding someone within my own culture that I can build my life with.
It's about more than sex.
Our sex was about more than sex.
It was about history and memory and thousands of years of colonial suffering all being released in one moment of pure ecstasy.
Then why did the sex always end with you yelling, "Blammo, that happened"?
Blammo.
Thank you.
Hey.
Oh, you can walk normally now, I see.
I'm sorry I kissed you.
Well, oh, wow.
That was unexpected.
Thanks, Nick.
- You know what, it was a mistake.
- I feel better.
- 'Cause, yeah, I was feeling awkward.
- Yeah, good.
Right.
You were acting a little bit weird, but honestly, for me, it was, like, a nothing kiss.
You know, it was like kissing a cousin.
It was so nonsexual and nothing.
Well I think it meant something.
You know, to you, 'cause you kissed me.
Mm-mm.
I think you can admit it meant something to you, Nick.
Oh, no, I-I'm telling you, it meant nothing to me.
- I think it did.
- No, no.
I do things I don't mean all the time.
Like this.
You see this?
Bottle of water.
Why did I do that?
I don't know.
It doesn't mean anything.
I think you can admit that it meant something to you.
- Hey, Jessica, it didn't.
- Hmm.
It was a drinking game, and I was finishing the game.
Yeah, but it happened after the game when it meant something.
- Oh, so it meant something to you?
- What?
- It meant something to you.
- No, don't If you think some stupid, terrible kiss - You're thinking about it right now!
- No!
- I'm calling Sam and - Oh, you're calling Sam right now?
He's gonna come here and pick me up, - and, uh, we're leaving.
- Oh, you are?
Why are you running away?
Because it meant something?
We're not going anywhere.
Meant nothing, Nick!
Please look at the numbers on your name tags and go to the table with the corresponding numbers.
These are your groupings.
People with similar resumes and education backgrounds have been grouped together.
Table 34!
We're at the same table!
- So this is rock bottom.
- I mean, call me crazy, but I think we're all getting married tonight.
- Yeah, um - The money table right here, Table 34!
Hi, excuse me, I think that there's been just a little bit of a mistake with the tables.
Over 30, no advanced degrees, Table 34.
No, see, actually, I'm-I'm a professional model.
I'm not famous or anything, but I was in Lil Wayne's last video.
I was the girl he was throwing strawberries at in slow motion.
Definitely Table 34.
Excuse me?
Uh, I didn't get assigned a table.
Now, I know exactly what this is about But I did assign you a seat.
This one.
Lap number one.
Okay, so this is not a racial thing?
Not yet, it isn't.
Ah.
I see what's happening here.
You're feeling my mojo.
You look like a jumpy cat, and I like that.
Ooh, I like that.
Like oversized blueberries.
Mojo off.
Mojo off.
Schmidt, Table Seven, Table Seven.
- What're you doing?
You're at Table Seven, too?
- Hmm?
I'm at Table Seven.
What?
Well, you should feel complimented.
I feel slightly insulted.
- What?
- No offense.
A lot of offense taken.
Well, I'm just saying - A lot.
- Jess!
- Hi!
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Um, okay.
Yeah, I checked in.
Uh, they gave me my table.
- Okay.
- This is a weird date.
I always thought we'd go bowling before we went to an Indian marriage convention.
- What table are you at?
- Uh, Table One, I think.
Table One?
!
It's almost like you save lives or something.
Oh, wait, you do.
Let's start the icebreakers.
This exercise shows how physically compatible two people can be.
Ow!
My hand!
What?
Stupid man.
Nice.
- Yeah.
- Ready?
Three, two, ow.
- Ow!
No, no.
Let's - Up?
- No, you go down.
- All right.
I go down?
Kind of just got to get in a little closer.
Okay, I'm trying.
Seriously.
Hey, dummy.
Stop pointing your finger at me.
That's so annoying.
Why are you drinking my beer?
You point that finger at me one more time, I'm Why don't you just admit that that kiss meant something to you?
- No, no!
- I could tell it meant something, so admit it or I'll do this all day.
I'll do it all day.
Next challenge: Make a table out of nothing but newspaper and tape.
Women look to your left, men to the right.
These are your partners.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
First table that can hold a phone book wins.
All right, so we have to make a table.
Okay.
- Give me the tape.
- No.
I'll tell you what's not made out of newspaper, that tight little ass of yours.
Jess, you liked kissing me!
It's fine to say that.
No, I didn't.
I'm not on my knee asking you to marry me; It was a nice kiss.
You were like a dog and my mouth was like a bowl full of dog milk!
It was like a damn fairy tale, that kiss!
It was the best kiss of your life.
- Are you serious, Nick?
- And you have to take a little responsibility, tarting around in that - little soft pink robe, not expecting to get kissed.
- Tarting around?
I'm a man, Jessica!
- What?
- Pink robes are my catnip.
And we have a winning couple!
We are not a couple!
- We're not a couple.
- And this is a very bad table.
- Terrible table.
- And stop clapping, everybody.
- This is awful.
- Look.
It won't hold anything.
Be prepared to laugh!
No, I mean, this is, like I got it, I got it.
Here, put it down.
Just-- okay.
Very weak table.
Break!
It's a strong table.
Strong table, strong couple.
Come on.
Jump up, yeah.
Jump up!
Jump up!
Jump up!
- Whoa!
Come on.
- Wow.
- Wow, yeah.
It's real, man.
- Come on.
That's an impressive table!
Congratulations on winning the table-building competition, baby.
- Yeah, it didn't mean anything, so - I didn't think it meant anything.
- Yeah, no, just-- - Nick just drives me crazy.
- It's like-- you know?
- Yeah, I mean, I never - Well, yeah, that's just - That's what I was saying.
Is there something I should know here?
No.
'Cause Men, switch seats!
No.
Sam, stop.
'Cause No, I want to talk to you.
- Sam, I - Do you like field hockey?
I Yeah.
Yeah.
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie.
Pass.
So, when did you decide to become a model?
Oh.
Didn't really think about it at all.
Someone just said they'd pay me for being pretty, so - I like your hat.
- Shh.
- It's my favorite color.
- Shh - I didn't say anything.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.
So how many children do you want?
Well, I have to start soon, so I guess I'll just jump right in.
So, do you think through any of your decisions or do you always just do whatever you want?
Hey!
M. Night Shyamalan.
I got a twist ending Shut up.
- What do you want, Table Seven?
- Schmidt, just talk to your girl.
- Hi!
- You better watch it, buddy.
'Cause I will, I will Cal-cut-a-bitch up in here.
- I will Cal-cut-a-bitch.
- Schmidt!
Don't worry, Ben Affleck.
I'm not desperate.
I don't date below Table Six.
Time's up.
Switch places.
Sam That was not nice.
He crossed a line.
Schmidt, you said you would leave me alone.
- You said you would leave - He crossed a line.
You said you would leave me alone.
Funny seeing you here.
Hey.
You have to go.
Yeah, you have to go over there.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Go now.
Hi.
Um, Sam, I do have something to tell you.
You know why we're at Table 34?
'Cause we're both bad at life, but we have model good looks.
It's 'cause we don't think things through.
You didn't think it through when you kissed Jess.
She told me.
It's like we just make these impulsive decisions, and all we end up doing is hurting other people.
I can't believe this.
No.
No, Sam Sam?
Wait.
Sam, wait.
I'm really sorry.
I said I wanted to commit to this.
I thought you understood what that meant.
I do.
I did.
Hey, hey.
Sam, listen.
- What?
- Sam, hear me out.
I kissed her, okay?
She didn't kiss me.
It didn't mean anything to her.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, Nick.
It's the training.
He's in such terrible shape!
You could've killed him.
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.
Jess, it may not have meant something to you, but it meant something to me.
Is there another doctor in the house?
!
With this crowd, I'm sure.
I'm done.
So Good-bye, Jess.
No.
Sam.
Ice it, 24 hours.
And keep it elevated.
- He even exits cool.
- Oh, God.
Anu?
I got something for you.
Now, this is Freddy.
As you can see, he has the exact same build as me, all right?
And he is totally available.
Ain't that right, Freddy?
That is what I call an arranged bang.
Freddy, are you scared of being confined in small spaces?
Oh, you'll do just fine.
Now, just remember, wherever you are, the Mojo Man is there.
Damn it, Schmidt.
I'm taking this.
Excuse me.
Excuse me!
Hold up!
You know, when I came here today, I thought India was a pretty cool country.
You guys are obviously smart.
You l-looked at the roof of a bus and you said, "That's not just a roof, that's more seating".
Kal Penn, he's a genius.
Thank you for him.
But what I didn't know is that you're a country full of blind idiots.
- Oh, God.
- Because in your midst walks a brown angel.
That woman.
Right there.
I may be an idiot, but I'm smart enough to know what I lost.
You people could've had it all.
And you shoved her over there at a table with Nick.
Get your crap together, India.
Schmidt out!
Hello.
I didn't see you over here.
I would love to Sorry I didn't see you earlier.
Okay.
They're all-- okay.
You don't all have to run over there at once.
I mean, she she's not that great, you guys.
I mean, she's kind of old.
You should see her areolas-- one's like a helicopter pad, the other one's like a, you know, like like a tick bite.
It's freaky.
Very disorienting.
It feels like a perfect night Is this making you feel better at all?
At midnight, to fall in love with strangers Ah, ah, ah, ah Yeah, we're happy, free, confused And lonely at the same time I just wanted to listen to Taylor Swift alone!
Oh, yeah How's that?
You know when you get dumped and you're, like, racking your brain for what was it that I did wrong?
Well, this is a really unique situation in that I don't have to do that.
Well, what happened?
I'm sorry.
I know what-- I know that it's my fault.
I didn't mean it like Jess, can I say something - that'll potentially not help this situation?
- No.
I've never been a home-wrecker.
And I liked it.
I mean, Sam was threatened by me.
I mean, I see that as a victory.
But in-in more important uh, ways, a huge, huge, devastating loss.
For you.
Should I call Cece?
This feels like Cece territory.
This isn't Nick territory.
This is, uh Look, Jess I'm sorry, okay, that I kissed you.
But I shouldn't have done it, because it was obviously a mistake, and now you're crying and I won't do it again.
Well maybe it was a little bit broken to begin with.
- What happened?
- He just He always wanted to fist bump in the morning.
- And you didn't like that?
- I hated it.
What are what - I feel like you're forgiving me.
- No.
- I felt like before I said that you were though.
- Nope.
Nope.
Now you remembered you're still mad at me.
No?
Okay.
- All right, good night, Nick.
Night.
- Okay, good night, Jess.
Hey, Jess.
Too soon?
Yeah, too soon!
Well, hey, good night.
And I'm sorry about everything.
Okay.
Okay, yeah.
- That was - Yeah.
That was - a little bit weird.
- So weird.
Let's not ever do that again.
- Yeah.
- Do it again.
Okay.
- Good night.
Night, Miller!
- Good night.
Good night, Sergeant.
I'm glad everything's back to normal around here.
Thank you for what you said up there.
- You know, I got a lot of phone numbers.
- Good.
I think I'm gonna go on a lot of dates.
- I think that's a great thing.
Good.
- Yeah.
The plan hasn't changed; I am still marrying an Indian guy.
- No, yeah, that's fine.
- Okay?
But you went home with a Jew in a turban, so I'm just saying.
Just take this off.
Come on.
Let's go.
God, I have missed this.
Turban on?
Turban off?
I'm gonna hate myself for saying this, but turban on.
- Turban on it is.
- Uh-uh Taking that magic carpet ride.
- Yeah?
No?
- Shut up!
Whoo!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
I like how things aren't weird between us.
Right?
'Cause if somebody walked in here and saw us, they'd be, like, "Look at those two totally normal roommates.
I bet they never sucked face".
But we did.
You sucked my face.
I sucked your face.
- You did.
- Who cares?
- You totally sucked my face.
- Sorry that I touched your hand there.
- It was accidental.
Like, who acc?
- Yeah.
I mean, which is cool, 'cause that's the thing.
It's, like, we're just roommates.
Who cares?
We're just cool.
- I totally agree.
Yes.
- You know what I mean?
Let's reward ourselves, 'cause we're doing so well.
Table for two, fanciest restaurant in town.
Yeah, and then we could have sex.
- Just joking, I was just jok-- I was just joking.
- Yeah, no, I know it was a joke.
Spot.
There's-There's a parking spot.
I just finished rinsing out the Dumpster, and while I was buffing the backside, I found this-- So, who gets the spot?
- Me.
- You know what?
I never get anything.
- I would like it.
- I need a win.
Give me the spot, or I'll kill you all!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
I park under an overpass.
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
We all have crappy parking.
Guys, why don't we just all share the spot?
We'll each get it for a day and a half every week, and then we split Sunday into six-hour shifts.
Does it say "Share stuff" in the Constitution of America?
No, it does not.
Nicholas, what does it say?
Don't share stuff.
No one deserves that spot more than I do.
You know?
'Cause Lord knows, I've done my fair share of spotworthy things.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Daisy travels so much, and I work at night, so, you know, our sex window is like I've lived in this loft as long, if not longer, than anyone.
I have the crummiest room, I'm on 24-hour grout watch.
I pay the lion's share of the utilities, do I not?
- I refuse to pay for the wiffi.
- It's WiFi.
I didn't even have to tell you guys about the spot.
Why did I tell you guys about the spot?
Oh, damn it!
I'm the dumbest boy in school!
As the only woman in the loft Don't play the lady card.
- I will play the lady card.
- Race card.
Lazy drunk card.
Deserves-the-spot card.
Do I not, every day, have to deal with Outside Dave?
Dave?
I have to use my car now, Dave.
I work so hard, I just want some sleep!
Dave, I'm gonna go get some coffee.
Um, can I get you anything?
He throws dentures at me, he doesn't like cookies.
Because I believe so strongly in women's equality, I refuse to give you preferential treatment.
Well, that's really cool, Schmidt.
I really Wait a minute.
Oh.
Sex window.
Now, if you all will excuse me, I am about to go and park my car on her parking spot.
- Ew.
Ew!
- As if there was anything - more important than this.
- Get out.
I still want the spot, though.
Obviously not getting the spot.
And then there were three.
That's right.
Just the way I want it.
Come on!
It's a good job, guys.
Yes!
How do you two care about stuff so much?
Well, you know what this means, Jessica, don't you?
Nicholas Miller is now a swing vote.
- What?
No!
- He's right, 'cause we're both voting for ourselves, so that makes you the decider.
You two are on your own.
I'm out.
You can't escape destiny.
She comes for us all, that relentless bitch.
That's right.
Destiny's a lady.
Destiny might be a lady, but victory has a penis.
Direct quote-- Scott Caan.
Yup.
Hey.
I found one of your hoodies, and I borrowed it.
You want to know what I'm wearing underneath this shirt?
- Yeah, sure.
- An invisible shirt.
I'm confused, Jess.
These are so long.
Oh.
I wouldn't put that in your mouth.
- Do you chew on this?
- I do.
Mmm.
You do, huh?
It's crunchy.
- Oh.
- You get hit in the head or something?
- Hmm?
- Are you flirting with me to get the spot?
How dare you accuse me of that.
- The parking spot is yours.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Nick.
That's so cool of you.
Sometimes I can be a gentleman, believe it or not.
- Cool.
- Cool.
All right.
- Well, thank you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Get in here.
Yeah, we can Let's hug this out.
Purple nurple!
Thank you.
I don't know why I did that.
I'll get ice.
Why did you do that?
Oh, finally.
What took you so long?
I said 2:45, not 3:08.
I couldn't follow your directions.
I'm telling you, girl, this complex is like a maze.
Every building in this place looks exactly the same.
And for future reference, I'm more of a left-right kind of guy, not so much - a north-south kind of guy.
- Put on a condom.
Hmm I don't, uh You forgot a condom?
- You got a grocery bag?
- No.
- Tin foil?
- No.
- Hand sanitizer?
- No.
You got a shower cap and a twist tie?
You didn't bring the one thing we need to have sex?
- What about a baseball cap that's really small?
- Are you serious?
Um, I got quick reflexes.
Mm, I'm gonna take care of this, okay?
Okay, well, look, do not waste my time.
I will be back faster than you can say, "Damn, Winston, I took care of myself already".
Don't-don't say that, though.
Do not Wait for me.
Wait Who wants an ice-cold Heisler, all dressed up in a frosty mug?
- Sure.
I like beer.
- I know you haven't officially decided on the spot yet, but I just wanted to say, thanks, man.
What for, Schmidt?
We both know that you're gonna give the spot to me, but I love that you're keeping up the charade.
Spot's going to Jess.
- Jess?
- Jess.
- Give me the beer back.
- I'm trying to be a gentleman.
Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, Nick.
Oh.
- How you doing?
- Good.
How are you?
Good.
- What the hell?
- Hmm?
What the hell?
I'm checking my e-mails.
Oh.
Okay.
Think that I'm blind?
Think I can't smell it?
You think I can't hear it?
The stench of filth and lust is all over this room.
Smells like freaking Tijuana.
What happened here?
- Nothing.
- Hardly anything.
Hardly anything?
!
You know I'm not good at this, Jess.
Shut up.
Okay, fine.
We kissed.
Eh.
It was nothing.
So?
Uh, moving on.
Don't be weird about this, Schmidt.
Remember I mean, it was like a dare, basically.
Yeah.
Mazel tov to the both of you.
Well, I don't know what "Mazel tov" means, but it doesn't sound good.
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry about that.
Emergency.
Emergency.
Sorry about that.
I need a condom.
That'll be $8.75.
All right.
What the hell?
What the?
Damn it, took Daisy's pants.
Look, I don't have any money right now, but, you know, I have somebody waiting for me, so if you could just, you know?
- Next.
- Wait.
No.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, look, what about that box of condoms right there, man?
They're practically open, right?
How about you just slide one out and throw a brother a loosie?
Next.
Come on.
Hey, everybody.
What's up?
My name is Winston Bishop, and I am in desperate need of a condom.
- Okay, that's it.
- Now hear me out.
- Okay?
Okay.
- Come on.
Sorry, folks.
Hey, Schmidt?
Hello, Schmidt?
You okay?
- Who?
Me?
- Yeah.
Yeah, look, guys, I'm fine.
Look, I admit, at first I was thrown, but I'm fine.
Are you seriously doing this?
!
I can't believe this!
This is so dumb!
I'm sorry.
I'm just I'm trying to process this whole thing.
Nick, you're my best friend, and you should have told me.
And Jess, what do you think?
Mono is just some sort of joke?
Nothing has changed.
Like same old, same old.
Except for the fact that, uh, pre-kiss Jess didn't have a parking spot.
Post-kiss Jess does.
Sounds like change.
I won the spot fair and square, Schmidt.
- Did you, though?
- I wouldn't say fair and square.
All right.
Fine.
I used my body.
Is that what you want to hear?
I shook what the good people of Oregon gave me, and I got a parking space.
Let me tell you something, Nicholas Miller.
You know, had Winston kissed me, you're the first person I would have told!
I know you would have told me if Winston kissed you.
But I guess your loyalty lies elsewhere.
I can't handle this!
Fine.
Schmidt, congratulations.
The spot is yours.
- Okay.
Really.
- It's him.
What?
!
Nick Miller, you weakling.
I can't have people thinking my decision wasn't above board.
This city can't have another scandal!
- Wise choice.
- Thanks.
He's been manipulating you the whole time.
- Look at him.
- I don't think Look at his smi-- he's smiling evilly.
You know what, Jess?
Stop.
You're manipulating me, he's manipulating me, and I'm getting confused.
I am the decider of us three!
I decide!
Let the decider decide!
I am not the suggester!
I'm not having a good time with this game.
Give my regards to Outside Dave.
Stay away from my space or you'll have this to deal with.
S Where are your nipples, man?
I'll never tell.
You're either gonna break your finger, or you're gonna break that button.
I'm not going back in there.
It's too weird.
You're the one making it weird, Nick.
You want weird?
I'll give you weird.
Weird, weird, weird.
Fine.
Weirder, weirder, weirder.
Weird, weird, weird.
Uh, weird, right, ugh.
Weird.
Weird.
Weird.
- Weird, weirder, weird.
- Weird, weird.
- Weird, weird.
- Weird.
- Weird!
Weird.
Weird!
- What are we doing?
!
I don't know!
You started it!
- Is this how it's gonna be?
Is it?
- What are we talking about, Jess?
You think things like this aren't gonna come up all the time?
We need a long-term solution.
I'll give you a long-term solution.
I'm taking the spot!
Oh, my God.
What is all the commotion?
- He's taking the spot!
- He can't do that!
Kill him, kill him-- you said you'd kill him!
- Now kill him!
Now's your chance!
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.
First car in the spot gets it.
Aah!
Aw, damn it!
You middled me again?
!
I'm not to be middled; It's in my contract.
Shoot!
Excuse me.
Aah!
Hey, five bucks if you help me fold this nicely.
I'm not going above six, so don't negotiate with me.
Aah!
Go, go, sorry, go.
Oh, I'm sorry, I-- okay, sorry, go.
Move it, you wacky bitch!
It won't start.
Help me push it!
Get behind it.
Back in the box!
Aw, cats.
Hey, hey, buddy.
What?
Mine.
The laws of parking require a vehicle.
This is my vehicle.
This is my vehicle.
Don't.
Don't you do it, Schmidt.
I'm not afraid.
Schmidt, no.
- You just hit me.
- Damn right I did.
You're sitting right in the middle - of the spot.
- You hit me with your car over a parking spot, Schmidt.
Get out of the spot!
Jess.
Move or I will hit you.
I want that spot.
- No.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Not a joke, move, move.
- No.
- What are you doing, Jess?
- Move, move.
Jess, stop it.
What are you doing?
Stop the car, you lunatic.
She's insane.
- No-- oh!
- O-h!
No, no!
What is she doing?
What is going on?
Can't believe I'm going down like this.
You're not in the space!
Okay, all right, mine, mine, I'm not leaving.
I'm not leaving either.
I have a purse full of hard candy and an empty bladder.
I'm here all night, folks.
- I'm here all night.
- I'm here all night.
- I'm here all night.
- I-- that's what I said.
I'm really happy you gave me another shot.
Yeah, so am I. You know, you, you can't judge someone based on their friends.
No, and I feel like, if you gave them another chance, you'd really like them.
They are down to earth and chill, - no drama.
- Yeah?
Hey, Cece, it's Winston!
You got a rubber?
!
I need a rubber.
He said "rhubarb," that's how he pronounces "rhubarb" It's so weird.
Nah, nah, I-I need a condom for my penis!
What are you doing?
Okay, we're not close enough for this.
Alright, we have spent very little time together.
You are the only person that I know in this neighborhood.
Don't you dare come in my house.
Hey, man, hey.
- Hey.
- I'm Winston, good to see you again.
- Shivrang, Hi.
- You got a condom on you?
Oh, no, no, look that's not, We're, um.
Her mother and my mother - I'm a chemical engineer.
- Winston, Look, Shivrang, man to man, I know you have a condom in your wallet, but my question to you is: Do you actually think you' gonna get lucky with a a sexy lady like that?
You know, I feel like I'm getting lucky by just being here.
- Be honest with me.
- Ok, fine, I've got a condom.
- Aha!
- Winston.
- Is he going to need that condom tonight?
- Oh, God.
- I'm gonna punch you in the face.
- Shall I give you a minute to think about it?
- 'Cause I can wait.
- I'm gonna wring your damn neck.
- This is awful, like, really - Okay, okay.
Get out.
- This is worse than last time.
- Honestly, physically removing you now.
- I'm going.
- Out of my house.
It's a sour ball, not a bank safe.
Just open the candy.
- Are you hungry?
- Yes, I'm starving.
Why don't you go upstairs to the kitchen?
It's full of food.
Just give me the damn candy.
- Go get it.
- Wait, no, no, no.
Aah.
Okay, I have, like, a stabbing pain, it's-- and it's, and it's like right here.
It's my pishy.
I, I have to pish.
I think we should take a break.
- Leave and you're out.
- Drown in your own urine.
I got to find a condom.
I need a condom!
But I still want the spot.
Come on, come on, come on, Nick, come on.
Okay.
Condom, condom, condom.
Damn it.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Here we go here we go.
I mean, she's either having crazy amounts of sex or she does not know how to use these things.
Oh, just focus, man, bring it in.
Absorb it.
Yeah.
Did you just pee inside your body?
Yes.
This is your fault, Nick.
You compromised the whole loft.
We had an agreement.
When Jessica Day signed that lease, you, me, and Coach all took a no-nail oath.
No-nail oath?
I didn't break the no-nail oath.
Your mouth nailed her mouth.
For the record, no one nailed my mouth.
That's important to me.
Also, we didn't do anything wrong.
Do you know nothing about men?
Yeah, I know nothing about men.
That's why I'm wearing a short skirt and wool tights.
A woman cannot be in close quarters with three men and kiss one of them.
What fuels men?
Competition and sex.
That's why the United Nations was formed, that's why girls aren't allowed on pirate ships, and that is why there is a no-nail oath in apartment 4D, and deep down inside, Nick knows that I'm right.
Mm-hmm, back me up here, Nick.
I just want a piece of candy.
Are you serious?
You didn't give me the spot and now you won't back me up?
- You coward.
- Why should he?
Because he-- because Because, what, you kissed, and now he owes you some sort of emotional support and loyalty?
Reason number two for the no-nail oath-- bitches be crazy.
Isn't that right, Nick?
I found garbage that has chocolate on it.
Daisy, I'm back.
Daisy.
Hey, Daisy, I'm here!
Where you at?
!
I don't have my phone, and all these buildings look alike, and I Hey, Daisy!
- You know Daisy?
- Shut up.
No?
All right, okay, cool.
Now, I walked around with "yum" on my butt all day.
I deserve sex-- protected sex.
Daisy!
Schmidt's right.
I thought we could go back to the way things were, but we can't.
You nailed my mouth and you nailed it good and hard and strong.
Now things have changed.
Okay, but they don't have to have changed.
It's just different, Nick, it is.
That kiss was the dumbest mistake I have ever made-- dumber than Caroline, dumber than law school, dumber than when I thought it was pronounced "Brock Omabrama".
- What?
- I thought his name was pronounced "Brock Oma" It's not If I could go back in time and take back the kiss, I would.
I would take it back, I regret it.
Congratulations, you're the proud owner of a new parking spot.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Jess, wait.
You realize, every second that you don't run after her, you become more and more of a buttwad, don't you?
Did you pee yourself?
That I did, that I did.
- Jess.
- Hi.
Hey, look Why you holding a box of fish sticks?
Because I'm going to go scare the feral cats away that live in my current parking spot, Nick.
I'm going to throw fish sticks at them while singing "Memory," and don't you dare criticize me.
I don't regret kissing you.
I regret what it did, I regret that it made things weird.
We are roommates, you know, we got to figure this out, Jess.
A no-nail oath?
You thought I was going to sleep with one of you, like I just couldn't help it?
It was me, Jess, I couldn't help it.
You dropped your fish sticks.
Shut up, Nick.
Ay, ay, ay.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
- We're having a conversation.
- Will you please get out of here?
Yeah, well, that's the problem, isn't it?
Because I live here, too, and I'm gonna be here when all of this goes to crap.
Next time you guys have your dirty little thoughts about each other, you better be thinking about me, too, because I ain't going nowhere.
You are literally sitting in a puddle of your own pee.
The apartment 4D no-nail oath right here: "We, the undersigned, "Agree never to nail our roommate Jessica Day "unless the sex can be parlayed into a business that provides for all parties involved".
- What?
- I didn't read the fine print.
"If one of the undersigned nails said female, well, then all must nail her".
- What?
!
- I didn't know there was fine print.
- What, what?
!
- I didn't know there was fine Let me be very clear here-- I am a strong, self-sufficient woman, and I will not be nailing you, Schmidt, or Nick or Schmidt.
Notice I said that twice because I don't feel it's sinking in.
There will be no nails or screws or hammers in this building area generally, the whole thing.
What, do you think that I want to do this?
Believe me, pass.
I just don't want my home turning into a den of sexual tension and lies.
Now, do you want things to go back to normal or not?
- Yes.
- Yes, I do, but I Then, I just have to kiss you.
This is just one of those things-- let's just do it No, I-I get past it, we move on.
I think that's a bad idea.
Nick, you're into this, right?
I don't know, might help.
Are you serious?
I don't know.
Okay, fine, just get over here and do it and do it fast.
- I'll be a hero.
- Bring it on.
Mmm Aah.
- Ooh.
- No.
- No.
- Mistake.
- It was really a mistake.
- A big mi-- I made it weirder.
Is everyone in the world having sex but me?
!
Old people, foreigners, nerds.
Everyone's banging.
Schmidt and Jess?
!
Everyone is out there getting and giving except for old Winnie.
Look at me-- a man who has absolutely nothing.
I left my phone, my wallet, and my dignity at Daisy's house.
I even left my pants there-- look at this.
- Yum.
- Yum.
I need a win, damn it, I need a win.
You need a win, pal.
Yeah.
It's a little tight in here.
Are you sure this isn't too tight?
Okay, um Uh-uh, this ain't gonna work.
This ain't gonna work for me.
Uh, I'm stuck.
Guys, hey, guys.
Hey, where y'all?
Guys guys Guys!
Hello?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
This month marks Nick and my ten year anniversary of living together.
Our "tin" anniversary.
Ten years?
You guys are like - Bert and Ernie.
- I got dibs on Bert.
- Dibs on Ernie.
- Nice.
- Cool, man.
All right.
- Yeah, man.
Now, obviously, we're going to have an anniversary party.
You guys are invited.
I'm not sure if I'm coming to that, man.
Remember the "wood" anniversary?
Ah!
You cut me!
Well, happy anniversary!
I gotta get a tourniquet.
Hold some more wood for me.
Yeah!
Well, it wasn't as bad as paper.
Happy anniversary!
Paper!
Party time, man.
Did you know that the chemical symbol for tin is SN?
- Schmidt and Nick.
- What?
Is no one else's mind blown by this?
That's it, our theme is TinFinity.
TinFinity.
That's actually really good, Schmidt.
- Yeah, it is.
- I really don't think two men who live together for ten years need a party.
Why must you always be like this?
Because you never let me participate in the planning.
I would love for you to participate.
Gah!
That was a trick.
I was trying to get out of it.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
They're celebrating ten years of living together?
Why are we friends with these guys, Jess?
- I - What happened?
It's so weird to think that Nick is the last person I kissed.
Actually, Schmidt's - the last person I kissed.
- Okay, what?
It was nothing.
Nick was watching.
What is happening in this loft?
Ooh, girls chatting.
Hey, Nick.
I wish I knew what was going on inside Nick's head.
He's this, like, grumpy mystery.
Jess, are these open for anybody?
- Yep.
- Right on, thank you.
He can't communicate a feeling to save his life.
But why can't I stop thinking about his mouth on my mouth?
Hey, Jess, do I have frosting on my lips?
Look at my mouth-- do I have frosting on it?
Wh-Why are you asking me this?
My mouth feels moist and weird.
Do I have anything on it?
Get out of here!
Ugh!
Aw Okay, you know what?
You need what I needed.
You need a new guy, all right?
Dating Shivrang helped me get past all the weird stuff with Schmidt.
I need the Anti-Nick.
- Yeah.
- I need a real man, who can express his feelings, and I need a different mouth on my mouth.
To erase that mouth.
No, you actually don't need to wash raw denim.
Haven't washed my pants in 18 months.
Also, I'm bisexual.
Microchips be gettin' small.
They be, like, blueberry size.
So you could put 'em in your cereal, girl.
I don't get your thing.
It's prescription.
Damn it.
What happened to the guys in this bar?
They open up a bus station next door?
Where are the real men?
I can't talk right now.
I'm writing a strongly-worded e-mail to my florist.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, look at the door, don't look at the door, look right now, don't look, one at a time, look, but don't look.
Guys, one at a time.
Don't look now.
Look.
No, you're both looking.
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm confused.
Look right now at the door.
Go.
Oh that is a strapping young man.
That is Jax McTavish.
He plays safety for San Francisco.
Why's he with Winston?
Winston looks so cool.
- What up, guys?
- Oh, "What's up, guys".
You're just gonna walk over and say, "What's up, guys"?
Winston, does he think you're Omar Epps?
You guys talking about Jax?
Look, I interviewed him at the radio station, and we just hit it off.
It's not a big deal, you know, unless you think hanging out with a pro baller is a big deal.
His hands are so big and warm.
I want to fall asleep in them, like Thumbelina.
How about, uh, introducing me?
Yeah, okay.
You and Jax?
Yeah.
Jess and Jax McTavish.
Great bit, Jess.
What a dumb idea.
- Do it.
- No.
- You can't handle that kind of thunder.
- Hell, no.
Jax and I are just becoming friends.
- I'm going over there.
- Jess, no, Jess.
Guys Hey, Jess, let me show you something.
Hmm?
It's right here.
Hi, I'm Jess.
I'm Winston's roommate.
How you doing?
- I'm Jax.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Jess, stop it, stop it.
- Cool, so I hear you play for San Francisco.
- I do.
I can't believe you didn't go to the Pro Bowl.
Here's my question: What's a "point-eight" tackle?
Did you know I'm a teacher?
What would you teach me?
Nick the theme is "masculine garden party".
Look at that-- I made a graph.
I thought you said I was gonna help you plan it.
Nick, we both know that you're not very good with party chores.
You sent out the invitations, right?
Me?
!
I sent them out?
Okay, I'm older now.
I am wiser.
I want to help plan my own party.
Okay, fine, I will give you balloons Oh, sweet, balloons are and Porta Potties.
Porta Potties?
!
That sounds like a job for babies.
Does that look like a job for babies?
Oh, so this is a big job?
- I thought you were being disrespectful.
- No!
- Oh.
- Where do you think people are gonna go to the bathroom?
I never thought of that.
And you are now in charge of that, and if you dig a hole in a- in, in a dirt field, I'm gonna kill you.
I don't want the responsibility.
You can do this, man.
What, what are your chores?
- Well, Porta Potties.
- Porta Potties.
What's-- now, what is the first chore that I gave you?
I have absolutely no memory.
Balloons!
I'm having an anxiety attack.
Yes, Ma, yes, now, look, I-have to go.
It's two men celebrating living together for ten years.
Uh, no, they're not.
No, I can tell you for a fact that they're not.
Okay, okay, I'm hanging up.
So, good news.
Um, my mom spoke to your mom last night, and they've given us their blessings.
So that means Well, now that the moms approve, when do you want to do this thing?
Is that a that a proposal?
Oh, are, are you upset?
I'm sorry, I It's just, with arranged marriage, there isn't a lot of romance.
No, no, no, I'm s-- I'm sorry, actually.
I think I'm just a little taken aback by how quick this all has been.
I barely know you, and I used to just think that if I was being proposed to, I would notice it was happening.
But we're doing this thing?
Maybe you could just stop saying "doing this thing".
Yup.
Really did it.
Beautiful job, thank you so much, what a This is amazing-- everything's tin, you guys, everything.
Hey, man.
Rented out the whole park, so take your soccer someplace else.
Give us our ball back, you douche.
Hey, yeah, sure, no, I'll give you your ball back.
Great.
Pure tin, pure tin.
Take your football back to Europe.
- Really?
- Who's the douche now, you douche "B"?
I couldn't stop you from inviting Jax to the party, but I can stop it from going any further.
I will not lose Jax as a friend, okay?
I might not have any game, but, oh, my goodness, can I take game away.
I'm getting that mouth on my mouth, and don't you try to stop me, you Look, clearly I have the upper hand when it comes to Jax.
- Do you?
- Oh, I do, because I know all about sports.
Jess, you know nothing about sports.
Oh, what am I going to do?
I guess I'll just have to use my eyes, hair, boobs, legs, and adorable personality.
Fool.
I got, like, three of those things.
These are amazing.
You also got tablecloths?
I feel so fancy.
How much did you spend on this, Schmidt?
Ah, Nicholas, I have what's called an income, you know.
Well, you're not the only one who spent a little bit of money on this.
- Okay.
- Check this out, Schmidt, you're gonna freak out.
Hey, I'm presenting, I'm presenting it.
And that ain't no rental.
Get up here.
This is owned and operated by Mr. Nick Miller.
Little help from Sid.
You bought a Porta Potti?
This one has warm and cold water, real soap dispensers, a fan.
Too much.
What's that?
That's garbage.
Garbage-- that's what the nursing home said about my mattress.
I'll take it.
For 60 bucks, and they threw in something called "septic enzymes," which I don't know what that is, but you're not supposed to get it in your eyes, for sure.
I'm a small business owner.
Why on earth would you buy a?
You know what?
Forget about it, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, man.
- I gave you a chore and you came through.
Yeah, now, look, now we have two.
- What do you mean we have two-- two of what?
- Two bathrooms.
Yours and El BaÃ±o Presidente.
That's a Porta Potti?
Yeah, luxury toilet.
I thought that was the visitor's center.
- Well - That's enormous.
Why did you get that, Schmidt?
What, did you think I was gonna screw up?
No, come on, man, no.
You know how our relationship works.
I'm over-responsible, you're under-responsible.
Here's the good news-- now people have a backup to use No, I want everyone to use this, I want it to be the main potty.
Oh, n-no, I don't think that should be the main anything.
I think people would be better off if they just made a caca in their hand.
I don't think so; Mine's better than that.
- I'm sure you killed it on balloons.
- Well if you let me explain - what happened with the balloons - Who needs balloons?
I didn't want balloons anyway.
This isn't a little girl's birthday party.
This is a celebration of friendship.
- Then, as a friend - Yeah.
I want you to get rid of that.
- I want everybody using mine.
- You spit on the - You brought a dirt dungeon to our TinFinity.
- All right, well, we'll see.
I'm proud of you; You did good.
I'm proud of you.
You bought a spaceship.
Hey, man, you watch Homeland?
No?
I'm in the first season, second episode.
Don't spoil anything.
Hey, flag on the play.
Too many men on the field.
Winston, get out.
Jax, over here on the bench with me.
- Come on, let me show you some stuff.
- Okay.
Go, go, Jess, go.
Oh, boy.
You want me?
Come and get me.
I'm gonna get you you can't get by me.
You're down.
Why would you do that?
Winston, we're on the same team.
What are you doing?
You did it!
Touchdown!
Man.
N-N-No!
Why?
What's going on, Sid?
Did you tell 'em that ours works?
Hey, guys, this is available, no line.
That Porta Potti - looks weird, Nick.
- What?
It looks a little, looks a little weird.
You look a little weird, Sanders.
Why don't you wipe your butt with a little strawberry crepe, you little whiner?
I don't really do well with bathroom pressure.
- Robby, don't dog me like this.
- I'm gonna give you your space.
No, 'cause they're all following you, Robby, they're all Get in there.
I don't have to go anymore.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So that's not full of pee?
- No.
- I saw you drinking those sodas.
- No, no, no, it's good.
- How about now?
Stop, stop, you're gonna make me I don't have to go, I don't have to go.
Get in there, dude, or get out of this party.
Wrong choice.
Nick, what are you doing?
I bought a Porta Potti, Jess.
- What, why?
- Yeah.
- I'm a small business owner - You own - a Porta Potti?
- Yeah, but nobody's using it.
This is not about a Porta Potti.
It is about a Porta Potti.
I don't want to talk about this.
You know, it's been really nice hanging out with Jax because he likes to talk about his feelings.
Give me a break, Jess.
Is that really what you want-- a man who talks about his feelings all the time?
No, right?
Do you want me to use your Porta Potti?
Yeah, but don't just do it for me; Do it 'cause you want to.
Mm, I'm definitely doing it for you.
- And just a tip - Yeah?
If you want people to use your toilet, don't camp out in front of it.
Do me a favor, if you're going to go in.
- Mm-hmm.
- Really sell it, 'cause I want girls to see it.
- Okay.
- You know what I mean?
Just, like, make a show of it.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Bye, Jess, thank you Ooh, just my style!
Nicely vintage.
Can't wait to get inside!
Sure wish I had a good book.
Can't wait.
Oh, this is horrible!
I got it; You told me like, ten times.
Okay, but I'm just saying, I don't know what that one does.
Look, the instant the big speech begins, you initiate toast sequence.
You got that, Red?
Look, don't-don't mess this up.
Tippy go bye-bye, you mess this up.
- Tippy go bye-bye.
- Okay.
Okay, great.
Bite me, you wang.
What did you say, man?
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey.
You remember Shivrang?
Shivrang, what is up, my man?
Welcome to America.
Listen, just a little heads up, we're serving cow-meat tacos tonight, so You mean beef.
Cow meat, Shivrang.
I'm not crazy.
It is beef, right?
Hey, can I just say I like you a lot?
I like you, too.
A lot?
'Cause I said "A lot".
I-I knew I felt this way, the moment I met you.
Yes, a guy who can tell me exactly how he feels.
That's what I want.
That is what I want.
It's just You, uh You make me Are you okay?

- Hey, Schmidty.
.
It's almost toast time, and I made - Okay.
made up a few cards.
You know, just jotted down a few notes and bullet points for you.
I was gonna do my own toast.
I know what I want to say about you.
At least take a look at them.
- I worked really hard on these.
- "I'm nothing without you".
"Thank you for supporting me "during that thing, financially and" This is a full speech.
Feel free to make it your own.
Why is it that you think you're better than me, Schmidt?
What?
What are you talking about?
Why do you think you're better than me?
Our friendship didn't used to be this way.
You know, back in college, we were equals.
You get any last night?
- No.
You?
- Hell, yeah.
- Really?
- No.
- We're equals.
- Equals.
And then you got that juicer, which I was excited about.
You were at a dangerous fat level, but somehow you got skinny, and I became this idiot that you need to take care of.
Don't resent me for getting my life together.
- Oh, your life's together?
- Yeah.
You're throwing a party to celebrate living with your college roommate - for ten years.

I see you've come to gloat.
Is Jax known for being intense?
Yeah, Jess, he's supposed to be intense.
He's a professional athlete.
You know, he doesn't run.
He sprints.
He doesn't jump.
He leaps.
And he doesn't like, Jess.
He loves.
Hmm.

I cry in my bedroom, in the bathroom, in the hallway, in the elevator.

To start again with somebody new Hi.
Uh, I'd like to say something, too.
- That's Jax McTavish.
- I know.
Um, I'd like to report a missing item.
My heart.
It was stolen by that little heart thief right there.
I'm I'm innocent.
I didn't I was framed.
I just want to say in front of God and all these people at this gorgeous party that I'm in love with you.
Mm no.
No.

I met my third wife!
Schmidty?
Schmidty?
Schmidty?
Hey.
- Schmidt - Stop it!
You okay, buddy?
Yeah.
No, I'm-I'm fine.
It's just, I'm really annoyed about the lighting cues.
Also, our girl-to-guy ratio is taking a real nosedive.
I mean, we're, like, two bro groups away from being a total wiener fest.
It's just really disappointing when things don't work out the way you thought they would, you know?
I do.
Hey, why don't we get out of here for a bit?
Get away from this party stress.
You mean, like, take a trip together.
No, just, like, walk 40 yards away.
Don't think we need a trip or anything like that, pal.
- Jess?
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!
Oh, my God!
- So excited for you.
Let me see it.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
So beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.
- Is this good?
This is good, right?
- It's good.
I mean, it's-it's what I wanted.
- Yes!
Yay!
- I'm getting married!
So, what are you what are you doing in here?
- I'm hiding.
- Oh, yeah, that guy.
- He seemed to, uh, really like you when he gave that speech.
- Yeah.
He might not be the one.
So you still thinking about Nick?
No.
Shut up.
No.
All right.
Look at that, man.
You did get a balloon.
Yeah, I got a kick-ass hot air balloon.
But it turns out, you need propane to get it up in the air.
- You didn't know that?
- How would I know?
You didn't want to do any research?
How could I do any research?
I was dealing with the Porta Potti.
It's actually kind of nice.
It's peaceful.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry about Cece, man.
I know it sounds kind of cheesy, but I always thought that I was gonna be the man to bone Cece for the rest of her life.
I think we all did, buddy.
To answer your question from before, this is what we were celebrating.
Yeah, that's right.
This is what we're celebrating.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Yeah.
Right?
You're my best friend, man.
- Please.
- Ten years of living together Upsetting, but kind of great, man.
- Here's to it.
- Yes.
Not having roommates is for real losers, you know that?
Mm-hmm.
- Equals.
- You said it, man.
Oh, you are such a Nancy boy.
- What is in that, man?
- Liquor!
If not for you Babe, I couldn't find the door Mm.
You pick out a song for our first dance?
Yes, I did.
I didn't expect you to dance to it, but you know, I was going to dance for you.
Yeah.
Come on, it's too close quarters for that, Schmidt.
That is beautiful.
Pass the hooch.
Nick's been hogging it all.
Mmm.
Here, have a sip.
My mouth's been on it.
It's not a big deal.
It's just my mouth!
I I It's okay.
I'm all right.
Come on, have a sip!
You put your mouth all over it!
You just said that.
You put your mouth all over it, and I don't want to think about your mouth!
- You okay?
I just - Yup, I'm fine.
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Jess?
I just don't understand why we only have I mean, I feel like I should have my own bottle.
Because we were all gonna share - I don't know where I'm going, but I'm going!
- Where are you going?
!
We're pretty awesome wingmen for each other.
- Right.
- Because we're both the guy the girls want to sleep with, and we're both the other guy, too.
Neither one of us are Tom Cruise or the other one.
We're both Iceman.
- Yeah.
Equals!
- Equals!
You get a lot of girls?
- Um, I don't know.
Yeah - Yeah.
Me, too.
- I feel like you probably have a lot of game with the ladies.
- I know what they want sexually, and I'm not afraid to give it to them.
- I get that from you.
I get that vibe, man.
- What about you?
I feel like I put off a similar vibe, but kind of more - on the down-low, you know what I mean?
- Yeah!
- Equals!
- Equals!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Ah Three more, Cocktail Johnny.
Schmidt, that is melon-flavored liquor.
It's 4 proof, okay?
That is safe to drink while you're pregnant.
- Melon balls.
- Schmidt, no matter how much you get drunk, - Cece's still gonna be engaged.
- Cece?
- Now, I know you're down about it.
- I'm not down about Cece.
- This is, this is a mess.
- Listen, there are plenty of things to be down about: The air pollution in China, the deficit, The Hobbit wasn't very good.
If I want to see dwarves in a real-time dinner scene, I would've gone to Koreatown.
Booyah!
Ball me.
- Ball you?
- Ball me!
What are you How do you get these toppy things off, Nick?
Oh, Schmidt You look like a lab rat.
Okay, you know what?
I'm adding that to your bill.
What the hell is this?
What?
!
You're giving us a check?
- No more free drinks.
- I didn't even know you had these here.
- Take all of my money and then get out of my room.
- You guys, come on.
Show a little respect.
This is my job.
- Nick, I saw you pee in the register.
- Yeah, once.
- You think I was sober for that?
- You once put a sign out that said "Take a Drink, Leave a Drink".
Okay, it's the only job I have, and I'm trying to be good.
Okay?
It's about time I got a little responsibility.
- Responsibility?
- I thought of a new promotion-- it's like Ladies' Night but it's the opposite: It's Guys' Night.
The new manager loved the idea, and if it goes well-- Maybe there's a promotion; I can start moving up in the world.
What?
I want him.
I want him bad.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
What is this?
I think Nick being ambitious and driven about the bar is making me want him more.
Is that, like, a thing?
No.
No woman's ever been attracted to power and success.
It's just like I thought it was one kiss and then it was over.
Hey, sorry, I'm just putting a load on.
Got a shift at the bar.
You know that there's a separate compartment to put the soap in?
I didn't know that.
Little soap house.
Anyway, I'm getting this mess cleaned up.
I gotta say, it feels really good.
Do any of you guys know where the iron is?
- Get out!
- What?
I want to iron my button-down.
- Get out, Nick!
- What is happening right now?
- Get out!
- Why are you being so mean to me?
Get out!
What is going on with you?
There's a new manager; That's why I'm making you guys pay.
And you actually care about what he thinks?
- Hey, Shane.
- Hey.
Hey, guys.
This is Shane.
This is my new manager.
- Oh, got it.
- I'm really excited to have her here.
We're really getting this place in order.
We're, uh Makes a lot more sense now.
God, I can't stop thinking about the other night.
Hope you gave that bar an extra wipe-down.
- Yeah.
- You're just like the opposite of everyone I went to business school with.
- I mean, look at you.
You're just You're so real.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.
- He's incredibly real.
- As real as they get.
- Yeah, the realest.
- Shut up, both of you.
- You're a mess.
- Yeah.
- I got dirt on my face after we made out.
God, I loved it.
Get back to work.
- You got it.
- Get back to work!
- I'm joking.
No, but seriously, - Yeah.
Joke.
Seriously, - get back to work.
Yeah.
- Get back to work.
Yeah.
I know this isn't gonna end well, but the whole middle part's gonna be awesome.
- Good for you.
- What?
Schmidt, stop drinking that.
I'm gonna take care of this.
If I feel down, I come here.
I love this place, man.
You know, the sound of bubbles, soothing synth music.
If this place doesn't take your mind off of Cece, then I don't know, man.
Look at that.
So beautiful.
And exotic.
Perfect curves.
Giant almond eyes.
Caramel-colored stripes.
Sumptuous lips.
Are you talking about the fish?
Excuse me.
You, sir, that works here.
What is this fish-- the one that floats like an angel?
How much for this one?
Ah, that is the lovely but elusive California lionfish.
It's perfect.
I must have it.
S-Sadly, sir, you can't.
- What do you mean I can't?
- It's illegal, sir.
This fish is protected by the great state of California.
Gimme it!
No?
What are you doing?
Why can't I have the things that I want?
- Sorry about that.
- Don't look at the fish, kids.
You can't have any of them!
None of them are for sale!
Love is a lie.
It is.
- Calm down!
- Love is a lie.
Love is a lie.
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
Schmidt, no.
Absolutely not.
No!
I don't trust fish.
They breathe water-- that's crazy.
Yeah, he's got a whole thing going.
Schmidt-- an aquarium?
!
When did you become a Bond villain that couldn't afford not to live with roommates?
This is where I will keep my lionfish.
- Your lionfish?
- A rare beauty.
The result of generations of interracial fish breeding.
Just undulating in that water with that wry smile.
Perfect, round fish breasts.
- Pull it together.
- What is this hat?
They say it'll be impossible for me to have it.
But I'll get it.
She will be mine, and we will create a life together.
- We're not talking about fish here, are we?
- No.
- Clearly talking about Cece.
- Yes.
Yeah, 'cause he said "fish breasts".
- He said "fish breasts".
- Yeah.
I mean, fish don't have boobs.
Hmm?
- Hey, Jess.
- That's my name.
What's yours?
Just kidding.
I know what it is.
It's Nick.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- You haven't stopped moving - since we've been talking.
- Hmm?
It's a nice-looking dress.
You look good in it.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Jess!
Jess, wait!
Jess Jess, would you please wait?
Hey, I was wondering, can I get a ride to the hardware store?
I want to throw a punching bag up at the bar for Guys' Night, but my car's not working, so can I get a ride?
- No.
Mm-mm.
No.
- Come on, can I please have a ride?
Wait, hold on.
Don't move.
Hold on.
- You got an eyelash.
- Why do you - smell so good?
- It's 'cause I did laundry.
Ah.
I smell like a baby in a damn meadow.
- Look at this.
My underwear.
- What?
What?
-They're blue now.
I think it's 'cause I put colors in the whites.
- Uh-huh.
I'm still figuring it out, but I'm really excited about laundry.
- Good job.
- Hey, how do you put your underwear back in?
Just I feel like it's too big to get back in now.
It's tricky to get it in.
- Fine!
- Thank you.
Do you mind if we stop along the way?
I'm thinking of getting a salad 'cause I want to eat healthier.
Oh!
God!
Nick!
I'm thinking - of taking a vitamin today.
- Oh, God!
Shut up!
It's good.
Yeah.
Yank that chain.
Yank it.
I feel like Russell Crowe in every movie he's ever done.
- All right, Nick.
Um, we have to go.
- We just got here.
- We have tons of stuff we need to get.
- Fine.
- Let me see what we have left.
- A whole bunch of stuff.
Long-shafted drive drill?
New nut wrench?
Our old nut wrench is bad.
Quick-hardening caulk.
You don't want to wait forever for that caulk to harden.
Lube for drill shaft.
And we-- also, can we get a box of gummy sharks?
Just remember you caught him pleasuring himself to a mail-order steak catalogue.
Hey, Jess, I need the cart!
Look what I found!
Look at this big ol' pipe.
Check it out, Schmidt-- I got you a clownfish.
I don't want some janky freshwater bitch fish, Winston.
I want a lionfish.
Let's just cut through the crap, okay, Schmidt?
We both know what you really want is Cece.
- Cece the woman?
- Yeah.
You can't put a woman in a fish tank, Winston.
That doesn't make any sense.
Look, Winston, if there was one thing that stood between you and happiness, don't you think I would be there to help you get it?
- No matter how stupid it was?
- You're right, Schmidt.
If I was doing something stupid, you definitely would be involved.
Yeah, you're damn right I would be.
And I would probably be there to make it even stupider.
Now, I'm going to walk out that door, and I'm gonna pursue the object of my dreams.
And if you don't want to join me, then I'm gonna carry that weight alone.
I'm in.
Let's get you a lionfish.
Where do we start?
- We're gonna start at the source.
- The ocean.
That's an even better idea.
Hey, Jess.
I got some hot soup.
I feel good Jessy feel good Mmm.
I like to say words with my mouth.
Well, your jaw is super bruised, so you need to get some rest.
But you have some fun pain meds.
Right?
- I like you.
- Yeah, I like you, too, Jess.
- Yeah and I like, your little bubble belly.
- Oh, thank you.
Blows up like a bubble.
Yeah, that's what it does.
I want to have sex with you!
Okay.
I want to have sex with you.
Whoa, do you know what you're saying right now, Jess?
Yeah.
Are you sure?
I want to have sex with you.
Sexy time for you, says me.
You are a beautiful white man, Nick Miller.
Okay.
- Read all about it.
- Yeah.
- I'm Judy Garland.
- Yeah, so it's the pills.
This is nonsense.
Whoa!
Jess, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no Heck, no no - Don't do this right now.
- I'm Judy Garland.
Hey, Judy, let's get you to bed, doll.
Whoa, whoa!
You are way too drugged-up for this okay This little piggy went to the market.
- That little piggy can't be touched by you right now.
- This little piggy went this little piggy went to market!
It's hot!
I put my hand in the hot soup!
Ow!
You aah!
Hey, Nick!
Will you be a doll and get me some mustard?
That is not flattering on you.
You're an incredibly lovely man.
- Are you calling my phone?
- Yeah, I'm calling it right now, Winston.
I can't find it.
Are you kidding me?
Damn it, Winston!
- It took me 20 minutes to fit this thing over your hips.
- Whoa, okay.
Hey!
Hey!
- Careful!
Hey!
What are you - Why is your waist so weird?
- That's my ass cheek!
Sch-Schmidt!
- I'm getting your phone.
- That kind of tickles.
- Hey!
Stop saying "That's my ass cheek" and stop touching his butt!
- Look at that shiner.
- Not cool!
Somebody messes with my boy, that means we mean "bid-ness"!
We doing this?
Let's do this!
Are we not are we not doing it?
It doesn't feel like - you guys want to do it.
- Let's just say hypothetically that a girl says something to you while she's on painkillers.
- Mm-hmm.
- And that girl says that she might want to have sexual intercourse with you.
Please tell me we're not talking about Jess.
And you had no idea that's how she felt.
Like, no idea.
You thought the door was closed.
In fact, you thought that door was so closed that you went out to another door, but had I known that the first door was open, that's the door I wanted to walk through.
- Wait, okay, wait - I would've walked through that door.
Do you see how I'm in a tough spot?
Can we stop calling it "walking through a door"?
Because for me, I feel like it's more like sliding past a drape.
Okay, if a girl on painkillers says that she wants to have sex with you, - Mm-hmm.
- is that the drugs or is that real?
And if so, how do I end it with Shane before Jess finds out?
I-I-I meant the door.
Nick, Jess All right, good talking, guys.
- Good stuff.
Yeah, I love that.
- Hey, guys.
What happened to your eye?
You smashed me in the face, remember?
- Right here.
- That's funny.
Seriously, what happened?
Is your jaw okay?
I bit my face.
Oh, you know what?
I can't even feel it.
The doctor's got me so goofy on these painkillers, it's like it never happened.
It's like it never happened.
But I sure got a chin shiner.
Yeah, you do.
- Right?
So, I'll see you at Guys' Night.
- Uh, no, no, no, you - I don't - I think you should rest.
- Yeah, girl, you gotta protect that face.
Yeah, hey, for real, you should stay home and you should rest, Jess.
That's so sweet.
Thanks, guys.
What are doing out here?
This is crazy.
We've been standing in the ocean for two hours trying to steal an illegal fish.
I don't know why you want that damn fish so bad.
But what I do know is that it's gonna make you happy.
And that's all I care about.
Remember, I'm the one who shaved your shoulders after you got that scoop-neck sweater.
- I appreciate it.
- I'd do the same to find whatever it is that makes you happy.
You want to lose that last 55 pounds, I'll help you do that.
I don't got 50 pounds to lose.
It's very evident in this outfit.
Right there.
I see something.
Lionfish!
Son of a - What the?
- Jellyfish!
- What?
- Jellyfish!
Whoa, Schmidt.
- Jellyfish!
- What happened?
- It got me, it got me!
- What do I do?
- What do I do?
- It got me, Winston!
- It burns!
- Okay!
- Burns!
- So what do I do?
- I need you to pee on my face.
- What?
- You need to pee on my face.
- I can't.
It will sterilize the wound.
Please do it, Winston.
I can not pee on your face.
I thought you were with me to the end.
I just peed in the ocean, so I'm all out.
You peed in the ocean?
- Yeah, look - Disgusting!
Okay, look, look, I know this is a dumb question, but will number two help?
What?
Free beers, Gorilla Bowl of nachos.
Gonna be two dozen dollars, boys.
Didn't realize we could make a $22 profit on nachos.
- Guys' Night is genius.
- Right?
Hey, um, look, uh, I think you're great, I just, uh, I can't keep I can't keep running to get cheese every time somebody orders nachos.
I love how worked up you get over cheese.
Get down there.
Run.
Ooh who do I have to do around here to get a bucket of nachos?
Right here.
Right here.
How you doing?
- I wasn't serious.
- Wendell.
Hi.
Gentlemen There's a really literal - vibe around here.
- What are you doing here?
This morning you said you weren't coming, Jess.
I actually don't remember this morning at all.
- But I would never miss this.
I'm so proud of you.
- Free beers!
Free beer.
You guys went through those!
- Wait a minute - More free beers.
Guys' Night is men drink for free?
- Well, it's Guys' Night.
- Oh.
You know I it's not a really good idea.
You know, because women won't show up, and You know?
He's our little idea man.
- Hey - So full of ideas.
She just slap your ass?
Sure.
She's like a she's my boss and like a coach.
We're a team here.
We all slap each other's butts all the time.
Right here!
Keep up the good work!
Why don't you go get us some ice, Big Bob?
Just slap my butt, Big Bob.
Show me some butt love.
Fire me off!
Some butt love?
Take a slice of that.
Oh, you got right up in there.

- No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're sleeping together.

- We're all sleeping together.
Big Bob is I'm sorry, Jess.
Why I mean, why are you sorry?
You're a free man.
Just you're just you know getting some stank on it.
Did you really just say that to me in my own bar?
- Nick, who is this?
- Yeah, Nick, who am I?
Shane, this is Jess.
She's my, uh - Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Hmm my room friend.
I'm your "room friend," Nick?
Jess, don't I'm sleeping with Nick, too.
You don't have to do this, Bob.
I have to go.
Big Bob, that was really sweet.
Thank you, Bob!
Jess, wait!
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?
He left me a voicemail from the ambulance.
He was rambling a lot, but I brought him this.
- Whoa, where'd you get that?
- You know, one of the perks of being a model.
You get to meet a lot of sketchy people.
The guy who got me this also said he could get me a box of dolphin steaks or a mostly white baby.
Good to know.
How's he doing?
Uh, hey, listen, I think it might be good for him if you just gave him some space.
Space?
Cece, you're getting married.
It's killing him.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- Um, just tell him I came - Mm-hmm.
- by, or or not.
- Uh-huh.
He's waking up.
You should go.
- Okay.
- You know roommate.
Winston.
Hmm?
I just realized something.
It was never about a fish.
It was a metaphor.
It was about Cece.
Don't feel bad about not seeing it.
Look, man, it was subtle as hell.
Oh, my God, is that a lionfish?
Where'd that come from?

- Shut up, Nick.
- It's something you were just saying, that's fine, that's cool, we'll move on and not talk about it, but it is something that I've thought a lot about.
But you were never clear about that, so that there were other options.
And this little piggy ran around to different markets, but he didn't know.
What are you talking about?
Do you want to have sex with me, yes or no?
Yes!
No!

You're a frickin' gold digger, Jess.
- What?

If I were a gold digger, do you think I'd be interested in you?
I would be the worst gold digger in the world.
You're a friggin' gold digger.
No, I'm not, Nick.
- I'm so disappointed in you.

Then prove it.

"Me so horny".
Very good.
"No credit, no problem"!
And "Happy 100th, Jane"!
I don't think she made it, but she lived a good life.
Shut up!
Who booby-trapped me?
Stop!
Shut up!
It's my mom.
Get off of me!
- Yeah, Mom, hey.
- Nick's just mad 'cause that punk-ass balloon beat his ass.
Hey, no huffing.
Come on, guys.
Take these seriously, Winston.
I didn't buy the balloons to have you guys If you do that one more time, I'm gonna break your faces in.
Uh, my dad died.

I got to go back to, uh, Chicago and, uh, go to the funeral and everything.
Well, are you guys gonna say anything or - That's terrible, Nick.

Stay strong.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
So this is where Nick Miller grew up.
Well, except for the fall of '88 to spring of '89.
That was our van year.
I just want you to know - I am here for you.
- Okay.
I'm gonna be strong for you, man.
You know, I really did love Walt.
He was my dad, Winston.
Yeah, but, I mean, he loved me more than he loved you.
- He told me that.
- Yeah, he told me that, too, actually.
Sorry.
- You okay, Schmidt?
- I didn't want to make this about me, but the airline lost my bag.
I wanted to look fantastic for your father's funeral.
Now I have nothing but the schmatta on my back.
All right.
Let's do this.
Uh, Jess, we should warn you.
Nick's family-- a little crazy.
- It's called pop!
- Just call it soda.
- It's soda, all right?
- It's not!
It's not!
Hey, Uncle Nicky.
Hey, man.
- No, it's called soda.

- I mean, why?
- I know.
I know.
You been you been crying a bunch, buddy?
- No.
- He'll get your shoulder all wet, too.
Hey, look, don't do the hair-pull.
It's so intimate.
- You okay?
- I'm not okay!
Jamie, here's what I need you to do: Grab a bunch of kids and teach them how to build a snowman outside.
I can't do that!
I already did it already!
- He put the carrot in the crotch.
- Why'd you put the carrot in the crotch?
- 'Cause they told me to!
- They're kids.
Those kids are cool!
I wanted to hang out!
Don't trust cops.
Nicky!
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh.
Oh.
I miss him, Nicky.
- Yeah, I know, Ma.
- That bastard was a saint.
A saint.
The bastard.
I know.
Come here.
Hey.
This is getting very personal.
May Maybe none of us should go to the funeral.
The early buzz on this thing is that it's gonna be a real drag.
So what still needs to get done?
We need to, uh, get the groceries, - uh, plan the funeral, call the paper - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Did you say "plan the funeral"?
That's why you're here, Nicky.
You take care of everything.
- I got the napkins!
- Oh, that's so hot.
- Great, Jamie.
- Is Nick taking care of people?
Yeah, with Pop-Pop coming and going, Nick had to step up and be the man of the family.
Pretty much takes care of all of them.
Don't laugh when they call him responsible.
They don't know why that's hilarious.
Um Oh Hi, Mrs. Miller.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
- If there's anything I can do to help, I - Who are you?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Jess.
- This is Jess, my new roommate.
- Um, so nice to meet you.
- I've told you about her.
Winnie and Fat Schmidt I know.
Hey, boys.
I just wanted to say that I'm here and happy - to do anything.
- Is she a Spanish?
Um I'm from Portland, Oregon.
Land of books.
Trailblazers.
Hmm.
Are you guys, uh - Jamie, I'm begging you to shut up.
- Your father always wanted to have a funeral just like Elvis had, so that's what we're gonna give him.
- A funeral like Elvis had?
- That means and an Elvis impersonator Dad's gonna get the funeral you want him to have, okay?
So tell me what needs to get done, and I'll just do it.
Oh, the eulogy.
You - you'll do the eulogy, right?
- Oh I don't think I should do it.
You just say a bunch of nice stuff all in a row.
- Do it, College.
You got it.
- Nick, you have to.
- You should do it.
- Come on, Nicky.
You should do it.
Do a good poem.
Do one of your good ones.
Come on, man.
You got to.
Yeah, okay.
Sure.
I'll, uh That's my boy.
He takes care of everything.
- Hey.
- Hey, Jess.
It's like a whole secret life for you.
You're not even looking at the numbers.
Aunt Ruthie used to call this the Iron Jew.
Wow.
Are you having time to process this?
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure out the level of Elvis impersonator we can afford.
Uh-huh.
And I think a white one's out of reach.
Is there anything I could do to help?
- The eulogy.
- Sorry?
Oh, that would be really helpful 'cause that's been getting in my way a little bit.
I didn't really know your dad except the one hour that I committed fraud with him.
That's all there is to know, really.
I think that's, you know, one task I think maybe is better if you Look, I've got to figure out an Elvis theme.
You know, Elvis-themed flowers and food and music all in a day.
I just You asked if there was anything you could do, and there is.
Okay.
- Yay!
Thank you.
- I'll do it.
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are the best.
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah.
For Elvis-themed music, what about Elvis?
I'm really I'm so slammed right now.
I can't hear, like, new stuff.
Looking good, man.
This was Walt's best suit.
Look at all these buttons, Winston.
I look like a remote control.
- It looks good.
- I can't mourn in this.
- I don't even know how to use these buttons.
- Hey, look, we're not mourning, okay?
This is a celebration, you know?
That's what funerals are about Winston, I just can't go to the funeral, okay?
- I don't want to go!
- What the hell is the problem?
Look, I really want to support Nick.
I do.
I want to support his family.
I want to be there for him, but I'm scared of death.
Uh wow.
Uh Schmidt, you know, death is natural, you know?
It's a natural part of life.
Everybody's scared of death.
Death, Winston.
Death.
Death.
And let me ask you something, Winston: What's with this open casket thing?
All of a sudden, I-I got to walk in and I got to see the carcass?
That's crazy.
What if what if his eyes open?
What if his eyes open, and then he comes and haunts all of us?
Why do Why Literally, why are the buttons on here?
Because they're not holding anything together, yet I don't know which buttons are buttoned.
How do you get this thing off, Winston?
!
I don't understand this middle-class button system!
Get it off of me!
So I don't think I'm gonna go to the funeral, man.
I think I'm gonna hang back.
So, um, I'm helping Nick with the eulogy.
I'll give you the goods on Walt, Glasses Face.
My pop had a table at every diner in the city.
He had silverware from the finest hotels in the area.
He had a gold chain as thick as floss.
But, like, thick floss.
Wait, Walt's got that chain?
Yeah, he got that chain.
That's his chain.
That was my dad's chain.
No, it was Walt's signature piece.
No, he got that from the Seiko watch deal.
No, he got it from the dishwasher arrangement.
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.
My dad took a dart in the eye for that.
I don't care what your dad took a dart - in the eye for.
- Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.
- Can we refocus?
- I can't!
- Because he's accusing my father of thievery!
- Hey!
- Can we just talk about Walt?
- Yeah, so what's the deal with you and Nick?
Are you guys, uh Could you could you stop doing that with your eyebrows?
Please stop doing Stop.
- They're doing it.
They're doing it.
- Yeah.
- No.
- Whoever denied it supplied it.
Now, this would be the casket.
And now I'm dead.
- So approach me and don't be afraid.
- Just promise not to move, all right?
- That's what I'm afraid of most.
- Are you k are you kidding me?
- Also, you can't breathe.
- Schmidt, I need to breathe, okay?
Because I'm coaching you, and also for regular life reasons.
Now, just calm down, find a joyful memory and let it lift you to the sky.
You left us too soon, - you beautiful black butterfly.
- Start over.
You know, when we first met, I thought that we would be rivals.
For Nick's attention, for who wore Easter colors best.
And then rivalry became friendship.
We've laughed, we've swum.
You cut my toenails.
Are you the brother that I never had?
No.
- You're the brother that I've always had.
- That was beautiful.
What are you doing, man?
!
- You moved!
Whoa!
What the hell?
Of course I moved!
I'm not a real dead person!
- You ghoul!
- Why do I do this for you?
Forget it, man.
I'm never going to this thing.
- You just made it worse.
- What's wrong with you?
$2,000?
What if it wasn't six feet under?
- How much for three feet?
- I've gone through half a pack of ciggie gum here.
- You want some of my weed?
- Where are we on the food?
We-we got to have Elvis food.
- Ma, I'm making calls right now.
- It's got to be perfect.
- It's gonna be perfect.
You just got to let me do it.
- If the food isn't Elvis-themed, - does it matter that much?
- You got a problem with Elvis?
- I don't - No, she didn't say that.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
- No, she didn't say that.
She didn't say that about Elvis.
- I was just suggesting that maybe the Elvis theme doesn't matter as much You don't think Elvis is important?
- She knows Elvis is important, Ma!
- Elvis is everything!
I know.
He's the King.
He's the King.
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
He's the King.
- Jess.
- Nick - I'm here to help, but I can't write this eulogy.
- Wait, what?
- Do you want some of my weed?
- I asked you to do one thing.
- I need you to write the eulogy.
- But I didn't know Walt.
Nobody wants to hear what I have to say about my dad.
It doesn't matter what you say.
You just you h you have to say good-bye to him.
I'm not asking you to do too much.
Just write my father's eulogy.
I can't handle this!
- Nick.
- My dad's chain!
- Nick.
- I want that chain!
Hey, Nick!
Nick!
He popped me right in my cherry!
That's not what that means, Jamie!
- Then what does it mean?
!
- Nick!
Where are you going?
I forgot my jacket.
It's really cold outside!
Nick, wait!
Ow!
- Hey.
- Hey.
When's the last time you saw Nick?
- Is he not here?
- What are you guys talking about?
Schmidt, if you want to hear what we're saying, - come over here.
- Don't shout across the room.
It's bad luck to see the body before the funeral.
No, that's, like, a wedding thing, Schmidt.
Shh.
I think I said something to Nick.
I think this is my fault.
Hey, everybody!
I brought Elvis!
- Funeral saved.
- What?
- Hey, happy funeral, Jess.
- What happened?
What happened is I found this guy at the bar and he fits into the costume, so for 20 bucks, he's gonna be Elvis.
I thought you wanted me to kill Elvis for 20 bucks.
Then why would I give you the outfit, Brendan?
The element of surprise?
Yeah.
- The mirror effect?
- He's gonna be perfect.
- Mmm.
Whose birthday is it?
No, it's my dad's funeral.
I'm gonna go find cake.
How much have you had to drink?
One dozen beers.
And I wrote I did what you asked me to do, Jessica.
- I wrote the, uh, gigleography.
- The what?
- The gigleography.
- A "gigleography"?
Urology.
Elegy?
Eulogish.
You wrote the eulogy.
That's what I've been saying the whole time-- it's right here.
"Walt Miller.
Am I right"?
Am I right?
Am I right?
- That's terrible.
- Googaliogy!
All right, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna sober up Nick and and Elvis.
You, go buy us some time.
All right, Schmidt, stop asking people - if they can smell the body.
That is rude.
- I'll try.
- It's inappropriate and it's offensive, okay?
- Okay, but I just - All right?
It's what I - it's what I'm thinking.
I got this.
Shh.
I got this.
- Just don't say anything, okay?
Come on.
- Hi Uh the chain.
Some someone should stop 'Cause he's taking the chain.
Hey, hey, quit it, man.

You're mad at me.
You've got the mad face.
I'm not mad at you, Nick.
I'm not mad at you.
I have your back.
No matter what, no matter how stupid it gets, and you and I both know it can get really, really stupid.
- I am the stupidest of all the stupid boys.
- No.
I'm gonna be there, and I'm gonna hold your hand, and I wanted to tell you that last night, but you ran away.
Yeah.
I want to meet your mom.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Elvis!
What are we going to do, Winnie?
- Everyone's waiting.

Everybody sit down.
This is the King.

Dad would've liked this.
He would've faked a slip and fall and sued the funeral home.
But he would've liked this.
Thank you, Jess.
You're welcome, Mama.
Oh I used to always tell my dad that I hated Elvis just to piss him off.
And he would get really mad the way Walt could get really mad.
And, uh, he would turn it up loud just to spite me and sing all the Elvis songs.
He was very good at gambling.
He had a great mustache.
- Hey, man.
- What?
And he was so mean to cabbies in such a cool way.
And he never was scared.
How did he do that?
I don't know if Walt was a good guy or a bad guy in the whole scheme of things, you know.
But he was my dad, and I'm sure gonna miss him.
You okay, Mama?
Yeah, I'm gonna be okay, Mama.

Watching TV-- cool.
Cool.
Where do you think you're going?
That charger belongs to all of us.
- Nowhere.
- Oh, really?
Because it looks like you're going to your room to charge when it's not your turn.
You know the rules, dumb-dumb.
Charger stays in a neutral room.
Why do we only have one charger anyway?
It was supposed to bring us closer together.
Hey, look, another charger.
- Take him!
- Get him!
- Get down!
You guys get him started, I'll finish him off.
- Just so many dude butts.
- Watch my face, man.
That's my face.
Watch my face.
Hey, that's the moneymaker.
No, I'm gonna stop him, I'm gonna stop - Get No!
- You are terrible at this.
Oh, you can't outrun the Jewish.
That was stupid.
They are such idiots.
I don't know why I do this.
The charger doesn't even fit on my phone.
I have, like, six chargers in my room.
I just do this for fun.
It's funny.
Well, here we are by ourselves.
What should we do?
- Uh, definitely not make out.
- Definitely not.
Your hand's on my boob.
Yeah.
And it's weird.
Maybe it's less weird because I know that it's weird-- I'm calling it out.
Doesn't make it less weird.
- Right on.
- So you're an upper-boob guy.
That's the most underrated part of the boob.
It's what I've always said.
Can I ask you a question?
- Please.
- What's going on here?
- Yeah.
- What are we?
- We, us?
- What are we doing?
Yeah.
We are roommates, who have made out a couple of times, and are attracted to each other.
- Mm-hmm.
- And really good friends.
- Yeah.
And sometimes genuinely kind of hate each other.
And sometimes touch each other's boobs.
- Little bit better - Not helping.
- Little bit worse?
- Yeah.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
New Girl S02E21 First Date Would you describe this as a sexual act?
I would describe that as the pledge of allegiance, which can be sexual.
Why?
Because this is what I got from Nick.
Just out of the blue.
No reason.
Our relationship's so confusing.
But this is Nick we're talking about.
He's never gonna tell me how he feels.
It's always gonna be weird.
And I have to stop expecting for it to change.
What?
You realize your hand is still on your boob, right?
I can't explain it, it's it's, like, really calming me down.
I mean, the sexual tension has been off the charts.
It's like the wild west.
No laws.
Whiskey for a nickel.
Whores caked in mud.
I don't know what to do.
You're always there when I need you, Tran.
Thank you.
I'm glad you got no life.
I'm joking.
Would you settle down?
My father just died.
I don't know, life's short, huh?
It just kind of I got to start doing things, Tran.
Making moves, grown-up moves.
I don't know, I want things.
I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.
What's my move with Jess?
What would you do?
Of course you would, you dirty dog.
Well, in reality, Tran, what would do if you were me?
A date?
What if that's not what she wants?
What if she oh!
What if she?
All right, you're right-- no second-guessing.
I got to be confident, I've got to be clear.
Women like that.
All right, I just got to say Jessica, you are a beautiful woman, and my life has not been the same since I met you.
And it would mean the world to me if you would, uh go on a date with me.
Hey, Nick.
Jess ica.
Dirty J, Dr. day, my toilet sister.
If so, food.
You want to get food later?
I'm gonna get dressed now.
Okay, bye.
- Did you put the charger the bathroom?
- The most neutral room in the loft.
- Yeah, well, I moved it to the kitchen.
- The kitchen?
- Hey, guys.
- Nick, what's more neutral?
The awesome bathroom or the stupid, stupid kitchen?
I have a lot of thoughts on this, but first, Schmidt, I have a favor.
- It's about my clothes.
- Burn them, burn them all.
No, no, no, no, no, I have a date tonight, and, you know, there's a lot of women who sleep with you, and I can't figure out why, so maybe it's about clothes, and maybe Are you asking me if I'll help you pick out clothing so you can seduce a woman?
- I was.
I don't know.
It's only all I've been wanting for the past ten years, Nick.
Yes, that is how you wrap a son of a bitch in wool.
Now, if somebody asks you who you're wearing tonight, what do you say?
Do it, bro.
- I don't want to do that.
- I don't want to do that.
- Do it.
- I'm wearing Schmidt.
Yeah.
- Yeah, you are.
And neckscape by Winston.
Oh whoa, who is that handsome devil?
Okay, now, here's some things you want to hide about yourself on tonight's date, okay?
- Definitely, yeah.
That you're cheap, you're a heavy drinker, you're broke and you have a problem with anger.
Your car is horrible.
So go ahead and take my new Foscapay.
What's a Foscapay?
Uh, Ford Escape.
I'm still work-shopping nicknames.
- By the way, who's the girl?
- Who's the girl?
- Who's the girl?
Yeah.
- Uh, what's her name?
It's, uh, yeah, it's, uh Her name is, uh, obviously Yolanda.
Uh her last name is Winston.
- I should go.
- Oh, I love latino girls.
Yolanda Winston.
Schmidt, that's a fake name.
Yeah, but why would he lie about Oh, my God.
- Nick is a male escort.
- Jess - Probably not a Yeah.
- Jess, man.
Do you realize what it means if Jess and Nick become a couple?
Nick is our glue, man.
You know, without him, it just doesn't work-- it never has.
See what I mean?
He's awesome, man.
This is my, one of my best friends, too.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Nick Nick All of our stories start and end with Nick.
What if Nick decides he's gonna leave us?
Well, you know what we have to do, right?
We're gonna track Jess down and kill her with this knife.
- We have to sabotage the date.
Or we do your thing.
Let's do your thing.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
What are you doing over there by the hot dogs?
You gave me the address, I just assumed we were eating at the hot dog stand.
- No - Why are you wearing a suit?
Did you just apply for a loan or something?
No, I'm, uh I'm wearing Schmidt.
You're wear you're wearing what?
I'm wearing Schmidt, uh Winston shaved my face.
Weird.
Well, come on, let's get some dinner.
- Come on, I got a reservation.
- Come on.
What?
Hi, there, sir.
Afraid, uh, you apparently didn't see the crosswalk was over there.
Oh, let's not sweat the small stuff, officer.
I'm walking across the street.
- Afraid I'm gonna have to write you up for jaywalking.
- Stay calm, make tiny fists with your toes.
- I'm really sorry about this.
- Jess, I'm not upset.
This man is merely doing his job.
You were right, I was wrong.
Here you go, sir.
Thank you, officer.
$340?
!
Yeah, I know it's a lot.
They raised it last year, I think.
Have a good night, ma'am.
- All right, just scram.
- You too, sir.
Dinner?
- Okay.
- Okay.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Very lovely.
What an establishment.
It's my favorite in the city.
Right on time.
Oh Keep it coming.
Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?
What's on your mind?
Well, I'm just asking if this is a date.
- What do you mean, "is this a date"?
- I'm just I'm asking you if this is a date.
It seems like a date.
You've been thinking it's a date this whole time?
- I'm just asking you.
- How embarrassing for you.
No, for me, it's just hanging out in a suit, getting champagne with my friend.
I think we're ready to order.
I have an idea-- I'm gonna have the bartender send over two tropical cocktails.
Jess will be all, "Why, thank you".
Nick will be all, "Grandpa didn't get a face full of Japanese bullets just so you could drink a melted popsicle".
Or we could break into a zoo, steal a bear, then we shoot that bear full of Hep C, and then we release that bear in the restaurant right when they order dessert.
- Winston, you're terrible at pranks.
- I get that.
You don't think just a bear alone in a restaurant is enough?
- You know who would know what to do?
- I do know who would know what to do.
- Nick.
- Nick.
We can't call him, right?
Ooh.
They have, uh, Brussels sprouts with pancetta.
That's a fancy name for bacon.
Hold the Brussels sprouts.
Am I right?
Everybody loves bacon, Jess-- New topic.
You know, um - If this were a date - Yeah, but it wasn't, Jess - But, I mean, if it were - It wasn't a And it's probably good because your ex-boyfriend just walked into the restaurant.
- Who?
- The only man we both loved.
Russell.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Hi, so this is why you dumped me, huh?
- Oh, well - No Just kidding.
I'm glad to see this is finally happening.
- Nothing's happening, so - Nothing's happening because I was never told it was happening, so if a happening happens and you don't know that it happened, did it happen, you know?
Right on.
Um, hey, enjoy my lucky table.
I'm Brandy.
Okay.
You know what?
Can we just forget about this date, or not-date, and Maybe start over and go get a drink at the bar as friends?
Drinking to forget?
That's my sweet spot.
- Let's do that.
- Okay.
These clothes are so uncomfortable.
Glad to get it off.
In there.
You ready to drink with a friend?
- I am, Jess.
- Yes.
Let's do this.
Why isn't the crosswalk here?
Just let it out.
- Just let it out.
- This is where people want to cross, sir.
We don't need our table.
We're sitting at the bar.
Not a date.
Your table's all yours-- not on a date.
I think we're doing too much brainstorming and not enough good old-fashioned remembering.
What's the worst thing that you've ever experienced on a date?
I will be your father figure put your tiny hand in mine I will be your preacher teacher Anything you have in mind I will be your father figure I have had enough of crime I will be the one who loves you Till the end of time.
Outside Dave, my friend Winston here holds in his hands the lyrics to sir George Michael's "Father Figure".
- I'm familiar.
- What's it gonna take for you to lose the shirt and go ruin a date for us?
We're willing to pay you handsomely.
Four million U.S. dollars and a trip to wine country.
I don't have $4 million.
All right, give him that.
I'll tell you what.
and two home-cooked sandwiches.
One home-cooked sandwich.
- Deal.
- Yeah, deal.
Okay, Outside Dave.
Make yourself at home here on the couch, and I'll get started on those sandwiches To the laboratory!
Diversion!
Two urinals?
I'm rich!
You both have jobs.
Get another charger.
I love those guys, but they're idiots.
- They are idiots.
- They are so dumb.
To their credit, they don't go around randomly grabbing each other's boobs.
- That we know of.
- Randomly?
Oh, no way.
You put it out there, Jess.
- What?
- Yes, you do.
I do not put it out there.
"Hey, Nick, will you help me open this jar"?
What?
- Yes.
- I can't open the jar.
"How do you restart the Internet"?
That's just me suffering through life.
You have to stop, because it's ridiculously hot.
Okay?
It's hard for me to deal with, 'cause it's too hot.
All right, fine.
Then you have to stop gargling your beer.
- That's a turn-on?
- It's hot.
- That is so weird, that that's a turn-on.
- You're like Might as well be in, like, a like a hose, spraying you down.
You are out of your mind.
Hey.

Guys, so sorry.
Curveball.
We need the table back.
We are on a date.
- We are on a date.
- Amazing.
Hey, Marc, could you clear the table but leave the breadsticks?
Actually, don't clear the table, 'cause that looks good.
Could you clear the fish?
I don't want to be too forward, but whatever baby wants, baby gets.
Daddy's buying.
Well, look, you keep buying my drinks, I'll put out no matter what you say.
- Ooh.
- I guess the good ones aren't all married or gay.
How many have we had?
Ooh!
Hey, Russell!
Nice to see you!
Date's going really well.
That's that's great news.
- Really, really nice to see you guys.
- Yeah.
You two are really something.
"Really something".
What does that mean?
- Hmm.
- You know, we're having a great date.
- Right?
- Who cares what he thinks?
- Who cares what he says?
- I don't agree.
- Hey!
Hey, Russell!
- Hey!
- Oh, God.
Where's my car?
- Hey, you said we were - "really something" and we want to know what that means.
- What does that mean?
- Yeah.
- This may come as a shock, but I have no opinion about you two.
Did you valet?
God, that is classy.
You know what?
You can't just tell two people that they're "really something" and just walk away.
Fine.
You-you want to know what I meant?
- Yes!
- You live together and you had three dates tonight.
What's that?
I think you guys don't really know what you are to each other.
Right?
- Well, you're wrong.
No, you're wrong.
Yeah.
- You are wrong, because we know what we are We do know yeah.
We know what we are.
Okay, this'll be fun.
Tell you what.
Why don't you write it down?
Seriously.
Write down what you think this is.
Is this a relationship, a one-night stand, above the waist only?
No wrong answers.
- You had two pens on you this whole time?
- Well, sure.
- That's the move right there.
- You better believe it.
This is so much better than the gutter!
I'm calling the Police, I'm calling the D.A., I'm calling somebody.
- Mmm, smells like ladies in here.
- Damn it.
My battery's dead.
Yeah, mine, too.
Where is the charger?
Schmidt, you put the charger back in the bathroom?
I'm sorry, okay?
I thought it was the neutralest room.
Three, two, one zero!
- Let's just go, Brandy.
- Wait.
No, no, no, no.
- Don't go.
Yeah, I got it, too.
Me, too.
- I got this, I got this.
There it is.
Okay.
Figured it out.
- Good.
Great.
- Great.
- Okay.
Y-you know what?
This wasn't such a good idea.
Maybe just forget I thought of it.
- We're just gonna go.
All right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
It's best that way.
- What did you write?
- What did you write?
- Russell, Russell, hey.

Excuse me, sir.
The crosswalk geez.
Sorry.
Oh, my gosh.
Hair sauce!
- Hair sauce?
Oh, my God.
- Mmm, feels like mud.
If he even looks at my pomade caddy, I will turn every hobo in the city against him.
I will poison every pie on every windowsill.
He doesn't steal pies from windowsills.
He is a real-life homeless person.
We need to call the cops.
Oh, I'm sorry, we can't.
You know why?
- Yeah, your phone's dead.
- Because of you, Schmidt.
You want to know why I'd rather hang out with Nick?
- Shh.
What is that?
- Time to cut the grass.
He's using my four-in-one groomer.
I'm going in there.
- No!
Schmidt!
Absolutely not!
- I'm going in there, man.
You hear that?
Because that that is not the fourth use.
- There's no sanctioned fifth use!
- Hey, Schmidt!
Schmidt!
- Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me!
- He's using it for a fifth use!
Nick is gonna be home soon.
Okay?
And then everything will be fine.
- Nick will know what to do.
- There's no time.
- I'm going to the roof.
- What are you Schmidt, why are you going up - Oh, my gosh, it's full of bugs.
Nick, I need to know how you feel.
What did you write on that card?
Well, what did you write on your card?
- Let's say it at the same time, - Okay.

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Oh, my God!
What is that?
I don't want to hear it, okay?
My mother sent it to me.
It belonged to my father.
We have the same exact butt.
- What are you wearing?
- What are you wearing?
I'm dressed for my Booty Burn Boot Camp class.
I know what you're thinking.
It's not because I need it.
I go to inspire the others.
Please take that thing off.
You look like a homeless pencil.
I will not take it off.
I have a pass.
- A pass?
What kind of pass?
- A Dead Dad Pass.
Which means I can do what I want when I want and no one can say anything about it.
Like right now, I want to tap dance, and you, Jess, you cannot tell me that this isn't tap.
Nick, that's just not tap!
- My dad died!
- I'm sorry.
It's just not.
Hey, y'all.
Look at these fancy invites.
Do you think it's to a gala event?
I've always wanted to go - to a gala event.
- Yeah.
What the hell are you wearing?
Dead Dad Pass.
Oh, my God!
It's Cece's wedding.
Wait a minute.
It's in three weeks?
- She didn't tell me it was in three weeks.
- Cece didn't give me a plus-one.
How dare she not give me a plus-one.
You can't invite an ex to a wedding and not give him the dignity of consolation sex.
Girl better recognize.
Schmidty gonna go get his plus-one.
Ew, Nick, what are you doing?
Dead Dad Pass.
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
I have not technically been asked to be maid of honor, but I am throwing Cece's surprise bachelorette party here tonight, and the only males invited are strippers, so oil up or get out, guys.
Seriously though, this is a really big deal for her.
Some girls plan their weddings, Cece planned her bachelorette party.
I want to have the dirtiest bachelorette party of all time.
Then you better have it in a pigpen.
No, I mean I want strippers and a mechanical bull and balloons in the shape of ding dongs, and I want to wear the kind of underwear that goes between your cheeks.
I'm also gonna need your help.
- Oh, God.
We could've left.
- See.
You know what?
We had ample opportunity to leave.
I saw it coming miles away and did nothing.
Me, too.
No.
I just need you to kidnap Shivrang so I can get Cece alone.
Roughhouse him a little bit, drop him off in the desert till he don't breathe no more?
What?
!
I'm so happy you guys could come help.
All the way from India.
Aw, look at all the ladies bonding.
This is so exciting.
You know, Grandmother and Ankita Auntie just couldn't wait to meet you.
Yeah Just a little overwhelmed.
- I'm gonna take a - I know.
Wait, listen.
Look, babe.
Just think.
When all of this madness is over, you and I will finally get to, you know What are you doing?
- Freaking me out.
- You know, make love.
Which I am personally looking forward to greatly.
And we'll already be married forever.
I'll-I'll get it.
Hello Shivrang?
What are you doing here?
I, uh You stole my question.
Hi.
How are you doing?
My invitation didn't have a plus-one.
If this is a mistake, I would just like an apology for the pain that you've caused me.
Also reimbursement for all travel expenses.
Not a mistake.
There's no plus-one.
- Who is this?
- I'm Gérard Depardieu.
Do you think I am, lady?
I'm Schmidt.
- Get in my room right now, Schmidt.
Move.
- I'm going to your room right now.
Hey, you listen to me.
That is my future family, okay?
You cannot speak like that in front of them.
And, no, you cannot have a plus-one.
This wedding has a budget.
Plus-ones are for spouses and serious partners only.
So you just assume that I won't have a serious partner by then?
I know for a fact you won't, okay?
You're not a relationship guy, and that is fine.
I can do anything I put my mind to.
I once figured out Alyssa Milano's phone number just by randomly choosing numbers.
Every girl that I've ever slept with wants to be my girlfriend.
It's just the way that it is.
If you have a real girlfriend by the time of the wedding, - I will happily give you a plus-one.
- Challenge accepted.
- Not a challenge.
- Time to go make some dreams come true.
I Hey, ladies.
I just want to thank you all for coming on such short notice - for Cece's last night of freedom.
- Hi, models.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I'm a lawyer.
Hi.
I'm Sadie.
I'm a lesbian.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi, lesbian.
I'm 39 weeks large right now.
I can't stand for more than 60 seconds but just wanted to say I'm-I'm so excited to be raging with you all.
So bring on the cranberry juice, right?
I need this.
It's really weird.
You're acting really weird.
- So many models.
- I know.
I know.
So many.
You can look.
Don't touch.
One more thing?
I am a doctor if anyone's got any areas they want looked at.
I'm fine to take a peek.
That's too much.
Don't make me call your wife.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Cece's here.
Everybody assume surprise positions!
She's coming.
Cece'soming.
I don't get what's happening.
I'm just gonna run upstairs and quickly grab a CD from Jess.
- I'll come, too.
- That's okay.
I I'll be really fast.
I want to see what your friends are like.
- Have fun.
- Okay.
- It's gonna be great.
It's just Jess.
- Okay.
Bye.
I-I'll be right here.
- Hey.
- Whoa.
Hey, Nick.
Sorry, I thought you were Jane Lynch.
- Jane Lynch.
Nice nice wheels, man.
- Yeah, thank you.
- I'm a bit of a car man myself.
Well, you know I decided to Right on.
- Good for you.
Too far!
Winston!
Oh, take the car.
Take the car.
I'm gonna beat your ass with an athletic stick, boy!
Winston!
Winston!
Jess said to kidnap him, so that's what I'm doing.
It's a figure of speech, you idiot.
- You nervous?
- Uh-huh.
- Surprise!
- Surprise!
It's your bachelorette party!
- Jess, I - Love it?
I know.
Complete with your favorite game, Pin the Dong on the Shivrang!
Pin the dong!
Pin the dong!
- Oh.
Hello.
- Oh.
Um, Jess, this is Ankita-ji, Shivrang's aunt all the way from India.
Hello.
Ankita-ji, this is Jess, my non-blood related best friend.
Welcome to California.
May I please use your restroom?
I need to wash my hands.
Yes, of course.
It's down the hall.
Um, also there's a very sexually aggressive message on the mirror and I apologize for that.
- Pin the dong.
- Pin it.
- I can't.
Come on, Cece.
Get the bull's-eye.
I haven't seen Shivrang's penis.
Oh.
It's that small?
You still know where it goes though.
It just hit me.
I'm about to commit the rest of my life to a man that I have never seen naked.
Cece, chances are he has, like, a standard garden-variety penis.
And if we're all really honest with ourselves, isn't it all about the gonads?
- Am I right, ladies?
- No.
- No.
I'm trying to make her feel better.
And Ankita cannot hear anything about this, all right?
She will not understand.
You guys have to promise to keep it G-rated tonight.
Cece, you've dreamt of this party your whole life.
I wouldn't want to change it.
- No.
- Really?
- I can't.
- Really?
I can't.
Okay.
Cece, what if it looks like an old carrot?
What if it's curly?
- Oh, God.
- If he's using it right, no one's seeing his penis.
Okay, I'm gonna fix this.
So, if Jess is throwing Cece a surprise bachelorette party, does that make this my surprise bachelor party?
You shut that pretty mouth of yours, Romeo, before I fill it with fire!
Hey, you got to ease up, Winston.
I got to go.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, don't.
- I got a call.
- Please.
I need a picture of Shivrang's penis.
- Dead Dad Pass!
New topic!
- Cece's really freaking out.
- She hasn't seen his penis.
- For the love of God, Dead Dad Pass.
And I need it to scale, so please put, like, a nickel or a big toe or a golf pencil in there for reference.
It's not gonna happen!
One picture and you can come home.
Give me 20 minutes.
If you want to end this, we need to get a photo of Shivrang's penis.
- There it is.
- Cool.
Hey, Shivrang!
We're liars, man!
We are throwing you a good old-fashioned American bachelor party!
Whoops!
Bachelor party!
Yeah!
- Whoa!
Whoa - Hey!
What are you What is wrong with you?
!
Come on, come on Yeah I know.
Why don't we talk about some of the things that we love about Shivrang?
I'll start.
Um he has really good taste in magazines.
- This sucks!
- Boring!
- So lame.
- Jess, let's put in the slideshow that you made for Cece.
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
- Yes!
Time for porn cinema.
- No!
Oh, my God, no!
- Oh - Oh, my God.
No.
Guys, guys How are we gonna get a picture of Shivrang's junk?
Well, spoiler alert: - Women are liars.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
They're supposed to want commitment, right?
But then I offer it to them on a silver platter and they throw it back in my face like a comedy pie.
I know this is awkward because we slept together, and I never returned any of your phone calls, so this might come as a shock to you, but will you be my girlfriend?
Oh, God.
I thought you had herpes.
But no to the girlfriend, you dick.
Do you remember two years ago when we were watching coverage of the BP oil spill and doing it during the commercials and then you asked me if I wanted a serious relationship and I laughed in your face?
Well, my new answer is yes.
Be my girlfriend!
What's that all about?
Cream cheese in bulk?
I mean, it's possible that Cece's right.
I mean, maybe I'm just not a serious relationship kind of guy.
What are you talking about?
You dated Elizabeth for, like - for years.
- Yeah.
Elizabeth?
Yeah, but Elizabeth doesn't count.
She was during my "Big Guy" period.
So you like the foot rub?
Softer?
Harder?
That's perfect, Big Guy.
Look at all these little toes.
All my little toesies feel so good when you rub 'em, though.
This little this little one went to market.
If Elizabeth doesn't count, then why is it seared into my brain forever?
You were awfully salty about that.
She counts.
We need to make Cece jealous, and I don't think that's the route we want to take.
Then go to the wedding alone.
- Oh.
- Well, then, go with Elizabeth.
Great idea, Winston.
I'm gonna ask Elizabeth.
Yeah.
You were of no help to me, Nick.
That's what my whole thing about the whole thing with Elizabeth was that I was also suggesting - Thanks, guys.
- You're an idiot, dude.
You're the worst.
You guys were How did you know we were here?
Oh!
Oh, I just couldn't decide.
Your country's refusal to embrace Robbie Williams will forever baffle me.
Well, I got to say, we're really glad you're back at the table with us, Shivrang.
- Shivrung.
- Let's play a classic - bachelor party game right now.
- Mm-hmm, all right.
- I'm gonna take a photo of my junk.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.
'Cause this is what we do in America, Shivrang.
- What?
- Don't think that's much of a competition - Oh - I work here.
- It doesn't matter.
- They're not gonna fire me.
- Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
- Okay.
Yup.
- Just That is my junk in a photo.
Okay.
It's your turn, Shivrang.
Take a photo of your junk.
Oh, no.
No, thanks.
We're all doing it.
No, it's not Absolutely not.
- I'm begging you.
- But I will get us another round of drinks.
- Take the photo - Take the picture, Shivrang.
Who fancies a shandy?
What the hell is that?
It's a drink.
Two for you guys coming right up.
Cece actually designed that toilet.
Cece was a volunteer nurse, and, um No bottoms?
You know, what-what happens in Orlando stays in Orlando.
Nadia, seriously, turn it off.
Cece, is this how you like to spend time with your friends?
Is this the kind of wife you want to be?
No, no.
It's not at all, okay?
I didn't even know this party was happening.
It was a surprise.
I promise you, this is so not me.
I didn't want any of it.
Cece, you wanted a bachelorette party ever since I've known you.
Why do you have to pretend to be somebody you're not?
- What are you saying?
- I'm just saying, this is all moving really, really fast, and maybe you need to get to know Shivrang a little bit more, and maybe you need to slow this down so he can get to know you.
I'm getting married in three weeks.
Are you saying that I shouldn't get married in three weeks?
- No.
I'm just saying that maybe you should - I knew it!
I knew it!
You have been against this wedding from the beginning.
Fine!
I don't think you should marry Shivrang if it means you have to change who you are.
Yeah, well, I don't need to take relationship advice from a girl who's in the middle of a seventh grade debacle with a boy across the hall!
- Oh!
- "Oh, I'm a single adult, and I kissed another "single adult.
What's gonna happen?
"Does Nick like me?
"I better go pick out a party dress.
- I wear pajama sets"!
- You question my pajamas, you make me question our entire friendship.
- Let's say it, Jess!
- You never asked me to be your maid of honor.
It's awful hot in here.
Who wants to cool down with a double scoop of Alfredo?
- Not now, Alfredo!
- Seriously?
I'll take you to the candy shop I'll let you lick the lollipop Go ahead, girl, don't you stop Keep going till you hit the spot.
Congratulations, Cece.
Well, chaps, I guess we'll just have to make our own.
But first, I have to use the bathroom.
See you in a minute.
This is fun.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yeah.
- Fire!
- Oh!
- Real fire.
This fire is real.
- Fire!
Whoa!
What are you doing?
You were supposed to take the picture.
Aah!
It's burning so fast!
- Go put it out!
- You Oh!
Look, you guys are acting really, really peculiar.
What is going on?
What is going on is that, uh recently I've been one-half orphaned.
- I'm sorry.
- My-my dad passed away.
We orphans, man!
And it would mean the world to us not so much - if, uh - I miss Walt so much.
If we can get a photo of your penis.
Wait.
What?
I'm sor It would help with the grieving, it would just For Walt, man.
All right, all right, enough!
Okay.
We need a photo for for Cece.
- Cece?
- Yeah.
She's freaking out 'cause she's never seen you naked.
And she's afraid it looks all funky.
So just show us that it looks regular, and we all go home.
She's freaking out?
Look, guys, I've-I've got to go.
I have I have to talk to her.
Oh, you're We're all in the same car.
Ugh!
You know, I'm gonna take care of this.
How are you gonna take of this?
Crop, rotate, rotate and send.
- What are you doing?
- I mean, this.
- I just send a picture of your penis to Jess - No!
- and told her it was Shivrang's.
- No!
- So now, we good.
- You did not just do that.
Oh.
- Shivrang.
- What, Shivrang?
Shivrang, what?
- What?
- No, nothing.
It's nothing.
Don't.
- Oh, my God.
- "Shivrang's Shiv"?
You got your idiot roommates to kidnap - my fiancé to take a picture of his penis?
- Well, you were freaking out!
Well, see Three more weeks of winter.
Oh, my God.
- What are you doing?
- Get out!
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I immediately regret that.
- Show me!
- Okay.
You are scared because you haven't seen your future husband's manhood?
Where I come from, women cry about this for days.
This is real.
This is not a dream.
Look, I've kept off the weight.
You knew me when action sandals were my necessary footwear.
- What do you want?
- Why do you think I want something?
Because I dated you for four years.
I know when you want something.
What do you want?
I would like to take you to a wedding, because I miss you - so much - No, I can't take you seriously when you're wearing such tight pants.
Get to the point.
Okay, look, my model ex-girlfriend is getting married to some small little Indian man who I just don't understand.
Okay, and I want you to pretend to be my girlfriend so she gets very sad, and then, breaks off the wedding, and then, runs away with me.
- No.
Not a chance.
- No?
Wait, wait, wait, please.
Elizabeth?
I'm only gonna say this once.
You were the greatest boyfriend.
I loved Big Guy.
But then, you lost weight, and you got mean.
You stopped listening to me.
You changed completely.
You stopped paying for my dinner.
Elizabeth, to be fair, at that point, you were eating the lion's share of the food.
And you were sitting there eating one basil leaf, looking like an idiot panda bear.
- Well - Look, I loved Big Guy with all my heart.
But I have no interest in helping the guy who's standing in front of me now.
I hate your hair.
And I looked, and I looked, and I couldn't find it.
Where is it?
And then, I realized, uh-oh.
That is not his leg.
Oh, hey, uh, Jess, uh, please tell me Hey that nobody's looked at your photos in your phone.
Um you're too late.
Cece looked at it.
We all looked at it.
Prize hog, Shivrang.
- Yeah - I'm so sorry - they made you do it.
- Oh, it's okay.
Actually, it wasn't mine.
- What?
!
- What?
!
- Whose was it?
It was mine.
What?
!
No way!
- Yeah, it was, uh Those were my privates.
- Are you serious?
I'm serious.
Give me my phone.
I want it back now.
I have a Dead Dad Pass.
I have a Dead Dad Pass!
No!
No!
It's my property!
What is going on here?
And why is Alfredo crying in the elevator?
- Hello, you.
- What's up, Nadia?
It's just it's just that there's so much we don't know - about each other, and I - It's fine.
That's it.
I'm showing it to you.
I'm showing you my software.
No, no, no!
No, no!
- It's called hardware, Jack.
- Yeah.
If it run, I catch it.
I mean, I don't want to see it.
I do.
Okay.
But not-not not here.
I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, I-I Sometimes it feels like we're just moving so fast, and I feel crazy that we're just jumping in blindly.
But maybe that's what makes this special.
It's just a real leap of faith, Shivrang.
Yeah, uh, but look, the first thing that you need to know about me is that it's actually pronounced Shivrung.
- I don't know how to pronounce your name?
!
- No, no.
You were just so pretty, I didn't want to correct you.
But look, the most important thing is that I am gonna do my best to make you the happiest woman on the face of the earth.
Shavvy's getting nasty.
Shavvy a dog.
Shavvy?
We're friends now.
Dead Dad Pass.
Hey.
Look, Cece I just wanted to say that if I was ever selfish in our relationship What do you mean, "if," and what do you mean, "relationship"?
That's fair.
Um if I was I sincerely apologize.
So, challenge unaccepted.
I don't want a plus-one.
I'm really happy for you.
Thank you.
Good night, Schmidt.
Schmidty out.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I just want to say, um, I'm really sorry about No.
I'm-I'm I'm sorry.
And there's, uh There's something I've been wanting to ask you.
It's not traditional in Indian weddings to have a maid of honor, but I would really love it if you would be mine.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't know What?
!
Yes!
Oh, my God, thank you so much for asking me!
I paid.
All yours, no judgments.
Why'd you come back, Schmidt?
The Big Guy is Well, he's still somewhere inside this perfect body.
He needs you to coax him out a little bit.
Please tell him what to do next.
Eat the pizza.
Eat all the pizza while I watch right now.
Okay.
Oh.
It's so greasy.
So many carbs.
Hey guys Oh boy.
Welcome home, melted cheese.
Oh.
I don't even know what pepperoni's made of.
It's so good.
Is that your happy dance, big boy?
I love it.
- Oh, there he is.
- Yup.
There's my big guy.
It's like waking up from a bad salad dream.
Big guy in the house.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- What is that?
What are you doing?
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, hey, guys, you have any hair you want removed?
- Hey.
I must respectfully decline such a horribly depressing invitation.
Going on a date with Elizabeth tonight.
I haven't had sex with her since I was fat and accessing my penis was like getting the remote control out of the couch.
Now I know things, and I own things.
Like this.
- What is that?
- Oh, my God, that poor girl.
This is the Archduke.
The crowning achievement of the German Institute of Female Pleasure.
Dude, this thing takes I thought I threw that thing out the window.
That only made it stronger.
Daisy called, and we're going out tonight.
Yeah, she sounded pretty excited.
I do believe her exact words were, "This is your last chance".
- So, I'm very confident.
- Yeah.
Very confident.
Schmidt, can you help me with my phone?
I have Oh, you need help?
Where's your women's lib now?
From Teddy: "In town tonight.
Would love to see you.
9:00 p.m. drinks"?
- Oh, my God, Teddy.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, who's Teddy?
- Whoa, hey, man.
- What are you doing?
Nick?
- Weird and gross.
Sometimes I just sit in the stall and listen to you guys.
- Who's Teddy?
- Makes sense.
What do you think he wants?
You think I should meet him for a drink?
Am I the only one kind of dying to know who this Teddy character is?
- I think I speak for all of us - Nick, you and Jess didn't work out, okay?
- No Yeah, "ww" -- It's not about that, just - Chill out.
- Yeah, no.
Thanks.
Fine.
Look.
Um I already regret this.
Teddy Teddy took my flower.
- Wow, yeah, he did.
- What flower?
- What?

Yeah, he stole a flower from you?
And you want to have drinks with him?
- Oh, from your wonderful secret garden.

- You guys do have to hear this story, though.
- 'Cause it is the worst.
It's the worst!
- No, no.
- It's the worst.
- They I guarantee you it's not any more embarrassing - than the story of me losing my virginity.
- I promise you mine's worse than all of yours.
Prom night.

- What was the theme?
- Yeah, who cares about the theme?
- What were you wearing?
- I want to know the theme.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
It was after prom.
Cece and I were both 18, and we'd rented a hotel room.
So would you like to freak?
Yes, I would.
So And I thought what I felt was simple I'm gonna freak you toward the bed.
- Do I have your permission?
- Yes, you do.
And now that I am leaving Now I know that I So, he and I were the founding members of the Gender Equality Society.
Also, the only members of the Gender Equality Society.
We both asked each other to the prom in the spirit of gender equality, and we both said yes.

I'm gonna take off your dress.
Do I have your permission?
- Yup.
Yup.

I only hear what I want to - Um - I can't find the zipper.

Get to the sex part.

Yeah.
Oh, man.
He wore the hell out of those tuxedo pants.
People have told me I look really good in tuxedos, so - I don't think I've ever seen you in a tux.
- I've worn a tuxedo.
Everybody has tuxedos.
- Tuxedo is different than a suit.
- It is?
Wait, didn't he have a guitar?
Oh, my God, yes.
Best part.
And now that I am leaving I know that I did something wrong 'Cause I missed you Yeah, yeah 'Cause I missed you.
Lame.

Yeah, and, like, what is "prom" short for?
I think it's actually "promenade".

Uh, I have to deal with this So, you mean to tell me you didn't - lose your virginity at prom?
- Technically, no.
- Technically?
- Damn it, Jess.
Technically, why did we listen to that whole story, then?
- Technically, this guy's the worst.
- There was no sex.
Playing guitar for girls.
Girls don't like that.
That's a fact.
It's okay, man.
- What's okay?
- I wasn't done yet, guys.
I was in the prologue.
David Foster Wallace, where is the sex?
You're in last place.
Cece, please go.
Tell your story of how your lost your virginity.
I need a palate cleanse.
Actually, it was the same night.
It was prom night?
Really?
Who was it with?
Study Hall Steve or Cool Car Johnny?
Oh, yeah.
- Not exactly.
- Not them.
So what?
I'm a virgin.
I don't want to plan it out.
Whatever happens, happens.
Oh, hello.
I'd like to make love to you.
That's Mick Jagger.
- What?
!
- Whoa!
- What?
Game changer!
Freaking Beatlemania!
Beatlemania!
Keep it together, Schmidt.
- Oh, my - The Beatles?
!
He was just on tour in Portland, and we just started talking, and then we started laughing What but I'm confused.
Uh, Cece, that is not an embarrassing story.
Yeah, I know.
- But I just love telling it.
- Yeah.
Cece, you officially move into last place.
Boom.
Moving up, worst story.
Jess, you have no chance of winning.
It was my junior year of college.
I was about 200 pounds heavier.
Freshman 50 plus sophomore I got some lubricant.
It's to use on a woman.
Uh to increase her pleasure.
Hey is it chill if I have the room later?
Elizabeth and I have been talking, and - we plan on merging tonight.
- Yeah, Schmidt!
Penis, vagina.
Penis, vagina.
The room's all yours, cowboy.
Yeah, I got some, uh, mushrooms, and I'm going to a Dave Matthews concert later.
I'm a Daver.
That sucks!
White people.
Is this the first time you'll be making full love?
No way, Jose.
Look, Nick back in high school, they used to call me the Sex the Sex Hammer.
- That's a great nickname.
- But, you know, now that we're sitting here talking, would you mind having a discussion, uh, openly about the subject of intercourse?
- Shoot.
- Cool.
Hey, does it hurt for the guys?
Not one bit.
If I pee while it's happening, will she die?
How many minutes before sex is it is it okay to eat?
I don't think it's an exact science.
I think it depends on your frame.
So, I should eat right before.
In terms of lubricant, do I put a small amount everywhere or do I use a large amount in a small in a smaller area?
You're harshing my vibe, Schmidt.
You're the coolest, Nick.
You know, so I'd already taken the mushrooms.
- Obviously.
- And I was ready to go to the concert, when I realized that the troll at the end of my bed was pretty upset about it.
I don't want any trouble.
I think you're a remarkable creature.
No.
Oh I feel hot in my pants.
I still don't understand why you didn't just leave.
I've told you a million times, my arm was a magnet and the walls were magnetic.
What about that do you not understand?
I submit to your demands I will do anything Girl, you need only ask That's a real big jar of lube, man.
Wait, why are you rubbing it on your leg?
No, that's my arm.
Aah!
Eyes, eyes, eyes!
Oh, stop moving so much.
You're too slippery.
when you want me to And I will not let go Oh, this lube is so slippery.
Schmidt, where are you?
I can't see.
Sex.
I-I think there's enough lube.
I think we can do it now.
All right.
Get up.
You definitely shouldn't be going to get more.
I'm just gonna concentrate on you Girl, are you ready?
It's gonna be a long night Throw your clothes Throw your clothes On the floor On the floor I'm gonna take my clothes off, too - Schmidt?
- Be right there.
I think we overdid it.
I can't see!
I'm right here No!
Schmidt, I want to make love!
I got to go.
It's sex.
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
Look, when we were dating, I was very limited as to what we could do sexually.
It wasn't until the Iraqi war that I realized a guy could even be on top.
But that's all different now.
Now I have the Archduke.
Schmidt, have you ever considered not using lube and some giant sex toy, and just being with her?
Plain Jane-ing it?
Yeah, okay.
Well, I know for a fact that I can't win this thing, because my story was beautiful.
- Aw.
- No, your story was not beautiful.
Nick's dad took us on a business trip to New York, right?
And he said that we could do whatever we wanted.
And we did.
Oh, man.
They're all on the Titanic.
How does this movie end?
I can't believe I never seen it before, man.
It's the best.
You're mom's the best at having boobs.
- Shut up, stupid.
- I'm just kidding, man.
- Don't.
Don't.
- Hey.
I didn't bring you two dummies all the way to New York so you can park your cans on the couch, watch TV and flick each other's Bics.
Hey, Dad, last night, somebody broke in and ordered a pornographic movie, so there's a mistake on the bill.
Yeah, okay, you can tell that to the Marines.
Meanwhile I have a little surprise for you boys.
- Oh, cool.
- Ladies?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, what?
You lost your virginity to prostitutes?
No, they were businesswomen.
- Who could dance sexy.
- Winston, 100% they were prostitutes.
Dude, no.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
We work in the finance markets.
We work in the finance markets?
I'm Mysteria.
This is Octopussy.
Your name's Octopussy?
Absolutely.
Thank you, guys, for coming.
We're very wealthy.
Winston, listen to their names.
- They sound like pros.
- She was a nurse.
Dude, her nurse hat was in her purse.
Would you listen to yourself?
!
Uh-huh.
Honey, why are you sweating so much?
You should drink something.
Thank you for the offer, Ms. Octopussy, but I-I don't drink.
I prefer to be drunk on life.
Hold that for me?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
Perhaps I'll try some.
So she told me to come over and I took that trip And then she pulled out Very interesting.
- Uh, uh, uh.
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.
I'm gonna do it to you.
You're gonna do what to me?
I don't know.
Are you crying?
Please, excuse me, but I had to lay off a lot of really good men today at work.
- What's wrong with your friend?
- He's a virgin.
Aren't you a virgin, too?
Just my penis, baby.
Just my penis.
So Mysteria and I made love that night.
For ten beautiful seconds.
So, what do you do for a living?
And it was good.
Nick, I can't believe you lost your virginity to Octopussy.
I couldn't go through with it.
It's 'cause the boy had no game.
He couldn't close.
Okay, you don't need game.
They were prostitutes.
My dad told me.
Pop-Pop told you?
When?
Nicky, you here?
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.
What are you doing?
If I'm being totally honest, I've had some alcoholic beverages tonight.
Well, to be totally honest with you, so have I. How do you think I got through Annie?
Geez, that was rough.
- What happened here?
- I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't make love to Ms. Octopussy tonight.
It's too dangerous, and I was afraid the FBI was gonna track me down or a paper trail.
You think too much.
You think too much about everything.
When I was your age, my dad got a girl for me, too.
I mean, this is almost a Miller family tradition.
You should have seen her boobs.
They were great.
Real pointy, just like I like 'em.
Gross.
Listen, Nicky, you don't have to do anything that you don't want to do.
I just want to make sure that you don't miss out on the things in life that are happening when you're not thinking.
Because, believe you me, those are the best things in life.
I think I really like drinking.
Well, that's great.
That's wonderful.
That's good.
- That's a great start.
- It's really fun.
- It makes me feel good.
- Good.
Uh Don't tell Winston about the girls.
You know, that they're pros.
- Yeah, I won't.
- I don't want to break his heart, you know?
- Okay.
- I mean, you can tell him, but just wait, you know?
Maybe after I'm gone.
I'll tell him when you're dead.
So it's time you should know.
Mysteria On the bright side, looks like you won the contest.
- Actually - Jess, look at him.
- Let him have this.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Winston.
I just can't let you win this.
My story involves murder.
Was Mysteria even her real name?
No.
So I'd just moved to L.A. to be with Cece, and we went out to some bar.
- Do you remember where that was?
- No.
How did I get this far without having sex?
In three years, I'm gonna be 25.

Do you sell cookies?
Not a cookie bar.

The only antidepressants you need are in my pants.
Uh, it's really a medical issue.
I'm so sorry.
That was really uncool.

- Yeah, right.
Fat kid wants to dance at the cool college party.
- Nice joke, stranger.

It was very uncomfortable.
Stop threatening to move, Bernie, and just move!
I love that about you.
I'm gonna go to work.
Do you want to have lunch later?

It's slightly smaller.
Doctors-- no explanation.
That's not normal.
- Shut up, Bernie!
- Shut up, Bernie!
He can never find out about this, because he will kill you.

See ya, Schmidt.
Without validation, the parking rates are absurd.

You're angry.
Okay, that's lunch.
Be back in an hour.

Lettuce, tomato, lettuce, meat-meat-meat-meat-meat- meat-meat-meat-meat, - cheese, lettuce.

Is there anything you don't know everything about?
Try me.
All right, I will try you.
I've got a question about - Yolanda Winston.
- Sure.
Well, we've only slept together once, but, Bob, I don't know what she wants.
Well, the first thing you got to figure out is what do you want.
Well, I don't know how you get a podcast, but you should look into it.
Bob here.
Hey, Dad, new plan.
Headed over to Cece's.
- How's it going over there?
- Great.
We're making sandwiches, we're talking about girls.
Interesting.
Could you hand the phone to Nick?

Yeah, she wants to talk to you.
- Oh, cool.
Jess!
- What is going on over there, Nick?
!
- Hanging out with my boy Bobby D. - Bobby D!
I love that!

!
That's the one thing you should not be talking about!
- You are freaking out about noth - Hey, you know what?
I don't like what's happening here.
I am coming home.
Just relax.
I think he really likes me.
Oh, it's Cece.
I have to take this.
Cece, hi.
- What's going on?
- I fell asleep on my hand!
Oh!
It's not as bad as I thought.
I'm getting married tomorrow, and I look like Mike Tyson!
Okay, nothing a little cotton balls and olive oil can't fix.
In a few minutes, we are gonna laugh about this.
We will laugh.
Okay.
- This is funny later.
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, see?
It's coming right off.
Um All gone?
Burkas isn't you guys, is it?
This girl really means a lot to me, Bob.
- And I just don't want to screw it up.
- Why would you screw it up?
I don't want to make excuses, but my dad was kind of a a piece of You know, truth be told, Bob, I'm afraid I'm a lot like him.
The mere fact that you just said that means that you're nothing like your old man.
Any girl would be lucky - to have a guy like you.
- You mean that?
Yes, I do.
Think I'm gonna say something that might make you real happy.
That little girl I was talking about, Yolanda?
Her name isn't Yolanda.
It's Jess.
She's your daughter.
I'll kill you!
You're dead!
You're dead!
Hi, you-you tattooed my friend this morning for her wedding.
Is there a quick way of getting it off?
Uh-huh.
Okay!
Um, wonderful.
Thank you so much, Dipti.
That's awesome.
Thanks.
- It's not coming off.
- Nope, it's not.
Absolutely not.
Okay, look, um, Cece, I think maybe you should call Shivrang.
I don't want him to see me like this, Jess!
- Like, what have you done?
!
- What I've done?
You're the dummy who fell asleep on your hands!
I'm so sorry.
That shouldn't have come out of my mouth.
That was really uncool.
I've just had a crazy 24 hours, and I slept with Nick last night.
- You slept with Nick?
- I don't know.
I think it might be the start of something, like, really amazing.
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- I don't want to get my hopes up, but it could be something.
- Could not be something.
- Makes sense.
- I don't know.
- I have a full beard!
No.
Oh, no, no.
- I'm not scared of you, dude.
- What are you doing with that?
Put that down; I'm not gonna hurt you.
Okay.
Okay, conversation's over.
Nick, hands up, back away.
What is this?
- Dad, you're coming with me now.
- You want to get rid of me?
- So you two can do it again?
- What?
!
You told him?
!
God, I knew you would blurt it out.
Shows how much you know; I didn't blurt it out.
- I told him on purpose.
- Why would you do that?
!
- What is wrong with you?
!
- I wanted him to like me-- in fact, I want all fathers to like me.
I wonder what that's about.
W-What, do you owe money on the rent?
- I mean, what-what is going on here?
- Dad, I don't know what's going on.
We haven't had a chance to talk it out yet.
- Well, when did this happen?
- Last night.
- Nick!
- Why am I telling you this?
Jess, why are you picking him?
He's a lazy, drunken cable thief.
- Wh-What's wrong with Wilson?
- Dad, there's nothing wrong with Nick.
- You don't even know him.
- I do know him.
I know him.
When I was young, I was confused, I was lost, I had no plan.
But I went ahead and got married anyway.
And if I had figured things out before I got married, I might still be with your mother.
So I do know you.
You're not your father.
You're me.
And I'm not good enough for my little girl.
Yeah I got my own damn cake, and you can't have none!
- I got to No, I really - Nick, wait, Nick Damn it, Dad!
You know I'm right.
Oh, I have to go.
I have to go back to school now.
You sure you want to be eating so much cake with a body like that?
Guys?
Guys?
I've had a bad day!
Sit down!
All of you!
What is with everyone today?
Everything started so good.
Boy.
My roommate.
It was good, I'm not gonna lie.
It was very good.
But I can't date my dad.
Look life's messy.
It kicks you in the ass.
That's right, I said "ass".
But it does, it kicks you in the ass.
And, um the messy parts are the best parts.
Thank you, Miguel.
The gesture is very sweet.
- These are very bad for you.
- I've got a car.
I could take you to the movies.
No, you don't You do?
Jess called you?
Yeah, she said you needed me.
She also told me to watch out for the girl who looked like Mandy Patinkin We can't get married like this.
Hey, look, if this is our biggest problem, I'll take it.
I'll make a call and fix it.
Now that your mom's dead, do you do all the landlording yourself?
Uh-huh.
You want to dance?
I'm wearing the shirt that you got me.
Did you think I threw it away?
Frogetaboutit.
- Go home, Schmidt.
- I don't want to go home, Elizabeth.
Look, I want to be with you.
Anl-I don't care who knows it.
Hey, Geppetto.
Make with the "oom pah pah".
We have a pump that can blow that thing up in, like, two seconds.
I prefer to do this the old-fashioned way.
I know that's not the way things are done around here.
So long as I'm in town, I am going to sleep between you and him.
Dad, you don't have to worry about me.
I know you think this is gonna be a mess, but it's my mess.
Jess, I'm your father I'll always worry about you.
_ What do you say Is this the time For one more try At a happy life This was the breakfast I was gonna give you this morning.
Is this unwise To think my fears Hey, um I hope my dad didn't get in your head.
No.
Uh, no, uh Oh, look who took the romance spot.
We were just gonna match up constellations with the mole patterns on my back.
Then we're gonna get drunk and try to find people doing it.

{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hey, guys!
Hurry up!
I'm the maid of honor and I have to be there early and I wanna get a picture in before we go.
Miami Vice called and I'm not sure I don't know how to finish that joke.
- What?
- Ah, it's crap joke, it's crap joke.
Winston, please.
Your belly is on my hip.

No - uh, Rick, move one step to your right.
- Me?
Yes, one step to your right.
One more step to your right.
- I can't go much further.
- One more step to your right.
Until you get into the hallway, - and then, once you get in the hallway - No, I see what you're doing, dude.
- Dad, - Very funny, buddy.
- Dad, Dad, we have to go - go directly to the Chinatown trash can - where you got that suit.
- There's nothing wrong with this suit.
- Dad, we need to take the picture.
I wore this at my high school graduation.
- Nick, you're not doing yourself any favors.
- I look very handsome.
I look like I'm on Miami Vice.
- Should I take the picture?
- No, I'm not doing this.
- He's getting on me about the suit.
- You're ruining the picture.
- Okay.
- I'm not doing it.
I'm out of here.
- Stop.
Where are you going?
- Was gonna do my cool poses.
You ready?
One, two Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
- You changed.
- Check it out.
Schmidt gave me his worst suit.
He said, if I could get it over my thighs, he didn't want it.
Miami Vice called, and this time, I answered.
- Yeah?
- Yeah!
I hope you're not doing all this 'cause of what my dad said.
I don't think you're an unemployable alcoholic bummer.
- What?
- No, I don't think you're a child.
- Whoa, when did he say that?
- Hmm?
- What?
- Bob said that about me?
Anyway, the point is I don't think you're any of those things.
We're at a wedding together.
It's nice, right?
You look great.
Thanks.
So do you.
- I'm gonna go find Cece.
- Yeah.
All right, I guess we're doing that.
There are so many fun, cool traditions at this thing.
The groom comes in on a white horse.
So, basically, they're just copying my Bar Mitzvah.
Oh, my goodness.
That is Bucky the Badger, Wisconsin's mascot.
Yeah, I got a sweatshirt with his face on it, and he's wearing a sweatshirt with his face on it.
Bucky cool.
Bucky!
He's got a super weird thing with badgers.
Is that a real badger?
Hey, the ceremony lasts for three hours, so you better go pee now.
You know, your weak bladder.
- You remembered.
- Of course I did.
Now I have to pee.
Every time you say "pee," I have to pee.
Thank you for coming.
- Go pee.
Okay.
- I'm gonna.
It's okay to be nervous.
But nothing can go wrong.
All you have to do is go out there, get married, and I will do the rest, okay?
Schmidt!
Get out.
Well, this certainly isn't the bathroom.
Get out.
Get out.
Guys, guys, shut up and listen to me-- it's Cece.
- She doesn't want to get married.
- Damn.
- What happened?
Well, her exact words were: "I don't want to marry Shivrang, "but my whole family has flown out here from all the way across the world.
I can't back out now.
Please, Schmidt, as my closest friend, help me".
- What did Jess say?
- Well, Jess didn't hear it-- Cece told me with her eyes.
- Oh, so nothing happened.
- Cool, so she's marrying Shivrang.
- No, guys, I know Cece-- - I know her looks.
- Schmidt, what were you doing back there?
Cece's backing out of the wedding.
- What?
- It's true.
She told me.
- With her eyes.
- Oh, my God.
I thought you were talking about something real.
Schmidt.
The wedding's happening-- let her go.
I have let her go.
I'm with Elizabeth now and she's amazing.
Look, Jess, I'm telling you this as Cece's friend and nothing more.
Cece loves Shivrang-- I know that 'cause I know her better than you do.
False.
When you've had sexual congress with someone and you've peered into their soul at the exact moment of fulfillment - Ew.
- No, no, hear him out.
Schmidt, listen up and listen good.
You are not to talk to Cece, you are not to look at Cece, and you are not to have eye conversations with her.
Or I will bust you.
Hard.
- And later, I'm gonna bust you hard.
- Yeah, you are.
Good night, nurse.
I've been naughty.
Sorry, I didn't know-- you guys were supposed not supposed to hear that, so Bros ever before the ho.
- Anybody have a jar?
- I'm sorry, okay?
But we have to sabotage this wedding.
- Winston?
- No, guys, look, you always bring me into these situations, and I get in over my head because I love pranks.
I really do.
I mean, you know that.
- Yeah.
- But look, it's time for me to just face the facts that I'm no good at them.
You know, I'm 31 now, and it's time for me to cut the nonsense.
You're 100% right, man, but just, I don't know what about today, just today you give me full-on crazy?
- Yeah!
- You listen here!
- Hey, hey, hey.
Nobody's doing anything!
- Yeah!
- What?
- What?
- Jess asked us not to, so we are going to enjoy Cece's wedding like adults.
So good night, nurse.
Sorry for saying that.
I am all I'm all turned around.
We sabotaging this thing or what?
Absolutely.
Hello, Auntie.
This is embarrassing.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me, Elizabeth.
Can I talk business?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- I want you to call it off.
- What?
Whatever you're planning on doing, don't do it.
- This wedding means a lot to Jess.
- What are you doing?
What has happened to you?
- You changed your suit, you're carrying her purse.
- Yeah, I am.
You're wearing deodorant - under both arms - Both arms, yeah.
Why are you trying so hard, man?
Either Jess wants the real you or or she don't.
The real Nick would help me sabo this wedding.
Is "sabo" short for sabotage, Schmidt?
Why would you?
- I mean, why would you even say that?
- I knew it was.
I was being mean.
- I was bullying you to get dominance in this moment.
- You know it of course you know you know it is.
- I want you to call it off.
- You know it's - You know "sabo" is short for sabot sabotage.
- I know I know Hey, skin it and call it off.
- You got it, man.
- Thanks, man.
- I'll call it off.
No problem, Nicholas.
- Thank you, buddy.
I appreciate that.
- Thank you.
- Now.
Now?
Shivrang, hold on!
Ow, my testicles!
Don't get on the highway!
Just reared up and just took off - I'm scared that it might have damaged me.
- No, no, no, no damage.
Are you enjoying the wedding festivities, Schmidt?
What a spunky horse.
I know you're responsible for the horse thing.
- Was I?
- Yes.
- Was I?
- Yes.
- Was?
- Yes.
- Was?
- Yes.
- Was I?
- Yes.
Was I?
Schmidt.
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe I'd been married a long time ago Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eyed Joe It's okay.
Who are you working with?
Where did you come from?
Where did you go?
Where did you come from Cotton-Eyed Joe.
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Winston, no!
Don't do this.
What's done is done, Nicholas.
Turn it off!
I couldn't stop it even if I wanted to.
Turn it off!
- Nick!
- Pranks!
- Wrong way!
- What What did you Of course!
Of course you were scheming with Schmidt.
Jess, I didn't do anything.
You think that Schmidt and Winston would be smart enough to duct-tape the sound board?
That's brilliant!
Plus, we both know that this is your CD.
Where did you come from, where did you go?
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eyed Joe?
Why did you need me for this?
Nick?
Winston must have taken that out of my car.
How gullible do you think I am?
You're fist-pumping right now.
- No, I'm not fist-pumping.
- Yes, you are.
Aah!
- It's so freaking catchy.
- I thought I could count on you.
- I thought things would be different now.
- How could you think I would do this - at your best friend's wedding?
- Because it's exactly the type of thing that you do.
- A stupid, childish prank.
- Oh, childish?
You're right.
I'm a child.
- Great sabo, man!
- I'm so good at pranks, man.
- I feel alive.
- Really good Phase three.
What's phase three?
Whatever it is, I'm in.
Let's do this.
- Uh, hey, Jess?
- Hmm?
- We went too far.
- What?
- It's bad.
- How bad?
It's really bad.
Schmidt - What did you do?
- It was Winston's idea.
Oh, my God.
I'm really sorry, okay?
I didn't want anybody to get hurt, but it's too late now.
- It's bigger than all of us.
- Tell me everything.
Or, so help me God, I will mess up your hair.
Your precious hair.
- Winston's in the - What?
- Winston's in - What?
Say it louder.
Say it louder.
Winston is in the air ducts with a badger.
- What?
!
- Nick's there, too.
Ah, Nick.
You've never gone along with one of my pranks before.
This is exciting.
I never noticed, but you kind of have a girl butt.
Is that weird to say?
This priest is never gonna know what hit him.
Wait, that is the plan?
You're gonna drop a badger on a priest?
Oh!
He's mad.
That can't be the plan, man!
- What did you do?
What did you do?
What did you do?
- I deserve this.
I deserve this.
I deserve this, okay?
It's just, when Nick got involved, it became too big.
What?
What do you mean, "when Nick got involved"?
- He wasn't always involved?
- No.
He said no.
He said, "Jess means too much to me," or some crapola like that.
- What are you doing?
- Calling Nick.
Jess, he's in the ducts!
The ducts!
- Beautiful ceremony.
- Happy day.
- The ducts!
- I know where he is, Schmidt.
- What?
No, no.
- That's my phone.
- I said no phones.
- I know.
I'm gonna get it.
They can track us with phones.
What is going?
Relax.
You're so weird with pranks.
- What is going on with you?
- Put the phone away!
I'm trying to!
I'm trying to turn it off, you idiot!
Oh no.
- What's going on?
- Uh Bucky got out of his cage, man.
- No!
No!
I'm getting out of here!
- Let's go get him.
No, you're coming with me.
You got to help me find the badger, Nick!
- You don't be no bitch!
- I want out of this place!
Bucky!
God bless both of you.
May he shower you with many, many children.
Ugh, he's not picking up.
- Of course he's not picking up.
He's in the - Don't say it.
ducts.
He's in the ducts.
Nick, stop being a bitch!
Don't be no bitch!
Bucky!
- I'm going up there.
- Okay, good.
'Cause I really don't want to go up there.
Look, I'm the kind of guy that likes to enjoy the AC, not see how the sausage is made.
Seriously, Schmidt?
Shut up and give me a boost.
Bucky Aah.
- Winston!
- Nick, where are you?
- Marco - Polo!
I don't want to play that.
- No!
Nick, it's me!
Nick, it's me!
Jess, what are you doing here?
Look, I-I know you didn't plan the sabotage, and I know you're doing this just to get back at me, but please don't do this.
Jess, it's not about the sabotage, okay?
It's about the fact that you think I'm gonna screw up everything I touch.
- No, Nick, I don't.
- You know what, Jess?
This is where I belong.
With Winston and a badger.
All right, Nick, look, let's just go get the badger and get out of here.
Can't get the badger because it's loose.
What?
!
Hey, Jess, welcome, welcome.
No!
Jess!
You know, I'm just staying positive, but, uh - I'm pretty sure this is where we die.
- Winston!
When you complete the seven circles, you will be officially married.
You don't have to walk so fast, you know.
Guys?
Guys, you know I've been thinking a lot about the Earth.
We got to leave it better than when we found it.
Is this what you wanted your life to be?
Is this how you wanted to enjoy your best friend's wedding?
Nick, look, no.
Stop that.
- I am not a healthy person.
- Yeah, I know.
I know, Nick.
Oh, you do?
- So a part of you agrees with your dad.
- No.
- Just oh, my - Okay.
We got to get out of here.
lovely ceremony with all your family and friends.
Tell me that there isn't a small part of you that's scared that I'm too much of a mess.
- We have to go.
- That this thing is a mistake.
You and me.
Just admit it, Jess.
Yes, there is a small part.
Yeah.
But Run!
Oh, my - It's okay.
- Jess?
Always a bridesmaid Aah!
Something touched my leg!
You know, sometimes I feel like I never really felt love, you know?
Do you know?
Hey!
Hey, hey, everybody.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Jessica Day.
I'm the, uh, maid of honor.
I'm also the person who fell through the roof with my friend Nick Miller here.
Um, I have a few things to say.
Um, there might be a badger on the loose, but I have my best people on it.
I'm on it.
Don't scare the badger!
- Schmidty, help me!
- Okay!
- Funnel it into the mandap!
- Okay.
Hey, guys.
He's in the ninth row.
He is headed north.
Where were we?
Um, Your Honor, please tell us where we were.
We were on the seventh circle.
So close.
Great.
Cece, go.
- Jess, you don't have to fix this.
- Fix what?
This is a perfect day.
I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.
And it's not because of the horse.
Or the badger.
Or "Cotton-Eyed Joe".
This isn't what I want.
What I want is to be with someone else.
Shivrang, I feel terrible.
I'm sorry.
No No, Cece, it is okay.
In fact, it's more than okay.
I don't know why I didn't tell you the truth ages ago, but but I want to be with someone else, too.
- Really?
- Yes.
I have tried to forget you, Elaine-- really, I have-- - but I just can't.
- Who the hell is Elaine?
And I don't care what my family says.
I want to marry you in a Presbyterian church.
Oh, Shivvy.
I've loved you since the first grade.
And I'm so lonely without you.
I just lay awake at night, and I just write about you in my journal, and I paint pictures of you on my easel.
I want our children to be photographers and and backpack across Europe.
Will you take me away from this madness?
And you are not too short for me.
I don't care what your mother says.
Oh, Elaine!
Come!
Let's go to Vegas and elope!
I feel slightly rejected.
Well - you were slightly rejected.
- Yeah.
You okay?
Well, I'm not as good as Elaine.
Who could be?
I feel better than I've felt in a long time.
Good.
I'm glad.
Boobies.
I don't think the badger's actually rabid.
I think, um he's just kind of a dick.
So Hey, Nick.
- You okay?
- Me?
Yeah.
You mean from the fall?
Yeah.
And - what we talked about.
- Yeah.
Look, Jess, it's not you know, that big of a deal.
And we tried.
It's just You might be right about your fears, you know, it's Just just say it.
I-I think we should call it, you know?
It's not like we're in love or anything.
We had one night.
Okay, let's call it.
I think that feels good to me.
Does that feel good to you?
But you must have feelings for her.
You tried to sabotage her wedding.
I sabotaged her wedding as a friend.
I didn't want her to marry someone else as a friend.
It's only mantic because it's a wedding.
I would be just as happy to sabotage, I don't know - let's say, her tax audit.
- Schmidt.
Weird day, huh?
It's a beautiful wedding, Cece.
- Thank you.
- It was Schmidt that you were talking about, right?
It was.
I'm-I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
Don't be sorry.
It's not your problem.
It's Schmidt's.
- Why is it Why is it my problem?
- Who's it gonna be?
Me or her?
No, she's right.
- You have to choose.
- We're gonna do this now?
But can can we sleep on it, maybe?
Maybe take the night?
I've got I just got this brand-new Coldplay bootleg.
Live from Rotterdam.
What if we just make some pasta and really listen to it?
Are you in love with her or are you in love with me?
You have to decide.
Can I get a beer?
- Heisler?
- Perfect.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
Bucky bit me.
- Bit me bad.
- Hmm.
Yeah.
So, um so I'm pretty dizzy.
Okay.
Okay, what happened with Jess?
We called it.
And she left.
Yeah, we-we called it off.
So, now I'm gonna drink, because that's my move.
Yeah.
That was also your dad's move.
Yeah, when things get messy, you just run away.
But, you know, there are other moves.
Go.
Thanks, man.
Hey, bartender, can you call an ambulance?
I'm about to bleed out.
Thanks, man.
Look, I know you think we should call it, but I don't want to give up on this, even if we don't know what this is.
I want to un-call it.
Please, can we un-call it?
Before you say no Don't say no.
Down, down in my bones Hey, give me the keys.
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.
Where did we come from?
Where do we go?
- Where did we come from?
- Shut up.
Yeah, that was "Cotton-Eyed Joe," wasn't it?
You talk to me I felt like something was gonna happen.
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
So let's go to bed Before you say something real Turn left.
- No, I'm going to make three rights.
- No, Nick, just turn left!
No, it's slower my way.
Why would you want to go slower?
'Cause it's you Oh, it's always you
