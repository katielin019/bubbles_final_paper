{START OF EPISODE 1}
1  Moira: David, this isn't funny!
I have my first Town Hall meeting in an hour, where is my portfolio?
!
Uh, why why would I know where your portfolio is?
You were bedazzling it last night.
Excuse me?
I haven't bedazzled anything since I was 22.
David, you were dressed like a harlequin, and you were gluing shiny jewels perhaps that was just a night terror.
Um oh God.
Okay.
Oh.
Well!
Uh  Hello.
Hi, uh, I'm-I'm Jake.
- Oh, of course you are.
-  - David?
- Um, Jake, this is my mother.
Listen, I'm really sorry, I didn't think anybody would be home.
Okay, nobody was supposed to be home.
Nobody was supposed to be home, so You were supposed to be at lunch, why-why are-why were you not at lunch?
!
David, stop acting like a disgruntled pelican!
I came home from lunch because I realized - I misplaced my portfolio.
- folio.
So we're-I'm gonna we're gonna look for it.
- Johnny: David, - Oh my God!
we're looking for your mother's portfol Oh.
Oh!
Okay.
Hello, uh, Johnny Rose.
You are?
- Jake.
- Yes, welcome, welcome, Jake.
I see uh, David's made you feel right at home.
- Okay, Dad!
- John No, no, no, I'm just saying, carry on doing whatever you're doing, or not doing.
- Okay.
- I mean, I see things - No.
Got it, got it - are wrapping up here, so - so much.
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!
- Alexis, this is Jake.
We seem to have caught the boys in a In an "afternoon delight".
- Is that term still a going thing?
- No, that's no.
- No, never say that again.
- Don't do that.
Um David, I thought we agreed, only when nobody was home.
Nobody was home!
- Nobody was home!
- Oh, here it is!
Ha ha ha!
Nice to meet you, Jacob.
If you take half as much care of our son - as you do your physique, - Okay!
David should be in very good hands.
Yes, well, not-not your hands, - Mhmm, yep.
Bye!
- but uh generally speaking Well, I hope it was worth it.
Okay, I think you can take a step outside.
You can step outside while this is happening.
Let him change.
You're like a predator!
Um Cal: Okay, and so the last four digits on that credit card number are 6-3-1-2?
Great, and the security code on the back?
Bob, who's sitting at my desk?
Your next big opportunity, that's who.
What opportunity?
Well, Cal's doing big business, and since you two are sharing an office, uh, I thought you might wanna get in on some of it.
Sharing an office?
You've rented out my office space?
!
Well, Johnny, you weren't exactly paying rent, and Cal's business is booming.
Cal: I should add that registration is totally free, there's no charge whatsoever for registration, there's just a small monetary And what business is this?
Antivirus.
The guy's amazing.
Cal: Okay, you'll be receiving your CD-ROM in the mail within the next two weeks, and you'll know the software is working if you don't see any changes.
Bob, this sounds like a scam.
Far from it.
No, my-my computer was riddled with viruses.
I mean, Cal uh, he fixed it, over the phone!
He didn't even look at my computer!
That's how good he is.
Bob, I've got a meeting with a client in an hour, and I cannot be conducting business with somebody yammering into the phone beside me!
Johnny, you're putting me in a bit of a pickle here.
You know, obviously I'd like to keep you both.
But there's uh a cardboard box over there, you know, if you do feel like you wanna you know, pack up your things.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.
Um, what are you what are you doing here?
I just popped in to say hello.
Yeah, he came to say hi to me.
Oh yeah.
Um, and-and what and um how long have you been here for?
Why, are you writing a true crime novel?
I'm just curious.
Just curious about what you guys are what you guys are talking about.
About stuff.
Mhmm Is that okay with you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I should probably head.
I've got a ton of work to do, so  - Mmmm!
- Bye.
Bye.
Unnnh!
Ahh - I'll be in touch, all right?
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay.
- Okay.
What the flying  is going on here?
!
I was gonna ask you the same thing!
- What was that?
!
- Uh, what was that?
!
We're seeing each other!
Okay, we're seeing each other.
He literally came here from my room.
Well, he dropped me off at work this morning.
He what?
!
He dropped me off - at work this morning!
- Okay, I get it!
Um, he did not mention that to me.
And frankly, I don't know whether I want your sloppy seconds!
Uh, first of all, who says they're sloppy, and second, who's to say we're not getting his sloppy thirds?
!
Who knows how many people he's got on the go at this point?
Okay, well all I know is that someone is sloppy and it's not me!
Moira: Well, hello, everyone!
What time is curtain?
We'll probably start in a few minutes.
Well, it looks like a full house out there.
Huh!
So uh is this what everyone's wearing?
Well, I might lose the jacket.
If we look to have given up on ourselves, how can we assure our constituents that we haven't given up on them as well?
So we look like we've given up on ourselves?
Could we remember please that these are real people, with real problems, people!
And while I can't pretend to fully understand them, I can at least attempt to care!
Places, please!
Um, okay, so I downloaded this app, basically so clients can schedule their appointments online.
It just saves me answering the phone.
Right, so then what will you do?
Thank you for asking, Ted.
And here is my answer.
Um, my answer starts by me saying So, you two call each other?
Hey!
Um, about what?
You're dressed the same.
Ah, never heard that one before.
- How are you?
- I'm good, good.
Tennessee and I are actually goin' on a trip for a while, so Wow, like, Tulum?
Or Uh, just gonna get in our car, and drive up the coast, let the road take us where it wants.
No plans, no phones, no schedules.
Basically my worst nightmare.
Sounds very adventurous.
Yeah, well, I just needed to get away for a while, you know?
So uh, what's new with you guys?
Well, Alexis came home to a naked man in her bathroom.
- Cool.
- Um no, it wasn't cool, because he wasn't actually there for me, which made everything very awkward, and uncomfortable for everyone.
Well, you're free to use the barn while I'm away.
You know, if you need some privacy.
I was actually looking for someone to water the plants, and check over the place, so Oh, well, thank you, Mutt.
That actually might be good for me.
Well, we're leaving this afternoon, so you know, just swing by and grab the keys.
That's very generous.
Is that weird?
Daycare Worker: Parents are complaining that they're struggling to get off work early enough to pick up their kids, and so that's why we would like to extend the after school daycare program by half an hour.
That's an idea we'll give some real thought to.
Spoken like a true politician.
Ah!
Vivacity aside, our children's safety is no laughing matter.
As a mother who once invested a great deal of time and money into her children, I, for one, stand by the request to extend the hours of the daycare.
One might think that an additional 30 minutes will have no impact, but you tell that to the mother whose manicurist just applied the wrong color, and must start all over again, or the father who got stuck in a mine!
That extra half hour could be the difference between a child who gets picked up safely, and one who wanders the street, waiting for a dust-covered man to emerge from the darkness!
We do wait with the kids Is that really what we want for our town?
Homeless toddlers?
!
Tugging at your pant legs?
!
Okay Moira, I think you've made your point.
I assure you, council will examine this issue thoroughly and carefully.
Your children will be safe, that is a promise!
Moira, what are you doing?
You undermined my authority!
We were losing our audience!
You saw the walkouts.
And on opening night!
- This isn't a theatre!
- Isn't it?
Look, you can't go making blind promises to these people!
This isn't "Sunrise Bay," where everybody lives in a perfect dream world!
I'll have you know, Sunrise Bay was a coastal community plagued by a centuries-old curse!
I hate to jump in here, but you told me I should use the bathroom during the break, and uh, the line's getting really long!
- Go for it, Bob.
- Ohhh!
Ronnie, you have whispers of a maternal instinct.
Isn't this issue important to you?
It's not a matter of importance, it's a matter of money!
Then find the money!
Ohhh, okay, why don't I just tiptoe into my orchard of money trees, and fill my basket with money for you!
And while we're at it, why don't I gather up some diamond carrots, and some golden potatoes!
And I don't mean the kind of potatoes you eat, I mean, the potatoes that are made out of actual gold.
Okay, there must be some solution.
To the problem you just caused?
I'm sure you'll figure somethin' out.
Oh, welcome to the show.
Johnny: Well, first, I wanna say thank you, Amy, for taking the time to see me today.
It's actually Amygrace.
Amygrace, well, apologies.
It's funny, 'cause I remember when our families used to vacation together, you were just "Little Amy".
I've always been Amygrace.
Ah well then, just call me Johnnymichael.
You know, I-I'm very interested in your business, Amy grace.
It's been very fulfilling.
Yeah.
"Screamnastics".
"Screamnastics," I read that's a combination of gymnastics and um screaming?
Scream therapy, yes.
And extreme juicing.
Ah well, I'm a big juice fan myself.
Just so you know, Mr. Rose, most orange juices have frighteningly high sugar levels.
Okay So, here's the important thing.
I believe this town could be the perfect spot for your next franchise.
Here's the issue, Mr. Rose, I've been touring small towns, in an extensive market research trip.
And unfortunately, what we're discovering is that most "rural" communities just don't have the same interest in health.
Or wellness.
Or what we like to call, "Screamnastic inner/outer beauty connectivity".
Well, I know a lot of people here who are very connected to their inner and outer beauty.
And even more who could use some of that "Screamnastic" connect tivity.
I love your enthusiasm, Mr. Rose.
It's very "Screamnastic".
Well, this town is very "Screamnastic," Amygrace.
Why don't we circle back in I don't know, six months, and see how things are going then?
Yes, sure, sure, sure.
We can do that.
Tell you what, why not make it three months?
Let's circle back in three months, and that way we might be able to open a "Screamnasium" by Christmas.
Oh, we don't call them that.
But it's been so great seeing you, Mr. Rose.
And my parents say hi, by the way.
They were beside themselves when they found out what happened to you guys.
Well, we're okay.
We're doing just fine, thank you.
Anyway, you take care.
You too.
Ahem!
That's a nice chair.
Oh, hey.
Thanks!
I'm just putting the last coat on it now.
- Ah.
- I think I'm getting a little high - from the fumes.
- Oh, that's nice.
Uh, we know that you're seeing both of us.
- So - Okay.
Wait, did you not know that?
Uh, no, we did not.
I mean, when you kissed us both on the mouth we sort of pieced it together.
Listen, I don't want to cause any drama.
- We don't want any drama!
- Who wants drama?
Nobody does.
Some clarity would've been nice.
- You know?
- Totally, yeah.
I just uh I assumed you guys were cool with it.
Yeah, I don't think it's a matter of not being cool with it, I don't think that's that's not what this is, it's um, what this is, is a clarity thing.
Yeah.
So you are cool with it?
Yeah, I'm cool with it now.
I'm not not cool with it.
I don't think that was ever the thing, so I don't think anybody's not cool here.
Okay, cool.
Well, hello again, you beautiful people.
I would love to circle back to this matter of the extended daycare hours.
Although I made some excellent points, in the interest of a fair and balanced discussion, I will now argue the other side of the issue.
One of my fondest memories from childhood were weekdays, between 5:30 and 6 P.M.
That was our time!
And we would've fought anyone who dared try to take it away from us.
So you're not extending the hours?
Do we really want Big Brother programming every waking minute of our children's lives?
!
So is that a yes or a no, I - It's an absolutely.
- Absolutely what?
Absolutely crucial absolutely crucial!
Crucial that we approach-that that we entertain every - approach.
I don't - Ahem!
We'll think about it.
Alexis!
What's what's up?
Hey, it's you.
Um, we just came by to pick up the keys for the barn.
The keys to this barn?
Yeah, Mutt asked me to just pop by, and keep an eye on the place while you are gone.
Okay.
This is just the first I'm hearing about it, which is fine.
If I had known you were staying at our place, I would've cleaned the sheets for you guys.
Oh no, we're not together.
You literally could not have said that any faster.
Hey babe, I'm just getting caught up here.
So, Alexis is crashing at our place?
Not crashing.
It just caught me off guard, 'cause I didn't know that there was an arrangement here.
I don't know about arrangement, it just sorta happened.
You're the one who said you don't like to plan things.
Well, I like to plan things sometimes.
Uh, so Tennessee, Mutt tells us that you guys are heading up the coast?
- Yes!
- Yeah, we're meeting some friends.
We're going on a pinecone harvest.
Pinecone harvest?
We're picking pinecones.
I got this old compass at a flea market; we're just gonna drive until we see the pine trees.
Hmm, that sounds like it is gonna be super fun and intense.
Mutt, you didn't tell me about Yeah, the pinecones.
So, we know roughly where we're going.
I'm pretty sure the compass is broken, though.
Well, I think that it's better to just freefall into it.
- Yes.
- Yeah, but like I said, it wouldn't hurt to bring a map.
Anyway, you pick the pinecones, and they harvest the seeds.
It sounds like this is going to be like, a very um, cathartic journey for you guys.
- Here's hoping.
- Hmm!
Yeah.
So uh, here's the keys.
And take care of the place.
Don't throw any parties.
Pinky swear.
Hmm, we should probably get going.
We were going to hit the hot springs before the sun sets!
Oh yeah, definitely want to get a soak in, before you tackle the cones.
Which you must really be "pining" for by now!
Okay.
Okay!
- Well, safe travels.
-  Yeah, that was weird.
I will not be watering those plants.
Jocelyn: Hello?
Sorry.
- Hey, Moira.
- Hi.
- Hey!
- Hey, Moira.
Stay away from the Cafe, the olives are bad.
I found Johnny at the Cafe, he'd had a lot of olives, so I thought I would take him home before he had any more "olives".
- Hello, dear.
- John, what have you Oh, John, you smell like my mother!
Well, Bob kicked me out of the garage so Cal could steal people's money.
I think you can handle this from here, so have a good night, Johnny.
Okay, thanks, guys.
Oh John, I think you could use a nice, cold shower.
Well, I need something.
You and the kids are doing it all, Moira.
Alexis has a job, David's puttin' money in the coffers, you're on Council, making a difference every day.
Not every day.
You know what, I don't know if I'm looking after this family as well as I should be.
John, you're the only one holding this family together.
And that's the most important job of all.
You're a good man, John Rose, and good men always win!
Not at this exact moment perhaps, you have an olive stain on your tie.
What's that?
But just because no one is currently seeing all the wonders of which you are capable, does not mean that you are not one of the most talented people in this family.
Well, thank you, Moira.
David: Has he thrown up yet?
- Oh, go to bed!
- Alexis: It's six o'clock!
- Goodnight!
So, on a scale of one to a Sao Paolo hangover, how are we feeling right now?
I wouldn't have gotten out of bed this morning.
Children, have some respect for your father's condition.
I'm feeling fine, Moira.
- You don't look fine.
- I'm fine!
Okay All right, ready to order?
Yeah, toast dry toast, and more coffee, please.
And I know it's early, but I'm kind of feeling like, a big piece of fish.
Mm!
Um and I'll have a bowl of room temperature hollandaise sauce, please.
Oh, that's funny, very funny.
- Don't listen to them, John.
- Very funny.
Don't listen and pick a point on the wall if you need to.
Just a fruit cup for me, please.
Anything else?
Um yeah, I would love to order something else, but I'm just having trouble seeing the menu.
Yeah, so um if we could somehow make it brighter in here?
Okay, you know what, kids?
Stop it.
Okay, well, I will be right back with the toast, fruit, fish, and sauce.
- Thanks.
- Perfect.
Have you no empathy?
!
Stop persecuting your father, we all know he's in a bad way.
No bad way, Moira, I'm actually feeling pretty good.
Well I, for one think we should celebrate your resilience!
A toast!
- A toast!
-  All right, you know what, I'm sitting at another table.
Alexis seems to think you like me more.
Alexis, don't be ridiculous.
It's exactly the kind of paranoia that makes me wary of spending time with you.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 - David: Oh my God!
- Alexis: Ugh!
Jeez, I'm not out the door yet!
Hey, hey, David, isn't that your friend?
Moira: Oh, I didn't recognize him clothed.
Yeah, I don't know what he's doing here.
You sure, David, 'cause I've got a pretty good idea.
Alexis, don't be crass.
David, is he here to s Oh my God, I literally told him to never come back here while you people were home.
So, I don't Um What are you doing here?
Well, I was just in the neighborhood.
so I just thought after last week, we decided to avoid the motel.
Like, generally speaking.
Moira: David, what should we do?
Should we be walking ahead, how far ahead should we be walking?
- Uh - Alexis: I'm just gonna walk, 'cause I don't even care what's going on right now.
Keep walking, okay?
!
Walk, walk, walk!
Um what's going on?
Oh Okay, um, so you weren't here for me today.
Okay.
Well, it's just a casual hang, - you know, we talked about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's totally fine, I'm just I'm tasting metal, for some reason.
Um Alexis: Oh God, David, this is so awkward!
Moira: What?
What's happening?
Johnny: Well, I don't think Jake is here to see David.
We can hear you.
Very clearly.
Oh.
Stevie: Okay, He's early.
- I didn't know - No!
No, no.
- Okay, sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
- Uh -  - Have fun, you two.
- Oh John, no!
- Oh, right.
- Don't worry, David, I've been in this situation like, the most times, except I'm always the girl getting into the truck.
The least they could do is offer us a ride!
Okay, let's move please, people!
Twyla: All set, Mr. Rose?
Yes, Twyla, I think I'll have the eggs, and brown toast, over easy, The eggs, not the toast.
Comin' right up.
And I think I might ask for a Oh my God!
What happened?
Well, I went whitewater rafting, Oh no, well, that'll do it, I mean Anyway, it's fine now.
Yesterday it was this stabbing pain, but today it's more like a really intense throbbing.
Well, it's not urgent, not urgent.
I don't need coffee with breakfast, so.
I'll grab it right after I clear these.
Well, if it's not too much trouble?
Doris: Can I help you with those?
Oh, no, no.
Oh, you know, I can help, I can help with that, Twyla.
No, no, they say it's better to work through the pain.
- Really.
- Oh well, there you go.
If those are the doctor's orders No, I mean, I can help, Twyla.
I do have a bad back, But I-I can certainly uh - help out here.
- Oh!
David: Uh, who picked through my cake, and only left the icing?
Who eats the icing?
!
What kind of barnyard were you raised in, where you just eat someone else's food?
!
So you can share a boyfriend, but you can't share a piece of cake?
I'm not sharing a boyfriend, Stevie and I are both dating Jake, at the same time, like sexually evolved human beings.
Oh, okay, because in my experience with throuples We're not a "throuple"!
When it comes to three people, David, there's always a favorite.
It's just like how Mom likes you more.
That's not true, and please don't include Mom in an analogy about my relationship, thank you!
Moira: David, lunch today?
- No.
- Oh, okay.
Well, I'll dine alone.
See?
!
See what?
Alexis seems to think you like me more.
Alexis, don't be ridiculous!
This is exactly the kind of paranoia that makes me wary of spending time with you.
I was sitting right here, and you chose to eat lunch alone.
That is simply not true!
I didn't see you.
At first.
Alexis, I would be absolutely glee-ridden if you would have lunch with me.
Today.
No, no, no, no, no.
I wasn't actually You'll meet me at the cafe for their one o'clock sitting.
- Something wrong?
- No!
I should go.
Don't wanna set a bad example for the rest of the motel staff.
I thought you were the only one that worked there.
Yeah, that's another good reason to go.
All right, well, I'll drive you.
Mm, I think I'll walk.
I'm trying very hard not to repeat what happened last night.
Hmm, and here I am trying very hard to repeat what happened last night.
I meant you picking me up.
And David and his family.
Ohhh!
Yeah, yeah.
Could've timed that one better.
Yeah.
Well, I guess that's bound to happen sooner or later in this sort of situation, right?
I'm sensing that this whole setup is becoming a bit of a problem for David.
Yeah, he's just very fragile.
- He's like a snowflake.
- Yeah.
I just think maybe it's time he and I have a chat.
Oh!
No!
That's not I mean, that's not what I was implying!
No, no, not at all.
This is a This is a good idea.
For him and for us.
Uhhh Here we go, Twyla.
Table Five, a Caprese salad, and a ginger ale.
Thank you, Mr. Rose, I really appreciate this.
Oh!
Yeah, it looks like the morning rush is finally dying down.
Maybe I can get the kitchen to whip up a fresh batch of eggs for us volunteers.
Roland: Uh, Twyla, honey, whenever you're ready.
- I'll be right there!
- Okay.
Would you please pass me my crutch?
- Not a problem.
- Unless No, it's right here.
No, I was gonna say unless you could possibly take their order?
I just need to cash out Table Three.
Sure, no, I can I can do that.
You know, it's funny, I said eggs, but uh I'm gonna be ready for lunch soon.
Moira: No, I hear your concern, it's just apparently what geese do.
No, it's not the town's problem, You're just going to have to watch where you step.
I don't want to hear the I don't want No, I don't wanna hear that!
Okay, I'm gonna take an early lunch.
Twyla's got a broken foot, so lunch could take a while.
- You coming?
- Yes, let me just get Oh wait, I don't think I can.
Okay, I didn't think it'd be such a tough decision, so No, Ronnie!
I would love nothing more than to lunch with you today, but I believe I'm lunching with Alexis.
It's kind of a mother daughter thing.
Oh, a little bonding time.
Yes, and what's so wrong with that?
!
I don't know, is there something wrong with that?
Well, just because my daughter and I don't do that sort of thing doesn't mean it's impossible!
And I'm sure you'll have a really good time.
Yes, we will!
We will!
Once I break the ice with a provocative question or two.
Sure.
And then there's the banter about the food, that always eats up some time, doesn't it?
As long as you don't over think it.
Oh, no.
Ronnie!
If you're still there when we arrive, might we perhaps push our tables together?
Yeah, perhaps.
Hey!
Um, you don't need me to work through lunch today, do you?
Would that be to make up for the work you were supposed to be doing this morning?
I took one tiny break to watch two episodes of "Scandal" with Mrs. McCreary, while she waited for her dog!
Why do you wanna work through lunch?
Um no, I just thought you might need me, and um, I wanted to see if I needed to cancel this lunch that I have at the cafe with my mom.
No need, have lunch with your mom.
Okay, cool.
Um, I totally don't mind though, if you want me to stay.
Is everything okay with your mom?
Absolutely!
Why?
Well, it's just you've offered to work through lunch three times now, and most days I can barely get you to come back after lunch.
Thank you, Ted.
No, everything's fine, it's just we don't spend a lot of time together just the two of us, which is why it's totally easy to just rain-check.
Isn't that all the more reason to go?
I mean, I try to have lunch with my mom at least once a week.
And sometimes lunch will turn into dinner, because we get carried away chatting, and For sure, for sure.
Okay, well I guess lunch is free, then.
So I guess I will see you tomorrow.
Oh, well, there's still work to be done, so probably best if you come back after lunch.
Okay, but nothing during lunch, though.
Maybe?
Tell your mom I say hi.
Okay thanks.
Well, I guess I was a bit premature thinking the morning rush was over.
- Yeah.
- Here you go.
Table five, seven and eight, and the big group at twelve, separate cheques, if you can.
Thank you, Mr. Rose.
And I've got a steak sandwich here with your name on it.
Oh, you shouldn't have!
Just one thing before you start Yeah, steak sauce, I know, you read my mind.
Actually, I was gonna ask if you could take this to table four.
Oh!
Yes, yes, I can.
And then I'll be back for that sandwich, avec sauce.
Here you go.
I didn't order this, I ordered the fish.
That's mine, the full combo?
Female Customer: I wanted to order the fish.
Well, you can order the fish.
He told me not to, he said it was off.
The fish is off?
!
No, no, the fish is fine, it's just uh, you know, it was a bit fishy.
Female Customer: You know what, I'll just order the full combo instead.
Okay, but just to be clear, the combo is a cup of soup, - and a half a sandwich.
- Then what is that?
It's the full combo.
- There is no full combo.
- He said there was.
Well, not-not in those words.
No, I said we'll see what we can do.
Well, what's this, then?
That's just a soup and a sandwich.
But there is a deal, right?
No.
- You said it was a combo.
- No, no, I said it was like an evolution of a combo.
But there's no deal?
!
Well, there is a deal on the combo, which is a cup of soup, and a half a sandwich.
So what's this gonna cost me?
Well, I-I think we can uh, charge you for two uh, half combos.
There is no half combo!
It's just a cup of soup, and a half a sandwich!
Johnny, if I get the soup with the brisket, is that then the full combo?
- Mr. Rose?
- Yeah, I'll fix it, uh, Twyla.
All right, just soup, and a sandwich.
- Hey!
- Hello!
Hey.
Hey.
I'm so glad we're doing this.
Me too!
When your father comes over, just act like everything's normal.
Is there something not normal about us being here?
It's not normal for your father to be waiting tables at a rural sandwich counter.
Eww!
What's happening?
He thinks he's working.
Just play along.
Well, can I get you ladies started with anything that is not a combo?
Um, I will have a mixed green salad, and some chicken.
Me too, something in common already.
Salads, good.
Simple.
And I will get the dressing on the side, please.
You'll get your dressing on the salad, like everyone else.
Hmm!
Hmm.
So huh, this is new.
Well, a lot more people are seeing my body these days, so I just thought I would What's going on?
I just wanted to check in, you know, after that whole thing last night.
Was it a whole thing?
I mean, I went to dinner with my family, and you had a romantic rendezvous with someone that we're both seeing.
- So - Yeah.
- That.
- Well, I'm fine with it.
Me too.
I just wanna make sure that we're still fine, you know, down the line.
Because what if things get complicated?
What would make things complicated?
Nothing!
But the last thing we want is a situation where one person is breaking up with another person, and that person is hurt, because things have gotten complicated!
Okay, I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped in an Avril Lavigne lyric here.
And while I not-so-secretly love Avril, and have paid very close attention to her battle with Lyme disease, um, I don't know why we're Okay.
If you knew somebody was planning on breaking up with you, wouldn't you wanna be the one to break up with him first?
Okay, if you think he's going to break up with you and you wanna be the first one to do it, I say, be the first one to do it.
Okay, I'm doing this wrong.
I need to be more direct.
Yes, by just telling him how you feel.
I think it'll benefit everyone.
- I meant you!
- Me?
I'm trying to warn you That you are going to be ending things with him.
And I appreciate that, but message has been delivered.
- Oh my God.
- Loud and clear.
- Uh -  Oh.
Okay, it's Jake, so um Oh, okay.
Don't worry, I'm gonna let you tell him.
- Okay.
- Hello?
Yeah, no, I was just um I was just doing squats, actually.
Ugh!
Mmm!
Um, I love having salad for lunch.
It's just, it's not heavy.
No, well, a heavy salad might as well be a casserole.
Mhmm  So, how are working at the animal hos- Uh, how is working at the animal hospital?
- Fine.
- That's marvelous.
And uh, your daily exercise routine What are you looking at?
- It's-well, it's a napkin.
- Let me see this.
You had to prepare questions?
!
I wouldn't categorize them as questions exactly.
"What's your favorite color"?
- Black.
- That's one of the questions!
It's right after, "how is your job at the animal hospital"?
Is it a crime, Alexis, that I had so many queries for you that I wrote them down in anticipation of forgetting them?
Well, you wouldn't need these if you were having lunch - with David.
- Oh, Alexis, please.
I wasn't even sure you'd show up.
Why wouldn't I show up?
You've never wanted to spend time alone with me.
There, I said it.
You never asked.
Bordeaux?
!
The trip I planned for the two of us?
That was a wine tasting tour, and I was seven years old!
You could've used the spittoon, That's what the other children did.
But you weren't interested.
It was as if you didn't want to be seen with me.
Well, did you ever wonder why?
To revel in my misery?
No, it's because you were always being recognized.
- Yes - No!
Not now.
Like before.
Didn't you enjoy the warm glow that Mummy's spotlight cast upon you?
- No!
- Alexis!
If I'd known you didn't like the attention, I would've chosen to be alone with you, and not out in public, among the throngs of fans.
I don't remember throngs.
I never meant for you to think that I didn't wanna spend any time with you.
Well I hope it's not too late to make up for lost time.
Okay.
What is your favorite season?
Awards.
Uh, what are you doing here?
I'm meeting Jake.
To break up with him?
No, I thought you spoke to him on the phone before?
I did, he invited me here for dinner.
Uh - Hi!
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
Oh, you both look amazing.
Great.
Muah!
- Oh.
Hi - Hey.
Muah!
- Mhmm.
- Sit, please.
Oh, okay.
No, I think there's been a mix-up here.
I don't think I should be here for this.
Oh, no, no, I think it's very important that you're here for this.
Okay, here for what?
Johnny: Well, good evening.
David, Stevie.
- Mr. Rose.
- Hello again.
I take it we'll be dining together as a group tonight?
Or will you be taking turns?
Um, first of all, what are you doing here?
!
And second, we're gonna need a minute.
- So - Yeah, sure, take your time.
Okay.
David, may I?
Yeah.
I know this hasn't been easy on you lately, and that doesn't make me feel good.
And I know Stevie's been feeling it a little bit, too.
Has she?
That's why I think there's only one thing for me to do.
Oh, I should go.
- No.
No.
- Okay I think we all need to be in this together.
Now, you've been with each other, and you've both been with me.
Let's all be with us.
Let's all be with us?
All of us.
Together.
- Mm, 'Kay.
- Yeah I don't think that's gonna work.
Stevie, we talked about this.
You talked about this?
!
You said you didn't want to make things complicated!
Yeah, that's why I invited you both here.
Wow, okay.
Hmm, I think maybe I misread the situation here.
Yeah, I think that's a pretty accurate realization.
Uh huh!
Might've done.
Okay.
Okay, maybe it's best we all just take a step back from this.
- Okay.
- Yeah, maybe that's that's the best thing to do.
- Mhmm.
- Well This one's for you, Muah!
- And you.
- Oh!
I get one.
- Mhmm, Muah!
- Okay.
All right, I'll see 'ya.
Ah!
To be clear, you were going to go on a date with him, knowing that he had just broken up with me?
No I wasn't.
Uh, you showed up for the date.
No I didn't.
You're literally here in the restaurant!
Because I was gonna tell him that I was breaking up with him.
Ohhh, okay.
Uh, yeah, fine.
But if it makes you feel any better, nobody hates me more than me.
Generally speaking.
Fair enough, I would've done the same thing.
There you go Mr Rose.
This is your share of the tips.
Oh Twyla, I can't take any money.
I insist, you earned it.
Well, I have to admit, I haven't worked this hard in a long time.
I'm glad to hear it.
Although the things some of these customers can put you through!
Oh, I know.
Joking when you're way too busy, trying to tell you how they want their food cooked.
I've experienced a bit of that myself.
Yeah, you know, I think maybe um you should keep my share of the tips.
That's not necessary, Mr. Rose.
No, just think of it as a little reparation pay.
Well, that doesn't even begin to cover it!
To not following too closely in her footsteps.
We're drinking to me not becoming an alcoholic.
Mhm.
Off to a good start.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
What are these sad print-outs?
They're for a proposal I plan on making to the family.
And what kind of proposal is this, Mr. Rose?
Are the police auctioning off crime scene vehicles?
No, these are only examples, uh, for the proposal.
I think it's time we invest in a car.
I really don't see myself driving any of these.
Now, these are just examples.
Yeah, I would rather drive a scooter.
And we all know how I feel about scooters, those stupid helmets.
All right, let's forget the print-outs.
All right?
I just think we could use a car.
Everyone has a car!
Roland has a car, Bob has three cars.
Stevie has a car.
I want a car!
Does this site have boats?
Okay, here's what I put together.
- Is that a spreadsheet?
- Yes, yes, it is.
And if you'd just let me finish the pitch the way I planned it, things will be a lot more clear.
Okay, well, I'm gonna need the car on Friday nights.
Absolutely not.
Meaning that I would get it Saturday.
We don't even have the car yet!
Okay, we're just trying to work within your schedule.
Ohh!
This is not your best pitch, darling.
I haven't even started the pitch, Moira!
Okay, you know what?
!
I'm buying a car!
End of story.
Where are you going?
Here.
You know, really don't have to go with me, Moira.
Oh, I insist.
This is a big decision, and there's no reason it should rest solely on your shoulders, dear.
You know, I actually like buying cars.
And you're very good at it.
But, sometimes your choices are less suited to a family's needs, and more suited to a pony-tailed Lothario, cruising the Monte Carlo coast.
Or like um, Vin Diesel.
It's called style, people.
And you're brimming with it, darling.
But each of us is going to drive this, and a car says a lot about a person.
Not that we can afford a car that says a lot about us, We did decide to only budget $4,000 of my money.
You know, he's got a point there, honey.
We can't be eating into the family funds.
Well, fault my over-zealousness, but I think I can We can find a zippy little vintage something on budget.
Not dressed like that, you can't.
You bought me this dress, David.
I know!
And it cost twice as much as the car you wanna buy.
No used car salesman is gonna cut you a deal dressed in archival designer silk.
You know, he's got a point there, honey.
Yeah, says the moving target in the Bespoke suit.
Well, I'm not just gonna be wearing a suit today, David.
I've got a ball cap I can put on.
- Oh!
- David's right.
But you know what?
I could build an appropriate look to mimic the trappings of a workaday woman.
And if you'll notice, David, - no cufflinks.
- Wow!
I am blinded by the disenfranchisement.
I wouldn't be surprised if they just gave you the car.
Hey, sorry I'm late, there was very heavy foot traffic on the way over.
Do you mind putting these in Mrs. Hertzman's file?
Oh, hello!
Who is this cool cat, and what did he do with Ted?
Very funny.
Unfortunately, the alternative isn't quite so cool.
Oh my God, what happened?
Did you get in a bar fight?
Uh, you know, I'd actually prefer not to talk about it.
Okay Just for the sake of maintaining some professional boundaries.
Yeah, okay, totally.
You owe someone money.
Alexis, I pay off my credit card bills two weeks in advance, what do you think?
Okay, then why are you being so weird about it?
I'm not being weird about it.
You're entitled to keep things private from me.
Okay, fine.
I know that they are for the animals, but I find that when I get tired, just one or two kind of help me focus.
What are you talking about?
!
Anyway, um, secret or no weird secret, we've gotta cover that thing up.
I hope you're not into contouring, 'cause it's not really my thing.
So the low energy bulbs you installed in the bathroom, I'm finding the light to be very harsh, and um did someone die, or are we going through like, a mid-life Goth phase?
Someone died.
Okay, I'm just finding the bulbs to make my skin look very jaundice-y.
My great aunt died.
Okay, I can't tell if we're still joking - or not?
- I'm not.
Okay, and now I can't tell whether you're playing into the joke, or whether um - you're telling the truth.
- She was 78.
So you're not joking.
Okay.
Um, well first, I'd like to apologize for everything I've said since coming in here today.
Why, you didn't kill her.
I take it you weren't very close.
I actually really liked her.
I mean, she was a mess, but I liked her.
That's probably why I liked her.
Anyways, it turns out I'm one of the few who did, because all of the arrangements have fallen to me!
Oh.
Um, well if you need hel  I'd like you to finish that sentence.
Oh!
Um, I am happy to help you in this time of need.
Thank you, as much as I appreciate your reluctant offer, I don't think you could handle it.
This whole thing is super depressing.
Okay, I think will be fine.
So I am happy to help.
That is what um, friends say to each other, right?
Yes, it is.
Okay.
Um so I'm just gonna change into my funeral blacks.
And um, and meet you back here, then.
Oh, sorry, we don't want any.
I'm just joking.
Come on in!
No, I'm not!
- Johnny: Roland!
- Just let him in, Rollie!
Come on in!
Thank you.
Entree vous, s'il vous plait.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Jocelyn.
Would you like to join us for a game of cribbage?
We play every day at lunch.
That's right, and Fridays, it's strip crib.
Well, thank God it's not Friday.
Well, we can pretend.
Now, I'm not staying long, I just came by to borrow some clothes.
Ah, okay.
Honey, why don't you check your closet, and see if you got anything that Johnny can fit into.
Look, Moira and I are going to a used car lot today, and I just need to appear more um Official?
Casual.
Casual.
You see, I've got a closet full of suits, but uh, I don't wanna be taken advantage of because I'm overdressed, I need to look like I don't have money.
But you don't have any money.
Oh, I know I don't have any money, but I need to look like I don't have money.
Ohhhh, okay.
Here's what I'm hearing you say, what you're saying is you wanna dress like me, because I look like I don't have any money!
I think I misspoke.
Well, that's what I heard out of both ears, one of them works pretty well.
I mean, anything that looks um, hip!
I need something hip.
Hipper than these suits.
- Hip!
Oh jeez, yeah!
Now you're speaking my language!
Hip we can do!
What do you want, uh PVC, or a Hawaiian shirt?
-  - Funeral Director: Sorry about the mess.
We're in the middle of a move.
Now unfortunately, we haven't quite found your Aunt Maureen's ashes, but, we know they're here somewhere.
Okay, well, that's encouraging.
The problem is they all come in from the crematorium on the same day, and sometimes, they're not labeled.
Oh?
Is it possible someone else picked them up?
Unlikely.
I see your great aunt has a sister.
Yeah, they haven't spoken in 20 years.
- And a step-son.
- He's in prison.
- And a cousin.
- Who's also deceased.
- What?
- I didn't know.
That side of my family has a bit of a reputation - for conflict.
- Okay.
And philandering.
- And fraud.
- Yeah And gun-play.
Well, I'm sure her remains will turn up.
But we should talk about urns for your aunt.
We'll just get this one, I guess.
Well, that's the shipping tube we pack the urns in.
Found them.
They were on top of the microwave.
Wonderful.
Oh, that reminds me.
Can you get us some whitener for the coffees?
Oh what have I been using?
Okay, I'm gonna put that down.
And what about the service?
Well, since it's just gonna be us attending, I think we can do without.
I see now, I know this may sound premature, but have the two of you thought about the planning of your own funerals?
Okay I think we got what we came here for, so we-I think we can just thank you so much.
-  - What?
Well, if I squint, I feel like I'm seeing your rough and rugged country cousin.
Oh, and you feel confident you've hit the target with this?
!
I apprenticed costume design under Stan LaCoulier.
I'm sure he'd agree this toggery is the perfect tribute to the common woman.
Oh, John, look.
It's our car!
Well, Moira, let's not pick the first car we see.
No, before David was born!
We bought a car just like this, don't you remember?
Well, I don't remember the "Everything Be Irie" bumper sticker.
Oh no, it's perfect!
- Hello!
- Moira!
This car is $3,000 more than our budget.
I'm a trained actor.
A humble back story will disabuse this man of any notion we're too patrician.
Well, okay, but let's start by losing words like "patrician".
Hey folks, how we doin' today?
Oh, excited beyond compare!
Yes, especially with this being our first ever purchase of an automobile.
Yes, it's our first car, let's hope we can afford it.
Yes, my poor 'usband, lost his job recently as a tennis pro, yes, at a public resort, that is, yeah.
Well, let's get you folks settled inside, we'll see what we can do.
Oh, thank you.
It'll be nice to get off the streets, and be indoors for a change, yeah?
- Moira - What?
!
The truth is that, um We've-we've struggled with penury for quite some time now, well, just two years ago, we were practically 'omeless.
Where are you two from?
You know, I've been wondering that myself.
I'm from London, I was one of two identical twins.
Tragically, I was snatched from my crib at birth by Russian mobsters.
Mhmm, they looked at my fair skin, and my dazzling eyes, and they said, we'll make a pretty penny on that one, on the human black market, we will.
- And what about the twin?
- What's that, love?
Well, if you're identical, I thought you'd both be valuable.
Yes, wouldn't you?
She wasn't born yet.
Yep, she wasn't born.
'Til three minutes later, and the Bratva work very quickly.
That is quite a story.
- Isn't it?
-  Um, excuse me, I I'll be back in a moment.
I think he's buying it!
You think?
-  - Hey!
These are for you.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
Lisa dropped them off.
- Oh.
- Hey!
- Don't be embarrassed.
- I'm not embarrassed.
I know your little secret, and as your assistant I will be discreet, - and professional.
- What?
No one's gonna know that you're having an adventurous little rendezvous with an apple-cheeked farm-woman!
But that's not what happened!
- Wink.
-  I was making a house call to Lisa's farm, and got head-butted by her goat.
Is that when one of you is on the floor, and then the other one kind of just like hops No, uh I was head-butted by an actual goat.
And as a vet, that's not something that I want getting out, so please don't be thinking that this is something that it isn't.
Okay.
Sorry.
Those are delicious, by the way.
She practically begged me to try one.
So I did.
And I also took a couple for David.
Um, yeah, you're right, this is a bit depressing.
Are we sure this is the right place?
She was very specific about where she wanted to be scattered.
Um, so what are where-how Where should we do Well, I don't want people parking on her!
- Okay.
- So Maybe I could just put her on the grass over there?
Sure.
-  - Ooh, it smells like cigarettes.
- Ohhh - Um do we scatter it all, or do we - save some for later?
- Later?
!
- I don't know!
-  This is gonna be me.
Well, theoretically, it's gonna be all of us.
Um, although I'm hoping that when I pass, there'll be a little more fanfare.
My great aunt worked at the motel.
Front desk.
- You never told me that.
- Yep.
So I just need to take up palm reading, get a few cats, move to Saskatchewan.
Well, a girl could dream.
You are not your aunt!
From what I've heard, I wouldn't be friends with her, and I'm friends with you, so that's one major difference.
She made her decisions.
And you're going to make yours, and they are going to be different.
And they are going to be great.
And if they're not, I'll be sure to scatter your ashes in a much nicer parking lot.
I think I'm just gonna start pouring, okay?
- Okay, so - Okay.
Not here, though!
Let's go just over there.
Thank you very much for waiting.
- Oh.
- This is Sarah, this is my wife, and business partner.
Oh hi, is everything okay?
Well, I hope you can forgive me, but I couldn't help overhear your story.
Oh yes, love, it's an inspiration to many, I'm sure.
And it sounded so familiar.
But then I remembered "Sunrise Bay"!
My wife was addicted to your show!
Well, I find it's wonderful, but we don't have a television, so.
- Moira - I remember when your twin showed up, and stabbed Armand with her sharpened crutch.
Okay, look folks, I'm really sorry, my wife was simply trying to fictionalize our very real financial struggle.
Okay, that was fun.
There's no need to be embarrassed.
We read all about what happened to you, - losing everything.
- It's heartbreaking.
- We didn't lose everything.
- Well Seeing you working so hard, just to shave a few bucks off that Lincoln, which we could do.
But now you're making it sound like some act of desperation, it was simply just an act.
Um Moira, they're just trying to help us out by giving us a better price.
Well, nonsense, dear, we can certainly pay full freight.
You save that discount for someone who needs it!
Yes, okay.
Dear, look.
We really would appreciate any financial assistance.
Or perhaps we might have to take our business to a dealership that sells brand new cars.
As you can see, we can't even afford her meds right now.
I'll get the paperwork started.
Here we go, dear, here's the chair.
Hey, so I'm headed out, and I will drop off the flea shampoo for Ms. Warner's cat.
Sorry, what did Mrs. Warner say?
She called to ask if you would drop off flea shampoo, and she also asked if you would wash her cat, but I said that you were too busy.
Oh.
Y-yeah.
Uh okay, you know what, - I got this.
- I'm happy to do it.
Um do we even have flea shampoo?
Uh, it's fine, I-I'll do it.
It's best if I do it.
No, it's on my way home, and I rarely offer to do things like this, so.
Heather Warner doesn't actually have a cat.
Ohhh.
She like, thinks she has a cat?
That's so sad.
But I guess she is like 50, so that makes sense.
Yep, she's 42.
And she's not crazy.
It's code.
I'm kind of seeing Heather, and the flea shampoo is A booty call?
!
Well, I'm not crazy about the term, but Ted, look at you, Little Sexy Susan!
Okay, calling me "Susan" kinda takes the sexy out of it.
But I'm glad we were able to deal with this in a professional manner.
Ted, say hi to her cat for me.
- That's too far, Alexis!
-  To Maureen Budd, and not following too closely in her footsteps.
So we're drinking to me not becoming an alcoholic?
Mhmm.
-  - Off to a good start.
Hi, I'm looking for Stevie Budd.
- I'm her.
- Hi, we spoke on the phone, I'm Elaine, from West, Read and Healy.
I have some personal effects that were willed to you, - Oh - and some documents for you to sign.
Thanks.
Oh my God.
When did you have this photo taken?
That's not me.
That's Maureen.
Mmm.
Okay, well, just because you bear a vague physical resemblance, does not mean that you will end up in an apartment with newspaper for curtains.
Okay, this is not going to be you.
What is this?
That is the deed to the motel.
Sorry?
Maureen Budd owned the motel.
You didn't tell me that.
Nobody told me that.
I mean, I knew it was in the family, but I didn't know she outright owned it.
Was she of sound mind?
Uh well, according to her will, she wanted you to have it.
Was she of sound mind?
!
Okay, this still doesn't mean that you are going to be anything like her!
I mean sure, on the surface, it is a step in that direction, but, you know, um, okay, you know what?
- Let's clear some of this stuff.
- Yeah.
Starting with the urn.
And I'm-we're gonna just   You look like a contestant on "The Price Is Right".
Well, it worked, because the price was right.
How much did you pay for this?
David, it's not polite to ask what you paid for something.
It says $7,250 right there.
Well, that's way over budget!
Well, that's not what we paid for it.
Well, what did you pay for it?
!
$6,000 quid, love.
- Oh God!
- Thank you, Moira.
And it would've been a lot less, if your mother hadn't talked them back up!
You can't put a price on dignity.
Uh, tell that to your outfit.
This is your outfit.
- What?
!
- Okay, look.
The important thing is, we now have a car!
Is this a car for dead people?
No, it's not a hearse!
Look, this is a used car, so it's not perfect.
Were all the other cars on fire, then?
It's very big.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Johnny: Well, what do you think of the new wheels?
Do you want my honest opinion?
- Or - You got your wallet?
Um, I have my debit card.
And what about your license?
- What about it?
- Do you have it?
It's fine.
It was a yes or no question.
Okay, yes, it's fine.
We're going up the street, I don't need my license.
David, we just insured the car, and you can't drive it unless you have your license on you, so could you go get it, please?
It's expired.
- When did your license expire?
!
- I don't know!
Like, last month.
Then you're not driving!
Well, I drove the car yesterday!
- Well, that's illegal, David!
- Argh!
You need to go renew your license!
Alexis: Are you guys done with the car?
No, we're just leaving.
Okay, 'cause it looks like you're getting out.
We're changing seats because David's license is expired.
Oh no!
And it took him like, 16 tries to get it last time.
It didn't take me 16 tries!
I failed the written test twice, and then took the driving test, and passed!
And then your learner's permit expired, and you had to do the written test again, which you failed.
Oh, I remember this!
You had to start from scratch, and you failed the practical two more times.
God!
Moira: Oh, the poor thing has crippling test anxiety.
We all know that.
Who has the keys?
I need the car.
Well, we're using the car right now, sweetheart.
David, would you drive your mummy to Town Hall, please?
He can't drive, his license is expired.
Okay, I will drive.
You got your wallet?
It's fine.
- Ugh!
- Oooh!
So many boxes.
And most of them are filled with paperwork I have to go through, so I'm just hoping I contract some deadly lung infection from the dust before I have to open another one.
Um well, I wouldn't really worry about it, I managed several galleries, and never once looked at the paperwork, so.
It either all comes together, or it doesn't.
Ultimately.
Did it ever come together?
Um, I think we're getting sidetracked.
The upside is that you are your own boss now!
Or I'm the owner of a very sad business with one under-performing employee.
Okay, what I find helpful when I get overwhelmed is actually taking a step away for like, 15 minutes to an hour, to um, to maybe two hours, and ah, helping people.
I feel like there's a request coming on.
Mm, not so much a request, as it is an opportunity.
I am looking for a very lucky person to drive me to my driver's test.
Oh yeah, that's not gonna happen right now.
Um, I guess you're right.
I should probably be helping you.
I would love to run some errands, or you know, maybe pick something up, I just-I just need a valid driver's license.
The test is this afternoon.
And I'm very anxious about it.
And need a lift.
Um you know what?
I don't think this is a good time to ask.
Hmm, that's really perceptive.
Um, I'm gonna find someone with a little more time - on their hands.
- Okay.
Okay I don't know why you didn't ask me first, David.
I have my license in seven different countries, And I have my "F" Class.
Isn't that for transport trucks?
!
Yes, well, I had a lot of people to move!
Anyway, it's not a big deal.
You just get in, you do what they tell you, and then you get out.
And wear your best hair perfume.
Okay, I don't have hair perfume, and not all of us can flirt our way into getting a driver's license!
Okay, you try parallel parking in a burka, David.
No amount of flirting can get you out of that, trust me!
Okay, the big difference is that nothing seems to give you anxiety, which is actually sort of concerning.
Oh, that reminds me, can you hold the wheel for a second, I need to check my phone.
Oh my God!
I'll tell you what's not helping me right now!
- This!
- Hey, relax, David.
I once had a 7-year-old drive me around Mumbai, so I'm pretty sure you're cool to steer for a sec.
- Ugh!
- Okay.
Okay!
- Breaths!
-  - Breaths!
-     Oh Stevie, I don't mean to bother you, but um, there's a leaky faucet in David and Alexis' bathroom.
And this is a pressing issue for you?
Well, it's just that when you're in our bathroom, you can hear it clear as day, I mean, it's almost like it's happening in our bathroom.
But it's not.
So I'm just gonna finish this first.
- Hi.
- And Stevie, I'll need your telephone, please.
- Sure.
- Along with the number for a plumber.
The faucet is dripping in David and Alexis' room.
It's exasperating, the incessant tap, tap, tap Oh, it's so irritating, Stevie, it  But maybe this is uh not a good time.
Oh, boy troubles, no doubt.
We don't want to intrude, dear, just when you can, plumber, please.
Or get someone else to do it, Stevie, because you are the owner now.
Yeah!
And I don't know what I'm doing!
Oh!
None of us do, dear!
We're all just muddling through, aren't we?
I mean, look at John.
Why look at me?
!
I'm saying, even someone with a history of wild success can experience a downtick now and then.
Well, I didn't realize I had a downtick, Moira.
Just, I don't know what to do, do I sell the motel?
Sell the motel?
No, no!
No, no, that's not something you should be thinking about.
- Mmm!
- I mean, I can't keep it!
Okay Stevie, allow me to get you a pill.
It's going to make you forget every last one of those irrational thoughts for at least two days!
Yes, and Stevie, if you need any help at all, please, feel free to come by our room.
Well, I'll be at work.
But John will be there, implementing and strategizing.
And honestly, the drip is just uh, you know, a wish list project, lowest of priorities.
I'm-I just need a minute, and I'll do it.
- Sure, yes, of course.
- Oh, Stevie.
Courage!
Whoa!
John, you don't really think she'd sell the place, do you?
It would not bode well for us if she did.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car for 20 minutes, so that I can do my transcendental meditation before I fail this test.
Okay, you are acting all sorts of crazy right now.
This honestly does not matter.
Nobody cares.
Uh, people care.
I care, the driving examiner person cares.
No, he doesn't.
Trust me, people aren't thinking about you the way that you're thinking about you.
What does that mean?
You always over think everything, and that's why you fail all the time.
Thank you, Alexis.
Well, it's true!
Okay, just because everything falls in your lap, doesn't mean it falls in everyone else's.
What does?
!
- What?
- What falls in my lap?
Stuff!
Things.
Opportunities.
Things don't fall in my lap!
Okay, I'm just saying, that you've always just gotten stuff, without realizing that other people don't skate through life the same way you do.
I don't skate through life David, I walk through life.
In really nice shoes.
And I'm sorry if that rubs you the wrong way, but maybe if you could just relax for a second, and stop worrying about everything, everything would be easier for you!
And what I'm saying is that things haven't been as easy for me as they've been for you!
Um, yes, they have!
No, they haven't!
And now I'm even more stressed out than when I got in the stupid car!
Thank you very much for your help, Alexis.
Hey!
I'm the one that's supposed to be getting out of the stupid car, David!
The driving man's coming!
Oh my God!
David?
Nobody cares.
- I got it!
- Okay!
Johnny: Hey, Stevie.
Good news, I fixed the drip in David and Alexis' bathroom, so you can check that off your list.
Thank you.
You know, to be honest it's more a temporary fix, I put a sandwich bag over the faucet, and secured it with an elastic.
Oh okay, won't the drips fill up the sandwich bag?
Well, like I said, it's temporary, uh, but it might buy you a little time.
A little.
Ooh!
A ledger?
I haven't seen one of these in a while.
Aha, well, at first glance, what you think of say, charging for late check outs?
Yeah, again, that would assume that we had guests to check out.
Well, there's a solution to everything, Stevie, and when that idea comes, it's going to appear so obvious.
Well, I mean, I did think that I could start charging full price to the long term guests here.
And sometimes it's the second or third idea that's really the keeper.
- Hey.
- Afternoon.
Oh, Moira's in early.
Oh, just catching up on my reading.
Well, we'll leave you to it.
Oh dear, that's a shame.
That's a real shame!
The old pulp mill in Elmdale, torn down.
That reminds me, I gotta check out the new pulp mill.
I hear it's breathtaking.
But surely the old pulp mill had its charm, and it was an historic landmark.
Where'd you find that article?
!
The old pulp mill closed down what, two years ago?
Well, it just makes one think, might there be a building struggling in our town that could, with the aid of municipal funds, avoid befalling a similar fate?
Like the library.
Gwen does all her internet stuff there, you know, she worries about people tracing her IP address.
I was thinking of another worthy landmark, the motel.
Oh, that sounds like more of a personal issue.
Oh, it's very personal, for Stevie.
The poor thing is a wreck.
Inheriting the motel, feeling lost and alone.
She even threatened to sell the place!
A pitiable creature, that's what she is.
John and I, we both threw our arms around her, figuratively speaking, and we said, the people of this town, and Council in particular, will not let this business go under, Stevie.
For your sake, Stevie!
I thought you were against giving town funds to heritage projects.
Yeah, when we wanted to restore the war memorial, you said we should avoid taking sides.
But this cause affects everyone.
We all know, or are, people who live in the motel.
In closing, I move that we free up heritage funds for the motel, effective immediately, all in favor, say Aye.
Ronnie, you're with me?
I see that you're scratching.
Bob!
You're making a note!
Oh, just writing uh, "visit new pulp mill".
Yeah, Roland got me thinking.
I hear the floors are so clean, you can eat your lunch off them.
I laid those floors.
Okay, Derek.
You are gonna make a turn up ahead.
Uh, it's David.
Oh yep, sorry about that.
Um, I just didn't want you thinking you had gotten in the wrong car.
- Rose, David?
- Yes.
Sorry, it's been a long day.
Um, so a left or a right?
What?
You said there's a turn coming up, do you want a left turn, or a right turn?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a left.
- Okay.
- But when I tell you to make a left.
Okay.
Um, can I ask you a question?
Uh yep, failure to signal will be counted.
Um, how old are you?
- Twenty-eight.
- Mhmm, and is this like, what you would like to do for a career?
Well, I uh, I DJ on the weekends.
- Ah.
- Why?
So you don't really care about this.
Like, about me, in the car.
I mean, you care in the sense that it's your job, but you don't-you don't care about this, do you?
I've done like, eight of these today.
Is that a problem?
No.
Oh, there she is, back from council.
Any chance of a bailout?
I was very persuasive.
And there were lots of questions, that shows engagement.
Good, 'cause even with just a little cash flow, I think Stevie can get this motel back on its feet.
- Excellent.
- Yes.
And if she can get let's say, a volume discount on paper products, or offer deals on last minute bookings, then Well, it sounds to me like we may not even need those funds from Council.
Oh, no, no, we need the funds, that's for sure, but I'm just saying, if she took some of my suggestions Stop!
I want to remember this moment.
What moment?
I haven't seen you this excited in a very long time.
No, I'm just thinking of Stevie, and listen, how much money do you think we can get from council?
Well, now I'm wondering if that money might not just complicate things.
Look how much you've achieved with your back to the wall.
Necessity drives invention, and far be it from me to rob you of your necessity!
Well, I'm not thinking of getting that involved, Moira, I'm just offering a bit of advice.
You've been looking for a project, John.
Well, not running a motel, Moira, that's a commitment Or not!
Go!
Go tell Stevie of your decision.
What decision?
And I'll instruct Council to save their largesse for a more worthy charity.
You didn't get the money, did you?
Go, John!
Before the passion dies again!
So I assume you got your license, and you're not just driving us home illegally.
- I did.
- Good.
I know.
And how was your tester guy, was he a monster?
He was fine.
Slightly distracted.
Transitioning to a career as a DJ, but apparently none of the venues around here could handle his sound See?
I told you.
He didn't care.
You never trust me!
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't!
Yes, I do.
No, and you never take my advice.
And I'm always the last person you turn to.
What do you want me to say?
Well like, what makes me different than Stevie or Mom?
You trust them with stuff.
Okay, you wanna talk trust?
!
Stevie and Mom weren't running around the world for a decade and a half with random men, leaving me at home to wonder whether they were okay!
Well, I'm sorry for having fun, David.
With a selection of very confident international men.
- But I was always okay.
- Were you?
!
Because I was the one at the consulate sending you temporary passports, and colored contacts lenses whenever you needed them.
I was the one at home, not having fun because I was constantly worried which East Asian palace Alexis was being held hostage in this week.
Not Mom and Dad.
Me!
Well, you didn't have to worry about me.
Well, I did.
Ray: As your realtor I would take pictures, arrange viewings, dress each room with complimentary baskets of plastic foods.
Okay, and if we're going to do this, what would the timeline be like?
The sooner the better, I have my camera in the car.
What's going on?
Ray and I are just discussing Selling the motel.
I have to weigh all the options, Mr. Rose.
Yeah, I thought we talked about this?
Ray came to me.
There's never been a better time to sell a motel.
It's a terrible time to sell this motel.
Either way, in reality, it's always best to tell the client what they want to hear.
Yeah, but I think selling is not necessarily the best way to solve a problem.
Maybe we should discuss this at a later date, or um, when Mr. Rose has left the room.
Well, I'm not leaving, and Stevie's not selling.
I might be selling.
I-I can't do this on my own, so.
Well, maybe not on your own, but um what if you had a partner?
Stevie, as your agent, I would advise against partnering with somebody who has no capital, no contacts, no industry experience.
Well, thank you, Ray, but I did run a big corporation, and I'm perfectly capable of handling this.
And I think it's something I wanna do.
Oh well, this is all very exciting.
However, if any of this falls through for any reason, perhaps one of the ones I mentioned, then do give me a call.
Well, Stevie's not selling.
- Here's my card.
- Yeah.
Okay.
You don't have to do this, Mr. Rose.
Well, it's not charity, Stevie.
I mean I'll take a percentage of the profits, if and when this place ever sees any.
You're actually serious?
I'm getting more serious by the second.
Any help you need, accounting, sales, marketing Plumbing?
Plumbing, yes, it might keep me away from the books, but Oh, thank you so much!
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah I just feel like the whole session was rushed Like, there was no back lighting, or emotional direction.
Nobody likes their driver's license photo, David.
Okay yeah, I was just hoping I would get some options.
- Well - Ohhh!
It's done.
Have you been in there the whole time?
!
The sink doesn't fix itself.
Moira?
Kids?
Check it out.
- Ugh.
-  Okay kids, give it a spin.
Ahem.
You changed it so that the hot water comes out of the cold water tap?
No, I fixed the drip.
- Now, turn it off.
- What are we all looking at?
Um, Dad messed up our tap.
No, I fixed the drip.
Turn it off, honey.
It's getting hotter.
Okay well, turn it the other way, then.
Turn it off!
Ow!
Ow!
It's burning my hand now!
- I see steam, John.
- Okay, well, how do you turn it off?
- It's a tap, just turn it off!
- I turned it off!
Good!
Good!
See?
No drip.
I'm gonna go.
Ow!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1   Hi.
Hi.
Um, your agent called; do you have any safety pins?
My agent?
Which one?
I think the assistant said her name was Jennifer?
Ginnifer?
Or Jennifer with a "G"?
There's more than one!
They sent you an email.
Is it a job?
I don't know, do I look like Ginnifer?
!
David, your inability to retain information that doesn't directly pertain to you might actually require medical attention!
Are they sending a script?
David there's nothing here but "hot singles in my area".
No, wait, wait.
David, it's an audition for a feature film!
Well, that sounds promising.
"Attractive and spunky forty-something female".
In my sleep!
"Respected ornithologist Dr. Clara Mandrake," in the psychological thriller, "The Crows Have Eyes Two".
It's a sequel, that's good.
It must mean the first one was a big success.
I've never heard of it.
Well, they want me to put myself on tape.
David, do you still have that camera?
Go get it, please!
And a drop cloth.
And a ring light.
I could probably prop my phone against some books.
And so it begins again.
Good morning.
I'd like to book some rooms, please.
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
Good good.
Um, is there a problem?
Uh no, no problem.
I can certainly handle this.
My associate usually works the computer, But uh let's get you booked.
I'd like to book three rooms.
Three rooms?
Okay - Now will that be uh, three -  separate uh, bookings?
You see, there's a conference over in Elmdale, and I was hoping to use the motel as a kind of a breakout space to conduct my own business out of, - for the next two days.
-  During the afternoons.
-  - Okay, we seem to be having a bit of a problem with the system here, but not to worry.
Are you new at this?
Ish.
Well, not to complicate things for you even more, um, Johnny, but I would love if we could work out some kind of a discounted deal, seeing as we're not gonna be needing the rooms during the evenings.
Okay, um tell you what.
Why don't I go to a fresh page here, and we'll get this done.
Lickety-split, okay.
- So - I would love to pay cash.
Whew!
Even better.
Moira: From what I understand it's between me, and one other actress.
Congratulations, Mrs. Rose!
Who's the other actress?
- Well, they haven't found her yet.
- Oh.
But if all goes according to plan,  they'll be flying me out for a screen test!
Moira, I was just thinking about you!
Well, thank you.
What if we switched parts?
- Switch parts?
- For the duet next week.
Oh Jocelyn, the duet.
I must apologize, there seems to have been a change of plans.
Moira's gonna be in a movie!
- A movie?
- Well I'm sure you've seen "The Crows Have Eyes".
This would be the second in the franchise.
- Wow.
- Mhmm.
I have never heard of it, but congratulations.
Thank you.
Shame about the duet, though.
Yeah, we were gonna have a pretty incredible audience for the performance next week.
Big tour group coming through, so Then you'll cut the number.
No, I don't think that's a possibility, actually.
Twyla, what if you took Moira's part for the duet next week?
I would be honored!
God, it'd be such big shoes to fill.
No, Twyla, no.
No deprecatory mocking.
One must champion oneself and say, I am ready for this!
Otherwise, the pressure could be crippling.
Look at this filth!
"Community center adds ramp".
No, this.
He says the comma's a typo, but it has run that way three years in a row!
Who is this person?
He looks like if Ricky Martin and Mark Consuelos had a baby.
It's the competition, and he's selling his body to get clients, it's disgusting!
You could probably take just as sexy a photo if you wanted to.
I could definitely take just a I don't want to.
Let me ask you this question.
Why should the person who is performing surgery on your pet have to have a six pack?
!
- You have a six pack.
- That's not the point!
And it's not a full six yet, That's why I'm shredding right now.
I don't know, it looks like a pretty smart campaign to me.
If he wants to sell sex, then he should just get a job down at the Dude Cave!
He'd make more money than being a vet!
Um, what's the Dude Cave?
It's the all male strip club outside of town.
My cousin Dwayne works there; he drives a Corvette.
Okay Listen, you might wanna think about spicing up your approach a little bit.
The bottom line is that I did not go to med school just to exploit innocent puppies as a cover for my extreme vanity!
But people love extreme vanity!
And they love puppies, so you have to give them at least one of the two.
I don't know.
Oh!
What about the bunnies that we have up for adoption?
We can set up like, a little bunny cam, and stream it live from our clinic.
That is very popular with people who hate their jobs, or are in loveless marriages.
Are those the people we wanna be targeting?
Well, it's free marketing, and you can find little homes for those little bunnies that don't have any houses.
Fine!
But if those bunnies feel exploited even a little bit, - I am pulling the plug!
- Yes.
Honeypea.
Moira: Okay this is really taking me back.
Okay David, I'll need you to count me in.
Okay, um, from what?
Start from five, you leave out the two, and the one.
Okay, why?
Because it's my process.
Okay.
Um Five, four One.
Look what you've done!
Look at it!
Lying there, lifeless.
Yet, in its eyes, I see darkness.
It's just a crow, Mrs. Mandrake.
Dr. Mandrake.
And you must be kidding yourself if you don't think more are not coming.
They always do.
They're watching you, Gareth.
The crows have eyes.
And you better not look them in it.
Uh, it-it's just a flock of crows, Dr. Mandrake.
What's the worst that can happen?
Oh, you'll see!
And it's not a flock, my dear boy it's a murder.
Yes, I said murder.
Gareth, murder!
Sorry, um, this is just one big rip off of "The Birds"!
This is about crows!
It's much more specific!
And the dialogue!
"Look, they've taken Clara"!
"Where are they carrying her to, Clara"?
Are there two Claras?
!
It's a common name.
Yeah, the next scene takes place in a large bird's nest.
Rarely is the material of quality, the challenge is to lift it off the page.
And I think part of the problem, David, is that I'm getting nothing from you.
It's like working off a corpse.
I actually think you do play off a corpse in the next scene, and if I'm being perfectly honest, this is all playing a bit big.
Hmph!
Big.
- Yeah.
- And would that be a note?
A note, coming from my son?
!
Who I carried for almost a full seven months, to an actress who has been short-listed for more than seven major made for television motion pictures?
The script is nothing more than a jumping off point.
Oh, okay.
Let's take it again, I'll count myself in.
- Five, four, three, two -  Johnny: Great news!
Your new partner just booked three rooms, before you even got in this morning.
Wow.
Ha!
Three rooms, two days, "afternoons only, Trish".
What's afternoons only?
Well, I gave her a discount, because she's only using the rooms during the day.
So you're renting our rooms by the hour?
!
We haven't had a guest in four days!
What are they using the rooms for?
Well, she didn't say, Just conducting her business out of them.
Right, and you know what that means.
- No.
- Yeah.
No, I-I don't believe you.
Let me guess, this has something to do with the accountants conference?
Yes.
No, no, you're mistaken.
Stevie, she would've disclosed that information if that were the case!
- Really?
- No But look, if it makes you feel any better, we'll go and check it out.
But when it turns out I'm right, and it's just a group of business professionals decompressing for a few hours, during a long day at a regional accountants' conference, then I expect a full apology.
You don't hear it, when you say it like that?
I hear it a bit.
- Hi.
- Come look at this, look at the bunnies!
Oh  Cute!
This isn't one of those animal rights viral videos where the bunnies go through a meat processor in the end, is it?
Ew, no, David.
I set this up to get people to visit Ted's website.
Poor thing is, like, out of it when it comes to selling himself.
There are 200 people watching this, David!
That's like, double your Instagram followers.
Okay, my account is private, thanks.
Mhmm There's Ted.
Yeah, sometimes he comes in and out.
Um Ted is taking his clothes off.
You wish, David.
No, Ted is getting naked on your webcam!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I emailed our entire client list about this, David!
I emailed his parents!
I'm obsessed with this.
This is incredible!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
- Ted looks good.
- Yeah, he does.
- David, he looks really good.
- Okay, that's gross.
Okay, so  David!
Oh, hi.
Hi.
Uh, I and my associate, just wanted to come by and check on you, and see how you're enjoying your multiple room stay?
Oh, we're doing just fine, thank you.
Good, good, good.
Because we've heard through the rumor mill that um there have been some unannounced visitors staying in the rooms we rented you.
Visitors who may be engaging in mature, if not adult activities.
And?
And that's something we didn't discuss.
Miss, if I were to tell you Oh no, no, I got it immediately, and I wasn't even there, so.
Okay, well unfortunately, we're gonna have to ask you to shut it down.
Oh, you have nothing to worry about, Mr. Rose.
We're a very high-end operation, and very discreet.
Besides, people are making love in these rooms, whether they rent by the day, the week, or the hour.
Yeah Yeah, well Point taken.
Wow.
Hey, you know, I've tried to add an extra half hour to my morning run, but my body just isn't having it.
- Well, you look great.
- Thanks.
Um, about the bunny cam I know, it's a huge hit!
We've gotten like nine new customers overnight!
And some of them don't even have pets, they just want to discuss whether or not they should get a pet.
Ted, the camera can see you.
Okay, so should I like, wave or something, next time?
Nope, the camera can see you like, after your run.
Oh.
Oh no, why didn't you tell me the camera could see me when I get back from my runs?
!
I just noticed!
Actually, David noticed first last night, but that's exactly when there is a huge spike in the website.
- I'm worse than Dr. Miguel!
- No, you didn't know!
Although there was a moment last night, where it looked like you might have known, and you were doing this like, - thing with your hips.
- Alexis!
No, I know, of course you didn't know.
Of course!
Um, don't worry, I'm gonna take it down right now.
W-Wait.
You said you saw a spike in the website views?
People were very concerned as to whether or not you would get your pants on successfully.
Well who's to say that people weren't watching for the bunnies?
I am, that's what I'm saying.
I feel that until these guys are adopted, we can't take it down, that'd be bad for business, for the bunnies' sake.
I'll just have to be more careful next time.
Um hello, who are you, and what did you do with Theodore Mullins?
Well, what can I say, sometimes I like to live dangerously.
While still respecting my personal boundaries.
- Yes.
-  Moira: David!
So what is it?
- It's an email.
- Mhmm!
Subject line, "The Crows Have Eyes II".
- Mhmm.
- And?
I don't know, I'd like you to read it, please.
- You booked it.
- Ohhhh!
David!
I did?
What'd they say about me?
They need you to sign the contract!
Well, that's standard!
What are the terms?
Ooh, it's filming in Bosnia!
Um, in a city that I don't, I don't know the name of the city, I can't pronounce it, a lot of consonants.
I did not know that.
But I've always loved shooting on location, it allows one to focus on the work.
Hmm, it's being released in Bosnia, Croatia, Herzegovina.
Before opening internationally!
You have to fly yourself there?
Mmm, that doesn't sound right.
Ooh, accommodation is covered.
Thank God!
You'll be put up with a local family.
Close to the set?
They're paying you scale.
But it'll be in Baltic currency, do you want me to keep going?
No, read to yourself.
- There's a death waiver?
!
- Ohh!
You can close the computer.
Yeah, but we haven't even gotten to the section on bird safety yet!
Shut it!
Now.
What if Hmm.
No, thank you.
Have a nice rest of the day.
Hey Johnny, wow!
This place is hopping!
Yeah, well, it's uh, it's been a busy week.
Uh huh, you know, I gotta tell you, when I first heard that Stevie was hitching her wagon to your cart, the first thing that came into my mind was, whoooa, Nelly!
That horse is in big trouble.
A convoluted metaphor, but um But I've gotta say, you've proven me wrong, I mean, obviously, you're doing something right here.
Yeah, well, once again, thanks for coming by, Roland.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Johnny, look.
I know it makes you uncomfortable when somebody gets real with you, but could we just have one minute when I compliment you, and you don't go all, "Ooh Roland, my generation, we don't talk about our feelings, we keep 'em all rawrrr inside"!
Yeah well, that's not it, but once again, thanks for coming by.
Hey, one of you guys Ken?
Ken?
No.
Hi.
I'm Roland, Roland Schitt, mayor.
- Roland Schitt.
- Kitty.
Kitty, how are you?
Are you enjoying your stay in our town?
- It's been really good, Mhmm.
- Oh Hmm.
So Roland look, why don't we head down to the office, if we uh, wanna chat.
Who's Ken?
Well, Ken is probably her husband.
Uh huh, and she doesn't know what he looks like?
- Gentlemen.
- Uhhh Ah.
- Excuse me.
- You betcha.
Oh, Johnny.
Well, I see why you've had such a great week.
Okay, I don't know what you're implying, But I don't like your tone.
Johnny, please.
This little operation has been on the council's radar for quite a while now, And I'm sorry, but that was no Sunday school teacher coming outta here!
Okay look, this whole thing was a mistake.
This whole thing!
But I'm working on it, I'm working to shut it down, quickly.
Well, I'm really happy to hear that, because I would hate to have to assert my mayoral authority in a situation like this, yes?
Yeah, and nobody wants to avoid that more than me.
Good, okay.
Well, you know what, I'm glad I helped you fix your uh, broken moral compass.
Well, there's nothing wrong with my moral compass, but All right, well, why don't we tell Kitty that?
Ah, I'd love to see that!
So, I was thinking for the chorus - Yeah?
- We could sway, like we're actually islands in the stream.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Hi, I'm here!
Moira, what about your big movie?
Oh that, they're still hounding me, but I took a moment to stop and think about what is really important in life, and while the Bosnian Riviera is a majestic locale, it can't hold a candle to singing with you wonderful working women here, in our makeshift rehearsal studio.
Well, I'm flattered, but Twyla's been working on your part for the duet, and I really don't think that that would be in the spirit of things to take that from her.
But the song was my idea, Jocelyn.
John and I made David to that song, in Pusitano.
Hey, why don't we just show you how we're doing, and you can offer up some professional advice, for now.
Okay.
Jocelyn and Twyla: From one lover to another Uh huh Islands in the stream  Jocelyn and Twyla: That is what we are K-H-E-O-K!
No one in between How can we be wrong  Sail away with me to another world  We'll be lying with each other, uh huh Uh huh
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1  Okay well, you could've dropped me off back there!
Oh, don't be silly honey, we're happy to drive you right to the front door.
Yeah, this is an iconic moment in all of our lives, and I think we should experience it to the fullest.
Moira: We're very proud of you, Alexis.
Thank you.
Is that appropriate attire for high school, do you think?
- Yeah well, what's wrong with it?
!
- Well Well, now you're making me nervous!
Anyway, just don't trust anyone that wants to be your friend on the first day, okay?
And you mustn't let anyone push you around, I will not relive that bullying nightmare.
I wasn't bullied.
She doesn't mean you, Alexis.
Uh, it wasn't that bad.
That's the heartbreaking part, He was so blissfully unaware.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Ugh!
Okay, I think you're brave.
Well, that's very nice of you to say, David.
Okay, he's being sarcastic!
- David: What?
!
- Johnny: Oh.
It's a defense mechanism.
From all the bullying.
Oh my God!
General Store Aired the 21rst February   I can't tell what's more tragic, the fact that the only store in town is closing, or that they've decided to display fungal cream beside the cereal boxes.
That's actually really convenient, because I forgot to have breakfast, and I'm running low on fungal cream, so I don't wanna hear you say fungal again.
Fungal?
Yeah, it's like they knew what the consumer wanted, and then ran in the opposite direction.
- Finding everything okay?
- Yes.
Yeah.
It's sad about the store.
Thank you, it's been very hard.
Yeah, I can imagine.
Yeah, they just missed the mark, you know?
I mean, this store in the right hands could be very lucrative.
Uh huh, and by the right hands, you mean your hands?
Well, I mean someone with faultless taste who understands what people want and need, and if those happen to be my hands, then So why don't you do something about it?
I'm pretty sure telling them that they've driven their store into the ground might be rubbing salt in the wound.
No, I'm saying ever since you walked in here you've been talking about how you would've done things differently, so now's your chance.
Okay, your eyebrows never move, so I can't tell whether you're being serious or not.
I think you should put what little money you have where your mouth is.
I do have a very good idea.
What you lack in most things, you make up for in unsubstantiated confidence.
Okay, are we good to go?
!
Jocelyn: Good morning, class.
I'm sure you have all noticed there's a new student in our midst.
Let's give a warm welcome to Alexis Rose.
She is here until the end of the semester to finish her diploma.
Okay, so let's open our books.
Oh um, I'd just like to say a few words.
Okay, we're actually just running a little bit behind.
- Hey.
- Oh.
So as Jocelyn said, my name is Alexis, and yes, I did not finish high school.
Um, it's this long, boring story involving a yacht, and a famous soccer player, and like a ton of mushrooms.
Anyway, I think it would be so great if we could just go around the room, and everyone could tell me like, five things about yourself.
Jocelyn: Actually, we don't have time for that today.
Maybe you could talk between classes, or after school, or on the weekends.
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.
Okay.
So just find me after class, or Ivan: Good morning, Twyla.
Sorry I'm late, but I have morning muffins.
Oh, thanks, Ivan.
Yeah, they keep selling out.
Ivan!
- Bob's friend?
- Oh yeah!
Johnny Rose, remember?
Bagels, I know.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, bagels.
Oh, I see you have a new enterprise.
Yeah, it was always my dream to bake muffins.
Well, funny you should mention it, because I'm thinking of doing a continental breakfast at the motel, and this could be uh very helpful.
Yeah.
I not make breakfast.
No, no, no, a continental breakfast, just pastries and coffee.
No coffee.
Oh, I wouldn't expect you to make the coffee.
No, I make coffee, but only for myself.
Yeah, no, no, it's just your muffins that I'm interested in.
I bake for Twyla.
Oh, but it's always nice to have new customers.
Yes, yes, I think we should talk about this, Ivan.
Yeah, I'd love to see your operation.
Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, just come by place and I show you kitchen.
Yes.
Yeah.
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Good, yes.
- Ivan: Yes, see you.
- Twyla: Bye!
So long.
Wow, this could be very exciting.
You know, a continental breakfast could add an extra star on our rating.
Oh wow, so how many stars would that give you?
One.
Roland: So, there are carols playing, and it snows inside all day long.
Gwen's gonna lose her mind!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
What now?
!
No need to terminate your chitter-chatter on our accounts.
You gonna tell them, or should I?
Ladies, um we have some good news Christmas world!
Moving into town!
Bob, okay, there's a way to do these things, and I'm the one who's supposed to lead these meetings, - all right?
- They wanna take over - the general store.
- Bob!
I'm sorry!
It's just, you know, it's big news.
And what on earth is a Christmas World?
They sell Christmas stuff all year round.
But is this really the kind of business we want in this town?
You know, I have yet to find an ornament in there that I'd put on my tree, And I heard those little elves they have running around, they're actually underage kids.
Ladies, if we don't approve this, then Christmas World will take its fake snow, and its all-you-can-drink nog fountain to Elmdale!
Well, that makes our decision easy.
Oh, Moira!
Moira, Moira, Moira.
A word to the wise, okay?
You don't vote against Christmas.
It's huge business.
Tourist dollars!
Well, I'm not voting for it.
Moira: I'm inclined to side with Veronica on this.
All right, look guys, this is a big decision.
Let's take a little time to think about it.
It's-it's Christmas World!
We don't wanna get on their naughty list.
Ivan: Oh.
This is where I bake.
I have three ovens.
Is tradition in my family.
We make vatritza, burek, gibantsa and now I making uh, Danish, eclair, American-style toaster popping tart.
Wow, that sounds great, Ivan, but I was thinking cinnamon buns.
You know, the smell of cinnamon in the motel lobby, mmm!
Mr. Rose, for you, I can make anything.
- Great.
- Blueberry bun, butter tart, blueberry butter tart with raisin, blueberry butter tart with chips of chocolate Well, let's just stick with cinnamon buns for now, and if this works, we'll take it from there.
And I'm giving you special price.
Thank you.
Because you know Twyla.
Yes, I do.
I watch you make her laugh.
You watch me make her laugh?
- Mhmm.
- Oh, so you you like Twyla!
Oh, well, you should uh talk to her, I guess.
No, no, I can't.
I try, but when I speak, is like many, many muffin in my mouth.
You talk for me?
Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't be too comfortable doing that, no.
You just say nice thing.
I'll give you cinnamon bun for free.
You say, he's a good man, hard worker, never hurt no one.
Well, I wouldn't lead with that but uh no, no, I think this is better coming from you.
Hmm?
So, I have some news.
Oh David, I'm not sure I'm in the mood to hear about another sexual exploit.
I'm sorry, who is it this time?
I have actually been thinking about going back to work.
That's wonderful!
You've received an offer?
Um, it's more of a plan for an idea of a-a thing that I will be working at.
Well, that sounds less concrete, but full of promise, I'm sure.
I know you've been moping about the motel for some time now.
Mm, decompressing.
Um, and from that decompression came the idea to start my own business.
Hmm!
And just what is this exciting new venture?
I plan to submit a lease application for the general store.
Ha!
Oh!
Can you imagine?
Not seizing on this opportunity.
Well, I'll be investing some of the money I got from the Blouse Barn.
Mhmm, a bold decision.
Especially since the previous business has since gone under.
Dare I say, the space might be cursed?
Okay, the general store was a disaster.
And your plan is to raise it from the ashes?
Well, that's a risky move on the part of your investors.
I don't have any investors.
It's just me.
Just you?
I am doing this all on my own.
All on your own?
Yeah, I've actually given it a lot of thought.
You have?
You're the that's been telling me to get back to work!
- I did?
- Oh my God!
What, I'm simply asking questions!
No, you're not, you're just repeating random things that I've been saying!
Oh, far be it from me to stand in your way while you roll the dice with your hard-earned savings!
Thank you!
That's all you had to say.
The only people who buy silver trees are serial killers, and single men over 40, and my cousin, who is a single man over 40.
Oh, what a startling little tannenbaum.
To whom do we owe our reciprocity for this yuletide gift?
It says Christmas World right on it.
Oh, I see!
Sometimes the eyes won't allow the brain to see things at first.
Like the cultural and economic benefits of a seasonally specific store.
Okay, what did they send you?
Nothing, I assure you.
But when one considers the alternatives Moira, are you caving on this?
I'm just thinking out loud.
What if a young, independent business person were to step in?
I worry, one worries, you worry, are they too naive, or overly coddled, or emotionally precious to handle the rigor of establishing a business?
Look, I uh I don't wanna pressure anyone, but uh Gwen did tell me if I uh, I don't get Christmas World passed, I shouldn't come home.
I shouldn't I shouldn't come home.
Okay, let's put it to a vote.
Shall we?
All those in favor of Christmas World?
Hah!
Done!
Thank you, Moira!
It's Gwen.
The woman has a sixth sense.
Hi honey, are you sitting down?
Trust me, it's for the best.
It's happening!
It's really happening!
Jocelyn: So here's the thing about Marie Antoinette.
Even though I love to eat cake, I think I'd be pretty annoyed with her myself.
I do see your hand up Alexis, it's just that you probably haven't had a chance to catch up.
Okay, it's just that she never actually said "let them eat cake".
Um well, that depends on who you ask.
Hmm, well, I asked Kirsten Dunst, who played her in the movie.
Um, that line was actually written years before Marie Antoinette allegedly said it.
And um, Kirsten also told me at the premiere that she was jealous of my bangs.
Thank you for that contribution to the discussion, now My friends used to call me Marie, And that was mainly because I was casually seeing Prince Harry, so there was the whole like, is she gonna be a princess thing, um, but it's also because we were going through this very dark phase where we were just like, partying too hard.
Jocelyn: Thank you for your enthusiasm, it's just that we have a lot to cover here.
Girls?
What did I say about passing notes in class?
I'll see you both after school.
You know who else passed notes?
This lady passed a lot of secret notes, and eventually was killed.
Oh hi, how are you?
- Very busy.
- How am I?
!
Terrific!
Aside from the fact that I caught wind that Christmas World was moving into the general store.
Just when I thought that the taste levels in this town were already scraping the bottom of the barrel.
Oh!
Tell me about it.
Hmm So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that the deciding factor in all of this was my own mother!
It seems extremely off brand to support a disgusting big box store like that.
David, sit, please.
I know you think what I did was cruel, but I was just protecting you.
And I'd say you'll understand one day, but you don't enjoy children, so perhaps you won't.
Okay, protect me from what?
From yourself.
Your father and I have not prepared you for an undertaking of this scope!
Okay, what about all the galleries?
Those were all me.
I've run businesses before.
Never on your own, and never without a safety net.
I don't know how many times I have to thank you for the start-up money!
But I opened those galleries myself.
And who do you think bought all that art, and sold out all your shows?
Uh, my patrons.
And who do you think bought all your patrons?
So you're telling me that my entire professional career was a sham?
!
We helped you because we could!
And now I realize that might not have been the best thing for you or your autonomy, but Okay, well, now I guess I'll never find out if I could've succeeded on my own.
David!
Ivan: Hello, Mr. Rose.
Cinnamon buns for you.
Oh Ivan, thank you.
Ohh!
These smell amazing!
And I have muffins for Twyla.
- Oh.
- Yeah, I'm going to talk to her now.
- Good luck.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Ivan.
- Um Here's the muffins.
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.
Wow!
Mr. Rose, I blow it.
Oh, well, there's always tomorrow, Ivan.
No, no, don't All right, have a seat.
I always watch romantic movies.
"Got Mail," "When Harry Met Sally," "Smell of Woman".
Yeah, Ivan, you don't want to be over-preparing.
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.
- What can I get you?
- I'm good man.
Okay, and?
I'll have the waffles.
And uh, eggs, uh, uh, what does dog say before the breakfast?
Bun appetite.
Bun appetite.
Bun Bone appetit, I think it's a dog bone joke.
Bun appetite.
- Eggs and waffles.
- Hmm, yes.
Coming up.
- Yeah.
- I know.
Oh, well I think uh a little quality control on this - wouldn't hurt, huh?
- Yeah, yes.
Hey, I think that we started out on the wrong foot.
And like, I totally get it, there's a new girl in town, and that can be super intimidating, but I just wanted to let you know that I'm actually very approachable.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So why don't you just show me what that note says.
Girls, passing notes in class is not only disruptive - to the whole student body - I started it.
I passed the note to Steph M. And Becky.
Alexis, if you're gonna be in this class, you are gonna have to learn to be less disruptive.
Now let's see what was so important.
That really isn't necessary, Mrs. Schitt.
"Alexis is too pretty, and everyone's talking about the dress.
So gorge".
Okay, I love that you're so confident, Mhmm.
It's just that we're going to have to focus a little less on ourselves, and a little more on the material.
Totally.
Okay.
I stole this dress from Ashlee Simpson.
Or like, she stole it from me, and then I stole it back.
Do you wanna have lunch tomorrow?
Sure.
I just find it extremely violating.
Because your parents threw money at you?
Yes!
They paid for everything, it's like a form of child abuse.
Don't quote me on this, but it seems like their intentions were good.
I mean, they didn't buy all the good reviews your galleries got.
Who's to say?
!
Yeah, I mean, they do give me a small weekly stipend for hanging out with you, so Ugh!
David, there you are.
I come bearing good news.
And what's that, your friends at Christmas World are looking for a deeply embittered, mildly Hebraic-looking elf?
!
I thought you might like to know that council has agreed to accept your application.
What about Christmas World?
I had a very effective strategy to change everyone's minds, that I ultimately didn't get to use, because Christmas World pulled out.
This is good news!
I mean, yeah, if someone hadn't snuffed out the last remaining embers of my self-confidence.
Why don't you channel some of that charming self-pity into a business plan, okay?
Because the lease is yours, David, if you still want it.
Which he does.
If there's anyone in this town who might have the eye to create something truly beautiful, it's you, David.
And me, but in this case, you.
Okay.
I will submit my application.
There's cinnamon buns in the lobby!
These are good.
I know, where are these from?
Yeah, I got those for the motel.
They're supposed to be for the guests!
Okay, well, they were just sitting there.
Oh, they weren't just sitting there, Alexis, they're the product of a lot of hard work!
Moira: John?
In here, Moira.
There are cinnamon buns in the lobby!
Oh come on, Moira, Moira!
These are for the continental breakfast we're offering at the motel!
Continental breakfast?
- They're for the guests!
- How whimsical.
It's a start, it's a start, it's a big step.
What exactly goes into a "continental breakfast"?
It's a breakfast, David, it's a light breakfast with pastries and coffee.
What's continental about that?
It's for business travelers, travelling the continent, eating breakfast, and continental travelling.
That doesn't sound even remotely correct.
Well, it's European, Moira, so Okay, come on, seriously!
There's only one left?
!
I know, Stevie was eating the other one.
Here, why don't you have this, and I'll take the big one.
It's all right, I'll take care of it.
Well, I guess it would be wrong to serve the guests day-olds.
You know this bun added a star to our rating?
How many did we have before?
Not the point!
LittleDuck
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1  Johnny: Listen, I've gotta step out for a bit, I told Stevie if she needed any help Well, where are you off to?
To pick up the motel coasters.
Oh, you were serious.
Yeah, custom coasters are a very effective marketing tool.
Says who?
!
The guy who invented custom beer cozies?
- Coasters work.
- Yes, the last thing we want to do is stain these exquisite table tops.
Moira, you're having a drink, you glance down at your coaster, it says, "tweet us on Facebook"!
Or uh, "leave us a review"!
And you say, yeah, yeah, okay, I think I will.
Is that what it says?
Yes David, that's what it says, you're not the only one with an online presence.
- No, no - Well, aren't you Mr. Futuristic!
Listen, we had samples made.
Take a look.
There's no address on this.
Oh, wow!
Aren't we stuck in the Dark Ages.
Huh?
Let me break it down for you, junior.
If they're at the motel using the coasters, they don't need to know where the motel is.
Um, I was referring to a web address.
Or a Twitter handle.
Oh.
Hmm, that might be something you'd wanna put on there.
Or a Facebook page.
All right, let me write this down.
Or a hashtag.
A hashtag?
Is that two words?
No, it's not.
Hi, sorry to bother you.
I'm afraid Mr. Rose has just stepped out, He's gone to get coasters.
Yeah, wait, he said that you might be available to help.
- Did he?
!
- It's just that we have um, a bunch of guests checking in, and I could really use some help.
- Now!
- Now?
Well then, I am here for you, Stevie.
Uh, let's see something in a supervisory capacity, perhaps?
Then you can work the front desk.
Ooh, receptionist work is not my strong suit, that's more Alexis' bailiwick.
The other option is changing the sheets, and mattress covers.
Then I shall keep watch over this front desk.
Jocelyn: Okay, I'll see you after lunch.
Alexis, do you mind sticking around for a minute?
Okay.
I'm assuming that you know why I wanna talk to you today?
Is it because I was texting in class?
Uh, nope.
I wanna talk about your paper.
There are parts of this that sound like they've been written by someone else.
- Oh my God, thank you!
- No, no, no.
I'm saying that I think it's plagiarized.
Are you sure you wrote this yourself?
Trust me, if I could've gotten someone else to write this, I would've.
I definitely wrote this.
Okay, there are just parts of this that make me think that's not true.
For example, "we should begin by scrutinizing the duplicitousness of such businesses, whose practices, or lack thereof, can only be described as untoward".
Duplicitousness?
!
I can barely say that.
And untoward?
Okay, yeah, no, I did not write this.
Can I see?
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
Can you just look?
Can eyes, eyes!
Hi.
You're gonna write a new paper, and I am gonna grade that one instead.
Otherwise it's a fail.
Okay, like, I didn't even choose this font!
It's horrible.
Okay, look at her.
But don't really look at her, look at me.
Look at her, and look at me.
Oh, that's good, that's good, closer.
Closer.
Yeah, we had an appointment this morning.
Okay, here we go, one, two oh, that was good.
Uh remind me, are you here for a photo series, or travel planning, or our newest service, closet organization?
Um, I'm here to file my incorporation papers for my business.
Oh, that's right.
Patrick!
Uh, B13.
Ah, this is for you.
- Patrick.
- David.
David Rose, you bought the General Store.
Leased.
Leased the General Store, yeah.
- That's a big deal.
- Is it?
Yeah, it's pretty big.
Yeah, you wanna have a seat?
Ray: Your parents tell me you're very sporty, so Will, why don't you grab the paddle, and Theresa, a badminton racket?
So, why don't we start with the name of the business?
Oh um, I'm oscillating between two names at the moment, so if we could just leave that one blank, - that would be great.
- Sure, sure.
Give you more time to oscillate.
Um, business address?
Okay, so I'm working on that.
Um, I'm currently staying in a motel, and I think it might be confusing if I gave you the address to another business.
Y-Yeah, for sure.
We'll leave that blank as well.
Battin' a thousand here, David.
- I don't know what that means.
-  Hey, here's an easy one.
A brief description of the business.
Um well, it's-um, it's a General Store, but it's also a very specific store.
- Huh.
- And it's also not just a store, it's like a place where people can come and get coffee, um, or drinks, but it's not a coffee shop, nor is it a bar.
Okay, so we're pretty clear on what it's not.
Yeah, it's an environment.
Um And yes, we will be selling things, but it's more like more like a branded immersive experience.
Right, I love the buzzwords, David, but I do need to put something down here.
Okay, you couldn't use anything I just said?
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you take these home with you, and just fill them out when you have a a clearer idea of what you want to do with your business.
Okay, um I do have a clear idea.
Oh!
You've settled on a name, then?
Um you're either very impatient, or extremely sure of yourself.
I threw you a bit of a change-up there, huh?
Yeah, again, I don't know what that means, I don't play cricket.
Look, take this, it's my card, and I feel like you will need it.
Uh, you know what, I think I'm good.
Um, so thank you for this.
It's nice to meet you, David.
Yeah.
Ray: Okay Teresa, remember to breathe!
I'd like to check in, please.
Oh my God, where did you come from?
I said hello twice.
Well, hello, hello, then.
Here you go, room three.
Uh, don't you need my credit card?
My associates will deal with all that when you depart.
Also, how many beds are in the room?
Two.
Would it be possible to get a cot, or a roll away bed put in the room?
Oh, you're expecting company?
No, I use it to lay out my clothes.
The chest of drawers should suffice, no?
I like to see all my clothes at once.
Might the other bed not do?
Yes Except I haven't decided which bed to sleep in, so that's tricky.
Really, the cot would be best.
- A cot it is, then.
- Thank you.
Oh, and are the pillows feather, or foam?
- Yes.
- Sorry, which one?
- I don't care.
- I'm sorry?
I don't know!
I'm not entirely versed on the contents of the motel's pillow collection.
I was just asking.
And I'm very much looking forward to the moment when that stops!
- Well!
- Enjoy your stay.
Johnny: Oh hi, honey!
How was school?
Um, not great.
Jocelyn failed my economics paper.
What?
!
You worked so hard on that!
Yeah, which is why it was super upsetting when she said it wasn't good.
- She what?
- Yeah, she said it was bad.
No, sorry, um "poorly written, and under-researched".
Well, that's just not true!
Well, you have to go back and tell Jocelyn that information was founded on practical experience in the field!
It should've been founded on my research.
Oh, well yes, I'm sure Well, your research was all over it.
Dad, what did you do to my paper?
!
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything with your paper.
Your laptop was open, I did a little editing, nothing major.
I've been accused of plagiarism!
- What?
- Yeah!
Jocelyn thought I cheated because "someone" used words like duplexity, and backtowards!
- Untoward.
- Whatever!
And now I have to do the whole thing again, when my original paper was totally fine!
Well, it wasn't totally fine, honey.
There was questionable grammar, and a few spelling mistakes, and I mean - Dad!
- All right, I'll back off.
Thank you!
Just out of curiosity, did she happen to say anything about that quote from Lee lacocca?
That's for you.
- Those are the clean sheets.
- No, I know.
Um, so I went to incorporate earlier today, and some guy basically told me that my business was a failure.
- What?
!
- Yeah!
- Who told you that?
- Some guy who's working at Ray's.
Some guy who's working at Ray's told you your business was a failure?
Basically, yeah.
Oh well, what did he say?
He told me to come back to him once I had a clearer idea of what my business was.
And then he told you it was a failure?
Well no, not like Not exactly.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying to figure out when he called your business a failure.
Okay, maybe he didn't call my business a failure, - but it was insinuated.
- Okay.
So you know that I think your business is a good idea, and you know that I mean that, because I'm incapable of faking sincerity.
I'm also just incapable of sincerity in general.
Okay, you know what, I'm going through it right now, and I actually think that I might've been the one that insinuated that my business was a failure.
Wait, you blew something out of proportion?
No, what if he's right?
I am sitting on a big, empty space, and I couldn't even tell him what I wanted to do with it!
- You're freaking out.
- Uh Because you know what you wanna do with your business, you have walked me through it one too many times.
So he was probably just trying to help.
No, I mean, he was very snippy.
Okay, um I found this under the bed in room two, so do you wanna take a break?
That's disgusting!
Uh, and yes.
Yeah.
Hi David, it's Patrick.
I um-was just calling to run my business plan uh, by you in a little more detail.
So feel free to give me a call back, and I will be happy to walk you through it.
Okay, ciao.
Ciao!
I said ciao to that person.
Hi Patrick, Yeah, I think I I think I called you David.
Which that's not - that's not your name.
You can just delete that text, the-the voice-mail that I left you.
Um, just thought it might be a good idea to give you some background information about the-the store.
It's basically a General Store.
Um, that will support local artists under the brand of the store, which-which would also be my brand-oh.
Sorry, I just got a text.
Oh God!
Yeah, the text cut us off.
Oh my god!
Well, at least I finished my book.
Moira, what happened this morning?
John, you'd be so proud of me.
I manned that front desk with the vigor of a wartime radio operator.
Really?
!
I checked in one whole guest.
Answered his questions, and believe me, it was a laundry list!
I see, and is there any chance you might've been a little brisk with this guest?
Not in the slightest.
It was a master class in patience.
Moira, I just got an alert, that someone has posted a terrible review of this motel.
Oh no, John!
Well dear, if I've learned anything from the theater, it's whatever they say, you cannot take it personally.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is not about me.
"I was served by an intimidating woman at the front desk, with an unrecognizable accent, and scary-looking attire".
And what might this have to do with me?
- Moira?
- Oh, that fussy little !
After niggling me with relentless demands!
It doesn't matter!
Our job is to welcome people, to make them feel at home!
I did!
John, do you know a better hostess?
You're gonna have to talk to him!
- Apologize!
- You can't be serious!
Moira, one bad review could sink this motel!
We had four good reviews, and this just brought down the whole average!
Okay, John.
For you I will talk to that odious little man, and set things straight.
- Good.
- But unlike him, I will not hide behind the internet!
Hi.
Um So I messed up my form.
And I'm going to need another form from you.
Oh, okay.
What?
Nothing, I'm just uh, I'm so glad you made such good use of my business card.
I'm sorry I didn't pick up, I was at a thing.
Well, best you didn't.
But I got all your messages.
Ah, um, and just listened to the first one, and then erased the rest?
- No, no, no, no.
- No?
No, I listened to all of them, I kinda had to, to piece them together.
Actually, I played them for a few friends of mine, I was at a birthday party, so there were a lot of people weighing in.
Okay, um Just kidding, I didn't play them for anybody.
I thought the first few were very humorous, David, and then I lost interest.
I may have played them here on speaker phone.
Okay.
Can I just get the paperwork, and then I can You know, the good thing about the messages was that I was able to get enough information to fill out your forms.
Oh.
I wish I could remember.
It's a good idea, your business.
Re-branding local products and crafts, it's very inventive.
- Thanks.
- And I like the name.
"Rose Apothecary," you know, it's just pretentious enough.
Would we call that pretentious, or timeless?
So I'll call you when I hear something.
And hey, if I don't get a hold of you, I'll just uh, leave a message.
Okay, thanks.
Ciao!
Hard at it, huh?
Mhmm.
You know honey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for interfering, I was only trying to help.
Why couldn't you have helped me cheat in private school, like everyone else's parents?
!
Because I wasn't around to help you cheat back then, and I regret it!
The not being around, I mean.
And I think that's part of the reason I wanted to help you cheat this time.
Although I don't really consider it cheating.
Mmm.
okay, well, it is.
It is, but is it really plagiarism to take something your dad wrote, and put it in your paper, and claim it as your own?
Yes, that's exactly what it is.
Well I'm sorry.
And I may have underestimated you before, but that is certainly not the case now.
Thank you.
And you know why, honey?
Because you're better "than" that.
Thank you.
N-No, you're better "than" that.
Okay, I'm better then that.
Not better then that, better than that.
Okay, I don't know what you're talking about right now!
All right, well if you don't want my help, "than" I guess I'll leave.
Okay, thank you!
Okay, I'll see you later "than".
Bye!
Ugh!
Hi.
The drinks out of this machine are very cold.
- Oh, good.
- Too cold.
When I hold them, they sting my hands.
We'll have to find you some mittens.
I'm quite prone to frostbite.
I know you wrote that review.
It's my responsibility to relate my experience - to other customers.
- Is it?
I didn't even mention that the hot water runs brown for three seconds.
All right, I'll agree, this motel could use some improvements.
But your review will scare off the guests we need to afford those improvements.
I was just being honest.
I see.
Then I suppose I should be honest.
My daughter married a man who turned out to be her uncle.
I'm sorry?
The lowlife uncle she believed to have been executed years before by the Indian cartel.
This is all on my ex-husband's side, I'm good people, and so's my daughter.
She had nothing to do with Raven's accident.
When the Bangalores finally found Dagger, and gave him what he deserved, they threatened to burn down the motel, and leave my pregnant baby penniless.
This motel?
She begged them to let her keep this place, and she promised them a cut of the profits in return.
They laughed, and left, but not without first shaving all her beautiful hair!
When people ask me, why do you work here for nothing?
I tell them, this is my flesh and blood!
I do this for her!
Nothing!
She is my everything!
Okay, wow, I had no idea.
I can take down that review.
- Oh, I - I'll take it down.
Oh, do what you must.
Good morning, Roses.
I just wanted to pop by to congratulate Alexis on her economics paper.
Johnny: Oh honey, that's great news!
Our little woman of academia!
David: I would love to read this economics paper.
I will admit that your thesis of "why shop in store when you can buy online" was a little off-topic, but still a really fresh take.
Thank you.
Well, look at you, Alexis, acing your paper!
Oh, no, no, God no.
I gave her a solid C plus.
Oh, so she did write it herself.
It was a noticeable improvement over the first paper.
Um well, I should hope so!
Well, m-maybe not a noticeable improvement, but um, a different improvement.
No, no, this one was definitely better.
Because no one helped her write it.
Enjoy your breakfast.
David: Mm!
Have you seen Dad's coasters?
"Follow us on tweeters"!
Tweeters!
We're going to get lots of disciples, dear.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 John, do you have the car keys?
Do I have the car keys?
No.
No.
But according to the sign-out sheet, I was the last person to use the car.
Well, that's not very helpful, John.
You're the only one using the sign-out sheet.
Well, that's not true.
Stevie's got her name on the sheet.
Wait a minute, why is Stevies name on the sheet?
She's got her own car.
David!
Do you know where the car keys are?
Yeah, I have them.
Oh, well, then why isn't your name on the sign-out sheet.
Because you're the only one using that sign-out sheet.
David, I need the car keys, your father is driving me to Thornbridge.
I'm driving you to Thornbridge?
To that municipalities conference.
Yes.
I thought Roland offered to drive you.
Oh, he did.
But no thanks.
I can't take four hours in the truck with Roland and Lynyrd Skynyrd.
Okay, Alexis and I need the car, we're running some errands for the store today.
Um, since when?
Uh, since I need help for a pick-up.
And mom clearly already has a lift, and I'm pretty sure parents are supposed to put their children before themselves.
Oh really?
No.
If airplane safety videos have taught me anything, David, it's that a mother puts her on own mask on first.
Ah, see, and that's precisely why we have the sign-out sheet.
For this kind of dispute.
Okay.
Fine.
Now my name is on the list.
And there's a sheep farm that's expecting us in 20 minutes for a pick-up of wool throws.
No, no, no.
No, no.
Your mother already expressed a verbal intention to use the car.
Okay, we're gonna have the car back in a few hours.
Okay.
Well, I might need it for a few hours after that though.
Fine, we'll just keep it for the day.
John!
You people are abusing the system.
It's not a difficult system.
Moira, look at this.
Under purpose of trip he writes "driving".
Whoa, hold it right there.
I want to see the look on your face when you walk into your first regional association of municipalities conference.
And there it is.
Ah, name tags.
Let's get suited up.
Thank you but no, Roland.
I won't wear anything with an adhesive backing.
Ah-ha.
Oh, hey, Moira, look over there.
You see that guy over there?
The well dressed one?
That's Gavin Mccrae.
Mayor of Thornbridge.
Hm.
You mean the one serving drinks to the other people?
Okay.
Maybe he's the other guy over there.
Also very well dressed.
Well, now you've identified the catering staff.
Moira please, this is RAMC.
These are the people with their fingers on the button of everything from road salting to quarry inspection to - water tower repair.
- Hmm.
I mean, it's really kinda scary that we're all in here under one roof.
Oh, it's frightening.
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna need you in there, by my side when we make this budget pitch.
You don't have to worry about me, Roland.
If there is anyone at this fabulous little confab who know how to work a room of fragile egos, it's me.
I once hosted the non-televised portion of the People Choice Awards.
This is a actually a great idea, David.
Consolidating all of your products under one label instills brand recognition and create synergy.
Um, I'm sure you're very excited about all the new words you're learning in your high school intro to business course, but I think a more effective use of your time right now, would be to go and get the hand cream that I asked you to get ten minutes ago.
I got the hand cream.
Yeah.
The box of hand cream.
I asked you to get the box of hand cream, not sample the hand cream.
That's like 53 pounds.
Why are you here?
You know what I think would be really cute is if I had my own little label, like, under your label.
- Yeah - And I can sell festival wear, and I can sell like hair feathers and body jewelry David.
Wow, things are really coming together in here.
Oh, um, we're actually not open yet.
But that's so sweet.
Thank you.
We've been working very hard.
Well, I'm actually not here to shop.
I'm-I'm Patrick.
I'm just dropping off David's business license.
Oh, isn't that just the cutest thing.
Um, David's in the back.
But I am Alexis, And I'm currently studding business And I'm David's sister and life coach so.
Well, it's great to meet you, Alexis.
Uh, I'm sorry if my hands are too soft.
I've just been sampling a lot of product.
So really soft.
They are.
Reporter: Excuse me, Mrs. Rose, if I may, just a couple of questions.
Were you surprised to secure such a big funding boost for the municipalities?
That was quite the speech.
Oh Thank you.
Thank you.
What did I do?
Well, I was simply channeled someone who cares, but if you insist on referring to me as the linchpin.
I'll take that.
That's right.
We're We're just a couple linchpins here.
I'm Roland Schitt, Moira's boss Yes, I'll I'm the ingenue here.
A total babe in the political woods.
That's true.
You know, this is her first RAMC.
But I think under my wing, she's-she's learning to fly.
- I've been mayor for ten years - Thank you.
And I did Okay, we'll talk when you have more time do There she is!
The woman of the hour!
Oh my God, now they're crowning me with titles.
Join us for drinks in the diamond club.
In the diamond club?
Hm.
That sounds grand.
It's the hotel bar.
They have a special RAMC cocktail.
It's a sparkling white Russian.
The trick is to get it down before it curdles.
As appealing as you make that sounds, Roland, I think I'll just go to my room.
Oh, come on!
Look, I never get this kind of I mean, our town doesn't get recognized like this very often and this time it's for something really positive.
Okay.
One drink.
This means a lot to you, doesn't it?
Yes, and to you.
Moira!
Moira!
Moira!
- Isn't it so soft?
- It is.
Whoa, might be tying it a little too tight there.
Uh, that is actually cat hair.
There's a Himalayan breeder up the street that knits them for us.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm just dropping off your business license.
And activating my allergies.
Oh, In that case you should probably take that off.
- Yeah.
Like now!
- Oh.
Oh!
Isn't that the sweet thing, that he framed it.
Um.
It is very sweet.
Thank you, Patrick.
Actually, they they all come framed.
Okay, thank God.
Because I was just thinking that this frame is a little too corporate for my brand.
David, I was just about to sample the unisex Mennonite cologne on Patrick.
Um, that's not a sample.
And you've sampled half the store at this point.
So we need to sell all this stuff.
Okay, well I flattened out the lip balm.
So no one's gonna notice.
There's a lot of stuff in here, David.
You don't wanna spend too much money up front.
Yeah, that's not good, David.
You have to be prepared to survive a year without making any profit.
Actually, the textbooks now say eighteen months.
Well, what are the textbooks saying about curating a selection of products from local vendors and selling them on consignment in a one-stop-shop retail environment, that benefits the vendor and the customer?
Well, I don't have my textbook on me.
I stand corrected.
Listen, if you need help, I-I'm happy to help.
Why?
Alexis is here helping.
Well, no.
If Patrick has offered to move all the boxes, then I think we should let him.
Is that what I offered?
Okay, well, thank you, Patrick.
You're welcome.
Um, Okay.
So you can start by moving all of those big things of hand cream.
What?
Moira:  It's all so unbelievable, John!
I had forgotten what it was like to be feted.
Moira?
What?
!
I can, I can hardly hear you, John!
The cheering and accolades are drowning out your gentle voice.
Oh, I take it things went well?
I'm a game-changer, Jo Hey oh!
Uh Oh, Gavin's brought out the hard stuff.
So darling, I must sign off.
All right, well, have fun, sweetheart, and don't get too carried away.
I'm networking, John!
Do you know that I'm actually good at this!
Who are you talking to?
It's my husband!
Was that for me?
Why am I-why am I getting booed?
- That's Wait!
- That's my man, Johnny!
Hey Johnny, it's Roland!
Hey, we're all here at RAMC!
You should be here, Mary-something is here Gavin is here The road salt guy Yeah.
Okay, Roland.
Good.
I'm having a bit of a night myself here.
Come on!
Stop, I have to talk to my husband.
John.
John.
Moira, you know, it might be time for a coffee.
And I'm gonna let you go now.
And have fun, sweetheart.
We'll see you in the morning.
Goodbye, phone call!
Goodbye, my darling.
All right.
Goodnight, sweetheart.
Oh, Moira, by the way, I just picked up the new    Okay.
John, shut the blinds.
Johnny, please.
- Moira?
- Hm?
-  Oh - Oh Roland!
What are you doing in my room?
What are you talking about?
This is my room.
Well, what the  are you doing in your room?
Well, I was trying to sleep.
Until you started pounding on the door, telling me to whip up a salmon plate.
I finally let you in, you flaked out on the bed.
Oh my God.
Are you naked under there?
Honey, what I do in the privacy of my sheets is my own business.
Oh, no.
No God, no.
Oh, God, no.
- No, dear God.
- Welcome to RAMC.
Oh, my God No!
Jocelyn!
Almost didn't recognize you over there.
Hey Johnny.
It's been a morning, but I don't have to tell you that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You've had a tough morning?
You're handling this way better than I am.
Handling what better?
Roland and Moira, sleeping together.
What?
!
At the conference last night.
Yeah.
No, no!
Let's just go back to that previous sentence.
Ah, when you say they slept together Well, Roland says that they just slept - in the same bed together.
- Ah-ha.
And he says that nothing happened, so I'm just trying to, you know, process all of this.
Oh yes.
Well Aren't we all.
I mean, I'm-I'm hearing about this for the first time.
Moira didn't tell you?
You know, we chatted this morning about how successful the night was, but sleeping with your husband didn't really come up as one of the reasons the night was so successful.
And we probably shouldn't read anything into the fact that for some reason, Moira decided to hide this from you.
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't say "hide".
No, no.
Because Moira was so exhausted when she got in this morning.
Maybe she was exhausted because she was up all night - with her mitts all over - No!
No.
No!
No.
I know Moira and she would never in a million years ever sleep with Anyone.
Else.
It's just that I know what it's like to be in bed with a naked Roland Schitt, and I am powerless against that.
He was naked?
He sleeps naked every night.
Do you wanna order some thing to put chocolate sauce on?
No.
Um, David, I can swing by the store and help out after school, if you want.
I also may need more of that lip balm that I liked.
Okay.
Um, I think we've had enough of your help.
And unless you planning on purchasing that lip balm you're won't be getting the lip balm.
Okay.
It's called sweat equity, David.
I learned about this week.
And that's when you help someone out and then they give you lip balm or whatever else you might need in exchange for your time and energy.
I think you might actually need to break a sweat, in order to earn sweat equity.
Okay, what if I got Patrick to break a sweat for me.
That's called outsourcing, outsourcing Are you passing this economics course?
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes, I'm pretty sure.
Okay.
Um, if you really want the lip balm that bad there are a few things around the store that I could use your help with.
Just an FYI, Patrick won't be there.
So there won't be anybody for you to flirtatiously boss around.
Okay, I hate to break this to you, David, but there will always be somebody for me to flirtatiously boss around.
So what was going on there?
Oh, nothing.
He hasn't even asked for my phone number, which in my experience, means he's either newly married or he's gay.
Okay So like if you're sensing a vibe or something, maybe that means that his eye for somebody else He's a business major who wears straight leg, mid-range denim.
He's not into me.
Okay, well it's either that or he's really into your store, which no offense seems a lot less likely to me.
Okay.
I think you missed a spot on that page with the highlighter.
Where?
Hello, Moira.
Hello there, love of my life!
Funny thing.
I just ran into Jocelyn.
Oh.
How is Jocelyn?
Oh, she was a little upset.
Apparently her husband, Roland, spent the night with you.
I know, wasn't that funny?
Moira!
When were you gonna tell me about this?
Ah, we talked about it this morning, John!
We laughed about it.
We didn't laugh about it.
Because we didn't talk about it.
I would have remembered if you had said something that funny.
It's inconsequential, John Just let it go.
I have.
May I ask what you are doing?
Oh, I've decided to cut down on my drinking.
Unrelated, I assume?
To what?
To you sleeping with Roland last night.
Okay.
This joke has played itself out.
It was humorous this morning.
We didn't talk about it this morning!
Obviously.
I didn't tell you anything because I was embarrassed.
I was riding high, John, apparently really high, After winning what some people called a landmark victory for this and many other towns.
Then I woke up in the last place I'd ever wanted to be.
Well, can't say I'm not glad to hear you say that.
Oh John, I owe an apology to you.
And to sober people everywhere.
Well, I knew it was nothing happened, Moira, it's Just I was getting a feeling you weren't taking this very seriously.
If I weren't, John, would I be pouring this out.
Moira, that's my beer!
You don't even drink beer!
It's symbolic, John.
Oh-oh.
I take it you're here to tell me that my business license has been revoked.
No, no.
You're all good.
Okay.
Um My sister isn't, isn't here so I'm not here for your sister.
Okay.
You know I've been thinking about all this and these products that Alexis was showing me yesterday were actually really impressive, I mean the whole model is actually very sustainable Thank you.
But I think you're gonna need more start-up money.
Oh.
More start-up money.
- Hm.
- Um And where do you think I'll get that money?
Well, when you're supporting local business, there are grants that you can apply for.
And I would be happy to assist you with those applications.
Well, that is very um very generous.
Well, I wouldn't be doing it for free.
See, if these grants came through, you'd have the money to start paying me.
Okay.
Um I really think you have something here, David.
You just, you just need some help.
You need a lot of help Okay.
Um Well, uh, then yes I am open to entertaining your investment offer.
Great.
And in the interest of us potentially working together I did want to come clean about something.
Okay.
I um I actually picked out that frame.
I see.
So thank you for making it very clear that I will be making the creative decisions for the store.
Um, and I guess you can handle all the business stuff.
I'm very comfortable with that.
Okay.
Um, and you do know that if the grant money doesn't come through, then I won't Oh, I'm gonna get the money.
Okay.
- Hello, Johnny.
- Roland.
Johnny, me and six of my closest friends were hoping we could have a little chat.
Well, it's awfully late.
Johnny, I'm talking about the beer.
No, I know, I know, you're talking about the beer.
It's just that Moira's in the shower.
She's been showering most of the day, actually.
Good, because I think it's best that we talk man-to-man.
Ahh  Jocelyn and I spoke, and she told me you're still pretty upset, huh?
Look, if anyone was upset it was Jocelyn.
I was just upset because Jocelyn was upset.
All right, pal.
Well, I'm here to put your mind at ease, okay?
I am 99.999% sure that nothing happened between me and your wife.
I'm 100% sure and I wasn't even there!
Well, I sure was.
All of me.
You know, I spent 35 minutes this morning inspecting every inch of my body for bite marks, back scratches, lipstick prints.
And I couldn't find anything.
Well, there was this one thing on the bottom of my foot, but I think that may have been there before.
I really don't know.
You know what, Roland, I think I'm gonna ask you to leave.
Because Moira's coming out soon and I really don't want to tempt fate twice.
I got it.
No, no.
I don't think you do got it.
And not to put too fine a point on it, Roland, but my wife would never go out for a burger when she has a strong penchant for steak.
- Good night, Roland.
- Breakfast tomorrow, right?
- Good night, Roland.
- Okay.
Don't worry it's only me.
Ha ha, very droll, Mr. Rose.
Thought I'd announce myself just in case you were expecting somebody else.
Is living with that blackout not punishment enough?
You know I meant to ask, Moira, what were the amenities like in that hotel room?
High-pressured water, down pillows?
I'll never know.
I had my one chance at a proletarian oasis and I squandered it, passed out Roland a bed.
You slept with Roland?
No, she-she didn't.
She found herself in his bed.
- Mom slept with Roland?
- Yes.
Apparently.
I will not be tried and condemned by the likes of you two.
- So what's gonna happen now?
- Yeah.
Is there gonna be like a custody battle over us?
David, stop.
We gonna have to like spend weekends over at Roland's now, or?
Goodnight, Alexis.
Do we call him uncle Roland?
All right, that is enough, David.
No.
I mean, I get it, Roland is the mayor, and it's very difficult to work with someone who you're attracted to.
Yeah.
Like you and Ted?
No!
I'm making fun of mom and dad right now, David.
And we're done.
Back to your room.
Um, I just want you to know that no matter what anyone says, you will always be our first dad.
- Good night.
- Okay.
I want to see how
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Family!
I have exciting news!
Oh Good.
David, I hoped you were home.
Thanks.
You're aware of the extraordinary work of New York-Based photographer Sebastien Raine?
You mean my ex?
When did you date Sebastien Raine?
They dated for like a month and a half and David got very upset about it.
Okay, It was almost three months.
Four, if you include the month that he was seeing other people.
And you met him through me.
That's nonsense.
I met Sebastien Raine at an art opening years ago.
At my gallery.
And can you please stop saying his full name.
He's a monster, who uses people, - and leaves them for dead.
- Yeah.
I hate to play contrarian, David, but The Times and I, both consider Sebastien Raine a dear friend.
Remember when he dumped you?
And you ate all those mall pretzels, and watched "Bridget Jones's Diary" every day for a year.
It wasn't a whole year, And I will not feel shame about the mall pretzels.
Okay, that's enough news for today.
Ummm no, what about him?
He's coming here.
What?
Wha Why?
Sebastien Raine wants to collaborate on a project.
With me.
And you know his commitment to his work.
He's willing to come all the way here.
When flying me to New York would be a lot easier.
And a welcome escape.
But Sebastien Raine puts his subjects first.
And he told me I must respect that.
Okay.
You know what?
I don't care.
So you can do whatever you like.
I could cancel, but you just told me you don't care so now I have no choice but to meet him.
I think he's coming.
So could you please go to the window and check for me?
- Who's he?
- Uh, Sebastien Raine.
He's most likely wearing a very expensive sweater, that doesn't look very expensive.
Is he like, really Really handsome in a homeless-y way sort of way?
Yes.
Yup.
Then he is coming here.
Oh, he is?
Okay.
- He's walking.
- He's walking.
- He's walking towards here.
- Where is he walking to?
- And now he's coming in - Now he's coming in - and so he's here.
-  He's here.
All right.
David.
- Oh - Wow.
This is exactly how I pictured it.
Sebastien.
Ah You're-you're here.
I thought you were supposed to be with my mother.
So good to see you.
Look at you You look really Healthy.
Thanks.
I can't believe this is where you live.
I think you're brave.
Hi.
Stevie.
I like your sweater.
You must be David's girlfriend.
- No - No, I own The Motel, so that makes me more like your landlord?
No.
It doesn't.
Stevie, Stevie.
Stevie.
I'd love to Polaroid you naked one day.
Okay.
Okay?
!
David, I'm thinking maybe I'll stay the night, so I hope we can, you know catch up.
Yeah, I'm super busy these days Yeah, I just feel like we have unfinished business, you and I. Room five is available.
Room five sounds great.
So brave.
Hm-hm.
- So brave.
- Okay.
-  -  Moira!
Sebastien Raine!
- Hello!
- Ohhh!
Is this place not funny?
I think it might just be one of my favorite local dives.
I love it.
It's just so unassertive.
You can't find this in New York City.
New York misses you, Moira.
You're too kind.
And correct.
Tell me things, Sebastien.
Tell me everything!
Well, I just got back from London.
I was touring with Madonna.
She commissioned a series of anti-portraits.
Whoa.
Well, it sounds brilliant.
I want to do something even more brilliant with you, Moira.
Hm.
Come, let's walk.
Creativity lives on its feet.
Anything else is bullshit.
I just ordered you a Sanka-ccino.
It's a beautiful day.
And you're a beautiful subject.
Sebastian, I must insist you stop with the flattery In due time.
-  -   So I have a quick little school form you to fill out.
Sure.
What is this?
Um nothing.
It just says that I work here.
Uh-huh.
This is for volunteer hours.
But you don't volunteer here.
You work here.
But, I volunteer to work here.
Because it's your job.
Okay but, I need these hours to graduate so So looks like you're gonna have to find somewhere to volunteer.
Okay.
It's just, I thought my community service hours would apply but they don't count because their court-ordered.
So Yeah, I think the whole point of volunteering is to give something back, right?
Okay.
Sure.
But whatever I give back has to happen within two weeks.
Well, I might have something for you but I don't think you're going to be interested.
Try me.
Well, I work with some seniors a couple times a month.
Wow.
So cute.
Um, it's just I have a thing with skin tags and old smells.
So I might just need to think on it.
Well, tonight's gonna be fun though, dance lessons!
We'd have to touch them.
-  -  Oh psst!
Hey, Johnny!
Come here!
Come here!
Come here!
- Hey Roland.
- Here sit down.
Sit.
Sit!
Okay.
Now act like you're talking to me.
I am talking to you.
No.
Not like that.
It's got to be more conversational.
You know, like, um "Yes the weather is cold".
Okay, I'm not following.
Okay, that's better.
- But try it a little more casually.
- What is going on?
Bob is trying to get his poker night together again and he wants me to play.
And I can't afford it.
Well then just say no, politely decline.
Well that's not gonna work, Johnny.
Tell him that we're doing something together tonight, okay?
Tell him you're taking me for a haircut tonight.
- Haircut?
- Hey Johnny.
- Roland.
- Oh, Bob.
- Almost didn't see you there.
- Right.
I was just Chattin' away with Johnny.
Well, I just wanted to let you know that we're starting the big poker night again, so if you're interested Uh well I wouldn't mind playing, Bob.
- Really?
- Well..
That's great!
Well, listen I'll see you both at my place, uh around seven.
Seven o'clock.
Can I ask you something?
Um, do you have even the slightest concept of what just happened here?
-  -  - Oh!
It is so nice to get away.
- Hm.
There's something very cathartic about stepping into someone else's world.
Hm.
That's one of the reasons we chose to settle here.
- David seems well.
- Well he Excuse me?
I ran into him earlier at the motel.
At the motel?
And here I thought I gave you very specific instructions to go directly to the cafe.
Ever the renegade.
Yeah, I got here and decided it was probably best to get a room.
Only a day just didn't seem enough.
You got yourself a room?
Oh, aren't you lucky!
They're usually booked up.
You must have used our name.
But Sebastien, I was under the impression that you were here just for today for a quick consult -  - Hey!
What are you doing?
Sorry, it's the way the light is catching you.
The photo took itself.
Ah, but you had to push the button.
Sebastien don't, please.
This is my talk now, shoot later look.
So, this visage is off-limits for-for the moment.
-  - Plea Don't worry, I'm just using you for scale.
It's this backdrop.
There's a provincial romanticism to all this, that's just terrifying and important.
Far be it from me to stand in the way of your inspiration.
Well, why don't you actually stand over there?
Where?
- Further into the field.
- Oh Yes!
No, into the field.
- Further!
- Huh?
- Yeah, into the field.
- Umm?
Yes.
Further!
Sebastien, I was Let the field reveal itself to you.
Okay I was wondering when we do the actual shoot um Are we thinking studio or on location?
Because I bet Mr. Schnabel would love to loan us the Palazzo -  - Yes!
Okay.
As long as you can still hear me.
I was also thinking Berlin  Oh hi!
Nice day with Sebastien?
Very productive.
I think we've laid the groundwork for an exciting enterprise.
I'm sure you'll be a wonderful subject.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
Today was more about discussing theme, - and tone, mise en scene.
- Uh-huh.
You know, he may have taken a few reference photos, but So he photographed you today then?
Hm-hm.
You know just a few dozens snaps about town picturettes, really.
Why would you have allowed this to happen?
I don't know he just started shooting and shouting and I did what he told me to do and I "leaned in" to the moment.
How did that work out for you?
I leaned in!
I don't know, David.
Why don't you try it sometime!
Everybody, I'd like to introduce Alexis, she's going to be joining us tonight.
So that way we'll all have partners.
That's great!
Dot, you won't need the Swiffer.
I guess I'll be dancing with Ted.
I thought Carol assigns the dance partners.
We'll all get a chance to dance with Ted.
Everyone up!
Come on.
This is actually very cute.
Although I did think that there would be more of them.
Yeah, well there used to be, but you know.
Oh, okay, but these ones actually smell like very clean, like baby powder.
Yeah, I think it's probably better if you call the girls by their names.
Ted, could you give me a hand with these chairs here?
Of course!
We've heard a lot about you.
That is so sweet.
Why would he bring her here?
Are you talking about me?
You can be my dance partner, dear.
Dot.
Does Dot have arthritis?
Because it looks like she's giving me the finger.
Well, she has arthritis, but not in that hand.
Bob: Full house.
Read 'em and weep.
And I think I come in second because I got a pair of Queens.
There's no second place, Roland.
Well, you were right about Bob.
He's quite the player.
I'll go see if Gwen's has any more of these bacon-wrapped scallops.
Yeah, I guess it's another trip to Bob's laundromat, right?
You know, because he keeps taking us to the cleaners.
Yeah, we get it, Roland.
I don't think it's an accident that Bob keeps winning.
What are you talking about?
Haven't you noticed how Gwen circles the table with appetizers, constantly eying Bob.
Then he lays down a big fat bet and wins.
You know, come to think of it, those matching visors they're a little suspicious I don't want to believe this, But ah, I do miss my wristwatch.
I just think it'd be interesting to see what happens if Gwen wasn't around for the next hand.
Ahhh.
Like if she had an "accident" or something?
I don't mean bump her off, Roland.
I mean, if she's not here, if she had to go to the store.
I want to see how Bob's luck gonna hold if when Gwen's not here.
It's worth a shot.
Okay, uh, do you want me to handle this?
I'm pretty good in high-stakes situations.
No.
I think, I've got it.
Okay.
Well, I'll ride shotgun with you.
So Bob.
Were just talking about how delicious the food is and you know the only thing missing is Gwen's gotta go!
I think what Roland is saying is if she could maybe go to the store to perhaps pick up some a little more Kosher?
And halal.
Gwen, you called it!
Yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
That would do it.
Yeah and some gluten-free options, for the ladies.
Oh Gosh, I'm sorry I didn't think of this.
But you know, maybe maybe Roland could go?
He's running pretty low on chips.
Sure.
I can drive.
I don't think you want to drive, Roland.
I don't mind.
I love driving.
I don't think you do.
Yeah, I don't love driving.
Not at night.
No!
And I'm drunk.
Okay.
I'm all right, dear.
I could go.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Good.
All right, so my deal.
-  -  David.
I'm glad you're here.
Come in.
Um yeah, I was just getting a drink by the uh the vending machine so I had a prolific day with your mother today.
Yes she said.
Very excited about the shoot.
The photos are really haunting.
Haunting.
Sure she'd be thrilled about that adjective.
Umm, she told me this little trip was supposed to be more of a creative discussion.
David, your Mother is a revelation.
This is the way she was meant to be presented to the world.
I'm sorry.
Is this you deciding what someone else wants again?
I-I want you to know that I care about what happened between you and me.
And while my therapist said I should never feel sorrow, I do appreciate your pain.
Okay.
And I wanna explore that.
Uh-huh.
Maybe even physically.
Oh Well, I shouldn't.
Oh you should.
Okay, fine, but um, I can't stay.
Um, okay Joan, I'm probably wrong, but I feel like the other ladies are very un-soothed by the fact that I'm here.
Oh they are, but don't worry.
It's just that we've just all grown very fond Of Ted.
Oh well we're not dating.
But I do understand that old women can get very possessive about young younger Dear, we know all about the failed engagements.
But don't worry, I'm not going to rake you over the coals to find out how on earth you ever let that one get away.
Or why?
Okay It's none of my business and I'm sure you have your reasons.
I'd just want to know what they are?
Aggressive move, Joan.
Well, I've been trying to set Ted up with my granddaughter For two years now.
And nothing.
Do you want me to put in a good word?
It wouldn't matter.
And you know why?
Is she not cute?
She's not you.
You must know that Ted is still stuck on you.
I think you ladies are just a little bit confused.
Ted and I are just very close friends.
Hm.
My husband and I were really close friends for 52 years.
Mind if I cut in?
Oh, yeah.
But I'm also happy to keep dancing with one of them.
No, I meant I could dance with Joan.
Just the ladies get pretty upset if I don't divide my time between them.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah Uh Well then I will dance with Dot!
I would rather dance with the Swiffer.
Okay  Oh, I can't believe I took that with three sevens.
Well, I guess it wasn't Gwen, was it, Johnny?
Sorry?
Nothing, nothing, Bob.
Well, uh, Johnny had this theory that Gwen and you were Johnny, why don't you tell Bob your theory.
Well, Uh You thought we were cheating?
No!
No I No offense, but I don't need to cheat to beat any of you.
It's just, you win a lot, Bob.
And there's a reason for that.
Listen now Ronnie, when you - when you have a good hand, you close your cards real quick.
And Ray, when you've got a bad hand, you start tapping your foot.
And Johnny your right eyebrow kind of just pops up And Roland well, you know I don't even know if you know the rules.
I don't know all of them.
No.
Well you know, truth is we put most of the winnings towards the snacks that Gwen serves up.
We thought it was kind of a special evening for everyone.
In my defense, I didn't believed any of this, Bob.
Gwen is very trustworthy.
- Ray, you're tapping your foot.
- Okay.
- Moira - Good morning, Sebastien.
I was up all night evaluating our little project and I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that you may have misrepresented your intentions.
I wanted to capture the real Moira Rose.
Does the real Moira Rose live in a studio?
Or the Palazzo?
I have.
And I will again.
If you're planning to capitalize on those images You just have to trust me.
With this work you will, once again, sit atop the summit of cultural conversation, with your inspired unfettering.
Oh, I'd love to believe you, but there's a big fat line between charm and bullshit.
- Give me your camera.
-  David?
!
Umm, yes Sebastien and I just had some um, stuff that we needed to talk about.
Well, I'm having a hard time landing on surprise or betrayal.
Yeah, I should probably go.
So Give me the memory card, Sebastien.
Moira, I'm scared for us.
Oh, you mean this memory card?
Yeah, I'd give it back, but I don't think it'll be of much use to you.
It accidentally fell out of your camera into my hand last night.
And then fell out of my hand into my drink.
And then I stepped on it a lot.
So It was really good to see you, Sebastien.
Good luck with the rest of this project.
David, I feel terrible that you had to do that just for me.
It wasn't just for you.
Let's just say we both won.
Okay folks, we're going to start with something a little different tonight.
The game is called crazy eights.
And the diamond shaped things are wild.
Roland, shush.
Well I'm just glad we're back here again, and that we could put all that unpleasantness behind us.
Gwen, these Teriyaki meatballs they're delicious.
Wow and those sliders look incredible.
Those aren't for you.
How's that watch working out for you?
I love it.
Thanks.
: Johnny Joahnny
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Alexis, I just got an email from your school.
Okay, in my defense, I did not know he was a substitute teacher, and basically, nothing happened.
Okay, well, that's not it, and please don't go down that path again.
Apparently there's a lice outbreak in your class.
- Oh my God!
- Ewww!
Ugh, it's probably Kelsey, she's such a horse girl.
Honestly Alexis, if you don't like the way somebody looks Dad, that's so mean!
She doesn't look like a horse, she just talks about them a lot.
And smells a bit.
You know, you keep scratching.
Ewww!
No, I'm just allergic to the down pillow.
No, no, you probably have lice.
You're scratching because you have lice!
Wait a minute, we were in all the rooms changing the sheets!
Okay, how-can lice jump?
Because if I was sleeping in my bed, could a lice jump from her bed to my bed?
Can everyone stop saying lice please?
!
Now I've gotta go back and change all the sheets again.
Okay, how do I know that she didn't give me her lice?
David, you don't have lice.
Nobody here has lice!
No, no, you do!
You-you have the lice!
- Ah!
- Ughhh!
- Oh!
Aah!
- Alexis, you've gotta go to the store and get something to deal with that now!
Okay, I've gotta go back and change all the sheets.
Oh!
This is the last time I take a pity selfie with Kelsey!
- Get away from me!
- Aah!
Housekeeping.
- Hello!
- Oh, hi.
Uh, just here for the complimentary sheet change.
But the bed's already made up.
Yes, yes, well some of our guests prefer morning and evening sheets.
Uh, these are a little heavier, for sleeping, right?
So if you don't mind, I'll just get to it.
I think we're good, I mean, we haven't even touched the sheets.
Oh, good, good, good!
Why is that good?
Well, it just means you're having a busy day, you know, up and at 'em.
- Oh.
- Right.
Right.
And your hair's in a ponytail, that's fantastic.
Yeah And by that I mean it's very hot outside, and gives the neck a chance to breathe, um yeah.
So We're actually just on our way out so Oh well, good timing then, huh?
So why don't we follow you out, hmm?
So that's a yes to changing the sheets?
No, no, I think we're good.
Thanks.
After you.
Oh, so leaving everything as is, then.
Couple: Yeah!
Hi, sorry I'm late, it's been a busy morning.
How are you?
I'm fine, thank you.
It's nice to see you.
Hm!
Are you talking to me?
I'm not used to that ah, level of kindness.
Yes, we haven't seen each other in weeks, so I was just saying it's nice to see you.
I'm going to ignore that passive aggression, and instead, lean in to the fact that we're both working professionals now, and Mama Oprah would be very proud of us.
Okay, that's one way to look at it.
Um, so you know what I think would be super fun, if we hung out at your place tonight.
- My place?
- Mhm.
You've never been to my place.
Yeah exactly, you were just saying that we haven't been spending as much time together, and that it's been really bothering you.
I don't remember saying that last part.
Yeah, so I was just thinking like, what about a late night hang, or like, a platonic sleepover?
Mm what's on your head?
Hm?
A hat.
That I'm test driving for the store.
I mean, what's happening under the hat?
- The other side.
- Oh, I see.
Yeah um, that would be a shower cap.
So this would have nothing to do with the lice outbreak at the motel?
Your dad just called me.
Mhm, um so I might be taking preventative measures.
I can't afford to have the store infested with lice.
I don't think it works that way, but just so we're clear, you were wanting to have a platonic sleepover at my place would have nothing to do with the fact that your sister has lice?
Yes, that is almost entirely correct.
Oh Moira: Good morning!
Bob: Who's gonna be the one to tell her?
I'll handle this.
Have I been let go?
Should I leave?
- No.
- I won't make a scene.
You still have three and a half more years.
But who's counting?
Roland: Moira, I know that town beautification is kind of your thing, so I know you'll wanna know that um we're gonna build a flower garden.
And it gets better!
I imagine it must.
We're gonna name it after you.
Oh, and look at that right there, utter shock!
Now, I'm flattered beyond all reason, but I can't help but think the money could be better spent elsewhere, making much needed improvements to the roads, the streetlamps, the parks, the sidewalks, the traffic light Moira, I don't think you understand how rare it is for somebody to have something named for them in this town!
I mean, yeah, the whole town is named after me, and Bob over here, he's got his bench.
Bob's Bench.
And Ronnie's got her rec center.
It's an outdoor tennis court, and last year the net was stolen.
Well, she's kind of under selling it there, the rec center is a major hook-up spot for the kids.
- So is the bench.
- Right.
As much as I would love to contribute to the population growth of this town by way of teen pregnancies, I must decline.
Honey, it's all about legacy!
Your name will forever be associated with this town's name!
I don't think you're helping.
I truly appreciate the gesture.
Well look, before you say no - No.
- Right.
This is a really big deal, Moira.
For us to be doing this for you.
Okay.
Ted: Alexis, I didn't think you were coming in today.
Oh um, I hadn't planned to, but it was really bugging me that your cupboards were so disorganized.
It's Saturday.
No, I know.
Um But the other reason is that I bumped into one of our clients, and her dog has lice, and she's worried that she now has lice.
Who was it?
Umm Meredith?
Meredith!
She's new-ish, you might not remember her, just kind of like, mid-length, wavy hair.
- Does she want me to help her?
- No.
No, she is too embarrassed.
And I was like Mere-dith, Meredith, there's no reason to be embarrassed, you're still exceptionally attractive, it's just lice, just get the shampoo, and deal with it!
Yeah okay um the thing is, that you can't actually get lice from dogs.
It's a different kind of lice.
Okay, so what should she use?
Should she use the flea stuff, or Oh no, she's fine to use the lice shampoo, but it's really more about combing them out.
- Ewww!
- On the upside, you could tell her that they're only attracted to clean scalps, and she shouldn't be too embarrassed.
Also, I'm kind of a samurai when it comes to a metal comb, so Okay, are you sure, because she didn't want to um, she didn't wanna bug you on a weekend.
- Bug me.
-  I am sure.
Okay, I will tell her.
Um, you know that it's me, right?
- Yeah, caught on pretty quick.
- Okay, thank you.
You're the sweetest little vet I've ever met.
I don't know about little, because I'm benching 225 right now, so it's not really something someone little - Aaah, Ted!
- Okay, yep.
Okay, so if you wouldn't mind sorting these body milks by size, that would be great.
Can you drink these?
Um, it's liquid moisturizer, for your body, so no, you can't drink them.
Did you ask if you can drink it, too?
Okay, it says body milk on the label!
You know, I told David that the label was gonna be misleading, but he insisted.
What was it you said?
"Anyone with a fiber of common sense would know that it's not actually milk".
What do we think body milk is, if not milk for your body?
!
- Exactly.
- Stevie, right?
- Yeah.
- I'm Patrick.
- I've heard a lot about you.
- None of it is true.
Oh well, anyone with a fiber of common sense would know that.
I like him.
I like you.
Okay, is this how this is gonna go?
Because we have way too much work to do today for me to feel attacked by way of an imbalanced social dynamic.
Are-are you wearing a shower cap?
!
Alexis has lice, and I am taking preventative measures.
By wearing one of our hats that we now can't sell.
Oh, he doesn't have it, I checked his head.
I think the shower cap is more of a fashion choice - at this point.
- Uh huh.
But you're living with somebody who does have lice, so just 'cause you don't have it now, doesn't mean that you couldn't get it tonight, or tomorrow, or whenever.
It's almost as if you want me to get the lice.
I don't want you to get it, I just, I think you should be careful.
You can crash at my place tonight if you need to.
Thank you.
But Stevie offered her place this morning.
- Oh, - So - Can I crash at your place?
-  This is really fun for me.
I'm having a lot of fun.
I never thought I'd see the day, John.
You've been domesticated beyond recognition.
Moira, it's been a bit of a day here.
Well, this might lift your spirits, I just came from council, and they want to name a garden after me.
A garden?
Oh, that's flattering.
Another feather in your cap, huh?
Oh, I have enough legacies as it is, John.
I've got that playhouse theater in Pasadena, My titular scholarship with Phoenix, David and Alexis.
Yeah, but still, a garden is nice.
You'd have to think twice about turning that down.
Oh, I've already turned it down.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, it's just about a month ago I heard from the Lucy Albion Studio Theater in Pasadena.
I don't know what that is.
It used to be called the Moira Rose No, no!
Don't say it!
They've stripped the playhouse of my name?
Who the  is Lucy Albion?
!
A volunteer usher who died last year.
And when were you planning on telling me this, John?
!
Well Moira, it's not like you have overreacted to bad news in the past.
I just thought it might sit better with you once you'd heard about the garden.
No, I just told you about the garden.
Uh-huh.
John, did you ask Roland and Bob to name a garden after me?
No, no!
They wanted to name the garden after you, Moira.
After I offered to pay for the plaque, and a good chunk of the upkeep.
I don't believe this.
Sweetheart, I just thought having your own garden in town would make losing the theater less painful!
Oh, I won't be pitied, John!
Or fed your pacifying pablum like some kind of soft-headed infant!
Well, I thought it was a nice gesture.
Oh no, no, now I just wonder what else you're keeping from me.
Nothing!
- Well, Alexis has lice.
- What?
!
Ewwww!
Ewwwww!
I assume you shaved her head!
And we have to put a wig on her.
But not one of my wigs!
These have to be boxed now!
Moira, I've got it all taken care of.
And I'd think twice about that garden.
Oh, it's too late, the notion of that garden is as abhorrent to me as our daughter's scalp!
And I was worried about you overreacting.
What are you doing in here?
Well, you said to change the sheets.
No, we said not to change the sheets.
Oh, you said not to change the sheets!
I could've sworn I heard you say change the sheets.
- Well, while I'm here, I may as well - Please, just leave the bed.
- Sure.
- What's going on?
What's going on?
Well, my okay.
My daughter and I were setting up the room earlier, and it turns out she has lice.
I was changing the sheets because you know, I didn't wanna take a chance.
Been there.
Yeah, our six year old daughter had lice last year.
- How old's yours?
- 28.
Oh, and I checked your hairbrush and it is fine.
You checked my hairbrush?
!
It's a complimentary service.
Ted: Why didn't you just tell me that you had lice?
Ted, a bug literally fell out of my head, onto my textbook this morning.
It was so disgusting.
Plus I didn't want you to picture me like some well-toned bug woman.
Well, I've seen worse.
Fleas, ticks, worms.
Granted, all of those were on house pets.
- Ted!
- I'm just saying, that you know, it could've been worse.
I could be shearing you with trimmers right now.
You're really good at this.
It reminds me of when I was in Bangkok.
There was this amazing little Resto-Lounge that specialized in Tahitian food, and scalp massages.
I'm not sure what's more disgusting, what I'm doing right now, or the concept for that restaurant.
It was a Resto-Lounge.
Speaking of Thailand, I think is probably the most intimate thing I've ever done with an employee.
Speaking of Thailand, I think we've done a few more intimate things than this.
I meant while they were an employee.
Not that I'd do this for anyone else.
Well, thank you.
Because it's actually pretty gross.
You said it wasn't that bad.
Well, there are some big ones in here.
- Ewww!
- I'm joking, I'm joking.
Oh, maybe not.
- Eww!
- Nope, it's fine.
It is fine, it's fine.
Just-just the mama, we got her.
Hi, I can't thank you enough for inviting me.
Really you should be thanking yourself for that.
This is a lot nicer than I expected.
For some reason I pictured you living underground.
In like, a bomb shelter?
Yeah like, bomb shelter aspects.
Look at what you've done to this place!
Look at all this stuff!
Look at that frame on the wall that you put there.
Look at that Sarah McLachlan poster!
Don't be dissing Sarah McLachlan.
Who's dissing Sarah McLachlan?
I followed Lilith Fair for two summers.
-  - So Uh oh!
Two toothbrushes?
Hello!
No, you see, this is exactly why I shouldn'tve let you bully me into allowing you to stay here!
Do you require two toothbrushes?
Yes, I do.
Ahhh So maybe I was seeing somebody a while ago, and I forgot to throw out his toothbrush.
I don't recall you ever telling me about that chapter of your life.
Well, I'm sure I would've told you, if you weren't so busy with the store.
I'm sorry, is that a soft, yet affirmative indication that you miss me?
No, it is not.
Because I agree, our social predicament is not ideal, but we are both thriving professionally, and I feel like that needs to be celebrated.
Speaking of, where are the drinks?
- In this thing?
- The fridge.
- Is this okay.
- Just Okay, I just see two de-shelled hard-boiled eggs in a bag, should I be scared for you?
The vodka's in the freezer.
Oh, in the freezer, okay.
There she is!
Look at that, look at her, go.
What a gift.
- Moira!
- Oh, hi.
I just wanted to say congratulations about the garden.
Oh well, you're very kind, but I've declined the offer.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
As much as I love the spotlight, sometimes it's best to just step aside.
That's surprising.
I know when they told me that they were gonna put my name on the new low-impact play center at the school, I was thrilled!
Yes, it can be very exciting when the tribute matches the contribution.
My name graced a theater, a country club ladies' locker room, a roadway.
A whole road?
Oh, not just any road.
This was a lifesaving road, dedicated to emergency vehicles.
Like a fire route?
Technically it was referred to as Evacuation Route 14, but those of us in the know affectionately called it "Moira Rose Boulevard".
You know, Moira, having your name on a small, local garden wouldn't take away from any of those other amazing achievements.
You might think, but this little particular little tribute was bought by my husband, in an attempt to assuage my ego!
And that would be different from the other times because Well, I mean, of course philanthropy and recognition always go hand in hand, but Listen.
I know this isn't what you wanted, But I think it would make Johnny really happy to make you happy.
I mean, take Roland.
Every year he buys me coconut macaroons, and I just don't have the heart to tell him I am really allergic to coconut.
Yeah, every Valentine's Day I just rash right up.
Last year my throat almost completely shut.
I shouldn'tve eaten those eggs.
I can't believe I'm trapped under a blanket with you knowing you ate those eggs.
I bet Patrick's fridge is fully stocked.
What does that mean?
!
It means he's got his life together.
He's a pretty eligible bachelor.
Patrick.
I suppose.
What?
He's my business partner.
Oh, aren't they all.
What are you doing?
What, you guys just seem to really get along well.
Yeah, because we're in business together, and compliment each other professionally.
Hm, but he offered for you to stay over at his place.
Yes, because unlike you and I, he's extremely generous, and has absolutely no ulterior motive.
Then why are you here and not there?
Because you asked me first.
I didn't, though.
And it would be weird.
Well, if nothing's going on, why would it be weird?
Because we're in business together, and I don't know what his preferences are.
Well, you're not gonna find out what his preferences are on a sleepover with me.
Well, I wouldn't be sharing a bed with him, I'd be in some guest bedroom.
Guest bedroom, what is he, Bill Gates?
Yes, he's Bill Gates.
I like this for you.
Like what?
There's nothing to like.
You seem flustered.
I'm not flus Maybe it's the eggs.
Both: Ughh!
Um, am I reading this right?
"The Moira's Rose's Garden".
Okay look, I went back and forth on the name a couple of times, and I may have confused the engraver.
The Moira's Rose's Garden.
So the garden is dedicated to a rose that Moira owns?
I don't think that there are enough apostrophes.
I don't even see a rose in the garden.
Because there aren't any roses.
Or are we the Roses?
Okay, I'm getting roses for the garden, I'm-I'm getting roses.
Oh okay.
And what are these numbers for?
That's mom's birthday, David.
Those are the last four digits of your father's credit card.
It was a complicated order form, all right?
There were a lot of fields to fill in.
Um, I hope you got a really good deal on this.
It's by the letter, so he paid extra for those apostrophe "s's".
Okay, enough, enough.
This is still a very big honor for your mother.
Is it not?
- Mhm - Yes?
Mhm.
So when we die, are we all gonna be buried here?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1  Oh, Moira, kids this is so unnecessary.
What is it?
It's a gift from us to your father.
Okay.
Yeah, I rather not attach my name to a gift that I had no hand in selecting.
Oh, God.
Oh my God.
Where did you find this, honey?
Well, Moira told me it was down at the post office, - so I - I was talking to my wife.
The Van Housens found it in their storage room and thought that we should have it.
Who's the lady in the back?
It's Moira.
Flattering.
It's a family portrait, Roland.
Oh you - you all look like cartoons.
- Wow.
It's so weird, I don't even remember posing for this.
Because you didn't.
You were in rehab when we sat for this.
I wasn't in rehab, I was at rehab visiting Stavros.
Oh, that's right.
We had your face painted on the body of my assistant.
Hm.
That's why you look so good.
Well, I love it.
Let's get this inside.
- David.
- Huh?
What?
20 bucks, I'll give you a hand taking it in.
- Oh yeah.
David.
- What?
!
- 30 bucks and I'll help you in with it.
- Mm, right.
David!
I don't know what!
What?
What?
What?
What do you want?
40 buck and I'll help you in with in.
I can keep going up.
Can play this game all day, pal.
I can't tell if this room is just very, very small, or if the portrait is very, very big.
Well, I think it's quite possible both are true.
Do you think the Van Housens had it enlarged?
No, Th-this is the actual size.
Remember, Reiner wanted to paint it twice as big.
Oh, look at it, John.
Well, don't worry, we'll we'll find a place for it.
Ah, you know, we can take things off a wall, or mm rearrange some furniture.
Maybe move some wigs.
Oh John, I know how nostalgic you still get for the old days, and I just wanted to do something thoughtful for you.
Oh, Moira, this portrait is a wonderful reminder of your generous spirit and the enormous strength of this family.
Aw - -  Um, is that your juice?
Ah, no.
Technically, I think it's our juice, ah, because you just took it from the fridge and didn't pay for it so Mm-hm.
Um It's just that I don't normally share beverages with people.
Really.
That is shocking news.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fortunately, um, you look like you have a clean mouth so Sorry.
A clean mouth?
Yeah.
Some people have nice, clean mouths, and some people have sloppy mouths.
I see.
So, hey, I was thinking about our, ah, our launch party, and I think we should take out like a full page in the local news, and just make it a make it a thing, you know.
Mm um Well, do you not think people are gonna show?
No, no.
I do.
I just think if we're going big, let's go big.
Yeah.
'Cause um, 'cause I was thinking what if we did like a soft launch.
Um, and you know, just test the store out on a small group of people.
Did like an exclusive VIP guest list, and offered, you know, a friends and family discount as incentive.
Ha, now it's sounding like you don't think people will show.
No, I do.
I do think, um, that people will come.
It's just, you know, I look to like Gwyneth who soft-launched the 'goop' newsletter and now it's a thriving lifestyle publication slash empire, and I have no idea what you're talking about, but it's up to you.
Ah, either way you do need to call the electrician to hang these lights that were supposed to be up a week ago.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was waiting I was waiting for a call back from him.
- Mm.
- But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna follow up.
Sure.
Can I have my juice back, please?
No.
You have a sloppy mouth.
- - Hey, did Mrs. Syzlak call?
She's late for her appointment.
Um yeah.
She cancelled.
She said that her cat is better.
She doesn't have a cat.
Okay.
Sorry, who am I thinking of?
Um, somebody isn't coming in today and someone's cat is better.
Oh, and someone's something may be worse Is everything okay?
You usually take down the messages, even if you forget to give them to me.
It's just that my grades are being posted today so I'm just kind of avoiding the computer.
Oh.
O-o-okay.
Well, that's not really an option so how about I'll just look for you.
No, it's okay, I can do it.
It's just that if I fail I may need the afternoon off.
Also not an option, but I will be here for you if it's bad news.
Oh my God, Ted.
- I passed!
- Really?
Yeah.
I got a 60 and a 65!
No, Alexis, those are the class averages.
You got a 63 and a 68!
Oh my God!
-  -  Ju Well uh congrats.
Um.
Thank you.
Um, I'm just gonna, um I'm just gonna call Mrs. Syzlak, and just make sure that her cat's doing okay.
It's Mrs. Syzlak and she doesn't have a cat, but you should call her back.
and I, in the mean time, will go to get back to work-o.
- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
-  Hmm 'Kay.
- - Hi, so I wanted to talk to you about Oh my God.
Yeah.
I know.
We're still looking for a place to hang it.
Did it grow?
Can we cover it with something or?
I tried.
Sheets aren't big enough.
Can we help you, David?
Uh, yes.
Actually I wanted you to be the first to know that Patrick and I will be launching the store this Friday.
-  Ooh!
- Oh great news!
- A grand opening.
- Mm.
Hm.
We've doing more of a soft launch.
- I don't like the sound of that.
- Why?
It's actually a very effective business strategy.
And it's always better to go under.
- Go under?
- No.
David, if the business is foundering it's best to tell us now.
No!
When it comes to expectations it's always to go under than over.
Yeah, I don't know if that's true, son.
Every Rose video we opened had fireworks.
Day or night.
People love pizazz.
Okay, well, this is gonna be the opposite of that.
We're inviting a select group of VIP's, and offering a 25 percent friends and family discount.
- Well, that sounds meek.
- Okay.
Friends are getting the same discount as family?
That doesn't sound right.
Well, that's what we're doing.
Well, what if your mother and I go in and buy something together?
Does that mean we get a 50 percent discount?
Why would you wanna spend less money at my store?
David, we are happy to support this modest little vigil you're hosting but to hand out discounts before the store has even birthed it sounds a tad defeatist.
I hope you don't mind if I keep this information to myself.
I don't want you to share the news.
The smaller the better.
Oh, rarely has that been a recipe for success.
I'm really glad I came in here.
- We love you!
- Keep reaching, son!
Hello.
Um, I called Mrs. Syzlak, and sorted it all out.
She will be in tomorrow.
So, I'm just gonna go back to my desk, which is where I work.
Uh, we should talk about the kiss.
Definitely.
Personally, I don't think it was that a big deal.
Yeah.
Neither do I. We're adults.
We should be allowed to have an adult kiss from time to time.
- Totally.
An adult kiss.
- Yes!
Like when parents kiss their friends ju on the mouth.
Yes.
Like kissing your parents.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
Yeah.
I mean, we're friends so Agreed.
Oh!
Here's something, speaking of friend stuff, um David is doing this friends and family discount for his store opening.
And I know that you love discounts, so, I was thinking that maybe we could go - Yeah.
That sounds yeah.
- As friends.
I would go as family, and you would go as friends of the family.
Well, I do love discounts.
In fact they had to delete Groupon from my phone last week, just 'cause three vacuums is enough vacuums.
Yeah.
Cool.
Okay.
So um back to work-o.
- Watch out!
Oh.
-  Oh!
Ow.
- Oh my God.
- Isn't it something?
Huh?
I always felt something was missing in here and then it occurred to me that a lot of family-run businesses hang a portrait of the family in the workplace.
Oh.
Well, that reminds me, I've been meaning to have my family portrait airlifted in Well, I know it's a little arresting at first, but I think with time you won't even know it's here.
Mm I don't think that's gonna happen.
You don't look very happy in this.
Well, it wasn't the style to look happy.
The motivation was to look successful.
You know this used to hang in the great hall of our house.
Oh, now this seems a little understated for a great hall.
I'd look at it every morning.
The family often wasn't all together back then, but, uh, I could look at this and there we were.
Well, you guys are together, like, all the time now, so, who needs this, - right?
- Well, that's true.
But, this happens to be one of the only possessions that wasn't sold off.
Really?
You'd think there'd be more of a market for oversized paintings of other people's families.
Why does it seem like Mrs. Roses eyes are following me?
Oh, she paid extra for that.
-  Here you go.
- - Two tuna melts.
- Oh.
I didn't order tuna melts, - but I don't have time to - Oh, by the way, I hope you don't mind, but I told a few people about your big store opening.
Big store opening?
Isn't it a friends and family sale.
Yes.
Which is why you would be invited as a friend.
- Um, who told you about our little - David, just the guy I wanted to see.
Listen, uh, Gwen wanted me to ask you Er, if if we both have plus-ones for the opening, or do we have to be each other's plus-ones.
Who's Gwen?
That's very funny.
Oh, my mother's boyfriend wanted to bring his secretary.
He did?
Why not.
Um, I'm gonna go.
But I'm really glad that someone told you.
um and Bob and Gwen.
Uh how many people did you tell about Friday?
Just the names on my pre-approved list.
Why?
Uh, because I have been approached by a lot of people who are not on the pre-approved list.
Well, you know, sometimes when you tell everyone that it's exclusive, then everybody just wants in.
Like how many people are we talking about?
Uh, I don't know.
Twyla's whole family.
So, like, 75?
- Should've ordered more food and wine.
- Uh Well, looks like this soft launch is firming up a bit, huh.
But it's not supposed to be firm.
Well, with this many people it's definitely at least semi-firm.
Okay.
Well, as long as it doesn't get hard.
And that's something, that's what I just said to you, so What?
Oh my God.
Hey, back of the line, bro!
Hey!
No cutting!
'Scuse me, this is my store.
Who are you?
I'm Darleen's cousin.
Who the fuck are you?
My God.
Ah That kind of language, folks, will not be tolerated at Rose Apothecary.
Thank you.
- This is a safe place.
-  Uh, so I was just verbally assaulted by a very off-brand customer in line outside.
Well, David, I have really underestimated you.
How so?
Who knew you had so many friends, or, uh, family members, - for that matter.
- Okay.
What do we do?
- I for one blame Gwyneth.
Um - David, relax.
It's going to be fine.
Oh my God, the lights!
I didn't call the electrician.
-  - Do Watched a lot of YouTube tutorials.
This is very impressive.
Well, there is a good chance I didn't wire that properly, so that's why I also got the insurance that you forgot to get.
M'kay.
Um, there's only so much that I can do in a day.
- Mm.
- So um Are we ready to do this?
Open the doors.
Okay  Softly.
Okay.
Find everything okay?
-  -   Wow.
Wow.
David did all this?
I can't believe it.
He's managed to create, in this town, something truly winsome.
I would shop here, John.
Even without a nagging sense of obligation.
And look at look at the labels on everything.
-  - 'Rose Apothecary.
' The Rose name on another plucky young business.
We should go congratulate him.
We should but our son is very hard at work.
Doing it.
Here you go.
And the scarf.
Is this wearing it, is it?
So um, this says foot cream on it.
What happens if I use it on my hand?
Um, I'm pretty sure your hands are gonna be fine.
Okay, and it's like 50 percent off if Jocelyn and I both buy it at the same time?
Um, n-no.
Have you been talking to my dad - about the discount?
- Roly, you can bargain later.
Um, David, I need to ask ya a little question about this baggy of Joshua tree tea?
- Sure.
- Is it drugs?
Uh, no.
It's loose leaf tea.
Okay.
Because it smells exactly like Oh, come on!
Ah, wow!
Geez, I didn't realize this place was a front.
It's not a front.
That is a tea that Mr. Hockley makes out of a greenhouse on his farm.
And now that I've said it out loud, I might have to double check.
Hmm.
Well, honey, why don't we, um, grab a few bags of Mr. Hockley's - tea.
- Go get 'em.
I love tea.
Yeah, I'm a big tea drinker now.
Started drinking tea in high school.
Cedar dragon.
Hm.
That's different.
What do you think?
Um.
mm.
Mm, yeah, you know?
Um, I don't know.
I mean, it's nice but I also, I don't know.
I think you should probably get it or not, whatever Oh!
Look who's here!
Alexis and - Ted.
- Oh, Ted.
Good to see you, Mr. and Mrs. Rose.
I take it that Alexis has told you the big news?
- Big news?
-  Um well, it wasn't that big a deal, but the other day at work Ted and I went to hug No, ah, actually I was talking about you passing your exams.
Honey!
You passed!
-  - Oh!
Alexis, what a delightful surprise!
Not that I'm surprised.
I had nothing but doubts No doubts.
That you could do this.
Well, I'm just glad to be done.
- Well, it's been quite the day, Moira.
- Mm-hm.
You know, I had an idea about what to do with the portrait.
Oh, it's still there, waiting for us.
Isn't it?
I was thinking, to save space, we could cut our faces out and make four smaller, individual portraits.
We could here's another thought: we bid it farewell.
Are you kidding?
Doesn't fit, John.
And I don't just mean literally.
We aren't those people anymore.
We are, but we aren't.
You know, you might be right.
It's funny when I look at that portrait now, I find myself wondering Were we really that happy back then?
- Yes.
- We were.
Oh, deliriously happy.
Oh, and I miss that beach house.
Oh my God, I still dream that we wake up in our old bed.
- Nothing's changed.
- No.
No.
We can't go down that road, Moira.
We have to focus on what we do have.
No?
Yes.
Yes.
Ah, hey, I Alexis?
I, um Oh, right.
You were going that way.
Ah, no, no.
I want to say, that I got you a little something for passing your exams.
Oh.
Oh, Ted!
You picked up a stick.
Uh, no, it's a it's a pencil shaped like a twig.
I got it at the store.
Wasn't that was sneaky of you.
I will definitely try to use this.
It looks very delicate.
Yeah, it's a lot more expensive than I thought, too.
I hate it when they don't put price tags on things.
Thank you, Ted.
Oh, no I didn't I didn't mean.
That was supposed to be like, um like a thank you adult kiss.
Yeah, the thing is I think, um, maybe we should just avoid kisses for a while.
Even adult ones.
Of course.
Probably better if we just adult hug and adult work together.
I totally get that.
Okay.
Great.
Adult high five?
Yeah.
- -   Well, this was a success.
I would say so.
Yeah.
Although, you know, we'd be, ah, 25 percent richer If we just done a hard launch.
But hey, I'm just a numbers guy.
Mm-hm.
Um, but had we not done the soft launch we wouldn't have lured all those people.
Mm.
Well, you know, the best thing is that we never have to talk about it again because we've officially open.
That is true.
Congratulations, man.
Congratulations to you.
- I can fix that.
Kinda liking - Okay.
Yeah.
I was just gonna say that that might need fixing.
Well, it fits here.
I wonder what else the Van Housens took from us.
Don't waste your time thinking about those human vultures.
I think they did us a favour.
They sent us a reminder that it's not always good to hold onto the past.
Speak for yourself, I look super cute.
Okay, that's not actually your body though.
Um, okay, but it's my face, David.
Okay, let's go.
There's something really weird happening with mom's eyes.
It's like they're following me.
- Oh, they are.
- Oh God.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1 Alexis, I have a favour Oh, great.
Um I would love a ride to work.
I meant, I have a favour to ask.
You just said that you have a favour.
As in, for me.
Well, who says that, 'I have a favour for you?
' Okay.
Are you saying that you can't drive me to work?
No, I can't.
I need you to work the motel this Friday.
Ewww!
What?
!
We're all pitching in these days, dear.
Like communists or non-union actors.
Okay.
Well, I would love to, but it's my high school graduation on Friday.
Your graduation is this Friday?
- Mhm.
- What?
I didn't tell you because I don't want you to come.
It's bad enough that I have to wear that unflattering black dress and then the hat with the thing on it in front of people that I don't know.
Yeah, I'm not going.
I was at your first graduation and it's not my fault that you weren't there.
We all have to go, David, unless you have some special excuse.
It's my birthday.
Yeah.
Well We, we didn't forget.
No, we've been talking about it for weeks.
You've been talking about it for weeks.
Well, we'll just have to have a birthday and graduation celebration all in one.
Yeah.
I'm very uninterested in that option.
- As am I. - No.
Seriously don't come.
They can't say we didn't try.
- Ugh.
- What?
Woof David.
Oh, can I get a gift receipt for that?
It's for an anniversary.
Oh.
Well, isn't that thoughtful.
I wish everyone remembered special days like that, but, alas, that's not what this world is anymore.
I'll just take that gift receipt.
Yeah.
Okay.
- You're a good person.
- Uh.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
It's fine.
All right.
Here is a question.
Um, has your family ever forgotten your birthday?
Like your parents and your sister, collectively, as a whole?
That would be a no.
No, I've always had some kind of party.
- Oh.
- In fact, sometimes two parties.
One before school ended with my friends.
And then another with my family with my cousins who were kinda more like siblings.
But they, they forget other things.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Yeah.
I'm kinda piecing together that it might be your birthday?
Yes, it is.
Well, happy birthday.
How old are we Do you have any plans for today or?
Ah, I plan on popping a pill, crying a bit and falling asleep early.
So just a regular weeknight.
Well, it sounds like fun!
It is.
You ever tried the Cafe Tropical?
I've heard people raving about how "moderately edible" the food is there.
Well, yes.
We could, we could go for a birthday dinner.
- You don't have to do that.
- No, I-I'd like to.
- Sure.
- Let's say eight o'clock.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Those are wet now.
- That's a lot of spritzing.
- I'm gonna dry those off.
- Okay.
Okay, another girl dropped off her resume this morning.
Ted, have you read these?
These are actually very impressive.
There are people here who went to school specifically for vet stuff.
Yeah, well, y'know, formal training is usually encouraged.
Well, I don't have formal training.
This person's assisted with surgeries.
Is that something that I should be doing?
No.
God no.
Well, Ted, if there are people here that can help you, you should hire them.
Well I'm very happy with the job that you're doing.
And I I like having you here.
Well, I like being here, but not as much as like  Tiffany Seraris.
The poor thing went to cat camp.
So what are you saying?
Well, I'm saying I didn't realize that there was a huge pile of way more qualified people just like waiting to be hired.
Yeah.
But you're learning.
I know, but I'm taking someone's desk here.
Like someone who actually wants to touch animals a lot.
Like Maybe there's a job out there that I'm better suited for.
And some other like gorgeous, slightly under qualified girl is sitting at my desk asking herself the same question.
Okay I'm just realizing that wanting to come in and laugh at your animal puns isn't enough when there is like people here.
Those were genuine laughs?
Sometimes, yeah.
Well, I can't say the reception will be as fun, but that's really generous of you, Alexis.
Like, surprisingly generous.
No I know.
So, um, I guess I should go.
I have my graduation tonight, so.
Well, it's only eleven.
And I am paying you for the day.
I totally get that.
I will stay until four.
Day ends at five, but sure.
Johnny: Damian Steele.
Okay, we will see you soon!
Bye.
Yeah.
Stevie!
Stevie!
- Stevie: Have you tried restarting it?
- What?
Oh.
Sorry, I thought you were having trouble with the computer again.
No, no.
Well, I'm stuck on all caps, but no.
Come here, take a look.
Look, we are sold out.
I just booked the last room.
Are you sure you didn't put the same reservation in twice?
Because you've done that before.
No.
Booked.
We can now fire up the 'no' in the 'no vacancy' sign.
Oh, yeah, that burnt out years ago.
Sadly it hasn't been an issue, but maybe we could use the 'no' from the 'no refunds' sign.
All right.
We'll figure out.
But I am so proud of our little team.
Up here.
Come on.
I don't think we're those kind of people.
In the sky!
Here we go!
Yeah!
Big day!
Big day, Stevie!
Moira: As long as we have some time, I thought we'd revisit this delightful little number.
I can't even remember why we stopped working on it.
Because we are an ensemble group And this requires a lead vocal that just happens to be in your range.
Ronnie, When one of us shines, all of us shine.
That is the meaning of ensemble.
Sorry, gals.
I just got caught up on the phone.
I have good news and, and some bad news.
Oh.
Is the bad news that there is no good news?
My aunt used to play this game with me a lot.
The good news is I just got off the phone with the little towns big voices festival and the Elmdale songbirds have had to drop out at the last minute.
They got a terrible stomach flu that just run right through them.
So the festival was wondering if the Jazzagals would sub in tonight!
-  - Oh, wow.
And of course the bad news is that Moira and I won't be able to attend.
Oh.
I'm sorry, w-why can't I?
Because your daughter is graduating high school.
Oh.
And what a grand night it will be for you and your charges.
But the Roses' will not be at graduation.
No, Alexis has veritably browbeaten us not to attend.
I wouldn't be surprised if she skips the whole affair herself.
Waggish little nymph, that she is.
So Well, then I guess it's just me that won't be making it to the festival.
Oh, Jocelyn, don't worry we will do you proud.
I think we might just have the perfect number for it.
Don't you think?
Well, look at you You are radiant.
Hardly.
You are, Alexis.
Oh, I'd advise against the mortarboard.
It'll flattens the hair and pull focus away from that beautiful face.
Well, I think everyone has to wear one.
Hm.
But by not wearing one, you'll stand out.
And by the fact that you're a good ten years older than everyone else.
Okay.
Um, is this straight?
Does it look okay?
Mhm.
I'm so proud of you.
I don't know why.
Everybody graduates from high school.
You know, it isn't easy.
Especially at your age.
Okay, Can you please stop saying that.
Alexis, you've worked very hard and now that you've done this, the world is gonna open up wide for you.
Um, you know It's not too late if you wanna come.
Hey, it's okay.
Don't worry about me.
Mommy is going to be fine.
And I'll respect your wishes.
I'm just saying like if you do wanna come.
Well, it's a little late now.
Whatever, if you have plans that's totally fine.
Now I do.
Now I'm doing a big concert with the Jazzagals.
Because you're the one who told us you didn't want anyone there.
Okay.
Totally is, it's totally fine.
Had I known.
It's gonna be long and boring anyway so.
Alexis.
Alexis, I hope you know that you have been and always will be one of my top priorities.
Thanks.
Well, we'll see you afterwards.
We'll all have lots to celebrate then.
All of us.
I almost didn't see you there through the mad rush of the Friday night dinner crowd.
I'm just so relieved that I made a reservation.
Yes.
Well, You look very nice.
Oh, thanks.
Well, you know, I assumed that the cafe would have a dinner jacket policy and I didn't wanna wear one of theirs.
Mhm.
Well, the amazing thing about this place is that they've done such a wonderful job of editing down the menu to a very concise, world-class selection of international cuisine.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Dare we try the deep fried mozzarella stick platter?
Mmm.
They do a lovely wine pairing with that so Sorry, I'm late.
Is everybody here or are other people coming?
I don't know.
Is anyone else coming?
No.
This is uh, this is it.
In case you didn't know, I'm widely popular.
Some might even venture to call me beloved.
That's a bit of a stretch.
Welcome Stevie.
I, I, I'm sorry if I'd known you were coming I would have them set three places but - Oh.
- Did I not tell you?
But, you know, hey, the more the merrier.
I'm just going to hit the restroom real quick.
And then I'll come back.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
- Is this okay?
- Yeah.
Why?
Because he bought you a present.
It's very nicely wrapped.
So I think I'm crashing a date?
Oh, no.
No, no.
He thinks you guys were here, one-on-one.
He brought you a present.
I didn't even get you a present.
No, I noticed that.
Do you want me to look?
No I don't want you to look.
Okay, I'll just say this if there's anything remotely sentimental in here, he is on a date with you right now.
Sophie Nguyen  Brad Poloski Which ones are your parents?
Oh, um, I told them not to come.
Alexis Rose.
Oh, I see you found my present.
Um, Yeah.
We just didn't want anything to spill on it.
So you put it on the table?
- Yeah.
- Huh Open it, David!
Oh, no, no, no no, you can open it later.
It's really not a big deal.
It's not This is the first gift I haven't bought myself in a very long time.
So thank you.
You're gonna be really underwhelmed when you open it.
Trust me.
It's not-See.
It's nothing.
What is it?
Oh, it's just the receipt from our first sale at the store.
Um, this is not nothing.
So, thank you.
I overheard someone wanted Mozzarella sticks for their birthday.
Pretty sure I scraped off all the freezer burn.
Wow.
Look at those.
Do you guys need anything else?
'Cause I'm just heading out so You know what, I have to go too.
I totally forgot.
I'm gonna take some to go.
Okay.
I should warn you, these don't travel well.
Even coming from the kitchen they lost a lot of shape.
Um, this is a very solid frame.
Thank you, I'm learning.
- Shall we?
- Mmm.
- What are you doing here?
- It's your graduation.
What do you think I'm doing here?
I was just taking pictures.
I just quit, I thought you wouldn't wanna come Let's try to find another word for 'quit.
' You know, it kinda implies poor management.
Besides you just, 'cause you've decided to move on, doesn't mean we can't still see each other, right?
Mhm.
Move down.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Thank you.
I'm really glad you're here.
Me too.
I'm gonna have to look at those photos before you share them or post them.
Yeah.
Of course.
Yeah.
No, I-I'm very sorry to tell you that we are all booked up tonight.
No room at the inn!
Yeah.
No, no.
I can imagine with that many kids and a grandmother, that it might be tough getting last-minute accommodations but Hello?
Hello?
Wow, isn't this a hot spot to be on a Friday night, huh?
Well, this is a big night, Roland.
- That's good.
- Waiting for our last guest.
He was supposed to be show up an hour ago.
Well, Johnny, I would love to sit and wait with you, but I've got a reservation, so if you could just give me my room key that'd be great.
- You have a reservation?
- Mhm.
Yeah.
Roland, we have a full house tonight, and I do not see your name down here.
Johnny, you'll find me under Damien Steele.
You're Damien Steele?
Shh!
Come on, I don't want the whole town to find out.
Roland, I've been waiting here all night for Damien Steele It's David's birthday, Alexis is graduating.
See Johnny, the mayor of the town can't use his real name to check into a love motel.
Yeah, it's not a love motel, Roland.
Oh, It will be tonight, my friend.
See, Jocelyn and I have a yearly tradition.
Every grad night we like to pretend to be other people - if you know what I mean.
- Yeah, you just told me what you mean.
Oh, we've been doing this ever since our own grad night.
If you catch my drift.
Yeah, I caught your drift when you told me what you mean.
So when Joce shows up and she says her name is Lisa Meriweather, just roll with it, okay?
Here is your key, Roland.
Okay.
Damien.
Congratulations, graduates, in honor of your achievement, we have an extra special surprise.
- Ted: Hm.
- Hm.
Okay.
I think we're good here.
Oh really?
She said, extra special.
I think we should stay.
Oohhh Tu, baroo, Tu baroo Sha la la, Ohhhh Tu, Tu, Tu, baroo Ohhhh, oohhhh Sha la la, Ohhhh, bop Baby I'm yours  And I'll be yours until The stars fall from the sky Yours until the rivers all run dry In other words, until I die  Baby I'm yours  And I'll be yours  Until the sun no longer shines  Well, that was a fun night.
I'm really glad I decided to invest in your business, David.
That is really lovely thing to say.
And I'm so glad you did, Patrick, because you've really helped to turn it into the success that it is.
Hmm.
A bold claim.
Thank you.
- For what?
- Um, I've never done that before with a guy.
Okay.
Yeah.
And uh,  I was getting a little scared that I was gonna let you leave here without us having done that.
So uh, thank you for um making that happen for us.
Well, um, fortunately, I'm an very generous person.
So Can we talk tomorrow?
Hm.
We can talk whenever you'd like.
Just preferably not before 10 a.m., Um, 'cause I'm not really a morning person.
Mhm.
Goodnight, David.
Goodnight, Patrick.
- Happy birthday, David.

That your Mother and me And Father and me Are so proud oooffff!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Jocelyn: Okay, Jazzigals, let's gather in for a warm up!
Okay!
Oh, before we start, I just wanna warn everybody, there is a murderer on the loose.
- In this town.
- Uh-oh.
So heads up, eyes peeled, guys.
Moira: Twyla, are you all right?
I will be if I can get a few friends together this weekend to catch this murderer.
Until then, it shall remain a mystery!
Oh, I think I know where this is going!
It's my murder mystery party this weekend.
Oh, I see!
Sorry if I scared anyone.
Jocelyn: I was scared you weren't gonna to have it this year!
John and I used to attend "Eyes Wide Shut" parties at the Castros'.
Though I'm guessing your evening's activities might be somewhat different.
I don't know, it can get pretty wild.
Oh yeah, you never know how the evening's gonna end!
Or when!
Well, John and I would love to help you ensnare this maniac, but we have plans this Saturday night.
Oh well, the party's actually Friday.
I had a 50/50 chance there.
So you can come?
Oh, I would be pleased to RSVP as pending.
Just uh, as soon as I double check, and circle back.
Mhmm.
Oh, this is gonna be so great!
1:00 P.M., terrific.
Yeah, looking forward.
Bye.
Did somebody book a room?
Even better, someone might book a room.
How is that better?
A lot of people might book a room if this goes through.
Okay, but you're still using the word "might".
That was the Elm Glen Golf Club.
They wanna put together a package with us.
A weekend of golf, and a stay at a luxurious motel.
What motel is that?
I'm gonna let them work out the verbiage, but the upshot is this, on a $250 dollar package, a cool $40 goes into our pockets.
That sounds like a better deal for them.
Well, it's all about building bridges, Stevie.
But here's the thing, even if this deal falls through, we still get an afternoon on a golf course!
"We"?
This is a big day for us, Stevie!
You know it's been three years since I've played a round of golf?
Yeah, um golf's not really my thing.
Except there was this one point in high school where I got this haircut that everyone said made me look like I was in the LPGA.
Well listen, I'm sure you could use an afternoon outdoors, okay?
Think of it as a team-building exercise.
Okay.
I might even let you drive the cart.
- Can you drink on the cart?
- Yeah.
Well, I will get the "back in 15 minutes" sign.
Well, it's gonna take longer than 15 minutes.
You have to give people hope.
So, Mrs. Rose, I don't mean to pressure you, but I am anxious to know Understandably, yes, BLT please, no bread.
Oh, I meant if you were coming to the murder mystery party.
Oh that, yes.
Yes, you are?
It's just that it's the end of the week Twyla, so that's always chockablock.
And then there are the kids Well, both of them, David, Alexis.
Well, I know you're busy, I was just-I don't know, I was just hoping you'd bring a little something to the party.
A touch of celebrity, perhaps.
- I was actually thinking bagel bites.
- Ah!
Did I mention it was a potluck?
Oh, you most certainly did not.
Well, I would ask someone else, it's just that uh, so far no one is coming.
No one's coming to your party?
Well, in fairness, the party is still a few hours away.
And some people did say that if another thing that's supposed to happen doesn't happen, then they might be able to come, so, that's good.
So as of now you have no one on your guest list?
Well, I shouldn't have said no one, My mom will come.
And she'll probably bring whoever she's dating.
And he'll most likely bring some younger friend.
Twyla, this is unacceptable!
There are myriad tactics to boost numbers at your party!
Well, you start by comping a few influential guests.
You'd be shocked at how many celebrities show up to a thing with the promise of a free Wagyu slider.
I-I'm not charging anyone, this is just for fun.
Oh, this is worse than I assumed!
How about a signature cocktail?
I hadn't thought of that.
- Okay, shouldn't you be - Oh, yeah.
Okay, we're going to start with follow-up.
You secure your VIP list, and you work your way down from there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Where's Stevie?
Um, I don't know, but she will be back in 15 minutes.
What are you doing?
I'm just checking the mail.
Did you know you can still get mail?
Yes, I know about mail.
No, but I'm talking about like, mail, mail.
Like a little man in a uniform, with his satchel full of letters, traveling door to door.
Um, that's a mailman.
And he comes to your house, you pay him, and he gives you your stuff.
I think it's free delivery, David.
- I don't think so - Mmm!
How far into the 15 minutes do you think we are?
Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but you've just been kind of hanging around a lot lately, - which isn't a bad thing, - Mhmm but it's also not a good thing.
Yeah, um it's just that the town only has so many ex-boyfriends to hand out secretary work.
Um, first of all, David, - I'm an assistant, not a secretary, - Oh.
And second of all, Ted is not my ex-boyfriend, he is ex-fiance.
And I'll have you know, that I might not be an assistant for much longer.
What is this?
- It's Elmdale College.
- Ooh.
Ted and I have been talking about me doing like, an accounting course, or an office management course, but I think I can maybe broaden my horizons a bit.
You've circled "Stars and Cosmology"?
Oh yeah, I thought it said "Cosmetology".
Ugh!
Can I just for a sec?
Here is Jocelyn's visor, and her glove.
Oh, uh, I don't think I'm gonna be playing, but thanks.
Okay, you know what, just in case you change your mind, why don't I show you a few pointers?
I can do it right here on Johnny.
Oh, I don't think so.
I mean, a few pointers couldn't hurt.
- Oh, I-I don't think that necessary.
- Here, come on, Jonathan.
- Okay, whoa.
- Come on down.
Right there, let me see your stance, what do you got goin' here?
Well, the set up is very important, Stevie.
Uh, legs so far apart, - knees slightly bent.
- Ooh!
Make sure you're nice and balanced over the ball.
Yeah, woo!
Johnny, I gotta tell you, you have a sensational stance.
Well, I've been golfing for 30 years, Roland.
Wow, I like that.
There's one thing I don't like about it, and let me show it to you.
I don't think I was asking.
Well, I think it's better that we show Stevie, than just talk about it, don't you?
Right, okay, so just first off, spread your legs just a little wider, if you would, for me.
- All right.
- There, see, Stevie?
They've gotta be like, sort of even with the shoulders, and if you would just pop the old tush Just go, Bam!
That's it, and now loosen up a little bit.
- Okay.
- Yeah!
All right, you know what, Roland, I think I should be showing you, because I don't really think you know what you're doing.
- Yes, right.
- Okay now, grip, very important.
- Yeah?
- Are you using the Vargon grip?
I'm using La Va Grande.
Are you watching this, Stevie?
Yeah, this is just a little hard to understand, so I want a record of it.
- Okay, delete that, please!
- Can I get a copy of that?
Yeah.
- Oh hi, Moira.
- Hi.
I thought that Roland might still be here.
No, it seems our mayor is keeping summer hours.
Gotcha.
Jocelyn it's really good to see you out and about.
Yes, I was starting to worry.
- Why?
- Well, I happened to be chatting with our dear little Twyla about her party tonight, and she mentioned that you have yet to RSVP?
And I thought, that's not the Jocelyn I know.
What must've felled her?
I'm fine, here's the thing.
These parties are not great.
Last year it went until 3 am, And Twyla just wandered around kind of winking at everybody, until she realized she hadn't picked a murderer.
And then the year before there were three murderers, and one of them actually robbed the cafe!
Well, I hear this year is going to be very different.
Twyla apparently sought counsel.
Expect thoughtful party favors, themed cocktails, first class catering.
I thought it was a potluck?
You, Jocelyn, are the mayor's wife, you are the self-appointed leader of the Jazzigals, and most importantly, Twyla worships you.
- She does?
- Yes.
This party has real momentum now.
And with you attached, it's no less than a snowball gathering speed, picking up bodies as it rolls downhill.
- And that's good?
- Very good.
Well, I guess I could talk to the other Jazzigals.
I just wish I hadn't thrown out that flapper dress from Halloween last year.
- Oh!
- Spread the word!
Be the snowball.
Be the snowball!
Okay, it's just that I misplaced my high school diploma when we lost our house.
No, I wish it was a flood.
Okay well, chasing down the paperwork seems like a lot of work.
No, I know that I know that your courses require a lot of work, I'm just what if it was a flood?
Okay fine, I will call you back with the paperwork, thanks.
Um, what's going on?
Are you looking at courses now?
Um, I'm just putting some feelers out.
A lot of people have encouraged me to build on the skills I acquired as creative director of the Blouse Barn, so.
Like who?
I thought it could be good for me.
Okay, well, this is sort of my thing, though.
I really don't think you can claim education as your thing, and I don't even think I'll be able to take those courses, because the stupid people at the college wouldn't just take my word for it when I told them that I had a high school diploma.
But why do you need it, though?
To prove that I graduated high school.
Well, it's not like they're gonna be like, "oh, you don't have your high school diploma, you can't come to our college".
That's almost word for word what they just said to me on the phone.
Well I just don't think I have that kind of time.
- Okay, what are you doing?
- Reorganizing my knits!
- Oh, there they are.
- Oh.
Mr. Rose, Ms. Budd.
Yes, please call me Johnny.
Always nice to put a face to the name.
Oh, I see you two came dressed for the occasion.
Always ready.
- I like your visor.
- Thanks, it's new.
So I hear there's quite a few new developments at your motel.
Uh, we'd love to hear about them, why don't we have a seat?
Oh, you wanna have the meeting inside?
On a day like this?
Sorry, did you think we'd be playing a round?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We-we had a meeting earlier at another club, and they wanted us to test drive the course, so we're in the attire.
Oh, where were you playing?
Uh, we were playing at um it was what course, Stevie?
It was down the road.
Uh, Maple - Grove?
- Grove, Maple Grove.
Maple Grove?
No, I don't know that one.
Oh, really?
It's a beautiful course.
Very exclusive, Uh, but it is set way back off the road, it's Which might explain why you've never seen - or heard of it.
- Yeah.
Johnny: So every room will have wi-fi, and upgraded beds, Uh, working toilets, which probably sounds like something I don't need to mention but you know, just covering all the bases.
Well, that sounds great.
Well, it's just that um We've been talking to the Elmington Moto-Lodge, and they've got coin laundry, and a Jacuzzi.
Well, we can certainly put in a Jacuzzi.
Yeah, Jacuzzis are very popular with our golfers.
Well, as an avid golfer myself, I can tell you that when you buy a golf package, you don't necessarily want to spend the entire weekend sitting in your room.
Well, thanks for coming by.
And definitely let us know when you've got that Jacuzzi.
Yes, we uh, we will.
I guess that's all, that's it now, thanks.
Yeah, well, listen, it's uh still early, do you guys have any other plans this afternoon?
We have another meeting.
Oh well, you know what they say, too much work  - Well, thanks for coming in.
- Okay.
You go on ahead, I'm just gonna go use the restroom.
Oh sure, might as well use some of the amenities.
Hey.
Um, you know those courses we were talking about?
Oh yeah, I thought that data management one looked like it might be good for you.
Mhmm, yeah, I had the same thought, but when I looked into it, all the courses were full.
And then the courses that weren't full conflicted with each other, and then everything just canceled out.
Alexis, if you don't wanna take the course, you don't have to take the course.
No, there were courses that did look very interesting.
Um, it's just kind of complicated.
Yeah, but it's so worth it.
Sometimes I wish I could go back to college.
Pub nights, frisbee in the quad - Hmm!
- Late night hacky sack.
Mhmm.
We got some serious sack circles going.
Oh, so many sex circles.
Sack.
Hacky sack.
We always hoped they'd lead to sex, but still.
College, so crazy.
So crazy.
Um Okay, the thing is I can't go to college, yet.
Because I didn't finish high school.
- Oh.
- I know.
It's so embarrassing, and I never should've taken that semester off.
But I did meet Beyonce in Mykonos, so it was almost worth it.
Didn't you say on your resume that you did four years at UCLA?
Yes technically, if you consider Bel Air an extension of the campus, which everybody does.
This might sound crazy, but I almost think I should finish high school.
That doesn't sound crazy at all.
And truth be told, it took me a minute to finish high school myself.
You're only saying that to make me feel better.
No, no, me and some friends, we just got in a car, and took off.
- Really?
Yeah, we were following the American Idol tour.
We missed a couple shows, but it's always the exact same set, so no regrets.
Um, I really wish you hadn't told me that last little bit, but thank you.
That makes two of us.
- Good round?
- Not bad.
Greens are a little fast, but I like that.
Me too.
I've given a heads-up to the starter.
The tee is yours.
- Have a great round, you two.
- Thanks so much.
How did you make that happen?
I asked.
Well, that's very nice, Stevie!
Thank you.
Okay, let's get our golf sticks.
David, and why am I not surprised to see you in here?
Well, this is my room.
Well, it's disheartening to see you like this.
Did you know that according to IMDB, Rosa Parks was in an episode of "Touched By an Angel"?
Exactly, David.
You are bored, lethargic, and practically dripping with ennui!
Okay, that's a bit much.
I blame myself.
I've set a standard of activity and engagement so high you don't even try.
Okay, I am on a much needed respite whilst in between jobs.
You are squandering your social capital.
A taste-maker like you should be out there, tasting things!
Uh, I'm at the buffet, and there is nothing to taste!
Well, there's a party tonight, as a matter of fact.
- The murder mystery thing?
- Why not?
Does this town not deserve to have a marquee guest like yourself grace their humble soiree?
Speaking of marquee guests, I'm surprised you're going.
I can understand why you'd say that, but don't you just know Twyla would be thrilled to have as many Roses there tonight as possible!
Fine, I will make a surprise appearance.
- Good.
- But it's twice around the room, - and then I'm out.
- Is there any other way?
Oh, and it's Roaring Twenties themed, and I know you have a soft spot for seersucker.
- I won't be dressing up.
- Aw, say, don't be a dew-dropper!
Throw some concealer under those peepers, make like a swell, and go put on the Ritz!
- Woo.
- Good golf shot!
Thank you, Stevie.
Ah    - Oh!
John, are you going to be done soon?
Just working on my short game, Moira.
Stevie and I are pitching Oak Valley next week, I just wanna make sure I'm ready.
Well, the endless tinking of putter to ball tells me you will be.
Well, it's for the motel.
It's not like I'm enjoying this.
- Ohhhh!
Beautiful, see that?
- Ahem!
Rose residence.
Uh, where are you?
!
May I ask who's calling?
You know who this is, and you know where I am.
Did everyone show up?
Yes, everybody showed up.
Good, then my work is done.
Uh no, your job is not done, You guilted me into coming here tonight!
And you're better off for it, David.
You should thank me.
Twyla was set to throw a fiasco until I exerted my influence.
Uh yeah, and the way Twyla keeps asking about where you are, I'm pretty sure you're the murderer.
They'll never catch me.
Ugh!
Who was that?
I don't know.
because we trusted you!
That school cost $250,000 dollars!
I know, and I felt so bad about it.
And that is why I missed my final semester.
Wait a minute, we were at the graduation!
- Yeah!
- I know, but I wasn't.
We saw you there!
- Did we, though?
- Yeah.
We were there, we might not have stayed through the "R's," I think we left halfway through the "L's".
Oh, yeah, it got very repetitive.
No, I distinctly remember a celebratory lunch at the Hotel de Ville, in Crissier, and you'd had that unfortunate run-in with the spray tan machine.
- Uh-uh.
- No, that was-that was me.
Ah!
Yeah!
Then how do you explain this graduation photo?
Huh?
That's Jess Chang!
- What?
Jess Chang?
- Ugh!
Well, who can tell with all this hair in front of your face?
That's not my face!
Okay, why didn't anyone come to my graduation?
Well, you didn't graduate in Switzerland.
And whose fault is that?
!
How long have you been carrying that around in your wallet?
