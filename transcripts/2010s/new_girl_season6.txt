{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 Jess, why couldn't you marry me?
Oh, I don't know.
- You know.
- No, I-I don't know.
It's Nick.
I love you.
- You love me?
- I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow, that feels so good to say.
I now pronounce you husband and  - I'm booking a ticket.
- A ticket?
Yeah, Reagan is going to New Orleans for work for three months and she asked me to go with her.
And I'm gonna do it.
- Damn it!
- This is an alert?
I did not need to know that the Riblet sandwich is back.
How long does it take to respond to a house offer?
Breathe, okay?
We will find out about the house when we find out about the house.
- You're right.
- All right.
- You're right.
Okay.
- We're fine.
We're fine.
- We're fine, we're fine.
-  - I'm so excited!
- We're finally getting a house!
As I was saying, I never felt love like this.
I really miss your lips on mine.
Babe, it's just a two month FBI training program.
I had a major breakthrough this week.
I perfected my "keep vamping, we've almost traced the call" gesture.
Oh, wow, really?
Well, you know, we've had some breakthroughs of our own over here, too.
You know, I got to say, your sister is really coming into her own as a real estate agent.
In fact, I think she may have found a house for Schmidt and Cece.
That's amazing!
Oh, thank you so much for looking out for Leslie.
It means the world to me.
Well, would you describe yourself as, I don't know, owing me?
'Cause I will take my repayment in the form of  What the hell is that noise?
Jess?
For Pete's sake.
What is that infernal racket?
Hey, I was just making some table legs.
But if it's too loud, I can table them for later.
This whole summer, you've been doing one activity after another.
The urban corn harvest.
Learning Portuguese.
You joined that SoulShred gym and got scary ripped.
Oh.
What is going on with you?
Okay.
All right.
She's a badass, that is what is going on with her.
Woodworking is awesome.
Okay, woodworking is insane.
- It's woodturning, but go on.
- Honey, do you think that any of these hobbies have anything to do with With Nick?
Nicholas Miller?
- That ole turkey burger?
- Yeah.
He's in New Orleans with his perfect girlfriend.
- And I'm fine.
- Okay.
Actually, I'm doing great.
- Okay.
- : I moved past him.
I-I-I'm over him.
Just checking.
- I'm moving forward.
- Cool.
Or as they say in Portuguese, Empurrando para a frente.
Which technically means "thrusting forward".
It's a very sexual language.
Honey.
- We got the house.
-  We got the house!
Leslie, I can't believe you pulled this off.
Every morning I just Google "house" and sometimes stuff comes up.
Guys, look at us.
You guys are married.
Winston, you're in love, Nick's in a serious relationship of his own, and I am a truly excellent friend.
Why are you looking at my house?
Hello, sir, how are you?
We're the ones who are buying your home.
I'm not selling my house.
What?
Oh, maybe that's why there's no sign.
Maybe I got the address wrong.
I mean What are you ta how did we get into the house?
- We walked through it three times.
- What?
- What?
- What?
Oh that's a mistake.
- Why would you do that?
-  Oh!
He's got a bat!
Oh, my God, the car's the other way!
I'm sorry, sir.
All right, I'm taking charge.
- Winston, Leslie has to go.
- No!
She's the worst real estate agent of all time.
Aly and I just went long distance.
I can't tell her that you fired her little sister.
This is a delicate situation for our relationship.
Please, Jess.
Why are you ask why are you asking Jess?
And, Jess, why are you inserting yourself into this?
If anyone's inserting themself, it's Winston.
He's like a tongue at a seventh grade birthday party.
Okay, look, fine, can I at least be the one to break the news to her?
Yes, you may.
Thank you, Jess.
- It is so great to know.
- Yeah.
- who your real friends are.
- Yeah.
- Get off the sofa.
- Yeah.
Go check on your cat.
Look, we'll find a place, okay?
I didn't like that house that much anyway.
I just can't be married, living with roommates.
Well, hey!
Well, I hope you saved some for Furguson.
: 'Cause you forgot yesterday.
- No!
-   No!
Look at our wedding photo.
I want to hang our wedding photo in our house.
- I want to start our lives together.
- I know.
Guys, we are in this together.
We're just gonna have to find a house ourselves.
I need a project now that my table's almost done.
I'll be your real estate agent.
I've already found, like, five open houses today.
Like, this one is a fixer-upper, but don't judge a house by its smoke damage.
Okay, babe, this was a crime scene.
Yeah, but that was months ago.
And it was drug thing, so there are no ghosts.
- That's not how ghosts work.
- This is in your price range, and it's, like, only five minutes from the loft.
I really think this is the best investment of our money right now.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
Hey, babe?
- I think we got this, okay?
- Yes.
We got this.
Actually, we, we got this.
Preach!
We got this.
Jess, look at us for a second, the two of us, Cece and I. We.
Us.
We got this.
- We got this.
- : All right.
Schmidt, bedrooms.
Cece, bathrooms.
I'm gonna smell everything.
Bonjour!
Crawdaddy's home, and he's ready to see his crawkids!
Who's home?
Schmidty, Jess?
Winston?
Winston's cat?
Fine.
Cece?
The en suite is en fleek.
I love this house, too.
I poked my head in the shower.
Perfect, gentle, unrelenting pressure.
Like when my mom made me rehearse my haftarah portion.
I don't know, guys.
Lot of lost dog posters around.
Really sad neighborhood.
Also it's crazy expensive.
I'm the voice of reason, that's why you brought me with.
We-we didn't bring you with.
- You followed us here in your car.
- Okay.
- She followed us the whole way.
- I know, I know.
Cece, I'm begging you, please tell her to go home.
Yeah, I know.
We need to start setting some boundaries.
You know what, though?
She's not wrong.
This place is way over our borrowing limit.
Damn it.
The only place that was even close was that  Carpet house.
All right.
We will ask for a bigger loan.
And It'll be tight, but we'll manage it.
Okay.
Yeah, we can do it.
- Look, we'll just make sacrifices.
- Yeah.
We'll pack our lunches.
We'll cut out cup-on's.
- It's coupons.
- Cup-ons, yeah.
- No, you're saying cup-ons.
- Well, it's fine.
It's not important, we'll cut out cup-ons.
Coupons.
But if we're gonna do this, we're gonna have to go to the bank now because this house is gonna go like this, I know it.
Why is she talking to the realtor?
I will handle it, okay?
It's-it's tot it's Oh.
Jess?
I'm so sorry, do you mind if I just steal her away for a minute?
Jessica?
Hey, honey, this can't happen.
You're right, this is not your house.
- Toni-Anne, we're walking!
- No, no.
You being here.
You taking over as our real estate agent because you can't stop thinking about Nick.
Cece, not everything's about Nick.
Curvando diante da face errada.
In Portuguese, "You're bending before the wrong face".
Again, very sexual language.
You know I love you and I will always be there for you in an emergency, but Schmidt and I need to do this by ourselves.
You got to go home.
Okay.
I got it.
Okay.
You guys are moving forward, You don't need ol' Jess the Mess.
I'm gonna go home.
But seriously, I crawled under the house and the retrofitting is rookie work.
Okay.
She going home?
- Yeah, let's go to the bank.
- Let's do it.
You know what, actually, I just want to use the cooktop first.
- Make an egg.
- Honey, where are you gonna get an egg?
Got two eggs right here.
Got a pan right here.
Think I'm gonna buy a house and not make an egg first?
And I'm a Sagittarius, which is why I'm so good with people and horses.
But it also makes me, like, really sleepy.
Uh, Leslie  Um, there's no there's no easy way to say this.
Uh you no longer work for Schmidt and Cece.
No, no, they're firing me?
No, but didn't you tell them how good I am?
Well, you know, I tried to.
I was like, I was like, "Man, she good" You didn't stick up for me, Winston?
- Well, I tried - I'm calling Aly!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, no, no, time out, time out.
Listen, hey, hey, hey.
Time out.
Stop.
Stop that.
You didn't let me finish.
You don't work for Schmidt and Cece anymore, because 'Cause you work for me now.
- I'm buying a house.
-  - I'm buying a house!
-  Ha, ha!
I'm buying a home.
We do not look great on paper.
Please, on paper, we're as ugly as Winston's bellybutton ring.
Who gets a bellybutton ring if you have an outie?
And at 33, no less.
But trust me, loan officers have a lot of discretion.
We just need to market ourselves.
We need to look him right in the eye Mr. Schmidt and Mrs. Parikh?
I'm not blind.
I just had my pupils dilated for an exam.
If it makes you feel any better, I'm seeing stars, too.
What?
I'm talking about you.
Okay, honey, just shh.
Shh.
You're a big, bright star.
It ain't gonna be that kind of party today, pal.
Follow me.
NICK : Hey, Crawdaddy's home!
I had a whole crawdaddy thing, but I the point is, I'm home.
Hey, Nick.
You weren't supposed to be home for, like, a month.
Are you guys doing okay?
Yeah, uh, Reagan's drug company is moving her up to Seattle - Okay.
- so we're doing the distance thing.
Yeah, we're doing great.
You know what they call Seattle in Portland?
North Portland.
Or, uh, Vancouver's Shoe.
What?
Vancouver's Shoe.
Get in here!
Give me a hug!
Okay.
All right!
Wow, look at you.
You got jacked.
Yeah.
What, did you go to prison?
-  -  No.
- I worked out a lot.
- Come on, sit down.
I haven't seen you in months.
I need some Jess.
I also have something very important to tell you.
- Is everything okay?
- Um I have to, um It's just, I have to meet my friend.
I mean, I have to go to the zoo.
The zoo?
You hate zoos.
Um, I was supposed to meet her in the lemur section of the parking lot like ten minutes ago, so What friend?
Why?
Deedee.
I have to meet Deedee.
She's, like, a good friend.
"Deedee"?
That's not a name.
You have one friend.
It's Cece.
This sounds fishy.
Yeah, no.
We can't loan you any more money.
JESS : Cece!
Oh.
Okay.
What?
No, I I-I know what this is about.
I'll just be a moment.
- You know what what's - Thank you.
Ce ce What's happening?
What is happening?
- Jessica - You said "emergency".
Well, this is an emergency.
Nick is home.
What is your emergency?
Don't glory in it, Cece.
Please don't mistake my measured bank tone for calmness, as I am filled with the waters of rage.
Jess, I know that you've come here to convince Cece that she shouldn't buy this house.
- No.
- Babe, this is an emergency.
I have feelings for Nick again, okay?
There.
I said it.
I saw him for one second and I freaked out.
I told him I was going to the zoo.
You hate the zoo.
There's something about him.
I see him and my heart explodes.
We all need to meet new people.
Oh -  - Where are we?
Your new hood!
Okay, so, I couldn't check all the boxes, but I think nailed the most important one: That it can float.
That's a that's a boat.
Yeah.
I was just driving to my doctor's office last night and I saw it.
And you thought, "Okay".
Where-where's your doctor's office?
Three boats down.
Should we call Aly and tell her the good news?
I had no idea you were going through this.
I can't even be in the same room as Nick.
I don't know what I'm saying and what if I say something that ruins our friendship?
Get out.
- What?
- Get out.
Get out right now.
Get out instantly.
- What?
- What happened to the "I'm so sorry"?
Nick is on his way to the bank right now.
I texted him.
I need his help with the loan.
- What?
- What?
We need to put the bar up for collateral, okay?
We're miles past our borrowing limit.
It's the only way.
Yeah, but the bar?
- No time.
There he is.
- What?
Hey, Nick!
Ah!
Just pretend like we're having a normal conversation.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Um This is, um, this is Margaret.
This is Gracie.
Oh.
No.
You think I Oh, no.
I'm not a bank robber.
Stop reaching for that button.
I'm just trying to avoid my ex.
Oh, thank God.
God, I missed you.
You know, I slept in your bed twice.
Look at your hair, you hippie.
Yeah, just come over here!
Great!
Um, oh.
Uh, heads up.
There are over 60 pairs of shoes in your room.
Uh, heads up, they're all in the hallway now.
Oh, okay.
Sir, sorry to keep you waiting.
This is my co-signer.
Point me in any direction and I'll sign.
So this is the place, eh?
Beautiful picture of it.
That's how much it is?
That's really exp Schmidty, are you sure you know what you're getting us into?
Yeah, man.
All right.
-  - Congrats.
Did we get the loan?
I wish it were up to me, because the answer would be "no" and all of this would be over.
He's been a buzzkill all day.
Yeah.
That's all right.
I owe you one American dream  - You sweet angel.
- We did it!
I'm so happy for you guys.
Hey, I gotta go.
-  - I got it.
Beautiful family.
It's okay, it's okay.
This is stupid.
I can't keep hiding from him.
- Jess, just give me a sec, okay?
- No, Cece Cece, it's fine.
I'll come back with you.
Go go with Jess now.
No, no, no, no.
I have to do this myself.
And you guys have to buy a house.
This is good; This is you moving forward.
- Thanks, Jess.
- Get in here.
Oh, I love you guys.
- Okay.
-  Oh Oh, my God.
Lost my breath, there.
She's a strong strong one.
Well, you're getting the loan.
What?
Interest rates are about to drop and we want to settle you with a high one before they do, so - We got the loan?
- We can make an offer?
: It doesn't make a lick of sense to me, but there you go.
So many zeros.
That's a lot of zeros.
What are you doing?
Hella?
Are you buying a boat?
Look, it is a complicated situation.
First off, I think your sister is amazing.
Secondly, I know that we just went long-distance and I don't want to give you any bad news, but your sister ain't that good at her job.
Like, at all.
She's uh, dumb.
That girl is the trunk of a tree.
Ain't nobody at home up here.
- Okay, you - She a cottonhead!
- Easy - This girl is a dumped-out sewing kit.
Easy.
She talkin', but ain't nobody listenin'.
Easy.
That's my sister.
And I know she's an idiot.
Thank God.
Just because we're long-distance doesn't mean we can't be real with each other.
Okay?
We have to tell each other everything.
I don't know what the word "panache" means.
It means having a certain kind of flair.
That All right, I'm gonna hang up now.
Are you ready?
Of course I'm ready.
Aly loves Winston Winston loves Aly We're both hanging up now We're hanging up on the count of a hundred Okay, babe.
Love you.
And a one, two, Gotta go, bye.
Three Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Love you.
You okay, Jess?
Yeah, it's just something I have to handle on my own.
No such thing.
I'm standing right here.
Lay it on me.
Okay.
But it's pretty major.
Do you think you can handle it?
Yes.
N No.
I jumped the gun.
I should've said I don't I don't know.
Here goes.
Um So Nick's back.
Ooh, don't I know it!
Don't I know it!
Nick is back!
You know, maybe I can't handle it.
I haven't even gotten to the major part yet.
Oh.
What I'm trying to say is I'm not over Nick.
Oh Ooh Mm.
Oh!
Oh I know.
Hm mm?
Oh And you guys are all moving on.
And I'm still here, where I was, waiting outside Nick's door, trying to figure out how to talk to him without having a heart attack.
Okay.
Okay, listen.
You can't control who you panache.
Just a quick check-in: How am I handling this?
Bizarrely but it's kind of working.
Okay.
I have to figure out how to be friends with him again but I can't even bring bring myself to knock on his door.
Well, that's okay, Jess, because I'm here.
-  -  Yeah?
Uh, Nick, question: Um, do you have another gator tooth?
I seem to have swallowed mine.
I've given you a lot of gator teeth.
This is the last one.
And stop putting stuff in your mouth.
I will make no such promise.
Hey, Day.
Hey, Miller.
Well, Bish out.
For the third time in my life, I have to call off a boat purchase.

- So I just want to - How was the zoo?
- Oh.
Sorry.
- You go, you go first.
Oh, I just How was New Orleans?
How-how was everything?
It was great.
I came alive in that city, Jess.
I was writing 2,000 pages a day by hand.
- What?
- By hand.
Yes.
Unfortunately, it all blew into the Mississippi River.
Oh, my God, no.
That's terrible.
I mean, for you and for the environment And I had to start over, so I invested in a computer I bought the heaviest one I could find and look heavy computers, heavy materiel.
This is my first book.
- What?
- Yeah.
This is what I wanted to tell you.
Oh, my God.
: It's my book!
Nick, how many days did it take to print this out?
About a week.
I had to go to a car rental place at night, but, uh read the first page.
"To Anthony Rizzo and the Chicago Cubs, for all we've been through".
"And to my friend Jessica Day for the same thing".
I don't know if you remember this, but, uh you were the one who told me to go to New Orleans.

I smell coyote babies.
The other house was just too expensive.
Yeah, this place is actually perfect.
Or at least it will be, once we redo it.
This whole room could be mid-century.
You could use the crown molding as a focal point.
I'm sorry.
I'm inserting.

Look, we clearly are gonna need everyone's help on this.
Oh, thank you, God!
Okay.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 This loft has devolved into chaos.
You promised me if we had sex this morning, you wouldn't get riled up.
Sex was great.
Blessings.
But look at all this mail.
Small-time drug dealers are more organized than this.
Oh, my God, my uncle Lee got married.
This is what I'm talking about.
Oh, my God, he died.
Cece, what if that had been one of your college acceptance letters?
I'm transferring to a four year university.
It's no big deal.
It's huge.
You graduated from a community college.
It was a sight to behold.
- Cece Parikh.
- That's me.
-  - Yay!
I'm not gonna let you lose out because our roommates are a bunch of railway cats.
Clear your schedule.
We're organizing.
Can't.
I'm campaigning with Jess today.
Let's get ready to Rodham!
Y'all ready for this election?
-  - What on Earth are you celebrating?
It's okay.
We know you're voting for Trump.
Not on your life, nor am I voting for that flip-flopping helmet head in a pantsuit.
I'm only focused on one election.
The election that matters: Paul Ryan 2020.
All right.
While you sit this one out, Cece and I are gonna register new voters and help Hillary prove that a woman's place is in the house  The White House.
The people's voice must be heard and that's what I've always believed.
As I see it, we have two choices.
Continue eating this pig slop that they call butterscotch pudding or we can raise our voices and demand for locally-sourced, candied, Oregon apples!
You can silence me, but you can't silence the people!
This is not P.S. Hippie Montessori.
Nobody cares anymore.
Democracy is dead.
Wha If you get five new voters, hell, you know what, I'll vote for Hillary.
Excuse me?
Things just got interesting.
But if you don't, you have to vote for Winston.
Bishop?
Winston Bishop?
Game on, you Republican minx.
Hey, guys, if I win, I just want you to know there will be some things that come out about me.
Just ride it out.
Reagan's in Seattle.
Aly's at Quantico.
And here we are, you and me, working that long "D".
The long what now?
We're working the what?
The long "D".
Long distance relationships.
I mean, Aly and I have got it down to an art.
Really?
'Cause I'm I'm really struggling.
In New Orleans, Reagan and I had such an easy time talking, but now there's so much pressure that we just text.
Just talk on the phone.
I hate talking on the phone, Winston.
I feel like I'm exposing my turd pipe.
- What?
- I just know that I feel cold - and I'm terrified.
- Look, man you got to understand something about the long "D".
At first, it's very hard.
Okay?
It's a lot to take.
But the long "D" in the end is  very much worth it.
You have to see what you're doing here.
Right now you're having problems.
I'm not.
You know why?
'Cause you love the long "D".
I've adjusted to the long "D".
- Okay.
- Sometimes it's rough.
Yeah, can be bumpy road sometimes, man.
The long "D" can be bumpy.
- Ooh!
- Sometimes there's unexpected curves.
- Don't I know it.
- But once it breaks you down a little bit, you learn to like the long "D".
You're gonna say something like that?
You get used to it is what I'm saying.
I think I'm done with this.
Hello.
Hello.
Two canvassers reporting for duty.
Jessica Day, school administrator.
Cecilia Parikh, community college graduate, soon to be transferred to a four year university.
I don't have time for this.
Well, actually She doesn't know which one yet.
Yeah, I haven't been accepted.
I don't have time to listen to you.
Sure.
Oh, no.
Just be respectful, informative.
Hillary Clinton was born in 1947 and her parents are Hugh and Dorothy.
Woman won a Grammy.
That's a fact.
Takes a village.
Try phone duty.
Great.
Quick question.
I've perfected five different, assertive, female voices.
You tell me which one you'd like me to use.
: Hi.
: Hey.
Hello.
: Good day.
: 'Sup.
That was one.
What is so genius about the new system is that it's completely self-explanatory.
Now, let's say you get a heating bill.
- Where does it go?
- Oh.
Didn't know I was gonna be quizzed.
Loft bills.
That's right.
And do not put that in the old mail, soy sauce, dead battery drawer.
Wh What?
What?
What is this drawer?
Take me to the drawer, Winston.
Where is it?
I didn't The hell is this?
Uh some some of everything.
When you cut the belly open of a shark and just everything topples out.
Have you people all just given up?
Well, hang on.
It's Cal State L.A.
This is Cece's first admissions letter.
- Oh.
- I got to get this to her.
Winston!
I hope you're happy!
I showed her my turd pipe.
I don't know what's going on in your lives, but we need to start eating dinner together again.
Mm-mm.
Oh.
You got in my head.
I decided to call Reagan and it went horribly.
Hi, this is Nick.
Yeah, Nick Miller, boyfriend.
Boyfriend.
: What you got?
Why am I talking this way?
Hi.
Talking, me talking.
You listening, you listening.
Next thing I knew, I was saying the words "phone" and "sex" and now she expects phone sex.
- Nick, relax, man.
- Help me.
I'm screwed, Winston.
I'm gonna lose her.
My friend, you are not gonna lose her, okay?
Phone sex is old school.
That's how our nanas got nasty.
True, true, true.
They'd be like, "What you wearing, Gertrude"?
She'd be like, "My bloom bloomers.
Pull down those trousers and let me see that thing".
But thanks to technology, hmm, there's plenty other ways you can get sensual with your lady.
Welcome to the Winston Bishop Clinic for Satellite Sexual Intercourse.
Eh?
This is how you do phone sex?
Video sex, Nick.
Aloha.

- Mm On envelopes.
Really?
Ugh.
We are not making a damn diff in here, Cece.
Stuffing paper.
If ten-year-old Jess could see me now You know, she'd be really proud of your knockers.
I never saw that coming.
Well, that's a fair point.
I did exceed expectations.
- Mm.
- But you know what?
We need to get off the bench and we need to go prove Schmidt wrong.
So, we need a list of potential new voters and I know just the tired, cranky broad who has one.
Hey.
Thought you could use a hot cup.
So, when the dust settles, what's, uh what's next for the supervisor?
My name is Mary Ellen and I haven't thought about myself in weeks.
Oh, well, best of luck.
Piece of cake, Cece.
Sign up five new voters.
We'll be done by noon.
Yes!
Yes!
Hi, do you have a minute to talk about Hillary?
I'm voting for her.
Would you like to Hillary Cli Yes?
-  - You know who you look like?
I am not Bernie Sanders.
I am Marshall Stevens and for the last year and a half, my life has been a living hell!
-  - Okay.
So, this is what all the kids are talking about these days?
- Yep.
Yeah.
- Video sex?
Do you clean this thing regularly?
I thi - Why are you looking up?
-  That's her.
She wants to do it now.
I like her style.
A little afternoon delight.
Yeah.
Okay, let's pick out a backdrop.
Where do you want to get naughty?
Paris?
Rome?
- Huh?
Drink a little tea?
- That's not sexy.
Afric nah, you don't want to Outer space?
You can do it in space?
Oh, yes, Nick.
You can.
And you will.
Wait.
This is a sorority house.
It's probably a house full of unregistered voters.
I hear you, I do, but there's nothing scarier to me than sorority girls.
Hey, you got the keg?
'Cause we're almost tapped and I'm like, "What"?
Um, are you ladies planning to vote?
Yeah, bye.
- Is she gone?
-  I stood frozen like you're supposed to when you see a bear in the woods.
Hold on a sec.
Hey, babe.
Where are you?
I'm I'm at the Phish concert that you call a campaign office.
And I have your first admissions letter!
We're just actually out canvassing right now.
I'll open it when I get home.
That's not gonna work for me.
I'm gonna open it now.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, don't Sorry.
I can't hear you over the sound of me opening it.
You got into college!
You got into college!
I got into college.
- You got into college?
-  Cece got into college.
Congratulations.
Ah, whatever.
: Don't tell Schmidt we haven't gotten any new voters.
- Tell Jess that I'm not surprised, - Okay.
And her whispers are like screams.
- Hey!
- Whoa.
All right.
The day's not done.
Money and special interests, Jess.
Let me hear you say it: democracy is dead.
Democracy is alive.
He got where I was going.
Whew.
Let's find you a home.
Thank you.
Oh.
Uh, we lost a couple of deadbeats over in envelopes.
We need you there.
I'm not one of you people.
I'm very sorry.
I'm a Repu Hmm.
I'm repulsed by that garbage dump you call an envelope station.
Great.
Then organize it.
No.
: I'm-a make a system.
I couldn't see the smug look on Schmidt's face, but I could feel it.
I'll be damned if I cast a vote for Bishop-Furguson.
Wait, where-where are you going?
Back to the coven of Greek sirens.
I say we go in hard, with the violent history of the suffragette, and then, we ease into some light reproductive rights.
That is one way to do it.
Or Who's ready to party?
And gab about the kind of world we want to leave our grandchildren!
Hopefully one that's full of parties!
You're gonna graduate soon, okay?
So, this is your turn to really speak up - and make a difference - And it's your turn to drink!
Oh, okay.
All right, just, um, okay I love you, booze girl.
Take a shot!
- Oh, no.
I don't - Shot!
I don't want to take a shot, but I do want you to sign up to vote.
I can't sign it if you don't take a shot.
That's such a good argument.
Okay.
Oh All right.
You all have ten shots and I have one.
But, if you share the wealth, then we can all throw up together.
And that's called redistribution.
-  - That's what I'm saying!
Ah, you're welcome!
: Booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl, booze girl Oh, bingo.
I feel sexy.
Can I, uh, practice some sex talk I've been working on?
Pretend you're Reagan.
Take off your space pants, I want to do sex with you over this video thing.
Don't overthink it.
Okay I can't see anything in here, but - here goes nothing.
-  In ten hours, I'll be dead.
I'm headed straight to the sun, which is actually a star.
But it's our star.
And it's worth saving.
Nick?
Anyway here's my penis.

Ivana Getsum.
Ah, hell.
Jessica damn Day.
All of those names are fake.
What a freaking buzz kill.
You didn't see that when they wrote it down there?
- You're so great, let me look at yours.
- You check your facts.
Check - Check it.
- Melanie Fart signed yours five times.
Who wrote Melanie Fart?
They think ma-democracy's a joke!
- Democracy's not a joke!
- No.
It's the system by which we live!
Ladies!
I'm yelling from a balcony!
Your female forebears fought to give you a voice.
One of them threw herself in front of a horse.
A horse!
Jess, come down, okay?
You're drunk, they're all drunk.
I'm drunk.
We lost the bet.
This is not about the bet, this is about America!
Here we go.
Now, you ladies can sit on the sidelines and let someone else dictate your futures, or you can speak up and take charge of your lives.
Now, if you're not willing to do that, then shame on you.
But if you are, then I want to hear your voice.
Where are you Ivana Getsum?
How about-how about you, Anita Wang?
Show your face, Melanie Fart.
Where you at?
Are you serious?
We had a real moment.
How about, um Babaloo Softlock?

Burt Tacomeat?
Jackie Rectum?
Boobs Gargler?
Diaria Jones?
Oprahs' friend Gayle?
Yaseen Maboobs?

ALL : Booze girl!
Booze girl!
Booze girl!
Booze girl!
Booze girl!
All right, now I need your real signatures!
The forms are all filled up.
Well, then let's march to the headquarters!
Hey, buddy, we doing all right?
Yeah, never better.
Aly saw my ass in space, Reagan still wants to have phone sex with me, and I just panic-ordered $200 worth of Chinese food.
You know what, man?
That's on me, I I pushed you to use my style when I should have encouraged you to use your own.
Winston, if I had any style, I would call my girlfriend instead of using my best friend's electronic sex shed.
"Every moment you're on this Earth, is a moment I know where you are".
You know who wrote that?
The great James Baldwin.
No, you wr James Baldwin?
What?
Look, man, you sent me these cards when I was playing basketball in Latvia.
And, I don't know, I kept all of them.
They're beautiful, man.
"I screamed your name at the ocean today, then I ate a sandwich that tasted like your smile".
I wrote that to you?
Yeah.
Boy, we used to be a lot closer.
This is your style, man.
Use it.
Thank you.
Hey, uh, Reagan, this is Nick Miller.
You said you wanted phone sex, so, here you go.
Here's your phone sex.
Get ready to, uh, have a an orgasm, I guess.
When I'm done with, uh I'll just start.
You are a real sandwich lady, and I want to scream your name across the ocean.
Ooh, hoo!
That's nice.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's that's Winston.
Yeah, he's in here to help, he's actually been very helpful.
- What's up, girl?
- He says "What's up, girl"?
Oh, yeah, I'll def Yeah, makes perfect sense.
You need to leave right now.
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Bye, Reagan.
No, Winston, I mean it.
She brings up a valid point.
- We're about to do phone sex, and - I'm walking out All right, Winston, take off.
- Sure.
For sure.
- No, Winston, I mean it.
This is me telling you as Nick.
- I would like you to leave.
- As Nick.
Ooh!
Hit the road.
- Oh, for real?
- Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
- All right, then.
Oh, hey, hey, before I go, it may be bad timing, but you want to grab brunch with my boy Willy tomorrow?
No.
I'll talk to you later.
- I don't want to.
- You'll change your mind.
This is awesome.
I hope we get to meet Ivanka.
I love her shoes.
Ivanka?
Yeah, Donald's daughter.
We all love her.
And we love the Donald!
Trump!
Oh, okay, what do we do?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Turn right!
Right, run!
- Right, right.
- Whoo!
You can register online.
Democracy lives!
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Are we going in the right direction?
Doesn't matter.
Keep running.
I mean, you helped those girls find their voice, you know, it just wasn't the one that you wanted.
You helped me find my voice, too.
I'm not sure you're gonna want to hear that one either.
- What do you mean?
- I don't want to go to college.
- What?
- When Schmidt opened my letter, I could hear the excitement in his voice, and I could see it in your face, but - Cece - I felt nothing.
Schmidt, please talk some sense to your wife.
She says she doesn't want to go to college, but tell her that a four-year education No, okay, look, Jess, Jess, I know school is your life, okay, and I respect that, you know that I do, but we're different people.
I don't want to be stuck in a classroom.
I want to be out in the world working with people.
I just really need you both to support me.
I support you.
I will always support you.
I mean, this sort of ruins my dream of taking you in a dorm room, but A dorm room?
Did you think I was gonna move out?
- I thought - Cece I want what's best for you, so if this is what you want It is.
Trust me.
Booze girl loves you.
Oh, I love you, booze girl.
I love you, too.
- What?
- What is this?
This is a memento from a dark period.
Hey, Winston, I lost the bet.
I'm gonna be voting for you.
And I'm scared to ask, what is your platform?
Well, first of all, I just want to say that my portrait, it will be silly.
And I will change the national anthem to something like this.
: Oh, yeah America Schmidt, please don't make me do this.
I have to vote for Hillary.
Get, get, get, get America, America.
- All right, but a bet is still a bet.
- Then I will hire, 'cause  You're fired.
You are fired.
You're a loser.
What can I say.
It's sad.
Your car is huge.
It's beautiful.
Opulent.
It's huge Someone just jump the curb and hit me now.
Please.
How much longer do I have to do this Schmidt?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 I am so excited about this glamping trip.
Sleeping bags are for hobos and children.
I am so pumped for this trip.
Aly and I figured out how many times we would have had sex since we've been apart, and it's a whole bunch.
And we're gonna play catch-up on all of it.
All 52 times.
I am about to take Aly to Mount Smushmore.
Know what I'm saying?
Aw.
That's lovely.
We need to invite other people.
- What about Nick?
- No, he can't.
He has some big writing weekend.
Wants me to give him notes on his novel.
He has all the pages in some large freezer bag.
It's a hard presentation to get excited about.
You know who would really want to come?
I am in!
Do you want me to bring my retractable s'mores pole?
Is that the car antenna that you've been putting in the dishwasher?
That is a low-level mystery that is driving me insane.
- Making him crazy.
- It's really handy.
All right, Jess.
So just a quick warning, okay?
This is a pretty couple-y's trip, and you know, we just don't want you to feel like a third wheel.
- Yeah.
- Oh.
I have people I can bring.
You I joined a singles group.
You're meeting new people.
- I think that's great.
- : Oh, my.
It's actually a group of all singles dedicated - to keeping each other single.
- Wow.
I think they could probably come on the trip.
Emotionally, they may not be available, but socially, they're available as hell.
: Just talk to her really quickly.
- You know what?
- Oh, you're already texting people.
They're probably not - They're in!
- Oh!
All of them!
Honestly, they would have gone to the DMV with you, if you had asked.
How long have you been standing there?
What happened to you?
The Pepperwood Chronicles, that's what happened to me.
- So it's really that bad.
- Nick.
This book is magnificent.
What?
Julius Pepperwood?
A hard-boiled Chicago cop turned New Orleans detective, racing around on fan-boats, drowning that two-faced DA in a bucket of jambalaya.
Yeah.
Right in the jambalaya.
Finding John F. Kennedy alive?
That wasn't too far?
It's a masterpiece, Nick.
Is that my whiteboard?
- You said I could have it.
- Well, we both know that's not true, but if it helps you get more of this story out, then, yes, you are welcome to it.
Well, all right, Schmidt, hit me; I want your notes.
No notes!
- No notes?
- No notes.
- No notes?
!
- No notes.
- No notes!
- No notes.
No notes!
No notes.
It's perfect, Nick.
I want another chapter by the time I get back on Sunday.
Then I guess it's time for me to get to work.
My little wobbly-nosed Michael Chabon.
- Hey, congratulations.
- Thank you, man.
I, uh Thank you.
I needed it.
I'm a writer.
'Sup?
I love you.
I miss you.
I love you.
I miss you.
You clearly didn't get my text, because your pants are still on.
So excited about this.
Hey, Aly!
Oh!
Your bra's already off.
Okay.
We're out the door.
None of this in my car, please.
I just had it shampooed.
Jess.
I called ahead and got us an early yurt check-in.
- Oh.
- Beep-beep.
People about to have sex coming through.
Look out.
Aren't you coming?
Actually, I'm gonna go with my group.
We rented a van.
It has a built-in microwave.
We're all really stoked about it.
You're not making me feel any better about this group of strangers.
Well, it's not all strangers.
Some of them are friends!
- Robby?
- My Robby?
Yeah.
I got here way too early, so I've just been standing outside, kind of waiting for my opportunity to enter.
How'd I do?
Robby, are you in this group?
-  - : Is he in the group?
Robby is the founder, president, and secretary of the group.
I formed the group after Nadia dumped me.
I always use two sugars.
My mom says 'cause I'm so sweet, you know.
Oh, whoa!
I didn't want to be alone, but I also didn't want to be in a relationship.
And that's when he got the idea to bring people together to help each other stay single.
Yeah, we meet weekly for non-romantic companionship.
- But most of all, we just have fun.
- Yeah.
Like last week, we shut down this Korean barbecue.
We paid with 13 different credit cards, and we were asked to never come back again.
It was epic!
- That sounds awesome.
- Oh, man.
It's a really cool group, and we have our own motto.
"I'm single and I'm sufficient".
- That's I-S-I-S.
That's ISIS.
- Th-that's ISIS.
- Oh, my God.
- You're asking people to join ISIS.
- No, n-n-n-n-n-n-no.
- As communication czar - I should have caught that.
- Yeah.
Isn't this group just a painfully transparent stall until you meet someone?
- Being single is a choice.
- Yeah.
- Don't single-shame.
- What is single-shame?
- No, honey.
He was not single-shaming you.
- I-I wasn't - That was not his intention at all.
- I don't even know what that is.
Couples always try to talk down to singles.
We can do everything that you guys can do.
I take myself out for a dessert date every Sunday.
Yeah, and yesterday, I had a backache, and I rubbed it myself, in a doorjamb.
This is bummin' me out.
Is this group gonna be a bummer?
Be honest.
Absolutely not.
There's Brenda.
She's a circuit court judge who also teaches taxidermy class for kids.
And Hugh.
He grows his own onions.
My former boss and current friend, Principal Foster.
His hip surgeon has okayed him for sex, but he hasn't okayed himself.
And of course, Robby, our leader.
Have you ever seen a group more ready to have fun with themselves?
Just look at this view; we needed this so badly.
It's-it's perfect.
Is it, though?
Can you stop hogging the vista?
There are other people who would like to take a photo.
I don't want to lose this light.
It's a traditional high-noon.
Don't couple-splain light to us.
It just seems like it would be easier - if you guys took a group photo.
- We actually need - a picture for our web site, - Oh, yeah.
So, all right, you can take a group photo.
All right, let's do this.
Now, I'm only taking one shot, so if the first one's a silly one, you're gonna have to live with a silly one.
Okay.
One, two, three.
There we go.
Great photo.
I'm gonna need one, too.
Actually, we're all gonna need one.
- What?
- Yeah, we don't share phones like you people.
Who shares phones?
- How would we call each other?
- I don't know.
I can't do this.
This is Take these back.
You guys are ruining a perfectly good vista moment.
Can't you go someplace else and "enjoy being single"?
Did you just quote-hands "enjoy being single" to us?
You guys are telling each other that you're happy being this, when we all know that you would rather be this.
No.
This is jazz hands, the end of an explosive musical number.
This is O.J. trying to put on the bloody glove.
This is freedom!
This is flying!
This is praying that you can go back to this!
This is high fives for everybody!
All around!
Yes!
Let's go to the lake, guys.
Bye.
I call dibs - on the slime-free part.
- Okay.
Just enjoy the view.
I mean This is O.J. putting back on the glove.
No notes.
Okay, just just start and see what Just start.
No notes.
All me.
No notes.
What does "no notes" even mean?
!
No notes.
No notes?
Come on.
Nick, I'm communing with nature, and I'm almost at peace.
What do you want?
No notes?
- Seriously?
- It is just so nice to get out of the city and watch TV.
What about this dumb thing?
When Pepperwood just watches - a block of local news.
- Oh, I found that part to be gutting, Nick.
I mean, the irony that Pepperwood's violent world is being translated into sound bites for mass consumption That's just me transcribing Channel 3 News!
I didn't even change the anchors' names!
- It's called realism, Nick.
- No.
- Good-bye, genius.
- No!
Ooh, that was Ooh.
Oh, my gosh.
13 times.
Yeah.
It's a lot of times.
- A lot of times.
-  I had a good time.
- I had a great time.
- I could've gone so many more times than that.
Yeah, that's actually nothing.
- I could go all night, girl.
- I could go - tens of so many more times.
- Tens of Ten Yeah.
- Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
-  Cool, cool, cool, cool.
- That's what's up.
That's what's up.
-  - That's what's up.
- Oh, it's the phone.
- : Hella?
- Winston, are you Hey, Winnie, are you okay?
You sound like you're being chased up a hill.
Oh, no.
Aly and I are just breaking each other off basically nonstop.
It's Nick.
I told him we were breaking each other off - basically nonstop.
- I know.
I can hear you, honey.
- Oh, you heard everything?
Okay.
- What does he want?
I'm in crisis right now.
Could you read my book and give me notes, please?
Oh, man.
I don't want to take a break.
Mmm.
Mm-mm.
I'm like a freight train right now.
I can't slow down.
Me either.
This is crisis!
- But - Guys, supporting our friend's artistic endeavors - is also insanely - Hey, guys.
Guys, pay attention.
- It's sexy.
- This is crisis.
- But I was thinking the same thing.
- Oh, thank God.
- Hello?
Winston!
Winston, - We could easily just both read the book - you're supposed to be my friend.
- At the same time, and then when we're done, just get right back at it.
- Right?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Great.
Now, do y do you guys want a PDF or do you want 100 individual JPEGs?
- JPEGs, JPEGs, J JPEGs.
- Uh, 100 individual JPEGs, please.
Yeah!
This is gonna take forever.
Five-three.
Hey.
Oh, I was just just playing a little single and sufficient badminton.
Well, I hope you worked up an appetite, because I'm gonna make my Singles Sliders.
- Oh, yeah?
- Okay, so what I do is I take the meat from three different sliders, and then I just sort of mash 'em into one big boy that stands on his own.
Oh.
So, like a burger.
Yeah, it's like a burger except it's bigger.
Oh.
Well, if it isn't Schmidt.
Or should I call you Schmidt-tata 'cause you have so much egg on your face?
- You little Italian egg omelet.
-  Nice.
Jess, what's happening in the lake over there?
- Wait, is that a jellyfish?
- Come over here.
Oh, please, that's so much less sexual than the stuff that you and Nick do on a regular basis.
Ow.
-  - It's happening.
Okay, Robby I'm on it.
Guys, guys.
No, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
You guys know that you can only be in this group if you're single, right?
It's tough.
I'm very horny.
I want you guys to be strong.
Let's do the motto.
- "I'm single - "I'm single - "and I'm sufficient".
- "and I'm sufficient".
Didn't sound like you meant it.
One more.
-  "I'm single and I'm sufficient".
- Yes.
- One last time.
- "I'm single and I'm sufficient"!
- Yes!
-  Well, I just hope we don't see a repeat of that kind of behavior with me later on.
You were amazing out there.
Your ability to dampen sexual chemistry is astounding.
Uh  Thanks.
Hey, guys!
I just caught a fish with my hand!
Wow.
Nick's book is astonishing.
I thought it was gonna take forever, but it was perfect.
He really brings you into the world.
Every minor character is so well thought out.
The newsboy?
You could see his whole life.
And am I the only one who thought that the murderer's name - was in the song?

Ah.
So good.
No notes.

Just a short walk to our yurt.
Unless we take the scenic route.
Oh.
Nothing gets me in the mood like scenery.
- Mmm?
- Let's do that.
Yeah, let's go that way.
Yeah, let's do that.
The scenic way.
Perhaps you could find the perfect bun if I don't know You had your glasses.
Oh.
Oh, you know you know who else has glasses?
Six out of ten people in the developed world, including Robby and I?
Jess, just give over to it.
We're happy for you.
Use your yurt.
You have a world-class yurt.
Yeah, and if this is about me and Robby dating years ago, trust me, - it doesn't matter.
- Mm-mm.
We only did hand stuff, per his neurosis, -  - so you totally have my blessing.
Blessing for what?
- This.
- That.
Guys, I am not into Robby.
And I could never date a guy who wears glasses because of the clown from my dreams.
The clown who wears glasses.
Oh, my God, that clown is me.
I'm not dating Robby, okay?
Hey.
- Oh, Robby.
- Oh, hey, Robby.
I heard my name a bunch of times.
I mean, I could tell that you weren't trying to call me in here, but, uh, my curiosity kicked in, so A couple of us are gonna wander down and, uh, you know, tell some stories and, uh  sing a few songs.
That sounds great.
Actually, you know who loves to sing?
Actually, I've really been hating music lately.
Come on, Jess, you're a whore for singin'.
Please.
I hear the drums echoing tonight but she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation She's coming in, 12:30 flight The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation -  - Damn it!
Nick, if this is about notes, so help me God.
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna stop bugging you until you note me, Schmidt.
All right, Nick.
Here's a note.
Stop cutting yourself off at the knees like a selfish coward.
Okay, great, great.
I love the direction we're going.
We're getting more critical, but can you refocus to the writing?
No, Nick, I cannot, and you want to know why?
Because you are a writer.
And a damn good one at that.
But you're just too scared to admit it to yourself.
Goodbye, sir.
No!
Damn, you raven-haired dandy boy.
Yeah, thought carving our names - in the trees would have taken longer.
- Yeah.
So do you want want to have sex?
Yeah.
I think that's Yeah, let's Listen, Aly, I got to admit, I'm pretty tapped out.
I-I'm sorry to say it like that, but, you know, I'm - No.
Me, too!
I know!
- We've had too much sex too fast!
- Why didn't we pace ourselves?
-  I'm so exhausted.
Oh, my gosh, I think this whole ordeal just illustrates why three months isn't three days.
- So happy you said that.
-  I'm just happy to be in the same place as you.
Me, too.
And, you know, we did do it 13 times.
- That's a lot.
- That's a lot of times.
But you know what my favorite time was?
- 11?
- 11.
You knew.
Oh, I knew.
11 was great.
Mm.
Maybe we should do 11 again.
But this time I'm the mermaid.
Okay.
I'm the mermaid.
: No, I'm the mermaid.
- Kind of, uh Yeah, right there.
- Perfect.
- Get your butt down there.
-  Come here!
- Ooh!
-   It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do I bless the rains down in Africa This is electric.
I bless the rains down in Africa I bless the rain  I bless the rains down in Africa Gonna take some time to do the things we never had - Had.
- Wait!
Stop!
I can't!
You can't what?
I can't ignore what's going on with Brenda and Hugh!
We weren't doing anything!
I hope you guys were behaving, all right?
Because you know what happens on strike two.
Strike two and Strike You're not out on strike two, but, you know, strike two, you're on thin ice.
- Jess should be on thin ice.
- Ugh!
She took us on a couples trip!
Yeah, that's like taking alcoholics to a brewery!
Nobody here wants to hear from you, Hugh.
You Hugh.
You Hugh.
You made us hang out with your lame couples friends!
- How are we lame?
- There is no reason to attack us.
And when singing Toto, why is it always "Africa"?
- They've got a deep catalog!
-  Okay.
Look, I think we can all agree that Jess is a very important member of this group.
You hypocrite.
Before you cast aspersions on anyone else, you need to take a good long look at yourself, Robby!
- The emperor - I don't even know - has no clothes!
- why we bothered coming here!
And you sexualized Toto.
No, you make a good I know those guys.
They're good guys!
Know what?
Enough!
Okay, I'm not, uh Guys, I'm not actually gonna smash my guitar to get your attention.
But listen, I don't want you to lose faith in this group.
Okay?
Just lose faith in me.
Because you're right.
I have been a hypocrite.
Uh I do have feelings for Jess.
Ooh.
Just he didn't say what kind of feelings.
They're sexual and romantic feelings.
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, boy.
Well, what do you know?
I'm really sorry about last night.
Where's the group?
The group is kind of permanently done.
Robby sent out a final e-mail.
It was in Latin, uh, and it was in this gothic font.
I'm kind of worried about him.
Why don't you give the guy a chance, Jess?
I'm not interested right now.
So, what, are you just gonna give up on love, - be alone forever?
Like - No, you know me.
I love love!
Anything in pairs makes me choked up.
Shoes, socks, chopsticks.
I'm just in kind of a confusing place right now, and I think you guys know why.
It's about Nick, right?
Yes, of course we are talking about Nick.
- I knew it.
- Yes, I'm talking about Nick.
- I knew it.
- I knew it.
But, look, I want you to know something.
I'm really, really happy being single right now.
I'm sorry if my group ruined your weekend.
They're really cool people if you get to know them.
- I'm sure.
-  Yeah.
Oh, my God, I have to go.
Foster got a corn chip in his eye.
Okay, you know what?
We need to make a pact to befriend at least one other married couple.
Yeah, but how are we gonna do that?
We don't have a kid, and I refuse to take cooking classes.
I don't know.
Maybe we just go to a Norah Jones concert, stand outside and look lost.
Well, Schmidty, you pulled a real Mr. Miyagi on the whole "no notes, tough love" routine.
Let me see it.
Ooh!
Nick, there's a whole nother chapter here!
How did you make this happen?
I worked because of you.
And who is this wise, denim-clad Jewish chaplain?
Sch-Schmith?
That was the big thing.
You helped me realize that Pepperwood needed a Schmith.
Okay.
While it's an honor to be included in the world that you've created here, um  the Schmith character seems, uh, grotesque.
- Yeah, he's unlikeable.
- I don't understand why, when we meet this character, he-he's kicking a puppy.
He's the bad guy in Pepperwood's life.
He's mean, he's He's not somebody you want to introduce to Mom and Dad.
- The cha the character.
- Schmith is a dirt bag.
I have no respect for Schmith, - and neither should anybody else.
- I think that's a mistake to say those things about the character.
I appreciate what you're saying, but I'm happy with what I have.
- I don't need any notes.
- Oh, now it's no notes?
!
Nick?
Nick?
!
Sit anywhere?
What's up, Robby?
Hey, sorry.
I'll leave.
I was almost done..
No!
You'll ruin your food!
Yeah, just like I ruined the group.
You didn't ruin anything.
We're - We're still hanging out.
- Really?
Okay, so could you guys vote me back in maybe?
We voted to get rid of voting.
It's the same, just, uh, without the rules.
Jess, I don't really know what to say.
Don't say anything.
It's fine.
I'm just gonna read.
Um, Winston gave me a copy of Nick's book.
It's actually pretty good.
- Um -  Except the foreword says, "Best enjoyed with shrimp cocktail".
You can go back to your crossword puzzle.
- It's a word search.
- Oh.
Hey, Robby?
Hmm?
Should should we just share a table?
Is that crazy?
I don't think it's crazy at all.
Do you?
- No.
I mean, I suggested it, so, no.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Oh, thanks.
Ooh, ooh, ooh  Ooh, ooh, ooh Hey, Jess?
Um I just found the word "locomotive," backwards and diagonal.

Get back from the curb!
- There's maniacs out here!
- Well, I'm being careful, Mom.

I could not get through a weekend with Schmidt's mom without you.
Do you know that she carried him for 11 months?
- PADFUNT.
- PAD PADFUNT?
Positivity Always, Decency Forever, Understanding No Trouble.
That's my strategy for surviving New York.
And that's how you survive Louise.
Look at my boy!
- Are you wearing suntan lotion?
- Yes.
- Say hello to your brother.
- Oh, hello, Reggie.
Kiss your brother.
- What?
- Kiss your brother.
He loves it!

Kiss him on the lips.
- He loves it.
Come on.
- I don't want to, Mama!
Come on, Schmidt.
It's okay.
I'll kiss him.
Why would you do that?
He's your husband's brother.
That's gross.
- Hey, Louise.
- Ah, there she is.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, Nick and I are gonna grab a cab into the city.
Get one of our famous extravagant lunches.
- Your what?
- You know our thing.
We're men of means.
We like nice lunches.
Men of means?
This is New York City.
A city only one Baldwin can afford.
I would love to offer up a retort, but true men of means - are rich in dignity.
- Yes, they're also rich in money.
Just remember to be back by 7:00.
And it's Fitzgerald High School in Great Neck.
- If you can't remember Great Neck, - Sure.
that's what they used to call me in high school, 'cause Well, 'cause I was dangerously fat, specifically in the neck area.
- We won't forget.
Let's get a cab.
-  - Men of means!
- Men of means!
Welcome to Long Island, the real New York.
- This is such a lovely home, Louise.
- Yes, it is.
- Who wants Crystal Light?
- Oh, me.
Thank you.
That is good.
I'd kiss you, but that would mean I made out with both of Schmidt's parents.
-  -  Yeah.
- Good vibes.
Great trip so far.
- Well I'm gonna go wardrobe prep for tonight and press my suit.
- I'll press it.
- Or I I can press it.
Can you, though?
: PADFUNT.
Whew!
I am stuffed.
What a lunch.
Expensive but worth it.
I'm still feeling a bit peckish.
Please, a third lobster at once.
And a telephone on a tray.
Rotary.
-  -  Men of means!
It was lavish, but we deserved it.
80% tip, zero percent regret.
Ooh, that sounds good.
Hey keep it up.
Little five spot.
Little crispy Abe!
Hey, today, we are going for it.
Yeah, man.
- You got it?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's, that's all you right there.
- You got it?
Man, I don't have any money.
I need to borrow a little bit.
I spent everything.
- I was gonna ask you.
- I spent all my cash on lunch.
Well, I only take prepaid debit cards with me on trips so I can stick to a budget.
I'm tapped out, man.
Use your credit card.
- I don't have a credit card!
- You don't have a credit card?
Once you get one, you're in their system.
I have zero dollars.
Okay, well, how are we supposed to get to Long Island?
- So, we don't have any money?
-   Excuse me?
I put five dollars in there earlier.
I need to take $4.50 out.
I guess you could say my ears are bigger than my pockets.
Oh!
Very close to hitting my finger!
Brother, brother, brother.
How you doing, black man?
Black man, how you?
Aah!
Oh!
- I got this.
Let me tap in.
-  Black man, black man, my brother, my brother.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Is that the homecoming welcome package?
I want to see what picture of me they used.
- I sent in, like, 20.
-  I hope they used the one of me shaking hands with Pierce Brosnan.
We really ruined his dinner, but it was worth it.
What the hell?
There's, like, 100 honorees.
"An opportunity for various alumni "to support our dream of purchasing a new gymnasium scoreboard"?
They're not honoring me.
They're shaking me down!
Of course.
The alumni association is run by the same jerks who used to pull this crap on me back in high school.
Every student council meeting needs some pizza.
Here you go, Marissa.
My treat.
Cool.
Thanks.
You can take off now.
But it's my house.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna go for a lap around the block, then.
The only thing she devoured more than my pizza was my self-esteem, and now she's back for seconds.
- Ugh!
That's gut-wrenching!
- Sorry, sweetheart.
I'm sorry in a way only a mother could be.
It sucks that it was so cool to be a bully when we were young.
This is a disaster.
If you need me, I'll be in my room blasting Dookie on cassette.
Wait!
Schmidt.
: Oh.
- Freakin' New York.
-  Ma, you turned my room into Reggie's room?
I hate my brother!
- You all right in there, baby?
- I got this.
A mother knows how.
You all right in there, baby?
Let me try.
- Schmidt?
Schmidt?
Schmidt?
- I am one of those - Melodramatic fools - Schmidt?
Schmidt?
- Neurotic to the bone - Schmidt?
- No doubt about it - Schmidt?
- Schmidt?
- Okay, okay.
: Just one more.
- Schmidt?
-  Shut up!
- : Yes, I did it.
- Leave me alone, ass hat!
I know you didn't mean that.
Is there anything that we can do to make you feel better right now?
- Schmaegalman's.
- Schmaegalman's?
Schmaegalman's is his favorite deli.
He loves their soup.
He's telling us he's hungry!
Do you not know when he's hungry?
- I know when he's hungry, Louise.
- I'll stay here in case he needs me.
- Cece, you go get the soup.
- Maybe I should stay here, - considering I'm his wife?
- Fine.
We'll order in Ling's Palace.
It's fine.
It's just fine.
: We're getting Ling's Palace because your wife won't get Schmaegalman's.
- Aah!
- Hey, guys.
I want everyone to have a really great trip.
You both stay here.
I'm gonna go to Schmergerman - I'm gonna go to Schmaegel -  Schmaegalman's.
- Bagelman's?
- No.
Schmaegalman.
- Maegalman's?
- Maegal.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go to to the deli.
- You?
- Can I borrow your car, please?
If you get so much as a scratch on it, you'll never leave New York.
- Because you'll be dead.
- Because I'll be dead.
- You can't handle that deli.
- I think I can handle going to a deli.
PADFUNT.
I got this.
We got this, man.
Don't worry about it.
We're industrious, you know?
We're resourceful.
Just got to  Hey.
Follow my lead.
Gather round, everybody Gather round, everybody  - They're gathering.
Gather round.

That's what we're gonna do.
What time is it?
It's showtime.
What time is it?
It's showtime.
Who wants to see what he's gonna do?
- I do!
- 'Cause I'm gonna do it.
- He's gonna do it!
- I'll do it!
-  Got to do it!
- Let's do it!
- It's honestly time to do it!
- Yeah, we're about to!
Y'all don't want to miss this!

- We gonna do something with this!
- Oh, yeah.

The next L train - is now arriving - What is this?

On the Manhattan track.
Did it just work?
Yes, sir, my man, I think it did!
Let's count up all this loot.
That's several see what we find right here.
That's seventy We got 72 cents.
So if we just stall until the train arrives, we never have to do anything.
- What time is it?
- It's showtime!
- What time is it?
- It's showtime!
Excuse me, sir.
Is this the line?
What a New York character.
You're a New York character.
Oh, sorry.
Um, I was just getting in line behind you.
Don't want to get in a pickle.
That's just deli fun.
Oh.
There you go, sweetheart.
Okay, there we go!
- Hi, do you have special soup - This is the cream cheese line.
Next.
- You're still here?
- I'm sorry.
I'll just - Next!
- Yes, um - Too slow!
Next!
- Two pounds of whitefish.
- Beautiful baby.
Okay.
- Don't talk to me.
-  43, 44, 45, 46 - Oh, yes, um - 46.
Two black-and-whites.
- May I please have the Oh, uh, - Excuse me, I'm 45.
- Yeah, he already called it, slowpoke.
- Here you go.
- Welcome to New York.
No!
I'm 45!
45 is before 46!
You'll get your damn cookies when you give me your ass!
One large special soup now!
Schmidt, it's Jess.
I got your soup but not until I punched this city in the damn throat.
I thought you were all about keeping it positive.
That is for sucker MCs and West Coast punks.
This city's a jungle, so you better be a freaking lion.
That goes for you, too, Schmidt.
I had an epiphany getting your soup.
That's what you got to do tonight.
- What are you talking about?
- You're a really special guy, and you got to let everyone in high school know that.
So you got to go to that homecoming, you got to grab that mic, and you got to roast that Marissa and the rest of those junkyard fat cats.
I'm gonna tell them all what I really think of them.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Somebody bring me an ironing board!
- Oh, I got it, babe.
- Coming, darling!
What else you got, New York?
- You want to step into me?
- Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop!
NYPD!
Ma'am, I need to commandeer this vehicle.
If you want to commandeer this vehicle, then you're gonna have to commandeer this ass.
- Thanks a lot New York.
- Aah!
Watch my soup.
What are you doin'?
Where'd you learn to drive?
Damn it.
You commandeered my friend's mom's car and then you crashed it?
That's like me asking to borrow your dumb cop jacket and then just crashing it.
Man, I thought I had this city licked.
But in the end, it was me who got licked.
Wait, did that actually happen?
'Cause there have been some reported lickings recently, and if you got a good look at the guy I was obviously speaking metaphorically.
Right.
Me, too.
Our city is wonderful.
It's a great place to walk around.
So what about my friend's mom's car?
Let me guess, there's nothing you can do.
No, ma'am, listen, everything's gonna be fine.
Just go to the 99th Precinct, and I promise you You will be treated in the most efficient and pleasant way imaginable.
Proof of ownership.
Liability release.
Waiver of responsibility.
Smog check.
Non-operation of a boat.
Waiver of somethin'.
Liability release.
Ya-dee-da.
Da-dee-da.
And da.
This is an application to join the NYPD softball team.
You think I like sitting here, handing you form after form?
- Kind of.
- You're right.
I do.
God, it's like you're in here.
Aw, the train!
What terrible timing.
You're gonna miss the show.
What a drag!
- It's crazy, man.
-  This is amazing.
Do you guys need volunteers?
Because I'll do it.
I was just telling my son how I've always dreamed of being a busker.
Well, guess what.
You have just introduced yourself to the best buskers in the business.
Ladies and gentlemen, due to a signal problem at 51st Street all trains are currently delayed.
Thank you for your patience.
What do we do now, Winston?
We are about to busk, baby.
Okay, you're busking with the best!
In the most unbelievable, I said inconceivable, unthinkable, unbelievable, - also unthinkable - Are you stalling?
In what world?
In-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in  What-what-what-what-what-what- what-what-what-what - Jess?
- Hey, Cece, I-I know I'm late.
- It's this freakin' city.
- Huh?
- A cop wrecked Louise's car.
- What?
- I'm waiting to talk to his captain.
- What are you talking about right now?
Just tell her it's fine.
Did you tell Schmidt to do a roast tonight?
Funk yeah, I did.
That's how you deal with this town.
- Well, I think that's a huge mistake.
- What, to defend your husband?
- I didn't say that, Louise.
- Mom, how's this?
"In conclusion, you're ugly.
I make money.
"You just got roasted by the California Kid".
- I think it's sensational.
-  Can you please just get back here?
- We're not ready yet!
- We're not ready yet, 'cause I got to do something that you didn't know I was about to do.
- Do it!
- Blow your mind.
Oh.
- Another piece of the puzzle!
- Whoa!
- We're taking it to the top!
- Do it, do it,  - Thank you for starting that chant.
- Do You got it.
Okay, it's, uh it's looking like we have to do it.
- Okay, I don't know what "it" is.
- "It" is looking like a jump.
Okay, that is bone-chilling news.
It's too long.
Look, we have no choice, okay?
We got to get to Long Island.
-  - We can do it.
We can do it.
- All right!
Here we go!
- Okay!
Here we go!
Here we go!
On the count of three.
One, two, three.
Let this be a moment  A moment you shine : You can do it!
'Cause you can do anything.
-  -    That was great.
That was great!
I broke my back.
Winston.
We-Well, your car should be fixed by morning.
- How do I know you're not lying?
- I never lie.
Although I told my mother her hair looked good once and it didn't.
Just looked okay.
Okay, I believe you, even though you're from the city of garbage water and pizza trash.
What is your problem with this city?
I've just never had a good experience here.
I came here once before and it was a complete disaster.
Did you go to the opera and were disappointed?
- It's this new director.
- No, I actually I had this great week planned, and then thing after thing went wrong, and then I cut my trip off early.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- That's when that was?
- Obviously, I don't know because I have no idea what you're talking about.
I left early and I went home and surprised my boyfriend.
Who's that girl It's Jess.
Spencer was the actual worst.
He called sex "making tacos".
Well, you know what I always say?
- Things happen for a reason - Yes, and the reason that New York sucked was because - I was supposed to catch Spencer, - No, you didn't let me finish.
'cause I wasn't supposed to end up with him.
I always say things happen for a reason, and that reason is random chance.
No, you were right the first time.
New York wasn't kicking my ass, it was nudging it, gently, in the right direction.
Just like you are right now.
Yes.
Yes, that's what's happening.
You can't be mad at your past it makes you who you are.
And Oh, my God.
I told my friend to do something really stupid, and I have to go stop him.
Hey, do you want to do something very, super considerate?
We can't provide you with a police escort.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.
- Yeah, you were.
- Yeah, I was.
- But here: my lunch.
It's not Schmaegalman's, but take it.
It's Ling's Palace.
It's fine.
It's just fine.
Oh, Dragon!
Did I miss it?
Uh-uh.
It's cool.
That's a really realistic-looking costume, with the smoke and everything.
Oh, you're just hotboxing.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm a vice principal.
- Hey - Oh!
- You're a mess, dude.
-  And with Fitzgerald High's new scoreboard, we can make Great Neck great again.
Wait, wait, Schmidt.
What?
What, is my makeup too thick?
What?
No, no, you look great.
Uh, look, you can't do this.
I was wrong.
Wh What are you talking about?
This was your idea.
I know.
But I was wrong.
- You can't be mad at these people.
- But they were all horrible to me Jess.
And that's why you left.
You created your own path.
You changed cities.
You made friends.
You found your purpose.
You met the love of your life.
- I sure did.
- Just enjoy your evening.
You know, you have nothing to say to these people.
If anything Thank you.
I can't wait to see the look on Schmidt's face when he realizes we made it.
Well, he wanted us to make it.
As I was saying, though, I can't wait to see the look on his face when he realizes that we made it, though, right?
- That's just gonna be like, "Oh".
- I know, but just be exc Yeah, I can't wait, though, right?
Okay?
We can't score without you.
Whoa.
Hello.
Is this Schmidt?
What what are you doing?
Um  Excuse me, Marissa, I'm very sorry.
I I would just be remiss if I let this moment pass me by.
You know, I'm a lucky man.
Because I wouldn't be the man that I am today if it weren't for the experiences that I've had right here.
So, thank you for being the worst that humankind has to offer.
That includes Harvey Levin and every cast member that's ever been on The Real World/Road Rules Challenge.
Thank you for showing me that athletic apparel is something that should never be worn outside the house, you chubby-thumbed pickle hoarders.
And in conclusion, you're all ugly.
I make money.
You just got roasted by the California Kid.
I did it!
Oh, you sure do talk a lot when your mouth isn't full - Great Neck.
-  Thank you, Schmidt.
Boy, that was real embarrassing for you, huh?
They're taunting my baby.
- This is not good.
-  Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Cece Schmidt.
So if any of you have anything else you'd like to say to my husband, I will drag you outside and we will handle this L.A. style.
I will take you to the corner of Fairfax and La Brea.
Those are parallel streets.
I'm not telling her that.
- That's my daughter!
-  We have to leave.
Where's my car?
Even though your car is definitely here, it's a beautiful night let's walk.
Okay, look, she clearly did something weird with your car, - but I got something.
- Trust us.
Sepulveda!
La Cienega, bitches.
El Matador beach.
You're just naming places in Southern California.
Nickel Canyon!
What the - Told you we were men of means.
- Men of means!
-  - Yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- All right!
Scoot over, scoot over, I can't fit.
- Later, bro - Tell 'em this story, Denny.
Tell 'em all!
You guys have a good time.
All right.
Uh  Oh, man, I'm a mess.
God, it's a perfect fall New York day.
I'm almost sorry we're leaving.
What the hell is going on?
Were you not gonna call me?
How long you been here?
- We literally just got here.
- Well, we were gonna go - I had a, uh - If I wasn't If I didn't just run into you, you guys would have just been The only reason I'm not pissed it's because I've been in L.A. like five times.
- So we're good.
-  I've got other friends
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Who is ready to strip?
You see you mean strip wallpaper at your new house, but me, myself, I always err on the side of sexy.
-  - Okay.
You were up there a long time, man.
Yeah, I was running out of imaginary dollar bills.
Right, so we are off to buy drinking water.
Yes, the water at Jaipur Aviv tastes like it's been fracked.
- See you guys there.
- Jaipur Aviv?
Yeah, Schmidt named their house Jaipur Aviv to celebrate the union of India and Israel that their marriage represents.
So this is the future, the three of us.
- Do we need a name?
- The winners.
- Winston and the Cuties.
- Eh, I don't think we need a name.
But we do need a fourth roommate, because I think Oh, my God!
This loft is enormous.
Thank you, Winston.
I was going there, but it was gonna be a long walk.
This place is way too big for three people.
What about your dream of having an in-loft multipurpose room?
Multipurpose rooms can't pay rent.
- That's the only purpose they don't serve.
- So let's get a roommate.
Well, Cece and Schmidt'll be here another six months, so we have time to find someone we like.
Someone who's a girl.
- A girl, hmm.
- Winston, thoughts?
Hmm?
I'm in.
I'm sorry.
I was just distracted by how big this loft is.
- First time you ever thought about it?
- I'm gonna go look for echoes.
Hello.
- Hello.
-  Oh, my God!
- You guys hearing this?
- You guys hearing this?
- Ha!
Oh, my God!
- Stop.
He'll go all day.
Hello, wall.
Prepare to be naked.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
What do you think about Reagan?
Well, she's great.
A-plus posture.
I mean she's moving to L.A. next month.
What do you think about Reagan as our roommate?
'Cause she would live in my room, but she'd still pay rent.
And then you could have that multipurpose room where you could shower and cook.
Well, I'd still use the bathroom and the kitchen for showering and cooking, but I would use the multipurpose room for everything else, -  - and I'd be living across the hall from my ex and his new girlfriend.
Not sure why I said those two in the same tone.
You know what, forget it actually.
- I-I That's on me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I didn't think of the ex-girlfriend thing.
- Forget it.
- She's a girl who we like, - and she's lived there before.
- I know.
And then that gets us out of the whole "Here's what you need to know about Winston" conversation.
- That's always a long weekend.
- I know.
She would overlap with Schmidt and Cece.
And six people is a violation of the loft agreement.
But loft agreements are reached to be amended.
- So you're really okay with this?
- Yes.
I mean, that's how a normal person would say yes.
I need the trademark Jessica Day yes.
- Yes!
- Okay, that's a little bit too much.
I think it's got to be somewhere in the middle.
Ye-yes.
Great.
Yeah.
You know, there is something so familiar about this room.
I don't know.
It's like I've been here before.
: Wow  Babe, I know you were planning on doing all of the heavy lifting - when it comes to decorating - Interior design.
Cece, this is a home.
It's not a Christmas cookie.
So you've said.
But this is our first joint venture, and I really want to help.
The only thing better than realizing my interior design vision will be realizing our interior design vision.
Great.
Okay, so this is what I'm seeing A boar's head over the fireplace with a decorative pedestal backing.
Or - How did I know that?
- this color for our bathroom.
- What do you think?
- I love it.
You do?
Because I know that our tastes haven't always jived.
You think that we're greeting people in our home to "La Cucaracha"!
This is the paint swatch choice of a serious interior designer.
You should save that for when we renew our vows.
I love you.
Bathroom's going to look great.
- Huh, that's a pretty color.
- Ooh-ee, yes, it is.
For a third world doctor's office.
I love this.
What is this, yellow?
Six words you never get to hear: Nick is calling a loft meeting.
I call to order this off-site loft meeting.
Nick, you have the floor.
I propose Reagan move into the loft.
She is a likable girl who is not Coach.
Thank you very much for your time.
As cosponsor of this bill, it has my full and unconditional support.
Full and unconditional support.
Today, we will vote to amend the No More Than Five Damn People May Live in This Loft at Any One Time Act.
Formerly the No More Than Four Damn People May Live in This Loft at Any One Time Act.
We will be voting as is our custom by secret ballot.
The vote must be unanimous.
- What'd you write?
- Shh.
Okay.
- Three yays, two nays?
- What?
What the hell?
!
Even after my speech?
I really thought this was gonna cheer me up.
Nick.
- I swear I voted yay.
-  I know.
And it means a lot to me, because I really want her to move in.
But I don't have the votes.
What can you do?
You're only short two votes.
- I can get you two votes.
- You can do that?
- Can a shark ruin a family vacation?
- No.
I mean if it bites someone.
- Maybe, then yeah.
- Maybe?
It depends on the vacation, but yeah.
Can a puppy make a baby smile?
I mean, there's a lot of factors.
- Just - Depends on Thanks for helping is what I meant to say.
So the two votes against Reagan moving in must be Schmidt and Winston.
Thank God you had these magnets.
Yeah, well they're a backup housewarming gift for Schmidt and Cece in case my quilt guy screws me again.
Thank God you found this mysteriously sticky wall.
Let's go get Schmidt and Winston and change their votes.
- I can't believe those two.
- You stay here and wait.
I can't.
I'm going too crazy.
I'm coming with you.
Nick, you're way too invested.
Plus, it's tacky to whip your own votes.
We both know that never works with these guys.
Schmidt, Winston prepare to be buttonholed.
Did you just say "buttonholed"?
I mean whatever you got to do, Jess, but gross.
It's only one room, one flaw.
Every beautiful thing has one flaw.
Marilyn Monroe has her beauty mark.
- "Thriller" has its Vincent Price poem.
-  Babe.
Do you like this ceiling fan?
Wicker wicker blades!
They are made from reclaimed hampers.
It's like a dirty laundry propeller above our bed.
- : Yes.
- Okay!
I love that we're on the same page.
That's right.
Two flaws.
Okay.
Two flaws.
No beautiful thing has two flaws, only ugly things.
It's spreading.
Thank you, Winston.
Now I feel validated.
No, no, no, no.
I just figured out why I know this house.
You see, it's in my favorite school district.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
Hey, Nick.
- Sorry about the vote.
- I don't want to talk about it.
Cool.
I need your help with a situation.
There is no situation you could possibly describe compelling enough - to get me to want to help you.
- Schmidt and Cece's house was the location for the 1971 pornographic film, Daddy's Longleg.
Okay, maybe there's one situation.
I'm 100% in.
- That piece is exquisite.
-  Oh!
- May I see it from another angle?
-   He was my best friend - until he became my enemy.
-  The boar goes up, and the robe comes down.
That's porn.
- You got this on a heavy rotation.
- Super heavy rotation.
Please don't dance while we're watching porn videos together.
Oh, sorry about that.
But I mean this is Schmidt and Cece's fireplace, right?
It looks like it, doesn't it?
But if it is - he can never know.
- : Oh, come on Nick.
You know that.
He can never know.
Yes, but we're already keeping five secrets from him.
- The secret vault is full.
- That's not true.
We only have four.
- We have a slot open.
- You always forget.
- Lost umbrella.
- I forgot about lost umbrella.
- Mm.
- I always forget about lost umbrella.
: That's why it was lost.
So we're at maximum capacity.
So what do we do?
Okay, so pornographic house has to go into the vault.
- Agreed.
- So what do we declassify?
- JalapeÃ±o 19?
- JalapeÃ±o 19?
No way.
Uh Duck, Duck, Gavin?
Oh, Duck, Duck, Gavin has to stay a secret.
I would love to keep Upper Deck Timeshare between us and the guy we paid off.
There are no good options.
Are you sure this is the house?
I think so, but maybe not.
Okay, so here's what we're gonna do.
I'm going to watch with fresh eyes and I'm gonna see what my gut tells me, - okay?
- Yeah.
You go around the house, you take photos - for comparison.
- Mm-hmm.
Yes.
We'll look at all the pics, we'll come back here later, - Mm-hmm.
- We'll make a, you know, a final call.
- Boom.
-  - I need the phone for pictures.
- I need it to watch the porn.
- Use your phone.
- It already started buffering.
- It's two minutes in.
- : It's buffering.
Take mine and take pictures with that.
Makes sense.
It's very smart, and that is why we are The Keepers of the Five Secrets.
Keepers of the Five Secrets.
- Shh.
- : Don't say a word.
Gah!
Secret ballots are never really secret.
You know that, right?
Okay fine.
You got me.
I voted nay.
It would just be six people for too long.
We would continue to be a married couple living with three roommates.
You want to make it four, increasing our humiliation by 33%.
Mr. Miller has no interest in seeing you humiliated.
And as such, I've been empowered to offer you the following.
I'm listening.
As a symbolic gesture, Reagan cannot list the loft as her official residence.
- Where will her mail go?
- A P.O. Box.
Oh, yeah.
All right, keep going.
When asked where you live, you and Reagan will say the following.
"Geez, beats us.
We're just dumb kids living paycheck to paycheck.
"Thank gosh for our upwardly mobile friends Schmidt and Cece, "and the three guest rooms in their loft.
"We're crashing with them until we get our lives together "and we remain there at their pleasure".
Do I have to memorize all that?
No, you can just read it from the toilet paper.
-  - And finally you will allow Schmidt to buy you one pair of jeans.
Oh, he's serious.
Hey, Jess.
Did Schmidt tell you I was gonna be in here?
- No.
- Then how come you didn't get scared?
Before I enter any bathroom, I take a moment to myself and say, "No matter what happens in there, "don't get scared".
And it works, you know, except for that one time when I was at the Cubs Okay Jess, don't move.
- What's happening?
- Don't worry about it.
Hey, do me a favor.
Put an arch in your back, just -  - Got it.
Okay.
Let's take one together.
- Oh, like a prom picture.
- Yeah, kind of.
: Here we -  - Got it.
I actually might need to retake that.
I think my eyes were closed.
But first, let me see if any of this pork makes your tummy rumble.
Winston would like you and Reagan to spend a mutually agreed upon amount of time as a couple with Ferguson.
We're talking about the cat?
The only couples that Ferguson knows are interracial.
And while Winston views this as progress, he knows that it's not an accurate portrayal of the world.
You even think that cat knows Winston exists?
Definitely not.
Next, Winston would like to be the first person to see you in your new jeans.
And he will see you under these circumstances, and these circumstances only: descending a grand spiral staircase, as Winston waits at the bottom, weeping with pride, holding your new belt.
He wants me to go upstairs without a belt.
Some We rent a really nice mansion.
Hey, you could do it, like, a museum I'm not going to a public place and doing this with him.
Do you want the yays or not?
I need the yays.
The motion on the floor is the same, with some riders, most notably the Furguson Bishop, White Immersion Program.
Um, four yays, one nay?
- Who's this nay?
- I asked you what you wanted.
And I voted yay.
That was about the vote?
I thought y'all just wanted to get to know me better.
I was already a yay.
Well, that's everybody.
Who's left?
Parikh, prepare to be buttonholed.
I'm sorry I took your yay for granted.
Let me wet your beak a little bit you want sink time, you want fridge space, you want Schmidt and Winston to let you in on this whole jeans thing?
No, I don't want anything, okay.
I voted nay because I'm trying to protect you.
- From who?
- From you, you lunatic.
You were being a good friend to Nick by letting Reagan move in, but I wouldn't be a good friend to you if I just let that happen.
If Nick wants Reagan to move in, then I want Reagan to move in.
I mean, I don't want her to move in, but I I support it.
You can support something without being the poster child for it, okay, so just maybe take a step back.
I can't do that because my love for Nick exists, so it has to come out somewhere.
If you put water in Bugs Bunny's hole, it's gonna shoot out some other hole where Elmer Fudd least expects it.
Is this other hole friendship?
Exactly.
So I can't express my feelings for Nick through my romance hole, so I need to express them through my friendship hole.
And I really regret hitching my wagon to "hole".
But you you get it, okay?
I want you to know I'm gonna be fine, okay?
- You promise?
- I promise.
Okay, all right, I'll vote yay.
If Nick and Reagan aren't physical outside of their room.
I'm sorry, but I have to protect you a little, okay, so just deal with it.
That's a really great rider, Cece.
You see, I think this is the tub where Daddy bathes the Soviet dissident.
And this has to be the window seat where he spanks the Aztec twins.
Hey, side note, thank you for voting yay on the Reagan vote.
I really want her to move in.
I think I'm ready for this.
She will, and you are very much so ready.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So many close-ups.
It's so frustrating.
I mean, for our purposes of today.
You know, mostly when they cut to wide I'm thinking why the hell are you showing me the room?
But now I want to see the room.
I don't want to see the close-ups.
Well, there's only one thing left.
Search the locations manager for the 1971 adult film Daddy's Longleg.
Very smart.
SEARCH  Searching now.
- Secrets.
- Secrets.
Cece, this is the hardest thing that I've ever had to say to you.
I had always assumed that when you got serious about interior design, I was going to love your ideas.
Because I love you.
I hate your ideas.
I hate them almost as much as I love you, which is so much.
I have to stop you right there.
I appreciate the fact that you are a very dramatic man, but the next time you start a conversation with, "This is the hardest thing that I have ever had to say to you," it better end with, "I'm gay now," "I found a lump in my nut," or, "He came out of nowhere, help me get the blood off of my car".
I can't live in a house that you don't love.
And I also can't live in a house of horrors!
Thank you for taking my note about being dramatic.
Next time you don't like one of my suggestions, - just tell me.
- I don't like your suggestions.
Okay, well, then you suggest something, and then I suggest something, and eventually we reach a compromise.
So let's try it.
Let's try it with the cabinets.
I suggest a lighter wood, like birch.
Absolutely not.
- I mean  - Mm-hmm.
I suggest a darker wood, like walnut.
So now we try to find something in the middle, like, how about oak?
That's fine, that's fine, I'm willing to go darker.
Cherry?
Mahogany?
- Walnut?
- I love that suggestion!
It was your suggestion.
It's not a compromise.
- Okay, fine, birch.
- No!
That was my suggestion.
That's still not a compromise.
Now you're confusing me!
JESS : Emergency off-site loft meeting!
Nick.
Nick, it's time for the final vote.
Where are you?
The motion now includes the Cece Parikh Hallway Decency Act.
Ugh!
There's still one nay in here!
- Okay, I voted yay, I swear.
- Then who was it?
WOMAN : Roughstuff Productions.
You have a real guilty look on your face a real nay face.
This is not my nay face.
This is this is how does a man compromise his vision face.
MAN : Roughstuff Productions, this is Clem.
Uh, yeah, Clem, um.
I'm calling about the whereabou -  - Winston!
-  Sir, are you auditioning?
- Admit it!
- Why?
- Oh Aah - Why?
- It doesn't matter who voted nay.
The message is clear, somebody doesn't want Reagan in the loft.
So who cares who did it?
Let's move on.
Who is that person?
I hate that person.
Also, maybe somebody realized moments before the vote that, if you think about it, my bed it-it tilts west.
And so she could roll off the bed in the middle of the night, and on the floor, - and my floor tilts east - Nick.
Which means she could roll under my bed and be lost forever.
- Did you vote nay?
- Yeah, of course I did.
I don't know what I want.
I'm confused.
Ooh-whee!
Politics!
Schmidt, you need to take these design blinders off and look around.
We compromise all the time.
We named our house Jaipur Aviv.
That's right.
I wanted to call it Ghatak/Mossad HQ, and you wanted to call it - Our House.
- Our House, yes.
We met in the middle and we called it Jaipur Aviv.
You know what, every compromise doesn't have to be 50-50.
I've been looking at cabinets online.
They all look exactly the same to me.
- No, they don't.
- They really do.
Birch, walnut, mahogany, fiberglass, stainless steel.
You can't tell the difference between metal and wood?
Not when it comes to a cabinet.
I just see cabinet, and then I go, like, "Oh, my plate's in there".
I think this is a bigger issue than interior design.
I think it just applies to cabinets.
And I accept the fact that I am not good at interior design, and you're brilliant at it.
So you should take the lead on that.
Just like I'm no good at cooking Indian food.
- Mm.
- You take the lead on that.
You always let me make dessert.
- I always burn it.
- I just want you to feel included.
Even if it's in just some small, symbolic way.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Do you know how anything works?
I know you whipped and you buttonholed and you swing-setted your tail off to get all these votes.
- Who did I swing-set?
- Once I got the votes, I panicked.
Because I realized that now I have to ask her, and what if she says no?
Or worse, what if she says yes, moves in with me, and then regrets it?
I wish we'd had this conversation at the beginning of the day, but yeah, I mean, I get it, it's scary.
Well, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.
- You know, tell me I should vote yay.
- Nick, I whipped everyone's votes.
I'm not gonna whip yours.
But whatever you decide, I support you.
We all do.
If I vote yay, all that means is is that I can ask her.
Emphasis on "can".
And that I don't have to.
Emphasis on "have".
Wow.
Well, no one loves parsing more than I do, and even I find this tedious, but yes.
All right, slide me over.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Whoa, is this wall just sticky, or is it magnetic?
We have got to get a magnetic wall.
We will never buy another coil of wires connected to a battery again in our lives.
It'll pay for itself in a week.
Okay, Roughstuff Productions referred me to their former subsidiary Tick Tock Erotica, LLC, which split from Roughstuff back in '09.
But here's the thing.
Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.
And they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.
- Did he know where they shot it?
- He did not.
All right, we've got to give up a secret.
The only question is who breaks the news.
I'll break the news if I get to pick the secret.
Deal.
But I really recommend that you tell him about - Halloween 2004.
- Halloween 2004.
That's what I was gonna say.
- Secrets exchanged.
- Secrets exchanged.
Shh.
WOMAN : I could never say no to the man that saved my sled dogs.
Schmidt, I need to tell you something - unpleasant about some candy you ate.
-  - What?
- Many years It was shot in Seattle.
Daddy's Longleg was shot in Seattle.
What's Daddy's Longleg?
A pornographic movie Winston and I really like.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- Because it was not filmed in your home.
So congratulations!
- Wow, we did it, honey.
- Was that in question?
Hey, did you ask Reagan?
I've decided to ask her, but I haven't asked her yet.
I don't know how to.
All I've got right now is, "Hey, Nickname" that's what we're calling each other until we can think of something better.
Uh and after that, I'm a little stumped.
Well, why do you want Reagan to move in?
Because I want to spend a lot of time with her, and if she moves in, I'll be able to spend more time with her.
Well, if she moved in, how would that make you feel, Nick?
- I'd feel honored.
- Honored or happy?
Both.
- And what's your name?
- My name is Nick.
- Probably could've got that on my own.
- Noted.
Wow.
I mean, that's perfect.
And it's already on my phone.
But there's just some things I want to agonize over out loud with you guys.
- And send.
- I wanted to agonize, - I said I needed to agonize - I've to tell you.
That was great.
- God bless you.
- You're welcome everyone.
About this porn you watched together
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 : I'm ready.
I'm ready!
Cece, good news.
I'm making you bar manager!
Yeah, I finally want to focus on my writing.
And you can implement all the ideas that you've been suggesting.
All I said was that the ladies' bathroom needs more toilet paper.
And I want you to implement that - as manager.
- All right.
Cece, this could be your whole future.
What do you say?
"Whole future" makes it seem like I'm gonna grow old and die there, - which is terrifying.
- Oh, yeah, - but yeah - I mean, I could use the money See, that's what I'm saying!
You could use the money!
If you break it down hourly, it's less money.
- Okay.
- Don't do that math.
- I'm fat!
- I'm ready!
Look at this scarf.
I used to be able to wrap this scarf - exactly - You go first.
two and a half times, and the plaid layers would blend seamlessly.
- Scarf looks fine, Schmidt.
- Now the blend is several degrees from seamless, a as you can see.
I've gained six pounds, maybe six and a half, I'm sure of it.
Honey, you look exactly the same to me.
Are you implying you gained six pounds in your neck?
I let my gym membership lapse when we were planning the wedding.
Now instead of a chiseled ten, I'm a dumpy seven breathin' down six's back.
But it's fine.
I just have to find a new gym.
Oh, you can come with me to mine I'll pick you up after work, okay?
Good.
Now back to my thing.
I'm ready!
Oh, sorry.
To start dating again.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- That's great.
I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.
Me, too.
About time you got Dr. Sam out of your system.
Here's a prescription for the doctor.
Who needs him?
: Keep talking.
Yes.
Totally about Dr. Sam and definitely not about any other specific individuals.
Anyway, I've spent the last few months self-improving my ass off and now I'm ready to get this bad boy back on the streets.
That's right.
I'm ready!
Schmidt, just so we're clear.
When you say you're a seven breathing down a six's back, : are you referring to Cece?
Is she the six?
Come on!
Flip it!
Flip it!
- Come on, Schmidt, flip it!
- Oh, forget it.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
I used to crush at the gym and now I'm just mediocre, like early BeyoncÃ©.
Nobody will say it, but you know it's true.
Look, you're just shaking the rust off.
You got to run the faucet till the brown runs out.
Speaking of which, I have to do the same.
Don't wait up.
Hey, squats, good news.
- I'm dating again.
- No, thank you.
- Never mind.
- Okay.
What the hell?
I used to be so good at dating.
I don't think you were.
I had a thing a certain type responded to.
Hey, Jess.
Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey.
- Robby, you go to this gym?
Oh, yeah.
Jess and I work out all the time.
In fact, everyone from our singles group works out here, too.
Jess, who am I right now?
Tony!
- Tony.
That's right.
Tony.
-   All right.
I'm gonna get a drink and get back to my workout, but, uh, you better be careful.
My I-I tore every single ligament in my right leg.
- The doctor says I have to focus -  on the top until it heals.
Yeah, classic genie workout.
Just let your legs waste away until they turn into mist.
Guess you got to lift weights like Tony sleeps.
-  No bottoms.
-  No bottoms.
We love Tony.
- All right.
- Check you later.
All right, got to get back on the horse.
Got to find a guy I can have some rhythm with.
Ooh.
Sweaty guy?
Oh.
Guy doing Pilates in work boots?
Are you doing a bit right now?
- What?
- Just date Robby.
Oh, Schmidt, not this again.
Why not?
I mean, you guys get along.
He's clearly into you.
You have that whole Tony thing, which was very inside and alienating.
Well, I do find Robby really funny and he's as tall as you can be before it's weird.
See, I'd put him on the wrong side of that line, but that's just me.
Who cares what I think?
Jess go get him.
Oh.
It's a colon drop?
Uh, I didn't order this.
Is it just me or is it colon here?
Yeah.
Hi, there.
Hey, the birds on your shirt look a little lonely.
Maybe they could use some company?
Nah.
They find it very fulfilling to play amongst themselves.
Find me if they change their mind.
Was she hitting on us?
Hey, what can give you?
I guess I'll get some calamari and some soup.
What's the soup of the day?
Actually, what I'm talking about?
This is my bar.
Who are you?
Oh, Nick, this is Donovan, the new bartender I hired.
- Hey.
- Hey, Donovan.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Uh, would you mind grabbing a-an extra keg?
Got it.
That's an interesting hire.
You-you see, bartenders are mostly, I don't know, grizzled guys, you know, with character or they're hot women who bring in grizzled guys with character.
I know.
He's actually an aspiring model and I figure he'll bring in more women.
How would he bring in more women?
Because he is super hot.
That guy is super hot?
- Yes.
- Okay, if you say so.
I don't say so.
The Lord says so.
That boy is off the charts.
- I wouldn't know.
- Okay, don't be that guy.
I'm not being that guy.
I don't see it.
Don't be the, "Eh, I wouldn't know" guy.
- It's a bad color on you.
- No, I'm not saying it's a color.
I'm not even making like I don't see that he's more handsome.
I have been getting all kinds of female attention lately.
Did I suddenly get more attractive?
How should I know?
!
I don't see that kind of thing.
- I'm just trying to write.
- Babe.
- Yeah, babe.
- Babe.
- Yes, babe?
- You have a girlfriend now, which means you've got a lot of confidence and women love that.
Now, if you'll just keep making it clear that you have a girlfriend, it'll pass.
I hate shutting women down all damn night.
I want to be a source of light in the world.
Well That's why I always sit at the table with the little kids first.
Man, that restaurant was so weird.
I feel like we were the only people not celebrating a birthday.
Well, it-it was called Birthdays.
- Birthday, birthday, birthday - How's the chicken?
- Sorry, what?
-  - How-how's your chicken?
- What?
I was just saying, "How is your chicken"?
Oh, yeah.
I have chicken.
Yes.
Yeah.
- I-I know you have it, but how - I ordered the chicken.
- What?
- I ordered the chicken!
Right, right, right.
Is it good, though?
It was a loud, horrible restaurant.
- Sorry.
- So why did I have so much fun?
- Probably the company.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Ow.
What?
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
I guess.
- Well, night, pal.
- Oh.
- Be well.
- Okay.
Uh Jess, why are you not dressed for the gymnasia?
- Hmm.
I'm not going.
- Why the hell not?
- Oh, is it your birthday?
- No.
I just Did we forget your birthday?
This is terrible.
- It's not my birthday.
- It's a big one, too, isn't it?
How old do you think I No, I'm eating leftovers from my date with Robby.
Did you go to Birthdays?
You know, if you get a chance, you should try the Birthdays Express at the airport.
I like it better.
It's del Anyway, how was your date?
It was great and then it was disastrous.
- Oh, so you had sex with him?
- No.
The opposite.
The opposite?
So, you gave birth to him?
No.
It was going really well.
It was fun and then at the end, he clearly wanted to kiss and I thought I did, too, and then instead I just gave him the old Pittsburgh good-bye.
Chuck on the arm and a handshake?
- Why would you do that?
- Because, I  In that moment, I just couldn't see myself spending the rest of my life with him.
80 years old, feeding him pea soup out of a tin cup.
I'm confused.
Is this a happy ending for Jess Day?
I mean, where are you living at this point, under a bridge?
I see you and Cece and Nick and Reagan - and Winston and Furguson - Aly.
Sorry, that just came out.
Winston and Aly.
And you're all in love, and I just don't know if I'll ever have that magic with Robby.
See, this just proves my theory that if you were a man, you would have a very difficult time getting an erection.
You have a theory about that?
You're putting way too much pressure on yourself.
It's a date, it's not the rest of your life.
- You had a good time, right?
- Well, yeah, it was Robby.
He's the funniest guy in the world.
So lighten up.
If you want to kiss him, kiss him.
Who knows maybe you'll see if you have magic then.
You know what?
You're right.
I was gonna try to avoid Robby, but funk that chicken!
I'm gonna go get my gym clothes on!
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna put my push-up bra on.
That's actually not a bra that pushes my breasts up, it's actually one that I do push-ups in.
- I get it.
- Smash these babies down.
Let's do it.
Ooh, no, Cece, you know it's not Jess' birthday, right?
- Put that away.
- Yeah, no, I know that.
Um, this gift is for you.
- What?
- Mm-hmm.
Cece It's a scarf.
- Yeah.
- I love it.
Almost makes me want to go to Buffalo for work.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Look at look at that.
Oh, no.
O-oh, no.
Oh, no!
How long does she think my freakin' neck is?
It's a fat-man scarf.
My wife gave me a fat-man scarf!
I did a few freelance modeling gigs.
I was the "wowee face" for an amusement park ad.
: That's actually really great.
- Oh, that was you.
- We really gotta get you working.
Let me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.
- Do some model looks.
- All right.
Um, this one I call, "I just saw something patriotic".
All right - It was an eagle.
- I was gonna say eagle.
I want to show some range.
Show me "I just saw something unpatriotic".
How you gonna pull that off?
Oh.
That's some rich gravy, man.
I noticed you from across the way.
Can I buy you a drink?
I'm sorry, but let me be very clear.
I have a girlfriend.
, and I am very much so devoted to her.
Aw.
Here's my number.
Use it.
She didn't listen to a word Throw a peanut out of frustration!
Okay, why are you even here?
I thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.
I would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.
This is insane you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.
I do How would I know?
Nick, please, that dude is hot as hell, man.
He is a member of the Hall of Fine.
He's more attractive than Joe Mangaroni.
Manga Joe Menden - Who are you thinking of?
- Magic Mike's friend.
- Oh, he's married to that - Yeah, J Lo.
- Joe Mangallini.
- Joe Mangallini.
He's more attractive than Joe Mangallini.
Okay, I know for a fact that this was the most attractive man in America for ten years.
I know that because magazines told me so.
- But - Okay Hey, Donovan, could you copy that?
You guys don't look anything alike.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Are you planning on speeding up at any point?
Oh, my God, Schmidt, are you walking on a decline?
This is what we call a "trudge," Jess.
My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?
Uh, license and registration, please.
I had a great time last night, you know?
And thank you for taking that cake off my hands.
I would have eaten it for breakfast.
- Huh, gross, right?
-  Better get back to my uppers.
By the time this knee is fixed, I'm gonna look like the WB frog, you know?
: Ba da bup a duh breeer.
That guy You're the only two people in here that enjoyed that.
Please go after him.
Hey, need a spot?
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great, thanks.
Hey, Jess, about last night, at the end there, - I hope I wasn't - No, you weren't, and I hope you didn't think that I just kinda thought that we were in synch, you know?
- But then - No, Robby I wanted to kiss you, too.
You did?
Oh Oh, well, Jess, I don't know if this is Oh, okay.
- Somebody call an ambulance.
- Robby, are you okay?
I don't know, Robby hurt his mouth pretty bad here.
It hurts a lot.
It felt good first, but then it hurts a lot now.
Just so you know, this is all your fault.
Oh, that's fair.
I should have made it very clear to you not to kiss Robby while he was balancing a dangerous amount of weight above his head.
There was a moment before the bar came down where we were just two people kissing, and nothing.
No magic.
Look, at least now you know.
No harm done, right?
A tremendous amount of harm done.
Now I have to tell a man I maimed that I'm not interested.
On the bright side, you're not that hurt.
Come to think of it, how are you not more hurt?
When I was in triage, they said that my neck muscles had served as kind of a neck helmet, which made me feel like I was not talking to real doctors.
Anyway, I just have to wear this thing for the next few days just as a precaution.
Well, if you want to cover it up, Cece gave me a scarf that's perfect.
It's long enough to wrap around an above-ground pool filled with Alfredo sauce.
Alfredo sauce.
Doesn't that sound good?
- Not really.
- I don't know.
Maybe Cece's right.
Maybe I am turning into a fat man.
Cece never called you fat.
Well, I am.
I'm a fat man married to a hot woman.
Cool, I'm a sitcom.
That sounds like a great show.
Throw in a wacky neighbor, I'm watching.
Maybe the reason why you don't want to go to the gym is 'cause you want to hang out with your beautiful wife.
Right?
And you're fat and happy because you're happy.
You're right.
I'm a lucky man.
A Lucky Man should be the name of your show.
You're a beleaguered casino owner, and a father of three.
-  Ms. Day?
- Yes?
Mr. McFerrin's regained consciousness.
- Oh, thank goodness.
- You can see him now.
Thank you.
All right.
You should go home, this could be a long conversation.
WOMAN'S  Two-four-seven-seven, satellite pharmacy Wait a minute.
Robby's full name is Robby McFerrin?
How did I not put this together?
- Hey.
- Hey.
I met with that photographer you sent me to.
It went great.
I mean, he even gave me a free bottle of water.
Ooh.
- I felt like a movie star.
-  - He wants to work together.
- That's amazing.
I got these release forms to sign.
You want me to take a look at them for you?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
There we go.
Donovan, these terms are unacceptable.
He's really screwing you.
- Aww - You know what?
I'm gonna get on the phone with him, because if we start treating our attractive people like this, our society is gonna collapse.
Hey, man, you busy writing?
- What does it look like?
- Want a rain-stick?
Some girl gave it to me.
You know, I'm getting a lot of gifts from women who want to sleep with me lately.
You know?
It's hopeless, man.
I'm so damn confident.
Winston, I was really hoping to make headway on this, but uh, we got to put out this fire, don't we?
- It's hot.
- Hmm.
- You're too confident.
- Too confident ain't the word.
I'm at a whole new level.
Do you remember when you were taking the bus to the farmer's market and it hit a bump and you soiled yourself?
That was not my favorite Arbor Day.
Why you, uh why are you bringing that up?
Remember when you, uh, were in the park, and a bee flew into your mouth and then you fell off the bridge at that place where all the ducks go to the bathroom?
I see what you're doing.
Keep it going.
Remember when you had to leave Latvia because you weren't good enough to be a professional basketball player, and you came back home to be a full time babysitter?
Okay.
All right.
Time out.
- You know, you, you hit a nerve.
- Okay.
- Definitely brought me down a peg.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I needed it.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I feel some less confident now.
- My man.
- : All right, then.
All right.
Back to my novel.
- You're still on that?
- I can't figure it out.
Look.
Imagine a world where you woke up one morning and instead of your face, - you had Donovan's face.
- Whoa.
And instead of your body, you had his.
How would you feel?
- If I had his face and his body?
- Oh-hoo, yeah.
I'd feel fantastic.
And that's how you know he's attractive.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
Can I have a minute with this, please?
Oh, sure thing.
Can I interest you in some white noise?
Yes, please.
Hmm.
So, when a man looks like a man that you wouldn't mind looking like, that's a way to assess a man's attractiveness.
- Exactly.
- Oh!
That's right.
You are gonna draw up a brand new agreement for Donovan to sign.
Hell, yeah, you're gonna have a courier bring it over to me right now.
And, uh, listen closely, Marco, Donovan subsection H is a deal breaker, so, rip it out of the agreement and burn it.
Or we're walking.
Look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks, bye.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.
That was amazing.
WOMAN'S  Allen to pulmonary medicine.
Dr. Allen to Hey, Robby.
- Hi, Jess.
- Oh!
- You don't look so bad.
- Mm-hmm Oh, don't smile.
Don't smile.
- You make me want to smile.
- Don't!
You'll pop a stitch.
- Don't smile.
I'm so sorry.
- No, don't be.
It was worth it, Jess, because what happened between us was so magical.
A dark magic, maybe.
- Can I make a confession?
- I wish you wouldn't.
- When I was under - Here we go.
I saw a bright light.
And I felt that I had the choice to either go into the light or to come back to you.
And well, here we are.
Mm this is gonna be a tough one.
- You know what's so great?
- No.
I don't.
Our first kiss is gonna be such a good story to tell.
It's not that good of a story.
Pretty good story.
Robby, I have something to tell you.
- I - Mm-hmm?
-  -  Oh, my God!
Your bad knee!
Oh, my God!
- I'll get someone to help.
-  Aah Oh!
: Mm.
There she is.
Jess.
Big news.
I realized that you were right.
I'm happy because Cece loves me and she's gonna love me no matter what, even if I turn into a bloated Ashkenazi marshmallow.
Turns out, I don't have to work out ever again.
I can eat as much as I want and still be happy.
Ooh.
How'd your thing go?
- Break the news to Robby?
- No.
Before I could break his heart, I shattered his leg.
It's now in two pieces, connected by a skin tunnel where his knee should be.
Hmm.
So, you've broken him twice now.
How am I supposed to tell him I'm not interested now?
I don't think you have any other choice.
I mean, what are you gonna do?
You're just gonna pretend to be into him and then nurse him for the rest of your life?
- Okay, Robby, time for your soup.
-  Good morning.
In a strange way, I find this to be deeply romantic.
Yes.
It's very romantic, waiting for his body to heal before I destroy his soul.
Cling, clung, I got a robot dong.
I got a robot dong goes cling, cling, cling - You got to love Robby.
- He's been singing that a lot.
- Cece.
- Hmm?
You've done a great job, but I'm gonna have to demote you.
- Huh?
- Shouldn't be a manager, because you should be a manager.
Are you just saying words in no particular order?
We asked Donovan to bring in a couple of his "hottest friends".
And he sure did.
And I know that because I wouldn't mind having their faces.
And I wouldn't mind having their bodies.
- Okay.
-  We saw you on the phone with that photographer, and you have a gift.
You shouldn't be managing a bar.
You should be managing people like Donovan.
Beautiful idiots?
- No offense.
- Oh.
And these objectively handsome men.
They're models, too.
Just like me.
Me, managing models?
Just like him and him and him.
Yeah.
They're all models just like him.
Well, I do know the business.
- And I hate working here.
- Easy.
I mean, I'm gonna keep working here.
I need the cash.
Schmidt is eating us out of house and home.
Barkeep!
Mudslide, extra whip.
Coming right up, babe.
You know what?
All right.
- I think that I'll do it.
- Ha, ha!
Okay, guys.
Let's see what you're working with.
I actually just meant show me a portfolio but that'll do.
: Where's my mudslide?
- Who are these?
- My new clients.
Honey, I think I'm gonna start managing models.
Are you rea that's a that's amazing.
Congratulations, Cece.
I think you'd be really great at that.
- I'm proud of you.
- Yeah?
So, you'll just be swimming in beefcakes all day and then you'll just be coming home to this sock full of meatloaf.
Uh-huh, sister.
Not gonna happen.
I'm going back to the gym.
Don't need this fat man scarf.
- Want help?
You got it?
- You didn't like my gift?
It just goes on forever.
You literally just got to take it off.
- Why'd you do that?
-  Hey!
What am I missing?
Cece's gonna manage models.
I can't hear anything from over here.
I'm gonna come over.
- You guys are really good looking.
- Thank you, man.
- Not you.
These three.
- Oh.
Don't celebrate without me.
-  -  Oh!
- Oh, sorry!
Oh.
Sorry.
- You got to Oh!
-  Okay - Just move your foot a little bit - Aah, you just - I can't get it out.
- Okay, one of us should help.
- I know, we should help.
- Can you just lift your foot a little bit -  That way, that way.
You're hurting him.
Go like this.
- Oh!
Sorry!
- Go like this!
Go like No.
That's not helping.
Oh, aah!
Sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Welcome to the ceremonial lighting of the first burner.
Come on, Susan!
- There it is!
-  - Aah!
- Thanksgiving!
- It is 7:00 A.M. - I've actually been up for two hours.
Let's do this!
Perfect Thanksgiving!
Reagan's coming today, and I want everything to be great for the guest of honor.
Oh, the the guest of honor?
Yeah, the guest of honor.
I guess my dad spending Thanksgiving with me for the first time ever is a non-event.
Ooh.
Is he bringing his new squoosh?
- Hmm?
- Is that a thing people say?
- No.
- Uh-uh.
Well, his squoosh has a name, and it's Ann Kim.
She's probably gonna want to spend some time with you ladies, too, because you know how fathers and sons can be on Thanksgiving.
Drinking beer, watching the game, hugging each other in a way that suggests, "I forgive you for every for everything".
Okay, look, I know you're excited, but maybe don't put so much pressure on it, you know?
I mean, we all we all know who your dad is.
Who he was.
Who he was, though.
Just don't expect too much.
Just be happy that he's coming at all.
- So what time's Robby coming?
- He's not coming.
- He is going to visit his folks.
- What's your guys' deal now?
Are you actually together, or are you just nursing him back to health 'cause you broke his entire body and face?
We are not together, but I don't think Robby understands that.
I wonder why, Jess.
You only hang out with him 24/7.
Come on, baby, make it hurt so  I feel mean telling him we're not dating when he's in this state.
It is a lot meaner to lead him on, okay?
- You got to drop the hammer.
- I know.
You're right.
I'll do it next time I see him.
I'm just dreading it.
He's such a good egg.
I mean, with his dad khakis and his glasses and his his his sweet little change purse.
You know what?
That's it.
He's too nice.
There's just no oomph.
Yeah.
It's non-negotiable.
You got to have the oomph.
Yeah, oomph was all Cece and I had when we started oomphing.
Oh, "oomph" is sex.
Why say that stupid word?
Just say "sex".
Oh, because it's more than that, Nick.
It's fire.
It's passion.
It's ha-cha-cha-cha-cha - cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
- Mm.
And there's no ha-cha-cha with Robby.
He's too nice.
Well, look, Jess, do what you got to, but I love that guy.
Robby was there for me when I got hurt in the line of duty.
Winston, you sprained your ankle running for a bagel.
- Yeah.
I was at work, though.
- Running for a bagel.
Look, Robby's the only one who understands my pain.
Well, nothing makes me happier than cooking for ten hours and eating in under 25 minutes.
Chant me in.
ALL : Stuff that bird!
Stuff that bird!
Stuff that bird!
Guess who's too injured to fly?
Is it you?
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, I feel I feel like I'm holding the long end of the wishbone right now, but, um, why wouldn't they let you on the plane?
There was a fit issue.
I'm sorry.
All right.
I'm so sorry.
-  Oh!
Oh!
Sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
- Whoa.
Whoa.
-  Aah!
No, no, no, it's fine.
- Oh!
Oh!
Well, at least you had the fun of going to the airport on Thanksgiving.
- And I get to hang out with you.
-  Yay!
And boo!
Because I already have plans with a 15-pound cutie.
- I'm talking about the turkey.
-  Listen, I'm gonna plant you in front of the parade, and you're gonna yell out what balloons go by!
Okay.
Okay.
MAN : The start of the parade just  With the speed?
!
He like Mayweather with the knife!
Okay, what is going on?
Because you don't even use a knife to eat a steak?
Well, my girl is coming.
Of course my hands are dancing.
These knives are a part of me like that, uh, scissor hand guy.
What is his name again?
Is it Rick Snip?
- Did you drop the hammer?
- I have not dropped the hammer.
Snoopy!
Saw Snoopy.
Okay, no.
You-you got to end this.
False alarm.
It's just John Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.
Drop the hammer now?
He can't even tell the difference between John Stamos and Snoopy.
You can't break a man's heart on a holiday.
I'm telling you, it happened to me once, and that pain it comes back year after year after year.
You don't want to do that to him, I'm telling you.
That's why I'm always a hot mess on take-your-daughter-to-work day.
Uh-oh.
It's the senior citizens choir.
Get the tissues!
Look, I'll tell you what, Jess.
I'll keep him busy for the day.
- You can destroy him tomorrow.
- Thank you, Winston.
You know what?
Next take-your-daughter-to-work-day is gonna be take-Winston-out- for-spaghetti day.
I would enjoy that.
I would enjoy that for real.
Ooh, it's my daddy!
It's my daddy!
Gobble, gobble.
Happy Thanksgiving, son.
I hope you're ready, 'cause I have a full day planned for us.
First up is a game of American football featuring the Cowboys of Dallas.
I'm sorry.
It's our first Thanksgiving together.
Look, I've been crying all morning, too.
It's this is a good thing.
Ann Kim broke up with me.
Oh, no.
Excuse me.
Da  Gavin!
Happy Thanksgiving.
-  Hey, Gavin.
- It just got a whole lot happier.
Excuse me.
Daddy?
You remember when you tongue-kissed that guy?
MAN : Now this marching band has traveled 1,500 miles What you taking?
Little boy blues?
Yeah, I've been there.
How many miggies you working with?
Yeah, my pharmacist bumped me up to nine.
1,400.
Yeah.
I have to take 18 pills an hour in a very specific order, and they virtually assured me that I will be addicted to them.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey, what happened to Rick Snip?
Uh, gone and, uh  these tears honestly, they're from the onions.
They're not from Reagan bailing.
Oh, no.
Reagan's not coming?
No.
She just called.
Uh, her boss sent her to Omaha, so she can't make it, but it's fine.
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.
I also wear a slow-release opium patch on my spine.
Hey, I ever told you the story of how I got injured in the first place?
- Yes.
- One may think that it started because of a lack of bagels, but no.
It started with a surplus - of cream cheese.
- Of cream cheese.
Yes, yes, you're familiar with such happening.
You know what?
I think Jess told me to help her No, no, no, no.
You're good.
Uh, lock you up.
I'm sure she's bummed, too.
- How long is she gonna be there?
- No idea.
I didn't ask.
I just said, "Happy Thanksgiving".
And then I hung up.
Okay, you're gonna have to leave the kitchen.
The whole sad-guy, whiskey-flame combination is starting to worry me.
Let me know when my whiskey boils down to a crystal so I can eat it.
Hey, Dad, are you okay in there?
Did you fall in?
That's a dad joke that I would've assumed I would have heard you make had you been around more.
I want you to know I'm not using the bathroom.
I'm just sitting here.
Hey, Dad, you know what's a great cure for heartache?
A little father-and-son time.
You know, we could have a catch, whittle a stick.
- Why don't you just come out?
-  I'm sorry, son.
You're right.
Today is about family.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Exactly.
There's my favorite whiskey glass.
- Aah.
Who wants to get wasted?
- Me.
So badly.
Ugh.
I'm so sorry, babe.
Yeah.
No.
I'm-I'm fine.
Look, we don't wear sweaters and roll around in the leaves, but there are other ways for us to bond.
If he wants to drink, then, you know what?
I'm gonna drink.
I'm gonna get sloppy with my poppy.
Nick.
Papa!
Wait for me.
Just need to get my bitters kit.
Ooh, actually, can you just make sure that there's a garbage can next to the bed?
Because I can't hang.
Robby!
What are you doing here with me and not with Winston?
I like Winston, but he's been telling this bagel story for ten minutes.
I haven't even met all the main characters yet.
Plus, I have a little surprise for you.
To make up for this morning, the airline gave me two free tickets to anywhere in the contiguous 48 states.
Oh.
Ha.
Well, I'd love to, you know, plan our future, but we're eating in under four hours, and so I have to put you to work.
Okay, you just, crouton.
- Oh.
- All right.
Keep croutonning.
Okay, I'm not that close to the table.
Darn it.
- I was just in the bathroom -  Nothing but net.
with my husband and his father.
Are you also having a good Thanksgiving?
Hey, Jess.
Check this out.
Did that go in?
- Robby got plane tickets, - Swish.
- and he wants to whisk my away, - Nothing but bowl.
once he gets better, which could be months from now.
Jess, I'm looking up some hotels right now.
Twin bed's okay, right?
Hammer time?
Hammer time.
- Cheers.
- Yes, sir.
Ah.
This is the dream.
A boy, his dad, his best friend sharing a drink.
Don't tell Mom, right?
: I'm just kidding.
I know you and Mom haven't spoken in 30 years, including my wedding.
You know what's stupid?
There's a part of me that actually thought I might have a wedding with Ann Kim someday.
I don't think that's stupid at all, Dad.
I think that's beautiful.
You know, you opened up your heart to Ann Kim and that's brave.
Maybe she was just scared.
You know women.
They're a mystery.
Yeah, sometimes they just go to Omaha and you don't know when they're gonna come back.
Or if they're coming back.
How do you even know she's in Omaha?
Oh, because, uh, she said she was.
- Nothing means anything.
- Nothing means anything.
Nothing means anything.
At least you're young, Nick.
You got a rocking bod with kickass buns.
You're not gonna have any problems.
Who's gonna want an old guy like me?
I've got garbage buns.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
Dad, you've got fantastic buns.
- You think?
- I'm telling you, you've got nothing to worry about.
Nick, stand up, put your buns next to each other, so here.
What is happening here?
I'm not doing anybody any favors today.
I'm a bummer.
Probably the best thing I could do would be to head home.
See you later, man, nice to see you again.
Dad, stay.
Look you're gonna land on your feet.
I've see I've seen all kinds of women throw themselves at you.
Lifeguards and teachers, lens crafters.
Remember when you had your tongue in Jess' mouth?
She tasted like licorice sweet but with a bite.
Not you're not helping, Nick.
Actually, you know what?
Can I see you in the hallway, please?
Why?
Nick, we have got to go to Ann Kim's house and convince her to give my dad a second chance.
- It's the only way he's gonna stay.
- She's not gonna come.
She's a snake.
All women are snakes.
I understand that you're spinning out about Reagan.
I'm spinning out about Reagan.
I get it.
But you have to help me save my Thanksgiving with my dad.
You're right.
I'm so sorry.
We can pull this off.
If we get her to take him back - We'd be heroes.
- That's right.
Look at that, Mom, I'm gonna be a hero.
Why are you looking up?
Your mother is still alive.
I'm looking at Chicago.
You think Chicago is up?
It's north.
Robby, you're a great guy, but nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
However, someday you're gonna open a really wonderful bed and breakfast.
- That was pretty good.
- I mean, right?
Can you imagine the wine and cheese hour he would put on?
Stuff the toga with hot coals.
- We're going out.
- What?
Wait.
Have a place setting at the table for Ann Kim, but don't seat her next to my dad.
I want all the couples split up.
Everybody gets to talk that way, but, uh - and then put me next to Nick.
- Yeah.
And then my dad next to me as well.
So I'm sandwiched between Nick and my dad.
You guys can't leave.
We need you here.
Well, I need a happy daddy.
He needs a happy daddy.
If they never come back, the last words I'll have heard my husband say are "happy daddy".
Okay, good luck.
Oh, smells great.
That's just my famous gravy.
The trick is, um, a pinch of brown sugar and then a couple more handfuls of brown sugar.
Actually, uh, just a lot of brown sugar.
Ann Kim loves gravy.
Big dogs, small horses, the smell of rain, and gasoline.
Oh, Gavin.
You're a handsome and passionate and charismatic man.
You and me.
We really had something.
What do you say we give it another shot?
Let's just drive and drive and drive.
I know what I'm not thankful for this year.
This.
This is it.
- Robby, this is not what it looks - Don't say anything.
I-I don't even know where to begin, so I'll just start by saying that is smells delicious in here.
I'm gonna leave.
Just hold on a second.
-  -  Hey, Ann Kim, show your face.
You cold-hearted zombie.
- Who's down there?
- It's Gavin's son.
I don't know if you remember this, but we went on a double date once.
My wife got terribly ill from some truffle oil.
Rich foods don't agree with her.
Did Gavin send you?
No, no, no.
He doesn't even know that I'm here.
Look, Ann Kim, he's heartbroken.
You opened up something inside of him, and you turned him into the man that I always knew that he could be.
And darn it, I'm just a kid  hoping for a Thanksgiving miracle.
Why don't you give him a second chance and come back with us, and let's all give thanks together.
Great speech.
Yeah, it really was a great speech, man.
Thanks.
Did you do it with the five other women he's dating?
What?
That's why he always refers to me by my first and last name, because he's dating two Anns.
This is worse than my Reagan thing.
I can't believe that I spent all day feeling sorry for that son of a bitch.
I guess I'm the son of a bitch.
Leave or I'm hitting the sprinklers.
Ann Kim, please, give me a minute to process this.
- Sprinklers!
- That was not a minute!
- Sprinklers!
- That was not a minute!
No!
Hello, Jessica.
If you're here to hurt Robby, then you're here to hurt me.
And if you hurt me, then I'm gonna hurt Robby.
Wait a minute.
No.
If you're here If you don't get out of your room, I'm gonna bleach all your bird shirts.
- Robby, I got to go.
- That's a wise choice.
Robby, I need you to know that there is  nothing going on between me and Gavin, except for an icy awkwardness that will continue until one or both of us is dead.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, I was sitting here thinking, really?
Schmidt's dad.
I know.
That'd be crazy, right?
Although I totally get it.
I mean  he's got that rakish charm.
And that voice.
Oh, my God.
- Great buns and - Robby, stop.
There's more.
Oh, boy.
I think I know where this is going.
Let me guess.
You see me as more of a friend.
Well, I didn't want to talk about it on Thanksgiving.
But you brought the tickets and Jess, it's okay.
I get it.
You know, there has to be that, um - Oomph?
- Yeah.
I was gonna say "yowza," but, uh, oomph.
You can't force the oomph, you know?
I'll take my mom to Phoenix.
She's nuts about Phoenix.
Well, congrats, Dad!
Holiday's over!
You ruined another Thanksgiving!
I can't believe that you're seeing six women.
- What's going on?
- How do you run a vineyard?
Not well.
I'm seeing six women.
He tried to make it seven.
I caught him making a move on Jess.
Again?
Why is my father so sexual?
- Why is he asking Chicago?
- Good question.
You know what, Gavin, if this is who you really are, then you can forget about Thanksgiving and all the holidays and all the non-holidays.
Pretty much what I'm talking about is every day.
Hey, hey, hey, guys, let's remember the reason for the season.
We're all very thankful.
Jess, I am so sorry.
I had no idea you two were together.
I thought you were his physical therapist.
Physical therapist?
Aren't you a physical therapist or something?
You think she's a Jess is a top-notch vice principal.
-  -  Oh, Robby Robby, no.
Don't stand.
Your-your knee.
I don't give a flying care about that.
I stand up when I stand up for people.
I think you're getting roid rage.
I didn't take any steroids today, because the TSA took 'em this morning.
Now, what you're seeing is pure, unfiltered Robby, straight from the tap.
Get him, Robby.
You-you tried to make Jess the seventh woman you're dating, and you don't even know the first thing about her.
I mean, did-did you know that when she was six she tried to eat a lightning bug so that her heart would glow like E.T.?
Did you know that she tried to give herself Lyme disease out of solidarity to her fourth grade classmate?
Or-or that she never lets any of her electronics go below 25%, just in case someone else needs to use them?
I mean, did you know did you know that she's terrified of the large bubbles in the bubble wrap but she loves the little tiny ones?
It's so cute, man.
It would be one thing if you actually had feelings for Jess - I'm I'm - Oh!
- Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh.
Thank you.
But you don't.
Y-you're just desperate and lonely and you're trying to use her, and I - Oh, it's happening again.
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, oh.
Thank you.
You can't use Jess, because she is a dream girl.
Here's the last thing I'll say before I leave.
Jess, I know it's not me, but  you deserve somebody who knows how special you are.
Um, I'm going.
I'm going.
Don't go, Robby.
I'm not going out.
I'm-I'm going down!
- Robby, no!
- Turkey!
Turkey's down!
- Robby!
Robby!
- Turkey's down!
Oh, God!
- Relax!
-  -  Just - Okay.
It still looks good!
The turkey still looks good.
-  -  - Wait, what are you - It is hot!
My skin!
- It's burning my skin!
- The hell you doing?
!
It was hot!
It was hot!
Now I got to eat a dirty turkey!
What's wrong with you?
This is all my fault.
- You know I throw hot things!
- I'm so sorry.
- It was fine!
- Turkey's expensive!
- Any more?
- This isn't on me!
Furguson don't eat turkey from the ground!
Oh, no.
I'm not taking the fall for this one.
- It's all on you!
- I'm not taking the Hey!
Can we not yell at each other on Thanksgiving?
!
I recognize that I, too, am yelling.
And I'm-I'm sorry, Robby.
Wait.
-  -  Great, he's gone.
I was just starting to feel it.
- Go.
- Yeah, Jess, go.
- Go.
- Go!
- Go after him.
- Save us some floor turkey.
Hey.
Look, I know you had high hopes for Thanksgiving with your dad.
You called it.
The guy is who he is.
You know, maybe you just need to drop this idea that he'll ever be the bigger man.
I think that needs to be you, babe.
You're the bigger man.
Son, I know you're probably tired of hearing both these statements and not likely to believe either, but I'm leaving and I'm sorry.
Dad, I said I said a lot of things earlier.
I don't want you out of my life.
I was waiting for you to be someone who you're not, but I know who you are and I still love you.
But you-you need to listen to me, son to father, get a therapist.
- Oh, I have a therapist.
- A better one.
Okay.
And I shouldn't have to say this but one that you're not sleeping with.
Okay.
Wait!
Robby!
Robby, don't go.
I tried to Irish good-bye, but, uh, I'm moving a little slow.
When you were in there and you were saying all those things, I realize I don't even really know you.
And I want to get to know you.
Jess, it's okay.
I-I don't want you to force something that's not there.
I felt it.
You felt the oomph?
Yes.
I  I'm sorry I'm being so confusing.
I-I think I'm as bad at Thanksgiving as I am at starting new relationships.
- Yeah, you're pretty bad.
- Robby, will you go on another date with me?
Come on, baby, make it hurt so good.
Hell yeah, I'll go on another date with you.
Hmm.
I did already tell my mom about Phoenix though.
- I hope that's okay.
- Oh, of course.
I apologize in advance for the state of our main course.
Dad, would you like to do the honors?
I think the man of the house traditionally does that.
I am a house Aw.
Out of twigs and stones I'm the m I'm the man of the house.
Would you look at that?
-  - Oh, it's Reagan.
Oh, whoa.
You know, I've always wanted to do this.
Uh, read out loud.
FEMALE  In Omaha.
Heart emoji.
Smiling pile of poo emoji.
I want my tongue emoji on your monkey emoji.
Eh, come on, that's a little private.
S-Sorry about that.
She wants to tongue your monkey?
What's your monkey?
Smiling pile of poo?
Oh, my God, Schmidt and Cece will be in a new home next year.
Next year it's at our place.
Happy last loft Thanksgiving, everyone.
Give and give They weren't always perfect, but they were memorable.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Mmm.
Remember when you fell down that hole?
Oh, and Schmidt cooked the meal in our dead neighbor's kitchen.
- : Ms. Beverly.
- Mmm!
Remember when we had sex with strangers?
That's a misrepresentation of what happened.
Remember when your parents made it in the bathroom?
Or last Thanksgiving, when we all accidentally took peyote and, Winston, you wouldn't let us break the wishbone.
- Break the bone, lose the wish.
- That's not true!
- That's not how it works.
- That is not how it works.
Here's to Thanksgiving, everybody.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 Babe, can you help me finish this thank you card to Asha Auntie?
She got us that.
-  That porpoise porn?
- Yeah.
"Best, comma, Cece and Schimdt".
All we're gonna give her is a "Best, comma"?
Come on, she's my mom's sister.
Well, she should have stuck to the registry.
You know who hasn't even gotten us a present yet?
- I have a year.
- He has a year.
- I have a year!
-  All right, everyone.
Report to the principal's office, where I will be sitting behind the desk because I might be principal!
- Congrats!
- That's great!
What do you mean, could be principal?
Well, I just had a very interesting talk with my boss, Genevieve.
Jess, - I am dying.
- What?
Oh, my God!
Dying to leave Banyon Canyon and launch my own elementary school at sea.
Oh.
You scared the bejesus out of me.
I've wanted this forever and I came so close at my last school.
Like, champagne and Prosecco close.
So, if you find marijuana in a locker, it's yours now.
Ours now.
It could just be part of the loft.
We could just put it in a Congratulations.
You just got yourself two weeks detention, Mr. Miller.
What?
But I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!
Principal, that's great.
I'm really proud of you.
And now you're almost gonna make what normal people make.
But I'm not even in it for the cabbage.
I want to change lives.
And finally, I can implement some of my programs school-wide, like the math decathlon the demathlon.
A-ha!
You see this whole time, y'all thought you were having breakfast with Winston, but it turns out y'all been sitting with James Wonder.
I'm talking about my alias.
See, I'm thinking about applying for undercover work.
That sounds incredibly dangerous.
Well, not if I go deep enough into my undercover character.
I've been practicing on y'all unknowin' asses.
I combined the names of my favorite singers Stevie Wonder and James Blunt.
And I put those together to create a different name as my alias, James Wonder.
I'm worried you're not the undercover type of guy.
I feel like if you had the ability to pretend to be someone else, you would have made that decision a long time ago.
I feel like that sounded harsh, but it's only 'cause I care about you.
I love Parents' Day!
Matching names to e-mail addresses, puttin' big people in little chairs.
Admiring all that sweet daddy derriere.
- Yeah, I'm not doing that.
- Good.
More for me.
Ooh.
That is Ed Warner.
President of the parent's council.
You're gonna need his vote if you want to become principal, so - Okay, did you talk me up?
- Absolutely not.
School politics gets messy and as my grandmother used to say, "You don't get dirty till after 6:30".
Piece of cake.
Parents love me.
Ed!
Oh, are-are you okay?
: Sorry, I was, uh, moved to tears by the second grader's self-portraits.
I cannot believe you are gonna abandon us next year.
- Oh - I'm like, "Ah, don't go"!
: I can keep the accent so you'll barely notice she's gone.
Prince Henry, pet me corgi.
Wow.
Um, Ed, have you met our vice principal?
Jessica Day.
I'm a big fan of your work and by your work, I mean the child you created.
Not to suggest that it was work making her.
I'm sure it was fun.
I mean I hope it was fun.
Ed, if you're gonna ask me sex advice, please buy me a glass of wine first.
Anyway, switching gears.
I'd love to discuss the, uh, principal vacancy.
As would I. N-not now.
Now's not a great time.
I have, um, uh Goodbye.
You beefed it, love.
You beefed it hard.
Is that the Vitalstir 3,000 from my registry?
Oh, no, I've had - I've had this forever.
- It came out last year.
Did it?
I've had it for a year.
No, I'm just doing what I always do.
Nicky Miller makin', uh, his famous guacamole.
Like I always do.
Nick Miller's famous guacamole.
See ya later.
I'll call you when it's done!
- Fine.
-  It's from your registry.
I bought it, I brought it home but I can't give it to you.
I am freaking out about what to get you.
Well, Nick why don't you just give us this blender that's on the list of stuff that I want?
Because I feel trapped by this registry.
It's a list made by robots.
Nick, not everything is robots!
Winston puts one walkie-talkie into a mailbox ROBOTIC  Thank you for your letter.
Yum!
I just you guys are like my family.
I want to get you something great.
Something unique, personal.
Oh, Nick.
And while you clearly don't understand what a registry is  I appreciate the sentiment.
Nick I don't say this lightly - I release you from the registry.
- Great.
Buy us a gift of your choosing.
What-what I want to get you.
Whatever you want.
The world is yours.
Fly, my little hummingbird.
'Cause I can get you anything.
Oh this was a double-edged coin.
Excuse me?
Can you tell me where I can find my son's cubby?
Winston!
What are you doing here?
And before you answer that question, get out of here!
Winston?
Can't you read?
You said I couldn't do it, but I did it.
I am deep undercover right now.
No one's gonna believe you're a parent here.
Jimmy-dubs!
- Where'd you go?
- I needed a refill on the java, E-dawg.
-  -  Oh, my goodness!
I see you've already met and also, already have '90s hip-hop nicknames for each other.
Genevieve, this is James Wonder.
- Hey.
- A potential new dad.
He's a landscape architect.
- Oh.
- And father of Asher.
And husband of?
I I'm a widower.
Oh, oh Yeah.
Yeah, she, um she got squished.
- Squished?
- Mm-hmm.
Did she?
Did she?
Okay, James.
Uh, let's leave now so I can show you the school's landscaping.
Wait, actually, I have a stubborn back yard.
Uh, I don't want to bring in frogs, but if I could attract frogs Very common situation in our business.
- You need a well.
- A well?
Oh.
Well, you need to let me buy you a bottle of wine - and pick your brain about all this.
-  That sounds good, E-dawg.
We should But but right now, - I should get going.
- Yeah.
I got a butt load of koi fish in the back of my truck that need bonding.
Please, let me show you out.
Take my hand.
Oh, God.
Did I say breast?
I meant I meant hand.
Uh, hey.
Hey, Ed.
I'd love to circle back around to that principal conversation.
Let me just stop you there, Miss Day.
Um, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think I speak for every parent at Banyon Canyon when I say, you're just not a good fit.
Wh-what?
I am a perfect fit.
I have my reasons.
Excuse me, I have, uh  Good-bye.
I'm making this for Genevieve.
I'm I gotta convince her to make my case to Ed.
My man, Ed.
Listen Jess, I could go ahead and give him a call if you like.
All you have to do is say the word.
No, no, no, no.
This is no country for James Wonder.
I'm not having you go undercover at school again.
No offense, but you kind of fell out of your dress when Genevieve came on to you.
I did get rattled.
I have a girlfriend, and I adore Ally.
But everything else I'm doing seems to be working because Ed loves me.
You know, he wants James to landscape his yard.
So I drew him four sketches.
Wow.
Winston, these are actually really good.
I don't remember drawing these.
I woke up this morning, and they were under my pillow.
- Hey, Nick - Would you be interested in rubble from old Yankee Stadium?
What, for my rubble collection?
I'm having a really hard time finding something for you.
I thought I was just gonna go on the Internet, but the Internet is so different now.
Have you been on the Internet lately?
- How drunk are you?
- I remember when the Internet used to just be a naked lady and a bunch of dancing hamsters.
How drunk are you, Nick?
I literally haven't had one thing to drink.
- How many drinks have you had?
- Give me a breathalyzer.
- It feels like you're drunk.
- Z-Y-X-N-L-P-A.
- You're hammered.
- I'm drunk.
Nick, whatever you get us, we're going to love.
It it doesn't matter.
I don't know what to get you, - and it matters, it matters!
- It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter!
Just get us something!
: There's a registry.
You go on it, and you pick something!
- Now you've got Schmidt all cranked up.
- You're cranked up?
Yeah, I got to go to the arcade now and blow off steam!
I didn't mean to crank you up.
- Hey, Cece.
- Hey, hey.
I don't know what to do.
I want to get you something great, but I can't find anything on the Internet.
Here's the truth.
I'd give you my heart.
I'd rip it out of my chest but but then I would literally die.
But you know that, you're studying to be a nurse.
- No, I'm not.
- You're already a nurse?
- Not a nurse.
- But you went to college didn't you?
Why didn't you just give us the Vitalstir?
Because then it would just end up in a landfill in a year when they come out with a Vitalstir 3001.
Well, I imagine they'd go to 4000.
Do you think that they have made 3,000 different Vitalstir models?
Do you really think they've perfected this blender in four tries?
You're not a nurse.
Look, I know what you're struggling with right now, okay?
You want to get us something that's unique.
It's got to be great.
It's got to be from me to you.
Alright, here's a little exercise close your eyes.
Now, first thing that comes to your mind.
Imagine something that is unique, it's permanent.
I got it!
Okay, you got to open your eyes before you go, you drunk.
Let me give you the, uh, keys so you can close up.
Oh, no.
I put two hands in at the same time again.
I did it again.
I can't find this James Wonder anywhere.
I just wanted to say hi, and I want to send him a password-protected video I thought he might enjoy.
Well, I just brought you a little gift.
I know what you're doing.
Jess, I have told you I can't afford to get involved in school politics.
Please, Genevieve.
I'm begging you.
There's no delicate way to say this so I'm going to be incredibly cruel.
They don't like you.
- At all.
- Ow.
- They despise you.
- All right.
I got it.
- "Get rid of Jess".
- Yikes.
These aren't my words, Jess.
I'm just repeating what I'm hearing.
"Jess is the worst".
- Okay.
- "Can't stand the sight of her".
- Don't need all of it.
- Do you understand what I am saying?
- Yeah.
- They've asked me to move on with my search.
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?
Would you talk me up to Ed if I could tell you where he was having dinner?
With James Wonder?
Winston.
You need to say the words, Jess.
I need your help.
I need your help, who?
I need your help, James Wonder.
Well, then, my help you shall have.
What'd he say?
Is he going to help?
Here is your mission.
You're going too down to Brickfield and you're going to facilitate a conversation about me - with Ed - My man.
- and Genevieve.
- I'm out.
Please, Winst - James Wonder.
- She wants to have sex with me.
I know you love Ally, but James Wonder is still grieving.
Lean into the character.
This is your chance to prove that you can do undercover work.
Please?
All right, I'll do it.
Under one condition.
That I - No, I don't have any conditions.
- Okay.
I design all the landscaping, and my crew my crew, they do all the dirty work.
If you were my boss I would be employee of the month every single day.
WINSTON : All right then.
Oh, jeez, Genevieve, stop flirting, get to me!
Are you shouting at a podcast again, Jess?
You know it can't hear you, right?
Shh!
Speaking of bosses, Ms. Day has done some amazing work.
- Strong disagree.
- Uh, what is your ish with her?
She sets our kids up for failure.
What?
!
This ridiculous math decathlon ugh!
It is competitive and demeaning.
It is hard enough out there for these kids.
Affluent children in Los Angeles do have it hard.
Exactly.
Samanthia bombed that dumb thing, never got a medal, and now she's lost her appetite for soosh!
That's what he's mad at?
My version of the demathlon is way less rigorous than the South Korean teacher I copied it from.
Either bring the phone over here where we can hear it, or stop talking to it.
He's saying that unless I drop the demathlon, I'll never be principal.
James.
I am trouble after two glasses.
So why don't you pour me a third?
- Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
Do it.
- Okay.
Mm-hmm.
O-okay.
- Do it.
Do it!
- Okay.
Okay.
Stop it!
Stop it!
I'm going to get crazy.
You're making me crazy.
I did it.
Best present ever.
Please.
I'm trying to eavesdrop on Winston's alter ego.
Oh -  James.
- Hmm?
- You seem troubled.
- No, I don't.
You must be holding a lot of sadness in your legs.
I have hands like a bonobo strong.
Oh, wow.
There we go.
- Ooh.
Very good.
- Aah!
Ow!
Now, no!
I have a girlfriend.
- Her name is Ally.
- No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Wasn't your wife recently squished?
Yeah.
That-that happened.
She was indeed But then, we cremated her.
And we, we, we had to dry her out first.
Ugh.
He's scrambling like a damn egg!
- I got to get in there.
- Wait, you got to see my gift!
Who are you, James Wonder?
I'm just a a combination of my two favorite singers.
I'm about to gift your brains to pieces.
You got to real pull-the-rip-cord-while- still-in-the-plane kind of vibe, Nick.
It's a little something from me to you.
- All right.
- Or, more accurately, on me.
Check it out.
I got the best gift.
It is your faces, but it's not your bodies.
- I didn't have a full body shot so - Wow!
they picked the bodies.
-  Is that Pretty Woman?
- This is from the movie Pretty Woman and it's on me forever.
Say something.
Say something.
It-it's cute, it's really cute.
I really did it.
Talk to me about how happy you are.
It's on me forever.
I know we're on you forever and ever, until you're buried in a non-Jewish cemetery.
And now we-we owe you a a thank you card.
Just don't know where I'm gonna find the words to express all of the emotions that I'm feeling right now.
I can't find anything about you online, James.
Not even the darknet.
Oh, I was gonna say, you checked the darknet, yeah?
I'm usually on there, they usually got some stuff about me.
Hey!
Oh, thank God.
Jess ica Day.
I can't believe you guys are all at my favorite restaurant.
Hey, does anyone have a red landscaping truck?
'Cause it's getting towed.
Anyone?
Red landscaping truck?
- No, mine's white.
-  Well, it could be white.
It's getting towed.
I-I did take the red one today.
Yeah, can't let that get towed.
- My crew is napping in the back.
- Yup.
Well : Hey.
- This is an unexpected treat.
- Well, I'm happy to have ran into you because, um I've been thinking, and I'm canceling the demathlon.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But I thought you loved the math decathlon?
It's a holdover from my old public school days.
It's unnecessarily competitive.
Old habits die hard.
That's true, you know, I still eat a ton of meat and I've been vegetarian for years.
Like, a ton.
A ton of meat.
I mean, I didn't realize you were so amenable.
Hey, actually, Samanthia loves puppets.
What would you say if I asked you to introduce ventriloquism into the curriculum?
And do less math?
I'd say : You got it!
Great.
"Sincerely"?
"Sincerely"?
"Dear Nick, thanks for the tattoo.
"Sincerely, S and Cece".
You guys hate my gift?
No, we don't hate it, we love it, I see it every time I blink.
You guys want to see it?
- It's okay.
- Ah, I'll show it anyhow.
Check it out.
There's an ingrown hair that gives Cece a bit of a Rudolph nose.
And when I flex my feet it makes you guys fatter.
Look.
Fat, look how fat your face looks, Schmidt.
You have the fattest face in the world.
All right, stop it!
Stop the horror!
We hate the gift.
- It's disgusting.
- It is disgusting.
You've ruined your leg.
It is like you stole our souls.
You depicted my wife as a common street whore.
Fine, you don't want it?
You can't have it.
I'll get it removed and we can go about our lives again in a week.
You know it costs, like, two grand and takes a year or something, right?
Well, I did not know that.
Okay?
I didn't know that.
Well, that really sucks for me.
But fine, then that's your present.
That's not a present.
Look Nick, I appreciate you trying to do something meaningful for us, but just give us the blender you bought.
Well, the jokes on you, I burnt out the motor making a bubble gum smoothie.
You're back on the registry then.
I won't do it!
It's a list made by robots.
Idiot!
Trying to get me something meaningful!
The only thing meaningful to me is the blender!
Remember to bring your pets to school next week for human zoo day.
Yeah.
Oh, and I'd also like to let everyone know that we are switching back from this soap to this soap, okay?
So just be aware.
Next, I would like to offer my personal endorsement of Jessica Day as our next principal.
All right, well, first, I'd love to open up the floor to questions.
Anybody?
Oh, wow, okay.
Can you get rid of the white lines in the parking lot?
- They're very restrictive.
- I think they're for MAN 2: Shouldn't we designate the green space for European-style football?
And for Tofu Tuesday, can we get a more balanced juice pairing?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I came to say goodbye.
Asher and I are moving to Colorado.
- Is that where Ally lives?
- No.
The city of Denver wants me to landscape an entire mountain.
- It's a whole thing.
- MAN 1: How about once a week in the dining hall we serve sushi omakase?
- Oh, oh, okay.
-  Guys, uh, plenty of time to run our suggestions by her.
But I assure you she will be very amenable.
She is a principal for the parents.
Hmm?
Uh, actually, um, no.
I-I have to be honest here.
I That's not who I am.
I'm not gonna be a principal for the parents.
I'm gonna be a principal for the kids.
Look, you all love your kids and they're yours to raise, but I'm an educator and I know how to educate.
Colby, your son Vince had the handwriting - of a Hungarian doctor.
- Mm-hmm.
And that's why I encouraged him to sign up for calligraphy comics after school.
He didn't want to do it, but look at him now.
I can finally read the captions for his disturbing images.
And Molly, do you remember how terrified Beatrice was of public speaking in the second grade?
That's why I bumped her up to fourth grade debate team.
Yeah, she made a toast at my brother's wedding.
I mean, besides one racist joke, she killed.
Ed, when I met Samanthia, math was her least favorite subject.
Now she's doing fractions and loving it.
And yeah, she's didn't win a demathlon medal and I know that stung, but it made her want to get better.
And isn't that what school is for?
Look, I think challenging your children prepares them for the real world.
And if given the chance, I think I can help your kids and this school reach its full potential.
And if that's not what you want, and I'm not the right fit, then I can live with that.
Genevieve, I got you something.
Something to remember me by.
Oh.
Shouldn't this be in a pot?
Oh, Genevieve.
You don't know anything.
- I'm so glad I'm doing this.
-  You know, it was weird this morning in the shower just me and tattoo you.
I was the only one who was naked You know, we could loan you the money to remove it.
I don't like debts.
All finished, guys.
Glad we all talked ourselves into thinking that this somehow makes the nightmare better.
Nick, I just want to say - I really think - I'm not getting a damn cat on my leg.
Drop it.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 So they call our names and we can't decide what song to sing.
I want to do Journey, of course.
- And Jess wants to Adele.
- Of course.
- We can't decide.
-  Hail Mary we decide to do The Doors!
And we bring the house : down.
Oh, that's the end?
- Yeah.
- Riveting.
I like the story.
You know, The Doors?
Man, that's a nice white group.
Yeah, I love that you two are dating.
Well, Cece and I have moved on to a very different and more exciting chapter.
We'd like to invite all of you to a walkthrough of our new kitchen.
- We have finally have walls.
- Got the walls!
Wait, you're just getting walls now?
Who's building your house?
Congress?
So relevant.
- To the news of today.
- Mm-hmm.
Truth be told, we've had some trouble with our contractor.
He's a real Joe Public.
Just a newspaper-and-dump kind of guy.
Robby, hey.
I haven't seen you at the marina.
Hey, Joan.
I know.
I haven't been sailing much since I broke most of my body and face.
Oh, you look good to me.
We should grab dinner.
Or breakfast.
Or both.
Uh, I don't know.
But it's really great to see you so far inland.
Great to see you, too.
Keep it moving, Joan.
Your purse don't match your bangs.
- Sorry about that, Jess.
- Why are you sorry?
: The boat lady was hit The boat lady was hitting on him.
- Right in front of you.
- So?
I don't own him.
He's not the box set of Felicity.
Question, because I'm invested.
Um, are you two exclusive?
- Oh, well, we haven't had - Well, I mean - a proper conversation about it.
- Yeah, I don't think  There's a whole This feels like a private conversation Shhhh!
Respectfully, I'd like to take it slow, you know?
'Cause I'm always diving into the deep end in relationships and I'd kind of like to splash around the shallow end.
I get it.
Let's just let this chicken marinate.
So, what are we looking at here?
Uh, open relationship?
Friends with benefits?
The old "dog and bone" situation?
We're just two people hanging out in a cool and modern way.
Welcome to the future.
What exactly is a "dog and bone" situation?
I'm assuming you-you're the bone You know damn well I was the bone!
Almost broke my neck.
I am terrified about what women have done to you, Winston.
We all got to get off, right?
- We all got to get - I'm gonna need you to leave.
I saw that coming.
- Ooh!
Officer and a Gentlemen!
- Yes.
Nice.
Um, Die Hard 2!
I truly love pre-movie trivia.
Me, too, and I love seeing the local advertisements.
I like knowing who's hot in the teeth-whitening game.
Also, Robby, I just want to say I'm really happy we're both on the same page about taking it slow.
- I feel really great about it.
- Me, too.
And, actually, I got a date this weekend.
Really?
With the boat lady?
Oh, no, it's a woman I work with at the factory, Babs.
You work in a factory?
Well, no, actually, um, I design them.
Oh, well, that's not fascinating at all.
That's fresh from the sarcasm factory, -  - 'cause it is fascinating.
Thought you would've mentioned that before.
You guys ask me surprisingly little about my personal life.
You're okay with this, right?
I mean, you wanted to see other people.
Yeah.
Yeah, I definitely said that.
Yeah, I actually have a date, too.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
- With who?
- Shh, trailers are starting.
Okay, this way.
Come on in.
Wait, so Robby has a date?
That was so fast.
The man didn't waste any time.
But you know what?
It's okay, 'cause I'm dating, too.
But you aren't, though.
Your guy's fake.
Can we come back to Robby designing factories?
The man is an enigma.
He's my second best friend, and I know nothing about him.
Now, can we please focus?
We are doing a formal walkthrough.
Behold, the kitchen of tomorrow.
Where are the dang walls?
!
Mr. Jason said one week at the latest.
No!
No!
No!
Uh, a minute alone with the boy?
- Hey, bud.
- Nick I am at my wit's end here.
Should I call the Better Business Bureau?
Better Business Bureau that's not a real thing It's a very real thing and as a man who co-owns a small business with you, I'm alarmed.
You just got to know how to talk to these people.
There's Mr. Jason over there.
See the brunette with his arms crossed?
Okay, let me take a crack at this.
And don't call men brunettes.
We've talked about this before.
- That's a nice grain.
- Great grain.
- Got to cut with the grain.
- Uh, always.
- Watch the fingers.
- It's a living.
- Get the hands dirty.
- Yeah, you know, - early bird gets the worm.
-  Clean your jeans.
Ask her what time it is, she'll tell you to build a watch, you know?
Would you look at that?
It's good, though.
It's good framing.
- Ah, it's beautiful, stuff, yeah.
- These guys are good.
You guys have done beautiful stuff.
Where does a modern girl go to make a fake guy real?
That is an insane combination of words.
It's not the Internet, a bar or a nightclub, 'cause I'm uncomfortable with all those.
You're taking a lot of options off the table.
And are you sure you're just not scared to get serious with Robby because you don't want to get hurt?
No, I'm not scared, I just don't want to start a relationship with someone I barely know.
I mean, he has a boat.
What's next, a kid?
And then I have to meet the boat and the kid at some weird sea luncheon?
Honestly, playing the field sounds really exciting to me.
You know, going to strange places with strange men.
Sign me up for that.
You know, that certainly sounds like you, Jess.
You know what, you should just start right now.
There's a lot of guys here.
You should go and talk to one.
- At a construction site?
- We support it.
Okay, I can't tell if you're mocking me but fine, I'll go have a look around.
- Fine.
- Fine.
I see what you did there.
Yeah, the quicker this plays out, the sooner she'll realize how ridiculous she's being.
Now, I'm not trying to break stones over here, but what can we do about these walls?
I can't do the walls until they do the electric, and I can't do the electric without my guy.
You got to have your guy, I get it, but what am I gonna do?
If I could I would, but I'm not Santa Claus.
What do you want me to do?
What?
Do I need to get your mother out here to do it?
'Cause I'll call your mother.
I got her in my phone.
- You're gonna call my mother?
- Yeah, I'm gonna call your mother.
- All right, you sack of crap.
-  - I'll make a call.
- Thank you.
All right.
Great!
- What the hell was that?
- Oh, he's gonna call his guy he's gonna see what he can do about the walls.
Thank goodness.
I thought it was gonna be a physical altercation.
Nah, he's a good guy, he's a good guy.
Salt of the earth.
It's more about what's unsaid, you know?
What it comes down to at the end of the day is respect.
And I have it for him and he has it for me.
Interesting.
So Mr. Jason doesn't respect me?
- Oh, God, no.
- Hmm.
I mean, Schmidt, I love you, but but you're not a man of the people.
Of course I'm not a man of the people I'm above the people.
I want the people to build things for me.
And that's where I come in.
I can't rely on your crass Chicago street smarts forever.
I'm a homeowner, and I'm a husband, and hopefully, one day I'll be a father.
If he's not gonna respect me, then I need to become someone that he will.
That sounds a little scary.
Who-who are you looking to become, Schmidt?
You.
Ugh.
Anyway, if any of you gentlemen are looking for something modern and non-exclusive You got a nail in your ass.
Oh.
Um, that's not my ass, that's actually my dress.
Could one of you guys help me?
- No, we're busy right now.
- Come on.
Oh.
Thank you Es good?
Es very good.
Mm!
So, how's Babs?
- Is she puttin' out?
-  Well, she's great.
I-I haven't gone out with her yet, but I look forward to getting to know her in a relaxed and modern way.
Great.
I'm ready to tell you about my guy now.
His name is Stavros, and he is Greek, which is exciting.
That's very exciting.
- Yeah - He sounds sounds very sexy.
I can't believe she met a man at a construction site.
- I mean, I'm kind of impressed.
- He thinks it's really funny - how big our drinks are.
- They are big.
I'm concerned Robby doesn't care.
They're testing each other.
Look at his bottom lip.
Stavros is taking me to a club on Friday.
Ah.
Yeah okay.
I get it.
He cares.
Okay, uh we were supposed to go out on Friday.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
You know what?
Should I cancel?
No.
It's okay.
I'll just go out on Friday with Babs.
Sounds fun.
It's gonna be fun.
Or crazy idea.
What if we all hang out together?
Very interesting.
Like a double date?
That seems precarious.
Oh, it's totally just gonna blow up in their faces, and they're gonna need us when it does, so we should probably be on call.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
We're a very important part of this.
What'd I tell you?
They're putting the electrical in.
Ta-da!
Don't say ta-da around these guys.
- And why are you wearing my clothes?
- I'm you.
You are making this way creepier than it needs to be.
- But let's work on your stance, okay?
- Okay.
You're gonna want to adjust your pants a lot, like watch me.
Like this.
Just like looking around, checking it out, adjust your pants; try it.
Just do it normal, just do it normal.
Don't make that face.
Regular face.
If you're gonna do anything with your shoulders, it's this.
Just relax No.
You're doing this Don't do that here.
It's like this Okay, let's try something else.
I think you-you need to slouch a little bit, 'cause all these people have back pain.
Look, I'm sorry that I have good posture.
I'm not on my hands and knees all day slapping hot tar on a roof.
I'm sitting in an ergonomic office chair like a frickin' gentleman.
So, here's a way to give a compliment.
It's you insult somebody, that's a way to show affection.
Like, hey, you ugly piece of crap, you got humongous ears.
So you're too insecure to show affection, so you do the opposite.
And if you're ever in a pinch, and the moment's getting on top of you, just mention the game.
: You got this, man.
You got this.
Hey, what's up dum-dum?
I'm sorry, I was breaking so much balls before.
I had a really stressful day at the office.
You know, the, uh, boss was really giving it to me, so I kicked his ass, but I'm better.
Hey, uh, I know how it goes, bud.
So now that we have the electrical, maybe we can get started on the walls?
Wh-what do you say, bud?
Oh, uh, we're gonna have to wait on the inspection.
And that could take a few months.
A few months?
!
Any way we could speed this process along?
- What do you say, you dirty slut?
- Slut?
Look, this a city issue.
But we could, uh, throw a little money at the situation.
See what we see.
Throw a little bit of money, see what we see.
Who do I make the check out to?
Los Angeles?
- Or ma-make it to cash.
- There you go.
Yeah.
All right.
Now we're talking.
Ow!
Caught a little bit of my ween in there.
- You all right?
- Just the tip, just the tip of the ween.
Okay.
Wow.
Your house is amazing.
Who lives here, Vin Diesel?
No.
But we do share a gardener.
This is Stavros.
He brought homemade wine.
Thank you, Stavros.
Looks, uh, very fresh.
Is that right?
Does he speak English?
No.
But his last name has 17 consonants, which I find very charming.
- Sure.
- So where's Babs?
- Putting her grandkids to bed?
-  Hey.
I'm Babs.
: This is gonna be fun.
To life!
This bottle's very warm.
So, Babs, um, you work at the factory with Robby?
I'm the head engineer.
Babs is a genius physicist.
She got her doctorate from Cambridge.
Wow.
I didn't I mean, that's very impressive.
Stavros is from a rich tradition of, uh, craftsman.
Without men like him, we wouldn't have houses to live in, or delicious wine to drink with friends.
: Salud.
- Salud.
- Yamas.
: Oh - it burns.
- Es good?
- Es good.
- Es good?
It's good.
- Is that a gold record on your wall?
-  Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
I-I played bass on a Santana album.
Who are you?
Yeah, there's there's no updates yet.
- I wonder how it's going.
- Mm, mm, mm.
Waiter has my credit card, in case we need to leave, we're ready.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Hey, let me ask you something.
You think we're too involved in Robby and Jess?
It could be argued that - this is a little unhealthy.
- Mm.
What does it really say about us, you know?
Are we just so bored with our own lives now that we're settled and in love?
Nah, that's not what's happening here, okay?
- We're not bored.
- Right.
All right.
I got a lot of stuff going on.
- Yeah.
- Whoo-ho.
- Let me start from the top.
- Okay.
- Let me tell you, last week?
- Yeah.
I had ants in my room.
Yeah.
What else, what else, what else, what else?
Ooh, I think I'm gonna try the crab breast.
- Did it.
- Sure did.
You know what's crazy?
Not only did I get Mr. Jason to respect me, but I think I learned to respect him a little bit, too.
I like the people; so wild and lazy.
If you want, I could take you to the store I get my jeans.
It's actually just a Mexican supermarket.
- Give it to me.
- I got it.
Give it to me You okay?
Give it to me.
Look at the suds.
You ruined a beer.
Ah, there he is.
Hey-o.
Working late.
So, Mr. Jason, did we get the inspection, or are we gonna keep waiting around like a couple of jamooks?
Eh, threw some sawdust on the puddle, but it's still wet.
I don't know is that a bad thing or good thing?
- Means he didn't get it.
- Hey, blame the city.
I hate the city!
Stup-stupid city.
Well, you know what, Mr. Jason?
You tried.
Thank you for that.
I guess you can just give us our money back.
Oh, I don't have your money.
We didn't get the inspection, though.
Well, I said we'd see what we see.
And this is what we saw You get it.
I don't think that I do get it.
Do we get it, Nick?
Do I, do I I don't get it.
- Do you get it?
- I get it.
Aren't those the copper pipes for our bathroom?
These are extra.
I'm gonna use them on another job.
Oh, at another job.
Oh, it and he left with them.
What does he do?
I don't understand - What's happening?
What is happening?
- Oh, I get it.
I get it.
We got ripped off.
- God I knew it.
- How did I not see this coming?
Maybe I've lost touch with the people.
Serves me right being such a damn success.
I'm sitting in my ivory tower like Dan Brown!
Nick, you're a very talented writer, but you're no Dan Brown.
You've never even had anything published.
Well, if I'm no Dan Brown, and I'm no man of the people, then who am I?
Stop having an identity crisis!
Now is not the time.
What we need to do is come up with a plan that combines both of our strengths.
- I like this.
- Here's what I'm thinking.
We invite Mr. Jason over for the game.
And while I'm hosting the hell out of him, you sneak down, and you steal those pipes out of his truck.
- Let's do this, man!
Let's do this!
- Nobody rips us off.
- Nobody rips us off!
- Let's do it!
I think what you wanted to do was more like that.
Why didn't mine break?
It's really easy to break it, you just  - Ten seconds.
- Ten seconds.
- Choiros.
Choiros chrimata!
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?
- Choiros chrimata!
What does that mean?
I think, I think he's saying "pig money".
Is it pig money?
- Time!
-  Well, it was piggy bank, which is close enough.
We gave you "garbanzos" for "chick peas".
I'm afraid we cannot allow it, Jess.
Man, we are wrecking you guys.
It's probably 'cause me and Babs have, uh, such a strong connection.
Whatever.
It's just 'cause you speak the same language.
I like to date people that I can communicate with.
Good for you.
Where's the wine?
I like it now.
I think it's making me hallucinate.
Mm-hmm.
Me, too.
You know what?
It's of good quality.
Last night I thought to back when we made good love - Oh, you're singing now?
- Listenin' to some Marvin Gaye All night long    Good loving body rocking - Knocking boots -  All night long  - All night long - Enough!
What is wrong with you, Robby?
What's wrong with me?
You're the one who wanted to see other people!
I said I wanted to take it slow.
I didn't say I want a front row seat to your date with some movie scientist.
This is a weird night.
Well, welcome to my world, Babs.
Jess, you don't know what you want.
I mean, do you like me?
Do you not like me?
Are we in a relationship?
Are we not?
Thank you, Stavros.
That'll do.
I'm gonna go.
Yeah, well I think we should all go.
Stavros, thank you for the psychedelic wine, but I would like you to leave my house now so that I can throw up.
Jess, we go disco?
Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz Nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz, nntz - Maybe our lives are boring.
- Mm-hmm.
Or are we just happy?
- Follow me on this one.
- Okay.
Would you want to be dating still?
- Hell, no.
- Thank you.
I am happy!
You know, and happy sometimes it's a little bit boring, but, you know, I have a great marriage.
- And who needs the drama?
No.
- Not me.
As of right now, I am washing my hands of all this Jess and Robby nonsense.
- I feel you.
- I'm out!
Jess just texted.
She needs us.
- I'm in!
Let's go!
- We're in!
Okay, that slime ball is on his way.
Are you wearing my jeans?
Yeah.
I'm all mixed up, and I can't get 'em off.
Well, that's 'cause they fit.
They look fantastic.
If you get 'em wet, I'm gonna flip out.
Let's do this.
Hey, hey, big game for the boys, huh?
Big games for the boys is right.
Mr. Jason, come on in.
- Ah.
Nice.
- Have a seat.
Nick, uh, want to go take care of that thing?
Oh, yeah, I got to fix the boiler.
Oh, gas or steam?
Double?
It's a, it's a double.
It sure is a double.
Mr. Jason, it's good to see you!
Thank you so much for having me over.
This is gonna be a good game.
Are you hungry?
We've got some food.
I've got sausages and brats, all the sports meats.
You know, I don't eat meat.
I'm a vegan.
You  -  -   Hey!
It's not what it looks like, Mr. Jason!
It must be hard to order as a vegan - in a restaurant.
- Oh!
What is happening?
What are we doing here?
How was the date?
Tell us everything.
Babs was a real catch, I drank too much hallucinogenic wine, um, screwed everything up with Robby, and now I'm at a Greek rave.
There's a rotisserie in the back if you're hungry.
Honey, what is this about?
Are you really that scared of getting hurt?
I'm not afraid of how it's gonna end.
I'm afraid of how it started.
Like, I've been so hesitant from the beginning.
Like, I need to be convinced.
Just, there's no love story called Hemming and Hawing.
Actually, there is.
Jose Canseco self-published it on the Internet.
It's about a lamb that marries a CEO.
Jess, I think you should be having this conversation with Robby.
Or maybe I need to be having this conversation with Robby!
- How much wine have you had to drink?
- I don't know.
It was in a soda bottle.
Look, don't stop me.
- I'm gonna go find Robby!
-  - Uh -  Hi, uh, I'm looking for a girl named Jess!
She wears glasses.
Kind of like this?
I know that's not a lot to go on, but the glasses are, like, her-her whole thing really.
- He's here, he's here!
- Robby?
!
- Hey!
- Cece!
Winston!
Hey!
I'm looking for Jess.
- Well, she's looking for you.
- Yeah, she's looking for you.
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's - Yeah, she's about to leave.
- I want to get out of this joint!
What's Greek for exit?
Jess?
!
Oh.
Hi.
- Jess!
- Robby!
I don't want to see other people.
And also, I'm eating a falafel 'cause I'm-I'm really, really drunk.
I'm really drunk, too, and I don't want to see anyone else, either.
We just got off to such a rough start.
I don't care how it started.
I just care where it goes.
- I like you.
- I like you, too!
You're stealing my pipes?
!
Unbelievable!
You are breaking my balls into oblivion!
You broke my balls first.
I got a scrotum full of whipped cream.
- Oh!
- You stole our money, man!
I told you, I tried to get the permit.
It didn't work out.
You got screwed over, but I didn't do it.
Then why did you take my pipes?
I bought 'em back to use at another job.
It's in your invoice!
I actually saved you money!
If that's true, I am so thankful.
- That's really nice of you, Mr. Jason.
- Yeah, great job.
- Thank you.
- You're really good contractor then.
Mr. Jason?
Are you are you crying?
It's not easy being a contractor.
I'm always the bad guy.
I just want to build other people's dreams.
Well, I feel like a buffoon.
You know what, Mr. Jason?
We misjudged you.
- Big time.
- And ourselves.
If we hadn't been so hung up on labels, we would've been able to see each other for who we are.
You're Mr. Jason.
Call me Jason.
What's with the Mr. Jason?
- You're a vegan.
- Get out.
You know, it takes 53 gallons of water to produce a single chicken egg?
- That's why!
- Great!
- What do you say we hug it out?
- All right.
- Oh, there you go.
- There you go.
There you go, Mr. Jason.
- I don't usually do this.
-  It's nice.
- Yeah, it's nice.
- All right.
Oh, that's a tight squeeze.
- Oh, boy.
Ooh, what a grip.
- Can't breathe You weren't actually in Santana.
You just met the band when you were delivering pizza to the studio?
Carlos found out that I played bass somehow, - and then he asked me to sit in.
- Huh.
Thus began the brief career I had as a studio session musician when I was a junior in high school.
I managed the girls JV wrestling team.
That's really cool, too.
- It was cool.
- Mm-hmm.
Anyway, tell me literally everything that's ever happened to you.
- You should just watch the PBS special.
- What?
!
-  I saved a guy's life.
-  What?
Whose life?
Do you know who Elon Musk is?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1  What a Halloween!
-  Whoa!
Whoa!
-  Yes!
Marcia Clark cleaned that party out.
I can't believe nobody got our costumes.
I know.
I'm not Shapiro.
I'm very clearly Travolta playing Shapiro.
Where-where is the Where did the Juice go?
Is he back on the freeway?
Three, two, one.
Midnight, November 1.
Merry Christmas season.
- Mm.
- Okay.
-  -   Uh, Jess, Winston has something he would like to tell you.
- Oh!
- Go ahead, Winston.
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah, from We did rock-paper-scissors.
Okay.
Well, you know, well, we were all thinking, and we were all on the same page.
We were thinking that maybe we don't do Christmas this year.
You know, that would be a great seminar topic in a school for demons!
- Backup.
I need backup.
Your turn.
- Well, Jess, Christmas is just so stressful with the lists and the lines and-and the dancing girls at TV Town Song Room.
TV Town Song Room?
- Do you mean Radio City Music Hall?
- Yeah.
How could you get so many things wrong in a row?
At Radio City Music's Hall.
What is going on here?
Christmas isn't stressful.
- Babe.
- Babe.
You get more stressed out by Christmas than anyone I know.
The spirit of Christmas.
Son of a whore!
- Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-  In my defense, I hadn't slept for six days.
But I do see your point.
- Okay.
Great.
- Hmm.
So it's official.
Christmas is canceled.
No, Christmas is not canceled.
Christmas gifts are how you show the people you love that you care in a very special, magical and highly mandatory way.
You want me to shop until I drop, and I don't want to drop.
How about this?
One special gift, one person, and a guessing game at the end.
Secret Santa!
- One moment, please.
-   It's the perfect compromise.
Come on.
- General agreement.
-  General agreement.
- Sure.
- We can do it.
Yes!
It's a deal.
Okay.
-  Whoa.
- Oh.
It's just me.
I'm feeling really good.
Merry Christmas Eve Eve, everybody!
Secret Santa starts tonight at 6:00 P.M., AKA 7:00 P.M. eve.
- Snacks will be potluck.
- I call baba ghanoush.
It brings back such good memories.
My dad waking me up with hot cocoa, my dog Frank dressed up as Rudolph, looking out the window, watching for snow, dancing around the Christmas tree to the sweet sounds of Darlene Love's "Christmas ".
Darlene what now?
The snow's coming down Love me some Darlene.
I'm watching it fall What am I watching now?
Two kilos of uncut joy.
Little reminder uh, tonight is for Secret Santa gifts only.
So, married people, please exchange your gifts at another time.
Oh, don't worry.
Schmidt and I aren't getting each other gifts this year.
- Uh-uh.
- Is that 'cause of the Jew thing?
Jew thing?
That's just a phrase that falls out of your mouth these days.
Oh, sorry.
I-I took the last Jew thing.
This will be the only gift that Cece is getting this Christmas, so whoever has her, please step it up.
Right, and the same goes for my man.
Just because he doesn't believe in the Lord, doesn't mean he can't have cake at the birthday party.
So, whoever has him better bring it because I know I got the perfect gift for  Up-bup-bup-bup!
Secret Santa.
Also, to that point, we're all in danger of revealing ourselves through little clues such as cave man wrapping skills.
I got mozzarella sticks for fingers.
You're making this very stressful, Jess.
No, it's not, because we have a Secret Santa helper, - and his name is -  - Robby!
- Whoa!
- Oh.
- Oh.
How long you been out there, man?
Eh, long enough to make it weird.
But I could hear everything, though, so - Sorry about the wait.
- Oh, it's okay.
- I slept in a little bit.
-  Robby is going to wrap and label all of your gifts to ensure anonymity.
I'm just gonna go wait in Jess' room.
I look forward to working with you all.
Oh, I got to get back to work.
I told the entire staff they can have three days off 'cause Christmas is usually dead at the bar.
So, it's just gonna be me and the receipts.
You haven't done those yet?
Nick, our accountant needs them today.
I know.
It's the do date, So, I'm going to do them today.
D-U-E, Nicholas.
D-O-I-N-G-I-N-G.
Doing.
The doing date.
And if you think about it, D-O-I-N-G shouldn't be doing.
It should be freaking "doyng".
Nick, you got 'em?
!
You look like you should be paying child support in Florida.
I get Nick the perfect gift, and then he goes and buys it for himself.
What am I supposed to get him now?
You could get Nick some tap shoes, right?
- They do make walking fun.
-  I told you that about tap shoes, you tree.
Now think, Jessica.
You're the greatest gift-giver of all time.
I've got it.
Whatever it is, I got it covered.
Oh, no, Robby.
What I'm giving him cannot be wrapped.
Is it a memory?
- No.
- Ah.
- A house?
- No.
Damn it, man.
False alarm.
I thought that was the mailman with my Secret Santa gift.
Yes, I know, Winston.
You've run in here at least six times.
You know, now you can just track the package.
- I can?
- Yes.
Let's see.
KXHD136.
You memorized the package tracking number, but you didn't know that you could use that number to track the package?
What?
!
9:18 A.M. refused delivery?
Did you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?
Listen to what you just asked.
Of course I did.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it, Schmidt!
I am Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo!
It is my secret Santa alias.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
Damn it!
I don't have a gift for tonight now.
Well, this is not my problem, Winston.
Oh, no, it is your problem.
Oh, you had me?
I did not have Jess, I did not have Nick, I do not have you.
It's fairly obvious who I do have.
I figured it out.
You have Cece.
- Oh.
- My Cece.
My Cece can't go gift-less.
I like to think of her as our Cece.
You screwed the pooch on this one, Winston.
Me?
I didn't screw the pooch.
- Yes, you did.
- You didn't sign for it!
How was I supposed to sign for Garage-A-Roo's package?
You and your dang old aliases.
You have a new alias every day, Winston.
- Yes, but you should know it's me!
- Garage-A-Roo, Kenneth.
But it was me clearly!
Kenneth, Kenneth.
Rick Smits, Big Poppy Jones.
These are the dumbest names I've ever heard!
- Pontius Pilate.
- AKA idiot.
Maybe that truck is still in the neighborhood.
- Let's go out and try and get it.
- Wait!
This just became a Schmidt and a Jay Garage-A-Roo mess-around.
- Freakin' Jay Garage-A-Roo.
-  So I fly you down.
You are my gift to Nick.
What do you say?
I don't know, Jess.
I mean, I have a really big pitch tomorrow.
It's a treatment for I mean, the polite term is "gravelly bowel syndrome".
So fly down for one night.
What could be more romantic or magical?
I will orchestrate the whole surprise.
Lighting, blocking, - costumes - Okay, you know what?
- I I'm in.
- You are?
I thought I was gonna have to give you the hard sell.
That's part of the reason why I'm in.
But also, I haven't seen Nick in a couple weeks, and I really miss his nonsense.
And that ass am I right?
- She's in!
-  Whoo!
Pope Francis, we have a miracle worker.
-  - The only thing left to do is Hey, Nick.
I, um, just am doing a little laundry.
I got just enough room for your bedsheets.
May I do the honors?
But don't touch them they're exactly how I like them.
But I'm really glad you called.
The bar is an absolute zoo.
I haven't even gotten to the receipts yet.
Wait-wait, what?
The point is, I'm swamped, and I'm not gonna make it for Secret Santa.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I'm just not gonna make it.
Jess, Nick is still gonna enjoy seeing Reagan, even if it means she's just gonna hang out with him at the bar.
- Yeah, it's the thought that counts.
- Yeah.
If you're in the lump of coal business!
I have to go help Nick so he can be here for the surprise.
Did you get No, you don't have a drink.
- You got hot chocolate?
- What do you want, a beer?
I'll get you in a second there, buddy.
Weirdly, this is not the first time Nick has failed to mention elves in a crisis situation.
This is way worse than you said.
I'm out of here it's my day off, and you know what, actually, I don't need more than that.
Wait, wait, no.
Cece, I need your help.
I need your help.
We have to get Nick home for Secret Santa.
Ooh, you have him.
Yes, I got Nick.
I got Nick.
Reagan's flying out from Seattle.
Oh And we're double-teaming him.
Okay, listen to me very carefully, okay?
You mean "tag-teaming".
This is the exact same thing that happened when you handed that checkout guy coupons, and said that we'd been scissoring all day.
Oh.
He helped us with our bags.
He was such a gentleman.
No, he was not.
Hey, what are you two doing here?
What are all these elves doing here?
They just got off a shift at the mall.
You know, I've been thinking, since they're all regular size, my theory is it's a mall for giants.
Let us help.
We'll man the bar.
You can hit the receipts.
Ah, it'll be fine.
Someone just has to give my Secret Santa gift.
It's for No!
Sorry.
Look, I know you don't love Secret Santa, but don't be alone on Christmas Eve Eve.
Be with the people you love.
All right, you're right.
I'll take the help.
Uh, time for the receipts, I guess.
Let me go grab my calculator.
We have a lot of work to do.
One, two, three, four - Whoa!
Whoa.
- Excuse me, uh, Deb, we need to check your trunk we're looking for a package.
It is addressed to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo.
What a stupid name.
Tell it to your stupid wife, man it's one of our inside jokes.
You two don't have inside jokes.
Man, we got loads of inside jokes!
My turtleneck, uh, my trick hip, that "Hok-fooey, Jean Luc"!
Get off my truck.
Please, it is Christmas Eve Eve.
- That's right.
- Yes.
That's my night.
So go home, and wait for your package.
All right, fine.
Okay, whatever.
You know what, Deb, that's where you're wrong.
There was a time when we didn't need people like you.
There was a time where a man could go into a place, buy a thing and leave with that thing.
And you weren't involved at all.
You lost me, Schmidt.
What are you talking about?
- Stores, Winston!
- Oh, stores!
- I remember those.
- Stores?
What are you gonna do?
Pay sales tax?
Park?
- Stores!
- Oh!
- Brick and mortar, baby!
-  I know that she loves me, so why won't she touch me?
Larry, you've got to go home, okay?
Why isn't Nick gone?
It's been four hours.
Reagan's on a plane, Secret Santa's in an hour, I'm freaking out Well, you can call me Ice Cube.
Because I'm done wrapping.
That is how you won me over.
Look, the missing piece of the puzzle is Nick.
I'm gonna go check in.
One hour till Secret Santa!
Great.
You ever done any Santa work at the Chatsworth Penney's?
- Larry?
- Robby!
Come in.
A little North Pole knock-knock.
- I finished.
- Oh.
Thank you, Jess.
And thank you for what you said about being with the people you care about on Christmas.
Oh, you're welcome.
I-I meant it.
And that is why I bought a ticket to go to Seattle to be with Reagan tonight.
Oh Fa La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la.
All right.
How do I surprise Reagan.
Here's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking I go dressed as a fireman, I knock on the door, I reveal myself to be a stripper, and then I reveal myself to be Nick.
How does that even uh Are you sure you want to go to Seattle?
I mean, it's Seattle.
Ew.
I mean, it was it was basically your idea, right?
Why don't we just get you home to I got no time.
I'm on a no-fly list, so I need to leave right now.
Checking in is very difficult.
Why not just take that name literally, and you no fly?
- Off to Seattle.
- Wait, Nick!
No!
No!
I can't let you go!
Your hair looks so stupid!
- What?
- You look like a total dork.
My hair looks stupid, I look like a total dork?
We can't let TSA see you like this.
But I've had this haircut for a little bit now.
- I know.
- You let me go to work, though?
It just looks particularly bad right this minute.
Then I'll just go like this.
- How about now?
- No.
Mm-mm.
Didn't fix it.
I get the impression you don't want me to go to Seattle.
That's because I don't want you to go to Seattle.
- Well, why not?
- I can't tell you.
I mean, I-is this about Reagan?
Do you not like her?
No, I like Reagan she looks like the front of a ship come alive.
Heh.
Is that why you've been acting so weird?
I haven't been acting weird.
You've been weird since the day I got back from New Orleans.
You're acting really squirrelly.
You don't think I've noticed, but I've noticed.
Okay, you're way off base.
I mean, what is it?
I took your advice I'm gonna be with somebody who I find really special on Christmas.
- Nick - But, surprise, I've still done something wrong.
Don't go to Seattle.
Trust me.
Why is nothing I do ever good enough for you?
What do you want from me?
I'm doing everything I can here!
Nick, I'm flying Reagan out from Seattle to surprise you.
I'm your Secret Santa, you jerk.
So this is what it feels like to be instantly sorry.
Where is everyone?
- I thought this place would be crazy.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Yeah, those were the days.
Now people prefer to shop online.
My grandfather opened this store.
Now it closes with me.
So, to answer your question, yes, I do drink.
Um hey, we're looking for a beanbag chair.
Hey!
We have one.
Nice!
Heck, I'll go get it for you.
I'm not doing anything.
Great, great.
Brick and mortar, baby.
- A beanbag chair, Winston?
- Yeah.
You thought that would be a a suitable gift for my bride?
You wouldn't get it.
I mean, it's a reference to a classic Winston-Cece mess-around.
Beanbag chair!
Never in my life have I heard of a game of one-on-one Pictionary.
- We had a moment.
- Unmoved.
- Okay.
- Had you drawn a picture poo-poo, would that have been a good gift for my Cece?
: It would have been hilarious.
Look, Schmidt, I get it that you are closer to her than I am.
- Uh-huh.
- However, I got my own thing going on with her.
And I feel like you don't respect that.
- Closer to her?
- You are.
That's a good way to describe our relationship, - comparatively to yours.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, considering we are man and wife.
Yeah.
Winston, this is a very cozy,  inoffensive blanket.
Get it.
Has no relevance towards our relationship.
- Why would I do that?
- Get the blanket.
- No.
- Winston, please.
Just get the blanket and let's go.
Well, since you asked nicely, no.
- Just get the blanket.
- No.
I don't want the damn blanket.
Here's the beanbag chair.
Yeah, stores are the best.
Hey, you guys want to go get lunch or something?
Nah.
How much is it?
It's $249.99.
- What?
For a beanbag chair?
- For a beanbag chair?
Well, we have a cheaper one we're just, we're out of stock.
I could order it for you, but it would take seven to ten days.
Man, stores are the worst.
The admiral will take this.
Whatever happened to Hanukkah?
Hey, Jess, about that the-the stuff I s Oh, wait, it's fine I I must have seemed so crazy.
Let's just enjoy the holiday, okay?
Okay, Secret Santa.
By now, the suspense must be killing you.
As you all know, uh, Nick knows his Secret Santa gift is Reagan flying out from Seattle to surprise him.
All right.
Merry Christmas, Nick.
All right, Cece.
That big boy's for you.
What in the hell is that?
Winston, what'd you do with the thing we just bought?
Beanbag chair!
Beanbag chair!
It's from Winston!
They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.
Winston, you remembered our game night.
I love it.
You do?
- She does.
- I do.
Well, you know what, Winston?
You were right it's the perfect gift.
I guess I just have to come to terms with the fact that my wife is a little bit weirder than I thought she was.
It's a prototype, you know?
The real one's on its way.
Didn't have a lot of beans, so I had to pad it with rice and oatmeal.
- It's a great gift.
Thank you.
- It's perfect!
Good job.
All right, well, whoever got Schmidt better have brought it, 'cause Winston set the bar really high.
Oh, here we go, here we go.
- Here we go.
Ooh - Ooh - Cashmere socks!
Dayanu!
-  Well, it's not Winston, it's not Jess.
- Cece?
- No.
No, it's not me.
- I got you, boy.
- No way.
- I got you.
This is me.
- This is you?
- Nicholas!
- Yeah, come on.
I don't know why I'm finding the image of you mispronouncing the word "cashmere" in a store to be so joyful.
"Cadsh-mer".
- Winston.
- Oh.
Ha-ha!
I get one?
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.
Everybody gets one.
That's crazy.
I get one, too.
- You know.
- Yeah, everybody does.
Aah!
For me?
Oh, my stars!
A check made out to my phone company?
Cece, girl, is this for that night we got bombed and called Iceland?
You know it is!
Okay, hold on, wait a minute, I had I had Winston, too.
Somebody got left out.
Who didn't get one?
Oh, Winnie got two gifts?
- That's for Winston.
- Yeah.
Oh no, no, it's it's fine.
It's it's my fault.
I must have gotten so tipsy on Halloween, I forgot to write down my own name.
See?
It's right there in the song.
He makes a list, he checks it twice.
See, this is probably why Santa stopped drinking.
Well, here, you know what?
Have this one.
Oh, my God, a hamster?
!
You're a pet guy, man.
I am.
I am.
But Jess, you you should have him.
No.
I-I got the best gift of all.
Watching you guys give each other gifts that show you care.
Well, you can't not have a gift.
Besides, Ferguson's gonna eat him, anyway.
Oh.
Well, if if Ferguson will eat him, then I I'll take him.
- Thanks, Winston.
- Of course.
Great Secret Santa, everyone.
You want to go to bed, little guy?
You want to see your new room?
I feel horrible.
You have no idea.
She and I got in a thing.
I said something so stupid.
-  - Sleigh!
Hey, Reagan.
- Hey.
- Really?
Do you know how hard it was to put this thing on in an airplane bathroom?
Do I. If you don't get off that wheel right now, there's gonna be hell to pay.
Now!
Whoa.
Did you understand me?
Oh, you're awa you're awake.
Great.
Nick, how often do you sneak into my room in the middle of the night?
Uh, that you're awake, uh, this is a first.
- Here.
- Weird.
Here's some cocoa.
Hey, I wanted to say that I'm sorry about what I said.
I know you are.
Thanks.
I also want to say thank you.
Even though I knew Reagan was coming, when I saw her I felt like it was Christmas morning and I was ten.
But a ten-year-old about to have sex with Santa!
And it was yeah, this is getting weird.
Anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry and thank you.
Come with me.
Uh, actually, do you want to put a bra on first?
-  Cue the music.
- - Surprise!
-  Merry Christmas, Jess.
-  We got something for you.
- Ta-da!
Robby set it all up.
JESS : What?
!
This is for you.
Christmas The snow's coming down -  - Christmas I'm watching it fall - Christmas -  Lots of people around Christmas Baby, please come home What is Darlene Love doing here?
Uh, we used to do hot yoga together.
Oh.
All ringing in song Christmas What a happy sound This is amazing!
Baby, please come home They're singing "Deck the Halls" But it's not like Christmas at all 'Cause I remember when you How much longer do I have to do this?
I'm almost out of litter.
- It's shredded receipts.
-  Christmas This is the best gift.
- Thank you.
-  Merry Christmas, Jess.
Bar elves!
Come on in!
Baby, please come home
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Game time, folks.
Hands up, pants up.
Reagan is moving in today and I don't want her thinking that we're making a big fuss about it.
Hey, Schmidty, what are you doing, bud?
I'm opening up a subtle Montepulciano.
It's a welcoming wine.
Put out nothing!
Be cool.
-  - Winston, when she gets here, act casually.
Pretend like you didn't even know she was coming.
: As I live and breathe, Raisin?
!
- Ah, did I say, "Raisin"?
- Yeah.
Too weird.
Go practice in your room.
- I'm very mad at you.
Go.
- What is happening?
- It needs to look messier.
- Hi.
- It needs to look messy.
- You are having a straight up anxiety attack right now.
Nick, Nick, calm down.
You guys lived together in New Orleans.
If the old girl didn't like the dinner, she wouldn't come back for seconds.
New Orleans was temporary.
Okay?
Reagan has never stayed in one place too long.
If she thinks we're making a big deal, she's gonna feel smothered.
Okay?
So you've got to do the opposite.
It's not a big deal.
That's why I didn't pick her up from the airport.
You didn't pick her up from the airport?
Didn't this woman change her whole job so she can move here to be with you?
She is gonna be pissed.
Uh, no.
No.
: Yes, she is.
No, you're wrong.
She's gonna be relieved.
Pissed.
No, she isn't.
You're wrong.
- Reagan hates, - No.
hates this kind of stuff.
In New Orleans, once while she was sleeping, I tried to cover her with a blanket to be sweet and she basically choked me out.
I understand that.
- What's in the bag, Jess?
-  These are old lady caramels, just a little thing that Reagan and I have.
You and Reagan have things?
I didn't even know you guys were in touch.
Yeah, we text.
You know.
We also send each other pictures of bears wearing backpacks and other humorous exchanges.
- What?
- How about we all relax, with a nice cheese plate?
Look at that halloumi.
- Love halloumi.
- What?
No, no, no, no no, no, no.
Too late.
You're banned.
Go to Winston's room right now.
- Reagan!
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Oh, Reagan, it's good to see you.
- You made it.
- Hey.
- Uh, two duffel bags, that's all?
- Yeah, well, I travel light which is lucky for me, because the only way I could get here from the airport was to split a cab with a lady who was eating a sub from the middle.
Ha-ha!
: Caramel?
Well, I can't eat these yet 'cause I don't have my teeth in.
JESS : It reminds me of a cardboard tea set I had during the war.
What am I looking at?
We had to save all the metal for the boys.
-  - Well, look who it is.
Raisin.
I said, "Raisin" again, didn't I?
Hey, Jess.
How are you doing with everything?
You know, Nick, Reagan, living across the hall.
Totally fine.
I didn't hear a thing.
I took every precaution.
NICK : Oh, Reagan.
-  -  NICK : Okay, now.
That was a good call.
They sounded like two Germans - having a sponge fight.
- Aah, aah That's how I was.
It was disgusting.
- Gross.
- How are you doing otherwise?
I mean, sure, my feelings for Nick are complicated, but I have a boyfriend.
He has a girlfriend, who I have mad inside jokes with.
Everything's gonna be fine as long as I stay out of their stuff.
Hmm.
It's a little weird he didn't pick her up from the airport, though, right?
That's an example of the stuff that I'd like to stay out of.
Hmm.
Oh.
- You've been practicing.
- Ow.
-  - Yes.
Hello, normals.
- Hey.
- I just got back from the chair district where I found the perfect sitting piece for our home.
It's an original Haberman.
Hmm.
It's a Haberman.
- It's a Haberman.
- It's not helping you to repeat it over and over again.
A print ad for it features a quote from David Strathairn.
- : Str - What do you got to say now?
-  - Ugh.
Well, there goes the jukebox.
It's been on the fritz for weeks.
- I know.
- Whoa.
Hold on, now.
It might have some life left in it, thanks to Dr. The Fonz.
Heyyy  Check me out.
- What the hell?
- Winston!
Ooh!
That's the least Fonzie move ever.
It was borderline Chachi.
I just wanted to be Art Fonzarelli for a day.
- Ugh.
- You know?
Black dude playing a Jewish dude, playing an Italian dude and the world goes 'round.
I think I have some speakers behind the bar.
I'll just hook up my phone.
Wait, wait, wait.
Time out, time out, time out.
I know I just did something really stupid, but why do you automatically get to be in charge of the music?
'Cause I have the best taste.
Oh, no, no, babe.
All you like is electronica.
It's EDM, electronic dance music - Yeah, here we go.
- or what I like to refer to it as, as just "M" - because it's the only music.
- Music.
Yeah, listen, Schmidt, it's trash.
Need I remind you that you started a petition to get Enya to play at the Super Bowl halftime show?
You're misrepresenting my petition.
Okay?
I wanted her to play on the field during the fourth quarter.
Schmidt, I bet I could make a fake EDM song and you couldn't tell it apart from a real one.
'Cause they all sound like a robot having a seizure.
Noice.
Not loving this dynamic.
- We don't care.
- We'll test it out.
Cece and I will make a song.
- Ooh.
- And if we fool you, we're in charge of the music in the bar, All Enya, all up in ya.
- I'm in.
- Great.
Have fun looking like idiots, you morons.
I don't really have any place to go.
I mean, I came here to hang out with you guys, so Hey, you two lovebirds.
It's your first day of living together.
So, what are you doing tonight?
I can't do anything tonight.
I picked up an extra shift at the bar.
No big deal, right?
Yeah.
It's totally fine.
Everything's totally fine and we are good.
Okay, well how about you?
You want to go out and maybe have like a little ladies' night?
I just feel like getting really dumb.
Yeah.
Dude, I'm the dumbest.
It's a date.
I am gonna take a seven-minute power nap and then go for a run to preempt all of this damage we're gonna do.
I love it, I love it, I love it.
: Sounds good.
How'd I do?
I'm sorry.
What?
With the whole I got to go to work and cover some shifts.
I don't have to go to work.
I don't have work tonight.
I'm actually gonna go to a bowling alley and, uh, get some beers and watch people bowl.
You lied to Reagan, so you can watch strangers bowl?
Yeah, definitely.
I'm trying to play it cool.
I don't want to seem needy.
Are you sure you want to start this thing off with Reagan by playing a game?
You know what?
Actually I don't want to get involved.
Do whatever you want.
Just don't tell me about it 'cause Jess is out.
I put a Lego in my shoe to really push myself.
- That sounds painful.
-  Cool, cool, cool.
Have a lot of fun tonight.
Have fun.
Okay?
- Fun at ladies' night.
- Thanks.
Ladies night!
You're such a lightweight.
I feel fine.
Hell of a ladies' night, though.
A lot of secrets came out last night, didn't they?
Secrets?
Cece!
I think I really screwed up ladies' night.
I know I reek.
-  - Please, please, don't gag because then I will gag.
Okay, okay, it's really hard though, man.
I think something terrible happened.
Reagan said, "A lot of secrets came out last night".
Uh-oh, you think she knows about Nick?
I mean, I only have one secret, so - it's got to be the Nick thing.
- It's the Nick thing.
This is bad.
Really bad.
Yeah, it's not good.
Ah, how could I let this happen?
-  -  I'm sorry, I was holding my breath the whole time.
-  -    -  -  Oh, my God.
You need to calm down.
All right, just take a breath.
Think of Michelle Obama.
: She's so strong.
See, it's working already.
Besides, you don't even know what you told Reagan.
I know she said that we have a secret between us.
You don't just say that.
Okay, all right.
Tell me what you remember.
Let's just piece together what happened.
Just the two of you?
Oh, look.
This bar has hooks for our purses.
Score.
Thank you.
Skip to the next track.
Splash, bitch, splash!
I'm gonna splash you in your dumb wet face.
I really need to wash my hands.
- New friend!
- New friend!
Is this leading to the secret?
I don't know, Cece.
My brain is a smoking wreckage and I'm trying to find the black box.
Okay, let's try to jump-start it.
Okay?
Let me try something.
Secret!
Secret!
- Secret!
- What are you doing?
- Secret!
- This is not gonna work.
- Secret!
- It was something about a pool.
Oh, my God, Cece.
You're amazing.
You should work for the CIA.
I know.
Stay focused on the pool.
I hate the way that tastes.
- Idea.
- What?
Let's go to the pool.
Is "pool" cocaine?
I mean, is "the pool," like, a drug thing?
'Cause I don't "swim".
Like, I-I don't judge people who do "swim," but I don't.
No, it's a real pool.
An actual pool at my apartment, my other apartment.
: I have another apartment.
- No, no - It's a secret.
Don't tell Nick, don't tell Nick.
- No.
- Shh.
- Oh, no.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh Okay, well, it's time to do future Jess a solid and black the hell out.
Reagan has a secret apartment.
A secret apartment?
Past Jess was trying to keep me out of this.
What is she, a D.C. madam?
I have to make sure Nick never finds out about this.
You know what?
I'm gonna stay out of it.
- Hmm.
- Classic Jess, staying all the way out of it.
When we are done with this song, Schmidt will totally think it is by Diplo or Garrix - or Deadmau5.
- What is this?
Don't worry about that, your mind is in a weird situation.
First things first.
I recorded a bunch of noises around the loft.
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.
So we could use it as the hook.
It is the mark of any EDM song.
- Okay.
- Now, check this one out.
Nick shaving without shaving cream.
- He's bleeding at this point.
- It's good, I'm just laughing at - Yeah, it's nasty.
- just seeing him.
Okay, check this one out.
Haberman, my Haberman.
Haberman.
My Haberman.
My-my-my-my Haberman.
This one has a pretty good rhythm to it.
All right, this one right here is about to set the city up topsy-turvy.
- All right.
- Ferguson going to town on Jess's bunny slippers.
It's not nothing.
- Ferguson, you nasty.
- Did you hit the button?
You see, he's a gentle lover.
You understand?
That's why you can't really hear anything, but you can feel what the slipper is feeling.
- There's no sound.
- No, you got to - He's a - I can't hear anything.
- he's a gentle lover.
- There's no sound in there!
- He's a gentle lover!
- You're just there with the phone - and there's no sound.
- Hello.
You don't understand.
Oh, hey.
Yeah, it's not so easy, is it?
Can't just snap your fingers and become a couple of Calvin Harrises-e-es.
Listen, this is all part of our process, okay?
- So beat it.
- Yeah.
Shoo.
We got a song to write that's gonna give you the best damn aural you have ever had.
Check yourself.
Oh, A-U-R-A-L.
- Mmm.
-  For your ears.
- Yeah.
- Noice.
Well, I will see you on game day, suckas.
Ow.
You're not very scary.
We cannot let him get away with that, okay?
We need to dig deep, Winston.
Do I look scared?
Watch this.
Oh, that's just Nick eating a microwave burrito.
No, that actually almost works.
- Really?
- Yeah.
-  Haberman.
-  It was something about a pool.
Haberman.
My-my-my What the hell is that?
Hmm?
Oh, I recorded some candid audio.
- Yeah, I need this track to be real.
-  JESS : Reagan has a secret apartment.
A secret apartment?
-  -  Haberman.
-  Reagan has a secret apartment.
-  A secret apartment?
Wait, what?
Thank you.
It's missing a "what".
What?
!
Reagan has a secret apartment?
You feeling it, huh?
-  What?
!
-  -  Haberman.
My-my-my - Oh, oh.
-  - That's very bad.
I'm sorry, man.
JESS : Reagan has a secret apartment.
What?
!
: This track is right, though.
-  Reagan has a secret apartment.
-  A secret apartment?
-  Haberman.
-  What?
!
I can't believe my girlfriend has a secret apartment!
I'm sure there's some explanation.
I can think of one of two things.
One, she's worried she's making a mistake by living with me.
Or two, and this one is way more realistic, she has a secret family.
Only men have secret families.
Look, just go talk to Reagan.
I can't just run into the bathroom shouting, "You have a secret apartment," Jess.
She'll bolt to her secret apartment!
You talk to her.
Find out what the deal is.
No way I'm getting involved.
You leaked the intel to Cece.
You're deeper than any of us.
I was secretly recorded.
That is a felony, by the way.
This is between you and Reagan.
Jess, you've got to talk to her.
You've got to deal with this.
She trusts you.
Please, you've got to help.
Hey Ray Ray.
- Boo Boo?
- Is this about the apartment?
- Damn.
- Jess, I know I put you in a weird spot by telling you about it.
Whatever the explanation, it's okay.
I don't need to know anything except, like, when did you get it, is it, like, a real, genuine place, or is it, like, a playing it cool thing, like Nick's fake bar shift?
- What?
- What?
You said "fake bar shift," so does that mean that he didn't have to go to work, - and that he lied to me?
- Oh my God, you know who should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.
- No.
No.
- Nick!
- I don't want to talk to him - Hey, Nick!
Nick!
- .
about anything.
- Oh, weird.
I had no idea you were having a conversation : with Reagan right now.
We are in the middle of a conversation that we need to finish, so maybe we'll do that over drinks.
Did you have other plans?
Maybe you wanted to have a conversation with somebody.
Well, I'd love to finish our conversation, Jess, so maybe you and I should get a drink.
You know what?
After last night, the only drink I can handle is room temperature milk.
- You guys got crazy?
- Don't worry about it.
- I just really would want to be able - I would love to  finish our conversation.
We started ours first, so we should finish ours earlier.
- It's basic time science.
- It's time science?
Yeah, it's time science.
You told me that you don't believe in watches or clocks, so I don't really think - this is a very valid argument.
- No, I said I believe in watches, I just don't trust who sets them.
- Who sets the time?
- You set the time.
Why would I set the time?
It's my watch.
Okay, see?
Talking is fun.
Why don't you guys continue this conversation at the bar by yourselves, without me?
I'll have a milk.
So in front of you, you have two songs, one by a recognized EDM "artist," quotes intended, the other is by me.
-  I also helped.
- : Yeah, okay.
I did!
- Lay it on me.
- Here we go.
Stop.
- What?
- What?
You're barely seconds in.
Throbbing bass, the lone whistle, the gritty caw of gears grinding.
This is clearly the work of Tim Bergling, better known as Swedish EDM demigod - Avicii.
-  Avicii - As you were.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Mm.
- Boo-yah.
It sucks to be so damn right.
Boo-yah!
- Yeah!
- Oh, oh, oh!
Those ears heard a Bishop/Parikh original track.
- This must be a shenanigan.
-  No.
- EDM is a shenanigan.
- Correct.
My-my-my Haberman.
- Ha!
- Ooh!
Yeah.
- So now, it's gonna be all Enya - All Enya.
all the time.
-  All the damn time, all day.
- Mm!
- Amenya!
- Enya.
How could I have been so wrong?
Have I always had bad taste?
Just like I said.
- Yeah, I said it, too.
- Ha.
Okay, whatever.
- I did!
- Yeah, sure.
Nobody heard ya.
If I don't have my taste, then what's real?
Are cargo shorts gorgeous?
Was I wrong about rubber awareness bracelets?
Should I grow a goatee?
Look, Schmidt, you got fooled.
- Who cares, man?
-  I care, Winston.
I care.
I always thought of myself as a brand, as a lifestyle, but now you know what, I'm gonna take back that chair, and I'm gonna get rid of all my gingham and I'm gonna go buy a 14-pack of tube socks at the grocery store.
We might have taken this one a little too far.
You took it too far.
Oh, now I'm involved.
Do you know what I think is really great?
That Nick made time for us, with his very busy work schedule.
You know what'd be fun?
If we were all just direct.
Just, you know, for laughs.
I think it's really great that we all, you know, are just kind of acting and living like one big family.
One big, happy, non-secret fam I am too hungover to deal with this, so I'm just gonna say it.
Nick, Reagan knows that you lied about having to work.
Reagan, Nick knows about your secret apartment.
- Jess!
- You told her, Jess?
I'm sorry, but now it's all out there, so you can talk about it.
I can't believe you told her.
Let's talk about how mature it is for you to pretend to not care that I switched my job and moved across the country for you.
You came from Seattle, pal.
That's down.
- Are you a cartographer now?
- Am I a cartographer?
Yeah, did you get your Bachelor's in map science?
That's what a map scientist is?
- A cartographer?
- Yes.
Why is everything a code with you?
Just say map scientist.
Guys!
Let's just try being sweet to each other.
Oh, should we be sweet like a friend that spills the other friend's secrets?
- That's a good point.
- Don't act like you didn't lie.
Your lie was bigger.
My lie didn't require a credit check.
Congratulations, Reagan.
You have more apartments than I have jeans.
So thank God I have that apartment.
'Cause guess where I'm sleeping tonight.
- Where?
- In  Well, I'll be in the honest apartment!
You said that a full two seconds after the door shut.
All right, but I still said it.
This is definitely one of those creepy apartment complexes for divorced dads and child actors.
- : Reagan!
- What are we doing here?
I thought your whole thing was not getting involved.
All I want is to not be involved, but you and Reagan are acting like complete idiots, and for friend reasons and just basic human decency, I can't walk away.
- Reagan!
-  Quiet, please.
I'm trying to enjoy my supermarket salad.
Why are you guys here?
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- You you 'cuing?
- I grill.
- It calms me down.
- That's cool.
Okay, you guys need to start being honest, and I can't help, because this whole thing the three of us living together is awkward enough without me being in the middle.
All right?
So, work it out now.
Get in here.
The code is, uh 1234#.
That's not the code.
- It's 1234#.
-  It doesn't work.
It's #1234, guy.
- Oh.
- Yeah, that works.
- Thanks, man.
-  Yep.
See myself out.
I got to say, a lot of international people living here, it's there's good and bad in that, huh?
I feel like we should probably revisit that.
What about your thing, Reagan?
Uh, okay.
Well, my company rents apartments for all of their transplants.
And I guess I didn't tell you about it because I'm scared, and I wanted a backup plan.
It checks out.
I just felt like if I came on too strong, It-it would scare you away.
That's why I lied.
- It checks out.
- I didn't want you feeling, like, you know, you were trapped in some sack.
Trapped in a sack?
I don't want you to feel trapped in a sack.
I wish you had used a less alarming analogy.
Yeah, women are always afraid of being trapped in sacks.
It's a little dark.
Will you just kiss her already, dude?
Please tell me you don't know this guy's name.
- I don't know the guy's name.
- That's good.
That's a positive.
-  -  My name's Kevin.
Wow.
Cowboy hat, hockey jersey, drinking from a Styrofoam cup.
You called it perfectly, Cece.
Pick yourself up.
Figuratively and literally, 'cause we still haven't fumigated for weevils.
Let the weevils take me away.
It was just a song.
Okay?
Your taste is your taste.
It doesn't matter who else likes it.
Yeah, I mean, look at Cece, for instance.
She's still rocking that Planet Hollywood jacket, and that thing is ugly as hell, man.
Like, it's a really terrible jacket, and I don't get why she wears it.
I mean, take Winston, for example.
He eats onions like apples.
It's disgusting, his breath smells bad, it makes no sense, but Yeah, man.
I be eating them things right down to the core, man.
- Yeah, and you like EDM.
-  - You know what else you like?
-  A brand-new - fancy chair!
-  Chair?
I thought this was the base of a fish tank.
-  Here you go, man.
-  Happy birthday, Schmidt.
It's not his birthday.
Then why are we doing this?
Schmidt, you love this chair, right?
- Told you to sit on it, Potsie!
-  The store had free delivery.
I don't understand what's going on.
I know.
We just do things sometimes.
I never understood it either.
-  Is it comfortable?
- Absolutely not.
It's a Haberman.
Play some music from my mobile device, that we created, you and me.
Come on.
You know you love it.
Let us see it in your feet.
Dance!
Haberman.
- There we go!
- Whoo-hoo!
-  - Haberman.
Yeah.
- Yeah, feel it.
- Yay!
Whoo!
No!
So, this is my life now?
Yep.
Welcome home.
Y'all okay with this?
-  - Haberman.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 To Cece, for booking her first client's first modeling gig.
Hey!
-  Cheers.
- And to Winston for making Donovan the face of LAPD's recruitment campaign.
I just hope he doesn't look better in blue than I do.
- Wink.
- Oh, he definitely will.
He's a model.
So in honor of this occasion, we all got you gifts for your home office.
You may know it by its former name, the dining room table.
Me first.
A cubicle, - swinging balls, - Mm.
an outgoing mailbox, a cartoon that is very derogatory towards Mondays.
- So thoughtful, babe.
- Will that mailbox be functional?
If it wasn't, it would just be a box, wouldn't it?
So can I buy a stamp for this letter?
It's not a post office, man.
- Who else has a gift?
- Whoo!
Bull button.
You press that, guaranteed crowd pleaser.
-  Bull!
- Ooh!
I got something better.
Noise-canceling headphones.
Thank you.
Wow.
- Yeah, are those mine?
- Yes.
- They're broken.
- Oh, nothing is ever truly broken.
All right, well, I got you a filing cabinet to file all the headshots of your clients.
FYI, Ferguson's in one of those drawers making fluffies.
"Fluffies" is cat farts.
- Bull!
-  Do you have a stamp for this letter?
Is that a bill from when you were in the hospital?
Oh, this?
Yeah, it is.
Turns out they, uh, they charge for new knees.
-  - I feel so bad.
I should pay that.
- What?
Why?
- Seriously?
Oh my God, your bad knee!
Oh, my God!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But wait a second, why do you want to pay?
I turned your knee into a bag of marbles.
I should pay your medical bill.
This is my only bill, and it's just a baby bill.
You know, it's so small and cute, like my nephew Baby Bill.
- Give me that baby.
- I feel bad, but okay.
Wait, how did you -  - I studied pickpocketing when I played the Artful Dodger in my college production of Oliver!
Oh, wow, that's so cool.
- Oh, wait, so did I. - What Ow, Winston, straighten your arms when you eat.
You don't think I want to?
- Ain't no room, fam.
- Straighten your arms, fam.
- Then how am I gonna reach my food?
- Oh.
Okay, I'm sorry, the cubicle will be gone soon, but this is a real make-or-break moment for me.
Either I'll look back at this as my "Steve Jobs in the garage" phase, or that misguided month where I tried to be a manager at the dining room table.
You are absolutely Jobs.
And I'm Woz sitting next to you the whole time in a - slightly lower chair.
-  And speaking of jobs, by the way, you guys need to be like Winston and start getting jobs for Donovan.
Don't you basically work on ads for a living, Schmidt?
Yeah, well, my current account is for a menopause pill that eliminates night sweats.
Oh, you're repping EstroFuel?
Yes.
Chest bump.
You know, maybe I could use Donovan for the cover of The Pepperwood Chronicles.
I mean, he wouldn't be Pepperwood but - Gator!
- Oh, Gator!
- It's perfect.
-  - He could be a great Gator.
- Why don't you just use a real gator?
What?
Gator is Pepperwood's best friend - and clairvoyant brother.
- Mm.
Oh, my bad.
Sorry, I haven't read it yet.
- What?
-  What?
- Doesn't matter.
- Clear the next 24 hours.
- You haven't read it?
- It's really not that big of a deal.
I also don't have an extra hard copy so let's just talk about something else.
- Ooh, you can take mine.
-  I've highlighted the more sexual parts.
I'm not ashamed.
- Great.
- Great.
Now you get to read it.
Now I get to read it.
Robby's hospital bill is only $400.
- That seem low to you?
- Did he have a minor procedure?
No, he had what the doctors call "a full Frankenstein".
- They put dog bones in his knee.
- Then that's way off.
It's got to be much higher.
Do you think he thinks I can't afford the full amount?
What?
Teachers have money.
You guys know how large I live.
I'm flush with cash.
I'm paying that bill.
I'm going to the bank right now.
I'm probably gonna take a limousine.
Taking a limo to the bank.
What is she, a cartoon cat?
- He kills it every time.
- Every time, man.
I'm sorry we got in a fight.
- I feel close again.
- I'm not.
Okay, Donovan, you just caught a shoplifter and now you're celebrating with a street taco.
That's exactly it!
- Get him, Donovan.
- I love this.
- Get him, Cece.
- Yeah, okay.
Donovan, you're a natural cop.
Hey, what agency are you from?
2L?
Oh, um, hmm, I'm from an agency that is - uh, quite, um but - Cece's Boys.
Cece's Boys, where the men are boys, and the-and the boys are Cece's.
- All right.
- You like it?
I love it.
You're going downtown!
Anything you say, Officer.
Oh, hi, Jess.
- That was really good.
- Just laying down a stanky B line.
Cool, cool.
Hey, um, I feel like Baby Bill here has a lot of brothers and sisters.
So what's the real total?
No, Jess, that's it, I swear.
Come on, Robby, $400?
I know what's going on here.
You think I'm too poor to pay.
- I - But you know what?
Would a poor person do this?
How much is it?
How much?
Jess, I'm not gonna tell you, okay?
Unless you ask me repeatedly, in which case I'll eventually crack.
Damn it.
- What's the total?
- Uh..
no.
- What's the total?
- No.
- What's the total?
- Not gonna tell you.
: What's the total?
$200,000.
Seinfeld.
Moment of truth.
Yep, here it is.
So please don't feel any pressure to like it, even though I spent 7,000 hours writing it.
So without further ado, or as Pepperwood would say, "Ah-don't".
You'll get that when you read it.
Here it is.
Here it is.
I cannot wait to read this.
I cannot wait to R-E-A - Jess!
- Jess!
Hey, there she is.
Oh, me, hey.
Sorry to interrupt.
Are you re-reading The Pepperwood Chronicles?
It is actually my very first time.
- A TPC virgin.
- Yeah.
"Ah-don't" believe it.
- I'll get out of your hair.
- No, no, no, stay.
No, what is all that stuff in your hands?
I'm totaling my assets.
It's really bleak.
You can't say that and then not elaborate, right?
No, I feel like we should really unpack this.
- Really?
- Definitely.
Thanks, guys.
Well, Robby's medical bills are a fifth of a million dollars and I'm freaking out.
I almost rounded up all my ballet flats and sold them on flattyflattyboomboom.com, the premier website for used flats.
Well, there are other options.
There are other options.
Um, as somebody who passed the bar exam eight years ago, I could offer you legal expertise.
I could read the medical paperwork.
Oh!
An almost lawyer and a sort of doctor.
Lucky me.
Okay.
Strategy sesh in the cubicle.
I'll meet you guys there.
Or we can go all go together if you want.
- Together.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go together.
- Great.
I rewrote the EstroFuel ad to star a hunk, and I got Donovan the gig.
-  -  Whoo!
- Hey, everybody, - Yes!
I just want to let you know, I've thought about it, and I'm quitting modeling to focus on applying to police school.
Honey, that is a very radical career change, okay?
That's why I like it.
I can't be tied down.
Picture this: your mom has night sweats.
She needs relief.
Luckily, she has a handsome son to go pick up her supplements, because menopause isn't just about women anymore.
EstroFuel: putting the men back in menopause.
Starring Donovan.
- Wow.
-  That's wow, what an opportunity.
But I'm becoming a cop.
No.
No!
You are the face of EstroFuel.
- The shoot is tonight.
- Oh, my God, it's tonight?
And I told my boss that Cece's Boys would be there.
- You told your boss - Thank you, I'll see you there.
Winston, you ready for the tour?
- Hmm?
- The what?
Huh?
Yea  Here's what happened, let me explain this.
Um, I offered Don a tour of the precinct, he accepted, and now it's happening.
- Okay, Winston?
Winston!
- Yeah?
You better make sure that this is the worst tour that you've ever given anyone in your life.
And that's gonna be tough.
I've given some really bad tours.
Okay, does this rendering represent the incident in question?
There was way more blood.
Wait, come on, it was not this violent.
It was way worse.
Grown men fainted.
Jess, I found something.
The hospital billed Robby for the Larry King Preemptive Memorial Post-Op Recovery Suite.
That's obviously a mistake.
Uh, that's not a mistake, actually.
I needed a private room because a lot of times in my dreams, I'm thinking about concerts that I really enjoy going to, so it's just a lot of me clapping and singing along.
I can't afford this.
Well, you don't have to, just let me pay.
No, you don't pay.
I pay!
What if no one pays?
From my drawing, I don't see any signage.
Do you see any signage?
So here's my question.
Do you remember seeing any safety signs near the machine?
- This is important.
- There was just a poster saying that they were closed on Veteran's Day.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Folks, we got a lawsuit.
- Good job.
- Great.
Seriously, guys, just let me pay this.
Say that one more time.
Say that you're gonna pay one more time and see what happens.
Wow, okay.
You know what usually calms me down?
- A good mall walk.
- No, we're suing the gym.
Nick, take it away.
Well, I would love to, but legally, I can't practice law.
Yeah, I have a really good lawyer, she's an animal.
So you're on board now?
- Yeah, I just go with the flow.
-  I'm gonna call my gal.
- We need the office.
-  What's wrong?
Yeah, so, Schmidt booked Donovan a photo shoot at Ass Strat, but Donovan just quit modeling so that he could become a cop.
-  - A cop?
It's my boss, Kim.
: God, I hate her.
Hello, Kimberly.
You sound like your skin looks amazing.
All right, Reagan, you can get to reading.
We can stick around if you want us to.
- I don't think it's necessary.
- You need us?
- We'll stick around for you.
- I don't think so.
Yeah, we'll stick around.
- Winston!
- Winston!
Me!
Did you make police work look as boring as possible?
I want so badly to tell you yes, but there was a situation.
Protect and serve, more like protect and snooze.
: Yeah, this is boring.
Bishop, a word.
And the word is "moo".
Moo!
Shut up!
I-I'm the C.O.W.?
I'm the I'm the cop of the week?
Celebrate good times Moo moo Celebrate good times Moo moo I'm home!
Well, congratulations, Winston, on finally making C.O.W. And damn you!
Cece, we're gonna have go put out a menopause fire.
-  Let's go!
- I made C.O.W., though.
I made C.O.W., we ain't forgetting about all that.
Okay, so, my lawyer says I don't have a case against the gym because I signed a waiver.
A waiver?
Jess, you did not say anything about a waiver.
Was that it?
She didn't advise me on anything else.
Okay.
No one says the word "advise" unless they got advice, so what did she advise?
Uh oh, no.
- What did she advise?
- She didn't it just wasn't - What did she advise?
- It didn't Come on, what did she advise?
- She advised that I sue!
- I knew it!
Who?
You.
Me?
- Nick, can I read your book?
- I was just about to suggest it.
-  Let's get out of here.
- Schmidt and Cece need me.
- Whoa!
God, what's that smell?
-  I'm not gonna sue you, Jess.
Was that not clear?
I told my lawyer that you're just an innocent bystander.
Okay?
So, if we can, uh, hit the mall?
I mean, there is a big sale at this Japanese cereal store.
It sounds amazing.
You really think I was an innocent bystander, do you?
- Is that bad?
- Yeah.
I'm just saying that I don't really think that you, uh, ever do anything wrong.
-  Anything?
Ever?
- Oh, we're starting to get into this.
Look I know a great place where we can hash this over.
It's a place called Hash It Over.
It's in the food court at the mall, it's a hash brown We're not going to the mall.
- Why are you watching - Why am I watching you?
Why are you?
- I'm not anymore.
- Okay.
Weird to watch.
That's why I'm not gonna do it.
- Great.
- Bye.
I thought this was about a bill, but apparently, it's about our whole relationship.
How could I date someone who doesn't see me realistically?
- No, but, Jess - I mess stuff up all the time.
Ask Nick.
He knows.
Nick, do I mess things up?
You know it, baby.
Bye!
I promised I wouldn't come back, but it is a little uncomfortable out there.
-  -  Jess, I know that you have flaws.
- Okay, name one.
-  Uh  Easy.
You walk too fast through a museum.
Although, it is pretty good, because we get to see everything and then we have time for the cafe afterwards.
I'm gonna say that overall it enriches the experience.
That is just a compliment!
I will be in the cubicle drinking myself numb.
- Please, keep fighting.
- Appreciate it.
I am paying a top-notch photographer to sit around and bitch about how hard it is to find French cigarettes in Los Angeles.
- Where's the model?
- Changing.
Yeah, um, uh, Donovan, are you almost ready?
I am changing.
I am Donovan.
What agency did you use again?
Cece's Boys.
Look Cece herself showed up.
She's very hands-on.
That's your wife.
I've met her many times.
Schmidt, if this falls through Look, my client will be here, and if for some reason he's not, that is on me and only me.
I'm gonna go shout into a toilet.
Okay, well, what are we gonna do now?
Babe, we are not gonna do anything, okay?
You have done so much for me, more than any normal person, and I love you.
But if I am gonna graduate from the dining room table, I need to learn how to manage my clients on my own.
Okay.
Oh, man, that was intense.
Uh, also, Schmidt, I printed something do you know where it went?
- Not now.
- Okay.
Okay, it's voice mail.
Donovan I know that you don't want to be tied down, okay?
But that's why being a model is perfect for you.
Because if you're a cop, then you're just gonna be a cop.
But if you're a model, then you can be everyone.
You can be an ice cream man, a rocketeer, a jewel thief, or an underwear guy in a 10 million dollar loft whose only furniture is a telescope.
So, help me help you become the everyone that you can be!
- That's how you do it!
- That was awesome!
- Yes!
- Right?
That was amazing.
It felt good.
- You think it worked?
- Couldn't tell you.
I know you're capable of messing up.
Really?
Because you won't even admit that the gym thing is my fault.
Your lawyer wants you to sue me, and frankly, I agree with her.
- So sue me.
- I am not gonna sue you.
Then how can I ever trust you?
That doesn't make any sense.
You know what?
If you're not gonna sue me, - then get out of here.
- Fine.
But I will tell you this: you will not be hearing from my lawyer.
- Bye, Nick.
-  See you, Robby.
I forgot you were there.
Reagan was right.
These noise-canceling headphones are really broken.
I could hear everything.
God, why are tiny rakes so soothing?
You know, I think I'm finally starting to understand momentum.
Which, apparently, my book does not have.
Nick, everyone loves it.
Robby wrote fan fiction for it.
- He wrote fan fiction?
- : Yeah.
- That means the world to me.
- He loves it so much.
Don't take this the wrong way about Robby, but he is way too good for you.
-  - He's way too good for everybody.
I know.
What is wrong with me?
Oh Any insight, ex to ex?
Of what's wrong with you?
- Oh, this feels like a trap.
-  Well, you know, maybe when things are going good, you get scared and you look for reasons to doubt it.
Yeah.
Is that what happened with us?
I mean, I can't begin to understand what happened with us, but maybe.
So, what are you gonna do about Reagan?
I don't know.
Her opinion means a lot to me, so Well, I think that's good you're letting yourself be vulnerable.
Was I not that with you?
Who knows what happened with us?
We were just kids.
Like you had a box, and I wanted you to get a bank account.
- Well, they're kind of the same thing.
- Well You wanted to live on a lake; I wanted to live on Mars.
You wanted to be a truck driver on Mars, - which is impractical.
- Well, I need to work.
I need to work.
- I don't want to fight with you.
- Let's not fight.
Let's not get into the details again.
Look, to getting older and wiser.
And hopefully, a little bit better.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
All right, time to face the music.
: Yeah.
Relationships are so hard.
I know.
But we can't stay in here forever, can we?
No, we can't.
No, we can't.
Okay.
I'm taking the gin with me, though.
Alcohol is kind of a cubicle for the insides.
Nick, you're like a drunk Maya Angelou.
Not the first time I heard that.
No, I don't want to buy your weed.
Yes, I understand how primo it is.
Well, Donovan's mom is a dead end.
Ooh, hey, Kim.
Look, it's Donovan.
: Hey.
That's Winston.
I know these people, Schmidt.
I've met them, and their pictures are everywhere.
Why is everyone standing around?
- Yes!
- Donovan!
Sorry, Winston, I can't be a cop.
My manager convinced me to be a model.
Welcome to Cece's Boys, Donovan.
Oh, yes.
Kim is happy.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Cool windbreaker.
- Is that new?
- Yeah.
I just went to the mall; I did a little retail therapy.
Yeah.
Look, I'm really sorry about today.
I shouldn't be looking for things to go wrong.
It's just a thing that I do.
I'm sorry, too.
I mean, sometimes I act more like a superfan than a boyfriend.
And I don't want to do that with you.
I don't want to do my thing, either.
It's going really well.
Especially considering it started with you dropping 175 pounds of iron on my face.
So you admit it's my fault!
Okay, I'll admit that it's half your fault.
I mean, look, I could have yelled out and said "stop" or something, but I wanted you to kiss me.
And hey, I'm paying that medical bill, okay?
Because I'm rich.
Okay, fine.
But I am knitting you $200,000 worth of scarves.
- Final offer.
-  Deal.
Now stand still I'm coming in for the romantic gesture.
Oh!
Are you wearing perfume?
- I hugged a limo driver.
-  - Oh, my God!
Nick!
- Geez.
: Oh, my God.
Oh uh I, uh Fell asleep on my book.
It's okay.
Agatha Christie's husband, David notoriously hated her writing.
Hated it.
But they had other things, you know?
They had surfing, dogs they they rescued a lot of dogs had electric sex I'm afraid I'm not gonna like your book.
Thank you for stopping me I don't even know what I was talking about.
I don't know anything about Agatha Christie.
Honestly, I've never really liked fiction.
It puts me to sleep.
Okay.
That helps, to know that.
Why didn't you just say that before?
I was embarrassed, and I didn't want you to think that I'm not excited to read your book, because I am.
I am excited.
So you're excited to read my book, you just might fall asleep when you read it, but it's not personal.
Yes.
: Okay.
- It's a lot of pages.
- It is, yeah.
Would it help if I read some of it out loud?
Just so you get the New Orleans flavor?
I think it will.
: "Julius Pepperwood loved three things in his life "his gumbo "his sex "and more of that sweet gumbo.
"Her legs were as long as the deep" You have got to be kidding me!
Just kidding.
What's wrong with the house again?
Well, I'm just worried about this one room.
- Mm-hmm.
- It feels like it's becoming your home office.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that you did this!
It's It's so amazing.
- Look at that.
EstroFuel.
- And a framed, shirtless picture of you.
Well I'm the original Cece's boy.
OGCB fo' life.
I love it so much, babe.
I love it so much, I can't wait to start working here.
And I'm gonna start working here right now.
This very second while there are no distractions.
N-no d no distractions.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
Total silence.
It's incredible.
What a sanctuary.
Complete silence.
You got it.
I love you.
Have fun.
You No distractions.
Abort.
Abort.
Abort.
But Robby wrote a Cece's Boys theme song for the band.
-  Schmidt?
- Scatter!
Scatter!
Go, go!
Los Cece's Boys.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1  They've scored five touchdowns in this game Wow.
Check this out.
Coach and May's foreign exchange student just added me as a friend.
Montsie.
His name is Montsie.
I didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.
I didn't know they moved to North Carolina.
- Neither did I. -  - They moved to North Carol what?
- Yeah.
How did none of us know about this?
How is that possible?
- Eh, they moved.
It happened.
- We need to make more of an effort.
We don't even know that our friend has moved to a different state.
I mean, we're still friends.
We just have nothing to do with each other.
This doesn't bother you?
Realistically, we'll probably see 'em two or three more times before we die.
And it's sad, but it's also not that sad.
- What?
- Who cares?
What's for dinner?
I care.
McKenna, please.
Please, don't do this.
Okay?
I mean, what about that formal swimwear ad I got you?
McKenna?
McKen?
Well, guys!
It happened again.
A big agency stole another one of my clients.
And I have a big audition today.
- Gosh darn it.
You know what?
-  Jess!
Those pretty boys don't deserve you.
Which one is McKenna?
Is he the gaunt, heroin-hot one?
That's Jean Francois.
He got poached last week.
McKenna's the one that looked like a jacked Bryant Gumbel.
- Oh - And this is a huge deal!
It's the Sausage Crunchies account!
Why would a dog food company be interested in a bunch of hot models?
- Oh, no, it's, uh -  No, no, no.
Sausage Crunchies are people food.
They're like brown cheese snacks.
Yeah, it's like space food.
I-I put them in soup.
I just really wanted to show this casting agency that I was legit.
Now, if I go down there with just Donovan, I'm gonna look like a no-name hustler.
- Gosh darn it.
- Should I go out now, and try to find new clients, or should I concentrate on the one client that I have left?
You know, they're probably sniffing around Donovan as we speak.
Crap.
Is that what he wants to talk to me about?
He said he wanted to talk to me about something.
Is that what he wanted to talk to me about?
- These poachers.
- Cece Cece, calm.
You concentrate on Donovan.
I'll go see if I can drum up some new clients.
Very sweet, but the audition is in six hours from now.
So we have no time to look for new clients.
Well, recruiting is just like sales, I mean selling a job is just like selling drugs.
I do that every day.
Are you offering to help, too?
Honestly, I wasn't.
But based on how intensely you're staring at me, I guess I've boxed myself into a corner here, so Great!
Okay.
You concentrate on Donovan.
We'll get the models.
Heads in, guys.
- What?
- "Heads in"?
- No.
It's "hands in".
- I'm pretty sure it's "heads in".
What are we supposed to do?
Smoosh our heads together?
- Yeah.
- Everybody.
Hands in.
- Hands in.
- Hands in.
Meow.
-  Winston!
- What?
- How are you not tired of this?
- Tired of what?
Okay, model types, 3:00.
- Take a bow.
- Wait, those two oatmeal men?
Follow my lead.
How did we ever date the same dude?
: Hey!
Kampai.
That's Japanese for "What's up"?
Hi!
Jessica Day.
What are we celebrating?
Kirby here works for a marine biologist.
and he got them to name a new species of sea slug after me.
- Oh!
- It's called Bruce's Eastern Sea Slug.
You two are fascinating.
Have you ever considered modeling?
-  I actually have.
A-a lot.
- Us?
- I have a rich fantasy life.
- Oh.
I can't wait to hear more about that.
Sounds so great.
What are you doing?
Those guys are obviously not model material.
Because they're not cookie-cutter hot?
Cece needs a bunch of different guys, so don't judge a book by its cover.
Except when you're talking about models.
Models exist to be on covers.
I think that's an oversimplification.
I think the best models have something to give them a little personality.
Something, something that makes them stand apart.
Like a gap in their lower teeth, or a neck nipple.
You're making this way too complicated.
Look, this is all it needs to be you walk up to a hot guy, okay?
And you say "Hey, you're hot.
"Do you want to be a model"?
You have to forge a connection with them.
And that way they entrust us with the thing that makes them really beautiful.
You know what?
You do your thing.
I'll do my thing.
But your thing cannot be going back to the slug guys.
Sea slugs, Reagan.
They're sea slug guys.
But you're right.
You're nasty about it, but you're right.
So, Donovan, you have something you want to tell me?
I've made a big decision.
No, Donovan, don't.
I'm gonna stop wearing beanies.
- Wait, what?
- I think.
I That's what you wanted to talk to me about?
I thought some big agency was trying to poach you.
No.
They've just been sending me baskets and trying to take me to fancy dinners and stuff.
What?
They've just been giving me baskets - and trying - Listen to me, okay?
I know that gift baskets are great.
- Yeah.
- They are.
But once BGE signs you, there are no more baskets.
Because they don't care about you.
All they care about are numbers.
But you, Donovan, you are my first priority.
So when you're with me, you will never feel neglected.
Just tell me what you need.
I got you.
I need someone to help me get better at tricks on my motorcycle.
Sure.
Mmm.
I really hate these things.
I just can't stop eating 'em.
I got to say, the taste is average, but the aftertaste is outstanding.
What happens when I'm just an outstanding aftertaste?
Hmm?
When I move out, are you guys gonna forget about me like Coach?
This loft is what tethers us together.
And once it's gone, we're gonna be spread across the Earth like Rod Stewart's offspring.
What I'm gonna miss most about you is all this poetry.
No, no, no.
You know what, do not give up on us already.
We just need to find something that keeps us together.
Like a dark secret or a time-share.
You know, it was easier when men went to war.
You'd forge an unbreakable bond in a crucible of blood and pain.
You can't get that splitting the cost of toilet paper.
We just need to come up with some sort of ritual.
Yes!
Now you're thinking.
We stand in a circle, right?
- We burn chicken bones, all right?
- Dear Lord, Winston.
- Then we're just secretive about it.
- This is the wrong ritual I'm just saying no one knows about it.
- I didn't literally mean a ritual.
- Oh.
I just mean, like, a shared experience, one that bonds us together.
I've been saying this for the longest time, but I'm really ready to get super weird into metal detectors if you guys are.
- That's, sure, that's one idea.
- You can look for treasure.
Nickels, dimes, quarters.
If you find enough, um, said treasure or change, supplement your income.
It's also entertaining.
While looking, there's, uh, an endorphin rush.
It's entertainment, it's income uh, ritual.
Why don't we get tracksuits and play chess at the park?
I already got a chess crew.
You do that right outside of the loft?
- Yeah, right outside the loft.
- How have I never seen you once?
'Cause you don't go outside of the loft.
That's just not true.
Fellas, fellas, fellas, I got it.
Yeah?
Metal detectors?
That's a super cool idea, man.
I appreciate the idea.
I want to hear more about it.
I feel like I'm being teased.
Let me guess, you guys are pre-gaming before your high school reunion.
You were nerds, but you grew up to be super handsome.
You were cool but approachable.
Maybe you were rollerbladers Okay.
Here's the deal.
You're all models now, and that's your new manager.
H-hold on a sec.
There's only one number on this card, and there's two of you.
Oh.
You think we're trying to pick you up, because we're at a bar and we're telling you how handsome you are.
Excuse me.
You're hot, and you're about to make the easiest decision of your life.
Not interested.
He's a brown-eyed handsome man Don't tell me.
Only child, right?
I guess now I am.
As of yesterday.
Sorry, did you did you It's loud.
Did you hear what I, I said?
I said you were hot.
Um, have you ever thought about modeling?
Lady, you can't treat me like a piece of meat.
Now, I know I'm hot, but I don't need your validation.
We're trying to have a serious conversation here about why the bees have disappeared.
He hit a high fly into the stands If a couple of guys in a bar can't figure it out, who will?
He was headed for home It was a brown-eyed handsome man They won the game, it was a brown-eyed handsome man They won the game It was a brown-eyed handsome man.
So, how'd you do?
Got a couple irons in the fire, so Me, too, me, too.
Planted a couple seeds, just waiting for the harvest.
Hey!
Hey, you.
Stop what you're doing right now.
What?
I'm sorry.
That's just how I walk.
If I don't swing my arms, I start thinking I'm standing, and I'll fall.
Oh  Tell me, do you have any modeling experience?
I was trapped in a window display in a department store once, and I was on the news a lot.
Are we talking local or national news?
Oh, that's a good question.
Um I think sorry what my friend is trying to say is that it sounds like you have on-camera experience, and if you would like, we can hook you up with a top talent manager who could get you an audition today.
I do like hooking my thumb into my belt loops, and pulling my pants down Yeah.
No.
Don't do it now.
But it is called "The Cowboy".
And I can see it's not your first rodeo.
Okay.
Uh, your new manager's name is Cece.
Go to that address.
Thanks.
Okay.
No, don't say it.
- We're a team.
- No.
I'm the bait, you're the hook.
I don't think the bait usually thinks of the hook as its teammate.
That's such a hook thing to say.
You're such a hook.
You know I've always wanted to have a boys spa day.
Nick, did you wear your shirt during the massage?
I did, but no bottoms.
- It was liberating.
- Good for you.
Check this out.
These cucumbers are gratis.
I'm gonna make some pickles.
If you're impressed by a couple of free cucumbers, get ready to have your blind blown, 'cause I signed us up for the elite package.
Does that mean the pickle's already pickled?
- Gentlemen, eucalyptus towels?
- Thank you.
Oh, yeah uh, mine's already wet!
No, no, no, it's for smelling, not drying.
- Oh.
- Put it up to your face, smell it.
Mmm.
How could a smell be both hot and cold at the same time, I ask.
- It's nice.
- Ooh, this place is dope.
Man, I feel very Roman.
Boys, I think we found our ritual.
Yeah, we did.
If you gentlemen are ready, I can take you to your Brazilians.
Sounds very fun.
- I'm in a relationship, myself.
- Yeah.
Uh, but I would love to look.
Just point me to the door, please.
Sir.
The elite package at S'Pa includes the wax removal of hair from your nether regions.
What did you say, homeboy?
Scrotum wax.
No, Schmidt.
- Say something.
- Say something to him.
Donovan.
I have some very good news.
I have a brand-new client that I am very excited for you to meet.
- I'm Dean and I'm a model.
- Mm-hmm.
But I'm a model.
- No.
I'm a model.
- Yeah, both models.
- No.
I'm a model.
- No.
I-I am a model.
I am I'm the model.
- But, like, I'm, but I model.
- I'm a model.
- I model.
- You - I'm a model.
- I just told I'm a model.
- Astro Fuel.
- I model.
What the heck is going on?
Well, Cece's Boys is growing, so I'm just gonna help Dean make a rÃ©sumÃ© for the big audition we're all gonna go on.
- What about my rÃ©sumÃ©?
- You already have a rÃ©sumÃ©.
Well, I-I-I want another one.
- And another sandwich.
- I want a sandwich, too.
Stop copying me!
Donovan.
Dean.
Um Hmm.
No The line between what we're doing - and being creepy is so thin.
-  Hey, Cece, what's up?
Any luck?
The audition's in an hour, I'm getting kind of panicky.
Yeah.
Totally.
Um we're just looking for that perfect Cece's Boys type, you know - perfect.
- Ow!
I don't know hair this short can get so tangled!
- Okay?
- You're hurting me.
- I'm very sorry.
-  Cece, I don't know how many buttons to do on my shirt.
Donovan, please.
Look, Jess.
If you haven't found anyone by now, maybe I should just cut my losses.
Maybe I should just tell them I only No, no, no, no, no.
We actually, um  we have two guys, we'll - You do?
Oh!
- bring them right over.
You are the best.
Thank you!
I'm sorry?
I'm gonna be honest.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
Oh, it-it's the other one.
- No.
- They have a real look.
What look would that be?
I own my own dog-walking company?
Branding!
You're good.
You know what?
I believe in them.
And we also have no other choice.
So let's get them camera-ready.
How far away is that camera gonna be?
Okay, guys, let's go Oh, hey, Kirby.
Looking good.
That is for cats.
But it's okay.
Put this on.
They're from my roommate's earthquake kit.
He has a three-week supply.
Bruce.
Put this on.
They won't recognize you on your next volunteer shift at the hospital.
Ah.
Jess.
Hallway.
Okay, are you absolutely sure that this is the way to go?
Can't we get our hands on, like, a water polo team?
Or hire escorts?
Or call in a bomb threat to the audition.
In this political environment?
Oh, I'm nervous even saying it.
- What about nothing?
- No!
Is nothing maybe the right thing to do in this situation?
We can't bail on Cece.
This is her shot.
We can't let her become irrelevant like chunky belts, or quoting Borat.
Okay.
Well, if I have to go down with the ship, I'm not going down without a fight.
And those two are gonna need a lot more than hair gel and V-necks.
They're gonna need motorcycle boots, scarves, knit caps, and all the eye makeup that Schmidt's got.
DEAN : Cece?
Hello?
Cece?
What are you doing in here?
Donovan told me to wait here in your break room - and then he left.
- What?
!
And I couldn't open the door and it was really dark.
Donovan, get in here right now!
Donovan, we have an audition in an hour and you lock Dean in a closet?
Well, you said I was your number one client.
Okay.
No.
Wait, Donovan.
- I'm out of here.
- Just calm down.
Wait.
I went the wrong way.
Don't look.
: So, what are we thinking?
I don't know.
Maybe they give you something to bite down on.
No, I'm talking about leaving!
You're being so dramatic right now.
I don't think I'm being dramatic.
Look, I'll say it now without any drama.
I don't want the hairs ripped off my testicles by a stranger.
I think they're there for a reason.
They are trained professionals in there.
This isn't gonna be some back-alley sack waxing.
They have those?
I'm sure they do, but this isn't one of them.
Who would go to that one?
Well, sometimes, in an emergency, you got to do what you got to do.
What would the emergency ever be?
Nick, this is gonna be like cottage cheese all over again.
At first, you're gonna be kicking and screaming, saying that you don't want to try it, but I'm telling you, in the end, you're gonna tell everybody that you meet how much you loved it.
- This is nothing like cottage cheese.
- Exactly like cottage cheese.
Guys, I have off-the-charts follicle strength, okay?
It'll be a blood bath down there, a real crime scene, so I'm leaning, "No".
I'm out!
Like my mother says at every party she goes to, "No one touches my purse".
- Good day.
- Wait.
Sit.
Sit down.
You guys don't need to leave.
Just a minute ago, you were saying how much you love this place.
Just don't get your sack waxed.
Okay, I don't care how big the park is.
If there is a loose bear in it, I'm not going in the park!
I'm never going in that park again!
- I'm never going in again!
- But this is our ritual!
Schmidt, we'll just find a new one.
Easy for you to say.
You two guys are still gonna be living together in the loft, saying, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
"I didn't know you were in here in the bathroom".
And coming up with clever names for the Wi-Fi network - like, "This Is 4D".
- That's pretty good.
I'd say we just let's agree right now to switch it to that.
Points is, is your lives are going to go on, and I'll just always be that weirdo you once lived with.
So you know what?
I am gonna get my sack waxed.
So enjoy the rest of your lives together.
I'm gonna go shuck this corn.
Oh, man.
Hey, do you think they'll take a picture of him just as they rip like they do on roller coasters?
I think you missed the point of what just happened.
Did you just see that?
No.
I had my eyes closed.
I was saying a non-denominational prayer for Bruce and Kirby.
What did I miss?
That woman just checked out our guys.
Like, she-she really checked them out.
Maybe we have a chance.
I don't know.
- Did you hear what you just said?
- What?
You said, "Our guys".
- Okay, let's just go in.
- Our guys!
- Don't get sentimental.
- Our guys.
Oh, you get off of me.
Our guys!
Jess, I asked for models, not a couple of driver's ed instructors!
I know, Cece, but they're hot on the inside.
Bruce teaches CPR to children with irregular mouths, and Kirby has given so much bone marrow, they told him to stop.
I don't know how that's gonna help them at a print ad audition.
You're right, she's right.
I don't know what we were thinking.
Let's go put these dogs down.
Why did we even give them names?
They came with names.
Right, I guess what I meant is why did we bothering learning them.
Guys, uh, there's been a little hiccup.
- We're allowed to eat all these, right?
- I just love them.
Yeah, you guys can keep eating.
Um, so, there's no way to sugarcoat this, but the truth is  Wait, wait, wait - So gross, right?
- Ooh, nasty!
Cece?
Cece, come here.
- What?
- Look around this room.
Nobody's eating these things but them.
Oh, my God, yes!
And they love them.
It almost makes me want to try them.
And I emphasize "almost".
They're making a mistake.
These are the guys that can sell this stuff.
Not these guys.
But they've already decided on the direction of the ad.
So tell them to change it!
I mean, what have you got to lose?
Hey, Joy.
I'm scared.
-  Don't you be scared, kid!
- Nick?
- We're here with you, buddy!
- Winston!
We don't need a ritual, Schmidt, 'cause you're not gonna lose us.
I thought we could've just told you that, but Winston thought we needed to show it.
Yeah, I thought that would be better.
You know, it makes more sense to me.
- Band of brothers.
- Band of brothers!
That's right, man.
Band of brothers, bro.
Band of brothers.
You know, I've been a little bit curious about it this whole time.
I just couldn't admit it to you guys, you know?
I think this would be more dignified if we did it in silence.
-  Of course.
- Yeah, let's do this in silence.
- Good luck, guys.
- I'm ready for you, lady.
Three friends going on the same silent journey, together, yet separate, alone, yet closer than ever.
- Nick?
- I'm all right!
-  Winston?
- Can you hear me, Schmidt?
!
You hang in there, you son of a  Aah!
This woman's ripping it off!
Ooh!
That's actually kind of warm.
Ouch!
No!
Okay, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out, time out!
: No, no, no!
No!
: Oh!
How many times do you freakin' do it?
!
Okay, good.
You both are here.
So, guess who got the Sausage Crunchies job.
-  Oh, yay, Kirby!
- Hey, Kirby!
Not Kirby, but I am going to hang on to him.
I think he could book ads for both fast food and anti-depressants.
- Ah.
- Bruce?
They absolutely hated Bruce.
He got sick during the audition.
- Sausage Crunchies everywhere.
- That's a lot.
But they loved Dean!
Mm.
Oh, it's nice to see the good guys win.
Right?
!
They said I brought them the best and the worst of the day, so maybe that's my thing.
Hmm.
Can I throw out this, uh, soggy bag of cucumbers?
No!
Those are pickles in progress.
Um, I don't mean to be mean, but you guys are being real babies about this whole thing.
They don't Until you've had your sack waxed, you can't know this pain.
- Excuse me?
- Childbirth?
Weekly wax, top to tail.
We went through hell, and we came out the other side, gentlemen.
It was war.
Granted, one that took place in a high end-spa, but still our war.
-  - That's right.
I mean, this not something we do every week, right?
- No, it's like a monthly thing.
- Monthly?
- Not a chance!
- It's our ritual.
No.
No, no, no, no.
One time only.
Guys, how can it be a ritual if we only do it one time?
Shut up, Schmidt!
I will never go back!
It's okay, man.
We're gonna get metal detectors.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1 - Okay, we got our maps.
- Yeah.
- Got our canteens.
- Yeah.
Got our trail mix, homemade of course.
Got my book of local fauna.
Got my book of local flora.
So we can identify  Every living thing.
Look at them.
I feel like Andie MacDowell in Multiplicity, living in a house filled with clones.
It is the second time this week you've compared yourself to Andie MacDowell.
It's weird.
- I'll go grab - Our boots because we should - Break them in.
- Exactly.
Nah, that's weird.
Robby and I are hiking Behar Pass tomorrow.
Turns out, we both love hiking.
It's amazing.
We have a lot in common.
Aly and I are finally gonna have the same city in common.
- Right on, man.
-  Lefty's coming home.
- Lefty?
- Lefty?
Yeah, she's left-footed.
I'm throwing Aly a surprise welcome-home dinner.
I invited her whole family here, you know.
Uh, I wanted her to see all the people she loves, which becomes love for me, you know, and the next thing you know, I'm getting one of those "best boyfriend ever" mugs, which you can buy, I just don't want to do all that.
I want to I want to earn it.
- You're inviting them over here?
- Yeah.
Winston, this place is a hellhole.
Look at this.
All the dishes are broken.
I'm eating pasta out of some thing that Jess and Robby made in a clay class.
Pottery workshop.
What the hell is this compartment for?
I have a better idea.
Why don't you throw your thing at our place?
Ever since our wedding china came in, we've been dying to host a dinner party.
Is your house even done yet?
All the party zones are in working order: living room, dining room.
The master bedroom has sort of turned into a place where the workers throw all their trash.
I think even one of them went to the toilet in there.
- But - We'll just lock that door.
- Yes.
- Let's do it.
Reagan's out of town.
You know what that means.
- No.
- What does that mean?
Honestly, I don't know, but please let me come to the party.
Time to hit the sack.
It's 6:30.
Babies are still awake.
Not this baby.
I feel like I've lived through this before.
I'm like Andie MacDowell in Groundhog Day.
- Stop!
Just please stop.
-  Are you kidding me?
BOTH : Hike, hike, baby.
Ooh, it's a fork.
Well, the map says to go left, but that little musket trail seems plumb adorable.
And it has a waterfall, so I say, uh.
- waterfall.
-  I mean, let's just do it.
Let's go nuts.
See, this is why we're so great together.
We agree on everything.
- I agree.
-  Hey, Robert Frost, looks like we're gonna take the road Jess traveled.
All right, just, uh that's not the way it goes.
Hold on.
Be easier if it wasn't so windy.
Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Made a list of rules for our guests.
Obviously, no one's wearing shoes inside the house, but what if we put a foot-washing station in the driveway?
Babe, I was thinking maybe we have no rules.
Well, because growing up, all the cool houses didn't have rules, remember?
I was never invited to any of the cool houses.
My only friend in high school was my piano teacher, and then he got that boyfriend with the Trans Am, and I never saw him again.
I really wish I could travel back in time and give young you a hug.
Yeah, well young me would've greeted that hug - with an immediate collapse in orgasm.
- Oh.
But you know what, maybe you're right.
If we want to be the place where friends gather maybe we got to chill.
Yeah, because we we want to be the hub.
- You know?
- Ooh, we'd make such a good hub.
- Yes, we would.
- Make such a good we'd make such a good hub.
Are you having an orgasm right now?
Are you kidding me?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Winston Bishop, nice to meet you.
- What are we doing right now?
- I'm practicing introducing myself - to Aly's parents.
- Oh, I got you.
- You're a little nervous.
Okay.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a little nervous.
You know, I want to make a good first impression.
- Oh, that makes sense.
- How's my shake?
Nope.
No, no, no, no, no.
Do not go in with two hands.
Also, why are your hands so wet?
- Damn, for me that's dry.
- They're dripping.
- How's this for Aly's mom?
- I'm Aly's mom?
- Okay.
- Mm-mm.
-  Not today, honey.
- Yeah, all wrong.
- We bring it in for the real thing.
- All wrong.
- All wrong.
- Okay.
That was very aggressive.
You invaded my space.
I didn't feel safe.
Just be more normal about it.
Like this.
Hey, how are you?
I'm Winston.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, like Hey, how are you?
I'm Winston.
Zip, a pleasure, uh, to do it.
- See, all of that, cut that out.
- Okay.
Hi, how are you?
I'm Aly's mother.
You do you do well.
You do well to-to be friends with me.
- Hmm?
- Winston, shake it out.
-  I'm nervous, dude.
- I know you are.
Look, they're gonna love you.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna mill about.
I'm gonna talk you up.
I'm gonna tell your stories.
Yes.
Use one of my good ones, the ones that make me look awesome.
Like the time I fell asleep in the bathtub.
But all that one is is that you fell asleep in a bathtub.
- The end.
End of story.
- That's amazing.
I think we can come up with better ones, don't you?
No, that's a home run for sure, because I woke up wet.
- Now I see.
- And also, - it's all about how you tell it.
- Right.
I trust you.
You're the writer.
I am, and that was the gift I was given.
- Put her there.
- You got it.
- What is going on with these hands?
- What?
A second ago, they were dripping wet, and now they are piping hot.
- Leslie!
- Winston!
I hit your car when I parked.
Sorry.
Yeah, I I didn't drive here.
Oh, well, that's a relief.
Anyway, uh, your sister is on her way.
Where are your parents?
Oh, my dad doesn't take highways for political reasons.
- But everyone else is here.
- Cool.
Come on in.
- Hey.
- Hi there.
- Hey there.
- Hey.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
How big is your family?
Oh, my gosh.
Hey.
How many cars did you guys take?
Hey, make yourselves at home.
Everybody come on in.
Did you guys rent a bus?
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
- Hey.
Hey now.
-  Winston, Winston.
Winston.
A-a word, please.
- Huh?
Yeah, coming.
- Hey.
Hey, man, you look familiar.
Did I pull you over last week?
Why so many?
CECE : There are 30 people out there.
We do not have enough china!
Or forks or prawns.
You can't ask somebody to split a prawn.
Babe, I know, all right?
But you just need to relax.
- We will be fine.
-  - We can adjust.
-  Sorry.
Just remember, we're chill.
No, you're right.
We are totally chill.
We'll just break out the backup china!
I'll just come in tomorrow morning with a power washer, and hose this whole frickin' place down.
-  - There's Lefty.
By the way, there is no backup china!
- I know, I know, all right.
-  Keep them closed.
All right, last time you did this, you revealed Furguson in a tuxedo.
This is even better.
Say hello to your entire family!
Surprise!
: What the hell is this?
: So, do the cute, surprised look you do.
Nah, that's not it.
That's not the one.
Remember?
When you Oh.
You're pissed.
We're lost.
Why did you let me chase a waterfall?
You know what TLC says.
I'm sorry.
Just - I'm really hungry.
- Here.
You can have some of my trail mix.
That's just a bag of raisins.
Well, that's because I only like to eat the peanuts and the chocolate.
Well, I only like the chocolate and the peanuts, too!
Why do we even add raisins?
!
I don't know!
All right, look, you know what, we're lost and it's gonna get dark soon, so let's just head back.
Fine.
Did you pack a flashlight?
Robby, did you pack a flashlight?
- No.
- Then there's your answer.
You know what, it's fine, okay?
We know that we have to go downhill, so just follow me.
I'll lead, okay?
- Ah!
God!
Oh!
- Oh!
Robby!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
- I lost my glasses.
- Are you okay?
Oh.
Please tell me those were crunchy leaves.
Let me see.
Oh, I think that's them.
- Hold on.
Oh!
Jess!
- Ah!
Ah!
Ow, my ankle!
My beautiful dancer's ankle!
Hey.
What's the matter?
You know, I got all your family together in one room.
You know, you're being greeted by all the people that you love.
- I know.
- Well, except for your parents, but they will be here soon, barring any surface street traffic.
That is so sweet, Winston.
And I do love my family, but they're crazy.
And, honestly, they make me a little crazy.
Every family is crazy.
Every time we get together, it's a disaster.
Like a giant hot air balloon catching on fire.
Here's the difference: you got backup now.
Have I ever let you down as a partner?
Except for that mixed doubles tournament.
Got it!
We don't got to talk about that.
We ain't got to go back there.
My point is this: we're a team.
Okay?
- Okay.
- All right.
Maybe this time will be different.
- Right?
- Yeah.
But you really need to know the lay of the land.
Okay, let me take notes.
So, my sister is - my sister.
- Mm-hmm.
Uncle Bill is a real weather nerd.
- Super annoying.
- Right, right, right.
Aunt Karen keeps a free-floating piece of floss in her purse.
She will use it tonight.
- It's revolting.
- Okay.
Do me a favor.
Hold on.
Repeat everything you just said.
My thumbprint won't let me in.
Okay, uh, my sister is you met her Ah, wait, yeah, no, no, still not in.
Let me get wipe my hand off right there.
Now we're cooking with gas.
- My sister okay.
- No, we ain't.
- Winston, he's a great guy.
- Mm-hmm.
He and I go way back.
Tons of stories, tons of tons of stories.
Really?
All right.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
One time he was taking a bath and he fell asleep.
You believe this guy?
What a nut.
Life of the party, this guy.
He fell asleep in a bath?
That's the story?
That's the story?
No.
That's the start of the story.
We are out of appetizers.
They stripped this tray of shrimp like piranhas.
They didn't even leave tails.
I think someone took a shower in the bathroom.
We don't have towels or soap.
I don't know how they did it.
We need to re-examine this whole no rules thing.
It's a freaking circus in here.
What are we gonna feed these people in the meantime?
In about ten minutes, they're gonna start eating the drywall.
- I think there was a -  -  Thank you.
- Thank you.
I think there was a bag of rice in the house when we bought it.
I thought that was barley.
It was really dirty.
Okay, fine, whatever.
Boil it up!
Okay, well, it's really dark and uneven, but at least we found the trail.
Yeah, I mean, it's like a night hike.
Maybe we'll see a colony of bats.
It's kind of like a waterfall.
But with monsters, in the sky.
-  - Oh!
Oh, man.
Okay, uh, Jess, it's raining.
Let's take shelter in that cave!
What if it's more of a nest than a cave?
Whatever.
It'll do.
Sister!
Oh, that's some sisterly love right there.
- Let me get you two a drink.
- Okay.
Oh, my God, Winston is so good for you.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
And I saw with my own eyes one day when Winston saved those kids from a burning building, including a little boy.
A little boy who's dad left when he was young.
Named Wheelchair Timmy.
Wheelchair Timmy was a heavyset boy, ginger.
Black eyes.
So what, you think I'm just some cold robot who needs some guy to loosen me up, make me happy?
I just said Winston's good for you.
Oh, my God, you always get like this!
He grabs the kid and the chair, lifts him up above his head, so that the fire doesn't burn this little heavyset boy.
That's the power of adrenaline.
- And what happened to Timmy?
- Timmy?
He's dead.
- What?
- He's alive.
I'm Timmy.
Look at me now.
Because of Winston, I'm telling you this story.
No, you said your name was Nick.
I am Nick.
I got to go!
How should I be, huh?
Like you?
: "Oh, my God, look at me, I'm Leslie.
"I wear holiday socks in the summer.
"I follow Ariana Grande around like she was the Grateful Dead".
: "Oh, I'm Aly.
"I went to Quantico and I got a disease, "and I can't be around people"!
- Do you mean "quarantine"?
- Whatever!
You're so mean!
- You're being a mean robot!
- No, this is being a mean robot.
: "Beep, boop, boop, boop.
Leslie, you suck.
"You can't pull off bangs.
"You were an accident".
Oh, my God!
I have a small forehead, and you know that, and you use that against me!
Just shut up!
- I hate you!
- I hate you!
I  : God.
Oh, no.
The wheelchair boy, Timmy, speaks very highly of you.
- You're Aunt Karen?
- Mm-hmm.
You didn't make a lot of sense.
Yeah, it's really coming down out there.
- It's really freezing.
- Yeah.
Hey, Robby?
Do you ever think it's, like it's not good that we're so similar?
Oh, I don't know.
You know, my Great Uncle Shep Wallingford used to say, "You buy the horse that you see in the mirror".
- Did you say "Wallingford"?
- Mm-hmm.
I have Wallingfords in my family, out near Boston.
Ah, mine are in, uh, Newburyport.
They were kind of, like, local celebrities.
They were well-known for making - women's watches.
- Women's watches.
How'd you know that?
Wallingford watches  'Cause the time is now And the look is wow!
Robby I think we're related.
Do you have an Uncle Tony?
Tony, with the long fingernails, and he always wears a whistle around his neck.
Robby, we are third cousins.
- Oh, my God!
- Ah!
- Why, God?
!
- We're going to hell!
- We did stuff.
- No, stop!
- Just saying.
- I can't live in this reality!
- At least not second cousins.
- Ah, I can't.
- First cousins would be way worse.
- Please, no.
People do it all the time, in the, in the mountains.
In the mountains.
- Don't be startled.
- God!
What are you doing in here, Cece?
I am hiding, okay?
That party is out of control.
Some guy almost burned his eyebrows off trying to light a cigarette on our stove.
It's complete anarchy in there.
Can we just hide in here and hang out together?
We haven't christened the garage yet.
Ooh, you make a very good point.
- Okay.
-  Hey.
- Hello, Winston.
- Hey.
- Question: have you guys seen Aly?
-  What's going on, man?
She ran off.
If I'd known it was gonna be like this, I would've just done the trench coat thing.
- The what?
- What is the trench coat thing?
It's where I pick her up from the airport naked, wearing nothing but a trench coat.
Have you guys seen a kid in a wheelchair?
- That was me.
- What?
- Whoa!
- Wow.
Nick, what are you doing in here?
Look, I was having a hard time with your stories, so I took a little poetic license.
People started asking some questions.
Things got ahead of me.
And I had no choice but to hide in the car.
Nick, I thought you were gonna stick to the tub story.
It's not a story, Winston.
It's not a story!
- A story about sleeping - It's mental.
- It's really not - Hey.
- Found her.
- Yeah.
Hey, are you guys ever not together?
- Rarely.
- You know what?
Hold on one second.
I want to talk to you.
Guys, can you give us a minute?
Sure, Winston.
Cece, let's go hide in the car in the garage of our home.
Yeah, okay.
We'll give you guys a minute.
Aly, uh, I was just trying to be sweet and And I ruined it.
I know.
I said my family was crazy, and I ended up being the craziest one.
Look, I'm so embarrassed you saw that side of me, and I'm sure you want to run for the hills.
So, it's fine.
I don't blame you.
You're embarrassed of being crazy in front of me?
I acted insane.
Even just talking about it is humiliating.
I'm just gonna, yeah, I'm gonna walk away.
Okay.
Oh, dear Lord.
The car's running.
- Nick, how long have you been in here?
- Been running this whole time?
I was cold.
I was cold.
Did you ever go to one of those big Wallingford family cookouts?
Just one, in '92.
I remember they had a really competitive three-legged race, and they paired me up with a little boy who had a helmet on.
His skin was so translucent, it was like he was a jellyfish.
- Did he play an imaginary trombone?
- Yeah.
He kept saying, "It's better to be safe than speedy".
- That was me!
That was me!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, this is too much.
I don't want to die with my cousin-lover in a cave.
- Oh, God.
- Everyone will think we fled here 'cause society wouldn't accept us.
I just wanted to see a waterfall.
Me, too!
I got to get out of here!
You can't walk, I can't see anything.
Stand up, blind boy.
I'm getting on your back.
- Take these.
- Oh, okay.
Oh, man.
Okay.
We have the same prescription.
Yeah, no kidding, Robby.
All right, you ready?
- Yeah.
So, "Wallingfords" on three?
- No!
Ew!
I'm really sorry.
I'm so nervous.
- Okay, one, two, three!
- Two, three!
I didn't wear the right shoes for this!
Go over there!
I'm sorry about before.
I guess I really freaked out on you.
And I'm sorry that I told you I was gonna shave your eyebrows off in your sleep.
- You never said that.
- Oh, maybe I was just thinking that.
I'm just so embarrassed Winston saw that.
I'm pretty sure I scared him off.
No, you didn't.
He's on the table.
Oh, no.
- Oh, no, no, no.
-  Hello.
I am Winston Bishop.
I'm Aly's boyfriend.
Please, if you will, I want to, uh, say a few words to my girlfriend.
He's standing on the furniture.
Just relax, okay?
Help is on the way.
Aly, I wanted you to feel special tonight because I'm wild about you.
Maybe things didn't go perfectly, but damn it, don't be embarrassed to be crazy in front of me.
Okay?
I am the king of crazy.
I have inside jokes with my cat.
I am a member of the Puzzling Guild of North America.
I shave my face cold, - and I brush my teeth hot.
- It's true.
On one very late and very desperate night, I used Furguson's cat box as my own box.
And, yes, it is true what many of you have heard.
I once fell asleep in a bathtub!
I love that story.
And then what happened?
What do you mean, "And then what happened"?
He fell asleep in the tub!
He was asleep, and then he woke up.
I don't know, maybe I got to hear it again.
So who cares if you're crazy?
I don't care.
I'm crazy, too.
Watch this.
I'm gonna put a carrot behind my ear, like a bunny reporter, and I'm gonna do this dance I've been working on for five years.
Don't you do that carrot.
Little bunny carrot.
I see we got two new people here.
Who are they?
Yeah, um, Mom, Dad, this is Winston.
Hey.
Uh I am Winston.
And I assure you that all of those incidents were from a very long time ago, kinda.
It's clear you love our daughter.
In a very passionate, unique way.
That's all that matters.
You're a two-hander, huh?
Well, all right.
- Okay.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Seriously, we've been on the road for a couple of hours.
- We need to use the bathroom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course!
It's, uh, right down, right down the hall.
Thank you for not being afraid of me or my family.
-  - Open up.
Police!
- Who-who called the police?
- I don't know.
I guess we better do whatever they say.
Ugh.
Why are you guys acting like you're in a porno?
We got a noise complaint.
The law has spoken, everyone.
I guess the party's over.
You could just file out through here.
Winston?
: Look who it is.
Hey, Aly, you're back.
Jenkins, get in here, man!
We having a party.
- What you drinking?
- Hi, Jenkins.
Wait, what?
Well, you know what, I guess I'm just gonna have to take the law into my own hands.
All right, everybody!
Shoes off, coasters down!
This is our house, and our house has rules!
Okay?
Not a suggestion.
Shoes off, let's go!
- Okay, okay.
Shoes off.
- Shoes.
-  Take your shoes off - Get 'em off!
- and put 'em to the side!
- Yep!
- And then let's have a good time.
- Yeah, let's have some fun.
- It's a party, people.
- It's a party.
So just to be clear, um, we're definitely broken up, right?
Yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, that's - Yeah.
I mean I don't know why I asked.
Well Oh, wait.
You should take these.
Oh, you know, keep 'em.
They look great on you.
Thank you.
I'll see you around.
Yeah.
Maybe at the next family reun - Too soon.
Yep.
- A little too soon.
Yes.
- Oh, dear Lord.
- It's not as bad as it looks.
I'm really, I'm really clean underneath all this mud.
Oh, my God, what happened?
Hike took a turn, and then Robby and I broke up in a cave.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
I am so sorry.
- Air hug.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna go get you a glass of wine.
Real sorry about you and Robby.
Don't touch anything.
I'm gonna go get some paper towels.
Don't-don't move.
Whoa, Jess!
Are you okay?
Oh, long story.
But I'm okay.
Is there any food left?
I'm so hungry, and all I have is this bag of gross raisins.
Gross raisins?
Are you kidding me?
Raisins are the best.
I love raisins.
: Of course you do.
Yeah, sometimes I just tuck 'em in my cheek, and I go about my day, so if I ever need the flavor of raisins, well, I already got it.
I'm having trouble envisioning what it's like to need the flavor of raisins.
But go nuts.
Go raisins.
You said, "Go nuts," I said, "Go raisins".
Wine.
- Paper towels.
-  Oh, thank you, Schmidt.
Thanks.
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you.
-  Just step on these.
-  Go faster.
Uh, I have enough paper towels.
-  Hey!
-  Hey!
- Hey, what's up?
- Not much.
- Welcome to the party.
- Thanks.
Where's Robby?
Oh, yeah, um, he couldn't make it.
Turns out we're cousins, so -  What?
!
-  What?
-  He's your cousin?
-  House looks great.
-  Wait a second.
- Thank you.
- What?
- How did that happen?
Cousin?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
1 Well, this is the last of Robby's stuff.
How you doing with the breakup?
Really well, since we're related, and all the laws of nature say we should not be together.
If you guys need me today, I'll be in my room rearranging my furniture so it no longer resembles a place - where I made out with my cousin.
-  - Third cousin.
- Still.
- Ugh, barely better.
- Ew.
- Don't normalize it, Jess.
- Ugh.
- You're right, you're right.
- Ugh.
Hey, Nick.
Are you wearing your running bottoms and your hoodie?
Nick, are you going running?
Have fun.
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with Nick, Reagan?
Yeah, what happened?
Are you guys okay?
Nick is going for a run.
If anything, we should be asking what is right with Nick.
He only goes running if he's upset.
And he's wearing his sad hoodie.
And by the looks of it, it's been washed, which is bone-chilling.
He's fine.
Everything's okay.
I just passed Nick on the street running, on purpose!
Oh, my God!
Maybe I was wrong.
Nick!
Are you okay?
!
I see you!
And I love you!
In my defense, no one here emotes in a normal way.
- That's fair.
- Nick!
How's the boba?
It's fine.
Why are you making so much eye contact with us?
Oh, you're gonna ask us for something, aren't you?
The boba is a metaphor.
Aly is the tapioca pearl to my milky matcha, each made better by the unlikely presence of the other.
I think you know what I'm saying We have absolutely no idea.
I haven't known what you've been saying for three and a half years.
I'm asking Aly to marry me.
- What?
!
- Whoa!
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my gosh!
- Winston.
My man!
-  Yeah.
Yes.
And I'm gonna need your help with the process.
Now, keep this between us.
I am only telling you two.
- Yeah, we won't say a word.
Yeah.
- Whatever you need.
Meet me at the bar in one hour, okay?
Look fresh.
We'll discuss details.
I'm gonna need you for the entire day.
- We're with you.
- Yes.
Little Winnie is growing up.
First he's a husband and then maybe one day he could be a father One day?
I am a father.
- It's a cat, Winston.
- He's my blood.
I am never gonna figure him out.
I feel like I found a forest baby, and I don't know when it's hungry or in pain or afraid of the kitchen light.
I know.
Nick is just an enigma wrapped up in a bunch of Chicago Bears crap.
You need the help of a seasoned vet.
-  - Come in!
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.
You feeling upset about something?
No.
I'm just eating edamame.
Give me the cup.
- They taste so bad.
- That's what I thought.
I submitted The Pepperwood Chronicles to a publishing company, and I got the rejection letter today.
- My career is over.
- No, it's not.
Nick, someday you'll be talking to a reanimated Oprah about that book.
Have you talked to Reagan about this?
I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.
No, I am too embarrassed.
Nick, she's your girlfriend.
You have to let her in.
Don't just keep her in the perfect front room.
- Okay.
- Let her in the back, with the weird rooms and the-the dead bulbs and the wet walls.
All right, but I'm not letting her go anywhere near my crawl space.
I don't think you should let anyone near your crawl space.
Well, some people have to go to the crawl space to clean out the boxes.
Who cleans out the boxes?
Significant other.
What are you talking about?
Hey.
I have the scoop.
Nick's book got rejected, and he's really embarrassed.
So now the baton has been passed to you.
You own an actual baton?
It was Robby's.
He was really into competitive male twirling.
- I have so many questions - No.
First, thank you for coming to this very special event.
Might I just add that everyone looks fresh.
Now, when Aly gets here, I am going to suggest an activity for the four of us to do.
Then I'll gracefully back out, leaving the two of you to distract her, as I prepare for the show.
-  - Ooh, I got a scream and nowhere to put it.
Ooh, this is exciting.
Now, at an undisclosed time, I will place a call to Aly, informing her that my car has broken down in Malibu, where I'll be waiting with a beautiful and glorious picnic right next to her favorite plant the common cactus.
Here comes that scream.
Oh, my God, there she is.
Oh, I'm screaming already.
Aly!
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
Strange energy, guys.
We all had bubbly water.
It made us giggle.
- What's up?
What's up?
What's up?
- Hi.
Hello.
- What's up?
- Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
Anyway, uh, Schmidt and Cece asked us to help paint their house.
- Paint our house?
- Paint the house.
Remember?
That's the activity for all of us to do.
You know, 'cause you wanted you wanted Paint the house.
Paint the house.
Yes, we did.
Even though the majority of our house is already painted.
We wanted our best friends to finish it.
Not professionals.
Like, uh like our new home was some tree house in a Little League baseball movie.
I mean, I-I've never done it before, but Sounds like a yes to me.
Aw, snap, just remembered, I can't make it.
- Uh, uh, boo.
- Uh  - Yeah.
- Boy, that's a bummer.
- Shock.
So fast.
- Shoot.
- Ugh.
- But, you know, boo.
What up, boy in the hood?
I thought you were gonna talk to Reagan.
I tried, but she's been on her phone all day like a grandpa who missed a package.
Like "Hel" I'm not even gonna do it.
Yes.
Thank you so much.
We will be there.
Thanks.
Nick, I know that dumb publisher rejected your book.
And, guess what, that publisher can go to hell.
After you beat them to death with this baton that I weirdly still have.
Because you don't need a publisher.
You need a girlfriend who found a bookstore to sell Pepperwood.
Seriously?
That's amazing.
That's amazing!
I called all over and I finally found one.
Reagan saved the day!
- You're amazing.
- That's right.
All we need is, uh, 30 copies of the book.
Oh, well, we can make them.
I mean, it'll be hard, but we could do it.
We could do it.
We'll make 'em ourselves.
Fantastic.
Uh, we just need 'em by tonight for his big reading.
Excuse me, did you say "big" - "a big reading tonight"?
- Yeah.
Well, that sounds public.
Well, I mean, he's got to do a reading to sell the book.
- Is that bad?
- Is that bad?
No, it's good.
I get I get to do a reading tonight in front of people.
- Yeah.
- I get to read in front of a bunch of people who are gonna judge me.
This is not bad.
This is good.
This is   See, this is another thing that Nick does when he's upset.
At least he's not running.
So you want me to read in front of people.
You want me to read in front of living people : who are there to hear me read.
And how will I how will I even know what to read?
- You're gonna read your book.
- I'll read my book.
Fine.
This is good.
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
Oh, I feel like my heart is pumping out scalding hot toilet water.
See, a vivid description like that is gonna make the audience go wild.
Ah, the audience!
I just forgot the audience, and now I remember the audience.
I can't do this.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
All right, here it is The Pepperwood Chronicles.
I made a prototype.
Jess, that looks fantastic!
- That looks really good.
- How did you do that?
Oh, that's between me and my craft wagon.
I wrote you.
Hey, um, how's he doing?
- Not very good.
- Hmm.
And if I'm being honest with you, I'm starting to freak out now.
This is me freaking out.
Do I sometimes wonder if you're a robot?
- Yeah.
- I've made you!
- You're of me.
-  When Nick gets like this, he needs to be occupied.
Luckily, we have tons of books to make.
- It's got my name in it.
- JESS : Book time!
Gather around, my little Guttenbergs!
Here we go.
Hey, Jess, can I borrow your cactus gloves?
Ooh!
Making books, huh?
Butterfly in the sky I can fly twice as high Take a look It's in a book.
Ah, you know the rest.
Just, we put we put 'em there.
Backing away from an active craft project.
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
No.
Um, Reagan's a little insecure about being there for Nick.
- So I want her to have this.
- Oh.
- Wow.
I'm proud of you.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
-  This is where you give me the cactus gloves.
This is really soothing.
You're a natural.
: She's terrible.
She's ruining our bedroom.
It's like she's begrudgingly covering up graffiti.
Oh, there's a couple rough patches, but that's what posters are for.
Just calm down, okay?
We can fix it later, but we have to keep her in here for Winston.
Hey.
Since we're doing this, I got to say, do not like the color of your bathroom.
You know what?
Now that I think about it, me either.
- : What?
!
- Let's do that next.
- Great.
- It's special order robin's egg.
- It's just paint!
- It's not just paint.
Hey, guys as much as I love a good whisper fight, - I should go.
-  Oh, no!
No, no, no.
- You, uh, can not leave.
- Why not?
Because we can't be alone together.
- Because?
- Because because we're having marital problems.
That's secret, which is part of our marital problem.
She's got a big mouth, but a great can.
Which is also part of our marital problems.
I objectify her.
See.
I knew something was up.
Everyone was like, "They're so perfect"!
And I was like, "No.
Something in that relationship "is very, very broken".
Hey, Nick.
Where's Reagan?
Getting more glue.
We ran out.
How many did you get done?
One and I think we did it wrong.
It doesn't look right to me.
Your reading's in three hours!
It Let's make some books!
I think I have some really good glue in my non-mobile craft cart.
- You're gonna help me?
- Yeah!
- Let's do it.
-  God, this glue works great!
Oh, it smells great, too!
- It really does.
-   Oh, I love the smell of new books!
-  - : Yeah, me, too.
Mmm!
New, new books.
New, new books!
Oh!
Can I tell you something?
I feel great right now.
I feel very good.
I feel very confident.
- I am ready for that read.
- I think you're gonna crush it.
I think I'll read the whole book in about two minutes.
Yeah.
Just get in there.
You'll  - What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- And people are gonna go nuts.
-  They're gonna be like, "Yes, yes, we love this book".
And they're gonna just buy every copy, and then you're gonna have to, like, print more.
- That's what's gonna happen.
- Does your hair always look like that?
Yeah.
Do you have brown hair?
- Definitely.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- It's a secret.
-   Check this out.
I'm gonna birth this book.
-  -  - Here you go.
It's a baby book.
- Oh!
Congratulations!
- It's a paperback!
- Hey, guys.
- Reagan!
- Reagan!
- Reagan.
- Reagan!
Sorry that took so long.
I got stuck behind this, uh, lady at the craft store that was buying 700 individually-priced buttons.
- Mm.
- Oh, they said to say hi to you.
- Hi.
- And I got you a new shirt, Nick.
Oh, isn't that nice.
Phew!
What the hell is that smell, you guys?
- We made a library!
- Mm.
Is this the glue?
It comes from my private collection.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's very strong.
You guys are so high.
- How dare you?
- How dare you?
- I'm not high at all.
- You're high.
Whoa!
You guys, this says to use this in an open field.
It specifically says that a backyard is too small.
- You're a backyard.
- Very good.
- I think I should cancel this reading.
- No way!
I am in.
I feel great for the reading.
Let me just buckle up my shirt.
Well, the problem with this author shirt is that it's made of honey.
- It's not - This shirt is too sticky.
- It's because there's glue on your - 'Cause it's made of honey, so I'm canceling.
You cannot do a reading in this condition.
No!
Don't cancel the reading!
You worked so hard to get it!
I got a backpack full of Pepperwoods, and I'm ready.
-  Oh!
-  Aah!
Jess, I'm coming!
Reagan, call shotgun.
-  - Are you pulling?
- I can't feel you pulling.
- Let me get your legs!
- Please don't drag her.
-  : Winston, where are you?
We are freaking out in increasingly weird ways.
I'm at a costume shop, getting ready for the big proposal.
A costume shop?
All in good time.
Now, listen, when I text you, I need you to bring Aly to Malibu, okay?
I don't want the two of us to drive back separately.
Plus, I want to make out at red lights.
Okay, Winston.
Just how much longer?
This is very important to me.
If you mess this up, you ruin my life, okay?
- No, Winston.
Uh, uh - Okay, bye!
No.
No, no, no.
Uh Ooh!
So many marital problems we have.
My baby's got a real sweet tooth.
Just the other day, she ate an entire sleeve of pecan sandies and punched the top right off - of a parking meter.
-  It was the craziest thing I've ever seen.
She yells at me constantly and there's one time where she tipped over a table.
He gambled away another paycheck.
Oh, no!
It's the ponies.
I'm addicted.
- Right, right, right.
-  It's true.
All the money that he wins on gambling, - he puts up his nose.
- Oh.
It's cocaine now, as well.
- Love me the ca-caine.
- Ah, yeah.
Feel invisible when I do it.
This feels like some sort of weird foreplay.
- I'm out of here.
- Wait.
No.
Aly, please.
Um Don't leave me with this rage monster.
Oh, yeah.
You I mean, you want to see a rage monster?
You want me to show her the rage monster?
- Well, here you go.
- No!
- Just - Gosh darn.
tipping tables!
- All right, that's - Wait.
Aly, Aly.
- Uh, but I just - Please don't leave.
- She belongs in a mental hospital!
- What?
!
I know what's happening.
You guys are trying to distract me from some weird thing Winston's planning.
Uh, no.
Aly, no.
Possibly a prank?
Might be a zotz, a goof.
If it's prank, please tell him I wore bad underwear today.
Please.
- Frank Sinatra strikes again.
- It's a prank, it's a prank.
That's exactly what it is.
It's a prank.
Great.
Oh.
Winston.
Stranded in Malibu.
All right, let's get this over with.
- Winston.
- Hmm.
Yep.
The good news is I'm feeling sober.
The bad news is maybe I'm too sober.
- Yeah.
I'm sobered up, too.
- Great.
Why are my eyes so good?
I can read everything from here.
What does that mean?
Oh, my God.
A secret world.
Okay.
I don't think she's sober at all.
Okay.
Hi.
Thank you for supporting your local bookstore.
Quick reminder: we're dying.
Please buy things.
I was feeling very confident before, but I'm losing some of it, so I think might just take one more quick pull.
- No, no.
No, no, no.
- Just one more quick pull.
- Just one more quick.
- Oh, my goodness.
Is this gonna be a problem?
Get it together.
And now, please welcome Nick Miller, author of The Pepperwood Chronicles.
- : No, no.
-  - Go ahead - Nick.
Go ahead.
They called What a wonderful day.
Quick reminder: we are dying.
I wrote this, every word.
All of that.
My hard work, not yours.
It's not a competition.
If everybody could stop looking at me, that'd be really great.
If you guys wouldn't mind just closing your eyes, as if you were at some sort of a show where you were asked to close your eyes.
- What?
- Thank you.
Do you mind looking down, sir?
: Nick.
All of these are for sale.
What's that?
Yeah coming.
Is that it?
Um  Don't worry about me, I live here now.
All right, what are we gonna do?
What's the plan?
Well, it helps if you feed him something first.
Do you have any meat?
Or nuts?
Why would I have come to the bookstore with meat and nuts in my purse?
- Okay.
Caramels.
- I don't have that.
All right.
Just tell him you believe in him, and that he can do this.
Yeah.
I'm not good at this.
Obviously.
So what would you say, Jess, if you were me?
I would say  Nick, you're one of the most amazing people I've ever met.
Everyone here is lucky to hear your book, because it's a part of you.
And if you fail, it doesn't change how special you are.
And no matter what happens here, I'll always love you.
Or something like that.
That made me tear up a little bit.
- I'm gonna use that.
- Okay.
Hi, Nick.
What are you doing?
I'm just hanging out in here.
I'm just taking a break.
Just, just having a moment yeah.
Hey.
No.
You are you are amazing.
And you, you're, you're, uh, special boy.
Like, uh, um you know, you like, uh, you're, you are very special, you know what I'm saying.
Uh, and let me start over.
Nick.
I believe in you.
Hey, this thing's awesome.
Did that guy write this?
Yeah.
He sure did.
There's a sadness about him.
I know what you mean.
Oh, there's movement.
Sorry about that.
Uh, that was some weird stuff.
"The sun baked down on Pepperwood's back "as he moved over to the St. Charles streetcar.
"The driver handed him a brown paper sack.
"Without opening it, Pepperwood knew what was inside: "blood-soaked beignets".
He is so dreamy.
Oh, your life's gonna be so hard.
Okay, Bishop, what is happening?
- Do you really need a spare?
- Oh, I got a spare.
A spare cactus.
Oh, my God.
I planted it in this spot that is perfect.
You see, the cactus is common, but the company is not.
- Hello, beautiful.
- It's perfect.
Come on.
We should probably just give them their privacy.
Yeah, you're right, you're right.
- Holy hell.
He's doing it.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- He's on a knee, here we go.
- It's happening.
- Game time.
It's a shoelace.
False alarm.
Okay, now here it is.
Here it is.
It's happening.
That is a ring.
I don't think that's a ring.
Is he giving her a gummy vitamin?
Okay, this is it, this is it.
And the other shoe?
That's why I double knot his laces.
You know what?
Let's stop asking questions.
Who knows?
- It's their date.
It's their date.
- What is this?
Hey.
You guys can take off now.
Of course.
You want to be alone for when you pop the question.
- Got it.
- Wait.
What?
We're so excited for the both of you.
Oh.
Oh, you thought I was gonna propose today?
No.
Yo, that's hilarious.
What do you mean it's not today?
No.
This is just phase one of 20.
- What?
- What?
Yeah.
We went through all of this for a non-proposal cactus picnic?
Damn it, Winston.
My girl deserves the grandest proposal ever, okay?
And that cannot be rushed.
- That is actually sweet.
- That's not sweet.
I te Here's a phase for you: When I throw you off the cliff into the ocean.
- Okay.
- Hey, look, don't worry.
For the next 20 weeks, I've only got you helping out with odd-numbered phases, okay?
And there will be sub-phases, obviously.
I ain't doing no sub-phases.
Think of them as annoyingly elaborate smaller phases.
He's really pushing his limits right now.
Thank you so much for your help.
One phase down.
- Boop.
- Don't boop him.
Just one.
I wish we sold just one.
Hey.
You did great.
Nick.
I'd like to introduce you to your number one fan.
Hey.
I really enjoyed what you read, and hearing it and how the characters were good, and how your face looks, - and I want to hold it - All right.
Keep it cool, keep it cool.
I think Mariah would like to buy a copy of the book.
- You want to buy one?
- Yes.
How much ya got?
A dollar.
Well, the purchase price is $12.95, so - I'm comfortable with the dollar.
- Okay, fine.
A dollar's fine.
Good deal.
The signature's free with the dollar.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Don't read it all in one place.
- You okay, Nick?
- Yeah.
Just concerned about - The shed scene.
- the shed scene.
But I don't remember the shed scene.
You don't remember the shed scene?
I don't remember it.
It's an incredibly graphic sexual scene.
- That's not good.
- Disgustingly sexual.
Who cares?
- My first sale.
-  Congratulations.
-  I did it.
-  Yeah, Nick!
Yeah, me!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
1 Valentine's Day!
-  Woo-hoo!
- Yeah!
Oh!
- Down, down, do your dance - Go left.
- Do your dance - We got a brand-new dance Down, down, do your dance Do your dance  - Oh, hey, what you doing?
- Hey!
Oh!
- We wasn't doing nothing!
- I love the "Cupid Shuffle".
- Why'd you stop?
- 'Cause, uh This particular day Yeah, it's, like, romantic in nature.
Ugh, that stupid "sad single girl on Valentine's Day" clichÃ©?
Do better.
I have a great day planned.
I'm finally gonna use the celebrity chef dinner that I won at the auction.
And before that, I'm gonna clean out my purse.
Dinner by yourself - and cleaning out your purse?
- Does that sound sad?
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.
Oh, kiss it.
It's gonna be great.
Hey, is there anything in there from Reagan?
She's in Minnesota, and we're exchanging gifts.
Gonna do the old stand-by, like when we were dating?
A nudie card with a $20 stapled to it?
I did so good.
No, no, no, I'm-I'm putting a real effort this year.
I feel five feet tall.
You're more than five feet right now.
I feel smaller because I'm humbled.
I'm humbled by my actions of tenderness.
Well, the only Valentine in this pile is for yours truly.
Someone very crafty made it.
She sent a Valentine's to herself.
Now, you understand this is sad, this is really sad.
Guys, would a sad person do this?
Down, down, do your dance, do your dance, do your dance Down, down, do your dance Do your dance, do your dance Down, down, do your dance Whew!
Say what you want, that woman can shuffle.
Mm!
Can't believe that we're not spending Valentine's Day together.
I know.
It sucks.
The first year that I haven't planned our bone-iversary.
I think I'd prefer to call it the anniversary of the first night we made love.
Either way, it's our first one as a married couple.
You know, we miss this, the next thing you know, we're making love once a year next to a Thomas Kinkade painting after a hot dog dinner.
It's not your fault, all right?
You've just been working so hard.
I've been killing myself trying to impress Kim.
Call the tween footwear people.
Here's their number.
Don't trouble yourself.
I've got it memorized.
You just dialed 17 numbers.
- Loretta, I need you!
- Freakin' Loretta!
Kim will take you seriously when she sees you in that fine-ass suit.
- Ah, thank you.
-  How long have we been waiting for this elevator?
What, are we in the lobby of Sterling Cooper?
Hey, hey.
What you doing?
Cleaning out your purse?
Fun.
Mind if I watch?
- Knock yourself out.
-  Whoo!
What you got there?
Is that a nail clipper?
What you gonna do with that?
Keep, throw away.
Keep, throw away.
I'm going with keep, I'm going Oh!
She's keeping it!
Oh, I get it you think I'm sad.
Aren't you supposed to be with your girlfriend right now?
Aly's not big on V-Day.
- What?
- Yeah.
She says it makes her want to eat and successfully pass a nail.
Yeah.
I love her so much.
And aren't you gonna propose to her?
Yeah, I am, in due time.
But right now, I'm only on phase six of my 21-step proposal plan.
I'm months away.
And in case you were wondering if I'm under budget, I am not by thousands of dollars.
Winston, no matter what Aly says, all girls love Valentine's Day.
Get your cupcake ass out of here and go make her feel special.
I can't miss this.
Leave me to my froyo cards.
God, I got to start going to the same place, you know.
Or else I'll never get a free one.
Oh.
I'm alone.
I can't even imagine what Reagan got me.
'Cause I know she went, you know, at least as hard as I went, and I got to say, I went hard.
At 11:00, an 11-ounce steak - will be sent to her room.
- That's large.
At 12:00, a single rose will arrive.
At 1:00, the hotel manager is gonna come, he's gonna tell her there's a problem with her room, he's gonna take her to another room.
When she walks in that room, boom, it's filled with roses.
- Damn, son.
- It's a slightly worse room, but it's right near an ice machine.
I am proud of you.
You're a real Big Boy Cupid.
Big Boy Cupid I like that.
- Say it again.
- Big Boy Cupid!
I didn't like it that much that time.
Well, I'm very happy for you on your Valentine's Day.
Doesn't really feel like Valentine's Day to me.
Schmidt didn't get to plan our bone-iversary this year.
If he is too busy to plan the bone-iversary, then you've got to do it.
Okay.
Sure, I guess I could step up my game.
- Right?
Good.
- Right, yeah.
Okay, I'll try it, I'll do it.
That is some good advice.
Now my final bit of advice, and don't get sensitive on this, but you got to change that top it's terrible.
And you got to throw sparkles on.
- I think - Sparkles are in.
- I think my top is fine.
- Sparkles - are in!
- There's a line.
- You giving me fashion advice - Sparkles - is the line.
- are in!
-  - Look, I know it's not much, but, um, you know, I just thought it would be nice to spend some koala-ty time together.
Ew.
- : G'Day, mate.
- Oh, no.
What's a fit Sheila like you doing with this sticky joey?
You were right.
I said I didn't want to do anything today, but this is pretty fun.
: Even though you forgot the Parmesan cheese.
Well, that's not what he would sound like.
I mean, if you're gonna say it, you might as well say it the way he would  I can't even joke be mad at you, because you're so perfect.
Well, you're the most ridiculous person I've ever met.
-  - But, you know, I honestly never get tired of you.
Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but I don't even care, I'm just gonna say it.
Why don't we get married?
Nah -  - You said no?
I have a proposal plan, okay?
A plan.
You know what, and I would not be in this mess if it wasn't for you convincing me to do Valentine's Day in the first place!
I'm sorry, I'm just You know what, I'll just find her at work, okay?
And I'll-I'll tell her yes then.
- I'm used to compromising my dreams.
- No, Winston, you deserve an amazing engagement.
You're America's sweetheart, and you have to give Aly the proposal she deserves.
And you have to do it today, 'cause she's probably freaking out right now.
It's a 21-step plan.
I can't do it in one night.
You can't, but we can.
Jess, I can't make you do that.
I mean, you had a whole day planned.
I mean, it's a day I maintain was rooted in sadness.
You say I'm sad one more time, and I'm gonna take you to San Francisco, and we're gonna eat a little sourdough, maybe a little crab, and then I'm gonna throw you off the Golden Gate Bridge!
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.
Now, you go tell that son of a bitch cat of yours that he's gonna get a new mommy, 'cause we're gonna propose tonight!
Okay.
Okay, let's cut this 21-stage plan down to the essentials.
- Okay.
- Great binder, by the way.
- You get it at Captain Work?
- You know it.
- Downtown or Third Street?
- Downtown.
Good.
Third Street's for idiots.
I'm really loving your vibe right now.
You're really taking control.
Yeah.
Uh, okay, Malibu cactus picnic.
Did that.
Erotic skywriting.
That's a cut.
Mm.
See, I'm not sure if you understood - I know what erotic skywriting is.
- It's in the sky.
Special performance by the L.A. Children's Choir?
They're gonna come out all cute and small, singing "Alison".
- We're cutting.
- Huh?
Okay, we can't get your ring in Atlanta.
It's the most affordable big city in America, so Well, I have a local ring guy, - so it's Cut-lanta.
-  Operation Bobcat?
- Let's call that "Operation Cut Cat".
- No, no, no, no.
Oh, I should have said "Bob Cut".
- Next time.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Move your hand.
Don't rip that.
When Aly and I were first partners, we got called to break up a drug deal in a bus station bathroom.
When we got there, wasn't nobody in there.
Just a bobcat.
Like, a bobcat running around.
I shrieked.
Of course, I was afraid for my life.
But Aly she, she just laughed.
Laughed and laughed and laughed.
And, you know, it was that moment that made me realize I wanted to make her laugh for the rest of her life.
And so, the plan was to recreate that moment.
So You already have a bobcat costume, don't you?
I'm an oddball romantic.
You bought a bobcat costume before you got a ring?
You really toe the line between sweetness and insanity.
That's the whole thing.
I already e-mailed you the reports, but I know you love hard copies, and I love that about you.
- Why?
- Why?
All right.
Happy bone-iver So, actually, I'm going to, uh, double-check those hard copies, and I'm gonna bring them to you, 'cause I want to make sure that they're ready for your brilliant eyes.
Cece, what the hell are you doing in here?
- Surprise!
-  - Cece, I love where your head's at.
- Mm-hmm.
And I love where your body is at even more, but I-I can't.
What if I told you that I have the Star of David hidden somewhere on my body, - and you have to find it?
- Okay.
Okay.
All right, let's do it.
But we got to do it really quick.
I'm gonna stay dressed and just poke out like a cuckoo clock.
Not here.
I got a whole thing planned.
Happy bone-iversary.
Who would have thought the first moment that we ever were intimate with each other, you know?
Honey, we're on the clock here, and it's getting very cold, so why don't we get this car started.
-  -  - Oh!
No, no, no!
- Oh!
Oh!
- What?
!
- My executive ensemble!
No, no, no!
Thank you for coming, Trevlo.
Hey, got to sell these rings.
Driving towards success.
We blessed.
You're always so positive, Trevlo.
Got to stay positive.
- Stay blessed.
- Stay blessed.
Yeah, blessings.
: Blessings raining down on you.
Oh.
I think, we got one, Trevlo!
$12,000?
You out of your damn mind, man?
- No, no, no.
- You got to work with me, Trevlo.
Can't do it, baby.
Come on, Jess, you told me this dude was your friend.
Friend is a stretch.
I rear-ended him in a drive-thru, and he gave me his card.
Blessings.
- What?
!
- What?
!
What the hell you do to my fade, Jess?
!
I said a soft blend!
Soft!
I think it looks great, baby.
It's all your perception.
I look like if LeBron James turned around.
- Calm down.
- Look, I'm trying to stay calm, Jess, but I'm trying to fit a 21-step plan - into three hours.
- Stay blessed.
I swear I'm gonna shove one of those blessings right up Trevlo!
I thought that was you!
Wow, look at you.
Looking trim.
- Been counting my steps, baby.
- You know Trevlo, too?
Yeah, I was in the car when Jess hit him.
- Stay blessed.
- Stay blessed.
- Stay blessed.
- Everybody stay blessed.
- Stay blessed.
- Anyway, Schmidt's having a Valentine's Day emergency, and he called on Big Boy Cupid for help.
Cece's been calling me Big Boy Cupid because I'm super romantic now.
What can I say?
I'm in love.
Nick, you in love?
Tell me about her.
Is she positive?
She is not positive, but I can't wait to see what she got me for Valentine's Day.
You know what?
Can't do it.
The proposal is off.
- What?
!
- I feel like I'm being a bad friend - by putting you in this spot.
- What spot?
Jess, I saw your face when Nick said he was in love.
- Didn't have a face.
- Yes, you're sad.
I'm not sad.
Please, everyone, stop telling me I'm sad!
A proposal is the last thing that you should be doing.
- I'm calling it.
- Come on!
We don't have a ring, we're rushing through all the steps.
It's better this way.
I'll come up with a plan B, I'll make it up to her for Valentine's Day.
You got to take care of yourself.
I feel very, very happy.
Stay home, relax.
Have your meal with your private chef, and more than anything - stay blessed.
- Don't tell me to stay blessed.
You stay blessed!
Stay blessed!
You know, it's still our bone-iversary.
I'm too stressed.
Sex right now would be like picking a lock with a cold, wet French fry.
- Nick.
Nick!
- What?
- Nick!
Finally.
- Nick!
I couldn't see you.
This thing was blocking me.
Loretta's probably running the company by now.
- Get over here!
- Sorry I'm late.
There was a TV crew by the Staples Center, so I had to jump around behind the guy to get on TV, but the good news, I got on TV, so I think I'm gonna be on the news.
- Great.
- What do you got?
Here, I got this for you, man.
You got some pants.
- Got a suit jacket.
- You brought that suit?
!
It's a 62 short.
I wore that to college graduation.
It was in your closet!
As motivation!
Here you go, Cece.
It's a beautiful dress.
My wedding dress?
!
Ah, it's your wedding dress?
I knew it looked familiar.
- 'Cause you were at the wedding!
- You're a buffoon idiot.
Oh, my God, it's Kim.
It's Kim.
It's Kim.
Shh.
Shh, shh.
This is the start of a very long cry.
As a bartender, you really get to know the human cry.
So what else is going on with you guys?
So is it just you?
Yup.
You know I'm quite famous, and you didn't want anybody else to experience my food?
No.
Just me.
Just my day.
Are you sad 'cause you're on your own, - on Valentine's night?
- Ugh!
Don't you start with me, Gordon Ramsay!
I'm having just a great time.
Liar!
Sorry.
Bad habit.
- Just bring me the scallops, please.
- Impatient.
Mmm.
Delicious.
Scallops aren't  for liars.
- Why are you sad?
- I'm not sad.
- Then what are you?
- I'm mad!
There it is.
I'm mad that Nick just decided to be a great boyfriend.
Where does all this effort come from?
Reagan gets Mr. Cupid, and I got, like, some nudie card.
This bread is incredible.
- You taste the crust?
- It's really good.
And you know what else pisses me off?
The fact that everyone thinks I'm sad.
I mean, Winston canceled his engagement 'cause of it.
Then bloody do something about it!
Brilliant!
Uh, just a reminder: I'm not required to clean up.
Winston can't throw away his dreams because of me!
Then don't let him.
Hey, Jess, what's up?
Winston, I'm not sad.
I'm mad!
Bloody brilliant.
Okay.
Cool.
Thanks for the call.
I'm not letting you throw away your dreams, okay?
You're proposing in that bus station bathroom, and I am going to help you.
I'll meet you there in one hour, and I'm bringing the bobcat suit.
Bobcat suit?
Thank God, because my plan B was weak!
: I'm the man.
Okay, she's not looking.
Come on, let's go.
- We can go now, we can go.
- No, don't move.
If we move, we I'm-I'm fired.
She's not gonna get off this roof.
- I know how to handle this.
- Are you out of your mind?
You're just gonna materialize out of thin air on a rooftop?
Easy.
I work here.
I'm a window washer, and I finally got to the top floor.
You don't like that one?
How about this one?
I'm a traffic guy, and I fell out of the news chopper.
- What are you talking about?
- All these work perfectly.
I'll just pick my favorite on the way over.
Sit down, you nincompoop.
This is completely my fault.
I just really wanted to do something big for you, because you do so many romantic things for me.
And I just wanted to find some way to show you how much I love you.
Instead, all I did was mess up your job.
- Cece.
- I'm sorry.
You mean more to me than any job ever will.
Screw it.
Screw what?
What?
I love Cece!
Oh, well, then I love Schmidt!
I love him.
- Love you.
- Love you.
Well, this is a productive use of time.
What the hell is going on, Schmidt?
And what is that guy doing?
I'm a chimney sweep.
- All these are clogged.
- A chim?
Clogged, clogged, clogged.
Are you crying?
That's the question.
Are you crying?
I just met my birth mother.
I don't have to explain myself to a chimney sweep.
Schmidt, why are you dressed like a Little Rascal?
The truth is it's - it's our bone-iversary.
-  Kim, this job means so much to me, but she means a lot more.
So if this costs me the promotion, then I can live with that.
You know, this is the first conversation we've ever had where you weren't lying to me.
It's nice.
I'm not flaming with rage.
And by the way, I've noticed you're working your ass off.
Now get back to work.
Cece, your dÃ©colletage looks beautiful.
Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah.
It cleans up pretty nice.
And this ring is perfect.
How did you get Trevlo to come down on the price?
I don't think it's a legitimate business, and that's the real answer.
- Anyway, I got it done.
-  Okay.
I called the station, they're sending Aly down - on a public disturbance call.
- Nice.
I'm nervous, but, you know, I'm really glad we are doing this, you know.
If I didn't propose in a public bathroom while wearing a bobcat costume, I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.
-  - Oh, here she comes.
- Uh, put your head on.
- Okay.
Oh, nice touch.
Police!
You have five seconds to pull your pants up.
Your bus is leaving.
Come on, man.
I'm having a really bad day.
-  -   Ah, that's a concussion.
Just a little bump, right?
What is going on?
Happy Valentine's Day.
What?
- Jess, why did you decorate a bathroom?
- Oh, boy.
Why is Winston dressed like a tiger?
He's dressed as a bobcat, but I got something I want to say.
When my head hit the wall, it knocked my eyes out of focus.
So I'm gonna need you to read it for me.
- Oh, my God.
Okay.
Um - I'm still a little woozy.
Aly, um, look at Winston, but listen to me.
Um, fellas!
Alison - What the hell?
- Winston wanted a kids choir, but this is all we could get on such short notice.
They're called Protect and Swerve.
Oh, Alison My aim is true - "Aly, I'm in love with you.
-  "I love your face, your mind and your butt".
Good opening, good opening.
"As a young black man, "I never thought I'd feel safe "with a police officer.
"When I met you, I threw away all my shoes, 'cause they made me feel like I was walking on air".
I'm not gonna get too sentimental Like those other sticky valentines Ooh-ooh "You're the most amazing woman I've ever met, "and I have something to ask you.
"But first, I'm gonna describe in vivid detail our first sexual encounter".
- Oh, don't do that.
- Okay, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna read - You know what we did.
- Yeah.
It's very long.
Here we go, okay.
Um "I have a complicated relationship with God".
- No.
- Okay.
Here we go, okay.
Um  "I don't think anyone on Earth "gets to feel as proud : as I do just to call you my partner".
That really got me.
: "And now I want to ask you to be my partner for the rest of my life".
You want to what you want now you want to what?
I'm not sad!
These are happy tears.
- Jess, I got this.
- What was that last Wh-what did she say?
Aly, the only reason I said no earlier is because I needed to show you how much I wanted to say yes.
I want you to be my partner for the rest of my life.
Oh, Alison Officer Nelson  will you marry me?
Of course I will, Officer Bishop.
My aim is true  - Come here.
-   What are we doing in here?
Well, I thought you'd like to see your husband's new office.
-  - I got the promotion.
She just told me.
Look at this place!
You've got a wet bar, you've got a thermostat.
And tickets to something called the Clippers.
You wanted to see me?
Actually, Loretta, I wanted you to see me in my new office.
That'll be all.
Thank you so much.
All right, Loretta, get out of here.
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.
Hey.
You got to come out here.
Winston's letting everyone try on the bobcat costume.
Oh.
I'll be, I'll be right out.
Uh, my Valentine's Day gift from Reagan finally came.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
She got me a necklace.
Did you want a necklace?
No.
Not really.
I don't know if I'm a necklace guy.
Well, some guys call it a chain.
- A chain?
- Yeah.
I call a chain the thing you put on tires in the snow.
- Oh.
- I got to say, I don't know what I expected from her, but it's definitely not this.
I'm sorry, Nick.
If it makes you feel any better, I spent the day cleaning blood off of a wall - in a bus station bathroom.
-  Well, Happy Valentine's Day, Jess.
Happy Valentine's Day, Miller.
To the happy couple.
Cheers.
- Oh.
- Come on.
Oh, he's still concussed.
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
To a beautiful engagement you probably won't remember.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
You haven't tasted a drop.
-  It won't go in.
-  Then stop doing it!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
1 Welcome, everyone, to Big Dinner, where the news is big, and the dinner is regular size.
Not to be confused with Big Supper, where we eat dinner and we watch the movie Big.
The movie about a grown woman - who has sex with a little boy?
- What?
- She didn't know.
-  Tonight we gather to celebrate Jess and I's final weekend inside the chrysalis of professional mediocrity before Monday, when we burst forth in fully pupated positions.
- Director of - Principal Day.
Non-Television, Non-Radio West Coast Marketing.
And Principal Day.
Sorry.
I should have waited till the end.
- What's "pupatated"?
-  Okay.
It's time for the rites of passage.
Ding, ding, ding.
I have some Big Dinner news of my own.
Winston, sit down!
The topics for Big Dinner have already been decided.
As you all know, Aly and I have recently become engaged.
I receive all that love, and then I give it right back.
- Anyway, as we were saying - I got to finish this.
It's really important.
In order to get married, I have commenced divorce proceedings - with my wife - Rhonda, yeah.
- Rhonda.
- Ding, ding, ding, ding.
Real quick.
I hate Rhonda.
: Hey, that's my wife!
- Such a good Harrison Ford.
- Who you married as a prank.
Which, for the record, no one gets.
-  Ding, ding, ding, ding.
- What the hell is going on here?
If everybody's jumping in, I'm gonna jump in.
Reagan says my room looks stupid, - like a teenager lives there.
- She's correct.
No one's authorized to ding, ding, ding except for Schmidt and I. And you you're not supposed to say "ding, ding, ding" - when you ding, ding, ding.
-  Guys, please.
These are all common topics.
This is why I proposed Common Lunch, - but nobody showed up.
- Don't yell at us 'cause you guys are freaking out about your new jobs.
I am not freaking out.
I have been preparing for this job ever since I was young enough to believe : leprechauns were real.
Leprechauns are real.
- Yeah, I caught one.
- He caught one.
We're not having the freaking leprechaun debate right now; - we'll be here for hours.
- Leprechauns are real.
Now, it's time for the rites of passage.
- Finally.
-  - Oh.
- Schmidt, I present to you new set of business cards.
- All right.
- So proud of you.
Okay.
That took a lot less time than I thought it would.
All right.
And now the donning of the principal's blazer.
Oh, the principal's blazer.
I remember when you got that ten years ago and promised you would never wear it till you were actually principal.
- Principal Day.
-  - You okay?
- I don't think it fits.
- No, no, you look great.
- Everything looks perfect to me.
- Looks great.
- Are you okay, honey?
I'm okay.
It's the middle of the night.
Yeah, just making a few, uh, minor adjustments.
Have you seen my scissors?
Never mind.
I have 32 seam rippers right here.
Are you okay?
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, Schmidt.
Can I get a second opinion on something?
Oh, about your room?
Reagan's right.
You need to redecorate.
It looks like you live in an abandoned day care.
: That is not what an abandoned day care looks like.
You can trust me.
Hello?
Can I take a nap now?
Okay, we need to talk about that a lot more later.
I'm worried about Jess.
I think she is freaking out about work and she's channeling all of it into her blazer.
She's got a real "cat in a bathtub" vibe.
Hey, guys!
I'm just blasting some Jock Jams, getting my fashion on!
What's the problem?
This is Jess at a six.
-  Sorry there, Jess.
-  Mm-hmm.
Nick here says you're freaking out.
What's going on, girl?
I am so good.
I am "saw" good.
I am so "gawd".
So "gawd".
We can't let her go to work on Monday like that.
Remember what I used to do for you in college when you'd get nervous about exams?
What did I do for you?
What was that thing called?
- Boy ride!
- Rumspringa!
- What?
- Rumspringa.
I said "Rumspringa".
- So did I. - No, you said "boy ride".
- No, I said "Rumspringa".
- What's a boy ride, dude?
Rumspringa, boy ride.
Boy ride saved my life.
I would be freaking out, and you would take me on these wild adventures.
Bio exam?
- Casino time.
-  Yeah.
Intro to environmental feminism?
- I remember.
- Corn maze.
That was the day we found out that corn is maize.
Do we take Jess on a little Rumspringa?
Can you just give me, like, a five-minute warning before Rhonda gets here?
I'd like to be not here.
Look, Rhonda shows up when Rhonda shows up.
I know.
That's the problem.
There's nothing I hate more than women talking about their rings in a high-pitched voice, : but, oh, my God, I love my ring so much!
- I love it!
- Aw.
I love that ring on your finger.
I just want to bite it off and swallow it, and then digest it properly.
And then give it back to you in a day and a half.
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna cry.
You guys have such a weird dynamic.
-  -  Hello, Winston.
Hey, Rhonda.
You wanted to sign the divorce papers, and-and I thought this was this was a good a time as any.
But I know it's a shock, but meet your son.
Oh, my God.
Um  Now, you listen to me, baby.
My father walked out on me, and I swear I will never do that to you.
That's so sweet.
: You just got Rhonda'd.
Rhonda'd.
-  -  - No - Oh, my God!
Did you just prank me with a baby?
: A human baby.
What the hell?
That is amazing!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I can feel my heartbeat through the back of my head!
You just took years off my life!
You are the master!
Where'd that baby come from?
- Oh, he came from Dave.
- Who's Dave?
Hi-yo!
Dave, take a bow.
Thank you.
Uh, thank you.
This is my cousin.
I'm staying with him while I'm in town.
So he's your baby?
: Oh, no.
I'm an obstetrician.
I just borrowed this little guy.
Rhonda, I'm Aly, Winston's fiancÃ©e.
It's so nice to meet you, I think.
All of us are coming down from this a little too quickly, 'cause what that guy did is a felony.
Congrats on your engagement.
-  Thank you.
- No one cares.
But you can't do it without these.
Thank God.
They 'bout to be "soined"!
The end to one of my best pranks.
- Oh, this feels good.
- Yeah.
That's it.
- That's it.
- All right.
Well, I better go.
I really hope you two are happy.
No prank.
So until we cross paths again A-ba-da-ba, ba-da-ba.
- Rhonda!
-  Rhonda.
- She's a lot.
- Understatement of the year.
She is, but, you know, the good news is, is we never, ever have to see her again.
Son of a bi She used disappearing ink.
What?
Girl pranked us.
I'm not doing anything!
-  Uh - I'm going to bed soon!
- Okay.
- I also know that my jacket has three sleeves.
Wait a minute, when did I add a fourth sleeve?
Did you guys see me add a fourth arm?
!
- Why am I freaking out?
!
- First day jitters, Jess.
It's totally normal, and we have the answer.
- Rumspringa.
- Boy ride.
Rumspringa is a hallowed Amish tradition, not a one-day buddy comedy.
Second of all, I don't want to go to a casino or a sexual petting zoo.
That is why we are taking you to the old-timey Danish town oddly located in California's wine country.
- Solvang!
- Solvang!
It's a craft fair!
You love craft fairs.
Candy apples, windmills, no minorities.
Great Rumspringa, guys!
I'm gonna hit the road.
I need to work on my blazer.
Well, I paid for all-day parking, so you're out of your mind if you think we're leaving now.
Jess, resistance is the classic first stage.
Just enjoy this!
It's so cool.
Look at this sign.
Look at this sign.
"When did it become a crime to rhyme all the time"?
So true.
And it's really funny.
Somebody just thought of that.
Do you think a teenager would hang this on his wall?
- No.
- I don't either.
I just got a vision for my room.
Excuse me.
Okay, I got to go home, and I got to work on my morning announcement voice.
: "My morning announcement voice".
: "My morning announcement voice".
I think the last one was close.
I really think you're overthinking this.
Just do what I do exude confidence all the time.
But you're the boss now.
You you can't skate by on confidence alone.
- Who says I can't?
- Well, I couldn't get away with it.
I'd always be worried that someone would figure out I didn't know what I was doing.
I'd be terrified as hell.
Nah.
I'm good.
- I'm so good.
- Well, I'm not.
I have to go home and work on my blazer.
- So I found a bus ticket back - Well, hold on.
I think there's somebody that you would like to meet, Jess.
Greetings, yon settlers three!
Are there folksy, old-timey reenactors here?
'Cause that would be, like, a total freaking game changer.
I am one of the founders of this town of Solvang, Professor P.P. Hornsyld.
Is this really what you're into?
And so begins phase two, enjoyment.
- At your service.
- I have 87 questions for you.
When were you born?
When did you die?
Where were you born?
Where did you die?
Are you a spirit?
What do you think of the modern era?
What do you think of technology?
Perhaps you'd like to try some aquavit, a traditional drink from the motherland.
Perhaps you will enjoy its humors more than you enjoy peppering me with this endless barrage of questions.
-  -   I can't believe you fell for the disappearing ink trick!
Ah, ha, ha!
That was Rhonda, that was Rhonda.
Rhonda?
Grow up, stop acting like Dennis the freaking Menace, and sign the papers.
The pranks stop right now.
- I just wish I could've seen your face.
- You are being a turd.
Aly hates pranks.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Like a normal person.
- No disrespect, Aly, but that's basic.
- Okay.
- That's very disrespectful.
Winston, I'm worried about you marrying her.
Here's a prank.
I'm, I'm gon - I'm gonna kick you in the head.
- See, that's not a prank.
See?
- Winston, I'm worried.
- Stop being a turd!
Now we're never getting a divorce!
- You're a crazy person.
- It's just gonna be pranks for life!
- What?
- Pranks at 50, pranks at 60, - Aly, ignore her.
- pranks at 80.
- Pranks in the nursing home.
- We'll figure something out.
Hey, you're small.
- What?
- I'm looking for somebody small for a prank I'm cooking up.
Actually, I could use all of you.
Okay, look.
Rhonda, yeah.
This won't work.
Aly, you don't have to do this.
If you do this for me, I'll give you your divorce.
If this is what I have to do to marry you, then Rhonda, the three of us will do your prank.
Wait, what?
I have in no way consented to this.
Gonna do a group Rhonda!
That's awesome.
Uh, how do you feel about having a bunch of jelly on your head?
Not good, Rhonda.
- Hey, Jess.
- Mm.
- Could you make a pillow out of this?
- You know damn well I could make a pillow out of anything.
Definite buy, bro.
Aquavit me.
I'm thinking of making a throw pillow for my room.
Uh, teenagers don't have throw pillows, right?
Whoa.
Why you packing up?
It's only 4:30.
Yeah, it's Sunday.
Everything around here closes pretty early.
- Sundays.
- I'm just getting my rum sprung!
- Stinks.
- What am I gonna do, Nick?
- I don't - Nick, I don't think I'm ready for this new job.
I'm freaking out.
And there's not enough aebleskivers in this whole place to soothe me.
It's not over.
Give me a second.
Give me a second.
I think I know how to keep this party going just a little bit longer.
Welcome to the distillery.
I'm gonna, uh, make sure that, that's okay.
Oh, you know what?
It's, um, it's probably just an old-timey Danish door.
You just need to jiggle the, um, the dorhandtag.
Yeah.
I'm doing that.
Maybe there's another door.
- No, that's it.
- Are we trapped?
Wiggle the dorhandtag!
- It won't budge!
It's locked!
- I'll make a call!
- Oh, my God.
- And there's no service!
Let us out!
We have a big day tomorrow, we need to pupate.
They don't know what that means.
Say something more accessible.
- Help!
- They have Wi-Fi.
-  - But I don't know the password!
I'm on a real roller coaster of emotions right now.
Just slamming up and crashing down!
Come on, help us, Danes!
Unlike in World War II!
Yeah, I brought it up!
- Darn it!
- What are we gonna do?
We've been stuck in here for over an hour!
Okay, yes.
Our bodies are trapped in this cellar, but our minds can go anywhere.
We have to start new jobs tomorrow.
Don't you know who I am?
I'm the director of marketing for Associated Strategies!
Hey, Schmidt.
It seems like you might need a Rumspringa.
Want to go to a casino?
- Pick a number.
Any number, kiddo.
- What?
- Pick a number.
- I don't understand this - 23.
- That's wrong.
- Fun, though, huh?
- How am I wrong?
- Was it 19?
- It was He doesn't need a Rumspringa!
He needs to get out of this cellar.
I think you're looking at it wrong.
There's still so much fun to be had in here.
For example, in three minutes, a bird is gonna pop out of that clock.
- A bird?
- Just gonna pop its head out.
- Why wait?
- What do you mean, why -  - Son of a Look, there.
I got the bird.
Isn't this fun?
I told you I didn't want a Rumspringa.
This might've worked when you were 20, but we're adults now, and you can't handle adult problems by forgetting about them.
You're right.
Maybe I handle my problems like a child.
Maybe I decorate my room like a child.
I mean, I even undress like a child.
Do you think that's what Reagan was getting at about my room?
Yeah.
Do you think Reagan thinks I'm a child?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, now I'm freaking out!
And I'm usually the rock of this group.
Once you lose old Nicky Miller, the whole thing falls apart.
Aah.
Aah, okay.
-  She's gonna pop!
- How far apart are the contractions?
- Who's asking?
- I don't know.
Let's take a look.
Wah.
I'm a baby.
- Oh!
- I'm, I'm coming out.
- Uh-uh.
- I, I know.
I'm rattled, too.
You just got Rhonda'd!
That's for not coming to the family reunion.
I'm so sorry.
We got Rhonda'd.
Uh, Dave?
Hello.
I, for one, would like to say I'm sorry.
Did not want to participate in this at all.
You're crazy.
- You got me good!
- Oh, God.
W-what's happening?
My, my skin - it's burning.
- What?
What's going on?
- The goop, it's burning my skin.
- What?
Do something.
My skin's burning, you guys.
- What?
Baby, baby, you okay?
- What did you put on me?
What did you do to her, Rhonda?
!
- Ow!
- She didn't want the jelly, so I used a porcine birthing agent.
- What is that?
!
- I I Well, it's burning!
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so sorry.
- You're sorry?
!
- I You should be because, baby doll, you just got Aly'd.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ooh!
How you like that, Rhonda?
- Who's basic now?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!
Oh, my God, I thought you were about to die.
My heart - She good.
- I died.
How could you do something so amazing?
!
Just kind of thought of it on the spot.
Oh, now, not only will you get a divorce, you have my blessing.
Put your hands away.
Nobody's asking for it.
We don't need that.
Well it's 4:00 a.m. It's official.
I'm missing my first day as principal.
Got a fresh toilet for you guys.
- Ration them.
- Guys, don't give up hope.
Well, I'm fine being trapped.
I don't want to go to work.
Look, we're gonna get out of here, and when we do, I'm gonna start I'm gonna start growing up.
You have grown up, Nick.
I mean, you own a bar.
You wrote a novel.
I'm talking about really growing up.
There's still so much I want to do, like - I want to try cilantro.
-  You haven't tried cilantro?
I want to figure out what NASDAQ means.
You've never had salsa?
I want to not shimmy out of my pants.
Feels good being empty.
I'm sorry I kidnapped you, Jess.
I just hated to see you with first-day jitters.
What is wrong with me?
I've been preparing for this job my entire life.
I mean maybe this'll help.
A bottle of champagne.
A toast to the new principal, right?
Should we?
Is that a bottle of Krug Clos d'Camaret-du-sur Mer?
Yeah, it absolutely is a bottle of "Klus Clos de Saminaire".
Little known fact about the late '90s Krug Clos d'Camaret-sur-Mer.
According to my father, they have very strong wire around the cork.
Well, that anecdote's ready to go.
Uncork it, Nick.
Go, go, go.
Look at that.
It's like a key.
Almost exactly like a key.
- Uh-huh, yep.
-  Okay.
- I did it!
- Oh.
I didn't even need to prepare for it.
When Schmidt's back is up against the wall, Schmidt shows up because I have confidence and skill.
Yeah, yeah, finish your epiphany on the way.
- We got to go.
We got to go.
- Let's go to Ass Strat.
Okay, two more hours before morning announcements.
I think we can still make it if we take zero pee or snack breaks.
Don't worry, I have five toilets.
I'm still too drunk.
I can't drive.
All right, drunk check.
- Drunk.
- Drunk.
All: Crap!
I'm sure glad we exchanged numbers yesterday.
- Really worked out, huh?
- Yeah.
So, you guys can really get me on The Price Is Right.
- Ja.
- Drew is a good friend.
Road trip!
- Boy ride!
Boy ride!
- Boy ride!
- : Oh.
- Please, can we just go?
The divorce papers are finalized.
Good news.
There's no way this could be disappearing ink, right?
Well, I mean, the longest disappearing ink on record is only 42 minutes, so - no, we're good.
- Great.
I actually had a good time pranking Rhonda.
No, not you, too.
Please.
I mean it.
I think we can kind of get into this as a couple.
We'll prank, - have some sex - Mm prank people, have some more sex, pet the cat.
I'm okay with that life.
I don't understand how any human being could enjoy it.
Well, because we are pranks, don't you see?
- Huh?
- In the Bible, God created light and dark.
And then separated the heavens from the oceans.
Then created plants, then animals.
And the animals, they thought they had all this cool stuff to themselves, but then God pranked the animals with us.
And it was good.
- : That was so sexy.
- Mm-hmm.
- That was so sexy.
-  I know it was.
Mm-hmm.
You like that?
- I didn't know you knew all that.
- Mm-hmm.
Trick's on me, that's for sure.
What?
Why are there adoption papers in here?
- Hmm?
- What?
There are adoption papers in here.
What?
Let me see this.
Oh, holy hell, Rhonda adopted Aly - What?
- in Liberia.
In Liberia?
- No, no, this doesn't make any sense.
-  "Dear Aly, please accept "these divorce papers as an engagement gift "from Mom".
Ew.
She said "Mom"?
I mean, I guess that's a good prank.
You're my stepdad?
I'm so confused by what qualifies, I honestly can't weigh in.
I hate my Liberian mom.
- Come here.
- Okay, Winston.
- Uh-oh.
- Not now.
- That's so crazy.
Let's just - Winston.
- Okay.
- Not now.
We made it, - and I didn't puke in the car.
-  Can we offer you any money for the bus ride home?
- What about The Price Is Right?
- We lied.
We have no connection to The Price Is Right.
Nobody knows Drew.
He-he's a hermit.
You watched me call my mom.
How about $300 to get out of the car?
- It's a good deal.
- Shut up.
All right, as soon as you step out of this car, Jess, you're gonna be a principal.
It's holiday.
School's closed.
- Why are all the kids going in?
- Yeah.
If it's if the school is closed, why are all these little kids going in?
- I agree.
- No, I'm asking you.
We should just go.
What are you talking about, Jess?
It's Get out there, you're gonna be late.
Schmidt, can I get a a minute alone with Jess?
Would you please take the pee bottles with you?
Sure.
A grown man standing around a bunch of ten-year-olds, holding bottles of his own urine.
What could go wrong?
Well, I think I know what's going on with you, Jess.
I mean, you've always been on this path, and now that you're at the end of it, and you've reached the goal, you know, it's a little scary.
Yeah, it's pretty stupid, huh?
No, I don't think it's stupid.
And as a guy who has never had a path like that, I'm personally really excited to see what happens next.
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of this car and I'm gonna go be principal.
Oh.
I forgot my blazer.
Way ahead of you, Jess.
Oh.
But you were gonna make a pillow out of that.
Ah, it won't fit in my room.
It's not a good style for me.
-  - It looks great on you.
Thanks, it fits perfectly.
And, Nick, I I like your room the way it is.
It already has a style.
It's you.
Okay, get to class kids.
Only five minutes till morning announcements.
Go get 'em, Principal Day!
Morning announcements.
Morning announcements.
Nailed it.
Morning announcements.
Morning
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
1 I need it.
I have a big day at work today.
I need it more.
I have to bake muffins before work.
- What?
Why?
- 'Cause it's for my "Lunch With Your Princi-Pal" campaign.
See, being principal's great, but unlike being vice principal, now the buck stops with me.
I'm "the Man" now, and all the kids can just smell "the Man" all over me.
That sounded really weird.
All I'm saying is, suddenly I have no relationship with the kids.
I'm really counting on these muffins to humanize me.
I deserve that coffee.
I'm finally director of marketing at Ass Strat.
Today I get to hire an assistant.
I'm gonna be tough, but I won't be a screamer.
It's not constructive, it's rude.
- Ooh, coffee.
- Your pour that coffee down, you throw it or I'll pour your blood on the ground!
- You'll pour my blood on the ground?
- I'll knife you!
Look, I got a full day of writing ahead of me, and that requires a fourth cup of joe.
What else is my whiskey gonna swim in?
You're taking this too far.
You treat that heart of yours like a baseball-man's mitt.
Uh, hello, I am the one packing for our move today, so I will be having, uh, the coffee.
- I get the coffee!
- Enough is enough with this!
- What are you doing here, Winston?
!
- I get the coffee!
Enough!
You guys are tearing each other apart.
For what?
Coffee?
Come on, man, you already got that energy inside of you.
And that is the light of the Lord.
Man, this?
This ain't nothing but the devil's water.
- Nah, I'm just playing.
- Hey, Winston!
-  - Winston, that wasn't fair!
I'll knife you by the urinal, Winston!
Enough with the knifing.
Today's the day it all turns around.
- Hey.
- Sorr I'm sorry I hit you, Jess.
I didn't mean to.
I'm using magnetic words to break through my writer's block, and it's not working.
I've already folded all my shirts and masturbated six times, and I'm running out of things to do.
I'm just in a real bind.
You see, The Pepperwood Chronicles sold over 30 copies, Jess.
So, what, we're complaining about good things now?
It's just, my audience is gonna be clamoring for a sequel, and I can't leave those stevedores, those-those tugboat workers, those lighthouse keepers empty-handed.
You think that your audience is entirely made of, like Blue-collar nautical workers on the coastline of Maine.
I don't think that, Jess, I know that.
Okay, Nick, you're incredibly talented.
You can do this.
And you have the key, - and the key is simply -  Oh.
I have to go.
Simply what?
Jess, simply what?
!
-  -  All right.
What do we have here?
"Sentient feces".
Why is there a magnet that says "feces"?
All right.
Trust the process.
Ugh.
Thanks for helping me pack.
No problem.
This might be our last chance for a mess-around.
Don't you start with that last mess-around stuff.
- Don't you start.
- Don't start, 'cause then I'll start.
Look, I'm already starting.
Don't start.
- I didn't start this whole thing.
- I can't do it, okay?
Okay.
Okay, we agreed, let's just pack, okay?
Great.
- Furguson?
Where have you been?
- What?
Hi!
Huh?
When you leave the house, you take your cell phone with you.
Oh!
Oh, thank you so much for grabbing my cat.
Come on, Sweatshirt, there's still some sashimi left between my toes.
Uh, this here is, uh, Winston's cat, Furguson.
Sweatshirt walked through my door a year ago, and while he may come and go as he pleases, he loves Mommy and her little milkies.
Yes, he does.
- I'm his home.
- Oh, really?
So why do I have a photo of Furguson on my phone?
Oh, yeah?
Then why do I have a picture of Sweatshirt - on my sweatshirt?
- Oh, damn.
Furguson, you got you got two families, you dirty dog.
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I'm Winston.
This is Cece.
Name's Gil like the man's name, but for me.
Cornell.
Magna cum laude.
Two years of executive assistant experience.
Very nice.
Is this 24-pound linen stock?
- Uh, yeah, it is.
- Impressive.
Ken, do me a favor.
Will you, uh, untie your tie?
Uh, I can't, actually.
It's, um it's a clip-on.
I know.
Thanks so much, son.
See yourself out.
Next.
Hello, sir.
- Hello.
- My name is Jeremy.
Thank you.
Let me give you a scenario.
We land the Bronco Blue Jeans account and install Brett Favre as its face.
You receive a call from a nosy maÃ®tre d'.
It appears that Brett has been spotted at the Ritz-Carlton eating a salad, dressed in a tuxedo.
The paparazzi are on their way.
You rush in to alert me.
You find me dead.
What do you do?
I find a honky-tonk bar near the Ritz Carlton.
I leave a pair of perfectly broken-in Bronco Blue Jeans in Mr. Favre's size, as well as a grass-stained T-shirt on the floor of the bathroom.
I get on the phone, rent a tractor, drive it directly into the swimming pool of the Ritz-Carlton.
When the staff is distracted, I physically subdue Mr. Favre under the weight of my full body, look him in the eyes and tell him to repeat after me: "I got drunk playing football and remember nothing since.
"I would never knowingly wear a tuxedo, "drive a tractor into a swimming pool or eat a salad.
"And I would never knowingly "leave my Bronco Blue Jeans behind".
- And the maÃ®tre d'?
- I rented the tractor in his name.
The next call he'll be making will be from the police station.
Welcome to Ass Strat.
Muffin?
Muffin.
They're homemade.
- Blueberry.
- You're so funny!
Look out, principal's coming!
Bah.
Just kidding.
Muffin?
Are you calling me Muffin or offering me one?
Either way, no.
Okay.
Well, cool, cool, cool, cool.
I think Bayou Sue sent the letter Sorry, what did you say?
Sorry.
Are we in trouble?
No, I just Did you say Bayou Sue?
She's just a character in this book that we're obsessed with.
Yeah, Pepperwood Chronicles.
Anyway, you probably wouldn't know anything about it.
I put a couple copies in the library, and the librarian didn't think it'd go anywhere.
I can't wait to rub it in Esther's smug face.
- That's very flattering.
- Please come and talk to these girls.
They're obsessed with Pepperwood.
I don't have time for this.
I'm only on page two.
And page one is just a dedication to Winston.
Ugh.
Come on.
The kids used to love Vice Principal Jess, and now they won't have anything to do with Principal Jess.
It's like I'm living in my own damn adorable shadow.
Please?
You-you might get some ideas from your audience.
My audience is the men who built this great country.
Your students would never understand that Pepperwood's just a New Orleans story about a guy fighting with the alligator within.
Well, could you just do it for me?
Yeah, I'll..
I mean, I'll do it for you, Jess, sure.
Well, then why didn't you You know what, I'm happy with where we ended up, but you took me on a real spin around the block there.
So, as you can see here, I treat Furguson right.
- Mm-hmm.
-  Okay?
- Organic kitty litter.
- Mm-hmm.
I got the miniature piano, the tiny, tiny treadmill, and right over here is where we do couples yoga.
Fish nuggets?
Oh, well, that would explain his recent oily eliminations, which I document on the cloud.
You track his poop?
What, you just weigh his hairballs and clock out?
- I mean, I - Furguson is happy here, okay?
: Around people that actually cherish him.
- Don't you start, Cece.
- And who helped him become the cat that he is.
- Now ain't the time.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.
Now ain't the time.
- What's happening?
-  I'm trying, okay?
I've just got to breathe for a second.
Let me explain something to you, okay?
Furguson is my cat.
I found him first.
Well, you may have found Furguson, but Sweatshirt found me.
I see you want to play hardball here.
- How about this?
- Mm-hmm.
We settle things the way we do on the street.
- Mm-hmm.
- Catcall.
- What?
- We let Furguson decide.
- Oh, yeah.
- Fine.
We'll leave the decision in his paws.
Which are now incredibly strong, thanks to his new set of, uh, mini-dumbbells.
- You're welcome.
-  Ooh, ooh!
Okay, Pepper-heads!
Get ready for a memorable experience, which I hope you will recount at your weddings, which I will also be at, brought to you by your favorite principal-slash-friend, Jessica Day.
Please welcome your favorite author, Nick Miller!
-  - Yay!
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
All right, let's get this over with.
Uh, let's talk about the book you guys most certainly don't understand because it wasn't written for you or people your age.
Go ahead.
- The kissing.
- OMG, the romance.
- The make out scene at the levee.
- Oh, the romance.
Guys!
Pepperwood's about way more than just a romance.
It's it's, uh, it's about life, you know?
Race.
The sexualization of the American handgun.
- : Keep it clean.
- Okay.
It's a story about his ambiguous relationship with with justice.
But the romance is amazing.
It made me realize it doesn't matter if I'm straight or gay; I'm just me.
You got that from my book?
That's yeah.
That was positive.
Do you think that's because of the gay dog character?
- Yeah.
- What I really respect about that is it's never mentioned that he's a gay dog.
But you got that from the writing.
And that's pretty dope.
You write female desire so well.
- Thank you.
- That's okay to say, right?
Yah, Ramona.
I'm-I'm just like you.
I'm your princi-pal.
I'm your friend.
I like to just throw on my rollerblades, and just go out there and think.
Can I ask you guys about the scene - in the fish morgue?
- Oh, my God, - that was my favorite chapter.
- Mine, too.
- I read it, like, five times.
- Yeah, same!
- What?
- I stayed up all night.
It was such a good chapter.
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.
You're welcome.
Why'd you whisper it?
Jeremy, I'm just gonna go grab a coffee, - and then I will - Dark roast, soy creamer, 160 degrees.
- How was your lunch, sir?
- Disappointing.
Why don't you eat the homemade bucatini I brought for myself?
Well, thank you, Jeremy.
Um, you know, - I'm not getting e-mails on my -  I just got an e-mail on my phone.
It's from you.
"Subject: Your e-mail is now working".
All right.
Well, Jeremy, I'm just gonna go enjoy this bucatini and, uh, organize the Peterson account.
- I did it already.
- You did?
- Okay.
I guess I'll just - Enjoy your lunch.
Yeah.
So you're saying that Lady Diamante doesn't realize that it's Pepperwood's underwear for years later, like, 20 years later?
Maybe she never realizes.
Yes.
That's what I was gonna say, too.
We you and me, we're right here.
- All right.
-  Wow.
This is incredible.
I mean, so many great ideas here.
It feels like maybe The Pepperwood Chronicles could be, like, a whole series.
Well, I mean, it's called The Pepperwood Chronicles, so I assumed there'd be more than one.
Yeah, well, I can't thank you guys enough.
- All right, I'll see you at home.
- Home?
- You guys live together?
- Yeah, we're roommates.
Yeah.
This job doesn't pay very much, but it's very rewarding to hang out with cool people like you guys.
You guys are actually, like, friends?
You ready to get your mind really blown off?
We used to date.
-  - Oh, yeah.
- Like, a whole thing.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah, we were in love.
Everything, yeah.
For a while.
All right, I'll see you at home.
Yeah, it was crazy.
- See you, guys.
- Wow.
You went from kind of "meh" to sort of cool to totally the coolest ever.
I don't want to freak you out, but that really means a lot to me.
- All right, let's get to class.
- Let's get a picture with PJ.
- Uh, what?
PJ?
-  Yeah, Principal Jess.
Much as I'd love to foster your creativity, I think maybe Principal Jess or Principal Day Let's not even go to class.
Let's go to the drama room and dress up like old men.
- PJ don't care.
- Oh, PJ do care.
PJ do care.
I mean, your principal does care.
How about we write a report on Pepperwood?
You're hilarious.
Yeah.
You know I'm serious about the report.
Don't walk away from me.
Okay.
Well, walk away.
Just turn to the left.
Point me out to your friends.
Laugh a, laugh a little bit.
Okay.
Yeah.
Keep going.
All right, I've totally lost control.
Ugh!
Damn it!
- Nick, I have to get to school!
- I know.
So do I. I can't wait to pitch those girls my Pepperwood prequel.
It opens with a very graphic description of his birth.
- It's like a dark Look Who's Talking.
- No, no, no, no, Nick.
You're not coming back to school with me.
You made me look way too cool.
The girls told the whole school.
I've lost all my authority.
This is my office.
I got invited to that, too.
The girls asked me to deejay at their dance party.
They call me DJ PJ.
They love you.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Ah, it's a tricky balance.
I don't want to be the heavy, but I need them to listen.
Those girls have such good ideas.
I've got to put the genie back in the bottle.
-  - Ugh!
See, this is what I mean.
They added me to a text chain about who has the cutest butt in school.
- And?
- It's Nurse Mike.
- Interesting.
-  Oh, you know what?
If it's always gonna be empty, let's just fill it with goldfish.
- So dramatic.
-  Jeremy texted me and he left an ice coffee in the fridge.
It's like this guy's in my mind.
It's also like he's in our kitchen when we're sleeping.
Can I come help you pack?
Jeremy's done everything around here.
Actually, I'm not packing, I'm just, uh, - hanging out with Winston.
- I'm so bored, Cece.
Please.
I'm desperate.
Are you guys having one of those mess-downs?
I could come be part of that.
Sir, I believe the correct term is "mess-around".
Okay.
Jeremy, enough.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
That'll be all.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
-  Did you say something?
- Jer-Jeremy!
Enough!
Dear Lord.
You know, I wanted an assistant that was gonna anticipate my every need so I wouldn't have to yell, but now I'm yelling, because I have an assistant that's anticipating my every need, and I can't breathe!
Work isn't everything, man.
Just go meet yourself a girl.
Or a, or a man.
I don't know what you're into.
You're very hard to read sexually.
But please, Jeremy.
That'll be all.
- Thank you.
- Sorry, sir.
WINSTON and  Furguson.
Hey, boy.
- Sweatshirt.
Sweatshirt.
- Furgie.
- Whee!
- Ah, there we go.
Hey, remember all of the good times we had?
- So may good times.
- Huh?
What about one of those times we wore the same shirt?
-  Custom shirts.
-  Dad of the year.
- Dad of the year.
-  Come on, Sweatshirt.
Hey, what about the time that we geeked out on mayonnaise?
Or how 'bout when we drove to the airport and kissed, watching the planes take off.
- You did what?
- Remember that?
- She's moving.
She's moving closer.
- No, no, no.
If you're moving - then we get to come closer, too.
- Yeah.
We're coming closer, too.
Sweatshirt Hey, boy.
- Furguson.
-  - What?
- I don't know.
Someone has crab in their pocket.
- Oh, my God, that's insane.
- Yeah, time-out.
-  - That's totally crazy.
Excuse Okay how does Okay, just  - Cheater!
- Oh.
Okay, well, that is from a salad I had earlier, and it must've just fallen into my pocket.
Cece.
I can't believe you did this.
It's just  Okay.
This is gonna be our last mess-around before I leave, and I just don't want Furguson to leave you, too.
Just because you stop living together doesn't mean you stop caring about somebody.
Because caring that is the real mess-around.
Come on.
Winnie.
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie!
- Oh, my God.
-   He chose.
- Ha!
- Yeah.
- Ha-ha-ha, you see?
- Ha-oh!
- The crab claw didn't matter.
- Mm-mm.
Furgie chose.
Outta sight!
Come here, my man.
Ah!
Aw.
Well, I suppose what's done is done.
He's all yours.
Good-bye, Sweat  Good-bye, Furguson.
Yeah.
Do you guys think it's cool or weird if, uh, Pepperwood has a peg leg?
Where we at on that?
I'm afraid it might make him too vulnerable.
I just don't see it that way.
I think it makes All right.
No peg leg, I guess.
Excuse me!
There's an assembl Nick!
What the hell is going on here?
Oh, PJ in the house!
My office.
Now.
Oh, PJ's gonna bust somebody.
You're the most in trouble.
But they started it!
I didn't even do any Gah!
You had an unsupervised meeting with the students.
You're wearing home slippers - on school grounds.
-  Home slippers.
You parked in Janitor Margie's parking spot.
And, by the way, she pissed.
- And she ain't small.
- It's a dirt patch.
And you ladies, you skipped an assembly for Pepperwood!
What's the big deal, PJ?
Yeah, you're kind of being a bitch.
This is unacceptable.
I don't want to be your enemy, but I also don't need to be your friend.
So you guys don't get to write to your international pen pals for a month.
You've all lost your community garden privileges.
Two weeks' suspension from the freestyle poetry slam.
And I'm calling all of your parents.
Spread the word!
Principal Day is done messing around.
Now get out.
Oh, my God, they work fast.
When did they even take this picture?
Well, apart from the devil horns, it's a pretty good picture of you, Jess.
That's true.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you.
The truth is-is you are exactly who I was when I was your age.
I was hungry.
I was putting in 22 hours a day.
Once worked four days straight without water.
Wow.
And I just wish that somebody had taken me aside and told me that there was another way.
Would you have listened?
- Probably not.
- Then I won't either.
In fact, you're not even talking to Jeremy right now.
- Okay, well, then who am I talking to?
- The younger you telling you to take advantage of your new super cool assistant so you can get to the next floor and the next floor and the next floor, and the next floor and the next floor, - and now we're on top!
- And now we're on top!
I'm liking this side of you, Jeremy.
Yeah, let's stay hungry.
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna work on the McCormick presentation.
Now I actually am hungry.
Let's order some food.
Already done, sir.
Arigato.
All right, now.
Take it down a notch.
Yeah.
If you're here to complain about your punishment, save your breath.
My decision's final.
Actually, we were just wondering if we could sit down with you for a second.
- Sure.
- We're sorry about being so disrespectful, Principal Day.
Well, I appreciate that.
If anyone wants a muffin, I I have an extra one.
Here.
We got you a gift card to a coffee shop.
It's really close to your route to school.
Well, that's not necessary.
Th-Thank you.
That's  We know you have a lot of roommates, and some of them are brilliant authors working from home, creating great chronicles.
But they can make their own coffee.
Well, that feels oddly on the nose.
We have the upmost respect for you.
Sorry, did you just say "upmost"?
- Oh, that is good.
-  Nick!
I can't condone you making contact with my students.
- What?
- That said thanks for putting them up to it.
Jess, I don't know what you're talking about.
"Upmost"?
There's only one person I know that says "upmost".
- It's "utmost".
- "Utmost"?
- "Utmost".
-  Agree to disagree.
But the good news is my writer's block is gone, and that is thanks to you.
You always come through for me, Jess, to the upmost.
I assure you, it's "utmost".
- What's an "ut"?
- Come on, you're a writer.
It's "up".
Up to the most.
Not ut to the most.
I assure you.
- Okay, sweetie.
- You didn't come in here and say, "Thanks for putting them ut to it".
I would've laughed you out of here.
What is an "ut"?
!
Furguson is miserable.
So you're saying that this is a different emotion than we've seen for the past three years?
A father knows.
He misses Gil.
It'd be wrong for me to take away a piece of his heart.
I mean, I already took away his testicles.
Anyway,  let me just Proud of you.
You won't need the key I gave you.
And the door always gonna be open.
You're not gonna, like, leave the door open always, right?
He'll be back.
What the hell?
- Jeremy.
- Oh, my God.
He came back.
Come on.
What the hell is this man doing in our house?
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Jeremy.
I'm the executive assistant to your husband and my boss, Mr. Schmidt.
Oh, are you the one who called and asked me about my blood type?
He's very thorough.
Actually, he's going to need everyone's blood type.
- You're not getting my blood.
- That's super weird.
- Yeah.
- Oh, hell no.
I do have individual coffee orders.
You can tell which one's which based off the caricatures I drew on the cups.
That's you.
This is shockingly accurate.
And you've never met us.
- I mean, how did you do that?
- Nailed it.
- Very creepy.
- That's pretty good.
Is he ever gonna leave?
I don't think so.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
1 So I really want to ask what's in the box, but, uh, it'll ignite a whole Seven thing.
"What's in the box?
What's in the box"?
"Repeat, John Doe has the upper hand".
I have got to see this movie.
You guys make it sound so hilarious.
Anyway, my former boss, Principal Foster, survived a real dicey safari in Africa.
His takeaway was that material possessions mean nothing.
Including his collection of super fancy, old-ass wine.
The lions came at night.
That put everything in perspective.
Everything, dawg.
Ooh.
Jess, thank you.
This is perfect.
Cece and I are completely moved into Jaipur Aviv.
So tonight, we'll be doing it for the first time on our first night in our first house.
And I'm going to Aly's tonight.
Yeah.
Gonna be doing it for the 10,000th time on our 1,000th night in her 100th apartment?
You think Aly's lived in 100 apartments?
I hadn't, I hadn't crunched the numbers on it.
So, Reagan's out of town till tomorrow.
What are you and Nick gonna do tonight?
What makes you assume I'm hanging out with Nick?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing tonight?
: Picking out clothes for Nick.
What?
I can't hear you.
I'm helping Nick pick out an outfit.
I we have to nail down his look for SOCALYALCON 6.
Wow, SOCALYALCON 6.
Wow.
I can't believe it's been a whole year since the last Southern California Young Adult Literature Conference.
You're a 12-year-old girl.
You spent $35 to meet me.
Is this what you want me to look like?
I got two questions: uh, where'd I get $35 from, and also, can my name be Daphne?
And I read that authors should all have a strong look, so I found four authors with strong looks, and I combined them.
Tom Wolfe: white suit.
Hunter S. Thompson: yellow sunglasses.
David Foster Wallace: bandana.
Toni Morrison: The Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Here you go.
Well, that's perfect, Jess.
Well, it was easy.
You have very few clothing items in your closet.
Also, are those your tax returns?
And why are you drying beef?
Because I don't have a file cabinet, and because I couldn't eat all the meat in one night.
- Now - That's gross.
- how do I look?
- What you need is a navy blazer.
Do you have a navy blazer or just the pit boss special?
What kind of a man owns multiple blazers?
Ha!
There's so many places for sex!
: All right.
That makes it official.
Houses are way better than apartments.
Now that we're out of closets, watch out laundry room.
-  -  - Know what that sound is?
- Hmm?
That is the absence of Nick.
The lack of Winston.
- What was that?
- Someone's hitting our house.
It sounded like, like, a, like, knocking.
Yeah, but the-the door is that way.
Oh, my God, I totally forgot.
We have a back door.
Houses have a back door.
What kind of person comes to a back door?
- Jeremy.
- On behalf of the neighborhood, may I be the first to say, welcome, sir.
"A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy".
- I didn't know you lived nearby.
- I don't.
But I will someday.
Just as I will do everything that you have done.
That's the tone that we talked about, Jeremy.
No, thank you.
I can't wait to have a servants' entrance.
- Let's not call it that.
- Two points of entry.
Very well done, sir.
Cece, I just thought of another reason why houses are better than apartments.
- Now we can enjoy two points of entry!
-  No, thanks!
I'm talking about the doors.
I-I didn't mean  So a lion scares Jess's old boss in Nigeria, and we get so drunk we have sex on a dresser in America.
What a world.
- It's all connected, baby.
-  And the broken dresser, that's my fault.
I'm all haunch.
- I'll buy you a new one.
- You don't have to.
Because guess who has two dressers.
- Rip Torn.
- No.
Me.
I mean, you and Rip Torn.
Stop talking about Rip Torn.
- You have a backup dresser?
- Yeah.
Just when I thought you couldn't get any more perfect.
It's in my ugh, my storage unit.
I-I'll get it tomorrow.
A dresser's pretty big; I could help you.
That's okay.
I'll just get it tomorrow.
- I mean, my day is wide open - I said no!
: Okay.
"A Guide to Your New Neighborhood by Jeremy" is very comprehensive.
Yes, the fact that we're in between a raisin house and a toothbrush house, makes me feel very confident about Halloween.
Crime statistics?
We have crime?
Crime that warrants statistics?
Oh, my God.
It says there were 14 home invasions last year.
Up six percent from 2015?
Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
W-we're just gonna get worked up about nothing.
Right?
There are only two ways into this place, the front door and the back door and we've locked them both.
- We're good, we're good.
- We're good.
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah, no.
It's fine.
- Yeah.
We're fine.
- I just - Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
At the risk of sounding clichÃ©, should we have sex in the bedroom?
I think that's a great idea.
-  -  -  - The hell was that?
!
Are you the criminals?
!
From the statistics?
!
-  - Oh, what are you doing?
I almost hit you with this brushed steel modern lamp.
- Really?
- I am sorry we broke in, but I'm also pretty impressed with us.
What kind of taco meat you bitches have?
I told you, if we locked both the doors, our guests would know to come in through the windows.
Our ground floor windows.
You see?
What started out as snark has become a real eye-opener.
What did you want us to do?
Ring the bell and wake you guys up?
Oh, no.
Thank God you didn't wake us up.
See?
I told you they'd be cool.
Ask him.
You were right.
Schmidt, here's my question.
Apologies.
My author look is missing one thing Navy blue, medium weight, two button.
I know the blazer.
Nick, listen to me.
If you ever, ever need a blazer, I don't care how late it is, till the day I die, you wake me up.
Thanks.
Okay.
We're gonna have a conversation.
- I am a little concerned.
- I know.
What if the blazer doesn't fit?
No.
About you and Nick.
And about how you're being his girlfriend.
- You mean being his good friend.
- I mean being his girlfriend.
A good friend will maybe drive someone to the mall in the daytime so that they can buy a blazer.
They don't go on a giggly late night crime date so that they can steal one.
That's girlfriend stuff.
You've been doing a lot of girlfriend stuff lately.
"Godfather of Soul, blank Brown".
Five letters.
- Bubba.
- Okay.
Wait, you want to know who wins in a fight between Winston Bishop and Winston Churchill?
Hey, do you know what this book's about?
Bayou n-noir.
Uh, Pepperwood, he's a private investigator It's about a man who has nothing, who risks everything, to feel something.
Thank you.
None of that's girlfriend stuff.
That's all good friend stuff.
Okay, let me, uh, toss out a hypothetical to you, okay?
Nick has a piece of lint on his sleeve.
Do you go, "Hey, bud, you got some lint on your sleeve"?
Or do you pick it off?
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- Yes, you do.
Because you are a rabid watcher of The Crown.
- I watch a lot of shows.
- And so therefore, you know that picking lint off of a man's sleeve is the most intimate gesture.
I just leave it there.
A little piece of lint on his sleeve.
- I wouldn't do anything.
- What would you just want to Fine!
I'd want to pick it off with my bare hands!
Oh, my God.
I'm the girlfriend.
I'm so nervous for SOCALYALCON 6 that I lost my appetite.
But then I found my appetite, but now, now that I found my appetite, nothing sounds good.
Mm, sounds like you're in a complicated way, my man.
You know what actually does sound good?
The cake you made on the Fourth of July.
- Would you make it again?
- You want me to make a, uh, an American flag sheet cake in March?
Yes.
It'll be fun.
We'll do it together.
- You get to wear this.
- Okay.
My favorite apron.
You know what, no!
No, I'm not doing this anymore.
Anymore?
We've never made a cake together.
Wait, have we?
If we have, I don't remember.
I drink.
No, not no.
Not just this.
All of it.
All the girlfriend stuff.
It's not fair.
All right.
Sorry.
I-I didn't know you felt that way.
No.
I don't feel that way, I - But you said unfair.
- Yeah, I did.
I said that 'cause I if I feel it is unfair.
To Reagan.
She's your girlfriend, I'm your good friend.
She, you know, she should she should get to make you sheet cake.
Yeah, that makes sense.
I just need to make something clear between us.
If that's okay.
You're saying "sheet" like "ghost clothes," not like "in a toilet," right?
Whoa.
I taught English in Japan for a couple years after college and I fell in with a bad crowd.
It was a time in my life I'm not proud of.
I fell in with with a Japanese game show crowd.
Which one?
-  - This one?
This one or this one?
- I don't understand you!
-  Okay.
Oh, my God, I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
I was a ten-time top master champion on Protocol of Best Enjoyment.
- These are the spoils.
- Question is that hippo rideable?
Those day laborers were right.
This stuff is awesome.
Why was I so embarrassed for you to see it?
If this is your deep, dark, embarrassing secret, then I am worried for you to see what's buried in my storage unit.
I feel like I'm pretty up-to-date on your embarrassing secrets.
Oh, honey.
I have chapters in my life you know nothing about.
- Wait, really?
- Here we go.
I once sold knives door-to-door in high school.
And Byron Allen knocked me out.
Yeah, that was, like, the first thing you told me when we met.
Oh, yeah.
I do use that as an icebreaker, I forgot.
Well, here's one from deep in the storage unit.
Way in the back.
I once got my foot stuck in a go-kart.
- And I had to - Hop six laps alongside of it.
I've been kicked out of multiple focus groups for for crying too much.
That happened yesterday, and I was with you.
I fell asleep in study hall.
Had a very loud sex dream.
That happened to my family member, and I relayed the story to you.
- I fell asleep in a bathtub.
- Knew that.
And I once dislocated my thumb getting off a couch.
Okay, you got five more minutes on that hippo, and then we switch.
What was wrong with me?
Well  nothing in this picture.
Hello, gorgeous.
Crop and keep.
Reagan!
Hi.
How do you get off a plane and still look dewy as hell?
Uh, I made a deal with the devil some time ago.
- Hey, I'm the blue words.
- Too late.
We're going with it.
I picked you out Well, welcome back!
Sorry.
I don't know why I'm still shouting.
Um, so Nick told me about what's been going on with you two.
Oh, he did?
- Listen, Reagan - No, you listen to me.
The next time I find out that my man has been coming to you for cake I'm gonna take you out to dinner - to say thank you.
-  Because I hate baking.
Speaking of dinner, why wait?
Why don't we do that tonight?
About Nick, um Jess, you don't have to change your relationship with Nick because of me.
I'm not a jealous person.
But thank you for thinking of me.
That's very nice.
You're a really good friend.
And that is why I got you this gift.
Oh, expensive jewelry.
Classic friend gift.
Thank you, friend.
But I don't have anything for you.
Except this nice wink.
And here it comes.
And bam.
Oh, you're really tense.
Yeah, you don't have to do that.
My-my tension's what drives me.
- Oh, no, I want to.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't have a lot of friends that are girls.
- Mm.
- Oh, my God, I think you're my first girlfriend.
I'm sure you're missing someone, like, from high school or college.
Somebody?
A cousin?
That much is true  All 22 points of entry locked.
- Good night, babe.
- Good night.
- Mm.
- Exhausted.
I know.
I feel so safe.
- So, here's the thing.
-  - Devil woman!
- How are you doing that?
I just had a four-hour dinner with Reagan.
At which, we shared something called "The Lovers' Pork".
Cece, it's getting worse.
I'm both their girlfriends.
How did you get in here, Jess?
- Through the doggy door.
- There's a doggy door?
Well, it's flush with the people door, and it's painted shut, so I really had to put my head into it.
God, I don't want to be both their girlfriends.
Why do they both need me so much all of a sudden?
All of a sudden?
!
This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.
Even if nothing comes of it.
She came here to see you.
I bet you're reading into it.
What if I go talk to her?
So I fly you down, - you are my gift to Nick.
- I'm in.
Have you talked to Reagan about this?
I bet she'd be awesome to talk to.
Just tell him you believe in him and that he can do it.
Just go talk to Reagan.
So, work it out.
You know who you should talk to about this, because he could answer all your questions, is Nick.
- No.
No.
- Nick!
Oh, my God.
It's not all of a sudden.
- They've needed me all along.
- SCHMIDT and  Yeah.
- Am I the only reason they're together?
- SCHMIDT and  Yeah.
Am I the architect of my own nightmare?
Okay, no, no, no, no, honey.
It's not like you introduced them or something.
Well, they did just get together because she left for jury duty.
I've pushed those two together like a god on Mount Olympus, too cheap to pay for porn.
No, no, no, it's like their relationship is a flood that's about to happen and you're the little Dutch boy with your thumb in the dike.
Well, no more.
I'm taking my thumb out of them.
Is there anything other than Dutch boys or god porn?
I know, pandas.
I'm a zookeeper.
- They are my panda.
- What?
- What?
- Pandas wouldn't be alive without humans.
They can't run, they can't growl, they can't even mate without us.
Have you been helping Nick and Reagan mate?
In a way, yes.
But I'm done.
This zookeeper is through handing out bamboo.
Reagan and Nick deserve a chance to see if they can survive on their own.
Yes, and the zookeeper deserves a chance to be on a late night show with hilarious animals that poop on the host's - I don't what am I saying anymore?
- I don't know.
I don't even know.
Look, honey, you you deserve the right to do what's best for you.
Well  that, too.
I saw a lizard once, uh, making diarrhea on Johnny Carson.
You are number one supreme jumper!
Okay, I have, like, a million questions about what's going on here, but  You are bouncer of much success!
- Yeah, we are!
-  Could you guys stick around for a little bit?
- 'Cause I don't -  You soar higher - than osprey and crane!
- Yes!
I don't want to be alone with Nick and Reagan.
You are gravity's master!
He weeps at your feet.
Okay, sure, Jess.
We don't have to be at the station till till, uh  This just says we're ten days from a full moon.
Yeah, it's weird, I can't get mine out of scuba mode.
- I don't know how to read this.
- It's 11:45.
- What?
!
- What?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
Farewell, emperors of trampoline.
Look, sorry, Jess, but we got to be at the station in less than 15 minutes.
Oh!
I just figured out something that you definitely do not know.
I blew my nose once and a bug came out.
We were all there when that happened.
That was at my birthday brunch.
Hey, Jess!
Oh, hey, guys.
I can't talk; I have so much paper to fold.
Well, you better get it all folded tonight, because guess where you are being whisked away to tomorrow.
Palm Springs, California, where the only thing hotter than the weather are the gay senior citizens and SOCALYALCON 6.
Jess, we've been talking about how much we appreciate your friendship and how close we both feel to you, right?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, I, too, have, um, - felt that closeness, and, um - That's why we got you this.
Oh, no.
- That is for you now.
- No.
This and a necklace?
Neck, neck, neck, neck, na-neck, neck, neck Neck's all loaded up.
Uh, but seriously, I can't accept this.
It's-it's too, um, expensive.
Money is no object.
That's why we rented a custom van, - and even got space radio.
- Satellite radio.
No, space radio, the one that connects to everything in the air.
- There's a satellite.
- What, the satellite's in the ground?
No, the satellite is in the air.
- Right.
Space.
Yeah.
- In the air.
Satellite radio.
And don't you worry about accommodations, because we also took care of that.
You got your very own hotel room.
It's adjacent to ours, but it's very private.
I mean, it is called a peekaboo suite, so there might be a little bit of crossover.
It's everything you like: it-it's kids, it's reading.
You are gonna get so many free bookmarks.
Do I get a per diem?
Yeah.
What's that?
- All right, doggy door.
- Sealed.
- Attic.
- Padlocked.
- Crawlspace.
- Uncrawlable.
The cast of Sneakers couldn't get into this place.
Uh Well, I guess I'm going to Palm Springs.
I just need your big-ass hat.
The front door.
Bye.
25 points of entry is too many points of entry!
-  - How?
How?
!
Wait, wait, don't tell me.
Agent Isosceles, part geometry prodigy, part CIA spy, all scared of girls.
- Wrong.
Cadet Isosceles.
- Oh.
It's all right.
You know, it's just, technically, this is just for myself  Wait.
Do you remember when you had to smuggle the golden sextant out of the Paris Math Academy?
- I do.
- I have a mission for you that is even more sensitive.
- Son of a - All right, this is the last of it.
Whew!
Are you sure we have to do this?
Babe, we're police officers who almost missed a shift because we were busy bouncing.
You're right.
Our capacity for joy is just way too high.
Okay, so I have one last secret.
So cute that you keep calling them secrets.
Just hear me out.
Um, I've lied to every girl I said "I love you" to.
I mean, I thought I loved them, but then I met you and realized I've never been in love before.
I did not know that.
Yeah, it was eating me up inside, so I called them each individually and said, "I never loved you".
Okay.
Seems unnecessary.
One of them took it very badly.
Oh, one of them took it badly?
I mean, she's okay now.
Well, sort kinda.
She lives at the top of a very tall tree.
Maybe, like, run stuff like that by me.
Okay, let me just sign this right here.
Here you go.
My associate asked me to give this to one of you.
She had to go.
The rest is in the note.
Uh, it says, "I had to go.
Jess".
Did she say any What's this book about?
Uh, it's I mean, it's it's hard to exp Reagan?
- Uh - Reagan, what is it Just tell her what it's about.
He wrote this book.
It's about a man with nothing, risking everything to feel something.
I'll take it.
Can you sign it?
"Kill yourself".
It's a joke.
It's a reference to You'll get it.
Hey, so how's SOCALYCAL SOCALYALCON 6?
I don't know.
I'm at the airport.
- What?
Where are you going?
- I don't know.
- How long you gonna be gone for?
- I don't know.
- What's two plus two?
- Four.
I'm listening to your questions, I just don't know the answer to them.
I mean, this isn't like you; you always say if you had to choose between planning a trip or taking a trip, you'd choose planning.
And I stand by that.
I just, I really need a change of scenery.
I'm probably just gonna hang with my dad in Portland.
I did what you said.
I did what was right for me today.
I just don't know what's right for me tomorrow.
I do know that the prices of the tickets are not going down while we yap.
So I got to go.
I love you.
Bye.
-  - Oh, Cece, I'm fine I don't know why you disappeared, Jess, but you know what, I'm sure you'll fill me in back at the hotel.
Also, when I sign a book "Kill yourself," you think they know that's a reference to Pepperwood's dilemma at the fish market, right?
Actually, you know what, that's a question for Reagan.
Okay, sorry.
See you later, Jess.
Cece, come check this out.
What?
Did that, did that just lock everything?
One touch secures every point of entry in the entire house, bringing us convenience and real-time peace of mind.
Okay, can I unlock it?
Well, unlocking it requires a pass code.
Ours is "my beautiful Cece," all one word.
- Very sweet.
-  Oh, shoot.
Actually, I screwed up.
Um, it's "my beautiful, beautiful Cece".
- Two "beautifuls".
- Okay.
Oh, you know what, I know what it is.
Great, just put it in.
I'm freezing.
I can't.
It only gives you three tries, then it locks you out of the app for 12 hours.
- For 12 hours?
!
- It's fine.
We'll go analog.
Give me your key.
Uh, I'd love to, but it's on the counter, next to yours.
It's gonna be fine.
Don't worry about a thing.
I promise you, we'll figure this out.
- Override.
-  - My beautiful, beautiful Cece.
-  - Override.
Override.
- Oh, God.
- Were you in the chimney?
-  Yes.
The 26th point of entry.
-  - Oh, my God.
Also, we have squirrels.
Aw, I love squirrels.
They're not alive.
I counted at least nine of 'em.
- Oh, my God.
Cece -  My beautiful, beautiful Cece!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
1 Jess, are you okay?
Honey, you just fled to your dad's house in Portland.
What I did was a very tasteful, very understated skedaddle so I could get some much needed space from Nick, and it worked.
I'm fine.
- So, you're coming back?
- I would, but Ashley's out of town, and the man doesn't do well without his wife.
I can't in good conscience leave my elderly father here without someone to help him steam-clean his bowling trophies.
Hey, Jess.
I think you should go home.
Shut up, TV!
That was the TV.
- Hello?
- Go home?
I just got here.
And I-I love that.
I love a surprise visit for no reason at all.
We had fun, but don't you think it's now, it's time for you to, you know, get back to your life.
Dad, you still need me.
I mean we really half-assed those trophies!
What?
Th-they look great.
Look.
Oh, this one.
This one is fantastic.
See this one?
This is the ball that I won that trophy with.
This ball right here.
Helen, I call - Oh!
Dad!
-  I-I waxed the holes.
You waxed the holes?
!
Was I-I not supposed to?
Not wise!
Not wise!
- It's okay.
-  I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, I'm so nervous to meet your mom.
I'm bad with women and family.
I wish she was a male stranger.
You guys talking about Charmaine?
- Yeah, my mom.
- Charmaine is a tough lady.
My mom is just protective, okay?
My dad walked out on us when I was a baby.
- I am her only son.
- Hey!
What are you guys doing here?
- Rude.
- What are we doing here?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Why are you here?
- What, just because we moved, we have to justify our presence here?
Well, you don't live here, so We're allowed to be here for no reason at all.
Oh, I get it.
You're sad and lonely in your new house and you miss us.
We do not need this.
If anything, you-you people need us.
We are married homeowners.
Benefit from our wisdom.
Okay!
I got to go.
Aly and I have an invited guest to plan for.
- Oh.
-  Good burn, Winston.
- You're getting better at those.
- Thanks, man!
Okay, I am off to my drug party.
Reagan's, uh, pharm rep crew is in town for a convention.
Have fun.
If you get too drunk to drive, call me, 'cause I will be, too, and we can be twins.
Wait, you're not going?
Don't you want to meet Reagan's friends?
Mm, we never really talked about it.
Seems like something that a married homeowner should weigh in on.
How could you not talk about such a major relationship step?
Ugh, because we're not all couple-y like you guys are.
We don't talk about every little tiny We don't gab all day like a couple of Italian grandmas hanging their laundry.
Talking is the lifeblood of a relationship.
- Truth.
- The problem is, is neither one of you wants to take the initiative.
You're both communication bottoms.
One of you needs to be the top.
What does this have anything to do with hamburger buns?
Look, we do things in our own way, right?
It's not like I don't want Nick to come with me.
And for the record, I would love to meet your friends.
- That would be great.
- So All right, I'm going!
Get off my back!
So what are you guys doing here?
- Never.
Never in my entire life.
- Okay.
- Never.
Never.
- My blood built this loft.
Maybe as an icebreaker we tell your mom about the time we actually arrested Jay Leno for jaywalking.
One small thing it's a footnote, really my mom don't know I'm a cop.
What?
- Winston, why?
- She's a-a protective single mom.
She's always freaked out at the tiniest thing.
My baby!
I turn my head for one second.
Lord, where is my baby?
!
- Wh - I went to look at bikes.
Oh!
She still thinks I'm in sports radio.
I still record shows for her.
You got to promise not to blow my cover.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I have so much police stuff.
Now, I realize you're getting caught up in a lie against your will, but my mom is coming to see you.
Okay?
It won't even come up.
But if it does, you're my producer.
- Bishop!
- I'm-a hide that.
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him Pretty slim pickings at the drugstore.
All I got was, uh, Freckle Me Once: The Unauthorized Lindsay Lohan Story.
Anyway, I got all your stuff your bandages, your hydrogen peroxide, your gummy peaches You're making too big a fuss out of this.
I mean, I've had so much worse.
This is just a bruised toe.
It's your index toe.
Very serious.
That's the toe you point with.
You've been great to me.
You've taken care of me.
Now I'm gonna do something for you.
I'm gonna get you a ticket.
Oh, here it is.
Portland to L.A. Dad, I am not leaving you like this.
Recovery is the most vulnerable part of the process, and this house is full of stairs and sharp corners.
And you know how slippery your bathtub is.
I won't stand up!
I'll just roll out!
Dad, I'm sorry, but I need to show you a little tough love.
Get in bed.
Do it.
"She was born on the freakiest of Fridays" Okay, we're in 42 markets, big show coming up - with Stephen A's brother Stephen B. - B. our lead-in is a cooking show - called The Ugly Dumpling - So funny.
Hey, is all of this necessary?
That's just in case it comes up.
Which, like I said  it won't.
Mm I feel like it might.
- Mother-in-law troubles, huh?
- What?
- Second mom drahm?
- Hey, seriously why are you still here?
That's your most pressing question right now?
Not why did I sign up for this ill-advised talk radio alternative reality?
Guys, we're trying to prep, okay?
So if you're gonna be in our home, please, step back from the mic.
That's radio lingo for when someone's on the microphone and you don't want them to be; - you say, "Step away from" - I got it.
Baby!
You are a radio personality!
You just can't leave your front door open for any ol' Menendez brothers to walk into.
- Ooh!
-   - This is Aly.
- Hey!
Long time listener, first time visitor.
- Oh.
-  Radio.
She referenced radio.
Uh, yeah, Mom, you know, we talk about work all day long, so Well, it's not work when it's with your girl.
Now, Aly, tell me, do you two ever sing the call letters to each other to fall asleep?
Mm, mm-hmm.
Yep.
KQWP Oh, I thought you two moved.
Whoa, drug companies have a lot of money.
Well, this is great.
I feel like you finally brought me to your home planet.
Yeah.
I'm really glad you came.
All right.
So tell me about these pharm reps I'm about to meet.
I mean, I don't know what I can really tell you about them.
We sort of became friends at these conventions, and we go from city to city with each other.
It's kind of like camp friends?
Except everybody's, uh, slept together a whole lot.
It's exactly like camp friends, I guess.
All these people have had sex with each other?
- Mostly, yeah.
- Mostly.
And with you?
You had sex with the yeah?
- Why wouldn't you?
- Yeah.
Oh, you guys are like groupies, but for yourself.
I dig it.
Are we gonna have to, like, talk this out right now?
Or - I'm good.
Are you good?
- Yeah.
- I'm cool.
- Okay.
Ah, I'm not a talker.
Talking's not my thing.
Great.
This is why we work.
'Cause we're not like Schmidt and Cece.
We don't have to write each other a love poem every time I go into the other room.
- Oh, pass.
-  Reags.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- How are you?
- Oh.
- Oh.
-  Off the ground.
- Jack.
- I'm Nick, and I-I might win a raffle tonight.
So, Reagan, you gonna save me a pas de deux tonight?
Okay.
What's going on?
What are you guys laughing at?
I don't get the joke.
Well, you do know that she was a professionally trained ballet dancer?
You never told me you were a ballerina.
I sort of shattered both of my ankles in this thing I refer to as "The Crackening".
Your ankles?
Like, both your ankles?
And both of my knees and a little bit of my pelvis.
What?
I could be the Queen of Egypt and your mom wouldn't know, because all she wants to do is talk about the radio show that doesn't exist.
That's on me.
Maybe I should have made my fake radio show less intriguing.
It's 7:12 and you know what that means.
Traffic on the 12 with Linda.
: It's just way too much damn traffic out here.
I can't get to work.
Linda.
Your big ass on the bus, stop playing.
Babe, how will I ever break through to your mom if I keep lying to her?
This is crazy.
- That's on me, too.
- I know it's on you.
You're the only person it could be on.
- And that is my bad.
- I know it's your bad.
Aly.
You have seven identical stripe long sleeve shirts?
Yeah.
I-I know it's strange.
Um, it-it was a deal.
- Buy five, get two free.
- Oh.
- You still got the receipt?
- Of course I do.
BB Taxx has the same items, four for $20.
Wait.
Are you a DDS?
DDS since '73.
What?
Are you both secret dentists?
CHARMAINE AND  Deep discount shoppers.
- OG price, $350.98.
- Ooh.
- BB Taxx price, - Uh-huh.
- $72.99 -  Ooh.
- $72.99!
- Ooh.
And someone didn't limit their price match to California.
Arkansas prices, y'all.
What do you say we get back in our cubbies - and keep this fashion show going.
- Okay.
I don't know why I'm just putting this together, but you two are very cheap.
- You're about to feel - You dunno what you're talking about.
- my cheap purse on your temple.
- You do not know.
Easy now.
What do you think, Nick?
Should she take it?
Take what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Reagan's big promotion.
Her promotion?
- Should she take it?
- I never I didn't hear about it until right now.
It's just VP of North American sales.
- VP?
- It's not a big deal.
It's just like a heartbeat away from president of North American sales, so - Seems like a pretty big deal.
- Reagan, it's huge.
You get to travel all the time.
So many hotel points.
Mo' points, mo' problems, that's what I always say.
It's exciting finding out this way.
Most people would probably tell their boyfriend when they first found out about it, but that's cool.
We don't talk, that's why we work, and that's cool and, uh, I'm really bothered by this.
- Nick.
-   Hey, Jess, it's me again.
Sorry to call you again.
I just I just really wish you would call me back.
I'm having a problem, and I feel like you really like when I'm, you know, I'm having a problem.
Not that you, not that you like it, but, but that-that you like, you like talking about it.
Anyway, I'm just coming apart here.
I'm-I'm really a hundred percent falling apart, and I really wish you would call me back.
-  - All right.
Hey, Schmidty, what's up?
Just checking in.
- Okay.
-  Oh, hold on, I got another call.
All of a sudden my phone's blowing up.
Hi.
This is Nick Miller.
Who am I speaking to and why are you calling?
- Do you not have my number saved?
- Who is this?
- Who is this?
- Who am I speaking to?
It's it's Cece.
Cece, why are you both calling me?
How do you not have my number saved?
I work for you.
Cece, I already got Nick.
Let me patch you in.
How am I supposed to learn to do a patch if you never let me try?
Nick, as the only person who takes our advice, - how you doing?
- Well, you were right.
Reagan and I never talk.
We helped you.
Cece, we helped him.
- I know, I heard.
- No.
You messed everything up.
You stupid idiots made me realize that I need more than that.
Now I got to go back to this party with her friends and pretend like it doesn't bother me.
- Those look fantastic.
-  Oh, honey, that sounds so rough.
I said ho one second, my man.
In the middle of a conversation.
Dad, I know you got out of bed.
No, I-I didn't, I didn't.
I-I-I've been, I've been sleeping.
I found these little crummies in the kitchen.
You only gave me a salad and tea.
I-I-I-I wanted some fish sticks.
Fish sticks are mostly pork and you know it.
Now, I'm gonna trim your nails.
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh, uh, uh, - it's-it's a little too short.
-  It's too ow, ow!
I have a good thing going with your mom right now, and I don't want to ruin that.
- We should just tell her the truth.
-  Hey-o!
Problem alert.
Well, if you need help, you've come to the right place.
Share, share.
Please.
Tell us what seems to be the problem.
Here's what you're doing, and it's not okay.
You're inserting yourself into a family matter.
We can handle this on our own.
- We're here if you need us.
- Yeah, watch your front, - 'cause we've got your back.
- We got your back.
I just want you to know that I respect that.
I'm perceiving that.
Um I'm digesting that.
It's in the machine.
It's working its way down.
And okay.
I think you're right.
I think it'll be really good for you to be honest with your mom.
No.
See, um, you're gonna come clean.
I'm gonna stay dirty.
- Why?
-  Aly, I found a roly-poly in these pants, they gave me 89% off.
- Oh.
-  That's sweet.
Um Charmaine, I have to tell you something.
I don't work in radio.
I don't.
I'm actually a cop.
What?
Man, you wearing a wire?
Okay.
: Sorry.
Well, I appreciate you telling me the truth.
The job is dangerous.
But I do salute your courage.
Okay.
Um you can salute me, too.
'Cause, uh, - I'm also a cop.
- What?
!
Uh, uh, uh, I'm-I'm not a super successful morning radio shock jock.
- There's no radio show?
- No.
I'm a - I'm an officer of the law.
- What?
!
That's not how you reacted when Aly said she was a cop.
Being a parent is like wearing your heart outside your body, and now you're telling me that my heart is on these streets by himself?
Sampling drugs with a knife to see if it's really cocaine?
My heart knows what cocaine tastes like?
- Oh, man.
-  - That's on you, man.
- Please shut up.
It isn't a dream job.
Sure, it comes with a great salary and a vaccination for the coming elk flu, the flu that you're gonna be hearing about for the next decade.
But it also requires too much travel, and I'm gonna turn it down.
- Are you happy now?
- No.
I'm not happy.
'Cause this is the kind of talk I wish we had before.
These are the important talks.
This is so unlike you.
Why are you being the girl in this argument?
I don't know, Reagan.
I don't know.
But I do know you're being heteronormative.
Okay?
I know that word it's in the Zeitgeist, and I know that word, too.
I don't know why I'm acting this way.
If you're out there, Nick Miller, you're our raffle winner!
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.
I did spend $190 on tickets.
$200.
I spent $250 on tickets.
That's it.
I spent over $300 on tickets.
"Deciding which house to go to for Thanksgiving, "she was stuck in a real parent trap".
- Enough.
Enough.
Enough.
- Oh, you're right.
- This chapter's dragging.
- Jess, please.
- Let me move on.
- I-I need my freedom.
I need my judge shows, my fish sticks.
My-my naked time.
- Oh, please don't expand on that.
- No, it's a good thing.
Ashley showed me how to embrace my body.
And I every day, for about a half an hour, I walk around here naked.
- Fabulous.
- Did you sit on this chair?
Jess now I'm gonna show you some tough love.
I want you to go back to California.
Wh-what's going on?
It's Nick.
I - What?
- I'm-I'm in love with him, and I can't I can't do anything about it.
I'm sorry.
He's really happy with someone else.
- I couldn't go back there.
- Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.
You don't have to.
You can stay here as long as you want.
You've been taking care of me, now I'm gonna take care of you.
You know what, I'm gonna read you one of my favorite books.
See?
- Oh - Before the Web: The Story of Telephone Operators.
"She sat by the switchboard, "anxiously awaiting "the phone call.
"Ring.
Ring.
"Ring".
I don't even understand what we're arguing about.
I'm mad about the promotion.
And that you have been sitting on it for a month and not telling me.
I thought that you liked that we have our own thing.
- I don't know, maybe I - That we were two independent, different people and we live our lives and then we come together and we hang out.
I just want more, I guess.
I want to talk about stuff, and I know while I'm saying this I hate that I'm saying it, but I feel it.
Nick, we're talking about stuff right now.
No, we're not talking about all the stuff.
- We're talking about some of the stuff.
- How much stuff is there?
There's piles of stuff.
There's piles upon piles of stuff.
Like, I want to talk about I want to talk about why we don't have nicknames for each other?
I mean, why don't we call each other Mr. Cub and Sparky?
Who's Mr. Cub?
You're Mr. Cub?
You think I would be Sparky?
If we had nicknames it would not be those.
You just call me Nick, is my point.
- That's your name.
- I know, but I would like to talk about nicknames.
It doesn't matter.
All this matters.
This is the stuff.
I want to talk about why you have a second apartment.
- We talked about that.
- And it was weird then.
We barely talked about it.
I also want to talk about the fact I've never been at my best sexually with you.
I've been, like, a seven, but, at other times in my life, I've been an eight-and-a-half.
- Okay.
- But you've only seen a seven.
So you think of me as a seven in bed.
- But I'm an eight-and-a-half.
- I'm really tired.
Can you just write it all down and I'll fill it out and I'll get it back to you.
All right, then just answer me this, and then we'll be done.
'Cause this is important.
If we weren't together and you were offered this same promotion, would you take it?
Yes, I would take it.
Then you should take the job, Reagan.
Okay, I'll take it.
Are we cool?
Yeah.
Dream job.
Good, I'm so happy for you.
This is awesome.
Uh, okay.
But before we go to bed tonight, can you please just do something about your raffle prize?
- His name's Stewart.
- Why did you bring it home?
I don't know, I won.
Hey, thought I might find you here.
Oh.
- Hiding your maybes?
-  Sometimes I hide mine in a garbage can.
A new one.
Don't try to talk me out of worrying about my son.
I won't.
I just want you to know you're not alone.
I'm out there worrying about him, too, but we have got each other's backs.
How's that dress gonna fit you when you ain't got no legs?
Oh.
I need to tell you something.
No, no, just let me go first.
This job has given me so much.
Purpose, pride, my future wife, CPR certification against my will, I might add, because I truly believe that it is witchcraft, but that's not the point.
I have tried so many things.
But being a cop is the first time I've ever felt a calling.
I'm proud of you.
Yeah.
I-I will deal with my fears.
Um but there's one more thing.
Oh, my God.
Mom, you've been a cop this whole time?
No.
- You're not a cop.
- It was your dad's.
He's a cop.
Wherever the hell he is.
Wow.
Um You know, that's the first thing you ever told me about him.
So you know I got a lot of practice worrying about someone coming home.
Maybe that's the reason I'm so overprotective with you.
He left this behind, among other things.
I just use it to get out of tickets.
And one time I did use it for a discount on a - a rental car.
- Oh.
- Take it.
- No, I don't want it.
You're my dad.
You're my mom and my dad.
I know that.
And I'm not saying he's not a piece of crap, either.
But you should have this.
We can talk about this later, but what was the rental car company you used?
Well, I don't think me and Reagan are working out.
Really?
Oh, bub, I'm so sorry.
Come lay your head on my bosom.
Come here.
No, I'll do hers if I was gonna do either, but well, I'm really glad you guys are here.
Tell us everything.
- But first, say that one more time.
- Oh, you really want me to?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh.
Uh, I'm really glad you're here.
We're really glad that we're here, too.
Very happy about it.
- All right.
- One more time.
The part about you being glad that we're here.
- Making me regret it.
- One more time.
I feel like we talked about everything.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
: I like American football a lot.
And you know who I like, I like that Tom Brady.
Uh, I like the way he looks, I like the way he smells.
Nick, shut up, man!
I'm at I'm at work.
Mi-mi-mi, mi-mi-mi.
Chacho.
: Chacho.
This is traffic on the 12.
Linda?
Move!
Get your ass out the way!
I'm trying to get to work on time.
Linda, you okay?
I'm fine.
It's the reason why I'm late.
I'm in traffic behind a damn Camry.
If he don't move his ass out the way Linda, all right, that's enough of you.
PG-13.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
1 The dream is dead.
Say good-bye to the Schmidt Charitable Trust.
I don't know what that is.
But is that why you were throwing light bulbs against our garage?
- That was unrelated.
- Oh.
It's the foundation that I was going to establish to take the Schmidt brand to the next level, but now I can't.
- The name is taken.
- What?
Get a load of that.
The Schmidt Charitable Trust was established in 1948 by Cranston Schmidt, to promote nudity in restaurants.
Cranston Schmidt and his naked waitresses.
What am I supposed to do now?
How can I show my peers that I make so much money that I could just throw it away on strangers?
There is one way that you could maybe solve your problem.
- What?
- You could use your first name.
What did you say?
You are not a frat boy drinking at a keg anymore, okay?
You are an executive now.
- You're a baller.
- I am a baller.
Also, I was never allowed in frats.
Too much hazing that required a visible penis.
- Oh, baby.
-  Just do it.
-  - Like, who cares?
- How long have you been here?
- Long enough, Schmidt.
Yeah, we keep the camera running all day.
I'm trying to keep Jess company while she's in Portland.
Yeah, yesterday I watched Cece read for a while.
Oh, wow, that sounds like fun, Jess, good for you.
- Cece - Jess needs us right now.
She's still mopey over Nick.
I'm not mopey.
I'm rad.
I'm gleaming the cube.
She's lying.
She's a wreck.
Ugh, Dad!
Ugh, I'm on the phone!
You're so embarrassing.
All he does is just recycle cans all day.
I wish his child bride would come back from Denver so he'd have someone else to bother.
Let's just get you out of this house.
- Yeah, right.
- Well, what are you going to do?
You're gonna sit on this couch all day long?
You'll get sofa butt.
Come on, let's go get some ice cream.
Ugh, I hate ice cream.
Dad!
- Nobody hates ice cream.
- It's stupid.
- I-I feel uncomfortable watching this.
- Yeah, it's stupid, Dad.
It's so stupid.
- Hey, Cece.
- Dad.
Hi, Schmidt.
How are you?
Dad!
Don't talk to my friends!
Achoo!
- Oh, you're up.
- You woke me up.
Hey, do you mind if I run something by you that's very personal, very hot button?
I do I need to rest.
- I'm working nights this week.
- Oh, as a police officer?
No, Nick, as a prostitute.
Yes, as a cop.
Now will you please leave my room?
I'm very tired and I need to get some rest.
I understand, but here it comes, I have to tell you.
- I don't want to hear it.
- Aly, I'm gonna tell you.
- I swear to God.
- I need to break up with Reagan - but I don't know how to.
- Damn it, Nick.
Oh, now you're involved.
So now that you're involved, we need to talk it out 'cause we're basically partners in this.
- We're not partners.
- Things with Reagan and I haven't been working out, and last night it really came to a head.
It's just crazy.
You know, - I was just driving down the - Mm-hmm.
Sounds crazy.
- Reagan.
- Yes?
I worked all day.
We haven't seen each other.
Don't you want to catch up?
Yes.
Fine, what?
What happened to you today?
I saw a seagull in the backseat of a moving car.
Can we have sex now?
Ugh, you don't get it.
Let's get it over with.
What does this have to do with me?
I was hoping you'd tell me how to break up with her.
Just pretend you're an adult - and get it over with.
- Yeah.
Train's already left the station, Nick.
The longer you wait, the worse it's gonna get.
The train already left the station, huh?
- Yep.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Hey, say, wake up.
Question.
Excuse me.
Yes, Nick?
Do you think that looks like a monster's butthole?
I kind of do, yeah.
Yeah, me, too.
It's really gross.
What's going on, Schmidt?
Man, are you having trouble ordering from that Jamaican restaurant again?
I don't know how many times I got to tell you.
Don't walk in there using their accent 'cause it's kind of racist.
The time has finally come for me to launch my own brand.
- Are you really not gonna turn around?
- Not yet.
This brand will be my legacy.
And this is where you come in.
Ooh!
You had that timed right!
I'm going to start using my first name again.
Schmidt, I think that is a very bad idea.
I have no choice!
When I was born, my parents gave me a name.
Don't do this, Schmidt.
Ain't nothing but pain down that road.
It is the name that I was called for most of my life, and I want my name back.
Isn't this fun?
Remember, we used to come here all the time, every time you won a tennis match.
- That was your other daughter.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
You-You were always in a production of Annie, but never Annie, though.
Priscilla, come here, come here.
I want you to meet my daughter, Jessica.
Remember?
I told you about her.
She's the one that doesn't play tennis.
Oh, the teacher from Hollywood.
Well, two rum raisin sundaes and whatever my daughter wants.
You.
: Her husband fell down a spiral staircase.
- What?
- He kept falling, falling, continually falling.
It was awful.
He didn't die.
But when he found out that he had become a viral sensation - he killed himself.
- Ugh.
I know how he feels.
Jess, are you still upset about Nick?
You got to, you got to move past that.
It's hard.
You don't know what it's like to be alone.
I do know what it's like.
- Ashley and I broke up.
- What?
!
- Yeah.
- When?
Yeah, about six months ago.
Uh, but I-I didn't want to worry you.
Dad.
It's my job to worry.
Was it the 40-year age difference?
Were you tired of waiters just asking again and again if it was a daddy-daughter dinner?
Sorry, no, that's not  You said that the pill sold itself, so let me ask you, is the pill a cure for a kick in the balls?
Because you're gonna need it.
- Oh, no.
- Hey, Nicky, what's up?
Uh, I can wait.
No, it's okay, go ahead, I'm sorry.
I want to tell you  - What?
- I said what I needed to say.
Nothing came out of your mouth.
I feel like we're on a train.
Where are we going?
We're going to San Diego.
- What?
- I panicked and it just came out.
Let me tell you something, sister, your plan didn't work.
This wasn't my plan.
Well, you brought up trains, didn't you?
And you got in my head.
San Diego part?
Well, that's on me.
I'm not engaging with you over this.
- So, what do we do now?
- I don't know, Nick.
I've never experienced a person trying to break up with someone, and instead inviting them on a beach vacation.
I didn't do this on purpose.
I feel like you led me here.
- This is not on me.
- So what do you want me to do?
You want me to go break up with her down in San Diego?
I don't, I don't care at this point.
- Why?
Because it's private?
- Live your life, man.
Because the weather is really nice?
And what happens if it doesn't work out?
I'm just gonna go move down to Mexico and start a new life?
No one's suggesting any of this.
You're a genius.
Thank you, Aly.
I knew I came to the right person.
I'll do it.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I feel like I should call San Diego to warn them about you.
But you seem convinced, so if it gets you out of here faster, God bless.
- Do you believe in God, Aly?
- I believe in hell and I'm in it.
- Oh, this is hell?
- Yes!
Then why don't you stay out of my business?
!
That's all I'm trying to do, but you keep bringing me your business!
Ah, to hell with you!
We're going to San Diego!
- Fine!
- Fine!
- Go!
- I'm going!
Don't say anything.
I should have known right from the start.
On our honeymoon, we're in the ocean, a-a-and Ashley sees a shark coming towards us.
You know what she does?
She pushes me in front of it and says, "Eat him!
Eat him"!
- What?
- That-that was a clue.
- That was a clue.
- I just hate thinking of you all alone in that house.
I'm fine.
I got my cans.
Gets me out of bed in the morning.
- What if you met someone new?
- Oh, no.
-  Really.
-  Aw, no.
Dad, what about - what about Priscilla?
- What?
- What?
Come on.
- No.
No.
I'm an old man.
She doesn't want an old man.
Look.
I've got a Band-Aid on my hand.
Not on the finger, the hand.
That is an old-man thing.
Okay.
Hey, Priscilla.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hi.
I was wondering if you would like to get a decaf coffee and talk about local news with my dad.
Really, Bob?
You want to take me out?
- Ha, ha, ha, you -  Let's do it.
Let's do it.
Yeah, I have a new jean jacket I've been wanting to break out.
It's stone-washed.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, that was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Even though this morning I thought you were married.
What about you?
I'm supposed to be cheering you up.
You did cheer me up.
You got me off of the couch.
It's good to be out of the house.
You kids have fun.
Okay, thanks.
So this is a surprise.
Where do you think we should go?
Where do you think we should go?
Look, Schmidt, we both know there's only room for one Winston.
And we found that out the hard way, didn't we?
Homecoming weekend, 2002.
- I'm Winston!
I'm Winston!
- I'm Winston!
I'm Winston!
We can't live like this!
- Only one Winston.
- Body slam!
Get off!
Get off!
You'll kill him!
We have tried every single variation.
Fat Winston, Thin Winston.
Too derogatory.
Black Winston, Jew Winston.
Obviously problematic.
Hot Winston, Ugly Winston.
Now that nearly tore us apart.
Which is why we came up with the one-Winston rule.
Yeah, but those were angry times.
Let's make it double W's.
Welcome back, Winston.
It's good to be back, Winston.
-  San Diego.
- The wonderful San Diego.
- Where are we staying?
- Not sure.
Maybe we're gonna get the nicest hotel in the city, huh?
Maybe you're gonna stay there, and maybe I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles today.
I'm gonna stay in San Diego, and you're gonna go back?
Who knows what's gonna happen down there?
That's the fun of a trip like this.
Nick, you would tell me if you were gonna murder me, right?
No, 'cause then you could prepare for it, you silly.
What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with me?
- Yeah.
The guy taking you to San Diego the Paris of Southern California?
- Okay.
- You're losing it.
I'm acting totally normal.
You need a drink just to chill out.
- What is wrong with you?
- Getting those drinks.
MAN : This stop, Anaheim.
You should have seen him.
The only time my dad gets that nervous is when he doesn't know where to print out his boarding pass.
It's so weird to think of him dating again.
- BOB : Oh!
Oh - Wait.
What is that?
It sounds like someone's moving a washing machine.
Oh, my God, my dad's boning!
- My dad's boning!
My dad's boning!
- Oh, my God, listen to me.
Get out of the house.
Get out of the house!
-  Jess?
Is that you?
- No.
Yes.
I mean, no, it's the cans.
I just, um Finish what you're doing.
No, don't finish.
I mean, everyone deserves to finish oh, God!
-  - Oh, cans!
- Can we talk about this?
- Yeah, just one sec.
I'm just replacing the sound of your skin slapping against someone else's with the sound of crushing metal.
I didn't know you were gonna be home.
I thought you were gonna be out having a day.
And you were supposed to be having coffee.
You just put out on the first date?
We had a connection.
I-I think I'm in love with her.
Oh, my God, I need more cans.
I got to have more cans.
Hey, you know, I'm a passionate guy.
- All right.
- What are you doing, Dad?
Well, I mean, you were nice enough to help me to move on.
Now I'm gonna see if I can find somebody for you.
Got it.
My best friend Ray.
His son John.
Well, he's a little heavyset, but, you know, he makes a good living.
Dad, put the Rolodex down.
Look, we're not in the same boat, okay?
I can't move on.
I love him.
Nick?
What do you see in him?
I mean, he looks like the only white waiter at a Chinese restaurant.
There isn't a logical explanation, but it is what it is.
I love him.
I wish I didn't, but I do.
- Come here.
- Dad, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the recycling plant.
It closes in an hour.
From now on, I will be Winston Schmidt, and he will be Winston Bishop.
We are both Winstons.
Wait, your first name is Winston?
- Did I know that?
- No.
I have not slept in 36 hours.
Well, you should get some sleep.
- Isn't that right, Winston?
- Oh, absolutely, Winston.
Sleep is very important.
It is the most important, Winston.
Okay, this is already too much.
In my head it wasn't this annoying.
Winston, why don't you just go by "The Bish"?
- I'm sorry, are you talking to me?
- You know I'm talking to you.
I knew she was talking to you.
- You knew the whole time?
- Yeah.
Ooh, I couldn't tell.
Wait a minute, why does Winston - Yes?
- Oh, my God.
Why does my Winston have to change his name?
- Schmidt, don't you have a middle name?
- I do have a middle name.
- It's Saint-Marie.
- Hmm.
- And obviously I can't go by that.
- That's hilarious.
Oh, hello, hello!
Wait, what are you doing here?
Oh, well, I couldn't break up with Reagan, - so I jumped off the train.
- Hmm?
- Problem, problem solved.
- What's up with you guys?
- Why didn't I know about this?
- I don't know, Schmidt, 'cause you weren't around, I guess.
Well, actually, I'm Winston now.
I'm using my first name again.
Uh actually there can't be two Winstons.
It nearly destroyed us.
Nick, hold up, can we go back to that moment where you jumped off a train?
Sure.
You find that part interesting?
Okay, I don't care about the answer, but I feel like I got to ask, as someone who works in law enforcement where is Reagan?
Well, she's probably getting off at the next stop, and then she'll be on her way here for some sort of a reckoning, I would imagine.
"Problem solved" was probably a bit of a, an overstatement.
The good news is that I don't have to break up with her 'cause now she's gonna break up with me.
- Oh, Nick.
- What is wrong with you?
It's gonna be okay, Nick.
Give Winston a hug.
- Come on.
Here we go.
- Here you go, Winston.
I meant "me Winston".
- I'm "me Winston," too!
- Hey, guys!
Reagan's on her way.
I've got too much to deal with to deal with this two Winstons thing.
What, I can't have a first name because you left some woman on a train?
Don't put that on me, man!
I'm not calling you Winston, Schmidt.
'Cause if I do, then what am I gonna call the real Winston?
Call him I don't care!
I don't care!
- Hey, Winston, you want to get a drink?
- Sure.
- I'm down.
- I was talking to that Winston.
- Oh.
- After the drink, you want to get some dinner, Winston?
- Ooh, you know your boy hungry.
- Yes.
That time I was talking to this Winston.
- So, I can come if you want.
- I'm down to go.
No, I'm trying to figure it out, okay?
Wait, time out.
Are we eating, or are we not eating?
They're both real Winstons, but the old Winston is now The Bish.
I'm not calling my fiancÃ© "The" anything.
Nah, man, this is taking me to a bad place.
- I'm having I'm having cold feet.
- What?
Yeah, the two Winstons thing is not gonna work Nick is right.
You've had Winston for 15 years.
It's my turn.
I'm Winston.
You will never be Winston.
- Oh, you want to dance?
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?
Okay.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Okay, what is happening?
-  Come on.
-  Come on.
- I used to live by myself.
- Come on.
- Come on.
I had covered parking, I was happy.
- I'm Winston.
- Guys, no.
It's not about you, man.
I am Winston.
Shut up!
I'll kill you!
I'll murder you!
I can't do this right now.
I got too much on my plate.
- I'm Winston.
- I'm Winston.
- Nah, I'm Winston.
- Ah, I'm Winston.
Yet, somehow, all the Michaels in the world manage to deal with this every day.
Mm-hmm.
Go to sleep, go to sleep.
- Hello?
- Mr. Day.
It's Nick Miller.
- Is Jess there?
- She's out.
Can I take what I assume will be an idiotic message?
Ah, it's actually, it's kind of private.
Okay, fine.
Talk to you later.
Fine, I'll tell you, I'll tell you.
I'm breaking up with Reagan and it didn't quite go as planned.
I'm, I'm in a really bad situation and Jess always says the right thing and I, I really need her.
Let me, let me ask you a question.
You're in the ocean with Jess, and a shark starts coming towards you.
- What do you do?
- Which ocean?
I-I don't know, Pacific.
- What type of shark?
- What the hell difference does it make?
Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.
Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing if not, it definitely should be.
It's just a regular shark.
You know what?
Good-bye.
Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me, I'm sure I'm sure we'd be okay.
She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and she's just the greatest person I have ever met.
Bob?
Does that answer your question or what?
It does.
Weirdly enough, it does.
But I also don't accept your weird-ass premise, man, 'cause it's absolutely preposterous -  Nick.
-  Oh, my God.
She's here.
Nick.
Nicholas, I can see you.
Hey.
How was San Diego?
Hey, so Reagan's in your room, packing up her stuff.
What'd you say to her?
Nothing.
I-I didn't say anything.
I just, uh, crawled out from under the bed where I was hiding.
She said, "It's over," which makes sense, and then I came in here, and this is now my fifth beer in as many minutes.
- I'm impressed.
- No, you shouldn't be.
I once drank nine beers in five minutes.
I hear that cry for help, but I meant the breakup.
You ended a relationship without any confrontation.
You got what you wanted.
Then why do I feel so terrible?
Maybe you feel bad because your relationship with Reagan actually meant something to you, and you ended it like it didn't.
Right.
I'm sorry I put you in the middle of this, Aly.
But I'm also glad you were here 'cause I feel like we bonded.
It was one of the most frustrating days of my entire life.
I'm exhausted.
I feel like a single mom in a mop commercial.
Welcome to the loft.
Hey.
Taking a little trip?
I hear San Diego's lovely.
I regret that.
I'm sorry I left you on the train, Reagan.
You deserve better than that.
The truth is, is I wanted to break up with you, and I didn't know how to.
Okay.
I mean, I'm not mad anymore, more just scared of what it must be like to have to live inside of your head.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I've been thinking about breaking up with you for a while.
So, we just wanted really different things.
I'm not good at good-byes, Nick.
I'm not good at good-byes either.
I think I'm gonna go stand in the closet for a little bit.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Bye, Nick.
Yeah, bye, Reagan.
What do you want?
To be your friend.
If you need the name Winston to get you to where you're going, then I'm not gonna stand in your way.
You're a good friend.
Uh, uh, what will I call you?
Well, I was gonna give Saint-Marie a whirl, but then I was like, nah, that's a girl's name.
And I thought about Two-Shoes.
- Two-Shoes.
- Two-Shoes, yeah.
But then, in certain shoes that I have, I have three of them, so so I'm just gonna stick with The Bish.
Come here.
Thank you, The Bish.
Thanks, Winston.
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you come on inside Very weird.
Strange man.
I love Wednesday nights.
And this one's even more special, 'cause I got my name back.
I love you, Cece.
I love you so much, Winston.
Oh, God.
I don't like it!
I don't like it!
I don't like it!
- Damn it!
- Ugh Take your name back.
I don't want it.
- What's wrong with the name Winston?
- It's horrible, just take it back.
Worst name in the entire history of names.
What'd you say about my name?
Stop.
N You know what, I don't care.
Come on.
Cha-ching.
Hey, hey, Jess!
Jess!
I've been trying to call you.
I-I talked to Nick.
- What?
- He called looking for you, and you know, oddly, I-I see what you see in him.
It doesn't matter.
He has a girlfriend.
He and Reagan broke up.
And you know something?
I don't even think he realizes it, but he's still in love with you.
I got you, I got you!
I got you!
Got your arm!
I'm gonna break it.
Aah, that's my arm!
I need it, I need it!
It's only a matter of time before life begins You talk to a stranger and suddenly you're friends There she goes.
Off to college.
Circle of life.
Okay.
Before you even learn to break or bend  This is right.
I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna profess my love to Nick.
- I'm very proud of you, sweetie.
- Thanks, Dad.
I'm proud of you, too.
You really just humped your way right into things, didn't you, Priscilla?
- I kinda wanted the front seat.
- I called it.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
1 So, I've got it all planned out.
I'm gonna surprise Nick at his book reading, and afterwards, when he's on a big high, I'm gonna tell him how I feel.
You think this is a little soon after the breakup with Reagan?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm worried, very worried.
But you know what, I wrote everything out on the plane, like what I'm gonna say.
It's all on flash cards, some of it's in song, I would do it for you, but some of the jokes are at your expense, - so, uh -  Jess, why don't you just tell him how you feel?
You know, no jokes, no songs, just from the heart.
No songs.
-  - Yeah.
No songs.
No songs, she said.
-  "Pepperwood lay on the ground - "in a puddle of blood.
"Jessica Night broke through the barricades and ran to his side.
"'Even though he doesn't have muscles, "he seems incredibly strong' Jessica thought, "as she looked into his perfect, sexy face.
"Even now, even covered "in the blood of the man they both knew as Schmith, "the two sat in silence in the hot, New Orleans night, "waiting for the words that would never come".
I'm gonna open up the floor to some questions.
Uh, the young lady right here in the strange-looking vest.
No offense.
When are Pepperwood and Jessica Night going to get together?
-  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That is a great question.
I'll just cut to it, guys.
Uh, Pepperwood and Jessica Night will never get together.
Never.
I'm sorry.
You guys, stop.
It's just, look, these characters, they-they are based off real people.
A-and the real people are just fundamentally different.
They don't work together.
It's just never gonna happen.
- You just got to forget about it.
- Excuse me.
Move on from it.
And also, you know, Pepperwood, he blew it.
Sometimes you don't get another chance, you know, to-to fix the mistake.
It's just look, adult relationships are really complicated.
So, let's hear it for books!
All right, wow, you guys are super intense.
Hi.
- I'm Merle Streep.
- I don't care.
Okay.
Um, I'm an editor and I publish children's books, - so I wanted - Oh, congratulations to you.
What would you like me to do about that?
Uh, I'm about to make a call, so - Nice to meet you, Merle Streep.
-  - Goofy name.
Okay.
- I'll I'll okay.
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, this is crazy, but were you just at my reading?
You're not in L.A., are you?
No, I'm in Portland with my dad.
- That's what I thought.
- How'd the reading go?
Couldn't have gone better.
I felt weirdly comfortable up there.
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thanks.
Reagan and I broke up.
I got to go.
Oh, my dad just sprained his thumb trying to get up off a couch.
I'll talk to you later, Nick.
Sorry.
So, is now a good time to talk to you?
Because I'd like to talk to you about publishing your book.
You'd like to talk to me about what?
Publishing your book.
What are you, some kind of a-a publisher?
Yeah, that's what my card I was trying to give you my card, but you - You want to publish my book?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I want you to publish my book.
- Is this how you normally are?
- No.
Babe, hi.
Are your pants off?
I I went to the reading and Oh, no, what happened?
I'm so sorry I'm not wearing pants.
Schmidt's been so busy with work, we scheduled a no-pants dinner thing.
Do you want me to take my pants off, too?
Oh, no, honey.
Tell me everything.
That's it.
I'm all moved in.
This is my last box and it's labeled "holiday important".
So, it's definitely sex toys.
Well, then I wonder what's in this box.
It's labeled "documents".
Eh, it's just documents.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's nothing.
- I - Wait, wait, wait.
You have a mug shot of the diaper bandit?
- With a phone number on the back?
- All right.
Listen, I-I wanted to wait for the right time to tell you this.
Have you been keeping in touch with the diaper bandit?
What?
No.
No, listen.
I That's actually your dad's phone number.
You said you wanted to find him, so I found him.
: My dad is the diaper bandit?
- No.
- Oh.
- Forget about the diaper bandit.
- That'd have been weird.
Cece : I'm not wearing any pants.
: Honey.
-  - Oh, no!
Oh, no!
I touched one of your breasts!
Where is my wife?
!
I can never be the same!
- Let's just move on.
- I'm fine.
No, it's fine.
I panicked, and I told him I was in Portland, and now I can't go back to the loft.
To play devil's advocate, he was just talking about characters in his novel.
I mean, look, the character based on me is a Jewish psychopath who wears a bolo tie and eats applesauce out of a baboon's skull.
No, he was talking about us.
He just doesn't feel the way I feel.
I I can't see him.
Hey, it's me, Nick.
In three, two - Hang on, wrong key.
-  Get in the kitchen.
- Go, shoo, scram.
-  That was for my chest drawer.
- Got it.
-  My man.
I don't love this couch.
Did you take the tags off already?
It's the perfect couch.
What are you doing here?
Well, I need to talk to you and my phone's only at five percent.
- Well, why didn't you - I can't find the charger.
- It's under Winston's pillow.
- I looked in Winston's room.
- Did you look under the pillow?
- Yeah, yeah.
I - Yeah.
I went in there.
I - No, you didn't.
I didn't look in Winston's room, but I need to talk to you.
An editor wants to publish my book.
Pass immediately and start a bidding war.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
Mazel.
- That's incredible, Nick.
- Thanks.
I called Jess, but she didn't answer.
I was really hoping to tell her about it, but she hung up on me earlier and now she won't pick up the phone.
- What are you doing?
- Shh!
Shh, shh!
: What, what, what?
- Oh, Nick's here?
- Shh!
You're yelling.
- I'm not yelling.
- You're yelling.
You're coming with me to the meeting tomorrow.
I'm picking you up at 9:00 A.M. - I have to go to the kitchen.
- I'll come with.
I'm starving.
No.
Where are you Come to the kitchen with me then, Nick.
: Wait, why are you crawling?
: I don't know.
Just go.
- Hey, do you have any -  angel hair pasta in here?
I don't see it.
Ooh, you know what?
Uh.
excuse me, I have to go to the bedroom now.
: Jess, this is very stressful.
I know.
Look, tomorrow, you need to go to that meeting with Nick and you need to stay with him until I'm packed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, packed?
- I just army-crawled across your entire house to get away from my ex-boyfriend who I still live with.
I-I can't do this anymore.
I need, I need to get out of here and get some space.
I'm moving out of the loft.
What?
I couldn't find your trash bin, so I threw it away in the toilet.
- What'd you throw in the toilet?
- The, uh, salami in the fridge.
- What?
- I didn't flush it.
So, you're gonna have a bunch of salami floating around in your toilet bowl.
What?
So Jess is just moving out because Nick said something dumb at a reading?
Nick is always dumb.
He's the dumbest boy in school.
I had no idea you cared so much about what happens to Nick and Jess.
How could I not?
I've been watching these idiots do this dance for the last six years.
He's rough and tumble.
She's sweet and sassy.
It's the moon and the tides, it's the push and the pull.
I know, it just makes so much sense.
I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him.
I'm gonna go tell him that she loves him, I'm gonna burst in the door, and I'm gonna say, "Nick, she loves you," and then No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We cannot get involved.
Okay.
- Okay?
- You're right.
- You're right, okay.
- All right.
Okay.
- I should've worn shorts.
- No, no.
I would've looked amazing in shorts.
I got rid of all the shorts, you nut-ball.
You are really grumpy this morning.
Well, I was up late last night, - talking to Cece about you.
- For what?
Nick, I want to tell you something, but but I can't.
So I'm just gonna ask you this: why on earth do you think that you are so okay with this Reagan breakup?
Reagan and I are at different places of our life.
It's fine.
Why hasn't Jess called me back?
You guys are pretty good friends, right?
But if you remember correctly, you didn't even want Jess to move in to the loft.
Nick, why do you think that is?
I'm pretty freaked out by sanitary napkins.
Why don't you think you wanted Jess to move in to the loft?
I don't know, 'cause I, 'cause I was afraid.
Nick, you have been in love with this girl from the moment you opened the door and you first laid eyes on her.
I have never seen you look at anyone else like that in my entire life.
Except maybe, on a few occasions, me.
I've never looked at you the same way I look at Jess.
- There's been a few times.
- I there's never been a time.
You looked at Coach maybe once or twice like that.
Me, several times.
Winston, never.
Let's table it.
You're wrong.
The first time I saw Jess was I was standing in her empty room, and I was looking out the window.
- She was trying to get in the building.
- Okay.
Pretty hilarious.
She didn't have her glasses on, and she was bumping into stuff.
Will you listen to yourself?
I shouldn't be telling you this, but Jess is not in Portland.
She's here.
And she's packing up her stuff because she's going to move out of the loft for good.
Nick.
Wait, she's gonna move out of the loft?
For once in your life, don't be afraid.
Ready to come in and talk?
Hello.
I'm, uh, Winston Schmidt, Nick's associate.
That's right.
Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.
What?
Children's literature just got a brand-new daddy.
Don't say that here anymore, okay?
Thank you.
So sorry I'm late, but Sadie would not stop going on about her divorce, and I was like, "Girl, can you just be quiet "and look at my vagina, please"?
The fact that we have the same gynecologist really makes me feel closer to you.
Wait, is this all you have packed?
I mean, Nick's gonna be here in two hours.
- I know.
- Hey.
You know what?
If this is too hard right now, you don't have to do this.
Just give yourself some time and think it through.
If my stuff is here, I'll just end up living here again.
You know me; I live where my stuff lives.
When I come back for the school year, I'll find a new place.
All right.
Well, if we're gonna do this, then we better get moving.
Yep.
My God, I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm gonna miss you so much, too.
But it's just one summer.
It's fine.
Okay, I know, but I'm just gonna miss you.
Me, too.
- This is dumb!
- It's one summer.
- It's one summer.
- It's one summer.
It's fine.
We can get through one summer.
It's fine.
I'm gonna miss you, like, day-to-day.
Who am I gonna talk to every day?
Mine, mine is this mine?
Are you collecting things for Goodwill?
I'm not donating things, I'm moving out.
What?
Look, I'm just going to Portland for the summer to get away.
Sure.
You go to Portland, have a fun summer, but then what about after that?
Huh?
When will we see you?
Who will your friends be?
Who you gonna hang out with?
Okay, think about the people you are leaving behind.
Also, side note, Aly has my dad's number!
- Okay.
- Wait, what?
- I got his dad's number.
- My dad's name is Van, by the way.
Oh, my God, Winston, that's a huge deal!
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Are you gonna call him?
No.
I can't call my dad.
I just can't.
You know what?
You don't have to call him if you don't want to.
You can always just escape to Portland Oh, my God!
You can come with me to Portland!
Furgie's gonna love it.
It's the second most cat-friendly Portland after Portland, Maine, according to Paws magazine.
- Are you going to Portland?
- No.
Portland is hella white.
Ooh.
Sadie.
Hello.
: Cece, you're pregnant.
Oh, my God Cece's pregnant.
Why are you picking up someone else's phone?
Call back in five minutes, and we will agree to lie to our friend for the rest of our lives.
Oh, God.
You're gonna be in my office throughout the pregnancy, aren't you?
So I am double-parked, so if you got any boxes I can take down to the car.
What's up?
Why are you so happy?
I just love boxes so much.
Can I have one to take to the car?
- It's heavy.
- I'm fine.
Oh, okay.
We can go together.
That's fine.
I-I like quality time.
- Oh, you should go get your phone.
- No, no, no.
Let's just get this box down.
- Okay.
- Hey, can someone grab my phone?
What if it's about your booming model business?
-  Hello?
- Cece, you're pregnant!
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant!
- Who the hell is this?
- Cece's pregnant?
Sorry.
I-I'm Aly, Winston's fiancÃ©e.
Cece is pregnant?
- Winston's married to Cece.
- Winston Bishop.
Cece's pregnant.
Cece's pregnant.
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant, everybody!
- Oh, my God.
-  No need to yell.
Tell Cece to call me.
Got to head back down in the mine.
Hey, can we hustle?
I got a hair appointment in an hour.
It's a real upstairs, downstairs kind of day.
Gotcha.
What, Winston?
I'm using social media.
Oh, my God, Schmidt.
Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be a papa?
No, no, no, no.
What do you mean, "papa"?
What are you talking about?
- Pull the plug.
- Sadie told Aly that Cece is pregnant.
- Pull the pull the plug.
- What?
Why would she do that?
- 'Cause she pregnant.
- Winston, he doesn't know.
Oh, oh, oh, no Ah No I messed up just now.
W-Winston.
You weren't supposed to know that, so don't know that.
- Is that true?
What's going on?
- Hey, Schmidt.
It's Jess.
I'm so sorry.
I picked up Cece's phone, it was Sadie, and she told me the news, and now everybody knows but Cece.
So I'm gonna send her home.
Okay, okay, but Jess, um Plea  Is it true?
Yeah.
It's true.
Just get home.
She needs to hear it from you.
Miracle of miracles!
Finally got a parking spot.
Why y'all just staring at me?
Just really happy you found that spot.
Man, people wait their whole lives looking for a spot.
Thank you.
And here, you've been blessed.
With a spot.
Okay, so I do have a few changes.
Take or leave.
What if we kill off Jessica Night in the next book?
What?
I was thinking that she could be Schmith's next victim.
We could do it in a big way, like, he drops a piano on her head.
-  Done-zo.
- What?
Maybe she takes a baseball right to the face.
Batter out!
- Have you ever done this before?
- Yes, actually.
I published the entire Bitch Witch series.
Bitch Witch Christmas, Bitch Witch Prom Night, - and Bitch Witches of Rhode Island.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Look, Nick, I-I get that you're afraid to make changes.
Actually, I'm not afraid.
- Okay, then you'll think about it.
-  No, I'm not gonna make those changes because those-those ideas are really bad.
- Well, I - Jessica Night is the whole reason Pepperwood gets out of bed every day.
Schmidt?
!
You were right!
Schmidt?
Uh, he had to go, but he left the name and number of his favorite Uber driver, uh, Beezus "The Man" Tequito.
All right.
Mr. Beezus.
Mr. Schmidt likes to party.
You like to party?
Oh, very cool lights.
But, no, uh, Beezus, I I don't like to party It's not the first time I've heard that.
I'm gonna go see a girl.
- Oh, good for you.
- Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
Sure, yeah, that could be inspiring.
Hot cross buns Hot cross buns One a penny, two a penny Hot cross buns Second chorus.
Hot cross buns Yeah, I cannot believe Schmidt likes this.
Good when they're old But eat them when you can They're not as good when they're cold Hot cross buns   Last box in the truck.
Mm.
I haven't seen this room this empty since Steve left.
Who's Steve?
Oh, he was the guy who lived in this room before Jess.
Real night screamer.
He couldn't sleep unless he was screaming a whole bunch.
Yeah.
Oh, I guess I should give you my keys.
Are you really not gonna tell Nick how you feel?
- That's such a Steve move.
-  Steve was in love with Nick?
Oh, yeah, and he never told him.
That sweet, gay coward.
Maybe Steve left this place and-and and finally got the space that he needed to become a better version of himself.
Yeah, I mean, he's selling tires in Little Rock.
Okay, well, forget Steve.
Look, I know I'm being a coward.
Jess, I know you.
You can't walk away without talking to him.
This is how I have to move on, and I have to go.
- Let's get on the road.
- Okay.
Wait.
VAN : You've reached Van.
Leave a message.
Hello, Van.
This is Winston Bishop.
I'm your son.
I'm calling to tell you that I am getting married to the most amazing woman in the world.
And I turned out pretty great, too, so, um call me whenever you're ready.
Oh, also, I have a cat.
He's not ready to have a relationship with you, so just don't try to force it on him.
Yeah, so now it's your turn.
Be brave.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Hey, babe, I'm back.
Whew!
What's, uh what's happening?
I'm pregnant.
- What?
- I mean, you're pregnant.
We're pregnant.
Sadie called you, and-and Jess picked up, then she called again and Winston picked up, Winston told me.
It's an upsetting scene, but, um, we're having a baby, Cece.
I wanted to buy you flowers, but I couldn't pick out which ones, so We're having a baby?
We're having a baby.
: We're having a baby.
I really didn't think it was gonna happen for us.
It's a caramel miracle.
