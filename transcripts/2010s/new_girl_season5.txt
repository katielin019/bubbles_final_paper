{START OF EPISODE 1}
Last spring, I knelt, as I do now, and altered both of our lives forever.
And ever since then, I'm sure you've been wondering when I was gonna make this part official.
Nicholas Miller, will you do me the honor of being my best man?
Oh, hey.
I'm glad you're up.
I've got something important to ask you.
- I'm ready.
- Would you Hold on a second.
I need coffee.
Here's one.
Aw.
Thanks.
Mmm.
Mmm.
This just all feels so sudden that, uh - I don't know what to say.
- Just say yes.
Well, I want to say yes.
I really do.
But I'm sorry.
I'm just not there.
I think that you are there.
But I think it scares the hell out of you.
In my heart, I don't know if I'm your best man.
Nick I need you to get there.
Do you want to be my maid of honor?
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Blindsided?
!
How the heck you gonna feel blindsided?
!
We've been best friends ever since college!
Are you snickering?
Za-zam!
Was it worth it?
Oh, it was worth it.
Would've paid double.
All right, get up.
You stupid bastard.
Come here.
Of course I'll be your best man!
All right!
These rings are the first of a dozen accessories that are gonna unify the bridal party.
As you can see from my preliminary vision board, our wedding will borrow equally from the holy trinity of Liz Taylor, Jackie O and The Power Gays.
- Oh, I'm scared.
- You should be.
Guys, look at us.
A year ago, we were spinning around like cows in the movie Twister.
Now look at us.
You guys are engaged.
You're a minority owner of the bar.
I'm the maid of honor who's made of honor.
That joke works better on paper.
- Yeah, probably.
- And this guy is the cop who freaking saved a freaking kid's life.
Help!
- I'm stuck!
- Hey!
Help!
Thanks, Officer.
- Call an ambulance.
- I feel fine.
For me!
You know, Channel 4 is calling me the Carport Hero.
I just I just really hope it sticks.
It's not a big deal.
This is our year.
The Chinese zodiac says it's the Year of the Monkey.
I say it's the Year of Us It's the Year It's the Year Of Us Us Thanks so much for your help, Jess.
She is she is alarmingly in the dark.
Maybe it's a cultural thing.
You know, we saw the British coming.
India did not.
Are you nervous to meet Cece's mom?
No.
Cece said her mom is really excited that her sexy little bronco has finally met a cowboy that can tame her.
Paraphrasing.
And I'm really excited to meet the woman that Cece came out of.
Not paraphrasing.
I like your confidence.
Meeting Big Mama P is huge.
Her approval means everything to Cece.
Mom, this is my new friend, Jess.
Secretly, she's a romantic, 'cause she used to be a Bollywood dancer and Mr. P's parents forbid them from marrying.
Hot.
Continue.
When they saw her perform, they were so moved, they gave their blessing.
Dance can be so powerful sometimes.
Ugh, don't I know it.
That's why I booked L.A.'s premier Bollywood dance troupe, - MaHotMoves Gandhi.
- MaHotMoves Gandhi.
She's gonna love you.
I gotcha.
Okay.
I'm gonna go check on the best man.
I'm sure he's handling whatever task you gave him just fine.
He's so bad at everything!
Look, he's just one of those rare heterosexual men who does not have a knack for wedding planning.
I'll never understand men like that.
I can't pick up Cece's mom from the airport!
It's too much pressure.
You said I only had to do the easy best man stuff.
You're picking someone up from the airport in a car.
Not outer space in a canoe.
It is easy, Nick.
- Then why don't you do it?
- I can't pick her up.
Tonight is one of the most important nights of my hair's life, and I need a shampoo.
Not a cut.
They'll try and cut it, but I won't let them.
Getting a day-of cut would be insane.
Unless, of course, Julian's working.
Julian won't be working though.
You keep fireworks in your car?
What are you, a little Chinese boy?
- He's your carport hero, baby - Carport hero, baby - He can take away your pain - Stand by you forever He can take Your breath away.
Stop treating me like this, okay?
I'm no different from anyone else.
Officer Bishop, it is an honor to live in your building, sir.
That's Glen, too, man.
Glen hates everybody.
Glen flips off kids.
Guys, look, quit it, okay?
you're treating me like I'm special, and I'm not.
It's me.
Winnie the Bish!
The Bish with the wish!
And my wish is to have fun!
Which is exactly why I'm not gonna confiscate the fireworks behind your back.
Yeah, you got me, Officer Bishop.
You can have it.
I also want you to have this Jesus wig.
- You know, wigs aren't illegal.
- I know.
But I think it would look awesome on you.
- So do I. - Put it on.
Fine.
- Whoa.
Whoa!
- Whoa.
Whoa!
- Beautiful!
- Winston, you look so handsome.
- Oh, my God.
- It looks even better than I thought.
Flight 262 from Mumbai, your luggage is now arriving at baggage claim 2.
Yes!
Yes!
- Take five.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.
So, I just got a voice mail from my mom, 'cause she is at the airport.
Did you did you fly her in for the party?
Yes.
Yeah, I did.
It was supposed to be a surprise, but Are you so happy?
Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, it's just um - Hey, Nick.
Hey, Jess.
Guess who did it.
Me.
I got Cece's mom.
I was even on time.
Really?
You can speak with her?
How?
What are you talking about?
No, Jess, I-I need to talk to you now.
Um, okay.
I got to go.
Jess says hi!
Do you prefer the windows down or the AC?
Wow, you look just like Cece!
Yeah.
It's amazing, yeah.
I own it myself.
White zone is for the immediate loading and unloading of passengers only.
What is going on?
Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.
Jess, I haven't told my mom that I'm getting married.
Okay.
Okay.
It's gonna be fine, 'cause I'm your maid of honor, and I will be there with you tonight every step of the way.
'Cause this is the Year of, of Oh!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Jess!
Oh!
Oh!
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
The doctor said I'll be good as new in no time.
I know I don't look like somebody who should be questioning somebody else's judgment, but maybe you should have told your mom you were getting married.
I know.
I'm just so worried that she is not gonna like Schmidt.
And then she won't give us her blessing which would kill me.
Oh, she'll love him when she meets him.
Schmidt is not exactly what my mom had imagined for me.
You know, she wanted someone maybe not so white?
Oh, he is so white.
Remember when the power went out, and we put him in the window to keep the planes away?
What is Schmidt gonna think when he finds out?
We are gonna get her blessing, or I'm not your maid of H. Those stairs may have broken my body, And with that, I rise.
Honey, you're not You just need to Yeah, relax.
Okay.
You definitely can't go to this party.
I got to go and tell him.
I got to go tell him before she gets there.
I'll call Nick, and I'll have him stall her.
Okay.
I don't think I can.
You have no idea how anxious this woman is to get to the party.
No, no, no, I told you, we're not there yet.
You got to stay plugged in.
You're such a pill.
Well, just take her to the mall, get her some soft serve.
Be sure to save your receipts.
I'll reimburse you from the party fund.
Got to go.
Mrs. Parikh, can you keep a secret?
I'm going to kill this soft serve nonsense.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna play laser tag!
What are you doing?
!
We're gonna play laser tag!
It's a fun American game!
It's a fun game!
Groomsmen!
Yeah.
Mmm.
Ah.
Love each and every one of you sons of bitches.
Now, who are you?
I'm Groomsman Number Two.
Big Schmidt, Schmidt's cousin.
I'm Robby, Groomsman Number Four.
I am the ex-boyfriend of the bride, and a weirdly close friend of the groom.
I'm Number Five, J. Cronkite Valley-Forge.
CFO of Associated Strategies, LLC.
I'm 62 years of age, was recently widowed, and I believe earnestly that if we can all work together this wedding season, we will get more boom-boom than a TNT factory.
Yeah!
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for your time.
I have a brief statement from G3, who could not make it here tonight.
It says, "Dear Jess, I can't fly in for every damn party.
"I will see you at the wedding".
If you know Coach, that's exactly how he - "Wedding".
- Yeah, yeah.
And then he always goes, "Coach".
Now, me, myself, I am Winston Bishop.
Officer Winston Bishop?
The Winston Bishop?
The Carport Hero?
I knew it was you.
I saw you on TV, man.
Officer, you make me want to be a better man.
I'm gonna stop, uh, peeing in my ex-wife's mailbox.
No, seriously, everybody, calm down.
Act normal around me.
I'm a fun guy.
I do pranks.
Uh, Cece's last wedding?
The badger that fell down and almost killed a bunch of people that was me!
I'm Prank Sinatra, baby!
Old Brown Eyes.
Ain't no prank like a badger prank, because a badger prank got badgers, and it's dangerous as hell!
Ms. Parikh.
Who are you?
Oh.
My goodness.
Of course.
I must be completely unrecognizable to you from the countless photos you must have seen.
In honor of your visit, I stood the humble recipient of a professional shampoo.
So you're the man who's marrying my daughter?
Sure am.
No wonder she didn't tell me that she was engaged.
Oh.
Oh, no, then.
I'm assuming she was afraid I would disapprove.
- But now that you've met me - I disapprove.
Strong disapprove.
Let's take a moment to applaud your daughter's instincts.
No, no, no.
Look, Schmidt.
Mom.
I'm sorry.
I can explain everything.
Presenting Cece's mom!
- Except for that.
- I'm her mom.
- You're her mom?
- That's my mom.
- Then who are you?
!
- Not her mom.
That's her mom!
A dumb little boy you are!
Yeah.
Hello.
So, does Cece's mom love Schmidt, or what?
Which Cece's mom?
The real one or the one I may have kidnapped?
Th-The real one?
Anything for Officer Bishop!
The Carport Hero!
Thanks, Glen.
Sorry to army crawl into your home like that.
We come from a country of 400 million men.
Let's say half of them are no good.
Another half, very ugly.
That's still 100 million eligible men.
Sure, ten percent are gay.
Puts us at 90 million men.
Ms. Parikh, I love Cece.
Cut it in half again just for fun.
- Cece, when were you gonna tell her?
- I'm sorry.
On our wedding day when we were standing beneath our custom hybrid mandap-chuppah?
I'm so sorry.
I just I wanted the moment to be right.
I'm sorry.
We meet again.
Hello!
Is anyone here?
!
Jess?
Winston!
Oh, thank God!
I need your help.
Hey, Jess, let me ask you something.
Uh, I'm a fun guy, right?
I mean, I have a way about me.
Winston, look at me, look around.
Does your thing seem important now?
You're the Carport Hero.
Now I need your help.
No more Carport Hero!
Tonight, I'm Prank Sinatra.
No.
No!
You didn't play a prank You are the worst prankster in the world!
Every prank you do turns out either too big What is it?
Did you register me as a sex offender?
or too small.
How'd this blueberry get in here?
I don't You should have saw your face!
He did not see that coming.
Just like no one's gonna see what's coming tonight.
Nothing should be coming tonight.
I'm sorry, Jess.
The fuse has already been lit.
The lion has spotted the gazelle.
The doo-doo is already mid-flight to the fan.
The silly hounds have been released.
I repeat: the silly hounds have been released.
Just take me to Cece and Schmidt, please.
I did a prank.
I did a Oh.
I hope the scooter fits in the elevator.
There's an elevator?
I'm trying to find out where to return you.
You have pepper spray?
Why didn't you use that on me?
All right, I'll talk to you later.
Well, Cece's mom hates me.
Like Jay Z, I have 99 problems.
But unlike Jay Z, I have zero caveats.
I know, and I'm sorry.
Okay?
I'm sorry I screwed up my easy job.
And stop being so mean to me, or I swear to God I'm gonna fall in love with you!
Where you going?
Come back.
Let me make it up to you.
I know that I said I wanted the easy job.
But screw that.
I'm the best man, Schmidty.
I want the hard jobs.
I can handle it.
So what do we got?
What do we need?
We're past hard at this point.
We're well into impossible.
It's an unfixable situa Schmidt, I did not just drive to watch you give up.
Especially not In the Year of Us.
Look at yourself.
Look around us.
- Maybe this isn't our year.
- I have a plan.
And whatever it is, I'm in.
I got this guy's back.
Don't think we actually need - I know, but I'm in, is what I'm saying.
- That I mean Whatever it is, I want in.
- Okay, whatever.
- I want in.
- Schmidt, how important is this to you?
- Have I made that clear?
- That I want to be, like, a third.
- You can be in.
You're in.
- You're in.
- Thanks.
That's all I wanted her to say.
Are you willing to do whatever it takes?
Of course.
I also didn't love the tone that, like, "I'm in, but who cares that I'm in"?
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your attention please?
I'm Jessica Day.
I'm the maid of honor, but when I fell down the stairs, I wished I was made of rubber.
Uh This one goes out to the secret romantic in the audience.
Just a little reminder that love conquers all.
Follow me, follow me.
Follow me!
Think they're all really friends?
You know, I mean, when the dancing day is done?
Hey.
That was great.
Fantastic.
Wonderful.
Where'd she go?
Mrs. Parikh?
Please, wait.
Stop.
Look.
It was my idea.
I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.
You really think a dance is all it takes?
Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.
Or what I imagined.
I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.
None of us did.
Quiet, Chair.
But I love him.
He makes me so happy, and I'm gonna marry him.
I will not give my blessing.
Cece, Schmidt Oh, God.
Crunch.
Ah Shoot me.
You have my blessing.
You have my blessing, too.
Mine, too.
Oh, come on, Not-Cece's mom.
That would've been awesome.
It was a natural three.
You got to finish.
We'll get her on board.
I promise.
Oh, she's gonna get hers.
No, no, Winston, no.
What did you do?
No pranks.
Such bad timing.
Hey, Mrs. Parikh.
Check your shoe.
Tickle foot!
I put a feather in your shoe!
Too small, dude.
Way too small.
I've revised my vision.
Honey, without my mom's help, I don't think we can afford to parachute the rabbi in.
Well, that's why I've pared it down to only the things that matter.
That's great.
We can throw a wedding on a budget.
This is our year.
We can do anything.
Now, who's gonna take me to the john?
- Not it!
- Really?
- You're the only girl here.
- I can't.
It hurts my back.
Who keeps giving her juice?
You're in a senility scooter; use a diaper!
And it took a long time To find you But I finally found you.
That's a good tickle.
Oh.
Easy, Winnie.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
And, uh, one last signature here.
Congratulations.
We are official part owners of the bar!
- Ah!
- Yes!
Sir, we won't let you down.
I'm just a notary.
Hey, the note arize.
All right, we're not gonna let you down.
It's gonna be a little weird, you know, me working for you.
No, no, babe.
We're gonna keep it separate.
Ass-Strat's my day job.
I'm more of a show-up-late-night with-my-Argentinian-friends type of owner.
- Nick's in charge.
He's got it.
- Okay.
Look, it's all about finesse.
Watch.
The trick is, is you get super close, but then you pull back.
Watch how Daddy does it.
Oh, no!
Thank you for the back pat I needed that.
What?
- Well, you have to have beer on the bar - Uh-huh.
because that's what makes it stick.
So now I can do it a billion times on it.
Don't count that first one.
- Don't count that first one.
- Okay.
Hey.
Look at that.
What a game, right?
Screw the boss?
Oh, wait.
That's you.
- It's up to you to take charge now.
- Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm the manager.
What you need to do is set a meeting.
Establish yourself as a leader.
Within every man there is a man ager.
What's-what's going on there?
What do you mean?
Your ribcage has give.
You know, KC still hasn't texted me back.
I've been on five dates with her five dates, and I still don't know where I stand.
New relationships are so hard!
They take so much work.
So much work.
It's like it's like making a risotto; a risotto in your heart.
- Mm.
- Oh.
Aw.
What's that for?
Just 'cause.
- Aw.
- Mmm.
How great is that?
- So great.
- So comfy, so warm.
Like a port in the storm.
I just want to skip all the first dates, and just get to this.
- Mm-hmm.
- You're gonna get there, okay?
You just got to got to keep yourself open.
Wasn't Sadie gonna hook you up with, uh, that guy?
Oh, yeah, Fred.
He invited me to watch a movie at his house.
During the day.
Doesn't that make it sound like he's a boy who's allergic to everything?
You're looking for something wrong.
- I got to say, she's right.
- Mm-hmm.
And besides, what if he's got a dope-ass home theatre?
Damn!
This is a dope-ass home theatre.
I'm gonna hit the bathroom real quick.
Okay.
Well, hurry back before previews begin.
That was a joke, 'cause I feel like I'm in a real theatre here.
I mean, this is amazing.
Thank you.
Thank you for inviting me.
- Oh, that was fast.
- Hi.
Didn't mean to startle.
Just wanted to know if you wanted some snacks during the movie.
I've just made a fresh pot of coffee.
We're Flip and Nancy.
- Fred's parents.
- Mm.
Oh.
Fred lives with his parents.
Now I see where he gets his looks.
And his house.
Guys, seriously.
I'm not I'm not hungry.
You can't watch the movie on an empty stomach.
Hey, cool your jets until you have some of our coffee.
Beans are from Portland.
Oh, that's funny.
I'm from Portland.
Do you know my last book signing was at Powell's Books?
- Oh, no way.
- You're-you're a writer?
Well, I'm just a fool with a few stories.
Oh, you're just being modest.
- And you are being lovely.
- Oh!
You guys are so sweet together.
That's because we're still on our honeymoon.
- Feels like two to me.
- Oh.
- Feels like one.
- Like we just met.
Nick, what are we doing here?
Yeah.
Each-each of you know me.
Yeah.
If you don't, my name is Nicholas Miller.
I'm an American from Chicago.
I'm your new boss, so, you'll do what I say.
When the cave people went to the cave bar, and they asked for a drink on the rocks, they actually meant it.
Now that we're all laughing It says, "Wait for laughs".
I Anybody have any questions?
I have a question.
Please.
Anything.
Your mother.

I love it.
Thank you for breaking the ice.
I know!
I must look so stupid.
"Hey, get over here.
I got a meeting".
What an idiot, huh?
It was that bad, huh?
No, Birdman was bad.
This this was a disaster.
I'm here to help you, okay?
Look, I have over nearly ten years of experience in the corporate world.
What's "over nearly ten"?
"Nearly ten" would be eight or nine years.
I have I have over nine years.
That's different, yeah.
Got you a tie.
Corporate 101.
Dress better than your employees.
Reminds them that they're inferior.
I'd wear a tie, but only on my butt, like it were a tail.
A tail tie.
Furguson, you have a knot!
Is that salt water in here?
You been hanging down at the wharf again?
Guess what?
I took a chance with that guy Fred, and I'm in love.
- That's incredible.
- With his parents, but I'm in love!
Furguson, clear my schedule.
I need a word with your sister.
When Nancy was in Zimbabwe building clean water systems, Flip dropped everything to go over there and be with her, - and they put Fred in Tribal School.
- You seem like you're on cocaine.
Yeah, right.
Flip and Nancy and I hate drugs.
Okay, yeah, great.
What do you like about Fred?
Well, I didn't really get any time with him, 'cause Flip and Nancy wanted to watch the sunset.
Hey, do not talk to me like I'm some bastard who doesn't enjoy a good sunset.
But if you really want to be in a relationship Then I have to get to know Fred.
Ha!
You know what?
Tomorrow, I'm gonna just crack him open like a cold beer.
- You know what's a good date?
- Hmm?
Errands and a smoothie.
Okay, everyone, listen up.
Here are your new uniforms.
Oh, you got to be kidding.
- Aah.
- Save your groans for Birdman!
From now on, we will measure drinks.
- Oh, man.
- And we have a new one-napkin policy.
- Just one napkin?
- Questions at the end, please.
Should somebody ask you for a second napkin, you just say, "Are you sure"?
Nine times out of ten, they'll just back off and say "Thanks".
Now please go try on your new polos.
Can I have a word with you?
Hey, Schmidt, everything you just said makes me want to give you a wedgie in front of the others.
You need to rule with an iron fist.
No mercy.
You're not suggesting Cobra Kai rules?
I'm not doing it!
They're my friends!
Your friends are gonna lose their jobs if this bar goes under.
Ooh!
I never thought I would say this, but, give me the tie.
Now we're talking.
- No mercy.
- A corporate leader is born.
Don't-don't put it around your head.
- Well, hello to you.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Fred'll be right down.
You know, Nan and I are just packing up some books and paints for a park day!
- A park day?

Yeah, well, you look like a prince.
Now, go.
Go be a boss.
Hey, Cece.
Um, we measure our drinks now.
Am I right?
So, uh, do as I say.
Of course.
Use the thing.
Sorry, but, just, you know, it's important.
You know, with the consist Is this the exact thing that you wanted to have happen?
I wouldn't want to get anything on my new uniform.
That's, like, six shots.
So you have to charge That was some sass.
You're at a real crossroads, so, you know, this is a big moment for you.
There is no fear in this dojo!
Hey, Javier?
Where's-where's your shirt?
Oh, it's so crazy, Nick.
Someone broke into my house last night and stole that ugly shirt.
Yeah I don't believe that.
Oh, it's boxy on me, dude.
As your boss Javier, I need you to put your shirt on.
I need you to put it on your mother.
Hey, no mother jokes.
Javier, do not slide that right now, okay?

Let's walk!
I'm sorry, bae, you're gonna have to keep it separate.
Totally get it.
Love you, bae.
All right.
Let's go.
That was bad.
But can we just take a moment to appreciate Cece?
I mean, the effect that she has on people it's really incredible.
I can't believe she's marrying me.
I mean like, what?
Oh, boy, Furguson, this knot is getting worse.

- Join us.
Jess, a moment?
Jess, what the hell are you doing?
They're just the most amazing people I've ever met.
What happened to the one-on-one with Fred?
He's just so quiet I can't get a read on him.
Jess if you want a comfy, old relationship, you got to start somewhere.
All right?
Go spend five minutes alone with him, now.
Go get some cheese for the wine.
Chevre is always nice.
But I wouldn't dare tell you how to buy cheese.
You're being so assertive right now it's almost attractive.
Hey, not now.
Not the time.
You know I can be shy sometimes, too.
You don't have to be shy.
Seriously, I-I-I'd really like to get to know you.
Really?
Here's something that I learned from our relationship.
When you feel a knot you take a deep breath and you stare at it and face it without fear or judgment.
I don't think that it's Furgy's knot that's bothering you.
- Ooh.
- I think that the knot that's bothering you is right there.
Uh, wow, I, um I don't know where I stand with my girl, and I can't talk to her, because I am ashamed.
- Aw - Did he just say "ashamed"?
- Yeah, that's what I said.
- Ashamed of being beautiful?
Of being a man?
Of being passionate?
Hah!
Then I'm ashamed, too.
I say to you let her in.
Yes.
All together now.
- On the count of three?
Oh.
- Let her in.
- No counting.
- Let her in.
Okay, just go.
What a wonderful cheese store.
They had so many options.
That's good, 'cause I love cheese.
All kinds of cheese.
Orange cheese, pizza cheese I love all parts of pizzas, especially the dough.
Once I asked for a ball of dough, and they gave it to me and I took it to a park and ate it.
I'm so glad you opened up.
But then I realized I needed some sauce People always make fun of my eyes, - but I guess they're - Oh-ho!
Good!
Winston, can I have a moment?
Uh, yeah.
- I love Flip and Nan.
- I hate Fred.
- No!
- I know!
So Fred's not shy, he just sucks.
When I asked him what his favorite hobby was, he said, "Towels".
I've got to break up with that human pile of saltine dust.
I love Flip!
I mean, Flip taught me how to be vulnerable with KC, you know?
- Yeah.
- Nancy ear-candled me.
I can hear for miles.
Their relationship's just such an inspiration, and I want to be around it, but what can we do?
We ditch Fred.
Forget about that dude.
We establish our own relationships with Flip and Nancy.
Boom!
Make future plans with just them.
"Future plans" is redundant, - but other than that, I am on board!
- Okay.
Now, I'm gonna need some alone time with Flip and Nancy.
Can you stall Fred?
Can I stall Fred?
Of course I can stall Fred.
I would do anything.
I love Flip and Nancy.
Me, too!
Are we totally crazy?
Maybe!
I don't even care!
- I don't even care, either.
- Hm!
That's a vodka soda, I think.
Uh, it's close enough.
I hear you!
I'm getting to you!
Stop yelling at me!
- Shut up!
- I don't understand what Cece's doing here.
She led the walk-out.
If she's gonna be here, can she at least help us?
I am not gonna scab.
Sorry, bae, I cannot scab, but I'm here for you as your fiancé.
You are my rock right now.
Do you need anything?
No, I'm good, babe.
Okay, just let me know if you do.
We are screwed!
Hey!
Shut up!
I'm trying my hardest!
I shouldn't have fired Javier.
I got to apologize.
This is all my fault.
Obviously, this is your fault everybody knows that but a boss never apologizes; it shows weakness.
I feel like if Javier came back, the rest of the staff would come back.
- That's a great idea.
- I just said that.
Such a great idea.
Well, then give me one, because I said it first.
If you're giving it for that idea, if it's about that idea, then I deserve one.
But I don't want one.
And I felt left out.
Shut up!
Well, I wonder what's taking them.
Probably just the traff.
You know, the old 'ic.
"The old 'ic".
Anyway, I was thinking, um, is there anything you guys like to do that Fred doesn't like to do?
'Cause, like, I kind of just want to hang out with you guys and not Fred.
Hm.
Thank you for doing this, by the way.
This is great.
Slow night.
Just been driving around, mouthing along to hip-hop songs.
Miss Officer, can we go?
I'm very hungry, and my possible girlfriend and parents are waiting for us to order, and it feels like you've done over a million tests.
That's what I been saying!
Where is the justice?
You can go when I tell you to go.
Now, for your next test I want you to pretend you're about to break-dance, but do not actually break-dance.
I didn't mean Buddy, I'm talk - Why would he take that upon him - Don't ask.
I mean, whatever.
Man, he's dumb!
Give us more hands.
Do it more animated.
But less alive.
That's pretty good.
Keep all of that but pretend you're underwater.
Deeper.
Deeper.
- Okay, Jess, uh, what's going on here?
- Spill it.
Well it's just you guys are so amazing.
And it's really rough out there, and it's nice to be around something so great.
And I-I'm not really a love match with your son, but I think I might be in love with you guys.
Jess, we-we are glad that you think that - we're amazing.
And we think - Yes, we are.
- That you're amazing.
- Yes, we do.
And, um we know that Fred isn't the best.
We live with him.
You know, he can be so boring.
I-It's like the apple fell so far from the tree - Oh, God - it fell in a truck and then disappeared across state lines.
You guys are very honest.
Did Fred ever tell you that he loves model trains?
Oh, those model trains.
But he's your son.
- And we love him.
- Deeply.
And that's why we want to make a deal with you.
You and Fred equals you and us.
Wow.
Lo-Lovely home.
Look, Javier, we've-we've come to give you an incredible opportunity: for you to apologize and get your job back.
So, what do you say?
Okay, uh, well, Javier, let me tell you something.
Uh, I've been in the business world for just shy of half of two decades, and I can tell you that an opportunity like this does not come along often.
So Your boss is extending his hand.
Schmidt, stop.
Look, Javier, I'm sorry.
I messed up.
- Nick, don't apologize.
- I've never been a boss before, and it's weird, man.
You're my friend, Javier.
Remember when your cousin was in town and-and my cousin was in town and we kissed each other's cousins and then we peed on the ice maker?
Yes.
I remember that fondly.
So rough.
Look, we both chose the bar over other stuff.
I-I could've been a lawyer, and-and you were a dentist.
Were you, really?
You were gonna be a dentist?
- Endodontist.
- Look, it's my job to keep the bar open, but I still want it to be a great place to work.
If you come back, that'll be my top priority.
That and getting your old skanky cousin back in town, so I could make out with her.
And my skanky cousin back in town so you could make out with her.
So what do you say?
I say your mother.
- Your mother.
- Your mother.
- Your mother!
- Your mother!
No, your mother!
- Ah, you son of a bitch.
- I love you, man.
Oh.
You're the best.
Yeah, you guys!
Let's do it!
My h Next hand in, right?
N Okay, so you're saying that if I date Fred that we can all keep hanging out together.
Yes.
We don't want you to lose us or for us to lose you.
You're the child that we always wanted to have.
Imagine us as grandparents.
You think I haven't already?
You'll learn to love Fred.
And even better, you'll never have to go on a first date again.
Yeah.
That sounds really good.
There's no rush.
I mean, why don't we go up to the Vermont house in the next few weeks and all be together?
- Vermont house?
- Oh, yeah.
It's an 18th century farmhouse that we kind of refurbished.
- Gah.
Oh.
- We send romantic notes on the clothesline.
Oh, my geez.
And a loom in the barn.
Poof.
- Hey, there!
- Hi!
Right over here, buddy.
I am terribly sorry, you guys.
- We got held up by an overzealous cop.
- You know, Fred, uh, Jess was just saying how much she likes model trains, right, Jess?
I didn't know you were a railie.
That's so great.
What's your gauge?
Are you a G gauge?
Uh, G scale, Gauge one?
HO scale?
TT scale?
Probably not a tabletop girl, right?
Do you do it costumed?
Or do you just do it leisurely?
I deal mostly with the, uh, transitional era, post-Industrial Revolution.
I collect a lot of open-air coal engines.
I'm the president of my module group, actually.
We use horn hook couplers, so I'm kind of one of the best at scenery building.
Uh, just finished this beautiful sanitation depot, made completely out of balsa.
I also was the first to implement wire-framed humans so that the people are poseable.
Station agent is now Now he can bend his arm to say hello as the train passes.
There's one little girl I use I call her Sally.
I'm also quite good at flocking snow, so I'm very popular around the holidays.
Aah!
Stop!
Please stop.
I just, uh I ca I can't do this.
I can't believe I was even considering doing this.
I can't just settle down to settle down.
I really, really want you to consider what you're giving up.
Yeah, Terry Gross owns the house next to us in Vermont.
Oh, my God.
Do you run into her at syrup festivals?
We had a horse.
Until it ran away.
Its name was Daniel.
Daniel Boulevard.
I got to pick the last name, and I named him while we were in the car.
I have to go!
- Let's go.
- Hey, listen, Jess and I really aren't that close.
- I'm all about horses.
- We're going!
You know what, Nick, you were right.
A bar isn't just a place of business.
- It's a place for people.
- Mm.
Which is something I truly hate about it.
A bunch of bottom-feeders here.
Chum at the bottom of the ocean.
Yuck.
I know.
And that's why, as a manager, I'm thinking I have to fire you.
Maybe you should fire me.
What do you think?
You save enough money, buy me out one day, you run this place on your own.
- You really think I could?
- Yeah, definitely.
- I mean, your dumb bitch of a mother sure could.
- What?
Your-your mother, who, uh, we're referring to in this circumstance as a dumb bitch.
- I think she could probably - Wait, what?
Come on.
That's what you and Javier do, right?
C Your Uh, your mother, who, uh, you know, is a dumb is a dumb Is that not is that not how the joke goes?
I know.
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.
Um, can I have another napkin?
- Are you sure?
- Uh, yeah, I don't need one.
You know what, I know they turned out super weird and kind of like rich pimps, but I just kind of miss 'em, you know?
I'm glad they were weird.
Kind of snapped me out of it.
I was about one park day away from a Vermont model train-themed wedding.
Yo, Nick, you like my shirt?
It look like I'm naked.
Very cool, man.
- Right.
- Come here, man.
Hey!
Get out of here.
I'll catch up later.
Boss man's got - to go over the books.
- Okay.
Good to have you back, man.
Oh, this is very terrible.
I don't believe you.
Can you put, like, a jazz spin on that?
Look like an acorn.
Start spinning.
That's actually pretty good.
I just feel really bad for Flip and Nancy.
Shut up about Flip and Nancy.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.
- Please, I need you.
- No, Nick.
It's a right and a privilege.
In South Africa, they don't even have juries.
They have a-a judge and two assessors.
God, I would have bullied you as a kid.
Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.
Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?
Yeah, I would.
I've turned in some memorable performances in the past.
But it's just one day you'll be fine without me.
Now that Cece and Schmidt are engaged, she's here all the time, and her stuff is everywhere.
Okay, yes, she's a hot slob.
Ever since she got boobs, people stopped making her do stuff.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is not an excuse.
When I first grew boobs, people started handing me stuff, and I got messy, but then you got to grow up.
- Not the same thing.
- They're just boobs.
I promise you, tonight when I get back from jury duty, I will explain it to her in a way that she'll listen to, unlike your way, where she'll rip your dingle off and sew it back on your head like a unicorn horn.
She doesn't even live here.
She never signed our loft agreement.
She doesn't even know all the rules.
Hi.
Look at you.
You look so cute.
Thank you.
Love this top.
Jess, Nick needs to stop telling that wet pants story, okay?
- I know.
- I've heard it four times this week.
So I take a hot glass out of the dishwasher, I pour cold water into it, then the customer picks up the glass, and the bottom falls off.
- Oh, that's crazy.
- For real?
He looks down, and he goes, like, "Oh, my pants are wet".
I know, he-he needs to shape that story.
I don't know how you live with him.
He is the most obnoxious Knock it off.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Stop.
Stop it.
Knock it off.
Jess, are you cool with me hanging this groundbreaking poster of dogs playing poker on the wall?
Jess, please tell him that he cannot hang - this horrible painting.
- I really have to go.
I think it's hilarious they're playing poker.
Rather see a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger, mid-coitus.
Just straight up doing it.
Let's talk about the painting tonight.
Uh, do nothing till I get home.
Do nothing till I get home.
Do nothing till I get home.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
That's my guy.
Is it me, or is Cece really Messy.
Yes.
Dude.
I love it when we say things at - Same time.
- the same time.
Just just we're right there s R-Right there s - Wait.
- When we say things at the - same time.
- Same time.
Okay, now you're getting in your head again.
Just relax.
Remember the thing about Cece being really Messy.
- And we say things at the same - The same See, you're getting in your head because you're going quieter.
Just go with your gut.
- Isn't Cece really messy?
- This is fun.
Messy.
-'Cause we say things at the same time.
- Time.
- I'm done with you.
- I had it.
- Trying to get out of jury duty?
- Excuse me?
The way you're dressed, like you're in a school play about old people.
You want the judge to think you're crazy.
These are my real clothes, and I would never try to get out of jury duty.
It's not just a right; it's also a privilege.
And who are you to talk about clothes?
You're just wearing a blue suit.
Oh, call Milan.
Notice I'm not calling Milan.
Wow.
I'm sorry.
I actually agree with you.
Can we start over?
Can I buy your coffee for you?
- Herbal tea, and make it a big one.
- You got it.
Oh, excuse me.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Nick.
I just met the other only person in America who cares about jury duty, and he's a gosh-damn dreamboat.
Jess, we have an emergency.
Cece's washing her clothes, and I can't even get down the hall.
She's built a laundry dam.
- Well, can't you just step over it?
- No time.
You know I need to go straight from the bathroom to the kitchen.
It's a blood sugar thing.
Hey, Jess, it's your roommate Winston Bishop.
Isn't it amazing how a frame can elevate already great art?
Winston, don't hang that picture till I get home.
And I would talk to Schmidt about it, but it's like he can't even see the mess.
It's like he's love-blind or something.
Oh, man, I've never been this happy in my entire life.
I got to tell you, you guys, Cece and I just had shower sex.
Don't.
Did he just kiss you?
Why does he act like the Pope when he's happy?
I guess I'll just talk to Cece myself, and I'll tell her she's a disgusting beast, and she'll have to listen to me 'cause I'm the man of the house.
What?
!
No, no, no!
Do not talk to Cece.
Also everything you just said was offensive.
Everything.
Do not talk to Cece.
Ignore every natural instinct you have.
What's up, dude?
Hey, you mind if I steal Jess for a second?
Be careful.
The screen's cracked.
- You might cut your face off.
- Yeah.
Hey, Jess, I'm gonna give you to to Winston.
Uh I just have to step over the I'm not sure how I'm gonna get over the Here.
Just Uh, just here, come on.
Tell her I got over.
Tell her I'm okay.
Nick says he's fine.
Hey, uh, Jess?
If one were to put a hammer through a wall, what would one do?
I actually have to get going.
- Hello?
Je - Uh, I got to go.
Bye.
It was really nice to meet you.
Oh, nice meeting you, too.
Um, I'm Jess.
And you are?
Oh.
"Daniel".
And your phone number.
That's a cool move.
Yeah, it was a cool move, huh?
You disgusting beast.
Hey, Nick.
Did you leave your cereal out?
You need to clean up after yourself.
Shared living space, bro.
I can't do it.
Schmidt, I can't do it.
You can clean up the cereal.
Just go put it away.
Open your eyes, open your eyes to what's happening.
You already sleep in a mud dungeon.
Please Cece's a hot slob.
Cece, you're a hot slob.
- What?
- I'm sorry, what?
Look around, her stuff is everywhere.
It's disgusting.
Hey, Cece, you know what's fly?
- Love that hat.
- Cleaning's fly.
Cleaning's cool, dude.
Hey, everybody, I'm Cece Parekh.
'cause I'm so busy throwing them around, being fly.
Clean up after!
Let's get her, Winston.
- Am I right?
- Uh, you know I think we should just remember that we all make mistakes, um Don't get soft on me right now.
So keep-keep that in mind as we go forward with our day.
- I'm hard to live with?
- Yeah.
Because I got news for you you are so much harder to live with.
Hey, uh, guys, I-I feel like we're headed down a really unproductive path.
Yes.
Love some.
You tell the same story over and over.
"I've got wet pants".
We get it.
Bottom of the glass fell clean off.
It was a science miracle.
No, the glass was hot, and the ice made the glass contract, and that is why it broke; not funny the first six times, and not funny now, 'cause, guess what, Nick Miller - not always funny.
- No Whoa.
He's so funny.
You're so funny.
I'm You don't have to hold me back.
There's not a problem.
Say what you got to say.
You want to say anything else, say it.
- Not always funny.
- Say it to my face.
- Not always funny.
- Say it again.
- Not always funny.
- Say it again.
- Not always funny.
- Say it again.
- Not always funny.
- Say it again.
- Not always funny.
- Say it again.
So why don't we just sit down and and talk this out like adults?
I would love to, Schmidty, but where will we sit?
- Okay.
- Oh, perhaps we'll sit on this pile of uneaten carrots.
It's like I'm living with Secretariat, the horse!
He's hilarious.
- On the plus side, I'm being very witty during this fight!
- You know what, Nick?
Number 24.
Number 16.
Yes!
Sorry.
I never win anything.
Sorry.
Uh, uh oh.
Dr. Foster, is everything okay?
J.D.?
It ain't.
I decided I was gonna be Marcus the Meerkat, because, you know, you and I have remarkably similar body shapes.
Okay.
Um, what's the problem?
I fell and shattered my hip.
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.
How bad is it?
The, uh, paramedic described my left leg as a skin bag full of hip shards?
A skin a skin bag full of hip shards.
You're gonna have to take over my duties.
We are talking about the big job: acting principal.
Yes!
I'd love to!
Oh but my number just got called.
Well, that means the district's gonna be - bringing in Becky Cavatappi.
- Ugh!
They've been pushing her for my job.
She has fake zoomers.
What kind of message does that send to girls with growing zoomers?
I think she had her butt done, too.
Every time she runs, that thing sounds like an Indian rain stick.
I really want to be principal, so, um I'll be there.
Uh, I'll just have to, uh get out of jury duty.
I'll talk to you soon!
Sorry.
It's a tense situation.
So who should I call next to tell my story?
- I'm not cleaning till you get off the phone, Nicole.
- How about Patty's Pizza?
Smooth it out, smooth it out.
Oh, boy.
You are angry.
Winston, I need your help getting out of jury duty Jessica damn Day!
- I know, I'm a terrible person.
- Put Nick on the phone.
No can do, J. He and Cece are in it.
What?
I told him not to talk to her.
How bad is it?
Is Nick standing really wide-legged?
Is Cece calling him mean girl names?
Don't call me Nicole!
Okay, Nick-hole!
Yeah.
That's happening.
- Kids, huh?
- Yeah.
Is that Jess?
Jess.
It's awful.
I don't know what to do.
I'm sure Cece has her flaws, but I just can't see them.
And even if I could, what would I do?
How does a man stand up to the sunset?
Cece and Nick are basically the same person.
Both stubborn, hotheaded and brutally honest.
Oh, dear Lord.
- I'm marrying Nick.
- Duh.
Aw.
I kind of love that.
All right, what should we do?
Can't go to Cece's apartment.
Nadia's baby is teething.
Have you ever heard a Russian child scream?
All the time, in my Putin nightmare.
Look, get Cece to sign the loftgreement.
Nick wrote it, so he'll like that.
They'll both play hardball till they get bored, which will be immediately.
That's good.
- You've impressed me today.
- Oh, wait, wait.
Is that Jess?
- Hey, hey.
Give me the phone.
- All right.
- Hey, Jess, Nick-hole here -What?
Stop calling me Nicole!
I'm a boy!
Nick is calling everyone he knows to tell them this dumb story.
Hello, your friend is a pig person.
Guys, stop.
Hey, Chaz, I'm on the other line.
You're not gonna believe what happens to this glass.
- It's an incredible story; you're gonna freak out.
- Please stop.
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Put me on speaker.
Hold on.
Button's right there.
I know which button it is.
Now, what I'm about to say might shock you, but I need help getting out of jury duty.
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Well, well, well Look, I have the chance to be acting principal.
You don't know Becky Cavatappi, but she's a murderer.
What?
She-she's not a murderer, but I I really don't like her.
You can't just be going around throwing "murderer" on people.
Guys, I need to go in right now.
What do I do?
Whatever the trial's about, I say I don't believe in it.
Just tell them that your parents are Pakistani militants.
- That's what I do; works every time.
- Yeah.
Why'd you have an accent when you said "Pakistani"?
Because that's actually how you pronounce it.
"Pakazani"?
It's great seeing you guys work together.
You said it stupid.
I don't really want to lie.
It's kind of not really my brand.
You'll never see any of these people again.
There are no consequences.
Okay.
Uh, I gotta go.
Just remember you're a garbage person and you hate America.
I'm a garbage person who hates America.
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God?
The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me Gob.
Did did you just say "Gob"?
Did you say "Gob"?
- What?
- Yeah, she said "Gob".
Whose side are you on?
Justice.
This question is for potential juror number 16.
This case involves marriage.
I don't believe in marriage.
Excuse me, you don't believe in marriage?
As a concept?
Well, you know, you gotta keep the freeway open.
Uh, 'cause sooner or later, you're gonna get tired of the same cars driving down it.
Capiche?
Yes, capiche.
The two things that are ruining this country are marriage and democracy.
How refreshing.
Another person who wants to get out of jury duty.
I thought some people took this seriously, but apparently not.
Trial by jury is a pillar of our democracy, and yes, it is inconvenient.
But sometimes, sacrifice and civic duty are.
You don't deserve the honor of serving your country.
Maybe you should live in South Africa, where they don't have juries.
I know, I know!
They have a judge and two assessors.
Look, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean all that other stuff.
I'd be a great juror.
If you put me on this jury, you will not regret it.
That was an emotional moment, and I feel it would be best punctuated with a crash of that thing.
Nah.
The roommate loft agreement was formed in the year of our Lord 2005.
Hurricane Katrina had just decimated the American South, but we here, in Loft 4D, had gone through, well, perhaps in many ways a more horrifying Katrina.
- You can't say that.
- Can't say that.
A kitchen condom disposal clause?
That is not a relevant clause.
Not relevant?
I almost died.
Ugh.
- Winston!
- Yeah?
Stop having sex in the sink!
Okay.
First clause: "If a roommate has "five or more grooming products in the bathroom, "they must use a shower caddy "or pay an additional ten dollars in rent, adjusted every two years for inflation".
I currently pay an additional $11.97 in rent.
Okay, yeah, well, I'm not using a shower caddy, because I'm an adult woman and I don't live in a dorm.
Have you been to a dorm recently?
It's like a spa.
Those horny texters live like kings.
Nick is really damaging this negotiation.
Hey, speaking of damages, you know, what if we all pitched in to fix loft damages?
I don't know, let's say Nick broke something, like a wall.
I'll fix it.
I can fix anything.
Yeah, not according to the "Nick can't do electrical work" clause.
No, no, don't touch him!
He's electric, he's electric!
Hot!
Cece, you're the love of my life, but I-I kindly ask that you don't read ahead.
Okay, fine.
I'll use a shower caddy, okay?
And now that I've agreed to my thing, can we just agree that Nick can limit his stories?
You trying to take away my constitutional right to be hilarious?
Fine.
I won't use a shower caddy.
Use the caddy, I'll be less chatty.
It's hilarious.
It's undeniably hilarious that I just said that.
- Do you hear yourself?
- Great, we're in agreement.
Now just sign here, and we'll give you a key.
Give her a key?
I'm a little confused.
Is that really necessary?
It's like giving a squirrel a key to the park.
The park is always open, and the squirrel is there with rabbit, and squirrel and rabbit are there all the time.
So does squirrel need key?
What is happening?
You're dropping all your articles.
- I not!
- Now you're losing verbs!
So, are the squirrel and the rabbit they're friends?
Hey, babe, do not get concerned.
He's probably just tired or hungry, or getting jealous that I'm spending so much time with his best friend.
As a matter of fact, I am tired, and I am hungry, but the third thing is way off base.
- If you weren't a girl, - Uh-huh?
- I'd karate chop you in the mouth.
- You would get winded just trying to ball your fist up, dough-boy.
Well, good thing you don't need a fist for a karate chop, - you stupid idiot.
- You are such a door knob.
And if I wanted to karate chop you, you'd be dead!
Look at her flinch.
- This is good.
- So scared.
Shakey-shakey.
I literally have not moved.
I'm so not worried about you.
You want to go take a nap now?
Stop!
I can't listen to the two people I love most in this world fight like this.
Sorry, Winston.
Huh?
What'd he say?
Oh, no.
Schmidt, what did you do?
So, you are all serving on this jury.
This is a capital case and will last upwards of a month, and due to media exposure, you will have to be sequestered.
So go home, pack a bag, do not e-mail me.
The answer is yes.
Your hotel does have a pool, but is otherwise aggressively mediocre.
There, I banged the thing.
Okay.
I need a stapler.
You stay.
Hey.
Hey.
So here we are.
All right, Nick, I'll sign it.
I don't want to hurt Schmidt, and right now, he's probably just crying his eyes out at the Denim bar.
I really appreciate you keeping the store open for me late, Maurice.
That denim bar is like his temple.
He legitimately wants us to get married there.
- At a denim bar?
- Yeah.
Look, Schmidt and I are not gonna work if you and I can't get along.
Because you're Schmidt's family.
In a way, it's like we're engaged.
You're not my type.
I like them crazier and and sexually very prude.
- Oh.
- You just don't fit the bill.
Look, you don't have to sign this thing.
It's stupid.
The last page is just obscene drawings of cartoon princesses.
I saw them; you're very talented.
Thanks.
What they're doing is disgusting, but I think the drawings are nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.
Look, if I'm being honest, yeah, I feel a little jealous.
You know, Schmidt and I used to hang out all the time, and now we don't, and it's weird.
I mean, to be honest, I think I was a little jealous, too.
- Of me?
- In a way, you're always gonna know him a little bit better than me.
- Except physically.
- You'd be surprised.
Hey.
Schmidt, relax.
- We're good.
- Yeah.
- We talked, and everything's okay.
- Yeah.
- Thank God.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, easy, all right.
Okay.
- Okay, there he is.
Everybody's Whoa, mother, I'm right here.
Hey.
Are you hugging them while they're making out?
Yes, uh, that is weird.
Thank you for saying that.
Please let go of me.
I'm not interested in this.
Let go of me.
Did that wall fall down?
Just please don't leave again.
Yeah, about that.
Well this is it.
Since you won't be able to contact me for a month, I've left a complementary bowl of advice.
For instance, um, "Nick, stop doing that".
Just applies to everything.
That's what's up.
That's what's up.
E'r'day, e'r'day.
Nick, stop doing that.
That's what's up.
It's gonna be a long month.
I'm gonna pace myself.
I'm gonna miss you.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna keep them in line for you.
No, you can't hit them.
Even if it's for their benefit?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I got you a little something.
It's just to trade with.
It's currency in there.
I don't know.
Oh, that's so sweet, Nick.
Um, but you know I'm not going to prison, right?
As long as you're free right here, you're never in prison.
I bought you this burner from an unmarked storefront in Koreatown.
I believe it's small enough to conceal in the waistband of your underpants.
Oh, thank you, but It's four walls.
They can't hold you, though.
Make friends with big ladies.
Keep your head up.
Okay.
Make sure to put, uh, toilet tissue down on the toilet seat.
- Never sleep.
- Thanks.
Make your toothbrush into a shiv.
Everything's a weapon.
See, hate put you in there, but love gonna bust you out.
Don't be afraid to put two layers of toilet tissue down.
Let's do it.
Let's get into this and see what sage wisdom Jess has for us.
"No biting".
That's a reminder for me.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.
Ew, "No more poop pranks"?
Oh, yeah, those get out of hand quickly.
That was a disgusting February.
"If the shish kebob falls before I come back, Nick wins.
If it falls after, Schmidt wins"?
- Hi-ya!
- Is that Oh.
Check it out, shish kebob.
Check it out, yeah.
That's super gross.
"Schmidt's allowed to request that you do his back with sunscreen once a week".
Actually, can someone do that now?
It's nighttime.
"Boys' shorts should at most rise six inches above the knee".
- Yeah, but where does the knee begin?
- Right here.
You know, she never specifies where the knee should begin.
That's your knee, okay?
- This is the knee?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- "Stop harassing Beck".
- Absolutely not.
He cut you off on the freeway.
- That's for you?
- Yeah.
Yeah, makes sense.
"Tell Schmidt not to sing 'Rent' in the shower.
Five thousand, 2,500, 600 minutes - Okay.
- Those aren't the words.
"Stop reading this within the first three hours of my absence".
- Whoa.
- Holy mackerel.
How did she know?
"Because I know everything".
I'm just messing with you.
It says "Smile more".
Oh, that's - Oh - Yes!
- Damn it.
- Yes!
You're my slave for 17 days.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Opening statements today in the trial of celebrity chef Susanna Gabey, accused of killing her husband.
The special tonight: cold-blooded murder.
The jury is expected to be sequestered four weeks.
Ooh, look, that's her.
In this high profile case, initial courtroom reports note an annoyingly inquisitive jury.
In otter news, an otter was born - at the zoo today.
- Oh!
- Oh, dip.
I can't believe Jess is gonna be sequestered.
for so long.
Who am I supposed to go to for lady advice now?
I mean, I'm having - a real crisis with KC.
- It's not a crisis.
She posted a photo of another dude; it's no big deal.
Yeah, but when I asked her about it, she said, "He's a work friend, Winston.
Slow down".
I'm like, "Slow down?
"We've been dating for four months already.
I've seen one of your breasts".
What was the situation where you only saw one of her breasts?
We were playing dinosaur.
Look, I just need Jess.
Winston, it's gonna be okay, because I can help.
I told Jess that I was gonna take care of her boys while she was away.
What, you don't think I can be supportive?
No Todd is in town.
- Ploons?
- Are you kidding me?
Went to college with this guy.
He's the worst guy on Planet Earth.
His grandfather invented the springs that go inside pens.
He's got, like, a billion dollars.
Once he paid apl.
de.
ap from The Black Eyed Peas to hang out with him, just so he could look cool.
How much are you guys gettin' paid for this?
Bunch of marijuana.
And these carrots.
Ugh.
I just got a text from him.
"Nick the Dick" hate that "it's Hot Daddy T" hate that "in La-La Land".
hate that "Excited to talk "bachelor party with you.
Vegass"?
He spelled "Vegas" with two S's.
He spelled it with two?
That's ass.
That's Veg-ass.
You see what he did?
You see what he did?
It's so like Ploons to assume he's coming - to the bachelors party.
- He said Vegas?
You can't invite him, Schmidt.
On the other hand, you know, a bachelor party does cost a lot of money.
I'm your best man.
I got this bachelors party under control, buddy.
First of all, you're saying "bachelors party," which is wrong.
Okay, so where we going?
- Where are we going?
- Yeah.
- For the party?
- For the party, yeah.
We don't have to go anywhere.
You want to go somewhere, right?
- Uh - We're going someplace.
Someplace that is so much better than what Ploons could do.
Well, he'd go to Vegas, which which sounds awesome.
We're going to Tokyo!
I mean, look at you.
You're obsessed with Japanese culture, you wear the kimono, right?
I'm gonna take you where Ploons can never take you.
I'm taking you to Tokyo.
This this is pimp.
This is so pimp.
I just really need to know, um I was gonna say, how are we paying for all of this?
- Doesn't matter.
- How does anybody pay for anything?
No, no, seriously, how are we paying for this?
Boom, boom, boom Who cares?
We're going to Tokyo!
Is there a three-prong outlet in here somewhere?
God, I love echoes in bathrooms.
It's so good.
Hey, there's a stranger in the bathroom.
- That's just Brandon.
- Who the hell is Brandon?
Brandon's how we're paying for Tokyo, Schmidt.
You see, I put a thing online.
I'm renting out Jess's room while she's gone.
- Oh - I'm gonna rent out all the rooms.
Are you insane?
I don't think so, no.
Do you have any idea the amount of bodily fluids that people let loose onacation?
Brandon's a really good guy.
He's just here to finish his novel.
I appreciate the effort, I do, but we don't need to go to we don't need to go to Tokyo.
Not for this.
I'm not willing to turn our home into a public pool.
One: I understand your concern and I'll make note of it.
You're not even typing.
Two: I already bought the tickets and they're nonrefundable.
We need to come up with $9,000.
You don't need Jess's bowl of advice, Winston, all right?
I really do, CeCe.
I mean, look.
She's cheating on me.
KC's cheating on me.
- Hmm.
- The same thing happened with Daisy.
Everything's all good, then all of a sudden, she's hiding a basketball player in the shower and I own a cat!
I'm in a cycle.
I'm in a bad woman cycle.
She posts a picture with a hot guy, you post a picture with a hot girl.
That-that's great.
That's perfect advice, CeCe.
I know.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
If only I knew a hot girl.
Hmm.
Ah Trust me, it'll work.
I've done the math, and if we rent out every room for a month, we'll have enough money, we won't need Todd.
The hospitality industry is fast-paced and it's detail-oriented.
And you have the focus of a coked-up Italian on a summer day.
I'm very focused.
You're not even looking at me right now.
I thought I saw something shiny.
Um But no, it was nothing.
How do you drive your car and not hit people?
I have never been more focused in my It was a spoon.
I saw the it was just a spoon.
Nick, let's just call Todd.
Let's bite the bullet No, Schmidt, we don't need his money.
Look at me.
Okay Schmidty, I'm your best man.
And I may not be a rich man.
The only thing my parents invented was a wand to push the buttons on the microwave from the table, so you don't have to get up.
- You mean like a stick?
- My point is, it's my job to give you the bachelors party of your dreams.
And I intend on doing that.
Why don't you close your eyes for me?
What do you see when you see your dream bachelors party?
- Sushi.
- A lot of it.
Sake.
Honor.
And no Todd, right?
Look around.
Is Todd there?
'Cause we don't need him.
We can do this.
I want you to look at me and tell me you believe we can do this.
Do you believe, Schmidty?
Do you believe?
Schmidty?
Do you believe?
- I believe!
- Do you believe?
- I believe!
- Yeah!
I'm gonna eat sushi off my own ass!
Why you using tongs?
We don't use tongs at home.
Don't forget to write your reviews and it'd be nice if you mentioned Nick.
- So you're just full-blown running a hotel now?
- All right, let's go.
It's a boutique hotel, yes.
We are offering a premiere experience in a competitive marketplace.
Okay?
And the reviews are everything.
- So grab a vacuum - I'm gonna go take my 15.
It's not time for a break.
You just started working.
It takes a staff to run There's no work ethic there how do you work?
Look at that.
KC took the bait.
I gotta take my 15.
Uh, hello?
What it do, Jacques?
Everybody's taking their 15.
Got no staff.
Kumiko, how are you?
Hey, Kumiko.
Kumiko, you're from Japan, yes?
Well, you know, Nick and I are going to Japan.
Any tips?
Yes?
Cleaning.
She's talking about the shower.
- Oh!
- Yes.
- Let me help you with that shower.
- Okay, you just - stay there for a second, cowboy.
- Please.
We're running a business here.
We're running a hotel.
No sex with the guests.
You gotta focus, here.
Hey, you know this: I'm a businessman first.
- Yes.
- I'm a sex guy second.
- Okay?
- Stay focused, man.
- No sex, no Todd.
- No Todd.
- Tokyo!
- Tokyo.
Oh.
Thought you were Nick.
Well, uh, KC saw the picture.
Oh, great, you're welcome.
And she instantly broke up with me.
Oh.
Um I'm sorry.
You okay?
Yeah.
This is your fault.
I need Jess.
No, you know what, no, you don't need, you don't need Jess.
'Cause I'm here, and I've got this.
So what can I do that's Jess-like?
You want some, you want some tea?
- You want, like, cupcakes or a cute song?
- I need Jess.
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna do the tea thing.
How about I do the tea thing for you, and then I'll, it'll soothe you, okay?
So, how do I, how do you make tea?
How do you make tea?
!
I'll fig I'll figure it out.
I'll just get some water - and I'll ta - Yeah.
You know, it's Water and leaves!
- Water and leaves!
- Water and leaves.
So, this is hot, and this is cold.
Yes.
Wet down there.
Wet down there.
Oh, I don't need to know that, Kumiko.
That is, that is not my business.
Wet down there!
Oh, you mean down there!
Yeah - Yes!
- That's really Yes, that's, yeah, that's actually, yeah.
Let me get in the drain.
Sorry about that glass.
I was in the zone writing, and I just - It's just a glass, right?
- Yeah.
As a reminder, there's some plastic disposable cups, literally, right there, so there's no need to rummage through the cabinets with your travelers' hands.
- Okay.
- Okay.
But how's the novel coming?
Oh, I mean, I'm stuck on a love scene.
Ain't that always the case?
Couldn't imagine.
- Listen to this.
- What?
"As his electric car powered down, the first thing he saw was" No, look at me.
Look at me.
- Do I have to?
- Yeah.
"first thing he saw was her virgin breasts glowing "in the Alabama moonlight.
"She said, "'Which one do you want to see?
"The left or the right?
' "And I said, 'Both.
' "She said, 'No, pick one.
' "So I said, 'Left.
' "She finally showed him, "and it was as big as a Cadillac.
"She grabbed him by the potatoes and led him up the stairs.
"So many stairs.
"Left, right, left, "right, left, "right.
He grabbed the bannister and then let go".
Oh, that's erotic stuff.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're very welcome.
That's very sexy stuff you're writing.
- Thanks.
- The sexiest, really.
Where the hell have you been?
"The parakeet was still in the room, "but it turned out to be a welcome addition to the games at hand".
Lose that one?
I don't even get that one.
I didn't get that one.
Let go of it.
I have no emotional connection.
- You're cracking; take your 15.
- I'm not cracking.
Oh!
Nuts.
- You weak-handed moron!
- Hey!
Who also is our cherished guest here.
It's just the weight of it.
The liquid and the balance of it I'm so sorry.
- I'll help clean it up.
- No, please, let me clean it up.
You keep writing.
I think you're cracking.
You need to take your 15.
I don't need a 15; I'm gonna take a 15 more of work.
- You need a 15; take a 15.
- Pull it together.
I will not take a 15 ever again in my whole life.
I'm so sorry about this.
Take a 15.
"She took a 15 on my face".
Focus.
Focus!
Sorry about the little misunderstanding there, all right?
_ _ - This oolong tea?
- Yeah.
Yeah, well, Jess never gives me caffeine.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?
You know, this breakup has got me going crazy, Cece.
So you just need to calm down, okay?
I'm gonna need you to nurture me.
I'm gonna need you to nurture me.
Okay, all right, I can do that part.
Here we go.
So, um, maybe this breakup isn't such a bad thing.
- Mm-hmm.
- Now you can stop wasting your life and find someone more realistic.
Yeah, someone who's, like, in your league.
- What?
- Because you don't want to die alone, so you kind of have to settle and lower your standards and find someone that's just, like, in your lane.
What?
If you stay in your lane, you'll be happy, 'cause you won't be alone.
- Right?
- What are you saying?
Someone a little older, dumpier.
You are so bad at this.
For crying out loud.
Who do we give our laundry to?
The ad said it was included.
I suppose, I suppose me, uh, I guess.
- Here you go.
- Oh, dear Lord.
Where do the entertainment types tend to hang out?
Crystal is a performer.
We'd love to get her in front of the right set of eyes.
- This is all underpants.
- Showtime!
Mm No, oh, no, no.
Crystal!
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, honey, no acting.
I feel that you're gonna start a monologue of some sort, and I really don't want to hear it.
I have no tolerance.
Please, I'm begging you.
Is that your moment before?
Please don't do that.
You don't know what out of order is, - What the hell?
- Mr. Trask!
If I were the man I was five years ago, I'd take a flame thrower to this place!
Pacino, Scent of a Woman.
I got the referen Wait a minute.
Is that my cashmere window pane blazer?
I know it was you, Fredo.
You broke my heart.
Do you only do Pacino?
You knock him down.
Why don't you try knockin' me down now?
Rocky V?
No, no, in the ring.
Tommy Gunn only fights in the ring.
Of all the Rockys?
Baby, let's do the cop one.
Do Heat.
Don't do Heat.
I'm Oh, God.
'Cause she's got a great ass!
Nickolo.
What up, my man?
You got a weird vibe right now, bud.
I called Todd.
W-W You just say, "Hi, what's up?
- No.
- Don't come to the bachelor party".
No, I made plans with him.
I'm gonna invite him and ask him to pay.
- What?
!
You - I'm sorry!
Is she listening to Frasier reruns?
I'm in the middle of a fight with you.
There's this one episode, right?
Where Niles, he's making an origami flower, and Frasier comes in and asks Well, I'm sorry, actually, it's Daphne that comes in and asks Why'd you invite Todd!
Is that what Daphne asks?
'Cause if I'm Daphne, that's what I'm asking.
He sucks.
I could've done it!
Then what does, uh, Frasier say?
You would never be Frasier in this scenario.
- Who would I be?
- Obviously the dad, the lazy piece of dump that sits on the chair.
And you just broke my heart.
Well, the McQuaids sure left a mess.
Nick, I would just like to say that you had a vision for this hotel.
I'd also like to say that I may die alone.
- It could happen.
- Yeah.
- Be nice if you surprised us.
- I'll try.
Okay, look, Nick, I'm sorry that I called Todd.
You can suck Todd's gas till you're blue in the face, but I won't.
Not now, not ever.
I'll pay my own way to Tokyo, 'cause he hotel's still open, so Kumiko seems happy.
You could get some money back from her.
Yeah.
I ca I'm not gonna charge her; I can't charge her.
- What?
- Why wouldn't you charge her?
Why can't you charge Kumiko?
To be honest, because we had a sexual encounter.
There we go.
Shame, shame.
I knew it, Nick!
You weren't in the bathroom fixing the shower.
You were showing her the business center.
Okay, in my defense, it wasn't in the shower.
It was in the hallway for a few moments.
Don't refer to it as a hallway.
Yuck.
I literally meant the hallway.
And it was vibrant, if that's a word you could use in this situation, 'cause that's what it was; it was like - Just admit it, Nick, you screwed up.
- I did not screw up!
Well, you certainly can't charge her now.
Yes, I can.
Sure I can.
Hey, Kumiko.
Can I have a minute of your time?
I had a I enjoyed our special time today.
I haven't taken my pants off in front of a woman in quite some time.
I'm sorry that the pretzel fell out.
That was unexpected.
I honestly don't know how long it was in my underpants, and that was disturbing to me.
Thank you for not overreacting to it.
I'm here to talk about money.
American currency.
Our special time was not included, financially, in the room rate.
'Cause I'm running a business.
And I can't be soft here.
I understand.
I give you money.
Thank you for being so cool!
That's what Yes.
You are prostitute.
- Working boy.
- No, no.
I want sex.
You want sex.
But need money.
- Prostitute.
- Hotel owner.
Sorry, Winston, I mean, this is all my fault.
No, no, no, no.
No, Cece, you're fine.
You were right.
You really were.
I mean, KC and I were, we weren't going anywhere.
Let's be honest.
I just want to find somebody, Cece; I really do.
So bad it hurts.
From my head to my turd pipe.
That's sweet.
I got so much love to give, Cece.
I really do, so why am I always on the phone, getting dumped, crying my eyes out like an idiot?
Well, there must be something that you can do.
Well, you know, if Jess were here, she would tell me to: "Just believe in yourself, Winston, and, like, be positive".
Well, forget what Jess would say and forget what I would say.
What do you think would really break the cycle?
I just want, for once in my life, for someone to cry over me.
Right, okay, explore that.
Somebody to just cry because of That's a great idea, Cece!
- It is?
- Yes!
This is what I'm gonna do.
We're gonna make KC cry over me.
Oh, no, no, that's not, that's not where I thought you were going We're gonna make a girl cry today!
Couldn't take the money?
Thought you were a prostitute?
It's time for Todd.
Yeah, okay.
All right.
You ever taken gloves off before?
We could've paid for Tokyo, but a business venture went south and ultimately, it was my fault because the company was my baby.
I can't believe you guys have never been to Tokyo.
I've been there 28 times!
Where do you guys get your sneakers?
- 28 times?
- Yes.
And you idiots couldn't even figure out how to get there once?
Ha!
You know what you - deserve for that, Nick?
- What?
You deserve a one-nut slap, my friend.
You're not slapping one of my nuts, Todd.
- Oh, yes, I am.
- I'm an adult man.
Tokyo?
Get that leg up, come on.
- All right.
- Get that nut!
This is for you, best man.
We're going to Tokyo.
Yeah, get it up there.
Here we go.
- Ooh - Okay, no!
- S-Stop it!
- What!
?
- Get your hand out of here!
- Oh!
You're not slapping anybody's nuts.
Boo!
We don't need your money, Todd.
I'm gonna love my bachelor party, no matter what.
You're my best man.
We're gonna do this.
- Yeah, we can do this.
- Do it anywhere we want to do it.
- That's right.
- It doesn't matter.
I do, however, still owe $9,000.
Wow.
You guys are good friends.
- Yep.
- Yeah.
I don't have any friends.
No one likes me.
Ooh, why would you say that, Todd?
I have a terrible personality.
True.
- You're fake crying, aren't you?
- No I'm not!
I'm Yeah, all right, you guys caught me.
I see it in your mouth.
Look, there she is.
Hey, Winston, I am not doing this, all right?
It is the worst idea that I have ever heard.
Uh, remember when you said, "I'm Cece.
I'm super supportive"?
Now's your time to shine.
Yes, it isn't like a blank check, though.
This idea does not deserve to be supported, because it's insane.
Yeah, that's what I need, Cece!
I need insane!
Look, Cece, it's no big deal, but I need this more than I've needed anything in my entire life.
I don't want to KC, um I really wish I didn't have to be the one to tell you this, but Winston is dead.
Wait, what?
Yeah, uh Oh, my God!
Uh, yeah, he Oh, my God!
- You okay, babe?
- No!
Oh, the?
So you were?
Well, then, um, KC, you should know that Winston's last words, right before the truck - Oh.
- hit him were, um, "This is all KC's fault.
"And I wouldn't be dead if it wasn't for her".
Hah!
It's me and I'm alive!
He's alive!
- Scared this dude.
- I know.
- Hmm - Yeah.
What?
What is going on?
Thank you for this, Cece.
I needed this.
- Yeah, you're welcome.
- This means a lot.
Okay, but Winston, I need you, I need you to go.
Hey, guy from the picture Mm-hmm if that's your real name y'all look good together.
We out.
Bye.
- Wait, who?
- I-I-I Oh, my God, that was so messed up.
- You've changed my life, Cece.
- Uh-huh.
The cycle is broken!
It's a whole new day.
From now on, the woman I'm in a relationship with is gonna be crying over me!
That shouldn't be the goal, though.
You know that, right?
I want some ice cream.
Never tell anyone we did this.
Can we get some ice cream?
Well, whose stuff is all this?
Is Jess back?
Oh - Jess, what are you doing here?
- Huh!
Jess!
Hi, Nick.
Hi, Schmidt.
Hey, Brendan.
Cool vibe, Brendan.
Is this cute?
Mmm?
Polka dots?
Or don't go anywhere.
Yellow?
Mm-mm.
Wear the stripy one.
- Hmm - I think that will look nice with your face and everything.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- That's a good one.
That's nice.
You look pretty today.
Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Why are you putting spoons in the laundry hamper?
I'm hiding our nice stuff.
See, my cousin Bobby and Carol are coming in town, and they're gonna ask me for money, so I'm I'm trying my hardest to look poor.
You are poor.
Technically, yes, but I'm also the richest Miller in the history of our family.
I mean, I own part of a bar, I have a savings account.
I don't fully understand how to use it, but I do have it.
Nick, you're doing great; you really been stepping it up lately.
Calm down.
Thanks.
The other day The other day, I was at a restaurant, and they asked if I wanted avocado, and and I said, "Yeah".
And they said, "It's extra," and I go, "Shh.
I know it's extra, but but I want it".
Uh, Winston, you ready to go?
Born ready!
You know, believe it or not, you guys, I have never been wedding dress shopping before, so I didn't really know what to pack.
- Are those whistles?
- Yeah.
These are whistles.
Oh, I even got a pocket fan so I can blow wind in your face, and your hair could be all like this.
Pocket fan.
Cece, I'm begging you, just cancel the appointment and reschedule it for when Jess comes back.
There is a six-month waiting list.
Do you not want us to get married in June?
Oh, no, I want to get married in August, so I can walk down the aisle covered in flies.
You're so concerned about these flies.
- Please, go to the appointment.
- Look, relax.
All right?
Nick is the best man, Jess is the maid of honor, and myself personally, this is where I cut loose.
This is where you unleash the beast, all right?
Speaking of which, uh, Cece, did you bring your strapless bra, or should I get the booby tape?
Booby tape.
Uh, no, Winston, this is just a ride.
It is just a ride, okay?
Hey, guys, C-Cece, my cousins are almost coming!
Cece, hide your jewelry!
Winston, hide your jewelry!
All the jewelry!
Nick, this is insane.
Just tell your family that you can't give them any money.
Set some boundaries.
You're right.
Time for me to put my foot down.
- Put it down.
- I'm gonna say no.
- Yes.
- I'm gonna set boundaries.
No money for them.
- Hey!
- Hey!
Hey!
- Hey, how you doing?
- I thought I smelled fish!
- Oh, yeah, you smelled fish.
- Look at you, huh?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- What, are you working out now, huh?
- Yeah.
- Tough guy.
- Ow!
You doing yoga?
You doing yoga, huh?
Yeah, I do I've done, yeah.
I don't do yoga.
Oh!
Look at this.
Exposed brick, dude?
Really?
Oh, come on.
Yeah.
Yeah, I didn't build this.
You don't want to throw some carpet down over the hardwood?
Yeah, what's wrong with wallpaper?
- I love wallpaper.
I'd use - Don't forget about - who you are, man.
Look, he's getting weird.
- Yeah.
Welcome to Los Angeles.
Maybe we take a a-a-a, you know, a "cah" down to the "hahbah" and check out The "Mahtian" on the big on the big screen with Matt Damon in "Mahs".
Whose "cah" we taking?
Stop, Schmidt.
Hey, we got you a little gift, yeah?
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yeah.
Oh, I left it outside in the hall.
Well, go get it, you moron.
You're a moron, you moron.
I'm not the one who left it in the hallway.
Why didn't you bring it in if you saw it?
Because I didn't see it until now.
Yeah, 'cause you're a maniac, and you're controlling me - all the time.
- Oh, my God, I love you so much!
I love you, too, Peaches.
You're the best!
Regular Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, these two.
This is how it starts.
There's three stages to a Miller asking for money: okay, it's compliments, it's ply with food, and then it's go in for the kill.
- Be strong.
- I'm trying to be strong.
Seems like there's a space theme.
You guys like space?
Outer space?
Yes.
- Yeah.
- Ah, you didn't have to do this.
- I got it at the airport.
- Yeah.
Hey.
- There it is.
- It's popcorn.
- Oh!
- Yeah.
Comes all fancy-like in its own trash can.
That's too much.
That's too nice.
- No, come on.
- I love this kind of popcorn.
You're totally hooked up, brother.
'Cause you can mix and match.
- That's right.
- Easy.
Nick's not hungry.
- Oh, that's right.
- Is he your life coach?
- Thank you for the offer, but - Nick, eat the popcorn.
- He just ate.
- I just ate.
- Just one piece.
- Nick, it's popcorn.
- Do it.
Do it.
- I don't want it.
It's good for you.
It's corn!
You're trying to give me popcorn so that I give you money!
It's not gonna happen!
I'm not giving you money!
I'm setting boundaries!
Oh, Nicky, we don't want your money.
- You don't?
- No!
No, no.
We want your sperm.
What?
Yeah, we're trying to start a family, and Bob's army's down.
I need your troops to storm my beaches.
S-So no money?
- No.
- Just sperm?
- Yep.
- Don't tell anybody, all right?
Guys, this is excellent.
I got a lot of that.
If I had a dollar for every sperm, my room would be covered in dollar bills.
- Nick, a word, please.
A word.
- Right?
Right?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- A word.
Yeah.
Thanks for the popcorn, too.
One minute.
What's that guy, like, his manager?
Doesn't quite feel like the one, and it doesn't really feel like it's me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, it is you.
It is beautiful.
It has an attachment for a leash.
No judgments.
Wink, wink, right?
But it does.
Do you mind if I just take one minute to think about it?
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
Winston, I just asked you to drop me off.
- Sir, what is your role here?
- I am her friend.
My job is to protect her, so, please, cut the caca, and bring us some dresses with an A-line cut.
I may or may not have done an extensive amount of research on wedding dresses.
I never thought that I would say this, but I am really glad that you're here.
So you're gonna take his word over my word?
Show me some clavicle!
- I love it.
- I hate it.
I love it.
- I hate it.
- It's perfect.
It's imperfect.
Am I crazy to want a hat?
Forget the hat.
Forget the hat.
No!
That's the one!
That's the one!
We got dibs!
Schmidt, this is great.
They just want my sperm.
What about setting boundaries?
They're not just reaching into your wallet this time, Nick.
They're reaching into your skin wallet.
- That's your scrotum.
- I got it.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to veto this.
Yeah, well, you have no standing to veto.
It's my sperm.
You're my best friend in the whole entire world.
We've been through a lot together, so I just do feel like your sperm are partly my sperm.
Mi leche es su leche.
No!
No!
Nick, you've been doing so well lately.
- Thank you.
- Right on track with the plan.
My What plan?
What are you talking about?
I-I may have your entire life planned out on my computer.
I made a spreadsheet and everything.
I worked on it this morning.
You-You've got to be kidding me.
I don't It's not "Nick's Life Plan"?
What is that?
!
I'm just trying to keep you on track, Nick.
Look, we've always done everything together, and I'm just worried that we're gonna drift apart.
You know, I'm gonna get married and have kids, and you're gonna be wandering around the grocery store, holding a bottle of Scotch and an ear of corn.
Okay, you know what?
You know what I have to say to you, Schmidt?
Boundaries.
You know, you and me.
Boundaries.
All right, let's do this.
- We're having a baby!
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, my boobs are - gonna get huge!
- Unbelievable!
They're gonna be like, "Get out of my way.
Here come my boobs".
Yankees suck!
Yankees suck!
Yankees suck!
This really means a lot to me, man.
I'm sorry I couldn't do it myself.
Yeah, you know what I think it was?
One time, I got stung in the penis five different times by five different bees five days in a row.
What were you doing that your naked penis was exposed to bumblebees?
Why is he here?
You know, even though I don't approve of this, I would never, ever leave you in your time of need.
Schmidt, I don't want you here.
I told him I didn't want him here.
I can't be any more clear on that.
I botched it!
Botched it good!
Three strikes, and you're out!
How do you botch it?
You do not have my blessing.
I don't need your blessing.
I don't want it.
I don't care.
I don't even want you here.
Mr. Miller, we're ready for you.
Thank you so much.
Here I go.
- Nicky, give 'em hell, huh?
- Yeah.
- Get me a winner.
- All right?
You got it.
- All right.
- All right.
- Go get 'em, Nicky.
We believe in you.
Come on, make a smart one.
- Here we go!
- Yeah!
- Hey, Schmidt, can I have a - So you do need my blessing!
I don't need you!
Just please come back in here with me.
Thank you.
Never seen two guys so close like that, you know.
My dad and his and his friend Joe were close like that.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you got in my head.
You got in my head.
Why'd you have to tell me about the plan, Schmidt?
Now I need to know what happens.
Why am I not supposed to have a baby this way?
As I saw it, your first child was to be born between you and a small Italian woman.
Like a Maria?
- Yes, like a Maria.
- Okay.
She makes meatballs and soup, and does laundry in a wooden bucket.
- Yeah, she does.
- You guys have a child.
It's a boy.
I'm incredibly involved.
I give him the other half of a walkie-talkie just in case he ever has a question in the middle of the night.
Yes, I'm here.
He hides his broccoli in a planter during dinner.
I wink.
I look the other way.
- You mean e-broccoli.
- What?
'Cause it's the future.
How far in the future are you planning on having a child?
Well, if we're talking about me meeting a woman, falling in love and having a kid?
A very, very, very, very long time.
So many "verys".
And let's face the facts.
My love life is a disaster.
Schmidt, this might be my only chance of having a kid.
- Don't say that.
- I'm saying it.
And if I can't have a kid with a woman, then maybe I'll have one with my cousin.
Horrifying wording for what actually is, well, a beautiful sentiment.
I-I want to do this.
I want to experience this.
You know, and I know I won't be able to raise him, and and that's disappointing, but I'll still see the little guy at parties and such.
Say hi.
He'll say hi.
Give him some fireworks to pop off, or or e-fireworks.
Man, I'm just I'm getting excited just thinking about this.
Look, it's not how I originally planned it, but it's still another Nick Miller in the world, and I'll take that any way I can get it.
You have my blessing.
Well, it's embarrassing to admit, but thanks, man, I kind of needed it.
Yeah, absolutely.
You should get out of here, man.
I'm gonna go masturbate.
Okay.
We really got after it there.
I am so happy I could help.
Like, I don't want to be greedy about it, 'cause I know I've already put on the most perfect dress once today, and I should wait - You thinking what I'm thinking?
- I really want to put it on again.
- You should put it on again.
- I know!
Okay, I'm going to go try it on.
- Okay, try it on again.
- Okay.
Oh, no!
Oh, no.
What did we do?
What is this?
Oh, my God!
How drunk were we?
- No.
- No.
Okay.
You know what, no, no, no, no.
This is, you know what, this is, this is good.
Everything's all right.
I mean, look, you got mirrors.
You know, no one's ever done that before.
I like it, you know.
I like the Again, I can't talk enough about the mirrors.
Why is there a spot for batteries?
So the glass can light up.
We were really excited about that feature.
Yeah.
You look like a prostitute for wizards.
I look like a bullfighter in space.
I cannot get married in this dress.
Okay, so what do you need me to do?
Nothing.
I don't need your help.
Okay.
'Cause I'm just I'm gonna do it by myself.
Well - Yeah, well, no, I - You washed?
Yeah, of course I washed.
Hey, why the why the long faces?
Shouldn't we be celebrating here, guys?
Listen, we, uh, we talked to the doctor and, uh, turns out we can't afford the procedure.
Are you kidding me?
So I just masturbated for nothing?
You-you guys flew across the country.
You didn't think about any of this beforehand?
We did little to no research.
But we still want to have - a family, you know.
- Yeah.
We already fell in love with the little bastard.
Anyway, there is one other option we could explore.
What is it?
Anything.
Nick I want you to have sex with my wife.
- What?
- Yeah, we don't just need your reindeer, we need Santa.
- What?
What?
- Yeah, come down the chimney.
- Feet first.
- White Christmas.
Bring a sackful of gifts.
This is nuts.
I can't do this.
This might be your only chance to have a kid.
Yeah, but then I have to have sex with my cousin.
I don't want to have I don't want to have sex with my cousin.
It's not your cousin.
It's your cousin's wife.
That's like letting a dog drink water out of your mouth.
You know, it's not great, but it's legal.
The point I'm trying to make is, is I think I'd like another Nick Miller in the world.
- All right.
- Can you imagine?
Come on, man, what do you say?
I think the best thing to do here is to just look at this like a medical procedure.
Why is this guy in this conversation here?
Bobby, it's a losing battle.
Just move past it.
And, Carol, look, I don't want this to feel, I-I don't know, romantic.
I don't want you getting confused.
- There's a zero percent chance of that happening.
- Yeah.
If you're suggesting that I can't be romantic, then you're out of your mind.
Yeah, excuse me, Nick is very romantic, okay?
He does romantic things for me all the time.
Schmidt, what are you talking about?
Just the other week, you were very romantic to me.
When I fell down in the parking lot and you picked me up?
Get up, dude!
How was that romantic?
!
It was beautiful and it was kind.
You know, romance doesn't always have to be sexual, - you idiot.
- You're the idiot!
Don't.
Don't.
Honestly, you want to do this right now?
Give me one shot at that big head, I'm gonna knock you out.
- Dominated you physically.
Admit it.
- Yeah, defense.
Can we put something over the windows?
I want it to be pitch black in here, so I can't see I don't like the way you look at my body when you say that, Carol.
- Well - Okay, we got to keep it positive.
- I agree.
- I think what Nick is trying to say - Uh-huh.
- Is that he'd like to be completely naked.
- Where are you getting this from?
!
- Objection, Your Honor!
Strongly!
'Cause I will be wearing clothes!
- Overruled.
Yeah.
- Overruled.
- Yeah, stand down.
- But I'll-I'll tell ya, I'm not wearing a condom!
End of discussion.
Guys such a clearly great joke.
Because obviously I can't wear, - you know - Oh.
We got to loosen the vibe a little.
- Can we do something about this smell?
- Oh, yeah.
It is a little rank, yeah.
- There is an odor.
- Yeah.
Well, I lost a glass of milk.
You lost a glass of milk?
Was it full?
Yeah, it was to the top.
I could barely carry it.
Oh, that's outrageous!
- Oh, God.
- Now, if you don't mind, I'd just like to bring things down for a second here.
Bob, Carol, um, I originally bought this for Nick, but since he may never have someone to give it to, I'd like for you guys to have it.
- Mm-mm.
- No, dude, no.
We're Pats fan.
We hate the Bears.
- You don't like the onesie?
- Pats are number onesie.
Where did we land on me being in the room?
- Get out, Schmidt!
- Get the hell out of here!
Look, I-I know that you have a "no return" policy, but you have to take this dress back, okay?
I look like a rich person in The Hunger Games.
Yeah, I know.
I was gonna stop you from buying it, but I didn't, so we're done here.
Wrong!
See, you may be done with her, but you're not done with the law.
Winston Bishop, LAPD.
You're a cop?
The guy who was spinning around singing Patti LaBelle songs yesterday?
And you must be the one who was serving champagne without a liquor license.
We don't charge for it.
It's legal.
Uh, not if it's being served to a-a minor.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, that's right.
I'm 17 years old.
I'm a kid.
You're a 17-year-old police officer?
I'm a cop prodigy.
You see, my school is the streets.
But my other school is school.
'Cause-'cause I go to school.
Like a school-school, for learning.
You are so stupid.
No return policy is more important than the love that brings us here today, so This means a lot to her, so please help her out.
Well, that didn't work.
Look, Cece, I'm-I'm no good at this.
I'm no help.
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna take a backseat to the wedding.
No.
Look what you did in there made me realize how much you really care about me.
I know that you're already one of Schmidt's groomsmen, um, but I was hoping you would maybe also consider being one of my bridesmaids.
You want me to be a bridesmaid?
If you don't want to, I - Do you know who you're talking to?
- Yes?
- You're talking to Winnie the Bish!
- Yeah.
I would love to be your bridesmaid!
- Yes?
- Yes!
- Yes?
- Yes!
- Oh - Girl, you are under arrest for taking my breath away!
What's with this parachute top?
It's good for movement, hard to stain.
I thought it was appropriate.
Okay.
I don't know what you think we're about to do, but I'm keeping this very simple.
- I want to keep it simple.
- Uh-huh.
Great.
Should we should we just make love now, then?
"Make love"?
What, are we riding horses around on a beach topless?
No, thank you.
Just tip me over and pour me out!
Tip you over and pour you out?
Yeah.
It's that children's rhyme that's also very sexual.
It is not sexual at all.
It is in this case.
Carol, I'm g I'm gonna need you to be a little bit nicer to me, please.
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- I can't p Listen, I can't perform sexually if I don't feel a-at least a little desired.
- Okay.
- Could you give me any sort of a compliment?
Anything.
We'll go and then we'll just That will get me started.
I'll say something nice about you then and we can get into it.
Just one compliment.
Nothing on the front.
Can you turn around?
No.
Keep turning.
No.
Stop.
Ah!
- Okay, I won't Okay.
- Please.
Um First thing that pops in your head.
Oh, Nicky, you're such a sexy boy.
It felt crazy coming out of my mouth.
Right?
- Just some just something simple.
- Oh, my God.
Just take your pants off and get in bed.
Okay, yeah.
All right!
Okay?
Come on!
Any plans to go to the beach while you're in Los Angeles?
Bob!
He's freaking out!
- Oh.
- Nick?
I'm not freaking out.
I'm fine.
Just my heart's beating really fast.
- I feel a bit dizzy.
- Are you freaking kidding me?
- Just need one sec.
- This is ridiculous!
All I did was take my shoes off.
- Stand up and deliver!
- What happened?
What happened?
- Is it over?
Did you like it?
- No!
Look at him.
I just need one minute.
I just need one minute.
Everything's cool!
Deal's on.
I just need one minute.
- Get ahold of yourself, man!
- Hey, I'm ovulating for two more hours.
I need to get plowed!
You're dressed like you're gonna run a marathon!
Take off your windbreaker!
Schmidt, tell them to stop yelling at me!
No!
You compose yourself and you make a miracle, or I will squeeze one out of you like a bottle of mustard!
- What?
!
- Take your pants off!
There's not even a belt or a button!
Just pull 'em down!
- Yeah, let's go with the miracle already!
- Come on, man!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
- Just take your pants off!
- Five minutes, and it's done.
I don't like this!
I don't like this!
- Take your pants off!
- Do it!
Do it, Nick!
Come on, man!
Do it!
Take it out and do it!
Boundaries!
I said I need boundaries!
Get out of my way!
I need boundaries!
Unbelievable.
Wow.
So typical.
Oh, look at that.
There's the glass of milk.
Really is filled to the brim.
It's like an infinity pool.
Wow, how the hell did he carry that thing?
Bobby, I'm sorry.
I feel terrible.
No, no, no, no.
It was a bad call.
Yeah, I guess it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.
No.
I I just can't stomach my kid coming from a Bears fan, that's all.
There's nothing wrong with being a Bears fan.
- That's all I'm gonna say to that.
- There kind of is.
No, it's weird to have sex with your cousin's wife.
- That's what's weird.
- We're gonna ask Cousin Terry.
He's got no arm past his elbow, but it was an accident; it's not genetic.
It's a good call.
He's very good-looking.
Uh, excuse me.
So we're not having a baby?
Well, this is this is just great.
If you can't tell, I am being sarcastic.
What's with that guy?
He was really fat as a kid.
- Now I get it.
- Ah, that makes sense.
Yeah.
We need to have a talk about today.
- I know.
Boundaries.
- No.
It's I want you to have something.
What's this for?
I want you to save that and give it back to me when I have my own kid.
What do you mean, you're gonna have your own kid?
When I have my own kid.
Don't make a big deal of it.
I just I don't I don't hate your plan.
I kind of like it.
Things have been going pretty good for me lately, and I-I would like to meet my own Maria.
With-a the meatballs.
With-a the red sauce.
With-a the red sauce.
I want to see that plan you got for me.
Well, come on, man.
It's a rough draft, but you should check it out.
What do we got here, chief?
"Nick has a boy.
He calls him Gio".
We die on the same day in 2098?
You murder me and then kill yourself.
There's not a chance I make it to 2098.
Not a chance.
I don't want to see the 2050s.
Oddly enough, you won't.
See?
I freeze you from 2050 to 2064.
That's why you're the genius.
That's why you're the genius.
Thank you.
- Can you see her?
- Jess?
Hey.
Hey, guys.
I pulled some strings.
I got her a note that says we're here.
You are amazing.
I don't know why every wedding doesn't have a bridesman.
Ooh, I'm-a get so naked at that bachelorette party!
That's one reason.
Jess!
Okay, Nick, the bag, the bag, the bag, the bag.
Okay.
Okay.
I got it, I got it.
I got the bag.
What do you mean, the bag?
- Oh, come on!
Just one peek!
- No!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay.
We good?
- Yeah, we're good.
- Okay.
Hey.
Hey, hey, guys.
She's writing something.
- Wait for it.
Oh - _ - What?
What's happening?
- Don't worry.
Nothing.
I think she's writing something else.
- Okay.
All right.
That's something.
- _ - What's going on?
!
- Nice.
- _ - We miss you, too!
- Aw, we miss you, too!
- All right, I can't take it anymore!
- No!
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, Jess can fix it.
- Jess can fix it.
- Schmidt?
Schmidt?
Just No, no.
Cover up.
It's not gonna look like this.
I got him.
I got him.
- You got him?
Okay.
- Winston, I got him.
It's fine.
- See?
Everything's fine!
- This isn't romantic?
- Come back soon!
- I love you!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 - Hey.
- Hey, what can I get you?
Can I get a beer and, uh, your number?
- Actually, I'm - This woman is engaged.
Her number belongs to God now.
Thank you.
My bad, I didn't see a ring.
I'm wo I'm working on it.
That's something I'm working on.
Can't just put any ring on the hand of the most perfect woman in the world.
Now shoo.
Back to the mechanical shop or wherever it is you work.
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.
Okay, so you're doing it again.
I'm doing what?
Ever since we got engaged, you've been acting insanely jealous.
Look, all bartenders get hit on.
It's just part of the job.
Even Nick has groupies.
- Are you free tonight?
- I am, yeah.
Me, too!
: Oh, well, hey, well, I really hope you find something to do.
Nick is playing hard to get.
What was wrong with her?
I just wasn't feeling it.
What's "it"?
It's obvious.
It's, you know, it's : magic.
- What?
- Hmm?
Little bit of the magic thing, little bit of the - "Man stick"?
- I'm not saying "man stick".
It's what I heard.
- I'm saying "magic".
- Oh.
I don't know, I just I want magic.
Is that so bad?
I want the music to swell.
I want the wind to blow.
I-I want the clouds to part.
- Yeah.
- Love!
Magic!
Something exciting!
Why are you yelling?
Because I am embarrassed!
Don't be embarrassed, man, I want magic, too.
I want her to have a metal bra, and then I got a sword in my hand, and guess what, we both wearing skirts.
And we're riding on flying horses.
That's more like dork magic.
Okay, I don't want to upset you guys, but if you keep looking for magic, you're gonna be alone forever.
Did you just say you don't mean to upset us and then tell us we're gonna end up alone?
I actually don't care if I upset you.
Yeah, 'cause that's really upsetting.
You know, I got to I got to say, I'm with Aly on this one, she's making sense, which is why she always plays "smart cop" when we play "Smart Cop/Dumb Cop".
Not a game we play.
I'm super worried you think we do, terrified.
I feel like we're playing it right now.
Great "dumb cop," great "smart cop".
You two need to get realistic.
- You're not getting any younger, Nick.
- Wrong.
I'm in the prime of my life.
Watch me do my thing.
Show her, dude.
Get it!
Show her what you got, Nick.
See it?
See it?
Do you see it?
Is it up?
Can you see it?
Winston, call an ambulance.
I smushed every bone in my back.
Looks like you got "old man back".
- Welcome to the club.
- Looks like a cool club.
Ugh, you hear that?
Yeah, I'm sitting closer than you.
Aly was right.
We are getting older.
Ugh, don't remind me.
I don't want to be alone forever.
Maybe it's time I start looking at my love life more realistically.
Huh.
I feel like one of those characters in the show Sax and the City talking about this.
Oh, no, you mean, um, uh, Sex and the City.
I'm talking about the one with the four ladies in a jazz band.
- That's not a show.
- Carrie, Miranda, - No.
- the other one and the older one.
You're thinking of Sex and the City.
They would never allow that 'cause of the title.
Anyway, man, I'm with you, you know?
I think we should be more realistic about who we're dating.
We got to keep each other from dreaming.
- So if you see me dreaming - Pinch you.
- Well, don't pinch me, but just let me know.
- Okay.
- Let's make a deal.
- Let's make a deal.
- I got your back, you got my back.
- Yeah.
- It's time.
- It's time.
Why did y?
Reagan Lucas to see Dr. Richards.
I'm so sorry, Dr. Richards is He's right behind that water cooler.
Why don't I see any orders for Recombinex from you this month, Don?
Well, um What is this?
Spectavir, Donny?
Are you kidding me?
Maybe we can talk when you've When I've had a chance to consult my physician about the possible side effects of Spectavir?
Side effects which include dry mouth and diarrhea, wet mouth and constipation, butt sneezing, hysterical deafness, unwelcomed night-running, dusty semen You know what, why don't I put in an order for Recombinex.
Ooh, great, but only if you want to.
Anything else I can do for you?
Not unless you can get me a hotel room downtown for the next month.
My company is putting me at the Redbrick Lodge and Seafood Hut.
Ugh.
My key is a fish.
We have a room we have a room available.
I overheard you, sorry we have a room.
Uh, my name is Nick, uh, Nicholas for long.
Uh, my friend and I have a lovely room for rent in our loft downtown.
You see, our old roommate is on jury duty.
Her name is Jess, Jessica.
We had a little "will they/won't they".
Then we did, and then we fought a little bit too much.
- We still have a really nice thing.
-  Excuse me, ma'am.
I am truly sorry for my friend here, but I am sure it is not realistic that you would want to rent a place from total strangers.
Normally, no, but I have a lobster tank in my bedroom.
- We have no lobsters.
- What is the rent like?
What do you want it to be?
I don't care.
- What?
- Cheap.
- Amenities?
- Yeah, we got those.
You got a rain shower?
I love a rain shower.
Rain shower?
Crazy enough, we were installing one today.
Well, you are weirdly checking all of my boxes, so I'll come take a look.
Great, good, the, uh, the address is right here on the form under my name.
Great, I'll see you tonight.
Good luck with your "smush pain that feels like everything came out of the sandwich".
Doesn't even hurt that much, actually.
Nick, this is crazy.
Come on, man.
We agreed to not let each other do exactly this anymore.
Do I have to get tough with you?
Just admit it, you're jealous.
Uh, I'm not, I simply want a demographic breakdown of all the guys who hit on you.
You know, jacked dudes, swole dudes, yoked dudes.
What in Megyn Kelly's America are you doing, Nick?
I'm installing a high-end shower.
Nick's got a crush on a girl who is way out of his league.
- Oh - Ooh - Do you want a boom box?
- You gonna invite her to winter formal?
When you're my age, you don't form crushes anymore.
I'm past that.
I don't remember anything about her.
I mean, what, does she have brown hair, brown eyes, a nose?
She had moxie, she ran the room, she commanded it.
She's here, she's here.
All right, guys, make your hair look good.
Everybody, make your hair look good, okay?
Don't embarrass me.
South-facing windows, a balcony, stainless steel appliances, and I'm guessing someone with extreme OCD that lives here to keep this place clean.
Hello, I'm Schmidt.
You were a large child.
- That's incredible.
- Yes, I-I was obese.
You look familiar.
MTV Beach House, 2003.
Oh, my God, Reagan?
!
Cece, hi.
- How are you?
- Oh, my God!
I'm so happy to see you.
You, too.
You look incredible.
Barely recognized you.
Well, you've never seen me dry.
Cece, y-you went to the MTV Beach House?
Did you get to announce a video and then scream?
- Actually, we both did.
- Yeah.
And then we hooked up.
Yeah, that's true, too.
Is he okay?
It sounds like there's a dishwasher in his face.
I know, it's just, uh he's just processing.
What a turn of events, the fact that you guys hooked up.
You know, that was a big summer for me.
Remember, I-I pierced my nose.
- I know.
- I forgave my mom.
I realized that I was bisexual.
I mean, of course I went for you.
I go nuts for big boobs.
I'm a real melon-felon.
Oh, trust me, I remember.
I think he's having a seizure.
No, no.
It's just that when he has to process a lot of emotions, sometimes he likes to do Nick Cannon's solo from Drumline.
Maybe it's best if you continue seeing the rest of the apartment and I will, uh, make some snacks with Schmidt here.
That's a great idea.
Reagan, I'll give you the tour.
- Winston, you don't have to come.
- No, but I want to.
- Oh, don't, you're too sweet.
- And I'm walking away.
- You can stay.
- It would be my pleasure to come.
I literally nobody wants you to come.
WINSTON : Right this way.
Hey.
Can we talk?
One second.
Yes, of course.
Why, did something of note happen?
Someone I hooked up with once is potentially gonna live here.
Totally fine with it.
Okay.
As long as we both agree that open communication is the key to a healthy relationship.
Of course.
Just one second.
Be right back.
So that's where you'd put your, uh, body at night.
Alone or with somebody, up to you.
- Ooh.
- Well, I like the room.
I think I just want to get rid of the pillows, the yarn, the tote bags and anything else that makes me feel racist against white people.
That's everything Jess owns, now, isn't it, Nick?
Gone.
It's all gone.
We'll take care of it.
Winston is the loft warrior.
I'm kind of the rock of the group.
Really?
He's the rock of the group, and I'm sure Reagan would love to see how the rock lives.
Oh, my God, it's worse than I thought.
So this is my room.
I love it, it's my safe place.
This is where I write my letters to editors.
I'm a writer.
It's where I also write checks to poor people.
Charity is so important to me.
Over there, that's, of course, my bed.
That's where I dream, that's where I sleep, and, with a lucky lady, I do sex.
Do with her.
This is where I do my exercises.
I'm fascinated.
What exercises do you do?
Anything that involves the body, I do.
I'm good, uh, as my coach says, horizontally and vertically.
What does that even mean?
Your life coach?
Uh, my trainer, my coach, my leader, my guru Is that a bowl of mashed potatoes under your bed?
May God help us if it's not.
Winston, isn't there anything else you could be doing right now, like, anything?
Reagan, may I show you the bathroom?
Specifically, the shower?
- Shower's not finished.
- I'd love that.
To the left.
Was that installed by a child?
Yes, it was.
Uh, from a Big Brother program I initiated.
- Let's make it rain for the woman.
- She doesn't need to see it, she doesn't want to see it That's rude of you.
Rude.
Oh, look!
Look at the A little boy came in here and did it.
He's gonna get better with practice.
Well, I'm gonna need a working shower, so maybe I should just Don't leave, hold on.
I If you leave, the place could be rented.
It's a hot property.
There's a lot of applications.
Who am I up against?
A CEO of a major company with computers.
His name is Michael Silvergold.
Michael Silvergold.
What is his credit score?
- Michael Silvergold?
- Mm-hmm.
T twenty.
Twenty?
Five.
Twenty-five.
Thousand.
Okay.
Just fix the shower.
It needs to be in the center of the ceiling and water needs to come out of it.
You have a cat, don't you?
How'd you know?
It's very obvious.
Uh Ouch shoot.
Hold on, let me see.
Okay.
You know what?
Hold on a second.
We have this new heat-activated antiseptic gel.
You're gonna love it.
Astronauts use it to masturbate.
You are kind.
You are brave.
You are a Maccabee.
You are Daddy's favorite boy.
You are loved by a wonderful woman.
Deep breath in  All heart, all action.
Movement, direction, directive.
Is it working?
- Yeah, I feel it getting hot.
- Oh, that's because it has whale in it.
-  So weird.
- Yeah.
You're really good at this.
Thanks.
Well, you have good hands.
No!
Back off, Beach House!
So you're totally fine, huh?
Are you freaking out because she hooked up with a woman?
That's so boring.
Not at all.
I completely appreciate the fluidity of sexuality.
I'm basically a woman myself.
You're losing the thread.
I am freaking out, Reagan, because you're trying to steal my fiancÃ©e.
- No, I'm not.
- What are you talking about now?
Everybody knows that there is a window of time before any wedding where some amazing person comes out of the woodwork and tries to steal a bride.
It's the plot of every romantic comedy.
I'm the Bridgette Wilson-Sampras here!
- Who?
- I don't know.
Oh, I suppose you're both too "cool" to have seen The Wedding Planner!
Well, I've seen it.
You know what?
I didn't even know that you were engaged.
I didn't see a ring.
I am working on it!
Now get out, and you-you've crossed the line!
Here's the line and you've crossed over it.
Out!
No.
Schmidt, enough.
She's staying, I'm leaving.
You really don't trust me, do you?
Just Cece, pl-please Darling, sit  That went well for you.
I feel like I didn't handle that situation correctly.
Utilities are not included.
Just wanted to make sure that didn't get lost in all of this.
Damn it.
Are you sucking on a block of cheese?
No.
Oh, my God.
Here.
Take this free sample of antacids.
Consider it a parting gift.
I don't want this anyway.
Some weird friend group shenanigans.
I can't get involved.
You're a real lone wolf, huh?
New day, new city?
A real lady Costner.
I'm gonna take off.
So, what?
You just light fires and then walk away?
I'm sorry, are you blaming me for what happened with you and Cece?
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just saying that it's all your fault, that you caused it.
-You're pathetic.
- Yeah?
You're pathetic.
- You're pathetic.
- You're pathetic.
- You're pathetic.
- You're pathetic, you're pathetic.
I'm amazing.
Yeah?
Well, then, amaze me.
Stay and fix this.
What do you got?
You can pick one thing.
Easy.
Uterus-shaped stress toy.
Not surprised.
This is really helping, thank you.
Can I also get the double-sided pen?
No.
Hey, about earlier I'm sorry that I basically let you drown in the shower.
And then called you a soggy little bitch.
I don't know how to build a rain shower, okay?
!
Help me!
I want to help you!
But I'm gonna get wet!
It's too late for you!
There's still time for me!
I'm sorry I squirted you with all that shampoo.
It it was supposed to be a metaphor, but I-I really just panicked, to be honest with you.
I was trying to be tough, but it came off as mean.
No, I appreciate you looking out for me.
I-I've got no chance with Reagan.
She's hot and she's cool and she's bisexual.
That means she likes men and women.
I know what bisexual means.
I can't compete with that.
That's too many people, Winston, that's all the people!
It's time to stop chasing the magic.
Now I'm gonna ask out a girl who will not stop staring at me.
But why do I feel so nervous?
You know, I'll tell you why you're nervous, my friend: it's because you're human.
Because you're Where the hell is my cherry?
If you are so jealous that you want everyone else to know that Cece is engaged, hey, here's an idea why don't you get her a ring?
Because I'm afraid that whatever ring I get her isn't gonna be good enough.
Are you worried that the ring won't be good enough or that you won't be good enough?
Aren't you smart?
Yeah, well, of course I am I'm in sales.
That's so funny.
I'm in marketing.
I don't care.
Look.
Cece is definitely too good for you.
I know.
No, but seriously.
Like, she's way too good for you.
No, I know that.
Like, you should have never had a shot.
- It doesn't make any sense.
- No, trust me.
I said, like, I-I've known this the whole time.
I understand quantum physics more than I understand how you ended up with Cece.
Don't you understand that this is the problem, and I don't understand where I got to where I am right now?
You're right, I'm sorry.
And I'm all turned around.
I'm sorry, let me try and fix it.
You have two choices.
You can either spend the rest of your life terrified that somebody's gonna swoop in and steal Cece away or you can just love her, and thank the universe that she loves you back for some reason.
I know what I have to do.
Come on, we got to go find Cece.
You got to go find Cece.
You're in this now, too, baby.
You're responsible for my marriage.
Don't you ever call me "baby" again.
You want to make this about you, Reagan?
Your car, I'm driving.
My car, I'm driving.
Your car, I'm driving.
My car, I'm driving.
Your car, you're driving.
Exactly.
I said the wrong thing.
Jen just agreed to go out with me any time, any day, anywhere.
How do you feel?
Totally fine, bordering on no feeling at all.
Ah, yes, the sweet spot.
She seems really angry.
We we should probably go.
- Go!
- Okay, I thought you were giving me a hug.
Oh, hey, Schmidt.
Be careful, okay?
There's a guy over there that brought me flowers.
I might realize that I'm in love with him and run away.
Does he come in here often?
An unfortunate start.
Look, I'm sorry for not being open with you.
The truth is-is I still can't believe that you're gonna marry me.
You spent the summer of 2003 at the MTV Beach House.
I spent that same summer watching Felicity on VHS and recording a fake radio show where I reviewed snacks.
I love you.
And I know you love me.
And so  I give you my trust.
You've always had it.
And I don't feel the need to show the world that I own you by putting some gaudy gem on your hand.
I love you.
Ha-ha!
But you are getting me a real ring.
You're gonna have a diamond the size of a raisin.
We can go tomorrow.
We'll pick it out together.
I did that.
Hey, nice job.
- Thank you.
- Let me get you a drink.
Hold on, why don't you take it easy, smush pain, I got it.
I'd like to rest my heavy head Tonight on a bed Of California stars I'd like to lay my weary bones  I'd love to feel your hand touching mine Tell me why I must keep working on Yes, I'd give my life To lay my head tonight on a bed That is a perfect old-fashioned.
I know.
- Magic.
- Magic!
That was magic.
Okay, you guys saw magic.
I watched a hot girl pour herself a drink - and then leave without paying.
- Wait, she left?
She's a robber.
Nick has a crush on a robber.
How did she leave so fast?
She's amazing.
Guys, we got to go get her now.
- Let's go.
- Cece, let's go!
- Ah, son of a -  Schmidt, I'm coming!
Let's get her!
Come on!
Let's go!
Uh, you coming?
Oh, I would.
But I have to stay here and eat pretzels.
- Okay, I'll call you with an update.
- No.
- I'll text you with an update.
- Don't.
Uh, ma'am, we're surprising her because we want her to move in with us.
See, earlier I said, "Get out"!
And she did.
Which was an embarrassing mistake by me.
I don't speak English.
Oh, where are you from?
Um, outside of Connecticut.
This is a good idea.
- Great idea.
- This is a great idea.
I'm very excited.
We want you to move in with us!
9.9 miles - This just got creepy.
- Why did we do this?
I personally did it because I thought the idea was cinematic.
How loud is her music?
We just have to get out of here quickly and quietly we can, we can go out the window.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're not leaving without her.
I got this.
- Oh, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
- No, Nick.
- I got it.
- Nick, don't.
- What are you doing?
- I got it.
Shh.
Nick.
Get off me!
- Aw!
- Ooh!
Nick?
What are you doing here?
!
Thank you for the swift kick to the face.
Perhaps you want to live in our place.
Genuinely didn't rhyme on purpose.
I think what he's trying to say is, we want you - to come live with us.
- Yeah.
That's right.
I'm okay here.
I actually worked it out so that I get to pick out a lobster to eat at the end of every week.
It's a sick deal.
You know what's a sick deal?
Friendship.
That's an unacceptable segue way.
I actually like being a loner.
It means fewer people break into my hotel room.
Okay, well, if you're such a loner, then why did you help me with Cece?
I don't know.
You could've left when I kicked you out.
You could've left when you caught me beasting that hunk of cheese.
That was disgusting.
But you stayed.
Now I'm not leaving.
And Cece's not leaving and Nick Well, Nick physically can't leave.
Winston's not leaving.
Hey, I'm Winston, by the way.
None of us are leaving until you agree to move in with us.
This is actually the kindest, creepiest thing that a group of people I've only known for four hours has ever done for me.
Ah, screw it.
- I'm gonna move in!
- Hey!
Yes!
Okay, you're gonna hug, - we're gonna hug?
Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's happening.
-  I can't see what's going on, after being kicked in the head.
But I'm picturing a very happy scene.
Hey.
Hi.
Oh, no!
Help me, Reagan!
I don't know how to turn it off!
Oh, my  The handle it's too tight!
Let's try it together.
It's so wet.
I can't, - I can't get a grip on it!
- No, is this, is this hot?
Hmm.
Yeah, that's hot.
Aah, yeah, that's hot!
Oh, God, it's too wet and slippery!
No, Reagan, just if you put your I'm gonna use my teeth!
-  Yeah!
- Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Hey.
Uh, where'd you get these burritos?
From the spot on the corner?
- Mmm.
- Yeah, the spot on the corner.
You know I helped a lady give birth in the kitchen?
Ugh.
That's disgusting.
A baby in the middle of the place.
I knew that wasn't going to stop you.
- Disgusting.
- You didn't tell us you delivered a baby.
Baby's perfectly fine.
But let's just say I did not do a good job.
Oh, Reagan.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, I just jogged past a guy that's offering donkey rides for $50.
Feel like that's too much for a donkey ride, right?
It's a dog, not a donkey.
I know that guy.
His name is His name is Stan.
Stan.
S-T-A-N.
His dog's name's Cheerio.
Hold on.
It's not a donkey.
Um, it's a dog.
Okay.
That was painful, Nick.
It's like watching Cece make a bed.
Just give me the sheet!
I can't be normal around Reagan.
She's too hot and mysterious.
I mean, I haven't peed in four days, which is alarming because I have been drinking constantly.
Yep.
Nothing.
The fact of the matter is, is that she don't want to hang out with us.
She's our roommate, but she being straight up discourteous.
Reagan, why don't you join the fiesta, huh?
I'll make up a pitcher of margaritas.
That's tempting, but, uh, if I have one margarita, I'll have eight; and if I have eight, end up riding that donkey all the way to Santa Monica, so : It'd be great to watch you ride a donkey!
- Thanks, but no, thanks.
- There's extra toilet paper in the bathroom!
It's Are you hiding toilet paper again?
- I can't do this.
- Did she hit us with a "No, thanks"?
How about this?
No, thanks, to your "No, thanks".
Here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make her hang out with us whether she wants to or not.
Oh, yeah, this woman just made my nonsexual to-do list.
- You have a sexual to-do list?
- Cece, don't ask.
- Number one - I regret it already.
Joan Allen.
- Oh!
Nick!
- She's back in the kitchen!
She's back in the kitchen!
- Nick, we're making sex.
- It hasn't started yet.
It's not sex until you put the straw in the coconut.
It's called foreplay, you tween.
You don't just buy a Porsche off the lot and immediately enter it in the Groser Preis von Deutschland.
- What?
- The Groser Preis von Deutschland.
Just let me eat in here.
I don't want to eat around Reagan.
Why not?
Oh, I forgot that you're - a bear in pants.
- Will you please go eat in your room?
She's right across the hall.
She'll hear the crunching!
We need you elsewhere, Nick.
From my cold, dead hands!
That doesn't even apply.
Reagan!
Ooh, what a coincidence.
We're both running!
And I've been chasing you for miles like a murderer!
- I kind of prefer to run alone.
- You see?
That's your problem right there.
We're roommates now, and in our loft, we do things together, like a family.
Ooh, look.
A bubbler.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, that's so good!
Mmm.
- There's a Band-Aid in there.
- Reagan?
Camilla.
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Why did I think you were still in Atlanta?
Oh, because last night you sent me a text saying, "Still in Atlanta".
Well, hello.
What have we here?
- Back on the stick, I see.
- No, no, no.
No.
No.
I'm just staying with him and his roommates.
Yeah, which is exactly why you got to start hanging out with us more.
- You know, we only got you for a month.
- I get you for a whole month?
I'm about to start binge-watching Ken Burns's Jazz.
Oh, Ken Burns's Jazz.
- Call you later.
I will.
- Do that.
- Call me, yes.
Okay, great.
- I'm going to.
Okay.
- Great.
- Can't wait.
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
I am hooking up with her.
I'm dating her a little bit, but I'm over it, and I'm trying to avoid her.
What are you telling people I'm here for a month for?
Oh, you see what we're doing right now?
We're vibing, we're talking about stuff!
Okay, now it's my turn.
Let me do you.
Um I think I swallowed a Band-Aid earlier.
Now I have to dump her, and I have never dumped anybody before.
I don't know how.
- I travel so much that I usually just disappear.
- Wow.
Okay.
I will help you break up with her.
Why?
'Cause you've been dumped, like, a million times?
No.
Because I'm your roommate, and we have each other's backs.
Wait a minute.
What makes you think - I've been dumped a lot?
- Please.
I read you guys the moment I got there.
Nick's deal is, he honest-to-God might be 50.
Schmidt's deal is he had to Shazam "Stairway to Heaven".
And your deal is you've been dumped a lot.
You're pretty good.
You're pretty good.
How did Nick go through so many napkins, yet get salsa everywhere?
We've got no privacy, and it has been way, way, way too long since Mama got her biscuits.
And the biscuits are rising.
I hope they stick to the pan and get a little brown - on the bottom.
- I'm gonna be honest.
That went right over my head.
I just didn't get it.
I don't know I don't know where you're going with it.
Plus, I can't concentrate.
It's filthy in here.
How do we keep Nick out of here?
!
He thinks that Reagan is some sort of superhuman goddess.
Okay, well, the truth of the matter is, is I kind of get it.
You know, when we first met, I had to pretend that all kinds of things were wrong with you just so I wouldn't freak out.
You know, like, I gave you a glass eye for a while.
You had a wooden foot for a short period of time.
There was one week where I pretended that you were a Democrat.
I am a Democrat.
- Ah, that's so funny.
I love you.
- Okay.
- So we tell Nick she has a glass eye.
- He'll spin out.
He'll think the eye is a government-issued camera taking pictures for Langley.
Nick's a conspiracy theorist.
It's like an Irish carnival up there just potato peels, broken rides, fiddle music, dreams left unfulfilled, bloodied soccer jerseys, bunch of women limping around named Moira.
Okay.
So all we have to do is find a detail that won't make him spin out.
Easy.
It'll be the opposite of easy.
- It will be difficult.
- Oh.
We need to come up with something so smart, so nuanced, so unexpected, so surgical, that only a genius could think of it.
Reagan wears a wig.
- What?
Get out of here.
- No, it's true.
She-she told me.
- Oh, she told you?
- Yeah.
- When?
- Before.
Well, the timing definitely checks out.
The only question is why.
Personal, um, lady reasons.
I don't want to touch that.
"Reagan wears a wig".
"Told you before".
- Yep.
- "Because of lady stuff".
Wow.
I don't buy it.
Doesn't make sense.
- We failed.
- Patience.
I know my boy.
- But, Schmidt - I know my boy!
Hey, Nick.
Got to get busy living or get busy dying.
Heard.
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing is the question.
What are you doing?
- Were you just smelling my hair?
- No.
I'm just Nicky being Nicky.
Sometimes I feel like you're in one of those weird man-dog body-switch movies.
You like those, too?
Neither?
It's a wig.
: Doesn't make sense!
What?
Ding, ding.
The biscuits are ready.
Well, did you make enough for Cousin Andy?
S I'm-I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I don't get that one, either.
Who the hell is Cousin Andy?
I just made it up.
Mmm.
Reagan, I've been broken up with so many times in so many different places.
Um, multiple parks, coffee shops, uh, Santa's lap, Kitchen Stadium on Iron Chef, airplanes in economy, economy select, economy comfort, platinum economy, all covered in butterflies I feel like we have established your credentials.
Okay.
So I'm Camilla.
Break up with me.
Camilla Yes, baby.
I love you so much.
We have had a lot of really good times together, - and I just - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my goodness, oh, my God!
I knew this was comin'.
- Oh, my God, oh, my goodness.
- What-what are you doing?
Oh, no.
Are you breaking up with me?
Why you hate me?
Why you hate me so much?
- I don't I don't hate you.
I don't hate you.
- Oh, my God, you don't?
Oh, my goodness.
So you're not breaking up with me.
- We're gonna have such a happy life together.
- I-I I am.
I am breaking up with you.
Oh, my God, you is breakin' up with me.
Why you is breakin' up with me and stuff?
- Yo, this is mad crazy.
I'm pregnant with your child.
- Okay.
- That isn't possible.
- Yeah, his name is D'Lante.
We would never name our child that.
Yeah.
D-apostrophe-Lante.
No, I can't Look, I can't do this.
Look, I want you to be happy.
Here.
- Here's $80.
- Wow.
Really?
- You're just gonna bail?
- Yeah.
I suck at this, obviously.
- I don't want to hurt her.
- Honey, sit down, sit down, sit down.
Here.
Why don't you just be honest about why you're breaking up with her?
I don't know.
- I just feel like it's over.
- Let me tell you about some reasons why I've been broken up with.
Um, "you're too nasty in bed, Winston".
Or "you remind me of my brother, Winston".
Or or "Winston, you spend too much time in the butterfly house".
- I have an idea.
- Okay.
What if you break up with Camilla for me?
I'm sorry, what?
Because obviously you understand how it feels, and you'll be much more gentle and empathetic.
What?
No, that is the exact opposite of what we're trying to accomplish here.
This is a very important moment in your life.
You see, you have the ability to change, and that is what I find the most beautiful about human beings.
If you do it, I will do a 20-minute roommate dinner.
Okay, deal.
- I been thinking - Damn it, Miller!
Maybe Winston was right.
How well do we know this Reagan character?
I mean, sure, she wears a wig.
Not a big deal.
Or, let me ask you, is it a big deal?
Ask yourself, what type of person wears a wig?
A bald person?
Sure.
I'll say so.
They're bald.
Somebody hiding something?
- Definitely.
- Okay, look.
Maybe she's not hiding anything, all right?
BeyoncÃ©, BeyoncÃ© wears wigs, and you would trust BeyoncÃ© with your life.
Yeah, I'd trust BeyoncÃ© with my life.
We be all night.
We be all night.
Nick, is it possible that you are maybe overthinking this just a little bit, okay?
'Cause, look, Reagan is a really good roommate.
She's quiet, she pays, she takes care of her room.
Her room.
That's it.
Great thinking.
That's why I love you.
That's why.
Not physically.
Uh, but as a person.
Like, um, it's not sexual.
I love you like a mother or a sister or a girlfriend.
It's not sexual.
Her room!
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
Jackpot.
Ribbons!
Oh, these are probably Jess's.
Nick, stop.
You should not be in here.
I am learning so much about you, Reagan.
An Ohio State T-shirt.
Cash from Canada.
It's Canadian cash.
A picture of a little boy.
This woman is like an orange.
You peel a layer, there's another layer there.
You're thinking of an onion.
An orange only has one layer.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Okay, someone has to put everything back - exactly like they found it.
- Well, it clearly is gonna be me, 'cause I'm the only one who can fold.
Nick, what are you doing?
I'm making a mess, but I'm finding the truth.
Okay, I'm gonna end this.
Nick, Reagan doesn't wear a wig.
We made the whole thing up.
- But I smelled it and I saw it.
- We couldn't get you - out of our room.
- Why would you lie to me?
Well, we wouldn't need to lie to you if you would just talk to Reagan instead of hiding out in my room with your cheap Southwestern food.
- Talk to her?
Like a normal human being?
- Yes, - that's exactly what I want you to do.
- Yes.
Mm-hmm.
I have nothing in common with that woman.
She is a goddess who's descended from the heavens.
And I'm just a mud man from the bowels of Chicago.
Let's clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
- She's gonna be home soon.
- Wait.
What are these?
"Sarah Nevada"?
"Suzi Shimizu"?
That's Reagan's face.
These are fake I.D.'s.
Fake I.D.'s?
Okay.
It's f it's fake identification.
You're damn right it is, Jack.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Look, this is a little bit weird, but I'm sure there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for this.
Maybe Nick is onto something here, okay?
Because how much do we actually really know about her?
- Who has fake I.D.'s?
- I'll tell you who.
Con men.
Grifters.
It's all starting to make sense to me.
Check this out.
Let me break this down for you.
Okay?
She and her bastard son - Or her nephew.
- who she had with the Ohio State professor, go town to town, selling let's say fake pills.
Pills.
Doctor.
Pharmacy.
Whatever she does.
To a bunch of maple-sucking tree huggers.
Aka those lovely stoners from the north, our Canadian brothers and sisters.
Let's just clean this place up, and let's get out of here.
Guys!
Winston made me bring home dinner.
- It's Reagan.
- Or is it Suzi?
Oh, Jewish God, why do you hate me?
Clean up the floor!
- Okay, yeah.
- She is the one who has to explain herself.
- Let her come in here.
- You have gone full Nick, Cece.
- What does that mean?
- She's bought into your nonsense!
Enough.
I'm very disappointed with you.
- Put this down.
I'll-I'll fold it.
- I just picked it up!
You don't know what you're doing.
- Hey, Reagan, come in here!
- No, no, Reagan!
- Don't come in here!
- There's a possum in here!
Don't come in here, 'cause there's What do you mean Reagan wants to break up with me?
Who are you?
- I'm her roommate.
- Oh, so she sent her roommate to break up with me?
Now I have no more questions.
Great.
Then I'm out.
Blessings.
Okay, look, um, I know this is not ideal.
But if I'm being honest, she's got a lot - of work to do emotionally.
- Are you really gonna let her get away with this?
You must know how this makes me feel.
You've clearly been dumped many times.
Why do people keep saying that?
You ordered a Shirley Temple.
It's a virgin Denzel.
If she wants to dump me, she should man up and look me in the eye.
You know what, she should have, and I told her that.
It's the least she could have done.
Hey, you're preaching to the choir.
Ask me how many times I've been dumped.
- I don't have the - 47 times.
And once on my birthday.
And out of that 47 times and once on my birthday, do you know what part hurts the most?
- Getting bailed on.
- Getting bailed on.
Why do people think they can just disappear on you?
They're not thinking at all.
Except of themselves.
Let's go find her.
Hell yeah.
Ooh, wait, wait, wait, I just thought about it, - and that's not a good idea.
- Where is she?
How you how you know I know where she at?
You said you're roommates.
Damn.
Bitten by my own snake.
So you all went through my room and you each have things that you would like to discuss.
Is that correct?
- That's true.
- Yes.
- Chicago.
So the money, the fake I.D.'s.
I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.
I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.
Who does?
Okay.
All right, fine.
What about this, though your son?
He looks just like you.
- That is me.
- Wait.
What?
Oof.
Rough haircut.
Oh, and if you found something in my room that kind of looks like a hollowed-out hand, that's a glove.
- So I went full Nick, huh?
- Yes, you went full Nick.
Right, yeah, I see that now.
I'm full Nick every day.
Imagine how that feels.
We all owe you an apology for pretty much everything.
I'm sorry that we went through your room.
Well, that's not what I'm upset about.
I mean, I went through all of your rooms when I first moved in.
- Excuse me?
- Wait, you went through our rooms?
- Oh, no.
- How else am I supposed to get to know you?
But the point is I didn't jump to conclusions.
I mean, Nick has a two-by-four in his room with a nail in it.
I didn't assume he was building a human cage.
I'm building a tree house.
You're doing wha you're building a tree house?
Well, why am I not involved?
Why is Cece not involved?
- We want to be involved.
- Oh, I'm involved.
- So's Winston.
- What?
Everyone's involved in the tree house but I?
Forget about it.
Reagan, how would you like - to build a tree house with me?
- No.
Reagan, we already got plans, we already got a two-by-four.
No.
I feel like we are really off-topic here.
What I'm trying to say is: Why did you just assume that I'm a criminal?
Well, because these two are paranoid maniacs.
Who apparently are building a tree house together.
- Not apparently.
We are.
- Mm-hmm.
On the other hand, we hardly know anything about you.
Oh, my God.
Okay, that's what this is about?
Look, I'm-I'm only gonna be here for a few weeks.
There is no reason to get all emotionally involved.
Let's just keep it clean, and that way nobody gets upset.
I am so upset right now.
Uh, let me get ahead of this, roomie.
I did not help out today.
Camilla.
Hi, baby, hi.
- What are you doing here?
- Cut the crap.
- Why?
- You sent him to dump me?
No.
To dump you?
No.
Why would I do that Why would you do that?
- What the hell, man?
- That is crazy.
Why would anyone do that?
What's wrong with you?
: Tell the truth, you sneaky woman.
Reagan, are you dumping me or not?
No.
Kind of.
Look, Camilla, I, uh I don't want to I don't want to hurt you.
Just say it.
Okay.
The truth is that I'm a criminal.
- What?
- I'm a criminal.
You shouldn't be with me.
I'm disgusting.
Things I've done.
Things I'm capable of.
Hard life, short life I probably won't live that long.
I can't believe this.
She's a criminal.
Filthy.
Disgusting crimes.
- One of the worst human beings I've ever met in my life.
- And who are you?
I'm her, uh, co-criminal.
Co-gangster.
We run the streets together.
From Bangkok to Chicago to here.
Just murdering people.
My name is Nick.
On the streets, they call me, uh - Sharky.
- Sharky, that's right.
'Cause I attack from beneath up.
It's all true, Camilla.
And her name is not Reagan.
It's Suzi Shimizu.
- You're Japanese?
- Very much so.
We happen we happen to all be Japanese.
The unlucky offspring of a couple very lucky American GIs.
- Unnecessary backstory.
- Yeah, they call me the Moyel on the streets, 'cause I will, uh cut your penis off.
- Isn't that right, Sharky?
- You're on your own, Moyel.
And they call me Cece, but spelled S-I-S-I, with an accent over the last I. I am spinning out here, Moyel.
You got to help me.
Why don't you go spin all the way over to your tree house?
- Schmidt knows about the tree house?
- Okay, what the hell is going on?
Winston, check for a wire she could be a rat.
Stop it.
This isn't real.
You're telling us we're not a Japanese crime family?
Reagan, tell me the truth.
Reagan, seriously, just stop bailing.
I'll just go.
Camilla, wait.
Look This isn't working out.
But I think that it's my fault.
Because I don't let people in.
I'm sorry.
I think that you deserve a lot better than that.
Thank you.
I know that wasn't easy for you.
Okay, well, I'm gonna take off.
- Do you, um, still have my blue sweater?
- Yes.
- Oh, no, no, no - Uh, it's right in my room.
Right here, in the first door.
- Right there.
- Okay, thanks.
- Oh, no, no.
- That's nice.
Telling the truth works.
Yeah, it did.
- Good job.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait for it.
Freaking bitch!
I hate you!
I hate you so much!
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's the old "I left my sweater" trick.
Let me tell you something, folks, I've played that song before.
All right, well, this obviously turned out to be - a huge disaster.
- I hate you so much!
- But thank you.
- Try sleeping on an upside down bed!
I'm proud of you.
All of you I mean, you guys could've bailed on me, but you didn't.
You stuck around, and you helped me lie to a psychotic woman who is now destroying all of my stuff.
- Anything to help.
- It's kind of what we do.
It's how we roll.
- How do you think she's taking it?
- What's with all these ribbons?
!
How long do you think she's gonna be in there?
I like to do about 15.
You are never gonna forget me!
You are never gonna forget Camilla!
So, what'd you bring us for dinner?
How about this one?
Are you ready to soak Mama's beans?
- It's working, right?
- Okay, shh.
I love you.
- Yeah, I love you, too.
I love you.
- Let's not talk.
Okay.
Nick!
- What?
- You still can't eat - in front of Reagan?
- This has nothing to do with Reagan.
I I've just gotten used to eating in here.
It's cozy.
Why, what are you guys up to?
What?
Can I come in?
My room is trashed.
This is where we eat, right?
Yes, please, please, please.
- Might as well.
- I mean, sure, why not?
What?
I like the way you eat a burrito.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Â¡Buenas noches!
- Aah!
- Oh!
- Winston!
- Oh oh All over the bed?
!
I didn't get my huevos on you, did I?
Close your robe!
Okay!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 Well, that one diner has the best bacon.
- Great bacon.
- So I don't know.
Ugh, come on, guys.
Please, God, we're entering minute 20 of the great brunch debate.
The other diner does have that special fruit cup.
- Other diner.
Fruit cup.
Let's go.
- However, when I think about it, huge crowd - looking for that special fruit cup.
- Smart.
So now we got to think line versus bacon.
Please, I am starving.
Make a decision.
Oh, hi.
Do you guys want to join us?
We are going for brunch in seven days.
Hybrid meals are for people who are too lazy to wake up for a proper breakfast.
Besides, we're looking for a wedding venue today.
Good luck with these two, because if they get - really hungry, then all bets are off.
- Curveball - maybe we roast a turkey.
- Have either of you ever made a decision in your lives?
- I make decisions all the time.
- Disrespectful.
- What's the last decision that you made?
- First of all, you got to make a decision if you gonna make a decision.
- You know what I mean?
-  Of course we make decisions.
How do you think I'm wearing clothes right now?
I laid those out for you, Nick.
- But I decided to let you.
- This is your whole problem.
Imagine how much better your life would be - if you could just make a decision.
- She's just mad because she had a bunch of dumb brunch ideas, - you damn fool.
-  Okay.
Uh, well, what about this?
I will sleep with one of you tonight if you can just decide who.
- Are you are you serious?
- I mean, we're talking about a one-time thing and you can't get weird afterwards, but, yeah, I'm down for, like, a fun half hour.
- And you would be there?
- Yes.
You would physically be there?
Yes.
Can it be nice?
Well, that's on you.
Let me know by 9:00.
- What if we die before then?
- There's not much I can do about that.
Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.
I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made, - am I right?
- No, they don't.
To the sausage factory.
- What?
- That's not what I meant.
- Yeah.
Let's go.
- All right.
- Thank you for the opportunity.
- Good luck - with your decision.
-  At what cost?
One sexual barracuda to another, I see what you're doing.
You're doing it for the story.
You want to see how deep the abyss goes.
You want to look that monster straight into the eye.
Maybe it's so bad that it's good.
But it's not good.
It's b it's bad.
Okay, honey, calm down.
- She's not actually gonna do it.
- No, I'm trying to teach them a lesson.
This isn't an '80s summer camp movie.
I'm not gonna sleep with somebody based on a bet.
I'm just I was just kind of playing along with the whole thing just in case they were listening at the door.
Something about "summer camp moogie".
"Summer camp moogie".
No, no, no.
I got nothing.
This isn't real, right?
It can't be.
- I mean - I mean, it can't be.
- Why would it be?
- But on the off chance that it is, we need to take this extremely seriously.
You're absolutely right.
Okay, okay.
Well, what do you suggest?
We do a gentlemen's debate.
A gentlemen's debate.
We calmly discuss who merits this opportunity and we come to a decision based off respect and politeness.
I agree.
So please proceed, sir.
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome, sir.
Okay.
The gentleman knows that I have a monster crush on Reagan.
But because this is such a powerful argument in my favor, I politely take it off the table.
In that case, the gentleman politely thanks you.
Hmm.
The gentleman was sure that the other gentleman would not be such a jerk and let his friend's dreams come true.
Perhaps I'm not dealing with a gentleman at all.
Perhaps I'm dealing with a dingus.
- Did you call me a dingus?
- You're acting like a dingus.
How can I be a dingus when you're the damn dingus?
- You're the dingus.
You're the d - You're-you're you are - Oh.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Looking forward - to sex later.
- Well, that makesthree of - That makes two of us.
- Well, get ready for the skin circus, you little peanut.
Okay.
Whoa.
I was put in an awkward situation, - and I reacted poorly.
- Oh, whoa.
Everything rides on this decision.
You know, the venue is the axle of the wedding chariot.
I know that you have dreamed about this day since you were a little boy, but we are paying for this out of our own pocket, okay?
So we cannot get carried away.
Okay.
-  Yeah.
-  -  Oh, I see - Okay, this could work.
-  - Yeah Huh?
- Oh, my God.
No.
- Oh!
Some tea lights and flowers and this place could be nice.
It's like a Mumford & Sons music video, yeah?
Is there hay in here?
We're looking for the vacant warehouse for the wedding venue?
- Vacant warehouse?
- They're closing us down.
We're all getting fired.
- Grab what you can!
- Hey, you guys, kind of not cool.
You were supposed to text me before you got here.
Okay.
Can everyone just take a seat, please?
- Can you just stop t -  Hey, you  Me owe you?
You ditched me when we were supposed to run away from home together.
I built that raft for nothing!
We could do this all day, but I have actual feelings for her.
I thought you said feelings were off the table.
Well, I'm putting 'em back on the table.
I'm gonna settle this right here, right now.
- Do it.
- Cindy No.
De La Garza.
- Oh.
- Huh, so look at me.
Look at me.
Let it affect you.
You knew I had a crush on Cindy De La Garza, - and you Frenched her anyway.
-  Frenching!
They're Frenching!
They're Fren Chaperone!
They're Frenching!
I had dibs on her since the fifth grade, dude!
- If I could un-French her, I would.
- You owe me this.
I knew that French was gonna haunt me.
You called dibs and I screwed up.
- What you gonna say?
What you gonna say?
- It's you.
Oh, yes.
Man, that girl better get ready for some kind, attentive lovemaking.
Oh.
Hey, uh, have you guys seen my purple sweater?
Uh, no.
And, by the way, we've made our decision.
Wow.
That was fast.
You have until 9:00.
We don't need it.
You'll be having Winston.
- That's me.
I'm Winston.
- Great.
Don't eat for two hours before.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Bring your A-game, okay?
Any previous injuries that I need to know about?
Bring something to numb your mouth.
Oh.
Look.
The sweater was in my hand the whole time.
You know, this woman requested my A-game.
My A-game.
Maybe it's hopeless that I could even please this woman sexually.
What am I thinking, Winston?
Just focus on yourself.
Concentrate on yourself sexually, Winston.
No, Winston, that is not your way.
I just want to head off any discussion of what your way is.
I'm so sorry.
I'm just feeling a little insecure about my body and the way it is connected to my face.
Bishop  you have nothing to worry about.
Really?
Yeah.
Okay.
What's my best feature?
Instant regret.
Instant.
The second I said it, I was like - If you had to pick.
- Fine.
You have very nice - That's our suspect.
He's taking off!
- What?
- Okay.
-  Okay, I'll let you take point on this one, because I got to protect my duke for later.
Oh, you suck so much.
Has that park always been a pet cemetery or were just crazy people burying a dog there?
Well, I'm not even close to giving up.
Why don't we just pop in here?
Oh, really?
We just "happened" upon The Lisbon, Schmidt?
Purely a coincidence that we made it just on time for the appointment that I made a month ago.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Ah.
Mr. Schmidt.
May I offer you a beverage?
Perhaps an organic cucumber vodka spritzer?
Yes.
It is so beautiful.
I feel like I'm inside Cate Blanchett.
We get that a lot.
I've got to say, I'm pretty impressed with how quickly you guys came to that decision.
Well, that's 'cause you don't know how mature we are.
You see, Winston had dibs on Cindy De La Garza since the fifth grade, I Frenched her in the eighth grade, so So about 20 years ago Winston had a three-year-old dib, he never acted on it, and now you're the bad guy?
: Oh, Reagan.
First of all, dibs can't be singular I mean, if anything, it's kind of a story about how indecisive Winston can be.
- Well, no, it's a story about - But you guys came to a decision I'm proud of you.
Uh, can I can I practice my presentation on you?
- Sure.
But I'm bored already.
- Okay.
This stuff's really boring for me.
- For everybody, I guess.
- Hmm.
Hepatitis C can be a long arduous experience.
But now discover Zilpoza from Wudai Pharmaceuticals.
FDA approval pending double-blind study.
If you've had cirrhosis or kidney disease, Zilpoza may not be right : for you.
You think I'm a 13-year-old boy?
I know what you're doing.
- What am what am I doing?
- You're trying to lead me on, and I won't have it.
Case closed!
You're having Winston!
Great, I'm having Winston.
Uh Mm.
It's so juvenile, what you're doing.
A dib is a dib.
Oh, God, if I keep looking at the ceiling, I'm gonna cry.
Damn it, we are getting sucked in we have to leave immediately.
It's probably not even available.
- There's no way, right?
I mean - You're right.
Philip.
Hmm?
Quick question.
Look, we realize that you guys book up decades in advance, so please just let us know - that you don't have any slots available.
- Actually, you're in luck Shia LaBeouf had to cancel his solitaire tournament, and we have one open slot, in April.
-  - In April?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, babe, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You need to breathe.
We're just gonna enact the plan that we set up for when you see an ankle boot you really, really, really like, right?
What do we do?
We walk away And if I dream about it in the middle of the night, then it's meant to be.
We're gonna walk away, Philip.
Thank you so much for all your help.
I should let you know, however, there is another interested party.
BENJAMIN : What?
Schmittyballs?
B B-Benjamin.
Okay.
-  You're engaged?
- Hmm.
- Mazel to you, sir.
- Hey, Meems, this is the, uh, fat guy from school we used to make dance for chocolate.
-  Oh.
-  In all fairness, uh, Benjamin would peg chocolate at my head while I was already dancing.
- He what?
- Benny-boo, I don't want to lose The Lisbon to these fat people.
- The hell?
- Don't worry, Schmidtstain can't afford The Lisbon.
- Oh.
- Unless, of course, they accept gift certificates from fat camp.
Benjamin, I still I mean I can Do they do that?
I'm a different We'll have to ask somebody about that.
Okay, that is it!
- We are booking The Lisbon.
- We are?
- Go!
- No.
I've never loved you more, Cece!
What were you gonna say?
What is that in reference to?
It's been silent for 30 minutes.
Earlier, you were gonna tell me what my best feature was, and then we got distracted.
- Right.
By crime.
- I could tell you - what yours is.
- Oh, my God, please don't.
- You have a lovely neck.
- Really?
Not my knuckles or, like, the skin behind my ears?
Okay, do me.
It's my turn.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, I need this.
Fine.
I will tell you, but then we drop it immediately and forever.
Drop.
You have kind eyes.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I have kind eyes.
I'll take that.
You know, I always thought I had snail eyes.
"Immediately and forever," remember?
I'll turn around.
Turn around.
I-I'll save my kind eyes for last.
Okay.
Hello?
I'm reopening the Reagan decision.
Wait, what?
: I already took my supplements.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm telling her we've decided, and it was me.
Oh, no, you are not!
I hear shaving.
- Are you shaving?
- No!
I know what that means.
Hello?
Hello, Nick?
: Damn.
Just go.
You mean it?
Thank you very much, Aly.
I am going to win this sex bet!
We want to get married at The Lisbon.
We want to book The Lisbon right now!
Uh, start by filling these forms out.
- It'll be pleasure.
- Yeah, no problem.
What's our routing number?
- 69364278.
- Just gonna give Benjamin - a little coffee oh, I'm so sorry.
- Hey, come on, - she can't do that.
- No, no, she did that.
I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.
- Oh, wow.
The service is so gorgeous.
- Really great.
- You do realize we're not gonna decide this on who writes the fastest.
You know, here at The Lisbon, - we celebrate grandeur, romance.
- Oh, you are Schmidt out of luck, Schmidt.
Our wedding's gonna be sick romantic.
Our wedding's gonna be way romantic, bro.
Quiches so small you got to wear glasses.
Bitch, we're gonna have more white linen than a hospital in the Great War.
Yeah, we're gonna have so many fresh cut flowers that you're gonna have a real bee problem - up in this bitch.
- We're gonna have spanakopita so flaky, you're gonna get crumbs - all over your mouth, like, what?
- Our tables are gonna be names of cities that we've been to, like, what?
Our wedding is gonna be so big that the Giants will come to town and everyone gets a big spoon.
Philip, you-you want romance?
Let me tell you the story about how I knew that Mimi was the one for me.
- The story is called "Lovestruck".
-  There's a title?
It was our fourth date, and we had just seen Toy Story 3 - for the second time.
- Maybe it's just us, but we love Pixar.
-  We're nerds.
-  I reach for Mimi's hand, and I was struck by lightning.
I mean, literally, I was struck - Yeah.
Zap.
- by a bolt of lightning, Philip, and I I would've been killed if Mimi hadn't grounded me.
- We met crying -  over the same name at the Vietnam Memorial.
George Harrison Ford.
Wha?
Who was our grandfather.
What?
Making us cousins?
Making us cousins, because there is nothing more romantic than forbidden love.
Between family members?
I mean, that's You're gonna double down with that?
- Yes, I am.
- He's writing "cousins" down.
That's a positive thing.
No, it's not.
Hey.
What are you doing, man?
- We had a decision.
- The decision wasn't valid your dib on Cindy - was expired.
- Okay, first of all dibs don't expire.
Also, dibs not singular.
And how are you still shaving?
I'm doing full body, Winston.
I started from the bottom, now I'm here.
- That's gross.
- I've been doing sex prep all day.
I did a hundred girl push-ups.
I washed my feet until the water ran clear.
You can clean your feet all damn day it don't matter, because I'm having sex with Reagan tonight.
- The decision's been made.
- Well, the decision's been changed I'm having sex with Reagan.
- That's not gonna happen.
- It is gonna happen.
Now, if you'll excuse me - No, don't - Got it!
- What were you going for?
- The cologne.
- I smell so pretty!
- Give me give me my col  No.
No, no, no.
No.
Oh, God!
Aah!
-  What are you doing!
- I don't know, man!
You got frickin' cologne all over me.
I smell fantastic!
- Oh, my God.
- We got to turn the tables on Reagan, - make her decide.
- I don't see her going for it, man the entire point was that we had to make a decision.
Well, then I guess we're gonna have to trick her, and I know how.
We'll up your fee by $10,000.
Ten thousand and one dollar!
Uh, Cece, we don't have $10,000.
We barely have the one.
- Ten thousand and two dollars!
- It's not your turn to bid.
$15,000!
- $15,000 - It's not it's not it's not worth it.
It's not worth it.
Yeah, but it's your dream.
I I know.
But I already have my dream.
It's marrying you.
It's all yours, Benjamin.
Yes!
"I have my dream".
Dumb!
They remind me of my stupid grandparents on their 60th anniversary.
Old.
Reagan.
Let me guess.
You guys made a final decision?
Please.
Sit.
That's probably the first time you've been right all day, but yes, we have made a decision.
- Great.
-  Here's the deal, Reagan.
It's 2016, you're a lady.
Your decision is important to us.
Yes, we want you to decide which one of us is most attractive to you, and if that person is the same name that's on the piece of paper in this envelope, then sexual relations can commence.
Okay, well, the logic is bulletproof.
I just feel like if I'm gonna be making this decision, I need you guys to pitch yourselves.
For starters, I'm completely hairless, Okay.
except for a straggler near one of my nipples, because I got scared while shaving.
In my fantasies, I'm a wild lover.
In real life, my sexual prowess has been described as "fine," "adequate".
"It'll get the job done".
That is both a lot and a little, but either way, a tough act to follow.
- Winston, you're up.
- Well, that's easy.
I've got kind eyes.
You don't have kind eyes.
You have snail eyes.
Everybody knows that.
I've got kind eyes.
Aly told me so.
Who's Aly?
Yeah, she's my partner at work.
I complimented her first, told her she had a very nice neck, which she does.
But what I should have said was, "You got a really cool chin," or "You got some dope earlobes".
Honestly, everything about her is great.
And when I'm with her, I never really notice time.
It's probably because she is the best part of my day.
I should I should have told her one of those things, as opposed to the neck thing, you know.
Then she told me I had kind eyes.
- You like Aly.
- Yes.
- She's my partner.
-  Winston!
Come on, it's obvious.
You like Aly.
I-I like her.
I-I like Aly.
Oh, my goodness!
Why did I never think of that before?
Wow, my mouth is dry.
Anybody else's mouth dry?
What should I do?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
What should I do?
Winston, this is Cindy De La Garza all over again.
You need to make a decision.
I got to ask her out.
- Good!
Go!
- Go ahead!
Go!
Good luck!
Listen, Reagan, I am so sorry, but obviously, we will not be making love tonight.
- No.
It's not fair.
- I'm sorry.
I got to go.
Well, I guess that leaves just old Nick Miller.
Mm.
Your room or my room?
Hmm?
Well, both rooms have a lot of interesting possibilities.
Mm-hmm.
That's a heck of a question.
Your, um Give me 15 minutes, and I'm gonna come back and tell you which room and why from my opinion, and then, you can give me yours, and we can discuss.
Just give me one second, and, uh, I'll be good to go.
I just need two minutes tops.
Stay there.
- Oh.
- Oh!
Aw, no!
Oh, that's a lot of blood.
Oh.
Damn.
Well, you're back, and you have an insane look in your eyes, - so congratulations?
- No, I didn't do it.
I was, uh You know, I thought about it.
Oh, I don't need to know.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah Would you like to go out after work, grab a drink with me?
Sure.
Sure.
All right then.
Oh.
Uh, can my boyfriend come?
Your boyfriend?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure!
- How long have you guys been?
- Yeah, it's new.
It's new.
It's new.
It's He's an agent, actually, for animal actors?
What am I gonna say?
No.
He should stay at home and not exist, please.
No, I won't say that.
Officer down to meet your boyfriend.
I realize those were a poor choice of words for a station.
Nick!
It's almost 9:00.
Are we doing this or what?
What is that?
You look like you're in a Boca Raton street gang.
I didn't think you were actually gonna go through with it, and even if you were I made a decision.
I wouldn't want it like this.
So I decided to put on my I'm-not-having-sex tonight outfit, 'cause no one's gonna have sex with me in this outfit.
And now I'm gonna go out and have a drink.
Would you like to come?
Wow.
Deciding Nick.
Let me change.
FYI your I'm-not-having-sex-tonight outfit is leopard print and tight.
- I don't know if you know that.
- It's animal print, but it's not tight.
These are baggy, fuzzy PJs with a flap on the butt.
Exactly my point.
You want to see what's in the envelope?
- It's a blank sheet of paper.
- You're so wrong.
Does that look like a blank sheet of paper?
- Very clever.
- Thanks, yeah.
I thought of it when I was getting tickets to the World Series of Chili and had to prove that I was human.
Ooh, ooh.
We've got big news, you guys.
Champagne all around.
We're getting married in a  soon-to-be-abandoned warehouse!
Yeah.
Champagne.
- Oh, thank you.
- And I'll even give you one.
Hey, guys, Aly is on her way to the bar.
-  - With her boyfriend.
- Oh, that's the worst.
- Well, you know, everyone dies.
Maybe he'll die.
I'm sorry, Winston.
Is there anything we can do to cheer you up?
Uh, no.
Anything that would make you feel better?
- Anything?
- Anything?
Well, if you insist, then.
You asked me what I wanted.
This is all want.
All right, let's do it, let's do it.
Let's just do it.
Let's do it.
Motown Philly's back again Now slower.
: With a little - East coast fling -  Slower
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1  A record heat wave is melting Los Angeles, sparking chaos in stores across the Southland.
Riot police have been summoned to several locations Oh, damn.
This heat is untenable.
It's like a Jewfro apocalypse in here.
I look like a '70s divorce attorney.
So we don't have A/C.
You guys are going to love this.
I invented something even better.
It's called the Ranch System.
The Ranch System for Cooling.
This is one of my best inventions.
Reagan's going to freak out when she sees it.
Check it out.
We've got a combination of cool winds, a-a cool, chilly pond, you wear white jeans 'cause they don't absorb heat that's actually science, I did research.
You know, science aside, man, you working those jeans.
Oh, thanks for saying that, man.
I was insecure about the way they looked.
You killing it, man.
Hey, guys.
How are you doing?
Well, everything here looks normal.
Welcome to The Ranch.
I don't know what that means.
Have a seat.
Why would I do that?
It'll cool you right off.
You'll love it.
Ooh.
Is that chair supposed to be wet?
It is.
- I Okay.
And away we cool!
: Check it out!
Feels like somebody is learning to whistle very close to my face.
That's right, it does.
She said it feels like someone's whistling close to her face!
I never thought of that.
It's another plus.
No.
No, it's not.
But I have a better idea.
Why don't we all cool off with the brand-new air conditioner that I bought?
- Son of a - Yes!
- What?
- What?
- A/C!
- Oh - Damn.
-  Oh, it was so hot.
- Oh, yeah, this is wet.
-  Having A/C.
That's sweat from my bottom.
This is amazing.
Thank you, Reagan.
Finally, we can stop living like people in a beer commercial - before the beer shows up.
- How did you pull this off?
It's not a big deal.
That whole riot thing's really overblown.
- Get the hell back!
-  I will be putting the A/C in my room and everyone is welcome.
No, thank you.
We're good.
I speak for all of us.
Okay.
Well, we are observing gym rules, so make sure you wipe down anything you plan to sit on.
Whatever.
More breeze for us.
I'm gonna grab some old underpants and I'll put a pair in the freezer for each of you.
Trust me, I'm wearing frozen underwear right now, - and I feel amazing.
-  So, I'm in good shape.
- Cece?
- Mmm.
I think maybe you should go go hang out by the A/C.
Cece's got a big audition today to be a reporter.
She's been taking broadcasting classes.
Any way you slice it, that cafeteria pizza is a great deal.
You know, in fact, I'm getting a little hungry myself.
How about you, Carl?
I thought the next thing I was supposed to talk about was the rain.
It is, Carl.
I was just having a little banter.
Oh.
Um I uh, I had a sandwich so I'm full.
The audition's just for gas station TV, okay?
Nobody watches it.
Don't you dare downplay it.
I adore gas station television, I mean, myself, personally.
It is the intersection between information and also gas.
That's right.
Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.
I just, I don't I-I don't think I'm gonna go to the audition.
'Cause it's it's just so hot.
You know?
Okay.
Um Yeah, I mean, that's-that's cool.
Just Look, I love you no matter what.
Go cool off.
- All right.
- All right.
Can I talk to you for a second?
What the hell was all that coddling?
- Whoa.
- What are you, a big-bosomed grandma?
Tough love!
Make her go!
Don't tell me what to do!
I'm her fiancÃ©, not some schnook off the street eating a peanut butter cookie.
It's my job to give her love and support.
That's how I get her to go to the audition.
As a cop, do you think I would get anyone to do anything if I were being kind and supportive?
Hell no!
Look, I have recently found my cop voice and I'll tell you this: it is very effective.
Is that what you've been practicing in the bathroom?
: Everybody stop!
Make a left turn!
: You have the right to remain silent!
You : Freeze!
Nah.
: Three hundred and three thousand thelonious thistles : Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs.
: Freeze!
: Ooh, ooh.
: Down on the ground, fugitive of the law.
Handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs, handcuffs Handcuffs, handcuffs.
Those were just my warmups.
My point is this, man.
You can't hug and kiss Cece into doing anything.
Your mind would melt if you knew what I've hugged and kissed Cece into doing.
Stay out of it, Winston.
: My guys.
Hey, who needs Reagan's A/C, right?
Here.
Put some of my old underwear on your face.
It feels great.
Oh, Nick you're gonna make a great dad.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Hey!
Who needs him, huh?
Yeah.
We got each other.
- Yeah.
- We've been through worse.
- Chicago!
- Chicago!
City of soup, you know?
Yes, sir.
So I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'll be back in a hot minute.
Or, as we say on a day like today - a minute.
-  That's great, man.
That's chill, that's chill.
That's great.
Thanks for taking my back today.
- I'll see you in a sec.
- All right, all right.
- You and me, all day.
You and me.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
Look who it is!
What happened?
The A/C fall over and squish Winston's cat?
Oh, my God, please don't tell me that happened.
I would die.
I just came out here to tell you that it's actually really nice in there.
It's really nice right here, with my underpants on my face.
I think maybe you should stop pouting because I didn't like whatever this is.
Wait, what?
Why would I care if you, specifically, didn't like it?
Nick.
Reagan.
Nick, come on.
You want to go there?
I want to go where?
What are you talking about?
You wanted to impress me because you have a crush on me.
It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.
I need a laugh.
It's too hot not to laugh.
Lord knows it!
- You do.
-  I don't have a crush on you.
You're very conceited.
And I don't mean to burst your bubble here, Missy, but I am not out here because of my "so-called crush on you, "based on my actions that led you to believe I have a crush on you".
I am out here because I have never been more comfortable in my entire life.
Okay, you know what?
Just go get!
Winston and I don't need you, sister.
Oh, you mean Winston, like, this Winston?
What do you mean, like this Oh, Winston.
I'm really sorry.
It's fine, it's fine.
Who needs you?
'Cause the hottest part of the day is already over.
It's 9:30 in the morning.
Then tell me this: why did I just eat lunch?
Why did I just eat lunch?
Mm, another guy just collapsed out there.
Oh, but a good Samaritan to the rescue.
Oh, damn.
Good Samaritan just collapsed.
Oh!
And UPS guy to the rescue!
And the UPS guy just collapsed.
Ah, lady stealing packages Ah  Oh!
And the lady just collapsed.
Whoo.
You know, I'm actually kind of getting chilly in here.
Look, guys.
I got this box of Jess's weird old ski clothes.
- Oh!
- Ooh Hello, 1989.
Check me out, I'm Picabo Street.
You know who that is, right?
I don't know who that is.
Real aprÃ¨s-ski vibe.
I feel like I'm in Gstaad.
Gstaad's all about aprÃ¨s-ski.
Well, it's nice in the summer, too.
Oh, have you been?
Have you?
Have you?
Have you been, is the real question.
Have-have you been to Gstaad?
Wh I - What does it matter?
Just tell the truth.
Have you been there?
Have you been there?
- I'm sorry, have you?
- No, I haven't been there.
- Well  - Should I be ashamed of that, or can we all just tell the truth about whether we've been to "Shtaad".
Please.
It's "Gstaad".
- Shaad.
- Shtaad.
No one in this room has been to Gstaad.
Yeah, one more fan.
Just a little closer.
Okay, that'll do it.
You guys are suckers in there!
This is great!
Should we be worried about him?
Worried about Nick?
Oh, no, this is just what he does.
Okay, but being exposed to the heat for that long is actually super-dangerous, so maybe I should go reason with him.
"Reason".
Please excuse our immediate but correct response.
Oh, hey, hey.
Please just come into my room?
It's right there.
It's not even hot in reality.
You're obviously suffering from heat exhaustion.
It's like a crisp Vermont November.
Apple cider, football weather.
Don't jump in a pile of leaves.
: There might be a dead dog in there.
You're slurring your speech.
Soon you're gonna get dizzy, you're gonna get cramps.
Why do you care so much, Reagan?
Because you look like a dying man on a hospital show.
Oh, I know why.
Because you have a crush on me.
- No.
-  Yeah.
That's that I You're you're a human being and I'm worried about You have a crush on me.
No.
That's why you're always thinking about me That has nothing to do with that.
giving me my medicals, checking on me, giving me my medicals You said that twice.
You are hallucinating.
No, Reagan, I'm "ha-truth-inating".
Okay, you know what, I'm gonna have to smoke you out.
Ooh-hoo!
Smoke me out?
Turn 'em all on, great.
I love it hot.
Great, turn 'em up.
I got the sticks if you got the melons.
Marsh-melons.
Marshmallows.
Sorry.
: Hey, Deborah.
- Hey, Cece, now that now that we're - What?
Now that we're in the cool, have you rethought the audition?
Maybe you'll go now?
I mean, either way I love you, I just - Um, no.
- No, okay.
- Mm-mm.
- Okay, I still love you though.
: You leave me with no choice.
: What are you doing?
Ma'am!
I'm gonna ask that you please - remove your headphones now!
- What?
Do you know why I asked you to remove your headphones?
Why are you talking so loud?
Do you have a cranberry stuck in your ear again?
- Winston found his cop voice.
- Oh Ma'am!
Why are you avoiding an audition when you know damn well it's important to you?
Don't do this.
Get back in your vehicle, immediately!
Ma'am, please answer the question.
Why are you avoiding an audition?
And do not say that you are not, because I know that you are, so tell me why!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Why?
!
Now, damn it, speak!
What if I'm not good enough?
It's my dream job, and what if I can't do it, okay?
What?
Cece, you're the most talented Sir, stand down!
Winston, you stand down.
Go play softball against the fire department - or whatever it is you do.
- That's not till Wednesday.
- Honey, I was terrified.
- Don't worry don't My hands are shaking.
Block that out.
- I'm freaking out.
Yeah.
- Block that out.
Okay, let's plan a trip.
Something to look forward to.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Mother freckles.
Winston's wild.
God, that was so scary.
It was so terrible.
It's okay.
Can you just admit that it's hot in here?
There's no way that you are not hot.
I'm hot.
Why are you so worried about old Nicky pots and pans?
I don't have a crush on you.
You have a crush on me, it's obvious.
Why would I have a crush on you?
You are the most stubborn, annoying, frustrating person I have ever met in my entire life.
Why don't you tell that to the judge in your pants?
Verdict's in.
You're guilty.
Where are you going?
!
I'm shutting down your ranch.
Leave my ranch out of it!
Well, then I'm gonna do this, you idiot.
Whoa.
No, don't.
- Leave it alone.
-  Stop.
No, you don't   - What is going on?
!
- Damn!
Damn!
Reagan, please, let - Look, she's the one - Wh No, you're the one.
Now, get down to the basement and fix our power.
But the basement?
There are so many rats.
She'll probably try to make out with me.
Please, I would rather make out with a rat.
Gross.
Did you hear what she just said?
Stop!
Go to the basement - and stay there until the power is fixed!
- Yes, sir.
Now, I have accidentally pressed all of the buttons, but you will stay on the elevator until you get to the basement!
And when you get to that basement Aw, damn How is it even hotter down here Because the heat stays low, you dummy.
It's bad enough that we're down here, I can't explain science to you.
I hope that the Chicago Cubs win the World Series while you're in a coma.
That's one of the meanest things anybody has ever said to me.
We are visitors, let's act like it.
Hello, rats?
Hello?
!
I come to hurt ya.
Okay, for those who have not been scared off, I actually come in peace.
My name is Nick.
- I've been down here a lot.
- : Hello, Nicholas.
I'm Jeremiah.
- Sorry.
- Why would you?
- It's funny.
- Very clever.
You got really scared.
I'm not so scared, but don't ever do that again.
It's also a very good rat voice.
Thank you But it is a terrible rat name.
Jeremiah?
That would never be the name of a rat.
It's name is, like, Sushi.
Or "Ma-cushi".
Now, follow me.
I want to leave one set of footprints.
That is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.
Oh, hello, old friend.
Funny seeing you here.
Tick-tock.
Almost audition time.
- Hey, Cece.
- Huh?
You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?
You didn't mean that, right?
: Yeah, I did.
Newscasters are amazing.
But so are you.
Come on, Schmidt, okay?
I'm a bartender and a model.
: Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to step out of the vehicle.
- : Yes, do it, baby.
- "Vehicle"?
What vehicle?
The metaphorical vehicle that is holding you back.
- Oh.
- Don't explain yourself.
Just go with it.
You are a brilliant, amazing woman, - who is capable of anything.
- Okay, maybe drop the Southern accent.
: What, you got mozzarell in your ears?
You're, uh, get out of your own way, lady, huh?
Uh, tr-try, Law & Order uh, Hargitay.
I've got a past and it affects my job.
And my relationships I can't really do a Mariska.
What is happening here?
Cece, I know the audition is scary for you.
I would not be doing my job as the man who loves you if I let you walk away from this.
Don't blow it, Cece!
You are not walking away from this opportunity!
- Okay - I'm gonna need less talking out of you and more action, damn it!
: Wow.
Wait, no, Cece, I'm sorry.
- Did I take it too far?
-  I took it too far, didn't I?
Oh, God.
It's fine.
I have been down this road many a-times.
She's gonna come walking back through that door in three, two  Look, Schmidt, not for nothing, man, you got so many good characters inside of you.
: Oh, my gosh.
- Did you already bind the 120s?
- Yeah, this should do it.
Do what?
Cook you like barbecue chicken?
- I traced it back.
It's fine.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- It's not safe.
- Can you admit that I might actually be right about something for once?
- It's your own funeral; you win.
- Great.
- Don't do it!
- Nick!
Fine, let's just say you are right.
Then at least let me do it, okay?
You don't have to do that.
I want to do it.
I mean, I don't, like, want to do it, obviously, but  What if I'm wrong?
If you think this is right, it's probably right.
You've been, you've been right about a lot of stuff today.
Like what?
What else was I right about?
Just a lot of stuff.
I don't want to talk about what you were actually right about at this moment.
Okay, ready?
- Uh - If I get burned up and die this way, it would be such an embarrassing way to go.
But what would be nice about it is that I would technically have been right.
Here we go.
Heroes don't wear capes.
No, no, no  Those sons of bitches did it.
Hey, great!
Really good.
That was really great.
: What are you looking at?
Huge rat.
-  -   No!
No!
No!
This is my nightmare!
It's time.
How did I?
Did you carry me out like a firefighter?
No, you woke up right away.
And then you were like, "Ooh, I need some fresh air".
So we came outside, I bought you a muffin and then you passed out again.
Oh, yeah, I remember that muffin.
I feel like you had a pretty bad shock, so let's ask a few questions.
What day of the week is it?
That's not something I typically know.
I would guess Monday.
Okay.
Blackout.
ATM's are down.
Cash is king and batteries is queen.
What?
Stop being so whimsical, Winston.
Cece still hasn't called me back.
I think I pushed her too far.
No, Schmidt, you did the right thing, man.
Look, people get mad at police officers because we tell them what they don't want to hear.
Yet, everyone loves - police officer -  : Hey, it's a blackout, not the Rapture!
You yield!
All right!
-  - Hey, hey, hey, sir, sir!
Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!
Come on, right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, ma'am.
Right that way, ma'am.
Sir, go, go, go!
We ain't got all day!
Sir!
Cece.
- Right this way, ma'am.
Right that way, ma'am.
Thank God you're here.
Look I'm-I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, you should be.
You really pissed me off.
I wrote something rude on your car.
It was that stupid cop voice.
I shouldn't have pushed you that hard.
No, you should've.
'Cause you were right.
I was chickening out.
- So I went.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, that's amazing.
How did it go?
- Real bad.
Yeah.
- It went real bad?
Okay, well, you know what?
about it, baby, I'm sure No, no, no, no.
They just didn't It was, it was legitimately terrible but not because I'm not talented.
I went to the bar first so I was wasted and wearing shorts, which I won't do next time.
Thank you for pushing me.
We need to do that kind of thing for each other.
Yes, please.
I agree, unless, of course, it's about me using face wash all over my body.
- Ah, this again, really?
- I don't care that it's expensive.
- I know that you don't care.
- I'm just gonna keep on doing it.
-  - Oh, ice cream truck!
Oh!
Right this way!
Here we go, sir.
Here we go, sir.
Here we go, sir.
All right, stop!
Ice cream, man, open up.
Where the ice cream at?
Can I buy you some ice cream?
First, uh, I just want to revisit that little moment in the basement where you were like, "Hey, Reagan, you've been right about a lot of stuff today".
Really?
- I just want you to specifically tell me what You are out of control.
I've been right about.
You're a grown man.
I just think you should be - able to say it.
-  You dick.
I have a crush on you.
Hmm.
There it is.
I have a crush on you.
Isn't that better?
Now we can just put it behind us, move on, don't have to be weird.
No, I, obviously, I-I know it's not gonna be a problem, Reagan.
I don't have any illusion that you're gonna go for a guy like me.
I am a total mess.
I understand that.
I mean, you're-you're beautiful, and-and you're smart, and you're-you're mean, but in a hot way.
And-and you have the-the mind of a electrician, which is so confusingly hot, because that is not, like, a sexy We could both be stars Yeah, who knows?
We could fall apart Yeah, who knows?
Who knows?
All the things that we wanna be Excuse me, is your name Stephanie?
I'm supposed to be meeting somebody here.
It's Nick.
So, no Stephanie.
Hey, yo, Nick, you coming, man?
All that we do is, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Great.
Follow the world as it goes What is this, a frozen banana, Winston?
Okay.
While you're gassing up, let's look at the stock merkins.
Marts Nope!
Is this is this here?
Or is it more here?
Your frame?
Because I don't want to just be like, you know, a head that's like Scientists have discovered a new kind of butter.
Fly in the Amazon.
What the crap does that mean?
I'm so sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
You don't Is this?
I don't know who I borrowed this from.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 So your flight leaves tomorrow, so Yes, if we're ever gonna have sex, we gotta do it right now.
Now, what-what I was actually gonna say is do you want to print your boarding pass at the airport and use their ink instead of ours, but I like that yours ended with sex.
I said sex, but I meant meaningless sex.
Oh, I heard that.
That's what I heard.
I heard meaningless sex.
I'm gonna be in my room.
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Time-wise.
I'm not pitching positions.
Okay, great.
Holy Hi!
Oh, my God!
I am so sorry.
Nobody was here when I got home, and the bed just looked so good, I went full Goldilocks, and you must be Reagan!
It's so good to meet you.
I put on my special underwear, because - Nick!
- Jess is back!
And I made a promise to myself when you left I'd be wearing these when you came back!
- And I'm doing it.
- Oh, my God!
Thank you!
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
All right, great, I'm gonna get out of here.
- No, stay.
- Nah!
Nah!
The LA County Courthouse gift shop is straight up bull.
Can you believe I had to have these shirts made?
Yeah, I can believe that.
Where's Reagan?
Probably putting on her shirt still.
Yeah, Reagan's not exactly the matching T type.
I-I feel like the moment has passed, don't you?
- Yeah, I feel like it's so passed.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
That's the thing about moments, though.
They come and they go.
They're fleeting.
That's a moment.
This is a moment.
Which makes me believe that although that one passed, maybe it It's also just, um, I'm leaving tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- So we don't want to make it complicated.
I mean, right now we're just roommates that made out a couple of times.
Well, I'm glad we talked this out.
Now your last day here won't be weird.
Nothing about this conversation makes me believe that that is true.
Yeah.
Glad it's not gonna be weird.
Winston's weekly letters.
90% redacted, but still full of news.
"I'll leave you with my thoughts on the trial".
Big black line, big black line.
- They redacted that stuff?
- Big black line.
"LOL".
Big black line.
"Gotta go, or I'll be late for my first dance class".
You know, actually the dance class has become more of a dance gathering.
You know what, maybe Schmidt and I will join you, because the wedding is almost here, and we have to work on our first dance.
Come.
I mean, you know, two more referrals and I get to have my birthday party there.
- Hey, Reagan.
- Hello.
How was jury duty?
Jury duty was quite simply the tops.
Did I have a knack for it?
I suppose.
Was I elected foreman?
Unanimously.
Am I going on the news tomorrow to explain the verdict to laymen non-jurors?
You know I am.
- Nice!
- And yet, I nearly threw it all away for love.
His name was Juror 237B, and we made the courthouse our hothouse.
Blood splatters, mucous seeps.
But nothing could happen between us, because, as every American knows, personal contact through the exchange of personal information between members of a sequestered jury is strictly forbidden.
But I promised myself, once the trial had ended, I would find him.
Extra!
Extra!
"I'm gonna find that juror," vows Jessica Day!
Page two: It's war in the Pacific!
What?
!
Schmidt I Schmidt!
I need your help.
This is Reagan's last day.
I know it is, and you know what?
Whatever embarrassments or failures the rest of your life may hold, no one can ever take away what you've accomplished this week.
A goddess walked among us, and you went to first base with her.
Several times.
And I actually did a really good job kissing her.
But now I'm making it weird.
- No.
- Yeah, every time I open my mouth, I'm tarnishing my legacy a little bit.
But I have a plan.
I'm gonna shut up.
Love it.
I'm not finished yet.
There's more to my plan.
- Do you need more?
- Yes, I need more.
What more could there be?
Just shut up.
I'm going to shut up until we say good-bye.
And then I'm gonna hit her with a Goosebumps Walkaway.
I don't know who he is.
Is he an old-fashioned baseball player?
Goosebumps Walkaway is the line that they guy says to the girl in the movie that gives her goosebumps and then he walks away forever.
- It's that line that - That haunts her.
That consumes her.
That rings in her ear for all of eternity, granting you Immortality.
- You're damn right.
- Immortality.
Come here.
I want to say good-bye to you.
But it's not true.
So-so bad-bye, Reagan.
Bad bye.
Okay, that was terrible.
Now, go write 20 more.
Learn them, inhabit them, practice them, and then throw those away.
Then write another 20 and submit them to me for my approval.
Can bad-bye be one of them?
- No.
- So 40 new ones.
- Yeah.
- That's too that's excessive.
So, what is your plan for finding this guy?
I'm typing words I know about him into a computer.
Handsome plus Los Angeles plus 237B is a dead end.
Not if you're looking for Japanese adult film star, Handsome Los Angeles.
Born in February of 1937?
Handsome, tell me your secrets.
Looks like you are figuring that out.
So I'm gonna go anywhere else.
Hey, Jess.
- Hi.
- Hey, Reagan.
- Wow, you were in here.
- I was, yeah.
Anybody else back there?
If there was, I'd be terrified.
It's a small space.
So you and Jess are just talking.
I can only imagine what you guys are talking about.
- Well - I can't stand it for another second.
I have to address the 800-pound gorilla that's in this room.
It's elephant in the room.
800-pound gorilla is a different thing.
Okay, I guess I have to address the 800-pound elephant that's in the middle of the room.
It's just elephant.
The 800 pounds, that goes with the gorilla thing.
800 pounds is not a very big elephant.
Jess!
Reagan and I were romantic together.
Ooh.
I didn't know that.
Which means I've been romantic with both of you.
- Cool.
- And it's not just because you have brown hair and you've shared this room.
But because you're great, top-shelf ladies.
And I had the opportunity, and so I reached in the cookie jar, and I grabbed a chocolate chip and an oatmeal.
And I'm not saying who's who.
I've gotten off-track.
Your worlds must be turned absolutely upside down.
This must be devastating, as it is to me.
We're all feeling emotions we couldn't even begin to discuss.
A lot of us are having bad anxiety, and our legs are feeling weird and tingly.
I think we're fine with it.
I think it's great.
I'm really glad I came in here and, uh, talked about this.
I feel like we've gotten a lot of Great.
Mm-hmm.
Well Winston!
I didn't hear Winston.
He just screamed my name.
He needs help.
All right, I'm coming to save you.
That's the most embarrassed I've ever been for anyone not doing improv.
He's being so weird.
I gotta get out of here for the day.
Well, how would you like to drive around Los Angeles and look for a juror?
Thank you for being Reagan Travel to the car And find a juror Your heart is true, but you're not walking fast enough.
You and Nick, tell me everything.
The power went out.
We went into the basement.
There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.
Oh, my God.
And you like him.
No.
No, I don't.
We just hooked up a few times.
Let's focus on you.
Here's a courtroom sketch.
Yep, there he is, 237B.
God, he can dress.
But we're gonna need more than that.
We need something distinctive, so did he have like a he walked with a limp or he had a hook hand or a neck tattoo anything?
No.
He was perfect.
We all were.
Except for the guy sitting next to him, 9C ugh.
What was wrong with him?
He never got why Bunt v. Che was a relevant precedent.
Also he wheezed a lot.
Like the door of a haunted house.
He has asthma.
We can find that guy and see if he knows anything.
I used to peddle inhalers.
What color was his?
Oh, uh red.
Like the door of a haunted house!
Sorry.
The only group excursion we took was to a haunted house.
By the way, if you like haunted houses but hate lines, January's a great time to go Dr. Foley?
Reagan Lucas.
I was just calling to ask you if you were still handing out samples of Ciliabreez?
Six months after the recall?
Oh, dang.
Jim?
Nothing more bad-ass than calling a doctor by his first name.
Sorry.
All I need from you is the name of a patient.
What is this, Winston?
Who are all these unusual people?
Where's the instructor?
It is a gathering, not a class.
I've told you that before.
Listen, it's fun.
That's not dancing.
These people aren't dancing.
Dancing is about precision and domination and sweat.
Check out my ass.
Check out my ass!
My butt is alive!
We're not gonna learn our first dance here.
I'm gonna call my Beijing Opening Ceremonies contact.
- He's fantastic.
- No, no, no.
Look, I always imagined that our first dance would just be you and me having the time of our lives.
- Very choreographed time of our lives.
- No.
Having fun that's how I want to start our lives together.
Can you please just try?
Please?
Yeah, I'll-I'll-I'll try.
Just listen to the music.
- Let it build.
- Let it build.
Got to let it wash over you Oh, there's the wave!
Let it wash over me on the three count?
Yes!
I think so.
It's happening.
It's happening.
Well, just teach me the steps and I'd be happy to join in.
There are no steps.
What dance are you guys doing?
Because it is not Humpty's!
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name This is his dance, y'all!
And Humpty Hump is his name!
During Cece's first wedding, Nick and I went into a duct to catch a badger that Winston had released.
- Naturally.
- It was crazy!
It was chaotic!
It was largely Nick's fault.
But then I realized he's the only person I'd ever go into a duct with.
Nick kind of sneaks up on you.
You think he's one thing and then Yeah, Nick is great.
But I'm leaving and we're both cool about that so Oh, right, you're both totally cool about it.
I get Goosebumps Walka Okay, okay, just think okay.
Oh, wait, Reagan, before you go!
"Wherever the fridge of life takes you" You came in, I liked you, then you left!
What, what is that?
!
Stop thinking that this is good-bye.
And start knowing it as bye bye.
Pretend I didn't do the "byes".
So, Dr. Foley says our guy spends all of his time here.
With all this grass, no wonder his asthma is bad.
Oh, hey!
There he is!
Hey, 9C!
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
You do not run my life anymore.
Good-bye!
Is that adult man afraid of you?
I take a bathroom break when I want to!
I cracked skulls as foreman.
Whoa, whoa.
"Men only"?
!
It's 2016!
Clearly, I make the rules.
That's why my office is a hut.
Fine, we'll get a man.
So, Winston didn't answer.
Schmidt said, "They're desecrating the Time Warp.
Desecrating it"!
And he hung up.
But I got a hold of Nick.
He said that he's super busy, which means he's naked and doodling.
But he said he'd make time for us, which is good.
- Wait, sorry, so Nick is coming?
- Yeah.
No, just call him and tell him not to come.
I thought you were cool.
I am cool.
You don't really seem cool.
It's just that when I see him, it's a, it's weird, - Mm-hmm.
- 'cause I'm, I'm leaving and it's, it's complicated.
- I do I just, I don't really know how to - Right.
God, I'm crazy about him!
Yes!
I knew it!
- I knew it.
- Okay, yes.
That's enough.
You're right.
You know what happens now.
I don't want to hug you.
You know what happens now!
I'm not hugging you.
Yeah, you are.
I'm not hugging you.
You know the other juror's name?
I think it was 237B.
- What's that guy's name, yeah?
- Oh, yeah, no.
- I really, really can't.
It's like - Nah I like that guy, really?
- What's the name of the juror?
- No!
Calls hand sanitizer "ham sanitizer".
- Tell me the name and I'll give you the hat!
- Quit it!
Quit it!
He calls DNA "D and A." You want grass stain on this white hat?
!
Please no.
But he kisses you like a coal miner greeting his wife.
After a day in the caves.
Did they go into caves?
- 237B is Gary Garcia!
- Gary?
- I'm not jumping this!
Let's go!
- You get back here!
Gary Garcia!
Look at her out there.
Treating the laws of music as mere suggestions of music.
Must be frightening to love a daredevil.
What happened to you?
Growing up a husky boy, I learned that I had no margin for error.
Hey, fatty, it's called "The Hustle".
The slightest mistake meant ridicule, so I had to learn to do everything perfectly.
I learned to dance a dance the way that it was meant to be danced.
And until I learned to dance that dance perfectly, I would never dance that dance.
And then exactly 364 days later Do The Hustle!
- Do the Hustle - Sock it, man!
Go!
Whoa!
No complaints here, fatty.
No complaints.
Let me ask you a question about this mean kid at the talent show was he a child emperor?
No, he was as poor and trashy as they come.
So he had no power over you then or now.
Schmidt, you got to stop letting childish ridicule dictate your actions.
Oh, yeah, well, your-your smelly butt looks dumb in those pants.
- Hello?
- Winston, I need you to run a name through the system.
That's a real thing, right?
Yeah, nice vest!
Hey, look, Bishop altered his uniform again.
Poor guy.
It's a bloodbath.
He'll live.
Come here, come here, come here.
Come here!
So, here's my plan.
I knock on Reagan's door and the moment before she says good-bye, I give her the Goosebumps Walkaway of your choosing, and then I walk away.
- What direction?
- What direction?
Do I, uh?
Do you go left, right or backwards?
Left, le uh, left!
Nick.
Uh, right, right.
- Backwards.
- Left is a great choice.
'Cause that's what I started with.
- Left is a great choice.
- Thank you, man.
That's, that was my instinct, left.
And I would read that one.
That's 'cause this is a perfect one.
When are you gonna tell him how you feel?
Never.
I'm still leaving.
What would be the point of telling him how I feel when nothing can possibly come from it?
So there are 28 guys named Gary Garcia.
- Great, I can do that.
- That's not bad.
- Really?
On that piece of paper.
931 in the system; still printing.
Are you sure that Gary didn't have something distinctive about him?
Just a smile big and wide, like the door of a haunted house.
Boy, was I wrong.
Gary Garcia.
In my mind, he was Lawrence from Torrance.
In your wildest fantasies, he lives in Torrance?
Lawrence from Torrance, not Lawrence of Torrance.
He was born in Torrance, but now he lives in Brentwood.
Lawrence of Brentwood.
Kind of sounds like the sponsor at the end of a game show.
Yeah.
"Pat Sajak's wardrobe furnished by Lawrence of Brentwood".
Yeah.
This is why you should tell Nick how you feel.
Even if nothing comes of it.
So you won't end up like me.
I never told Gary how I feel, and now I never can.
You can, and you should.
Don't let Miller become your Garcia.
Hi, Nick.
I want to say something to you before we say good-bye.
Shh Ew.
Sayonara, Sammy.
Sayonara.
What?
That's the shower.
I know it is.
Hello and good morning.
Hello and good morning.
You okay?
It's not so bad if I don't think about the trial.
Trial, trial, trial, trial Hello and good morning!
Today, more on that trial that's been captivating Los Angeles.
Joining us is the trial's foreman.
Thank you for being here, ma'am.
Thank you for having me, Alan; I'm a big fan.
Also with us, via satellite, is another member of the jury.
- No way it's him!
- Whoa What are the odds?
Well, exactly one in 11, Nick.
Juror Please, please, oh, my God, please.
237B.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Welcome, sir.
- It's good to be with you, Alan.
Let's start Gary!
Gary, it's me!
- Gary!
- Madam Foreman?
Is that you?
Yes!
I'm Jess and I like you!
I'm Gary and I like you, too.
There it is!
Man, they sound like Cookie Monster's parents.
How do I get in touch with you?
It's gargar It's G-A-R-G-A-R, like Gary with no "Y"s, - twice, no spaces.
- Someone get me a freakin' pen!
@historicbrentwood.
info.
Oh, my God.
Wait!
Did you say Brentwood?
Historicbrentwood.
info.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
Gary of Brentwood.
"J" as in Jack, "D" as in dog Should she be giving out her personal information on TV?
I mean at verdicts get appealed.
And killers go free.
Eh, hard to be killed over e-mail.
and I live at 310 Traction Avenue, - apartment 4D.
- Easy to be killed in your home.
You know where to find me!
I need to see you now!
Okay, I know exactly where to go.
Stay tuned for your eight-day forecast with Crispin Saint Chang.
Jess did it right.
She said something real.
And I said "Sayonara, Sammy".
Who the hell is Sammy?
All right, man.
I'm gonna take off.
I gotta head to the station before my dance gathering.
You can't go to the station like that.
They'll make fun of you.
When are you gonna stop worrying about what people say?
When I look into my suggestion box, it is full.
People have a lot to say about the way I live my life.
But there is only one comment card that I pay attention to.
And you know what that card says?
It says, "Great job.
Keep it up".
And you know who filled out that card?
Me.
You know how I know?
Because I recognize my motherfreakin' handwriting.
Now that's a Goosebumps Walkaway.
I can do this.
Right?
Yes, I can do this.
Oh, what Hey, I was just about to call you.
Nick, look, there's something that I wish I would've said to you last night, but I didn't, so I'm gonna say it right now.
Sayonara, Sammy.
Those are such beautiful words.
I'm Sammy.
- Hello?
- Reagan I'm gonna need some time to process everything you just said.
Yeah.
I really put myself out there.
Yeah.
I Hey in light of recent events, I think it's important that we have each other's current information.
I mean, I know I have your phone number because I just dialed it and I have your address because I lived there.
'Cause Jess said it on TV.
I've got a flight to catch.
Me, too.
Bye, Nick.
We did it.
Thank God.
Yeah.
Need some sleep.
Good night, buddy.
So, we're totally free to talk about anything.
- Totally.
- Yeah.
Like, any thing.
Any thing at all.
Yes.
Gah!
What are you doing here?
Well, it's been six weeks since we've talked and I was ready to talk.
You and Gary looked great on television.
Well, that's how I want you to remember us: Blurry and talking like Zuul.
Well, then, mission accomplished?
Hey, did Reagan say anything to you?
Yeah, she actually did.
She said, uh, "Sayonara, Sammy".
Does that mean anything?
No, but whatever it means will factor heavily into tonight's Nick-on-Nick time.
I don't want to know - what Nick-on-Nick time is.
- Masturbating.
Way more information than I wanted.
Everybody does it three or four times a day.
Three or four times I'm talking about masturbating.
But never am I fully into it physically.
What?
I missed you, kid.
Missed you, too.
God, your nose hairs have gone totally bananas.
I'm gonna get my scissors.
Cece, I'd like to show you something that I have not been working on.
I will not.
You do the hustle, you stupid bossy song.
I'm doing this for fun.
You know I gave him the courage to do this?
Well, maybe you could give him the courage to stop.
I missed you guys!
No choreography, you guys!
Just keep it loose and fun!
Oh, it's the best time of my life!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Okay, well, it's too small to be a cat hotel and it's too big to be pants.
So it's not mine.
Me neither.
I pick up all my deliveries at the port.
- The what?
At the port?
- Yeah.
What are you doing at the port?
Picking up my deliveries.
Listen.
You drive all the way down to the port?
- Yes.
- Well, it's not mine.
I only buy local.
Except, of course, for clothing and produce.
Medication, - water, seasoning, meat.
- Maybe it's Cece's.
- Isn't she packing up her apartment?
- It's not Cece's.
She's packing right now, and Jess is going over there later to toast the place good-bye.
'Cause they're adorable.
- Would you consider us adorable?
- No, we're adult men.
We're cute.
Oh, hey!
My box is here.
- Do you need help?
- Oh Yeah, I was just gonna put it Put it down right there.
- Awesome.
- Jess, is it me, or has your job become a poo poo festival?
No, it's fine.
It's just the new principal, Becky Cavatappi.
She took over for Foster when he retired.
I do all her work and she does all the working of her cleavage.
But the budget's your job, Becky.
Ah Principal Cavatappi.
Like I always say: don't call me Becky unless you're riding me like a horse.
We work in a middle school.
Really.
This is the budget, or the next week of my life.
You know what they say your life is just weeks and then you die.
Uh, Jess, - are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
I just got this for a little stress relief.
-  - Oh, Schmidt, will you be a dear and text Cece and tell her I'm gonna be about, like, ten minutes late?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
Aah!
Becky!
Becky!
I hate you!
Hi!
- Hello.
- Look who I brought.
The French.
Bonjour.
Oh, it's Prosecco, it's Italian.
So grazie.
Oh, it's Polish Prosecco.
So that's on me for buying it at a gas station.
Long week of work ahead of me.
- I'm looking forward to a fun night!
- Okay, Jess, I should tell you before I I know I said I was done packing, but I'm not done, and the reason I'm not done is because I didn't do anything, and I have to get out before tomorrow, otherwise I lose my deposit.
Oh, Cece.
- I know.
- Cece, Cece, Cece.
Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece, Cece - Hey, guys.
- Hey, Winston.
I did it.
I told Aly I need a new partner.
- What?
I thought you had a crush on her.
- Yeah.
Well, exactly.
You know, here's the problem.
She keeps talking about her boyfriend and his "ass that you want to open on Christmas".
- What?
- But it's fine.
You know, she took it better than I thought.
Screw you.
Here's your crap: lucky crystal, key chain fart marker, over a hundred yogurt tops, your flattened penny collection, a signed copy of a Paul Reiser biography, baby carrot thumb drive, a picture of you and Dave Coulier, loose Pez, my mom's cell number, a ticket stub from Urinetown.
When did you even see that?
- Why?
Why?
- Oh, have you Have you tried 'em on?
Oh, and your Pure Mood CD.
This thing makes me want to swim into a boat motor.
-  - Oh new partner's here.
Guys, as they say, when one chapter ends, a bridge appears, and then you cross that bridge and make lemonade out of a molehill.
Okay.
Hiya, partner.
That's, uh, "hi" in karate.
Hiya!
-  - That's cool.
You don't mind if we listen to some car jams, do you?
Well, man, let's just get right to track seven.
- Elations - Elation Elations Elation.
- Elation, elation - Elation.
Oh!
- I'm okay, it's fine, it's fine, yeah.
- You okay, you good?
It's not gonna end well for these two.
I wouldn't trust him to watch a ball pit.
Hey, could I get a cream soda?
Dude, we both know what you're gonna do.
Don't.
It's not cool.
What?
We have a flasher.
You know what, maybe if we get drunk, then magically everything will just happen.
No, no.
No drinking until you've packed.
Look, I get that you're freaking out about moving, but we can do this.
We need to make a keep pile and a toss pile, okay?
Keep or toss, keep or toss.
-  - Ugh.
Uh Hi, Becky.
Sorry, Principal Cavatappi.
Jess, remember that binder?
Yeah.
Yup, I've got it right here.
I'll have it done by the end of the week.
Yeah, I mixed up the budget due date.
I took my contacts out 'cause they're ugly.
So I kind of can't read stuff.
I'll need it tomorrow.
Um Uh, yeah, uh, but it's a week's worth of work.
You get it done or you're fired.
I have to do a week's worth of work in a night.
So we got to get through this quick.
Keep or toss, keep or toss.
Cece, that sweatshirt has a wine stain on it and an off-brand Looney Tunes character.
George Bunny?
Who the hell is that?
You're right.
Keep.
- Toss!
- No, keep, keep!
I'm calling the cops.
There is a man pulling out his privates - in our bar.
- Oh, big whoop.
It used to be worse.
It used to be more interactive.
- What do mean, interactive?
- Interactive.
- You showed, too?
- No, it was more like tennis, like  Exit.
What's the second   Now it's just  And I'm This is a problem.
Wi-Winston.
New partner is working out great, man.
You know, we have a lot in common.
Both have cats, both partially blind me, color, him, night.
Well, that sounds dangerous.
Winston, listen to me.
We have some very serious police business here.
The bar has a flasher.
A strange man is regularly showing Nick his funky soup bone.
I'm sure he doesn't even care.
I care about that greatly, Nick.
I will be right there.
- Whoa, partner.
- Oh, oh, - oh, my goodness.
Hey, didn't see - Seat's taken.
- the seat was taken there, Winston, I - Yeah, I usually ride shotgun because I get motion sickness as a decision-maker.
Yeah, well, I lose all hand strength with absolutely no warning.
Just Damn it.
Mm I'm sorry, I'll be fast.
Mm Mm Mm Time's up.
It's a toss.
No, that was actually an award.
- Toss.
Next.
- Jessica Now, okay, look, that hat has a very important memory.
Hey.
I-I'm sorry I'm so bad at doggy-style.
Do you really want to remember Sir Miss-A-Lot?
This is all important stuff from my single life.
I think I need to go through the pile again.
You know what, you're right.
Let's go through everything again.
Can you just come with me to the hallway and take a look at a pile I made out there?
Oh, yeah, okay.
- I just really appreciate it.
- Mm-hmm.
I know you got a lot of work to do.
Yeah, so it's  I have to finish packing so I can work on the binder!
You made me do this!
I'm shutting this tiny door!
- Jessica, open the door!
- You're a terrible packer!
Jessica, open the door!
Your favorite team is the Green Bay Not Packers.
Let me in, okay?
Because, you know, if I'm out here too long, I'm gonna run into Hey, neighbor, you dig turtles?
It's not a big deal.
I've been flashed by, like, seven or eight different people since college.
- What?
- You guys have been flashed?
- No.
- Never.
Everybody's been flashed - countless times, right?
- No.
Oh, it's just me who's been flashed about 300 times?
- What?
- You guys have never been flashed?
- No.
- Never.
Not even on, like, holidays?
No!
Not even, like, after the Olympics?
Hey, guys, I still can't find the bathroom.
Where did you guys say it was again?
This place is like a maze.
Dunston, it's it's one big room, buddy.
Never mind.
I don't have to go anymore.
No, no, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.
You've had, like, two tubs of soda.
You-you need to go.
Yeah, I do have to go.
It's right back there to the left.
- Okay.
- Yeah, right past the pop Someone call about a flasher?
Oh.
Just responding to a call about a flasher.
Oh, yes.
Uh, there is no need.
Dunston and I have got this, so Oh, how is Dunston?
- Huh?
I hear he's blind and weird.
- No.
No, he's great.
- Ah.
- Dunston gets it done ston.
And that's how we win..
ston!
-  Oh.
-  - How are you?
- Really good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, Hutch is one hell of a cop.
I'm very strong.
Punch my stomach.
Try.
- I mean, I will.
- It won't hurt.
- : Okay.
- It won't hurt.
- : God.
- Mm-hmm.
That's amazing.
- Dunston.
Bathroom.
- Yeah?
Oh, that's right.
- Dunston?
- Ah.
- Dunston?
- No, I know.
-  - You're in good hands.
- I hope you're happy, too.
- Great!
- Great!
- Great.
Great!
Somebody call the G8 Summit because I just felt the climate change.
I don't get that.
Hmm.
Excuse me.
You know where the bathroom is?
- It's not back here.
- Right.
If you throw out one more thing, I am gonna hurl my body against the door!
Okay, fine, I am gonna do it.
I hope I don't hurt myself!
: Ow!
You think I don't know those were hands?
- That was a slap sound!
- Yeah.
Okay, you're right, it's a slapping sound, but I-I think I overdid it and I really hurt my wrist.
It's, like, swelling.
I'm telling the truth, okay?
It really hurts.
Just, can you please open the door?
- And now my wrists are fine!
-  You snake!
You rattlesnake!
-  Oh, my God, everything's gone.
- Look, Cece, I know you're freaking out about leaving the apartment, but if you think of it like No.
It's just, it's not just the apartment.
It's just it's it's all of it.
Everything is changing!
I'm not gonna have this place anymore, and I'm getting married.
Oh, my God, Jess, I'm getting married.
Are you having second thoughts?
No, no.
I I know I want to marry Schmidt more than anything in the world.
It's just everything is gonna change, and I am scared.
Oh, honey.
Oh, my little breakfast link.
Okay, now, look, we don't have time for this.
Okay, you have to work on your binder.
Forget the binder.
Right now this is more important.
- So you know what we're gonna do?
- What?
We're gonna get into it!
- I'm gonna take my pants off!
- What?
Why?
- So, Nick, can you describe the suspect?
- Mr. Miller, can you describe the suspect?
Uh, are you doing the interview, or?
Oh, yeah, I'm usually the interview guy.
- Oh, that's okay.
- No, you can take it.
- I'll take it, dude, if it's not a big deal.
- Hey, well, it can be either No, I'm used to it, too, but you're used to it, so it's not a big deal for me.
Well, I mean, I'm used to it, but I'm open to new things.
Okay, yeah, but to the count of three.
- Just-just-just please - We're just gonna do it.
One, two, three.
- You do it.
- I can I'm gonna go.
He was average size, thin, wispy blond hair.
Oddly shaped, kind of came to a point.
- Uh, what does that mean?
- Top heavy.
A bit of a scar as if like from a hook or something.
Gross.
Ugh.
Uh, anything else?
I think that about does it.
You want me to describe what his face and body looked like?
Yeah, that'd be Wait.
Have you been describing his penis this whole time?
All right, that's it.
I'm done.
I'm not even the one that called you guys.
Man!
And to be fair, I knew he was talking about a penis the whole time.
See?
That is way too real!
Aggressively detailed.
I had to guess on the testicles, 'cause he hadn't described 'em.
You know what it is?
It's just that there's no turning back.
I mean, who am I when I leave this apartment?
"Mrs. Cece Schmidt"?
"Cece Schmidt" sounds like the mayor of an evil Swiss town.
It does.
Oh, my God.
Did I tell you that Schmidt thinks that we should drop our last names and make up a new one?
He is currently, at the moment, leaning towards Zenith and Telluride.
I don't hate Telluride.
Getting married is just such a big leap.
You leap big all the time!
You moved here at 18 with nothing but a bunch of chokers.
Isn't it amazing?
!
And it's mine.
Yeah, there's also a knife stuck in the wall.
Oh, look!
Someone left a spoon with some rock candy in it.
I wonder what flavor it is.
- This is a way bigger leap.
-  Ugh!
Becky!
You sloppy boob lizard!
Principal Cavatappi!
Oh, yeah, the binder.
Yup, I've got it right here.
- : Where's the binder?
-  Um, yeah, uh, sorry.
Uh Um, yeah, I've got it right here.
: Find it.
Find it.
You packed it somewhere?
!
- Yeah, I can turn to page 13.
Hold on.
- Oh.
Chuka.
Chuka, chuka, chuka.
- Chuka.
- : What is that?
That was a page-turning noise.
- Chuka, chuka - Um, yup, I see the graph.
Chuk, chuka, chuk, chuk!
- Jess?
-  Do you remember Rosarito?
!
We don't have much to go on, but I'll run your description.
Hopefully, Dunston wouldn't have spilled coffee all over the radio.
You know, he brews his own and drinks it out of a sandwich bag.
Winston, just call Aly and tell her that you want to be partners again.
Ugh.
Look, guys, I I cannot.
I just cannot hear about Aly's boyfriend and his ass that don't quit, okay?
My ass don't quit!
What about my ass?
!
- Winston, please call Aly.
- Seriously, dude.
- There he is.
-  Hey, do you have - any, uh?
- Freeze, buddy!
Oh, yeah, freeze!
Wait!
Hey!
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Yeah!
Got him!
All right!
Dunston!
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, man.
I'm not normally - the cuff guy, but I'll do it.
- Yeah, me, either.
- But I'll do it.
- One size fits all, right?
- Yeah, I guess it's - Man, I just said, - I'll be the cuff guy!
- I'm not normally the cuff But, yeah, but if I'm not normally the Then if you're not but I'm not normally.
- Now, I'm doing - Okay, okay, count of three.
Count of three.
- Who is the cuff guy?
One.
- All right.
One.
Two, three, four.
- Five, six.
See?
- Five.
Mm.
- All right.
Three.
- Three.
Two, one, - zero, negative one.
Damn it!
- That!
Winston, Dunston!
Dunston!
Go!
Hey!
I got to say he never comes in twice in a night.
I just hope he's okay.
I'm alarmed by how connected to this man you feel.
I just hope the best for him.
I am so dead.
If I don't find this binder, I'm gonna - need a really good excuse.
Oh, wait, Cece?
- Mm.
Can you break my arm just a little bit?
- No!
- You're right.
It's better if I do it myself.
Okay, you know what?
Hey!
Hey, can I just throw something out there?
What if you quit?
I want to quit.
God, do I want to quit, but I can't!
I can't!
You can quit.
Because this Becky lady is making you miserable.
You were always someone who loved their job.
It's my first day of teaching in L.A. And I'm giving my job A big fat "A" You remember the last time I was unemployed?
I ran out of things to knit.
- I knit a condom.
- Oh, the yarn-dom.
- I pray this was never used.
- Okay, remember earlier when you told me to leap?
You should leap.
I don't leap.
I take small planned steps, like an arthritic dog.
Really?
The last listing is a loft downtown.
Bad area.
The ad just says it's "sunsoaked and beige-y".
I don't know.
They seem like three nice girls.
And now I am marrying one of those girls and totally freaking out about it.
You know who you need to talk to, right?
- Yes.
Definitely.
Winston.
- No.
- What the hell?
- What?
I'm gone for two months, and all of a sudden Winston's a bridesmaid?
Never mind.
- You need to call Schmidt.
- No.
No, I can't call him and tell him that I'm scared.
I think that that's what getting married is.
Sharing all this, all the things you're afraid of, all the things that embarrass you, weak doggy-style guy.
You got to call Schmidt.
All right.
-  - A voice call, Jess?
Let me guess, a family of ducks is crossing the street.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's me.
It's me.
Um, so okay, um, I love you but I am freaking out about getting married.
Cece, what?
What's-what's going on?
What's happening?
- Well, I just I don't I don't -  Oh, no.
Um, Jess, it's Becky.
It's Becky.
What-what-what do you want me to do?
- What do I do?
What do I do?
- Don't answer it.
Don't answer it.
What?
Who's Becky?
What's a Becky?
What's happening?
Don't answer it.
Do not answer it.
I'm gonna answer it.
What?
Hello!
Hi.
Uh, yeah, so, this is Cece Parikh, and you are treating my friend very badly.
What?
Put Jess on.
No, no, no, no.
You are done using my friend, okay?
So she quits.
I what?
She what?
- I what?
- That's right!
Jess quits!
Nailed it!
Oh, my God, the binder.
It's under the couch.
No, no, no.
We handled it.
It's our perp.
Aly, I want you back.
I - I-I want you back.
- Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?
I miss having you as my partner.
Do you want to tell me why you left?
'Cause you never did.
And, honestly, Winston, that really sucked.
I left because you hurt my feelings when you kept talking about You kept talking about how much you hate my music.
You know?
This is about your Pure Moods CD?
That's it.
That's all.
It's the only reason why I left.
Okay.
I mean, that thing makes me wish I was born without the ability to hear music, but if it means that much to you, I'll listen to it.
I-I-I appreciate that.
Look, you're the only partner I want.
You make me laugh and whatever.
I don't know.
I suck at compliments.
Yeah.
Partners?
Partners.
Shake it.
Don't just hold it.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I think that was Dunston.
- How did he not see us?
- No idea.
Oh, yeah, he's night-blind.
Dunston!
It's done.
Everything you asked for.
And, Principal Cavatappi, I'm very sorry for what my friend said.
I Oh, I know.
I would never let you quit anyway.
Can you come up with some thoughts on the science curriculum for the superintendant and sign my name?
Yeah.
Sure.
Yes.
You know what?
No!
I can't.
No.
Nope.
Um, because I quit.
I hope you have a minor career setback, learn from it, relocate, and ultimately have a very nice life, Becky.
Mmm.
Do I want to know this story?
I hope so, because we're about to spend the rest of our lives together.
So you're gonna have to hear all my stories.
I want to spend the rest of my life hearing all your stories.
Until, of course, my hearing goes out and I get tinnitus.
Do you know Dave Letterman has tinnitus?
Um About-about what I said on the phone I'm a little freaked out, too.
- You are?
- Yes.
And it has nothing to do with how much I love you.
Exactly.
Or how much I want to get married.
Exactly.
We'll be scared together.
And we'll be really happy together, too.
And we'll be really annoyed together, knowing that we're living with three other people and a cat.
Also, I think there's another cat.
Winston's being very evasive about it, but Mmm.
It's a foster cat.
I think it's helping him get over the whole Aly thing.
I don't care.
Well, I guess this is it.
I thought Jess would be here, but - you know, okay, end of an era.
- Yeah.
: Have you ever been here before?
This is maybe my second time.
I nursed my pippy back to health here.
: Yeah.
I remember.
All right.
I'm gonna give you a minute.
Okay.
Cece, Cece, Cece.
Do you want to do the honors or should I?
Hmm Go for it.
Okay.
One, two, three.
-  We did it!
-   Oh, my God, there's hair on the end!
Put it back!
Put it back!
Do you speak Russian?
Nope.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 I need your advice on these wedding invites.
I like calligraphy option number two; it looks like a Bone Thugs album.
This looks like an ad for a bong company.
I like option one better.
You know what would be nice?
A wedding invitation engraved on a plate.
What a magical wedding that would be.
You two are imbeciles.
Anybody with taste and sophistication would always choose option number two.
Are you okay?
You look gray.
I didn't sleep.
I was up preparing for an epic day of wedding decisions.
I'm calling it D-Day.
Of course, in this situation, the "D" stands for "decisions," and unlike the other D-Day, it will not be a walk on the beach.
That's incredibly offensive.
- I know.
-   Do you guys remember that audition I had for gas station TV?
Well, the girl they hired went missing - and they need me to fill in!
- Yeah!
- What?
- Oh!
-  Oh, my God, we're gonna be friends with a gas celebrity!
That's right!
But it is today, and I know you need my help with the wedding stuff Cece, what are you talking about?
Are you crazy?
You have to go to this.
I can do it all by my by myself.
Are you okay?
Wow, your mouth has been open forever.
Okay, this is crazy.
I'm just gonna stay home.
- No, Cece, you have to go, please.
- It's it's - Okay.
- I'll be fine.
I'll be fine.
I can help with wedding stuff.
Just lighten the load a little bit.
Sometimes I think I was bred in a lab to help people.
You know what else they bred in the lab?
Pugs.
Thank you, Jess.
That would be great.
Uh, no, Cece.
I don't have time to bring her up to speed.
Throwing her into the fray now would be like putting a baby on a treadmill.
She would just shoot off.
Baby, you're just being protective of the wedding, okay?
Jess is just gonna help.
She's not gonna take over.
Mmm Jess Mmm mm mm mmm.
What's happening here?
Fine.
Who's excited?
There we go.
Ooh, FYI, you may have to wrestle a rectal nutrient into him.
- Wait, what?
- You're right.
Not your job.
I've done it before.
I mean, I didn't like it, but I did it.
Am I proud of it?
No.
Did I do it?
Yes.
Have I done it again since?
No.
There's tons to do today, so we're going to have to split up.
I have to be here for a tux fitting and a meeting with a napkin ring genius.
Gonna be fine.
There's chairs to be picked and  cakes to be tasted.
Schmidt?
Are you asleep?
What?
!
No, I'm not sleeping, of course I'm not sleeping!
Just tons too much to do today to sleep.
Jess this is the most important thing that I own.
It is the wedding flash drive.
Everything that you need to know is on this.
It's color-coded.
Ooh, color-coded.
Gimme.
Please do not reach for it like you're Winston reaching for someone's breast.
Treat it with respect.
I will, and I just want to say I'm honored you're trusting me.
Oh, I'm not.
Everything I see is terrible.
Pan left.
This one's nice.
Comfortable, but not too comfortable.
- We want people to dance.
- Folding chairs?
Jess, if I wanted my wedding to be an AA meeting, I would've called my Aunt Terry.
I don't think you want to marry this guy.
Who is that?
Oh, finally.
Winston, where have you been?
I've been waiting an hour.
Work was crazy, okay?
I busted a poker room, which was a front for a crack house, which was a front for a brothel.
It was a crime turducken.
This is the third time you've stood me up.
Meat lunch is our oldest and proudest tradition.
Let's do this every year for the rest of our lives.
I'm gonna be a lawyer.
Let's eat.
I can't.
I had an hour, I gotta go back to work.
I mean You know, it's a it's a bar in the middle of the day.
Like, who's there?
Why are they there?
Why do you need to be there?
'Cause it's my job.
It runs itself.
It's basically a big-ass fridge.
I'm a bartender and owner.
You know how many balls I have to juggle now?
Man, those are baby balls.
- Hmm.
- I'm a cop.
I spend my day working the city's balls.
- Listen to yourself.
- Those balls are big.
Listen to yourself.
I'm listening to myself, Nick.
Your balls, in comparison to my balls, that you have to deal with, that I have to handle If you think your job is so much harder than my job, then why don't you come see for yourself?
Unless, of course, you're scared.
- Scared?
- Scared.
I'm a cop.
I run a bar.
Welcome to the nerve center.
Over here, you've got accounts payable bills, to the layperson and over here is the schedule.
It's a numbers game, really.
Who works when and why, square pegs, round holes, every man is a mystery That's great, Nick.
Um, I'm a cop.
-  - Come in!
Hey, Nick, what's the schedule for the weekend?
Oh, great, everybody's here.
Why don't you ask my friend Winston?
He'll be handling all questions.
Yeah, that's easy.
All right.
I'm ready to taste cakes.
Okay, great.
- This is gonna be fun.
- I'm sorry, fun?
Baking scones with Winston is fun.
This is serious, Jess.
Mmm!
Soft and sweet.
What a relief it's not hard and salty.
How is the nose?
Does it have a clean finish, or would you say it's a long cake?
Describe the cake's legs in terms of mouth feel.
Bro, I spent two hours at the chair place.
You picked nothing.
You negotiated with the florist until all three of us were crying.
Let's start again and put the camera close to the frosting.
And for God's sakes, please, be mindful of your friggin' shadow.
No.
I'm stopping this.
You're stop you're stopping what?
J-Jess?
What are what are you doing?
Why am I looking at a fountain now?
What What a relaxing water feature.
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa My body's saying let's go Oh-oh, whoa-oh, whoa Are they playing Christina there?
But my heart's saying no If you want to be me with me Baby, there's a price to pay I'm a genie in a bottle You gotta rub me the right way If you want to be with me Hey, gal pal, how is it going?
Great!
It's exactly like modeling, except for it's less cold and I get to talk.
How's Schmidt?
He's not stress-eating paper towels again, is he?
No, everything's fine.
I'm supposed to see a beverage guy, but I can't find his address.
Seriously?
I can come back and help.
- No!
- It's fine.
It's just Schmidt has this color-coded system, and I can't figure out which one.
Do you know which one beverages would be?
I don't know.
Blue?
You're a genius.
I found it.
Okay, I gotta go learn Spanish.
: I told him that I know it.
Oh.
Good luck.
Gavin, wine sales, Calabasas.
I didn't do it!
I'm lying.
I obviously did it.
Don't worry.
We just put those there for people to break.
- Really?
- No, they were very expensive.
But I own the place, so why don't we say this one broke, too?
I'm Gavin.
Let's try this one.
Tempting, but my friends are getting married.
I'm kind of on a deadline.
And also I prefer my wine sparkling, pink and under $11.
Just taste it.
Okay, one glass.
Javier, you take the early shift on Saturday.
- Ugh.
- Come on, listen, I got to do what I got to do, you know?
Uh, Gina, wait to induce until Sunday afternoon.
Gina, don't you have something on Sunday?
My husband has his fantasy baseball league.
He won't attend the birth if it doesn't happen.
That's not the man you should be with, I'm sorry.
All right, where do you want these?
Winston, where do we want these?
Where do we want?
Winston?
No, dude.
I don't know you like that, man.
Put 'em where the beer goes.
Come on, man, I got eight more deliveries.
Look, I don't like the early shift.
-  - Mercy?
Yes!
Yes, yes, man.
That's what I thought.
Cheese, the keg's gonna go where it always goes, right behind the bar.
Guys, the schedule.
- Oh, that's perfect.
Thanks.
- That works?
Back to work, everybody.
Good stuff.
Listen, I get it.
This is confusing and everything, and I can't just walk in off the street and do your job instantaneously.
But come on.
Let's be real.
It's still not harder than being a cop.
- Then prove it.
- Oh, I'll prove it.
Look, I know I told you to prove it, but I got to get back to the bar.
I just got a text from Javier that said, "fire extinguisher" question mark.
Well, all I got to say is, buckle up, Miller.
It's about to be a bumpy ride.
: Uh, where where are my sunglasses?
How the hell should I know?
I specifically asked you to keep track of my sunglasses.
And I told you I'm not your freaking mother.
Okay, you know what, calm down, I'll just squint then.
Do what you got to do, man.
Is this how all partners talk to each other?
: Welcome to hell, Miller.
I'm no good at normal life, but when I'm in the ocean and drinking wine or spending time with a beautiful stranger  that's when I, uh, truly feel like myself.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
How do you feel about a little manchego?
I feel very good about it.
We're not animals.
Or maybe we are.
Have you ever?
Hmm?
I have too much manchego.
Happens to the best of us.
Have you ever had your eyebrows combed by a woman you just met?
Yes.
Ah.
Jess, thank you.
You know, I haven't had two hours of uninterrupted sleep since a month ago when Cece made me watch An Inconvenient Truth.
Everything's under control.
The bakery's sending over - three cakes for you to try.
- Okay.
And Gavin from the winery in Calabasas gave me a great deal.
Uh, you met Gavin in Calabasas?
I didn't just meet him, we kissed a little.
No!
Ugh!
Schmidt, what happened?
What's wrong?
: You just made out with my dad.
Schmidt.
Can I just say one thing?
Hey, guys.
So, how did it go today?
Good.
We got a lot accomplished.
But, um how do I say this?
Um I made out with Schmidt's dad.
You did what?
She lulled me to sleep and then went rogue.
- You did what?
- If your files had been clearly marked, none of this would be happening.
You need better labels.
Everything is perfectly clear.
Chairs are color-coded under chartreuse, because it sounds like "chair truths".
Salmon mongers are filed under fuchsia, because I "re-fuchsia" to serve salmon at this wedding.
The groomsmen tuxes are under magenta, because "ma-gentlemen" will be wearing the dope tuxes.
Is he a good kisser?
Don't ask that, plea And don't you answer it.
It's withdrawn.
I'm just freaking out right now.
Okay, why don't we take this horrible, horrible, gross mistake into something positive?
What if this is a sign that maybe you should reach out and talk to your dad again?
Why?
Why would I talk to my dad?
He left my mom and basically missed my entire childhood.
And every time I did invite him to something, he never showed up: middle school graduation, high school graduation, when I played the titular role in a stage adaptation of Uncle Buck.
Well, he's taken up surfing now.
Oh, he's taken up surfing?
How nice.
A middle-aged man who surfs and French-kisses his customers.
What a hero.
Why did you have his number in the wedding drive at all?
Because I was maybe warming up to the idea of inviting him, but now that the nightmare called "this afternoon" has happened, I can very well see that I'm not ready.
So I'm sorry, Jess, but there will be no papa nah-nah at the wedding for you.
I'm sorry!
He was feeding me cheese, and I - I d Ugh.
- Please stop.
- Please.
So many details.
- Please.
- And-and God for if you - Just if the words "he unbuttoned my" comes out of your mouth, I'm gonna freak out!
Oh, thank God, Winston.
You're saving the city from a palm frond.
Los Angeles can sleep soundly tonight, everybody.
All right, it was a slow-ass day.
Aly, will you tell him it's a slow-ass day?
No, I'm not getting involved in this.
I'm not gonna be the yardstick in a penis measuring contest.
Did you say "yard"?
Wow, who are you dating?
Tape measure, fine.
Okay, look, this has been great, uh, but I got to get back to the bar.
7-8-6-3.
Possible 4-5-9 at 2-7-3 Elm Cross and Fairbanks.
Hell yes.
4-2-4 responding.
Over.
Bar boy, get in.
Aly, let's lock and load.
Is your gun not loaded?
You have to load your gun, Winston.
Oh, no.
Schmidt, um, that's your dad.
What?
What-what is my dad doing at our front door?
He thinks we're going on a date.
Why would he think that, Jess?
Because I said, "Let's go on a date".
I'll get rid of him.
Go to your room and close the door.
Do not tell me what to do; you are not my mom.
-  - Oh, that's disgusting.
Just go.
Go.
Wait.
Wait, wait.
I don't trust you.
Hey, Gavin!
I know what this is.
I'm not falling for it.
You don't have to stage a crime to make your job look hard.
Stay here.
Make yourself as small a target as possible.
I'll just be here napping out of boredom.
WINSTON : I see signs of forced entry.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I got movement!
I'm shaking in my boots!
Oh, yeah, right, he's ru No!
Halt!
Police!
Aah!
No!
Get away!
Get out!
Okay, I get it!
Your job is way harder than mine!
Just make the bad man go away!
- What?
- Put the gun down!
- Yeah, my job is much harder!
-  - We're gonna make him go away!
-  Can't stand to see Nick like this, you know.
At least now, he understands being a cop is much harder than being a bartender.
We all got to learn that lesson sometime.
Idiot, he doesn't think his job is harder.
He just wants you to see that he's grown and changed and whatever else stupid stuff people care about.
Oh.
Why are you looking at me like that?
No, no, I  That's why I need my damn sunglasses, man!
You shouldn't have them if you can't keep track of them, Winston.
Come on, yeah.
- No!
No!
- Hey, scoot over.
No, not in here!
Not in here, no!
No!
- You have the right to remain silent.
- No!
No!
What are you doing with a video camera on your head?
He is handsome.
-  That's a good question.
- Oh, hey, look.
That's-that's good news for you, okay.
- It's for work.
- I still hate him.
They want to make sure that we don't teach evolution.
I'm an educator, so Oh, you told me.
I believe you had me pressed up against a cask of Merlot at the time.
He's a bottom?
You want to give me the tour?
Or should we just crack this open and make out?
What a line.
Who is this clown?
- Bottle opener in here?
- Well oh.
Oh, actually, um, change of plans I can't go on a date tonight, because I have to have dinner with one of my friends' fathers, coincidentally.
No pressure.
It's just that I had a lot of fun today.
And, uh, I'd like to see you again.
- What was that?
- Oh.
Gunshots the neighborhood's in a real slide.
This is my son's name.
7 billion people.
There's got to be some overlap.
We'd better get you back to Calabasas, mister.
- Wait a minute.
- 'Cause This is my son!
Oh, my God, do you know my son?
Kind of.
- Does he live here?
- Uh Is he here right now?
I didn't know you were Schmidt's dad when we kissed.
And you didn't know I was his roommate.
And those are facts that will haunt us forever.
But I can't let you go in there.
Because he's not ready to see you.
- And for once today, I - Okay.
I want to respect his wishes.
I get it.
Um, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, I'll go.
- Wait, wait.
What?
He's in there.
Shh.
She told him.
Son?
- Babe, I think you should watch.
- I don't - Son.
- You should watch.
I know you're mad.
I get it.
Do you want me to take this off?
I didn't do a good job being your father.
You're in a zone.
I'm just gonna sit tight.
And now you're getting married.
I get it.
I wouldn't have invited me, either.
I've missed a lot.
I'm sorry.
In my defense, I was stoned for most of the '90s.
And the 2000s.
Full disclosure I was stoned this morning.
I like weed.
But the point is, if you can forgive me even a little, I'd love to have a drink with you.
And meet the man that you've become.
Come on.
Gavin.
That's okay Gavin, not Dad.
That's just where I'm at right now.
Understood.
I'm grateful you're calling me anything at all.
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
And I know that it might not seem genuine, because the only reason I came here today was to do stuff with your roommate.
But in the past ten years, I must've picked up that phone to call you and apologize a hundred times.
I really am sorry.
Gavin, this is my fiancÃ©e Cece.
She is the reason that I am the man that I am today.
It's wonderful to meet you, Cece.
I'm the terrible father.
Thank you.
Because whatever you did or didn't do, Schmidt turned out amazing.
All right.
I'm gonna head out.
I'm sure it will be a beautiful wedding.
I wasn't very good at being married.
But thankfully you seem like you're nothing like me.
For what it's worth, I like the second option.
Timeless.
I agree.
Good-bye.
Okay, wa uh  Wait, uh Here, that's for you.
Let's see if you can show up this time.
I hope that you do.
Thank you.
There's no plus one, so don't even ask.
I'll be there.
Back to square one on the seating chart.
Oh!
Sorry, I'm a little bit jumpy.
God, they should really make a TV show based off what you guys do.
You know, I've been telling that to Aly since forever!
It'd be a great idea.
Hello, Hollywood!
It's a big show!
Yeah, it's a hit.
I want to apologize.
I'm sorry that I thought my job was harder than yours.
It's not.
I'm just making schedules and buying beer.
Look, man.
The whole thing has been pretty idiotic.
You know, uh, my job is harder than yours.
Yes, that's a fact.
We all know it.
But I got to say, man, this is first time I've seen you really care about your job.
-  - You're killing it.
It means a lot to me that you said that.
- So thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.
So, look, I got I got us burgers.
- Oh!
- You know, I figured we're both too busy for steak.
-  - The tradition!
Nick, I need a drink.
It'd better be green, sweet and in a fun glass.
Schmidt, are you okay?
I mean, you look a little freaked Oh oh-oh, Cece!
Cece's pregnant!
- No.
- Ow.
Jess made out with Schmidt's dad.
Oh, my God!
So many emotions.
Got an old hound dog Bobby Joe is his name Got an old hound dog Well, I mean, did you like it?
- Don't answer that.
- Ew, it was Schmidt's dad.
You're not answering the question.
No, she's not answering the question.
Sweetie, you don't have to say anything.
I liked it a little bit.
-  - Dude.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1 Boo!
Sorry to startle you.
You didn't startle us.
Yeah, you struggled with the lock for like thirty seconds.
I got a new job!
- Babe, that's great.
- Oh, that's awesome.
Well, not really "new".
I'm starting on a trial basis tomorrow.
So where is it?
Is it at that super crunchy school?
It's the most progressive school in Los Angeles.
It's basically heaven if heaven were populated with kids that look like tiny members of Arcade Fire.
Sounds like your dream job.
I'd give you a hug, but my shirt smells pretty weird today.
Thank you.
I was actually worried.
It was getting rough out there.
Ah La-la-la-la-la-la.
God, I miss Paris.
Stop it!
Wha?
I was drinking that.
It's Jess's.
Every time she gets a job at a new school, she brings back kid germs that infect your filthy body.
Don't get me sick.
Don't get me sick either, man.
I got a date coming up, and I might get to mouth-base.
I'm not gonna get sick.
No germ can live in a body that is 65% beer.
Nick, are you eating raisins from my purse?
I confiscated those from a kid.
That explains why they're so sticky.
Sticky Nicky eats anything and I don't get sick.
Nick, you have, like, 7,500 raisins all over your room.
Why would you eat the?
I knew it.
I knew it.
That was so immediate.
And this is our nondenominational Eden.
- Wow.
- I know.
Did the kids build the chicken coup?
Yep.
Only hens, though, obviously.
Banyon Canyon has a strict "zero cocks" policy.
I like how it it encourages the chickens to stay inside but doesn't force them.
In line with our philosophy.
Who are we to tell the children what to learn and when?
Their teachers?
Williamsburg ate my seaweed, Genevieve.
No, I didn't.
Don, Williamsburg, do I have your permission to move this conflict to the Feelings Farm?
W-Wait, Jess, we sit on the floor.
Chairs are reserved for the children's feelings.
Oh.
This is much better than solving problems the Coolidge way.
There's a fight in the gym!
Oh, my God!
I got this, Jess.
CHILDREN : Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
I've been thinking about starting to wear a watch again.
Let me open the barn door and welcome Honesty.
Hi, Honesty.
Williamsburg, now, Honesty is here and has no agenda but to listen.
Honesty, I ate the seaweed.
And I'm sorry.
And, Don, do you have anything to say to Honesty?
Honesty, sorry for being so macho.
I'm sorry I picked you last for touch basket.
I'm sorry I insulted you for having a mommy and daddy.
Beautiful, Jess.
Well done.
Thank you.
Into quarantine, you.
Huge presentation at Ass-Strat tomorrow, and I cannot be sick for it.
Women I work with hate weakness.
You show up sick, you-you might as well be dead.
Uh, I'm I'm so sorry.
No, uh, it wasn't really Get out.
Guys, I'm on the mend.
Sorry, Nick.
Winston here has got that hot coffee date tomorrow, so But, to be clear, the date's hot, not the coffee.
Uh, thinking about going iced.
Don't look at my hands.
- Thanks for backing me up, boo.
- Oh, you know how boo do.
You know who's my boo?
I got a clue it's you.
Aw  So this is the most time we've ever spent alone.
Pretty interesting observation on your part.
Yeah.
What are we what are we watching?
We are having a I just started streaming it, and now it won't stop playing.
Boy, ham sandwiches.
What is it?
It's hard to say.
It's either a puppet show for kids, or it's North Korean propaganda.
Pretty weird.
I feel like we have a real connection.
Me, too.
I know it's only the first day of your trial period, but my gut is telling me you're a perfect fit.
I just like, I'm so happy here, I could cry, but the gray water bucket's too far away, and I want to save my tears to water these plants.
That's considerate.
Ooh!
My partner's here to pick me up.
I think you're gonna really like him.
Sorry I'm late.
The string came out of my prayer beads, and they just bounced all over the office.
- Oh - So frustrating.
Sam, I want you to meet Jess.
This is the candidate we were discussing in the shower.
- Yeah.
- Jess, this is Sam, my partner.
Hey, Jess.
You're a doctor for children.
Uh, it's, you know, mostly paperwork.
How do you always look so beautiful in the morning?
-  - Oh, my God.
You could have killed him.
: I'm gonna kick your ass, man.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
Have you met before?
We Yeah, we've met.
We did.
Yes, that's right, we met, we met.
- : How funny.
- Um, a bunch of times.
A lot of times.
Very many.
A lot of times.
We met a lot Yeah.
Sometimes in the day, sometimes in the, uh, nighttime.
- Oh.
- It was, you know Yeah, we, I mean Yeah.
Oh.
Bye, Jess.
Nice to see you.
The fly shirts and the even more fly shirts.
Okay, let's make this quick.
I need to work on my presentation.
It's for a chair company, and it's tentatively titled, "I Hope You're Sitting Down for This".
- 'Cause it's chairs.
- Yeah.
At which point you would laugh if you weren't so preoccupied with your date.
Okay, Winston, what are you wearing?
Well, you know, I don't want to overthink it.
It's just coffee, so So you're going to just dress like you did today, which apparently happened during a solar eclipse in a land of no mirrors.
Good note.
Strong note.
- Winston, listen to me.
- Yeah.
This is the first date since the since the Aly heartbreak.
This date is going to define the next chapter of your dating story.
Wear these magnificent sunglasses.
Put 'em on.
Oh, man.
You look like Brad Pitt on a tank.
- In that movie Furry.
- Yeah.
- You ever see Furry?
- Furry?
Nah.
It's a bunch of dudes on a tank.
They're, uh and they're outnumbered and they shoot a bunch of people.
Are they dressed in?
You should check it out.
Just look it up, Furry.
Google "Furry," nice, yeah.
Hey, don't screw up this date, it's important.
How is Genevieve dating Sam?
Is Los Angeles that small?
You guys even listening to me?
Yeah, we're listening.
What-what did Queen Ta Ta say?
Well, the ball's tonight, and Queen Ta Ta's got nothing to wear, so she's got to find a dress.
What the hell is this show?
Poppycock Palace.
It's amazing.
Winston, when did you get sick?
You were fine this morning.
Oh, yeah, I'm super sick.
Genevieve just said, "Oh".
Oh's, like, the worst.
What should I do?
- Don't do anything.
- Just do nothing.
You're just gonna make it worse.
Leave it alone, Jess.
Oh, I know.
- I could go talk to Sam.
-  I could ask him to put in a good word for me.
How long does it take to get over a breakup?
Two years?
Two years is enough, right?
- I swear to God, just leave it alone.
-  Let it lie.
Do nothing, Jess.
Four votes for leaving it alone.
That's what I'll do.
I'll just do nothing.
Hi.
I couldn't do nothing.
-  -   We must find this Tee-Tee Wah Wah  Humina humina humina humina    All these puppets do is sing about how they're friends.
I'm starting to not believe them.
-  - Shh!
This is the best part.
The Tee-Tee Wah Wah was in  It's in the damn Pee-Paw Playhouse!
- Shh.
- Spoiler alert, man.
The Pee-Paw Playhouse!
Every time.
I've been saying that for the past hour 'cause I saw you put it in there!
You know what?
I can't.
I can not.
I'm not sick.
I've been faking it.
There you go, Poppycock Palace.
You've outed me!
- You're choosing to be in here?
- Why?
'Cause I'm freaking out about the date.
Okay?
Why don't you want to go on this date?
Because I'm not over Aly.
And I know I should be moving on and this girl is okay, but she's not Aly.
: No one is Aly.
What'd she say?
Wait.
Just hold.
Oh, please don't blow your nose.
You do it so disgustingly.
Not done.
I don't need to know that bad what you said.
I'm beggin' you to stop.
Just stop.
: No one is Aly.
Okay?
You have to give other people a chance.
You deserve to be happy, Winston.
Just go on the date.
Or I could fire up another episode and we could see where they hide the Tee-Tee Wah Wah this time.
I wonder where it would be.
No, I'm-I'm gonna go on the date.
Yeah, I think I'll do that.
You guys are right.
Could you tell your future husband to let me out of this room, please?
I love that man, but he is not letting anyone out of this room.
Just being in here makes you fully contaminated.
Uh, hey, I was hoping you could put in a good word for me.
I know you're mad No, I'm not mad, Jess.
I'm just, you know, bummed that you're at my house.
Obviously, I know I messed up our relationship and you probably think I'm a bad person, - but if you could - Jess!
What are you doing here?
At my lover's house?
Oh!
Hi!
Hi.
- Um, were you - Making love?
Just finished.
He defused me like a bomb.
That sounds nice.
- Um - Did you bake Sam brownies?
No.
Chocolate's way too sexual.
This is just good, old-fashioned Kansas cornbread.
Jess No.
my gut is telling me this isn't going to work out.
Please give me a chance to make this right.
Five minutes.
Mmm : Mmm Okay, good morning.
Yes, help yourself to a bagel.
Hmm.
They're all the same, Jan.
No need to put your hands on every one of them.
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, on the seventh day, God he rested.
Yes, that's right.
God rested on the seventh day.
But the question remains: what did he rest on?
That's right.
He rested on a chair.
Oh Look underneath your butts.
You will find mankind's greatest invention.
-  - Without chairs, do you know what we have?
Squat, both position and diddly kind.
Sam, you got rid of your sofa.
Boy, that thing really gave me a rash.
Five minutes, Jess.
Okay, look.
I know it's weird to hire your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend, but I think it's another way in which we are linked.
You are the best candidate we've had in a long time.
- Thank you.
- As we all know, healing is talking.
Samuel, what do you think?
I would love to explore all of this with you, but I have a circumcision to perform.
Hopefully not your own.
Just kidding.
I know you're circumcised.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Well, not that I think about it, it just I mean, I'm definitely not picturing it right now.
I am picturing it.
Only 'cause we talked about it.
How long did you two share your journeys?
- Couple months.
- But at first it was just sex.
Mmm.
Mmm.
I used sex as a wall around my heart.
Mmm.
Uh, Jess climbed that wall many, many times.
- Mmm.
- Uh, couldn't stop climbing it.
I think I was not the only climber to climb that wall.
Until we decided to become a one-wall, one-climber mountain.
And then you invited another climber to lick your toehold.
My roommate, Nick, kissed me.
I'm so sorry, Sam.
I exist only in the present.
All of that's behind me.
What what about this Nick?
Is he sorry?
I think Nick's kind of still upset that Sam punched him in the throat.
What?
Sam so tender and delicate You haven't met Nick.
He's just the most throat-punchable boy in all the world.
I don't care.
I don't even Nick is a whatever, I don't even have to Sam, do you need this Nick to apologize for wounding you?
I do.
So, Nick I'm wondering if you could come in the other room with me and just, like, real quick, apologize to Sam for kissing me?
No.
Jess, I told you to leave it alone.
I didn't, though.
I made it worse.
Now the only way I'm gonna get that job is if Nick apologizes to Sam.
Jess, he hit me.
He's gonna hit me again.
He's not gonna hit you.
Please, it's my dream job.
I'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.
I know it hurt a whole lot.
Not that much, but you did it, so Okay.
And I feel like you should apologize to me for kissing my girlfriend.
Yes, uh, right.
Cool.
Well, that went so well.
I-I don't really feel like that was a genuine apology, and-and I'd really like one.
- Yeah.
- I mean did you feel like it was genuine?
Actually, he didn't even apologize.
Cool beard, Sam.
What'd you just say about my beard, bro?
"Bro"?
Yeah, I just said "cool beard".
I think your beard looks really cool.
Talk about my beard one more time, bro.
Sam, "bro" is a beach term.
- The beard is very fun.
- Say "beard".
You want me to say the word that starts with a "B," - ends with a "D"?
- Yeah.
Say "beard" one more time, bro.
Say the word "beard," bro!
: Beard.
-  - Oh!
Oh!
Nick, are you dying?
'Cause it looks like you're dying!
Not dying.
- Who are you?
- I don't know what it is.
I just can't help it with this guy.
Why didn't you just hit me in the nads like a normal person, Sam?
Well, I'm leaving.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Don't, don't go!
Nobody goes.
Jim Morrison.
That's who you look like.
We are solving this conflict in the mother-loving Feelings Farm.
Those sunglasses are amazing.
Well, they're made even more amazing by your reflection in them.
Wait, how are you seeing my reflection in them?
You got me.
I'm not.
I'm just running game.
Are you this smooth-talking in regular glasses?
No, I'm not that smooth-talking, no.
I'm not.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Honesty, I stole coffee from a bagel restaurant.
Um, I didn't know how the line worked.
Okay, now I've talked.
Uh, who wants to go next Sam?
Sure, uh, Honesty, I honestly want Nick to apologize for kissing Jess.
I did apologize, Sam.
Real, real quick you have to address Honesty directly.
You want me to talk to a chair?
: I don't want to.
Hey, you like soup?
Right?
You like soup, right?
Of course I like soup.
All right, well, address the chair and I'll make you some soup.
No strings attached.
Well, except for the string of the chair.
All right.
Honesty, I'm, uh, sorry I ki You know what?
I'm not.
I'm not sorry that I kissed your girlfriend.
'Cause, first of all, she wanted me to!
And it was fun.
It felt great.
And then we dated for a long time and that was fun.
You were out of the picture, not even in her thoughts.
It was a whole new thing.
We just, we fell in love with each other, like crazy love like, a lot of good memories, a lot of passion.
- A lot of good sex.
- Nick.
We once tried to sneak into the Kids' Choice Awards, and we got in and watched a bunch of kids get awards.
So, yeah.
- Nick.
- Topped - Okay.
- I have a fever of 103 and I'm talking to a chair and I'm not a great talk O-Okay.
Cool, cool.
Well, I think everything's good then.
Sam, I can feel you holding back.
If you can't be honest now in this strange place to that hideous chair, how can I trust you with my mind, my breasts and my precious yoni.
Sounds like it's full of yarn.
Okay, fine.
Honesty, all right, I had a really hard time opening up to someone and then I met Jess and and I thought we were We were great together.
And then Nick kissed her, and I-I went down kind of a weird path.
I gained 85 pounds.
And then I lost, like, 100.
I had no idea.
Poured almost all my money into silkworms.
They froze to death.
Now I'm doing yoga, meditation, and I'm a vegan and I don't know.
What the hell have I become?
Look at these shoes, huh?
Look at these ridiculous shoes!
I like those shoes.
They're made from recycled shoes.
They are so dumb!
I don't know who I am!
I want to go back to who I was!
There he is.
The real Sam.
Wow!
What a breakthrough!
Sam.
It is an honor to meet you.
I'm Genevieve.
And I am also dumping you.
Okay, that's great.
That's perfect, yeah.
As usual, I have had a terrible time in your horrible loft with all of you idiot people.
Sam, wait!
If you take your bike, will you relock mine?
Thank you.
Oh, Genevieve, I am so sorry.
Don't be, don't be.
I wanted a resolution and I got one.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to call my childhood phone number and scream at whoever picks up.
I'll see you Monday.
Wait, I got the job?
Of course you did.
This was one of the most profound Feelings Farm I have ever been a part of.
Radical, Jess, radical.
Uh, yeah, I have questions about where to park and stuff, but you know, I'll just, uh, I'll text you!
- Ha!
-  What if the big letter comes back?
I can't believe it just took a high fever for me to like this show.
Not if it's silent!
Well, I hate it.
Why is the Crispy Castle bigger than Mount Tummy Tum?
It's dang gibberish.
How was your presentation?
Well, thank you for asking.
It was a disaster.
We can expect robust grow  Are you holding in a sneeze?
: Mm-mm.
God, where did it even go?
Son of a bitch.
How did I get sick?
I was so careful.
You did the best you could.
I have no idea, man.
- We're missing Poppycock.
- You guys, I hate that Sam's out there mad at me.
Because he's mad at you or because you still have feelings for him?
Because he's mad at me.
If I could just  Leave it alone.
Leave it alone, Jess.
Right.
You're right.
Wow, you shaved.
I mean, not "wow" like I like it.
I mean I don't not like it.
What are you doing here?
I, I don't want your cornbread.
It's not cornbread.
It's, uh, it's brownies.
Um Hey, I'm sorry we broke up.
And I think for me it was just weird timing.
But I agree with you.
We were great together.
Really great.
Get out of my life.
Big shift in tone there.
Eh, Nick'll eat 'em.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1 Ugh!
Son of a bitch.
Nothing.
I'm trying to get in touch with Sam you know, to clear the air Get out of my life.
Why isn't he responding?
I'm just gonna go out on a crazy limb here maybe it's because you got his girlfriend to dump him?
I'm not being weird about it.
I just texted him three times.
-  - And I called him.
He wasn't there.
I left him a sensible voice mail.
To lighten the mood, I told a little story about how the first-graders' pet rabbit got stuck in the lawn mower and I had to I had to collect it.
That's a terrible story.
Colonel FlapEars?
- Wow.
- Unbelievable.
I had to park two blocks away, like an animal.
The new bar, Presh, is doing valet and they took all of our spots.
I've been saying for months that we need valet.
Is there anything sexier than tossing your keys in the general direction of someone you care nothing about?
"Keep it running".
Hi.
I'm looking for Jessica Day.
Oh, right here.
You've just been served.
- What?
!
- What?
A restraining order?
!
From Sam.
Oof I'm not a restraining order person.
A restraining order.
That's worse than herpes.
When I find Sam  I'm gonna kill him.
You can't find Sam.
'Cause you have a restraining order.
Winston.
You have to help me with this.
Sam is the only one who can drop this charge.
But the magic of a restraining order is that you can't talk to him.
And that that is human drama.
Wow.
Tasteful, hip I mean, nothing matches, yet nothing is random.
That's just a framed toupee on the wall and it friggin' works.
What are these bartenders wearing?
They look like Civil War surgeons.
This is a very professional establishment.
Let me do the talking.
You don't think I talk professional good?
You don't think I professional talk good?
What am I saying weird there?
- You speak poorly, professionally.
- Okay.
Hey, hey.
I'm Connie, the owner.
You're the nutmeg wholesaler?
Me?
No, I'm not the nutmeg wholesaler.
You have a nutmeg wholesaler vibe.
That's what it is.
I've been trying to figure it out for years.
You totally look like a nutmeg wholesaler.
- Me no nutmeg -  How can I help you?
Connie, hello.
Very nice to meet you.
We are both local entrepreneurs, as you are.
Uh, we co-own the bar up the street, and there is a business situation that we would like - to bring to your attention - Yeah, your stupid valet is taking all the spots in front of our bar, and it's time for it to come to an end.
It's not sittin' well with us folks over at the Griffin.
What's a griffin?
What is wait, what is the Griffin?
The Griffin is the name of the bar that we own together, you buffoon.
- You don't know the name of our bar?
- Why don't we We don't have a sign.
We should have a sign.
Is this the time for this?
I feel like this is a conversation I don't need to be a part of.
My valet is totally legal.
But thanks for stopping by.
Maybe, you know, maybe I'll stop by your bar.
I'll just, like, knock on doors until until I find you.
Uh, please don't leave.
Pl Okay, leave.
We'll d-discuss this I don't like this woman.
Hey, uh, where should I put this, uh, nutmeg?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
The lady's name is Connie.
She's o-over that way.
I'm here to overturn a restraining order.
I brought lots of excellent character references.
In the words of Ms. Cheryl Riggins of Portland, Oregon: "When the school sewage line broke, "Jessica was the only student who rolled up her sleeves, "grabbed a pail and went to work.
"She should be tested for hepatitis immediately.
Immediately".
That's not the one Uh, sorry about that, Riggs.
Uh, Jessica, you better be here because you wrote a song you wanted me to listen to.
I just don't get why Sam would do this.
- I'm not dangerous.
- Hey.
Friend face.
That was cute.
Cop face.
Girl, sit yo' ass down.
And use the word "allegedly" when discussing Sam.
I do not need Internal Affairs crawling all up in my holes.
What if I typed up a note and left it on his car?
Oh, you stop it, Jess.
Yeah, but I Let it lie.
Okay.
No letters.
This would've been a better plan if I knew what he drives.
A lot of black cars.
Cars should have people's names on them.
Ugh, it's so stupid.
Well, have a good one.
- See you later.
- See you tomorrow.
No.
No.
Sam drives a truck?
Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez.
Well, this is not my fault.
Hey, Jess, I'm at work.
Is this a cop situation or a friend situation?
Both.
What would you say if I told you I was in the bed of Sam's pickup?
Allegedly.
I said "allegedly".
Okay, good.
So you're not in the back of a truck.
No, I am.
I'm-I'm, I am "allegedly" in-in Sam's truck.
Jess, you seem to be confused.
Here's how it works.
Um, allegedly, Ferguson and I are eating pasta in a hot air balloon.
Realistically Winston, I'm in the back of Sam's truck right now.
I wanted Sam to know that I'm not crazy.
Wait, shh, he's changing his music.
Can't keep my hands to myself Selena Gomez, interesting.
Ugh.
Jess, what is happening right now?
Connie, with her fancy cocktails.
I can make a fancy cocktail.
Sure you can.
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?
What the hell is all this stuff?
We need to make some some real improvements around here, if we're gonna compete with Presh.
Improvements?
!
Just minor tweaks, okay?
Like a jukebox that doesn't catch fire sometimes.
Separate olive and cherry trays.
A toilet that flushes down and not up.
Okay, that's an attraction and a lot of our customers actually like that.
Why are you so eager to change our bar?
We should be ruining their bar.
We should cut their power.
We should paint a door where there isn't a door.
We're not talented enough to paint a realistic door, Nick.
All right, okay.
Try this.
I call it "Whiskey Business," but surprise!
There's vodka in that.
Boom.
Thank you, honey.
Come on.
It's a little chunky.
Tastes like loose chili, a little bit.
Yeah, I'm gonna go get some fresher ingredients.
Okay, you do that, hon.
Can we please stop competing with these fad bars?
I hate fads, man.
Nick, just a small little piece of important, friendly advice: you need to give your Ds more emphasis.
- Fads.
- What I said.
- You're gonna get yourself in trouble.
- By hating fads?
That's maybe just change it to "trendy" bars.
Or "hip" bars.
We need to stop competing with trendy, hip fad bars?
-  - Okay.
All right.
I need a drink.
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
Somebody cut our soda.
Oh, my God, who would do such a thing?
It's Connie, Schmidt.
Well, how would she have gotten in here?
I mean, she couldn't She took our bubbles, Schmidt!
We have to retaliate.
What do we look like, Tonya Harding's henchmen?
Who am I, Jeff Gillooly?
Either you care enough about this bar to fight for it, or you don't.
Because I care enough.
I'll fight.
Let's do this.
What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna hit her where it hurts.
- I'm in.
Not the vagina.
We're gonna go after the bar.
Uh, yes, that's ri N There was not even a single part of me that thought you were talking about the vagina.
- The bar.
- The b Yes, the All right, I'm gonna take over the plan.
Good.
Yeah, good.
It was getting on top of me.
: Winston, sorry.
Sorry, I hit some potholes, and then we got on the freeway, and then some schoolkids started throwing pencils at me, -  - then we passed a cop, and I had to pretend to be a mannequin.
- What is that noise?
- Hang on a second, Winston.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Where are you?
What is that?
Aah!
-  Winston, can you hear me?
- Jess, I can't hear you!
- Winston?
!
- I can't Are you okay?
What is happening right now?
The bed's getting cold, and you're not here  Hello, Jess?
The future that we hold is so unclear -  can hear me, listen to me now - Ow, ow, ow.
Shining like stars and screaming  Winston!
Winston, help!
But then you disappear and make me wait I need all units!
Send all units!
-  -   Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow Ow, ow, ow.
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape  So this is how I die!
The future that we hold is so unclear  But I'm not alive -  - Reasons why  - I'm not crazy!
-  Save your advice  That was great.
Just like I envisioned it.
Connie cut our soda line.
So we take a fish, and we put it in the vents of her restaurant bar.
The whole place is gonna smell like a whale's ass.
Not just any fish either.
- A branzino.
You know - Freaking branzino.
She thinks she's hip and classy.
Wait till she tangles with the most highly regarded table fish in all the world.
I was trying to cut a runaway olive, and I cut the soda line.
-  - Why?
Why'd you?
I-I didn't think you'd actually notice, to be honest with you.
- What are we going to do now?
- Deny, deny, deny.
There's no way she'll know it's us.
Oh, hey, guys.
I just came by to return your fish.
I've never seen that fish before in my life.
Ooh, is that a branzino?
Whoever bought that fish has impeccable taste.
I mean, I guess they kind of look like - Nah, that doesn't even No, that's - Really?
Yeah, good luck finding those guys.
- Of course it's us, you idiot.
- Why'd you admit it?
!
We're right there!
We might as well be wearing name tags!
- You're so stupid, man.
- You're so stupid, moron.
You're a bad guy to partner up in this stuff.
Give us a chance to, first, apologize and, second, give you a little bit of context here.
You see,  we thought that you attacked our bar.
Why would I attack a bar that has no one in it?
And if I did want to attack you, I would just report you for one of your numerous health code violations.
Some improvements definitely need to be made.
We we found a dead fox in the keg room the other week.
We're not sure it was a fox.
Uh, it was an animal that had died in our keg room that was bigger than a cat but smaller than a big dog A word of advice: do not mess with me.
This past year has been the worst year of my life.
First, my cat died.
Then my husband left me for our neighbor, and so I had to listen to them having sex through our bedroom wall every single night.
And then he left my neighbor for my mother, which is, like, a very long story that I don't really want to get into.
Then my other cat died.
Then I ran over a dog while I was driving to the vet with our dead cat on my lap.
You guys messed with my business now I'm gonna have to destroy you.
If I may ask how and when you're planning on destroying us.
Any information would be would be greatly appreciated.
Yeah, 'cause then we could prepare for it a little bit.
It's gonna be soon.
And when you least expect it.
That's something.
Thank You followed me into a car wash!
That is so not Okay, I have a What I want to say to you I have a lot of things I want to say to you.
I have a restraining order against you.
I'm not dangerous, and you don't need to be afraid of me.
Clearly.
Okay,  well, I guess, um nice seeing you.
I'm gonna get to my next engagement.
Where are we, by the way?
I'll just check my little my little thing.
It's actually not functioning.
Old gal got a little bit wet.
Eh, feed it to the birds.
Oh!
Oh That got me.
Yeah, that got me.
: Oh, I'm just gonna rest for a second.
Get in the car.
Damn it.
Yeah, I get it.
It's too sad to watch.
Clear.
Clear.
There are no signs of foul play back here.
Also, I feel fantastic.
That's because you're very drunk, Cece.
You're supposed to be spitting them out.
How would she poison our booze anyway?
We've been here the entire time.
Who knows?
You saw how intense she was.
We're at a state of high alert.
And, frankly, I don't trust your coat.
It's too warm to wear a coat like that.
Unless you're hiding a fish.
You hiding a fish?
All I got's a chicken.
Okay, don't trust you.
Out you go.
Thanks for coming in again, Eric.
This bar is outrageous.
I'm so sorry it's not like your favorite bar, Presh.
You know my favorite bar is Heshe's Tango in Phuket.
Their coconut mojitos literally gave me an orgasm.
I had to buy new pants.
: "I love Presh.
Presh has napkins and walnuts".
Is that meant to be me?
No, I'm doing a spot-on Winston.
Because I do not talk like that.
- Do you even like the Griffin?
- What is the Gri?
Are you kidding me?
It's uh, the Griffin's our bar.
- I knew that.
- He loves it!
What the hell are you talking about, you booze hound?
We lost her a long time ago.
- Cece, honey, drink some water, okay?
- Nope.
Hey, man, do you know how hard I have worked at this bar in the past year?
I've killed myself for this place.
A year ago, we were in a sinkhole.
We were in the red.
But now, because of me, because of my work, - we're in the white.
- What's "the white"?
The white.
Breaking even.
- Oh, we're breaking even?
- Yes, that's what I'm saying.
How wonderful.
And let's just stop there.
Where will we invest our extra zero percent?
I know, how about in the toilet?
The same toilet that flushes upwards.
Wait!
What if this this was Connie's plan the entire time?
Okay, she knew we would be so paranoid that we would drive all the customers out of the bar and start fighting with each other.
Connie emptied this entire bar without lifting a finger.
Nick, you may not like her, but you must admit she is brilliant.
I don't have to admit that.
But I will say you've made something crystal clear.
I'm alone.
- I'm all alone.
- Oh, here we go.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna handle this myself, all alone.
I'm gonna call a meeting of the families Oh, Lord.
a sit-down with all the businesses on the block, and you are not invited.
- Okay, fine.
- Shh.
Just take the rejection.
Hi.
Oh, you guys open?
Yeah, yeah, we are.
What can I get you to drink?
Ah, no, nothing.
I'm just here to see the "up" toilet.
Yeah, you are.
Look, I just want you to know, when you drop me off, that's it I'm not bothering you ever again.
Good.
I just want to say one thing - Please stop talking.
-  - Oh!
Geez!
-   Aah!
Get out.
I'm calling you a car out!
Sam, you were right to take a restraining order against me because, ever since I saw you again, I can't stop thinking about you.
I'm not the girl you used to know.
I'm really together now.
I know I just went through a car wash, but I'm still very mad at you.
As you should be.
You taste like soap.
I feel like I'm on Grey's Anatomy in these scrubs.
- I don't know what that means.
- Oh.
300 feet away from each other now!
No!
We figured it out.
Jessica Day, take your hands off of this man.
Dr. Sam, friend face: good to see you.
Cop face: 300 feet away from her.
When did you become a cop, dude?
- Oh, not too long ago.
- Congrats.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
It's nothing, you know.
I get to do a lot of cool stuff on the job.
I once slid across the hood of a car.
I scratched it all up.
I didn't have to pay for it, you know.
'Cause I'm a cop, so  300 feet away.
I've gathered the families here today, to end this terrible, terrible, unnecessary war.
So, thank you.
Connie and I have had our battles, but today we make our peace.
She's of the north.
She's the owner of Presh.
What is this?
I only came because you said you were suing me for what I did, which, by the way, was nothing.
I lied to ensure your presence.
Good Lord.
Over here, we have Peter Verrebian.
: Yes.
Enjoying the pasta.
He is also the owner of Produce-slash- Cold Beer-slash-Ice.
Peter, I know that's what the sign above your market says.
Is that the name of your establishment?
- Yes.
- Very creative.
Oh, and AnaLysa from AnaLysa's Nails wanted to be here, but she couldn't find somebody to cover her register.
And if you've ever gone in that place, it's messy.
Like, it's not a great establishment.
How did things get this far, everybody?
This is so weird.
Thank you for the spaghetti.
Wasn't that a nice thing to say?
I wish we were all so polite.
I'd like to say something.
I don't need you here, Schmidt.
Connie you know, Presh may have booths made of reclaimed wood and carefully curated artisanal flatware but this bar will have something that your fancy place will never have.
What's that?
Nick Miller.
Oh.
Well.
No, we'll never have that.
Of course I'm proud that this bar breaks even, but I think that you can do better than that.
I didn't just invest in this bar, Nick.
I invested in you.
No, you didn't.
You don't have equity in me, and we're I get it.
Hey, Connie yours isn't the only bar on the block that has valet, starting immediately.
We have valet, kiddo.
You got valet.
: You got valet.
This is beautiful.
The valet's yours.
The valet's yours.
Um are they in love?
Yes.
Very much so.
Okay.
Hey, guys, um let's just call a truce and end this.
If nothing else, so I can stop dealing with you.
- I'll drink to that.
- You got it.
CONNIE : Okay.
- A toast?
- To us.
Salud!
Okay.
This is good.
This is really good.
Uh, yeah.
My buddy Andy makes it in his basement.
I'm not allowed to say anything else about it, though.
Wow, I'm not kidding.
I think this is the best whiskey that I've ever had.
You want to go out with me sometime?
What?
No.
No.
No, no, no.
Never.
- Never.
-  But the whole back and forth with, like, the fish and getting mad at each other Never.
Never.
When you came back and threw the fish down?
Nothing?
Where did you get there, from "I like this whiskey" to?
- What the hell was that?
- You know what?
Let it go.
Let it go.
This was, this is my mistake.
It was a misread I would sooner make love to Peter and his mouthful of spaghetti.
: Pass.
Okay, Peter.
Cheers.
298, 299 Watch out for the lamp.
And that's 300, right there.
Wait here.
I'm dropping the restraining order.
This isn't necessary.
I'll determine what's necessary; I'm a cop.
Stop!
There's no more restraining order.
And no more cop face.
Girl, this is my friend face.
Honestly, I can't tell the difference.
Well, there is no difference.
That's why I have to announce it.
And as your friend, Winston, I just want to make sure that you two have thought things through.
That you're not rushing into things, you know?
You don't hurt each other again.
I'm thinking, maybe, as your friend, maybe you should be restraining yourselves.
Because of the restraining order?
Look, we've grown up a lot.
We've made mistakes and we've learned from them.
Jess, nobody takes out a restraining order unless they think that they're in danger.
Winston's right.
What?
You're dangerous.
I mean, you're dangerous to me.
You want to know why I got the restraining order?
'Cause I couldn't stop thinking about you either.
I didn't trust myself not to call you and start this whole thing up again.
You know, you-you've changed, Jess, and that's great, I just I haven't.
And I'm still mad at you and that's gonna take some time.
I think the, uh, best, smartest thing for us to do is to just  say good-bye.
What does Selena Gomez always say?
"Take your things and go" The lyric is, "Take away your things and go".
"Take your things away and go "Take away your things and go" "Take away your things and go".
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Good-bye, Jess.
Good-bye, Sam.
That's enough.
Wow.
Powerful stuff.
But I think we both know that it was for the best.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been dealing with this all day and I got some chores to get done.
Cat box to clean, juice to popsicle-ize Sam!
Sam, wait!
Wait!
Sam!
Sam!
Hi.
Look, I want to say I lied.
I said that I've grown up; I don't know that I have.
I just said that 'cause it sounded good.
Get in.
And now I see that you're Oh, are we crazy?
Yes!
Now I see - Oh.
Ow!
Sorry.
- Ow.
Yeah, yeah.
- No.
Sorry.
No.
Sorry.
- Let me get this through the steering wheel here.
Kiss my neck while I get the steering wheel.
-  - Over there.
- Aah!
-   Hello!
Quite a bit of traffic - building up back there.
-  Beep-beep!
Come on!
- They can wait.
-  - MAN 2: Hurry up!
Let's go!
-  Get a room!
Actually, I I really feel bad for them.
They're all they have to get somewhere, too.
They're getting a bit angry.
Yeah, okay.
Let's go to your place.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
1 How do you spell "boudoir"?
I'm so far off, I'm not getting the auto-correct.
So which girl are you texting now, the coffin-maker?
Oh, you're thinking about Jamie.
Nah, nah.
She kinda disappeared into her busy season, so this is Rhonda.
Oh, is this the girl with the yogurt mouth?
That's Simi Valley Sue.
Rhonda is Willem Dafoe's assistant.
No, she's n Rhonda's the army reservist.
Boy, you are on such a tear with the ladies, Winston.
Your boy cleanin' up.
Not thinking about Aly.
And Rhonda, you know, she's cool, man.
I'm having the most fun with her.
She really keeps me on my toes.
And y'all know Winston love being on his toes.
- Definitely, definitely.
- You know, actually, she's poppin' by later.
You guys will get to meet her before the wedding.
Before the she's coming to our wedding?
Yes.
Winston, you're gonna bring this flavor of the month to our wedding?
- Well, I was - She's gonna be in wedding photos?
Are you kidding me?
Oh, gather round, grandchildren.
Look at Uncle Winston, and this woman who is not Willem Dafoe's assistant.
Well, I am excited to meet her.
Can you tell us some basics?
Her-her last name, her rank Yeah, I don't know any of that stuff.
I've only been on two dates with her, so Two dates, how do we even know that she's fighting for our army?
Hey!
Are we looking at the owner of a new used car?
No.
I wish.
Billy from Car County started playing misogynist bingo with me as soon as I walked in the door.
He called me "dollface".
Started pointing out all the room in the trunk for my shopping bags.
Then, he explained four-wheel drive to me.
I don't need four-wheel drive explained.
It's very well named.
Like World Series of Poker champion, Chris Moneymaker.
Continue, though.
Okay, you know how you get back at this guy?
Huh.
You do the entire thing online.
You set up an e-mail address, but under a dude's name.
Yes.
I love it.
Help!
Help!
There's some lunatic after me!
- Oh, my God!
- Call 911!
Call 911!
Please, somebody help me.
-  - Winston!
Winston, go!
Oh, my God!
Stay there!
Wait!
Don't pull it out.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You just got Rhonda'd.
Rhonda'd!
What's your last name?
I'm almost done with my "Jeff Day" e-mail to the dealer.
I've constructed a very rich back story for him.
- Listen to this, listen to this.
- Okay.
He wrote this while on break from his job, which is hanging telephone line.
He should have a desk job by now, but the ground has always been trouble for him.
Yeah, the poles are safer.
And sometimes, at dusk, he can see his buddies from Desert Storm dancing in the static.
- That's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's okay.
So you need a dude pass before you send it off, right?
No, I don't need a dude pass.
No, no.
Listen to this.
My wife is on my nuts.
I need two grand off the MSRP.
Go, Clips.
- Go, Clips!
Good, yeah.
- Hey, Nick, if anyone's gonna give Jess a dude pass, it's gonna be me.
A dude pass.
Not a pretty-boy pass.
Not a "I make my money from my mind" pass.
Not a "I look like the cute benchwarmer on an NBA team, "but I'm not good enough to play".
- Are you done?
- After I take my dude pass, why don't you take a short guy pass?
Why don't you take a snake voice pass?
Is it frustrating for you when you go to concerts and you can't see the stage 'cause you're so short?
It can be.
It can be!
I know we're in an awkward situation.
I used to date Nick, now I'm dating Sam, again.
I thought we were over all this.
And now every time I turn around, you guys are in some kind of turf war.
Are we in a turf war?
I didn't even notice, you punk.
This can't go on forever.
Let's just get our emotions out there.
Let's just express ourselves I'm good.
I don't - I got nothing.
- Yeah, I mean, everything's fine.
- You feel good?
- Yeah, I feel great.
You feel good, I feel good.
- Yeah, I got nothing to talk about, yeah.
- We're good, man.
I don't feel nothin' towards you man.
You can spit on the bottom of my shoe, dude.
Let's  This is what you want for our nuptials?
Shenanigans?
This is our wedding, Cece, not "Ernest Goes to Our Wedding".
Can't we just revoke Winston's plus one?
Okay, look, I'm sure there's more to Rhonda than just pranks, all right?
We owe it to Winston to get to know her.
Well, let's start at the beginning.
Tell us about your childhood.
Where'd you grow up?
- Well, I grew up in Baltimore.
- Oh.
I don't like to talk about it around new people, but we were homeless.
Oh, I'm I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
It was tough.
We didn't have money for food, clothes, toys.
My brother and I adopted a rat.
I remember, we called the rat Singular Wireless.
He was sweet.
Until he ate my brother's pinkie toe clean off.
: What?
He bit it like a baby carrot.
Just .
It woke me up.
That snap, that snap.
In the end, we laughed about it, 'cause what else can you do?
Just Singular being Singular.
Gosh darn it.
He ran away after a while my brother, not the rat he didn't get far, obviously, not with nine toes.
Listen, it wasn't a great childhood, and I know that I come on strong, but I guess, if I can scare people with my pranks, then I know I'm not the only one who's scared.
What a cruel, terrible world we live in.
I had no idea.
I'm so, so, so, sorry.
You're stupid, Schmidt.
And you're-you're stupid, too, Cece, Stupid.
Okay, wait, so the en the en the entire story is a lie?
Rhon.
Da'd.
Pow-pow.
Need a little more of this.
Anybody else want some, uh, wine?
Oh, no, thanks.
I salted it.
You salted the wine?
How is that even a prank?
You just told her that you salted it before she took a sip.
Unless of course that the prank is that there's no salt in it.
Yes, there's salt.
There's most definitely salt in that.
This is delightful.
Mr. Day, I, too, love Sons of Anarchy.
You drive a pretty hard bargain.
I agree to your terms!
You just have to sign the papers in person.
I'm at the dealership for another hour.
Ah, I did not think this through.
Nick I have hit a snag in my car buying.
I'm not surprised you came to me.
I heard you and, uh, Dr. Trap-Jaw last night, and he climaxes like a woman.
That was me.
Then you sound like a woman when you climax.
- I am a woman.
- What's your point?
We're still on your point.
I'm waiting for you to wrap it up.
My point is your car deal went south, and so you need Nick Miller to twist some nips for you, yeah?
Nope.
The nips have already been twisted.
All I need right now is someone to pretend to be Jeff Day.
And I would ask Sam, but he's in a procedure all day.
He's de-webbing some kid's toes.
It sounds whimsical, but it's actually very serious.
Why would you go to him?
He cannot close this deal for you, Jess.
The deal has already been closed.
Right now, I just need, literally, any man.
-  - If I could wish a mannequin to life, I would.
Oh, Jessica.
You understand that fate fused that kid's toes together.
And Dr. Sam is the man for that job, but I'm the man for this job.
So if you excuse me, let me get my Julius Pepperwood disguise.
Wait, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
I just need you to pretend to be Jeff Day.
- Well, I need some sort of disguise.
- Absolutely not.
- What about a mustache?
- That's a disguise.
- Not if I grow one.
- We're in the car in ten minutes.
You gonna grow a mustache in ten minutes?
No man could do that.
Scientifically impossible.
Hey, I guess science always wins, right?
See ya in the car.
All right, now remember, Jeff Day is a lovable schnook, who makes sausage in his spare time.
You work for the phone company, so you call the phones "units".
All right, what's my back story?
Units, that's good.
Uh, you're my wife.
You spend all day making sausages, and clucking with the other hens on the kitchen unit.
No, no.
I'm a disgraced ice-skating sensation.
I got ex-communicated from the sport for protesting that nudie fabric.
And then I broke my butt.
Right, and which toe is webbed?
Ugh, Nick, that's real life.
Ugh.
This is gonna be a disaster.
Abort, abort.
Dollface!
You're back!
Hi.
I am, I am.
Um, I believe you've been e-mailing with my husband Jeff.
Jeff Day.
Lover of meats, enemy of nonsense.
Put her there.
- Nice mustache.
- My guy.
All right.
Oh, excuse me for a minute.
I have to go feed the meter.
Uh, excu before you go, can you please fill us in on all active pranks at this table?
I think you found them all, okay?
Relax.
Oh, wait!
Winston I put a watch battery in your huevos rancheros.
In the huevos?
No, you did not.
Winston, she's been sitting down this whole time.
Does she have someone working with her in the kitchen?
Can you explain to me how that's funny?
'Cause you could have cracked a molar or choked to death.
It's hilarious.
'Cause what if I choke on the battery?
You know what I mean?
Or if the battery breaks open inside of me, you know?
and causes all kinds of no?
What-what?
You guys don't like her?
- Mm - Uh And I mean, look, I get it.
She might not be the one, but come on, at least we're having fun, right?
We gave her a chance, okay, Winston?
But I am scared to touch my food, and I don't want to feel that way at our wedding.
- Yes.
- Winston, it brings me no joy to do this, whatsoever, but I'm revoking your plus one.
You gave me that plus one, which means I can bring anyone.
Plus one means plus anyone.
For the Schmidt-Parikh wedding, it's a plus the one.
You just had that one locked and loaded, didn't you?
- Excuse me, sir?
Here's your check.
- Oh, my God!
That's my face.
Why is that my face?
Ha-ha!
-  -  No, no, no, no.
Save it.
It's gonna be wasted on these two.
Let's get out of here.
How did she get a mask of my face?
Oh  did they just stick us with the bill?
N no.
She left, like, $300.
Who does this prank?
Thanks for meeting with us.
I don't know what made me think I could have possibly bought a car by myself.
You were right to get your hubby involved.
Now, Mr. Day, your mind seemed pretty made up over e-mail.
Look, Billy, I wish, uh, we could get twin hogs, but then the missus would stop giving me that sweet potato pie.
You know Jeff Day, I need my sweet potato pie every four hours.
Ain't that right, baby?
I married a hungry man.
If you're open to other options, we just got a consignment of vehicles that we are looking to move at rock bottom prices.
I had my heart set on that cute little car that you showed me in that e-mail you wrote.
Had a really big makeup mirror, and I sure was excited about it.
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, buh-buh There's no harm in hearing what the catch of the day is, right?
- No harm.
- Exactly.
Billy, Jeff needs to take his omega-3 pill.
- Could you grab us a glass of water?
- Not a problem.
I got a bad ticker myself.
Not uh I had him right where I wanted him.
He's trying to bait and switch us, and you're gobbling it up like an old king with a turkey leg.
You're leaving money on the table.
I can smell it.
Watch.
I'm gonna string him along, and then I'm going to get you a better deal.
He thinks he's fishing for me.
Nah, I'm fishing for him, but from the water.
You're in way over your head.
Right where a fish wants to be.
Here's your water, and take as many mouse pads as you want.
- Quit stalling me.
- Smart.
Tell me about the secret stash, Billy.
These vehicles are a lot bigger than what you were e-mailing about.
Well, a car can never be too big, and a pot can never be too sweet.
I hear ya, so I guess, don't waste your time with anything smaller - than a two liter?
- Two liter?
I want a car, not a Mountain Dew.
You want to send this girl out on to the road with a little bulk, in case she gets hit, or more likely, hits someone, am I right?
- While she's text messaging.
- They can't stop.
They're beautiful, but  : I like you.
Honey, don't forget how much research you put in.
You don't want to throw that all away, like I did with my skating career.
Jeff, you clearly know your way around an engine.
What are we talkin', 5.0?
You want the bird to sing in my underpants, I'm gonna need double digits.
- Oh, yeah, - Jeff.
baby!
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
- It's gonna sing.
- Boom.
-  - You get me.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
It's Oksana Baiul.
Honey, get the car I want, or the only pie you'll be eating is out of the garbage.
Hey, I thought you were de-webbing.
Well, it took less time than I thought.
Yeah, he only wanted his big toe free, so he could wear flip-flops.
- How's the new car?
- Ugh!
Don't make a thing out of it, but I had to ask Nick to be Jeff Day.
You asked Nick for help, not me?
Well, you were in surgery, and he was the only person I could find, but he's screwing it up so much that I really wish I'd "Reverse-Tootsie'd".
Of course he's screwing up.
He's a little human porkchop.
- I'm on my way.
- Wait, don't come.
Don't come.
I could be Jeff Day.
I just need to find a fake mustache.
What is it with you guys and mustaches?
Look, I have the situation un-under control.
Cutting Winston's plus one creates a real ripple effect.
Jason gets bumped from 14.
Ruthie gets bumped from 6, landing Tyler right next to the bar, which feels like tempting fate.
Yeah, you know what?
The more I think about it, we may have judged Rhonda a little too harshly.
Maybe you're right.
You know what?
If Winston is happy, with Lady Kutcher, we should support him.
What's the worst that can happen?
Maybe she'll put some cellophane over the toilet bowls.
Hopefully, my Uncle Randy doesn't get -  - fired up at the buffet.
Hey, guys.
We were just talking, and we're sorry about earlier.
Oh, listen, I've been thinking about what you said, and maybe you're right.
I want the woman that I bring to your wedding to be special.
Special like my wife.
We got married!
What?
!
You got married!
Well, look, you guys said to be more serious, and nothing's more serious than holy matrimony.
I mean, this is what you guys wanted, right?
No!
No!
This is insane.
And we were totally out of bounds in the first place.
We never should have interfered - in your love life.
- No.
- Got you again!
- Boom!
That's what we needed to hear.
Huh?
Wait.
What?
What, so you wait a minute.
You're not actually married?
Oh, thank thank goodness.
It was it was just a prank.
- It was just a prank.
Okay.
- Just a prank.
How did you guys get such a realistic marriage certificate?
Does it look realistic?
Oh, that's good.
They did a good job on it, 'cause it's a hundred percent real.
We got you.
We found a same-day chapel, and then we got married, as a prank.
- Wha-uh?
- So-so you really did get married?
Y'all can't keep up.
How is really getting married, Winston, a prank?
The authenticity of the marriage is what makes it a great prank.
- Come on, guys.
- Yeah.
- Says who?
- Hold on.
wh no, please.
Let them explain.
Please explain.
We've already explained it.
A simple prank is a strong prank.
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.
Let's just say I don't know, I told you that I cut my pinkie finger off, and then I actually cut my pinkie finger off.
Mm.
- Is that a prank?
- Is that a prank?
Well, I would not see that coming.
Okay.
Different direction.
Let-let's say that I-I told you that I invested all of my money into boogie boards.
That's just a lie.
And then I took you to my accountant's office, and sitting behind the desk was just a little crab in sunglasses.
Hmm, still sounds like a lie.
And then my real accountant came out and showed you the books and, in fact, I had invested all of money in boogie boards.
That's definitely a prank.
- Yeah, that would get me.
- That's-that's a good one.
- That's crazy, yeah.
- That's a good one.
-  That's a good one.
- I don't understand this.
Okay, so this is like a lifelong prank?
Oh, no, no, we're getting it annulled tomorrow.
- Oh, right.
-  Tonight's the honeymoon.
Listen, a little marriage advice I would know because I'm married a happy wife, uh, a happy life.
- Have you heard the saying before?
- Mm.
- I'm questioning everything right now.
- I swear, I swear I swear He's about 5'10".
Maybe a mustache.
Sometimes he just sits in the bathroom buying music.
Do you think you could check in there?
- Is that him in the RV?
- Oh, no.
He wouldn't be in an RV.
He is, he is.
That's him in the RV.
You look natural behind the wheel of that baby.
I felt like myself for the first time in my life.
Hey, Jeff.
Where were you, and why weren't you answering your unit?
- Excuse me.
- Excu yeah.
Good stuff, Billy.
Thank you.
- Ow.
- Is this you doing your plan?
I don't know.
He keeps changing things up.
He's very good at his job.
Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm Jeff Day.
My brother.
Geoff with a "G".
- Yeah, I came as soon as I could.
-  I don't know why.
I explicitly told you not to.
Yeah, why don't you take a hike?
No one needs you here.
The reason she came to me first.
Sorry, Billy.
There's a little bit of bad blood between my brother and my husband.
She may have come to you for help, but you're clearly not getting the job done, which is why she'll always come back for my help.
As soon as you get a helping of my help, - you're never the same.
- No one helps me better than I help myself.
I told you if you'd just guide me.
Let's not get into that now.
I don't really know what you guys are talking about, but are you still buying the RV?
No!
I'm not buying an RV.
Honey, he's giving us a great price.
- Why don't you get those numbers?
- Don't get those numbers.
- Why don't you go get them?
- Stay right there.
Why do women always bring your drama in here?
Oh, you're blaming me?
Hah!
All right.
I'd like to test-drive my car right now.
I showed you where all the mirrors are, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Now you guys are listening to me!
Get ready for the scariest test-drive of your lives.
Simply the best I don't care if you're hot.
I'm always cold!
-  Slow down!
-  Oh, man, this speed -  God!
-  Oh, God!
You're gonna give me what I want.
I can't give you a thing until I talk to my manager.
You're talking to me.
I know you need to get rid of this 2017.
It's the end of the month.
I know you haven't made your nut.
Okay, I'll give you the original deal.
- The one from the e-mail.
- You'll do better.
I want Bluetooth.
I want voice activation.
-  Oh, God!
No, no!
-  No, no, no, no, no!
No!
Whoa!
Okay, okay Okay-kay-kay I want to feel like I'm driving a spaceship.
- Anything you want.
-  That's impressive.
Oh, that was impressive.
- You're really good at this, Jess.
- Really good.
Now for you two, jokers.
I'm sorry I went rogue, Jess.
I'm sorry, too.
- You told me not to come, but I did.
- Don't apologize to me.
Talk to each other.
Figure out a way to both be in my life.
Otherwise, I'm gonna turn the heat up to 90.
I'm gonna turn the radio to Pink.
And I am going to find a cobblestone street.
Oh, no, please don't.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up, Billy!
You have a little boy's name.
You are so mean!
Now solve it.
Deal with your emotions.
Jess, you don't get it.
The stuff between Sam and I is deep guy stuff.
It's untalkable.
That's right.
I punched him twice.
And I stole his girlfriend.
We're talking about adultery and violence.
That part of the male brain has not been civilized.
So you're just gonna feud forever?
I'll teach my sons to hate his sons and I expect the same from him.
- You got it.
- Thank you.
If you insist on hating each other, do it while I'm not around.
The moment I walk in the room, I want some convincing dude on dude friendship stuff.
I want high-fives.
I want golf tips.
When a hot waitress walks by, I want to see a real nudge-nudge.
Hubba, hubba.
Keep your hands on the wheel!
Easy!
Jess!
I can do it if he can.
I can do it even if he can't do it.
Are you wearing a fake mustache?
Yeah.
Thanks for coming to my annulment, guys.
Yeah, well, we should get to know your ex-wife.
Yeah, like, did she make that mask of my face, or does she have a mask guy?
Rhonda's in here.
Is it weird that I'm a little nervous?
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Rhonda.
Will you make me the most hilarious man in the world by being my ex  - Come on!
- Rhonda's a boy!
Rhonda's a boy!
You ain't Rhonda.
- Winston Bishop?
- Y-y-yes.
I'm supposed to play you this.
Oh, here we go.
Winston, I think we should postpone our annulment.
Until you put the pieces of your mind back together.
I wish I could see your face right now.
But I can't, because I got called up for duty.
Bye-bye, hubby.
That's Wait, so we're still married.
Yeah.
But then how but then how you gon we were we were co-pranksters.
How you gonna prank your co-prankster?
Hmm I get it.
I finally get the prank now, man.
You got Rhonda'd.
I made Billy my baby.
I made that little bitch a bottle, right guys?
- You did a great job, honey.
- You did awesome.
What a terrific hybrid vehicle.
I'm glad that the previous owner scraped off all the "Co-exist" bumper stickers.
So I have no options.
I have no options.
Okay, well Sleep with both eyes open, you idiot.
It's one eye, you idiot.
- Cut your chance in half, you idiot.
- Idiot.
Hey, don't bill me for this.
- Sorry, that was my divorce lawyer.
- What?
!
Yeah, it's been a day.
So I got married.
Then my wife was shipped overseas.
And I remain married.
What?
Who?
When?
How?
What?
Yeah, he married Rhonda.
As a prank.
Wait, you're really married, Winston?
I-I'm not sure I understand the prank.
The prank is, is that Winston's on the hook to send care packages to Germany for the next six months.
Rhonda'd.
Guys, let's just celebrate how hilarious my situation is, and in a very real way, don't tell my mama.
You're simply the best!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
1 Good night, Sam.
Uh, you got any place I can put this change?
Fahboh heh-mah.
: All right, sorry.
I thought we had, uh, wrapped up the talking portion of the evening.
Uh, football helmet.
You're a Bears fan?
Oh, you know, sometimes in life we collect things.
Trinkets.
Some sentimental, some not.
Nick gave it to me.
Is that, is that weird?
N-n-no, that's fine.
I, uh, can't really believe I'm saying this, 'cause Nick being in your life has definitely been hard for me, but I'm getting used to it.
: That makes me so happy.
Hey, this is gonna sound crazy, but my parents are in town tomorrow, and I thought maybe you could come meet them.
Yes, I'd love that.
Good.
You know, family's real important to me, and before I introduce you, I just wanted to make sure that we were solid.
We are so solid.
: Cece.
- : I had a sex dream.
- So?
: It was about Nick.
: No!
: I know!
Where are my leftovers?
What?
Who cares?
I care.
I brought it up.
I left perfectly nice leftovers in the fridge, and I expect them to be there.
Well, now they're not.
- End of discussion.
- No.
Middle of discussion.
You're not even gonna look at me?
When you throw away my stuff, - you're throwing me away.
- Mm-hmm.
I wanted to have cold scallop pizza for breakfast and you took that from me.
You took that from me.
I hope you can live with yourself.
You're disgusting.
I'm actually really happy that you're eating breakfast, Nick.
It's nice to know that you're taking care of yourself.
Thank you.
Well, I'm on my way to meet Aly and her boyfriend for brunch.
: And I am super excited to meet him.
Yeah, that was sarcasm.
And this is shark-casm: I just hate eating people.
Dear Lord, do you mean to tell me that you're going to brunch with the woman that you love and her boyfriend?
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
No, it's not that bad.
I mean, I'm in a prank marriage, anyway.
And I'm over Aly, so - Don't you lie to me, Winston.
- I'm not lying.
You and both know that you are not even a little bit over Aly.
I'm coming with you.
All right, fine, Schmidt, you can come.
But please, do me a favor?
Don't be weird and start smelling people's bread.
Either you eat bread, or you don't eat bread.
There's nothing in between, man.
So in the dream, what was Nick He was wearing this.
He was wearing a frickin' football helmet.
Ah, damn.
What happened next was primal.
Man versus woman.
The ancient battle of the flesh.
Calm down.
It's probably just happening because you're getting more serious with Sam.
Yes.
And Sam is finally, just a little bit, sort of, starting to trust me.
And he wants me to meet his parents.
You can't meet a man's parents if your ex is making love to you in your head.
I need my mind Nick-free by tonight.
On this bed is everything Nick gave me while we were together.
I'm going to get rid of it to clear my subconscious.
All right.
Good-bye, sex helmet.
Good-bye, uh, lacquered bagel with my name on it.
Good-bye, world's tiniest hedgehog.
That was a gift?
Good-bye almost done Rubik's Cube.
Literally, it was one turn from the end - and he would not finish it.
- That makes sense with Nick.
People try to pretend like the brain is so complicated, but I feel better already.
Well, the two most important men in my life are finally meeting.
And for some reason this other guy's here.
Yo.
Hey, brunch is on me today, guys, okay?
So, feel free to add blue cheese to anything.
I'm an agent for animal actors.
He's doing pretty good.
He recently signed the crow from Game of Thrones.
- Darnell.
You know his name.
- Darnell.
That's right.
I didn't realize an animal agent was a real job.
Let me put it to you this way, so the next Avatar movie takes place on a cat planet, and, uh, I was the first one they called.
- Shut up.
- I know.
- I knew you were gonna like that.
- A cat planet?
I know.
He swore me to secrecy.
I was gonna tell you.
My good you know, I always thought Furguson should be in the movies.
Would you interested in, uh, I don't know, taking a meeting with him?
He's got no representation, so he's Let me guess.
Wait.
He has an adorable yawn?
- Yeah.
- Of course he does.
He's a cat.
But can he show up every day to work?
I run a business.
Pass.
Yeah, never mind.
Dumb idea.
Tripp, you have got to sit down with Furguson.
He's literally one of the most beautiful creatures I've ever laid eyes on.
Really?
I thought you hated him.
I thought you hated cats in general, actually.
I love Furguson, are you kidding me?
It's Furguson.
He's got that, uh he's got the little, uh, his, uh You know, his front?
Does he have a headshot?
No, but W-Winston, actually does have a lot of 8x10 photos of the cat's face.
All right, fine.
Bring him by my office.
Can't miss it.
It's the tallest building in Beverly Hills.
Hey, hey, hey.
Where'd you get that?
I got this from the shoulder-less Dutch boy you live with.
- Jess?
- Possibly.
That's mine.
Why are they throwing away my stuff?
They're throwing away me.
Give it back.
All right, but my babies come with it.
I don't want your rock babies.
- Well, I'll just keep 'em.
- Okay.
Sorry, Leviticus.
He's tough.
Why is everyone throwing away my stuff?
First of all, that is not your helmet.
You gave that to me.
And second of all, I need a clean house.
I need a clean room.
A clean mind.
Yeah, dirty room, dirty dreams.
No dirty dreams.
No one had dirty dreams.
What are you talking about?
No dirty dreams.
So there has been dirty dreams?
- No.
- What'd you have a dream about?
It's interesting, Jessica.
What was it about?
There was no dream, dude.
Well, which one of you is gonna crack and tell me what the dream was about?
Jess?
Or Cece?
You looked at the helmet.
- Cece!
- I did not.
I did not.
You had a sex dream about a Bear's helmet?
Who was wearing it?
Ditka?
Vic Fangio?
John Fox?
Our GM, Ryan Pace?
He's cute, but come on.
She doesn't know any of those people, Nick.
- Cece!
- So She doesn't know those people.
So it was somebody you know.
There wasn't No.
Absolutely not.
No.
Oh, my God.
You had a sex dream about me.
No.
It was no there was no Well, well, well, well, well.
- Thanks a lot, Cece.
- That was my bad.
I'm sorry.
Pancakes and syrup, girls.
Let's eat.
Nick, I have to meet Sam's parents tonight.
I don't have time for this.
What will it take for you to just forget about this and get rid of the helmet?
Oh, just every single detail - about the dream.
- Damn.
Now, and this one is a biggie, - was I 100% percent human?
- What?
Obviously.
Okay, I'm just trying to figure out the reality of the dream.
Well, we were having sex, so in that sense, it was not reality-based at all, because that's never gonna happen again.
Oh!
You sound like the beginning of a Salt-N-Pepa song, and I just wish we could just, like, act like adults.
Definitely, definitely, definitely, definitely.
Were you just recreating our best encounter?
Was it Glove City again?
- Our best was not Glove City.
- Oh, it wasn't?
It was for you, but not for me.
So what was our best, in your opinion?
Ooh, you just walked right into that one.
Okay, it wasn't something that actually happened.
It was historical.
Oh, historical, so was there a dragon?
No, it was historical.
You think dragons are real?
I think there's a lot of debate about it.
And there's a lot of blogs about it.
And I know that as a fact, 'cause I've written one.
Do you think dinosaurs are dragons?
There's debate about dragons, Jess, and we're not doing this right now.
Wow, this office is nice.
M look, this is so nice of you, man.
You didn't really have to come.
Of course, I came.
I believe in yo I believe in Furguson.
Is that offer a joke?
Huh?
Because I will feed you to my eagle.
'Sup.
Let's talk puss.
Ready to show me your hairy little guy?
- What?
- Ugh.
Oh.
Yes, uh Introducing The mouse murderin', the heart burglarin', the king of the kennel, Furguson Michael Jordan Bishop.
He's lickin' his no-no.
America's sweetheart.
All right.
This is catnip oil.
The professional cats don't need it to come out of the box.
Who's a good cat?
Who's a good cat?
Who's a good cat?
Not you.
This cat doesn't have it.
- What?
- Let me show you something.
This is a star.
This is Patches.
If you find yourself at the intersection of Grace and Courage, look up.
The street sign says, "Patches".
She is "bang, marry, kill" in one furry little package.
You want to own her.
Run to her.
Run from her.
- Wow.
- Most of all, you want to watch her.
Patches is a trash cat.
This is who you take to the Avatar audition.
This is sexy.
And this?
This is normal.
And normal doesn't pay for the cruise in the Arctic that I'm taking Aly on.
Unless I sign a baby walrus and then the whole thing's a write-off.
That was humiliating.
Yeah, for Tripp.
Because Furguson is gonna book Avatar.
I stole the script off of his desk.
We're gog to crash that audition today.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Oh, uh, two, please.
- You got it.
-  -  What's his name?
Josh.
So your football helmet was caked in soot.
Why was I a chimney sweep?
Well, a chimney is hollow and you're just like jamming - something into it.
- What does that have to do with sex?
- Get a hold of yourself.
- Sorry.
So you took me to a dark, Victorian alley.
It was filthy.
I was on top.
Okay, I'm okay with that.
Our passion drowns out the coughs from the orphans inside.
And then Winston brings us scones.
And that's it.
Really sweet of him.
I'm starving after sex, especially when I have to lay on my back.
You're starving all the time.
- Who invited you in this room?
-  All right?
Are we good?
Can we get rid of the helmet?
I'm concerned, as a friend, that Sam isn't satisfying you sexually.
I can confidently say that's not what this is about.
Maybe he's just not rotating your tires enough, Jess.
What?
You know you need that at least once a month.
Nick.
For sex, that's not enough.
And for literal tire rotation, that's way too frequent.
Not when you drive like I do.
Not when you drive like I do.
I have to get ready to meet Sam's parents.
Will you please get out of here?
Yes.
I'm leaving, but I will not throw away this helmet.
Why?
You didn't care about that helmet when you gave it to me?
Yes, I did.
It was a Christmas gift.
I gave you a Christmas present, and you said, Christmas?
What?
Hold up.
And then you went and got that helmet.
Unwrapped.
What was I supposed to do with it?
- Wear it?
- I wouldn't do Oh, the perfect ensemble for a night at the theater.
Throw whatever you want at me, Blue Men.
- I'm ready.
-  Oh, crap.
That's Sam.
Ugh.
Okay, why won't this come off?
Probably because it's a child-size medium.
What?
!
Why would you give me a child's helmet?
I didn't think you were gonna put it on.
Cece, help me, help me.
- Yeah, I got it.
- I can't meet Sam's parents like this.
Okay, ready?
It's not going to help.
Okay, no, it's-it's really stuck, babe.
Suck your head in.
I can't suck my head in.
Then throw a jersey on and pants, and just pretend you're a little football player.
I can't go out with a helmet.
You look ridiculous.
I'm aware.
Cece, can you go out there and stall Sam?
He knows that Nick gave me this helmet -  - and he can't see me in it.
Okay, what's my lie?
Chlamydia?
No!
No!
Anything else.
Literally, anything else.
Okay, anything else, okay.
Hey, hey, Legs.
What's up?
You and I have never really clicked, huh?
Oh, boy.
Wow.
Oh, my God.
Patches is walking like a person.
This was a enormous mistake.
Is it, um, hard being a doctor?
- Yeah.
- Oh.
What's taking Jess so long?
Get!
Off!
- Stop, you're gonna break it.
- My!
Head!
Whatever.
I'll buy you a new one.
You can't.
My dad gave it to me.
You gave me something that your dad gave you?
Well I just used it to put dirty change in.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't like talking about emotional stuff, especially about my dead father.
No, I yeah.
I get it.
I get I get it as much as someone who has two, living, healthy parents can.
Easy.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
That was was that too harsh?
I just I'm messing everything up.
You know what?
I'm just gonna tell Sam everything, and I'll see what happens.
No.
I think I know how to get it off.
Okay, run backwards.
- Yeah, it's not working.
- It's not working.
You run backwards.
- It's moving.
Rock with me.
- Okay.
- All right.
Well, don't stop.
-   You got to keep going.
Do it harder.
If it slips out, tell me.
I don't want to accidentally put it back in.
Don't stop, Whatever you do, don't stop.
Just relax.
- Don't stop.
-   - Jess?
- Oh.
Oh.
No, no.
There was a scallop pizza No, I was mad at Nick, - and it was in the fridge.
- so I put the helmet on.
Schmidt threw it away.
What is going on here?
Okay, um  I had a sex dream about Nick.
Let me back up.
Last night, you asked me about this helmet.
Sorry.
Let me fast forward.
The helmet's stuck on my head.
Look, I know this is a lot to ask, but is there any way, you could just trust me when I tell you that it was just a stupid sex dream.
Okay, yes.
Yeah, no.
I trust you.
Thank you.
But right now, my parents are expecting us.
So, you know, a lot of kids come into the hospital with stuff stuck on their head.
Do you guys have a screwdriver or a hammer?
Oh, uh, we can't break it 'cause Nick's dad gave it to him.
Right.
Uh, well I have to go meet my parents, so I'll call you tomorrow.
Hey.
What are you doing out here, man?
I'm sorry I got us into this, Winston.
That frickin' cat's a genius.
Yeah.
I don't want to humiliate your cat.
I care about Furguson.
I don't want I don't want that poor thing to be humiliated.
Hey, hey, hey.
I can't imagine his self-esteem level already.
It's got to be very low.
Through the frickin' roof, the self-esteem.
Don't worry about Furguson, okay?
Okay, I can't do this anymore.
Are we talking about Furguson, or are we talking about you?
- We're talking about me, okay?
- I knew it.
Furguson is me.
Patches is Tripp, all right?
I knew we've been dancing around that all day.
Can we please go?
I haven't eaten anything in six hours.
You know what?
No.
Patches may know a lot of tricks, but you know how Furguson's gonna get Aly?
I think you're getting lost, Winston, but keep going.
He's gonna keep trying, okay?
He's never gonna give up.
That's his trick.
Now come on, man.
Let's get back in there.
Come on.
- Come on.
- All right.
- Let's go.
- Yeah, no.
Let's do this.
Let's go.
What are you guys doing here?
Wait a second.
You're not auditioning that housecat, are you?
Oh, that is exactly what I'm doing.
Tripp, can I borrow that catnip oil just for a sec?
Sure, but I think you know very well it's not going to help you in there.
We'll see about that.
Oh, my God.
That stuff is so concentrated.
What are you doing?
-  - Aha!
It looks like Patches is gonna have a little trouble concentrating on her audition.
God save me.
Furguson, avenge me!
Avenge me!
I need a straw.
Ugh, I should be charming the pants off Sam's parents right now.
Jess.
We're gonna break it.
But what about your dad?
Look, it sucks to admit, but Sam's a really good guy with above average handsomeness.
And he's above six feet tall, which I know means a lot to you.
And he makes you happy, and so I think it's time for me to stop coming in between you guys.
Let's do this.
Let's have a little bit of fun, huh?
I will be going on the count of three.
One, zero, two, three, four What are you doing?
You never go on three.
You want to catch the patient off guard.
It's less scary that way.
Everybody knows it.
It's just a doctor trick.
Nick.
So this time I am going on three.
- One, two, three, four - Do it!
So this is the famous Patches.
No.
I am Winston L'andre Bishop and this is: the king of cats.
Lover of mats.
No friend of rats.
The kitty from Angel City, Furguson Michael Jordan Bishop.
He just, poof I'm gonna try to settle him down.
and disappeared.
What would you do if your son was at home Crying all alone - On the bedroom floor - Oh, my God, he's singing to the cat.
- Come on.
- He's singing to the cat.
Let's get out of here.
It's okay.
We're here.
We're here.
Okay, Patches is here.
I was four steps away from freedom  and I fell.
Oh, they were on me, and they traversed me.
It was like I was their city and they were all rushing to work.
May I just please take a moment with Patches?
She needs a, a moment to center herself.
She almost OD'd on catnip.
Forget about Patches.
You should represent more cats like Furguson.
- What?
- What?
You were laughing at him.
He's an original.
Makes Patches look like a Culkin brother.
What?
!
It's hard to celebrate this moment with so much cat hair in my mouth.
You did it, buddy.
Really?
Really?
Now you're gloating?
- Huh?
Winston?
- Ah.
Do you have to be such a dick?
I mean, you're already so intimidating.
Do you have to go out of your way to actually get at me?
Intimidating?
Aly talks about you all the time, obviously.
You're a cop.
You're a hero.
Last weekend, I went to a turtle's birthday party.
This is oddly emotional.
- You're intimidated by me?
- Yes.
It's funny how life works, man.
It's ironic.
This is amazing.
You know what, Tripp?
You don't have to worry about Furguson competing with Patches.
Yeah.
I'm taking him out of the game.
I don't like this life for him.
Oh, yeah!
You blew it, son.
Oh, God, am I unhappy.
- I'm casting cats.
-  Hi.
So sorry I'm late.
It's a long story.
- I'm really glad you made it.
- Me, too.
- Uh, Dad, Dad, this is Jess.
- Hi.
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Oh.
Huh.
A little piece of helmet.
What did you think of Tripp?
I know he's a little intense.
Well, look, I mean, if he makes you happy, then, uh and I like him, so Thanks.
You know, for a guy who eats his raisins hot, your opinion means a lot to me.
Thank you.
What's up with Schmidt?
Oh, he's haunted.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Did you have a dream last night?
Yeah, just the usual.
You know, the one where I'm in a muffin test kitchen and Hillary Clinton tells me my muffins suck.
So that's the regular one.
Got you a present.
- Can I open it right now?
- Yes.
Oh.
I thought you could hang it on the wall here.
I love that.
It's like your dad's looking over the bar.
Aw, thank you, Jess.
It's really nice.
All right.
Now to be fair, I've had some sex dreams about you, too.
First, there was the one where I was a spider and instead of legs it was penises.
- No, I'm out.
- It was eight penises - Yeah, I know.
- Oh.
You were there, too.
I'm out.
- Was I there?
- And I'm out.
Oh, that would've been so cool.

You failed the test.
Hugs are not tough.
Bro fail.
Big-time bro fail, Nick.
What is going on with you?
Yeah, babe.
Just because a scary man yelled his name in your face doesn't mean you can't like sake baths.
This has nothing to do with me being yelled at.
- Yeah, okay.
- This has everything to do with a road trip.
Road tri Are we Are we not cheering on that one?

Hey, hey, hey, huh?
Welcome fellow groomsmen.
Big Schmidt, your minivan is sweet as hell, dude.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I got it for the kids, but, uh, it's not quite the chick magnet - I was hoping for.
- Yeah, of course not.
I mean, I-I am straight hounding for some Sin City strange, you know.
I don't care if it's a man, woman, or child.
You really should care if it's a child.
- Yeah, them kids, man.
- Yeah, no children.

I was just listing Ah, Vegas.

Hot bachelorette party goss.
"With Aly, Tripp.
On the squirts"!
That's weird.
Uh, why would she be with Aly and her boyfriend?
Why does she need to tell me?
Maybe they're having problems.
She's, uh, with my partner, Aly, who, I'm in love with, but she has a boyfriend, you know.
And I'm married to Rhonda, but it's a prank.
It's a whole story, I'm prank Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Too many lady problems, all right?

I was looking at this-this children's book.
Yeah, this ugly duckling about to be fine as hell at the end.
Sexy ass swan.
Got me picking feathers out of my teeth for days.
It's not the feathers you have to worry about.
It's the eggshells.
Ow!
Damn it.
Oh, shoot.
Hey, hey!
No, no No.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Whoa.
I didn't know you could fall off those things.
Well, you can't, but I did it anyway.
'Cause I'm not friggin' tough enough to ride a mechanical tricycle.
Hey, it could have happened to anybody, Schmidt.
No, it couldn't have.
- It could only happen to me.
- You crashed.
You chunked.
You beefed.
You came off your bike.
That's cool as hell.
You got injured.
Yeah, you know, my neck does feel a little I don't know off.
Well, yeah, your neck's off.
It's-it's hurt.
You got hurt on a hog, man.
And what are you gonna do with that pain?
What does a man do about that pain?
- He takes a bubble bath.
- No.
He drinks the pain away.
Here's what we're gonna do.
You see that biker bar?
We're gonna walk inside.
You're gonna take your helmet off.
You're gonna slam it down.
You're gonna tell somebody to watch it.
You're gonna put Seeger on the jukebox.
And you're gonna drink some whiskey.
Some clear-cut accomplishables.
That sounds pretty manly.
All right, my man.
Give me some skin.
Ah, Schmidt.
Come on, that didn't hurt.
It's too hard.
It hurt.
It honestly hurt.
You're strong.
Look, man, I do you know.
Feel good?
- I am, I'm feeling better.
- You back?
Who's the butchest guy on this roadside?
Me.
What are we doing?
Stopping for coffee?
Let me get a scone.
Unless it's raspberry, in which case I'll take a chocolate chip cookie.
- That's it.
Give me the phone.
- Whoa, no, no, no, no.
Look, I just texted Jess to see if Aly and Tripp broke up, okay?
And she's replying, man, the dots are up.
All right?
Look, I need to know if Aly is single.
Oh, all right, well, let me see real quick.
Yeah.
Give me that thing.
Hey, hey, hey.
Oh!
Oh!
That ding.
That ding.
That's for me.
That's for me.
You got to let me check.
Hell no.
Uh-uh.
This phone is on lockdown in pocket town.
Did you hear what I just said?
- It's good.
- Hey, guys!
Eagle eyes has found the road house.
So let's!
I don't why I led out with "let's" like that.
I feel like I have nowhere to Let's rodeo.
- Oh, these people are real desert-y.
- I don't think this is the kind of place where you're gonna want to s Somebody watch that.
I must say, this is not my favorite sort of white people in here.
Me neither.
My favorite kind of white people are redheads with high socks.
Male or female.
Hey, hey.
Um, remember earlier, when you took my phone and it went "ding"?
Wait a minute.
There's a desert flower over there who needs a little watering.
What's Schmidt doing?
Oh, he's not even looking at the buttons.
Hey, what's going on?
Come here.
Unplug it.
Unplug the whole thing.
Whoa.
Good thing that's over.
We can come back from this.
Buy everybody in here a drink.
That's a cool move.
That's a Rat Pack move.
Can I buy you a drink?
Um, uh, a beer?
A bock, maybe?
You've got some amber in-in your necklace.
Uh, maybe an amber bock.
Nick?
Nick?
I got to tell you, I love that vest.
Desert fashion has a certain functional sensuality that I really respond to.
I made it out of my dead Rottweiler.
You dirty little rattlesnake.
You know, I've got a picnic blanket in my minivan, we could go You know what?
If you're gonna be traveling in my minivan, you're gonna live by my rules.
Now go over there and sit down.
You know, I'm willing to bet, you got a big spider in your hair.
When I come back, I intend to find it.
I'm not mad.
I'm just incredibly disappointed in you.
- Five whiskeys, please.
- Coming up.
You're doing them all.
That's too much whiskey for my frame.
No, no, I know it seems like a lot, but binge drinking can be a fun and safe way to engage with life.
This is one of your dear friend's bachelor parties, you know?
If you miss out on it now, you miss out on the memories forever, Wally.
My name's Winston, but you're absolutely correct, man.
I should not be sitting here, thinking about Aly.
She's never going to go for a guy like me.
Clearly living in a fantasy world.
I should be getting drunk with you guys in this disgusting bar.
Hear, hear.
Cheers to that.
- Oh, that is low quality whiskey.
- Yeah.
Hey, barkeep.
Let me get a whiskey on ice.
What?
What'd I say?
Did he say something about ice?
Where are you boys from?
I'm from Los Angeles.
East side.
The more uh east east downtown.
Big city boys trying to come to our desert and freeze the little water we got left.
'Cause you're too soft for a hot whiskey.
No-no one's bad mouthing hot whiskey.
Hot Whiskey was my first chat room name.
Who wants a drink?
I'll take a nice warm glass of how about you stop coming over here and using our water to hydrate your daisies over in L.A.?
!
Okay, first of all, let me just say, I think we're all concerned about the drought in California.
I haven't showered in six days.
Oh, so you're saying you want to fight.
That's a huge leap in logic.
- You want to fight?
- Yeah.
I'll fight you and then I'll take a hot shower, you s-sandy lizard man.
Let's do this.
Totally, totally, totally, totally, totally.
- Yeah, let's fight these guys, Nick.
- Yeah, totally.
We're gonna fight these guys.
Uh, but not indoors.
Because real men fight outside.
Yeah, just like real chili doesn't have beans.
What the hell you just say about beans?
Beans are nothing but soggy nuts.
What the hell are you saying about nuts?
!
Nothing, it's a totally weird digression.
It's not what we're about.
We'll see you outside.
But first we got to go to the little boys' room together.
Yeah, we're gonna urinate and then we're gonna do this.
Yeah.
Uh, is there a key?
Do I need a key to the restroom?
Ooh, God, I hope I get to kick somebody in the head.
What are you doing with that window?
You letting a bee out?
That's dope, man.
N-N-N-N-N-No.
We're escaping.
We're not fighting those guys.
What?
I thought you s-said that we're going to meet them outside?
Uh, yeah.
And they believed it.
It's a great trick.
It's how the Millers have never had to pay for a ham.
We're escaping?
How-how is that butch, Nick?
Enough with the butch stuff, Schmidt.
You got to let this Toby thing go.
If I freaked out every time somebody yelled at me, I It's not because I got yelled at.
It's because I got yelled at in front of Cece.
You know, I know she can handle herself, but I need to prove to myself that I can defend her from the lunatic pagans of the world.
Because if I can't, what kind of husband am I going to be?
I understand if you don't want any part of this, but this is something I have to do.
For me.
Okay.
I'm in.
If you got to do it, then I got your back.
There's two of them, there's two of us.
We can do this.
They got a lot of rings, Schmidty.
- We are so outnumbered.
- So outnumbered.
We're not going to win this fight.
That's a little boy over there.
Where'd that little boy come from?
He just does that sometimes.
All right, I'll take the little boy.
- I'm gonna take the little boy.
- I got the little boy.
You take everybody else.
I got the boy.
I'm gonna go for the little boy.
You're not touching Dirt Boy.
Don't touch Dirt Boy.
Dirt Boy touches you.
Why did you not more forcefully talk me out of this?
Why is that little boy not in a day care?
Are we fighting or not?
What are we gonna do?
We gotta do something, Schmidt.
Schmidt!
Schmidt!
Schmidt!
What are you doing?
I'm being a man.
I'm Schmidt!
Schmidt!
Yeah, I'm Schmidt!
Schmidt!
- Why does he keep saying his name?
- I'm Schmidt.
In case you're wondering what my n what my name is, it's Schmidt.
Schmidt!
This is Nick!
Nick!
Schmidt!
You know what would be a good plan?
You get a job at a Raisin Bran factory, right?
You start stealing all of the raisins, okay?
You follow?
Then you hydrate those raisins to make them turn back into grapes, and you sell the grapes.
There's no overhead, and you make you a very rich man.
That's right, Wilson.
You have surrendered to the night.
I'm Wilson.
Schmidt!
Yeah, I'm Schmidt!
My babies.
Ain't nobody gonna touch my babies.
Knuckle up!
- Yeah, I'm feeling dangerous!
- No, no, no.
- Winston.
Winston.
- No.
Uh-huh!
I ain't got no phone.
I ain't got no Aly.
No, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, no, no.
Dirt bike push.
Winston.
Mirror kick.
Hey, hey, that's my car!
Okay, get him!
- That's his car?
- You didn't say that was his car.
- We got this.
We got this.
- We got this.
We got this.
Come on!
Oh, no, it's the little boy!
Little boy, go away!
Hey, where the hell is Big Schmidt?
Keep the vest on.
Here.
For your cheek.
I think some turquoise got stuck in there.
- Here.
That hurt?
- Ow.
Yes, a little.
All right.
Let's do this.
Doggies or trucks?
I don't deserve trucks.
I'll be the judge of that.
You deserve trucks.
Damn.
Anybody else get hit with a geode?
I got hit with a geode.
Some dude stuck his fingers in my mouth.
What is that?
Is that like a desert power thing?
When things started escalating, I just rolled up into a little ball like an armadillo.
Fellas, can I get real for a second?
I was thinking about Aly the entire time.
This is one of her barrettes.
You know, women use barrettes to keep their hairs in different styles.
Yeah.
But Aly uses this to pin her hair up when she's on duty.
And I kept it.
That's how pathetic I am.
That's not pathetic.
It's lovely.
It reminds me of all my old lost loves.
Yeah.
Cece.
Or my ex.
She was a pill, but when she used to go to second base on me, she was like Joe Morgan.
You know, a lot of people don't know this, but, uh, Aly's full name is Alison.
I like to imagine that she was named after the song.
Alison I know this world Is killing you Alison Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba My aim is true.
Sorry I got us into this, Nick.
I was useless out there.
I didn't even get one punch in.
That's not true.
You hit me a little bit.
I got my ass whomped out there.
Got whomped up and down the road.
- What's whomp?
- Like a whomp-down.
- Oh, whooped?
- Whomped.
Are you talking about getting beat up?
- Yes.
- Whooped.
I got this calendar bod, but it doesn't hold up in battle.
Look, it's 2016.
She's not looking for a strong husband.
That no, tha-that's not what I was gonna That's not where I was going with this.
I'm getting married, Nick.
How am I going to defend Cece?
She deserves the best husband in the world, and what if I don't have what it takes?
Of course you have what it takes to be a modern husband.
Do you have what it takes to be a husband of the old world?
God, no.
They would use you as a pelt.
Today, you fought, kinda.
You're gonna make a great husband to Cece.
- How do you know?
- Because I know.
- Because why?
- Because.
Look what happened here today.
Because why?
Beca ever since I've known you, you've been there.
Okay, you're always there.
Even when I don't want you there, you're there.
That's what a husband does.
You fight for me.
That's what a husband does.
You care about what I eat.
That's what a husband does.
You've cooked for me, even when I don't ask.
That's what a husband does.
When I pass out, you comb my hair so there's no knots in it.
That's what a husband does.
So, guess what.
You're gonna be a great husband to Cece because you're a great husband to me.
So that's how I know.
You're, you're like my husband.
You're like my wife, but Yeah, so that's how I know.
Thanks for saying that, man.
Yeah, man.
I need this to be done, okay?
Well, you can't take it back.
I heard you say it, Nick.
Hey, hey, hey.
What you guys up to?
We're pouring out one for our lost loves.
Good-bye, unrequited love for Aly.
May I now heal and, and move forward.
I'm proud of you, man.
And as a gift, I'm gonna give you your own property back.
You don't have to do that.
I mean, it's not I don't really need it, but Whoa.
Aly is single.
- Aly is single!
- Nice!
Oh, great.
Hey.
Hey.
Okay, so are you gonna tell her how you feel?
I don't know.
I don't know, uh, I don't know, I mean, what if she doesn't like me back?
What if I'm not good enough for her?
What if I can't bear her sons?
You have to try.
Look, I didn't think - I was good enough for Cece.
- You aren't.
Winston, I don't know how this is going to work out, but you need to know that you're good enough.
You got a heart of gold.
You got a smile that He's been having some really nice moments today and then kind of freaking out.
You son of a bitch!
So, what, you guys think I should tell her how I feel?
Yes.
You absolutely should.
Let's go now.
What about your bachelor party?
Who could want anything more from a bachelor party than their best friend - telling him that they love him.
- No.
For real?
You said that?
I didn't tell him that I love him.
Let's be clear about that.
- I missed that?
- You know what?
I'm gonna tell Cece how I feel about her.
I'm gonna get her back.
You do that, bud wait, wait.
What?
You guys go on ahead without me.
I'm gonna hang back here for another round with my desert queen.
Besides, there's nothing for me in the city.
Wait a second.
Don't you have two kids?
Yeah.
I'll be back Sunday.
I got to pick them up from swim camp.
Good luck, fellas.
We should go now.
Let's do it.
- We're men.
- Men!
- Let's ride.
- Let's ride.
- Let's ride.
- Let's ride.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm good.
- Men.
We're men.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sit.
Sit.
Sit.
Best bachelor party ever, Nick!
What's that, man?

Wait a minute, you ninny, we tied for first place, - you and I. - Man, I I-I love Schmidt, you know I love Schmidt, but I would throw it all away for Gilbert.
I would just ruin my life to that boy.
I'm just sorry you had to share it with me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The very fact that socks exist is proof that shoes don't work.
Oh, my God, I my hearing is, like, so good without my glasses on.

Just eating up sounds with my ear mouths.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

Oh, my God.
Okay, this stuff is really strong.

Your calves look like a snake swallowed a bag of ropes.
You know that, right?
I'm sorry for my friend objectifying you, but in her defense, you are fine as hell.
Fine as hell!
I know you're not a stripper, but is there any way you could just take your short pants off?
Mm-hmm.
Have a nice day.

Crockpot!
Kettle, kettle!
Espresso maker!
Trivet!
Melon baller!
It's a bread maker?
From oh, from Schmidt's mom.
"Cece, this bread maker couldn't be easier to use".
"It has one button".
"Even you can do it with a few tries".
"Ha, ha, Louise".
What does that mean?
!
Oh, no.
She Oh, no!
I mean, is she trying to say that I can't even push one button?
She doesn't think that I can take care of her precious, little boy.
She doesn't like that Schmidt does - all the cooking - Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
This simple bitch wants you to be some kind of June Cleaver, Betty Draper, Carol Brady wifey?

We just had this conversation outside the mall.

It's my fifth year anniversary of being a cop and he's supposed to make me dinner if he ever gets off the phone.
Hey, babe, I need a left-handed spatula, okay?
Don't tell me it's not a thing; it's a thing.
Soul mates do exist.
What a wang.
- You know what?
- Hmm?
I'm gonna tell Aly that Winston's in love with her!
No, Winston would kill you.
Okay, I'll just text Winston and I'll get him up to speed on Aly and Tripp.
Nailed it.
Excuse me, are you actually gonna buy something?
Yeah, we need to buy another bread maker, 'cause you claim we "destroyed" this one "with a stick".
I never said stick and we're out of stock.
Well, maybe that's what you said.
You destroyed this thing with the stock.
Is that what you did?
You beat this with a stick?
No, I didn't, I said you said - you said stick.
- But I didn't say stick.
I never said stick.
I don't even have a stick.
I live downtown.
Well, we're-we're out of stock, so But you-you have one right there.
Oh that's the floor model.
- Can't sell the floor model.
- Yes, you - it's right there.
- It's right there.
We need it to sell other bread makers.
You just said you don't have other bread makers.
I don't make the rules.
Who makes the rules?
Derek.
- Definitely too high - No, I cannot deal - to talk to Derek.
- with Derek right now.
Okay, I have a really good plan, all right?
We just leave this here and then we go do something different.
Jessica, that is the first thing that Schmidt and I own together and I ruined it.
I have to do something.
I have to replace it.
Okay.

What's happening there?
Forget it, okay?

Back off!
Do these ladies look like shoplifters to you?
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
This isn't how you handcuff people.
It's mall jail.
I only have two handcuffs.
I'm an actual cop.
Yeah, right.
I'm a cop!
For the love of mack daddy, - why can't you be cool?
- Shut it!
You're in my house now.
Calm down, sir, your house is clearly a lost and found.
And it's all just baby shoes and babies don't even need shoes.
Why not put that money towards something worthwhile like a cute hat or a raincoat?
A baby in a raincoat.
It's like just like a a little baby meteorologist.
Hey, so, it's this simple, okay.
We wanted to pay for the bread maker, but they wouldn't let us pay for it because it was a floor model, so we had a plan I don't care.
Baby in a raincoat.
This is bad, you guys.
This is really bad!
He's gonna call the real cops and I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
I could lose my job or worse They put me on train duty.
I'm so sorry we got you in this situation, okay.
I am so sorry, too.
Okay, how do we get out of here?
How, how?
Before the cops come.
Oh!
Yes, okay, guys, here's how we get out of here.
We dress up in the clothes from the lost and found, and we start crying, and then he comes back in and he's like, "Where are the girls"?
This is just babies in here".
You're incredibly high.
No.
- Yeah.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
No.
- Yeah.
- Who?
- You.
You, babe.
- How did you know?
Oh, I knew from the first second I saw you.
Like, literally the first second.
Okay, ideas, you, go.
Oh, no, no, no, I am not giving you any ideas because it was my idea that got us into this mess in the first place.
First I bashed Schmidt's $1,200 bread maker.
- $1,200?
- Yeah.
- For a bread maker?
- I know.
That's a lot of dough.
I'm trying to wink.
Am I winking?
Then I got my best friend here to commit a crime, and now you might have train duty?
It's like marathon duty but without the hot guys pooping their pants.
What does that say about me if I can't even take care of a bread maker?
What if Louise was right?
What if I can't take care of Schmidt?
How can you say you don't take care of people?
You've been taking care of me my entire life.
You're fierce and you are strong, and you would stand up for anyone that you love.
You're like a big, scary mama bear.
I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!
Ah I'm okay.
You're my mama bear, girl.
Oh I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.
Oh, don't.
- You do.
- I just I've been a cop - for five years and - You do.
Jessica!
I just wanted to celebrate it, but then Tripp had to leave to meet an owl for sushi.
An owl he sent a basket of mice to at Christmas, who I'm pretty sure has a nicer house than me.
Let me tell her please!
I'll blame it on being stoned.
Stoned?
You're stoned?
That makes this a drug case.
Okay, yeah, you have no idea what you're talking about.
- Wait, no, I made a mistake.
- You better get comfortable, you're gonna be here for a long time, lady!
A long time!
Oh, you little power trip trash guard!
You know what?
This is over!
The only way you are gonna get to her is if you go through me, and you are not getting through me.
Mama bear.
Oh Oh, don't do that.
No Oh Hey, no!
No, no, no!
I have a system.
No, please.
The shoes.
I had those all paired off.
Run!
No!
What?
Hey, no, wait!
No!
Mama bear!
That was freaking awesome!
Aly, Winston has a crush on you!
What?
Bishop has a crush on me?
!
Run!
Bishop has a crush on me?
Bishop?
Mm-hmm.
No, I can't date my partner.
Why not?
He's the best guy!
And you broke up with what's-his-name.
What?
No, I didn't.
- Hmm?
- No, Tripp and I are just we're in a fight.
Ah.
Interesting information.
I texted Winston and told him you were single.
- What?
- Oh it's fine.
They're in Las Vegas.
They're stuffing coins into the underpanties of women.
Oh, my God!
What happened to you?
We can't talk about it right now.
We're here to help Winston with Who did that to you?
Where are they?
I will kill them.
Oh, uh truth be told, it was a child.
- Uh, Aly.
- Child?
You're you're here.
Uh, guys, you - you ready?
- Winston.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait.
- No no.

- Don't.
Mm-mm.
Alison - I know this world - Aly, um, look, I really like you, - Is killing - and, um You, oh look, I know you just broke up with your boyfriend, - Alison - but whenever you're ready, I'd like to take you on a date.
A real date, you know, with food, and music Bishop, I didn't - My aim - I didn't break up with him.
Oh, you've got a husband now.
We didn't break up.
I'm sorry, uh Jess said There was a miscommunication.
It wasn't really me.
It was high Jess.
I missed high Jess?
!
Now I have to wait another ten years?
I can't take it anymore.
I just have to say something.
Cece, I'm still in love with you, all right?
Don't marry Schmidt.
That's a big mistake, all right?
You run away with me - Not now, Robby.
- Honestly, stop.
Now's not the time, Robby.
Okay, it makes sense, I I've been in this apartment before, I'm certain of it.
It was 1972.
Gore Vidal, Linda Lavin, and I were all drunk on white port and cough syrup Guys, quiet, please, I just I need to talk to Bishop for a second.
I'm so sorry about this.
That song was nice.
Um Aly is actually not short for Alison but it was really good effort.
Okay, cool, yeah, that's I'm-I'm good.
I'm good, um Tripp, you know, he's a very lucky guy, very lucky guy, but I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.
I'm just gonna go to my room and try to shove my face through a heating grate.
Yeah, Jess, I will deal with you in the morning.
You know what my Grammy always said, "Why put off for tomorrow-day, what you could say, nnn today-day"?
Yeah.
Oh, Aly, um Happy Copiversary.
You've been a cop five years today, and I know how much that means to you, so congratulations, I am very proud of you.
Oh, my Wait, Winston.
Uh, something told me not to go with copiversary.
My first choice, though, was Police Navidad.
No, I just You remembered.
Well, of course, I remembered.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
1 J'accuse, Parikh!
Cette soupe est trop chaude.
You just said, "I accuse you," and, "the soup is too hot"?
Indeed, it is.
I told you you could see your wedding dress when I'm finished with it.
Hey.
Hey, hey, guys, she's writing something.
- Okay.
- Okay.
All right, that's something.
What's going on?
Yeah, but that was two months ago, and I need it by tomorrow night, because I have to decide on my hair, on my jewelry Honey, honey, I am almost done with it.
So you got rid of the mirrors?
: Definitely.
- The battery pack?
- Oh, yeah.
The little weird jacket that makes me look like I'm in a street gang from the future?
All that crap's gone.
I'll have it to you by tomorrow night.
It's a guarantee.
Okay.
I'm screwed.
I can't believe I got to spend a whole day without noodling you like this.
If anyone finds out we're together, they're not gonna let us be partners.
So Before we figure out what this is Just be normal, okay?
No kissing, no touching, no doing that - sex bark you do.
-  - I said not to do it.
-   And also no doing that song you made up about squeezing me tight.
Gonna squeeze you tight - So wrong it's right -  Gonna fly the kite Sorry, I know that's your thing.
I did not know she was here.
I did.
We have a situation.
I want to ask Reagan to the wedding, so I-I sent her a text to say, "Hey, how's your spring looking"?
That was an hour ago.
No response.
Mm.
- Dead.
Maybe she's dead.
- Yeah.
Maybe-maybe she doesn't miss me, or maybe she forgot me.
How could she forget me after I gave her my body?
I thought you guys didn't have sex.
Uh, outercourse.
It counts.
Cece, I need you to send Reagan a text and if she responds, Then we'll know that she's at least alive - and ignoring me.
- No, I'm not getting involved.
: Cece Send the text.
That was terrifying.
Wow, that voice is giving me gooseflesh.
Mm, okay, fine, I'll do it.
: Thank you very much.
You're welcome?
It's so easy; she's like a puppet.
I can hear you.
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.
Just say thank you.
Thank you.
Get some sleep, kid.
You know what, Jess Is this the dress?
This can't be the You told Cece it was almost done.
I know!
I choked under the pressure.
I spent all last night trying to crack it.
Nothing.
I can't make you beautiful unless you let me in!
I've never procrastinated like this.
Well, what a fun, low-stakes time to try new things.
I'm freaking out.
I've been working on this for months.
It's just It has to be perfect.
This dress is gonna be in every single picture, and people will say, "Cece, why do you look so bad"?
Also, "Who is that murdered woman in the background"?
And the answer to both would be: Jess.
This is true.
I see this happening exactly how you described it.
Okay, could not sleep last night.
I'm too excited about the dress.
I'm ahead of schedule.
I'll have it to you this afternoon.
- This afternoon?
-  Bye!
- Oh, my God.
- â­ Ah!
Why did I say that?
There was no reason for me to say that.
I can't work like this.
You have to get her out of here.
I can't take my idea walks.
Your idea walks?
How did you become such an important part of my life?
When I craft, I like to get out of my space, bop around.
I use movement and scenery to tickle the old idea box, but I can't do that now, 'cause every ten minutes Cece comes in here, like, "Hey, Jessica, that dress is gonna be gangbusters, polka dots".
That's a really good Cece.
Also a passable Sinatra.
Jess, what if I told you that there was a place Where you could work in peace.
Um Schmidt, this is the men's room at your office.
Oh, no, this is my wedding workshop.
See, I'm the only guy in the building.
Well, except, of course, for Brian but, you know, I pay Brian eight dollars a day to do his poops at the big box store across the street.
That seems high.
When do you do the work that you get paid for?
Rarely, and it's a problem, but, you know, we couldn't afford a planner, so, here we are.
Please Have a seat at the think sink.
Oh.
Hmm.
Don't mind if I do.
I like its energy.
I will create a dress today.
If you need anything, just let me know.
Also There's a fridge stocked with sparkling water in stall three.
Jess.
Dang, girl, you ugly.
Come on, mouse, how about we don't do this today.
- Bishop.
- Hmm?
Your fingers really that weak?
How do you button your pants in the morning?
Honestly, Sir, with, uh, great difficulty.
You guys should see Bishop load his gun.
It's like watching a toddler eat peas.
Fellas, come on, this is the LAPD, right?
We can't bring this city together if we're tearing each other apart.
God, you're nice.
You're so nice, Daniels.
Thanks, buddy.
Everybody smells fantastic, by the way.
- Thank you.
- That's really nice, thanks, Daniels.
Very nice; he is very nice.
- You wanted to see me, Kim?
- Schmidt.
Why did you copy me on all these e-mails you sent planning your wedding?
What?
Oh.
Darn it.
Sorry about that.
Um, Kim is actually also the name of our chef's new assistant.
To your florist: "Beaming over the peony centerpieces.
No chance I'll get work done today".
To your  "Fat wet beats" FWB.
"What about a swing theme "for cocktail hour?
I'll spend the day brainstorming tracks.
Out".
I'm no longer with fat wet beats.
We had a few conversations and he was being a straight-up ho.
Is this what you've been doing instead of the regional brand report?
It was due three days ago.
That.
Yes.
Of course, I'm gonna have that to you in Why are you Sm why you smiling at me like that?
I'm imagining what it would be like to fire you.
The same feeling I had when we unplugged my mother-in-law.
Beep Beep Beep Is that legal In California?
You've been warned.
If I catch you doing anything at all related to your wedding, you are out.
Jess, Jess, you gotta get out of here.
Je-jess.
Oh, dear Lord.
So, Aly said that she wanted to keep things normal at work - Okay.
- But then she ripped me in front of everyone, dude.
Isn't ripping you what Aly does?
Yes, but we're a couple now, man.
I'm flummoxed.
What should I do?
- Should I say something?
- No.
Don't communicate.
It's not gonna get you anywhere.
What you gotta do is you gotta follow her lead.
Gotta play the game, like I'm doing with Reagan.
I'm play hey, Cece?
- Mm?
- Uh, did Regan text you back yet?
In the past three minutes, no.
Son of a bi o-okay, you know what?
Plan B. I'm texting her from my burner.
- Hmm?
- Why do you have a burner phone?
That's an insane question, dude.
That's not an answer.
A burner is crazy.
Look, if Reagan had her phone, she would have texted me back.
She's probably on a plane or in a spa or  - Well, she just responded.
- What?
!
I said, "What are you doing for dinner"?
And she just texted back, "Who dis"?
So I'm gonna text, "Who you think dis is"?
So now we play the waiting game.
"Karen"?
She thinks I'm Karen.
Oh, yeah, I can be Karen And Karen's gonna get some answers.
You know, as a cop, I find this to be very disturbing.
- But as a friend -  Man, this is straight-up delicious.
Mmm!
Oh!
Sit much, dummy?
: Look at her.
-  - â­Thank you.
She's so stupid.
- What?
- What the hell was that?
Just being normal.
That was not normal.
I'm sorry, okay?
I don't know how to act around you.
I can't kiss you.
I can't prank you.
I can't keep this bottled up.
Winnie needs an outlet.
I know, I know we're incredibly sexual people.
- That's right.
- But if we try We can keep our hands off of each other.
There is that hand I was looking for.
Good job, officer.
Yeah.
Hey, Daniels.
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.
TGI Thursday, am I right?
Okay.
As you were.
That was close.
He saw us.
Ooh, uh, P-Penelope.
Have you seen a girl wandering around?
Um, look-looks like a drawing of a best friend that an eight-year-old would make.
- Jess.
- Oh, Schmidt.
What?
Do you think this neckline is too risque?
No secret, your girls got bombs.
She does, and normally, there's nothing I'd rather talk about, but Kim is on a rampage and I forgot about this fakakta report that's due.
If she finds you here helping with the wedding Schmidt!
Ha, ho You walk on cat feet, you do.
Who is this?
Who's who?
This woman between us.
There's no one else I could be talking about.
There's so many women in this office.
Who is this woman between us sitting on the couch, Schmidt?
I'm so lost.
- Her.
- Now I see her.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Jess is She's the new temp.
I'm Jess, the new temp.
Good, I need someone.
Come with me.
Up, let's go.

I'm gonna tell you right now, I don't want to hear about it.
: She's mean.
Temp!
Come!
Jess, this is a disaster.
We need to get you out of here before Kim actually puts my balls in the jar on her desk labelled "for Schmidt's balls".
We need an excuse so airtight that she'll have to let you leave.
I got it.
My mother is in grave danger.
No, she's not.
Pick up my kids.
All right, hurry up, you almost people!
-  - Oh, oh, oh, oh!

Um Have you guys ever seen where your mommy works?
What do we do?
There's no way he didn't see us making out.
Okay, first of all, you need to stop freaking out, okay?
You are panicking right now, and you're causing a scene.
But listen, Daniels is the nicest guy in the world.
I'm sure if we explain to him our situation, he'll be cool.
All right.
Let's go.
Okay.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, guys.

But you were so nice.
Oh, I am, very nice, yeah.
But I'm also a guy with a huge gambling problem, you know?
Mostly on the ponies, but last night, I lost 60 large on a big game of "I Spy".
Just didn't see that tree.
What are you gonna do?
Yeah.
You know this is blackmail and you're a police officer.
Oh I am a disaster.
So, here's the thing.
Should I Do we have a deal or do I go to the sergeant?
How do we want to?

So You two are hooking up.
- Yes, but - Yeah First of all, it's, like, so new I get it.
I get it.
Winston is hot as hell.
Some days, I'd like to drawer this badge and hold him like a baby.
What?
Anyway, you can't be partners while you're dating.
I'll, uh, split you and assign one of you to our floater.
What?
Daniels?
!
That guy tried to blackmail us.
That jelly bean?
Nice try.
Bishop, uh, can I take a picture of you eating a Popsicle?
What?
No.
Just do it.
Hey, hey, come back here!

Hi, Mom.
I'm fired, aren't I?
Oh, my God, I can't believe we got fired.
You never had a job here.
I'm so sorry, Schmidt.
It's not your fault.
Entirely.
I knew if I took my eye off the ball, these estrogen zombies would suck out my soul, but boy, did I love working here.
I loved every one of these malnourished, high-strung sociopaths.
Do you think you let the wedding planning get on top of you?
How am I supposed to marry the most perfect woman in the world if I can't give her the most perfect wedding?
How am I supposed to give Cece a dress that's not as perfect as she is?
You can't fire Schmidt.
You give him his job back.
That's not going to happen.
Are you sure you want to say that to the person who saw your schedule?
Who would a married woman be meeting at a hotel tonight?
- My father.
- Oh!
Well, that sounds nice.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Jess.
I'm Schmidt's friend and I'm not a temp.
I teach at Banyon Canyon.
Banyon Canyon?
I tried to get my kids in there but there's been some resistance.
They're biters.
Hard to get in Banyon Canyon.
Don't know what it's worth to have a friend on the inside.
Cece!
Will you help me?
I hear you walking.
Oh, um, what am I looking at here, man?
This is rock bottom.
I spent $200 on burner phones and Reagan still hasn't responded to my original text.
Why don't you just text her as yourself?
You don't think it's too late?
Only one way to find out.
All right.

I don't have any more money.
Hey, Reagan, it's Nick.

Uncross your eyes, you idiot baby.
Is that why you have all those pictures of crying babies dressed as vegetables in your living room?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, because, look, I know how much this dress means to her and I I do think that, together, we Dear lord, I can't even look at this thing anymore.
I keep forgetting how awful it is.
Please, take it off of the form.
At some point, we'll figure something out.

- Peter.
That's Sam's favorite male nurse.
He's gotten him two years in a row for secret Santa, and last year, he got him $500, and this year, he got him crayons.
All over the map, that Peter.
So, when you get to Sam's birthday party, is the goal to impress his friends with how much you know about them or to terrify them?
I just want them to like me.
Finally, I feel like I'm in an adult relationship.
He's a grown-up.
Hey, Jess, heads up, I borrowed your towel.
Use your own towel if you're gonna shower.
No, I didn't shower, I just sponged off.
Ew.
Ugh!
That's even worse.
You didn't even get clean before you used the towel.
It's called a French whore's bath.
You wouldn't make a dime as a French whore.
You would make zero dollars.
I'd make millions, millions.
Bonjour.
Croissant.
Millions.
- Definitely not.
- No.
That's disrespectful.
Here.
Happy Bird Day, Dr. Sam.
Wow, you didn't have to do that.
Did you say, "Bird Day"?
You heard me.
Well, you know, I figured Jess likes you, so I like you, too, man.
Welcome to the family.
H-Hey, look at that.
It's a shirt with a whole lot of birds on it.
That's a bird shirt.
Bird shirt.
What?
Why?
What-what's the?
Ah, you know why.
Cool shirt, dude.
We're bird bros now.
And check it out, you can wear it to the party.
You know, nothing says, "This dude is dope," like a motherflippin' finch, am I right?
Sam, I'm so sorry I won't be able to attend your party.
I have wedding stuff.
"Stuff"?
Define "stuff".
Things.
Thank you.
I'm so excited to meet your friends, including Dr. Garfinkel  Sam, I love the way you laugh.
You never open your mouth.
You're always like  I don't sound like that.
No, you do.
You just did it.
Hey, you got to add a flash card.
My friend Diane's coming.
She's in town for a podiatry conference.
She's a friend from med school.
Oh, I've never heard you mention her.
You guys close?
- Diane!
- Hi.
They look close.
- Hi!
- It's so good to see you.
So good to see you.
Way too close.
Hey, Schmidt, how many robots are too many robots?
Hi, Nick.
Gavin.
What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be at Sam's party.
What's he doing here?
Well, after the incident where my dad kissed  If you're gonna barf, just barf.
It's not healthy to hold it in.
Where my dad kissed Jess, there was an accidental pocket dial that actually went pretty well.
He suggested some wine tasting for the wedding, and I said, "Why not"?
You're just gonna drink alone with your dad?
Join us, Nick, the Pinot from my vineyard is dynamite this year.
It's gonna taste fantastic at my son's wedding in a factory.
Gavin, it's actually a slaughterhouse, and you would know that if you were around more.
Can I see you in my room for a second, please?
Look, I know you don't trust my dad, but I'm happy that he's here.
We're working through stuff.
Wait, Schmidt, I want you to have a relationship with your father.
I really do, but I've been down this road so many times.
He just shows up out of the boo, and then all of a sudden expects It's "blue," it's "blue".
Well, thanks, Eye-stein.
He shows you a great time, you get sucked in, then he disappears and breaks your heart, and I'm left to pick up the pieces.
My dad's taking me to Miss Saigon tonight!
And I'm not gonna get hurt.
My dad never showed up.
He didn't?
It hurts so bad!
You want a milkshake, cowboy?
It's different now.
I've heard that before.
We're seeing Jersey Boys!
Wait, this is your dad we're talking about!
And he's different now, Nick.
: He's the same!
I didn't have ice cream, so I just really shook up some milk.
I'm older and I'm wiser, and I'm not gonna get sucked in.
We're gonna taste some wine, and then I'm gonna send him on his way.
But, Nick, I'm plead I'm asking you just be nice to him.
All right, man.
I will.
If it means that much to you, of course, I'll do it.
Thank you.
But if it goes poorly, I'm not putting Humpty Dumpty back together again.
Am I Humpty Dumpty?
Yeah.
I'm just not - doing it again.
- You won't have to.
Also, nowhere in that rhyme does it say he's an egg.
He's most definitely an egg, Nick.
So, what kind of king uses all those resources to put together one egg?
It's a parable.
Humpty Dumpty is the king.
Who told you that?
I've never seen him laugh like that.
What do I do?
Think of it this way: you're a dog, he's a fire hydrant, you pee on him, girl.
- Yeah.
- There you go.
I'm gonna go lift a leg on him.
There you go!
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
So, Sam said he spilled on the bird shirt and he had to take it off.
He's putting on a brave face, but, poor thing, I know he is just crushed.
- Babe.
- What, babe?
He doesn't like the shirt.
- No, babe.
- Yeah, babe.
- No, babe.
- Yeah, babe.
No babe.
Yeah babe.
- No, babe.
- Yeah, babe.
No babe.
Yeah babe.
No.
Yeah.
Babe.
Sam, do you remember in med school when we got drunk and sewed fins on that dead guy?
We made a merman!
Hey, Sam, remember the other night when you ate all that bad crab and, uh, you said, "Not tonight," and I said, "Yeah, tonight," and then you said, "No, not tonight," and then the next night, when you were feeling better, remember what we did?
We we had sex?
Had sex!
The kind where you need a snack after.
Hey-o!
Whoa.
So, Jess, you're from Portland.
Do you, do you miss it?
Do you miss Portland?
I mean, I feel like you never really  - You are you okay?
- Oh, my God, are you choking?
Is that what this is?
Oh, my God, stand up!
Stand up, stand up!
Get up, come here.
Oh!
Here, sit down.
Thank you, Diane.
You saved me.
Any time.
Um, hey, Diane, um, would you like to go to the ladies' room and freshen up?
Yes, Jess, I would love to.
I am so sorry.
I'm really I'm-I'm embarrassed.
- Please, for what?
- No, I am.
For marking your territory?
Look, I get it.
But I was acting childish and dumb and jealous, and-and I I see why Sam likes you.
Well, I see why he likes you, too.
Will you forgive me?
I have guy friends, and I don't know why I would just assume that you're wildly in love with him.
Oh, no, I am.
No, really, I am.
Seriously, I am.
Jess, I'm-I'm in love with Sam.
: Oh, balls.
Now this varietal gained prominence in the '30s as an Italian driving wine.
Now they call it a picnic wine, but we know what they're up to.
But as they say, "Wine is fine, but bourbon is schwervin'".
I think I got a buzz.
Yeah, me too.
Hang on.
Uh, you're gonna like this.
How much hooch do you have stored in this place, you mountain person?
Prohibition happened once.
NICK and  It can happen again.
Yeah.
It was pretty easy to see where you were going with that.
Look at the two of you.
Bonding over the thing that numbs you.
Smell this.
Smell this.
Oh!
Let me get a whiff.
Let me get a whiff.
Oh!
Hurts so good.
Sam.
Guess who the luckiest boy in the world is?
It's you.
It's an extra bird shirt, huh?
I keep an extra one in my car, just in case I get interviewed on television.
Oh.
Thank you.
Put on the bird shirt, Sam.
I will.
When?
When I don't have to take my other shirt off in a bar full of people.
- Ten years?
!
- Yeah.
You didn't tell him for ten years?
I did.
Well, I tried to.
Um, our second year of med school, he went to work with Doctors Without Borders.
Well, so I didn't, I didn't know when I was gonna see him again, and, um, one night, I-I just sat down and wrote him a letter.
-  - And everything came out, you know, everything that I was feeling, everything that I had been holding back.
Yeah.
I love letters.
I know, me too.
We have so much in common.
Arguably too much.
- Mm.
- But keep going.
Well Sam never responded.
I just figured he didn't want to embarrass me, you know?
I mean, I-it's hard when you're friends with a guy first.
So he came home, and we just kept on like normal, and it was really painful, but I-I couldn't lose him as a friend.
Of course you couldn't.
Then last week, this came in the mail.
"Return to sender".
He never got it.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
He never knew how you felt.
No, and I-I came here tonight to give him this letter and then What happened?
I met you.
Oh, right.
- Me.
- Mm.
Here.
I can't throw it away, but I can't give it to him.
Don't worry, Jess, you you didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not the one for Sam.
You are.
I'm gonna be really honest.
Um, I'm having a-a very hard time rooting for myself right now.
That was the most romantic story I've ever heard.
And I don't want to get between them.
Or do I?
I love Sam, and I don't want to throw it all away because she couldn't figure out how to buy a Forever stamp.
Just because you give Sam this letter, it does not mean that he's automatically gonna choose Diane.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Damn it.
Look at them.
Moon river Wider than a mile I'm crossing you in style This song isn't even on our jukebox.
You know what, that's it.
I'm-I'm not losing Sam because I'm some dumb romantic.
Cece, get rid of this letter.
Lett'r done.
Good-bye, Diane.
Go back to fixing feet, you sweet saint of a woman.
You must be so proud of me.
I'm finally being practical and realistic, and not some moony-eyed freak who's seen too many romantic comedies.
I'm basically being you.
Not anymore, pal.
Schmidt's made me weak in my stupid knees.
I don't know.
This past year with Schmidt's changed me.
It's made me believe in love stories.
Is that why you were crying during the bank commercial where the two old people were texting each other?
- Jessica - I know.
They now have the money that they need No, I know to be buried together.
We both know that you're not gonna be able to live with yourself if you don't give this letter to Sam.
Yeah.
What if I lose him?
Well, then you'll at least know, babe.
It's not your love story.
Oh.
I have something to tell you.
The old man in the bank commercial, um, played a Nazi in Schindler's List.
Does that change anything?
I made a model of our wedding venue.
Wow.
Your wine is so good, I really want to showcase it and-and put the bar here.
It's where they store the drums of wild chemicals, but I'm pretty sure they're empty now.
Yeah, it's empty except for the big puddle that never dries.
Oh, it'll be fine.
With your mother there, that puddle will get drunk.
How about we grab some dinner?
Together?
You Yeah, no, I'd like that very much.
I'm gonna run home.
Obviously, I can't wear these shoes to dinner.
Ha, can you imagine?
I'll see you.
I'm going to dinner with my dad.
This is so great, man.
Yeah, it's great.
You guys are finally getting along.
You were like, "We've been down this road".
It's great.
I just want to check in.
Y-You said you weren't gonna get sucked in, and it seems like you're getting sucked in.
Sucked in?
I'm not getting sucked in.
If anybody's getting sucked, it's just me sucking myself in.
- No, I know how that sounded.
- Yeah.
- But you, I mean you - You good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hey, uh, Gavin, hold up.
Um I feel like I can say this to you because, well, you know, we shared a cup.
You really live by a specific code.
Look, we both know how this is gonna go down, Gavin.
You're gonna get Schmidt's expectations up, and then you're gonna bail.
I know.
Just be better.
Be his dad.
Just be there for him, even when it's not fun, and sometimes it's really not fun.
I know.
I've been doing it for 15 years.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
Just promise me if you show up for dinner tonight, you'll show up tomorrow and the day after and the week after, and basically forever.
I will be there.
Will you, Gavin?
Will you?
Will you, Gavin?
I will.
Will you?
Will you, Gavin?
You're really dragging this out.
No, I've already gone through everything I had rehearsed.
I really thought the elevator would be here by now.
We could talk about other stuff.
Can we, Gavin?
Can we?
Yeah.
Can we, Gavin?
Oh, thank God.
I'm getting my birthday present at an airport hotel?
Oh, my God, are you taking me on a trip to meet my birth mother?
Oh.
No, wait.
Um, no.
Uh, it's, uh I have a surprise for you, but it's not exactly a present.
Um, just wait here.
Okay.
Look, I want you to know that no matter what happens, no-no matter how this turns out and by "this," you'll-you'll see what I'm talking about I want you to be happy.
And I want you to be happy.
But what did you want me to be before this moment?
Don't let me get a ticket, okay?
Jess?
Tell Sam.
He-he deserves to know how you feel.
Wow, you are either really cool or really cocky.
You are either really cool or really cocky.
Thank you.
I should've been more clear.
He's downstairs.
I just want to let you know, my shift is up, so Jason will be getting bummed out by you for the rest of the night.
Somebody order a milkshake, cowboy?
Well, Nick, you were right.
I got sucked in.
He was a car wash vacuum, and I was just a stray pistachio.
Listen, Schmidt, it's my fault.
I got real with him and he split.
It's not your fault.
You didn't do anything wrong.
And, Nick?
Yeah?
Thank you.
Thanks for what?
For being there.
What are you doing right now?
- Yeah, man.
- I like red meat.
Yeah, yeah, no, beef.
- Sexy ladies.
- Boobs.
- Moobs.
- B-Boobs.
- Big boobs.
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, don't, don't, don't!
Wait!
Wait, guys, wait.
I know I should have been here an hour ago, but I was at the warehouse getting your security deposit back.
Why would you Let me finish, trust me.
That slumlord wouldn't give it to me unless I cleaned the place, and once I started I don't know if you know, but I'm a little OCD.
- Me, too.
- Yeah, it runs in the family.
Your grandfather had to touch every lamppost he passed.
He couldn't hold a job.
Until he got a job as a lamppost repair man.
Why wouldn't you just call?
Oh, I got kicked in the back of the head by some kids who were using that dump as a place to practice their urban dancing.
They-they were honestly pretty good, until they beat me and took my phone.
And my wallet and my watch.
I had to run over here well, actually it was it was more of a a walk-jog.
I threw up once.
I'm not very good at doing the right thing when it comes to you.
But I wanted to start tonight.
You are not getting married at that slaughterhouse.
Okay, well, then where am I getting married?
At my vineyard.
If you want.
It'll be beautiful.
I talked to Cece.
She said it's up to you.
I just want you to know, either way, I'm all in from here on out.
We're getting married at a vineyard.
Yes!
Yes.
Getting married at a vineyard.
Yes.
Yes, yes.
So, you just left him there to talk?
Yep, I abandoned my own car, and now, for all I know, Sam and Diane are tearing apart a business-friendly hotel room together.
Well, I'm really proud of you.
I know that it was hard, but it's the only way you're gonna find out what you need to know.
Thanks.
This might sound like a cry for help, but I promise you it's not.
Um, I'm gonna go to my room and I'm gonna watch videos of dogs waiting for their dead owners to come back.
Mm-hmm.
Cece, you want to know what I think?
Mm, not really.
I think there are people who get bird shirts, and there are people who don't.
Jessica Day needs to be with a bird shirt person.
Am I a bird shirt person?
Oh, Cece, why do you always have to make things about you?
Sam, hello.
I forgive you.
Okay.
Okay.
Is Jess here?
She is.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'm just, uh Yeah, I'm really nervous, so I'm just gonna ask you an innocuous question.
Um did you bring my car back?
Yes, I have got your keys right here.
Thanks.
Look, what you did for me today was the most selfless thing anyone has ever done for me.
Whatever if there was ever a time for me and Diane, it's passed.
And when I read the letter, it just reminded me how much that's true.
Now that I know you like letters, watch out.
I have to say, that was the strangest birthday surprise I have ever been given.
Well, Winston took my bird shirt idea, so  You know what, one of these days, I'm gonna get you to laugh with your mouth open.
I know you will.
That's what she said.
No, that's not gonna do it.
That's what she said.
You just said the same thing.
: Now that's what she said.
That's What accent is that?
- It's Italian.
- Oh, really?
- That's what she said!
- Nope, that didn't - do it, either.
- That's what she said.
Now you're just changing the stress.
That's what she said?
- Maybe you should stop.
-  -  That's what she said.
Ooh.
-  Ooh.
That was closer.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
1 Ye!
Tran.
Great lasagna, it was fantastic.
Now you're fishing.
It was just good, and you know it.
You used the cheap cheese, and that was your mistake.
Great noodles, though.
Thank you.
Bye.
We care about you.
- Mm-hmm.
- We did it!
- Yes, we did it!
-  We did it.
Best rehearsal dinner ever.
You guys are a good team.
We haven't slept all week, but thanks.
I work in hospitality, it's what I do.
I've got some cools things - for tomorrow I want to show you.
- Right on.
- Maid of honor.
-  Best Man.
Mayday J-Day.
What's up, Nick-knack.
We're gonna need some more hotties on the dance floor.
Copy that.
I'll get those hotties right over to you.
Awesome.
Thank you for letting us stay in your room.
Of course.
I'm sorry your mother's not coming, Cece.
Her disapproval of my son fills me with a hot rage.
I've repressed into a cyst on my back.
- It's grotesque.
- Sweet dreams, kid.
Night, Mom.
Good night, my mom's friend Susan.
Are you guys sure that you don't want to use the air mattress?
We sleep together.
We've been lovers since 1998.
I want to thank everyone for an amazing rehearsal dinner.
Special shout out to Winston - For a shockingly good toast.
-  Winston!
- Insanely good.
- Dipping in and out of French.
Powerful stuff, man.
- Yay!
- No.
Blessings, blessings on all your households.
All right, I think it's time to get the bride and the groom to sleep in separate beds like boy cousins.
Wait, wait, can we just say good night first?
: We'll allow it.
: We'll allow it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'm gonna do the dishes.
Dishes.
- Break it up!
- What is this?
The last night of drama camp?
Enjoy it while you can because it gets boring.
Same old lips year after year with no spark, just dead tongues touching, like decayed salmon.
Oh, my god, Winston!
I did it!
The night before the wedding, A bride is bound to feel a little bit emotional, so nervous?
I got Xanax.
- Delicious.
- Mm-hmm.
Sad, I have a picture of a cat riding a dog like a horse.
-  -  Is that for me or for you?
- What?
- Hmm.
You freak out, you want to escape to Canada?
I've got our passports and Trudeau pics.
I'm good, you know?
I don't need anything.
Really?
'Cause you can ask for anything.
After tomorrow, you're not gonna be able to use the bride card anymore.
You've got power.
: Wield it.
I'm gonna go crazy doing this For you one day.
Well, Sam is the most objectively marry-able guy I've ever dated.
He's out there washing dishes right now.
Mm.
- And he's so tall.
- So tall.
His jacket on me looks like a garbage bag.
Check it out.
Oh.
Uh : What is this?
What?
What?
What?
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.
Is Sam gonna propose?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
Nick, let me tell you something.
It has been a pleasure watching you blossom into the best man.
Well, thank you for giving me the soil to grow.
Good night.
My flash drive is gone!
The flash drive your vows are on?
!
No, a different flash drive!
Then what's the problem?
I was being sarcastic!
Of course the flash drive that my vows are on!
Ah There's my poet's fuel.
Mm, I might still be drunk from my own toast, but my god, you are gonna make a beautiful bride someday.
Bye.
Uh I'm here.
I heard it.
Let's acknowledge that and, uh, you know where to find me.
It's not here.
I can't find it.
I told Aly she'd make a beautiful bride someday, and then she just bounced.
I mean, why'd I say that?
We've been dating a month.
Dude, Schmidt lost his vows!
For the wedding?
!
No, different vows.
Oh, so then what's the big deal?
What is wrong with you people?
!
How'd I lose it?
I wear it around my neck.
I even we I even wear it when I got a spray tan.
Ooh.
I think I know what happened.
What?
- Is that a piece of my flash drive?
- Yes, it is.
You see, earlier tonight, when we were practicing the hora Winston, stop trying to throw me off the chair!
That's not the game!
I don't mean this anti-jewish at all, But that insane Jew dance has ruined our lives.
I'm freaking out.
It took me nine months to write those vows.
What do you remember?
Cece I can't believe this day is finally here.
And then Rick Santorum said it best when  I don't that's all I got.
That's all I remember.
That's all you remember?
!
My vows were like a novel.
How much of your zombie novel do you remember?
Chapter one "on Jack Granger's 41st birthday, he was shot in the face by his dog Ed".
Understand the situation that I'm in.
You are so lucky.
How-how am I lucky, Nick?
'Cause one of the greatest writers of our time is about to enter this room.
Would you like to meet him?
All right.
I'll go get him.
There's no way it's not him, right?
You think it's him?
It's me.
You know what, just 'cause he has a ring doesn't mean he's gonna propose to me tonight or right now.
Hey, guys.
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Uh, Jess, I have something important I want to talk to you about when you get a chance.
Okay, yeah.
I'll be right there.
Cool PJ's.
I look like the sky.
Okay.
This is happening now.
He is going to propose.
I totally didn't see this coming.
- This is great, right?
- : Yeah.
What was that?
What was what?
You paused.
: I didn't pause.
You took like a huge pause.
You were like - Longer than that!
- Jess What aren't you saying?
That's what I'm asking.
Nothing if you want to marry Sam, I want you to!
You think this is a horrible idea!
You know what the truth is?
I think that you paused on the inside.
- Boom.
- Don't you boom me.
I boom.
First of all, neither of us should want to say boom.
That's not ever a cool thing to say.
I'll decide who says boom!
To write anything, you need to start with a big idea.
In my last Zombie novel, Uh-oh Guts, the big idea was that there were too many guts.
Schmidt, you're gonna say the first thing that comes to mind - when you think of Cece.
- Okay.
Cece Uh, what a You're too inside the thing.
I-it's not that hard.
Watch me do it.
Ooh, now we getting somewhere.
Here we go.
Winnie the Bish, when you feel ready just say her name.
Her name.
I'm gonna need you to say, "Cece".
- Okay, this is not working.
- Cece.
Cece Average worker.
Uneducated, but kind.
Wears shoes, boyish Never really talked to her.
I don't know why I'm listening to you In the first place.
You're terrible at talking to women.
Case in point: You and Reagan.
Hey, did you clean everywhere?
Are you happy?
Are you happy that you said that?
I'd like to smell your towel.
Back to the basics, Schmidt.
Okay, there's only seven types of stories.
- Please, don't list them.
-  I'm gonna list them.
Man vs.
Man, Man vs.
Dog, Dog vs.
Zombie, James bond, stories of kings and lords, women over 50 finding themselves after divorce, and car commercial.
My favorite is, uh, that Toyota, Uh Ev-every the family's in the car You're thinking of the food commercial.
Really?
Fat boy talks to idiot.
Okay, eight, fat boy talks to idiot.
We're getting nowhere.
Winston, I need some of that toast magic.
What do you got?
I'm sorry, but I'm done speaking from the heart.
I Basically ruined my love life today.
- Here's my advice to you.
- Okay.
Keep your guard up.
- Don't be too vulnerable around her.
- What?
Be standoff-ish, close yourself.
When she looks at you, cross your arms.
- Turn your back on her.
- Whoa, whoa.
For wedding vows, that's terrible advice.
Yeah I get it, But you don't really, like, know how she feels.
Did I do it?
Did he do it?
Okay - All right.
- You're welcome.
That was terrible, Winston!
Slow down, take a breath, Why don't we just talk about it and figure out what you want?
No, that's what I always do.
I talk and I talk.
Not this time.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna Push through the panic And I'm gonna Say yes.
Really?
I'm gonna go get proposed to.
Okay, look, well, if you start freaking out and you need anything, just holler, okay?

Sam was reaching for the ring and I freaked out.
How do you know if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone?
You just know.
I don't know.
I can't put it into words.
Try!
There are a lot of words out there, just pick some of them.
Everything inside of me just said, "yes".
I just looked at him.
You know, I just had this feeling that I was home.
That is very beautiful And very, very vague and not helpful at all.
I do know you can't avoid Sam all night.
-  Guess who's back?
-  Coach!
: It's me.
- Coach!
- Yeah.
I thought you got in tomorrow.
I got on a plane, Dropped may off at the hotel And now I'm ready to party!
I had six wines on the plane!
- I call Coach on my team!
-  Coach on our team!
There's only one way to solve this.
Go behind the iron curtain.
You guys ready?
One, two, three.
We got the same number!
That probably means something, right?
No, no, no, no, no.
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
Drink!
I feel like Like you've been avoiding me.
Good to have you back, Coach!
What are you doing?
Here I am.
- Oh, I'm gonna throw up!
-  Where y'all going?
I'm gonna throw up!
Hi.
- You gonna barf?
-  I muffed us!
I muffed us straight to the moon!
I can never write my vows right now, I can barely even spell my own name.
"S", jeans Is that right?
Is "jeans" not a letter?
It feels like a letter to me.
Schmidt, this is I-I know it's something, is it not a letter?
This is all my fault.
I'm supposed to be your best man.
I screwed you, Schmidt.
I screwed you!
I was just trying to make Cece happy.
It's all I want.
It's all I ever want to do is just to make her happy.
Wait a second, say that again.
I screwed you.
Why would you go to that?
No, about making her happy.
All I want to do is make Cece happy?
There it is.
There's your big idea.
There's my big idea.
Yeah.
To make her happy.
That's it, that's it.
There's my big idea!
All I want to do is make Cece happy!
There it is!
"Jeans" isn't a letter!
Jeans is pants!
: Yeah.
Okay, Winnie, you said, "bride," to a girl you've been dating for a month?
I think it's sweet, shut up, Cece.
- Shut up!
- You shut up!
I miss you so much.
Oh, my god, I missed you.
Like, for real, missed you.
It's crazy being in New York 'cause I'm like, "Where's Cece"?
- Right?
!
- Like I was saying, I don't know why I said it, it just came out, And I went from the happiest to the saddest person I've ever been in 15 seconds.
I just need to be cooler around her.
Coach, this is where you come into play.
I need your help, man.
I'm tired of being a sweetie pie.
No more talking.
-  This part of the game, Coach?
- Heavy.
- Why are we out here?
- This is nice.
Oh!
- Dude.
- Hey, man.
How are you gonna ask me to help you play games with Aly, man?
You don't want that.
Be who you are.
Now, the only way to find out why she left, Is to go over there and ask her.
Now.
- Yeah, but - Just do it!
I don't yell in New York because everyone yells there And it's less meaningful, but I will yell here.
Now push the button.
God.
You really don't yell in New York?
Dude, I'm always in a museum.
- Oh, my goodness.
- I'm always in a museum.
So that's basically how you play true American.
- Yeah, it makes no sense whatsoever.
- Oh.
Look, I'm just gonna get this over with.
Um - Jess, I want to break up - I can't marry you.
With you.
Oh.
What?
So I really can't marry you.
No, I get it.
You're in love with Diane.
She's beautiful, she's your best friend, you're both doctors.
This morning, I I went to drop her off at the airport, and I just I just couldn't let her go, and it made me realize that I I just I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and, you know, uh, it's hard to express the feelings in words.
Really?
!
Really?
Why can no one put this into words?
I'm-i'm so sorry about the timing.
I just I didn't want you to have to cut my photo out of all the, you know, wedding pictures.
And then with Winston's toast, with the All the talk about honor and integrity and the gig economy, I just Can we just wait to tell people?
I I don't want to make it about me before the wedding.
Of course.
Thanks.
Hey, I hope I hope Diane really likes the ring.
What ring?
The ring in your jacket pocket.
I don't have a ring in my jacket pocket.
I have a ring in my jacket pocket.
- Yeah.
- This isn't mine.
"To Susan.
Love Louise".
Oh, my god, it's engraved?
How did I miss this?
And the font is huge.
So Schmidt's mom and her girlfriend are getting married.
They're what?
Ma?
Ma?
!
Are you proposing to your friend Susan?
Ma?
!
Oh, Winston, now's really not a good time.
I know saying the word "bride" to you was a little crazy, But let me just explain myself, okay?
What I meant to say is that you're beautiful.
Every day with you is so much better.
Your brain is banging.
The skin-bag it comes in ain't too bad either.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know what, except that I'm not sorry, okay?
Because this is who I am.
No, Winston, I have food poisoning.
Yeah, I don't know who let Nick's mute park friend cook dinner for 20, but I want to find and throw up on them.
That's why you left.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Because I don't like being vulnerable.
It was stupid of me.
I'm sorry.
I I I love you, you maniac.
You love You love me?
I love you.
I love you, too.
Wow, that feels so good to say.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
I Love You.
How is there anything left?
- You okay?
-   So sorry for ruining your engagement.
I'm sure you didn't plan a joint celebration with a man wearing a beer can crown and pillows on his shoes.
Jealous 'cause I'm the true American.
We're sorry we left the ring in your room.
That's what we get for fooling around in your bed.
Something about those high ceilings.
We just like tossing each other around.
-  Hello!
Hey, quick show of hands, - god.
Who's had sex in Winston's room?
- Well, I've had sex in your room.
- I know.
What?
!
Everyone's had sex in my room?
I got weird in there.
I've gotten weirder in there than you have.
Really?
Those pillows.
There's just, Like, extra, like Pressure.
If you don't mind, I'd like to say A few words about my mom and my mom's - My mom's friend Susan.
- My mom's friend Susan.
God, you guys, let me talk.
Look, Susan, I know I never fully accepted you.
I just I didn't know how long you were gonna be around.
And, also, you used to call my mom the Big Ragoo and me the Little Ragoo, and I couldn't make any sense of it.
But You're a part of our family now.

- Cheers!
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Opa.
- Yeah!
- Aw.
- Mwah.
Mmm.
Cece?
Babe, what's wrong?
It's just that you're gonna have two moms at the wedding, and I'm not even gonna have one.
I really thought that I really thought that She would just show up last-minute 'cause she would know how happy it would make me.
I don't know why I'm crying in here.
Jess' room is meant for sex.
- I know.
Come here.
-  So, Just-just hit lobby and let technology do its thing.
Yeah, cool.
When-when I get in there, I'll just hit lobby.
Cool.
Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?
Oh, I don't know.
Come on, Jess.
You know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
I mean, I know.
You do?
Then what is it?
You know.
No, I-I don't know.
What-what is it?
It's Nick.
Things could be stranger But I don't know how I'm going through changes now I could spend a lifetime trying to figure it out I'm going through changes now That have just begun Under a purple sun There's many reasons we are what we've become I'm going through changes Ripping out pages I'm going through Changes now.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Schmidt?
Schmidt.
Nah, it's me.
Easier to clean myself off this way.
Aly told me she loved me last night.
Then she yakked on my pants, and then I yakked on my pants.
I picked the wrong day to start cuffing my pants.
Yeah, she ain't going to make it to the wedding.
Have you seen Schmidt?
This is very important.
What?
The best man has lost the groom, or something?
In what world would that happen in?
In what world?
In what world would that happen in?
It's one thing for Sam to dump me on your wedding day, but then to be like, "You have feelings for Nick".
Yeah, nice diagnosis, Dr. Dick.
- Is he that off-base?
- Yes.
Now, we're not devoting any more of your wedding day to this subject.
Nick for Jess.
Incoming knocking.
Jess, have you seen uh, uh, cherries?
I'm so confused by your question, that I'm just going to answer it, uh, directly.
Yes, I've seen them.
Hmm but have you seen the cherry that I'm talking about?
What do you mean?
I the I was with it, and then the cherry's gone.
This is cherries.
This is cherries.
Yes!
Yeah, I'm counting down the minutes till I can get in that guy's pants.
Ah.
Thank God, Schmidt.
Where are you?
I'm flying to Portland to try to get Cece's mom to come to the wedding.
Hold on, one second, okay?
No!
It was my job.
You still there?
I-I don't know if you remember this, but w-we have plans today.
It'll be fine, okay?
I have return tickets for 1:00, 2:00 and 3:00 p.m. on this ultra low cost, no-frills, disgusting airline.
Tray tables, $12.
Cece is crushed that her mom is not coming, and I can't take a vow that all I care about is her happiness and not try to do something about it.
I know you're a terrible liar, but I need you to lie to Cece.
You can handle this, Nick.
- Schmidt's on a plane?
!
- You said you weren't going to yell.
You said, and I quote, "It's no biggie".
Hey, um, I think I did something wrong with my bangs.
I'll be right there.
- So will Schmidt.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- Uh, no, he won't.
It's bad luck for the bride to see the groom on the wedding day, Nick.
Uh, that's just dumb superstition.
He'll be right in.
Cece.
Two minutes.
Okay, I'm timing you.
I need you to pull it together, and just say something simple.
Schmidt's asleep.
- Schmidt is asleep.
- That's Schmidt's asl What-what rhythm are we doing?
The normal human rhythm.
Okay.
Schmidt is asleep.
Schmidt is asleep.
- Nick.
- Did I say it, or no?
- You said it, - But it wasn't right.
But it sounded very weird.
- But it wasn't right.
- Just say it like all one.
In all one.
Yeah, Schmidt is asleep.
- You could just say, Schmidt's asleep.
- Got it.
Schmidt's asleep.
Got it.
No, you're putting weird emphasis on weird syllables.
- You do it.
- Schmidt's asleep.
Hey, Cece, Schmidt's sleeping, slip.
I'm so nervous, I'm going to screw this up.
You're always so ready to believe the worst in yourself, and right now, I need you to believe the best, okay?
I just need you to tell one lie.
- Okay.
- I believe in you.
- Here comes Schmidt!
- What?
Yo, Winnie.
Hey.
How you going to prank the wedding, bro?
You always prank weddings, that's what you do.
You've never gone along with one of my pranks before.
This is exciting.
Coach, I've lived many lives.
The Winston that you used to know is gone.
A few hours ago, Aly told me she loves me, and that made me a serious man, in a serious relationship.
The Winston Bishop that you see here today is about one thing and one thing only: and that is organizational excellence.
You forgot to make an aisle.
Aw, shoot.
This is a full redo.
Incoming knocking.
Incoming kn Oh, hello, Cece.
Schmidt is asleep.
Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.
I know, I'm an incredible liar.
Yeah, pace yourself, 'cause that was one lie.
We're going to need about 40 more.
Or one big one.
Okay, we tell Cece we're giving her a bridal vitamin, but secretly we give her a sleeping pill that we take from Dr. Sam.
Dr. Sam dumped me.
Last night.
He was in love with his best friend, so.
Predictable.
He's out of his mind.
Thanks.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ah, so we're both going solo to the wedding.
- Yeah.
- We're both going drag.
I think it's stag.
- Hmm?
- Never mind.
Let's go together.
For old times' sake.
Let's go together.
Have some fun.
You're going to need someone to dance with.
You know I'm a good dancer.
Okay, but I'm not dancing - to "Single Ladies".
- All right.
We won't dance to "Single Ladies".
- Okay.
- I might dance to "Single Ladies".
Hey, guys.
Ferguson is on the elevator.
Is that okay?
Reagan's here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Jess, Reagan's here.
My Reagan's here.
Our Reagan's here.
Your Reagan.
- Our Reagan.
- Your Reagan.
- The Reagan.
- Jess.
- Reagan's here.
- Hi.
You asked me to be your date to the wedding, and I had to be in town anyway, so here I am.
Excuse me one second, Reagan.
It's cherries on the phone.
Wedding stuff.
Kitchen's still the kitchen, bathroom's still the bathroom, and Winston's married.
Oh, I know.
He texts me every day.
Schmidt, are you calling me from the sky?
This Chinatown bus doesn't have a sky-phone, or working landing gear, apparently.
They said we're going to be stuck on the tarmac for hours.
You're screaming in my ear.
That's motherhood, lady.
Get used to it.
Schmidt, you are getting off that plane in time for your wedding.
Schmidt's on an airplane?
Cece?
Oh, my God.
Are you sitting on your walkie?
Oh, no.
Cece.
Schmidt's asleep?
This is by far the most romantic thing that anyone has ever done for me.
I love you so much.
This is why I'm marrying you, because you do stuff like this.
This is the happiest day of my life.
It's also so dumb.
So dumb.
Like, so dumb.
Just the dumbest.
I want to take all your clothes off and kiss every single part of your body.
I want to do stuff that makes us feel ashamed about what we've done, - but we won't have to - Babe.
Hey, babe.
Babe.
I want to make love, - fall asleep while we're making love, - Okay, you're on speaker.
You're on speaker, so Dream of making love and wake up still making love.
- Hey.
- Hey, Schmidt.
I'm also here.
Cece.
Listen to me.
I'm not going to miss this wedding.
I'm going to get off this plane no matter what.
You just need to buy me an hour.
We got this.
There's been a minor delay.
The vineyard dog is giving birth.
Get them drinky so they don't get thinky, over.
So do you know the bride or the groom?
The bride destroyed my heart.
I destroyed the groom's Jew penis.
Mm.
I hope you guys are giving a toast.
Ladies and gentleman, I'm afraid it's going to be another hour, and we are out of snacks.
Damn it!
I'm getting married today!
Somebody get me off of this plane!
People are getting hammered, over.
Look at this goddess.
Don't do this to her.
I swear to God, I will scream sing every last word to Les Mis.
Sir, if you don't sit down, I'll have you removed.
- Perfect!
- And placed in FBI custody.
I suppose I'll just have a tomato juice.
Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
How are you?
- Good, yeah.
Great, look at this.
What is that, a towel?
- I think it's a pashmina.
- "Pashomina"?
Pashmina.
I'm sorry, I just can't believe you came.
I did.
Things I'm feeling: excited.
Number two: scared.
I mean, are we gonna do this?
You and me?
Take it home.
Take it to the mat.
I don't know what that means.
You know, like, the big "R".
Oh, a relationship?
No.
No, no.
See when I say, The big "R," I'm, of course, talking about, uh, rasslin'.
Yeah, I think that's a "W," "W-R".
Do you ever feel, deep down, that you know at some point you're gonna have a stroke and it's gonna be really bad?
Jess I have some Honduran matrimony beads for my son.
Where's Schmidt?
Winston.
Winston.
I cannot believe I'm asking this but I need you to prank this wedding.
Please.
Please, we need to distract people.
He's a serious man now.
He doesn't prank anymore.
Just look at his eyes.
All the mischief's gone.
If this were another time, another day, hell, even six hours ago Listen to me, you bird-shirted, puzzle baby.
You get out there and you do something totally idiotic right now!
Funston, we have a pranklem.
I'm not good at these.
It's a weird one.
Okay update.
The vibe's getting ugly.
People are getting dangerously drunk.
I found a loose EpiPen on the floor, which can't be good.
I think we're gonna have to start telling people that Schmidt's on a plane.
Or not.
Don't freak out.
Mom?
Schmidt's on a plane?
Mom, what are you doing here?
If you've come to object to this wedding, you are too late, and in another sense, because it's delayed, you're too early.
That's not at all why I'm here.
Mama P. Schmidt with the latest, "Why I Love Cece".
Today's episode: Honesty with a Capital Ouch.
He called you?
Every Monday for the past year.
Your daughter is the best thing I just lost a fight in the desert, but And I want her to be the last thing I see when she pulls the plug.
But it's not an A-plus unless we both finish.
She's so beautiful.
The odds are really stacked against our children.
They're not all winners.
I just know that if you miss your daughter's wedding, you're going to regret it for the rest of your life.
I am delighted for you to marry this man.
For those keeping score with row five, Cece's mom is at the wedding!
Just get here when you can, okay?
We'll wait until you do.
You know what?
Have the party without me.
Babe.
No.
Okay, no.
Have the party.
We'll We'll get married at City Hall with all the immigrants and liberals and first cousins.
Your whole life has been about this party.
My whole life is you.
Plus, my cousin Nathan is just dying for something to go wrong.
I'm so happy.
I have an idea.
Conga!
Whoa, whoa, running out of room here.
Let's back it up.
Shut up.
Winston, you don't have to prank the wedding anymore.
Okay, cool, cool, cool.
You know, FYI, I was gonna go with a simple, classic streak.
Cece's mom showed up.
Come out to the party.
Oh!
No!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
No!
No!
Sounds like you're under water.
Oh.
As we all know, marriage is about sex and property.
Everybody say that with me once.
Marriage is about s I imagined that differently.
You're okay.
You're okay.
Pull it together.
Just let the index cards go.
Speak from the heart.
You know who I'm talking to when I say you were rude to me earlier at the bar.
And now who's in control?
I could point to you and call you out, but I won't.
When I first met this guy, Schmidt, I thought, "I'm not gonna be friends with him".
I don't like his personality".
Magic's fake.
Believe what you want, but I want you guys to think about something, and now this is off the jack.
In a couple generations, we're all gonna be dead, and no one's gonna remember any of us.
I mean, think about it.
Do you remember your great-great grandparents or or their parents, or what they did day to day?
The point is, it doesn't matter.
Everyone you know will be dead.
That's right.
Congratulations, man.
I love you.
Best friends.
That's my time, everybody.
Thank you.
Look, if it made sense, it wouldn't be my wedding.
Your speech wasn't that bad.
My speech was fantastic.
It's the best 17 minutes of my life.
- I really opened up my heart.
- I was gonna say.
Nah, I'm just feeling bad about Reagan.
I think I came on too strong, or-or I don't know.
She told me she's leaving tonight on a train.
On a train?
Where's she going, Hogwarts?
No, San Diego.
I don't know if "Hog-warts" is near San Diego.
- I've never heard of it.
- Never mind.
But, I mean, it's okay.
I just, I feel like I, you know I just got excited for a second.
Nick, she came here to see you.
I bet you're reading into it.
What if I go talk to her?
Talk me up a little bit?
- Woman to woman?
- That's implied.
Winston.
No hay Weenstons.
It's ocupados.
Winston, I know you're in there 'cause I'm looking at a picture of your butt cheeks right now.
Oh, that's a working class butt.
- Nothing wrong with that!
- Mm.
Give me - Give me those.
- That's a fatty.
You got a fatty.
This is not Winnie's day.
Ernie, give him your jacket.
- What?
- Give me the damn jacket.
All right, here, dude.
I jabbed my giblets in the breast pocket.
Tie it around your waist.
Then that leaves the front porch open or the back.
I don't think this is gonna work.
I'll just sit here cold and naked while my best friend gets married.
Look, you were right, Coach.
I'm not a serious man.
I'm a nude, apple bottom, long-fronted dumb-ass.
Ooh, look.
At least you can change the background.
Look.
Now I'm in the Oval Office.
That's crazy.
Winston, you're a groomsman and a bridesman.
It doesn't get more serious than that.
You can't miss this wedding.
But what am I supposed to wear?
I am looking for the groom.
Schmidt.
What's up, man?
I know I'm wearing a photo booth curtain right now.
That does not take away from how incredibly happy I am for the both of you.
Thank you.
Winston, I'm going to get off this plane soon.
Oh, dear Lord!
Winston!
Pick it up!
Don't squat!
So, I mean, I feel like I really put myself out there, right?
I got on a plane, and I flew across the country to see him.
I couldn't get him out of my head, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then he says the word "relationship," and I freaked out, because You know what, I don't know.
Am I crazy to want a relationship with Nick?
I mean, you guys were together.
What happened?
We were kind of a mess.
I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.
And he wanted me to not care about those things.
That's not so bad.
I mean, who really has a plan for their life?
Who does that?
Me.
Me.
I d I did it.
I do it.
I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there who keep a very traditional banking account.
Yeah.
There are.
And I just dated one of 'em.
And I I don't think any of that stuff matters.
Thank you.
You are awesome.
Thanks.
I'm gonna go do this.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I Yeah, I know.
You don't have to say it.
Cece, Schmidt wants to talk to you.
- Thank you.
- Babe, the plane's moving.
Oh, okay.
Maybe they're going back to the gate.
Maybe I can get there before they release the monarch butterflies.
Oh, my God, that is so great, babe!
Ladies and gentlemen, we are finally bound for Portland.
Aah!
No!
What are you guys doing here?
It's the middle of the night.
Ow!
Winston!
The hell is wrong with you?
We use that stuff to revive passed-out derelicts.
Come on, buddy.
We got to get you ready.
What?
You already sprayed that.
- Yes - You don't have to spray it again.
- Honestly, dude, you're ruining it.
- Relax.
You want to get married?
I don't think that I can wait another second.
May this couple be blessed and be helpful to one another in all ways.
Just when I thought you couldn't make me any happier, look what you did today.
You're amazing.
I hope for as long as we stay together, that I always remain someone that you want to hollah at.
I look forward to a lifetime of joy, growth and constant mispronunciation of common words.
For the first time, I see what the rest of my life looks like.
I now pronounce you husband and Oh, wait, uh, we need the glass.
What?
Hey.
I'm just getting Cece some leggings for the hora.
Can't have everybody seeing the bridal bouquet.
I don't know what you said to Reagan, but I want to say thank you, because she wants to go for it with me.
She wants to do this.
Well, that's awesome.
Congratulations.
Yeah, I'm freaking out.
I can't believe it.
I mean, why does she want to be with me?
It doesn't make any sense.
You of all people know that I'm just the weird detour you take before you find the guy you want to be with.
I basically just help women realize that they could do a lot better Stop it, Nick!
I'm tired of you being the only person who doesn't see how incredible you are.
Okay.
I'm, uh, I'm incredible.
Yes, you're incredible.
All right, thanks.
All right, I'm booking a ticket.
A ticket?
Yeah, Reagan is going to New Orleans for work for three months and she asked me to go with her, and I'm gonna do it.
Don't make this about you!
Get in line and hora!
All right, let's do it.
So nice of your mom to get us this trip.
Much better than my dad's gift of weed gummy bears.
Aah!
What the hell is happening?
