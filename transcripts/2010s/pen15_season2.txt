1   Last time on "Pen15"   Oh, my God, Na, seventh grade!
It's gonna be so amazing.
It's gonna be really, really good.
It's gonna be like the  best year of our lives.
Maya, what the fuck did  you do to your hair?
- UGIS!
- UGIS!
- Wait, what?
- It means ugliest girl in school.
-  Here comes Brandt.
-  He's so cute.
Is Alex looking at me?
-  No.
- He'll probably look at me later.
I'm, uh, I'm Brendan.
I burned this for you.
I guess he, like,  loves me or whatever.
You have a boyfriend!
He put his lips, like,  all the way around mine and sucked.
Well, at least you've,  like, had your first kiss.
But I wish that I hadn't.
-  I feel, like, older.
-  I know, me too.
I don't  wanna do seventh grade.
I'm not doing  seventh grade by myself.
I don't know how to say this.
Your dad and I, we're getting a divorce.
Everything's just different,  and I just have to break up with him.
-   - Welcome.
Oh, my God, some  random guy just IM'd me again.
Flymiamibro22.
Hey, hottie.
What u look like.
I'm about to meet him after school.
You haven't met him in person yet?
Well, no, we've talked on AIM.
He's probably some warty  old dude and lives with his mother.
It's me.
I'm Flymiamibro22.
- Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
-  Maya!
Alex, will you dance with me?
No.
What did you just say to Alex?
That's so messed up.
She took you under her wing.
Nice moves, UGIS.
Want me to finger you?
Yeah.
You have both really hard nips.
I love you.
And I love you too.
- Don't tell anyone.
- Yeah.
Okay, and I'm  adding for you 2,000 kids.
Oh, my God.

Okay, tell me when to stop.
Stop.
Okay.

1, 2, 3, 4,  5, 6, 7, 8   Okay, you're not with Brendan.
Ugh.
Oh, my God,  I don't want to be mean,  but he's like obsessed with me, so  -  He's literally obsessed with you.
-  I know.
Okay, wait, okay, okay.
So you live in a mansion,  which is amazing.
- Yes!
- Ooh!
A BMW 8 Series!
You have four kids.
You were literally one  away from getting Alex,  which is crazy.
I just feel like I want him  a little bit less right now  'cause he dissed me at the  dance or whatever, so   Such an asshole.
Should we even, like, go  to Spencer's pool party?
Like, who's even gonna be there?
- Just gonna be Sam  -  Ugh.
- Gabe, Jafeer I just  -  Yeah.
- Maybe we just stop in.
- Yeah,  like for literally a second.
Let's just, like, say hi,  be seen, and then like,  "Bye-bye, we got places to go".
- Just "bye-bye".
-  I don't know, like, no offense,  but I think we're too good for it.
Like, we're too good for it.
- Mom, straight.
- Yeah, straight.
- Straight!
- It's straight.
Okay, one, two, three    Ohh   I just think the real  thing is that we've changed.

-  Yeah.
Yeah!
Like, after this weekend,  I think we are on another level.
- Okay, my other ear.
- Okay.
Yeah, I'm just keeping  my my options open.
You should keep your options open.
You're literally the hottest  I've ever seen you.
-   What?
-  Anna, I swear!
-  Yeah.
-  You're at your hottest.
- Yeah.
-  We, like, had Brandt J.  freaking like touch us  up at the same time.
- Like, it's crazy.
- That's true.
Aah!
It burns, it burns!
Wait, you haven't told  anyone, though, right?
'Cause Brandt said not to.
Oh, my God, I swear to God, no.
Wash it off now!
Okay, so you have  a limo made of diamonds.
-  Oh, my God, yes.
- And 2,000 babies.
Wait what?
No!
2,000?
- That's crazy!
- You almost got Sam.
- I just crossed out Sam.
- Oh, thank God.
He's a psycho.
-  Oh my God.
- Stop!
Who?
You got Brandt.
No, I didn't!
No, I didn't!
Are you kidding?
- Wait, are you kidding?
- No, you got Brandt.
- Aaah!
I knew it!
-   Okay.
But you live in a shack  with 2,000 babies.
- Do you wanna sign for this life?
- Okay, I mean,  that's tough because it's  2,000 babies in a shack  - Right.
-  But, like, it just means  I get to kiss him 2,000 times  so, yeah, I sign for this life.
Oh, you slut bag!
Anna, shut up.

Don't look up.
Maya just got here.
For the flavor  of a crowd-pleaser    Now, what did I  tell you?
No wet suits inside.
Now turn around and skedaddle.
Ride in my whips   South to the West to  the East to the North   Bought my hits and watch  them go off, a go off   - In the winter or the   -  Summertime    I makes it hot,  gettin' jiggy wit 'em    Na, na, na, na, na, na, na   Na, na, na, na, na, na   -  Gettin' jiggy wit it   -  Na, na, na, na, na    I'm gonna literally kill him  -  Oh, sorry.

You look so hot.
How 'bout me?
Does my bleach look okay?
- You look like a frickin' hairless model.
- Okay.
Oh my God.
Na, Brendan is staring at you.
- Literally staring.
-  Oh, my God.
I feel smothered by him.
-  I know.
-  Like, we are not a thing.
Move on.
There are, like, no prospects here.
No, I know.
Maybe we should just like stay  five minutes and then leave.
That's all I thought we were doing here.
Okay, yeah.
Five minutes.
Just five minutes.
There's nobody here that I wanna see.
Yeah, for sure.
Do you want me to  go say something to him?
- Who?
- Sam.
Oh, my God.
He keeps looking at you.
No, he isn't.
Stop.
I'm gonna go say something to him.
- No.
- He needs to know  that you cannot be someone  else on AIM.
It's illegal.
Okay, fine, like I don't want any drama,  but just like say something to him  and, like, make it seem like  I don't care, 'cause I don't.
Oh, I know you don't care.
- I don't care.
-  I know.
So then just like don't make any drama.
- Just, like, do it.
Whatever.
- Okay.
I think I should also just  go to Brendan, then.
It's time to move on.
- Okay.
- Like, honestly, it's time.
- Okay.
- Like, I'm I'm ready.
- Maya, no drama.
- Okay, no drama.
Sss   Hey.
What's up?
What's up?
Um, I just wanted to have a  mature conversation with you,  if you're all about it,  just address the elephants  in the basement.
Sure.
Um  I just think it's really messed up  that you pretended to be  somebody else on AIM.
Like who does that?
And we just think you're a tool.
So  just super weird  because you used to be our best friend.
Well, there's two sides to every story.
- Oh, yeah?
-  Yeah.
So you're not gonna apologize.
Are you seriously not gonna apologize?
Maybe I already did apologize.
But she didn't tell you  that, though, right?
Okay, maybe she did.
Maybe she did not.
All I know is that she's my best friend  on God's green frickin'  earth, and I love her,  and she would never lie to me.
Ever.
Well, we're kinda in the  middle of something here.
Okay, what are you in  the middle of?
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's it's weasels.
See, I made this whole magazine.
-  Yeah.
-  See, uh, this is one that I drew.
See, it's got buck teeth  - and it's got  - You guys have to grow up.
Like, do you think that this  is gonna fly in eighth grade?
You have to be more mature.
Okay?
'Sup?
- Hi.
- Um   basically, I'm here to tell  you that Anna's over you.
And she's just, like, done,  and she doesn't want  anything to do with you,  and you just gotta move  on, and I'm sorry.
That's that's fine.
I'm dating Marissa H.  Okay.
Cool.
So, what, you're like wait!
That's Icebox.
You're dating Icebox?
She prefers Marissa H.  And just so you know,  she did not masturbate with ice.
- Yeah, right.
-  In fourth grade,  she was dared to put an  ice cube in her underwear.
That rumor's very  heavily exaggerated.
Whatever.
I've we can  have different opinions  on what happened, but, like,  basically, all you need to know  is you need to just,  like, end it with Anna.
What?
It's a good chat.
Sorry I hurt your feelings.
Brendan's totally over you.
- Completely.
-   He is, he's dating Icebox now, I guess.
What?
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.
I didn't even know he was  into girls like that, so  But, like, she's a slut bag.
Yeah, at least I'm not like that.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
- Yeah, I don't care.
-  It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.
It's Icebox.
- I don't care!
Like "I put ice in my  vagina"!
- Wow.
- And she's a slut.
You have, like, so many better  options, and it doesn't matter.
- Yeah, I do, I have a lot.
- You have so many options.
So let's just leave.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Right?
Let's go.
This place sucks.
Blows.
- No stop, stop!
-   -  Is that Brandt?
-  No, no, no, no.
-  Stop, stop, stop  -    -  Want me to finger you?
-  Yeah.
You have both really hard nips.
- I love you.
-  And I love you too.
Stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, my God, stop, stop!
- Stop, stop, Anna, stop it!
Brandt  Stop!
-  Go talk to him.
-  No, you talk to him.
-  Do you think he's here for you?
- No!
- Go!
- Yes, I don't know!
Maybe.
-  He is here for you.
-  Okay, it's like, okay.
-  Go now.
-  Okay I don't know.
Okay, yeah.
-  Hey, what's up, man?
- What's up?
- He's here for Isaac.
- He's here for    He's here for Isaac.
He doesn't know you're here.
Ow.
- Go.
-  Oh, my God, okay.
You're gonna get your  first frickin' kiss go.
Okay, all right.
This is happening.
Let's just frickin' go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Absolutely no coming in the house  while you're wet.
I told you guys that.
- We're not wet.
- Yes, you are.
I can still see a little  bit of water on you.
So dry off, okay?
- Sorry.
- We'll take care of it.
There's a towel.
-  Sorry!
- Thank you.
Thanks, girls.
Sneak in, sneak in.
Come, come  Nope.
Still too wet.
Ow.
My God, she just like    - Am I dry yet?
-  Cannonball!
Cannonball!
'Sup?
It's kinda funny you're here right now.
How?
It's so lame here!
It's my friend's party, so  it's kinda cool, actually.
Yeah, it is pretty cool.
Haven't, like  seen you since the dance  or like talked to you, it seems like.
We haven't, so that's probably why.
Yeah.
Have you, um  have you thought about  what happened on Friday?
I don't what are you talking about?
You're being so funny right now.
You know, like  - Brandt!
- The fuck.
- Sorry.
-  Jesus.
Like when me, you, and   Anna,  like, went into the closet  and you, like, up and  down, in circles  Remember how hard-nipped I got   Nope.
That didn't happen.
What  what do you mean,  it didn't happen?
That  Brandt.
Are you f  I'm so sorry.
What's goin' on?
He said it didn't happen.
What didn't happen?
Like I was just trying to talk to Brandt  - about how we did second base  - Yeah.
And he, like, didn't know  what I was talking about.
What?
Like, he said it didn't happen.
- That's a lie.
- I know, right?
- Like, we did it.
- Yeah, he was freaking there.
- That little freaking asshole.
- I mean, we did it, like,  we put the hands up and down  - and we did the circle motions, everything.
- All around.
- And like one hand on your boob  - It was.
And one hand on my boob,  and he, like, didn't know  - what I was talking about.
- And then there were the circles.
Well, it happened.
Why would he lie about that?
I don't know.
Do you think it's 'cause he  thinks I'm ugly or something?
No.
Be honest.
No!
If he does, he's a psychopath.
It happened, and I think I know who saw.
Hey, Brendan.
Um, I just wanted to  touch base with you.
I know that  little rude to you earlier.
And she can just be that way sometimes.
But I heard that you're  going out with someone new,  and that's fine.
It doesn't change what we had  or what we went through together.
- What?
- Say it.
Um  also, like, you know  how when, at the dance,  like when Brandt just  pulled us away from you?
We were we were, like, grinding  and then he was like,  "No!
You come here".
Do you remember that?
'Cause he's saying that that  didn't happen.
I'm like, "It did".
It did, right, it did?
I don't wanna get involved  with the drama, Anna.
I-I've moved on.
I suggest you do too.
Oh, yeah.
No, I know   To Marissa H. I haven't heard  one bad thing about her, so  Me and her have a really good  rhythm with our kissing.
Peace.
-   -  Peace.
Good-bye.
So somebody saw.
- No  - Someone here has seen,  so we need to go up to people,  and we have to get proof.
No, but Brandt said in the  closet not to tell anyone.
He's gonna get mad.
Please don't.
Maya, who cares?
Okay.
Okay, fine, okay.
We're gonna go up to people.
We're gonna get proof.
We're just not gonna let them  know everything that happened.
We're not gonna give it all away.
Me and Anna and Brandt  went into a closet.
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened, okay?
I'll say a word, and you tell me  the first thing that comes  to your mind loset.
- Deposit.
- Do you know who Brandt is?
He was just showing up a second ago.
He had a butt cut and  he was saying hello.
- Mafoset.
- And we basically hooked up.
I'm not gonna say what it rhymes with,  but it's second base.
You ever seen three people together?
We touched each other, but  on the chest, nothing else.
And he said it didn't  happen, but it did.
You ever been to a dance?
If you say no, I don't believe you.
You bitch I know you're  lying to me right now.
He went up and down, and  then he did circle motions.
And then he did circle motions.
Motion and a motion on the boobies,  you know what I mean?
Maybe he does love me,  'cause he went up and down  a little bit more on me.
I knew it.
It's so weird.
But then he said "I love you,"  and then I said I love you back  and then now he's taking it back,  and now I don't know what it means,  and so I guess I'm just asking you   'cause  you're his best friend,  like what does that mean?
You just told me, right?
You should go talk to Brandt.
Ca-can you tell me where he is?
He's in my room.
From the start,  clearly the aggressor on Ziggo.
ANNOUNCER 2:  Ziggo spinning and spinning    On the back   Undercover   Got caught with the mother   Fuckin' with the rubber   Motherfu   Oh, hey.
There goes  the ramp.
The wheel is off.
- ANNOUNCER 2: Oh!
-  And now look at this.
'Sup?
Do you want me to leave?
Be honest.
It's like I'm stalking you or something.
Do not turn your back  Oh, he turned his back!
Oh, whoa.
-   - This is the final slap of humiliation.
Were you just joking when you said  that the three-way in  the closet didn't happen?
What?
Yeah, whatever.
So you're saying it happened.
Yeah.
Whatever.
- Okay.
-  That is all Ziggo  just tearin' up that wood  like a beaver on speed.
Wait, I'm, like, so sorry  I came up to you  in the pool like that.
- I'm so lame.
-  Yeah.
Whatever.
It's cool.
I still think you're, like,  pretty or whatever.
So could you move?
Cutie?
Okay.
I'll sit down.
I'm missing  a whole lot of examples.
But you fought hard  because you lost to this man  right here, Ziggo, Jonathan.
Yes, yes,  I know pretty well, so   It was impressive.
I want you guys, though, to shake hands.
Spencer saw it all, motherfucker!
Anna, he already said it.
Get out!
He just said it happened.
Oh, you can get out.
He said it happened.
Get out.
Sorry.
Looks like it's just  the three of us again.
I'm really glad that  you guys have made up.
So you said that it happened, hmm?
- Yeah.
- Yes, okay?
Just keep your mouth shut about it.
I don't want that getting out.
-  Yeah.
- Okay.
Nobody knows.
But I didn't tell anybody   - I didn't tell   - Do you tell  But he just maybe said I'm perfect   Guys, I'm trying to watch this.
Who's in there?
Oh, my God.
What are you doing in Isaac's  room with the door closed?
And is that a wet bathing suit?
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Out.
-  Sorry.
-  Yeah.
I'll just follow the wet  footprints, okay?
And it's  a wheel of misfortune  - spinning at 500 kilometers an hour.
-   Nightmare is the most  aggressive BattleBot  - in the competition and  -    Around the cones,  people, around the cones!
Wasn't Brandt supposed  to be in this class?
You are, like,  so in love, it's crazy.
Why?
What's on that little mind?
Nothing.
What's on that little mind?
- Stop!
-  Kone, Ishii-Peters!
You see everyone else movin'?
What you doing?
- We are!
- We are.
- Keep it movin', let's go!
-  Sorry.
I was thinking I would  maybe put something  in Brandt's locker today to,  like, remind him of me,  - but is that crazy?
- No, I love that.
So desperate for some water right now.
La la la la la la   La la la   La la la la la la la la la   La la la   Yeah, then go get some!
I could get you some.
Okay, he is like obsessed  with you I'm not kidding.
- This is so crazy.
- Slutty-dutty doo   Slutty-dutty doo doo    Fucking slut.
- Slut?
-  Anna, Maya.
Hey, can I talk to you  guys for a second?
Just people have been talking,  and I thought you should know.
- Okay, Jenna  - Okay, Maya,  I'll get to you in a second.
Anna, at the dance, you were  freaking with everyone.
Uh, Maya, you too!
You were so desperate trying to  get Sam's attention all night.
And then you had a  three-some with Brandt,  and that's fucked up.
-   - What, uh  - a th  - That didn't happen.
Who did you hear that from?
-  Yeah, where did you hear that?
- 'Cause I didn't do that.
I didn't  - Yeah, I didn't do it either.
- We didn't do that.
I mean, it's pretty obvious.
- That's absolutely nasty.
- Actually  crazy, like crazy, crazy, crazy!
- You're crazy.
- Okay, yeah, whatever.
Just thought you should know  that everyone is saying  that you're desperate sluts.
And what makes me really sad  is that you've changed.
Like, a lot.
Didn't happen.
Yeah, Jenna, you don't know  what you're talking about!
I don't like her.
She's crazy.
Do you think I've changed?
Who?
- Do you think I've changed.
- You?
Yeah.
Do you?
I think that we all change all the time  and that that's just normal.
- So you do!
- I don't know how to answer this.
You think I've changed  - like in a bad way.
- I don't know how to answer this!
Mostly good, mostly good!
- Oh, my God.
- No, mostly good.
It's just when we were  at the dance, like  you were, like, grinding with  just a few more people than me,  and like when we were having  the fight, I looked across the gym  and you were, like, three-waying  kind of with Gabe and Jafeer.
But so you're saying I had  two three-ways that night?
Did I have two threesomes that night?
You had two, but I had one.
Like, who am I?
So then I'm more of a slut than you!
That's what you're saying right now!
No, I'm saying if you are,  then I am too 'cause  No, you haven't changed.
You just did one.
- No, I'm just saying that we  - Oh, my God.
I get why people are  saying this about us.
So we're desperate sluts.
Great.
And now everyone knows and  Brandt's gonna be so mad.
He's gonna hate us.
Brandt's a slut too.
Ha.
No, he's just a player.
Oh, yeah.
He's just a player.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1  We haven't spent a lot of time together.
It's just been moments here and there.
Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo   You know, if I'm alone with him,  I can tell him I'm not a slut,  and I'm sorry that people know about us.
I just gotta get him alone.
Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo,  doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo   I mean, obviously, he has trouble  expressing his emotions,  so if I'm alone with him,  he can really open up.
He doesn't like people  knowing his business.
Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo   Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah   Bah bah bah bah bah bah bah bah   Buh, buh, buh, buh,  buh, buh, buh, buh  Buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby   Buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby   Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo, doo, doo, doo   Doo doo doo doo   Doo doo doo doo   Buh buh buh bubby dub dub dub dubby   La-la la la la la-la la la la   La la-la la la   Doo doo doo doo   Doo doo doo doo   If I was around, he'd notice me,  and I think the next stop  would be getting him  to ask me to be his girlfriend,  and then I get my first kiss.
And if I got my first kiss,  then he probably would ask me out.
I'd be his GF.
Ha ha.
Oh, my God.
Maybe we'd  go to the same college.
- We just need time alone.
- Hey, TJ, come out.
But what if he forgets about me?
'Cause we haven't spent  a lot of time together.
It's just been moments here and there.
Mai.
Oh.
Hey.
Na  I think I wanna join wrestling.
What?
What?
Why do you keep looking over there?
I'm not.
You just why you  only wanna join wrestling  - 'cause Brandt's here.
- No, I stop saying his name so loud.
- He's literally right there.
- I just said it like, not at all.
I okay.
Listen to me.
I didn't even know Brandt was in there.
- Okay.
- I promise.
Okay.
You were staring right at him, but  Yeah, 'cause I'm surprised  that I found him there.
I mean, like, honestly, I have  always wanted to wrestle.
- Mai  - What?
Girls wrote "desperate  slut" in my chorus folder.
Listen to me.
I hate girls right now, okay?
I'm over them.
I just like guys, you know?
'Cause guys don't gossip,  they don't talk about stuff  like that, they're not mean.
I just I just feel  like if we go in there,  we can just try it out.
And if you hate it, then we  don't ever have to go back.
Okay?
Just you, me  and ten guys.
That's it.
No.
No, Mai.
No.
Fine!
Fine.
But I have an inner voice inside of me  that sounds a lot like my voice,  and it's telling me to  go in there and wrestle.
And I I can't ignore  it, so I have to go,  and I'd like you to join  or at least watch and be a good friend.
Stay low, Sam.
Lock your hands.
Slam him!
Hey, M Mr. Brown.
I'd like to join wrestling, please.
Mm-hmm.
Like, join the wrestling team and stuff.
Your calves get any bigger,  you're gonna fall through the floor.
Thanks, Coach.
That's not something we do here.
Why, 'cause I'm a girl?
And I'm, like, stronger than  everyone here, probably.
Uh, yeah.
You could get seriously hurt.
Well, um, I think it'd be kind  of messed up and illegal  - if you didn't let me.
- Levels, levels.
- And I could probably report it.
- Okay.
Fine.
You can shadow.
Go stand over there and watch.
Okay.
Thanks, Coach.
When you come in here,  I want you ready to wrestle.
Coach is making me shadow.
- Dude, switch with me.
- Sure.
Whenever Brandt touches his balls,  it means he wants a hand job.
Bro, shut up.
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Shut up.
So stupid.
Reach in and grab all your  rage inside and let it out.
This is the place to do it,  not on your mom, not on your date.
Handle it like a man.
Destroy something privately,  or, better yet, on a team.
Nice!
Drive it!
Drive it!
Drive it!
Drive it!
Drive it!
Nice, Zablowski.
Good job.
- That was dope.
- Thanks.
Sam cock-block so annoying.
Mr. Brown, I'm, like, ready to wrestle.
I've learned a lot from shadowing.
Fine.
TJ, partner up with Maya.
She says she's ready to wrestle.
Coach, I don't want to.
Come on, let's go.
Okay.
Now?
Okay.
Stupid.
- I wasn't ready.
Like, what the hell?
- Coach, can we stop?
I feel weird.
Fine, if he doesn't wanna wrestle,  I'll wrestle anybody else, honestly.
Anybody.
Just raise your hand.
Like, I'm ready to frickin' go.
Brandt, whatever if you want to.
Making her way to the ring,  Trish Stratus!
Why don't you just,  like, talk to him, then?
'Cause I don't wanna be like,  "Hey, I'm Terra Newback.
"Let me just talk to you for a long time  while you're bored as hell, Brandt".
Like I'm not freakin' desperate.
I just want him to know I'm  hanging around and stuff.
Maya, I don't wanna hear  about Brandt anymore.
Okay, well, that's fine  'cause I'm not talking to you.
- I'm talking to Andy.
- Who's that?
You serious?
You've never heard of Trish Stratus?
Trish Stratus.
Her muscles are gross.
Yeah.
No, she's slutty.
- Yeah.
- Yo, Trish is hot.
She's got my mad respect.
Hmm.
Okay.
- Oh, shit!
- Okay, I can do that easily.
- No, you can't, dummy.
- Yes, I can!
Are you frickin' serious?
Look at me.
Maya, no offense, but,  like, this B could take you.
Doubt that.
Okay, that's what TJ Mulligan thought  before I freakin' kicked his ass.
- Did you see that?
- Oh, really?
- Oh, what way am I gonna go, bitch?
- Or, what, bitch?
Come at me, bitch.
Your dad can't eat anything.
Guys, move.
You're blocking the TV.
- He wants to destroy your ass.
- Oh, yeah?
Your dad eats soggy potatoes.
And it makes him fart  on your face, Anna!
You're going down.
Put your money where your mouth is.
I'm putting my butt on your face.
You're cheating.
You cannot do that.
Hey, yo, go, get her, Maya.
- Stop it.
- You're gonna die,  and I'm gonna be alive.
You're so frickin' weak, Maya.
- No!
- Who's weak now, bitch?
I won.
Mom.
The Anna-sthetizer  wants to put you to sleep.
Aah!
Oh, sorry.
But I just it's like that,  we were just wrestling,  and it was like,  "I'm the Anna-ihilator".
- Ooh.
- Anna.
I have a migraine from  doing energy work all day.
Well, I've been wrestling all day.
Like, don't make me flip you.
Could you take that gross  pillow to your dad?
He left it on my side of the house.
Yeah, that's fine,  just bring it to his room.
- And quietly, please.
- Okay.
I can't take it.
Dad?
- Dad?
- Mm-hmm.
Um, do we have channel 151?
'Cause I want my Monday Nights Raw.
- What?
- Raw.
I want my Monday Nights Raw.
I I I think we get,  like, to channel one  hey, what's that pillow doing in here?
Mom just said to bring it to you  because you left it on  her side of the house.
I told her already;  she can take it to the dump.
But you know your mother.
I mean, she does whatever she  wants, whenever she wants.
Don't leave the pillow.
I don't want it.
Okay.
I just never pictured  your mom and I's marriage going  quite this way, you know.
I've never been more in love with  anybody but her my whole life.
Oh, yeah?
Yet you can still end up  sort of hating people anyway.
You know, if I'm the one that  ends up having to move out  even if I can only  afford an apartment  I'm not gonna resent it.
I just want you and  your mom to be happy.
Life can pummel you down, sweetie.
I hope you learn how to pummel back.
Take me now.
The Anna-ihilator!
Get up get up!
Ooh!
Ah!
You want some of this?
'Sup?
You're hot and strong.
You got my mad respect.
So my mom took me to Kinko's  latest installment of Weasels.
Which one do you think is better?
I think glossy really  makes it pop, you know?
Cool.
Hello?
Hey, dude.
I was up until, like, 10:00 doing this.
- Glossy or matte?
- No, either's great.
Okay?
Yo, hey.
- Ha.
- Ha.
What's up, Zablowski?
Hey.
I'll see you later.
Yo, Brandt, wait up!
Glossy it is, then.
Mr. Brown   Mr. Brown   Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown.
I just thought practice yesterday  - was really inspiring.
- Yeah.
Your team is well-oiled,  and I was just honing in my skills  just about all night last night.
And do you wanna see  them?
You don't have to.
But I'll just show you.
- Anna!
- And then you take it down  - to Brown Town.
- Stop.
Well, Maya, I guess you have someone  to fart around with at practice,  so that's something.
Well, um, I would love that,  except I already wrestled her a bunch.
I don't really feel like that's  challenging enough for me.
I was just thinking I could  maybe take on Brandt  at the mock meet on Friday or whatever.
- Well, I already beat her a bunch of times.
- Well  Brandt's the best wrestler in school.
Plus, you're different weight classes.
- So  - Oh, that's okay.
Maya and I can just partner up.
Um  just out of curiosity;  how much weight do I have to gain  to be in Brandt's class?
You'd have to gain at least  6 to 12 pounds in a week,  which is unhealthy at your  age and could mess you up.
So please don't try it.
We won't.
- We won't.
- We won't.
You're doing it for me,  but you're doing it for yourself too.
Clear, Maya, go!
Clear, Maya, go!
Yeah, Mai.
You're bulking.
And you can't stop.
This is what it takes.
It's better with a little bit extra  No, little bitch.
Ha!
Sick.
You guys, I'm slamming down  the mac and cheese.
Can I have a bite of yours?
Um, here's the thing.
If you put peanut butter  on the hard-boiled  egg, that's the trick.
What what trick?
How is that a trick?
That is a trick.
You get "yolked".
That's what, um, Trish Stratus does.
- She's hot.
- Yeah, she is hot.
And muscle weighs more than fat.
Muscle weighs more than fat.
That's what people don't realize.
Anyway, bro.
Coach Brown  got that new mat.
I'm gonna wrestle yo' ass.
So if you're gaining pounds lbs  that's not a bad thing.
- Anyway, I'm gonna go hit the gym.
- That was so funny  when you did that the other day.
You gonna eat all your peaches?
Oh, you don't say "bye" now?
Oh, my God, the protein's  going to her fat-ass head.
I'm just kidding.
Take a picture.
It'll last longer, you guys.
Girls are so annoying, honestly.
Hammer fist!
Nailed him.
It's like I'm stalking you.
Just kidding.
Are you mad at me?
Why'd you join wrestling?
'Cause I love WW.
I have for years, seriously.
I'm, like, sorry people know  about our three-way.
Yeah.
Are you pissed?
Yeah.
Seriously, I'll do anything  I can to make it up to you.
Anything.
Yeah?
Like what?
What?
If you take out the yolk of the egg  you fill it with peanut butter,  it's truly like Reese's Pieces.
- How can you say "no"?
- It tastes like my dog's ass.
- Anna!
- You can't tell the difference.
I was gonna lift a tenner.
Be back soon.
- Anna.
- Okay.
- Come on, stop  - I don't know why  - you keep doing this.
- Stop talking.
You want me to get jacked or not?
Literally, I was this close to  getting my first kiss with Brandt.
How was I supposed to know that?
I didn't know that.
That's amazing, though.
- Congratulations.
- No.
Thank you.
It's fine, it's great.
But it doesn't keep happening  because you keep interrupting.
You keep walking in on us.
Like  Okay, well, I think that  you should learn to use  a lock on a door if you don't  want people to walk in.
Well, honestly, I don't  wanna creep him out.
So I'm just closing the door,  and I'm not locking it,  'cause I'm not crazy.
I know it's not personal,  but every time I'm alone  with him, you walk in.
And, honestly, like, Brandt and I  he doesn't really know it yet,  but, like, we want time alone together.
'Cause if we don't have  time alone together,  then we're not gonna be  able to get to the point  - where I have my first kiss.
- Okay.
It's just like, you're  like, "Brandt "  Shh.
No, you're always like, "Brandt "  Shh!
It's just like, you're  like, "Brandt, Brandt,  - "Brandt, Brandt, Brandt  - Stop.
Okay, okay, okay.
- "Brandt, Brandt, Brandt".
- Stop!
- And I'm like, "I can't do it anymore".
- Stop!
- Brandt!
- Stop it, Anna!
- What?
- You're saying his name so lou  like, you're crazy, honestly.
- Is that your hair?
- No.
- Is that Brandt's locker?
- No.
- Maya.
- Stop saying his name.
So, you and Maya in here, alone, huh?
So that that was like  She keeps following me around, man.
Well, you hooked up with  both her and Kone, right?
Barely.
I mean, I don't wanna get  near their big-ass bushes.
Their pussies smell like fish, dawg.
I mean, these fingers are clean.
Can't get that stank on me.
Big, smelly bush.
Oh, shit.
Anna and Maya are BSBs  big, smelly bushes.
Bro.
Tuna-Kone.
Yo, Zablowski, you're funny, man.
Flyweight.
Middleweight.
Middleweight.
Middleweight.
Jesus Christ, Kone.
Middleweight.
What did you do?
Come on.
Another middleweight.
Really?
Does that mean I get to wrestle Brandt?
You made weight, but  the pairs are set already.
First round is you versus Blondie.
Whoever wins gets to wrestle the  winner of, uh, Brandt and Sam.
Who do you think's gonna win?
I don't even know may  maybe maybe Sam.
- Drive it!
- Maybe.
Use your legs, Sam.
Use your legs.
Nice, Zablowski.
That was good.
That was great.
Get off.
- Stop!
- No.
No.
Let me win, Anna.
- Come on.
- No.
I need to get to Brandt.
Stop.
No.
Oh  I got you.
Lookit  You stay.
You stay!
She's out.
Good match, BSB.
Where's Brandt?
Zablowski beat Brandt.
You ready for this, Bowl Cut?
Don't call me that.
Fold him like a ham sandwich.
Is that all you got, Bowl Cut?
Stop calling me that!
I'm not calling you that.
I'm calling you "Bowl Cut".
Stop it!
- Freakin' asshole!
- Language.
Is that all you got?
Get off.
You're ruining everything right now.
I shouldn't even be wrestling you.
Well, at least I didn't have a three-way  in the closet with Brandt.
Yeah?
You're just jealous  no one would go to the  frickin' closet with you.
Whoo-whoo!
Whatever, BSB.
What?
At least I don't have a big,  hairy bush that smells like fish.
What?
I didn't say that.
Brandt  and the guys said that.
Come on, fight, let's go.
It's it's not a big deal.
It's just a it's just a joke.
- Come on, let's go.
- No, stop!
It's just a joke.
Match?
Here she is, star of the party.
- There's my little athlete.
- Ow.
- You win some, you lose some.
- Ow, stop it.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
- Did I hurt you?
- No.
Mai, sorry.
I just thought that's  what our buddies do.
You ok you okay?
- They're, um  - What?
They're calling us "Big,  Smelly Bush" BSB.
Wait.
What?
Us?
Oh.
Oh, like, what is  what is that?
Like  It's our pussies, Na.
Our pussies.
That's what the guys  have been calling us.
They've been saying that  our vaginas are hairy  and smell like fish.
What?
The guys?
- Yeah.
- No, but they're my friends.
Yeah, well, they aren't anymore.
You can't trust anyone!
Ow!
Anyone but you.
Our pussies!
It's okay.
Weasel-shark.
Half-weasel, half-shark will  kill you and your family.
Yo, Zablowski.
- Yo, what up?
- Yo, Sam.
What happened with Maya  you get a boner?
I said "BSB" to her,  and I probably shouldn't have said that.
Hey, Sam, you coming?
Yeah, I'm coming.
Hold up.
- Ooh, ooh!
- Oh!
Wait.
Did he just leave?
I thought we were gonna hang out.
Let's just go.
Wrestling's kind of gay.
One, two, three.
Oh, my God.
Are you looking?
Yeah.
I don't know.
It's kind of weird.
I can't tell if it's, like, big, but  can you smell anything?
Yeah.
Do you?
I think I smell something,  but it might not be that.
I don't know.
'Cause my  mom's cooking, so  I'm gonna try mixing it with something.
Okay, yeah.
Maybe I have something.
Ow!
- Are you okay, Maya?
- Oh, shit.
I think I burned it.
Be careful with it.
Maybe it doesn't like that.
I only have lip gloss.
It feels like a little animal.
Hmm.
Meow.
Meow!
Meow!
I need a little catnip.
Fly!
Are you still there?
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna go.
Love you, bye.
Bye.
Meow!

- Okay.
-  Siesta time, man.
- Ahh  -  So scary.
-   - BETTY  Most people think dolls  are just toys,  but they're really like  perfect little people.
And it's almost as if the  dollmaker took a person  and shank him down to doll size.

Anna, should I come?
No.
It's okay, you can stay.
No, do you want me  BETTY  Submitted for the approval  - of the Midnight Society  -    Talk to me like you  aren't some jealous dick.
The point I  was trying to make is  you don't bring in a paycheck  by doing "riee-kay," okay?

There you go!
You know,  you're an asshole.
I married   We both know that people  are getting laid off at my job,  - and you said you wanted to help  -  You make me so mad!

You're the one that wanted a divorce.

We agreed that  we didn't want to be together.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We said it was a separation.

There were five leaves  here a second ago.
Now there's only three.

You did that.
No, I didn't do that.
Literally, a leprechaun came in here  I'm not even kidding you  and took two leaves away.
- Maya, stop!
- Anna!
Swear on my life I'm not doing anything.
Have we never talked about  the little green man  that lives in the forest?
Swear!
Look  five twigs one, two,  three, four, five.
He's gonna come by and take it.
- Where is he?
- You have to close your eyes.

Hands are behind my back.
My eyes are closed.

- I heard you move them.
The little pitter-patters?
That was his feet.
That was the green man's feet.
Swear on my life he lives here.
I'm not even kidding.
Is this magic?
Like are we  freaking in magic right now?
- Stop!
- Did you not see the smoke  that came out of my mouth?
I'm a freakin' dragon!
Go again.
- Maya, stop!
- Get away from it.
- It almost caught me.
- It won't touch you.
I have a magic shield  covering your face.
And when I do it,  it doesn't work look.
- I'm sorry, I have that pow  - So your your powers are stronger  - than mine right now.
- It's a natural skill.
Bring me to it.

- Stop, Anna, Anna.
Don't do that without telling me.
I sent too many powers to your ass.
Yeah, but you have to tell me next time.
I know, I didn't want to surge  too much power in your ass.
I could get killed by this tree.
- Seriously seriously.
- No, I know.

Get it Seriously.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Stop, stop, stop!

Why is there fricking paper in the tree?
Paper comes from trees, you nut.
Or, what if it's   What?
- What if it's  - Yeah.
- What if it's  - It's Wendy Rochelle Vicanny.
Wiccany.
Knock, knock, anybody home?
- What?
- It's Mother Witch.
- It's Mother Witch.
- No, I know, but, Anna,  that's a V, not a W.  - Maya, are you out  - That's a  Are you serious?
- Yeah!
- Come on!
In Germany, they pronounce Vs as Ws.
Viccany is an alias   for Wiccany.
She has to just have that  - Oh, my God!
- to protect herself with signs and codes.
- And and things like this  - Yes.
- Like Vs  - And she left this for us to know  that this is all real,  and this is a sign.
Oh, my God.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi, Mother Witch.
With her power and her guidance,  we can ask for all the shite  we want in the world.
- Anything we want!
-   - Oh, my God!
- Aah!
Anna, Anna  - Did you do that?
- Stop I swear I didn't do that!
- I didn't do that.
Did you do that?
- Maya!
No.
- Anna, you did that!
- I didn't oh, my God.
It's Mother Witch.
- She did that.
- Anna, stop, stop, stop.
- Oh, Maya, Maya, Maya.
- So that means she's here  and she wants us to do this.
And she wants us to get  anything that we want.
- Whatever we want.
-  Whatever we want.
- Oh, my God.
-  Oh, my God, stop!
- Oh, my God okay.
-   What do we wish    for?
What do we wish for?
Rah, rah, rah.
What do we wish for?
- Rah, rah, ree.
-  Go, Maya.
- Go, go, Anna, go!
- Go, Maya.
- I wish for blonde hair!
- Go, Maya.
I wish for more money!
I wish for my dad to be home!
I wish I wasn't a problem!
I wish for a bigger  house and no body hair!
Only one at a time.
I wish for white jeans.
And that the closet never  happened with Brandt.
You just said one at a time.
For our omikochan to smell better!
I wish I had my period.
I wish for a group of  friends that love us!
I wish for peace everywhere!
- Wah, wah, wah, wah  -    - Maya.
-    - Mom.
- Hmm?
If you were in Sophie's Choice  and you had to pick one of us to die,  who would you pick, me or Shuji?
- You have to pick.
- I'll pick myself.
No, that's not the point.
You have to pick a kid.
That's like what it is.
Well, she'd obviously pick you to die,  'cause she loves me more.
She's loved me a year longer  because I'm a year older.
Dill hole.
"Dill hole"?
Mom, is that true?
Shuji   Okay, I knew it.
So you do  love Shuji more than me.
You'd pick me to die.
Is that what you'd do?
You'd pick your only daughter to die?
Guys.
It's okay.
I don't really care,  'cause I have powers now, so  I can reverse that easily.
Mom, look at me!
You clearly love Shuji more  if you're not gonna even look at  your own daughter in the face.
Mommy!
Stop!
You guys, stop ignoring me.
- Hello?
-  Hello!
Daddy!
Oh, my God!
Daddy!
-   - They were ignoring me!
Ah, oh, my tour ended early.
You didn't even tell me.
It's noth  - I'll tell ya later.
-  Is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, yeah, everything is fine.
- My powers  - I'll tell you everything  I'm a witch.
-  Everything okay?
-  No, I'm good, I'm good.
Okay.
-   - Can I get it?
Hi, you've reached the Kones'.
This Anna.
Who'd you like to speak to, please?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Anna, it's Maya.
Anna, oh, my God, it worked.
- My dad is home.
-  What?
- Yeah, he just came home.
- Wait, wait, what?
And my hair is more blonde on one side.

I don't like you.
You're ugly.
Stop putting your hair in my locker.
And stop talking to me.
I don't fucking like you.
I know, but it was just pretend.
It's like it's not a big deal.
Your principal said that  Maya was putting her hair  in Brandt's locker,  and you knew about it, and that  doesn't sound like pretend to me.
Was it doll hair, hmm?
What's goin' on with you?
I really don't think this sharing  of the house is working.
I think it's making it worse.
I mean, I know we're  trying to be a family   That's not what we're  talking about.
Hey!
That's   No don't tell me  what we're talking about.
I wanna know what you think.
Tell us what you think.
Um, I think that you guys  should just stay married.
See?
She's confused.
What we're doing, this whole  thing is just too hard on her.
I told you, one of us should  have moved out.
I told you this.
We weren't gonna do that.
But you just slept with him.
- Excuse me?

It's hard for me too!
- Shut up, you idiot.
You should just go away.
Hello?
Maya?
Anna I think that  everyone hates me right now.
Me too.
That's why I found a spell to disappear.
Meet me at our spot, 'kay?
What do you mean, disappear?
Someone's gonna  move out and it's my fault.
We'll do it together.
I'll see you soon.

Well, me, Maya, and Anna  have been best friends  since we were, like, two,  and I think it'd be pretty fucked up  to not vote for what's real.
Mm-hmm.

That's the worst thing  you can call a woman.
I thought it was a type of fool.
Who's teaching you these words?

I'm trying to look at it.
Ready.
I hate it.
But you look so beautiful, Maya.
You look like your mother.
No, I don't  look anything like her.
She's ugly.
Don't say that.
That's really not a nice thing to say.
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.
- Thank you.
And you are very lucky to look like her.
I don't look like her,  and I don't like this dress.

- Maya, stop!
- My meet's in, like, four hours.
- Gina!
Wake up for an hour for my meet.
- I'm sorry!
- Okay, okay, okay.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Everybody shut up.
Listen.
Here's the deal.
Next person who falls asleep is out.
- Not it.
- Not it.
- Not it!
- Not it.
-    - Mm.
She's out.
Sharpie her.
Do it.
Shh.
-   -     What's the farthest you've gone?
Haven't found the lucky lady.
You?
Uh, I just got a handy last summer.
You never told me that.
Burned my dick off.
Lotion, my friend.
Hmm.
Good to know.
- What is going Maya!
-  Sorry!
- What are you doing?
-   What are you my sleeping bag's wet.
What the hell?
Don't be so sensitive.
We're doing it to everyone.
I'm not sensitive.
You're the most sensitive person here.
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
You were leaving me out all night.
You left me in a bag.
Maybe that's why I'm sensitive.
That wasn't on purpose.
Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, my God.
You leave me out all the time.
And you got my bag wet.
Sorry.
That was Maura's idea, not mine.
-  Sorry.
Yeah!
- Oh, was it Maura's idea?
Where is she?
- You literally are obsessed with her.
- Are you kidding?
- Oh, my God, whatever.
- Wow.
Oh, my God, Maura.
-   - She's asleep.
- She's out.
-  She's out.
Maya, shh.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
- She sleeps with her eyes open.
Ew.
- My God.
-    So weird.
Do you love Maura more than me?
Be honest.
Maya.
Obviously not.
She's here.
You're here, but above the heavens.
I mean, for me, she's below the ground  and you're, like, up here.
That's what I'm saying.
Same.
-  Under.
-  Swear?
Swear.
I love you.
- Yeah, let's go to bed.
-  In your bag?
Yeah.
Are you sure are you  sure you don't mind?
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Hey, Anna.
Yeah?
The last ones out, aren't we?
Yeah.
Do you want me to rub your back?
No, it tickles.
Oh, my back, okay, yeah.
Can you do the long scratches?
You guys!
Wake up!
Oh, my God.
Somebody clogged the toilet  and it's brand-new and super expensive.
What?
Somebody clogged the toilet  and it's brand-new and super expensive.
- Who was it?
-  God.
She's right.
There's a weird pad in there,  - so whoever left it has their period.
- Not it.
- Not it.
- Not it.
Not it.
Definitely not it.
I bet it's Maya.
What?
I mean, you did go in there last.
It wasn't Maya 'cause we  don't have our periods yet.
Yeah.
We don't.
I mean, Maya, if it was  you, it's totally fine.
We just need to know so we can fix it.
Okay, but it's not me  'cause I don't have it,  but what if it was like, Santa came  and, like, literally bled on a pad  and, like, put it in the toilet.
Nah, I'm pretty sure it was you.
I don't have my period!
Stop.
- It obviously was though!
-  Oh, my God.
Maura, you're being crazy actually.
- Stop.
- You guys, she wants her privacy.
Guys, stop.
You're being crazy!
Stop!
Uh, Maura?
Your foot's bleeding.
What?
-   - Wait, what?
- Oh, my God!
-  Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
Ew!
-   -  Ew!
Is that what you do for a pad?
That's disgusting!
Oh, my God, what is that?
-   - Stop.
-   - That's disgusting!
Stop!
Okay, you guys are being really mean!
Stop!
It's my blood!
Stop it!
What?
My blood.
Fucking knew it.
Why would you lie to Anna?
- That's so fucked up.
- I'm not.
Come here.
- It's gonna be okay, Anna.
-  It's okay.
Anna, I'm sorry.
I didn't    I'm so sorry.
That's so fucked up.
We're here for you.
- We're your friends.
-  We love you, Anna.
-   -  Hello?
Hey, Mom.
Maya?
Yeah, I'm sorry for calling so late.
What what's wrong?
Nothing.
Can you just come pick me up?
Please?
What's going on?
Nothing.
I just wanna come home.
Everyone thinks I'm a liar.
No, you're not a liar.
You know, privacy's  different than secret.
No, I know,  but Anna asked and I lied to her  and I feel like  I don't know, I, like,  clogged Maura's toilet  and everyone thinks I'm disgusting now.
Oh, you listen to me, Maya.
Girls or women are like salad bowls.
You know?
You put everything in one bowl.
Um, like this one here?
This is your      What?
It's not funny.
It's it's beautiful.
-  No, I hate it.
- It's a little cute wonder.
And ooh, who's that?
What's in here?
Ooh, this is Anna.
You cherish it and keep it.
And you only get to keep  what's most important to you.
Okay?
Because there's not  much room in the salad bowl.
Okay?
What's that?
- Taking things off.
-  Ah.
You have a lot of junk  in your bowl, huh?
Oh, what's that?
- Anna.
-  Anna?
Ooh, it's nice.
- Okay.
- Stop taking it off my head.
-  You wanna keep it there?
- Yeah.
-  You wanna keep Anna?
- Yeah.
Ah, that's good.
Even if she hates me.
I'm sure she doesn't.
She will come back.
Okay.
Yeah.
So let's just cherish it.
Let's keep it.
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm?
You're gonna be okay.
- Okay.
- All right?
Hmm?
Um, sorry, but I just can I have $20?
'Cause, um, Bernard spent  it all on alcohol again.
Again?
What a cunt.
Thanks.
It's kinda weird that  Maya's not here, no?
I mean, like, it'd be  weirder if she was here.
Like, I don't know how  you forgive someone  after lying to you like that.
Yeah.
Maya moved to Arizona.
Mm.
Yeah.
Bernard.
Bernard.
You just always lie to me.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
You want milk, baby?
Milk.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Tonia.
Hey.
- Hey.
You got your milk?
-  Yeah.
Uh, can I have my wallet back now?
Oh, yeah.
Thanks.
I just borrowed the   Yeah.
Your baby needs you.
-  Shh.
- Mm-hmm.
Mom.
Mom, could you, like, come up here?
Maura  You said that she was, like, a doctor.
But she's in a body spray ad.
Um, can I just have this back?
Well, I'm just using it.
- Anna.
- What?
- Right?
I mean, you lied.
- Can I just  - You can just say it.
- Can I just  can I just give it back please.
- No.
- Anna.
It's mine.
Mom!
Mommy?
Anna.
-  Anna, it's mine.
-  No.
-  It's mine!
- No.
- Give it back.
- No, you give it back!
No.
Mom!
Hey, it's mine.
-  I'm just gonna just let me  -  Stop.
-  Stop.
-  Give it back!
- Maura.
-  It's mine!
- Come on!
It's mine!
-  Maura, no.
-  It's mine!
Anna!
-  No, no, no!
-  Anna!
- Just go.
- Just  -  No!
Mom!
- Mom, no!
-  Shh.
It's okay.
Calm down.
No!
Anna!
Give it Anna!
No, Mom, it's mine!
- Come on.
- Mom, no!
-  Sweetheart, calm.
-  Mom.
Just calm.
- Calm.
Just breathe.
-  Anna!
That's why I said four  about her, on the phone.
I knew she was not right.
You always know before me.
Like, I'm too trusting.
- I'm too trusting.
-  My mom knew too.
-  And Gina.
- I know.
None of them are her real friends.
I knew it.
I freaking knew it!
No.
Duh.
She's a liar.
No, I know, but I am too.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you  about my period, but    I guess you don't like  me either right now.
Honestly, it's something about me.
Like, I just attract liars.
Something that says,  like, you can't trust me.
Anna, it's not always about you.
It's my freaking period!
Like, it was a big  deal and I was like  I thought it was small  and it would go away,  but it, like it didn't.
Just comes once a month.
No, you're right.
That's really intense.
- It is.
- I'm sorry,  and I'm really so happy for you.
My best friend's a woman.
No, I don't wanna be.
Why?
I don't know, I guess I'm  just, like, a salad bowl  like every other woman.
Mm.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Like mushy carrots, you know?
Just promise no more secrets.
- Never.
- Okay?
- I swear.
-  Swear.
- Swear.
- Swear.
Except I did throw away  one of your library books  'cause I spilled Sprite on it.
Maya, that could affect my credit.
I know.
Sorry.
And also, when you're not around,  I go through your underwear drawer  and try on every pair  with flowers on them.
Over or under yours?
- Under.
-   Also, I drew that goatee on your face  and there's still a little bit on there.
- You did that?
- Yeah.
I also joined wrestling  because of Brandt,  not 'cause I wanted to  be a strong wrestler.
Also when my mom buys potatoes,  I put them in my shirt  and I walk around like this with boobs.
Also I have a book of crushes  and one of them is your dad.
- Ew, Maya!
- I just  Also I sometimes touch myself down there  in a way that I told you about,  but in a different way, not for comfort.
I have a secret screen name  where I talk to old men,  and I'm talking to one right now.
I also shave my mustache sometimes.
- Shuji's my half brother.
-  What?
But we're basically full.
That's probably it.
I got a pencil mark on  your bed cover once.
It was about this big,  and I didn't tell you.
- Anna!
- That has been killing me.
Why would you do that and not tell me?
I feel so much better.
Ugh, that's, like, kind of annoying.

1  Hey, get out of the way!
- Oh, my God, wait.
- Ow!
You're stepping on my toe.
Jesus.
Let me see!
Yeah, I mean, you don't really know  Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
I got it, I got it, I got it.
Congratulations!
That's amazing.
- I think you go it.
- Oh, my God!
Yes!
- I think you got it.
- You do?
- I do, I do, I do.
- Sorry, you guys.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Wait.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- That is not real.
- That's not real.
That's not real.
- That's the lead.
Oh, my God!
- Wait.
- That is incredible.
- Wait.
- Is there another list, though?
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, no, I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.
- No, no.
It's so fucked up you didn't  get a role and I did.
- No, it's fine.
- No, it doesn't make sense.
You're literally the best  actress in our school.
Like, you're so much better than me.
I don't want to do it without you.
Oh, my God, Maya!
Hi.
Oh, my God.
- Thank you.
- I know!
It's amazing.
You're gonna be so good.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.
- You're gonna be so good!
- No, no.
No, you guys.
You don't even know.
I've,  like, never done this before.
- I've never acted.
- You're gonna be so good.
Stop saying that!
- I'm not going in.
No, I'm not.
- You're incredible.
- I'm not.
I suck.
I quit.
I'm not going in.
- You have to go in, Maya.
No, please.
I want you to go in.
- You're better than me.
- First rehearsal!
I know!
I'm so excited.
No, I can't do it.
Please.
Just come in for a little.
- I don't know.
No, it's embarrassing.
- Please, please, please!
- No, I can't go in.
Please.
- Maya.
- Please.
Please.
- Maya.
Maya.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- You want some milk?
- Yeah.
All right.
Shh.
Latch.
Maya, latch, latch.
That's better.
Maya, no.
No.
Ma ow!
Maya!
- Ow!
- Maya?
- Yeah.
- Are you coming in now?
- We're about to start.
- Yeah.
- Hello.
I'm sorry, who are you?
- Anna.
- Anna.
- I just wanted to say that  - I know that you "cast" your play already  - Uh-huh.
But if you have an  understudy role, I'm free.
She's actually, like,  a really good singer  and actor and stuff.
She had this "Ave Maria" solo  a while back that was really good.
- Here, sing it.
- Ave   Maria   It's whatever.
Wow.
You have a really great range.
But we're about to have our  first rehearsal now, Maya,  so we're ready whenever you are.
Great to meet you.
Keep keep going.
- You're really some great.
- Sure thing.
Thank you.
- Okay.
- Okay.
So it's just you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
No.
Have an amazing time.
- You got it.
You got it.
- No, I don't want to go without you.
- I love you.
- You've got it.
I love you.
So, here we are.
Congratulations.
I'll give  you a little backstory.
The play is an original piece,  which means I wrote it.
And for you guys as the actors,  my whole thing, my mantra,  it's gonna be real and honest.
If you're not real and honest with me,  if you're not real and  honest with yourselves,  and if you're not real and  honest with each other,  then this whole thing is bullshit.
Now, there are four of  you in this ensemble  and by the end of this rehearsal,  there will be three.
So who here doesn't belong?
Come on.
Ian, who doesn't belong?
Um, I'm, um  - Come on.
- Sorry, it's just hard.
- Real and honest.
- Um, I think I would pick  Maya.
It's just, in every drama  class since third grade,  you haven't, um, showed  anything that I've noticed.
I don't think you have,  like, "it" charisma.
You're just kind of wild  and out of control.
Thank you, Ian.
Well  That was just an exercise.
Relax.
You guys all belong.
Relax.
You're here.
You're in.
Good.
Very real, very honest.
Now we can start.
Good job, guys.
Really good job.
Relax.
Take a deep breath.
How'd you guys feel?
Trailview Middle School's  performing arts showcase.
Ave   Ave dominus   Dominus tecum   Benedicta tu   In mulieribus   Et benedi   Oh, my God.
Hey, Anna.
Hey.
Want some duct tape?
What?
We're making wallets.
- Oh.
- Here.
Oh.
Ow.
What are you guys doing here?
We're techies.
I'm the lighting designer.
Marissa's props.
Sorry, babe.
Master of props.
We handle all the technical  elements of the play  and build sets.
Wow.
Talented couple.
Do you have, like, a  teacher or anything?
- Supervisors?
- Kind of.
Steve's a freshman and he's  supposed to supervise us,  but lets us do whatever till tech week.
You mean Hell Week, peasants.
'Sup, Steve?
- You two watch Final Destination yet?
- It's on my list.
Horror's an easy genre to fuck up.
Watch it, Kone?
Is it James Wong's sonata?
Obliviously not, but you should watch it  if you think films are worth watching.
Okay, people.
Very exciting moment.
Getting our official show scripts.
You only get one of these,  so take very good care of it.
Go ahead.
Highlight your character's  parts and your dialogue.
There are four highlighters there.
Wow, Maya.
You get to highlight a lot.
Whoa.
Maya and Gabe kiss.
Okay, Jessica.
No, Jessica's right.
There is a kiss in the first scene.
Which we are gonna have to make  as real and honest as possible.
Anybody have any questions yet?
-   - Does this train go   To paradise?
Do you want to give it a rest?
- I'm trying to read.
- I'm just prepping  in case the judge decides  that I don't get the house.
-   - Okay?
Anna, look.
I found your old Nintendo.
That's a broken Game Boy.
We're trying to read.
I'm the one that should  be worried, all right?
It's not like that female judge  is gonna rule in my favor.
All the more reason to help me.
Anna, look!
Your "most improved" trophy.
- Keep it?
- No.
I don't know why I'd need that, so  How 'bout your glitter?
Keep that?
- You still love crafts, don't you?
- Mom!
I don't want any of that stuff.
Like, I don't do that anymore.
Glitter's for kids, Kat.
You keep talking to us  while we're reading.
Like, stop.
Does this train go?
This train go?
Sheila was backing away from you.
Sheila was backing away from you.
Don't you dare make another drink.
Don't you dare!
I'm warning you, don't do it.
Were you doing your  business with Sheila?
Were you doing your business?
Were you were  Were you doing your business  with Sheila, you rat bastard?
You rat bastard!
Were you doing it with  Sheila, you rat bastard?
Get away from me!
Yeah.
You get your hands off me, you pig.
You know, I could call you Mommy  and you wouldn't know the difference.
Mommy.
Mommy.
Mommy, get me water.
Get me turnips.
Yeah.
You're not a man.
You know, a real man,  he grabs a woman,  he takes her by the neck, and says,  "Everything's gonna be all right".
Oh, what?
What, you gonna hit me?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You don't even know what it takes  to put your flesh  against someone else's.
You just sit.
That's all you do.
You sit, you sit, and you sit,  and you wait for someone to come by  and tell you what to do.
Well, you know what?
I ain't gonna do it no more.
I'm not gonna sit.
I'm not gonna wait around for anything.
I'm gonna swim!
I'm gonna fly!
I'm gonna be the best goddamn person  that ever fucking existed!
You hear me?
I'm it, baby.
I am it!
A real man grabs a woman  grabs a woman by the neck  and ya hear  it takes flesh  takes flesh to g  Against someone's.
Sorry.
Can I start again?
Mm-hmm.
Um  it's the flesh that takes  against someone else's  what it feels against someone else's.
If it  When you feel the flesh against  Sorry.
Gabe, can you, like, stop  eating your sandwich right now?
'Cause you're taking  me out of the scene.
- I'm, like, trying to  - This is good.
See, if you were really in the scene,  then you wouldn't have been  distracted by Gabe's eating.
- You see that?
- Yeah, I agree.
I feel like I was in the scene  and I was, like, really  Imagine you're in a theater  of 300 people, okay?
- Uh-huh?
- Do you think they're all  just gonna sit quietly and watch?
People are gonna get up  to go to the bathroom,  they're gonna be  whispering to each other,  they're gonna be coughing,  there's papers are gonna be  crinkling all over the place,  but you can't stop.
You gotta keep going.
I promise you, like,  I did this last night.
- I was really good.
- If you're in the moment,  then you're not distracted with  what's going on around you.
I was in the moment 'cause  that's happening in the moment.
Right, where you were in that moment.
- Yeah.
- Not that one.
- Right.
- So  Okay.
I'm telling you, one screw, man.
- Two.
- Babe, listen to her.
She's a carpenter.
Freaking hot.
Is the air on?
No, they only put it on during Hell Week  for the actors.
You guys know I can make  myself cold on demand?
It's 85 degrees in here  and I'm fucking freezing.
Steve, you've gotta show  me how you do that.
Yeah, but like I was  saying, one screw  Here.
You'll need this.
- Two.
- What's two gonna do?
Oh, I'm not really sure I'm gonna stay  'cause I don't know  if I'm really, like, built  for this kind of thing.
"Adapt what is useful,  "reject what is useless,  and add what is specifically your own".
Bruce Lee.
Hmm.
- Okay.
- Build yourself to build a set.
Cool.
You don't know what it takes.
I don't even know.
Ya hear  - Okay.
- Sorry.
It's all right.
We're gonna  try something different.
Put the script down.
Script down.
Plant your feet.
Bend your knees.
Slight bend so you can  have a little bounce.
Now shake it out.
Ha, ha, ha.
That's stupid.
Shake it.
Be stupid.
Let those hands go.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Good.
Now what are you scared about?
What?
What are you scared about?
- Nothing.
- What are you scared about?
- Nothing.
- What are you scared about?
- Nothing.
- What are you scared about?
- Nothing.
- What are you scared about?
- Dying.
- What are you scared about?
My dad!
Good.
Gabe, now.
Take it from the end of that scene.
Don't worry about the lines.
You gonna hit me?
- You gonna hit me?
- Yeah.
All right, come and hit me.
Hit me real good, right in the jaw.
You shut your goddamn face  or I'll give you a real shiner!
Yeah, you think you're tough?
Come at me, baby!
I'm ready.
I'm ready to feel something.
I haven't felt something in years.
You say one more word, I swear  Yeah, you swear what?
You gonna cry home to your mommy?
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
- You shut your mouth.
- Yeah, or what?
No clapping during rehearsal.
Maya, Gabe  there it is.
That was it!
There it is!
Wow, Maya, I was wrong.
You have "it".
I don't even know what happened.
I was, like I, like, blacked out.
That was so weird.
I felt like, I spit on you.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no.
I loved that.
Like, I didn't even feel it.
It made me so angry, like  Like, in the scene, yeah.
I know.
I'm, like look.
I'm literally shaking right now.
Oh, my God, me too.
Look.
Let's take ten.
After the break, we're gonna  get into the kissing scene  because I think we're ready.
Just be honest and honesty will follow.
Ooh!
Shut up, dude.
Yeah, stop.
Spielberg used two screws  in every beam in Jaws.
- Look it up.
- No, one screw.
You put in two screws and  you risk splintering it.
Two screws ensure it doesn't break.
- It could  - Sorry.
Oh, no, keep going.
- Be right back.
Whoopsie-daisy.
- If we put two screws  and we break it, it's all  gonna be your fault.
- It won't break.
- Yes, it will.
No, it won't!
Hey, sorry.
Um, I was just thinking that,  like, maybe they could  just stop arguing.
It would be a little bit more efficient  if they just tried, like, the two screws  'cause I already finished,  like, six beams  and we can't really move  on till that one's done.
So maybe you could just  say something or  Why don't you say it to them?
Okay, sorry.
We're not gonna get in trouble  - if we just do it my way.
- Yeah.
And you know what?
If it doesn't work,  we can just put in two screws.
Fine, but I already know  it's going to work  - with one screw.
- Hey, so  - It won't work.
- Sorry for interrupting.
Not to be bossy, but  I was just gonna say,  like, what's the point  of all the talking?
We're trying to build  this beam correctly.
Right.
But I'm just saying, like, Hell  Week's coming up, and, um  Look, why won't you  guys just listen to me?
- Trust me, okay?
- There's a bunch of  stuff that has to get done.
We have to do it quickly  and, like, I think you  should just make a decision  and if you make a decision,  then we can just get it done  and move on, and if you don't,  then you're just wasting your own time.
I'm sorry.
It's just a thought I was having  and I just wanted to share it,  but it's probably stupid.
Guys, I think she's right.
I know.
I just wanted to  "Knowing is not enough.
"We must apply.
"Willing is not enough.
We must do".
Bruce.
Okay, Obi-Wan Kone-obi.
What do we do next?
Your scene work with Maya  was really inspiring.
Oh, uh, thanks.
Yo, Gabe!
Heard you guys had a crazy sleepover.
What a ridic  like you weren't doing the  same thing?
Come on.
At least I wasn't  tag-teaming like you homos.
Okay.
Yeah, well, this homo gets to kiss Maya,  so who's the homo now, faggots?
Well, yeah, you know it's  not a real kiss, though.
'Cause it's in a play.
Yeah, well, she's hot,  so I don't care if it's real or not.
Okay.
Okay.
- Later.
- Later.
Half beam, go.
Faster.
Go.
Yes.
Move.
Sorry to say that.
Bring it in.
Faster.
Yes.
Yes, you guys.
Yes.
Support.
Support is my middle name.
Oh, my God.
We're good.
All right, gang.
Welcome back.
So let's take it from the  end of the first scene  at the line, "Get away".
Get away from me.
Isn't this what you want?
You don't know the first  thing about what I want.
You get your hands off me, you pig!
Oh!
Or what?
Uh, sorry, uh hold.
Um, Greg, uh, can I have  a little aside with Maya?
- Whatever you need.
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.
Was it my breath?
Oh, uh, no.
It's just, um  like, I just wanted to  make this official,  you know, before we uh  do it, so, like  um  Do you want to be my girlfriend?
- You don't have to answer now.
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Sick.
- Oh, my God.
- So, like, in rehearsal  - Yeah.
Whenever we kiss, um  in rehearsal, whenever we kiss,  it's gonna be, like, Joe  and Debra, you know?
- Yeah.
- And I want to kiss as Gabe and Maya.
That's literally the most romantic  thing I've ever heard.
Okay.
So let's save it then.
Let's save our first kiss.
Okay.
So when?
For, uh, let's first date.
We'll do it on our first date.
So when?
The last night of Hell Week.

Oh, you'll see.
Oh, my God, they heard us.
They heard us.
Guys, are we ready yet?
- Sorry, yeah.
Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Like, just, like, the shading here  and then it kind of has,  like, a vibe with it.
The kind of feel of the night.
Going into Hell Week, gang.
It's gonna be intense.
Sure, a play needs actors  and writing, blah, blah.
Actors suck!
But it really is about  the behind the scenes  that makes it all happen.
And Kone, you fucking led us there.
I'm making you stage manager.
Oh, my God.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hmm.
Oh.
You looking for these?
It's 4:00.
Actors are called at 4:10.
Oh.
Let's go.
Yeah, that's on me, guys.
I got the time all messed up.
You're in the driver's seat, Kone.
- Here's what's gonna happen.
- Okay.
The actors are gonna  be so fucking excited  to step onto stage,  they're gonna walk around barefoot,  but there are nails, there is sawdust,  this is not a playground.
You own the space.
- Don't let them  - Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so big!
This is crazy!
- Cool.
- This is, like, so big.
Oh, my God   Gonna be awesome   Gonna sell out   Hey!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Ha!
Okay.
Places for the  it's not it's not, uh  In the spotlight   - Everybody sees me   - Turn it up.
Everybody say hey   Places for the top of act one.
Please?
- Hey, Anna.
- Hey, Maya.
Please, can you do that?
And put your shoes on.
We usually rehearse  without shoes, but  And then we'll do places  for the top of act one.
Okay.
- Guys.
- Shoes are over there.
- Our shoes are over there   - Oh, God.
We have our shoes over here.
- I they're not back here.
- Oh, my God.
Tech week, people.
Take it from the top.
I saw you!
I saw you with my own two eyes!
Hold.
Yeah, stay right there.
Hold.
I didn't even finish my line.
'Kay, it's more important  that we mark this cue.
It's a lighting thing.
You wouldn't understand.
Okay, we got it.
Act.
You  - Oh, is it your line?
- Yeah.
I saw you with my own  - Hold.
- Oh, my God.
Why do you keep going like this?
If you're not gonna do that on the day,  don't do that, okay?
- Seriously?
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.
- Okay, we got it.
Act.
For ten years, you've told me  Hold.
You're not in your light.
Still not in your light.
I'd rather go to jail  - Mai, that's you.
- Line.
"I'd rather go to jail  than spend one more minute with you".
I have it.
Thank you.
To your left.
Your left.
- The other left.
- Anna, let me finish the line.
Hold.
Go 132.
Hold.
Hold, I said.
Hold.
Hold!
- Hold.
- We're just getting up.
Hold.
Walk it through slowly  so we can get the marks.
Saw you with my own two eyes.
Slower physical.
Rat bastard.
Faster vocal.
I saw you backing away from Sheila.
Sheila was a rat bastard.
Sheila was a rat bastard.
I saw  you backing away from Sheila.
What are you gonna do, Debra?
You gonna divorce me?
I don't even know what  we're doing anymore.
- I'm really confused.
- Can you do it full-out?
I don't wanna do it full-out right now.
I don't want to go at 100.
I'm gonna go at  If you are doing something different  than what you're doing on the day,  - we're not gonna know our cue.
- Oh, my God.
- Please let us do our work.
- Uh, can you say it again?
You keep forgetting your lines.
Okay, sorry!
- Find your light.
- Is that it?
- Colder.
- Is that it?
- Colder.
- Is that it?
- Ice cold.
- Is that it?
- Oh, my God.
- Is that fucking it?
- Line?
- Damn it, Maya!
I cannot act when you're  yelling technical cues.
I cannot do it.
I don't know where the light is!
Whose fucking beeper is that?
Did I find it?
This is our time in the tech world  to make sure that you  guys don't mess it up.
- No offense.
- I can't feel it.
- Feel the warmth!
- Give us space  - to breathe and say our lines!
- Take a take a  If I can't say the lines,  then I can't act!
I-I can't  we're fucked.
So it's really simple.
I'm in my light.
Not in my light.
I'm in my light.
Not in my light.
Can I just interject?
- Yeah.
- It's called warmth.
You feel the warmth  when you're in the light.
Can I interject on his interjection?
I'm not feeling warmth.
Like, when I stand in the lights,  I don't know about you guys,  I don't feel it on my skin or anything.
These are grade A lights.
Okay, we don't have a lot of time,  so props.
You guys need to put your props  back down on the props table.
I cannot emphasize it enough.
Sorry, but every time Marissa  places my prop on stage left,  it's actually meant to be on  stage right where I exit.
Actually, you're using the  bottle at the top of act two  when you should be using the broom.
Okay, you guys, we don't have  time to talk about this.
So basically, the thing is,  is you just put your prop  back on the prop table.
Maya, got a note for you.
You gotta remember your lines.
That's the only way  that we know our cues  and you need to memorize them.
I did memorize them.
If we had enough time to go  over them, I'd be able  Maya, we can't do the work for you.
I'm not asking you to  do the work for me.
I was doing the work.
'Cause you guys are doing tech  and we're, like, doing art, so  'Kay, tech is art, so  Fuck the semantics.
Just fucking remember your lines!
All right, all right, okay.
Very good.
Was that a cough, Gabe?
Oh.
Yeah, it's I'm fine, though.
All right.
Everybody freeze.
We're done.
I am not gonna have my  actors get sick, okay?
Gabe, I'm not messing around, okay?
Go home, steam your sinuses,  and you gargle three times  with salt water, okay?
Everybody else, techies included,  go home, get some sleep,  at least eight hours,  and please, please wash your hands!
Thank you.
- I'm still Okay.
Memorize  - We're done.
- Good night.
- And memorize your lines.
Thank you, Anna.
I'm sorry I'm yelling.
Are we still on for our  date tonight or no?
I mean, I might be sick.
Okay, well, I can take care of you.
Sick boy.
See you tonight, boyfriend.
Yeah.
That's me.
Actually, that's the cue 32.
Like, I'm just so fucking hell.
I can't handle these actors.
Like, I can't.
We didn't even have a dress rehearsal  - 'cause they're so fucking incompetent!
- Shh.
Sorry.
I was sweating bullets 2.6 seconds ago.
Look at me now.
Mm-hmm.
This play's a pile of dog shit.
But you can change it with your mind.
You get me?
Okay.
My one and only   Gabe, you girlfriend's here.
And she's so cute,  I won't even leave the door open.
Mom.
Hi, boyfriend.
Hi.
I brought masks and soup.
I don't think I'm sick.
Well, just in case.
I love this song.
It's my favorite.
Me too.
Oh, my God.
Rehearsal was, like, complete shitake.
- Literally.
- Literally?
So it was a mushroom?
Yeah.
What?
Do you want me to feed you the soup?
Nah, I'm good.
Okay.
It's only a tiny space   That keeps us apart   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
But never lonely   - Hold on.
- Sorry.
I just, uh  You are always here   Sorry.
I just, uh, didn't want you  to get sick, you know?
Here we go.
- 'Kay.
- Get a good hold on it.
- Good?
- Yeah.
I don't want you to get sick either.
Someday   Care to dance?
When I'm awfully low   When the world is cold   I will feel a glow   Just thinking of you   And the way you look tonight   Oh, but you're lovely   With your smile so warm   And your cheek so soft   There is nothing for me   But to love you   Just the way you look   Tonight   With each word   Your tenderness grows   Tearing my fear apart   And that laugh   It feels like  there's a bunch of butterflies  fluttering around in my chest.
Touches   My foolish heart   Yeah.
Can we do a real kiss now,  without the masks on?
Um l-let's wait until opening night  to do our first kiss.
But I thought you said  not to do the kiss  as our characters, but as Gabe and Maya?
Well, it's too late, you know?
We we already are our characters.
We are Joe and Debra, Maya,  so when we kiss, it'll still be us.
Just the way you look   Tonight   That's romantic.
Okay.
So tomorrow?
Opening night.
Just the way you look   Toni
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1    Day of the show!
Are you excited?
Um, yeah, I guess I will be  if it's not a total disaster  'cause nobody's prepped,  especially Maya, so  you know what, though?
I don't want to talk about it,  'cause it's stressing me out.
- Dad, we're late!
-  Wait, Munch.
-  Yeah!

422.
Congratulations.
Find your light.
The light will find me, Anna.
Like, seriously.
Honestly, all you have to do right  now is just, like, pep me up.
Like, pep me up.
Just say, like, "Break a leg".
Whatever.
What you haven't  said that once to me.
- Your feelings are valid.
-  Mm-hmm.
- So are mine.
-  Mm-hmm.
And you can't take  constructive criticism.
- That's my feeling.
- Are you kidding?
- And good luck.
-  Okay, you just jinxed me.
It's "break a leg," so now  I'm gonna be really bad  in the play, but it's fine.
Let's just hold each other's  hand and say, "I'm sorry".
I'm not ready right now.
Well, I'm not really  ready for it either.
I was honestly just saying it  'cause I thought it was  the right thing to do.
- So  - Wow.
- Places in 4 minutes, 15 seconds.
- Okay.
Psycho.
Yep.
Hey.
Hi.
Are you still feeling sick?
No, I'm just, uh, concentrating.
'Kay, well, I'm really looking forward  to 4 minutes and 32  seconds into the play.
It's our kiss.
Oh   Yeah.

Sheila was backing away from you.
She was scared out of her mind.
She's not in her light.

Honey, help me with this, will you?
It's giving me a rash.
A rash, a rash.
Always something with you.
Bryce, are you there?
-  Be careful with it.
- Go to two.
- Go to two.
-  Careful with it, I said.
- Jesus Christ!
- All right, relax, will you?
You're wriggling around like a worm,  and you're hairier than a bigfoot.
Your fingers are greasy  schlubs, that's why.
Forget it, will you?
I said just get it off!
- Jesus Christ.
-  All right.
Jesus Christ,  I said.
Jesus Christ.
- Cue 30.
-  What do you want?
- Want me to stay?
-  Cue 30.
Want me to go?
Make up your mind, woman!
Make up your mind.
No, that's cue 22.
Yeah.
Too damn dark in this joint.
Don't you dare make another drink.
I'm telling you, don't you do it!
Or what, Debra?
You gonna divorce me?
You gonna feed me to the wolves?
I don't have to listen to  your loud-mouth crap.

- and he went No, and he went like that.
Maybe his hand slipped.
No, but then when we were onstage,  we were planning to do a real kiss,  and he put his hand over his  mouth, like, at the last second.
- It's okay.
Hey, I'm sorry sorry.
- Stop, we're in here!
Just two more seconds.
Is it my breath?
It's good.
- No, no, really  - Oh, my God!
No, no, no, no.
No, it's good.
And do you know  can I ask you a question?
Were you nervous out  there, for your kiss?
I mean, yeah, 'cause it's,  like, in front of everyone,  and like, it's my first kiss.
So he was probably nervous too.
I think that you just gotta do it again,  and you gotta go for what you want,  and it's gonna happen.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, all right.
Fine.
I'm just gonna  I see how he looks at you.
- Stop.
- It's true.

Okay, but be quiet.
I don't want to be obvious about it.
Okay, just like, literally  don't look, and like, if  Hey.
Oh, my God, my dad's here.

Thanks.
And  I I also wanted to  say, like, you know,  once and for all or  whatever, that, uh  never mind.

I don't know.
- Why?
- No reason.
Nothing.
- Why?
Did he say something?
- No.
Um, but I mean, you know,  I wouldn't have put my  hand over my mouth.

-  Yeah.
- Or not.
I don't know.

Anna made such an impact  as the stage manager,  - and there was point whe  - Yeah, that's great.
Hey.
Did, uh, Kathy give  you the flowers that we got you?

- Absolutely.
They're so pretty.
Where  did you guys get them?
Uh, where did we get the flowers, Kathy?
I got them from Stop and Shop.

You know, there are much  better places to get flowers  than Stop and Shop.
Right?
Hey, did your mom clap,  or did she do that weird  yodeling thing that she does?
She did the weird yodel thing.
- It was so embarrassing.
-     Honestly.

Uh, the convertible?

Does your dad know  that he can get the upgrade  to the sports package?
These are pretty sweet, though.
He's got the JBL stereo.
Yeah.
So many stars.
Yeah.
They're all dead.
I think that we need to,  like, leave them alone.
-  Stop.
- You guys need to get a room.
Anna!
- Don't get my dad's seats dirty.
- That's disgusting.
Or do, and just wipe it down after.
It's Model 3B high-perforated leather.

Should we go up?
- Um sure.
- 'Kay..
So did your parents see the show?
Mom did.
She, uh she loved the  glitter thing, by the way.
I told her that wasn't me.
That was all Kone.
"Cameron-esque" was my exact phrase.
As in, James.
Yeah.
Um, are you close with your mom?
She's the strongest woman I know.
And your dad?
He doesn't live here.
They're divorced.
Mine are too.
- But your dad's here?
-  Yeah.
They're divorcing, but they  kind of share the house.
Sounds worse than the  "every other weekend" deal.
- Oh, yeah.
-  Yeah.
I don't know.
- It's weird.
-    Want some?
Um  Yeah, like, I just have to check  if Maya might want some too.

For her.
For Maya.

It's no big deal.
Oh, my God.

- Yeah,  that's how you know it's the good stuff.
Oh, my God.
Am I gonna get drunk?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

I said, it's the cops, bitch!
You're funny.
No, I'm not.
You are.
Are you mad at me?

Do you wanna, like, kiss me now?
Someone could see.
Um  We can just put the seats down.

Um  Uh  - What?

You know how  when we sort of kissed in my room,  you said that you had butterflies?
Yeah.

I still think that you're  one of the best actors  I've ever known, and  it was an honor to share  the stage with you.

It's not you.
I'm just trying to be honest.
I'm gonna I'm gonna go inside.

Was the kiss bad?
No.

He's such an idiot.
My heart hurts, like  I can feel your heart energy,  and it's gonna get better.

Oh, my God, Ben's hot.
Oof.
You got it?
Yeah, he got us so much.
But he was just kicked out of here  'cause your friend is, like, 32.
Ew.
He's so old.
Good job, guys.
Lower, lower.
I love you guys.
Oh, my God.
Anna, no.
Babe.
No.
Sorry, there's a lot  going on in my life.
And the guy I like didn't come.
It's okay.
The guy I like didn't come.
Aww, you're a sad drunk.
My parents hate each other.
I'm stupid.
You got me though.
You got me.
- Ay-ya-ya!
- Oh, she's a fun one.
I'm pissed, too, they didn't come.
They're assholes.
Don't say that, Maya.
Maybe it's still early.
What time is it?
9:00.
Damn, we're supposed  to be back at 8:00, Anna.
No.
Be careful of the old guy  on the way back.
I would go with you,  but I don't wanna leave those two alone.
- Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Jenny, Venice, Ben, love you.
Bye, guys.
Love you.
Bye.
Get off me.
I'm good.
Okay, okay.
Get up.
Get up.
- Is this the right way?
- Oh, my God.
Be normal.
Be normal, Anna.
Anna.
Anna, is that the guy?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my  God.
C'mon, Anna.
Shh.
Please, please get up, please.
Shit.
Shit.
It's a cop.
It's a cop.
Oh, my God, but it could be a fake cop.
Come on, come on, come, come.
Look, when we see your dad,  don't say a lot, okay?
And if you, like, need to lean on me,  then just say you hurt your ankle.
Mm.
You're my uncle.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Shh, shh.
Be quiet.
Your dad.
Hello?
Okay, c'mon.
C'mon.
Ow.
Are you okay?
Did you hurt yourself?
I'm ugly.
Huh?
I'm ugly.
Anna, no, you're not.
I am.
Why would you say that?
No, you loo you're perfect.
God made my made me, like  like he was on crack.
Forgot he was doing a  human, not a mountain.
Mountain.
My nose is like a wedge of cheese.
No, I am the cheese, Anna.
I'm, like, a whole round of it.
I'm a whole round of  it.
Do you understand?
My face is literally  as round as the moon!
Do you get that?
You get that in your thick skull?
I have a freaking round face,  and my face is hairier than a bat!
I have a hairy, fat, round face  like a freaking fat, hairy bat moon!
How would you feel?
Oh, my God, where'd you go?
Oh, my God.
Get up.
Okay.
Get up.
Get up.
Get up.
Throw up.
Oh, God.
What?
Shh.
Shh.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Lay down.
Anna.
Anna?
Hmm.
You okay?
Are you feeling okay?
She's sick, I think.
Um  Oh, okay.
You don't have a fever.
Anna.
Are you drunk?
Dad fuck you.
What?
You're not my mom, I get it.
Maya, what what happened?
How could you let this happen?
Um um yeah.
The these younger kids, um,  were, like they had alcohol and  Okay, tell me.
They were going home and they told us  - to hold it for them.
- Okay.
And then, like, Anna  sipped the tiniest bit  just to, like, see if they  were gonna be okay on it.
- Yes.
- Um, and we were, like  we were just, like,  really scared coming home.
And then, like, you weren't here,  and so we were scared  and, like, we just  Just I'm gonna call 911.
I'm scared.
Hello.
Um, yeah.
Hi.
This is Curtis Kone.
I'm at the Tropicana Hotel.
And, um  My daughter is, um, drunk.
She's she's 13.
Yeah, at the Hotel Tropicana, yes.
Don't press charges.
Anna, how Maya, how much did Anna  Anna, how much did you drink?
Fuck you.
Um, a couple, um, sips.
Okay, just  just, um, a couple of sips.
Oh, okay.
Right.
All right.
Uh  maybe it's mixed in with  food poisoning, I don't know.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
You can't get alcohol poisoning  from a couple of sips.
Wh-what's that?
When you've had too much to drink  and you have to go  to the hospital to get it out.
Anna?
Sweetheart?
You're in trouble.
But I love you.
You'll feel better after getting it out.
Don't tell him.
Anna.
Anna.
I just told your dad, okay?
You have to remember.
Some younger kids came with alcohol.
We were trying to help them Anna.
We were trying Anna, I didn't  ask the guy to buy it for us.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna.
When we wake up, your dad is  gonna ask us where we were.
Remember what we were saying?
What?
You asked the old guy to buy it for us.
And then we drank it.
We drank so much.
No.
No.
Try again.
Kids had it, and we drank it  to protect them.
- So who got it for us?
- You did.
No.
Anna.
Try again.
So who got it for us?
You.
Are you gonna say something?
Dad?
I-I I don't even have the words  for how disappointed in you I am.
I didn't think you were  that kind of a kid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dad, can you please focus?
Like, not on your date?
Please?
Aline and I are just friends.
Oh, yeah, you didn't kiss her?
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
I don't wanna know.
- I did.
- Dad  It made me feel really bad.
And I will do things  differently next time.
And young lady, I hope you do too.
Yes, of course.
Any little amount to drink is wrong.
And it's a cruel lesson  that you got the stomach flu,  Anna, on the same night  as your bad behavior.
So what happened, again?
You didn't drink anything, Maya?
Just Anna did?
We were going home.
Little kids gave us their alcohol.
They were so little.
I was really nervous over them.
And she tasted it just a little  to see if they would  get too drunk, and  So it didn't have  anything to do with those boys?
Bad influences?
Dad, we never saw them again.
But when when we did,  they were they were  perfect gentlemen.
They ditched us  probably 'cause I'm butt ugly.
No, it's my fault.
Maya, you're gorgeous.
My nose is, like, so disgusting.
My face is so big and ugly.
You guys are both gorgeous.
Thanks, Curt.
They ditched you, huh?
I'm trying to think of something to say  to make it better, but, uh  Um  But, you know, we had  a little experience together.
Didn't we?
And we're better off  than we were, right?
Not really.
No, I really like them.
So that's an easy answer.
Give them the benefit of the doubt.
And if they screw you over  again, fuck them.
Be the Anna and Maya I know you are.
Curt, how?
We're leaving today.
Like  Aline said we can  use the pool till 4:00.
Maybe they'll come back.
Okay.
We have a good time here, huh?
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks, Dad.
We didn't even get their screen names.
Yeah.
For the email messages?
Fuck 'em.
- It's called AIM.
- Oh.
It's not email.
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
That's that's them.
That's them.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, that's them.
One sec.
Dad, dad, dad.
One sec.
Stop.
Stop just for a second.
Be chill.
Be chill.
Hey.
Oh, my God, hey.
Whoa, what are you  guys, like, doing here?
Whoa.
Nothing.
What are you looking for?
Yeah, my earring dropped.
It's in your ear.
Freddy, we hoped we'd see you guys again  - in, like in In Da Club.
- Yeah, we went your room too,  but maybe we, like, heard  the number wrong or something.
- Maya.
Maya.
- No, no.
I thought about it all night.
I couldn't sleep.
- Like  - Same.
We felt like we were  supposed to be with you.
Make sure you were okay.
But, like, um, he got grounded  'cause his mom found out  we used the jacuzzi again.
So stupid.
Not her.
- Oh.
- The situation.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We aren't actually staying here.
Yeah.
Uh, we just live nearby.
Not here.
So our bad.
Yeah, but we've waiting out here  'cause maybe you'd  walk by and we say hi.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Like, now we're leaving.
Fuck it all, like  Um, can we have your  screen names, maybe?
Anna!
- Sorry.
- Okay, yeah.
Don't lose them.
Oh, my God, they're gone.
JK.
You ladies are funny.
I don't wanna leave you, hon, like  Yeah, hon, me too.
I  really, really don't.
You have the gum to remember us by.
You're, like, the shit.
Can we have something of yours?
Okay.
- Here.
- Here.
I'll treasure it, babe.
Forever, baby.
Enjoy it, baby.
Think of me.
Stay safe, okay?
Bye.
Bye, hon.
Bye.
Bye, babe.
Bye.
I can see it on your face.
You got a perfect ending.
- Smile.
- Dad, stop.
Oh, my God, Curt.
- Stop.
- Please, stop.
I know, it's annoying.
But you'll look back on this  and really, like maybe.
You'll get that someday, sweetie.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1  Last time on Pen15  I just think the real thing  is that we've changed.
Yeah.
So weird.
It's like, I think  we're on another level.
But you look so beautiful, Maya.
You look like your mother.
I don't look anything like her.
She's ugly.
Maya, stop acting like  a little spoiled bitch.
I don't like you.
You're ugly.
Maya.
You're gonna be okay.
My parents, they're divorcing,  but they kind of share the house.
Sounds worse than  the "every other weekend" deal.
Did your mom tell you?
She's getting the house?
You'll have to decide  who you want to live with.
- Wait.
- That's the lead.
Oh, my God!
- That is incredible.
- Wait.
I know that you cast your play already,  but if you have an  understudy role, I'm free.
We're techies we handle  all the technical elements of the play.
Kone, I'm making you stage manager.
Maya, you gotta remember your lines.
All you have to do right now  is just, like, pep me up.
- Good luck.
- Okay, you just jinxed me.
- It's "Break a leg".
- Ready, star?
Sam, how much do you like Maya  on a scale of one to ten?
Maya Ishii-Peters?
You were just really good in the play.
I've never seen you like that before.
When we sorta kissed in my room,  you said that you had butterflies.
I-I didn't.
It's not you.
It  Maya!
Vince Carter put his  whole arm in the rim.
I know, he was, like,  hanging there from his elbow.
I know.
Sam.
Anna, stop.
Hey.
Hey.
Turn around.
Like  She said my name.
I know.
I didn't.
Turn around.
So, like, do you think  that the dress is too short, or  - No, I love it.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Alex doesn't like it.
What?
I love it.
- I think you should wear it.
- All right.
Look at his shoes.
I think I saw them at Payless.
- Sad.
- I know.
Those are disgusting.
Oh, my God.
Does anyone know what  these lines stand for?
Hmm?
These six lines stand  for the six million people  killed in the Holocaust.
Jewish people, gypsies,  handicapped people, homosexuals,  but mostly Jews were rounded up  by the Nazis, put in camps,  and eventually killed.
Six million lives.
Can you even comprehend that?
These camps  Oh, my God, I feel, like, so bad  for the Jewish people in World War II.
I do too.
I could cry, honestly.
Over time by their  ruthless Nazi captors.
- Me too.
- When a Nazi would show up  at a Jewish person's door,  they were given one hour  to pack a bag  before being loaded into a train  and taken away forever.
Yes, Miss Roth?
I'm Jewish,  and it's really messed up, you guys.
- I'm half.
- Oh, yeah.
My grandfather once married  a Jewish woman,  but they got divorced after a year.
Ah.
Okay.
It's actually such crazy timing  that we're talking about  the Holocaust right now,  because my bat mitzvah's next weekend.
Everyone in this class  is invited, obviously,  but you guys, I haven't  received all the RSVPs.
So please, please, please RSVP.
All right, guys, guys yeah.
I heard there's  gonna be Dippin' Dots.
- At the party.
- Shh.
And you have an assignment.
- Shh.
- Guys.
You guys, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be bossy.
- There's just he's talking.
- Thank you.
- There's an assignment, so  - Mr.  Thank you.
I'm trying to write it down.
Thank you.
Your homework assignment is  to present to the class  what single item  that you would bring with you  if the Nazis showed up at your door.
Oh, my God.
You know, if we were  in the States in this time,  we'd be in the internment camp.
Blah, blah, blah, blah, Mama.
I just, like I don't know  what I'm gonna wear.
I feel like, if I'm gonna go,  I should wear  the spaghetti strap dress, maybe?
Or, like, get Focus on your homework.
- I am, Mom!
- Please.
I'm just, like I  don't know what to bring.
I got something of your grandma's.
I'll go get it for you.
You can bring them to school, huh?
Okay?
Okay, I don't care.
Shuji, have you ever been  to a bat mitzvah before?
I'm invited to one.
Yeah, I've been to a couple.
They're bomb.
Yeah, I know.
I think there's gonna be,  like, Dippin' Dots there  or something.
But, like, if I were gonna have  a bat mitzvah,  I feel like, I don't know,  I'd have Mom and Dad get me, like  a water fountain of  Kool-Aid or something.
Mom and Dad could never afford that.
What are you talking  about?
Yeah, they could.
Mom and Dad don't even own this house.
Okay, so what, we live here for free?
No, seriously, like  we're, like, upper-middle class,  like Anna, right?
We're not even middle.
We're probably low.
Lower-middle, if anything.
But, like, we can afford things.
Like, I have clothes and stuff.
We're not poor.
- We're dirt-poor.
- No, we're not.
- Dad has money.
Like   - Dad's basically homeless.
- Stop it!
- Yeah.
- Stop!
- We're extra-poor!
Stop!
Stop it, Shuji.
Say we're not poor.
Stop.
Maya, Maya, we  found some of Ojichan's  and Obachan's things.
You can take them all to  school and share and  this was Obachan's.
Oh, I remember this.
And, oh, look at this.
Oh, some family photo too.
Wow.
Have you heard from your dad?
- Anna!
- Yes.
Is he still in that  crappy motel, or has he  He's still looking for an apartment.
Look, I'm really sorry  I have to go through you,  you know, but it's just   he just won't answer my  He just doesn't want to  talk to you right now,  and you know that, and so, like  Why are you so moody?
Because I'm learning  about the Holocaust, okay?
- Okay.
- Like  Okay, I'm sorry.
- Mom, I'm talking to you.
- Okay.
Why are you leaving?
I get I don't know.
Are we Jewish?
Like, I know that we're  Unitarian and stuff,  and Russian, German, Polish  but are we Jewish?
German.
A lot of German.
Are there Nazis in our family?
No.
Grampy fought them in World War II.
I have his war mementos.
- Mom.
- Yes?
Have I discovered a family secret?
There are no Nazis in our family.
Do you think that Nazis  are all in Hell?
I don't know if Hell exists.
But if it does, they  are definitely there.
But then if it doesn't exist,  you're saying it's just  fine they're in heaven?
I'm I'm saying I don't  even know if heaven exists.
So then if there's no heaven,  where do you go when you die?
I don't know.
I think you just have to be  in the present moment.
Why would He let all this happen?
Why would He let all this happen?
- Grampy?
- No.
God.
Well, maybe God is a she, or  or a nothing, I don't know.
I don't know why evil  exists in this world.
Anna, I don't know.
I don't know why there's suffering.
I don't know.
It doesn't make sense.
No, it doesn't.
And you don't have any answers at all.
I'm sorry.
That's so cute.
I love that.
- It's so pretty.
- Right?
Wait, you've already gotten presents  and your bat mitzvah  hasn't even happened?
You guys, they're just from  family who live far away.
This one's good, but my  cousin got me a necklace  from Claire's.
Like, I get a rash from nickel.
Like, that's why I only wear Swarovski.
Yeah.
Yeah, like,  I know that about you.
Sorry.
All right, gang, time for presentations.
Who wants to go first?
Ishii-Peters, love the enthusiasm.
Okay.
Whoo!
Um  okay, so if the Nazis  showed up at my house  and was like, "You  have one hour to pack,  and you can only bring one thing,"  um, I would bring  this Chanel shopping bag.
Thank you.
That's what you're  bringing to the Holocaust?
That's crazy.
You might die or never  see your family again,  and you'd bring a Chanel shopping bag?
Well, I wasn't  well I also, um I brought  You can only bring one thing.
Thank you, Maya.
So good.
I get it.
You could  put stuff in the bag.
- Shut up.
- Okay.
Becca, why don't  why don't you come up?
Becca, we love you.
I would bring this picture  of my great-great grandparents  who I admire so much.
Thanks.
Great, great.
Um  Miss Kone.
I'd bring a bullet.
To kill Hitler.
So that none of this ever happened.
All right, I don't think  you should have that at school.
I should probably confiscate that.
Yeah, um, I have a question.
How are you gonna shoot without a gun?
- I'd find one at the place.
- That's stupid.
A knife would kill  way more Nazis than one bullet.
No, if you had a ton of bullets,  the bullets would do more.
Are you kidding?
But, Anna, killing is wrong.
- Think about it.
- Is it?
Is it in this situation, though?
Because think about it.
Sometimes you have  to take justice into your own hands  'cause God lets things like this happen.
- If He or She even exists.
- Okay.
You can't say that!
- Guys.
- You can't bring a bullet.
You guys.
You guys.
I feel like it's because  we survived the Holocaust  that so many of us have faith today.
Like, it's this feeling  I get when I'm in temple  that despite all the odds  being stacked against me  and my ancestors, we survived.
And that's how I know God exists.
There's signs around me every day.
It's kind of beautiful.
On a more serious note,  if you guys park in front of the temple  on my bat mitzvah,  my dad will have to tow you.
So, like, do not do that, okay?
Mom, how 'bout this one?
Like  - Maya, no.
No.
- No, no, just to look through.
That's the one she wants.
That's not appropriate  for her.
I don't even have a jewelry like that.
Mom, it's a necklace.
Like, she'll want that.
Oh, how 'bout this one?
Mm, it's nice.
Mom, what is wrong with you?
I'm not giving her a pen.
- Pen is a nice gift.
- Mom, oh, my God.
Ugh, you're, like, so old-fashioned.
Like, you don't understand.
You can't give a pen!
You have to give,  like like, a necklace,  like something like this.
Like, that's something  she would really like,  and I feel like I need to get that.
- You know, you can always   - Mom, seriously, please?
Like, can I just get her this necklace?
Maya, we can always get her 18 dollar.
It's Jewish good luck.
Wow.
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna write a check  or no, I'll just put a bunch  of single dollar bills  in a little envelope,  be like,  "Hey, happy bat mitzvah.
Here's $18 that you can spend  on a can of Coke"!
Are you serious?
You're acting like we're poor!
Like, what is wrong with you?
Literally, you're ruining my life!
Like, I need it!
Guys, guys, come on.
Enough with the yelling,  all right?
Come on.
Uh, Yuki, let's let's just get it.
No I mean, a  necklace from Swarovski?
Yes.
Well, if  it's important to her,  you know, I can play a couple  of more gigs this week.
- I mean, look at her.
- Absolutely not.
No.
- Come on, honey.
- Absolutely not.
It's too expensive.
Welcome to Swarovski.
This is Karen speaking.
How can I help you?
- This necklace, Dad.
- Yeah, hello, Karen.
- Dad, this one.
- Um, I was wondering, uh,  how much it would be total  for the Stone Necklace.
That one's 135.
Wowza.
Listen, uh, Karen, we're, uh  we're trying to get a bat mitzvah gift.
- Dad.
- Is there something a little  - Hi, Karen.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry.
- That's okay.
Um, okay.
How 'bout  how 'bout the Sparkling Dance  Heart Necklace?
How much is that?
That's $120.
Mom, it's only $120.
Mom.
Or how about the Flower Bracelet,  'cause that one doesn't have a chain,  so maybe it's less expensive?
Or  we don't have to.
We don't have to.
I don't want it.
It's okay.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- No.
No.
No.
We're on the phone.
- Hello?
- No, Mom doesn't want  Uh, Karen, yeah.
- Can you just hold on a sec?
- Sure.
Listen, the, um the big diamond  that's that's a little showy.
No, I know.
We don't have to.
Maybe the Sparkling Dance  Heart Necklace  is-is more appropriate for 13.
It's classy.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Hey, um, yeah, Karen.
- Mom, we don't have to.
- Listen, is there any way  - you could do layaway?
- Sure.
- That won't be a problem.
- All right, good.
And ooh, look.
Two-for-one pizza.
Antonio's.
Boi-oi-oi-oing!
Yeah, okay.
All right, are you ready?
Late much?
Oh, my God, that's my gift.
Sorry.
Literally so expensive.
- You guys.
- Sorry.
Sorry, he just stepped on my gift.
- Maya?
- What?
You know how Becca was like,  "Oh, there's, like, a sign  so I know that God exists"?
- Yeah.
- Like, I want that.
Okay.
But I'm not seeing it yet,  so will you pray with me so God hears?
Okay.
God, if you exist,  make the rabbi's handkerchief  fall when I open my eyes.
Oh, my God, this party's,  like, unbelievable.
Oh, my God!
They have Dippin' Dots.
Oh, my God.
Okay, okay.
I'm definitely gonna get  strawberry nanners.
I'm getting it.
Glow sticks!
It's earth's poison.
But I guess it doesn't matter.
I don't care.
When should I give my present to her?
Should I give it now or later?
- What?
- Okay, later.
I'm gonna give it later  because I feel like  she's not gonna even  pay attention to it now.
That's why it's musical-theatre themed.
Thank you guys so much  for coming to my bat mitzvah.
As a woman, I feel  it's my responsibility  to make sure you all have  a great time tonight.
So let's make this party super cool!
Yeah!
What?
You're not having fun?
No, I'm just not in the mood right now.
Yeah.
You sufferin'?
Kinda, yeah.
But I don't know.
It  doesn't matter, actually.
Oh, see  I don't I don't agree with that.
There is nothing that doesn't matter.
You know  Becca's grandma always used to say,  "If you're lucky enough to live"  "live".
"And if you get the chance to dance"  "Dance".
Whoo!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Sorry.
Went in the wrong door.
Kone?
- Oh, my God.
- It's me.
- Steve.
- So embarrassing.
Yeah.
I see that.
Hey.
Hey.
Sorry, I can't breathe.
It's cool.
It's fine.
It's  come on.
Follow me.
Okay.
You know, Becca, you're,  like, so good at singing.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
- You're, like, really good.
- Oh, you guys are so sweet.
Do you take, like, lessons or  I take a few,  but I definitely just love performing.
- Yeah.
- You're a natural.
- So good.
- Thanks.
Hi, Becca.
Congratulations.
It's so amazing.
It's, like, awesome.
Thank you.
Um, I just I have my gift for you,  - so I wanted you to open it.
- Oh, thanks.
You could just put it  on the table behind me.
Or actually, can you  it's just, like, a really special gift,  so if you don't mind,  just, like, open it.
Sure.

You're so cute.
Me too, right, Dad?
I look the same  as that picture?
Yeah, you look the same.
Except you're, like, way bigger  - and you have a mustache now.

Maya, you are a beautiful woman.
Dad, don't call me that.
- Well, you are.
- I'm not a woman, I'm a girl.
Like, I'm a kid.
I'm  one year older than her.
Well, you're a little more mature.

I didn't even mean to say Steve.
Like, that's my husband.
- Has he called you yet?
- Maybe, I don't know.

My bro!

- Get off!
Ow, don't move my arm  like that, you psycho.
Whoa.
"Sooji," your  Japanese is really good.
"Sooji," you and "Oomi" actually  look more related than you and Maya.
Yeah, that's because me  and Maya are half-siblings.
Unfortunately, she got the bad half.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
- Is white the bad half?
- Yeah!
You wish you had more white in you.
You'd look way better, bitch.
I actually think, Shuji,  that you're very, very  attractive the way you are.
Ew, Anna.
Wait, hold on, so the hot dog  guy isn't your dad?
No, uh, my birth dad  lives in Japan.
Yeah, but that's still our dad.
- That's like  - Yeah.
- He's your dad.
- I know.
That's why you and Ume have  such exotic names.
I've always wanted my  name to be Yolanda.
Yeah, and that's why  I can speak Japanese fluently,  and Maya can barely say a sentence.
That's you're lying.
I speak full Japanese.
Tell them.
Perfect, perfect, p perfect.
Are you guys seeing this?
Perfect, perfect, perfect.
Holy shit.
"Oomi," can I play with you?

All right, that's enough.
My turn.
Maya.
Don't move her arm like that.
I didn't move her arm li   I, like, touched her  - like you touched my arm.
- Now she's crying.
Great job, idiot.
Sorry!
She's crying 'cause  everybody loves her?
- Okay, weird.

I mean, honestly, like,  I love her, but she's kind of a problem.
No, and I hope that she's  okay, and I felt super bad,  but I'm also like, everybody's  complimenting you up the ass.
We're sleeping on the floor for you.
Like, can you stop being  such a crazy bitch?
- Yeah.

Like, she'll say  she saw people doing things  that they weren't doing,  like, it's really weird.
Get out!
I mean, I haven't  personally seen her do that,  but I also don't speak Japanese,  so I could be wrong, like, I trust you.
I trust you that you're right.

Everyone thinks she's perfect.
You're so much better than me, okay?

Oh, okay.
Good goodbye, Doctor.

Ah.
Eh?

Okay.

You knowing English and  working as an interpreter  inspired me to learn English.
It's what helped me get this job.
Wow, that's very good.
Yeah.
- Arigato.
- Ooh  Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's only my boobs.
Your boobs?
Stevie Wonder?
- No.
- Yes.
Ah!
Eh?
Ah.
Hey.
I didn't know when you  were gonna come home,  so I made my world-famous daddy chili.
- Were the kids okay?
- Yes, yeah, they loved it.
They're in their rooms.
They're fine.
Oh, and I got some more hot sauce  'cause I didn't see any in the fridge  and I figured you had a woozy  of a day at the  at the bank or, well, wherever you  I don't know where you were.
- I had a long day.
- Yeah, well  - But let me   - Oh, no, come on, please.
Let me do this.
You sit right here.
Oh, okay.
- Thank you.
- All right.
I added a few more  interesting spices here.
- Ah, that's that's enough.
- Ah, it's never enough.
- There you go.
- Thank you, thank you.
Shuji, can you pause the game?
Yeah.
Look.
This reminded me of you.
I love you.
You're my number-one son.
- I'm your only son, Mom.
- I know, but  Anyone would be so lucky to have you.
Okay, okay, thanks,  Mom.
I love you, too.
- Okay, okay.
- Yes.
Thank you for the dope painting.
All right.
- I like it.
- Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Okay.
Back to game.
Oh, my funny girl.
Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.
- I love you.
Do you love me more than Shuji?
Mm, equal.
But you are my number-one daughter,  and I'm so glad you're my daughter.
- That doesn't count.
- Yes, it does.
It's important.
Okay, then can I have  a present like Shuji got one?
Okay, when you turn 18,  I'll give you a present  that I got from Stevie Wonder.
Who's that?
Oh, you don't know?
- No.
- It's okay.
- Now go to sleep, okay?
- I'm not tired.
Yes, you are.
I'll sing you a song.
No, uh, stop.
- Okay, okay, enough, enough.
- I don't want to.
- Go to sleep.
- I don't want to go to bed.
Okay.
Fred?
- Fred?
- Mm, mm-hmm?
Listen.
Are you all right?
I want to tell you a story  that I never told you before.
- Mm-hmm.
- Many years ago  I was working on a film called  "Seven Nights in Japan".
It was a British/Japanese co-production.
And we were all staying  in a small remote village.
And I was the only one  who spoke the two languages.
And the very first morning,  I brought the British crew  to the Japanese dining room.
The whole Japanese crew  were eating breakfast,  and they're all cracking raw egg  and putting it over rice.
The British crew, they all went like,  "Ew, we're not gonna eat that".
So they asked me for milk and sugar.
So this time the Brits pour sugar  and milk over hot rice.
And when they were eating this,  the Japanese crew all went, "Ew".
And I was always in the middle  of the two cultures,  stuck there.
And I feel like I've been like that  with you and with my family.
Sometimes I never know  what's right by you  and what's right by the kids.
I'm being too Japanese  or trying to be too American.
I feel like I'm always stuck  in the middle of the two cultures.
You  you never talk about this.
But I'm happy right now.
I'm happy with this life.
You were gone a long time today.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Driver.
Are we almost there?
Goal!
Right after that, I  snapped his headphones.
Did your parents react?
They stay out of it.
They don't really give a shit.
Eager Anna.
Thank you.
Um, I just wanted to say  that what you all are going through  is intense but wonderful.
Kudos.
For me, I have a hamster,  and my Dad got it for me.
Its name is Daddy  'cause I named it that,  and I love it.
Couldn't help but feel like  maybe my Dad is just trying  to sweeten me up by getting me the pet  because he wants me to live  with him, not with my mom.
Yeah, wow, y-you don't have any problems  opening up and sharing, do you?
You remind me of my mailman.
Thank you.
Um, and actually  just going between the two places  my mom's place and my dad's place  it's hard,  and my mom is, like, always late.
Always.
And my Dad is grumpier.
And he didn't get the house,  and I'm just like, if  he doesn't get me, too,  I don't know what he's gonna do.
You talk like you're 40, kind of.
Thank you.
And that's actually a good thing,  because most people don't reach  their full potential  until they're at least 38.
Oh, my goodness, it's  time for us to wrap it up.
Thank you for opening up  and sharing, everyone.
Get all your stuff.
Don't forget your shoes.
Oh, it's just my shoes.
Remember to breathe.
Ciao!
- Thanks, Tina.
- See ya.
What's up?
Hey.
So, uh, you seeing the world  through rose-colored lenses now?
No, seriously, I don't get  what the point of it is  'cause, like, they just listen  and they, like, don't  give you advice, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Basically, we  diagnose based on a spectrum,  and Maya happens to be  a little bit above average  on that spectrum.
Maya, do you have trouble focusing?
No, I'm actually really smart.
Oh, I know you're very  smart.
That's not the issue.
Attention Deficit Disorder  is actually quite common,  and many of our patients  have found success  taking methylphenidate hydrochloride.
Medication for this?
It is a stimulant,  but it actually has the opposite effect  on kids who have ADD.
It helps them focus.
Maya, then you just  better pay more attention.
- I do.
- That's all this is.
- Stop.
Stop.
- No.
You know,  Maya is jumping off  the walls like crazy.
And I love that about  you, darling, I do.
But not at school.
And with every medication,  there are some side effects.
Most commonly, increased heart rate.
But the benefits do  outweigh any discomfort.
No, I don't wanna take the medicine  if it's gonna speed up my heart.
Once you acknowledge the problem,  she can have extra time on tests  and other assistance that can  help Maya improve her scores.
Extended time on testing?
Yeah, as much time as you need.
We'll talk about it at home.
I think I wanna take the medicine.
- No.
- We'll talk about it.
Mom, I wanna take it!
Oh.
Stop.
Stop.
Maya  uh, how do you feel  about fluorescent lights?
I don't feel good about  fluorescent lights.
Anna.
Anna.
Anna.
Stop.
What are you  Oh, just stare at whatever you want.
Like, so stupid.
- They're crazy.
- I know.
I like that, uh  I like when your mom's late.
- Oh, yeah?
- Which is, like, all the time.
I know.
Ope.
- Hey.
- I know, I'm late.
Yeah.
Who's that guy?
Who are you talking about?
- Mr. Loser.
- There's no one there.
There's a guy right there.
Doesn't even know how to ride his bike.
I don't know who that is.
He's in Teens in Need.
Okay.
Just get in the back.
Irlen syndrome  is a light sensitivity  that can contribute  to reading difficulties,  headaches, trouble concentrating.
But what can help  Is wearing these special glasses.
Do I have to wear these  all day, like, every day?
Well  Look at Haley Joel  Osment on the red carpet.
He has Irlen syndrome.
He looks great.
Very cool.
I love it.
And I know you want me  to do my own laundry.
About that  But I'm just it's hard  with all the Teens in  Need and everything.
I can't have dirty underwear.
- Thank you.
- I got it.
But maybe, just maybe,  I've found someone to help us with that.
Maybe, just maybe, what?
Found someone to help.
Found someone to help us with that?
A maid?
Mom.
A maid?
Surprise!
Oh, you're late.
Huh.
Grammy.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Oh, and here I am as a surprise.
I was going to help out  for the foreseeable future.
- How are you?
- Hello.
Yeah.
You know, I keep telling you  this, and you don't listen.
You're slouching.
And if you continue to slouch,  you're going to get  one of those stomach pooches  just like your mother.
Ha-ha.
Mom, stop.
Oh, well.
I think I'm going to go  and make us some dinner.
Okay.
Thanks, Grammy.
- Mm-hmm.
- Love you.
Well, yes, thank you.
Bring the groceries.
Near the volcano,  it is distinguished  by a network of cracks.
Where were you?
My Grammy just moved in with us.
- What?
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah.
What?
I love these.
I have to wear them 'cause I have ADD  and Irlen syndrome.
And literally, like, I have  to take this medication  that can speed up your  heart rate and kill you.
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.
- Maya.
- I know.
- I can't lose you.
- I know.
Shh.
Girls.
Movie.
And Maya, no Oakleys in the classroom.
I actually have Irlen syndrome.
Um  and I need to wear these  'cause they're prescribed.
So yeah.
And I'm also supposed  to be on medication right now,  but I'm not on it.
So I'm just having,  like, a really hard day.
Hey, Bowl Cut.
"The Matrix" called.
Neo wants his glasses back.
Haley Joel Osment wears them.
So did you hear  from Steve's friend Derrick?
Did he call you?
You mean the high schooler  that's gonna be my boyfriend?
- Yeah.
- No, he hasn't.
But I'm just kind of, like, waiting.
- I feel like any day now.
- Yeah.
When he does, we're  gonna go on double dates.
Um  wait, if your Grammy is living with you,  does that mean I can still  sleep over tonight or no?
Oh, my mom's gonna  take us to Blockbuster.
Shh!
Sorry.
She's such a bitch.
Hi, Mr. Corlado  - Anna, stop.
- Stop.
Oh, my God.
Why is my mom honking?
- Oh, my God.
- What is she doing?
Why is she doing that?
- Come on, come on.
- Get in, get in.
Oh, hi, honey.
Come on in.
No, not there.
I have my oxygen tank.
Wait, is that your Grammy?
- Yeah.
- Get in the backseat.
That's good.
I didn't know you were picking us up.
- Well  - Hi.
Well, no, Mom is very busy  with her "rackas" clients.
It's reiki, but  Racka, reiki, ra  Did you know did you know  that your mother went through  a whole year of her RN,  and then she met your Dad.
And we all know how that worked out.
Yeah.
Is she blind?
Um, hi, Grammy.

It's Mrs. Ryan.
Um, Grammy, can we go to Blockbuster?
'Cause my mom was gonna take us.
- No.
- Sorry, Grammy?
Yeah?
Um, you don't have to honk,  'cause it'll move.
Don't tell me what to do.
If you learned how to type,  it meant you wanted to be a secretary.
So we took Home Economics  so we could get a good husband.
Mom?
- Where are we going?
- This way.
Thank you.
Mom?
You don't have to yell so much.
I mean, you're a tall girl  with a tall voice to match.
Let's go.
Sorry.

Where do I put my stuff?
Just wherever.
Maya,  you've been here before.

Uh, Grammy, they're closed.
Well, call again.
Maybe  you got the wrong number.
I got the voicemail.
It's definitely them.
They're just closed,  but I can call again tomorrow.
Well, if you hadn't been  lollywagging so much at school,  maybe we could have gotten here  and I could have gotten my hair done.
You're just like your mother.

You have ADD?
Hmm.
Well, you know, everyone only has  a certain amount of  beats in their lifetime.
Really?
That's why I'm so very quiet and still.
Oh, my God.
I got you water.
Two cubes, Grammy.
Oh, darling, you know I don't  drink water with my pills.
I only take sherry.
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay  You sit down.
Gra grammy?

Um, I brought you some  stacked crackers and cheese  because I love you.
Did you wash your hands  before making me the  cheese and crackers?
Um  Just do it.
Just do it.
- Sorry, Grammy.
- Please that's right.
Do I need to wash my hands too?
Yesterday.
Did you wash  your hands really well?
Yes.
Wait, Anna, wait.
Do we have to hang out  with her the whole time?
I mean, I know I'm exhausted.
The funny thing is that  she was actually here to help.
I feel like she hates me.
She hates me so much more.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God, this is gonna  be my entire childhood.
Okay, we should go.

You're about to go to a funeral.
What's your problem?
You're acting like Looney Tunes.
Take this pill.
No, I don't wanna take the pill.
- I don't wanna die!

There's only so many  heartbeats in a lifetime.

Sorry about your G-ma.
Should I go now?

Okay.
Bye, Grammy.
Bye, Grammy.
That was weird.
Yeah.
Um, if everyone wouldn't  mind taking a seat,  I'd like to say a few  words about my mother.
Oh, before I forget, lunch  will be served upstairs.
It's nothing elaborate,  but we hope you'll stay  and share your memories.
Oh, my God.
Is that Derrick?
- Oh, my God.

Okay.
Okay.
All right.

Olay is her middle name?
- I didn't   - Stop.
My mom.
Geraldine Olay Ryan.
She was a character.
She didn't smile a lot.
No, she didn't.
Geraldine Olay Ryan was a mother  that I loved very much.
Yame nasai.
When I found her facedown,  sprawled out  It's an image that  I won't get out of my head.
That's quite enough, young lady.
With the oxygen tank  blowing air to no one.
Where was I?
She was the first to graduate  college in her family.
And I'm really grateful  that my daughter and I  got to spend her last days  with her.
I want cheese with that.
- Ow!
- That was so inappropriate.
Stop.
It's not my fault.
That was Anna.
She started it.
Do you need to take more medicine?
No.
I don't even feel it yet.
I don't even feel it.
Oh, wait.
Mama?
Mom?
I think I'm feeling it now.
Anna.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Sorry, um, for what I did.
Like, my reaction wasn't, like, normal.
- It's okay.
- Really?
Yeah.
I think maybe it is normal.
It's okay.
Pretty freaky, huh?
I'm on methylphenidate  hydrochloride right now.
I tried that once.
It was fun.
I'm Derrick.
Wassup?
I'm Maya.
I know.
Thank you.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Hey.
Hey, Dad.
How you guys doing?

Again, Kath, I'm sorry.
She was unique.
I loved her too.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
I mean, I know I know  she was hard on you  and she messed up a bit, you know,  here and there.
But I know how proud of you she is.
- Was.
- Was.
Yeah, maybe, I don't  Thank you.
- I'm gonna go, okay?
- Okay.
That laughing, not funny.
- Dad.
- I'm serious.
I'm sorry.
You have a little bit of  growing up to do, all right?
- Okay.
Stop.
Not now.
- It's too much.
Take care of your mom, all right?
She needs you.
Okay.
Bye.
Love you.
Sweet of him to come.

Sometimes Steve.
Yeah, it is.
Most of the time Steve.
So I brought my fried Maya.
No, I don't wanna speak right now.
- Hi, Maya.
- Hi, Maya.
Sorry, she doesn't wanna  speak right now.
So  um, but for me, I'll just say that, um,  I'm afraid that  my Dad is really mad at me right now.
And that's because I  told him that I wanted  to live with my mom.
And I told him over the phone.
And I could tell by just  the tone of his voice  that he was really, really sad.
I don't want to disappoint him,  but I told him that my  mom needs me right now  'cause my Grammy just passed.
I'm just really worried about him.
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss.
- Thanks, Sasha.
- I'm good, actually.
I'm not good, but I'm okay.
She's okay, 'cause  you, like, laughed during the eulogy,  so it's not, like, that sad.
Well, it's just that a  word struck me funny,  but I'm not No, I know.
You laughed, too, so I don't  know why you'd say that.
Yeah, well, it's not my Grammy, though.
- Like  - I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I have ADD and Irlen syndrome.
Oh.
Well, thank you so  much for sharing, Maya.
You're welcome.
Oh.
Nice, nice.
Stop.
Hey.

Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Do you have your meds?
Like, no, on opposite day.

No, it's your responsibility.
Are you kidding?
Ugh.
I already used both sides!
Look on your bed, sweetie.
My bed?
Grammy's hand-me-downs.
She'd want you to have them.
Enjoy.

Yeah and it's through  my Unitarian Church in Conchamaguet.
Um, we're just selling luminaries.
So if I can just have  another moment of your time.
"You can choose a message  for your survivor"  "or beloved deceased  you want to remember".
"We'll write it for you on a bag".
No, no, I'm sorry.
No, thank you.
Bitch.
- Oh, my God.

It just, like, sucks.
He's not coming.
Okay, I'm sorry.
You didn't get mad at Steve when  he jumped on your back,  but you did when I did.
Well, that's because  he didn't put pressure on it.
- You know I have a bad back.
- I'm sorry.
So am I.  Oh, my God.
Hi, how are you?
Would you like to buy  a luminary for the Walk  for Cancer, please?
I like your hair.
You're very cute.
Are you fifth graders?
Um, "so you can choose  a message for your survivor"  "or beloved deceased  that you want to remember.
"And we'll write it for you on the bag.
"The " "The message  "is a celebration of  a loved one touched by cancer.
"And on the night of the walk,  each bag becomes a luminary  "lit within by a candle and that light.
- "Reminiscent  - "Reminiscent of  "your loved one's" my turn.
"Loved one's fighting spirit,  which we celebrate today".
What'd he say?
- What?

He's talking to his mom.
It's just this person spelled Kevin,  Kevine with an E look.
Are you talking to me or him?
Hi, sorry, Steve.
I was just talking to Maya.
Yeah.
Oh, my God, Steven.
We've been talking on the phone  for, like, so long.

Isn't it good?
Is it okay?

I'm sorry.
No.
I don't know.
Do you swear to God?
No, but you do sound mad at me.
Okay, I love you.
Love you so much, bye.
Are you still on?
Is he mad?
Um, he can't come  because they have plans.
Why can't they  just cancel on each other?
Maya, they have plans,  and they promised each other  they were going to do  it, so they can't cancel.
Okay, sorry, but then maybe it's better  that it's just you and me and not Steve  'cause it's been you  guys hanging out a lot.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Maya, maybe you should  call Derrick because, like,  if he wants to come,  then he might want to  change his plans and see you,  and then Steve will come too.
- I don't want to.
- Maya, no, please.
No, Anna, I don't want to call him.
Why?
Because he's, like,  been really busy and stuff.
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
He's not calling me back, so I don't  Please, he loves you.
I, like, don't even know his number.
Oh, my God, yes.
He loves you so much.
Shh!
Oh, my God.
Hey, it's Maya.
- Maya.
- He loves you.
No, I'm calling you from Anna's phone.
I didn't block my number.
Oh, 'cause you have caller ID.
No, yeah, it's just Anna's phone.
- Ask about the bowling.
- Um, are you guys  gonna be coming to  the Walk for Cancer tomorrow?
D?
What'd he say?
Are they gonna come?
Oh, he hung up.
They can't come.
Whatever.
It'll be better anyway without them.
It can just be you and me.
Anna, it's fine.
Anna, me and you time  and people with cancer.
It'll be fun.
Hello, everyone.
Very happy to be here  with all of you today.
Let's do this, you guys.

Oh, my God, what is wrong?
You're being really crazy right now.

Sorry.
Anyway, I just want to honor him today  as we walk.
Now, I'm Roger, by the way.
- Hi, Roger.
- I have a question.
Are we gonna walk the whole 24 hours?
'Cause I don't think that's possible.
Okay, we're gonna need a talking stick  because people keep interrupting.
I raised my hand.
This team is going to  walk in shifts, okay?
So no, it won't be the whole time.
Oh.
The walk is starting now.

And, like, how many miles  we're supposed to walk.
Yeah, I can't I can't  even do a mile run.
So I don't know.
Yeah, it's 'cause it turns  into the mile walk every time.
Anna, are you in a better mood now?
No, that just was funny.
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm  here and it's not Steve.
I'm the one who's, like,  making you happy.
Anna, stop.
Oh, my God, okay, I thought  this was the Walk for Cancer?
- Maya   - I just I take it back.
That was mean.
That was mean.
No, I didn't mean it.
'Cause you were trying to laugh at me.

Anna, stop.
Get up.

This is your mom, Anna.
You have to get up right now.

I know.
I don't want to talk about it.
I want to hook up with the guy from  this wouldn't happen  if Derrick and Steve were here.
Let's go, let's pick up that pace  a little bit back there.
We're walking for a cure here today.
Wait, it's actually stuck.

It's stupid, too, though.

Come here, I want  to whisper something to you.
Just say it out loud.
Stop.
I can't, seriously.
Okay.
Brett thinks you're cute.
- What'd you just say, Sean?
- Nothing.
I was just telling Ann here  that you think she's cute.

He almost got class president this year.
- And he's fucking funny.
- Nah, nah, nah.

Mm-hmm.
Kiss him.
Why not?
I can't 'cause I have a boyfriend.
- I told you that.
- We went over this.
I'm not a cheater.
She said they're, like, buried or  - No, I was, like, kidding.
- They're not dead.
They're just, like  they're in high school, so.
They are probably cheating on you.
- What?
- Honestly.
With some high school girls.
Well  Just kiss him.
You shouldn't let  boyfriends rule your life.
Yeah, you should be independent.

Yes, he does.
I swear to God he  does.
That's fucked up.
Cool.
You guys, that's, like, really fucked up  to joke about that.
Like, that's not cool.
Yeah, he knows it's not a joke.
- It's his life.
- You guys, it's not funny.
See?
He does.
That could've been a haircut.
Ask him yourself.
Do you?
Do do you have cancer?
Yeah.
If you're not lying, I'm sorry.
Sorry, if you're not lying.
So you gonna kiss him?
- Should we keep walking?
- Yeah.
Wait, wait.
Just give my man a kiss on the cheek.
Oh, okay.

Okay.
Oh, my God.

I'll see you guys out there.
See ya.

- Peace.
Bye.
Oh, my God, the tent.
If anyone sees my wife,  can you please tell her that  I'm looking for her?
I'm out here in the field.
The 50-yard line.
- Okay, that was crazy.
- Yeah.
- He was lying, right?
- I felt bad, but I don't know.
- I think so, yeah.
- No, I know, I felt bad too.
But I'm kind of like, everyone  gets a haircut like that.
- Like, it's called a buzzcut.
- Yeah.
Supercuts or whatever.
My God, that would be so messed up.
You think he just yeah.
I feel sick, though.
I don't know why.
Assholes, come here.
Us?
You two.

Did you tell my little brother  he doesn't have cancer?
What?
Did you tell my brother  he doesn't have cancer?
- Um no   - I'm so pissed right now.
We we didn't.
Um right?
- No, we didn't.
- Cool.
So you go in a tent with them,  act all flirty,  tell Brett that he doesn't have cancer,  and laugh when he shows you his hair?
- No, no, we didn't laugh.
- We were, like, um  - Oh, my God, okay.
- We were, like, um  Don't say God.
You're anti.
So this is just a misunderstanding  'cause what happened is,  we were on the track.
Um, sorry.
Um Spit it out.
Sean asked us to go in his tent.
Yeah, 'cause he wanted us to, like  - Yeah and he was, like   - Kiss him or whatever.
To kiss him.
He has cancer.
And so I was like, "Oh, are you lying?
Or are you just trying  to get play?
Or "  We didn't know if it was  play or lying or, like  He's not lying about that.
We didn't know.
Sorry.
Just stay the fuck away from my brother.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Anna, Anna, do you think  these people are sick?
Sorry.

Yo.

Did your hair get longer?
It's hot.

Hey, what's up?
I thought you'd be happy  that we came here.
No, I'm not upset.
I'm just  Um, I'm just really tired.
We were, like, sleeping, so  It's, like, 6:00.
Okay, but it was kind of dark out.
Yeah, and we almost got, like, beat up.
- Do we need to take someone?
- No.
- Um, what happened to bowling?
- Where are your meds?
Well, I took my Friday pill  'cause I didn't think  you were coming, like  Lame.
Also, these guys tried  to hook up with us, D.  - What?
- Yeah.
Not my girl.
Not mine.
No, I didn't do it.
I swear, I didn't.
I just, like, on the cheek  'cause he has cancer.
Did you kiss him too?
Yeah, just on the cheek really quick.
Just 'cause he's sick.
Yeah, like, he might not  ever get a real one, so.
Oh, yeah.
- What?
- You're not talking that much.
Are you what's up?
Did you want us to leave?
Steve, I just told  you what was going on.
And, like, also,  sorry, but can you be sensitive  'cause it's the Walk for Cancer,  and my grandmother just died of cancer?
Yeah.
I didn't know you cared that much.
Wasn't it emphysema?
- Uh, yeah, it's cancer.
- No, that's not cancer.
Whatever.
Stop being, like, insensitive.
Are you two on your  periods or something?
She doesn't get that yet.
- I'm going to sleep too.
- What?
- How old are you?
- 13!
Ew, dude, that kind of grosses me out.
She doesn't get her period yet.
What are you, dude?
- A pedophile?
- I'm not.
You're, like, a pedophile, man.
Why don't you just  date a sixth grader, bro?
- Steve  - Okay, man.
Shut up.
- I have my period.
- Like, right now?
- What?
That's gross.
- I don't have it right now.
I'm just saying I have it.
I'm not, like, a freaking pedophile.
Good 'cause that would be gross.
I don't want to know when you  have your period, like, ever.
- I want you to stay hot.
- Okay.
You should grow your hair longer.
Lucy Liu.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- You want some?
- What is it?
Vodka.
Um  I, like, had a lot already.
Chug, chug.
- No, thanks.
- You guys are being annoying.
I'm over it.
Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.
Just just tired.
- Yeah, I am too.
Drunk.
Okay, then let's go to sleep, like.
Okay, but girls in the middle  so Steve and I no gay, dude.
Shh, there's people  like that on our team.
I just don't want our butts to touch.
You're missing out.
Be sensitive, like  Are you okay that they're here?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Do you want them to go?
Okay.
Are you sure you're okay?
I'm sorry we didn't come in earlier.
I love you.
I love you too.
Your knee is in my back.
That's my dick.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Oh, my God.
- They fucking ditched us.
What time is it?
Hey, everybody.
My name is Carl, and I'm sorry  that you all had to listen  to my voice today on the megaphone.
It's hard to describe cancer itself  because it was always just about  these special words they had.
You know, mass.
Be strong.
Survivor.
Have goals.
Remission.
All of these key words, but  the thing that I get to connect  with a lot of you about  today is the, uh, the departure.
That the people we love go on  before they're even gone.
A mother, a father.
They go on this trip,  and we don't get to go on it with them.
This trip takes them somewhere else.
It's like for some of  them, the pain is so great  that the only relief is  to take a bunch of drugs.
Just the day before, their  sickness was just a concept  because we couldn't  see this ride coming.
And then the next day,  it's not a concept anymore  because it it's a whole  different ride suddenly.
And, uh but I think what we all do,  the friend, the daughter, the father,  the survivor, I think the strength  that's needed to attend  this this, uh,  this mountain of a ride  with no definite end point,  no known destination,  is for the fearless and the brave.
And tonight, right now,  we're all here together  on this same ride, and  it's an honor for me  to connect with all of  you and to be here now.
Tonight, I know that I'm not alone.
It's not that kind of luminary.
- It's not that kind   - Sorry.
It doesn't float.
I thought it was gonna float up.
Like the ones that float.
So I'm here, a guy who doesn't  really do things like this.
I'm really glad that I'm here with you.
Me too.
Just you.
I'm very fortunate  because I'm in remission today.
Can we have a moment of silence, please?
Thank you all so much.
Sorry you lost your mom.
What?
I'm sorry, um   I'm sorry you lost your mom.
Love you.
I love you.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Okay, why do you keep doing that?
Um, they feel like marshmallow.
Think that's what happens  when you get your braces off.
Oh, my God, they look so different.

Um, a little, because this morning  I woke up, and, like, my  boobs were a little bigger.

Mom, Anna's gonna be a model.

It's New York, Philadelphia, Tucson  Like, it's all of them,  and then we can go.
Fine, how much and when?
I told you, the appointment is today,  and it's, like, 3,000 bucks.
- No.
- Please, Mom.
I am not spending this kind of money  on this kind of thing.
We shouldn't be paying them,  they should be paying you!
You keep saying that.
Not the good places.
I am done talking about this.
You don't get it at all.
I've wanted to model since  I was literally born.
Do I help Every  sign points to a scam.
And I didn't know you've  been wanting to do this  since you were born.
Does a scam have a pamphlet?
So I don't know why  you keep saying that.
Do you just think I'm too ugly to model?
You already have a  freshman boyfriend, okay?
And this is where I draw the line.
Okay, well, the good news  is, is, you're not the boss.
Ever think of that?
So I am calling Dad.
Great, call him.
'Cause he's the real boss, you bitch.
You're a bitch.
Oh, am I?
That's so mature.
You're the one who is  acting like a bitch.
Why do you talk to me like that?
I'm the adult.
I know better.
You're the kid.
Act like a kid.
Don't leave.
Don't leave.
Mom!
No, honestly Anna,  if you were my daughter,  I would totally let you model.
You've done a runway show before,  and you, like, you wear hats so well.
Yeah.
They just, like, treat me like a kid.
Otherwise they're just, like,  "Oh, do everything, you're an adult".
And then, like, they treat me like a kid  when it's convenient for them.
Yeah, they're psychopaths.
Like, you need to get out of there.
Like, I'm I'm not kidding.
Can I sleep over?
Yeah, definitely.
Thanks.
When you come here, I'm gonna, like,  take pictures of you,  and I'm gonna prove  that you're a model.
Like, you seriously  are such a model.
- You're more beautiful.
- Okay, I gotta go.
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, love you, bye.
What?
Look what Mom and Dad let me get.
What is that?
Nokia 3310.
Oh, my God.
Cell phone, dummy.
Nokia 3310.
Strawberries.
It's got a calculator and a stopwatch.
So now I can time how long it takes you  to do something annoying.
- Dank.
- Stop!
- Mom?
- Hmm?
Do you have a present for me?
Yeah, I got the stains out for you.
Where's my cell phone?
Well, you're not mature enough  for a cell phone, Maya.
What are you even talking about?
Not mature enough?
You don't even know how to wipe.
What are you even talking about?
I wipe fine, Mom.
11 seconds.
Stop, Shuji.
Mom, I'm so mature.
Why don't I have a cell phone?
When you're in eighth grade,  maybe you can have your own.
Eighth gr I'm, like,  never gonna reach eighth grade.
What are you even talking about?
Here's my number.
You can call me  when you learn how to wipe my butt.
- Mom!
- Shuji, stop.
That's so unfair.
This is you being immature.
So you love him more than me?
- Okay, I'm gonna run away.
- Okay.
So, you're okay with that?
That I'm running away?
Yeah.
Mom, you're okay with me running away?
I'm going to run away.
All right, I'll see you later.
Oh, my God.
Okay, so you're okay with your daughter  running away?
Running away!
I hate you!
Do you hear that, Mom?
You're never gonna see me again!
I hate you!
I'm gonna die on the street!
Mama, can you drive me  to Anna's first, though?
Hello?
It's Maya.
Mai?
I thought I was coming to you.
I don't want to be there anymore.
Like  What's wrong?
My mom gave Shuji a cell phone  and said that I wasn't  mature enough for one.
Oh, my God, that is insane, Mai.
You're the most mature person  I've ever met.
I know.
That's what I said to her.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
I just don't want to be there anymore.
I think we should run away.
- Mai  - I'm serious.
I know, but it's, like,  I want to be with you,  of course I want to be with you,  but, like, where are we gonna go,  and, like, what are we gonna eat?
Anna, you're gonna model.

Like, you make tons of money from that,  and that's, like, what we spend.
We can, like, spend it on whatever.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
I mean, I have to try out still.
But I actually don't  have a parent's consent.

You really think I could model?

Yeah.
My daughter's gonna be a model.

I don't know if all of this  is, like, the best idea.
Why?
Well, it's just, like, I don't know.
No, I'm so excited.
I'm, like  I can't wait.
Honestly, I'm just, like,  where are we gonna sleep?
Or, like, what are we gonna eat?
And, like  Oh, see, you always know what I need.
No, I don't want you to feel stressed.
I think this is gonna be fun.

Okay, it's on, it's on.
I freaking love this song.

Every time you hear this song,  think about how I'm  breaking up with you.
'Cause that's what I'm doing right now.
What's wrong with her?
What's wrong with you?
They want to know.
Nothing.
It's just my high school boyfriend said,  "Every time you hear this  song, I want you to think  "about me breaking up with you  'cause that's what I'm doing right now".
So now, I keep listening to this song  over and over again  and keep thinking about  how he broke up with me.
So it's just a cycle of  listening to this song  until I can get the  him breaking up with me  out of my head, so I  just gotta keep listening  to this song till it's done.
You know what this guy sounds like?
He sounds like a straight-up  Lo-ser.
Look at me.
Hello there!
It's, like, not even how you do it.
Lo ser!
Loser!
Yeah, you're she's  much better at it than me.
I'm not.
So this guy is your  boyfriend's best friend?
Yeah.
Why?
You know the saying, right?
"You are what you eat".
And Steve is eating Derrick's  asshole, so to speak.
So if you just if you  draw the connection  So you're saying they're both shitty?
I mean, kind of.
Okay, genius, thank you so much.

And he's screwing over my friend.
I mean, they just don't jive.
She didn't respect his music.
- I don't know.

That is not an excuse.
He's a psycho.
- It wasn't cool.
- Yeah, it wasn't.
What else do you want me to say?
Well, you're it wasn't cool.
It was dishonorable what he did.
But it'd be dishonorable  for a best friend to  Okay, so you're not coming?
I'm not gonna egg my best  friend's house, Anna.
Okay, you chose sides.
"I'm not in this world to live up  "to your expectations, and  you're not in this world  to live up to mine".
Not everything is a saying.
Like, it's kind of a cop out.
And you chose sides, and it's not mine,  so I'm not choosing yours.
I don't want to go out with you anymore.
Anna  You've made your choice.
I respect it.
And I went to the bathroom  and I was and as I was  walking into the stall,  it was just like a needle.
Nah, he's not coming?
No.
What happened?
Um, we just broke up.
What?
Oh, my God.

Okay.
Sorry, I'm just thinking about Steve.
He's just, like, not at  all who I thought he was.
And, like  Dude, you deserve way  better than that scrub.

I can't believe it's gonna be, like,  eighth grade, and then high  school, and then college.
And, like  Yeah, it's crazy.
Do you think that there's ever a time  that we won't be friends?
Nah.
Why would you say that?
No, I'm just saying, 'cause  things happen, like  Like what things?
Like, what if after college,  you get a little bit depressed,  and I'm a little irresponsible,  and we're both just so super dependent  on each other, and I  can't take it anymore.
And we don't laugh like we used to?
Or, like, the things  that we didn't think  would bother us about each other.
Or our parents.
Or the way we see the  world starts to eat at us,  and we just get, like, really cynical.
And really just, like, wake up one day  and we're not friends.
Or  - We share a dorm  - Mm-hmm.
- After school.

- I know.
- Literally.
And, like, after work, when we're older,  we're probably gonna, like,  walk together, like, every day.
Yeah, and we're gonna  have a double wedding.
Yeah.
And then we'll probably get  divorced at the same time.
'Cause they got in the way of us.
Yeah, and then we'll probably have kids,  like, a couple years apart,  so that you can help me raise mine.
'Cause I'm gonna have issues with it.
And we can live on the  same property, right?
Yeah.
And then when you get sick,  I'm gonna take you to  the doctor every day  because it's a block away, okay?
I'm gonna take you.
I will.
We're just gonna protect  each other from everything.
You promise?
And then there are gonna be clouds  that are, like, a  little lower in the sky,  - like, just around our house.
- Yeah.
And they're gonna be really, really soft  so we can just, like, hang out in them  and do, like, whatever, you know?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
And then, like, I'm gonna, like,  have the angels come down every Friday,  and they're gonna be, like,  "Hey, do you guys, like, want anything"?
And we're gonna be, like, "No".
'Cause we have each other.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, look!
That's when we met.
