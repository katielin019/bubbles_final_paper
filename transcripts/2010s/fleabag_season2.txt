Mum died three years ago.

What sculpture?

Thank you.
People make mistakes.
Your husband tried to kiss me on your birthday.

Great, thank you so much.

Oh, yes, I'll have the same.
Dream team.
You know the most fascinating thing about Father here, is that his mother was originally a lesbi!
You do look tired.
Oh, it's not as exhausting as I thought it would be, actually.
She's commuting from Finland.
She has narrowed down her packing to a ten-minute turnaround.
It's Fabulous!
It's all about Rolling it up, rather than Folding it.
I read about that.
Now, are you sure you don't want any wine?
Oh, no, thank you!
It really is delicious.
I admire you both so much.
Well, it's really turned us around, hasn't it, honey?
Oh, so much more energy.
You know, in Finland Is there a reason that you're not drinking?
He's an alcohol Oh, fun, my parents are alcoholics.
Oh, great.
We thought it'd be easier if we did it together, and I don't really like the taste And we are trying for a baby!
Oh, Claire!
We thought you couldn't have them!
What?
Why?
Well, you just seem a little Well, they say a lifestyle change can help, so here we go.
That is so exciting, darling.
Thanks, Dad.
Good luck.
That's wonderful.
Something's up.
And now you have the money to pay for proper Ghastly without help, I imagine.
Tell us about Finland.
Oh, well, it's, um ..
cold and beautiful and dark.
I think she might be happy.
It's a lot of pressure, but I love it.
I have this amazing new partner out there, he's really pushed the company forward I can't remember the last time we went away.
Weren't you both in Japan recently?
Japan, wow.
Oh, yes, but that was just a little fortnight.
/f Don't ask her!
Why were you in Japan?
Well, the I was Oh, sorry, darling.
Oh, no, no.
Thank you.
They flew us over with the Sexhibition.
Sorry, darling, do you want to?
No, no, no.
No?
Oh.
You see, you think of the Japanese as a very prudish people.
Not to generalise.
But actually they have a very deep interest in sex in their culture, it's just hidden in the underbelly.
It's not allowed to come to the surface.
Fair enough.
They really The honesty of the Sexhibition The Americans, oh, well Well, they just took me in their s But the Japanese were deeply moved by my work, I think.
Weren't they, darling?
Yeah.
It caused quite a cultural wave A ripple.
Wave.
No-one's asked me a question in 45 minutes.
So what do you d Er, I run a cafe.
Oh, wow.
It's going well, is it?
Yes, it is.
It really is.
It actually is.
It is.
Can I get anyone any ice?
Fellow smoker.
Do you have a spare one?
Sure.
So, do your family get together much, or?
Fuck you, then.
We should wait.
OK.
He's such a lovely man.
Yes.
Did you have a cigarette?
Yeah.
I just, I wish you could've seen him in You know, they can't even masturbate!
Shit alive, man.
Oh, sorry.
We were just saying, it's fascinating, the notion of a calling.
Yeah, well, marriage is a calling, too, of course.
Did you always want to join the priesthood?
Oh, fuck, no.
/fo Sorry.
No, no, no.
I came quite late to it, actually, but it's been a really good life to me.
I've really found peace in it.
Is anyone in your family in the Church?
Actually, both my parents are lawyers and my brother is a long-distance lorry driver.
How unusual!
Are your parents successful?
They were very successful alcoholics, yeah.
Better than you, anyway.
No, but beyond them, my family's literally crawling with nuns, so it wasn't too much of a leap.
Must be hard on the balls.
Martin!
Not as hard on them as trying to make a baby for five months, I imagine.
Food good?
This sauce is disgusting.
Is everything OK?
Oh, it's delicious, thank you.
Delicious.
Lovely, lovely.
Um, darling No, no.
We'll just pour our own wine, please.
Oh, I actually love doing Thank you.
You can pour me some.
Oh, thank you.
So, do you do a lot of older weddings?
I don't think that's how we No, this is my first-ever wedding, actually.
Oh!
Do you know, I've always been so suspicious of religion, but I must say, I think there's something rather chic about having a real priest at a wedding.
Are you a real priest?
Yeah.
Do you know, it's so nice spending time getting to know the man who's going to marry us.
Is that usual?
No, but I'm new to the parish, and I guess I'm just I'm really fucking lonely!
So I appreciate this.
Thank you very much.
New to the parish?
Father Patrick sadly died, so I got the gig.
What did he die of?
Just, um, time.
But he was a dedicated man, he was a brilliant priest.
Sounds like a riot.
He was, actually.
Do you know how we met?
No.
Through Jake.
Creepy step-son.
He plays the flute The bassoon.
..
in the church band.
Just adorable!
And Claire introduced us and we just hit it off.
Didn't we?
We did, yeah.
They did.
She's donating a painting for the fete, it's going to cause quite the stir!
Oh, it's just an old one.
Now, listen, um, we don't want gifts at the wedding.
I mean, it's enough that people slug it over without then expecting a gift.
So we've decided to ask people to make a small donation, to a charity of their choosing, in our name.
That sounds lovely.
Do you want to know what gift I'm giving your father?
Oh, Go It's a portrait Oh, God.
..
of you girls.
Oh, God.
Um You mean?
Together, or?
I'd only need a couple of sittings.
Right.
Can't you use photos?
No, because the lighting's never good enough, and if you're not very photogenic then it does you no favours.
And besides, the only photos there are of you two together are of when you were children, and you looked like a boy, so You never told me you had a sister, Claire.
Oh, well, we, um.
We don't get to see each other much.
Do you see your brother?
Oh, I don't really speak to my brother.
Oh, God, how desperately sad!
Why is that?
Oh.
Um, well You don't have to No, that's OK.
Does he not approve of what you do, of your choices?
No, it's not that, it's not that.
Is he not in the Church?
No, he's not in the Church.
Oh, it must be so hard!
Well, it's mainly hard Is it cos he's Mummy's favourite?
..
because he's a paedophile.
Oh.
I'm aware of the irony of that.
Just a Just a breath of air, eh?
Interesting man.
Mm.
No, thanks.
Darling, I'm sorry I missed your birthday, so I just got Oh, that's OK.
No, no.
I just In case you're struggling.
Oh, Dad, the cafe's going well No, no, this is not for work.
It's just for you.
Thanks.
You look, er ..
strong.
Thanks.
Are you?
Are we going to have a fight?
!
No, no!
I'm sorry, no.
I just want to check that ..
that you and I are Well, you're being very You're not being naughty.
No!
Why?
Oh Because, I guess Yeah?
..
it doesn't matter.
Oh.
OK.
Is that right?
I'm happy for you, Dad.
Thank you.
Ah!
Thank you.
You're an exceptional waitress.
Apple juice?
Yeah.
I I just wanted to say, I am so intrigued to see how you're going to make this whole evening about yourself.
Oh, no.
We probably shouldn't arrive at the table together.
A lot of people would say praying is just talking to yourself in the dark.
I guess it could look like that, but, no, it's more just about connecting with yourself at the end of each day.
It takes a bit of effort, but Yes, yes, I completely agree.
Positive energy takes work.
In the last six months, I've excelled.
I take all the negative emotions and just bottle them and bury them and they never come out.
I'm not sure I've basically never been better.
Us neither.
I feel fantastic!
You're a very positive family, I must say.
Oh, absolutely.
/ I think it's all about positivity.
It takes real commitment to be this happy.
It's not just about eating and drinking well, either.
Putting pine nuts on your salad doesn't make you a grown-up.
Fucking does.
It's about Well, in Finland, we, um They have this saying, which I can't quite remember now It's, um It's about opening yourself up to the people who want to love you.
And she is wide open lately.
What do you do?
Oh, I work in finance.
What?
What?
Across two firms, one in Finland and one here.
No, no, she's a lawyer.
I thought you were a lawyer?
No.
What?
I work with lawyers, I'm not a lawyer.
Darling, you are a solicitor.
I went to business school.
You're being so quiet!
Why aren't you saying anything?
What do you want me to say?
Anything!
What's that in your hand?
She doesn't need to Birthday present from Dad.
It's a good thing, Claire.
Chunk of change?
No, it's, er What is it?
Don't know.
You don't need to I love presents, I never get presents.
Well, it's because you might It's a voucher - for a counselling session.
Thanks, Dad.
So thoughtful!
I'd kill for one of those!
I don't believe you can pay your problems away, I think you have to face who you are and suffer the consequences.
It's the only road to happiness.
Maybe happiness isn't in what you believe but who you believe.
Fuck.
Excuse me.
Oh!
Do you think she needs anything?
No.
That was meant to be a bedroom present.
A what?
A present that you open in your bedroom, alone.
/font All my presents are bedroom presents, aren't they?
Do you want some more wine?
Oh, yes.
No, actually.
Claire?
You've been ages.
Are you pissed off or are you doing a poo?
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Claire, can we just Have you got a sanitary towel?
Oh, no, but I know a waitress who would jump on that request.
Do you want me to ask her?
No!
OK, well, there are some sturdy hand towels here.
I could try and fashion something with wings out of these.
Yes, fine.
Open the door.
Fuck, just give it Fuck!
Give it to me!
Don't come in!
It's a period!
It's not going to bite me!
Don't look at it!
I'm not looking at your period!
Just take this.
Oh, God.
It's not a period, it's a fucking miscarriage, OK?
Jesus, Claire!
It's OK.
No, it's not OK, you need to go to a hospital!
/fo It's fine, I just need the Let me just No!
Just get your hands off my miscarriage!
It's mine.
It's mine.
OK.
Claire.
It's OK.
It's OK.
OK, we need to go to a hospital now.
Now.
Yes.
Come on.
It's all good.
OK.
Don't tell anyone.
OK.
Let's get the coats, I'll get a taxi.
I'll tell them I don't feel right.
OK.
Thank you.

I still haven't gone.
Oh, really?
It'd be a wonderful place to buy things like that.
Yeah.
/fo I don't like all the water Fuck it, I'm having some.
Sorry, darling.

Wow!

Shall I get another bottle?
Yes!

I've always wanted to go there.
Top of my list.
It's great.
Yeah, I know Oh, for fuck's sake, stop it!
Are you OK?
Yeah, I'm, er Er Is, um Is it?
No, I'm sorry, I just Here we go.
Sorry, I just What's happened?
Nothing's happened.
What's happened?
/fon Something's happened.
Come on!
Come on!
Well, spit it out.
I just had a little Just say it.
I just a little I just What, darling?
I had a little miscarriage.
Oh, my God.
What?
Um What the fuck?
Er How far gone were you?
You should go to the hospital.
Whose was it?
Maybe leave that for later.
Was it the tooth man?
Hospital, n What about the bill?
Sit down.
No, I'll cover her, I'll cover you.
She doesn't want to go!
Why?
!
Cos I'm stubborn, and for some inexplicable reason I'd rather stay here and have a passive-aggressive party, so.
How far gone were you?
It was VERY early stages.
You knew?
I really think she should see a doctor.
Yeah, so do I. I thought you hadn't spoken?
She's fine.
She's absolutely fine!
Drink.
If it's gone, it's gone!
Claire What if it's not gone?
It's gone.
Darling Probably ectopic.
Awful.
I'll pay you back.
Do you need someone to go with you?
No, I think I'll just deal with this in my own insane, irrational, anal way, if that's OK.
That's probably for the best.
What did you say?
Ignore him, he's been drinking.
What?
You know, it's like a goldfish out the bowl, sort of thing.
If it didn't want to be in there, it didn't want to be in there - something wasn't right.
What?
It's the kid's choice if it wants to jump ship, right?
Now, Martin, just Either way ..

Your baby.
Oh!
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, I Thank you.
Is the father all right?
Well, he doesn't really exist.
I understand.
The funeral liturgy says that life is changed, not ended.
I've always loved that, if that's of any help.
Oh, well, thank you very much, but I really am an atheist.
Yeah, I gathered that by the smelling of the Bible.
New sermon?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's I write, uh restaurant reviews for the parish magazine and I was just finishing up the last one.
I actually just came up with a really good title.
Ah, what is it?
- No.
- What?
- No, it's not cool.
- Well, neither are we, so "I'd spend 40 days and 40 nights in that dessert".
Oh, God, I fancy a priest.
There you go.
Hey.
Are you having an event?
No.
Why are there so many people here?
Well, it's just successful, I guess.
Why is everyone talking to each other?
Oh, it's Chatty Wednesday.
If you buy something, you have to have a chat - with someone you don't know.
- What?
Loneliness pays.
Listen, can we Sure.
- I know you and I haven't - Have you had a check-up?
Yes, it's fine.
It's really not a big deal.

I'm so sorry.
Does Martin know?
You're not supposed to tell anyone for the first 12 - Well, you can tell the father.
- I just haven't told him.
- Okay, but what does he know?
- I don't want to talk about it, okay?
And I never want anyone to know about it.
You have it.
You're better at dealing with awful things anyway.
- I don't want it.
- Well, you took it, now everyone thinks you have it, so you have it.
What?
They're some pretty funky trainers.
I said I'm fine.
I just really, really don't want anyone to make a big deal out of this, okay?
Brutal.
Just brutal.
You must feel rotten.
Do you feel rotten?
I'd rather not talk about it if that's okay.
Of course, darling.
Come on up.
Claire get the door, for God's sake.
Did you know who the father was?
Um, you know, I'd rather not talk about it if that's okay.
No, of course, darling.
I've got a set up I'm very excited about.
- It's going to be very striking.
- Cool.
So, Claire, if you just sit here.
That's lovely And, darling, just beside her like that.

Actually, if you could just That's it, that's it.
Just a bit.
Bit more.

Gorgeous, yes.
Sorry, no, if you could just That's it.
Thank you, darling.
- So, um - She can't not talk about it.
- You know, I have six friends - A lie.
who've had miscarriages.
Five of them never managed to produce a child afterwards, but the sixth one did and rather regretted it, so I think you've probably done the right thing.
Thank you.
Did you never want them?
Oh, I'm still thinking about it.
Is Dad here?
I texted him, but - Oh, I saw that.
- Oh, so he is here?
Sorry, no, I've got his phone today.
I love that colour.
Which one?
- That one.
- Oh, that's three colours.
Right.
I'm getting rid of it.
But it was quite an adventure painting.
I had an orgasm as I finished it.
Well, let's hope we all get as much pleasure out of this one.
-  - No, no.
Could you?
Um, I have a pretty full afternoon, so Oh, have you got to go back to Finland again?
No, Finland are coming here.
Oh.
Well, that's easier for you.
Mmm.
Are you still okay to pick up the invitations?
Oh, yes, of course.
And did you find that ribbon thing for the flowers?
- Yes.
- Great.
And is Martin's nose on the mend?
Yes.
And how's the bassoon solo coming on?
-  - Oh, yes, he's practising.
- Oh, God, and now I just have to - What?
Sorry, Claire, can you look up, please?
Thank you.
Organise canapes for an awards ceremony.
Oh, gosh, you must be exhausted.
Does the little cafe do canapes?
It totally could, yeah.
Well, there you are.
That's one off the list.
Great.
Gosh, haven't you got a lovely, thick neck?
- That was fun.
- Thank you.
I really can help with the canapes if it's - I'm going to say this quickly.
Okay?
- Okay.
Martin wants to press charges against you for assault.
I've tried to talk him down, but to be fair, you did hit him - fucking hard.
- What?
!
I will provide you with exceptional legal advice as long as you don't tell anyone I'm providing you with exceptional legal advice.
- What?
!
- This is happening.
I am mortified, but it is happening, okay?
I will hire this lawyer to scare him off and I will hire you to do the canapes.
- Who's the lawyer?
- Oh, he's a friend.
He mainly defends rapists.
He has a high success rate then.
- Undefeated.
Come on.
-  I've filled him in with the basics.
- That your husband's an animal?
- Be serious.
Just do whatever he says and don't flirt with him.
I'm not going to f Fucking hell, okay.
- Claire!
- David, thank you so much - Oh!
Sorry.
- Wow.
I can take you to court for that.
This the little trouble maker, then?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Now, listen, I just want to be clear that whatever happens, I don't sleep with people I work with, okay?
I'm joking.
Slip on in, ladies.
Well, if you spit guilty, you'll have to swallow a short jail term, or community service if you're lucky.
Or?
- You definitely started it?
- Yes.
- Any witnesses?
- About 30.
The most important thing, honey, is that you do not, under any circumstances, apologise.
- I can do that - No, that's not what we discussed.
Well, that can be taken as an admission of guilt.
I assume you know the victim personally?
- Yes - No, and let's not call him - the victim yet, shall we?
- Well, that's what he is.
Yes.
Right.
They've definitely fucked.
We just want a letter to scare him off if he ends up seeking proper action.
- Really doesn't make sense, Claire.
- Actually maybe not.
I think it makes perfect sense.
- I just want to be ahead of the game.
- God, I can't tell.
- That's a habit of yours, I've heard.
- Oh, I've got it.
- Is it?
- They haven't You're going to have to tell me who said that.
- Never.
- but they're going to.
- David.
- Oh, God, I've got to get out.
- Claire.
- Excuse me.
Where you off to, little lady?
I'm just going to let this Yeah.
You all right?
Yeah.
Just thought I'd leave you to it.
- Sorry.
- What?
He says he'll only talk you through potential proceedings - if you go for a drink with him.
- What?
- I know.
- Outrageous.
- Stop smiling.
- I thought he was after you?
So did I, but my hair isn't great at the moment.
Either way, it's very inappropriate.
- Don't sleep with him.
- I won't.
- Don't.
- I won't.
I don't do that anymore.
What?
Why?
Are you ill?
- No.
- Then what?
Well, I just Oh, my God.
Have you met someone?
Well, not really.
- Back with Harry?
- No, it's actually - Someone new?
- Well - Is he single?
- Sort of.
Take this.
I'll try talk Martin down, but call him if you need him.
He's a very good lawyer.
Surprisingly tender underneath it all.
Knew it.
What you did in the restaurant was unforgiveable.
I know.
Thank you.
Okay, well Listen, I actually just wanted to give you this.
It's just one session, but you've been through a lot, so I just Oh, my God, I said I'm fine.
I'm weirdly fine.
I'd rather have the money.
Excuse me, I've got dry forearms.
Sure.
So, why have you come to the session?
Oh, it was a birthday present from my father.
Is that a joke?
No.
It would be good not to make jokes in here.
Just in case anything gets lost in humorous translation.
Oh, I don't know if I can do that.
Is that a joke?
No.
Oh, just try not to, or make it very obvious.
Sure.
So, why do you think your father suggested you come for counselling?
I think because my mother died and he can't talk about it and my sister and I didn't speak for a year because she thinks I tried to sleep with her husband and because I spent most of my adult life using sex to deflect from the screaming void inside my empty heart.
I'm good at this.
Although I don't really do that any more.
You close with your family?
We get on with it.
- Do you talk?
- God no!
Any friends?
- Sorry?
- Any friends?
Um No, I don't really have time for Well, I have a guinea pig, but she blows hot and cold.
Not a joke.
Tell me about the sex.
All of it?
You said you don't do that now.
Oh, no, I just play tennis now.
Tough crowd.
Sorry.
I just Sex didn't bring anything good, so I'm trying not to But I've And what have you found in your abstinence?
Well, I'm very horny and your little scarf isn't helping.
So, the impulse is still there?
Oh Yeah, the impulse is The impulse is very much still there.
It's just never the right person.
Mm.
So there is a particular person you're not having sex with?
No!
Well, look, nothing's happened.
I just He's not available.
- In a relationship?
- Yes, a bad one.
Oh, really?
How so?
It's a sort of relationship where one partner - tells the other how to dress.
- Are you in love with him?
No!
Why do you find that funny?
Well, I I dunno, I just I don't No!
- Just not a romantic?
- No.
Just a girl with no friends and an empty heart?
By your own description.
I have friends.
Oh, so you do have someone to talk to.
Yeah.
Do you see them a lot?
Oh, they're they're always there.
They're They're always there.
Why do you find that funny?
Listen, I don't need to be analysed.
I have a nice life.
I just I just wanted to exchange the voucher for the money.
It's a bit late for that now.
I've only been here five minutes.
I want the money.
I want to fuck a priest.
- Catholic?
- Yes!
- A good one?
- Yes!
- Looks good in the - Mmm, yes.
I understand.
Do you really want to fuck the priest, or do you want to fuck God?
- Can you fuck God?
- Oh, yes.
Look just please tell me how to not fuck a priest, before I get arrested.
Well, I don't think fucking a priest will make you feel as powerful - as you think it will.
- Can you just tell me what to do?
You know.
You already know what you're going to do.
Everybody does.
What?
!
You've already decided what you're going to do.
So what's the point in you?
You know what you're going to do.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.
- I don't!
- You do!
- I don't!
I don't - You do!
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

You had a big part in that.
I'm happy for you.
I'm happy you've found a way to deflect from your pitiful, self-sabotaging, ego-driven, masturbatory I cannot believe how well this is coming out.
pawing, insidious, insidious, overwhelming mediocrity, only to finally figure out that at your very core, you are a weaky.
Damn!
- A "weaky"?

Wow.
A "weaky"?
In that case, I just wanted you to know that I'm impressed with how you just keep bouncing back.

- Thank you.
- Knuckle brush.
Also, I hope you don't mind, but, um I've marked a few pages in here that I thought might be - Ooh, eh.

Well, you can.
Oh, Belinda's coming.
Don't speak to Belinda.

And another extraordinary woman Klare Korhonen.
Sorry, I think there's been a mistake, here.
Elizabeth Sawkin.
Congratulations to you all.
Have a wonderful evening.
We'll be presenting the award very soon.
I'm going to introduce Sylvia, who's going to introduce Belinda.
When you hear me introducing Sylvia, get her on stage.

Claire, your brain is somewhere else right now.
Sylvia, go!
Sylvia!
Crap.
A huge thanks to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John for coming up with this award.
And to LinkedIn for connecting us all this evening and beyond.
I am so excited to introduce Sylvia Hamburg, this year's winner of Women Who Work, who will announce this year's Best Woman in Business.
Sylvia.
What a legend!
I'll do it!
I can do it.
I'm sorry, it appears that Sylvia is busy, which shouldn't come as a surprise, really.
I-It's been a big year for business particularly women in business.
Men have been pretty hands-on the past few decades.
I'd like to thank all the brilliant men and women for supporting each other here at Hurbots.
We're a family, really.
And if we've learned anything during the past 12 months, it's that family really shouldn't touch each other up next to the photocopier.
I am honoured to present this award to this year's Best Woman in Business Belinda Friers.
Fuck's sake!
Thank you, thank you.
Well, um Well, I was going to say this is a bit on the nose, - but she doesn't seem to have one.
-  - What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.
It's not fine.
I awarded her with a pair of tits.
- Chase her down.
- Chase her down?
It's a stolen piece of art.
I will deal with the photographer.
Claire!
Oh, my God!
You were brilliant!
Thank you, Klare.
I love the joke.
Oh, well, I didn't think it was that funny.
- Can you go, my love?
!
- I'm just going to - Take the stairs.
- Okay.
I'm trained in martial arts.
It's just the basics, but it is enough.
- I work at Harbots.
- Hurbots.
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.
- Yeah, it was delicious.
- Thank you.
What do you want?
That.
I need to take your award back.
Why?
It's a stolen piece of art.
It's not really an award.
It's all my fault.
I can explain.
Is it a long story?
Sort of.
And she still doesn't know you have it?
That's glorious!
I think you did exactly the right thing.
I think you're the only person who thinks that.
God!
Women's awards.
Congratulations.
Oh!
It's infantilising bollocks.
What?
Don't you think it's good that?
No, no, it's ghettoising.
It's a subsection of success.
Ah, it's a fucking children's table of awards.
Why did you go?
Because I'd be an arsehole not to.
Miss Friers.
Thank you, darling.
Gosh, she's hot.
Yeah.
Are you a lesbian?
Not strictly.
- You?
- Mm.
- Do you like old films?
- Some.
And what's your favourite period film?
Carrie.
God!
God, you are a tonic.
What do you do?
Are you a woman in business?
- I run a cafe.
- Oh!
Good for you.
Did you make the canapes?
No, actually.
I stole them.
- How old are you?
- 58.
- And you?
- 33.
Oh.
- Don't worry.
It does get better.
- Do you promise?
I promise.
Listen, I was in an aeroplane the other day and I realised Well, I I mean, I've been longing to say this out loud.
Women are born with pain built in.
It's our physical destiny.
Period pains, sore boobs, childbirth, you know.
We carry it within ourselves throughout our lives.
Men don't.
They have to seek it out.
They invent all these gods and demons and things just so they can feel guilty about things, which is something we also do very well on our own.
And then they create wars, so they can feel things and touch each other, and when there aren't any wars they can play rugby.
And we have it all going on in here, inside.
We have pain on a cycle for years and years and years and then, just when you feel you are making peace with it all, what happens?
The menopause comes.
The fucking menopause comes and it is the most most wonderful fucking thing in the world!
And, yes, your entire pelvic floor crumbles and you get fucking hot and no-one cares, but then you're free.
No longer a slave, no longer a machine, with parts.
You're just a person in business.
Oh.
I was told it was horrendous.
It is horrendous, but then it's magnificent.
Something to look forward to.
You better get back to that party.
- Your party.
- Mm.
It is not a party until someone flirts with you.
And that's the only really shit thing about getting older, is that people don't flirt with you anymore.
Not really.
Not with danger.
I miss walking into a room and not knowing, and there's a sort of energy, a dare.
Do not take that for granted.
There is nothing more exciting than a room full of people.
Yeah, except most people are What?
shit.
Look at me.
Listen.
People are all we've got.
People are all we've got.
So grab the night by its nipples and go and flirt with someone.
No, that's not what I meant!
Oh.
I wish you were my type.
Take this tart back to my party and go and find someone to actually do that with.
- I want to do it with you.
- No.
- Why not?
- Honestly?
Yeah.
I can't be arsed, darling.
I'm going to go back to my room and have one more martini, and if you need anything, call me.
Anything.
You can have whoever you want at your age.
Except the Best Woman in Business.
Well, that's just because she's exhausted.
33 isn't exactly And what had Jesus done by 33?
- Died?
- Exactly!
So get out there and flirt.
- Here you are!
- Oh, hi!
Thought you might be snogging Finland.
Ha-ha!
No, just sorting a few things!
I got her!
Oh!
And Belinda gave me her card.
Oh, that's great!
- What?
- Nothing.
She's furious.
Really?
Yes!
It was a great night.
Everything went smoothly in the end, and everyone loved the canapes.
Really?
I'm a dead woman.
- Really?
- Yes!
Really?
Yes!
It was a great night.
She's going to blow.
I just have a feeling I would've come up with my own joke if you hadn't put that one in my head.
I have my own jokes.
I am funny, I am interesting.
I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
- What do you mean, interesting?
- You just think you can do whatever you like, say whatever you like, steal whatever you like, - kiss whoever you like.
- He kissed me!
Oh, I know.
You know?
!
Then why have we been spending - the entire?
- Because you're fine!
You'll always be fine.
You'll always be interesting, with your quirky cafe and your dead best friend.
You just make me feel like I've failed.
Claire If you mention the size of my office, I will scream.
: It's huge.
I just thought we were hanging out.
Just as friends.
We're not friends.
We are sisters.
Get your own friends.
Oh.
Hi.
Oh, sorry.
I didn't have your number and you just said come round any time with G&Ts.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
I just This is a bit embarrassing, but recently I've been really enjoying going to bed at 9:30.
- Oh, shit.
- No, no, it's fine.
I can see G&Ts!
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I just Just fancied a drink and a priest and a chat, maybe.
Oh, that's my whole job.
We'll have to be quiet, though, because Pam's a bit of a sound tyrant in the evenings.
- Pam lives here?
- Yeah, Pam lives here.
- So I read your book.
- Okay.
Great.
Well, it's got some great twists.
- True.
- But I just - I couldn't help but notice - Come on, just spit it out!
- just one or two little inconsistences.
- Okay, sure.
So, the world was made in seven days.
And on the first day, light came and then a few days later the sun came?
Yeah, that's ridiculous.
But you believe that?
It's not a fact, it's poetry.
It's moral code.
It's for interpretation to help us work out God's plan for us.
What's God's plan for you?
I believe God meant for me to love people in a different way.
I believe I'm supposed to love people as a father.
We can arrange that.
A father of many.
I'll go up to three.
- It's not going to happen.
- Two, then.
Okay, two.
-  - Oh, shit.
Pam.
She's not happy.
: We should go outside.
Do you think I should become a Catholic?
No, don't do that.
I like that you believe in a meaningless existence.
And you're good for me.
You make me question my faith.
- And?
- I've never felt closer to God.
Fuck you!
-  - What was that?
It wasn't a fox, was it?
- I don't know.
- Is it a fox?
Shine something.
Boo!
Baa!
- Oh, God.
I bet it's a fox.
- Oh, God!
No, I'm not being funny, foxes have been after me for years.
It's like they have a pact or something.
I'm not kidding.
I was on a toilet, a toilet of a train, and when the train stopped, a fucking fox tried to get through the window of a train!
Its face was in the window!
And once, when I was at a monastery, I woke up just feeling a bit weird, like there might be a fox about, and a fox was sitting underneath my window looking up like this, pointing at me like, "You, we're watching you.
We're having you".
Lucky God got there first.
- Well, yeah.
- You could be a fox boy by now.
And we all know what happened to them!
- You okay?
- I'm okay.
Do you think I'm mad?
Because of the fox thing or because of the God thing?
You're obsessed.
Do you ever have doubts?
Yes, of course, every day.
It's part of the deal.
I just don't think I could do it.
Especially the What?
- celibacy and - Oh, it's a fucking fox!
-  - Chill out about the fox!
Ooh!
Sorry.
I just don't know what they want from me!
Sorry.
Celibacy.
Go.
I just I couldn't give up sex forever.
It's just too It's too Celibacy is a lot less complicated than romantic relationships.
What if you meet someone you like?
I talk and drink and laugh and give them Bibles, and hope they eventually leave me alone.
What if you meet someone you love?
We're not going to have sex.
I know that's what you think you want from me, but it's not.
It won't bring any good.
- Well, it might - It won't.
I've been there many times.
Before I found this.
Many, many times.
How many times?
Many.
I'd really like to be your friend, though.
I'd like to be your friend, too.
We'll last a week.
What was that?
What?
Where did?
Where did you just go?
What?
You just went somewhere.
There.
There.
Where did you just go?
Nowhere.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 Mum died three years ago.
She had a double mastectomy, but never really recovered.
So why do you think your father suggested you come for counselling?
Because my mother died and he can't talk about it.
- Thanks, Dad.
- Get your hands off my miscarriage!
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- What?
- Your baby.
- Oh.
So, there is a particular person you're not having sex with?
He's not available.
I believe God meant for me to love people as a father.
I'll go up to three.
No-one's asked me a question in 45 minutes So, what do you do?
You'll always be interesting with your quirky cafe and your dead best friend.
Celibacy is a lot less complicated than romantic relationships.
But what if you meet someone you like?
I talk and drink and laugh and give them Bibles and hope they eventually leave me alone.
What if you meet someone you love?
We're not going to have sex.
I'd really like to be your friend, though.
I'd like to be your friend too.
What makes you a normal person?
Well, I don't believe in God I love it when he does that.
I don't know.
Just come out.
- I prefer the last one.
- Me too.
- It's a bit more subtle.
- Elegant, yeah.
- It's these bits, isn't it?
- Yep.
- Yep, last one, definitely.
- Yep.
Great.
- Really pleased with that!
- Yeah.
- Once it's nipped in there - Oh, it'll be perfect.
His arms.
- Do you prefer weddings or funerals?
- Weddings.
His arms.
I think there's something humbling about funerals.
Really?
Yeah, it's good to dwell on the next life.
You really think there's a next life?
What do you believe?
Worm food?
- Why?
!
- Why what?
His neck.
Why would you believe in something awful when you could believe in something wonderful?
Don't make me an optimist, you will ruin my life.
- Have you been to many funerals?
- A couple.
His neck.
And you've never felt them go somewhere?
No, they were already gone.
His beautiful neck.
What?
What?
You just said, "His beautiful neck".
No, I said that they'd already gone.
Okay.
Weird.
Oh, right, so This might be your idea of hell but I think it's kind of special.
His beautiful neck.
Quaker meeting.
You're not allowed to speak.
If the Spirit moves you to speak, you have to stand up and share it with everyone.
It's very intense.
It's very quiet.
It's very, very erotic.
Oh.
I think I'm going to go home in November.
I think.
What's he thinking?
What's he thinking?
I don't really think it's I'm not really feeling the I don't think it's really affecting me Oh, my Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
What am I going to say?
What am I going to say?
I sometimes worry that I wouldn't be such a feminist if I had bigger tits.
- Well, it's good you felt something.
- Is it?
Something moved you.
I'm not sure I needed to me moved to discover that about myself.
What were you thinking?
I was thinking about how peaceful I felt and then for some reason, I was thinking about your tits, which kind of ruined it.
- Oh, my tits ruined your peace?
- Yeah.
You could say that.
- I should probably open the cafe - I've got a confession actually - Oh, can I see it?
- Uh Oh, yeah It's a bit What?
- It's a bit - What the fuck?
Hello.
Oh, you gorgeous little thing.
Can I ask, um, why so many guinea pigs?
Oh, um I just, um This is an excellent one.
I just thought it'd be a unique selling point.
Yeah.
Which came first, the guinea pig or the guinea pig cafe?
That is a big, old question.
Fair enough.
What do guinea pigs do?
They are born, they shit themselves with fear and then they die.
Can I use that at the wedding?
Seriously, I need material.
Tell me about your stepmother-to-be.
Any What's she like?
Oh, she's, um - she's from Exeter.
- Mm.
Okay, thank you, that's very helpful.
- How did she meet your dad?
- Through my mother.
Right.
She was my mother's student at one point.
- Do your parents get on?
- No.
- Were you close to your mum?
- Yeah.
You?
Not really.

I don't really think about it.
- So, you run No, no.

What?
No.
No, I didn't mean Oh, I know what you mean, Father.
Thank you so much for your guidance.
Come on, I didn't mean I really should get back to work.
A customer's bound to turn up any minute.
And you should be getting back to God, don't you think?
I think you played with my guinea pig long enough.
Okay.
All right, bye.
Sorry, girls.
People are starting to arrive.
She was a spectacular woman.

We're trying to mess her up.
No matter what I do to my hair, it just keeps falling in this really chic way.

I was on the verge of having a little prayer, actually.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't, don't you That's my thing.
What were you praying about?
Please say you were praying for me.
I could do with the extra pair of hands.
Mine don't seem to have the fucking reach any more.
God help me!
Whoa!
- Thank you.
-  Do you know there was a man who wanted to be a saint so badly he castrated himself just to stop himself?
You know whack!
Wow!
Here's to peace.
And those who get in the way of it.
I'm sorry about today.
Forget it.
Look at this.
Look at it.
That's the first one I ever got.
Went all the way to Rome for that.
Such a nerd!
Two years before I was even allowed to wear it, but I just I couldn't wait.
I couldn't wait!
I knew I wanted a bold, you know, this colour, but proper plum.
You can only get proper plum in Italy.
Sometimes I worry I'm only in it for the outfits.
So beautiful, isn't it?
I mean, your stuff is lovely, too.
What were you praying about?
You don't like answering questions, do you?
Okay.
Come with me.
I know what to do with you.
You go in there, I go in there.
And you make me tell you all my secrets so you can ultimately trap and control me?
- Yeah.
No.
-  You tell me what's weighing on your heart and I listen without judgment - and in complete confidence.
- Sounds dodgy!
I just listen.
At the very least it'll shut me up for a minute.
- I'm not Catholic.
- Tonight, that doesn't matter.
Won't I catch fire or something?
If you did, it would confirm my faith, so let's try it.
Go on.
Go on.
All right.
Okay, now you say, "Bless me father for I have sinned".
- I'm not going to say that!
- Well, very good.
"It's been" Uh, enter days, years, months - "since my last confession".
- Mm-hmm.
Then I say, "That's okay, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah", till you tell me what's on your mind.
Tell me your ssss - Sins.
- Sins, if you want.
- Why would I tell you my sins?
- Because it will make you feel better!
And because I want to know.
Okay.
I lied.
Okay.
To you.
- About?
- About the miscarriage.
I was just covering for my sister who actually had the miscarriage, because her husband didn't know she was pregnant, and it just Okay.
Keep going.
And I've stolen things.
I've had a lot of sex outside of marriage.
And once or twice inside someone else's.
And there's been a spot of sodomy.
Um, there's been much masturbation, a bit of violence, and of course the endless fucking blasphemy.
And?
And - Go on.
- And I I can't It's okay, go on.
- Frightened.
- Of what?
Forgetting things.
People.
Forgetting people.
And I'm ashamed of not knowing what I What you want?
It's okay not to know what you want.
No, I know what I want.
I know exactly what I want right now.
What's that?
It's bad.
It's okay.
I want someone to tell me what to wear in the morning.
Okay, well, I think there are people who can No, I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning.
I want someone to tell me what to eat, what to like, what to hate, what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about.
I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them.
I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father, because so far I think I've been getting it wrong.
And I know that's why people want people like you in their lives.
Because you just tell them how to do it.
You just tell them what to do, and what they'll get out of the end of it.
Even though I don't believe your bullshit, and I know that scientifically nothing I do makes any difference in the end anyway, I'm still scared!
Why am I still scared?
!
So just tell me what to do.
Just fucking tell me what to do, Father!
Kneel.
What?
Kneel.
Just kneel.
- Is this a skirt and trousers?
- Sorry, sorry.

I think there's something rather chic about having - a real priest at a wedding.
- Why is everyone talking to each other?
Oh, it's Chatty Wednesday.
Hi, Jake.
Oh!
Tell her to leave him.
We are trying for a baby.
This the little troublemaker, then?
He says he'll only talk you through potential proceedings, - if you go for a drink with him.
- Claire!
Oh!
Hi.
Oh!
So, how do you two know each other?
Oh, we are partners.
Are you in love with him?
I spent most of my adult life using sex to deflect from the screaming void inside my empty heart.
- Don't sleep with him.
- I won't.
- Don't.
- I won't!
I don't do that any more.
I thought I wouldn't see you again unless you were in trouble.
Oh!
I am in trouble!
Ohh!
You mean this kind of trouble.
Isn't he great?
He's so great.
He's funny, he makes jokes.
She turned around and it was the golden one!
You, sort of, needed to hear the top bit.
- I love word play.
- Oh, he's clever.
Shakespeare uses word play.
- He says things like - I've got a big case tomorrow.
He's a little bit controlling.
- Don't eat that.
- But it's manageable.
- I'm going to.
- Okay.
- He's a feminist.
- I have a sister.
- He's unpredictable.
- I'm just going to go for a shit.
I'm ignoring that.
Actually you want to go and have sex?
- That's better.

A serious one.

- Is this what you asked for?
- No, of course not!
He's just a bastard.
Right, fuck it.
- What?
!
- Come on!
No, no!
It's All right!
Come on!
Slow down!
Hey!
- No!
- Anthony.
No!
That is exactly what she asked for.
No, it's not!
We want compensation.
- Claire?
- I've got two important meetings and I look like a pencil.
No!
Don't blame me for your bad choices.
Hair isn't everything.
Wow!
What?
Hair is everything.
We wish it wasn't, so we could actually think about something else occasionally, but it is.
It's the difference between a good day and a bad day.
We're meant to think that it's a symbol of power, that it's a symbol of fertility.
Some people are exploited for it and it pays your fucking bills!
Hair is everything, Anthony.
Show her the reference.
Claudia bring me the bin.
If you want to change your life, change your life.
It's not going to happen in here.
Sorry, Anthony.
- I didn't mean to turn up.
- See you next week.
You got any cigarettes?
- No.
- Good.
- Thank you for being there.
- It was cathartic.
At the hospital.
Oh, it's okay.
Shame you didn't get to keep that doctor.
I'm sorry you lost it.
I just felt relief.
I didn't want my husband's baby.
Isn't that awful?
I haven't even asked you how you are?
How are you?
What's going on with you?
Um I met someone.
- What?
Really?
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, that's amazing!
What does he do?
He's a priest.
Is it?
Yep.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
- You are joking?
- No.
- I'm sorry.
- I know.
It's just, I'm sure it's very complicated.
- Yes!
It's very painful.
- But it, it's just you're a genius.
You're my fucking hero.
Claire?
Is that you?
Oh, God.
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
- Claire!
- Klare!
- Hi!
- Oh, my God, Claire, - I love your hair!
- Oh!
Claire, it's so cute and edgy and cool.
- Oh, thank you.
- Like superstar, pop star.
-  -  Listen, these penguins are taking me to this new amazing London music thing.
- Are you free?
- Yes.
- You want to come?
- Oh, I I have to take my step-son his bassoon.
I mean, I wish I could.
Well, I leave tomorrow.
So Oh.
I'll take the bassoon.
I've got it.
I'll take it.
Oh, um No, he's expecting me to.
No, no.
No, just, just tell Jake it's with me at the cafe.
- Honestly, it's fine.
- Oh.
Hey, I don't want to get in the way of your family day.
No, I'll take it.
Please, get in the way of her family days.
Just tell Jake I've got it.
No biggie.
Bye, Claire.
Bye, Klare.
Bye, Claire.
I can't believe your hair!
It's so chic and cute!
It's all the things!
- Really?
-  Goes so well with your top.
My, God, that's so sweet of you.
Honestly, I've had such a day with it.
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.
Oh, fuck!
Sorry!
Well, that was exhausting.
- The new guinea pig - Hamster.
is in with Hillary.
They shared the cucumber okay, which was quite sweet.
Thanks.
Well, I'd say any time but, uh You have a new job.
I will be back, though.
My wife would love Chatty Wednesdays.
- Love them.
- Ah.
Oh!
You have a visitor.
He said he knew you, so I let him wait in there.
Oh?
Oh.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Bye.
He took the pinny.
- Ugh.
- Hey!
He's going to make a bassoon joke.
Is that a bassoon in your hand or are you just pleased to see me?
Would you say that to your son?
When he has his bassoon, sure.
But he's never pleased to see me, so It doesn't even make sense.
Why would a bassoon in my hand Like a dick in your hand.
Oh, right so if I was walking towards you with an amputated dick in my hand you'd think I was horny.
Well, I'd assume that you had been.
Certainly wouldn't put it past you to chop a dick off.
Put the guinea pig down.
- Where is she?
- Why?
Well, she was meant to have dropped that off - and she's not at the office.
- Oh, I don't know where she is.
So, you just found that, huh?
Hm.
Please don't hurt the guinea pig.
I would never hurt the guinea pig.
-  - I wouldn't do that.
Here we go, sweetie.
Come on, here.
It's fucking adorable.
Are you sure we should even be talking?
Aren't you supposed to be getting me arrested or something?
Wow.
She really tells you everything, doesn't she, hm?
Cute tables.
- Ah, Jesus, Martin.
- Fuck off!
You are the problem, you know that?
You are the problem in my perfect, awful life.
I haven't seen you in a year.
And yet still off she runs, into the night, for you.
I can't even get the woman pregnant.
And then you come in showing off about your miscarriage, like you didn't even want the one you had.
I was just trying to make her feel better!
- Give me your phone.
- No.
Give me your phone.
No!
Is she leaving me?
I hope so.
Don't let her leave me.
Don't let her leave me, please.
I hope she doesn't come home tonight.
Ah!
Cashmere, cashmere, cashmere!
I will take you down, fucker.
I will take you down, fucker.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!
You better start sleeping with a lawyer!
I'm already sleeping with a lawyer!
Yeah, lucky lawyer!
Shit!
I'd better call my lawyer.
You know that feeling when the hot misogynist who might not be a misogynist is turning up at your house for the second time in 48 hours to give you nine orgasms you don't want, just to do something to get your head out of the fact the only person you want to see in the world is the priest that you -  -  So, you pick yourself up, cover yourself in coconut oil and hope he hasn't noticed that you haven't shaved your Hey.
Your sister gave me your address.
Are you on your way out?
Oh, no, I just I just got in.
I've only got underwear under this coat.
Okay.
Can I come in?
Yeah, sure.
- It's nice.
- Oh, thank you.
Uh Water?
No, thanks, I want to keep a clear head.
Uh, I've changed my mind about the wedding.
I can't let them down like that.
And apparently no-one else will wear the outfit.
Well, that's good of you.
- You gonna take off your coat, or?
- Oh no.
No, I'm good.
I'm a bit chilly.
I sacrificed a lot for this life.
You know?
I've given a lot of things up.
- Um, so that -  Do you want to get that?
Oh, no.
I don't like opening the door to people I don't know.
-  - I'm baaack!
Look if-if if-if there's someone you need to see or, or let in, or?
No, honestly, honestly, it's fine.
- When I was a child, I -  - Me lady?
!
- I'm just I'll just be, um, just So, you're in trouble again, huh?
Oh, my God, listen, you can't come in.
Okay!
You want to do it on the doorstep?
Uh, no.
My priest is here and he really needs some guidance.
What?
Is he okay?
No, I'm hoping he's having an emotional crisis.
Shall I wait?
You said you wanted to see me?
Yes, I did want to see you, but now I don't want to see you.
Did I do something wrong?
You seemed to like what I did?
I did.
- I'm really good at it.
- Yes, I know you are.
Yeah.
- I'm really good at it.
- Yeah, I know you are.
- I'm really - Yeah, yeah, you're really good at it.
Well, clearly, I'm not?

- Oh, for God's sake.
You're the best sex I've ever had.
- What?
- You're the best sex I've ever had.
Really?
Honestly, you you made me cum nine times.
Honestly?
Cool.
- Do you want me to go?
- Yeah.
- I could take this somewhere else.
- Okay, good.
Good for her.
Nine times.
You're a saint.
- I'm sorry that was - No, it's okay.
I won't ask.
Nine times?
- I just had to get rid of him.
- Sure.
I can't be physical with you.
What, we can't even wrestle?
Well, priests have sex, you know.
A lot of them actually do.
They don't burst into flames, I googled it.
I can't have sex with you, because I'll fall in love with you.
And if I fall in love with you, I won't burst into flames, but my life will be fucked.
We're going to have sex.
- I'm supposed to love one thing.
- Oh, my God, we're gonna have sex.
For fuck's sake!
Stop that!
I don't think you want to be told what to do at all.
I think you know exactly what you want to do.
If you really wanted to be told what to you do, you'd be wearing one of these.
Women aren't actually allowed to - Oh, fuck off, I know!
-  We're going to have sex, aren't we?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh!
Whoa!
Okay.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 Here's to love!
To love!
Congratulations, you assholes!
I don't need you to do anything, thank you.
- I just had a little - What?
What, darling?
miscarriage.
Unless you can find a way to stop this horrendous wedding.
You come in showing off about your miscarriage, like you didn't even want the one you had.
What was that?
It wasn't a fox, was it?
Hi!
Oh!
- How do you two know each other?
-  Oh, we are partners.
I didn't want my husband's baby.
It's like a goldfish out the bowl sort of thing.
Oh, my God, Claire, I love your hair!
If it didn't want to be in there, it didn't want to be in there.
Something wasn't right.
Uh, I've changed my mind about the wedding.
I can't let them down like that.
I leave tomorrow, so I can't have sex with you, because I'll fall in love with you.
And if I fall in love with you, I won't burst into flames, but my life will be fucked.
What?
Mm.
What are you thinking?
I just Come on.
- I just - Come on.
I just can't believe you did that.
I know.
- So good to see you!
- We're over the moon.
- Good to see you!
Who was that?
- Love the shirt.
- Is this the, um - Don't!
It'll come off.
Thank you.
What's happening with the priest?
- Oh, hi.
- Oh!
Nothing.
Ooooh!
So good of you to come and get me!
- Get you?
- See me!
- Hi, Jake.
- Where's Claire?
Just there.
- Your dad's just down there.
-  Nice skirts.
Do you need me to say anything emotional about today?
- No, no.
We're good.
- I think we're all right, thanks.
Do you want tequila?
I'm going to get one.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Nice to How was Klare?
Well, he's crazy about me.
- So, that's a nightmare.
- Nightmare.
He's back to Finland today, anyway, which is good.
- It's fine, it's totally fine.
- Sounds like it's fine.
It is.
It's going to be a lovely day, isn't it?
I'm afraid so.
This is my very interesting friend Daniel, who's deaf.
I picked him up at a student gallery opening.
Utterly fascinating.
Can't hear a thing, but is a fabulous physical communicator through hands and lips.
Oh, I love that!
And this is my extraordinary friend Francine, she's a lesbian.
And this is Asif, my bisexual, Syrian refugee friend, who you haven't actually met yet, darling.
And, Asif, this is, um Oh, my God.
This is this is God, how extraordinary.
I just, I always call you darling.
This is the love of my life!
Hi.
Is there somewhere I can put this?
We said no presents!
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.
She's a natural rule breaker.
Not today!
Ah, well I've been trying to get rid of it for ages.
Oh!
Thank you.
I'm going to open it over a bin, so I've got somewhere to put the paper.
Um, come with me!
Uh, are you short on staff or where, do you need me, or?
No, I just wondered if you had a little show planned?
- What?
- Well, you normally do.
And I wondered if there was anything I might need to know about, that might happen later?
No.
Good.
Well, let me know if you change your mind.
Because today is the most important day of my life and I love your father very much.
And I imagine you'd rather have me looking after him in the years to come than having to do it yourself.
So no more miscarriages.
It's worth a lot.
So Thank you.
I'll go and put her straight back on her shelf.
Do you know, I often thought it strange that of all my pieces you chose to take her.
Why?
She was based on your mother.
So nice to have her back in the house.
- Oh!
Oh, God.
Fuck, you're here.
- Oh, fuck!
Oh, Jesus.
I thought you were a fox.
You're not.
No, are you?
I didn't know you were No, no, I'm fine, sorry.
No, I just didn't want to, I'm practising the homily.
- How's it going?
- Not good, not good.
I can't, I can't You look lovely.
Thank you.
So do you.
Wait till you see me in the full shebang, you're going to lose your fucking mind.
We just need to get through this bit and then we can - We can - Yeah.
- Better get changed.
- Yeah, good luck.
Oh, my God.
What?
- You have lipstick all over - Oh, fucking hell.
That would not look good, has it gone?
Where?
Oh, fucking hell.
I don't know, I don't know Oh, I don't know what this feeling is.
Is it God or is it me?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Fuck you, then.
Where's your priest?
I don't know.
You okay?
Yes, well, um I hate my husband and the man I love is on his way to Finland, so pretty weird.
Oh!
Way to upstage the bride!
Tried my best.
Cute dress.
Oh, look.
Woooo!
This is our very chic priest.
Oh, good, I was aiming for chic.
- It's particularly good around the - Thank you.
- Father, you remember Martin.
- Hey, how you doing, man?
Bit nervous, Martin.
- And you know Jake.
- Yes, hello, Jake.
How are you?
And this is my very interesting friend Lucy, who is a surrogate.
- Hello.
- Oh, weird.
And this is my unstable step-daughter, who's had a miscarriage.
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.
But you knew that, you were there.
It was my miscarriage.
What?
It was my fucking miscarriage.
Yes, I thought you'd find that funny.
How interesting.
She was just covering for me.
What, we were pregnant?
- For a few weeks, yes.
- It was my baby?
Sorry, so you haven't had a miscarriage?
No, sorry.
Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
!
I-It was, it was my baby?
I guess it was your baby's way of saying it didn't want you as it's father.
Like a goldfish out of the bowl sort of thing.
Ohh!
Sorry, but whoever had a miscarriage, could you take it to the kitchen, please?
No!
Don't follow me, Jake.
Oh, and this is over.
You're leaving me.
- No, no, no.
- Yes!
Are you drunk?
- Yes.
- Are you sober?
A bit.
Could you just fuck off?
- Oh, absolutely not!
- Okay, no, no.
I'm staying right here.
I want you to leave me.
Listen to me, I just, I have I think he has a little speech.
I have a little speech that's building here.
Now, I know you look at me and you see a bad man with a big beard.
You are an alcoholic and you tried it on with my sister.
Fine.
I tried to kiss your sister on her birthday.
My birthday!
Fine!
I mix up birthdays and I have an alcohol problem, just like everyone else in this fucking country.
But I am here and I do things.
I pick up Jake up from shit, I make dessert for Easter, I organise the downstairs toilet, I fired the humming cleaner.
- You enjoyed that.
- I hoover the car.
I put up all your certificates and I don't make you feel guilty for not having sex with me.
I am not a bad guy!
I just have a bad personality, it's not my fault.
Some people are born with fucked personalities.
Look at Jake.
He is so creepy, it's not his fault!
Why the bassoon!
?
You want to know what the bassoon is!
?
It's a cry for help!
The main fucking problem here is that you don't like me.
And that has been breaking my fucking heart for 11 years.
I love you.
I make you laugh.
I'm a douche, but I make you laugh.
You said that that was the most important thing!
I think the thing that you hate the most about yourself is that you actually love me.
So, I am not going to leave you, until you are down on your knees begging me.
Please, leave me.
Oh, man.
I didn't think you'd do that in that dress.
Right.
Well I guess the only thing left for me to say is Fuck you.
Fuck you.
What have you done with him?
- Who?
- Your father.
The wedding is about the start and no-one can find him anywhere.
- Um - Can you do something?
Please.
Please.
Please!
- Garden.
- Upstairs.
Okay.
Dad?
Dad.
I can't get out.
Okay, Dad, you can.
I can't!
It's a trap.
I'm stuck.
- No, Dad - I just, there's nothing I can do.
everyone will understand.
Just give them all a bottle to take home.
Honestly, they, they'll be relieved.
My foot is stuck.
Oh.
Everyone will understand?
Um W-Will you help me, please?
- How is it stuck?
- J-Just help me get it out.
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
What are you doing up here?
I I just remembered that I'd left a a friendly mouse trap up here a few weeks ago and I hadn't checked it.
And I just wanted to make sure that one little chap hadn't got, uh, trapped in it and was, uh, was suffocating up here.
I think I've worked out what we need to do.
Let's Let's do it.
Do it.
Darling.
I'll do it if you tell me why you're up here.
Just one honest answer.
I What, what?
I, I don't think One full sentence.
I was checking on the mouse.
Dad?
Do you want to make a run for it?
I can smuggle you out - in one of mum's dresses.
- You would, as well.
Look, I-I know she's not everyone's cup of tea.
And neither are you, darling.
I mean, I'm sorry, I love you, but I'm not sure that I like you All the time.
Sorry.
Hey, you created this monster.
You're not the way you are because of me.
I know.
You're the way you are because of her.
And it's those bits that you need to cling to.
Right, can you get my shoe out?
I just want you all to be proud of me.
We are proud of you, Dad.
You have two daughters who love you, even if you don't like them.
I like Claire.
Jesus, Dad!
Thank you.
Okay.
Come on.
I-I don't think I can.
Come on.
Buck up.
Smiles, charm, off we go.
I think you know how to love better than any of us.
That's why you find it all so painful.
I don't find it painful.
They're there.
Okay, go, go, go, go.
Okay, Dad.
No, no, no.
Stay with me.
Stay.
Darling!
Oh, sorry.
-  - Good afternoon, everybody.
Thank you for coming today, to celebrate the love between these two very special people.
Before we start, uh, Jake has asked to play another piece on his bassoon.
I can't do this reading.
- Don't do it.
- What?
I'll do it.
- You go and get him.
- I can't go and get him.
- Why not?
- It's too late.
I can't leave my father's wedding.
He's called "Klare" for God's sake and he's already at the airport, anyway.
Well, there you go.
Is it running through the airport kind of love?
I'm not going to the airport.
- He'd think I was insane.
-  Yeah.
- I'm just saying - The airport.
How would I even find him?
You can't get through security without a boarding pass.
- No, I wasn't suggesting - I'd have to buy a dummy ticket just to get through the gate.
I don't know when his flight is or which terminal.
Imagine if I knew that.
Imagine him finding out I knew all that.
Imagine if he was just in Boots buying a pair of tweezers in Terminal 5 and suddenly I was there, "Hello, Klare".
Yeah, okay, that would be intense.
The only person I'd run through an airport for is you.
Thank you, Jake, for that beautiful bassoon piece.
Uh, written especially for today.
I believe it's called - "Where's Claire"?
-  I think what you guys are doing is amazing.
Sorry.
Oh!
Fuck me.
I'm sorry, didn't get much sleep last night.
So, it turns out it's quite hard to come up with something original to say about love.
But I've had a go.
Love is awful!
It's awful.
It's painful.
It's frightening.
Makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself.
Distance yourself from the other people in your life.
Make you selfish.
Makes you creepy!
Makes you obsessed with your hair.
Makes you cruel!
Makes you say and do things you never thought you would do!
There's something wrong with your priest.
It's all any of us want and it's hell when we get there!
So, no wonder it's something we don't want to do on our own.
I was taught if we're born with love, then life is about choosing the right place to put it.
People talk about that a lot.
It "feeling right".
"When it feels right it's easy".
But I'm not sure that's true.
It takes strength to know what's right.
And love isn't something that weak people do.
Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope.
I think what they mean is when you find somebody that you love it feels like hope.
Go out the side way, now.
So, thank you for bringing us all together here today.
To take words from this book of love, be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord.
Um, let's get on with the big bit.
Oh, there you are.
Hi.
Fuck it.
Thank you.
And thank you.
Oh, the, uh, the priest is looking for you.
Oh?
- Don't break his heart.
-  - Oh, thank you so much.
- Hiya.
- Oh, are you leaving?
- Oh, actually, well, I thought you were - I was changing.
- Oh, yeah.
What do you do?
Do you get the, get the bus or?
Yeah, I get the bus.
- On the road?
- Just on the road.
- I go on the bus.
- Cool.
- Well, bye, my daughter.
- Okay.
Bye, Father.
- Bye, Father.
-  - Goodbye.
- Bye.
- You nailed it.
-   They always lie, it'll magically come in a minute.
Yeah.
They're really into each other, those two, it's nice.
They really pulled it off.
Was your sister okay?
- She seemed a bit on edge.
- Yeah, she she had to run off - to a work thing.
- Wow, dedicated!
- Addicted.
-  It's God, isn't it?
Yeah.
- Damn.
-  Damn.
You know, the worst thing is that I fucking love you.
I love you.
No, no, don't.
No, let's just leave that out there just for a second on its own.
I love you.
It'll pass.
- This bus is not magically coming.
- I think I'll walk.
- Okay.
-  Uh, see you Sunday?
I'm joking.
You're never ever allowed in my church again.
I love you, too.
Okay.
I just kept hoping I just kept hoping The way would become clear He went that way.
I spent all this time Trying to play it nice I found my way here See, I've been having me a real hard time But it feels so nice To know I'm going to be all right So I just kept dreaming Yeah, I just kept dreaming It wasn't very hard I spent all this time Trying to figure out why Nobody on my side See, I've been having me a real good time And it feels so nice To know I'm going to be all right Yeah, if I wanted to I'd be all right
