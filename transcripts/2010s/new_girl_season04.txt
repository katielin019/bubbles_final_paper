{START OF EPISODE 1}
I can't.
I can't do it.
Oh, of course you can and you will.
Okay, Schmidt, we've been to 11 weddings in a row.
That's too many weddings.
I can't even get into the fridge anymore.
Aah!
I'm so hungry.
Why does everybody get to have a party for everything in their life?
Why can't I have a party for really dedicating myself to knitting this summer?
God, I hate that you knit.
I hate everything about it.
Why?
It makes me angry and scared all at the same time.
Just like when I hear the phrase, "academy award winner Anna Paquin".
Jessica, you are going to this wedding.
Well well Sexual intercourse.
Do you remember that?
You got to get back out there, Jess.
The last mouth that you kissed was Nick's mouth.
That was four months ago.
Think about that.
That's horrible.
Hey.
Is Schmidt making fun of me?
- Yes.
- Hi, Nick.
Okay, cool.
Just checking.
Are you wearing tap shoes?
I got 'em at the goodwill.
I thought they were just really shiny dress shoes.
They're cool.
Hey, what do you guys think about this belt?
Like for a wedding gift?
Nick, coach, get in here.
Everybody in here.
Are we a man down?
I feel like there's one more of us.
Something's going on in Jess' room?
!
I'm coming!
Just wait for me.
He's sore from police academy.
I'm sore from police academy!
Okay, we have gone to wedding after wedding this summer, and, with the exception of coach and myself, none of us have truly taken advantage of the sexual opportunities that a wedding provides.
Not true.
Wedding number seven, an unneutered dog ran after me, so I made out with a bridesmaid.
- You did?
- Yes.
She was wearing a hospital bracelet and carrying a dead goldfish in a bag.
She was still a bridesmaid.
She looked like the snowman fromFrozen.
Hey, aim for the middle.
The ride's rough at first, but the body adjusts.
I'm all right!
I just rolled off the couch.
Winston, please!
I can't close my ass!
We are hooking up tonight, all five of us, including the gimp.
This is the last wedding of summer, which means it is our last chance.
- Nobody meets anybody in fall - No.
Or winter.
What, are you gonna gamble on the unknown contents of a bulky sweater?
- Not me.
- Do you realize how important this is?
I do.
Winter is coming.
No one comes home alone.
You know what, yeah.
Yeah, I'm in.
She's in.
We're all in.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
I'm in.
I can't hear what's going on, but I'm in.
All five of us out there together, in the wild, getting some strange, like a sex fist.
- I'm sorry, what?
- Mm, that's not what you mean.
- What's a sex fist, now?
- One, two, three, four, five of us, together, make a fist.
- You're making a mistake right now.
- Schmidt, Nick, coach, Winston, Jess sex fist.
- When you put them all together, - No, that's not right.
tearing our way through the reception.
- Slow down.
- Are you listening to what you're saying?
Isn't that sweet?
It's a metaphor for togetherness.
- It could just be a fist.
- All five of us sex-fisting our way S04E01 The Last Wedding Hi, everybody.
Uh, I'm Ted.
I'm, uh I'm Mark's best friend and his best man.
I-I've known mark since he was in diapers, you know?
Uh, and, by that, I mean junior year of college.
Ah, what about him, Jess?
- What?
The best man?
- Best man.
Get real, you clown.
I've been out of the game too long.
- He's a wedding celebrity.
- Everybody say hi to Nana.
How great does Nana look, everybody?
Give it up for Nana.
Six months sober.
I'm kidding.
Three months.
Jess, come on.
Get in there.
- What?
- You got this.
- Think so?
- Yes, you got the bangs parted.
You're looking good.
- Really?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Stick your boobs out.
Gotta turn the headlights on.
Ew!
Schmidt.
But you got it.
Sex fist.
All right.
Hi.
Hi to you.
I'm coach.
Oh, my God.
You don't remember me?
Yeah Yeah, I remember Ooh Ooh - I'm good.
- It's the end of the wedding season.
We've got some repeats.
Oh, God.
What is she doing here?
I thought she was in Australia.
How do I look?
How-how Jewish?
I mean, like, good Jewish or bad Jewish?
Oh, I won't say it feels like a trap.
Come on.
Come with me.
I haven't told the guys that you broke up with Buster yet, 'cause, um I feel like I might have to tell Schmidt outside a hospital, like, you know, when you give a baby peanut butter for the first time?
Yeah.
You're not doing this tonight.
- What?
- You're not doing this tonight.
- I'm not listening to you.
- You're not doing this tonight.
I'm picturing CeCe naked.
Stop doing this!
CeCe has a boyfriend, and your obsession with her is not good for you, man.
She's been away all summer, and you have been killing it!
Mostly hand stuff.
Who had sex with a bridesmaid on a 45-minute flight to San Jose?
- Me.
- You were boarding group "d".
She was "b".
How's that even possible?
- Gotta think outside of the box, my man.
- Now get your little white butt back out there and finish the summer of sex that you started.
That's what I'm talking about.
CeCe gone.
See that bridesmaid right there?
- The pretty one?
- Sure do.
- The foxy lady?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you're going home with her tonight.
- And I got your back.
- Look at that.
She looks like the girl from the commercial playing tennis with a tampon in.
Let's do it.
Hi.
I'm Jess.
Hi.
I'm Ted.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
So you're from Wisconsin I'm sorry.
Is this thing on?
You're making your throat like a microphone.
Yeah.
That's funny!
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- I loved your speech.
- Oh.
- Hi.
I'm Kat.
- Hi.
- I'm Ted.
- Really nice to meet you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Excuse me.
My girlfriend's getting jealous.
Perfect specimen.
Ted is the only eligible guy here, and we are his two best options for procreation.
Oh.
I'm not trying to intimidate you, I just want you to know who you're dealing with if we're both gonna compete for this man tonight.
What?
Here are the facts: I am technically a genius, I have a photographic memory and I lost my virginity to Malcolm Gladwell.
Okay Have you ever heard of plutoxic syndrome?
That's because I cured it.
You're welcome, vaginas everywhere.
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm sorry, that was Vagina voice, and a It was a huge mistake.
I stay current on sporting events.
I watch 30 minutes of porn every night just to stay up to date on the latest sex trends.
In the coming months, I'm predicting a throwback to missionary.
It all depends on what happens in Syria.
Well, have you ever had sex when you were really, really, really, really, - really, really tired?
- I'm never tired.
I'm the better choice of mate.
From a purely biological standpoint, you're shorter, weaker, and dumber.
No offense.
I love those shoes.
I love your shoes.
But I love your shoes.
Your shoes.
- No, I love your shoes.
- Your shoes.
- Your shoes.
- Your shoes.
Your shoes.
- What?
- I was just moving my mouth.
- So you're competing with her?
- I can take her down, because I have something she doesn't have: You guys.
Now, strategies.
What about you, coach?
You hook up at weddings all the time.
What's your strategy?
It's called being a gorgeous black man with the body of an action figure.
I could give that a try.
You want to know what your ex-boyfriend thinks you should do to get the guy?
No, I don't.
That's super weird.
Yeah, it's too weird, so Somebody else.
Okay, look, babe, just get out on the dance floor, okay?
Guys think that they way you dance is the way you have sex.
Okay.
So just give them a little something, okay?
You just need to, like, roll your body a little bit.
Something a little sexy.
Pop your hip out a little bit.
Hey, man, I'm not gonna lie to you right now.
- I've got a halfie.
- Okay, we got to go!
- Excuse me, everybody!
- I need a minute.
What do you think of this?
Mm hmm Mm-mm.
- I'm good to go now.
- Let's go!
All right.
Ugh!
I just want to get back out there, but I feel like I forgot everything I knew.
Do you guys still like an Oakland face with an L.A. booty?
Would you like to know my strategy, Jess?
Is the art of seduction really where you shine?
Be there.
- That's it?
- Yeah.
Just be there.
No matter where he goes, be there.
He gets a drink, be there.
He talks to his friends, be there.
At the end of the night, be there.
It's called "the Joe Biden".
That's creepy, man.
The basic concept of what he's saying, though, - could actually work.
- Yeah.
I'm gonna biden his ass.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Yup.
That'll do it.
I know.
Oh, hey!
Uh, you know, Kat was just telling me about her hairlessness.
Hmm.
She's like a seal.
Hmm.
That's okay.
You guys talk.
I'm just gonna be here.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Why are you so scared of intimacy?
Who broke your heart and why haven't you forgiven her?
Uh well Yeah, the thi Huh?
You're arrogant, you're sexist You stole my phone charger.
You're conceited.
You're a liar.
Aah!
I rented best man holiday.
You're not in it.
So, you know Tom Uh, Tom, of course, he wanted to sell shoes for a profit.
And I said, "no".
I said, "you You do something better".
You got a pretty good face.
So, you guys want to come home with us, right?
We want to do a four-way.
Me, her, you and him.
Of course.
We'll, uh Nick?
Nick?
!
- Hi.
How are you?
- Hi.
Good.
How are you?
- Are you enjoying the wedding?
- Yeah.
You be yeah.
Mm!
Hey.
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey, Schmidt.
Hey, do you know how they sell ice cream at the drugstore?
I'm not having a four-way with you end of discussion.
Come on, Nick.
We don't have any other choice.
I've found 15 other girls since I've been here.
They're all either married or taken or mad at coach.
I'm not doing a four-way with you It's the last helicopter out of Saigon, my man.
Charlie won.
- No, Schmidt.
- You won't even know it's me, Nick.
Look, at this point, it's all skin and shapes That's-that's what I'm afraid of.
It-it's the fog of war, man.
There's so much stuff going on.
- You're just, you're just here.
- Yeah You don't even know what's happening.
Okay, but I want to know what's happening if it's with sex I don't want some fog of war on top of me, if it looks like you.
That's the point.
The fog of war is something you can't see through.
Like, the whole thing with the Charlie thing and Vietnam, I don't know who I'm fighting!
I'm soft like a lady.
You won't even know.
- But what if I get a surprise?
- "A surprise"?
- What if there's a surprise on me?
- There's not gonna be a surprise on you.
What if I'm fighting the war and boom there's a surprise!
You go north, I go south.
Do you know what I'm saying?
I'll be in steerage and I'm rowing.
And I'm rowing and I'm rowing and the You're up in the crow's nest.
Fre-fresh air up there, man.
And I'm in the trenches, you know?
I'm digging for coal.
I'm breathing in those fumes.
And you're up here.
You're just taking in the sights.
You're spotting dolphins, huh?
You're just the handsome prince covered in salty sea spray I don't want you calling me handsome before a potential four-way!
This Nick, please!
I'm begging you for this.
CeCe is here.
And I can't get her out of my head.
Don't, don't, don't play the CeCe card right now, don't do I'm gonna play the CeCe card, okay?
Look, she's here and I don't want to go home alone.
I need your help, please.
What's up, guys?
Tell you what.
I am so sore I can't have sex with nobody tonight.
Only thing I want in my mouth is Mr. and Mrs. I.B.
Profen.
Minus the mister.
My man Winston, I got a question for you.
Do you think that, that two men can engage in group sex without without compromising their friendship.
Good question, good question.
Um okay.
Uh, let's just say Nick is the salt.
And, Schmidt, you are the pepper.
I'm assuming we're talking about you two.
- Hypothetically, I suppose.
- Whatever.
Yes.
Hypothetically, all right.
Not necessarily.
Actually I'm gonna need some Ooh, boy.
Seems as if I've made a mess.
Got to clean that up.
Yes, look at that.
Salt all in the pepper.
Pepper all in the salt.
Just mixed up like that.
Is there salt shoved in the pepper hole?
How'd it get in there?
How did salt get shoved into this tiny, tiny pepper hole?
Nick?
You're terrible at demonstrations!
Oh, uh You know, I-I'm just gonna, uh Yeah, Ted.
Get crazy.
Leave it all out there on the field.
Okay.
I'll come back with stories.
- Are you bidening?
- What?
No.
How did you know about that?
Because I'm always gonna be one step ahead of you.
Extreme biden!
Kat.
Kat, Kat let me out.
This was a huge mistake.
I'm sorry.
I'm not proud of this.
It smells so bad in here.
Jess?
Hi.
Jess, th-this is the men's room.
This is where it all happens.
Don't wait for me, Ted, 'cause I might be awhile.
See you out on the dance floor.
And at wedding 12, I sat on a men's toilet.
When did one-on-one sex become old-fashioned?
You know, America's got to take a hard look in the mirror at ourself.
We used to make things.
Just be glad you're not single.
Oh.
Actually Buster and I broke up.
- So, anyway - Oh no!
No!
That is so terrible!
- Didn't know you cared this much.
- No, no, no, no - If you're single - Mm-hmm.
that means that I have to do something.
Something awful.
You have no idea what you just did to me.
You have no idea, young lady!
I'll do the four-way with you.
Yes!
Okay, I'm gonna go book the room.
You go to housekeeping, have them give you as many shower caps - as they'll give you - Okay, stop.
They're gonna get one hand and I'm not gonna move it.
I'm just gonna dangle it into the mix while I look at something else on my phone.
And that's the deal.
Aw, man, this is gonna be big for us.
- This is for you, buddy.
- Thanks.
Yeah!
What the hell is that?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, what's-what's that on your hand, man?
Why is it so rough?
It's like hoof.
There's nothing on my hand.
This is a regular old hand I'm out, I'm out.
You're out of what?
Four-way.
Done.
No way.
- Not with that thing.
- You're a buffoon.
That is ridiculous.
I was only doing it for you, Schmidt, so you don't freak out when you find out that CeCe's single.
And now I'm the weirdo with the hoof hand.
What take it back from the hoof hand.
What'd you say before?
About CeCe being single?
How do you know that?
She's single?
I have my, uh - assumptions.
- So CeCe's single now.
You don't know that for sure.
That's interesting.
Why are you so calm?
Interesting.
Don't just say "interesting".
That's interesting.
If you're gonna say "interesting" say why it's interesting.
It is interesting.
Aah!
Nick!
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
It's the men's room!
Mmm Jess, scooch over.
All right.
What are you doing?
Just hiding in the bathroom?
Kind of.
Me, too.
I know I'm supposed to, like, "get back out there," you know?
But Maybe I'm just not built for it.
Man, I hear you.
What do my hands feel like?
- Hooves.
- Aw, son of a Maybe there's a reason I'm not up on a fridge, you know?
Maybe some people are fridge people, and other people are toilet people.
You think you're a toilet person?
You're not a toilet person.
You want to get on the fridge, you'll get on the fridge, Jess.
Just be yourself, and if he's not into Jessica day, then there's something wrong with him.
Be myself.
Like do my Tina Turner impression?
How did your brain jump there?
What's love got to do got to do with it?
All right.
I hear your logic.
- Come on.
- No man wants that, but you can't quit, either.
You're our last hope.
You're the only one out of the group who might not go home alone tonight, Jess.
- Really?
- Yes.
It's all on your shoulders.
So the sex fist has turned into a sex finger.
- Uh, don't yeah.
- Sex finger.
Hey.
Ted.
Um I'm out of moves, so I'm just gonna try being myself.
Here's some stuff about me: I've never cured anything.
I'm a middle school vice principal and I love my job.
Um, I'm just getting out of a relationship with a guy that I still live with, which is kind of complicated.
He's over there.
What's up, Nick?
Hi, I'm Nick!
Sometimes I cry when newscasters wish each other "Happy Birthday" on air.
My first crush was on a Batman cake, but my first sexual feelings were about teenage Simba.
'Cause he was super hot, and I still, actually, find him hot.
Uh, truth time.
Um So that's me.
And if you want to take me home, Ted, we can definitely do some no-bra stuff.
Uh That's me naked.
Well and this is me with a guy who I thought was Larry king.
So it's decision time.
Yeah, Ted, who's it gonna be?
Me or Jess?
Hmm?
Ooh Wow.
Hah.
Ooh This is tough.
I mean, okay, 'cause I mean, over here we've got, you know, the whole you know.
And then, but of course over here we got the bing, and the you know.
Mmm Oh, God, what do I do?
What do I do?
- It's over.
- Moment's passed, Ted.
Okay.
I'll take him out.
So you and Buster broke up.
Whew.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm just waiting for you to do something weird now.
Yeah, I feel that coming on, so, um I'm gonna go.
You know what doesn't whine and cry is the sperm in my freezer.
I am counting down the days until we don't need men to procreate.
If I really put my mind to it Autumn 2018.
Are you ready?
Oh, it's my plan "b".
Yeah.
Beats going home alone.
Just giving her a ride.
Nothing weird.
We do this every time.
So, Katherine, uh Where do you live?
About two inches north of your mouth, Padre.
Bye.
Bye.
It's okay, Jess.
Sex fist is obviously over.
We're all going home alone.
Well, that's where you're wrong, Schmidt.
We're not going home alone.
- That's great.
- All right.
It's like that.
"Regan, Kevin and Rebecca" "request the honor of your presence".
How about the honor of my garbage can?
Hey!
Those fridge people with their stupid houses Oh, look at this one, guys.
Uh, it looks like Jeffrey and Lauren want us to share in their joy.
How about they share in my chocolate pocket?
What does that mean?
In my butt.
- Mm-mm.
- That's gross.
Yeah, I Oh, man how about this one, you guys?
Scott and Derek.
Yeah, real tasteful wedding - for a Thursday!
- Yeah.
Oh, look at that Laurie and Mitchell.
They had a cash bar.
I hope they can't have kids!
That's super dark, bro.
- That was too far.
I hope they can - Yeah!
I hope they can, I hope they can.
CeCe and Shivrang You bastards, take that one down.
You know what?
It's gone.
No - Take that one down!
- Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute.
Who are Gabe and Stephanie, with the profile, these things?
Oh, Gabe's the heavy guy with the perm and the wheelchaiair No, Gabe was the guy on the motorcycle No, no, no, no.
The guy with the perm.
The guy who kept showing his stomach the whole time.
That's the woman who was eight and a half months pregnant.
The groom was dressed as the bride Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, uh This wedding's next week.
- What?
- What?
Not anymore.
Whoa!
That's right!
Come on, now!
Ripping it up!
Oh!

Look at that one.
Rippin' 'em up.
Rip.
Oh, right there.
Yes.
Mmm More to rip.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Hey, look who it is!
It's Schmidt.
And This is Barb.
Barb is leaving.
Oh, Barb.
Like the elephant.
That's Babar, you dum-dum.
Barbara.
A little potassium pick-me-up?
Since I know sleeping wasn't the main activity of the night.
Thin walls.
Just kidding.
They're very thick.
You're just so loud!
- You have a lot of roommates.
- So many of 'em.
That's great.
- Bye, Barb.
- Bye, Barb.
Bye, Schmidt.
That was the third piece of nanny - this week, am I right?
- Sure is.
Little shop talk from someone who's also out there trying to crush butt herself.
Um, where are you meeting all these eligible singles, these, uh, elly-sings?
- Dice.
- Hmm?
It's kind of like Tinder.
Dice and Tinder.
I've been to those bars.
They're downtown, right?
Dice is a dating app.
- Dating app.
What?
- It's not for you.
Schmidty.
Come on.
I've Internet dated before.
You send an e-mail, you get excited, you wait, you get an e-mail back.
- You are just describing e-mailing.
- Come on.
You're gonna get eaten alive on Dice.
- Do you want to see - Come on, now.
Do you want to see This is Dice.
Come here.
It's all about split-second decisions, okay?
You see a picture, you swipe down for yes, - you swipe up for no.
- You're so fast.
Instinct.
That's what it's about.
Which you don't have.
Now, I'm gonna go do a deep-ass mouthwash.
Don't go on Dice, Jess.
I won't.
Okay, now.
New account.
I am Darn tootin' fun.
DTF.
Seeks same.
I'm Dicing.
You know, I'm really enjoying the police academy, but, believe it or not, I am not clicking socially with the other cadets.
- What?
Weird.
- Oh, my God.
No.
That's crazy.
- That is super shocking news.
- I can't wrap my head around that.
- That just doesn't add up.
- Everyone's got a nickname but me.
Yo, Swoops!
What up, Gunner?
Hey, Winston Bishop.
Why don't you just go ask them if you can hang out with them sometime?
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
Just invite myself?
Now, that's just rude.
Winnie the Bish wasn't raised to be rude.
Now, save my seat.
I got to go make a caca.
I can't believe we're gonna live with a cop.
I mean, can we still do illegal things?
Like, I don't know, what if I want to get stoned or something?
I've actually never gotten stoned before.
- You've never been stoned?
- What?
Should I do it before he becomes a cop?
- We could do this.
- Really?
We're adults.
We can smoke a little weed.
- I think we should do it.
- It's been a while.
I pick up stuff really quick.
You can't just pick up pot and be good at it.
Like everything else in life, it takes practice.
Yeah, if pot were a piano, Nick would be a nine year old Chinese girl.
Daddy's here to take care of you.
I'm gonna guide you through it.
I'll be your spiritual guru.
And Mommy's got nothing to do this afternoon, so I'm gonna bake some damn brownies so we can all freak out.
- Let's do it.
- We're getting stoned?
This is like watching a meeting of idiot 12 year olds.
The hell is that?
What is that noise?
Your cellular technology.
I haven't gotten a non text message in two years.
Jess?
Hey, uh So, I Diced and it was great.
Um, but could I get a ride?
You sure you don't want to hop on for a second?
Do you have a dog, or is this all you?
Which would you prefer?
Schmidt, will you at least just talk to me, please?
He looked nice in his picture.
The frame cut off the bottom of his beard, so how was I to know it was braided into a beardy tail?
- Mmm.
- He asked me to the food court near his house.
I thought that was down to earth, and I liked that.
He didn't bring any money, so we had to go back to his apartment.
And also he wanted to show me some of his old baby clothes.
Maybe I'm not ready for Dice.
Will you just help me, please?
I want to get back out there.
I have to I need to get back out there.
And I know I'm gullible.
'Cause people tell me that, and I have no reason not to believe them.
Teach me to Dice.
Is that a yes?
Schmidt?
What's happening?
Ah!
What the hell?
I will teach you Dice.
Welcome and good morning.
- It's weird here in the morning.
- It is very sad.
Now, over the next 1,000 minutes, your notions of dating will be challenged.
- Jess, just listen.
No notes.
- I'm sorry.
You put notebooks and pens on the table, - so I thought - I totally get it.
Look, Jess, you're nervous.
Would you like some water?
- Oh, thank you.
- Of course.
- That's really nice of - Never show weakness.
Write that down.
Now, you're on Dice and this hunk shows up.
Hubba hubba, mama in trubba.
Don't ever do that again.
Okay.
So you find this man.
He looks like a Hemsworth, if you will.
He swipes down, you swipe down, you guys set a date.
I show up.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Jack Steele.
Hi, Jack.
- Wrong.
- Is that our Taboo buzzer?
- Not important.
Why did I buzz?
- Do you think you could just return it to the box when you're done?
The reason I buzzed is because I look nothing like this person.
Look at this.
There's a sun-kissed sweetie.
I am a rugged Semitic prince.
- I thought we were role playing.
- Role playing?
What about this feels like a game to you?
Ooh, I got a Dice match.
Jacob.
He has dreamy eyes.
- Them's joint bank account eyes.
- Okay, if you're saying things like "dreamy eyes" to my face, we have more work to do than the Kings of Leon.
Good band, but it feels like they are stuck in one place musically.
Well, I have a good feeling about this guy.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna ask him out.
Hey.
You're not ready yet.
I'm s I'm sorry about your phone.
I'm sure you have the protection plan.
I do have the Never get the protection plan!
The oceans are very wild.
No man or piece of scientific technology has ever been to the bottom of the ocean.
- Titanic did.
- Uh, Titanic sunk down there, but that's not to the bottom.
No, the man who made Titanic did.
I don't know what Manhoo is, but You guys seem a lot higher than me.
Well, it hits everybody at different times, Hoss.
But it's coming for you.
My people!
Time to rally, everybody.
We are going to a party.
I took Cece's advice and decided to invite myself to hang out with some of the other guys, and I think y'all should roll with.
Make me look cooler.
I'll totally go to a party on your butt.
What?
No.
No.
Now, that is a humorous image.
What?
- But, seriously, you have to go.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Know-know what?
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
Okay.
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
- You're gonna go?
- Hey, we're gonna go.
We're gonna go.
- We're gonna go.
- Right on, right on.
Well, then we'll go.
Yeah.
You guys are way too messed up to be going.
You're not an expert.
I am.
Nobody knows we're stoned.
If we didn't go, then they would know.
You're saying that be if we don't go to the party, they're gonna think that we're high.
Oh, the guy who's never done weed.
That's not the proper term.
It's "smoked weed".
You don't "do weed".
That's a test.
You said it.
Listen to me, first order of business, we eat their food.
- Okay.
- Then you look at the pool.
"Aw, what a great pool.
I wish I wish I could dive for rings".
Because if you were stoned, you wouldn't dive for rings.
Um, I was just thinking of this impression.
Who am I doing?
- Who am I doing?
- Al Pacino?
Maybe.
So, then, you get home, you eat some pizza Trust me.
I just thought of every single possibility of what could happen at that party, and none of them are bad.
Ooh.
Wow.
This is a big party.
I'm talking wall-to-wall cops.
Man.
Oh, I did not think this through.
It just hit me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
And that is why No matter how tricked out it is You never get into a van.
- "van".
- Okay, moving on.
Classic warning signs.
Now, last night, the crazy man said he needed to meet you near his house.
What he was really saying was, "I expect tonight to end in sex".
Or maybe he doesn't like to be far from his pets.
Never date a man with pets.
The only acceptable pet for a man to have is a saltwater fish.
Okay, what now?
Okay, first test.
Now, I'm gonna say something, and you tell me what's really being said.
Oh, you know, I'm just staying in a hotel right now.
"I like to travel".
Homeless.
Pervert.
Oh, my God, my mom is just the most amazing woman.
Oh.
"I love my mother".
Virgin.
And somehow also a pervert.
I kind of prefer public transportation.
Oh.
Earth-conscious.
Multiple DUIs.
Pervert.
Okay, time for the next phase.
- Next phase?
- Jess?
- Hi.
I'm Malcolm.
From Dice?
- Oh Oh.
- Hi.
- Hey.
She'll be with you in just a minute.
Okay.
You set me up on a date?
I'm wearing my lounge-around underwear.
I set you up on ten dates.
- What?
- Ten years of experience in one day.
Expert by midnight.
The Dice Diez.
"Diez" is Spanish for ten.
Are you insane, Schmidt?
I'm not ready.
That's like taking a musical from rehearsals straight to Broadway.
You got to workshop it first If you are for one second suggesting that I don't know how to open a musical How dare you?
I'm trying to help you out here.
Now, of course you're not ready, Jess.
That's why I set up ten dates.
Now, you can do this.
Come on.
All right.
So - So.
- Date talk.
Okay.
What do you do?
Um, well, I don't have a job, currently, right now, in the traditional "nine to five" sense, but, uh, I got a lot cooking.
I "grow" "raisins".
I'm sorry, Malcolm, um, I'm gonna have to Get out of there.
let you finish that story.
Oh, okay.
I grow two types of raisins.
There's the Leopold raisin, - which is from Austria.
- Mm-hmm.
And then there's the Zwiebel raisin, which is also from Austria.
But I think the main thing that got me through my time in prison was the realization that a "raisin" can be anything.
We got to go!
Ma called.
The bees are back.
Ma called.
The bees are back.
Oh, okay.
Um Should I just Should I wait for you?
You know that was a bad date, right?
I know, but I just felt so trapped.
Just do what I did, make up an excuse and then leave.
Just, just say as little as you need to, okay?
Make it your own.
You ready?
Yeah.
- You can do this.
- Okay.
You have so much hair.
What?
Where did all that hair come from?
You're like a lioness.
So, did you know you could put a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it without plucking it or preparing it at all?
Keep it simple.
Uh, let's keep it simple.
You're a nice guy, and that's a neat outfit.
Are you a chef?
Are you a beatnik?
Are Do you work on - on a submarine?
- Shh.
No!
No!
Oh.
Stand down, - sir!
- We found your son.
He's alive.
They found my son; he's alive.
I'm sorry.
It was nice meeting you.
All right, now, remember, y'all are my dogs, okay?
So just stay by my side and make me look cool.
If I tell a joke, dogs got to bark.
I want to see those tails wagging out there, okay?
Oh, okay, look.
Look, there's Dugan.
There's Dugan.
That's the guy I was telling you about.
Come on.
Over there is better.
All right.
- What?
- Whatever the hell that means.
Is there a cop in the house?
I feel really calm.
Really relaxed.
- Oh, look, a hummingbird.
- What the hell are you talking about?
There's no such thing as a hummingbird.
Birds don't hum.
They sing.
They basically invented singing.
You're so high right now, man.
You're so high, I couldn't possibly even bring you back.
Actually, dude, I feel really good.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, when you walk, you look like an insane person.
Okay?
And your voice sounds so stoned and crazy.
Say something.
Hello, Nick.
That took you, like, 20 minutes.
"Hello, Nick".
And now I'm a model and a bartender.
But I I'm not sure what's next.
I feel a little lost.
I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing with my life.
I'm so sorry.
What was your question again?
I didn't ask you anything.
You just walked up and started talking.
So, man, I'm in the locker room, and I see a spider, and I'm like, "I hope this is Charlotte's Web and you're nice".
You haven't seen Charlotte's Web?
Charlotte's Web, the, uh, cartoon.
The tale about the spider who was super chill and super cool.
Then, well, series of events, she ended up dying.
So that was sad.
That was sad, but spoiler alert, if you haven't seen it.
I'm sure you You haven't seen it.
Where are my dogs?
I took the liberty of writing down some exit lines, because obviously, you can't come up with any on your own.
Here, take a look at those.
I've got hockey practice?
- Sure.
- My boss is trying to contact me about a project that could save the company.
- Mm-hmm.
- Schmidt, these are such obvious rejections.
I don't want to hurt their feelings.
Hurt their feel Do you just walk around all day thinking about other people's feelings?
Yeah.
Don't you?
No.
How do you get anything done?
- It's hard.
- Okay, Jess, how can I put this?
You're the prize here.
Okay?
You are the last piece of pie, and all of these guys are the fat kids in the cafeteria, and I can say that because I used to be fat as a truck.
You really think I'm the last piece of pie?
Damn right you're the last piece of pie.
You're the best girl on Dice, Jess.
And who cares what these guys are feeling?
You know, what do you feel?
Jess, what do you want?
I'm the pie.
You're the pie.
I'm the pie.
- Say it again.
- I'm the pie.
- Say it again.
- I'm the pie.
There you go.
Who are you?
Never really thought about that.
Mmm.
I'm not gay, but I would go crazy on Michael Strahan.
A prominent U.S. senator is trying to contact me.
You know, I just think Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.
An important document has gone missing.
I need to find it.
I've been getting into a lot of fist fights lately.
Like, a lot.
More than usual.
But, you know, I'm kind of enjoying them now.
I have an acquaintance who's in jeopardy.
Jess?
Nope, not Jess.
Velcro shoes, pervert.
I didn't even see those.
I would love for you to share share what you think I should do with my life.
Am I boring you now?
Officer, can I read you your rights?
You have the right to remain hugged.
Oh, no, Coach!
And you have the right to remain sweet.
Run!
Diversion!
Run!
Run!
Now!
Now!
Uh, du?
Whoa.
Hold on!
What's with your friends, Winston Bishop?
They kicked over the grill, and then they ran that way.
Yeah I know.
Wow.
Last date.
It's a big moment.
Oh, my God, is that who I think it is?
I give you Dreamy Eyes Jacob.
Happy Dice birthday, Jess.
You're ready for this.
Now, go get him.
Thank you, sir.
Wait a minute.
Are you from Portland?
The Jolly Cow Creamery.
Yeah, I used to work there summers in high school.
- No way.
I'm from Portland, too.
- Are you serious?
Yes.
I used to go there all the time in high school.
- Oh, my God.
- That's so funny.
Yeah, I hope you like this place.
I live, like, right across the street, so Oh.
I get it.
You asked me here because -you want me to go home with you.
- Wait.
What?
No.
Um, you know what?
I got to go.
I have hockey practice.
I'm center wing, so they really need me.
I Wow.
Okay, I just live across the street.
I'm not some weirdo trying to lure you back to my apartment.
I thought we were kind of hitting it off.
Guess you just make a snap decision, and then that's it, so All right, well, have a good practice.
And by the way, there's no center wing in hockey.
The Dice Diez!
You did it!
This thing is on!
How do you open it?
Oh, wow.
This isn't even champagne.
Look, it's a super fancy salad dressing.
That is delightful.
We're celebrating Me and you.
Jess, you can have whatever you want on the menu.
They got pizza, gelato, Tikka Masala.
A raw bar.
This place is doing too much.
They can't be doing all this right.
What's wrong with you?
I just don't understand how what we did today is gonna help me find love.
Love?
Well, why would you want to fall in love?
Why else would I go on dates?
The point of dating is just to keep on dating, and then never stop.
It's like burning fossil fuels or seeing a therapist.
No.
Schmidt, the whole point of going on dates is to fall in love and have a relationship.
Like, don't you ever worry that you're missing out?
I mean, you're plowing through all these girls, and some of 'em might be great, but you'll never know.
Do you want to go through life that way?
Yeah.
I don't.
Oh, hey, yeah.
I'll take the, um the rock shrimp meatballs.
What is this place?
I think my life is going nowhere.
Oh.
Mmm.
No, Cece.
It's wonderful here.
Do you like to learn?
I do.
I see you going back to school.
- I see it, too.
- Yes, yes.
- I don't see it.
- Yes.
She's a bartender.
Why would she get paid for it?
She's not very good at it.
- On the floor!
- Shut up!
Get the dog!
- Get down on the ground!
- Yeah, and stay down!
I'm a student!
- Both of you, butts up.
- I'm trying.
I'm trying.
See, I see you guys were high, so I got these guys to come and mess with you.
Let's go, man.
Let's never do drugs again.
That was a lot of fun Toilet.
"Toilet".
Is that is that my nickname?
Yeah, 'cause living with these guys, - you got to put up with a lot of crap.
- Lot of crap.
Let's get a beer.
Thank you very much.
Flush, flush, what's the rush?
Toilet's coming!
You guys want to go back in?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming back.
- Sure.
Look, I'm I'm really sorry.
Um, I was I don't know where to begin.
Uh, my roommate taught me all of these phony excuses to get out of dates.
Well, anyway, that is not me.
- Okay.
- So will you give me another chance to get to know you?
Yeah.
Let's go back in and get a drink.
Yes.
Great.
Hey, uh, you know, we can just make that last date disappear.
Like this coin.
Oh.
You're a magician.
No.
Ugh.
No.
I'm a comedy magician.
Even better.
And, like a lot of people in comedy, I have a little problem with, uh Nose candy.
Uh-oh.
Can't have this.
It's my last one.
No I'm kidding.
Take it.
- I don't want it.
- Please take it.
No, you take it.
Okay.
Let's go in.
Schmidt?
I totally didn't think I'd ever hear from you again.
Well, you know, I just figured, why not see if there's something here?
You know, let's hang out, get to know each other.
There's a coffee place down the street.
Maybe we could go Grab a cup of joe.
I don't think you understand Dice.
Okay.
Jessica!
I'm late to officiate a giant's wedding, and these are stuck.
Now the rings are free, but the groom is imprisoned forever.
- I know how he feels.
- You know what they say.
You got to crack a few eggs to, uh make an Amish.
It's an egg.
It's an Amish person.
My uncle is on fire.
So, you've seen a rabbit pulled out of a hat, but have you ever seen a hat pulled out of a rabbit?
No, no!
Oh, my Okay, this date is over.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- Hey, Nick?
- Shh, I'm reading.
- Can you just give me a second?
- What do you want this time?
!
So, I'm I'm pitching on the sponge account today.
It's kind of a it's kind of a big deal.
I'm just wondering why my idea notebook is covered in crimson stains.
Oh, that's a fair question.
It's either Sloppy Joes, or it's blood.
You unbelievable pig person!
You giant, fat pig person!
You sloth.
You should be living in a tree in Costa Rica, you know that?
Hi, guys.
Um, have either of you seen the French press?
The French press is in cupboard 64B.
Did you not consult your item map?
No, I looked there.
The Tagine's in 64B.
What is the Tagine doing in 64 frickin' B?
!
I used the French press.
Everybody chill out.
So it's in here somewhere.
Nick, you know you're not allowed to use the French press.
I use it to get the pulp out of my juice.
So just give me one second, I'll find it.
Hold on.
Oh, yeah.
I wasn't looking for it, but I found my pulp bowl.
That is a crystal candy bowl filled with orange goop.
I don't need to sit here and take this!
I'm going to my study.
You are gonna get back here and clean your room, mister!
- Guys, I still need the French press.
- Winston, I need my study corner!
No, not after last time.
Hey, Winnie!
You know there's an Albany in California?
Well, hello, Winston Bishop.
I towel-burned my unders.
Well, I just prairie-dogged thanks to you guys.
Stop fighting!
Now the bathroom stinks for no reason.
You happy, Schmidt?
You just scared Coach's poop!
No, I'm not happy.
I'm poor, and I'm living in a filthy thimble.
I've gone from riches to rags.
It's reverse Annie.
Oh, spoiler alert.
Now you just ruined Annie.
Guys, chill out!
Schmidt, your people have been selling sponges since the days of Abraham.
You got this.
Nick, the pulp bowl is real gross.
Tighten up.
Most importantly, my dad is coming with his new girlfriend, and I need the French press.
- Oh, 64B.
The Tagine is in 64B.
- 64B is occupied!
Uh, he said the Tagine is in 64B.
It stinks in there!
What did you do?
!
You kill an animal?
!
How long before you unleash holy hell on your dad's new girlfriend?
I want to make sure I got a good seat and plenty of snacks.
Okay, Cecilia, look, I know I've been a little bit hard on my dad's girlfriends in the past I know you stole my dad's credit card, Margot.
Hit the damn road.
I don't have a car.
Find one.
I was the one who had to pick up the pieces when his heart got broken.
Besides, to hear my dad talk, it sounds like he has really found someone who is good for him.
Ha!
And you believe that?
Your dad has terrible taste in women.
That's why I love him so much.
Remember the one who pretended to be a paraplegic?
- Get up!
- I can't!
Oh, whatever.
That's the last one I met, and I'm lucky he's letting me meet this one.
So, what?
You're just gonna be nice to her?
No fireworks?
No show?
I'm gonna be nice to her no matter who she is.
Then what the hell am I doing here?
Oh.
- Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.
Gee, I'm sorry we're late, you know, but we saw Seal at the airport.
We talked to him for 20 minutes, got his autograph.
- Wasn't him.
- No.
- Anyway, this is Ashley.
- Hi.
I think, um, we went to high school together.
- You went to high school together!
- We went to high school together!
Julie Berkman's older sister Ashley?
That's me.
Is this fun or what?
Oh, my God!
Your dad is dating Trashley Berkman?
- Didn't she ?
- Yes.
She sexually intercoursed my high school boyfriend George Jiang underneath the bleachers.
- While you were sitting - Yes!
While I was sitting on those bleachers.
Have you ever seen sex from above, Cece?
It's horrible.
That's why God thinks it's a sin.
Also, Trashley gave him giardia in his belly ring.
Giardia is a river disease.
She had river mouth.
Wasn't George Jiang, like, six-11?
Yeah.
They called him George Jiang the Giardia Giant, and I never got to hold him in my arms.
What are you gonna do?
!
Uh Uh nothing.
I'm gonna be sweet and kind and supportive.
Look, peop-peop people change.
People change.
It's been 15 years.
- She had sex with our DARE officer!
- No way.
There were rumors flying around about every damn one.
- You remember the rumor about me?
What?
- Oh, that you shaved your chin?
Was that was the rumor about me?
- That was the rumor.
- No.
It was definitely sexier than that.
Thank you guys for coming.
It's really helpful that you're here.
I'm trying to get my boss to give me the new account.
I just have to figure out how to sell sponges to men.
What do I have?
I have a blood-stained idea notebook filled with terrible ideas.
- I don't know what to do, you guys.
- Damn it!
"Spongey make wipey".
I like that.
Okay, please.
I don't have a lot of time.
This is what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna say the word "sponge", and you guys are gonna say the first word that pops into your head, okay?
Ready, one, two, three.
Sponge.
- Sponge!
- Yellow.
- Sponge.
- That was mine.
Okay, let's just try this.
We're gonna try this one more time.
Okay?
Just clear your head, okay?
So I'm gonna say the word, and you're gonna say the first word that pops in your head.
Okay, it might be "sponge".
Don't say "sponge".
- Sponge!
- Sponge.
Damn it!
Focus!
I'm sorry.
Okay, let's just try it again.
Give me a shot.
Give me a shot.
Give me a shot.
I'm gonna say "sponge" one more time, first word that pops into your head.
Ready?
One, two, three, sponge.
Sponge.
Aah!
- Winston!
- Sorry.
So much pressure, man.
Okay, you know what?
Let's move on to Coach.
Coach, here we go.
You're the man of the group.
You should be good at this.
We're selling sponges to men.
Ready, one, two, three, sponge.
- Sponge.
- Why would you say that?
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, come on, come on.
Sponge.
- Cake.
- What?
- Cake.
No!
- Sponge cake.
We all know that men are idiots.
How long have you been in my office?
But what we don't know is how much they love to clean.
You're wasting my time, Schmidt.
Go.
Come on, Gina, you have to give me this account.
They want to market sponges to men.
I'm the only man in the office.
Oh, speaking of.
Sherri, you got the sponge account!
Touchdown!
Yeah.
Just hear me out here.
The reason why men don't talk about how much they love to clean is because they're afraid to admit it.
Give me a chance here.
Be the one to put Schmidt on the map.
Let's blast America right in the face with a little bit of Schmidt.
Oh!
God in heaven!
Fine!
- Put together a focus group, okay?
- I will do that.
This is exciting.
- All right.
Maybe next week we'll start it?
- No.
Today, 3:00.
Today today at 3:00?
Today at 3:00?
I love that idea.
Mm-hmm, you just you just earned a special thank you in my autobiography.
Working title: Punting the Sweet Fantastic.
I feel like you kind of have to do something to write a book about yourself.
Sports!
Oh, it's just so great to see you guys again.
Will you please remind me?
Were you there my first senior year or my second?
I was not good at high school.
Oh, the early 2000s.
God, I did so much E. Just doing E, watching that show Ed.
I would love to know how you two lovers met.
- Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah, sure.
- Okay, so I was listening - to him sing with his band, The Co-Pays.
- Yeah, well - I didn't know you were in a band, Dad.
- Yeah, just just me and a few other pharmacists.
You know, we do alt rock covers.
Oh, man, when he started singing "She's So High" She's so high Stop.
Because I'm gonna fall in love again.
- Okay, go, I want to.
- She's so high Oh.
Oh, man.
That was it.
I was done.
Ashley, have you kept in touch with our DARE officer?
- Oh!
Cece.
- Oh.
Okay, I I get it.
You guys heard about that rumor that I had sex with the DARE officer?
- No!
Only a crazy person - That rumor was true.
- Crazy fun person.
- Oh, yeah, that guy.
- Wow, I did not just say no.
I said yes.
- Oh, yeah.
- I just said, "Yes, yes, yes".
- Oh, she said yes a lot.
She's had sex with hundreds of guys.
Yeah.
You know, we spent some time trying - to total them all up.
- It was fun.
- Killed a whole Saturday.
Yeah.
- We couldn't even get through the list.
We got to the "Ls".
But that was in the past.
And then I was diagnosed with a sex addiction.
- Oh, great.
- Thankfully, I attended rehab.
Which did not take the first time.
Or the second.
But third time's the charm.
For a lot of people.
Not for me.
For me, it took four.
Four times.
Well, Bobby, we should get ready to go to the beach.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Thank you so much for this delicious brunch, Jess.
It was wonderful.
I ate so much, I'm gonna have to bang nine guys just to work it off.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm kidding.
I did do that once, but I'm not gonna do it this time.
It's all in the past for me.
Isn't she great?
I just love her.
She makes me laugh so much.
What?
What what, are you humming?
Mm Dad, just so we have this conversation - No, no, Jess.
- She seems like the type of girl who might hurt you.
- Jessica - I've seen you get hurt by a lot less.
Please, don't don't go there.
No matter what you say, you're not gonna change my mind.
I'm in love with her, and I'm gonna marry her.
Gonna get a new mom, Jess.
She's so high Hey, are you okay?
Because I am not sure if you heard that, but there is going to be a wedding.
Oh there will be no wedding.
And it begins.
Why are we meeting in a parking garage?
Because what we are doing is unsavory - and we're hiding from God.
- And you also you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so Yeah, you definitely did.
- Yes, there'll be pizza.
- Just do one thing for me first.
Here, memorize these.
That's yours.
That's yours.
"I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand".
Look, I had to scramble, you guys.
I told my bosses how much men love to clean.
- What are talking about?
- Only you.
- Yeah, only - Yeah.
I know!
Why do you think I'm rigging this focus group?
"Sponges make me feel more exhilarated than any home run or touchdown ever could".
This is ridiculous, man.
I'm out!
I can buy my own pizza.
Can somebody please loan me $15?
Maybe like 20, 25, depending on toppings, 'cause I'd love to get a bunch of ham.
- Ham.
What about the tip, dude?
- What about tip?
I don't give tips.
It's for delivery.
You don't tip delivery people, ever.
- You definitely tip delivery people, but - Guys.
Guys.
I get sponges, this solves all our problems.
Okay?
I make more money, Nick gets his room back, I get my life back on track.
Punting the Sweet Fantastic.
For the last time, Schmidt, that doesn't mean anything!
Fine.
But I'm gonna need one hour in a quiet room to get into character.
- No.
- Right on.
After long and thoughtful and careful consideration, Winston is in.
- Okay.
- Assuming pizza is still on the table.
Say "pizza" one more time, Winston.
- No, just don't.
- Just don't.
No, we just never talked about - when we're gonna - Don't.
Just don't bring it up.
He's getting really mad.
- Like, delivery of Say "pizza".
- Say "pizza" one more time.
- Don't say it again.
- Say "pizza" again.
- Pizza.
- Say "pizza" one more time, - I'm gonna k kill you!
- I just thought maybe we'd talk about toppings, perhaps, or something.
Not a mirror.
Not a mirror, you idiot.
Not a mirror.
Sponges make me feel exhilarated more than any Did you just say "sponges make me feel exhilarated"?
No, no.
I I..
What do you think of sponges?
- They're stupid.
- That's how I feel.
- I mean, who cares?
- Ex That's exactly how I feel.
What do you think of this whole place?
- I'd rather not be here.
- "Be here" is what I was about to say.
- I'm Nick.
- I'm Brittany.
- Oh, my God, we have so much in common.
- Okay.
My dad can't marry her.
He gets hurt in relationships with normal women.
Yeah.
He can't handle a recovering sex addict.
- No.
- What if she relapses?
It would crush him.
It would crush his heart.
I can't let this happen.
I have to protect him.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I could write him a letter about my feelings.
We Yeah, but her phone is in her purse, and we could check her phone for dirt on her.
But he hates letters.
He always gets so frustrated opening the envelope.
You know you want to check her phone.
You know you want to.
Cece, we're adults; we're gonna handle this like adults.
- We're not snooping.
- You're right, you're right.
That is that's a huge violation of privacy; you can't do that.
Put that What does it say?
- It's bad.
Mm.
- Give that to me.
Dad, she's cheating on you!
- What?
- Yeah, just ask Jim.
At 10:40, Jim heard she was in town.
At 11:52, Jim had his hands down his pants.
And at 11:53 Cumin?
What, is he cooking cumin?
Oh, my God.
My dad is the best guy in the world, and you better hit the damn road, unless you want to say hello to my old friends Crabtree and Evelyn.
That's my work phone.
I'm a sex therapist.
Jim is my client.
Your your client?
- Client!
- Client.
- Client.
- Client.
- Am I supposed to say "client" now?
- I'm gonna go.
This was clearly a mistake.
No.
And for the record, George Jiang gave me giardia.
I saved you from a hideous river disease.
Thank you.
Damn it.
She won't answer any of my calls.
I left ten voice mails.
Two of them, I'm screaming.
Three, I'm crying.
One is a long silent one.
Nothing!
And it's all your fault both of you guys.
But mostly you.
Look, Dad, I'm so sorry.
- Is there anything I can do - There's nothing more that you can do.
I I knew this was a mistake bringing her here.
Wait, Dad.
So, uh, why don't you tell me what you think about that sponge there, Coach.
I mean Ernie.
I don't know why I would call you Coach.
- Okay.
- Um Well, I love sponges because they connect my heart to my hand.
- Wow, thank you so much for that.
- I wish my buddies could see me now.
- What?
- They'd be all like, "Hey, man, let me get a hit of that squishy whip".
Right on.
Way to, uh, add your own take.
Uh, to to your to your own take.
You know, I I have something I'd like to add.
- Please.
- Um, I like cleaning.
- You like cleaning.
- It is the only thing I can control in a world filled with chaos.
- Thank you.
- May I add, I am Thor, and this is my hammer, Mjolnir.
M Melnir.
Mjolnir.
Okay, wonderful detail.
Thank you so much for that.
Uh, how about you down there, Mayor of the Corner?
- Nick.
- What?
How does cleaning make you feel?
Uh, like I I'm cleaning.
Move on to somebody else, please.
Read the cards that I gave you.
Remember the cards?
- Not now.
- Read your cards!
You want to know what I think about your sponges?
!
Well, this is clearly rigged.
My office.
Now, Schmidt.
Schmidt Schmidt, I'm sorry.
Dad.
Thanks for waiting.
I wasn't waiting.
I just can't get this damn thing started.
You're just pressing buttons.
This was supposed to be a big weekend for me and Ashley.
I had everything planned.
I I even wrote new lyrics to our our song.
Ashley, marry me Y you didn't have to do that, you know.
I can take care of myself.
Can you?
Dad, if I hadn't protected you after you and Mom's divorce, you would've ended up with Nancy Zimmerman.
- Oh, Nancy Zimmerman.
- She was bad news, Dad.
Ooh, v very bad.
You don't know the half of it.
That woman made me try cocaine in 2005.
- What, Dad?
!
Booger sugar?
- Yes.
Nicaraguan yazz.
- Are you kidding me?
- It was a very expensive evening.
I wound up buying his and her Jet Skis.
The point is I'm still standing, and I can take care of myself.
Yes, I might get hurt, but that'll be my problem.
You don't need to do it anymore, Jess.
I should be taking care of you.
Ashley is different from any woman I've ever dated.
She she makes every day better.
I I want to spend the rest of my life with her.
Aw, Dad, that's so sweet.
Hey!
Hey, Th Ashley!
What did she do?
She went out and found a guy?
She's gonna relapse.
Um Oh, we have to turn her off.
Ashley - Let's turn on NPR and blare it.
- Oh Ashley, wait.
Wait a minute.
Please.
Please don't do this.
Please.
Ashley, if you're gonna relapse, relapse with my dad.
I'm not relapsing.
This is Roy.
He's my L.A. sponsor.
This is Roy?
Oh!
You know, I I always wanted to meet you.
Hi.
Jess, he's not a strange man.
He's a sex addict.
Former sex addict.
Uh, current chocoholic.
I'd be in trouble if you were black.
Thank you?
Ashley, look, I screwed up.
I have to let my dad make mistakes.
- Oh, I'm a mistake?
- No, you are not a mistake.
That came out wrong.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I never meant to come between you and your daughter.
I love you so damn much.
You're my big, round, bald, fuzzy Weeble-Wobble.
But I just I just need a little space.
It's not over, Dad.
Get the ring.
I'm sorry, Schmidt.
What can I say?
You're just not really built to play with the big girls.
- Don't fire him!
- Oh, God.
- What the Why?
- Give him the account.
He's a hard worker, and he's a neat freak.
How do I know that?
'Cause I share a room with him.
- You two share a room?
- And you should see his side.
It is so clean.
It looks like the inside of a Japanese subway.
Speaking of sharing a bedroom, Brittany's coming over tonight.
Uh, so I'm gonna need ten to I don't need 15 minutes.
That's excessive.
Give me five to ten.
That feels braggy.
Give me three to five, but no less than three 'cause that's rude to girls.
Do you really think that she's gonna have sex with you - in that pulp-covered filth bunker?
- I'll throw a tarp down.
- Oh, God.
- What if she's turned off by the mess?
What if she's turned off by What if she's turned off by the mess?
Hey, Gina, why don't you hear me out here for a second.
- That's all right.
- If Nick cleans his room before Brittany comes over, he might get laid.
I don't know.
It seems like a lot of work.
Not with the right tool.
We open up on a modern man with a nose that only America could love.
This might seem obvious, but what side does the dirty stuff go on?
He doesn't know a lot, but he's about to discover the ultimate wingman.
I bet this side is really good for tough areas.
The Man Sponge.
Because the dirtiest thing in your room Probably be her.
- Yay.
We're doing a pitch.
- Yeah.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I like it.
All right, you get the sponge account, Schmidt.
Sponges.
We got sponges.

- Oh.
You Here, come on, come on.
Let's get you to a hospital.
Yeah.
Yes.
- Oh, my God!
Is she okay?
- I don't know.
I mean, are you okay?
You need to do it now, Dad, before we get flattened by a parade.
Come on.
Ashley will you marry me?
And be the stepmom to a very crazy but but very lovable woman?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Jess, you're my little girl now.
Oh, Jess.
You go to your room.
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
But you should go to a a hospital.
Here's to attending a wedding with everyone from high school and my dad's side of the family.
It's gonna be great.
It's like going to prom - with all my dad's friends.
- Hear, hear!
Oh.
Oh.
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't worry, don't worry.
I got it.
I got it.
I'll just clean it.
Dude, there's a sponge - in your hand.
- No, let him go.
He's my inspiration.
You know, living with him in that slovenly hellhole has been a secret blessing.
It's made me stronger.
Without ash to rise from, the phoenix would just be a bird getting up.
- I am a phoenix, and I will rise.
- He usually says that speech before sex.
By 2015, I will have my own room.
And by 2016 - What is he looking at?
- I don't know.
I will be a millionaire.
Spongey make wipey.
The Man Sponge.
Because the dirtiest thing in your room Should be me.
Sponge.
Sponge.

{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
2 Ooh-hoo-hoo, yeah.
I like those boobies.
Sweet little '70s boobies.
Bra burning, feminist boobies.
Bouncin' around like they ain't go no sense.
You like 1970s cans?
See, not me-- I'm a 1950s guy.
Post-Korean War, pre-Vietnam War.
- My nana has those.
- Okay.
Check it out.
Holy cow.
- Almost too big.
- Too big.
- Way too big.
- Those are intimidating, right?
Too small.
Gotta be able to palm a basketball, if you want to slam or jam or dunk it.
See, they're too straight for me, you know?
I like 'em going in two different directions.
Oh, yeah, like his eyes.
Ooh.
Now, see, my boobs got to go "Ooh"!
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.
You guys are ruling women out based on their breast size?
It's the least important part of a woman's body.
Unless you're a baby.
Are you guys babies?
- We're not babies.
- I'd like to think that that you guys see value in women's bodies other than - just the way they look.
- Come on, Jess, you're really gonna tell me - that you don't care what a guy looks like?
- Well I'll notice an attractive man.
I can go to the butcher and pick out a nice rump.
But I'm not gonna rule out a guy based on how he looks-- that's shallow.
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, right.
- That explains so much.
- What?
Okay, if you saw me in the bar and I was a stranger, would you rule me out based on my breast size?
Absolutely not.
Your breasts are perfect.
Now, if I saw your wonky knee?
-That's a whole 'nother ballgame.
- What w - Wonky knee?
- You have a wonky knee?
You think I have a wonky knee?
The left knee's perfect.
Uh, but the right one's got some stuff.
- Why?
- Well, stuff.
Oh, why do you think I always let you take your own pants off before sex?
Because you're the laziest person I've ever met.
Wonky knee, huh?
I have a Sesame Street problem.
This is what's wrong with men in this country.
You all sit around all day and you read your porno magazines What's a porno magazine?
And you think that's what women are supposed to look like.
Well, I have news for you, okay?
Real women are wonky.
Perhaps.
But, like climate change, we pretend they don't exist.
Right?
Do you guys all just think you're so perfect?
- Yeah.
- Pretty close.
Ah, please.
I mean, you're an eight, you're an eight and a half.
Everybody knows I'm a sweet, sweet six.
Winston, for the last time, stop rating us.
Jess, I know I'm not perfect, but if you're asking me if I judge, you know, women based off their breasts, then the answer is yes.
Everybody knows that boobs are a direct indicator of personality.
All right What are you guys doing?
Yeah, how you walking on this thing?
That knee is not architecturally sound.
I don't trust it.
Man, if you had a jacket on with a bunch of yellow feathers, I'd be done!
I've had enough.
This is insulting.
I'm so sorry, I know I don't know you, I know this is your booth, but, uh, my friends are really pissing me off.
I'm just gonna sit here for like five minutes.
Or maybe ten.
Probably an hour.
They're super annoying to me.
Okay.
Why are you mad at your friends?
They're so shallow.
They're like They say that they have a boob shape preference, but when the chips are down, they'll take anything.
So would it be bad if I told you that I think you're hot?
Shut your gross, beautiful face.
No, I'd love it.
Thank you.
- Hi.
I'm Matt.
- I'm Jessica.
Pleasure to meet you.
Hey, you, uh, you want to maybe go out some time?
Yes, I do.
Yes.
Should I put my number in your phone or Yeah, that's that works.
- Great.
- Works for me.
But, you know, while-while we're on the subject of stupid physical stuff, you know, I should probably tell you before we go out, I have a micropenis.
Cool.
What?
It's a medical condition-- it means I'm unusually small.
Technically, "Micro".
Well lucky for you my eyes are bigger than my stomach.
I don't know what that means.
But I'm free tomorrow night.
It's an actual medical condition.
Here's a web page all about it.
I don't know what I'm looking at.
Where is the It's right there.
I think.
Yeah.
No.
It's like a single tent in a a vast, dark forest.
It's like the letter "I" floating around in a bowl of alphabet soup.
Oh, that's awesome-- an anteater's being born.
Winston, it's a micropenis, bro.
That's a grown man?
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my God.
Come on, guys, stop it.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Are you honestly going on a date with somebody who has one of these?
Yes, I am, 'cause I don't care what a guy's body looks like.
You know what revs me up?
A fertile mind and a gentle spirit.
A nice, smart guy How do you know he's nice?
You barely know him.
Man made it through middle school with that ghoulish raisin.
He's a hero.
I bet you're not gonna last a week with this guy.
I bet I last at least a month.
- You want to put money down?
- Oh, absolutely.
- 500 bucks.
- All right.
Great.
You said yeah?
If I date him a month, then you will donate 500 bucks to the National Organization for Women's Love Your Body campaign.
And if you win, I will get you a subscription to the porn site of your choosing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Nubile Nubian Butts.
- We know, dude.
- Shut up, Winston.
We're gonna go with Ass Chat.
Ass Chat?
Come on, what is that-- two butts talking to each other?
It's not butts talking to each other.
No, it's all a lot categories.
I'd like you to realize, someday, that a nice, sweet guy who just happens to have a little squeaker is just as attractive as a guy with a blue-ribbon hog that's ready for market.
Honey, if you have a blue-ribbon hog, you don't take it to the market, you breed that pig.
- 'Cause what's he gonna do at the market?
- Shut up, Nick.
- You know what I mean?
- Winston, honestly I'm sure the National Organization of Women will look forward to your donation.
Hey, boys, want you push heavy up?
Get 'em, Heavy.
We got us a bet.
So I'm like "Screw it grandma I'm-a become a street artist, yo".
I mean, most people see a wall and they just see a wall.
I look at a wall and I see, like a goat in a backpack.
- Right.
- Like, a ninja handing out cheeseburgers.
A chill alien, you know?
Well, who doesn't see a chill alien?
- That's my question.
- Lot of people.
Lot of people.
It's sad.
You have any tattoos?
- No.
- I got seven.
- Oh, good.
- Check it.
Star.
I have a question-- do you know of a web site called "Ass Chat" and do you know if it's socially conscious?
Just based off the name, I'd say, probably, yeah.
Okay, so you guys are kind of bringing the bar vibe down, and I need tips, so pretend that you're having fun or pay for me to go to college.
You know, if I could give that poor man some of my penis, I would.
But, obviously, you don't pull a bumper off a Ferrari.
It did go fast, I'll give it that.
You know, when I look at that picture, I think to myself, "Is there a God?
And if-if there is, did he run out of clay"?
I just put five dollars in the jukebox.
We got a Paula Cole rock block coming our way.
I'm just so thankful, you know?
Here we are, beautiful as all heck.
Normal to above-normal endowments.
- That's right.
- It's like why were we given so much while others were given so little?
I don't understand.
You know, I look at you and I see a stunning physical specimen.
It's like you were created in a la in a lab.
Full of gay scientists.
You have a perfect body, my friend.
You're like the only Jewish Greek god Hercules.
- Thanks, buddy.
- You're cute as a button, bro.
- Appreciate that.
- You're swoll, my friend.
- No, look, I work at it.
- You're super swoll.
No, it's something I work at.
- No, I mean that, though.
- It doesn't happen overnight.
It's something that I put the work in, - just like you do.
- You look good, dude.
We're blessed, the two of us.
- Beyond blessed.
- Just I feel like we should be doing more to share our beauty with the world.
- Right?
- It's frustrating.
- It's fru it's frustrating.
- So frustrating.
Let me ask you something, guys, have you ever considered modeling?
Now, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.
- That's crazy.
- What?
Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.
Modeling is a real job and, trust me, neither one of you could do it.
- What?
- Give me a break, Cece.
I could model in my sleep.
Modeling is exactly what these two should be doing.
I bet they would take some amazing pictures.
A drunk baby with a phone in its mouth couldn't take a bad picture of you two.
- Oh, well - I mean I mean, I mean.
Nick.
- Yeah.
- Nick, um, uh, I need out of the bet.
Yeah.
No, seriously, 'cause, he's coming out of the bathroom soon, and, um, he's actually He's the worst.
- So the date's not going well.
- I know what you're thinking.
It's not 'cause of the thing.
First of all, he's a street artist; second of all, - he called a scotch on the rocks a Sko Ro.
- Ooh, that hurts.
I can't date him for a month-- like, I can't even spend like, five minutes with him.
- Yeah.
- So you have to let me out of the bet, please.
You're saying a lot of words, but all I'm hearing is, "He's too small".
No.
It's not because of that.
He has a he has a tattoo that just says "Warrior Poet".
Sounds to me like you're being pretty shallow, Jess.
No.
He tipped the waiter with a sketch of a hip-hop mouse.
- He did?
- Yes!
That's incredible.
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?
Do you mind my if I graffiti your bathroom?
I want to paint a skylight on the floor that looks into hell.
Oh no, that's okay.
I'd prefer if you didn't.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.
Okay.
He's wearing skinny jeans.
They fit him like sweatpants.
Thinking of asking this lovely lady on a second date?
No diggity, no doubt.
We can go speaker shopping, drink some Sko Ros, if that's where the rhythm takes us Um, unfortunately, I will be out of town for the next month.
- Oh, for trues?
- Yeah, for trues.
Hello.
This drink is for you, from those gentlemen over there.
You the man.
Skol!
- Do you know those bros?
- Nope.
Anyway, I'm gonna be out of town for a month, but, uh, we can go out on another date, perhaps when I'm back.
Technically, our, um, one-month anniversary.
Jess, you're not going away for a month.
She keeps forgetting that that got canceled.
You're available.
No, but you keep forgetting it was rescheduled.
You weren't on the e-mail.
- Okay.
That doesn't sound for trues.
- For true.
You're not really going out of town, are you?
Oh, gosh.
Uh, Matt If I'm being honest, I don't think we should go on a second date.
- I get it.
- Yeah.
- It's because of my micropenis.
- No!
I looked it up and I-I actually feel like I could make that work.
No, it's Don't take this the wrong way, but it's actually your personality and everything about you.
You think I'm a douche bag.
You said that you thought street art was the closest thing to an education homeless people would ever get.
- Okay.
- And I when I asked you, "Is that a joke"?
You said - Your mom is a joke.
- Yeah.
You said, "Your mom is a joke".
Right?
That's kind of a douchey response.
I'm really sorry.
I mean, I've been made fun of my entire life-- in school, in locker rooms-- so, yeah, I can be a douche bag sometimes.
But I'm this way because of my micropenis.
Later.
- Radiant.
- Yes, yes.
You don't even need this bounce board.
- You're making your own light, man.
- No doubt, no doubt.
- Winston, you getting this?
- Oh, hell, yeah, dude.
I'm getting all of this.
- Flawless.
- Yeah, there you go.
All right.
Now give me some stuff like it's the first day of school, right?
- Okay.
- That's right, and you got your backpack on.
Yeah, there you go.
But you packed your own lunch.
But what you don't know is when you were making it, you got some mustard on your forehead.
That's right.
Now you're playing Pictionary, okay?
Now you're playing Pictionary, and what do you Ooh, now I got now I got my little card.
What am I gonna draw?
What am I gonna draw?
You get sardines.
They don't smell good.
How do I draw a smell?
How do I draw a smell?
What does that look like?
That's modeling.
That's right.
- Wow, this is great.
- Hey, give me five.
I got to protein-load.
What do you see we split that last packet of Power Goo.
I cannot believe that this actually worked.
- Oh, man - No, that's a lie-- I would've been surprised if it didn't.
A classic Cece-Winston Mess Around.
- That's not a thing.
- All right.
So, guys, I was looking at the shots here, and they're really incredible.
I think I could call my modeling agent, if you want.
I know this we're-we're, like, just doing this for fun and everything, but part of me wants that to happen more than anything else in the whole wide world.
No, but my agent probably would only want one of you, and you guys are a team, so I shouldn't call.
- Hold on.
- You don't want to be rude to the man.
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't want to see you guys pitted against each other.
- P-Pitted against each other?
- What are you talking about?
I think, you know I'm more runway.
He's more - Yeah, I feel like I'm more catalog, - catalog, - high fashion.
- back of the mag.
You're t you're too big for high fashion.
Also, my agent really loves piggyback shots, so - We should piggyback.
- We'll piggyback right now.
- Let me get on, man.
- You get on me.
- I didn't know you guys had it in you.
- I want to be on the bottom.
- Let me be on the bottom.
- Yeah, yeah, you're a little piggy.
- Bottom's my game, dude.
- No, me You went to the market.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Little piggy went to the market.
- Just let me - Damn it.
- Oh, yeah.
No.
It's like shooting candy into a baby.
- That's it.
That's it.
- Yeah, give me that.
Give me that!
I could I could I can totally dig this.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
I know you're bummed and so I hate to do this, but I want to look at porn and you owe me a year's worth.
Yeah, okay.
You know what?
You earned this porn.
And the VIP pass.
And the "Kitty Room Live Cam Experience".
Do you really need all of this?
Just click the boxes.
Matt was right.
I am shallow.
It's like I jumped to a conclusion about him, but I didn't have the whole story.
I thought I was better than you guys.
- But I'm a superficial size queen.
- Hey, guys?
Can you tell Schmidt that my portfolio is way better than his portfolio?
Look at that: I'm better wet, I'm better dry, my sexy baby is way more believable than his.
Watch, look-- Mama change baby 'cause baby made a dirty Okay, mine is way more sexy.
There are people lining up in the streets - to have sex with my baby.
- Liar!
I don't like this.
You can't use that photo, unless you're planning on posing for the Tiny Nipples of America Foundation.
Yeah, you're one to talk, little Miss Princess Waist!
Hey, I'm a 26!
That's normal!
- Yeah, in Asia.
- Who's talking to you, depression-era garbage man?
I've been holding that in for two years.
- I said one thing.
- Guys, stop attacking each other!
Come on.
He's making fun of you 'cause he feels sensitive about his geisha waist.
And you're putting him down 'cause you've got those cute little kitten teats.
Everybody has something.
She's right, you know.
She's right.
Look, I grew up fat, and I have scars that you can't see.
And I'm not talking about the stretch marks that I had removed by laser beams.
No matter how many miles I run, I'll never outrun that feeling.
Damn, son.
I didn't even know it was like that.
It'll always be like that, my man.
Still better than having a micro penis.
So much better.
Yeah.
- It's true.
Guys!
- We're all covered in micro penises.
- No, I'm not.
- Come again?
No, thank you.
- I don't want to be covered in anything.
- No, it's not true.
Yes!
Yes!
No!
We all have flaws!
We're all freaks!
All of us.
We have to support each other!
I knew it!
I am better than you guys.
Thank you for helping me realize that.
I know now why I was superficial.
It's because I was scared.
Of my micro No.
No!
Of mine.
What?
!
I'm saying that we should all celebrate our flaws!
Together!
I'm saying that The one day I wear jeans.
I'm saying, look.
We're exactly the same.
I'm sorry, what-what am I looking at?
This monstrosity the doctors call a knee that I didn't know was a problem till, like, three days ago.
What the hell is this?
!
You have a girlfriend?
He did!
How can no, no, no!
How dare you!
That's War Question Mark!
How dare you don't answer me!
Think I should go.
You owe me $12,000!
Wait, wait Jess, I can explain.
Okay, why are you not running after your girlfriend right now?
If I'm being totally honest, she was getting a little fat.
No, she was That's crazy!
I wouldn't behave like this if someone, just once just once, took the time to get to know You're not even crying!
You are unbelievable!
Is anything about you real?
Anything?
Do you even have a micro penis, or is that?
It it looks like a little tiny pigeon's egg.
Don't you want to hatch the bird?
No, I definitely, definitely do not.
You're you're a very complicated person.
but I'm glad I met you.
Sort of.
I mean, I don't know why, but I kind of am.
Anyway, take care of that little rug-rat.
He needs you.
Hey, man.
I'm just, uh It's all right.
I'm just, I'm just looking over some of the pics from today.
I don't know which one to send to the agent.
I've narrowed it down to 60.
- I can take a look at 'em.
- Yeah, okay.
Just tell me what you think about a couple of these.
I just, I don't know what's what at this point.
This "Hot Guy with a Kidnapped Son" He really looks like he's never gonna find his son.
"Classical Guitarist Loses a Shoe".
That guy's never gonna find his shoe.
I don't know.
This is "Cuddles With Tigers".
It's good.
This is "How Did I Get Up Here"?
What do you think about this one?
"Kiss the Cook".
See, I like "Kiss the Cook".
- It's catalogue.
- His lips are popping.
There's an accessibility with this one that I feel like Schmidt, relax.
I'm bowing out.
- I want you to have this.
- Come on.
What?
!
Why are you doing that, Coach?
Because you obviously need this more than I do.
When you look in the mirror, you see a fat kid.
I don't.
I don't know how that feels.
I do.
It's my micro-p, yo.
If there's anything that could finally help you get over your body image issues, it's modeling.
- That's for sure.
- Yeah.
'Cause you're not a fat kid anymore, man.
You are a model.
- Now, say it.
- I don't know.
- Say, "I'm a model".
- I'm a model.
- Say it louder.
- It doesn't feel real.
I need to hear you say it, or else I'm not gonna believe it, man.
I'm just saying, it's hard I'm a model.
- That's better.
- Hold on.
- I'm a model.
- Good.
- I'm a male model - You are a male model.
- I'm a male model!
- What is happening?
- What did we do?
- I don't know.
Thanks, Coach.
Now, go journal.
- I'm gonna go journal.
- Right on, man.
What's going on with you two?
What?
!
Nothing.
Man, we just being mega-cool over here.
What is going on, guys?
!
Wait.
Hold hold on.
Was all this a classic Cece and Winston mess-around?
!
- No!
- Yes.
Yeah.
Do not acknowledge that is a thing.
It's not a thing.
Now, look, okay, look, we got a little carried away, but how are we supposed to know he was gonna get emotionally invested?
This will destroy him.
You know that, right?
You two got to make him a model.
I did not mean to hurt Schmidt, okay?
But I can't make him into a model!
Not in modern-day America.
In 1970s Israel maybe.
Get it done.
I hate when Schmidt cries.
Sounds like a ghost singing "Hey Ya"!
*Hey ya* *Hey ya, oh, oh-oh * *I want to be your daddy* Fix it!
It's glorious, isn't it?
How did this happen?
Are there just no laws in Koreatown?
Uh, well, uh, Cece's agent saw Schmidt's portfolio and loved it.
Yeah, yeah, he, uh He fast-tracked it.
That-that's an industry term.
So, what am I selling here anyway?
Oh, uh, you know,uh, - Korean-Jewish interrelations.
- All right.
I wanted to tell you that, um, the bank cancelled my credit card after I ordered you porn.
That's okay, I wanted to cancel it anyway.
- You paying for it kind of killed it for me.
- Yeah.
Just made me sad for everybody involved.
I wanted to give those girls a hug and say, "Wipe your face, go back to school, honey".
So, guys, when does Schmidt get paid for this?
Well the agency is pretty tapped after spending $1,887 on this billboard.
Well, why don't the Jew-Koreans pay for it?
Well, it's an international thing.
- See?
So, there's fees.
- Yeah, but you said he would get a check for $500.
Yes!
Congrats, bro.
You deserve that $500.
Let's head out.
I think I'm gonna stay here for a little bit, - take this all in.
- All right.
Tell me more about this Internet porn.
Is there anything I would like?
Like something with a story, you know?
I don't think you'd like it.
Nothing about Victorian England or anything like that?
Oh, there's some stuff, I don't think you would like it.
Millionaire!

Fascinating.

It's ringing.
- Whoa, that's cool.
- Just like the movies.
We should answer it with, like, really funny voices.
- Yeah.
- We don't know who it is.

Yeah.
Oh oh.
Next time it rings, we should answer it.
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- It's Jess.
Just can't stop looking at this thing.
Man, I used to be so great at talking on the phone, man.
You know, something about the cord and the handset that just really set me at ease.
- You were weirdly smooth.
- If you slow dance with Nick, I'll hold hands with Amy.
Just make sure she cut her fingernails, though.
Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.
- I'm just being stupid.
- Tell her I'll make her a mix tape.
It was going great, by the way.
If this isn't sexy, I don't know what the heck is.
Something just came over him.
- He was amazing.
- I'm just excited to add a third number: Home, work and cell.
Damn, I'm reachable.
I'm definitely gonna mention that in my profile in Business, Man!
Magazine.
- Businessman Magazine?
- No, no, no.
Business, Man!
Magazine.
I've gotten a lot of heat from working on the sponge account.
I'm telling you, this is the first step in my quest - to becoming a millionaire.
- Well, I think that's a weird plan, but let's drink to it Who's in?
No, come on, I got to study for my interview.
Oh, I would, man, but I got a lot of police stuff to study.
You know, like, roads, laws, bullets Be really nice if you guys spent some time and studied your friend Nick.
Pop quiz, hotshots.
- I miss you guys.
- I don't understand what you're saying, man.
Are you asking me a question?
For real, though, I miss you.
So we would just sit around and drink all day?
Aw, forget it, man!
I'm storming off.
Oh!
Good morning, Vice Principal Day speaking.
What?
Calm down!
What?
!
Coach?

Coach Are you sleeping with the school nurse?
Jess, are you crazy?
Of course I'm sleeping with the school nurse.
- What?
- Mazel tov.
- My man.
Much respect.
- Look at you getting up in there.
- Yeah.
Living the dream.
- Great.
- That's really hot, dude.
- That's really great.
For me.
We have to fill out a form declaring our relationship?
Yes, it's a legal thing.
We're just covering our asses.
While you uncover yours.
Sorry, that was an unfortunate joke.
Um, anyway, uh, how did this start?
Uh, fine.
A couple of weeks ago I got a cut.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I went to the nurse.
- Okay.
- And when I saw her, I was like, "damn".
And I was, like, "you frickin' got a cut".
And I was like, "you frickin' better fix it".
And she was like, "no.
Cuts are gross".
- Yeah.
- And then we had sex.
Yeah.
That's disturbing on so many levels.
Um, I'm sorry, but your outfit looks like you got it at a Halloween store.
Thank you.
Coach got it for me.
It's a child's medium.
What'd you put for "nature of relationship" "Girlfriend"?
Well, that's what I actually wanted to talk to you about.
- 'Cause, uh, we hadn't - Question mark?
Um, it didn't feel like a question mark when you put a calamari on my finger like an engagement ring.
That didn't seem like a question mark to you?
Jess, someone's in my parking spot again.
- Not now, Rose.
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey.
- Last night was really fun.
I found your swim trunks.
- They're ruined.
Really fun.
- Ah, come on.
Yeah?
I thought you ditched this bitch.
I will send your weave right back to the loom!
- Oh, no, no.
Excuse me?
- Guys - Oh, yeah!
- Ladies, stop.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- See what you did?
- This is a different form.
All right.
Settle down, I'm coming.
Hello?
No, Schmidt's not here.
No one's here.
I'm here by myself.
Because I work at night, which means I'm probably the one who should answer the phone during the day.
Great, yeah, I'll tell him.
Great, she get a phone so Nick can answer it.
What?
I'm busy.
Winston's not here.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Okay, I'll pass it on.
Okay, you too.
My gentlemen, I'm glad you're home.
I got your messages.
All right, here you go.
- Wow.
Are these alphabetized?
- Yeah, you're welcome.
I felt like a secretary.
It was pretty awesome.
Some auto body shop called, Schmidt Apparently you're getting a spoiler?
I'm not getting a sp I just wanted a quote.
Yeah, I get a quote just in case I do want to actually buy one.
And it's nice to have a price before you get emotionally invested.
It's called predicting desires.
What I wish I would have said is when I first said it "Spoiler alert".
I wish it when I I wish I would have said, um, "you're getting a spoiler.
- Spoiler alert".
- I don't think that would have helped.
I just I'm just getting a quote, okay?
It's really none of your business.
Definitely noted.
Thanks, my man.
For the Winston, uh Who's this Gal Judy?
I've never heard of her.
She called twice.
- Who is this woman?
- She's nobody.
Doesn't sound like nobody.
Where'd you guys meet?
- At the driving range.
- The driving range?
- But you don't golf.
- Uh, I like to watch?
Winston, you go to the driving range just to watch?
- Yeah.
- Very strange, very strange.
Let's get back to this Judy character, because I am interested.
- You made love to her yet?
- I don't know.
Leave me alone, dude.
Honestly, stop.
That's not even a big d I don't even like her that much, all right?
- Just, ugh.
I'm probably gonna dump her.
- Do you want to talk about it?
Just kidding.
I'm messing with you.
Are you guys having as much fun as I'm having right now?
This landline has really brought us together in a great way.
I miss this.
Hey, if I cooked up a whole chicken, would you guys have some?
Those look like two hungry faces Wow.
That was intrusive.
Winston, how do you not know if you'd made love to someone?
I'm mad at you, Jess.
Why'd you put me on blast like that?
Because you shouldn't be sleeping with other teachers, Coach, let alone two.
Who are you, Blanche from Golden Girls?
Honestly, it took me a while to figure out who I was in that school, but I finally did.
- Who?
- I'm the guy who has sex with everyone.
Why can't you be the guy who loves recycling?
!
Everyone loves that guy.
This is a school.
It's a sexy place, Jess.
Look at that CPR poster.
It's hot as crap.
What the?
Why aren't they wearing shirts?
Are they drinking wine?
Mm That's it!
I'm gonna need to talk to all these teachers.
You're just jealous because you're not gettin' any.
When's the last time someone gave you CPR?
Well, I give it to myself at least once a month To refresh.
I'm talking about real CPR!
Look, you work in a school.
You need to have boundaries.
You have to be a professional.
Ah, Miss Day.
There's someone here I'd like you to meet.
This is Ryan.
He's gonna be taking over the science class.
Now, don't be alarmed, but his voice is gonna sound kind of funny.
It's because he's British.
Say something to her.
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.
Ah.
Oh, charming.
Hi.
It's a How do you do?
You must be, um Mister - "Gos Gosin-Yure".

What!

I'm sorry, I'm gonna make a note of how to pronounce it.
It's really nice to meet you, Mr. Goes-In Ryan.

- What is happening right now?
I'm just giving you guys your midday update.
Schmidt, dry-cleaner company called.
- Your socks are ready.
- Oh, great.
Not quite sure why we need to be on a conference call for this.
Not quite sure why you need to dry-clean your socks, you weirdo, but we'll get back to that.
Winston, Judy called again.
And so, I told her you weren't feeling it.
Now why would you do that?
You said you were gonna dump her.
It was a very difficult conversation for you.
We all know how you are, so I just handled it.
You're welcome.
Hey, Nick, do I need to be on for this?
Can I get off?
Greta, great, great.
You know what?
Now she's gonna do something crazy.
You know, this is a very emotional woman we're dealing with, all right?
- That bitch a leo!
- Can I go now?
You should have thought of that before you dumped her.
- I didn't!
You did!
- Because that's what you wanted.
I don't know what I want!
Judy didn't know what you wanted, either!
Oh, and Schmidt, the magazine called.
And they need a picture.
But don't worry.
I handled it.
- What do you mean, you handled it?
- I know you have a lot on your plate, so don't worry I sent them the most recent picture I had.
- The most recent one?
- Did Judy sound?
Winston, enough!
Nick, what, what do you mean by "the most recent"?
I don't I don't understand what that - The latest picture.
- It's the most accurate.
It's just good marketing.
You know that.
Check your e-mail.
You'll be happy.
Did you check it?
Is it loaded?
Oh, no, no, no!
And that's all I got.
You guys good?
Okay, I'll check back in five.

- Winston!
- Hello.
I said Winston I said "yo".
Wait.
Who's this?
It's Schmidt!
We got to do something about Nick.
We're here to address the school policies on interfaculty relations.
Some forms of touching, say, a a friendly handshake, or a spirited pat, are completely appropriate.
What if you spill coffee on your pants, and you're very burnt, and upon getting your pants cut off by paramedics, you become aroused?
I'm truly hoping that didn't happen.
What if you're in a situation where you either have to um Grab a teacher's crotch, or give narcotics to a student?
- That's a great question, man.
- Thanks, friend.
- Not a great question.
- And what if you?
I'm done with you.
If you feel things getting sexual Just say, "shut it down"!
Followed by a sweeping gesture with your hands, like such.
Everyone do it with me.
Shut it down!
- No, thanks.
- It's kind of fun.
Shut it down.
Shut it Down.
Thank Thank you, new guy.
- Yes, Coach.
- See, I'm more of a visual learner.
Oh, yeah, you are.
- Do you think you could maybe demonstrate that move in context?
- Really, Coach?
- I think we'd all like that.
It's kind of like a - Like a skit.
- What?
!
- No idea.
- Visual learning.
- Like a skit.
- Visual learning.
- Show us!
Do it!
- Visual learning!
Okay, Coach, do you want to come up and help me?
How about the new guy?
British people love doing stuff, right?
No, I don't think - British guy doing stuff!
- Yeah.
British guy doing stuff!
I'm telling you they don't like to do things.
- Doing stuff!
- The British are coming!
- Okay, okay.
- Happy to help.
Mr "Guzinya" and I will now act out a sexual scenario.
It's "Goes-In-You".
Yeah.
I know.
- Okay, let's try it again.
- All right, all right.
- Hello.
You've reached the loft.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Too sexy!
- Sounds good to me.
- Are you out of your mind?
I'm on fire right now.
This is a home.
We're not selling lubricant.
Why aren't one of you doing this?
Because we couldn't decide which of us to do it, and this way, it's fair.
Put nothing on it.
Flat as can be.
All right, here we go.
Flat as can be.
Just say the words.
- Hello.
You've reached the loft.
- Oh, my God!
Will you not stop until the whole world is aroused?
!
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Nick, my man, looking good.
- There he is.
- New set of PJs?
- I know what you're doing.
You're blowing hot air up in between my butt cheeks.
And I'm no idiot.
I know I was let go 'cause of the dang old machine.
Story as old as time.
A new piece of technology comes around, and all the peasants freak out.
But one prince knows what's going on, "Don't trust the technology"!
And all you peasants trust it, and then the machine becomes self-aware and destroys you all.
And then, I become the loneliest prince of all, laughing in my golden tower.
Isn't that a movie?
- Maybe I stole that from war games, yeah.
- Short Circuit.
- No, it isn't.
- Man, you know what's a good movie?
Splash.
I don't know what is happening.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Let's see what she can do.
Hello.
You've reached the loft.
Oh, my God.
Will you not stop until the whole world is aro?
Hey, this message is for Nick.
You responded to my ad about a custom secretary headset.
Please give me a call back.
How do they know my name?
It's a stinking old prank.
I don't even care.
I got a lot going on today, so Are you just eating a bowl of jelly?
- What does it look like?
- It looks like a bowl of jelly.
It's a bowl of jelly, yeah.
Okay, so say I'm in the library and I feel Mr. G.'S hands on my shoulders.
I'm not interested.
So what do I do?
I say, "shut it down".
Does that make things more clear for you?
I feel like it needs to be a little more real, you know what I mean?
I feel like if he were to touch her, that would help, am I right?
Am I crazy for thinking that?
No, right?
Yeah.
Just It'll be more helpful if he were to touch her.
Just touch her, man.
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, he should touch her.
Touch her!
- Get in there!
Touch her.
- Okay, fine.
Um So I'm in the library and, uh, Ryan approaches Hello.
You look tense.
With that accent.
Sha, na, na.
Mmm Day-o.
A little lower.
Right in the wolf patch.

- Should I shut it down?
What?
Yes.
Yes!
Shut it down!
- I touched your I thatwas - That's fine.
It's-it's cool.
Nice to meet you, too.
That was an accident.
And when an accident happens, shut it down.
- I did it again.
- That's what I'm talking about!
I think we need to fill out some forms.
Why won't these messages play, Winston?
- The machine's on the Fritz.
- Just don't tell Nick.
The magazine was supposed to call today and set up my interview.
I'm as mad as a dad in traffic!
You probably burnt it out.
I mean, you listened to Cece's message 100 times.
I know.
Then I touched my peen.
There he is.
All right, Nick, hey, uh, you were home today.
Did anybody leave any messages about my interview for tomorrow?
I don't know.
Why don't you ask the machine?
Isn't that what you wanted?
Uh, the machine's not working.
Isn't that funny?
I feel like I'm working perfectly.
I'm gonna go take this machine back to 1993 and exchange it.
Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- The magazine.
They called.
They left a message.
They want to do the interview today.
Why didn't you say anything?
That thing is super important to him.
You know how much this interview meant to him.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
Yeah.
First you break up with Judy and now this?
Why are you so obsessed with answering the phone?
Man.
We're just peeling the onion all the way to the middle, aren't we?
What's going on?
Just because I miss you guys.
And I didn't know what was going on with your lives and now I do, and it-it made me feel connected to you.
I'm not gonna lie to you, man, that got me.
Hello?
This is Nick.
No, I'm sorry.
Schmidt isn't here.
No, he didn't Pl H Can you hold on one second?
It's the magazine.
- They want to cancel the interview.
- What?
They want to do it right now or not at all.
Yeah, this is Nick again.
No, he-he did He might Hold on one second.
I hear something.
That might be him.
Please hold.
- You've got to talk to 'em.
- Why do I have to talk?
Because even though you're the most awkward person I've ever met, you're magic on the phone and you know it.
- You know, I put those days behind me - Schmidt's right here.
Hold one sec.
You have to do it.
For Schmidt.
I need a soda, I need a straw and I need to get horizontal, so get out of my way.
Yeah, this is Schmidt.
What up?
I read.
The last book I read.
Good question, good question.
Uh, some biography with, uh, Carson Daly.
The one with the red cover.
Yes, that Carson Daly Joint.
You know, I respect that dude.
Yeah, he's just like me.
He's always on.
There's not a lot of good white role models out there, and I say that as a white man.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, you got it, Business, Man!
Is that the magazine?
What are you boobs do - What are you.
Winston, get off the phone.
- Stop, stop, stop.
Stop.
Shh!
Trust us.
What does marketing mean to Schmidt?
This was the spoiler.
What did it say?
Uh - Predicting desires.
- Predicting desires.
Well, to me, it's all about predicting desires and finding buyers, you feel me?
- He's really good on the phone.
- Did you know that my name was an acronym?
Uh-huh.
Schmidt: Some can have money, I desire thoughtfulness.
Schmidt don't quit!
Hey, Coach.
- Hey.
- I just came in here to say I'm sorry.
Sometimes it's Hard to control your feelings.
Which I demonstrated by Grabbing a man's "Dujeels" in front of the entire faculty.
Well, I'm sorry for putting you in a position to grab that man's "Dujeels".
I don't like saying "Dujeels".
It's weird.
I call mine my Sam Jackson 'cause he's in everything.
I just don't know how to face Ryan again.
I was so unprofessional.
Jess, you're the Vice Principal, and you're a great Vice Principal.
Doesn't mean you're not a human being.
Thanks.
Oh And you'll be happy to know I've repealed the policy.
You have?
That's frickin' awesome.
- Ruth.
- Hi.
It's hot under there.
Happy to know you two have patched things up.
- Yeah, we have.
- Oh, they've been patched.
Two times.
I see your hand moving, and I Wish you'd wait till I left the room.
My bad.
Hey.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry.
Um, my hands are Staying behind my back, don't worry.
I won't even look at it.
I mean, I-I looked at it just 'cause I said it, but I Uh hmm, yeah.
I was gonna ask you Vice Principal?
A moment, please?
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
- Um, my boss.
- Good seeing you.
- I'll, uh, see you around.
- I hope so.
Principal Foster, I am so sorry.
I went overboard.
- First off, it's "Dog".
- Dog.
Secondly, do not apologize.
I have tried to corral these animals myself.
- It's impossible.
- Word.
These teachers are straight-up ho's, Dog.
Sometimes you just got to let people follow their urges.
Yes.
- I completely agree.
- It's too bad we can't.
- We can't?
- Absolutely not.
We're administrators, B. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.
Two administrators?
Perfectly fine.
But, unfortunately, as I've repeatedly told you, - I'm not attracted to you.
- Right.
- You like asians.
- So Exactly.
- So that's off the table.
- Yeah.
So, do us both a favor Lock up that lobster.
I still can't believe it.
Look at that.
"Bringing nasty back".
"The bad boy of marketing".
- That is cool.
- So great for my brand.
I mean, I always knew I was a bad boy, but now it's in print - and it's official.
- Don't call yourself a bad boy.
- Am I a bad boy?
- You're not a bad boy.
Winston!
Winston!
Winston!
Yep.
It's Judy.
Hey, it's Nick!
We talked on the phone!
'Sup?
Thanks, Nick.
Winston!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Cece went on a date last night?
Schmidt, why don't you just read my text messages while I'm in the shower like you normally do?
Our Cece has taken a lover?
Good for him.
- Don't get weird, Schmidt.
- I'm not being weird.
I just said good for him.
You know, I've camped in that forest, too The babbling brook, the beautiful mountains, little secret trailway that's only open seasonally, and when it is, let me tell you something, bring a camera.
Cool, not weird at all.
Good, you're all here.
I just got a tip from my buddy Dugan.
My academy background check is today and I need - everybody's help.
- Can't do it, bro.
Going to the outlet mall today.
I'm gonna look like - a rich person from three years ago.
- Can't You can't go - to the outlet mall today.
Not today.
- Yeah, you can't - go to the outlet mall today.
- Why?
It's a weekend what are you, crazy?
Unless you - got a game plan.
- I have a game plan.
Grab a quick smoothie, power up.
Do my leg stores first.
Pants, socks, shoes.
Hats and accessories last, then one sweet treat for the road.
Most likely a cinnamon pretzel.
- I'm in.
- That sounds like a tight afternoon.
- I'm in for sure.
- What the hell, dude?
I do want to be part of the pretzel.
This is my life.
If I don't pass the background check, then I fail out of the police academy.
Guys, this is an all-hands-on-deck situation.
If we don't help him, Winston will never become a cop.
Remember?
He-He handcuffed his cat's paw to a radiator and then lost the key.
In my defense, I was making a Christmas card, so Okay, you know what I'm gonna cancel my plans with Cece.
I'll find out about her date with Paul later.
A ridiculous name.
Oh, hey, my name is Puh-ha Pau - I don't even know how to pronounce that.
- It's Paul.
I'll take that Paul, I'll take him to a water park, I will.
I'll put him on one of those waterslides between two obese people and he'll get smushed to death.
Die in a Die in a water He'll die between - the obese people before he drowns in the water.
- What?
- Hmm?
- Schmidt, that is exactly the kind of talk we can't have today when the LAPD comes here.
Um the, uh, cops are coming here?
- Yes.
- Like, here, here?
- Yes.
- Like, to our home, w-where we keep our stuff?
Why can't we just go there?
We'll just go there, a-answer some questions, get an ice coffee - on the way back I really feel like ice coffee.
- It's a home visit, Jess.
And not just from any cop.
It's from Sergeant Tess Dorado.
The Fish.
I'm pretty sure they call her The Fish because she's tough but fair, - just like most fish I've interacted with.
- Winston, "Dorado" is a fish.
It's a subset of mahi-mahi and it pairs very nicely - with citrus, you oaf.
- I'm not a oaf, you're a oaf, stupid.
- So You're dumb.
Shut up.
- Also, put on some underpants, please.
It's like a bounce house down there.
Do you guys think that the cops are gonna go through our stuff?
What are you afraid of?
They'll look through your dream journal?
- No, I just - What, are you running a sweatshop back there for skirts that look like curtains?
- Actually - What'd you-What'd you, steal a kiss and hide it in an envelope?
I have a bag of meth in my closet.
Oh, I know it's in here somewhere Oh, oh, ooh.
These are my "bad decision" hats.
- Bad decision, right?
- How do you - not know where a bag of meth is?
- Find it and get rid of it.
- Find it, get rid of it.
- Jess, why do you have meth in your closet?
Do you remember that day when I was trying to convince you guys to come with me to that waffle restaurant in the Antelope Valley that I found?
And you were like, "That's way too far to go for waffles".
Turns out you were right How good can a waffle really be?
- That's the question I answered that - Tell us the story faster.
- Your waffle story sucks.
- Where is the bag of crystal methamphetamine, you dummy?
Okay, fine.
Do you see that footstool?
I bought it at a garage sale.
Turns out the top opens up and when I opened up the top, I found here it is this.
Holy frickin' what?
Aah!
- Oh, hey.
How do I look?
- Terrible.
- N-Not for me.
- Not great.
- Like crap.
- Go change.
- I don't like any of it.
Wow.
You guys are like rubbing alcohol.
You sting me in the now, but save me in the later.
- All right.
- Okay, Winston cannot find out about this.
Because if he doesn't know, he can't get in trouble, and he's probably already failing out of the academy as it is.
Also, why are you keeping this in your closet?
What am I supposed to do, notify the authorities?
I'm sorry, Officer, I found this bag of meth in a footstool I bought at a garage sale.
Uh, no.
My closet is safe.
The only person who goes in there is me when I'm naked and/or sad.
Hey.
Much better, right?
I found it on the lawn.
And that's the whole story.
So, you guys ready?
She's on her way.
Why don't you go wait for her downstairs?
Don't make her buzz up like a shawarma boy.
Good idea, good idea.
This way, I get to tell her my sidewalk joke.
You remember the sidewalk joke, right?
There's a man on the s How's it?
There's a man on the Oh, you know, okay Everybody just calm down.
Especially you, Nick, you're already sopping wet.
Lying makes me sweat.
I can't lie.
It's why I don't play poker or talk to pregnant ladies.
No one has to lie.
I'm just going to get rid of it.
I'm gonna call Cece.
She knows about this stuff.
She lived one summer in Milan with a guy named Crystal Randy.
- Ask her about the date.
- Hey, Cece, quick question.
How does one get rid of a bag of meth?
Call me back.
- Ask her if Paul is taller than me.
- Stop it.
- Did she surrender her virtue?
- Hey.
- Throw it in the trash.
- I can't see it.
I can't see where it goes, 'cause then when she comes in here, I'll just yell "trash"!
I'll yell "trash"!
Cover your ears and sing "Landslide".
- Let's call Cece again.
- # Took my love and I took it down d We need to get this back in my closet I could see your lips moving.
Well, close your eyes.
Throw it out the window, okay?
I'll sneak down there, I'll toss it in the Dumpster.
Here.
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!
- What the heck, Jess?
- I threw like a boy!
- I've always thrown like a boy!
- You almost hit me in the face!
- What are you, nuts?
- Overhand?
Oh, well, Winston's a goner.
You know, this building used to be a biscuit factory.
And apparently, the mice have not been told it's gone residential.
Was that a joke?
I hate jokes.
- # of changing - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- # 'Cause I built - We just have to hide this.
- # My whole life around you - Throw it in here.
- Come on!
- I was bringing it to you!
Why does everybody keep asking me to throw stuff?
Work on your aim!
- This is actually a really good song.
- Nick, stop singing!
- Where are we gonna put this?
- Put it in the baggie!
Fun Saturday?
No.
My bird died.
Well, my mom used to say when a bird dies, he gets another set of wings in heaven, so Well, that bird was going straight to hell.
Welcome to our home.
I will ask you questions.
You will ask me no questions.
In pursuit of that, I will offer up three personal facts: I was born in St. Louis, I have three brothers, two of whom were killed in separate plane crashes, and I like music.
Good?
Good.
Now, let's get started My name is Nick.
Nicholas Miller?
I-I don't I don't know.
Hah!
He's just messing around with you.
He's our resident clown here.
Let's keep this simple.
I need to be home in time to feed my bird.
Oh, God.
Uh, green grape?
Would you like?
No, thanks.
I already had my grapes.
Jess!
I got your message.
Where's the freaking me Play along, or Jess goes to jail.
- What are you doing?
- Hey.
Look, it's my girlfriend Cece.
- What's up, Cece?
- Ah, it's his girlfriend Cece.
Girlfriend?
Oh, my goodness, you guys are back together?
- Yeah.
- No, uh Like I always say, you can't put peanut butter and jelly on the same shelf and expect 'em not to mix.
'Cause somebody got to eat a sandwich.
- It's exciting.
- Yeah, no.
Moving on.
Miss Day, in your own words, please state why Cadet Bishop would be an asset to the Los Angeles Police Department.
- A few kind words.
Known me for a long time.
- Yeah.
- It's your boy Winnie the Bish.
- Oh!
I have to go to the bathroom.
If you guys will excuse me for just one second.
Okay.
Will somebody answer the question so I can write it on the form and we can get on with our lives?
Why would Bishop make a good police officer?
- Mustache.
- I'm sorry?
Because, uh, Winston has a mustache.
And, uh, police officers all have mustaches.
No, they don't.
Not the ladies.
Unless the ladies want to.
Why can't a lady have a mustache?
She can.
And it would look sexy.
Would you like a green grape shoved in your given to your mouth?
Handed to your mouth?
I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.
- No, he-he would.
He definitely would.
- Yeah, he would.
You know, Winston has done plenty for, uh, the, um community.
He has a little brother at the Boys & Girls Club.
Of course.
All the work that Winston does with the Boys & Girls Club that he actually does in real life.
- So much work at the Boys & Girls Club.
- Yeah.
So passionate.
What was his little brother's name again?
- Duke.
- Juan.
- Duquan is his name.
- Duquan.
Duquan.
Duquan.
And I'm Nick Miller.
Hey, let me ask you s um Hmm?
Breasts.
- It's my cycle.
- Already?
Damn, girl.
My calendar is way off on you.
You must be, what, like, ten days early?
Aw, Winston.
Someday you're gonna make some lucky girl really uncomfortable.
Can you go get Cece and tell her to meet me in the bathroom?
Sure.
And, girl, uh, you ain't got a cycle you got a roller coaster.
- Don't I know it, girl?
- Mm-hmm.
Duquan Feldman?
I'm gonna make a note to call the Boys & Girls Club.
- No!
- Why not?
Uh, because he's coming here.
Why would why would Duquan come-come here?
Because he comes here every Saturday.
- He does?
- Then where is he?
- Huh?
- It's Saturday.
Where is he?
He's at the bus station.
He's waiting for, uh, one of us to get him, and, uh You know what?
I'll go do it.
You guys stay put.
You're gonna go and get Duquan?
I think so.
Yeah.
You guys, anybody want to come with?
No?
Where are you, Duquan?
Hey.
Cece, Jess needs some help - with some lady stuff.
- Of course.
You know how we do.
Whoof Gonna - Must be a rough one.
- You know what, I'm gonna have a look around.
What a great i You know what, you should start with Nick and I's room.
We share it.
Hey, don't mind the condoms.
We've been banging like rabbits.
Not each other.
What are you doing?
Jessica.
No, Jessica!
What are you doing?
You do not put drugs down the shower drain.
Have you never seen a drug movie before?
- I don't know.
I saw Ray.
- That does not count.
I might have ruined Winston's chances of being a cop.
Well, we can cry about that later.
We are gonna take the drugs now and we're gonna go flush 'em, all right?
What are you doing?
Come on.
Help me.
Pick up the drugs, Jess.
I think that the meth entered my bloodstream - through my boob skin.
- That is not a thing.
- That's not how drugs work.
- I'm the one on meth!
Don't tell me how drugs work!
Okay.
Oh, my God.
Could you open this trunk?
Oh, I'll do more than open it.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm gonna open the trunk.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
What are you Oh, my God.
You're a mess.
Here.
- Cover up.
Cover - No, I'm not putting that I'm not putting - on your kimono.
It legitimizes you owning it.
- Just put it on.
- Put it on.
- Okay.
I'm wearing a kimono.
I see that.
Why?
Why?
Why is he still wearing pants?
That's the real question.
What's all that going on out there?
I'm on drugs.
I'm on drugs What's all that clanging?
Uh, just a bunch of clanging.
Well, there's feminine issues It's probably the ladies playing with their jewelry.
- Their brooches.
- You know how Brooches.
Of course.
Nick makes a very good point.
I'm gonna go check on that right now, actually.
Uh, Winston, why don't you show the good sergeant - Jess' room?
- What?
- What a great idea.
- Oh, I've had intercourse in there.
You'll be excited to - I think I'm gonna take off, too.
- Nick, what is going on out there?
- What's going on out there?
- No, I'm asking you what's going on.
- Hmm?
- What's going on?
It's gonna be okay.
Hey, what happened to the "turlet"?
Schmidt, you're here.
So we're in a little bit of a thing right now, but you're our best cleaner.
We might be out of towels, but you'll figure out something.
- Right?
It's gonna be fun.
- Jess, - are you crying right now?
- I don't know.
I hadn't noticed.
Um - I might be on drugs.
- You gonna help mop - or are you just gonna try to kiss me again?
- Oh, please.
You kissed me back.
Your I felt your lips surrender.
And who's this Paul anyway?
Paul.
- What, does he work in a pizzeria?
- Yes, Schmidt, I went on a date with a guy named Paul.
- You just need to get over it.
- Paul.
Paul.
Nice name, dude.
- Why is your shirt off?
- I've seen New Jack City, okay?
They all take their shirts off in the crack cocaine lab!
Ah, it won't go down!
Hats off to the hillbilly that made this meth.
Meth?
What meth?
This meth.
It's legal meth.
It's medical meth.
For my cramps.
Wait a minute.
Who's with Nick?
d I took my love and I took it down d d I drove around and I hit a pound d d And I saw all the puppies with their d d Eyes so blind Nick!
Nick!
Sergeant Dorado, don't listen to him!
He's deranged!
I'm gonna talk to this man alone.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That is not good.
No.
So, this Paul I've never seen someone sweat so much in my life.
It looks like your body is crying.
What are you hiding?
Distraction!
Okay.
You're a tough cookie.
And that's the last thing I'll say.
- Look - Okay, you want the truth?
I'll tell you everything.
When I was 13 years old, I once made love to myself behind a post office.
Oh.
Hey!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Yo!
What's up?
You in the shorts.
Hey, come here, man.
Come here.
I need a little boy.
Whoa.
No.
That's not what I meant.
No, no, no.
I didn't mean You know what I'm Ah.
I wasn't trying to It's for my friend, you know?
I need you to come over to, uh, hang out with my friends.
No, not like that.
I just need you to pretend like, uh, you're in a relationship with this grown man that I know.
Ah!
Ah!
Uh, I did not think this through.
Did not think this through.
Um, bad decision.
Very bad decision.
I'm gonna go now.
Don't remember my face.
Forget this face.
This didn't happen.
What is wrong with the name Paul, okay?
Paul is a normal name.
He is a normal guy.
That is the problem, okay?
You shouldn't be with a normal guy.
All right, okay.
It was Mark-Paul Gosselaar.
What?
You you were you were with Zack Morris?
- Mm-hmm.
- Guy's a frigging god.
I mean, all right.
I've I surrender.
That's awes Can I come to the wedding?
You think Slater and Screech are gonna be there?
I'm kidding.
I just wanted to freak you out.
You really had me going there for a second.
It works every time with you.
It's amazing.
Now There was a real second there where I had bad feelings towards Mark-Paul Gosselaar, and I didn't like any moment of that.
How dare you.
Don't ever do that to me again.
When I was nine years old, I fed cereal flakes to a frog, and it died.
Then I went into a period of time where I fed cereal flakes to all little animals.
Squirrels can live through it, chipmunks can live through it.
Anything that lives half in and out of water dies, and I don't understand why.
When I was ten, I once walked by my mother sleeping, and I snuck in the room, and I put a lemon in her mouth.
When I was 11, I once tried on my girl cousin's wool tights, and I didn't hate the way it felt!
Why are you telling me this?
Because you said you wanted to hear everything!
My sixteenth year, I never got an erection.
I thought they were done.
I thought my penis was dead.
It wasn't.
It's fine, Winston.
We can fix this.
Just help me mule this crank.
I'll prepare, you mule.
I can't mule crank.
I don't have the system.
It's the perfect plan.
I don't think it is.
Jess, do you know how much time we could get for possessing this much meth?
Why'd you hide it from me?
- I was trying to protect you.
- I should've been the first person you told!
I could've taken care of it, or something.
- Now it just looks like we're hiding it.
- I just I didn't I didn't think there was anything you could do.
And-and why is that?
Because I don't know!
Because you don't see me as a cop.
None of you do.
I didn't I didn't think you'd make it this far.
We always thought you'd change your mind.
I mean you say a prayer every time you get on a escalator.
Why risk it?
- I just never really saw you as a as a cop.
Sorry.
Oh, there it is.
Okay.
Okay.
You know what?
I know exactly what I have to do.
- I'm gonna tell her it's mine.
- What?
!
No.
No.
Yes.
Maybe I'm not supposed to be a cop.
There's no reason you should lose your job, too.
I once changed a sign that said "Happy Jewish New Year" to "Happy Newish Jew Year".
Is that a hate crime?
Stop talking, stop sweating.
What is wrong with you people?
!
Enough!
Sarge, I have something I need to tell you.
Wait!
Sergeant!
My name is Jessica Day, and this is my meth.
- What?
!
Jess, No.
I won't accept that.
So The bathroom is covered in meth.
Meth that belongs to me.
And it may have intoxicated me through the skin on my breasts.
But I assure you, no one here had any prior knowledge of any of this.
Especially Winston.
And I don't want him to go down for my mistake.
You'd be lucky to have him as a cop.
Take me downtown to the all-lady fur factory.
Okay, cuff me.
Somebody bring me handcuffs.
I'm guilty.
Is she cuffing me?
I can't see what's going on up there.
Do you feel anything?
Does meth make you feel, like, normal, but, like like your face feels, like, scratchy?
Oh, no, that's just the carpet on my face.
Here's the way this is gonna go down.
I'm gonna go in the bathroom, have a look around.
You will stay here.
You will not move, you will not talk, you will not think unless they're thoughts about not moving.
Winston, I'm so sorry.
I ruined everything.
You would have been such a good cop.
You would have made someone really lucky to have you as a partner.
I always imagined I'd have a partner named Robertson.
- That would have been perfect.
- Yeah.
"Robertson, you're on the edge!
- You've gone too far"!
- No, no, no.
See, the thing about me and Robertson is that we're tight.
You know, then I went ahead and slept with his wife.
- I don't know why - Why would you do that?
I don't know why I would do that.
The job really gets to you.
You know, it's stressful out there.
This might not be the right moment but for what it's worth, I did it.
- I kept a secret.
- Well, congratulations, Nick.
You have the willpower of a six-year-old.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry about the whole kissing thing.
Oh, you don't have to apologize.
I did kiss you back a little.
- So, should we tell Paul together?
- Oh.
Well, what do you think he's doing right now?
Do you think he's explaining to the air-brusher that that really is his name?
Paul?
And that he wants that painted across the back of his denim jacket?
It's a normal name.
Hey, Nick?
When I'm in prison, write, dance, sing live your life.
And if you come and visit me in jail, please don't wear that robe.
It's a kimono.
Well, this is a first.
These are aquarium rocks.
So, that's the street name for No.
These are actual aquarium rocks.
You were trying to flush rocks down your toilet.
Oh, what?
!
- Oh.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
That's great!
Yes!
Awesome!
So we're not going to prison?
So, did Winston pass the background check?
Of course.
He's one of our best cadets.
His test scores are high, he's passionate, hardworking.
He's gonna make one hell of a cop.
But he won't work in narcotics.
You get to be a cop!
Yay!
Congrat congrat Congratulate Really?
No, we're celebrating Winston.
- Celebrating Winston.
Okay.
- All right, we'll celebrate Winston.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
Please consider moving.
I have no idea why you live with these people.
What kind of person would urinate on an electrical socket?
I I thought it would make lightning.
- I told you that wouldn't work, Nick.
- Hey!
Guess who's here like he normally is every Saturday!
It's Duquan!
Big brother Wimstons.
Oh.
I love you, Mr. Wimstons.
I go from no hope to hope.
He take me and he says to me, "You're gonna be somebody.
"You-You could be the presidents, or Statues of Liberties".
- Is that right?
- We make homework togethers.
He buys me toys, and we chase each others, and we laugh at the sun.
This feels good, man.
Yeah.
Like I got a new friend.
- Me, too.
- Duquan.
- Right.
- Hanging out.
It's Jose, so Yeah, I like Duquan, though.
Yeah, but my name's Jose.
Like outlet malls?
- I love outlet malls.
- Ah, me, too, man.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
That's awesome.
On the weekend, though?
Mm.
Yeah, but I mean, I have a strategy, you know.
Like, I start out with a smoothie, and then do my leg stores first.
- Then, I Yeah.
- I do the same, but I end it with pretzel.
- Pretzel.
I - Shut up.
- Cinnamon pretzel?
- Oh, my God.
- Dude, don't, don't,.
- No, you don't.
- Don't.
- No, you don't.
You want to play a tickle game?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Gentlemen!
Three months ago I bravely reentered the dating pool, and how has this city rewarded me?
With an endless parade of weirdo ass clowns.
Hard to say who was the worst.
- Comedy magician.
- This guy with the little ding dang.
- The lion tamer.
- Never went out with a lion tamer.
I am having some vivid dreams.
The point is Ian has asked me out on a third date, and this is the biggest compliment I could give.
I want to go.
Because I like him.
- Booh!
- That's not a reason.
And frankly it's been a while, and the third date is where, mama gets her biscuit.
- Mama gets her biscuit.
- I don't understand.
- It's sex.
- Oh!
- Yeah!
- Now, that's a reason!
Anyway, I'm bringing him home tonight, so let's keep those toilets flushed.
That means stick around.
Take a second look.
How'd you tell Ian about the fun surprise that you still live with your ex?
All right.
Well, I haven't told him yet.
Uh, tricky conversation.
I'm thinking of something simple like, "Hey, Ian, I live with my ex".
No.
No, no.
When a guy hears that, he is going to run through the wall like the Kool-Aid Man.
Here's a fun idea.
You can put a hat on him with antlers.
This way, the hole he makes in the wall will make us all smile.
Nick brings home girls all the time.
- There's no problem.
- No complaints here.
It'll make you forget every botanical garden you've ever seen.
I live with my ex-girlfriend.
And after the farmer's market I live with my ex.
Let's have sex again.
I live with my ex.
Damn it.
Too quick.
Hey, if you're looking to scare somebody off, it's basically a gold mine.
Nobody cares that we're exes who live together.
I got to go.
Okay, that doesn't prove anything.
Just for the record, I'm leaving 'cause you live with your ex.
It's gross.
And disgusting.
And I'm gonna steal some stuff.
Take what you want, honey.
We don't read those anymore.
Nick, who are these girls?
They're not the best.
Jess, guys hate complicated situations.
We want the path of least resistance.
There's a flap in our underwear because we are too lazy to pull our underpants down.
No offense, Nick, but Ian's a little different from you or the women you bring home.
The tavern folk.
Have some respect.
They're called Uh-Ohs.
And I've been through a lot of names: Pork Pals, Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Bone Cronies, Right.
C-Plussy Hussies.
Very reverent.
But "Uh-Oh" takes it off of them and back onto me where it belongs.
I made the mistake, not them.
They're great.
You really are a prince among men, Nick.
Aw, that's awfully nice.
I feel like I'm maturing.
All I'm saying is that, somehow, Ian is even more mature than you are.
And that's why I think he'll understand when I tell him in a mature adult way I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about.
- Can I suggest a tweak?
- Fine.
"I live with my ex but there's nothing to worry about because he's gay now".
No.
"Because he has weeks to live".
No.
"Because he's already dead".
- What?
- Then I'll act like a ghost.
No.
Consider it.
- No.
- Come on.
That's the worst ghost impression I've ever heard.
This is the worst ghost impression you've ever heard?
I'm a ghost.
There's way worse.
Anything for me?
Oh, no, this isn't our mail.
This is our neighbors' mail.
You see, Viv likes it alphabetized.
Yet Michelle likes it according to size.
Hashtag "go figure," right?
Hashtag "did you see how I rhymed"?
I want to choke you until your eyes literally pop out of your head.
Those girls are not going to sleep with you.
They are hot.
And nothing is less hot than a male secretary.
What?
I think somebody needs to take a good long look at Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.
Dude's eyes are so pouchy he can barely see anything, and he's still killing it.
Girls don't have sex with guys who sort their mail.
I am playing the long game here, Coach, weaving myself into the fabric of their lives.
Pretty soon I'll be as permanent as the will that I helped them draw up.
Oh, Winston, thank God you're here.
The toilet won't flush.
Did you jiggle the handle?
No, it's not working for us.
- Here.
- Oh.
I'm not here to do any chores.
You guys want to hang out tonight?
- Sure.
- Sure.
- Right on.
Right on.
That's what's up.
Coach, I really need my stilts and a plunger!
Eh, I don't care.
I'm happy to lend you a bra, but I don't think I have anything that would fit you.
That's the Peter Pan.
That'll smash 'em down good, but you'll never get those in there.
I know.
I just wanted to see what it would feel like to be your size.
Are we doing, like, a boob Freaky Friday?
Because I don't want to lug yours around.
They're a load.
I know.
That's the whole point.
That's why all the women in my family have back trouble, you know?
So, now that I have insurance though, I was thinking maybe I could have, like, breast reduction surgery.
No!
I wonder who this is.
What?
It's a boob reduction, Schmidt.
Just accept it.
Acceptance is stage five.
I'm grieving, Cece.
There are five stages of grief.
Stage one was denial.
- This is not happening, this is not - Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.
- You're not getting a boob reduction.
- Yes, I am.
- This is not happening.
- Yes, it is.
Stage two was anger.
Your breasts belong to all of us!
Okay.
Who are you to decide?
!
Next will be stage four, depression.
And then stage five, acceptance.
But right now, I'm firmly planted in stage three, bargaining.
Dear God, if you stop Cece's breast reduction, Okay.
- I'll circumcise Coach.
- Whoa, Coach.
Go out with them tonight?
Doesn't make any sense, man.
And compromise the long game?
Ha.
Not until I replace their rocker switches with dimmers.
Forget your long game, Winston!
Getting a girl to have sex with you is not about planning ahead.
It is about seizing opportunities that you never saw coming.
It is instinct.
All right?
It is improv.
It is jazz, man.
But with words.
You dig?
And the words are, "Oh, yeah, girl, I'm about to" Glen, my man, tell me something good.
And you better not be trying to sell me some non-dimmable halogens, you son of a Where you at?
Are you kidding me?
Hey, buddy.
You know what you need to surround yourself with tonight?
Four new boobs.
On two different women?
You're damn right.
Take me to them.
Um, do you want to, like, go find a bar, grab a drink?
There's a bar that I like.
It's called my place.
Great.
Uh, is it You think it'll be crowded?
You know I'm talking about my house, right?
Okay.
Yeah, no, I wasn't I thought that was just - a clever name but now I do.
- No.
And, yeah, let's go there.
Um, one thing I want to, uh, disclose to you in a very mature adult way, I live with my ex.
- Okay.
Uh, yeah, you live with your ex.
- Yeah.
But also three other guys.
It's more zany than sexy.
Okay.
So it, like, wasn't really serious?
Oh, it was very serious.
Did you say "I love you"?
Not until he said it.
Uh, yeah, I don't think I can do this.
- I'm sorry.
I just - What?
I've been on so many weird dates lately.
I'm just looking - for something easier.
- I No, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, Ian, look.
Yes, I live with my ex.
But there's nothing to worry about.
Because Nick.
You're gay.
- Huh?
- You're gay.
Be gay.
Be gay.
Be gay.
Be gay?
Hey.
I just had to make sure these animals flushed.
Oh.
Not you, you fastidious queen.
Oh, y-you must be Nick.
Well, friends call me Gay Nick.
My perfect Sunday, sitting here watching the game, eating a pot pie with a hot dude with no shirt on, on my lap kissing me.
Right on, man.
Right on, man.
- All right.
- You got it.
Uh, can I use your restroom?
Yeah.
It's down the hall to the right.
Don't worry.
I won't peek.
But he wants to.
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I should just tell him the truth.
It's too late for the truth, Jess.
You live with a gay man, and this gay man's gonna help you get laid.
- Okay.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you think you can play a gay man?
I'm terrible at lying, I'm terrific at make-believe.
- Okay.
- Okay?
But I need to know some backstory 'cause it's very important to me.
- Okay.
Yeah, backstory's important.
- Okay.
Tell me, have I always known I was gay, or did I just recently realize it?
That's Um, you-you always knew you were gay, but you grew up in an oil town where masculinity was the most valued currency.
Um, you-you had an older brother named Chip.
- And Chip was a union guy.
- Yes.
And if it wasn't about Teamster Local 11, Chip didn't want to hear about it.
Oh, my God, we're doing this.
When I came out, was it flashy?
Was it emotional?
Am I mad that Anderson Cooper doesn't fly the flag?
Or for what he's doing in his own way is it even braver?
These are all really good questions, but I just can't get my mind off, like, why you dress this way.
- Why aren't you in better shape?
- Don't put me in a box!
There's nothing we gay men hate more than being put in a box.
Look, maybe I'm a bear, maybe I'm a twinkler.
- That's not a category.
- I like rugby for the game and for the men.
Now, if you excuse me, I got to go do that gay thing I was telling you about, because, of course, I'm gay as hell.
Bye.
That's not how gay men talk.
I am shattering stereotypes.
What are you doing here, man?
I'm always here.
Very definition of the long game.
Forget your long game.
It doesn't What is he?
What are you doing, man?
Is this?
Is this the fut the future?
I can hold them both in one hand.
Yeah, man.
No, no, there it is.
Look at that.
Stage four depression.
My two best friends are going away.
Going away far too soon.
And if you were lucky enough to meet them, to touch them, to be touched by them, you came away a better person.
If you'll excuse me.
Is he is he talking about you guys?
Yes.
Yes, he is, uh he's talking about us.
We are, unfortunately, we're going away tomorrow.
So, uh, we better make tonight count, huh, ladies?
Wait.
We barely got to know you!
How long will you be gone?
For for - 44 weeks.
- 44 weeks?
Tell them about our business, man.
You don't have to be shy about it.
- Uh, right.
- No.
Yeah.
Hello.
Do you like socks?
We sell socks.
Everybody likes socks.
- I just cried on my penis while I was peeing.
- Whoa.
That happened.
I just can't stop thinking about them.
You know, there are some people that are gonna say that they they look alike.
That they're exactly the same.
And you know what?
They just don't know them like I know them.
Truth-truth be told?
One of them One of them is slightly more brown than the other.
And they're so unique, and they're so special.
You know what I'm gonna miss most about them?
Watching them bounce.
Watching them Watching them bounce.
If you just give me a chance to exp Well, easy come, easy go.
Easy?
Easy?
!
You just stole six months of my life, man.
I am I am P.O.'d, hombre!
Winston!
- Can I get a high five?
- Bam.
Sorry I called you a biscuit.
I'm sorry I liked it so much.
Hey, Jess, you in there?
Is that Nick?
Do you mean Gay Nick?
Yeah, that's Gay Nick.
- I am so sorry.
- What's going on?
I screwed up.
- A girl, Nick?
- I know.
Nick, really?
Hey.
You look like my dead friend Karen.
- Does anyone ever tell you that?
- Hmm, no.
- Thank you.
- Mm.
What?
!
I wanted to be gay for you, I really did, but it's a very hard time to be gay.
Girls are wearing scarves and boots.
They have so many layers to them.
What is underneath all those layers?
I want to find out!
Are you blaming autumn?
Look, it was one night.
Get rid of her!
I tried.
I told her I live with my ex, and she didn't care.
You look so cute in the morning.
You talking to me or her?
Okay.
I'll get rid of her.
I'll just pretend to be your crazy ex-girlfriend.
I can do this.
I did a one-woman production of A Christmas Carol.
You, sir, what day is it?
Aye, it's Christmas day.
That was not good.
- It was perfect.
- Thank you.
I thought you'd think that.
- Yeah, it's perfect.
- All right, look, you stay here and keep your gay warm, okay?
In case Ian comes back.
Also, can we agree that this is not the most mature way to handle things?
Even though it's pretty fun.
It's no fun a couple Bellinis and a round of apples to apples can't solve.
- What kind of gay are you?
- I'm still finding it.
- All right.
- All right.
Nick thinks we're broken up, but he also thinks that the last girl he slept with wasn't me in a wig.
Wigs are so good for tricking guys.
I'm around all the time.
Do you really want to get yourself in this situation?
My last boyfriend was, like, honestly in his 80s.
I was just like, "Don't die, Myron".
Does that answer your question?
Tell me everything you did sexually!
Everything!
All of it, or leave!
- I put my finger - Stop!
- But you asked - No.
I-I did, but it backfired.
Ah, so it is load bearing, huh?
What are you doing?
Me?
Oh, well, first, I'm putting up the shelves.
Then I got to finish the floor, so that the shelves can appear level, then the ceiling.
Enough!
All right?
You've done enough for these women.
Look, ladies, I tried to manipulate you, and I am sorry about that, but you guys have been manipulating my friend for months.
It is not okay.
Just dangling sex like a little carrot.
We are not using sex to get Winston to do stuff.
No.
- Wait.
You're not?
- No.
Well, then he's done doing stuff.
Come on, Winston.
You're better than this.
Forget you guys.
Wait!
Yeah, just-just give us a minute.
- Okay, we have to talk about - Okay.
- What are they whispering about?
- I don't know.
We could just stack the books.
No No.
Oh, man, this is embarrassing.
Uh Okay.
It's me.
Come on.
What?
Wait.
Listen.
Um Michelle, you don't have to do this.
That's okay.
I kind of want to.
Just, uh, keep the pencil behind your ear, and bring the hard hat, um, and the safety goggles.
Long game.
Wonder what's taking, uh, Jess so long.
Well, you know women.
What's women?
Am I right?
"What's women"?
I just don't know them like you know them, is my point.
Uh-huh.
Uh, so, what kind of guys do you like to date?
Me?
All kinds.
Yeah.
Hunks.
If I can get my, uh, paws on a hunk, I don't let go.
Uh, ripped nerds.
'Cause they're smart but strong, I guess.
- Uh-huh.
- I like Spanish guys.
Throw in a little, uh, hint of German in there, there's a perfect combo.
Okay.
Certain ice cream men, I guess.
Carpet steamers.
Sleepy guys.
Uh, we in the gay community call them "drowsers".
Why would you like a sleepy guy?
Look I'm so out of the game I'm in a relationship.
Um he's got a nice penis.
You're sweating a lot.
That's what he said!
Am I right?
I'm a sweaty lover, is what he says to me.
Okay, you know, you really don't seem gay.
I don't buy it.
Hey.
Not now.
Probably wondering why I didn't come home last night.
Just needed some space to process this whole thing.
I'm sorry if our room felt empty.
Well, it did.
I was really worried about you.
So where were you?
You owe me that much.
I just went walking on the streets last night.
I needed to come to terms with all this.
Ended up in a park.
I know that's stupid, but I promise I was careful.
I mean, I was totally safe.
A park?
- I don't know, man.
- Hey, I'm upset but I understand.
It's okay.
Come here.
Come here.
There, there.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Acceptance.
Wow.
Yeah.
Give me a kiss.
Just give me a kiss.
All right?
I felt like you needed that more than I did.
You're scruff, by the way, is perfect.
- Don't touch your beard trimming setting.
- Okay.
- Take it easy.
- Okay.
That was beautiful.
I'm-I'm sorry, you know?
I think I'm just more used to, like, stereotypical gay guys, like him, you know?
- You offended me.
- I'm sorry.
Ian!
Ian!
Hi.
There are some events that are about to occur that I'd like to get ahead of.
Um, the truth is that Nick is Oh, God.
Get off of me!
You're not a man!
Ian!
Wait.
I'm so sorry I lied, and you don't owe me anything, but could I just ask you one thing before you leave?
- What is this, an exit interview?
- Is there any good way I could have told you about my living situation?
Okay, you know what?
Fair question.
Um no!
Look, Nick was just trying to help me.
Clearly, he would do anything for you.
I mean, he went so far as to hire an actual gay man to play his cheating lover.
What?
Oh, my God.
You know what?
I think that was Schmidt.
He's not gay.
When are the lies gonna stop?
!
Now, this is just a consultation, so do your best to relax.
Okay.
Stop the surgery!
This is just a consultation.
May we have the room, please?
That's what it's here for.
I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
!
- Okay, look, I know I can't stop this, and I accept that, but I just wanted to stop it long enough so that I could say good-bye.
Aw.
Look, this is a low-risk procedure, okay?
I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, you meant say good-bye to my boobs.
I forgot who I was talking to.
No, Schmidt, you cannot see my boobs.
I need to look them in the eyes.
I can't let them leave without knowing how much they've meant to me.
- I'll let them know.
- No.
I need to tell them myself.
All right you can say good-bye to one, all right?
- I mean, j-just one?
- One.
Gosh almighty.
The Ultimate Sophie's Cho-Cho.
I mean, there's Harold, who's just full of life And Kumar, who's shy.
Who's shy, but yet surprisingly so brave.
But, you know, who wouldn't be with a best friend like Harold?
Oh, my God, fine!
You can say good-bye to both, okay?
- Okay.
I need you to put these on.
- What?
This is a private conversation that doesn't concern you.
The playlist matches the mood.
I mean, I guess if I'm being honest, it doesn't matter what size you are.
I'm always gonna love you, because you're attached to the most beautiful person in the whole world.
You know what I think?
I think that when people go on dates with us, probably talk to their friends and their friends say, "You go on dates with a lot of weirdos".
Oh, my God.
We're the weirdo ass clowns.
Aw, no.
Everyone in their 30s waits in line for the shower.
I'm sorry, but the truth is, as long as you live with me, you're not gonna meet a normal guy.
Why are you guys all in here?
Winston's taking a long-ass shower.
Poor guy gets dirty.
All right, let me see the new.
I accept it.
Again, it was just a consultation.
And actually, I don't even know if I'm gonna go through with it.
You're still here.
I saved you.
I'm your Schindler.
One day, your children are gonna put rocks on my grave.
Hey, uh, wow.
You guys mind if I get cuts?
- 'Cause I am very dirty.
- Wait a minute.
Who's in the sh Hey, what's the vibe here on shower pee-pee?
I'm just trying to plan my day.
Who is this woman?
!
You have awesome water pressure.
You should see what's falling out of my hair.
Well, Nick looks like you're gonna have to marry her.
- It's looking that way, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- She's not so bad.
- She's peeing in the shower.
- Yeah, she is.
- That's weird.
Classic Tina.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Oh, the female reproductive system.
Kind of looks like the Chicago Bulls symbol.
- It does.
- Now, this is the only part that matters.
- The money train.
Sure.
- Hey, I call it my nine-to-five.
'Cause it's my job to work it.
You know what I'm saying?
The large intestine, you degenerates.
What?
- Let me see that.
- I told Jess that I don't want to teach health.
I'm not good at it.
Such a hassle.
Studying, planning, giving weak kids good grades.
No.
I heard that.
There are good things, too.
Like you get to come with me to a dope two-day teaching conference in Palmdale.
- I want to stay and hang out with the guys at Guys' Night.
- What's Guys' Night?
Oh, yeah, we're celebrating you being gone.
No offense.
- Guys' Night!
- Guys' Night!
Guys' Night!
The conference is gonna be really fun.
We just have to work from, like, 9:00 to 7:00.
And then after that it's a par-tay.
Until 10:00, when quiet hours are strictly enforced.
But before then we rage.
For three hours.
Actually, two because there's the half an hour of setup time and the half an hour of cleanup time because we have to actually be in bed at 10:00.
Ooh!
Are you kidding me?
Ryan is going?
Ryan-Ryan?
The guy you have a crazy crush on?
I had a crush on him.
Principal Foster says that administrators can't date teachers.
It's forbidden.
That makes it so much hotter.
It makes it crazy hotter.
But, look, it's not just about Principal Foster.
This is about how I worked really hard to get to Vice Principal, and I'm not gonna let some British guy get in my way.
Some redcoat bastard.
That's why I keep all of our interactions strictly professional.
Hey.
How was your weekend?
That's personal.
I can't risk learning any personal details about him.
What if he taught his dyslexic sister how to read?
I can't know that.
I'll go crazy with lust.
- My pants will turn to ash.
- And so exactly how do you plan to avoid this man that you are trapped in the same hotel with?
There are, like, a thousand porns that start that way.
Yeah, but no porns have teachers.
Every porn has a teacher.
Well, I'm not worried, okay?
'Cause I'll probably never even see him.
Jess?
Can you believe we're right next to each other?
- Hey, you guys want sangria?
- It's Guys' Night!
- Only beer!
- Yeah, what is this, Spain?
Great sangria burn, man.
- Really?
- Never let your guard down!
- Aah!
- Oh, takedown!
Never let your guard down.
- Well played.
- All right, first up, we eat meat.
How much meat?
!
Then we take a fart nap.
- Not for me.
Pass.
- All right, guys, - it's Guys' Night.
Let's think.
- Okay.
Anything else we can't do when Jess is here.
Wow.
- Look at that stretching.
- I don't want to make this sound too creepy, but I want to own those girls.
I wouldn't touch them.
They'd want for nothing.
But I would know they were there.
- Stretching.
For me.
- I want to French braid that girl hair.
I want to French braid that hair so good.
The third hottest one just waved at me.
Hello!
Ah!
- Ooh!
- Oh, no.
- Oh!
- No!
- No, no, no!
- Oh -Jess is gonna kill you.
- Shoot!
She's not gonna kill me.
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna have it cleaned, I'll have it cleaned.
- Schmidt, red wine sets.
- Shut up, Winston!
It sets.
Why don't you just wash it?
Why don't I just what?
Wash it.
Just wash the blanket.
Unless you can't.
Come on, man.
Get out of here.
I've known you for a lot of years and I've never seen you do laundry.
Never seen me do laundry Get out of town.
Wait, wait.
Is that true?
Come on, you guys, this is so Really, this is silly.
Then do it.
Right now.
We'll watch.
Doing the laundry It's no problemo.
Little bit of this.
What in the world?
Straining the soap.
Get that in there.
Back in there.
Um, okay.
And That's it.
Laundry.
Can't Oh, so silly.
Forgot to put the quarters in.
That's right, the quarters.
- Schmidt - All right!
I don't know how to do laundry!
- I knew it!
- Forget it.
- Finally!
- That is insane!
Hope you're happy.
Nerd.
Nerd.
Dud.
Lady nerd.
Goofus.
- Virgin - Hey, Coach, I need you to be my buffer!
Okay, but Nick can never find out about this.
Wait, what?
Hmm?
- What?
- What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I need you to be my buffer between Ryan and me.
He's so sexy.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That guy?
Beautiful.
Did you make that?
Looks like a Boys Department mannequin.
Yeah.
- Hey, Jess, can I, um - Nope.
No time for chatting.
We have to sit down.
You can't sit there.
Coach likes to sit in the middle.
Mm-hmm.
I sit bitch or I don't sit at all.
- You're weird.
- You're weird.
- You're a weirdo.
- You're weird.
- You're weird.
- You're weird.
Shh.
I am education guru Brenda Brown.
Oh, no.
Who is this?
She looks like one of those ladies who talks you into having a baby in a tub.
You.
the talker.
Mmm Stand up.
- Talk to us.
- There were other people talking, - I just want to let you know that.
- Why are you a teacher?
Uh, 'cause my my roommate made me.
Hmm.
What?
I'm worried about you.
You're a worry.
Wor why, why are you worried about me?
Teaching is an awesome responsibility.
You are not prepared for it.
Sit down.
Okay.
Today, we will learn about our fellow educators, their hopes, their dreams, their bitter regrets.
The things they wish they'd said to their birth mother So, partner up.
Will you be my partner?
Mmm, sorry, I'm with Coach.
No, I can't do it.
I'm going to the bar.
What?
- Buffer out.
Buffer out.
- No, buffer in.
Buffer in.
Buffer in.
Buffer out.
Everything okay here?
Yeah, sorry.
My, um my partner just left.
Or did your partner just arrive?
Oh.
Um No - Wicked.
- Everyone!
Look at your partner, really look.
Take his or her hand and say, "I'm excited"!
- I'm excited.
- Oh, crap.
We just came to say we're sorry.
Guess you think I'm pretty dim, huh?
A man who can't do laundry.
You weren't born this way, were you?
Born not knowing how to do laundry?
Like everyone else?
Yes, Winston, I was.
It wasn't till after birth - that the trouble really began.
- Here we go.
Nana wouldn't let me in the laundry room.
I think it's because my hands were always covered in butter.
And so I went to college unable to do laundry.
- I'm making jean shorts!
- I'm doing laundry!
- Big day for both of us!
- Yeah, it is.
As I pulled out my maternity corduroys, I spied a six-pack of Pi-Phis.
I need um I need them loose to keep to keep my sperm count up.
You know how it is!
Eventually, the window of time when it was acceptable to learn something so basic had closed.
I was an adult.
It was too late.
Well, I understand.
You know, I've never told anyone this, but, um I don't know how to read a ruler.
I don't, I mean, how do you start?
At the edge or the first tick?
- It's confusing to me.
- Are you serious?
- Do you know how to count?
- It always gets on top of me, and 'Cause then you should know how to use a ruler, you idiot!
I'm an idiot?
You can't even wash your own underwear, you dumbass.
Hey!
They're both super easy!
We're talking about laundry and a ruler!
I'm gonna teach you guys right now!
Let's go.
Each of you holds a stack of cards with questions for your partners.
You must uncover the answers.
Begin.
What gets you out of bed in the morning?
Let me guess.
Your mother, who you live with, says, "Ryan, your crumpets are getting cold".
The thought that any ordinary day could be the day I look back on when I'm much older as being the best day of my life.
You?
Same.
Don't look away.
- Embrace the intimacy - I'm good.
- Embrace the intimacy.
- Okay.
You know, I think there's an art to a picnic basket.
Apricot jam would never go with a sesame cracker.
Of course it wouldn't, it would go with - A flaky baguette.
- A flaky baguette.
Duck, duck.
Okay, now step forward, step forward, another step forward; okay, go to your right, go to your right.
Do you scrapbook?
On rainy days.
Step forward, go to your left; left, left.
Big step, that's it, big step; now come to me, another big step; come to me.
Do you own yarn?
Spools of it.
I craft so much.
It's a left, and again come to me, come to me.
- Yes.
- Come to me.
- Oh!
- Oh!
It's okay, I've got you.
We have a new record.
He's amazing.
I think he might be an angel sent down to Earth like Denzel Washington in The Preacher's Wife.
Oh, honey, okay, what can I do?
In your purse, you will find a white envelope.
Okay, you, you wrote a letter to yourself, and stuck it in my purse?
Read it, I need to hear it.
"Dear Jess, "If you are reading this, "it's because you're being an idiot "and developing feelings for your employee, you ballet-flat-wearing piece of Oregon trash".
You are so right.
You are so right.
"To have intercourse with the first man "hired under your reign would be an insult to yourself and also" This part's in caps.
- all women everywhere".
- All women everywhere.
"Did you learn nothing from the movie Elizabeth, you stupid little bitch"?
No one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects.
I will paint my face white.
No man may have me.
Thank you, Cece.
You're welcome?
Teaching is such a pain in the ass.
Isn't it?
I'll tell you what, I wouldn't give it up for anything.
You get to really impact those kids' lives.
I'm not gonna impact them, I'm just teaching health.
"Just health"?
- Hey, Carol.
- Hey, Ned.
- Oh, it's Carol.
- Oh, hey, Carol.
Health is the most important subject.
Screw up, and they "just" get pregnant.
What's your safe sex lesson plan?
I don't know!
Uh, lie to them and say condoms feel good?
Uh, maybe tell them about my buddy who's got bumps on his thing?
Maybe bring up Magic Johnson.
Maybe bring up Kobe Bryant.
You're my best friend in the whole world, but I'm really worried about you.
You think the line is a suggestion?
- I don't know what it is - It isn't!
- Do it again.
- It's too hard!
Do it again!
Okay, so you start with the first tick.
Oh That's it, really.
Stop!
That was at the line!
That was perfect.
Now do it ten more times.
So in the beginning, you never mind the edge.
- Yeah.
- Man.
You got to hold on to it.
- What about bleach?
- Let's walk before we can run, huh, pal?
Hey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!
Man, that is way too soon.
- Warm-warm, warm-cold - You got this, don't get flustered!
Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?
It's hot-hot!
- It's always warm-cold.
- Well, what's "permanent press"?
- Fake button, nobody uses it.
- Yeah, don't press that one.
The machine is buzzing, you didn't close it!
What?
!
Yeah, I closed it!
Who you gonna believe, me or the machine?
!
I'm gonna believe the machine!
This is bull!
Damn it, you!
We're so close.
Take ten and relax.
Nine-inch bottle.
Rappers be lying.
You told me to relax, so Self-pleasure is the only thing that relaxes me.
- Ugh.
Seriously, Schmidt?
- That is crass.
I don't want to hear it, I don't want to hear it.
So stupid.
Hey, you did it!
You did it!
Yes!
- Yeah!
- All right!
That's what I'm talking about!
Guys' Night!
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.
- I saved you a seat.
- Oh!
No.
I've been offered a seat at the higher-ups' table.
The tastemakers.
- You're not invited.
- Oh, I see.
You're back to avoiding me.
I'm not av I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
You've been avoiding me for weeks at school.
That's why I was so happy that we were finally getting a chance to, I don't know, maybe get to know each other.
What, is this summer camp?
- We don't need to get to know each other.
- What's your problem with me?
- Did I do something to offend you?
- Why do I I don't have a problem.
- You have a problem with me.
- I don't have a problem with you.
Yes, you do, you have a problem.
- Do you have a problem?
- No, I don't have a problem.
Great, then we bothdon't have a problem.
We have a problem.
Hey, Jess!
Buffer on the roof!
I'm freaking out.
Freakin', freakin' out.
Freak, freak, freak.
Is that a baby?
I feel like I hear a baby.
All right, gentlemen bar crawl.
Man, look at this, I know how to do laundry!
- I feel like a new man.
- Good, good, good.
There is no way for me to express my joy.
Except by telling you the width of my smile.
I can't read it, somebody else read it.
No, I want to do it, I want to do it, hold on.
But I can't see, let me turn it uh You know what?
To Nick.
What can't you do?
A lot, you know, I can't say "Frebuary".
No one can!
Frebuar Febuar-ar - Feb..
I - Whatever.
- Feb February.
- Yeah, it's February.
I can't say the alphabet unless I'm singing the song.
And I never learned how to love.
But enough about me Guys' Night!
Let's go, gentlemen.
Man, that is that is heavy.
Hey, Nick, that's something we should talk about.
I mean, what are we gonna do, sit around all night and talk about love?
I want to know what love is I want you to show me Ooh I want to know what love is Oh And I want you to sh - I know you can show me - Sad song.
Hey, buddy.
Hey!
What's happening?
I freaked out about the whole teaching health thing, and then I went and I-I got drunk with Ned Neddy!
And then I bet everybody in the bar that I could do a backflip off the roof, and that's what I came to do.
So Hey, look, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Uh, I I totally understand how you're feeling.
Yeah?
Does, uh, teaching scare the crap out of you, Jess?
Well, it is my life's calling, - so, no.
- Exactly.
- You don't get it.
- I do.
What's up, player?
It's the British dude.
This is my first time teaching, and I'm scared, too.
- It's a terribly important job.
- Yeah, but health is the most I'm good.
Health is the most important subject on Earth.
Yes, it is important.
'Cause you know kids, they're always wanting to have sex with each other.
They don't know that it just feels good for a second and then you're sad.
And that's why we need someone great, someone strong, who the kids trust.
Okay.
Someone who can yell at them about chlamydia.
That does that sounds like like something Coach would do.
- You can teach.
- I can teach, guys!
That's mostly what I was trying to tell you.
No one needs to worry about me anymore!
No!
- Oh, my God.
- I'll get him.
- No.
- Yes.
Don't do anything heroic right now.
This guy's amazing.
Hello Is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your I want to be the someone that somebody is looking for.
- In your smile - But what do I have to offer?
Do not talk about yourself like that.
Come on, guys, what do I bring to the table?
That's easy, man.
You're the cute one.
- What?
- That's right.
Look, I'm the smart one, Winston's the silly one, Coach is the sports one, and you're the cute one.
Well, if I were so cute, then how come I can't find anyone to love?
'Cause you're aiming too low.
Nick, my man, you don't find diamonds underground.
That's exactly where you find diamonds, Winston.
Let's can we not This is not about gems, okay?
This is about Nick valuing himself enough to aim for the top.
Now, I-I've been to the top of the mountain, with Cece, and it was glorious up there.
And you know, one of these days could be tomorrow I'm gonna be a millionaire.
If I don't have Cece, then what do I have?
You got a million dollars.
If I'm being honest, you guys, uh I'm worried about being a cop.
- Sure.
- You know, what if I see something really bad and then it it changes me?
You know, it makes me lose my faith and then I become really bad?
You guys really think I'm the cute one?
You know what's not cute?
Pretending that you don't know that you are.
Schmidt, this sangria is just delicious.
Thanks, man.
I'm jealous of that little orange in there.
It gets to just drink all the sangria it wants.
Yeah.
I'm probably gonna I'm gonna eat the orange, too.
- Guys' Night.
- Guys' Night!
It's like instant world music.
- Wait, shh.
- Why "shh"?
I think he's finally - asleep.
- Asleep.
Cheers.
Chin-chin.
Um Hey I'm sorry.
I was a little bit of a jerk to you earlier.
No, it's fine.
I'm used to jerks.
I used to work in finance.
Oh!
Finance!
- Mm-hmm.
- Really?
Why did you leave?
I know this sounds silly, but I realized that the only time I'd been really happy in my life was teaching my little sister how to read.
She suffers from crippling dyslexia.
- Oh, God!
- What?
You're just so perfect.
Well, it's more common than you might think.
No, you're like the most perfect person I've ever met.
And it's like you're an angel who's been sent down to the Earth, like have you ever seen the movie The Preacher's Wife?
Anyway, I just have this big, stupid crush on you.
I didn't say that.
- No, it's fine.
It's-it's - Shouldn't have said No.
I shouldn't have said that.
I'm sorry, um I need a bucket.
Now!
- Um, you should go.
- I need a bucket!
Just go.
No, let me help, please.
Let me help.
No, just go, just go, just go.
Ugh, gettin' the mouth sweats.
- Oh, I need a bucket!
- Just go.
- Just go.
Just go.
- Okay.
Why is there ice in here?
More room for what's about to happen - Oh, God - Oh, my God!
When I get home I'm hitting the books.
I am going to crush health.
- Yeah, you are.
- Yeah.
Ned!
Let me get his contact before we leave.
- What?
- Ned!
I need details, bro!
Hey, man.
Am I gonna get your e-mail?
- What's gonna happen here?
- Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Yeah.
It's therealned8@guhmail.com.
At guhmail you mean Gmail?
Oh, is that how you say it?
Um Good morning.
Good morning.
Can I, um talk to you about last night?
No, I want to talk to you about last night, because I said some things, um, that don't reflect how I really feel about you.
Um so I'd really appreciate it if you could strike them from the record.
It was the conference talking, not me.
Consider them struck.
Thank you.
Enjoy your Thanksgiving vacation.
It's, uh, an American holiday where we celebrate the fact that we didn't know how to farm by ourselves.
Are you curious to know how I really feel about you?
- No.
- Because if you were interested, I'd tell you that I won't enjoy my Thanksgiving because I won't get to see you every day.
I think you're beautiful and totally insane, and when I'm at work, I can't focus, because I can't get you out of my head.
Hey.
Hey, uh, you guys want to stop on the way home and get some pancakes?
Hey, what do you call them in England?
Roundy-yums.
Really?
No.
See you after the holidays.
Oh, boy.
You didn't see anything!
Where'd your lipstick go?
- Hit 'em!
Hit 'em!
- From the back.
- Hit 'em!
- Ugh!
It smells terrible in here!
How many beers did you guys drink?
- So much.
- Beer, beer!
Lots of beer.
Just a lot of beer.
- That's how beer smells.
- So many beers.
Smells like sangria.
That must be the perfume from all the ladies we hooked up with.
Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
-They were all Spaniards.
Mine was named SeÃ±orita Lucinda Madrid.
Say, how was the conference?
It was just stupid conferences Ugh.
So, she finally hooked up with Ryan.
He put his teeth behind her teeth.
Wow!
Aah!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
What the hell did you guys do to my blanket?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Friends, ex-girlfriend, Winston, months ago I warned you that winter was coming.
And for the cold and wretched days ahead, I stressed our need to take lovers - and take them quickly.
- Your head is huge.
Your hat's the size of a garbage can.
You look great in that hat, man.
What a hunk.
You look like Jewish Pharrell.
Th-Thank you very much.
I appreciate it.
Okay, now, winter is now here.
And I vow that we will not miss our final opportunity for sexual realization in 2014.
Did you steal my belt buckle, you Silly Billy?
Enough out of you, Winston!
Silly Billy?
Dude.
If you unzipped your face and an old white woman popped out, I would not be shocked.
- Really?
- No.
- I would.
- I would be very surprised.
That is why this year we will not be celebrating Thanksgiving.
Instead, we will be celebrating Remember last Thanksgiving when I almost died?
Bangsgiving!
We'll be celebrating Bangsgiving!
Why can't you let me just have this, you guys?
Please.
Okay.
You've been talking about this for, like, a week, Schmidt.
We get it.
Let's just pick names already.
Jess, I can't believe that you are into Bangsgiving.
I just want to meet a guy so I can forget about Ryan.
- Just date him, Jess.
- 'Cause I'm his boss, and it's against the rules for me to date him.
Just date him.
It's a dumb rule.
- It's against the rules.
- Take the hat.
- Oh.
- Now, whosever name you pick, that's who you'll be bringing a date for.
And no date leaves until everyone is laid.
I just want to meet a nice fella.
Can I have permission to send them home - without sex?
- No, you do not.
I think everybody's date should be able to leave.
Yeah, your plan sounds a little kidnappy.
What's the rule on that, Winston?
Eh, gray area.
We're good.
Winston is in.
My man.
And, okay, nobody say who you picked.
It'll ruin the surprise.
Oh, crap.
You picked me.
- No!
How'd you know?
- And now you're gonna set me up with you, aren't you?
Cece, I-I know that this holiday is a bittersweet memory for your people, - Wrong kind of Indian.
- but, please, do not take that out on me.
Okay, well, I picked you, too, so I want to re-pick.
No re-picking.
And no more telling.
So, listen up, uh, for whoever picked me, I just want you to know that I have really gotten into feet lately, - so do with that what you will.
- No one do anything with that.
- Can I just say no mustaches?
- I'd like someone tall.
- She's got to have an ass.
- Can I just reiterate the whole feet thing?
I want to say who I picked so bad.
I'm looking for a fake redhead.
With a medium-sized neck.
I just want to be slapped around.
So, Pearl, I told Winston that you work at my school.
And, um, Winston is about to become a cop, which you've probably already gathered from the fact that he pinned his badge to his sport coat.
What?
How did that get there?
Let me freshen your drink.
Excuse me a second.
Hey, Coach.
Coach.
Look at what Jess brought me.
Oh, Pearl?
Yeah, she's great, man.
Hey, come here.
You got something on your face.
- Really?
What is it?
- It's, like, right What were you thinking, bringing me that girl from the police academy?
What's wrong with Pepper?
Allow me Arms!
She's jacked, dude.
You should've warned me you were setting me up with one of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
I'm sure she's not that bad.
Whoa.
Where was she when I was cracking walnuts for the stuffing?
Look, she's fantastic.
She's beautiful.
You're gonna love her.
Now, if you jerks will excuse me, this Bishop's got to capture himself a queen.
She's doing push-ups.
For your lady.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Jess.
Pearl, she's Yeah, she's great.
What grade does she teach?
Oh, she doesn't teach.
She's the lunch lady.
- You said the lunch lady?
- Yeah.
So where exactly is this "date" of mine?
All right, I invited Lucy, like you asked.
Your date's name is Geoff and he will be here.
By the way, he spells Geoff with a "G," so you know he comes from money.
Well, I think the real difference is crocodiles are man-eaters - and alligators - What in the bloody hell?
Uh, hey, Nick.
What is Tran doing here?
Oh, well, I picked my own name.
So you said to bring somebody.
So I thought it'd be weird if I didn't bring someone.
So I just brought Tran.
You brought an old Asian man to my sex party so it wouldn't be weird?
Relax.
He didn't come empty-handed.
He brought a game.
It's like Thailand Monopoly.
Yeah, all the squares are jail except for one piece of property which we all have to fight each other for.
But don't get caught in the Red Light District.
- This isn't a freaking game night, Nick.
- Okay, chill out.
You You're making a mockery of this holiday and you know it.
I didn't mean to make fun of Thailand, if that's where you're from even.
- Hey.
- Lucy.
- It's so good to see you.
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm great.
- Lucy?
Lucy's here with Schmidt?
Where's my set-up, already?
I'm looking at the menu, and I see a lot of skirt but no steak.
I think that Coach picked you, so watch out.
'Cause I'm sure he's gonna bring one of his clients or weird, like, gym buddies.
Ryan.
- What?
- Ryan.
Ryan.
- Ryan-Ryan?
- He brought Ryan.
Oh, God.
I don't think I can even look at him, like, without getting pregnant.
He just oozes sex.
Good holiday to you!
I've come with biscuits!
Hey, hey, hey, Schmidt, Lucy?
- I-I used to date Lucy.
- Oh, I know, bro.
I met her that day you gave me the pass to your gym.
Hey, do you have any snacks?
!
Yeah, you blew her off.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
Oh, it's a problem.
I'm telling you it's a problem.
And I forbid you from dating her, so cut it off.
- Grounds?
- The statute of limitation hasn't expired.
You dated her three years ago for, like, two and a half months.
The statute is very specific.
1,000 showers.
After that, no claim.
And if you think I've showered 1,000 times in the past three years, then you're out of your mind.
Did you ever spend more than $65 on her, not including tip?
It's tough.
There were a lot of coupons involved.
Did you ever watch her dog?
Trick question: she had fish and I killed them.
You ever get her a gift?
Every time we had sex.
- No claim.
- No claim?
Hi, Nick.
It's been a long time.
Lucille.
Great to see you.
Do you still like to eat, uh popcorn?
- I guess so.
- Oh, you see that?
I know her foods.
You must have spoiled her, huh?
You know, if you'll excuse us, I'm gonna give Lucy the tour.
Come on, Lucy.
I'm calling my penis "the tour".
My tour's more satisfying.
His is all about him.
Mine's about you sometimes.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, thanks for inviting me tonight.
I-I didn't realize this was a singles party.
Oh.
No.
Uh, s-sorry.
Did Coach say that with a Sean Connery accent?
Did he say "shingles"?
'Cause he was He actually meant shingles.
Like the Like The Everybody here is a roofer.
Look, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.
I know that.
We both know that.
But this can't happen.
Are we attracted to each other?
Yes!
Do I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me?
I do.
But my job is to enforce the rules.
And I love my job, and I worked hard to get it.
So this cannot happen.
Is that why you locked me in your bedroom, and undone the top button of your dress?
I didn't undo the top Well, I did But that was an accident.
That wasn't for you.
It was for me.
I just need to know that you will respect the rules - and that this will go no further.
- I'll do my best.
Looks like you missed a few.
What?
Okay, I summoned everyone to the roof because Bangsgiving is in peril.
All of you are focusing on things that have nothing to do with getting laid.
Let us please not repeat the mistakes that we made at my Eight Nights of Hump-akah party.
Now, what is the freakin' problem?
Coach did the opposite of what I asked.
Come on, Jess, you guys would be great together.
It's a dumb rule, all right?
Dumb rule.
At least he turns you on.
Pepper makes my ding-dong and my ping-pongs go into my body.
Can somebody help me with this keg?
- Yeah, sure.
- Pepper's got it.
What if she doesn't know her own strength down there, and she mushes it, or, - Be a nightmare.
- like, rips it off and throws it across the room like a hot dog?
That's nothing.
Jess brought me a hot lunch lady.
What am I supposed to do with that?
Do sex with the lunch lady.
- Wait.
- That's obvious.
I have a real I know how it sounds.
I know how it sounds, - but she's a like, a real lunch lady.
- That's hot.
- A woman that's willing, ready and able - That's not an issue.
After she has sex with you, she can put food in your mouth.
That's not a problem at all.
I do have a real problem.
Schmidt is trying to sleep with a woman I've already slept with.
Well, at least he has a date, because mine never showed up.
Geoff is coming!
Apparently, a wild peacock got loose on the freeway, and is holding up traffic.
Now, you guys, we have guests downstairs.
And if we don't get back to them soon, they're gonna get spooked.
Um, so, have you always been from England?
I'm not going downstairs until Schmidt agrees to not sleep with Lucy.
Okay, yeah, sure.
Never!
According to the statute, if you two can't agree, we take it to a vote.
The winner gets the girl, the loser gets five grilled cheese sandwiches.
- I'll agree to that.
- Let's do it.
All right, all those in favor of Schmidt not sleeping with Lucy, raise your hand now.
- I don't care.
- Couldn't care less.
Raise 'em up.
Put 'em up.
Huzzah!
Warning: tonight things will get loud with Lucy.
But don't worry.
I'll have her jam a sock in my mouth right before I see angels.
- Okay, guys, what about me?
- Get your own sock.
No.
What am I gonna do about Ryan?
Just have sex with him.
Look, bang one out, get it out of your system.
- I don't do that.
- You should do that.
- You should bang one out.
- Yeah, makes the most sense.
- What?
!
- Nothing else has worked, okay, and the best way to get over a crush is just to do something about it.
- I don't know.
- Plus, he's British, so you know the sex will be weirdly polite.
Do you mind if I finish now?
He doesn't sound like Oliver Twist.
Do you like that?
Is that good, eh?
All right.
Here we go.
One really?
Two what?
Do you mind if I do it like that?
Hey, you like it when I do it like that, eh?
That was spot-on.
All those in favor of Jess doing Ryan, raise your hand.
Oh, he's trying to mess with me?
Here I go.
Cecilia.
No, you cannot have my beer.
You think I'm going after the beer.
- You okay?
- Mm.
Okay, great.
Happy Bangsgiving.
Close the door.
Oh, my God.
Is there nothing underneath that apron?
Just a little white meat looking for some gravy.
That probably wasn't very sexy.
I shouldn't have said that!
No, it was very becoming.
I'm totally confused about these oven mitts.
How else am I supposed to take a hot dish out of the oven?
These mitts were a bad idea.
What, uh, got you in the-the, uh, holiday, uh, sp-spirit?
Well, I like you, you like me.
Why don't we just bang one out of our system?
Bang one out of our system?
It sounds really bad.
I get that.
And I hear it now, it sounds awful.
But we just bang one out of our system, and then, we can go back to our strictly professional relationship, and I can stop thinking about you all the time, which I do.
I didn't come here to bang one out.
Well, you know what I mean.
- Look - I care about you.
- Well - Jess, I'm crazy about you.
Ryan, look.
Oh, God, it's so complicated.
Can I just put some pants on when we talk about this?
It is complicated.
This would have been worth it.
Oh, God.
Ryan.
Ryan!
Oh, God!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh, no!
Freaking Bangsgiving.
No, I actually put those in there myself.
I'll tell you, I wouldn't eat asparagus though.
It makes your pee smell.
Mmm.
Hey, Cece, I got that $20 I owe you.
It's, uh it's in my bedroom.
Okay.
Yeah, it's right this way.
You're really sexy for a Jew.
Not now, woman!
Wait.
What?
Who needs men?
You don't need a man.
- You can lift your own furniture.
- Hey, Pepper.
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
I am so sorry.
You approached my blind spot.
Your money is in her somewhere.
Let me just find it.
Great.
- Oh!
- What's the matter?
Did you hurt yourself?
No, it's just not there.
Let me Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ohh, that feels so good!
When I'm looking for your money, it feels so good.
I love that!
You nasty woman!
Cause you are making me give the money to you.
Oh, Cece, you love this!
- Getting your money.
- What exactly are you doing right now?
- Getting your money.
- You are definitely not getting my money, in no world you have my money.
I was flirting with you to give Schmidt a taste of his own medicine, okay, and it's a huge mistake and insulting to everyone involved, and I'm sorry.
Yeah, and also he would never fall for that, at all, okay - You are a dead man Miller!
- Don't, don't.
- I'll choke you to dead.
- I'll choke you to Barely fighting.
Schmidt, nothing was going on.
- He was just trying to make you jealous.
- Please, I know that!
He would never hit on you.
- You are on my Never List.
- I know she Whoa!
Whoa!
What are you doing?
You pissed me for bringing Lucy, and you bring Tran as a date?
Leave Tran out of this, he fought in Korea.
I don't know which side, but I know he is a war hero.
You couldn't find one of those drunk girls at the bar?
The ones with no family or friends.
That's your sweet spot, man.
- I know, I could have.
I didn't want to.
- Why not?
What kind of women have you been sleeping since you and Jess broke up?
- Terrible ones.
- And how does that make you feel?
Terrible.
- Then reaaly good.
- Expected, expected.
- There you go.
- And then immediately after terrible.
Just gonna put this out there, but I think you'd probably rather like to sleep with someone who doesn't make you feel terrible, but, you're just a little afraid of getting hurt again.
Nah, it didn't sound right.
You know, growing up we had this lunch lady named Miss Wheaton.
One day, I cut in line, so I can get actual tater tots.
And as punishment, she made me eat the entire tray.
In front of her.
While she's stared at me, for a long period of time.
And I'm not sure if you know how hard that is for a growing boy.
- How old were you?
- I was 18.
If it helps, we're called lunch monitor now.
No one says lunch lady anymore.
Kind of like how you can't call little people "shrinkies".
Oh, lunch monitor Pearl, I like you.
Excellent form.
You don't have a hard job.
So, I saw your butt earlier.
It's been holding up nicely.
It does the trick.
And I noticed, uh, Ryan left.
Yeah.
Ugh!
It's so embarrassing.
I kind of came onto him, and he told me he wanted more than just sex.
He wanted more than sex and that's a bad thing?
How?
Well, look, I'm his boss.
We could get sued, and I could get fired.
There's a reason it's against the rules.
You gotta br okay.
Remember when we tried to watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off?
Okay, I stick by that that kid is not a hero.
All he does is break rules.
What's so great about that?
You're taking Rooney's side.
No one takes Rooney's side.
I'm a vice principal Rooney is my people.
Ferris hijacks a parade.
That is an act of terror.
You want to know what I think, 'cause you're not going - to like it.
- What?
I don't think this is about breaking rules.
I think Ryan scares you.
You like him, and you're going to have to put yourself out there again, and that scares you.
But look, life moves really fast.
And if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you just might miss it.
Is that from Ferris Bueller?
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.
- It's a terrific movie.
- All right.
And I delivered it perfectly.
It was pretty good.
What are you doing here?
You're fired.
Just kidding.
Oh, God.
You left without eating so I thought, um I'd bring you a pie.
Well, most of a pie.
The guys ate some of it.
That's a lie.
I ate-I ate-I ate a piece on the way over.
I-I ate two pieces.
Three pieces.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Would you like to come inside?
No, um, I came here to say something and that this I want more, too.
This dish is empty.
Okay.
I ate the whole pie.
Look, I don't know what I'm doing or where this is going and I'm scared, but it's worth it 'cause it feels big.
And that's why I'm going to leave right now, and we're going to take it slow.
Wow.
Well, tonight is Bangsgiving, and I have to honor my American traditions.
It's my duty as an American I think I'm going to stop being afraid and start dating.
You probably knew all along, didn't you?
If only I could meet a girl like you, Tran.
Your face, your brain throw it in a dress.
Oh, daddy, I'd be with her forever.
I'm getting off topic.
Thanks for the talk.
I feel a lot better.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tran, are these all yours?
Come on, man.
I thought you were switching to white wine.
How do you think you're going to get home now?
You're not driving, so how are you going to get home?
Hey.
Are you Nick?
You the guy who's obsessed with my grandfather?
Grandpaps, you ready to go?
Hey.
Ah, ah, ha hey.
I'm taking off.
Um sorry I body-slammed you but this doesn't feel like it's working out so I don't really want to waste our time.
Look, Pepper, um I think you're beautiful, and very nice.
I just, uh You know, I'm not used to dating women that are stronger than me.
How do you know that I'm stronger than you?
Do you want to arm wrestle?
Yeah, like I'm that insecure that I have to prove my masculinity by arm wrestling a girl.
Come on.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three.
Yes!
That's how you do it!
That's how it's uh-uh-uh done!
Thank you for letting me win.
Sure.
Anytime.
Well, Lucy left.
Turns out she's a bit of an anti-Semite.
- Hmm.
- Yeah, looks like we both struck out.
Okay, Schmidt, there is no Geoff.
Come on.
But to honest, I'm kind of glad there isn't.
You know, Thanksgiving should be spent with the people that you care about.
Let me get you a beer.
By the way you're on my Never List, too.
Hi.
Are you Cece?
I'm Geoff.
Um, I'm Schmidt's friend.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I hit a peacock on my way here and then I held it in my arms until it died.
It was horrible, but also kind of uplifting.
Um, anyway, I brought creamed spinach.
Yeah!
There's my number.
Gr Tran!
Hey, would you hit that.
Maybe Yeah.
Ed Rooney.
Ed.
This is George Peterson.
How are you today, sir?
It's not him Rooney.
This movie should be called "The Day Rooney Trying To Do His Job".
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hey, hey, hey.
Here, scoot down, scoot down.
- Nick, what are you doing?
- What are you doing?
Sorry, just scoot down, I need to iron this shirt that I'm wearing for my date with Tran's granddaughter.
It's either this or the turtleneck my mother bought me in 2009.
They're my only clean shirts.
The short-sleeved turtleneck?
Don't do that.
Okay, look, we need this whole table for Nadia's baby shower, all right?
So, move along.
Nadia, isn't that the Russian chick who broke, uh, Schmidt's, uh Will to live?
After she broke my penis?
Who saw her and thought, "That's the woman I want to be the mother of my children"?
- She's not sure.
- Yeah, she calls it her little "sex party miracle".
Do you have to iron here?
It's the only flat surface!
Besides Winston's desk but he's using it to study for his police academy test, and he is "not to be disturbed".
Not enough, not enough.
There's an ironing board in the bathroom.
I know, but I've been using that to wedge it between two urinals to keep Schmidt from peeking.
- But fine, I'll use that!
- Coach!
Coach!
My Charlie Rose episodes, all 18 of them, are gone.
DVR is chockablock filled with American football matches, which, by the way, is a garbage Oh!
We cool?
- Yeah, we cool.
- Cool.
What the hell just happened?
- Fight.
- Yeah.
Now it's over.
I barely even remember it.
I cannot believe you guys handle things that way.
I'm starting to think that neither one of you read the Madeleine Albright biography I gave you for Christmas.
I'm so glad we don't fight.
- I know.
- Oh, please.
Women fight.
- Well, we occasionally get into a little thing.
- Yeah, I mean, like we just had that thing with the purse - but that was, like, barely even a thing.
- Yeah, that was nothing I mean, there's no point in even talking about it.
Oh.
No, you should have that.
- No, you should have it.
- No, you take it.
- No, you take it.
- No, you take it.
- I want you to take it.
- No.
Take it.
Look, I want you to have it 'cause it would look good on you.
- No, it's made for you.
You - No.
But then we both decided that it was better if neither one of us bought it.
- Yep.
- The neon yellow purse?
- With the strap?
- Yeah, I've seen that.
It's in your closet.
I wonder how many rubber duckies needed to die to make that thing.
Uh, Schmidt, you don't know what you're talking about.
I got to run.
- What?
- Thank you so much for helping with the baby shower.
- You know, you are just the best.
- No, you're the best.
- Whoa.
- Did I tell you I love your top, by the way?
- No.
Oh, I just found this in the back of my closet.
- What's what's happening?
You said too much.
- So, I'll call you later?
- Definitely.
- Okay.
Bye!
- Bye!
Oh, my God!
What just happened?
That's a girl fight.
Schmidt, stay out of it, man.
Girl fights are dangerous, okay?
I grew up with three sisters, and I wore a cup until I was 14 years old.
What's wrong?
They planned to wear braids and bows and didn't tell me on purpose.
There.
Now you match.
Well, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women.
You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.
- Schmidt - Let us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.
I grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.
You can't buy that kind of access.
Schmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.
- You don't want to get in the middle of that.
- Coach Jess has the purse.
I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.
- No, no, no - See?
Look the purse.
In the immortal words of Tag Team, "Whoop.
There it is".
Fine.
I went back and I bought the purse, 'cause I love it.
I love purses.
And that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist, either.
I'm a damn feminist who loves purses.
Where else am I supposed to keep my feminist writings?
In a purse, that's where.
Lena Dunham.
I don't know.
I Jess, it's a purse.
Who cares?
Just apologize.
Cece and I have been friends for 20 years.
Do you know why?
Because we're passive-aggressive people.
We never confront anything.
That's the way it works with us.
It always has.
Hi.
Hi.
And that was one of the worst fights we've ever had.
And if I bring up the purse, then everything else comes up with it.
Too many things have happened.
Women have amazing memories.
Because we used to be the gatherers, and so we had to remember where all the best berries were hidden.
And Cece and I, we've hidden berries all across the Great Plains.
Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska need I say more?
Coach gets it.
See, Cece and I, we're gonna be fine, 'cause it's gonna play out the way it always does.
We're not gonna talk for three days, and then I'll surprise her with a latte.
And then we'll act - like nothing happened.
- Three days without Cece?
Do I have to spend three days without Cece?
Yes.
I don't trust you around her.
She makes you weak and penis-dumb.
Three days without Cece?
Why don't you just replace my shoes with bags and turn me into a lunatic?
- Stay out of it, man.
- Stay the hell out of it, bro.
Here's a different take: Why don't I spend more time with her?
- Stay out of it.
- I'm confused.
Now, should I are you asking me to spend more time with her or stay out of it?
Like, for real?
I hate this.
I hate first dates.
Me, too.
I hate all I hate the second ones and the third ones - and the fourth ones.
- Me, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hate dates.
- Yeah.
- The first ones are the worst.
Yeah.
- This is terrible.
- They're terrible.
They're awkward.
- I feel like I'm being weird.
- You're not being weird.
- Yeah, I am.
- I'm the weirdo.
I wanted to do this all night.
That is so stupid.
- I hated that I did it.
- I feel like I'm being weird, too.
- How?
- I don't know how.
Just - Well, now you are.
- These sweaters.
I got sweater shoulder.
Now when you do that, it's very weird.
But before, it wasn't.
Just don't do sweater shoulder.
Please don't tell Tran how bad this is going.
- Oh, I will.
- Don't.
It'll be so embarrassing.
- Yeah.
- He's probably my best friend.
- Really?
- Yes.
You're not his best friend.
That's a terrible thing to say.
It's true.
- This is going great.
- Oh, God, I hate this.
I just want to sit around and do nothing, but that is not hot.
That's hot to me.
You add some sweatpants to that, and that is better than porn.
I love porn.
But I like to mute it and come up with my own voices, like, "Hey, that's a very interesting mesh cat suit".
"Thank you.
It used to be my grandmother's".
Something like that.
Cheers.
Yeah.
That was a weird cheers!
Can we go?
!
Yes.
Let's get out of here.
This sucks!
So cute.
Yeah, it's like they're made for each other.
- They haven't moved in three days.
- Very weird.
Alarming, even.
Wait, doesn't she work or ?
Shouldn't you be studying?
Or live somewhere?
Shouldn't you be studying?
- Or have worried loved ones?
- Studying?
Coach, this is gonna take some serious investigative police skills.
But I'm on to her.
I didn't know girls could be so slovenly.
I did.
I have sisters.
Oh, my God, we know.
We cool?
We cool.
Oh.
Just who I was looking for.
- Hey.
- How would you like a piping hot latte?
Thanks, Jess, but, you know, I, um I can buy my own.
What did you do?
Is this about the socks?
You weren't supposed to talk to Cece.
What happened?
Well, I had to see her.
I can't go three days without seeing Cece.
And it went just like you said it would.
I'm gonna go get the purse.
She played me like John Popper plays that little harmonica and fiddle thing.
Ugh.
She's like a robot scientist.
And you're like a damn robot.
And usually it's cute, except when you're robbing me.
Jess, I'm sorry.
So what what happens now?
You bring her another coffee and you guys make up?
I don't know what happens now.
We're in unchartered territory 'cause you got involved.
We're entering the abyss.
It's like the month I decided not to wear a bra.
Those were dark times.
I had no support.
Literally no support.
Cece just texted me - a smiley face.
- Is that bad?
No, she just texted me the world's first good smiley face.
I'm gonna text her a yellow heart.
No, uh, yellow heart, whale, thumbs up.
Well, that seems nice.
How dare she?
Chinese man, ballerina, apartment building?
- What does that mean?
- Fine.
Poop.
Turban guy.
Granny.
Don't text her poop.
Explosion, monkey-see?
You want to play dirty?
Fine.
Slice of cake.
Turtle.
Don't sen Double syringe?
Double syringe.
You're right, Schmidt.
Maybe it's time to dig up some berries.
The gatherers have become the hunters.
Be well.
Wh where are you where are going?
L leave those berries be.
- Republican or Democrat?
- West Wing.
What's your favorite thing about America?
- Kentucky women.
- Favorite part of The Rock?
- "Welcome to the Rock".
- Gorilla or monkey?
- Gorilla, hands down.
- Miranda or Carrie?
- Gorilla.
- That's 100% perfect.
- Unb unbelievable.
- Thank you.
The battery in the remote control is getting a little jumpy.
I'm gonna go grab one out of the smoke detector.
That's exactly where I get them.
Isn't she perfect?
No.
Nick, you might want to sit down for this.
- I'm already sitting.
- Okay.
Well, look I put together a profile.
Vague about where she lives.
- Okay.
- No mention of a job.
Always lets you pay.
Nick, my man, as unbelievable as this sounds you're her sugar daddy.
What kind of girl would want me as her sugar daddy?
a homeless woman.
- Kai is not homeless.
- Nick, I have been watching her for days now, okay?
She she eats like she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from.
She always dresses in layers, tons of layers.
She's not homeless.
Her grandfather is Tran.
- And where does he hang out?
- A park bench.
I think you're having a nervous breakdown.
I really do.
You're nuts.
You want to avoid studying so much that you're making up lies about my new lover friend.
Just leave us alone.
Maybe you should maybe you should give her our can opener.
Everybody gives bums cans, but they can't open them cans.
How are they gonna open the cans, Nick?
Hey What are you Do you want a blanket?
I must have fallen asleep reading.
- Nap with me.
- Okay.
Come on.
Just gonna get some of these newspapers.
- It's actually kind of nice.
- See?
More pink lemonade?
I'm going to name baby Baby, because it's funny.
Where is top of baby cage?
Double syringe?
Hey, you.
How's pee-pee?
Oh, hello, Nadia.
Coach, I need you.
Jess and Cece are in a thing, and it is terrifying.
I'm pretty busy, but, all right, hold on, let me put down the stuff I've been working on.
Coach, I am at the baby shower.
You're at the what?
Are you dumb?
You're dumb.
You're very dumb.
Get out of there.
I panicked.
I didn't know what else to do.
I thought I could fix this.
I gave Cece the purse.
Obviously, it was a mistake.
Oh, God, look at them.
They're like silent, angry statues right now it's terrifying and als Maybe a little erotic.
Okay, fine, it's very erotic.
You know what?
Coach, I'm telling you I'm finding out that fear plays a big part in my sexuality.
Schmidt, what happens when two passive-aggressive people start confronting each other?
- I don't know.
What happens?
- Anything!
Anything can happen.
That's what I'm telling you.
Are you ready for anything to happen?
Obviously not.
That's why I'm calling you.
Did you wash your hair?
It looks really clean.
I can help you end this.
Do you know why?
Do you know why?
I'm waiting.
- Oh, my God, is it because you have sisters?
- It's because I have sisters!
And you know what that means?
And that you know more about women than me.
I know more about women than you.
And that I'm a little dum-dum.
And I'm a big smart-smart.
Yeah.
Now, here's what you're gonna do.
Get big like a bear.
If that doesn't work, pee a circle around yourself and light it on fire.
I peed before I came I had a root beer with lunch.
I'm on my way.
Hey, uh, did you bring a gift?
'Cause I don't want to be that guy.
You know, the guy that doesn't bring a gift?
- Just get over here.
- All right, I'm coming.
What?
Coach.
Coach, I can't turn the pages.
How am I gonna study if I can't turn the pages?
Coach!
Hey.
Great catch.
Kai, I want to go to your place, okay?
Wherever it is.
So don't be afraid, because I'm not afraid.
I know I'm living this rock star life, but I'm still a man of the people.
But I'm so comfortable.
You really want to go outside, get off this bed into the cold right now?
Look, I like you for you, and Well, hell, I just hope, deep down, you like me for me and not all the incredible stuff that I have.
- Huh?
- I mean, this room half this stuff is mine.
I'm, like, I have enough pillowcases for all my pillows, plus an extra pillowcase that I don't even use.
Ticket stubs to all the Bears games I've ever been to, except for one.
The guitar pic from that guy who played with James Taylor that one night.
A Frisbee that I'm currently storing on my neighbor's roof.
You know, an autographed Karate Kid II poster from Mr. Miyagi.
- R.I.P. - Hmm.
But none of that matters.
I want to be with you wherever you live.
I mean, hell, I've been cooped up in this palace for long enough.
Wow.
Well, if it's that important.
All right.
Don't be nervous.
You know what?
I'm gonna bring some extra blankets.
Okay.
Okay, just in case it's freezing, 'cause it's outs Okay.
And then, you told Mike Hannamin I was on my period!
He wanted to know why you were wearing sweatpants in the pool!
Okay, I was defending you!
I have arrived!
Ah, Mr. Stripper.
Okay, so what's next, Jess?
They're getting into everything.
How I intentionally didn't put gas in your car - on senior ditch day?
- You did.
You did.
- I did not!
- All right, ladies, stop it.
I gave you the money, and you spent it on condoms and taffy.
By the way, that sounds like a hell of a day.
Well, I wouldn't know.
I was stranded on a beach being a virgin!
But that's not the only time I've been stranded, now, is it?
- I'm talking about Paris.
- Oh, this is about Paris!
- I'm talking about Paris.
- I knew it!
We had signed a lease.
That's an agreement.
And then you decide to take a modeling job in Paris, so I had to move in with Spencer?
While you were being squired about the Louvre, I was having to pee on top of Spencer's pee to conserve water!
You know, it's called mud-sharking, by the way.
- It's not my fault!
- Stop it!
I'm bored.
Here's what you guys are gonna do.
You're gonna punch each other.
Now I'm not bored.
- I'm not doing that.
- What?
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, you got to do something.
Man up, punch each other and end this.
You gotta have it out so you can get past this.
Now I'm bored again.
- Punch each other!
- Now I'm not bored.
Talk with your fist!
I just want my - Oh, no!
- My goodness!
Back off!
La ladies?
It's spreading.
Stop it!
Russian baby shower.
- Hey, hey, don't involve us, please.
- Whoa.
Hey, guys, no!
Break it up!
Break it up!
Baby shower!
Baby shower, yeah!
Baby shower!
Oh, stop it!
You stole my babysitter!
What are you doing?
I'm having a situation.
Oh, come on, dude.
- Get off!
- Fighting for no damn reason with me?
!
Come on, just lie down and take it like a woman!
This is for Mike Hannamin.
Baby kick.
Baby like.
Yay!
Do I look pretty?
Do you feel, like, really good right now?
Yes!
I thought I was crazy.
No, you're not crazy.
I think I I think I wanted to punch you for a really long time.
Felt that way.
Like maybe ten or 15 years.
And it feels so good that right now we don't have to talk everything through.
Yeah.
We can just punch it out.
Oh, my God, I have missed you.
I can't believe I've known you 20 years.
And you're still my favorite person to talk to.
And you're my favorite person to talk to.
I hate not talking to you.
I feel like I've missed everything!
You did miss everything.
So, does Nick have a girlfriend?
- Yes.
So weird.
- You okay?
Yes.
So weird.
So, is Nadia going to raise the baby in your apartment?
Yeah, we haven't really talked about that yet.
You should.
Craig Hodges.
Hello.
Nick.
Nick, are you okay?
- Winston?
- Listen, listen, listen, Nick.
- Winston.
- Tell me everything.
Winston, she's rich!
Yeah, she founded some company that sells fancy water bottles to rich people to pay for digging wells in Africa.
She sold the company, so now she works whenever she wants.
It's a scam called consulting.
You see, I knew it.
I knew there was something weird.
I was right!
You were wrong about literally everything.
But I knew there was gonna be a twist, though.
Okay, do you realize how much time you've wasted, and you're not studying?
Sweet Baby LeBron James, I screwed up.
Hey, I should probably get going.
I got to get to work.
Yeah, it's karaoke night, so I got to get there early enough to break the karaoke machine.
How much will you make tonight?
Ah, it depends how much I drink, but probably about 140 bucks.
What is this?
I raise you to $200.
Now you can stay.
Deal.
I'm like a boy hooker.
Thank you.
Are you crying?
Don't look at me.
I want to look pretty.
You paid for it.
Nadia is the one who broke my thing.
Wait, you were serious about that?
Yes.
That was her.
I'm telling you.
She's going to have to childproof the corners of her cha-cha before that baby comes out.
Oh, Cecilia.
Thank goodness.
Look at you.
You're still pretty.
And, Jess, you know, you you look the same.
I'm sorry about making you guys - punch each other.
- Don't be sorry.
- You're so right.
- Mm.
We've wasted so much time being passive-aggressive.
- We learned our lesson.
- Yeah.
- Well, we're very smart.
- That means a lot.
Thank you.
Seriously, if you guys fought like girls, you'd still be arguing over the fact that you recorded football over your Charlie Rose episodes.
It's all good, man.
Yeah, well, it's nothing.
Mm-hmm, and the girl Schmidt would be like, "Oh, does Coach just think I'm a pretentious poseur who just records things to look smart because deep down, I am just terrifyingly insecure about my intelligence"?
Yeah, and girl Coach would be, like, "Does Schmidt think that I'm an uncultured meathead who has to rewatch football because I'm afraid of showing anyone my softer side"?
Hey, man.
- Oh, hey, Coach.
- Aw, hey, you.
- That's nice.
- Oh, this?
I I don't know.
Thanks, I guess.
- I'm kind of whatever about it.
- No.
What do you got there?
Oh, me?
Uh, just some sneakers.
I hope they're okay.
I don't have an eye for things like you.
Well, yeah, you do.
Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
- Your eye is so good.
- I'm sure they're great.
- I - Not that you could look bad in anything really.
Son of a Thank you for that.
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- Anytime.
- We cool?
- Yeah, we cool.
Ooh, boy.
How many pages are in this thing?
Darius Miles.
Oh!
That's in there?
Jordan!
Massaging is illegal?
What?
Gotta download a song.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Gingy, who did you harm?
Gingy, who ate your arm?
It was Santa!
No!
This is pretty dark.
We will rescue you, Gingy!
Wait till they get to the North Pole to avenge his death and take it way too far.
Santa's been a bad boy, and that's not right The white-bearded devil's gonna die tonight!
But I'm proud of that.
They worked really hard on it.
Do you want to visit the prop closet?
Okay, just two more hours, and then it's ten days down a wine bottle.
Oh, my gosh.
All this sneaking around, I feel like gay guys in the '50s.
I can't believe you're going to London tonight.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
- Come with me.
- What?
Spend Christmas with my family in London.
That's, like, skipping seven relationship steps.
- What do you mean?
- Do you really want your whole family to meet the weird American girl that you're making out with in a prop closet who's also your boss?
- Yeah.
- Everything's been going really, really well.
What if I use the wrong fork?
You won't use the wrong fork, 'cause I'll make sure that you-you don't.
No, it'll be very casual.
And I don't care what they think, 'cause I like you, and I want to spend Christmas with you in London.
I've never been to Europe.
I We'll stroll through Hyde Park, empty townhouses owned by Russian billionaires.
We're gonna go to Big Ben.
I'll take on-on the wheel, the Eye.
We'll eat cheese on the wheel and-and make out.
Uh, we're gonna ride black taxicabs even to places where we don't need to go and we're not invited.
- Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
- Yes!
Okay, Alan.
You did your best.
Why did I agree to ride to the airport with everyone?
I'm an aspiring millionaire.
I should be taking a Town Car, not packed six-deep like a Hasidic family going to the bulk foods store.
Relax, Schmidt, we're all riding together so that we can hang out before we all go to our magical destinations.
Magical?
I'm going back home to Long Island, the birthplace of the female crew cut.
Yeah, and I'm going all the way to New York because my mom wants to hand-deliver a Christmas card to Matt Lauer, but you, Jess, you're going To London!
'Ello, guvnor.
You got to stop it with that accent.
- Fancy a tickle?
- Borderline racist.
Check it out.
I'm coming in hot with gifts for the family.
- I'm ready for anything.
- Is that a wallet necklace?
Yeah, so I don't get pickpocketed.
Smart.
Keep that money away from them Gypsies.
Are you nervous about meeting his family?
No, no.
Yes.
All right, here's the plan.
We're at O'Hare at 8:00, O'Leary's at 9:00, we're drunk by 6:00.
See what I did there?
We're drinking on the plane.
Man, I love Christmas Eve Eve at O'Leary's.
I always get laid.
See, here, I'm a six, sixish.
Uh, but I'm a Chicago ten.
Yeah.
I'm a six, man?
Maybe a little higher.
- Seven.
- But I'm I'm a seven, thank you.
Plus Nick is dating Kai now, which means I'm getting the butt.
I'm getting all the butt.
I made you guys some snack bags.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh.
You're like my mom, but in ways I can appreciate.
Hey, Coach, what's taking you so long?
There he is.
I know what you're all thinking.
You think I'm selfish for going on vacation instead of going to Detroit to see my family.
Not thinking that; very defensive.
I live with a million people.
Four people.
There are going to be a million people at my mother's house.
I need some me time.
And yes, I will be sad to miss my baby niece and all of her Christmas joy, but I've made a decision that I'm happy with, and it hasn't been giving me stomach pains.
- You seem really great.
- Yeah.
- I feel good.
- Can we please go?
!
- Yeah!
- Let's go to the airport!
Christmas!
- I'm getting in.
- No, no, no, no.
- Too late.
- Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Loving the new Ford Fusion!
- You don't stink at all, man.
- Nice.
- Are you wet?
- Just my bottom.
Check out how roomy this is.
You could open a hat store in here.
- Why would I do that?
- That tree's cool.
- What's it doing?
- It coaches you to drive more efficiently.
Oh, look at that.
Your name is Coach.
That's fun.
I don't know why that's fun to me, but it is.
Pretty funny, I Hey, Outside Dave, will you take a holiday picture?
Well, I'd prefer to paint you, but it appears time is pressed against us.
All right.
Let me get a good filter.
Okay, now pretend you're really thirsty, but the only thing that can quench your thirst is the tears from a golden retriever.
Go.
Oh, that's good.
Aaaaaand.
got it.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
Excuse me, what's going on?
Midwest storm.
Everything's delayed.
God have mercy on us all.
Ow!
Ow!
Move, white bitch!
Ryan, hi.
My flight's delayed.
Please tell your parents this is not like me.
I am never late.
On time or naked is what I always say.
I've never said that.
I'll be fully clothed, but late.
I'll talk to you later.
Okay, I got this.
Coach, your flight's okay.
Thanks, Jess.
I'm going to go find a charging station so I can, uh, call my niece before Hawaii.
Everyone stop looking at me!
Cece and Schmidt, you're on the red-eye.
The red-eye?
What do I look like, a 24-year-old who's too afraid to break up with his college girlfriend?
I mean, thank you for this.
Nick and Winston, I got you guys.
Next.
Hi.
Hi.
First and foremost, I'd like to wish you a very merry Christmas.
Next.
Uh, right.
Um, my friends are trying to get on the Chicago flight.
Uh, Winston Bishop and Nick Miller.
Yeah, standby, tenth and 11th on the list.
I really appreciate that, but is there any way you could get Nope.
And now they're 12th and 13th.
I'm sorry.
I was Don't apologize.
14, 15.
I didn't apologize.
Sir.
You seem like a reasonable person.
I'm not and you're at 18 and 19.
Okay You know what?
You want mean, I'll give you mean.
I hope your mom falls down the stairs and she hurts parts of herself.
I hate my mom.
Back to 16 and 17.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
18, 19.
It's Christmas.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I thought they just did a black version of Annie for no reason.
- You - 22, 23.
- But - 24, 25.
- Sir.
- They're on the wing, dear.
Next?
- No.
- Next?
Stop pushing.
Flight 202 to Dallas - Fort Worth cancelled.
Hey, let's wait in the first-class lounge, like the other HBO GO subscribers.
- You're a member?
- Cece, I grew up on the mean streets of Long Island, just gazing up at the Manhattan city skyline, thinking, "You know what, one day, I'm gonna get there".
That first-class lounge is my Manhattan.
"Greatest discovery of all time "is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude".
Oprah Winfrey.
Sir, may I help you?
Are you a member?
I just had an incredible layover.
Flew in from Istanbul.
I just need to lay down for a while.
- I'm a little - Okay?
Certainly.
Uh, do you have a first-class ticket or a membership card?
Do I have a a membership card?
Let me ask you something.
I tend to, uh tend to deal with, uh, - Sarah Beth.
- I'm not aware of a Sarah Beth, sir.
The last time I talked to her, she was suffering from the diabetes.
Is she still on the inhaler?
- Uh - Did she pass?
She passed, didn't she?
- I'm afraid I - I'm gonna need a minute.
I'm just gonna go inside, sit down, just kind of take - Are you a member, sir?
- Am I a mem?
Can we just get two guest passes, please?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
That's a real thing guest passes?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
It's a debit card.
Is Ro-Ro done yet?
Damn.
Okay, uh, have her call me, but m-my phone's about to d My ph Hello?
Damn it.
Really?
Phone and a laptop?
You're playing solitaire?
Is that a keyboard?
Dude, come on!
Why we should've taken trains.
The sky's too fickle.
It's the play place for butterflies.
"Can't wait to see you.
House at the end of the lane"?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- What?
This is where Ryan lives.
- Whoa!
- What?
It's a gorgeous mansion.
He said it was casual.
Does "casual" mean something very different in England?
Like like "we own England"?
That's some McDuck money!
That's "do whatever I want" money.
- Exactly.
- You better learn how to ride a polo horse.
It's actually a polio horse.
Uh, originally they were bred as helper horses for people with polio, but I don't think anything of what I just said was correct, so What is?
Are you all right?
Hey.
My flight's delayed.
Might not even meet his very rich family.
Anyway, you guys should go to your-your gate.
Get out of here, you Christmas packages.
- All right.
Merry Christmas.
- All right, let's Yeah.
- Okay.
Yeah.
- All of that good stuff.
- See you later.
- Safe travels.
Is that a falcon wearing a necklace?
- Can I help you?
- Sir I'd like the strongest drink you have, and also a wine spritzer on the side in case I don't like it.
Thank you.
Looks like somebody's not so merry.
Come on.
Are you?
Okay, um that's silly.
I really want this to be true.
What seems to be troubling you?
I just found out that my boyfriend is is really rich, and there's no way his parents are gonna like me, and he's Well, have you ever thought that the world is just full of sloths, and then one day, this beautiful lion walks in?
Actually, you've probably never thought that way, Santa.
Can I just go ahead and call you Santa?
Anyway, should I just bail on this trip?
Hmm, sounds complicated.
Yeah.
Why don't you come with me to the family bathroom, sit on my lap, and I'll give you the sleigh ride you'll never forget?
What?
Santa!
North Pole.
Player for life.
Get out of here!
Pervert Santa!
No cookies for you here, you white-bearded freak!
Well, well, well.
If it isn't ol' Bangs LaRue.
Don't test me, sweetie.
I'll put your head in a trash can.
Wow.
You and I are gonna drink.
Wow, this place is just so amazing.
You got to feel this pillow.
Look at this thing.
This is the pillow that all the other pillows want to have sex with.
Nice.
Look at that guy.
Bet he's the kind of guy who takes one bite of lobster and just throws the rest of it in the trash.
I'd love to do that just once.
Stupid trash lobster.
He's coming over.
Hello, sir.
First time in the lounge?
Uh What's that, now?
Come on.
Why would you say that?
Because of all the pillow squeezing.
I get it.
I get it.
I was like you once.
Where are you from?
I'm from New York.
Uh, Manhattan, of course.
Mainly the money and museum district.
I can see the Central Park horses defecating from my window.
That's funny.
So can I. - Robert Goodwin.
- All right.
- Schmidt.
- Mind if I sit?
Please, go ahead.
Due to increased security, please have your picture ID ready.
All right, here's what we got to do.
We got to convince a bunch of people not to fly, and then we're at the top of the list.
It's foolproof unless it doesn't work.
Then it didn't work, so I think we got a 50-50 chance to do it, so let's do it.
Wait.
Ah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.
- Yeah.
What's up, boys?
Those are the guys I was just drinking with at the bar.
Are you sure you guys can fly a plane?
I'm sure it's not a big deal.
I bet the weed will offset the booze.
Ah, hey there, precious.
Yeah, you're quiet now, but when that air pressure hits you, you're gonna be screaming like a cat in the dishwasher.
And I won't stop you.
This could be it, so if we all die on this plane, was it worth it?
I say yeah, let's get to Chicago.
Who cares?
It's snowing there.
You gonna bite me?
When we get on the plane, I'm gonna bite you back.
Breast-feeding is a very sensitive subject for me.
I can help who's next.
Sir?
- Uh, sir, he doesn't work here.
- Oh, yes, I do.
- Uh, no, you - Oh, I'm sorry.
Your flight's been canceled.
The flight has not been canceled.
- Flight's been canceled.
- Security!
Security!
Please get this woman out of here!
- Please get this man - She's wearing a fake outfit.
You know what?
I don't know Debbie, don't start with me.
You're in a mood.
And then he sent me this text.
Oh, my God.
Where's Anna and Mr. Bates?
- Do you watch Downton?
- Yeah.
I know it's a soap opera, but I like it.
It's not even about the money.
- That's big.
- It's like every new piece of information I get about him just makes him more and more out of my league.
- Mm.
- He'll be nice about it, but the moment I get there, everybody will know I don't belong there.
- Am I being dumb?
- No.
Did I ever tell you about that time I met my ex-boyfriend's family over the holidays?
I've known you for 20 minutes.
Well, it was worse than the last season of Scrubs.
A teaching hospital?
Come on!
People think Christmas is gonna be like Love Actually and "God Only Knows" is gonna play over their happy ending, but it won't.
Do what I do.
Hide out with a pizza and save the big issues for the New Year.
- Oh, God.
- Don't judge me for eating pizza!
No.
My presents are gone.
- What?
- Santa stole my presents.
He was a Reverse Santa.
"Reverse Santa"?
What am I gonna do now?
You can't go now.
You're right.
I can't.
God, I'm drunk at work.
- Sis?
- Hello.
Hey.
Let me talk to Ro-Ro.
Hmm-mm.
I'm not trying to make you feel better about lying naked on the beach sipping some nonsense instead of seeing your family.
And are you using the cuteness of your daughter to blackmail me to come to Christmas?
Am I?
Yeah, I am, actually.
Ro-Ro, it's your Uncle Ernie!
If you can hear me, get your mom's hair wet, then get on the phone while she's freaking out!
You want to speak to your niece, you know where she is.
Diversification.
That's what it's all about.
You know, I keep telling Nick that, but he won't listen to me.
Hey, man to man.
Anything.
What?
I'd love to take a run at your girl.
Excuse me?
Now, don't tell me you're exclusive.
Successful men like us, we don't order just one item off the menu.
I'll tell you what.
You do this for me, and I'll do this for you.
Gold Select.
Gets you into any airport club in the world minus New Zealand.
What's going on guys?
Closing some deals?
Well, actually No we are not.
You know what they call you where I'm from?
A dirty old bitch.
Dirty old "biatch".
"Biatch," just in general.
'Cause I ain't from Manhattan, sir.
I'm from Long Island.
You better calm down, or you're gonna be kicked out of the Good, I don't want to be in this lounge, I don't want to be in any club that you're a part of.
Okay, am I missing something?
I don't want to be in any lounge or club that you're a part of, sir.
You dirty old bitch, for good measure.
'Cause I'm from Long Island, I'll take the railroad LIRR.
You're embarrassing yourself.
New York, Long Island.
Billy Joel.
Cece, let's roll.
Okay.
Nassau County.
Billy Joel, one more time.
"Piano Man".
"Goodnight Saigon".
That's a sad one.
Cry about that, you dirty old bitch.
So they go to this bar in Chicago to get Winston laid - And one of these guys is your ex?
- Yeah, Nick.
Mm, the nicest thing I ever did for an ex is give him a ride to the airport.
And for me, that's just going to work, and I still barely did it.
Okay, please don't take this as a Christmas miracle.
But what can I do to help?
Do you want to fly first-class somewhere, like Pittsburgh?
And then tell everyone you're a Latin pop star?
I did that once, and it's kind of the perfect Christmas.
You can pass as Latin.
Actually, you know what I'd love?
Hope first class is okay.
And don't freak out, but I think Paul Dano's on your flight.
And don't thank me, thank her.
But thank me also, because I'm the one that did it.
Wow, this is really amazing.
Thank you, guys.
Don't thank us, go.
Call me if you want to hang out this week.
I was thinking about going to the mountains and crying at some point, but that's flexible.
All right, I got to bounce before these people I bumped come after me.
Don't worry, they deserve it.
I'm being bumped?
You're an idiot, I'm Gold Select.
Check it out.
Come on, just tell me what he said.
Without going into specifics, he disrespected something more important to me than any stupid lounge.
Daniel Craig's tailoring?
No.
Something priceless.
- Hey.
- What?
I stole you something.
Bam!
You sneaky Indian mouse.
I'm in my own lounge now.
Look, I know this is kind of dumb to say, but I really like being your friend.
My friend.
I like being your friend, too.
Yeah.
Merry Christmas, Schmidt.
Merry Christmas, Cecilia.
Is it crazy that I'm considering going to Detroit instead of Hawaii?
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, I thought that.
Ooh, this is a fancy seat.
Reminds me of the seat my grandmother used to ride up and down the stairs in.
- Hey, Jess.
- Damn thing was comfortable.
Thank you, first class is amazing.
Smells like rich people.
I'm so glad.
- These are nice.
- Hey, where are you?
Did you board?
Um, yeah, I'm on the plane, I'm sitting in my seat.
Welcome to Los Angeles International Airport.
Wait, w Jess, what was that?
Uh, they're telling me to turn off my phone.
Uh, we're taking off now.
Jess, hold on, hold on, hold on, J How do you change this?
How do you change this thing?
!
To the hits?
I don't know, like top 40?
Jess, what's going on?
I'm not going.
Are you kidding me?
You saw the house.
It's too much pressure.
- Je - And Santa stole my gifts.
Wait, Santa did what?
What if I do something wrong and and I lose Ryan?
So, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna spend Christmas alone?
- Sir?
We're about to take off.
- Yeah.
- We need you to turn off your phone.
- I understand.
I just need one minute.
It's gonna be fine, don't worry.
- I mean, it's cra - Sir?
- Now, sir.
- I'm trying to figure something out.
- If she's not getting on a plane.
- Hey, Nick!
This is first class!
Act like you've been somewhere before!
Merry Christmas, Nick.
- Jess, hey!
- Sir.
Jess.
You're not spending Christmas alone.
Oh, no.
You're going to England.
What are you guys doing?
Hey, you think you're gonna lose Ryan 'cause you're not good enough for his stupid family?
Has he ever had five people get off planes for him?
I-I hadn't gotten on mine, yet.
T-To be fair, we were in the food court, - but it's beautiful, keep going, Nick.
- Look, Jess, we're not getting on our flights unless you get on yours.
Airport chicken, that's right.
You want to take down everyone's Christmases?
Don't be that person.
You got to go to England, and you have to just try.
Go to England, Jess, it's worth it.
But my flight's boarding, and I don't have any gifts, and there's no way I'm gonna make it.
Oh, no, you are gonna make it, come on.
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go!
This doesn't seem great.
Okay, you know what, let's go, let's go.
Let's just, let's just run.
Come on, let's go.
Let's go.
So, I guess this is good-bye.
I don't care if there's no time.
I love you guys.
Ah, come on.
Get out of here!
Love doesn't matter!
Merry Christmas.
Bye.
Give me a little space.
Ugh!
Light a match.
Cece, watch.
Oh, my God.
Got him.
Hi, Ro-Ro.
Uncle Ernie!
Hey, I'm here.
Are you here?
I'm here.
I got your text, and I came here to surprise you.
I'm outside your loft.
Where are you?
Oh, no!
No!
I'm in London.
Stay where you are, I'll be there in 17 hours.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
How do I look?
What do you guys think?
Not bad, Winston.
I'll tell you what, man you look like the funny guy from Police Academy who does the the voices, and different sounds.
God, I wish marketers had a uniform.
To Winston Bishop, owner of cats, taker of baths, graduate of the LAPD.
We are so I'm so proud of you!
- What?
- I'm so proud of you.
- You're proud of me?
- Oh!
When is this night construction gonna stop?
I actually don't mind it.
Gets me ready for all the loud action on the job, you know what I mean?
Something has gotta change.
Well, don't worry, 'cause I have called the city's automated help desk and I've also sent out an e-mail to information@losangeles.gov, so action has been taken.
Jess, don't you know how democracy works?
We need to get out there and grease palms, blackmail people.
We need to send them an envelope filled with fake blood and and a note that says "I know".
What?
- As if as if we know what's really going on.
- Schmidt, you do realize you're saying this in front of a police officer.
- I'm so sorry.
- A little respect.
Can I try on your uniform?
No, this uniform is for official police business.
Yeah.
- Looking good, man.
- Yeah.
We got a code Jewish, code Jewish.
You under "ch'arrest".
I can't believe Winston's gonna be a cop.
I mean, he's the gentlest person I know.
He once broke his arm wrapping presents.
Remember when he made this?
He's the sweetest guy in the world, man.
He's just so nice and - vulnerable.
- Yeah.
Although Don't know what this is for.
Hey.
What're you guys doing?
Uh, n nothing, man.
Look, I'm a little worried about you, okay?
And so is Coach.
Kind of worried about you, man.
Guys, calm down.
I understand, I get it, and I'm and I'm flattered that you're concerned about me, but I signed up for this, remember?
Also, my training officer is gonna be with me the entire time.
He's got a partner.
- I forgot about the partner.
- That's huge.
- We're silly.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
It's supposed to be a real bad-ass, too.
Was in a biker gang for three years, undercover.
Can't go back to Arizona no more.
- Is that True Detective?
- Apparently eats bullets as a party trick.
- Great, that's really good.
- That makes sense, what are you, uh - Yeah, yeah, definitely.
- What's that?
What the ?
Which Oh, that?
It's a, uh it's a project.
I've had a report of people acting lame back here.
Ow, Jess!
Also, I tazed Schmidt.
All right, seriously no more playing with the uniform.
Officer Leslie Biggins.
Okay, Biggins, so Bishop's gonna be next, okay?
Come on.
All right, here we go.
Officer Hank Bishop.
Eh Oh, that one.
Officer Win field Bishop.
Well that's gonna cause a lot of mix-ups over at the station.
Officer Winston Bishop.
- Winston - Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston, Winston, - Winston, Winston !
- Yes.
Winnie!
Sorry.
Wow, a lot of city officials around here.
Maybe somebody can help us with our noise problem.
Okay, enough of this by-the-book nonsense.
It's time to play hardball.
- Be a shark, Jess.
Not a dolphin.
- Right.
So I shouldn't be the smartest and friendliest creature in the ocean?
That makes sense, bro.
Sharks eat whatever they want.
Dolphins they jump through hoops, so, yeah, I think it does make sense.
No, it's awesome, bro.
Okay, stop mockingly saying "bro".
My uncle was arrested for having sex with a dolphin.
- What?
- What?
Carry on.
I'm having a lot of difficulty nailing you down, Ryan.
Oh, there's councilwoman Fawn Moscato.
She's from our district.
Yummo.
- Where do I place my ballot?
- She better get ready, 'cause she's about to have a very friendly conversation with a concerned citizen bro.
Okay, Jess, it's not gonna do anything.
Won't make a difference.
Like what I did there with the ballot thing?
It was a good joke, right?
Didn't get the reaction I thought - it was gonna get from you guys.
- No, we got it.
- We got it, bro.
- Oh, I get it.
And you know what, I've seen the Bollywood movies, I've seen the UK Office.
Not a fan, not a fan.
Congratulations.
These are from all of us, but I'm the one that got 'em for you.
- Wow, they're big.
- So, Winnie, where's your bad-ass training officer?
Oh, guys, I would like for you to meet the person who will be training me as I brave the mean streets of L.A.: Officer Aly Nelson.
She's so small.
- What say - Excuse me?
You're so small, you're - What is happening?
- I think what he was - trying to say was that, um - Yeah?
we were expecting someone who looks a little more like a cop in the traditional sense.
- That's what I meant.
- No, no, no - Wow.
No, no, no.
- I'm not trying to offend you, we were just expecting, like, uh, either a really strong man or kind of like a guy with, like, a mustache.
Got it.
And flowers are a that's a normal thing to give to a grown man?
Or are they trees?
I can't tell, I'm so small.
- Cool friends, Bishop.
- No, wait, Officer Nelson, just Thank you.
Thank you very much, you guys.
Oh, also, thank you for the flowers.
And just we're clear the first thank you was sarcastic, because you embarrassed me, but the second thank you was sincere as hell, because these flowers are glorious.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry about the construction noise it's an issue close to my heart I do charity work with deaf children.
Of course, they would welcome the noise, because it would mean they could hear.
Let me let you in on a little secret.
Just go to the public works web site and download this form.
You're a dear, Fawn.
I made a pun and I didn't know it.
You're too much.
- Oh.
- Hi.
Schmidt, this is Fawn Moscato.
She was just giving me a shortcut to file some complaints about the noise.
Looks like someone brought a shark to the dolphin show.
That's a dolphin noise.
Ah.
Very good.
Councilwoman Moscato, excuse my trembling, but it's an honor.
- Your head is enormous.
- Why, thank you.
So you're taking her out to dinner?
That's your plan?
I'm intoxicating a single, overworked public official with the pleasure of my company.
Which I will then parlay into getting her to fix our problem.
Are my sleeves even?
This is ridiculous.
You know, my new tailor sews like an army medic.
I'm not being overdramatic when I say that I would rather sit naked on a hot grill than wear something off the rack.
Schmidt, just don't screw this up.
She's a decent woman.
Oh, excuse me, at some point in the evening, can you let me know that I have a call from Karl Lagerfeld?
Schmidt.
Bob, how are you?
Tony, love you in a chino.
Guillermo, fire up that grill, Fawn's hungry.
Sí, señora.
I'm Fawn Moscato.
And I approve this scotch.
Oh, goodness.
Okay, so I'm almost finished with form 7D42, but I'm not sure what to put down for landlord's birth city.
Hey.
Ooh.
What you doing, hot shot?
I was feeling saucy.
I've had a glass of red wine.
Red wine makes you bonkers horny.
I'll make you a deal.
When I finish a form, you can take off an article of clothing, and that way, when I'm done, then we can just go nuts on each other.
- Deal.
- Hey, I'm not finished yet.
Oh!
- This is America!
Wear pants!
- Red wine.
Sorry!
- Sorry.
Sorry.
Very sorry.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
Geez.
Yeah.
So, tomorrow's your first shift, huh?
You gonna play the name game, do something fun and safe like that?
Dude, I'm gonna be in a patrol car the entire time.
I just got a text from my buddy Reynolds.
Working his first shift, he got stabbed in the leg by a little girl.
I love Reynolds, man.
He makes me laugh.
- That's funny - You think that's funny?
- To be stabbed by a little kid, yeah.
- On the job.
- Right.
'Cause you get paid.
- That you're about to do.
Right, 'cause it's a child, and it's hilarious.
You don't like getting cut.
You're very physically sensitive.
I am.
Paper cuts give me headaches.
- I can't wait to meet him.
- Yeah.
- Maybe he'll stab me.
- Guys, chill out, okay?
I told you, I got my partner - to protect me, remember?
- The little one?
The one would could take a nap in a match box?
Which reminds me I'm gonna make her a sandwich tomorrow.
I might even throw in a crossword puzzle with Winston-related clues so she can get to know me better.
"Who likes cats"?
Winston, across.
I don't like this.
- His training officer can't protect him!
- She's too tiny.
She looks like she won the silver medal in Athens for the balance beam.
Girl could drown in a raindrop.
I mean, that's girl's I mean, she I can't think of one 'cause I'm so worried about Winston!
I'm worried about him, too, but I can still think of 'em.
Uh, girl's so, uh Ugh!
She looks like a Persian Webster.
Ah Girl's like a pepperoni.
- Why are you here?
- We brought you a gift.
Assorted candies.
Please enjoy.
They are delicious.
Now, I'm sure you have friends and family of officers coming in here all the time to check on them.
No.
No, this would be a first.
- Really?
This is the first?
- What do you guys need?
Well, we are here because, uh, Winston is our best friend, as you know, and, um - we're worried about him.
- Yeah.
And I'm not saying that you're bad at your job as a training officer.
But I'm not saying you're good at your job.
And that's why we're here to kind of see where you're at, to see if you're ready to protect our asset, our dear friend.
Let's let's be diplomatic.
Did Bishop put you up to this?
Does he have some sort - of problem with me being his training officer?
- Not at all.
No.
Oh, he is going to pay for this.
He is going to pay.
- He shouldn't pay for this.
- This has nothing to do with it.
- This is about us.
- Okay.
First of all, you shouldn't get mad at him.
Get mad at us.
- Get out!
- It's good to see you.
- Get out.
- Okay.
Yo.
Ry-guy.
I finished printing out the forms.
- Let's get goofy.
- Mm.
Come on!
You got a real Dudley Moore thing going on right now, and I like it.
Jessica Day, I think I'm in love.
- Sorry.
Did you just say you were in love?
- That woman is a dynamo.
So let's talk about the whole construction noise thing.
Has anyone ever told you you look like a Jewish Kennedy?
I hope not, because that would be offensive.
What?
I thought you were supposed to be some kind of big shark, and you were playing her.
About the noise.
Given the many considerations traffic, budgets Okay, what is happening?
What are you doing with your thumb?
We feel it best to proceed with the given strategy.
She played you!
I know, and it was wildly arousing!
But let me tell you something, Jess.
She played you, too.
No, she didn't.
No, she didn't.
I filled out the form, I submitted it.
Here's the confirmation, right here.
"Thank you for your inquiry.
- We will respond in 360-500 days "!
- Isn't she great?
She can't just walk all over the people of the city like the Jolly Green Giant.
Jolly Green Giant He doesn't stomp on people.
He encourages them to eat their vegetables.
You can't let her do this!
We have to keep fighting!
She's taking me to a ribbon-cutting ceremony at a carniceria tomorrow.
You know, Jess, I really think that she may be grooming me to be her arm candy.
This could be a real Bill and Hillary situation.
You, sir, are no Bill Clinton.
I know.
I'm Hillary.
Well, you're not Hillary, either!
I am, too, Hillary!
Hey, man, can you be the one to walk away?
'Cause I just, like My little sleeping British bulldog here is gonna wake up, and he's gonna get scared if I'm not there.
- Yeah, I got you.
- Yeah.
A bunch of neighbors have joined the fight.
See, if you put out an honest message, you get good, honest people to help you.
Per municipal code 2B, construction is prohibited at night.
However, this project's been issued a waiver that we are trying to revoke.
Now, I'm going to mash a muffin into the phone.
You tell me if it makes its way through.
You're doing a great job, Dave.
It's important to keep it positive.
- So, what happened to Schmidt?
- I don't need him.
I got this on lockdown.
Yes, it is banana-walnut.
Now I'm gonna tell you the story of how my daddy spawned with a pony and made the mud boy that's me.
"Chapter One Mama's House".
Make sure they're sharp.
It's political suicide to not cut the ribbon on the first try.
Of course.
Look, if there's anyone who understand the importance of a sharp knife, it's a Jewish man.
- Hey, listen, about the construction issue - We've discussed that.
Look, changing that schedule's a logistical nightmare, not to mention the people it'll piss off.
The sewage lobby's involved in that project, and trust me, you don't want to cross them.
Did they shoot poopy everywhere?
How old are you?
No.
No, they just They contribute money to my opponent.
Of course.
No, I I knew that.
They Why would they shoot poopy everywhere?
- No.
- Yeah.
Got it.
Hey, listen, I wanted to warn you.
My roommates have recruited a gang of derelicts to to protest the council meeting.
If only there was someone who could oppose them.
Of course, I can't, because it's technically a citizens' forum.
- Are you saying that I should?
- I'm not saying anything.
Oh.
Okay.
You're trying to manipulate me again.
You must think that I'm a real shmendrick.
- Well, hello there.
- When we're in public, - Yeah.
- Let's just tone down the Jewish thing, okay?
- Let's tone down the Jewish thing.
- Yeah.
I can do that.
100%.
Let's tone down the Jewish Hey, by the way, sir, thank you so much for keeping the councilwoman safe.
- Five stars for Arman!
- He's an Uber driver.
- I'm a councilwoman, not a senator.
- Okay, I felt like that First day on the job.
Is this where you tell me to forget everything I learned in training?
N no!
Remember everything.
Bishop, if you have a problem with me being your training officer, put down your ice cream cone, take your frickin' thumbs out of your mouth, and say it to my face!
What?
!
I don't have a problem with you.
Did you or did you not tell your roommates to come check up on me?
- What?
!
They did that?
- Yeah.
Oh, my goodness, I am so "furiated" right now.
I am very lucky to have you as my training officer.
My roommates don't speak for me.
I promise you will never have to see them again.
They're right there.
They're literally right there.
Oh - Oh, yeah, yeah, they see - They got us.
Yeah.
- Hey!
- Hey!
When you step to the badge, the badge step back.
Don't ever say that in my car again.
What the hell are you two doing here?
And why are you talking to Aly behind my back?
She said that you guys gave her weird unwrapped candy and then you stole toilet paper from the station bathroom.
We need that toilet paper.
Because we're worried about you!
We're trying to protect you.
- What?
- She's so small, Winston.
You guys should have faith in me.
I got a badge, I got a diploma, and I got a special plastic thing that goes over my hat for when it rains.
We got a 339 in progress at 62 Sage Brush.
- That sounds dangerous.
Stop him!
- Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
- We can't let you do this!
- We're trying to protect you!
- What the hell is your problem?
- This is scary!
We're not letting you go on the street!
- This an obstruction of justice.
Dude, that is an obstruction - You won't die on my watch!
- Hey!
Hey, Nick.
Nick.
- Oh!
I can't give you these 'cause I care about you.
- Nick, give me the keys.
- Don't give 'em back!
We love you, man!
We love you!
Coach, you know I can't jump that high!
- Don't test me.
- We're protecting you.
Give me those damn keys right Ooh, no, no, no, no !
That's what you get!
Ow!
Ow!
I can't go to jail.
I'm too sarcastic for the white gangs.
Yeah, man, I'll get passed around in there like a bong.
- Shut up.
- Ow!
You're not going to prison.
The dangers of noise pollution are real.
According to the World Wide Web, it can cause lack of concentration, nervousness, and misunderstandings.
Sir!
Sir clearly, manual labor has sculpted your body perfectly, but could you please be quiet?
Sorry, lady, I gotta work all night.
But, sir, people live and work here.
Babies sleep, dogs nap by the window.
Immigrants share noodles and dance to records, with abandon.
You're right!
We should be looking out for each other.
You said it, handsome guy.
But you know who else should be looking out for us?
The city.
Would you stop clapping?
This is an abomination.
By the way, he the only reason he got that role is because he's sleeping with her.
You want to get a cheeseburger sandwich?
- My nights just freed up.
- Of course.
That sounds great now that I can hear you.
- Mm.
Nothing.
- What?
What are you doing?
The cuffs on your jacket just look a little short.
- What?
- They just look a little short.
Why are you telling me this now?
I got a new tailor.
I'm really insecure about it.
- My God.
- I'm Jessica Day.
Thank you for listening.
Tone it down!
Stop the noise!
Ah.
N noise.
N noise.
Where would where would we be without you?
- I don't know.
- A tree falls, a cabin is made, uh It just this doesn't doesn't look right.
A woman screams, a b a baby is b a baby is born.
- Maybe if the speaker would stop fiddling with his jacket - I just It It just doesn't feel like these are - He's saying all the right things.
- That son-of-a-bitch tailor ruined my jacket.
That that baby that screamed becomes a man and that that was the story of Abra Abraham Lincoln.
How dare you evoke Lincoln!
He was our quietest president!
I feel I'm just so I'm so uncomfortable right now, because of my sleeves.
I feel like an idiot up here, in this jacket!
Nobody's telling me my my The tailoring is off!
I'm going I'm seeing I'm seeing a new tailor, everyone.
Sir ?
My tailor's great.
I'll give you his number: Eight.
I look like a freaking matador in this thing!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Sir, we've heard enough.
Stand down!
You look weak!
Considering the incoherent and, frankly, disturbing argument from the pro-noise lobby, I have no choice but to recommend a switch to the day schedule, effective immediately.
New York!
What?
I'm Fawn Moscato, the people's warrior.
You're welcome, Los Angeles!
Tomorrow is a new America!
Good night!
Hello again.
I would like to once more revisit the bottomless clause of the public nudity ordinance.
Oh, my God, I almost hired that guy as a sub.
So, that was a huge failure.
I feel like a Democrat.
Why'd you have to say that about my jacket?
All right.
Okay, look, Jess told me to.
I mean, I thought your sleeves were fine.
And by "fine," I mean I could not care less.
Oh, hello, shark.
I am woman, the smartest species of them all.
I didn't realize I'd finished that.
I've been waiting here a while.
You underhanded pig woman.
You know, there are certain things that you don't do, and exploiting a man's love of tailoring is one of them.
Which makes what you did all the more impressive.
Well, I felt dirty.
I felt like Evil Winston.
Remember when Winston was evil for that week?
I can't believe I blew it with Fawn.
You know, she said that we could have sex in the room where O.J. tried on the glove.
Schmidt, it doesn't matter what happened at the meeting.
She doesn't care about you.
She's a power-hungry, self-obsessed woman who just wants a man to shut up and look pretty.
That's not what you want, is it?
Please take me back.
Look, I was duped by a doe-eyed pixie and her Indian henchwoman.
Forgive me.
It's fine.
It actually worked out.
You were such a jackass up there that no one who supported the construction will be able to hold it against me.
Plus, I picked up a ton of votes.
Or as I like to call them tiny orgasms.
So let me get this straight: You let me humiliate myself, in public, for your own political gain?
Hmm.
Yes.
You're the sexiest woman that I've ever met.
Ms. Moscato, wherever you're going, take me with you.
Please it's "Councilwoman".
And I'll call you when I need you.
That is gonna be so frustrating.
But I love it.
- Why are we in a church?
- I once saw a priest drop his keys and bend over and pick it up, and it was just so human that it ruined religion for me.
It's a support group for families.
- Pack it down.
And you pack it down.
- And now weird friends.
until one day, what happens?
And I know that his training officer is scary strong.
But, um, he's still my friend and the bad guys are still bad and I just wish I could put him in a giant envelope and just just mail him away from all the bad guys There's no shame in this.
Do not judge this man.
We won't.
This is a support group.
I know what you're thinking: he looks like a little punk.
He looks like a little boy.
We we try not to call names here.
- Everybody look down.
Don't look at him!
- Good first day, Bishop.
- You never look at a man when he cries.
- Thanks.
- Back me up, man.
- You ever let your friends try on your uniform?
- What?
No.
- Oh, yeah.
Me either.
Don't do it.
I'm serious.
- Don't do that.
- I won't.
I won't.
I'm telling you, - you gotta keep clear!
- What?
I'm I'm not driving you to the ER this time!
- It's your problem!
- Get out of the way!
Don't look at me like that!
All right, all right!
Morning, Jerry.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- How are you doing?
Eh.
Different day, same bucket, right?
Is that today's Times?
Kristof's got a piece on net neutrality.
It's very complex, I don't know where I stand.
What kind of bagel do you want this morning?
Uh, poppy seed or sesame?
I'm going sesame today.
- All right.
- Get me a little schmear, would you?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
What in the hell is around your neck?
This?
It's a crystal charm, man.
Yeah, the guys at work gave it to me.
- Why?
- Technically, it's "hazing," but, uh, I secretly love it.
That is the kind of crystal that should only rest between a set of old bosoms.
Did that sound just come from your body?
- Hey!
- Ha!
Whoa, how long you two been here?
- When was the last time you asked me that?
- Last Thursday.
So, at least Thursday.
What kind of lazy holes Don't you know what ing day it is?
For crying out l Glen, you should see a doctor.
My name is Schmidt.
And I can't afford to miss work.
I'm sorry, Glen, but I'm with Kai on this one.
Thanks, Wilfred.
You ain't good with names.
Oh, honey, you're all turned around.
- No, you are.
- I think you are.
- I think you are, I'm gonna get you - Stop.
- I've done some research.
- Oh, ooh, how about a head's up, man?
Have I seen those glasses before?
I feel like I want to remember them.
I got these in seventh grade, and I love them.
Stop asking questions.
All right, check it.
So nerd Coach went to the library, and some place that actually exists called the Hall of Documents.
- The downtown branch?
- Mm-hmm.
- How's Kathleen's eye?
- Oh, Kathleen's dead.
- What?
- Yeah.
So, check it out, guys, this is all research.
You two don't have to date in secret anymore at school.
Yeah, it's all here in the Lipinski v. Platte County Unified School District.
Precedence for days!
- Wow.
Wow, you did this for us.
- No.
I just want to pat it.
I just want to, like, frickin' pat it.
I want to nurse it.
Yeah, I want to provide it - with milk.
- Huh.
I used to be the hot teacher.
Now you know how I felt when you turned up.
A miserable path awaits you.
So you want us to come out, so that you can go back to hooking up with all the hot teachers?
Very much so.
But I'm thinking about you guys, too.
I mean, wouldn't it be better if you didn't have to hide your relationship?
Yeah, you know what?
I think we should do this.
I we should do this, let's stop hiding.
Yeah.
But, Jess, will this make things tricky for your work and will it in turn make you distracted and preoccupied - during our splishy-splashy?
- Ugh.
No, no, of course not, I won't let it.
Then let's do this.
Yeah, let's.
Yes!
We are coming out!
Cracking.
I'm chuffed.
Dude, I do not get you.
I trust you, Miss Day.
Mostly because I do not want to read this.
- That's great!
- Well, - Yay!
- I'm the easy one, dawg.
Seriously, it's the teachers you need to worry about.
Especially you.
You tend to care what people think about you.
That's like saying a penguin "tends" to be cute.
It's all it does, bro.
So, good luck when the teachers present their field trip proposals.
If they catch a whiff of favoritism, they are going to tear you apart like like a beautiful baguette, you know what I mean?
When you-you're having dinner, and you just suddenly say, "Hey, forget the bread knife.
Let's just rip into this with our bare hands".
Ah, I love that.
Hey, what'd they say?
What do you got?
You can tell me, I can take it.
I-I don't know if I can take it if If you died, I'd be lost.
J-Just tell me, I'll be there for you, I'm big and strong.
- Is it cancer?
- What's your problem?
Oh, Schmidty, you have cancer?
I can't watch you go through cancer, buddy, you're not strong enough.
What is wrong with you?
!
Your friend keeps forgetting his ulcer medication.
Ulcer medication?
He's lying, please.
Take him home, make sure he does nothing all day.
Look, I'm not doing nothing all day.
Can't take days off wo My firm is wooing red potatoes, and I want that account.
Don't listen to that aggressive male nurse.
He's wearing the same shoes as an old Russian woman.
It's not an ulcer, he's ly Yeah, that's your ulcer telling you to stop being a dick.
Before we begin our presentations, in the spirit of full disclosure and transparency, I have something to tell you.
Mr. Geauxinue and I are dating.
No, n-n-n-no.
- I just felt someone pass over my grave.
- Right.
I don't see a ring.
This is a total joke.
Oh, you're joking.
There's none scenarios that this is possible.
Ladies, I know you're upset, but you know what I do when I'm upset?
I hook up with me.
But I want to assure you that this will not affect my judgment as vice principal.
Let's hear those field trip proposals!
Where are we gonna take those kids, guys?
!
And you know what makes the water delicious?
Taking the poop out.
Hello, water treatment plant.
Okay, we're off to a rocky start.
They've got frickin' mini-golf.
They've got frickin' Skee-Ball.
They've got frickin' bumper boats.
They've got frickin' go-carts.
Is this you topless in the brochure?
It is, thank you.
Take a trip to historical Coach-town.
Lunch will be provided.
I don't eat yesterday's bread.
Yes, you do.
Is there a field trip in here somewhere?
I want to take the children on an interactive nature "experience".
Very hands on.
With, uh, "foll-ahge" "foil-iag-ee" Not bad, um, I'd be a lot more into it if you could pronounce foliage.
I messed it up!
Can't do anything!
So I've arranged for our students to speak to astronauts at the space station, uh, via Russian translator.
And, as an added surprise, actually get to operate the Mars rover.
You see, this is "Mission to Mars: Field Trip to Another World".
Okay, then.
Well, you all had great presentations, but I'm sure no one can accuse me of favoritism when I choose Mr. G's proposal which was so, so, so clearly the best one.
What does space have?
You can't even walk on the ground.
You obviously picked it because he's your frickin' boyfriend.
- Well - I see how it is.
My butt isn't cute enough Should I call my ma and blame her for passing on her wide flat ass?
Hello, Ma?
I'm not calling about that.
Just listen.
I said just listen.
It's about my butt.
Should I continue?
I'm gonna say no.
You won't frickin' get away with this.
Eat glass and die, you tramp!
Mrs. Raws!
- Uh, you're not going to work.
- What are you talking?
- You're not going to work.
- Yes, I'm going to work!
Sit down!
Sit down!
Of course I'm going to work.
Gina needs me.
Besides, I like my stomach like I like my suits no lining.
Here, take your bottoms off, put these sweatpants on.
- You take your bottoms off, sir!
- Why don't you take your slacks off, so I can put some sweatpants on?
Now take your bottoms off.
I'm not gonna sit around here all day like an off-duty ice cream truck driver!
I confiscated three laptops, two tablets and an e-reader.
Oh, and this satellite phone with a condom taped to it.
- My earthquake kit?
- Hey, look for starters, Schmidt, you're sitting up way too straight.
I feel like I'm sitting just fine.
Take a deep breath Inhale it all the way in Now let it go.
Now let go.
Now let go I I am letting go.
You're like a clenched fist, my man.
Open up.
You're in a 1920s boxing stance.
- This is a waste of time!
- You're not going to work!
I have a hyperactive nephew!
We have to swaddle him!
Swaddle nothing!
What?
- What are you doing?
!
- Swaddle him!
Get him!
Gotta get to work!
Shh.
Shh Shh you relaxed?
Yeah.
Okay, ready?
You're gonna lay down.
All right, just for a minute.
Good night, Schmidty.
- Now do me.
- Okay.
Hey, what's up, girl?
Hey, uh remember when we used to do it and it was dope?
- Nah.
- Nah?
What you talk?
- You still like Ryan?
- Well It's just the accent.
That's the only thing that you You like the accent.
I can do an accent.
Ah can do an accent.
You like when I do this accent, eh?
You like when I do the accent?
Not at all.
My dad makes cheese He just made me realize that I want guys who have, like, frickin' feelings and stuff.
Yeah, well But the boy looks like he was raised in a muffin.
Oh.
Hey.
I've been holding office hours all year and this is the first time anyone's taken me up on it.
Ryan took you up on it, didn't he?
This is gonna be fine and, um, I'm going to address all of your problems one by one.
- It just ain't right.
- Okay.
"Ain't right".
Anything else?
It's not okay.
"Not okay".
What else?
I'm not all right with it.
And when you lent me that sweater last week, - was I supposed to, like - Ruth!
It's unscrupulous, Ms. Day.
If you two are coming out, we are, too.
Meet my boyfriend.
So you like teachers?
I'd do whatever it takes to get my foliage trip off the ground.
And now I know how things work around here.
And you're not even my type, just so you know.
Ba-da-da Don't do that.
I'd be way more into this if you had, like, a classic Latin build.
Okay, stop.
Stop!
'Cause I'm a ginger?
Just get out.
Ms. Day!
Okay!
I changed my mind.
We're gonna look at foliage.
Now, will that make you people go back to your jobs?
Yeah.
I won something.
I won something.
Hey.
What's going on?
Everybody was just so mad at me.
I feel terrible.
This is my fault.
Jess, maybe I should look for another job.
No!
No!
Absolutely not.
No, look, I have everything under control.
I am 100% confident that I'm making the right decision.
You got girl troubles, get a crystal.
Look, I'm telling you, Coach, women have been checking me out all day.
From the gentleman across the bar.
This is my favorite drink.
How did he?
Something powerful told me it was.
Now, they gave me this crystal to help me on the streets, but I'm starting to think it's gonna help me in the sheets.
Winston, look at me.
Mm-hmm.
And I have never been more serious about anything in my life.
- Okay.
- Stop rhyming.
All the timing?
I don't need a crystal, I just need to be more frickin' sensitive, so stop trying to give me your crystal!
Okay.
I'm not supposed to be yelling.
That's what I'm I need to be working I need to work on that.
I'm telling you, man, this crystal gives you the courage to do the one thing that you're scared of the most.
To me, it's country music line dancing.
Well, that is terrifying.
Don't do that.
You guys seen Schmidt?
What the hell?
My word processor?
You can't Kathy Bates me forever!
My work needs me.
Gina needs me.
I'm sorry, but she's trying to kill you and I'm trying everything in my power to stop her.
No, you're trying to turn me into you.
Aren't you bored, Nick?
I've been doing nothing for exactly one day and I already feel pathetic.
The Nick that I met in college would not be happy living like this.
- You've changed.
- That's not true.
I've always been lazy.
Physically, yes.
But mentally, you used to be like a da Vinci in tie-dye.
Well, I'll be.
Think differently.
The beer teat!
- Awesome, bro.
- Ha!
Party!
Well, you changed, too.
You used to live by your own rules.
You were like a fat, Jewish Dennis Rodman.
But look at you now.
You're like the back of a horse in a two-person horse costume with Gina just farting in your face all day long.
That actually happened.
What?
!
Schmidt, tell me, what do you get for all your hard work?
- The sponge account.
- Oh, great!
God willing, it'll get me red potatoes, too.
Sexiest starch since jasmine rice.
Great.
I hope your work keeps making you walk around with your guts in a rusty old wagon.
Oh, hey, Nick.
You're up early.
Before noon.
Oh, wait, is this Sleepwalk Nick?
Man, I love Sleepwalk Nick!
He always pays back the money that Awake Nick borrows from me.
Of course I'm up!
I'm doinstuff.
I do stuff.
I clean.
I'm cooking right now.
I'm cooking breakfast.
Sun's up, Miller's up.
People say that.
Huh.
Oh, hey, Coach.
You're dressed like Ryan.
What?
No, you see, I-I I've had these clothes for forever, I just don't wear them when you're around.
- You are dressed like Ryan!
- Are you around me all the time?
No.
Dressing up like someone else isn't going to work.
- Unlike this crystal - Shut up.
And I am never taking this crystal off.
Well, I mean, except if I'm making a tomato sauce and the crystal keeps dipping in the tomato sauce.
Then I'll take it off, and that's just being practical.
I don't know too much about crystal care, but, oh, I intend to find out.
See?
I made the right decision.
Kids need to be in nature.
Emily Kopnik saw a butterfly and she said, "Oh, my God, - country lice can fly".
- Oh, cool.
Well, I'm sensitive and I care about things like that.
- Do you like leaves, Eddie?
- No.
Me, too, buddy.
Me, too.
So rake 'em into a observational mound or "a pile" and then we transfer the piles into one of these special research bags which you kids can take home.
Hey.
What's happening here?
Here's another rake.
You're not just having the kids, uh, rake the leaves and put them in a bag, - are you?
- What now?
I mean, do, uh what else do you have planned?
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm a biology professional.
So, how's that phantom ulcer treating you?
I sent you those Q4 reports Horrible burning!
Well, I'm glad you're back.
See?
Look how glad I am.
Gina, let me run point on red potatoes.
I've got three pitches already ready to rock.
Here's a taste.
That's the first one.
That's the first pitch.
"Here'a taste".
It's just a picture of a red potato, and the tagline is: "Here's a here's a taste".
There's that New York sense of humor again, Schmidt.
Come on, Gina.
Give me a shot at red potatoes.
No way, 'cause I need you.
You're the best sort of mid-level employee I've ever had.
You are the ass to my horse.
And I'm gonna keep you right here, right by my side, where I can find you.
Forever.
Forever?
Yeah, speaking of Forever?
Yeah, speaking of might need you to suit up for my son's birthday this Saturday, so What are these?
Doesn't matter.
Keep your phone on, okay?
You know, sometimes I think about life, and it just makes me want to cry.
Respond to my sharing, please.
You're putting on a real creepy, murdery vibe today.
- Just FYI.
- I'm not trying to do that.
I was Just, like, going forward in your day, - you should know that.
- Just trying to be, like, feeling - Hey, guys.
- Hi.
What's going on?
I think they might just be doing - frickin' yard work.
- I don't know What I been told I don't know what I been told Whoa.
Foster's butt is mighty old Foster's butt is mighty old Oh, we're violating every child labor law.
They're really good singers.
Keep up the rhythm.
Mama won't be happy till you clear the back forty.
Biology teacher?
Is this your house?
Did you bring the kids here to work?
First of all, my name is Lorenzo.
Secondly, yes.
But you're the one who picked my trip, so it's your fault.
Can I have some water?
- Okay, guys, stop working.
- Don't listen to her.
Keep working.
You don't have to work.
- I'm the vice principal.
- Not technically at school, so keep working.
- Stop working!
- Keep working!
Wasps!
Everybody stay calm!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, they're getting in my eyes.
Aah!
Damn you bees!
Ah!
They got me!
Ah, screw it.
Here comes me.
I sting too, bees.
Bees don't bother me.
Seems like it was a great field trip.
So sorry I missed it.
I feel like a bunch of tiny people are holding tiny little lighters to my face.
Today was a complete and total disaster, from start to finish.
I've never failed so hard at my job ever in my life.
Everyone's so mad at me, but I was just trying - to make them happy.
- Jess, you can't make everyone happy.
You don't need them to like you.
You just need them to listen to you.
- You're the boss.
- Yeah.
I mean, if you were a man dating someone at work, do you think that you would be worried about what everyone else was thinking?
You'd be, like, in the conference room, like, "Meeting adjourned.
Except for you, Sheila".
But that's not me.
I care what people think.
I always have.
Then your only option is to go in and be yourself.
Just got to own it.
I think I'm a little scared.
Well, that's very interesting.
You see - Have you been here this whole time?
- The entire time.
That is why God made crystals.
Why did he make that shirt?
Hey.
- Hey, look, Nick, I got to talk to you.
- I got to talk to you.
- You go first.
- You go first.
Okay, you know what?
You were right, Nick.
I am a corporate monkey.
I don't want to be an old man looking back on a meager life of selling red potatoes for the man.
I don't want to be a lazy bum my whole life.
I want to be the kind of bum that other bums look at and say, "What's that bum smiling about"?
I get that.
I just had an idea, Schmidt.
I just had an idea, too, but I feel like it's stupid.
- I feel like mine's stupid.
Let's do it.
- I'm gonna I'm just gonna I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
- But I want to hear what you have to say.
It's important to me 'Cause maybe it's the same thing, maybe it's different.
It might be the same thing, so maybe we should just say it.
- You want to do the classic on 11?
- Yeah, okay, great.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11 - Let's work together again!
- Let's work together again!
- Yes!
I knew it!
That was awesome!
- That was it, man.
That was it.
Back in business.
Yeah!
Let's start jamming ideas.
Turkey.
Robot.
Turkey robot.
Just got it in one.
- All right, let's draw up a - I don't think we did.
Okay.
Ready?
Black.
Robot.
Black robot.
- Ooh, that's even better, son.
- Boom.
- Let's push for number two.
- Let's let's - Exactly - Black robot.
The blackest robot in town.
That robot's so black, it's the blackest.
I feel like marketing's gonna be a nightmare on that one.
Okay.
I'm not good at marketing.
I'm good at ideas.
- Let's stay away from robots.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
All right.
- Okay.
Robot robot.
I said let's stay away from robots, though, - and you just said ro - Okay.
- Black turkey!
- Look, let's maybe pick it up later.
- Computers for babies.
- We are back!
Hair that looks like a helmet.
Or vice versa helmet that looks like a hair is actually pretty smart.
Oh, I'm really hot right now.
A water bottle with the top cut off.
- That's a cup!
- That is just a cup.
Scratch it.
Ladies.
- Ooh you got bee'd up, dude.
- Yeah.
- You look like a monster.
- Yeah.
I'm not even joking.
- You look so ugly right now.
- So ugly.
Look, I'm not some little sensitive British guy, okay?
I am Coach.
But right now, I am in so much pain that I am losing my mind.
And I might never recover.
So say hello to the new me, who's basically a street lunatic with a face made of fire!
They sting you in your pants?
Yeah, they they stung my doodad.
I'm gonna get you some lotion.
- Ow.
- Ooh!
Everyone, um, before we begin this meeting, I just want to say that yes, Ryan is my boyfriend.
And yes, I let it affect my job because I care what you think of me, and I always have.
But here's what you should know: I love my job, and I love this man right here.
Wow.
I've been waiting for a moment to tell you that, and I guess this is it.
This is perfect.
And, uh, just for the record, I love you, too.
This speech is wonderful, so please keep going.
Oh, yeah.
Um, and you can come to me with any problems or anything you want to ask me, but I'm gonna make some decisions that you don't like, and you're just gonna have to deal with it.
So, uh, let's get back to work, okay?
So, is that the end of the meeting, then?
Yep.
Uh yeah, I got a little carried away with the moment there.
Anyway - Put it on.
- Put the crystal on.
And There we go.
Not gonna do anything.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
You know how a computer is this big.
What if a computer was this big?
The size of a man's hand.
And had a camera in it, and you can take self pictures, and it also had a phone?
So you could store it easily It's kind of a good idea.
- Draw it up by noon.
- Quit bossing me around.
This makes me impatient.
And it makes me also so furious.
I need 45 minutes away from you.
And then we can be best friends again.
Don't follow me out.
So, as you guys know, Schmidt and I are business partners.
We've been working on an idea we're very excited about.
We e-mailed our plans to a guy in China, and the prototype is here.
And we've got a pitch meeting set up - with Lori Greiner.
- From QVC?
- That the one.
- That's right.
You know, Fawn and I were paired with her in a charity golf tournament.
You know, they laughed at me for playing the ladies' tees, but it paid off.
She's a shark.
Ha!
A shark golfing.
Now I'd buy that T-shirt.
Friends, imagine yourself in this scenario.
- You're at the local gymnasia.
- Oh You're schvitzing up a storm.
Suddenly, you get a text message.
There's an emergency wedding down at the town hall.
But what'll I wear?
I mean, I'm sweating at the gym.
Huh, I don't know what's going on.
I love this.
Ladies and gentlemen, - may I present to you - Game time.
- The Swuit!
- The Swuit!
Ugh.
The Swuit.
The Swuit.
It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.
- Well?
- This is it?
- What do you guys think?
- This looks like garbage.
It looks like garbage.
- I don't think it looks like relax.
- Nick, it looks like garb - It's embarrassing.
Put it away.
- The bottoms aren't great, but the top Well, I like it.
I mean, I like you guys.
All right, I'm gonna go throw this out.
No, don't throw it away!
Why, you want to wear it?
No.
No, no, no, no.
No.
He said, "Do you want to wear it"?
No, I just I think I was gonna put it in the Goodwill bin at school.
As lining for the bottom.
- Get rid of it.
It's a piece of crap.
- We're-we're screwed.
Guys, you're starting a business.
There are gonna be some setbacks.
We don't have enough time, okay?
I'm running out of vacation days, and our pitch meeting with Lori is on Friday.
Friday?
!
You never told me Friday.
He never told - Guys - I told you a hundred times it was on Friday.
That sounds like it could be right, yeah.
Could be Friday.
Yeah.
Now we need another good idea in four days.
Ah, I can't work under pressure like this.
You know that I get nervous.
I am just a man.
I am not a god.
Uh, I think we're all aware of that.
Why you talking like that?
Like what?
Well, we're all aware of that.
Guys, stop fighting!
You're upsetting Winston.
It's so early.
You made me swallow my night guard.
Oh, please, it's a paperclip with gum wrapped around it.
We're in a crunch.
Good morning!
Made you guys some brain food.
Ah, thank you.
I'm supposed to hang out with Kai later and do nothing.
This'll help.
No time.
The pitch is on Friday.
I'm gonna need one good idea every 20 seconds.
Ugh.
- Oh, you're gonna time me now?
- Yes.
It'll help you concentrate.
It's too beepy-boppy.
Well, it's brain music.
Go.
Look away.
This is exciting.
I feel like I'm in the garage at Cupertino.
This sounds like the video in middle school that taught me about periods.
And time!
All right.
Let's see what you got.
"I am the Karduthian champion of of dance".
"Beer bread".
Beard bread.
Bread that is in your beard.
That's an that's an invention?
Or is that just something that happens to you?
You think Hewlett had to put up with this crap from Packard?
Again.
Oh, now I'm Packard?
Enough!
You can't come up with a good idea being all loosey-goosey.
Why don't you tell that to Howard Hughes, the inventor of the Loose Goose?
That was the Spruce Goose, and it didn't work!
It did work!
It flew for over a mile at an altitude of 72 feet!
How on Earth do you know that information and not know the name of it?
I don't want to stick my nose in someone else's rose, but what I'm hearing is two very passionate partners with two totally different approaches.
- You hit the nail right on the head!
- That is a correct assessment - of what is going on right now.
- And thank you for breakfast!
I'm gonna shove this bacon right in my mouth and savor it for life.
That omelette was so delicious!
You know what, you guys are saying really nice things to me, but you're both shouting Such a delicious omelette!
The presentation's fantastic!
One of the most delicious things I've ever had.
You've outdone yourself.
Definitely appreciated!
- Don't follow me.
- Don't follow me!
All they care about is who's the boss.
Of course that's all they care about, Jess.
It's a guy thing.
It's in our DNA.
Look, Nick's not gonna let Schmidt boss him around, and vice versa.
Don't get me started on the male power dynamic.
I will talk your ear off.
They're being such dudes right now.
It's, like, all about who's got the bigger you-know-what.
Oh, I do know what.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What can we do to make them collaborate?
You can eliminate their you-know-whats.
That was a joke.
You want to hang out tonight and have ninja turtle sex?
What's ninja turtle sex?
Sex with backpacks on.
: Oh, sex with backpacks on!
Yes, I would love to, but I can't.
I got to do some work, or Schmidt will put me in the "Think Harder" box, which is basically just a refrigerator box that he hits with a baseball bat.
Gets me to think harder.
Talk later?
- Yeah.
- Great.
I really hope that you enjoyed your service today, and please come back Okay.
Thanks a lot, big spender.
You should probably show some clavicle.
No.
I need bigger tips.
They're raising my college tuition, and if I don't come up with the money by Friday, I got to drop out.
So I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Wow, Cece, look.
I mean, we're your friends.
If you want, I can give you money.
You can give her money.
I ain't giving her a damn thing I think what Coach is trying to say is that he will also give you money.
Look, that's very sweet, but the last thing I want is charity, okay?
And don't tell Jess, because she just goes nuts anytime she thinks I need money.
So I don't think I can afford to go home for my aunt's birthday.
You need money?
I'm selling my hair!
Oh!
Hi.
Hello!
You're a handsome fella.
Can I interest you in a drink or Oh, you suck!
We got to do something.
Winston, for the first time in my life, I'm not 100% broke, and you want me to give my money away?
No, sir.
She said she didn't want charity.
I ain't giving it to her.
Oh, crap.
Am I stuck doing another thing with you again?
It's a classic Winston and Coach mess-around!
All right.
But don't say that.
What if I put your name first?
Let me hear it.
It's a classic Coach and Winston mess-around.
- Regardless, I don't like it.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, Schmidt.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Nick.
Well, you know what, he's got a real head - full of dog dirt.
- Mm.
So I noticed you're having trouble working with Schmidt.
He's a bossy old tuna.
Well, we both know you are the boss.
Thank you.
- But we both know he's not the boss.
- Exactly.
Maybe you could back off a little, since Nick's been having, you know, man problems.
"Man problems"?
Man problems.
Huh.
Are we talking clog or leak?
He's got the wet Tuesdays?
You think it's 'cause of his tight denim pants?
Did the squirrels get to the tulip bulbs?
Mm-hmm.
And that's why you have to make him feel like he's the boss right now.
Yeah, of course.
It's the least that I could do.
Well, I had no idea Schmidt had a cranky dank.
So, yeah, I'll let him be the boss.
I'm amazing.
What?
- I'm amazing.
- What?
What?
Huh?
What?
Hmm?
Hmm, this is a bit of an unprecedented group, the three of us.
This isn't a social call, young lady.
- Oh.
- This is strictly business.
Here's the deal.
You need money for college.
No.
No, okay?
- I am not a charity case.
- This isn't charity.
- No.
No, we've gone through this.
- This is an investment.
Nick and Schmidt are looking for investors, so we thought it would be fun if we got into investing, too.
You're smart, you're driven.
We are confident in a very robust ROI.
ROI means "Return On Investment".
- I know what it stands for.
- I've been reading a lot of Schmidt's investment books in the toilet.
Life hack: the toilet paper makes for a very, very handy bookmark.
Life hack: read your phone on the toilet like everybody else.
- Ooh.
- The answer is gonna be no, all right?
Because when you borrow money from friends, things get weird N-N-No, do not mistake this for friendship, young lady, all right?
As far as I'm concerned, you're just a walking treasury bond.
Within three years of graduation, you will pay us back in full, plus ten percent of the principal.
I really don't want to do this.
At all.
But There's always a "but," huh?
But I don't really have any other choice.
- Yes!
- You were right, man.
So I guess we're in business, boys.
Yes.
We wrote the check out to Cece.
We do not know your full name.
- This is looking really good.
- It's absolutely stunning.
This is this is your vision from start to finish.
I might be the seed, but you're the farmer.
Hey, you two look like you're really getting along.
Yeah, well, you know what, who wouldn't get along with this brave, masculine, healthy cowboy?
What you got there?
It's a camera attachment.
That keeps the attention of your dog while you're taking its picture.
- Oh.
- Schmidt came up with a great title for it.
It's called "Perfect Pet Pic".
This is just a prototype that dumb-old me came up with.
If he put it together, it'd be a lot better, I promise you that.
Now, of course, could-could you just hold some pet food in your other hand?
Sure.
But this is a lifestyle product.
That's actually really impressive.
I think Lori's gonna like that.
You know, I had a vision of what this product would look like.
And you carried it out and exceeded my expectations in a way that I don't know.
It-it's touching.
Sometimes I feel like you're my arms.
I'm really proud of the way that you're handling this.
I'm proud of the way that you've handled this.
What have I handled?
Y-Your man problems.
No, honey, you're the one with the man problems.
I don't have the man problems.
I'm being so nice to you because you're the one who has the man problems.
No, no, no, sweetheart, I'm only being nice to you 'cause - you have man problems, and I feel sorry - No, you have man problems and that's why I'm being nice to you right now.
- Honey, honey, honey - What man problems did you think I had?
Something hangy.
Hang?
You think I had something hanging off - What'd you think I had?
!
- I don't want to get too graphic, but I I was picturing something gooey.
Gooey's not the worst I've had gooey.
Oh, good God, what?
Simply ignore it.
Who told you about my man problems?
Who told you about my man?
Look, the only reason why I did this was to get you guys to stop arguing about who's the boss Don't you be sorry!
Jess, you did nothing wrong!
You're nothing but an angel!
You tried to help us, which is a sweet move!
You tried to help a situation - You're yelling nice things at me again!
- which was at a boiling point.
- It's very confusing!
- This is his fault!
He's been bossing me around for ten years!
If I hadn't been bossing you around, you would just be a bartender with a lot of ideas and the ambition of a dead person.
I will never let you boss me around again.
Not even if the lives of Fine, if-if I take that part back.
If a bunch of kids' lives depended on it, - I'd let you boss me around.
- You went way too far - in that moment.
- Fine, but you understand my point.
If there were five kids whose life - depended on it, I wouldn - Not even five kids.
- Okay, I No kids, I don't Pretend I - Just take the kids out.
I understand the point you're trying to make!
The company is dead!
That's the point.
I'm going to that pitch meeting tomorrow with Lori Greiner without you.
You know why?
Because a boss never breaks appointments.
You think I was born in the middle of the afternoon?
You're gonna go into that pitch and take all the credit?
Fine, go to that pitch together, and then me and you, we're done.
- Fine, I'm done with you.
- Don't speak to me until bedtime.
If you think we're gonna have a bedtime chat, you're out of your mind.
We'll lay in beds, and we'll just over the day together - like we usually do and that's it!
- No.
Fine, we'll do that for a little bit.
That's it.
That's it.
Here, take it.
I don't even need it anymore.
Bedtime chat's gonna be so short, you won't believe it.
- Oh, I'll believe it.
- You won't believe it.
Thought you might not show.
I drove you here, Nicholas.
Let's just get through this thing, - and then we can be done with each other, okay?
- Okay.
And, by the way, stay out of my way in there.
I'm about to blow the roof off of this thing with a little something I like to call the "Seven S's".
I bet you don't have any more than four.
- Yeah?
Watch me.
- Go ahead.
Strategy, sizzle, Schmidt, - sex - Go on.
Stop interrupting me.
I got I got more.
Salesmanship.
Something.
Synergy.
- Boom.
Nailed it.
- Damn it.
That's seven How you like me now?
All right, that's really good, but it's not gonna matter, 'cause the only thing that matters is what I have.
A prototype.
So stay out of my way in there, and let me just show her the prototype, because that's all we need.
We don't need a prototype.
- Did you forget the prototype?
- No.
Did you forget the prototype?
No.
Did you forget the prototype?
Yeah.
Where'd you leave it, Nick?
I still believe in them though.
Part of me thinks that even though they're mad at each other, they'll get in there, and they'll figure it out.
I don't think that's the case.
Why are you being so negative?
'Cause they left their stupid thing.
What?
!
Oh, crap.
I'm delivering a prototype And drinking a big coffee Oh, crap.
Nick, what is the matter with you?
Well, I wouldn't have forgot it if you didn't bully me to get out of the house an hour early!
- It was too fast!
I needed time!
- You lay on the ground!
You guys ready?
- Yeah.
- Yes, of course.
Absolutely.
I'm talking about postwar.
That's after the war.
Prewar would be something different completely.
I was in London postwar, post-postwar, in '77, and, uh I caught a few shows.
The flights were Well, I think I spent two maybe $250 to get to : Guess who?
What are you doing here?
I'm just checking in on my investment.
Oh, my Hey, check it out.
I'm a campus cutie.
- No, you are not.
- What are we learning?
Shh!
I am studying Postwar British Art History.
- What?
- Post Br-British who?
What's that?
That's just a bunch of words that mean "Screw you, investors".
What else you taking?
Intro to Afrikaans.
What else?
Astronomy 101?
That's next semester.
Wow.
What you gonna do, Cece, join the South African space program and be the first woman to put a David Hockney painting on the moon?
Who is David Hockney?
Excuse me, can I help you?
- No, no, we're okay, sorry.
- Yes, can you please, um, tell my investment here We're okay, we're that she can't make any money with art history.
That's not true.
Last year I made almost $22,000, and my life is very hard.
You see that?
You should be studying to become a doctor.
They make good money, they get respect.
Paging Dr. Cece.
A doctor?
We wouldn't see a penny for at least 12 years.
Here's what you should be focused on, okay?
Something with a low risk, high reward, and that thing Do not say hotel management.
- Hotel management.
- Oh, my gosh.
Look, man, it is a secure living and it's great way to meet people.
Do you mind telling me where I might find more information on hotel management?
Uh, the dog, uh the dog You put the food in the thing.
Uh, and then the dog sees it, and, uh, the food's dangle-dang uh, it's dangling.
To, uh, do-do-do Dog Looks at dang-dang.
Tail wag-wag, uh, rev dog wagging the ta Um, whatever dog's name is.
Dog's name is Claire.
Claire come in.
- Who-who's Claire?
- Shh.
Uh, Claire sees dog food.
Pic, Facebook, like, like, like Sizzle Pet Pic - strategy, sex, something.
- Strategy, sex, something.
- S-Something.
- Something.
This is the worst pitch I have ever seen.
: Sorry.
Sorry to interrupt.
Gentlemen, your prototype.
Wait, what are you wearing?
This?
This is the Swuit!
It's a suit made entirely of sweat suit material.
It was invented by Nick and Schmidt, and like them, it's the perfect combination.
That one over there, he's all creativity and ideas.
Thoughts and notions.
And this one's all data and numbers.
Six.
He can just keep going.
The Swuit goes from day to night and night to play.
Take my friend Nick here for example.
I mean, this is a man who would wear sweatpants to his wedding.
- I now pronounce me comfortable.
- Look, Lori, you get it.
- Look, Lori, you get it.
- Lori, you get it.
- Do it together.
No one doesn't love the Swuit.
Don't settle for substitutes.
Swettle for swub-si-swuits.
No?
I've got to stop drinking on the golf course.
- To the Swuit!
- The Swuit!
Hey, how'd it go?
- She like the Perfect Pet Pic?
- Even better.
She hated the Swuit.
Yeah, she's got a similar product on QVC called the Scruit.
It's a suit made of scrubs.
It was developed for prison weddings.
Yeah, paid us $10,000 to kill the Swuit.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
So, Nick, are you finally free to do nothing?
Not so fast there, lady.
Uh, old Schmidty-bangs and I have to get working on our next idea.
That is, if you'll still have me, buddy.
Come on, man.
Of course I'll have you.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I was looking at you the whole time.
Don't say anything.
When I say that, just let me say that and take a moment where you're like, "Wow, he's about to say something".
You kept you kept saying it as if I wasn't looking at you.
But what I'm clearly doing is saying, "Look at me".
And what you're supposed to do is be like, "Ah".
And then I'm gonna say something.
- Ah.
- Look at L-Let me say it first.
- All right, guess what?
- Gone.
Now.
We back?
Of course, man.
- Come here.
- Ah, come on.
- Come on.
- Come on, come here.
Come on.
- Come here.
- Come here.
- Just meet in the middle.
- Dynamic duo.
- Dynamic duo.
- Batman and Robin.
- Yeah, I'm Batman.
- I'm Batman, for sure.
You guys just made ten grand.
What are we doing drinking booze that you didn't buy?
- Let's go.
- Yeah!
- Let's do it, all right!
- Yeah!
Hey, can we talk for a minute?
Yeah, sure.
Wow, that is some serious shade.
I guess we deserve that.
- Yep.
- Cece, look, I know I got carried away with the whole investing thing.
So I'm sorry.
Ooh, an Afrikaans dictionary.
Yeah, it was not easy to find.
Read the inside cover.
"Whatever drawings you talk about, always shoot for the stars.
Winston and Coach".
It's very sweet, guys.
Thank you.
That makes zero sense.
I know, it makes no sense.
Hey!
Huzzah!
Nick Miller, friend, businessman.
This one's for you.
What is she doing now?
I think she's making herself some tea.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's up?
Are you okay?
- Kai broke up with me.
- No.
I'm sorry, dude.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
She said she wants to be with somebody who can just sit on the couch all day.
She said I'm too ambitious; she said I work too hard.
Nah, it was the It's not funny.
It's just that when you said that out loud, it made me laugh.
I'm really sorry about Kai.
She seemed like a great girl, but on the bright side, in all your years on this planet, has anyone ever dumped you for working too hard?
No.
No, it's mostly 'cause I'm either too poor or too sticky.
So this is a big day then.
For the first time in my life, I really want to do something with this, you know?
I really want to make this business work.
Schmidt, tomorrow, let's start bright and early, 7:00 a.m. No, no, no, Nick, I want to do it your way.
Let's wake up at 12:00 noon.
Just said your way.
- Hey, guys, how about 9:30?
- Now that's a genius right there.
- 9:30, let's say 9:30.
- Let's meet in the middle.
What's that book?
- Oh, nothing, it's not even a - General artifact.
They're giving out books at the bar now for kids.
- What is it, seriously?
- It's mine.
Winston and Coach gave it to me.
They're helping me with money for my tuition.
- You need money?
- No, it's gonna be fine.
Jess Oh my God.
I'm selling my car.
No Je No, no.
It's gonna be It's gonna be fine, OK?
I guess we have to listen to this whole song.
Not a fan.
Kill me please.
The worst.
Now we taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
Taking care of business.
And working overtime.
Work it out.
Hey, guys, we're in a bar.
We're not in the loft!
You're right, you're right.
Calm down.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- Hello!
- Hey.
- Hi.
Happy St. Valentine's Day, mates.
I just spent the week at Ryan's, and it was absolutely lovely.
Fake accent, smug attitude This is exactly why the teachers have turned on Jyan.
Jyan?
!
Come on!
You chose the worst parts of both our names.
That's why we chose it.
Haters gonna "H".
That's why Ryan has to find a new job.
You know, I hear Elijah Wood's looking for a stunt double.
He's so small!
Get back in that tree and make me - some cookies, Ryan!
Cookies!
- Yeah!
I know, so hot, right?
Anyway, what's going on in your little lives?
Well, I'm just enjoying the fruits of dating a semi-powerful local politician.
Tonight, it's a Valentine's Day cardiologists' soiree.
- Check that out.
- Oh!
Oh, my goodness.
Is that the invitation?
Wait, that's a real heart?
Looks like meat.
- It's not shaped like this?
- Yeah, well, you know, the cardiologists feel that the traditional cartoon heart, uh - promotes ignorance.
- That's gross.
Where's Nick?
How is he handling the breakup with Kai?
I don't know I haven't seen Fat Fat Fatty in a long time.
- Yeah, me, either.
- Yeah, I haven't seen him since the breakup.
You live in the same room as him.
I've been crashing in your room while you're away.
Is Nick missing?
No, he is not.
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.
- Oh, wow.
- You look terrible.
Hey, Nick.
Are you covered in gravy?
Nope.
I've been in my room for the last week sleeping and thinking and really getting into the comic strip Cathy.
Oh, I'm really excited that we can finally talk about Cathy.
When she's mad, she says, "Ack".
- Ack.
- Ack.
- Ack!
- Nick, why would you come out here?
Sounds like you were doing pretty good in there.
Doug's Ale House.
- The new bar on Sixth and Spring?
- No.
The exact coordinates to complete my bar crawl that I've been working on for almost a decade.
- Mmm.
- What?
!
- Ooh.
- Big day.
- Thanks.
And guess what?
Good news.
It's tonight!
Who's in?
- Oh - You know, I'm on call at the station tonight, so I can't really drink, so Fawn's speaking at a cardiologist event.
Ryan and I have a reservation at a really fancy restaurant, so You're probably thinking, "Oh, a bar crawl on Valentine's Day Is this about Nick's breakup with Kai"?
No.
- Yeah.
- Now you might be asking yourself, "Is attendance really mandatory"?
You bet it is.
Bar crawl!
Hmm He's about to crack.
We have to go tonight.
So I have news about a bar Cr Was I just out here talking to you guys about the bar crawl?
Did I already pitch it all to you?
Well, it's happening tonight!
Okay, so we hit six bars in five hours.
Wait, wouldn't six hours make more sense?
Yeah, that'd make sense 'cause it all divides No, no, it doesn't, because it's it's five hours.
Now, the amazing thing is, if you connect all the coordinates, the six bars form a perfect smiley face on the map look.
You didn't actually connect all the coordinates.
- Oh, my - Hey, I think it is a really cool smiley face.
- Thank you.
- I got your back, man.
I got your back.
Actually, I have all your backs, all right?
Uh, since I can't drink tonight, I am your designated buddy.
Here in my backpack, I have a list of items that we may need.
I got water, so - I got towels for everybody.
- Perfect.
I got small stick.
- Speaks for itself.
- Oh.
Oh.
Also one female condom.
It's gonna go quick, so I'll let you two fight it out.
Uh-uh.
Also, I got - tissues for you, Nick, 'cause - What for?
It's-it's Valentine's Day, and your girlfriend broke up.
- You guys can be sad - Move it right along, man.
Cool it.
And the bar crawl starts - now!
- Now!
Actually, where's Schmidt?
Well, it's with a heavy heart Oh!
that we really must leave you.
We really must.
He's too much.
It was a pleasure.
Pleasure.
Easy on the puns, okay?
And you've got broccoli in your teeth.
Remember what I told you about eating at public functions?
- Only use your back teeth.
- Only use your back teeth.
Hey, Fawn, I'm sorry.
We should probably get to Nick's bar crawl now, yeah?
You remember?
I confirmed it like ten times with your intern.
Yes, yes, yes, no.
First, I need to, uh, schmooze some vascular surgeons.
Gotta get a discount on my spider vein removal.
Okay?
Okay, ten minutes tops.
We're still going to dinner, 'cause it took a lot to get this reservation.
Also, we can't get wasted 'cause it's a very nice restaurant.
Which means we have to pretend to drink in front of Nick.
Is that really necessary?
Oh, yakkety-yakkety-yak.
Don't ruin my bar crawl.
Let's go.
Drink.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Mmm, mmm.
Boom!
I'm gonna outdrink you tonight, Miller.
Cece, your mouth is writing a check that your body can't find.
That's not an expression.
Regionally specific to Northern Illinois.
We say it all the time.
- Thank you, Winston.
- You're welcome.
Don't write a check your body can't find.
Every day, man.
- For real.
- Got to.
Got to.
A gimlet for May.
Thank you.
Watch and learn, player.
If you're a girl and you're in a bar on Valentine's Day, you're basically saying, "Hello.
Good February.
I'm interested in casual sex".
Hmm.
May, huh?
- That's your name?
- Yeah.
Ah, that's crazy 'cause, uh I know I just met you, but your name's already written on my heart.
It's fate, baby.
- It's fate seriously?
- All right, come on!
Five-minute - warning, let's go.
- Dude, I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Oh, no, nope, you're in the middle of nothing, because that's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.
She hates you, Ernie.
But I don't like her for you, anyway.
Let's go.
- Wait, what do you mean?
- I just don't know what to do.
No schools are hiring.
I've contacted everyone I know.
I even checked through all my contacts in England, including my old headmaster at Wellington Prep, to see if he knew of anything in the States.
Where there's a will, there's a Wellington way.
- How do you know the Wellington fight song?
- You sing it in your sleep.
- Oh, God.
- Look, don't worry, - you're gonna find a job.
- I'm just worried about not seeing you - as much if I switch schools.
- Well I'll just have to sleep over more.
Or you could move in with me.
Did the music just get louder?
The crawl rolls on and Winston's got the rear!
- Let's go!
- Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Let's go with the backpack in the back of the pack.
Hey, so listen, can't make the crawl.
Bummed.
- What?
- But remember tomorrow we have that photo shoot, and I'm gonna need you to look as Mexican as possible, okay?
It's not okay.
We should be together.
It's Valentine's Day.
Come on, you don't really care about Valentine's Day, do you?
I don't know, maybe I do.
Plus, you owe me.
I ran the teleprompter at your last debate I made "Fawn is Fine" bumper stickers on my own dime.
- Yeah.
- Even krumped at that anti-gang initiative.
Yeah, I have mixed feelings about that.
- Me, too.
The point is, - Yeah.
I'm tired of always doing your things.
What do you want?
You want a You want a photo op?
Or do you want a boyfriend?
- Call me when you know what you want.
- Yeah, okay.
This bar completes the eyes on my smiley face.
Miller, man, it's just an honor to be on this bar crawl with you.
Just serving your vision.
Are you guys going on a bar crawl?
I just got dumped, so this holiday is really kicking me in the penis.
Me, too, man.
Me, too.
It's been a real kick in the gooch.
Not anymore, it's not.
'Cause you're joining us.
Valentine's Day might be for couples, but the crawl is for all.
Yes.
We just got our motto, folks.
The bar crawl is for all!
Good evening, happy Valentine's Day.
May I offer you a piece of my hear?
Hey.
You again.
I'm curious, d-do you actually think that's gonna work?
I mean, you tell me.
Are you trolling bars on Valentine's Day trying to find sad single girls to hook up with you?
I'm not gonna say yes, and I'm not gonna say no.
Because I know it would be a lie.
So yes.
I'm gonna - I'm gonna take these.
- Don't!
- Yep.
- Paid $3.50 for those.
You owe me $3.50.
I don't know, it's just such a huge step and so early in the relationship, and I thought that I could skip the question and come back to it later, which is the strategy I taught my S.A.T. prep course.
All right, let's do pros and cons.
Okay, pros I love him.
I love his house, I love his accent.
When he says "raccoon" he says it like "rac-coon".
- Adorable.
- Cons His toaster is super-old.
Ugh!
I tried to stay out of this, but move in with him!
Yeah, well, I-I want to move in with him, but No "but," there's no damn "but".
- No "but".
- But what if I blew it by pretending I didn't hear him?
Or maybe it wasn't that obvious.
Nah, she heard me, it was very obvious.
I really hate to see you upset.
You know, if I had something to g You know what, I do have something.
I have a bag of nuts in my bag.
Do you want a bag of nuts?
Maybe she didn't hear you.
- You know, she's got a lot of hair.
- Mm.
And hair blocks sound.
It happened when we were dating all the time.
Hey, did you get a chance to read my Walking Dead fan fiction, yet?
What'd you think?
Well, here's the good news, lad.
We have a solution.
It's God's gift to man.
- It's alcohol.
- I can't.
We agreed to pretend-drink so we could go out to dinner.
Are you saying that 'cause you want me - to go to jail for murder?
- No.
No, 'cause I'm gonna murder you if you're pretend-drinking on my bar crawl!
And you're breaking my heart!
You can't fight the crawl.
It's like fighting a hurricane.
You know what a hurricane is?
Do you guys have those over the pond?
We don't, but I know what it is.
- You guys don't have them?
- No.
- They're awful.
- Mm-hmm.
It's like fighting one of those.
And a hurricane doesn't have fists, so just, bang, you lose!
- Let's drink.
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah!
- USA!
- USA!
- Yeah!
- USA!
USA!
And also where you're from!
- Mmm.
- To show respect.
Well, happy V-Day to me.
Fawn and I are on the rocks.
By the way, a pun that would have killed at last week's geologist ball.
Let's murder her.
What?
!
I want chicken wings.
I know.
How many drinks you had tonight?
Nine plus three minus one.
Oh, no.
That's Because I'm gonna out-drink Miller.
You are gonna out-drink Miller?
No one out-drinks Miller.
- I do.
- I guarantee you, you don't.
You don't know me.
Cece, Nick just got dumped, okay?
He has a depth of anger and sadness that rests between his eyes, and he can drink forever and ever and ever.
You'll lose every time.
Hey, it's my business partner that I was telling you about Schmidt!
Schmidt!
- Nick, who are all these people?
- These are the crawlers.
The single, the lonely, the close-talkers, the shockingly pale, the stank-mouths, fat boys in the back The chubby-fronts, the delusionally-okay with themselves but no one is alone tonight because The crawl is for all!
The crawl is for all!
The crawl is for all!
I just want chicken wings.
Oh, you're hammered, Cece.
- Hey.
- Hey, Jess, I'm drinking fire.
- That seems dangerous.
- Mm Um, I wanted to talk to you about what you said before.
What did I say?
I can't remember.
You don't, you don't remember what you said?
No, I embraced the crawl.
Oh.

- Are you following me?
No, I'm not following you, dude.
Do you have any nicer, sluttier friends?
Yeah, I do, and I'm never introducing them to you.
- That's messed up.
- And they're real dirty.
- Aw!
- Can I have a gimlet, please?
- I.D.?
- Seriously?
Why?
'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.
Oh Ah.
- Thank you.
- You got a Kansas license.
That's where I learned to drive, and I have an emotional attachment to it, and I don't need to explain that to you.
No, you don't, but - You're from Kansas?
- Yup.
Well, I'm from all over.
Army brat.
Me, too.

- No.
- You ever live in Germany?
- Dusseldorf in '96!
Lived there in '97!
That's so weird.
So, we've, like, just missed each other for our entire lives.
And then we meet, like, three times in a row in one night.
Seems a little weird.
It's kind of like, uh - Fate?
- No.
- I know!
I can't believe I said that!
- Why did you say that?
- That's so cheesy.
- Oh, I hate that!
Hey, Coach!
- Coach!
- I don't know them.
I got a female condom if you need it, my man!
Don't hold this against me, please.
Oh, God Here, Cece, have some water.
No, thank you.
No.
Valentine's Day just sucks.
- I don't know.
I kind of like it.
- Since when?
Since a few years ago since three years ago, to be exact.
Oh, what happened three?
Oh.
It was when you first took a chance on me.
And we humped until the sun came out.
Did all the things that R. Kelly raps about.
Yeah, I know.
I was there.
It was the best night of my life, and ever since then, Valentine's Day has always been my favorite holiday, and I hope that you don't remember that I have said any of these things tomorrow.
Oh, it's gonna happen again.
It's gonna Oh.
It's gonna happen again.
- All right.
- Oh Somehow, this isn't repulsive.
It's not great, but it certainly isn't the worst.
I'm so sorry that I pretended not to hear you.
It's just that I wasn't ready for it, and sometimes you mumble with your accent, and I never fully understand you.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I asked you to move in with me out of the blue.
What kind of nutter does that?
The craziest mother nutter in the whole damn place!
Ryan Geauxinue, will you move in with me?
I have my own home.

Home base!
Barkeep, bring us beer.
If you call me barkeep one more time, I'm shutting this bitch down.
Mike, I love you because you're gay and 'cause you're dangerous.
I can't believe I used to have a crush on you.
Hey, man.
How's it going?
I'm not hooking up tonight.
I met one girl.
Several times.
She's pretty much perfect.
Nice.
Where's she at?
I ditched her, dude.
She's, like, relationship material.
That's not what I'm looking for tonight.
- Really?
- Yeah, I want something easy.
- Something easy?
- Like Sunday morning.
Like Sunday morning.
Know what I'm saying?
I know what you're saying.
That bitch is a Monday.
- Know what I'm saying?
- You know what's funny?
I got something just for that.
You're gonna love it.
Here it is.
- I can't wait.
- Give it to me right - Yo!
- Go get that girl, dude.
I don't even know where she is.
I didn't hit you that hard.
Hey.
This, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing?
Yeah.
Not to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.
And I would know.
I have their biography here in my backpack.
I care about Schmidt, but just as a friend, all right?
Look me in the eyes, and tell me you don't have feelings for Schmidt.
I don't have feelings for him.
Dude, you are nowhere near my eyes.
Nobody hit on me.
I'm taken.
Don't talk to me.
I'm a councilwoman.
Schmidt?
Did the whole crawl to find you.
I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm sober.
I'm wearing my strapless bra like a belt.
But I know what I want.
I want you.
I want you to be my boyfriend.
As much as a I want a commuter lane to Costa Mesa!
Vote Moscato!
- What?
- They're kissing.
I thought maybe you were gonna say something like, "No" or, like, "I miss him so much now".
Last call!
We got one more bar on the crawl!
We have to finish the smile!
You're never ever gonna make it.
And I'm never gonna ride a jet ski with Tom Colicchio on my back.
So, sometimes dreams just don't come true.
I'm sorry about that guy Galecky not hugging you from behind in the water on a motorized thing I'm sorry!
We will finish what we have started!
Yay!
We will feast on the spoils of this night for a thousand moons!
In the name of love and booze!
Oh, no.
My crush is back.
I hate myself.
Oh, this person will not stop texting me.
Where is it?
Sorry.
Oh, it's an e-mail from Wellington Prep.
You do realize we were just about to have sex, right?
Say something to get back in the mood say raccoon.
They're offering me the job of headmaster.
In England?
Raccoon?
- So, you'd be the headmaster?
- Headmaster.
- Of Wellington?
- Of Wellington.
Headmaster.
Jess look at me.
I'm not gonna take it.
Wellington's not even that great.
You have their current headmaster as your emergency contact.
Okay, it's heaven on Earth.
And I love it.
But I love you more.
Well, I love you, which is why I can't let you pass up this opportunity!
If we were ready to live in the same place, then we should be ready to live 5,000 miles apart.
- Yeah, I suppose, but - Well, I'll call you every night after work.
It'll only be, like, midnight your time.
I could learn to stay up late.
Maybe I should try cocaine!
- Yeah!
Or coffee!
- That, too.
And I'll come and visit.
It's only, like, an 11-hour flight.
And then a four-hour drive to Wellington.
That's so long!
Which is great 'cause I can catch up on podcasts.
We can do this!
We can do this long distance, right?
Right.
This is our revolution!
When I say bar, you say - Crawl!
- Bar!
Crawl!
Jess, are you guys coming or what?
Hi.
May!
May!
Hey.
- You again.
- Yeah.
Me again.
Look, um, I'm sorry about earlier.
I just, I-I really didn't plan on-on meeting somebody so great tonight, you know?
You messed everything up!
'Cause you're, like, awesome and that sucks because it's, like, that's not what I want.
And you're pretty, which is a bummer.
'Cause it's, like, damn!
She fine, but it's, like, at the same time, I'm, like, I don't need this in my life.
- You wear a leather jacket - I'm sorry.
Are you I'm just confused.
Are you trying to say something nice right now?
Yes.
I am.
And I'm terrible at it.
Is there any way I could get, I ca I, um I could get your number maybe?
Aw A long number.
What the hell is this?
Is this your e-mail address?
Write a good e-mail.
And I'll go out with you.
- What?
- I'm talking full sentences.
I'm talking no typos.
No pictures.
No pictures.
God, you are gonna make this really hard for me, huh?
Yes.
Aw You smell good.
Doug's Ale House!
The tip of the smile!
The crawl is complete!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
Get in!
- Hey!
- Hey.
Everything okay?
I'd spent a long time on the crawl, and now that it's over, it's just a natural sadness.
It's just gonna take a minute.
Just go on in.
It's fine.
What's the holdup?
Nick's cracking a little bit.
Everybody, relax, okay?
It's just the crawl's over.
Kai is over.
I got nothing to do.
That's it.
I'm not cracking.
I just have nothing to do.
Come on.
Of course, you have so much to do.
Nick we're business partners, man.
- We're teammates.
- You're smart and talented guy.
And tonight we found out that you have a weird, _ charisma.
You should make more maps man.
That's what you should do.
- You're my idea-man.
- Thank you guys.
Thank you for saying all this nice stuff.
I love you guys.
It's time to go inside.
We got a crawl to finish.
Yeah.
We got a crawl to finish.
Now out of my way, I'm getting another drink.
I can't let you in.
You're not wearing shoes.
Where are you shoes, Nick?
Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.
- Everybody's waiting for you.
- I can't go into the bar.
I don't have shoes on.
- Why don't you have shoes on, Nicholas?
- He threw them at a squirrel.
My map is just a deformed smile now.
I didn't complete it.
Or is it?
A goatee face.
- What bar is that?
- What bar is that?
I'm glad you asked.
Welcome to Winston's bar.
- Hot stuff!
- Aww!
Happy Valentine's day, everybody.
Like a black Mary Poppins.
That's right.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
The guys and I are about to leave for the airport, and I'm so excited to see you.
- Is that Ryan?
- I can't wait for you to see my hometown.
It's going to be just like An Affair to Remember, only instead of the Empire State Building on New Year's Eve, it's going to be a winery near the Portland airport at my dad's wedding.
Anyway, I love you, I miss you.
Hello?
Hello?
Sounds like I lost you for a minute!
Are you there?
!
Where's my widdle Eng-wish man?
And with that, Ryan walked into the River Thames and accepted death.
The joke's on you, 'cause I wasn't even talking to him.
I was leaving a voice mail.
Haven't talked to him for a week.
Are you guys making a group face?
- No, we're not - No.
- Nah.
- Guys, look, Ryan and I are great.
Really?
'Cause he doesn't call enough.
And when he does, it's in the middle of the night.
Ryan didn't want to move to England, he had to move to England.
For the last couple of weeks, you've been keeping Nick hours, and and it's ugly.
Hey.
Sorry.
I was talking to Ryan before he went to work and I must have fallen asleep.
Friend to friend, am I wearing pants?
The situation isn't ideal, however, long distance is super romantic.
Plus I don't have to shave my legs every day which is a real plus.
You know, Fawn shaves herself from toe to chin.
Every single day.
God, I love my girlfriend.
Hey.
Oh, Cece.
Yeah, what?
Huge news.
Jake Apex is coming to the wedding.
Jake Apex?
Who is Jake Apex?
Jake Apex is Cece's high school crush.
Never did anything for me, but turned Cece to soup.
- Thanks.
- Mm.
Yeah.
Is he one of them Portland hippies?
'Cause I hate them Portland hippies.
He is a legend.
Every time I spoke to him, I'd have a full-blown tiny kid stroke.
Hey, killer.
I d uh mm Yeah, well, I got a bad feeling about this guy.
Why, because he's bomb and Cece wants some?
No.
Other reasons.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go water my succulents.
How do you know Apex is so cute?
I just assumed.
Winston, stop with the look, okay?
Otherwise I will murder you and clean up your blood with your cat.
All right?
For the 50th time, I do not like Schmidt.
Good luck finding my cat.
You know, I haven't seen him in weeks.
My best man suit.
Oh.
I'm my dad's best man.
He wanted a boy.
My middle name's Christopher.
Yeah.
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage I can't stand it, I know you planned it I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate The Co-Pays are awesome.
I can't believe they're also pharmacists.
I'm-a Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle What could it be?
It's a mirage You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage.
That's really good.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
This is a nice place.
I mean, it's not the best vineyard in Portland.
- Here we go.
- That's Bartleby Cellars, of course.
How would you even know that?
Whenever Coach goes to a new city, he learns all about it, like a real weirdo.
I was an army brat, all right?
I moved a lot.
Assimilating was key.
Oh, and by the way, calling somebody weird in Portland is actually a compliment, so thank you, Nick.
Hey, oh.
It's just Oh.
Sorry, I thought I heard my phone ringing.
Ryan's supposed to call me before he gets on the plane.
- Oh!
Sorry.
- Jess, just take your phone out.
No, Nick, I want to be here with you guys.
I want to Sorry.
I just want to Sorry.
Does anybody else hear buzzing?
- No.
- No, 'cause it's not buzzing.
No, honey, but, you know, he's going to be here soon, okay?
Yeah.
Are you guys still touring the city?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I made about 12 drafts of this map.
Couldn't figure out where to go.
Had to fit 18 years into one morning.
So, here it is.
Aw.
I'm so excited to show him Portland, and my mom is so excited to meet him.
And I'm going to show him - Jess, it's not buzzing.
- It's not buzzing.
- I promise you it's not.
- It's not buzzing.
- Oh, there's my dad.
- Hey, guys.
Sounded great.
You sounded great.
You look terrific, too.
Hey!
- Oh, there's my daughter.
- Oh I thought we talked about you not calling me that.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, how's the food?
I haven't eaten in three weeks.
Trying to fit into my wedding dress.
Had a dream about a crouton last night.
And, um And that was the whole dream.
Ooh, before I forget, best man.
Aw.
The wedding rings.
Hey, I want you to meet a bunch of relatives that are all going to be dead in a couple of years.
- Oh, good idea.
- Oh.
Hey, what happened to the British guy?
He's coming tomorrow.
Hey, Jake.
Jake Apex.
That's him.
That's him right there.
I will say one thing about that man that I've only said about Ryan Gosling hot damn!
What's up, Winston?
I'm gonna just go I'm gonna go talk to him, yeah.
- You're good.
- Yup.
- You're okay.
- Gonna I didn't know that was a thing.
You Okay.
Oh, this is very hard to watch.
It's like when Bob Costas had that eye infection at the O-Lympics.
You mean the Olympics.
Okay.
Oh, God.
Okay, what happened?
Did I look cool?
- Uh - Define "cool".
What happened?
I don't know what hap I blacked out.
Okay, look, Cece I'm gonna help you.
I'm Usher, you're Bieber.
And Jake Apex is all the hot tracks that we're going to make together.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, um Ryan's not coming.
Oh, boy.
He has to work on Monday and he thought, ultimately, it didn't make sense, which makes sense.
It's not a big deal.
But the tour's canceled.
: Hey, Randy, the tour's canceled.
: I don't know why I did that.
Anyway, go ahead, Nick.
Go ahead.
Talk about how much this sucks.
Tell me that Ryan's not coming 'cause he's a blank who's a blank.
I do have one thing to say.
While you were away, we were all talking about how much we wanted to go on the tour.
So don't cancel it.
We'll do it with you!
- Really?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Yes!
Really?
- Yes!
- Fired up.
- We haven't stopped talking about - Yeah, man.
Couldn't be more excited.
All 18 places!
- There's 18?
- Wow.
I'm going to add a few more stops, then.
I definitely know you'd enjoy the Shakespeare Garden.
Ha-ha, great.
Guys, Jess says she's fine, but I know she's not.
Okay?
She needs cheering up.
We're in her hometown.
I can't believe Ryan bailed.
I'm not happy with what Ryan's doing.
It's, it's not cool.
But today, it's all sunshine and smiles.
Hey, hey, hey, hey Let me, let me get sunshine.
Let me get sunshine.
Okay, yeah, you can be sunshine.
Yes!
Here she is Sunshine and smiles!
- Jess!
- Sending the sun in!
Hi.
So I'm sorry this is so small.
It was just meant for Ryan and me.
- No worries.
- No problem.
- It's great.
Your shoes look super-cute.
- You look great.
- You look great.
- Let's see if Ryan - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Give me that purse!
No more checking in with Ryan.
The tour starts now.
And there's the Italian soda shop where I first learning what a "not" joke was.
Not!
I I learned it, actually, in the candle shop, next-door.
People don't really do "not" jokes anymore.
Not!
They'll be in forever!
- Right, guys?
- Not!
And there's the dance studio where I had my first kiss with the cutest/only boy in my jazz troupe.
Then he came out of the closet super gay.
Then we kissed some more.
Then he went to Oberlin.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop in that store!
I'm going full Portland, people.
I'm so Portland right now, they all staring at me like, "Is that the president of Portland"?
I'm like, "No".
This is the very pizza place where we'd dab our pizzas with our napkins, to get the grease off, and then we'd make this kid named Joey eat the napkins.
I'm not gonna lie I'm Joey.
Hmm.
: Oh, my God.
Oh, no, he's here.
He's here.
He just walked in.
Oh, is he a firefighter?
Seems pretty easy in Portland, huh?
Rain just does the work for you.
Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
No!
Do do not go and talk to him.
Do not go and talk to him.
Cece, not everything's about you, you narcissist.
All right, just go to the bathroom, like you said you'd And he's talking to him.
Just don't look.
Just don't look.
Oh, well, he's looking at you.
- What?
What?
Really?
- No, like, right now, he's staring at you.
Don't, don't, don't, don't look, don't look.
Don't look.
The cutest one's looking right at me.
I don't see a "cute" or "not cute" one, Coach.
If you had to choose, which one's the cutest?
Way to the left.
: I'm super nervous.
Now my hands are sweating.
Then wipe 'em off.
If he comes over and shakes your hand, - you don't want sweaty hands.
- Oh, my God!
He said he thinks you're cute.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Hey, Nick, can I have my phone?
You know what?
Never mind.
I don't care.
So this is my childhood home, the place of my birth.
Thank you guys so much for doing this, and coming on this tour with me.
I forgot all about Hello, hello, hello, darling!
Where's the famous Mr. Geauxinue?
Um well actually, um, Ryan had to cancel last-minute, so he's not coming.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, honey that's just awful.
Aw Damn men.
Oh, I feel so bad for you.
Hey, Mom Mom Oh, honey Um don't get emotional, okay?
'Cause if you get emotional, I'll get emotional.
Let's talk about happy stuff.
Did you guys see the video of the panda farting and falling of a branch?
- Pretty crazy, man.
- It was funny.
It was funny.
It made me laugh.
Who wants scramblies?
You know I do, Mom.
: Good.
Look, this might not be the right time to say this, you guys, but, uh, should we take a straw poll on this whole Cosby thing?
I just want to clarify to everyone here that I am fine.
Which is why I'm fine.
- Great!
- Yeah.
- Finer than fine.
- Mm-hmm.
- Which is why I'm fine.
- Fantastic!
- I'm fine, too.
Everybody's great.
- Perfect.
I'm not fine!
I can't do this anymore.
It's not all smiles and sunshine.
It's not!
Look, Ryan bailed and that's a dick move.
And that's the truth.
: I'm fine, I'm just gonna go to my room.
: I made scones.
Was that sunshine or smiles?
Hmm?
Oh Joanie I don't want to lie to you, so I'm not There's shells all in these eggs.
So, Joan, how do you, uh, feel about Bob getting remarried?
Mm!
Oh, I'm fine.
I just feel bad for Ashley.
I mean, let's just say he's a man with a healthy appetite, except one thing.
Well, that's a visual.
I don't really have a burning desire to stick around for the wedding, so I'm going on a trip - with some friends.
- Hmm!
A trip I've never taken before.
Hmm!
Hey!
You mind if I turn this down?
"AP Stat Jams".
Advanced Placement.
Very smart.
How many Lilith Fairs did you go to?
Oh, Method Man performed at that one?
It's Liliths Fair.
Like "passersby" or "attorneys general".
Well, look, I came to, uh give you this.
Text Ryan as much as you want, it's none of my business.
I just think long-distance relationships suck.
I once broke up with a woman who lived in Irvine, and that's only 30 minutes away.
Mind you, I had hornets living in my car at the time, which was a factor, but the commute was also a big part of it.
Well, look, Nick, we're different, and just because it's difficult with Ryan, doesn't mean we're doomed.
We're star-crossed lovers.
We're like Kate and Leo or Claire and Leo, or whatever blonde Leo is taking on boats.
They're all doomed.
Leo ain't gonna settle down He ain't ready.
I'm a hopeless romantic, and I always have been.
Which is why I mean, it's a nice notion, it's just from 1994 to 2001, I believed that Jordan Catalano was gonna show up in my driveway after a dirt bike accident, all scruffy and beautiful and he would need a bath and some medical attention.
You think that little boy is driving a dirt bike?
He looks a lot like you.
That's me, that's Jordan Catalano.
I honestly couldn't tell the difference.
I swear to God.
I'm not trying to be mean.
You know what the problem with Jordan Catalano is?
Yeah an undiagnosed learning disability.
Oh, I didn't know the boy had mental problems I wouldn't be teasing him, but No, it's that he's fake.
The only thing that matters is if the guy is there for you when you need him.
Otherwise, you're dating a wall.
I have to get to my dad's wedding.
I didn't I didn't come in here trying to be harsh, I'm ju I was trying to be helpful and it's not working and I apologize.
I was coming in as a friend, Je I'm sure that's just her.
Well, the dream's dead.
Apparently, Jake Apex has to work, so he's not gonna come to the wedding.
I'm wearing the craziest underwear for nothing.
Okay, look, Cece, you know what we do?
We regroup.
No, it's fine, Schmidt.
I'm over it.
It is not fine.
Look, Cece, you're the most amazing woman I ever met.
If you want Jake Apex, I'm gonna help you get Jake Apex.
I'm never gonna stop trying to make you happy, Cece.
I promise you, for the rest of my Oh, look at that, it's Fawn.
Hello, Councilwoman Moscato.
: Oh, yeah.
: Guys!
I forgot the rings at the house.
They're in my purse in my room.
And now I have to go get my dad ready.
Apparently, he's wearing some kind of a male corset.
All right, Coach and I will get the rings You don't have a car.
All right.
Okay.
Wait!
All right.
Let's do this.
: Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay, ready?
- Yep, yep.
Go easy.
I'm not on!
- You're not?
!
- I'm not on!
I'm not on!
You don't have the rings?
!
- Well, Dad, hold on - You don't have the rings?
!
Oh!
Damn it, no!
That's No, this is bad.
We're doomed!
You look beautiful, but we are doomed.
Oh, yeah.
I wish these were filled with ground beef.
Oh, wait, this is Nick!
Nick's calling!
He's probably walking in the door.
Here.
Hey.
I found the purse, but your mom has the rings.
What?
Can you ask her for them?
Yeah, it's a little hard right now.
Remember she said she was going on a trip?
It's gonna be a hair longer.
It's acid, isn't it?
What is taking them so long?
: Hi!
Um so the wedding will begin shortly.
But first, I'm gonna start you off with a crowd-pleasing, nondenominational Something in it for everyone "Ave Maria".
Ah Ve Joan, I need you to focus.
I need you to help me find those rings.
We have the rings.
They all all of you We all have the rings.
Everyone's got the ring.
Come into the womb.
- Come into the womb.
- I don't want to come in the womb.
- Come into the womb.
- I'm not a womb guy!
I'm not a womb guy!
Mari - Show me the rings!
- The womb.
Reverse.
Birth.
Can I just see that?
Reverse.
Birth.
That's not it.
Ah Ah - Reverse.
Birth.
- Here we go!
This is a real Portland experience!
Ah, hippie hair in my mouth!
Hippie hair in my mouth!
And with that message from Beaker, all of the Muppets have wished Bob and Ashley a very happy wedding.
: Except for me.
: Cookie Monster, is that you?
Now, I understand, Cookie Monster, you've got a very special song to sing for us.
: Yes, I do!
Ah Ve Mari There are a lot of ways to stall a wedding, okay?
And you just happened to Go talk to him.
Yeah.
Talk to the guy you like.
Hey, killer.
Hey, so, uh I'd love to see you again before you leave.
To be honest with you, Cece, I've always had a crush on you.
Oh, God.
Okay, so I've never said this out loud before, but I'm in love with someone else.
It's kind of complicated because he has a girlfriend, so I can't tell anybody.
I mean, Winston knows, but you, you don't know Winston.
I got to get back to the truck soon.
Power steering's out again.
I'm the only one strong enough to drive it.
- Of course.
- But, uh, I guess I'll see you around.
Yeah, I guess.
- Okay, okay.
- Got it.
Oh, my God!
Thank God you guys are here!
Is my mom okay?
It's actually really hard riding one of these bikes; it's super tiring.
I don't have a watch on.
I don't know why I'm doing that.
Dad, I Aren't they cute?
Cute as a mute.
That's a thing.
People-people say that.
Love is never what you think it's gonna be, is it?
No, it isn't.
Hey, Nick you were right.
He should've been here.
I need a guy who shows up.
'Cause anything else just isn't real.
Jess, you should, uh, know something, too.
I touched both your mother's breasts in a communal womb earlier today.
I didn't do it on purpose, but there it is.
Thanks for telling me.
I appreciate it.
It's a relief to get it off my shoulders.
Thanks for being cool about it.
I'll leave you alone.
Wait, what?
I didn't read about this place.
That's because it's not in any guidebook, Tagliaboo.
It is called Crush Pond.
At least that's what Jess and I used to call it.
We used to come down here when she liked somebody.
We'd throw a rock in the pond, and we'd wish that they liked her back.
- Huh.
- I'd sit over there and smoke cloves while she did that.
I broke up with Ryan.
- Wow.
- Oh, babe, I'm sorry.
How'd he take it?
Actually, pretty good.
- So you got his voice mail.
- Yeah.
Sounds about right.
Last stop on the tour.
Um it's Crush Pond.
So say a name in your head and throw the rock in the pond, and they'll love you forever.
Um, and for the record, that's actually never worked.
So we're gonna do it anyways?
Yeah.
We're really gonna do this?
I got a big one.
: I know who your rock is for.
Winston, you better shut up before I knock that fade right off your head.
: You don't know me like that, Cece.
I swear - Oh, I know you like that, trust me.
- Swear to God Uh, I'm gonna say Detroit Pistons.
You're not getting it, man.
What-what is it?
You got to say, like, a lady's name.
Oh.
Gladys.
- A lady you know.
- Oh.
To whoever you are, can't wait to meet you.
And I hope you live close by.
Three, two, one.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
All right, clockwise, honey.
Don't fight it.
Let me make you.
What is that?
This is the only thing us Miller men know how to make.
And we call it The Sauce.
- It stinks.
- It doesn't stink.
Fawn is coming over for a midnight fondue supper.
There's no chocolate or cheese on this earth that makes a cube of bread pop like The Sauce.
Your girlfriend's coming over for the first time, and you asked Nick to cook?
True, normally food Ã  la Nick would be less appealing to me than licking the floor of a beach bathroom.
But I want Fawn to have the best, and The Sauce is the best.
Good for you when you said "Fawn" and then "fondue," I definitely thought you were headed in the direction of Step one: fondue.
- Step two: do Fawn.
- That's not bad.
Yeah, I was, like, "Fondue is Fawn done".
Th-These are all good.
Hey, has anybody heard for Cece?
'Cause she hasn't answered any of my texts, and I'm starting to get worried.
Jess is starting to find your behavior "suspicious".
That's a police word.
It's not a police word, Winston.
It's a very common word.
And you know why I'm keeping my distance.
I like Schmidt.
For the second time!
I know how many times.
Ah.
Ah.
If you could see my face right now, I'm smiling, and I'm saying, "Ah".
And if Jess finds out, she's gonna want to get involved, and I don't want her involved because there's nothing that she can do.
Look, if you act suspicious, then she's gonna be suspicious, all right?
Look, don't slink your head in the dumps.
You got to raise your hand with the sunshine wh-where people walk, you know?
Because that's what the whole point of the when the if you can lead 'em to water, but you can't make a sound, right?
Look, just call her.
Fine, okay, I'll call her.
But and listen to me, she cannot find out.
Under no circumstance.
Okay, baby.
Look, your secret is safe with me.
That being said, - I am not a smooth man.
- Yeah, I get that.
Did I do something to piss Cece off?
Oh, Schmidt, you have something on your pants.
Ah!
It's a spider!
Jess, why did you do that?
You know how he gets He turns into a cartoon elephant of yesteryear who just saw a mouse.
Which is offensive in present day 'cause it seems like a gay stereotype they tried to sneak by us.
"Where's my balance ball?
There's a mouse loose in the house".
Where is it?
We've got to hunt it down.
- We got to have a spiderhunt.
- We're not having one of those.
- No, dude, no more spiderhunts.
- Guys, they're all over me!
This is childish, and you need to get over it.
Jess, would you please?
You know this fear comes from a very real place 1999.
American Pie was sweeping the nation.
And everybody was doing it with pies.
I just happened to accidentally fall asleep right afterwards.
And when I awoke, the dried apple filling was it just had attracted so many spiders, and they were all over it, and I Okay, everyone was doing it with pies?
Well, Y2K was an uncertain time.
- I don't know "everyone," Jess.
- I might have dabbled.
- Fawn can't see me like this.
- Fawn won't care.
- Jess, I'm embarrassed for her to see me in this state.
- You're fine - It's embarrassing just a little spider!
- You're fine.
And there it is!
I just saw it!
- Get off the table.
- We'll do the spiderhunt.
- Fawn can't see you like this.
- There it is!
It's right there It's licking it's lips.
- So I'm finally e-mailing that girl, May.
- Nice.
- Here's what I got so far.
- Mm-hmm.
"Dear May.
Lay down on me".
Well, th-then what?
You met this woman weeks ago I can't believe you haven't e-mailed her.
Just text her.
If I had her number, I would text her.
She gave me her e-mail.
And now I have to write how I feel.
Which is weird, it's like I-I like her.
Much.
You like her much?
All right.
"Girl, it's warm today.
"Yesterday was warm, too.
Yeah".
Yeah, I'm gonna write, "Yeah".
You're happy about this?
Damn it, no, it doesn't feel right.
Yeah, just hold it down, hold it down.
Okay, you guys know the drill.
We split up into teams, and we hunt this spider.
- Why can't we just call an exterminator?
- Yes.
They've all blocked Schmidt's calls since the dandelion incident.
It moved like a spider, Nick!
I don't know a Cece.
Yeah, I do.
How the hell are you?
Jess, please, hurry up, we're on a hunt!
It could be right above our heads right now.
Hanging from its butt-rope.
Come over.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Did I do something?
Are we in another purse thing that I don't know about?
No, no, Jess, of course it's not you.
It would just be an honor.
I'll be right there.
Great, wear shoes that you don't mind getting spider guts on.
Bye.
So what's going on with Cece?
Well, I had to beg her like a nerd, but she's finally coming over.
- Oh, she's coming over.
- Yeah.
- Good, man.
- Took a lot of cajoling.
- That's cool.
- Normally, it's, like, she'll come over all the time.
But now it's diff I don't know why that would be the case at all, but that's cool I respect the decision for her to come over.
Why are you acting weird?
I'm acting weird?
- Mm.
- Do you know something?
Do?
You I'm not a smooth man.
Is she mad at someone?
Ah no.
No.
No, she's not mad at anyone.
It's the opposite.
Mm.
- It's the opposite?
- That's not what I said.
You said, "No, no, she's not mad at anyone.
It's the opposite".
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
"Cheese is bad e'ryone.
Let's stop and spit".
The opposite of mad is Does she like someone?
What would make you assume that would be?
I can hear it.
I can hear it building its house.
Building its sticky, deadly house that you can never leave.
Building it.
With its ass.
- We're breaking up into two-person teams.
- Cece.
Each team has one Smusher and one Jar-Man.
Nick, I'm gonna make you a Smusher since you have to stir.
Hey, am I stirring right now?
Or is my arm still, and the world is stirring?
Coach, you're a Jar-Man.
- Mm.
- You're with Schmidt.
Cece, with your delicate little hands, you're a born Jar-Man.
- Okay.
- Which means I need to pair you up with a Smusher.
- I smush.
- That'd be me.
- Smusher for life.
- You're such a Jar-Man.
You don't even know you're a Jar-Man, Jar-Man.
- Yeah, you are.
- You're a born J-man.
Come on, Winston.
- Uh, Cece.
- Yeah.
Before we get started, you want to have a quick Jar-Man strategy session?
A little Jar-Jar strat sesh?
Are you winking or farting?
The only strategy is find the spider, kill the spider, mount the spider's head on top of the roof so all the other spiders know.
All right.
And spiderhunt!
- Spiderhunt!
- Spiderhunt!
You find that thing - you-you make sure that it's done.
- That's the plan, that's Okay.
Hey, what do you think Jess and Cece are talking about?
Oh, probably that stupid movie theater popcorn machine that Cece wants me to get for the bar.
She keeps haranguing me about it.
"Popcorn machine, popcorn machine".
Look, I don't know what void Cece's trying to fill in her life I don't know, either.
Why would I know?
You know, I don't know what void she's trying to fill.
- It's all she wants to talk about.
- Oh.
Stupid movie theater popcorn machine.
I'm like, "Shut up, dude".
You put bologna in your Bolognese?
Where else would it get its name?
Trick question it gets it from the mayonnaise.
Yeah, yeah.
You got it.
Do you think a good subject line is, "The Inside of You"?
Hey, you know, I bet I could spot this spider a lot better if I was on your shoulders.
Do not ask me again to get on my shoulders.
That's a once-a-year thing, and you already used it on Halloween, when we were ten-foot-tall Ralph Macchio.
Ow!
Damn it!
That was cool.
I didn't like that.
I could feel your genitals on the back of my neck like an airplane pillow.
Okay, you know what?
How about this?
I'm not sure why he did it but I sure am glad that God rearranged the letters in yam to create something even sweeter.
- What?
- May.
Oh, May, yeah.
Yeah, all right.
Keep going, keep going.
Oh, dear God.
It's left the web to feed.
All right, I'll put that.
Seems like a weird thing to say.
Lots of bars have popcorn machines.
I really think that people would dig it.
They're not that expensive.
And everybody loves fresh popcorn.
Do you like somebody in the loft?
Winston.
Okay, what did he tell you?
He told me you like someone but he won't name names.
Is it Schmidt?
Do you like Schmidt again?
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Absolutely not.
No.
Who is it then?
Who?
I want to tell you.
I want to tell you so, like, so badly You know me I want to tell you so bad, I just, um, I'm very sorry, but I can't.
Right, right, right, right, you can't tell anybody except freaking Winston!
That slow puzzler!
I know.
I'm lower down on the food chain - No!
- Than Officer Cat Fancy?
!
No.
No, no, no, no.
It's just I know that you would do anything to help me, and in this situation, you know, there's just nothing to be done.
And we both know that you would just want to get involved.
Well, I can stay uninvolved.
I want to tell you, but I can't.
I just can't.
Okay.
That's fine.
Okay.
That's cool, that's cool.
New teams!
You have to tell me who she likes.
There are no secrets between Jar-Man and Smusher.
Please!
She's my best friend.
You have to tell me.
Okay.
Look, Jess she likes me.
It's me she wants.
Not even for a second.
- I thought I was convincing.
- Yeah.
I need you to close your eyes and taste it.
Okay.
Oh Oh, Nick It's legit terrible.
Well, you taste for texture not taste you big old Not really what I was looking for at this stage.
Definitely affects my confidence.
Wait.
Wait!
The only person that Cece could like that she wouldn't want to tell me about is Nick!
Uh Does Cece like Nick?
Does Cece like?
Oh, my No you guessed it.
How you did that?
Oh, my God.
My ex-boyfriend and my best friend?
I feel like Brenda when Kelly dated Dylan!
Or the other way around.
Now I know those are the characters from the original 90210.
But that's about my ceiling.
Dylan was his nickname the Peach Pit?
'Cause I remember I remember that being a whole thing.
I'm sorry, I'm a little wound up.
You should be wound up because the Peach Pit used to be yours, but now Brenda want a slice.
Everybody trying to get a slice of that Peach Pit.
You have every right to be mad, Jess, but just do it quietly.
You know, just do it on the low, do it in here.
brought up the popcorn machine.
Yeah, well, I guess I'm just gonna have to drop it.
You know, even Jess didn't want to hear about it, and she'll listen to Schmidt discussing Andy Cohen discussing Bethenny discussing NeNe.
Well, great, I'm glad that's behind us.
Yeah.
Now let's never speak of popcorn machines again.
Cece and Nick?
Cece likes Nick?
Cece likes Nick?
!
I mean, I guess I understand it 'cause they're at the bar together and once you start sharing tips, - where does the sharing end?
- Look Jess, it's not that big of a deal.
Because we all just cats and dogs at the end of the day.
What about Schmidt?
Schmidt's Nick's best friend, and Schmidt and Cece have a history.
Look at the memory on you.
- I'm gonna have to help Schmidt through this.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look, Jess, you can't talk to Schmidt about Cece liking Nick.
- Come on.
- No, you're right.
I have to talk to Cece first.
Right, you got to talk to Ce No, wait, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Jess, you can't talk to Cece because Cece, you know, and Nick, they just won't work.
'Cause I was talking to Nick.
He said, "Winston".
I was like, "What's up, Nick"?
He said What?
He said she ugly.
He said what?
!
Yeah, he said she look like a dang ol' meatball with hair.
New teams!
You know who's great?
Cece.
One of our finest.
Lovely woman.
And she has so much to offer.
Is that what this is about?
She sends you to sell me on it?
No, Nick.
She doesn't know I'm talking to you at all.
Wait.
You guys have talked about it?
All the time.
But I thought she and I had come to a decision.
- Which is?
- It's not happening.
Well, why not?
'Cause I'm not interested.
And I know it's not cool to say, but I don't like the way it would look.
People are gonna say what they're gonna say.
They're not reasons - not to go through with it.
- Fine.
You want to know my biggest concern?
My biggest concern is the smell.
The smell?
The smell of it.
Yeah, and it's not Cece's fault.
I mean, they all smell.
I've told her that.
- You told Cece you think all women - Don't make this - a feminist thing - It I'm not making it a feminist thing.
How?
They smell terrible.
It's common knowledge.
I thought your biggest concern would be how it affected the people around you.
- I mean, sure, a bunch of old drunks will grab at it - But if your biggest concern is the smell, I'm sure that's highly manageable.
Yeah, I guess there's, like, special solvents and soaps.
I-I haven't read up on it that much.
You know, but you got to really get in there and scrub it out.
It's disgusting.
You know, 'cause of the daily wear and tear and oil and grease just cooking in there.
It's enough to make a man barf thinking about it.
I mean, they get really hot.
- I know what temperature it gets.
- Hot..
But if I'm being honest, you know And I haven't talked to her about this but I do have good memories associated with the smell.
Ball games, the circus, hanging with my dad.
Listen here, you idiot.
I've known Cece a very long time, and I can promise you - the smell will not be a problem.
- That's really easy for you to say 'cause you're not the one who's gonna have to remind her to clean it all the time.
I promise you, if it becomes a problem - I will remind her.
- Well, if you remind her and she doesn't do it, I don't want you sneaking around and cleaning it yourself.
Nick.
I'm a good friend, but I am not that good of a friend.
"that a dream house is a house, but a dreamboat is a person".
I mean, it does speak to the soul.
Hey, what are these?
I've always wondered.
- Those are grapes.
- Uh, they're our glass grapes, bro.
- Grapes?
- Brings the whole, like, room together.
What the hell they doing in the loft?
Cece, um, do ladies have loins?
You know, it's like I've never looked around this house before.
Skimboards, a boxing glove.
Who in this loft has been to a single Coachella, let alone six of them?
Don't tell Cece that we talked.
She doesn't want me getting involved.
Of course she does, she just didn't think you were into the idea, okay?
She really values your opinion.
What if you guys had a r a r-real talk?
You know, outside of the bar.
All right.
We'll talk, just the two of us, outside the bar.
I'm proud of you, Nick.
Just make sure she makes her case about facts and figures.
And no more of this, "Come on, Nick, it tastes so yummy" crap.
New teams!
I want to do something freaky to you No one can resist my "Get Frisky" playlist, guys.
Just give in.
Give in.
I support it.
"To whom it may concern".
- That's good.
- I like that.
Wait a minute, is your e-mail address owwMeSoErnie@coolidge?
- Still?
- Yeah, man.
Picked it in college.
It's just gonna follow me from job to job, ISP to ISP.
We've been everywhere together, brotha.
- Never done .org or a .gov.
- Oh.
- I would never do that.
- Right.
But every other damn domain.
You can't e-mail a girl like May from an e-mail address like owwMeSoErnie.
Although, you did got a job at a school, so, what do I know?
I must really like this girl, huh?
Okay, it says here, we need "a murder of peppercorn," and a and "some of that flat Jew bread"?
Miller family!
Murder is over there.
it could be something really beautiful, and you-you won't know unless you try.
Okay!
Jess!
You don't have to trap me in your room.
We will, on a trial basis, rent a popcorn machine.
Okay?
Something's wrong with my Sauce.
My Sauce!
Hey.
Hey.
- You?
- I With him?
Winston.
Wh-Where'd it go?
How long has this been unstirred?
!
Is it 40 or 45?
Spider!
- Schmidt!
Schmidt!
- Whoa!
- Come on, man!
- No!
Aah!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hey, it's gone.
- Get him!
It's gone.
It's gone.
It's gone.
It can't hurt you.
- It can't hurt you.
- Where is where is the body?
!
He was headed straight for The Sauce!
Can you imagine how powerful that spider would've become had he entered my Sauce?
- Did I break it?
- You sent all 15 drafts of my e-mail to May.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.
Way I see it, we got two options.
All right, well, what are the two options, man?
I mean, you know, just, you got to just dive in, you know?
No, you don't have any options.
I don't have any options.
- Sometimes you don't have to talk.
- I'm really sorry, Coach.
I-I'll make it up to you.
But the good news is, is we got that spider, huh?
Don't have to worry about that thing anymore.
What?
What are you guys trying to tell me?
So, it is Schmidt?
Yeah.
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but - No, it's okay.
It's okay.
Look, I promise I won't tell him.
- Nobody's gonna tell him.
- Okay.
Hey, somebody tell him.
You tell him, but easy.
- Tell him.
I don't want to tell him, dude.
You tell him.
We're all his best friends.
Tell him.
I think I'm pretty good with it now.
Hey, Schmidt, I - I mean, spiders and all.
- Tell him!
I don't want to tell him.
Somebody just tell him!
Guys, just tell me.
- You're being so dramatic right now.
- You have a spider on your face.
What are you talking about?
I touched it!
- Get it off!
- Okay.
- Oh!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
Get it off!
Get it off of me!
Get it away from me!
Get it off!
- Get it off!
- Hey, hey, the spider.
Get it off!
Don't touch!
- Hello.
- Don't touch!
Get it off of me!
Get it!
Schmidt.
- Hold still.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Oh!
- Oh Ah!
What's up now, spider?
Vote Moscato!
Well, it can't hear you.
But, seriously, vote Moscato.
So, that guy, huh?
Yeah.
Can you blame me?
He's perfect.
- And when is dinner?
- Is it, um?
- The Sauce!
Sauce.
- The Sauce.
- Yeah.
'Cause Fawn's hungry.
My e-mails.
I'm about to pick you up with a tissue like you wouldn't believe!
So, what's the plan?
Jess.
I'm gonna pick you up with a tissue so hard!
He's happy.
He has a girlfriend.
Yeah, spi-spider!
I know, but it's you, and Fawn kind of scares me.
Let this be a warning to all your other little, uh, spider friends hiding out, too.
I know that would do anything for anybody, but right now, I just need you to be there for me and hold my hand, okay?
That's all.
Little half-insects, half-lobsters.
Ah I really want to do something.
Don't go up the spout if you can't handle the rain, s-spider!
Okay, well, you've done it.
The perfect burn of the dead bug.
- Yeah, that's right.
- Now stop.
: Okay.
The Sauce is shockingly great.
This tastes like the inside of a bear, and that is a compliment, my friend.
All right.
I Oh.
Oh.
May responded to my e-mails.
"I appreciate how much effort you put into these.
I'd love to go out".
- Hey.
- Great.
All right.
- There you go.
- Yeah!
Uh, you're welcome.
This is great guys, right?
- To Fawn.
- Oh.
A woman who likes me not in spite, but because of my flaws.
I do like you.
But I hate your flaws.
And to all my friends.
In the spiderhunt of life I sure am glad that we're a team of six.
- Cheers!
- Hey!
Hey!
To those who Okay.
No, that's good.
- And thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
All right, here we go.
- Ow.
- Oh.
Yeah, sweep the leg, Johnny.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Your hair cos Ù different.
Well, get used boys, because we are single, we are sophisticated and have just been to a place - to make us do the fold.
- What is the "fold"?
Do you know how impossible get great hair alone?
- No.
- You know the hair of those who admire?
Jesus.
Dude, her hair are ignored for that story of miracles.
There is a place that you just fold the hair?
Well, before you wash them.
Essentially first create a problem and then they charge you to fix it.
Here's an idea for a new turnover.
What about if you deadlift heels from shoes and then I'll pay for re-glue?
Or take your aching back and fix it.
Which would make me just a chiropractor.
You girls have to be very careful, the fold can give to a woman too much security and finds himself in situations older than she.
Hillary Clinton.
Hey, Ken, can you put the beer behind the counter.
Actually I had come to talk with these beautiful girls.
Beautiful hair.
Hey, Jess.
Hey, Cece.
Zamporso, hello.
I would give my hand, but it is moist.
- Still talking in people's faces.
- In my building there is internet, now.
- You've become even more pretty?
- What?
No.
What?
No.
What?
- No.
- You and Cece should come to a party with us tonight.
Live with Ken, Ken played football in college.
Show him, Ken!
Just kidding, Ken, no one wants to see that stuff.
In any case, there will be people really pussies , - know two architects twins.
- S Ù, are - Brothers.
- Ken, of what we talked about?
Some people understand things that do not are just natural for your brain.
Stupid idiot, does' talk me.
So, you want to come?
- Can you excuse me for a moment?
- S Ù.
Thou hast played terrible, stupid idiot.
Cece, I know I'm weird, but at parties there are cute guys who are not Schmidt.
That said Charisma, while you wash your hair?
What worried about Taylor Swift who lived in New York all alone.
Sure, we all are, but he also said that we must embrace our freedom.
We are single, we can do what we want!
The only thing that stops us is us, Charisma and made us promise not to waste these put into the crease.
- Our hair looks fabulous.
- Let'S Do It!
We go to this party!
Let's see where it takes us this trip!
Good morning.
Hello.
Wanna hear a funny story?
This green pillow here I always put me between the legs, as if there was someone to sleep with me.
But it has found its rightful home under your head, now.

Coach!
Come here, we're looking at video of Italian falling.
E 'to run with May, you know, I believe I have found the right one.
It seems we do not even kissed.
If it is true, what were those noises in their room?
It 'strange.
Just listen in to the rooms of others noises to try sex, Winston!
- Listen, if I do not do, - Hey.
Hey.
- At least I make sure others do.
- Winston, I'm serious.
Good morning!
- I guess you know all of May.
- Hello There.
If you want to exchange amenities, Please, do it now, because it's going to go.
Why are you talking as if I smoked and I were your father?
I'm sorry I could not stay, but sound at a charity event today sound suite number And the only thing left for me to learn is the passage of cadence, then - Well, at least not a sarabande.
- No, my God, I know!
True?
S Ù, I get it.
E 'crazy.
Hey, why do not you come too?
S Ù, is in an art gallery.
S Ù, s Ù, I think I speak on behalf of all, saying "absolument".
There is something too strong in Italian ending butt on the ground, man.
- My God!
My God!
- My God!
- My God!
My God!
My God!
- My God!
My God!
My God!
You have stickers on the neck.
"The man and the legend"?

I had no choice, is sleeping on my shirt.
We have to go!
- Walk of Shame!
Let'S Go!
- Hang on.
Why for women there is a specific name, for when they return home in the morning, while for men it is simply go home?
Chiamiamoci for who we are.
Two respectable women running towards the car.
Fantastico.
The sun!
Fire of Hell!

- Mine too is dead.
- I do not have cash.
- What do we do now?
We walk?
- My feet are a mess.
Okay?
And go around with shoes in hand is the authentic walk of shame.
Please stop saying " walk of shame".
Even "authentic".
Not even that word makes me mad.
If that athlete South African who killed his girlfriend can run without legs, we can walk on his heels.
Hey, you!
Those bitches are making fun of us?
Hey!
Go and make a ride!
She Is vice principal of a middle school and can put you both in punishment.
Hey, one of you could to use his phone - in exchange for Cece?

Do you think Nick and Winston should come in May of that thing?

- You know what song I find neo-romantic?
"Monday Night Football"?
Because I feel a bit 'of embarrassment now?
It 's good to be with you.
I know a lot of things on classical music.
In high school I did the ghost of Rachmaninoff in a play loosely based on "Shine".
Do you believe that it is absurd to think that such a thing?
That is, you think you can come?
You know, once I brought Nick to a business dinner.
E 'was fun!
It was a classy place.
The vest with no shirt?
I mean, it's a simple look.
It did not go well for the occasion.
To not you think we should tell him not to come, right?
- We can say what we want.
- Hey, hey.
And then - then, he sleeps on that side.
- Hey, Nick!
How are you, friend?
Nick, answer, answer, answer, answer!
- The voice mailbox of - Penis Merit.

If we go beyond the fence, - we exceed a limit that we can no longer?
- Shut up, we enter.
Fair enough.
I can not believe we have to go to that stupid thing music.
I just found these coupons two for the price of a water park.
They reopened the wave pool, because they are two years that that guy is dead.
RIP Mike Beakman.

Let's crush the scrotum by our pants tight.
Thanks a lot, guys.
Snakes disgusting.
- They do not want us to go.
- Cursed snakes disgusting.
- We believe stupid.
- I do not want to go there but I do not like the idea of not going because they do not want us to go - and not because we do not want.
- Right, because if we do not, then who will go if we do not want, because we go.
Fair Enough?
Go back.
- Come on, I was very clear.
- Where are we going and why?
We will go anywhere for both reasons.

I did something worse.
We invented a musical about the creatures of the forest.
- # Owls and squirrels, deer and otters # - # Raccoons and caribou # Get out of here, you are not welcome # - # Get out of here # - # Get out of here # # Caribou, Caribou # 'true.
- Because you made me believe that - Because I have not had a night of passion as a normal woman.
I stayed up all night, pretending to be a tree singing.

# - # No, do not tell.
# - # Nobody ever caress me.
# - # Why are only a tree.
# - # They eat only my nuts.

Okay, not good.

And I steal my neighbor's wi-fi.
But what I've become?
Let's turn the day.
Wait.

Ugh!
Can you believe this guy?
Pete is over an hour late for our brunch date.
- Pete?
Who's Pete?
- Oh, it's this dude who goes to my gym.
Thought Jess could use a man with a little muscle for a change, so I set 'em up.
Not gonna marry him, but I'm having fun.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Orange.
Hang on a second, Orange.
I'm gonna send a sext to Pete, which I did.
My first one ever.
Want to see?
It's super hot.
I don't want to, uh Okay, that's just a picture of you in a bra over a T-shirt Holding a sign that says "Property of Pete".
- Not a sext.
- I'm wearing a bra!
- No, that's like a glorified selfie.
- You can see the bra.
- Nope.
- I bet he saw this, and he was like, "Oh, delicious".
You want him to say that?
I have to agree, because the true nature of eroticism is what is not shown.
I never get sexts.
What are you taking?
Just some, uh motion sickness pill.
It's a mild sedative.
My mom just landed.
That's unrelated.
Oh, my God, your mom's here?
!
I'm so excited to meet her.
You probably won't; she's busy.
But maybe, hopefully, I doubt it.
I can't believe I've never met her.
You know, we get together and we laugh and she tells me all the ways that I could be better at things, and then I do them, but not right.
Oh, it's fun.
We have, we have fun.
You know, I wish I had fun with my partner.
Wow, every time I ask Aly to hang out, - she's always like, "Nah".
Hey, Schmidty, vamos.
I want to show you a surprise investment opportunity.
Surprise, Nick?
I'm telling you right now, if it is a boat, I'm gonna be so psyched!
I literally jut got new boat shoes.
Standing here like a damn jabroni.
He hasn't even answered any of my texts.
- He hasn't?
- You don't think he's He is blowing you off!
- He best not be!
- Hell no!
- You guys are getting riled up, huh?
- We are gonna march right over there, and we all right gonna find out what's happening!
Let's go.
Turns out that Pete had a very good excuse for not showing up.
He died.
- What?
- Just got out of the shower Guess who cleaned everything?
Guess who got in deep?
What?
A motorcycle accident?
I didn't even know Pete rode one.
He didn't.
Apparently, he was thinking about getting one, and he slipped and fell on the showroom floor.
Buffed floors beautiful, but at what cost?
The first guy I sext dies.
I should go to the memorial, right?
Jess, don't make this about yourself, all right?
You went on two dates with the guy.
I was one of the last people to text him.
- On Earth.
- Look, you didn't even have sex with him, okay?
You're fine.
So if I'd slept with him, I'd go.
- Or if you'd gone skiing together.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- What are these rules?
- Just don't go.
'Cause if you go, then I'm gonna feel weird about not going, and I ain't going.
Yeah, just come and have a mani-pedi with me.
I'm going; it's the right thing to do.
Oh, so if I don't go, I'm a bad person now?
- Cece.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm surprised.
I thought you, of all people, would want to accompany your best friend to the funeral of a guy she texted, but I guess not.
Ta-da!
What do you mean?
What is ta-da?
We drove here together and parked before you covered my eyes.
What is the surprise investment, Nick?
The bar.
Mike's selling us ten percent.
I really need the cash.
I got swindled by a young gay roller skater.
A rink twink.
I know what a rink twink is, Mike.
Hey, 20 thou and we are part owners, okay?
I've done my research.
There's a consistent revenue and no startup costs.
You're really serious about this, huh?
I really want this, man.
- Good.
I want this, too.
- Good.
Where are we gonna get 20 grand from?
Well, we got the ten grand we made on the Swuit.
Maybe do we have any rich friends we can borrow money from?
Well, let's think about it.
There's the middle school vice principal, there's the cop, the gym teacher.
Let's not forget about the community college student.
- Whew, lot of options.
- Yeah.
It's tough, it's frustrating.
Yeah, huh damn it.
Schimdty just had an idea.
I know that face.
Give it to me, give it to me.
What are you thinking, big cat?
What are you thinking, big cat?
I just Think, now, if we own it, don't be kicking it.
Just Yeah, oh.
Aah!
Ouch.
Okay.
Hey, pal, uh, what's happening?
My mom still owes me my bar miztvah money.
I mean, we can ask her, but, you know, she's - Pushy, overbearing, controlling.
- So, what?
Oh, she's a typical Jewish mom?
It's anti-Semitic when you say it like that.
So-so what, she likes to get involved?
That's great, you know.
I don't feel very comfortable when I'm around her.
Well, boo-hoo, she thinks you want to have sex with her.
Try learning about the birds and the bees from her using a doughnut and a banana.
By the way, neither one of which are used for what you think they are.
How could that be?
Hey, want to grab a bite later?
You know it, partner.
Hey, Aly, uh, want to grab a beer after work?
Ooh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

He never did his thank-you cards.
Mom, I just thought that you know, that was so long ago - Well, you know.
- If I just gave you the money, what kind of lesson would that be?
You finish your cards, you get the money.
That's fair, isn't it?
You didn't finish your thank-you cards?
There's a hat in the bag, too.
Try it on.
Put it on.
That's very nice.
Take it off, you're in a restaurant.
Sure about this?
It's not too late to bail.
We're going.
It's the right thing to do.
Look, we'll be in and out of there in five minutes.
It'll be so packed, no one will notice.
The right thing to do.
Is it?
And uh Pete said "If you gotta puke, Duffy, just puke".
Almost time to tell the story about your close friend Pete.
I'm just gonna tell the truth.
We went on a few dates.
That's it.
I'm Val, Pete's girlfriend.
I'm sorry.
Would you mind going?
How did you know Pete?
Um, from work.
We worked together.
You're a sports agent, too?
- Wow - Yep.
Okay, we got a lot of thank-you cards to write and not a lot of time.
Let's get into it.
I'll start, okay?
Let's go, here we go.
"To whom "it may - concern" - To to whom it may concern?
- I'm on a vibe.
- Nick, these need to have personal details.
My mom is gonna check them.
All right, then get me the guest list.
Where have you imagined that I've been holding onto the guest list for all these years?
Just carrying it around in my wallet?
This is impossible.
This is gonna take some serious detective work.
It's a good thing I can call backup.
- Hey.
- You said this was a work thing.
It is a work thing.
It's a work-style thing.
You see, we need your skills to solve a cold case.
Hey, you want your bar mitzvah money?
Tell me her name.

- I don't believe you!
Just relax.
Relax.

Dehance, dehance.
- Scott Rubenstein!
- Scott Rubenstein.
My mom's CPA.
Scott Rubenstein deceased.
Yes!
Yes!
Love the dead ones.
You know, Pete wasn't just a sports agent.
He understood sports.
Like, he knew the rules, all of them: offsides, unnecessary bumping, what happens if you hit a bird with the ball you throw - Excuse-excuse me.
- Can I, uh, borrow her for a second?
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.
- What's up?
- Uh what the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to save that poor girl's feelings.
If she knew the truth, it would shatter her.
I am going to the nail salon, okay?
- Bye.
- Cece - I'm out.
Hey, wait!
Guys, wait.
No, stop guys.
The only sport I know is Ricky Ball, and I'm pretty sure my friend Ricky made that up.
No.
Lying about who you are is not the right thing to do.
- I am going.
- Coach Is this, uh is this Pete's thing?
He was my agent.
Of course he was.
Who else would represent NFL star J.J. Watt?
Uh, Pete was my best friend and, uh God, it's good to see you.
Wouldn't the couch be better over there?
All that light?
Or do you like to live like a radish, underground?
So we worked really hard on the on the cards.
Let's see what we got.
Okay.
But you know what would be better?
Connie's into gardening.
You should mention that.
And if you really want your card to pop, you can use a nice fountain pen on silver stationery.
And you should sign your full name, not just Schmidt.
I mean, you have a lovely first name.
Great!
I'll just make all those changes, Mom!
Okay.
You're not getting me into your pants, you little jackhammer.
Oh, I don't want you in my pants, Louise.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
- So then Pete says to - Allen Iverson.
- "you want to keep sportsing on the - "Grizzlies.
"but if you want me "to show you the money, then You gotta finish your career off with the '76ers"!
And it was classic Pete.
It's so nice to remember work as more than just a thing that kept Pete on the phone all the time.
You're very welcome.
Oh, Val, you should have Pete's phone.
All those memories and photos It's in the garage with all his stuff.
I'll give it to you before you go.
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, we gotta find that phone before Val sees the sext.
Yes, it is the right thing to do.
Like I've said all along.
I got a good thing going with J.J. and I'm not gonna let you ruin it.
That's the funeral spirit.
What are you guys doing in here?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for Pete's phone.
So are we!
Did you sext him, too?
No.
I fired Pete over text, so I didn't want to crush his family.
That's why I'm at the memorial.
Not because it was the right thing to do?
No.
No.
I mean, we never even went skiing.
Who makes up these rules?
Now What are you guys doing out here?
- Um - Singing.
S What?
We like to sing.
Together.
About - Sports.
- Food.
Sports foods.
That's fun.
It's Would you guys Would it be putting you on the spot if I asked you to do one?
- I think that wouldn't be appropriate.
Actually, yes.
I feel like it's a little Hot dogs Hot dogs Everybody loves hot dogs Hot dogs Dogs Everybody's favorite treat is hot dogs Hot dogs Pretzels!
Whoa, partner!
Wait up!
That work-style thing was pretty fun.
Let's parlay that into a beer.
My buddy has a bar he works at, down the street.
It's carpeted, so Bishop, what don't you get?
No.
Are you okay?
Oh, hey, man.
Thanks.
- Yeah, I don't know, man.
- It's just I'm talking to a ladybug.
Squeeze my hand!
Just one more push!
You're almost there!
The first child is always the hardest!
Hey, bud.
- Hard candy?
- Is it butterscotch?
No, 'cause we're friggin' strangers.
"Is it butterscotch"?
So, you freaked out a little back there, didn't you?
Not to use some Popsicle psychology "Popsicle psychology"?
Yeah, it's pop psychology for short.
'Cause, you know, you eat the Popsicle and you love it so much and then you're stuck holding the-the stick?
You get it.
you get it.
- Not really, but - I think you have some pent-up resentment towards your mom.
She's trying to control you!
She treats you like a little baby who can't do anything for himself.
That's why I never wrote the cards in the first place.
Go tell that to your mom!
She'll understand.
I don't understand.
The couch looks good here though, doesn't it?
It opens up the whole room.
Louise, I think what your boy is trying to say is Shut it, Nick.
Honey, why do you hang out with him?
You know Nancy Borkow?
Her son just moved to L.A.
He wrote a movie script for the movies.
I can connect you.
You need better friends!
Enough, Mom!
You don't get to choose my friends!
You don't get to choose anything!
Because this is my life!
It's my dream and nothing's gonna stop me now!
It feels like that's from something.
- It feels like, it feels like it's from a movie or something.
- My life - Yeah, I think it's a song.
It's a song.
- Like some sort of song, right?
- It's the Perfect Stranger theme.
- Well, you know, it doesn't matter!
You know, we did a good job with those cards, Mom.
And we don't need any of your money.
Whoa, we're all being very emotional.
Let's just slow everything I'm moving the couch back!
Gosh!
Did you nail that thing down?
That's You move that all by yourself?
I'm an adult man, Mom.
And Nick is my best friend in the whole wide world.
And we're gonna buy a small portion of that bar without any of your help.
And also, there's some leftover chili in the fridge if you get hungry, and, please, make sure to put a plate over it before you put it in the microwave.
I don't want it to splatter everywhere!
And that's why they call it The out-of-peanuts Blues Stadium taco.
Thank you guys for being a bright spot on my sad day.
Aah!
- Shucks!
- Sorry!
I thought I saw Pete's ghost!
It was a paint can.
Are you sure about?
Ugh!
We gotta find this phone.
And get the hell out of here.
Okay, it's ringing.
Can anybody hear it?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
There's another box.
What the hell?
"Property of Pete"?
He made my sext his called I.D.?
This is a sext?
JJ fired him over text!
After the day I had, I needed this.
Me, too.
What happened?
I know you were talking to yourself.
Now you're talking to a stranger.
Get over it.
Is that a crime in California?
What happened?
I got dragged to a random dude's funeral.
Who dragged you?
My friend.
She always thinks she knows what's best.
Who's your friend me?
No.
I got accused of that today by my son.
He's tired of me babying him.
But he's my baby, so what am I supposed to do?
Maybe you have to let go a little.
This is why strangers talk.
You're a genius.
Want to see a picture of my son?
He's handsome.
Nah.
I'm kind of in love with my ex, so All right, you can't date him anyway.
You're not Jewish, so over my dead body and all that.
Today was not a win for me.
It's the right thing to do.
I don't even know what that means.
- Well, you made today about yourself.
- Mm.
Not to use popcorn psychology, but it's human nature.
You know?
Soon as I saw JJ walk in, I was, like, "JJ Watt, be my best friend".
I got to do something.
Should I tell Aly off?
Uh put in for a new partner?
What's the right thing to do here?
I can say with 100% certainty I have no idea.
Look at you.
I'm proud of you.
- I learned from the best.
- That's awesome.
What a wonderful moment we're having today!
You know what?
I'll figure it out myself.
Thank you.
This is from that sixth grader over there.
Hmm?
Aly, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to explain.
Look I hung out a lot with my last partner.
And we got close and - You shot him?
- What?
- He died?
- No.
Oh, my goodness is he?
Did he survive?
What are you talking about?
How did you partner die?
He didn't die!
So, what's your point?
He just fell in love with me!
- Oh oh!
Oh!
- Yeah.
- Ooh - And it messed everything up.
And I just don't want that to happen again.
Damn, you're conceited!
Don't nobody want your babies.
I know that now!
I mean, you brought me to your loft and showed me a bar mitzvah video.
- Friends?
- Cool, cool.
Just, uh don't go falling in love with me.
- 'Cause I'm lovable as hell.
- Okay.
I think I'll be okay.
All right.
Another!
Oh, my.
Michael we'd like to buy your share of the bar.
And although we don't have the full $20,000 at the present - You don't have the money?
No.
- But we're the right guys.
No, the right guys would have the money.
Or Kieran Culkin's mouth.
How about Owen Wilson's nose?
Mom?
Oh, my God!
Schmidt, is this your mom?
Hi.
I've heard so much about you.
How's Long Island?
Any cute Schmidt stories?
I need less from you.
Okay.
I met a Mexican woman at the nail salon who made me realize I need to let go.
You're a man.
And you deserve your bar mitzvah money.
Thanks, Mom.
Mike, we want to buy your ten percent of the bar.
This bar?
!
There's a dying catfish laying on the sidewalk out front!
This would be a hilarious time for me to back out but okay.
Yes!
We're part owners!
We're part owners!
How great this moment?
I just think you'd be more of a success socially if you let people come to you.
You know what's fun?
I'm not gonna be able to sleep until we're best friends.
Nick, can you believe it?
You're a bar owner.
I'm so proud of you.
None of this would've happened - without Schmidt standing up to his mom.
- It was so scary.
I can't believe I missed her.
We still can use the other - Yeah - You know, that's not how it works.
It's just this is my favorite section.
I wanted to It's a financial share.
- To Schmidt's mom.
I do want to have sex with her.
- Nick.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Okay, Schmidt, you ready for your feedback for the week?
Yes.
Uh, let me just pull up my performance grid.
First off, thanks for keeping sex quick.
You were like a dog with an ice cream cone, and I loved it, but screaming "that's how Schmidty do" was not ideal.
Even though that's how Sch-Schmidty did?
Well, Schmidty did, and he did it good, but mommy doesn't want to hear - how Schmidty's doing.
- Note note taken.
- Okay.
Great.
Good.
- Note taken.
I feel like I'm watching a porn set in an HR department.
You know, Fawn is teaching me how to be the most effective and successful man and lover I possibly can be.
Really?
I thought you were fine before.
When you two were together?
Which time?
The the first time or the third time?
Because 'cause you two were very off-and-on.
In a in a very confusing way.
I've had sex with him so many times.
We have a fun thing together, don't we?
Super fun, yeah.
I really enjoy it.
What is her what is it, Cecil?
What is your name?
You'll learn it.
Don't worry.
Fawn's helping me see that I haven't reached - my full potential yet.
- Well, obviously, none of you have.
No, I have.
I'm a cop.
And, as of yesterday, my mom no longer buys my plane tickets, so You need a ten-year plan.
Are you in a relationship that's headed towards marriage?
I am not currently, but I did go on a date with somebody named Charles last month.
She was a woman, but she was named after her uncle.
Well, Winston has no game.
Dude took a girl to a cement plant.
To see how rocks were made.
That's not where rocks are made.
And she loved it, then she abruptly moved away.
Work sucked, my friends.
Hear ye, hear ye.
Milady.
I dub you Sir Winston of the Roll of Egg.
Ah, yes.
Yes.
Who are you in this story?
I'm the jester.
I'm not gonna eat here anymore.
You'd think that the school board would want to give kids computers, but no, they just want to get reelected so they can keep dressing like Realtors from the 1980s.
Solid municipal burn, Jessica.
Fawn Councilwoman.
Councilwoman do you think you could help me get some traction with these people?
Oh, funnily enough, I have a charity event tomorrow with other high-powered L.A. women.
- I'll put a word in with Yowtz.
- Martha Yowtz?
- Yeah.
- The lioness of Los Angeles education?
- Yes.
- The straw that stirs the school board's drink?
- That's right.
- That is a woman I'd like to get to know.
Is there any way I could come with you to this event?
Ah, you know, it's really a networking thing.
Well, that's perfect, 'cause I'd love to network her.
- With her.
It's "with" - You network with her.
Yeah, it's "network with her," and you don't really strike me as the "networking" type.
You're more of a "follow a butterfly around for a day" kind of gal.
Oh, sister, I'm a middle-school vice principal.
You think I got this job without knowing how to network?
Most likely.
Yes.
I got an office with a door, bub.
Pencil me in.
I'll yak with Yowtz.
The press will be there, and I could use a photo with an educator, so okay.
- Oh, great.
- Oh.
Hey.
Do you still need me for the photo op?
I will need you there, actually.
I'm trying to become more accessible on social media.
Speaking of which, is there some way you can make your skin look less white in photos?
People are saying that you're haunting me.
I can do that.
Absolutely.
100%.
- Let me just make a note.
- Wonderful.
And, Jess, the event tomorrow is at a golf course.
Do you golf?
Does a bear eat with his hands?
I don't know.
- I'll be there.
- Great.
So I say to her, "Water?
I barely even know you".
Stop talking to me like we're in the middle of a conversation.
- We just sat down.
- All right.
- I hate when you do that.
- Okay.
Winston.
That is a beautiful girl right there.
Wow.
- Just say something to her.
- Yeah, just say something to her.
Shawty, what that thang do?
No.
- What was that?
- Dude, I think it's a nervous tic that stems from my lack of self-confidence.
We got to help.
I can't watch this.
Excuse me, miss?
Hi.
- Coach, stop.
- Um, this is my buddy, Winston.
Um I don't know what he's doing with his mouth.
That's not his normal smile at all.
I'm gonna fix that.
If I could just Both sides even it out.
Better.
- I think he likes you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Just go talk to her.
You got it.
- I don't - Okay, okay, I'm going.
- You got it.
You got it.
- He's coming.
He's excited to talk to you.
Hey My friends.
Hello.
I'm Winston Bishop.
Winston Bishop.
KC.
KC!
Just be like, "Yo, KC, where JoJo at"?
In rehab, probably.
- He's he was on drugs.
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Um I don't know what to say right now.
Uh, kind of blowing this, huh?
Uh Um, I think you're very beautiful, KC, and I would like to see you again soon like, later today for lunch?
I'd love to.
Really?
- Here.
- Oh.
I'm gonna put in my number or come with me to this thing in the park I'm going to now and we can grab something after.
You know, I saw Nick Nolte in the park once.
And I was like, "Yo, Nick Nolte, what you doing in the park"?
And he was just like, "I'm just hanging out".
Yeah, so I thought that was notable.
I'm going to a rally to protest the police.
Do you want to come?
Or we could just do lunch.
- Let's do lunch.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Nice to nice to meet you, KC.
Fawn is none of my business, and Schmidt seems to really like her, so whatever happens, I'm just not getting involved.
Then why are you on your way to hang out with him?
- What are you doing?
- He said to come over.
He said it was an emergency.
What if he does something sexy?
That's like Gollum hanging out with the One Ring.
It'll be fine.
Ooh.
Hey, Cece, I'm glad you're here.
I need you to put bronzer all over my body.
None of the guys are here, and they also refused to do it.
Um, all over.
I know you're giving me a look, but, really, like, all over.
All the cracks, the crevices.
The engine, the caboose, everything.
Oh, okay.
Gripped it and ripped it.
You da man.
No, say, "Fawn is the man".
Fawn's the man.
Fawn's the man.
Oh, hey, there's Yowtz.
Woman's got more connections than a flight from Burbank to Sri Lanka.
Well, then, it's a good thing I bought the airport neck pillow in the gift shop, because You know what that means.
- I got this.
- Okay.
How the hell are you?
Jessica Day.
I need 20 computers for my school.
Just met you, but noted.
You're up.
Thanks.
What?
Oh.
You walk towards the Whoops.
Oh, dear Lord.
Why are we putting this on your body?
Aren't you going to be wearing a shirt?
Well, you know, Fawn wants me to be prepared for all scenarios.
What if somebody gives birth out there and I have to swaddle the baby in my polo?
Yeah I've never been under this kind of scrutiny before.
I'm having my teeth shaved by a 25th of an inch.
Fawn thinks that I have the teeth of an immigrant.
She says every time she looks at me, all she can see is Fievel Mouskewitz singing "There Are No Cats in America".
Those little those little mice Jews.
I mean, what do you think, Cece?
You you like Fawn, right?
Yeah, I mean, as-as long as you're happy.
- There you go.
- What the hell?
What?
Why am I sparkly?
Sparkly?
!
You bought the bronzer with glitter in it.
Cece, please, you gotta help me, Ce Fawn's gonna kill me!
Okay, just don't get too pressive.
You'll crease!
So stupid!
I feel like I'm trying to get into an 18-and-under club in Tucson!
So, yeah, at the rally, the was this kid I know from the youth center who was arrested last week because he "fit a description".
I mean, he's 14 he doesn't even fit into his jeans.
- Yeah.
- Anyways enough about me.
Let's, uh, talk about you.
What do you do?
What do I do?
Um okay.
Well what do I do?
Um Okay, the truth is Hey, man.
You know them?
Oh, not personally, no.
Hey, what's up, Bishop?
Oh, yeah, I do know them.
We went to school together.
See you at work, bud.
More importantly we work together.
You're a cop?
Me?
A cop?
No!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't No, no, no.
Get that out of your head.
Uh, what I do is I'm a - male stripper.
- A stripper?
That's why they were wearing the uniforms.
Yeah, I see where you why you would think that.
No.
A surprising amount of day work for a stripper.
You know, we just go in there, we do our routine while they eat their lunch salads.
Wow.
You just pray nobody orders soup.
Lost a lot of good men to soup.
It's hard to gauge temperature when you're just dipping and running.
You'd be surprised what you could replace a ladle with.
- Nice day.
- Beautiful.
What happened to the top of my hat?
You take it?
A little, uh little visor humor.
Give me back my hat!
I'm kidding.
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I'm just joshing.
Just Joshua, Joshua, joshing Do you ladies want to join my network?
- Uh, you ladies can just go ahead and play through.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I'll catch up with you later.
Uh, so, how-how do you feel that the networking is going?
Pretty good.
I would call it, like, a solid B. It's a cruise ship disaster.
Look, Jess, if you want those computers, we have a lot of work to do and not a lot of time to do it.
Shake my hand.
Gross.
What is your name?
Jess?
You have the confidence of a child that was raised in a basement.
Say it with pride, and include your job title like it's the second half of your name.
Like this Fawn Moscato, City Council.
Jessica Day, Vice Principal!
How the heck are you?
Lighten it up with a quick joke whenever possible.
Nice shoes.
Look like you chopped off Big Bird's feet, you murderer.
And try not to make jokes about murdering Sesame Street puppets if you can.
- Good note.
- Now, tell me Are you wearing underwear?
Oh, yeah.
Big-time.
Lose them.
I never wear underwear in networking scenarios.
Gives you a secret; an edge.
Besides, I firmly believe that power emanates from the vagina.
So, why block it?
It's not the only thing that emanates.
What does that mean?
Other stuff.
So I said, "Tammy, are we playing golf, or are we making sand castles"?
Tammy is the worst.
She told my kid to shut up once.
I nearly punched her.
I don't want to start talking business while we still have a whole tournament to play, but I'd love to connect about your ideas in the clubhouse.
Let's meet up there when we're all done.
Great.
I'll see you in there, Marty.
May I call you Marty?
Oh, I'd prefer it.
The clubhouse?
That is where you close the deal.
You are in, my friend.
Now, let's finish up this game.
No problem.
Write a six and let's go.
They should start putting GPS in golf balls, am I right?
We already got lapped by Sue Kim from the Korean Women's League, and she's 100.
Jess, she is literally 100 years old.
And I'm I'll tell you what Not a young 100.
Martha doesn't strike me as the type of person who gives computers to cheaters.
You really don't understand how networking works.
The computers are just the thing you talk about when you're really talking about how to help each other become more powerful.
Just like the money for this golf thing it doesn't go to charity.
It just pays for the event where we network.
Isn't that cool?
Yay, America.
Were the computers ever really on the table?
You're still talking about the computers?
Okay.
Uh, no.
No.
No money for computers.
I should've never listened to you.
I also should have never removed my underwear, because now it's drafty and I feel vulnerable to wildlife.
Are your underwear sticking out of your pocket?
Are those boys' underwear?
They're unisex.
None of your business.
Look, will you forget the ball?
Or none of these women are ever going to invite you to play golf again.
Well, I don't want to play golf with these women again.
I don't want any part of this.
If I can't have the computers, I will I will stay here and I will play a clean game of golf.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Fawn, I need to go find my ball.
Like an honest person.
Okay.
Oh, look it's a baby bird.
No, it's a dead baby bird.
I need to move on before I get emotional.
Can't believe I didn't tell her I was a cop.
With everything that's been going on, I just I feel like she wouldn't respect me.
- You want to know what I think?
- No, Nick, I don't.
This is something you can't understand.
- Because I'm not black?
- Uh What, because I don't work for NASA, I can't fix a rocket ship?
If you don't work at NASA, they're not gonna just let you walk off the street and fix a rocket ship.
- You're missing my point.
- Besides, you lost your right to talk to me about race during the O.J. trial.
Is in the white Bronco Why does it have to be a "white" Bronco?
Why not just a Bronco?
I can talk to you about this.
I mean, we grew up together.
We went to the same schools, we watched the same shows, we listened to the same records.
Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and bitch chew like this.
Hercules.
- Was that your Eddie Murphy?
- That's Eddie Murphy.
That was so bad, it wasn't even offensive.
I said "Hercules," and everyone associates that with Eddie Murphy.
Whenever you do your impressions, it makes me super uncomfortable.
Fine.
You know what?
You want to do this?
You and me are gonna get weird about race?
- Do your Seinfeld.
- Come Nick, that's not - Do your Seinfeld.
- What's the deal with bananas?
I mean, they got orange juice, you got apple juice, where's the banana juice?
I never thought of that.
Ah, boy.
'Cause you got orange juice, you I love you, but you're white, I'm black.
I understand where she's coming from.
When I was a kid, we used to run from the police.
Even if we did nothing wrong, it was just out of habit.
Why haven't you ever told me?
'Cause you'll never get it.
How long have you been standing there?
Uh, right around, "Your mama got a mouth on the back of her neck, and the bitch chew like this".
- Now, that's Eddie!
- I don't see the difference.
Hercules!
Hercules!
Hercules!
- He's doing the laugh!
- That's what I was doing.
Stop, Nick.
I honestly don't see the difference.
As the only other black man in this loft, I feel like I should weigh in.
This issue really hits home with me, and I feel like I have a lot of thoughts and ideas that I need to get off my chest.
- Thank you, Coach.
- But I'm hungry.
- Man.
- I skipped breakfast, and lunch is gonna be dumb as hell.
Race talk snacks Race talk snacks, gotta get me Some race talk snacks Gonna be super uncomfortable!
- So, KC - Shh - I just feel like - Can't-can't weigh in.
- I know, but I - Can't weigh in.
I do have something I want to say that's not a race Shh, don't.
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna tell her the truth.
I'm a good guy; that's all that matters.
- That's what I was gonna say.
- I want to make this No, no, no.
Shut it down, Nick.
Your mother got a mouth on the back of her neck, and she chews like this.
Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.
So the good news is you can't see the glitter anymore.
Great.
Well, what's the bad news?
You look like, um can't exactly put my finger on it.
I look like the dead body the police pull out of a lake.
That's how you describe it; you look dead.
I don't want to look like a dead boy.
I want to look like a living boy.
Why are you calling yourself a boy?
Because I'm freaking out!
Freaking Freaking out.
Oh, no.
It's-it's Fawn.
Hey, Faw hey, Fawn.
What the Jewish God did you do?
In an attempt to look less ghost-like, I put on some bronzer, but the bronzer had glitter in it, and now You look like a wood carving of yourself.
The press is here.
And single women have proven to be less appealing to voters.
Fix it and get here now.
I am Fawn Moscato, and I will not miss a photo opportunity!
Faw Oh.
Fawn?
How about a fake beard?
Get some double-sided tape, we can shave Winston's cat Okay, you know what, enough.
I cannot just stand here and watch Fawn treat you like she's your pageant mom.
She needs to accept you exactly how you are, or you need to find somebody that will.
'Cause I think you are fine as is.
Damn it.
You know what, you're right.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Can you drive though?
I want to fix my makeup in the car.
For me, not for her.
I don't want to scare anybody.
Ugh.
I think I'm drunk from my face fumes.
I've never seen so many strokes taken on a single hole in all of my life.
This has got to be some kind of record.
Do you care to comment?
Hey!
Not bad!
Look at her go!
The hole's behind you.
Thanks, Marty.
- Par was five.
- I know, Marty.
You're the worst golfer I've ever seen.
Look, I don't care if I look stupid.
I didn't come here to climb the ladder.
The only reason why I came here was to get computers for my students.
And that's the only reason why I came: for the school.
I respect that.
I'll get you those computers.
- Really?
!
- Yes, I will.
In 2018, when the district is fiscally solvent.
I'll take that as a victory.
I support Vice Principal Day.
It is education that will bring water back to this city and will rebuild the middle class Don't let me back down.
Don't worry, I will not.
You look so crazy right now.
- You look like a doll boy.
- A doll man.
I'm a d I'm a doll man.
A doll man who's about to get his dignity back.
Let's beat China!
I'm Fawn Moscato!
Oh!
Oh.
I can't believe it.
Now, this ball is a symbol of the unity Wow!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn, Fawn.
- What?
What's going on?
- You're not wearing any, uh Each one's like a snowflake.
What do you mean there's a meme?
It speaks?
Well, what does it say?
Oh, well, that is just crass.
Yes, I know I wanted a more accessible Web pr Will you stop laughing, Lou?
You're a father!
You're my father!
Oh, no, no, it's it's carpet cleaner.
You know, I thought I'd take it right down to the base.
I'll probably have to regrow some skin, but it's all right.
It's okay, Schmidt.
Look, I understand if you want to break up with me.
I'm a laughingstock, and you shouldn't be associated with my brand.
Which is tainted.
An unfortunate choice of words.
So, what was it you wanted to say to me?
Fawn, I don't want to break up with you.
I like you just the way that you are.
No offense, but you're terrifying to look at, and you smell like a chemical fire.
Taint that the truth?
- Yeah.
- Did you see what I did there?
- I just'Cause you did it, then I - It was too too soon.
It's too soon.
- I wanted you to feel good about when you said it though.
- Okay.
KC?
So um this is the real me.
I'm proud of what I do, I really am.
I work with a lot of great people, and I want to be one of them.
Plus, if there are ever Ghostbusters, I know they're gonna recruit from law enforcement first.
I know you're mad at me.
I just came to say that.
I'm not mad that you're a cop.
I'm mad that you lied.
Well, tell you what, uh, is there any way I could take you out again and, you know, uh, be so honest with you that it scares the hell out of you?
I don't know.
That uniform is kind of distracting, isn't it?
Maybe you should take it off.
You lied and said you were a stripper; it seems like the fair thing to do.
Just in front of all these people?
In front of your colleagues?
Oh, okay.
I hear some "whoos"!
You ain't got no Ginuwine or nothing?
Seriously though, I'm I'm I really am a police officer.
I can't really be here stripping for you It's a clip-on ladies.
And it's on the ground.
Here we go.
Uh-huh, I want y'all to get y'all ones ready.
I wear my underwear two sizes too big.
This is a This is a thing.
This is a thing I gotta do.
This is a thing I got to do in order to get my belt off.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
: Coach and May are fighting.
We don't want to disturb them.
They're not fighting.
I know how to read body language.
Look.
Her arms are crossed in a position of dominance, and he's playing his forehead like a piano.
Will you clowns focus?
My waffle is in the toaster, and if I wait too long after it pops, it'll get hard.
Look, I know about relationships.
Winston can vouch for me.
That girl, KC, just texted him, "What's up"?
That riddler.
So I had him text back an empty bubble.
Is he thinking about her?
Or is a baby playing with the phone?
She don't know, but she want to know.
There she is.
There she is.
Oh.
Hey.
Morning.
Hello.
How do?
Hey.
Oh, someone left a waffle in the toaster.
Bye, guys.
Man, this waffle better be hot or I am going Durst on y'all!
Hey Coach.
Why Jess, are you talking like that?
She thinks you and May are fighting.
No, we're not fighting.
We did break up though.
Oh, my God, I knew it.
I mean, I'm so sorry.
What happened?
May accepted a job in New York as a section musician for the Met.
Oh, has Alan taken a liking to her?
Oh, bravo.
Good for You know, I've always been a fan of his.
When he conducted, uh, Das Rheingold with the Royal Stockholm Orchestra, it was magnificent.
Jar or slap?
I don't have any cash on me.
Good slap.
Are you okay?
Do you want to talk about it?
No, I'm good.
Yeah.
I'll miss her, but we're still friends.
We're cool.
I'm cool.
Cool.
All right.
He is not good.
Winston, get back here!
We need to powwow about May and Coach!
Winnie's gonna need a minute.
What are you reading?
What is One Woman's Journey Up Inside Herself?
It's really inspiring.
I actually want to be the woman in this book.
"Finding inner strength in a time of crises".
Cece, are you in crises?
I'm fine.
Cece's fine.
How are you?
How's Fawn holding up?
If you must know, my paramour Councilwoman Fawn Moscato has been so strong since the incident.
You know, reporters are calling it Panty-Gate.
There's pictures of her naked lady-bottom all over the Internet.
Sid, put the phone away.
You picked it up right when I said "naked lady-bottom".
Please.
You guys are good, then?
You know, 'cause the last time we spoke, you said you were feeling a little, you know, used.
Well, not anymore.
We're a team now.
Fawn and Schmidt.
Fawmidt.
Vomit?
No, Fawmidt.
You're saying the word "vomit".
No, I don't hear that, but okay.
Fawn's holding a press conference later today, and I don't mean to toot my own shofar, but I'll be standing there right by her side.
So this scandal is actually bringing you two closer together.
Team Fawmidt has never been stronger.
I heard it there.
Wow, that sounds exactly like "vomit".
That's a problem.
Mm-hmm.
"Roughly the same length as The Pearl".
How is that a pull quote?
And that is how babies get made.
It's gross, right?
How does the sperm find the egg?
Propelled by its tail, the sperm travels up the canal until it reaches the egg.
Now, for us, it's only a couple of inches, but for Mr. Sperm there, it's miles away.
Miles and miles and miles away.
It's almost like why would the egg want to be so far away from the sperm?
You know?
Like, didn't the egg and the sperm have a great time together?
And then you're just gonna pack your bags and leave and go to New York?
To play music with some other sperm.
You're just-just gonna leave?
You're gonna leave your sperm and go play music with other sperms?
!
And I'm cool with that!
I'm cool with that!
You know, I got eggs.
I have eggs on deck!
This sperm got swag.
All those other sperms ain't got swag like me.
Can any other sperm sport this much green and still look dope?
No!
That ain't tight!
This is tight!
This is tight!
: I just want you to come back, and I  I guess I chose the wrong day to observe Health.
COACH : I miss her!
May!
Listen, thanks for standing next to me up there, Ponyboy.
I hope this show of remorse will keep these reporters off my back.
Oh, I know it will.
And then, you know what, once this is over, maybe we get out of here for a little bit.
Lay low, Oh.
rent a cabin in the woods, Yeah.
read some poetry, have horizontal sex.
Okay, two of those three things sound like fun.
Now, here's your statement in case you're asked any questions.
Oh, a st I'm not gonna need a statement.
I'm a seasoned improviser.
Hey, guys.
We're the Belly Laughs.
So I need a location.
How 'bout fat camp?
That's adorable.
But just, please, read what I wrote.
I will.
But I'm not gonna do it until I get out there.
You're gonna want me in the moment for this.
Okay.
Good afternoon.
Um, before I answer any of your questions, my partner would like to read a statement.
Honey.
I am a sick man.
On Saturday last, Councilwoman Moscato was caught not wearing underpants because I I asked her not to wear them.
Why?
Because it turns me on.
What I did was wrong.
I'm so sorry, Fawn.
I'm sorry, Los Angeles.
And I'm sorry to the man upstairs, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Dress shirts on a Monday?
You know how it is.
Coach breaks up with a lady, we take him out, and he gets loaded.
Yeah, I know how it usually goes when Coach breaks up with a girl, but May is different.
Sometimes she comes over and they don't even have sex.
I don't get that.
Trust me, I am right about this, just like I was right about them fighting.
I'm on, like, a streak here.
I might just be an expert in love.
Like a you know, like a love doctor, if you will.
I will not.
You are the least qualified person to call themselves a doctor of love.
Exhibit "A": you dated me.
I rest my case.
Court is adjourned.
Guilty as charged.
Put I would stop that.
Case rested.
Listen, I got to say I agree with Nick on this one, Jess.
I mean, it's been a whole day, and KC still hasn't texted me.
Well, that's just proof that the bubble is working.
Look, you guys, Coach needs to talk to May.
Trust me.
He is in pain.
I'm happy and I'm healthy and I'm ready to party!
Let's get drunk!
You're wrong.
Coach.
Do you want to talk about what happened today or?
Talk about what?
Nah.
Hey, um, actually, can you do me a favor?
May's gonna be recording later.
She's gonna stop by and pick up her rubber circle.
May has a diaphragm?
No, it's the thing that you put on the floor to stabilize the cello.
Condom.
No.
No, it's the thing you put on the floor to make sure the cello stays put.
Cello stabilizer.
Oh, yeah.
Cello stabilizer.
Oh.
Well, wouldn't you like to be here when she comes by?
No, that's gonna be hella weird.
I want to party!
Yeah!
We 'bout to par Come on, party!
I'm gonna do this and gonna do this, this, this, this, this.
What was that speech?
I'm sorry, okay?
I told you to read the statement beforehand, and then you told me that terrifying story about doing improv at a fat person's camp.
I didn't know that the statement was gonna blame me for Panty-Gate.
And by the way, for your information, the Belly Laughs did not "do" improv.
We reinvented it.
I know you must be embarrassed, but you saved me.
Yeah, well, people think I'm a sicko now.
One of your aides spit at me.
Was it Shallon?
Yeah, that's a lisp, but still, he's fired.
Look, if you want to leave, I completely understand.
But the truth is I can't do this without you.
Well, now Ponyboy is feeling very conflicted.
Just one last photo op.
You and I having a lovely evening.
Show the press everything's back to normal.
And then I promise it'll just all be about us.
Could we do horizontal sex?
Yes.
With foreplay?
It's a deal-b It's a deal-breaker.
Uh Yeah.
It's a deal-breaker.
Okay.
Fine, yes, fine, yes.
Oh, God.
No, please.
Oh Oh, God.
May.
Cece!
So Coach and May broke up?
Long story short, they shouldn't have broken up, and I am the only person that sees this.
I realize I'm kind of an expert in love.
A love doctor, if you will.
Where are your crackers?
A-Above the fridge.
Cece, did they raise your tuition again?
Why are you so hungry?
I've decided I'm going to climb Mount Shasta.
By yourself?
I'm leaving for three weeks.
I want to be like the woman in the book; I want to go on a climbing trip and find myself.
Okay, um Ceec, are you sure you're ready for a climbing trip?
Jess, I just I can't sit here and watch Schmidt with Fawn.
And I don't think they're breaking up any time soon, so Cece, they're never gonna last.
He doesn't really love her.
Did he tell you that?
No, but as a doctor of love, I sense these things.
The Love Doctor just knows.
May.
Hi.
Uh, I'm here for my endpin anchor.
Yeah.
Ah, thank you.
Very sorry to hear about the breakup.
Are you okay?
Um, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm here to talk if you ever need to.
In hard times, it's nice to have a friend, May.
Thanks Jess, right?
Yes.
Well, uh I'm in the middle of a recording session.
I got to get back to the studio, so see ya.
Bye.
Yeah, Jess, she looks real broken up about it.
I I'm a mess.
I know!
: The doctor is in.
Wait, what?
Nothing.
Cry it out.
Mmm!
Ah.
Wow.
I've never seen Coach go this hard after a breakup, man.
You sure he's okay?
It's good, it's good, it's good.
You treat an outside wound with rubbing alcohol, you treat an inside wound with drinking alcohol.
That's science.
I feel that, man.
It is time to turn things up.
Sidney!
Do what you do!
Aw  This is my jam.
MAY : We've only been dating for a few months.
I just thought that that breaking up was, like, the smart thing to do, you know?
I know you're upset, sweetie, but I I can't understand anything you're saying with the crackers.
Do you love him?
I think I do.
Well, then maybe moving to New York doesn't mean you have to break up.
: So you think that I should that I should ask Coach to move with me?
Okay, how about we put down the crackers?
I think she wants Coach to move to New York with her.
Oh!
Yes, yes!
I mean Yeah?
You-You You think that he would say yeah?
Yeah.
Definitely.
He's crazy about you.
He had a meltdown today in health class.
Now, the kids did learn that sex is emotionally complicated, so it was a good class, but trust me What Jess is trying to say here is that if you if you really know how you feel about someone, you need to act now.
Wow.
Am I really doing this?
Yeah, but not before we clean your face, 'cause it's caked in snot.
Ooh, yeah, Coach!
Who you think he's gonna hook up with?
It's a tough Monday crowd.
It It's nearly impossible to say, but I'm gonna go with the white bodysuit and, uh, the leopard print leggings.
She looks smart to me.
No way.
No way.
My money's on the one with the wedding ring whose husband is clearly over there in the corner spying on her.
Yeah, he's not happy about that.
Oh, oh, ooh!
Dora the Explorer just entered the scene!
You're tiny.
I like it.
There she g Oh!
For the kiss!
Oh!
The winner.
The winner.
What the hell?
Oh.
May's here.
Coach!
May here, she here!
Wh-Wha Uh, May!
Wh-What are what are you doing here?
No, come on.
No, no In a flash, he is gone It happened so soon In case you were wondering, she, uh she did get her little rubber holder thing.
Coach, um, I wanted to apologize.
Not now, honey.
He needs some time, honey.
I brought over a beer.
We'll take that beer.
Give us that beer, honey.
Sorry.
I'm not a freaking love doctor.
I'm Dr. E.D. Ote.
Dr. Idiot.
Yeah, I get it.
I just never understood the whole love doctor thing, anyway.
I guess I was just hoping that with all the mistakes I've made, at least I could help you guys find love.
That I didn't go through all that for no reason.
Yeah, but no one has the answers, you know?
It's love, it makes no sense.
It's messy.
There's no such thing as a love doctor.
You know what, Cece?
Go on your trip.
Go get over Schmidt.
Don't listen to me.
I'm gonna climb that mountain.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
But I'm not gonna do it for Schmidt, I'm gonna do it for me.
Good.
Go.
I love you, girl.
Love you, too.
Hey, don't smile.
Don't smile.
Look sadder that you're buying underpants.
Underpants make you very, very sad.
Oh, I hate being here so much.
These underpants make me so uncomfortable.
That's perfect.
There's that fat boy improv training.
Now, next, I'm going to ask for something with a little more coverage; you're gonna flip out, say you can't take it anymore, and leave the store.
Then tomorrow, we enter you into some kind of rehab facility.
When you get out, we'll announce that we're getting married.
Married?
What?
I don't Shh.
Yes.
Shh.
Yes, yes.
Okay.
So what I say is we build on this momentum, okay?
And we get married.
I know it's not the most romantic idea in the world, but we'd be happy.
And then, we play our cards right, you and I are living in the mayor's mansion by 2020.
Fawn.
Fawn.
No.
No?
Oh, n-no to some of it?
No to all of it.
We can't get married.
I barely even know you.
You You know me.
The real you, Fawn.
This is the real me.
I'm a politician, not in The Vagina Monologues.
I mean, what do you want?
I can get you anything you want.
You'll be rich, I'll be powerful.
I'm realizing just now that it's not what I want.
I don't want any of that.
I want to be in love.
I want to be I want to be crazy in love.
Okay, well, certainly don't quote BeyoncÃ© and then pretend like you just thought of it.
Uh, uh, I want to be drunk in love.
But that's also a BeyoncÃ© lyric.
Come on, Fawn.
You're not really in love with me.
I'm not really in love with-with you.
We just look great together buying underpants.
Are you breaking up with me?
I guess I kind of am.
Well, um I don't want this to come out the wrong way, but does this mean I lose your vote?
Never.
: I just can't stand to be in here any longer!
Surrounded by these underpants!
Red ones and yellow ones and blue ones and pink ones!
And this woman with her brassiere-slash-teddy!
Underpants everywhere!
They're driving me nuts!
I feel like I got underpants all over my body!
Schmidt out.
This is ridiculous.
Enough is enough.
Get out of here, paparazzi.
No, leave me Get-get out of my way, sir.
I just want to say something.
No.
And then I'll leave.
Look, I'll never get involved in your personal life ever again.
Okay?
Because I have no idea what I'm talking about.
And I know that now.
You could just you could just troll for basic bitches at the juice bar, and I will say, mm, nothing.
Okay?
So, look, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.
I do love her.
I'm crazy about her.
Yes!
I was right!
Love Doctor!
I'm back.
Really?
I thought it was just a regular breakup.
But in all fairness, I hadn't thought about it that hard.
I mean, what do I do, man?
You know, it's like she's going to New York.
Yup.
I can't go to New York with her.
That's crazy.
You know?
I like my sun on the right and my ocean on the left.
It's a rule of mine.
Plus, I'd have to leave you guys.
Can't leave you guys, I mean, I finally have a home.
All right, flash forward to the future.
You're married.
Kids, grandkids.
Mm-hmm.
I'm long dead.
Naturally.
Of course.
And you look over to the woman sitting next to you.
And she's gray.
She's old.
She has that, like, grandma smell.
You have a grandpa smell, but you got Grandmas always smell like like right when you open a cupboard.
Yeah, she has that smell, but Mm-hmm.
you love her.
Be honest with yourself.
Is that fat old lady sitting beside you Mm Honestly, right now, in my head, I'm just picturing, like, a beanbag chair with a wig on it.
Okay.
We have gone too much into the description.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Is that May?
I think so.
Well, that's big.
Let's go get her.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
Let's go get May.
Yeah!
Hey, Jess, she texted me back!
The blank bubble worked!
Guys?
Have you seen my white friends?
In 40 years, when we're old and Do it.
a mess of fat, loose skin hanging, I have boobs, and you've got hair on your face Holding my rock sack while I'm sitting on the toilet so it doesn't fall in the water.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, as you get older, your testicles lengthen.
No, what I'm saying is I love you.
Oh.
And that I would be a fool if I let you leave to New York without even fighting for us.
Ernie I love you, too.
But I I can't stay here.
I don't want you to stay here.
Um look, I know we haven't been dating that long, and, um, this might seem crazy, but I was won Will you move to New York with me?
Yes!
That!
That's what I Yes?
!
Yeah, that's what I wanted to do, yeah.
Right.
So, we're moving to New York?
We're moving to New York.
We're moving to New York!
Jersey City.
What?
Jersey City!
Jersey I don't  Well, this is all you, Jess.
Come on.
This is all you.
I mean it.
If Coach were hanging out with me, we'd be beating up a priest right now.
You had a lot to do with this, too.
No, really.
All that stuff about "Who do you see yourself next to"?
That's-that's really good.
Do you do that?
Who-who do you see yourself next to?
Winston mostly.
Ah.
Yeah, me, too, actually.
I just see a really old Winston.
Eating handfuls of birdseed out of the bag.
He gets really into birds.
Hey!
Play some music!
Play some music!
I'm sorry about Fawn.
Yeah, sorry, buddy.
Yeah, you guys were good together.
She was fine.
Okay, that's enough.
I know you guys didn't like her.
Hated her guts.
So much!
Wait.
What are we watching right now?
That girl just took her boobs out!
Nick, why are you watching smut?
It was already in the DVD player.
I didn't want to get up and get it.
Schmidt, are you sitting on my pillow?
Who leaves porn in the DVD?
What's it doing out here in the first place?
The only thing we use it for.
Might as well just leave it in.
I'm sleeping on the couch.
Furguson and I are fighting.
Why is that pillow wet?
It's a good story.
Let's just watch and see what happens.
What are you smiling at?
Nothing.
For crying out loud, take this soft-core off the TV right now.
Why is this pillow wet?
Furguson Jess, I have to see how the story ends.
There isn't any plot!
This is the wrong time to stop this, trust me.
Get you and your wet pillow and your big old legs out of here.
Nick, I know you want that.
I don't want to eat that.
Get that damn pizza out of my mouth!

There he is.
Mr. New York.
Mr. Broadway.
Happy last day.
- I made you this.
- Aw.
It's a bunch of pictures of you.
Well, I had to take the necessary precautions, because the last time you left, you forgot who I was.
You called me Jebecca.
Well, thank you so much, Jess.
I really like it.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Well, that's a kick in the shins.
Look, nothing personal, but, you know, I've moved a lot, so I have this system that I use.
Duffel bag full of essentials only.
And one Jess cube.
You can't get rid of me.
Look, Jess, when I move, I make a clean break, okay?
I'm not going to get all sentimental.
And you promised you wouldn't make a big deal.
No, you're right, you're right.
I promised you I wouldn't.
- You did.
- But what about everyone else?
Showtime!
Hit it, Schmidt!
Huh?
Oh.
Nick, where's your Donald Trump wig?
- It's here.
-  Ugh.
This was not my vision.
I specifically said "dazzle".
You said "razzle-dazzle," and we said, "We don't want to do that".
Yeah, we told you this is not what he would want.
This isn't how men say good-bye.
: Live from New York, it's Coach's good-bye!
Start spreading the news Yeah, show's over.
We ain't doing this?
I'm leaving today I want to  The system works.
Remember, essentials only.
It's not just for packing; it's a way of life.
You want to move forward, you got to get rid of the past.
That means throw out all your junk - Right - Emotional junk, actual junk.
Got to make a clean break.
Clean break.
That's right.
You're blowing my mind right now, Coach.
- Doesn't even mean anything.
- Or does it mean everything?
I cannot believe you're all buying into Coach's crazy system.
You guys have fun with your clean break.
I'm gonna go to my room, and I guess I'll have to cancel the horse and carriage that I hired to take you to the airport.
May and I are driving.
You are now.
You guys sure you're up for this?
I am ready for this.
I'm single again.
I'm a new man.
I'm leaving the past behind.
I want to get rid of my stuff, but all my stuff is really, really good, and I just can't get rid of it.
It's not, and you have to.
Everything you own is trash.
You're basically a hoarder.
Not true.
Everything has meaning.
Everything is connected to something else.
You need to be hard on yourself, okay?
- Now, take this box and fill it up.
- Okay - Think I can do it?
- Absolutely.
Okay.
I'm gonna get hard and fix myself.
- What?
- That's not No.
That's I didn't No.
Oh, here we go.
The Regis Philbin crepe pan.
Come on, Coach.
You can't give this away.
Remember February 2014?
Or, as we like to call it, - Crepe History Month.
- Crepe History Month.
It was a hot winter's night.
We were drunk, but our judgment was on point.
REGIS PHILBIN : You hear that sizzle?
Let that sizzle speak!
Those pancakes are paper-thin.
There's only three left, so act fast.
This crepe pan is a knockout!
- Coach, we got to act fast.
- We got to act fast.
- We got to act fast!
- They're so thin!
You got to take the Rege, at least for the memories.
- The Rege, man.
- The Rege!
- You know, I can't get rid of the Rege.
- Can't get rid of the Psych!
I'm getting rid of the Rege.
Memories are nonessential, all right?
That's what makes the system work.
I found an ant farm full of candy wrappers.
Is this essential?
Like, really, what do you think?
Hmm?
I need you to get harder, Nick.
Can you get harder for me?
- What?
- Do you need me to get hard with you?
I feel like you're not meaning to say what you're saying.
Talking about cleaning up.
Schmidt, I think you forgot about this box.
Oh, oh, that's cool.
Thanks, man.
- I appreciate it.
- Oh you got a Cece box.
So what?
It's not like everybody hasn't seen your Phylicia Rashad box.
- No, you hav You have?
- Birthday card Don't please don't go in the Cece box.
Don't do a crude drawing of you and Cece and your mixed-race child.
Yes, I painted that.
Ooh, five dollars!
Come to daddy.
This five dollars belongs in the box.
It's from the night that I first met Cece.
Looks like it's finally just the two of us, huh?
Oh, God, you're about to say something stupid, aren't you?
Yeah.
Girl And then I said something stupid, and Cece made me put money in the douche bag jar.
What'd you say?
You say you can flex - your butt cheeks like pecs?
- I bet you were all like, "You're making my dong go crazy"!
I bet he said something chauvinistic  that comes from insecurity but ultimately leads to something endearing.
You know, it doesn't matter what I said.
- Nonessential, right?
- Exactly.
So, good-bye, Cece.
May some poor street urchin with a perfect 34-D enjoy the sports bra that you left in my car.
We got to tell Schmidt that Cece is in love with him.
Right now, he is out there throwing away all of his Cece mementos, acting like he's just going to move on.
Jess, I cannot watch this when I know what I know.
- I know.
- We got to tell him.
I promised her I wouldn't get involved.
I always meddle.
I've learned my lesson.
She's trying to get Schmidt out of her system, and we have to support her, even if it means letting her climb a mountain with no prior knowledge or experience.
Yeah, but does she know that Schmidt and Fawn broke up?
Is she getting our voice mails?
I don't know.
She hasn't called me back.
Maybe there's no reception on the top of Mount Shasta.
We try again.
- Hey, Cece, it's Je - Hey, yo, Ceec, what up, fam?
It's your girl Winston, aka Winnie the Bish, aka-ak-aka Brown Lightning.
Schmidt dropped Fawn like a bad habit, okay, so ain't nobody riding shotgun.
So you better get on while the getting is good.
You got it?
I hate that you're so good at this.
I was so nervous.
Look at all this crap.
Look at this.
"Associated Strategies".
"Ass Strat".
What a joke.
More like "Butt Strat".
This place is total butt.
Hey, Jess, it's our sex mug.
- What?
- What?
Oh nothing.
It's just a mug that Nick and I used for sex.
- Oh, gross.
Like, in it?
- Ew!
What?
No.
No, we used it when we were dating.
It was hard to find times to be intimate with everyone around, so we needed to come up with a code.
Just a way to let each other know we were aroused without arousing suspicion.
That's wordplay.
It's also a free writing lesson.
When one of us left the mug on the entryway table "Ass" out meant it was time to - Make love - Bone.
Yeah, make love.
We're getting rid of this thing especially since you guys aren't using it anymore, right?
- NICK and  Right.
- Wrong.
I, Winston L'Andre Bishop, saw that very mug on this very hallway table just last week "Ass" very out.
Ooh!
Winston, that mug hasn't seen any action in over a year.
You're off your rocker.
If I were off my rocker, would I take a weekly selfie with my cat?
Oh, Winston.
You see, just last week, I took this selfie with : Wait, not that one.
That's crazy.
Not that one.
I forgot I had this one.
This selfie, in front of that table.
Sex mug.
Question is, who put the mug out?
All right, let's not play the "who put the mug out" game.
We should be focusing on Coach.
I saw you checking out Jess's butt last week.
- No.
- Yes, she was wearing the "look at me" skirt.
- All right, well, let's not try to - My money's on Jess.
- Wait.
- She hasn't had sex since Ryan, and desperate times call for Nick Miller.
Is the "look at me" skirt the green one?
- Hey.
Do not change the subject.
- You are implicating yourself by changing the subject like that.
Hey!
I put the mug out.
Okay?
And, actually, nothing happened, and I regret nothing.
Now, I'm going to my room, and I'm considering throwing out my sunglasses.
So long, old friend.
Just doesn't feel right.
: Welcome back, old friend.
Hey.
Got a second?
Jess, we don't have to talk about it.
Obviously, I was the one who put the mug out, so I wanted to thank you for covering for me.
- No problem.
- Obviously, we're broken up, and it was a moment of weakness.
I didn't even know you put it out; I didn't see it.
- Oh!
- No harm, no foul.
- Well - We didn't bone.
No bone, no phone home.
- Great.
So we're cool.
- I'm cool if you're cool.
Fanterstic.
I'm going to knit a scarf for Coach.
- I'm sure he'll love it.
- Okay, bye.
- Thanks for the chat.
- Sayonara.
Hey, Nick, uh, do you want to know why I put the mug out?
- We're cool!
- We're cool.
- Go knit that scarf.
- Right.
: Okay.
No, no, no!
Cece!
I want it back!
I want it back!
Pop, pop, little bubble!
Let that sizzle speak.
It's time to flip.
Care to do the honors?
Ah, sure, man.
That'd be cool.
Rude.
Winston, you're not gonna trick me into taking the stupid pan.
It stays behind that's the system!
Clean break.
You know what, fine, Coach, don't take it with you.
Leave everything behind.
Try not to remember anyone.
We are nonessential.
Message received.
Nah, Coach, I don't think so.
Because this crepe belongs in the belly of someone with a heart.
Damn it!
Ouch!
Why are you so secure?
You're filled with things that nobody wants!
Oh.
Thank God.
Hey, how are you?
I dropped something in the bin, and I need it back.
You Jewish?
I just need a bo I just need a box.
I just can't part with you.
- Okay, I'll tell you what happened.
- You knit fast.
Winston had fallen asleep polishing his candelabra.
I had just opened a bottle of pink wine, - and then you showed up.
-  Oh, hey.
Just working out.
Got to sweep the temple.
Damn So, see, it wasn't my fault.
In your defense, I've been working on my body, doing my burpees, and it shows.
: I'm not gonna do that again.
- Nick - Warrior pose!
Nick, is there anything that I do that makes you think about putting the mug out?
No, I-I can't think of anything.
Right.
It's just not the way that this old brain works.
Clean break.
Great.
Clean break.
I agree.
Jess, hold on.
Hey, hey H-How is that?
Jess, wait!
Yeah, I'm stuck.
Well, we seem to be in a bit of a conundrum.
How do I know this is your box?
Do you have any identification, "Cece"?
Cece's my ex-girlfriend; it's a box of her things.
But I can tell you everything that's in there.
There's some paintings, erotic writings, there's a brassiere.
Why would you have her brassiere?
Well, you know, she left it in my car, and I kept it.
She never asked for it back?
Okay, um, Wally, look, it's a box of memories.
Memories that I'm not ready to let go of yet.
Maybe if I could talk to Cece Can't talk to Cece; Cece's on top of a mountain.
Look, I know this is unusual, but I need that box back, Wally.
I need it back more than anything else I've ever needed in my life.
Please.
Does she know she's on the mountain, or is she being held there against her will?
Damn it, Wally, give me the box!
No!
No!
No!
No!
-  - Wally!
Stop blowing the whistle!
You're sexually safe!
Coach, is that a bigger bag?
My old bag broke, so I got a wheelie.
Same system.
Still only essentials.
Is there a pan in there?
Nah.
Nah, that's not a pan.
That was just, uh, the sound of two track pants hitting together.
You know, the buttons be like ting ti But, um  Yeah, since I got this new suitcase, I might as well take a few more things.
Just to fill up space.
Know what I mean?
Just to fill up space.
Like, uh take these glass grapes.
Just to fill up space.
Not that I want them.
Of course not.
And this blanket.
For cushioning.
That smells nice, huh?
For cushioning, dude.
These mystery novels.
Take these.
Not 'cause they're Jess's, just because I'm an avid reader now.
Stop smiling at me, man.
I'm taking Nick's workout jams.
'Cause, uh that one time I trained him, : saw a lot of results.
: I remember.
He was so fat.
And I'm taking this remote.
Because you always hit the info button by mistake.
No, no, it's not by mistake, Coach.
I like to know more about the cast and crew.
Remote's gonna miss this TV so much.
Our TV is gonna miss that remote.
Smells like all our fingers.
Hey, Jess.
Hey.
Do you really think I haven't thought about putting this mug out?
Oh, I don't know, Nick.
You said it.
What's past is past.
Clean break.
Think about my living conditions for the past year.
I live across the hall from my beautiful ex-girlfriend.
And your living conditions you live across the hall from your beautiful ex-boyfriend.
Two true beauties.
So you have thought about it.
I'm a man.
- I am a human man.
- Interesting.
You're the one who's always getting out of that shower in that little towel, Jess.
Or you're wearing your glitter or your pantyhose.
They're driving me crazy!
Okay?
I know how hard it is to get those pantyhose up, and I just I just sometimes want to rip 'em down.
Just admit it, Miller!
You're thinking about putting the mug down right now!
No.
Admit that you want me to be thinking about it.
I don't want you to think about it, so stop thinking about it.
Well stop talking about it and then I'll stop thinking about it.
- So, you are thinking about it?
- Look, Jess!
I'm not not thinking about it.
Hey, guys.
Want to know what happened to me today?
JESS and  We're kind of in the middle of something Fine, I'll tell you.
I spent $500 to get back a five dollar bill.
Go ahead, call me a fool.
You won't be the first person to call me that today.
You're a fool!
I need to move on.
I'm never gonna get Cece back.
And I know it's my fault that I lost her.
You lost her twice.
- You had her - I know I lost her twice.
- Why would you have to?
- Then you got her, then you blew it.
Then you got her Who are you clarifying this for?
Are you sure you know how Cece feels about you?
Yeah, I mean, she said a thousand times - that she only wants to be friends with me.
- Schmidt Jess, Cece doesn't love me and she never will.
So I think it's time to let go.
- Nick, I want you to have this five dollars.
- What?
Go buy yourself something special, like a burrito.
I love burritos.
Oh, I have to tell you something, Schmidt!
I  But I can't tell you.
So, I'll I'll tell you.
Loophole!
Nick Cece's in love with Schmidt.
What?
Yeah.
For real?
- Well - Also, Winston promised - Why are we talking about Winston?

- Winston Cece loves me!
Nick, we did it!
I got to go!
Can't wait for Cece to get back from her trip.
I'm going after her.
Coach  I used to wish that you were uglier.
I don't wish that anymore.
I only wish you the best.
Hey, you're the handsome one in the loft now.
Big responsibility, but I think you're ready.
All right, you guys, I'm off.
Off to climb a mountain.
I'll see you in autumn.
Winter at the latest.

Deeply.
But I assumed that you would never because I've I've messed this up so many times.
And you've made it very clear that you just want to be friends with me and I value that friendship so much.

Schmidt.
