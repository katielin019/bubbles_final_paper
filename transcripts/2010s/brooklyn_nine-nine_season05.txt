{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 Just eating butter like a popsicle, huh, Boyle?
Yeah, I know, I'm spoiling myself, but I'm depressed.
Or have you forgotten that Jake, my best friend, is in prison?
- Wait, Jake's in prison?
- Yeah!
He and Rosa were framed for a bunch of bank robberies by Lieutenant Hawkins.
Oh, right.
And where's Gina?
On maternity leave!
We were all at her baby shower - last week.
- Okay.
And why am I bleeding?
I don't know, Hitchcock.
Oh, so you don't have all the answers.
I'm bleeding because my piece-of-crap son-in-law bit me.
Look, we all miss Jake and Rosa, which is why we have to keep working the case.
There has to be some way to exonerate them.
I've been looking, but I can't find anything - and I don't know what to do.
- "I can't find anything and I don't know what to do": - title of your sex tape.
- What is happening - right now?
!
- They caught Hawkins trying to flee the country.
She confessed to everything, - and they let me out.
- Oh, my God, Jake, is it really you?
Are you really here?
- You know it, baby.
-  But first I gotta hug my best friend.
- Yeah.
- What?
Welcome back, Peralta.
I just heard from the mayor.
To apologize for what happened to you, they're sending you to Disney World.
You and one male guest.
As long as I don't have to go on any of the scary rides.
- I'd just go for the shows.
- Yeah!
Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!
Boyle, Boyle, Boyle!
Boyle!
Were you dreaming about Jake again?
Why did you wake me up?
!
I told you never to wake me up!
Wake up!
Rise and shine!
Good morning, Caleb.
You woke up happy for once.
You're damn right I did.
It's visiting day.
It's visiting day!
Happy visiting day.
Happy visiting day, Tommy.
You excited for the family to come?
Tino, is Maria on her way?
Miguel, happy visiting day And he hung himself.
Oh, my God.
Guard!
Guard!
- Hi, hey.
- Hi.
Oh, man, three weeks is way too long - between visits.
- I know, I'm so sorry.
It's been so hard to get down to South Carolina between work and spending every free minute on your case.
All right, that's enough touching.
You used all the touching time, Amy.
I get 100% of the goodbye touching time.
- 100%.
- So, Charles, I gotta ask: - what's going on with your hair?
- Well, it turned white from the stress, but I didn't want you to worry, so I dyed it back to my normal color with a splash of Batali.
Do you like it?
So, how's my case going?
Have you found anything on Hawkins?
I've been working it in here.
You know, when no one's watching.
In my cell.
At night.
In the dark.
I guess I've been mostly thinking about it.
We're tracking her 24/7.
You know, watching her men, combing her old files, but she's done a great job at covering her tracks.
We will find something, babe.
I swear.
Don't give up hope, okay?
How are they treating you?
Are you safe?
Yeah, I'm in protective custody because everyone in gen pop hates cops.
I'm not really sure why.
Something about us locking them in cages and letting the world pass them by.
-  - So, it sounds like you're isolated and haven't had any chance - to make new friends.
- Well, my cellmate, - Caleb, is okay.
- Just remember he's in prison.
No matter how small the crime, people don't change and don't deserve second chances.
Charles, relax.
I'm not gonna replace you.
Trust me, all I've been thinking about is when you guys are gonna get down here.
And now you are, and we can finally talk.
-  - There's an incident in the yard.
We're going into lockdown.
- Inmates, line up.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.
I have 50 more minutes.
I need this.
- Back to your cells right now.
- No!
My touching time.
Sarge, Captain.
Oh, you guys brought Hitchcock.
Uh, no, we just bumped into him in the lobby.
- We don't know why he's here.
- Jenny, baby!
I love what prison's doing to your figure.
Okay.
So, how's prison?
Nobody likes cops in here, so I had to earn their respect by starting a bunch of riots.
Got thrown in solitary for a week.
What's going on with your face?
I hate seeing you like this, so I'm flexing my eyes real hard to keep from crying.
It's okay, we can still have a normal conversation.
So how's the food?
Pay no attention to him, Rosa.
He's very emotional, Rosa.
Why are you saying my first name?
Well, Rosa, I read an article in a medical journal that said one destabilizing aspect of incarceration is the constant dehumanization, Rosa.
You need to be reminded that you're more than just a number, Rosa.
You are Rosa Rosa.
- Yup, that fixes prison.
- Is there anything we can do to help you?
Anything you need done - on the outside?
- No, I'm good.
- It's not a problem.
- Rosa.
- We're here for you.
- Rosa.
- Whatever you need.
- Rosa.
Okay, I'll come up with a list.
The alarm went off before we could even talk.
Aw, that's too bad, bud.
But at least you have people that wanna come and visit you.
My family hasn't been to see my since my trial.
You eat nine people and all of the sudden they "don't know who you are anymore".
Wait what?
Did you say "eat people"?
Are you a cannibal, Caleb?
Well, that's not how I would define myself.
If we're going by what I'm most passionate about, I would say that I'm a woodworker.
Why did you think I was in protective custody?
I don't know, I guess I hoped you were another cop wrongly convicted of crimes you didn't commit.
Nope, I did all my stuff and more.
There's tons they can't even trace to me.
The secret is eating the evidence.
Okay, this is just great.
I don't see anyone from the outside for another three weeks and my only friend here is a cannibal.
Woodworker.
Look, if you really wanna talk to people on the outside, - just get a cell phone.
- Yeah, that'd be great, - but it's illegal, right?
- There's this guy in gen pop Romero.
He can smuggle anything into this place: phones, drugs, - big bag of hair.
- Why would you want that?
You know what?
Don't tell me.
The less I know about you, the better.
Okay, let's find this Romero guy.
Right now?
I really wanna chomp down - on this meat.
- Caleb This is scary.
I don't like being so near gen pop.
It's fine.
It's not like they're all waiting for an opportunity to kill us.
I'm sure some of them are actually nice, like this gentle giant here.
Hello, sir, what brings you to the fence today?
Just here to stab you if you get too close.
Neat.
Caleb, remind me not to stand too close to the fence.
Will do.
Oh, here's Romero.
So, what's up?
You need another bag of hair?
- Yeah.
- No.
We'll talk later.
Same order, though.
I hear you're the man to talk to - about getting a cell phone.
- I am.
But it'll cost you.
Phone's 100.
- $100?
That's no problem.
-  I got no use for cash.
I want 100 soups.
- Soups?
- Yeah, ramen.
They're like a major currency in here.
Really?
That is very surprising.
You can't smoke anymore, so ramen has replaced cigarettes.
- NPR did a big thing on it.
- I thought they sold ramen - at the prison commissary.
- I don't want commissary soups, - you stupid little bitch boy.
- Okay, that's fair.
- I deserve that.
- I want flavors you can only get on the outside Chili-lime shrimp, southwestern chicken - Street flavors.
- Picante beef.
Oh, that's my favorite.
Get me picante beef, bitch boy.
Okay, so I just get some ramen and then I get a cell phone.
Prison is easy.
-  - You stood too close - to the fence.
- Yeah, I know, Caleb!
Captain, Diaz sent us a list of favors she needs us to do for her.
She didn't hold back.
First, she wants us to move all her furniture - into storage.
- Okay.
- Then file her taxes for her.
- Really?
And then she wants us to type up and email these letters to Pimento in Argentina.
- Are they sexual in nature?
- Crazy sexual.
But we can't say no.
She's behind bars - and we made a promise.
- Right.
You're right.
Oh, also, she's worried about her motorcycle sitting idle, so she wants us to take it out once a day.
Here.
I think you should do this.
You're more the biker type.
I've seen you use a toothpick in public.
Motorcycles are death machines.
I have three kids.
I'm not risking it.
Are you saying my life matters less because I don't conform to society's heteronormative, child-centric ideals?
Are you really playing the gay card right now?
Yas, queen.
Thanks for coming down again.
- What's going on at work?
- Not much.
I'm investigating a big-time money launderer.
Moves tons of cash under the table.
It was stressful, because the brass got involved, so there were a lot of eyes on the operation.
But in the end, they gave us room to work.
Well, sounds like it was a very successful operation.
Here you go, bro.
- 105 picante beef.
- Great.
I'll keep five packs for myself.
What do you want me to do with the rest?
Thanks for the soups.
Here's your cell phone.
Thank you.
And by the way, as someone who's eaten a lot of ramen in his life, here's a tip: leave a few noodles uncooked and then sprinkle them on top afterwards like a garnish.
Gives you an extra little fun bonus crunch.
-  - Ha-ha!
Saw you coming that time.
Like who's got prison all figured  He threw the shiv.
You can't do that!
I can't believe I'm hearing your voice.
I know.
It's so amazing.
And now every day can be like visiting day, and we can just talk about whatever, whenever Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake-Jake.
- I gotta go.
- Jake?
Hey, warden.
What's up?
What the hell are these?
I found them - doing a sweep of your bunks.
- Oh, uh - we got those at the commissary.
- Picante beef.
You think I don't know that picante beef is a street flavor?
I was being kind to you by putting you two in protective custody, but if you're gonna bring contraband into my prison and flaunt my rules, pack your bags.
- You're going to gen pop.
- Gen pop?
But my tough prison beard hasn't fully grown in yet.
Just give me six or seven more years.
I can't believe we're going to gen pop.
A cop and a cannibal?
Everybody's gonna be trying to kill us.
I know.
What are we gonna do?
You're a psychopath.
You can protect us in there, right?
I mean, you killed and ate - a bunch of people.
- They were children, Jake.
Weak little children.
One conk on the head - was all it took.
- Damn it.
I can't believe I'm friends with a cowardly cannibal.
Here she comes.
Big smiles.
- Hey, Rosa.
- Hey.
How's my bike?
Great.
It actually was a lot of fun to ride once I got the hang of it.
And you were able to finish everything on my list?
It wasn't too much, was it?
- No.
- Not at all.
If anything, you didn't ask enough of us.
Great, 'cause I thought of a few more things.
Oh, were you able to send that email to Adrian?
Oh, yes, he wrote back right away.
It wasn't as graphic as I feared.
He wrote the number eight equal sign, equal sign, equal sign, equal sign, equal sign, equal sign, equal sign, capital D oh.
I see what this is.
- This is a - Yup.
Cream turkey.
You know, what I could really go for is - People potpie?
- First of all, Jake, great alliteration.
Second of all, just because I was arrested for cannibalism doesn't mean that all I like to eat is people.
I was gonna say "a chicken burrito".
- Man, my cousin was so tasty.
- Oh, come on.
Oop hello.
You're gonna die in here, cop.
- What's up, Caleb?
- 'Sup, Chico?
It's so crazy.
They hate you so much, - they don't even care about me.
- Yeah, congratulations.
I think I'm gonna need to join a gang.
And that way I'll have protection - and no one will mess with me.
- I don't know, man.
- Joining a gang is not that easy.
- It would be for me.
I once took a seminar on how to ace job interviews, - and I'm really good at them.
- Really?
- This I've gotta see.
- Hey, everyone, I'm Jake.
Thank you so much for sitting down with me.
I just need a moment of your time, and then you can get back to watching your stories.
What can I tell you about myself?
Well, I'm hardworking, incredibly motivated.
I can make a shiv out of anything.
I am deceptively athletic.
I'm not sure if your gang likes to play B-ball out in the yard, but I can dunk.
Oakley  And I'm just super excited to join - What are you guys called again?
- ISIS.
ISIS cool.
Well, I am excited to join ISIS.
I can't believe I went 0 for 16.
I got rejected by my safety gang.
I'm gonna die in here.
Well, there is one more option, but it's a long shot.
Remember that guy Romero who you got the cell phone from?
If you got in good with his crew, nobody would dare touch you.
But he is real scary and crazy.
Okay, and how anti-Semitic is he?
- Average?
- Then let's give it a shot!
So, Picante Beef, I hear you wanna be - part of my crew.
- Not ideally the nickname I would've chosen for myself, but yes, I think I could be of help to you.
Do you know how long I've been in this prison?
17 years!
- Well, you look great.
- And not once, - in all of that time, Beefy - It's just "Beefy" now?
Have I ever seen anything as disrespectful as a cop coming into my prison telling me how to eat my soups!
But damn!
Crumbling the noodle on top gives it an extra little crispity-snap!
I was blown away.
Wasn't I, Tank?
Hasn't stopped talking about it.
- Come here, Beef Baby!
-  Great.
So, does this mean - that I'm part of the crew?
- Nobody can touch you now.
Wow, guess all it took was the ramen tip.
Actually, you gotta do one more thing for me - to close the deal.
- Absolutely no problem.
Actually, I have a great idea for a ramen dessert.
- You make it with Jell-O mix.
- I need you to kill a guard.
Oh okay.
Great.
Cool-cool-cool-cool, cool-cool-cool.
Beef Baby's out for blood.
So Okay, this guard you gotta kill, Wilsom Oh, I'd rather not know his name.
It's Alan Wilson.
He's got a three-year-old, Dexter.
They call him Dex.
Cool.
I'm not worried at all about little Dex.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
- I mean, I grew up without a dad.
- Yeah?
- Me too.
- So did I. See?
And we're all doing great.
Can I ask what this Wilson did - to deserve this?
- He beat the crap out of me.
- How?
- More importantly, he keeps interfering with my business interests.
But it's about my thing too, right?
Of course.
How are you gonna do it?
Shiv him, shank him, stab him?
Are those different?
Oh, boy.
Should I be asking - someone else to do this?
- No, no, no, no.
It's fine.
I'm gonna prove myself to you.
But what if instead of killing Wilson, we get him fired?
That way, you don't have another man's death on your conscience.
Yeah, that doesn't bother me.
No, of course not.
Why would it?
But if we murder him, there's gonna be an investigation, and that could bring a lot of heat - down on you, you know?
- I can see that.
But that's not how we usually do things around here.
Sure, but you know what else you didn't used to do around here Sprinkle uncooked noodles on top of your ramen.
You're right.
You're right.
You've earned the benefit of the doubt.
You have 24 hours, Beef Baby.
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.
- Jake.
- Beef Baby.
- Jake.
- Beef.
Baby!
Beef Baby.
Okay, here's the plan.
Tank said Wilson beats up inmates, so all I have to do is get him to attack me and then file a complaint with the prison board.
Sure, but whenever the bulls attack us Which happens all the time the security cameras are conveniently not working that day, so it's just your word against theirs.
Well, lucky for me, I have my own camera.
It's the perfect plan.
Hey, I've never been beaten up by a prison guard before.
They don't use that baton, do they?
You seem pretty committed to this plan, so there's no real benefit to me answering.
Sounds good.
So, you painted my apartment?
Walls in "White Wisp," trim in "Honeymilk".
- And you filed my taxes.
- You're getting - your maximum refund.
- And picked up - my abuela at the airport?
- Yes, I went and got her at the Philadelphia International Airport in - Pennsylvania.
- And you broke the news to her about how I got sent to prison and she'll probably die - before I get out?
- Mm-hmm, had that - fun conversation.
- But it was all worth it for you, you poor little caged bird.
Great, because I have another favor to ask.
- Another?
- Yeah, I need you to cancel my cable.
That's it?
That's easy.
I've been on the phone for six hours and I just wanna cancel an account.
Yes, you've mentioned the bundles and I don't want home phone service.
No, do not transfer me, Rodrigo no, no!
No, Rodrigo!
All right, there's Wilson.
I'll go make him mad.
When he attacks me, you film it.
Then afterwards, - we'll meet up in the bathroom.
- Okay, great.
What are you gonna do to get him angry?
Well, I don't know him, so I'm not sure what buttons to push, but I'm sure if I try enough things, something will set him off.
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
- Get back to your table.
- Yeah, you know, I would, except for  - Oh, my God, that's all it took?
- I told you to get back to your table!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
What hurts the most is knowing that prisoners are treated this way every day in our penal system also, he kicked me - in the wiener a bunch.
- Mm.
Show me the video.
I'll send it to Charles, he'll say he got it anonymously, and then  Oh, my God, that's all it took?
Caleb, is this it?
Did you film yourself - the whole time?
- Okay, look, I've been in prison for 15 years.
I'm not good - with new technology.
-  You want somebody to lure a kid to a park using a Lycos chatroom, I'm your man.
Look, just press this button and make it front-facing.
Come on, let's try it again.
Hey, Wilson -  -  Please tell me you were pointed in the right direction that time.
Yes, but there was a different issue.
Caleb!
You added the fiesta filter?
- I'm doing the best I can.
- Tell that to my wiener!
- I'm doing the - No, don't really gosh  Okay, how'd you screw it up this time?
I didn't.
I got everything.
I even zoomed in for some close-ups.
Oh, thank God.
I was so sure that something was gonna go wrong.
Hey there, Peralta.
- Oh, I'll take that phone now.
-  I heard an inmate and a guard were having a fight.
So I go to do what I normally do: - turn off the security cameras.
- Yup, cool policy.
- This place is great.
- And that's when I noticed your cannibal pal taping the whole fight with an illegal cell phone.
And what were you planning on doing with this?
Blackmailing Wilson?
No, I was trying to save his life.
- Ah, come on.
- Honestly.
I was ordered by this guy, Romero.
- I don't know his first name.
- Jeff?
Really?
Romero's first name is Jeff?
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Jeff ordered me to kill Wilson, but I convinced him to let your guy live if I got him fired instead.
Why do you want him to lose his job?
- He's a good man with a family.
- I mean, he did stomp - on my head a bunch of times.
- Those were warning stomps.
What are you, part of Romero's crew now?
No, I was trying to get in.
That's what the video was for, - but obviously, it didn't work.
- All right.
- I'll fire Wilson.
- Really?
- Why?
- Romero's responsible for most of the illegal stuff that goes on in this prison.
I've always wanted a man on the inside.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
The only people less popular in here than cops are snitches.
Well, let's be honest, it's not great in here for trans people.
- That is so true.
- I know.
- They have a hard time.
- It's a problem.
Regardless, I won't snitch, okay?
It's too dangerous.
I'll find some other way - to stay alive.
- All right.
Good luck with that.
Wait.
I'll do what you want if you let me keep my phone.
So, were you able to cancel my cable?
Of course.
It was easy.
Good, because I have something else.
I need you to take my dog to Argentina to be with Adrian on his ranch.
Now, I know what you're gonna ask me, and the answer is no, I don't have a map of the booby traps, but I can tell you how he thinks.
Enough!
I'm sorry.
I hate to say this, but you're asking too much of us.
Is that how you feel too, Sarge?
- Yeah, Rosa, damn.
- Good, finally.
- What?
- Look, prison is awful.
I hate it here.
I'm lonely, I'm scared.
I just wanna be back home, and I was happy you guys were coming to visit, but then you started calling me by my first name, and you kept making that crazy crying face.
The only one that is acting - like himself is Hitchcock.
- You!
- Shirt back on!
- Stop being such a prude.
If I'm gonna get through this, I need to feel like my old life isn't gone.
I need normal interactions.
So, I need you guys to fight with me, and be honest with me, and tell me no when I'm being unreasonable.
Okay, I promise: no more crying face.
-  - And no more pity Diaz.
Thank you.
I can't believe it took that long.
I really thought the cable company was gonna break you.
It did.
But the good news is, you now have Epix, plus some channel called "Tunez," with a Z. Two-year commitment.
What else?
Oh, you're never gonna believe this.
I've been reading.
Reading?
Like, books by real authors?
I don't know, is Philip Roth a real author?
Oh, my goodness!
I wish you had gone to prison years ago.
I'm kidding.
Obviously, I'm not more attracted to you now than before.
So, what else have you been reading?
Oh, hang on one sec.
- Hey, boss, what's up?
- I saw you got Wilson fired.
Nice work.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
I promise you, you won't regret it.
Just one more thing.
I know you used to be a cop.
If you screw me over, I will cut your testicles off and watch you bleed to death in the dirt.
You got that?
Can I trust you?
Yeah.
I got nothing to hide.
I'm your Beef Baby.
Hey, sorry about that.
- Where were we?
- Jake, that sounded really bad.
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Everything's fine.
I'm talking to you.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
So, I got assigned to this one rookie, and on his training day, I made him smoke angel dust at gunpoint.
King Kong ain't got nothing on me.
Isn't that the plot and tagline of The movie "Training Day"?
Yes, great observation, Tank.
That's because it's based on my life.
Lunch is over.
Bus your trays.
- Now, Peralta.
- I haven't finished - my lemon cookie, bull.
- And you're not gonna get to, either.
Give it to me.
Oh, you want the cookie?
- Oh!
- There's your cookie.
- You're going in the hole.
- Oh, I'm going in the hole?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, bring it on!
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Remember what you saw here today!
You can lock me up, but one day I'll get out of here, and I'll come for you!
I'll come for all of you!
Hey, Warden.
What's up?
Next time, don't wait so long to spit the cookie.
I've been waiting in here for four minutes, and it's gross.
- Yeah, it really is.
- Okay, snitch time.
- What's up with Romero?
- All right, he's got a "delivery" coming in on Wednesday night.
One of the cafeteria workers is smuggling something in - with the produce.
- Great.
- See you Thursday.
- Wait, what?
You're just gonna leave me in here, in solitary?
You spit in a guard's face.
That's five days in the hole.
Yeah, but, I mean, you made me do that.
Well, we don't want anybody getting suspicious, huh?
Have fun.
Try not to go crazy.
Okay.
No big deal.
Five days is nothing.
I'm not afraid to be alone with my thoughts.
My thoughts are awesome.
"Die Hard 6" on a cruise ship, pizza bagel restaurant, my father never loved me, I'm gonna die alone oh, boy, that happened fast.
Guard?
Guard!
A 300 call number in the fine arts section?
What is this, Beirut?
You know, you don't work here.
You don't have to reshelve the books.
Well, someone has to.
I'm so sorry.
I'm just really stressed out.
You're a great librarian, and I'm sure you're not the one - who shelved this section.
- I am.
God, Debbie, what is going on with you?
Debbie?
Is that you?
Are you mad?
Because I think I've been more than fair.
Hello, Detective Santiago.
Ah, no need for the gun.
I'm not here to hurt you.
My name is Seamus Murphy.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Every cop in the city does.
- What do you want, Seamus?
- To help.
I know your boyfriend got framed.
Maybe I could give you the proof you need to take down the cop that set him up.
You have something on Hawkins?
She's about to move 5-million dollars' worth of stolen diamonds stones that tie her to the robberies.
I could tell you - how to find them.
- Why would you do that?
'Cause I wanna be friends.
I do you a favor, and one day, you do me a favor.
I don't know.
Think about it.
But don't think too hard, huh?
You only got three days.
Forgive me, books.
Oh, God.
So, how was your first stint in solitary?
It was nothing.
I held it together.
Oh Amy.
When'd you get here?
You've come for my conjugal capabilities.
You're looking real good, girl.
Whoa, lost a booby.
No matter.
I'll just build another one.
More mashed potatoes!
So, what happened with that sweet intel I gave you?
Your tip was garbage.
We busted Romero's delivery.
Get this nothing but toothbrushes, - shampoo, and soap.
- Ooh, lemon verbena.
- Can I keep this?
- Yes, you should you reek.
'Cause you put me in the hole.
- Have you ever heard of Blizz?
- Yeah, the drug, right?
Uh-huh.
And thanks to your pal Romero, it's taking over the prison.
I need you to find out - where he keeps his stash.
- Well, I doubt he would tell me that.
I'm not exactly - in the inner circle.
- Maybe you just need some extra incentive.
Find the stash, or I'll tell everybody you're a snitch.
What?
No.
They'll kill me.
You don't want that, right?
It'd probably be a lot of - paperwork for you.
- Oh, it's not.
It's just one form, and it's already filled out.
We just have to staple a picture of your corpse to it.
Great.
Prison is great.
He said I have three days to decide.
We should tread lightly.
Seamus Murphy is the head of the most brutal crime family in New York.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Are you concerned about Seamus Murphy, Detective Scully, or were you having trouble - with the jumble?
- Oh the first one.
Murphy didn't ask me to do anything illegal.
He just wants me to owe him a favor.
Right, but we don't want to be indebted - to a man like this.
- I understand, but we've been watching Hawkins for a month, and we have nothing to connect her to the robberies.
Maybe we should pursue other routes.
Um, some of us are already pursuing other routes, Amy.
This is Charles Boyle, and you're listening to A God in Shackles".
this podcast is brought to you by Fun Frames make your spectacles a spectacle.
And how is your podcast supposed to get Jake out of prison?
I lay out the facts, people see he was framed.
I build an audience.
I get a celebrity listener.
It's Debra Messing.
She tweets a link.
- Now Sean Hayes is involved.
- Boyle, that's enough.
I know dealing with a criminal is bad news, but I can't just let Jake sit in prison.
Okay, maybe we can figure out what Murphy knows without taking his deal.
He says that Hawkins is moving the diamonds in three days.
That's a new lead.
Let's work it instead of putting your career in jeopardy.
- Okay, let's give it a shot.
- Whoo-hoo!
That was also not about the jumble.
We're all excited about the same thing.
Did you miss me?
Oh, my God!
It's Jake!
Don't kill me!
- I was just doing Batman!
- What's wrong with you?
Never sneak up on me.
- I was sharpening my shiv.
- Right, I'm sorry.
It's prison.
I forgot.
What's up?
I'm busy, bitch.
Well, all that time in the hole kind of I'm clearly gonna be here for a while.
I wanna live my best prison life, and for me, that means doing more for the gang.
Now I was thinking, specifically, I'd be great in and around the world of drugs, because, let's be honest: I'm not great at murder.
- What do you think?
- Nah, that's okay.
- I don't need any help.
- Totally, totally.
You're great at what you do.
You don't need me.
But, maybe I could learn from you.
You know?
Sort of shadow you for a while and see how your operation runs.
Go from bitch to boss, as it were.
Jake, you stop pushing it.
You're gonna make me think you're a snitch.
And you know what I do to snitches?
Give them a public dressing down?
Castrate them.
And then I kick 'em to death.
Cool cool, specific policy.
Love the attitude, love you, love all of this okay, see you in the mess hall, Romero.
Bye, Romero.
Hey, I'm in a bind.
I need your help.
- That's what friends are for.
- Well, "friends" might be a bit of a stretch.
I mean, you're a cannibal - that ate six people.
- 9 1/2.
Yup, worse.
All right, here are my options: A, I keep pestering Romero to tell me where the drugs are, he realizes I'm a snitch, then he castrates me - and kicks me to death.
- That's not great.
- What's option B?
- I back off Romero, never find out where the drugs are, the warden tells everyone I'm a snitch, and then Romero castrates me - and kicks me to death.
- Mm, both options sound A little castrate-y?
Yeah, that's what I keep - bumping up against too.
- Well, you know, whenever I'm backed into a corner, I just do what I do best: I drive across country, forge a new identity, and then take a job as a camp counselor.
Oh, my God.
Caleb, you're a genius.
I wouldn't say genius.
That camp ran a pretty extensive background check.
No, not that your past is a straight-up nightmare, but I need to do "what I do best": be a cop, work the case, figure out where the drugs are on my own.
And you tell the warden, and the warden will - bust Romero.
- And Romero won't think I'm a snitch, because he never told me where they are.
All right, this is gonna be tough.
I'm really gonna have to thread the needle.
Ooh!
I got really good at threading needles.
Back when you were making your skin suit, I know.
Look, I like being friends with you, but you have to - stop bringing that up.
- But we're friends?
Moving $5 million in diamonds is not an everyday activity, so Hawkins must be altering her behavior.
She's not.
I've been tailing her for days.
Scully and I went out to Flaxton Hill Farms to watch the guy who testified for Hawkins.
All he does is feed his pigs.
They eat seven or eight meals a day sometimes by force.
They're living the dream.
You know they get slaughtered.
- Worth it.
- Hey, I think I found something interesting.
I was double-checking last month's surveillance photos, and I noticed this.
Hawkins has two different phones: her normal cell, and then this one that only has one app on the home screen Snapchat.
Oh, she's up to something.
Snapchat messages disappear.
You can send anything to anybody, and after they see it, it's like I never sent it.
Nobody ask Hitchcock why he knows that.
Could we put a mirroring app on her phone so we could watch everything she does?
Oh, those work great, but you have to physically have her phone to install it.
Nobody ask Hitchcock why he knows that.
I know how we can get Hawkins' phone.
We get her to visit prison.
They make you leave your phone in your car.
I wanted to record Jake for the podcast, but they said I couldn't.
I had to have Terry on - as a guest.
- I gave up my Saturday for that.
You said I did great.
I'm the host.
I have to say that.
So, all we need to do is get Hawkins to visit someone in prison.
No, absolutely not.
What would I even say to her?
Well, perhaps you could ask her to put in a good word for you with the warden, - so you can get extra yard time.
- So, you want me to beg the woman I hate for mercy.
Cool.
Oh, one problem.
How do I stop myself from smashing through the glass and squeezing the life out of her with my bare hands?
Maybe you could just imagine doing that.
It'd be probably just as fun as actually doing it, right?
- No.
- I'm with Diaz.
Imagination is never the solution.
We just need three minutes to get inside her car and install the app.
Okay.
I can grovel for three minutes.
- But one second more - Yes, yes, we know.
You burst through the glass and squeeze the life out of her with your bare hands.
Well I think we have a plan.
Don't let them see us.
Blend in.
I gotta tell you, cop work is a lot like cannibal work.
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.
The watching the following The waiting for soccer practice to end.
Come on, man.
Did you see that?
Romero just went into the showers for the second time today.
Well, maybe he just likes to relax.
No one is relaxed in a prison shower.
It's literally the most tense situation I've ever been in.
What's he doing in there?
That must be where he stashes the Blizz.
Unless he's just having sex no, but he's a huge homophobe.
It's where he stashes the Blizz.
But all homophobes are secretly gay.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
We'll check it out later, when he's done.
Hawkins must be through security by now.
Rosa promised us three minutes, tops.
We'll get the phone.
Captain Holt, can you distract the lot attendant?
I'm not Captain Holt.
I'm Joe Wozniak, here to see my girl in prison.
And, to help me pass as a straight Kevin's rose-shearing hat.
Little Rosa Diaz.
So, I hear you want me to put in a good word for you with the warden?
Yes.
"Yes," what?
Yes please.
I love this.
This is so much fun for me.
- Can I help you?
- I'm just trying to work up the nerve to see her.
- See who?
- My female wife, Crystal.
I was cheating on her with a waitress from Wing Sluts named Jamie-Lynn.
One night, when I was philandering, Crystal caught me kissing Jamie-Lynn's heavy breasts.
She flew into a rage, and now she's serving five years for aggravated assault.
- Hey, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, thanks, man.
Hey.
Bring it in?
Oh That's the signal.
Go!
Oh, the phone!
- Pretty please?
- More.
- With sugar on top?
- More.
You should've seen Jamie-Lynn.
She looked exactly like "Maxim" Hot 100 honoree Jasmine Sanders.
35 seconds on the download.
It just seems like you wanna be with Jamie-Lynn.
I mean, you keep talking about her thigh gap.
That's my favorite part of a woman.
There's nothing more intoxicating than the clear absence of a penis.
But, you're right.
I need to forget about Crystal.
Thanks for the advice.
I'm off to plow my mistress.
More.
Time's up.
Diaz.
Hello?
Diaz!
You don't even beg well.
Have fun rotting in prison.
Okay.
Thanks for coming in.
So, you really think this is where Romero's stashing the drugs?
I mean, it's a good idea.
There's no cameras in here.
- What does Blizz look like?
- Like little white candies.
Oh, I love candies many say, to the point that it'll eventually kill me.
Hey, I found something.
Oh, twinsies.
What is this?
A melon baller?
Wait a minute.
Romero doesn't stash the drugs in here.
He comes in here to make the Blizz balls.
So, he brings a brick of drugs into the shower - without getting noticed?
- Yeah Oh, my God.
He smuggles the Blizz into the prison in - The soap dish.
- No, in the soap.
- It's in the soap.
- Oh, yeah!
That's much better.
I get it.
I did it!
I cracked the case!
Hey, you don't think you can get high from rubbing drugs on, like, your eyes and armpits and up under your b-parts, can you?
Whoop, you definitely can.
Here it comes.
Whoa-oh-oh, Caleb!
And you know what else I think are you listening?
Huh?
Are you, Mr. Warden?
I think we should be able to decorate our own cells, don't you?
I mean, choose our own wallpaper, laminated flooring, crown molding my friend Charles loves crown molding.
He says if it doesn't have the crown, - you have to vote it down.
- Are you on drugs?
Yes, and you should too, you know?
Get on my level.
Because quite frankly, we're not on the same wavelength, At agg at agg, at agg.
That's weird, I can't say the word "agg" anymore.
Yup, you've done a ton of Blizz.
Yes, Blizz!
That's why I'm here.
Wait, why am I here?
- Blizz.
- Yes!
Romero is smuggling the Blizz into the prison as bars of soap.
Interesting.
Hey, that's good work.
I know!
I am the smartest man of agg time!
"Agg time".
Agg time!
Agg time!
That was it.
Oh, man, I have a lot of energy.
Wait, no I'm exhausted.
I wonder if I can touch the ceiling.
Peralta.
Rombargo.
Where were you with that guard?
Great question.
When is Hawkins gonna unlock her phone?
We've been staring at her stupid face - for 14 hours.
- I don't mind.
This is a dead end.
Maybe I should call Seamus Murphy before it's too late.
I thought we agreed that's a bad idea.
What other options do we have?
There is still the podcast.
Guys, she unlocked the phone.
She's in the app and she's typing.
"Diamond emoji in locker 805.
Bus station, Linden, NJ.
Pickup 5:15".
We have one hour.
Let's move.
Answer the question.
Why were you coming out of the admin wing - with a guard?
- Um Okay, Jake!
Don't freak out.
Just stay calm.
You're on a crazy amount of Blizz, but your brain still works.
The warden was yelling at me.
- Are you on Blizz?
- What?
What makes you think that?
'Cause you just told us.
Okay, Jake.
Don't freak out.
Just stay calm.
You're on a crazy amount of Blizz, but your brain still works.
Yep, I am nips-deep in Blizz.
Nice.
I was worried you were still a cop, but what kind of cop does that much meth?
Well, no, no, not meth.
Blizz.
Yeah, that's meth.
We just call it Blizz 'cause meth has a bit of an image problem.
Oh!
Oh, my God, I guess I'm addicted to meth.
No, I'm not.
I just love it and I am consumed with the thought of doing it again.
So, now I know I can trust you, huh?
I can tell you how I smuggle in the Blizz.
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to tell me that.
- I don't even wanna know.
- As bars of soap.
Oh.
- Smart.
- Congratulations.
You're one of only two people who know.
Ah that's great.
Glad to be part of such an elite group.
You know what?
I think my Blizz is wearing off.
- I should probably go lie down.
- Yeah.
The diarrhea's coming.
That is very common.
Don't let the volume scare you.
Wait.
Volume as in noise or amount?
Oh, God, it's both, isn't it?
Okay, I've got eyes on locker 805.
I'm within sight of both exits.
Copy that.
It's almost five.
- Where's Boyle?
- Shalom, Amy.
Charles, what are you doing?
Taking this undercover mission seriously.
- Seems like I'm the only one.
- It's a bus station.
We don't need disguises.
Anyone can be here.
Typical shiksa.
I see movement at the locker.
He's opening 805!
Let's go!
NYPD!
Get down!
- Down!
- Drop your bag.
No diamonds, just this.
- Hello?
- It's Hawkins.
When will you learn that you will never beat me?
You're not gonna get away with this.
- We're gonna take you down.
- It's over, Holt.
Checkmate.
Knight's bishop to queen five.
Buh-bye now.
She set us up.
Oy vey.
- What do you want, Peralta?
- Stop everything.
Romero told me that the Blizz is in the soap.
If you take away his supply, he'll know I'm the snitch - and kill me.
- Nah, sorry.
I already made the report to my bosses, and they were very pleased.
Glen couldn't stop smiling.
Glen?
You don't know what a big deal that is.
Anyway, you're too late.
We're confiscating all of Romero's soap - as we speak.
- Okay, how about this?
Throw me in solitary.
Right?
That way, Romero can't get to me.
No, Glen's already coming down on me about giving too much solitary.
And I don't wanna piss off Glen.
- Obviously.
- What if I spit on you?
You're the warden, right?
That's gotta be at least a month in the hole.
Oh, man, my mouth is all dried out from doing the meth.
That's why you don't do meth.
Ah, oh, no, no!
Don't tase me, man!
Remember that?
So funny but don't.
I don't understand.
How did she know we were mirroring her phone?
We had one chance, and we blew it!
I know you're upset, but it's really hard to take you seriously when you still look like that.
I used Broadway-caliber spirit gum.
This baby is fused to my cheeks.
Squad, I think I'm onto something.
I was listening to an episode of Boyle's podcast.
Not the one Terry was on, I hope.
No, of course not.
That one was problematic.
What did I do that was so wrong?
It was the episode about Flaxton Hill Farms.
The part where Scully said the pigs were being force-fed.
These pigs weigh more than 200 pounds, which means they're finishing pigs.
And why would a farmer force-feed a finishing pig?
I don't know what finishing pigs are.
- Me neither.
- I'm totally lost.
Because he was feeding them something other than food!
The diamonds!
She's moving them inside the pigs!
Let's move.
- I still don't get it.
- Nobody does.
They're just pretending.
I can't believe this.
I'm gonna die in here, and then you're gonna eat my castrated body.
I guess, but it'd be a pretty boring meal - without dessert.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Romero's headed towards us.
- And he looks angry.
- Well, he always looks angry.
Maybe it's not directed at you.
No, now he's pointing at you.
- This is bad.
- Yeah, I know it's bad.
The warden took my entire stash of soap.
Apparently, someone told him it was Blizz.
And you want me to help you figure out who it was.
- Well, it was Tank.
- No, it wasn't.
Yeah, it wasn't Tank.
It was me.
Tank, I came clean and saved your life.
- Now you owe me.
- No I don't.
I told you what I do to snitches.
- Hold it, Romero.
- Caleb, what are you doing?
It's okay, Jake.
I got this.
Peralta is my best friend.
If you wanna kill him, you're gonna have to kill me first, because friendship Oh, my God, he stabbed me, Jake!
Everybody, get on the ground!
- Now!
- You're next, Peralta.
You better sleep with one eye open.
Ow, ow, ow, ow.
He poked me in my tummy.
Are you sure?
I need you to be sure.
You were right.
Pigs' stomachs were full of diamonds.
That's it.
Everyone on the ground!
- Put down your weapons!
- You're being recorded for a podcast!
You will sign a consent form.
- What's going on here?
- We found the diamonds and Langdon confessed.
It's over, Hawkins.
Pawn to king square five, king's knight to the third square on the bishop's file, queen takes on F7!
Checkmate!
Now, that's a chess move.
Buh-bye now.
Peralta.
Warden.
Your squad busted Melanie Hawkins.
What?
You're getting out.
Come with me.
Okay.
Wait.
Can I do one thing first?
I wanted to say good-bye.
I can't believe you saved my life.
I would not do it again.
- It really hurt.
- Yeah but you did do it.
And I regret it so much.
Caleb, you're ruining this.
Look, I just wanted to say thank you for everything.
You got me through this.
I'm gonna miss you.
Aww.
Put her there, pal.
Guards, guards!
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm Nine-Nine welcome to Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz!
- Ah, it's so good to be back.
- Amen, brother.
Can I buy a free man a drink?
I'd rather have a drink of that mouth.
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry, I just - I love you.
- I love you too.
Hello, I'm also back.
- Hey, Rosa.
- So, I heard you spent some time in solitary.
Pretty dope, right?
Uh Scar, Sarabi and I didn't see you at the presentation of Simba.
Oh, Mufasa, did I miss it?
That's simply awful.
I handled it well.
Sir, I can't believe your obscure knowledge of pig-feeding charts saved us.
How did you even think of that?
Frankly, I'm embarrassed it took so long.
I should've realized the second I saw those hogs.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- So, Captain Holt, did my information prove useful?
Were the diamonds in the pigs?
- Yes, you were right.
- Good.
And now you owe me a favor.
And don't even think about screwing me.
Captain, we're doing toasts.
Everyone, raise your drinks!
the 99th precinct is officially all back together!
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Okay, we're all set up in there, Mr. Peralta.
Just sign here.
What's all set up?
What's going on?
Ah, thank you for asking, Terrence.
You see, the food in prison was inedible.
All I thought about day and night were the things I wished I was eating.
And you, Amy.
I thought about you a lot.
Sex with you, just, us doing sex with foreplay.
Great save, babe.
Thanks.
And so I decided to make my food fantasy come true.
Unbutton your pants and take off your shoes, 'cause there's gonna be a doinkload of sodium at Freedom Feast 2017.
We begin where all great stories begin.
In the quaint little town of French Fry Village.
After that, we're gonna move our adventure over to Cheeseburger Mountain, which consists you guessed it of turkey burgers.
I'm kidding, it's cheeseburgers.
This is kind of just stuffing.
You can avoid that.
But it's attached to the Thanksgiving turkey theme 'cause I was thinking about that a lot up in the jail.
And finally, we have a big old Passover brisket 'cause you know I loves my mom.
If you would all take a seat while I make a toast.
Kindly raise your two liters.
To freedom, to you, and most importantly, to orange drank.
And sex with Amy.
To sex with Amy!
Sorry.
Shouldn't have said that last part.
-  - Oink, oink.
Good morning, sir.
Your expression is inscrutable as always.
And yours is extremely scrutable.
You want something.
A video game, perhaps?
Or a fidget spinner?
I do want both of those things, but that's not why I'm here.
I'm back and I'm ready for a case, so what do you got?
A murder?
A sui?
A murder-sui?
They often follow one another.
Ooh, maybe you've got an avunculicide up in there?
The murder of an uncle.
I'm surprised you know what that word means.
I learned about a lot of new crimes in prison.
Those people real bad.
You know you can't work a case yet.
You've been assigned to desk duty.
Oh, please.
Don't make me sit behind a desk all day.
That's worse than prison.
No, it's not.
Prison real bad.
Those are the rules for anyone experiencing a traumatic work-lapse.
It wasn't that traumatic.
You just said, and I quote, "Prison real bad".
Look, I'm ready.
I'm the same old Jake.
I don't know why you have an issue with this.
Rosa was happy to comply.
So, what, now I'm just supposed to do anything that Rosa does?
I mean, what if she jumped off a cliff?
If Rosa were to jump off a cliff, she would've done her due diligence regarding the height of the cliff, the depth of the water, and the angle of entry, so yes.
If you see Rosa jump off a cliff, by all means.
Jump off a cliff.
You jump off a cliff.
Gladly.
Provided Rosa did first.
Hey.
Babe.
You forgot your lunch at home.
Aww, thanks Adrian.
You're the sweetest.
Aww, of course.
I French kissed every slice of meat in that sandwich.
Pimento, welcome back.
How was Argentina?
Eh, it was kind of boring, actually.
Although, one funny thing did happen to me.
-  - Still feels like you and I have a different idea about what a funny thing is.
Right?
Anyway.
I should boogie.
What?
Say good-bye to mommy.
Ooh, don't mind if I do.
All right, I'm just gonna look over here.
- Okay.
I'm doing that thing.
- Man.
- I think it's still happening.
- I'm still hearing it.
Phew!
Hang on.
Were you creeps watching that the whole time?
- Well - Uh I'm just kidding.
I know you were.
It's like an eclipse.
You should always look at it with both eyes wide open.
Full on.
You're welcome.
I love you, babe.
- Love you too.
- Yeah!
Must be so nice having Pimento back.
I mean, you shouldn't eat that sandwich.
Something's wrong.
He's acting weird - Er than normal?
- Yes.
He's not telling me something.
You guys did spend several months apart.
Maybe it's all in your head.
Oh.
Bitches be crazy, is that what you're saying, Terry?
What?
No, no.
I did not say that.
I would never say that.
Not cool, Terry.
My relationship's in trouble.
Terry loves women!
Women be sane!
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, desk brother.
I don't think so.
This is just temporary.
That's what I said.
Join us, Jake.
You know you want to.
We're going to Wingsluts.
My God.
Charles!
Charles, Charles, Charles!
What's wrong?
Going crazy over here, man.
The only worthwhile thing I've done today was take a Buzzfeed quiz about what kind of onion I am.
Hm.
Vidalia.
Ah.
Cipollini.
That was not the point of my story.
- Oh.
- Desk duty is a nightmare.
Name one thing someone accomplished while sitting behind a desk.
Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery.
Yeah, but think about how much faster he would've done it if he'd got off his ass once in a while, right?
Well, just tell me what you're working on, huh?
Before the stapling starts again, please?
Please?
- I don't know if I should.
- Charles, Charles, Charles!
I need this, man.
Just give me a little taste.
- Grand larceny.
- No!
- Ow!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
I just I love grand larceny.
I know.
I didn't wanna bring it up.
It'll never happen again, just Who got robbed?
- Sneaker store.
- I hope you die!
- Ah!
- Oh!
That was way too harsh.
Charles, forgive me.
This is crazy, right?
It doesn't seem fair.
I should be working this case.
Yeah.
I will work this case.
There's gotta be a way to fix it.
and I'm gonna figure it out.
- Are you serious?
- Yes.
Yeah!
Wow, throwing your file all over the place, Charles?
- Really immature.
- Yeah, you're right.
I'll go clean it up.
Well, figured out what's off with Pimento.
He's cheating on me.
-  No.
- Oh, Rosa.
I found his credit card statement.
There's a charge for a restaurant called La Palapa.
Two entrees.
One flan.
- One flan?
- One flan.
- That's cold.
- Yeah.
Cold.
I'm so confused.
They shared the flan!
Okay, but That seems like a bit of a stretch.
Nope.
When it comes to cheating, you gotta pay attention to all the signs.
During my year abroad in Japan, I learned that the hard way.
Chiaki There was no Japanese tea sock.
But there was a Japanese man.
I wasted a year on Chiaki.
So, what should I do?
Maybe don't jump to conclusions.
No!
Interrogate him!
Follow the flan, Rosa.
Follow the flan.
Right.
Follow the flan.
Guess what I'm holding behind my back?
Before we begin, what are the parameters of the guessing game?
How many guesses do I get?
Is there a time limit?
Forget it.
You ruin everything.
It's the police code and ethics manual.
Chapter four.
Page 83.
You should not have told me.
I never would've guessed it.
Now I've won.
This.
This is what I've missed.
It clearly states that I can get off of desk duty if I pass a field evaluation performed by a member of the Municipal Police Training Council.
That's right.
It's a loophole.
Loophole high five.
-  Loop - Hole.
- Loop - Hole!
Enough.
This is highly inappropriate.
Did you also see where it states, "If you fail the evaluation, you will be suspended"?
I would have to take your gun and badge.
I'm not worried about that.
I swear to my personal Lord and Savior, Steph Curry, I'm ready.
I think you're rushing.
It's a bad idea.
Doesn't matter.
I'm allowed to demand my own evaluation.
Yes, but as your commanding officer, I choose the evaluator.
And I choose Me.
Wait.
What?
I'm a qualified member of the MPTC.
I'll administer it.
All right.
Fine.
I'll pass your dumb evaluation and crack this case.
Bring it on.
- I will.
- Good.
- Good.
- You're good.
But I'm better.
And I'm gonna ace this thing before you can even Oh, wait, wait, what are you writing down?
Sir?
What are you writing down?
Charles  What's he writing?
- Write something good.
- Write something good.
We're just gonna leave.
Just stop writing.
- Just stop writing.
- Stop writing.
- Unless it's good.
- No.
- Is it good?
- Is it good?
We're gonna go.
Sir?
Write something good.
Write something good.
It looks like the perp knew what he was after.
All he took was a shipment of thousand dollar limited edition Weezies designed by Little Wayne.
Oh, it's Lil.
- Oh, like Lillian.
- No.
Lillian Wayne.
Okay.
Okay.
Captain, I hope you're wearing your evaluating pants, 'cause I'm about to put on a crime solving clinic.
I am wearing my evaluating pants.
What?
'Cause I was just Wait, what are evaluating pants?
They have a deep bottom pocket for my notepad, and they don't crease, which is a must, given how much I squat during an evaluation.
Mmkay, well there were no witnesses to the crime, which is weird since there was a long line of sneaker-heads right outside the window, and you're actually squatting.
Just, uh, ignore me.
Unless you can't.
It's not a problem.
I love ignoring you.
Don't write that down.
But continuing with the case, There were no signs of forced entry.
- Hm.
- No fingerprints.
- Hmm.
- And no DNA evidence.
- Hmm.
- Okay, I can't ignore you.
What are you writing down there?
Probably that you're crushing it, Jake, because you are crushing it.
Are you trying to squat a peek?
Of course I'm trying to squat a peek, but I also might be solving the case.
Charles, come take a look at this there's a security camera across the street we didn't see before.
I have a feeling our answers are in that footage.
- Squat five.
-  - Too far.
- I'll move closer.
- Still too far.
- A little closer.
- Getting closer.
- There we go.
-  - Worth it.
I followed the flan.
I confronted Pimento about La Palapa and he lied to me.
He denied ever even hearing about the restaurant.
- Hmm, that is strange.
- And this morning, he left the house in clean clothes.
- He never does that.
- Never?
You need to follow him.
Catch him with his spoon in the flan.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
I need to check out a full surveillance kit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's against the rules.
Sarge?
There are no rules when it comes to cheating, Amy.
I totally agree.
But unfortunately, the NYPD does not.
I can't lend you department equipment for personal use.
But there may be a work-around.
Hitchcock!
You have any surveillance equipment Rosa can borrow?
You mean my creep kit?
No prob.
Got another one in the car.
See, Amy?
That's what a real friend looks like.
Okay.
Security footage came in.
Let's see what we got.
Probably a huge break.
Well, let's not put too much pressure on it.
You're right.
It's probably a dead end.
- Also not helpful.
- Let's just watch the footage.
Yes.
Great.
All right, so, here we have the camped-out line of sneaker-heads.
Not much going on around midnight.
- Let's just fast-forward.
- It's okay.
Still pretty calm at around 1:00 a.m. - That's all right.
- Fast forward.
And also looking a little bit slow around 3:00 a.m. So, basically it shows nothing.
Or Does it show everything?
Ooh!
Sorry not sorry.
It was just a stupid pencil.
It was a gift from my deceased father.
A pencil?
Your dad gave pretty bad gifts.
Although on the other hand, all my dad ever gave me was abandonment issues, so, potato-tomato.
But look at this.
Right around 4:00 a.m., the line moves down.
Everyone except for that blue pup tent, which is interesting.
Oh, my boy's got a hunch.
He's got bunches of hunches.
I think they didn't move down because they didn't care about their place in line.
I believe all they cared about was the placement of their tent, which was Right over this manhole cover.
And I wonder what's behind this.
Hayouken!
Oh, look.
It's the sneaker store stock room.
Whoa.
How does he do it, folks?
It was a team effort, Boyle.
- Humble five?
- You know it.
Uh, I couldn't possibly.
Of course we still have no idea who was in the blue pup tent.
You know what?
There is no pleasing you.
That is accurate.
What do you want?
- Hey.
- Hi, Rosa.
How's the Pimento stake out going?
Has he done anything suspicious yet?
No.
Just regular Pimento stuff.
Ugh.
It's like he's going all norm-core to through me off the scent.
Or maybe it could be Pimento wasn't cheating on you.
What?
You sound like a real Amy right now.
- Hey.
- I know, but even a broken Amy can be right twice a day.
Hey!
We went to lunch at La Palapa and we shared the flan.
Oh, so you two are boning now?
No!
The flan's huge.
Everyone shares it.
- The restaurant tells you to.
- Hmm.
Maybe it's time to put the creep kit away, Rosa.
Wait.
Pimento just walked up to a woman.
A female woman?
Rosa, is it a female woman?
They just kissed.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry, Rosa.
Whatever.
Hope you enjoyed the flan.
So, what's this about a giant flan?
The manager at the store recognized the pup tent from two previous sneaker launches.
And he ID'd the owner as one Morris Richman.
Who just so happens to work for Con Ed, on underground electrical wires.
He also just so happens to live a-right a-here.
You might wanna squat for this, Mr. Evaluator.
I decide when the squatting is necessary.
This was my choice.
- Can I help you?
- NYPD.
Are you Morris Richman?
- Yes.
- And are those Weezies?
Yes.
- Well done, Peralta.
- Thank you.
But it wasn't me.
It was Steph Working through me.
What is going on?
Oh, he's been evaluating me.
It's been up and down, but this is a clear win.
Oh, sorry, you mean what's going on with you?
You're under arrest for grand larceny.
I didn't do anything.
Is this about the Weezies?
A friend gave them to me.
I'm innocent.
Come on, man, I'm innocent.
Sure you are, buddy.
We all know you did it.
Charles!
- We arrested the wrong guy.
- What?
Morris Richman didn't do it.
We have to fix this right now.
I'll wait for you to not be naked.
This is really bad, Charles.
Jake, can you please spiral a little quieter?
Nikolaj is still asleep and if he hears two men arguing in the next room, he might think he's getting sold again.
Aww, man, his backstory is so sad.
- I know.
- Look.
I don't know how I screwed this up, I mean, maybe Holt got in my head with all of his squatting.
- It was a powerful image.
- I think I rushed this all so I could pass the evaluation.
Bottom line, we arrested the wrong guy.
What about the pup tent?
And the manhole?
And he was wearing Weezies.
Maybe his friend gave them to him just like he said.
-  - We have no physical evidence tying him to the stock room.
Plus, where are the rest of the sneakers?
Okay.
So, do we tell Captain Holt?
No.
Then he'll fail me and I'll get suspended.
We gotta solve this on our own.
And I think I know how.
I found a lead on the dark web.
Nice.
The dark web.
It's the only place you can buy quality bat meat.
Mm.
Gross.
Anyways, I posted a message looking for Weezies and I got pointed to MizzBK-Sneaks.
She put this pic up yesterday.
Ah.
Those are our stolen shoes.
But who's MizzBK-Sneaks?
Her name is Jenny McFadden.
She moves her merch out of the back of a bodega on Willoughby.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
All right, one problem.
If we go to the bodega looking like detectives, we'll spook her.
Right you are, Charles my chum.
But we won't look like detectives.
I brought all my best sneakers.
Get your fat, sweaty feet ready.
Yeah.
We're gonna look flippity-dippity-fly.
Hey.
So, you doing okay?
Not really.
I waited outside that restaurant for two hours and he never came out.
Cantaloupe?
I'm good.
Amy?
Also good.
Also good.
I spent the whole night riding my bike, just thinking and riding, riding and thinking.
Also, I drank some water from the stream.
And what did you figure out?
I'm gonna dump his ass.
He should be here any minute.
Oh, you're gonna do it at work.
That's great.
There you are.
Babe, I've been looking for you all night.
You didn't come home.
'Cause I knew if I did, I would stab you in the face.
Oh, Terry, we have the thing in the other room.
- Mm-hmm.
- Phone Yeah.
Meeting.
Uh, work.
Friend lunch.
Yep.
So is this a sexy stab in the face?
Or an angry stab in the face?
-  - Don't play dumb with me.
I know about your mistress.
I know about La Palapa.
I know about the flan.
- Babe, wait.
- Oh, I've been waiting.
I waited all night to do this.
We're done.
It's over.
What?
No.
I don't have a mistress.
That woman's name is SeÃ±ora Reyes.
She's my Spanish teacher.
- Oh, please.
- No, I'm serious.
The only reason we were even at La Palapa was so I can practice ordering in Spanish.
Ah by the way It did?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Adrian, I'm so sorry.
You must be so mad at me.
What?
No, of course I'm not mad at you.
Are you kidding?
Jealousy's, like, the hottest emotion.
Let's do this.
Okay, let's do it.
All right.
This guy looks like the gatekeeper.
- Just follow my lead.
- Okay.
-  - Hey, how are ya?
Just grabbing a couple things.
Ham puffs, a single tampon, and a hot rod magazine?
- Know how we do.
- Ahh.
Hey, listen, we're looking to score some kicks.
You know where we can find some?
Yeah.
The mall.
The mall.
What do we look like, Jay and Silent Bob?
Actually, yeah.
Fair enough.
Look, we're friends with Jenny McFadden.
Okay.
Well, if that's true, tell me what her favorite shoe is.
Old school Impala All-Stars.
- Okay.
I'll go get her.
- Great.
I can't believe that worked.
I just guessed the coolest shoe I knew and I was right.
Nope, he's running away.
Ugh, these shoes are so uncomfortable!
They're dress sneakers, you're not supposed to run in them.
Freeze!
NYPD.
Let me see your hands.
I didn't do anything.
Then why were you running?
I didn't want any trouble.
I have two priors.
Where is Jenny McFadden?
There is no Jenny McFadden.
That's a cover for the dude who steals the shoes.
His name is Morris Richman.
Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Why are you freaking out?
This is great.
You were right all along.
It was Morris Richman.
You'll definitely pass your evaluation now.
Yeah, the only thing is You let Morris Richman go?
Single tampon?
I am in shock, Peralta.
I can't believe you released Morris Richman.
We have evidence.
Great evidence that Jake found.
Exactly, which makes it even worse that he let him go.
That's not fair.
I was trying to help, but he tricked me.
You blew this case.
You bungled your evaluation, and you never retrieved my father's pencil.
Sir, I am happy to get you a new pencil.
It won't be the same.
And now you're just standing here, mum as a mouse.
Have you nothing to say for yourself?
- I can explain.
- Of course he can.
My boy's got bunches of explunches.
Hit 'em, Jake.
I'm not ready to be back.
- You should suspend me.
- What?
Look, when we arrested Richman and he said he didn't do it, I just I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I mean, what if he was telling the truth?
What if he was innocent and I was putting an innocent man in jail?
It's just Feels a lot harder for me to put another human being in prison after experiencing it myself.
It's really horrible.
Look, I wanted to be back in the field, because I wanted to be the old me, but the truth is, I'm not the old me yet.
Maybe I never will be.
Anyways, I'm gonna go cry in the bathroom.
Peace out, homies.
Hey.
What's going on?
I thought everything worked out.
Is there a reason you're still upset?
What makes you think I'm upset?
The giant hole you carved into the table.
Oops.
Didn't notice.
There.
Fixed it.
Look, I get it.
You feel guilty about accusing him of cheating.
That's on me.
I encouraged you because of all my unresolved Chiaki issues.
No, it's not that, it's just Last night, when I ended things with Adrian, I had this huge feeling of relief.
It's the first time in a long time that I felt like myself again.
Oh, Rosa.
I think I got so worked up about him cheating on me because I wanted it to be true.
I needed an excuse to end things.
And now I don't know what to do.
I think you do know what to do.
Thanks, Amy.
I have no idea what she's gonna do but that's the safest way to give Rosa advice.
Yep.
Packing your desk.
That's a major downer.
Yeah, so why are you smiling like that?
We found Morris Richman.
Nuh-uh, Jake found him.
We talked about this, Boyle.
We agreed that if you couldn't keep it together, you couldn't be a part of this.
I'll be good.
We went through your case file, and everything we needed was there.
Richman's aliases, his known associates, and an address in Queens that he used as a safe house.
The 2-7 just picked him up.
Tell him the other stuff.
Tell him.
Tell him now.
Yeah.
I can't be here.
When you demanded to be put back on the field, I worried that you were being flippant about your time in prison.
I thought you would be reckless, but I was wrong.
Prison has made you more cautious.
Yeah, but what if I'm too cautious now?
I mean, I used to see everything as black and white, and now, it's looking real gray to me.
I wish every cop had a voice in their head asking, what if he's innocent?
You see it as weakness, but it means you're growing.
It makes you a better detective.
So, you passed your evaluation.
You can go back in the field.
Oh.
Wow.
Thank you for passing me.
But I actually feel like I need a little bit more time to readjust.
I think I should ride the desk for a few more weeks.
I respect that.
Okay, Charles, you can come hug us now.
We know you're still there.
- I never left.
- Ugh!
Thank you for understanding.
Yeah.
Oh.
Look.
Oh, boy.
- Here's your blood back.
- Mm.
Well, in that case, I guess you should have your blood back too.
What?
How did you get this?
You know, I might want a couple minutes up here alone.
Just to kinda process this, you know.
Of course.
So, how'd it go?
It actually went surprisingly well -  -   No!
Rosa!
Honestly, this is the best I could've asked for.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1   Halloween.
Mua-ha-ha-ha.
It's heist time.
- Dah!
- Thought you could get a head start on heist prep?
Good luck.
I'm already dressed.
Well I'm also dressed, and I made breakfast.
- Wait, where are my eggs?
- In my belly.
Now get a move on.
It's heist time.
I love Halloween!
Some of you have asked me what got me through prison.
Was it my family?
Don't be stupid.
Was it knowing that my friends would eventually get me out?
Of course not, I never believed in any of you.
No, the only thing that kept me sane was planning for the Halloween heist those many years doing hard time.
- It was eight weeks.
- I also went to prison, dog.
- We're getting off track here.
- No, we're not, dog.
Peralta's just trying to play the sympathy card so we all go easy on him.
I'd rather send you back to prison - than see you win.
- Okay.
This year, we compete for the most elegant and regal of all prizes A championship cummerbund.
Or belt, as normal people call it.
Belt I'd like to see the pair of slacks whose loops are large enough for this belt.
No, it is a cummerbund.
- Well, whatever it is - Cummerbund.
It's inscribed with the words, "Amazing human/genius".
The objective is to have it in your possession at midnight.
This year, the competition is not limited - to winners of the past heists.
- That's right.
Any man, or woman #Resist can enter.
- It's open to everyone.
- Ooh, every man for himself.
It's like "Bachelor in Paradise".
It's really cool that you guys opened it up to anyone.
Thanks.
Yeah, we talked about it, and we just felt like it was only fair.
I was being sarcastic.
You all suck, and I hope Jake goes back to jail.
Oh, cool, I'm glad everyone feels comfortable joking about that.
- Not joking.
- Insult me all you want, for I have only this to say  Victory shall be mine!
I heard you practicing in the shower.
You can't surprise me.
Letting me into your life was the worst mistake you ever made.
Cool, fun take on our relationship.
Well, I for one thing you're perfect for each other Feel like there's gonna be more.
- Because you're both losers.
- There it is.
None of you stand a chance against me.
No courage, no patience, no brains, and, of course, a bald old man.
I'm younger than you.
No comeback for the bald thing, I see.
Yeah, I'm not doing the heist.
I'm out.
-  - Okay.
- Bull crap.
- Yeah, right.
Just like you were out last year.
- I was out last year.
- As a setup for this year.
You're good, Jeffords, but not good enough.
In fact, you're an idiot.
I should've fired you long ago.
- What?
- Relax, Terry, chill out.
Get your undies out of your buns.
Now, if everyone would rise.
Rise like the army of the dead, and follow me into the bullpen of destiny.
This heist, the belt will not be locked up or hidden away.
It will be suspended from the ceiling in plain sight - for all to see.
- How poetic.
It will hang just out of reach, like Tantalus's fruit.
Yes, that's where I got the inspiration from, Greek mythology, not an episode of the Nickelodeon show "Guts".
Amy, will you please do the honors?
Mm-hmm.
- The belt is in place.
- Whoever has it at midnight - will be declared the -  -  - What's going on?
- What's happening?
- I can't see!
Everybody just grab something random.
Back off, Hitchcock.
Silence!
It's gone.
The cummerbund is gone!
Who took it?
We're all here.
Where'd it go?
Nowhere.
It's still in this room.
In fact, it's right here!
Nope, it's just your tum-tum.
I don't have the cummerbund, because it's right here!
Or is it right here?
Everybody stop undressing.
We just had harassment training.
Hey over here, losers.
This is Gina Linetti.
You really thought you could do this without me?
I'm the defending champion.
Gina I should have known it was you, you punk.
Yeah, you punk, why aren't you showing your face, you punk?
Yeah, I just had a baby.
I haven't washed my hair in three weeks.
Oh, how is she?
- Yeah, how's she doing?
- None of your business.
Now, if you wanna find the belt, you're gonna have to work for it.
Behind my desk are boxes of baby stuff that I didn't wanna assemble.
You get a clue for each item you put together.
Linetti, Lin-out-ti.
This is crazy.
I mean, no one is actually gonna do Gina's dumb chores, right?
Right, absolutely not.
It's completely ridiculous.
I got the reach-and-play!
You can all suck it!
- They fell for it.
- Hook, line, and sphincter.
- It's sinker.
- No, it's sphincter.
That's where you put the hook in when you're eeling.
Well, I never use that expression again.
- Hey, guys.
- Ah.
- And right on time, here's Bill.
- Welcome.
Man, it is amazing how similar you guys look.
- I don't see it.
- Me neither.
- Not even a little.
- Not at all.
Twins.
So, did you have any issues - getting into the vents?
- Went like clockwork.
Sir, only authorized personnel are allowed up here.
Oh, Detective Boyle, didn't see it was you.
Get better eyes, you moron.
Ah, man, I'm friends with Officer Lou.
Not anymore.
He was very upset.
Anyway, once I got in the vents, it was smooth sailing.
The belt is in place.
Whoever has it at midnight will be declared the winner - of the fifth annual -  - What's going on?
- What's happening?
I can't see!
Everyone just grab something randomly.
Back off, Hitchcock.
Hey, over here, losers.
I gotta say, Bill, your Gina impression was spot-on.
I'm very good at roleplay, and I'm super comfortable wearing masks.
Right, I forgot you were maybe a male prostitute.
I was definitely a male prostitute, but I don't do that profession anymore.
Now I sell vitamin supplements.
I made $90,000 this year alone, working out of the comfort of my own home.
- Uh-huh?
- How did I do it?
- NutriBoom.
- Right.
And the good news is, you can do it too.
Okay, this is clearly a pyramid scheme.
We're not interested.
Okay, your loss.
- Here's the belt - Ah - she's a beauty.
- Hi-yah!
Ow!
Charles, what are you doing?
The hardest thing I've EVER  betraying you.
Bill, the belt.
- Bill, you're in on this too?
- Yep.
Charles promised he'd buy a ton of supplements and become one of my downstream distributors.
No, look, listen to me, don't do this, okay?
I really need to win this year.
I'm begging you.
Those baby browns aren't gonna work on me, not today.
This is crazy.
You're never gonna get out of here with that belt on your own.
I'm not on my own.
I have an alliance.
An alliance.
It's not "Bachelor in Paradise".
It's "Survivor".
Rosa, I am very disappointed in you.
Your approval means nothing to me.
Copy that.
And Terry, I knew you were playing.
- Last year was a setup.
- Hell yeah, it was.
I'm sick of you, Amy, and Holt winning.
- You're all so damn smug.
- Yeah, you guys may be champs, but this year this year belongs to The Tramps.
- Charles, that's a bad name.
- Ha, you're just jealous.
- Everyone loves it.
- No.
- Nuh-uh.
- Bill, keep an eye on him.
Let's go, Tramps.
Charles, no!
No!
Hey, let me ask you this, how would you like to be your own boss?
Not now, Bill!
Amy!
Amy, in here!
In here.
Help.
- Hello, fake Charles.
- Hi.
Hello, tied-up Jake.
Will you please help me get out of this?
It's not for the heist.
I just really have to pee.
I know you don't drink water.
You pee once every two days.
- And you went this morning.
- Damn it, you know me so well.
All right, how about this?
I've got top secret info about various dealings.
If you let me out of these cuffs, - I'll share it with you.
- What kind of info?
Well, first off, Wolf Gina Was just a ruse so you and Charles could steal the belt.
Yeah-huh, but also Charles teamed up with Rosa and Terry to form The Tramps.
Gah!
How did you know that?
I gave Charles the idea last year.
Gina's one of the champs.
And I'm just one of the tramps.
Ooh, The Tramps.
That's a great name for something.
I just don't know what.
But I do.
I told you, I'll always be one step ahead of you.
You can't surprise me.
Ya boring.
You know what spices up a relationship?
Co-owning a multi-tiered marketing Ignore him.
Look, there are three Tramps.
The only way we're gonna win is if we team up.
Good point.
I guess my response is, - rot in hell, crap-face!
-  Also, I love you, and I treasure you, - and ya bore me.
- God, you're being so mean.
- Do it more.
- I hope you die.
-  - Bye.
Fine!
Go!
Who needs you, ya freakin' jag!
Looks like we're all clear.
Good job, guys.
Oh, nothing can stop this Tramp train.
Boyle, stop finding variations on a word we hate.
Okay, Sarge, lift up the super heavy thing that no one else is strong enough to lift.
Nice, Sarge!
Keep lifting heavy stuff like that, and maybe you'll work off some of that bulk, huh?
- What?
- I set up an electric eye yesterday, so if anyone enters this room, an alarm will go off.
Let's move.
Don't cross the beam.
Cool, yeah, that's something I can do, without any problem.
-  -  Alarm works.
All right, fine, looks like I'm gonna have to "127 Hours" this sitch.
- You're gonna cut off your own arm?
- Is that how it ends?
Oh, man, I got busy, and my rental period expired.
I thought he just wiggled out.
Come, will you just please un-cuff me?
Please, you gotta, man.
I've never treated you like a prostitute.
- You just did.
- TouchÃ©.
All right, how about this?
I will buy double the amount of supplements that Boyle did.
- $8,000?
- What?
He gave you 4 grand?
All right, fine, I'm in.
He didn't give it to me.
He invested it in his future.
- And you can too.
- Yeah, I already agreed to it.
- You don't have to keep selling me.
- Sorry, the script we're given anticipates a lot more resistance.
Okay, so let's get the paperwork started.
First things first, you are not allowed to have any of this reviewed by an attorney.
Yeah, this seems bad.
So, where on Gina's mobile should I place this moonless Jupiter?
I pity the child who lies beneath this solar system.
Hey, Captain, something's going on with this heist.
You tell us everything you know, and we'll tell you everything we know.
- I'd rather not.
-  Jokes on you, - we don't know anything.
- Well, good day then.
- Wait, why are you sweating?
- I'm not sweating.
No, I've had enough heart attacks to know what sweating looks like, and that's sweat.
Well, if I'm sweating, as you claim, it's because I was watching an exciting video on the net.
Really?
What?
It was a video of an American gymnast.
His leotard ripped, exposing his butt.
- It was highly erotic.
- You're lying.
I.T. just installed blocker software, - thanks to moi.
- Uh, yes, but they didn't install it on my computer, because I'm a captain.
You don't look hot and bothered at all to me.
- Show us the erotica.
- Gentlemen, I assure you, there's nothing to see.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to grab some fresh air.
Good boy, Cheddar.
Bring me that cummerbund.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute this isn't the championship cummerbund.
This is some common cummerbund.
And you're not Cheddar.
You're just some common bitch.
And this says you've received your sales training.
- Great.
- And this one is a sworn affidavit stating that you have seen Debbie Stovelman, the wife of NutriBoom founder, David Stovelman, and that you found her to be happy, healthy, and alive.
Okay, fine.
Great, all right, done.
Just get me out of these.
- Hey, what's going on here?
-   Yeah!
Didn't think I could get out of my cuffs, did you, Boyle?
But you forgot about one important thing - NutriBoom.
- NutriBoom!
That's right.
I'm in the President's Circle now.
Sorry, Charles, this year's heist was just too important.
- Watch him, Bill.
- Check in, Boyle, check in.
Uh-oh, Jake, they check in every ten minutes, and I have to respond with a code only we know.
- I am a Tramp.
- Copy that.
Did I guess it?
Did I guess the code?
I couldn't hear what Rosa said back, but was that right?
- You got it.
- Yeah, I thought so, okay.
Okay, security system, talk to me.
What have I missed?
What's going on?
Ah-ha!
Holt used Cheddar to steal the belt.
But that's not Cheddar.
Holt and Cheddar always walk in a perfect lockstep.
Which means someone took Cheddar, and that person has the belt.
But who?
Who took Cheddar?
- Where are you coming from?
- Why do you care?
- Thought you weren't heisting.
- I'm not.
I'm just interested in your comings and goings, because I care about you as a friend.
Okay, friend, I went to the bathroom.
Well, you were gone a long time, friend.
- You feeling okay, friend?
- No, it was number two, and it was very intense, friend.
-  - Bless you.
She sneezed.
Dog allergies.
Which means that Amy took Cheddar!
Where is my dog?
Aren't you standing right next to him?
This bitch?
Please.
Watch.
Shake.
Shake.
Idiot.
I know one of you took Cheddar, and you did it for the sake of the heist, but if anything happens to him, I will end you.
I couldn't bring myself to neuter Cheddar, but I will neuter you all.
Uh, bing-pot.
- Cheddar?
Cheddar?
-  Shake.
Ah, good grip, pristine coat.
That's my doggie!
You betrayed me.
You'll explain yourself later.
Return to my office.
Guys, why is there smoke coming from the break room?
What's going on?
Is someone doing something?
Who's doing something?
"Handmaid's Tale".
This is Amy.
She won't shut up about how relevant that show is - in today's political landscape.
- It's relevant as hell, but I'm not doing anything.
Terry also loved the show.
This is him.
No, no, I love Elisabeth Moss.
Terry thought the show was too bleak.
Oh, they're coming from everywhere.
Hello.
Blessed be the fruit, baby.
- Hitchcock, you watch that show?
- Watch what?
- That's my pickup line.
- What are they doing?
We haven't heard from Charles.
We need to check to make sure - everything's fine.
- Check what?
The server?
I stole the cummerbund from under there an hour ago.
- You knew about - About you playing?
The server?
I've known about your plans for weeks.
Uh-oh, they're circling.
Stop!
Hello, Ofamy.
Hello.
- I don't know what's going on.
- I do.
Handmaids, out!
They really listen to you.
You figured out I had the belt in my safe, and you thought you could distract me and steal the key.
I did think those things, yes, and then I did it.
Please.
Impossible.
The key has been in my shoe the entire time.
Okay, well, it's almost midnight.
Why don't you try and use your key?
It fits.
I knew you were lying.
You are so predictable.
Uh-oh, it's not turning.
I guess I'm not quite as predictable as you thought.
And I also bet none of you can predict what I'm gonna do next.
Use your key to open the safe and act like a dick about it?
Yes, obviously that's what I'm gonna do, Rosa.
You just have to be so spot-on all the time.
If I may mm just get my skirt up, thanks.
Oh, look at that, the key fits.
And the lock is turning, and the safe is empty?
- What?
- There's no cummerbund?
- Never was.
It was always a belt.
- I don't understand.
Who took it?
We haven't heard from Charles in an hour.
Maybe he betrayed The Tramps.
Oh, God, I just called us The Tramps.
What have I become?
It's not Charles.
I locked him up.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, I put a GPS tracker on the belt.
It's on the move, and it's going fast!
Let's take my bike.
They'll never catch us.
- Later, dorks.
- Should we follow them?
I  Captain, why are you giggling?
I put a GPS tracker inside of Terry.
Sarge, Kevin purchased one too many full-fat French yogurts.
- You want it?
- Absolutely.
Enjoy, Jeffords.
Enjoy.
Devious, I know, but I also put a tracker in Terry's yogurt.
Same here.
No reason.
Just 'cause you're a great sergeant.
-  - Now suck it down.
Eh, no problem, take it.
Swallow the 'gurt.
Do you guys think all that radiation - is bad for him?
- I'm sure he'll be fine.
- He's lived a long life already.
- Yeah.
Good luck keeping up with me.
I've done my morning calisthenics.
Oh, I'll keep up with you Rah!
In hell.
Mua-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
- Hello, Jacob.
- Dah!
What Ames What are you doing here?
Why aren't you out looking for the belt?
You and I both know the belt never left the precinct.
I don't know that.
Nobody knows that.
I kept thinking, "How did anyone swap my key"?
And then it hit me they didn't.
They swapped the safe.
One of the handmaids, I'm assuming fake Charles, took my safe, and then Ofamy deposited a lookalike.
What did you give fake Charles so he'd help you?
Nothing.
In fact, he gave me something, the power of financial freedom.
I invested in a pyramid scheme.
It's no time to go into it right now.
Okay so, while we all tried to figure out who had the real key, fake Charles broke into the safe, removed the tracke, and led Terry and the whole squad on a wild goose chase.
My only question is, which box is the belt in?
Well, good luck figuring it out, because the clock is tick-tick-tocking.
- It's that one.
- No!
The dust pattern on top doesn't match its neighbors.
You see, Jake, I'm always gonna be one step ahead of you.
You've lost the ability to surprise me.
Ya just plain boring.
Again, weird take on a very loving relationship.
And it's midnight, so I guess I'm an amazing human/genius.
Yeah.
Although you might wanna read the inscription on that there belt.
Why?
Oh, no, what does it say?
"Amy Santiago, will you marry me"?
Surprise.
I'm so confused I don't know what's happening right now.
"I'm so confused I don't know what's happening right now," - title of your sex tape.
- "Oh, my God, I'm shaking".
I'm definitely gonna cry," Title of your sex tape.
Wait, is this really happening?
Is this part of the heist?
If this is part of the heist, I will dump you so hard.
No, please, Ames, look, it's really happening, okay?
It's not part of the heist.
I promise, this is real.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Okay, here it goes.
Ames, I love you.
I love how smart you are.
I love how beautiful you are.
I love your face, and I love your butt.
I should've written this down first.
No, no, it's okay.
Go on.
I love how much you pretend to like "Die Hard".
- I like the second one.
- You don't have to.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
You're kind, and you're funny, and you're the best person I know, and the best detective.
Also, for reals, I love your butt.
- I love yours too.
- Gross.
Amy Santiago will you marry me?
Jake Peralta, I will marry you.
-  -  - I love you so much.
-  Hey, jerkos, this little Tramp escaped, so that ought to teach - D-did you just - Mm-hmm.
- And did you say - Mm-hmm.
- To Jake and Amy.
-  To Jake and Amy!
Great stuff, great stuff.
So, since Peralta altered the cummerbund, no one really won the heist this year.
Is that what everyone's thinking?
- Captain - Right, right, sorry.
Not the time.
I'm so happy for you both.
Technically, there was no winner.
Continue.
Hey, Gina just texted me.
She said, "Weird, I didn't even realize they were dating".
JK, so happy for you bitches".
- Oh.
- So, Jake, tell us everything.
- Did you call Amy's dad first?
- I actually did.
Mr. Santiago, I'm calling to inform you that I plan to ask your daughter to marry me, but since it's 2017, I am not asking you for your permission, as she is not your property, nor would she be mine, if she chooses to say yes.
She's a strong independent woman, and she don't need no man.
That being said, I truly hope she says yes.
But it's her decision, so just back off!
Aww, that was perfect.
What did he say?
I have no idea, I left a voicemail.
I'm terrified of him.
Not to talk out of turn, but I think I get credit for giving Jake the idea to propose.
- How's that?
- Remember?
That day in the kitchen.
So, what I'm saying is, vanilla yogurt is good, but pair it with a blueberry yogurt, and both of them taste even better.
- Get it?
- Yes?
I did not get it, but speaking of yogurt, you've eaten six GPS devices this week.
You should see a doctor.
- What?
- Hm?
Look, Sarge, I think everyone knows that I planted the idea in Jake's head eight years ago.
Oh, hi, I'm starting today.
Detective Santiago.
Oh, Detective Peralta.
Welcome aboard.
I'm hearing wedding bells.
Hi, Detective Boyle.
That actually really slowed things down.
It took, like, four years for me to forget that memory.
- Yeah, I'm my own worst enemy.
- Look, no one gave me the idea.
I decided to ask Amy to marry me all on my own on April 28th.
There's a typo in this crossword puzzle.
I don't get it.
Seems pretty normal.
I don't know what to tell you.
That's just when I knew.
Romantic epiphanies are dope.
Thank you, Rosa.
They are dope.
Yes, dope.
Congratulations.
I'm so happy you two are getting married.
- We're getting married.
- We're getting married!
- And no one won the heist.
-  Captain!
Get over it, ya jag!
Yeah, ya jag!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Hey, Charles, can we talk in the briefing room for a sec?
- There's a question I gotta ask you.
- Mm-hmm.
It's happening.
Jake is gonna pop the question.
- He's gonna ask me to be his BM.
- Both: No.
BM, best man, is a common abbreviation.
No one but you has ever used it.
I am so relieved.
I thought maybe he was gonna ask one of Amy's brothers or, ugh, Sarge.
- Hey, man, come on.
- Charles!
Okay, so I know this is a lot to ask No, it's not.
I want to do it.
You want to cover my shift this weekend so I can go to the White Plains Mall and meet Darryl Strawberry at the opening of a cellphone store?
Yes.
It's exactly what I was hoping you'd ask.
Great.
Thanks.
You sure it's okay?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
I'm very happy about it.
It'll be fun.
It'll be fun.
Uh, look at my smile.
Have to go now.
All: Surprise!
Oh, my God!
- Jake!
- What do you say, bud?
- Will you be my BM?
- Yes!
Yes, a million times, yes!
In your face, Terry!
What?
I'm holding a sparkler for you.
I helped organize a lot of this.
Well, you can stick that sparkler up your butt.
I'm the best man!
Captain, allow me to introduce you to major East Coast arms dealer Dan "Daniel" Valdano.
That's right, his nickname is longer than his actual name.
- Why's that, Terry?
- 'Cause he's a dick.
We got a warrant to bug him, but his house is a fortress and he never goes anywhere in public.
Luckily, CI just gave us a break.
Valdano's gonna actually leave his house to go to a high stakes poker game this Friday.
If we can get a seat at that table, we can lose this watch to him.
And guess what.
It's - Both: Bugged!
- Yes, it's bugged.
Good guess, Captain.
The plan is, we go to the club tonight, show off our poker skills, and get an invite to the high stakes game.
All we need is $15,000 to get in the door.
That's a lot of money.
How are your poker skills?
-  - A'ight.
- Good.
- A'ight.
- Hecka good.
- A'ight.
- So good.
- Perhaps I should see for myself.
- Oh.
Do you play?
- I am - A'ight.
- Damn, Cap.
- Are you secretly cool?
- Well, poker is just math, so I guess it depends on if you consider the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss cool.
I do not.
All right, let's play some cards.
Sarge asked me to help you guys with some filing.
Holy crap, this is gonna take all day.
Yup, it's what we call an all-dayer.
How long did it take you two to come up with that?
- That was a two-dayer.
- Okay, well, hand me some files.
You're not gonna bother actually walking?
Why should we?
We can work from down here.
I'm sitting down as long as I can.
I'm not getting out of the chair till it's time to go home.
- Ugh.
- Oh, typical standing elite.
You couldn't sit all day if you tried.
What?
You don't think I could outlast you turds in a chair?
Honey, you don't have the ass for it.
Let's talk terms.
Both cheeks on the cushion at all times.
Obviously.
Bathroom breaks?
Two and a half minutes every three hours.
But you gotta roll the chair fully into the stall.
- Obviously.
- Okay.
- Let's do this.
- Welcome to the Buttlympics.
I call to order the meeting of investors in the forthcoming Charles Boyle owned-and-operated food truck venture.
I know I'm the only investor, but is it cool if I take minutes?
Yes.
Put this down: we got a truck.
What?
Really?
That's huge.
Take a look.
Is that the NYPD police auction site?
Yeah, that's how I found out about it.
And there's our baby.
Isn't she a Murder truck?
That's the truck from the Tinga Time Taco murders!
Yes, two brothers were using a taco truck to move heroin and then were killed by the cartel - that supplied them.
- Not just killed, Boyle.
Dismembered.
Right in the truck.
Right in our truck.
That's why it was such bargain.
Everyone else was like, "Ooh, there's a knee in the fryer.
I don't want to sell food out of this".
- They found a knee in the fryer?
- Exactly.
You get it.
Well, now I get to go pick it up.
Oh, almost forgot my hazmat suit.
And I win again.
Which is not surprising, given how you are both terrible.
You don't even know the terminology.
- What are you talking about?
"Hit me".
- That is blackjack.
- Snake-eyes.
- Craps.
- Go Fish.
- And I believe that is - Go Fish.
- Fine.
Jake stinks, but I can play.
Yes, but you have a rather unfortunate tell: your right breast.
Oh, no.
My cards are terrible.
Sure they are.
Dammit, Eugene, you sold me out!
Captain, do I have a tell?
No, you don't understand the game well enough - to have a tell.
- Yeah, that makes sense.
What about you?
What's your tell?
It is subtle.
You will never discern it.
Oh, really?
Well, challenge accepted.
Tell me a lie.
You're both great at poker and I'm not gonna cancel the mission.
Nope, I couldn't see it.
Wait, what?
You're cancelling the mission?
You can't do that.
This is our only shot at catching Valdano.
It's a foolish plan.
Neither of you have any chance of making it to the VIP table.
But maybe you could.
What if you played?
No, I don't gamble anymore.
A few years back I had a minor addiction, specifically involving the ponies.
I'd like to bet $20,000 on Yabba Dabba Doo.
Sadly, Yabba Dabba Doo stumbled and had to be put down in front all of us.
- Oh.
That's fun.
- Wait.
What if I never went inside the casino?
I could be outside in a surveillance van, telling Peralta what to do.
Smart.
That way you never technically gamble.
- Right.
- I don't know.
Addiction is nothing to fool around with.
I had food issues.
I ate a crate of hams once.
Yeah, and look at you now.
You're like a super-jacked He-man guy, right?
It's settled; we'll go with the captain's plan.
Here's your persona: you're Billy "Big Time" Jankowski.
You wear sunglasses, headphones, and an unwashed hoodie.
You normally gamble online, from your mother's basement, where you live.
Seems unnecessary.
The hoodie hides your sunglass-camera's electronics.
I more meant the living in my mom's basement virgin vibe.
You added the virgin, but I like it.
It's part of your backstory now.
- But - You're a virgin.
That's an order.
But I don't want to be a virgin again.
Okay, I'm approaching the table.
Evening, gentlemen.
Let's play some cards.
And now, Peralta, say the following I'm coming in under the gun, and I've 15k behind.
Okay.
Action's on you.
Mmm, tasty.
Raise it 500.
Raise it 5-hundo.
- Made up my own.
- What?
I'm just talking to myself.
I'm used to playing online, so it's not weird.
Well, well, well.
You flopped the absolute nuts, Peralta.
Go all in.
Are you sure?
On the first hand, Captain?
It's what the math dictates.
At this moment there are no two cards that can beat Peralta.
- I'm all in.
- And now they all fold like so much recently dried linen.
- I'll call.
- What an idiot.
Two players.
- What?
- Full house wins.
- Yes!
- No, he won; not you.
You're out of chips.
Oh, well, that sucks.
Guess I'll just head back to my mom's basement.
I'm a virgin.
All clear.
No poopers.
Repeat: No poopers.
That was a disaster.
I thought Holt was supposed to be great at this.
- Any poopers?
- All clear.
- What happened, Captain?
-  That imbecile in the trucker hat hit both his runners and sucked out on the river.
Yeah, he did.
What does that mean?
Not to worry.
The odds of that happening again are infinitesimal.
Not that it matters.
Since we're out of money.
Oh, but we're not.
- Where'd this come from?
- It's my money.
There are 25 ATMs in this place.
Even the fire exit has one.
You want us to use your own money?
You sure that's a good idea?
I haven't placed a bet or touched a card.
I'm fine.
Technically that is true.
Trust me; the math is in our favor.
All right, let's get back in there and suck out two runners down by the river.
- Did I say that right?
- Not even close.
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Still, let's get in there and suck 'em out.
No time like the present.
And no place to do it like the men's bathroom, to leave from here to go do what we're talking about.
Ugh.
Nine hours and 55 minutes.
Is it?
I feel like I just sat down.
I have no feeling down there whatsoever.
I haven't in years.
I'm doing great too.
This has been a piece of ca Oh, butt cramp.
Butt cramp!
That sounds painful.
I bet you could use some electrolytes.
- Give me that!
That's mine.
- Come get it.
You'll never catch me!
Oh, won't I?
Oh!
Cramp over.
And so is our shift.
Ha.
And you thought I couldn't Wait, what are you doing?
You thought we were done just because our shift was over?
- Amateur.
- Oh.
So you wanna take this thing into overtime?
Fine.
I got no place to be.
Neither do I. I never do.
Then it's agreed.
The games continue.
And now you're going to - Fold.
- Fold.
- Fold.
- Fold.
- Fold.
- Fold.
Should we consider cutting our losses?
Hush, Sergeant.
Our cards are coming.
And there she is.
- You won.
- I won.
- You won!
- Won again.
- That's our straight.
- And again, again.
Hot damn!
Peralta, say "hot damn".
- Hot damn!
- Now you say it.
- Hot damn!
- Full house.
Eights over threes.
Good.
Now say to the dealer Well, this has been fun.
But I'm sick of playing with wittle wittle babies.
Is there a table for people who wear big boy pants?
Actually, there's a private game on Friday I think you might like.
Much obliged.
- Hey, there, bud.
- Hey.
Can we talk about the murder truck we just purchased with our very hard-earned money?
Oh, Amy, wait till you see her.
I spent all night pressure-washing her, and she is spotless.
Yeah, it's just, what if word gets out that our food truck was the site of a double homicide?
What if word gets out?
It's in the "Our Story" section of the menu.
We're calling it Murder Truck!
- We are?
- Yeah!
- It was your idea.
- No, it was my greatest fear.
I can't believe you're leaning into the murder thing.
Well, it'll get people talking.
Check out the menu.
It's printed on a crime scene photo.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Charles, we're gonna lose all of our money.
Are you worried?
Oh, okay, I see what's happening.
Starting a business is very scary.
But I promise you, once you see our truck, you'll feel a lot better.
Come on.
No, no, no, no, no!
My truck!
My beautiful truck!
Someone killed ripped her apart!
Charles, please tell me you got insurance.
- I did.
- Okay, thank God.
Coverage starts tomorrow.
Well, Valdano's gonna be there tonight, and the recording device in the watch is transmitting.
I feel like Bond.
Terry Bond.
Well, technically I'm the one wearing the watch, so that would make you Q at best.
- Terry Q. - Yeah.
Way to roll with it.
Come on, let's tell Holt we're prepped for tonight.
I gotta say, I was wrong about him.
He had no problem walking away last night.
He left a lot of hams in that crate.
Juicy.
Spiral-cut, honey-sweet but salty - Sarge, come back to me.
- What?
You're the one that brought up ham.
- That was you.
- Holt: Yes, yes, come to papa.
Raise it a grand!
Call.
Raise.
A pair of candy canes.
I'm all in, baby.
- What are you doing, sir?
- Working the case.
Sharpening my poker skills for Valdano.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and why are you watching this children's beauty pageant?
For fun, obviously.
No, Jayla, don't drop the baton.
No, I had so much riding on you!
Oh no.
He is deep in the ham crate.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.
Captain Holt's been in his office gambling for hours.
Our only choice is to cut off his internet.
No, I mean, are you sure you know how to do that?
Of course.
I just have to pull this  Oh!
- Gah.
- Wrong wire.
Yep, we'll we'll fix that later.
And - Holt: What the hell?
- Got it.
Having trouble with your internet, sir?
He's not here.
Where'd he go?
Roof.
What are you doing?
Trying to pick up a Wi-Fi signal from across the street.
I've got $8,000 riding on little Jayla.
Don't you think you have a bit of a problem here, sir?
I'm in complete control.
Now, Terry, come over here and dangle me off the edge of this building.
Sir, I am not going to dangle you off the side of this building.
You're fired.
Peralta, let me climb onto your shoulders.
- I can't - You're fired.
No one works here anymore.
Look, we need to have a real talk about your gambling.
Relapsing is nothing to be ashamed of.
A couple years ago on my birthday I treated myself to one piece of pizza.
I woke up the next morning in a Sbarro on the Jersey Turnpike.
It wasn't even open!
That's not what's happening here.
I'm not weak like you.
I can stop whenever I want.
- Then stop.
- I don't want.
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm heading to the acai bowl internet cafÃ©.
Got a lot of money riding on the NLCS, whatever the hell that is.
We can't let you do that.
And how exactly will you stop me?
We'll call your husband.
No.
No, I can't put Kevin through this, not again.
You're right.
I've lost control, and I'm taking myself off this case.
And I'm not going anywhere near gambling again.
- You promise?
- From the bottom of my heart.
It's a dead issue.
I'm proud of you, sir.
So am I, Captain.
So I'm sorry.
Terry, you went to Jersey for pizza?
- I had a problem, man!
- Right, sorry.
Ugh, how long have we been sitting?
My butt's lost track of time.
- Coming up on 32 hours.
-  I miss the little things.
Showers.
Feeling my feet.
- Standing.
- I miss my home chair.
You miss a chair?
I just want walk up to the hot dog stand out front and get a fresh wiener.
Oh, man.
Why did you say that?
Now I want one.
- So you should go get one.
- Oh, and let you win?
You're just trying to get us to stand up.
No.
We should all go get one - in our chairs.
- She's right.
The only thing holding us back is society.
Mmm.
So good.
I got it.
No.
- My ass.
- It left the chair.
I'm sorry, man.
No.
It was my time.
It's our time too.
We've been through hell together.
Now we stand together.
Nope.
Legs are dead.
Going down.
-  -  Charles, what are you doing?
I know having our truck smashed to bits was a bit of a setback, but don't worry; I have an idea.
The truck was deconstructed so we do Not have a business anymore?
No.
We do deconstructed food.
For instance, a deconstructed meatball sub: a meatball, rolled in breadcrumbs with a caramelized tomato sauce drizzle.
- Taste it.
- Charles, I appreciate that you're trying to fix this situation, but you don't have to.
I have great news.
I know who robbed us.
The cartel who did the taco truck murders ripped apart the truck, because there was heroin still inside it.
We found opioid traces behind the fridge.
I had forensics scour the truck for DNA and we got a match: a cartel enforcer.
Do you know what this means?
The truck becomes a crime scene again.
Yes!
It's been impounded.
We get our money back!
Great.
I'm glad you get your money back.
You can invest it in something you actually believe in instead of My balls.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have 50 pounds of meat I have to return before it goes rotten.
Like my dreams.
There's Valdano.
The watch is transmitting.
All you have to do is lose it to him.
- Worst of luck to you.
- Don't worry, Terry.
I'm about to crap the bed.
Evening, gentlemen.
Ready for some poker?
- That's why we're here.
-  Good one, stranger.
I'll take 150.
Holt: Hot damn!
Four queens.
I call this hand the Golden Girls.
Damn it.
Oh, you would look at that.
My mom's calling me.
She's flipping her lid because she found all my nudie mags in the basement.
Anyways, BRB.
What happened to not wanting to gamble anymore for Kevin?
Sir, you are spiraling.
You lied straight to our faces.
Well, that's on you.
If you could spot my tell, you would've known.
Fine.
What's your tell?
Let's just say, I'm doing it right now.
I'm doing it at this very moment.
- Is it standing up?
- I've just done it again.
Whoops, there's another time.
I don't understand.
Even if you wanted to gamble, why come here, where we'd be?
I lost some money on lame little Jayla, and I realized that's because I've been gambling instead of being down here doing what I'm good at math.
Now go get Valdano before you blow your covers.
I'm off duty; what I do on my own time is my own business.
Unlike you two who are still on the clock and are now being bad cops.
Wow, listen to you talking all smooth.
But you can't fool us, sir.
You might as well face it.
You're addicted to math.
Robert Palmer.
Come on, Sarge.
Let's go.
So you're a cop.
There was a pooper.
Sorry about that.
Crisis averted: I told her I read the magazines for the articles.
She totally bought it.
- Wait a sec, where are you going?
- Got called away on business.
Come back next Friday; I'll take your money from you then.
Well, we'll just see about that, Mr. Cool Voice.
His voice is really cool.
So I understand you're a cop who's trying to bring me down.
Why don't we take a little drive?
Why did you stay at the table so long after Valdano was already gone?
It would've been suspicious if I left right after he did, so I played a couple hands.
Come on, let's grab Holt and get out of here.
Wait.
Where's Holt?
So what was your plan, cop?
Does it matter?
We failed and now you know we're onto you.
You get to come out ahead tonight, provided you don't do anything dumb right now.
My colleagues are calling, probably wondering where I am.
Then put their minds at ease.
- Yes?
- Captain.
We're leaving.
Where are you?
I've already left.
I don't enjoy being judged, so I'm on my way to Atlantic City for the weekend.
I'll be gambling.
No, sir, please just come back, okay?
Terry and I will keep you company.
We'll go to a museum.
One of the boring ones with no dinosaurs.
Forget it.
I shouldn't've answered.
Bye-bye "Toxic".
Bye-bye "Party in the USA".
Hey, Charles.
What are you doing?
I'm deleting all the upbeat music off my computer.
I know you're down, but Bye-bye "Swish Swish Bish".
Look, I feel really bad about the way I treated you.
Well, you shouldn't.
You're the only one who saw that my dream was stupid and then you got me all my money back.
Well, after you left, I tried one of your meatballs and then another.
And another.
I couldn't stop because they were so damn good.
Really?
You liked them?
I loved them.
I should have tried them earlier.
I lost track of the fact that this whole thing was supposed to be about your food.
I think we should buy another food truck.
- You do?
- Yes.
But I have some conditions: 1, it cannot be a crime scene; 2, you have to get insurance on day one; 3, you have to keep dreaming up amazing things to cook.
You're so good, Boyle.
Deal!
We're gonna buy a food truck!
We're gonna get a food truck!
Yes!
Stop!
I ate too many meatballs.
Oh.
- Where we going?
- Atlantic City.
That's where you told your friends you'd be, so that's where they'll find your body.
I'm a captain in the NYPD.
Yeah, and you're also a known gambling addict.
You lost all your money in A.C. and then drowned yourself in the ocean.
-  -  -  - Stay down!
Terry: NYPD!
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Hey there, Captain Holt.
We just saved your big ol' butt.
Hello, Dan "Daniel" Valdano.
- Guess what.
- Terry: You're a dick!
Yeah.
How did you find me?
We traced your phone and tracked down the limo.
Wait.
How did you even know I was in trouble?
I figured out your tell.
When you're lying, you use contractions.
Lots of 'em.
I've lost control.
I'm taking myself off the case.
I've just done it again.
Whoops.
There's another time.
I shouldn't've have answered.
Shouldn't've answered.
Shouldn't've It was the "shouldn't've" that finally tipped me off.
I've never heard you use a double contraction before.
And you never will again.
I was at rock bottom.
I feel so embarrassed.
I understand.
I've been there.
I once ate a box of uncooked rice in a movie theater.
Wow, really?
- Jake.
- I'm sorry.
I owe you two a tremendous debt of gratitude.
I was overwhelmed by my addiction and you were there for me.
Of course, sir.
We'd do anything for you.
Perhaps you two would take me to a meeting of Gambler's Anonymous.
- Absolutely.
- And, Jake, before we go, - I need to admit one more thing.
- Of course, anything.
When I made you tell that table that you were living in your mother's basement, it wasn't for the case.
I was just messing with you.
Oh, well played, sir.
But the joke's on you.
My mother has a fantastic basement.
Title of your sex tape.
Too soon?
All right, let's go.
Hey, standing desk.
Look who's taking care of herself.
- Someone's not sitting down on the job.
- Hey.
Sitting down on the job is damned hard work, and those heroes prove it every day.
Mad respect.
Okay.
Sorry.
Seriously, you guys should stand up once in a while.
You know, for your hearts.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 Okay hole me.
- Mm!
- Nothin' but mouth.
- Whoa, impressive.
- Are you kidding me?
That's uh-nothing.
Diaz has been chucking D-holes into my mouth-piece since we were back at the academy.
Check this out.
Oh!
- Express yourself - I'm expressing With my full capabilities and now I'm living In correctional facilities 'Cause some don't agree with how I do this  Droppin' flavor my behavior is hereditary But my technique is very necessary Blame it on Ice Cube - Because he said it gets - Oh!
- All: Oh!
- Uh-oh.
Heads!
What the?
It's finally happening!
Attention, Nine-Nine.
We have an announcement.
"Shrek Live" is coming back to Broadway!
- Nope, you dreamed that.
- Aw.
We just came in here to tell you to save the date, because we're getting married on May 15th.
We found a venue!
Wow!
Finding a place in the spring in New York is impossible.
Sharon and I had to get married in Albany in December.
Terry was too cold to consummate.
- Hm, good to know.
- We got really lucky.
The place was booked solid for the next two years, but a couple fell out.
Of a fifth-floor window.
She was teetering and he tried to grab her Babe, we agreed we wouldn't talk about that part.
Right sorry.
It was gruesome.
Never again.
The EMTs said that it was a meat pancake.
I'm done.
So, tell us about the venue.
Oh, well, there's not much to tell other than it's a gorgeous mansion!
- Big ol' house!
- With a professional kitchen.
- Chop-chop, y'all!
- Ooh.
A private library for the ceremony.
My girl loves books!
Seven bathrooms!
No lines, ladies!
And an outdoor reception area.
Uh-can I get a gazebo?
I apologize to a host of communities.
The point is, these nuptials are going to be "toit"!
Speaking of "toit nups," we better get going, because we don't have a lot of time and we have to meet with 17 wedding vendors.
A jam-packed schedule that could only be achieved by a type-A personality!
- Jake.
- Yep, we gotta go.
I have some unfortunate news.
An NYPD officer has gone missing.
The department suspects foul play.
Oh, my God.
Do we know the officer?
Yes, it's Sergeant Peanut Butter.
- My nemesis.
- Your nemesis is a horse?
Are you still mad at Peanut Butter because he won a medal the same day as you?
He totally upstaged me.
He Tucci-ed me!
Look what you get if you do an image search of "Charles Boyle, medal of valor".
Huh?
They cropped me out of my own photo!
You just keep that tab open on your phone all the time?
No, I just looked it up real fast.
You didn't see.
Captain, I solved it.
Charles kidnapped Peanut Butter.
I did not.
But it's no surprise that somebody did.
Hey, my kids love that horse.
Your kids need help wiping their butts, Sarge.
They're not exactly geniuses.
The actual suspect is Jesse Gurmwald, a disgruntled civilian admin who was recently fired by the mounted unit.
He's gone to ground, but detectives throughout the city are checking every possible hideout.
Diaz, Boyle: here's a list of locations in our precinct.
- Be thorough.
- Yes, sir.
And just to be clear, if I went missing, you guys would conduct an equally thorough search, right?
You should get going.
So, we can wrap it in silk, or, for a more rustic feel burlap.
Oh that's neat, but We want these nups to be toit.
- Excuse me?
- Could we wrap the flowers in "New York Times" crossword puzzles from key dates in our lives?
Oh is that something you'd like?
Uh, boi-oi-oi-oi-oing!
Here's the deposit.
I designed you a signature cocktail.
I call it the "Peraltiago".
Both: Ooh!
Mm and the judges give it a score of Jeremy, did you make that cake that I called you about?
Yes, I wasn't entirely sure if you were joking or not, but A Nakatomi Plaza cake?
The groom is on a licorice hose.
Welcome to the wedding, pal.
Oh, Amy.
These nups may be getting too toit.
Since Diaz and Boyle are searching for Peanut Butter, I need you to be available to work any cases that might come in.
Of course, Captain.
My pleasure.
Morning, Amanda.
Oh, and I thought we should transfer the Glenmoore assault to the Nine-Eight.
Absolutely.
Brian.
Looking swole.
You're looking swole.
Is today leg day?
Legs for an hour, two hours blasting the glutes.
Terry's got butt for days!
Excuse me?
I said, "Terry's got butt for days"!
Please stop talking about my body.
- What?
- I'm Teri.
You just said I had "butt for days".
Oh, I see what just happened.
Terry's gonna regret this.
- Are you threatening me?
- No!
No, no.
This is a misunderstanding.
My name is also Terry, and I was talking about my butt.
So you were complimenting your own body?
Well, I'm pretty proud of it.
Do you know how old I am?
Okay.
Apology accepted.
Seems pretty arrogant, though.
This might not be the right time, but talking about yourself in the third person - has finally - Terry knows!
- I love our venue so much.
- Me too.
It's like our very own Hogwarts.
- Yes!
And I'm Hermione.
- Yes!
And I am Snape.
- What?
- I never realized I could have feelings this strong about a building.
Okay, we just have to drop off our deposit, and then we're done for the day.
Well, it would appear that we have achieved what scholars refer to as the "toitest of nups"!
Indeed!
Both:  Ooh!
Oh, hi Susan.
- Hey.
- We're normal people.
Hi, I was just about to call you guys.
Ah, well, no need to call, because we are here.
- And we've got our deposit.
- Thank you so much.
We just booked all our vendors.
It's really happening.
Yeah, about that Wait, what's wrong?
Something's wrong.
That's the look my mom gave me right before she told me that my dad left.
Oh, God, did my dad leave my mom again?
- How do you know my mom and dad?
- You know, I'm so sorry.
There must have been a mix-up.
Someone just contacted my manager and booked the venue before you got here.
But we had an oral agreement.
You said we had until the end of the day EOD.
It's not EOD.
The D hasn't E'd.
It won't be E'd for ages!
I'm sorry.
It's out of my hands, you know?
Someone just swooped in and got it.
Wait.
Susan Susan!
Who?
Who would do that?
Amy, we had something great in the palm of our hands, and then someone swooped in at the last minute and stole it?
There's only one person who would do that.
No.
But it couldn't be!
Ah, but it is.
Both: The Vulture!
Suckers.
Oh, no.
Our nups have been un-toitened.
We've got loose nups.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's your game here, Vulture, huh?
Why are you renting our venue?
Why do you think, meat farts?
- I'm getting married.
- Really?
You once told me that marriage is for women and gays.
And that the only thing you're married to is banging married chicks.
Yeah, and I meant it all.
But love?
Love hath changed me.
No it hathn't.
You just vultured our venue.
Yeah, but I did it for love.
My fiancÃ©e, she means everything to me.
You know, she's hot like a chick, she's smart like a guy.
Just talking to her gives me a Harrelson.
- Harrelson?
- Woody.
- Ew.
- Yeah.
Look, I know I've become that gross, sappy guy, but dude, she's the first chick I ever wanted to hang out with post-bang.
I can't believe a real person has agreed to marry you.
Oh, my lady's real, all right.
Her name is Jean Munhroe, and we complete the living hell out of each other sometimes twice a night.
- both groan.
] -  Hey, you know what?
I need to handle this right now.
Look, I know how hard it is to find a venue.
But if it could happen for me, it could happen for you.
It happened for you because it did happen for us.
Chins up, dingdongs.
I'm trying to be happy over here.
- Ugh.
-  Jake, what are we gonna do?
We already gave deposits to all our vendors.
We're gonna get this place back.
How?
The Vulture's not gonna budge.
Yeah, maybe, but he does have a weak spot: his woman.
Not that women are weak.
Just, she's our best shot, - and she happens to be a woman.
- Totally.
Let's go talk to that spineless skank.
Yeah.
Why do we even have police horses anymore?
We have motorcycles now.
They're faster, cooler.
They also don't get boners in the background of every photo of you and the mayor.
What do you mean?
A horse is a perfect partner.
Tough, scary, and they don't show you 30 pictures of their kid dressed as Wario for Halloween.
I'm not talking about Nikolaj.
I literally just showed you those pictures five minutes ago.
Really?
I don't remember that.
- Hmm.
-   NYPD!
Hands where we can see 'em!
Step away from Peanut Butter.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
You guys thought you could catch me?
I'll head him off.
Fine, I'll get the dumb horse.
All right.
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
Come on, you idiot!
Run!
Ugh, you dumb horse.
Ha!
Peanut Butter!
Stop!
Peanut Butter, stop!
- Stop!
- Boyle!
Just let go!
Okay, we have to force the She-Vulture, Jean Munhroe, to give us our venue back, so put on your game face, 'cause we're about to stare down the devil.
Devil can't stare if the devil's got tears in her eyes and blood in her ears.
Oh, I love your intensity.
All right, this is where she works.
"The Zenith Fund".
Ulch, it even sounds evil.
Of course it is.
She's marrying the Vulture.
Everything about her is evil.
Time to enter the den of bastards who deserve to die.
All right, snake, show your face it's a charity.
Amy, it's a charity.
Look at this: "Jean, your selflessness "puts us all to shame.
Humbled, Michelle Obama".
Both: Damn, Jean.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Uh, yes.
We're looking for Jean Munhroe.
- We know her fiancÃ©.
- Oh, I'm Jean.
Are you Jake and Amy?
Keith has told me all about you.
- He says you guys are the best.
- Really?
- Keith says that?
-  Yeah oh, Janice?
That village needs rice.
Double the last shipment.
Just take the overage out of my paycheck.
So, what brings you guys to the Zenith Fund?
Uh actually, something super important -  - Oh, I am so sorry.
- I've gotta take this.
- Mm-hmm.
What do you mean, "roadblock"?
Do I have to fly down there and talk to the rebels myself?
Just get the rice to those kids.
Asante sana, Rafiki.
Sorry about that.
Wow, your job sounds very intense.
No, no, no, it's nothing compared to what these children go through on a daily basis.
It really puts things in perspective.
- Right.
- So, what was the important thing you came down here to talk about?
Uh the kids.
- And the rice.
- And putting the rice in the kids.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have two new donors!
Yay!
Ooh, there's a bell.
- Oh!
-   Do y'all have an ATM?
Sir, can I get $350 in petty cash?
I need to throw an ice cream party for Teri-with-an-I, make sure - there's no hard feelings.
- Why?
She gets it was a misunderstanding.
She's a Teri, and you're a Terrance who, even though he's not a child, still goes by a nickname ending in a Y. I mean, don't people call you Ray?
How dare you.
Sir, I don't want any tension between the squad and the uniformed officers.
I'm just thinking about the precinct.
You're lying.
You're upset because Teri-with-an-I called you arrogant, and you have a pathological need to be liked.
What?
No, I don't.
I just happen to be a great person who's naturally beloved by all despite my personal ambivalence.
Well, if that's true, then you won't mind walking across the bullpen without saying hello to anybody.
No problem.
No nods allowed.
What?
Okay, it's gonna be okay.
You're a busy sergeant.
They can't always expect you to be friendly.
Time to go to frown town.
Let's do this, Jeffords.
- Hey, Sarge.
- Bill!
What up, man?
You were right.
Terry loves to be loved!
Hey, Monica!
Hey, Dough.
Ooh, who wants a nod?
Hey.
Any luck finding a new venue - that's available on May 15th?
- Yeah.
- May 15, 2026.
-  Please tell me the vendors are giving us back - our deposits.
- Yes.
One of them.
The photographer.
Provided that you hang out with him, so how do you feel about spending the weekend on his houseboat in Yonkers?
Ugh, Jake.
Forget the perfect wedding.
- We're screwed.
- I know.
I can't believe that saint of a woman is actually marrying the Vulture.
Maybe he's changed.
- How is that even possible?
- I don't know.
Nothing makes sense anymore.
The Vulture's not the Vulture, good is bad, up is down, there's a young pope, winter has come.
That reminds me: I ordered some premium cable channels.
Hitchcock?
What was that sound?
I just got an alert from my hookup app.
I'm about to boink with a local single in my area.
- Ames.
- Jake.
- Ames.
- Jake!
- Ames!
- Jake!
Up is up, down is down, the Vulture still boinks!
I need to handle this right now.
I can't believe that bastard is cheating on nice Jean.
We have to save her.
We have to break them up.
- For nice Jean!
- And the starving kids.
- And Michelle Obama.
- And a little side benefit: if we break them up, we get our venue back.
Yes, but the main reason is to save a wonderful person from making a horrible mistake.
Of course.
That's obviously the point.
The venue is just secondary.
What venue?
We're great people.
Hey, Jake.
See?
Okay, so the Vulture is cheating on Jean Munhroe, which totally tracks, because he is the epitome of awful.
- Ooh, nice use of "epitome".
- Thanks, babe.
My question is, why pretend to change?
I mean, why get married at all?
I'll tell you why.
Because Jean's dad is worth $100 million, and she's his only heir.
Then why did she need our $1,000?
I mean, I'm so happy we gave the money so the kids could have rice and et cetera.
- So, how do we break them up?
- Simple.
We catfish him with Hitchcock's hookup app.
Then, when he takes the bait, we make him end things with Jean respectfully and gently.
Perfect.
She hurts for a bit, but she eventually moves on, and she finds a much better man.
Yes.
And as a distant, secondary benefit, we get the mansion back.
Agreed.
Okay.
So, let's create a temptress - that will boink-match with him.
- Yeah.
- What's the sexiest name?
- Valerie.
That was fast.
Do you know a Valerie?
No.
I wish.
All right, she's 19, from Daytona, and her job is "spray tannist".
Ugh, "tannist".
Not a real word.
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.
Okay, she's into spring break, bong rips, slurping shots, and crop tops that say "little cutie".
- Noice.
- She is not into nerds, wearing pants, needy guys, monogamy, or feminism, and her quote is, "Whatever happened to 'Girls Gone Wild'"?
This Valerie sounds like a real pill.
Okay.
Let's see who our matches are.
Here we go.
-  - Uh-huh.
Gross, mm-hmm.
Oh, Hitchcock.
I mean, "Dave, age 28"?
- Ugh.
- Come on.
- Oh!
- Gotcha.
There he is.
All right.
And so begins the delicate dance.
We begin with a simple hello.
And then we wait, so as not to seem too aggressive No, he sent us a picture of his penis!
-  -  Oh, God, he just sent 15 more.
Oh, God, it's horrible.
But it's wonderful.
We're gonna save Jean!
Yes, and we're gonna get the mansion back!
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, he put a little hat on it.
Ugh.
Hey, there you are.
- You okay?
- Yeah, no burns.
The doctor said I was lucky my body was so damp.
- So why did it take so long?
- Well, the EMT spent loads of time on Peanut Butter.
But you know what?
I don't care, because I saved that dumb horse, so I'm the hero.
And this time, when I get my medal, my whole face will be in the picture.
- You haven't seen "The Post," have you?
- What?
No.
- Why?
- Somebody was walking by the fire and took a picture on their cell phone.
What?
That's not what happened.
I saved him.
That's not how they're reporting it.
No, look.
"Daily News" got it right.
Yeah.
"Hero Cop Saves Helpless Buffoon".
Oh, no.
Am I the buffoon?
Uh-oh, dropped your phone.
Now we'll never know.
Wait.
There was a dash cam in the car.
We have footage of what really happened!
Brass already called.
They don't want us releasing that footage.
A hero horse is good PR for the department.
Hey, man, uh Peanut Butter's going on "Ellen".
"Ellen"?
That's my dream!
Now he gets to dance with DJ tWitch!
What's going on here?
I'm throwing Teri-with-an-I's party with my own money.
I didn't know her favorite kind of ice cream, so I printed a photo of her and showed it to all the ice cream places within 30 blocks.
Nobody recognized her, so I got every flavor 200 pints.
This is the greatest day of my life.
Have you considered this Teri-with-an-I might not - be an ice cream person?
- I did think that.
That's why there's a taco bar coming.
- Yes.
- Plus barbecue.
- Yes.
- Plus a popcorn guy.
-  Yes.
- Plus vegan options.
- Why?
- Sergeant, you've become unhinged.
There's always gonna be people in this world who don't like you.
That's a fact of life.
I hear you, sir.
But I hate the feeling of people being mad at me.
So what?
I was voted least friendly in high school, and here I am, a police captain.
Do you know what Mr. Popularity Vincent Mondale is doing these days?
He's a sociologist, for God's sake.
Sociologist, Terry.
I'm sorry, but I gotta do this.
Okay, but just know if you go through with this party, I will like you less.
Hello, Vulture.
Got a minute?
Doesn't matter.
We don't care.
Let me guess.
You guys are here to cry about the wedding venue that I stole from you - fair and square, right?
- No.
Actually, we wanna talk to you about some other things.
Like spring break, slurping shots, and hating pants.
Wait a second, why does that sound familiar?
I don't know.
Maybe you should ask Valerie.
Yeah, that's right.
We catfished you.
- Boom.
- You're Valerie?
Ah, I can't believe I actually wasted my sweet dong snaps on you bozos.
All right, here's how this is gonna go.
You are gonna break up with Jean, because we all know you're just marrying her for her money.
You're gonna do it nicely and respectfully, and you're gonna make a generous donation - to her charity.
- Nice touch, Ames.
You guys got it all wrong.
I don't care that she's rich.
Look, I love her.
I just got spooked.
You put a vulture into a cage, and  It freaks out.
Actually, vultures do very well in captivity - and they mate for life.
- Research burn.
All right, look.
I'm deleting the app from my phone as we speak, okay?
Come on.
Jean's over 30.
No amount of money in the entire world could make me marry a woman that old.
But love can.
And will.
You have two options.
Either you break up with her Or we send her the penis pics even the one next to the I'm guessing, a mini soda can?
- Nah, it was regular size.
- Really?
Oh, Jean's here.
So what's it gonna be?
You gonna tell her, or do we have to?
- I've changed.
- Nope.
- I won't do it again.
- Nope.
I'll give you the venue.
- Oh.
- What's that?
I'll give you the venue if you don't say anything, but if you do, I'm gonna keep it.
Even if she and I break up, all right?
I love her.
I promise you this.
- Both: Deal.
- Okay.
Now just act normal, please.
Oh, wow.
What a surprise.
- My donors.
- Hello, Jean Munhroe!
Nice to see you, Jean Munhroe!
You all looked so intense when I got here.
What were you talking about?
- Crime scene.
- Soup.
Uh soup crime scene.
The Chowder Killer's back at it again.
Oh, I haven't heard of him.
Yeah, well, he just moved to Manhattan from New England.
You guys are so lucky to all work together.
Oh, my gosh, what is Keith like at work?
Aw, Keith?
Our Keith?
-  - Well, he's a real crack-up, I'll tell you that for free.
We have so many inside jokes.
- So many inside jokes.
- Mm-hmm.
Hey, guys potato salad?
You wouldn't understand.
It's from work.
Oh, my gosh, you guys are so crazy.
-  - Yeah.
So how did you two meet?
Oh, someone stole from my charity, and another detective was working on the case so hard for months, and Keith came in, and solved it right away.
Swooped in like an eagle.
That's why my nickname's the Eagle.
- Right, guys?
- Yep.
Everyone calls him  The Eagle.
So, when did you decide to propose?
Oh ah, well, we were just hanging out one night, and I looked over at Amy and it hit me.
She's incredible and my best friend, and I just knew in that moment I wanted to spend my life with her.
I know what you mean.
Keith and I are the same way.
It is so nice to finally find someone I can trust.
Oh, boy.
- I can't do this.
- Yeah, it's bad.
Jean, we have to show you something.
- No!
- A penis?
Why?
Yep, should've explained it first.
Reese Witherspoon is optioning the Peanut Butter story?
- What?
- Forget that dumb horse.
Have you seen this?
"Exclusive Dash Cam Footage Reveals Hero Cop Saved Sergeant Peanut Butter".
I don't understand.
How'd they get this?
Somebody must have leaked it.
Perfect partner isn't a horse.
The perfect partner is somebody who, no matter how much they hate you, would run through a fire to save your life.
Aw.
Thank you, Rosa.
You're welcome.
All right, come with me.
We're going to Shaw's.
- Whoa, all this is for me?
- Yep.
You saved Peanut Butter, even though he's a dick.
- He is a dick.
- To Charles Boyle, everybody!
All: To Charles Boyle!
Thanks, guys.
So, Terry, you decided not to throw a party - for Teri-with-an-I?
- You were right.
Why bother trying to win over a stranger when I can make someone I care about happy instead?
Well, for the record, Jeffords I like you a lot and I always have.
All right.
Whatever.
I taught him well.
Who am I kidding?
Terry needs a hug!
Mm?
Hey, I'm still a little shaken up.
- We did the right thing, right?
- Yes, definitely.
She's way better off without him.
And she let him know it.
Yeah, for a human angel, girl could throw down.
I hate wasting rice but I hate you more!
She may be the coolest woman I've ever met.
- Yeah.
- So, what's up with the wedding?
Do we need to find a new venue?
Actually, we found a place that's available on the same date.
- Ooh, is it another mansion?
- No, it is not.
Listen up, everybody!
We are getting married - in a public rec center!
- Super cheap!
- On a basketball court!
- Squeak-squeak!
- With one working bathroom!
- Ladies gotta wait!
And it's in deep Staten Island.
Destination wedding, y'all!
But the point is, these nuptials are still gonna be mad toit.
I would marry you in a dumpster.
Aww, I would marry you in a dumpster.
Dudes, the Vulture's throwing an all-girl pudding wrestling party in a mansion in May!
It's the only important thing happening that day!
- After party?
- Fits our budget.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Gobble!
Gobble!
Tommy Gobbler's back and he wants to hear what you turkeys are thankful for.
- Charles, you gotta stop.
- Nah.
I don't gobble understand people.
- But, Charles - Gobble.
- Dude.
- Gobble.
Gobble, gobble, your tail feather is caught in the gobble door.
Thank you.
Gobble wait, what?
- Ow.
-  I think your feathers are ripping.
-  - Gobble.
Gobble.
All right, you know the drill.
We've been living and breathing this operation for years.
It goes down today and we only get one shot.
Thanksgiving 2017, the meeting of the parents.
Our objective is clear.
Our parents will laugh, they will bond, and then when the time is right, our fathers will share a hug good-bye and it will be weird, but in the good way.
Oh, my God.
What is that photo?
I did an image search for dad's hugging.
I didn't have a lot of time to put this board together.
Now then, let's review our targets, shall we?
First we have the Santiagos: Camila and Victor.
They are traditional, reserved, and like their daughter, controlling.
I wouldn't say I'm controlling.
I would say I'm Type A. You should write Type A there instead of controlling.
Vivid example of what we're up against.
Now then, on the other side, we have the Peraltas: Karen and Roger.
They are perfectly normal, no known flaws.
All right, fine.
My dad's a selfish drunken slut - and my mom's a flighty weirdo.
- This is gonna be a disaster.
I knew you'd say that, which is why we have this.
A list of things they have in common.
We can use it to grease the conversation.
Ooh, convo grease.
This is perfect.
Okay, our dads both golf.
Our mom's both paint.
All four of them have hair.
Yeah, but that's bottom of the barrel stuff.
We're not gonna have to use that.
Oh, you did a lot of work on this.
- I'm really impressed.
- Oh, well, you know, it's really important to me.
I feel like it's a chance for me to finally have the big family Thanksgiving - I never got as a kid.
- Oh, babe.
It's gonna be amazing.
Are you erasing the word controlling behind my back - while we kiss?
- Mm-hmm.
We can keep it in my office until it's time to leave.
What do you have in the pastry box, sir?
Brownies?
No, you hold brownies from the side.
He's holding it from the bottom.
True.
Maybe it s a cheesecake.
But there's no condensation on the box.
- It's room temperature.
- Look at the finger spread, tensing in the shoulders.
He's supporting something dense.
-  It's a pie.
- It is a pie.
- Damn, that was impressive.
- But this is not just any pie.
It's an English walnut pie from the Cottage Inn - in Saratoga Springs.
- Raymond and I drive all the way upstate for it every year.
It's the finest sweet treat on earth.
Even better than a plain scone.
Wow, that good, huh?
We're bringing it to Kevin's parents' house tonight.
Can't wait.
What do you all have planned for Turkey day?
Well, I've got a great Thanksgiving planned.
Nikolaj has taken to food just like his papa, so I'm making an exotic spread.
If it can fly or swim, we're eating its eggs.
Well, at the Jefford's house, it's not just Thanksgiving, it's also Ava's birthday, so we do it up huge.
I got her a Perry the Parrot.
That's a hot toy.
Terry tried ten toy stores.
I guess I'm only one doing this holiday right.
Hitting the open road with my bike.
No family, no friends, no dinner.
- That sounds really dark.
- Thank you.
Well, everyone's plans seem lovely.
Oh, Hitchcock and I didn't say ours.
How unfortunate.
Okay, the house is all clean.
The wine is in the fridge.
What is this pitcher of gray water?
I read an article that said when you wash vegetables, all the nutrients leech into the water and then you can drink it.
They call it a super water.
Oh.
Well, that's neat.
I am gonna just hide it right over here.
Dad, you almost ready?
The Santiago's are very punctual?
I'm already out of the shower.
- Chill, bro.
- Don't call me bro.
- I'm your son.
- Okay, dude.
- Dude is not an improvement.
-  - Oh, boy, they're here.
- Oh, now, honey, I know you're nervous, but it's gonna be fine.
We can handle ourselves.
Hola.
Feliz Thanksgiving.
Jake told me you were Cuban.
Yes, I did, and I regret it.
Come on in.
So nice to finally meet you.
I'm Victor.
- And I'm Camila.
- Oh.
- And you brought a turkey?
- Sure did.
Even though I told her that you were making the turkey, and all she needed to bring was stuffing.
The stuffing's inside it and now we have two turkeys, - just in case.
- In case of what?
I don't know.
Anyway, it was in the car when she picked me up.
- Isn't that fun?
- The most fun.
Why don't we just get comfortable.
- My dad is just - Hey, Kare-bear, - which pants do you think - Dad!
- Honey.
- The Santiagos are here.
Feliz Thanksgiving.
How was the trip in?
The flight must have been awful.
- Hey, Dad?
- This holiday is the worst.
Could we just press pause on that and maybe get some pants?
Fine.
I'll put on some pants.
Thanks.
Squad, bullpen, now.
- Is everything okay, sir?
- No, it is not.
I went to a meeting and when I returned, my pie was gone.
Which one of you took it?
Calm down, there's no need to point fingers.
At us.
It was clearly Hitchcock and Scully.
How dare you.
You have no proof.
There's crumbs all over your desks.
Well, these aren't pie crumbs.
Bread, cookie, pizza, sandwich, blintz, and one good old fashioned potato chip.
No pie here.
I just humiliated you.
Look, this doesn't have to be a big deal.
Whoever took that pie, come forward and all will be forgiven.
Smart.
You knew I would never forgive you.
But you're dumb if you think I won't get to the bottom of this.
Everyone here is a suspect.
Okay, not off to a great start.
My mom brought a passive-aggressive turkey and we all saw your dad's penis through his undies.
What?
You did?
Why were you looking?
No, I wasn't.
It all happened so fast.
Hey, everyone, I'm sorry for not being "dressed".
I didn't think you guys were gonna be so early.
We arrived at the agreed upon time.
Right.
So, like, super early.
Convo grease.
Convo grease them right now.
Yes.
Mrs. Peralta, I love this new ceramic that you painted.
You know, my mom paints as well.
- Really?
- Yes.
- I paint on canvases though.
- Oh.
- And that's different?
- Very.
- Completely.
- I just always found canvas to be too restricting.
For me with bowls and vases and furniture, the world is my canvas.
Yes, and for me, with canvas, the canvas is my canvas.
- She said "canvas" so much.
- Who wants to hear a joke?
Do you mean like a riddle?
'Cause I love riddles.
No, I mean like a joke joke, where I say it and you laugh.
No, then I'm not interested.
Oh.
Well golf.
Yes, golf.
Anyone hit the links lately?
- I don't play golf.
- What are you talking about?
You played it all the time when I was a kid.
- Never played golf in my life.
- Jake, your remembering when he used to pretend to golf so that he could spend his Sunday's cheating on me.
- Ah.
- Oh, yeah.
- Oops.
- But it's okay now.
We're happy, we're back together - We're cool.
- And, you know, all relationships have rough patches.
- Right, Camila?
- No.
- Jake.
- Hair.
We all have hair.
Mm.
Okay, this is bad.
None of the convo grease worked.
We need a new plan.
There's gotta be some way - to make them get along.
- Maybe we could play a game.
No.
No games.
My dad gets super competitive.
He used to flip out on me when I beat him at Adult Clue.
It was the only board game he had at his condo.
All the murder weapons were sex toys.
Oh, okay.
You know what?
Actually, my dad is super competitive too.
It's bad.
He got kicked off a bird watching tour once.
- Look a kingfisher.
- No, no, no, no, no.
That's the same bird I saw earlier.
That doesn't count.
Yikes.
All right, so it's agreed.
We steer clear of all competition.
Why can't there be some magic potion that makes everyone happy and have fun all the time?
?
Who wants some alcohol?
-  - Thank you very much, David.
That'll be all.
There are no prints on the box, no DNA evidence, and the security camera in my office was obscured, which means whoever took my pie thought it through.
And that means It wasn't Hitchcock and Scully.
Exactly.
Now, as for you three, I think it's time we had a little chat.
How long you been planning this?
A day?
A week?
A year?
Or is this the only reason you joined the force to begin with?
So you think I became a cop just so I can steal your pie?
Your words not mine.
No, don't tell me why you did it.
- Tell him.
- You want me to talk to this picture of your husband?
Look him in the eye and tell him what you did.
- I didn't do it, Kevin.
- Don't you say his name.
No, Terry, I'm not mad at you.
I know you didn't mean to do it.
You just got hungry, and that's the most natural thing in the world.
- I didn't take your pie.
- You're lying!
If you're so innocent, where were you - when the pie went missing?
- I was at the grocery store buying goose feet for Nikolaj's dinner.
I was getting the oil changed in my bike.
Preparing for my solo Thanksgiving ride.
I was at the gym.
Ava's birthday/Thanksgiving dinner's a high-caloric affair.
Terry needs to earn that feast.
Everybody has an alibi.
How convenient.
So I hope you're comfortable because I will keep you in here - all day if necessary!
-  We need the room to question someone - about the Red Hook homicide.
- Oh, no problem.
- We'll be right out.
- Okay, we are one glass in.
My mom's telling a story about my birth and your parents are not recoiling.
Good.
Let's keep it going.
I think we need to top 'em off.
A-top them off.
Every night I'm told what to do and every morning I do what I'm told, but yet I cannot escape your scold.
What am I?
An alarm clock.
Oh, I get it.
So a riddle is just like a fact that's told in a really confusing way.
- Exactly.
- Hey, I used to fly - with Sully Sullenberger.
- What he did was amazing.
Between us, I could have landed that plane on the ground at the destination without killing any of those birds.
-  - Is my dad playing piano?
And is my dad scatting?
- This is amazing.
- Oh, my.
Who wants more wine?
No, no, no, no, no more for me.
In fact, I think everyone here has had enough.
- We have?
- Yes.
-  - Now we're drinking this.
Rum from Cuba.
-  - Rum from Cuba!
I saw what you did this morning when you deduced the contents of my bakery box.
Impressive.
Now I need to use your skills to find my pie.
It's about time you came to us.
Here's what we need from you.
A list of the pie's ingredients.
We're looking for anything that might linger - on someone's breath.
- We need surveillance footage from the water fountain, the crumb consistency was dry.
Whoever ate it's gonna be thirsty.
Now what kind of crimped edge are we dealing with here?
- U-shaped or V?
- I don't know.
Well, then get on the damned phone and find out.
Babe, our parents are vibing hard.
Drinking just makes people get along better.
Do you think if I got my parents drunk every day when I was a kid they would have stayed together and we would have had a happy family?
- Probably.
Yeah.
- Right.
Yeah.
-  - I'd like to say a few words.
Camila and I thrilled to welcome you into our family, so allow me to be the first to bless this union with a toast.
- To Jake and Amy.
-  To Jake and Amy.
Aww, thanks, Dad.
That was really sweet.
- I have a toast too.
- Oh.
Karen and I would like to welcome you into our family.
And allow me to be the first to say that we love you.
To Jake and Amy.
Congratulations.
To Jake and Amy.
- Thanks, Dad.
- I'd like to go again.
Uh-oh, they're getting competitive.
It goes without saying, I love you both.
- But you didn't say it.
- I'd just like to add, if there's anything you ever need, the Santiago's are here for you.
- To Jake and Amy.
- Round two.
Oh, that seems like plenty, Dad.
No, if Victor gets two toasts, - then I do too.
-  I would like to go one step further and say that if there is anything that you need or want the Peralta's are there for you.
That doesn't sound like a better offer than mine.
Yeah, it is.
It's a lot better than yours.
Jake I'll give you my grandfather's watch.
You are now a Santiago.
I would like to pay for the wedding.
Amy, you are now my daughter.
-  What?
- I win.
To Jake and Amy.
Oh, no.
There are downsides to alcohol.
Well, that was a lovely series of toasts, Now who can I interest in 12 cups of coffee?
No, I'd like to know what Roger meant when he said he would pay for the wedding.
How much are you willing to give them?
- Whatever they need.
- You know it's tradition - for the bride's family to pay.
- It's also tradition for the host to make the turkey.
- Okay, guys - Bottom line is, we appreciate the offer, but we're paying.
No, you gave him the watch.
That was your gift.
Maybe we should just split the wedding.
It's a great idea, Mom.
Given your financial situation.
- No.
- What's that supposed to mean?
Our financial "situation"?
You know, I think we probably all had just about enough of this delicious rum.
I'm gonna dump it out into this plant.
-  - That's a $600 bottle.
$527.
I looked it up online.
If you paid $600, you're making some bad choices, my friend.
All right, it's dinner time.
Everybody go wash your hands.
I'd never said that before.
Amy, you come with me.
This is a nightmare.
This is worse than my sixth birthday party when I caught my dad making out with a female clown in the bounce house.
Oh, my dad is the worst.
I know.
He's ruining the whole day.
Yeah, but, you know, don't just blame my dad.
You literally just said he's the worst.
I know.
It's okay when I say it.
You have to pretend like he's cool.
Those are the rules.
Plus, you gotta admit, your parents were being a little condescending.
Why?
Because they asked what was in the dip - that seemed to be just mayo?
- All dip is just mayo.
Yes, but no, what I was referring to was the fact that your mom brought her own hand towels.
As if my mom wouldn't have washed hers knowing - they had guests coming over?
- Did she?
No, you don't have to.
They're only touched by freshly cleaned hands.
- They never get dirty.
- Wow.
The unhygienic apple doesn't fall far from the unhygienic tree.
Did you just call my mom a tree?
I called her an unhygienic tree.
Wow.
Wow.
All right, you know what?
Let's just go back in there and enjoy our joyous Thanksgiving and hopefully no one's parents will ruin it.
Fine.
Well, I know that my parents aren't gonna ruin any joyousness.
In fact, they're gonna be joyous as hell.
Not nearly as joyous as my parents.
Thank you, all, for joining me.
I checked into your alibis.
Or should I say alib-lies!
Diaz, if you were changing the oil in your bike for your big ride up the coast, then tell me, why is your tank only half full?
- You dipsticked my bike?
- That's not all I dipsticked.
Mr. Fit, or should I call you by your real name?
Mr. Fib.
I find it quite odd that you were building up an appetite at the gym when your gym is closed on Thanksgiving.
And, Boyle, out buying goose feet - for Nickolaj?
- Nikolaj.
I found your grocery store receipt.
No feet of any kind.
But there was one purchase, a beverage that pairs perfectly with pie.
One gallon of milk!
This heist took three people.
Lady Dipstick, Mr. Fib, and the Milk Man.
The jig is up.
Confess.
- Okay, I lied.
- Thank you.
Not about the pie.
About my Thanksgiving.
I'm not spending it alone.
I'm spending it with my family.
We're seeing the new "Minions" musical on Broadway.
And I wasn't putting oil in my bike.
I was picking up these matching T-shirts for my whole family.
-  - I missed my family a lot when I was in prison and we've gotten really close again.
I was embarrassed about how pumped I am to see them.
The T-shirts were my idea.
Okay.
It was a two-man job.
No, I didn't steal your pie either.
I lied about the gym because I was still trying to find a Perry the Parrot for Ava.
I forgot it was her birthday coming up and by the time I realized, the dumb toy was all sold out.
I just didn't want you guys to know what a horrible dad I really am.
Well, now we do.
Boyle?
Nikolaj is a picky eater!
I lied about his pallet.
All he drinks is milk.
All he eats is buttered noodles.
- And perhaps my walnut pie?
- I wish.
He hates nuts.
My son is a basic bitch.
So none of you took my pie.
Captain, you're gonna wanna see this.
Their desks were clean, so we expanded the search radius.
Take a look.
My pie, and it wasn't even eaten.
Just thrown away like common street trash.
Makes me sick.
Spend your life on the force, and it never gets easier.
Wow, Mom, what a delightful dinner.
I mean, these have gotta be the most joyous green beans - I've ever seen.
- Oh, thanks, honey.
- They're pre-made from a can.
- Great.
Shall we carve the turkey?
Get this dinner started?
I'm an excellent carver.
Allow me.
I think I can carve the turkey.
After all, it is my house and sitting right here in front of me.
We have two turkeys.
- You can both carve one.
- Yes, thank goodness for the second turkey, a very normal thing to have brought.
This is actually very good because now everybody could see - who cuts the turkey better.
- You're on.
- Wow.
Really mature.
- You're just saying that because you know my dad's gonna win.
- As if.
- Hey, Roger, You like jokes.
Here's one.
I'd hate to be a passenger on one of your flights if you fly as slow as you cut a turkey.
Riddle me this, Victor.
Who sucks at carving turkey, thinks their rum is good when it's bad?
You.
Up top, Jake.
- Joyous.
- Uh, Camila, did you put your stuffing in my ceramic?
- I thought it was a bowl.
- It's art.
-  - What does that mean?
- What did she say?
- She said it was a bowl.
Bet you didn't know I understood Spanish.
Very impressive.
You learn that from one of your mistresses?
Yeah.
As a matter of fact, I did.
Sounds like someone's jealous.
- I bet you never even had sex.
- Oh, I've had sex.
And I'm actually pretty good.
Camila?
- The best.
- What is happening right now?
Roger's really good at sex too.
- Ha, ha, I'm so grossed out.
- You know what?
I'm sick of you looking down your nose at us.
I know the Peralta's aren't perfect, but we don't look down on other people.
I mean, you come into our home and you act like we're idiots.
Well, we're not idiots.
In fact - I just cut my thumb off.
- What?
I just cut my thumb off.
- Oh, my God!
-  I think it's It's bad.
Excuse me, my father cut his thumb off.
- We need help right now.
- Do you have the thumb?
Yeah, I got it right here.
It's in a plastic baggy.
It's not just sitting on the ice cream.
Okay, just fill out these forms.
Someone will be with you in a bit.
I think this might be it for me, little man.
There's something you gotta know, Jake.
- You have three half-sisters.
- What?
One in Atlanta, one in Newark, one in Dallas Fort Worth.
All the hubs.
Okay, we have to get him help right now.
He can't die.
I've gotta hear more about this.
It's a holiday, we're understaffed, we'll get to your father eventually.
He needs help now!
You know who this man is?
Captain Roger Peralta.
He taught Sully Sullenberger how to fly.
It's just that we're understaffed.
No excuses.
You're going to take this man to the OR right now or I'm gonna sue you - and everybody in this hospital.
-  Uh, go with him.
- I love you, buddy.
- Oh.
- Thanks, that's nice.
- I love you, nurse.
I love you lady in the scarf.
Significantly less meaningful.
- I love you candy machine.
- Victor, that was amazing.
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Of course.
Your mom and Camila are on the way.
They're still cleaning up all the blood.
Yeah, there was so much.
They might have to move.
Babe, I'm really sorry about all the things I said.
- You know, I didn't mean it.
- Yeah, me neither.
And, look, this is all my fault.
I just wanted a big family Thanksgiving, and I forced it, so it's on me.
But, look, I love you, and Is that still your dad's thumb?
Oh, my God, yes.
He needs this.
Nurse?
Hello, Raymond.
Ready to go to dinner?
Yes, but I have some unfortunate news about our pie.
- It was thrown away.
- No.
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.
- And I know who did it.
- Who?
You all bragged about your Thanksgiving plans.
Why?
You were overcompensating.
Trying to cover up your dark secrets, but there was one other person who was also overcompensating.
You.
Kevin.
Even better than a plain scone.
Plain scone.
Plain scone.
I should have known you were lying.
There's nothing better than a plain scone.
- This is ridiculous.
- Is it?
Look how the pie was disposed of.
Placed gently with two hands inside the bin.
That's exactly how you always throw away garbage.
- It is?
- There's only one thing I still can't figure out.
- Why'd you do it?
- Because it's disgusting.
- Oh, my.
- That pie is an abomination.
It has beef suet and apple seeds in it.
Why?
It's a walnut pie.
If we brought that to my family's house, hey would have said something.
- I was trying to protect you.
- Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
Because I love our annual trips to Saratoga Springs.
The two of us driving in silence, looking at the barren trees.
It's perfect.
I I didn't wanna lose that.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know why we can't still make the drive next year.
We just don't have to buy the pie.
A trip with no purpose?
Raymond - Hey, Dad, how's it going?
- I'm fine.
They reattached my thumb.
Oh, that's great.
So you'll be able to fly again?
Yeah, that was never in doubt.
You don't need thumbs to fly anymore.
You just hit one button.
The plane takes care of the rest.
I have to believe that's not true.
Oh, looks like Mom's already tuckered out.
Yeah, you know how tired she gets when she drinks.
- She won't be up for 12 hours.
- Hey, Jake, you know how you said you always wanted to have a big family Thanksgiving?
I had five brothers, three sisters, four aunts, and 12 cousins who spent every holiday together.
I had the kind of family that you dream of.
Oh, are you done?
That seemed like a really mean place to stop, but you're taking a long pause.
- When we all were together - Ah.
Huge mess.
I can't tell you how many holidays I spent in an ER.
-  - But that's what it means to have a big family.
Like this one.
Oh.
Well, thank you, Victor.
And apparently my family's a lot bigger than I thought.
How many half sisters did you say I have, Dad?
I only told you about the sisters?
- Come on.
- Roger, I want to apologize to you for being so defensive about you wanting to pay for the wedding.
I'm sorry too.
It was stupid.
I was just feeling insecure because 'Cause I gave Jake the watch?
I was gonna say because you saw my penis through my underpants, but the watch, yeah, sure.
I was thinking, if you wanna pay for the wedding, it would be fine, but we can split it.
It's up to you.
That seems fair.
You're a good dude.
Come here, give me a hug.
Give me a hug me.
Hug me.
- Bring it in.
- Oh, Jake, it's happening.
The weird but good dad hug.
Oh, it's magical.
- Best Thanksgiving ever.
-  Yep, Dad, your gown's riding up.
- Oh.
- It's out.
- Ooh, I - It's out.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 Hey, Jake, guess who just called me?
The Jerky Boys.
They're back!
No.
What?
- No.
- No.
D.C. Parlov.
He's in town for LegendCon, and he has a case for us!
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!
Parlov?
Didn't he write those "Skyfire" books?
I thought he turned out to be a jerk.
Yeah, but ever since Jake and I saved his life, he's actually been very nice.
He even sent me a Christmas gift.
A full-scale replica of the sword of Opadoma.
- Unh!
- Why are you so excited?
You don't care about those stupid books.
I actually did read all of them in prison.
They are the greatest books I've ever read, and I've read "Cujo".
Jake and I really bonded over "Skyfire".
- Yeah.
- Watch this.
Favorite moment in the series?
The summoning of Balacastro.
- Second favorite?
-  The Scarlet Feast!
- Third favorite?
-  When you thought Ka'lar had been swallowed by the Norolith, but had just switched armor with Samling the Betrayer in the battle of Vorcastle.
Fourth favorite?
Three was plenty.
So was zero.
Okay, I can see that you're skeptical, Rosa, but how about this: come with us on the case!
I know you think it's dumb, but "Skyfire" is actually very smart and dark and adult.
It's not for nerds at all.
Ooh!
On our way there, should we sing the elvish hunting song?
Sharpen your swords And string your bows The beasts have gone away  Whoa, look at this place!
Ooh, they're selling moss wine.
I wonder if it's as gross as the books say it is.
I can never get into any of this crap.
I think the reason is because it's garbage.
Rosa, I think if you just gave it a chance, you would get hooked.
I mean, what is it that you do in your free time that's so cool?
Fix up old cars and sell them to celebrities.
That's why I'm friends with Tom Hardy.
Right, so we agree that we're all equally cool.
Here we go.
This is Parlov's panel.
"Diversity in Fantasy Writing".
Ooh, the line starts here.
Real diverse diversity panel.
And, like, people always ask me, "Where do you get your ideas"?
And honestly, Wikipedia.
I always try to pull from life.
Queen Tiffany, of course, was named after a lovely hostess that I met in Bonita Springs in Florida.
You know, I've always wanted to write a book myself, but all I know about is cops, and there are literally no more cop stories to tell.
Zero.
- I've actually been writing a novel.
- Wait, what?
You're writing a book?
When?
For who?
For me for fun.
Look, I'm not trying to be an author.
I don't even know how to go about doing that.
Parlov!
You should show it to Parlov.
- He could probably get it published.
- No, that's crazy.
Like, I'm sure it's bad.
I don't want to be embarrassed.
Terry, you are a great husband, father, detective, painter, dancer, and you're so jacked you have muscles on your back.
Everyone has back muscles, Jake.
Nuh-huh, my back looks like the inside of a spoon.
The point is, you're great at everything.
You're probably great at writing, too.
I am not showing Parlov my book, okay?
All right.
Here he comes.
Now just drop it.
Sorry, I hope that wasn't too tedious for you.
It was fascinating, especially to Terry.
- He's a writer, and he wrote a book.
- Would you read it?
-  Dude!
- Sure.
Love to, absolutely.
But listen, there's something I want you to see.
Come with me, guys, all right?
- Jake!
- What?
Terry, you need to believe in yourself, like when Morzak answered the sorceress' riddle!
She turned him into a tree, Jake.
Yeah, a tree that became the handle of Prominius' axe.
Parlov is so far away already.
Yeah, good call.
Let's go after him.
Hey.
The desk sergeant said we're hosting a forensic sciences course.
Yes, taught by Dr. Ronald Yee.
He revolutionized the field of forensic entomology.
He is a rock star.
Oh, please.
Rock stars wish they were he.
The man can tell how long a corpse had been decomposing just by studying the maggots inside.
I'd like to see Barbra Streisand do that.
I'm not sure Barbra Streisand counts as a rock star, sir.
She sings in English.
That's rock music.
Well, it sounds interesting.
Can I sign up?
Yes, you can, but here's the thing: if we do well at this course, we receive board certification, which makes us eligible to receive a grant to open a field lab in the precinct, but Eh but whenever we have a speaker come in, you kind of tend to always derail these things with personal stories.
That's how I learn.
I relate course material to my experiences.
Subjective learning.
Millennials.
I know it's important, so I promise, I won't tell any stories, though sometimes they do come in handy.
One time, all the Boyles were in this fungus cavern, and this massive mushroom comes - Charles.
- I am so sorry.
I slipped right into it.
I'll be good.
This is my room, right over here.
Listen, I need just a moment to clean up.
I had a female visitor in earlier today dressed as Concubina.
She got smears of green body paint all over everything.
Everything.
He was talking about his penis.
- I know, Jake.
- He pulls, Rosa.
- He pulls.
That's all I'm saying.
- I can't believe you - told him about my book.
- I'm sorry, Terry, but now D.C. Parlov is going to read what you wrote!
How cool is that?
- He's pretty cool.
- Right?
You haven't even told me what it's about yet.
Well, it's the story of a Gorgon warrior - Awesome.
- Who betrays his bloodline - How could he?
- To marry a Cloud Princess - He did it for love.
- Even though - their families are at war.
- No!
All right, no more spoilers.
Send it over to me, and I'm gonna stay up all night reading it.
- It's only 150 pages.
- I'm gonna stay up all the next three nights reading it.
Dr. Yee will be here any minute, and we need to make a good impression.
If you need to cough Cough now.
My God, what if I hadn't said anything?
Don't worry, I got this.
Nobody sucks up like a Boyle.
Our scoliosis allows us to bow more deeply than normal people.
Huh, here's an idea: Santiago and I will impress him with the depth of our forensic knowledge, and you can wow him with your stoic, silent demeanor.
No stories.
Understood?
Stoic.
Ah.
Good morning, everyone.
Thank you for having me at the Nine-Nine.
Sorry I'm late.
Just had to deal with some family issues.
Cousins, right?
Okay, before we get technical, let's talk a bit about the history of blood.
Does anyone here know any hemophiliacs?
So many Now, they played a vital role in the development of modern forensics.
Them and leeches.
My cousin Torvald is a hemophiliac, and his wife is a leech farmer.
I say "wife," but it's a common-law marriage.
For the longest time, Boyle wedding ceremonies were not recognized in the state.
- - Well, here's the situation: somebody stole my laptop, which contained the unpublished manuscript of book 13 of "The Skyfire Cycle".
The person left this note.
"We have your book.
"Pay us $500,000 in the next 24 hours "or we leak it online.
"The first five chapters are now up".
They've been downloaded 85,000 times.
Well, we should probably go online and read those chapters in case there's some clues in there, and also maybe we'll find out Qwandor's true parentage?
- Oh that's already been revealed.
- No, it hasn't.
Unless the prophecy of Dorgon is indeed true!
- But that would mean - You seem pretty calm for somebody - whose book was just stolen.
- Because I know who took it.
- Landon Lawson.
- He was on that panel.
He writes "The Shadowbringer Saga".
It's garbage.
So why would Lawson want to steal your manuscript?
We both have books coming out this fall, and we have a rather public bet about whose is going to sell better.
I believe he's leaking my manuscript online just to hurt my sales.
- You should arrest him.
- Well, we're not going to do anything until we've seen all the evidence.
If this book fails, that's the end of "Skyfire".
Let's go take this son of a bitch down!
Mr. Lawson?
NYPD.
Let me guess: you're here about the stolen manuscript?
So you admit you did it?
Well, that was easy.
What?
No.
Someone stole my manuscript, and I know who it was: D.C. Parlov.
By Zorton's Sword!
It's the exact same note Parlov got.
I don't see why anybody would want to steal your book.
"The Skyfire Cycle" makes "The Shadowbringer Saga" look like "The BeastWorm Chronicles".
You see, Rosa, "The BeastWorm Chronicles" are one of the more simplistic - Don't care.
- Yeah.
You know what?
My books say something, okay?
I was the only one brave enough to tackle elf molestation.
Guys, calm down.
You're both victims.
Now, do you have any enemies in common?
Let me think about that.
Parlov is my enemy, but he's also his own enemy, because he's such a boring and repetitive writer.
He just keeps killing off characters, resurrecting them, and killing 'em off again.
Because of the Chrysalis Orb!
Uh, sorry.
Police officer, on a case.
But we will need you to both generate actual lists of people that might want to hurt you.
We have 24 hours to figure this out, but if we don't, are you willing to pay the ransom?
I'd do anything to get my book back.
I mean, you understand.
You're a writer.
Do you hear that, Terry?
He called you a writer.
Terry, did you hear?
Terry?
Well, Terry's broken.
Write up those lists.
We're on the case.
- - Welcome back.
So today, I want to focus on facial reconstruction.
For over a century, we used plaster casts to help identify decomposed John and Jane Does.
We buried my Nana Boyle at the family farm, but because of the soil's high salt content, she turned into jerky.
Never mind.
- Please continue.
- Now, I need one person per group to have a plaster cast made of their head.
Uh, will he or she Be able to speak?
Not while the plaster's on, no.
- I vote Charles.
- Charles.
I was gonna vote me, too.
I mean, I know the plaster can dry out your skin, but as a Boyle, I'm aggressively moist.
Oop, you gotta close that mouth, Boyle.
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
Keep still and quiet.
Have you been here all night?
We traded off, and each slept a few hours right here in the break room, but we got a lead.
You know Miles Moorgil?
He wrote "The Nocturine Quartet" novels.
Well, Moorgil is the only person on both Parlov and Lawson's lists of potential enemies.
Apparently, they each slept with his wife.
How do these guys do so well with women?
Oh, I'm sorry they don't live up to your superficial standards of male beauty, Rosa.
I'm kidding.
It's because they're rich.
Moorgil's here for the conference.
We're gonna go confront him and get the laptops back.
Then, maybe, we can see if Parlov read my book yet.
Oh, well, I mean, it's been less than a day.
- Maybe don't get your hopes up.
- Don't worry.
I don't have any expectations.
- Good.
- I'm gonna be at my phone, just in case a publisher calls.
I mean, someone.
Yeah.
Whatever.
It's fine.
My hopes are up.
All right, buddy.
I couldn't sleep last night, so I started reading Terry's book, and it's terrible.
I made him show it to Parlov.
He's gonna be humiliated.
Relax.
How bad could it be?
So bad, and I'm entertained by everything.
I once went to a play.
So what are you gonna do about Parlov?
- I don't know.
- Don't know what?
Uh, how to do Sex good.
How much should I be flapping my arms around?
- Not much.
- Right.
Well, that settles that.
I knew that Amy was wrong.
Anyways, let's get back on the case, right?
Skyfire Cycle.
Okay, now that the plaster's dry, you'll see why we lubricated the subject's face with Vaseline first.
Oh, no, we forgot the lube.
Charles, can you hear us?
What do we do?
Doctor?
Uh, what if someone No one in this room, mind you Forgot to lubricate before applying the plaster?
Oh, one of my lab techs made that mistake once.
It becomes impossible to remove the mask without literally skinning the subject alive.
It takes five days for the plaster to slough off on its own.
And what became of the lab tech?
Oh, I fired him.
It was an unacceptable level of incompetence.
Huh, what a satisfying conclusion to that story.
- Boyle!
-  Mm.
A mistake was made and we can't remove your mask yet.
We're gonna leave you in here Until after the class is over, because if Dr. Yee sees you like this, we can kiss our certification good-bye.
I'm sorry, Boyle, but Hitchcock and Scully will be here with you.
I don't know, Captain.
He seems pretty upset.
- Hold on.
-  Mm!
Look how happy he is now.
Yes, you're welcome, Boyle.
I don't understand.
Why do you think I would steal those laptops?
Parlov and Lawson are your rivals.
You're jealous of their success.
And of course, you have a personal motive.
You hate them for sleeping with your wife.
- What?
They slept with my wife?
- And you didn't know.
Well, this is awkward.
We should probably just go.
- Jessica!
- She's here.
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, sweets?
Did you sleep with D.C. Parlov and Landon Lawson?
- Uh - Why would you do that?
You've ruined our marriage.
You've ruined it!
You know, this seems like a conversation for just you two, so oop, here comes a child.
Mommy?
Daddy?
Are you getting divorced?
Are they getting divorced?
Uh Oof.
Okay, that was a rough 70 minutes.
- Yeah, but - That kid looked exactly like Parlov?
100%.
Oh Anyways, that was our last lead, so looks like we're back at the Nil Caverns.
- Did you just say the Nil Caverns?
- Hm?
- Like, from my book?
- Uh, yep.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, I did, because you told me about them when you were explaining the plot.
I didn't, but that's because I wanted the Nil Caverns to be a surprise.
Why didn't you tell me you read my book, Jake?
- Uh - Oh, no.
- You hated it.
- What?
Terry, no, I didn't hate it.
- I liked tons of parts.
- Name one.
Name one part you liked, Jake.
- The map?
- I didn't draw that!
It was a map of the Chesapeake Bay with the names slightly changed!
Oh, my God.
You made me show Parlov.
You humiliated me in front of my hero!
Sarge, I'm sorry.
Look, I didn't just like the map.
I also liked the spaces between the words!
That's not helpful.
You guys got a million dollars together on 24 hours' notice?
Yeah, I had to liquidate my Bitcoins.
Oh, really?
I would've thought you'd be flushed with cash from the "Skyfire" TV series.
Oh, wait, that's right.
The CW passed.
How's the "Shadowbringer" film coming along?
Howie Long still playing both twins?
All right.
Let's go over the plan.
Okay, there's a potted tree on the east side of the lobby.
They said to leave the briefcase behind that.
If someone grabs it, Rosa, Peralta, and I will converge.
We'll be positioned around the room in disguise.
It's not gonna work.
I don't own a nerd costume.
Oh, but Rosa, you are already wearing one.
You naturally dress like the female bounty hunter in every steampunk novel.
Look.
All you need are welding goggles.
Damn it.
I have welding goggles in the car.
Shall we to battle?
Mask on, mask on Mask, mask on Got your mask on, mask on Represent, yeah, gotta represent To solve that problem, we would use fluid dynamic analysis.
That is exactly right.
Well done.
Where's your friend?
Shouldn't he be here for the plaster removal?
Something came up, so he had to remove the mask, which came off quite easily, and run out.
It was urgent police business.
Bunch of kids are being held hostage, so he had to go deal with that.
Oh, well, if you need to leave to provide him with backup - No, it's a teachable moment.
- The children - can handle themselves.
- Captain Holt?
Your husband's on the phone.
He wants to know how long you're going to kiss for tonight?
Would you excuse us for one moment?
Your husband didn't really call.
I wasn't sure what gay guys talk about on the phone.
How'd I do?
Scully, what do you want?
We were watching Charles, like you said, but both of us had to go to the bathroom really bad.
Ugh.
Where's Charles?
- We have no idea.
-  What?
- Terry, do you copy?
- I copy.
- Seriously?
You're still mad at me?
- All I said was "I copy".
Yeah, but you had a tone.
Just admit it.
- Let it go, Jake.
- No, he's right.
Terry had a tone.
- Terry had a big-time tone.
- Don't worry.
I bet he hasn't even read your book yet.
It's been two hours.
I'm almost at the front of this line.
I don't even know who I'm waiting to take a picture with.
"Bran Stark"?
Pass.
Okay, he's just the three-eyed raven.
Here we go, here we go.
We got action.
He dresses just like you, Jake.
Is that someone popular?
Yes, Rosa, it's Ka'lar.
17th of his name, sworn knight of the Queen's Crown, the Daybreaker, the rightful heir to All right.
You can just say "Ka'lar".
Uh, then how will you know which Ka'lar I'm talking about?
It's a very common name in "Skyfire".
It's like their John.
He's going for the briefcase.
Okay, let's go.
Don't make your move until you're close to him.
There's too many civilians.
Wait, why are there so many Ka'lars?
Costume contest just ended.
That's why he waited until now to pick up the money.
I lost him.
Which one is it?
It's the one headed toward the service elevator.
Hey!
Freeze!
NYPD.
Let me see your hands.
What's going on?
Doesn't have the briefcase.
I got the wrong Ka'lar.
- I have eyes on him.
- Take him down!
Wrong Ka'lar Boyle's not in the interrogation room.
He couldn't have gotten far.
He can't see.
You can go a long way on muscle memory alone.
One time, I sleepwalked - to the M&M's store in Times Square.
-  Oh, oh!
Stairwell.
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- I'm okay.
It's okay.
Sorry, stranger.
I just can't see anything at all, and it's really scary being touched.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
Just return me to the 99th precinct.
Boyle, it's us.
Where were you going?
Why would you leave that windowless supply closet we locked you in?
Ah, yes, hearing it, I understand why.
I was trying to get to the locker room to steam the mask off in the shower so you guys could still get certified.
Wait.
You were trying to help us?
Even though you'll be stuck in this mask for five days?
Five days?
Well, I know how important the course was to you.
It's not.
- Not anymore.
-  I'm so sorry.
I just cannot see at all.
I can't believe it!
Now I'm out $1/2 million!
What am I supposed to do now?
Write another "Compendium of Beasts"?
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find enough interns to slap that crap together?
God!
Don't worry about him.
At least we got to stop that thief from releasing any more chapters.
All we're out is some money, plus I've got insurance, so I'm going to get it all back.
By the way, Detective Jeffords, while we were waiting, I had an opportunity to read your manuscript.
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's a work in progress.
Has a lot of changes I No, no, no, it was great.
Truly.
Fantastic.
I mean, it was so fresh, you know?
It had a really unique point of view.
I sent it on to my publishers.
Thank you for allowing me to read it.
And I want to thank you all for your hard, hard work on this case.
Appreciate it.
Ooh, did you hear that?
He loved it.
D.C. Parlov loved my writing!
You were wrong!
And being wrong never felt so right.
Oh, that sounded cool.
Did I just make up a hit song?
Being wrong never felt so right With the Addams Family staying up all night Yep, I was right.
It's a hit.
I gotta go call Sharon!
All righty.
Well, congratulations, Sarge!
And don't forget about us when you become a famous author.
Terry's writing sucks.
Parlov is lying to him.
- What?
Why?
- I don't know.
He's buttering him up because Lawson and Parlov stole their own books!
Well, they stole their own books It's plain to see But who's on the case The Addams Family Terry is Gomez, I'm Cousin It You are Wednesday, let's do this Okay, we should go.
Why do you think these guys are in it together?
They hate each other.
They spent an hour arguing over the name of the dragon in "The Hobbit".
- "Smog".
- "Smowg".
- Smog!
- Smowg!
-  Smog!
-  Smowg!
It's "Smowg," by the way Point Lawson but yes, they're mortal enemies, which is why they think we'll never suspect them of being in cahoots.
Oh, but they cahooted, Rosa.
They cahooted all over us.
Gross.
Why'd they leak their chapters?
To get people excited, like when Carly Rae Jepsen puts out an amazing single, and you have to wait six weeks for the album to come out.
She's great.
I'm not apologizing.
So Parlov contacted Terry because he knows Sarge is a super-fan and can be manipulated.
Yes, he's been giving Terry presents since last year.
And Terry's novel gave Parlov another chance to manipulate him.
Unless is it possible Parlov actually likes Sarge's writing?
Read the first sentence.
- Yep, Parlov did it.
- Very much so.
Gah!
Now I have to tell Sarge that his fantasy novel stinks.
This is the hardest part of being a cop.
Now, there are issues with RFLP testing, as there are with every technique, but Captain, I thought you said your friend removed his mask and left.
I forgot to lube up his face.
We failed to listen to the instructions.
That is incredibly careless.
I know, and it means we won't receive our certification, and I'm okay with that.
- Unless my honesty - No, it's off the table.
- And I'm okay with that.
- Well, anyway, RFLP testing was designed to localize genetic disorders, and it Ooh, my cousin Donna has a genetic disorder where her lips were made of cartilage, meaning her mouth is technically a beak.
I don't see how that pertains to anything No, let him talk.
I want to hear it.
Boyle, tell us about your cousin's beak.
Well, she runs marathons to raise money for other people afflicted with "bird-face".
There are only two of them.
- They're her kids.
- Oh, Sarge!
Funny seeing you here.
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to tell you something.
What was it?
Out with it, Peralta.
Okay, fine.
Here it goes.
- I think that - Parlov hated my book.
He only said he liked it so I wouldn't figure out he and Lawson stole their own manuscripts.
- You figured it out.
- Well, I had a gut feeling, so I went digging.
I got a warrant for Parlov's browser history.
He searched "how to liquidate Bitcoins" three days before the laptops were stolen.
Man, I bet that browser history was a nightmare, huh?
- Oh, you have no idea.
- Yeah.
Anyway, I questioned them, and they confessed.
I can't go to prison, okay?
I know I seem tough, but I'm not.
- I went to Bennington.
- Ew.
I'm sorry Parlov didn't like your book.
And I didn't.
And also Rosa.
- Why did I add that?
- No, it's okay.
At least I won't waste any more time trying to be a writer.
Wait, let me ask you a question.
Are you a better cop now than when you started?
- Nope.
- Wasn't talking to you.
Yeah.
I look back at my old cases and I can't believe how long - it took me to figure things out.
- Yeah, but you worked on it, and you kept working, and now, 12 to 40 years later I don't have a good sense of your age You're a great cop who got a "gut feeling" and solved a huge case.
So you think I should keep writing?
I mean, you might not become a huge famous author, but you'll get better, and if it makes you happy, it can't be that bad.
Sheryl Crow, she's great.
I won't apologize.
And who knows?
Claire Essalgorn didn't start writing the first "Crimson Portal" novel until she was 60.
I started reading it because the character looks like me.
I kept reading it because it's so good!
Rosa, you did get hooked, you big nerd!
This heroine is my heroin.
Oh, such a dweebus.
I love it!
Speaking of which, Parlov's laptop is in evidence.
Want to go read the new "Skyfire" book?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, he's such a bad guy.
Do we even like his books anymore?
Sharpen your swords And string your bows
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 - - I'll get back to you guys by the end of the day with all the logistics.
Sergeant Terrance Jeffords, four years ago on this exact date, you told me I was too old to learn how to do the worm.
I vowed on that day to prove you a fool, and today, I shall.
Check it.
I'm on fire!
As I was telling the squad, our old C.O., Captain McGintley, just passed away.
Oh, no.
We're going to Los Angeles for the funeral next week.
I'll have the travel details later.
Hey, has anyone seen a worm?
Because this funky chicken's hungry.
Charles, a man has died.
Read the room!
- - Oh, man.
Sad day.
Sad day.
It's crazy how different things were when McGintley was Captain.
It was like the Wild West.
- Oh, yeah, we had some fun.
- I didn't.
In every one of those photos, I look uptight and worried.
Meanwhile, everyone else looks like they're having the time of their life.
That's because they're all stress-free, not like us Type A's.
Jake, am I too high-strung?
I wouldn't say you're too high-strung.
You just are high-strung.
You know, your strung is what makes you strung.
- You're strung strongly.
- No, not anymore.
From now on, I'm gonna be super chill.
So, where's the party at?
Trick question.
The party's right here, boy!
Oh, hello, Mrs. McGintley.
My condolences for your loss.
So, who do you got your eye on?
- What?
- You haven't dated anyone since you broke up with Pimento.
And funerals are a meat market.
Sadness is a powerful aphrodisiac.
- No, it's not.
- Then how come everyone cries during sex?
I'm already seeing somebody, Boyle.
Oh And just like that, things got interesting.
And just like that, I left.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Oh, Chief Aggerton.
I didn't realize you'd be flying out for this.
I liked McGintley.
He was fun to have a beer with.
There's nobody in this department I wanna have a beer with anymore.
Yes, that's the problem with the NYPD.
So, I hear you're meeting with the Commissioner on Monday morning.
Well, you didn't hear this from me, but Commissioner's retiring next year.
They put a short list together of possible replacements, and you're on it.
- This is your first interview.
- Really?
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- What's going on is Captain Holt has an interview to become the Commissioner of the freakin' NYPD, and he's gonna nail it and fulfill his destiny as Lord High Commander of all Justice.
Okay, let's not get carried away.
Who says I'm even interested in becoming Commissioner?
You, constantly, including the first day I met you.
I'm interested in becoming Commissioner.
- Good to know.
- Fair enough, but even so, it's probably a long shot.
I mean, there are many names on the list.
Nope, just four.
Yeah, three major league jags and you.
Sir, you're the perfect candidate: smart, well-respected, you smell great.
That has nothing to do with the job.
It's just something I've been meaning to tell you.
- Is it sandalwood?
- Please calm down.
Right, totally.
Don't wanna jinx it.
I don't believe in jinxes.
Great, then you won't mind me saying it's a lock.
You're definitely gonna get it, and you're gonna smell even better with that Lord High Commander of all Justice stank on you.
Let's do this - - I can't wait to get on a plane.
I used up my miles, and upgraded first class.
- Damn, Sarge.
- This is gonna be great.
Sipping on a mimosa, snacking on a hummus trio, watching "Bridget Jones's Baby".
- Oh, GPS says turn left here.
- Turn left.
No, this route is more direct.
Oh, okay.
You do you, Commish.
- Please don't call me that.
- Okay, fine, I'll just call you the 'Mish no wait, Mishy Elliot - no wait, Mish-es Doubtfire.
Oh, my God!
-  - What?
What is it?
- Nakatomi Plaza.
It's the most important monument in all of America.
The building from "Die Hard".
Can we go in?
- Can we pay our respects?
- Ooh, our flight leaves in 3 and a half hours, and but it's like, what is time even?
#LegalizeIt.
- Can we go in, sir?
- Fine, just make it quick.
Yes!
Pull in over there, Argyle!
- What?
- That's the name of the driver in the movie.
We're going to Nakatomi Plaza.
There's gonna be role-play.
Oh, my God.
It's even more beautiful than I imagined.
It's an empty floor that's under construction.
Just like in the movie!
Charles, this is the floor that John McClane ran on with his bare feet.
Take my picture with it!
This is the window where John McClane said, "Welcome to the party, pal".
Take my picture with it!
This is the vent where John McClane said, "Come out to the coast.
We'll get together, have a few laughs".
Take my picture with it.
This is the space, where even though it's not really evident in the dialogue, you can tell that John McClane realizes that he should've been a better husband.
Take my picture with it!
Take my picture with it!
Take my picture with it!
Take my picture with it!
But then he unclasps the watch, and Hans falls!
That's a good one.
That's a good one, That's a good one.
That's a good one That's a good one.
Okay, all 600 of these are great.
- We should probably head to the airport.
- We have more time, if you need it.
There's literally nothing left for me to shoot.
All right, let's get out of here.
The door is locked.
That's strange, I thought the guard propped it open.
I'd kick my way out, but I think these windows are bullet-proof.
We're not getting any reception in here.
Guys, it's cool.
We just gotta roll with it.
- You know, travel should be like jazz.
- Nuh-uh.
There's a lie-flat seat waiting for me, and I wanna be napping in it, with a hot towel wrapped around my big bald head!
- Help!
- All right, everybody just calm down.
I'm sure that guard will be back in, like, five minutes.
- - We're gonna miss our flight.
I should be sitting next to a semi-famous person that I can't quite place right now.
Come on, don't give up.
If we get rescued right now and there's no traffic at the airport and the van return goes smoothly and Security's super chill about all the guns we have, we could still make it.
- You guys okay up here?
- Yes!
See?
I told you not to give up hope.
It's a miracle.
- We're still gonna make it!
- Yeah, we missed our flight by a lot.
Yeah, but that's okay.
We can get the next one.
Let's see, next flight Cancelled.
Cancelled.
- Cancelled.
What is going on?
- There are huge storms in the Midwest.
- All flights are grounded.
- Oh, man.
I know this is the wrong time to bring it up, but we're standing 75 feet from where Argyle picked up John McClane at the airport.
- Take my picture with it.
- Yeah.
Okay, we can't get out until Monday afternoon, at the earliest.
I tried everything.
I begged.
I pleaded.
I even told them that Scully was a Make-a-Wish kid with a rare disease that makes him look like a giant old baby.
- Did you call it Scullyosis?
- Damn it, Rosa, that's really good and completely useless to me now.
They wouldn't even let me into a first class lounge, since my flight had already departed.
I grabbed this and ran.
You're all that's left of my dreams now, Mr. Mint.
All right, stop hugging your mint.
We have bigger problems.
Captain Holt's Commissioners interview is on Monday.
- Can't he just reschedule?
- No!
He's gonna be up against the best of the best.
The slightest slipup could cost him the job, and but whatever, you know.
It is what it is, Daddy-O.
Look, Captain Holt helped us all achieve our collective dream of going to Nakatomi Plaza.
- Only you.
- Now it's time for us to return the favor and help him achieve his.
Get him back to New York in time for that interview.
Now, we have until Monday morning, and it takes 48 hours to drive from L.A. to New York.
- We've still got time.
- No, we don't.
I checked with all the car rental agencies.
There are no available vehicles.
I'm just gonna have to call the Commissioner, cancel this meeting.
No, not on my watch.
We just have to think.
There's gotta be a way to get you back.
Got it!
May I present to you the finest RV that not much money can buy: The American Creeper.
No one should have to suffer like this for me.
Suffer?
This is a dream come true.
It's a cross-country road trip.
My dad and I took one every summer.
You blast the "Annie" soundtrack, and you eat junk food, and you bond over secrets.
I'm not telling you who I'm dating.
All right, I'll take the first shift.
American Creepers, let's get creeping!
- - Hey, one hour down.
Victory honk.
Oh, no.
Oh, boy.
Horn's stuck.
Nobody use the horn.
- - -  - What you got there, Sarge?
I microwaved a bunch of wet napkins to make a hot towel.
Just because we're in a crappy RV doesn't mean I still can't be First Class Terry.
Mmm Ah Just like the real thing.
- - Cheese puff, sir?
No, thank you.
They're full of chemicals.
Well, yes, but everything's made with chemicals, if you really think about it.
- I suppose you're right.
- I am?
- Let me try one.
- Oh.
- It imploded in my mouth.
- That's the magic of the puff.
You don't have to chew.
So, what are you gonna do when you're Commish?
I think you should focus on interagency communication and intel sharing.
Also, laser jails.
Let's not talk about things that may not happen.
Oh, I'd like to see an increase in vacation days.
And we should all get summers off like teachers.
- Let the city go to purge.
- Hey, Rosa, are you ready to go streaking?
- What?
- That's what my dad and I called getting blonde streaks in your hair.
We used to do it to our ponytails on road trips.
You just take a little lemon up top, and let the sun do the rest.
We called it giving each other road head.
You just said you called it going streaking.
It had a couple names.
Hey, speaking of names who's your new boyfriend?
Ow!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh, man, you really went to town on these cheese puffs.
Well, they're 80% air, which is something your body needs.
Dallas?
What the hell?
We were supposed to be in Louisiana by now.
We've been averaging 50 for 21 hours.
Unless Damn it!
The speedometer's broken.
No wonder everyone was flipping us off.
I thought it was just racism.
- Well, I'm sure it didn't help.
- Yeah.
I'm sorry, I don't think we can make up the time.
No, there's no way I'm letting you miss that interview.
We just have to make less stops.
Hey, guys, listen up, from now on, we use the bathroom in the RV.
- No!
- There are so many of us.
- I know, I'm sorry, but it's the only way.
- Me first!
Hey, guys, the door doesn't close all the way.
No peeking.
- - - You guys didn't hear that, did you?
- I'm still hearing it.
- I'm never gonna stop hearing it!
- Okay, new plan: we go back to the old bathroom break schedule, and we just drive at max speed.
Captain, punch it.
Punch it.
- Why are you not punching it?
- I'm not comfortable operating this vehicle at a speed greater than the prevailing road and traffic conditions.
Fine!
I'll do it myself.
This is going great.
I'm already used to the bouncing and shaking.
- I smell smoke.
- Really?
All I smell is residual Scully.
I definitely smell smoke.
- Pull over right now.
-  Well, I checked everywhere.
Nothing's on fire.
Nothing's even smoldering.
We just wasted ten minutes for no reason.
You know what, Captain, I think you're right.
I do smell smoke.
So, bottom-line this thing for me.
How long is it gonna take to fix?
- It's still on fire.
- She's gone, Jakey.
She's creeping her way to heaven.
Let's be honest, she's creeping her way back to hell.
All right, guys, we have to focus and think of a new plan for getting Holt back for his interview.
Now, all we've lost is our only mode of transportation.
And our clothes and food!
All I have left is this first class mint, and none of you get to eat him!
Well, perhaps we should just focus on finding a place to sleep tonight.
I might have a solution for that.
How far is it to Mansfurd, Texas?
- Like, half an hour.
- Great!
I have cousins there: Becca, Tommy, and Steve.
- There's a Boyle in every state.
- Texas Boyles.
I'm excited.
Do they wear bolo ties and cowboy hats?
Nope, still just beige on tan.
- Steve, Tommy, Becca!
- Becca is a man.
Oh, thank you so much for letting us stay here.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- I love you.
God, it is so nice to meet you guys!
Is this a working cattle ranch?
Oh, yes.
This is a stud farm.
We are the cow insemination kings of Central Texas.
Of course you are.
We have sleeping bags for you guys here in the great room.
If you hear what sounds like screaming, that's just cow intercourse.
-  - Now we're all sleeping in one room, - next to a cow orgy.
- I would much rather be hanging out with you.
- What are you doing, Boyle?
- Just brushing my hair.
Not you, Becca.
I was talking to Charles.
- I was just bringing you some water.
- Thanks.
Mm-hm.
So, uh, who you talking to?
Is that your mystery hunk?
Babe, are you all right?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll call you back later.
- Was that a woman's voice?
- It's my sister.
Wait she called you babe.
When my cousin called me babe, you said relatives shouldn't do that.
What's really going on?
I'm dating a woman.
- I'm bi.
- Oh That's great.
That's great, Rose.
I just want you to know that I totally support I don't wanna talk about it right now, okay?
- Just leave it alone, Boyle.
- By all means.
Not you, Becca!
Okay.
I love you.
I love you too.
Can't sleep either, huh?
- This cow screaming is so loud.
- So loud.
Is it a pleasure sound or pain?
- Maybe they're into both?
- I hear they're into leather.
- Was that a joke?
- Gallows humor.
Being in this bovine brothel is truly a nightmare.
Hey, I'm sorry that things didn't work out.
I know you always hoped that you'd be Commissioner.
No.
Over the course of my career, I've learned that it's best not to have hopes.
Sir, that is so sad.
That's like saying it's best not to have dreams.
I only have one dream a year, always on Tax Day.
In it, I must file an extension.
So, yes, it is best not to have dreams.
Well, I still wish I could've got you back in time.
Why do you care so much about this?
I don't know, it's your dream, and, you know, you changed my life, made me wanna be a better man, or whatever.
Thank you for trying.
But deep down, I always knew I'd never be Commissioner.
All my dreams start with my step-sister painting her house.
And they end with the house looking great?
No.
Sex.
-  -   Guys!
Guys!
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- Up, up, up!
Come on!
- What's going on?
Captain Holt, I know you've given up on your future, but I haven't.
- You're going to that interview.
- It's too late, Peralta.
Just put a sock in it, man!
I'm doing this because of how much I care about you, so just stay the hell out of the way!
But we're too late to drive, - and there's no available flights.
- That's what I thought, but on the way here, we passed the town of Jacksboro.
I knew I recognized it from somewhere.
Where?
Sorry, are you monologuing, - or is this a call-and-response thing?
- No, that was great.
Now, I order a lot of beef jerky online, 'cause I'm a cool guy with cool interests, and it's always shipped from Jacksboro, Texas.
There's a huge fulfillment center there.
- There is?
- Yes, Charles.
I called them, and they ship their packages - out of a regional airport.
- They do?
That's too much.
Maybe back off a little bit.
Passenger planes don't fly out of Jacksboro, but thing planes do!
- You mean cargo planes?
- Yes, thank you.
- Terry gets to interject?
- The point is, we get to fly on the back of a cargo plane to Philadelphia.
When do we have to be in Jacksboro?
In an hour and a half, so get up and get ready.
Well, we've been in these clothes since Friday.
We smell like butt.
- And all our stuff exploded.
- Right, good point.
Uh, I guess we'll just have to borrow some.
Oh, no.
From who?
No sleep till Brooklyn!
We look so cool right now.
I feel like we're in a Mervyn's commercial.
Yeah, Mervyn's!
Is this cattle trailer safe?
Who cares, it's fun.
-  - Yeah, it's terrifying, but it doesn't matter, because we're almost to the airport.
-  - What?
No, why?
Just because we're eight people standing in the back of a cattle car?
Nah, I don't care about that.
We got a tip saying there were drugs being moved in the back of a gray bovine transport unit.
Well, this is terrible.
Wait a minute, who called this tip in?
- It's impossible to say.
- They said the drugs were in the back of a bovine transport unit.
- Who calls it that?
- Everyone.
That's what they're called.
Yeah, if you're a robot, and you're the only robot I know, sir.
Bovine.
Transport.
Unit.
- Meep-morp.
Zeep.
- This is preposterous.
- What are you implying?
- Let me see your phone.
- I wanna see your call history.
- No.
- Let me see it!
- No - no!
Get away!
- Give it to me!
Guys, come on.
Break it up!
Ah-ha!
25 minutes ago, outgoing call to 911.
You sabotaged us, Mr. Robot!
Not the TV show, but the point is, you sabotaged us!
Terry, would you do the honors?
Why?
You called the pigs on us?
I don't know how this happened.
- Perhaps it was a bottom dial.
- Liar.
The reason you said you knew you'd never become Commissioner is 'cause you were making sure of it.
You've been sabotaging us from the beginning.
Oh, please.
You drove by Nakatomi Plaza on purpose, didn't you?
You knew I would see it and go insane and have to go inside, and then you trapped us in there, didn't you?
- Didn't you?
- Fine.
I did.
Over here is the elevator where McClane put the "now I have a machine gun, ho, ho, ho" down.
Take my picture with it!
And there were plenty of rental cars at the airport, weren't there?
- Hundreds.
- And you broke the speedometer.
And what else?
Did you somehow force Scully to stink up the RV - so we'd have to stop more often?
- It wasn't difficult.
Three corndogs for 99 cents?
Who could possibly eat three corndogs and has a dollar?
-  - Oh, my God.
- Did you blow up the Creeper?
- Not on purpose.
Once I realized your revolting cheese puffs were made with some extremely unstable chemicals, I deposited a few in the gas tank.
I thought they'd shut the engine down.
I didn't realize they'd ignite it.
- You really shouldn't eat those, Peralta.
- Don't tell me what to do, saboteur.
How dare you make me this upset while I'm wearing this outfit?
Look, we've been busting our asses the whole weekend to try and get you back to New York in time, and for what?
Is it all just a lie?
Is there even a Commissioners meeting.
Are you even Captain Holt?
- Do you even have a dog named Cheddar?
- There's a Commissioners meeting, and I do have a dog named Cheddar.
Then why'd you do it?
I'm compromised.
I made a decision a while ago, and now some people are holding it over my head.
I'm afraid of what they'll ask me to do if I become Commissioner.
You're compromised?
How did this happen, Mr. Prevailing Traffic and Road Conditions?
It doesn't matter.
Seamus Murphy.
- What?
- Seamus Murphy, the gangster.
He offered me info that would get you and Rosa out of prison, in exchange for a favor.
And Holt told me to turn it down, because he said it was too risky.
But you didn't turn it down, did you, Captain?
No, I did not.
- Wait - So you risked everything to get me and Rosa out of prison?
Oh, my God.
You did all of this for us?
I love you, Da aptain Daptain.
It's the cool new way of saying Captain.
It's from the world of hip-hop.
Love you.
Sir, why didn't you tell us?
I didn't want any of you entangled in this.
This is my decision, and it's also my responsibility.
Sir, with all due respect, the first thing that you taught me when you came to the Nine-Nine is that we're a team, so your responsibility is my responsibility too.
- And mine.
- And mine.
- And mine.
- And mine.
And mine.
Six people seems like a lot.
I mean, at some point, it's just too many cooks.
- And mine.
- You're gonna take that meeting, you're gonna get the job, and you're gonna become Commissioner, and we'll all figure out what to do about Murphy.
I'm touched But it's moved.
We've missed the cargo plane.
And now there's no way to get back in time - for me to make my meeting.
- Nuh-uh.
- Amy?
- What up, bro?
I need you to climb back on that strungness ladder, and I need you to climb pretty high.
- How high?
- Remember that time we went to the deli for cold cuts, and the ticket machine was broken, so you found out what time everyone arrived and made them get in a single-file line - from earliest to latest?
- Yeah.
Higher.
Copy that.
You might wanna stand back for this, sir.
- It can get pretty intense.
-  All right, you mooks, our union health plan has 100% reimbursement for out-of-state ambulance rides.
Scully will fake a medical emergency.
Don't need to fake it.
Always having at least one.
Great.
You call an ambulance, and have it take us here to Monroe, Louisiana.
The ambulance can drive 25 miles over the posted speed limit, so we'll get there by 9:00 p.m. There's a small airport there, mostly servicing crop dusters.
Of course, they can't take passengers, but thanks to a loophole in H.R. 377551, police officers are allowed to commandeer any plane in the interest of national security.
The crop duster will land at an airstrip outside of Finksburg, Maryland.
We'll take a cab to Baltimore, jump on the 6:48 a.m. train to New York, arriving at 9:26.
Kevin will meet us at Penn Station with a fresh Captain's uniform.
From there, it's a 29-minute cab ride to One Police Plaza.
You change on the way, and we should get to your meeting with five minutes to spare.
Stop clapping, you idiots!
We gotta move, move, move!
I love her.
No sleep till Brooklyn!
- - No sleep till Brooklyn!
Yes!
We did it!
- I can't believe we did it!
-  Peralta, thank you for not quitting on me.
Of course, sir.
Go get 'em.
Wait, wait!
Just one more thing.
Your first class mint?
I know how important this is to you.
You know what really makes a trip first class?
It's not the extra leg room - or the complimentary drinks - Actually, Terry, we don't really have time for a speech right now.
Fine, your breath sucks!
Just pop it and go!
It's good to be home.
Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh!
- Drink this instead.
- A mimosa!
Made with First Class Champagne.
That's the brand name.
It's from Arkansas.
I hope it's good.
- Hell yeah!
- Really?
No, it's terrible, but I really appreciate the thought.
-  - Oh, I'll take it.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, I didn't say anything about being bi, because I didn't think it was anybody's business.
And I also didn't want anything to change.
I get it.
I'm sorry I was so nosy.
It actually felt really good to tell somebody on the squad, finally.
- I'm glad it was you.
- All right.
Also, now we go back to never talking about my love life again.
Uh, request denied.
Is her name Anne?
Meredith?
Kim?
- Erica?
Moana?
- Captain Holt!
It's official.
My hat is in the ring for Commissioner.
I still don't know how we're gonna deal with the - Murphy complication.
- Two words: laser jails.
- But, you know, we'll figure it out.
- Nine-Nine!
Nine-Nine!
- Not a doctor.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 And so concludes this year's Secret Santa drawing.
Just a quick reminder of the rules: $40 limit, no perishable items, and no homemade massage coupons, Hitchcock.
Fine, then everyone'll have to pay full price for them.
Oh, Captain.
I would like a $40 gift card to any restaurant that serves nachos.
- I don't have you, Peralta.
- Not only do I know that you do indeed have me, but I also know - who everyone else has.
- That's not possible.
Perhaps not for an ordinary man such as yourself, Jeffords.
But for the brilliant mind of Detective Sherlock Peralta I legally changed my name it's quite simply elementary.
For, you see, Amy made a face I only recognized from our bedroom, which means that she has Captain Holt.
Charles has Terry.
His eyes keep - shifting over to him.
- No, I don't.
Terry looked disgusted, which means he has Hitchcock.
Rosa didn't draw a name, nor did she put one in.
- She doesn't wanna participate.
- Never do.
Hitchcock moves his mouth when he reads and he quite clearly said Charles.
- I did get Charles.
- Scully has Amy.
He's hold his paper name-side out.
- Oh, he's good.
- And I have Scully, which means Captain Holt has me.
I'll be taking that gift card.
Daddy loves nachos.
Should we draw the names again and leave Jake out?
Yeah!
No!
Sherlock wants a present!
Okay, quick update on the Warren Street break-in.
Security cameras caught a picture of the suspect and guess what?
That's right.
We got a hot perp alert.
-  -  Ooh!
- That's a handsome man.
- Mm, I'd like to - bring that guy to justice.
- We all would.
But unfortunately, police cornered him and he shot himself in the face.
-  - All right.
Thank you for that shockingly dark update.
- Anything else?
- Uh, yes.
Something I'd like to say.
I'm a pretty private person so this is kinda hard for me, but here we go.
I'm bi-sexual.
All right.
I will now field one minute and zero seconds of questions pertaining to this.
- Go.
Amy.
- How long have you known?
Since seventh grade.
I was watching "Saved by the Bell" and I thought, Zack Morris is hot.
And then I thought Lisa Turtle, also hot.
The fact that the words Kelly and Kapowski didn't just come out of your mouth is lunacy.
What made you decided to tell us now?
Charles found out on the road trip and I was positive he was not gonna be able to keep the secret for much longer.
Bye Rosa.
I mean, not "bi," but bye!
I mean, see ya!
I mean, have fun only having sex with men.
Just bangin' dudes, left and right.
I just stopped saying bye all together.
So are you seeing anyone now?
- Yeah.
Her name's Tiffany.
- Are you lying about her name - so we won't look her up?
- Yes, I am.
Next.
- Do you know Anne Heche?
- I do.
- Ohh.
- I must say, this is going considerably better than when I came out to my colleagues.
They were not, as the kids say, awake.
- Do you mean woke?
- I did mean woke.
But it's grammatically incoherent.
Okay, we have time for one more question.
- Oh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
- Nope.
Absolutely not.
We're done.
Smart.
It was not tasteful.
Is anyone else having trouble with the Internet?
I've been trying to file a warrant request for 45 minutes and the stupid server keeps timing out.
Nothing's loading.
It's all pinwheels.
This all started when Cyber Crimes moved in downstairs.
I bet those jerks are hogging our bandwidth.
Man, I miss the Sex Crimes Unit.
I know!
They were so fun.
Remember their Christmas Party?
-  - Okay, Sergeant Jeffords and I will talk to Cyber.
Tell them I can't get on WebMD.
My nipple tripled in size and I wanna know - if it's good or bad.
- Can't believe that's good.
Hey.
Was that weird earlier?
You mean when Charles showed us those pictures of Nikolaj taking a very sudsless bath?
Yes, it was uncomfortable.
No, I mean when I told everyone I was bi.
- Was it too touchy-feely?
- Rosa, no.
It was great.
And don't worry, just because you opened up a little bit doesn't mean everyone's gonna be less afraid of you.
- We're all still terrified.
- Thanks, Jake.
- So how'd your parents take it?
- Uhh - I haven't told 'em yet.
- Really?
I mean, of course, you don't have to but I just thought you guys were getting closer since prison.
No, I mean, we are.
It's just, I don't know how I would say something like that.
Especially to my dad.
He's super traditional.
I'm afraid this would just mess everything up.
We've been having so much fun lately.
- I don't wanna lose that.
- Okay.
Maybe just be honest with them.
Right?
Tell 'em how you feel.
Like, you could say, Mom, Dad, I'm bisexual.
But I'm still your daughter.
I'm still the same person that I've always been.
And who I love will never change that.
And you guys raised me to be strong and confident.
And I don't wanna hide who I am anymore.
I am bi.
Damn.
That was And I know that this may come as a shock to you, but it's my truth.
So I hope you can accept that.
- Jake - Maybe you still see me as your little girl, but I'm woman now.
And I know my own heart.
- You done?
- Yeah.
Wow, that felt amazing.
I really disappeared into it.
- Should I become an actor?
- Absolutely not.
- Copy that.
All right.
Good luck.
- Thanks.
-  - Look, that guy's watching a video.
No buffering.
They got all the bars, Captain.
All the bars!
Keep it together, Jeffords.
Oh.
You must be Raymond Holt.
Whoa.
No.
Germs.
We just wanted to ask about the Internet.
Ever since you guys arrived, things have gotten - slow for us upstairs.
- We're the Cyber Crimes Unit.
Kinda need the bandwidth.
Do you guys even use the Internet upstairs?
I thought you just write down your hunches in your notebooks with your pens and paper.
I'll have you know you're speaking to your Captain.
Well, I'll have you know that we don't report to you.
We report to the Commissioner's office.
Ever heard of them?
I don't care who you report to, this is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna, um - put the wires - Right.
Um - Terry.
- Uh into the things.
And and beef up the speeds.
Got it?
We want beefy speeds!
Long story short, we remain un-beefed.
Unfortunately, we're out of options.
- They're just not scared of us.
- Right.
But there is one person who scares everyone.
Hey!
Captain Holt, Terry, Charles, I wanna say Alan?
Close.
It's Amy.
This is nice.
I can't believe - you're buying me dinner.
- Oh, well, you really - helped me today.
- Did I?
I felt like I sorta straight-splained how to come out to you.
No, it was good practice.
I think I'm ready to tell my parents.
That's awesome.
When are you gonna do it?
- In five minutes.
- What?
Actually, scratch that, they're here.
This is happening and I need you to be here with me and also just step in and do it for me.
Rosa, I think that's a very bad idea.
And frankly, I'm not very comfortable Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Diaz!
America's favorite couple!
I didn't know Jake was joining us.
Neither did I. What a fun surprise that none of us were remotely prepared for, Rosa, right?
- You seem nervous.
Why?
- Uhh global warming.
What a bitch, right?
We all gon' drown.
Anyways, I'm gonna head to the bathroom for the duration of one conversation.
No!
Uh, guys, I have something I need to tell you.
- What is it, honey?
- Uhh, Jake, you take it.
Seriously?
Me?
Oh, man, now I really do have to go to the bathroom.
What, you didn't before?
You lied?
You know, Oscar, most people just ignore my nervous rambling.
Maybe shift focus back to Rosa.
Don't worry.
- We know what's happening.
- You do?
Of course.
You and Jake are dating.
That's why you were nervous.
'Cause you know I never liked him.
What?
Okay, first of all, that's insane.
We've only met once and we totally hit it off.
We talked about soccer, I called it fÃºtbol.
Oh, I see what happened.
But secondly, - Rosa and I are not - Denying that we're dating.
Uh, you're right.
We're a couple.
I love you, honey bun.
Uhh!
We need your help, Gina.
Gina, ugh, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
- It's on your jacket.
- I know, but no one says it out loud and my baby can't read.
Which, I'm told is normal for a ten-week-old, so - How's little Enigma doing?
- We call her Iggy now, but you're gonna wanna keep it down because she's trying to take a nap, okay, Amy?
Oh, sure, I just feel like I was matching the same volume - that you were speaking at.
- Amy, keep it down.
Yes, yes, babies are adorable.
They're like we are but so much smaller.
So we're here because we're having an issue with the new Cyber Unit that has moved into the second floor.
What happened to Sex Crimes?
They were so nice.
Remember their Christmas party?
- Oh, so good.
-  - Ohh.
- But now Cyber's hogging our Internet and we can't get them to stop.
But you can intimidate anyone into doing what you want.
No, sorry, I can't.
That's precinct business and, well, I've left that life behind.
But your maternity leave is over in two weeks.
Amy, volume, okay?
Volume!
Hey, wait up.
Why'd you leave the table?
If we go to the bathroom at the same time, they're gonna think we're hooking up since apparently we're dating now.
I'm sorry I said that.
I thought I was ready to do this, but I am not.
- I'm not gonna do it tonight, okay?
- Yes, of course.
Look, I support you no matter what.
Just do whatever feels right.
Can we just pretend to be a couple for tonight?
And then I'll tell them in a few weeks that we broke up.
Fine.
But I have one rule.
- Hands off my butt.
- That's not gonna - be a problem.
- Well, you say that now but you're about to enter the Jake Peralta boyfriend experience.
It can be quite intoxicating.
Hm.
Also, you sat on a meatball.
Did I?
Oh, man, these are my Friday jeans.
Anyways, I'm gonna snap off a wiz and I'll meet you back at the table.
Let's do this.
Guys, without Gina, we'll never be able to bend Cyber to our will.
So we need to change tactics.
We need to woo them with the international language of friendship.
- Pork.
- Ohh.
Ooh!
I'll take it to them.
It's all dudes down there and I'm not above using a little flirtation to get what I want.
- Was that a wink?
- You tell me.
I honestly don't know, but you're all we got.
Hello, boys.
Oh, wait, wait I winked my contact out.
No, no, no.
It's still there.
- Oh, God it's behind my eye!
- Fall back, Amy.
- Ohh - I got it, I got it.
Look, we got off on the wrong foot this morning.
And I was hoping we could start fresh.
So we got you this.
Mmm.
Decent.
Great, now that you've accepted our meat pile, perhaps you'll help us restore our internet.
Sure.
I can definitely help with that.
- Mm.
- How many KBPSs are you looking for?
- Many.
- Yeah, that's not an answer.
I need an exact number.
- 100.
-  Too few?
Too many?
- Four.
- Okay, bro, I'll give you four kilobytes of Internet.
You're making a fool of yourself.
-  - No!
You're the fool!
-  - Hey, little man.
- Why so teeny?
- I'm not teeny.
- I'm average size.
-  What a sad brag.
I don't even know who you are.
But I know who you are, Devin.
You tell everyone you got a degree from Stanford but you really went to Stamforb, an online college based in Arkansas.
-  - It's a good school.
You live with your aunt.
That's sad.
And you spend a third of your salary on tropical fish and aquaria.
You know, I found all this off of, hm, 20 minutes of idle snoopin' around.
Imagine what I could do with a dedicated couple of hours.
- What do you want?
- I want you to give the Internet back to my friends.
Mm-kay?
Or I'll keep diggin' and diggin' and diggin' and diggin'.
Fine!
I'll give you back your Internet, okay?
- Just we're through.
- Oh!
And maybe your co-workers would like to know what happened on your 7th grade field trip to D.C. - You monster.
- He pooped in the Reflecting Pool.
So how did you two finally get together after all these years?
Oh, uh, you know, I've just been crazy about her forever and then one day I picked up my battered old guitar and I sang her a song.
Ohh!
- How did it go?
- Oh, you don't wanna hear it.
- Yeah.
- Yes, I do!
Well, I don't have my guitar here.
- Sing the song.
- Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Rosa, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz Diaz, Diaz, Diaz, Diaz Rosa Diaz, Rosa Diaz Diaz Rosa, Riza Diaz Diaz, you are so cool Sounds better with a guitar.
-  - Oh!
- Just put that away.
- What was that in the picture?
- Just my mom.
- Kinda looked like - your co-worker Amy.
- Jake and Amy are friends.
- It's not weird.
- He had his arm around her and she was showing off a ring.
Wow, you got a really good look at that picture, huh?
What's going on?
Jake and Amy are engaged.
- That's okay.
- What?
We understand.
Love is complicated.
Wait, why would you be okay with that?
Mijita, when you called this dinner, you were so nervous, we were worried you were gonna tell us you were gay.
So you would rather me be some dude's mistress than be in a loving relationship with a woman?
Well, Jake and I aren't dating.
But guess what?
Your worst fears are real.
I'm not straight.
I'm bisexual.
And I don't care what you think about it.
Screw this.
I'm outta here.
I'm also gonna go.
Are you guys on Venmo?
You know what?
We'll figure it out later.
This isn't the right time.
All right.
Hey, so, I ran after you last night, - but I lost you in the subway.
- I took a cab home.
Really?
Well, then, I definitely terrified some random lady.
Hey, look, I'm sorry things didn't go how you wanted with your parents.
- It was fine.
- Rosa, you don't - have to say that.
- No, it really did go fine.
They texted me last night.
"Don't worry about dinner.
See you at game night".
Nice.
But very surprising.
It's great.
I told them I'm bi, and they still invited me to game night.
They're clearly okay with it.
Well, I'm just glad it worked out.
- Enjoy game night.
- Actually, they want you to come to make up for - how awkward dinner was.
- Oh, fantastic.
I'm still involved.
Well, I'm sure your dad is a super chill guy - to play against.
-  He is not.
Well, then, let's hope I'm on his team.
- That is worse.
- Cool.
So no good options.
Super stoked about this invite.
- Here we go.
-  It's loading!
We got Internet!
All right, I guess my work here is done, guys, How can we ever thank you?
I'll tell you how.
Use this precious Internet.
Use it every day.
Keep multiple tabs open, stream videos in HD, leave comments on everything you can find.
Most importantly, make your avatars GIFs.
I was thinking more like a pizza party when you come back in two weeks.
Oh, yeah.
So here's the thing: - I'm not coming back.
- What?
- Seriously?
- Yeah, listen, I have a daughter now and when she grows up I wanna be doing something that makes her proud.
So I'm starting my own company.
- Ooh!
What is it?
- I'm running a sports league for other people's pets.
- Ohh.
- Well, Gina, as your colleague, best friend, brother and ex-lover - Ugh.
- I fully support your dreams, but do you really wanna leave?
My mind is made up.
And so this is Gina Linetti's last grand exit from the Nine-Nine.
I will remember you Where's that coming from?
- She's gone.
- Do you think that's the last time we'll ever see her?
Bye, Gina.
I don't know what that is.
That could literally be anything.
Maybe try guessing.
Rule violation!
You're not supposed to speak.
There's our turn, once again.
Oh, well, do you want me to tell you what I was drawing just for fun?
We're not playing just for fun.
Mm-kay, well, don't let my desire to have fun ruin what seems to be a very nice night so far.
- Right, Rosa?
- Yeah, right.
So your mother and I talked about what you told us last night.
We don't need to talk about that right now.
We want you to know we're not upset.
Great.
I'm not upset either.
Because no matter what you call yourself, you still like men.
So you can still get married - and have a child.
- I can do those things with either a man or a woman.
Yes, but it will be a man because this is just a phase.
Okay, that's settled.
Ladies up.
So, since you're not coming back, we wanted to bring you all your stuff.
It's a lot of gum and what seem to be blackmail files you've been keeping on all of us?
I'm not a blackmailer.
If you tell anyone I am, I will release your secrets.
Look, we know you want your daughter to be proud of the work that you do.
I just hope you know how important you've been to the Nine-Nine.
Yeah, just today, I was able to pull a warrant and arrest the guy I've been tracking for three months because you got the internet back.
You're indispensible and we're really gonna miss you.
And I loved the Nine-Nine, you guys.
It just feels like it's time for me to, like, build something of my own.
Like my entrepreneurial idols, Oprah Winfrey, Lex Luthor The Superman villain?
He built an empire, didn't he?
- Yeah.
- Well, we wish you luck.
And it's not gonna be the same without you.
Mm, thanks for saying that, and I don't know, uh You know what?
You can have your blackmail files back.
I don't want 'em anymore.
Gina, these are just photos of me - in my everyday clothes.
-  - I know.
It's painful, right?
- All right.
- Your turn, mija.
- Right.
Uhh, a woman.
Uhh, uh, lady.
Uhh, women.
Two women.
Holding hands, uh, friends.
Ohh, mm, uhh sisters!
Ooh!
Business partners.
Uh, um, ooh, oh, oh, co-owners of a chocolate shop!
Oh, love.
Love what do women love?
The George Clooney!
It's a wedding!
They're brides.
They're in love.
Mom, Dad, I know you don't wanna talk about this but I do.
I might get married to a man like you so clearly want and I might not.
'Cause this is not a phase.
And I need you to understand that.
- I'm bisexual.
- There's no such thing as being bisexual.
Yes, there is.
I know there is because that's who I am.
I'm attracted to both men and women.
I've known this about myself for a really long time, and I didn't wanna tell you because I was afraid you were gonna react exactly like you are.
What do you want us to say?
That you accept me for who I am.
Wow.
Okay, let's go.
Hey.
Got you coffee.
I don't drink coffee.
Just herbal tea.
Oh.
That's cool.
It only cost me, like, 18 bucks.
Brooklyn is a nightmare.
Hey, man, thanks for being there last night.
Of course.
Sorry again about how it all went down.
Well, I'm glad I opened up to them, even if it didn't change their minds.
I finally said what I wanted to say.
- It felt right.
- Yeah.
Still sucks, though.
Still sucks.
That's weird.
My dad's here.
Hey, do you mind staying out here - with me to talk to him?
- Um, yes, of course.
- Whatever you need.
-  Your face.
No, man, you've done enough.
- Get out of here.
- Oh, thank God.
Good luck.
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
I reacted poorly last night.
- This is all new to me.
- I know.
But it's also not new, you know.
I'm still the same person I always was.
Well, I don't feel I know that person.
- Dad - My fault, not yours.
I want you to be able to tell me everything.
I can't promise you I'll understand.
But I'm trying.
I want you to know that I accept you for who you are.
And I love you very, very much.
I love you, too.
So have you been on any dates with women, yet?
Dad, we didn't talk about my dating life before, we don't need to talk about it now.
Yeah, good, good.
You're right.
So where's Mom?
Mm Mom needs a little more time.
Oof.
I guess family game night's gonna be kinda weird.
You know what, mijita, maybe we better put game night on hold for a little while.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna let you get back to work, okay?
I expect certain things from my assistant.
Black ink only.
No blue.
I'm not a street artist.
Also, if you must knock on my door, limit yourself to two raps.
If I wanted to hear inane pounding, - I could go see "Stomp".
- He could go see "Stomp".
- Gina.
- Who's this noob?
We had to hire someone to replace you, Gina, - because you quit.
- Well, fire him.
'Cause I'm back, baby!
- Really?
- What changed your mind?
Was is the speech that Charles and I gave you?
No.
Captain Holt said he'd give me a 5% raise if I came back and he's letting me sit at my desk and work on my side business one day a week.
We never had that conversation.
We just did, baby.
See ya, man bangs.
Come, Brent, let's get you down to HR before that start paperwork goes through.
- Welcome back, Linetti.
- Thanks, man.
Ugh!
All right, look, Gina, come on.
It's just us now.
Admit it.
Amy and I changed your mind.
All right, it was you guys.
I actually even cried a little bit after you left my apartment.
- Aw.
- Oh!
I made Gina Linetti cry?
Hey, calm down.
I had a baby ten weeks ago.
I cried to a carpet cleaner commercial yesterday.
Gina!
Welcome back.
It's great to see you.
Hey, what's everybody - doing tonight?
- Nothin'.
Why?
There's something we all need to do.
- What's going on?
- Family game night!
Don't worry, I brought "Twister".
- Hey.
- Hey, Rosa.
- Hey, Rosa.
Beer.
- Here goes the snacks.
Ehh, you know, in another lifetime, you and I would've made a hot ass couple.
Agreed.
Diaz, you should be very proud of yourself.
I know things aren't exactly where you wanna be right now, but, uh, I promise you they will improve.
- Thank you, Captain.
- Every time someone steps up and says who they are, the world becomes a better, more interesting place.
So thank you.
Hey, do you seriously only have two wine glasses?
- Yeah.
I live alone.
- Well, you're gonna need to get some more, 'cause there's a lot of us here.
Thank you for doing this, man.
Of course.
We'll be here every week.
Rosa, I broke both your wine glasses and your fridge door and your bathroom.
Every single week!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Thank you, Margaret.
You're welcome, Raymond.
- Seamus Murphy.
- That's right.
Remember how I saved your detectives from prison in exchange for a favor?
- The time has come - Wait.
- This isn't my order.
- What?
This is an omelet.
I only eat omelets on vacation.
Yeah, I don't care what you eat.
I'm here to call in the favor that you owe me.
Really?
What if I say no?
This is you asking me for intel and promising to pay me back.
How do you think this would look to your bosses, especially now that you're up for the commissioner job?
Yeah.
I know everything.
So what do you want from me?
A permit to throw a block party?
We don't even have to break the law.
This is fantastic news.
I am not giving Seamus Murphy that permit.
He only wants to use the block party as a cover for something criminal: a robbery, a murder, or something worse.
You don't know that for sure, and that's your loophole.
- I don't believe in loopholes.
- What?
Loopholes are the best.
Remember that time when Pancake Palace had that all-you-can-eat deal, but they didn't set a time limit?
I ate pancakes for a week for $3.99.
All I had to do was sleep there and never shower.
What?
Thanks for the invite, friend.
I will not be using a loophole, Peralta.
As always, I'll be using the main hole or no hole.
I choose no hole.
You just said "hole" way too much, sir.
And that's coming from Charles.
Yes, that's concerning.
Ugh, you think you know someone, Jake.
Unbelievable!
Captain, we think we found a way for you to do Murphy the favor and still live with yourself.
Sounds like a loophole.
Nope, we found the main hole, and it is open for business.
- Oh, gross.
- Yep, sorry.
Look.
You don't want to give Murphy the permit because you're afraid he's gonna use it as a cover for something illegal, but what if we figured out what he was up to and could stop him before he did it?
That way you could give him a permit with a clean conscience.
Well, how are you gonna find out what his real plan is?
He's smart, and he doesn't talk to anyone but his family.
I was worried about that, too, but that's when I remembered: "The Godfather".
The Diane Keaton movie.
No one refers to it as that, but Charles is right, she is in it.
This isn't one of your movie plans, is it?
First of all, if we had developed a "Minority Report" style pre-crime division like I suggested, we wouldn't be in this Seamus mess, and it's not just because I wanted to go like this, although I did.
But secondly, in "The Godfather," Don Corleone had three sons: Michael, his favorite - Diane Keaton's husband.
- Mm-kay.
Then there was Sonny, the hothead.
Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.
Charles, you're being distracting.
No, he's not, he's actually helping me to follow this.
Continue going through Diane Keaton's relatives.
Fine, Diane Keaton's other brother-in-law is Fredo, the screw-up, the weak link.
And you think the Murphys have a Fredo?
Every family does, and in this family, his name is Kyle.
- Is he on a roller coaster?
- Yes.
It's his driver's license photo somehow.
He's never had a job, he took six years to graduate high school, and his father paid $200,000 so he could attend the University of Arizona.
Lake Havasu campus.
-  - Sir, this kid is a disaster.
If there's anyone that's gonna give us info on the Murphy family and slip up, it's Kyle.
Okay, but if you don't figure out what his plan is, I don't give him that permit.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
All right, go make contact with Diane Keaton's brother-in-law.
Fredo.
It's Fredo.
It's one of the most popular movies of all time.
Won best picture, so.
Ready for a kick-ass assignment?
Hell yeah.
Let's do this.
Wait, what do you mean by "kick-ass"?
Holt wants us to get that block party permit.
Damn it.
I guess I'll take the knife out of my pants.
No, come on, Rosa.
It'll be so cool.
We get to go to SAPO, the Street Activity Permit Office.
It is the oldest continuously operating permit office in the state.
Pass.
Find somebody else.
But we promised to help Captain Holt.
Look, it'll be quick.
We'll just go, get Murphy his permit, and maybe grab a few shots for the 'Gram.
They have the original permits for the 1939 World's Fair.
- No.
- Yes!
- No.
-  Yes!
No, I mean, "No, I don't want to do this".
No, yeah, come on.
We're gonna do it.
Hey, Gina.
How's it feel to be back?
- Any trouble adjusting?
- Adjusting to what?
To life as a working mom.
You have to juggle the baby, the job, your new business.
Terry, juggling isn't hard.
That's why the salary for jugglers is so low.
Name one rich juggler.
Doesn't Dave Coulier juggle?
If you're reaching for Coulier, then you've already lost the argument, Terr-Bear.
But there is one thing: I need a private place where I can pump.
I was thinking maybe I could take this whole floor and you guys could move down to that place where we park.
The garage?
Sure, if you think that works.
Well, there's an empty office behind records.
It's nice and quiet.
We can put in a comfy chair, maybe a mini fridge.
Uh, that would be a no-go, Sarge.
- That's our nap room.
- She needs to pump.
- The room is hers.
- Whoa.
That escalated fast.
Okay.
There's our Fredo.
He comes in here every day at noon, for some reason.
Hey, change the channel, dude.
"Finding Bigfoot" is starting.
All right, let's go over our covers one more time.
We are small-time operators that just moved here from Miami.
We piloted go-fast boats, moving contraband to Cuba.
Where we slept with the same prostitute.
- No.
- And she said you were - the best she ever had.
- Maybe.
And I should watch you to learn.
Back to no let's just not talk about our sex lives.
All right, we've got a week, so we can ease our way into this thing.
Let's not blow it by engaging right away.
Oh, no.
We made eye contact.
He's coming over here.
We're engaging right away.
Hey, what's going on?
I saw you guys staring at me.
What?
No, no, no, no, no.
We were just looking at the TV behind you.
We love "Finding Bigfoot".
- It's our favorite show.
- Yeah.
I mean, why haven't they caught him yet, right?
Totally.
I mean, he's so big.
You'd think it'd be easy.
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Oh, my God, I'm feeling a real connection here.
Should we hang out sometime, or am I being crazy?
You're not being crazy, Kyle.
How do you know my name?
Because we're so connected.
Oh!
- Yes!
- What?
So, this is my pad.
TV room, recording studio where I lay down my raps.
And this is where the magic happens.
It's where I practice doing magic.
Oh, so literally, then.
- Love all the lamps.
- Thanks.
I accidentally ordered 100 lamps instead of one.
They only give you, like, a six-month return window, so.
- You get it.
- Totally.
Man, this place is huge.
How do you afford it?
Do you have, like, a great job or family money?
Yeah, lots of it, I'm part of the Murphy crime family.
-  Oh.
- Aw, damn it.
I am not supposed to say that.
We're not a crime family, okay?
- We're a cream family.
- Dude, it's fine.
Honestly, we're also involved in cream.
- Organized cream.
- Cool, cool.
Hey, just checking you guys mean crime, right?
- Yes.
- Okay, good, right, go on.
Well, we're actually looking for some work right now.
We just got into town from Miami.
Where we didn't sleep with the same prostitute.
Yes, anyways, do you think your family needs any help?
- Any big jobs coming up?
- Uh, wouldn't know.
They don't tell me anything.
They're mad at me.
What?
Why?
I used to drive for my uncle Seamus.
One day, he had this big cream meeting We don't have to keep doing that.
Okay, cool.
He was torturing some guy.
Anyway, I was waiting in his favorite car, a white 1980 Rolls-Royce, but he was taking forever, so I decided to go catch a matinee of "Suicide Squad".
And he was pissed that you drove off in the car?
No, obviously I left the Rolls there with the keys in the ignition in case he needed it, but guess what happened?
-  It got stolen.
- Oh, my God.
- How'd you guys know?
- We're just connected, Kyle.
-  Team Bigfoot.
-  Team Bigfoot!
Anyway, they kicked me out of the family business for good.
Apparently, I'm a "liability" and "worthless" and "Kyle".
The last one is just my name, but you should hear their tone.
So, you don't know about anything that's going down at all?
No, but if you know anyone who's looking to buy a lamp for really cheap, I know a guy.
- Oh, Kyle.
- Yeah, that's it.
That's how they say it.
This is taking forever.
Can't you just forge the signatures?
I'm a notary, Rosa.
You can't say stuff like that around me.
I could lose my stamp over that.
I've never met anyone who cares so much about stupid bureaucracy.
Bureaucracy is not stupid.
It's elegant.
It's a beautiful puzzle waiting to be cracked.
Every rule, every form has its purpose.
It all fits together, and when the puzzle is solved and you take a step back and see the big picture, it's like staring into the face of God.
Hey.
- We moved up a spot.
- Oh.
You seem like a real nerd.
Hello, Muriel.
Another day in paradise?
She actually means that.
Please don't be offended.
Great.
What do you want?
To apply for a block party permit.
Here is form 1290.
Oh, wait, you trying to get a permit for this Friday?
You would need 1290-B expedited request and a 1021-J adjustment waiver and a sweet, sweet P-28-P supplemental.
Right.
There's just one problem.
What?
No.
I did absolutely everything.
The 1021-J has to be submitted with an approved 1290.
But I'm submitting the 1021-J to get the 1290 approved.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- I guess it doesn't.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
This is just a puzzle, and I can figure it out.
To get an approved 1290, I need an approved 1021-J, which I can't get without an approved 1290, which I can't get without an approved 1021-J, which I can't get without an approved 1290, which I can't get without an approved 1021-J, which I can't get without an approved 1290, which I can't get without an approved 1021-J Okay.
She's in a loop.
You broke her brain.
I'm gonna take her out of here.
Which I can't get without an approved 1290, which I can't get without Sarge, Hitchcock and I just uncovered something huge.
- You solved a crime?
- What?
That's insane, no.
It's about our nap room.
Guess how long Gina's been pumping for?
- I don't want to - The last hour.
Now, everyone knows Gina's using a Nodella Harmony Breastpump with 2-Phase Expression Technology for faster milk expression.
You shouldn't know so much about breastpumps, Hitchcock.
Well, you should know more about what's going on in your precinct.
Given the Nodella's exceptional flow, there's no way she needs to be pumping more than 20 minutes a side.
Wow, you didn't even say "breast".
Yeah, because I'm not a child.
I need my afternoon nap.
Okay, what are you guys trying to say?
Come with us.
Where's Gina?
She just left the pump running and disappeared.
- You got played so hard.
- You cuck.
So, did you make contact with Murphy's weak link?
- Diane Keaton's brother-in-law?
- Yes.
We're real tight, but unfortunately, he's such a weak link, his family won't tell him anything.
So that's it, then.
We have no idea what Murphy's really up to?
I can't morally give him that permit, so it's over.
Wait.
We still have time.
Maybe there's a way to get Kyle back in with his family.
Like, what if Ooh, Jake's wheels are turning.
Your brain baby is crowning.
Boyle, please.
That's disgusting.
No, it's helping.
I am having a brain baby.
- Then push, man, push.
- Breathe.
You can do this.
- You are so strong.
- Ah, got it!
Kyle's uncle cut him off because of that stolen car, right, but what if we could find that car and have Kyle give it back to him?
Then all is forgiven.
Kyle's back in the family.
Right, but how do we find that car?
We just did a big sweep of Brooklyn chop shops.
Maybe Seamus's car is one of them.
Maybe it's in the impound lot.
Yes.
Okay.
Put in my password.
Yes, it's in the impound lot!
My brain baby's a genius.
It's a miracle.
Who's this lady we're meeting?
The source: Florence Tinj.
She ran the rules and regs department for 30 years.
She wrote the forms.
She has touched every life in this city.
- Not mine.
- Yeah-huh.
Haven't you ever filled out a mileage reimbursement form?
No, dude, I make you do those for me.
Right, I'm so grateful to you for that.
Anyway, she's the only person that can figure this out.
She understands the bureaucracy on a level that we mortals can't even fathom.
Florence Tinj.
What?
Detectives Diaz and Santiago, NYPD, and I just want to say  Those cats are having sex.
Yeah.
Uh, can you explain these forms to us?
They seem logically flawed.
At first, I thought it was a mistake, but then I thought, "There's something deeper at play here".
No, it's a mistake.
- They don't work.
- What?
But you wouldn't design a form that literally can't be filed.
Yeah, I would.
I did it all the time, mostly out of spite, but also incompetence.
Plus, I just found out I'm dyslexic.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
Good luck with all your, uh, hoarding, Florence.
Okay.
We're supposed to pick up Kyle in a minute.
We can't just bring him straight to his uncle's Rolls, or it'll seem suspicious, so we gotta figure out a way to make him notice it on his own.
What if you drive by and I yell, "Those two birds are having sex"!
He'll obviously want to see that, and when he looks, voilÃ .
The car's right there.
Or I could just drive by it very slowly.
- Ah, also a good plan.
- Okay, let's do it.
So, that's when it hits me: savory dinner cereal.
-  Oh, my God.
- What?
Instead of it being cold, what if I heat it up?
Unless is that just soup?
-  It is.
- You know what?
I think I left my wallet at home.
- I'm just gonna turn around.
- Dude, look.
My favorite gamer just uploaded a new vid, and his mom is in this one.
Then Tom Cruise hang glides in with a machine gun and he's like, "This is my party now"!
Anyway, if I could make a movie, that's how it would start.
Kyle, look, two birds are having sex!
What?
Where?
Aw, man, I missed it.
Well, let's just turn around again.
Where are those birds?
Still no humping birds.
Damn it.
We're never gonna see those birds.
Look behind that 1980 white Rolls Royce.
Ugh, I wish that stupid car would move.
Kyle, isn't that your uncle's car?
Oh, my God.
Dude!
I did it.
I found it.
I found my uncle's car.
Victory dance, whoo!
Oh, no, wait, stop!
Don't dance in the - Oh, Fredo.
- I think I got hit!
Ok, why are you barefoot?
I'm violating uniform conduct code 773 because the rules are pointless because they were written by a hoarder who doesn't care.
Same here.
Fight the power.
We can't give up now.
Not when Captain Holt's career is on the line.
We have to get that permit.
How?
The forms don't make any sense.
- I mean, is anything even real?
- No.
Odds are we exist in a computer simulation, but I don't have time to go down that rabbit hole.
Look, the fact that these forms are broken is a good thing.
It means there are many mistakes.
- Mistakes we can exploit.
- That's right.
This is every form SAPO has put out for 100 years.
We have to read every single one and look for miniscule mistakes that will help us get that permit.
So you ready for a kick-ass assignment?
Hell yeah.
Let's do this.
Hey, why'd you want to meet out here?
Because we have a huge surprise for you.
- You found my birth mother?
- What?
No.
The surprise isn't gonna be as good as that I'm sorry I let you guess but -  -  Yeah, after we dropped you at the hospital, we went back and stole it for you.
Now you can give it to your uncle.
Oh, my God.
He's gonna finally let me back in the family.
Fabien, Marco, I don't know how I can ever repay you.
Oh, don't worry about it.
It was nothing.
No, it was everything.
You guys believe in me, and honestly, it saved my life.
Remember the other day at the bar when we first met?
I was all alone and having some pretty dark thoughts.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I was ready to just, uh, give up - Oh, no, Kyle.
- On my rap career.
Oh, went somewhere different than I thought.
- I'm glad that you kept rapping?
- Thanks.
You're the two best dudes I've ever known.
That's nice.
And hey, guess what?
- You did find my birth mother.
- Nope.
I was gonna say you're a great guy, too, but I'm sorry I keep teeing that up.
- But you're looking for her?
- Sure.
Oh, hello, Muriel.
Ugh.
The block party girls.
Look, I told you, your forms don't work.
- You're not getting the permit.
- Right.
But we had a different permit in mind.
This is form 8, as in the eighth form ever written for the city of New York.
Those old forms are all out of circulation.
They should be, but someone made a mistake, and this one was never officially decertified.
Which means it's still valid, which means you have to process it.
"Street closure request for the public humiliation of loose women".
And, as you can see, you are required to expedite processing for the fee of one hay penny.
Keep the change.
Okay, but it says here that the form Must be submitted by a man.
I know.
It's a huge bummer.
- But also - Hi, there.
I'd like to humiliate some hussies, and I'm in a hurry.
Pumping hard or hardly pumping, Gina?
Where were you?
Uh, just so we're on the same page, how long have you been here, i.e., how elaborate does my lie need to be?
- An hour.
- Okay.
The CIA contacted me, and there's some Gina, you cannot use pumping as an excuse to slack off.
- I wasn't slacking off.
- Well, you weren't here.
Man, I was trying to help you.
Ugh.
I know.
I'm sorry, I went home.
I was missing Iggy and I wanted to see her.
Oh, well, you could've just told me.
Yeah, but I was embarrassed.
I thought I'd be as incredible at being a working mom as I am at everything else I do: dancing, public speaking, capoeira, ghost hunting You don't have to keep listing things you're good at.
Earring-making, cabinet renovation.
But juggling things is hard.
I feel like a failure.
I feel like a Coulier.
No, you're not a Coulier, Gina.
Look, being a working parent is hard.
When my twins were born, I made Sharon keep the phone on all day just so I could listen to them.
One month, I used 25,000 minutes.
I'm sorry.
I just realized I told you it sucks and there's no solution.
That's okay.
It's kind of nice to hear this kind of thing from another parent, so thank you.
You know, I don't even think Dave Coulier juggles.
I Googled it.
He doesn't.
Man what a trip.
Rap, rap, spitting rhymes Kissing shorties on the lips Have no fear, Mr. Rap is here And he will drink three beers I wish he would turn the radio down.
You think that's the radio?
That sounds like professional music to you?
All music after Mahler sounds exactly like that.
Now, how do we expect Kyle to transfer the bug to Seamus?
I got him a very expensive bottle of whiskey to give to his uncle as a gift.
The transmitter's in the cork.
We planned for everything.
Oops.
- What was that?
- He broke the bottle.
He Fredo'd it.
Oh, so you didn't plan for everything?
You forgot to idiot-proof the bottle.
Well, perhaps you want to idiot-proof your criticism, because I got him a backup bottle with a backup bug.
It's a good thing I had another one.
Oh, no.
God!
And there goes the backup bottle.
Right, except for one thing: I also put a bug in the keys.
Of course he did.
Guy's got more bugs up his sleeve than Oogie Boogie.
- Don't get the reference.
- "Nightmare Before Christmas".
- Oh.
- Shh, shh, shh.
- They're talking.
- Hey, Uncle Seamus.
- These are for you.
- You found my Rolls.
-  - I'm impressed.
Hey, welcome back to the family, huh?
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Well done.
Well done.
Thank you both.
We did it.
We reunited a family.
Is this what it feels like to be Oprah?
You wish.
OK, here's what we found out from the bug that we placed.
Seamus is planning on stealing $20 million in bearer bonds from an armored truck.
As we speak, the block party is in full swing.
Oh, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.
Here you go.
Turns out, he only wanted a permit so the street would be closed down, forcing the armored truck to divert down a narrow abandoned alley.
It's the perfect place for an ambush, but we changed the truck's schedule, so they hadn't picked up the bonds yet.
Hey, there's nothing in here.
That truck is as empty as Jackson Browne's running surface.
Empty?
"Running on Empty"?
- He sings that song.
- Running surface?
Okay, so Terry didn't like it Charles?
- Don't make me do this, Jake.
- Whatever.
The point is, the truck is empty.
So we did it I can't believe it's all wrapped up.
- Do you even know what we did?
- No.
Just feeling out how close we were to calling it a day.
Soon, Scully.
Now that Captain Holt has repaid his debt without compromising his stupid moral compass, the only thing left is for him to get his tape back, which should be happening right about now.
Oh.
Your block party's going well.
Wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be, but, um, you lived up to your end of the bargain, so.
- I'm a man of my word.
- As am I. Your tape.
You ever want to do business again, my door is always open.
Well, you should close it, lest you get moths.
Good day.
-  - Hey, there, sir.
Top of the mornin' to you.
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
Why do you always assume something's wrong when I come in here?
Couldn't I be bringing you good news?
- Are you?
- No.
Something's terribly wrong.
- It's Seamus.
- What do you mean?
Forensics confirmed the tape he made of me was never copied.
We're in the clear.
It's not about that.
I was checking our bug, and I overheard him talking about what went wrong with the armored car heist.
He's pinning the blame on Kyle.
It has to be him.
Everything was going great until he suddenly reappeared out of the blue.
I bet that dum-dum ran his mouth, and that is the last time he screws over this family.
He's gonna pay.
Did he say what he would do to him?
No, they ran over a huge pothole and then complained about de Blasio for the next hour.
Yes, he needs to do something about the roads.
Look, I don't specifically know they're gonna do something bad to Kyle.
They might just lightly beat him up, so we could do nothing.
- We could take the loophole.
- You do love loopholes.
I know we just put Seamus behind us, but unfortunately, you've made me a better person.
- I think we have to help Kyle.
- Good.
I'm proud of you.
Oh.
Sorry, it's just you said you're proud of me.
That's my tear trigger.
All right.
Let's go save Kyle before the dam breaks.
- - - Hello, Seamus.
- Hello, Raymond.
So, apparently, NYPD police came today to arrest my nephew Kyle for unpaid parking violations.
And you want me to, what, clear his record?
I've already done my favor.
No, I know it's a cover.
I know he's in protective custody because he helped you stop my armored car play.
I don't know what you're talking about.
- No?
- You asked me for a permit, and I got it.
I've paid my debt.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a bowl of mush to enjoy.
You're right.
You don't owe me anything.
But I owe you.
And what, exactly, does that mean?
That means you mess with my family, I mess with yours.
You tell your husband, Kevin, I'll see him real soon.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 This installation is composed of Constantine's accounts of the first Punic War - in the year 264 - Ah, yes the first pubic war, the sexiest of all wars.
Hi, Dr. Albrin Einstibe.
I have an urgent question for you about Ancient Greece.
- Shall we walk?
- Of course, Doctor I feel like you said Einstibe?
Yes, that's correct, it's a family name.
- What is going on?
- Captain Holt sent me.
Just follow my lead.
Your theory is wrong.
The Greeks did not climb out of the Trojan Horse's butt.
- Put this on.
- A rose shearing hat, at work?
- People will think I'm demented.
-  Just put it on.
- Kevin, Dr. Einstibe.
- Ah, professor McGonagall.
- Why is Boyle dressed as me?
- Shh!
- Get in.
- But this cart is Get in!
- Professor.
- Student.
Hello, Kevin.
It's me, Raymond Holt.
We need to get you to safety.
Your life is in danger.
Okay, so we've secured Captain Holt's husband.
Let's discuss how to proceed.
So what you're saying is, we need to talk about Kevin.
-  - I have no regrets!
Kevin is currently at the safe house with Captain Holt.
How long will he have to stay there?
My friend in the Organized Crime division says they've been building a case against Seamus Murphy for years, and they're close.
They think they'll move on him in the next month or two.
So you're saying, Kevin can wait?
You know what, you people are insane.
That was gold.
Okay, two months in a safe house that's not impossible.
It's nothing.
I once stayed in my apartment for 3 1/2 months straight.
- Was that after they cancelled "Bunheads"?
- Why would you bring that up?
I don't understand.
Why can't we just put Kevin into WITSEC?
The Murphys have killed three witnesses in federal protection.
Captain doesn't wanna risk it.
We'll take shifts staying with Kevin.
No, it should just be me.
Look, it's my fault that Murphy's after Kevin.
Captain Holt bailed me out, and now it's my turn to bail him out.
Plus we've got this whole tit for tat thing going, and it's my time to tit.
It's my tit turn.
My time to tit is today, Terry.
You're gonna stay locked up in a safe house, away from us for two months?
That's going to be brutal.
- You just said it was nothing.
- Brutal for me, Gina.
Relax, I'm still going to be able to text and chat with everyone.
It's not like I'm being totally shut off from the outside world.
Say good-bye to the outside world.
You're in the safe house now, so I'll need your phone.
- Why?
- Internet, cellular signals.
- They're too easy to trace.
- Seriously, no phone?
What am I supposed to do to pass the time?
You could learn a foreign language.
Go to hell.
The "no internet rule" was a shock to me as well.
I was hoping to salvage this time to do research on my new book.
But apparently that will not be possible.
I'm sorry, it's for your own safety.
Here, Peralta, let me give you a tour of the safe house.
This is the living room.
- Oh.
- Stop!
You're entering the zone of visibility.
Someone could see you through the windows.
Why don't we just close the blinds?
At mid-day?
That's far too suspicious.
Blinds will only be closed at night.
If you must go into the living room, crawl on your belly.
Observe.
Seems a little extreme.
You're right, it's extreme of me to try to prevent my husband from being shot in the face.
I'm over-doing it.
Kevin, come in here.
- Take your bullet.
- No, fine.
- We'll stay on our bellies.
- Thank you.
This is one of several designated areas where you can stand upright during the day.
You can move about freely in this square.
Wow, so we have all this room to work in?
Your hand can be seen from the living room window.
- You just killed Kevin.
- Raymond I can't hear you, Kevin.
You're dead.
He bled out in your lap.
How will you break the news to me?
Let's see.
- We don't have to do this.
- Ah, Detective Peralta, how are things going with Kevin, the love of my life?
Wait, why are you here at this late hour?
And whose blood is that?
- Okay, I get it.
- It's Kevin's?
This is devastating.
I'm inconsolable.
And I've killed myself.
Cool, well, I can see this is gonna be a fun couple of months.
- - Okay, we can't stream anything, but I brought my DVD collection.
- Do you like Nic Cage movies?
- I don't know who that is.
Only the greatest and most compelling actor of all time.
What are his movies like?
Describe them.
Okay, well, one of them is the FBI has developed face-swapping technology.
Not interested.
- There's a whole plane full of convicts.
- Nope.
On the back of the original Declaration of Independence, there's a hidden treasure map!
- Stop.
- But that's the smartest one!
Oh my God, I'm so glad Captain Holt finally agreed to let you come visit.
I missed you so much.
Me too.
Um is there a way we could get a bit more privacy?
Just pretend I'm not here.
God knows I am.
Okay, I think you're actually going to like this one.
Nic Cage is a chemist Interesting, keep going.
Who has to break into Alcatraz Absolutely not!
Are there no other actors?
It's Captain Holt.
- Hello, Captain.
- And you're both dead.
You didn't ask for the password.
What if I were an assassin wearing a hyper-realistic latex mask?
Or perhaps you employed "Face/Off" technology.
- What?
- I broke down and watched one of Peralta's action films.
I'm lying, I watched them all, including one wherein a man's head turns into a flaming skull.
"Ghost Rider", and "Ghost Rider 2".
Both master-pie.
Yes, I need your help, Raymond.
Luckily, I come bearing good news.
My friend in the Organized Crime unit tells me that they're moving against Murphy tonight.
- Oh, my God, really?
- You're serious?
You mean to say this could be ending?
Peralta, it's happening.
It's finally happening.
Call everyone, we'll get a live feed of the raid and have a viewing party.
"Tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree, 'cause this boy's comin' home".
"Con Air".
What have I become?
Oh, yes, people.
Actual real people that aren't Kevin.
- Hi, I want to touch you.
- Babe, you're being weird.
Right, sorry.
I forgot how to be human.
- Yeah.
- Oh, Charles!
- Ah.
- I need to hear your voice, Tell me what I've been missing at the nine-nine.
Ooh, Terry's grandma got really sick and had to spend a month in the hospital.
Oh that's sad.
I more meant like funny work anecdotes.
Ah, Scully sat on a cherry pie and he didn't notice for six hours.
The tin stayed on the whole time.
Now we're talking.
Did you take a picture?
Honestly, I didn't see it.
I was at Terry's grandma's funeral.
- Come on.
- Everyone, quiet down.
The feed is live and the raid begins in T-minus 60 seconds.
In one minute, Kevin and I will finally be able to leave this awful place.
And yet we'll never be free of the nightmares.
No, those shall haunt us for always.
Whoa, things got really intense in here, huh?
Oh, yeah, it got dark.
This place is a hell-mouth.
- Cool.
- Shh!
They're about to move.
- Bravo team, stand by.
- I love this.
I feel like Ellen watching her producers go through a haunted house.
- Breach, breach!
- They're in.
- There's nobody here.
- Uh-oh, the house is empty!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Where's Seamus?
I don't understand, what's happening?
Someone must have tipped them off.
The raid is a bust, and Murphy's still at large.
So what you're saying is Everyone on the ground, immediately!
-  - Oh no, I sat in another pie.
Damn it!
Next time, sit on a pie when we can enjoy it, Scully.
Organized Crime is hunting for Murphy, but we can't just sit back and hope they find him.
Diaz, where are you with your CI?
They said Seamus' girlfriend Nikki works - in a hair salon in Bay Ridge.
- Nice, classic mistress job.
Hey, my girlfriend's a hairdresser!
And you cheated on your ex-wife with her.
Checkmate.
Well played.
Okay, Nikki won't talk to cops.
So we've got to send someone in as a customer.
Get her to open up, start gossiping.
Send me.
I'm a gossip surgeon.
I can get anything out of anyone.
You can't go undercover, you're not a cop.
How am I not a cop, Terry?
'Cause I don't have a badge?
- Being a cop is a state of mind.
- It's definitely not.
Diaz, the mission is yours.
Great.
I love strangers touching my head.
Sorry, you don't have a choice.
Dismissed!
Actually, Sarge, I have a lead too.
I found the place that provides shredding services for Murphy's companies.
I subpoenaed those shreds.
We can piece them together.
Smart.
How many shreds are we talking?
A few.
Oh, crap.
According to Organized Crime, Murphy has gone to ground, and there are no leads.
Oh, that's great.
If he's on the run, he probably won't be worrying about Kevin.
And if you coat yourself in chum and swim with sharks, you probably won't be eaten.
Said the half-eaten chum-covered swimmer.
While Murphy is at large, he's still a threat.
So I'm going to be stuck here forever, following these over-the-top security precautions?
- No.
- Thank God.
The security procedures are about to become much more over-the-top.
Say good-bye to your one hour of open window time.
But sir, the stench.
It needs some way to escape.
I already feel as though I'm trapped inside of What are those things you're always eating?
- Pizza bagels?
Pizza rolls?
- No.
No.
- Pizza poppers?
Pizzaritos?
- No.
No.
- Pizza pockets?
- That's it.
How much longer will I be forced to live - inside this pizza pocket?
- Look, I could tell you that it'll just be a few more weeks, but you don't want me to lie to you.
Raymond, I beg of you.
Give me two hours at the library to work on my book just two hours.
It will make all the difference.
Yeah, I could go with him, keep him safe.
No library.
Seamus' men could be lurking in the stacks.
- I find that unlikely.
- I understand, but I disagree.
Well then, we are in disagreement.
You'll have to excuse me.
I'm sorry you had to witness such a vicious fight.
- Oh, was that a fight?
- Are you kidding?
He said "you'll have to excuse me" instead of "please excuse me".
Might as well have spit in my face.
- -  Okay, first of all, Rosa, you look amazing.
Secondly, I made an appointment at the salon with Nikki, for you, under the name Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada.
- I had fun with the name.
- Clearly.
Here's the plan.
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada gossips about her love life.
Then, Nikki opens up about hers.
Yeah, this is the problem.
I suck at gossiping.
Which is why I brought along a specialist.
Gina will be in your ear feeding you stories.
I will be basing Gabriella on my sister's friend, Dana.
Just be warned Dana real sloppy.
So, Nikki, I always wanted to get my hair cut here.
Everyone says you're the best.
Oh, my God, I love your earrings.
Where did you get those hoops?
Mmm, I don't know.
Oh no, Nikki's not a talker.
We're screwed.
Don't worry angel, Gina's got this, crackety-crack.
Rosa, repeat after me and don't change a thing.
Can I tell you the craziest story?
One time I was like so drunk And this meathead comes up to me.
And his body is hot, but his face is like okay.
So I'm like, what?
And I was like, bitch, I'm not gonna sleep with you just because you promised to take me to the Bahamas.
Take me to the Bahamas first and then we'll see what happens, okay?
I was only with him because he drove a Jaguar.
Turns out it was a Mercury with a Thundercat taped to the hood.
And that relationship lasted for three months.
I don't know why we broke up.
I guess we just grew apart when he went to prison for life.
I hear that.
The guy I'm seeing is into some shady stuff.
Right?
There it is, the breakthrough.
Follow up, follow up!
So, how'd you guys meet?
That's a funny story, for next time.
You're all done, and you look hot, girl.
No, no, she was opening up.
Rosa, figure out a way to stay in that chair.
Hey, Nikki, I was just wondering.
How do you think I would look  as a blonde?
Like a Danielle Steele novel.
Good oranges, nice and dry.
Not at all ripe.
Fascinating.
My orange is beginning to rot.
That happens when you leave an orange sitting around for too long and refuse to even let that orange go to a library for two hours so it can feel like a real orange again.
You know what really causes an orange to go bad?
Getting shot.
Have you seen what a bullet does to an orange?
I shot a watermelon once.
It's exactly what you want it to be.
- I miss Amy.
- You think I enjoy doing this?
I assure you, I do not.
I'm simply trying to keep my husband alive.
Well, you may not have a husband when all of this is over.
You're not going to die, Kevin.
That's not what I meant.
I'm leaving.
This is an absurd conversation, and you're being ridiculous.
You know what, screw this.
We need a break.
I'm a cop, I can protect us.
We're going to the library.
These two oranges are stepping out.
Oh, damn it, peeling out.
It was right there!
Okay, Captain Holt has back-to-back meetings at One Police Plaza today, which means we have a four-hour window before he checks on any of the security feeds.
But going out into public is a huge risk, so maybe let's go over some self-defense techniques.
Usually, you warn somebody before you do that.
Raymond told me that the element of surprise was crucial.
Cool.
So he's a great teacher.
But I will say this.
If you're going to do a throat punch, it is key that you say something cool afterwards like, "choke on that".
But they're not choking.
They're experiencing airway trauma.
Ooh, how about, "Better get some corticosteroids to treat that laryngeal fracture".
Okay, yeah, that's very informative and quite polite.
But maybe add a "dirtbag" on the end?
But a dirtbag is a useful part of a vacuum.
I don't see how it's an insult.
All right, you know, puncher's choice.
Moving on, we're going to need disguises.
And since we're going to a public library, the best way to fit in is as - Scholars.
- Weird perverts.
Yes, weird perverts is far better.
Far better.
What is the bandwidth on the wifi here?
We have much content to stream.
Bam!
Solid match.
Okay, I've got three words.
I've got an "and", I've got an "an" and a "he".
Now, the "he" could be a part of a "the" or the end of "Apache".
I don't know why, but I'm getting a strong "Apache" vibe.
Amy?
Amy?
- Amy, where'd you go?
- Down here.
I let the pile take me.
I don't know what I was thinking.
We've been at it for two hours and all we've got is three words.
Really two.
Terry's just fooling himself.
"Apache's" a long shot at best.
Ooh, are you guys building a nap nest?
- Mind if we burrow?
- No!
We're piecing together shredded documents - to find Seamus Murphy.
- Can I help?
I'm really good at jigsaw puzzles.
I do them all the time.
It's why my wrist muscles are so defined.
No offense, Scully, but you can't be good or bad at jigsaw puzzles.
It's just putting shapes together.
There's no strategy or reasoning, or logic Look, I got half a page!
He is the one.
This is great.
There's nobody here.
Everyone cleared out as soon as we got here.
Even that actual pervert was creeped out by us.
I can feel your heat.
Ooh!
No offense, but it feels so good to breathe air that didn't come out of your mouth.
- None taken.
- Ooh, I know you're working, but you should probably put something on your screen perverted in case someone comes in like a lady in high heels stepping on a businessman.
Sorry, yes, I meant to do that.
I've just gotten so wrapped up in my research.
I've been reading the most thrilling footnote.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
But don't worry I'll creep them right the hell out of here.
Hello who's sneaking around back here?
Bang, you're dead.
And so is Kevin.
Oh, thank God, it's just you.
Wait, no, this is bad in a different way.
What are you doing?
You brought my husband to a public place?
He's undercover.
We're perverts, see?
You're not fooling anyone.
Kevin's zipper is up, for God's sake.
Wait, I'm confused how did you even know we were here?
Oh, my God, you sewed a tracker into my neck, didn't you?
Don't be stupid.
The trackers are in your shoes, underwear, and wallet.
I also braided one into your hair.
In my tangle?
You put my husband at risk, and for what?
Because you felt a little cooped up?
That's not it.
- You could have cost him his life.
- What life, Raymond?
I spend every day lying on the floor of that house talking with Jake about popular culture.
Do you know what it means to "clap back", Raymond?
Be-cause-I-do.
Enough.
We have to get back to the safe house immediately.
Let's go.
And if you're gonna be a pervert, Kevin, adjust yourself as you walk.
Move some quarters around in your pocket.
So I used to see my boyfriend on Friday nights after his wife went to bed, but then he left town a couple of weeks ago.
You're all done here, gorgeous.
Ahhhh-ha-ha, I love it!
But finish what you were saying.
Where'd your boyfriend run off to?
Oh, that's a story for next time.
Rosa, we're so close, you can't leave.
Tell her you want a perm.
I want a perm.
A big ol' perm.
Great idea.
Go, go, go!
Take a seat.
I can't believe someone took Raymond.
He had a gun, Jake.
It'll be okay.
We're gonna get him back.
Let me just call the nine-nine.
Hey, Rosa, do you guys have any idea where Seamus Murphy is?
We have a huge problem.
Yeah, we all have huge problems.
You kinda look like Phil Spector when he was on trial.
Guys, focus up.
Have you found anything?
One of Murphy's guys just took Holt.
Oh, no.
We did get something from Nikki.
Apparently, Seamus has been staying up - in Rhinebeck, New York.
- Rhinebeck?
Scully, where's that piece of junk mail with the Rhinebeck address?
- Scully, surface!
- Yes, Sarge?
- Rhinebeck letter.
- One sec.
- 8221 Oak Ridge Parkway.
- Copy that.
All right, we're going to commandeer a car, and then we're going to drive to Rhinebeck.
No one is going to hurt your husband this I swear.
Ow, owie, owie, owie, it stings, ow!
Oh, ho, ho.
Follow me.
Hello, Raymond.
So Seamus, are you going to kill me?
No, don't be stupid, nothing like that.
I'm just going to find your husband, bring him here, slit his throat in front of you, then, after you watch him suffer, kill you too.
- There it is 8221.
- All right, let's go.
What?
No, you're not coming in.
It's way too dangerous for a civilian.
You're driving back to the safe house and watching another Nic Cage movie.
You still haven't seen "Gone in 60 Seconds".
His character's name is Memphis Raines.
I'm so sorry.
No, I'm not abandoning my husband.
I love him.
Yeah, I love him too.
Everybody loves Raymond.
- Don't.
- I think that's pretty funny!
- No.
- It doesn't matter.
You got to go.
Get the hell out of here, I got this.
Sir!
Hey there.
- Where is Kevin?
- Don't worry, he's safe.
Look, Captain, I just want to say that I'm sorry.
You should be.
You should have abided by my security rules.
You're right.
But I want you to know, I didn't take Kevin to the library because I was stir-crazy.
It was because I didn't want you guys to get divorced.
How is that any concern of yours?
I don't know, I just I've been around so many failed marriages in my life.
You know, first my mom and my dad, then Charles and Eleanor, Hitchcock and Brandi, Hitchcock and Francine, Hitchcock and Brandi again, - Hitchcock and Madison - Madison wasn't his daughter?
But he dropped her off at college last fall.
I know, it was really gross.
But the point is, I just couldn't stand to see you two fall apart.
Perhaps I should have been more understanding of what Kevin was going through.
I may die here tonight, and his last memory of me will be how miserable I made him.
So, Peralta, what do you have to say for yourself?
The whole NYPD knows where you are, and they're coming for you right now.
Okay, thanks for the tip.
Let's kill them both, get out of here before the cops come.
Wait, no, no, no, I was lying about the back-up.
I came alone title of my sex tape.
Doesn't matter.
You're both gonna die now.
Better get some corticosteroids to treat that laryngeal fracture.
Sorry, I couldn't bring myself to call him a dirtbag.
And why would you?
A dirtbag is a very useful part of the vacuum cleaner.
Clearly, it's a compliment.
Wow, you guys are so perfect for each other.
Oh, my garsh!
It's all the same.
Nothing has changed.
- Except for that.
- This perm saved your life.
And I thank it for its service.
Hello, Captain.
Hello, Kevin.
So, here's an update on Seamus.
Thanks to our little operation, the FBI was able to roll up his entire organization.
They're saying it's going to be one of the most significant RICO prosecutions they've ever done.
- Amazing.
- It's over now.
He can't hurt me or Kevin.
Thank you, for titting my tat.
Well, thank you for tatting my tit.
And you know, in a weird way, I'm going to miss our little house.
Yes, and in an even weirder way, I think I might actually miss you.
And in an even weirder way, I want you guys to be my dads.
- That is weirder.
- Yeah, I got stuff.
I brought you your box of DVDs.
Oh, thank you.
Oh!
Forgot about this one.
We never watched "Captain Corelli's Mandolin".
What the hell did you just say?
- "Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?
- Say that to my face.
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?
There was a movie about a mandolin, and you kept it from me for two months?
Well I didn't think it was any good.
- It's just some period piece.
- What?
- Set in Greece.
- Oh, my God.
Based on some dumb book.
Aah!
Terribly sorry.
It has been a very trying time.
Yeah, next thing, you're going to say you'd wished we had watched "Leaving Las Vegas," a dark, ponderous reflection on alcoholism that earned Cage his Oscar.
- Aah!
- What?
I told you, the guy's got range!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1 Peralta, there was a botched B & E at a jewelry store on Atlantic that just turned into a hostage situation.
They want you to be the negotiator.
Oh, my God, my prayers have finally been answered.
You prayed for a hostage situation?
Yes, I did.
Every single day.
I don't understand.
Why isn't ESU handling this?
Apparently, the hostage-taker asked for Jake by name.
Oh, yes, it's getting even cooler.
Oh, man, I wonder who it is.
Ooh!
Maybe it's the brother of someone I put away for life.
Ooh!
Or the identical twin of someone I put away for life.
- Ooh!
Or the fraternal twin of - Jake!
Just get down there!
Take Diaz with you.
Yep.
Yep, yep, yep.
How do I look?
It doesn't matter.
Let's go negotiate!
Hey, everyone, I'm here.
I'm Jake Peralta, the negotiator.
- Oh, so you're Jake Peralta?
- The negotiator, yes.
- Who are you?
- Dennis Kole, ESU.
This was my crime scene before you bozos got here.
Nice to meet you too, Dennis.
I've spent ten years as a negotiator and you just took my first hostage situation.
All I've done up till now is talk jumpers off of rooftops.
But that must be satisfying in its own way, right?
Yeah, really satisfying saving a crazy person's life.
Whatever.
Here's a little advice.
- I don't like you two.
- Not so much advice as it is a hurtful statement based on limited interaction.
He wants to talk to you.
- Get the hell in there.
- Ooh, it says "negotiator" on it.
This is Jake Peralta.
I am unarmed and I'm approaching the building - You wanted to talk to me?
- Keep those hands in the air.
And wave 'em like you just don't care.
What?
I'm just messing with you, Peralta.
Put your hands down, give me a hug, baby.
Judy!
Sergeant, a member of the Commissioner selection committee is coming in today to tour the precinct and do some interviews.
Would you mind speaking with her?
Of course.
Terry loves answering - the hard questions.
-  Oh, here she is.
I guess you don't have time to take off those ridiculous suspenders.
- What?
- Hello, Miss Sumter.
Hello, Captain.
I'm excited to speak to you subordinates and learn more about your management style.
I thought you could talk to Sergeant Jeffords here.
Sergeant?
Oh, um I'd rather not talk to a supervisor.
I was hoping to interview one of your detectives.
Perhaps, um him?
-  - No!
- Excuse me?
- There was a wasp near me, which has since disappeared.
You can interview Detective Hitchcock and I am completely fine with that.
I gotta admit, man.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
- Why you being so weird.
- Oh, I don't know.
I didn't sleep well last night, so I'm probably tired from that.
Oh, and also, this is a hostage situation!
Wow!
It's like that.
Yes, it's like that.
What the hell?
- I thought you went straight?
- I did.
I'm a high-end car broker now.
I procure luxury vehicles for the rich and famous and I do it legally.
Last week I dropped off a Bugatti to the kid with the lisp from "Stranger Things".
You met Dustin?
Was he cool?
Do him and the rest of the gang hang out in real life?
You know what?
No.
We are not chatting right now.
You have three hostages.
You mean Pam and the two Bobs?
They not hostages.
I prefer to call them "collateral friendships".
I gave 'em each 500 bucks out of my own pocket.
- Thanks again, Doug.
- You the man, Doug.
Actually, I'd rather still not be a hostage.
Pam hasn't come around on me yet.
Tell her I'm a nice person, Jake.
I'm sorry.
Officer, are you friends with this criminal?
- No, not really.
- Absolutely, best friends.
It's a layered relationship, Pam.
- Best friends.
- Judy, get over here.
- What is going on, man?
- This isn't my fault.
Two years ago before I went straight, I stole a car from a drug dealer.
- Martin Halloway.
- Oh, no, Judy, he's a bad guy.
I know.
When I realized it was his car, I torched it along with the drugs that were in the trunk that I didn't know about.
Oh, no, Judy.
Trunk drugs?
Millions of dollars of them.
Halloway just found out it was me.
Said I had to do a job for him to pay off my debt.
But did you tell him you went straight?
- Did you tell him about Dustin?
- I did.
He said he doesn't watch "Stranger Things".
- Oh, this guy is the worst.
- I know.
He said he's gonna kill my mom if I don't do this job.
He can't do that.
I love your mom.
So do I. That's why I'm here stealing this big ole bag of diamonds.
Jake, you know how dangerous this dude can be.
I need you to help me save my mama.
- Help you how?
- Easy.
I got a plan that's good for everyone.
All I need is for you to Let him go so he can arrange a drop with Halloway.
We arrest Halloway, save Judy's mom, and Judy turns himself in, and why is that amazing, Rosa?
- Halloway's a huge crime boss.
- And what else?
NYPD's been trying to get Halloway for years.
- And?
- That's it.
Yeah, it is.
So, since we all agree, I'll go tell Judy that the plan is on.
We don't all agree.
He's trapped and desperate.
Everything he told you is a lie.
- Why do you say he's lying?
- That's all negotiating is.
Two liars lying to each other until one liar stands too close to the window and gets shot in the head.
That can't be all negotiating is.
It absolutely is.
Now, get in there and coax him to a window.
Snipers to one.
The window plan is on.
I repeat.
- The window plan is on.
- No, no, no, no, no!
Snipers to zero.
Snipers take a nap.
The nap plan is on.
It's nap time, snipers.
Amy, Gina, you came!
You think I'd miss opening day of your food truck?
- I'm your biggest fan.
- Also your biggest investor.
She was freaking out she was gonna lose a ton of money.
I told you that in confidence.
We don't have that kind of relationship.
Well, don't worry.
I'm feeling good.
"The One Thing" truck is ready to serve.
- "The One Thing"?
- Yeah.
We only serve one thing: the perfect meatball sandwich made exactly the way Nana Boyle used to.
I can't believe this is finally happening.
- Ahh!
- Uh, Charles?
Sorry, I'm a bit stressed.
Jason and Jeff, the guys I hired to work the truck, called in sick so I'm all alone.
What a fun opportunity.
Okay, Boyle, stop freaking out.
I have the day off.
I can step in and help.
Yeah, me too.
I'm not off, but I come and go as I please.
It's part of my charm.
I'm like an outdoor cat.
ESU won't take your deal.
They think you're lying.
I'm not lying.
I don't wanna be a criminal.
I love my life as a average citizen.
I voted for the first time this year.
- Ed Breakfast for school board.
- Who?
I don't know.
He had a funny name.
He deserves a shot.
That's why I voted for Stacy Ladle.
Anyway, I'm sorry, but they're not cutting a deal.
So that's it?
I gotta turn myself in - and let Halloway kill my mama?
- Actually there might another way to get this done.
I've taken your negotiator hostage.
If you come in here, I will shoot him.
Just do whatever he says!
My life is in his hands!
-  -  - That was so much fun!
-  Oh, man, you sounded really scary.
No, no, it was all you.
The tremble in your voice sold it.
- "Just do whatever he wants".
- I just made that up.
- Ah, I was so in the moment.
- Dude, seriously?
- You are a great hostage.
- Oh, thanks, Judy.
You're a great hostage taker.
Whoop.
Both: Yes, sir.
I can't believe Peralta got taken hostage.
The good news is I'm the negotiator now.
- Finally.
- Congratulations.
I've been waiting for this moment for so long, - and -  I'm ready to negotiate.
But I'll only talk to Rosa Diaz.
- That's me, Dennis.
- Oh, come on!
Okay, I think we're ready for a practice sandwich.
- Sounds good, boss.
- Please call me "chef".
That's funny.
- Chef.
- Thank you.
Okay, see.
The cut is a little slopey.
I want you to cut it straight across.
No big deal.
Again.
Oh.
Uhp, slopey.
Don't over think it.
Again.
Now you're not thinking enough.
Again.
Still slopey.
Again.
Again!
You know what?
Why don't we try this: Why don't you just take that knife, put it to my throat, and finish the job!
- Huh?
- Do I look like Jake to you?
- What?
- Do I look like Jake to you?
- No, not at all.
- Then why are you trying - to screw me?
- Oh, my God, Charles, - what is going on with you?
- It's chef.
You're not ready for this.
Gina, you're up.
Okay, but I'm not calling you chef, - and you're not yelling at me.
- Mm-hmm.
- There you go.
- Ah, thank you.
No slope!
A nice, straight cut!
Thank you.
I felt good 'cause the knife But you smushed the bread!
It's too smushy!
Again.
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa Are you finally single?
- No.
- I respect that Now come on in.
We gotta talk business.
It's so good to see you.
Bring it in.
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.
- Wait, Rosa, stop.
- What's going on?
All right, look, this is not really a hostage situation.
I mean, Pam and the two Bobs are definitely being held against their will, but not for much longer.
Jake is helping me take down Halloway.
- We can't do it without you.
- Seriously, man?
This is like that story my dad told me as a little kid.
You're the frog and he's a scorpion.
You're gonna help him across the river.
And in the end, he'll sting you, - and then you'll both drown.
- Wow, that's dark.
My parents didn't read to me at all.
I just watched cartoons till I fell asleep.
Do you think that our childhoods shape - the adults we become?
- They do.
And cartoons shaped you into a naive little frog.
Okay, first, little frogs are adorable, and second, he's not that kind of scorpion anymore.
I'm a changed bug.
Actually, scorpions are arthropods.
Amy made me watch a documentary.
Look, I know he used to be a criminal and he's fooled me in the past, and he is currently engaged in criminal activity.
Innocent until proved guilty.
- But I am doing it.
- Rosa, his mother is in danger and we have to help her.
Plus, he agreed to turn himself in when this is all over.
- Right, Judy?
- I promise.
All right.
-  - What do you need from me?
We have an airtight plan.
All we demand is pizza.
Hitchcock, there's a woman here interviewing detectives a part of the Commissioner selection process.
All right, I'll go hide in the janitor's closet until this is all over.
Thanks for the heads up.
No, it's too late for that.
She wants to talk to you.
What?
No!
How could you let this happen?
- I'm nuts!
- Hey, calm down, man.
We just took her on a tour of the precinct and how she's at lunch.
That means we have one hour to teach you how to behave like a human.
Oh, I see.
- You're gonna "My Bare Lady" me.
- "My Bare Lady"?
I'm assuming it's a "My Fair Lady" porn parody.
Oh, my.
We've got our work cutout for us.
Here's our list of words to avoid: Chick, foxy, Jew, throb.
Is grundle on the table?
No, it's not on the table.
Practice introducing yourself.
Hello, I'm Detective Michael Hitchcock.
Nice job.
- But why are your hands so wet?
- Trick question.
The answers disgusting, so I shouldn't tell her.
Just don't have wet hands, man.
-  - Hitchcock, come out.
- It's time.
-  You look incredible.
You bet I do.
These pants really flatter my dong.
What?
Dong wasn't on the list.
I cannot believe I didn't know you and Amy were getting married.
Yeah, well, you're not exactly - an easy person to find.
- Right, right, right.
I am elusive as hell.
So, is there a La Creuset pot - on your registry, by chance?
- Of course.
You can cook and serve in them.
And it looks amazing on your shelf.
What's your color of preference?
French grey or mineral blue?
Oh, you really do know your Le Creuset.
French grey.
Mineral Blue makes me want to barf.
Consider it gifted.
Also, it would me my honor, - to sing at your wedding.
- Yeah, I don't think - that's gonna be possible.
- Oh, I get it.
You're afraid when I open my mouth.
Everyone's gonna start smushing on sight.
No, I more meant that your probably still gonna be in jail.
Damn, that's right.
I almost forgot.
Tell you what.
I'll record you some songs.
"Kiss From a Rose" really exploits my range.
-  - We have your food.
Why are we sending him in?
One of my men should do it.
It would take two of your people three trips each to hold this much food.
My guy's a pro.
I've been carrying takeout since before you were born, son.
Fine, but I wanna know what's going on in there.
We're putting a camera on him.
You're on camera.
No audio.
Thought so.
That's why I'm tied up.
Scully, where the pepper flakes?
Will you calm down?
The food's a diversion.
Although, Scully, it is crazy that you forgot the pepper flakes.
Anyways, you know what to do now.
What I do best.
Turn my heart off.
- What just happened?
- Looks like Scully collapsed.
What the hell?
Your man just had a heart attack!
Send an ambulance!
We're coming out.
Something doesn't feel right.
Why is there a sheet over his head?
Because that's not our guy.
- Judy's trying to escape.
- There's no way he could All units move on the ambulance now!
- All units - Move, move, move!
Nice try, Judy.
- Hi, there.
- Nice work, Dennis, you just caught a man having a medical emergency.
Why was there a sheet over his head?
- Couldn't find his pulse.
- Yeah, it's super weak.
We got movement.
Hostages are coming out.
Hostages are coming out!
What the hell is going on?
Does anyone have eyes on Judy?
Where is Doug Judy?
So glad Scully put the uniforms in with the pizza.
I keep finding hidden pepperonis.
Oh, man, all I got was a pocket full of lettuce.
- Jake, I got you.
-  Ooh, a garlic knot.
Okay, let's ride.
We'll be safe here.
I know the owner.
He'd never turn me in.
Yeah, I have the exact same relationship with the guy who runs the laser tag place I love.
I mean, gun range.
Peralta, who you out here stuntin' for, huh?
I love laser-T.
We gotta go sometime, man.
I was hoping you'd say that.
- I wasn't stunting.
- A little bit.
- A little stunting.
- You stunted.
A little bit.
All right, let's text Halloway - and set up the drop.
- Okay, yeah.
Got the diamonds.
Let's meet.
-  - Done.
Okay, now we wait.
Now we wait.
Kind of weird, sitting silently in a private karaoke room, not singing.
Yeah, but we're on a mission, so, you know, gotta stay focused.
True, true, true, true, true, true.
Both: So I wake in the morning And I step outside And I take a deep breath And I get real high And I scream at the top of my lungs What's going on?
-  - Uh-oh.
- Halloway.
- Yeah.
The drop is set for 5:00 p.m. - Let's do this.
- Totally.
Although that is an hour and a half from now.
And the drop point is actually pretty close to here.
Both: So And I said hey yeah, yeah, yeah Order up, chef.
What is this?
Why are you making - six sandwiches at once?
- It's more efficient.
Now we're ready for the next five customers.
Who gives a hump about efficiency?
The perfect meatball sandwich is sauced exactly 70 seconds before being served to maintain bread integrity.
So sandwich number one will be fine, but sandwich number six will be a soggy turd.
Change in menu.
We're serving soggy turds now!
- Get 'em while they're wet.
- Okay, I quit.
Me too.
You're insane.
Fine, quit just like Jeff and Jason did.
You told us they got sick.
They got sick of hard work just like you two!
Get out!
You'll never cook in this town again!
- We're not chefs!
- And you never will be.
Is Hitchcock doing okay?
I think so.
Wait.
He's bringing his hand to his face.
Don't pick your teeth.
Don't pick your nose.
Oh, dear, he's going to lick something off his fingers.
Oh, no, he's stroking his chin.
As if in thought.
Not as if.
He is in thought.
Oop, they're looking at us.
Act natural.
- Spreadsheet, spreadsheet.
- Crime, crime.
- Precinct, precinct.
- Yeah.
We swept the area.
No sign of Doug Judy or Peralta.
I can't believe that idiot thought he could just waltz in here and do my job.
It's hard to be a negotiator!
My first 50 jumpers, 49 died.
You only talked down one person?
No, he jumped too, but he landed on this woman who broke his fall.
She died, but you can't count that against me.
- I definitely can.
- Yeah, well, save it.
Peralta's the one who got himself taken hostage.
I don't think he was a hostage.
He's pretty good friends with that Doug guy.
What?
Diaz, what the hell is going on?
First, a jeweler will come out and inspect the diamonds.
Then, when he gives the okay, Halloway will come and get them.
And then I'll take him down.
All right, that's the signal.
Here we go.
What's up, dude?
Anybody ever tell you, you look like the most interesting man in the world?
You get that a lot?
Jeez, I get it.
We're not friends.
I'll find another bocce ball partner.
There he is.
Halloway, it's your day What's up, Mr. Halloway.
How you doing?
Shut up.
Give me the diamonds.
Man, I guess the no-small-talk policy - starts at the top.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Peralta!
- No, no, no, not now.
I tracked your phone, idiot.
-  - Judy wasn't lying.
That's Halloway.
We gotta arrest him.
- Jake, he's running.
- Come on, man.
Only if I get the collar and 100% of the credit.
Are you negotiating right now?
Always.
Okay, that was actually a really cool thing to say.
All right, let's do it.
Judy, stay here.
Okay.
Stop!
Sorry I ran out on you at the jewelry store.
I just couldn't let this guys get away.
Look, man, I'm fine with it.
Arresting Halloway's gonna get me a promotion, and at the end of the day, that's what this is all about.
Right, well, that and getting a major drug lord off the streets.
Let me give you some advice.
I don't care about that.
You know, you should really look up the word advice.
I think you might be surprised what you see.
All right, let's bring in Doug Judy.
Oh, no!
Where is he?
Doug?
Don't worry.
We'll get him.
At least we have Halloway and the diamonds.
- Doug!
- Wait, why are you - still calling for him?
- Doug!
Oh, my God, he has the diamonds, doesn't he?
Doug!
I'm sure Judy didn't run off with the diamonds.
I bet he's looking for us right now.
You know what, I bet he's worried that we're in trouble.
I'll just call him and put his mind at ease.
Dude, he's already gone.
He's not picking up.
- What's up, Peralta.
- Ha!
He did pick up.
In your - This is good-bye forever.
- No!
Ugh, I can't believe you deceived me.
I can't believe you used my love for your mother - against me.
- I love that you love her.
Of course I do.
She's a living saint.
Amen.
Look, I wasn't lying though.
Halloway was gonna hurt her and you saved her life, but then I was all alone with the diamonds, next thing I know, I'm hot wiring a car and driving away.
Oh, but I thought you liked being a good citizen?
You voted Ed Breakfast for school board.
And he immediately had a sex scandal.
- It was very disillusioning.
- For sure.
Our democracy is crumbling.
But what about your job?
What about Dustin from "Stranger Things"?
Famous kids are monsters.
You do not wanna meet Young Sheldon.
Really?
Ah, that's disappointing.
He was so good in "Big Little Lies".
Wait, no, we are not talking about this right now!
They could take my badge, Judy!
I guess Rosa was right.
I'm scorpion.
Scorpion's gonna scorp.
I'm sorry I can't be the man you want me to be.
Damn it, stop being so romantic.
Now turn around and come back to me, you fool?
Hello?
Hello?
He's gone.
He broke my heart.
Now's the time where you tell me everything's gonna be okay.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- You don't know that, Rosa!
Ah, Hitchcock, I just got off the phone with Anne Sumter.
She said you really helped my candidacy.
- Oh, it's my pleasure, sir.
- You were so professional.
I know.
I didn't even fart once.
You're right.
I can hold it.
You know, if you can change for an interview, - you can change for good.
- Nah, too much work.
But that's not how "My Fair Lady" ends.
Eliza Doolittle doesn't go back to her old life.
She falls in love with Henry Higgins.
Well, "My Bare Lady," is a little different.
It's not Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins.
It's Eliza DooEverybody and Leroy Pipe.
And in the end, they rub Nope.
We don't need a recap.
- Thank you for your help today.
- Anytime, Captain.
Hey, guys.
Uh, can we talk?
Let me guess, you got overwhelmed and had to use our six-sandwich technique.
No, my one at a time system worked perfectly.
- Oh.
- It's just, making Nana Boyle's meatball recipe got me thinking a lot about her And let me guess, you realized she'd be ashamed - of how you acted?
- No, Nana Boyle was a monster.
She once yelled at me so loud, I fainted.
She was a hateful witch.
- She died with no friends.
- And let me guess, you realized you were acting just like her and you felt terrible.
- Yes.
- You see, Amy?
You don't do "and let me guess" - until you're sure you're right.
-  Can you guys forgive me?
Please?
Of course, Charles.
But we will never work for you again.
Yeah, that's a smart move.
It's like Jekyll and Hyde.
I can't control when Nana comes out.
Just got off the phone with the brass.
It doesn't look good.
They're still trying to decide on a punishment - for your actions.
- Well, did you tell them I feel so bad I have a tummy ache?
I did.
They were unaffected.
They said they could have justified your tactics if you'd come away with Halloway and the diamonds, but as things stand, there are no diamonds.
Well, there are some diamonds.
You know, the tops of engagement rings, diamond mines, but, yes, I see what you're saying in regards to these diamonds and it ruining my career.
You're looking at a suspension, maybe worse.
Unless you can track down Doug Judy - and recover those diamonds.
- Can they wait 12 months?
I usually run into him about once a year.
Wait a minute.
What have we here?
I've got this coupon for a private room.
Yes.
Right this way.
We already have a song cued up for you.
Judy.
What's up, Peralta?
Thank you so much for coming.
Look, I thought about it and I did you dirty.
I never meant to cause you any trouble.
Yeah, well, you caused me a lot.
You're talking to a pre-recorded video, but it's cool.
I know what you're saying.
- I hear you in my heart.
-  What am I doing here?
I feel the same way.
You my best friend too.
Look, I'm not coming back.
I started a new life here in San Diego.
Stupid telling me where you are.
Come on, man, I ain't in no damn San Diego.
Everybody knows that place sucks!
Here's what I wanna say, though: I'm sorry I won't be at your wedding.
But I did record you a CD of original smush jams that will consummate the marriage.
It's on the table next to you along with a little something else.
A French grey Le Creuset pot.
Now look inside it.
The diamonds.
Yes!
I cannot believe you actually - brought them back - The diamonds!
- Yeah, mistimed that one.
- No, you're the best.
Look, even though I am a scorpion, I will never drown your adorable little frog ass.
So that's what I had to say.
I'm sure I'll see you again at some point.
Now that coupon you got there, that's for a full hour in a private room.
- so - So Both: I said hey What's going on?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1  Oh, yeah.
I'm Philip Davidson.
Detective Jake Peralta asked me to drop by.
Mm, the dentist who murdered someone.
Spoiler alert: they think you did it.
Can you show him to Interrogation Room C, please?
- Have fun in there.
- Thank you.
What are you smiling about?
How uncomfortable this guy is.
Jacked up the thermostat, got the table all sticky, made one of the chair legs too short, and worst of all, I had Gina greet him.
- What did you have her do?
- Be herself.
- Poor son of a bitch.
- Yeah.
Why are you wearing a tuxedo?
Kevin and I are attending the opera.
Ooh, the opera.
Is it the one Bugs Bunny sings?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- So, who's this?
- This is Philip Davidson.
- What do we have on him?
- Clear motive, clear means, and a nonexistent alibi, but the DA won't bring a charge because he says it's all circumstantial.
We want to bring this guy down, have to get him to confess right here, right now.
Mm.
An interrogation with a ticking clock and everything on the line?
I better call Kevin and tell him I won't be attending the opera.
There's someone else I'd rather hear sing.
- Oh, damn!
- Hello, Kevin.
I won't be joining you at the opera tonight  Oh, sorry, I didn't know you were on the phone already.
-  Oh, damn!
- It's under my name, H-O-L   You're right.
He did it.
But we have no murder weapon, no witnesses, and you really didn't find any usable forensic evidence?
The body was discovered rotting in the Pine Barrens.
It'd been rained on for weeks and chewed up by coyotes.
The only other DNA other than the vic's was some bear semen found in the hair.
- Right.
Who found the body?
- Hikers.
You're really just gonna blow past the bear semen detail?
I imagine a bear mistook the rotting corpse for a female of its species and had intercourse with it.
- Nothing I haven't seen before.
- It isn't?
Let's get in here.
Start working this guy.
Oh.
You're gonna come in with me.
I just thought maybe you'd watch from out here, you know, pull me out when I'm getting too hot.
Call me a loose cannon.
You know, classic Captain stuff.
Peralta, do you know what I miss most about being a detective?
A good interrogation.
Breaking suspects down.
Talking quietly and then talking real loud.
Looking away and then looking right in their eyes.
Leaning.
- That was amazing.
- So, can I join you?
Well, a lot of these techniques do work better with two people: you know, good cop/bad cop, crazy cop/sane cop, fast-talking streetwise cop and Hong Kong cop, AKA the "Rush Hour".
You know what?
Let's do this.
Let's break this son of a bitch!
- Hello, Philip.
- Detective.
This is Captain Raymond Holt.
He's a bit of a legend in interrogation circles.
Hey, Cap, who's the scariest person you've ever gotten - a confession out of?
- Connie Buttons.
Okay, thought it was gonna sound a little cooler, but no matter.
So, shall we recap the night that Robert Tupper was murdered Friday the 22nd?
I believe you were the last person to see him alive, correct?
No.
I'd imagine whoever killed him saw him after I did.
Ooh, nice dodge.
You're quick, like a cat.
- Like a dancer.
- Like Great Tiger.
From "Mike Tyson's Punch-Out".
He could teleport around the ring.
Most people thought it was impossible to get past him.
I beat him every time.
You just punch him when he gets dizzy.
Really?
!
I mean, duh.
- Everyone knows that.
- Tell us about Friday.
I had a late afternoon surgery.
Simple gum graft.
It wrapped around 6:00, and then Robert and I talked after.
And who else was in the office?
Our hygienist and anesthesiologist had gone home, and Grace, who usually locks up, had left early because her grandson had a school play.
So it was just you and Robert.
- No witnesses?
- That's lucky.
It wasn't lucky because there was nothing to witness.
Robert just wanted to talk about firing one of our office assistants, Cheryl.
- And that's all you discussed?
- Yeah.
- Nothing else?
- Nah.
Zero other subjects were mentioned?
- None.
- Not even how gross gum grafts are?
They're really not that gross.
Liar!
About the gum graft thing, and about the meeting.
We just talked about Cheryl.
Right.
And, of course, there's no way for me to check if that's true, because because whoever took Robert's phone wiped all of his calendars.
Except it was all backed up on his home laptop.
Would you like to hear what he said the meeting was about?
"7:00 p.m. Talked with Philip about" Missing meds.
Ooh.
Did I get that right?
Uh, yeah.
But "missing meds" hardly sounds like "firing Cheryl," so maybe you want to explain He thought Cheryl was stealing Diazepam.
That's why he wanted to fire her.
Any other questions?
Uh  Boy, you really thought you had him with that one, huh?
- Well, I - You got so excited for it.
Let me guess, you, ah, practiced that notebook flip?
- Well, yes, obviously.
- I'd like to move on, unless you have any other big revelations in here.
Let's see.
"From Gomez: Dear Morticia, I feel so happy when I'm wit' ya".
I was just spit-balling wedding vows there.
So you said you and Robert were partners, but it was Robert's name on the business, correct?
Yeah.
He started the practice and then I joined after.
Uh, Captain, something's come up in the case.
Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
What the hell are you doing in there?
You totally undermined me.
I know, and I apologize, but I'm executing a strategy.
Oh, really, and what strategy might that be?
Make Jake feel like an idiot, or make Jake feel self-conscious about his Addams Family-themed wedding vows rap?
No, I want Philip to underestimate you and fear me.
I'll badger him with my superior intellect, while simultaneously belittling you.
Once Philip dismisses you as a threat, I'll leave you alone with him, and he'll let his guard down.
If I didn't know any better, I would say you're describing smart cop/dumb cop.
Look, I thought you had him on the calendar reveal.
-  - But he was a step ahead.
You got flustered, and I realized in the moment we could use this to our advantage.
So what do you want me to do, ask stupid questions?
Stupid questions, grammatical errors, lose your train of thought, just ask him to confess ooh, relate everything back to those movies you've seen.
Kinda seems like a shot at me about "Die Hard," but okay.
This is not a comment on you, Peralta.
I just want to bring this guy down.
Yeah, that's all I want too.
And to possibly say, "You can't handle the tooth".
You know, if it comes up naturally.
- It won't.
- It might.
I actually think it can't.
So what do you say?
Me want to.
- Dumb cop.
- I got that.
- Yeah.
- Well done.
- Mm-hmm.
- So, the night of the murder, you met with Robert in the surgical suite.
Why there?
Why not your office?
Uh, just preparing for the next day's surgeries.
Don't you have an assistant who does that?
I'm a meticulous person.
I'm careful how I do things.
So careful that you I'm sorry, I forgot what I was gonna say.
Come back to me.
Now, we did a sweep of the room where you and Robert fought.
- Talked.
- Right, talked.
- The entire room had been scrubbed.
- It had been cleaned.
It had undergone industrial sterilization to remove all traces of blood and DNA.
It's a surgical suite.
People bleed in there every day.
We have to sanitize it by law.
Ooh, I remembered what I was gonna ask.
- Did you kill him?
- No.
Ah!
If you had said yes, I woulda had you!
So,  after you and Robert fought - Talked.
- You left the office, but you didn't take your car?
I went to a bar, The Scotchman.
I didn't want to drive drunk, so I took a cab.
And you didn't have your phone?
I left it charging in my office and I didn't realize till I was already out of the building.
Oh, man, if I go ten minutes without looking at my phone, my pumpkin crop dies on my little farm.
This is not the time for stories about your digital squash, Peralta.
- Fine.
- Talking about your phone.
Why does it matter that I forgot it?
Ohhh, if I had it on me, you could've seen it pinging off the cell tower.
Doesn't matter.
Didn't have it on me.
So you took a cab to this bar.
Well, we talked to the employees of the Scotchman.
- Nobody saw you there.
- Nobody remembers seeing me.
But let me ask you this did you kill him?
Nah.
You know, it's not surprising nobody remembers seeing me.
The bar was extremely crowded that night, and I spent my whole time in the corner talking to this woman, Dana.
Oh, so you said.
But when we ran all the credit card receipts, nobody named Dana bought any drinks that night.
Trust me, Dana wasn't buying her own drinks.
- No?
- No.
Okay.
- Hold on.
- Hm?
I need to deal with this.
Let's take a five.
Or I could keep this interview going solo.
Of course.
I'm sure that'll be, um pretty helpful.
All right.
Where should we start-a-rooski?
Don't you think maybe we should just wait till your boss comes back?
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Because you're scared.
You know I'm playing hardball, except for that the balls are questions.
And here they come.
What kind of car did Robert drive?
Also, Dana from the bar, what color was her hair, and which night does the cleaning crew sterilize your office, and have you ever been up to where the body was found, and when you left your phone at the office, was it plugged into your computer or an outlet, and did you kill him, and what did your cab driver look like?
This seems like a huge waste of time.
But, here you go.
Robert drove a Saab, Dana's hair was blonde, they sterilize on Wednesdays and Saturdays, I haven't been to Vernon in 20 years, the phone was plugged into the wall, no, I didn't kill him, and the cab driver had a beard and an earring I sorry I didn't get his license number.
Wow.
- Very impressive.
- Yeah.
You didn't fall for my "did you kill him" gambit.
No.
Although it is interesting that you knew the body was found in Vernon, New York, when that information hasn't been released to the public.
Well, hello, Dolly.
I can't believe you thought I was the dumb cop.
I mean, I've watched "Planet Earth".
With the British narrator.
I can tell you anything you want to know about "three-toed slow-ths" and I got you to say you knew where the body was found, which kinda seems like something only the murderer would've known.
Actually Robert's wife told me.
I've been talking with her a lot, comforting her.
We asked her not to share that info, and she promised us she didn't.
Well, she's been distraught.
She might not remember.
Uh-huh.
Flimsy.
So what did you mean when you said that you hadn't been to Vernon in 20 years?
My uncle has a cabin there.
I would visit him as a kid.
Wow.
So your uncle owns a cabin in the town that the body was found.
That is quite a coincidence.
I haven't been there for 20 years.
You can call my uncle if you want.
Oh, we are.
So you might as well just confess now, or we can take our sweet time like the mer-jestic slow-th.
Either way, we've got you.
- We don't have him.
- But I just told him we did have him.
Philip's uncle said he hasn't been to the cabin in months and he hasn't spoken to Philip in over a year.
Well, what about the neighbors?
There's only one other house off that road and we haven't been able to contact the owner.
Yeah, but Philip doesn't know that.
He's rattled right now.
We tell him the neighbor saw him that night, he'll crack for sure.
- So you want us to lie?
- No, I want me to lie and for you to stand behind me and say, like, three oh damn 's when I really get cooking.
All right, fine, two oh-damns.
- One oh-damn?
- There will be no oh-damns.
But it will be so satisfying in your deep, powerful voice.
- We're not lying.
- It's legal.
The Supreme Court said that we're allowed to lie in an interrogation.
I told a perp that I knew Steph Curry a couple days ago.
It had nothing to do with the case, - but I could say it.
- It's a tactical mistake.
You're guessing what happened that night.
But what if Philip never went to the cabin?
He did.
I can feel it here.
- Your stomach?
- No, my gut.
Your gut, or intestines, is lower.
You should point down here, closer to your pubis.
- I'm good.
- Suppose you're wrong.
Now Philip knows we have nothing.
There goes our credibility and our leverage.
No, we need a different strategy, All right, fine.
How about this I convince him I'm unstable.
I run in there screaming, I throw a chair through the two-sided mirror, glass goes everywhere.
He's like, "If Mad Dog Peralta will do that, who knows what else he's capable of"?
No offense, but you don't get angry well.
What?
That's not true.
Remember how angry I got about how fast Daenerys got from Dragonstone to north of the Wall?
That was intense.
You have a boyish face and a big goofy grin.
It's like being yelled at by a children's cereal mascot.
Hey, some of those are scary.
Count Chocula much?
All right, fine, I see your point.
What do you suggest?
Let's get all up in his personal space.
- Make him feel uncomfortable.
- Okay, fine.
Let's get intimate.
-  - So, Philip, you're hanging out at the bar with "Dana".
How late did you stay?
I got in the cab around 3:30.
Kinda hard to find a cab in that neighborhood.
Why not a ride-sharing service?
Didn't have my phone, remember?
- Did you talk to the driver?
- No.
What route did you take?
I don't know, I was watching Taxi TV.
- What was on?
- Fallon highlights.
- What was he doing?
- Slow-jamming the news.
- Who was the guest?
- Amy Adams.
- Who's that?
- Famous actress.
- Why would you - Wow.
You got some old silver fillings in there.
You probably want to drill those out, replace 'em with porcelain.
- Okay, but why - And that is some serious plaque buildup.
- Let's get back to - No, no, no.
Open wider.
Let me see.
Good God, when is the last time you had a cleaning?
Damn it!
Not only did we not break him, but now I have to go to the dentist?
!
We need a new strategy.
And all this dental talk has given me an idea.
- Okay.
- We have a few more questions for you, doctor.
Doctor.
Huh.
It's funny when people call dentists "doctor".
We are doctors.
We do four years of medical school.
Yeah, but it's called "dental school".
But we learn about the entire body.
But if you had cancer, you wouldn't call a dentist.
You know it's actually harder to get into dental school than medical school.
Well, because there are fewer dental schools.
Because most people want to become actual doctors.
That's ridiculous.
It's not like we're college professors calling ourselves "doctors".
- Not the same thing, my friend.
- Well, sure it is.
When someone has a heart attack on a plane, do they yell out, "Yo, does anybody here have an Art History PhD"?
A PhD is a doctorate.
It's literally describing a doctor.
- Maybe let's refocus.
- No!
The problem here is that medical practitioners have co-opted the word "doctor".
- Okay, Captain - I know we live in a world where anything can mean anything, and nobody even cares about etymolo  Apparently that's a trigger for me.
Yeah, apparently.
So now can we lie?
No, no.
But you know what often works?
Making him confront his victim.
Look your dead friend in the eyes and say his name.
Robert.
Okay, maybe say his full name.
- Robert Tupper.
- His middle name's Henry.
Robert Henry Tupper.
His wife called him Rob.
Work that in.
- Rob Tupper.
- Work it into the full name.
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.
Now say it with a frown on your face.
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.
Now try not to blink, so tears come to your eyes.
Robert "Rob" Henry Tupper.
Man, this guy is a good murderer!
There's got to be some way to break him.
Wait a minute.
I just had an idea.
Two, three, four.
Yeah, I really got to stop trying that.
It never works.
Tell us more about your relationship with Robert.
We've been over this a thousand times.
We got along well.
So you never fought, at all.
About anything.
I mean, we worked together.
We disagreed sometimes.
But we had a good partnership.
He never, for instance, skipped a party so he could micromanage me as I tried to do my job.
That's what's happening here, right?
That's why you're wearing the tuxedo?
I skipped the opera, not a party; it's no big deal.
Yeah, it's the Bugs Bunny one.
And I'm not here to micromanage anyone.
I'm here because I enjoy interrogating scum.
- Scum like you.
- That was implied.
I just thought we had a good rhythm going.
- We do.
- I know.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You don't think the fact that he skipped the opera has anything to do with him not believing in you?
He believes in me.
Okay.
Why did he make you dumb cop?
He didn't make me dumb cop, not that it's any of your business.
We agreed on it as a strategy.
Right, but why wasn't he dumb cop?
Please.
You never would have bought that.
- What?
- It's just that, um, between the two of us, you are more believable as a - Dumb cop?
- Yes, dumb.
Uh, the-the dumber of two smart options.
Wow.
Rough.
All right, that's enough.
You're not interrogating us.
- We're interrogating you.
- Exactly.
Tell us about that Diazepam.
If Cheryl didn't take it, then who did?
Because we're pretty sure it was you.
Honestly, it could have been any one of our employees.
They all have access to the storage room.
You know, it's silly, but, uh I trust the people who work for me.
I'm telling you, Captain Holt is only in here because I want him here.
Really?
So you're in charge?
And all those strategies you've been coming after me with, those were all your ideas?
Right.
The guitar thing was mine.
And you signed off on that?
- Well - Seriously?
- Ooh, this is sad.
- Shut up.
- I just feel bad for you.
- I said shut up.
Your boss thinks you're an idiot; that can't feel good.
All right, listen, you son of a bitch, you think you're smarter than us?
You think you've gotten away with it?
You haven't.
We're gonna find something.
One skin cell, one eyelash, one tiny inconsistency in your story, and you're gonna spend the rest of your life in prison.
Everyone who loves you will leave, and you will die alone!
And at that time, it will be your head that a bear has sex with!
I'm pretty sure you're going for angry, but in my mind, it just seems like when a Muppet gets upset and starts going like -  - Oh, you want angry?
I'll show you angry!
Do you feel like I lost the upper hand?
Because I still think it's about 50/50.
I told you getting angry wouldn't work.
Well, your brilliant ideas haven't gotten us anywhere either.
I'm telling you, the only thing that's gonna work is lying about the cabin.
That would be a huge mistake.
- It'll work.
- No, it will backfire and jeopardize the entire case.
Oh, so Philip is right, you don't trust me at all.
Stop it!
You know you're one of my best detectives.
So let me do this my way.
I did.
I let you do it your way, and it was a disaster.
I had to jump in with the dumb cop gambit to rescue the interrogation.
-  - I'm sorry.
I know you're frustrated, Peralta.
But the fact is, we don't have enough.
We may not get a confession.
It happens.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
This guy has just really gotten under my skin.
- Mine too.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom and try and clear my head.
- I think that's a good idea.
- Good.
Oh, no, Peralta, what are you doing?
Guess what, you dick?
I just got off the phone with Vernon PD.
Oh, no, no, no.
Your uncle's neighbors saw you go into the cabin the night of the murder.
They ID'd your photo.
I've got you dead to rights.
Interesting.
But, uh, my uncle only has one neighbor, and I'm pretty sure he didn't identify me.
Oh, really?
Because you were so careful?
Because he's been dead three years.
Well.
I'm friends with Steph Curry.
So So, this is how it looks to me.
You were lying in an attempt to frame my client.
No, no, no, no.
Look Even if we were lying - about having a witness - Which you are.
- The neighbor's dead.
- No, it could've been a squatter or a hunter or a squatting hunter, not all hunters have homes Peralta's point is, legally, he can say whatever the hell he wants - in an interrogation.
- True.
But that doesn't play so well with juries.
You screwed up, and my client's leaving.
No!
He can't leave until I dismiss him.
You've had him for ten hours and 45 minutes.
15 more and we file a harassment claim.
Great!
Then I'll just keep him for 14 minutes.
Seriously?
Just to be childish?
Yuh doy!
I told you not to lie!
What were you thinking?
!
I thought it would work.
And I wanted to be the one that got him.
Is this about your ego?
Are you that desperate for everyone to know how great you are?
It's not about everyone.
Okay?
It's just I wanted you to know.
Oh, my God.
I got it!
He's not answering any questions.
That's okay.
I have no questions.
That's right.
I'm about to monologue, son.
You better make it quick.
You only got eight minutes.
All right, then let me paint you a picture of Philip, a successful periodontist that's become addicted to Diazepam, a sedative I take because I'm junkie scum.
Also, for real, addiction is a disease.
I would be super empathetic if you hadn't murdered a man.
- What is the point of this?
- I'll get there.
So, one day I'm working late when my boss Robert surprises me.
He found out I was stealing meds again, junkie scum also again, not your fault.
There's a major genetic component to addiction.
He says he's gonna file a police report.
I could lose my license.
We fight, and something in me just snaps, so I grab the first thing I can find, and I hit him with it.
You still have no murder weapon.
I do now.
Here's a pic I found on Yelp of the surgical suite six months ago, and here is a shot that our crime scene photographer took of the same room two weeks after the murder.
- Notice any differences?
- We're not answering that.
That's all right, I can just tell you myself.
The Yelp shot has six of these heavy-looking glass awards from the Brooklyn Periodontics Society in the background, whereas this shot only has five.
What happened to number six?
- Murdered Robert with it!
- I didn't.
You lost all control and you bludgeoned him to death.
There must have been blood everywhere, but you got lucky.
You were in the surgical suite; it can be sterilized.
You never would have gotten away with it in your carpeted office.
- That's not what happened.
- Don't say anything more, Philip.
And your office manager would have heard all of the screaming but she was at her grandson's play.
- Lucky again.
- You're wrong.
You put Robert's body into a wheelchair and shoved it in the elevator.
It's a miracle there wasn't blood everywhere.
- That's not true.
- Now you're in the garage with a corpse.
You panicked and left your phone in your office, and you don't have your car keys, but Robert's are in his pocket so you put him in his car - and you take off.
- No.
- You can't believe what you've done.
- No.
- Philip.
- You're flustered.
You have no GPS, so you just start driving.
- No!
- Philip!
Next thing you know, you're in the Pine Barrens, and it hits you: your uncle's cabin.
He has a place there.
You're the luckiest son of a bitch - It wasn't luck!
- Yes, it was.
- You got lucky at every turn!
- No.
I knew exactly where I was driving, I left my phone in the office on purpose, I was in the surgical suite by design, and I didn't use some glass award that any idiot would clearly see was missing.
I made a rod out of a special dental polymer, killed him with it, then melted it back down.
It's already in a patient's mouth son!
Oh, damn.
Oh, damn.
Oh, damn!
And that is three oh-damns.
Oh, damn!
Ohhh.
Fresh air.
Wow, I don't say that a lot.
There's one thing I still don't understand.
Did you know you had the wrong murder weapon?
Ah, excellent question, sir.
Yes.
I spotted the missing dental award when I first took the case.
I asked around weeks ago.
Turns out a cleaning lady knocked it over and shattered it.
Then why did you run in there like that?
Because in talking to you, I realized what Philip's worst fear actually was: that we would think he was just some dummy that got lucky.
Right.
He had planned the perfect crime.
And it killed him when you said he was sloppy and impulsive.
He needed us to know how smart he was.
Right.
Like someone else I know.
Yup.
Kevin.
I'm proud of you, Peralta.
Thank you, sir.
Now let's go get some sleep.
Hey, guys.
My goodness.
We're almost late for work.
Oh.
Well, in that case, good morning, sir.
Good morning, Peralta.
God, I love this job.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
1 Santiago, your test results from the sergeant's exam have arrived.
Ooh, everybody make room.
Amy needs adequate space to do her signature dork dance.
I don't know if there's going to be a dork dance.
I mean, look how small that envelope is.
That's not a big, good news envelope.
That's a little, bad news envelope.
What?
That's nuts.
Sarge, tell her envelope size - doesn't matter.
- If I'm being honest, - I got a much bigger envelope.
- Oh, God.
Unhelpful, Terry.
Very unhelpful.
- Mine was bigger, too.
- Okay.
I just won't ever open it.
That way, I'll never get rejected.
- Fine, I'll open it.
- No!
-  - Oh, whoa!
-  - Do it harder.
I opened it.
- You passed.
-  Oh, my God.
I'm going to be a sergeant.
You're going to be a sergeant!
- Yes!
-  Oh, no, it's happening.
Whoo!
-  Yeah!
- That's my future wife!
So  Amy Santiago, put down that melon, for you are about to feast your eyes on one of the most delicious cases in the NYPD.
I don't like the personality I've chosen here.
I do.
You sound like Caesar Flickerman welcoming new "Hunger Games" tributes to the Quarter Quell.
- What's going on, Jake?
- In one week, you will officially become a sergeant.
Which means this case will be the last one we ever work together as detectives, so it has to be perfect.
I present to you a serial arson case.
- Mm-hmm.
- And the fires seem to be connected to the Saturday crossword puzzle.
- Mama like.
- Two different buildings, two consecutive Saturdays, and a puzzle left at each crime scene, and a note was sent to the puzzle's author, - Mr. Melvin Stermley.
- Melvin Stermley?
He's the best in the game!
He made a puzzle once where all the answers were just the word "puzzle" in different languages.
- In Estonian, it was moistatus.
- Yeah, well, your moistatus is about to be hecka moist don't call HR, we are getting married because Melvin Stermley is coming in - to help us with the case!
- Sha-wing!
Hey, I was going through your calendar for some reason.
- It's your job.
- Right.
Anyhoobs, I wanted to remind you about the commissioner candidate meet and greet, and your presentation to the selection committee.
Being that I am your campaign manager - You are not.
- I did a little sleuthing on your rivals.
You want me to spill the beans?
Why would you ever intentionally spill beans?
They're one of nature's most densely packed protein sources, and they remain unsullied by flavor.
Okay, forget it, I'll just mosey on out.
Fine, fine, tell me everything.
All right, have a seat.
It's Gina time.
Say hello to your compe-tish.
Bryan McCann, John Kelly, and John Kelly.
Yes, that's right, there are two John Kellys.
How are these not the same man?
You should see their wives.
Or should I say, wife.
Good God, do you know what their speeches are about?
I do.
"Staying the course".
"Maintaining the course," and "Blazing a path to a new future".
I'm kidding, it's "Remaining on the course".
Unbelievable, none of these men have any interest in advancing the NYPD.
That's right, because they're dinosaurs.
But do you know what kills dinosaurs?
- Asteroids?
- No.
You-steroids.
You are going to kill these dinosaurs.
Hey, hey dum-dum.
What are you thinking?
Introducing Amy to her celebrity crush?
- Are you insane?
- Relax, Charles.
It's not a crush, it's her nerdy crossword puzzling hero.
I mean, the guy's got to be a massive dork.
His name is Melvin Stermley, for God's sake.
Jake, he's here.
Come meet Melvin.
Hey, you can call me Vin.
But, where is nerd?
Whoa, is this a new detective car?
It sure is, I put in the paperwork 18 months ago, and got lucky.
They fast tracked it!
Say hello to the Nine-Nine's brand new, fully loaded, sweet-as-hell crime-crusher on wheels!
Holy crap, it has a heads-up display with built-in license plate reader.
Who cares.
It's got two burrito holders.
- Those are cup holders, Scully.
- Oh yeah?
Then what am I supposed to use my thighs for, genius?
Wait, who are you assigning this car to, Sarge?
Um, I was actually thinking I'd get this one.
- Seriously?
- You suck.
Whoa, the heater in my detective car hasn't worked in two years.
I don't have enough body fat to keep warm, Terry's sick of shivering.
Okay, just seems a little selfish to keep it for yourself when your detectives, who you took an oath to protect, are stuck driving their crappy old cars.
- Mine's the oldest.
- I've never felt so abandoned.
And I was actually abandoned.
They found me in a swamp.
Fine.
We'll do a drawing for it.
But until then, no one touches it.
Oops, too late.
I left a ranch handprint on the windshield.
Okay, so here are your puzzles from the days the arsonist set the fire.
This is really good, Amy, thanks.
Hey, so Vin, just curious.
Would you say you have the typical physique of a puzzle maker, or?
Well, each puzzle only pays a couple hundred bucks, so I mostly make my money modeling.
- Primarily swimwear.
- Yeah, I hear that.
I could do that too, but I make pretty good money here, so I don't really need to.
Anyways, let's talk about the case.
So here's the letter that the arsonist sent to Vin.
"Your clues I discombobulate to teach you to conjugate, the fool who fails to validate will watch as I conflagrate".
It seems like he's using my crossword to tell me something.
Oh, maybe we should look at anagrams of the answers.
That's really good, "o nasty amiga"!
-  - Oh, what?
He re-arranged the letters of "Amy Santiago".
He anagrammed me!
Vin, do Jake Peralta.
- I doubt that's even possible.
- Eat a jerk, pal.
What, no one's ever said that phrase.
I really think this anagram approach makes a lot of sense.
Seriously?
Let's do it.
I'll take even clues, you take odds.
Great, and I will take everyone's coffee order.
- That's equally helpful.
- I don't drink coffee.
- But I'd love a kombucha.
- Great, I'll just walk to the kombucha store.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, of course.
You can't wear a coat over a tank, - You're not Ryan Gosling.
- Feeling jealous, buddy?
No, not at all.
I mean, I am a little surprised that somebody named Melvin is so bodacious, but I feel that jealousy is an ugly emotion.
- That you are feeling.
- And I'm just glad that Amy is spending some time with her hero.
- Who is super hot.
- Charles, let it go.
- And smart.
- I'm serious, stop.
And hilarious.
Eat a jerk, pal!
So, how's it going in here?
Vin, I see you're still coatless.
- I run hot, like a wolf.
- Oh, I see.
I wonder if the word "conjugate" in the arsonist's letter means we should - focus on the verb answers.
- Cool, I love verbs.
- Second favorite part of speech.
- Both: After prepositions.
Yeah, words are cool.
But maybe we should switch gears a bit, and get back to some good old-fashioned police work.
- What are you thinking?
- Well, whoever's setting these fires is clearly trying to humiliate Vin.
You know, make a puzzle he can't solve.
So maybe we should focus on people that don't like you.
Jake has a point about motive.
Maybe another puzzler wants to take you down.
Well, if you're looking for a puzzle head, I'm hosting a crossword night at the Turnkey Bar tonight.
Oh, I've always wanted to go there.
That place is a total puzz-hang.
Ah, gross, all right, so we'll go undercover, chat some people up, and see if we can't find our arsonist.
- Good idea.
- Oh, Amy likes my plan.
Great, so Vin, why don't we just get this coat back on you, and I'll help you get out of the door, here.
And we'll see you tonight, okay, bye!
-  The best.
- Right?
Yeah!
Wow, the competition looks even older in person.
What do you think these dinosaurs are talking about?
Where to find "Matlock" reruns?
Be professional, Gina.
Like the homecare nurses who will tuck them into bed tonight.
- Oh, hello, John.
- Raymond.
I just want to say what an honor it is to be up for the same job as a man with your experience.
Thank you.
I paused suggestively before I said "experience," so he would know it wasn't really a compliment.
Who are you talking to?
I invented the pause.
Raymond Holt, I'm Captain Olivia Crawford.
I'm the new candidate for commissioner.
- Oh?
- Excuse me?
Yeah, I replaced the other candidate.
He retired to spend more time with his grandchildren.
Anyway, I just wanted to say what a privilege it is to be up for the same job as a man with your tenure.
- Oh, damn, she paused, dude.
- In error, I am certain.
Olivia, I may be older than you, but I am not some dinosaur intent on maintaining the status quo.
For example, I would add a social media officer - to every precinct.
- Interesting.
I plan on eliminating precincts all together.
What, no precincts?
That's not how we do things.
That's exactly what both John Kellys said.
Oh no, she's the asteroid.
And I don't want to say you're a dinosaur, but  You're a dinosaur.
Wow, a whole crowd full of puzzlers.
Gotta be honest, I'm a little disappointed no one's wearing a green suit covered in question marks.
That guy has crossword puzzle pants.
- Does that scratch your itch?
- Very much so, thanks.
All right, we should probably start talking to people in line.
Pardon me there, fellow puzzler.
What do you think of Melvin Stermley?
Uh, you mean my future husband?
Oh, so you like his puzzles?
And his face, body, and brain and body.
Honestly, Vin makes all other men seem really stupid and ugly.
Okay, well, thank you for your very candid and hurtful input.
You must solve one of Vin's puzzles to enter.
Rearrange the letters of this phrase to reveal a place in the world.
Jake: "Meet a brainier stud, a." Oh, come on, there's no place with that many letters in it.
I mean, most places are, like, four letters.
- You know, park, mall, dump - United Arab Emirates!
- You may enter.
-  Uh, you must each answer a puzzle.
Oh great.
Unscramble the letters in this phrase to reveal the name of a film based on a classic novel.
- Okay.
- "Sad anus loser, I go in" You know, I feel like these puzzles are actually very pointed.
Forget it, I got this.
Uh, A, R, uh  Puzzle solved.
Who's the anus loser now?
It's still me.
Okay, one of us is about to get access to the best detective car ever, and everyone else will go back to driving junk cars for the rest of your junk lives.
Damn, Sarge, that took a dark turn.
I want seat warmers.
I want them bad.
I need this car too.
I'm sick of riding my Vespa to work every day.
Well, being on the seat behind you is no picnic either.
All right, here it goes.
What?
Oh, my God, it says "Terry".
I won!
Terry got a car, Terry got a car No way.
You cheated.
What?
I didn't cheat.
I bet every slip in there says Terry.
He filled it full of fake people.
- Who the hell is Norm?
- That's Scully's first name.
- It is?
- Stop being sore losers.
I won fair and square.
No, you won unfair and un-square, - and I'm going to prove it.
- And if we can't, - we'll plant it.
- No.
Charles, I need your help.
What's the best way to dry out a pant leg that's - been soaked in toilet water?
- Wait 28 minutes.
Trust me, that's how long it takes for toilet pants to dry.
Well, I can't just be standing around for half an hour while Amy chats it up with Vin.
Ah, so it's not toilet water.
You're drenched in jealousy.
I told you before, jealousy is an ugly emotion that I don't feel.
Besides, Amy picked my plan to come here.
Why would I be jealous of Vin?
Because of his body, and face, and brain and body.
Why does everybody say "body" twice?
-  - Oh, hang on a second.
- Somebody's coming.
- Vin is on fire tonight.
- He's phenomenal.
- No wonder the Saturday crossword replaced Sam with him.
- Sam must be pissed.
- I heard the only place that buys his puzzles now is "Parade" magazine.
The hardest clue he had in his last one was a five-letter word for a game - popular in nursing homes.
- Bingo.
I figured out who the arsonist is.
It's this guy named Sam.
He's a puzzle maker.
- And Vin took his job.
- Sam Jepson?
Oh, he's not the arsonist.
He's been out of town for weeks.
And he's one of my closest friends.
He let me stay on his couch when Anna Kournikova and I broke up.
Well, I mean, she never won a major, so.
All right, fine, if I'm so wrong, what did you guys find?
Both fires were located at the intersection of numbered streets.
If you match those intersections with the same intersections of the numbered clues in the puzzles, you get the letters "MA".
We think the arsonist is spelling his name.
We can build a puzzle around that, and catch him setting his next fire.
But we have a suspect with a crystal clear motive.
I think we need to solve this like cops, not puzzlers.
I hear you, Jake.
But people who make crosswords love hiding their names in their puzzles.
It's our version of a self portrait.
All right, you know what?
Amy, it's your last case, you decide.
Should we go with Vin's wacky little plan, or should we go with Sam Jepson, my exceptionally solid lead?
I see where you're coming from, Jake, but this is Vin's world, and I think we should go with his strategy.
- Sound good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sounds great.
- Okay, great.
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.
Oh, no, ugly emotion.
Okay, so we think the arsonist is using the fires to spell out his name.
The most common third letter in names that start with "MA" are L for Malcolm, X for Max, R for Mark, and T for Matthew.
Or his name is Sam, and he's spelling it backwards.
Uh-huh.
Let's just stick with the LXRT plan.
- Copy that.
- Vin designed today's puzzle using only one of each of those letters.
Isn't that the craziest thing you've ever seen?
I don't know, I mean, remember that time we investigated the disappearance of Mrs. Jackson, and it turned out her parrot ate her, bones and all?
- That was pretty crazy.
- That was crazy.
- Yeah.
-  So tonight, we'll stake out the intersections that correspond to where the L, X, R, and T are in Vin's puzzle, and hopefully catch the arsonist in the act.
I'll take the MAT corner, you take the MAR corner, and we'll have patrolman take the MAL and MAX.
- Cool?
- Yep, very cool.
Okay, great, I'll get the surveillance equipment.
Shame.
Shame, shame, shame.
I can't believe you're doing Vin's plan.
Will you relax?
I'm only doing it because someone else is going to do my plan.
- Who?
- You.
- Oh.
- While I'm busy watching nothing happen on my stupid corner, you're going to stake out Sam's apartment.
Then when he sets a fire, Vin is going to look like a dummy.
That's right, use the jealousy, Jake.
It will give you unimaginable power.
Yes, yes, I can feel it coursing through my veins.
- Oh, my hand cramped.
- Oh.
Oh, it's stuck in a claw.
- It's a claw now.
- Oh.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?
You're snacking?
This is from the guy who told me that eating finger foods was the one true sign of depression?
Then watch me chew, Gina.
I'm a creature of the past.
I'm a dinosaur.
No, you are not, you're the best man for the job.
And I think you know what you have to do to get it.
Believe in myself and give a great presentation?
Not even close.
That's the head of the committee over there, gorging on crab cakes.
Just go up to him and sabotage Olivia.
Um - I don't think I can do that.
- Well, you can't really be the best commissioner the NYPD has ever had if you're not the commissioner.
Right.
You're right, I want this.
And I will do good things for the city.
Yes, you will.
Now, get over there, and crap all over Olivia's ideas.
- Patrick, nice to see you.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Shall we small-talk?
- Mm.
I've been thinking recently about how vital the existence of precincts is to the NYPD.
Oh, you spoke to Crawford.
She's very forward thinking, isn't she?
I suppose you could call it that.
I mean, I wouldn't, but Ray, you don't need to worry about her.
Between you and me, we had to nominate a girl for PR reasons.
There's no way the NYPD is ready for a female commissioner.
- Oh.
- Hey.
Grab a crab cake before we start.
Real crab, big chunks.
Okay, no one saw Sarge do anything suspicious on the day of the drawing.
We got nothing.
Speak for yourself, sister.
We found a smoking gun.
Play it, Hitchcock.
- Voila.
- Bah-boom.
- What, I don't see anything.
- Focus on the butt.
- The butt don't lie.
- He squeezed his cheeks before he opened the slip.
He knew his name was on it.
It was a pre-emptive celebration clench.
I don't know, we need better proof than a butt clench - to take down Terry.
- I did it, okay?
I cheated.
I wanted that car, and I took it.
And it's killing me.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I just kept hearing the blinker.
You-cheat, you-cheat, you-cheat.
Here are the keys.
Take the damn car.
Terry doesn't deserve it.
And that is why I became a cop.
Hey, Charles, nothing's happening on my MAR corner.
- Any movement at Sam's place?
- No, I did, however, see a cool-looking dude in a ponytail on a Razor scooter.
I have to admit, I like the look.
Is it possible I'm wrong, and Sam is out of town?
Vin's plan is actually kind of smart.
- Jake, I have eyes on Sam.
- Yes, suck it, Vin.
My judgment is clear, and I am a genius.
Charles, I'll be right there.
But enough about the crab cakes.
Our first presentation tonight will be from the 99th precinct's Captain Raymond Holt.
Raymond?
Let me begin with a hilarious joke.
I'm surprised I was on the short list for commissioner.
After all, I am six feet tall.
Actually, what I have to say tonight is no laughing matter.
I was just told by a member of the selection committee that they have no intention of ever choosing a woman to run the NYPD.
I suppose I should have been relieved, because Captain Crawford is a damn qualified candidate.
But as someone who has been denied opportunity because of who I am, I cannot stand by and watch it happen to someone else.
So, I will be reserving my presentation for a selection committee that will judge all of the candidates fairly.
And let's be honest.
The crab cakes were only so-so.
-  - Thank you.
All right, talk to me, what's happening?
- What's Sammy up to?
- Well, he just sat down - on the plaza.
- Okay, he's opening up his backpack and pulling out what appears to be a thermos.
Possibly containing some sort of accelerant-like gasoline.
- Yup.
- No, he's eating it with a spoon.
It's soup, he's eating soup.
Well, maybe he's fueling up for a night of starting fires.
He just pulled out a lighter!
Nope, it's not a lighter.
It's a bumblebee PEZ dispenser.
- Hmm.
- Ooh, he's making a phone call.
Quick, get the parabolic mic.
-  - Mom, I did something bad.
Yeah, you set some fires.
I proposed to Gretchen, and she said no.
- So you set some fires.
- So, I left Myrtle Beach.
Two weeks ago, and then you set some fires.
No, I got back home today.
Yeah, all my fish were dead.
Okay, so Sam didn't do it.
I should probably get back to my corner.
Just for the record, just because I was wrong about Sam, does not mean that Vin was right.
-  - Well, this is disappointing.
I can't believe you left your post.
What, the plan wasn't yours, so you didn't think it was worth following?
Well, because of your juvenile behavior, one of our city's finest abandoned lard factories is now burned to the ground.
My gut told me that Sam Jepson was setting the fires.
Although I now realize his actual life is much sadder than that of a serial arsonist.
But we agreed to do Vin's plan.
So what?
Vin is not a cop.
Why do you keep siding with him instead of me?
Oh, let me guess, because he was right, and the building was on fire, and he's perfect?
Wait, are you jealous of Vin?
Jake?
All right, I didn't want to say anything because it's a gross emotion, but yes, I am a little bit jealous of the super smart supermodel.
This was our last case together.
And you and him have been joined at the hip.
Or in his case, that super sexy V muscle that I don't understand how to tone.
He told me, it's a lot of bicycle crunches.
Crunches on a bicycle?
That's crazy, you would just fall right off.
Babe, you have no reason to be jealous of him.
I just I don't want you to wake up one day and with that you were with someone as smart as you are.
I am with someone as smart as I am.
You.
You're a brilliant detective.
I love the way you think.
That's why I want to marry you.
Marry me.
Marry.
Oh, my God, look.
The arsonist spelled MAR, but they were going to spell M-A-R-R-Y!
Or Conjugate.
Conjugate means marry!
Yes, and who wants to marry Vin?
Both: The lady from the bar!
Hey, puzzle chick, unscramble this.
You're going to "ailj".
All right, Sarge.
The car is yours.
What?
Why?
- I don't deserve that car.
- I don't know about that.
I went back and watched the tapes to figure out how you did it.
Right before the drawing, you got a peanut butter cup out of the freezer.
The thing is, you don't eat sugar past 4:00 p.m. Could have been a cheat day.
Oh, it was definitely a cheat day.
You froze your slip of paper, so that when you pulled the name, all you had to do was find the cold one.
So.
You thought the way I cheated was so cool, you gave me the car?
Yeah, but also while I was watching those tapes, I noticed all the nice crap you do for people.
You got Gina a cushion for her chair.
You let Charles show you 130 pictures of Nikolaj brushing his teeth.
You Heimlich'd Scully twice.
- On the same peanut.
- I also solved a murder.
Yeah, we all solve murders, but you, you let Hitchcock borrow a pair of your socks, because his somehow disintegrated.
Anyway, I'm sorry I guilted you in the first place.
- You deserve that car.
- Thanks, Diaz.
How did you get Hitchcock and Scully to agree to this?
I washed their car and told them it was a new one.
They're napping in it right now.
Smart!
- Hello, Captain Holt.
- Ah, Captain Crawford.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Captain Crawford is here to see you.
Thank you, Gina.
So, it would seem that we have become frenemies.
- Do you know what that means?
- Are you trying to imply that I'm too old to understand a portmanteau?
I am not, but I am too dignified to use one.
Friend-enemy.
I just wanted to thank you, for your brave speech.
The mayor's office has replaced the selection committee with a less biased one, so.
Feel free to start calling me commissioner now.
The only time I plan on calling you is to hear you concede.
It's going to be hard to hear anything once I've crushed you into a fine powder.
A fine powder that will choke you until you die.
May the better candidate win.
She will.
Captain Crawford left.
So, we brought her in this morning, and she confessed immediately.
Hi, Vin, I love you!
Did you see my fires?
Turned out, she was writing something.
Specifically, "marry me, or else I will kill you.
Yours forever, Helen Gorbelson".
- Wow, that's so many fires.
- So many fires.
Thank you for catching her.
With a brilliant puzzling mind like yours on the case, it was only a matter of time.
Actually, Jake solved it.
He's kind of a genius with this stuff.
Oh, thank you, then.
Couldn't have done it without your help.
So I guess that's that.
I should probably run if I'm going to make it to the Javits Center by four.
They're making a mold of me for the upcoming Bodies Exhibit.
As they should, your body is great.
- And that's okay.
- Thanks, man.
You should join me for a puzzle night sometime.
- Oh.
- No!
Jake is taken.
He already has a friend.
Hang out offer declined.
Now let's strut your centerfold ass out of here.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
- Pigeon's still here?
- Yeah.
No matter what we do, he just won't leave.
The problem is you're thinking like detectives.
- No, I'm definitely not.
- When you should be thinking like a bird.
- - This is Operation: Saving Private Pigeon.
On my mark, I will turn on this fan, gently startling our bird due east, into the file box canyon, where he will encounter Charles holding two pot lids.
He'll bang them together, forcing Private Pigeon into the ceiling there and out of the ceiling there, where he will be greeted by scary Rosa holding a scary picture of an owl.
Now he's playing our game.
He'll veer left, into an upside down garbage can propped up by a hockey stick and connected to a string that Gina is holding.
She pulls it, he is trapped, and Terry releases him outside.
- Terry hates birds.
- Okay, little friend.
Let's get you home to mama.
Oh, God.
It flew right into the fan!
It's everywhere!
There's pigeon everywhere!
- Hey, Boyle.
- Hey, Jake.
- Wait, what?
- Hey, Jake.
Ahh!
Bill, what are you doing here?
I thought we agreed to meet only once a year for the Halloween Heist.
I'm here to deliver your quarterly NutriBoom shipment.
It comes with both the amino acid reducer and extra amino acid, so you get the perfect balance.
What?
No.
I only signed up as a one-time payment bribe.
I'm not selling NutriBoom.
It's clearly a pyramid scheme.
First off, it's not a pyramid scheme.
It's a conical-tiered multi-flow-through medical marketing entity.
And secondly, you signed the contract.
"Permission to charge my card quarterly for the next 85 years".
This is written in white ink on white paper.
They do it that way so you can't read it.
Well, I did read it and I'm canceling the contract.
Canceling?
If it was that easy to get out, would I be here scamming my closest friends?
We're your closest friends?
What whatever, I'm not accepting the shipment.
Jake, piece of advice: just give up.
It's the Boyle way.
It's why our family crest - is a white flag.
- That reminds me, Charles, - your shipment's downstairs.
- Great.
- I'll help you bring it up.
- Charles, no.
We're gonna go down to that office and fight this thing.
I need that money for my honeymoon.
Oh, my God.
The honeymoon is on the line?
- And your money.
- Eh.
Okay, great.
Whatever gets you onboard.
- Let's go.
- For the honeymoon - and no other reason.
- All right.
Sergeant Santiago, commander of the Nine-Nine's uniformed officers, - reporting for duty.
- Hey!
My first order as Sergeant, tell me I look dope.
- You look dope.
- You won't be abusing your power like this with the officers downstairs, will you?
No!
No, of course not.
I'm just excited for my first day.
Yes, I remember my first day as a sergeant.
- I bet.
- My Uncle Geoffrey was struck by a subway and maimed.
- Oh.
- But the work aspect was quite exciting.
Are you ready for your first briefing?
Yes, I am fully prepared.
I just wanna establish myself as a leader right away.
Just be confident, deliberate and firm.
You'll know you have their respect when you can take a moment and still keep their attention.
- Amazing.
- That was captivating as hell.
My recommendation would be you start with a small, attainable goal something you can accomplish quickly, perfectly and publicly.
The best way to lead is to always achieve all your goals.
Cool.
That's not a ton of pressure.
Well, it was meant to be.
Pressure's an important part of success.
Just remember, you represent all Latina policewomen right now.
Thanks.
Hello.
Welcome to NutriServices.
I'm Angela.
How can I heal you today?
Hi, Angela.
Creepy greeting.
So not a big deal, there was just a little bit of a mix-up and we need to cancel our NutriContracts.
Absolutely.
It happens all the time.
All you need to do is sign a few things.
Ah.
See, Charles, that is why you never give up.
- I'll also need $10,000.
- What's that?
I'm sorry.
It's payment for the last shipment.
Plus the cancellation fee, plus the restocking fee plus something we call a coward's charge.
And that comes to $10,000.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I'll write you a check.
Is gratuity included?
Charles, no.
- Angela - Yes?
How can I - heal you today?
- Please stop saying that.
Look, you seem like a perfectly pleasant robot person, but there's no way we're giving you any more money.
Ohh.
Sorry for the misunderstanding.
For the no payment option, you just need to sign here.
"Enrollment in NutriCore"?
It's our charity organization.
"Pay off your contracts in labor hours under the teachings of founder Docter David Stovelman".
"Docter" is spelled with an E?
- It's the British spelling.
- That can't be right.
All right, look.
I didn't wanna have to do this, but we're in the NYPD.
And if you don't cooperate, we'll have no choice but to file a report against the company.
You signed a contract, and that is binding.
No one gets special treatment, Officer.
- Not even Jay.
- Who?
Jay Chandrasekhar, their celebrity spokesman.
Oh, no way.
The guy from "Super Troopers"?
Yep.
He was also in "Beerfest".
Now I have to get back to work, but allow me to introduce you to our complaint specialist.
This is Phil.
He's been assigned to intimidate you.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!
Charles, stop thanking her.
Hello, squad.
I am Sergeant Amy Santiago and I'm your new commanding officer.
I have big plans for us, but it's always best to start with something small and do it perfectly.
So Sergeant, I know what we should start with.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Officer - Jennings.
Gary Jennings.
Officer Jennings, I already have a plan.
Okay, well, you just paused, so I thought you were looking for suggestions, - which I have a lot of.
- Nope.
Not why I paused.
Anyway, our first order of business will be updating the filing system, so - We should use barcodes.
- No, no, no, no.
No need to jump in.
I already have a system in mind.
Okay, well you just keep stopping, - so I thought - Ah to pour water.
- Because I'm thirsty.
- Got it.
Great.
Now, let's get into the details of this with Oh, my God!
What, Gary?
You're spilling water everywhere.
Yes, I am.
Because our first order of business is cleaning this floor.
Charles!
Charles, come here.
I figured out how to get our money back.
I knew you'd save our honeymoon.
- My honeymoon.
- Whatever.
Yeah, all right, so NutriBoom is a massive financial scam, right?
If we can prove that, we could take down the whole company.
Oh, I don't know.
Are you sure you wanna take them on?
They're pretty scary.
I mean, no one's seen the CEO's wife in years.
People think she's been murdered.
That's just a rumor.
All right, here's the plan: we infiltrate their headquarters and get their financial records.
But how do we get in, you ask?
By attending today's meeting of President's Club Admiral Level NutriMasters - at the NutriTower Life Base.
- I don't know, they know we're cops, we can't just walk in.
Correct.
We can't walk right in, but we know someone who's a high-level NutriBoom distributor who can.
And he look exactly like you.
- Hey, guys.
- I don't know.
You really think it'll work?
Charles, it has to.
It's for our honeymoon.
You said "our".
Okay, the meeting at NutriBoom HQ starts in two hours.
Charles, you're going as Bill and I'm going as one of your NutriCruits.
Bill, did you bring those things I asked for?
Yep, all of my belongings that you'll need are in this suitcase.
Why is it vibrating?
Is your cell phone in here?
- No.
- I'm sure it's not a sex toy.
All right, these people really know Bill, so you're gonna have to become him.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Bill, tell us all about yourself.
Let's start with my whole family history.
I was abandoned at a playground as an infant.
And here I am.
Oh.
That was the whole thing.
Well, sad.
But easier than remembering a bunch of names.
Okay, tell us more.
Now, here's a list of all the nicknames I go by.
Big Bill, Big Eric, Big Drew, Big Dave, Super Thick Just write them all down for us.
And that's why the number of belly buttons I have is - Two.
- One.
- Zero.
- Ahh.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
That's it.
Okay, now let's work on your wink.
Almost.
Now think, only you and I know our naughty little secret.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, I think Boyle's ready.
That's a no-go, Amigo.
If you really wanna pass as me, you're gonna need to learn my patented neck massage technique.
I think I've learned enough.
Yeah, I don't really see that coming up.
Thanks for your help, Bill.
So how did your first briefing go, Sergeant?
Did you give the squad a simple goal?
Mm-hmm.
Revamping the filing system.
Mm, smart.
Sounds very easy.
- Mm.
- I assume it's been a success?
Oh Yes.
It's been all types of successes.
Rousing, resounding smashing.
Oh, it's good to hear.
Remember, failure is for failures.
Good thing I'm not a failure.
Guys, I lied.
My briefing was a total failure.
But you told Captain Holt it went great in such a normal way.
I'm a terrible manager.
I've got this super eager know-it-all on my squad who keeps derailing me with all his ideas and I can't get anything done.
Aww, you got an Amy.
- Oh, she's got an Amy.
- It's pretty normal.
Yeah, she got one of her, right?
Like a pet.
Takes one to know one, - I guess.
- No, he is not an Amy.
I am nothing like Gary.
Uhh, first of all, Gary and Amy - are the exact same name.
- Let me ask you this: did he already send you nine follow-up emails - about the briefing?
- No.
- It was 30.
- You got an Amy.
Guys, I think I would know if my Gary was an Amy.
- Hey, Gary.
What you reading?
- The new issue of "Stationary Monthly".
Yeah, I have an Amy.
Bill.
Is that you?
Yes, it's me, Bill.
Hello.
- You seem different.
- Nope.
I'm still the same old Bill Hummertrout who grew up in Bean Station, Tennessee and shaves his armpits.
Anyway, meet the new recruit I signed up.
New NutriCruit?
Boom, boom!
Boom, boom.
My name is Barry St. Barry.
And I can't wait to get inside and unlock my NutriFuture.
Let me let me in!
Let me in!
I love your energy.
Boom, boom!
I love your energy.
Boom, boom!
Okay, get up there.
Man, everybody here is so creepy.
Yeah.
Is that Hitchcock and Scully?
- Boom, boom, Bill!
- Boom, boom!
Yeah, that tracks.
All right, let's get a move on.
The longer I stay here, the more horrified I get.
I know.
Have you seen all these posters of David Stovelman's wife, Debby?
"I'm happy healthy and alive".
- Oh, Debbie dead.
- Debbie real dead.
All right, Bill said that the offices are behind that roped-off area.
We're gonna need a distraction.
Well, if I know cults, this meeting will start with an insanely over-the-top nonsense video.
- Huh.
- Hello, Admirals.
Please turn your eyes to the monitors for a special hello from NutriBoom elite, Jay Chandrasekhar.
Boom, boom, everybody!
Boom, boom, Jay!
- And there's our distraction.
- When I first met Docter David Stovelman, I had no idea my amino acids could be so high or so low.
Ugh, guys.
Gary is killing my productivity.
Terry, how did you used to deal with having an Amy?
I didn't have to do anything.
You've always been great.
Cut the crap, Terry.
I'm drowning.
Fine.
When you got too difficult to deal with, I'd pull rank.
- Did that work?
- No.
Not even once.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
Well, you could always just wait for Gary to find his Jake and then eventually, over time, they'll each become 10% easier to deal with.
Gary will never find love.
He is unlovable.
- Gina, what do I do?
- No, I don't know how to deal with an Amy.
But there is this girl Wanda in my Mommy & Me class.
She's such a pill.
She's so into her baby and not into the other babies and it's like, oh, cool, well, congrats.
Your baby rolled over early.
- Like, who cares?
- I don't have time - for this, Gina.
- And that is how you deal with an Amy.
You talk about something she's not interested in - until she walks away.
- Ohh, brilliant.
Stupid cult.
They labeled their financial records "financial records".
Dummies.
Uh-oh, Jake.
We got a NutriBoomer approaching at 12:00.
The file just started downloading.
- How much time do we have?
- I don't know, - but he's a polka dotter.
- Polka Dotter - what does that mean?
- Of the eight types of walkers?
Polka dotters, drivers, arm swingers, stompers you don't know about this?
Nobody does, Charles.
You clearly just read some weird blog post.
First of all, Popmango.com is not a weird blog.
It's infotainment.
Secondly, polka dot walkers take short strides on their toes.
I don't wanna learn about polka dotters right now.
Just get out there and stall him.
But gah!
Hello, bud.
Boom, boom.
Boom, boom.
Bill.
What are you doing back here?
This floor's closed on the weekend.
You know me, just gotta stretch my legs.
I'm really sore from Pilates.
But NutriBoom doesn't allow Pilates.
It's a pseudoscience.
Right, no.
Pilates is the name of my most recent sexual partner.
Boom, boom!
Boom, boom.
You seem off, man.
Your voice is different, you're not sucking on - your signature lollipop.
- Right.
I guess I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
Since when do you sleep in a bed?
Why are you being so weird?
What are you doing back here?
I know what's going on.
You're fishing for one of my patented neck massages, aren't you?
- There's the Bill I know.
- Present and accounted for.
Now turn around and gimme me that neck.
You're not gonna do it from the front?
Well, of course.
I mean, that's how I do it.
Oh, that's the good stuff.
Boom, boom.
Boom, boom.
Hey, where's my eye contact?
I got the files.
I told you it would work.
- Wait, what's wrong?
- They formed a line, Jake.
They formed a line.
Ugh No evidence of wrong doing in any of these files.
Credit where credit is due, NutriBoom is good at criminal activity.
Well, they're terrible at making shakes.
Right?
The only listed ingredient is "foreign substance".
And the flavor is called "Almost Cherry".
And I can't stop drinking it.
This is interesting.
There's a major transaction - on June 10th.
- My dad's birthday!
You really think that's what I thought - was interesting about it?
- I don't know.
It's a payment for 100 grand to ScepterCore.
Isn't that one of those black ops security firms - that ex-SEALs worked for?
- Yes, it is.
- And on June 10th - My dad's birthday.
Are you just trying to get me to remember your dad's birthday now?
I mean, it wouldn't kill you to call.
We don't have time to talk about this.
Your dad's birthday is the same day that Debbie Stovelman went missing last year.
I bet the payment is a paper trail for the hit Stovelman took out on his wife.
This just became a murder case.
Maybe, but it's not enough to open an investigation.
Right, but it is enough to make Stovelman nervous.
- We just have to get to him.
- Oh, no.
Do I have to go as Bill again?
No, don't worry.
He isn't big enough to earn face time with the founder.
We have to take this to the highest level.
Jay Chandrasekhar!
Hey, Gina.
Thanks for nothin'!
- Oh, you're welcome.
- I said, for nothin'.
Your boring story didn't work.
So my friend Wanda, she just loves the oceans.
The Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian Ooh, ooh!
What is her take on straits?
Because I love the Bering.
We talked about bodies of water for hours.
Damn, the Force is strong with this Amy.
Look, I wasn't gonna tell you this, but you should just do what I used to do - when I needed to escape you.
- What did you do?
Literally escape you.
Always be on the move.
Never be static.
Like a shark.
That way he can't catch your attention.
That's right!
That is what we did.
- But you all did that?
- Mm-hmm.
Okay, but Rosa, how did you Rosa?
W-where did she Damn, you guys are good.
There he is.
How did you know he'd be at this coffee shop?
"US Weekly".
He's pictured here all the time.
He's coming out.
All right, look, this guy is into NutriBoom pretty deep.
But if we apply enough pressure, we may get him to crack.
Copy that.
Hi, excuse me.
Mr. Chandrasekhar, we wanted to talk to you - about NutriBoom.
- All right!
- Boom, boom, guys.
- Boom, boom!
- We're with the NYPD.
- Oh, my God.
Seriously?
You guys have to save me.
- Can you get me out?
- What's that now?
NutriBoom is a scam and a cult.
- They've ruined my life.
- Really?
You look so happy in the videos.
You'd pretend to be happy too if you knew what they did to me.
- Testicular torture?
- Yeah.
- Ohh.
- Look, we have reason to believe David Stovelman murdered his wife, Debbie.
- Yeah, duh!
- All right, Jay.
- Try to remain calm, here.
- Sorry.
- I'm just so scarred.
- Right, from the nard torture.
Look, we have evidence that could tie David to his wife's death, but we need your help - to get to him.
- Yeah, I'll do whatever you want.
You have no idea how terrible they are.
Trust me, I do.
They took ten grand from me.
Boo-hoo, they kidnapped my dog.
Okay, well, no need to compare stakes.
Although I doubt your dog cost $10,000.
You can't put a price on life.
You're absolutely right.
Thank you so much for your help, sir.
- Sergeant?
- Aah!
I need to tell you something.
Great.
Can't wait to hear it.
First, could you pass that thing over there?
Sure, yes.
Oh, what thing?
I don't Sergeant?
- Sergeant!
- Oh, hey.
Sergeant?
Sergeant?
Okay.
Let's finally get these shelves up.
Goes perfect.
Ohh!
Oh, no.
Oh, there you are.
I was trying to tell you not to use that wall.
It has water damage.
Noted.
So Stovelman will pick up Jay and take him to lunch.
We trail them, and then when they get comfortable, ambush 'em with the intel about his wife.
Wow.
I can't believe we're working a sting operation - with a celebrity.
- I know.
I feel like we're in "Oceans 11".
You're such a Clooney.
- Ooh, and I'm Elliot Gould.
- Wow.
Just skipped right over Pitt and Damon, huh?
- I've been good!
- Oh, no!
- Those are NutriCore guys.
- They're taking Jay!
It's not a pick up.
It's a throw in.
- Where's Jay?
- Hey, Bill.
- Boom, boom!
- No boom, boom.
- I am not Bill.
- Look, we're with the NYPD.
We saw two NutriCore thugs kidnap Jay and bring him here.
- Now where is he?
- Bill, you're a cop!
- No, I am not Bill!
- If you don't cooperate, we'll consider you an accessory to this crime.
I don't know what you mean by crime.
Jay's just voluntarily hanging out with some nutrition specialists in the basement.
You can see for yourself if you'd like, Bill.
I will see for myself, but I am not Bill.
- Good one, Bill.
- Oh!
Get out of here.
- Jay!
Oh, my God.
- Boom, boom, guys!
What?
We saw them take you.
Are you okay?
What are you talking about?
- Oh, the van thing?
- Yeah, Jay.
The van thing.
Those are just my friends from NutriBoom.
They were worried about my amino acid levels, so they rushed me straight here to give me more or less of them.
Why are you talking like that?
What did they do to you?
Oh, I see.
They gave you back your dog.
No, they found my dog.
He was wandering around a park for a year.
Come on, man.
Pull it together.
These people are evil, remember?
David Stovelman murdered his wife.
You mean me?
- Debbie Stovelman.
- Boom, boom.
She is happy, healthy and alive.
Hey, Captain.
Just wanted to say sorry about the hole in the wall.
I've already called maintenance.
- Okay.
Anything else?
- God, you're good.
You saw right through me.
I failed as a manager.
I couldn't deal with this overeager officer who kept pestering me.
- Ohh, you have an - Amy.
Yes, I know.
We've been through it a lot today.
Well, you should've come to me.
I know exactly what it's like to be you.
You used to be an Amy?
No, I never had your level of insecurity.
I was referring to managing an Amy.
Of course.
Well, I'm not sure there's anything left to try.
No matter what I did, he just kept interrupting me with all his own ideas.
- Were they good ideas?
- I don't know.
I didn't listen to them.
Damn.
Did you just solve it that easily?
Yes, I did.
You see, managing Amy is not a chore, it's a pleasure.
- Because an Amy is a tool.
- I'm a tool?
Yes, you're a massive tool.
You're useful and valuable.
Sure, an Amy can be intimidating sometimes because they have such strong ideas.
But you should always listen to an Amy because they will only make you better.
At least, that's my experience.
Thank you, sir.
Jay, would you please excuse us.
I believe there's a brand new motorcycle with your name on it upstairs.
You guys are the best.
Thanks for bringing my dog back.
He looks almost exactly the same.
- Come on.
- Boom, boom, Jake.
- Boom, boom, Charles.
- Boom, boom, Jay.
What's going on here?
- I thought you were murdered.
- I was never dead.
Then what was that 100k payment to ScepterCore for?
It was to get you off the grid.
Because the Feds were investigating you.
You can't indict someone who doesn't exist.
So you're still working for NutriBoom?
Working for?
I am NutriBoom.
Look, your annoying little crusade is wasting my time.
I want you to leave me and my company alone.
Not gonna happen.
Now we know you're alive and I bet the Feds would be interested - in knowing that, too.
- Maybe, but the fact remains, I haven't committed any crimes that anyone can prove.
So you can try your luck with the Feds.
Or you can get your money back and go on that expensive honeymoon.
How do you know about my honeymoon?
- I know everything.
- Oh, really?
Because you don't know about my big ass moral compass.
Damn!
I'm going to the Feds, and you're going down.
Also, can you tell us how to get out of here?
This place is a real maze.
Oh, Officer Jennings?
Can I speak to you for a minute?
Of course.
Nothing I like more than one-on-one time with my boss.
Wow, it's like staring in a mirror.
- What?
- Nothing.
Listen, I wanna apologize.
I ignored your ideas and that was a mistake.
Please, tell me your suggestions - for the filing system.
- It's actually five suggestions and 23 sub suggestions.
- And I - After the briefing.
Ohh.
Copy that.
All right, listen up, squad.
We had increased criminal activity in the park last night, so we'll be doubling our patrols there today.
After the meeting, I will be handing out new assignments.
Oh, my God, I did it.
The Feds said our intel could help them maybe take down Stovelman someday, - but they didn't sound hopeful.
- Well, I'm glad - you did the right thing.
- Really?
Even though it means we now have no money - for a decent honeymoon?
- It's hard not to say a really corny thing right now about how every day's a honeymoon with you.
Aww.
Although, technically, you did you just say it.
Which is very embarrassing for you.
Jake, don't freak out.
There's a really creepy guy spying on us.
Oh, no, no, no.
That's just Phil from NutraBoom.
He'll be intimidating us from now on.
There's an evil corporation hell-bent on destroying us.
Hi, Phil!
Boom, boom!
Say, "Boom, boom," darling.
Boom, boom.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
1 So, do you recognize any of these men?
I was hiding in the bathroom stall, so I didn't see his face.
But I heard him.
He was singing along to the music at the bar.
Do you remember what he was singing?
I think it was that song, "I Want It That Way".
Backstreet Boys.
I'm familiar.
Okay.
Number one, could you please sing the opening to "I Want It That Way"?
Really?
Okay.
You are My fire Number two, keep it going.
The one desire - Number three.
- Believe When I say Number four.
I want it that way Tell me why!
Ain't nothing but a heartache Tell me why!
Ain't nothing but a mistake Now number five I never want to hear you say - Whoo!
- I want it that way Ah, chills!
Literal chills.
It was number five.
Number five killed my brother.
Oh, my God, I forgot about that part.
Hey, it's time.
You ready?
You excited?
Yes, I can't believe it's finally gonna happen.
Aw, you guys are gonna have sex for the first time.
I'll have you know Amy and I do sex 24-sevs, 369.
Oh no, I grossly overcompensated and now it seems like we have problems.
- You done?
- Mm-hmm.
Great.
Jake's sister is flying in from Dallas, and we're picking her up at the airport.
- You have a sister?
- Half-sister.
Turns out that my slutty pilot dad made daughters is several major airline hubs.
ATL and EWR didn't respond when I reached out, but DFW is DTM.
Down to meet.
Well, we should get going.
Her flight's gonna land soon, but wish me luck.
I'm about to be a brother.
Captain Holt, I need a what's going on?
My doctor said I should be more active, but my squash club recently transitioned to racquetball.
Since I'm not a dope-smoking hooligan, I decided to quit.
Boyle is teaching me yoga.
Genevieve got me into it.
You can't believe how many different ways I can wrap my legs around her.
Six!
Captain, if you wanted to be healthier, why not come to me?
I'm ripped as hell.
Sarge, health is about flexibility and peace of mind and bone strength, not building vanity muscles.
Vanity muscles?
I use all of these.
Really?
Even the large neck ones?
They help me sleep upright on airplanes!
Well, there's no reason to be defensive, just because you don't have the bone strength of a yogi.
We all have our thing.
You're a muscler, I'm a boner.
Terry can do yoga.
Terry is a yoga beast.
Watch.
Give me a yoga to do.
Ah, well, we're in warrior pose now, but I suppose for you we can start in child's pose.
Terry is not a child!
Terry is a warrior.
And That didn't sound good.
Are you okay, Jeffords?
I'm fine.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to walk out of here normally using my trademark tiny steps.
Okay?
What you looking at?
Did the Kanye West cannibalism story finally break?
- What?
Is that a thing?
- Yeah.
He eats tiny little bites of people when he hugs them goodbye.
I tipped off Page Six, I don't know why they're sitting on it.
Just looking on a dating app.
Weird.
Lame.
Gross.
Dumb.
Freak.
Loser.
Perv.
Toothy.
Mouthy.
- Well, what happened to Becky?
- Who?
The girl you were seeing whose name you wouldn't tell us so we just started calling her Becky.
Becky and I broke up.
She ate soup too much.
- What, like every day?
- It happened twice.
Okay, well, listen, you're in luck.
Because I have the perfect girl for you, and I'm actually texting with her right now.
No.
You are terrible at setting me up.
Remember that dork, Justin?
He was a tattoo artist, - and he rode a motorcycle.
- A Yamaha.
He might as well have picked me up in a station wagon.
You know what, men are difficult because they're all secretly monsters, but now that I know you're bi, that changes everything.
I know so many great women.
I'm sorry.
I just don't think this is something you're good at.
What?
The only thing I'm not good at is modesty, because I'm great at it.
Okay, according to the flight board, she should be here any minute.
I love watching a "TBD" turn into a gate num.
What's wrong?
- Why do you look like that?
- I'm so nervous.
My hands are shaking and my butt is hella sweaty.
I totally understand.
I freaked out when I met my pen pal from Thailand, Mongkut.
But everything worked out, right?
You and Mongkut are lifelong friends now.
No, Mongkut turned out to be a 45-year-old prisoner.
It was a really awkward trip.
That sounds horrible.
Amy, what if this is a Mongkut situation?
Oh no, that pen pal service is shut down.
This is your sister.
It's gonna be great.
You just have to relax and be yourself.
But what if myself isn't good enough, you know?
What if I'm the Mongkut?
- Jake - Right.
You're right.
It's gonna be great.
Just got to stay positive.
We're gonna see each other from across the room, we'll lock eyes, I'll say "noice," she'll say "toit," and then six months later, we'll be on "The Amazing Race" together.
Jake?
Ka oh, no.
It's me, Kate.
Give me a hug.
- Stand down, ma'am.
- Back off, dude!
- That's my brother!
- Oh, no.
It's a Mongkut situation.
So, this is awkward, but we should probably address - the elephant in the room.
- Right.
Are we doing table apps or solo apps?
Uh, table apps and lots of them.
If it is fried, it must be tried.
- Johnny Cochran.
- I remember when he said that.
- Jake.
- Right.
So, what I actually meant was, we should probably talk about the whole handcuffs at the airport thing.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
That was a really bad first impression.
It's just, I was on the plane and started to get really nervous about meeting you for the first time.
I was nervous to meet you too.
My butt got hella sweaty.
- I told Amy.
You can ask her.
- Please don't.
So I went to the bathroom and started vaping to calm down.
Then this weird-ass lady comes up to me, and I'm like, bitch, you're trying to tell me your kid doesn't like the smell of cotton candy?
Right, but the only thing I don't get is why they would handcuff you for vaping.
Because they're the worst!
Yeah, Amy, 'cause they're the worst.
Also, I slapped a stewardess, real hard.
With my fist.
Oh.
So they were not the worst.
Oh, my God, are you mad at me?
Oh, no, I messed this up.
I am so sorry, Jake.
I really wanted this trip to go well and was looking forward to finally having a brother for the first time.
You know what, I'm just I think I'm just gonna leave.
No, don't leave, okay?
It's fine.
I get it.
It's so crazy that we're finally meeting each other.
So just forget about the plane.
That's ancient history.
- Really?
- Yes.
This trip was about us getting to know each other, - so let's do that.
- Okay.
What's your favorite scene in "Die Hard"?
Die what?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Um, when was the last time you saw your dad?
I mean, I've only ever met him like nine times.
Ten if you count the time he sent his co-pilot Steve to hang out with me, 'cause he was too hungover.
I remember Steve.
He taught me how to shave.
- He taught me how to shave.
- Where?
- Steve was the best.
- Freakin' Steve.
Jeffords, what are you still doing here?
You're clearly injured.
Go home.
I'm totally fine.
Here.
I can prove it.
I'm fine.
See?
You can't have thought that went well for you.
It's okay, Sarge.
Just admit you can't handle yoga.
I can handle it fine.
I'm just a little sore from my real workouts.
With weights.
Now, I've got work to do.
Oops.
Dropped my phone.
You know what?
My contract is up.
It's time for an upgrade anyway.
- Scully?
- Huh?
Where's your secret nap room?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Help me!
Please!
Couch.
Space heater.
We soundproof for maximum privacy.
And there's sodas and candy in the mini fridge.
- This room's a little small.
- We had a big nap room, and you gave it to Gina to pump breast milk in, remember?
!
Sorry, Scully.
You tell anyone about this place, I will burn your life to the ground.
Oh, and there's a spray if you fart.
Okay, that is nothing.
The one parent-teacher conference my dad went to, he had sex with my teacher on top of the diorama I made of the first Thanksgiving.
Oh, no, he ruined all your hard work.
Oh, not really, it was just a bunch of Smurfs on a plate.
- Oh.
- He came to visit once, and hooked up with my mom's entire book club.
She can't see a copy of "A Prayer For Owen Meany" without fully weeping.
I don't know what that is.
But enough about our dad.
- What's going on in your life?
- Honestly, it's been a tough year.
I lost my job, love of my life Kurt just broke up with me.
Oh, hey, Amy has seven brothers.
Maybe you could date one of them.
Oh, snap.
I'm down to clown.
Which one has the best body?
- Uhhh - Tony.
Right?
It's very clearly Tony.
I don't know why she hesitated.
- Tony got bod.
- Tony it is.
Anyway, that's my boring life in Dallas.
But I'm here now, and I want to see the real New York.
Let's like Walk across the Brooklyn Bridge?
Get tanked at the Times Square Olive Garden.
And get our pictures taken with a human statue.
Right.
The real New York.
- Whenever you're ready.
- Hey, let me get dinner.
I had like ten more drinks than you guys.
- Oh, are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.
Wow, that is so sweet, and totally unneces - what are you doing?
- Life hack.
Hey, there's glass in my food!
Oh, my God oh my God, oh my God oh my God What kind of restaurant is this?
!
Where's Holt?
He told me to come in here.
Nope.
That was me.
I've been recording his voice for the past two years, and now I have a soundboard where I can make him say anything I want.
Check it out.
Diaz.
I. Need.
To.
See.
You.
In.
The.
Briefing.
Room.
Now.
Pretty cool, right?
Watch this.
Milk.

Corner.
Fudge.

Made.
- That is amazing.
- Isn't it?
- What do you want?
- To find you love.
- Ugh.
- Come on!
Check it out: Dannika, 34.
- The only female trader - Pass.
Finance people are the worst.
Okay, well, take a gander at Jessica, professional stuntwoman just back from a surf trip in Bali Pass.
People who surf never shut up about it.
Kinda true.
You know who doesn't surf?
Gabrielle.
- I'm out.
- Come on, Rosa.
Give me a shot.
If I mess it up, fine.
I'll drop it, and I'll never bring it up again.
Fine.
One date.
That's all you get.
- That's all I need.
- Hey.
Diaz.
Enjoy.
Having.
Sexual.
Fun.
With.
Linetti's.
Lesbian.
Friend.
Get.
Some.
Get.
Some.
Get.
Some.
So, your sister's a bit of a nightmare.
I wouldn't say that.
I mean, at most, she's a daymare.
- Those are so much scarier.
- Yeah.
She put glass in her food, Jake.
She's a con-woman.
Look, she's a survivor.
She's had a really hard life.
And I thought it bad 'cause I would only see my dad for like an afternoon once a year, but compared to her, I was a real DJ Tanner.
"Full House".
- Her dad was always around.
- Yeah, I've seen "Full House".
Look, I'm sorry she's not what you expected.
She is a lot.
But she's my sister.
And she's young, and she just got out of a really bad breakup Whoo!
She's home.
Kate!
Are you okay?
Sounds like you're breaking stuff.
Hey!
I'm sorry, were we being too loud?
- We?
- Oh, hey.
I'm William.
I thought you just wanted a picture.
Oh, we took a lot of pictures.
Get in here!
- Oh, no, he's my brother.
- That doesn't bother me.
Okay, I'm going to bed.
Okay.
Time to go home.
Oh, no.
Terry can't move.
Terry needs help.
Hel Ugh, there are silver butt prints everywhere.
Why did he need to paint his butt?
He wears pants.
Look, I'm sorry about all this.
I really thought she was gonna be like me.
But scamming restaurants and hooking up with street performers, she is 100% my dad.
Look, it's a two-day trip.
We just need to survive the next 18 hours.
- Sure, sure.
- And, you know, I sat through a whole play once, so I can get through anything.
I took you to that play, and you said you loved it.
- Because I did.
- Well, 55 minutes in the shower and that silver paint - will not come off.
- Gross.
Anyway, my astrologer is always telling me everything happens for a reason, and I'm like, then why did Kurt dump me?
But now I know why.
So I would leave Dallas and move to New York to be near you!
Whoa, really?
I mean, that's great, but, you know, it's so expensive here.
I'll be fine.
I got a head full of dreams, and a pocket full of glass.
I'm a New Yorker now.
Fuggedabout it!
Yes.
Forget about it.
Babe.
What are we gonna do?
My sister cannot move here.
I'll just tell her it's a bad idea, and she shouldn't do it.
Ugh, but I'm the only family she has.
I don't want to hurt her feelings and send her into a downward spiral.
She slept with a tin man, Jake.
I don't think the spiral goes any further down.
Right.
Wait, I've got it.
The only reason Kate wants to move here is because Kurt dumped her, but what if we can get him to take her back?
Then she would definitely want to stay in Dallas!
Ooh, that's smart, but what if he's a rational person and he doesn't want to be with her anymore?
Not a problem.
I found his Facebook page.
He just posted a black and white photo of a dead flower with the hashtags "my heart," "Kate forever" and "love is dead".
- He misses her for some reason.
- Amy, this is it.
He clearly already wants to get back together.
All we have to do is convince him to fly here.
- Jake, this might work.
- Yes!
But are we actually gonna do this?
Are we really going to fly a man to New York City just to ensure that my new sister doesn't move here?
Hey, Amy, do you have a morning-after pill I could bomb?
I will get you back.
Use.
My.
Miles.
Boyle, have you seen Sergeant Jeffords?
Oh, do you mean Sore-gent Jeff-hurts?
He didn't make it home last night, Boyle.
- Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
- You should be.
He could be in grave danger, and you just flippantly called him Sore-gent.
Oh, my God.
I'm the worst.
Who does that?
Well, his car's still here, so I don't think he ever left the building.
- He's probably fine.
- What?
Then why did you make me feel so bad?
To teach you a lesson about about the destructive power of wordplay.
Now, where could he be?
Why are we going home?
We haven't even done the "Sex and the City" tour.
Oh, my gosh, I am such a "that one who fell through the sidewalk hole".
Yeah, you totally are.
We're just so excited you're moving here, we thought, why not go straight home and celebrate at exactly 8:00?
- Kate.
- Kurt?
- Kurt?
The Kurt?
- What?
!
Oh, my God, what are the chances?
Kate, you didn't tell us how handsome Kurt is.
I love your jean shorts.
Babe, breaking up with you was the biggest mistake of my life.
It was?
Oh, my God, he flew all the way to New York to tell me that.
That's so romantic.
It's beautiful, really.
You're not even allowed to leave the state.
- What's that now?
- One more time?
You think I'm gonna let my skank parole officer stand in the way of true love?
Kurt!
He seems like a cool guy.
Jeffords isn't in the evidence locker.
He's not in the file room, either.
I mean, there's nowhere left to hide.
I'm worried.
Actually, I think I know where he is.
I could take you there, but you need to wear blindfolds.
- No.
- Okay.
I guess he'll just die in Supply Closet F, then.
He's in Supply Closet F!
Great work.
I'm sorry.
I feel so stupid.
Oh, it's okay.
They tricked you somehow.
I still love you, buddy.
- Oh, thank God, you found me!
- Jeffords, are you okay?
Charles was right.
I couldn't handle yoga.
Well, we're here to help.
I'll get a couple officers to help lift you up.
No need.
I can handle this.
Charles, there's no way you can lift me.
Yoga's given me great bone strength, Terry.
So get ready you're about to enter the bone zone.
- Not a thing.
- Shhh.
Joe Cocker's "Up Where We Belong" Love lift us up where we belong Where the eagles cry On a mountain high Rosa, I want to introduce you to my friend Trishelle.
- Hi.
- Sparks.
Well, I'm gonna take off.
You two have fun.
Get.
Some.
I made a mobile version.
So, what are you drinking?
I'll have a margarita.
But, like, a skinny margarita.
So, like, tequila, lime, and a tiny splash of agave.
- Mm.
I refuse to order that.
- You don't have to.
I heard her.
What do you want?
Just take your cheapest whisky and pour it into your nearest glass.
- That's a drink.
- So, with this diet that I'm on, you can eat anything that's clear.
- Mm.
- Like rice noodles, pineapple gummi bears So Kurt and I talked, and I'm sorry, Jake, I know I said I'd stay in New York, but I can't give up on this guy.
Especially not after he flew out here for me.
Well, sounds like the universe just really wants you to be in Dallas.
But on a personal note, it is such a bummer.
I just missed her so much.
And so do the kids.
Oh, you have kids?
Kurt has six.
Who's watching them now?
- The state.
- Oh, fun.
We're getting to know Kurt.
Ooh, hey, sorry, the door was unlocked, so I opened it.
Is Kate here?
Oh, hey.
I think I left my wallet in your couch bed.
Uh, have you seen it?
- It's silver.
- Babe, who is this?
- Babe?
- That's William.
He is a human statue I know.
Yeah, it's not really a good time right now, William.
We don't have your wallet.
Bye.
Did you have sex with this silver man?
- Did you cheat on me?
- We were broken up.
And you cheated on me like ten times when we were dating.
'Cause you were sad all the time.
- 'Cause my mom died.
- Oh, no.
- In March.
- That's so recent.
Fine.
I'm sorry, Kurt.
I'm sorry.
What?
No, don't apologize to this guy.
- He's a dick.
- Excuse me?
You're not good enough for my sister.
I didn't realize you were this tall.
Kurt.
She's not going anywhere with you.
Take your jean shorts and the butt that's in them and get out of my apartment.
What the hell, man?
You're the one who flew me out here and begged me to bring her back to Dallas.
- Just - Kate!
Tsk.
You begged him to get rid of me?
Uh Hey!
Found my wallet.
Thanks, guys.
Have a blessed day.
So he was a robot man.
So you were trying to get rid of me?
I mean Yeah, kinda.
But I also just told off Kurt for being a jerk to you, so who's to say which thing we should focus on?
Anyways, let's go to Olive Garden and get tanked.
No, I won't, because that place is for family.
Ah, that stings.
Look, we're still family.
I just didn't think you should be moving to New York.
The whole plan seemed a little how do I put this delicately psychotic.
I didn't ask you to be a part of my life, Jake.
You asked me.
I was perfectly happy in Dallas with no dad and a dead mom, being walked all over by Kurt and his kids.
That doesn't sound like a great situation.
Yeah, it's bad, okay?
!
Which is why when I got a call out of the blue that I had a brother who wanted to meet me, I got a little excited.
I'm so sorry.
I was excited too, but we don't know each other.
You shouldn't move here just for me.
Don't worry.
I'm going back to Dallas.
You won't ever have to see me again.
Until, that is, I'm on "The Voice," at point, you'll see me Everywhere!
- Oh.
- Oh you don't like my singing?
Well, good, because that is the last time you get it, For freeeeeeee!
She's gonna do bad on "The Voice".
So, how'd it go last night?
- Worst date I've ever been on.
- Oh, no, that sucks.
Then why are you coming in to work so late?
It's almost like you spent the night somewhere.
I don't know, like, maybe the bartender's?
Wait, what?
How do you know that?
Because Aubrey is my friend, and she was the real set-up all along.
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, I knew you'd reject whoever I put in front of you.
I mean, Trishelle was just a decoy.
And you fell for it hook, line, and skinny margarita.
Nicely done.
Aubrey is great.
We're going to dinner again tonight.
- Whoo!
- I owe you an apology.
You're a great matchmaker.
Thank you.
And you know what?
I'm just glad that you found the courage to tell me how great I am.
It means so much.
- Whatever.
- Have a fun night.
This is not on us.
I mean, it was crazy for her to think moving to New York was a good idea, right?
Yes, it was unrealistic.
Just like Mongkut thinking a ten-year-old American girl would pay his bail and help him seek vengeance on his brother.
You know, when I'm not distracted by this, I'd really love to hear the full Mongkut story.
- It gets dark.
- Yup.
Look, your sister is a lot to take.
You shouldn't feel bad that you don't want her around constantly.
Right?
I mean, we can have a relationship and still live in separate cities.
I'd love to see her, like, once a year for an afternoon, or - Oh, crap.
- What?
Oh, something just dawned on you.
Yeah, I got to go to the airport.
This is ridiculous.
Listen, the choice is yours.
Lawsuit, or upgrade me to business class.
- Ball's in your court, pal!
- Hey!
Kate, officers, what's going on here?
This woman said she cut her hand on a ticketing kiosk, but somebody saw her pull out a bag of glass.
That's my healing glass, and legally, you can't ask about it.
What kind of airport is this?
Okay, I'm with the NYPD.
I got it from here.
Thanks, guys.
- What do you want?
- To apologize.
Look, I was trying to get rid of you.
Because you're a little bit of a mess, kinda like dad.
- Oh, I'm definitely a mess.
- But I was being like dad too.
I was trying to have a relationship with you, completely on my own terms.
And we both know from personal experience, that's a really crappy way to treat a family member.
It is.
Thank you for saying that, Jake.
And yes, I accept your invitation to move in with you.
- Oh.
Um - I'm joking.
I'm going back to Dallas.
Don't worry.
But maybe we can keep in touch.
I would really like that.
Man, I was worried you were never gonna want to see me again.
Are you kidding?
The way you stood up for me with Kurt, you're a great big brother.
And I have so many other enemies.
- You're gonna be real busy.
- Oh.
Anyway, I should go.
My plane's leaving.
Come here.
- Noice.
- Toit.
All right, sis, have a safe flight.
- No vaping.
- No promises!
She is bad at singing.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
1 Hey, Charles, want to grab a beer before you go home?
- Ooh, a yeast feast.
- Never mind.
No, no, no, I want to go, it's just, there's a huge emergency I have to deal with first.
Oh, no.
Is everything okay?
It's about my food truck.
I have to get a parking spot.
Oh.
That doesn't sound as intense as you were making it out to be.
- Move your ass, you old bitch!
- What is happening?
We have to get there by 7:00 when they lift the parking restrictions.
It's the best spot in Brooklyn, and everyone wants it.
Get the hell out of the way!
Charles, I highly doubt the entire food truck industry is racing to get into this one spot.
It's not "Mad Max".
We're neck and neck with rice pudding.
You got Korean tacos on your six.
Oh, my God, it's real.
We're on the Fury Road.
Witness me, blood bag!
Hold on tight!
That was the most stressful thing I've ever gone through, and I was wrongfully imprisoned last year.
That was fun.
Every aspect of owning a food truck is fun.
It is fun, fun, fun.
What the hell do you want, Troy?
You stole my spot, you son of a bitch!
Oh, go on, get out of here.
- You're just jealous.
- I'm not going anywhere!
I made a signal, - and you made an illegal U-turn!
- Give me a break.
- I should call the cops!
- Oh, are you gonna - call the cops?
- Yeah, I'm gonna call the cops!
- I am the cops!
- Oh, you're a cop now?
Why don't you go back to your garbage truck and cook some pudding?
You're gonna regret this.
Kill yourself, Troy!
Jake, I have a confession to make.
The food truck is kind of stressing me out.
Bad news, Captain.
A water main burst downtown.
- There's been several injuries.
- Oh, that's unfortunate.
And the victims are in our blah-blah-blah, but tell him the real tragedy, Terry.
Olivia Crawford AKA your main commish competish.
Tweeted a statement addressing the water main break, and she's been retweeted by the mayor.
"Kudos to our brave officers" - Hey, now.
- Whoa!
What is going on?
It's in all caps.
Anyway, I don't see how this is bad news.
Because the commissioner race, like all of life, is a popularity contest, and Olivia is sitting at the hot senior table whilst you are eating lunch alone.
If the mayor wants to make me the next NYPD commissioner, it'll be because of my record and my qualifications, not my social media presence.
- This is a serious job.
- I know.
But like it or not, the decision is political, and social media is a part of politics now.
- You need a Twitter account.
- Not gonna happen.
The whole thing is inane.
Besides, 140 characters is far more than anyone needs to make a point.
They actually upped it to 280.
Oh, good God.
I'm so miserable, Jake.
The truck is hemorrhaging money.
I'm going bankrupt.
- I never see my family.
- All right, look.
You just have to find a way to reduce expenses.
I've started saving $200 a month just by buying "John Wick" instead of renting it every two nights.
I have cut costs.
I fired my only employee, Ted, which was awful.
Okay, look, I hate to ask this, but have you considered shutting the truck down?
You're always bragging about how much Boyles love to give up.
I can't.
I'm in so much debt.
I took out a loan for the truck.
I got Amy to invest.
No, the only way out of this hole is to keep digging.
That's not how holes work title of your sex tape Charles, look, you're gonna find your way out of this, I swear.
- It's all gonna work out.
- You're right.
You know, if I just work hard and stay positive, I'm sure it'll be a huge success and everything will be okay.
There you go.
Hello?
Oh.
Okay.
No, thank you.
So my truck burned down.
Hey.
Someone robbed a bodega on 4th Street.
It's the fifth one this week.
It's so sad that someone's targeting bodegas.
They're part of the fabric of New York.
- You shop at them a lot?
- No.
They overcharge for everything, and they sell rat poison right next to the bananas.
Yeah, they're gross.
I hope they never change.
Anyway, Holt wants us to interview some of the bodega owners and figure out where to assign additional uniformed officers.
I put a map up on the server No!
Just email it to me.
I hate servers.
Bye!
Wait.
Why'd you close your laptop so fast?
- What are you hiding?
- Nurthing.
- You're hiding something.
- What?
- Just 'cause I said "nurthing"?
- Yes.
No!
Aww, you're looking at wedding dresses?
- That one's dope.
- That's not what I was doing.
My computer must've gone to this site on its own.
- How is that possible?
- It's broken, Y2K.
I'll fix it.
There, it's fixed.
- You're weird.
- I know.
Oh, God.
My truck.
This truck was my baby!
All right, look, Charles, I know you're upset, but maybe there's a silver lining here.
- I mean, you had insurance, right?
- Yeah.
I already called them.
So maybe you'll get some money for this, and you can pay off your debts, starting with Amy.
I'm sorry, that was selfish.
Forget I said it.
You can pay off your debts, starting with Amy.
Whoops, I did it again.
You're right.
This is my way out.
It's a miracle.
Oh, my God!
Jake?
Boyle?
Adrian.
What are you doing here?
I'm an insurance investigator now.
I thought you were in Alaska.
Oh, yeah, I was, after Rosa and I broke up, but then I accidentally killed a "protected buffalo" self-defense.
Next thing I know, Fish and Game are all over my ass.
I ended up in a fight with a bear, and I had to think to myself, why am I even here?
Wait a minute.
You fought a bear?
Big time.
The trick on that: head-butt him in the penis, push him over a cliff.
Ah, I bet that works with a lot of animals.
Only the male ones.
- Learned that the hard way.
- Hmm.
Anyway, you know that if you guys want to get in touch with me, there's easier ways than burning down your truck, right?
What?
Burning down my truck?
Yeah, it's obviously arson, you did it, you're not gonna get a dime and are probably gonna go to jail.
So what's going on with you guys?
Give me that juicy Nine-Nine goss, am I right?
This is insane.
I mean, Charles loved this truck.
It's his baby.
There's no way he'd burn it down.
The world is a messed up place, Jake.
People kill their babies.
Babies kill their parents.
It's the circle of life.
- That was clearly a triangle.
- Okay, fine, busted.
I just had the stove's gas line cleaned.
Maybe it was put back in wrong or something.
Look, I've caught enough arsonists in my day to know that the owner always does it.
Chuck, how's the truck been doing?
- Pretty terrible.
- Hmm?
I was just saying, it's a miracle it burned down.
Okay, I know Charles sounds hella guilty right now, but you know he didn't do it.
Charles, this isn't looking good for you.
Anybody else that might have done this?
Any enemies?
Well, my dad's best friend and I have a pretty intense rivalry, but I don't think my aunt would do anything illegal.
Oh, my God.
Wait.
The rice pudding truck guy!
Oh, my God.
That bastard Troy.
We just got into a fight about this very parking spot.
- He said I'd regret it.
- Yeah, and that's what happened.
You're regretting it!
Come on, you know we didn't commit arson.
- Adrian, this is us.
- Not the TV show.
- We are your friends.
- Not the movie.
- You got to have faith.
- Not the song.
Are you doing this on purpose?
- The third one, yes.
- Okay.
I'll admit, arson does seem out of character for you.
Okay, look me in the eyes.
Look me in the eyes like the bear did.
Okay.
I believe you, and together, we're gonna catch the SOB that did this.
I'm so glad he didn't head-butt me in the penis.
That's all I was thinking about.
Cheddar!
- That's a really good job.
- Stay, stay.
What's going on here?
Why is Cheddar here?
And why is he in swim trunks?
Because the little sailor outfit - wouldn't fit his tush.
- Excuse me?
We're setting you up a Twitter account, and the fastest way to get followers is cute animal pics.
I follow an account that's just this one real grouchy chinchilla.
He hates waking up so much!
He really does.
He's like "Ooh"!
This is ridiculous.
This has nothing to do with police work.
Exactly.
It's about being noticed, and right now, no one is noticing you.
I didn't even realize we were talking to a third party, presently.
Fine.
If you really think it's necessary, I will establish a social media presence.
But I'll be setting up my own accounts, and I assure you, I won't be resorting to foolish gimmicks involving my dog.
Uh, you might want to rethink that stance, because how cute would Cheddar look in this hat?
Please.
When it comes to clothes, Cheddar wears little booties in the snow, or Cheddar wears nothing.
Troy's not home, but I say we wait.
I have some hard questions for that rice pudding bastard.
So, Adrian, how's life as an insurance investigator?
It's amazing.
At Gray Star Mutual, they let me do whatever I want, as long as I'm getting that job done, and you know I am.
Last week, I waterboarded a dude.
- Oh, that's not legal.
- Doesn't matter.
I'm not a cop.
Anyway, what's up with you guys?
Hey, Jake, who you porking?
Uh, I guess Amy and I are still - I don't want to say it.
- Yep.
- Porking.
- Yeah, you are.
Nice.
Actually, we got engaged.
What the hell?
How come I didn't know?
I thought we were supposed to be friends.
Oh, wait a minute.
Did this, like, just happen?
Well, it was at Halloween.
Wha no, that's so long ago!
Charles, are you just finding out about this too?
No, I was there.
You were there?
Who else?
Who else got to be a part of this?
Nobody, you know, just Holt and - Terry and Rosa.
- Okay.
- And Hitchcock and Scully.
- Seriously?
And this creepy guy named Bill.
Oh, come on!
I'm the creepy guy that's supposed to be at stuff that you have happen.
Look, you just left town, and we don't exactly have a text relationship How dare you?
May 10th, I texted you, I'm at the Gaga concert, you here, question mark, question mark, question mark.
You texted back, No.
Frowny face.
Look, I've been really busy.
I'm sorry, okay?
I understand.
You know, I just didn't hear about this one thing.
I mean, I can't imagine there are any other major milestones that I've missed.
- Are there?
- I mean, Amy's a sergeant.
- No.
- And Holt's up - for commissioner.
- Seriously?
And Dr. Ronald Yee came to the precinct and taught a course on forensics.
The Dr. Ronald Yee?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God!
- Yee was in the building?
- Yeah.
Wow, didn't realize the Yee news was up there - with the other stuff.
- Oh, come on, Jake.
Yee only wrote the book on forensic facial reconstruction.
He's a rock star!
You guys could have texted me, but no, because I bet you haven't thought about me once since I dumped Rosa.
- Did you dump her?
- You know what?
I need some air.
I'm storming out.
I'm storming out!
So I can spare four uniformed officers to do hourly pass-bys of the bodegas south of 4th, and I'll coordinate with the, um hourly pass-bys of the Wait.
What was that?
That was me talking about hourly pass-bys.
Oh, yeah, I heard about the hourly pass-bys.
Twice.
I meant - That subtle side look.
-  There was no subtle side look.
You're right, 'cause it wasn't subtle.
It was an unsubtle side look at that dress in the shop.
Why are you being such a nutjob about looking for a wedding dress?
Because being a female sergeant is difficult.
I have to work twice as hard to gain my officers' respect, and looking at girly dresses isn't going to help.
Plus, it's a new job, and I need to make it a priority.
Dude, I get that, but if you want a beautiful wedding dress, you deserve to find one.
Look, there are no cops around.
Nobody's gonna see you.
Why don't we just take our break now, try one on?
- Okay?
-  Okay.
- Okay?
- Okay.
- Okay?
-  Okay.
Hell yeah!
They are closed.
- We will come back later.
- Yeah.
Where did Adrian go?
He seemed upset.
- Should we be worried?
- Always.
We should always be worried about him.
Jake.
Look, look.
Excuse me, Troy Lunniker, we are I know exactly who you are, you spot-stealing - son of a bitch!
- I didn't steal your spot!
- You were too slow, you idiot!
- You did steal my spot, man.
You with the horrible meatballs.
You should call them crap balls, man!
Oh, my food tastes like crap?
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop.
- Crap balls.
- Hey!
Look, Detective Boyle's truck burned down.
Yeah, and you did it.
You torched my truck, and you're going to jail.
Whoa.
Someone burned down your truck?
I'm sorry, man, but I would never do anything like that.
I swear it wasn't me.
Well, I'd love to believe you, Troy, but I'm afraid we're gonna need to see some proof.
Oh, my God, he had so much proof.
I can't believe he was on "Cash Cab" at the exact moment my truck burned down.
And he did so well.
He named every member of The Monkees.
- He even got Tork.
- No one gets Tork.
I know.
All right, so if it wasn't Troy, the question is, who could it have been?
What's up, jerks?
Pimento, you broke into my house?
Yeah.
I'm an insurance investigator.
- I can do whatever I want.
- What are you doing here?
I'm working the case.
I'm looking for clues.
Come on, you already said Charles couldn't do this.
- I couldn't do it.
- That's what I thought.
But then I realized, if you can hide your engagement from me, what else are you capable of hiding?
Oh, right.
Arson!
Come on, don't you think that's a bit of a stretch?
Is it?
Lab tests came back and said the accelerant used in the fire was turpentine.
And look what I found in Boyle's wife's closet.
Looks to me a lot like turpentine.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that.
-  Turpentine, just like I thought.
That's Genevieve's.
She uses it for her paintings.
Oh, likely story.
If that's the case, then how do you explain this that I found on your fridge?
My wedding invitation?
Aha, so you admit it.
Invites have gone out, and I didn't get one!
Oh, well, well, well.
Now you both are gonna pay.
- Adrian.
- Hey, come on.
Oh, I thought you were reaching for a gun.
Oh, no, my friend.
This is much worse than a gun.
This is a stamp, a stamp that says Denied.
Your claim is denied.
Do you really think the insurance company will replace Adrian as the investigator on my case?
Yeah.
It's Gray Star Mutual "Where the feeling is mutual".
And right now we're feeling like we want a new investigator.
Hi, I'm Travis.
I've been reviewing your appeal.
I understand you have a problem with Mr. Pimento.
Yes, we sort of have a complicated preexisting relationship, which I think is a conflict of interest.
Okay, I'll be honest, we've had some problems with Mr. Pimento before.
I think he may have broken into my apartment once.
Oh, you'd know.
He leaves a lot of hair behind.
- He's a shedder.
- Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I'll talk to my supervisor, see what can be done.
Great.
Thank you very much.
See, Charles?
Things are starting to look up.
Up your butt!
Adrian!
What a coincidence.
We were just filing a complaint about you.
You were obviously listening.
I don't know why I'm trying to lie.
Oh, we're locked in.
Great.
First you cut me out of your lives, then you try and get me fired?
My therapist was right about you guys.
- You're a couple of dinguses.
- You have a therapist?
Yeah, he's helping me work on my rotator cuff.
Oh, I see, it's a physical therapist.
Oh, he's very physical, Charles.
Very physical.
So what do you think?
Mm, I don't love the sash.
But it's fine.
I'm just gonna get it.
What?
That's the first one you tried on.
I once saw you look at 54 different accordion folders and not buy any of them due to weak tabs.
I file hard.
I need strong tabs.
I just don't want to take up any more time.
Your break's not even a quarter done.
I'll stay another ten minutes.
You'll stay until I dismiss you.
Irene, music.
-  - Now spin.
-  - All units, attempted 1030-Charlie.
Bodega on Smith.
Perp is heading east on Baltic.
That's us!
We're on Baltic.
Oh, crap.
That was him!
Hey!
NYPD, stop!
Hey!
- Stay down!
- Damn, sarge.
Maybe I do like the sash.
Sir, brace yourself.
Olivia Crawford just tweeted a post of an officer carrying a woman through knee-deep flood waters.
Spoiler alert: they are of different races.
Terry teared up.
I love when calamity brings people together.
Sir, it got another retweet from the mayor.
It got a retweet from the governor.
Well, I have already set up my accounts, and not to toot my own bugle, but I think I did an admirable job.
Oh, okay, what's your handle?
I'll be your first follower.
It's @5261796d6e6420486f6c74.
It spells "Raymond Holt" in hexadecimal code.
- Clever, right?
- Captain, are you sure you wouldn't like some help with this?
Oh, no need.
Now, for my first tweet, I think I should give an update on the water main break that's actually informative.
"NYC H20-Main  at 2040 ED current PSI 456 MAX CAP 204000 LPM".
Suck on that tasty lemon drop, Olivia Crawford.
-  - Oh, look at that.
An alert.
I'm probably trending already.
What?
My account has been deactivated?
Twitter thinks you're a bot.
Why?
I am a human.
I am a human male.
Adrian, open up.
Get out of here, Travis!
Come on, Adrian, admit it.
You have a conflict of interest.
How could I have a conflict of interest?
We barely have a relationship.
We're not even friends anymore.
- You saw to that, didn't you?
- That's crazy.
We may have lost touch, but we're still friends.
Oh, is that right, Jake?
Are we still friends?
If that's the case, then when did I lose my virginity?
Oh, man, you've told us so many intense graphic sex stories.
I have!
But a true friend always remembers a friend's first.
Jake, we know this!
It's got to be one of the swamps.
Uh, Florida swamp, or Okefenokee Swamp, or oh, was it a bayou?
No, no, no!
I've got it.
Summer of '91, at a screening of "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves".
Well done.
It was Bryan Adams' soundtrack and Kevin Costner's flawless British accent that put us in the mood to get gross.
Next question.
Favorite shape?
- Oval?
- Of course!
- Favorite scent?
- Trick question.
You lost your sense of smell in a  Shipwreck!
Guys, we are friends!
Aww, I love you guys.
Are you still angry?
No, that was a cathartic scream of love.
- Understood.
- Good.
Well, anyways, I'm sorry about how things went down, man.
We should have stayed in touch.
No, it's just as much my fault as yours.
I could have kept in touch with you guys and probably should have told you about my new family.
Your new what now?
Ah, Travis.
Great, you're here.
These gentlemen are innocent and are free to go.
- You're fired, Adrian.
- What?
And as for you, my supervisor and I reviewed your case.
Turpentine is all the proof we need to deny your claim.
The feeling wasn't mutual.
You're so lame, you know that, Travis?
Wait a second.
Is this just because I did molly - with your daughter?
- You did?
Don't think he knew about that.
Just don't ever come back here again.
If you do, I'll have you arrested.
How dare you?
I gave you the best two weeks of my life!
Oh, guys, I'm so screwed.
We got no leads.
I'm not gonna get any of the money back.
What do we do?
We go directly to Travis' house right now, pee on everything he owns, and then burn that place to the ground.
- Adrian, that's it.
- It is?
- Yes!
I knew it!
- No, no, no.
Not anything about anything you said.
But, Charles, didn't you just tell me you fired someone?
Yeah, Ted.
I took him out to dinner.
He thought he was getting a promotion.
It was a whole thing.
He wept a lot.
Not as much as me Yeah, but the point is, he was upset, right?
And he knew where you liked to park the truck.
Uh-huh.
And he never gave me my key back.
He said he lost it.
You really think it's him?
I mean, it's just a hunch, but We should go to his house and burn it down.
I was gonna say we could go investigate.
Sure, sure, sure.
And then burn it to the ground.
No.
No burning of anything!
What?
I already got the match lit.
- How?
- Let's hurry up and get there.
Captain, I'm trying to get your account reinstated, but it could take a while.
They say they have a lot of Nazi stuff on the front burner.
And when you tweet again, you should probably stop communicating in numbers, kay?
There's a 0% chance of that.
Besides, I won't be tweeting anymore.
I just got off the phone with the head - of the selection committee.
- You did?
Apparently, one of the candidates for commissioner tweeted a picture of the water main break and accidentally included a link to his favorite pornographic website - Mm.
- Cosplay-butts-n-boobs.com.
Amateur move.
You should never copy-paste if you're a perv.
It's quite the scandal.
The candidate has dropped out.
It's down to just three of us now.
So I guess this proves I was right all along.
Social media it's a fool's game, and only a fool would play.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
And why is Cheddar wearing a beret?
Uh Kevin saw your photos and was amused, so we started an Instagram account for Cheddar, who now has over 14,000 followers.
-  - Hoo-whee!
It's an incredible feeling.
This is insulting.
First you fire me in front of my family.
Ooh, Charles, his family was at the dinner?
It was not well-handled.
Now you accuse me of arson.
Just get out of my garage.
Hey, Ted?
How come you have all this turpentine?
And this plastic bag filled with matches and magnesium strips.
I found it buried under the back porch, and I'm no expert, but it seems like that's the kind of stuff you'd use to light a fire, right?
Oh, there he goes.
Say it with me, Jake.
You've been - Denied!
- Butt-slammed!
- Wait, what?
- Denied, like the stamp?
Oh, that is so much better.
"Butt-slammed" is so stupid.
Oh, is that the wedding dress from the Erica Somerfield 2018 fall collection?
No way, the bodice is totally different.
Why do you two know so much about wedding dresses?
They're the only thing you can look at around here with safe search on!
All right, that's enough.
Can we all get back to police work and stop talking about wedding dresses?
No.
We're gonna talk about them, because while wearing a wedding dress, you leapt over a couch, sprinted down an alley, and jumped off a car to subdue the crap out of a perp like you were Wonder Woman.
It was pretty cool, wasn't it?
Amy, you are an amazing cop and a great leader, and you have proven that a billion times over.
You can't let other people's opinions get in the way of what you want, especially because other people suck.
Well, if I'm being honest, - I would like a prettier dress.
- There you go.
And I would like it to have some lace.
- Uh-huh.
- And a sweetheart neckline, - thank you very much.
- What else?
And I want a mermaid cut with tulip sleeves.
Say it again.
Say it loud.
A mermaid cut with tulip frickin' sleeves!
Pimento's here!
All right!
Thanks so much for that text, man.
- That meant a lot.
- The one that said, - "Want to grab a drink tonight"?
- Yeah.
Hey, Boyle, did you get that insurance payout?
Yes, I am out of the food truck business, and I no longer start spontaneously weeping.
- Nice.
- Listen, I'm sorry you got fired.
Oh, don't worry about it.
I got myself fired, all right?
Plus, doesn't matter.
I got a way better job now.
I'm working at one of those fancy hand lotion stores.
Spoiler alert: I have a gun again, and I've gotten to use it three times.
You would be surprised how often teenage girls try and shoplift mango hand cream.
- Huh.
- But it smells great!
- I love it.
- I can get you some.
Well, listen, man, I've got something for you.
Really?
For me?
It's an invitation to my wedding.
Aw, Jake, I am so honored and would love to be oh, nope, I can't make this.
This is the same night as Lady Gaga.
Oh, thank God.
I didn't run it by Amy, so this worked out great for both of us!
But honestly, nobody's gonna come to this, because everybody's gonna be at Gaga.
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
1  Here comes the bachelor, all dressed in my nice jacket I only wear for special events.
- Oh, you're already on fire.
- Thank you, my friend.
And gentlemen, welcome to my bachelor party.
This is the elite party squad.
That is, assuming the captain is ready to let loose?
- Captain?
- I don't think so.
I want you guys to think of me as one of the boys.
So tonight I'll be swapping out my captain's hat for my Kangol hat.
Call me Raymond.
Okay, Raymond in the Kangol hat, I will definitely call you Raymond, Raymond in the Kangol hat.
- This is the best night of my life.
- Mine too.
Sharon gave me permission to get wasted.
She's even putting a pasta pot - next to the bed in case I hurl.
- Smart.
I'm definitely putting a pasta pot on our wedding registry.
Charles, tell us everything we're doing tonight.
Well, that could take a long time.
I've been planning this bachelor party for ten years.
But I met Amy eight years ago.
What does she have to do with this?
JK.
I'm happy for you both.
No, no, tonight is about creating a bond that will last forever.
Tonight is about The Batch Boys.
Eh, we can brainstorm the name later.
No, we can't because I already made fanny packs.
Ah, well, that settles that.
- This, uh, clearly says "Bach Boys".
- No, it's "batch".
You know, like the beginning of "bachelor".
I've been working on this for ten years don't ruin it!
Okay, so let's fanny up, Batch Boys, because it's time to party.
- Whoop whoop!
- Yes.
Whoop whoop, Raymond in the Kangol.
Let's go.
I'm so excited for tonight.
Thank you to my best friend, Kylie, for organizing this.
And thank you for coming, ladies and gentlemen.
I still don't get why you guys are here.
Well, as I understand it, Amy - lost some sort of bet with Jake.
- It's true.
In hindsight, we should probably stop making major decisions through bets and competitions.
More importantly, why are you guys dressed like that?
You look like you're on "Empire".
- That's what we were going for.
- Drip drop.
We brought you a little gift.
I had to guess on cup size.
- Just gonna burn that for you.
- Thank you.
Amy, I too have a gift, okay?
Tonight, until the stroke of midnight, I will not make fun of you in any way at all, - no matter what.
- That is so sweet.
And my gift to you is a cray-cray night of funky fun!
I fear I've already made the biggest mistake of my life.
So, Kylie.
What's the first event of the night?
I thought we'd start by discussing the etymology of the word "bachelorette".
Whoo-whoo!
Or we could just play "Never Have I Ever".
- Maybe later?
- I'll start.
Never have I ever flashed a bartender to get a free drink.
You guys know how the game works, right?
You drink if you have done it.
- Oh.
- We understand.
Okay, Batch Boys, the festivities official begin now.
Let's just grab a couple cabs or Oh, my God.
What do we have here?
- Damn!
-  - Nice work on the limo, Charles.
-  What - What just happened?
- Well, that was weird.
A suspicious bag.
Maybe we should see what's in it?
- Ooh.
- A mystery bag.
I hope it's got those light-up necklaces.
People love seeing large groups of drunk men wearing those.
- Nope.
- It's a bunch of school supplies.
Is this gonna be one of those scavenger hunts, Boyle?
'Cause that pasta pot isn't filling itself.
- Come on, Terry.
- Let's just see what the plan is.
- Charles, what are we doing?
- I don't know anything about it.
But why don't we take this map and this sextant and chart a course to the restaurant?
Title of your sex-tant tape.
Ah, did not work at all, but I love that you attempted it.
Title of your sex-tant tape.
All right, let's go!
Never have I ever had sex in the back of a car.
- No way.
- Everyone's done that?
- Yeah.
- Except for you.
Kylie, you're telling me you had sex in the back of a car?
Actually, it was a school bus, on the way back from Model U.N. with Myanmar.
It's like I don't even know you.
Look, we've done like nine rounds of this, and you haven't drunk once.
Maybe we should play something else that actually gets you drunk.
I love you, dude, but you haven't had the craziest life.
- That's not true.
- I've done stuff.
Just say ones that are a little less wild.
Uh, never have I ever made a turn without signaling.
Okay, a turn is a big deal.
It's not like you said, never have I ever changed lanes without signaling.
Never have I ever changed lanes without signaling.
You guys are insane!
Never have I ever accepted the terms and conditions without reading them.
It's too risky.
Left a movie without watching the credits.
Those people worked hard.
Used more than the recommended amount of conditioner.
- They make the conditioner.
- They know what they're doing.
- This is lame.
- Let's play something else.
No.
No-no-no, okay.
Never have I ever had a one-night stand with a guy from a band.
Whoops!
Yes, I have!
- Whoa, I am V impressed, Amy.
- V impressed.
In fact, Kylie, it was the lead singer of your wedding band.
Boom!
That's right.
I'm a wild girl!
Watch out, Madonna.
Uh, Ames?
I told Jake that you really liked that band and he booked it for your wedding as a surprise.
What?
Surprise!
So, according to this map, the restaurant should be right here.
But it's just an old abandoned building.
- That's odd.
- Unless You don't think when the sun sets that certain letters on that graffiti wall will be illuminated by a shaft of light?
I don't think that.
We've been at this bachelor party for over an hour, wandering around aimlessly and we haven't done one bachelor party thing!
Well, Terry, if you'd like, I could share a lewd story.
Kevin got me quite horny this morning.
Oh, see?
- Come on, guys.
- I'm hungry!
Oh, you're in luck; the fanny pack is filled with granola.
Mmm!
Loose granola.
I don't want fanny granola!
I want steaks and whiskey!
Is this whole night just gonna be puzzles?
- Good question.
- Perhaps that's something - the limo can answer!
-  - Oh.
- Oh, yes, the limo's back!
We finally get to ride in the limo.
Nope.
The limo is not for us.
This is something else.
Oh, no, I'm being kidnapped!
We have your friend!
Your mission is to find him!
Is that a Serbian accent?
It is.
Write that down for later.
Oh!
I'll see you in six hours.
Six hours?
Joe, let us get in the limo, please!
Terry's so hungry!
No!
Okay, let's not get discouraged just because We've been doing this for 93 minutes and we haven't figured out one damn clue.
That's why I said to not get discouraged.
All right, what about book two?
Maybe it's a code.
All we have to do is decipher this list of thousands of random numbers.
Huh, I wonder if one of them is 6-9?
Pretty sure he means 69, but I'm so hungry I can't even appreciate horndog Raymond.
I say we bail on the scavenger hunt.
There's a restaurant one block away that rolls meat to you on a cart.
Charles would be so upset if we bailed.
But what if Charles never knew?
If we can figure out where he's going to be at the end of the night, we don't have to do - any of his dumb puzzles.
- Right.
Instead, we can spend the next six hours eating and drinking and talking about how we lost our V cards.
And then we show up at the final location and pretend we did the stupid hunt.
- Yeah-yeah - Interesting.
All right, I'm not saying I'm on board with this 'cause it's a little bit cruel, but hypothetically, - if we were to cheat - Got it.
I hacked his email.
His password's really easy to guess.
"Dianne Wiest".
And look here.
There's a receipt for a party boat rental and also a cake delivery to a dock down in Bergen Beach.
That's got to be where this night ends.
All right, fine.
We will stop and get one tiny, little snack just to recharge our brains and bods, but under no circumstances will we do any bachelor partying without Charles.
Whoo!
I'm getting married!
- This is my bachelor party!
-  You guys, I can't have some rando one-night stand at my wedding.
I'm on the band's website.
Not to tease you, but just so we all have the complete information.
- Which one is he?
- Constantine Kane.
Yes.
I see.
Why don't you just cancel the band?
If I cancel, I'll have to tell Jake why, and I don't want to do that.
Well, it says he's playing a solo show in Bed-Stuy tonight.
We can just go down there and ask him - to pull out of the wedding.
- I don't know.
Tonight was supposed to be about us bonding, and instead, it's just starting to be about some dude.
No, it's about your bachelorettes having your back.
But I wanted tonight to be fun.
And it will be.
We're having a drunken adventure!
Really?
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Yay!
Bachelorette adventure!
Kylie, you should talk less.
Sorry, I have to direct it somewhere.
Nice to meet you, by the way.
Hey guys, if you're running out, I'm just gonna take Hitchcock to the hospital.
Is he okay?
He drank a lot during "Never Have I Ever".
We're gonna get his stomach pumped, try to get ahead of this thing.
That meat was good.
You know what we should order?
More meat.
Yeah, we should.
We're "The Steak Studs"!
The Steak Studs!
No-no-no wait!
Charles already gave us a name.
And that is the only one we're gonna use.
Steak Studs!
Steak Studs!
- Wait-wait.
- Steak Studs - It's Charles.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Everyone, calm down.
It'll be fine.
I have an idea.
Why is everyone looking at me?
You just said you had an idea, then you stopped talking.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm very intoxicated.
Oh, he's FaceTiming me, you guys.
What do I do?
He can't know we're at the restaurant.
I need a neutral background.
I'm a neutral background!
- I'm huge!
- Yes.
Genius.
Let me put on my jacket.
Okay.
Hey, best man.
- Jake!
- Oh, I'm so scared.
The kidnappers have me tied up and W where are you guys?
I don't want to say, in case the kidnappers are listening.
- Smart.
- But please hurry.
They're torturing me like James Bond in "Casino Royale".
It's all groin stuff!
Oh, my God.
Save me!
Save  That was close.
So should we order another round?
And that's why I cry Every time I eat my pecan pie A la mode - Yeah, Constantine!
- Thank you.
Namaste.
Look, in my defense, he didn't used to have that man bun.
It was just a ponytail.
I'm just gonna write some of my thoughts down just to let them out, so I don't explode.
Okay, look, no matter how lame that dude's man purse is, Amy Santiago still had a one-night stand.
- To Amy!
-  Amy!
- Yeah.
-  Actually, it technically wasn't just one night.
- Explain.
- Well, he caught me trying to sneak out the next morning, and then he started crying, so I hugged him, and while we were hugging, um, his mom FaceTimed, and he introduced me as his girlfriend.
Okay, so then right after the call, you broke up with him, ended it.
- Uhh - How long were you with crying wedding-band man bun?
Not that long.
I doubt he even remembers me.
Oh, my God.
Amy Santiago.
Ladies and gentlemen, the love of my life is here.
Three months.
We dated for three months.
-  All right.
- This is the boat.
Now, Charles has to think we're totally sober and we solved his puzzle.
- So we good?
- Yep, I'm drunk as hell!
- That's not what I asked.
- Don't worry about me.
I've seen you do enough of these harebrained schemes to know how to play along.
If Charles asks what's wrong, I'll just put on a quaint smile and say,  "Nothing".
Amazing.
That is actually perfect.
All right, now let's hold on to each other for balance like three totally sober grown men.
Come here.
And here we go.
Oh, yeah, we're nailing this.
Hello?
Charles?
Surprise!
Welcome to the party, pal!
Wow!
This is amazing!
Yeah!
Now we get to the best part.
Steaks and shots!
Ohh, more meat and alcohol.
"More"?
What does that mean?
Uhh  Nothing?
- Isn't this great?
- Uh-huh.
So there is one question about the scavenger hunt you have to answer.
Was he everything you thought he'd be?
Yes.
He was everything I thought he'd be.
Never before has a person so perfectly met my expectations.
I know!
Isn't Reginald VelJohnson the best?
Reginald VelJohnson?
From "Die Hard"?
Sergeant Powell was a part of my bachelor party?
Is what I said upon meeting him.
I'm just still emotional about it.
I can't believe you pulled that off!
Yeah, I did.
I have one more surprise for you.
If I could have your eyes, ears, and emotional cores  I'd like to take you all on a journey.
Wow, you got a lot of photos of my birth.
Your mom didn't have any pics, so I had to call the hospital.
- Ah.
- Jake Peralta.
My partner.
My best friend.
My brother.
My idol.
The one man who has never let me down.
Oh, that's very kind.
Tonight had to be the biggest, most special bachelor party ever.
It had to be extraordinary because you, my friend, are no ordinary man.
In fact, you are 24 karat gold.
So if we get the big jobs and we make 24 karat gold!
- Is that a phrase I say?
- No.
Like the coins from the hunt!
- Yes, of course.
- From those.
Now, Terry, please present your gold coin.
My gold coin?
The hell?
From the last stop, the one with Reginald VelJohnson.
Yes, right, I already told you that I was there and I met him.
Stop bringing it up.
Terry, give the man his coin!
- The hell are you talking about, Jake?
- The coin.
Give him the coin.
- What coin?
I don't have a - You give him a coin.
- Give him his gold coin.
- What's going on, guys?
All right, here's the deal.
Terry's coin fell out of his pocket, and we lost it.
We just didn't have the heart to tell you.
Oh, no.
That cost $800.
All right, Terry will pay me back later.
- What?
- Captain, your coin, please.
And as our lives change - I ate mine.
- You ate your coin?
Yes, I thought it was chocolate.
But you hate chocolate.
It has "too much taste".
Oh, man.
You guys didn't do the scavenger hunt, did you?
And you call yourselves The Batch Boys?
Actually, we call ourselves The Steak Studs.
Raymond!
Why?
-  - I know why you're here, Turtle Bug.
I feel like the fact that you just called me that means you don't.
Uh, quick question: If I make fun of Constantine does that count as making fun of you?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- Can I make fun of you?
- I'd rather you didn't.
Well, I have to remove myself from this situation.
Look, I want to talk to you about a gig you have coming up.
- Jake Peralta booked it.
- Yeah.
- Your wedding.
- What?
If you knew that, then why did you take it?
I wrote you a love song.
I'm gonna sing it, and I'm gonna win you back.
Then we're gonna be on "The Today Show".
- I love Hoda.
- Yeah, no.
No, we will not.
This is what's gonna happen, okay?
You're gonna call Jake, tell him something came up, and you have to cancel the gig.
Not happening.
I'm gonna get on that stage.
And I'm gonna play "Amy Come Back".
- Fine.
- I'm gonna tell Jake everything.
I'm cancelling your band.
Boom.
- Okay!
- That'll just cost you $15,000.
Excuse me?
Well, when I heard it was your wedding, I knew your fiancÃ© would cancel when he found out about us, so I put in a huge kill fee.
-  - Yeah, he never even noticed.
He didn't read the terms and conditions.
Look, Charles, I'm sorry that we cheated, but your puzzle was too hard.
Oh, don't give me that excuse.
I worked hard on this night!
And it all led up to this moment where everyone gives you $3,200 in gold coins!
Again, is the gold coin thing based on something I said?
You're 24 karat gold!
- Yeah, right, okay.
- You guys are the worst.
You're right, and we shouldn't have lied to you.
But all of this, the puzzle, it's what you wanted, not me.
I just wanted to hang out with my friends.
Well, don't let me stop you.
You can hang out with your friends all you want, because I'm leaving.
Charles!
Come on, slideshow.
Boyle isn't picking up and I called Genevieve.
- She doesn't know where he is.
- Wait.
I bet Charles is looking for the coins he hid all over the city.
They were so expensive.
Also, why does he keep saying I'm 24 karat gold?
- No idea.
- Makes zero sense.
We'll have to figure it out later.
In the meantime, we gotta find those coins.
Yes, but how do we figure out where they are?
All we have to do is solve the entire six-hour scavenger hunt immediately.
Raymond, toss me that sextant.
Guys, we can do this!
-  - We cannot do this.
We're way too drunk.
But there has to be someone that knows where those coins are, right?
Charles.
- Charles would know.
- Brilliant!
We just have to find Charles, but where might he be?
He's probably digging up the gold coins.
But who would know where the gold coins are?
Charles!
Charles knows where they are.
But where is he No, wait we're stuck in a loop.
We're super drunk and we're in a loop.
We need to find someone who isn't Charles who knows where the coins are.
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.
- It's Reginald VelJohnson.
- What's going on?
- Who are you?
- I'm Jake Peralta.
You were part of my bachelor party tonight.
Oh, you're the jerk who didn't show.
He knows who I am.
Okay, so I need to come up with 15 grand or my father/daughter dance is going to be performed by that.
Wrong.
You're forgetting the most obvious option.
Steal the contract and destroy it.
Destroy a legal document?
I can't do that.
You were right, I'm a boring square who's never actually had a crazy, stranger bone session.
Gina, your looks are just as hurtful as your words.
I'm sorry.
I can only control so much.
- I shouldn't have come back.
- Okay.
Look.
You don't have to steal it.
We will.
- Right?
- Hell yeah.
You guys don't have to do this.
We told you.
We're your bridesmaids.
We have your back.
Okay.
I think if we distract him, I can sneak in and take the contract out of his man purse.
Won't he know what's going on?
He saw all of us with Amy.
Not all of us.
Sick set.
You were really jamming up there.
- Oh  - I'm Lucious Lyon.
Record executive at Executive Records.
Lucious Lyon.
I've heard that name.
Anyway, we're always looking for new talent.
"We" being me and my partner.
That's Cookie.
Let me introduce you.
Where is it?
Where is it?
Why are there so many scarves in here?
You looking for this?
I see him, Gina.
Thank you.
Look, Sergeant Powell, oh, I'm sorry, is it okay if I call you by your character name from "Die Hard"?
- No.
- Okay.
Look, Reginald, do you know why Charles hired you?
Because I love "Die Hard" more than any other movie, - and I loved you in it.
- For the record, I loved you from "Family Matters".
Carl Winslow made me want to become a cop.
Come on, Terry, you already have like six other reasons you became a cop.
This is not your moment.
And for the record, that's the first time I've ever heard him even mention "Family Matters".
- Look, it's late.
- Please leave.
Come on.
Look My best friend is out there.
And you're the only one who knows where he is.
So, as much as I hate to do this, you're gonna tell us where those coins are hidden, - or you're gonna regret it.
- What are you gonna do to me?
Stay here all night, making this sound:  Fine, fine.
- I'll tell you where he is.
- Yes.
Thank you so much.
Also, we're gonna need you to take us there, 'cause we're all too drunk to drive.
You thought you could distract me with a record deal?
Please, I'm already represented, by my mom.
- God, you're a turd.
- Well, this turd is your best friend's future husband.
- Doink!
- Hey, wait, no!
- Give that back to me!
- I'm wild!
- Keep going!
Keep going!
-  - He's gaining on you.
- Not for long.
Free shots for everyone!
Turtle Bug!
Whoo!
Buh-bye, Connie!
Tell your mother I said I never loved you, and that your whole family is a bunch of friggin -  -  - Oh.
-  Whoo, I broke a rule!
Never have I ever slept with a guy, broken his heart, hired him to play at my wedding, stolen a legally binding contract from him, jumped on a bar and dumped booze on everyone, fallen off the bar, probably given myself a concussion  and a permanent scar.
- I have ever!
-  Well, it is officially after midnight, so I can now say whatever I want.
-  - Uh-oh.
Tonight was awesome, and I loved hanging out with your dorks.
- What?
- Aww, yeah.
-  -  You know, the word "dork" is actually a Celtic word meaning "lungfish".
Kylie, I'm trying so hard.
This is where he told me to wait for you.
Oh, my God.
This is the corner where John McClane met Zeus Carver in "Die Hard 3".
Oh, Charles.
Yes, you're here.
What's going on?
How did you find me?
Did you solve the puzzle?
No, they didn't.
They cheated again.
Reginald.
Hey man, look.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
No, I'm the one who should apologize.
I overdid it tonight.
I wanted everything to be perfect, because it's our last big night before you get married.
I guess I was a little worried things were gonna change between us.
Oh, Charles.
Come on.
Of course, things are gonna change.
I'm getting married.
I mean, didn't you make me less of a priority when you and Genevieve got together?
- Yes.
- See?
I mean, no matter what, we'll always be best friends.
-  - Hey, you know why I didn't like your scavenger hunt?
'Cause it was stupid and overcomplicated.
And way too long.
- There was no food.
- Or drinks.
This is not a group conversation, guys.
Well, you could have stood a little farther away from us then.
Point taken.
I didn't like it because you got kidnapped right at the beginning.
You were gone for six hours.
I wanted to spend my bachelor party with you.
I can't believe you pissed off Reginald VelJohnson just to find me.
Oh, please.
He'll get over it.
No, I won't.
You've made an enemy for life.
And I'm telling Bruce Willis you suck.
That's fine.
I'm fine with that.
It's good.
What's important is that we made up, my best friend.
Not Bruce Willis.
To Jake and Amy!
To Jake and Amy!
-  To us!
-  Hey, so I need to tell you something.
I had to cancel the wedding band, because I kind of dated one of the dudes in it.
Yeah, I know.
Man bun.
He left me a very long message - with a lot of details - Oh, no.
He seems like a really passionate guy.
I'm never gonna live this down.
- No, you are not.
-  I'm just kidding.
I'll never bring it up again.
Thank you.
You're the sweetest.
- I love you.
- I love you too, Turtle Bug.
- Oh, my - Yeah.
Uh, do I still need to be here?
Yes, Reginald.
We're all toasted and we need rides home!
It's Reginald VelJohnson!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
1 Jake, hurry up, I'm starving.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I just had to grab my waaaalleeeet Gentlemen.
Fine, I was trying something, and it didn't work!
Okay, before we get going, Sgt.
Jeffords has suggested that it would improve morale if we started the meeting with some consensual non-work jabber.
I just said it might be nice if you checked in on the squad's personal lives every now and then.
Exactly, jabber.
Scully, go.
Well, it was just a regular morning for me.
Woke up again with my dog's butt on my mouth.
This experiment has failed.
Back to work talk.
Peralta, I have a case for you.
- Uh, that's a no-can-do, sir.
- Excuse me?
Oh.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to come across like a rabble-rouser.
We're just simply unavail.
We have a meeting at a new multi-agency, multi-state task force.
- It's a double multi.
- It's a multi-multi.
You're better at everything than I am.
- Don't say that.
- It is what it is.
They're taking down a street racing gang that's been using souped-up cars to transport drugs across state lines.
It's a real-life "Fast and the Furious" movie.
Don't those movies glorify lawlessness?
No.
They glorify family and loyalty and big, hard boobs on both men and women.
And guess who's heading up the task force?
Sgt.
Boomer Maxwell!
- Oh!
- Damn!
Boomer Maxwell?
What kind of name is that?
Is he a football player and/or Rugrat?
Dude, he's an NYPD legend.
I heard he took down three serial killers in one week.
I heard he defused a bomb with his teeth because his hands were tied up.
I heard he bangs constantly.
Hitchcock, no chime-ins for you.
Well, good luck.
I know how competitive these task forces can be.
Especially this one.
Because Boomer's amazing.
- In bed.
- Come on, Hitchcock!
Oh, hey!
What are you doing down here?
Upstairs bathroom's broken I think Scully did it.
He says he hasn't been in the women's bathroom, but who else would leave a whole rotisserie chicken in there?
Did you ask Gina to submit a work order?
Yes, but she hasn't done it yet.
She views doing her job as quote unquote optional.
Well, I'm glad it's broken, 'cause it's nice to see you.
Now, get in that stall and kill it in there.
- What?
- Sorry.
I'm a manager now, so I'm trying to be more motivational.
Oh!
So it's totally cool for detectives to come down here and take dumps in our bathroom?
Excuse me, Officer, you need to check your tone.
Sorry, Sarge, but we're all sick of detectives looking down on us.
I bet you don't even know my name, Rosa Diaz.
Okay, look.
I get that there's always been tension between uniformed officers and detectives, but Rosa is one of the good guys.
I'm sure she knows your name.
You clearly just texted her the answer.
No, she didn't.
Della Avocado.
- It's Alvarado.
- Stupid auto-correct.
I knew you were still one of them.
We all knew.
Great.
Now I'm caught in a turf war between my new squad and my old squad.
I know this is a big deal for you as a manager, but I gotta pee real bad.
Right.
Right, right, right.
I believe in you.
Teach that toilet a lesson!
Oh, my God.
These guys are the best of the best.
- What, are you nervous?
- Yeah!
Very.
You?
I mean, I was, but then I looked at Boomer's personnel file.
We both started in the same precinct, we both took down drug gangs our first year as detectives, and we've both been referred to as El Ganador.
Oh, that's weird.
I've never heard anyone calling you that.
Well, they will soon.
The point is, I'm basically a young Boomer Maxwell.
Oh, you guys didn't hear?
Boomer's not running the special unit anymore.
He shattered both his legs jumping off the Chrysler Building onto a passing garbage truck during a chase.
Damn, that is so cool.
They say he'll never walk again.
Oh.
Well, that's very sad.
But also still cool.
He's gonna be an Ironside!
Wait, if Boomer's not doing it, who's running the task force?
Detective Brett Booth from 6-3.
- Oh!
Cool, cool, cool.
- Uh-oh.
That was your worried "cool, cool, cool".
- Who's Brett Booth?
- We were in the academy together.
During a training exercise, I shot him with a rubber bullet and somehow it got underneath his goggles and hit him in the eye.
It kind of messed up his depth perception.
Oh, but that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's totally fine now and he's forgotten all about it.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't Jake Peralta, my old Rogers!
It happened again!
I told you to keep the walkways clear!
You're gonna regret this, Peralta!
Ah!
Stupid Brett Booth not letting us on his task force.
Just because you blinded him in one eye.
His other one works just fine.
No, I mean, the water cooler thing was pretty bad.
- Yeah, he can't see.
- You know what, screw this.
We don't need a task force to work the case.
All we have to do is solve it before Booth is done with his interviews in two days.
- That's impossible!
- You know I hate the word "impossible" unless it's immediately followed by the words "Ghost" and "Protocol".
- Shh.
- Be advised.
We have a shooting or something - going on in Brooklyn Heights.
- What's going on?
There's an active shooter in a hotel in Brooklyn Heights.
Requesting additional units, squad dispatch.
Multiple casualties.
ESU is en route, and nearby officers are responding to the scene right now.
We have people running.
Advising six or seven shots fired.
Numerous civilians coming this way.
Warwick, 9238, show me going.
9238, I have you going.
Hilbert, 9825, show me going.
- 9825, I have you going.
- What are they saying?
"Show me going" and their badge number.
They're telling dispatch that they're close by and they're responding.
Diaz, 3118, show me going.
Diaz?
Rosa Diaz?
That's her badge number.
Rosa's there.
So there's limited information about the situation in Brooklyn Heights, but I did manage to speak to a captain at the 9-7, - who offered an update.
- Do we know how many shooters?
Two, possibly three.
Again, the situation's still developing, but as of now, there are three dead and multiple wounded, all civilians.
So we're going up there, right?
To help Rosa?
ESU is on the scene, and the 9-7 is locking down the area.
It's already a zoo.
They wanted us to remain on alert - but not to respond.
- Yeah, but that's just a suggestion, like how they tell you to drink eight cups of water every month.
- A day.
- Sarge, come on.
- This is not the time for jokes.
- No, it wasn't a suggestion.
We've been ordered to go about our business as usual.
I know you're all concerned about Rosa, but she's not going in alone.
She's part of a massive NYPD response.
And it's Rosa, right?
I mean, she's a badass.
She's the toughest of all of us.
No offense, guys.
- No, that's accurate.
- Very fair.
I could take her.
What?
I'm wily.
I promise you, I will keep you updated if I learn anything.
In the meantime, you all have jobs to do.
Dismissed.
Ames.
She's gonna be okay.
I know.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
Are you done trying to get into Amy's pants?
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I'm freaking out.
Look, I'm worried too, but spiraling isn't gonna help anything.
We can't go up there, so the best thing we can do - is try not to think about it.
- How are supposed to do that?
Well, it's called compartmentalizing.
Not to brag, but when you come from a broken home, you get pretty good at it.
It's like, "Hey, whose bra is that in the back seat of my dad's car?
I'm sure it just blew in there on accident.
Anyways, off to third grade"!
I can't.
I dwell on everything.
I'm a dweller.
I wake up every morning, I'm worrying about the Zika virus.
Why is nobody talking about Zika anymore?
There's no way it fixed!
Okay, look.
We'll just ignore what's going on together.
Okay?
Let's focus on the case.
Let's become street racers.
Okay, Charles.
How do I look?
So cool.
How do I look?
Uh you definitely made a choice.
- You almost look like - Speed Racer?
Right?
This is exactly what he wears!
And the best part is I can use the kerchief to start the race!
Well, I wanted this op to feel normal, and it does.
This is quintessential Charles.
Okay.
Let's go over the backstories.
I can start.
Actually, it's maybe better for me to go first so you can make some internal edits before you say yours out loud.
- Perfect.
After you.
- Great.
My name is Axel Richards.
I've been driving stolen cars since I was six years old.
- Wow, that's young.
- Oh, yeah.
I had to use a Wiffle Ball bat to just reach the gas pedal, and I never learned to use the brakes.
- That sounds so dangerous.
- Not if you know what you're doing.
- Great response.
- Thank you.
Anyways, things went south when I got addicted to drugs after my best friend died in an active shooter situation.
Oh, I see what I did there.
Hey.
What are you doing in here?
Holt's scanner was making me anxious, so I came in here to listen to some calming music.
It's me singing the song I wrote.
Subway girl Gettin' all the looks Holdin' onto your Big pile of books, yeah Listen.
I was thinking, Rosa seemed pretty annoyed about the broken toilet up here, and since she's having a rough day, I thought it would be nice if we got it fixed for her before she got back.
And you came to me 'cause I'm the only one who ever gets anything done around here.
And because you were supposed to get it fixed last week, so it's kind of a second chance for you.
This is a time of crisis, so we're supposed to be lifting each other up.
Why don't you call that plumber I've been asking you to call for a few hours now?
All units, hold your positions.
Any news, Sergeant?
Uh, last I heard, they've located one shooter, but they can't get to him.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were on the phone.
Oh, just on hold.
What's up?
I just wanted to check in to see if you were all right.
I couldn't help but notice that you've flattened your mouse.
Sorry.
I get crushy when I'm nervous.
If there's anything you want to talk about, my door is always open.
Metaphorically.
In reality, I often keep my door closed, for privacy, security, climate control You know what, I never even should've used a metaphor.
I'm better than that.
If there's anything you want to talk about, please do so now.
There is.
I'm so scared for Rosa.
And I realized, I haven't looked at my life insurance policy since Ava was born.
I'm on hold with them now.
Terry needs a bulkier plan!
Look, I get that you're worried about your own mortality.
Perhaps this fact will comfort you.
As an NYPD officer, you're more likely to be crushed by scaffolding than to die on the job.
Oh, God.
This is a city of scaffolding!
No, no, Sergeant, I was only trying to point out that there are millions of potential ways to die.
Do you know how common choking is?
What are you doing, man?
Yeah, so this won't be a problem.
I can pencil you in tomorrow.
Oh.
Uh, we kind of need you to fix it before our friend gets back today.
I'm sorry, it's gonna take a while, and I have other appointments.
Well, can you cancel them?
I didn't want to do this, but our friend is a cop, and she's caught in a Brooklyn Heights shooting right now.
Oh!
So you think you're the first people that ever needed a toilet fixed 'cause a loved one's life was in danger.
- Yes?
- You're not.
Welcome to New York.
That's a grim commentary on the city we live in.
Refresh.
No news.
Refresh.
No news.
Why is there no news?
- Charles, come on.
- Compartmentalize, remember?
Try and think happy thoughts like the Shrek musical.
Come on, Jake, you know they shut that down.
The health board said there was too much mud on the stage!
Yeah, probably for the best.
All right, that didn't work.
How about this?
Let's clean up our desks.
Right?
That's always good for a distraction.
Oh, no.
Rosa gave me this notepad.
I remember I was all, "Anyone got a notepad"?
And she said, "Yep, here".
- Oh, my God, that's so Rosa.
- I know.
Okay.
So, before you can change a policy, I'm gonna have to ask you a few medical questions, - check your vitals.
- Great.
Just do it fast.
- Terry knows tomorrow's not promised.
- Okay.
Then let's start with your blood pressure.
We can skip this part.
I always clock in at 130 over 80.
Terry's in tiptop.
Shots fired.
Shots fired!
- What?
- Is anybody hurt?
- I don't know.
- Oh, man.
And your BP's at 290.
Oh, 350.
- You broke the machine.
- All right, screw this.
There were shots fired.
I just got off the phone.
There are two officers down.
Neither one of them is Diaz.
So what, are we supposed to wait until one is?
Sir, we have to go up there.
We have to help Rosa.
ESU has more than enough manpower, and we have been ordered to stay in this precinct by the commissioner.
So what?
He's not a part of our squad.
He doesn't care about her.
Look, I know you're concerned about Diaz, as am I. Nevertheless, I am ordering you to stay in this precinct.
Fine.
I understand that's your order.
- What'd he say?
- Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna go help Rosa.
Okay, I'm going up to the scene of the shooting, and I need your help.
I can't sign tactical gear out of the armory without Holt's approval.
That's our mission objective.
First things first.
Let's synchronize our watches.
- These don't work.
- They're just status symbols.
Okay, we'll use our phones, which are connected to the internet.
I don't get the internet with my Netscape Blip.
Let's just use the regular clocks.
At 3:34, I'll go into the armory and hand the officer in charge a list of items.
Then, at 3:35, you two will cause a distraction that draws Holt into the bullpen.
When Holt's not looking, I'll sneak into the office and answer the phone when the armory calls asking for approval, fooling them with my spot-on Holt impression.
"I'm Captain Holt".
Yeah, I don't know, something feels off.
He sounds too white.
Here's how you do it.
No, no, that's okay!
Luckily I have a backup plan.
I got the Holt soundboard app from Gina.
I'm.
Raymond.
Holt.
Get.
Some.
Get.
Some.
Man, soundboard Holt is so horny.
Anyways, Hitchock and Scully, to distract the captain, I'm gonna need you to get in a fight.
- Us?
The buddies?
- How would that even work?
You guys are adorable.
But we don't have time for this, so figure it out!
Okay, so that plumber was useless.
But we are two smart and capable people who can definitely figure out how to fix a toilet.
Of course we can.
The internet will tell us what to do.
- She always does.
- Yes!
I'll just search "toilet videos".
Oh!
So much porn!
Probably should've been more specific.
"Person fixing broken toilet".
More porn.
How about this?
"Instructional video from a plumber on how to fix an actual toilet".
Still porn!
How is that still porn?
Okay, you know what, this isn't rocket science.
All right?
The first thing we gotta do, shut off the water supply.
Did I do that?
That's an Urkel reference, from the show "Family Matters".
Do you remember that?
Hey, there.
I want to check out some gear.
All right.
Okay.
Get ready.
- It's showtime.
- What?
Hmm?
Oh, I just said I have Showtime.
- The cable channel.
- Mm.
Must be nice.
Scully and Hitchcock are just looking at each other.
I'm a little worried they're not gonna be able You son of a bitch!
Okay, we're a go.
- Ah!
- Ooh!
Oh, my God, they're in a penis punch 69!
- Ooh!
- Ah!
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on?
Why are you fighting?
Well, he punched me in the nuts, so I punched him in the nuts, so he punched me in the nuts, so I punched him in the nuts.
But why?
You still haven't told me why.
- Um - Um Ooh!
Okay.
I just need to get Holt's approval.
Go for it.
- This.
Is.
Holt.
- Hey.
It's Officer Wilg at the armory.
I got Peralta here.
He's signing out body armor and a long gun.
Is he all clear?
Yes.
Approved.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, Raymond.
Can't wait for you and Kevin to come over and meet the baby.
We still on for Thursday, right?
Screw.
That.
I'm sorry, I thought you wanted to meet baby Carol.
Her surgery was such a success.
Screw.
That.
Screw.
That.
Get.
Some.
Good.
Bye.
Ah.
What a weirdo.
Anyways, thanks for the gun.
Okay.
That should work.
The hose thing was disconnected from the pipe thing, so the tub thing wasn't filling.
Now we can just turn this back on.
And test it.
Wait, first, let's say a prayer.
Dear BeyoncÃ©, Solange, Rihanna, someone cool that's white, Cardi B, please bless this flush.
A-woman.
Okay.
Ah!
It works.
We did it!
Uh, what's that weird noise?
It doesn't sound good.
No, no, no.
It sounds fine.
That's totally normal.
We fixed it.
Oh, damn.
- Gah!
- Going somewhere?
Fine, yes, you got me.
So how'd you know I was sneaking out?
I got a couple of very angry texts from Officer Wilg accusing me of quote unquote hating my own goddaughter.
How close are you with Colin from the armory?
Let's focus on the real question.
Why are you disobeying an order from the commissioner?
I'm clearly the good guy here.
All right?
If this was a movie, no one would be on your side.
You're basically the guy in "Ghostbusters" who lets all the ghosts out.
There's no such thing as ghosts.
Exactly.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go help Rosa.
How?
This isn't a movie.
You're not gonna rush onto the scene and singlehandedly take down all the bad guys.
I might.
My gun is pretty big.
It barely fits in the car.
Want to be a hero?
You want to actually get something done?
Your friends and colleagues right here are struggling, and they need you.
I did everything I could.
I tried to distract me and Charles all day long, and it didn't work.
They don't need to be distracted.
They need someone to help them face their fears and deal with the reality of the situation.
Okay, great.
So why don't you do it?
I tried, but it didn't work.
I'm not particularly skilled at emotional jabber.
I was hoping you would step up.
And I was hoping to actually do something valuable like help Rosa.
So are you gonna stand in my way or not?
Okay, I think I got it.
Just have to tighten this here, and here we go.
Please work.
Come on.
Come on!
Flush, you stupid son of a bitch!
Ah!
Wow.
Bitches really do be crazy.
Sorry.
We should just give up.
This was such a dumb idea.
Yeah, it would only matter if we actually thought Rosa was coming home today.
- We should keep going, right?
- Definitely.
Also, it's fun to watch you get destroyed by a toilet.
Hello?
You know what, I'm trying to keep this line open, so I don't have time for your bull crap.
Good-bye, Mom.
I'm so sorry, how's your penis?
Sore.
How's your penis?
- Sore.
- I'm proud of us.
- Still too high.
- Okay.
What if I cut myself?
Just to let some of the blood out?
I'm sorry, but I can't stay here all day.
I have other things to do.
- You a traveling nurse, man.
- Don't big-time me.
I'm sorry.
Look, it's been a tough day.
Hey, everyone, I got pizza.
Grab a slice.
Probably gonna be a really long night, and none of you have eaten anything.
Peralta, why are you back so soon?
Because I wanted to do something.
Hey, guys.
How're you holding up?
I mean, not great, but I know you really don't want to talk about it.
No.
We should talk about it.
I'm really scared for Rosa.
Me too.
And it keeps making me think about my kids.
How do I deal with the fact that every day I leave for work, I might not come home?
Man, I don't even know, Terry.
I don't have kids yet, but I know you love them.
And I feel like that's all you can really do, right?
I mean, now that I'm getting married, I keep thinking if something happens to me, it'll actually affect someone else.
I'd get over it eventually, after a lot of therapy.
I was more talking about Amy, but yes, you too, Charles.
Hey, look at that.
130 over 80.
Back to normal.
I can get out of your hair now.
Nice.
Told you, Andrew.
Terry's in tiptop.
Thanks, Jake.
Captain.
I know you don't eat pizza, but I figured you'd want to be included.
Uh, thank you.
You know what would make a great movie?
One where the hero sits with his friends and they talk about their emotions.
I know that you're just being nice right now, but that would be a terrible movie.
I mean, what would the poster even be?
Just a bunch of people's faces?
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.
They just took both shooters into custody.
Officers got injured in the action.
They don't say how many.
Call Diaz.
Get her cell.
Damn it.
It's still just going to voice mail.
Okay.
I don't have the names of the injured officers, but if Diaz is unharmed, she should be contacting us shortly.
Or, if her phone is dead, perhaps she'll be walking out the elevator at any moment.
Come on, Scully!
You can't be doing stuff like that, man!
I was just making a copy downstairs.
Yeah, well, next time, think.
- About what?
- I don't know!
- Okay, Jake.
- Come on, man.
Go easy on him.
- Diaz!
- Rosa!
You're okay!
Where'd you come from?
Felt like walking, so I took the stairs.
Also, I thought it'd be funny to mess with you guys.
Rosa, you know I hate pranks.
- You love pranks.
- I do.
I really do.
You did it so good.
Were you guys worried about me or something?
No.
So what happened?
Did they shoot at you?
Were you in the thick of it?
It's been a really tough day.
I just want to get a beer.
I don't feel like getting into it.
Are you sure?
Because the journey I went on today taught me that sometimes it's best to talk about things - Jake.
- Right.
It was a stupid idea.
And Holt told me to do it, so.
Let's just go get a drink and sit in total silence.
Perfect.
First, I gotta go to the can.
Actually, you might want to check out the ladies' room up here.
Hey, Rosa, it's me, Gina Linetti.
Welcome back.
Me and Amy made a little surprise for you, and I think you're gonna like it very, very much.
Come on, girl.
Ta-da!
You made it sound like you fixed the toilet.
Yeah, I thought maybe Amy would've pulled something together in the two minutes I stepped outside.
Hey, Gina!
Look what I stole from the Barnes and Oh, my God, Rosa!
I'm so happy to see you!
Wait, are you covered in toilet water?
Yes, big-time.
But this is happening.
Ugh.
Fine.
Kinda feel like I'm lurking.
- Gina, get in here.
- Yay!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I am so sick of this city.
I go into a coffee shop, and as soon as everybody sees that I'm a cop, they stop talking and they avoid eye contact with me.
One lady even walked out.
I am just so tired of being treated - like the enemy - Hey, Hitchcock?
Your penis is hanging out.
Oh.
Well, that's a relief.
All right, there are seven days until the wedding, so we are officially transitioning from the "Month Of" binder to - "Week Of" binder.
- My goodness.
- They're getting bigger.
- You should see - the honeymoon binder.
- Ooh.
Is there a tab for sex stuff?
Several.
And they're cascading.
- Yeah, they are.
- Today's our only day off before Saturday.
We have 24 hours to accomplish a week's worth of wedding prep.
This is what getting married is all about.
And spending your life with your soul mate.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Rosa, why do you have a picture of Sergio Mindar up?
Facial recognition picked him up at JFK yesterday.
He finally resurfaced after seven years.
- Who's Sergio Mindar?
- The bane of my existence.
Bane from "Batman", right?
Continue.
He's a ruthless killer who built a meth empire.
We were tracking him for weeks, but he kept getting away.
Finally, we cornered him in a warehouse.
Every exit was covered and he just vanished.
Then he sent us a postcard from Paraguay a year later just to taunt us.
It was diabolical.
Yeah, it was full of grammar errors and other taunts that normal people care about.
That was the first time I was the primary on a case.
The fact that I let him get away still haunts me.
He's been in every dream I've had for the last seven years.
Even the one you told me about where you're flying on a marshmallow?
Who do you think was riding - the jellybean I was chasing?
- Mindar.
Well, you won't be haunted any longer because we're gonna catch him.
Rosa, I'm working this case with you.
Jake, I know we have a ton of wedding stuff to do, but No, no, no.
You absolutely have to do this.
He's your white whale.
He's your Johnny Franzia.
- Who?
- My archnemesis?
Johnny Franzia?
The guy who's been tormenting me with a deck of cards for years?
"Looks like deuces are wild, Peralta"?
Seriously?
I feel like I talk about him constantly, but it doesn't matter.
You definitely have to go.
I'll handle the wedding stuff.
Are you sure?
It's a lot to get done in one day.
Absolutely.
You work the case, and hey, if you guys need any pointers on a cool high five or something, I could Well, if you need any suggestions, let me know.
- This all looks fine.
- Charles, shh.
- I wasn't talking.
- Shh!
Olivia Crawford just got off the elevator.
My rival for the commissionership?
She's here right now?
I've got to come up with a confident opening salvo.
Think, Raymond.
Think.
- Hello, Raymond.
- Olivia.
You have a little bit of goop in your eye.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I have a source on the nominating committee.
They're making their recommendation to the mayor at the end of next week, and it seems that John Kelly is going to beat out both of us.
Big shocker.
The straight white man wins again.
- Exactly.
- Amen.
That was my complaint about Owen winning "Top Chef Junior," and you guys all acted like I was crazy.
Half of the committee supports John Kelly, and the other half is divided between the two of us.
We're splitting the vote.
So for either of us to have a chance, one of us needs to step aside.
Exactly.
You should drop out.
is what you said to yourself in the mirror this morning instead of checking your eye for goop.
And I agree.
You should drop out.
is what you said to yourself in the mirror this morning while polishing your head.
Don't you think it's time New York had its first female commissioner?
What about its first openly gay commissioner?
Yes, that would be vital and important if you weren't 1 million years old.
You do know that exaggeration is the "huckster's crutch"?
Also, I come off quite youthful.
You just said "huckster's crutch".
Step aside Grandpa.
Hey, hey, Sarge.
Large and in charge like El DeBarge.
Quick "quesht": how would you like to spend your day off with me, doing an endless list of wedding tasks?
I can see from your eyes, you're excited.
No way.
Sharon and the girls are going on a playdate all day and I'm going to see a movie for grown-ups.
No talking animals and tons of cuss words.
I know cuss words.
Come with me and I'll cuss at you all day long, you big piece of crap.
Yeah, that sounds fun, but I'm gonna - stick with the movie.
- No, no, no.
Please don't do that.
Look I promised Amy I could get everything done, and I definitely can't.
Breaking promises is how marriages end, not how they start!
- What is that?
- I have 143 tasks to get through in the next 12 hours.
I set a recurring alarm so I know how fast - I should be moving.
- Well, how's that going?
Not well.
I'm already three tasks behind and the alarms keep piling up.
It's kind of making me feel a little bit stressed out.
Please help me, Sarge.
Please.
Come on, you're, like, the best husband ever.
You're, like, the Tiger Woods of being a husband.
What he was to golf, not what he was to being a husband.
Terry's husband game is flawless.
- Okay, I'm in but you owe me.
- Yes!
Anything you want.
Now, let's roll out, you friggin' dick!
Wait, you don't have to cuss at me, man.
No, it's too late.
It's already locked in.
God, looking at these old files is really bringing back some memories.
Sergio's evil voice, his stupid face His delicious aroma.
Man, I hated how good he smelled.
I know.
That jerk smelled like an English garden.
He almost made me quit the force, but my God, - I could breathe him in for days.
- Why do you think he came back?
According to this picture from JFK, he's taking the bus, so I'm guessing - he's out of money in Paraguay.
- Right.
Didn't his number two say he had to leave a bunch of his cash behind before he fled?
Hey, look at this.
Sergio's getting on the B15.
That goes to Bed-Stuy via Garvey Avenue, where he had a hideout in an old brownstone.
I don't know.
You think he's dumb enough - to go back there?
- Yeah, I do.
You know why?
'Cause he forgot who was on his tail.
Nope, he remembered.
And he used the wrong "you're" - and the wrong "too"!
- Son of a bitch!
Ugh!
Damn it, he still smells great.
How is this guy always one step ahead of us?
God, I hate him!
- Ow!
My noggin!
- Oh, no.
It's happening again.
This is exactly like last time.
No, it's not.
What makes you say that?
God, I hate him!
Ow!
My noggin!
Okay, fine.
But not everything is the same.
Honestly, the only thing that's different is Hitchcock's hair.
Ow!
My noggin!
How dare you, Diaz?
Oh, I miss that toupee.
You know it was a reversible?
No, you know what else is different?
We're better cops now.
Look, Sergio knew that we knew about that hideout.
It was listed in his original arrest warrant.
Right.
We need to find a connection to him that he doesn't know that we know about.
Wait.
What about his grandmother?
She was the last person he visited - before he fled.
- I don't know.
I'm just not sure we'll be able to get some old bag to squeal on her grandson.
Clearly, you've never seen me with the elderly.
They love me.
I can talk about coupons for days, son.
That's right, you're looking at a senior queen.
What is that?
That's not a widely used term.
Jake, you gotta pick a napkin.
The binder said they should be beige.
I didn't realize there'd be 45 different shades.
"Chanterelle," "desert whimsy," "filbert husk"?
Words have no more meaning, Terry.
We're running out of time, man.
- You gotta make a call.
- But what if I choose wrong?
That's a terrible way to start off a marriage.
People won't even watch our first dance.
They're gonna be too busy laughing at the napkins.
Okay maybe I can narrow it down.
Uh, I think I don't like desert whimsy.
- Okay.
- Why did you pause like that before you said "okay"?
Was that secretly your favorite one?
Look, you know Amy better than anyone.
You just have to trust your gut.
What is your gut telling you?
That I'm a terrible napkin chooser and will therefore be a horrible spouse.
That is not your gut.
That is your crazy, nonsense brain.
Trust me, Jake.
You know the right napkin.
Is it this one?
With that crimping?
No way.
- Oh, my God, what did I just do?
- You listened to your gut!
Yes!
I have a gut!
My groom gut!
Every groom has one.
You just had to find yours.
Okay, I can do this.
Uh, this one's too big.
This is too scratchy.
This one is shedding.
This one's too rustic.
Am I using that term right?
Yes, you're doing it!
It is too rustic!
This one.
Classy, but very absorbent.
Simple, and it won't clash with our color scheme.
It's perfect!
We'll take it!
- Groom gut!
- Groom gut!
Did you hear anything from Olivia?
She's not gonna step down, and neither am I. - We're at an impasse.
- Okay.
Well, Gina and I have been discussing the situation and we think we know what you need to do.
- Oh?
What is that?
- Whisper campaign.
It's the best way to bring down an enemy if you don't wanna get your hands dirty.
How do you think I stole the cheese club presidency - away from Bruce?
- Whisper.
I heard he thought camembert was goat cheese.
And how do you think I got Janet and her horrible daughter Dakota to drop out - of baby bongos class?
- Whispers.
I heard Dakota has foot in mouth disease.
Sir, you have to give us permission to do this.
Weaponize our sweet little mouths.
Ugh, how are we on the same side of this?
This is not a strategy I'd normally entertain, however, challenging Olivia publicly is out of the question, so what do you have in mind?
- Whispers.
- Yes, I know, but what specifically are the words that you would be whispering?
She lied on her resume.
- She's a shoplifter.
- She planted evidence.
- She seduced a priest.
- She pads her stats.
She's sort of stanky, I heard.
No, no.
I wanna be commissioner of the NYPD, but I want to achieve it honorably.
There has to be another way.
There isn't.
Whispers.
So Louise Mindar is right over there, officers.
Oh, please don't call us that.
- We're undercover.
- Yeah, we're pretending we like old people and don't think they're gross.
Some of us aren't pretending.
I think the elderly are treasured to society.
Actually, from experience, she is more right.
You definitely shouldn't be working here, but thank you for your help.
All right, Rosa, time for some senior seduction.
Hello, Mrs. Mindar.
We're from Sunset for Seniors, and we're here to brighten your day.
- Where's my regular girl?
- Oh, she's sick.
Appendicitis.
Oh, Frank's niece just had that.
- Hi, I'm Eunice.
- Hi, Eunice.
- We're talking to Louise.
- Oh So, I have a really fun activity for today.
- We are going to - You know what?
I was wrong.
Frank's niece had a botched uterus.
Thank you for that visual, Eunice.
I thought we could do an oral history project on your family.
Wouldn't that be a hoot?
Oh, I guess so.
Well, I was born during the Depression, and I had to sleep in a dresser drawer till I was three.
Yeah, this is more of a recent history.
Like, in the last week or so, have you had any visits - from family?
- I don't have any relatives, except for my grandson, who I haven't seen in seven years.
Thank you for reminding me of that.
Yeah, we all have family problems.
The question is, are you going to see him soon?
How do I know?
He never calls me.
My turn.
I was born in the Depression too, but we were extremely rich.
- We had a chambermaid.
- Not now, Eunice.
Okay, so we are way behind.
Picking out napkins took up a shockingly large part of the day, which is funny, because in my regular life, - I don't use napkins ever.
- That's gross, but the good news is, your groom gut is all fired up.
She sure is, and she's hungry for tasks.
- Your groom gut is a woman?
- Yeah, why?
- I think it's really cool.
- Oh, thanks!
All right, let's crush this list.
Calla lilies?
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?
I want dahlias.
No, no, no.
Brown sprinkles at the ice cream bar?
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?
Give me rainbow!
Mini lamb shanks?
Do you think I'm planning a funeral?
Swap 'em out for some tiny tuna tacos.
Why do you keep saying the funeral thing?
Because my groom gut has a catchphrase.
Doy.
Hey, Sarge, look at this!
I cleared all my alarms.
We're amazing!
Should we start a business where we just become professional choosers?
We could call it - "Pro-Choice Industries".
- Jake?
You're right, that name is needlessly political, but the business idea is solid.
No, I'm not talking about that.
All those decisions you made?
You are way over budget.
Oh, no.
My groom gut is a fancy bitch.
Well, our only lead turned to crap.
Let me go back in there.
I just need a little more time with Louise.
Did you see Eunice?
She was practically humping my leg.
No, dude, it's over.
We lost Sergio.
Oh, God, I just wanna crush something.
- Look, we will find him.
- No, we won't.
I thought I was a better cop than I was seven years ago, but I'm not.
I'm still the same loser who lost him back then.
Stupid loser!
That's very wasteful.
Thank you for your wisdom.
Greatest generation.
Look, you didn't lose him back then.
Yes, I did.
I had him cornered - and I lost him.
- No.
I lost him.
I'm the one who let him get away the first time.
- What?
- When we had him cornered in that warehouse, you told me to cover the back.
I thought I heard something on the roof and I left my post.
You always wondered how he got away?
I let him.
It was my fault.
- And I never told you.
- Seriously?
Hey, Louise Mindar has been signed out of the building for a therapy appointment, but she doesn't do therapy and hasn't left the premises in years.
Oh, my God, she must be going to see Sergio.
- Maybe.
- Definitely!
Rosa, we have a lead!
We finally have a lead!
Whatever.
I'm not talking to you.
Let's go.
That seems like a good thing.
Why isn't she happier?
There's a lot going on that I can't explain, Ezra!
But thank you.
Seriously, you saved the day.
Look at us.
Following an old lady, about to catch our white whale.
Ah, just another exciting day for the sleuth sisters.
That's a name I just came up with.
If you like it, stay silent.
Good, I like it too.
That's our name forever.
Oh, that's weird.
The nursing home's calling me.
Hello?
Hello, this is Eunice, the lady from the home with the chambermaid.
- Yes.
- I mentioned Frank's niece's - botched uterus.
- We know who you are, Eunice.
- What can I help you with?
- You said to call you - if I saw anything peculiar.
- Mm-hmm?
There's a very strange man in Louise's room, digging around while she's away.
- Isn't that peculiar?
- Can I put you on hold?
Is there music?
I love the mu I bet that's Sergio.
I bet he set up this whole Louise thing as a distraction to get us out of the nursing home because that's where he stashed his cash before he went to Paraguay.
Damn it, I wish there was some way to know if that peculiar man was Sergio.
Eunice, what did the man smell like?
Like an English garden.
Okay, I have a plan to get us back on budget.
I got my groom gut to agree to a more basic wine package.
Basic meaning simple, or basic meaning "basic"?
Basic meaning "basic," Terry.
We're drinking the wine with the foot on the label, but it's a huge savings and we can make up the rest if we just assemble the gift bags ourselves.
Okay, we can do that.
How much work can that possibly be?
Here are Amy's instructions.
"Place eight Jordan almonds two pink, two blue, "two white, and two purple at the center "of the organza square.
Draw the corners to a point "and use the two-centimeter ribbon to cinch into a mini-bag".
Good lord.
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- That's step one of 38.
We don't have time for that!
We need help.
- We need to hire a team.
- I know, but there's no money in the budget.
Unless maybe we could find people that were willing to work for something other than money.
Hey, Hitchcock and Scully!
How would you two like to earn some candy almonds?
You got our attention.
- Water bottle.
- Nut assortment.
- Local jam.
- Jake and Amy cookie.
- Cone of pretzels.
- Jordan almonds, and Aspirin for the morning after.
- Cake pops.
- And cinch and - Done.
- Blink.
- Mmm.
- Block.
Sir, Olivia Crawford is on her way up.
I know.
I invited her.
Did you change your mind about the whispering?
'Cause we came up with some dandies.
I heard she's a day drinker.
I heard she doesn't like me.
I actually did hear that.
Officer Thomas told me.
I told you I wouldn't be doing that.
I've come up with a different plan - and I've implemented it.
- Raymond.
Hello.
- You have goop in your eye.
- No, I don't.
I rinsed my eyes before you arrived.
Fine.
What's this about?
I wanted to let you know that I've thought it over, and I've been acting selfishly.
I wasn't considering what's best for this city.
That's why, before you got here, I sent a letter withdrawing my name - from the commissioners race.
- What?
- No!
- You're young and smart and progressive and a hell of a lot better than John Kelly.
I've been waiting my entire career for a commissioner like you.
- Captain - If I have to be the bigger person to open the doors to change, then I also felt bad.
And I also sent in a letter withdrawing my name from contention.
We just made John Kelly commissioner.
Not if we get those letters back before anyone reads them.
- Are you too old to run?
- Are you too inexperienced to know that power-walking is a far more efficient and sustainable method of hurrying?
Burn.
Wow!
We're actually gonna get these gift bags to the venue before they close.
Thank you, Terry.
Don't thank me.
Hitchcock and Scully did more than I did.
Yeah, but you had to hold your hand near their mouth when you fed them those almonds.
And that's scary.
We're like snapping turtles.
Exactly.
All right, let's get going.
Those chocolates are gonna melt.
Oop.
Open up.
- I gave you the keys.
- Oh, right.
Um oh, no.
Where did I put them?
Let's see.
I had them in my left hand, and then I went to open the trunk, so I switched to my right hand.
Oh, but then I had to sneeze, and I thought, "I don't want to sneeze on these keys".
Dr. Seuss.
Not really, but should be.
"Do not sneeze on my keys.
Do not wheeze on my keys.
Do not sneeze on your knees on my keys, if you please".
Jake, could you please move along on this thought journey?
Yeah, right, sorry.
Okay, so then I put them on top of a plastic tub, which is locked inside the car.
The keys are locked inside the car!
Why?
- He's gone.
- Look at the vent.
We were right.
He came back for the cash.
Hi, it's Eunice, the lady with the chambermaid.
Yes, Eunice, we know who you are.
That man is in the hall right now.
- What?
- Ooh.
He's heading for the back exit!
Look!
There's Sergio.
Damn it!
He's getting away again.
Not this time, partner.
See you on the ground.
- What?
- You're mine, Sergio!
Ow!
Did he get away?
Yes.
Very easily.
What the hell were you thinking?
You're lucky you just dislocated your knee.
How do you know it's dislocated?
I went to med school for three years.
- You did?
When?
- That's not the point!
Why did you jump off the building?
I was trying to make up for letting him get away seven years ago.
What?
I don't care about that.
You had an instinct.
You followed it and you were wrong.
That happens to everybody.
I care that you lied to me.
It's just we didn't know each other well back then, and, to be honest, when I first got to the Nine-Nine, I was a little intimidated by you.
Good.
Go on.
And then it got more and more awkward to bring up, so I never did.
I just hoped that we'd catch him eventually and you'd never be tipped off to the fact that I let him go.
Oh!
What are you doing with your face and your voice?
I had an epiphany and I got real excited.
I moved my knee and now I hurt a-real bad.
Okay, breathe through the pain and tell me what you figured out.
Someone tipped off Sergio that the cops were visiting his grandmother, and there was only one person that knew we were cops.
That nurse who hates old people, Ezra.
Of course.
Never leave your money unprotected.
That's the first thing I learned in business school.
You also went to business school?
Yeah, and I also have a pilot's license.
Whatever.
Point is, now we have a link to Sergio, - so let's go get him.
- So we're good?
You're not mad at me anymore?
No.
You're about to be - real mad at me.
- For what?
'Cause I'm gonna reset your knee.
- Look at the bunny.
- Huh?
I called the locksmith.
He said an hour.
That means two hours minimum.
We can't wait that long.
Our little cookie faces are already melting.
We look like a couple of Slimers.
Yeah, those cookies are definitely ruined.
- I'll take them off your hands.
- You're a good person, Scully.
This is crazy.
Why don't you have a backup key, Terry?
The dealer tried charging me an extra $300 for it.
I told him I didn't want it because Terry never loses his key.
Yeah, but Jake does.
You always have to plan around me.
I'm a part of your life.
All right, look.
We only have one option left.
You're gonna have to pick up the car and carry it to the venue.
Well, how will we get the bags out?
Is that seriously your only problem - with what I just said?
- Pretty much.
This was a test.
These tasks were a way for me to prove I was gonna be a good husband, - and I failed!
- Jake, being a good husband doesn't mean you have to pass some test or do everything right.
Do you have any idea how often I mess things up?
- So you're a bad husband too?
- No.
Definitely not.
You're cutting in too soon - before the point.
- Sorry.
Look, being a good husband is about caring enough to try.
This whole day, you've been doing everything possible to make sure Amy was happy.
You keep doing that, you gonna be okay, even if you make some mistakes.
You're right.
Thanks, Terry.
Hiyah!
What the hell?
My van!
- What are you doing?
- Whatever it takes to make Amy happy.
You told me to do this.
Now, let's get these gift bags to the venue!
Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?
Because I care!
Oh, I feel so good.
Why'd you break a second window, fool?
You know, you're really stepping on my moment here, Terry.
I love Amy Santiago!
We're gonna take each other's names!
Let's go!
- Boyle, watch the door.
- Watch the door.
That's the job they always give the coolest guy in the heist.
Everyone else, dig in.
We're looking for any letter addressed to Deputy Commissioner Stevenson.
Are we even sure they're here?
I messengered mine over.
There are only three building-wide distributions a day.
The next one isn't until 6:00 p.m., so we still have 22 minutes.
What are we looking for?
Can you describe the envelope?
It was a white number ten.
It's the same kind you use to send fan mail to yourself.
I've never done that, but I do know what envelopes my fans use, so that's very helpful.
Is this it?
Yes!
Well done, Olivia.
Okay, tear that up, and now we just have to find your letter.
What are the dimensions of your envelope?
Zero by zero.
It's too late for me.
I withdrew from the race by e-mail.
- What?
- Yes, I used e-mail, because I'm not a million years old.
Listen, the only reason why I even made it this far is because you stood up for me with the selection committee.
I came here to make sure that at least one of us stays in the running.
Someone has to beat John Kelly.
So you better get that damn job.
'Cause I'm excited to have you as my commissioner.
Thank you, Olivia.
And I'll be excited for you to be commissioner after me.
That'll probably be in a matter of months, once you die from old age.
Go get 'em, Grandpa.
Nurse Ezra, hey.
Do you have a minute?
I'm actually kind of busy right now.
Right, harboring a fugitive.
Should I come back, or he's here and on the move!
All right, Sergio.
We've been waiting seven years to say this.
Sergio Mindar, you're under arrest.
That's Y-O-U, apostrophe, R-E.
I can't believe you caught me.
Well, believe it.
We're an amazing team.
- We're the sleuth sisters.
- Damn straight, we are.
- Lame.
- Stay out of it, Sergio!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
I can't believe this is a rec center.
- It looks amazing.
- You look amazing.
- Foxy as hell.
- Simmer down, Boyle.
No, no, I love it.
- Amp it up, Boyle.
- Happy to.
Jake, your body's kicking and skin is clear as a summer day.
Ooh!
- Jake.
- Ames, you look beautiful.
But when are you getting your makeup put on?
Y'all, she woke up like Diaz.
Not now, Jake.
We're in crisis mode.
The cake hasn't arrived yet.
Mason woke up with the chickenpox, so we don't have a ring bearer.
Plus, look what I found on my veil.
- Ooh.
- I planned everything so perfectly, and now it's all falling apart.
No, it isn't.
Take a deep breath.
All right, we got this.
Terry, Rosa, will you please take this veil to a dry cleaner.
And if they won't do a rush job, make them.
Use force.
I mean, we're not gonna abuse our power.
Of course not.
We're good cops.
I was just exaggerating.
Rosa, I was not exaggerating.
Great.
Okay, now for the ring bearer situation.
This actually might be a blessing in disguise.
I know that he's your nephew, but I wasn't super jazzed about Mason.
- Yeah, he should be cuter.
- His face is too small for his head.
He's a "Dick Tracy" villain.
But I have an idea for a new ring bearer who is very adorable and very obedient.
I would be I'm talking about Cheddar the dog.
- Yep, right.
- Brilliant.
He loves responsibility.
I'll go pick him up.
I'm gonna go with Holt.
Seems like people are pairing off for adventures and we have the best rapport.
Cheddar?
Are you crazy?
- What about my - Allergies?
Got your meds right here.
I brought them just in case Hitchcock decided to wear his toupee again.
It's very clearly not human hair.
Human hair is indistinguishable - from badger fur.
- That is absolutely not the case.
But that reminds me, you two, our wedding band cancelled last minute, and I need you to find a replacement.
You can count on us.
Flattop and The Freak.
We always deliver.
- Our band cancelled?
- Not in any way, shape or form.
But it's a very stressful day and I thought things would go better without Hitchcock and Scully here.
Aw, that's so smart.
Look, babe, we planned a great wedding.
It's gonna be a perfect day.
- Phone call for you sir.
- Ah, thank you.
That would be the cake guy saying he has arrived.
- Hello?
- Jake Peralta?
- Yes?
- There's a bomb at your wedding.
It's set to explode at 5:30.
Everyone inside will die.
So that was not the cake guy.
Okay, we called the bomb squad - and got everyone out of the building.
- We should leave.
Who would do something like this?
Well, I clearly have an arch-nemesis.
Finally.
Must be someone I put away who's hell-bent on revenge.
He's probably gonna make me choose between saving the city and saving the woman I love.
Little does he know, I can save both.
How are you so calm right now?
Someone is trying to blow us up.
I'm calm because there's not really a bomb.
I mean, if you're trying to kill someone, you don't call and give them a heads-up.
So they're just trying to scare us?
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
The bomb squad's on their way.
They'll do a quick sweep, find nothing and split, and this will just become a funny story we work into our vows.
"Amy, there was a bomb at this wedding.
Ya butt.
Ya butt is da bomb".
Please don't say that during the ceremony.
Is it that you don't like wordplay or you don't want me to talk about your butt at all?
Because one of those notes is really gonna pull a thread.
How did this guy even find out about the wedding?
The stupid engagement announcement Charles put in the paper!
It had the time and location of the ceremony.
Amy, be very careful about throwing around accusations like that, because if you're trying to say I somehow ruined Jake's wedding, then I'm gonna kill myself!
So tread lightly.
Okay!
Just take it easy, Charles.
Nothing is ruined.
See?
The bomb squad is already here.
And they brought a robot.
This is exactly how I imagined my wedding would be when I was a kid.
Well, well, well.
Amy Santiago.
Amy, look.
Your ex-boyfriend is here on our wedding day.
Why?
This is my crew.
Yeah, you called me boring, so I leveled up my cool.
And now I run the bomb squad.
I also started traveling.
I went to Belgium.
They have the best spaghetti.
Teddy, let's get everything out on the table here.
Last time we saw you, you kind of proposed to Amy.
So you're not still in love with her, right?
No, I definitely am.
My therapist told me to stop trying to get over it.
Oh, weird that you wouldn't hide it even for your own pride.
But seriously, don't worry.
I'm a cop.
I have a job to do, and I'm gonna do it professionally.
That's great.
I'm happy to hear that.
Meaning I will be doing a super thorough sweeping of the building.
It's gonna take hours, so you should probably just cancel the wedding.
Anyway, congrats you two.
Congrats on the bomb squad.
- Charles!
- Right.
So are you bringing someone to the wedding?
No, I'm taking a break from dating for a while.
- What?
- I'm sick of asking people how many siblings they have.
Oh, is it somewhere between zero and two?
How fascinating.
But you never know when you're gonna find your dream person.
Anyone on the street could be they.
All right, it feels like you Googled "how to talk to your bisexual friends".
Yeah.
Look, the point is you can close yourself off all you want.
The universe will find a way.
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Car's here.
Hi.
I'm here to pick up Rosa.
Are you the one I'm looking for?
Now, Cheddar, when I give the signal, you go directly to where the bride and groom will be.
Here we go.
Hup.
Hup.
Hup.
Hup.
Good boy.
Good, Cheddar.
- How did that look?
- Very weird.
You're not gonna trot by the dog at the wedding, are you?
No, of course not.
I'll be officiating.
You'll be the trotter.
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
- Oh, my.
- What?
I just got an email from the mayor's office telling me if I'm the next commissioner of the NYPD.
Well, well, well, finally something to care about today.
What's going on, guys?
- Someone called in a bomb threat.
- Seriously?
Is this because of Boyle's stupid engagement announcement?
- Yes.
- No!
They won't let us back in the building.
But there's not really a bomb, so it's just temporary.
What about you guys?
Did you get the veil?
- Terry has it.
- I do?
Oh, no, I left it in the car!
It's not my fault.
The driver was so hot.
Not for me, for Rosa.
She was clearly flirting with her.
Oh, I know, I'll just call the company and bring her back here.
And then who knows what'll happen?
Wait a minute, did you do this intentionally so I'd have to see that girl again?
No!
That's crazy.
This is Jake and Amy's wedding.
I would never do that.
But you gotta admit, it does seem like the universe is pushing you two together.
- Terry!
- Right, right.
Look, we'll go find the veil.
I can't believe this is happening.
Don't worry about them.
Let's go check on Teddy.
I'm sure he's made a ton of progress.
Nope.
Haven't even gone in yet.
Still putting on the bomb suit.
Yeah, my job is super dangerous, but I like living life on the edge.
Just kind of sexy if you think about it.
There's no bomb.
If they wanted us dead, they wouldn't have called first.
It's not always the bomber who calls.
Maybe he had a young daughter, found a key to his secret room, came across some blueprints, felt guilty, and wanted to save your life.
- Seems unlikely.
- Well, Amy, in this life, it's sometimes the unlikeliest outcomes that Feels like you're winding up to propose again here.
- I was.
Good catch.
Amy, would you - No!
- You still did it.
- All right.
Well, this is gonna take a while, so you have time to reconsider.
Off to do my super dangerous job.
I can't handle this.
I need a cigarette.
I knew that you would, so I came prepared.
Nicotine patches.
You just put it on your shoulder and Whoa, stuck it right on your face, huh?
I want it as close to my brain as possible.
That's unsettling.
All right, listen up.
I think I know how to fix this.
All we have to do is figure out who my arch-nemesis is, track him down and get him to admit to Teddy that there's no bomb.
We have three hours to save this wedding.
That's good.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
Wait.
You're talking to the nicotine, aren't you?
I can love two things.
Look, I was told to drop off one Nakatomi Plaza wedding cake at 2:15.
Yeah, but they won't let us inside the venue, so can you please take it away and bring it back later?
Sorry, ma'am, I can't.
I have other deliveries.
Man, it's gonna melt in the sun.
Don't worry, Amy, I'm gonna keep it chilled with my cool breath.
Oh, my God, the cake looks amazing!
Charles, why are you spitting on it?
Because I didn't ruin your wedding.
- Kay.
- Were you able to trace the number - that called in the threat?
- Yes.
It was a burner, but they caught it pinging off a cell tower in Fort Greene one block away from the last known address - of Frank Gillespie.
- Who?
I arrested him for armed robbery in 2008, and he got out of Rikers a year ago.
He's got be my arch-nemesis.
He's definitely obsessed with me.
- Just 'cause you arrested him?
- Well, we didn't have enough evidence against him at first, so let's just say I had to get a little creative.
- You framed him?
- What?
No.
Ames.
I went undercover and became best friends with him.
And then he told me about his lymphoma, and we ran a 10K together, and then I arrested him.
He felt so betrayed.
The trial was very emotional.
All right, let's go talk to him.
- That must be our guy.
- Hey, great attitude, Ames.
You're handling this really well.
Ah, there they are.
All right, she should be here any minute.
Her name is Alicia.
Switch with me.
- That's your good side.
- I have a bad side?
Oh, damn, you didn't know?
All right, can we just focus on finding the veil?
Really, it's not a big deal.
I'm sure it's in her car.
Oh, there she is.
Do you mind if I slyly mention you're single?
- Do not do that.
- You won't even notice.
Hey, you needed to see me again?
- Rosa's single.
- What?
Ignore him.
We left a dry cleaning bag in your back seat.
Oh, uh, I didn't see anything, but you can take a look.
The veil's not here, Rosa.
We're so screwed!
Hold on.
Don't freak out.
Rosa!
What the hell are you doing?
What?
You were the one that said That was before the veil went missing, when life was breezy!
Oh my god!
Why is this so heavy?
'Cause you made them do an all-frosting interior.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to eat it.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, Gina, there was a bomb threat; Teddy won't let us in the building; and we had to get our cake out of the sun; and now you're in charge of it so we can go find my arch-nemesis.
- All right.
- Thank you very much.
- Everything okay?
- Don't know.
They only said "Gina" once, and it was kind of in the beginning.
- Huh.
- Did you read the email?
Are you the commissioner?
- I haven't opened it yet.
- What?
Today is Peralta and Santiago's wedding.
I don't want to make it all about me.
- So you're scared to open it?
- Don't be absurd.
I simply want everyone to focus on the bride and groom, and not on whether my lifelong dream, which I spent decades working towards, has collapsed in front of my eyes, leaving me untethered in this world and unsure of my very future with the NYPD.
All right.
Okay, Gillespie's apartment's right over here.
Oh, this is exciting.
We're gonna catch my arch-nemesis.
Do you think he has a shrine of photos of me with the eyes scratched out?
Let's not rule out the very real possibility that it's entirely sexual.
Oh, man, that would be super upsetting and so cool.
- I know.
Isn't it amazing?
- Okay, okay, focus up.
- Let's do this.
- Right.
You look great.
NYPD.
Hello?
Is there a problem?
We're looking for Frank Gillespie.
Frank?
He died a year ago.
- What?
What happened?
- Well, his lymphoma came back.
But really, it was the loneliness that killed him.
Somebody hurt him, and he just couldn't make friends after that.
So it seems like he died because of me.
Just gonna lock that up in a little box in my brain and never open it.
Hey, do you remember Dario Moretti, that money launderer I arrested?
He lives right around here too.
- So?
- He hated me.
What if this is the work of my arch-nemesis and not yours?
So you're suggesting I'm not involved in this at all?
I mean, you hear yourself, right?
- That's a bit of a stretch.
- Yeah, Amy.
Are you actually mad that someone might not hate you?
Yeah, I am, Amy!
Oh, wow, that's a bad color on me, isn't it?
All right, fine, we'll check out your guy and I'll be totally fine with it if it's him.
Oh, man, you got a whole shrine!
Even the eyes are all scratched out.
Babe, when we're married, we're gonna share everything.
Bank accounts, health insurance, arch-nemeses.
Aww, that's nice, Ames, but you don't have to say that.
Charles, will you put this picture of me up on the wall?
Copy that.
You want the eyes scratched out?
Uh, you know I do.
Lieutenant Wells?
Where is Teddy?
- Hi, Jakey.
- Aunt Linda.
What are you doing here?
How'd you get past the police barricade?
Well, I moved them.
Now, I know I was supposed to come here solo, but I had to invite my friend Barb.
She was so down in the dumps.
Yeah, that's all fine.
Don't worry about it.
Actually, you know what?
That's not fine.
Barb can't be here.
You can't just add someone day of.
Oh, hey guys, what's up?
Teddy, meet Dario.
He has a wall full of Amy photos, and he's the one that made the bomb threat.
And I'm Aunt Linda.
Okay, Aunt Linda, I love you but you gotta go.
Okay?
Thank you.
Give us a moment here.
All right, Dario, tell Lieutenant Wells what you told us.
Okay, I've hated Detective Santiago since she arrested me, and then I saw that engagement announcement in the paper.
But you could have figured out where the wedding was - even without that, right?
- No, I was trying.
I had totally given up, really.
Oh, God, what have I done?
Anyway, I made the threat, but there's no bomb.
Just like I've been saying all along.
Now, can we please go back in the venue?
First of all, there's nothing inherently creepy about a wall of Amy photos.
- Uh-huh.
- Secondly, I'm not gonna just take this guy's word for it that there's no bomb.
Why not?
He's the one who would know.
So you think a cop should just stop what they're doing as soon as a criminal tells them they didn't do it?
Oh, my God!
That is actually a really good point.
So I only had one passenger after you, and he got off here.
- Well, what did he look like?
- I don't know.
I mean, he was wearing some dumb hat.
I'm sorry, I know that's not helpful All hats are dumb.
Ha!
What the hell?
Is that your laugh?
Also, quit vibing, and help me solve this.
Sorry, man.
It's what the universe wants.
Screw the universe.
The universe is a dick.
Maybe it fell out when he got out of the car.
Wow, you are so smart.
Oh, oh, yep, yep, yep.
Here it is.
Uh-oh.
It's kind of dirty looking.
But, you know, that's why they put it in a dry cleaning bag.
I'm sure everything inside is totally Nope.
Soaked in urine.
Damn it, New York.
Kay, you've been staring at your phone for 45 minutes.
- Just read the email.
- What if it's bad news?
Sir, do you know how many times I've not gotten something that I wanted?
- How many?
- Zero.
Because I have a trick.
Whatever that email says, you just act like that's what you wanted all along.
Well, I can't fake it.
I want this job.
For years, I've worked nights and weekends.
I've sacrificed friendships.
I've jeopardized my relationship with Kevin.
And now to find out if it was all in vain.
Yeah, let's not check it.
It feels like there's a lot on the line.
Agreed.
Let's just grab Cheddar and go to the wedding.
Where is he?
Cheddar?
Cheddar!
Cheddar the dog!
Oh, he ate the cake.
Oh, Cheddar, you furry little pig.
Okay, Amy.
I got through every room and I cleared them very fast, because I love you and I want you to be happy, even if it's with somebody else.
- Did that new tactic work?
- No.
You just called it a tactic.
Can we get in the venue or not?
Not quite yet.
There's one more vent we can't get into, and our snake cam broke.
We got another one on the way.
It'll be here in about 6 hours.
What?
No.
We need it now.
- People are already here.
- I'm sorry.
The vent is very tight, and no one on my team can get into it.
I've been doing a lot of Pilates so I'm pretty huge at this point.
- I'm going in.
- What?
There's no hole too small for Charles Boyle to squeeze himself into - Come on - Look, this is all my fault.
I put the announcement in the paper and ruined this day.
And now I'm gonna be the one to fix it.
Get ready, you two.
I'm about to save this Bomb!
There's a bomb!
Damn it, Dario.
Why'd you say there was no bomb?
Because I wanted to kill Amy.
Then why did you call in the threat?
I didn't.
My daughter found my hidden room and discovered some blueprints.
Yes, fine, Teddy.
You were right.
Now can you please get the bomb out of the vent - and dispose of it somewhere?
- Honestly, I wish we could.
But it's too dangerous to move.
We have to diffuse it on site.
I have to evacuate this entire block.
- It's gonna take all night.
- Wait, so you're saying Wedding's off.
For real, it's over.
Jakey, what's this that I hear that there's no rabbi?
Not now, Aunt Linda!
Okay, so we just finished processing Moretti.
- Did you talk to our parents?
- Yeah.
They ended up having dinner together.
It sounded like they had fun.
Our dads only got in one arm-wrestling match.
- Who won?
- Neither.
They both threw out their shoulders.
What a disaster.
Yeah.
But, look, I know it seems like everything sucks, but why don't we just get married tomorrow?
You know, we won't have a venue or a band or any of our guests, but we could go to city hall.
Jake, do you really want to get married in the same place people go to get restraining orders?
Amy Santiago, I would marry you any time, any place.
I would marry you in the steaming filth of the Gowanus Canal.
Sweet.
But also, gross.
I would marry you on the G Train in the summertime when the air conditioning is broken.
Damn, really?
I would marry you on top of the Empire State Building.
Well, that sounds kind of nice.
- During a King Kong attack.
- Oh, yeah, that's not good.
Okay.
City hall it is.
No!
I was eavesdropping.
- I'm always eavesdropping.
- I don't like it.
Look, I didn't spend the last seven years watching your love ripen, only to have it sullied by a city hall wedding.
You're getting married right here, right now.
- What?
- Come on.
Boyle, I don't even have a dress.
You can wear Gina's.
I'm sure it's white.
There's no way Gina was gonna wear a white dress to my wedding.
No, I definitely was.
What?
I thought you'd just wear a Grey pantsuit or something.
I would never wear a Grey pantsuit to your wedding, - I promise you that.
- This is happening.
Jake and Amy are getting married tonight.
- Title of my sex tape!
- What?
Whoo!
Yeah whoo all right.
I got a lot to work Lot of work Wha give me a half hour!
Whoa!
Wow.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
This dress is incredible.
Gina, this would have been so crazy - if you wore this to our wedding.
- I know.
Hey, Amy, I know I ruined your veil, but I made you a new one.
- It's a shower curtain.
- Uhh Yep, Terry fumbled the task.
But we got you a bouquet.
Wow.
That's gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Where did those come from?
Alicia found a florist in the city that was still open and picked them up.
All right.
Keep it in your pants.
Okay, here we go.
Jake, Amy, let's go downstairs.
It's wedding time!
So here it is.
I really hope you like it.
But if you don't, I will kill myself.
Charles, it looks amazing.
It's beautiful.
How can I ever repay you?
Get pregnant.
Use your body to give the world more Jake.
Holy crap.
All right.
I'm gonna take Charles away from you now.
I will see you up there.
Wait!
Stop everything.
We're here.
Where have you guys been?
You sent us out to find a band.
Right.
I definitely remember doing that.
It took a while, but I think we really nailed it.
- Check this guy out.
- We found him on the subway.
Hey, I know you.
You're Melipnos.
No.
We have never met.
No, I'm pretty sure we have.
- You sell me horse blood?
- No.
Would you like to buy horse blood?
No.
You know what?
Maybe we don't need music for this.
That's totally fine, we can just skip that part of it.
Guitar.
Holy crap.
Melipnos plays like an angel.
Amy, we're a go!
- Hey, Melipnos.
- I don't know you.
Kay.
Please be seated.
Friends, colleagues, gawking New Yorkers, we are here today to celebrate the marriage of Jake Peralta and Amy Santiago.
I've known you both for the last five years.
And it has been a true pleasure to watch your distracting childish rivalry evolve into a distracting childish courtship and now into what I'm sure will be a distracting childish marriage.
I'm proud of you.
And I love you both.
- Permission to say it back?
- Permission granted.
- I love you too, sir.
- Love you, Captain.
Now I believe you've prepared your own vows?
Yes, I was going to do an "Addams Family" themed rap, but my beat-boxer isn't here.
That's the only reason it's not happening.
So, Ames, today has been a crazy day.
But I shouldn't be surprised, because we've had a lot of crazy days.
There was our first date, our first kiss, the first time you told me you loved me, and the day you told me you would marry me.
Also, yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that, because every single day that I get to be with someone as amazing as you is crazy to me.
I love you.
And I'm worried about dancing in front of our friends.
The end.
Okay, well.
I've been planning this wedding for the last six months.
And if you told me yesterday everything that was gonna go wrong, I would have had a panic attack that sent me into the ER.
But I'm here, and I've never been happier.
Life is unpredictable.
Not everything's in our control.
But as long as you're with the right people, you can handle anything.
And you, Jake Peralta, are the right person for me.
But I do have some bad news.
There is a bomb at this wedding as well.
What?
Your butt.
Your butt is the bomb.
There will be no survivors.
I love you so much.
You're my dream girl.
I love you too.
I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.
Ring bearer, please, bring the rings.
But I thought Cheddar was sick Oh, my God.
You got the robot.
There's a robot at my wedding.
Yeah, I felt bad about how everything went down today, - so I offered to help.
- Oh, that's nice.
Also, are you guys doing that thing where someone gets to object to this union, or is that later?
- We're not doing that.
- You've outsmarted me.
- Congratulations.
- Okay.
Moving on.
Do you, Amy Santiago, take Jake Peralta to be your husband?
I do.
And do you, Jake Peralta, take Amy Santiago to be your wife?
I absolutely do.
By the power vested in me by the state of New York, I'd like to announce that your honeymoon vacation request status has officially been moved from pending to approved.
You're married.
You may kiss the bride.
Congratulations once again to Jake and Amy.
One for you and one for your wife.
Uh.
I have a wife I finally know how bored feels So now that everyone's here, I have an email that I need to open.
All right, weirdo, not something we usually announce to the squad.
It says if he got the commissioner job.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
He was too scared to read it all day.
I was, until I heard something very wise tonight.
Life is unpredictable.
Not everything is in our control.
But as long as we're with the right people, we can handle anything.
So I'd like to receive this news with all of you.
- He quoted me.
- Okay, here we go.
Well, from the look on my face, I'm sure you can guess what it says.
No!
We have no idea at all.
Just tell us, you monster!
