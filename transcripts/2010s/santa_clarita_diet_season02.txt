{START OF EPISODE 1}
1  Imagine me and you, I do I think about you day and night It's only right To think about the girl you love And hold her tight So happy together If I should call you up, invest a dime And you say you belong to me And ease my mind Imagine how the world would be So very fine So happy together I can't see me lovin' nobody but you For all my life When you're with me Baby, the skies will be blue For all my life Me and you and you and me No matter how they toss the dice I've been here 17 hours.
I have to get home.
- Me too, man.
- No, but I really do.
Are you saying my situation isn't also urgent?
No, Ron.
I'm sure you have to get to your apartment before the asparagus people come back.
They're not asparagus people, Joel.
They pronounce it "oz-para-gauze".
And they are certainly not people.
If they were, I wouldn't have to seal my ears with peanut butter at night just to keep them from infiltrating my brain.
They're so intrusive.
And their music I'm thinking this isn't your first time here.
I've been captured before.
Why?
Have you ever found a way out?
Why should I help you when you don't even treat me like a human being?
Okay.
I'm sorry, Ron.
I shouldn't have belittled your conflict with the oz-para-gauze.
- "Oz-para-gauze".
- I said "oz-para-gauze".
We both know you didn't.
Let's not talk for a minute.
It's just my wife is going through this thing, and I have to get her this very specific medicine because she's getting worse.
What's going on with your wife?
Unless you don't want to talk about it because those creatures you mocked with your lazy pronunciation might be listening.
Actually, you may be the only person I can talk to about it.
Code Gray, Psychiatry.
Code Gray, Psychiatry.
She's undead.
Really?
How is that going?
Honestly?
Mixed.
She has an intensity I love, but having to find human flesh for her to eat - that's been hard.
- I can imagine.
We're realtors, so killing people and stuffing them into freezers doesn't come naturally.
That must be exhausting.
Now, she's getting more aggressive.
Who knows what she might do?
I can't be here anymore.
I'm sorry, Joel, but there's just no way out.
And if you try, they will just keep you here longer.
-  - Hello, gentlemen.
- Are you ready for group?
- Doctor, I need to go home.
- We both need to get out of here now, man.
- But I really do.
- Me, too.
- Ron!
My thing is separate.
Joel, you're on a 72-hour hold.
We can't let you go until you're no longer a danger to yourself or anyone else.
- Shall we, gentlemen?
- Wi - Will there be juice?
- One box per person, Ron.
Same as always.
- Can I have yours?
- Then I wouldn't get one.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Okay, bye.
The soonest we could get a Serbian exchange student is six months.
In six months, your mom may be just a rotting, indiscriminate killing machine.
But probably not.
We don't know.
It's all good.
Are you sure it has to be Serbian bile to make the serum?
Yeah, it's in the book.
Since the first outbreak was in Serbia, they're the only ones who have built up immunity.
I feel like I'm blowing this!
Abby, we're trying.
What about that job message board?
- Did you post on that?
- Yeah, a few hours ago.
-  Here.
-  "Are you Serbian?
Do you want to make a $130 just for throwing up?
You know you do.
Send copy of birth certificate.
No dick pics, please".
Yeah, I had to add that 'cause, apparently, it wasn't obvious?
But, honestly, it just made people more creative.
- There's that noise.
Do you hear that?
- I think it's coming from the basement.
Mom?
Yes, honey?
Everything all right?
Yep.
All good.
-  - Are you making that noise?
-  What noise?
-  - Maybe we should check on her.
- I really don't want to do that.
She's chained up.
I will bet every time someone has said that about the undead, it has never ended well.
Okay.
Mom?
What are you up to?
Oh, just book reading.
Any news from your dad?
No, not since last night when he called from the hospital, so Holy shit!
Are you chewing the post?
Okay, here's the deal.
Mommy's going a little crazy down here, so I need to get out.
And I know you're worried I'm gonna go out there and kill somebody, but think about all the people I haven't killed.
Literally, everyone in the world, - except three people.
-  Hey, Abby?
- You should come look at this!
- Yeah, okay.
Look, I'm sorry, but you put me in charge, and I'm not letting you out.
And stop chewing the post.
It holds up the whole fucking house.
We got a hit on the job posting.
There's a Serbian gentleman in Newhall willing to vomit.
Of course he's in Newhall.
Text me his address.
- Tell him I'm on my way.
- Wait.
I'll go with you.
- Is the rest of the serum done?
- Not quite.
My mom is eating the house like a giant, manipulative termite, so you need to keep working on the cure.
- I have pepper spray.
- You know, it's not a cure.
It will only stop her symptoms from progressing.
And there's no way she can get out of those chains, right?
Oh, what am I doing?
Nobody asks that and lives.
Joel, why don't you tell us why you're here?
I got upset and trashed someone's house.
But being here and reflecting on my actions, which were wrong and I'm sorry and will never happen again, has made me feel like I'm ready to rejoin society and interact with my fellow citizens from all walks of life, be they women, men, questioning, different races, tall or small, thin or large.
They all contribute to the fabric of this great country.
Thank you.
Felt like you got a little off at the end there.
- Yeah, I fucked that up.
- Ron, tell us why you've come back to us.
Well I am being harassed by the interdimensional beings again.
But something happened last week.
Tell us about that.
My wife died.
Oh, my God.
Ron, I didn't know.
She'd been sick and wasn't getting any better.
I had her at home and had just finished making her breakfast.
She didn't want it.
She just smiled at me and said, "Everything's going to be okay, sweetie".
And then she closed her eyes.
She was here with her beautiful smile.
And then she was gone forever.
I can't imagine.
I lost my wife for ten seconds, and in those seconds, I wanted to die with her.
Why do they tease us with such tiny amounts of juice?
- Who wins this game?
- Here.
- Thank you.
-  Yeah, yeah.
They let me go downstairs to the morgue yesterday to see her one last time.
The morgue.
I've been to that morgue.
She didn't look the same.
That must have been so hard.
Did you happen to notice if any of the bodies had Serbian-sounding names?
They usually end in the letters "I-C" or the syllable "vich".
Abby?
Oh, shit.
She's not here, Mrs. Hammond!
Oh?
You wanna go in the yard and have a game of catch?
I can't unchain you.
-  Where did Abby go?
- Just out.
Can you come down here for a minute?
No, thank you!
Eric, come down here.
I'm so, unable to say "no" to authority.
The teenager stupidly went below the house.
Great job.
You displayed genuine compassion with Ron.
That shows me you're not a danger to yourself or anyone else, - so I'm going to release you.
- Really?
Whatever your problem is, we're not going to fix it in another 48 hours.
We don't fix anyone.
We just put Band-aids on people and toss them back, alone, into a cold, cripplingly indifferent society.
Totally.
So, I'm gonna get my shoelaces and run down to the basement.
- Are you okay?
-  The only time I talk to someone healthy is when they're saying goodbye.
Well bye.
- So, where's Abby?
- She went to get bile.
Oh, really?
From who?
Some man we found online.
A man you found online?
And you let her go alone?
- She took pepper spray.
- Alright man.
You gotta let me outta here.
- I need to make sure she's okay.
- I'm not supposed Eric, she's 16.
Come on, you can come with me.
I'll even wear handcuffs.
I don't have handcuffs.
My bedroom, bottom drawer.
Don't touch anything else.
- Go.
- Wait, really?
You have handcuffs?
We recently discovered how intense sex is if your lover orgasms while you - How much of this do you wanna hear?
- Less than that.
All right.
Get these chains off and let's find her.
Okay, it's an apartment on Mountain View.
It's near the mall.
Of course, in Santa Clarita, everything's near a mall, right?
So many shopping opportunities.
I talk when I'm nervous.
Hang on.
Uh-uh.
- Huh.
- Mm.
Sorry, honey.
I only wear these in a sexual context.
- Oh, God.
What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna go find my daughter.
Will you help me pop these back in?
- Don't pass out.
- Okay.
No, seriously, don't pass out.
Shit.
Oh, hello.
Are you here for the Tori Amos tickets?
No, your throw-up.
Oh.
You weren't what I was expecting.
Where are my manners?
I'm Goran.
Please, entrez.
No, that's okay.
I'll just take it and go.
I don't have it yet.
I figured you'd want to watch me do it.
No, no, you figured me wrong.
Strange.
I've never fingered somebody wrong before.
I said "fingered".
- Goodbye.
- No!
Wait!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
My sense of humor can be a real jerk sometimes.
Please, come in.
I shall retire to another room at once to produce the precious nectar of my stomach.
Awesome.
Hello.
- I purchased a foot here two weeks ago.
- Yeah, sure, I remember.
- How'd that work out for you?
- Excellent.
Thank you.
I'm looking for something very specific.
I have a vagina I can sell you for 500.
It's a little past its "best-use-by" date, but it'll get 'er done.
Dear God!
Who comes here?
Brace yourself.
Mostly men.
I need a fresh gallbladder, but it has to be from someone who's Serbian.
God, what are you into?
I love it.
Come on in.
Let's take a look around, you sick fuck.
Here is your vomit, milady.
I take PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin - I have cash.
- Oh, how very retro.
I produced a bit extra, - if you'd like to top it off.
- No, I'm good.
- Would you like to stay for a chocolat?
- Not in a million years.
Maybe you'd prefer something salty, then.
I can get very sweaty.
I'm going.
I just wanted your vomit.
Why'd you have to make it weird?
Eric!
I did it!
Abby Hammond, taking charge, kicking ass and talking to nobody.
Nobody's here.
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
- I know this might seem a bit forward.
- Did you follow me home?
Every day, there are moments we let pass - Get outta here, you creep!
- Moments that could define - the rest of our lives.
-    You see?
They always get out.
Sheila?
I got the bile!
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
I love you and we have each other.
Everything else we can figure out What the fuck is this?
Honey!
You're home.
We're a family again.
Hi, Dad.
Don't worry, I've got everything under control.
Really?
Because through fresh eyes, it does not look great.
This man was threatening Abby.
Our kitchen looks like the inside of a shark.
Well, I admit it, it went on a little longer than necessary.
And then ten minutes after that.
Well, gee, that's not good.
Guys, great news!
The serum worked.
Sheila will never get worse than this.
Joel.
Bu Not getting worse.
I mean, that's wonderful news, isn't it?
- You got bile?
- I did!
- From this guy.
-  I vote we don't answer that.
Okay, I'm glad you got bile.
I paid $300 for mine 'cause no one called, but whatever.
And how do we know it worked?
I took samples of her tar-blood-goo.
The cells stopped deteriorating.
Wanna see for yourself?
The light's better in the bathroom.
- Smells better, too.
- So, then, this is it?
Sheila rage-killing a man, not for food, in our house, in front of our daughter that's how she's gonna be from now on?
Again, not getting worse.
- Yay!
-   It's Rick and Alondra!
Are you home?
- Oh, crap!
-  Your cars are in the driveway, so we know that you are, and you're gonna realize that later, and it's going to be awkward.
- God, they know us so well.
- I guess I'll answer the door.
Huh.
Look at that.
Not a drop of blood on my pepper mill.
Hey, Rick, Alondra.
A sheriff friend told Rick you destroyed the school principal's house, and they carted you off to the hospital, so I brought cookies.
- Oh!
- We wanted to see that you're all right.
I'm fine.
It was a misunderstanding.
I was helping him move some furniture, and it got away from us.
I don't understand.
It's nice out, isn't it?
I may get another hummingbird feeder for out here.
- Why are you not opening your door?
- Oh.
Sheila's napping.
Oh.
- We'll be quiet.
- Sorry.
She fell asleep in the hall.
- Sheila fell asleep in the hall?
- Like, on the floor?
She's just tired.
She was up late last night baking a pie, and it took longer than expected.
Plus, our kitchen's a huge mess.
Unbelievable.
If you saw it, you would not know how to process it.
Well, I should get back.
- Do you want the cookies?
- Of course.
Just leave them on the porch.
I had such a good day at the asylum.
I'm so sorry.
I helped someone.
Made me feel better about myself.
And then you come home to this.
It's my fault!
All of it.
I should never have let her out of the basement.
I'm-I'm responsible for everything.
Really?
No one's gonna argue that?
Great stuff.
Well, I'm gonna run to the store for more cleaning supplies.
And I will pay, so don't even think about it.
Okay.
- So, what now?
-  - We get Alondra's porch cookies.
-  I think what your dad meant was what to do now about me since I've become extra "kill-y".
I didn't say that.
But you wouldn't mind if I went back down to the basement.
Well, if going to the basement until we figure this out feels right to you, then you should go to the basement.
Unless someone else has another idea besides going to the basement.
But I am hearing the word "basement" a lot.
So, that's relevant.
You've been staring at the cleaning products for, like, a really long time.
Oh.
Sorry.
It's okay.
There's a lot going on in this aisle.
I wanted to make sure you weren't overwhelmed.
Sometimes I do feel overwhelmed.
Me too.
Wait.
Not just in this aisle, right?
No.
Everywhere.
Then me too.
There's just so much happening right now.
And I don't always know the right thing to do.
We all just do the best we can.
Except for Leslie, the cashier.
She's become a problem.
But do you ever feel like your best sometimes isn't enough?
Everyone does, except Leslie.
This girl I know, um, her mom's been sick, and it's gotten worse.
And I wanna help because they're like family to me, - but I never feel like I'm doing enough.
- You are.
But how can I know that, Ramona?
You'd do anything for this family, right?
Guy without a name tag?
Oh.
Eric.
And yes.
Then you're doing enough.
Here, this one's good for blood.
- How did you know I ?
- You have some on your shoes.
So, is this how it's gonna be now?
We just keep Mom in the basement and only let her out to shower and hunt?
I guess for the time being.
Mom wanted to take me shopping for a dress this week.
I don't think I need a dress.
I already have one.
I just wanna know if that's still happening.
- When I was at the asylum - Don't say "asylum".
It sounds like they sent you to the 19th century.
Okay.
When I was at the "time-out resort," I had a roommate, Ron.
Ron lost his wife a week ago, and it sent him spiraling.
He is never gonna see her again.
At least we still have your mom.
Chained in the basement.
No family is perfect.
- Oh, my God!
- What?
Finally, something wonderful is happening.
What?
Hey, there.
I got a half-mushroom, half-olive pizza, one shrimp cocktail, a side of spinach, and for Abby's lunch tomorrow I was told to say that a meatball sandwich, all for the amazing price of $35.
Here.
You can keep that.
Thank you.
And I know this will appear unprofessional, - but may I use your powder room?
- It's fine, but no.
Eh - Mom brought us food.
- She even got me a shrimp cocktail.
- She's the best.
- She really is.
- I hope we never have to kill her.
- Boy, me too.
- Hi, honey.
Did dinner come?
- It was great.
- Thank you for my shrimp cocktail.
- Of course.
Since I know you're not crazy about Japopo's, I went with Machichi's.
- I think the quality is better.
- I know, I read your Yelp review.
Here.
I know how much you like organ meat, so I brought you Goran's kidney.
Aw!
Thanks.
It's so rich.
So, how you doin'?
Great.
I was putting together a schedule for you.
- We have that open house on Tuesday.
- I'll take care of it.
And then I was going to take Abby dress shopping on Thursday.
She likes that store Debbie and Debbie's.
But you have to ask for tall Debbie because white Debbie is a cunt.
Tall Debbie.
Got it.
It's gonna be all right, sweetie.
- I know.
- It will.
We'll get a desk down here.
We can paint the walls.
Sure.
It'll be nice.
Put in some carpet.
- I'd love a longer chain.
- Totally.
Twenty, 30 feet, whatever you want.
Maybe a television.
It'll be the nicest room in the house.
- We'll make it work.
- Yeah.
Just don't give up on me.
Never.
It's a hard world to get a break in All the good things have been taken But, girl, there are ways to make Certain things pay Though I'm dressed in these rags I'll wear sable Someday Hear what I say I'm gonna ride the serpent -  -  No more time spent  You're back.
I lost you once.
That was enough.
Remember, remember It's my life and I'll do what I want It's my mind And I'll think what I want Show me I'm wrong We're not living apart.
But someday I'll treat you real fine But we should keep the chains, you know, for sex stuff.
Right on.
-  -  It's my life and I'll do what I want It's my mind And I'll think what I want Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime - But someday I'll treat you real fine - Don't eat me.
I'll try not to.
But you're so damn cute!
It's my life and I'll do what I want  Hello?
-  Eric.
- Ramona?
I hope you don't mind my calling.
No.
No, not at all.
I got your number from your rewards card.
Oh, I love that thing.
The savings really add up.
- So, how are you?
- Fine.
I was thinking about your friend with the sick mom.
Is your friend your age with strawberry-blonde hair?
- Yeah.
Abby.
Why?
- She was in yesterday.
She's pretty.
Is she your girlfriend?
No.
I'm as single as a hummingbird moth at the end of June.
They mate at the beginning of June.
I like science.
And moths.
I like science and moths, too.
Really?
What's your favorite moth?
The emperor.
Duh.
I know.
That was easy.
My boyfriend has zero interest in moths.
- Oh.
- I mean, my ex-boyfriend.
- We just broke up.
- Oh!
Um - Are you Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Although it was a little messy.
So, maybe we can hang out sometime.
Yeah.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1    Oh, good.
You're awake.
- Honey, are you okay?
-  You're breathing really fast, Mom.
I know.
This is new.
Well, as you saw yesterday, I'm a little antsy.
Anyway, I didn't want you to wake up and find me gone and worry.
I gotta go.
Go?
Do you think that's a good idea?
I don't.
Where are you going?
I don't know, but I gotta get out of here.
Sweetie, we just unchained you and you're kind of kill-happy right now.
So I'm going to have to insist -  - Okay, drive safe.
Nice.
- You could've said something.
- I just woke up.
Me, too.
Ha!
Who's my little friend?
Who's my furry little cross-training friend?
You are.
Let's go again.
I'll give you a head start.
Oh, my God, you can run and poop.
That's so cool.
You were chasing rabbits?
Yeah.
I tried jogging, but I didn't feel any better.
And then this rabbit ran out in front of me and I went after it and I was like, "Yes, this is scratching that itch".
You know what's cool?
I'm never surprised anymore.
Well, I feel like channeling my bloodlust is key to preventing something like last night's oopsie.
There's an eyelid on the light.
Oopsie.
Mmm!
So I took the container with Serbian Guy back to the storage unit.
And then I destroyed his phone and then buried his clothes in the desert.
Look at me, I'm becoming a morning person.
If this helps you be less murdery, that's great.
My concern is, if someone sees you running around snatching rabbits like a coyote in yoga pants, they might ask questions like, "What the fuck is that"?
No one's gonna see me.
I'm way out in the desert, even past where we buried Gary.
I just think you should keep a low profile until we know what's going on.
Maybe we'll get you a treadmill.
We could put a toy rabbit on a stick in front of it and you can chase that.
Well, make up your mind, Joel.
Am I a coyote in yoga pants or a greyhound at a racetrack?
He's thinking, he's thinking.
He knows he screwed up and he's going with You are my beautiful wife.
Nailed it.
Don't come at me with that weak tea.
I love you very much.
What is that supposed to mean?
She's trying to get in your head.
Don't listen to her.
Okay, when I was running, I had a thought.
I think we should go to the office today and tell Carl that we want in on that big housing development he's doing.
Or even better, we hold off for a while on seeing our boss who yells at us and whose vocal cords you might rip out and eat in front of him.
Come on, Joel.
I don't wanna lay low.
I wanna make my mark.
I wanna shake shit up.
Dream big.
My dream right now is to keep my family together and my wife out of jail.
And take apart this hammer-knife I made to kill the undead, and use the hammer portion to build bookshelves.
Then, when my workday is done, the knife to cut Brie and, perhaps, an apple.
Fine.
I'll go see Carl alone.
But if he doesn't let us in on that project, I am going to pry it out of his plump and salty fingers.
Okay, I'll come with you.
By God, I'm gonna have an apple today.
- Hi, Joel.
- Hey, Lisa.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Still no news about Dan.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That must be hard.
- Yeah.
- Hello, Joel.
You know what they say "When God closes a door, He always opens a window".
With a breathtaking view.
- Don't you start.
-  - We're still praying for Dan.
- She loves God.
He blesses everything we do.
Well, He sure made you His instrument.
Stop.
How are you doing, Joel?
I saw in the sheriff's log you trashed Principal Novak's house.
Yeah, Alondra said you told her some crazy story about trying to move furniture?
Yeah, she got that wrong.
- So, why were you there?
- I drove over in my car.
No, why were you there?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I thought you said, "How was I there"?
Which was by way of car.
- Do you not wanna tell me, Joel?
- Of course I do.
I was there to see his grandmother.
I volunteer to teach the elderly.
Oh, that's sweet.
What do you teach them?
Dancing.
Sheila, we're gonna be late!
You wrecked Principal Novak's living room by dancing?
Well, it was the salsa.
And when you dance with pasiÃ³n, as I do, sometimes things get away from you.
Salsa!
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Hi.
Joel was telling us he gave dance lessons to Principal Novak's grandmother.
Wha?
Yeah.
He's a wonderful dancer.
So you're both athletic.
I saw you coming from your run.
I was heading out for mine.
Oh.
You run?
Duh.
Check out those "getaway sticks".
Boom.
- You need to stop.
- Why don't you make me, Officer?
Well, we really should be going.
Hey, Sheila, we should go running together sometime.
Now I'm hanging out with Blondie, it'd be good to get to know you better.
I would love that.
Yeah, wouldn't that make sense?
You and Deputy Garcia getting to be friends.
Speaking of friends, is it okay if I bring Anne to dinner Tuesday night?
Don't tell me you forgot.
You canceled last time.
Shoot.
Sheila, what's that thing we have on Tuesday?
Dinner with Lisa.
And now with Anne.
Yeah.
That's what I was fishing for.
We get rid of one cop, now you bring another into our lives?
You're too impulsive.
At least let me do the talking with Carl today.
If you talk, you'll claim you're the world's fastest tap dancer.
Salsa.
Maybe neither of us should talk to Carl.
You're right, it's too dangerous.
Let's build your bookshelves.
- Really?
- No.
Drive.
We have a problem.
I got another hit on our job board listing.
Take it down.
We got the bile.
Unless you want more.
Perv.
I did take it down.
Then I realized there's an e-mail exchange between us and the Serb your mom killed.
If anyone investigates his disappearance, they could find it.
We need to access and delete e-mails on his end.
Do you have his cell phone?
- No, my mom destroyed it.
- Shit!
He didn't mention his password before your mom killed him?
Unless it was, "Ah!
Oh, my God!
Why"?
Then, no.
That's clearly not helping.
- Who's that?
- Just a friend.
Eric.
Hm?
- Eric!
- Right.
Okay.
Uh, we need to get into his apartment so we can use his computer.
Darn.
I have to miss school again.
Let's do it.
Maybe we should tell your parents.
I don't do that anymore.
Oh.
Hey, Carl.
Hey, scrumptious.
How's it going?
I'm in a fucking bad mood.
My four-year-old needs glasses and my wife can't handle it.
What do you people want?
We want to come back at a later date and tell you what we want.
Right, honey?
You're partnering with that development company on some new homes.
We should be the point people on that.
That development's on hold since Gary disappeared.
What does Gary have to do with it?
The project needs a great salesman.
That guy could sell farts to an asshole.
Well, maybe you need to have your eyes checked because you have two great salesmen standing right here.
Although, they could also be standing right here.
Come on, Carl, are you gonna give up some awesome money making opportunity, like the giant baby you look like?
Excuse me?
What she means is, you have the skin of a young person along with childlike enthusiasm.
That explains it.
Fine.
That development is high-end.
There's a house on Linden Drive that is way pricier than the shitboxes you sell.
You bring me that listing, we'll talk.
Deal.
We'll get that listing and fuck it like we're on vacation.
What she means is, we're gonna get that listing.
-  -  Hello?
Are you sure he lived alone?
He sold vomit on the Internet.
I'm pretty sure there's not a Mrs. Right.
- Let's delete the e-mails and get out.
- Okay.
Are you okay?
It was really scary.
Yeah, it must have been.
I mean, he followed me home.
He was in my kitchen.
I keep thinking about what could have happened.
Do you wanna talk about it?
I am.
Right, right.
Go on.
It really freaked me out.
I had to sleep with my parents last night.
I'm sorry, Abby.
- I should have been there.
- No, no.
You were a hero.
Your serum saved my mom.
Besides, you're here now, so  -  - Sorry.
- Let me get that.
- Okay, who keeps texting you?
It's just this girl I met at the Rite Aid last night.
- Ramona.
- Oh!
Oh, I met her.
Anyway, we kind of hit it off, and she's been texting me to hang out, so Huh.
- Is that a good "huh" or a bad "huh"?
- It's like a processing "huh".
Oh.
So, is that like a good processing "huh"?
- We're breaking and entering right now.
- Right.
-  -  Oh.
Damn it.
I can't get into his computer.
He has a touch sensor.
We need his fingerprint.
How are we gonna get his fingerprint?
- No.
- Yeah.
- Gross.
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll get the key to my parents' storage unit.
My mom loves fingers, but she says thumbs are like the ends of bread, so maybe we'll get lucky.
And of course, the living room.
This house is gonna show really well.
The laundry room upstairs.
Brilliant.
Mm.
Lot of memories.
I raised two kids here.
Well, three if you count Rachel.
Why wouldn't we count Rachel?
Let's not open the Rachel box.
Why we're not counting Rachel is your business.
- Well, there's Rachel.
-   You are my baby, you are my baby.
You're my bad baby.
You leave scratches on the front door.
You're always trying to run out of Mommy's house.
You know we can't let you go outside.
Never, never, never.
Why can't Rachel run outside?
- Because she will not wear her socks.
-  Then her paws get dirty, and I can't put 'em in my mouth and I kiss her like this mwah, mwah, mwah Just leave it.
So, you think it's okay to deny Rachel what's natural and normal to her?
You think you know what's best for my dog?
Of course not.
Honey, maybe what feels natural to Rachel isn't what's best.
If she, Rachel, runs wild, untethered, sockless, she could get into all kinds of trouble.
She might even get caught doing something unusual in the desert and get arrested.
Tsk.
You just wanna be yourself.
- That's hard sometimes, isn't it?
-  She's kissing you.
Rachel never kisses strangers.
This is a good sign.
You know what else is a good sign?
One in your yard with our faces on it saying "Just Sold".
Let's talk about what kind of price we can get for this.
Ding-dong!
Principal Residential.
Oh, shit.
We're early, I hope that's okay.
I'm Chris, she's Christa.
- Easy to remember, but if you forget - Check the tiramisu.
Ooh!
Mmm!
- What a douchey move.
- Yeah.
- We should do that.
- Yeah.
- Sheila, Joel.
How are you?
- You all know each other?
Of course we know the Hammonds.
Are you feeling better now?
Poor Sheila vomited all over brand-new textured plush carpeting at a house they were showing.
Ooh.
They had to replace the flooring under the carpet.
That's not true, Chris.
That carpet was stain-resistant, you know that.
We've known Chris and Christa since high school.
Oh.
Chris is a few years older, but we graduated at the same time.
I'll let you do the math.
Because he couldn't.
Joel and I played football against each other.
Do you remember the championship game, sport?
Chris once drove drunk.
Joel was quarterback for his team, it was the final play of the game.
Little guy drops back and throws a Hail Mary.
It was raining, the ball was wet.
That's important to know.
The ball went sideways and landed in the marching band and hit the bass drum.
Kaboom!
They say if you put that drum up against your ear, - you can still hear Joel crying.
- Mm.
Listen, Becky, a lot of people are gonna wanna sell your house, but I promise you, we are the best damn realators in town.
They're actually the only "realators" in town, the rest of us pronounce it "realtors".
Yeah, it's "realtors".
That's what she said, "realators".
Wait, I heard the difference.
But you know, it doesn't matter.
Both ways are correct.
That's not true.
One way is correct and the other is profoundly ignorant.
No, Joel's right.
You can say "realator" or "realator".
Becky, show us the kitchen and I'll slice everyone a piece of tiramisu.
Unless you pronounce it "tira-a-misu".
-  - That's funny.
Chris flipped his dad's car.
It was in the papers.
Listen, bitch.
You keep talking shit about us, and I swear to God I will drop you.
Try it and I'll kick your twat so far up your throat you'll get pregnant giving blowjobs.
Whoa!
I hate them.
- I hate how tall he still is.
- Oh, we are screwed.
No.
Becky said she's not deciding till tomorrow.
We have to win this.
We have to crush them.
- I wanna make it hurt.
- Mm.
- What?
- I like competitive Joel.
It's hot.
Better than you wanting to putter around the house.
Fuck puttering!
Fuck Chris and Christa!
Fuck tiramisu.
Hey, as long as you're fucking everything   If we did that more often, you wouldn't have to chase rabbits.
I don't think you realize the kind of energy I have now.
I don't wanna break you.
What are we gonna do about Chris and Christa?
We could kill them.
We can't solve all our problems with murder.
- How about just this problem?
- No.
We're not killing them.
Right.
We could kill one of them.
That'd be a tough call, they're both such dicks.
No, we have to do something that doesn't involve murder.
Hmm.
Boy, if you take killing off the table, we really don't have a lot of moves.
No, we really don't.
What about kidnapping?
Why don't governments do more to stop that?
Oh, hi, honey.
We were just discussing international affairs.
Last night I saw you swallow a man's tongue like an oyster.
Don't you think it's ridiculous for us to keep lying to each other?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
How was school?
It was good.
Did you see Eric?
How's he doing after last night?
While he was at Rite Aid picking up cleaning supplies, the oddly insightful girl who works there asked him out.
I think he's doing okay.
Eric's dating the Rite Aid girl?
Good for him, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
I mean, he's giggling a lot now, so, that's new.
You know, it's hard to share your best friend.
You just have to think about what makes Eric happy.
Oh, Mom.
No.
No, no, no.
I don't need life advice from people who were plotting a kidnapping.
We were brainstorming.
If the Wright brothers had you as a daughter, we'd have never conquered the sky.
-  - I thought you gave her good advice.
Put other people's needs above her own.
We should all do that.
We should all do that.
Are you talking about what happened in the bedroom?
- Because I did my level best.
- No.
We became so preoccupied with Chris and Christa, we lost sight of the client.
We need to get back to what's important to her.
Don't worry about the bedroom.
I know how hard I work you up there.
It's not work, honey.
But I could use more water breaks.
Should I carve it into a swan or a dolphin?
Wait.
I don't think you should have to do this, unless chiseling this block of creep will help you feel better.
- Thanks.
- No problem.
I worked a snow cone cart one summer, so  Hey, you should go out with Ramona.
I don't wanna be the girl who holds a friend back because they have a three-percent chance of winding up together.
And I like her.
I want you to be happy.
- Did you say a three-percent chance?
- Really?
That's all you heard?
No, I also heard you want me to be happy.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
-  - Ooh, there.
- Where?
- I think that's a thumb.
-  -  - It's stuck to his nose.
- Should I pull it apart?
- No.
We might lose the thumbprint.
- What do we do?
- So, defrost?
- I guess.
- "Poultry" or "leftovers"?
- I know it's not popcorn.
Anybody could get you a good price for this house.
So let's talk about what's really important to you.
There is a lot of love in this home.
We noticed that in the pencil marks in Kyle's room that tracked his height all those years.
And in the jungle mural you painted for Maggie in her room.
We wanna find another family that will fill this home with memories, and we promise we'll do that, if you do us the honor of making us your realators.
- Realtors.
- Both are correct.
That's lovely.
I was going to wait until tomorrow to decide, but Ding-dong!
Unbelievable.
You can't waltz into people's homes 'cause you say, "Ding-dong".
So sorry to interrupt, but we just got some great news.
We sold Johnny Depp's manager's house for above asking.
And he agreed that you can come to set and meet Johnny, who is in LA right now making a movie.
Oh, my God.
- This is unreal.
- We thought you'd like that.
We noticed half your DVDs were Johnny Depp movies.
While we were staring at Maggie's racist jungle mural.
Is there any more of that "tira-a-misu" left?
Of course.
None for you.
-  -  Where are you going?
We've been talking about doing what's best for people.
I haven't done that for you.
You need to run free, chase things.
That's really sweet, but that's what you're thinking about now?
Yes, because you need to run and chase things.
- Now.
-  - Oh, no!
-  What?
I was gathering our stuff up.
I noticed Chris left the door open, and Rachel got out.
No!
I'm on it.
Finally, a worthy adversary.
You may be faster than me, but I never tire.
Just ask my husband.
I hope we didn't overcook it.
It's really puckered.
Like it fell asleep in a bathtub.
- It worked!
- Oh, thank God.
Okay, that is the 20th text from Ramona.
Are you gonna ask her out, or what?
One day.
Right now, I'm living the fantasy of what might be, rather than the inevitable reality of me blowing it.
- And -  There.
Done.
- We don't have to go to jail.
- Yes!
Let's get out of here.
-  - Shit.
Someone's coming.
We're going to jail.
Whoa!
Who are you?
Who are you?
We're friends of Goran.
So are we.
Why are you wearing gloves?
Why are you wearing gloves?
We're teen hand models.
And we have to protect our assets from sun damage.
- Right, Charlotte?
- That's right Hank.
- Yep.
- And you?
We're wearing gloves because we're janitors on our way to our janitor jobs.
Yeah.
And we hate changing there.
Well, we're off to a photo shoot with a watch company, and as I'm sure you can imagine, they are very punctual.
Yes.
-  - Were they here for the bile?
- You heard everything I heard, Marsha.
- You think they're with us?
Hmm.
Well, based on my having the identical information you have, I don't know.
- Who were those guys?
- You heard everything I heard, Eric.
Why are we at the Rite Aid?
'Cause Ramona's in there.
And you're gonna ask her out.
- Now?
- Yeah.
She obviously wants to see you.
Just ask her to lunch or something.
- What's the worst that could happen?
-  You're right.
You only live once.
- Go on, get outta here.
- Okay.
You know, I'll always be there for you.
Don't forget, you have a defrosted thumb in your pocket.
Right.
Whew.
Okay.
If anything happens to that dog.
There's no way I left the door open.
I recall you also denied flipping your dad's car.
Look.
You got her.
- Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
- No problem.
We're "realators", ma'am.
And we have the extra syllable because we go the extra mile.
You are such a naughty girl, Rachel.
Look how dirty you are.
I'm gonna get you a wet towel and your robe.
I'll take her.
-  - No, thank you.
Joel?
Oh, yeah.
You screwed us, didn't you, half-pint?
"Half-pint"?
Dude, I'm 6'1".
And I'm 6'4", which makes me three inches taller than you.
Not tall enough to block my Hail Mary.
Booh!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
- Whoop!
- Don't spike the dog.
We got it.
We got the listing.
That's the client's signature there.
Who are you building homes with now, huh?
Us.
Bam!
Good job.
I had zero faith in you two.
But now, seeing this, I have the tiniest amount.
Careful.
We'll get cocky.
Well, get familiar with the site map.
I'll call the geologists and get them out there as soon as possible.
Congratulations, I guess.
Bring it in.
Mama wants to hold the baby.
You cut that "baby" shit out right now.
You got it.
Shall we look at our future?
I guess we're really doing this.
- Look at it.
- Yeah.
Is that where we buried Gary?
Yeah.
- Are we bad people?
- I don't think so.
A thousand square miles of desert and they're building right where we buried your first kill.
Maybe we're being punished.
Or maybe someone just has low blood sugar and should have stopped for tacos - like I suggested.
- This isn't low blood sugar.
We do a lot of things that aren't so great.
We won the listing in an underhanded way.
We lie to our neighbors.
And, of course, kill people.
We only kill bad people.
Our neighbors like us.
And I thought the way we got the listing was clever.
I don't think we're bad.
Maybe we're just bold.
Yeah, you guys are fantastic.
Holy shit!
Gary?
What did you do to me?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Well, say something!
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
He's still alive.
Okay, confirm a theory I'm working on.
Am I a severed head?
When you bit him, he must have turned.
- And we didn't kill his brain.
- We didn't know.
Okay.
So, that's a yes?
Fuck.
All this time, you've just been lying awake here in this hole?
In a pudding of my own guts.
Oh, God, that must have been awful.
Although, you did attack me.
But look what you did to me!
God, I miss gesturing.
So, what happens now?
You can't live like this, so I guess we have to kill you ?
Are you asking me?
No, I was trailing off because it's uncomfortable.
None of this is ideal, Gary.
And, clearly, mistakes were made.
But we would like to send you off with as much dignity as possible.
Would you like to hear some music?
We've got satellite radio, so we've got everything.
Sometimes too much.
Do we really need 400 channels in our car?
- I know, right?
- Okay.
Before you kill me, I do have one last request.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's not the way satellite works.
- You just get the channels.
- It's ridiculous, the amount you pay.
No, I I mean there's something I want you to do for me before I die.
Something incredibly important.
- Really?
You want us to do you a favor?
- You buried me alive.
Not knowingly.
Dirt bikers.
We should get out of here.
Okay.
We'll find somewhere to bury the rest of him, and then take him home and hear him out.
- I don't wanna take him home.
- Do you have a better idea?
God damn it.
There.
- Good as new.
- Hey, can I be in the living room?
It's kind of spooky down here.
The only reason it's spooky down here is because you're down here.
We could put you in a garden of lollipops and it would still be spooky.
So Gary, what is your request?
Well, I had a lot of time to reflect on my life while I was buried out there.
I wasn't a good person.
Hurt a lot of people, - only thought about myself.
- Blah, blah, blah.
What do you need from us, Head?
There was only one thing I ever did I was proud of.
I always took care of my niece, Kayla.
She's had a lot of bad breaks, but I was the one person in her life who always made sure she and her baby had food to eat, a roof over their heads.
That's really nice.
He assaulted you.
He's a creep.
People can be more than one thing, Joel.
Look, in my office, there's a deed to a summer house I own on Lake Michigan.
I want you to give it to Kayla so she and her little girl can get out of their crappy apartment in Long Beach, start a new life.
You do that for me, then I'll be ready to die.
I think being separated from your penis has made you a better man.
Maybe.
It certainly has given me more free time.
Please, I'm the only family Kayla has.
I can't bear her thinking that I've abandoned her.
- No, fucking - Joel?
I think we should do this.
God damn it.
But then, this is it.
We deliver the deed to his niece, and then lights out.
Absolutely.
See?
You were wondering if we were bad people.
But only good people would do a favor for the severed head of their victim.
I think at best, we're in a moral gray area.
I fed Gary.
I gave him pieces of the Serbian guy, most of which fell through his neck into the vase, but he seemed to enjoy it.
Hey, what would you think if, for the bookshelves in here, I built them out of cherry wood, like this?
Oh.
Yeah, this is nice.
And what would you think if, instead of driving 50 miles to Long Beach, we mailed that deed to Gary's niece in an envelope, like this?
We'd still be good people.
Maybe even better because our carbon footprint would be smaller.
I know, but it's Gary's last wish.
And Kayla deserves to know why she's never gonna see her uncle again.
And we owe it to her to deliver that lie in person.
I know.
I just wanted to have one normal day.
I know, things have been crazy these last few weeks, but I just feel so guilty.
Gary loved his niece, and now thanks to me, that poor girl's gonna be all alone in the world.
I get it.
I just had a different vision of what today would look like.
Well, what did you want to do, sweetheart?
Well I need a haircut.
This is insane.
And I wanted to buy wood for the bookshelves.
And there's this new Chinese place on Riverside I'd like to try.
We haven't had a date night since this all started.
You know, normal stuff.
We can go see Gary's niece and still do all of that.
I would love nothing more than to have a date night with you.
Great.
I also haven't written a restaurant review for Yelp in a long time, and my followers rely on me.
Elite status is a privilege and a burden.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping that Yelp thing would die with me.
But I know it's important to you, so I pretend I care.
Thank you.
Where's my phone charger?
Mom, did you take it with you to the basement?
Shit.
We can't let her find Gary's head.
I know.
I'm not worried about her being shocked.
- I'm just tired of her criticizing us.
- Uh, I have one.
- I'll bring it down to you.
Just hang on.
- We have to keep her out of there today.
Oh, God, but if we tell her, "Don't go into the basement," - the second we leave - She'll go to the basement.
So, what do we do?
I want you to clean the basement today.
Sure, I'll get right on that.
Is this you guys?
"Human body parts found near Rocky Peak Park".
No.
But it sure sounds like us.
God, this guy was really ripped to pieces.
Think there's someone out there like you?
Let's not make everyone's problems our problems.
People get ripped to pieces all the time.
- No, they don't.
- They do for the purpose of my argument.
We have a lot on our plate, let's not go looking for more.
It really makes you wonder, though.
Who could've killed this poor guy?
Thank you for taking me to lunch.
It was fun.
Thank you for inviting me back to your apartment, where you live by yourself with the bed and everything.
You know, I still feel bad you didn't eat anything.
Was Panda Express a bad choice for a first date?
- Yes.
- Cool.
But also, I just wasn't hungry.
There are a million things I wanna do to you.
There's a million things I've had done to me.
But I did all of them myself.
Actually, it's just one thing a million times.
Can I have some water?
I'll get you that water.
Jesus Christ, it's happening.
Okay.
Oh.
Stay calm, Eric.
Dumber people than you do this successfully all the time.
Wake up, old friend, your days of leisure are over.
Fuck me.
Hey, Romeo.
I don't have time for gentle ribbing.
I'm in Ramona's bathroom.
She's undead.
I think she brought me here to kill me.
- Oh, my God.
Run!
- I can't, she's right outside.
Okay, uh, lock the bathroom door.
What's her address?
I'll be right there.
34 Sunbird, apartment 2D.
Hurry!
And don't take McBean.
It's a parking lot at this hour.
If I were you, I'd get on Magic Mountain Parkway - and go all the way to Rose - Eric, I'll find it!
Oh, God.
I should've brought more protection.
I'm sorry that we're not gonna make it back in time for your hair appointment.
It's all right.
It's not your fault.
There was traffic on the 405.
I just don't understand why people slow down to look at a mattress.
Well, it was brand-new and it had a cowboy boot next to it.
It invites questions.
If we hurry, we can still make the lumberyard and get Chinese food on the way back.
Unless the other cowboy boot shows up and fucks us.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Kayla Lawson?
- Yes?
We're John and Wendy Darling.
We called earlier.
Yeah, you have some news about my Uncle Gary?
Is he okay?
You know Gary.
No matter how bad things get, he always comes out ahead.
- We're doing that now?
- No, I'm done.
Okay.
Really?
So Uncle Gary just dropped everything and left?
He said he loves you very much, but he needed to change his life.
So he gave up all of his material possessions, and moved to a remote village to help the poor.
- I wonder why he didn't call.
- Great question.
Because he gave up all of his possessions, so obviously he doesn't have his phone.
Great answer.
- Did he say where he was going?
- I'll take this one.
I think it was Guatemal No, he kept it vague because he didn't want anyone to find him.
Yeah, that's better.
For everyone.
Holy shit.
Well, good for Uncle Gary.
See, I always thought that he would just grope the wrong woman one day and she'd kill him.
- Nothing could be further from the truth.
- Nothing.
Anyway, he wanted to make sure you were taken care of.
So he asked us to give you this.
It's a deed to a house in Michigan.
Six acres on a lake.
All paid for and all yours.
Oh, my God.
I spent the summers here when I was little.
See, my parents are divorced, so these are some of the happiest memories that I have.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
And thank you for driving all the way down here just to give this to me.
You are such good people.
Thank you, Kayla.
We're trying to be.
Sometimes we do things we're not proud of, and to balance the moral scales - You're welcome.
- You're right, that's better.
Fuck!
Fuck you, Uncle Gary!
And fuck you, nice people.
You've given me this gift and now I can't even use it.
Kayla, what is it?
It's this guy, Boone.
I was dating him for a couple weeks, and he's pissed because I broke up with him.
And he has my car.
He won't give it back.
I can't live on a lake in the middle of nowhere without a car!
Now I woke the baby.
Does it feel like we've done enough?
I think we may have done enough.
Joel, it was Gary's last wish that we get her to Michigan.
And we haven't done that yet.
We have to go and get her car back.
I know.
It just the cherry wood I wanted is on sale, and it's a very fast moving wood.
I guess we could just get pine.
The Toyota Camry of the forest.
We are doing a good thing, honey.
And you are gonna get your Chinese food, I promise.
Listen, Kayla, if you give us the address to your ex-boyfriend, we will go there and get your car back.
Oh, my God.
Really?
Thank you so much.
Here's his address.
You guys, I really appreciate it.
Really.
-  Of course.
- It's our pleasure.
You know, I should probably warn you about my ex.
- Warn us?
- Uh You'll probably be okay.
Thank you.
- Well, that felt good, didn't it?
- Yeah.
Except for the ominous part at the end.
Oh, you noticed that, too?
Wow.
That was awesome.
Your nose is bleeding.
That happens sometimes when I get excited.
My cat did that once.
Your tongue is way softer.
Eat this, bitch!
Oh.
Oh, she didn't attack you.
You had sex.
Thrice.
Didn't occur to you to text me an update?
Mmm, no, it really didn't.
Hey, befor you judge me, you took almost 40 minutes to get here when you thought I was gonna die.
Look, putting on my mom's kill-suit was a whole big thing, and then traffic was a nightmare.
You took McBean, didn't you?
Yeah, yes.
That's a good look on you.
Thank you.
- Are you really undead?
- Uh-huh.
- Did my mom bite you?
- No.
- Then how did it happen?
- I don't know.
I woke up one morning, vomited, died, then went on a hike, a jogger yelled at me to get out of his way, and I smashed his head in with a rock and ate his brain.
Why do joggers think they own the road?
It makes me so mad.
You're so supportive.
- Okay, you guys are are good.
-  Wait.
We met at the Rite Aid.
You said your mom was sick.
How is she?
She's doing better.
Why?
I wanted to see if she's having the same problem as I am.
- Oh, my God.
-  Jesus.
It came off a week ago.
I Velcroed it back on.
Don't worry, babe.
I can help you.
Maybe he's not so bad.
He has a bird bath.
He's inviting birds to come and play on his front lawn.
We have a hummingbird feeder and we kill people.
I'm just saying, you can't always judge a person by their aviary accessories.
Yeah?
- Boone Tarver?
- Yeah.
I'm Hume Cronyn and this is my wife, Jessica Tandy.
We're friends of Kayla, and we'd really like it if you'd consider giving her her car back.
It would be the right thing to do, and as a bird bath owner, I know you're always looking for ways to help others.
Fuck that shit.
Even if Kayla was a beautiful bird, I wouldn't give that bitch her car back.
What if we gave you $400?
Yeah, okay.
Wow.
Okay.
That was fast.
Would you do it for 300?
- No, that's not how it works.
- Okay.
I wasn't sure if you knew that.
I tell you what, you seem like nice white people.
You pay me cash, I'll do it for 350.
Really?
Okay.
Come on in.
Um, he said, "nice white people," right?
Maybe he said, "Nice right people".
Like, we do things properly.
I heard "white," but maybe.
Yeah, make yourselves comfortable.
I'll get the keys.
Great.
Thanks, Boone.
All right, I'll drive the car back to Kayla's house, and you can pick me up.
And by 8:00 p.m., you are gonna be balls deep in bok choy.
- I promise.
- Thank you.
Wow, look at those bookshelves.
Looks like he built them himself.
What the fuck?
Cherry wood.
And look at these corners.
I guarantee you this guy has his own miter saw.
Whoa.
Didn't notice that.
Tongue and groove.
God, I respect a man who's unafraid to embrace the past.
What the hell?
- Jesus.
- The chances these are all gifts seem slim.
This is what Kayla was warning us about.
Boone is a Nazi.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Remember when we were looking for our first person to kill, and we said, "Who would be the perfect candidate"?
- Yeah.
- Get the tarps out of the car, baby.
Because we just found our young, single Hitler!
Okey-dokey.
It'll take a few minutes to prepare the serum.
Why don't you have a seat right here and relax.
You'd make a really good receptionist at a medical or dental office.
Thank you.
And your calm and dispassionate demeanor would make you a wonderful 911 operator.
Thank you.
I like how we're already finding little ways to validate each other.
I could get used to this.
Right.
Okay.
Hey, isn't Ramona great?
I was so worried my first time would be with my cousin, Sophie.
She gives such good massages.
But now instead of doing something creepy and desperate - You're having sex with a dead woman.
- Undead.
You know, I always thought my obsession with the supernatural would hurt my chances with girls, but really - it was just preparing me for my deflowering.
- Why stop there?
Maybe you could have a threesome with a mermaid and a hobbit.
Are you okay?
You seem a little hostile.
I'm fine.
Let's just finish this serum so your girlfriend's head doesn't fall off when you're porking her.
Well, for your information, I recently found out I'm a gentle, giving lover.
I don't wanna kill this guy.
We talked about this, honey.
We can't keep murdering people impulsively.
But there's no one here.
And this is a truly bad guy who's responsible for killing millions of people.
- Indirectly.
- No.
- Why not?
- Because I gave up my haircut Because I gave up my haircut and I gave up my cherry wood.
And there's no scenario where we kill this guy and I still get Chinese food.
- Oh!
There he is.
- Sorry it took so long.
I popped a couple of Oxys before you came and they just kicked in, - so I'm moving kind of slow.
- He's moving kind of slow.
- I don't care.
- My whole body's numb.
I shit you not, I slammed my finger in the door, I felt nothing.
- He feels nothing.
- I don't care.
Hey, you guys like fun, right?
There's a funeral down the street for a gay, Jew lady-doctor.
You wanna go shout stuff at her colored foster kids?
Jesus.
He's perfect.
- Thank you.
- Not tonight.
- But I just wanna eat this gentleman now.
- Did you just say you wanna No, you're high.
You misheard me.
We can go get Chinese food another time.
- It's always another time.
- But I'll be quick.
I promise.
-  - Hey, Boone.
Bad news.
Oh, shit.
They moved that funeral to yesterday.
Shifty Jews.
I told the crew that we'd just all hang out here tonight.
Who are you?
We were just leaving.
Right, sweetheart?
Yes.
Whoa.
You ain't going nowhere.
Not until you buy raffle tickets for our softball team.
- No, we need to skedaddle.
- Oh, hang on.
You guys have a whole team?
Are you all Nazi-ish?
Damn right.
You like Nazis?
I don't know, I've never had one.
- Maybe you should try one sometime.
- Oh, I definitely will.
- I'll take this whole book.
- Awesome.
- Hundred bucks.
- You play ball, Hume?
- We're looking for a white fielder.
- Wait.
Did you say "white" fielder?
Right.
Wait.
"Right" like yes, you need a white fielder, or "right" like no, you need a right fielder?
- What?
- Honey, let's go.
Yeah, I'm done here.
Okay.
Holding still, holding still.
I'm releasing the serum into your spine, almost there, your hair smells great.
Taking the needle out And it snapped off inside you.
How do you feel?
- Fine.
- Let's just leave it there.
Okay, remember, this isn't a cure.
It just arrests your symptoms.
- So you're gonna stay exactly as you are.
- Which is awesome.
Okay.
I have to be at work in ten minutes.
Thanks for helping me.
Wait.
Before you leave, tomorrow night's half-price at the trampoline park.
- You wanna go?
- No.
- Okay.
How about a movie Friday night?
- No.
Magic Mountain on Saturday?
- No.
- No.
Wow, look at us, already on the same page.
I think she's blowing you off.
I suspected Abby's "sick" mother was undead, and thought she might be able to help me with my deterioration.
The only reason I slept with you was to create an emotional bond so you'd lead me to her.
But now you've fallen for me?
I think your dignity also snapped off inside her.
Sorry, Eric.
I got the serum, and I don't need you anymore.
We had some fun, but I'm kind of a loner.
See ya later, alligator.
Or maybe never again, crocodile.
- Wow.
-  When my parents find out there's another undead person, they're gonna freak out.
How are you feeling?
Not great.
I shouldn't have given you such a hard time about Ramona.
No.
No, it's okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't stop talking about her.
I wasn't trying to make you jealous.
I wasn't jealous.
I was angry.
- Angry?
- Yeah, you scared the hell out of me.
When you called me from Ramona's, I thought you were gonna die.
I'd never see you again.
I'm sorry.
Don't ever do that to me again.
I won't.
I should clean the basement.
I promised my parents.
Yeah, I should get home.
- Hey, thanks for everything.
- Thank you.
Yup, yup.
-  - Mm.
I'm sorry I was so insistent on killing Boone.
You know, being selfless doesn't come easy to the undead.
Hey, we made it here, we're having our date night.
I am in pork heaven.
Mm.
You know what's great about a lobster tank?
Hmm?
You have a stockpile of live, fresh, tasty food whenever you want it.
Well-observed.
This is my lobster tank.
And these gentlemen are my lobsters.
And whenever I get hungry, we can just reach in and grab one, and have a tasty meal.
Wow, Nazi-lobsters.
That's intense.
But actually, right now, I'd just like to enjoy my meal.
Have one normal evening with normal conversation.
Of course.
It's just that if we know who we're gonna kill next, then we can plan better, and have more time for non-murder-y things.
But, yes, normal conversation.
Look at that.
What a beautiful fish.
You know the food's authentic when they serve the fish with the head on.
Speaking of, now that we've dealt with Kayla, - we have to kill Gary's head tomorrow.
- That's right.
How should we do that?
Well, the weather has been great.
Something outside would be nice.
We could take him to Pike's Ridge.
Set him on that boulder overlooking the valley, tell him a joke, and while he's laughing, drive an ice pick through his brain.
Oh, that's good.
I was thinking we'd count to three, but then do it on two.
But your way is better.
I'm sorry.
I'm doing it again.
You wanted normal conversation.
No, it's okay.
Maybe for us, this is normal.
God, I know we have to kill Gary now, but how great would it be - to put him out for Halloween.
- Oh, my God!
And we could make the Anderson's corn maze look like the bullshit that it is.
- No, we have to kill him tomorrow.
- Absolutely.
And the crowd goes wild.
Go, go!
Go, go!
Gary!
Gary!
You're the best!
God, ladies and gentleman, please, you got to settle down, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, Detroit.
- "You're in Michigan".
- Welcome, Michigan!
Acoustics in here are not bad.
Hey!
What's up?
I'm Gary.
Not today.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Nice.
Oh, it is a good thing we moved Gary because the geologist at the project site seems pretty sharp, and I think she would've noticed a talking head.
I, too, have news.
I've broken ground on our bookshelves.
Oh.
Seems perfect.
And I got the last of the cherry wood at the lumber yard.
Met a guy in the parking lot who offered to build them for 50 bucks, but I said, "No, sir, I need to do this myself, and you are not wearing shoes".
Mm.
I'm thinking about this for the design.
Those are the bookshelves in the Nazi's house.
- You wanna build Nazi bookshelves?
- The bookshelves weren't Nazis.
If anything, those shelves were Nazi-occupied.
Mm, okay.
So, you wanna take a break and go kill Gary?
Sure, I could take a break.
Great, and then I can go grocery shopping for our dinner with Lisa, and you can spend the rest of the day building your Nazi bookshelves.
Perfect.
And maybe we just call them "bookshelves".
That might be hard.
When we returned her car, Kayla was so excited.
She can't wait to get to Michigan and start her new life.
And her baby is so adorable.
-  - So cute.
I could eat her with a spoon.
- I would never eat her with a spoon.
- Oh, Hailey.
Look at her.
She's growing up so fast!
She's gonna be taller than me soon.
She already is.
- So, wow, closure!
Isn't that great?
- I love it.
So, we have a few thoughts on your "departure".
There's a beautiful overlook at the top of Pike's Ridge that we sometimes hike to.
Yeah, we could lay you down in a meadow of wildflowers.
And as the butterflies say goodbye to the morning dew So, too, will we say farewell to Gary West.
- Yeah, I don't wanna do that.
- Well, we know you also like porn.
You could watch a few girls go at it for a while, and we could shoot you in the back of the head.
There are no wrong choices.
- No, I don't want to die at all.
- What?
But But Hey, hang on.
Hey.
What I think Joel is saying is, "But But Hey, hang on.
Hey.
You said if we gave the deed to Kayla, you'd be ready to go".
I've been thinking about it, and I want to live to see Kayla turn her life around.
I want to see Hailey grow up.
You're a talking head in a flower vase.
Still better looking than you, buddy!
- Not in a swimsuit.
- Guys!
How do you have so much testosterone without balls?
She asked you a question, Joel.
I say we open a window, put him on the sill, and crack him like a walnut.
I feel like my life could still have meaning.
Put an iPad in front of me.
I can follow Kayla's life on Instagram and Facebook.
Look, I know we didn't shake on this deal, but we had an agreement.
If you guys want to kill me, I can't stop you.
I mean, it is two against one.
All I'm saying is, I don't wanna die.
He doesn't want to die.
I know, but we can't keep a head in our basement forever.
I know, but we can't kill him if he's begging us not to.
- I know!
- So, we're on the same page.
- The same shitty page.
- Then why are we fighting?
We're not fighting.
We're having a heated agreement.
Good morning, adults.
How am I?
Well, something happened yesterday you might wanna know about.
What was it?
I met another undead person.
Oh, crap.
You found Gary.
Yes.
And, boy, way to keep it interesting, guys.
But I was actually talking about the girl who dated Eric for five minutes.
- Ramona.
- What?
Ramona?
Rite Aid girl is undead?
How's that even possible?
- Did you bite her?
- No!
I don't just run around biting people.
I've never even met her.
- Well, if you didn't bite her - Then how did she get sick?
Oh, my God!
If we find out what you two have in common We might finally understand what happened with me.
I know!
And figure out how this all started!
I know!
And see if other people have it!
I know!
- It could be spreading.
- That's what I'm saying.
Then why does it feel like we're still fighting?
Yeah, that's weird.
We have to talk to Ramona.
- Any idea where she lives?
- Yeah.
- I can take you there.
- No, give us the address.
- You need to go to school.
- Seriously?
Guys, come on.
- Include me.
- Your mother's right.
One person in this family should have a normal life.
Not totally normal.
Someone's getting chocolate milk in their lunch today.
- Ooh.
- Fine, I'll go to school.
Oh, can I ask one question about the head in our basement?
- Sure.
- What the fuck?
Well, Gary was the first person I sampled, and we didn't know we had to kill the brain.
Destroying the brain is literally the one thing that everybody knows about the undead.
You were there when we buried him!
I didn't see you picking up a stake!
-  - Yeah.
Maybe we make Gary's life so unpleasant he wants to die.
Well, we already took his body away.
What are we gonna do?
Stop brushing his teeth?
You brushed his teeth?
We don't want that hole in his cheek to get any bigger.
Anyway, I'm sorry you didn't get back to your bookshelves.
- I could've talked to Ramona myself.
- No, I should be here.
Besides, if this is the rise of the undead and the end of humankind, - we may not need bookshelves.
- Yeah, well, I'll still wanna read.
-  -  Hi, Ramona.
Do you remember me?
I'm Joel.
And this is my wife, Sheila.
Hello, Sheila.
It's nice to finally meet you.
It's great to meet you, Ramona.
Here, let me help you with that.
We just wanted to talk to you about - Jesus Christ.
- No, thank you, I'm not religious.
There are body parts in here.
Yeah, that's my lunch.
Why don't we go inside?
- Hey, Eric.
How you holdin' up?
- I'm okay.
No, I'm not.
I'm really bummed about Ramona.
- Yeah, I'm sorry that happened to you.
-  So, my parents freaked out when I told them about her.
They're going to her apartment.
Really?
To tell her she never should've dumped me?
Sure.
I love your parents.
Your dad's the best.
You've been out of school a couple days.
You ready to be here?
Honestly, everything's been so intense.
There is a talking head in my basement.
Tell you about that later.
I'm actually looking forward to a day without any life-and-death issues.
Abby, you're here.
Thank God.
There is a crisis.
Cindy tore her shorts while twerking to win this bet, and now she has nothing to wear to gym.
And Talia definitely has an extra pair, but she is being a total cunt about it.
Well, Sarah, everything's gonna be fine 'cause I have an extra pair of shorts in my locker.
Oh, my God.
You are literally saving her life.
Feel like I'm on vacation.
- So, how long have you been like this?
- About three weeks.
Same with me.
Great!
And what did you do in the days before you turned?
Maybe there's something you two have in common.
It was pretty uneventful.
I went to the dry cleaners.
- Me too.
Which one?
- Manny's.
Oh, we go to Chazz's.
They're good with denim, and - they serve hot dogs.
- What else?
Uh I dropped a pumpkin off of a roof with my cousin.
- What else?
- I saw a cloud that looked like Charlie Brown, but my friend didn't think so.
I once saw a cloud that looked like Snoopy.
- That's fun.
- I don't see this helping.
Come on, Ramona.
Where did you go where you might've been exposed to a virus?
The day before I got sick, I went to my former job as an auctioneer.
- You were an auctioneer?
- Why?
Did you go to an auction?
No, it's just really hard to picture.
I had a natural gift for it.
The high energy, the rapid-fire musicality of the presentation.
It was very exciting.
I hated it.
I always dreamed of being a slower, duller person, but was never brave enough to make it happen, until now.
I always wanted to be bolder, and now I am.
And Loki was a criminal, and he wanted to be folk singer.
- And Gary - Is an asshole.
Who wants to be a better person.
By dying, we get to be the people we've always wanted to be.
- I like who I am now.
- Me too.
I don't care how it happened.
Why do you?
Because you're eating human flesh, and I just don't think a lot of people should be running around doing that.
I used to be high-strung and judgy like you.
You need to relax.
- Sheila, would you like some jogger?
- Where did you get that guy?
Rocky Peak Park.
That's where I get all my joggers.
So, you're the one that killed the guy there last week.
You left half a body behind.
You have to take all the pieces with you, Ramona.
Otherwise, it attracts attention, and that's bad for all of us.
But people have so many parts.
I know, it's hard.
I would've been caught a long time ago if I didn't have Joel to help me.
But you don't have a Joel, so you have to be a little more careful.
I have a question for you.
- Did you ever throw up a red ball?
- Yes.
Wasn't that weird?
- Where do you keep yours?
- In the freezer.
The freezer?
Doesn't it get lonely?
Lonely?
- Oh, my God!
- What the fuckity-fuck is that?
Your ball grew legs?
I left it on a counter for a few days, and when I came back, it had legs.
I call it "Mr. Ball Legs".
I'm ready to go home.
Ooh, tater tots!
Oh, no, someone touched this one.
Ugh, Christian posted about Janie again.
What's going on?
It's honestly so sad.
Okay.
So, Janie and Christian got into a fight at Meghan-with-an-H's party, right?
And then he breaks up with her in front of everyone.
And then he hooks up with Chess Club Megan in the media room.
Janie sent him, like, a million texts begging him to take her back, and now he's posting screenshots of all her texts online.
Could you imagine?
I mean, I would literally die.
Wow, that's really shitty.
Janie cried yesterday in history class.
Such a pretty crier.
So pretty.
Oh, my God, he just posted another one.
Someone should do something.
- You're right.
I'm gonna unfollow him.
- Totally.
Mr. Whetherton, there's smoke coming from a trash can outside.
Goddamn it!
Well, thank you for putting that responsibility on me.
Hey, let me get that for ya.
- Hey, Christian.
What's up?
-  Hey, Janie, how's it going?
Oh, no, someone touched this one.
Yeah, that's not me.
Guess who's here!
Sweetie, that's your cue.
- Ramona?
- Look who couldn't resist my delicious boy.
Hey, Eric.
Oh, you can kiss in front of me.
It's okay.
Mom.
Please.
- Go.
- Oh.
I'll be downstairs with headphones on.
They're noise-canceling.
- All noises.
- Oh, God.
I'm sorry about my mom.
She's a little nervous.
This is a big deal for her.
That's okay.
So, what have you been up to?
Nothin'.
I've just been lying here, successfully throwing a ball up and down.
- What are you doing here?
- I decided I need you back in my life.
Really?
That sounds great!
I may never let you go.
That sounded less great.
There's no legs on my ball.
Or Loki's.
There's gotta be something in this Serbian book.
You'd think spider monsters would be worthy of their own chapter.
Maybe I'll defrost my ball and see what happens.
Do not defrost it.
This was inside of me, Joel.
My body, my ball, my choice.
Please, God, if I win one argument this year, let it be this one.
Fine, I won't thaw it out.
Unless you keep telling me I can't.
What are we gonna do about Ramona?
We can't have her leaving bodies around.
I know.
Do you think we'll have to?
- I don't want to kill her.
- Good.
Me neither.
She's, like, Abby's age.
Plus, she's the only one at that drugstore who gives a damn about customer satisfaction.
Maybe we could teach her.
We could have her tag along when we go kill our first Nazi.
I don't know, honey.
We've got a lot on our plate.
I don't wanna be opening up a finishing school for the undead.
-  Whoa!
- Oh, my God!
That knight has Mr. Ball Legs on his shield.
-  What does it mean?
-  I don't know.
- Is he a knight that fights the undead?
- Or is he an undead knight?
Whoa.
Either way, it's terrifying.
I realize it's not their fault, but fucking Serbia!
Other than tennis players, has anything good come out of that country?
-  -  I'm home!
You were doing something.
- I swear to God, every time.
- Mm-mm.
- Hey, Abby, how was school?
- Normal, just like you wanted.
Hey, didn't you guys invite Lisa for dinner tonight?
You know, to make up for you killing her husband, and this one eating him?
- Oh, God, we completely forgot!
- We have to cancel.
We can't.
This was the dinner to make up for the last one we canceled.
Mm, if you cancel again, it might look like you don't know what you're doing.
We know, Abby, we're bad at everything because we're your parents.
No, it's because prior to this, you led a mindlessly happy suburban existence, which left you fundamentally unprepared to deal with the life-and-death decisions that now plague your every waking moment.
- Jesus.
- Don't listen to her.
I'll defrost a frozen lasagna.
Can you go down to the basement and grab a bottle of wine?
- And a soup from the earthquake kit.
- Okay.
But just sometime, I'd like one day to go as planned.
Tomorrow, I promise.
All bookshelves, all day.
Sure, tomorrow.
- I'm sorry I broke Dad.
- Oh, it's not your fault.
Between Ramona and Mr. Ball Legs, he's had a big day.
- Mr. Who Legs?
- Set the table, sweetie.
So have you and Sheila come to any conclusions about my future?
Not yet, Gary.
Damn it!
All we have is tomato soup.
You can't serve tomato soup with lasagna.
It's just not done!
You all right?
I see a man that needs to talk.
I'm fine.
All I wanted to do the last couple days was build bookshelves.
But who am I kidding?
With Sheila's situation, I'm never gonna do normal things again.
Yeah.
Her change has had a big effect on me too.
Ask me how.
No, I see that.
Look, you two are awesome, really.
You listen to each other.
You make decisions together.
I've never had that.
I may never have it.
Dude, you don't know that.
You could, uh - Anyway, I interrupted you.
- Sure, Sheila's got a lot going on.
Her life's always gonna be bigger than yours.
It's like It's like being married to the Queen of England.
- It's not exactly like that.
- You got two ways of looking at it.
Either it's, "My needs are always gonna come second" or "Jesus Christ, I'm fucking the Queen of England".
Appreciate what you have, buddy.
Stop trying to turn it into something it's never gonna be.
Thank you, but we're having dinner guests, so I gotta put you in the cabinet, stuff a sock in your mouth.
- Understood.
- Okay.
- Ramona!
- Hi.
Where are Anne and Lisa?
Oh, my mom's finishing making her famous nine-layer dip, and Anne had a church thing.
But Ramona's back in my life forever!
You guys are together again?
Uh-huh.
In fact, Ramona here wants me to go later with her to kill someone.
-  What?
- She said she wants me to be her Joel.
Does that ring any bells for anyone?
- Joel?
- No.
We just went over today and told her she has to be more careful.
Yeah, and that we realize how much harder she has it because she's all alone.
And doesn't have anyone to help her clean up and carry bodies, like I do for Sheila.
- Okay, I see what happened.
- I hear it too.
- Ramona, you can't just take Eric.
- Why not?
He's perfect.
He's little, so if he tries to run, I can catch him.
Then I'll do something small but memorable to his legs so he won't try it again.
Hear that, everyone?
Does everyone hear what's happening right now?
Excuse me.
- I need to check on the lasagna.
- I'll come with you.
- No.
- No, you're right.
Too many cooks.
- What are you doing?
- I'm fucking the Queen of England!
-  What?
- It's an expression.
It means no more looking back.
I'm all in.
I don't know how you got there, but I dig where you're at.
Hammer-knife's ready.
Let's save the boy.
Okay, Abby, you go to your room and stay there.
No way!
Eric's my friend.
I pushed him into this relationship.
This time, I go with you.
Okay, but if things go south, you grab Eric and stay behind us.
- You understand?
- Yes.
- Abby.
- I understand.
You guys ready?
- Ready.
- Not quite.
Let's do this.
I was thinking maybe we'd move to Seattle.
Joel was right.
Two people killing in the same town draws too much attention.
Plus, I love the Seahawks.
Oh, God, you're into sports?
This relationship is getting even more untenable.
Ramona, we need to talk.
I know how hard it must be for you to live like this on your own, but if Eric doesn't want to go with you, it's not gonna work.
Let me tell you about this guy.
He is not gonna be good at hunting people.
He gets queasy.
He's panicky.
- His orthotics squeak when he runs.
- Hey.
- You know I love you, man.
- Really?
Then I'll bite him, and he'll want to hunt with me.
I'm not leaving without him.
Well, then I guess you're not leavin'.
Sorry!
Oh, the seventh layer of my nine-layer dip is always such an asshole.
It's sour cream, and it always wants to settle into the olives, which are layer six.
I used to separate them with pimentos.
I don't know why I stopped doing that.
Oh, right.
Because Dan didn't like pimentos.
God, I do not miss him.
Oh, fuck me, I forgot the chips!
I'm so spacey, and I'm not even high.
By the way, if you are high, that dip is what you're gonna wanna eat, Joel.
What's going on?
Eric why aren't you standing next to your girlfriend?
She's not gonna bite.
Oh!
What a cute, weird couple you two make.
I'll be back.
Lasagna's done.
-  -  -  -  No!
-  -  - Abby?
- You wanted me to have a normal life?
This is it.
This is who I am now.
I'm the fucking Queen of England.
Okay, that's not the expression.
And tomorrow, we're gonna have a talk about this whole thing.
- Ramona, it's over.
Just give up.
- But I want a Joel!
And not just to hunt with.
I want what you two have.
I don't want to do this alone anymore.
Oh, sweetie.
Well, you can't just grab someone off the street and have what we have.
- Why not?
-  Because Joel and I built a life together.
We spent 20 years learning to care for each other.
And lately, I've done nothing but bring chaos to his life.
And does he complain?
Often.
But that's okay 'cause he's given up so much for me.
But when you love someone, that doesn't matter.
Because it's not about what you give up, it's about what you get.
And I don't complain that much.
So, I guess if I'm gonna find my Joel, the relationship should be built on more than just hurting his leg.
- That's right.
- I've got chips!
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Ramona broke up with me.
And I am very upset.
Given the circumstances, I think we should reschedule dinner.
Which, I think we can all agree, is different than canceling.
Dear Eric, I'm moving to Seattle, where perhaps someday I will meet my Joel.
I can't take Mr. Ball Legs on a plane because of 9/11, so I'm leaving him behind.
Please ask the Hammonds to take care of him.
I left the key under the mat.
of my neighbor because it seemed too obvious to leave it under mine.
Good luck, Eric.
X-O-X-O.
Surfing man emoji.
Ramona.
Maybe this could be Gary's pet.
So, we're keeping Gary?
It felt good not to kill Ramona.
I like not killing people.
I've always liked it.
I just forgot how much.
You're sweet.
I'll look for a shopping bag to put this thing in.
Well, now that Ramona's gone, how are we gonna find out what killed both of us?
There's gotta be a link.
Are you sure you didn't go to any auctions?
I think I would remember.
And I can't imagine how something like this would spread through an auction.
I don't know.
Maybe an infected medieval goblet or a cursed piece of movie memorabilia?
I didn't go to an auction.
I didn't.
Hon, didn't we eat at Japopo's two nights before you got sick?
- Yeah.
- Would that have been on a Friday?
- Yeah.
- And didn't you have the clam special?
Yeah.
Why?
So did Ramona.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Boone may be a Nazi, but he's very kind to birds.
Are you having second thoughts about killing him?
No, we're almost out of the Serb guy.
And Boone idolizes Hitler.
The Hitler.
Gonna eat this bastard tits to teeth.
- "Tits to teeth"?
- It's an expression.
- It means to eat all of something.
- No, baby, not that I've heard.
- "Gums to thumbs"?
- Sure.
Do you see a way for us to get the body out?
Well, it's gonna be tough.
There's no alley, there's a lot of foot traffic, and there's a 7-Eleven on the corner, so night's not gonna be any better.
Killing people is hard.
I used to think that was a good thing.
They're opening up Japopo's.
I gotta go.
What's your plan?
I'm gonna get their receipts and find out if anybody else ordered the clams the same night as you and Ramona.
If they did, I'll track them down.
And if they turned, we'll know it was the clams.
Then, I'll try to save humanity, tits to teeth.
Well, I heard it somewhere.
Mm-hmm.
But what's your plan to get the receipts?
You're not gonna pretend you're a health inspector, are you?
No.
But why would that be bad?
Because they would ask for ID.
Right.
We had the same reason.
You're hanging out in the walk-in freezer?
- Don't do it.
- Hello.
I'm a documentary filmmaker working on a movie about tipping in the restaurant industry.
I was recently in England where they don't tip at all.
So that's been interesting.
A whole documentary on tipping?
It may expand to other areas.
Race.
Ageism.
What have you.
Angels.
Oh, my wife loves angels.
She once thought she saw one in Yosemite.
Incredible.
I might want to interview her on camera.
That'd be great.
Done.
In the meantime, I'd love to see your receipts from the past three weeks.
I guess that'd be okay.
I mean, it's for my wife's movie, right?
You wrote a scathing Yelp review about us.
My cook recognized you from your picture.
Yes, I did.
Would your wife be available for an interview tomorrow?
You need to write me a better review.
The thing is, I have Yelp Elite Member status.
So the integrity of my reviews You know what?
I'll write you a good review.
No, no, no, not on your phone, Mr. Integrity.
Put some time into it.
Come back tonight.
If I like it, I'll give you the receipts.
Fine.
But people like you are the reason documentary filmmaking is dying in this country.
- Sheila.
Sheila - Mm-hmm?
Yeah?
Time!
I gotta get to work, girlie.
You're fun to spar with.
You hit for, like, 20 minutes.
You're not even tired.
I have a lot of energy lately.
I gave up dairy.
Again tomorrow?
- Yeah, sure.
Gotta keep in shape.
- I can imagine so, being a sheriff.
What?
Oh, no.
We mostly just sit in a car all day.
I was talking about Lisa.
She's a very physical and energetic lover.
I'm beginning to think she killed Dan.
- We're dating, by the way.
- Oh, well, congratulations.
Speaking of Dan, any news on the investigation?
Nope.
But a lot of people have gone missing from Santa Clarita lately.
- Too many, if you ask me.
- Is anyone asking you?
No.
I suggested we start a task force to see if any of these disappearances are connected, but my boss won't listen to me.
I'm just a deputy.
Wow.
Frustrating.
Sounds like a lost cause.
You should let that go.
Focus more on you.
What makes Anne happy?
Christ's infinite love.
Yeah, He's great.
What else?
I like to paint.
Well, put your energy into that!
What else?
I like gardening.
Well, then you should grow some flowers, put them in a vase and paint that shit.
What else?
- I love solving mysteries.
- Next!
You know what, you're right, Sheila.
I'm gonna do what I want and I'm gonna look into these missing people myself and see if there's a connection.
No.
You should plant and paint.
You'll be too tired for anything else.
Not if I quit dairy, like you.
You are so inspiring.
I'll get you a bonsai tree.
That's gardening and art.
Fuck.
"The angels in heaven would surely give up their wings for one trip to Japopo's all-you-can-eat penne bar".
- It's good.
- Really?
- You're being sarcastic, right?
- No.
- Then it's bad.
- Shit.
Writing this is so much harder than I thought it would be.
Hey, you wanna smoke a little?
Get the creative juices going.
It's been a while.
No, I gotta stay focused.
If we get high, we'll just end up designing sneakers again.
Okay, what is going on with you?
You don't wanna smoke, you were in the hospital, now you're writing a good review for a place you once called "thunderously mundane".
I don't wanna lie to you anymore.
- Good.
- But I can't tell ya.
- Seriously?
- I'm sorry.
All right.
Thanks, Rick.
Yeah.
Just don't disappear on me, man.
I'm trying not to.
- Mm.
- Oh.
You guys are hugging.
That's so nice.
Don't stop on my account, but when you're done, Joel, I really need to talk to you.
We're good.
Bye-bye, Rick.
So, I was boxing with Anne, and she thinks that all the missing people in Santa Clarita might be connected.
- Shit!
- I tried to convince her to let it go.
But with almost poetic irony, I inspired her to get to the bottom of it.
Jesus.
I told you, you shouldn't be friends with a cop.
It's too dangerous.
Said by the man who was just wrapped in a warm embrace with a cop.
That's different.
Anne is an intense and ambitious sheriff's deputy.
Rick joined the Santa Monica Police so he could ride a horse on the beach.
Well, we can sit around and play the blame game.
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're wrong.
You're the one who put us at risk.
- How am I wrong?
- I thought we just agreed we weren't gonna play that game.
What's important now is that we have to be careful because Anne is interested in our crime.
- For a reason that's nobody's fault.
- Yours.
That aside, we have been getting sloppy.
That Serb you killed in here?
I put his shoes on this morning.
And we have Gary's head and a mutant spider ball with legs in the basement.
We have to get everything incriminating out of the house.
And if it's not safe to kill that Nazi, we're not doing it.
- You're right.
It's just - It's just what?
I want to.
Good morning, outlaws.
Hey, Abby, I want to talk to you about yesterday.
When you were choking Ramona with your belt, that was quite a moment.
Yeah, I also flagged that as something to circle back to.
How you feeling?
Fine.
I saved my best friend's life.
I promise not to make a habit of choking people.
Okay?
But I'm late.
- Okay, well, we worry about you.
- Don't.
I'm okay.
Listen, Abs, our day just got kind of busy.
So could we put you in charge of dinner tonight?
Sure, and since I'm in charge, I want you to order in Thai food, okay?
Love you, bye.
Man, I just got handled.
- Ordering in.
- I know, and it happened so fast.
No, we should try that.
If it's too risky to kill Boone at his house, we should have him delivered.
Interesting.
Go on.
Well, now that Anne is looking into things, which something that just happened, let's move on, we need to rethink our whole operation.
I agree.
We have been erring on the side of incompetence.
- Some of us more than others.
- So I was thinking, screw you, we get a storage unit that's just dedicated to killing.
Then we line the room with plastic and move the freezer into it, so we can easily clean everything up.
Next, we move Gary's head and Mr. Ball Legs out of our basement and put them in our old storage unit.
- Why do I have to move?
- You'll be happier here.
- It's like having your own place.
- Yeah, sure.
- Is that what you told the Bowflex?
- We'll get you a TV.
Maybe plug in a lava lamp.
- Groovy.
- You barely visited me in the basement.
Are you ever gonna visit me when I'm halfway across town?
Of course, we will, Gary.
It's only a chore if you make it a chore.
Then, we find a way to lure Boone into the kill room.
- Should we add a swastika?
- I don't want to draw a swastika.
Well, we should add something intolerant.
Then, we let Nazis be Nazis.
Hey.
I'm white.
Hey, Eric.
So I was looking in the paper for more missing people, you know, just, like, seeing what my mom and dad are up to, and I found this article.
Did you know they're gonna start fracking, like, four miles from here?
Yeah, we've been talking about it in Environmental Club.
Fracking is a heinous defilement of the planet.
Although, the science behind it is exquisite.
Abby, there's a rumor you were expelled for whacking Christian with that tray.
And Bobby Ramirez said that the school put a chip in your neck.
I'm not getting expelled.
No teachers saw it.
And Bobby Ramirez says a lot of weird stuff - since he got hit with that Smart Car.
- Hi, Sarah.
Eric Bemis.
There's another rumor that Christian was crying in the locker room, but then other people said that it wasn't him.
It was just some random guy that doesn't even go to this school, who's blind.
Don't people have more important things to talk about?
They're gonna start fracking in Santa Clarita.
Oh, my God.
That's terrible.
You don't know what fracking is, do you?
I know it's, like, super cancery.
They inject poisonous chemicals into the ground to break up rock and release natural gas.
Eric Bemis.
Yeah, it causes earthquakes, it pollutes the groundwater.
It's messed up.
Someone needs to stop them.
People shouldn't be able to do whatever they want and just get away with it.
Abby Hammond to the principal's office.
Oh.
Sounds like somebody's getting her chip reprogrammed.
Yeah.
Eric Bemis.
Nope.
"Japopo's has it all.
There's fish from the ocean, and meat from the land".
This sucks.
Joel.
I just heard from Boone.
He got the flyer.
It worked!
He's gonna swing by the storage unit at 4:00.
It's happening, baby.
We're going premeditated.
We're going pre-med.
Yay, first-degree.
It's kind of ironic.
The more care you put into a murder, the harsher society judges you.
And you'd be proud of me because Carl just mansplained to me how to work a lockbox.
I smiled, said "thank you," and didn't pull out the vocal cords he used to insult me.
Somebody's ready for an audience with the Pope.
You were right.
I was overly impulsive.
Including my friendship with Anne.
It's too risky.
I'm gonna break it off.
Good.
I appreciate you taking responsibility.
We really do have to be careful, honey.
We have to watch what we say and who we say it to.
Joel?
Ron?
They let you out?
Yeah.
Budget cuts!
I saw you coming out of Japopo's this morning, and I was like, "That is my friend Joel from the mental hospital.
I wonder how he is".
Is this your wife?
The the Brains.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yes, my love?
I'm gonna tell you what I think happened, and then you can correct me if I'm wrong.
All right?
Of course, my darling.
You gave me a hard time for befriending Anne, which could expose us, while knowing full well you told this guy that I was undead, which totally exposes us.
Am I missing anything?
Okay, I'm sorry, but He's crazy.
I figured if he ever did get out, nobody would believe him, anyway.
"I'm sorry, but" is not an apology.
You totally gave me up.
You put both of us in jeopardy.
And the way you described me?
Brains?
I go for the guts first.
Or do you even listen to me?
Okay.
You're mad.
I'll go talk to Ron.
And I love you.
We don't say that enough.
Just casually.
But it's true.
Go!
Listen, Ron.
Last time we saw each other, I was a little out of it.
My wife is not undead.
Right.
Got it.
So I actually know some people in paranormal circles that would love to meet her.
Maybe watch her eat someone.
Wouldn't that be a treat?
She's not undead.
And if you tell anyone she is, right before she kills me, - I'm gonna kill you.
You understand?
- Okay.
Jeez, I won't say anything.
- You promise?
- Yes.
Let's not let that come between what we have.
You hungry?
You wanna share a hoagie?
No, I probably shouldn't.
She's a little upset.
See, she became friends with a cop, which I thought was really dangerous because You know what?
Fuck this.
I'm done telling you things.
I have conducted a thorough investigation into the violent incident in the lunchroom yesterday.
And while I have evidence to expel you, if you confess, I may show mercy.
I'm gonna call your bluff.
I don't think you have anything.
You behaved like a rabid dog, it will not stand.
Confess.
If you had any proof, you would've called my parents in.
- Confess.
- No.
Okay, I don't have any evidence.
So I cannot punish you for your tray outburst.
But you have several unexcused absences, which I can punish you for.
So, how about - a month of detention?
Mm.
- A month?
Principal Novak, please, my family is going through this very complicated thing right now.
I don't wanna be away from home that much.
Oh, not such a Cocky Carolyn now, are we, hmm?
- Good afternoon.
- Eric!
What brings you here?
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Would you care for a paczki?
There's chocolate in the center.
Don't be surprised.
No, thank you.
I'm just here on Abby's behalf to make sure she's treated fairly.
Too late.
He called me a "rabid dog" and gave me a month of detention.
My decision and my analogy both stand.
Eric, would you care to take a dive in the candy drawer?
After your heroics at the Science Olympiad last week, - you certainly deserve it.
- No, thank you.
Maybe we can figure out something for Abby to do besides detention.
What if she joined the Environmental Club instead?
That's a great idea.
Sorry, madam, the loose goose does not escape the moose.
- Noose.
- What?
Are you sure we can't work something out?
Because it'd just be such a shame if I didn't compete in the final Science Olympiad this year.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
You saved me.
And the way you stood up to Novak!
Holy shit.
I was trying to channel the swagger of Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything before he got Lou Gehrig's Disease.
You know, that totally came through.
I like this side of you.
You were a badass.
"Eric the Badass".
I like it.
"Son of Lisa the Pharma Rep.
Neighbor of Joel".
Put that on a shield and fight dragons with it.
I would really love that.
So I'll see you at lunch in the Environmental Club?
Yeah.
We're gonna get those frackers.
Tits to teeth.
Hmm?
- I told my mom that was a thing.
- Okay.
- Hey.
Tray girl, right?
- Oh, Abby.
I'm Sven.
That was really cool what you did to Christian in the cafeteria yesterday.
Oh.
Thank you.
You didn't think it was too extreme?
Oh, it was definitely too extreme.
That's what made it so awesome.
That guy's been a dick since sixth grade.
It's really nice to see someone finally take him down.
Uh, I'm Abby.
- Yeah, you said.
I'm still Sven.
- Right.
Tell me something I don't know, Tray Girl.
Like your phone number.
Oh, my God.
That's so good.
So, I'm thinking, Boone walks in, "Hey, fuckers.
Where's your Nazi memorabilia, fuckers"?
And then when he crosses to the trunk and bends down to open it, one of us takes a bite out of his neck.
- I suggest, me.
- So what do I do?
Oh!
You'll be running around telling strangers that your wife is undead.
- I said I was sorry about Ron.
- No.
You said, "I'm sorry, but" That's not an apology, that's a rationalization.
Here's a way to remember it.
Inside of every "but" is an asshole.
That's very helpful.
However, we should drop it because Boone will be here any minute.
Fine.
I think our kill room looks too much like a kill room.
Yeah.
Feels like we copied it from a kill room catalogue.
- I could add a basket of seashells.
- Might warm it up.
Too late.
He's here.
This is it.
Going pre-med, baby.
Holy shit!
It's you guys.
Kayla's friends.
Boone?
Oh, I didn't recognize your voice on the phone.
What a small world.
Honey, it's Boone.
It is Boone!
Hey, Boone.
Booney Tunes.
- What's with all the plastic?
- Oh, it's a clean room.
It's what museums do to protect their priceless artifacts.
We used to be curators.
Oh.
Did you lose your jobs to Mexicans?
Wow.
You need to go over there right now and look inside that trunk.
- Yeah, go on now.
Lots to see - Not so fast.
What's wrong?
I gotta get my friend.
He's the expert on this stuff.
- He brought a friend?
- He didn't tell me he was going to bring a friend.
- We can't kill two people.
- Well, we can't not kill them.
That trunk is empty.
And as soon as they go look inside, they're gonna know something's up.
What if we tell them that's Hitler's fruit basket and Goebbels' fern?
I know we're spitballing, but that's terrible.
- Agreed.
- We're just gonna go for it.
New plan.
I'm gonna kill the one guy while you distract the other, - and then I'm gonna kill him, too.
- Jesus.
That's barely a plan.
We can do this.
Come on, these guys are Nazis, we still have the moral high ground.
What if one of the Nazis is in a wheelchair?
God, I hope that's an oddly-timed philosophical question.
No.
Boone's buddy is in a wheelchair.
Hmm.
Did this just get easier or harder?
I don't know.
Killing someone in a wheelchair might be a hate crime.
Well, these are Nazis.
They invented hate crimes.
Still, killing him feels discriminatory.
Or is it discriminatory not to kill him?
He wouldn't wanna be treated unequally because he's disabled.
Or would he want that because then he would be alive?
I guess if we're on the fence, we shouldn't do it.
Yeah, let's get them out of here, then go read up on moral relativism.
- This is Kevin.
- Hey.
Boone says you guys are curators.
I bet you have great stuff.
Actually, there's been a change of plans.
We're no longer selling.
What the fuck are you talking about?
We drove all the way up from Long Beach.
I missed physical therapy.
You know how hard it is to book a white nurse?
I hear the annoyance in your voice.
The demographics in that industry are changing.
Still, we've decided to donate our memorabilia to an orphanage.
A Nazi orphanage.
That's bullshit.
Well, actually, Kevin, we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.
Let go of my handles, bitch.
There must be something really good in there if you don't even want us to look.
Maybe we'll just take it.
Boone.
Stop!
Think of the Nazi children!
I know what's going on here.
You were all set to sell till you saw me in this wheelchair.
- What?
- This is discrimination.
You're discriminating against me.
We don't discriminate.
You people discriminate.
"You people"?
You mean people in wheelchairs?
No, I don't care about the wheelchair.
Shame on you, treating a whole group of people like they're second-class citizens.
You're worse than my Jew landlord.
Do you hear yourself?
I don't want to be treated differently than anybody else, you gypsy-nosed cunt!
I mean May I show you Hitler's favorite fruit basket?
- What the fuck?
- It's wicker.
Okay, then.
I'm going to step out.
Text me when you're done.
Stop fracking, start snacking.
Brownies, three for a dollar.
Less than it costs to make them.
- I feel like this is a waste of time.
- What are you talking about?
We only need to sell 30 more lemon squares to buy a promoted Tweet.
Yeah, I'm out.
Abby, where are you going?
I promised Novak you'd join Environmental Club.
No.
I'm "Tray Girl".
I need to do something more intense than a Tweet.
Something that might actually stop fracking, like chain myself to something, or stop eating something, or eat a lot of something.
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.
Wait.
Whatever it is, I'll do it with you.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
As you saw with Novak, I can handle intense.
I'm "Eric the Badass.
Son of Lisa the Pharma Rep Friend of Abby".
You're all of those things.
- Let's get out of here.
- So, "Tray Girl"?
Is that what people are calling you now?
Some people.
Huh.
You're sighing a lot over there, chief.
No valentines in your mailbox?
Trying to find a change of clothes for Sheila.
I just watched my wife do something.
I've seen her do this thing before, but it's not something I ever get used to.
Joel.
I saw your gal eat her way into my stomach.
You don't have to be coy.
She ripped two dudes' throats out of their necks like they were Twizzlers.
Whoa.
You can't unsee that.
She gets this look in her eye.
The next thing you know, she's yanking intestines out of these guys like a magician pulling out scarves.
The other day, I came home and my kitchen looked like someone shot a person out of a confetti gun.
- There was a dick in my fruit bowl.
- Oh.
The next morning, I'm eating oatmeal at the same counter like my life is Leave it to Fucking Beaver.
I guess somebody did need to talk.
It's not like I can talk about this to my friends.
I told this guy Ron about it, and it turned into a shitstorm.
Yeah, it can be lonely not having anyone to talk to.
For me, being buried alive was kind of an isolating experience.
Again, sorry about that, but we didn't know about killing the brain.
Joel "Sorry, but" is not a real apology.
Well, I wouldn't call them a master race, but delicious.
We did it.
Our new plan is going to work.
Listen I shouldn't have given you a hard time about making friends with Anne.
Really?
Where did that come from?
- Gary.
- It's just we live this secret life, and that can make us feel alone sometimes.
So I get why you'd wanna reach out to people.
- Is that why you talked to Ron?
- That doesn't excuse it.
I shouldn't have told him about you.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Full stop.
I want to kiss you so badly right now but I have Nazi-breath.
Huh.
I was wrong.
Yes, we agreed on that.
Thank you for saying it.
No, I mean, I was wrong.
That's all anybody wants to hear.
So, tell us about this undead woman that you met.
Yeah, what's her name?
She - wouldn't want me to tell you.
- Ron.
I'm sorry.
I can no longer discuss it.
Buddy, you called us.
We UberPooled all the way up from Irvine.
And somebody talked to Tom from Reseda the entire two hours.
Well, maybe somebody would like to be heard for once.
Well, I hope it wasn't Tom because he didn't get a word in.
So, Ron, if you don't give us something useful, I will personally ban you from the Paranormal subreddit.
That's right.
You won't be able to post.
You won't be able to upvote or downvote.
- It'll be like you're dead.
- No.
Please.
Buddy, we know this is real.
All right, there are people in Santa Clarita looking for Serbian bile.
So whatever you can tell us would be greatly appreciated.
All right.
I saw her husband coming out of this restaurant yesterday and he seemed very agitated.
- Agitated.
- Interesting.
We have to find these people.
It's our sacred task.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, I hate to be that guy, but I asked for my dressing on the side.

1 Calzone, eggplant parm, mushroom pizza.
No clams.
Spaghetti, lasagna.
No clams.
Going through all these Japopo's receipts is making me hungry.
Can we go there tonight?
They may have killed your mother, so no.
Also, the food's not great.
Hey, if I ask you a boy question, will you promise not to be weird?
- I promise.
- There's this guy at school, Sven You can do better.
Okay, starting now.
He asked me out, so we're getting coffee today.
Do I tell Eric, who likes me and may be really hurt?
Or do I not tell him, which feels like I'm hiding it because Sven is hot and spent a summer in Greece playing guitar?
Well, let me ask you a question.
Does Sven know your mother and I are constantly looking for people to kill?
Dad.
Okay.
Eric is your friend, and it's gonna hurt him a lot more if he finds out from someone else, so you should tell him.
Thanks, Dad.
That was uncharacteristically good parenting.
Couldn't just let me have the straight win, huh?
I feel like I gave you enough.
Hi, guys.
How's it going with the receipts?
This is the final one.
And it's chicken piccata.
Someone didn't read my first Yelp review.
"If you like capers, try a Marx Brothers movie because you won't find any in this piccata"!
Okay.
So, the night we ate at Japopo's, clams was a special, and only three people ordered them.
You, Ramona, and a guy named Ed Thune.
Colonel Ed Thune.
We Googled him.
He's single, retired, and he thinks that a profile picture is literally a profile.
If he's undead, the clams are definitely the source of this thing.
You and Ramona could be a coincidence, but three people is a pattern.
Way to go, you guys.
This is huge!
If we know it's the clams, we can stop it from spreading.
We could literally save the world!
It's all up to us!
- Then let's go find Ed Thune!
- Ooh!
- Today's not good.
- What?
Honey, it's the world.
We have that meeting with Carl, and then we're pitching to that investor.
Yeah, but - The world!
- Dad's right.
What could possibly be more important than saving the Holy shit, it's Sven!
Hey, how was paddle boarding?
Who's Sven?
Just a boy who's gonna break Eric's heart.
I really think we should talk to Ed Thune today.
We absolutely should, tomorrow, because if we don't make that meeting today, Carl's gonna take us off the biggest project of our lives.
But if Ed is feral and infecting people today, what good is a housing development when rabid armies of flesh-eating goons are roamin' the streets?
- We both have really good arguments.
- I don't think we both do.
Okay, how about this?
You go talk to Ed.
And if he's undead, we know it's the clams.
And if he's feral, we go back together and make him regular dead.
In the meantime, I'm gonna take that meeting with Carl.
Speaking of making people dead, you should not go talk to Carl by yourself.
Don't worry, I have a plan.
I'm just gonna act like old Sheila, who's demure and chipper and never had an orgasm while eating a man's liver.
Judging by your look, I haven't mentioned that before.
No, you have.
I just never know what to say.
You think you can even act like the old Sheila around Carl?
I think so, but maybe you're right.
Maybe it's too dangerous, and I shouldn't go.
- I really think that's best.
- Fooled you, motherfucka.
That was the old, agreeable Sheila.
I'm gonna nail this.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Anne.
Hey, uh, Joel, you're a pretty good dancer, right?
- No.
Who told you that?
- You did.
Remember, honey, that's why you trashed Principal Novak's house, is because you were giving his grandmother dancing lessons.
Of course.
I was confused because you asked me if I was a pretty good dancer, which I'm not.
I'm an outstanding dancer.
Salsa, tango, numerous others that I know.
Perfect!
Lisa's birthday's coming up, and I wanna take her dancing.
She loves the tango, but I don't know the first thing about it.
Can you teach me?
The thing is, I'm a little busy.
- Yeah, he's really busy.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.
I could do it anytime, work around your schedule.
- Okay.
- Great.
How's tonight at 6:00?
- Okay.
- I have Bible study at 9:00.
- Is three hours enough time?
- Okay.
Perfect.
I'll see you tonight.
Bye, Sheila.
Bye, Anne.
- What the fuck?
- She makes me nervous.
You said you were busy, and I backed you up.
All you had to do was stick with that.
I'm worried about you talking to Ed Thune without me.
He's a colonel, and as you just demonstrated with Deputy Garcia, you're not good with authority.
I think it's because you have a cold, dominating dad.
- Can we leave Father out of this?
- The way you froze with Anne?
If you do that with Colonel Thune and he's gone feral, you're gonna end up wearing your intestines as a necklace.
Fine.
I'll just stake the place out, see what I can learn.
I promise I'll be the coward you want me to be.
Thank you.
- Have a good day.
- You too.
Don't kill Carl.
Okay.
Don't get killed by Ed.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Here is the satellite image of the fracking site.
I think that that blurry thing might be a construction trailer.
Or a shoebox.
I'm having trouble with the scale.
Well, that's a field or gravy.
Maybe we should bring biscuits just to be safe.
It's gonna be hard shutting down a fracking site if we don't know what's there.
We need better pictures.
We can't just go in there.
They'll see us.
- Do you know what a ghillie suit is?
- Assume I don't.
It's a camouflage outfit that snipers make from local flora, which enables them to disappear into their surroundings.
If you have a couple extra hours this afternoon, we can gather dirt and leaves I have a date today.
What?
Sorry.
That was the wrong way to do that.
I thought it would be better if you found out from me than someone else.
- There's this guy, Sven.
- Cool.
Cool.
Do you mean handsome Sven who was on Good Morning America after he saved his little brother from a shark attack?
Or another totally non-threatening Sven who I've never met or heard of?
- This is weird for you.
- Totally not weird.
Heard the shark wasn't even that big, so You sure you're okay with it?
'Cause, you know, if you're not, then I could Okay, thought you were gonna jump in there, but I am going out with him.
And you should, 100 percent.
You were happy for me when I went out with Ramona, so I'm happy for you.
Because if life has taught me anything, it's that human emotion is all about fairness.
Well, thank you for trying and failing to be cool.
That's kinda my jiggity jam.
Good morning, Carl.
I stopped on the way and got your coffee.
Oh, give it to me.
I also picked up some of those Danishes your doctor doesn't let you have.
Oh, you are bad.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh.
So good.
Come on, let's be bad together.
Oh, I can't.
I'm on a new diet.
I can only eat meat.
- That's stupid.
Come on, have one.
- I will literally throw up on you.
Fine.
Fuck me for being generous.
All right, well, the investor's gonna be here this afternoon to hear the concepts for the first six houses.
Yeah, I know, Carl.
You're reading off a memo I wrote to you.
Whoa!
You're rough in the morning.
Have a lamb chop or somethin'.
Nobody is stealing your memo byline, okay?
- Anyway - "Anyhoo".
I like it when girls say "anyhoo".
It's cute.
- Um, anyhoo - Better!
Um, I've been doing some research, and I thought that maybe we could design these homes with a more sustainable approach than we typically see in Santa Clarita.
There's this article in the New York Times about smart homes.
I'm gonna stop you right there.
People don't give a shit about sustainability.
They want big beige boxes.
Actually, according to this study, many new home buyers Sheila.
Mm-mm?
Big beige boxes is how we make money.
Now, if you wanna be part of that, your job is to smile and back up everything I say.
Understand?
Absolutely.
Well, then let's see the smile.
Come on, bigger.
More teeth.
That's better.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is wrong with your eye?
Oh, shit!
Well, that told me nothing.
Fuck it.
- Yes?
- Good morning.
I'm Martin L. Taylor, Esquire, and I'm putting together a lawsuit against a local eatery, Japopo's.
If you've eaten there recently, you may be entitled to a share of a very large settlement.
Sorry, son, I've never been there.
Now, if you'll excuse me You are Ed Thune, right?
- Colonel Ed Thune.
- It's just This is your receipt, isn't it, Colonel?
Oh, Japopo's.
Yeah, the Italian place on Soledad.
I'd completely forgotten.
If I could just ask you a few questions Of course, Martin.
Come on in.
I wouldn't want to impose.
We can just talk here.
Nonsense.
You're letting all the cold air out.
Come inside.
Okay.
You're not deteriorating.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, your blood Technically, your black goo hasn't changed since we gave you the serum.
May I?
Well, that's a relief.
Looks like you got the eye back in okay.
That's good.
Eh Except I got your nose.
If I'm not deteriorating, then why did my eye get weird?
Well, I noticed you've been biting your nails.
- Are you under stress?
- A little.
I'm working on a project with my boss, and he doesn't like the newer, bolder me.
So, I'm trying to act like old Sheila, when, really, all I wanna do is snap off his jaw and feed him his balls.
Well, like any of us, when you bottle up your feelings, they come out in other ways.
For some, it's hives or panic attacks or getting shingles so young, your doctor wants to send you to Virginia for a special study.
- Maybe you should quit the project.
- I can't.
Why not?
It's only money.
And everyone with money says money's not important.
It's more than that.
If I can't control my emotions, then I can't function in the world.
And I don't wanna go through life only being undead.
I understand.
It's like that billboard with the old guy riding a bike that says, "I am more than my irritable bowel syndrome".
Yeah, kind of.
We thought my grandma had irritable bowel.
Turns out she was just what her pharmacist called a "grumpy pooper".
Eric, I adore you, but this isn't helping.
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna have to suck it up.
That's what people do at work all the time.
Just tell me that it isn't gonna get worse.
Oh, it'll probably get a lot worse.
For all we know, your eye could pop out and, well, take somebody's eye out.
This is a complicated medical condition.
Maybe I will style my hair differently so no one will see.
Yeah.
That might work.
Wandering around Greece playing my guitar was like a dream.
After a month, I woke up, and I realized I'd travelled halfway around the world, and I'd taken all my problems with me.
Yeah, wherever you go, there you are.
Yeah.
So, I went home.
I'd also left my guitar on a train after an old lady got me drunk on ouzo.
Right, but now I'm just the guy who talks about himself.
So, Abby Hammond, what is your deal?
Well, let's see.
What can I tell you?
What can I tell you?
My parents are realtors.
A co-worker of theirs was staying in our basement for a while.
He was a handful.
And oh, here's something I just found out.
I'm really boring on dates.
You're not boring.
You hit Christian in the face with a frickin' lunch tray.
The girl who did that has a story to tell.
Yeah, she does.
Okay, then tell it.
I wanna hear it.
Well, at first, I was just upset.
I saw what he did to Janie and that no one else was gonna do anything.
And then it's like I felt this quiet, overwhelming rage.
It was so strong, I picked that lunch tray up without even feeling it.
I just kept thinking about Janie and about all the other girls Christian was gonna dick over in the future, and the next thing I remember is the sound of the hard plastic hitting his face.
That's when I got scared.
Not scared that I'd done anything wrong, but scared how good it felt to hurt him.
Jesus.
Anyway, that's me.
What've you been up to since you got back from Greece?
Um, uh, I don't know.
I like to play soccer.
Um, photography.
I like to paddle board.
Photography?
Do you have a good camera?
So, Japopo's was selling bad clams.
That's terrible.
- Yeah.
- Is everyone all right?
Some people got pretty sick.
Really?
How sick?
Did they vomit?
Yes, they did, Ed.
Why?
Did you?
No.
Thank God.
I hate food poisoning.
Good thing I didn't have the clams, Martin.
- You didn't?
Are you sure?
- Positive.
I'm a vegan.
It's just strange because the receipt says you did have the clams.
My date must've had the clams.
I had a salad.
- Oh.
You were on a date?
- Yes, Martin.
People my age date.
Of course.
Right on.
So, did your date get sick?
I don't know.
I haven't heard from her since that night.
There was no connection.
- So, do you know where she is now?
- Barbara?
I have her phone number written on a post-it out in the kitchen.
Why don't you come with me and we can chat some more?
The kitchen is just right here, behind this door.
No.
I'll stay here and enjoy your clocks.
Are you sure?
I just made some Danish.
I used fresh apples from the tree in my backyard.
It's delicious.
You can eat Danish?
I'm a vegan, not a monster.
Of course I eat Danish.
I would like to see that Danish and eat it, together.
Weird way of saying that, but okay.
Barbara's number is here someplace.
So, how about that pastry?
Somebody's hungry.
It's right there on the table.
Help yourself.
- Hey, Ed, what's with the tarps?
- Oh.
Pardon the mess.
I'm painting.
- I don't see any paint.
- Haven't bought the paint.
- But you bought the tarps?
- They didn't have the color I wanted.
Is that okay with you, guy who just walked into my house?
I just wanna eat Danish with you.
Why can't we eat Danish together?
You said Barbara might be sick.
I want to get you her number.
I'll bet you it's in the basement.
Let's go to my basement.
I'm not going to your basement.
I have a problem with stairs.
Extreme vertigo.
I faint if I look directly into the washing machine.
I get it.
"Let's go to my basement" did sound kinda creepy.
It's just that's where my office is.
I just redid it.
You should come take a look.
I'm doing it again.
I'll be right back.
Find anything interesting?
So, this development is more upscale, but, I mean, there's no reason to reinvent the wheel.
Exactly.
Why would anyone want to reinvent the wheel?
So smart!
So, we just build the houses that we know people like.
We just build them bigger.
It means more profits.
Money, money, money, money, money!
It's what makes the world go round.
Like a wheel.
Why reinvent it?
Anyhoo, Carl?
Thanks, Sheila.
I love the hair, by the way.
You look like an attainable Jessica Rabbit.
Wow!
You really have a way with words and houses.
Carl.
Wait.
So, your plan is to just build the same thing but bigger?
You get it.
Todd gets it.
- So smart.
- I don't know.
I was hoping for something more forward-thinking, disruptive.
Like Uber.
But, it's a house.
We have another eco-friendly idea that you might be uber interested in.
Great.
Love to hear it, but give me a minute.
My brother's contesting the will.
What was that, Sheila?
I don't know.
Sounds like someone died, and his brother wants more money than Todd feels he's entitled to.
No, I mean why the fuck did you say that you had another idea?
Because we're losing him, Carl.
He wants something different.
I don't care what he wants.
Your only job here is to support me.
If you can't do that, then go on back to the kiddie pool.
You understand?
Yes, Carl.
We are a team, Sheila, and there is no "I" in "team".
There is a "me" and a "mate" and a "meat".
And "tame" and "eat" and "mat".
Are you following me?
See, because I see things from all angles.
That's why I am in charge.
So, tame your meat and be a teammate to me.
Okay.
- There he is!
Hey, Todd.
- Sorry about that.
My brother and my father's nurse think they're smarter than me.
And they're not.
Oh.
Well, jumping back in Hang on.
Sheila, didn't you say you had a different take?
I think Carl's idea is the way to go.
Because I read something about millennials wanting eco-friendly homes.
- Is that what you were talking about?
- Nuh-uh.
Are you sure?
It sounded like it was.
No.
See, sales and marketing is really Sheila's forte.
You really can't listen to her when she starts spouting off about the big picture stuff.
Todd, step over here to the easel.
Let me show you what I'm talking about.
Look at that master bathroom.
You could wash a car in that thing.
What people want is space, luxury.
I've been in this business a lot longer than Sheila, and I know what sells.
Trust me, bigger is better.
And forget Sheila and her eco bullshit.
Why were you rummaging through my freezer, Martin?
I was just looking for ice cream to put on my Danish.
Here's Barbara's number.
Turns out it was next to the phone, and I think you should leave.
- But we haven't had our Danish.
- You can take your Danish to go, son.
Oh.
Actually, I would really like us to eat it together.
Is that necessary?
Yes.
Danish is a treat.
It's no fun eating it alone.
Okay, Martin.
Damn, that's good.
- Boy, that is good.
- Mm.
Mm-hm.
Listen, Colonel.
I'm sorry about all this.
I'll get out of your hair.
Thanks for Barbara's number.
Well, I hope she's all right.
Yeah, me too.
Well, nice meeting you, Martin.
God!
- I'm gonna need that skin back.
- Fuck!
God!
Looking for this?
Fuck!
Now, Ed, hold on.
Ed Hey, easy.
Ed, it doesn't have to go like this.
I have a serum that can keep you from going feral.
Okay, we're past that.
I just learned that.
Fuck.
I've never spent a summer in Greece And I don't really play guitar Sven is so much cooler than me - I wish I was my avatar - Hey!
I gotta tell you what happened with Sven.
Abby, I don't want to hold my feelings in until my eyes pop out.
So, I'm happy that you're happy, but I'm not ready to hear any details.
- The date didn't go well.
- Tell me everything.
All right, well, Sven's really thoughtful, and I like him a lot.
He's got amazing hair, and he smells kinda like summer at the beach.
This better go south fast.
- But I couldn't talk to him.
- Here we go.
I couldn't tell him anything real about myself.
And when I did, he couldn't handle it.
You know, my life's just gotten so big and crazy, the only person I can really share it with is well, you.
Gee, not being able to connect with Sven must've made you sad and disappointed.
My tragic love life makes you really happy, doesn't it?
No, no.
I feel terrible for you?
Stop it.
Okay, look, I got Sven to take me to the fracking site.
He has this really fancy camera, so we didn't need to get too close.
The guards thought we were just teenagers taking pictures of each other, you know, before we banged it out on the hood of his Mazda.
- What?
Oh, okay.
Payback.
- Mm-hm.
Anyway, look at this fence.
Right there, there's a tree.
You could easily throw a blanket on that barbed wire, and we're in.
And this billboard can be seen from the highway.
That's where we make our statement.
Wow.
We're really gonna do this?
I want to do it.
- Are you in?
- I am in.
Huh, this is the exact conversation I had with Sven on the hood of his car.
Okay, you know what?
You are a guest in my room.
Sheila?
I found the guy, and it was the clams!
- Oh, look who's here.
- Anne came for her dance lesson.
So, that should be fun.
What were you saying about clams, Joel?
You seemed pretty agitated.
Anne, I was discussing a private seafood matter with my wife.
- Do you have a problem with that?
- No, it just sounded strange Great.
That's settled.
Now, you want me to teach you how to tango?
Here's how I tango.
These moves may be unorthodox but, on the dance floor the only authority I bow to is rhythm.
Tango.
Lisa also wanted a blender for her birthday, so I'm just gonna get her that.
- Good night, Sheila.
- Bye, Anne.
I recommend the Vitamix.
Cuts through anything.
You can liquefy a golf ball.
So I know you told me not to confront Ed, but I did, and he was undead and he attacked me, but I held my ground.
And I killed him.
Then I threw his body in the trunk, drove it out to the desert, and buried him, but now we know it is the clams.
We just have to find Japopo's seafood distributor, and maybe we can stop this thing.
That's great, honey.
Are you okay?
Being undead and having a successful career is going to be more challenging than I thought.
- I had a little incident.
- Oh, no.
Did you attack someone?
Kind of.
Me.
Fuck.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
You bit your finger off?
What problem was that solving?
Obviously, it was an accident.
How do you accidentally bite off an appendage?
Because I was trying to keep my shit together around Carl, who I didn't kill, by the way.
No credit there.
Fine.
I was biting my nails.
Then all of a sudden, crunch.
Jesus Christ.
You're stress-eating yourself.
Did anyone see you?
No.
I ran to the bathroom and wrapped it up.
And by the time I got back, the investor had left.
It's a clean bite.
- You think it can be reattached?
- I don't know.
Maybe there's a way to stick it back on.
Rubber band, extension cord chip clip?
No.
Billy Joel CD, Blockbuster card hey, one of our stress balls.
Remember these?
"You won't be stressed when you work with the best".
Well, I think I'm pretty fucking stressed.
Is this your toe?
I didn't wanna throw it out.
Well, it shouldn't be in the junk drawer.
It should be Well, I guess we can put it back in here for now.
The only good thing was Carl screwed up his pitch so badly, that the investor wants to hear my idea.
So you and I are gonna go present it to him tomorrow.
No.
You can't be around Carl.
You're chewing off pieces of yourself.
Carl won't be there.
He was so humiliated that he claimed he'll be busy golfing with all the living presidents.
You could see on his face he knew he overreached.
Carl may not be at that meeting, but there'll be a hundred more meetings.
By the time we finish this project, you'll just be a mouth on a chair.
Jesus, Joel.
A mouth I would still proudly call my wife.
Well, I'm not giving up on this project.
I don't want to stop living just because I'm undead!
- Shit!
- Shit!
Did you see where it went?
- Oh, my God.
- Did you find it?
Abby's pacifier.
- Oh, my God, her "mi-mi".
- I know.
So fast.
- Shit!
- Shit!
I got your text that it was the clams.
That's great news.
I've already started researching where Japopo's gets them.
Now's not a good time.
Real quick.
Couldn't find their supplier online, but I have a plan.
Tomorrow, we go to Japopo's posing as a father-son seafood company.
We're business partners, we're friends, we're family.
My wife lost her finger.
Like in a crab trap?
Probably hard to work that in, but it's great that you're already thinking about backstory.
Found it!
And we've got ants.
Just get inside.
Do you think we can fix it?
Yeah, because my toe would never stay on.
Well, your toe rotted off, so it was dead-dead.
But your finger was severed, so it's more living-dead, which means if we set it, there's a chance it can go back to normal.
What if it doesn't?
I guess you could say you had an accident.
Joel and I were thinking crab trap.
Right, "Dad"?
We're not posing as father-son seafood distributors.
The guy at Japopo's already thinks I'm making a documentary about tipping.
Don't get me wrong, there's a story to be told there, but my plate is way too full.
Sure, I get it.
Ain't no thang, you know.
Okay, try it now.
Whoa.
I can lose parts and reattach them.
I'm like a snowman.
Our lives just keep getting better and better.
I'd go easy on it for a few days.
Months?
Seconds?
I don't know.
But definitely do keep it dry.
Or moist?
So, this was a reaction to your boss?
Yeah, he was being a condescending prick again.
You should send Abby over there with a lunch tray.
She'll straighten him out.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah.
What do you mean?
- The tray thing.
-  What tray thing?
What tray thing?
I can't believe Abby smashed a boy in the face with a tray.
God, we have so much going on.
When does it end?
We do have a lot of balls in the air.
How do jugglers do it?
They keep five things going at once.
And dangerous things chainsaws, knives.
I once saw a juggler juggle a smaller juggler.
How is that dangerous?
He was juggling the smaller guy against his will.
Oh.
Was that part of the act or something that just happened?
I didn't see the start of it.
The point is juggling a lot of things is hard, especially if some of those things don't want to be there.
So, what's the plan?
We have all the information, but she doesn't know that.
- So for once, we're one step ahead.
-  Finally!
I say we go in, ask her about school, and give her the chance to talk about the tray thing.
-  Smart.
- Yes.
I can hear you.
-  Shit.
-  Fuck.
Abby, are you in there?
If so, your mother and I would like to talk to you.
Oh, my God.
Come in.
- Hey!
- Hi!
Guys, I have some unprompted honesty I'd love to share with you.
I hit someone with a tray.
Well, now we know.
What we don't know is what you were thinking.
He was being a dick to his ex-girlfriend online.
Well, people can be jerks, Abby.
But unless they come at you with a knife, you can't attack them like that.
Mom, you kill and eat people.
I kill and eat people because I have to.
I hit him with a tray because I had to.
Your mother has a medical condition.
That comparison is offensive.
- Right?
- Right.
I'm just worried about your future.
You could get expelled.
I'm not getting expelled.
Principal Novak couldn't get anyone to talk.
No loose ends.
I learned that from you.
Mostly from your mistakes.
Yes, we're not good at murder.
I happen to believe that's a positive quality.
And what I find most upsetting is that you don't seem to have any remorse.
- I don't.
- None?
Do you want me to lie and say that I do?
Of course not.
Right?
What's happening to her?
Are we raising a monster?
I don't know.
She's seen so much crazy stuff lately.
I shouldn't have ripped apart that Serbian guy in front of her.
Looking back, I might've handled that differently.
I killed her best friend's stepdad and put his body in our bathtub.
That's not a story I'm gonna tell at her wedding.
- Oh, no.
My finger's oozing again.
- Oh, Jesus.
Are we kidding ourselves?
What if we can't keep all these balls up?
We have to.
It's so overwhelming.
Abby, stopping a clam plague, and now work's gotten weird.
Our new sheriff neighbor is looking into the murder of our old sheriff neighbor.
I just wish you could eat chicken.
All right, our first priority is getting Abby back on track.
So tomorrow, we take her to see that boy she hit - and we make her apologize.
- Good idea.
As the great juggler Francisco Garibaldi once said, "When there's fear in your heart and knives in the air, the wise juggler focuses on but a single blade".
What's with you and the juggling?
I saw a cool documentary about a juggler.
You should watch it.
- I'm not going to watch it.
- It has a great twist.
Tell me about it.
He had four wives and 18 children, and none of them knew about each other.
He was juggling balls and families.
Wow.
That's crazy.
I would've liked to have watched that.
You can still watch it.
No.
You ruined it.
I can't believe you guys are actually making me do this.
You apologized to all your victims?
Let's stop comparing our behaviors.
Someday, if you have kids, and you get a virus, and start killing people, you'll appreciate how well your mother and I are doing.
It's true.
And then you're gonna call and be like, "Mom, oh, my God, this is so hard".
And I'll say, "Mm-hmm".
We know over the last few weeks, we haven't been as focused on parenting as we should have.
But starting now, we're gonna be more hands-on.
And lesson number one is when you hurt somebody - Like by killing them?
- No.
This is about you.
When you do something wrong, you take responsibility.
By turning yourself into the police?
No, still on you.
You apologize.
- To the loved ones you've left behind?
- I'm done.
Your turn.
Apologize or you're not getting your iPad back.
So blackmailing me into saying something I don't believe is your idea of good parenting?
So, you admit it is parenting.
Fine.
Let's get this over with.
Impressive house.
Great curb appeal.
Yeah.
If this goes well, maybe we can leave our card.
Hello.
We're Joel and Sheila Hammond.
I'm not used to using our actual names.
Yeah, weird.
And I believe you know our daughter Abby.
I've seen her.
She came here today to apologize.
Isn't that right, Abby?
- That's correct.
- Sounds like you don't really want to.
Nope.
Tight.
Come on in.
Lovely home.
And we should know because we sell a lot of homes.
High-end homes like this one.
Oh, my God.
Hello.
I'm one half of a father-son seafood distribution company.
I'm the son.
Anyway, my dad can't be here.
Well, not that he's an absent father.
Far from it.
We do a lot of things together tennis, word puzzles.
Sometimes we just sit quietly side by side, and that's all right, too.
What do you want?
Right, we want to be your new seafood distributor.
We could do it on a trial basis.
Maybe start with clams.
Who sells you your clams?
We don't serve a lot of clams.
Maybe because you are swimming with the wrong clammers.
What'd you say your clam guy's name was?
Why do you keep bringing up clams?
Am I?
Because you're the one who brought it up last.
Listen, I'm not sure what's going on here, but you should go.
Understood.
My father and I respect your decision to stay with who did you say your clam guy was?
- Get out.
- Very good.
-  -   Dare I?
That corn dog smells really great.
It's the last one.
Fair enough.
So, what Abby came to say was Christian, I really am sorry that something went so wrong in your early relationships with women that you ended up being such an irredeemable douchebag.
Abby.
I've decided I don't need my iPad back.
Phones have gotten big enough.
If my relationships are so messed up, then why did I have sex at age 13?
Boom.
Whoa.
Buddy, there's a lot to unpack there.
Guys, let's stop with all the name-calling and the unsettling sexual revelations and just get back to why we're here.
And, please, let's keep it civil.
-  -  Ding-dong, we're home.
Fuck me.
- You two.
- Chris?
Christa?
Christian is your son?
Oh, I see what you've done there.
Wow.
What are you doing in our house?
Our daughter felt great remorse for hitting your son with a tray and came to apologize.
- She hit our son with a tray?
- Only in the face.
-  - I'm Abby.
If you guys want to sell your home, these two are the best.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Did she hurt you?
- Mom, I'm fine.
- You didn't know?
Mom, Dr. Fineman says you shouldn't squeeze my face anymore without my permission.
- Dad!
- He did say that, sweetie.
Well, sounds like we've triggered a healthy discussion, so we're gonna scoot.
- Why didn't the school call us?
- Because there wasn't any proof.
But as proactive parents, we felt compelled to have our daughter come and apologize, which I think we can all agree has been done.
Well, now there is proof, isn't there?
I'm not following, and we have to scoot.
You just admitted it.
Your daughter assaulted our son.
And we're going to notify Principal Novak and have her expelled.
Oh, this is delicious.
You two came over here and told us something we never would have known.
And now we're going to strap it on and fuck you with it.
Go, Mom!
Your daughter is not going to graduate high school, which is ironic because you two are the idiots.
How would you like it if I put my foot so far up your perfect little ass, you won't find it again until you shit it out on Christmas morning?
Go, Mom!
Honey, remember why we're here trying to keep Abby on the right path.
Let's not touch anyone in a way Dr. Fineman wouldn't approve of.
Sheila, what is your safe word?
Because I want to know what to ignore when I'm making you my bitch.
You're just lucky that I'm here to set an example for my daughter because otherwise, I would literally turn you inside out.
Look, let's take a breath.
We're all "realators" here.
Actually, we're "realtors".
We don't know what a "real-ator" is.
You know what, Chris?
Fuck you.
How about this?
We won't tell Principal Novak what Abby did and get her expelled if you give us the listing you stole from us with that dog stunt.
You are never gonna get that listing.
And we didn't steal it.
We won it.
In high school, your dad drove drunk and flipped a car.
You have until 5:00 tonight to decide.
That is our best and final offer.
Oh, that's an expression "realtors" use, so you may not be familiar with it.
Christian, did you know that your mom sold me a Quaalude once?
Well, I think this has shown us why everyone here has such fucked-up kids.
Shall we scoot?
I hate these people.
They're so mean.
And this house.
A mudroom in Santa Clarita?
- It rains twice a year.
Fools.
- We cannot let them win this.
Grace Tinsler got expelled, and now she's homeschooled and has 200,000 YouTube followers.
And all she does is whisper ingredients from cereal boxes.
You're not getting expelled.
And you're not what'd you say she does?
She whispers ingredients into a camera.
It's a non-sexual fetish thing.
It pays her parents' mortgage.
If it pays her parents' mortgage, it's a sex thing.
Maybe we should give them the listing.
No.
We can't lose that commission.
And even if we give them what they want, what's to keep them from blackmailing us again?
They may want our next listing.
And then the one after that.
And then they'll own us.
That's true.
Like Dan.
Maybe even worse.
He wanted us to kill for him.
But to his credit, he never spoke so explicitly about our bodies.
Yeah, these people really belong in a bigger city.
Okay, we need to get ahead of this.
We need to get to Novak before they do.
And then Abby can apologize and show some remorse.
I'm not sorry.
Show some remorse, all right?
You might get a slap on the wrist and not expelled.
It's what people do when they plead guilty to get a lesser sentence.
Murderers do it all the time.
I've been looking into it.
I don't think it's a great idea to just show up at his house.
The last time we dropped by, we trashed it and assaulted his grandmother.
He might remember that.
- You have a better idea?
- Yeah.
Oh, better?
No.
Hey!
What the hell are you doing?
This isn't the bathroom.
Novak better get home soon.
We have that investor meeting in an hour.
Investor meeting.
Sounds important.
Plus, it's 140 degrees in here, so let's bail and get food.
Maybe a corn dog.
That moment's passed.
Now I want sweets.
No, we are staying here until he gets home and you can say you're sorry for what you did.
- I'm not sorry.
- We don't care.
You need to tell him that you are.
Yeah, 'cause you don't want Chris and Christa to win.
Because we are overwhelmed and we don't know if our family is going to make it!
I'm sorry, but you always say you want to be included in our world.
That's our world.
It's been really hard lately, sweetie.
Every day something new is thrown at us.
Yesterday, I bit my finger off.
What?
It's okay, it's getting better.
I'm like a snowman.
What?
A year ago, losing a finger would've been the headline of the Christmas newsletter.
Now it wouldn't even be in the "This 'n' That" section.
And you hit someone in the face with a tray and might get expelled, so we feel like we're failing you as parents.
What do you mean we might not make it?
Your mother and I will always do everything to keep this family going.
But right now, we could really use your help.
He's home.
Principal Novak!
Oh, God.
It's all three of them.
Ah!
We just want to talk to you.
Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
What?
What do you want from me?
First of all, I hope you're okay.
Second, thanks for not pressing charges after I broke some things in your lovely home.
I wanted to, but my grandmother wouldn't allow it.
It's her house, so she always gets her way, right down to the flavor of sherbet that I'm allowed to enjoy.
Well, we're grateful either way.
But the reason we're here is because Abby has something to tell you.
Right, Abby?
- I did hit Christian with a tray.
-  I knew it!
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused everyone.
I didn't handle the situation in the best way.
It's just when I saw Christian posting texts from Janie and how humiliated she felt, I snapped.
I had to do something.
I had to help her.
Okay, that's nonsense because there were 200 other people in that cafeteria, and none of them did what you did.
No, they didn't.
And I accept full responsibility for my actions.
Thank you.
Coming forward was the right and correct thing to do.
- Now you are expelled.
- What?
- Hold on.
- I think you missed the point.
- Our daughter - Is a hooligan, as you all are.
And now she is expelled!
And if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go inside and I'm gonna have two scoops of sherbet because my grandmother is away, hopefully failing her driver's test.
Well, wait.
- Wait!
- Leave me be!
Sorry, team.
I failed.
- You didn't fail, honey.
- No.
You did great.
What are you talking about?
I got expelled.
There were 200 kids in that cafeteria, and you were the only one that did anything to help that poor girl.
- Maybe it wasn't the best thing.
- Yeah, don't do that again.
- But you did something.
- That's right.
Maybe we're not raising a monster.
Maybe we're raising a superhero.
Wait, you thought I was a monster?
Shh.
Shit!
Wow!
Your finger's gone.
Where'd it go?
- I don't know.
I had it in the car.
- Think it fell off in the yard?
Now I'm guessing Novak slammed it in the door.
- Maybe we should go.
- I want my finger.
I know, but it's gonna be so awkward.
We already said goodbye.
Yeah.
I want my finger.
I know, I know.
Damn it!
Hold on.
I have an idea.
My finger!
You cut off my wife's finger!
This is an emergency!
There's no time to think!
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
- Oh, my God.
I'm in so much pain!
- Quickly, to the hospital.
- I'm so sorry!
Please don't sue me!
We won't if you don't expel Abby.
Yes.
Otherwise, you'll be hearing from the law offices of Martin L. Taylor.
All right.
All right.
Let's say three days of suspension.
We can live with that.
- I'll get some ice for your finger.
- That's okay.
This will work.
My sherbet.
My spoon.
Suck it, Chris and Christa!
Our daughter's getting suspended.
The Hammonds, taking a step forward!
- Abby, getting her iPad back!
-  Eric, programming his picture into my phone.
Nobody wants that.
Hey, buddy.
I messed up, Joel.
I went to Japopo's to try to find the clam distributor and I snuck into the owner's office and he saw me and got pissed.
Now I'm locked in here and I can't get out.
- Why did you go there?
- Because you were busy.
I wanted to help you.
I love being helpful.
All right, I'll be right over.
Please tell me that I don't have to pretend we're partners in a father-son seafood business.
Oh, Jesus.
I have to go help Eric.
It's almost 4:00.
We have that investor meeting.
Plus, Mom's finger came off.
That seems important.
Right.
Okay.
We have a lot of knives in the air.
As wise jugglers, "We must each focus on but a single blade".
I think Dad spent too much time in a hot car.
No, he's fine.
He just saw something on television, and now he's living his life by it.
Abby, help your mother reattach her finger.
It's not that hard.
- Gross.
Got it.
- I'll deal with the Eric situation.
And Carl's not gonna be at that meeting, right?
Nope.
So I won't be stressed and start snacking on myself.
- I'll just go on my own.
- Great!
The Hammonds, getting shit done!
The Hammonds, making it look easy.
The Hammonds, standing for too long with a severed finger in the street.
Yeah, we should go.
Hey, Mark.
Joel!
Hey, thanks for that Yelp review, buddy.
Brought in a bunch of new customers.
How's that tipping documentary coming, huh?
My wife, she bought a beautiful new dress for the interview.
Oh.
I lost the financing.
So, unless you know anyone who's got $2 million  Actually, I do know a guy.
Oh.
Um Anyway, I'm also part of a father-son seafood distribution company - and, apparently, my boy - Whoa.
Is that your son in my office?
That's him?
What the hell's going on here, hmm?
There's no way you and that kid are seafood distributors.
No, we're not.
Well, at least tell me you're really making a tipping documentary my wife's gonna be in.
God damn it.
Sorry, Mark, it's complicated.
But, please, I promise I'll never lie to you again if you'll just let my only son out of your office.
Let him out?
He can go whenever he wants.
He locked himself in there.
- What?
- Yeah.
Eric.
Open the door.
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
He yelled, I panicked.
The longer I was in here, the angrier he got.
I'm a coward, Joel.
Behold.
The me behind the mask.
You pissed off the owner.
Now he's never gonna help me.
Sorry, humankind, can't save you.
Eric went rogue, so everyone has to eat each other.
Actually, maybe they won't.
I found this in the file cabinet.
Japopo's has a regular seafood distributor, but the day Sheila got sick, for some reason, they bought their clams from this place.
"Ruby's Clams".
Oh, my God, this is it.
This is where the clams that turned Sheila came from.
You found it, Eric.
- Did you want me to hug you?
- No, we don't have to hug.
That's right.
We're men of the sea.
Sometimes we just walk quietly side by side.
That's all right, too.
- Hmm?
- Hmm?
Okay.
Carl!
I thought you weren't coming.
I changed my mind.
I wanted to make sure you didn't fuck it up.
Okay, well, I'll be in in a minute.
I just need to put some lipstick on.
You look fine.
Yeah, okay.
Oh.
Carl, you parked a little close.
Would you mind?
Hurry up!
And don't talk too much.
You sound like a know-it-all.
No.
Where's that stress ball?
Okay.
I can do this.
I can do this.
I can do this.
-  Honey!
-  - What's going on?
- I'm going to that investor meeting.
It's 4:00 a.m. That was 12 hours ago!
I've been looking everywhere for you!
Where have you been?
I don't know.
The last thing I remember is I was parking and then Carl pulled up, and then I had to grab my stress ball and started squeezing it -  -  Oh, shit!
Carl?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Oh, my God!
Is that Carl's heart?
Did you kill Carl?
- I don't know.
Maybe?
- How could you not know?
I saw him in the parking lot and he was yelling at me and then I woke up here.
It must be some kind of a blackout.
- You have no memory of what happened?
- No.
Nothing.
Okay.
Maybe that's not a human heart.
Maybe that's an animal heart.
That would be so great and totally legal.
Definitely human.
Fresh from the chest.
This sucks!
This really sucks!
I'm not mad at you.
I'm mad at the situation.
Where did you put the body?
"Situation"?
"The situation" doesn't remember.
Come on, let's get you inside and figure out what to do.
- Where's my other boot?
- I don't know.
Is there even the slightest chance you traded it for a human heart?
Carl's not here, just some leftover Nazis and a chunk of Serb.
Gary said you didn't go to the other unit either.
Then he told me a story about meeting Paul Shaffer at a car wash.
It was actually pretty funny.
- Honey.
- Yeah, it can wait.
He had this super tiny cat with him.
Remind me later.
All right, it's almost morning.
We'll go to the office like normal.
If Carl shows up, great.
If we hear that he's dead, we'll act surprised.
- Oh, God, that's crazy.
- You have a better idea?
- No, that was me acting surprised.
- No way.
Seriously?
- Yeah.
Pretty good, right?
- That was me acting surprised.
Oh, nice.
We got this.
Hey, it's Carl Coby.
Leave me a message.
Pat, what do I press when I'm done?
Pat!
Hey, it's Sheila.
I felt bad I missed the meeting, so I wanted to leave you a recording of where I was yesterday.
I addressed a problem with my daughter from 2:00 to 5:00, had dinner with my husband from 5:00 to 7:00, then went to bed where I stayed until morning.
I hope you're well.
Love you.
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to hearing that at the trial.
He's not here and Pat hasn't heard from him.
Plus, he missed his first meeting this morning.
Oh, God, I killed him.
After he yelled at you yesterday, you must've snapped, brought him to another location, attacked him, and ripped out his heart.
Oh, fuck!
I didn't even get to enjoy it.
Just straight to consequences.
It's like pushing cake all the way down your throat, right to your thighs.
This is the second coworker we've killed.
- When they find Carl's body - That's it.
I'm going to prison.
I'm so sorry, honey.
We're not giving up.
You're not going to prison.
I love you.
- I'm gonna miss you so much.
- Don't talk like that.
Promise me you'll find that clam distributor and figure out what caused this so it won't happen to anyone else.
I will.
No, we will.
And when Abby gets married, there should be peach roses everywhere.
She'll say it's too much, but don't listen to her.
God damn it!
You didn't kill Carl.
- I didn't kill Carl.
- Hotcha!
Wait.
Then who did you kill?
Some random person!
That's still not great.
Sheila, what the fuck happened to you yesterday?
- Hey, Joel.
- Carl.
I see you in the parking lot, and then you just drive away?
I mean, I couldn't pitch your bullshit eco-homes to the investor.
I had to pull a "Mad Men" and take him to a strip club all night.
But isn't it great that you're healthy enough to enjoy the female form?
All you had to do was show up and not be a know-it-all.
You couldn't even do that.
I'm sorry, Carl.
But you know what?
The last few days have been impossible.
You want me to be your meek yes-woman, but that's not who I am anymore.
I have opinions, and that's a good thing, because a workplace is stronger when everybody has a voice.
Yeah, that sounds like a pain in the ass.
You're fired.
What?
You're firing us?
No, just you.
Joel can stay.
Uhh I rescheduled the meeting with the investor for 5:00 tonight.
Can you make it?
Uhh Great.
He's alive.
Carl took me by surprise.
I didn't know what to say!
How about, "Sheila and I are a team, Carl.
We've always been a team.
And I would sooner slit my throat than betray my goddess wife".
He cut me off.
I would've gotten there.
So, any thoughts on who you did kill?
Uh Are you thinking about it or just doing me?
Uh Oh, I get it.
Is this gonna be a thing?
Uh Oh, my God.
It could be the police!
I'm going to jail.
We'll fight this, sweetheart.
It's a disease.
It wasn't your fault.
Don't you dare spend a penny of Abby's college fund on my legal team.
It's Lisa!
Oh, thank God.
I know you're home.
Pull out, pull out, wherever you are.
Wow.
Thank you, Sheila!
You're welcome?
I thought about what you told me last night, and I'm gonna do it!
Hooray?
Do you guys have any milk?
I can't keep any in the house.
Eric goes through like a gallon a day.
- What did you tell her?
- I don't know!
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't think so, honey.
You were there.
- Did you tell Joel yet?
- Not yet.
Well, tell him.
Well, Lisa here Oh, my God, I will tell him.
As you know, Anne is very religious.
Without going into too much detail, she refuses to get her tongue pierced and go down on me until I accept Jesus as my Savior.
Thank you for keeping it vague.
So, last night when Anne and I ran into Sheila, she gave me the push that I needed, and I decided to get baptized!
I convinced Lisa to get adult baptized.
That's a thing I did.
- Morning, elders.
- Hi, honey.
Abba-dabs!
So, where did you all meet up, Lisa?
And at what time, and what else did you discuss?
I grew up without sisters, so I love hearing what women talk about when there are no men around.
Were men around?
Oh, Sheila was just out front, going to her car, and, God, you were on fire.
You were like, "Get baptized!
Live your truth!
Every body is a bikini body"!
Oh, and you really helped Anne.
Well, tell Joel what I did.
- Because he is loving this.
- I am.
Anne's been fixated on these missing people in Santa Clarita.
Your wife was all, "Stop thinking about work and use the creative side of your fucking brain".
And then she slapped her ass.
Sometimes I do that to make a point.
Right, honey?
It's new and I love it.
Well, it got the message across.
Anne marched straight to my garage, set up her easel, and she has been painting ever since.
I got Anne off her crazy investigating and into painting.
- Good for me, right?
- Good for you.
Yeah, you deserved that lobster.
Hm?
You said something about getting your dinner out of a lobster tank.
Hm Oh, God damn it!
We're out of frozen strawberries.
- I just bought some.
- No, Dad.
Come look.
The lack of strawberries is appalling.
Nope.
No strawberries.
Just your leftover lobster from last night.
Ooh, I make a mean lobster scramble.
No!
I don't mean to be rude, but you told me all these things I already know because I was there.
So if you don't mind, I gotta start my day.
Look at this attitude.
You gonna slap my ass?
Come on, slap it.
Come on.
Hey, your mom is so fierce, especially in those red boots you were wearing last night.
I mean, Anne is obsessed with them.
Would you hate it if I got her exactly the same ones?
Not at all.
But they don't sell them in my kitchen, so Lisa, I'll walk with you.
I have to talk to Eric anyway.
You two spend so much time together.
When are you gonna date?
We're just friends.
You know, Eric's too shy to tell you, but he has a lovely you-know-what.
When he was born, all the nurses said it was impressive, but not ostentatious.
These are Professional nurses, talking like that?
It's Boone's Nazi friend.
The one who sold us raffle tickets.
I guess even in a blackout, I knew not to kill Carl, so I rage-killed a Nazi.
Why'd you bring him here?
I must've remembered the storage unit freezer was full.
Pretty smart gal, that blackout Sheila.
I wonder where she gets it.
He's wearing his work uniform.
Maybe you killed him at "NMS Impound & Tow".
Oh, my God.
Maybe that's where I left my boot.
The one Sheriff Anne is obsessed with, and if she sees at a bloody crime scene, she'll immediately connect to you?
"Yes, that one," she answers with a less judgmental tone in her voice.
We need to get to that impound yard.
There could be witnesses, other body parts.
You could've slapped bloody handprints on who knows how many dead asses.
Oh, my God, witnesses!
I remember something.
What?
There was a tall man in a red shirt waving at me.
Let's go.
- Hey.
- Abby, hi.
Is your dad checking out that Japopo's clam distributor we found yesterday?
No, he got distracted.
There's a dead guy in our freezer, and they don't know how he got there.
But I've ruled out suicide.
I once found my mom's vibrator in the vegetable crisper.
Ooh.
Okay, here are the ideas I worked up for the fracking billboard.
So, vandalism doesn't come naturally to me, but two Mountain Dews, and the beast is off its leash!
Sugar-high Eric!
Drink that go-go juice.
Yeah!
But seriously, if I try to have more, do not let me.
- Okay.
- All right.
This is what the fracking site looks like now.
Ugh.
"Energy that turns on your future".
And this is what it will look like tonight, after we paint it.
"Energy that turns off your future".
Asterisk "By polluting the water table with carcinogens".
And then a really long URL.
Booyah.
Citing my sources.
The beast strikes again.
Okay.
Building on that, what if, instead, we just write "Fracking Kills" and then make it look like blood's coming out of the family's eyes?
That's so much better.
Two beasts in the junkyard.
Watch out.
Okay, paint the sign tonight, film it with a drone tomorrow, and post it on YouTube.
People see what's in their own backyard and the opposition begins.
- Yeah!
- Fuck yeah!
Wanna go halvsies on a Dew?
- No.
- Good idea.
Okay, are you sure you can get a drone?
Uh, yeah, I won a Parrot AR off Fenton Hoffstadter in an all-or-nothing game OF  The Gathering.
Okay.
Bunch of words I'm not super familiar with.
I beat a boy at a game and now he's giving me his toy.
Great!
I was thinking it would be super helpful if we had your stepdad's night vision goggles tonight.
It would, but after your dad killed him, my mom locked up all of Dan's psycho cop stuff and won't let me anywhere near it.
For no good reason.
Uh-huh.
What's the reason?
I got busted using the goggles to observe an owl.
It was perched above the Andersons' bedroom window.
They thought I was watching them have sex.
As if their unremarkable human forms could hold a candle to the feathered glory of a Western Screech Owl.
Well, your mom loves me.
I'll ask for the goggles.
Oh, excellent.
- Pick you up at 8:00?
- Yeah.
Are you gonna eat before?
I'll be too nervous.
I thought maybe we could go out after.
Yeah, that would be great.
This is exciting!
Yes, totally.
Well, till tonight.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Lisa?
Oh, Abby.
Hey.
I was just reading the Bible, getting up to speed for my baptism.
- Have you read this?
- No.
- Damn.
- I was just on my way out.
- While I'm here, can I ask you a favor?
- Of course.
You know, as Jesus says Oh, fuck, I'll never be able to fake this.
What's up?
Eric mentioned that Dan had some night vision goggles lying around.
I was just wondering if I could borrow them.
- It's for a school project.
- On what?
On nighttime.
What happens at night, anyway?
- I'm gonna find out.
- Is this for Eric to look at owls?
Because I can't have Neal Anderson storming over again yelling at me about parenting while standing there in sweatpants with half an erection.
All right.
It's for me and Eric.
We kinda have this special thing planned in the desert tonight.
Oh, my God.
Are you going on a date?
Tell me you are.
Yes.
We're going on a date.
It's finally happening.
This is incredible!
You pray one time.
Let me get those for you.
You know, when Dan disappeared, I locked up all of his crazy shit.
Wait.
You're suspended today, right?
Yeah.
Why?
I'm making you up.
No, thank you.
If you want the goggles - Fine.
- Yay!
Yay.
Is that the tall man in a red shirt who was waving at you?
Yeah.
Now that I think about it, he was incredibly limber.
There's no police tape.
Well, we should check inside and see if I strung up anyone's entrails like Christmas lights.
I've been dreaming about that lately.
I think I'm excited for the holidays.
Hang on.
We don't want anyone to see us.
We should wait for them to leave.
Yeah, although they are teenage girls, so I'm sure we're invisible to them.
Okay, I'll admit it.
Carl and I were not a great match.
It's good I won't be working with him anymore.
Thank you.
I'm glad you are able to accept So I was thinking we could work somewhere else.
There's an opening at Principal Residential.
Chris and Christa's company?
The woman threatened to fuck us with a strap-on!
Well, don't be sexist, Joel.
If Elon Musk threatened to fuck us with a strap-on, you'd call it leadership.
I don't think I would.
Fine.
There are other companies we could work with.
All of them with bosses who you might not like.
So what, you're just gonna keep working for Carl without me?
All I'm saying is we can't afford to both be out of a job.
Whoo!
They're leaving.
Did they break it?
Fucking teenagers!
We should report them.
Absolutely.
Right after we check on my murder.
I don't see any blood or junk body parts.
There's no one in the office or on the office walls.
Shit!
Is that a camera?
Shit!
It is!
- What do we do?
- I don't know.
- This doesn't look like human behavior.
- No.
If there's a camera Then there could be a recording of me eating a man alive.
And that really won't look like human behavior.
You've been so good for Eric.
Before you, the only girl he talked to was his cousin.
That was headed in a weird direction.
She's super pushy.
Eric's good for me, too.
I can really depend on him, you know?
It feels like my face is suffocating.
I'm just giving you a little war paint to match your personality.
Eric told me what you did to defend that poor girl in the cafeteria.
- Oh, it wasn't a big deal.
- Well, I think it was.
I've been watching you over the past couple weeks, and you have a fire in you that you didn't have before.
You're a doer, a woman of action.
Thanks, Lisa.
My life's been kind of intense lately.
I guess that made me think more about what's important.
Close.
Okay, if this is too slutty, I can change it.
And if it's not slutty enough, I can fix that, too.
Any excuse to get out the body glitter.
And done.
Okay, come look in the mirror while I grab those goggles.
What do you think?
Whoa.
You hate it?
No.
It's awesome.
Because you're awesome.
So many people play it safe, but not you.
Here you go.
You're just like your mom.
The Hammond women, they go big or go home.
Yeah.
We do.
Hey.
- You're Abby Hammond's friend, right?
- Oh, uh We're a little more than friends.
There's a 3% chance we might someday become lovers.
Her words.
Dude, I lost my virginity when I was 13, so - What do you got there?
- Um, it's a drone.
Specifically a Parrot AR 2.0.
What?
That's sick!
That's Yeah.
I'm gonna go ahead and keep this.
Thanks, bro.
Wait, what?
What?
No!
You can't just take things!
Come on, man, we're almost adults!
Hey!
Christian.
You're gonna hit me with that?
Give me my drone.
No.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Hello?
- Anyone here?
Hey, buddy.
Working alone?
Let's look around.
We go through a lot of dish gloves.
Yeah, well, we kill a lot of people.
And sometimes do dishes.
I know.
I just worry about our carbon footprint.
We do our part.
You know what happens every time we kill someone?
They drive less.
Yeah.
It's still AJ's shift.
The next guy starts in a half-hour, so we have to hurry.
Here are the monitors.
So, do you think I should just not work at all?
I don't know, honey.
Because killing and eating people can't be the only thing that I do.
Then I'd just be a monster.
Well, you could have hobbies.
You like hiking, getting out into nature.
You know who else likes hiking and nature?
Well-known monster Bigfoot.
Just because one monster does those things doesn't mean he gets to own them.
Wait, there you are.
Stop.
No one but AJ is around.
You're just staring at him.
Wow.
Where's that patience when you're waiting for me to finish using the hair dryer?
I've only been waiting on AJ for an hour.
Here he comes.
Oh, I remember this.
He was mad 'cause I was staring at him.
He thought it was creepy.
He pushed you!
You can't just do that to someone.
Yeah, well, spoiler alert, this does end with his torso in our freezer.
- Oh!
- Whoa!
- You've gotten really good at that.
- Thanks!
Anne's been teaching me.
I wish I could show her this.
She'd be so impressed.
No, I can't.
Wait, that's it?
I just left?
We didn't see any blood outside.
Maybe you didn't kill him here.
Maybe you followed him later Whoa!
Wow.
That was intense.
Yeah.
Oh, my God, you're using the boot to kill his brain.
But where did the boot go?
The dog!
All we have to do is get inside this guy's mind.
Hey, buddy.
Where do you hide things?
Where on this vast lot do you stash your secret Oh.
Under your butt.
We got it.
Look at you cleaning up.
Just delete it and we'll get out of here.
Are you okay?
When I'm killing someone, it all feels natural, but watching myself?
Maybe you're right.
I shouldn't be around people.
You should keep working with Carl without me.
We could just try it for a little while, see how it feels.
Yeah.
I'll prep you for that investor meeting today.
Okay.
Twenty-year partnership.
It was a good run.
And we'll still be married, of course.
And we have Abby, and the house, and cars.
Are you just listing things we have in common?
Patio furniture.
The hair dryer.
That's it.
It's done.
Yeah.
It was like it never happened.
Got the goggles.
So, about tonight Whoa, hey, wow.
Look at your face.
Oh, too much?
No!
No, you look amazing.
- Thank you!
- Like a sexy raccoon.
Mm?
They said I'd be better with girls when I got my braces off, but I don't see it.
Your mom got to me.
So, about tonight, I'm having some second thoughts.
- Oh, man, thank God.
- Okay.
Me, too.
Right, because graffiti on a billboard isn't enough.
I saw these crazy explosives in Dan's closet.
I'm thinking, if we really wanna make an impact, we should blow up the trailer on the fracking site.
- Holy shit.
- I know.
Go big or go home, right?
- I can't do that.
- Well, don't worry.
We're not gonna do it tonight.
We'll plan it out.
No, I can't do any of that.
I don't even wanna do the graffiti.
- What?
- The other day, when you called me a badass, I wanted to be that guy.
I tried to be that guy, but I'm not.
You can be.
We'll get you a couple of Mountain Dews.
Abby, I'm sorry.
I'm out.
Oh.
Okay.
We can still get something to eat tonight, if you want.
No, I should go home, do some research on this stuff.
Right.
Another time?
Sure.
Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
With eco-homes, you save money and the planet, because living right is the right way to live.
This is just the kind of shit my dad would've hated if he were alive.
Let's do it.
Yeah, fuck your dad!
God rest his soul.
- Impressive work, Joel.
- Impressive work, Joel!
- Thanks, Todd.
- Thanks, Todd!
Carl's pretty excited.
Carl's pretty excited!
- Honey?
- I'm in here!
Oh, thank you.
You're cleaning the freezer.
Yeah.
I took AJ to the storage unit and de-boned him so he'd fit in that.
And I've almost got this one back to normal, although the ice cubes keep coming out red.
- How was the pitch?
- I crushed it.
That's so great.
Yay for the Hammon d. - And then I quit.
- What?
After the meeting, Carl was breaking out the scotch.
I realized I didn't get into this because I love real estate.
I got into this because I love you.
"Hammond Realty"?
If we can't work for someone else, we'll work for ourselves.
Really?
You wanna start our own company?
I just spent nine dollars on this sample business card, so there's no turning back.
Well, I love it, because working with you for 20 years wasn't enough.
Then let's do 20 more.
You wanna go upstairs and do things to each other?
Hotcha.
This morning, I thought there was no way this day would end well, but we figured out who I murdered.
And we never have to see Carl again.
And, even in a blackout, I got Anne to stop looking into our murders and start painting.
It all worked out pretty well.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
-  - Hmm.
- Hello.
- Hi there.
- Is this Ruby's Clams?
- Yeah, and I'm Ruby.
Oh, good morning, I'm Irving Zweeben.
I got your address from Japopo's.
- Are you a clam distributor?
- Well, I'm trying to be.
It's a mom-and-pop operation, minus the pop.
Got a shit ton of snap and crackle, though.
What's your story, Irv?
Well, I'm an amateur clam grower.
A "clamateur," if you will.
I just had a few questions about going pro.
Such as where do you get your clam seeds?
How many have you grown?
What other restaurants have you sold them to?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
You gotta put a clam in a hot bath before she opens up.
Why don't you come inside the house?
I'd love to.
But first, would you like a Danish?
I don't know what you eat or don't eat, but they're very good.
Oh, I couldn't.
I'm on a diet.
I see.
Ah, fuck it.
Mm!
That is good.
Yeah.
You looked nervous, like I wasn't gonna like your Danish or something.
Well, I put a little nutmeg in it, and I'm always afraid someone's gonna say, "Whoa, nutmeg"?
I like you, Irv.
Come on, I'm gonna show you something special.
Then maybe I'll show you my clams.
Starting your own real estate business, huh?
That's exciting.
I'll be praying for you.
Ugh, thanks.
I really need this to work.
I cost us our last job because my boss was such a fucker.
Sorry.
Jerk.
My fucking boss was such a jerk!
Whoa, easy there, coconut hands.
Coconut hands?
Yeah, it's an expression for people who hit really hard.
You know, because coconuts are so hard.
I came up with it myself.
Well, I really think it's gonna catch on because that's so easy to explain.
I think your new business is gonna do really well.
I mean, you're so strong and tough on the outside, and sweet on the inside.
You're like, um Well, I wanna say something else, but the best example is a coconut.
Okay, I guess I see how you could get there again.
Plus, you're so inspiring.
I mean, you got me to start painting again for Pete's sake.
You're just really awesome, Sheila.
Ugh.
That's so nice.
-  -  Holy guacamole!
Are you okay?
Oh, boy, getting hit in the face hurts.
- Do you want me to get you some ice?
- No, it's, um it's better now.
I'm glad your painting's going well.
I'd love to see it.
It's just over at Lisa's, right?
Yeah, but it's not that good.
I'm sure it's great.
Come on, don't be such a All I can think of is coconut.
It's a series.
I call it "Suspicious Objects".
Wow.
-  - Yeah?
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi, Eric.
Just stopped by to see if your dad needed help checking out the clam distributor.
I don't know if you heard, but to get the name, I had to engage in a pretty dangerous game of cat and mouse.
- You were the mouse, right?
- I also wanted to see if you were mad I bailed on blowing up the fracking trailer with you.
But then you just called me a "mouse," so I guess that's a yes?
I'm not mad.
I'm just busy, okay?
My dad's not here.
If you wanna let him know you came by, you could always leave a trail of tiny droppings on the kitchen counter.
Okay.
I'm not comfortable doing something illegal, but if you want to, that's fine, I'm not judging.
Are you making your own explosives?
That's crazy!
What's wrong with you?
I'm exploring options.
You bailed, so you don't get to have an opinion, okay?
Nobody likes a backseat arsonist.
All right.
Just so you know, you should be careful using a hydrocarbon-based fuel as an accelerant, all right, because it's More volatile than available combustibles.
I know, Eric.
But thank you for mouse-splaining explosives to me.
Well, I could call you an animal, too.
You're like an Indian mealmoth who flies directly into a flame because it read one book from 1971 and now it knows everything.
Yeah, well, at least a mealmoth has friends it can rely on who won't flutter away at the first sign of trouble.
You know nothing of moths.
Although, that was unbelievably accurate.
- Look at all these clams.
- I grow them all right here.
They say you can't get local seafood in the desert, but I'm gonna prove those fuckers wrong.
- Would you like a drink, Irv?
- No, I'm good.
And have you proved those fuckers wrong?
How many restaurants have you sold these to?
So far, just Japopo's.
That was my trial batch.
Oh, my God.
Really?
Just Japopo's.
No one else has had these?
No, not even me.
I'm allergic.
Shellfish makes my tongue swell up.
Not that I'm against things swelling up.
Okey-dokey.
Listen, Ruby, I wanna buy all of these.
All three tanks.
Oh, no, these aren't for sale.
These are my house clams.
Yeah, that's Kevin.
There's James, Alex, Peter Hold up.
If these are your friends, which ones did you sell to Japopo's?
The ones out back.
Jesus Christ.
They're one of a kind.
My brother explores deepwater lakes all over the world.
He's one of those rich assholes who develops a dangerous hobby.
Anyway, he found a few of these in some cave 90 meters deep.
He knows I love clams so he smuggled a few through Customs for me to breed.
Family.
What would we do without them?
- Where was this lake?
- Somewhere in Serbia.
Serbia.
I call them "Ruby Reds".
Be careful, they bite.
How many of these are there?
Well, six months ago, I had four, but they breed like crazy, and now I have 5,000.
Tomorrow, I'm shipping them out to restaurants all over the state.
Oh, my God.
Ruby, listen to me.
You can't sell these.
They made people sick.
What are you talking about?
Japopo's didn't complain.
They didn't know!
All right, what would it cost for me to buy all these "Ruby Reds" right now?
I'm not selling them to you.
I have buyers lined up.
If this goes well, I can quit my job at the Sleep Apnea Center.
Won't have to strap wires to those fat fucks and listen to them snore all night.
First of all, no matter how this goes, you should quit your job.
And these clams are dangerous.
They have to be destroyed.
Who are you?
You're not a clam hobbyist.
Do you work for Akana International Ocean Meats?
Were you sent here to seduce me out of my inventory?
No, Ruby, it's not like that.
And you came on to me.
Get out.
Sheila, we have a problem.
Yes, we do.
You need to get to Lisa's right now.
Anne is painting, and she is putting it all together Perspective, scale, depth Well, we have a problem here, too.
- Ah, better.
- Other side.
Ah, better.
I saw the infected clams.
Ruby's is the source.
Really interesting, honey.
And did you hear what I said?
Anne's got it all figured out.
Artistically.
You mean not artistically, but she's standing right next to you and we're fucked?
Yeah-huh.
I'll see you when you get here.
Damn it!
And I need to get gas.
Shit!
We discussed this, Marsha.
When we try to do too many things, everyone ends up disappointed.
All I'm saying, it's my sister's baby shower and I wanted to be there.
It's her third baby, Marsha.
A shower's tacky.
And I told you the day would come when I'd be called into service.
You also said you wanted a big family, and that day's not coming anytime soon.
Can we just not?
Can we please just not?
I'm sorry, I have a sacred purpose.
Wow, look what you did.
What did you do?
What did you do?
I was sitting at my easel thinking about all the people that have disappeared in Santa Clarita lately.
Then I just started painting the missing persons flyer for Dan.
Interesting.
Then I thought about Gary's finger that was found in Dan's cubby over there, - so I just painted that.
- Interesting.
I feel like there's another link between Gary and Dan that we just don't know yet.
But I couldn't figure it out, so I took a break and painted Joel.
So flattering.
Thank you.
- Hey, why me?
- Yeah, hey, why him?
I don't know.
I was painting suspicious objects and then I just thought of that nervous smile of yours.
- Yeah, that's the one.
- I'm not smiling.
Hey, what's this milkshake?
That's different and fun and different.
Oh, that's a tumbler full of vomit that was found in the apartment of a missing Serbian man who I think may have been murdered.
Wow, you're just seeing murder everywhere.
I'm starting to think that maybe Gary and Dan didn't really know each other at all.
And maybe someone planted Gary's finger to implicate Dan, and they're both really dead.
And the same person who killed them is also killing other people, like the missing Nazi and the Serb.
But who?
Who could be killing all of these people?
I gotta say, that theory seems crazy.
I don't wanna sound harsh, but you should burn these before people see them and judge you.
Yeah, my boss didn't buy it, either.
And that was harsh.
Well, still, maybe you should listen to your boss.
He is a boss for a reason.
I'm sorry if I sounded harsh, but I need you to understand.
- No one's gonna buy these.
- It's just that murder's such a downer.
Maybe paint something cute.
- I'd love to see your take on a baby.
- Or a lizard.
- Or a lizard baby.
- Nobody's painting lizard babies.
Mm-mm.
God damn it!
Anne's one Nazi-in-a-wheelchair painting away from nailing us.
Well, at least her boss doesn't believe her.
And what are we supposed to do with this?
I don't know.
I just thought it was a bad idea to have her staring at you while she's trying to solve our crimes.
Also, we don't have any paintings of you.
And if buying art isn't an effective way to shut Anne down?
What then?
- We can't kill her.
- I know.
- We only kill bad people.
- I know.
But what if she secretly is bad?
She seems nice, but it's always the people you least expect that do the worst things.
That's us.
You're describing us.
Yeah, it did sound familiar.
I like Anne.
She's my friend.
We're not killing her.
No, you're right.
That's off the table.
Can we blind her?
Is that something?
I don't wanna blind my friend.
Plus, that sounds even harder than killing her.
Yeah, it would require a lot of precision.
And we're not precise people.
I'm sorry, honey.
This whole thing is my fault.
No, it's not, sweetie.
It's not just Anne.
I screwed up, Joel.
I never told you this, but that night at Japopo's, I thought the clams smelled off.
But back then, I was too timid to complain.
It's not your fault.
- I shouldn't have eaten them.
- Please, honey, it's not you.
We shouldn't have even gone out that night.
- I was supposed to cook.
- You got stuck on a work call.
- We had to go out.
- Right.
A work call.
That's probably Rick.
I called him for help.
Oh, yeah.
Five thousand of these infected clams are being shipped out tomorrow.
So, if we don't do something, the world is gonna end.
Well, dang.
Problem solved.
Called in a favor with a friend of mine at the health department.
That's great!
I couldn't even get someone on the phone.
What'd he say?
Why do you assume it's a man?
Sexist.
I'm sorry.
What did she say?
It is a man, but you should question your assumptions.
That's the only way the world's ever gonna change.
I love that your police department made you take a sensitivity class, but I don't have time for this.
There's always time to respect the differences that make us great.
I got an A. Anyway, my friend will send someone next week - to help out with your clam problem.
- Next week?
That's not good enough, Rick.
I need this handled today.
Whoa, buddy.
Wha?
We've been friends a long time.
I know something's been going on with you lately.
Why don't you tell me what it is?
I discovered bad clams, and as a responsible citizen, I feel I must intervene.
Fine, don't tell me.
I'm sorry, Rick.
I'm trying to be a friend to you, Joel, but you keep pushing me away, and it's breaking my heart.
Fuck the sensitivity class.
It's turned me inside out.
Rick was no help, and I think we just broke up.
I'm sorry, honey.
What are we gonna do?
We've got Anne closing in on us and an army of undead clams about to wipe out civilization.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you, I think our gardener stole another hose.
God, it's just one thing after another.
Okay, right now, Anne's boss isn't taking her seriously.
But these clams go out tomorrow.
We need to destroy these ginger bitches tonight.
Right!
Why do you assume they're female?
I just I don't know.
I guess I need to work on that.
Sexist.
Oh, you heard my conversation with Rick.
Nice.
Okay, so to kill 30 tubs of clams in a hurry, I wanted to use something readily available.
First, I tried sending an electrical current through salt water, but our little friend just vibrated and then ejaculated something.
- Not trying to shame him.
- Perfectly natural, go on.
Then I put it in antifreeze, which would've killed one of these normal clams in seconds, but still no effect.
And now it is in bleach, which is strong enough to sterilize the urinals at Dodger Stadium and as I recently learned to get clam ejaculate out of a lab coat.
- What's cracking, clam assassins?
- The antifreeze didn't work and your mother can tell you about the electrical current.
Everything's riding on the bleach.
Look, it's opening up.
They do that when they're dying.
Definitely not dead.
Oh!
Holy shit!
-  - Oh!
He or she is eating him or her.
So, not bleach?
So, I'm thinking game over.
What does everyone wanna do for our last night on Earth?
I've never eaten a pomegranate.
I don't know, Eric.
They stain, so it's super dangerous.
Look, here's what I found in the Serbian book.
They burned Pozica to get rid of the virus.
Maybe fire could destroy these little dudes, too.
Why do you assume they're male, Abby?
Well, hot enough temperatures will incinerate anything, living or dead, male or female.
So why don't we just torch the whole clam farm?
Maybe because starting a big fire is reckless and dangerous, Abby.
Well, not if we work together and have each other's backs, Eric.
I can't help but notice you two are pointedly saying each other's names in a hurtful way.
Which we, damn it, don't have time to explore.
Right.
So no open flames.
It's brush fire season.
And I've already caused enough destruction in Santa Clarita without burning it down.
Ruby works nights.
We could go to her place, steal the clams, and then burn them somewhere where we can control.
- Like in our oven.
- A regular oven doesn't get hot enough.
To turn these to dust, it's gotta be above 1500 degrees.
There's a big kiln at Color Me Mine.
And I have a friend who works there.
Totally reliable.
Wouldn't flake at the last second.
You know, a friend.
You mean someone who doesn't pressure you to do things you don't wanna do?
Something is going on with these two.
Teenagers.
They even make the apocalypse about them.
Okay, clams, Sheriff Anne, their issues, confronting the gardener.
That feels like the right order of importance.
- I agree.
- We'll gather up the clams and meet you at the back of Color Me Mine.
We'll text you when we're on our way.
And if there's any problem with the kiln, let us know and we'll go to plan B. - Which is?
- We watch Eric eat a pomegranate.
Wow.
It's kind of beautiful.
I am unbelievably sweaty.
Yeah, well, Eric was just trying to protect you against contamination in case a clam bites you, or, God forbid, ejaculates on you.
World's worst porn.
- There are so many of them.
- We should get started.
We only have a few hours until Ruby gets home.
Also, I think I have an ant in here with me.
By the way, the friend of mine who works here, it's Sven.
Are you gonna be okay with that?
Obviously you didn't think I would be or you would've mentioned it on the drive over.
- But, yes, I'm okay with that.
- Okay, good.
'Cause in order to get what we want, I'm gonna flirt a little.
Whatever you have to do, do it.
I'll be fine.
- Okay.
- Hey, sorry, guys, we're closed.
Oh.
Hey, Abby.
- Hi, Sven.
- God damn it.
I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie together after you get off.
Yeah, sure.
Why is he here?
He's doing a super secret pottery project, and I would just consider it a huge favor if you could let him use your hot, hot kiln while you and I are share a lick-oriceand a Butt-erfinger.
Um, no, I can't leave him alone with the kiln.
What if he burns the entire place down?
I could be arrested, kiss college goodbye.
But kiss me hello.
Abby, I don't think it's working.
I apologize.
This is a new muscle for me.
Look, Sven, I was in your English class.
You're gonna be at this Color Me Mine the rest of your life unless someone writes your college essays for you.
Which I will do if you leave us the keys and walk away.
All right.
Text me when you're done.
Thanks for doing that.
- No problem.
- Listen.
I was a dick before.
You do a lot for me and I'm sorry I forgot that for a minute.
- It's okay.
- No.
I don't like a lot of people.
So I can't afford to be pissing off the ones I do like.
- So, are we good?
- Yeah.
Color Me "Fine".
That reminds me, please, please don't tell anyone about my flirting.
Don't worry.
I couldn't even describe it.
I deserve that.
Halfway through.
- You're such a good man.
-  You don't need to say that.
Seriously, you're the best husband an undead wife could ever ask for.
Putting up with Nazis, murder, suspicious cops.
And you lost your best friend today because I had to order the clams at Japopo's.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Look at how red these shells are.
I should've noticed.
They were drenched in marinara and the battery in our candle was dead.
I wanted the chicken marsala, but the waiter said, "We have one special left," and it felt exclusive, and I'm so stupid.
- Sheila.
- What?
It wasn't your fault.
It was mine.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm the reason you died.
That night we went to Japopo's, I was supposed to cook dinner.
- Right, but you had a work call.
- I lied.
You weren't home, I smoked a little pot, and instead of cooking, I watched "Epic Dog Fails" on YouTube.
Then I wanted pizza, so I told you I got stuck on a work call and we had to go out.
So all this happened because you got high and wanted to watch a stupid dog video?
Yes.
It's my fault.
Oh, my God.
Wait a minute.
- I sent you that video.
- You did?
So maybe this is my fault.
But Evelyn gave me that video from work, and her mom gave it to her.
You think this is Evelyn's mom's fault?
Maybe it's the dogs in that video who think they can make sharp turns on linoleum.
Maybe it's cavemen who decided to turn wolves into pets.
So you're saying it's everybody's fault?
But mostly cavemen?
No.
I'm saying it's nobody's fault.
Joel it's nobody's fault.
Thank you.
I'm coming for you, you clam-thieving motherfuckers.
Besides, maybe it's a good thing that it happened to us.
How is it good?
Because we're trying to stop it from spreading.
And maybe someone else wouldn't even care.
Right.
Maybe we are good people.
I'm gonna go with we are.
Not from where I'm standing.
Irving, you thieving son of a bitch.
Get out of my tubs.
Ruby, I can explain.
I'm bringing you more clams in these bags.
- Bullshit.
- Ruby, listen to me.
What Isaac is trying to say - Irving.
- Irving.
Oh, okay.
Well, you know what?
I didn't have anything anyway.
First, you waltz in here this morning trying to seduce me.
Then you send your two lackeys to interrogate me.
I was halfway to work before I realized my clams might be in danger.
Wait, did you say "lackeys"?
What lackeys?
We don't have any lackeys.
-  -  Oh!
What the fuck?
You missed.
Thank you, Marsha.
That's great feedback.
- What the hell happened?
- It's like a bomb went off.
Christ, I had no idea the seafood business was this competitive.
-  -  -  -   God Oh, my God.
No!
Okay, that's it.
I'm out, you win.
Please, just spare my house clams.
- We didn't do this.
- Yeah, we're good people.
- I think we should run.
- I agree.
Holy fuck, it worked.
You did it!
Now all we have to do is track down whoever ate those clams and kill them.
Totally.
What are you looking at?
You.
Let's go home and make a baby.
Don't say that if you don't mean it.
Don't look beautiful if you don't want me to love you.
-  Who the hell did that?
- I don't know, but they're serious.
No one casually owns a rocket launcher.
Do you think it was those lackeys Ruby was talking about?
Maybe.
Well, if they knew about the clams, how long until they find out about us?
This seems like a conversation we could have - while getting the fuck out of here!
- Right.
-  -  - Here.
- Thank you.
I texted Abby and told her we destroyed the clams.
- You said we destroyed the clams?
- Yeah.
I figured we could use a win.
We saved the world.
Almost.
Yeah, it's not our fault someone saved it first.
-  - It's Anne.
- Shit!
-  - Hi, Anne.
- Hi.
I just came over to say thank you.
You know, when you guys told me that my theory on the missing people was half-baked?
It was a little runny in the middle, yes.
Well, your skepticism made me dig deeper.
And I looked more into that missing Nazi, and it turns out that he dated, wait for it Gary's niece.
Whoa.
And two more Nazis have also gone missing.
Whoa.
Yeah.
It's all connecting.
I told my boss and he wants me to take it to Homicide.
- Homicide?
- Homicide.
Yeah, once those guys sink their teeth into something, there's no letting up.
So by next week, there could be a whole team of detectives working on this.
But but what about painting lizards?
Yeah.
- Where are the fucking lizards, Anne?
- Right here.
It's a baby one, like you wanted, as a thank-you.
If you hadn't warned me how weak my theory was, then I would've kept pushing it to my boss and I would've lost all credibility.
- You're welcome.
- Anyway, I gotta get going.
Lisa's baptism is tomorrow and I'm putting together a banging pray-list.
See you there!
- Homicide detectives!
- I know!
Remember an hour ago when someone shot a rocket at us?
- Yeah.
- What if those were the good times?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 That's it.
If homicide detectives start looking into our missing people, we're done.
Maybe we'll be okay.
The storage units are under fake names and we've started to kill outside of our friend circle.
You're defrosting an elbow in our microwave.
- We are terrible murderers!
-  Well, maybe they'll be terrible detectives.
We wouldn't survive a terrible cleaning woman.
So, what are you saying?
We should think about leaving before it's too late.
- Leaving?
Where would we go?
- I don't know.
We'd just keep going until we found someplace safe.
What about Abby?
She's still in school.
She can't live like a fugitive.
We could stop in Phoenix and drop her at your sister's.
Oh, my God.
You've really thought about this.
Since the day you killed Gary.
If we get caught, we'll never see each other again.
And if Abby's with us, she could end up in prison, too.
We don't have a lot of good choices.
No, but we do have Gary.
Right.
I guess we'd take him with us.
He's small and he knows a lot of jokes.
No, I'm saying that Anne's theory is that the same person killed Dan and Gary.
But if we can prove that Dan and Gary are alive, it destroys her case.
So what are you suggesting?
We walk into a sheriff's office, hold up Gary's head and say "Look, we're innocent.
We killed this guy, but he won't stay dead".
Of course not.
But sort of.
I want your opinion on my plan to blow up the trailer on the fracking site.
Really?
You said you didn't want my input 'cause I'm not doing it with you.
What was that animal you compared me to?
Was it a brave creature?
Oh, no, that's right, a mouse.
But we made up.
I'm not sure you specifically apolog - We made up.
- Thank you, I accept.
Also my pride has been replaced by how much I like my hands and how hard it would be to drive home if my arms ended at my wrists.
This is the explosive device I'm thinking of using.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Ooh!
Um Oh, okay.
Yeah, I mean, this'll probably work.
I'm thinking, with explosives, "this will probably work" isn't where I wanna be.
I mean, there are a couple of issues, but nothing you can't fix.
- When do you need it?
- Tonight.
Oh, my God, you're gonna die.
They're having a press rollout tomorrow talking about how great it is to fuck the Earth with their toxic semen, so their trailer needs to be a smoking hole in the ground by morning.
Wow, you will never work in corporate PR.
Okay.
Instead of transporting and assembling these volatile materials, it'd be safer to use what's already there.
The trailer has propane tanks.
Why not create a simple device to explode those?
Genius.
Is there anyone in this room who could build such a device?
There is one person.
Have I told that person how much I love him?
- No.
- As a friend?
Constantly.
Seriously, Eric, my hands thank you.
Ha!
Your hands.
That's cute.
You would've been blown so high into the stratosphere, you'd come down as rain in Europe.
So, using this burner phone, you'll record a message to Dan.
- Which is left on this burner phone.
- Neither of which are traceable.
And we'll plant that phone somewhere Anne will find it.
"What's this?
Why, it's a phone that must've belonged to Dan".
Curious, she'll listen to the voicemail.
"I'm a cop.
I wanna know everything.
It's so annoying".
She'll hear your message to Dan.
"Oh, my, Gary and Dan are still alive.
I should learn to leave well enough alone".
And her whole theory will implode.
Ba-boom!
Or since it's imploding, boom-ba!
So, what do you think?
- How's everyone's morning?
- What?
Just making conversation.
Excuse me for wanting human contact.
I was here yesterday.
I scratched your ears and we listened to Quadrophenia.
- For 15 minutes.
- I had to visit a clam farm so the world wouldn't end, and then get a rocket fired at me.
I didn't say you're not important, Mr. Big Shot.
Okay, my morning was great, Gary.
I went to the new Save 'n Save, bought two burner phones, these bracelets, and a pair of barbecue tongs, all for only $38.
I love that you're a smart shopper, and we did need new tongs.
But since our lives depend on it, I might not have bought - the cheapest phones on Earth.
- They're fine.
You're just upset 'cause you can't play Flappy Dunk on them.
So, we're thinking something like, "Hey, Dan, it's Gary.
I'm on my way to Mexico to find you".
"I have your laundered drug money.
And please don't send another Serbian goon to cut off a finger like you did before".
The Serbian thing connects another missing person we killed.
- But only if you can work it in.
- Try to work it in.
I'm just saying, if you load it up with too much exposition - It'll be better.
- Or it might not be believable.
- Try to work it in.
- Or don't.
Shall we?
Hey, Dan.
It's Gary.
I'm on my way to Mexico to meet with you.
But since I'm only a head, it may take me a few years to roll there.
-  - Delete.
Sorry, I'm just rarely the center of attention anymore.
Fine.
Let's do this.
Hey, Dan.
It's Gary.
How's the weather in Mexico?
And by "Mexico," I mean the inside Sheila's stomach.
- That's two.
- Delete.
Hey, Dan.
It's Gary.
I've laundered your money.
I'll meet you in Guadalajara on Thursday.
I'll be wearing a Padres cap and nothing else.
Oh, the shark, babe Has such teeth, dear I heard Joel killed you with a shovel and then Sheila ate you.
With her teeth, dear.
And she shows them So, I will see you in Guadalajara with the money next week.
We did it, buddy.
We're rich.
- Perfect.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now, I want you guys to do something for me.
- Why do your ears get so itchy?
- No, it's not that.
I want you to kill me.
- What?
- My niece and Hailey are safe.
I don't have a purpose anymore.
I don't wanna sit in a vase forever, guys.
That's no life.
But we just started rewatching The Wire.
Joel I'm ready to die.
I know you've gotten to be friends with him, honey, but if Gary wants to die, or be deader, I think we need to help him.
I know, but I just started to like having him around.
It's like taking in a stray dog.
Housebreaking him, letting him sleep on your bed Then one day you're playing fetch and he comes back with a gun and asks you to shoot him.
Abby's on her way.
Listen, if this phone thing doesn't work and we get caught, I think I should take the fall.
- Joel.
- We'll say I'm a serial killer who's cannibal-curious, and you had no idea.
People are surprised by their spouses all the time.
Judy Plumpton just found out that Bob doesn't like any form of chickpeas, and they've been married 20 years.
How crazy is that?
- Honey - That way, you can stay with Abby.
And I'd be fine in prison.
I make friends super easy and I love bunk beds.
You're also a picky eater and you don't like people touching your stuff.
Plus, there's no guarantee you'll get the top bunk.
Hey, guys, what's up?
We know you've been working really hard on a school project, so we decided to make you some lunch.
Lunch.
Oh, boy!
Sensing an agenda, but whatever.
Alphabet soup?
Oh, boy!
And I mean it.
I haven't even done anything and it already says "fart".
Like it knows who's eating it.
So, are you guys coming to my mom's baptism later?
Prepare yourselves.
Anne invited a ton of her friends, so it's gonna be wall-to-wall cops.
- They forgot.
- We didn't forget.
But I am wondering, how important is it that we go?
Not at all?
I agree.
I think it's gonna be suspicious if we don't go.
Besides, Anne may be the instrument of our doom, but she's still my friend and this baptism is important to her.
The gal does love her some God.
Yeah, she sees His work in everything we do.
I know that because she crocheted me a pillow that says, "I see His work in everything we do".
It must be nice to have the comfort and clarity of religion.
The only things I believe in enough to put on a pillow are "I'm winging it" and "All races taste the same".
Oh, Anne also invited the head of the homicide unit, Bill Ramirez.
I met him once.
Super intimidating.
I confessed to stealing Milk Duds when I was seven, which I didn't even do.
So, there's that, too.
Bill Ramirez, honey.
There's that, too.
I know, sweetheart, but we still have to go.
Fine.
Then we're gonna need your help with something.
- So this lunch was a bribe?
- No.
We just feel guilty because we're gonna ask you to do something that's potentially dangerous.
And we wanted to give you a treat to incentivize you to go Oh, it is a bribe.
Wow, I can't believe your family's survival comes down to us.
My parents can't sneak around your house trying to hide a phone.
What if they got caught?
Which you know they would because they're not good at anything.
Apart from being realtors.
And they don't even pronounce that right.
It's just when it comes to being clandestine, spelling dirty words in alphabet soup is kind of the edge of my comfort zone.
- Are my mom and Anne still in the yard?
- Yeah, still putting out chairs.
Okay.
All right, I got one of Dan's flak jackets.
I'm placing the phone in the pocket, but not so deep that Anne won't hear it when we call and Huh.
What?
This is C4.
That's a military-grade explosive.
Why would Dan have this?
Because he was reckless and stupid.
- Let's take it.
I can use it tonight.
- Wait, what?
No.
Abby, you shouldn't go tonight, anyway.
There's way too much happening.
Just give it a few days, see if things settle down.
Things are never going to settle down.
You don't know that.
Eric, it might not be now, but one day, they're going to come for my mom.
And when that happens, our lives are over.
So before this ends, I wanna know that I was here, that I existed.
I need to make a mark.
- By destroying something?
- By saving something.
And I don't have time to wait for someone else to do it.
I really admire your commitment and steely resolve, but I wish you didn't have any of it.
Someone's coming.
Hey.
- You see, 'cause it's blue - And green.
And green.
That's how you know.
- Eric, Abby.
- Hi.
What are you guys doing?
Eric has something he wants to say to you on this, the holy day of Lisa's baptism.
Eric?
Today is my mother's baptism.
It'll be sunny and warm, high in the mid-90s.
Ha!
He's so shy.
I'll start him off.
He just wants to say how much he appreciates everything you've done for Lisa and how happy he is that you're in their lives.
- Okay, buddy?
- Okay.
The rest is up to you.
- I mean, she pretty much said it.
- Thank you, Eric.
That's sweet.
I love your mother, and I think you're pretty great, too.
Oh, well Well, I'm just gonna grab some sunscreen.
Wait!
Would it be weird if I called you "Mother"?
No, that is weird and not at all necessary, but thank you.
-  - What the hell is that?
Sounds like it's coming from the closet.
- Dan's closet?
-  What?
That's impossible.
-  -  Wow.
That's a lot of cops.
It's going to be okay, honey.
Abby said Anne found the phone.
We don't know if she heard Gary's message, or if she ever will.
Listen, if things go south, we should have a panic word.
A panic word?
Yeah.
Something that if one of us says, the other will know there's trouble and we have to go.
A word we wouldn't ordinarily use, like halibut.
- Halibut?
- It doesn't have to be halibut.
I vote it's not.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We, mostly you, just need to be calm.
- Look at how relaxed everyone is.
- Maybe none of them are murderers.
That would free up a lot of mental bandwidth.
Or maybe they're just all religious like Anne.
She's never stressed out.
Maybe we should join a church.
It could be good for us.
Maybe.
It would be nice to give the weekend some structure.
But right now, let's just get through this and avoid that Bill Ramirez guy.
- I know.
Which one do you think he is?
- Hello.
Bill Ramirez.
Bill Ramirez!
- Honey!
- I'm seeing him.
I can tell by how you comport yourselves that you're the only people here not in law enforcement.
You got us.
We're the Hammonds.
- This is my Joel husband.
- Dah!
- She means, Joel, husband.
- Husband, Joel.
There it is.
And this is my wife, Joel.
Wow.
Sheila.
My wife, Sheila.
And you're right, we're not in law enforcement.
We're "realators".
So, Hammonds, you guys knew Dan, right?
We sure did.
He lived right next door.
I thought he lived here.
Uh, next door to us, which is next door.
To him.
- Where he lived.
- Which is here.
- Not there.
- Where we are.
- Although, not now.
- No.
Now we're over here.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm gonna go put this down.
It was so nice to meet you.
Yes.
Jesus Christ, we just spent ten minutes explaining the concept of "next door".
What happened to you?
I'm the one that's shitty at this.
I got nervous.
He's a homicide detective and we're homicide enthusiasts.
It's not a good match.
Hey.
- We don't have to leave town.
- Wait, what?
Anne heard the message from Gary.
She was totally bummed, said her whole case collapsed.
She's canceling her meeting with Bill Ramirez next week.
- Oh, my God.
- We did it!
We, mostly you, are fucking masterminds.
Unbelievable.
Something you guys planned actually worked.
If this happens a thousand more times, I may have to rethink my perception of you.
I love it when you almost respect us.
I'm getting a drink.
You need anything?
Just to revel in my fucking glory.
- Hey, guys.
- Hiya.
Hey, Sheila.
You look beautiful.
I love those bracelets.
I can never wear anything like that.
The Lord gave me these giant wrists.
What are you talking about?
Your wrists are lovely.
When Anne was a little girl, her father told her she had man-wrists.
Totally fucked her up.
Men are capable of such specific abuse.
Anne, everything about you is beautiful, inside and out.
And that goes for all of you.
You are awesome, strong, loving women, and I am so grateful that we are all gonna get to be friends for the rest of our lives.
- That's so sweet.
- Hello, ladies.
How's everyone's day?
Oh, great now.
It was pretty sucky earlier.
Really?
That's terrible.
I'm sorry that happened, whatever it was.
Anne found an old phone of Dan's.
There was a message on it from Gary, who's still alive.
- Get out!
- Holy cow!
Right?
And Dan's in Mexico.
Probably getting his dick fixed.
That man was all kinds of crooked.
Anyway, because of that voicemail, Anne's entire theory imploded.
Boom-ba!
Because it's an implosion.
I'm sorry, Anne.
But the important thing is is you tried.
And now you can stop trying.
At least I found more evidence that Dan was a dirty cop.
I sent the phone to our tech guy to see what else he could get off of it.
Texts, deleted voice messages, emails - Hang on.
- Yeah, hang on.
Did you say deleted voice messages?
Because they're deleted, which means they're gone, so why are we even talking about it?
Goodbye.
End of story.
Actually, most people don't know this, but phone companies store deleted voice messages for a few days in case a customer wants to retrieve one or law enforcement wants to listen.
- I did not know that.
-  I didn't either.
Me neither.
So, did your bisexuality sneak up on you or did it burn inside you for a long time?
Who cares?
What is it with you and missing people, anyway?
It's like you're obsessed.
Well, solving crime is my calling, Joel.
I believe I serve God by bringing evildoers to justice.
Halibut.
I want halibut.
I'm going to the food table to see if there's halibut.
Sometimes he craves really good whitefish.
Everyone says it's okay.
We are not acting normal, mostly you.
Everything is on those deleted messages.
Everything!
That I killed Dan, that you ate Gary Well, we just have to figure out a way to erase them.
We can't erase them.
- There must be something we can do.
- Sheila.
- Someone that can help.
- Sheila!
There's nothing we can do.
They're going to find them, maybe even today, and arrest us.
We have to get out now!
I can't.
This is our home.
Honey, it's over.
Go home and start packing.
I'll go to the storage unit and get enough food to go on the road.
We'll leave in an hour.
- What about Gary?
- I'll get him, too.
And if he still wants to die, then we can do it on our way out of town.
I'll call my sister and tell her that we're bringing Abby.
We'll be okay, honey.
And when we get settled, we'll send for her.
We'll be a family again.
I know.
And let's not tell her about your sister until we're on the road.
Yeah.
Abby's gonna have an opinion about that.
Opinion about what?
Oh, God.
What's going on?
The phone thing didn't work.
It made it worse.
Oh, no.
- My family's leaving.
- Leaving?
- When?
- In an hour.
- Jesus.
- Eric, listen.
We're gonna keep knowing each other, okay?
We're just taking a break.
- I wanna go with you.
- You can't.
You know that.
I have to go.
Okay.
Should we kiss?
I feel like if we kiss, I'll never see you again.
Yeah.
Let's kiss anyway.
Well, we did that.
Yes, we did.
What?
I'm gonna blow that fracking trailer up tonight.
- My tribute to you.
- Oh, cool.
Thanks.
You mean, "Eric, you don't have to do that".
- No, it's great.
- Abby, I'm doing it.
Mm-hmm.
Gary's in a bowling ball bag in the car, so, glad we're finally using that.
Abby's pulling camping stuff out of the garage.
- How's it going in here?
- Good.
Your stuff's in that bag.
You packed me, like, all my lingerie.
No shoes or pants?
Did I?
I'm panicking, so my lizard brain is making a lot of the decisions.
Listen, we may not have time to discuss this again.
If we get caught Honey, I'm the one responsible for this, so I It has to be me.
Do you understand?
If they find out what you are, you won't even get to prison.
So, please, I need you to promise, if it comes to it, you'll let me take the blame.
I promise.
Okay, good.
So, socks.
- Three pairs or all of 'em?
- Aunt Kathy called.
She said something about getting a room ready for me.
- Right.
We were gonna tell you.
- Yeah, we're not doing that.
We don't even know where we're going.
We might be living on the road.
Hey, we're a family.
If you fuckers try to leave me somewhere, I will track you down and give you so much shit, it'll make the time you didn't take me to see One Direction feel like a walk in the goddamn park.
I told you she'd have an opinion.
All right.
Go pack.
Please.
I've had my go-bag ready since you killed Gary.
By the way, you're taking too much stuff.
Also, you should go to the bank and withdraw as much cash as you can before they freeze your accounts.
What were we thinking?
We're so gonna need her.
I agree with Abby.
It feels like too much stuff.
- Thank you.
-  Yeah.
And why are we bringing the toaster oven?
- We just bought it.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
You going on a trip?
No, no.
We're just donating a bunch of things to Goodwill.
We were so inspired by Lisa's baptism.
It was beautiful.
I didn't see you guys after.
- We ran home to give our things away.
- That's right.
It all connects.
All our ducks, right in a row.
Well, I just wanted to come over and thank you for what you said about always being friends.
I was feeling pretty bummed about my case falling apart, and you reminded me what's really important.
Well, I'm so glad.
I really meant it.
I'm just really thankful that God brought you into my life.
I am, too, Anne.
Here.
I want you to have these.
For your beautiful wrists.
Wow, thank you so much, Sheila.
Hey, you know, as long you're giving stuff away, could I have this guitar?
My guitar?
I've always wanted to learn how to play.
- Okay.
- Great, thanks.
Oh, are these men's clothes?
My brother would love this stuff.
He's been a little down on his luck lately.
- Okay.
- Great.
Thanks.
-  - Oh.
Oh, it's my tech guy.
Hey, Steve.
What'd you find on Dan's phone?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Are you sure about that?
Okay.
Thanks.
- Well, it's all over, guys.
- I'm gonna throw up.
They couldn't find anything.
Did you just say you were gonna throw up?
It can wait.
Go on.
Well, it turns out Dan was using a super cheap burner phone and the company doesn't keep deleted voice mails.
-  Really?
-  Wow!
Dan is a pretty brilliant criminal, buying the cheapest phone he could find.
God, I love him.
I mean the same way I love Hitler or Stalin.
They were all babies once.
Okay.
Hey, maybe I'll snag this toaster oven, too.
Lisa could use a new one.
Could you just stuff your clothes under my arm here?
I'm running out of hands.
Thank you.
All right, I'll see you guys.
- So we're staying?
- Yeah.
We're safe.
She took all my stuff.
- Yeah, we're lucky she's not a bowler.
-  Speaking of which, I'd love to get out of this bag and stretch my face.
You got it, buddy.
Let's run back to the storage unit.
We can try soaking your neck in whiskey like you wanted, see if you get a buzz.
Actually, Joel, I still want you to kill me tonight.
- Abby.
- We're not leaving.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You guys are getting our toaster oven.
- Okay.
So, I can do this tonight.
You don't have to anymore.
It'll be safer if I go with you.
I lost you once today.
I don't wanna lose you again.
Okay.
We'll leave as soon as it gets dark.
Yes, I'm sure.
You think this is enough C4?
That on a propane tank?
It'll light up the sky from here to Fresno.
Great.
Let's take more.
- So you wanna talk about the kiss?
- I don't think so.
Cool.
Don't need to.
When I first met Gary West, I was not a fan.
Oh, the feeling was mutual, my friend.
But now, though he's only ten inches tall, I look up to him.
Son of a I'll never forget the night we thought Sheila killed Carl.
I found myself in the storage unit with Gary.
I was pretty upset until he shared this story about the time he saw Paul Shaffer at a car wash holding this super tiny cat that somehow Gary, knucklehead, thought was a woman's glove.
Its legs looked like furry little fingers.
Why would he be cradling a woman's glove?
I thought he was sad because he lost the other one.
- It makes no sense!
- Classic Gary.
So funny.
We could go on all night, and almost have.
- Right.
- Ah.
Gary, you've been someone I can talk to, someone who listens, who has opinions, especially when it comes to baseball.
- Ugh, fucking Padres.
- Who roots for the Padres?
- I'm from San Diego!
- Maybe I'll come back and pick you up.
No, no, no, let's do it.
Come on, right now, quick and clean.
Yeah.
We got this a couple weeks ago when we thought we needed it for me.
It's pretty, isn't it?
We thought you might enjoy being shot with it through a silk pillow.
Oh!
You guys are the best.
I mean, sure, you disemboweled me and buried me alive, but after that you really stepped up.
I'm gonna miss you both.
Bye, Gary.
Aw.
- Bye, buddy.
- Goodbye, Gary.
I can't.
You worried about killing half the world's Padres fans?
Can you do it?
One, two Cha-cha-cha.
You're right.
It's too hard.
It feels wrong.
- Someone's coming!
- Oh!
Hide the head!
Hide the fucking head!
- I have a name.
- Shit!
If you're gonna bury someone out here, you should turn your cell phones off so they can't be tracked.
What?
That's crazy.
I don't know what you're talking about, even a little.
I realized I heard that sound somewhere.
-  -  We did it, buddy.
We're rich.
It was on Gary's voice message.
You guys were there when he recorded it.
It all makes sense now.
Why Joel's always nervous around me, your obsession with my case, even why you were loading up your car today.
You guys killed Dan.
Why else would you try so hard to make me think he was alive?
You're both murderers.
No.
Not both of us.
- Just - Me.
- What are you doing?
- If I go away, Abby lives with you, and she has a chance at a normal life.
If you're gone, she'll never have that.
But you promised.
It was gonna be me.
Joel.
It was always gonna be me.
No.
We're leaving, Anne.
And if you happen to have my guitar, I'll take that, too.
You're never getting that guitar.
And you're also not leaving.
Guys, come on.
Put the guns down!
Your lady weapon is only good from about five feet away, Joel.
- Then I'll move closer.
- Then I'll shoot you.
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- I will shoot you.
I don't know her that well.
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- I will shoot you.
- You're not gonna shoot - Oh, my God, new plan!
Okay, you shot me.
It's your training.
I'm not mad.
How how?
What?
Anne, I'm gonna tell you the truth.
Then I'm hoping you're gonna let us go.
- I can't let you go.
- I died and then I came back to life.
And now I hunt people to survive.
But only bad people.
In a way, it's like what you do, only we're volunteers.
- That's impossible.
- You just shot her.
- You can shoot her again if you want.
- Yeah, you can totally shoot Whoa.
Anne does not have a problem shooting people.
So you've risen from the dead?
And and you're doing God's work by ridding the world of evildoers?
Is that what you're saying?
- It's not not what we're saying.
- That that can't be true.
- This is a trick.
-  A trick?
Then how do you explain this?
Behold!
Hi.
Gary West.
- She can grant eternal life!
- Eternal!
Oh, Lord!
Help me.
Is it true?
Have You chosen Sheila to do Your work?
Unlikely, but seems to be true.
Help me understand, Lord.
If this is Your doing, show me a sign.
Praise be.
You are His instrument.
This makes me a little uncomfortable.
You did say you wanted to get more into religion.
I know, but I didn't wanna start one.
How may I serve you?
Well, this just got fucking weird.
