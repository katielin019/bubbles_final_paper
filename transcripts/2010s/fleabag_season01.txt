{START OF EPISODE 1}
1  You know that feeling when a guy you like sends you a text at two o'clock on a Tuesday night asking if he can come and find you, and you've accidentally made it out like you've just got in yourself, so you have to get out of bed, drink wine, get in the shower, shave everything, dig out some Agent Provocateur business - suspender belt, the whole bit - and wait by the door until the buzzer goes?
And then you open the door to him, like you've almost forgotten he's coming over.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
And then you get to it immediately.
After some pretty standard bouncing, you realise he's edging towards your arsehole.
But you're drunk and he made the effort to come all the way here, so you let him.
He's thrilled.
I'm so thrilled.
And then the next morning, you wake to find him fully dressed, sat on the side of the bed, gazing at you.
- He says that - Last night was incredible.
Which you think is an overstatement, but then he goes on to say that It was particularly special because I've never managed to actually up the bum with anyone before.
To be fair, he does have a large penis.
And although it's always been a fantasy of mine, I've never found anyone I could do it with.
And then he touches your hair and thanks you with a genuine, earnest Thank you.
It's sort of moving.
Then he kisses you gently.
And then he leaves.
And you spend the rest of the day wondering Do I have a massive arsehole?
Wow!
Er this doesn't happen very often, does it?
No.
I su I suppose it's It's quite rare, yeah.
I hate myself.
Er, are you going to work?
- Oh, no, actually - OK, er, this is going to sound crazy but I think that I should take your number and I think I should call it, and I think I should ask you if you want to go out for a drink with me.
Er Fuck me!
You've got a boyfriend?
Er, no, er No, we broke up quite recently, actually.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry/really pleased.
Er How the hell did he manage to fuck that up?
'Power rarely gives up without a fight '..
particularly in places where there are divisions of tribe, 'divisions of sect.
'We also know that populism can take dangerous turns.
'And there will be difficult days along the way.
'From the extremism of those who would use democracy 'to deny minority rights to the nationalism that left' - What are you doing?
- Nothing!
Harry!
- I know what you were doing.
- I was watching the news.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
What was he talking about, then?
- What?
- Please, I just need to hear this.
What was he talking about?
Iraq.
Don't say anything.
And please don't stop me leaving.
- Please don't!
- OK.
Don't!
Look, I've really tried to be there for you through this.
You can't say I haven't tried.
Don't say anything.
And please don't contact me or turn up at my house drunk in your underwear.
It won't work this time.
It will.
I'm taking that posh shampoo.
He was talking about democ Oh, he was just really kind and supportive with my work.
He'd cook all the time, run baths, hoover.
He'd laugh at all of my jokes.
He was really great with my family, my friends loved him.
Plus, he was really fucking affectionate.
- Sounds like a dickhead.
- Yeah.
So, was that, like, "You CAN have my number," or?
What are we?
Yes.
Yeah, I guess that's a yes.
Oh, my gosh.
Great.
Er OK.
Put that in there.
And I'll be sure to treat you like a nasty little bitch.
- Er, that was a joke.
- Oh, no, I know.
- I know!
- OK.
I was, like, "Oh"!
OK.
Great, wow!
Er I'll buzz you, then?
- OK.
- OK.
OK.
I can't stop smiling.
Sorry, I It's OK.
I'll go.
Thank you for coming in today.
We really appreciate you considering us for your small business start-up loan.
No problem.
I've read your application form.
- Thank you.
- It was - funny.
- Oh.
OK, that wasn't my intention, but As you are probably aware, we haven't had the opportunity to support many - any - women-led businesses since the Sexual harassment case.
The sexual harassment case.
Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
I just, er I ran from the station, so I'm just a bit hot.
- I'm really excited about - Water?
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Actually, yeah, water would be great.
If I could Sure.
There are a couple of details that we need to iron out, and one or two bits and pieces I'm going to need to see some more on.
It says in here that you opened a business with your partner OK.
I'm sorry, that kind of thing won't get you very far here any more.
Oh, no, sorry.
I thought I had a top on underneath.
- Yeah, OK.
- No, seriously.
In this case, genuine accident.
I can see, given our history, why you might think No!
Seriously, I wasn't trying to.
I was hot.
I take this kind of thing very seriously.
I'm not trying to shag you!
Look at yourself!
OK.
Please leave.
Oh No, you don't understand.
I NEED this - I need this loan.
- Please, just leave.
- Perv.
- Slut.
Wow!
'The lecture will commence shortly.
' My sister.
She's uptight and beautiful and probably anorexic, but clothes look awesome on her, so You're almost late.
Had to do a flash poo in Pret.
Oh, Christ.
Did you wash your hands?
Of course not.
Oh, my God!
You are disgusting!
Fucking hell.
Of course I washed my hands.
It's not like I grew up without a mother.
- Heard from Dad?
- No.
Dad's way of coping with two motherless daughters was to buy us tickets to feminist lectures, start fucking our godmother and eventually stop calling.
- You look tired.
- Thanks.
I've been sleeping really well recently.
Shit!
I'm wearing the top that she "lost" years ago, so this is going to be tense.
- Do you want to take your coat off?
- No.
OK.
Oh, sorry.
Thanks.
So, any luck - God, can we just have two seconds - I was going to ask - about the cafe.
- I don't want to talk about it yet.
- We won't talk, then.
- Fine.
- Hair looks nice.
- Oh, fuck off.
The only thing harder than having to tell your super-high-powered, perfect, anorexic, rich super-sister that you've run out of money is having to ask her to bail you out.
I'm just going to ask her.
I'm just going to ask her.
I'm just going to ask her.
I'm just going to come - Do you need to borrow money?
- No!
I can't do it.
I can't do it, I can't do it.
I can't do it.
- So business is good, then?
- Yeah.
It's good.
It's really good.
It's really, really good.
Yeah, it's really good.
Sounds like it's really good.
It is.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks, I'm good.
Are you sure I can't get you anything at all?
Is Harry helping?
We broke up.
What?
Again?
!
If you see him, I'm a wreck, OK?
God!
Just don't get drunk and scream through his letterbox again.
Wow!
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Don't get drunk and shit in your sink again.
When are you going to stop bringing that up?
When you do something better.
I have two degrees, a husband and a Burberry coat.
You shat in a sink.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
Nothing is ever going to be better.
I swear there are pants that give you thrush.
What are yours made from?
Don't know.
I need to get sexy pants.
I hate my body, I hate my body, I hate my body, I hate my body.
Fucking last-minute bastard trendy parties.
Why do we do it to ourselves?
Oh, my God.
Definitely not.
That does nothing for you.
I hate that.
What?
These are MY clothes, Boo.
I've been wearing these all day.
Oh, God.
Were you wearing your coat?
Yes.
But Nothing here looked nice, so I thought I'd wear what I was wearing anyway.
Are you joking?
Are YOU joking?
Yes.
- Oh, my - It's not really that bad at all.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I love you.
- I'll buy - I've got to get a whole new outfit now.
I'll buy you pants.
- I'll buy you sexy pants.
- I've been so many places today!
- I'll buy you sexy pants!
- Fuck off.
I'm sorry.
I think it's a lovely dress.
Ugh!
I mean, you really shouldn't wear such cheap materials.
They don't let your fanny breathe.
I know.
Gosh, look at you all.
Thank you so much for coming to Women Speak, opening women's mouths since 1998.
Before we begin, I would like to ask you a question.
I don't know about you but I need some reassurance.
So I pose the question to the women in this room today.
Please raise your hands if you would trade five years of your life for the so-called perfect body.
- I want my top back.
- OK.
- Won't you get cold?
- Nah, I've got really hairy nipples.
What?
- Fuck!
- Oh, fuck!
What was that?
- Jesus!
- A fucking hug!
Well, why the fuck did you do that?
That's terrifying.
Never do that again.
I was just trying to - Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Do you want to go for a drink, or?
- I've got plans.
- OK, fine.
Sure.
See you next time, Women Speak, then.
Do you want to go for a drink?
My sister blows glass.
She has done for a long time.
I've never been in a fight.
Well, I've been in a fight.
Never been punched in the face.
I've been punched in the leg.
And someone once threw some punch in my face.
So, my colours this season are sort of brown, mainly.
But, like, you know, I wouldn't say no to a maroon.
I wouldn't, like, jump down the throat of someone wearing something blue.
It's just not for me.
So I'm going to go for a wazz.
You OK.
Same again, while I'm up?
Or perhaps, like, a little cocky-tail?
Or, like, a nice shot?
Oh, er yeah, or we could just go back to mine.
Wow!
Er, thanks.
Er, I've actually got work tomorrow, but, er, another drink here - Or we could go back to yours.
- Got to be up really early.
- I'll get you a cab in the morning.
- That's ridiculous!
My God!
OK, what the fuck is your problem?
Oh, er nothing.
I, er I-I like you.
OK, you're a dick.
What's going on?
You're pathetic.
- Wait - Don't follow me.
I-I wasn't.
Y-You dropped this.
Er OK.

OK.
Yeah, OK.
I'm I don't want to I'm going to It was Oh, fuck it.
I have a horrible feeling that I'm a greedy, perverted, selfish, apathetic, cynical, depraved, morally bankrupt woman, who can't even call herself a feminist.
Well, er You get all that from your mother.
Good one.
Er, I'm going to call you a cab, darling.
And, er please don't go upstairs.
To be fair, she's not an evil stepmother.
She's just a cunt.
Hi.
Darling, I thought that must be you.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, I just thought I'd swing by.
Oh, how lovely.
Lucky us.
Don't worry - Dad's already booking me a taxi.
What are you doing?
Oh, painting.
I find the night-times very peaceful.
Usually.
Oh, warming up.
Look, I know it's not really my place, but are you OK?
- Everyone's been really worried.
- Poor fucker.
Yes, she's actually an expression of how women are subtle warriors.
Strong at heart.
We don't have to use muscular force to get what we want.
- We just use our - Tits.
innate femininity.
Tits don't get you anywhere these days.
Trust me.
It's very valuable, actually.

- Thousands.
Oh.

No.

Oh, er my self-portrait.

Oh, no, that's good.
It'll keep me going.
Shoot.
- I opened the cafe with my friend Boo.
- Cute name.
- Yeah.
Yeah, she's dead now.
She accidentally killed herself.
Wasn't her intention, but it wasn't a total accident.
She didn't actually think she'd die.
She just found out that her boyfriend fucked someone else and wanted to punish him by ending up in hospital, not letting him visit her for a bit.
She decided to walk into a busy cycle lane, wanting to get tangled in a bike - break a finger, maybe.
As it turns out, bikes go fast and flip you into the road.
Three people died.
She was such a dick.
So, yeah.
Kind of on my own.

He also used to say things like You're not like other girls.
You can keep up.
I like Harry.
I liked his songs.
I admire how much Harry commits to our break-ups.
I mean, this is a new detail, but he does usually go the extra mile.
A few times, he's even cleaned the whole flat.
Like it's a crime scene.
I've considered timing a break-up for when the flat needs a bit of a going over.
I don't think this is working.
What?
But he always leaves him to come back for.
Got to think about all the people I can have sex with now.
I'm not obsessed with sex, I just can't stop thinking about it.
The performance of it.
The awkwardness of it.
The drama of it.
The moment you realise someone wants your body.
Not so much the feeling of it.
Probably got about 48 hours before Harry comes back.
I should get on it.

I can organise it and act surprised but, if you could just, erm Do you know what, why don't I just do it?
I can organise it, do the food, act surprised, and just take it off your hands.

Fine, thanks.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were going to react like that.
I'm I'm sorry, it was a joke.
It was a good joke.
Jesus.
I thought you'd be later.
- Argh!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, God, sorry!
I just had to get that out!
I'm still in shock!
I'm still shaking!
That was horrible.
It was a surprise.
I know.
Thank you.
It's fine.
Shall I go and get us some wine?
OK.
I know what you look like!
I know what you took!
That is the last time!
Splashed out on a special bottle for a special Harry?
I had to go into the history on my computer to find something I'd seen on the H&M website this morning and I don't want to point fingers but anal, gang bang, mature, big cock, small tits, hentai, Asian, teen, MILF, big butts, lesbian, gay, facial, fetish, bukake, young and old, swallow, rough, voyeur and public.
Why are you being so sexy?
Don't make me hate you.
Loving you's painful enough.
OK, sorry but I really think you should write that down.
I know it's not appropriate but I really think you should write that down.
It's really good - I'm not going to write down - No, I'm serious!
For your songs and stuff.
It's perfect!
It's poetic yet real.
Serious.
Don't make me - Hate you.
- Yeah, I know, thank you.
Loving you is painful What am I doing?
Look, there's someone at work who loves me.
Well, she told me she loves me and I said we couldn't be together because I had to know.
Do you want to be alone?
You will never see me again.
I'll always love you but I just can't take it any more.
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.
He's going to write that down.
Don't hate you Scared I'm going to go pack my things up from the bedroom again, but, erm I'm I'm not going to clean.
It's still in pretty good shape, so If I don't see you after that, goodbye.
Forever.
He'll be back.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 What a pair, where did you get this?
Can I have it?
No.
Did you take the sculpture?
No.
If I sell it I take 10%, deal?
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need I don't need money.
That'll be Â£25, please.
I thought we should try and surprise each other once every day.
He's organising you a surprise birthday party.
You know I hate Surprise!
It's me, it's me.
I suppose you should meet Hillary.
You will never see me again.
I've got to think about all the people I can have sex with now.
I should get on it.
Jogging.
I did a fart the other day that was exactly like Mum's.
A door opening, or suspicious dark?
Door opening.
Means you're getting Mum's bum.
God, I'd be lucky.
My bottom dropped ages ago.
My farts used to be like, "Pah"!
Now they're just sort of fighting their way out.
I haven't farted in about three years.
Happy birthday.
- She won't eat it.
- Thanks.
So, it's a 7 pm arrival tonight for a 7.30 surprise, OK?
Yeah, I got your e-mail.
It's really a business birthday thing.
It won't be much fun, so just don't expect a "party" party.
I won't.
And maybe just wear trousers.
And don't drink too much.
There's this huge promotion in Finland, so this party is quite a serious I mean, it's basically a business meeting.
Sounds like a blast.
Can I bring a date?
- Harry?
- No.
Who?
Oh, I don't know yet.
It's really inappropriate to jog around a graveyard.
Why?
Flaunting your life.
God, I can't wait to be old.
If it's any consolation, you look older than you are.
Sorry, sorry.
- Hello, Claire speaking.
- Mum died three years ago.
She had a double mastectomy but never really recovered.
It was particularly hard, cos she had amazing boobs.
She used to tell me I was lucky cos mine would never get in the way.
My sister's got whoppers, but she got all of Mum's good bits.
What's Martin given you?
A cursory stroke would be nice.
What?
No bang-bang?
He says he's still got that thing on his What?
On his Come on, you can do it.
- I don't have to say - Yes, you do.
- No, not here.
- Come on, little one.
Come on, please.
- No.
- Penis.
- Thank you.
He says he still has that thing on his penis.
Sorry.
Christ, look at that man.
Tragic.
Nah, he's a con.
You can't call someone who is grieving a con.
- That is shit grieving.
- Look at him, he's properly grieving.
No-one grieves like that unless they are in a film or from Italy.
Who are you to pass judgment on his grief?
Trust me, he's at a different grave every day, he can't get enough of it.
What?
You come here every day?
Don't do a jumpy-outy surprise thing, and don't sing Happy Birthday, I couldn't bear it.
I'm, erm I'm actually looking forward to it.
Hi, Harry, it's me.
Listen, I know we're broken up, but it's Claire's birthday tonight and I thought that I thought that maybe you'd like to come to her birthday party.
Anyway, give me a call, and I hope you're OK.
Bye.
I can't go out with a dog.
My boyfriend before Harry used to make me send him pictures of my vagina wherever I was, ten or 11 times a day.
One day when I was temping he asked me to Time to throw the net out.
I am in so much trouble.
Jesus Christ.
What am I going to get Claire?
I am meant to get her the perfect present.
- I am not drunk.
- Always drunk.
I am not drunk!
Which is odd, cos Claire's so straight.
Smack me in the face.
- Really hard.
- Really?
Yeah.
Oh, good.
Fuck.
I think you gave me a semi.
Can I eat a water or a sandwich, or something?
I mean, the man's got a problem.
Speak to me.
Speak to me.
But no-one wants to admit there's a problem because then they don't get to have crazy nights out with Fun Drunk Martin.
Chicken, are you chicken?
No.
He's one of those men who is explosively sexually inappropriate with everyone, but makes you feel bad if you take offence because he was "just being fun".
Honestly, you could tell him you're going to pop to the loo and he'll say Yes, you pop to the loo, pull down your knickers, and then I will come in and fuck you.
I mean, this place is ridiculous.
Does anyone ever come here?
I mean, it is creepy as fuck.
Why don't you get her a guinea pig?
It was a surprise hit here.
What, you think she'd like a pig?
Can I take this one?
No, not that one.
Christ, woman, there's something wrong with that one, it's got death in its eyes.
Yeah, the vet says she's depressed.
Oh.
Aren't we all, girl?
You know, guinea pigs can die of loneliness.
Can they?
- Hold her.
- No.
- She needs it.
- No.
Shh!
I have an idea.
He's sexually inappropriate and he eats raw sausages but no-one's made her laugh like he does, so I guess I have to give him that.
Right, just put your What are you doing?
What are you doing?
No.
Stop it.
No, no, no, there.
There we go.
I'm an innocent man.
I bought her a necklace with her name on it, - that she found and told me not to buy.
- OK.
I bought her a book that she already has.
She says not to buy her any clothes because she probably won't wear them.
She scares me!
This sandwich is so good.
Look, this is London.
Just fuck off and buy something weird and expensive.
No, no, it's got to be good, all right.
Help me!
Pay me and I'll help you.
Fuck off.
How much?
Â£60.
- 70.
- Done.
Yeah!
I don't know who she is.
Is she?
No.
What about?
No!
Just get whoever you are.
Who are you?
I don't know.
I want to be that person.
I have been that person.
Ha.
But most of the time I'm that person, like everyone else.
They're good, right?
Chic.
Chic means boring - don't tell the French.
What about these?
No.
God.
Stop checking, all right, nobody loves you.
Help me here.
Who is this person?
Fuck, no.
This is perfect.
Get her something she'd never get herself.
Surprise her.
She'll think I've gone nuts.
No, she'll think you see her as this person, and everyone wants to be this person.
I don't know, I Aren't these for children?
No.
Let's keep going.
I saw some more stuff she'll hate over there.
My neighbour is really fit.
Which one?
- The fit one.
- The one with the sexy big belly?
No, no, he's the other neighbour.
He's like, he's like, OK I'm going to hold his face in my head so you can see him.
OK.
I'm not getting anything.
Make your face his face.
Yeah, OK.
Is he mixed race?
I'm getting mixed race.
Yes!
- That's him.
- Go on.
No.
OK.
OK!
Jesus.
I'm really sorry, we're really high.
We just really wanted to know what you look like.
She thinks you're lovely.
Oh, my God, look at my elegant feet.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey.
Hey.
Hello!
Hey.
HEY!
What's your problem?
Who was that?
Oh, no-one, it was What?
No, no-one.
I just need to go and get a drink, or something.
OK.
Excellent.
Can I go and get my shoes?
Yeah.
OK.
Whoa.
Easy, tiger.
Coming from you?
So, come on, who was that heartbreaker, hmm?
He used to go out with Boo.
Then he slept with someone else, and then she Yeah, yeah, I know, OK.
Fuck.
I've never really said how sorry I was.
You should get the trainers.
She'll say I don't know her.
You don't.
You're just as bad.
It's never clear what she wants.
I should just get her some perfume.
Jesus, just fuck her, please, for the love of a good woman.
Just wrap your willy up in a bow and just screw her, she's going insane.
What is it?
Are you having an affair?
Think you're a clever little puss, don't you?
A little marital poke isn't going to kill you.
Would it kill her to take me out to dinner?
You girls, Jesus.
Anyone said that to her, they'd be hung.
If they were hung, she probably wouldn't be complaining.
Little advice from a married man.
You should probably get yourself out there, sweetie.
You're just tipping your prime.
Another drink?
Bingo.
Excuse me, I have a date.
Get the trainers.
Shop closes in an hour.
Oh, God.
I was not expecting to see you again.
- Shut up.
- I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm chuffed to my boots, but Oh, and thank you for the text, saucy.
Oh, and sorry I'm late.
Oh, no, it's fine, it was last-minute.
- It's really nice to see - No, no, I'm such a tool box.
You know, I'd like to say I was trying to save a puppy, or something, but I just got my coat caught on someone else's coat outside the Tube.
When we went to separate ourselves, it was fucking intense.
I had to give him my coat.
- What are we doing?
- It's my sister's surprise birthday party.
Oh, my God, I love surprises, go on.
But I just thought I need to get her a present first.
Oh, my God, what are you going to get her?
I know this beautiful soap shop.
I mean, this stuff just gets you straight in the bath.
Oh, I was thinking more like Oh, yeah these places all the time So Yup.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Sorry, I won't be long.
Oh, no, no.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, what are you craving?
Oh, just a really, really cheap thrill.
For you?
Oh, hello.
No, it's for her sister.
It's for my very sexually frustrated sister.
Just a basic bunny would be great.
OK, well, I'll see what I can dig out and you go browse.
Thanks.
Oh.
Oh, I think you just do it at the bottom.
It's all in the twist.
Ooh.
Oh.
I know.
You should totally get one of those.
- A vagina?
- Yeah.
Oh, I've already got one.
Really?
You have No You've got one?
I take it with me everywhere.
You lie.
You don't have one on you now?
Yep.
Never going to get it.
Where?
- Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.
- Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.
Ha, you got me.
I don't carry a vagina around with me, that would be way too provocative.
Didn't get it.
OK, so this one's really great.
It's half price because it's quite relentless.
It's called the Burrower.
Basically it doesn't stop until you've cum.
Excuse me.
Oh, don't worry about him, he'll be fine in a minute.
Oh, my God, I love surprise parties.
I love them, I love them, I love them.
Will your parents be there?
- My dad might be - Oh, intense.
Parents adore me.
I want you to be totally in love with me by the end of the night.
OK?
Who's that?
Oh, it's my sister.
- Oh, no!
We're going to ruin the surprise.
- No, no - No, no, no.
- No, really.
- Get down.
It will be fine.
Surprise!
Oh, my God, thank you so much.
I'm so surprised.
She's very good.
How divine.
What a lovely husband you have.
Where is he then?
Ah.
Busy.
I'm blown away.
I had absolutely no idea.
Hildegard, can I just grab you for a second?
- Hello.
- Hello.
Oh, Dad, hi.
Thank you for asking, yeah, I'm essentially a documentary maker.
Docs.
Oh, really?
What is your latest project?
Well, sir, I'm interested in life, and how it affects lots of people in all sorts of different ways.
Yeah, it's awesome.
- How did you meet?
- I met her on a bus.
So easy to pick up girls these days.
I was, like, "Hi", and she was, like, "Take my number".
I was, like, "Yeah".
I'm just going to see if there are any other wines to try.
It's lovely, I'm just going to see if there are some others.
Excuse me.
Can't resist.
Did you find anything nicer?
Oh, I was so sorry to hear about Harry.
Lovely Harry.
Love Harry.
Exciting news about his new job.
Yes, very exciting.
I was so pleased that you'd found someone else so fast.
I just can't stop conjuring an image of you sitting around that cafe, just all alone, feeling so terribly lonely.
Just can't stop picturing it.
I don't think you have to be alone to be lonely.
Dad always taught me that.
Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?
He did.
That's awful, I'm so sorry.
So sweet of you.
Very sweet.
May I cut in?
Yes, of course.
Do you know?
You are the most perfect-looking pair.
Such a great gang.
Do you want some normal food?
No, no.
What I really want you to do is this.
Sorry, nothing happened.
I was trying to be sexy.
It was, it was really sexy.
- Was it?
- What broke?
What broke?
Show me.
Nothing, I just slipped.
Claire, this is my friend Yes, yes, we've already met.
My wife.
My wife.
My wife.
All of your desires are wrapped up in here.
OK.
Open it.
Well, gold has always Wow.
That's really rather wonderful.
Thank you.
What is it?
Is it a paperweight, or?
It is a shrine to your body because I love your body.
- Thank you.
- Wow.
Wow.
This is really Can I Can I see this?
This is really quite something.
Wow, I think it's probably a bit inappropriate for your guests to see your body at this I'm just going to Shall I put it somewhere safe?
Smooth.
I told you I'd find you a buyer.
Your boy, he is hilarious, smart, funny Fuck off.
You'd fuck anything, wouldn't you?
Just don't tell her you got the statue from me, OK?
How much do you want for it?
Finger up the ass, nipple tickle?
Come on, lighten up.
She's going to leave you one day.
You looking forward to that?
You're an asshole.
Hey.
Hey.
I think you took my coat.
Oh.
I'm sorry, that's my coat.
Sorry.
Why you leaving so early?
I have to give Hillary some Earl Grey.
She's not feeling well, so Oh, I got you this.
Oh, I wasn't expecting anything.
It's called a Burrower - it basically won't stop until you cum.
Sounds horrendous.
Thank you.
Good birthday business?
Huge.
You know, I don't want to jinx anything, but huge.
Could be life-changing.
Great.
OK, happy birthday.
Thanks.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Tell the truth.
Are we leaving?
- Yes.
- Birthday girl Awesome party, thank you so much.
We had such a great night.
Oh.
What's that?
Oh.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Night.
Shall we?
Surprisingly bony.
I'm nearly finished.
I'm nearly finished.
It's like having sex with a protractor.
I'm finishing.
I'm finishing.
I'm done.
I'm done.
- I'm done.
- OK.
Yeah.
Are you done?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Amazing.
That was amazing.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.
For fuck's sake.
What?
OK, you don't go through life with teeth like these and not know when someone's pretending.
- What the fuck is that?
!
I'll kick it.
- No, no.
I'll kick it.
What?
Did we catch that, or is that yours?
- That is a rat.
- It's a guinea pig.
That is a rat.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
We haven't heard the opportunity to support any - women-led businesses since the - Sexual harassment case.
Yes, the sexual harassment case.
It's a 7pm arrival tonight for a 7.30 surprise, OK?
Surprise!
Sounds like a blast.
That kind of thing won't get you very far here any more.
- What are you craving?
- Just a basic bunny would be great.
For you?
For my very sexually frustrated sister.
Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?
Just don't tell her you got the statue from me, OK?
You're just tipping your prime.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
You're an asshole.
Tell the truth.
You cannot know this.
No-one can hold a map in their head.
I can!
It's three turnings away.
You're so going to get this wrong.
- Stop it.
- What?
I can feel you judging my driving.
I'm not judging your driving!
Let go of the handle, then.
Oh, we were supposed to go down that turning.
- What?
- Yeah.
- You said three turnings.
- No, I missed one.
Just use your phone, you have a Sat Nav on your phone.
Oh, my God, there, Mindful.
Oh, God.
Farm, there it is.
We're going the right way.
I was right.
Was right.
Do you know what the lesbian app for Grindr is called?
Twat Nav.
Don't make this fun!
It's OK, I'm fucking OK, I'm excellent.
- I know I seem mental, but I'm fine.
- OK.
I just - I just sometimes need you not to - To take the piss.
Don't finish my sentences!
- Take the piss - Out of you and your You don't always know what I'm going to say, OK?
- Sorry.
- Out of Out of her when she's driving.
me while I'm driving.
I'm sorry.
Is it at home or work or Martin?
I'm fine, it's fine.
- Martin's been lovely.
- Really?
It's fine.
I'm OK.
Fucking psycho.
Wow!
Dad really splashed out this time.
He must be about to do something awful.
No, it's just Mother's Day.
- Oh.
- Happy Mother's Day.
We're not supposed to bond on this, are we?
Because I really don't think that's going to end well.
We're not supposed to talk at all.
It's a silent retreat, God help us.
How's everything at the cafe?
You - You really don't have to.
- Thank you.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Good morning.
Hello, hello.
Come on.
They're probably going to think we're a couple.
The fact that your mind even goes there is beyond disturbing.
Hey!
We'd make a really cute couple.
'Sluts!
' Yes?
I'm going to die here.
We're going to be raped and die.
Every cloud Oh, just open the fucking door.
It's been fucking forev  Welcome.
- Thank you so much.
- Hi.
Yeah.
It's really wonderful.
- Really beautiful grounds.
- Extraordinary energy, yeah.
I see you've been gifted this retreat.
How lucky you both are.
I hope after this weekend, you will feel rested, inspired.
- Do you have Wi-Fi?
- No.
Erm, would you like two single beds or a double?
- Two singles.
- A double, please.
- Actually, do you have a separate room?
- I'm afraid not.
Everyone has to share here.
It's part of the communal Singles, then.
Do you get newspapers in the morning?
No, we try to keep the outside world on the outside during your stay here.
You'll appreciate it in the end, I promise.
- So, here is your key.
- Thank you.
- You have a restful weekend.
- You too.
- Wow, no papers.
- You don't read the news.
- Yes, I do!
- What happened yesterday?
Sting wore white jeans and a puppy got stuck in a fan.
Big day.
- What's that for?
- My neck and chest.
- What's that for?
- My legs and knees.
- What's that for?
- Ends of my hair.
- What's that?
- For my under-eyes.
- What's that?
- That is for my face and body.
What would you do if someone stole all of those?
I'd kill myself.
Why are there no plug sockets in here?
Don't touch my stuff.
- What are these for?
- Nothing.
- Mm-hm.
- What?
Well, it's just Why would you bring such tiny batteries?
I'm just prepared.
Just I've only ever - seen them used for remote controls.
- Yes.
- Or alarm clocks.
- Yes, all right.
- And vibrators.
- Yes!
All right!
You didn't have to ask for a separate room!
What?
If you want to have a wank, I can give you some space.
Oh, my God!
No, if you want to take ten minutes, I'll go into the bathroom and moisturise my wrists for a bit.
- You are so immature!
- Oh, give it a minute.
Oh, God.
Seriously!
- What is wrong with your insides?
- Why did you bring the tiny batteries?
A-ha!
You're a genius.
Always know where the reserves are.
Let go of your past.
- Bit on the nose.
- Now is the time to let it go.
Open up your senses, close your mouth and live now.
Welcome to the female-only Breath Of Silence retreat.
Women don't speak.
Erm, sorry.
I think I'm meant to be at - 'Fucking sluts!
' - that one.
Shame.
Yes, the first major consideration is why are you here?
Can anyone here answer that question?
I want to shut the noise out and reconnect to my inner thoughts on the road to feeling more at one with myself.
Excellent attitude.
Well, you're in the right place.
And this weekend is about being mindful.
It's about leaving your voice in your head and trapping your thoughts in your skull.
Think of it as a thought prison in your mind.
Firstly, we're going to teach you how to breathe.
Then we will have a short meditation, then we will find our sanctuary in the partaking of menial tasks, all in perfect silence.
Principal rules are no talking.
If you need to communicate with any of our other superiors, you can write on that board.
Under no other circumstances must you communicate, even with each other.
- What about an emergency?
- Thank you all for coming here today.
No matter what happens, a word must not be heard.
Shh!
'Slut!
' 'Slut!
' 'Bitch!
' 'Bitch, bitch!
'  Fucking bitch!
You fucking piece of shit.
Back here!
Back here, back to me.
Back to me.
All right, now, wherever it's come from your upbringing, your experiences with women, now is the time to turn that around.
To reprogram your mind, your body and your mouth.
To be the better man.
All right?
So, this is Patricia.
Yeah?
She's a friend.
Now, Patricia has just earned a promotion at work, beating over six other candidates.
She's the youngest person to ever achieve this role.
What should we not say when we meet her?
- Clever little munchkin?
- Excellent.
- Who did you blow to get that job?
- OK.
- Slut, you fucking stupid slut.
- OK.
OK.
What should we say to her?
Hmm?
- Well done, Patricia.
- Very good.
"Well done, Patricia".
Please leave.
- Perv.
- Slut.
Wow!
Well done, Patricia.
Slut!
Guys, it's OK.
Keith, come.
Oh, my God.
Excuse me, miss, you can't be here.
- OK.
- You really can't be here.
It's a feel-no-good.
Please.
And now, hands up.
Mirror your palms.
Look each other in the eye, and touch.
Literally her worst nightmare.
Eugh!
Are you all right?
- Talk to me.
- It's nothing.
God.
I can't feel my feet.
Do you remember we used to go top-to-toe?
Now kids are so weird.
- We used to do that all the time.
- Yeah, when we were ten and cute.
- Now we're 30 and angry.
- I'm not suggesting that we Just don't, OK?
Stop stealing my things!
I'm just checking it's working.
Oh, it's working, it's definitely working.
- 'Shh!
' -    Have fun.
It's actually a really thoughtful present.
Thank you.
And Martin getting me that sculpture.
He must have bent over backwards to get something like that.
I feel very lucky.
I have to tell you something.
What?
I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio and then I tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you.
Just don't put it pride of place when Dad well, when they come over.
- OK?
Because - Right.
Claire!
- Claire!
- Shh.
Go to sleep.
Shit.
- The sooner we get on - Ah.
The sooner we get on with it, the sooner we are out of here.
- That's a really nice outfit.
- Thanks.
Delve into your past.
Think of something you can't let go of.
A moment of noise.
A moment of tension.
- Not for now.
- Now a moment when you were peaceful.
If you could change anything in the whole world, what would it be?
My thighs.
In the whole world?
Don't tell anyone I said that.
You?
I've always been insecure about my face.
- You know that.
- I know.
- You shouldn't.
- Thank you, but No, seriously, there's nothing wrong with your nose.
- I mean, there's nothing wrong - Say that again?
- I mean, there's nothing wrong - What?
I don't know.
- Ah!
- Oh, my God.
I always say the wrong thing!
Ah!
Agh!
Hot.
What is this?
I don't even do this in my own home.
Well, it's very simple.
We've paid them to let us clean their house in silence.
Jesus.
I don't want to come down on you like a schoolteacher, but I'm afraid your flagrant lack of respect for the one rule that we have here is now affecting the other students.
- Clients.
- Inmates?
- Cleaners?
- Participants!
Do you have a problem with the programme?
I suggest you try sitting here in silence for the next hour.
It will benefit you.
I swear by my soul, it will.
I went through your bag.
What?
I couldn't find anything, so you're just going to have - to tell me what's going on with you.
-  Talk!
Or I will scream.
-  - I got the Finland promotion.
What Finland promotion?
How can you ask that?
I've told you about it!
I know the Finland promotion, that's amazing.
Thank you.
Does that mean you're a millionaire now?
Handy.
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes, it would.
All that money makes you cry?
I'm turning it down.
What?
Why?
Martin?
Martin says it would be unfair on Jake.
Jake's her stepson, he's really weird, probably clinically, but no-one really talks about that.
He freaks out if she's gone for longer than a day and he's got this thing about trying to get in the bath with her.
No, no.
No, Jake.
No!
He's 15.
- He's not your son.
- That's not the point.
- Go!
- I knew you'd say that.
- This is what you've always wanted.
- I know.
- No more power suits, fuckload of snow.
- I know.
Perfect place for your cold, cold heart.
I know, I can't!
- I have responsibilities.
- Oh, come on.
Don't let other people get in the way of what you really want.
Finland is what you really want.
My husband isn't "other people", OK?
My husband is my life.
Your husband tried to kiss me on your birthday.
Did he?
Did he?
'Sluts!
'  'Sluts!
'    Slut!
- Slut!
- Lovely, lovely.
OK?
Up on your feet.
We're going to say, "Sorry, Patricia".
Sorry, Patricia.
Lovely, give yourselves a round of applause.
All right, guys.
Well done.
We are going to head back to that house better men, yeah?
Well done, good work.
Great stuff.
- Yeah, a new man.
- Well done.
Go on.
You can do it.
You're ready.
Yeah, I thought I recognised you.
Fair enough.
Probably for the best.
So, is your business surviving?
I'm sorry.
No, I don't want that.
So, you're doing the whole silent escape thing.
Indeed.
Going well?
I touched a colleague's breast.
More than once.
At a party, I They asked me to go on a workshop to  I'm just a very disappointing man.
No, thanks, I'm trying to quit.
Those, on the other hand.
They keep asking me, "What do you want from this workshop?
"What do you want"?
I'm not telling them what I want.
I want to move back home.
I want to hug my wife.
Protect my children, protect my daughter.
I want to move on.
I want to apologise.
To everyone.
Want to go to the theatre.
I want to take clean cups out of the dishwasher and put them in the cupboard at home and the next morning, I want to watch my wife drink from them.
And I want to make her feel good.
I want to make her orgasm again.
And again.
Truly.
I just want to cry.
All the time.
Claire?
Have you seen my sister?
'Hi, this is Boo.
'I can't come to the phone right now, 'but please leave me a messiagio, - 'and I'll get back to you.
' -  Someone should probably disconnect that.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- I know I seem mental, but I'm fine.
- OK.
- How's everything at the cafe?
- You really don't have to.
I got the Finland promotion.
- That's amazing!
- Thank you.
- I'm turning it down.
- What?
One of my pieces has gone missing.
You must have bent over backwards to get something like that.
Who's the artist?
I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio.
Mum died three years ago.
She had a double mastectomy, but never really recovered.
Don't let other people get in the way of what you really want.
My husband isn't other people, OK?
My husband is my life!
Your husband tried to kiss me on your birthday.
Did he?
Have you seen my sister?
!
I mean, we're all being very grown-up about this, but Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
Oh, no, it's lovely, thank you.
Your father informed me of your family history.
Yeah, evil boobs everywhere.
Arm up, please.
Stop it!
I'm sorry, I'm just ticklish.
Examined your sister this morning.
Did you?
Does she - Is she all right?
Did she seem all right?
- Yes.
Why?
Erm, just can't get hold of her.
She seemed very busy.
Sure.
Dad books us boob appointments once a year, to make sure our tits don't turn on us like Mum's did.
It's a bit of a hassle but, at the end of the day, it's nice to be touched.
Bet you look forward to seeing Claire.
A lot more to touch, if you know what I mean.
I'm sorry.
It's just there are worse jobs.
Look, erm I check for cancerous lumps in mammary glands.
Now, any pleasure I derive from that is entirely dependent upon whether or not I am about to save your life.
Of course, Doctor.
You can put your clothes back on.
Hey!
Hey!
- She's here.
- I've been waiting out here for nearly 10 minutes.
Yeah, you left me on a fucking Silent Hill.
Yes, well, I had to.
Did you get back OK?
God, this is so stressful.
Mum's memorial lunch.
I should have worn my other coat.
Visiting Dad is hell for Claire.
I see it more as a sport.
It's so inappropriate that she should be here.
- Have you spoken to Martin?
- No, it's fine.
Everything's fine.
- Everything's totally fine.
- It sounds like it's fine.
Can you please just give me some space?
You're standing so close to me!
- Ready?
- No.
Don't tell Dad about Finland.
And don't provoke her.
Let's just get out of this alive, OK?
Girls.
Got to hand it to her.
Hi.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Oh, they're actually for Dad.
Oh, are they freesias?
- Yeah, they were sort of a favourite of - Oh Gosh, how special.
How lovely.
Aren't they stunning?
Aw, let's just leave them there.
Lovely.
Come in.
Who's Dad sawing in half?
- Oh, just the tree.
- Sorry?
The tree in the back garden.
Why are you taking the tree down?
Oh, Felicity tried to use it to get out.
She's very expensive.
This is nice.
Thank you.
Oh, this is beautiful!
I hope you don't mind my being here, but my Pilates fell through, so - Oh, of course.
- No, it's lovely.
It's a sad day.
A sad, sad day.
I'll get the champagne.
I wonder who's going to That's a lovely cushion.
Thanks.
It's an original.
Gosh.
I love your hat.
It's a hair scarf.
Looks like a hat.
Well, it's a hair scarf.
OK.
- Is Martin coming?
- Oh, no.
He's away.
I'm very excited to meet your new chap.
Is he Oh, no, he's a different one.
Ooh.
You do turn over fast!
Dad will come in with some weird canapes in a second.
Girls!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello yeah.
Sorry about all that noise.
- You got a drink?
- Oh Oh, sorry.
I forgot your glass.
You're both looking very healthy, very very good and healthy and Did you talk to Dr Samuels about your?
Yes.
And they're happy, getting along all right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
Great.
Good.
Excellent.
You are my daughters.
- Yep.
- Yes, mmm-hmm.
Yeah, we are.
Sit down.
Erm I think I should say a few words about your mother.
Ignore me.
This day is not an easy one.
Ooh!
Cheers.
To Mum.
To Mum.
To Margaret.
Dearest Margaret.
Just the most generous woman.
- Yeah, well, she certainly was - Yeah, she was great.
It was It was the voice she used for the pigeons.
She always made them sound so rude, you know?
But very, very funny.
She used to take the girls around the park and point at the The squirrel voices were the best.
Run!
- Run!
Fucking run!
- Run-run-run-run-run!
Run-run-run-run!
Yes, yes, my ex had a similar thing - voices and fun.
Really, really funny man.
Really funny.
Can I help you with the food?
Yes, yes, I should And take that off.
So, are you going to Finland?
You're going to have to talk to me eventually.
Plaits.
Either she's got her period or some serious shit's gone down.
She always does something slightly different around her period.
She gets really bad PMT.
Mum used to call it her monthly confidence crisis.
But it's PMT.
The only way she can get through it is to reinvent herself in some small way.
What?
What?
!
I sort of wish you were.
What are you doing?
Just put it back where you got it from, OK?
- No!
- Just do it.
I don't want it in my house.
Come on, what's she going to do?
Draw me?
- Go.
- No.
Why are we sneaking?
- We're not allowed upstairs.
- Of course we are.
God I keep forgetting that she's actually talented.
I know, it's infuriating.
Go on, then.
Where's her head?
She's got your boobs - she doesn't need one.
OK OK.
Hey Is everything OK?
With Martin?
You've invited someone today?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's horrifically hot - you're going to puke when you see him.
Are you on your period?
- Why would you ask that?
- The plaits.
- No reason.
- Say it.
- The plaits.
Hey  I think you should take your nose out of other people's marriages.
Ooh!
Sneaking a preview, are we?
Sorry, I spilled my champagne and I got distracted on my way to the bathroom.
Me too.
It's really beautiful work.
Thank you.
Let me show you to the loo.
Oh, that's all right.
I grew up in this house.
It's all changed now, though.
Your father's in the kitchen.
Oh, great.
I'll go and torment him.
He hates being alone in a room with me.
Watch this.
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh!
Uh oh Ah erm I just need some - Just need - What do you need?
- I need some salt.
There it is.
Oh.
Here it is, yeah.
So, erm how are you, darling?
Have you got enough clothes?
I can never have enough clothes.
And how is the cafe?
Erm Well, the lease is up in a couple of days, and I don't think I can really afford to I think I'm just going to have to accept that it's I'm sorry about that, darling.
But, of course, we're just a little bit tight on the purse strings, too.
Oh, no, I wasn't asking you for any We've just been keeping it quiet.
We haven't been able to to buy anything or do anything, and Ooh What's that?
Oh, that?
That's just a tiny little house we're we're buying in, erm in France.
Lovely.
Yeah.
I I just wanted to talk to you about this exhibition.
What exhibition?
- Oh, no!
- Jesus, Dad!
Again?
Oh, no, it doesn't Pick it up, pick it up!
Help me pick these up.
Please, please!
She mustn't see it.
- She mustn't find out.
- OK, OK Mmm, five second rule.
No, I have never bought into that rule.
It's disgusting.
What are you doing?
- Oh, just a little family tradition.
- Oh.
What odd fun.
What are the rules?
Oh!
Thank God.
That'll be your man.
I mean, I didn't want to show off, but Gosh You really are So, how did you two meet?
Fucked me up the arse.
I used to manage a bar, and I just found her crying, in the toilet one night.
How about you two?
How did you two meet?
Through our mother, actually.
How's work, Claire?
Oh.
Fine.
Nothing new.
She used to be our godmother.
Still am.
But then their parents split up Mum died.
And we just became even closer friends.
Actually, you know - and I can say this because I'm an artist - but you really are very good-looking.
Thank you.
Very.
Thank you.
Very.
Thank you.
I mean, almost too good-looking.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and do that old human thing.
How's the exhibition going?
Ah, yes, yes, erm I wanted to talk to you about that.
Talking about me?
- Very favourably.
- All good things, I swear.
Oh, and again  - Have you found a venue?
- What exhibition?
Thank you so much for asking.
- We have, actually - Erm There are some elements of the work that I, you know, I wanted to talk to you about.
It's a "sexhibition".
But, don't panic, it's nothing scary.
It's simply a journey through my physical and sexual life, climaxing in a few pieces inspired by and moulded on your father.
And there are photos.
I've taken a photo of my naked body every year for the past 30 years.
Why?
Well, I think it's important for women of all ages to see how my body has changed over the years.
I think they have to have a healthy perspective on my body.
- Don't they?
- Oh, erm, absolutely.
I mean, I don't need to tell you, but your father is a deeply sexual man.
No, you don't.
Just did.
- Knew it.
- I'm just very lucky.
I will be touched until the day I die.
And so will you, Claire.
I mean, it's really all that humans want - is to be loved and to be touched.
Erm Tell Dad about your promotion, Claire.
There's nothing to tell.
What promotion?
- Finland.
- Oh!
- Odd place.
- Any news?
No.
- She got it.
- Oh!
Fuck's sake!
Congratulations, Claire.
- Thank you.
- Clever girl!
Can we not?
This is so exciting She's turning it down.
- Why?
- Why?
Why, why not?
Why, Claire?
Claire, are you pregnant?
Why aren't you getting on a plane to your gold rich future?
- This is everything you've worked for - Why?
Because you CAN'T just fuck off on aeroplanes, and leave your weird stepson and broken sister to fend for themselves, OK?
Excuse me.
She's your sister, it's your job to annoy her No, no, I'm just so annoyed with myself!
I wish I could just meet myself and just have a go at myself!
Do your worst.
Come on, bitch!
You don't take yourself seriously.
Ooh pussy.
You need to reach out to your family.
You need to stop provoking your sister - just grow up.
You do not take yourself seriously as a businesswoman, you need to pay your fucking bills, you need to be nicer to Hillary and you need to get a new hat!
Is that better?
Yeah, it's better.
OK  Off you go.
The art work in this house is stunning.
Who is it?
If I tell you, will you promise to come to my sexhibition?
It's not your work Will you come?
It would be an honour.
How's your little restaurant?
It's a cafe.
Oh, don't do it a disservice.
I'm not.
It's a cafe.
Oh, sorry.
It's fine.
It's fine.
- Your father tells me you're struggling.
- Well I think we all are.
Oh, well, yes.
But, I mean, now there's only one of you God, I can't imagine what you've been through.
I'm sorry, have I missed something?
Well her dear little friend died, and left her to run the cafe on her own.
Oh, God, that is truly awful.
How did she die?
- Oh, she killed herself.
- It was an accident.
Well Maybe it's time to let the little restaurant go.
Give it up.
Sell it - have a little holiday.
We did this.
Mmm-hmm.
And, whatever happens, we never let it go, OK?
Excuse me.
Have you seen Felicity?
Oh, no, sorry.
Gosh, all sorts of things go missing in this house, don't they?
- Big house.
- Yes, lovely house.
Oh, the sculpture turned up.
- Did it?
- Yes.
Must have just toppled off the side.
Well, if you rid a woman of her head and limbs, you can't expect her to do anything other than roll around.
What?
Oh Your father and I often say, when you've had a few drinks, you're so like your mother.
Oh, whoops.
Look at these.
So, the party's moved to the hallway.
Always a good sign.
Does anyone mind if I leave?
I've got a dicky tummy.
So swift Thanks.
I'm not going to kiss you because I'm probably very ill.
You too.
Come on.
Goodbye then, my my daughters.
Goodbye.
What a lovely occasion.
Yeah.
See you at the sexhibition.
No, there's absolutely no need to - Yes, lovely.
- No, no - I'll definitely be there.
I will definitely be there.
Hold up!
You trying to keep me overnight?
Very good-looking.
I might never see you again, but you're very good-looking.
Yes, yes very good-looking.
Thanks, I owe you.
No, I owe you.
It's been really nice to spend the day with a normal family.
I actually feel quite emotional.
Will you stay with me tonight?
Sure.
I'm going to go warm up the bike.
- Lovely to meet you, Claire.
- You too.
Erm what's his?
- Fucked me up the arse.
- Oh.
- Yep.
It's - Mm-hmm.
I totally see that now.
I'm sorry I was Listen to me.
I'm going to leave Martin.
I'm going to give you the money for the cafe, and I'm going to go to fucking Finland.
OK.
Oh, and, erm That is the coolest thing you've ever done.
I know.
Thanks, Claire.
Shall we?
We can try.
- I'll see you at the sexhibition.
- Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
- Just put it back where you got it from, OK?
- No.
Thank you for coming in today.
I've read your application.
- It was funny.
- Oh!
Your husband tried to kiss me on your birthday.
So, how did you two meet?
He fucked me up the arse.
So, is your business surviving?
The lease is up in a couple of days, and I don't think I can really afford to Oh!
Sneaking a preview, are we?
It's a sexhibition.
Inspired by and moulded on your father.
I will definitely be there.
I'm leaving Martin.
I'm going to give you the money for the cafe, - and I'm going to go to fucking Finland.
I'll see you at the sexhibition.
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!
- Oh!
- Oh, look at me.
I want to see those tiny things again.
- Oh!
- Ugh!
Stay sexy.
Stay sexy.
Those tits.
- Oh!
OK.
Yeah!
- They are so fucking tiny.
May I?
Oh, yeah.
Erm.
Oh, God.
There's always a stage when someone's falling in love with you that they lose their erection.
They get confused, they panic, the stakes get too high, the blood rushes from their dick to their heart.
- Oh, Jesus.
- And everything is fucked.
Oh!
What?
Oh, no, I don't think Hillary is going to want to hear this.
Oh, go on.
- No.
- Oh, go on.
OK, an 11-year-old boy was put in juvenile prison for repeatedly sticking rubber ended pencils up his school hamster's arsehole.
- What?
- Yeah.
Why would they do that?
Apparently he liked it when their eyes popped out.
No, why would they send him away?
He needs help.
She was a surprising person.
They shouldn't have just locked him up.
He pencil-fucked a hamster.
Yeah, but he's obviously not happy, happy people wouldn't do things like that.
- Fair point.
- And anyway, that's the very reason why they put rubbers on the end of pencils.
To fuck hamsters?
No, because people make mistakes.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- Look, about last night.
- Uh-oh.
I don't usually connect with women.
I know, that's what I like about you.
Yeah, OK, erm.
I, erm  Wow.
This must be what insecure feels like.
Actually, can we speak about this later?
I want to find the right words for you.
I'll see you at the sexhibition?
- Yeah, I'll see you there.
- I'm going to go to yoga.
OK.
- Marvellous.
- I'm so relieved you're here.
Hi.
And, hello, good looking.
Hello.
Thank you.
- Well clung to.
- Thank you.
Does it get very boring, everyone telling you how gorgeous you are all the time?
- A little.
- Should we, erm Oh, yes, I won't forget this, I promise.
Oh, sure.
Is Claire here yet?
No, not yet, you're an angel for being here.
Would you just hold on to that?
There are bottles for topping up on the little bar just inside.
I'm the luckiest thing to have you.
And, erm there.
You're a natural.
No, really, though, this sexhibition isn't about me trying to get you all aroused, it's about the beauty of sex.
And how it brings us all together.
How it excites and connects, how it opens people's minds, after all, sex got us all here.
Sex brings life.
I've been building this sexhibition since I was 11 and a quarter, which is when I first climaxed by accident on a bidet.
The bidet is, of course, exhibited here, as are all of the pieces from my first ever sexhibition.
All apart from one.
A few weeks ago one of my most delicate pieces was stolen from my studio.
But in a sense it was a blessing.
In fact, her brutal snatching made me think of the women of the world they've been robbed of their freedom, of their happiness, and, in the saddest of cases, of their bodies.
So in many ways I have to thank the thief for creating my most profound piece of work to date A Woman Robbed.
Now, I would ask you all to leave your genitals at the door and bring your minds to these pieces.
I don't believe people always think about sex when they see a naked body, I believe they think about their own minds, their own bodies, and their own power.
And that's what this show is really about it's about power.
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Claire, it's me, just wondering where you are, because I am very much here and waiting for you.
OK, bye.
Dammit, Claire.
Have you seen a sort of stressed out version of me anywhere?
Is it weird that my mouth's watering?
It's really fantastic work, honestly, it's amazing.
Thank you so much.
Yes, it's extraordinary.
Really, really moving.
Present.
I'd love one of these on my floor like a rug with perks.
I'm sure you would, but it's very securely nailed to the wall this evening.
- Have you found your father yet?
- Oh, yes, I think he's by the coats.
Oh, no, no, have you found your father yet?
It's just so very obvious to me.
Yeah.
- Oh, Connor.
- Whoops.
Look, about this morning Listen, what I was trying to say is - Here we go.
- I didn't realise this until we were having sex earlier and - I lost my - Erection.
- Erection.
- One more time.
Erection.
But it made me realise I'm in love.
Oh.
OK, I mean, I don't really know what to I don't want to have sex with anyone else, and that's never happened to me before.
I'm in love.
And I need to tell her.
- Her?
- Yeah, we've been together for a couple of months.
And physically she just never satisfied me, she has these really massive, bouncy tits that really don't do anything for me.
And you just kept turning up like this sexy plank.
And it confused me.
I just don't think I should be fucking around behind her back any more.
I just thought I should say that I am sorry if I have led you on.
Oh, no.
God, no, my ex is due back any day now anyway, so, it's erm I'm happy for you.
I I knew you wouldn't give a shit.
What can I say?
I'm sorry, I don't give a shit.
Cool.
Never wear padding, OK?
Claire, where are you?
I can't survive much longer in this sea of penises.
I don't know anyone.
And, so Harry?
Harry?
- Hi.
- Hi.
What did she do to you?
We just, you know, covered me in plaster and left me in the garden for a couple of hours.
Oh, God, hi.
Oh, it's so good to see you.
Oh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm just going to go and browse around.
It was really nice to meet you.
You, too.
That's Elaine.
- We're - Did you see that really good-looking guy that came in with me?
No, but I saw a really good-looking guy on his motorbike outside, why?
Oh, yeah, that's, he, erm, well, he and I Oh!
Great.
Yeah, he just dumped me, so Oh!
I'm sorry.
This is very you.
Yeah, yeah, she said you were cool with us doing that.
I don't I don't know why she where's my penis?
Oh, it's on the wall over there, second from the left.
Oh.
I should probably go and find Elaine, she doesn't like being left on her own.
You've still got some stuff at the flat.
I've been rolling around in my lingerie, all over it, waiting for you to come and collect it.
- Yeah - Just your Tupperware, and your TV, and your dinosaur plate.
Oh, I got a new dinosaur plate, but, erm Yeah, but, thank you, but, you can keep those.
Hey, do you still wank about me sometimes?
No.
Elaine.
Claire.
My God, it's been hell, where have you been?
I, erm All parked up.
Hello, you.
We almost didn't make it, but, erm We didn't want to let the old boy down.
- I thought - We're just going to do a quick whizz around, to show our faces.
OK, but We're just going to do a quick whizz around.
Sorry, could you just, could you do something with those?
Thank you.
Don't!
The joys of butter-fingered staff.
Stop making a spectacle of yourself and clean that up.
You clean that up.
Apologise.
I'm sorry.
Turns out I'm not such a natural after all.
Oh, fuck off.
I'm just going to say this once I deserve to be happy, I am allowed to move on, I have a good life and I'm happy, all right?
All right?
If you don't mind I'm going to go and get my cardy from the car.
It's a little chilly.
I'm sorry you had to hear that but you did have to hear it.
No, no, she'll do it.
- What the fuck was that?
- What is he doing here?
You're not going to Finland.
Oh, God.
What are you doing here?
I'm helping.
- He is - He didn't try to kiss you.
- He did.
- He says it was more like the other way around.
What?
Well, that's just not true.
No, fuck you.
- Claire.
- Please don't - No, Claire, he came out into the garden - I don't want to hear it.
- Claire, you have to believe me.
How can I believe you?
Because I'm your sister.
After what you did to Boo?
He slept with someone else, he said, he told me he fucked someone else.
I'm sorry, but you just have to see it from my point of view.
Come on.
I think I love him.
I'm going to hurt myself, I'm going to get hit by a bike, and then hurt my finger and then he's going to have to come and see me in the hospital and be really sorry for what he did.
I don't know where you came from.
What, you don't think we are the same?
You have the same lines on your forehead as me.
Thank you for fixating on them.
- And you're stubborn.
- Snap.
- And sad.
- Not born sad.
- Some people are.
- You weren't.
No, I guess not.
Jesus, why do daughters get to say that they're fucked up by their fathers when it's so often the other way round?
Why do you do that to yourself?
Looks cool.
I think your mother would have admired your little performance up there.
Do you ever think about her?
Yeah.
Do you think about your friend?
- All the time.
- Well I'm sorry.
I think you should go.
'Hi, this is Boo.
I can't come to the phone right now, 'but please leave me a messiagio and I'll get back to you.
' 'Hi, this is Boo.
I can't come to the phone right now, 'but please leave me a messiagio and I'll get back to you.
' Are you OK?
Big night, then?
Mmm.
What?
I thought in the application for your loan it said you ran a cafe for guinea pigs.
That's why I thought it was funny.
I never thought guinea pigs needed It's guinea pig themed.
- OK.
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.
Yeah.
Can I get you a cup of tea?
I've run out.
Coffee?
Run out.
Well, I should probably be heading back to the office.
Cafes are a very difficult business.
You've certainly made this one very unique.
I also fucked it into liquidation.
OK.
And I fucked up my family.
Did you?
And I fucked my friend by fucking her boyfriend.
Right.
And sometimes I wish I didn't even know that fucking existed.
And I know that my body, as it is now, really is the only thing I have left, and when that gets old and unfuckable I may as well just kill it.
And somehow there isn't anything worse than someone who doesn't want to fuck me.
I fuck everything except for when I was in your office, I really wasn't trying to have sex.
You know, everyone feels like this a little bit, and they're just not talking about it, or I'm completely fucking alone which isn't fucking funny.
Right, well I should probably, erm I should probably, erm I should probably People make mistakes.
It's why they put rubbers on the ends of pencils.
Is that a joke?
I don't know.
I think we should start your interview again.
Here?
Yeah.
Go on.
OK.
Well, thank you for coming in.
No problem.
I've read through your application form.
It says you run a cafe for guinea pigs.
Told you it was funny.
