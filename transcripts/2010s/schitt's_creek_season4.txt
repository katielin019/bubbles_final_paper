1 -  -   Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon virgin, Mother and child Holy infant, so tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly Sleep in heavenly peace -  -  Oh, thank you, thank you.
Now, Aretha will be out in just a moment.
Oh, who needs Aretha, when we have you, darling?
Ha ha!
Paul Shaffer, you are my most cherished friend!
And, worth every penny.
Oh, you guys are too kind.
And now a special little sec David, you can step aside now, dear.
Paul: There he goes, David Rose.
And now, a special little secular something I'd like to dedicate to my husband, Mr. Johnny Rose!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Johnny!
Moira: John?
John, you're talking in your sleep again.
Oh.
What day is it?
Christmas Eve.
Wake me when it's over.
-  - David: Ah!
- Johnny: Kids!
- Alexis: Ugh!
Outta bed, it's Christmas Eve, and this year we will be celebrating the holiday!
I'm good, thanks, though.
Okay, can you turn the lights off, please?
No, I refuse to turn off the light on Christmas again, this year.
I understand not wanting to make a fuss our first year.
We were depressed, and in shock.
- Last year - Less shock, deeper depression.
Well, I was going to say, we were finally making some headway.
Okay, so what exactly is your proposal, then?
Well, I say we throw a party.
Just like the old days.
Invite some people over, sing some carols.
Okay, you know today is Christmas Eve, right, and maybe people don't wanna spend it like, caroling in front of mom's wig wall?
I can't think of a more festive way to spend Christmas Eve, than all of us pitching in.
Okay, I just don't know how we're gonna pull this off without the grand piano, or the ice sculptures.
Or the reindeer room.
I'm afraid this whim of yours is going to obliterate our precious holiday memories.
Well, that's exactly the point, Moira.
We have to make new memories.
We have to start looking forward, not backward.
Now, you and I will get the tree.
David, you're in charge of the decorations, 'cause I don't wanna hear I've made another mistake.
Alexis, I trust you can handle the guest list?
Oh, okay, re the guest list, um, unfortunately, Ted and I will be unable to attend.
Why?
Cancel your plans!
Ted is certainly welcome here!
Okay, what about the gift situation then, because everything on my list requires pre-order.
Okay, come on, let's get dressed, everybody.
We're running out of time!
Look at you, Mr. Rose, seemingly possessed by the Christmas spirit.
Ha, ha!
That reminds me, somebody needs to find the menorah.
- - David, we can have drinks literally any night.
Christmas with your family sounds like fun.
Yeah, it was fun, like way, way, way back.
We used to throw these lavish Christmas parties.
- I'm sure you read about them.
- I have not.
I see.
Well they were big, and they were fun.
And, ever since we moved here, we just sort of decided to fast forward through the holidays.
Well, as somebody who would love to be celebrating with his family back home, I think it's nice that your Dad's planning something.
Stevie: Hello.
- Merry Christmas, Patrick!
- Merry Christmas, Stevie!
Do I not get a Merry Christmas, or ?
I thought you were Jewish?
I'm a delightful half-half situation, which is why it's so annoying that my Dad thinks he can boss people around on a holiday that he technically has no authority over.
Well, can whichever half is feeling the most generous give me a discount on two cases of wine, please?
How many people does he think are showing up to this thing?
Oh, he only wanted one case.
I have my own holiday tradition.
It's like the 12 Days of Christmas, but it's 1 day with 12 bottles of wine.
That sounds like fun.
Are we supposed to be doing anything for this party?
Um, yes, decorations, but even if we could still afford Nate Berkus, I'd burned that bridge in Ibiza.
Okay, but we have plenty of decorations here, so.
Yeah, that are for sale.
We're not just giving away our inventory.
Wow.
So, what time is the Ghost of Christmas Past - coming to visit you tonight?
- Ooh, burn, David!
Anyway, I'm sure there's something at the motel.
Don't you guys put up decorations over the holidays?
Um, Nana Bud used to.
There's a box in the attic.
Okay, so you do have decorations, then.
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be up to your standards.
Well, they'll have to do, because at this point, the party's at 7, and I don't have any time to mood-board a color scheme.
Okay.
Thank you.
Do you have time to mood-board a color scheme?
- Does anyone?
- No.
Knock, knock.
Hey!
Come in!
Smells so good in here!
Look at you in that flouncy apron, you little Christmas Elf!
I'm gonna take that as a compliment, even though everything inside me's telling me that it's not.
What have we here?
Ah, it's just a bit of a tradition at Christmas parties that I have with my friends.
See, we do a cookie competition, and then the winner gets to take home all of the leftovers to their families on Christmas Day.
So cute.
I basically did exactly the same thing with my friends once.
But instead of cookies, it was whatever we could find in our parents' medicine cabinets, and instead of a Christmas party, it was an old boot factory in Krakow.
Well, I, I did get up at the Krak-ow dawn, so that Alexis could bake these cookies.
Alexis didn't bake these cookies, though.
Yeah, no, I know, I just thought that we would say that you did, so that we could give you a leg-up with my friends.
Why would I need a leg-up with your friends?
No, no reason.
They are very excited to meet you.
-  - Just It did take a bit of convincing, after the called-off engagement s. But, they have all agreed to give you one last chance.
What?
I shouldn't have said one last chance, I just meant like, one more final chance.
I-I'm making this sound worse than it is.
They-they're gonna love you.
Wow, what if something came up and I couldn't come?
Yeah.
What if I missed chest and back day?
Rather not think about it.
- Wait did something come up?
- No, no.
Not at all.
Um, my Dad just had this last minute idea of um, throwing a Christmas party tonight.
So something did come up?
I-I had thought that you said that your family doesn't celebrate Christmas?
Well, we don't, normally.
I honestly don't know what he's thinking.
Okay, but I don't wanna keep you from your family.
You're not.
I do want to meet your cool, scary, judgy friends, and the last thing I wanna do is cause you any trouble.
So, why don't you just double this cookie recipe, and we'll drop a batch off to my parents on our way?
O Kay, that's just 72 more cookies to make, then.
Oh, isn't this festive?
It's like an old-fashioned country Christmas, huh Moira?
Picking out a fresh-cut tree?
No, all I can think about is the 22' Norwegian Pine we once had.
And the protestors, shouting at the flatbed truck as it made its way through our front gates.
Now that was festive.
Well, obviously we'll be looking at something a bit more modest this year.
But this time, at least, we get to pick out the tree ourselves.
Mm, smell those pine needles.
Oh, hi, Mr. Rose.
What you're smelling is actually our holiday-scented car ornaments.
They can be used in the car, or on your tree.
Sold separately, of course.
Looks like you're down to your last little saplings, Raymond.
Yes, so we're selling these for a special price.
Ah, see, the Christmas spirit is all around us.
Oh, I'm sorry, by special, I meant higher price, because of demand.
Oh.
Well, that's all right.
The tree's just a gesture.
We don't need anything fancy.
Okay, well, these over there are $100 per gesture, or 2 gestures for $175.
Let's go.
I've had enough waking hours for one day.
Moira, can I uh, see you in private, for a minute?
Please, take your time.
Although uh, keep in mind, with our inventory dwindling, we're surge-pricing right now.
- Ah.
- Hmm.
Oh.
Tell me this, sweetheart, have I asked you for a lot this year?
It depends, are we talking emotionally?
You know, in the old days, I stood by your side no matter how you wanted to spend the holidays.
Whether it was heading to Miami for Puff Daddy's Poolside White Party, or that uncomfortable tree trimming at Arnold and Maria's.
How 'bout the night you wore your fur coat to the PETA Christmas Fundraiser?
I hear Peter Fundraiser.
Bogdanovich loved a mink.
Well, I'd love it if you could just be a little more on-board with all of this.
Okay, John, for you.
And Christmas.
Okay, thank you, Moira.
Ray?
How's it looking, Moira?
Is it straight?
Oh, straight as an arrow.
Ah, good.
Oh, David, Stevie.
That tree's not straight.
Huh?
I don't know, it's pretty straight.
Let's see what we got here.
Lights.
We're missing a lot of bulbs, but, we'll make do.
What else?
What's this, a pumpkin?
Perhaps a Christmas gourd.
It's not a Christmas gourd, Moira.
I know, John, but you requested I get on board.
That was me getting on board.
David, what's going on here?
This, this stuff is garbage.
Um, it's Stevie's grandmother's decorations?
And by garbage, Stevie, you know, I I mean, Oh, no, no, no.
It's it's bad.
- What's this?
- Those would be Mardi Gras beads.
Nanna Bud worked real hard for those.
So we're getting warmer.
This is all you could find, David?
You own a store!
Where where are all the decorations that you sell in your store?
Um they're at the store, being sold.
I couldn't just bring everything home, just because you wanted to have a party at the last minute.
We're saving for stuff.
Oh, well that's very responsible.
- What are you saving for?
- An espresso machine.
You're selling coffee now?
Hmm it's more for the staff room.
I'm gonna just go get that wine.
It's for the staff room?
So you couldn't bring home decorations for your family on Christmas because you're saving money for a coffee maker for yourself?
I believe he said espresso machine.
You're not helping, Moira.
What is everybody yelling about?
Well, we have a Christmas tree, but no decorations because your brother's a cheap-ass!
And right now we have the most un-Christmassy looking room, that'll soon be filled with party guests Speaking of, how's the guest list coming, Alexis?
I don't know, you tell me!
Why would I tell you?
You were in charge of the guest list!
Well, it's hard to be in charge of the guest list, if no one's given it to me yet.
Why would anybody give it to you?
You were in charge of making it!
Making it?
I thought you wanted me to handle it?
Like, work the door, make sure nobody gets in that isn't on the list!
It's Christmas Eve, Alexis!
Who's going out crashing other people's Christmas parties?
- Ugh!
- Knock!
Knock!
- Any room left at the inn?
-  I hope you guys all like gingerbread.
Oh, you're too sweet.
Oh no, it was the least we can do, just sorry that we couldn't stick around for the party tonight.
- What's that?
- You didn't tell him?
- Oh, my god.
- Okay, I hate this!
I opened red, I hope that's okay with everyone?
Alexis, I thought we agreed that you and Ted would be coming here tonight?
I know, but Ted's friends are having a thing, and everyone low-key hates me.
Uh, hate is a strong word.
Do you know what I think might put this jolly trolley back on track?
The release of the tree.
Are you kidding me, Moira?
I don't see much point in doing that now.
- No, release it.
- Alexis: Yes.
And I'll put the Jerry beads on the tree.
We're not putting Mardi Gras beads on a Christmas tree, Alexis!
John, please, do the honors.
Yay.
W I, for one, find it charming, in sort of a a war-torn sort of way.
If we rotate it?
Allow me.
I can do that.
I'll just No, no, actually we don't wanna do that.
Looks like the other side has been charred, or something.
Um, what if we cut it up and turned it into garlands?
Why don't we just cut it up for firewood?
No this, this was a really stupid idea, a little Christmas party.
Something to temporarily take our minds off things.
But clearly this was too much for all of you.
And you're right, why start making an effort now?
John?
I'm gonna take a walk.
It's meatloaf night at the cafe, and if anything is screaming Christmas to me right now, it's meatloaf.
Okay I didn't wanna say anything, but meatloaf night was yesterday.
Dear God, I - Good night.
- Good night.
David?
Alexis?
- Moira, have you seen the kids?
- Whose kids?
Our kids?
That ship sailed hours ago, dear.
Literally, Alexis and Stavros are on his father's yacht by now.
Off to Capri.
Ah.
And David?
Hm, David, last I heard he was screaming at Wolfgang.
Apparently there weren't enough capers - on the smoked salmon crudites.
- Ah.
I thought we could open presents tonight.
Oh don't worry, I already gave them their checks.
- Quite something, isn't it?
- Hmm.
- All this?
- Yeah.
Moira, come stand here with me for a minute.
John, you know I would, but I've already taken my Christmas pills, and bitter experience has taught me I have just 8 minutes to make it safely up the stairs.
Woman's Voice: Mr. Rose?
Twyla: Mr. Rose!
Can I take your plate?
Oh, yes, yes, Twyla, and please, thank the kitchen for the meatloaf.
I could've sworn it was Wednesdays.
- It's always been Tuesdays.
- Oh.
Is everything okay, Mr. Rose?
Why wouldn't it be, it's Christmas Eve?
And yet, here you are, eating yesterday's meatloaf.
Hi, John.
Moira.
Twyla, thank you.
I hope he didn't keep you too late.
I'm sure you have somewhere to be.
Actually, I do, but you guys take as long as you want.
- George will lock up.
- Merry Christmas, Twyla.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Rose.
Dinner is on us.
Well, this isn't right, you sitting here alone.
Oh, I don't know, it feels pretty familiar.
Yes, I guess we've established a pretty grim tradition these past few years.
Well, I'm not talking about these past few years, I was talking about the old days.
Do you even remember how those big, lavish Christmas parties used to end?
I think that's the sign of a successful soiree, if you don't.
I'd find myself standing alone, staring at the tree, and all I'd want, I just thought, in spite of all the hardship that We found ourselves coming together, the kids, you, and me, as a family.
And it just seemed like the perfect day to celebrate that.
The perfect day for a Rose Family Christmas Party.
John, I'm sorry.
On behalf of the children, for myself, I'm sorry, John.
We didn't fully understand why this party was so important to you.
Well, doesn't matter now.
No, guess we should get a move on.
Ah, uh uh.
Oh, there's no booze in that!
Ew!
Ew!
Hm, the one nice thing about living in this desolate, lonely place, is it can, at times, be quite peaceful.
Well, it wasn't too peaceful this afternoon, I'm sorry to say.
Oh, nah, it wouldn't be the holidays without at least one good family fight.
No, but what was I thinking, Moira?
Springing this party idea on everyone was a little last minute.
It appears there's been a Christmas miracle, John.
All: Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, John.
- Oh.
Oh, David!
Is this the same tree?
Uh, theoretically.
We have spent a very long time gluing it back together.
Scary amount of super glue.
Seriously, nobody should light a match in here.
- Mm hmm.
- And Everyone chipped in.
And there might have been a few things leftover at the store.
So - Who wants bubbly?
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Rose.
Merry Christmas, Dad.
You know I hate to miss a good party.
See?
I knew you could handle a guest list.
And um, just a heads up, Ted's vet friends are coming by later, and I have a sneaking suspicion they're a little bit - But, hmm.
-  - Room looks good.
- Mm hmm.
You still thinking about that espresso machine, aren't ya?
Yes.
Yes, I am.
- One day.
- Mm hmm.
Hey, Johnny, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Roland.
Little last minute, this little party of yours, huh?
Well, it seems last minute turned into last second.
Well, all I'm saying is, next time um, I'd appreciate my invitation about a week in advance, okay?
Well, if I have things my way, we'll be making this an annual tradition, so you can save the date now.
No, that's way too far in advance, I can't make that kinda commitment.
Okay, Roland.
Moira, it's so wonderful - that you made this happen for Johnny.
- Yeah.
But, we were supposed to be caroling at the senior's center 30 minutes ago.
Oh, Jocelyn, surely the dentures have been dropped in the glass by now.
Can't we spare one carol here, before we go?
- Why not.
- Yes.
Twyla?
Silent night Holy night All is calm All is bright Round yon virgin Mother and Child Holy Infant So tender and mild Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Oh sleep What, it's just nice.
Nothing's happening.
Looks like you're crying.
Oh well, I'm not.
It's just we're - We ran out of red!
- Oh.
Sleep in heavenly peace Sleep in heavenly peace Anyone interested in opening a gift tonight?
I thought you said we weren't doing presents?
Well, you kids were so upset about there being no presents, The Church had a small rummage sale this morning, so I popped in.
Close your eyes, Moira.
Smaller, smaller, smaller.
A bomb?
- No, it's an antique tin.
- Oh.
- For your wig pins.
- Oh.
- David: Hmm.
- Ooh.
Little something for you, Alexis.
Stickers!
Of old men!
No, they're stamps, from all over the world.
- David, I know you like money.
- Yes.
It's what looks like 1,000 Yen.
Yeah.
Hm.
It's like being right back in Japan.
Okay, okay, let's just smile and say thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, you know, reminds me, I was worried about this menorah being so close to the garland.
Last thing we want is to have the motel burn down.
- Or is it?
- What?
{END OF EPISODE 0}{START OF EPISODE 1}
1     - Ah!
Ha, now that is what I call a beautiful morning!
Looks like another full house tonight.
Things are starting to look up, sweetheart.
- Big waves!
Big waves!
-  Oh yes.
Yes, tidal waves of prosperity are crashing down, all around us.
Soon enough.
You just wait.
Hey partner, what's the good word?
There's a dead guy in Room 4.
What?
Whadda ya mean there's a dead guy in come in, come in.
Moira: Did I hear what I think I heard?
- Has someone been killed?
- Stevie: No.
No!
No, John, no.
No!
I have endured a cornucopia of trauma that last few years, I draw the line at living in a crime scene.
Okay, nobody's been murdered, Mrs. Rose.
I went in to clean Room 4, and this old guy was like, asleep in his bed.
But like, forever asleep.
Like, checked out without paying, asleep.
Okay, I think it's a little early for humor, Stevie.
Oh, I'm sorry, did you just see a dead body?
What did this gentleman look like?
- I don't know, like old.
- John old?
Or old, old?
Well, I don't quite see the relevance in that question, Moira, the man is dead.
I mean we can't have the other guests finding out about a dead body in one of the rooms.
- Ugh!
- Ew!
There's a dead body - in one of the rooms?
- Okay, I always knew there'd be a murder here eventually.
I'm gonna go pack up my things, I assume we're moving?
We're not packing up our things, and everybody just calm down.
Nobody's been murdered.
Okay, the old man in Room 4 died alone in his sleep.
Why do I find that scenario even more bone-chilling than murder?
Stevie, do we know how this man expired?
Do I look like a coroner?
I don't think you want people answering that question.
It feels like every time the motel sells out, someone dies.
Uh, we've only sold out one night.
Exactly.
So you and Patrick are sitting in his car last night, and you just leaned in and kissed him?
Okay, what part of this conversation - don't you understand?
- Okay, and he wanted that.
Yes.
Like he told you that he wanted that.
Fall off a bridge, please.
You gave me such a hard time for getting involved with Ted, and then you just French your business partner literally the second he peeks his head out of the closet.
I'll have you know this is the healthiest first day of a relationship I've ever had.
Well, all I know is that Patrick is a sweet little button face, David, so don't mess this up.
-  - Johnny: Oh good, I'm glad you're both still here.
We're gonna need your room for the night, so uh, pack up.
- Um, no.
- Absolutely not.
Johnny: The motel is sold out and we're unable to remove a body, and disinfect Room 4, in time for check-in.
Okay, every inch of that sentence made me sick.
Moira: I agree with David, we must all move on from this.
- Did I say that?
- Well there's no use wasting time worrying about what happened?
Johnny: We're not worrying about what happened, Moira, we're trying to find a solution, and I'm gonna need the family to help us through this.
Okay, why don't the new guests stay in your room?
It'll take day just to re-box your mother's wigs.
Oh my God, can you imagine?
Not one of you is trained.
Okay, bottom line, we need the room, so throw some things in a bag and we're gonna set you up in our room.
Okay, I've never just thrown some things in a bag before, so you might have to give me a minute.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be sleeping somewhere else.
- Same.
- Like literally anywhere else.
Yeah, like an old tent by the side of the highway.
Okay, enough, let's get going, please?
Yes, yes, plenty of work to be done.
Unfortunately my previous engagements preclude me from offering my beneficence around the motel today.
John, I hate to leave you like this!
Yeah, I know, Moira, you know, busy busy.
- I want the room cleaned up in an hour.
- Okay.
Um, I'm gonna need a roll of dry-cleaning bags, and some padlocks.
Okay, so Roland knows a guy at the coroner's office.
- Wait, you told Roland?
- Yes.
I don't know, I-I ran into him, and he asked me how I was.
- Well, that's not good, Stevie.
- No, I might have panicked.
I wouldn't trust Roland with a set of chopsticks, - let alone a dead body!
- Yeah.
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.
Checking out?
Roland: Hello, Johnny.
Stevie.
I come bearing good news.
Okay, Roland, as you can see, Mr. Rose is checking out a guest right now, so maybe you can hold off on that good news?
Oh sure, I got it.
Uh, well let me just say this, re the toilet that died in Room 4, the plumber will be here in a few hours.
He said he'd be here sooner, but he has another autopsy.
Toilet on the fritz.
Okay, so, what'd the coroner say?
My guys will be here between 4 and 5.
Well, that's not good, we can't have the guests watching a dead body being dragged out of here.
So probably best to keep your guests in their rooms.
And, how're we gonna do that?
Do the rooms lock from the outside?
We're not locking the guests in their rooms, Roland.
Well, I'm sure they'll be fine, Johnny.
I saw a lot of dead bodies when I was a kid,  und I would say that I turned out pretty okay.
-  - Hmm.
- Ted: Thank you very much.
- Man: Bye.
- Alexis!
- Oh my God, Ted, hey!
Um, was there like a pet massacre, or something?
What is with all these sad looking people?
Uh, nope, all these perfectly happy-looking people are actually applying for your old job.
I literally just quit, Ted.
Again, quit implies a negative connotation and I'd say that we had a pretty fun time working together.
We did have a pretty fun time.
That's not what I meant, but anyway, what's up?
Oh, I just wanted to thank you again for coming to my graduation yesterday.
It was a very sweet surprise.
Oh, it was my pleasure.
- Man: Here.
- Oh, thanks.
And, I also had a question.
Uh yeah, Alexis, I'd love to answer that question, it's just I'm kind of right in the middle of interviewing these people, so.
Okay, yeah, totally.
I will just um um I actually used to work here.
This used to be my desk, so.
You know, now that you're here, I guess you could sit in on the interviews with me.
Oh.
Okay, sure.
Now, everybody, just so you know, I got a job here, and I have literally zero interest in animals, so you guys are already like, way ahead.
- Okay.
- So  Have fun!
- Hi.
- Hey.
So, someone's been busy.
Oh yeah, yeah, I've been up since 5.
Could not sleep, been thinking about stuff, you know, last night.
Regrets?
What?
No, why would I have regrets?
I don't know, I think it's a, just a habit to ask.
No, no, no, no.
No regrets.
No, I feel good.
I feel like a weight's been sorta lifted off my shoulders.
It's all very new, you know, and it's a lot to process but Well, here's something fun.
Um what if I stayed at your place tonight?
Huh.
It's just that there's some things happening at the motel, and I Yeah, uh, sorry David, maybe I haven't been clear, I'm gonna need to take this a lot slower than a sleepover tonight.
Oh okay, not like a sleepover sleepover.
I think it's important that I be honest with you about how I'm feeling, because I know you have a lot of experience in this area, - but for me - Oh my God, no, I mean yes, I do, but that's not what I'm implying.
That's Moira: Ding-a-ding.
Patrick: Oh hey, Mrs. Rose.
Um, just takin' this to the back.
We'll talk about this later.
Okay, yeah, it's just some crossed wires.
May I help you?
It's startlingly quiet in here, David.
Is that a good sign?
I thought you were booked up all day, and that's why you couldn't help Dad with the dead b- - that thing in the motel.
- I am booked up, David.
You should see my schedule.
I'm positively bedeviled with meetings, etc.
What are you doing here?
You know what I'd love?
A tea.
We don't sell tea.
Um, you know, I was gonna go make a run to the cafe, - I could get you a tea if you want.
- No, that's not necessary.
How serendipitous.
Thank you, Peter.
- It's Patrick.
- Anything else?
Nothing else for me, thank you, just the scone.
- You mean the tea?
- Why not.
Thank you.
Okay, I was in the middle of like a pretty important conversation, with my business partner, so Sorry David, I had nowhere else to turn.
It's probably nothing, but I think I've killed a man.
I don't know what to do, David.
The last time I felt this emotionally encumbered, I was playing Lady Macbeth on a Crystal Skies cruise ship during Shakespeare at Sea Week.
Okay, well I don't know what to do either, because you still haven't told me what exactly happened.
One tea for you.
One caramel macchiato skim, 2 sweeteners, and a sprinkle of cocoa powder for you.
Thank you.
You're very speedy.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure about the scone, so I got one just to be safe.
There's nothing wrong with treating yourself, dear.
Okay.
Okay, I am pretty sure that he's ready to quit on me, - so can you please - Very well.
How to get started.
Um, I woke up yesterday morning with a spring in my step.
Start later, please.
I could never know where the day was Fast forward it.
I ran into the elderly gentleman outside his room and he asked me for a painkiller.
- And?
- I told him I didn't have one.
- Okay.
- But I did have one.
In fact I had several sample packets in my purse.
I had come from the pharmacy, and they were just out in a bowl.
But I refused the man, and the next thing I know, he turns up dead!
Well, why didn't you just give him the pill?
Because David, because I can barely come to terms with the fact that I've resorted to hoarding sample packets of a basic headache medication, let alone reveal it to the world.
This is what my life has come to, David, killing a man over a complimentary bolus.
Okay, well are you even sure that the pill would have saved his life?
We'll have to let the courts decide.
The courts?
Well, know that you've unloaded this on me, what am I, an accomplice?
David, I came here to be talked off a ledge, not pushed!
Can you imagine this in prison?
Patrick: Can I interject?
I know I wasn't supposed to be listening to this conversation, but it's a small space, and your voice carries so beautifully.
- Mhm.
- Mrs. Rose, I can say with 100% certainty, you have nothing to worry about.
Well that's very kind of you, dear, but now's not the time for well-intended placation.
You're legally prohibited from supplying medication to your guests, so by not giving him anything you've actually avoided any potential liability in his death.
- Well, there we have it then.
- Thank God you're here Pa - trick.
- trick.
You know how David can get carried away, I'm sure.
Oh, I do.
Well, I suppose I'll head back to the scene of the crime, with which I had nothing to do.
Can I ring that up for you?
I paid way too much for a wedge of brie last week, so let's call it even.
I don't think it works like that.
Alexis was right, he's a button.
Thanks.
Well, hello there, my colleague and I are just checking in to see how you're enjoying your stay.
Uh, it is what it is.
Oh, well that's excellent.
Excellent.
Now, will you be heading out this afternoon, - or hanging around the motel?
- Uh, I don't know, I'm just trying to get my kid to take a nap.
He just gets cranky if he doesn't, so Ohhhh, my son's the same way.
Anyway, we just wanted to come by, invite you and your son to our happy hour, happening in the motel lobby between 4 and 5 p.m. You're inviting my son to happy hour?
Well, wrong choice of words.
We prefer to call it a family hour, if that makes you feel any better.
There's gonna be other kids there?
- Oh, I think, - No.
But there is someone staying with us right now who works in a quarry.
So, I bet he has a lot of stories.
And what kind of kid doesn't like rocks?
- Yeah.
- Huh?
Maybe he'll even get to take one home.
Ooh.
- I'm gonna think about it.
- Yeah, it's mandatory.
It's mandatory?
Well again, wrong choice of words, it's not mandatory, but there is a fee for not attending, so you'll be paying for it either way.
What?
Yeah, so we'll just be by a little later to escort you to the lobby.
In the meantime, you can put your son to bed and just make sure he's up and ready to go at 3:55.
- Okay?
Bye for now.
- Bye, thank you.
All right, thank you very much, and we will be in touch.
I have to admit, Alexis, some of your questions were shockingly effective.
I found it very telling how many people would just accept a cocktail from a total stranger.
Hmm, thank you.
Who would've known that Paul was allergic to cats?
- What was he doing here?
- I'm happy to help.
You know it is gonna be different around here without you.
You definitely had a certain something, and I can't quite put my finger on.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you!
So you were gonna ask me something earlier.
Oh, sorry yeah, um, so something gross happened at the motel, so I was actually hoping I could crash at your place tonight.
Yeah, normally that'd be totally okay it's just um, I have a date tonight.
Oh.
Fun.
Okay, um, well maybe I could like drop my stuff - and wait, or - Yeah, it's uh just kinda that um, we may uh, you know, need the apartment at some point.
Apartment at some point.
My God, like for sex.
I don't know why I thought you were single.
That's hmm.
Yeah, I thought I had mentioned her, it's Heather, the woman with the cat.
Yes, the woman who wanted you to wash her cat all the time.
Yeah.
I thought that was like a little casual thing.
It was and then it sort of turned into more of a thing.
Hmm.
Did.
Well, good for Heather.
Thirsty little thing, isn't she.
Um okay, okay, cool.
Well um, I should probably go.
Alexis, wait.
Who would you hire from today?
Um, I liked the guy with the glasses.
Me too.
Um, or the guy with cystic acne.
Either or.
Okay.
Or the girl with the oily braid.
Also very good.
Okay, lots to think about there.
- Mhmm.
- Thank you, Alexis.
So you told your mom about us, huh.
No, I told Alexis about us, and she likely told my mom.
- Okay, listen David - No you listen Sorry that came off way harsher than I wanted it to.
Uh, I know how this looks, especially considering that you just told me you wanted to take things slow, but me wanting to stay at your place, it was more about what was happening at - Yeah, I I know that now.
- Okay.
And I'm sorry for assuming that you just wanted to stay at my house to to sleep with me or whatever.
No, um, it was purely circumstantial, you know, because of the dead body at the Right.
You know, when you kissed me, that, that felt like my first time.
All the things that you're supposed to feel, I-I felt them last night.
Well, if we're being honest with each other, this is sort of like my first time, too.
I mean it's not, I've kissed like a thousand people but nobody that I cared about or respected or thought was nice.
So in a way, it's like we're both starting something new.
Thank you, David.
And hey, for the record, I-I also respect you and think that you're a good person.
Hmm.
It's just I said nice person.
- I know.
- Oh.
I just need you to say nice person.
- You're a good person.
- That's not nice.
Johnny: Well, hello everyone, welcome.
Welcome.
Hope you're enjoying the cinnamon buns and vodka.
We thought it was festive in a Scandinavian sort of way.
Uh, well what a wonderful opportunity for all the guests to uh, get to know each other.
Anyone from out of town?
Well, that makes sense.
- You're all staying at the motel.
-  Um, oh Frank, Frank Frank is here.
Frank who works at a quarry.
Did you bring some rocks in for the kids, Frank?
No, I didn't bring any rocks.
No rocks?
Well.
John, the gentlemen outside need a few more minutes.
Well, I hope the motel has been servicing Well hello, all of you.
Hello, hi.
Isn't this a glittering sea of hopeful faces.
My lovely wife, Moira.
- Man: We wanna go outside.
- Outside.
Well of course you do, who doesn't want to go outside?
But it's also important to cherish what's going on inside.
It's times like these that reminds one of the fact that we're all still alive.
Don't you dare take that for granted.
One day you're asking for an anti-inflammatory, the next day you've passed away in your sleep!
I think we're getting a little off-topic, sweetheart.
The point being, no one knows when we're going to die!
Or be implicated in, and then suddenly cleared of someone else's death.
So, so, drink up!
Go outside!
And live your lives!
And thank you all for spending this hour with us.
I hope you enjoyed the complimentary refreshments.
Okay, people, let's leave the cups inside.
We're not in Vegas, here.
Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Alexis: Okay, so I'm thinking like, Season five Carrie Bradshaw, like, super professional and polished, but also like, chill and flirty in an impossibly expensive sort of way.
You do know that this is your first day at Elmdale College, and not Vogue, right?
Hush, David, because Jocelyn said that only her top students go to Elmdale.
Okay, I think that says more about Jocelyn as a teacher than it does her students.
Kids, it's garbage day.
Oh good, ours is full.
Okay, I've told you both a thousand times, tie up the bags and leave them outside your door!
Okay, but I like, just put something in it that made it full, though.
Yeah, and you're already wearing your little gloves, though.
Okay, do me a favour, David, and don't mention this to dad, 'cause I haven't chosen my courses yet, and if he finds out he's just gonna like, buzz around until I ask him his opinion.
And no offense to him, but I don't want it.
This is the same college where Malala gave that devastating commencement speech, right?
I don't know, David, maybe he did.
Anyway, I have a lot of big changes happening in my life right now, so I'd appreciate it if you were a little bit more onside.
Okay.
- Where'd Alexis go?
- She went for a run, apparently there are some really big changes happening in her life right now.
Yeah, I should say so.
Why are you waving a thermometer in my face?
- It's a pregnancy test.
- Ewww!
What?
!
Well, it's a smiley face, so I'm assuming it's a positive result.
Well, that's presumptuous.
Are we a 100% sure it's hers?
Well, this test is a 100% sure it's someone's!
Oh, are you serious?
I was ready to stop after one!
Come to think of it, she has been very up and down lately, but I've been just chalking that up to the fact that her personal life is like a steaming pile of - Someone needs to talk to her!
- Well, don't look at me, I'm pretty sure she already knows it's a mistake!
No, I'll talk to her.
Yes, I'll tell her she has no right to lay this financial and psychological burden on us!
Well, maybe I'll talk to her Now she has to move into one of those homes - for unwed mothers!
- Oh my God, imagine?
Moira, that's not gonna happen.
Oh, I'm sure there are plenty of them on this side of the tracks.
Let the nuns take care of the little stranger!
What Alexis needs now is to feel supported by her family!
- Hah!
- Okay.
Um, I'm just gonna say it, I am not in a place right now to be emotionally available to a baby.
You know I'm a little disappointed in you, David, you spend a lot of time with Alexis, you could've done a better job looking out for her!
Okay, I'm sorry I'm not a condom.
Aaaah!
I always knew this would happen!
Oh, God help us all.
Okay, I just think I'm in a state of shock right now, you know, the news was very numbing, and I'm feeling very alone.
Mhmm.
Mm!
Imagine how Alexis must feel.
Yeah, I haven't spoken to her.
Huh.
Remind what this is again?
That is a eucalyptus under eye serum.
Mhmm and remind me why you can't apply it to yourself?
Because it requires a steady hand, and I'm going through a lot right now.
- Right -  Hi, I was looking for some uh Yeah, we don't sell that.
- Bath salts?
- We actually do sell those.
They're on the middle shelf, just over there.
I'll be over to help you in a second.
Okay, between Alexis getting knocked up, and us not having enough privacy to connect, I'm feeling very shaken.
Do you think you're gonna make it, though?
Unclear.
Unclear on whether I'm gonna make it through or not.
Hang in there.
Moira: Jocelyn, oh, I seem to have left my sunglasses behind, you haven't discovered them amidst your cleaning, have you?
You mean, the ones on top of your head?
- And there they are.
-  And I'm off, then.
Moira, is everything all right?
You seem a little distracted today.
No, I'm-I'm just a little distracted today.
I'm having one of those days myself.
We're in the midst of a family crisis, if you must know!
- Well, I don't wanna pry, so - Well, you've cracked me open.
- Alexis is pregnant.
- What?
I know!
We discovered the test in her bathroom today.
- You did?
- And to think when I awoke, my biggest concern was how to make that ragtime medley of yours work.
Uh huh It's just flagrant irresponsibility!
To allow an unscheduled conception to occur!
- Moira?
- Oh, she has no idea of the toll a baby can take on its mother, or its mother's mother.
Moira, I'm the one who's pregnant.
- If only.
- It's true.
I was dropping off Alexis' course book, and I had gotten the test from the pharmacy, and I was so anxious to find out, that I took the test in Alexis' bathroom.
Oh Jocelyn, oh Jocelyn!
Oh, what a wonderful surprise for us all!
Oh!
I know.
I thought it was menopause that was making me late, and giving me the cravings, and morning sickness.
I wouldn't know.
Listen, can you do me a favour, and just keep this between the two of us, because Roland doesn't know yet.
Oh!
Oh Jocelyn, Roland's not the father?
Of course he is, I just haven't found the right time to tell him.
Don't wait, best to rip it off like a band aid.
You're probably right.
It's just that we weren't expecting this.
One must prepare for any event.
Miracles don't take reservations.
Ahhh!
Oh   Oh, hi, honey.
My God, how long have you been sitting there?
Oh, I didn't realize it took you so long to put your makeup on.
Can I help you with something?
Just wondering how you're feeling.
Fine, a little nervous.
Well, that's understandable, comes with the territory.
Uh it might help if we chat about it.
Um no, I don't want to chat about it.
I'm late.
Well, I know you're late, sweetheart.
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew you were gonna get way too involved in this.
David has already given me a hard time.
I know, and believe me, I will be talking to David about that.
Now Ted, is he being supportive?
- I haven't even told Ted.
- Oh.
I just wanna do one thing on my own!
And you're sure this is the right one thing to pick?
Okay, please don't stress me out about this!
This is supposed to be fun!
And it will be fun, honey, it will be, in time.
You know, it will also be a lot of work.
I know that!
And not to mention, a lot of money.
Why do you think I've been saving up my money from the vet's office?
How long have you known about this?
Oh my God, you are being so extra right now!
- I have to go!
- Okay, clearly this is not a good time, but I just want you to know your mother and I are here, whenever you feel comfortable enough to talk, although I'd suggest talking to me, and not your mother.
You are making way too big a deal of this.
If I don't like it, I'll just give it up, and move on!
Okay?
Ding, ding!
Ahem.
Hi.
We're actually closed today.
It's one o'clock on a Friday.
Okay, is there something I can help you with?
Do you give all your customers this kind of VIP treatment?
Actually, I do, and I would love to keep chatting, it's just that Patrick and I were working on fixing a uh a light bulb in the back, so we oh, hey.
- Hey, Stevie.
- Hi.
David and I were just in the back doing some inventory.
- Yeah.
- Hmm, yeah.
Seems like you guys are really busy - at work.
- Uh - Ooh, what's that?
- What's what?
You got a little red um is that a bug bite?
Or a little mouth shaped sunburn?
Looks like a hickey, actually.
But it's not, it's not a It's not a hickey, right?
Because that would be disgusting, and wildly unprofessional.
David, did you give me a hickey?
!
Okay no, I didn't, I gave you a-a half hickey, because we haven't had the time or the privacy for me to give you a full hickey!
If you give me $50 bucks I'll stand outside, and tell people you're on lunch.
I'll give you 50 cents to stand outside - and never come back!
- You see, this is why we can't do this here.
- Desperate times, huh?
- No, trying times, Nothing about this is desperate.
It's just that there's a lot of people at the motel, and Patrick is renting a room from Ray.
- Who really likes to chat.
- Yeah.
So there has literally been zero privacy.
Well, if you want, I'm happy to offer you guys my apartment for the night.
Why?
Why would you do that?
Because I care about you two.
Okay, and where will you be?
Well, if you must know, work's been really stressful, so I'm going to take a little me time at a spa in Elmdale.
That is super generous, but wouldn't be a little bit weird us having alone time at your place?
Especially because you guys have - Oh God no!
No, we've never - No, never, ew!
- We've never done that there.
- Never.
I still live there.
I mean, we could consider it.
What exactly is the catch?
No catch.
- David!
- What?
- We'll take the place.
- Okay, we'll take the place.
Great, and I'll take this.
So there's a bit of a catch.
- You know, Moira, it's not as bad as I thought.
- Mmm If David sells the store, and uh and you get some part time work, and we get a good price for the car, I think we can make it through the first two years easy, and then we just have to figure out preschool.
John, as much as I appreciate your budgetary prowess, it turns out there is no immediate need for concern.
Well, now we're all taking this a little too lightly.
Alexis isn't the one who's pregnant.
Someone else is, but don't press me for details, because I've been sworn to secrecy.
- You've been sworn - It's Jocelyn!
But you're not supposed to know.
She hasn't told Roland yet.
- Jocelyn!
- Huh?
She was appropriately gobsmacked herself.
And I must say, I am entirely relieved.
Yeah, that's it's not Alexis!
But save that spreadsheet, John, and you might want to add a line item for prophylactics.
- Tomorrow's another day.
- Yeah, well, don't worry, I've already had a serious talk with Alexis, though now I'm wondering what exactly we were talking about.
Um, hey, excuse me, Um, I'm looking for the registrar's office.
It's in there.
Okay, I'm just like, a little bit confused, because on the brochure it looks like it's in a moss covered building by the lake.
So I'm guessing the quad is just like, on the other side of the building?
The office is in there, make a right.
A 100%.
Ooh  - Okay, hi.
Hi!
- Hmm, what's up?
I am what this brochure calls a prospective student.
Cool, so you're not enrolled yet?
No, I am enrolled, um, prospectively.
I was wondering if there's like, a campus tour, - or something?
- Wow well, it wouldn't be much of a tour, but yeah, I guess I could walk you back up the hall, if you want.
Okay, it's just that this brochure is like, a little bit confusing.
Yeah, we couldn't afford in house photography, so we just used stock images.
See?
Watermark there.
This is actually a still from "Dead Poets Society".
I feel like that's false advertising, especially considering what I am paying for these courses.
Yeah, but you get free coffee and doughnuts.
Oh, and like, um, an agenda.
-  - Yeah, it's off by a day.
So I wouldn't use it.
Okay great, I would like a refund, please.
Uh, the problem is, is we don't give refunds.
Okay, then I guess I would just like my money back, then.
- Again, we don't give refunds.
- Okay, okay.
This is the first time that I've ever invested in anything myself, and I thought that was like, the responsible choice, but clearly, this is like, a joke school.
Well, that's why most students do their courses online.
Oh.
So like, potentially, I could refund my refund request, do all my courses online, and like, never have to ever come back here again?
That's actually how I keep my side hustle going, part time DJ.
Here's my card, in case you have any problems, or you wanna go on a date, or something.
Okay.
Well, I won't be doing any of that, but thank you so much.
Ooh!
Please, come in, come in.
- Ooh.
- Welcome.
Make yourselves at home.
Just so you know, there's nothing in the fridge.
Oh, and I marked the booze, so I'll know if you touch it.
I noticed the line is a couple inches above where the whiskey starts.
I am stunned by your generosity.
Um, where exactly are you going tonight?
Out to a spa.
Which she already told us, so maybe just say thank you.
Oh no, I did, I did say thank you multiple times.
Um, what is the name of the spa?
David!
Let's just let her go, okay?
- Okay, yeah.
-  - Are we expecting company, or?
- N-no, I wasn't!
Hey, pony!
Are you ready to go?
What are you doing?
I said I would meet you outside!
I said I'd help you with your bags.
David.
Wow, it's been a while.
- Pony.
- Hey - Mm-mmm!
Ahem!
- Wow, you look good.
Who's this guy?
- This is my that's - Patrick.
- That's Patrick.
- And you are?
- Picking up Stevie.
- Yeah, we're gonna go, so So I'm not getting a name, then.
Um, so you and "pony," what do you have planned for tonight?
Well, it's date night, so we thought maybe we'd spend it in the woods.
Yeah, just galloping around the woods, huh?
Yeah, with your "pony".
Not at a spa.
So - I take it you two are still - Seeing each other, yes.
As it turns out we are.
After we all broke up, Stevie came over to end things officially, - and it just didn't stick, so.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
No, it didn't stick, did it.
Now, when you say "we all broke up " So you offering your apartment had nothing to do with any guilt you felt about harboring a little secret?
Nope.
Just trying to be a good person, so.
We're gonna go, leave you two lovebirds.
Unless you two wanna come?
Nope!
I don't think so.
- Come on.
- You do you.
Good to meet you, man.
So we're gonna talk about this, right?
Yep, I'm just gonna grab that bottle of - Whiskey?
Yeah.
- Yeah, the whiskey.
So Roland, you're probably wondering why I'm taking you out for tacos tonight.
Well honey, you don't need a special reason for taco night.
No, but there is a special reason tonight.
There's something that I wanted to talk to you about, something exciting.
Oh, hold that thought, honey.
Hey, Johnny, Moira, Jocelyn's just about to tell me something exciting, come and join us.
Oh, no, no, no, far be it for us to intrude.
No, I think it's best that Jocelyn share this life altering news, whatever it may be, - on her own.
- Yeah.
And we'll probably take another table, because I skipped lunch and you know me when I'm hungry.
Look out!
Uh, we'll sit over here.
Johnny, I am not gonna ask again.
No, no, no.
No, in fact I am gonna ask again.
- And again.
And again.
- Roland - Get over here, and sit yourself down!
It's okay Moira, take a seat.
Okay, okay well, John and I will just study the menu, - as they keep making amendments.
- Yeah  Hmm So Roland, you might have noticed that I've been on a real Dorito casserole kick lately, and there's a reason for that.
Besides wanting to keep me as your husband?
Am I right, Johnny?
Oh, I need to be a part of this.
The last time I made that casserole was when I was pregnant with Mutt.
And I've really been craving that casserole again.
Yeah.
Well, that's understandable, honey, I mean, it's a terrific casserole.
I'd kill for a casserole right now.
Rollie, how are you not getting this?
- Have we decided?
- I'm pregnant!
-  - We're having a baby.
- Oh my goodness!
- Yeah, Twyla, I'm gonna have the bottomless French Onion soup, and maybe you might wanna drop a little calamari on the table.
- John!
- Yes!
Oh, oh, pregnant?
Wow!
Wonderful news.
Hey, congratulations, fella.
Yes, we are stunned!
Honey are you okay?
Okay?
Of course I'm okay!
Oh my God!
We're having a baby!
Champagne for everybody, on me!
- I can't drink, Rollie.
- Oh right, you're driving.
Uh you know what Twyla, actually, let's just do one beer, one beer for me.
Okay?
Congratulations, you two.
Well, I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart, that I couldn't be happier that this is happening to you and your family!
So this is for you.
Um cheers to privacy.
Sorry, I've just gotta go through that one more time.
So you dated Jake and then Stevie dated Jake.
Mhmm mhmm.
And at one point, you all No, see, that's where you're wrong.
- We almost all, but I said no.
- Ah.
Because Stevie and I agreed that that would be a bad idea, but it appears that I'm the only one that held up my end of that agreement.
And you're upset about this because you still No!
I'm not upset!
- I-I don't want any of that!
- No It's a principle thing.
And we are getting sidetracked right now.
Okay?
So who is feeling sexy?
Getting there for sure, I just-you know, I I knew you had a rich dating history, David, I just didn't expect to be graced by the presence of two of your exes tonight.
Yeah, funny thing, neither did I. So - But - Mhmm?
Given that we only have the apartment for one night.
- Mmm.
- Maybe it's best if we lock that box back up for now?
- I think that's a good idea.
- Mhmm.
Mhmm.
You know what, we didn't even get into your history - Lock it up, David.
Lock it up.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, so I've been thinking about what you said, and it is a big expense, but I think I can find a way to make it work.
What's happening?
Dad's trying to get me to drop out of college.
No, that's not what was happening!
I-I thought we were talking about something else.
What else?
Oh, he thought you were pregnant.
- What?
Ew!
- Well, we all did.
Oh my God, that's so mean!
Oh, look who's here.
Where were you all night?
Um out-side.
I was outside.
A little past curfew.
Oh burn, David.
I'm sorry, I was processing Alexis' situation.
- David, Alexis isn't - No, it's okay.
I mean, have your fun now David, because when the twins arrive, I'm gonna really need your help.
Um, that's a hard pass.
You're gonna be so involved in their lives.
Mm, your body, your problem.
David, Alexis isn't pregnant.
Okay, but just picture them as like, tiny little roommates, whose tiny little poops you get to clean up!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Jocelyn: Moira, I'm sorry I couldn't be more available for you today, it's just that my sister was supposed to organize this with me, and her husband has come down with gout for the third time.
But I still think this is gonna be the best - Asbestos Fest yet!
- You know, I know all about being left in the lurch for a fundraiser.
Eva Longoria and I were supposed to perform our ventriloquist act for the "Everybody Nose" benefit for juvenile rhinoplasty, when she suddenly drops out due to exhaustion.
I had to be both puppet, and puppeteer.
Okay, you know what, Moira?
There's just a lot going on right now.
I've got a list of three different numbers that you're choosing from, and what would really be helpful to everyone, and when I say everyone, I mean me, is if you could just nail down which one you're gonna perform tonight.
I did get the set list from the children's choir two weeks ago.
I the easiest to go with is probably "Shoes, Glorious Shoes, the Imelda Marcos Story".
- Okay.
- Never mind.
I am going to dust off "Two Heads are Better".
The one woman Siamese twin play.
Yes-no!
No, you know what?
I am going to resurrect "One Crazy Summer, The Patty Hearst Story".
It's a tale of perseverance, much like your quest to bring asbestos back to the town.
Okay, well first of all, we're trying to get rid of the asbestos, Moira, and we really just need you to make a decision, now.
- Okay!
- Now!
Well, let me think!
Uh "Two Heads" it is.
The Foxwood Casino Gazette did say it was a performance they'd never seen before.
- Don't write that down.
- Okay Moira, I just wanna slap you right across the face.
Patty it is!
Patty.
Although Jocelyn, I'm wondering, does "TV's Moira Rose" send a different message than "television's Moira Rose"?
Something to think about?
I said, something to think about!
Hello, you.
- Oh hi, David.
- Hi.
I believe you said I could have your room for the day, to rehearse my act for the fundraiser.
Oh, you meant like, like right now?
Okay.
Um what did you decide on?
Well, at this very moment it's 1974, and this room is a San Franciscan bank.
You're going with the Patty Hearst story?
Yes, I am.
And what's wrong with that?
Well, didn't it have an ensemble cast of 30?
Uh huh, and what was your father's review?
29 dead weights!
So I trimmed the fat.
You didn't even play Patty, though.
You know I did!
The night Patricia Lupone ate that pre-show shwarma, and I was asked to step in.
I've always wanted to reprise the role!
I just recall that that show was very heavy on the footwork and at one point you yelled, "Line"!
in the middle of a dance break.
Okay, some of these townspeople are going to experience my triad of threats for the first time, David.
Nothing less than spectacular can do for them!
Okay.
I just remember you practicing every day for seven months with that dance instructor that I ended up dating.
Are you sure you remember it all?
Skip Fosse once told me that when it comes to choreo, always leave some room for spontaneity.
- Okay.
- Okay, you know what?
If you feel it's necessary, fine, I won't stand in the way of you spotting.
Well unfortunately, I can't spot you now, because now I have to go to work.
- Oh, then go to work!
- Okay.
Good luck.
No, you say, "break a leg".
- Okay, that, too.
- Say "break a leg"!
- Break a leg!
-  Okay, here.
Ahem!
We're going to ease in with a machine gun ballet.
- Hi, sorry.
- Boys: Hey!
This guy!
- Excuse me, hey.
- Hey, yeah.
- What's up.
Yeah And we mark up the retail price.
- Okay.
- What are you doing here?
Patrick has offered to help me with this school assignment - I told you that, David.
- Hey.
Um, you did not tell me that.
Yeah, how are your friends doing outside?
- They're harmless, thanks.
- Are they?
Cool.
Um, we're actually just in the middle of something, - so if you wouldn't mind - I would mind, but - Okay, so, profit margins.
- Mhmm?
Um, how do you get more of those?
Well, you'd start by telling the group of teens that hang out outside your store every afternoon to leave because they're scaring off actual customers.
Okay, they're not scaring off customers, there was one that looked meth-y.
And I don't know where he went.
See, your brother doesn't wanna tell them off.
Which is, and you can write this down, - a financial liability.
- Liability.
Incorrect!
The fact that we have youths minding their own business in front of our store builds, and you can write this down - No.
- Street cred.
Okay, are they actually buying anything?
Yes!
They're coming in, and they're buying gum.
And what else are they doing, David?
They're coming in, they're looking around, and they're buying gum.
And maybe complimenting my outfits.
- There it is!
- No, there what is?
I'm sorry that you connect with a more mature clientele, whereas I vibe with a much younger crowd.
- Oh.
-  - Nice sweater, bro!
- Um God, I This is so old, and I can't even remember where I got it.
Do you guys remember-sorry, where I got this sweater?
- What just happened to you?
- Huh?
Like, breathe it out.
Roland: Hey there, Johnny!
Just so you know, I'm obviously a beer guy, but I've never been known to turn down a fresh bouquet of flowers Roland, what are you talking about?
Well, you are gonna be thanking me pretty soon for saving your bacon, so I just thought - I'd give you some gift ideas.
- I'm kinda busy right now.
Yeah, I can see that.
Very busy, right, Johnny?
Apparently too busy to change the bulb that's burned out over room three.
Roland, I fail to see how pointing out problems here is saving my bacon.
I know a guy who needs some work, and I told him I'd do him a favour, and get him a job right here in the motel, so Uh huh.
And why does it sound like I'd be the one doing your friend the favour?
Well Johnny, I'm the middle man, I'm the one that kind of made this all happen.
Well, nothing's happened, so you can tell your friend - we can't afford him.
-  You know, when I started Rose Video we had one employee per store working start to close, so keeping an eye on the bottom line, that's how a young business grows.
- Uh huh - Besides, Stevie and I are managing just fine on our own.
All I'm saying is keep an open mind, okay?
It might be nice to have a guy around here who has some basic skills for a change.
And I'm sorry, but we all know how Rose Video turned out!
You know, Rose Video was the second largest video chain in- -  - Oohhh!
Did you ask him why he's been wandering around with a notepad, it's really starting to creep out the guests.
Yeah, he's pitching a guy he knows to help out around the motel, but don't worry, I told him that we're a well oiled machine at this point.
Yeah, that I've been greasing.
Your new policy about helping the guests with the bags Yeah, and you know, we're getting very good feedback about that on the comment cards.
But I've been the one carrying them, because "somebody" has a bad back.
Well Stevie, if I lift a roll of toilet paper, you know, it flares up.
Okay well, I'm starting to look like a Slovakian shot putter, so I'm with Roland.
We're gonna be hiring someone else.
Thanks, bro.
Come back again soon, guys.
Great sale, bro.
Four teens, one pack of gum, which you gift wrapped.
Hey, why don't we just close the store up, and celebrate for the rest of the day?
I'll have you know that it was one pack of gum, - and one lip balm.
- Oh!
Well, that'll make up for all the stuff they've been stealing.
- I'm sorry?
- What do you mean, stealing?
Those kids are one hundred percent stealing from you.
- I don't think so.
-  Okay.
They split up into four different directions, one takes the back left corner, one takes the right, one of them asks you if you have those wool hoodies in a different size, while the last one compliments you on your cuticle game.
And while you're lapping all that up, the two in the back corner are filling their backpacks full of facial cleanser.
It's the exact same move that I used with my klepto friends in the Hamptons.
I-I feel like I would've sent that.
Yeah, I mean, maybe that's what you and your burnout friends did at the Miss Sixty store, but that's not what's happening here.
Okay.
Why don't you go check, then?
I can't tell if there's product missing, or if we just haven't replenished.
I feel like if someone were robbing our store - we would know about it, right?
- Uh yeah, we would know.
Though this would explain the compliments.
- That's - What?
Give it an hour, they'll be back.
They only took the toner and the cleanser, and if they're not selling it on the black market, then they'll need to come back and get the moisturizer, or their t-zones are going to be like, super effed!
Roland: Johnny, I gotta say, uh, I'm glad you came around to your senses, and may I tell you something, I don't feel like you're less of a man because you need a little help with your business.
Yeah, that's good to know, Roland.
So where's the guy?
Oh he'll be here, don't you worry.
Mr. Worry!
And I think you're really going to like him, he's very smart, he's devilishly handsome, and he stands about yay tall, maybe a little bit more like that.
Okay, I see where this is going.
- Or do you?
- Roland, what are we doing here?
Johnny, it's me!
I'm the guy!
I know you're the guy, I got that as soon as I said where's the guy?
Oh my god, you should see the look on your face!
Impatience, that's the look!
All right, we do need help at the motel, we do need someone, but someone who is going to pitch in, and do some of the grunt work.
And I am willing to roll up my sleeves, and help out my best friend!
Okay, I gotta go.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no!
Now I wasn't joking about my skills, pal!
Come on, what do you say we give it a shot?
- I don't think so, no.
- Huh?
Going once.
- Going twice.
- No.
- Going 3 times.
- Roland!
All right.
Going 4 times.
Going 5 times All right, all right, all right.
All right.
Fine.
But only because we could actually use some help.
- That's a smart move, Johnny.
- But consider this a trial.
Yeah, that's probably a good idea, I don't wanna commit until I know I like it.
Stick 'em up.
It's a hold up.
Nobody move but me-me-me-me!
But me!
-  - Who goes there?
- It's Jocelyn.
- Oh!
Good news, Moira, don't ask me why, but Gwen had a hunting rifle in her basement, and I'm hoping this is good for your act!
Um, it was a machine gun.
So I need a machine gun for the machine gun ballet!
Okay Moira, you've got to meet me halfway here, - this is a real gun!
- What?
And I got you extra performance time, I got the children's choir down to one song!
Some of the kids cried.
Oh, Jocelyn.
Jocelyn, why?
Why, why, why, would you do that?
Because you asked for more time, Moira!
But Jocelyn!
Did you know that rehearsal, it can be the most enlightening and even heuristic exercise.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I am stepping out of the limelight, Jocelyn.
But we already re-printed the posters from "TV's Moira Rose," to "Television's Moira Rose"!
And that's great, that will get them in the door and then the kids take over from there!
- That's - Okay.
I see what's going on here.
- Somebody's got cold feet.
- Ha ha.
Blocks of ice.
Mhmm.
I bit off more than I could chew.
You know what, Moira, we have all been there.
Yeah.
On my wedding day, I thought, what if I just got in my car and drove to New Mexico, and left Roland at the altar at the Elmdale Bingo Hall?
Bottom line, I got cold feet too, and I faced my fears, and now look at us!
27 years of bliss.
Was I to perceive something encouraging within that little anecdote?
Okay, you know what, Moira, pull it together.
I'm taking this gun.
- Okay, Patty, come on, Patty!
-  Patty, the eyes of the lonely world are on you!
So, five, six, seven, eight, Patty!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Nine, ten-nine Nine, ten, eleven, twelve!
-  - Like clockwork, David.
- Hey!
- Yeah.
Hey!
Can I help you guys with anything, or ?
No, we're just looking.
Okay, cool.
Cool, cool, yeah, yeah.
Look around.
You do you.
Uh, hey, do you have this in like, a larger size, maybe?
I don't know, I'll have to go all the way into the back to check.
- Hey, man!
-  I like your shoes, where'd you get them?
- Oh!
Oh - Oh!
Um, these?
I got these at a boutique in Prague that's only open on Sunday nights.
- Cool.
- Is it?
Uh hey, I think we're gonna head.
Oh, um wait, but-you forgot something, though.
What?
!
Look, please don't do anything crazy, it took me so long to make that.
Well, I'll be happy to give it back, when you and your skid mark friends give back all of the products that you've stolen.
And if I'm being honest, someone with your combination of skin should really be using product with tea tree oil in it.
I Hand it over.
I thought she was too cool to work here.
I don't work here, and I am really cool, so.
Don't do it again, and I won't call the Po Po.
- Did she say Po Po?
- Okay!
Okay!
I think we're done here.
Okay, I just have one more question.
All those compliments, and fist pumps - Bumps.
- Shut up.
Was that just part of the big scheme?
- No, you have cool style.
- I like your shoes.
They're lying to you, David, they're lying, they're lying.
Okay, get out.
Right, so  - Ugh - What?
Why me?
- I just feel really gross.
- Why did I get one?
Okay, so there's window repair in room four.
Mhmm And then the bathroom in room 5 still needs to be done.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can you handle that?
- No, I am just waiting to hear something that's in my wheelhouse.
Okay uh, why don't you just start by changing the sheets?
Honey, that kinda sounds like a Johnny job to me.
Why don't we just put a "J" next to that.
No, no, no!
We're putting an "R" next to that, Roland, I thought you said you had no problem doing grunt work.
Well Johnny, how's it going to look to have the mayor of the town changing sheets?
Uh, we change sheets!
Well great, so then, you've got it covered, let's put a big, fat "J" next to that one.
No, no, we're not putting a "J," we're putting an "R"!
Or better yet, Roland, why not just get to work?
This isn't exactly what I had in mind - when I said I needed help.
- Yeah, I know.
No, guys, look, I just need to find something that caters to my expertise.
That's all, you know what I can do?
I can restock the soda machine.
Yeah, the soda machines are fine, Roland.
What would actually help is if you could clean a toilet or two, but obviously, you're too good for that.
- No, I can clean a toilet.
- You know what, - I think we made a mistake, Stevie.
- Mhmm.
- No!
I wanna clean a toilet.
- We'll hire somebody else.
No, I need to clean a toilet!
You need to clean a toilet?
Yeah, I need to Johnny, I I mean, with the new baby coming, things are a little tight.
Joc and I have been trying to save, but we've been living off cold cuts and waffles.
And Jocelyn had to sell her Beanie Baby collection.
And she didn't get half what that Diana bear was worth.
And now she's working nights down at the gas station.
- She's working nights?
- No, she's not, but she will have to if things get really bad.
All right.
- Here's what we're gonna do.
- Hmm?
We're putting an "R" beside every single thing on this list.
Got it.
Okay.
Now when you say "R," does that stand for Rose, as in Johnny Rose - Roland!
It stands for Roland!
- Okay.
And you can start by taking those sheets over to room two.
You got it.
Ew!
What are you doing in my bed?
Oh, David please, I couldn't possibly make it all the way to my own bed.
I'm-I'm just uh - I'm exhausted!
-  - Was it the footwork?
- Oh, it was the footwork.
It was the score, it was the book, it was all of that, David.
But most severely lacking was me.
You were right, my dear.
I've had my time, and it's over now.
Um, I don't think I said that.
There is an elephant in the room David, and he's whispering, "retire"!
Run David, go to Jocelyn, and tell her to cancel the evening.
Okay um well, I won't be doing that, but  there is one other option.
What?
What if we did the number?
- The number?
- Yeah, I know, it was stupid, it was dumb.
It was a dumb idea.
David, you would do that for me?
I thought you used to hate it when I'd trot you out in front of my friends?
I still do, it's just that I'm finding this situation to be incredibly disturbing, and I will eventually need my bed back.
Do you think people would find it strange, - or even inappropriate?
- Probably.
And do you think we still have it?
I'll go plug in my hair straightener.
I hope you're not wearing your shoes.
Okay, let's have another round of applause for the children's choir, and their Kylie Minogue medley!
Those were some racy lyrics!
Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that your headliner tonight is gonna surprise you, because she certainly surprised me when she told me just moments ago that she'd switched up her entire act, even though somebody put down a really hefty deposit on a wall of mirrors!
Okay anyways, without further ado, the main event!
Oh, thank you so much.
Um, is this the number?
It's the middle of summer.
Brr!
It's awfully cold out there.
Um, they used to do this act every year at our Christmas party, and you can't unsee something like this.
- Ahem!
-  Oh, I wonder who that could be!
It's television's Moira Rose!
That's television's mom, to you.
You know, nothing is colder than the chill I get when I think of the dangers of asbestos poisoning.
Mhmm.
Luckily, a little birdie told me that with enough funds raised, this town could be asbestos free by -  - Christmas!
- Ding!
- Dong!
- Ding!
- Dong!
- Ding!
- Dong!
- Ding!
- Dong!
Both: On the first day of Christmas, My true love gave to me, The keys to a Lamborghini - On the - Oh come all ye faithful Deck the halls with boughs of holly Yes, I said faithful, which rules out all of you!
Both: God rest ye, merry gentlemen Let nothing you dismay may-may-may
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 Moira: David?
My nails aren't dry yet.
Alexis, I stumbled upon Ted in the cafÃ© this morning, he sends his regards.
That's nice.
Um, what did he say?
Nothing, we merely exchanged familial smiles.
He seemed quite taken with an older woman, so I thought best not to intrude.
Love that for him.
I mean, that could've been anyone though, right, like a mother, or a close friend?
They were canoodling in the banquette for all to see, so I'd be rather concerned if that were his mother, David.
Okay.
Um, in other news, I recently discovered that I'm allergic to pitted fruits.
- Canoodling?
- Oh.
Um did she have like a braid in her hair?
No, no braid.
Uh, looked more like thick, healthy hair woven together loosely.
I can't believe he's still dating Heather.
I know, it's crazy.
I believe that was her name, Heather.
Okay, do we have somewhere to be?
Alexis, he doesn't still hold any interest for you?
No, it's not as if you've been spending all your time holed up in your room, alone.
Yeah, no, I'm just like taking time for me.
- Mhmm.
- Good!
That's the most important relationship of all.
Don't you give another thought to Ted - and his striking older lover.
- Okay, I am going for a jog.
Ok, um, but you're in like a day dress.
- Mhmm, I am.
-  Okay, I have never heard someone say so many wrong things, one after the other, consecutively, in a row.
David!
How was I to know that Ted would be such a trigger, all these years later?
A year later, and she is like right back in it.
So you might wanna pay a little more attention to your daughter's life, if only to alleviate the weight of me having to deal with it, every day.
Oh.
I I did call that other woman charming, didn't I?
Striking, I believe was the word you used to describe Ted's new girlfriend, who isn't Alexis.
Well to my credit, she was.
Roland, you're here early.
I've decided it's time I become a team player.
Well, that's good!
And as coach of the team, I'm gonna ask you to take your feet off my desk.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, Johnny, I love all this water cooler talk, but let's get down to business.
I was lookin' around this place, and boom, it hit me!
There's a lotta wasted space in here.
I mean this should be an area for guests to come and mix and mingle.
Well, I don't think I like the thought of guests mingling in my office.
That's what their rooms are for.
Ah, but, do the rooms have a     beer fridge?
- Where did this come from?
- I brought it over this morning.
Joce wanted a little extra space for the new baby, and I thought why not help out a buddy in the process?
And how's this helping me?
Well, you can sell beers to the guests, Johnny, unless of course you're trying not to make money, which would explain a couple of things here.
Well of course I'm tryin' to make money.
Johnny, if it makes any difference to you, I've already sold 2 beers to a fellow staff member.
Would that staff member be you?
Yes, it would.
I'm gonna have 'em after lunch.
Now the big question is where to put the TV?
- What TV?
- Well, Johnny, you can't expect guests to sit around with their beers staring at you.
Oh God you knock me out, kid.
Okay, you know what, your job here is not CEO, Roland, you were hired to do some work around the motel.
So I'm gonna say no to the TV.
Okay, Johnny, I hear ya loud and clear.
Geez.
Off to work.
Patrick: I cursed those bears with the little strength - that I could muster up.
-  Hi!
We're all just hanging out before work?
Was there a text chain that I wasn't on, or ?
Well, it's not exactly before work the store opened about 25 minutes ago, so.
But yes, there is a chain, and no, you're not on it.
You're kind.
I noticed we moved the lip balms.
Yeah, because we got these new breath mints in and I wanted to give 'em a fighting chance by putting 'em up near the cash.
- Huh.
- Uh oh.
What, is something wrong?
No, they're just new mints that haven't been sampled yet, so for all we know, they could be poison, and we're moving the lip balms, best sellers, all the way to the corner, here.
Okay, well I don't think that the mints are poison.
They're very delicious.
Point is, these are a staple of the store.
They're at the cash, people come to the cash - expecting the lip balm.
- Mhmm.
I just wish they had been consulted before they were moved.
David you move things without consulting me all the time.
Like the brooms!
Okay, well they were fugly brooms with big red handles.
They didn't match our sand and stone color palette.
Well, this is clearly a high stakes situation, so maybe you wanna close the store down and figure it out.
You know, David, one of the fundamental pillars of any successful business person is their ability to compromise.
Hm, I have to agree with Patrick on this one.
I don't think there's anything you have to do, and I compromise all the time.
- What?
- Nothing, I just um, just remembering all those times that you compromised.
I was just thinking about the same things, because there, there's so many to flip through.
Okay, last week, I let you pick the movie we watched.
You made me pick between two Sandra Bullock vehicles.
And you picked "The Lake House", which was the correct choice.
Just so that you know, making someone choose between two things that you like, is not exactly a compromise.
I am fine with compromise.
It's just this situation that's bothering me.
So why don't we just put everything back exactly - as it was, and start again?
- So in that case, I know that you were planning to go pick up the tote bags later this afternoon, even though I'd asked you do to that 2 days ago, so maybe in the interest of compromise, you could go and do that now?
Fine.
Stevie, would you care to join me?
- No.
- Fair enough.
So you guys are just gonna stay behind and talk about me after I've left.
You know, swap stories about how I don't compromise.
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Mhmm.
Twyla: Here's your tea, Mrs. Rose.
Thank you, Twyla.
So, it looks like I will be seeing you tonight.
Why would that happen?
Well, Alexis came by this morning and was really adamant that we go out tonight.
Apparently I've been taking too much time for myself, and I need to get back out there and meet people.
Is that so?
Yeah, I actually had plans tonight, but Alexis said it would be best if I just canceled them.
She's gonna help me get ready at the motel, and then we're gonna go to the bar together.
Always the little philanthrope.
Though it's possible this outing might serve you both well.
I'm sure you're not aware of this but, our Alexis is unfortunately suffering a bit of a dry spell.
Exacerbated by this situation with the former lover, Ted, and his new girlfriend, Harriet?
- You mean Heather?
- I believe it's Heather.
Yeah, um, Ted and Heather have been together for hm, a while now.
They started dating when Alexis was still working at the vet's office.
She says it doesn't bother her, but sometimes I wonder.
Always the closed book, our Alexis.
Bless her soul.
I've always found her to be pretty open about things.
A closed book that falls open the second you take it off the shelf.
That's enough gossip for today, Twyla.
No, I'm not comfortable discussing the intimate details of Alexis' private life, with her not present.
Oh, I wasn't gossiping, it was just that you brought it up.
So I just wanted to clarify that it was Gossip is the devil's telephone.
Best to just hang up.
Erin: I left messages.
Ed: You did, well I didn't know that.
Uh, Donald seems to think that you said What's going on?
Well, Erin Brockovich has just started her job at the law firm, and she's not getting the respect she deserves, - because of the way she dresses.
- Not the movie!
This!
Oh, well I'm just showing a couple of our guests the set up.
Turns out, Carmine, here, is a big Albert Finney fan.
Roland, can I have a word?
Keep it on pause, boys.
Yeah, okay, I know what you're gonna say.
Better than expected, huh?
I specifically said no TV.
Johnny, I thought you were joking.
Why would you think I was joking?
I dunno, maybe it's your dry wit, you know, that never quite hits the target.
You're gonna have to say goodbye to Carmine and his friend.
It's his brother, Brian.
Although they could be friends too, I don't know, they could be brothers and friends.
Guys, how would you describe your relationship?
- Roland?
- Friendly?
You're supposed to be weeding the back lawn today!
Okay, but for the sake of customer service, try to chill out, my man.
I will chill out when the back lawn gets weeded!
Oh fine.
Fellas, finish it without me, sorry.
Erin: I trusted you.
Ed: Sorry about that, I really am.
Erin: I don't need pity, I need a paycheck.
And I've looked, but when you spent the past 6 years raising babies, it's really hard Has she broken up with the boyfriend yet?
Erin: are you gettin' every word of this down, honey?
Or am I talkin' too fast for you?
- Hi.
Hi.
Notice some of our more discreet backroom items are now on display at the front of the store.
That would have nothing to do with the conversation we just had before I left, would it?
Oh, well people have been asking for plungers, and uh, you insist on keeping them hidden away in the back room because you find them offensive.
- Hmm.
- So, uh, I thought given the demand for some more basic items, this could be a good opportunity for you to make a compromise.
Okay, I mean if assaulting customers with the sight of a toilet plunger the minute they walk in the door is something that you consider to be an effective business strategy, then that is a compromise that I am willing to make.
Are you sure?
- Look at his face.
- Look at your face.
Yes, yes.
Okay, great.
Well, then obviously you'll have no problem if I get the toilet brushes out here, too.
Is something wrong, David?
No.
You do this every night you go out?
I do this every night.
Well, look at the two of you.
Oh you remind me of my days at the old Mudd Club on the Lower East Side.
I remember one regrettably early morning with Johnny Thunders.
Okay, can we help you with something?
Oh, I'm sorry, can't a mother show a little interest in her only daughter's social calendar?
So, what establishment are we going to grace tonight?
It's just a bar on the outside of town.
And how are we getting around?
They don't allow you to drink and drive anymore.
We will be taking a cab.
No you won't!
I will drive you!
Oh dear, I have the night to myself, and I would like nothing better than to find a new man for Twyla.
I see before me, a beautiful young woman in her prime, who deserves every happiness.
Mrs. Rose, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
And I mean every word of it.
So I think you girls should allow me to play chauffeur for the evening.
It'll be the black car out front.
Okay, I know what our car looks like, but thank you.
Oh.
Before you go in, a bit of advice from someone who's been around.
Okay, pretty sure we didn't ask you, but sure.
If, and when, you meet someone who catches your eye, hold his gaze.
Then walk up behind him, trace a single finger down his back.
And if he follows you into a dark corner of the bar, it's meant to be.
Hm, that sounds super embarrassing.
It was my go-to move many years ago, and it always paid off.
And do you know who my last target was?
- Who was it?
- Ooh.
John Cougar - No.
- Mellencamp.
But guess who drove me home that night?
- Mr. Rose.
- Yes, you're right.
And that car ride was better than any dark corner dalliance with JCM.
Ew.
Sometimes in life and in love risks must be taken.
One never knows what may happen.
Okay?
Shall I wait here for you both?
Um, we're not in high school, so I think we're good, - but thank you.
- Okay.
Thanks for the ride, Mrs. Rose.
Okay, thanks!
Alexis!
You're wrinkled in the back.
- Ooh?
What?
- Confidence, girls!
Roland!
Take 'em off!
You're taking off?
All right, have a good night, Johnny.
What're you still doing here?
Well, I'm just kicking back a little bit.
It was a busy day.
Roland!
You have a pregnant wife at home, it's 9:00 at night, you're here playing video games?
What are you, hiding out?
No, I'm not hiding out, Johnny.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Jocelyn.
Roland, I brought you ribs for dinner.
Oh thank you, honey.
So, he seems to be making himself comfortable here.
Yes, a little little too comfortable.
Jocelyn, I don't wanna start anything here, but Roland did finish work a few hours ago, and I was telling him that he should be heading home?
Here's the thing.
I have just remembered how attentive Roland gets when I am pregnant.
He is very hands on, very concerned, and he is just always there.
So we were thinking that it might better, for me, if we could just kind of extend his work day, you know, to allow for some more alone time.
For me.
Okay.
I understand.
Oh!
Wow!
I just upgraded my wand!
Two more levels and I'll have enough opals to buy the harp.
Way to go, honey!
Alone time, Johnny.
I just need some alone time.
So, I don't think I'm gonna need a ride home tonight.
Oh my God, that's so great!
Because I think I'm going home with a guy.
No, yeah, I pieced that together.
He plays soccer, and he works at the quarry, and we both have the same second favourite color.
So important.
Your mom's trick totally worked.
I ran my finger down the backs of three different guys, and one of them turned around.
It's a total numbers game.
You're gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Of course.
I'm just so glad I took a risk.
Speaking of which that guy over there, he's been staring at you all night.
- Ted: Hello?
- Hey.
- Hello?
- Hey, can you hear me?
Just joking, you've got Ted's voice-mail.
Don't you hate it when people do that?
Me too, and yet I just did it.
Anyway, leave a message and I'll call you back.
Patrick: You know, I have to say, if we hadn't put these babies out there, there's a strong possibility we wouldn't have sold two of 'em today.
And a brush.
But at what cost?
You know?
And the mark-up on the plungers is actually very good.
Hmm.
Makes me think that we should be taking more products from the back and actually putting them out there.
Mhmm.
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
No!
no!
Fine, I'm terrible at compromise!
There, I said it.
Like Beyonce, I excel as a solo artist, and I was also dressed by my mother well into my teens, - okay?
- Let it out David, let it out.
I'm sorry that I just know what looks correct.
And this situation is not correct!
Toilet plungers on display at the front of a store, is incorrect!
Breath mints where the lip balms should be.
Not correct!
Not correct.
These mountaineering shoes that my boyfriend is wearing, looking like Oprah on a Thanksgiving Day hike, incorrect.
I'm sorry, what did you just say?
I said the breath mints need to move.
I think it was something about your boyfriend's shoes?
Um I don't remember saying that.
Yeah, no, that's what I heard.
Well hey, my boyfriend doesn't like the shoes, I could, I could take the shoes off.
I mean, or not.
I don't remember saying it.
So, you can do whatever you'd like.
I think my work here is done.
And what work is that, exactly?
My boyfriend doesn't like the shoes, so I'm gonna take the shoes off.
Okay, before you do that, um, I just wanna let you know that sock feet in a public place is also incorrect.
We do what we have to do.
Hello, you!
Hey.
You were in the bar?
How did I not see you?
I I wanted to wait for you, but I got bored in the car.
Bored, so I found a lovely little speakeasy at the back of the club.
Where's Twyla?
Oh, she used your little finger trick.
Oh!
So I guess we won't be waiting for her!
- Guess we won't.
- No.
Are you goin' back in?
No.
There's no one in there for me.
Okay.
Well, I I didn't want to say this in front of Twyla but there was a reason I drew Mr. Cougar Mellencamp into that dark corner of the bar instead of your father.
I don't need to know how this story ends, so Your father was with someone at the time.
But I knew there was something between us.
I just knew it.
Whatever it was, it was worth waiting for.
Well, that's very cute for you, but I don't know what that has to do with me.
It took a year.
A year?
But if it's meant to be, they'll come around!
Mhmm.
- Should we call it a night?
- Yes.
I think so, too.
- I'm driving?
- That's a good idea!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1   Flowers!
Oh, John, I do love how you keep the magic alive.
Well they're not from me, Moira.
"Sorry for your loss.
She was really something".
Ew.
Who was something?
Well, I don't know.
They didn't even put their name on the card.
- Alexis: Mom?
- In here.
Oh, thank God.
The internet says you're dead.
What?
Whadda ya mean?
Who's saying that?
Your mother's not dead.
I'm standing right here.
Yeah, well now I know, but it's weird - 'cause they're still saying it.
- So people are believing it?
Um, well it doesn't help that Alexis just tweeted "Goodbye to a great actress," with a cool sunglasses emoji.
Ok, I'm wearing sunglasses because I'm in mourning, David.
What is the source of this falsehood?
And what photo are they using?
Unclear and primarily a head-shot from the 90's, so fresh, and young, and permed.
So what are you saying?
The entire internet thinks your mother is dead?
- Um, well not like the entire internet.
-  It's not even trending, which is actually kind of sad.
- Mhmm.
- That's what you think is sad?
Someone just dropped these off for you.
I'm assuming you're not dead?
All right, consider this camel's back broken.
Who sends pink carnations?
Oh Johnny, Johnny, get over here.
Come on, lemme give you one.
Oh yeah.
Oh good, that feels good, doesn't it?
- She's - Let it out.
She's not dead, Roland.
Boy, it's strange, I can almost still smell her perfume.
It's because I was just talking to her.
Well, I understand.
You know, sometimes I wear Jocelyn's robe when she's outta town.
Yeah, it was a misprint, Roland, Moira's very much alive.
Oh, well, thank god!
Geez.
You know, I gotta be honest with you, this news really kinda hit me hard.
That's very nice.
Yeah, the first thing I thought of is what would happen to the baby if something happened to us?
Roland, this is kind of a heavy conversation - to have at 9 a.m., isn't it?
- Johnny, Johnny, I want you to be the godfather to my child.
What?
Well, it's a no-brainer, Johnny.
- I mean, we're best friends.
- Yeah but are we?
And to mark the occasion, I wanna take you to a celebratory lunch.
Well that's not necessary.
Well, nothing's too good for the godfather of my child.
I can't believe it.
I mean, I literally saw her walk past the cafe yesterday.
I know.
And again you know, my thing with ghosts?
- Yeah.
- But she didn't seem angry - like the other ones.
- Oh.
You know, it says here, that Moira was projected to be nominated for 10 Daytime People's Choice Awards.
- 12!
-  Oh my god.
The most projected nominee - to have never actually been nominated.
- Moira?
We were just reading an article that said you were Shh.
Fear not.
She hath risen!
It's so good to see you.
In the flesh.
Credit that internet!
Due to careless reporting, and the gullibility of the masses, everyone thinks I've died.
Yeah, because the news is everywhere.
Thank you.
Did you see the byline by Maria Menounos?
No?
How did it go?
The unsung hero of afternoon television.
Oh they're singing my praises now.
All:  Oh Moira, we are so happy that you are okay!
Yes, Jocelyn, thank you.
Can you imagine an alternate universe in which I've actually died?
Wow.
I wonder what you'd be saying.
I don't even wanna think about it.
I know, right?
But theoretically, what do we think we'd be saying right now?
Uh, she always kept things interesting.
Yeah.
Or uh heaven just got its newest leading lady.
All:  Alrighty, I think we should get to rehearsal, okay?
We can revisit this later.
Alexis: Thank you so much for taking me out, David.
I really needed it.
Especially after everything that's going on with Mom.
Okay, is that the reason, or is it because I'm on a buying trip, and that means you get free samples?
We make a very good team, David.
You do the talking, and I sample the merchandise.
And speaking of, we might have to circle back and get more of these peanut butter things - from those old farm witches.
- They were Mennonites, and I would put the peanut butter square down, we're about to spend the afternoon sampling a lot of cheese.
Hmm.
Nom nom for us, David.
Never say nom nom, again.
Anyway, this is a very important account for me.
I've been trying for the past little while to secure an exclusivity deal with this vendor, but she's very picky about her retailers.
Everyone's trying to get their greasy hands on her cheese.
Ew, David.
Wait, Warner Farms?
Does this cheese woman have animals on her farms?
Like goats?
Does she have goats?
Well, we're about to sample some goat's cheese, so I would imagine she has goats on her farm.
- This is Heather Warner's farm, David.
- I know.
No, like Heather, Heather.
Like, Ted's Heather.
What?
She's like 50.
0 She's 42, and I know!
- Ugh!
- Okay.
-  You know what?
I can't have your personal drama storming over my business dealings right now, so I think it's best if you got out of the car, - and walked home.
- Walked home?
That would take like 15 minutes, David, that's absolutely not happening.
Anyway, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Okay.
Um, then maybe it's best if you stayed in the car with the windows down.
Stop it, David, I'm not a baby.
So just   So Roland, I've been thinking about your very generous offer to be godfather to your baby.
It's not an offer, Johnny, it's an offer you can't refuse.
- Oh.
Ha ha, Marlon Brando.
- Right, but from what movie?
- The Godfather.
- No, from Casino.
Okay, fine.
It wasn't Casino, Brando wasn't in Casino, but - Hmm?
- Roland, I assume when you say godfather that it's, you know, just an honorary title?
No.
You'd have to step in and raise my kid if something happened to Jocelyn or me.
Which isn't gonna happen, but you never know in life.
Our house inspector said that our furnace could go any day.
Oh, and I'm thinking of getting Joce his-and-hers cliff diving lessons for her birthday.
Oh, yeah, well you see that concerns me a little.
Well, those are just kind of extreme examples, Johnny.
I mean, other than that I'm in the prime of good health.
Except for this friggin' mole on my back.
Okay, scoop of tuna on the Mediterranean salad, for you.
Thank you.
And the usual fried chicken on a waffle, extra skin.
- Okay.
- I will be right back - with the hot sauce and butter.
- Yes, and the gravy, Twyla, please.
Thank you.
Ah.
See the thing is, Roland, I don't think you realize just how big a responsibility you'd be, I don't wanna say strapping to my back, but Well, Johnny, that's why I'm asking you because um, I consider you family.
Oh.
Well, as a family member, I feel we can say anything to each other.
- Sure.
- And, quite frankly, your lifestyle choices are making me just a little nervous.
Don't worry about me.
Mmm mm.
- I'm okay.
- Good.
It's just a little piece of skin back there.
- Hmm.
-  - I got it.
Still good.
- Hmm.
Do you wanna have a bite?
I'll give you a bite you can't refuse.
No, no, that's okay.
That's fine.
I am done.
Well, this is quite the spread.
Hm, yeah.
Look at all this cheese.
Nom nom for I'm glad we could finally make this happen.
I know I've been a little hard to pin down.
It's just we're a family-run business, and there's an apprehension about branching out.
I totally, totally get that.
We are also a family-run business.
- This is my sister.
- Oh!
I thought you had a male business partner.
Oh, I do.
She is an intern.
Oh.
Um, in training to be CEO of executive buying so Okay.
Anyway, I just thought if we partnered together, we'd be able to extend your customer base, and raise your brand awareness.
Ultimately, like, raise brand awareness.
Listen, David, I love your store.
But I wanna be up front with you.
I have been approached by a couple of other retailers that I have to consider.
Hm.
Someone's in demand, isn't she?
Which makes sense because this cheese is amazing and like I don't usually love goat cheese, but Thank you.
I do have some prize-winning goats.
And it doesn't hurt that I'm dating a vet.
Fun.
Mm hmm.
Must be very helpful for you.
How's that going?
You know, there is something so familiar about your voice.
Oh.
No, people have told me that I just have like, - one of those voices.
- Mhmm.
Super generic and trill.
Anyway, I just happened to eat one of those pieces of blue cheese, and normally I don't like blue cheese in my mouth, but that was very not bad.
I am with you.
I wasn't a fan of it either until I started using it in salads.
- Oh.
- Speaking of salads, I just whipped up a big lunch.
I would love it if you guys could stay.
- Ooh.
- Ooh.
No, I for one just had like a very big peanut butter thing, so I'm feeling pretty Well, I for one did not.
So we would love to stay for lunch - with an important supplier.
- Great.
By all means, keep sampling, and I will start bringing out the food.
Oh um, I hope you don't mind if my boyfriend joins us?
I'm sorry?
Your boyfriend is here?
- Yeah.
- Mhmm.
You know what, I'm realizing that this might be an imposition.
Get in the car!
Not an imposition at all.
Ted?
The clients are gonna stay for lunch.
Would you mind helping me set the table?
Uh, sure.
Thanks.
Oh, Becca DeMornay, what a sweetheart.
It's times like this you learn who your true friends are.
I'm busy!
Stevie: There's kind of a situation out here.
Okay, come in.
Oh hey, so there's a reporter outside, asking questions.
I thought you should know.
A reporter?
Here?
Now!
Yeah, didn't you expect them to come?
Well, I thought it might be contained to the internet.
Is there a scrum?
How many camera crews?
I think just one.
Unless they all used the same van.
No.
No, Stevie, no.
This is not, not how I imagined my resurrection news to break!
Impeccably dressed woman wanders out of Podunk motel.
No, that's not the headline!
Okay, well I actually own this Podunk motel, and I don't know what choice you have.
Well, we have to think of something.
After all my fans have endured?
No, I can't let them see me like this.
It would kill Sir Tony Geary.
-  - No!
No!
Ah!
Stevie, help me!
Ah!
No!
- Okay.
Wow.
Well, this looks delicious.
Thank you so much for having us.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Well, this quiche is a treat.
I didn't know you'd gotten into prepared foods?
I haven't.
I just made this for lunch.
But if you've ever had her quiche, you can definitely say that it is eggs-cellent.
-  - Ted.
So how is it you know each other?
Um, well Uh well Alexis and I worked together.
She used to be my receptionist.
That's how I know your voice.
You answered the phones at the vet's clinic.
Yes!
Well, I mean, like technically I had more responsibility than just answering the phones but Oh, and Ted is the vet that you said you were dating.
- Yes.
- Okay, because when you said vet, I thought you meant like, - a War Vet.
-  Yeah, no definitely not a War Vet.
Damn these fallen arches.
I mean I must've called there every day, for months.
Yes.
Okay, okay.
David, see, now this all makes sense.
Mhmm.
-  - The quiche is vivacious, and that is not a word I use to describe quiche often, but you know, when the time is right.
You know, Alexis, I feel like I really need to thank you.
Had you not passed along all those messages to Ted, I mean, looked what happened.
I feel like we owe you, or something.
Hmm.
Well, she's a very generous person so  Well, if you are looking for a way to thank me, I know that David is looking for exclusivity on your products.
Ooh, she is good.
Okay, I'm in.
Um Well, that is why she is one of our finest interns.
We-we need to get ahead of this, Stevie.
We must, we must craft the perfect spin that both proclaims I'm not dead, and explains why I've been found here.
Um, okay.
We'll tell them you brainwashed me.
Could you tell then someone else brainwashed you?
A cult.
A cult.
Our family joined a cult.
There was a charismatic leader, 40 something, very sexual, had very long hair, longer than you'd expect, but it worked.
How 'bout this idea?
Um, what about telling the truth?
Truth serum.
Oh Stevie, yes, those stories are always successful.
- No, I meant the actual truth.
- Oh.
I've been reading what people have been saying about you.
They're gonna be really happy you're still around.
Yeah, I don't think loyalty was ever in question.
Then why not come forward and be honest about where you are?
Stevie, I don't Okay, that reporter's not gonna be out there forever.
This is your chance to tell your own story, in your own words.
Like we did during the writer's strike.
Right?
You have the opportunity to create your own headline!
Yes.
And honestly, would you rather be thought of as dead, than living here?
-  - Mrs. Rose?
No, I know.
I'm thinking on it.
Look, Jocelyn, the last thing I want is for this conversation to get uncomfortable.
Oh boy.
But-but there is a delicate issue that I wanted to talk about.
Roland asked if you wanted to be godfather to the baby.
- Yes!
- He has been asking everybody to be the godparent.
You're the 3rd person I've had to talk to today, so.
Oh, I see.
I just think he wants to make sure that our bases are covered, you know?
Well that's a relief, that your bases are covered.
But here's the good news, if something does happen to one of our first 3 choices, we will definitely be knocking on your door.
It's all for the best, Jocelyn, because frankly the thought of raising another kid Yeah, well, let's face it, your first 2 were no walk in the park, right.
Well, they're good kids.
Yeah, I mean you had a lotta help.
Yeah, but you know, we're very capable parents.
Well if you like, we could um, move you up the list?
No, no, no, but this has all been very, very helpful.
So, thank you.
Ahem, well, that went well.
Yeah.
You didn't have to do that.
I just like, hate how good this cheese is.
Thank you.
That wasn't the most comfortable situation to be in.
I'm just glad Ted's found someone so stable and healthy.
You're in love with him, aren't you?
Yes.
Yup.
Moira: I've always had great affection for the press, and my fans.
My fans, and the press, so thank you.
Yes!
Yes!
-  -  - Stevie!
-  Do you happen to know where the van went?
Uh, yeah, apparently there was another celebrity death.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who passed?
Um, you know that YouTube video of the giraffe and the kitten who are best friends?
Alas, I do not.
Okay, well the giraffe stepped on the kitten.
Well, of course he did.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I didn't think you were gonna talk to them.
Oh, uh you know what, I'm relieved.
Yes, enough of me for one day.
Yeah, well I mean, it's pretty amazing to see how many people care about you.
- Yeah.
- I mean if I died, I'd be lucky if 1 person had something nice to say.
Oh, Stevie.
Stevie, you have years ahead of you still to collect a cartage of adoring mourners.
In the meantime, they will laugh in your face, and they'll stab you in the back, but the moment you give up the ghost, oh they'll all have nothing but nice things to say about you.
I know I will.
Thank you, Mrs. Rose.
That's very comforting.
And I, for one, am through with trying to impress people.
I like the outfit you chose.
Well, you were a big help, Stevie.
Heading to the cafe.
It's always nice to dress for dinner.
Alexis: According to this, you're alive again.
Well, looks like we're back, sweetheart!
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
I guess we should think about returning some of these gifts?
John, they're perishable.
And excuse me, but this is the first time we've heard from most of these people.
These gifts are long overdue.
Oh my God!
As if this day couldn't get any worse.
What?
Cuppy the Kitten's dead.
Oh my god, what happened?
I don't know, I'm reading, David.
He stepped on her?
Weren't they best friends?
'K, Kelly Ripa just tweeted, she's taking tomorrow off.
Hashtag RIP Cuppy is trending.
Who's Cuppy?
Honestly, what kind of kitten befriends a giraffe?
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 Roland: Hey Ronnie, I need the combination to the safe.
It's your safe.
You have the combination.
Okay, then I need the number of a locksmith.
I used a guy this weekend.
Yeah, Gwen locked me out.
By accident.
Roland, why do you need the safe?
I've just been to the baby doctor, and I have some top secret information about whether it's a boy or a girl.
Joce and I wanna keep it a surprise.
Your wife's pregnant in her 40's.
How many surprises do you need?
Uh, it's kind of a Schitt family tradition there, Ronnie.
Okay, I guess I just gotta crack this myself.
It's either my birthday, or Gloria Estefan's.
- Mucho Dias, mes amis.
- Morning!
Anyway, moral of the story, I got a new keychain, and I keep a sleeping bag in the car.
Okay, turns out it's Gloria's, September 1, 57.
Who put a picture of a ghost on my desk?
- I can't believe you opened that!
- It was on my desk.
That's the sonogram of our baby!
I've been tryin' not to look at it.
We don't wanna know what we're having.
Roland, you couldn't possibly discern oh no, it tells you here at the bottom.
- Don't say a word.
- That's not fair!
Roland, why should I be the only one encumbered with this emotional cargo?
Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie, might you and I confabulate for a moment in the back room?
No, Moira, I'm not falling for that one.
No, I assure you.
I assure you it's a salacious bit of Council-related news.
Oh.
Robert?
Thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna say it, we've been open for 3 hours now, and not a single customer's walked through that door.
Well, I mean, I heard that there was a storm warning - for today, so.
- Oh.
How do you explain yesterday?
Maybe the storm warning was for yesterday.
So then how do you explain today?
Okay, I don't have all the answers.
Um, have we checked to see if the door is unlocked?
I think that we need to be a little more proactive about this.
We can't just wait for people to come in.
We have to find better ways to engage with the community.
Or, hey, just like a way.
Just one way to engage with the community.
Well, there's someone that is going to the cafÃ©.
You know why people are always in the cafÃ©?
Because they feel at home there, it feels like comfortable.
Okay, are you saying that I don't make people feel at home?
Um Okay.
You remember our opening day here?
Yes!
It was opening day, and there was booze.
- And people are drunks.
- Yes but they still showed up.
We need to do something to make this store feel a little bit more accessible, - a little bit more inclusive.
-  Okay.
Well, I am open to suggestions.
What if we hosted an open mic night?
I am open to suggestions.
I actually used to host one in high school.
There was a little cafÃ© around the corner from my house, it had a little stage in the back.
Drew a pretty big crowd.
Okay.
So there was a point at which you, and some of your fellow amateur singer songwriters would gather and perform poetry and songs?
- Yeah.
- For one another?
- Mhm.
That's right.
- Oh god.
The occasional improve troupe would stop by.
I'm um I'm feeling kind of ill.
David, you can laugh now, but an open mic night can be a surprising amount of fun.
Worst case scenario, we get some people in the store.
Okay, no, worst case scenario, I watch improv.
Okay, so first of all, I would like to thank you both for meeting with me today.
Was this really necessary?
That's a good question, and the answer is, yes.
Um, I'm just gonna say it.
This place needs a tonne of work, like top to tail.
We're talking serious, but manageable, fixes.
I think what you mean to say is proposed improvements?
No, I mean like full-blown things that need fixing.
Oh.
Um, the comment cards, for example, It's become very clear to me that you don't read them.
They're just a placebo effect for people who feel the need to complain.
Uh, you have to take those with a grain of salt, honey.
Those cards are written by embittered people with way too much time on their hands.
A lot of these are from Mom.
Um, but some of them are from people who are trying to point out things like, you don't even have a website.
- We have a website.
- No.
I looked it up, and it's just like a cartoon of a construction worker holding a sign that says "we'll be right back".
So.
It's under construction.
And the phone booking system works just fine.
Um, actually the phone booking system is confusing, and the woman's voice was aggressive and off-putting.
- I had strep at the time.
- Okay.
I'm gonna offer you both a PR and marketing strategy, pro Bono.
And if you're into it, we'll pull the trigger, we'll work on my contract and my salary, and then we'll get things going from there.
Well, now's not the time to take our foot off the gas, Stevie, and if we have a publicist at our disposal.
Would we call her a publicist?
Um, I actually prefer to be called - a freelance brand invigorator.
- Stevie: Hmm.
And I also have a super easy multi-step plan in place for the motel.
That sounds intense.
Um, maybe we should take a minute and think about this.
Well, I don't think there's any harm in exploring Step 1 of the plan.
That's great, because Step 1 of the plan was this presentation, and we nailed it.
So, as your new VP of Marketing and Communications, I'd say we're off to a great start.
Yeah.
I'll pass.
Don't worry, Moira, I'm not gonna ask you whether I'm having a boy or a girl.
Wonderful.
Roland told me what happened today, I just feel terrible that you are in this sticky situation.
Don't worry, I've propelled it to the back of my brain.
You must think that this is silly, but keeping the gender of the baby a secret is a bit of a tradition in Roland's family.
I believe he said so, yes.
It goes way back.
Way, way back.
Salem, Massachusetts, actually.
Yeah, his great-great-great great-grandmother accurately guessed the sex of her daughter's baby, and then was put on trial for witchcraft, - so, you would see why.
- Toil and trouble.
Roland never should've left that envelope on your desk.
And now look at you, burdened with this secret.
I mean, you must just wanna shout out "it's a boy"!
Or, "it's a girl"!
- Is it a girl?
- Valiant attempt, Jocelyn.
I was just testing you.
I mean, I wouldn't wanna break the Schitt family tradition.
Stupid witch!
Oh Jocelyn, look at yourself.
I know.
I'm embarrassed by my behaviour.
And you are being so strong, Moira.
I can't imagine just holding all that information, keeping it to yourself.
Veronica!
She just have forgotten her handbag.
I'm sorry, you were talking about something?
Someone took a long coffee break.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I miss the evening rush?
Uh, yes, one customer came in, who was asking for directions.
Well, I have good news.
I got us a permit for tomorrow night, and Ronnie says that we can get around the liquor license if we just charge people cover at the door, so.
What's the permit for?
The open mic night.
Oh!
So we're moving forward with the open mic night, then.
Yeah!
We're moving forward with it.
People are pretty excited about it, too.
Did you know Bob does beat poetry in his spare time?
No.
Oh god.
Um what's that-what's that?
This is called an acoustic guitar.
Right.
Okay, when we were talking about the open mic night, I thought that you would be hosting it, not performing at it.
Well, traditionally the host plays at least one song, so.
Right.
Okay.
So then you will be playing your acoustic guitar in front of people then, in public.
- And singing a song.
- And singing a song.
I was thinking about singing an original song.
- An original song?
- But then I thought you know, it's probably best just to stick with a classic.
Yeah.
Classic.
So I'm sensing some apprehension.
No, I think it's, you know, it's it's not scary or embarrassing for the person you're dating to sing at you with an acoustic guitar in front of people.
I think that's cool.
David, you're gonna be fine.
It's just a way to get some people in the store, okay?
Yeah.
Yes, for sure.
I mean, if you are, confident, to put yourself and our relationship at risk like that, then I am 87% behind you.
Good to know.
So now the only question is, - do I wear my fringed vest?
- Okay.
Or more importantly, do I wear anything under it?
Okay.
Okay, hi, hi.
This image is gonna be used as the key art for the new website, so it has to be like, on message.
Yes, uh, Stevie, Mr. Rose, the motivation here is two small-town friends welcoming guests to their humble motel.
Oh.
Should I be holding a key?
No, Mr. Rose, unless you wanna look really, really corny.
Yeah, like really, really cheesy, and off-brand.
All right, no key.
No key.
Just look at the camera like uh, it's a guest.
If the camera was your guest, how would you greet her?
I don't know.
Um, welcome to the Schitt's Creek Motel.
I'm Johnny Rose.
Um, yes, but no, don't use your mouth.
Uh, um, talk to the guests with your face.
Smile with your eyes.
What the fuck does that mean?
Okay, Johnny, what are we doing with our hands?
Alexis, I don't love you calling me Johnny.
- Okay, are we done here?
- Okay, it's probably my fault, but I don't think I've gotten a good photo yet.
Yeah, something about this is just not working for me.
Um, like can you  Okay, um, Mr. Rose, would you mind taking one step to your left?
Okay now, three more steps to your left.
So Stevie, one other angle that I'm playing is focusing just on you.
You're the hook.
Pretty country girl who doesn't care about big city things like dressing well, or how she looks.
We could rename the motel like, Stevie's Place.
Stevie's Place sounds like a shelter for battered men.
Okay, well the name was just a jumping off point.
Um, we could use your last name, and call it the Budd Inn.
And now that I'm saying that out loud, obviously we're not gonna do that.
But I do wanna focus on you.
Is this a team meeting, 'cause I'm part of the team.
Uh, no we're good, we're gonna focus on a solo shot.
Solo?
Don't take it personally, Mr. Rose, it's probably because you didn't know what to do with your hands.
Or maybe it's because your face looked like it tasted something sour.
Or maybe Thank you, Ray, I get it.
Okay, actually, I'm really not good with this.
Okay, Stevie, you need more confidence, - because this is all you.
-   Like literally anything.
Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.
We didn't budget for that, but sure.
Attention everyone, after much, much discussion, and a brief seance, Roland and I have decided We wanna know the sex of our baby, Moira!
Oh boy.
Uh, could we hold off until I get Gwen on the phone?
Are we really still talking about this?
Ronnie, you don't have to stick around - if you don't want to.
- No, no I'm in it now.
Well, I'm not so sure I am.
Knowing everything your great grandmother went through, I would no, I will not be held accountable for invoking a coven.
Uh, Gwen has stopped her Pilates tape for this, so uh, can we get a move on here?
Very well, then.
It's a girl.
Tammy!
- Or a boy.
- Huh?
- Perhaps it's a boy.
- Wait, which one is it?
All of a sudden, expected attention has me doubting what I saw.
I barely glanced at that paper.
No.
No, I very clearly remember, an M and an F, just can't recall which one was circled.
- Well, could you try?
- It's your fault!
You told me to keep it a secret, and that's exactly what I did, even from myself.
Okay, well nobody panic.
Where did you put the sonogram?
In the safe.
And I wrote down the new combination on a sticky note.
Perfect, so where's the sticky note?
Well, the sticky note, I believe, is also in the safe.
Well that, I will admit, is my blunder.
Gwen, you still there?
Hello?
I'm goin' home.
Hey, so no presh, but the hot 10 I've given you has turned into a very hot 20.
Yeah, I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.
Okay, um, babe, I get it.
You're probably thinking like, oh, is my foundation off by a shade?
Am I wearing the wrong top?
And the bottom line is, maybe.
- But you know what?
-  So, I'm playing around with Ray, we took some shots with my hands outta my pockets, and he thinks with a little Photoshopping, they may turn out okay.
- Everything good here?
- Um, Stevie has cold feet.
Okay, Stevie, I know this is a little overwhelming, but if you wanna grow the business, you gotta play the game.
Maybe I don't wanna play the game.
Maybe I don't wanna grow the business.
Okay, Stevie, as VP, and CEO of In-House publicity, growing the business is generally considered to be a good thing.
Right, but the more we grow the business, the more money we make.
And the more money we make, the more likely you are to take off, and then I will be left here stuck with way more responsibility than I ever asked for.
What would make you think I would walk away from this business?
Aside from the fact that your wife - talks about leaving every day?
- Okay, sorry to jump in again, but this conversation seems like something we should have had before the photo shoot.
Stevie, whatever decisions we make, we make them together.
Nobody's gonna leave you behind.
Can I get that in writing?
Yeah.
We can do that.
Okay, this is cute.
This is cute.
Ray should be seeing this.
Ray!
You should be seeing this.
- Johnny's looking half-normal.
-    - Hi.
- You see?
You see what I told you?
This is all it took to get people out on a work night.
Yup, a lot of people are shopping and drinking.
I don't even know if we need to do the open mic part.
Oh, we need the open mic part.
- Do we?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Hey, I think we're going to uh, get things started here.
-  - How's everybody doin'?
-  - Awesome.
Thanks so much for coming to uh, what I hope will be the first of many open mic nights here at the Rose Apothecary.
Um, David and I are so excited you could all come.
I see everybody's loaded up on drink tickets.
Oh yeah.
That's good news.
I'm going to uh, I guess I'm gonna get the party started, right after I tune up this little baby.
Oh dear, you're awfully brave allowing your beau to indulge himself like this.
Okay, this was not my idea.
All right, um I would like to dedicate this song to a very special someone in my life.
David Rose.
- Okay.
There he is, right there.
That's him.
Can't miss him.
You'll let me know if I should pull the fire alarm?
Yes.
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire You come to me wild and wired You come to me And give me everything I need Give me a life time of promises And a world of dreams Speak the language of love like you know what it means And it can't be wrong Take my heart and make it strong, babe 'Cause you're simply the best Better than all the rest Better than anyone Anyone I've met And I'm stuck on your heart I hang on every word you say Tear us apart Baby, I'd rather be dead In your heart I see The start of every night and every day - Moira?
-  Oh, you two, I told you I don't know.
But we do.
We called the doctor.
You did?
Lovely.
Don't you wanna know what it is?
I'll give you three guesses.
Moira, we're having a boy.
A boy, I believe I told you that.
How wonderful!
My boy right now is being serenaded by his butter-voiced beau.
In your heart I see The start of every night and every day In your eyes I get lost, I get washed away Just as long as I'm here in your arms I can be in no better place You're simply the best Better than all the rest Better than anyone Anyone I've met Oh, you're the best   Thank you.
Thank you!
Okay, I'm so excited for you to see this.
This would've been much more of a surprise, if I hadn't heard the construction all morning.
Okay, Stevie, you can take the blindfold off.
In 10 9 Okay, just take the blindfold off.
See Stevie, we're both up there, now.
Why isn't it just Rose Motel?
The Rosebud makes it a sad stunted thing.
Okay, it's just that Budd is Stevie's last name.
Oh, oh that's nice then.
Yeah, except it's Budd, with two d's, but Okay, well that would just look insane.
Also, I didn't know that.
Can we have breakfast now?
Yeah, let's celebrate.
Come on!
Oh, um, not to brag, but this re-brand got me 77% on my final marketing exam.
Okay, have you ever gotten an A?
Enough, David.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1  All right.
Morning, David.
Ew.
What are you all doing here?
We have a surprise for you.
Judging from the looks on your faces, I don't want it.
- Stevie?
- Stevie?
Something arrived at the front desk for you.
Ah!
It appears someone has something to celebrate.
Why would Patrick do that?
That was my first thought.
Celebrating a monthly anniversary seems a bit of a reach.
But then Alexis informed us that this is the longest relationship you've ever had!
- Four whole months, David.
- How 'bout that?
Okay, this is not the longest relationship I've ever had.
I had a very intimate connection with Tony, for several years.
She was your pen pal, David.
She was in a penitentiary, dear.
Well, this calls for a celebration.
Now Roland just found a barbecue in the shed, so, I say you invite Patrick over, we fire it up, and have a good old fashioned Rose family barbecue.
- Yes, David.
- I mean, we already have dessert.
I mean, this would feed at least 10 people.
Okay, first of all, no one's sharing the cookie.
And second of all, Patrick is not being invited to a barbecue.
- Is he pulling back?
- No!
Has he asked you about an open relationship?
Not yet.
Anyway, everything is fine, which is why I would rather not subject him to eating charred meat with this group of carnies.
Carnies are people too.
David, could you just once embrace joy?
Okay.
Perhaps it's this nay-saying reticence that caused your past relationships to - Fall apart.
- oxidize.
- Oxidize.
- Okay, you know what?
I think we're good here.
Thanks.
So you're bringing Patrick?
Nope, Patrick's still not coming.
Bye bye.
Oh yeah, it's soft.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
Take it the cookie went over well?
I have told you for three months now, that I don't want a monthly anniversary gift.
And I know you think it's very funny, but this time it went too far.
It's a cookie, David, what's the big deal?
First of all, a cookie is always a big deal, especially when that cookie just alerted my entire family to the fact that this is officially the longest relationship I've ever had.
This is the longest relationship you've ever had?
Oh, I shoulda got you more than a cookie.
Okay, well the cookie was almost too much.
Figuratively speaking.
I ate half of it on the way here.
Bottom line, I just don't think we need to celebrate as much.
You know, we could just go day-to-day like normal people.
If we throw a if we throw a renaissance fair every month, I just feel like we might be tempting fate.
We are not tempting fate, okay?
I can't speak to your past, but I think you might have an easier time of it, and maybe a little bit more fun, if you just learn to trust people.
The last time I heard that, I was dating a birthday clown who painted my face in the night, and was literally never seen from again.
Noted.
You have nothing to worry about, David, and I can return these tickets to the Julia Stiles-a-thon - at the drive-in tonight.
- Let me see those.
I agree, that might have been a little overboard.
Okay, first of all, let it be known that supporting Julia Stiles is never going overboard.
- Oh, so you can go?
- Um, not tonight.
Tonight I have a thing, but tomorrow I could come.
What's your thing tonight?
Um, it's just like a family thing at the motel.
It's like a nothing thing.
You wouldn't Okay, well tomorrow night it is.
Now I gotta go to town hall to get some signatures for our permit renewal, but don't worry, David, unlike the birthday clown, I will be back.
- He was never found.
- Probably dead.
You just fill this out and I'll get ya checked in.
- Great, thanks.
- Hey girl.
Oh, you're talkin' to me?
Yeah, who else would I be talking to?
No offense.
What's up?
Okay, so I wanted to get some advice, like girl-to-girl, 'cause you're always so good with boy stuff.
So David's at work and you had nobody else to talk to?
What?
That's So I got this message from Ted, and I wanted to get someone's your - Mhmm.
- Your, specific opinion before I replied.
Okay, so this is what Ted sent this morning.
I'm more of a bagel guy, winky face?
Keep in mind we haven't seen each other in weeks.
Okay, so it was an accident.
Or, it was made to look like an accident.
- Okay.
- It's a tactic, Stevie.
You send someone a random text message to get their attention, and then the next thing you know, you're talking again.
- Who would do that?
- I've done that.
Like a lot.
I did it last week.
This is why I choose not to be in a relationship.
Hey Alexis.
Rachel, sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but that's like the oldest trick in the book.
Texting a bunch of letters and saying your phone - was unlocked in your purse.
- Right?
I used to text Zac Efron just like a question mark whenever I wanted a booty call.
Poor thing would be like buzzing my apartment before I even pressed send.
That's actually how my fiancÃ© and I keep getting back together.
Okay, Rachel, you're in Room 9.
Oh, actually we're just finishing up.
Um, okay so what do you think I should write back?
Honestly I don't know anything about your relationship, but I do know that games only get you so far.
Unless you wanna end up like me, 6 months later, tryin' to win him back for the 50th time.
Mmhm.
Having flashbacks of Zac Efron.
Isn't it easier to just be direct?
Either way, you get an answer.
You're like super smart, and pretty in like a breezy, non-threatening sort of way.
Another successful girl talk.
You know, Roland, when you said you found a grill, this isn't exactly what I had in mind.
What'd you expect Johnny, Benihana?
No, there's no dials, no tanks, no side burners.
I mean I wasn't expecting a built-in wine fridge, but this is nothing like what I'm used to cooking on.
-  - What?
No, I'm sorry, I just had an image of you cooking.
Come on, Johnny, you're talking to a grill master.
Do you know that I've been given three different aprons because of my barbecue skills?
Let's see, I've got License to Grill, I've got Working Grill, oh and I have Grills Just Wanna Have Fun.
It's gonna take more than a license to grill to get this thing back to life.
Okay look, um, I can smell your fear, okay?
So why don't you go grab the meat and the briquettes, and I'll get this bad boy up and running for ya?
Okay well, thank you, Roland.
And just so you're aware, this has nothing to do with me not knowing my way around a grill.
I've watched many a personal chef flip a burger in my day.
I've got the perfect apron for ya, Poor Little Rich Grill.
I'll get it made up.
- I think so.
- I hope so.
It would only be fair.
Please tell me yes.
Uh, hi.
David, someone's ears must be a-flame.
When you said that you were coming back, you just meant that you weren't coming back, and that I would have to spend the afternoon searching for you on the train tracks, and among various unmarked vans.
You did that for me?
No, but there was a moment when I thought about doing it.
- David, blame me.
- Oh, I do.
Patrick was about to slip away with the signatures when I corralled him into a little lunchtime chin wag.
Yes, which is how I found out about the barbecue that I was invited to, but didn't know about.
Hmm.
Why didn't you tell me I was invited to the barbecue?
Well, they only wanted to have the barbecue after reading what was on your cookie.
Yeah, sorry that still sounds pretty nice to me.
- Thank you, Pat.
- It is nice.
No one's saying it's not nice.
What I'm saying is - Yeah, okay.
-  Pat, do you mind giving us the room for just a moment?
- Certainly.
- Okay.
Somebody should probably be at the store anyway, huh?
Lovely talking to you, Mrs. Rose.
You too.
Wow.
What are you doing?
I told you I didn't want to make a big deal out of this.
David you can't blame us for being excited.
Your father and I, we weren't involved in your past relationships, and from what I understand, it was one bungle after another.
I'm not saying there's a connection.
There's no connection, it's just a long string of very bad luck, and I don't know what kind of carnage I inflicted in a past life, to deserve it.
I must've been Dracula, or a spin instructor.
And what if we could finally tie a sailor's knot in that string of bad luck?
Because after spending 5 minutes alone with sweet Pat, We're not doing Pat.
He sees you.
For all that you are.
Well, hopefully not all that I am, I mean that would be Oh, David, you have the opportunity to climb out of the quicksand that was your past, and stand firmly in the present.
Let us celebrate that.
Fine.
He can come.
Excellent.
And he's bringing his guitar.
- What?
- Well, it was mostly his idea, you know, in case there's a rousing fireside sing-along?
No, I draw the line at sing-along.
Whoa, geez, Louise.
Alexis, hey.
Hey.
I was in the neighbourhood, so I thought I'd just pop in and say hey.
I was gonna send a text but um, I thought it'd be better if I just came in.
I'm glad you did.
I'm also glad I did.
It's good to see you.
It's also good to see you.
Okay, well I just wanted to say hey, and I'm here, and I got your text.
What text?
The text.
Did I send a text?
Maybe no?
Maybe you didn't.
Did you?
I'm not sure.
What, uh, what'd it say?
Nothing.
I don't think it said anything, now that I think about it.
Um no something about you being more of a bagel guy.
- Oh my god, did I send that to you?
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh my gosh, I did.
- Did you, though?
I'm sorry, that wasn't supposed to be sent to you.
Hello dummy, why do you think I'm here?
I'm here to tell you to be careful because with those texts, those texts in the wrong hands, Yeah, it was actually meant for Heather.
Heather, yes.
Yes.
- You and Heath and the bagels.
- Yeah, she was just asking if she should pick up scones or bagels.
Anyway, now we know.
Now we know.
You shoulda just texted.
You didn't have to come all the way down here.
Well no um, as I was saying, I was in the area.
So, I just wanted to pop in and see the look on your face when you realized that you'd sent the text - to the wrong person.
- Ooh.
Um, hmm.
Um, hey I'm sorry if I haven't been in touch - as much recently.
- Oh my god, please.
Please.
Uh no, I should get outta your hair.
But it was good to see you, Mr. Bagel.
That's a you-and-Heather thing, but now that you texted me, it's kind of like an all-of-us thing.
So, have a great afternoon today.
Looking good, Roland!
What time do you wanna fire this baby up?
Uh, I dunno, probably about an hour before you wanna eat.
Oh, well I was hoping to eat around 8.
Where are we, Barcelona?
- Uh, well then 7.
- Yeah, 7 sounds better.
- Honey, you ready to go?
- Yeah.
Wait, wait, where are you going?
Oh, Jocelyn and I have another one of those birthing rehearsals we gotta go to.
I just bought $100 worth of sliders.
Geez Johnny, thanks for rubbing it in - when you know I can't come.
- You can't come?
You didn't say you can't come!
You were bragging about being a grill master.
He really is.
Did you tell him about the aprons?
Yes he did!
And I was counting on him to do the grilling!
You know Johnny, maybe you should consider calling off the barbecue.
Well, I'm not calling it off!
I just have to figure this thing out.
Right, cut to .
Well, we're not cutting to .
Cut to, I've ruined my sliders!
Cut to, how does this thing work?
See, this wasn't as hard as you thought it was.
Mr. Rose, would you mind taking a few steps back?
Oh, what you're gonna spray the briquettes again?
Nope.
You guys want me to jump in?
No, I think we've got it covered.
Oh, you do, oh great, 'cause I'm gonna get another beer.
- Hmm?
- There ya go.
All right.
Well, finally.
Back at the old grill.
I'd say that one looks about perfect.
I was gonna say the same thing.
Specifically which one were you talking about?
- Just this one, here.
- Oh yeah, that's the one.
Okay, should I save him?
Oh they'll be fine.
Let's just sit back and enjoy the sight of our two strapping men bonding over an open flame.
Johnny: This one looks good, is this one cooked?
Okay, so what else is new?
How's the shop?
- Hmm, thriving.
- Yes.
Which is shocking because as you may or may not know, I've struggled with group work in the past.
David, you are living an exciting new chapter in the book on tape of your life.
And you, you did this all by yourself.
Okay, just so you know, that's not really a compliment, but thank you.
- Oh my god, hey.
- Hi.
Um, so I took your advice, which in retrospect is weird considering we like literally just met.
Fair enough.
And?
Turns out that text message wasn't for me after all.
Oh.
His girlfriend was at a bakery, hence the whole "I prefer bagels thing".
Right.
So that girlfriend detail woulda been pretty useful in the conversation we had earlier, but still, I'm sorry.
Oh, I feel somewhat responsible.
Yeah, I can see that.
It's just weird because like, I'm always the one being chased.
I assumed that, based on your face, and body.
Right?
At least you got your answer.
You know what, Rach, part of me feels like we were destined to meet today.
Well, that would make you the one good thing to come outta my day.
- Oh no.
- Yeah.
To be honest, I came here to win someone back, and it didn't happen.
So, my big grand gesture ends here.
Sleeping alone in some roadside motel.
Listen, it's not over yet.
Why don't you come with me to the barbecue that my parents are throwing?
We can be each other's little little daties.
I would love that.
Thank you.
- That's it, watch your step.
- Yeah.
Okay, right, here.
Perfect.
Perfect.
There ya go, we make a good team, Pat.
- No, John, no, we're not doing Pat.
- No we're not.
Okay, we're not waiting for Alexis, are we?
Because honestly, I could eat this tablecloth.
- Medium rare for David.
- Thank you.
You know um, this wasn't actually the first time that I've been put to work by the Rose family.
My first job in high school was actually at a Rose Video.
Get outta town!
What branch?
- 785.
- 785.
- Impressive late fees.
- Thank you.
Can you pass the ketchup, please?
Okay, how did I not know that you worked at a Rose Video?
Well, let's hope that you continue to surprise each other.
It keeps the relationship titillating.
Okay, please never say titillating when referring to my relationship.
- Oh, can I though?
- No.
Well, anyone with a glass, please raise them.
To relationships old and new.
Um, thanks for waiting.
Alexis!
Just in time!
Everybody, this is my new friend Rachel, she's having a bit of a day.
Patrick?
Rachel, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I've been texting you for 2 days.
Wait, Patrick is your fiancÃ©?
Uh, I'm sorry you have a fiancÃ©e?
No I I mean I don't now.
But yes, at some point I mean we we were Patrick, what's going on here?
Okay, um, I just think I might need a sec.
David.
I'm gonna talk to you in a minute, we've got a lot to talk about.
Who is she?
I glanced down at my plate for two seconds.
David, I-I need to explain a couple of things.
Um, what would be the main one, do you think?
Rachel and I were engaged, but I called it off before I moved here.
Okay, you know what, you don't need to explain yourself.
- I think I think that I do.
- No, I know you do, that's just what I'm supposed to be saying in the moment, so, please continue.
- Okay um, we got together when we were in high school, and we've been on and off ever since.
I don't know we always just sorta fell back into it.
Anyway, she's been reaching out and expecting us to get back together for the past few months.
- Whoa.
Over the past few months?
And you didn't think to tell me about this?
You stood in front of me and told me to trust people.
I know.
When I was perfectly fine not trusting people.
Not trusting people is what I'm used to.
It is my comfort zone.
But next thing I know, there's an oversized cookie on my doorstep, and you are telling me that I have nothing to worry about.
I didn't want it to affect what we have.
Okay?
And I mean it when I tell you that you have nothing to worry about.
'Cause no matter how hard I tried with her, it just never felt right.
And up until recently, I didn't understand why.
David, I've spent most of my life not knowing what right was supposed to feel like, and then I met you.
And everything changed.
You make me feel right, David.
That is quite possibly one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard anyone say.
Um outside of the "Downton Christmas Special".
- It's the truth.
- I know um it's just that my truth is that I am damaged goods, and this has really messed things up for me.
And I think I need some time with it.
All right.
Actually um, I haven't had dinner yet, so I'll grab ya a slider.
More than one, um, and some potato salad, and I think there were some other sides on the table, but I couldn't see, so maybe just a smattering of everything.
Okay.
Okay.
Woman on  I talked to Tony yesterday, he seemed very, very upset.
Okay, how long do you think before I can go in there?
Well, I don't know, he had 6 sliders.
I'm assuming he'll be falling asleep soon.
My poor baby.
I told him he was out of the quicksand, but he's not, John, he's sinking.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
Okay, don't get me wrong, I feel super bad, and partially responsible because I invited Rachel to the barbecue, but at the same time, he's been watching that show for 3 hours and my phone's in there.
Well, you might have to go one night - without your phone, Alexis.
- Ugh!
-  - David!
David!
Woman on  I know he will, but what's gone so wrong between the two of you?
What's so wrong that it can't be patched up?
- You don't mean Yes, it's true!
-
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1   Um, Alexis, do you mind telling your phone to fuck off?
Ugh.
What's bumpkin?
What?
Nothing.
Gimme that.
Oh my god, is this a dating app?
It's an online social hub for rural singles, if you must know, David.
I signed Twyla up.
Well, why does it say Alexis you have a new match?
Research.
I was testing the water for her, David.
Poor thing's clueless.
Well, Miguel says hi.
Why is he shirtless with an armful of puppies?
Oh my god, we matched?
His nipples are out.
Ted can't know about this, David.
Miguel's the only other vet in town, and they have this like dumb rivalry.
When has that ever stopped you?
I remember that summer you dated all 3 Hanson brothers.
This is different.
I no longer need backstage passes to the Teen Choice Awards.
How did you even match with Miguel in the first place?
I swiped right, obviously.
Like look at him, David.
I didn't actually expect we'd match.
- You didn't expect to match.
- Okay, fine, I did, but I just wanted to see what would happen.
He's the only attractive person on here, David, what did you want me to do?
Well, then go on a date with him.
- I can't.
- Fine, then don't.
- Okay, but I want to, David.
- Oh my god, Alexis, I am suffering romantically right now, and there was a minute when I thought I would never have to look at another dating app, and here you are shoving Bumpkins in my face.
It's Bumpkin with a wink emoji.
-  - He messaged me again.
He actually sounds kind of chill, David.
What did he say?
- Sup?
- Okay.
Ready when you are, Mr. Rose.
Ready for what?
We have a 1:00 reservation for lunch at the cafÃ©.
Oh Moira, I completely forgot about lunch.
-  - And I just gave Stevie the day off.
How many days off is Stevie allowed to request?
Well, she'd worked 14 straight days, so It's starting to remind me of Rose Video, when your work consumed you, and I would miss you so.
Except now I don't have the jet and the free DVD's to distract me.
Well, I don't know what to say, Sweetheart, I-I still have most of the rooms to clean.
Would it be too much to ask the guests to clean up after themselves?
Hm, yes, it would.
It's basically the only service we provide.
Very well.
If lunch is canceled, I suppose I'll show up on time for Jazzagals rehearsal.
Isn't that something you should be doing anyway?
Oh, there's so much time wasted off top, John.
Yap, yap, yap, do, re, mi.
A lip buzzing 'til I'm blue in the face!
I promise I'll make it up to you, Sweetheart.
Okay.
As long as we're tabulating scores, this will mark the 3rd time you stood me up this week, John.
Hmm.
Turn everything off, please.
- Why aren't you dressed?
- Because I'm not going.
Because I'm too tired.
You've been sleeping for two days.
What's your point?
I'm finding it hard to believe that you don't have the energy to go to a spa.
I know, I'm scaring even me.
Why are we going to a spa, again?
Because you're having boyfriend issues, and this is my reluctant attempt at being supportive.
Well, that's very thoughtful of you.
I also have a Groupon, which I was planning on using with Jake, but I thought you might need it more, so, get up before I change my mind.
- I can't.
- Get up.
No!
Oh my god, David.
Ah!
This is really pathetic.
What kinda spa is it, and will there be treatments?
You're a monster.
Twyla: Miguel looks so strong holding all those puppies.
Maybe I should get into online dating?
Oh, I'm not into online dating, I'm just showing David how it works.
- So when are you seeing him?
- Oh wow, no, I don't think that would actually be a good idea.
In fact, I might have to cancel on him tonight.
So you are seeing him?
Technically yes, but like, he and Ted have this thing.
Oh, and Ted asked you not to see him.
No, he doesn't know.
Sorry, so what's the problem?
I mean, Ted's not going on a date with him.
Yeah, I mean I guess there isn't really anything - standing in the way.
- So there you go.
It's just that I used to date Ted, and now I'm gonna be dating this guy, and it's just gonna be weird, and I don't wanna do anything to upset Ted.
So then maybe don't go on a date with this guy?
It's just that there are like ten guys on here, and three of them are Ray.
Yeah.
Fat spatula Fat spatula Fat spatula Fat spatula Fat spatula - Fat spat - Ah!
John, what are you doing here?
Is it David?
Oh no, you can speak freely in front of the gals.
No, no, David's fine.
David's fine.
A little depressed.
Stevie had to force him into her car, but you know.
Then, to what do we owe this off-book sojourn?
Well, I thought about what you said, and I didn't wanna fall into old habits, so I delegated the rest of the cleaning to Roland.
Sweet gesture, but was that wise?
No offense, Jocelyn.
I was gonna ask him the same thing.
And that frees us up for a little date night, uh, after you've finished rehearsing.
Oh, where are you taking her?
- The cafÃ©.
- Ah!
If that doesn't scream romance.
There was a time when this dusky charmer used to constantly whisk me off to ports unknown.
Gals:  Actually Johnny, Ronnie could always use another baritone, why don't you join us?
Oh, no.
No, I'm just here to show support.
So, as you were.
Oh, my husband, the portrait of self-effacement.
You should all know that this man's voice melted more than a few hearts.
Johnny, why don't you just come and join Ronnie?
Oh, no, no, no!
No, no, I haven't used the old pipes in so long, and I I wouldn't want to impo-o-o-ose  Somebody just nailed their audition.
Oh, ha ha.
I've got perfect pitch, so do not mess this up for me.
- I understand.
- Okay.
Oh wow.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
Yeah, um, so Jake and I found out that if you tell these resorts that it's your honeymoon, they usually upgrade your room and stuff, and give you free booze, but uh, We've never had anything like this before.
Oh.
Lucky me.
Sorry.
Shoulda just told 'em the wedding's off.
Mhmm.
So, Jake and his little pony are goin' on dates and having sexy honeymoon weekends?
No, only sometimes, when it's necessary.
Hmm.
So you're in love then.
You're like falling in love with Jake.
It's impossible to be in love with Jake, only Jake is in love with Jake.
He's just really good at celebrating my body.
So, I'm keepin' him around.
Have you heard from Patrick?
We're taking some time to regroup at the moment.
Ooh.
Feeling very raw right now, you know?
Um, it's just like a lot of emotional triggers.
Like that?
So, thank you for saving me from myself because one more day at that motel and I think things would've gotten very dark.
Hm.
No problem.
Just put this on.
Okay I'm not playing into your fraudulent behaviour.
You still want the free booze, right?
Gimme the ring.
Can't believe I caught that.
Do do do do I feel so far away 1, 2, 3, 4!
I feel so far away When we're takin' it home takin' it home - Takin' it home!
-  Yeah.
Woo!
- Not bad.
Not bad.
- Oh thank you, Ronnie.
Oh John, a near-perfect return to form.
I thought it was really great.
Ah, Mrs. Rose, I didn't know there were two singers in the family.
Well, professionally speaking there's still only one.
But I do applaud the vigor with which you embrace recreational activities such as this, Mr. Rose.
Well, anything to spend a little more time with my special little songbird.
Gals:  Ooh, Okay ladies, if you don't mind, I'm going to allow my husband to steal me away, for a modest repast across the avenue.
And I should get back for my shift.
And we're still going for post-rehearsal mocktails, right ladies?
I dunno about anybody else, but I am drinkin'.
So we're all headed in the same direction?
Jocelyn: It looks like it.
I'll get out the fancy martini glasses.
Fun!
Boy, we never did this back in the Rose Video days, did we?
No, but I'm sure we had our reasons.
- Alexis.
- Yes?
- Miguel.
- Oh my gosh, hey.
Hi.
I didn't recognize you without your nipples.
- Huh?
- The puppies the um, the cute little puppies that you love to photograph yourself with.
Ha ha, yeah, yeah, I left them at home.
The puppies.
Brought the nipples.
- Oh good.
Not about the nipples, um, about the puppies.
- Right.
- So anyway, how are you?
Uh good.
Good, good.
I'm just really glad we could make this work.
Champagne?
Uh, they serve champagne here?
I believe it's called Zhampagne, it's from the very famous Zhampagne region of France.
- Can't wait to try it.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.
- So, um, how long you been on the app?
Uh, oh I'm not.
Well I am, but I just downloaded it to show a friend.
Well, worked out well for me.
Someone's a smooth talker.
- No.
- This is a relief.
I um, I was actually thinking about not coming.
What was holding you back?
Uh, I dunno, just like am I ready for this, and I'm not even on the app, so like should I be using it?
Right.
I just like making careful choices.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just glad that you you could come out tonight.
Um,  to careful choices.
Yes.
To that.
Okay, everybody.
Hi.
I'm Bobbie, and I am so excited to be your waitress.
We just love honeymooners here at Crystal Elms.
Please, right this way.
Here you go.
Wow.
- Oh my god.
- Thank you.
Okay, and I will be right back with your menus.
Okay.
- No.
Absolutely not.
- Okay, and I completely understand.
Um, I just worry that if we don't put the hats on, that the other guests will inevitably force us to.
Okay.
So.
So, turns out we are not the only ones celebrating the bride and groom.
This is from a Patrick.
Says, "have fun, enjoy the night.
Thinking about you".
Oh, wow, that is just very sweet.
And I can assure you that a fun night is guaranteed after a bottle of this.
Right?
Yeah, she gets it.
Okay.
Did our waitress just make a sex reference?
I mean, I don't think that's really surprising at this point.
Um, so you obviously have spoken to Patrick since he knows we're here.
Okay um, we may have been texting.
He's covering for me at work.
And these, these are our complimentary lovebird wings.
They are chicken, not actual lovebirds.
Uh, and oh, the special tonight is a lover's curry.
So, I will be back, and I will take your order.
Okay so.
Oh, wow.
- Oh, one more.
- Oh my god.
Oh.
Sorry, you were saying?
Um, how did you get so good at this?
Hm, you learn pretty quickly when you're in a Ugandan diamond smuggler's villa playing for your friend's freedom.
- Right, right.
Wait, what?
- That was fun.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I don't uh you know, I don't get to date a lot.
Busy schedule and and whatnot, but there is just something about you, you know -  - I actually, I changed my shirt 3 times for tonight and uh, I'm sorry, I probably shouldn't be giving that all away.
No, it's cute.
And I was actually nervous, too.
Well, you you look great.
No, yeah, I know it wasn't that.
Um, you're gonna think this is so random, but it was actually about something else.
Well, whatever it was, I'm just glad that we could do this.
I used to date Ted.
- I'm sorry?
- Ted Mullins?
- He's the veterinarian.
- No, no, no, I know who Ted is.
- Okay cool, I just felt like we were being honest with each other.
Wait, weren't you his receptionist?
Executive Assistant.
And yes, but only for like a minute.
But you guys were engaged?
- Um, very briefly.
- Uh-huh.
And just twice.
And we've both moved on.
He has a girlfriend now, and apparently they're like very serious.
Okay look, there is nobody who wants to see Ted fail more than I do, professionally speaking.
Personally, I feel like this is off limits.
It just feels wrong.
Okay, that is what I've been saying, to literally everyone.
What, you've been telling people about this?
No.
Some people.
Just close friends.
And that is the reason that I wasn't gonna come tonight.
- Yeah, but you came.
- Okay, bottom line, we've both had a lot of Zhampagne, so I just feel like we need to hydrate, and reflect.
Wow.
I mean, yeah, but I don't think I can do this.
Okay, just to be clear, I couldn't do this first.
So I guess I am paying for the Zhampagne then?
And so, he says to the cop, "Well, if it was mine, I wouldn't've put it in my mouth".
Oh, Veronica, once again, you reign supreme as the queen of the triple entendres.
I just have to say this.
I know that we are the Jazzagals, but it was pretty great to have a Jazza-guy in our midst today.
Oh.
Yeah, if you're around next week, it wouldn't hurt to have the help.
Not to dim the charge on this delightful conversation, but John, why don't you and I go - and get the gals another drink?
- Okay.
No, no, the next round is on us for our newest member.
Lemonades for Moira and me And two cosmos for the baritone section.
Yes, please  John, I wanna thank you for what you did for me today.
And I know it was done with the best of intentions.
I'm getting the sense I did something wrong.
Oh, not at all.
In fact, you've enlightened me.
I realize I take one thing for granted in this town.
- Oh, Moira.
- My time with the Jazzagals.
Ah.
As sad as it sounds, these rehearsals have become a tiny oasis in the echo-y canyon that I now call my social life.
I don't know if you've noticed, John, but this transition has not been the easiest for me.
I can't say that I have not noticed.
Aside from rehearsals, few things keep me going.
My nightly sleeps, afternoon naps, and of course meals with my husband.
And there will be more of those.
But John, I have so few pleasures, that if I start combining them, then I'll have even less to look forward to.
I understand, Moira.
So, would you like me to leave you to cocktails with the gals, then?
Oh god, no, we'll leave together, please.
There are only so many ways I can feign amusement at Ronnie's comedia Del commode.
So the lover's curry was a mistake.
Yeah, it was.
Uh, but we got through it, and now we have a story we can only tell each other so Patrick would find it funny.
We will not be telling Patrick.
Another secret for the pile.
Okay, not to put any of the blame on you in this situation.
Obviously Patrick should've told you he had a fiancÃ©e, but why didn't you ask him?
If he had a secret fiancÃ©e?
Well, no, but did you guys not talk about your dating history?
I guess I just thought the deeper we got into his past, the deeper we'd have to get into mine.
And, historically speaking, the more I revealed of myself, the less interested people got.
So.
Okay, so I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that you were probably surrounding yourself with the wrong people, and we both know that Patrick is not that kind of person.
Also, I know everything about you, about your history, your family, and I'm still here.
I think you're my best friend.
You think?
Well, I can't know for sure, because I'm realizing now that I don't think I've ever really had one.
Okay, well, if we're being honest, I don't think I've ever had one, either.
This would be a really sweet moment, if what we had just admitted to each other wasn't so sad.
Sadder?
When you were in the bathroom, I finished the rest of the lover's curry.
Okay, you'll be sleeping in the bathtub tonight.
I understand.
Well, honey, I don't think you should let one embarrassing encounter color your experience, on Bumper.
- Bump-kin.
So you upload your photo, and the Bumpkin sends it to local singles.
It's not called The Bumpkin.
Okay.
Oh, here's one.
Isaac, 31, works on his family's farm.
Certainly loves to take pictures of himself in waterfalls.
Hmm.
Though harvesting crops does produce a nicely-sculpted physique.
"Looking for a hook-up".
Well, that sounds promising, Alexis, he's open for hooking up for dinner, or drinks.
Uh-uh, that's not what that means.
- Okay, moving on to Jebediah.
- Okay, stop!
Comes from a large family.
Oh, not my kids.
That's a step in the right direction, Alexis.
- Scroll down, Moira.
- Okay.
Oh my wives.
All right, which way do you swipe to get rid of this one?
- Okay, gimme my phone - Oh, Alexis, look, you've just Bumpkined with Jebediah.
- What?
Ew!
- Oh, and now we're back to Ray.
Ew!
How did Ray get such a beautiful bathroom?
Well
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1  Johnny: And, there she is!
Hot off the presses!
Alexis Rose.
Why is there a line through it?
Oh, toner must be low.
This certificate reminds me of the one you were awarded for getting your braces off.
Now that was a grand day.
Yes, except my orthodontist had a slightly better printer.
I'm sorry, did David spend four months earning a degree?
Alexis, we're equally proud of you, dear.
Let's see what this says, Alexis?
Elmdale College, Alexis Rose, - majoring in Marketing and -  Looks like a bit of a typo.
- Pubic relations.
- What?
- No.
- Oh my god, give me that!
No, honey, obviously it's a bit a of a misprint.
- Is it though, do you think?
-  David, do not diminish your sister's accomplishments.
- She didn't do anything to your -  I wanted to frame this!
- Hmm.
-  - It looks good!
-  -   Oh no  So you're wearing a leather sweater, in the dead of summer.
You look good.
- Thank you.
You look ready.
I am.
You know what you're gonna say?
I'm gonna walk in, and I am gonna tell him that I am, ready to get back together.
Well, that's what you said you were gonna say to him two days ago, and yet, here we are.
Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I was ready, ready.
You know, for-for both of our sakes?
Mm hmm.
That's a nice bracelet.
- Did you get that from Patrick?
- I might have.
So you waiting a full week to forgive him has nothing to do with the fact that he showered you with gifts and attention every day.
That is purely coincidental!
I was just working up the strength, to be able to put our differences aside, for the future of our relationship.
Well, I know I lot of people who are gonna be very excited that you guys have worked things out.
Well, that is very touching.
I'm glad that we have everyone's support.
Yeah, I think it's that, uh, and I think it's the fact that you've been a smidge needy this past week?
- Hmm.
- Maybe needy's the wrong word.
- Hmm.
- Clingy?
I see.
Well I'm glad everyone's gonna be able to sleep soundly tonight, because I am going to do this.
Good luck.
Thank you.
And I have missed him a lot.
And I am very excited to not, not be with him anymore.
I know.
You sure you don't wanna wait another day, though?
I mean you never know what could show up on your doorstep.
I don't like what you're insinuating.
That said, if a package does arrive, please keep it safe.
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?
Oh, always.
Just not now.
Council is about to decide which bid will be awarded the first-ever district-wide Arts and Culture Grant.
I know.
Which is why I wanted to give you this.
And what, pray tell, might this collection of words be?
As of today, feel free to refer to me as Alexis Rose, Founder and CEO of Alexis Rose Communications.
Alexis, that's wonderful!
This is my first business proposal.
I'm throwing my hat in the ring for the Arts and Culture Grant.
Wow!
Now, don't get me wrong, there is no High-Street beret that I would rather have thrown in my ring, but, I have a funny feeling Council already has its favourite.
Okay, well I wish I knew it was rigged before I worked so hard on it.
Oh, very well, Alexis, let's hear your elevator pitch.
But bear in mind, I have to get off on the next floor.
Okay, um, it's a singles night at the cafÃ©.
And the goal is, um, to get people from nearby communities together, for like romance and nibblies.
And hire some staff, and dating experts, and make a whole night of it.
Darling, I realize the pickings are slim in this rural spanandry, but you can't ask Council to misuse public funds just so that you can find yourself a new boy toy.
Excuse me, this has nothing to do with the fact that I'm single.
The singles market is very lucrative.
Did you know, that there's a small town in Ireland that hosts a singles week every year, and it's become so popular, that they're able to subsidize their entirely yearly budget, just on profits?
It's a valiant first effort, Alexis, it is.
But darling, do keep those wheels turning!
As the Irish like to say, it's a cinch to mash the Murphy where there's love.
Ugh!
Morning.
Uh oh, looks like something showed up for you this morning.
O-Kay?
Who's it from?
Well, there might be a hint in the card.
Congratulations, Employee of the Month?
Since when has this been a thing?
Well, this is the second month.
I won it last month, took myself out for lunch.
I'm kidding.
It's a little incentive for a job well done.
Oh, I mean, wouldn't wanna be ungrateful.
Uh this seems like some makeup?
It's like a briefcase full of makeup.
Yeah, only the best.
And you thought of this for me because?
Because you deserve it.
I see.
Well, I'm gonna save this for a special occasion.
No, no, no, it's for everyday use.
It's what the woman in the store told me.
Thanks.
Stevie?
Aren't you forgetting something?
Uh, I just just don't know how to thank you.
Oh, that smile on your face is all I need.
Hi.
Hi.
So, after some time alone, I just wanted to come here, and tell you, that I David, I need to apologize to you.
I was going to sleep last night and I realized I have not been respectful of your space.
All of the texts, and the gifts.
Uh, I was upset, and it was reactionary, and I thought I was doing the right thing, but really all I was doing was smothering you, when you had asked for space, and that's not right.
Okay, well smothering's a bit intense.
It was self-serving, and it was desperate, and, and I'm I'm embarrassed.
Okay, there's no need to feel embarrassed.
Well, I am.
I've just been trying to deal with everything here at the store, and I think you're right.
It's probably better if we just focus on the business, and, and not try to push anything.
I'm not sure I said that.
You didn't have to.
In fact, by saying nothing at all, you you spoke volumes.
Okay, s so you would like to focus on the store, then?
I think that's probably a good idea.
But hey, it's good to have you back.
Oh.
Hmm.
Okay.
Mm hmm.
So uh Roland: Well, I'm gonna go ahead and file Ray's Ham and Clam Bake in the t'won't happen pile.
Hmm.
After a glud of unasinous ideas put forth today, the room is suddenly bombilating with anticipation.
Can we feel that?
It's almost as though we're building towards some sort of inevitable climax.
All right, well, we have one here called Untitled Moira Rose Project.
I'd like us all to close our eyes, and picture 3 to 5 hundred acres of carefully-manicured lawn.
Accessorized with sculptures from some of the world's most-significant cultural contributors.
On your left, a whimsical gestalt by David Von Schlegell.
On your right, a playful abstract by Isamu Noguchi.
Dead ahead, your senses have just been affronted by a Magdalena Abakanowicz.
Now, imagine an even more splendacious art park, in your very own backyard!
Council, I humbly present Rosewood.
Uh yeah, I gotta say, you're not gonna find a bigger Noguchi-head than me, but I think I speak for everyone here when I say, good luck on getting your mitts on a Von Schlegell!
Am I right, guys?
I think we need to be more realistic about what we can pull off.
And who's to say what we can pull off?
I recently heard of a small town in Scotland, no bigger than a thimble, that is making millions from a week-long singles fest.
Now, if an idea as simple as that can work for a people as infamously disorganized as the Scotch, surely we can aspire to something of equal scale.
Now there's an idea.
Thank you!
Ronnie's on board with Rosewood.
No, I'm not!
I like the singles fest.
No, no, that was merely an example of how Rosewood would similarly put us on the map.
Moira, let's stuff Rosewood in a drawer for right now.
I like this singles idea.
- No.
- Single people is what this town needs!
Loose wallets, loose inhibitions, everything's just really loose.
I vote for singles week.
All in favour of singles week?
Aye!
- Okay.
-  -  -   By all means, feel free to use the printer - whenever you like.
- Thank you.
Just um, receipt for business cards that I ordered.
Hmm.
And a few pages of temporary letterhead.
And um, a list of Buzzfeed's most motivational quotes for girl bosses under 30.
I'm gonna do something uncharacteristic, and ask your advice.
Is there something off about the way that I look?
Did someone mention the posture thing?
- What?
- What is the utility shirts?
No.
No, okay, um, well you should probably just go ahead and tell me what you meant then.
Yeah.
Um, so your Dad got me a suitcase of makeup.
No, no.
Hmm.
And he suggested that I wear it every day.
So, I'm having a really hard time not taking that personally.
Here's the thing you should know about my Dad, sweetest little guy, gives the worst gifts.
Okay, well that makes me feel a little better.
Like he built David a basketball court for his Bar Mitzvah.
- Oh boy, okay.
- Mm hmm.
And unfortunately, the only way to like, train it out of him, is to show him just how wrong the gift is.
Like, David forced us to watch him shoot at a basket for 10 minutes, until the ball hit the rim, and then bounced back in his face.
But it actually worked out perfectly, because all David really wanted for his Bar Mitzvah, was a nose job.
They took the court down the next day.
Huh.
Oh, and also, he gave me a diamond tennis bracelet for my Sweet 16.
- That's bad.
- I know.
You know what, I'm probably good to finish this up, - Okay.
- if you wanna go for lunch.
- What?
- I don't know, you tell me.
I just did.
I'm happy to finish doing the creams, I I don't think it's a two-person job.
Okay, so you're just gonna stay here and not have lunch then, or are we going in shifts?
I don't know, David, I'm just trying to be professional here, okay?
Think this is gonna take a minute to get used to.
I don't want to get used to this!
I don't wanna pretend like we're co-workers.
We are co-workers.
Okay, I just liked it better when we were more than that.
David, I'm just trying to go off of what you wanted.
You wouldn't let me finish telling you what I wanted!
I was ready to get back together days ago!
- What?
- Yes.
Then why didn't we?
I've never been in this situation before.
Where someone's been so nice to me.
And generous.
I'm sorry, were you holding back on talking to me because you were getting gifts?
I was very upset, and confused.
So upset, that I barely finished the chocolates.
David, this wasn't meant to be some Advent calendar of apologies, it was like an olive branch to get you to talk to me.
I just, I guess, didn't know, how many olive branches you were planning on extending.
- Ideally, one!
- Okay, well now I know.
Yeah, and now I know, that while I was torturing myself, you were sitting at home, just opening gifts.
- I see you like the bracelet.
- Love the bracelet, thank you.
Um, does this mean that we are back ?
You know what, I feel like now maybe I deserve an olive branch, or two?
Okay, I understand that.
What if I gave you back some of the olive branches that you gave to me?
I was lying about the chocolates, I ate them all.
But I'm sure there are some flowers that are still alive.
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Mmhmm?
I'm gonna go to lunch, and you're gonna sit here, and think about what you've done.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, while you're at lunch, can you get me some lunch?
- Unbelievable.
-  - Johnny: Stevie?
-  Where's my Employee of the Month?
What's up?
Wow!
Look at you!
Yeah, used some of that makeup you gave me.
- Oh, is that what it is?
- Mmhmm.
Ah, I thought it was the shoes.
You know, something about this feels really right.
Hmm.
I can't believe that I didn't think to buy all this for myself!
So, I'm happy to man the desk for you this afternoon, if you've got stuff to do.
Oh, no, no, I I can keep working here.
No, Mr. Rose, I insist.
I feel like I'm long overdue for some quality, like, face time with the guests.
Oh, okay, well if that's what you feel.
You know what the great thing about this is?
Right after work, I can do go a quick shift over at Bazonga's Gentleman's Lounge.
All right, I'm getting the hint.
Hint?
What hint?
Look, Stevie, I'm not necessarily known for my gift-giving skills, but Arlene down at the store said this is what all the young locals are buying, and I No, I really appreciate the gift, but let's just agree that going forward, we don't need gifts to express our mutual appreciation.
Understood.
Well, if you don't mind, I'm gonna step outside.
I'm getting flashbacks of David attempting a 3-pointer.
- Ooh.
-  Moira: Alexis?
Oh, there you are!
What a delightful little home office you've created for yourself.
Thank you.
Succulents, and all!
You might be interested to know that Council has made a decision.
So they chose your idea, then?
I wouldn't let them have it.
Not until they accepted my demand, which was to employ the services of the CEO and Founder of Alexis Rose - whatever you called it- as part of my advisory team.
- What?
- Hmm.
Really?
Okay, I'm shocked.
Thank you!
No, Alexis, thank you!
Okay, so what's the project?
Hmm, well we landed on a one-of-a-kind event to celebrate and congregate those who happen to be unattached, uh, in the hopes of facilitating interpersonal connections.
Sorry, so like, a singles event, then?
That word is now considered derogatory.
I believe they prefer to be called independents.
So you stole my idea, took it to Council, and claimed it as your own?
Alexis, now is not the time for pettifogging!
Ugh!
Singles Week just happened to be the idea that received a lot of traction.
Singles Week?
I was pitching a Singles Night.
No.
No, no, no, you specifically referenced a small shire in Scotland Ireland!
that had a very lucrative week-long singles event.
No, that is where I got the idea for singles night.
I was proposing like, a matchmaking event at the cafÃ©.
Well then, I took your little germ of an idea, and I fertilized it to fruition.
Okay, okay, I literally started my company today.
Do you know how much work this is gonna be?
Okay, we will be Co-Chairs, and I will be charging Council my full fee.
Starting to get keyed up about this prospect of a mother-daughter power team.
Modern day Judy and Lorna.
I don't know who that is.
Oh my god.
Okay, David, well I'm gonna go to dinner, and if you wanted to join me, and pay for it, that could be a start.
Yeah, maybe I could do that.
Uh, I just think I have something to do first, so What is this?
Consider this my olive branch.
I call you when I need you, my heart's on fire You come to me, come to me wild and wired Oh, you come to me Give me everything I need Give me a life time of promises And a world of dreams You speak the language of love Like you know what it means Mm, and it can't be wrong Take my heart and make it strong, baby You know people can see you, right?
You're simply the best Better than all the rest Better than anyone Anyone I ever met Ooh I'm stuck on your heart I hang on every word you say Oh, tear us apart, no, no, no Baby, I would rather be dead Each time you leave me I start losing control You're walking away with my heart and my soul I can feel you even when I'm alone Oh, baby, don't let go
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1    Hi, Jocelyn.
Is everything okay?
- Yeah.
Why?
- Um, I love your pajama set.
Thank you.
It's been a hectic morning, David, I'm not gonna lie.
Well, I lit a patchouli candle, so hopefully it'll calm your chi.
Yeah, well, I didn't get much sleep last night.
Somebody decided to do a synchronized swimming routine at 2am.
- Oh no.
- Yeah, so long night.
And then followed by the news that my sister can't drive into town to host my baby shower!
Oh.
Something to do with her husband's heart.
Oh, well, hope it clears itself up.
Yeah, well, it won't.
That's the problem.
- Well, you never know.
- Well, I do.
Which is why I ask you to then point this pregnant lady towards your party-theme section, because it seems as though I am throwing my own baby shower!
Sounds very dark.
Um, we actually don't have a party section, so - Just a streamer, David, just - Okay, yeah.
There's a basket on the other side, I think.
Down below.
Hmm.
It's times like this I wish I had your eye for decorating and party planning.
Roland's been trying to help me, offered off his movie posters, you know, but I just don't think that "The Pelican Brief" is festive enough for a baby shower.
Well, I'd have to agree.
Yeah, well, if only there was someone like you who could help me organize this.
Very kind of you to say.
Yeah, I mean, somebody like you, or you.
Who would just help me organize this, before I snap!
Well, I'm sure I could help you out.
David!
Oh my goodness!
Are you sure?
I don't want you to feel like you have to do this.
- Are you sure about that?
-  Well, it is tonight, so I suppose you better uh, get to work!
- Tonight?
- Yes.
Okay, will the store be promoted, at least, at this event?
- Absolutely!
- And what is the venue?
- My house!
And are we married to that venue?
- Yes!
- Okay.
- Thank you, David.
-  What just happened?
Okay, so I was thinking as incentive for our singles, we could do like, a lonely heart's special.
So 50% discount for those singles dining alone.
Okay um, but wouldn't it make more sense to offer a discount for people not dining alone?
But it's Singles Week though, is the thing.
Right.
Um, but if the point of Singles Week is to get matched up, then why not offer a discount for singles who eat together?
Okay, I have a better idea.
A 2-for-1 discount for 2 singles eating together.
That's it, that's the winner.
Yay!
Oh my god, Alexis?
Oh my god, Klaire!
Oh my guys, I know this girl!
Babe!
Hi!
Oh my god, what are you doing here?
- Oh.
- Okay, so me, Albany, Jitney, and Candy, we just needed to get away from the city for a bit, and so Vice put out this guide to the most random cities in North America, and we were like, lets him 'em.
Oh my god, that sounds so random.
Oh my god.
This is where you live, isn't it?
I'm so sorry I didn't put that together, it's like I completely forgot about you.
Oh my god, no, babe, please, it's like - it's so good to see you.
- I know.
So like, it was two weeks straight of work at the agency, so we just got in the car, and we drove.
You know how it gets, it's like uh-uh-uh.
- Can I get you something?
- Stop.
Oh my god, I'm obsessed with your look.
You look just like a small-town waitress!
Beep!
- Thanks.
- Actually you know what  I would love like a hot water, but if you could just let it sit so it cools, I just need to know that it was once hot.
- Sorry, I'm the worst.
-  Thank you.
Like nothing's really changed, am I right?
- Yeah.
- Ugh, okay, babe, sit down.
Tell me about you.
Like, what have you even been doing?
- Oh my god.
- Oh my god!
Like, so much.
Okay, love that, girl.
Tell me.
Tell me everything.
Um, okay, so I graduated high school.
- Uh huh.
- Got my certificate.
Um, I opened my own PR firm, and I'm actually organizing this little event, so Okay.
We really have to get you outta here.
What?
You know what, you need to join us tonight.
We're gonna go to some random bar, for some random drinks.
Hmm.
Hundred percent.
No but like, actually come though, okay?
I'm serious.
I could use a distraction.
Albany literally makes me wanna kill myself.
- Anyway, I should go.
-  Please tell me I'm gonna see you tonight.
Okay, here is your not-so-hot water.
Sweetie, no, I didn't order that.
- See you tonight, babe.
- Hm.
See you tonight, babe.
See you tonight, babe.
Hm.
Hm.
Albany, I was sitting there!
Well, it's good of you to come with me, John.
Well, not a problem, Sweetheart.
Stevie was thrilled to be left looking after the motel with Roland.
Of course your accompanying me today would have nothing to do with any concerns you may have, about me being left alone in a room teeming with eligible bachelors?
I have no concerns about you, Moira, you can handle yourself.
But if you ever unleash your feminine wiles on those bachelors, they wouldn't know what hit them.
Hmm.
- Hi.
Thanks for coming.
I'm Ricki.
- Johnny, and this is - Moira.
I'm the lead intimacy facilitator here at MADLY, and I am so thrilled that you would choose me as a consultant for your Singles Week.
As are we, Ricki.
I'm sure you don't get a great many auditors here, at the group but, we would just love a little hand-held tour to see what it is you do.
Can I ask what MADLY stands for?
Mature Adults Dating Lovers, Yes!
We pride ourselves on our ability to stimulate soulful exchanges between all of our singles.
And, I'm confident that we're going to be able to find superlative matches for both of you.
Oh dear.
Oh!
Bit of a misunderstanding, here.
We're-we're looking to observe your event, for research.
Well, we could peek in on the experience like group voyeurs, but it would be much more educational for both of you if you would let me immerse you in it.
And what would this immersion process entail?
Today's activity is called "A Lock and Key".
Our ladies get the keys.
Our men get the locks.
And then we spend an hour mingling, trying to find that perfect fit.
Well, lucky for us, this lock has already found its key.
You'd be surprised.
Would I?
John?
Could be fun.
And I know who I'll be leaving with.
All right, let's give it a try!
Wonderful.
I just have to ask, before the event, will you grant me access to your most intimate sounds?
No.
But we'll play the game.
David: Okay, and could that be delivered by tonight?
Okay, perfect.
All right, thank you very much.
Hi.
- What's goin' on?
Well, um, Jocelyn came in here this morning looking like Adam Sandler on a red carpet.
Poor thing is planning her own baby shower, so I volunteered to help.
Wow.
That's very generous of you.
Yeah, I thought it could be a good opportunity to promote the store.
So, Heather's supplying some of her cheeses, not at cost, but she's giving us a deal, and I thought we could bring some wine from the store, and Colleen's express-shipping a branzino, so.
Sounding a bit expensive, David.
Well, we haven't talked budget yet, but I'm assuming that Jocelyn's wanting to spend some money on her baby shower.
I'm assuming that Jocelyn's planning on spending no money - on her baby shower.
- Whadda ya mean?
Well, typically the person who throws the shower, pays for the shower.
Well, that wasn't part of the agreement.
Well, what did you say to her?
- I told her I'd take care of it.
- Ah!
She basically forced me into it!
This isn't even her first baby!
Oh, so it's more of a sprinkle, then.
What the hell is a sprinkle?
No, it's like a shower, but for your second kid.
It's not a full shower, it's like a sprinkle.
That is the stupidest  thing I have ever heard.
Uh, also booze and fish, not ideal for a pregnant woman.
Yeah, well, she's one person, and everyone knows you don't plan a whole party around one person.
Maybe you do, if the party is for her.
Says who?
Fine!
Worst case scenario, she grazes at the soft cheese station.
Are you sure that she can eat that?
This is why I hate babies!
Klaire!
Oh my god, Lex!
Are you like, stalking me, or something?
- Um, actually I, um - Oh my god, I'm kidding.
But seriously, like what are you doing here?
Um, I'm just like crashing here.
- Oh.
- Temporarily, obviously.
Are um, are you guys staying here?
Oh my god!
Funny.
No.
No.
We have Airstreams up the road, but we saw this sign, and we thought it was so random.
Yeah.
Oh my god!
I almost totally forgot!
I have a job for you.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
I just like, I can't talk about it around Albany, because she needs to get fired first, so basically the job is yours, if you want it.
It's a junior PR position, but you could totally climb the ladder.
Look, take your time, just let me know by tomorrow.
By tomorrow?
Hm, yeah, we're gonna get a super early start, so make sure you find me before 2 pm.
Oh wow, okay.
It's just like, all happening so fast, 'cause I'd have to like, pack, and find a place to stay.
Oh my god, don't even worry about that.
You can totally stay at my dad's place.
He hasn't lived there for like 15 years.
I think he started a new family, or something.
- Oh.
- So it would be you, and my dad's ex-wife.
But don't worry about her, she's two years younger than - us, and like super chill.
- Okay.
Anyway, I'm gonna call it on this Instasesh, but I'll let you know what bar we hit up tonight.
Okay, actually, there's only one.
Oh, well that's great, because I feel like all I do every night is just argue with Albany about where to go.
Like the poor thing doesn't understand that like, literally, no one even wanted her here in the first place.
- Ooh.
- I can't wait to fire her.
I'm her best friend.
- Okay, here's my card.
- Yes.
Let me know about the job.
Okay, yes.
That sounds like chillin'.
- I will definitely uh, let you know!
- Okay.
Hey, pack your bags, bitch!
You're getting' out!
It's funny, because before my dear Gloria passed, she told me her dying wish was for me to move on.
Ah, did she?
I know you're gonna find this hard to believe, but she predicted that I would meet a woman with shoulder-length blonde hair, and red lipstick.
- Telepathic, was she?
- And tremendously specific!
If I may leave you with a bit of advice, I would wait until much later in the relationship before mentioning any of the things you just mentioned to me.
Okay?
Uh, wait, you haven't even tried your key.
Uh, it won't fit.
Johnny: Now, ask me when the last time the motel sold out, before I showed up?
- Never!
Zero!
Didn't happen.
-  Must take a special touch.
Well, call it what you will, Charlene.
Maybe I'll spend the night sometime.
At the motel, I mean.
Oh, oh, oh.
-  - Moira!
You should really keep looking for your perfect match.
For research.
Or love.
Mhmm.
Radio Announcer: Tomorrow, more sunshine Jocelyn: Welcome, boys!
I can't thank you enough for jumping in like this!
Oh, it's our pleasure.
Okay, um, so what's going on here?
I thought I would what I could to get a jumpstart on the decorations.
Here's the thing, Jocelyn, when you asked me to throw this event, you were essentially handing over creative control.
Considering our name is gonna be all over this, I think it's important to streamline the aesthetic direction we're taking for tonight.
Okay, well I guess I could move some of the balloons?
That could be good.
Yeah, we could move those.
Maybe to the garbage?
We're also gonna need to drop-cloth the interiors.
Roland: Okay, guys!
Where do you want me to hang the pinata?
I'm sorry, is that supposed to be a baby?
Yeah, it's pretty realistic, isn't it?
I got it at the dollar store in Elmdale.
I didn't even have to pay for it, honey.
They just gave it to me.
Yeah, don't think we can smash a baby - with a stick tonight, but - It's not a real baby, Dave.
The fact that you got it from the dollar store does make me wary of what's gonna fall out of it, though?
Don't worry, Rolly, we're still gonna play the diaper game.
Ah, good!
Hi!
What's the diaper game?
Oh my gosh, it is so fun!
We played it at Mutt's baby shower!
Basically, you melt different chocolate bars into different diapers, and then people take turns guessing Gonna stop you right there.
I will literally do anything for us to not play that game.
Well, I'm getting nervous, because we're gonna need some sort of entertainment, David.
Well then, I will come up with some games that don't involve sniffing a diaper.
- You don't just sniff it.
- No.
You don't.
Oh my god.
Hey, Jocelyn, why don't you, why don't you get ready, get changed, and we'll take good care of the place.
I am ready.
And you look great, so, do you wanna have a seat?
Relax?
Mm hmm.
Okay, is this vase movable?
Uh, no, that there is grandpa's ashes, and no, you cannot move it, it's bolted down.
There's been a lot of urn thefts lately.
I'll tell ya what, I will get my ratchet, and see what I can do for ya, okay?
You hold baby.
- All right.
- Go ahead.
Was this a mistake?
Oh, probably, but you know, we're here now, you know.
Yup.
Where do I put this  thing?
No?
Hello.
And just when I thought I'd tried every lock.
- You are?
- Rene.
I work in ad sales and can drive at night.
Ah.
I know that sounds like an odd thing to mention, but it does separate me from the crowd.
Pardonnez-moi, senor Rene.
Okay, Moira, let's go.
Charlene's getting a little tipsy, and things are starting to turn.
Hm, well I just have one more lock to try, John, so Rene, I'll be gentle.
Oh, look at that!
It seems to be jammed.
Can you, Rene?
Sure.
Okay, Moira, I think we're done here.
Have we finally found our match?
Yes, we have, but here, locks sadly are defective.
You're um getting a bit of neck burn.
Oh.
Well, I didn't have any problem with mine.
Often times in these situations, I ask a participant to go within, and to reflect why she might be having trouble connecting.
Connecting is my livelihood.
No, it's these discount locks.
I've tried every other one.
Ooh!
You know what, John?
You're right, we should go.
Jocelyn has that bebe thing.
Rene, pleasure as always.
You know, I have to say, I had a lot of apprehension when I came here.
- Let's not dally, dear.
- What's that?
Here you go.
Rene, Shirley needs a ride home.
Can you still drive at night?
Sure.
-  -  Hey, I'm heading out!
Hmm.
Okay, now this game is called sleepy mommy.
Jocelyn's sitting on the couch, she's our sleepy mommy.
Now mommy's had a very hard day with baby, and needs a bit of a break.
And that's where we come in.
We're each gonna take turns popping pills into mommy's mouth.
Now unfortunately, these are breath mints, we couldn't afford actual benzo's, but the person that does get the most tranqs into mommy's mouth, will walk away with whatever's left of the soft cheese station.
- Johnny: I'll go!
- Okay.
Boy, these have a bit more weight to them than the usual pills.
Well, you know, Johnny, that weight might actually work in your favour if you take into consideration the humidity in here.
Wow, well, thank you, Roland.
Okay, just relax.
There.
Oh!
All: Oh!
David, why does this game feel vaguely familiar?
You invented it.
We played it a lot growing up.
Oh!
I can't remember playing.
That's because we got very good at it.
I remember Alexis got on in from across the room once.
All: Oh!
I've gotta hand it to ya, David, it's a little unconventional, but people seem to be gettin' really into this.
Roland: Hey, Dave?
Do I get an extra point if I can bounce one of her forehead?
Yeah, we need some clarity on the point system, David, because I've landed three in Jocelyn's bangs, and that's gotta count for something.
- Or nothing.
- Ugh.
- Okay.
That's not fair.
- Okay.
On three, try this together,  1, 2, 3.
All: Oh!
Yeah!
So like, she's telling me that she's going to Mexico, and I'm like, if you're not going to Tulum, then like where the hell are you even going?
- You know what I'm saying?
- So where is she going?
- Ugh, god.
Cabo.
- Oh my god, poor thing.
I know, right?
Like, what does she wanna go smoke a blunt with Pitbull?
- Ugh, probably not.
-  Um, anyway, can I talk to you for a sec, Klaire?
Oh yeah, sure.
Wassup?
- Okay, so I've been thinking about it.
- Hmm.
And as much as I appreciate the offer, um, I think for the next little while, I should just stay here.
I'm sorry, reset.
What are we talking about?
Um, the job that you offered at your dad's friend's company?
- The junior publicist?
- Oh.
I just don't think that I can leave here yet.
Oh, yeah, sure, you do your bit.
I'm always here for you.
Sorry, I was like, what are we even talking about.
So like, Albany just put down her dad's black card, so shots on him.
It's the least that she can do because she didn't come through with the party favors.
Breaking news, we still  hate her.
Anyway, do you want a shot or not?
It's Albany's birthday.
Um, I don't think that I can.
I have this other thing that I need to go to.
Okay, yeah, cool.
Hey, well text me later.
All right?
We can totally ditch this thing and we don't have to tell Albany, if that's what's holding you back?
- Will do.
- Okay.
Oh and Lex, it was so good to see you.
Really, it's been too long.
We can't let this happen again.
It won't.
Why do you guys have drinks, and I don't?
Hmm?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
David, Stevie is just now opening the Rose Apothecary products we ordered for the motel.
Okay, good, you're welcome.
Well, it would be good if the order had arrived when it was supposed to arrive, last week.
All right, so it got held up.
What possible difference could one week make?
We made sure to order those products - in time for the rollout.
- What rollout?
The Rosebud Motel rollout.
New name, new branding, flowers in all the rooms.
New custom towels, all part of the rollout.
- Um, who taught you rollout?
- May have been me.
Sorry.
You know, other than your little blunder, it would've been a flawless rollout.
Okay, you really need to stop saying rollout.
David, delivery dates are important, when it comes to client loyalty.
Okay, do I need to remind you that I'm the one doing you the favour?
Accessorizing motel bathrooms is not what I would call on-brand for the store.
So, if you would like to pull the account, you can pull the account.
Well I can't pull the account, because it's part of the rollout.
So, I may be looking elsewhere when it comes time for the pop-out store.
Okay.
He meant pop-up store, right?
Honestly, David, it took him like 2 weeks - to learn rollout, so -  It's just that we don't want people adopting sad dogs.
You know, like singles are sad enough, so we want the puppies to be happy, and fun, and flirty.
Yeah, I got that note in your email, uh, but, as you know, these are rescue dogs so it's kinda hard to guarantee fun.
She's a little cutie!
That's actually a he, and I think he might already be spoken for?
But the event's like a week away.
I know, I just, I happened to show some of these little rascals to Heather, and, and she saw this guy, and wanted to adopt him.
So, we're just kind of in the process of making that happen, -  - for her.
- Hmm.
Wow, love that for her.
- Moira: Alexis?
Oh, Theodore, back for another meeting of the animals, I see.
Hello, Mrs. Rose.
You know you two are lovely little freaks.
In this digital day of discontented disconnection, you two still manage to do things face-to-face, like people from before your time.
Hmm.
We were just finishing up.
Oh, I'll-I'll just see you at the volunteers' meeting, then?
Um, you know what, you don't have to come to that.
But, thank you for all of your help with this.
Okay, uh, okay sure.
Well, let me know if you need anything else.
- You got my number, obviously.
- Yes, I do, thank you.
- Bye, Mrs. Rose.
- Bye.
See you again soon, I'm sure.
Safe to say our animal-loving singles will be well placated.
Can I help you with something?
Yes!
Yes.
That nudnick at the curling rink just informed me that they'll no longer be able to accommodate our Lover's Messy Sloppy Joe Eat-a-Thon.
I'm afraid you have to secure us another venue.
Okay, well, can't you do it?
N alas!
Your co-chair will be busy getting herself out of jury duty today.
Okay, then I will just add that to the immense list of things that I have to do this morning.
Alexis, you know me, I'm not one to overstep, But, perhaps you might be able to strike a few more to-do's off that list if you and Ted spend a little less time fussing over this canine auction.
It's a puppy adoption, and we're done.
Planning.
So, thank you.
- Hey.
Wow!
Looking very nice, Stevie.
Yeah, thanks, except I think I have to go home now.
Really?
What's going on?
Uh, nothing to be concerned about, just this.
Oh my god!
What happened?
I don't know it's like an allergic reaction or something.
Did we change our laundry detergent?
No, what have you been doing differently?
Nothing, just rolling things out, like you asked me to.
Could be, could be an insect bite.
It's all the way up my arms.
Well, Stevie, stop!
What are you doing?
Uh I know it's for the guests, but it's like really good stuff, and this is extra.
How long have you been using that?
This morning.
Before or after your arm started itching?
After, definitely after.
Oh, okay.
I mean, I might've tried a little bit when I was unpacking the box, but - my skin gets real dry in here.
- It's the lotion.
What?
David's lotion is giving you the rash!
No, I don't think it's the lotion.
And you know what?
I'm not surprised!
Because he gets a lot of this stuff from farms, and who knows where, and you don't know what's in these natural products!
Stevie, why do you keep doing that?
I don't know, okay!
It might be causing the rash, but it's also the only thing that's making it feel better.
Okay, well we have to now go and see David.
No, I think it's a better idea that I just go home.
After we handle this!
This is the last thing we need in the middle of a rollout!
Okay, if I could just get everyone to be, like, quiet for a minute?
-  - C-help.
Okay.
Hey!
Hey.
Um, welcome to the first official volunteer meeting.
I, of course, am your co-chair, Alexis Rose.
Um, I think this is gonna be a very fun week.
But, as of right now, it's less than ideal.
Um, I don't wanna add to anyone's stress, but we just lost the curling club.
-  Oh - Bottom line, we need a new venue, so if everyone can just like, ask around?
Please.
Mutt: I might have a place.
Oh my god!
Okay, um, everyone take a Hot 5.
And oh, for those of you asking about the t-shirts, yes, they are supposed to be tight.
This is Singles Week, everyone is fair game.
Okay?
- Hi!
- Hi.
What are you doing back?
Oh well, I uh, I don't know if you heard, but I'm gonna have a little brother soon, - so yeah, I couldn't miss that.
- Um, yes, congratulations.
And, are you serious about having a venue for me?
Because that would be amazing.
Happy to loan out the barn, - if it can be cleaned up in time.
- What happened?
Oh, I asked a friend of mine to keep an eye on it while I was away, and musta slipped her mind.
It didn't slip my mind, I just like, didn't go.
Is it bad?
Yeah, a nice little home for a family of raccoons.
I had to evict them, though, and they didn't go quietly.
Okay.
You are literally saving my life right now.
I feel like I should help you clean, or like, water the plants, or something.
I won't turn down the help, but you don't have to worry about the plants, they are very, very dead.
Mutt, you're making me feel partially responsible.
Moira Rose.
Moira!
Moira!
Jocelyn, I see you've been lassoed into the judicial process as well.
Finally!
I'm surprised to see you here, though.
I know, right?
You've served so many times already!
I mean you had to miss the Jazzagals Luau Luncheon because of that hung jury, and then before that, you and Johnny got caught in that criminal trial and couldn't make it to the Seafood Potluck.
Mmhmm.
What can I say?
I'm a stand-out in the jury box.
But shame on them for summoning a woman in your condition.
Oh no, I've been waiting for this moment.
Apparently, if they call your number, you get to stand in front of a judge!
I feel like I'm on "The Voice"!
Ooh, as seductive as that sounds, no thank you.
With Singles Week just around the corner, my services are desperately needed elsewhere.
- Man: Number 23!
- Oh my god!
That's me!
Number 40, number 75!
Uh oh, that's me.
Jocelyn, you're about to witness a master class in judicatory persuasion.
Hello?
-  - Hello?
No one at the counter!
Who runs a business like this?
Anyone could just walk in here and shoplift.
Okay, nobody's just walking in here and shoplifting.
David!
Your face!
I know my face!
I know my face!
It's a it's a heat rash or something!
I look like the Phantom of the Opera!
Well, you can't greet customers with that face!
You don't think I know that?
I don't have much choice!
Patrick's at some business seminar, I don't really know, because I wasn't really listening.
Stevie, show him your arms.
- Thought you'd never ask!
- Oh my god!
What happened to your arms?
Same thing that happened to your face!
- What?
- Your Dad thinks it's your moisturizer.
Okay, that's impossible.
I've been using this moisturizer - every day for 3 months.
- Oh.
Although, this is a new batch.
And we've already sold half the stock.
Oh my god!
See?
I knew it!
David, we have a problem.
We have a big problem.
You could be sued!
- What?
- For retail negligence.
Stevie, show him your arms again.
- I don't want to show him my arms.
- I don't wanna see her arms again.
You realize you're gonna have to talk to Patrick and tell him that you two are gonna have to take a bit of a breather when it comes to - Ew!
- You know, could be contagious.
- Oh my god!
- Yeah, and here you were this morning, acting like you were doing us a favour with the rollout.
Okay, this is one of our best-selling products.
Well, we're gonna have to roll it back in.
And stop touching your face!
You stop touching your face!
Alexis: Okay, this is definitely smaller than the curling rink.
Well, it sounds like you've been really busy - puttin' this thing together.
- Yeah.
What's happened since you and Tallahassee left on your pine-cone journey?
It's uh, Tennessee, and I'm pretty sure you know that, - and that ended a while ago.
- Oh no!
I totally thought she was like, the one for you.
We called it off the day we arrived.
She's married to Moonshine now, the owner of the cone form.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That trip was a disaster.
Compass broke halfway there, we ended up following a star for 2 days.
Anyway, by the time we got there, we sat down and uh, spoke our truths.
Pretty freeing.
That day I picked 700 cones!
Hmm, is that like a lot of cones?
Well, Moonshine and his daughter, Petal, said it was the biggest one-day haul they'd ever seen.
They gave me the Cone of Achievement, which allowed me to take 2 showers that week.
- Speaking of showers, - Ugh!
No!
This can't happen, I have like 50 zillion things to do today.
Ooh, well, if only helping me clean was one of 'em.
Ugh!
I can crack open a bottle of cone wine?
Feeling risky?
Ugh, fine.
Um, no.
Uh fine.
No.
Okay, but um, like just one.
Welcome to jury selection.
The case you would be asked to decide is a misdemeanor embezzlement charge levied by the owners of Tom and Marge's Magic and Fun Shop, against their business manager, Mr. Albert Percy.
Embezzlement, no, no, no, no.
I've seen this movie before.
It is your responsibility to notify the court of anything you've seen or heard, that may impact on your ability to be a fair and impartial juror.
Moira, this sounds like what happened to your family.
- This could be your out.
- Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
A man needs to be brought to justice.
Yeah.
So we're back to the generic brand.
-  - Roland: Well gang, Just about time for me to clock out.
I gotta tell you two, this timesheet you have is really complicated.
By the time I finished filling it out, I was already into overtime.
So do you guys have an overtime sheet I can fill out?
Kinda busy in here, Roland.
Whoa.
Stevie!
Geez!
Yowzer!
It's just a reaction to David's moisturizer.
Well, boy, leave it to Stevie to get a rash from a moisturizer when she's sitting right - next to poison oak.
- What poison oak?
Excuse me?
Well, right here.
It's uh - poison oak in that vase there.
- What?
Where did you get those flowers, Mr. Rose?
Well, I talked to a few florists, and then I decided it was more authentic and economical, if I just went out back and picked some.
Uh, correct me if I'm wrong here, Johnny, but I don't think poison oak is that expensive.
I didn't know it was poison oak!
- Mmhmm.
- Wait a second, if you picked them, then how come you don't have the rash?
Well, I was wearing gardening gloves.
Okay, look, I'd love to stand around and help you guys, but I'm already sneaking into double overtime here, so, I'm off.
So someone's gonna have to tell David before he takes it all back.
No offense, Mr. Rose, but I'm pretty sure that someone is not going to be me.
Ma'am, can you assure my client and the Court, that you would, to the best of your ability, uphold the law if selected for jury duty?
Affirmative.
Mmhmm.
Do you have any life experiences similar to the facts of this case, that might affect your judgment?
Well, there was that summer that Jimmy Smits stole my heart on stage in a workshop-only production of "An Officer and a Gentleman".
I suppose that might be called emotional embezzlement?
- So your answer is no.
- To what?
Juror 75, you were asked if you had any personal conflicts that might affect your judgments of this case.
I don't know these people.
I don't know these people.
The fact that my own world was ripped out from under me, by someone like this prick of a prestidigitator?
I should think would help the court in the quest - to make a fair judgment.
-  - May I approach the bench, please?
- No, you may not.
The Court thanks and excuses Prospective Juror 75.
Jocelyn, for the sake of that woman, you must push for the maximum sentence!
- Your Honor!
- Hold on.
You two know each other?
Not really, we just got to talking on the way in.
I I wouldn't say we were close.
All right, I'm dismissing both Juror 75 and Juror 23.
Mother .
This is the farthest I've ever gone!
It sounds like it's actually raining harder.
So just take the day off, like old time's sake.
Um, I am a college graduate, Mutt.
Singles Week is not community service, it's actually very important to me.
And I respect that.
So, will you be participating in Singles Week?
Ugh.
No, I'm trying to like, learn from my mistakes before making any new ones.
Think it's funny, you bringing people together, - and, here we are, still single.
- Hmm.
- Makes you wonder if it's us?
-  - What is happening?
- I don't know, I just thought we were here, it's raining, felt like nothing had changed.
Yeah, I can see how you would make that leap, but things have changed for me.
That's cool.
We did have some fun in here, though.
Yeah, we did.
You were quite the heartbreaker.
Yeah.
Not like, super proud of that, but Um, so when you and Tallahassee had your talk, you said it was freeing.
Saying something you've kept hidden, out loud?
Yeah, it was pretty freeing.
Though, in our case, it was mostly swears and we didn't talk for a week, but it was worth it in the end.
Who knows where I'd be right now if I just didn't tell her how I felt.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I think I need to leave.
It's still raining!
Yeah, I know, I know, there's um, there's like something I need to do.
But thank you for the talk, and for finishing up cleaning, because I'm obviously not gonna help with that.
You're a good one, Mutt.
- Okay, bye.
-  Okay, well I don't know what to tell you, Brenda, I'm rashy!
Rashy!
Yeah, the batch must be contaminated or something, it's like, some, some cream-borne virus!
Yes, it's the cream.
My skin is normally fresh, and dewy, and blemish-free.
Well, I've already sold half the stock!
-  - Okay, can you hold for a sec?
-  - What now?
Oh, I'm just dropping by, you know.
Oh, place looks great, really uh, really shaping up.
Yeah, I'm just on the phone with the vendor that sold us the infectious moisturizer, so, Well, does the vendor have a sense of humor, because this is a good one!
Remember the conversation we were having this morning about you know, the rash?
Well, it turns out it wasn't the moisturizer, it was poison oak.
Brenda, can I call you back?
You know, it seems poison oak accidentally found its way into the floral arrangements at the motel.
How did that happen?
I don't know.
I don't know how it happened.
I think someone, someone must've thought it was a beautiful plant.
Mmhmm.
You did this, didn't you?
Well you, yourself must've thought it was a pretty flower, or you wouldn't have put your whole face in it!
I'm sorry for touching my nose to a flower!
I just went all Gordon Ramsey on one of my most important vendors!
I basically told her, her product was like a jar of Ebola!
So, this is uh, not a good time to talk about future orders.
We will be canceling your account.
Just be outgoing, be open, and show them your best self.
And don't worry, I'll be vetting everyone in advance.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How long have you been standing there?
Um, long enough.
Yeah, I was just giving them a little pup talk.
Okay, Ted, I have a few things to say, and I need you just to listen.
Okay, uh, is it about the puppies though, just because they're kinda fragile right now, so maybe we should go in the other room.
- It's not about the puppies.
- Oh, okay, good.
Okay.
So as you know, Singles Week has been taking up a lot of my time, um, because this could be like, a big step forward in my career, and generally speaking, this is like a very cute look for me.
- Okay.
- Okay not finished yet.
The problem is, I've been having um, a hard time focusing on this exciting career opportunity because my mind has been elsewhere.
Oh, I just assumed that's how you always work.
Thank you, Ted, but this is different.
I love you.
I'm in love with you.
And, I know I really don't have any right to say that to you.
And also, I know you're in a relationship, um, and I'm happy for you, I really am, I just feel like if I didn't tell you how I felt, I would literally go insane.
You're the sweetest man I've ever known.
And that's it.
Wow, I didn't I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything.
Um, but maybe I could take a puppy home for the night.
- You know I can't let you do that.
- Yeah, no.
That's no problem.
Um, I was just thinking if there was like, a particularly runty one, like Cindy, or like, no, no.
That's okay.
Okay, well, this is going to be a very successful event.
Like, really great.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1  Moira: Alexis?
Alexis, Alexis!
I just overheard three women with smokers' coughs talking about "Sex in the City".
The singles have arrived!
Why are you not wearing your t-shirt?
Darling, Mommy's delivering the keynote address.
There's going to be press and photographers there, I think it would be a tad declasse for the Chair of the event to be wearing a Volunteers t-shirt.
Mkay, I'm Co-Chair, and I'm wearing my t-shirt.
Well, love is definitely in the air!
- Motel at max capace all week long.
- Mm hmm.
I appreciate everything you do, Alexis, but I think it's best I carry the baton over the goal line.
-  - What's going on here?
Mom's basically trying to cut me out of Singles Week.
I am not cutting her out, John.
I'm merely trying to ensure an unruffled launch.
Do you remember the last time you and I chaired an event?
The Teenage Rosacea Ball at the St. Regis?
That was 15 years ago!
Well, that was a different time, Moira.
Alexis has been working on herself.
Yes, Alexis has been working very hard on herself.
She just closed a very important chapter of her life with Ted last week, and still she's putting everything she has into finding love for other people.
What exactly have you done?
Well I'll tell you what I'm about to do.
I'm about to swing by Jocelyn's and get the locks and keys for this morning's event.
You still haven't picked up the locks and keys?
- Ugh!
Yes, what?
Um, I just walked past three very raspy-voiced Miranda's outside, - so I think the singles are here.
- Ooh!
Johnny: Okay, with the 50% premium charge for Singles Week, I think we might be able to afford some of the bigger improvements we've been talking about.
Ooh, sorry guys.
- Roland?
- Roland's phone.
- Hey, Bob.
- Roland, hang up.
Yeah, uh, Johnny's tellin' me I gotta hang up.
Yes, they're both here, staring at me.
Johnny has that upset look on his face.
Yeah.
That's the perfect way to describe it, Bob.
- Mr. Rose.
- Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna put this on silent for the rest of the meeting, okay?
Do you know how to do that, Stevie?
Roland, with all that we have going on this week, we'll need your full attention.
Oh, relax, Johnny.
I'm here for ya.
Whadda ya need?
Um, maybe you could head out to Elmdale and go to the hardware store, and knock the first three things off this list.
That's no problem.
Sure.
And anything else you want, just let me know.
How 'bout a car wash?
Or maybe a brow trim for Johnny?
- Just the things on the list.
- Okay.
Don't worry about it.
I won't let ya guys down.
Ah!
Ah!
Ugh!
You been goin' to the gym, 'cause that looked effortless?
It's just a very awkwardly shaped box, but yes I have, and thank you for noticing.
So what, uh, what is this?
Um, this is a box of dog sweaters that Alexis has asked me to drop off at Ted's for the pet adoption thing for Singles Week.
So what's it doing here, then?
I was just wondering what your day was looking like?
I'm not dropping the box off for you.
Okay, I know, but it would just save me so much distress!
- Oh, are you in distress?
- Yes!
The whole situation with Alexis and Ted right now is very awkward and cringe-y.
Alexis told him she loved him.
Wow.
Well, good for her, it's it's not easy puttin' yourself out there like that.
Okay, sure.
I just think it'll be less awkward for all of us, especially considering Ted now knows that I know, that he knows, if you maybe took the box.
I'm not taking the box for you, David, I still have to unpack all of these products for Singles Week, that you bought.
Okay, then I guess I'll just, take the box and go, then.
- David?
- Yeah.
- Listen to me.
- Mm-hmm.
What you're doing is very brave.
- Mm-hmm.
- Very generous, okay?
And I don't wanna add more stress to your day, but I love you.
Okay, so so you just said that to me for the first time, knowing that it would make my day more stressful.
That's correct.
Because you know that I've never said that to anyone else, aside from my parents twice, and at a Mariah Carey concert, I know.
Yeah.
And I don't expect you to say it back to me, right now, you say it when you're ready.
Just felt right to me, in the moment.
You're my Mariah Carey.
Okay.
That compliment could bring me to tears, but I'm not gonna let it.
So I would like to thank you for all the wonderful things - that you said.
- Okay.
- Wanna get me a tea while you're out?
- Okay, I will get you a tea.
Um, would you mind just not looking at me while I take this box outta the room, 'cause I don't want you regretting any of the nice things that you just said to me?
Okay, look away, please.
Please.
- That went well.
-   -  - Moira: What?
- Hi, where are you?
- I'm on my way!
We've just encountered a bit of a roadblock, a hold-up, a minor issue.
Okay, you literally had one job to do.
- Jocelyn is in labor!
- Oh my god!
I know it's no one's fault.
I'm with her now, we're in the car.
Okay, so what am I supposed to do, here?
Well, has the press arrived yet?
Yes!
Everybody has arrived.
Everybody is here, just waiting.
Oh!
Don't start without me you little frippit.
You don't have the media training.
Okay, can you just like, please try to hurry up?
Because the last thing we wanna do is stand up a room full of singles.
Oh look, Jocelyn's pulling up to the hospital right now.
- Wait, Jocelyn's driving?
- Yes, Alexis!
She insisted!
- My nerves are fried!
-  -  -  - Stevie?
- What's up?
I think we might have to call Roland and tell him to add "do not disturb" signs to his list.
Some of the singles have been requesting them.
I think that is a service that could benefit all of us.
Hmm.
-  - Is that you?
-  - No, my phone's in my pocket.
Uh-oh.
I think that's Roland's phone.
- Oh god.
- What?
Uh, there are 17 missed calls, and 3 texts from Jocelyn.
Well, what do they say?
Roland, it's happening.
And then baby.
And then, like a whole row of baby emojis, and an explosion.
Well we-we didn't do anything wrong here.
Right?
I didn't.
You're the one who put his phone on silent.
Because you didn't know how to.
Okay, well I don't think it's helpful to be pointing fingers, here, Stevie.
Besides, I think he'll probably be back soon.
We gave him a lot of errands to run.
- David!
- Ah hey!
It's me.
- Good to see you, man.
- Yeah, good to see you, too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, okay.
Oh, good, good.
Um, so I just dropped off these, um, dog sweaters, for the pet adoption thing.
Okay, great, yeah.
It's always gifts for the dogs, and never for me.
Definitely one of my pet peeves.
Yes?
I'm sorry, I just I just was expecting Alexis, so you showing up here has really thrown me off my game.
Um no, your game is tight.
Um, Alexis actually told me to drop off the sweaters.
She was swamped with the the launch for the Singles Week thing.
- She told you, didn't she?
- Yes, she told me, yeah.
It just caught me off guard, you know?
"I love you", it just I don't Mm-hmm.
Yes.
No, that is an emotional depth that is very, very out of character for her.
So, I can understand why that would be weird for you.
- Anyway, I should be - I broke up with Heather.
So I should probably stay, then, for a minute?
Okay, so just to triple check, um, everyone has registered on the website?
All: Yes.
Yes.
Okay, just triple checking, because the website acts as a directory.
- And a message board, we know.
- Oh my god.
Sorry, when is this gonna start?
There is a seniors' craft fair that I have been asked to cover in Elmglen, but as a single woman who drove 20 miles to be here, I'd rather write about this.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, the event is starting right now.
- Good.
- Hmm.
Hey, singles, I'm Alexis Rose, and I, like all of you, am single.
I would just like to welcome you to the first annual Schitt's Creek Singles Week.
Now I know many of you are excited about the lock and key event.
The more I think about it, the more I feel like that game kind of sends the wrong message.
Because it makes it seem like, as soon as you find the right key, everything's just supposed to work out, right?
But life is more complicated than that.
Now, I used to think that my one special lock needed to be like super aggressive, and come from a long line of Adriatic royalty, or have a beard, and be really into the woods.
Then I realized that sometimes, a special little lock can come along, that you didn't think would fit because it didn't look, or act, like the lock you thought you needed.
So instead of actually giving it a real chance, you throw it away because it was too nice.
And it liked you too much, and cared.
And now that lock has found another key, and you are so happy for it, and you just need to accept that, and find a new lock.
So, are we playing a game, or not?
Yes!
That is what I'm trying to say, we're just gonna play a better game um one that kinda promotes giving people a chance.
Apparently they took Roland's phone away from him.
I don't know!
Well who would do that to a man whose wife is just about to go into labor?
I didn't take his phone!
Well, you kinda did.
Well, in our defense, Jocelyn's a few days early.
Oh, hold on, Gwen, uh, Roland just pulled in, and hammer's about to drop.
Okay, okay, guys, I know it took a little longer than I said it would but I knocked off - Roland, - everything on the list.
- Roland, Jocelyn's in labor.
- What?
Wh-when did she, why didn't she call me?
I gotta call her.
I need my phone.
I can't Where's my phone?
I can't find my phone?
- Is this it?
- Yeah, you're a lifesaver, Johnny.
Oh, well, you can thank me later, but uh, you'd better going, to the hospital.
-  - Okay.
Hi, Gwen.
No, he's-he's on his way to the hospital now.
Yeah wh snake?
Is a little harsh, but he's definitely slippery, I'll give ya that.
I'm standing right here, Bob.
Anyway, I just felt like I owed it to Heather, to be honest.
So then, um, are you gonna talk to Alexis about this?
Honestly, I don't know.
I don't know if I'm willing to put myself out there again.
I mean, David, I spent two weeks in Mexico, alone, on our honeymoon, just trying to get my life back on track.
- Yeah, that sounds very dark.
-  You know how many off-road dirt bike tours I had to take, just to get her outta my head?
Shockingly, never been on a dirt bike.
Um But I'm sure like a lot-a lot A lot of tours, David.
Okay, look, um, I would hardly call myself an expert on this subject, and by subject I mean genuine human emotion.
So, I am just going to tell you what I know.
And you can do whatever you want with that.
Okay?
I know that your name has come up in conversation every single day, for the past 6 months.
Um, I know that she's different now I mean, not that different, obviously, but um, different enough to know that she made a mistake with you.
- Or was it two mistakes?
Or more ?
- No, it was just the two.
Yeah.
Anyway, so you've been burned, a couple times.
Um, have we met?
I've been burned so many times, I'm basically the human equivalent of the inside of a roasted marshmallow.
Um, but I think it's important for us to remember that sometimes sometimes it does work out.
And um, even though everything inside us is telling us to protect ourselves, when you've got it, don't let it go.
Um  And I am telling you, that you have got it, if you want it.
Thank you, David.
Maybe this can be your thank you.
That's a dog treat?
Looks like a real treat.
What am I gonna do now?
Dr. Matheson.
Paging Dr. Matheson.
Moira, you don't have to stay, Rolie will be here any minute, and I know how much the singles event means to you.
No, no, Jocelyn, normally I wouldn't even consider leaving, but Alexis Alexis has never handled this kind of responsibility.
And I would just hate to see it all come clattering down around her.
Okay, Moira, Moira, if I may Listen, I can't speak to who Alexis was before you came here, and from what I've heard I don't really wanna dig any deeper into that, but what I can say is this.
I have watched your daughter, over the last couple of years, grow into one of the most amazing people I've ever known.
She is a hard worker, she is kind, and she is capable of so much more than people give her credit for.
Jocelyn, that is one of the most generous compliments one could receive as a mother.
We all have fears as parents, Moira, but at some point, we just have to believe in our kids.
-  -  Perhaps you're right.
Where?
Where is she?
There she is!
Okay, I found it!
Third time's a charm!
Rolie, you made it!
You may step down, ma'am, I thank you for your service.
Okay.
Bye.
Thank you for everything, Moira.
I will never forget this.
Oh, if the drugs are any good, you will.
Bye.
Dr. Matheson, call on line 2, Dr. Matheson.
There you go.
Have fun this week!
Well, David, I gotta hand it to you.
We've already sold half of our massage oils.
It's like you're an oracle when it comes to the sex lives of lonely people.
- It's a gift.
- How'd it go with Ted?
I love you.
I know I'll never be able to compete with Mariah.
Mm.
It just kind of feels like one of those perfect moments that you dream about.
Except in my dream, I'm holding a nice cup of tea.
Oh  I'm kidding.
I don't need the tea.
No, I am making this perfect moment, perfect.
-  - Hey, it's musical chairs.
It's a simple concept.
Ugh!
Keep moving!
People are clustering, and you don't want that!
Okay guys, you know what that means, 2 minutes on the clock to chat up your next new match so make it count!
- Hi.
- Oh.
So I'm guessing the press went home.
It's a shame they didn't get to see what you've pulled off!
Um, actually you may not be able to tell by the way those two are gazing into each other's eyes, they actual work for rival newspapers.
Alexis, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I underestimated you.
Thank you.
Seems there's a lot more of me in you, than I give you credit for.
- Lucky me.
- Mm hmm.
I'll take it from here.
I thought you were just apologizing for underestimating me?
You can't play the game with a clipboard in your hand.
- Go on.
Hi.
Apparently I only have two minutes, so I'm gonna make this quick.
Hi.
I'm Ted, I'm newly single.
And I'd be kidding myself if I told you that I haven't wanted to do this every single day for the last two years.
Do what?
Oh!
Oh, no, no thank you.
Oh, what a handsome guy.
He looks just like me.
And yet, he's handsome.
Hey, Moira, you haven't had a chance to hold the baby yet.
Oh, I'm I'm all right, thank you.
- I can see clearly from here.
-  Should we tell her?
Moira, what you did today meant the world to us.
And we know it wasn't exactly how you planned - on spending your day.
- Aw, it was nothing.
So, we'd like you to say hello to Roland Moira Schitt.
Wow, that's the name is really something, isn't it?
And an honor I dream not of!
Do you wanna hold him, Moira?
- Oh yeah, here you go.
- No, no please.
Comin' at ya.
- Please, no.
- Here he comes.
Roland Moira Schitt.
Oh, ha ha.
Look at that, the two Moira's.
Take him, John, my hands are shaking.
No, thank you.
