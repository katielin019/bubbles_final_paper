{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 Are you ready for this one?
Dotties' daughter Anne's getting divorced.
Hate to say "I told you so," but I told you so.
You know, we should fix her up with Bernice's son.
What's his name?
The doctor.
Oh, Vince.
And he's not a doctor.
He's a pharmacist.
Although that might appeal to Anne.
Paw-paw-paw.
Greg, you are such a crack-up.
Forget Anne who should we fix him up with, huh?
Oh, now, Stella, you know I'm still getting over the tragic loss of my wife.
She was such a strong, female woman with nice, heavy breasts.
Who's that?
Oh, that's my neighbor.
Hey, Larry.
Oh, hey Greb.
- Greg.
- Ah, that was it.
I'm not sure why I have so much trouble remembering probably 'cause our relationship is so casual.
Morning, ladies.
Hi.
Uh, do a lap without me.
I need to talk to Larry about an issue with our shared fence.
Larry, I need to talk to you about an issue with our shared fence.
Yes, I also need to discuss this shared fence issue with you.
Okay, they're out of earshot.
Why are you up so early?
No reason just excited to face a new day.
Oh, because ever since we've been down here, you've been a little depressed.
Have I?
No, no, no, don't eat the burrito.
Oh, I'm disgusting.
Okay, fine, I may have had a teensy bit of trouble adjusting when we first got here for, like, six teensy, little months, but I took your advice, and I got a job.
- Doing what?
- I sell ATVs now, eh?
Well, the truth is, these little babies sell themselves.
They're super fun, and they're a lot safer than you might think if you're standing next to one.
If you're driving it, it's actually much more dangerous than you could possibly imagine.
Well, a job is good.
I know being stuck down here in Florida isn't ideal, but we need to make the best of it.
In fact, I'm applying for a promotion at my new job.
Ah, very "noice".
And if all goes well, tonight you might be neighbors with Greg Stickney, Assistant Manager.
Very double "noice".
Well, I'm off to work.
Might want to stand back.
You're kind of in the blast zone here.
Don't want to forget the strap.
Safety first.
That's what I always ooh, okay!
Whoa!
You deserve this promotion.
Now go in there and get it.
Give 'em hell, Greg.
Good morning, Carly, Tanny.
Looks like you're keeping the machines running smoothly.
Whatever.
Carly will be the first to go.
Excuse me, sir, there's something I'd like to talk to you about.
Uh, one second.
I'm busy.
Oh, at the buzzer!
Suck it, Chase, you dirty, little hippy.
Uh, yes, well, um, as you know, I've been here for four months, and I think I'm a model employee.
Oh, no doubt.
No doubt.
You had the idea to install sinks in the bathrooms.
I love that.
Yes, what I'm getting at is, I'd like to be assistant manager.
You serious?
Oh, I just never expected you to be interested in management.
I mean, you don't seem like the type of person who's really interested in leadership roles.
Really?
Anyone who knows me would say the opposite.
I'm very hard-working.
Yeah, when you're not totally blazed.
I assure you that's not me.
Okay, tell that to the Count Blunt-ula T-shirt that you were rocking last week.
It was the only thing in lost and found.
A child and his father threw up on me.
Okay, I'll think about it.
Management!
Full of surprises, Greg.
Hello?
Go to location one now.
Marshal Haas.
Greg.
Larry.
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?
I cannot hear you.
What did you say?
We can't hear you.
I can't hear you; I think my engine's too loud.
It's your engine.
Turn off your engine.
I don't know how to turn off the engine.
We should talk in your car.
Let's all talk in my car.
Let's talk in the marshal's car.
I think we should talk in her Okay.
Let's go over the normal checklist stuff.
Have you had any contact with anyone from your previous life?
No.
Has anyone questioned your current identity either in person or online?
-  No.
- Pop quiz.
Greg, where did you go to college?
Ohio State, where I majored in communications.
Perfect.
Larry, what's your favorite movie?
- Uh, "Die Hard".
- Wrong.
Jake's favorite movie is "Die Hard".
I asked you for Larry's favorite movie.
Two people can have the same favorite movie.
They can, but they don't.
Larry's favorite movie is "Failure to Launch".
Say it.
Say, "My favorite movie is 'Failure to Launch.
'" My favorite movie is "Failure to Launch".
I wish I could believe you.
Moving on, three weeks ago an informant told the FBI where to find Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis.
Acting on that lead, 50 federal agents and I raided a warehouse in Paramus.
It was awesome.
So you got him it's over.
We can go home?
No, sorry.
Figgis wasn't there.
The raid was awesome.
Caught up with a lot of dudes I don't normally get to see.
Do you know what happened to Figgis?
No, but what we do know is that Figgis was never there.
Our Intel was wrong from minute one.
Is there any way we could help with the investigation?
No, absolutely not.
Your involvement would endanger your lives and this case.
I'm sorry, but it looks like Larry and Greg will be in Florida indefinitely.
Pop quiz, Larry: who's the female lead in "Failure to Launch"?
- Kate Hudson?
- Sarah Jessica Parker, man!
God, it's like you want to die.
So we're in Florida indefinitely.
You okay?
I squirt-anly am.
Poor choice of words, but the sentiment remains.
What?
You were right.
It's the job.
It keeps me focused.
Well, good, I'm glad to hear it.
Yep.
Now if you'll excuse me, I got to drive this Bee-otch back to work.
- What?
- Oh, sorry.
This is the Ikura Bee-otch 5,000.
Brand-new model.
Just came in.
I was gonna go for the 10,000, but that Bee-otch is way too fancy.
See you soon.
Hey, babe.
Okay, Jimmy Figgis.
Where the hell are you?
Oh, Larry.
So I marched in there and I told him I wanted that assistant manager position.
I wish my son had your backbone.
Then he could finally divorce Emily.
What does he see in her anyway?
Probably her breasts, which are heavier than average.
I don't mean to be crude, ladies, but that's just how the straight mind works.
- Oh, hey, Larry.
- Ah, hello, Groot.
- Greg.
- Right.
Is there an issue with our shared fence that we must discuss?
Nope, our shared fence is fine.
Just off to work.
Is there something going on at the ATV lot?
Yes, uh, having a sale on big, old springs.
- Shocks.
- Right.
I knew that; I was just dumbing it down for you.
At any rate, I am off.
Honk, honk.
I don't know where the horn is.
Gahh!
What the ATVs?
The only thing you're selling is a huge pile of bunk.
How did you get here so fast?
You were walking.
I was power-walking.
Roll heel, ball, toe roll heel, ball, toe.
I was already suspicious about your new positive attitude towards Florida, a state you once described as "America's stinky butt".
But then, after we met the marshal, you said something very strange.
It was "squirt-anly," wasn't it?
No, something much stranger.
You were right.
I knew then that you were up to something, so I followed you here.
I guessed the combination on the first try: 69-69.
June 9, 1969, the day my parents got married.
- No, it isn't.
- My mom's birthday.
- No.
- The moon landing.
- Nope.
- Fine, you're right.
It's a completely random number.
Look, the feds are useless.
They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.
I want to get home and see Amy.
Don't you want to see Kevin?
Of course I do.
But we were told not to get involved.
Why can't you just follow orders?
Because I hate this stupid place, and I've got to get out.
This town's claim to fame is that its mayors keep dying, and no one knows why.
That's insane.
You're selfish, and you're putting my life at risk.
So no, you're not getting those files back.
I suggest you accept the reality of the situation and make the best of it.
Snap out of it, and get a job.
Okay.
Interesting idea.
I wonder who's hiring.
Hey, everyone, just want to introduce you to our new assistant manager, Larry Sherbet.
Son of a bitch.
Larry, you want to say a few words?
Absolutely.
Thanks.
Hey, everybody.
Uh, couple things about my management style.
Number one: don't nobody ask me about what's in my cup, we ain't gonna have no problems.
Uh, two, I believe in the power of nicknames.
Smile Face, SeÃ±orita Swag, Kahuna!
Oh, yeah.
And you, my friend, we will call Mr. Fart.
Seems rather unprofessional.
He called you "Mr." Fart, Mr. Fart.
Thanks, Kahuna.
Guys, can I get real with you for one sec?
I used to work for a real stickler the type of guy that just got off on telling me what to do.
One time, he invaded my private space and stole my stuff.
Why would he do that?
Perhaps he had a good reason.
Wrong, Mr. Fart.
He was a jerk and he sucked.
But he was the one who motivated me to get off my ass and get this job, so in a way, we really have him to thank for all this happening.
-  - Give it up.
How great is this guy, Greg?
Wait, that's Greg?
- Yeah.
- The stoner?
Yeah, look at him.
He's such a Rasta.
Aw, total Rasta.
How did you even get this job?
You have zero experience.
I guess you lied on your resume.
Greg, you stoney macaroni  Of course I lied on my resume.
Our entire lives are a lie.
I straight up said I was that guy who landed the plane on the Hudson.
Taking my job just to spite me that's low, even for you.
Oh, but it's not spite.
It's blackmail.
I'm gonna be your boss, and I'm gonna make your life miserable, unless you give me back my Figgis file.
Oh, never gonna happen.
Okay.
Suit yourself.
Hope you like kids' birthdays.
Hey, everyone, someone just volunteered to be DJ B-Day.
Here at the Fun Zone, we live by one rule: when it's your birthday, you're always cool.
Parents and kids are all the same.
Watch as I do a dance to your name.
D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek.
D-d-d-d-d-d-Derek.
Again.
Figure out what's living in there yet?
Well, uh, judging by the empty beer cars, the fur, the pornography, and the claw marks, I'd say a homeless man and a raccoon.
The exact nature of their relationship is still revealing itself.
I'm gonna assume sexual.
You ready to give me those files yet?
No.
Well, then, I guess it's time for your next task.
You're gonna need to change.
Into what?
Oh, Mr. Fart.
You look perfect.
So a silly costume is that all you got?
Hardly.
Every time a go-kart drives by, I want you to scream and this is very important "Me so corny"!
You can ruin my job, Larry, but that's not all I've got here in Florida.
I've got a life.
I've got friends.
You sure about that?
Honestly, Estelle, it almost sounds like you should stop eating beef altogether.
I know.
That's what I keep saying.
Oh, go to hell, Larry!
That's my walking group!
Off to get my file?
No, you will never get the f  Greg!
Are you okay?
Yes, but we got bigger problems.
This is gonna break the Internet.
No, no, ma'am, please, you can not put that on the Inter oh!
I was hoping that would happen.
Yes!
Yes!
I don't think your wrist is supposed to move like that.
No, it's been like this since I broke it playing football in high school.
Fine, I petted a horse too hard.
If that woman posts her camera phone video that she took with a camera phone camera to the Internet, Figgis could figure out where we are.
This is your fault.
Or maybe it's your fault for stealing my files.
You know what?
It doesn't matter.
We have to get that video.
Can we please just press "pause" on this fight and work together?
Yes, on one condition: you stay the hell away from my walking group.
The walking group meant nothing to me.
That's even worse.
Okay, fine, I'll stop.
What did this lady look like?
White, female, 5'3", T-shirt that read, "Orgasm Donor".
We need more.
We need access to the security tapes.
Okay, we got teenagers stealing a stuffed gorilla, old lady siphoning gas out of a go-kart, junkie ripping copper wires out of the wall God, this place is messed up.
Ah!
There you are.
What did you find?
Not much.
Camera was behind her.
But look at her calf.
It's a tattoo of Jesus punching bin Laden in the nuts.
Hmm.
Maybe a local tattoo artist will recognize it.
It can't be that common.
That's the most common tattoo we give.
So these photos tell us nothing?
Actually, you know what?
That's a high school graduation ring.
Dan Marino High, class of 2003.
Marino High, home of the Dolphins, I suspect.
Nope, Pet Detectives.
Town was really into Marino's cameo in "Ace Ventura".
Ah, it stands to reason.
Classic film, one of my childhood favorites.
And it only gets overtly transphobic at the very end, so a win.
Anyway, thank you very much.
You've been very helpful.
But you guys getting ink, or what?
No, I already have a tattoo.
What?
Where?
Why?
How?
When?
I will never talk about it again.
Okay, now all we have to do is go to Dan Marino High and get all the personal info on the class of 2003 and then show each other our tattoos.
We're not cops anymore.
How are we gonna get access to those files?
Easy: I walk in there dressed as an exterminator saying I'm from 1-2-3 Pest Removal.
Secretary's like, "Never heard of you".
Then I'm like, "Listen, lassie, it's best you let me speak with your cipal".
I hear it.
I'm gonna drop the accent.
She takes me to see the principal you walk in behind me and download the file.
The only question is, where are we gonna find an exterminator's outfit?
We're gonna need khaki pants and a khaki shirt.
To my casual wear closet.
Hey, there, I'm the exterminator here for the Yes, you're here for the snakes.
Oh, right.
The snakes, yes.
That is why I'm here.
- This way.
- Okay.
I found our suspect.
Her name is Jordan Karfton, and she lives on Shula Lane.
How did the snake removal go?
Eeeee!
It was good.
It was good.
Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but Uh, yeah, I do.
I got you on video looking like a couple of dumbasses.
I like to think I handled it with some amount of grace.
Nope, you looked dumber than my kid Jaden, and his eyes are perma-crossed.
You want to see?
Hey, Jaden!
No, that's not necessary.
Have you posted that video to the Internet?
Not yet.
Ran out of data on my phone because of all the porn I watched.
We don't know each other.
You could've just said you were out of data.
I'm uploading the video tomorrow at my cousin's wedding.
Dog track has free Wi-Fi.
Would you ever consider not uploading it and deleting it instead?
If our boss sees that video, we could be fired.
I don't care about you.
A great viral video like that could fetch me ten grand.
And do you know what type of tanning bed I could get for that kind of money?
A mid-range one.
Not necessary.
Your tan is great as-is.
You look like an evenly-stained deck.
All right, dude.
Keep it in your pants.
Like, I get why you're into this, and I could see something going on with us later, but right now, I need the cash.
Wait, what if we gave you the $10,000?
Make it 15, you got a deal.
Fine.
Meet us tonight at the Fun Zone 8:00.
I will.
Wear something cute.
We don't have that kind of money.
Don't worry.
I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.
The only thing I need you to do is I'm not gonna show you my tattoo.
Come on, just give me a hint.
Is it an antique boat?
Is it a musket?
Is it me on a dragon?
Sir, is it me on a dragon?
Boom.
$15,000 cash.
Wow.
How'd you get it?
Oh, you didn't.
You just stuck a few 20s around a bunch of corn dog coupons.
Smart, right?
What if she decides to count it?
Oh, I'm not too worried about that.
She doesn't strike me as a big counter.
Oh, well, that's quite an assumption.
So so this is your big plan.
Oh, we need to call this off.
No, this is our best shot.
And right now, it's our only shot.
Where's my money, bitch?
Charming.
I see you brought friends.
Oh, yeah, for backup.
Well, here is your money.
It's all there if you want to count it.
Hey, I graduated high school.
I don't have to prove to you I can count.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Here's the phone.
You can delete the video.
- Thank you pictures - Hey, Billy, check it out.
I'ma stick $1,000 out of my zipper.
Hey, what the hell?
This isn't real money.
Hey, give me my phone.
You're gonna have to catch me first.
Argh!
You really thought that would work?
This video is going viral.
And you this can still happen anytime.
You know where I live.
You okay?
Yeah.
- A little sore, but - Good.
Then I can excoriate you freely.
You half-assed living in Florida, and you half-assed getting the phone back.
You've probably blown our cover, which means the marshals will have to move us.
And when they do, I'm gonna demand they send us to different cities, because I don't want you anywhere near me.
I swapped the phones.
What?
I got the video.
Sorry.
I won't bother you anymore.
Bye, Greg.
Lastly, hole 13 on the mini golf course is missing, so tell all the players to just repeat hole 12.
All right, dismissed.
Damn, Greg, you are killing it as assistant manager.
I mean, having the idea to have people come in at 9:00 a.m.that has really helped business.
Yes, that is when the sign says we're open.
Yeah.
Look, there's one other thing.
Now that you're management, I need you to promise me that you're gonna lay off the drugs.
Just a little I don't want to kill your whole stoney vibe or anything.
- I'll try.
- Thank you.
You keep this up, and I genuinely believe that you could be night manager in, like, two to three years.
Yes.
Two or three years.
Here.
In Florida.
Well, it's an all-terrain vehicle, so yeah, you can do doughnuts in your living room.
Hi, I hear you're the man to talk to about the XTR-XP 49789WJ8-09 Xtreme four-wheel drive Z-Cat.
Sir, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I think you might be more comfortable speaking with one of our other associates.
No, no, I need to talk to this particular associate and apologize for saying he half-assed his ATV sales technique.
Well, that's very nice, but I've moved on, and I'm with customers, so thanks.
These machines are death traps.
If you purchase one, you will be maimed.
You won't be maimed.
Most of the injuries are internal.
You know what?
I'm gonna speak with this gentleman for one moment.
I'm so sorry.
Give me a second.
Sir, can I speak with you over here?
What is this all about?
I've been staying away from you; I got a job.
I'm trying to make the best of it, just like you said.
Well, don't bother.
Making the best of it sucks.
I want to go home.
This town is a crap circus.
What has gotten into you?
You clearly got the promotion like you wanted.
Congratulations, by the way.
The blue looks great on you.
The day we spent acting like cops and getting that video back was the only time I've felt alive since we've been down here.
So what are you saying?
Can I take this for a test drive?
Yeah, sure.
The ignition is here.
I've ridden ATVs before antiquing in the Berkshires.
Oh, my files.
My beautiful files.
I've looked over what you've got.
Given your resources, very impressive, but I know.
It'll take me months to find Figgis, but we'll find him faster if we work together.
What if we don't find Figgis?
What if Figgis finds us?
But I thought you deleted the file.
I was going to, but this camera phone camera is not the same kind of camera phone camera as I have, so I couldn't figure out how.
But I'm glad I didn't.
I say we post this video and use it to lure Figgis down here, making ourselves into bait.
And once Figgis is here, we take him down, climb out of America's steaming orifice, and go home.
I like the way you're thinking, Greg.
It's Holt.
Captain Raymond Holt.
Now come and get us, Figgis.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 - Greg.
- Larry.
What's going on?
Any idea why Marshal Haas called this special meeting?
I don't know.
Do you think she saw the video we put on the Internet to lure Jimmy Figgis down here?
"Corn Dog pewwwnd by Go Kart".
It's "pwned," but that was really adorable.
Well, if she has, it would ruin our entire plan.
Here she comes.
- Gentlemen.
- What's up?
So how's it going?
It's good.
It's really good.
Uh, keeping a low prof.
No contact with Brooklyn.
No one's questioned our identities.
Definitely staying off the Net, right, Greg?
- Right.
- That's it?
That's all you have to say to me?
Yep, I think we're good.
So nobody's going to ask me how I'm doing?
Oh, I didn't think this was a personal conversation.
It's not; turn back around and watch the movie.
This is official business.
I was just testing you, because Greg is the kind of person who cares about his friends and can sense when something is off with them.
Is something off with you, Marshal Haas?
I don't know.
I mean, I met someone, okay, and, um I mean, it's not my husband, I mean, nothing's happened yet, but My entire body is on fire.
He's Cuban.
Is this still official business?
Of course it is.
- Shut up and watch the movie.
- Yep.
Pop quiz.
If Larry were married and everything was fine, and I mean, honestly, everything is totally fine.
Sure.
But he knew that one night with this person could give him everything he needed for the rest of his life.
- Would he do it?
- Yes?
Yes?
Good.
What if this person that Larry met was young?
I mean, really young.
Well, I don't think Larry would do anything illegal.
You know, it seems to me Larry has needs and deserves to have those needs met.
Greg, you're really great at being undercover.
You both passed the test.
Marco!
Vamanos!
Guys, guys, the marshal gave me good news about Jake.
Jake's back.
Jake's back!
Oh, we're not ready.
We need gummy worms.
We need them now!
No, Charles.
Jake is still wherever he is, but since it's been six months, the marshal is letting me write a one-page letter to Jake which she will read to him and then set on fire.
Is there anything you guys want me to write?
You have to tell Jake about my new son, Nikolaj.
That he's four years old, he's from Latvia, he calls me "comrade," and I love him so much.
Will do.
Rosa, anything you want to tell Jake?
Yeah.
Tell him I said You want me to write that you nodded slightly?
He'll know what it means.
I would like you to tell Jacob that I'm thinking about him and hoping that he's safe.
What?
Meet the new Gina, who always puts others before herself.
Can you make the whole letter about me doing that?
Yeah, I'll just tell him that everything's exactly the same.
Guys, briefing room, five minutes.
We're getting a new captain.
Again!
Hello, Larry.
It's your neighbor, Greg.
Can I try your hot tub out?
I'm thinking of getting one.
Of course, that's a totally normal thing to do in 100 degree weather.
Come on in and hop in the tub.
Thank you.
We need to talk without being overheard.
Turn on the bubbles.
You got it.
Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis saw our video.
How do you know?
A man with a thick New Jersey accent called the Fun Zone, asking to meet the guys from "the corn dog video".
Figgis is coming to kill us.
We should call the Nine-Nine for backup.
Oh, absolutely not.
That might alert the marshals.
We can take Figgis and his men down on our own.
Right.
Okay.
Let's go arm up.
Figgis has no idea what's about to hit him.
Also it probably goes without saying, but it's chill to whiz in this thing.
I mean, I have been.
You can if you want.
I haven't been if you haven't.
Have you?
I haven't.
Have you?
We can't just waltz in there and buy whatever we want.
They'll do a federal background check on Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert, and that will set off alarms in the marshal's office.
No, we'll have to bribe the gun store owner so he doesn't run our names.
But we don't have any money.
Oh, my God.
I'm the bribe, aren't I?
You're not the bribe.
Why, what's wrong with my body?
Actually I borrowed $3,000 from my walking group friend Ruth.
Ruth, I'm going to be straight with you.
I accidentally knocked up a woman.
- Greg!
- You know me.
I see a pair of thick weighty breasts and all logic flies out the window.
Heterosexual you is such a dog.
Can I help you?
Ah, no thanks, just browsing.
Although, you know what, since I'm here, why don't I grab, like, eight handguns, couple of shotguns, and, I don't know, three more handguns.
Can I see some ID?
Yes, of course, of course.
Oh.
Would you look at that?
I forgot my license, but I do happen to have this big old wad - No problem.
- Hmm?
I don't need your ID.
Federal database is down anyway.
- Wink wink.
- Ah.
So how do you like your ammo?
By the box or by the bucket?
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Our country is broken.
- What?
- Bucket!
I'll just take your biggest bucket of bullets.
Okay, everyone.
We've been assigned a new commander.
Please give him a warm welcome.
Hey, guys.
I'm Captain Stentley.
Ah, yuck, that sounds so formal.
Um Captain Jason.
No.
Call me C.J. Okay, so that's all I got, unless you guys have any questions.
Yeah, you wearing sweat pants?
No.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I am.
I, um, had some hot cocoa this morning, and I totally biffed it.
I like this guy.
Uh, if I may ask, how did you become captain?
You just seem a little, uh - Unqualified?
- No.
No, no, no, no.
It's because I am, actually.
Here's how it happened.
I had an appointment at my dermatologist at 402 7th Avenue.
But I went to 204 7th Avenue by mistake.
It's like numbers are so crazy, am I right?
- Both: Amen.
- Not really.
Anyway, there was this big drug bust going down.
I showed up, spooked the kingpin.
He darts for the front door, trips, shoots himself in the stomach accidentally, and then after that everybody pretty much surrendered very quickly and they made me a captain about a week later.
Didn't you have to pass the exams?
Like, wasn't there, like, an interview where they met you and heard you speak?
Presumably.
Look, I'm going to be honest.
Between you and me, I don't fully know what I'm doing, but it seems like you guys do, so I'm just gonna stay out of the way and give you guys whatever you need.
Ceej?
Hi, Gina Linetti here.
What I need is an assistant of my own, just to do my paperwork and all my other work.
Work is the worst.
I get it.
Uh.
Hire whoever you want.
I just want you guys to be happy.
- And I will help you with that.
- Great!
Hey, we should do a hang sesh like this every morning.
This is amazing.
Where do ya where's my office?
I love him.
He's the best captain we've ever had, hands down.
I don't know what you're so excited about.
We have dangerous task ahead of us.
Wait, I thought you said we didn't need backup.
Are you worried?
Do we need to call the Nine-Nine?
No, no, no, no.
We have the drop on Figgis, we're fully armed up, and we have plenty of time to lay a trap.
Well, okay, then.
See you around, Coral Palms.
Adios, constant pool of sweat in my taint!
You do one, Greg.
All right.
See you never, drive-through vape station.
Adios, weird Juggalo encampment!
Bye-bye, slightly askew stop sign.
Whoa-oh.
Oh, come on, for running a stop sign?
We just passed someone driving with both feet out the window.
Just be cool, Larry.
Gentlemen.
I am going to need to see your license and registration.
Yeah.
Whoa, hold on.
What do we got going on back there?
Oh, uh, yesterday's newspaper.
No, I'm talking about the pile of guns and the bucket of bullets.
- Right, right, right.
- Right, right, yeah.
Bucket of bullets, sure, sure.
I need you both to step out of the vehicle.
Yep, it'd be weird if you didn't.
This is a little bit weird.
Never been arrested before.
I mean, I was "detained" once by Taylor Swift's security team, but that was a misunderstanding.
She's probably going to write a song about me.
We got to get out of here.
Figgis could show up at any minute.
Don't worry.
We can outsmart some small-town sheriff.
We're NYPD detectives.
We caught the Son of Sam.
Ice-T plays us on TV.
We keep the Tony's safe.
Hey, fellas.
Listen, I am sorry about the delay.
We are overwhelmed here today.
We hired our first woman, so of course she needs her own bathroom and the shirt don't fit right both things chaos.
It's not a problem, Sheriff.
You have nothing to worry about.
I think we all agree that C.J. is, to put it mildly, not very impressive.
I watched him try to close the blinds in his office for 40 minutes.
He finally just gave up and changed his pants with the windows wide open.
Something has to be done, and I have a plan.
We use mankind's greatest weapon.
- A grenade.
- The written word.
Ugh, I'm out.
I drafted a letter to One Police Plaza saying that we think Captain Stentley is not a good fit for our precinct.
If we all sign it, they'll have to act.
Hey, guys, I'm Emily, Gina's assistant.
Wait, she actually got that?
"Wait, she actually got that"?
Sorry, I'm under strict orders from Gina to mock you whenever I see an opening.
Follow me, please.
Your 2:00 is here.
Okay, thanks, Em, and while I'm in this meeting, will you just shred some documents for me?
Anything you see.
It's all garbage.
On it.
What's going on?
We were busy.
Busy trying to ruin everything around here with your dumb letter?
This is a gravy train, people.
Okay, C.J. will say yes to anything we ask for.
Rosa, dare to dream.
What do you want?
For him to be gone.
You want that more than you want walls around your desk so Hitchcock can't stare at you with his big old google eyes anymore?
C.J. stays.
I love that guy.
- Yes!
- What?
- That's not fair!
- Come on.
And how about you, Charles?
What do you want, baby boy?
Well, I agree with Amy that C.J. is totally unqualified and a disaster for the precinct, and I would really love a treadmill desk so I can hit my cardio targets.
- Done.
- Yes!
- Boyle.
- I'm sorry.
I'm doing it for Nikolaj.
You'll understand once you bear unto Jake a child.
Looks like you're all alone.
Em, can you go ahead and show her out?
Right this way, please, and can I validate your parking?
I work here.
So, listen, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
It shouldn't take much time.
Great, because we actually have someplace important to be, so if it would speed things up, we're happy to waive our right to counsel.
Wow, counsel, the "C" word.
Wait, wait, wait.
You guys in law enforcement?
No, no, no.
I just have a buddy who's a detective in the NYPD.
Whoo, I bet he's better than me at getting people to talk.
Everything I know about interrogation I learned from "The Newlywed Game".
Huh.
So, look, why don't you each write down your answer to these questions.
Okay, question one, what were you going to use the guns for?
Okay, and then read 'em out when you're done.
Both: Hunting.
Okay, see, I knew you boys were on the level.
Okay, question two: What do you hunt?
- Deer.
- Grouse and other small fowl.
- Oh.
- Yep, we hunt everything.
You know, deer, grouse, a horse once.
Yes, we love killing any animal.
I hear ya.
Okay, question three: You said you had somewhere important to go, so where exactly is that?
- Dinner date.
- Dinner date.
That's what mine says as well.
Sorry about the handwriting.
The point is, neither of us are lying.
Should we just pick up our keys on the way out, or how do you want to do this?
No one has ever beaten "The Newlywed Game".
No one.
Hey, Diaz.
Right.
The walls.
Can I help you?
I need the crime stats from last month.
Fine.
One sec.
Some people, huh?
Hey, I'm up to 20,000 steps.
Seriously, Boyle?
Oh, you don't care about my health?
You don't care about if Nikolaj grows up without a papa?
You want me to die?
Honestly?
A little.
Hurts.
I can't believe they all let C.J. and Gina just buy them off.
But we don't need them, 'cause we've got you, and you're a sergeant.
Did you sign the letter yet?
Um I What did he give you?
He gave me the ability to continue to serve this community unencumbered by a necessary oversight.
Now, I really have to What did he give you?
He gave me a yogurt fridge, all right?
I asked for a yogurt fridge, and I got one, right next to my desk!
I'm only a man.
I'm sending this letter with or without your signature.
Enjoy your blood yogurt.
I will.
Time is running out.
We have the right to a phone call.
We need to call the Nine-Nine so they can sort this out with the sheriff.
No, they would want to get involved and that could endanger them.
They'd be okay with that.
Charles and Amy both love me.
Rosa's not scared of anything.
I'm like a mentor to Terry.
No, regardless, we don't have time for that.
We just have to tell the truth.
Sheriff, I'm ready to talk.
This better be good.
I'm a busy man.
You just spent 30 minutes trying to win a radio contest.
For my wife.
They're giving away Swampsgiving tickets.
I'm not really Greg, and that's not Larry.
We're Captain Raymond Holt and Detective Jake Peralta of the NYPD.
We've been targeted by Jimmy "The Butcher" Figgis, the mafia boss.
We're in witness protection, and that is the full truth.
Good one.
That's a good one.
Just call the U.S. marshal who handles our case.
She'll explain everything.
She?
Oh, come on.
This is getting crazier by the second.
But I'll tell you, I kind of want to see how it plays out.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Okay, will do.
Well, it's a guy, and he says he's never heard of either one of you.
- That's impossible.
- Listen for yourself.
- Hello.
- It's Figgis.
I have your marshal, and I'm coming for you.
See you soon, Jake.
Wait.
Great news.
I found Figgis.
This is bad.
Figgis has the marshal, and now he knows where we are.
We're sitting ducks.
That's the worst kind of duck.
Tell that to the Dutch Hookbill.
Look, the clock is ticking.
We only have one option.
Jailbreak.
And how do you propose to pull that off?
By using this rag-tag team of inmates.
Our very Suicide Squad.
All right, let's rally the troops.
Hey, fellow prisoners.
Hi, there.
Everyone, look, we haven't connected as much as maybe we should have.
That's our fault.
Why don't I just kick things off.
I'm Jake, and I like baseball.
Now you say something about yourself.
I'm Raymond.
I don't care for baseball.
Great, so now that we're all vibing at 100, quick question: If there were to a be a jailbreak "of sorts," how many of you guys would be interested in that?
Obviously if you have any moral objection okay, your hands are already all up, so I say we hop on this pony.
Great.
Now, do any of you have any special skills?
Maybe the ability to pick a lock?
Uh, I'm Mitch.
- I have a glass eye.
- Glass eye?
We'll definitely find some use for that.
- How about you, sir?
- I'm Evan.
I've been arrested for a lot of different stuff: public urination, urinating on private property, urinating 25 feet from a school, urinating out of a moving truck.
I don't think Evan gets what we're doing here.
Oh, doesn't he?
He's been here for weeks.
He knows the guard's comings and goings.
Thank you for sharing, Evan.
You are valued here.
Your turn, old-timer.
It's always guys like this that unlock the entire operation.
What do you bring to the table?
I'm Tito.
I'm great at smoking meth.
- And?
- Snorting meth.
And?
I haven't spoken to my daughter in a couple of years.
Oh, that's so sad.
Okay, so find something for Tito to do.
So I heard from One Police Plaza.
They received my letter, and apparently they also received hundreds of others in support of C.J. Yeah, Emily and I sent those in, so Emily, what was that burn I had you write down for Amy because I didn't want to forget it?
"Why so sad?
"Did you just find out American Girl doesn't make clothes in adult sizes"?
No.
"Steven Seagal called and he wants his ponytail back"?
Huh-uh.
"Gina: Hey, Amy, "what did one graphing calculator "say to the other one?
"Amy: What?
Gina: What does the sad lady own two of us"?
That's it?
- Hey, Amy - You know what?
Congratulations.
You just made sure that a terrible captain will be sticking around here indefinitely.
Come on, Santiago.
We're just trying to make the best of it.
- Yogurt?
- Never!
Yes!
40,000 steps!
- Boyle!
- I can't talk.
I got to keep my heart rate up.
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
Need a roof on this thing.
Gina, I need a roof.
- Emily.
- On it.
Listen, you selfish jerks, that guy in there, the one playing the bongos right now, he thinks we're killing it, so he's just staying out of our way.
Well, the only reason we're killing it is because Captain Holt never let us be satisfied with ourselves.
He always inspired us to work harder and smarter, to be better.
And if he were here right now, he'd be ashamed of us.
Amy, wait!
Oh!
Ah!
Ooh, ah!
You swear this guy's about to meet up with his mistress?
Yep.
Tuesday at 5:00.
It's Tanya time.
Well, there he goes.
Okay, now we got to get rid of the other deputy.
Glass eye, you're up.
Oh, so much drier than I would have thought.
Did I want it to be wet?
- Jake!
- Right!
Sorry.
Just holding an eyeball in my hand.
No big deal.
Here we go.
Yah.
What the hell?
Must have gotten too hot.
Sheriff, I'm going to go get a mop.
Okay.
And great.
Now we stage a fight; when the sheriff comes in to break it up, we take him down.
All: Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Ah!
We got us a jail fight.
Yah!
Why isn't he coming in?
I don't know, maybe he's not buying it.
Hit me harder.
Oh!
Damn, you knocked him.
What would it take for him to intervene?
Do I actually have to kill you?
No, he'd probably love that.
Ugh!
But you know what he would hate?
Okay, just go with me on this, all right?
Ugh.
I can't stay mad at you.
Ooh!
No!
No!
- Is it working?
- I think so.
Not in my jail.
No, no.
Break it up!
Whoa!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
It's 2016, man.
This is on you.
Hey, wait a minute.
You didn't give me anything to do.
You have the most important job of all.
Tell everyone what you saw here today.
Oh, God bless you.
You're giving an old meth head a reason to live forever and We don't have time for this, Tito!
Hey, Santiago, come with me a sec.
Why?
So you can show off some new cool thing that C.J. got you?
Let me guess, golden suspenders?
Can you imagine?
I would look amazing.
But that's not what I came here for.
Just follow me to the captain's office.
Hey, guys.
If Pac-Man were a stapler, he'd look like a little something like this.
Okay, so we wanted to talk to you, Captain Stentley Uh-oh.
Captain Stentley.
- Am I in trouble?
- No.
You're our boss.
Oh, right.
Are you in trouble?
No, sir.
It's just that the squad feels we've been taking advantage of you, and it has to stop.
So I returned my yogurt fridge.
I gave my treadmill desk back.
I took down my desk walls.
And I have agreed to fire my assistant's assistant Dana.
Dana?
Who's Dana?
Emily had a lot on her plate.
I don't understand.
I mean, I'm just trying to make you guys happy.
Well, if you want to do that, start acting like a real captain.
Make tough choices.
Tell people no sometimes.
Okay, if you think I need to stop doing whatever you guys want, then I will.
Yeah, that's progress.
If that's what you guys want.
- I gotta go.
- Good talk.
My door's always open, except when it's closed.
But you can open it when it's closed.
I can't believe we're fugitives on the lam, falsely accused of a crime.
There's nothing false about it.
We committed several felonies and escaped from jail.
Yeah, but we were just doing what we had to do.
We're the good guys.
This is what they all think.
Figgis is in town, and we have no car, no money, no guns; we can't go back to our houses because the police are looking for us.
It's time to call the Nine-Nine.
Absolutely not.
What is going on with you?
Nothing, I just think that we can do it alone.
Sir, we just shared one of the longest kisses of my life.
I think we can be honest with each other.
All right.
The Nine-Nine bailed me out once before when I was taken hostage by Bob, a man I had put my trust in, like a fool.
I don't want them to rescue me again.
It's embarrassing.
I need to clean up my own mess.
Captain, it's the Nine-Nine.
There's nothing wrong with asking for help from people that care about you.
This is Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Captain Holt!
Sir.
Captain Stentley.
There's an urgent situation, and we need 72 hours off to go to Florida.
Now, I can't why Absolutely not.
What?
The Eight-Six said they would cover for us, and this very important!
That's enough.
Someone once told me that being a captain means telling people no.
Oh, wait.
That was you guys.
You guys told me that.
Anyway, you're right.
You can't go.
Sorry, guys.
I kinda feel like this is my fault.
I kinda feel like this is my fault.
Not now, Emily.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 You're watching Channel 36's "Power News Live at Five".
We've got the most high school sports, the most lottery numbers, and the most weather in the Tri-Swamp area.
It's news time!
Good evening, I'm Brynn DeRose.
And I'm Slade Austin.
Tonight on "Power News," we reveal who Donald Trump is running against for President.
Plus, we'll show you the winning lottery numbers.
Could 67 be one of them?
Two prisoners have escaped from the Coral Palms sheriff's station in a daring daylight jailbreak.
The men, identified as Gregory Stickney and Larry Sherbert were arrested after a routine traffic stop revealed a cache of automatic weapons.
Less than 12 hours later, the men escaped by creating a disturbance in their cell.
Well, they started kissing, which I'm fine with really, I am, kiss whoever you want except they were both men.
Tito Amendola was also in holding at the time and witnessed the jailbreak.
I do a lot of meth.
The sheriff's office is coordinating their search with local and state police.
If you're watching, Greg and Larry, and I know you are, my men and I will not rest until we find you.
That's right, we're coming for you.
Strong words, and moving on, what if you were going through a drive-thru, and a puppy dog took your order?
The cops are looking for us, and a madman wants us dead.
We should be laying low until the Nine-Nine gets here.
Yeah, but we don't know when that's gonna be, and we need food and supplies.
Okay, I'll get some water.
Holt, are you trying to draw attention to us?
Nobody drinks water here.
Choose something blue or green.
Okay, I guess I'll go in for, uh, the Blazing Blue Rad-berry Cooler Xtreme: Code Rad.
Good choice.
I should probably get some body spray as well.
What sounds better, Liquid Moan or Turnpike?
We only have $17 to our name.
We can't spend five of it on this.
I know, but I'm about to see Amy for the first time in forever, and I want to smell like a "hot New Jersey breeze," ugh.
Good call.
All right, let's get out of here.
And in Coral Palms, law enforcement still is searching for a pair of fugitives who broke out of jail earlier this evening.
Greg Stickney and Larry Sherbert are believed to be unarmed but dangerous.
Liquid Moan, nice.
I wore this to Swampsgiving last year cleaned up.
Right on, bro.
Oh, we have a promotion on the Code Rad.
- It comes with a free cigarette.
- Oh, no.
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.
Well, if you don't want it, I'll take it.
No, no, no.
Don't do that smoking is bad.
You should quit smoking right now.
Hey Ahh.
We seem to be in the clear.
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.
I got caught on top of the fence.
Check out my calf it's like Scratch City.
How about you?
I'm fine, except I was impaled on a metal pipe.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
It's gonna be fine.
Oh, my God!
I got rifles, vests, flash grenades Chips, dips, ice cream sammies I'm pretty sure there's gonna be snacks in Florida, Scully.
Pretty sure?
Do you arrest someone if you're pretty sure they're guilty?
No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!
Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission.
Really?
Then what is this?
Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake.
All right, bad news.
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
Left, right, left, right, both, both, both.
That's so cool!
I still can't let you go to Florida, though.
Terry feels like a whore.
He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences.
I think he meant dire.
Guy's real dumb.
Who's with me?
Great, Hitchcock's in.
Who else?
I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
Shut up, Hitchcock.
Obviously, we're all going.
What's up, squadron?
I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies.
Yeah, about that.
Um, there were no tickets left.
But I brought my minivan, so Road trip!
I went to a 24-hour vet and got surgical supplies.
I was in and out like a ninja.
Needles, needles, need whoa!
So many dogs!
I'll need your assistance.
You'll have to pull out the pipe and stitch up the wound.
All right.
This is gonna hurt.
But I'm gonna get you through it.
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw up into your cut.
Ahhh, I saw inside of you.
How are humans alive?
Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery, and, uh, you just breathe, okay?
We'll get you through this.
Okay.
Ugh, what was that sound?
I did not like that squish sound.
The pipe has been removed.
Now I'm sewing myself up.
Okay, this is almost over.
You're doing great.
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.
Talking about what?
Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?
You must be excited to see her.
Very much, you know.
Oh, God, what if it doesn't go well?
We haven't seen each other in a while, and what if it's weird?
- Uhhh!
- Keep going, keep going.
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean, maybe we've grown apart.
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
- You did great, buddy.
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia.
Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth.
Oof, poor Jake.
Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks.
So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?
Aren't they a little young for that?
They're four.
Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me I'm a "safety at all costs" kind of dad.
Mm-hmm.
Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom.
We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
I didn't have to then.
So does this van have side-impact airbags?
Not in the back.
Oh.
Interesting.
No judgment here.
Sarge, I have to pee now too.
Seriously?
You, Diaz?
Look, I'll turn off at the next exit, okay?
I have to pee really badly.
Hot.
- What?
- Hitchcock!
- Guys, enough!
- Sarge Yeah, I know!
You got to pee, I got it!
- No, brake lights!
- Oh, crap.
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!
Did you get breakfast?
I tried, but I got recognized.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Do you watch a lot of pornography?
'Cause I'm in most of it.
Oh, boy.
What if you were followed?
I don't think it's safe to stay here.
Where are we gonna go?
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!
Do we have any weapons?
I have the pipe we pulled out of me.
I would sooner surrender than go anywhere near your gooey body pipe.
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.
- Oh!
- Jake?
Amy It's so good to see you.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
I can't wait to catch up with all of you when this is done.
My dad died, and Again, when this is done, Hitchcock.
Gina, you look like a fresh wizard, and I love it.
So we know that Figgis is in Coral Palms, but we don't know where he is, and we don't know how many guys he's got with him.
The plan is to lure them into the Fun Zone and ambush them.
- Any questions?
- Yes, did you miss us?
Did you ever look up at the moon and wonder if I was looking at it too?
- Yes.
- Knew it.
All right, once we get to the Fun Zone, I'll fill everyone in on the mission details.
You guys come with me.
Captain, you stay here and rest.
What?
I don't need to rest.
I'm in peak condition.
All right, then stand up.
Easy.
I love standing up.
Yeah, you're staying here.
Aw, Captain, don't worry, okay?
My sleeping pills are doing their job, and I can stay here and take care of you, okay?
Terry, I'm gonna need your gun.
That's not happening.
All right, I'll use my own.
Oops-a-daisy.
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
Vending machine at a rest stop.
Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
Now come on, guys, let's get ready.
Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi.
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my God, everyone, Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes!
Now get to it, you lovebirds.
Here we go.
Come on, man.
How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around.
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
No, those are actually always there something about lead being in the air and water and ground.
Anyways, you all have your assignments.
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
NineNine!
Chills, you guys.
Literally, chills.
Hey there, Nikolaj.
It's your papa.
If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me.
But I want you to know that I love you very much.
You want to stop filming yourself and help me with these many items I'm carrying?
Sorry, I was making a video for my son.
You know, in case I never see him again.
Do you not do that for your kids?
Of course I do.
I make those kind of videos all the time.
You know, in fact, I was about to do one right now.
Hey hey, girls.
It's me, Daddy.
If you're seeing this, I'm dead.
But I want you to know that I love you now and forever.
Okay, time for a lullaby, sung in your native Latvian.
Ligo!
Ligo!
Ligo!
Yeah, yeah, lullaby time.
Look.
Go to sleep, Daddy's dead But his ghost's always watching What the hell are you guys doing?
Good call.
Blocking the door.
Keep it up, smorty-pants.
- Oh - Uh Mwah.
One of our classic forehead smooches, just like I planned.
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?
- What?
- Huh?
Yeah.
I mean, no.
No, things aren't weird, or no to the sex?
- Maybe we should just - You're right.
Just concentrate on Figgis, and we'll figure this out later.
No, I was gonna say maybe we should talk, but yeah, it can wait till after Figgis.
Ah.
We have the rest of our lives to talk.
Yeah, unless he kills us first.
What a weird joke.
Regret saying that one.
Wow, things are clickin'.
I'm gonna go make sure there's enough balls in in the ball pit.
Yup.
Important to get on them balls.
What is wrong with me?
So then Trevor sends me a text, and he's like, "At this point, I hate you".
I'm like, "Oh, really?
'Cause you didn't hate me last week".
Trevor sounds like a dog.
Right?
God, I missed our daily dishes.
Me too.
I'm sorry I'm not reciprocating with "hot goss" of my own.
I'm just worried about the Nine-Nine.
Sir, they're gonna be fine.
They're my squad.
I should be there with them.
This is killing me.
Well, I'm not gonna let it.
Let's go.
But my wound, Gina.
Sir, with your brain and my body and my brain we make one unstoppable unit.
Now climb aboard, sir.
And let's go.
Oof.
All right, everybody ready?
Good.
Let's set this trap.
Hello.
- Hello, Figgis.
- Peralta.
Congratulations on escaping prison.
Thank you.
Congrats on sucking.
You know, I'm bored.
I'd love to kill you tonight.
So where you hiding?
Wouldn't you like you know?
Round one.
You're never gonna find me.
I'm invisible.
Mommy, I won!
I won a big pwize!
Downtown!
I'm everywhere, and I'm nowhere.
And I'm coming for you.
Peace out, loser.
He's at the Fun Zone.
Gear up.
This ends tonight.
Uh!
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry, babe.
What were you aiming for?
Hey, got you a bag of Blue Rad-berry slushie for the swelling.
I would've just gotten ice, but a possum died in the ice machine.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Why do we keep hurting each other?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overthinking it.
It just feels like we're not - On the same page.
- Clicking.
That was basically the same thing.
- I count that.
- Yeah.
Look, I know this isn't the right time for some big talk, but I just want us to be normal again.
Yeah, me too.
I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.
- What?
- Why did I say that?
Why did you kiss Holt?
I didn't.
I did.
We did it to get out of jail, but it didn't mean anything.
Just forget I said anything, right?
Rewind.
- And kiss.
- Jake You want to know if there was tongue.
I can tell you, decidedly there was not.
No, Jake.
Figgis is here.
Okay, well, good talk.
Don't die.
Holt had very soft lips.
Wish I hadn't said that one either.
- We should get into positions.
- Yeah, okay.
Hey, kill the lights!
Figgis is here!
Excuse me, ma'am, this dolly's being used.
Broccoli Che visto?
It's being used.
Quanti erala Vito la Bella?
Tutto matro lamente?
Just bring it back when you're done.
Ah!
Garbanzo marinara!
PizzerÃ­a restaurante!
Ahh!
Jackpot.
Let's do this.
And how am I supposed to get all the way up there?
Gracefully.
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!
Boost my bottom!
I'm boosting!
Boost it!
Ah.
All right stick shift.
I can't drive stick shift.
You're gonna have to drive.
How?
My leg doesn't work.
Sir, I am a dancer.
I will be your legs.
Clutch in.
- Okay.
- Clutch out.
- Oh!
- Hoo-hoo!
We are the best driver in the world!
Spread out and find 'em.
Bogie headed to the ball pit.
Is that all you got?
I'll take your best shot I'll take your best shot, I'll take your best shot!
Boom - Here comes the.
Boom - Ready or not.
Here comes the boys from the South - Is that all you got?
- I'll take your best shot.
- Well, it's all right - I'll take your best shot - I'll take your best shot - Boom.
Here comes the - Boom.
Ready or not, ha ha, how you like me now?
Peralta Holt.
I know you're here.
I'm gonna kill you.
- I don't think so.
- Oh Put down the weapon, Figgis.
There you go.
Oh, yes.
I've been waiting for this moment a long time.
You ruined my life.
I had to live in Florida for six months!
It's the worst.
Have you tried the pizza down here?
Yeah, it's the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.
It somehow burned my mouth and is cold at the same time.
But none of that changes the fact that you're about to go to prison for the rest of your life.
Drop it, Sherbert!
What?
No!
I've been everywhere, and I finally spotted your minivan with the New York plates parked around back.
We already got all your friends.
So drop it.
You don't understand.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.
This is Jimmy Figgis; he's wanted by the FBI.
No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio, and I came here to repair a skee ball machine on the the fritz, but suddenly he's trying to kill me.
He's lying.
"Constantine Binvoglio".
It's clearly a name he just made up.
I'm very impressed.
That was pretty good.
I will shoot you, Sherbert.
All right, fine, I will put down my weapon, but you have to promise me you will not let this man go.
Okay, well, we're gonna cuff everyone, and then we're gonna sort this all out.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.
No!
Now let's me and you take a little walk.
Ooh.
How do you think you're getting out of this, Figgis?
Do you even have a plan?
I'm gonna hold you hostage to get away.
Then I'm gonna drive to a gas station where I'll steal a clean car and head for the airport, where I'll buy a ticket with my false ID, then kill you in the parking lot and disappear again.
Pfft.
You're scrambling.
Look, I told you, we're NYPD.
- Yeah, right.
- I can prove it.
Look up "Brooklyn detective attacked by birds".
You'll see an article with a photo of me.
Officer down.
All available units respond.
I'm gonna give you a window, and you're gonna go after Jake.
My name is Detective Rosa Diaz, NYPD.
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.
Keep walking.
Let him go.
Put that gun down, or he dies.
He's not gonna shoot me.
He needs me alive to get out of here.
Yeah, you willing to take that bet?
I wouldn't.
Now put the gun down.
Oh!
You shot him!
Are you okay?
I'm sorry I shot you.
I thought that's what the nod meant.
It was.
It was awesome.
It was actually just like the end of "Speed," which is a pretty good movie.
It's not as good as "Die Hard".
"Die Hard"'s perfect.
Okay, Jake, I'm gonna go after Figgis.
Yeah, I was gonna say, you should keep going after Figgis.
Same page, still.
Get out of the car!
Young Jeezy take the wheel!
Freeze, punk!
Yeah, freeze, punk!
Gina, where did you get that gun?
Lost and found at the storage facility.
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.
Hey, Figgis.
My fiancÃ©, Adrian Pimento, said when I caught you, I should read you this letter.
"I want to lick the skin off your body, baby".
Oh, that side's for me.
"I want to rip the skin off your body, Jimmy".
We're sorry we doubted you, sir.
You really saved our butts.
I can't take credit for that.
Gina Linetti is the real hero here.
But isn't Gina Linetti more of a state of mind?
Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today.
Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital.
Hey, how's the sheriff?
Well, he keeps yelling, "Disability for life"!
So I think he's fine.
Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah.
How are you doing?
Fine you know, just getting bandaged up.
Actually, can you give us a second?
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now.
Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?
Yeah.
B positive.
Well, guessed wrong.
Hey, Craig?
Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back.
How was Florida?
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.
Come on, man.
Now, before you say anything, I know we disobeyed a direct order.
Sergeant, relax, okay?
Your friends were in trouble; you did what you had to do.
And now I got to do what I got to do.
Oh, no, a memorandum of admonishment?
Much worse you're never gonna see the sun again.
Your families they're gonna forget your faces.
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime and dinner at breakfast.
And you'll Ah, what was I talking about?
I totally lost my train.
- You were punishing us.
- Yes, thank you.
Ah!
I'm transferring the whole squad to the night shift.
Noooo!
Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1  Hey, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.
So what's this secret meeting all about?
You guys know I'm not medically cleared for another week.
It's not a secret meeting, Jake.
It's an intervention.
The tips have to go.
What?
Why?
Jake, we're worried about you, and you look very stupid.
C'mon, guys.
I think they're kind of cool, retro.
No, they're terrible.
Amy, come on.
You're digging the tips, right?
No, I feel like I'm kissing Vanilla Ice.
There was a time you would've jumped at that chance.
They have to go.
All right, you guys got me.
I did it as a joke.
I kept them ironically.
Pretty funny, right?
I'm just gonna head out.
- Get him!
- No!
Yes, Terry!
Okay, okay.
Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I'll admit it.
I went too deep down there in Florida.
At one point, I think I forgot where the tip of me ended, and the base of the tips began.
Before we just chop 'em off, 'would anybody like to say some final words?
- No.
- That was one word.
That counts.
Thank you, Rosa.
Okay, I'm ready.
Sorry I'm late everyone, but trust me, it's worth it.
Me and Jake are tip buds.
What?
No!
Both: No!
You know what I do see it.
It's bad.
It looks bad.
Brace yourselves 'cause Jake-y is back.
Don't everybody mob me at once.
We can high-five one at a time.
Oh, I see no response.
A little "welcome back to the precinct" hazing.
Who's behind this cute little prank?
Diaz?
Kill yourself.
Okay.
I told you.
Night shift has everyone a little down.
Yeah, just because you don't get to sleep or see your loved ones or feel the sun or do anything that brings you joy.
That's all.
I personally like the night shift.
You know who else is up right now?
Murderers?
Armed robbers?
Australians.
It's an whole new demographic for me to conquer.
I already have the third most followers behind Iggy Azalea and the Perth Zoo Wallaby cam.
Wow, that's pretty good.
It's not just good, Jake.
It's bonzer.
Night shift is boring.
Listen to the cases I've had: Drunk and disorderly, drunk and disorderly, cyber crime Ooh, cyber crime.
Pretty cool.
Caught a drunk guy humping a laptop.
Well, we've all been there.
But my point is this: I don't care what time it is.
I'm always happy to be here.
Nine-Nine!
Nine-Niiine!
A-Noine-Noine!
I'm gonna keep doing it until you guys chime in.
A-Noine-Noine!
Sergeant Jeffords, a word.
What is wrong with everyone?
I'm worried our night shift morale problem has gotten worse.
Yeah, you think?
I'm sorry.
I'm exhausted.
My wife says when I get tired, I get night sassy.
Night sassy?
Hearing problems, much?
Sorry.
Should I just go tell everyone to buck up and do their jobs?
No, the squad's only on night shift because they came down to Florida to save Jake and me.
It's my responsibility to fix this, so I'm going to brighten the mood by telling a few jokes.
Try this one on for size: I don't care for cheese.
I'm a curd-mudgeon.
Wow.
You're too tired for humor.
If he isn't taking his medicine, you could mix it in with his food.
Sorry, you can deal with your sick dog later, Boyle.
Well, actually, that was about my son, Nikolaj.
He's got allergies.
I think we may have to go with a nasal douche.
Ah, nasal douche.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Very gross.
Anyways, I'm back to being a cop.
It's all I've thought about for the last six months.
Hurtful.
But I won't be fully back until I've solved a case, just like old times.
And I can't do that without my partner.
Pfft, you're not solving any cases on the night shift.
Lohank?
Oh, my God, you look Beautiful?
I was gonna say "less sad".
Ever since I moved to the day shift, I'm happier, healthier, my stepson gave me my debit card back.
Lohank is happy and confident?
Everything's off.
Oh, no.
We're in the Upside Down.
That's right.
I'm gonna tell you the same thing they told me when they removed my testicle: Welcome to your new life.
Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let the night shift win.
Me and my main man Boyle are about to solve a case.
Isn't that right, Charles?
Oh, you know we will.
We'll call ourselves the Night Boys.
Kind of sounds like a male escort service.
- The Midnight Men.
- Even worse.
The Dark Stallions.
Looks like we're going with the Night Boys.
Whoo!
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but the night shift is taking all the fun out of paperwork.
- Mm-hmm.
- At least we're getting to - spend quality time together.
- Totally I'll be back in 40 minutes.
What?
Where are you going?
We have to finish this by morning.
Yeah, I know.
I just have something important I have to do.
What?
I have to get Some pens.
Then why are you putting your jacket on?
- Pen store's a block away.
- The nearest pen store is seven blocks away, and it doesn't open until 9:00 a.m. I learned that the hard way.
You really think you can lie to me?
- No.
- A-ha!
You're lying to me right now.
You do think you can lie to me.
- Yep.
- Wait.
Hang on.
- Was that a lie?
- I don't know, maybe.
- All right, see ya.
-  Ah, our first case.
Tasty little B&E just what the doctor ordered.
Not actually, she recommended another week of bed rest.
I was like, "Whatever, dorkus".
Ah, check it out: Ducking under police tape.
I missed this.
Charles Yep, yep, on it, on it, Jake-y.
- I got it.
- Got it.
What do we got?
Back window's broken, two sets of sneaker prints, alarm went off at 11:43, and security arrived at 11:46.
Perps were already gone.
Okay, I'm thinking classic us.
I'm thinking old times.
I'm thinking  Rigity-rigity-role playas!
Yes, okay, I'm Jacques Guillaume, and you are Henri Renault.
We are cat burglars on vacation from France.
I love it although Henri went to an elite international school, so he does not speak with an accent.
Wow, nice, way to flesh out the characters.
Thank you, okay, so I break the back window, make my way over to the jewelry case.
Meanwhile, you're standing lookout by the front door Oui, oui.
Smoking a cigarette.
Check it: Ash.
Ooh la la.
Okay, so I am smoking.
What are you doing?
Oh, Jacques rolls his own cigarettes, a habit he picked up from a prostitute in Marseille, but that is not all he picked up.
Why do all your characters get STDs?
Because they're living life!
All right, so I go to the first case smash steal a bunch of watches.
Move over to the second case smash bracelets.
But then, we hear a sound, and I yell, "Les gendarmes!
Ils sont ici"!
And I know what that means because I'm French, but I ask you to repeat it in English, just to be sure.
Police are here.
Yes, we gotta get outta here, so we turn to leave, you flick your cigarette.
Using the cane, using the cane, this is awesome.
Voila!
Zee butt.
I thought Henri didn't have an accent.
It comes out when he gets excited.
Great news, everyone.
We just got our first lead on our first case on my first night back, proving once and for all that absolutely nothing has changed.
Yeah, this opens in instead of out now.
They switched it a month ago.
Yeah, so the door changed, sure, but that's it.
Well, we have got ourselves a case and a key piece of evidence.
We should be wrapping this thing up in no time.
As long as we do it before sunup.
As soon as the shift is over, I kind of have to get home.
But we're gonna work until it's done, right?
I mean, that's how we do it.
Yeah, I just like to be home as soon as Nikolaj wakes up so I can make him breakfast.
Sure, yeah, not a problem we'll be home by sunup.
Just like a couple of sexy "Twilight" vampires.
I am Robert Pattinson.
I vant to turn into a bat.
I've never seen the movies.
No, me neither they're an insult to the books.
Okay.
Crank up the tunes, Boyle.
The Night Boys need an anthem.
Something dark, something tough, something I already got it.
You know what?
I'm into it.
The night shift won't slow us down.
Why is this going so slow?
Where is everyone?
Well, it is 3:00 a.m. It's a pretty bare-bones crew.
Hi, can I help you?
Are you lost?
Can I get you something coffee, tea?
You know what we're in a bit of a hurry.
Can you run this DNA for us?
Well, of course.
Sorry, not many people stopping by at night.
Sometimes it makes you like   Right?
Both: Uh-huh.
I'll be back in a sec.
Cool.
Yikes not exactly the A-team at this hour.
"A-Team," are you guys talking "A-Team"?
I love that show I could download it.
We should binge it.
This is gonna be fun.
Yep, totally excited to watch five full seasons of television with you, but could you actually run the DNA for us first?
It kind of feels like you're prioritizing work over our friendship.
Because I barely know you?
Fine, message received.
Oh, welcome back from your third massive break of the night.
- Thanks.
- I was being sarcastic.
- Where do you keep going?
- Not saying.
- Tell me, Diaz.
- Nope.
- Come on, tell me.
- Not talking about it.
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me Fine.
I was in the bathroom.
I'm having stomach problems.
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
- It's real bad - No, that's all right.
- You should've been there.
- I don't have to hear it.
- It was like a massacre.
- No, you can please stop.
- Multiple flush.
- Please stop.
- Attention, squad.
Everyone, gather 'round.
I've been researching ways to raise morale, and I found an interesting article in a scientific journal.
Oh, was it from "The American Journal of No One Cares"?
According to a recent study, the physical act of smiling can improve your mood.
I suggest we give it a shot.
Eh?
Now you all try.
Big smiles, bigger, bigger!
Great, now we just have to stay like this for the next two hours.
Can you feel it working?
I don't have any enamel on my teeth, so the cold air is excruciating.
Maybe if you brushed your teeth once in a while, this wouldn't be a problem.
I do brush my teeth.
They're decaying from acid reflux.
You're embarrassing yourself.
-  - Crikey.
You're not Australian, Gina.
Get stuffed, ya drongo.
Guys, seriously, too much exposure to air, and they will turn to dust.
This isn't working out as well as I'd hoped.
Time for the next level: Forced laughing.
Well, that lab tech took a long time.
Once we agreed to go to his birthday party, he was actually pretty fast.
But, most importantly, we got a DNA match.
We're looking for Dave Smith.
Sounds like a real piece of crap.
You said it.
Now we just gotta pull his files from records.
Yep, then we bust him, and we'll be done with plenty of time before Nikolaj wakes up.
Nikolaj.
Hm?
Nikolaj, yeah, I said it.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
Not even close.
Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Almost Nikolaj.
Nikolaj I feel like I'm saying it.
You know what it doesn't matter.
Hit me with the music!
All night long - All night - All night Hi there, we just need to pull a file Can't system's down.
They do maintenance at night.
That's okay, we'll just go to another precinct.
- That's all.
- Yep.
All night long - All night - All night Hi, can we get this file, please?
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Oh, absolutely, honey.
She's going extremely slow.
She's going so slow.
There we go.
Oh, my glasses.
All right, we'll just go to Five-Four.
- All night - No.
Hello, hi, please, file now, hurry.
Sorry, dude.
I don't know how to get onto this system I'm a temp.
May I?
Great, let me just get over oh, good lord, that is porn.
- Oh, is that not allowed?
- It is not.
No problem, we just close these tabs - You've got a lot of them.
- Mm.
Type 3 and type 9 and 12 and 13 those are all the diabeteses I have.
It's true what they say: Night shift makes for strange bedfellows.
In your dreams, perv.
Ugh.
Rosa?
What the hell?
She said she was in the bathroom again.
Nah, she hasn't been to the bathroom since 8:27.
What?
Also ew.
C'mon, Hitchcock.
Busted.
Man, this Dave Smith's bad news: Armed robbery, aggravated assault, attempted murder Well, he's about to get a visit from the Night Boys.
Gah, this stupid limp is slowing me down.
Charles, can you Oh, give you a piggy?
- What?
- Yeah, jump on it I'll give you a piggy.
Actually, I'm good.
I was just gonna ask if you'd hold my bag.
Oh, yeah, sure, makes more sense.
- Yeah.
- Embarrassed.
Anyways, this is great.
We're definitely gonna catch this guy before sunup, and you will be home to see your kid.
Oh, no!
Son of a bitch.
Jake, come on in.
Nikolaj, look who it is.
You remember Jake Peralta.
From the stories.
Yeah, we talk about you at bedtime.
Ah.
Look at my cement truck.
- He loves trucks.
- Cool, it's cool, buddy.
Hey, listen, I know you're with your kid, but I checked the file, and our perp's last known address is like two blocks from here.
Really?
We gotta go take him down.
Yes, there's the Charles I know.
- Tonight, Dave Smith goes down.
- Tonight?
No, Charles, we gotta go now.
You saw this guy's rap sheet he was arrested for attempted mur Tickling, tickling attempted tickling.
Right, tickling.
Look, uh, Charles, this guy's a real doodyhead, all right?
He tickled once he may tickle again.
He might be tickling as we speak.
We could be dealing with a serial tickler.
I really want to go, Jake, but I'm here alone with Nikolaj.
Genevieve doesn't get back for three hours.
So let's just take him with us.
Nah, that's crazy or is it just crazy enough to work?
Just crazy.
Ah, man, it stinks you've gotta watch him it's really messing everything up.
I mean, that came out wrong.
I love that you have a son it's not messing everything up.
Just messing up our ability to solve the case and have fun.
Ah, you know what I mean.
I'm a nice guy I'm in the right.
I'll just go myself.
Bye, Nikolaj.
Nikolaj.
Yeah, whatever.
See ya.
I know your shift is over, and you've had a challenging night, but I think I've found a new way to raise morale.
Follow me to the briefing room.
What's all this?
It's an after-work hang.
Just trying to turn up, as it were.
We got snacks, games, decorations, chairs Yes, chairs.
Cool, maybe we can mill around and small talk about how some of us are big lying liars who lie all the time like a bunch of liars, Rosa.
I don't think that's good party convo.
Uh, maybe we should just name our favorite sailing knot.
I'll start.
The bowline.
How about some tunes?
Cool, merry-go-round music.
Yeah, John Phillips Sousa, the Skrillex of his day.
C'mon, people, hit the dance floor.
Have a good time.
Why is no one having a good time?
I specifically requested it.
Gina, why aren't you dancing?
I can't.
I'm in the middle of a feud with the "that's not a knife" guy from "Crocodile Dundee".
He's being a real bitch.
Fine, I guess I'll just stop the party.
I didn't realize it ever started.
Enough.
I tried to make this fun.
I even learned what Skrillex was.
Sorry you're all miserable, but guess what.
So am I. I'm exhausted all the time, I never see my husband, the late-night NPR programming pure garbage.
I'm done trying.
We can all be miserable together.
Just go home.
Hey, I saw you earlier.
You weren't in the bathroom.
You were on a park bench playing on your phone.
Yeah, you left me to do everything while I thought you were pooping.
I wish you were pooping.
I wish to God.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Rosa, crying don't know what to do.
Pat, pat.
This feels wrong.
We put away Figgis three weeks ago.
Pimento should've been back by now.
We had plans to meet on that park bench once the coast was clear, but he hasn't shown up.
Maybe he's deep undercover, or he doesn't remember who he is, or maybe he's dead.
Wow, thanks.
You're right, my fiancÃ©'s a total weirdo who's probably dead.
I'll just give up on him and go do my paperwork.
No, Diaz, wait maybe he's just really, really injured.
Come on, Amy.
All right, Fiske, Jones, Thompkins  Smith.
Smith.
Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze!
Slow down!
This isn't fair!
I have a cane.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
NYPD.
NYPD I need to commandeer this vehicle.
It's a crossover.
It's a crossover SUV, and you can't have it.
I'm a cop can you please get out of the car?
No, this Schmidt's mom's car, and I'm more scared of her than I am of some two-bit thug.
I'm not a thug I'm police.
Okay, then name one law.
Don't kill people.
That's on me I set the bar too low.
Look, can you please just get out?
Okay, you can drive, but I'm not getting out.
- Right.
- Also, I have the seat warmer on I don't just have a really hot butt.
Doesn't matter to me a perp is getting away.
Oh, it's very hot.
I can't believe this is happening.
Thanks a lot, New York.
You know what, if your city's so great, then how come it's not the state capital?
What who cares about the state's capital?
This is the concrete jungle where dreams are made of.
That doesn't sound right where dreams are made of?
I don't know you tell me.
- It's your dumb city.
- It's grammatically odd.
Whatever, I'm sure wherever you're from has strange songs - written about it, too.
- Los Angeles?
Damn it, all the songs there are so good.
Hey, watch my soup.
I'm chasing a criminal.
Your soup is not important.
You took an oath to serve and protect.
That applies to my soup.
You know that's not what the oath is about.
You're making a point you don't even believe in.
Garbage truck!
- Oh.
- Damn it!
He got away.
Well, I spilled my soup.
You tell me which is worse.
My thing.
Very clearly my thing.
Captain Holt, can we talk to you?
What is the meaning of this?
Am I the subject of a punking?
It's a beginning-of-work hang.
And why are you all in such good moods?
Because you told us that you're miserable, too.
And that means you'll fight to get us off the night shift, right?
Well, here's what I have to say about that: The night shift stinks stinks like a butt.
And I will do everything in my power to make sure we get back to the day shift.
What are we standing around for?
Put some Sousa on already.
I want to get wild.
Well, well, well, if it isn't one of the world-famous Night Bros.
It's the Night Boys, and why did I correct you?
I would've preferred "Bros".
Did you solve your case yet?
- No.
- Night shift, am I right?
You remind me of me.
It's not the night shift, okay?
I found the perp, and I would've taken him down, but I'm hobbled, and I didn't have a partner because ever since Boyle had a son, that's all he can focus on.
Whoa, hey, are you angry at Boyle for having a kid?
No, I'm just mad because I'm working the night shift, and I have to use a cane, and, yes, the one thing I could always count on no matter what Boyle being there for me is also gone.
What do you say we let day shift Lohank take - a crack at this?
-  I'm gonna put a little something up in the old hopper.
You tell me if it vibes with you.
That's so gross.
Life moves forwards, not backwards, and things will never be as they were.
And you can be angry about that, or you can embrace the fact that your best friend now has a son.
How cool is that, amigo?
Ugh, "amigo".
All right, fine, yes, I'll admit it, it is pretty cool.
Boyle's wanted it for a very long time.
I guess I haven't actually spent that much time with Nikolaj yet.
-  - Nikolaj.
Man, am I seriously about to take emotional advice from Lohank?
You know you want to, compadre.
Go to him.
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I shouldn't have said that about Pimento.
I'm sure he's gonna come back.
I'm not even thinking about it anymore.
That wasn't even me crying in the bathroom earlier that was someone else with these same boots, but now she's gone.
Look, when Jake was in witness protection, and I didn't know when he was ever coming back, you were always there when I needed to vent.
So I'll do your paperwork, and if you ever want company on that bench, I'm there.
Thanks I would advise against it though if he does come back, things are gonna get real raunchy, real fast, like, do a lot of licking, that's probably indecent exposure - I don't want to get - Okay, got it.
You know what I'll just start with this stack right hehere.
Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk.
Hey, what's up?
I can't work the case tonight.
Nikolaj's allergies are acting up, and now the dog seems to be allergic to him.
It's this whole thing.
Did you find Smith?
No, uh, he actually got away.
- Sorry, man.
- Ah, it's all right.
It's the day shift's problem now.
Whatever happened to working until it's done?
Honestly Lohank kind of talked some sense into me.
- Lohank?
- Yeah, it was so gross, - but I want to apologize.
- For what?
Well, I kept talking about how I wanted everything to go back to normal, but if that actually happened, this little guy wouldn't be here.
Or is he big?
I don't know what size kids are supposed to be, or anything about kids, really.
I think maybe that's part of the problem it doesn't matter.
I got a present for Nikolaj.
Thanks, Jake.
Come on in, give it to him.
- Niko.
- Hey, little man.
A garbage truck!
You wanna know something cool?
A truck just like this almost killed me today.
Uh, kissed me, almost kissed me.
Anyway, let's get some trash in this thing am I right?
You're silly.
Yeah.
I am silly.
Oh, my God, this is a dream come true.
I gotta get my phone I gotta film this.
Oh, but then I'll miss it.
Oh, but I want it forever.
Agh, but I should stay in the moment.
Ah, but then I'll forget.
Oh, my God, this is a nightmare.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1  Attention, squad.
Mm, pretty dainty way to make an announcement.
It's a workplace.
I wanted to be respectful.
Well, as someone at a high risk for a spook-related death, thank you.
As I was saying, it's time for round four of the Halloween Heist   If I don't make it, tell Gina I love her.
What's up, Nine-Nine?
Jake Peralta here to tell you that tonight is the night for the Halloween Heist.
Amy already went over this.
What?
Ames, what are you doing?
I always announce the heist.
Yeah, Amy, what the hell are you doing?
Exercising my right to announce the heist as the defending champion.
Defending champion.
The only reason you won is 'cause no one knew you were even playing.
It was a pathetic act of pure cowardice.
Whoa, she's your girlfriend, Peralta.
Not tonight, she isn't.
Although don't kiss anyone else.
I love you so much.
Now, then, this one's for all  - Such a dork.
- So cool.
Attention, squad.
- Tonight - Nope.
Y'all three really should have coordinated.
What?
I really should be the one to introduce the heist, as the last legitimate champion.
Peralta hasn't won since the first year.
He's a has-been.
Yeah, well, this has-been has been with yo' mama all week.
Sorry, I feel like I crossed a line; I apologize.
-  - Attention, everyone.
Enough.
We know.
The heist is happening.
No!
My ex-wife just died.
No more alimony, baby!
This year's Halloween Heist is a three-way tiebreaker to determine the champion of champions.
We'll be playing for this: a plaque that reads, "The Ultimate Detective/Genius".
You and Santiago should quit now.
I'm going to stomp on your dreams.
It's fun to see you so passionate.
I will slit you both open from mouth to anus and wear you like jackets.
Wow.
Is it weird that that turned me on a little bit?
Doesn't matter.
But let's move on.
The plaque will be held in this.
Is that my childhood caboodle?
It most certainly is, but don't worry.
I removed the scrunchies, old report cards, and photos of young Al Gore.
I'm better-looking than him anyway.
We're talking a young Al Gore?
Peralta, you do make me laugh.
Okay, stings a little bit.
It will be secured with this brand-new lock.
Hitchcock, if you would do the honors.
There you are.
You can have that back in three Nope, don't ever need it back.
Now, then, locking the caboodle.
The "ca-boo-dale" will be placed in the center of the bullpen.
Right, and what is the name of the store at the mall that sells the sticky pastries?
You mean the "See-nay-bone"?
Yeah, that was it.
Thanks.
Continue.
Whoever possesses the plaque at sunup wins.
Now let's pick teams.
I've got a ton of work.
You can just leave me out this year.
- Interesting.
Interesting.
- Oh, Terry, Terry, Terry.
What?
How naive do you think we are?
You're "not participating" so you can sneak under our noses and steal a victory, like Santiago did last year.
I'm going to my desk.
Heists are dumb.
If you have nothing to hide, then I'm sure you won't mind me asking Hitchcock and Scully to keep an eye on you.
Whatever.
My eyes will be glued to that ass.
Great!
It's now time to choose from the remaining players.
Amy, since you're last year's champion, you go first.
- I choose Rosa.
- Dope.
I select Charles Boyle.
What?
What's the matter, Peralta?
Were you expecting to have Detective Boyle on your team?
Have I thrown a wrench into your plans?
Absolutely not.
I'm just surprised, because you have such a strong connection with Gina.
But I'm glad she's on my team.
I had absolutely nothing planned for Charles.
I totally planned everything for Charles.
- This is a nightmare!
- Ew!
What can Charles Boyle do that I can't?
Roller-skate like an angel.
Whore, I'm great on skates.
Or are you forgetting Jenn Sutton's fourth grade birthday party?
I have definitely forgotten that.
Well, I skated like a pro, and then I spent seven minutes in heaven with the Todd Cohen.
It was dope.
My point is, I can do anything Charles can.
Except look exactly like the body double I got for him.
Bill, you can come out now.
Hi.
Okay, yeah, this pasty white guy is gonna be a problem.
So I believe the key to good teamwork is an equal exchange of ideas Stop.
I know you already have a plan.
And I want to win, so for the next eight hours, I'm down with all your nerdy crap.
Come on, Amy.
Show me the binder.
Okay, but it's not a binder.
It's a virtual binder, and it's encrypted on this flash drive.
That's my girl.
Now, where's the 3-D model of the precinct?
Inside the key chain.
It's a frickin' hologram.
Yes.
I'm so excited, Captain.
So how are we gonna do it?
Here's everything you need to know.
- It's blank.
- It's a metaphor.
You get nothing.
You lose.
Good day, sir.
But we're teammates.
You chose me.
You're too close with Peralta.
I don't trust you.
I only chose you to disrupt his plans.
And now that you've served your purpose, you're no longer needed.
I feel so used.
Am I just a piece of meat to you?
Yes.
Now, put on a smile, Pork Chop.
So what are you planning for the heist?
The only thing I'm planning is getting my work done.
Sure, you are.
Come clean, or we'll tell everybody about your mistress.
I don't have a mistress.
You don't?
But you're so good-looking.
What's the point?
As expected, all eyes are on the caboodle.
It's go time.
Now, Gina.
Whoopsie!
Bill, but you got to stand like me.
I'm kind of like a young Brando, so give it that energy.
Okay, yeah.
You're doing the best you can with the tools that you have.
Looks like nobody's onto us.
Go, Gina!
So, Bill, do you have a real job or I'm the third in a lot of marriages.
I got a nice soft face, so I don't intimidate the husbands.
Hmm, strange, the random person I hired off the streets of Brooklyn is a weirdo.
- What?
- Hmm?
Nothing.
There she goes.
Now, Bill, the key here is that I came in before work and replaced the door handles with ones that lock from the outside.
Pretty smart.
All right, Bill.
The time is now.
Show your face.
Show your face to the world!
What the hell?
Amy!
Pick your jaws up off the floor, ladies.
Where did Gina come from?
And here comes Jake!
Whoo!
Welcome to the big show.
I was gonna sneak the plaque out without anybody knowing, but then I thought so much more fun to make you watch.
Now enjoy as I steal the plaque of destiny.
Ah, trying to pick the lock, El CapitÃ¡n?
That'll take at least three minutes, by which time I will have hidden this plaque somewhere you will never find it.
VoilÃ .
Of course, you could break the window, but you would never knowingly destroy government property, would you?
Whoop!
Well, misread that one.
Gina, skate!
Skate like the wind!
- Aah!
- So long, suckers!
Oh!
Gina, are you okay?
It's cool.
I'm fine.
Ain't no thang.
Totally, girl!
You look good!
Oh, it hurts so bad.
I hope to God I'm not humbled by this.
I'm so sorry, Gina.
It should have been Charles on those skates.
This is why you should always roller-skate with a helmet and a mouth guard.
Hey, don't blame the victim.
I'm just so sick of roller skating's dangerous image.
We're not all bad boys.
Yeah, none.
All right, Gina, get your stuff.
I'm taking you to the dentist.
No, no, no, no.
I'll go alone.
I don't need anyone's help.
Just order me an UberSELEC or better.
And despite our natural desire to stop everything, you'd like us to soldier on in your absence and keep the heist going?
Yeah, that's fine.
Well, you heard the lady.
She insists we continue.
Let's mop up this blood and get back at it.
With all due respect, sir, I don't think that's the best idea.
The blood is dry.
We can just clean it up after.
Oh, agreed.
Ah, I love tonight.
However, there is the small issue of me losing my partner.
Now, Terry, I know that you were upset that no one picked you earlier.
Not what happened.
Regardless, please be my partner, please, please, please, please, please, please.
No!
Heists are dumb, and I have work to do.
You're dumb, and I have heist to do.
Overreacted.
Damn it!
You know what?
Forget Terry.
At the time of the accident, my team had the plaque, so I will just grab it and give myself a four-minute head start.
Not so fast, Peralta.
I say we reset the plaque and start over.
What?
But my team had it.
Charles, tell him.
No, Jake.
We're resetting.
Charles, what are you saying?
The plaque goes Back!
Yes, Pork Chop.
Yes.
I have eyes on Kristy, Stacey, and Claudia.
You used their code names.
You read the plans, addenda and all!
Damn right, I did.
I told you, I'm all in.
And you didn't make fun of me for basing it all on "The Baby-Sitters Club".
And I even did your suggested reading of "Kristy's Big Day".
You did?
Calm down.
You're such a Mary Anne.
I am!
It's true!
So, Boyle, I was impressed with how you stood up to Peralta and demanded a reset.
Ha!
I'm Team Holt all the way, baby.
Also, I'm pretty upset with him for letting Gina sweat up my skates.
Well, perhaps I can use a teammate after all.
Do you swear I can trust you?
Yes.
I swear.
Let's unleash hell.
Thanks for coming back, Bill.
I really needed a teammate.
Hey, man, you're paying.
Yeah.
You can take the wig off if you want.
Whatever you want, man.
You're paying.
Could you stop saying that, Bill?
It's making me a little uncomfortable.
All right, man.
It's your money.
That's the same thing.
What is this?
It's a jack-o'-lantern.
Don't touch it.
Why not?
Because you're hiding something in there?
Because my daughters made it and your palms are all black.
What have you been touching?
Huh!
Well, this has got me stumped.
I got a pizza here for Raymond Holt.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Holt hates pizza.
He's trying to distract us.
Oh, if I were trying to distract you, I would have sent you the pizza.
This is your doing, you and your male prostitute.
Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think.
I have a pizza here for Raymond Holt.
What's going on?
Both: I have a pizza here for Raymond Holt.
Which one of you bozos did this?
Us?
You know how much planning it takes to get this many pizza guys here at the same time?
A binder full of planning.
This has Amy written all over it.
If I had done this, it would say "Captain Raymond Holt".
I'm not going to disrespect you, sir, even for the sake of the heist.
I'll guard the plaque!
You're not leaving my sight.
Bill, can you see what's going on?
Do you have eyes on Charles and Rosa?
I don't know who anybody is.
There's too much pizza!
I see Holt.
I see Charles.
Where's Terry?
Terry's leaving, because Terry's got work to do.
Hitchcock!
Scully!
Follow Terry!
Both: On it!
Aah!
I'm getting bounced around like a pinball!
- This is madness!
- Who hired you?
Who do you work for, pizza man?
Everyone with a pizza, get out of here!
-  The caboodle!
- The caboodle!
The "ca-boo-dale"!
I know one of you took the plaque.
And I swear on my living mother's future grave, I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
Or it was you, Jake.
You love pizza.
It's true.
You had it for breakfast this morning.
When pizza's on a bagel, you can eat pizza anytime!
Well, it certainly wasn't Boyle and me.
We were out here the whole time.
Plus, we already ate.
Autumn salads with farm-fresh squash.
That's right, I'm catering for our team.
Look who I found hiding in the interrogation room: this guilty son of a bitch.
Still your sergeant.
Look, I wasn't hiding.
I was doing my work.
Hitchcock and Scully were with me.
Were they, or perhaps were they distracted by your brilliant pizza ruse?
Totally distracted.
I ate two whole pies.
Folded 'em up like tacos.
You're suspect number one, Jeffords.
- Whatever.
- "Whatever".
Spoken like a common criminal.
Still a long time till sunup.
All I have to say is, whoever took that plaque, you better watch out.
Come on, Rosa.
- Come on, Boyle.
- Yes, sir.
Come on Bill.
Okay, was the operation a success?
- You tell me.
-  Blended right in with the pizza guys.
Got out my bolt cutters.
Lock snapped on the first try.
No one saw me leave.
Got to hand it to you beautiful plan.
Beautiful execution.
It's kind of like we're our own baby-sitters club.
Oh, my God, I don't want tonight to ever end.
Did you by chance read the excerpt from "The Truth About Stacey"?
The one about the rival baby-sitters That get caught smoking cigarettes?
Well, let's just say that these two baby-sitters aren't getting caught with squat.
This is where I stash a few cigarettes on the rare occasion that I need a puff.
Dope.
The hiding place, not the smoking.
Mary Anne is better than that.
She's a work in progress.
This is so frustrating.
There's no way of knowing who has the plaque.
- Amy and Rosa have it.
- What?
How do you know?
Diaz usually favors her left leg, but after "zero dark pizza," she was suddenly favoring her right.
Yes, yes, which means that she was You trailed off and didn't finish speaking.
Continue.
I don't want to.
Her gait was thrown off because she was carrying the plaque.
And I know exactly where it's hidden: in Santiago's secret cigarette stash.
How did you find that?
Whenever she gets stressed out, she smokes.
And it's almost too easy to stress her out.
Oh, Santiago, I Never mind.
What is it?
What?
I got to go.
Bing-pot.
And now it's time to send in our cute little secret weapon.
I'm ready, Captain.
I love the nickname.
No, Charles, not you.
I was talking about Cheddar.
Oh, right, obviously.
Over the past month, I've had him trained to retrieve plaques.
And now, boy, it's time to make Daddy proud.
Yes, sir.
I could not have been more clearly talking to the dog.
Time is running out.
We got to stop playing by the rules and start playing dirty.
Follow my lead, Bill.
Okay, but first I should tell you my safe word is "cabbage".
Why?
You know what?
Never mind.
It doesn't matter.
Hey, Charles!
Charles, get in here.
Come on.
What is Holt up to?
Does he have the plaque?
Does he know who does?
I'm not telling you that, Jake.
I'm Team Holt, and there's nothing you could say that will change that.
Okay, fine, then I guess I have a new best friend, and his name is Bill.
You're not serious.
He's just a prop for the heist.
Sure, it started out that way, but you know how these things go, spending time together, sharing intimate secrets, laughing about nothing in particular.
-  - Cabbage.
Holt has the plaque.
It's hidden in the evidence room in a box marked "Cold Cases 1972".
Thanks, bud.
We will always be best friends.
You hear that, Bill?
Nobody likes you!
Ain't she a beaut?
Sexy.
Immediately ruined it, Bill.
Immediately.
Here you go.
Chht, chht, chht, chh What is happening right now?
The last sands are running through the hourglass chh, chh, chh because your time is running out, and you are never going to get the plaque.
Oh, Captain, stop.
I just can't let you embarrass yourself.
I told Jake everything.
He threatened to replace me, and I freaked out hard.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
I knew you would betray me.
That's why I fed you fake Intel.
Both: What?
The plaque was never in "Cold Cases 1972".
As if I'd just put it in a box, unattended.
Uh, but you did.
No, I didn't.
Then how do you explain this?
I have no idea.
I put the plaque in my office.
Cheddar?
Come here.
Come here.
Come here, baby.
- What the hell?
- Yeah, thank you.
Return to my office, please.
What's up, you little turds?
Wait, what is going on?
We have the plaque.
Yeah, I just got it out of the vent to rub it in your faces.
"I Just Got It Out of the Vent to Rub It in Your Faces".
Name of your sex tape.
What?
Something strange is afoot.
Which of these is real?
Black lights.
What the hell?
Oh, my God.
Our precinct is disgusting.
Dear God.
Hitchcock and Scully's desk.
- All: Ugh!
- Wait.
Look at the plaques.
- "Are".
- "Heists".
"Dumb".
Are heists dumb?
Of course not.
That was a stupid question.
No, Jake, it's says, "Heists are dumb".
all: Terry!
The Oscar for best liar goes to you!
That's not an Oscars category.
What's going on?
Not to be harsh, Sarge, but you're setting a terrible example for your daughters, and they're gonna grow up to be total failures.
You take that back.
No, she's right, Jeffords.
Your children are doomed.
Where's the plaque?
For the last time, I don't know.
I've been working here the whole time.
Ask them.
Well, actually, we both fell asleep.
And Jeffords never woke us up.
Coincidence?
I don't need this.
You're not going anywhere.
- Damn, Rosa!
-  He's trying to get away!
Everyone start panicking!
He had someone lock the door.
'Sup, losers?
I have the real plaque!
Unh, unh!
Gina!
Of course!
It all makes sense, except for the parts I don't understand and the fact that I still kind of think Terry did this.
Nope, it was all me.
Three weeks ago, Captain Holt asked me to order a plaque that read, "The Ultimate Detective/Genius".
I did it, and I ordered three copies and a statue of Tyrese riding a dolphin.
- Is that relevant?
- To my life, yes.
Once I had the plaques, I manipulated Captain Holt into choosing Boyle as his partner.
All it took was six bottles of dish soap.
See, this is what happens when Jake tries to wash dishes by himself.
It's like he's helpless without Boyle.
Yes.
He is helpless without Boyle.
And you fell for my trap like a greedy little rat.
Easy.
Yes, it was easy.
And the next phase of my plan: a "skating accident".
But you knocked out your two front teeth.
False teeth.
Fake blood.
I lost my real teeth at Jenn Sutton's birthday party in fourth grade.
Oh, you made sure I didn't remember that!
It was minute five of seven minutes in heaven with Todd Cohen when he bumped the wall and a bowling ball fell on my face.
Maybe I just wasn't at that party.
Once I had faked the skating mishap, I swapped out a dummy plaque for the real one.
Then I left to go to the dentist.
And you convinced your dentist to help you carry out the rest of the heist.
- No.
- Of course not.
Go ahead.
I came back, wearing the perfect disguise to make sure I was never noticed by anyone.
Something so drab and uninspiring This feels like it's gonna be a dig on me.
- I wore Amy's clothes.
- There it is.
This is your doing, you and your male prostitute.
Bill is not a male prostitute, I don't think.
That suit is not drab.
It has a fun salmon lining.
No, Amy, it made me invisible.
And now that I had that power, every time one of you stole a plaque, I replaced it with a fake.
And no one had any idea until the lights went out, revealing a secret message: "Heists are dumb".
Then we raced in here to blame Terry, and you trapped us.
But how did you know he was gonna say "heists are dumb"?
Terry says that about everything.
Everyone should wear suspenders.
Belts are dumb.
People should swim forward.
The backstroke is dumb.
30 grams of fat?
Hummus is dumb.
And now here you all are, locked up behind the glass like a bunch of loser fish.
I bet you're wondering why I did it.
Because you wanted to win?
No!
I had a loftier goal in mind.
Can you do me a favor and tell me what that says right there?
"The Ultimate Detective/Genius".
Detective.
Can you imagine what that word sounds like to someone who's not a detective?
Discriminatory.
It's worse than segregation.
- Both: Uh-uh.
- Too far?
I'm sorry.
But I think I've proved a point, and that's why we're changing the name of the plaque forever!
To what?
All: Gina Linetti is the ultimate human/genius.
Thank you.
And now I'd like to say a few words.
You talked for, like, an hour when you had us locked in that interrogation room.
I'm a fair ruler.
Your comment has been heard.
But seriously, you guys, I just want to say, I freaking love you losers.
Happy Halloween.
All: Happy Halloween!
Take out your teeth.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
All: Take out your teeth!
Take out your teeth!
Take out your teeth!
Oh!
I'm invincible!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Papa, Papa, come in here!
Hey, Papa's here.
Papa, I'm so scared.
There's a monster in my closet.
Oh, buddy.
Shh.
It's okay, I'm here.
Monster's aren't real, my little pierogi.
But I saw it.
It was big and hairy.
You just had a nightmare, buddy.
No, it was real!
I'm sure it felt that way.
But I am gonna open this closet, and I'm gonna show you that there's nothing in there.
Don't do that, Papa!
See?
Nothing  -  - Whoo!
Ah, hey, Chuck.
It's Pimento.
And now Nikolaj says he's too frightened to ever sleep again, so that's just superduper.
I don't understand what he's so scared about.
If I was there to kill him, he never would've heard me.
A thing you told him several times.
God, Nikolaj is having such a rich childhood.
Can we back up?
What were you doing in Boyle's closet - in the first place?
- Well, I still had a key from when I was crashing there last year, and I wanted to shower and anoint my body with essential oils before I saw Rosa.
Duh.
Well, she's gonna be so psyched that you're back.
Where have you been all this time?
Figgis has been locked up for a month.
I was in prison in Uzbekistan.
It's actually not as bad as it sounds.
I deserve this!
Why were you in jail?
Ah, I got shot down smuggling ammo to a rebel group, flying an old Soviet prop plane.
They tortured us.
Made me eat my co-pilot's tongue.
Oof, now I've got a taste for it.
The important thing is you're safe and sound and back in Brooklyn.
Thank you, Captain.
-  -  Ooh, you smell good!
Wowza.
- And end of hug.
- Okay.
I'll see about getting you reinstated to the NYPD immediately.
I think this deserves another hug.
- Me too.
- Nope.
- One was sufficient.
- Cool.
Pimento, you son of a bitch!
You're the son of a bitch!
Oh, we'll see who's a son of a bitch.
Oh, yes, we will.
-  - Aww.
It's so sweet.
And violent.
Yeah, this is awkward.
I'm sure they'll stop soon.
And it's escalating.
Let's go.
I left my phone in the briefing room.
It's been 20 minutes.
You think they're still They're not doing anything.
Kissing just turned into talk.
It's like, why even work here?
Listen up!
We have an announcement to make.
When I was in that Uzbek prison, choking on my own blood because my face was being beaten in, I realized, life is funny!
That's what you realized?
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's short.
We're picking up where we left off when Adrian went into hiding.
We're getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
That's real quick.
Thank you, Sarge.
And we want it to be beautiful, and lush, and romantic, just like a Nancy Meyers movie.
- She's our favorite director.
- Aw.
I love "You've Got Mail".
- That's Nora Ephron, you idiot.
- I know.
Wait, hold up.
Planning a wedding like that in 14 hours would be the greatest organizational challenge in history.
How are you gonna do it?
I was kinda hoping you would.
I thought I was supposed to get you guys the wedding present!
- Of course I will!
- That's my girl.
All right.
Listen up, people.
The next 14 hours are gonna be hell, but in the end you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you've finally done something worthwhile - with your lives.
- I kinda think - the police work we do - Eh-eh-eh!
I don't have time to stroke your damn ego, Sergeant.
Let's make a wedding!
Hey, Jake.
I need a wedding favor.
Of course.
Anything.
Except killing someone, or maiming someone, or breaking the law in any way, or nudity.
Also I don't like waking up super early in the morning you know what, why don't you just tell me what you want?
Cool, I need to go to Neustadter, New York.
I gotta pick up a pair of ruby earrings I pawned before I went into hiding.
Neustadter's like six hours away.
I'm not so sure we can get there and back in time.
Jake, there's no wedding without the earrings.
My grandmother wore them on her wedding day, and said they blessed her union.
Do you want this union to be blessed, Jake?
Or do you want this union to be friggin' unblessed?
Blessed, totally blessed.
I'll do it, it's fine.
But I should warn you, my car is a piece of junk - and it's always breaking down.
- Ah, come on!
The universe isn't gonna let anything bad happen to two best friends unless we're in a fiery crash, and our bodies are burned beyond recognition.
Ooh, Gina's got jelly beans!
Pimento, no.
- Bad.
- Sorry, Gina.
That was amazing.
He actually listens to you.
Hey, you should come with us on this trip.
You know, in case he starts acting - Bat crap loony tunes.
- Yes.
You can use your powers to keep him in check.
- Yeah, people fear me.
- Mm.
The only reason I'm not your boss right now is 'cause I'd hate to do that to Holt.
- He needs this.
- And also you're not a cop.
Well, you're not the basis of a character on "Empire," Jake, but I don't throw that in your face every damn day.
- So you will come with us?
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- You da man!
- Bye, girl!
See ya in the car, girl.
Okay.
First, the good news.
I've generated a detailed timeline broken down into 30-second increments to keep us on track.
The bad news: we're already 16.5 increments - behind schedule.
- Oh, man.
Terry feels overwhelmed.
Good!
Use it!
Neil Armstrong was overwhelmed when he walked on the Moon, but you know what he did?
He walked on the Moon!
Charles, you're in charge of food.
I've been planning a nuptial menu since the day I met Genevieve.
Warning, it will be delicious and highly erotic.
Your menu is not gonna involve animal genitalia, is it?
No, I was gonna make not that.
Terry, you're on hair and makeup.
I've seen your little girls' pigtails, so I know you can do it.
They actually prefer my hair work to their mommy's.
I love their little heads.
-  - Terry, what's going on, man?
It's just a matter of time before I'm doing their hair at their weddings.
It goes so fast.
They're still babies!
Pull it together, Jeffords!
Scully and Hitchcock, you're in charge of seating.
Smart move, Amy.
I've been called the Leonardo da Vinci of sitting on my ass.
Great.
And, Captain, you can help me decorate.
I'm at your disposal, just tell me what to do.
I'm here to implement your vision.
Well, we just wanna keep it classy.
Got it.
Balloon arch.
- What?
- Say no more, it's done.
I'm off to the nearest balloon store.
Okay, Rosa.
You go to the office, have a couple bellinis, - and just relax.
- What's a Bellini?
Peach juice and champagne.
Peach juice and champagne?
What am I, six?
Come on, just try it.
It's what Nancy Meyers would drink.
Fine.
For Nancy.
So, big day.
How you feeling, buddy?
Good, giddy.
I've never felt giddy before.
Didn't realize how close it was to hungry.
You know, it's possible you're just hungry.
- When's the last time you ate?
- Uh, three days ago?
- Ah.
- You excited for being married?
Yeah!
I love Rosa.
I can't wait to just jam my tongue in her earholes, and eat the hair off her head.
- Hoo!
I'm giddy.
- Aw, that's cute.
All right, we're looking for 381 Smith Street.
It should be up here.
Hopefully they still have your earrings.
You sure we're looking for 381?
'Cause 381's looking a little crispy.
Oh, no.
It burned down.
How did this happen?
Uh, it's okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We'll think of something, all right?
Nope!
This is a sign from the universe.
I can't marry Rosa.
Guys, the wedding's off.
Oh, no, no, no!
That's it!
We're not getting married.
- This is a disaster.
- Come on.
I mean, they're just earrings, right?
We can get another pair, or we could make some new ones.
All we need is, like, a blacksmith.
Or a smelter a smelt man.
That can't be right.
The point is you can still married.
No, Jake.
You don't understand.
The universe is sending me a sign.
And when the universe talks, I listen!
Well, I personally don't even really believe in signs, so What?
Then you deserve to die.
- Ah - The sign was real.
If I ignore it and marry Rosa anyway, I'm basically asking the universe to stomp on my balls.
Okay, good point.
Hey, Gina, I could use your help here.
You wanna maybe weigh in on this one?
Yeah, sure.
You're right.
The marriage is cursed.
What?
No!
You weighed in wrong.
I'm sorry, Jake, it's an omen.
And I'm not taking your side against the universe's.
- It's hundred of years old.
- What if there was something in the universe that could prove to you that you should still get married?
What would that be?
Finding his grandma's earrings.
Or we could cut Rosa's ears off, and then it's like the earrings don't even make sense.
Thank you!
Someone's trying to help.
Okay, so the earrings.
Maybe somebody bought them before the place burned down, right?
We could track 'em down.
And lookee here.
I just got the owner's name.
That's good, right?
Okay, maybe there is a little bit of hope.
You're damn right there is.
Suck it, universe!
- Are you crazy?
- Why would you even say that?
Come on, man!
How are the chairs coming, guys?
Shh.
We're working!
- This one's good.
- Okay.
- So we'll go with that one?
- No, I said it was good.
I didn't say it was right.
Wow, you're taking this really seriously.
Amy, will you taste this batter?
Mm-hmm.
Hmm I think it's a little off.
You know what's off?
Your mouth!
Why Jake lets your stupid tongue anywhere near him, I'll never know.
Nope, I forgot the sugar.
That's on me.
Whoa, you really made the balloon arch.
Made?
No.
I birthed her.
There's no form more graceful than the arch, no object more whimsical than the balloon.
Yes, you and I think that, but what will Rosa think?
Good point.
Rosa would want a much, much bigger balloon arch.
Back to the balloon store.
Uh, Amy?
We've got a problem.
- What?
- Rosa's drunk.
Rosa?
No.
How?
Bellinis rule!
Nancy Meyers, you've done it again, you saucy bitch.
For the last time, I don't have your earrings.
They didn't survive the fire.
Aw, no, this is really bad.
Well, not necessarily.
I mean, maybe the universe allowed something else to survive, you know?
- Like a rabbit's foot.
- I don't think you understand - how pawn shops work.
- I don't think you understand how they work.
Yours burned down!
I'm so sorry you lost everything.
I'm just really worked up.
No, please don't!
Okay, so I know that seemed like a little bit of a dead end.
-  - She's got the earrings.
- She does?
- She stole all the merch, and then burned down the store.
She was wearing a necklace that I also pawned there.
Oh, snap!
Signs on signs on signs!
Are you sure it's the same necklace?
Uh, yeah, Jake.
I once punched it through a guy's throat, so I'm pretty sure - I remember it.
- I stand corrected.
All right, I'm gonna call the local police - and get a warrant.
- Oh, don't bother.
Let's just kick down the door, and take back what's mine.
No!
No, no, no.
That's a bad idea.
He's right.
Just use the lattice.
The upstairs window's open.
- No!
- Nice!
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to make this wedding happen.
What are you doing?
Trying to keep us out of prison.
You know what, forget it.
I'll just deal with him myself nope, he's already on the roof.
Aha!
Yeah, dog!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
- Rosa, what happened?
- Sorry.
I didn't know you could drunk off champers.
- I mean, it's half bubbles.
- Don't worry, Amy.
I got this.
I'm a master at sobering up.
- Are you sure?
- Uh, you don't go to the Renaissance Faire every weekend in your 20s without learning how to handle your mead.
Great.
Thanks, Charles.
Mm-hmm.
Charles, I'm getting married today.
Yes, you are.
And I'm gonna make sure you are sober when that happens.
Now I just need cayenne pepper - and some horse milk.
- Marriage is the best.
Hey, how come you and Genevieve aren't married?
- Huh?
- Uh - you know, it's complicated.
- No, it's not.
It's easy.
Bring her down here.
- We'll all get married!
- Yeah, right.
- She doesn't want that.
- Whoa, that sounds -  - No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
Uh-uh, no, no.
Everything's great with us.
I mean, if it was up to me, we'd get hitched, but she had a really bad divorce, so Oh, I'm sorry.
Does that upset you?
I'm good!
Yeah, I'm good!
I'm so sad.
I love her so much.
I wanna marry her butt so bad.
- To Genevieve's butt!
- To Genevieve's butt!
Look at all this crap.
See, I told you.
They took all their merchandise, and burned their store.
This is a bad idea.
We should leave now.
What?
No.
All we're gonna do is find the earrings, and then light this place on fire for revenge.
Check it out!
Rainstick.
- Keeping it.
- No, you're not.
- That is a crime.
- Untrue.
Once you steal something, none of your stuff belongs to you.
- I've heard that too.
- No, you haven't.
No one has.
Put that down.
Okay.
Gina!
Be a quieter robber!
But you told me to put it down.
Hi, we met earlier.
You're breaking into my house?
Or are you breaking into our house?
- Yeah.
- Dino!
Robbers!
Dino!
Aha!
I found the earrings!
Dino!
Get up here!
Yeah, Dino!
Get in here!
So you can watch me light your house on fire!
Whoa!
Okay, everybody, just keep it cool.
Everybody be chilly chill chill.
I am gonna slice your face off!
- Not chill, Dino.
-  Let me in there, you sons of bitches!
Wait, wait!
The trellis won't hold all three of us at the same time.
Smart.
- Whoo!
- Ooh!
That was awesome!
I love being a police officer!
That was the opposite of being a police officer.
- We just robbed somebody.
- Who robbed us!
The universe is back on track, baby!
We got grandma's earrings back!
And the rainstick!
- Which you will be returning.
- Uh, sure I will.
How are we doing on traffic?
- Green all the way.
- All right, looks like we're actually gonna make it in time for this wedding.
Thank you, universe.
Thank you for blessing this marriage.
Okay, I know what you're thinking, but this is not a sign.
I just have to pump the gas twice, and turn it back on.
This happens all the time.
Oh, boy.
This has never happened before.
Everybody out!
This is the worst day of my life.
The universe doesn't want me to marry Rosa.
Look, it's gonna be fine.
We'll get the car fixed and make it back in time.
Gina, when's the tow truck getting here?
No idea, I'm talking to my spiritual advisor.
He says we have an engine problem.
Yeah, I know, that's why I said call a tow truck!
So you meant my spiritual advisor is right?
Guys!
This is my fault.
I should've just given up when fate burned down the pawn shop, okay?
Stupid Adrian.
Stupid Adrian!
- Idiot!
Read the signs!
- Enough!
I'm so sick of this garbage, all right?
The two of you need to stop looking for signs everywhere oh, my God, a sign.
Whoo!
He can fly!
Prop planes!
You can fly, you can fly!
I'm a vessel for the universe.
Wow.
The chairs look amazing.
I can't believe you two aren't my biggest problem today.
We're not?
Who is?
My arch.
Isn't she beautiful?
I got eye-rolled to, not about!
While Pimento stares at Rosa, we'll all be staring at her.
- Yes, we will.
- She's truly breathtaking.
There's a double meaning to that.
The breath that it takes to inflate all those balloons.
Of course I used the hand pump, but the bon mot still works.
-  - Oh, no!
What's happening?
Someone tell me what's happening.
- I got some more bad news.
- Oh.
Oh, wow.
That thing's huge.
Didn't Rosa want things to be classy?
I mean, she's getting married, not finishing a marathon.
So says the hair guy.
Stay in your lane, bucko.
Right, Santiago?
The arch sucks!
I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say anything because you're my boss and you were so excited, but the truth is every time I look at it I wanna die and take you with me.
Well, I wish you'd said something before I spent all day making it.
Of course, you didn't want to "burst my bubble".
Pun intended.
And then you did.
Forget the arch!
Charles didn't sober up Rosa.
- She got him drunk!
- Oh, no.
How drunk is he?
Remember the night they cancelled "Bunheads"?
- We're ruined.
- It's fine.
I'll handle it.
You got your hands full.
Yeah.
This is just 18 shots of espresso.
It got me through the first three months of having twins, but I imagine it'll sober you up too.
Aww, he's taking care of you.
Such a good father.
Ugh, I miss my father.
I used to be daddy's little girl, but we never talk anymore.
- You don't?
- That's what happens.
You grow up, your bond with your dad goes -  -  No, it doesn't always happen.
All right, not to special daddies who put the time in.
You know, read them stories, do their little pigtails.
Really, Sarge?
Who do you think used to do my pigtails?
Why can't they stay babies forever?
Berlini!
- Bellini!
- Bellini!
Okay, this is very scary, but it's okay, because you're a trained pilot.
No, I'm not.
I'm self-taught.
- What?
- Oh, yeah.
You can learn anything online.
Ooh, you should see me do origami.
Oh, do you know how to do a frog?
Oh, no!
- Can you do a swan?
- No.
- Can you do a crane?
- What's a crane?
Okay, he does not know how to fly a plane.
All right, food is ready, decorations are set, guests should start arriving any moment, and the chairs are still perfection.
She said they're perfection.
I'm so proud of you, buddy.
It was you.
You made this happen.
All right!
Let's show Rosa what we got.
Wait.
Where is Rosa?
Narc.
And that's why you shouldn't drink.
Being drunk sounds terrible.
Hello, Amy, I didn't see you there.
- How did the wedding go?
- Terry!
What the hell, man?
You said you were gonna - sober them up.
- It was her fault.
My girls are never gonna grow up and lose their virginity.
I lost my V-card to the woman that refilled Nana's oxygen tanks.
Her hands were so strong from turning the nozzles.
-  - This is a room of nightmares.
You're the nightmare.
You made me kill my balloon baby.
Look at me.
So drunk, I'm alliterating like a beatnik.
Okay, everybody outside now!
Just know that you brought this on yourselves.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Can't we just go to sleep for a winker?
We're way past winkers.
Scully, Hitchcock, bring the frost.
- No!
-   Nice job, you two.
We are nailing it today!
Hey!
We're back.
Pimento's got the earrings, guests are arriving - What the hell are you doing?
- Sobering these clowns up.
All right, everyone go get dressed.
-  - You would not believe - the day I've had.
- You and me both, sister.
Rosa got drunk, and then every time I sent someone in to help her, she got them drunk too!
It's like she was trying to tank this thing.
Yeah, well, Pimento called off the wedding three times because of the universe.
If I didn't know them any better, I'd think they don't even wanna get married.
Both: They don't wanna get married!
Okay, so it seems like they don't wanna get married.
But is it even our place to say something?
- No, right?
- Right?
It's their decision, even if it's a bad one.
They could always get divorced.
People love getting divorced!
My parents got divorced, and all it did was scar our family for years and years.
- We have to say something.
- Yeah.
I suppose I can see how a balloon arch - might've been a little too much.
- Oh, yeah, for sure.
No, you're supposed to say, "This wedding looks like garbage".
This wedding looks like garbage.
No, no.
As long as the bride's happy.
Hey there, everyone.
Great wedding so far, right?
Uh, next up, we're gonna take a quick break, which happens at every wedding, but in the meantime, how about a little entertainment?
Boyle?
You got your devil sticks?
Always.
- Hey, Adrian.
- Yeah.
- We gotta talk.
- Really?
Right now?
I'm working on my vows.
Hey!
What rhymes with juicy heinie?
Nothing.
Nothing rhymes with that.
- I would cut that line.
- But that's all I have.
Forget it.
The thing I wanna say is, maybe the universe wasn't telling you stuff today.
Maybe you were telling yourself something.
- Telling myself what?
- Yeah, tell himself what?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a part of this journey.
Don't you dare try to cut me out.
Wow, you look beautiful.
Thanks, Amy.
I'm super nervous.
- Kinda wish I was still drunk.
- Yeah.
About that I think we should talk.
Why?
Are you packing a Bellini?
Look, I spent the whole day denying the fact that there were signs, but I was wrong.
- They were actually there.
- So far, duh.
The fact that you kept cancelling your own wedding - that was the real sign.
- Whoa!
You took the situation, and you flippity-flopped it.
I don't think it was an accident that you got drunk, or that you got everyone else drunk.
What?
You think I'm trying to sabotage my own wedding?
I don't know.
Were you?
Maybe I was.
I don't know, something just doesn't feel right.
Oh, man, I gotta talk to Adrian.
I was my own sign the whole time?
Wow, that's a real M. Night Shyamalan twist the oh!
"Signs"!
Wait, do you think he's behind all of this?
I do not.
I should go talk to Rosa.
Thanks, Jake.
Jake, you done good, kid.
Glad I took you along for the ride.
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup!
All right, give it up for Charles.
Yeah!
No, give it up for the devil sticks.
- They're the real heroes here.
- No, they are not.
No one thinks that.
All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?
Oh, I do!
- Two Jews walk into a - No!
Sit down!
No, definitely not.
Oh!
All right, we have an announcement to make.
- We're not getting married.
- All: Aww!
You can shove those "awws" up your butts.
Yeah, or I'll come out there, and I'll do it for ya!
What an interesting event.
I just feel like we were rushing things.
We love each other, but we haven't even really spent that much time together.
We've never even been on a real date, so we're gonna start there.
Shut up!
Thank you for the presents.
We're keeping them.
- All of them.
- Yeah, if you got a problem with it, come talk to us in the parking lot.
Also, in just 14 hours Amy put together the most amazing non-wedding wedding in history.
Better than "Sleepless in Seattle".
Nope.
That is also Nora Ephron.
- Kill yourself.
- Don't take it personally.
Anyway, we can't let all this go to waste.
Everybody, clear these chairs out of here, and let's get - this party started.
- No, not the chairs!
Don't touch the chairs, you monsters!
- Yeah?
- Oh, I just wanted to thank you - for all your help yesterday.
- I didn't do much.
It was nothing.
- Good day.
- What's going on?
I'm just very busy.
Get back to work.
Wait.
What do you have in there?
A balloon arch.
Oh, my God, Captain.
She is magnificent.
Vindication!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to answer and age-old question.
Right, what's Amy's deal?
She single?
No, we're dating.
Come on.
The question is: Who here does the best impression of Captain Raymond Holt?
You'll be judged on voice, body language, and overall lack of flair.
Everyone will perform the same scenario: Captain Holt eating a marshmallow for the very first time.
Let the Holt-off begin!
What is this glutinous monstrosity before me?
The sugar in this is quite sweet.
Ooh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm-hmm-hmm!
That's your Holt impression?
I can hear him doing that.
Looks like a sticky pillow.
I don't care for it.
Classical music.
What's going on here?
What are you doing?
Captain, hey, nothing, just eating some marshmallows.
Care for one?
Marshed-mallow.
Hmm.
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!
I knew it!
That concludes our briefing.
And now, on a personal note, I have some thoughts about BeyoncÃ©'s "Lemonade" - I'd like to share.
- Oh, my God, sir, as much as I want to hear those thoughts, and it is so, so much, I think we should probably let Amy speak.
Oh, Santiago, the floor is yours.
Thank you.
Okay, here's everyone's itineraries for Thanksgiving at my place.
I know a lot of your families are out of town, and you just want to relax, but I think we'll all enjoy ourselves more if we rigidly stick to the schedule.
Whoa, did you assign us individual bathroom break times?
Keep asking questions about it, Sarge, and your slot is after Scully's.
All right, Santiago, damn.
It's your toilet.
Sorry, it's just that my dad is coming into town, and he can be a little uptight.
Uh-oh, Santiago's calling someone uptight.
That can't be good.
He's not crazy.
He's just the kind of guy who arranges the money in his wallet according to serial number.
Yeah.
That kind of guy.
Boyle, are you set on the turkey?
This year's bird will be as moist as - Nope.
- As juicy as - Nope.
- As wet as you can Boyle, just say it'll be good, man.
It'll be good, man.
Well, I gotta go start getting ready.
Don't be late or I'll slit your throats.
You don't have to fake laugh.
We know you mean it.
Good.
So, meeting Amy's dad for the first time, huh?
- You nervous?
- Yeah, a little.
- I was talking to Jake.
- No, Sarge, I am not nervous.
I'm confident that I'll make a great first impression on Mr. Victor Santiago.
Why'd you do it with a British accent?
I felt like doing the Cuban accent would be a little dicey for me.
- Very good call.
- Yeah.
My advice: don't be overconfident.
The first time I met Kevin's parents, I called Brahm's "Funf Gesange" opus 106 when it is, obviously, opus 104.
They haven't spoken to me since.
Really?
Just for that?
Yes also because they're huge homophobes who think that I made Kevin gay with my magic genitalia.
That's super sad, but I do like hearing you say the word "genitalia".
Well, I am ready for this.
I pulled a full Amy and researched the crap out of him.
Made this sweet binder.
Just a couple of factoids about Victor: He's an ex-cop, 65 years old, married for 36 years, Cuban, his favorite food Flavor First beefy dog food.
Wait, no, sorry.
That's his dog's favorite food.
His favorite food is corn.
Makes more sense.
Dog food's not in the name.
I know everything about him, therefore I know exactly the type of person I need to be in order for him to think - I'm good enough for Amy.
- No, Jake, you're fine.
Just flash him your baby browns, he'll love it.
Just be yourself.
Be myself?
Charles, I have one day to win over Amy's dad.
How long did it take before you guys started liking me?
- Couple weeks.
- Six months.
- Jury's still out.
- See, Charles?
"Be myself," what kind of garbage advice is that?
I hope you're not telling Nikolaj that crap.
-  - Nikolaj.
Ugh.
Okay, we're running out of time.
What do you guys like better: classic bishop hat fold or crown fold?
Now, the crown is more showy, but the bishop hat has a certain dignity.
I'll kill myself if it's not the crown fold.
Oh, okay, thanks.
Sometimes you have to pretend to care about napkins to stop hearing about napkins.
Sorry I'm late, guys.
Had to get my ax sharpened.
Why do you have an ax?
Also, nice ax.
Thank you.
It's for the turkey, so I can chop its head off when it gets here.
- Chop its head off?
- I ordered a live turkey.
It's being delivered.
Because you know what they say: The yummiest turkey is the one that just died in your hands.
Charles, you can't kill an animal in here.
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.
We won't let you do it, right, Amy?
It's getting late.
Don't make a mess.
Relax.
It's not the first turkey I've killed in a friend's bathtub.
It isn't?
And now back to the Lexington Thanksgiving Day Dog Show.
Oh, look at her.
Sloping, clean-cut, forequarters, cocksure gait.
She's majestic, and she knows it.
- Pimento's here.
- Ah, Adrian.
So you made it.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Is it?
Something wrong?
Feel no pressure to talk about it.
Brass says I can't rejoin the force.
Some crap about you can't just disappear from your job for seven months, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Oh, well, that's unfortunate.
I know how much being a cop meant to you.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I guess I could be a teacher.
"Sorry, Travis, the answer's "obviously Istanbul.
What did you say to me?
"No, maybe you're wasting your life.
"Sorry, Principal Ramos, I didn't see you there.
"Wait, Travis is your son?
Hah, well, I guess you're "just gonna have to fire me.
Fired?
Me?
How dare you, sir.
We will settle" See, it just wouldn't work.
Hmm.
You know, I had a friend that had to retire from the force.
He became a private investigator.
Ooh, PI, huh?
- Mm.
- I like that.
"Hello, Mr. Branville, "I found out where your wife's been going tonight.
"Have a seat, you're not gonna like this.
"She's cheating on you.
"What do you mean you knew that already?
"You killed her?
"And are framing me for the murder?
"I just left my prints all over the crime scene.
Oh, you are an evil ge" This this I could get on board for.
- Hmm.
- Only problem is, PI license is like, two grand.
I could lend you the money.
Think of it as an investment from someone who believes in you.
Wow, thanks, Captain.
That means every Whoa, hang on, you carry a check book with you?
'Course, you never know when you're gonna need groceries.
So cool.
-  - Where are you?
Picking up Amy's dad at the airport.
Ooh, that's a strong move.
Have you successfully changed everything about yourself as planned?
Oh, yeah, you wouldn't recognize me.
I'm wearing a sweater, I bought new shoes, I put something on my face called "moisturizer".
- It's amazing.
- Did you clean your car?
I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part: I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.
Who has a favorite font?
The Santiagos do.
All of them.
Oh, here he comes.
Gotta go, bye.
Hey, Mr. Santiago.
I am Jake Peralta, Amy's boyfriend.
Jake, nice to finally meet you.
- You too.
- Ah, look at that.
You're a Garamond man, huh?
Of course, what other font would I use, Cambria?
Amy said you were a crack up, but I had no idea.
- Oh, it's working.
- What?
Excuse me?
Shall we?
- Let me get your bag.
- Sure.
The two hunks have arrived.
Hi.
So glad to have you here, Dad.
Happy to be here, tiger.
- How was your flight?
- Oh, good, good, you know, - I did "The Times" crossword.
- Oh, great puzzle to do, right?
- Oh, my God, 17 down?
- Oh, I know, - what about 16 across?
- What about 34 across?
Oh, what about 45 down?
Both: What about 20 across?
- I also did it.
- Yeah.
So Jake and I had a great conversation on the way here.
You didn't tell me he was so interested in mutual funds.
Uh Yeah, ugh, Amy is so bored of hearing me talk about allocation, asset mix, attribution analysis.
These are just terms I throw around all the time.
In alphabetical order.
Well, that's just how my brain works.
I mean, how would you list financial terms, in random order?
What are you, crazy?
He's got a point.
I like this guy.
Yeah.
Oh!
Captain Holt.
This is my dad.
Captain, heard a lot about you.
And I you.
Do you mind passing me those crab puffs?
Oh, certainly.
There you go.
Thank you.
Yeah.
That was everything.
Yeah, pretty big night: the three most important men in your life under one roof.
Well, Will Shorts isn't here.
Oh.
Burn on Holt probably.
That's the one you were talking about.
The Cairn Terrier is intelligent and inquisitive with a bold personality.
"A bold personality".
We know what that's code for: you're the bitch.
Pimento is back.
How's the dog show going?
Well, it's not without its drama.
Whoever groomed the Irish Setter might want to think about blowing his brains out.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how's that Wire Fox Terrier?
- Still in the lead?
- In the lead?
- I doubt she even wins her group.
- What?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't say that!
What?
She's not gonna win?
Ooh, I bet the check you gave me on the Wire Fox Terrier to win.
Why would you do that?
That money was to help you get a PI license.
Yeah, but I wanted to pay you back fast.
You made it sound like the terrier was a sure thing.
You said she was majestic.
They're all majestic.
This is a nationally-televised dog show.
This is the big time.
Listen, mister, I didn't give you that money so you could throw it away.
I want it back.
We're gonna pay your bookie a visit.
- What?
- And so help me God, you better hope I don't miss the "in memoriam".
If it's dead dogs you wanna see, I know where to get my hands on dozens of them.
All right, choo-choo!
Here comes the veggie train, leaving the station.
Next stop, a healthy body.
Terry has kids.
Just carrots for me.
I don't eat celery, hate the stuff.
Oh, that's funny.
Me too.
Really?
Get out of town.
Even though everybody says both: They're basically the same thing.
I'm gonna go get a refill.
Do you want something?
Oh, uh, you know, if they have it, maybe, like, a dry Riesling?
- Excellent choice.
- Thank you.
They definitely have it.
I brought it.
Wow, you are really pulling this off.
I know, all this research is actually gonna work.
Should I prepare for things all the time?
- Yeah.
- Nah, that's crazy.
Look, I can't believe you memorized that whole, huge binder.
Oh, I didn't.
I brought it with me and hid it out on the stoop.
So do you have a favorite watchmaker?
I do, but I actually have to run to the bathroom real quick.
Watches Gotcha.
I guess if I had to pick one watch, it would be NOMOS Glashutte.
It's a German company based in Saxony.
Speaking of which, I think I just dropped a bit of a Glashutte in the baÃ±o.
Steer clear.
The only downside is, I've told him I have to pee so much he thinks I have a UTI.
I wonder if he's ever had a UTI.
You know what, I'm gonna sneak outside and get the 411 on the UTI.
BRB.
He loves abbreviations.
Hey, Jake.
You looking for this?
What?
Oh, no.
Boyle, your turkey's here.
All right, let's do this.
Pretty cool, huh?
I feel like Dexter.
I think.
I never actually saw the show.
Billboard gave me nightmares.
Charles, are you crazy?
No, I don't want to watch a living animal die and then consume its flesh.
How is this different than eating a turkey that's been killed in a factory?
Because I don't have to see that.
It's called living in denial, you moron.
Gina, I know it seems cruel, but it's a swift death.
One painless chop removes the head.
I mean, that doesn't sound so bad.
And then its decapitated corpse only flops around for, like, half an hour.
You know what?
You won't be able to go through with this if I give this little guy a name.
He's now Nikolaj.
That's my son's name.
Go ahead, cut Nikolaj's throat.
Sorry, Gina, but we need a turkey, and you're the only one complaining.
I don't like it either.
It's not a fair fight.
Give the bird a gun, then see what happens.
Sarge, this must bother you too.
Yeah, but eating a big drumstick on Thanksgiving makes Terry feel like a king.
Sorry, but it's five against two.
Wait, you assume Hitchcock and I want to eat that turkey?
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
Charles, do what you need to do.
Copy that.
Uh-uh, no, hold up.
- Rosa, get the bird.
- On it.
I'll stand here and sacrifice my life to Charles's bloodlust.
I'm not gonna kill you, Gina.
Huh, then you already lost.
No, where are you going?
Hey, you can run, but you can't hide.
The apartment will run red with the blood of Nikolaj.
Please stop calling him that.
So, uh, what are you doing out here?
Sneaking a cigarette.
I just can't quit.
But you knew that, didn't you?
Page 136.
What is that strange book you're holding?
I've never seen it before.
"Jake Peralta's Guide to Tricking Amy's Dad".
What?
Who put that there?
Why did I use a title page?
Relax, Jake, it's okay.
Actually, I'm quite impressed.
- You are?
- Yeah, you did a ton of research here.
You made a binder.
This is real Santiago stuff.
Yeah, I-I guess it is.
I even used tabs.
- The good ones.
- Yes.
There are good and bad types of tabs.
- That's something we all know.
- I can't believe you did all this.
You've got my family tree, all of my case files, lot of photos.
Yes, and might I add, your ponytail in the 90s puts Amy's to shame.
They used to call me "The Lion".
Wow, cool nickname.
They call me "The Barracuda".
Well, I call me that.
I'm hoping it catches on.
I was wondering what you thought about one of my cases First Essex Bank Heist.
Yes, I read that one.
They got robbed the day before their grand opening.
I never solved that one.
That bothered me for 20 years.
But I see that you wrote a note here that says, "Contractor did it, so obvious".
Oh, what?
Well, you know us millennials, we're always exaggerating.
But what I think happened there is, is that I was reading that file, and I noticed that the contractor, Russo, was the, um - Obvious?
- Obvious suspect, but only in the sense that he was the only one who could've possibly done it 'cause he had the blueprint.
I talked to Russo.
He had an alibi.
Of course, of course.
But, you know, the name of the company was "Russo and Sons," so I figure probably, maybe, definitely the sons did it.
Maybe.
Probably.
For sure.
Sons?
Oh, my God, the sons.
I think you might be on to something.
- Really?
- I don't know how I missed that.
I bet they still live here in New York.
We should go talk to them right now.
I mean, if that would be okay.
"Okay," are you kidding me?
I would love to work a case with you.
That's amazing.
Looks like The Lion is gonna roar again.
And the Barracuda is gonna What?
Anyway, you get it, let's go.
Your bookie lives in a college dorm?
He's a freshman.
They don't let them live off-campus first year.
Doi.
Hey, Adrian, come on in.
Happy Thanksgiving, man.
Can it, Alan.
Listen, I need the money back, and I need it back now.
Aw, geez, I'm sorry.
I can't do that.
I placed the bet online.
It's not like I can cancel it.
You just placed the bet online?
Yeah.
He could've done it himself.
It's really easy.
I kept telling him there's no need for bookies anymore.
No, no, no, I don't mess with computers, okay?
Ever since I died of dysentery on the Oregon Trail, I was like, no thank you.
I'm done with this.
Okay, look, the money's already in the Caribbean.
There's nothing I can do.
Looks like we're going to the Caribbean.
You do know we're not going to the Caribbean, right?
I didn't know that.
That is a bummer.
Come on, guys.
It's getting late.
Open the door.
Not until you promise to let this little turkey live out the rest of his life with Rosa.
What?
Why can't it live with you?
I'm an ideas man.
All right, that's it.
You've left me no choice.
There we go.
Thanks.
Now give us the bird.
Gladly.
Whoop, whoop Not that bird.
Don't take another step.
This ends now.
I am so sorry, girl.
Great party, but uh-uh.
All right, here it is.
Be free, noble bird.
Be free, fly away.
Fly to freedom.
Gina, turkeys can't fly.
-  -  Why is he looking at me like that?
Nobody make any sudden moves.
Yeah, and those talons are super sharp, huh?
That thing's a freaking dinosaur.
So, where were you the day the bank was robbed?
I don't understand, Dad.
What's going on?
- Well, honey, this man - The Barracuda.
Wants to talk to me about something that happened 20 years ago, and as I said to that man The Lion.
20 years ago, I was in Pittsburgh at a softball tournament.
Oh, Pittsburgh, interesting.
Home of the Bengals.
Home of the Steelers.
No, this is the home of the stealers.
I set you up perfectly for that.
While you were busy establishing an alibi, your sons were back in Brooklyn robbing the bank.
But we were at the softball tournament too.
Oh, convenient you say that now when you have no proof.
Didn't you guys bring back a trophy?
A trophy's not really proof.
We also have a framed photograph of the team, a videotape of the whole event, 39 eye-witnesses, a newspaper article about it, and security footage from the gas stations we stopped at on the way to and from Pittsburgh.
Okay, I gotta say, it seems a little weird you're so prepared for these questions.
No, it's not.
My brother and I had to gather all that information 20 years ago when we got accused of the exact same stuff by him.
Say what now?
Captain, you seem upset.
Are you mad at me about something?
Yes, obviously.
I gave you $2,000, and you threw it away.
Ugh, I knew that was it.
Stupid, Adrian, stupid!
- And it's not just the money.
- I know you believed in me.
And I took that belief, and I just dumped all over it.
Wait, Adrian, an SMS text alert.
Just pulled my pants down and squatted all Adrian, be quiet.
The beagle's been eliminated.
Our dog is in the top three!
Put the dog show on, at once.
The game's on.
Put on the dog show, Hank!
It's in overtime.
So what was that?
You set me up?
You already knew they had an alibi.
Of course I did.
I guess I guess you must have missed that fact when you were putting together your sloppy, lazy, garbage binder.
What?
I thought you loved my binder.
You said I used all the good tabs.
Those tabs weren't even cascading.
Okay.
Oh, I see.
I think I know what's happening here.
You're upset because Amy and I have seen each other's butts.
- What?
- Oh, God, it wasn't that.
Please forget I said anything about your daughter's butt.
You know why I don't like you, Jake?
'Cause of my binder, apparently.
No.
Because of my binder.
What, you think I wouldn't do my own research, find out everything I could about whoever my daughter is dating?
Okay, fine, but it's not like you found anything bad about me.
I mean, look at this credit score: 100.
- Out of 850.
- Oh, no, really?
This binder tells the story of a sloppy, disorganized, irresponsible individual who's not allowed within 500 feet of Taylor Swift.
That was a misunderstanding.
You're not good enough for my Amy.
I don't want my only daughter dating a screw-up.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I don't want my only girlfriend daughtering a jerk-dad.
Burn on you.
-  - It's Amy.
Can I answer it?
Am I good enough to have a conversation with her?
Honestly, no.
Well, I don't care.
I'm doing it anyway.
Hello, lover.
How's that butt?
What?
Are you with my dad?
I sure am, and you're on speaker phone.
So feel free to tell me all about your sexuality and the intercourse we might have together, getting it in.
I was just calling to tell you there's a turkey loose in the apartment, but somehow that's not the weirdest part of this phone call.
What's going on?
Oh, nothing.
Just had a real eye-opening conversation with your dad.
I wanted his approval, but he says I'll never be good enough for you.
- What the hell?
- I know, right?
- Tell him he's wrong.
- No, I'm upset with you.
That's right, go get 'em, tiger.
I'm also upset with you.
What is this, 1950?
I can't date someone unless I have my father's approval?
- Oh, obviously you can - You guys act like this is your decision to make, like, the woman doesn't even exist in this equation.
Well, this woman - Wait, Amy, shut up.
- Excuse me?
I mean, I'm so sorry, you were making a totally valid point about gender equality, but I just thought of something really important so I'm gonna hang up on you, okay?
Love you, bye.
It wasn't Russo or his sons.
Both: It was the daughter!
All right, someone's gotta go out there and kill that feathery bastard.
Rosa, you're always looking for an excuse to behead something.
Don't look at me.
Terry wastes all that time building muscles, - make him do it.
- Oh, come on, you all know these are just for show.
Gina's the one who set him free.
How was I supposed to know there'd be consequences - for my actions?
- Enough.
I started this.
I'm gonna end it.
It's turkey time.
This is it, the final lap.
Bichon Frise dismissed.
We're the top two, just us and that stupid freaking schnauzer.
Come on, Wire Fox Terrier.
Come on, baby.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
The judge has made his decision.
Shut up!
Hold my hand, Captain.
Hold my hand.
And Best in Show goes to the Wire Fox Terrier.
- I'm gonna live forever!
- Whoo!
Charles?
It's been quiet for a while.
Everything okay?
I was gonna chop the heck out of this bastard, but then he looked me in the eye, and I realized that nature is beautiful.
He scratched you up real bad, didn't he?
Yep, he got me good.
It's okay.
Once I started giving him gouda, he showed me mercy.
So we're not eating the turkey then?
Obviously not.
Hello, everyone.
Guess who just solved a 20-year-old unsolvable case?
Wait, what?
You guys figured out who pulled the First Essex Bank job?
Yep.
We realized we never checked the daughter's alibi.
She wasn't at the softball trip, she had access to the plans, and then she just confessed.
That's right.
We arrested a woman today because we are feminists.
So, does this mean you like each other now?
- Yep.
- Jury's still out.
- Uh-oh.
- Doesn't matter.
It only matters what Amy thinks, and apparently she loves you.
I do.
That's the first time we've ever kissed.
- Yeah!
-  - The Wire Fox boys are back!
- Whoo!
Yeah!
I just won 70 grand, So, Rosa, pack your bags, we're going to Tampa.
â Tight.
Can't wait.
â Guys, I'm out of gouda.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 I can't believe they're waxing the floors and we're all stuck in here.
I've never seen them do this before.
They do it once a month.
We've just never been on the night shift.
I know.
It's like we're being punished.
We are, for going to Florida.
Oh.
I don't listen to so much stuff you all say.
Well, frankly, I pity the lot of you.
You look out there and see a problem.
I look out there and see an opportunity.
I'm gonna slide on that slippery floor all the way from Holt's office to the elevator.
You're going to do the FBP?
That's right, Rosa.
I'm doing The Full Bullpen!
Here we go.
And we can build this dream together Standing strong forever  Nothing's gonna stop us now And if this world runs out of lovers We'll still have each other Nothing's gonna stop us  Nothing's gonna stop us now No!
Oh, no!
I can't stop!
The Full Bullpen!
Those chuckleheads from the Nine-Five are getting all cocky just 'cause they're on TV.
Uh, we've all been on the local news, fellas.
Okay.
Which case of yours was on the news?
Well, it wasn't exactly a case.
Ska defines who I am as a person, and I will never turn my back on ska.
Hup!
Looking back, I have no regrets.
- You should.
- Yup.
So why are the Nine-Five on the news?
They're investigating death threats against some author named DC Parlov, as if anyone knows who the hell that is.
DC Parlov?
Did you say DC Parlov?
- What is happening?
- DC Parlov is the most influential author of our time.
"The Skyfire Cycle"!
12 books chronicling the war between sky and sand, clouds and rocks, the Sepsidians and Oh, so it's like a "Game of Thrones" type thing?
No, "Game of Thrones" is a "Skyfire" type thing!
Get your head out of your ass!
- Yeah, come on, Boyle.
- I'm so sorry, guys.
When I was a little kid, I spent hours reading those books.
Whoa.
Little Terry did not see that coming.
I was overweight and lonely, and I wrote DC Parlov for advice, and he sent me this!
I hope it's not a severed head.
"The Skyfire Cycle: Sand Into Glass: The Reckoning of Ka'Lar".
Man, that is a long book.
Is the rest of it just more of the title?
It's the book that started it all.
And listen to the inscription he wrote.
"Terry, you do have friends.
Oh, boy.
"You have me.
Never forget that in this life, we write our own stories.
Parlov".
And that's what happened.
Little Terry wrote his own story.
Yeah, Little Terry got buff-a!
Little Terry got emotionally healthy.
Yeah, and ja-a-acked.
You know what?
He did get jacked.
Way to go, Little Terry.
Big pecs coming through!
-  - Ah.
There we go.
I'm going to get us that case.
Terry's gonna meet his hero.
Oh, no, never meet your heroes.
Marie Callender was a real bitch.
Oh, check it out.
Our squad has doubled the number of arrests on the night shift.
Yeah, no one cares, okay?
I need to talk top you about this Boyle family vacation that my mom's forcing me to go on.
Why is it in Butt Thumb, Iowa?
No, it's pronounced "Beaut-Hume," And Iowa is the ancestral homeland of the Boyle clan.
I am so excited for you to get to know all of the cousins.
Watch out for Sherman.
He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.
Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?
There's a great one in Aruba.
Aruba?
Boyles don't do beaches.
We're not swimmers.
We're burrowers.
Yes, I know, you're all earthworms, but, Charles, even nature's most disgusting creatures deserve pleasure.
Come to Aruba.
Sorry, the cousins voted and it was unanimous.
We're going to Iowa.
We've already rented the tent.
"Tent" singular?
Charles, "tent" singular?
Diaz, Santiago, settle a little tiff that Kevin and I are having.
Let's be honest, Raymond, it's not a tiff, it's a row.
And now it's a scene.
It's okay, sir, we don't want to get involved in your personal life.
It's not personal.
It's a math problem.
- Oh, Mama.
- Pass.
Raymond and I had dinner together last night for the first time in two weeks, thanks to the night shift.
And Kevin thought it would be fun to spoil our date with an inane math problem, to which his answer is wrong.
Enough foreplay, let's get to the numbers.
It's the "Monty Hall problem".
Imagine you're on a game show.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You're telling it wrong.
There are three doors, behind one of which is a car.
You pick a door.
The host, who knows where the car is, opens a different door, showing you there's nothing behind it.
Now the host asks if you'd like to choose the other unopened door.
Should you do it?
- No.
- Yes.
Both: It's simple math.
It doesn't make any sense to switch.
The prize is behind one of two doors.
It's a 50/50 chance either way.
It's 2/3 if you switch, 1/3 if you don't.
The probability locks in when you make the choice.
We've been over this eight times.
Seven times.
Now you can't even do simple addition.
- Kevin is right.
- Hmm.
You're fired.
- What?
- Ah!
Hey, Sarge, great news.
The guys at the Nine-Five gave us the DC Parlov case.
No big deal, you don't have to thank me.
- Give it back.
- You're welcome.
- Wait, what?
- This is a bad idea, Jake.
I don't want to meet him.
Oh, I see.
You're nervous to meet your hero.
Look, I get it.
One time I saw Patrick Ewing at a deli, and I was so scared I almost left, but I stayed.
I worked up my courage, I walked over to him and I introduced myself, and you know what he said to me?
"Hey".
- That's it?
- It's Patrick Ewing, he's busy!
Give him the benefit of the doubt, Sarge.
Come on, you're braver than this.
Just tell him how meaningful the note he wrote you was.
People love knowing that they changed someone's life.
I mean, why do you think I'm doing this for you?
This isn't about me.
No.
That was 30 years ago.
He won't remember, and I'll feel silly.
Well, we're about to find out.
Parlov just walked in.
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!
All right, just breathe.
Stop fanning your armpits like that.
Oh, good Lord!
Keep fanning them!
- Keep fanning them!
- Oh.
Mr. Parlov.
Welcome to the Nine-Nine.
Well, thank you very much.
I'm a little curious about why my case got reassigned.
Is there some problem?
Quite the opposite.
The top brass just wanted New York's best detective on it.
Allow me to introduce Mister Sergeant Terry Jeffords.
Sarge?
Hi.
Uh-oh.
Terry, you want to come out here and help me take Mr. Parlov's statement?
He usually stands much taller than that.
Anyway, tell us about these death threats you've been getting.
Any idea who might be sending them?
Well, I'm pretty sure that it had to be a fan.
I've had a little bit of a backlash from some of my younger male readers ever since I revealed the fact that Qwandor the dragon is actually a female.
I would think teen boys would love a lady dragon, Did you give her big, scaly boobs, or I don't know, you're the writer.
Qwandor is not a sexual being.
For she is the ender of bloodlines.
All mortals tremble before her wrath.
- "Skyfire" fan?
- Oh, I'm more than a fan.
Whoever wrote this has got nothing on me.
Uh, he's not a killer.
Tell him about the inscription.
You probably don't remember, but 30 years ago, I wrote you a letter telling you how lonely and sad I was, and you sent me a book with the inscription, "We all write our own stories," and it changed my life.
- I do remember you.
- You do?
I do indeed, and I'm delighted you made something of yourself.
As the Cloud Rock says both: "You found yourself in your struggle".
Wow.
Both: "The truth is what you came for, and you found it within your strife".
Well, that was cool.
- Both: "Be brave for Tolgan".
- There's more.
Both: "Tolgan the last, Tolgan the first, Tolgan".
"Tolgan".
Is it over?
Yes.
This is the best day of my life.
You have three kids, Terry.
I said what I said!
All right.
- Cousin Sam!
- Chucky!
Up high.
Down low.
Both: Butts!
Butts!
Butts!
Oh, man, I love this shirt.
Where'd you get that?
Oh.
Both: Mervyn's.
Oh.
Gina, get your rear over here.
Sam, you've gotta meet Gina.
Oh, already did.
She took me out for dinner.
Yeah, I just wanted to get to know Sam better, and talk about the upcoming vacation.
I got him his favorite egg salad on white, bowl of cottage cheese both: Hard boiled egg on the side.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Turns out Sam here also thinks we should go to Aruba.
N I know it sounds crazy, but the Caribbean might be more fun than Iowa.
In what universe?
I'd tell you to pack sunscreen, but Mm, looks like you already got burned.
Uh-oh, did I?
'Cause my skin still tastes pretty raw.
- Ew.
- Sorry, vote's in.
13-2, Iowa.
For now, but I have a whole day of Boyle cousins scheduled, starting with Bobby Boyle at 3:00 for afternoon eggs.
You think you can pick us off one-by-one?
- Yeah.
- Well, you can.
Boyles are very weak as individuals.
But, together, we're unbreakable.
I'm calling a council of the cousins!
I'm scared!
Just kidding.
Come on, Sam.
Sam, stay.
- Sam, come.
- Sam, stay.
Come on, Sam.
- Sam, stay.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Stay.
- Come.
-  Stay.
All right, let's get on this case.
I can't let my hero die.
Great.
Parlov is in town for a reading of his new book, "The Skyfire Cycle: A Bridge to Jarcata".
Ah, ah.
It's actually pronounced "Jarca-a".
All the T's in "Skyfire" are silent.
This book sounds impossible to read.
I know, right?
Okay.
All the death threats were sent from New York, so the perp is local.
They'll probably try and strike at the book reading tomorrow night.
And he's probably camped out on the street with the other fan boys.
They've been lined up for three days.
To listen to an old man read a story?
I will never understand this world.
You once took a train to Toronto to get a Canadian VHS copy of "Die Hard".
There was a rumor it was better sound quality.
Get a grip, Terry.
We just need a way to compare the fans' handwriting to the death threats.
Oh!
We get them to sign a petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male.
Ooh, "smorf".
But are we going to fit in there dressed like this?
No.
No, we're not.
Yeah So I'm outside of da club And you think I'm a punk Sign our petition to make Qwandor the dragon a male!
There are already enough girl characters.
We don't need a third!
Good evening, sir.
No, it's not.
I haven't slept, because I've been going over that stupid problem.
Now I finally understand Kevin's side.
Cool, so it's all better and I never have to hear about math again?
Quite the opposite.
I know better than ever how incorrect he is.
Probability doesn't kick in.
Do I have to teach you college level statistics?
I don't know, do I have to teach you high school statistics?
Do I have to teach you eighth grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you seventh grade statistics?
Do I have to teach you Now, if you'll excuse me, detectives, I need to leave him a snide voicemail about kindergarten statistics.
Okay, we have got to explain this thing to Captain Holt to save their relationship.
And you laughed at me when I went to that weekend-long math conference.
'Cause you called it "funky cats and their feisty stats".
That was the name!
It was so cool.
It was not.
Anyway, it's not about the math.
They haven't seen each other because of the night shift.
They just need to bone.
What?
Gross!
Rosa, those are our dads!
I mean That's not what I think.
- Captain Dad is just my boss.
- Wow.
Never mind, I'm teaching father the math!
Whatever, Rosa.
To be honest, Terry, I'm feeling a little lame out here.
I mean, you got this cool sword, and I'm wearing what, a potato sack?
You're my noble squire.
You should be thankful for that burlap, it's hiding your terrible failed castration.
Oh, my God, I hate these books.
Are you the guys passing out the Qwandor petition?
Yup, that's us.
Dragons have dongs.
You bet they do.
And this isn't about sexism.
I mean, it's just that women aren't strong enough to be dragons.
Now, handeth me yon "petish".
Okay.
"Petish" handeth yon'd.
This is a start, but if you really want Parlov to hear you, you're gonna have to send a message in blood.
I think we've got a suspect.
Let's ride.
Whoa, that's very heavy.
Halitosis Frodo's got to be our guy, right?
Oh, yeah.
"A message in blood" is a reference to book one.
Page 843.
After Wendivil betrayed Prince Clevang, murdered him, and used his blood to write letters to his children.
Do you talk about this stuff with Sharon?
No.
She hates it.
Yeah, makes sense.
Uh, This writing doesn't match up.
I'm gonna send it to the lab anyway.
Yeah, I don't think that's necessary.
Why not?
Because I just found a perfect match.
Parlov wrote the death threats.
He sent them to himself.
Terry did not see that coming.
And that is a perfect match.
This is crazy.
Why would Parlov send himself a death threat?
For publicity?
I mean, he was on TV.
His book is on the best-seller list for the first time in years.
Parlov doesn't need any help.
He's already famous, rich.
He's got more babes than he can handle.
Come on, that guy?
Now you're just lying to prove a point.
He pulls, Jake.
He pulls.
Ugh.
Look, I know how it is.
It can be disappointing to meet your hero.
I mean, just like me and Patrick Ewing.
- You said that went great.
- I lied.
It was a disaster.
Excuse me, Mr. Ewing, my name is Jake Per - Oh, no!
- Wha - Hey!
- You're my favorite player.
You pantsing Patrick Ewing has nothing to do with this.
It doesn't?
Oh, my God, why did I share that story?
There is no way Parlov sent himself that death threat.
Look, we are gonna go to his hotel, we're gonna talk to him, and he'll have an explanation.
- Whatever you need.
- Screw you, Peralta!
I'm sorry, I thought you were gonna disagree.
Thank you for your support.
It really means a lot to me.
Is everything okay, Santiago?
- No, I lost my ring.
- Did you see where it went?
Actually it's behind one of these three doors.
Why don't you pick one?
Are you trying to Monty Hall me?
It's unbelievable.
I don't need Monty Hall ruining my place of work when Monty Hall has already ruined my home life.
Come on, sir, the math thing isn't the problem.
Night shift's keeping you and Kevin apart.
- You two just need to bone.
-  - What did you say?
- Don't say it again.
- I said you two need to bone.
-  How dare you, Detective Diaz.
I am your superior officer!
Bone!
What happens in my bedroom, Detective, is none of your business.
Bone?
!
Don't ever speak to me like that again.
Why did you do that?
Dude was pent up.
Now he knows.
Problem solved.
The council of the cousins.
Look at them.
It's like a Beige of Pigs.
Gina, you seem rattled.
You don't normally make puns.
That's a pun?
On what?
Listen, Charles, I'm gonna sway the council.
So give up now unless you enjoy being humiliated - in front of your family.
- Oh, you think I'd be embarrassed in front of them?
In front of Don Boyle?
I changed his diapers.
- And I'm about to change yours.
- Ugh.
Hello, cousins.
Bobby, Brendan, Bill, Bernard, boy Corey, girl Corey.
Papa Boyle once said: "Stay in the middle.
"That's where it's safe.
"That's where we thrive.
That's Iowa".
Charles will tell you believe that Aruba isn't for the Boyles, but picture this: one long banana boat with the 15 of us on it, holding each other by the waist, having the time of our damn lives.
Do we really wanna go where "Pirates of the Caribbean" - took place?
- Yes!
-  - No!
That movie gave us nightmares for months!
Y'all know I got y'all aqua socks!
Oh!
Size 7s for everybody.
In conclusion, Boyles are nothing if not loyal.
Loyal to our favorite brand of peanut butter, Mr. Nuts.
Loyal to each other and loyal to Iowa.
I love you.
All: I love you.
I'm Gina Linetti, and I approve this message.
I love you.
All: I love you.
- I love you too.
- You guys both did so good.
I think we'll sleep on it and we'll vote in the morning.
Council adjourned.
I love you.
All: I love you.
Hey.
What's up guys?
Look, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy right now.
I've some female companions over, you know.
Oh, really?
What are they, like, some nerdy sci-fi fans, or Good Lord!
I don't know what I'm looking at.
I told you, man, he pulls.
He Pu-u-ulls.
Okay, stop saying "pulls".
Mr. Parlov, we have to talk to you.
Now, we're not accusing you of anything.
We just want to ask a few questions.
You know, we're probably wrong.
- We should just go.
- Sarge, no.
God, you're strong!
Mr. Parlov, did you send yourself those death threats for publicity?
Are you kidding me?
I have no need for publicity.
The handwriting in the death threats matches perfectly with the inscription you wrote to Terry.
Yeah, tell you the truth, I didn't actually write this inscription myself.
Both: What?
Come on, you guys, grow up.
You think I have time to answer each letter I get from every sad little fat kid that writes me?
Come on.
That's why I've got assistants, precisely for that sort of crap.
But you said you remembered me.
Because you were the cop assigned to my case.
Look, I didn't want to piss you off.
The man you're looking for, he's my ex-assistant.
His name is Edmund Grail.
The guy hates me.
I slept with his wife, so naturally, I had to fire him.
Yeah, that's a cool story.
After that, I got sort of involved with his sister.
- It was kind of hot - Please stop talking.
Fine.
I have a little bit of research to attend to myself, if you understand what I'm talking about.
Enjoy having sex with three gorgeous women in cosplay.
Well, that went terribly.
I'm so sorry.
Do you need a moment alone or you want to talk about it or  Yep yep.
That works, too.
Hey, good news.
I found the address of Parlov's old assistant.
I'm gonna go over there and question him.
You want to come?
Maybe he won't open the door and you'll have to kick it down.
That always cheers you up.
I don't feel like kicking down doors.
What about running really fast through a wall, leaving a perfect outline of your body?
Like a cartoon?
- Mm-hmm.
- No.
I'm just gonna sit here and think about how the words I lived by my entire life are a big fat lie.
Look, Sarge, I understand what it's like to have a hero who doesn't act the way you want him to.
It's not gonna be about Patrick Ewing again, is it?
No, and it's not about John Starks, either, who I also pantsed.
How many Knicks have you pantsed?
Including coaches, five, but that's not the point.
The hero I was talking about is you.
You're a great cop and dad and husband and boss.
And also, you always smell just a little bit like vanilla.
That's my soap.
I got it at Lush.
You're who I want to be when I grow up, Terry.
And you should know that some dumb inscription in some stupid book isn't what made you who you are.
And it bums me out that you can't see that.
Now, I'm gonna go get this bad guy, because that's what you taught me to do.
Also what was the name of the soap store again?
Forget it.
I'll just look it up online.
Okay, we're both here, Sam.
Go ahead.
Well, it was a real hard decision, but ultimately we decided the Boyles are going to Aruba!
All right, Sam, well, I'm happy to hear that.
I think the sun's gonna be really good for everyone's psoriasis.
We're all so excited.
All right, I love you, Charles.
I love you, Gina.
Whoops.
Lost you.
It was almost too easy.
I'm like the Temple Grandin of herding Boyles.
Yes, you are.
What?
Why are you smiling?
I don't get it.
I won.
Did you?
You were so busy trying to beat the Boyles, you became one.
You learned about our likes and dislikes, our allergies and our phobias.
You even bought cousin Sherman a scrunchy for his ponytail.
Yeah, so I could win.
And you did win a plot in the family cemetery.
All of us together lying in a grave for eternity!
"Grave" singular?
Charles, "grave" singular?
Oh, Captain, I know you don't want to talk about Monty Hall, but I did contact a math No need, Santiago.
It's all good.
So the fight with Kevin is over?
Yep.
Because you understand the math now?
Nope.
- Because you guys - Yep.
Knew it.
See, what happened is, your dads had sex.
Okay, Rosa.
Edmund Grail?
Who wants to know?
NYPD.
I need to ask you a few questions about DC Parlov.
Oh, okay.
Let me just undo the chain.
Son of a bitch.
Freeze!
Taste the might of Ka'Lar!
Get him out of here.
Nice work, Sarge.
You were right.
Who cares about Parlov?
We write our own stories.
So welcome to the Terry Chronicles.
Book One: The Arrest of Edmund Grail.
Followed by Book Two: The Ravishing of Sharon.
I am so sorry.
I'm just pumped that you showed up.
I couldn't let you down.
And that is why you are my hero.
Come on.
Bring it in, big fella.
Oop  Oh, no!
It happened again!
It happened again, Terry!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 Hey there, Boyle.
How was your weekend?
Well, actually I got a little sick.
Oh, really?
I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Yeah, "Bullets over Broadway" was on TV.
And I came down with a big ol' Dianne Wiest infection.
Like "yeast".
So I'll coordinate with the transit cops while you follow up with the DA's off Uh, can I help you, - Captain Stentley?
- Oh, hey, uh, did you guys see a black backpack sitting around anywhere?
- I did not.
- No.
Aww, shoot, this is turning out to be a real cluster-biff.
Why?
What's in the backpack?
Uh, just some evidence.
Do you guys know - a drug dealer named Flaco?
- Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn.
Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine I'm not good with sizes and a cell phone.
And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.
I do now.
That's a great theory!
Whoa.
But the bag is missing, so Hey, how big of a deal is it if I, um, if I never find it?
- I'd say it's a very - Ah-uh-uh-uh.
- Sugarcoat it for me.
- Okay, um, no biggie.
Ahh, that is great news.
Thank you so much.
Hey, if you see something, say something.
Oh, that is catchy, huh?
It's like, I just - made up a hit song.
- Nope, very common - police expression.
- If you see somethin' Say somethin', come on and party tonight -  -  This is our chance.
If C.J. can't find that evidence, he could be fired.
This could be our way back onto the day shift.
Come on and party tonight Wow!
It's actually - a really catchy song.
- There's nothing to celebrate.
Captain Stentley is going to find that evidence - because we're gonna help him.
- What?
No, this is our chance to undermine him.
Come on and party tonight.
Peralta, we're police officers.
We have a duty to protect this city.
We took an oath, a sacred oath.
What if those drugs end up on the street or a dangerous criminal is set free - because of missing evidence?
-  Okay, you know, you're trying to say it's whatever because you just .
- You're fumfering.
- Of course I'm fumfering.
Fine, we'll find the bag.
Come on and party tonight.
Damn it.
Hey, guys, department has a new green initiative.
We have to reduce energy usage by 15%.
That means no more laminating, Santiago.
Oh, that's fine.
It's not the thing that gives me the most pleasure in life.
Interacting with other people, that's what gets me going.
Scully, Hitchcock, lose the chocolate fountain.
What are we supposed to dip our strawberries in?
Our nacho cheese fountain?
That's crazy.
Unless - Sarge, you beautiful bastard.
- Get rid of 'em.
And, Gina, you can't run that space heater 24/7 anymore.
Space heater?
Excuse me, this is a Fornax Radiant Comfort System, and her name is Jacinta.
Okay, well, Jacinta's gotta go.
- He didn't mean that, darling.
- Seriously, turn off - the space heater.
- No.
- Do it, now.
That's an order.
- Yeah, well, you don't wanna start a battle of the wills with Gina Linetti because you will emerge from that battle a broken man.
Not to brag, but I was name-checked in my kindergarten teacher's suicide note.
Oh, my God.
Any luck finding the missing backpack?
No, but I did find C.J.'s wallet, badge, and gun on top of the toilet paper dispenser.
I'm assuming he doesn't know they're missing.
- Mm.
- Why are you helping this guy, sir?
He's the opposite of everything you stand for.
His favorite expression is "that's gonna leave a mark".
And he doesn't even use it right.
Whoo, that soup is good.
That's gonna leave a mark.
What?
Well, he's not our best, but I won't be part of any sneaky subterfuge designed to undermine him.
You think you're so great just 'cause you always do what's good and right.
Well, I've got news - for you: ya boring.
- You know who else was called "boring"?
Andreas Marggraf.
- And you know what he did?
- He discovered zinc, because you've used that one on me before because, uh, ya boring.
Well, if I'm so boring, how come I have a lead?
Come take a look at this.
This is security footage from the day the backpack went missing.
11:00 a.m., the bag's over a chair.
Now let's fast forward and see what happened to it.
Wait, that was two hours?
Where's C.J. during all this?
You have the right to remain silent - Come on and party tonight - Party tonight The guy's got good hooks.
I mean, right?
Wait, who's this guy?
Flaco must've sent someone to get the backpack, and they just waltzed right in and took it out of the precinct.
Oh, C.J. is in so much trouble.
You think that disapproving glare works on me after all the times I've seen it?
Step it up, find something new, ya boring.
'Ello, me lady.
It's your matey lil' Charlie Boyle, innit, love?
Ugh, it's 2:00 a.m., and we're working.
How can you be so happy?
Because I figured out the secret of surviving the night shift.
You see, this little piggy went to the warehouse.
This little piggy went with him.
This little piggy was like Stop, just stop and say whatever - you are saying another way.
- I found a 24 hour foot massage parlor, and it's amazing.
It's the best experience you've ever had.
You're just like, mmm  Ahh, wha?
Wouldn't stop making that noise, man.
Let me take you, let me show you the greatest and only pleasure of the night shift.
Pass, I'd rather die than have a stranger touch my bare feet.
I'm telling you, once they get get their strong fingers in your toe gaps, it's just mmm   Uh, that's on me, shouldn't have had my eyes closed.
-  - Hey, C.J., you upset about something, man?
Maybe something in your career?
Yeah, I told the brass that I lost the bag and I screwed up the whole Flaco case, and you were wrong, it was a biggie.
Yeah, well, you told me to sugarcoat it.
- And whose fault it that, Jake?
- Yours.
- I know.
- Okay, so what happened?
I mean, they couldn't have fired you, right?
That'd be crazy.
I mean, they could, for sure, they had every reason to, but did they?
- Did they fire you?
- Worse.
- They're pulling my transfer.
- What transfer, what now?
Oh, I've just been feeling overwhelmed with this job, and I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm a little in over my head.
- Completely unqualified, yeah.
- It is so cool that you get me.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I heard that they were hiring a head administrator at the Police Academy, - so I put in for it.
- Wait, you wanna - train other officers?
- Well, the nine years at the academy were some of the best years of my life.
- That's a six-month program.
- Sure, for a lot of people.
Anyway, they said that the job was mine, and now they're pissed, so it looks like I'm stuck here forever.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
All is not lost.
We can still fix this.
So, sure, maybe you can't get back the backpack, but you could do something even better.
Like, what if you single-handedly figure out who Flaco is and then you take him down.
Oh, come on, Jake.
I'll just screw it up like I screw up everything else.
No, you won't, because I will be there to help you, but don't worry, you'll still get all the credit.
Listen to me, C.J., we're gonna get you the hell out of here.
Are you sugarcoating this for me?
I most certainly am not.
Whoo, that's gonna leave a mark.
Ahh.
So, Captain, I've been thinking about this whole missing backpack thing, and what if we find Flaco - and take him down?
- Oh, are you trying to solve C.J.'s case behind his back to embarrass him?
No, not at all.
In fact, I think C.J. should come along.
I just realized how important my duty as a police officer is to me, you know?
The sacred oath I took.
Your speech really inspired me.
Well, it was one of my better ones.
Felt really good as I was saying it.
- Yeah.
- So what's the plan, son?
Well, Dad, we don't know where Flaco is, but I have a C.I. who says he's got an agreement with Marco Severino.
So you think we should pose as drug dealers looking for a new heroin supplier and get Severino to hook us up with Flaco.
And you think - C.J. can handle this mission.
- I know he's inexperienced, but he's a creative guy.
I think he'd be great undercover.
Okay, muchachos, let's roll up on these muchachos.
Great start, and I love your double use of "muchachos".
Hey, it's C.J., by the way.
-  - Oooh, that's a nice lam job.
This one goes on the blog.
Hey, Sarge, what up, bro?
"What up, bro"?
You're laminating - in here, aren't you?
- I'm sorry.
I just love it so much.
It's okay, I'm used to it.
No one listens to me.
- I'm a lousy sergeant.
- What?
No, don't say that.
- Why would you say that?
- If I tell you something, you promise not to tell anyone else?
- Of course.
- You know how I took - the lieutenant's exam last week?
- Uh-huh.
I just found out I didn't pass.
Oh, no, but you shouldn't feel bad, only like 10% of people pass on the first try.
I know, and I'm all exhausted because of the night shift, plus my bathroom break during the test took a little longer than anticipated.
May I use the restroom, please?
Uh-oh, nothing to see here.
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Little desk.
That's why they say "it's test time, so diaper up".
They say that, I've never said that.
I've never worn a diaper during test.
Who would wear a diaper during a test?
That's ridiculous, I mean - Santiago.
- Sorry, look, don't give up on the green initiative.
You're a great sergeant.
- You'll get everyone on board.
- Not Gina.
Yes, Gina.
You can handle her.
You can do this.
Sarge, it's test time.
Diaper up.
Thank you for coming along with me on this manhunt.
- I needed your help.
- No problem, - who are we looking for?
- He's a one-armed smuggler from the dunes of Tunisia.
He goes by the name - of SeÃ±or Riff Raff.
- You're taking me - to that foot massage place.
- I am taking you to the foot massage place.
I made that whole thing up.
- Shocking.
- Look, the night shift hasn't been easy on any of us.
Let me make it slightly better by paying a strong-handed woman to literally milk the stress from your feet.
- Just shut up, I'll do it once.
-  - Yes!
- As long as you promise to never ever talk about foot milk again.
- Deal, you're gonna love it.
- I guarantee you, I won't.
Both: Mmm.
All right, that's Severino's restaurant.
- My C.I. says he's in there.
- Whoo, I'm pumped.
I'm ready.
Um, just out of curiosity, how how scared are you guys?
- Not at all.
How about you?
- I'm terrified, but, you know, I just keep telling myself, worst comes to worst, just start shooting things, you know?
I think it might be better if you stayed in the van.
Wait, are you trying to sideline me?
- Yes.
- Oh, thank God.
-  - But just because you're in the van doesn't mean you're not an important part of the mission.
Your job will be to keep an eye on the restaurant.
And, if anybody suspicious walks in, you just Run everybody over with the van and then back up if they're still moving.
Don't try and guess where I'm going with it.
You keep an eye on the door.
If anyone suspicious walks in, - let us know in our ear pieces.
- Oh, I could do that, absolutely.
You know, actually I saw those ear pieces on "Ellen".
One time, Justin Bieber was on, and he was supposed to be, like, a security guard, only C.J., I'm loving the story, but we gotta go in.
- I'll finish later.
- TBC.
Thanks for hand-laminating, Santiago.
Of course, if you ask me, saving energy is trending.
- Oh, Gina, didn't see you there.
- Gina, did you shut off - your space heater yet?
- Space heater - Doesn't ring any bells.
- Jacinta.
Oh, no, she's still going strong.
I will take that thing away from you by force, if necessary.
- Well, come and get it.
- Seriously?
- The heater's under your skirt?
- Maybe.
You can't prove that.
Yeah, I can.
There's a cord running under it, - and I think you may be on fire.
- Mm, so?
- What do you mean "so"?
- I'm not giving up Jacinta.
You are on fire, Gina.
You do not have the upper hand - in this situation.
- I always have the upper hand.
Not when there's flames shooting out of your butt!
Especially when there's flames shooting out of my butt.
Damn it.
How the hell did I lose that one?
- Hey, you Severino?
- Who wants to know?
I'm Cal, this is Billy.
We used to buy from Rosario, but he got busted by the feds, and we're looking for - a new hookup.
- Guys, we got company.
There's a lady with a dog, and a man with a ponytail.
Another lady with a dog, two dogs back to back, guys.
- Is that fishy?
- I knew Rosario.
- Seems fishy to me - So how's come - There's a lot of dogs out - I never heard of you?
Well, you can ask Rosario's guys about us.
They're right on top of each other.
If you think it's weird, just cough once for yes, - twice for no.
- I didn't come here to be accused of something.
We can buy from somebody else.
Jake, I need an answer, why is nobody coughing?
Hold up, I got a right to know - who I might be in business with.
- I need an answer on the dog thing, is it weird?
Can somebody cough?
Whose cough was that?
Was that you, Jake?
If it was you, cough twice, if it was somebody else, - cough three times.
-  Sorry, bad allergy day, pollen count is off the charts.
Pollen count, oh, man, how do you come up with that stuff?
- So what's your territory?
- But that's why you guys are - in there, and I'm out here.
- We don't sell on the streets.
We have loyal buyers that come to us.
- On the mic, you know - And we need quality product, - our customers are discerning.
- Check one, check two, check, - check, DJ C.J. on the mic.
- I got a guy that could get - you the best dope in the city.
- You know, I actually did DJ - my sister's wedding.
- But it ain't gonna be cheap.
It did not turn out well.
Apparently, there's such a thing - as too much Smash Mouth.
- I'm sorry, you think we wanna - deal with complete strangers?
- God, sometimes I look at my - sister, and I'm like - I mean, we gotta - cover our own asses.
- She's got two kids, - beautiful house, and I'm like - How do we know - this guy's even legit?
- C.J., what have you - done with your life?
- Shut up!
- Stop talking!
- Ahh!
- Shut up, now!
- Oh, my God.
Shut up, C.J. Oh, whoa, whoa, what are you, cops?
Yes, obviously we're cops.
Put your hands up.
Whoa, who said we were cops?
We haven't gotten any information we needed yet.
Jake, you're blowing it, man.
Stop talking!
Crime scene investigators combed every inch of Severino's restaurant, no drugs.
Well, we can't hold him much longer, and he's not talking.
The interrogation did not exactly go well.
You're gonna tell us who Flaco is, and you're gonna tell us right now.
Oh, that was crazy.
Well, there's one bit of good news.
The last call on Severino's phone was to a contact we believe to be Flaco.
We've tracked his location to a warehouse by the water.
We're gonna storm the place.
- Great, I'll go get C.J. - Why?
Why are you so determined to make him a part of this?
- No reason.
- If you actually cared about your sacred oath, you'd see that he's - a risk to the case.
-  Oh, my speech didn't actually inspire you, did it?
Ugh, all right, here's the truth.
If we catch Flaco, and C.J. gets credit for it, he's gonna transfer out of the Nine-Nine.
That's what this is all about?
You're still trying - to undermine the man?
- What?
No!
The opposite, if anything.
I want to see him succeed.
- I'm trying to overmine him.
- Oh, you know I hate it - when you make up words, Peralta.
- Are you still mad at me - for saying "snaccident"?
- Yes, very.
Please, just let him come along.
- No.
- Just so his name - is on the arrest report.
- No.
I'll put him in a car a block away.
Fine.
At least tell me what it was about my speech that didn't work for you.
Oh, man, if I had to boil it down to one thing and really pinpoint it, I guess I would just say it's, uh, ya boring.
But still let him come?
Great.
-  - What is all this?
Oh, hey, Sarge.
I'm growing tropical plants now in the warmth of my three space heaters.
It's getting a little hot though, wouldn't you say?
Ugh, oh, yeah.
Probably also turn on my portable air conditioning unit.
- Boop.
- You're not gonna beat me, Gina.
This is my last stand.
- My whole life is last stands.
- Gina, can I talk to you - for a second?
- Yeah, what's up?
Let me guess, you and Jake are having problems; you want me to teach you how to kiss?
- What?
No, stop that.
- Oh.
I know how I kiss, I've read books.
This is about Terry.
You can't tell - anyone else this, but - He failed his - lieutenant's exam.
- How do you know that?
Let's just say my little birds are everywhere collecting whispers.
He left the letter on his desk, and I read it.
Okay, but if you know he's depressed, then why - are you being so hard on him?
- Don't worry, I got this.
Just clear the lane - and let Gina do her thing.
- What?
Ugh.
Gina?
You locked me in.
Going to lunch.
Gina, you know I'm very claustrophobic.
Everybody ready?
Where's C.J.?
Parked a block away on Winthrop, as promised.
Don't worry, he's not going anywhere.
I downloaded an app on his phone that makes - your words sound like burps.
- Smart, really smart.
- Yeah.
- Here we go, on three, two, one.
- NYPD, on the ground.
- On the ground!
- Flaco, run!
- That's Flaco.
It's locked, go back.
- Oh, sorry.
- C.J., that's Flaco.
- You got him.
- Yeah!
He's out cold, how'd you do it?
No, no, wait.
Let me guess.
You opened your car door into him.
- Yep.
- He never saw it coming.
- Yep.
- And neither did you.
It was a total accident; you were getting out - of your car to go pee.
- No!
There was a spider in the car, and I panicked.
Damn it, how did I not guess that?
You gotta see this spider.
It's gigantic.
-  - Charles, this is amazing.
I know, when's the last time you cried like that?
- Huh?
You cried?
- Damn right, I did.
Oh, guess we gotta get back to the Nine-Nine.
Let's not be hasty.
Neither of us have any open cases right now, so should we tell the ladies - we're ready for round two?
- Let's do it, - you insatiable little minx.
- I'll go get 'em.
Mmm.
Charles, this place is a front, - money laundering or something.
- We gotta get out of here right now.
I just got off the phone with One Police Plaza.
They're thrilled.
Captain Stentley, you got your transfer.
- Whoo!
- I'm not transferring.
- What, why?
- The whole reason I wanted to transfer in the first place is because I didn't feel like I could do this job, but the mission tonight, me taking down Flaco - More the door than you.
- It just showed me that I can do this, and now I feel like I really do belong here.
So thank you, guys, for for making me believe in myself again.
- Oh.
- Come here.
That's gonna leave a mark.
I can't believe this.
Not only are we still stuck on the night shift, but now we have to watch C.J. get a medal.
Why are there so many reporters?
Even "The Times" is here.
Wait, really?
Who'd they send?
Wilson, Palmer, Schneier, Levine, Rogers, Tyler, Baker, Correal, Bromwich, Robbins, Schmidt?
Stop saying reporters' names.
How do you know so many names?
They're the only real rock stars we have left.
- Okay.
- Hello, we're here today to honor Captain Jason Stentley, who single-handedly brought down a major drug ring.
And so it is my pleasure to bestow upon him the Medal of Honor.
Captain Stentley.
Oh, bestow me, baby.
Ahh, wow, that's a lot of people.
Uh Baba Booey, Cornholio.
That's it for my prepared remarks.
Any questions?
Will taking down one drug dealer make a big difference in the overall level of drugs - moving into the city?
- No idea, next?
What's your philosophy for dealing with international narcotic supply chains?
Didn't understand the question, next.
Why was Flaco targeted for this operation?
Okay, there's a question I can answer.
Well, it all started because I lost a huge bag of cocaine, so I totally biffed it, you know, but - Thank you, thank you, Captain.
- Oh, oh.
- That That is That's plenty.
- That was a train wreck.
Yes, he never should have been put in that position.
Whoever recommended him for the medal and called all those reporters really messed up.
- Wait, what are you saying?
- Oh, nothing.
It just seems as if C.J. has been overmined.
- You did this?
- I did.
- And you used my made-up word.
- I hated it, "overmined".
What have I become?
Was this whole thing - even worth it?
- It was no snaccident.
So the foot massage place reported $7 million in profit last year.
To make that much, they'd have to massage 100 feet an hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the entire year.
Damn it, we have to shut them down.
Wait.
Let's not be hasty about this.
Let's think this through.
We wanna be smart about this.
Right, I mean, what if we bust them tonight, and then tomorrow I'm chasing a murderer, and I'm about to get him, and my foot cramps up?
- Due to lack of massaging.
- And then the murderer - gets away.
- Know who he kills next?
- The mayor.
- Oh, my God, the city - has no mayor now.
- It's chaos.
Rioting, looting, panic in the streets.
They gotta call in the National Guard, there's tanks rolling down 5th Avenue, declaring martial law.
It's insane.
All because we shut down - the foot massage place - That was doing God's work.
- What were we thinking.
- So it's agreed: we let them stay open for the sake of the city.
For the sake of the city.
We have to do our stupid jobs, don't we?
Yeah, let me get my stupid gun.
NYPD, get down on the comfortable matted floor.
Put your magical hands where we can see them.
You're under arrest for ruining something perfect.
And money laundering.
Yes, money laundering, whatever.
Gina, I've been thinking a lot about how you refuse - to give up Jacinta.
- That's right.
- She's never leaving.
- I know, which is why I decided to do the only fair thing.
- Space heaters for everyone.
- So what?
That sounds great.
- Everyone.
- Whoo-whee, - it's toasty in here.
- You're gonna be looking at that all night long.
Whoop, I think he's about to eat a hoagie.
Is that mayonnaise or sweat?
Ugh, fine, I give up.
You can take Jacinta.
Really?
And the other two space heaters, too?
All of them, you win.
I win?
I won.
- Amy, I won!
- You did it, Sarge.
You're gonna get our power usage down.
I don't care about that crap.
I took down Gina Linetti.
I did the impossible.
Terry is back on top.
- Diaper up!
What!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Jason Stentley has been transferred from active duty effective immediately.
Captain Raymond Holt will be taking his place, and, yes, he's taking - all of us with him.
- You mean Yes, Amy.
We're back on the day shift!
Nine-Nine!
All: Nine-Nine!
Come on and party tonight!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Thank you for joining me for what promises to be the diggity-dopest tree lighting in the history of the Nine-Nine.
I don't understand.
Where's the tree?
It was inside us all along.
Brilliant, Jake.
No, Charles, not everything was inside of us all along.
The tree is right here.
Cool.
Can we go now?
Obviously not.
Behold, the greatest inflatable tree that 'Murica has to offer.
And now, in the immortal words of Saint Nick, turn on the compressor.
-  -  You hear that?
It's the sound of Christmas.
It's deafening.
It's getting really big.
What size tree did you get?
It's a jumbo.
It says it's ten meters tall.
- That's - Roughly 32.81 feet.
Someone unplug it, unplug it now.
We can't.
It swallowed its own plug!
Everybody run!
Okay, the tree has been contained.
Wait, we left a man behind.
Jake!
Well, Terry's trapped in the break room forever.
Only thing we can do now is move on with our lives.
It's what Terry would've wanted.
Aah!
God bless us, every one?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Ah, the Boyles are here.
Good tidings.
Genevieve, hello, you're looking Sexy as a minx.
I was gonna say "festive," due to the scarf.
The bra underneath is insane.
- It is.
- Okay.
Parenthood has not changed you two.
Hey there, Nikolaj, my man.
- How you doing?
- Hi, Jake, we made Daddy Latvian Christmas cookies.
Want one?
- You bet I do.
- The potato really - brings out the vinegar.
- Neither of those are cookie things.
I'm just gonna put that back.
So, you excited for Christmas, bud?
- Yeah, I'm so excited.
- This is Nikolaj's first Christmas because the orphanage kept cancelling it.
Once it was blizzards, one it was fires, and once it was - Famine.
- That's right, famine.
- Oh.
- Papa promised me The best present ever: a Captain Latvia action figure!
Whoa, Captain Latvia?
What's his superpower?
- Can he talk to moose?
- No, possums.
- Worse.
- It's a very difficult toy to get in America, so I was worried when Charles told Nikolaj he would get him one.
I said, keep it a surprise, so you don't build up his expectations, but Charles said, "No way, I want to build expectations".
- Well, we all remember the conversation.
Well, work time for Daddy.
I'll see you guys later.
Okay, I love you guys so much.
- Love you.
- All right.
- Bye.
- Christmas is gonna be amazing!
Christmas is gonna suck.
I don't have the present.
What?
But you promised Nikolaj.
I ordered it a month ago from a Latvian toy store, and it still hasn't arrived yet.
The shipping company is giving me the runaround.
All right, so just get him a different present, like a Jet Ski or a hammer.
I don't know what kids are into.
Genevieve and I worked so hard to get Nikolaj to trust us when we brought him home.
That's gonna be destroyed, the way dry rot destroyed his orphanage.
- Trust me, it's gonna be fine.
- Really?
'Cause you said that about "Die Hard 5," Jake.
Oh.
It's not gonna be fine.
Finally, let's talk about community outreach.
Does anyone have any ideas about  Fa-la-la-la-la, la la la la Who are these golden-throated dorks?
- It's the MTA.
- That's right.
The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
I assumed you've climbed out of your rat tunnels to taunt us about tonight's charity caroling competition.
No, no, no, of course not.
We're here to wish you luck, since every year we - Kick - Your  Butts Enough.
You may have bested us before, but throttle back your ambitions.
Our voices are - Better?
- Awesome - Sing!
- Scully!
That was terrible.
I hope you're more prepared tonight, or else we'll have to file a missing persons report.
First name: "Your".
- Last name: "Dignity".
- Mm.
Come on, crew, let's hit the rails and buses.
Both great ways to get around the city.
I hate that we lose to those pasty-assed mole people every year.
Oh, there's no point in mincing your words.
They're knaves!
Captain, you kiss Kevin with that mouth?
You bet I do.
And tonight, I'm gonna sing with it.
We're taking down the MTA.
- Charles, what are you doing?
- Jah-nakeh.
- What?
- Jah-keh.
No idea what you're saying.
Why aren't you wearing a jacket?
Oh, jacket, got it.
Aw, it's freezing.
What are you doing out here?
I'm on the phone with Melvin's Import-Exports, the bastards who lost my Captain Latvia.
Now wrap me in your arms, I need body heat.
- All right.
-  - And you're nestling.
- Ugh, first those jerks said they lost my package, then they said they found it, then they had me on hold for three hours.
This is the only place I get reliable reception.
- I'm unwrapping for a sec.
- No, why?
'Cause I need my fingers to save the day like a fricking hero.
And boom.
Melvin's import is in Queens.
- Let's just go there right now.
- Oh, so they could just walk all over me in person instead of on the phone?
- Face it, Jake, I'm weak.
- What?
Don't talk like that.
You're very strong, all right?
And you're a parent now, which makes you even stronger.
I mean, think about all those moms who literally lift buses off their kids every day.
Oh, so you're saying I should tap into my mommy strength.
Yeah, or daddy strength, but whatever.
Right, time to put some daddy into my mommy.
Gotta be a better way to phrase that, let's go.
Okay, let's review our simple harmonies.
When I point at you, hit your note.
- La - La La   La Okay.
That was horrible.
Because I didn't get a chance to rap.
Pop, pop, droppin' bodies It's a stickup you punk a No, Hitchcock, there's no rapping.
You've grossly misread the situation.
Maybe we just need to practice more.
I, for one, felt like I was a teeny bit off.
Don't fool yourself, Santiago.
You were the most off of everyone.
That's enough.
Sure, we're untrained.
Yes, our voices sound like garbage, and, yes, the MTA has a huge head start on us, and it's embarrassing.
But you know what?
We're the Nine-Nine.
And nothing can stand in our way.
She's right.
We're gonna beat their butts tonight.
Oh, tonight?
Tonight, tonight?
Yeah, I can't.
I have "Hamilton" tickets.
Oh, well.
Good luck.
Peace.
I'm out too.
I mean, if we're just gonna be humiliated, I don't s - Wait, shut up.
- Did you just tell - yourself to shut up?
- Yeah, now you shut up too.
- Listen.
- Mother and child - You hear that?
- It's an angel who will save us.
Tender and mild It's coming from the bullpen.
Sleep in heavenly peace Who's singing?
Is it one of the uniformed officers?
No, it is not.
Heavenly peace - Our angel's a criminal.
- And our angel is drunk.
-  -  The angel puked.
- Hey, you Melvin?
- I am, who are you?
I'm Charles, from being on hold, and I want my package.
Yeah, I already told you, that package isn't here.
Well, I made a sacred promise to my son, and you're not gonna make a liar out of me, so why don't you take another look?
We'll wait.
'Cause we've got all night long.
- Damn.
- Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but I'm a cop.
So maybe this time, don't lie to me.
Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.
Well, now you do, genius.
- How do you keep doing that?
- I don't know.
All right, all right, hold on.
Look, there's a Latvian gang, okay, the Gals Skepu.
They smuggle guns in containers that come from Latvia.
Sometimes there's other packages that get lost in the process, okay?
If you want to find yours, - you gotta find them.
- Gun-running gangsters, huh?
Well, looks like we're gonna take down the Latvian mob.
Hell yeah, we are.
Is it bleeding?
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Charles, is it bleeding?
- Thanks, Melvin.
- I want a Band-Aid.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I just talked to Crawford from Organized Crime.
Apparently, the Gals Skepu are major gun-runners on the east coast.
Their leader's got an office in the back.
Also, great chest hair.
Ah, Genevieve calls it "the plume of Boyle".
Aww, that's so yucky.
Hey, do you think this shirt is offensive?
I'm just not sure how it fits into my ensemble.
Come on, focus, Jake.
My boy's happiness is at stake.
I mean, read the email Genevieve just sent me.
Skip the part about her bra.
Impossible, it's in all caps, bolded.
- Oh.
- HERE WE  "Nik-Nik is so excited you're getting him Captain Latvia".
And then there's a photo of him karate chopping a cat.
Oh, yeah, that's Captain Latvia's move, the Riga Hammer.
You hit a guy here, he goes down instantly.
- Sounds a little far-fetched.
- Okay, well, tell that to Captain Latvia's enemies.
Oh, wait, you can't - because they're unconscious.
- Okay, the door is guarded by the mob.
You wanna figure out our plan?
Already did.
Mommy's gonna talk her way in.
Hey there, jokers.
I got a joke for you: What did one Estonian farmer say to the other?
Our crop yields are so much smaller than that of mighty Latvia.
Okay.
Come on in.
Oh, laughing is fun.
The question on the table is, do we add a velvet-voiced drunkard to our caroling group, or do we lose miserably like a bunch of miserable losers?
I say we do it, and I'm the boss.
Therefore, meeting adjourned.
I can't believe you're even considering this, Captain.
The guy's a criminal.
Barely.
It was public intoxication.
All he did was pee on a couple snowmen.
And one regular man.
Plus, it'll count toward his community service.
In a certain way, we'll be furthering the cause of justice.
Santiago, breaking the rules makes you all sweaty.
You can't be okay with this.
These pits are bone-dry.
The drunk sings.
The drunk sings.
Thank you very much.
Did you unbutton another button?
Eyes up here, Jake.
So, did you learn anything, or were you just staring at my body the whole time?
Weird, but I did find out who the manager is, and I'm almost positive she's got a key to the back office on her right now.
Her name is Svetlana.
Thanks.
I'll take it from here.
Wait, Charles, she doesn't speak any English, and we don't wanna blow our cover.
- Do you speak any Latvian?
- Well, I learned a few phrases for Nikolaj, but I'm not gonna use words with Svetlana.
Don't say you're gonna use your musk.
- I'm gonna use my musk.
- Okay.
It's a pretty juicy crowd out there.
Okay, everyone, remember your role.
Patrick, solos.
Scully, mouth percussion.
Rosa, mouth percussion.
Amy, silent mouth percussion I can't even mouth percuss?
No.
Terry, mouth percussion.
- Hitchcock stay backstage.
- You got it.
We walk out one by one, bum-bum-bumming, then Patrick sings us to victory.
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for "The 99th Precinct".
Bum, bum, bum bum, bum, bum Bum, bum, buuum Now, Patrick.
Now.
Mm-mm.
Mm-mm, no, too many people.
Too many.
Sir, say something.
I'm sorry, but there's been a police emergency.
There's a bomb.
Not here, far away, but they still need us.
So Merry Christmas.
And don't think about the bomb.
Bye.
- That sounded great.
- Not now, Hitchcock.
What the hell happened out there, Patrick?
I'm really sorry.
There were so many people.
- I-I got stage fright.
- I don't get it.
You had no problem singing in front of the entire precinct.
I was drunk.
Alcohol gives me the courage to sing.
And the courage to pee on snow people.
Well, well, well.
I made a couple calls, and imagine my surprise when I found out that the only bomb out there was you guys.
Yeah, well, it looks like the only train in here - is the train.
- Tell him, Amy.
Train, training, training wheels.
You're circling, find it, find it.
Wheels!
You are wheels.
Nope.
Fantastic dancer.
Wow, Boyle, you got more moves than Bobby Fischer who I saw a documentary about last week.
Flattery will get you everywhere, Jake.
Follow me.
I figure we got 15 minutes before the pheromones wear off, and she realizes I took the key.
I was spraying 'em like a skunk out there.
Ugh.
I got nothing.
No shipping records, no addresses, nothing about illegal guns, and nothing about Captain Latvia.
Well, they're obviously not gonna broadcast what they did with Captain Latvia.
They're not fools.
We should go.
We've been here too long.
This is getting dangerous.
Well, danger is my maiden name.
- Middle name.
- So you better keep looking, because I'm not gonna let my kid down, not tonight.
- Ugh.
-  Crap, we've got company.
I told you we had to leave.
I found a tablet.
This could be something.
Hey, thank God you're here.
Do you think this shirt is offensive?
Do the Riga Hammer.
But that's not a real thing.
Ahh!
-  - Jake!
Oh, you wanna do this in Latvian?
Fine.
-  - -  - Oh!
What were you guys talking about?
Did he think the shirt was racist?
-  - So, pretty crazy how you took out that Latvian mob guy back there.
I know, I felt like a superhero, like the Hulk's mom.
- Why the mom?
- Hey, is there anything on that tablet that will lead us to his toy?
I don't know, it's locked, but don't worry.
Our tech guys will get it open in no time.
Pssh, I don't have time for those dorks.
What?
But you love Ted and Craig.
You fly kites with them every weekend.
They're good guys.
Give me the damn tablet!
What?
No, Charles, you're driving.
Ugh.
1234?
Nope.
- 5555?
Damn it.
- Stop.
If you keep getting it wrong, we're gonna get locked out forever.
That's a risk I have to take.
Boom, did it, 5683.
Fifth most common pass code this year.
It spells - "Love".
- "Fart".
Yep, "love".
Now find me something I could use.
Never thought I'd have to say "a please would be nice," but okay.
Oh, here we go.
There are a bunch of messages about a warehouse in Crown Heights.
Crown Heights, that's where we're going.
-  - Hey, Charles, - that was a yellow light!
- I proceeded with caution.
Glory to the new born king Those MTA jerks just texted us a GIF of a cartoon subway train mooning a cop.
They sent it from the stage.
We cannot let this stand.
But there's no way we can beat them.
What do we do?
My rapping's still on the table.
It's not even in the dining room.
We need a new singer.
I hate to say this, but I think we should withdraw from the competition.
Smart, then we can sit in the audience and throw batteries at those MTA-holes.
Guys, personally, I think we should go out there and just sing our best.
Caroling isn't about competing.
It's about having fun together.
Well, now that you put it that way, Scully, it makes me realize Rosa and Terry are right.
I say we quit the competition and hurl projectiles at the MTA.
What's up, y'all?
Guess who just saved your asses?
That's right.
Miss Not Good Enough To Audibly Percuss.
- Who?
- Me!
I saved the flipping day.
Got Patrick drunk, listen.
I can sing Are you serious, Santiago?
That is ethically questionable.
Ugh.
It's a bus pooping on a police car.
Let's beat those bastards.
Okay, this looks like the place.
Now, let's get in there and take down some bad boys.
Hell yes, let's do that, in 10 minutes after backup arrives, and not until then.
Look, I want this to be a very special day for Nikolaj.
There's a gang of armed men in there, and we've done zero recon.
I won't let you go in, I mean it.
All right.
We'll wait for back up.
Great, thank you.
Only I'm not waiting.
What?
Charles, no.
Charles, stop scooching.
I am going to scooch.
You don't tell me - when to scooch.
- I can't get by.
- Curse my beautiful bubble butt.
- See, all Boyle men are blessed with a flat ass, which is perfect for scooching.
- Why are you acting this way?
- 'Cause I made a promise to my son.
You can't understand 'cause you're not a father.
You never will be.
- Hey, yes, I will!
- When, Jake?
We're all waiting.
What are we even arguing about now?
It's about me saving Christmas, duh.
Oh, damn it, my pants are snagged, Ha-hah!
Now you have to wait for backup.
No, I don't.
I'm gonna shimmy them off.
Oh, God, the eye contact is the worst part.
Ah.
I told you, Jake.
I'll do anything to perk up my little man.
You gotta know how gross that sounds in your underwear.
Thank you for allowing us to return.
Turns out there wasn't a bomb.
It was a clock made by an over-achieving minority student.
What a world we live in.
Now let's sing.
Bum, bum, bum.
Bum, bum, bum.
Bum, bum, buuum Joy to the world, the Lord is come Let Earth receive her king Let everyone Eat my farts -  -  Yeah, I said it.
New York City sucks.
Hoboken for life!
Whoo!
-  -   Can't talk right now, Jake.
I'm a busy little bee.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up.
Just tell me what's going on so I know where to send backup when it arrives.
Uh, I'm north of the loading bay.
I have eyes on the shipment.
There are only ten guys.
Only?
That's too many guys.
They're removing guns.
All right, they're taking the other boxes Oh, no, they're burning them.
They're gonna burn Captain Latvia.
I have to go right now.
It's too risky.
They have a ton of weapons.
Doesn't matter.
I'm going in there, - and no one can stop me.
-  -  -  The Riga Hammer.
It works.
Ugh, where am I?
Why the hell am I wearing pants?
Oh, I put 'em back on you after I Riga Hammered you.
-  - Yeah, it works.
- Insane.
- Oh Look, I couldn't let you go in there solo.
I'm sorry, I feel terrible for saving your life.
Enough of your dumb apologies, Jake.
SWAT's here, we have to move on these guys now.
No, Charles, you know what I realized when I saw you standing over there in your underwear?
That my butt is like a sexy piece of drywall?
What?
No, eww.
You guys gonna be much longer?
It's Christmas Eve.
Just give us one sec, Marv.
No, what I realized is, the best gift you can give Nikolaj is not Captain Latvia.
- What?
- It's you, being there - with him, alive.
- But I promised him Yeah, but you also promised him - you were gonna be his father.
- I'm worried - we're gonna lose tactical.
- Back off, Marv, we get it.
- Come on, Marvin.
- Look, we can handle this - without you just go home.
- Thanks, Jake.
And I'm sorry I said you'll never be a dad.
You will be, and you can make it happen tonight.
Just go to Amy and make sure afterwards that she holds her knees to her chest for at least All right, I think I'm good on this.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
All right, Marv, be honest with me.
What do you think of this shirt?
It's a little inappropriate.
I knew it.
All right, let's just go on three.
Ready?
One, two, go, go, go, go, go, go.
Once again, the MTA has bested us.
We should never have trusted a Hoboken drunk.
"Hamilton" was amazing!
How is no one talking about this musical?
It's so good.
Wow, you guys look more upset than Aaron Burr, sir.
That's from the musical "Hamilton," which I just discovered, basically.
We lost the caroling competition.
And now we hate singing.
Almost as much as we hate the MTA.
Yeah, so we should prank call their tip line with a series of well-crafted insults.
We should toilet paper their houses.
- With rocks.
- Come on, guys.
Getting back at people isn't what Christmas is all about.
It's about being together, as a family.
So you can plot your petty revenge, but I, for one, am gonna carol my heart out.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear a word you just said.
That stain on your pants looks exactly like Bryan Cranston.
- That's who it is.
- Ooh, that's right.
Yeah, been staring at it for an hour.
- That's it.
- Oh.
- Hey.
- Jake, what happened?
Well, we arrested 12 guys, confiscated 35 automatic weapons, and I found Captain Latvia.
You did?
Oh, my God!
Uh, melted.
I found him extremely melted.
And grotesque.
Probably should've - strung that together faster.
- Well, that's okay.
You taught me that Christmas isn't about presents.
No, forget all that crap.
Presents rule.
Here, give him this.
From you.
It's a police man, just like you, Papa.
This is the coolest present ever.
"I'm Detective Papa, and I'm going to go to the Farmers Market.
I hope they have aged Gouda".
Oh, my God, I'm melting.
I'm literally turning into a puddle.
Genevieve, hold me.
I got you, babe.
Oh, honey, that flat ass is perched right on top of my ute.
I'm gonna pretend none of that was said for the sake of the child.
Wait a minute, is that Scully?
Five golden rings Four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves And a partridge in a pear tree Hey, guys, thought I'd spread the Christmas cheer.
Cool, so you're just out here caroling solo?
Yeah, I guess you could say that.
No, you can't.
He's not solo.
- You guys came.
- Damn right we did.
A one, a two, a one, two, three  Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh They're really bad singers, Papa.
Yes, they are.
They're horrible.
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Tell me when to go tell me when to go  Tell me when to go  Tell me when to go tell me when to go  What the hell?
Man, they forgot my pico de gallo.
Oh, love the shirt, Jake.
Lilith Fair '98 had the best lineup.
Meshell Ndegeocello crushed it that year.
Thank you, Boyle, but this is not my shirt.
I slept at Amy's and I spilled ranch dressing on mine.
Don't you have a drawer full of clothes at her place by this point?
Yeah, I spilled ranch dressing all over the drawer.
What's so hard to understand about this, guys?
Why don't you two move in together already?
I thought you were planning to.
We are.
We just haven't decided whose apartment we're going to live in.
I think Jake should move into mine, because it's bigger, nicer, and isn't covered in black mold.
Black mold, Amy?
Not cool.
- Right, Terry?
- What?
I rest my case.
Besides, my place is cheaper and it's in a cooler neighborhood.
Yeah.
That neighborhood is technically called Cobblestink.
All right, everyone.
Listen up.
We have a situation.
Ten minutes ago, a prison van overturned on Nevins Street.
It was carrying nine convicts who are now at large.
It's our job to bring them in.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a manhunt.
A manhunt.
Okay, what I want from each and every one of you is a hard-target search of every gas station, residence, warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse, and doghouse in the area.
Your fugitive's name is Dr. Richard Kimble.
There must be some sort of error.
There are nine fugitives, and none of them are named Kimble.
- I didn't kill my wife!
- What?
You're supposed to go, "I don't care"!
- I don't care.
- Let the manhunt begin.
Patrol officers have secured a ten-block perimeter.
All civilians are being evacuated.
Here's what the convicts were in for: arson, kidnapping, racketeering, assault and battery, forgery and counterfeiting, triple homicide.
Whoo!
What?
I'm not excited about the murders.
I'm excited about the chance to avenge them.
You guys are the weird ones.
Diaz, I want you here with me interviewing witnesses.
The rest of you will search the secured area in the following teams: Santiago, Boyle; Jeffords and Peralta.
Get to work.
Okay.
We'll start south of Nevins.
You two start at Bond and we'll rendezvous in the middle, assuming, of course, Boyle and I haven't already caught all the fugitives by the time you two show up.
Amy, there are nine hardened criminals running free in the streets.
This is hardly the time for childish trash talk.
It's time for a bet.
- A crazy-ass bet.
- What are you thinking?
Whoever catches the most fugitives gets to keep their apartment.
Loser moves in with the winner.
All right.
I'm in.
I hope you like sleeping in a bed with a thousand pillows.
Well, I hope you like sharing my one grey towel.
Was it grey when you bought it?
I didn't buy it.
It was in the apartment when I moved in.
Are you sure you don't want to just move in with me?
We already shook on it.
The bet stands.
Prepare to die, and by "die," I mean move in with me.
Here we go.
I get that the streets are empty, but slow down, man.
Terry forgot his Dramamine.
Stakes are high, Sarge.
I know it doesn't matter to you, but I really want to beat Amy.
Doesn't matter?
Look, I am completely on board.
You need your own space.
I had a painting studio in my apartment.
Was this in the '90s?
Did you wear overalls and no shirt?
- Every chance I got.
-  But then I moved in with Sharon.
And then the kids came along.
You know where I have to paint now?
My acrylics!
I am not gonna let you lose this bet.
The march toward the closet starts with a single step.
Cool.
So, basically just telling me not to get married and have kids Anything from dispatch?
Security footage from a bank near the accident.
Two fugitives ran past going north toward Flatbush.
Looks like the arsonist and the gun runner.
Let's go after the arsonist first.
I thought of the perfect thing to say when we catch him that no one else could ever have possibly "You're burnt"?
No.
Initial reports had one of the fugitives heading south on Lincoln Place.
On it.
So, I know you're Jake's best friend, and Did he say that?
Did you get that on tape?
- No.
- No, he didn't say that or no, you didn't get it on tape?
Doesn't matter.
Either way, you screwed up big time.
Anyway, all I'm saying is I know you're Jake's best friend and you really want him to win this bet Are you kidding?
That's the last thing I want.
Jake moving in with you is my dream come true.
Your apartment is two blocks away from mine.
Jake will be able to pop by any time.
Imagine it.
He's had a tough day.
He's fighting with Amy.
You know how you let things escalate.
So, he just walks over to my place, bottle of wine in hand, and we just talk it out.
And then by the time that bottle's finished, you've come to your senses and apologized.
Maybe I don't want to win this bet.
Okay, we need to figure out whether this crash was an accident or part of a deliberate escape plan.
Gina, I need you manning the tip line.
Ha-ha!
Good luck talking to the crazies.
Crazies?
Oh, Rosa.
Sad Rosa.
Have some respect for your fellow human beings.
What has gotten into you?
Solange just posted a video of a Kenyan human rights activist, Abdala, and I realized he and I are the only two people that can save the world.
I'm so excited.
Okay, Diaz, there are only two witnesses who were close enough to the crash to see something.
One's on his way here already.
His name is Marshawn Lynch.
Marshawn Lynch?
Marshawn Lynch the football player?
I don't know his hobbies.
It just says here he's unemployed.
Retired.
We're not getting anything out of him.
He's always getting fined for refusing to talk to the press.
Ugh, he's kind of one of my heroes.
Well, it may be tough, and it may take a while, but I'm sure we'll get him to open up.
Sir, there are some vaults you just can't open.
I ain't seen anything.
I was eating my quesadilla.
It was a good one.
Chicken, cheese, guac.
But they forgot my pico de gallo.
I remember when I was a little boy, my mama used to make this, uh, she used to call it "fo' cheese".
What y'all call it?
Y'all call it "four"?
How come they never make quesadillas with sausage?
You throw some tomato sauce in there and call it a pizza-dilla What you think?
What is going on?
This one time, I tried to wait up all night to catch Santa Claus, right?
You know how they tell you you got to put the cookies and the milk out?
I don't really be telling nobody this, but I like to sleep with the fan on, even when it's chilly outside.
All about that white noise, baby.
Stop.
Stop talking, Marshawn Lynch.
Did you see anything after the van crashed?
Yes or no?
Nope.
Like I told you, I was just eating my quesadilla.
Have I talked to y'all about my pizza-dilla invention?
Yes, well, I have other matters to attend to.
So, Detective Diaz, just take down everything Mr. Lynch has to say.
- Captain -  You think he'll let me shoot his gun?
Jake, look.
You think it's our guys?
Maybe.
But this is New York, so there's a very strong chance it's just "city blood".
- NYPD!
Freeze!
- Freeze!
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the precinct escaped convict number one!
Terry, where's the music?
That was the cue.
I didn't have that Queen song on my phone.
I wasn't gonna pay $1.99 for it.
Nice work, man.
You can put your perp in holding with the other three convicts.
- Wait.
Other three?
- Yeah.
Santiago and Boyle brought them in.
That's right.
It's three to one.
Guess you won't be needing this anymore since you'll be moving in with me.
- My towel.
- Yeah, your towel.
Why won't it burn?
Because it never fully dries.
The towel lives, and so do we!
Hey, Santiago, how did you guys catch three perps so quickly?
They weren't even close to each other.
Given the magnitude of the situation, we were given full access to any and all department resources.
That's right.
We took a little trip down to the tactical supply armory.
No, you did not!
Thermal imaging, baby.
Thermal imaging baby?
Very handy in fugitive hunting.
Also I got this Flo-Tech performance polo with moisture-wicking technology.
Kept me dry all morning.
And a dry is a smart boy.
Ugh, he keeps saying that.
Charles, you've gotten negative reactions from everyone who's heard it.
I needed to see what Jake thought.
- Oh, I hated it.
- Really?
Anyway, gentlemen, we are off to catch some more convicts.
Two more, and we win.
Huh, just two?
No sweat.
Literally.
Get out of here.
Take those glass cutters with you.
Oh, these lil' ol' things?
- Tsst.
- What?
Why'd you put your finger in the middle?
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
I was wondering if you could answer some questions about the car accident you witnessed this morning.
- What's she trying to tell us?
- I don't know.
Probably "Never meet your heroes, 'cause they're gonna turn out to be friendly".
You need to get over this Marshawn Lynch situation real quick.
Now, we just have to figure out what language she's speaking so we can find a translator.
Here, ma'am.
Take a look at this map of the world.
You just keep one of those on you?
Of course.
In case I ever need to prove my point in an argument.
- Laos.
- Fine!
Oh, it was better than fine.
It was Laos.
- Mm.
- So, where are you from?
Where did you grow up?
Where were you born?
What are you miming there, sir?
A child tying his tie.
Uh-huh.
I'm trying to do a simple Half Windsor so she knows I'm a baby.
Look at this.
See how basic this knot is?
I love these thermal goggles.
Amy, listen to me very carefully.
If you and Jake are thinking of trying, you are ovulating like crazy right now.
You take that helmet off before I knock it off.
What?
Your basal temperature is off the charts.
This is a good thing.
Boyle!
NYPD!
Get down!
Freeze!
Aah!
The room's hot.
I'm blowing out.
This way.
Come on.
Oh, come on!
Where did you guys even come from?
-  - Your nightmares.
Hey, Amy, allow me to introduce you to Big Bertha.
Okay, I guess I'm not worth introducing to your truck.
That's right, y'all.
We went to Homeland Security.
Yep, this beauty comes fully equipped with thermal imaging, a satellite link-up, and she plugs in to every surveillance camera in the city.
And she's also got a holding cell, which is big enough for three perps.
Jake, counting this guy, how many perps have we caught and placed in the three-perp perp cell?
Well, Sarge, we've placed three perps in the three-perp perp cell.
So, the three-perp perp cell's full?
Full of three perps is the three-perp perp cell.
Okay, stop saying "perps" and "cell" and "three".
You sound irritated.
What's the score now?
Are you guys still ahead?
Let me just check.
Oh, drone!
Little help?
Yeah, I can't read that score.
What does it say?
Anyway, I'm sure you're tracking whatever the score is.
All right, thank you, drone.
That'll be all.
Whoop!
Didn't see the tree there.
Big Bertha has a drone.
That's what's important.
What are you trying to tell us?
Is this some kind of a clue?
Draw better.
We have no idea what this is.
- I think it's a cookie.
- No.
It's a pizza.
It's a cookie pizza!
Another case solved.
No.
Detectives, we Shh shh shh.
Let them go.
She's taking us somewhere.
This is good.
This is good.
We're gonna crack this, Diaz.
Nope.
She just needed to take a dump.
Okay, satellite images showed one of the two remaining convicts entered this building.
If we catch him, that's five.
I win the bet.
Amy moves in with me.
I lord it over her.
She's miserable.
We live happily ever after.
It's fool-proof.
There's got to be 30 floors in this building.
It'll take forever to sweep the whole place.
Nuh-uh.
We can use Big Bertha to tap into the security cameras.
- Ohh.
-  Okay.
This room is clear, but check that closet.
Man, this is like playing the coolest video game ever.
My character is Terry.
- It's locked.
- Ooh, kick it down.
Front kick!
Front kick!
- All clear.
- Now strafe.
Strafe!
I don't know what that means.
- Barrel roll.
Duck.
- Duck?
Just tell me where to go, man.
Wait a minute.
Slide one of your feet forward.
Now switch.
Now punch both your fists forward at the same time.
Are you making me do the running man?
Yeah.
The original one.
Excluding the movie.
And Stephen King's classic short story.
So, the third iteration.
I'm going off on my own.
He has sentience.
It's "Westworld".
Oh, wait a minute, Sarge.
I don't have eyes on that room.
Hang on.
I'll find it.
Oh, no.
Sarge, just hang on.
I'm coming for you.
Drop the weapon.
- You drop your weapon.
- Okay, stay cool.
We can work this out.
I'm a trained hostage negotiator.
I got my friend's sperm back from his ex-wife last year.
Well, she destroyed half of it, and he decided to adopt, but - Peralta!
- Right.
Sorry.
What do you want?
You let me walk out of this building and get into a car.
- If anyone tries to stop me -  Got him.
Oh, well, you know, I think that makes it four to four.
No.
No.
You don't get credit for this guy.
I was in the middle of negotiating, and he was about to give up Tell him, guy.
No, I was probably gonna kill him, then let you kill me.
Oh, my God.
I should've been way more scared.
Well, there's just one convict left.
Whoever finds him wins.
Yeah.
I guess you could say he's the Golden Snitch.
Wait.
Was that a "Harry Potter" reference?
It most definitely was.
I started reading them - 'cause you love them so much.
- And?
You were right.
They're incredible.
Remember when I called in sick the other day?
I was at home reading "Order of the Phoenix".
Oh, this makes me so happy!
How sad is it when Cedric dies?
I was crushed.
Literally crying on the toilet.
Aww.
Guys.
The fugitive.
The bet?
Right.
I'm gonna catch this last fugitive, win the bet, and then we're gonna live together for the rest of our relationship.
Just you and me and towel makes three.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Just so you know, at the end of the sixth book, Snape kills La-la-la-la-!
No spoilies!
Terry, let's go.
It really sounds Slavic.
Does anyone here know any Slavic languages?
Oh, I'm great at languages.
Watch this.
Hello!
I am Hitchcock!
Thank you for the cookie-pizza idea!
I believe it was human rights leader Abdala who once said "When the choir shouts the loudest, the most powerful one is silent".
That doesn't even make any sense.
Well, I might have paraphrased it incorrectly.
But allow me to introduce to you Rob.
Rob, come on in.
He called the tip line.
But he's so not crazy-looking.
Rosa, have Abdala and I taught you nothing about stereotyping?
I'm beginning to feel like you're our biggest project, sweetie.
That's enough.
What did he tell you?
Well, let's find out, okay?
Together.
Rob, do you want to share your experience with the group?
Gladly.
Okay, so, you know how there's a subterranean race of lizard-people living beneath the city who control our minds with their pheromones?
Okay, he's a wackadoodle.
Gina, get your wackadoodle out of here.
It's been two hours, and nothing on the last guy.
He's gonna get away.
Where are you, number nine?
Think.
If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?
-  - Where?
Oh, I have no idea.
I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.
And I did.
No, that didn't work either.
Or did it?
Still no.
- Unless - Stop it, Jake!
Well, Marshawn Lynch will not leave your office.
He has now pulled up one of those wedding proposal viral videos on his phone and is crying.
What did I do to deserve this?
Well, I haven't fared any better.
She keeps drawing her stupid circle pictures and then running off to the bathroom.
We get it.
You have a bum-tum.
Yes.
Ugh!
You think you guys have it rough.
I've been stuck here listening to crazy Rob spew his insane garbage What happened to your positive attitude, Abdala?
Don't even say that name, all right?
I tweeted him and got nothing.
Meanwhile, Rob tweets him some crap about lizard-people, he's like, "Oh, retweet, oh, fave" everything.
I just told him I saw one of them slip back into his lizard home under the streets.
That's where they make their soup.
Oh, my God.
He's onto something.
Captain, don't try to be nice by giving a crazy person a voice.
Plus, we've already learned that human rights are crap.
No, he said that the lizard-people live under the streets.
He means the sewers.
He saw someone go from the van into the sewers.
Look.
It's a manhole cover.
Peralta, Santiago?
- Yeah, we're here.
- Us too, Captain.
We have a lead.
One of our witnesses saw the last convict, George Gessilnick, the murderer, go down into a manhole and escape into the sewer near the crash site.
Copy that.
We're on it.
Yeah, so are we.
We're also on it.
Whoop!
Back it up a little bit.
Forward.
Back.
Forward.
Back.
Forward.
Back.
Forward.
And we're good to go.
Oh, almost clipped the mailbox.
Heh.
Close call.
Please let this muck be water.
Please let this muck be water.
I won't be able to hug Nicolaj for a month.
He doesn't have all his shots yet.
Shh.
I think I heard something.
I can't believe Leonardo lived in this.
I mean, Michelangelo I get.
He's kind of a sloppy dude.
- But Leo is so fastidious.
- Jake, shut up.
Sarge, we're in a sewer.
I'm goin'st to talk about the Turtles.
No, Jake.
Shut up.
I hear something.
NYPD!
Freeze!
NYPD!
Keep your hands where we can see them.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Why did you stop?
I'm done.
You win.
W-what?
I love you.
I want to move in to your apartment.
Really?
I love you too.
Oh, my God, what a beautiful moment.
And, you guys, Amy's ovulating as we speak!
- What?
- Charles!
All right, head to the back.
You're going to jail.
Hey.
I don't get it.
Why did you decide to let me win?
I don't know.
When we were back there racing through the Miranda Rights, I just looked over at you and thought, "You're awesome.
And you're good at doing things".
I mean, sure, I'll miss towel, but your happiness is worth way more than winning some stupid bet.
- Are you sure about this?
- Oh, yeah.
Your apartment is better than mine in every way imaginable.
You want to know what my first thought was when we dropped into the sewer?
"Smells like home".
He's lying, Amy.
His first thought was about the Ninja Turtles.
Come on, Terry.
We were in a sewer.
He's gon'sta think about the Turtles.
Yeah, I'm gon'sta, Terry.
- Quit being such a Malfoy.
- Yeah, Terry.
Guys, we have a problem.
He's not our convict.
What?
The guy in the orange jumpsuit that we found hiding in the sewer is not our convict?
He's our van driver.
A man came to me last week.
He told me I had to help Gessilnick escape from jail.
He had pictures of my family.
He said he'd kill them if I didn't help.
So, I crashed the van, and Gessilnick took my clothes.
But then where's the guy we thought was the van driver?
He vanished.
George Gessilnick, posing as a Department of Corrections driver, was taken to the hospital, where he escaped some hours later.
He's highly dangerous, probably armed, and could be anywhere.
Detective Diaz has some background information to help in the search.
So this is one scary dude.
We don't have a complete rap sheet on him because he's had so many aliases, but we know he's killed at least five people.
He's been in the system since he was 11.
That's when he stole $4,000 from his foster family and burned their house down.
Wait a minute.
This is the foster family?
- Yeah.
Why?
- Did you see who the brother is?
I need to get a message to somebody.
This is very important.
Tell him Jake Peralta wants to see him.
I'm not after him.
I just need his help.
Hello?
I followed all your rules.
I'm unarmed.
I'm not wearing a wire.
I came alone.
There's no backup.
Come on, man.
I need your help to take down your brother.
Doug Judy.
The Pontiac Bandit.
Hey, baby.
Nice legs.
Why are you in your boxers?
So you would know I'm not wearing a wire.
Your buddy Scott said I had to.
Oh, that makes sense.
Scott's a perv.
Hey, Scott, wherever you're watching from, go home!
Sorry, man.
So, what's so important?
I'm looking for your foster brother, George.
Hate the guy.
Stole from my mom, burned our house down.
Worst of all, he ran off with my LP of Phil Collins' "No Jacket Required".
It's my favorite album.
Haven't heard it in 20 years.
I mean, can't you just stream it?
Can't do that to Phil.
"Sussudio" demands vinyl.
Right.
Vinyl and whatnot.
Okay, well, George is a murderer now and he just escaped from prison.
We think he might be trying to flee the country.
You want me to help you catch him?
Like when X-men teamed up with Magneto to stop Apocalypse.
- I heard that one was bad.
- Wasn't great.
- I still want to see it though.
- I'd watch it again.
- So, does that mean you're in?
- Course I am.
Damn, it feels good to be on the same team for once.
A cop and a criminal working together.
We need a theme song.
The Pontiac Bandit and Jake the cop - Oh!
- Taking down crooks In the streets where they live Flirting with girls who are hot for the badge There's a talking police dog that helps them solve crime You gave him full immunity?
Are you insane?
You told me to cut a deal.
I thought you'd maybe drop charges on one or two felonies.
But do you know how many crimes we're forgiving?
- Six - That's not so bad.
- Hundred!
- Oh, that's way more.
"Grand theft auto.
Grand theft auto.
Grand theft auto.
Dog fraud".
I sold a guy a fake Pekinese.
'Twas a cat.
You will not win me over with your use of "'twas".
- 'Twasn't trying to.
-  You're clearly friends with this man, and you've lost your objectivity, Peralta.
Or have you lost your objectivity?
What are you doing?
My bad.
I thought we were leaving.
No.
I'm just making a point here.
Sit down.
Look, sir.
There's a triple-murderer loose in Brooklyn, and it's our job to bring him in, even if that means forgiving a guy who stole some cars, and, yes, sold a few cats as dogs.
More than a few.
Weird how many people fell for that.
Plus, his deal is conditional.
If Judy doesn't lead us to his brother, he doesn't get immunity.
Look, Cap, I want to see George behind bars as much as you do.
I hate my brother.
You can relate to that, right, sir?
Remember how furious you got that time your sister ended an email with "thx" instead of "thanks"?
Why would you bring that up?
- It seemed pertinent.
- Fine.
Let's see where this leads.
Dismissed.
So we don't know if anybody helped George Judy escape from this hospital.
Security cameras show him entering this courtyard, but never coming back out.
The dude just vanished.
Ugh.
Terry hates hospitals.
They reek of death.
Ahem.
Oh, not you, ma'am.
You reek of life.
Maybe he went up the wall like this.
Never mind.
It's not possible.
You sure?
Damn, Rosa!
How did you do that?
I have a dark past.
Now you know my deepest shame.
Cool.
Well, now that I saw you do it, I get how to do it too.
-  - Ooh, damn, Terry.
Hey, guys.
Guess what.
To thank you for being such good friends, I picked up a big old basket of muffins.
Follow me.
- Come on!
- I got all kinds of muffins!
Blueberry muffins, poppy seed muffins, banana nut muffins, chocolate chip Ooh, wait, there are no muffins.
What's happening now?
How's it feel being lied to, Huh?
I mean, I'm okay.
I wasn't really that invested - in the muffins.
- I was.
You guys thought you could keep a secret from me?
Well, I know everything.
Hitchcock left his phone in the bathroom again, and guess what I found on it.
I needed the cash.
I didn't know they'd be filming.
Text chains.
Dozens of text chains.
And I'm not on any of them.
Take a look at this board.
There's an Amy-Gina-Terry- Hitchcock-Rosa-Jake chain.
There's a Hitchcock-Terry- Amy-Rosa Chain.
There's even a Hitchcock-Gina- Scully chain.
I mean, what the hell happens on that?
Well, we mostly just exchange "Game of Thrones" theories.
The little guy is gonna marry a dragon.
We think.
Well, one thing's for sure: Charles Boyle is off the chains.
I'm sorry.
We only excluded you because you're kind of an over-texter.
Over-texter?
That's not even a thing.
Oh really?
So you don't remember the time you sent 97 unanswered texts in a five-minute span?
My phone vibrated itself off the desk.
I think it was committing suicide.
It's okay.
This isn't the first time I've been left out.
At camp, nobody would be friends with me.
I had to hang out with the lunch ladies.
After summer ended, they never replied to any of my letters.
Oh, this is really sad.
There's just no muffins at all.
- Kaboom!
- What's this?
That is the art auction that George Judy will be robbing tonight.
- Why is it so sticky?
- I was eating sour straws.
It's crazy that's what you're choosing to focus on.
Doug Judy came through for us.
That's what George is after: a bejeweled egg worth $20 million.
That's a nice egg, but how do you know he'll be there?
Doug's boy Parker said he kept asking about the place.
And what does this Parker do?
You know, I don't know.
I can't really recall.
Some sort of auto-industry professional.
Maybe, like, a car thief or some such whatnot.
Oh, I see.
So the only thing we have to go on is the word of one of your criminal friends?
Criminals?
That's how you see us?
Is it a crime to steal bread to feed your family?
Or to sell some weed so you can buy video games?
Or to steal video games because you smoked all that weed - you were supposed to sell?
- Yes, all of those are crimes.
- Damn.
Even the bread one?
- Especially the bread one.
But since this is the only lead you have, go do something with it.
Oh, we'll go do something with it.
We'll go do something with the hell out of it.
Woop-woop that's the sound of da police Woop-woop that's the sound of da beast Woop-woop that's the sound of da police No, no, no.
He's not a cop.
He can't be wearing any of this.
It's just a windbreaker.
It's not like I gave him a badge and a gun.
- Uh, he has both of those things.
- It's not loaded.
I just want to cock it and say a cool cop catch phrase.
New York's finest just got a whole lot finer.
- Give me that.
-  I'm putting myself on this case.
All right, Captain.
Looks like New York's finest just got a whole lot - Let's go!
- All right.
Woop-woop that's the sound of da police Whoo.
Okay.
How do I look?
Like I'm about to buy a bunch of expensive art?
Hell, yeah.
And not just paintings either.
You look statue rich.
I didn't know we'd have to valet.
Perhaps I shouldn't have brought Gertie.
- Who's Gertie?
-  That foxy little she-devil we just drove here in.
Gertie?
No, man.
A car's gotta have a sexy name, like Brooke, or Tiffany, or Sandra, or Candice.
Yeah, or Suzie, or Dana, or Karen.
Oh, no, wait.
That's my mom's name.
- Why did I say my mom's name?
- Ugh.
The sight of another man inside her makes me sick.
Yeah.
I dislike this conversation very much.
Treat her gently!
You know that's not a nice car, right?
Say that again.
Damn, Cap.
Be cool.
Say that again.
That's what I thought.
I'll be in the venue.
- Come on, Boyle.
- What's this about?
Look, if you're leading me to some sort of big surprise apology where everyone's there and you all want me to join your stupid text chains, I am 100% in.
These last 24 hours have just been hell.
Oh, it's just my former lover.
Hello, sister.
Ugh, I hate when you say those things back-to-back.
- Here.
- You took my phone?
Yeah.
I had to delete your GIF keyboard and your three "Property Brothers" emoji apps.
Wait.
Did you delete them because Yeah.
You're on the office text chain.
Are you serious?
This is amazing.
Yeah, well I was totally against it, but Amy felt bad because you seemed so pathetic.
- Don't say that.
- It worked!
I mean, your little camp story.
Was the saddest childhood memory I've ever heard, and I've listened to Amy talking about attending "the crossing guard's jamboree".
That was fun!
We were directing traffic in the hotel hallways.
People were freaking out.
Mm-hmm.
Just don't make us regret this.
I won't.
I swear I won't.
I gotta tell my dad.
I know you weren't on board with this, but look how happy we made him.
And at no cost to our  oh.
- And here it comes.
- No.
That was just one  uh-oh.
I bet he's just getting it - out of his system.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm sure he'll be brief.
Apparently the Tsar of Russia gave that bejeweled egg to his girlfriend as a present.
I've never gotten a bejeweled anything.
Stupid Amy.
Well, I highly doubt our murderer is gonna show up here.
Doug Judy said he's be here, and I believe him.
Cap, got some hors d'oeuvres.
I don't know what you like, so I guessed: the radishes they put on the side for decoration?
Mmm, thank you.
Cut into a flower?
Where are we, Las Vegas?
Guys, look over there by the hallway.
See the woman in the red?
I think that's my brother's girlfriend, Fran.
I don't want her to recognize me.
Does she have a scar on her left cheek?
Maybe.
What's the shape of the scar?
- Just a general slash shape.
- Oh, darn.
I've been reading a lot of "Harry Potter" lately, and I was hoping for something more fun.
Okay, I'll head towards her.
You go around back in case she makes a break for it.
She's on the move.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Oh.
- No, please stop.
- Freeze.
NYPD.
- What's going on?
- No scar.
It's not Fran.
Then why was she running?
Because a strange guy started following me to the bathroom.
Right.
Because men are horrible and the world is a nightmare.
Yeah.
- Oh, no.
Where's Doug Judy?
- Where we left him.
Why?
Scarface Fran is a ruse.
He wanted us out of there so he can help his brother steal the egg!
Check it out.
Shot glasses of soup.
Oh, you wondering how I got the whole tray?
Charmed it right out of her hands You want some soup?
- This where you been all day?
- Yep.
Just looking for clues.
Trying to see how George Judy escaped.
- You're pretty sweaty.
- Terry runs hot.
Terry runs hot.
You're trying to see if you can do that wall climb, - aren't you?
- Yeah.
And I can't.
I'm old.
Because you can't parkour up a wall?
It's everything.
The TV's always too quiet.
I don't like how baggy basketball shorts are.
I even shook my fist at some skateboarders the other day.
- Oof.
- And there's something worse.
Way, way worse.
Terry needs reading glasses.
- It's not that bad, Sarge.
- Yes, it is!
I used to be "Batman".
Now I'm his dad.
His dumb, weak, getting shot at the opera dad.
Okay, auction over.
I can't believe you thought Doug Judy was tricking us so he could steal the egg.
If anyone was stealing any eggs, it was you 'cause you have egg all over your face.
Is that why you've been so quiet these last four minutes?
- You had to think of that?
- Mm-hmm.
Was it worth it?
- Hell, yeah.
- Ah, venomous burn.
-  - Suck out the poison.
Wow.
He may not have been pulling something back there, but both of you were wrong about George Judy.
He never showed.
We wasted a day, and if anyone has egg on their faces, it's you two.
Doug Egg and Egg Peralta.
That's actually kind of a dope name.
What's going on out there?
Hey, Jake Peralta, NYPD.
What happened here?
Somebody knocked out the valet, stole all the cars.
- Every single one.
- So George was here.
He wasn't after the egg, he was after the cars.
Well, looks like Doug Judy was right after all, huh, Captain?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Is it because you're so embarrassed for being wrong?
Gertie!
What a big bomb, the Captain's car is gone Shut up!
Shut up!
I don't get it.
Why would George Judy steal all these cars and not the egg?
Easier to sell if you're in a hurry.
Plus these are some valuable vehicles.
- Bugatti, Ferrari - Gertie.
I don't think Gertie was a prime target, sir.
Do you know how much custom work there was on her?
I disabled the FM function from the radio.
The guy said, "Oh, you can just not use it," but I said, "Ugh, I'll always know it's there".
Boom.
Shelby Cobra 427SC.
That's a million dollars on four wheels, baby.
That's what George is after.
How do we even know George did it?
I mean, nobody saw him.
But there was a prolific car thief at the scene of the crime.
You talking about me?
I'm a cop now.
- No, you're not.
- Then why do I have a badge and a gun?
The thin blue line just got thick as hell.
- Give me that!
- Come on, Judy.
It's not loaded.
Look, if I was gonna jack a bunch of cars, I would bring two of New York's best detectives with me to the scene of the crime.
- Aww, you think we're the best?
- Flattery won't work on us.
- What?
- This is nonsense.
- You're off the case.
- Whoa, whoa, sir.
Come on.
We're chasing a murderer.
A murderer that just stole a ton of cars.
Who knows more about that world than Doug Judy?
Plus remember, he doesn't get immunity unless he helps us bring his brother in.
I know, but Do you want to get back Gertie or not?
- Fine.
He's still on the case.
- Ah!
The Pontiac Bandit and Jake are cops With their wise-cracking Captain along for the ride They'll have adventures wherever they go The talking dog flies in outer space Arf, arf, arf, fly, fly, fly, fly dog - Arf, arf, arf -  Fly, fly, fly, fly dog Arf, arf, arf, fly, fly, fly, fly dog Okay, Charles, I was you on this text chain.
I really do, but since you joined yesterday, you have sent 71 texts.
The rest of the group collectively has sent two.
You know, honestly, I'd rather get hit by a bus than get one more text from you, Charles.
Fine.
I've been kicked out of things before.
At camp, I found a slam book that the lunch ladies had written about me.
I'm sorry, Charles, but there is no story sad enough to save you now.
Challenge accepted.
Once, as a tween, I got my penis entirely Okay, stop!
No, no, no, no, no.
Our plan was just to teach you to text better.
You know, a lot of people like the way I text.
Look, if you can't accept me for who I am, - then I don't need this chain.
- Okay, great.
No, no, no, I need to be included so badly.
I'll do whatever you say.
I literally have zero pride.
And that's what I like to hear.
Oh, Charles.
Okay, so you guys are rich Europeans looking to buy a Shelby.
I'll make the introductions.
Wait, we can't just be Europeans.
- What country are we from?
- What languages do you speak?
French, Spanish, some Portuguese.
Obviously Greek, enough Flemish to get by.
Tight.
What about you, Peralta?
Um, I can do a pretty good Italian accent.
"You think you could milk me"?
So you're just doing De Niro from "Meet the Parents"?
I don't know, am I?
- That's a terrible De Niro.
- I don't know.
- This is De Niro.
- I think it's pretty good.
- Mine's better.
- It's pretty good.
- We'll just make you American.
- Okay.
- Griff.
- Hey, Doug Judy.
- Hey.
- What can I do for you?
Hey, did my brother stop by?
I heard he jacked some nice cars, and I might have a buyer.
This is Maxime Dubois, international millionaire.
- Bonjour.
- He doesn't speak any English.
This is his lawyer, Carl Mangerson.
Hey, I'm a lawyer.
Maxine wants to buy a Shelby Cobra.
I hear George might have one.
He just dropped off a few cars, but he didn't say anything about no Cobra.
I mostly deal with scrap and crap, you know?
Son of a bitch.
Hey, hey, is everything all right here, Maxime?
You're speaking good English.
Eh, just a few phrases he picked up from movies and such.
He's disappointed.
He really wanted that Cobra.
You know the French, so passionate, even their skunks.
PepÃ© Le Pew.
It doesn't matter; I'm a lawyer.
No further comments.
Do you know where George is?
Maybe I can do business with him myself.
-  Gertie!
- What?
Uh, that was French for   "I gotta make a phone call".
He's gotta make a phone call.
Frenchmens  You can't bring them anywhere.
So if George went over that wall, he would have been caught on a security camera across - Whatcha eating there, Sarge?
- Cream of Wheat.
It's easy to chew, and it keeps you regular.
It's a favorite dish of the elderly.
Stop freaking out about this.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
"I'm young at heart".
No, you are super old at heart.
You always have been.
You love yogurt.
You volunteer at your polling place.
You refuse to deposit your checks at an ATM.
It's a machine.
I don't trust it.
I get what you're saying, but at least I used to be a prime physical specimen.
Dude, you have, like, 1% body fat.
Now I'm at 1.8.
I'm fat.
I'm a fat, bald old man.
- You shave your head.
- Yeah, Rosa.
Vin Diesel and I shave our heads because we think it looks good.
Okay, you obviously want to sit here feeling sorry for yourself, but we have work to do.
So, I don't know, why don't I get you a wheelchair - and a box of diapers.
- The wheelchair!
That's how he escaped.
He dressed up like an old lady.
That orderly is pushing him out.
He did have an accomplice.
I'm gonna find this bastard.
I don't need this anymore.
I should take my jacket, though.
I mean, it's January.
I ain't crazy.
Oh, Gertie.
Psst.
George is here.
- He's out back.
- Let's go.
Right now.
NYPD, don't move!
Crap, he's getting away!
-  - All right.
We can run right through it.
These suits are fire-resistant.
These suits are not fire-resistant.
They're not?
Then why are they so expensive?
-  - Bye, Peralta.
No!
Judy!
Both Judys!
Judys!
Oh, I can't believe this!
I really thought I could trust Doug Judy this time.
I kept telling you not to, but you wouldn't listen.
You were too busy singing your songs and planning trips to Niagara Falls.
We just said neither of us had ever been.
There were no hard plans.
Look, it's humiliating.
Doug Judy thought he could manipulate me, and he could.
I feel like I'm a terrible cop.
Wow, I really thought you were going to chime in with something supportive there.
We have to go.
Captain?
Okay, Charles.
This is your final exam.
We're gonna show you a text and then two potential responses.
You need to tell us which is more appropriate.
Amy writes, "Leaving the virgin festival" - Gina - "Be there in ten minutes".
Do you reply, "I'll be counting down the seconds.
"600, 599, 598, JK, LOL, "597, 596, smiley face, smiley face, cat smiley, thumbs up".
Or, "Okay".
It's a trick question.
The text requires no response.
Charles Boyle, welcome back to the Nine-Nine text chain.
Yes!
We should call it the Nine-Nine party line - I'll rename the thread.
- Charles.
Sorry.
I'll be better.
I'll be better.
There's the car.
How'd you know they'd be here?
Detective's intuition.
Okay, fine.
We went to Dave and Buster's together and got separated, so we turned on Find My Friends.
The stairs are in the back.
Looking for us?
Put your guns down, turn around slowly.
What the hell, Judy?
I thought we were friends.
I don't know why you thought that.
'Cause you kept saying we were.
We had hard plans to go to Niagara Falls.
So, bro, you friends with this cop?
Nah.
This thirsty-ass bitch is just desperate for attention.
Thirsty-ass bitch?
Okay, Captain, now I know you're going to step in and defend me.
Well, you were begging me to compliment you earlier.
Oh, my God.
This is the worst day of my life.
- Where's Charles?
- So, if you're not friends, you won't mind if I waste him, right?
Of course he minds.
I mean, sure, we're enemies, but in, like, a playful way, like Tom and Jerry.
Oh, my God.
Was Tom trying to eat Jerry?
- My whole life is a lie.
- Shoot him.
No, no, no.
Those can't be my last words.
Uh, ay caramba.
-  - What the hell?
Whoops.
Looks like somebody forgot to put bullets - in his brother's gun.
- Aha!
I knew you didn't betray me.
I said that accusatorily, but I'm very happy.
Doug Judy and Peralta and Captain on the case Joke's on you, they was always friends Now I'ma get my immunity The ghost of the talking dog haunts the precinct - The talking dog died.
- Aww, man.
I know; it was a bummer note to end on.
- You got our orderly.
- Turns out he really didn't work at the hospital, but he left his print behind in the room where he stole the scrubs.
It didn't take long to track him down.
Whoa.
With that and the wheelchair, that's some pretty nice police work, Sarge.
I know.
You know, my muscles might not be as strong as when I was young, but one's stronger: my big, beefy brain.
Now if you will excuse me, I have to process David Willis.
Aww, you got a little necklace for your glasses.
I had to.
I almost lost them last night during "Wheel".
Hey, Rosa.
Have a hard candy.
Terry is embracing his age.
I just got off the phone with the DA.
And for aiding in the capture of George Judy, you have officially been granted immunity from all your past crimes.
- So I'm a free man?
- Mm.
Nope, still smells the same.
I'm sorry that I doubted you, but you did drive off with the guy that we were chasing.
Had to.
I saw he was about to get away, so I tricked him into thinking I was on his side.
It's crazy how good I am at your job.
Look, I owe you both an apology.
Doug Judy, I underestimated your honesty.
And, Peralta, I underestimated your instincts.
Yeah, I'm gonna need a lot more from you than that.
Fine.
You're a good cop even if you are a thirst-ass bitch.
Wow.
Okay.
Solved a pretty intense murder, and just crap all over me.
Hey, Captain, got you a little something-something.
- Gertie?
- Nope.
But she is the exact same make, model, and color.
Oh, my God, you stole this.
- I can't be driving a stolen - Relax, man.
I bought it at a used car lot for, like, $600.
- This is not a nice vehicle.
- Yeah, it's not.
And by the way, her name's not Gertie.
It's Sexarella.
Hello, Sexarella.
So, what's next for you, Doug Judy?
I'm turning over a new leaf.
Gonna live that honest life.
Maybe open up a bakery, buy a little house, invest in my retirement.
You're gonna go back to stealing cars immediately, - aren't you?
- That's very much on the table.
- Yeah.
- And when you do - I'll be there to stop you.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- I'm gonna miss you, brother.
- Good-bye, little Fievel.
Good-bye, Papa.
- Cool.
All right, peace out.
- Uh-huh.
- It was good to see you.
- Good to see you, man.
Hey, you guys, I thought of a funny response to Terry's text from earlier.
Would you mind taking a look before I hit send?
Charles, you've trained for this moment, okay?
We trust you.
Just send it.
Come here.
Good job.
- All right, I'm gonna do it.
- Mm-hmm.
Way to go, Cha

I've been asked to read this statement.
"Two months ago, Gina Linetti was hit by a bus, "and the brightest star in the cosmos was extinguished.
"But today, like a phoenix from the ashes, she rises to vanquish" This is ten pages.
I can't read it.

Here she is.
Thank you.
As much pain as I've been in, I can't imagine what it's been like for you living in a Gina-less world for two months.
I'll field some questions now.
Anyone?
Uh, how long do you have to wear the the  Metal the head holder It's called a halo.
The doctor said I have to wear it for another week.
It's drilled into my skull here.
And, yes, I can still hear the screws squeaking into the bone.
So what was it like getting hit by a bus?
- It was awesome.
- Ah, I knew it.
I always wanted to get hit by a bus.
Yeah, I mean, I was legally dead for two full minutes.
- And I met God.
- Tight.
- What does she look like?
- Ethnically ambiguous.
You took two weeks off when Kourtney and Scott Disick broke up.
Are you sure you're ready to be back at work now?
What are you saying, Terry?
You think I can't handle being back yet?
Watch this.
Gina Linetti is back, baby!
Sorry I'm late.
I was on a call with One Police Plaza.
Apparently crime in Brooklyn is down significantly.
-  - Which means they'll be permanently closing one precinct.
- What?
- We celebrated too soon.
An auditor will arrive shortly.
He'll evaluate us on crime stats, physical plant, fiscal responsibility.
There are 22 other precincts in Brooklyn, so we just don't want to rate at the bottom.
Are they gonna be looking in our desks?
Also, unrelated someone left a bunch of swords in my desk.
I have a similar question about browser histories.
- Just throw your computer away.
- Roger that.
The auditor will start by joining Peralta and Santiago on their gang stakeout because They're America's dream couple.
You need to calm down.
We're in a workplace.
Because their case is a good example of the type of serious crime that still exists in our neighborhood.
So Oh.
Looks like the auditor is here.
Isn't that Teddy - Amy's ex-boyfriend?
- Yep.
Jake, didn't you break them up?
Yep.
Amy, didn't you tell him to his face he was the most boring man alive?
- Yep.
- This is gonna be awkward.
-  Yep.
- We had a good run.
Let's not panic just yet.
Maybe he doesn't remember us ruining his life and stomping all over his heart.
-  - Hey, everyone.
I'm Sergeant Wells.
Jake, Amy, nice to see you.
Teddy, nice to see you, too.
Excited to have you in the field with us.
Good.
I just hope I don't bore you to death.
Ah, what?
Yeah.
What's that?
The crime phone is ringing?
We have to answer it.
Come on, Amy.
BRB.
Okay.
Why'd you have to say he was boring?
Because he is boring.
His favorite app on his phone is "contacts".
He's gonna shut this place down, and we're gonna get shipped off to separate precincts.
I don't think our relationship can survive that.
I mean, even if we don't work together, we can still be a couple.
If I don't see you every day, I will forget who you are.
I'm like a goldfish.
Standing in the briefing room a space that is approximately 50 feet by 40 feet.
Actually, you know what?
55 feet by 40 feet.
No, 52 feet by 41 feet.
I'll just look at the blueprints at the City Planner's office.
Hello, weekend plans.
Sergeant Wells, have you been to other precincts yet?
How'd they do?
Well, you know, everyone's got their issues.
That's too bad.
I want all my brothers in the NYPD to do perfectly.
The Seven-Four is corrupt.
You didn't hear it from me.
You know what?
We're just looking to eliminate waste.
I assure you, you'll find zero waste here.
Really?
Because I did notice during my preliminary examination that you recently purchased a $21,000 copy machine?
Well, that machine saves money in terms of man-hours.
Uh, if you excuse me, Sergeant Wells, we need to go to the BRB.
It's BRB time.
We're BRB-ing.
- Make space.
- You make space!
This closet is for people who are freaking out.
Oh, I'm fully freaking out.
I just experimented with an unfamiliar acronym in public.
- BRB what does it even mean?
- Be right back.
It has the same number of syllables as the acronym.
- What's the point?
-  Teddy knows about the fancy Japanese copier that C.J. bought the one that broke the first time we used it.
Is it supposed to do that?
It was not supposed to do that.
Is this where people are freaking out?
Because we are freaking out.
Teddy dinged the One-Five for having roaches.
So what?
We don't have roaches.
Our rats ate all of them.
That's the problem.
We have rats.
Right, right, right, right, that's worse.
Oh, God, they're gonna shut this precinct down Riand separate me and Jake.
that's worse.
Our friendship is over.
If he doesn't see my face every day, he'll forget who I am.
He's like a goldfish.
This is all your fault.
You just had to sleep with Teddy, didn't you?
You couldn't keep it in your pants.
- Come on, Charles.
- He's right, Santiago.
Your libido has endangered us all.
-  - Excuse me, guys, coming in.
Wait.
Gina, you sure you can fit in?
I'm sorry.
Because of my injury, I can no longer fit in?
No, I meant physically.
I'll have you know, I am physically as strong as I've ever been stronger even.
I'm Gina Linetti, and I can do anything, okay?
Excuse me, please.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah, this is too crowded.
Shouldn't have wasted my speech on this moment.
To the evidence room.
You two need to figure out how to patch things up with Teddy.
He's still upset that I called him boring.
We just have to pretend that he's interesting.
I got pretty good at it while we were dating.
We just have to smile and nod and agree with whatever he said last.
Great.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm still not sure who the second-best "Die Hard" villain is, though, you know?
Probably Jeremy Irons.
But maybe it's Timothy Olyphant, or it could be William Atherton.
- Definitely the last one.
- Right?
No, I really think it's William Atherton.
Okay.
We have to engage him on topics that he cares about.
Pilsners he loves talking about pilsners.
Oh, my God.
Just saying the word gives me PTSD.
Pilsner-TSD.
- Good one.
- Thanks.
Pull yourself together and go out there and make Teddy feel like he's the most interesting man on Earth.
I want him to think he's Andy Borowitz likwhen this is all done.
sting manOn it.
rth.
We'll go there and make him feel like whoever that person is.
Let's go.
Okay, now what we need to do is fix that infernal copier.
Jeffords, you did a year abroad in Tokyo.
Maybe you can figure out the manual.
It's in Japanese.
I can try, but the only thing I really remember how to say is, "Do you have a bigger door I can enter through"?
Bring me solutions, not problems.
Now, what do we do about the rats?
Well, lucky for us, I have recently come into a lot of wolf urine.
That's lucky for us how?
It creates a scent impression that there are predators nearby.
I've been dousing Nikolaj's shoes with it to scare off bullies at his preschool.
- Did it work?
- No, now they call him pee boy.
He's much worse off.
But wolf urine definitely scares off rats.
We can use it to herd them toward the traps.
What about me?
Like, what should I do?
I just thought maybe you could take it easy.
- It's your first day and - I'll have you know, I am as strong physically as I have ever been - stronger even.
- You already did this.
Yeah, I have short-term amnesia.
I got hit by a bus.
But don't worry.
I am as strong physically as I have ever been stronger even.
Fine.
You can help me with the copier.
Detectives have chosen an adequate location for their stakeout.
Teddy, how's it going, my man?
Nice to see you.
I'm glad we get to spend this time together.
- I haven't seen you since - You broke me and Amy up.
Maybe.
Probably not.
Who can say when people last saw people?
Anyway, that's the HQ for the 8th Street Killas.
We think they're meeting up with leaders of another gang to possibly merge organizations.
Detectives demonstrate a passable knowledge of their operation.
Cool.
So, hey, we might be here for a while.
- Can I offer you a beverage?
- Ooh.
Diet ginger ale that is my favorite.
Actually, I shouldn't.
It'll make me all hyper.
Suit yourself.
Too bad we're on the job, right?
Could've stocked that thing with pilsners.
- You like pilsners?
- Are you kidding me?
I kills for the pils.
I'm a total pils-nerd.
What's your poison German or Bohemian?
- The last one that you said.
- Good choice.
The last one always is.
Wow.
This is fun.
I could talk with you about pilsners all day.
Oh, let's do it.
Of the Bohemians, what's your fave?
Scharfen grelderbrau.
It's new.
Millennials love it.
Cool.
Let me make note of that.
Just caught Detectives S and P in a bald-faced lie.
You don't like pilsners.
You hate pilsners.
You think they're boring, and you still think I'm boring.
No.
No lie.
Detectives S and P didn't lie.
Detectives S and P no lie.
Sargent, please tell me this malfunctioning copier isn't gonna sink our precinct.
I figured out how to turn it on, but the screen just shows a cartoon turtle sobbing.
Perhaps it's a paper jam.
And what about when the little sushi roll comes out and cuts the turtle's head off?
- Toner issue.
- Why?
Anyway, I started taking it apart, but it's been a slow process for some reason.
Hey, Captain, I'm glad you're here to see this.
I'm just about to drink my tea.
Terry.
Can't even tell I was hit by a bus.
That's how independent I am.
Well, perhaps Boyle and Diaz have made more progress with the rats.
We've made absolutely no progress.
It took forever to bait the traps because Scully kept eating the peanut butter out of them.
You can't prove it was me, Rosa.
Now we're gonna use the wolf urine to flush the rats out of the walls and into our traps.
That's where I come in.
I'm going up in the ceiling.
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Mobility.
It's a good thing I still have my sexy-cat costume from Halloween.
I really don't think you were the target audience for that item.
There is nothing gendered about a sexy cat.
Now, please hand me that big jug wolf pee I rub on my kid.
Okay, Teddy, let's not evaluate rashly here, all right?
It's a misunderstanding.
We're not saying pilsners are boring.
We're saying that we are too boring to appreciate them properly - is what I'm going with.
- Jake, I agree with you.
Pilsners are boring.
That's why I don't drink them anymore.
- Say what now?
- Amy was right.
When we were going together, I was boring.
It took our breakup for me to realize that.
So you're not still mad at me?
No, no, no, you changed me.
I found my wild side.
My girlfriend and I do 5Ks now.
We took a two-week trip to San Diego last year.
The energy of that place is electric.
But back at the precinct, you said, "I hope I don't bore you to death".
That was a joke.
Humor is the tool of the interesting.
Right.
A tool that you have clearly mastered.
Ooh, get this my lady turned me on to something called adult coloring books, - which we do at wait for it -  Jazz brunches.
What?
Aha.
Wow.
It's like brunch is crazy enough on its own, then you throw jazz in the mix.
it's like, "Why are we even doing this"?
Oh, my God, that is This is fun.
I have not laughed this much in a long time.
Twice.
Reminder invite Jake and Amy to jazz brunch tomorrow.
Uh, reminder we're in.
Good.
But I am actually gonna email you the invite, if you could just RSVP to that.
I'd feel better if everyone had it on their calendars.
Copy that.
We all have calendars.
So that'll work out great, 'cause we all have one.
How's it going with the copier?
Not great.
I got through to customer service, but I really don't remember that much Japanese.
Hey, Captain.
Update on the rat situation.
Wolf pee's in place, and the traps are set in the evidence room.
I thought we were luring them into the break room.
No, Gina needed it for meditation.
You are strong.
You are wise.
You will have your revenge on all New York City buses.
- Everything else is good?
- Not quite.
We have a Charles situation.
Well, how stuck are you, Boyle?
Completely.
My tail seems to have gotten knotted around a sprinkler.
I think I can pull it.
No, that might break the pipe.
The last thing we need is a flood.
That's okay.
I'm sure you'll have me down in no time.
Incorrect.
That would make a hole in the ceiling.
You're there till Monday.
We'll bring you some food in a bucket.
Sir, I really think He'll be fine.
Guava juice, mango juice, orange juice, of course, grapefruit juice, and cranberry juice.
Jazz brunch sounds insane.
But should we talk about how efficient and well run the Nine-Nine is for a while?
We got plenty of time for that.
I'm gonna hit the little boys' room.
When I get back, remind me to tell you all about the omelet-bar station.
- We will.
- You bet.
Spoiler alert two kinds of bell pepper.
-  - Oh, my God, he's so boring.
- He's so boring.
- Most boring man in America.
And that's him trying to be interesting.
That is Spring Break Teddy.
- How did you ever date him?
-  Oh, no, he has a really big wiener, doesn't he?
Wait.
Don't tell me if that's true, unless it's not.
No, but then if you don't say anything, I'll know that it is.
Oh, why aren't you saying anything about his wiener, Amy?
- Jake.
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I don't want to hear about your ex's wiener.
Just you're not making me feel better.
- Why would you do this to me?
- Jake, stop spiraling.
Every time you shake me, I see it flopping around.
Stop.
Oh, look, there's our gang leader.
- Seriously?
-  Wow.
Perfect timing, successful stakeout.
There's no way that Sergeant Boring Big Wiener will shut us down now.
- Shh.
I think I hear Teddy.
- You didn't answer.
Forgot the old phonester.
I like to go through my contacts while I go pee.
So you only need to use one hand that's great.
Oh, look, it was still recording.
Like, recording recording?
- Yeah.
-  - Oh, this is bad.
- What?
What's wrong?
Oh, my God.
It was recording the whole time.
We said all that bad stuff.
Sorry.
I was so preoccupied with the wiener stuff.
Oh, this is bad.
But while I have you, just stop me.
I know accepting Teddy's jazz-brunch invite was the only way to get his phone back and save the Nine-Nine, but this place is literally hell.
Eggs Benedict in a lickety split She's doing jazz about brunch.
Maybe it's not too late to get out of here.
We could start a new life in the country, maybe open a small bookstore.
How dare you tempt me with a small bookstore?
- We need to focus.
- Okay.
Look, Teddy's over there.
Oh, and he's in fun, casual wear.
His phone is out on the table, like it always is, because he fears the radiation will affect his testicles.
Which are connected to his average-sized - Jake.
- Right.
It's misshapen.
That's all that matters.
All right, here's the plan We stage a fight.
It escalates, and I flip over the table in dramatic fashion.
Do we need the table flip?
Amy, when the opportunity presents itself to flip-a da table, uh, you flip-a da table.
And in the chaos, you grab his phone, delete the recording, and we're golden.
Perfect.
All right, let's stage a fake fight.
This'll be fun, right?
Pretending like we have things to be mad at each other about.
Jake's chronic tardiness, his slobbiness, and the fact that he wasted half the morning deciding what sneakers to wear those are just some of the reasons we're late.
No one cares about your sneakers, Jake.
Yeah, very convincing.
We're just glad you guys made it.
This is Rachel, my girlfriend.
Hi.
So Teddy said you guys had such a blast - at the stakeout.
- Yes, it was incredible.
Can I really quickly just say the real reason we were late was that Amy insisted on brushing her teeth for 30 minutes?
Two minutes or one minute, 58 seconds longer than you did.
Anyway, can we please st talk to our friends?
- Wow.
Fine.
- Fine.
- So, Rachel - Hmm?
- How did you guys meet?
- Oh.
Such a wild story.
So I was on an elevator and so was Teddy.
- Oh, that's the whole story.
- I think it's romantic.
I remember when our relationship had magic moments like that before it went stale.
- Stale?
- Mm.
Okay, you want some action, Jackson?
Well, how about I make a scene?
-  - Whoa.
- What are you doing?
- Flip-a-ing de table.
It's bolted down.
Oh, what a shock.
You tried something and failed.
Okay, you know what?
That's it.
I'm gonna slide it right off!
I am so sorry.
I got carried away.
I will now clean this up entirely by myself.
- No - No, please keep your eyes on me as I make this sincere apology.
I am sorry.
It's okay.
Something crazy always happens at jazz brunch.
It's the Wild West.
Oh, man, Teddy, look what happened.
Your phone landed directly in this glass of OJ.
That seems almost impossible.
"Almost" being the key word, but it happened for real, and we all know it.
There you go.
That's it.
You've gone too far.
I am storming off now.
No, you've gone too far, and I'm storming off now!
There's something I'd like to show you, Captain.
Terry crushed it.
- It works!
-  I've never been more proud of you for anything in your life.
I mean, I've solved a lot of cases for you.
And yet crime has continued.
I think we've done it, Captain.
Just heard the traps go off.
Want to come check with us?
- Of course.
How's Boyle doing?
- He's fine.
You know how quickly he submits to his environment.
Where are the rats?
There's blood everywhere.
This is a horror scene.
They must've chewed themselves free.
Detective Diaz, what was in that box?
It's from a closed case in 1986, when they busted the guy that dealt to the New York Mets.
My God, those rats have eaten the purest cocaine in the history of this city.
They know no fear or pain.
And look!
They're back in the walls.
Boyle!
Ah!
The rats chewed through the sprinkler pipe.
They're coked up.
Get out of there.
They think I'm a cat.
Boyle, be careful of the ceiling.
Submit to them!
Tell Jake I never panicked.
Aah!
- My copier!
- My precinct!
Charles!
Charles?
- Aah!
They survived the fall!
-  Run!
That was fun.
We're really good at fake fighting.
And you were amazing at coming up with all that stuff to be mad about.
Yep, totally, I just said all that stuff to save the precinct, and that's all.
Oh, my God.
You don't actually care about my sneakers.
No!
I care about them deeply.
They're all so different.
Okay.
Hey, guys, it's Teddy from jazz brunch.
Hey, Teddy.
It's Teddy from jazz brunch.
- Why is he here?
- I don't know.
But the fake fight's back on.
So shut it, you bigmouthed bitch and your stupid sneakers!
If you don't like my shoes, you can just tell me.
Hi.
Can I talk to you guys about something?
Actually, Teddy, this is not a good time.
We're still having a pretty big fight.
Well, I think what I'm about to say may solve things.
y, I'm still in love with you.
What?
- What?
- What?
Uh-oh.
Okay, okay, everybody just calm down and take a deep breath.
What the hell is going on, man?
Yeah, what the hell is going on?
- You've got a girlfriend.
- I know.
- And she's fine.
- Thanks.
Sorry.
I was really planning on you being in the cab during this.
Okay, that wouldn't make it better.
- No.
- Amy, I'm just I'm not over you yet, and I would've never said anything, because I thought you and Jake were happy, but after seeing you at jazz brunch, - I think I might've been wrong.
- Don't read into that.
That was a freak argument.
We are very happy.
Amy, we have all the same interests.
We have so much chemistry.
When we're together, it's like, no matter where we are, it's San Diego.
I feel compelled to tell you that San Diego's terrible.
I'm gonna lay it all on the line.
Amy Santiago will you marry me?
-  What?
- What?
Okay, really, could you stay in the cab?
I'm sorry.
I'll be right there.
I promise.
maybe I won't.
What's your answer?
Teddy, I don't want to be with you.
But you want to be with him?
You guys have nothing in common.
Oh, yeah?
Tell that to William Atherton the man we both consider to be the second-best "Die Hard" villain.
She meant it.
And also, yes, we are different people, but I love that about us.
I love that Jake's a little messy and that he cares so much about his dumb sneakers and he doesn't get stressed out about calendars.
- Or flossing my teeth.
- No, the non-flossing is crazy.
Copy that, and I love you.
I'm just so confused.
Your fight was like something out of a movie.
- Teddy - No.
I have to tell you the truth.
No.
Amy is dying.
She has one month to live.
Marrying her would be a waste of time.
Jake and I were only pretending to fight so that we could destroy your phone.
While we were on the stakeout and you were in the bathroom, we said you were the most boring man in America, and your phone recorded it.
I'm sorry.
We didn't want you to get mad at us and fail the precinct.
Wow.
You guys are the worst.
Well, you just proposed in front of your girlfriend, so potato, po-tah-to.
Amy, I loved you.
All right, I'm ready to go, Rachel.
Should we hit up the Tenement Museum?
No!
I talked to NYPD facilities to see if they could get an emergency cleanup crew out to us this afternoon.
I received their standard response.
This is on you, Boyle.
You couldn't just suck it up and let a few dozen crazed rats eat you until their hearts exploded?
Don't blame Boyle.
The rats only got into the cocaine because you put the traps in the evidence room.
We were gonna use the break room, but Gina was in there, and she got hit by a damn bus, so nobody can say no to her.
That's it.
Nobody can say no to her.
Answer's still no.
Right, but maybe you should speak to my colleague first.
Hi.
I got hit by a bus.
Wow.
This place looks amazing.
Yes, thanks to Gina.
She's responsible for all of it.
She's an inspiration.
Thank you, Captain.
You have permission to share my story.
So how'd it go with Sergeant Wells?
Let's see.
He proposed to Amy.
She said no, and then his girlfriend dumped him.
- Terry's getting nervous.
- It's worse than it sounds.
There was a jazz brunch involved.
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.
Look, all we can do is hope that Sergeant Wells handles this like a professional and respects the uniform that we all wear.
Hey, everybody, look who's here.
It's me, the most boring man in America.
Well, to be the most anything in America is pretty good.
I mean, it's a big country.
- Teddy, we are so sorry.
- No, you don't have to be.
It's okay.
I get it.
I am boring.
I'm owning it now.
Sergeant Wells, I understand that you're upset for personal reasons, but we're hoping that you'll give us a fair evaluation.
I will not 'cause I'm not gonna write one at all.
I'm recusing myself.
Oh.
That is so sweet.
Thank you for being such a good guy, Teddy.
Okay.
I can read between the lines, and I love you, too.
Amy Santiago, will you - No!
Get up!
- Come on!
Well, for what it's worth, your precinct is immaculate.
I'm sure that your new auditor, Lieutenant Hopkins, will be very impressed.
- Veronica Hopkins?
- That's the one.
Well, the good news is, Amy has not dated her.
No, but I did, and she hates me.
Why can't any of you keep it in your pants?
- Hello, Nine-Nine.
I'm Lieutenant Hopkins.
Hello, Terry Jeffords.
Come here and give an old friend a hug.
Hey.
So good to see you.
I'm shutting the Nine-Nine down, and there is nothing you can do about it.
Oh!
This place is fantastic.
This is gonna be fun.
She seems nice.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1 All right everyone, as you know, the NYPD intends to shutter one precinct in Brooklyn.
I'll be evaluating the Nine-Nine and sending my findings to the Deputy Commissioner.
Are there any questions?
Yeah, Veronica, are you sure you're the best person for that job, given our, um, you know - Sexual past.
- Thank you, Detective Boyle.
Sergeant Jeffords, don't be silly.
I won't let the fact that you and I have a history together affect the decision I have to make in any way whatsoever.
Well that's certainly good to hear.
I mean, sure, it took me years of intense therapy to get over and it's given me a fear of intimacy that has affected every subsequent relationship, but there's no reason I can't remain unbiased.
The way you just said that makes it seem like you actually are biased.
I have no idea what you mean.
That is all.
Okay, the plan is clear.
Sarge, you divorce Sharon, abandon your children, get back together with that monster.
- The precinct is saved.
- I'm not leaving my family.
Come on!
You didn't even consider it!
Why won't you print?
Ah, screw this.
No, no, no, no!
Not again!
What is going on here?
Stupid printer won't print out my stupid resume which means I can't send it to any decent stupid precincts when this stupid place shuts down.
That's not gonna happen.
Why are you being such a Gloomy Gus?
- I'm a Realistic Randy.
- Didn't go with Rosa, huh?
Ugh, I'm gonna have to meet a whole new group of people.
I hate people.
Life sucks.
Nothing good ever happens.
That's not true.
Come on!
What does Captain Holt always tell us?
Be a good cop, do your job, things'll work out.
Yep, just this morning, I found this old bag on the street and it has a cupcake inside.
See?
Scully found a garbage cake.
And I found us a dream case.
Involving one Ms. Cassie Sinclair.
- From "Serve & Protect"?
- Yeah.
- That is my favorite cop show.
- Yeah.
Apparently her laptop was stolen and it had "sensitive materials" on it.
You know what that's code for - Bank account numbers.
- Nudies!
One or the other I'm not a pervert.
The point is, Gloomy Gus, - not everything is terrible.
- Maybe you're right.
Maybe life isn't a miserable, unending, - maggot-filled pile of crap.
- Yeah, there you go.
Let's go find some nudies or bank account numbers both would be helpful.
Guys, we gotta do something about Veronica.
She's really out to get us.
We just need to find out what horrible thing Terry did to this woman so he can apologize and make it right.
I've been wracking my brain.
I can't think of anything.
- Did you cheat on her?
- No!
I would never do that.
Did you date one of her friends - right after you broke up?
- Uh-uh.
I cut off ties with all our mutual friends.
Even Tommy.
Terry loved Tommy!
Tommy turned Terry on to tennis.
Well, you did something to her.
We'll just have to get Veronica to tell us what it was.
It's time for a little girl talk.
You really think you can handle girl talk?
Relax.
I got this.
Hey Veronica.
It's time for some girl talk.
Let me see that bra!
Excuse me?
Didn't work.
What else we got?
Hey!
Huh?
- Whoa, this is dope.
- Dope it right.
- Welcome to the dream factory - Hey, man.
We gotta be cool, all right?
I know you have some fantasy about being a movie star.
I don't fantasize about being a movie star.
I fantasize about meeting one.
And being invited to a party at George Clooney's villa, where he pranks me and then we prank Matt Damon together and then Damon's like "Peralta, you got the goods.
You're gonna be the star of my next movie".
Wait, maybe I do want to be a movie star.
- Heads up.
Here she comes.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Ms. Sinclair.
I'm Detective Diaz.
This is Detective Peralta.
Oh, I like the way you wear your badge.
- Can I steal that?
- Absolutely.
Oh, hey, here's another little nugget for you, if you'd like.
Thanks for coming down to the precinct.
Oh, and one more thing I'm a cop.
Wouldn't the person already know that - if they were at the precinct?
- No, it works.
- So you had your laptop stolen?
- Yeah, last night.
Someone broke into my trailer, jimmied the lock.
I found out this morning from the second A.D. Ah, A.D., Announcing Department.
- Assistant Director.
- Oh, that's even better.
Hey, hi, Cassie, who's this?
Well, this is Peralta and Diaz, from the NYPD.
- They're here about the laptop.
- Oh.
I didn't think you were gonna involve the cops in this, but well, that's okay, here they are.
I'm Gary Lurmax.
I'm the Executive Producer.
Your name comes up at the end of every episode with that parrot that says: "Talk to my lawyer"!
Well, that's actually Walter, my pet African grey.
Ah, so cool.
Anyways, we're real cops.
Should we look at the crime scene?
Captain, can we talk?
Boyle, you know my feelings about bathroom conversations.
Steadfastly against.
I know; I just don't want Veronica to overhear.
I know what she's going through.
I've been broken up with six times.
Really?
Only six?
Yep.
Oh wait.
Does it count if they end the relationship but still want to be friends?
- Yes.
- Oh, then 210.
My point is, I'm worried that Veronica will never forgive Terry.
Is there anyone above her that you can appeal to?
She reports to Deputy Commissioner Grayson.
I've already tried to set up a meeting with him.
He's on vacation with his family in the Poconos.
Okay, so maybe we find out where he's staying and just happen to run into him and accidentally strike up a little convo about the Nine-Nine.
That seems rather underhanded.
Desperate times call for Desperate Housewives.
- What?
- Measures.
I said measures.
Frankly, sir, I know it's not protocol, but we don't have any other option.
Yes.
Good point.
It's not protocol.
But it just might work.
You know, Boyle, you're a bad influence on me.
I've never been a bad influence on anyone!
Should I bring my leather jacket?
It's ankle-length and fitted.
I won't bring it; it's too nice.
Well, I always keep my laptop in this bag, but this morning, it was gone.
Nine times out of ten, in a case like this, it's a stalker.
Whoever jimmied the lock didn't know what they were doing.
I concur.
This was a real hack job.
Hi, Mark Devereaux.
He plays Detective Cole Tracker on the show.
Yeah, he does.
And if I know Cole Tracker, the next thing you're going to say is  So what's it gonna be: rock, paper, scissors or gun?
You watch the show.
I like that.
So get me up to speed.
Who's been in here since the incident?
- What's he doing?
- Ohh.
I think he must be one of those actors who has to stay in character all the time.
I heard Dustin Hoffman did this on the set of "Tootsie" - and everyone hated it.
- On, no.
He just thinks he's a detective because he's been playing one for 15 years.
- I can hear you.
- Ah, look at that time.
They need you on set, Cassie.
I'll walk you over.
Ooh, has anyone noticed this crumb?
Might wanna bag that.
Send it to the boys at the lab.
Well, what have we here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't touch that.
Isn't this the case the laptop was in?
Yes, but in real life, when we handle evidence, we gotta wear gloves.
I never wear gloves on the show.
Fans love to see my fingers.
Almost as much as they love seeing my feet.
Google it.
- Nah.
- Nah.
Check it out.
Devereaux gave me his card and said, "Call me if you can think of anything else".
Just like on the show!
Does he know we're the real cops?
- I don't think so.
- Hey, guys.
You know, you two have a really compelling dynamic.
Would you ever consider being Consulting Producers - for the show?
- Absolutely!
- What does that mean?
- Well, we pay you to come in in your off hours, talk to the writers, tell them your stories, lend the show a little authenticity.
Wow, I can't believe I've been talking to people for free all these years like an idiot!
Great.
I'll run it by the studio.
He's gonna run it by the studio, Rosa.
I told you, if we're good cops, you do your job, things will work out and they do.
I don't know, man.
Something's weird.
I think the job offer is bogus.
He's trying to buy us off.
Look, I don't know about you, but I can't be bought off.
And it's gonna take a hell of a lot more than some job offer to make me compromise the integrity of the badge.
Hey, Jake, catering send over some chicken fingers.
Oh!
What is wrong with you?
We're working a case we'll definitely gonna solve, we're hanging out with cool people, Don't ruin this with all your Rosa-ness.
Think about it.
That producer guy didn't want us here at all.
And then after watching us work for, like, two seconds, he offers us a job?
It doesn't make sense.
That's just how show biz works, you rube!
Listen to yourself.
You're letting all of this cloud your judgment.
I love clouds; they keep the sun away on hot days.
He doesn't want us to solve this crime, so he's buying us off.
It's shady.
I love the shade; it keeps the sun away on hot days.
Besides, he's a rich guy what's his motive for stealing a laptop?
Leverage.
He and Cassie have been fighting over her contract.
- It's been all over the news.
- The trades.
They call them "the trades" here.
We read those in our trailers after we wrap and before we go home.
Fun fact: stars use the word "home" too.
- They're just like us.
- That job offer wasn't real.
- None of this is real.
- Yes, it is!
All right?
I know Hollywood and I know what's real!
For example, this door is fake.
Not a real door.
It's a "doorn't".
As in "doorn't open this".
And doorn't ruin my dreams!
Okay, Sarge, we just want to walk through your breakup step by step.
That doesn't mean we think you did anything wrong.
-  - Start talking, butthead!
I didn't do anything!
I respect women.
I'm a feminist.
I believe women should be on all the money.
I wanna pay for a sandwich with a $10 Ellen DeGeneres.
Maybe you hurt Veronica's feelings without meaning to?
Nope.
I planned the perfect breakup.
We got dinner at a mid-range restaurant nice enough to show I care, but not so nice she thought a proposal was coming.
I even got her a classy breakup present, plus a gift receipt, in case she wanted to exchange it.
And I said just the right words.
You deserve the world.
You deserve someone that can make you happy and it is the greatest displeasure of my life that I cannot be that man.
Thank you, Terrence.
I'm not saying you're lying, Mr. Jeffers, but if that's how things went down, why is Veronica so angry, you stupid liar?
- I don't know!
- You don't know.
Well, we could stay here all night until your story starts making sense.
I want to figure this out, too, but I have to go home eventually.
You think anyone cares about your damned plans?
I know I don't.
Do you care, Amy?
No, I don't.
Okay, so remember, this is Deputy Commissioner Grayson and his smoking hot wife.
You'll recognize her because she looks like an older Patti LuPone.
And you're sure this is the floor they're staying on?
Yes, I called his secretary and pretended to be his mother.
Or, should I say, "The Lady Grayson".
- Very sly.
- It's a little trick I picked up from the original bad boy  a Mr. Bugs Bunny.
Commissioner Grayson, is that you?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Raymond Holt.
Captain of the Nine-Nine.
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm on vacation.
You?
- Vacation.
- Vacation.
- Vacation.
- Vacation.
While we're on the subject of things are you by any chance in charge of the Brooklyn precinct contraction?
I don't want to talk about that.
If you have an issue, bring it up with your auditor.
- Well our auditor is actually - Listen, fellas.
If you think you're helping your precinct's cause, you're not.
Hey, sexy.
You ready to go?
Oh, that's my goddaughter.
What?
So Grayson's a philanderer.
What's that gotta do with the price of onions?
I don't know, sir.
This could be an opportunity.
I mean, WWBD, right?
What Would Bugs Do?
Good question.
What would Bugs do?
Bugs would blackmail Grayson.
Then I, sir, am no Bugs.
I won't break the law.
I'm not saying blackmail him blackmail him.
We just insinuate that we know what's going on and let him fill in the blanks.
Oh, so it's like he blackmails himself?
Uh-huh, you just go up to him and say, "Commissioner Grayson, how's your wife"?
Commissioner Grayson, how's your wife?
No, that just sounds like you really wanna know how she is.
Insinuate maybe add a pause before "wife".
Commissioner Grayson, how's your wife?
- Too long.
- Fouled hit.
- Ugh, this is not my strong suit.
- No, no, sir, sir, sir.
You're doing great.
Just forget the pause.
Use your eyebrows like this.
How's your "pump, pump, pump" wife.
How's your pump, pump, pump wife.
Eh, it was a little bit better in my head.
Try this.
How's your "pump" wife "pump, pump".
End on a double pump?
That's risky.
He'll see right through me.
How about "Pump, pump" how's your"pump"?
- You forgot to say wife.
- Ah, good note.
How 'bout this?
How's your"pump" wife "pump" Grayson "pump"?
That's the one.
I really don't think anyone in the crew would've done it.
We're like a family.
Yes, and as someone who's about to marry into that family, so to speak, I tend to agree with you, Sarah.
It seems highly unlikely anyone from the crew or producers would be involved.
Hey, Sarah, what's the status on the toilet seat heater for my trailer?
It's day four of cold butt cheeks going on over here.
I'm sorry, but this is official police business.
Putting the screws to her?
I got this.
Sarah.
You're a P.A. What do you make a year?
Two, three hundred thousand dollars?
30 hundred thousand dollars a year?
- 30 thousand.
- Oh.
Ooh.
And yet Cassie Sinclair pulls down millions sitting on her butt while you bust your hump running her errands.
I bet that makes you angry, angry enough to steal her laptop?
My gut says yes.
- Okay, that's enough.
- You're right.
She's not gonna talk.
Sometimes I wonder why I do this job.
You don't.
Okay, what about the Executive Producer, Gary Lurmax?
Do you know where he was on the night of the robbery?
He's normally in his office after wrap.
Although, last night he did ask me to tell him when Cassie left her trailer.
Hm, interesting.
Or completely useless.
No way to know for sure.
Sarah, one more question.
Those donuts, are they - They're all free.
- Okay, great.
Yeah, I wanted to make sure Cassie was out of her trailer because we were running behind, and we needed to make our day.
Is that normally an Executive Producer's job?
Well, I'm trying to be more hands on - network pressure, overages.
- Overages, sure.
I get those on my cell phone.
You know, it's been great watching you work.
Could I introduce you to the writers?
It'd just take a couple of minutes, tops.
They're very awkward.
They can't talk much longer than that.
Lead the way, hombre.
Hey, if you name a character after me, - that could be his catch phrase.
- I love that.
- Thank you, Gare Bear.
- I'll go grab 'em.
- Great.
- Hey, man.
Focus up.
We have a case to work.
That's why we gotta meet the writers.
I mean, one of them probably did it.
You heard Gary they're awkward.
They're probably all perverts.
Jake, wake up.
You're being manipulated by our prime suspect.
He's not our prime suspect, all right?
He's subprime at best.
Subprime mortgage crisis reference.
The point is, you just have to think the worst of everyone because that's how you see life.
It's sad.
You're sad and you're being a bad cop.
All right, I know you're just trying to hurt my feelings, but I'm in such a good mood about all of this that there's literally nothing you can say that'll bring me down.
"Lead the way, hombre" is a terrible catchphrase.
Nice try trying to hurt my feelings 'cause you didn't.
Looks like they left housekeeping one hell of a tip.
A finger tip.
And that's how I would lift up a bloody finger with my pen.
That is great.
Oh, in this episode, the perp is a cannibal.
Should I aim away from his stomach so I don't taint the evidence?
Yeah, that's definitely how I take down a cannibal when I do it.
Right.
What are you doing?
Talking to Cassie and the writers, who, b-t-dubs, all have alibis.
Also, Gary said that the studio approved us as producers.
I'm having my agent look over the paperwork.
Okay, fine, I don't have an agent.
I'm using my parents' divorce attorney.
He's my uncle.
He was disbarred.
Well, while you were off in fantasy land, I solved the case.
Wait a minute, Rosa!
Security camera across from Cassie's trailer - caught this yesterday.
- Gare Bear took the laptop?
Come on.
No one could've seen this coming.
Except for you.
You saw it coming, obviously.
Hey there, bud.
We've been going for a while you feeling hungry?
Starving, thanks.
Oh, come on!
You get a yogurt when I get the truth.
Oh God, it's in the grout.
It's gonna smell in here forever.
I told you, I did everything right.
I even gave Veronica plenty of time after her mom's death.
Wait, what does that mean?
I was gonna break up with her, but then her mom passed, so, like a gentleman, I waited.
That way she wouldn't have to deal with too much pain all at once.
How long did you wait, Jeffords?
I don't know, a year, year and a half.
- Sarge!
- Seriously?
What?
I was being considerate.
Believe me, she had her fun for those 18 months.
- Terry puts out.
- All right.
Also, there's no way she even knows I waited.
The gift you bought her, did you buy it when you first wanted to break up with her or when you finally did it?
The first time!
But why would that matter the gift receipt.
They all break eventually.
Get him out of my sight.
Ah, Commissioner Grayson.
Captain Holt, I told you, I'm not going to get involved.
I know.
I just wanted to say to you What's wrong with your face?
Do I need to call a doctor?
No, I'm clearly trying to communicate Captain!
There you are.
- We have an emergency.
- I'm taking care of it.
Okay, I don't know what this is.
But I'm going to leave.
Why did you stop me?
- I was making progress.
- I know, sir.
But I have to say something.
I love the Nine-Nine.
And the main reason why is you.
Not Jake.
Yes, clearly, it's mostly Jake.
But it's also you and the standard that you've set for us with your unwavering morals.
I'd rather we split up than stay together and compromise who we are.
Well, thank you, Boyle.
You're right.
No matter what happens, we'll feel better knowing we didn't resort to blackmail.
I agree.
From now on, the only black male I want anything to do with is you.
That was incredibly inappropriate.
I know, but I had thought of it and I was so proud, I just had to say it out loud.
- Let's just go.
- Great.
What's going on?
You can't just come in here.
- We have a warrant.
- Boom!
And that's a real one, not a prop.
Or have you forgotten the difference?
- Even when it comes to people?
- What?
"People" is me.
You used me like a prop.
I thought it was pretty clear.
Rosa got it.
- Nope.
- Detectives, you don't know what you're talking about.
- Found it.
- Oh, look at that.
Security cam caught you breaking into Cassie's trailer and walking off with this backpack.
You know what, you Hollywood types make me sick.
- Detective - For the record, your show stinks.
I've watched over 200 episode of it and I've never liked one.
- Open the bag, Detective.
- Happy to.
I can't wait to see the look on your face when I pull out Cassie's compu just a bunch of pills.
Cassie has a painkiller problem.
The show tries to protect her from herself.
That's why I was surprised she called the cops, but thanks for busting in here and telling me how much you hate my show.
And scene.
That was a great example of a cop making a mistake.
That's the kind of thing we can go over more when I come in on Monday for my first day of work.
No, you can forget about the job.
But you're still gonna name a character after me?
Well, I think we figured out her size: 34 Double Dead.
- You all right, man?
- No.
Could have been Detective Peralta saying that perfect pun.
I'm sorry the consulting job didn't work out.
Do you wanna head back and do some more interviews?
What's the point?
You were right.
Everything sucks.
We're never gonna solve the case, I'll never work in show business, and I'll never drink another smoothie.
Now you're getting it.
Everything is awful.
Our precinct is getting shut down and we're never gonna work together again.
I'll end up living in a car with a dog I can't feed playing sad songs on a harmonica I can't afford.
Never gonna see each other again.
The harmonica will get repossessed, I'll be all alone with my hungry dog and harmonica-less silence.
And we won't be friends anymore.
Wait, what?
You don't actually think that we won't be friends anymore if the precinct gets shut down?
Rosa, we will never not be friends.
Thanks, man.
- Get your hand off me.
- Yep.
Forgot the Rosa rule.
No touchy.
Oh, my God.
I just solved the case.
Season 8, episode 16, in which Detective Cole Tracker catches the Brooklyn Bra Butcher.
While wearing gloves.
But Detective Peralta, I thought Mark said his character never wears gloves on the show.
Oh, now that you mention it, that does ring a bell.
- That's my move.
- Oh, I'm aware.
You told us you never wore gloves when you picked up Cassie's laptop bag.
A double Tracker.
You wanted us to see you holding the bag because your prints were already on it.
From when you stole the laptop.
Cassie's only been on the show two years, but there's already talk of her getting a spin-off.
You were gonna post her personal photos - and humiliate her.
- Ridiculous.
I've never been more insulted in my life.
Your theory is outrageous.
And what's more, it's just a theory.
I don't know how cops around here do things, but where I come from, we're burdened with a little thing we like to call evidence, of which you don't have a shred.
We found Cassie's laptop in the trunk of your car.
I stand correct.
Yeah, you got me.
I did it.
Good job.
- Terrence.
- Veronica.
I'm sorry for how I handled our breakup back in the day.
I was trying to be a good guy, to be nice.
But sometimes, to be nice to someone, it means you have to be honest with them, even if it hurts their feelings.
Thank you for saying that.
Now you don't have to forgive me, but could you please at least give the precinct a shot?
- I would love to do that.
- Thank you so much!
Except I've already turned in my report.
Was it positive?
No.
It was real bad.
I made this saddle out of your sister.
And now I'm going to put it on your back.
And your sister and I are gonna trot you all around the apartment.
What's wrong with you?
I'm Jake Peralta, the grossest pervert of all time.
Hi-ya!
NYPD!
You're under arrest, you unbelievable creep!
You'll never take me alive!
Rot in hell, Jake Peralta.
They used my name!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
1 Attention, squad.
Here's where we stand vis-Ã -vis whether or not the precinct will be shut down.
The precinct will be shut down.
- What?
- No!
But I thought the official hearing wasn't until tonight.
Amy's friend at HQ heard that maybe the Seven-Four was getting shut down instead.
There's no way that's true.
Amy doesn't have a friend.
I do so!
Although, I only see her at work events, and we only talk through email.
Oh, God, she's just a colleague.
Santiago's work acquaintance is correct.
Tonight at 7:00 the committee is choosing between us and the Seven-Four, although the Seven-Four has a significant advantage.
They house an elite gang task force.
Well, this is on you, sir.
I begged you for a task force, but no, you wouldn't give me funding for Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha, colon, Hard Target.
You never told me what it was for.
It's a strike team that kills thunder and puts its colon on hard targets.
They're gonna split us up and send us all to different precincts.
This is the last time I'm gonna stand up here and look at you guys.
Hitchcock, close your damn legs!
No!
This isn't over yet.
Sure, maybe we don't have Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha, colon, Hard Target, but we're the Nine-Nine.
We have Rosa and Charles, Gina, Amy and Terry, and Carl!
- It's Mark.
- Sorry.
I was just trying to include someone from outside the inner circle.
There's an inner circle?
The point is we're not rolling over.
We're gonna solve a huge case before the hearing tonight, and then the NYPD cannot shut us down.
So come on, Captain, give me something big and juicy.
What do you got?
A ten-year-old had his bike stolen.
We are S'd in the B. Hi-do-ho there, Charlie old boy.
Come have a seat.
Beanbags?
But these are happy seats.
Why are you happy?
Oh, my God, you figured out how to save the precinct.
You got a juicy case.
You juiced this mama.
Nope, same unjuicy case.
New juicer attitude.
The way I see it, if this is to be our last ride then let us go out in a blaze of glory.
- Ooh.
- Charles, think about anything you ever wanted to do on a case.
We're doing it today.
Oh, hence the beanbags.
Hence is right, and also hence we're gonna drive around in the coolest undercover car in the impound lot.
Herbie from "Herbie Fully Loaded".
What?
No.
You really think "Herbie Fully Loaded" was on the impound lot?
- Without a doubt.
- Well, anyway, it's a Mustang.
It's got a stripe down the middle.
- Like Herbie.
- Okay.
One question, can we wear matching leather jackets?
Oh, man, I don't know if we're gonna have time to pull something like that together!
What?
Blaze of glory!
Blaze of glory.
You're not giving us any new cases?
There's nothing to work on.
Damn it!
So this is how it ends.
Well, every ending is a new beginning.
Another great Gina Linetti entrance.
You better savor these while you still can, sarge.
Gina, I am not in the mood.
How are you so unaffected by all this?
Because I have already moved on.
I'm devoting my energy to my new project, Ginazon.
It's a one-stop online portal for my legions of followers.
Speaking of whom, what's up G-Hive?
It's Queen Gee.
So I'm gonna prank all my coworkers.
That sounds like a bad idea for an already crappy day.
Fine, sarge.
I won't do it.
I will do it, so you can count this as my first prank I guess, unofficially.
Hey, Diaz, HQ isn't giving us any new cases because we might shut down.
You have anything?
- No, sorry, I got nothing.
- Oh, man!
I am one arrest away from the all-time precinct record.
Two more solves woulda put me over the top.
So?
Nothing wrong with second place.
Name one silver medalist.
- Michelle Kwan.
- She fell, Rosa.
She fell so much!
Oh, yeah.
Besides, it's not about me wanting the record.
It's about who currently has it.
Hitchcock.
both: Hitchcock?
How is that possible?
He's been here 20 years longer than me, and New York City in the '80s was basically "The Purge".
I always knew I was the best cop in the Nine-Nine, and now there's proof.
Oh, man!
My pasghetti!
We're getting you that record.
Hey, can I talk to the captain?
Ugh, he's on the phone.
Do you want a coffee while you wait?
They made me an extra one on accident.
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
Oh, my God!
What is that?
Cement!
You just drank cement!
Guys, check back in to see if she dies.
Ugh!
You're not really gonna die probably, okay?
Just a little honey for the G-Hive.
Also you can talk to Holt.
He is not on the phone.
What is happening?
It's a little something I call two pranks for the price of one!
Santiago, I'm on the phone.
Gina: Triple prank!
I'm so sorry, sir.
I can come back later.
No, it's too late.
The call is ruined.
Good-bye, dear.
What do you want?
Well, since there's a good chance that things are coming to an end, I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you've taught me.
I know you may not see yourself as my mentor, but Of course I do.
I've been mentoring you all this time.
What?
This is day 1,282 of a nine-year mentorship I Under ordinary circumstances I wouldn't reveal this to you until day 3,300.
It was real.
There was a binder.
Not anymore.
No!
You can still mentor me if we don't work together.
We could meet for breakfast every day.
You could teach me over eggs.
Eggs for breakfast?
You're further behind than I thought.
Ah!
No, look, okay.
There are ten hours left, sir.
If you talk fast enough, you can teach me everything.
Interesting.
Okay.
You'll have to take notes.
Do you think you can keep up?
Let's just say I was president of the Stenographer's Club in high school for a reason.
Was the reason because you were the only member?
Yes.
This is so cool!
I feel like we're in a cologne ad.
Oh, yeah, check this out.
- Whoop!
- Yeah!
Cleaning your teeth in public like you just don't give a what.
No, it's like a cool toothpick like Stallone in "Cobra".
Eh, lateral move.
Hey, I know this is just a stolen bike case, but you know what we should do?
Stand back-to-back with our guns drawn while we're surrounded by bad guys.
You know what I call that.
- The man sprinkler.
- Bullet tornado.
Yep, bullet tornado.
p, bullet tornado.
What was yours?
I didn't hear it.
Same as you.
Bullet tornado.
The important thing is we don't have to talk about it anymore 'cause we both said the same excellent name.
- Ah.
- Wait a minute, Boyle.
Is this our bike?
Green grips, orange pegs.
I think it is.
NYPD!
Hands on your head!
Hood slide.
Congratulations, punk.
Charles, tell him what he won.
You're supposed to tell him he's won an all-expenses-paid, luxury trip to hell.
We rehearsed this.
I'm sorry, I know.
It just hit me that it's over.
I wanted the case to last longer.
Come on, it's not necessarily over.
I mean, this guy could still make a break for it or take me hostage or have a huge bag of heroin.
Oh, my God, it's not over yet.
This just became a giant drug case.
- We can save the Nine-Nine.
- We can save the Nine-Nine!
- This man is our savior.
- And he looks like Jesus.
Yeah, he looks like a hunky Jesus.
- Yeah!
- Thanks for the heroin, Hunky Jesus.
- How'd the interrogation go?
- Awesome.
I got to do something that I always wanted to do.
You make me sick.
Hee-ya!
He was actually really helpful.
I feel bad.
Anyways, turns out he works for a dealer named Dom, who supplies half the heroin in the city.
If we take him down, there's no way they close the Nine-Nine.
But the hearing's in six hours.
How do we get the Dom?
Apparently he uses BMX riders to move his product, and as it turns out when I was a kid I was a vert fiend.
That's great news.
Please explain that.
- That means I rode BMX.
- Ah.
So we get our perp to text this Dom guy, tell him to hire me to move his product.
Then I show up, grind a bunch of gnarly rails.
I'm talking real fluffy ones.
Radical.
I bet you're an awesome fluffer.
- No.
- I bet you fluffed those other riders right out of their biker shorts.
- Charles - I can picture you as a teenager fluffing all of New York City.
Charles, stop talking.
Fluffing has a different meaning.
So I get the job, we take down Dom, precinct's saved, then I do an ice pick 360 on the podium at the press conference.
Awesome.
One question.
Do you still know how to ride?
Come on, riding a bike, it's like riding a bike.
Wheelie.
No.
Wheelie.
No.
Boyle, it's 'cause you're watching.
Okay.
One more try.
One more try.
One more try.
One more try.
One more try.
Did you do it?
Hey, sarge, check it out.
Hitchcock got a tattoo.
Mr. Nine-Nine.
Why are you putting a gun in your mouth?
I'm blowing smoke off the barrel.
It's cool.
The barrel is fully inside your mouth.
You're clearly about to kill yourself.
You're just jealous 'cause he's got the arrest record and you don't.
Yeah, suck on this.
Click, pow!
You pulled the trigger, man!
That was a suicide!
Sarge, I got a case for you.
Guy had his phone stolen at a bar last night.
All right!
It's not that big a deal.
I just need to file a police report for my insurance company.
No, it is a major injustice, and we're gonna set it right.
It was a crappy old phone.
I'd rather just get a new one.
We're the police and we're here to help you.
So shut your damn mouth.
Now tell us what he looked like.
I only saw his back.
Uh, he had a blue hoodie on.
Whoo!
We got a lead!
Ah, you just drank cement You just drank cement Dom just texted.
The meet-up spot is ten minutes away.
This is so awesome.
When I was a kid, I said I wanted to be a BMX detective, and they laughed at me.
Well, who's laughing now, Kenny Yarborough?
Kenny actually opened up a chain of salad places.
He's doing quite well for himself.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Hey, what if they can tell you're amazing but a little rusty and therefore kinda bad?
Not to worry, BMX is 99% attitude.
So here's the plan, my name is Tyler Omaha, born and raised in So-Cal.
Point me to a quarter pipe and I'm gonna tail-whip for days, bro.
And I'm your roller-skating sidekick, Chip Rockets.
- Welcome aboard, Chip Rockets.
- Thank you.
And you're married to the roller skates?
- A hundred percent.
- Roller skates it is.
Right.
Just 'cause you're only gonna be in the car.
- A hundred percent, Jake.
- Chip Rockets!
Chip Rockets.
Sorry, dude, we don't need any new riders.
You know, I used to be pro, but they said my antics were too gnar.
- Kicked me off the circuit.
- For what?
You know, peeing on the track, having sex during races, being hella gnar.
You get it, we all have gyros on our bikes.
The point is I can cut your delivery times in half.
Seriously, in half?
I think you're full of it.
I don't think you could even beat Bodie, and he's my worst guy.
Your worst guy?
Come on, I could take any of these posers.
Fine, then race Derek.
Nah, I don't wanna trouble Derek.
Let's just stick with Bodie.
First thought, best thought, right?
Let's do this.
It should take 70 seconds for you to fully gauge someone's character.
Here's what to look for.
Grammar, posture, scent, attire, level of perspiration, type of shirt collar.
What's the best type of shirt collar?
English Spread, obviously, but let's hold the questions until the end.
When people say, "Good morning," they mean, "Hello".
When people say, "How are you"?
they mean, "Hello".
When people say, "What's up"?
they mean, "I am a person not worth talking to".
There are two acceptable sleep positions.
On back, toes up, arms crossed, or on back, toes up, arms at the side.
Do not trust any child that chews bubble gum-flavored bubble gum.
Do not trust any adult that chews gum at all.
Never vacation in Banff.
Okay, you guys know the course.
First one to get to Creston and 10th rides for me.
Loser is out.
Hey, Bodie, you seem like a reasonable dude.
Just let me win and I'll owe you big time.
- I really need this.
- I really need this, too.
I haven't eaten in three days, and my bookie says if I don't pay him back he's gonna kill my dog.
Mm-kay that's very intense.
Please let me win.
Since my mom died, that dog is my only family.
I am so sorry.
I shouldn't have engaged.
- It got way too real.
- I'm gonna lose everything!
Yep, putting on my helmet now.
- Ready, go!
- Whoa!
He's so fast.
Too fast.
I'm losing.
-  - Whoa!
Chip Rockets!
Sorry about your dog, Bodie.
Oh, man, why'd I say that?
Now I feel terrible.
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win.
Wait, ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp!
Ahhh!
No!
Oh, I see what I did wrong.
I did the jump bad.
You okay, Jake?
Well, aside from the fact that the Nine-Nine's hearing is in four hours and we're definitely getting shut down, no, I bruised my thigh.
It's gonna be just fine, Jake.
No, it isn't, Charles.
It's on my right hip.
I sleep on that side.
It was stupid of me to think I could make this the best case ever.
Let's just go back to the precinct so you can make me hot cocoa.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but no, I will not make you hot cocoa.
Charles!
I have a bruise!
I won't do it, not when there's still a chance - we can save the Nine-Nine.
- What are you talking about?
Charles: When I took down that guy Bodie Chip Rockets!
Charles: I planted a bug with a GPS tracker on it.
Chip Rockets, you beautiful bastard.
Chip actually is a bastard.
Never knew either of his parents.
Raised by the rink.
Ooh, badass backstory.
Stole it from a TV movie.
It was about ice dancing, but I adapted it for the hardwood.
That makes it way worse, but I'm gonna move past it.
Let's track down Bodie and save the precinct.
Okay, we're making progress on your phone.
We went to the bar where it was taken Wait, why are you in handcuffs?
Because I've been arrested.
What?
By who?
Hitchcock, baby.
I busted his butt for filing a false police report.
He broke his phone, but insurance wouldn't reimburse him unless he reported it as stolen.
Are you serious?
How the hell did you solve this, Hitchcock?
Good old-fashioned detective work.
Yeah, they have no idea.
They think the phone was actually stolen.
You're under arrest, jerk-o.
Don't even think about it.
He thought the bathroom was empty because we use the toilet with our feet up on the stall door.
Explain any further and I will kneecap you both.
You can't boss me around.
I'm the greatest detective in the history of here.
Mr. Nine-Nine, out.
Okay, according to the tracker, Bodie's at a warehouse on 11th Street.
ESU is on site and waiting for our go.
Great, time to gear up.
It's not the best case ever without some toys.
Oh, yeah.
Toys for boys.
I don't know if I like that.
- Adult toys.
- Still sounds wrong.
- Male toys.
- You know what?
Let's just not call them toys.
That's my fault, I started it.
You got it, we'll just call them playthings.
We will not.
Let's do this.
Sniper binoculars.
Here, Charles, tell me how far away I am.
Too close to measure.
They really work.
That's everything.
Let's do this.
This is way too much stuff.
Yeah.
And it's too heavy to carry all the way back.
both: Terry.
Five minutes left.
What have I missed?
- Professional handshake.
- We did that.
Fingers with a half-centimeter spread, up, down, then separate.
Good.
Acceptable fabrics?
Cotton or cotton blend.
Wool is for outerwear only, and silk is for sex workers or musicians.
Right.
Good desserts?
There are none.
If you are hungry, you should have had more dinner.
That's it!
We're done.
You've been mentored.
Oh, my God!
We did it!
I can't believe we did it!
Oh, no, we did it.
It's over.
Yes, I agree.
Up, down, separation.
Separation.
Oh, girl, you look so sad.
You know what would cheer you up?
a nice bowl of miso soup.
No thanks, Gina.
I'm not in the mood.
So, Gina, is that soup up for grabs?
Scully, no.
My followers are sick of watching you eat cement.
There they are.
We are .
1524 kilometers away.
I have no idea what that means, but it's still pretty cool.
Charles, can you hear what they're saying?
- Uh, no.
- Really?
It looks like they're talking.
They're not.
They're definitely not talking.
I can see their lips moving.
Wait a minute, why won't you tell me what they're saying?
They're making fun of Tyler Omaha.
Oh, what?
I thought I was pretty good.
Me too!
And you definitely don't look anything like Rachel Maddow.
Oh, come on!
Hold on.
Something's happening.
That's a huge bag.
If that's full of heroin, we could really save the precinct.
Oh, I can just hear Holt now.
"I'm proud of you, Peralta.
You are my hero".
The guy is obsessed with me.
All right, we gotta make the bust now.
We only have 30 minutes left till the hearing.
No, no, no, no, wait, stand down.
It's not heroin in the bags.
It's money.
Yeah, that's millions in drug money.
We can still arrest them for that.
- Let's do it.
- No.
If they have that much money on them, it means they're probably gonna meet up with their supplier.
Can you hear what they're saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to make it out.
Sounds like oh, you're right.
They're getting a shipment at 8:30.
Whoa, Dom's one of the biggest dealers in New York.
Whoever their supplier is is gonna be huge.
- We gotta wait.
- But that's two hours from now.
We'll miss the hearing.
Let's just arrest Dom.
We'd be getting a major player off the streets.
I mean, isn't that the job?
So what are you saying?
I'm saying the Nine-Nine's gonna get shut down.
Damn it!
I know, it sucks, but it's the right thing to do.
No, not that, they're making fun of Chip Rockets now.
- These drug dealers are so mean.
- Right!
So it turned out this was the last ride after all, but it's a big bust, and at least we're going out in a blaze of glory.
Yeah.
It feels more like a blaze of crap.
Ah, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna get a new partner.
His name's gonna be Heath or Ryan.
He's gonna know everything about "Die Hard," and he's gonna be super cool.
Jean jacket cool.
Yeah, yeah, you could be right.
And hey, you'll get a cool, new partner too, right?
- Eh.
- He'll love fine dining and musical theater and hearing about every explicit detail of your sex life over and over and over.
Just like you.
Yeah, yeah, just like me.
Yes, you're right.
It's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be totally fine without you.
I'm gonna check the distance on the warehouse there.
Copy.
Yep, the building hasn't moved.
It's still .
1524 kilometers  away.
Wait, are you just holding up the binoculars so I can't see you cry?
No!
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Come to think of it, I'm gonna double-check our building distance as well.
Mm-hmm.
I see you filming, Linetti.
- What's in the yogurt?
- Normal stuff.
Nothing you'd use to make a sidewalk with.
Attention squad, I just got word from Peralta and Boyle.
Did they make their bust?
They save the precinct?
No, they decided to try to bring in a bigger fish.
They're not gonna make the hearing.
So Jake's doing the right thing instead of the selfish thing?
You did this to him.
Look, I know we all want this precinct to survive, but I'm proud of them.
Loyalty to your friends and fellow officers is important, but more important is our loyalty to this city and its citizens.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is let's go get drunk.
See anything?
Nope.
You?
No, I just love these binoculars so much.
I don't wanna put them down, you know?
Oh, man, when this case is over, I'm gonna miss these binoculars.
Me too.
It's almost 8;30.
We're gonna get into position.
Okay, thanks, Marv.
Are you guys crying?
I said thanks, Marv!
That means move on.
I'm sorry that our last case wasn't our best case ever.
No, don't say that.
Every case with you is the best case ever.
Oh.
Now come on, we still have a drug dealer to bust, right?
You know what that means.
- Bullet tornado!
- Man sprinkler!
Bullet tornado, that's what I said both times.
Okay, Marv, go, go, go, go, go!
NYPD!
Down!
Everybody, down!
Hey.
Congratulations on getting the record.
What are you talking about?
I came up short.
Hitchcock beat me.
What are all these?
B&E I worked last year.
You noticed a clue I missed.
Arson I solved last summer.
You gave me advice on how to break the guy in interrogation.
Blackmail from '09.
You said the nanny did it, and guess what, the nanny did it.
I don't understand.
You didn't just work your own cases.
You helped me and Jake and Charles and Amy.
There are hundreds of cases that wouldn't have been solved without you.
You add all that up, that's a record nobody's ever gonna touch.
Congratulations, Mr. Nine-Nine.
Thanks, Diaz.
Hey, guys, sorry we couldn't, you know, save the precinct.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Your moral compass is on fire right now.
Okay, forget I said anything.
This is better.
At least we had an awesome bust.
Yeah, we went back-to-back.
Oh, man, we must look so cool.
You finally did the man sprinkler.
What?
I never called it that.
Attention, squad.
I just got off the phone with One Police Plaza.
The hearing is over, and here's where we stand vis-Ã -vis the precinct being shut down.
The precinct will not be shut down.
- Oh!
- Yeah!
They decided to shut down the Seven-Four instead.
Wait, I don't understand.
Apparently the community came to our aid.
There was a swell of online support orchestrated by an organization called "Gina-zone".
I think you mean Ginazon.
I was behind the bar the whole time.
Another great Gina Linetti entrance.
I told you, you can't be back here.
And I told you, I already am.
What did you do?
I was live-streaming a prank when Captain Holt made his big speech about how you did the right thing for the city.
I guess people were moved.
They were like, "What can we do to help"?
And I said, "Call the commissioner's office".
The G-Hive is real.
I can't believe you did it.
Gina, you're a legend.
To the Nine-Nine!
all: Nine-Nine!
-  - Y'all just drank cement!
Santiago, the precinct's been saved.
Why are you so glum?
Because our mentorship is over.
I blew it all in one day.
Yes, volume one of our mentorship.
- There's more volumes?
- Of course.
You think I could fit it all in one binder?
Okay, good.
You don't seem very excited.
Oh, I was just adhering to section 7, page 145.
No emotional displays in the work place.
Excellent.
I tought you well.
Now, if you excuse me, uh I have some work to do.
On the roof.
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
1 - Good morning, everyone.
- Oh.
My.
Goodness.
Sarge.
What.
Are.
The.
Chances?
- I say zero?
- Ugh!
I mean, when Genevieve got me these suspenders, I thought I'd lean into it and go for the whole look, but I didn't want to step on your toes.
That being said, you know what this means.
- Don't do this, Charles.
- Oh, it's already done.
Gather round, y'all.
It's time to play "Who Wore It Best"?
I'd really rather not.
Because you're a wittle chicken?
Who wore it best?
Who wore it best?
Who wore it beeest?
- all: Terry.
- What?
- Come on!
- You should change, Boyle.
-  Fine.
- Not here!
Hey, Peralta.
How's it going, man?
Pretty good.
Thanks for asking.
Cool, cool, cool.
- So how's it going?
- I'm still pretty good.
- Nothing has changed.
- I hadn't heard about that.
All right, you're clearly not listening to me.
- I can say whatever I want.
- Tell me about it.
I murdered Charles this weekend.
I feel you.
Now that I have the taste for blood, - I can't stop murdering.
- Been there.
Okay, Sarge.
Sarge?
Jake.
When'd you get here?
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to see if Captain Holt is done with his meeting yet.
So, how's it going?
Okay.
We've been over this.
I'm pretty good.
Why are you acting so weird?
I'm nervous.
I'm gonna talk to Captain Holt about getting me more responsibility.
Well, got to go.
"Die Hard".
Explosions.
Whatever.
Wait, no!
Just when the conversation was getting interesting!
Hello, Captain Raymond Holt, it is I, Sergeant Terrance Jeffords, your friend, but more importantly, your employee.
I've never heard you speak like this, Sergeant.
I like it.
Each sentence so rife with information.
- Go on, please.
- Thank you.
I can do more, sir.
I'd like to take on additional responsibilities.
Good.
I like seeing you take initiative.
Let's see what there is.
One Police Plaza is looking for a City Council liaison.
That's a rewarding but challenging opportunity, but I think you'll do a great job.
That sounds perfect.
Thank you, Captain.
My pleasure.
The application is due tomorrow.
- Okay.
- It's 96 pages.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Not including a 4,000-word personal essay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
- Will that be a problem?
No!
Not a problem for Terry.
Terry does not have a problem at all.
Terry's got a big problem!
Ooh!
Math or real life?
Why would I have a big math problem?
- I've seen it happen.
- I'm supposed to pick up Cagney and Lacey from day care in 30 minutes, but I have to stay late to work on an application I just got from Holt.
They're six.
They can take the subway.
Rosa, that's crazy.
They're babies.
Terry, just call them an Uber.
Or just have your sitter pick 'em up.
Scully actually has the most reasonable idea.
These truly are strange days.
Sharon can't pick 'em up 'cause she's out of town with Ava, and the sitter doesn't get to my house till 6:30.
- Jake and I can pick them up.
- Absolutely.
Couple of issues I don't have any car seats, and my rear window is technically a "shower curtain".
- Really?
Why?
- Mm.
You know what?
Doesn't matter.
- Just take my minivan.
- You got it.
Thanks, guys.
I appreciate it.
Mm, mm-mm-mm-mm!
Mm-mm!
Why are you doing that with your face?
I'm smiling at Mommy and Daddy.
- Ugh.
- Gross.
Picking up Cagney and Lacey.
One taste of practice parenting, and you two will be so hot to have sex.
The kind that make babies.
- Walk away, Charles.
- Okay.
But I'll be back in nine months.
How ridiculous is Charles?
Pssh.
So ridiculous.
Pssh.
- Pssh.
- Pssh.
Pssh.
Hey, girls!
Who's the coolest person you've ever met in your entire lives?
both: You are!
And who's the most handsome dude in all the land, even objectively more than Idris Elba?
both: You are!
Man, kids are awesome.
You can tell them literally anything, and they'll just say it.
I know, right?
Check it out.
Who was the first female congresswoman?
both: Jeannette Rankin!
Oh.
That's fun.
They won't get teased for that.
both: Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Oh, uh, maybe don't play with the windows?
Jake, tell them to stop.
But playing with the windows is fun.
- Jake.
- And it could spark a lifelong interest in mechanical engineering.
But sure.
If you want, I'll tell these young girls that you don't think science is a good fit for them.
Play with those windows, ladies.
both: Yay!
That was actually really cool with Cagney and Lacey.
I think we rocked it.
Right?
I don't see what the big deal is about being a parent that was so easy.
Yeah, anyone who's ever complained about parenting has no idea what they're doing.
Mm.
Hey, it's the sarge.
Probably calling for some child-rearing tips.
Parent of the year speaking.
Terry, baby, talk to me.
Where the hell is Moo Moo?
Oh, no.
I think Terry has a child named Moo Moo, and we forgot to pick her up.
It's not a baby, Jake.
It's Cagney's blankie.
She calls it that because it has a little cow head.
She said she had it in the minivan.
Where is it now?
Uhhh all: Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down.
Never let 'em play with the windows.
That's Parenting 101.
And Santiago, I can't believe you didn't stop it.
I'm sorry, sir.
I knew it was wrong, and I did nothing, which is ultimately worse.
Cagney can't sleep without Moo Moo, and if Cagney doesn't sleep, then Lacey doesn't sleep, and if Cagney and Lacey don't sleep Terry doesn't sleep.
No.
Jake doesn't live.
- Oh, my God.
- Where did you start letting them play with the windows?
Uh, on Eighth.
It was close to the house.
It better be.
The sitter leaves in ten minutes, and this is the last thing I need!
Okay.
So sorry about this, Sarge.
Oh, and one more thing.
I love you.
I love you too, Jake.
Moo Moo?
Moo Moo!
What's going on, buddy?
- Oh, hey.
- Whoa, whoa, don't move.
- Oh, I was just - Step back.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Drop that.
Hey, Sarge.
We felt really bad about Moo Moo, so we got you a new one.
- She's called New Moo.
- I don't want it.
Oh, the liaison application got you down?
- I finished that.
- I know.
There's nothing sadder than finishing a nice, long juicy application.
It's like, why can't there be another essay or even a short answer?
No one is relating to you right now.
What's wrong?
I got stopped by a cop last night.
- Stopped for what?
- Stopped for walking.
That makes zero sense unless Oh, crap.
I see what happened.
- Yeah.
- Sarge, that's terrible.
That's so messed up.
Oh, jeez.
I have no idea what's going on.
He got stopped for being black.
- Get woke, Scully.
- What happened?
It was right after I found Moo Moo.
What're you doing in this neighborhood, - buddy?
- I live here.
Listen Whoa.
You need to lower your voice.
Lower my voice?
You know what?
Put your hands on your head.
Turn around.
Don't make any sudden movements.
I didn't do anything.
Also, I'm a Keep talking.
See what happens next, huh?
Big guy.
Well, did you tell him you're a cop?
I tried to, but things escalated so quickly, and I didn't have my badge on me.
I eventually told him, and he finally looked me up in the system and let me go.
I can't believe this I mean, nothing like that has ever happened to me, and I've done some pretty suspicious things in the street.
Hey, hey, hey, there.
What are you doing?
I'm just playing a prank on my buddy.
Sounds fun.
Carry on.
It was a very good prank.
I totally thought I was gonna die.
I mean, I've had run-ins with officers before, but this one really stings.
It was right outside my home.
So what are you gonna do?
Slash his tires?
You shouldn't do that, but just out of curiosity, what kind of car does he drive, and where does he park it?
You could file an official complaint.
I mean, Captain Holt would wield that like a hammer and crush the guy.
I don't want to start a whole hullaballoo, all right?
I mean, I think I just need to sit down with the guy and have a direct conversation, just to make sure he doesn't ever do anything like this again.
- That makes sense.
- You think you two can handle watching the kids while I meet with Officer Maldack?
Oh, they can handle it.
- Calm down, Charles.
- Ugh.
But yes, Terry, we can watch the kids.
Trust me.
There's nothing those little munchkins can throw at us that we can't handle.
Why was Daddy in trouble with the policeman?
Uh that's complicated.
Is it because he's black?
both: Uh What do we do?
We can't call Terry.
We told him we could handle anything.
I've got it.
We just leave.
We go home.
Never speak of this.
No!
We can't leave the children that are in our care.
- Right.
- Let me call Charles.
He's a parent.
He'll know what to do.
- Smart.
- Mm.
A parental crisis.
This is the good stuff right here.
You are knee-deep in the thick, rich broth of parenthood.
Well, that was a nightmare.
Who else can we call?
I'm already ahead of you.
Calling Rosa.
- Make 'em go to bed.
- It's 6:30 p.m. They're not tired.
Make.
Them.
Okay.
Hang up.
I'll call Gina.
Ugh.
Come on, Jake.
Just explain the deep-rooted institutionalized racism that remains pervasive in this country to this day.
Gina, they're children.
So put it in a song, Jake.
Watch this.
Racism, racism - I'm hanging up.
- Racism - Gina, I'm hanging up.
- Racism, baby That's a great song.
I'm hanging up.
Okay.
So Gina was a bust as well.
Looks like we're out of options.
Unless.
- No.
- It's all we have.
Hey, Jakey.
Yeah, I'd love to chat, but I can't.
Hitchcock and I are eating cake for dinner and watching a movie.
Ask Amy if she wants to come over.
I'm hanging up.
-  - Why're you smiling?
- That was useless.
- Are you kidding me?
Hitchcock and Scully just handed us a gem.
Who wants cake?
both: Me!
And who wants to watch "101 Dalmatians" and not ask any hard-to-answer questions about your father and race?
- both: Me!
Me!
Me!
- Nice.
Officer Maldack.
Thanks for coming.
Hey.
I'm really glad you set this up.
I'm so sorry for what happened.
Oh.
Wow.
I am really happy to hear that.
I was thinking this conversation was gonna go a lot differently.
No, no.
It was an honest mistake.
I mean, if I had known you were a cop, I never would've treated you that way.
So you're sorry for not knowing I was a cop sooner?
- Yeah.
- And that's it?
- Yeah.
- But you shouldn't have treated me that way whether I was a cop or not.
What do you mean?
I was just walking down the street.
There's nothing suspicious or illegal about that.
Okay, but you and I both know that you don't exactly look like you belong in that neighborhood.
- I live there.
- Look.
Nine out of ten times I get called to that neighborhood, it's about a guy that looks like you.
Were you responding to a call?
No, but you're missing the point.
No, you're missing the point.
I just want you to admit you only stopped me because I'm black and to apologize and say you won't do it again!
Hey, look.
We wouldn't even be having this conversation if you had your badge on you.
Next time, don't forget it.
Oh, so this is all my fault?
I'm not apologizing for doing my job.
That's not the job, man.
Whoa.
I can't believe it went down like that.
Should we maybe revisit some of our earlier ideas vis-Ã -vis tires and slashing?
I should've known there was no talking to a guy like that.
I don't see any other option.
I'm submitting an official complaint with Holt.
I know it might feel weird to report another officer, but it's the right move.
Holt's gonna eat him for breakfast.
Maldack has no idea what's about to hit him.
I'm not gonna submit this.
What?
Why not?
Because I think it's a mistake.
Hey, Sarge?
Everything okay?
Only ask 'cause you haven't moved in the last 58 minutes.
He doesn't want me to file the complaint.
Well, of course Officer Maldack doesn't want you to file the complaint.
He's the one being complained about.
I just realized you meant Captain Holt.
- Yeah.
- What?
Did you mess up the grammar - or something?
- Did you dangle a participle?
Ugh, Terry, Holt hates a dangler.
Grammar was fine.
He said he thought filing it was a mistake.
Wow.
Well, look.
Captain Holt cares about you more than anything.
I'm sure he's got a good reason.
Maybe you should go talk to him about it, you know?
Go to his house.
Yeah.
That's a good idea.
I'm gonna do that.
And while you're talking to him, Jake and Amy can babysit your kids.
Unless they're too busy making babies of their own.
- Shaka-daka-dow.
- Get out of us.
But yes, we are happy to look after the kids again.
Thanks, guys.
I appreciate your support.
Now, I'm gonna go find out what the hell is going on with Captain Holt.
Are you two sure you should be babysitting?
You seemed real freaked when you called me last night.
Yes, but then we figured out how to be good parents.
TV and cake.
TV and cake were my parents.
It's okay.
Sergeant Jeffords.
That's right.
It's me, Sergeant Jeffords, from the precinct.
I'm the guy whose damn complaint you don't want to submit, and I can't think of one damn reason why!
Everyone.
This is Sergeant Jeffords.
Hi!
I'm sorry for interrupting your dinner party.
No problem at all.
This is important.
Also, Kevin's friend Margo is here, and she's a real class-A drip.
Sir, I can't get why you don't want me to file the complaint.
I thought you of all people would support me.
First of all, let me say, what that officer did to you was wrong, deeply wrong, and I'm furious about it.
Okay.
So why don't you back me up?
Because that complaint could backfire.
Cops who blow the whistle on other cops almost always face a backlash, just like people who socialize with Margo invariably hear about her trip to Scottsdale.
You're real worked up about Margo.
Sorry.
She's horrible.
Listen, I don't want to see your career derailed because you were besmirched for reporting on another officer.
But what he did was wrong.
He should be besmirched!
Yes, but is that besmirching worth the greater besmirching of your career?
You have to balance besmirchings.
There's politics to being a cop.
But I wasn't harassed for being a cop.
I was harassed as a black man.
I'm not saying do nothing.
I'm saying the most powerful action you can take is to rise through the ranks so that you can make large-scale changes.
I've had to pick my battles, and it hasn't always been easy, but now I have my own precinct, a precinct whose officers would never do to you what Officer Maldack did.
I understand what you're saying, but Shh.
I hear Margo's squeaky shoes in the hallway.
One guess as to where in Arizona she brought them.
Scottsdale.
Oh.
Ray.
There you are.
I'm about to start my Scottsdale slideshow.
It has all the highlights.
There are no highlights in Scottsdale, Margo.
That's what you think, Raymond.
Okay, we got chocolate-chocolate, chocolate-vanilla, and my personal favorite, a bowl full of cake batter.
- And loads o' movies.
- Eh?
We don't want to do that.
Uh, maybe you didn't hear us correctly.
We've got cake.
We've got movies.
It's time to party!
- Is being black bad?
- We're black.
Are we gonna get in trouble like Daddy?
Jake, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes, please.
- We have a problem.
- I know.
What kind of kids don't want to eat cake?
Should we call Child Services on Terry?
Jake, I think we have to face the music and talk to them for real.
I know.
You're right.
But I'm gonna munch the cake batter while we do it.
If you don't eat the raw egg fast, it makes you even more sick.
- Never mind, let's go.
- Okay.
Okay, girls.
There's something called prejudice, which comes from the Latin words "pre," or "before," and "judicium," which means "to judge".
Are you with me so far?
- both: No.
- No.
Okay.
Um, you know how it's tougher in this world to be a woman?
both: It is?
No.
No, no, no.
That's not what I meant.
Then I don't want to be a woman.
- Me neither.
- You don't have to be if that's who you are you know what?
That's a whole other conversation.
Uh  Okay.
Here we go.
A cop did a bad thing and tried to get your daddy in trouble, but your daddy didn't do anything wrong.
Because Daddy's black?
Yeah.
That's scary.
It is scary.
But that cop was wrong, and what he did was bad.
And the most important thing is your daddy's okay, and he's not in trouble, and he loves you both more than anything in the world.
Okay?
both: Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, that wasn't so bad.
Well, if you guys have any other questions, we're here for you.
- What's an orgasm?
- Come on!
Terry, I know you're upset, but this is the right thing to do.
You're this close to the City Council position, and that's just the beginning.
It would be a shame to jeopardize that.
Look, I get that the guys in our precinct wouldn't profile me, but it still happened only one precinct over.
Which is why you need to keep pushing forward in your career, so that you can change the system.
Terry, you're a great cop.
You could become a chief or higher.
How long will it take to make change that way?
Maldack is on the street now.
You know why I became a cop?
Please share.
Because when I was a kid, I always wanted to be a superhero.
Stop it!
Stop bothering little Terry!
- Or what?
- Or I will defeat you!
Whoa.
I wanted to help people like that cop helped me.
But right now, I don't feel like a superhero.
I feel the opposite.
When I got stopped the other day, I wasn't a cop.
I wasn't a guy who lived in a neighborhood looking for his daughter's toy.
I was a black man, a dangerous black man.
That's all he could see: a threat.
And I couldn't stop thinking about my daughters.
And their future.
And how years from now, they could be walking down the street, looking for their kids' Moo Moo, and get stopped by a bad cop.
And they probably won't get to play the police card to get out of trouble.
I don't like that thought, and I'm gonna do something about it.
So I don't care if it might hurt my career.
I'm filing that report.
Even if I have to go over your head to do it.
Kind of seemed like you were gonna get up and leave after saying all that.
I was, but I think I hear Margo.
Thanks for babysitting last night.
The girls told me what you talked about, and it couldn't have been easy.
I'm sorry I told them orgasms was another word for oranges.
I panicked.
Yeah, it did make it awkward when they asked for orgasm juice this morning, but I was more talking about the other stuff.
Yeah.
We didn't really know what to say.
At one point, I'm pretty sure I sang all of En Vogue's "Free Your Mind".
Well, they had fun, and you made 'em feel safe.
You did good.
Oh.
They made you a "thank you" card.
Aww.
Pretty sure my nose isn't quite this big, especially with all the racial sensitivity talk, but I appreciate the effort.
Sergeant Jeffords.
A moment of your time, please.
I came to a realization after you stormed out last night.
I wouldn't say I stormed out.
I shook hands with both you and Kevin before I left.
And Kevin and I agreed that you squeezed significantly tighter than necessary.
I guess I was a little worked up.
With good reason.
I thought a lot about our conversation.
When I was a young police officer and things like this would happen to me, I felt very alone.
I wanted to call out every bad cop I encountered, and there were a lot, but as a black gay man, I never had a superior who was on my side, so the advice I offered you, that came from a different place at a different time.
I put all my energy towards rising to a rank where I could make a difference.
Well, I'm there now, and I realize that if I don't back you up on this, I would be betraying the very thing that I worked so hard for, so I filed the complaint.
I appreciate that, Captain.
- Are you still upset?
- No.
Not at all.
You should consider modifying your handshake.
It's sending the wrong message.
Copy that.
Whew.
I am so glad we don't have to do any more babysitting for a while.
I know.
It was so stressful.
So stressful.
But, like, actually kind of rewarding too.
Shaping young minds like that felt so powerful.
- Yeah.
- But, like, so exhausting.
Oh, yeah.
Can you imagine doing that every night?
Forget it.
But also, their little shoes are so cute.
They're like little circles.
I know, and everything they hold looks so big because their hands are so tiny.
Yeah, and they have to hold a cup of water with both hands - 'cause they're so weak.
- I know!
Whoo-whee!
That's what I'm talking about!
- both: Boyle.
- Lucky for you, Amy, I am an unlicensed doula.
I've delivered three of my cousins and one of my uncles long story.
- Go away!
- Yes, Papa.
Please close the blinds.
We're about to violate several departmental regulations.
Ho, ho!
All right!
It's been a very long week, and as of right now, we're both off duty.
I think we've earned a drink.
I can get behind that.
I heard from City Council about the liaison position.
Is that right?
You didn't get it.
Oh.
Oh, this is a sad drink.
Was it the complaint?
We'll never know for sure, but, uh, I think it's likely.
However, this is not a sad drink.
We're celebrating to doing the right thing.
I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't have filed the complaint.
Maybe I could've done more if I had gotten the liaison job.
Maybe.
But one thing's for certain.
Maldack will think twice before making another bad stop like that again.
That's a win.
Yeah.
It's tough.
It is.
So if Sharon's still out of town, who's, uh, looking out for Cagney and Lacey?
both:
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
1   Oh hello.
Guys, guys, guys, check it out.
Hitchcock fell asleep in the break room, so I put his hand in a bowl of warm water.
Come on, man.
That's the stupidest prank ever.
Uh, no, it's the smartest because it involves biology.
I bet it worked already.
Let's go check.
- Hitchcock, no!
- He's drowning, he's drowning!
Save him, man!
-  -  I take it back, Jake.
Great prank.
Is everyone packed for the 28th annual Tri-State Police Officers Convention?
I hear Bill Powell's giving a lecture on advances in appellate court e-filing techniques.
Phew, talk about "can't miss".
Yeah, we don't really go for the talks.
We're more interested in the extracurriculars.
- Fart-five.
-  Of course, Rochester has much to offer in that sphere.
For instance, it's famed thermometer museum.
Thermometer museum?
Uh, no thanky.
Here's what a-we are all about.
One, free hotel rooms.
I get to sleep in a bed by myself.
No wife, no kids, just Terry starfishing on a Cal King.
Two, a huge hall full of cool police tech.
Last year, I got to try out a heat ray.
Three, the Buffalo P.D. always throws an insane party.
Last year, Amy got so drunk, she jumped a police horse into the pool.
Eight-drink Amy is an equestrian, and she's real bad at it.
This isn't an excuse for you to party.
This is a police convention, not the Newport Folk Festival.
Come on, sir.
It's been a hard year.
I mean, frankly, we could all use a party to blow off some steam.
First we were on the night shift, then the precinct almost got shut down.
I got hit by a bus.
Well, we have been through a lot, but, frankly, our reputation has taken a hit.
That's why I'm running for a seat on the convention's board of directors.
If I win, it will look good for the precinct.
So please don't do anything to jeopardize that.
Understood?
Dismissed.
That's a big ole bummer.
All right, everybody, just relax.
We're still gonna have a great time.
If there's one thing I know, it's how to sneak out to a party without your parents finding out.
I used to do it all the time.
Well, I did it a few times.
Once, to go to a Magic: the Gathering tournament.
I got stuck in the window like Winnie-the-Pooh.
There, okay?
Now you know everything.
My mom had to pull me back in by my ponytail.
All right, let's party!
What is taking so long with those keys?
I gotta hit that pillow top.
It's starfish o'clock.
Guys, guys, they're here.
Hey, hey, what's up B.P.D., aka Buffalo Party Department.
That is gold.
You guys coming tonight, right?
Obviously, it's the only reason any of us are cops.
All right, detectives, here are your room assignments.
Uh wait a minute.
What's going on here?
- You guys planning a party?
- What?
No, we're just debating our favorite parts of the conference.
He likes his Q&A's moderated.
I like mine unmoderated.
- Why is that?
- I just I'm just sick of the moderator bias.
I couldn't agree more.
Your story checks out.
See you at the party.
Let's check out some tech.
Ooh, look.
This is a long-range heart beat detector.
You can hear a human pulse through walls.
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh, whoa.
Excuse me.
Oh, my God, it's like a She-Scully.
I'm, hi.
Uh, Norm.
- Uh, who are you?
- Shatz.
Uh, Cindy Shatz.
- Scully, shake her hand.
- Oh, uh, here I go.
- Meet to please you, Shatz.
- Your hands are so clammy.
I ate a bunch of clams earlier and they still smell.
- No, that's not what she meant.
- No, it was.
- Anyway, it was so nice to meet you.
- Why?
Okay, uh, I'll see you around.
Guys, I was just talking to that amazing woman and I blacked out.
Did I get her number?
- No, you chunked it.
- Ugh, of course I did.
I'm not Hitchcock when it comes to the ladies.
- You don't wanna be.
- Oh, he's fearless.
I once saw him ask out a breastfeeding mother.
Ooh, look.
It's a robot that can patrol an empty building all by itself.
Oh, no, this is how it starts.
It's Skynet all over again.
Here, let's wait here a second and see if our future selves show up and tell us to destroy it.
Nope.
Looks like we're in the clear.
- It's kind of cute.
- Hey, check it out.
It's called The Wasp.
It's for dispersing crowds of young people.
It emits a sound that you can only hear if you're 35 or under.
-  -  -  - Ah, I also hate the sound - that I definitely hear.
- Me too.
It's so high-pitched or low-pitched.
Oh, that was bogus to the extreme.
So bogus and not tubular.
My ears are ringing from the pain of being young.
Ugh, so not gnarly.
Captain, you missed the tech expo.
We got all this swag.
Six tote bags.
Terry can tote anything.
Look, point at something, I'll tote it.
Oh, no.
Hold still.
I'm gonna hide behind you like you're a tree.
Uh, why are you doing that?
On the other side of your trunk, is the worst person I've ever met.
Captain Jeffrey BouchÃ©, the living embodiment of evil.
Raymond Holt?
As I live and breathe.
You have not aged a day.
So how's Kevin?
How's Cheddar?
Come on.
Tell me everything.
Kevin is fine.
Cheddar is a dog.
He has no concept of good or bad.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
He's a very clever dog.
Hey, I wanted to tell you that I am also running - for the board of directors.
- You are what?
Yeah, I had no idea that you were running, but, listen, it doesn't matter 'cause you're gonna win anyway.
I mean, you're Ray Holt.
But look, I gotta go.
I will see you soon.
- I hope not.
-  You're being a little harsh on him, Captain.
I've been up for promotions against that man on six occasions, and he's prevailed every single time.
Why?
Because he's a snake.
Isn't it possible he gets promotions because he's nice and people like him?
Please, I hate to say this about anyone, let alone a fellow officer, but that man is full of balone-nya.
- "Baloney".
- You're right.
He's so vile, we should use the crude Americanization of the word.
He's full of baloney.
Holt went to bed early 'cause his big speech is in the morning.
Well, how do you know he's in for the night?
Because his breakfast order is hanging on the doorknob.
Water, comma, hot.
Muffin, comma, English.
And that means it's time for us to hard, comma, party.
- Hey, what happened?
- Sorry, bro, they busted us.
'Cause the party got too crazy?
- Yeah, totally.
- They've been taking bribes.
No, it was because of the party.
That's what you should tell everyone.
Oh, no.
The party's not happenin.
That means we're just in a hotel in Rochester.
This is a nightmare.
I learned a bunch of new dance moves for tonight.
- Ones where you move your butt.
- Ugh, screw this.
I'm gonna get a ride back to Brooklyn with some drifter.
No, we came here to blow off steam and we're not gonna give up yet 'cause we're the Nine-Nine.
We're gonna take matters into our own hands Nine-Nine style.
That's right, my friends.
The Nine-Nine is throwing a big - Can I borrow $200 for alcohol?
- Mm-hmm.
The Nine-Nine is throwing a party!
Okay, I talked to some of the vendors at the tech expo, and they agreed to hook us up for the party.
Check it out.
Disco lights, sound system, and beer cooler.
Leak-free, insolated body bag.
Our beer is dying to get inside.
I don't know, man.
Holt didn't want us going to a party, he certainly doesn't want us throwing one.
Oh, poor, simple Terry.
For such a bemuscled specimen, you certainly do frighten easily.
I promise you, Holt won't find out.
His room is all the way across the hotel from ours.
He insisted so he'd have a view of the Rochester skyline.
Ah, drink it in, Peralta.
The Mustard City.
Besides, if he does leave his room, my new partner will warn me.
- New partner?
- K-13.
- Hello.
- It's a robot!
I can program it to wait outside Holt's door, and if there's any movement, it'll send us an alert.
All right, I'm in, but only because your robot is so cool.
I don't know.
It's not that cool.
I mean, all he's doing is standing guard.
- I mean, I could do that.
- Awesome, if you do that, then K-13 can come to the party.
I am programmed to boogie my butt.
No, I'm going to the party.
People prefer me over a robot.
Right?
- Hey, going pretty good, right?
- Hell, yes.
It's like a Bonnie Raitt concert in here.
- No.
- Hey.
We're about to do the Taser challenge, - you guys want in?
- What's the Taser challenge?
We tase each other, then drink.
- How do you win?
- What are you, a lawyer?
- You want in or not?
- Yeah, Terry.
What're you, a lawyer?
It's Tasers.
Get tased at a party, man.
Come on.
She's here.
She's here.
Cindy Shatz is here.
What do I do?
My face is so wet and my mouth is so dry.
Okay, calm down.
Remember, be direct.
Women don't like to play a lot of games.
I think we gotta start simpler.
Okay, Scully, smile at her, don't fart.
He knows not to oh, you're writing that down.
This is good stuff.
What else you got?
Don't talk about your foot fungus.
Don't talk about your eye fungus.
Let's just say "fungus" is off the table.
Oh, no, see you just wrote the word "fungus" down and I feel like we're barreling towards a misunderstanding.
Draw a circle around it and then put a line through it.
- There you go.
- Believe in yourself.
Be confident.
You're a sweet guy - with a big heart.
- It's the size of a giraffe's.
- Pushes on my other organs.
- Okay, you got this.
Don't talk about the giraffe heart.
- All right, get outta here!
-  - Hi, Cindy.
- Hey.
So guess what my eye and foot have in common?
What?
Uh I can't say.
Well, bye.
All:  Chug!
Jake, this party is insane.
Forget Bonnie Raitt, it's like the video to "Love Shack" in here.
- This is the greatest.
-  Oh, God.
It's my new partner.
You guys are texting each other now?
It sends alerts.
Holt left his room.
He's on his way here.
Well, we gotta get everyone out of the hallway.
All right, be quiet!
Everybody, be quiet!
They're not listening to you.
Where's Amy?
She's great at shushing.
Wait, all of these dum-dums are under 35.
- Let's use The Wasp.
- No.
It'll hurt my young, little ears so much.
Ah, come on.
-  -  Attention, our boss is headed this way.
Everyone has to clear the hallway right now.
Shh!
-  - Wow, she is great at shushing.
I know, she's like a librarian.
You mean, like a sexy librarian?
No, a regular one.
Everyone, you will go in the rooms and you will go right now.
Don't make me count to three.
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey, Captain, what's up?
Uh, which room is Sergeant Jeffords?
Oh, Terry's in here with me and Amy.
You know, we're just having a low-key night watching "House Hunters International".
This orthodontist really wants to live in Panama with his strangely old wife and won't say why.
- Can I talk to him?
- Uh, let me check.
Shh, shh.
Yeah, no, he's asleep.
Can I help you with something?
I'm concerned that my presentation isn't, uh, "jazzy" enough to compete with Jeffrey's.
- He's such a showman.
- Yeah.
I'm thinking about augmenting the graphs with, um - color.
- Sir.
I know.
I'm debasing myself.
Anyway, give this to Jeffords.
He's the artist.
I'd like him to choose the, um - Color?
- Yes.
All right.
Oh, time to turn in.
Nighty, night.
Okay, he's gone.
Now just gotta wait for K-13 to give us the all clear.
Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath.
Dumb robot probably rolled into the stairwell.
That's why you shouldn't be best friends with this tin can.
K-13 says we are G-2-G.
Amy?
The shush is lifted.
Party time!
Beer me!
- Yeah!
-      Mm, hey, Captain.
Are you just waking up?
It's 11:00 a.m.  No, no, I'm just tired 'cause, um, I worked out so much this morning.
- Ah.
- You know, squat 400 on the bench push fitness and whatnot.
- What's up?
- I need my laptop.
I wanna practice my speech with the new colors beforehand so I'm not alarmed when they pop up.
Right, right.
Um, I know that Terry definitely did do that work, - so I'll just go grab 'em.
- Okay.
Uh, you wait here.
You can't come in because Amy's naked and she's embarrassed of her weird body.
Terry.
Terry.
- Terry.
Terry.
-  Why's my tongue so big?
Because you're a big person.
Holt is here.
He wants his presentation.
The presentation!
I didn't do it.
Okay, I just need to add color.
It'll only take two minutes.
- Stall him.
- Okay, no problem.
I'm definitely got two minutes worth of stall material.
Okay, Sarge will be right out.
In the mean time, why don't you and I just chat, you know, for a couple minutes about brumpst.
Brumpst?
Hold on.
I couldn't stall him, he's too good, it's not my fault.
Where are you on the presentation?
Jake, Holt's laptop isn't here.
It's gone.
Where are you on my graphs?
The presentation is - in 90 minutes.
- I'm definitely all done, but I'm worried, if you're going up against Jeffrey, will color be enough?
I was thinking, slide transitions.
Oh, good grief.
Very well.
You may add cross dissolves.
But so help me God, Jeffords, if I see even one star wipe - I just need a half an hour.
- Perhaps I should supervise.
No, you should clear your head.
Work out.
Rosa was just headed to the gym.
She'll keep you there.
Be right back.
Rosa, I need you to workout with Holt for the next half hour.
Cool?
-  - Great.
I'll get your sneakers.
This is invigorating, isn't it?
I can't believe you lost the captain's laptop.
You were kind of out of control last night.
I was not.
Although, pretty sure my ribs are broken, and I think I'm wearing a pillowcase I cut holes in - as a shirt.
- We have to think.
Does anyone remember having the laptop?
Wait, we all left the room and went somewhere and I didn't want to leave the computer behind with so many strangers, so I took it!
Yes, Charles, you're a genius.
All right, we gotta split up and search the hotel.
Wait a minute.
Why is my shoe all wet?
The pool!
Damn it.
No sign of the laptop.
What were we doing here?
Look, there's Jake's shirt.
It looks burnt.
Because I was on fire.
Hence the pillow shirt.
It's all coming back to me.
I'm a human torch!
Nope, it was just that one memory.
- This was a dead end.
-  I remember why you were on fire.
The State Troopers brought fireworks.
Yes.
We're unraveling the mystery.
- It's like we're detectives.
- We are detectives.
Right.
Another thing we remembered.
This is going great.
Oh, Raymond.
Of course you have beaten me to the gym.
You live life right.
It's amazing.
Workout your legs, Jeffrey.
Not your mouth.
You are hilarious.
I am so psyched for your presentation to the board.
- I'm sure it's gonna be amazing.
- I'm gonna crush you like a can of diet seltzer water.
I don't doubt it.
Well, I'm off to do some squats.
Dumbass.
Okay, so this is definitely where we set off the fireworks, but still no laptop.
How did I catch on fire?
Oh, no, I just remembered something.
Terry feels bad.
-  - What the hell was that?
-  -  Ah!
Ah!
Hence the chest pain, but what was that loud crash?
I think that might have been me.
See you in hell, partner.
You killed her?
Her?
Oh, my God, it was a her.
You were replacing Amy, not me.
- What have I done?
- Wait, the robot has a camera.
Maybe she saw who took the laptop.
- There's the laptop bag.
- You think you're so much better than me.
- You're right.
- I'm just gonna fast forward.
Oh, hey, robot.
I got something really cool to show you on the balcony.
I think you're really gonna like it.
Oh, you're heavy.
- Fast forward.
- Did you guys see that?
He put the bag down behind the plant.
Let's go.
Is it there?
Is it there?
- It's here!
- We did it!
- We found the bag!
-  Oh, wait, hungover.
No spinning.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
I'm good.
-  - Oh, hey, hey!
Oh, Scully.
You bummed about Cindy or you just feel at home in a body bag?
We use the same medicated powder.
I could smell it.
- She's my soul mate, Amy.
- So she doesn't like you.
It happens.
I mean, not to me, but not everyone has my combination of elegance and charm and grace and poise, and then just gif-ability.
Some would say "jif," but then some would also say "syrup".
Wait, what if we could give Scully our personalities?
He would love that.
We could talk to him through an earpiece - and tell him what to say.
- Okay, but can we attach a string to it?
Last time I wore an earpiece, it fell in.
- How you doing, Scully?
- Nervous.
I can feel my legs.
That never happens.
- Something's wrong.
- Okay, just go up to her and repeat what we say.
-  I wasn't gonna - Hi, there.
Scully, hey.
Both: Cindy, there's something I want to say to you.
The moment I first saw you You took my breath away.
Both: Whenever I'm around you My heart beats faster.
I know you're going home today Both: But I couldn't let you leave without asking you out.
- Cindy Shatz - Cindy Shatz - Can I buy you a drink?
- Can I buy you a drink?
No, I'm sorry.
I'm not interested.
- What?
- No.
Guys, earpiece fell in.
What on earth took you so long?
Yeah, where the frigging hell were you?
I was trying to get the colors right, but in the end, I decided to just go with your original black and white.
It's probably even one color too many.
Anyways, in you go.
Looking good, Diaz.
- Bite me.
- Okay.
Uh, hello, I'm Captain Raymond Holt, and if I have the pleasure of joining your board, here are some of the things that I would do.
See?
It all worked out.
We threw a wild party with absolutely zero consequences.
-  - Jake, something's wrong.
Oh, um oh, I don't know how that got in there or what it is.
Um, I'll just, uh next slide.
Well, that's strange.
Next slide.
Next.
Next.
Oh, I see what's happening here.
Uh, due to an issue with the Internet cloud, you are seeing a series of pictures that have nothing to do with me or the 99th precinct.
I don't get it.
Who even took these pictures?
I did.
You guys should really be a lot more careful about leaving laptops lying around.
For next year.
Consequences.
My, oh, my.
Boyle, can you even tell me what is happening in this picture?
Uh, that's me doing a Jean-Claude Van Damme split between two beds.
I had to wear my underwear for flexibility.
Mm-hmm, and, uh, Santiago?
I believe that is me throwing up - into a pillow case.
- Uh-oh.
You have all embarrassed the precinct.
Now when people think of the Nine-Nine, they'll think of, um oh, Detective Diaz filling an iron with tequila.
So I could make tequila steam.
I can quite believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm sorry I even came to Rochester.
-  -  Hey, it's all right, Scully.
We'll find a way to make it up to him.
Ah, it's not about him, Jake.
I'm just sad because I'm an unlovable sack of fungus, and I'm gonna be alone forever.
Oh, um Hey, there's probably someone out there for - We got this.
- Oh, thank God.
Wow, pint of milk on the rocks.
- Real Scully move.
- Can I help you?
Hi, we're friends of Scully's, and we're not sure why you rejected him?
Now, we know Scully's not perfect, his hands smell like clams, and, yeah, over 75% of his body has died, and Gina, you can stop listing things.
Point is, he's a good guy.
You should give him a chance.
I know, when I first meet him, I was intrigued, but then Mr. Confident showed up, I'm not interested in that.
Confident people are mean and selfish.
Wait, you liked awkward Scully?
Giraffe-heart Scully?
Oh, my God, he has a giraffe heart?
Aww, I bet it pushes on his organs.
We'll be back in five minutes.
Wait right here.
Bartender, can you top off her milk?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- You wanna hear a joke?
- Okay.
I don't know any jokes.
I should go.
Oh, that's okay.
I don't know any jokes either.
I slept in a body bag last night.
- Whoa.
- They're so cute.
Oh, no, Scully, don't put your finger in her mouth.
Oh, she likes it.
Captain, I'm sorry that things got out of hand, but you can still be on the board.
I read 85 pages of the convention bylaws, - and - That was unnecessary.
- I don't wanna be on the board.
- But I read bylaws.
I wanna show you a picture from last night - that really upset me.
- Okay, but in my defense, Rosa bet me 50 cents that I couldn't drink all that shampoo.
That's not what I wanted to You drank shampoo?
What?
No.
You're the one farting bubbles.
This is what I wanted to show you.
Do you know what disappoints me most about this about this picture?
That I'm not in it.
I can't remember the last time I saw the Nine-Nine so happy, - and I wasn't there.
- 'Cause you were working on your presentation to get us a win.
Yeah, well, it wasn't a real win.
- I wish I had been in that photo.
- I know, and I'm sorry you didn't have more fun this weekend.
But it's not over, and we are still in Rochester.
What are you saying?
I think you know what I'm saying.
What a thermometer.
Look at the mercury reservoir on that mamacita.
Oh, Peralta, this is amazing.
I'm floating on air.
Hey, everybody, get in for a picture.
Excuse me, sir.
Can you take a picture of us?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
Everybody say Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
1  What?
Uh, nothing.
I'm gonna go over to there now.
Jake, what's going on?
Why is Amy's hair like that?
Oh, she obsessively braids her hair when she's nervous, and she's super nervous 'cause she's taking the sergeant's exam today.
But Amy loves tests.
Not this one.
It's always been her plan to be the youngest captain in the history of the NYPD, but if she doesn't pass this exam, she's gonna have to wait another three years to take it again, and that'll disrupt her entire life calendar.
Is that a real thing?
It hangs over our bed.
So she's stress-braiding.
Big deal.
That's like a one on the Santiago Panic Scale.
Yeah, but we've also jumped up to level two, creepily singing songs from the Great American Songbook.
You're a grand old flag You're a high flying flag So, yeah, it's a little tough right now, but I think the worst is behind us.
Why are you taking so long to cook my frickin' oatmeal?
Yeah oh.
She'll be okay.
Hey, babe.
Oh!
I see you've taken the braids out.
Your hair looks fun.
Now it's ready for me to braid again.
Okay.
Ames, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but you gotta calm the "F train" down.
You're going to ace this test.
You think that because you love me, and love has made you dumb.
I disagree, if anything, love has made me smarter.
Remember last week when I boiled that egg?
That was big.
I was really proud of you.
Yes, and hold onto your crazy-ass hair because I'm about to prove to you that you have nothing to worry about.
Follow me.
Practice test.
You ace it, you relax, you nail the real one, you become a sergeant, you make grateful love to me for 14 hours straight.
- Jake - Fine, one hour.
15 minutes.
Eight.
- Three but they're mind-blowing.
- I told you a million times You don't really want more than three.
No, practice exams are worthless.
The testing conditions are way too pristine.
There's nothing to distract you.
I mean, look around.
A child could pass the frickin' MCAT in here.
I knew you would say that, which is why I've asked these officers to do their paperwork in here while you take the test.
He writes way too loudly.
She's always yawning.
He has a gross cold.
IBS, IBS.
She has a weird arm-stretching thing.
IBS, IBS, and Hitchcock and Scully with two hours worth of potato chips.
Oh, my God, it's gonna be crinkle-city.
Jake said we get to eat with our mouths open.
What a day!
Babe, take the practice test.
Then you'll know you're ready.
Okay.
See you in two hours.
Sir, a witness just came in with her child.
While she was being interviewed, I took the kid to the soft room, and the toy situation in there is kind of bleak.
Is this your opinion or the child's opinion?
- It's mine.
- Trick question.
Any opinion about toys is a child's opinion.
All we have in there are toys from the movie "Kazaam," and none of 'em are even Kazaam.
I have an extra graphing calculator I could leave in there for the children.
Um, I was thinking we could liven things up in there.
Maybe add a model train?
I used to love 'em when I was a kid.
I was also a model train enthusiast as a child.
Those miniature tracks provided me with some of my happiest memories.
All aboard!
The train will be departing in 45 minutes.
I like this idea, Jeffords.
I'll help you build the train set.
Sweet!
This'll be fun!
I hope not.
It's trains.
Gina, as you know, Great Nana Boyle recently passed.
Yes, I watched the live stream of the plug-pulling ceremony.
Anyway, they executed her will.
- Guess what she left me?
- No.
Her silk bed sheets.
They were very special to her.
She insisted on dying in them.
Don't get jealous.
She left you something too.
Oh, that's so nice of her.
And it's a big jar of brown sludge that smells like death.
Oh, you got the mother dough!
Ugh!
Did this come out of her?
Charles, how grossed out should I be right now?
No, that's the Boyle family sourdough starter.
It's fed us for 140 years.
The bread it births is succulent and firm tang for days.
I hate so many of the words you just used.
Charles, if it's so great, why would she give it to me?
I barely knew her.
You know what, she probably got you confused with my cousin Tina.
He was always her favorite.
Tina is a boy's name?
- Yeah, short for Christina.
- Mm.
You're right, it's pretty gross.
You don't bake bread.
Let me take it off your hands.
Oh, Charles.
Charles, Charles, Charles.
You already showed your cards, baby boy.
You know how badly you want this, so you're gonna have to pay for it.
Gina, please.
No, I'll take $10,000.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
- Probably.
- You don't even want that.
You said it smelled like death.
I thought it did, but now   Smells like opportunity.
- Ugh.
- Oh, God, it really does smell bad.
My eyes hurt.
Ahh.
What are you looking all wistful about?
Just thinking, about relationships and love, and how I'm way better at them than I thought I'd be.
Should I do a TED Talk on it?
Doesn't seem any dumber than all the other TED Talks.
I mean, Amy was a wreck and I fixed her.
The weird thing is, I love her so much, I don't even feel like bragging about it.
- Clearly.
- You get it.
All right, two things.
One, we're out of chips.
- How?
- You skimped us.
And two, Amy left and asked me to give you this note.
What's she say?
She go out to get us more chips?
No, the practice test freaked her out.
She's not taking the sergeant's exam.
-  - Both: Damn it!
- Amy's not in the break room.
- Or the evidence room.
Or the ladies' bathroom.
You know what?
I'll check again.
I've never seen him walk with such purpose.
What a wretched man.
I can't believe this is happening.
I didn't think there was any way she could fail the practice test.
Well, we still have three hours until the exam.
First we gotta figure out where she is.
All right, think.
if you were Amy, where would you be right now?
Oh, uh, boring pantsuit store.
A crossword factory?
A museum of retainers and headgear?
Is it possible to enter the color beige?
All right.
Ooh, I know, I can call her from Sarge's phone.
There's no way she'll turn down a call from a superior officer.
Everybody shush!
It's ringing, I can hear her phone.
She's still in the building.
She's still in the room!
She's in her desk drawer!
Nope.
It's just her purse.
Phone must be in the purse.
That makes more sense.
Phone, wallet, keys.
She didn't take anything with her.
That means she's still close.
Let's go!
Duty Sergeant said she exited this way, and she's not here.
Damn it!
Stop thinking about her like she's your girlfriend.
What would you do if she was a perp?
I guess role play, try and see the world through her eyes.
Oh, no, what if I see my reflection and fall in love with myself?
Jake, we have a literal ticking clock situation here.
Roger that.
Okay, fine, I'll be Amy.
Just know everything I'm about to say, I say with love.
Okay.
I'm outside.
It's 78 degrees and yet somehow I'm still cold.
Better walk on the sunny side of the street.
Wait, did I remember to put on sunscreen?
Pause to think, pause to think.
Yes, I did put on sunscreen, and I bragged about it all morning.
Amy's on the move.
And I'm walking, I'm walking.
GP40 Diesel locomotive with sprung drive wheels, rule 17 lighting, and full underbody detailing.
You're gonna be the belle of the ball.
Terry is your god.
All hail Lord Terry, giver of life.
"All hail Lord Terry".
Check out Jeffords Junction.
It's got a ice cream shop, a '50s diner, and a Mexican restaurant with a sombrero on it.
What happens to the sombrero when it rains?
I see no drains.
Does it just fill up with water until the building collapses, killing everyone inside?
Fun fact: it never rains at Jeffords Junction.
So you achieved this level of lushness through irrigation alone?
I don't know.
I'm just trying to build a fun world.
That's what model trains are all about: imagination.
No, they're about accuracy.
People like to see the world around them exactly as it is, but smaller.
Okay, well, we can have part of the model be very accurate and part of it will be creative.
I'm okay with that.
Yes, yes, as am I. Would you fetch me the 8 millimeter level from my office?
Oh, sure.
Oops.
Gina!
I just want to say, I am disgusted by you.
You somehow lucked your way into a family heirloom, and have the gall to ask me to give you $10,000 for it?
That's an absurd amount of money!
Took me all morning to get it together!
Oh, I thought you were telling me off.
And what would that get me?
Pride?
You can't make bread with pride.
Well, unfortunately, I've changed my mind.
I want to keep the mother dough.
I'm gonna start baking.
I see what you're doing.
You're trying to up the price.
Well, shame on you.
But also, here you go.
An extra $2,000.
You won't get one cent more after this.
Charles, get your chicken leg off my desk.
I don't want your money, Boyle.
- What's going on?
- Nothing, I just realized that I just love old, sour bread so much!
- Come on, Gina.
- Fine!
I put it under my desk and my space heater burnt it to a crisp.
You're a murderer!
Listen, you gotta get over it.
It was just some old bread batter.
It had black spots in it.
Those are sour spores!
That's where the tang comes from.
That's tang town.
I'm walking.
I'm walking and I'm seeing a paper supply store.
I wonder if they have those new summer folders?
Whoa, you're good.
I've definitely heard her talk about those folders.
That's because they have such a fun color scheme, perfect for vacation organization.
This is chilling.
Darn it to heck.
The store is closed.
My bad day just got a whole heck of a lot worse.
Time to go smoke in secret.
And as I'm shame-smoking, I'm seeing  Both: The library.
Captain, did you throw away my sombrero restaurant?
Oh, I might have knocked it in the bin by accident.
I do remember saying, "Oops".
Fine, I'll come clean.
You're ruining our model with your frivolous garbage.
We're building this for kids!
You really think they're gonna enjoy your brown rectangle of dirt with one little house?
Excuse me, this is an accurate facsimile of a mid-sized switching yard.
And it isn't a "little house".
It's a work shed where the yardmen get their OSHA-mandated eight hours of rest between shifts.
So, yeah, I think the kids are gonna love it.
Okay, we have a witness coming in at 3:00 with her son.
Let's split this train set in two, make our own models, and see which one he likes more.
You're on.
You don't stand a chance.
I'm gonna turn Jeffords Junction into the funnest town in America.
That's right, I said "funnest".
Stop dancing.
Stop dancing.
This is a direct order.
Stop dancing.
Of course I know Amy Santiago.
She was here earlier.
She used my phone to call a car service.
But she doesn't have her wallet.
How's she gonna pay for that?
We have a joint account at Brooklyn Town Cars.
I can call them, and they'll tell me where they dropped her off.
She got out here.
I don't know where she went.
That's it?
You didn't watch her?
You didn't follow her with your eyes?
No, that would be creepy.
Well, next time, do the city a favor and creep it up a little, bud!
Let's think, where did she go next?
Let's mix it up.
This time, you play Amy.
She's in that building right there.
Aww, you didn't do the voice.
That's the Department of Records, where her best and only friend Kylie works.
Ah ha!
"Noice".
She signed in 20 minutes ago.
Yet another great opportunity for the voice.
- Amy's not here.
-  Don't give up, babe, you'll find me.
Not now, Rosa.
Okay, so Amy's test is in an hour and we have no idea where she is.
I'm spiraling.
Somebody say something positive.
I cannot believe you screwed this up for her.
I was kind of hoping for something more traditionally positive, as opposed to overtly negative.
And I was hoping you wouldn't lose my best friend.
Starting to feel like you're not a real big Jake head.
Oh, no, I like him, just not as a boyfriend for Amy.
Or as a trivia teammate.
Okay, Kylie, you have gotta get over the trivia thing.
I tried my hardest!
The phrase you're looking for is, "Winter is coming".
No, what Paul Revere said was that the British are coming.
- Come on.
- Yeah, come on.
So what, Paul Revere never said "winter is coming"?
Not even in late autumn?
I still think I was right.
Can we please get back to Amy?
She signed in downstairs 20 minutes ago, but she didn't come here, so where is she?
Well, this is the Department of Records, so I'm going to make an educated guess and say she came here for a record.
Ooh, not sure you're qualified to make an educated guess.
Okay, I know where you're going with this, the Theory of Relativity question.
Uh, he's got crazy hair, super smart, Jewy name.
Eisenberg!
Jesse Eisenberg.
Sit down!
Look, I know lots of things.
I know the names of every Transformer.
Yeah, even the Dinobots.
Grimlock much?
- No.
-  Okay.
I'm not dumb, I just can't handle the trivia pressure.
Anyway, can you please just look up every file that's been logged out in the past 20 minutes?
Fine, but I'm doing it for her, not for you.
Fine.
Trivia Nazi over here.
Yeah, there was a 99th precinct case file from January, 2014, that was just accessed.
Okay, I definitely know where she is.
Like you definitely knew the Serengeti was a type of pasta?
Let it go, Kylie!
Mount Terry's looking good, just add a little snow, and perfect.
Ah, yes.
Now, that's what I call the right amount of arid shrubbery.
Great job, Captain.
That's just what the kid's gonna want, to play in a serial killer's dumping ground.
All aboard the Jeffords Victory Express!
Oh, I'm sure the child will love that you put a steam locomotive whistle on a diesel train.
I'm joking he's going to vomit when he hears that.
- Kid's here.
- Show him in.
This is Dylan.
Hello, Dylan.
I'm Captain Holt.
We have some trains here to play with, like this one that carries coal and rivets, the two main exports of our town.
Would you like to transport some coal or rivets?
Or would you like to come over here to Jeffords Junction, where it's always all four seasons and a volcano?
Do you have guys have any video games?
Okay, I see what's happening here.
You're afraid that you're gonna make Sergeant Jeffords feel bad.
Don't worry, he's a subordinate.
No, just trains are kinda lame and nobody plays with them.
Okay, but surely one of these trains is less lame than the other, right?
No, they look exactly the same to me.
Get out.
Gina.
I just got an email from the council of cousins.
Tina Boyle is contesting the will.
- So?
- So he's coming here right now with an officer of the court.
The mother dough is to be placed in protective custody until the matter is resolved.
Yeah, it's resolved.
I cooked it.
Don't you understand what will happen if they find out?
Gina, they will banish you from the family.
No more Boyle activities.
No Christmas cards, no Thanksgiving cards, no Valentine's cards.
That's right, imagine a Valentine's Day with no cards from your cousins.
Oh, my God.
This is a dream come true.
You think I can get out of all the family vacations too?
Because let's be honest, Charles, Aruba was the worst thing that's ever happened.
-  - How do all 18 of you have sleep apnea?
Listen, we have to do something.
Maybe if we put the dough in the box, they won't check.
Won't check what?
Christina!
How are you?
Great jacket.
Where'd you get it?
You know, I got it at Mervyn's.
Where's my mother dough?
Yeah, about that.
Um, it's an interesting story, what happened with that thing, because Yeah, it is interesting.
- I killed her.
- No!
- I killed her dead.
- No, she didn't.
Put her by a space heater till she was burnt up - to a black lump of coal.
- No, shh.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's right, she gone.
First of all, Gina, I love you.
Secondly, you're banished from the family.
-  - Oh, no!
May I still please be on the Boyle daily email blast?
- Please?
- I'm afraid not.
You'll just get the weekly blasts, like the rest of our acquaintances.
It was an accident, she didn't mean it.
I'm sorry it had to end this way.
Charles, I love you.
I love you too.
But you brought Gina into this family, and you're also banished.
Both: What?
Oh, there you are, thank God.
Hey.
How'd you find me?
January 14th, 2014.
Detectives Peralta and Santiago conducted surveillance from a rooftop at 397 Barton Street.
This is where we came the night I won our bet and you fell in love with me.
- Jake.
- The night that you flirted with me for 20 seconds and I became obsessed with you forever.
Ready?
I'm sorry I freaked out and ran away.
It's okay.
Just because you messed up the practice test doesn't mean you're gonna fail the real one.
I didn't mess it up.
I got 102%.
I found a spelling error in one question.
I gave myself extra credit.
Then why'd you leave?
Because that was the first time it really hit me.
When I pass the exam, I'll actually be a sergeant.
And what if everything changes between us?
That's why you came here?
Yeah.
Things are so good right now.
I don't want to screw that up by getting transferred or becoming your boss.
Ames, I've always known you were gonna be my boss.
I mean, this is your dream, from before we were dating.
And yeah, things might change a little, but for the better, right?
We can finally get premium cable, check out all those shows on EPIX.
Look, you can't be afraid to be successful.
You're too good for that.
I love you.
I love you too.
Wait!
The test.
- We gotta get you outta here.
- Right.
- I'm gonna be a sergeant.
- You're gonna be a sergeant!
You don't have a key for this random roof door, do you?
Come on.
Come on!
Oh, no!
I broke the hotel key I forgot was in my wallet for the last five years.
- Where's Rosa?
- We can't wait for her.
The exam's in 20 minutes.
It's my fault we're up here.
I just won't take the test.
I'll wait three years for the next one.
Oh, no, you won't.
No.
Jake, you are not Die-Harding off this roof.
I am definitely Die-Harding off this roof, for you and only for you, and also for me 'cause I've always wanted to do it.
Jake, come on, get down from there.
It's too dangerous.
It's perfectly safe.
See you in hell, kiddo.
What?
Yippee ki-yay!
Bars, bars, bars!
Oh!
Are there bars on the window?
Yeah, there bars on the window.
I just set up a video game system.
The kid's much happier.
Turns out children don't care about model trains.
Not only children.
I'm beginning to think nobody does.
Kevin, you are not gonna believe this.
Terry put Lo-V IRT Pullman rolling stock on a ballastless track.
I was dying, Kevin, dying.
Yes, you can hang up now.
I guess we're condemned to a life of solo railroading.
We don't have to be.
I know we've had our differences, but through some crazy twist of fate we found each other.
Shouldn't we just be excited that we have someone to share that with?
Not interested.
Good day.
Okay.
Well, I just wanted to show you I got a tiny little train inspector.
It's to make sure the tracks were up to code.
I'll be going.
Wait.
You left your figurine behind for some reason.
Take it.
Wait.
Come on, Sergeant, take the train through the pass.
All aboard the Terryliner.
Next stop, Holtsovania.
Where are you guys?
What the hell is taking you so long?
Did Jake Die-Hard off the roof?
- Yeah.
- But the windows have bars.
Yeah, we all know about the bars, Rosa!
All right, you get to the exam, I'll take care of Jake.
Yeah, don't worry about me.
The important thing is, you go become a sergeant.
Leave me!
I know it's gonna be hard to walk away, but you have to be strong!
She left like two minutes ago.
You're talking to nobody.
Yeah, that makes sense.
This is when the Boyles went to that farm and we all got hoof and mouth disease.
Ah, when we went to that water park, and we all got hoof and mouth disease again.
That was a good vacation.
Sam, Tina, what are you doing here?
Gina called us.
What?
Why?
Because I wanted to show you this.
It's a new mother dough.
Now, I know it's not 140 years old, but I will feed it, and I will nurture it, and it will grow, and eventually it'll be just as sour and smelly as the old one.
What about the tang?
- It will be tang town.
- Tang town.
Now can you just let Charles back into the family, please?
How will we get to this new mother dough?
You can all come by my apartment and take a little piece whenever you want.
- We'll need keys.
- Why?
In case you're not home, or in the bath.
Gina, it's okay, you don't have to do this.
Yes, I do, because you're my brother.
Isn't she great?
We used to have sex, you know.
Both: Cool.
You don't have to mention that every time, you idiot.
Hey.
Hey!
That looks like the strut of a lady who just crushed an exam.
I sure did, and finished 45 minutes early.
Oh, nice, did everyone else give you dirty looks?
So dirty.
How long were you hanging off the roof for?
Long enough for me to take a bunch of pics.
Ah-ha, very funny.
No "soc".
Listen.
I just want to thank you guys for chasing me down and getting me here.
I know it's been a rough day, Jake, but I think I know how to make it up to you.
Three minutes?
Oh, no, not that.
Even better.
Okay, welcome to trivia night.
You said you would never bring him again.
Don't worry, it's gonna be fine, - I promise.
- Is it?
Tonight's first category, by special request, the "Transformers" movies.
Yes!
Question one.
What is the name of the evil race of Transformers?
The robot bad robot.
Oh, God, I don't know.
- Damn it, Jake!
- I'm sorry, I can't take the trivia "presh"!
Why couldn't you have just given me the three minutes?
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
1 I've been going at him for six hours.
He won't say a word.
The guy's a brick wall.
Not to worry, sarge.
I'll take it from here.
Hope you boys brought popcorn, 'cause I'm about to put on a show.
Well, well, well.
I hear you don't like answering questions, Marcos.
That's fine by me, 'cause I'm not asking.
Ooh, handle fell off.
I'll just grab that.
Nope.
So looks like we're locked in.
That's bad news for you, 'cause you're trapped in here with a psycho.
Has anyone tried it from the outside?
Lock's broken.
Gotta call facilities.
Copy that.
No rush.
As I said, I got all the time in the wor It's a little warm in here, right?
Do you feel any air coming out of that vent?
I got nothing.
We got an ETA on facilities?
At least 45 minutes.
And they've checked all this paint for lead, right?
And the room for asbestos.
I feel like I'm sucking on a tailpipe in here, Marcos!
Everybody get away from the mirror!
Come on!
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
Hey, calm down, man.
I'll confess.
Just stop freaking out.
- What?
- I did it.
- I robbed 'em.
- Boom!
And that's how it's done.
I was faking the whole thing to break him.
I coulda stayed in here forever.
Good, 'cause facilities is gonna be a couple hours.
We're gonna die in here!
But in my version, everything is a Transformer except cars.
Oh, right, like some wisecracking biscotti that transforms into a missile launcher.
No way.
Well, it might be hard to do the CGI on the biscotti, but, yeah, I think we could pull it off.
Huh?
No, I wasn't listening to either of you.
Look who's in Captain Holt's office.
Who that lady?
You are looking at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Laverne Holt.
Captain Holt's mom.
The creator.
Widowed at age 39, Laverne Kinnebrew Holt singlehandedly raised two children and still managed to become one of the first black, female federal judges.
Wow, someone read her Wikipedia page.
No, Jake, I wrote it.
- Oh.
- Ah!
Shh.
Okay, the door's opening.
We're gonna meet her.
Everybody be cool.
Be cool!
Santiago, what are you up to?
Just jammin'.
Jam on, jam on.
Okay, never mind.
Peralta, come into my office, please.
- Ah.
- Sorry, baby, but Do you think it was the "jam on" thing?
Yeah, I think it was the "jam on" thing.
Detective Peralta, this is my mother, the Honorable Laverne Holt.
I'm very excited to meet you.
And let me just say, I'm a huge fan of your early work.
Talking about this guy right here.
That was humor, mother.
I know, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
- I love laughing and laughter.
- Oh.
Yes, we all do, but enough chitchat.
Peralta, my mother's house was burgled.
And you want me to cover the case because I'm your favorite detective of all time.
Yes, also the "jam on" incident.
Favorite.
So why don't you tell us what happened.
When I got home last night, I noticed that the window had been smashed, the apartment was a mess, they took all of my jewelry.
I assume they entered through the window, but I don't want to color your opinions.
Too late, but note taken.
We'll stop by later and check out the crime scene.
That sounds appropriate.
Well, I should be going.
Detective, Captain.
- Your Honor, Detective.
- Captain, Your Honor.
Hey, this is fun.
Let's do it again.
Your Honor, Captain.
Humor.
Good day, gentlemen.
Okay.
This is amazing.
Spending time with your mother in your childhood home.
Ah, the adorable baby pictures, the embarrassing stories.
The Founding Fathers Underoos.
There will be no Underoos.
- You went commando?
- That's enough.
- Okay.
- This is a case.
I expect you to act in a professional manner, not a personal one.
I know sometimes it's difficult for you to separate the two.
Ah, you're referring to the fact that I love making everything pro-fer-sonal.
Copyright, me.
Yeah, people love that around here, especially Amy, if you know what I mean.
Wink.
Finger gun.
Perhaps Boyle is still available.
No, no, no, I'll be good.
I'll leave.
Oh, emergency, Hitchcock!
- They're stealing Brown Betty.
- Freeze!
- Get your hands off the couch.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down.
We're getting a new one.
We finally got some money to spruce up the break room.
What?
The break room's perfect the way it is.
It's so comfortable and relaxed.
I can put my butt or feet on any surface in there.
Exactly, it's disgusting, which is why we're fixing it.
I'm open to any and all suggestions.
Two words.
Property Brothers.
And they would say, "Two words, open concept".
So four words, Property Brothers, open concept.
Let's draw from a wide variety of sources, anything from Cameron Diaz's kitchen in "The Holiday," to Kate Winslet's kitchen in "The Holiday".
Is that such a huge range?
Why would Iris and Amanda swap houses if they had the same damn kitchen?
Okay, good point.
Open concept, Nancy Meyers-style kitchen.
Two great ideas.
Let's keep 'em coming.
We could get one of those spot-the-difference arcade games with pictures of naked ladies.
Tapped out at two.
Yikes, Amy.
What's wrong with you?
I blew a huge opportunity to work a case with Holt's mom.
Oh, yeah, I didn't need an answer.
"What's wrong" is a rhetorical question.
Anyway, I don't have time for your sob story, okay?
I blew a tire on the way here, so I have to call a tow truck.
A tow truck?
What?
You don't know how to change a tire?
I am so disappointed.
That is a life skill that every woman should have.
Condescending and untrue.
Why would I do something myself if I could pay someone else to do it?
It's a gig economy, Amy.
Gina, it feels so empowering to use your own hands to change a tire.
Phone, call me a tow truck.
No, phone, no!
Look, Gina, don't call a tow truck, okay?
I will teach you how to change a tire.
You'll be so happy I did.
Okay, fine, but on one condition.
You buy me lunch.
What?
No, I'm doing you a favor.
- Phone - Okay, no, no, no, no.
Whatever you want, fine.
Just let me teach you, please.
I need a win today.
Okay, looks like they broke through this window, rifled through the drawers, and then noticed  this adorbs photo of tiny Holt with a tiny bow tie holding a tiny toy.
That was his first slide rule.
He carried it with him all over preschool.
And then I learned to do trigonometric functions in my head, like a big boy.
Let's continue with the investigation.
Copy that.
The alarm company said the break-in happened around 7:30.
Most people are home at that time.
Is there anyone who knew you'd be out?
The people who were with me at wine club.
Oh my, I just remembered, Carol Spitzheim's house was broken into several months ago, also during wine club.
Interesting.
The odds of that happening coincidentally are vanishingly small.
I would say infinitesimally.
Yes, and I would say teenily-weenily.
We all know words.
So sounds like we should go undercover to the next wine club meeting and scope it out.
You think you can get us in?
I think I can arrange that.
There's one tonight.
Great.
Final question.
Is this little Raymond's macaroni art?
No, that's a macaroni infographic he made about educational spending during the Johnson administration.
Oh, of course it is.
I love it.
Detective Peralta, can I speak to you in my childhood bedroom?
Oh, my God, yes.
Wait, this isn't your bedroom.
No, it's a regular room.
- You tricked me.
- That's right.
My childhood bedroom is for good detectives who aren't embarrassing themselves.
- It is?
- I know you're having fun, but enough is enough with the prying personal questions.
You're annoying my mother.
Are you blind?
We're vibing like crazy.
I assure you, my mother's not a vibrator.
Definitely not what that's short for.
I know her very well, and she would never, uh, connect with someone such as yourself, no offense.
- Rude.
- I'm sorry.
What I mean is she and I are very similar.
- Hurtful.
- All I'm saying is she's not interested in skateboards and soft-water drinks.
I happen to think you're wrong.
I think she and I make a wonderful pair, and we're already becoming friends.
Now that is humor.
Is everything all right?
Yes, we're all done in here, Your Honor.
"Your Honor"?
Don't be so formal.
Call me Laverne.
Oh.
Okay, Laverne.
You got it, Laverne.
Laverne.
Well, I know we're undercover, but I gotta say I'm dying to get a little tipsy at wine club and just dish with my new BFF Laverne.
Hmm, it's cute you think that.
My mother doesn't dish.
It's one of her better qualities.
And you know who else she told to call her Laverne?
The mailman.
The substitute mailman.
Hello.
I'm Judge Holt.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Tyrone Beverton, a Bordeaux enthusiast who sometimes dabbles in the Burgundies, if forced.
And I'm Tank Hendricks.
Moms love me.
Oh, strange detail.
But believable.
Oh, Daniella, these are two prospective members, Tyrone and Tank.
Tyrone likes Bordeauxs, - and Tank is beloved by mothers.
- Yes.
Great.
Could I get your info for our database?
Absolutely.
I live at 100 Charming Avenue.
And Tyrone here is at 328 2nd Street, right next to Ya Burnt Pizza.
Great.
Enjoy your tasting.
Thanks.
- 100 Charming Avenue?
- It's a real place.
I looked it up, specifically to make you mad.
Okay, I'm gonna go find and catch our perp.
Love you, bye.
And that is that.
We have Shui'd the Feng out of this place.
It's beautiful.
Are we better at this than our regular jobs?
Unquestionably.
We should start our own home renovation show.
I can see the poster.
I'm on Terry's shoulders screwing in a light bulb, and Rosa stands by a ladder looking up at us like, "Oh, boy, what did I get myself into"?
- I love that idea.
- Sign me up.
- Shame.
- Shame, shame.
What is happening?
You guys messed up.
You messed up big time!
And worst of all, you're standing here applauding yourselves for it.
- Shame.
- Are you blind?
This place looks amazing.
It looks like a Swedish airport.
Everyone's gonna love it.
Just keep telling yourselves that.
- Shame.
- Shame.
Well, everyone I talked to checked out.
- Any luck on your end?
- None.
Unfortunately we're surrounded by stupid law-abiding citizens.
Check out this guy at the bar.
He's furtively looking at my mother.
Well, let's see what he has to say for himself.
Hi, there.
I'm Tank, this is Tyrone.
He's the son of a close friend of mine.
Anyway, we're new members.
George Kenderson.
I'm fairly new to the club as well.
How'd you hear about it?
I, um I didn't.
You didn't hear about it?
That seems rather odd.
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry, I gotta leave now.
I've got some work to do.
Good-bye.
When it comes to George, I'm getting hints of guilty with undertones of lying.
Oh, yeah, and a strong bouquet of "up to no good".
Wine terms.
And then you release the jack.
And voila.
Tire changed.
Don't you feel empowered?
Yes, there's nothing more empowering than getting a condescending colleague to do a menial task for you.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about how you just changed my tire while I sat here watching a 20-minute video of a monkey getting its hair combed.
But you were paying attention.
- You laughed at my joke.
- Did I?
I like to call this the jack of all trades.
Silly monkey!
Oh, this monkey.
So you really didn't learn anything?
No, but I hope you did.
Can't school Gina.
Gina schools you.
Class dismissed.
Hello, Laverne.
We're not undercover anymore, so I'm no longer your acquaintance Tank.
I'm back to being your close personal friend Jake.
- Okay.
- We have a lead.
George Kenderson.
We ran his name through the system.
He got a parking ticket outside your apartment last week.
We think he was casing your place.
Oh, my.
That is shocking.
I am shocked right now.
And I am enraged.
We are shocked and enraged.
Yes, and we're all showing it.
I'll get the car.
Stay with my mother.
I've never seen her this shocked before.
Jake, I need to tell you something in confidence.
It's happening.
It's dish time.
Okay.
George Kenderson did not rob me.
He was not casing my apartment.
- How do you know?
- He was with me that night.
Doing what?
Oh, doing you.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I mean, way to go.
I'm sex positive.
I don't know what to say.
George and I have been in a relationship for two years.
Raymond doesn't know.
Please don't tell him.
I'm asking you as a friend.
As a friend.
Copy that.
Buckle up.
That car belongs to our lead suspect, George Kenderson.
Lead suspect?
Is that how we left it?
I remember saying, it can't be Kenderson.
Remember, we made up that little song.
Can't be Kenderson, Kenderson is not the one Back to the drawing board, back to the draw - Oh, Kenderson is on the move.
- Oh, great.
There's something so devious about taking advantage of wine lovers.
But there won't be any wine where you're headed, George.
Unless you make it in a toilet.
Toilet wine.
Let's bring him in, Peralta.
- Well, wait.
Not yet.
- Why?
'Cause I, uh  - Mm.
- What are you doing?
Forensics says his prints were all over my mothers' apartment.
Eh.
Nope, nope, nope.
Enough!
He robbed my mother.
No, he didn't.
He's her lover.
He's your mother lover.
He's lovering your mother.
What?
That's not true.
Yes, it is.
I would know if she were seeing someone.
She told me last night.
They've been together for two years.
I see.
And she asked me not to say anything to you.
I see.
So are you upset or just processing or just stopping in the middle of nowhere and getting out of the car?
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Stop honking!
He's going through something!
Hello, sir.
How was your walk?
- Long and brisk.
- Wonderful.
You left me in the car, took the keys with you.
It's still there.
Doesn't matter.
Look, I know it must have been upsetting to find out about your mom's, mm, how you say sex.
No.
Boinking.
No.
Doinking.
Ah, it's too similar to boinking.
I'm looking for the words.
Smashing of stuffs together.
Eh, let's just go with she has a boyfriend now.
Yes, I was caught off guard, but I'm fine now.
- Really?
- Yes.
And don't worry, I understand.
She didn't want me to know, and I will behave in a completely professional manner.
Great.
'Cause she's in your office.
Oh, wonderful.
Let's go talk about the case.
Wow, you are taking this so well.
Laverne Kinnebrew Holt, you're under arrest for obstruction of justice.
both: What?
I know you're sleeping with George.
Oh, come on, man.
Raymond, I can tell that you're upset.
I am because you withheld information from this detective about an ongoing police investigation.
All right, I don't think this is actually about police stuff.
Maybe we should all just take a deep breath and consider not arresting our moms.
Fine.
You're unarrested, mother.
And Detective Peralta, since you two are such good friends, why don't you handle the case on your own?
Good day.
Captain.
Hey.
What is going on in the kitchen?
It's insanely packed.
They're all just taking a break.
Why is nobody breaking in the new break room?
- 'Cause it's a giant turd.
- It's the worst.
It's unusable.
You guys don't even like it.
- Yes, we do.
- Really?
You like those new stools, huh, Charles?
Oh.
Oh.
There we go.
And, Rosa, how was your snack?
You know what really chafes my crack?
We spent years crafting that break room into something special, something comfortable.
A place with so many stains that the new ones just blended in.
Where the couch cushions were so worn down, they comforted all butts, large or small, flat or juicy.
- Juicy?
- Gross.
We built a masterpiece, and you amateurs flushed it down the toilet.
Skir-plash.
Was that supposed to be a flushing sound?
Skir-plash.
- Hello, Gina.
- Ugh!
I knew a truck carrying Khloe Kardashian jeans didn't overturn in the parking garage.
The only thin that's overturned is your decision to not learn how to fix a tire.
Why won't you let this go?
My parents wanted me to learn how to change a tire, and I thought it was a waste of time.
Like any other 16-year-old girl, all I wanted to do was sit in my room alone reading books on U.S. history.
Ugh, every story about your childhood makes me so sad.
Then one day on the way to math camp - Oh, sad.
- Our tire blew out, and my mother made me fix it.
She said I should never be dependent on anyone for anything.
And neither should you.
So we're not gonna leave here until you learn how to fix this.
Oh!
Oh, damn.
Power play.
And very moving speech.
- Thank you.
- One little thing though.
That's not my car.
That's my car.
Same make, same model, but you just slashed a random stranger's tire.
Oopsie!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Ah, hey, Captain.
Whoa, look at that map work.
Sick as heck.
Oh an attempt at flattery.
Well, it won't work.
This was Boyle's map, and it was adequate at best.
Okay, I called some precincts, and it turns out that while we were at wine club, there was an attempted break-in at 100 Charming Avenue.
Oh, yes, the address you used at the wine club specifically to make me mad.
Well, I wouldn't put it that way.
You put it that way last night, verbatim.
And I totally regret that now, and I hope that we can move on, but the point is the only person who heard me use that address was Daniella Andrade.
The mailing list lady from the wine club.
She would give the addresses to her husband, Tommy Hi, Tommy and he would break into the houses while the occupants were out sipping vino.
Okay, case closed.
Great.
So you want to call your mother?
- Tell her we solved it?
- No need.
You can tell Laverne the whole story over brunch.
All right, sir, I'm sorry that I got in the middle of your family business, but I'm afraid I have to get in the middle of it again.
Look, I don't talk about this a lot, but I actually have had a difficult relationship with one of my parents.
Yes, your father.
You talk about it obsessively.
Well, I wouldn't say obsessively.
I mean, sure, there are times where I wish he was there for me more but - Peralta.
- Right.
Sorry, you.
Look, in my experience the best thing to do in these types of situations is just talk about it.
That's not the relationship my mother and I have.
We're not open like that.
Really?
Because you're open with me.
Only because you ask me annoying, intrusive, personal questions all the time.
Exactly.
You need to do that.
Be the Jake in the conversation.
You want me to just say, "Cowabunga, mom"?
Oh, yes, that would be awesome.
Well, it's not gonna happen.
Alas, we are not cowabunga people.
Dismissed.
Once again, I am so sorry about your tire.
Just accidentally slashed it with my knife.
How does that happen accidentally?
It's very common.
I should know, I'm a cop.
Anyway, I will pay for the damage.
Wait, what's happening?
My tire is fine.
It is?
It is!
Of course it is.
Because this is all part of my prank show, "Fake Tire Slashers".
Whoo!
And you have won $27.
And a dime.
There's cameras everywhere.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wondering what happened?
I happened.
Out of the darkness, a hero emerges.
You know, using only my bare hands and also a few tools I replaced that plebe's flat with one of my tires.
You changed a tire!
- You were listening to me.
- Not at all.
I watched a video online on how to do it.
But I will give you this, it was really empowering.
Right?
And you did such an impressive job, especially for your first time.
Oh, no, I had a bunch of practice.
I actually used your car for that.
Thank you so much.
Oh.
You still changed a tire.
Counting this as a win.
Okay, you're right about the break room.
Nuh doy.
Nobody liked it, and it wasn't functional.
Double nuh doy.
So we tried to put everything back the way it was.
We want your seal of approval.
Oh, we'll be the judge of that.
Yes, that's what we're asking for.
It's beautiful.
You even got back the bumper pool table no one ever uses.
Wait a minute, you liars!
What's that nice couch doing here?
The old couch didn't make it.
The second the sunlight hit it, it turned to dust.
Sorry, guys, we're stuck with the nice, clean expensive sofa.
But I guess we'll just have to make do.
Oh, we'll make do.
We'll make do all over it.
Well, I just mean we'll fix it.
Hells yeah, we will.
Should we wake them?
Nah, let 'em sleep.
They earned it.
Daniella and her husband confessed to the burglary and two others.
We've already recovered a number of your items.
Thank you for the information.
Where's Raymond?
Oh, he couldn't make it.
He's attending to some urgent business.
- That's a stone cold lie.
- Raymond?
Cowabunga, mother!
- What?
- Yes.
- We need to talk.
- I'd say that's accurate.
Well, it looks like my work is done here.
I'll just be leaving.
Oh, damn it.
Handle's still broken off.
Uh, just pretend I'm not here.
I'll close my eyes.
I'm hurt that you didn't feel comfortable telling me about George Kenderson.
I didn't know how to.
We're not very good at talking about personal matters.
I'd categorize that as an understatement.
Humor?
Yes, to alleviate some of the tension.
It worked.
After your father died, my personal life was very sad.
I didn't talk to you about it, because I wanted you to think I was strong.
And I wanted you to think the same of me.
I guess eventually we stopped talking about personal matter altogether.
I think it's time we let each other off the hook.
From now on, I'm going to be 15% more forthcoming on personal details and 5% more physically affectionate.
And I will adjust in kind, while also implementing a 12% increase in impromptu communication.
Oh, Raymond.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Oh, this is such a beautiful moment.
Are you guys hugging?
It feels like a hugging moment.
- In the workplace?
- Don't be absurd.
Stop yelling at me.
I saved the day!
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
1 Ugh, where is this guy?
Deal was supposed to go down ten minutes ago.
Stupid criminals have no respect for the people trying to bust them.
Yeah, I really wish he'd show up.
I gotta go to the bathroom so bad.
That's, like, the third time today, man.
- What is going on with you?
- Oh, Amy freaked out 'cause I told her I never drink water so now she's making me drink eight glasses a day.
It's, like, there's water in soda, there's water in coffee, there's little pools of water on pizza.
- That's grease, Jake.
- Well, it's wet, isn't it?
It's our guy.
Billy Ocampo.
Deal's going down.
Let's go.
All right, and then we're gonna pee.
Count.
NYPD!
Freeze!
- Cops!
- We got a jackrabbit.
-  - Ah!
Damn it.
Ocampo got away.
What happened to him?
Dumb-dumb tried to jump down the stairs.
Shattered his ankle.
Foot's all floppy.
Great, let's get 'em back to the Nine-Nine, see if Floppy Foot and his friend know where our man's hiding.
They don't know anything.
They're undercover cops.
Floppy Foot's a cop?
Crap, that's Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.
I know.
She's literally my hero.
Hello, Lieutenant Hawkins.
You idiots just ruined a three-month operation.
My name is Detective Ignatius Pennyfeather IX.
That's I-G Nacious.
These two bozos screwed up a three-month operation.
Well, this sucks.
Lieutenant Hawkins is my idol, and now she hates me.
She is so cool.
She's been buried alive three times.
I've only been buried alive once.
I heard she doesn't let anyone take her photograph so that she can still go undercover.
Hey, Rosa, delete all the pictures you have of me.
I don't have any.
Not even the Splash Mountain one?
Oh.
Here comes Holt.
Well, Hawkins is more enraged than ever.
Why?
Ocampo's just a low-level fence.
She wanted to use him to get to the Golden Gang bank robbers.
She thinks he's their fence.
Golden Gang?
Damn.
Those guys just hit a bank in Bushwick, took 6 mil in diamonds.
That is a big deal.
She should be mad at us.
You two, get in here.
You're in God's hands now.
Good-bye.
You tank the operation, and you put one of my men out of commission.
I am this close to suspending the both of you.
Almost looked like your fingers were actually touching.
We're sorry our signals got crossed.
This is everything we have on Ocampo.
Yeah, we've been on his tail for a while.
We know everything about him, all the way down to his favorite fro-yo flavor Monkeyberry Marshmallow Blaster.
The point is, we can help you find him.
You wanna help?
Stop looking for Ocampo, and stay away from my case.
Sounds good.
We will definitely stop not looking for him.
We're gonna find Ocampo for her, and then she's not gonna be mad anymore.
- Dope.
- Dope indeed.
I swear, I would rather drink ginger ale, Rosa.
Honestly!
Ginger ale!
So a guy got stabbed at 3rd and Union.
You know what that means.
I got 3rd Street bagels!
Wow, it's so nice and surprising - when somebody thinks of others.
- Nah.
- Scully - I was thinking of you.
I was thinking about how stupid your face is.
That's it!
I'm licking all these bagels.
You get none!
Oh, you think your spit's gonna stop me?
Brother, you don't know me at all.
- Mmm!
- Ugh, what are we watching?
They've been fighting like little kids all morning, and I can't get 'em to stop.
I tried everything, ordering them to stop and Well, that's really all I tried.
But I'm their superior officer.
That should've worked.
Guys, why are you fighting?
You're best friends.
Every Sunday after church, Scully and I have dinner together at Wing Sluts.
We know.
You get ribs and White Russians and watch "Undercover Boss".
Last night, Scully said he was sick, so I went by myself.
Guess who was there, healthy as a clam?
Mr. Liar and his new tart Cindy Shatz.
What happened to our bro code?
- Badge before va - Hitchcock, no.
You always get mad when I spend time with Cindy, so I lied, because I didn't want you to throw a fit - Ya cuck.
- You're the cuck, snowflake!
- No, you are!
- Gina, as you know, my fountain pen is being re-nibbed in Germany.
Yes, it's all no one is talking about.
Due to its absence, I borrowed Amy's favorite pen, and I lost it.
That pen is her best friend.
I'm not even saying that as an insult.
I've heard her say it.
How'd you lose it?
I have a COMPSTA presentation coming up, and I was toying with the idea of using hand gestures, for emphasis, so I went out on the roof to practice And, ladies and gentlemen, violent crime has gone down by 10 perce  Amy is going to be very angry, maybe even angrier than when they added "YOLO" to the dictionary.
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.
Amy's, like, physically incapable of being mad at you.
I don't think she'll be disrespectful, but certainly she'll be upset.
Ehh watch this.
Amy, someone lost your pen, girl.
Gina, you better be joking.
That pen is my best friend, and I will straight up It was Captain Holt.
Oh, that's fine.
It's just a pen.
- It's just a pen.
-   Hey, so I talked to my C.I.s, and nobody's heard anything about Ocampo, but I talked to Skeezy J, who said he's been taking night classes.
He wants to be a dietician.
I'm excited for him.
Hawkins knows we're working the case.
I highly doubt it.
What makes you say that?
She just called and said, "Get over here.
I know you're working the case".
Hmm, so it appears you were onto something.
Very good.
TouchÃ©.
Well, off to death.
This place is awesome.
I've always wanted to work in a covert facility.
I know.
We're in a black site, Rosa.
I bet they have some awesome name for it.
- Welcome to the Slaughterhouse.
- Told ya.
Hey, so listen, we know you told us to stop looking for Ocampo, but we figured we'd find him for you, try and make things right.
It's all good.
I'm not mad.
I checked out your files.
You guys do good stuff.
I think you might be our best option at finding this guy again.
You think you can do that?
Can a paring knife remove a human heart - in under a minute?
- Yes, I've seen it happen.
Lucky.
So why don't you both come back tomorrow and we can start working this together?
And, who knows, if you find the guy, I got an open spot on my squad.
Maybe one of you could fill it.
Or maybe one of us could fill it.
- Excuse me?
- What you said better.
Rosa, leave now?
This is amazing.
I've always wanted to be on that squad.
Me too.
Working with her would be insane.
What do we do?
I mean, there's only one spot and the two of us, unless one of us wanted to back off because the other said it first.
That seems fair.
Look, none of this matters if we don't find Ocampo.
Let's just do our jobs, and Hawkins will do whatever she's gonna do.
Doesn't have to be a competition, right?
- Right.
Right?
- Right.
- Right?
- Right.
both: Right.
So based on these phone records, we think Ocampo is definitely still in Brooklyn.
Unrelated question: Is it true you still have a bullet lodged in your hip from your shootout with the Canarsie Killer?
- No.
- Darn.
- It's in my jaw.
- Yes.
This is nice work, guys.
Who figured out he was cloning his credit card?
- Oh, uh, couldn't tell you.
- I don't know.
- Can't remember.
- Yeah, can't recall.
We don't really keep score.
Yeah, we're super non-competitive.
Great.
So what's our next move?
How do we find this guy?
I say we tap his brother's phone.
They're tight.
He'll definitely call.
Jake, you agree?
Yes, I think that's a great idea.
Fully support that.
Totally love it.
The one thing I will say, though, is, it could take us a while to get a warrant.
And we know he's hard up for cash, and we also know that's his primary buyer, so we could see what this guy knows.
Both smart suggestions.
I say we do - Peralta's.
- Yes.
Sorry, it's muscle spasm.
Whatever.
Diaz, you ride?
- Yeah, I got a supercharged R1.
- Engine?
4-stroke, in-line four with dual overhead cams.
Wow, that's a lot of bike.
I ride a custom-6 L-capacity superbike.
What is that?
Like, 180 horses?
210.
Purrs like a puma in heat.
I also ride motorcycles.
Oh, yeah?
What do you ride?
Oh, it's in the shop right now.
Yeah, the torque felt low, so I was like, "Bro, we gots to up the torque".
We all know how it is.
Anyways, I could talk about my steel horse all darn day.
We got work to do.
Rosa.
Sarge, Hitchcock and Scully are out of control.
They got into a fight over the ranch dressing, and now it's everywhere.
-  - I figured it out, Boyle.
They've been acting like kids, so I'm gonna treat 'em like kids.
Ooh, Daddy's gonna dish out some Daddy discipline.
As a fellow daddy, I approve.
- Stop saying "daddy".
- You got it, Papa Bear.
Hmm, I actually kinda like that one.
Makes me feel strong.
Anyway, I'm gonna take away something they love until they stop fighting.
Papa Bear punishment.
Daddy like!
Boyle!
You two, up now!
I'm taking away the thing you love most in the world.
Sitting.
You'll get your chairs back when you apologize to each other.
Fine.
I'm sorry I ever met you, you bald freak!
Don't you push my desk, you basic bitch!
Guys, enough.
Guys - Freak!
- Biatch!
Oh, the ranch.
It's all over the floor.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Ocampo?
Nah, haven't seen him in months.
- I don't know how to reach him.
- Okay.
Then I guess we'll just set up surveillance here full-time.
I'm sure your shady customers will love that.
- Oh, well, I - Tell me where he is.
I'm gonna count to three.
There will not be a four.
Okay, fine, he was here this morning, but I didn't buy anything.
Here, he left this number in case I change my mind.
Uh, thank you.
- Here you go, Lieutenant.
- "There will not be a four".
"Die Hard".
Nice.
- You like "Die Hard"?
- Best movie ever.
Best franchise ever.
I even have the Justin Long one on Blu-ray.
I saw the fifth one in the theaters.
So did I!
Wait, there was only one other person there.
- Was that you?
- Atlantic Avenue?
No, but that would've been a cool coincidence.
I also like "Die Hard".
Really, Rosa?
What's your favorite part?
- The shootouts.
- Interesting.
Vague and interesting.
But it's funny 'cause I always thought your favorite movies were made by Nancy Meyers.
- Seriously?
- What?
No.
- I hate that crap.
- Really?
So you hate the one starring Diane Keaton and John Wick?
- What was it called again?
- I don't know.
- "Something Has to Give"?
- "Something's Gotta Give".
- I got ya.
-  Can I get a trace on this number right away, please?
No need.
We know where Ocampo is.
We got the warrant for Diaz's tap.
He called his brother and arranged a meet-up.
It's about to go down.
So it looks like my idea worked after all.
- Did it, though?
- Yes, it did.
Nice job, Diaz.
Come on, suit up, everyone.
We gotta go right away.
Sounds good.
Maybe we should take our bikes.
Cool idea, but is it the best move tactically?
Yes, it is.
That way, we can slip through traffic.
Totally.
However, as mentioned, my hog is up in the torque shop, just getting torqued up the hog, so we should probably just share one car over there.
Ah, I bet you Floppy Foot will loan you his bike.
And yet, I don't want to inconvenience Floppy Foot.
- Sure he wouldn't mind.
- Right.
Even so, it's not like we have his keys.
- Uh, look at that.
- Let's go.
You found them.
That's fun.
I can't wait to drive this motorcycle that I definitely know how to drive.
Too much torque!
Too much torque!
Santiago, I've been your CO for four years.
By now, you should be able to stand up for yourself, even if that means telling me off.
You're right.
Just say the word, and I will tell you off.
Okay, tell me off about losing your pen.
Oh.
Right now?
Okay, well, it makes me feel pretty annoyed.
- Good.
Go on.
- It grates my cheese.
I mean, it just really grates my cheese.
Grr!
Oh, Santiago, you're faking.
Faking?
What?
Uh, did you hear that "grr"?
Just admit it.
Okay, fine, I was faking the whole time, but I only did it because I wanted you to enjoy it.
That ruins it.
I mean, it's supposed to be good for both of us.
It was good.
Just because I didn't get angry doesn't mean I didn't get anything out of it.
Yeah, but the whole point is for you to get angry.
- Did you even get close?
- Uh What about your last CO?
- Could he make you angry?
- Well, he You know what?
I don't wanna know.
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.
Did you find him?
Where is everybody?
They already left.
Ocampo wasn't here.
He must've heard us coming or something.
- Did you enjoy your ride over?
- I think you know I didn't.
Well, maybe you shouldn't have brought up Nancy Meyers.
Oh, okay, I see what's happening.
This is a competition.
We're officially competing.
- Oh, yeah, we're competing.
- Fine, then it's on, and I'm gonna crush you.
Also, I need a ride.
Can I please sit on the back of your motorcycle?
- No.
- Well played.
Looks like I'm gonna find out if a motorcycle fits on the subway.
Ugh, I gotta find Ocampo before Rosa does.
I'm so wound up!
I can't focus!
Oh, are you flipping out about Tiandra getting kicked off - "So You Think You Can Dance"?
- Definitely not.
Well, you should be.
Her Nay Nay was nonpareil.
I know what's happening.
I'm finally hydrated, and it's unlocking my brain's full potential.
It's too much for me.
I'm "Limitless" -ing.
I don't think water makes you jittery.
It does if it's laced with caffeine.
You dosed my water?
You just drank 960 cups of coffee.
Oh, that esprains why I no talk butter.
Me having stirk?
Good luck solving that case.
-  - Why would you drink more?
My brain wants its fast juice.
Hey.
Why are you in here?
I'm hiding from Hitchcock and Scully.
I can't take anymore.
They got into a meatball fight at breakfast.
They win.
The bullpen is theirs.
No way, Papa Bear.
When Nikolaj and his best friend fight, I have them do an activity together, like a puppy puzzle.
Makes 'em cooperate.
So are you saying we give Hitchcock and Scully a case and make 'em work it together?
No, no, no, we give them a puppy puzzle.
Now let's go to town on 'em daddy-style.
All right, I need you guys to assemble this jigsaw puzzle for a case I'm working on.
Why do we have to do it together?
- Yeah.
- Uh 'cause?
Can't argue with that.
Cooperation instead of punishment.
Damn, Boyle, that is some advanced level parenting right there.
- I learned from the best - Thank you.
- Lorelai from "Gilmore Girls".
- Okay.
I guess being a daddy just comes naturally to me.
-  - Die!
- Hitchcock, no!
- Die!
How's it going?
Ah, I noticed your pupils have stopped pulsating.
Yeah, because I found the perfect antidote to your little prank.
Sure, caffeine speeds you up, but half-and-half slows you down.
Ah, dairy.
You made one fatal mistake.
You forgot how gross I am.
Yep.
Oh, now feels like a good time to tell you I dosed that half-and-half with caffeine.
- Come on!
- What are you two up to?
- Being normal.
Why?
- Not misbehaving.
What?
- Huh, Skeezy J just called.
- Oh, did he pass his final?
No, but he said, "Ocampo's in a warehouse on the corner of Richards and Lefferts".
- Uh -  -  - What's wrong, Rosa?
Out of gas?
Yeah, it got all in my mouth.
It was horrible.
But still not as bad as water.
See ya never!
What's wrong, Jake?
Out of steering wheels?
You know that I am!
That's okay.
I can run too.
Oh, the half-and-half just met the gasoline.
They're not mixing well.
Sir, are you all right?
I failed you, Santiago.
I want my officers to respect the chain of command, but I never want anyone to be so terrified of me that they repress basic emotions.
- I'm a terrible captain.
- Stop that.
You are not a terrible captain.
Santiago, face facts.
I'm garbage.
No, this is about me and my issues with authority.
- You've been great.
- Wrong, I've been a disaster.
I can't believe you would blame yourself for this.
- How stupid are you?
- So stupid.
- I'm such a stupid head.
- The fact that you think this has anything to do with you is insane.
Do you even  Oh, my God, I'm yelling at you.
Yes, you are.
You're in the zone.
- Keep going.
- Oh, okay.
I can't believe you lost my pen.
That was careless and rude!
- And?
- And it was a real jerk move!
- Santiago!
You did it!
- And I am so sick of you playing your damn classical music in your office all day.
It's too loud!
We can all hear it!
Okay, well, this has been You shut your mouth when I'm talking to you.
- Santiago - Right, too far.
I'm sorry.
This is all very new for me.
Son of a bitch.
Where'd you find a steering wheel?
I didn't.
I had a Frisbee in the trunk, and I taped it on.
That's right.
I MacGyvered the donk out of this thing, and it worked flawlessly.
Actually, I hit a ton of stuff on the way over here.
- It was awful.
- Of course you did.
- Yeah.
- Whatever.
This is the warehouse.
Listen, I know we're competing, but We can't let him get away.
We should work this together.
Okay, but the second that we find him We go back to being arch rivals.
No two ways about it.
Yep, I'll boil your flesh and drink from your skull.
Yeah, totally.
I'll do that to you too, if I win.
We're both lunatics.
NYPD!
Down on the ground!
Ocampo, freeze!
What are you doing?
- He went outside.
- Feels like a setup.
I mean, he could have opened the door but stayed inside to trick us.
No way.
This guy is not that smart.
We could split up, follow our hunches.
Winner takes all.
Dummy.
NYPD!
Put your hands where I can see them!
Oh, my God.
Damn it.
You're under arrest.
Also, I'm gonna have to pee while I hold you at gunpoint.
I've been drinking so much water.
Hey.
Before we take Ocampo over to the Slaughterhouse, I just wanted to make sure you were okay, 'cause you are sharpening that knife very intensely.
Makes me feel better.
I'm the same way with "MAD" magazine and "Cracked" magazine.
Ah, they're both so good.
Tough to pick.
I mean, "MAD" is the original, but "Cracked"  They've always got a take.
Okay, I'm done.
Let's go.
Wait.
Look, I know it sucks there's only one spot, but working for Hawkins is my dream.
I mean, she takes down the biggest criminals in the city.
I get it.
Dude, it's just, our captain's a man, our sergeant's a man.
Every superior officer I've ever had has been a man.
It just seemed cool to work for a badass woman like Hawkins for once, but whatever, I'm good.
Also, I spiked your gum with caffeine.
How?
Face it, Charles, we couldn't make 'em get along.
We failed as parents.
Why did I think I knew what I was doing?
Poor Nikolaj.
His life is ruined.
My God, you two are fools.
Your folly was in treating them as children.
Of course, we should've been treating 'em like adults.
No, wrong again.
They're not children.
They're not adults.
They're animals filthy, wild animals and they need to be treated accordingly.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
- But he won't let me -  -  -  You two gonna be friends now?
No?
Okay, fine, yeah.
Who wants a cookie?
Ah, let me hear you apologize.
- I'm sorry.
- Uh, better apology, please.
I'm sorry for neglecting our friendship.
- You're my best friend.
- Your turn.
Well, I'm sorry too.
You're my best friend.
Good boys!
Stay.
Stay, stay.
Eat it!
God, I'm gonna make a great dad someday.
- You got Ocampo?
- Oh, yeah, and you'll never guess where we found him.
In the bathroom not going.
He was hiding.
I ruined the story.
Did he give you any info about the Golden Gang bank robbers?
No, we thought we'd leave that to you.
Well, I appreciate that.
So who found him?
- Who's gonna join my squad?
- Jake.
Thank you, Rosa, for introducing me.
Yes, I am Jake, and I'm announcing that the person joining your task force is Detective Diaz.
What?
No, you found him.
Because you said we should split up.
It was the correct call.
Yeah, but you brought him in.
You won.
Agree to disagree.
I say you won.
- I think you won.
- I say you won.
- Dude, you clearly won - Shut up!
You've got each other's backs.
I like that.
Loyalty is the most important thing to me, so I tell you what I'm gonna do.
How about I'm gonna put you both on the task force?
- Oh, okay, whatever.
- That works, I guess.
It's fine idea.
Not that we really cared.
I wasn't really listening.
What are we talking about?
- Ah!
We got it!
- Ah!
Wait a minute.
Are we hugging?
Have we ever done this before?
No, and if you tell anyone, I'll slit your throat.
- Oh.
- Thank you so much, Jake.
Please.
I'm just glad you finally get to work for a woman as badass as you are.
And as a man, I'd like to apologize - for my gender's history - Don't ruin it.
- Okay.
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink that doesn't have any pills in it.
Sounds good, but I wish you hadn't mentioned liquid.
Now I have to pee.
I promise you I will never drink water ever again.
- Thank God.
- It's the worst.
BRB.
Did you tell 'em anything?
No, they have no idea what's really going on.
Pretty.
See how much you can get me for these, hmm?
Try not to get caught this time.
Oh, no.
She dirty.
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
1 Five, four, three, two, and step.
And step, and knees around the world.
Great form, Captain.
Your calves are looking toit.
Peralta, what're you doing at Razzmatazz?
We needed to talk somewhere outside the precinct.
Diaz?
You are here too.
- Great.
- Yeah.
Sir, we've discovered that Lieutenant Hawkins is dirty.
Her squad isn't investigating the Golden Gang bank robbers, they are the robbers.
- Knees up in the back.
- Sorry, Brenda.
If Hawkins is robbing banks, why did she invite you onto her task force?
And squat and hold and work those quads.
We were working on a case that could have exposed her.
This way she can keep tabs on us.
Turn it.
Get down.
God, why is this so hard for me?
- Do I even have quads?
- And twirl.
Normally, I'd say we'd report this to Internal Affairs - And twirl back.
- But Hawkins is one of the most revered detectives in the NYPD.
- And hula hands.
- If you're gonna go after her, you'd better have the proof to back it up.
Well, then I guess that only leaves us with one option.
And now wag those tails.
Find out everything we can about the squad.
and take her down from the inside.
- Keep wagging back there.
- I am wagging, Brenda.
Morning, Lieutenant Hawkins.
Hey, have you ever considered going by Lady Hawk?
Pretty sweet flick.
Matty Broderick, Shelly Pfeiffer, Alf Molina.
Not to be confused with Alf, Alf.
- We all love him.
- What do you want?
We ran background checks on all the employees of the three banks that were hit.
- Nothing interesting.
- Run checks on all the family members.
Or we could get to know each other better and join you in the field.
Or you could run a background check.
Lieutenant, the manager of the Capital Trust Bank - in Fort Greene is here.
- Oh, yeah.
- Was that bank even hit?
- We brought him in because we think it might be the next target.
Is that standard procedure?
You ask a lot of questions.
She really doesn't.
One time I broke my arm, and she didn't even ask me what happened, and it was a really funny story.
Wow, now nobody's asking what happened?
This is insane.
Okay, I should be back in an hour.
If my desk phone rings, just ignore it.
- I don't answer it anyway.
- You shouldn't tell me - stuff like that.
- Where's Gina going?
That's, like, the third time she's taken off this week.
She has a doctor's appointment.
You know what that's code for.
She's taking a nap in the furnace room.
Is that what you do?
Because you really should go to the doctor.
When you breathe it sounds like someone's shaking - a bag of quarters.
- You're right.
I'll go to the doctor right now.
Sarge, you think Gina will be okay?
She says the doctor's can't be sure, but they're optimistic.
Apparently, she has something called Ansel-Elgort Syndrome.
- Oh, poor Gina.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, you fools.
That's not a disease.
Ansel Elgort's an actor.
Did none of you see "The Fault in Our Stars"?
No.
Why did you?
Teenage romance, dying chick, oxygen mask.
- Checks all my boxes.
-  So what's really going on with Gina?
Wait.
You don't think That she hates work and doesn't wanna be here?
- Yeah, I do think.
- No, that she's pregnant.
It all makes sense now.
Last week, I brought in unpasteurized boar's milk and she refused to drink any.
Not a real convincing argument, Boyle.
No, I think Charles might be right.
Yesterday, I asked her to go for a drink, and she said, "That sounds like a nightmare".
- Oh, Amy.
- Okay.
Just give me this, please.
I'd feel so much better about my self if it was because she was pregnant.
Oh, my God, look what Gina was working on.
"Volcano," "Tibia," "JerHonor," "Concretius," "The Enigma".
Oh, she's lost her mind.
No, look at what the file is called.
BabyNames.
doc.
You guys, Gina's gonna have a baby.
We're clear.
What was wrong with the step class?
Too public.
Couldn't take the risk.
Also, one of us yarfed all over himself after the class.
Yeah, and it doesn't matter which one of us he was.
So what kind of dirt did you dig up on Hawkins?
Nothing concrete, but we think we know their next target: Capital Trust Bank, Fort Greene Branch.
As part of our investigation into the Golden Gang, she managed to get alarm schematics and blueprints.
It's the perfect cover.
She's so smooth.
Oh, yeah, she's a smooth criminal.
MJ, RIP.
The problem is, we're not in her inner circle.
She barely talks to us, and I've been super charming.
So what you binging these days?
What?
Everyone's binging these days.
It's how we consume content.
We need to find out a way to earn her trust.
Normally, I'd say work hard, prove you're good cops, but she doesn't want good cops around her.
Oh, dip.
That's right, Captain.
She doesn't want good cops around her.
We're just gonna have to convince her - that we're dirty.
- How do you plan to do that?
With the help of the sketchiest dude we know.
I am so honored you guys thought of me.
You're not gonna regret this.
So, Adrian Working from home, hum?
What happened to the office?
Couldn't afford the rent.
I'll be honest with you guys, this PI thing is not going great.
Got a couple of bad reviews online, and that pretty much tanked me.
I mean, what does "weird energy" even mean?
- Am I right?
- Well, my guess is that people find you somewhat threatening and erratic.
Okay, yeah.
That tracks.
But jokes on them 'cause I'm having tons of fun with all this free time.
Catching up on reading, going for walks.
It's great.
The other day, I walked all the way to Maryland.
- Gorgeous.
- Well, listen, - we need your help.
- Great, who are we killing?
I won't do kids.
That's a rule.
But that rule is negotiable if the kids a dick.
No, babe, we don't want you to kill anyone.
- What?
Really?
- No.
We need to make Lieutenant Hawkins think that Diaz and Peralta are dirty.
When you went undercover in the mob, how did you convince them you could be trusted?
Easy.
You just take one of their guys and beat him to a pulp in front of them.
Well, that's all well and good, but we're not actually dirty.
We can't just beat somebody up.
What if that someone gave you permission?
Babe, do you want us to beat you up?
Ugh, yes, please.
Anything to feel alive.
I was lying before about enjoying walking.
It sucks, and Maryland is a giant pile of garbage.
Okay, so we beat the crap out of my fiancÃ©.
- And you're okay with this?
- Yeah.
- I just want him to be happy.
- Aww.
You guys are a weird couple, but it appears we have a plan.
Okay, here are the ground rules: You can punch me, kick me, pull my hair, I am a-ok being stabbed, biting and scratching are on the table, - you can use fire.
- These are the ground rules?
Is there anything off limits?
Damn, man.
You got something really sick you wanna do, huh?
Oh, you little pervert.
All right, I like it.
Don't tell me.
Surprise me.
Ooh, this is gonna be fun.
Now remember, if she's expecting, she'll tell us when she's ready.
I don't know how she could keep this from me.
I'm her brother.
I mean, when Genevieve and I knew we were going to adopt, I told her immediately.
- You told everyone.
- Put your hands up, and start clapping for me 'cause I'm gonna be a daddy.
Aww, thank you.
You're gonna need to hold your horses - and respect Gina's privacy.
-  Fine, I will.
What the hell?
Is she drinking coffee?
Boyle, no.
- What're you doing, you psycho?
- What're you doing?
You shouldn't be drinking caffeine.
That can stunt the growth of your ba  - No, no, no, no.
- by, your baby.
Excuse me?
What are you trying to say?
Nothing.
We don't think your pregnant.
Sharon's pregnant.
Uh, that's not true.
God, I hope it's not true.
What if Sharon's pregnant?
Well, it would appear you've figured out my little secret.
We don't know no secret.
You be crazy.
I always talk like this.
Down in Kokomo.
Mm-kay.
It's fine.
You might as well know.
I am with child.
- Congratulations.
- Yes, I'm gonna be an uncle.
I'm gonna be an uncle.
All right, someone take a picture of me kissing her belly.
- Negative, get out.
- Okay, fine, but you have to tell us everything.
How do you feel?
When are you due?
Oh, my God, I don't even know who the father is.
- Who's the father?
- Who's the father?
Well, let's just say he's a destroyer of worlds, - and I am his moon and stars.
- Amazing.
I still need his name, phone number, and shirt size.
I have a fun group Halloween costume idea.
I won't tell you what it is.
It's "Three Men and a Baby".
You're Guttenberg.
Right, well, I would love to give you that info, but there's one little problem.
I signed a non-disclosure agreement, which bars me from revealing his identity.
- Wait, is he famous.
-  - Is it Batali?
- Charles, she can't say.
- Is it Batali?
- Legally, I cannot say.
I'm so sorry, guys, but I can give you a hint, and that hint is: He real famous.
-  - Ooh, y'all are agog.
Textbook agog.
Come on, fetus, let's bounce.
- This way, D-bag.
- Get your pig hands off me.
- You pigs!
- Hey, who's this?
Now who's asking a lot of questions.
Ooh, schnoops.
You said that to her before and then she flipped it on you.
You got flipped on, son.
What did I do?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Really?
'Cause you haven't paid us - in a week.
-  Oh, God, I swear.
I'll get you the money.
I just need a little more  Oh, my God, you really punched me.
Oh, my God, that hurt.
- Are you okay?
- What?
Yeah, this is my character.
I'm a coward.
Come on.
Give me everything you got.
Oh.
Where's our money?
Oh, my kidneys.
Oh, I'm pretty sure I'm bleeding internally.
- Oh, God.
- Get up.
-  - I am so sorry.
Why?
It's going great.
Punch me really hard in the stomach.
Oh, okay.
-  - I think you broke my ribs.
Ah, you're really hurting me.
Please, stop hurting me.
What are you doing?
I said stop hurting me.
What?
I thought you were in character.
No, no, I don't have health insurance.
- This could bankrupt me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just very confused.
Come on.
Get us the money by Friday or I'll break more than your ribs.
Jake.
We're being watched?
Uh-oh.
How many times have I smacked you - in your face?
- Lost count.
And you still have no fear of me.
I'm trying to read your womb vibe.
Exactly.
Knock it off.
The daddy's your Property Brother, isn't he?
- It's a Property Baby.
- Charles, you know I legally can't answer.
Do you want me to have my baby in jail?
All right, no more questions.
Only statements.
You are glowing.
Brother to sister, you've never looked sexier.
- Come on, man.
-  Uh, you guys, I would love to stay and chat about my unborn king or queen, but I just got a text from redacted, and he wants to take me to a fancy lunch at redacted, so I gotta get outta here, but you know what?
I'll be back at redacted o'clock.
Bye.
Okay, so she's going to meet the father of her child, - and it is break time - And you better believe - that we're gonna follow her.
- both: Yes.
The only celebrity I've ever seen in real life was Paul Shaffer.
- It was exhilarating.
- I bet.
Be careful.
Don't let her see us.
Then you should have got a disguise like me, idiots.
Why do you even own that?
I was banned from Wing Sluts for using too much sauce, so I got it to sneak past the hostess.
So far it has not worked.
Wait, look.
There's no fancy lunch.
There's no fancy guy.
She lied to us.
"Redacted" my ass.
What's up?
So not sure if Paxton told you, but we brought a perp in earlier.
Good-looking guy, weird energy.
Yeah, did you get anything?
He didn't know jack, but we surprisingly noticed that there was a camera in the room.
And we really need that footage.
- Why?
- Let's just say, in the course of questioning him, he may have accidentally fallen down - a couple of times.
- He's real clumsy.
If the wrong person saw that tape, they might get the wrong idea.
You know, I saw the tape, and it was shocking how clumsy that guy actually was.
- Right?
- And the funny thing is, I meant to save the file, but I deleted it by accident.
Guess we're all a little clumsy.
Yes, indeed.
I stepped on my omelet this morning.
Not pertinent, let's continue with our covert conversation.
You know, a bunch of us are going out drinking tonight.
- You wanna come?
- You know it.
But I should probably warn you, me and Rosa go pretty hard.
Great.
Bring some coke.
Oh, so you mean, hard, hard.
- Hmm.
- Okay, sweet.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
Cocaine.
Coc-a-ina.
- No.
- No?
Did she take the bait like a stupid fish?
Yeah, she invited us to go out with her gang tonight.
- Nice.
- Speaking of which, Captain, any luck getting coke out of evidence?
One bag of primo blow, as is the parlance.
I still have reservations about this plan.
Perhaps you could say your dealer ran out or he's summering in Nantucket.
No, this is perfect.
If she gets wasted, maybe she'll get sloppy and start talking.
Plus, I mean, I can teach you guys how to fake take real drugs like a pro.
I used to do it all the time when I was undercover.
All you gotta do is close your nostril when you go down.
Watch this.
Oh, nope.
I didn't do it that time.
I got a full snout full.
Whoo.
Okay, no, let me just try again.
I'm a little rusty.
All you gotta do, just close the old nost-a-roni, and  Oh, boy, I got more than time.
Oh.
Whoa, where did you get this?
- Adrian, that's enough.
- Oh.
We can make fake cocaine for ourselves - out of vitamin B powder.
- Ooh, vitamin B. - The second-best vitamin.
- Guys, I'm telling you.
The fake snorting can work.
Watch.
Oh.
Oh, I got so much that time.
Whoa, ooh, anybody wanna listen to Jamiroquai right now?
Okay, I'm just gonna move this away from your nose holes.
Well, you two should get going.
If Hawkins tells you anything, text me right away.
I'll stay here and watch Adrian.
Who's Adrian?
Yeah, all right!
Hey, any of you guys play an instrument?
You know, I play a little bit of bouzouki.
Anybody else play an ancient stringed instrument?
No?
You guys wanna go to the beach?
It's a beautiful day.
Just maybe, like, get out there.
Throw the disc around.
Right?
Hey, have you ever been to the Statue of Liberty, Captain?
Have you?
Have you been inside?
Like, under the skirt?
Like, what's up there?
Did they build a You know what I'm saying?
Oh, guys, watch this.
I'm gonna juggle.
both: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Admit it, Gina.
There was no celebrity.
There was no fancy lunch at redacted.
Well, that's strange because I remember eating lobster-fed beef.
It's the best kind.
The cows live by the sea and they eat only lobster.
- We know you're lying.
- I am offended.
- Nay, outraged that - We saw you eating cheese pizza - all alone.
- Oh, okay, then you caught me.
Gina, what is really going on?
- Immaculate conception?
- No.
Why did you make all that stuff up?
Because I value my privacy, and it's like you guys are always in my business, - specifically Charles.
- Look, it's just that I'm your brother and I love you, and I'm invested, but if that's what you really want, then I'll leave you alone.
Ugh, fine.
I'll tell you who the baby's father is, - but you have to be chill.
- I will be so chill.
The baby daddy is a Boyle cousin.
It's a Boyle!
Whoo!
Ugh, this place smells like Regret?
Failure?
- Ketchup.
- Hey, Diaz, Peralta.
- Over here.
- What's up, Lieutenant?
Cell phones in the bag.
- Why?
- It's standard procedure.
We don't like having phones at parties.
Right, it's like, "Look up from your screens people.
"You're missing out on the best app there is.
- Real life".
- Well, you see, we're gonna be doing a lot of drugs and we're cops, so we don't want our pictures taken.
Yeah, your reason's better.
- Here you go.
- All right, then.
- Here we go.
- Let's get sloppy.
I like it.
You guys, I found out why Gina lied about the non-disclosure agreement.
Because of how invasive and crazy you are?
Oh, Terry, you gullible little rube.
It's because of which cousin it is.
That's right.
I found out which Boyle seed - did the deed.
-  The father is Milton.
Who's Milton?
We're not a part of your family.
He's a total loser.
I mean, of all the Boyle's to bang, why bang Milton Boyle?
- He's that bad?
- "He's that bad"?
Wow, Terry, you are a rube.
Milton's a troll.
Okay, look.
We have to be supportive.
- Gina is our friend.
- Ugh.
Oh, my God, he's here.
You guys try not to puke all over yourselves when you see him.
- Hi, Milton.
- Oh, hey, Charles.
- He's a Boyle?
- Right?
Don't look at his weird face.
You'll make him feel bad.
Hey, uh, have you seen Gina?
You mean ever?
Get more specific, Milton.
Milty!
- Hey!
-  both: Mmm.
What're you doing here?
Thought I would take my warrior goddess - out to a surprise dinner.
- Oh, is the surprise that you can afford dinner since you dropped out of high school?
I left after junior year to be a professional snowboarder.
- Oh.
- And now he owns a winter apparel company that donates snow to the poor.
- Water.
- You're so amazing.
You're so amazing.
Oh, they're dancing now.
Are you guys doing the Lambada?
Hmm, I guess we are.
I hadn't noticed.
Sometimes we just do that.
Aww, you guys make a cute couple.
You're welcome.
Now enjoy watching us leave.
Hey, I had a great idea for a baby name.
- What is it?
- If it's a girl, how about "The Enigma"?
Oh, my God, I already thought of that, and then if it's a boy, it could just be - both: "The Enigmo".
-  Bye, Charles.
I love you.
Bye, Milton.
I love you too.
Come on, Charles, you have to admit, they're perfect for each other.
Yeah, I guess I'm happy for her.
Let's just hope the baby doesn't get his looks.
- What a dweeb.
- Nah, bro, he's hot.
Oh, wow, that's good stuff.
- Who's your guy?
- Actually, it's a woman.
Women can be drug dealers too #lmWithHer.
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.
Not to be snobby, but I got my own stash.
It's the bomb.
Smuggled this vial in on a plane.
Stuck it right up my butt.
- Want some?
- No, thanks.
I'm good with the non-butt coke.
Suit yourself.
Bartender made me my favorite drink.
- It's called a bottle of whiskey.
- I like your style.
You know, when I first met you two, I thought you were pretty uptight.
More like down loose.
That's nothing.
Hey, about the interrogation room.
Don't even worry about it.
Sometimes you gotta do stuff.
Me and my crew, sometimes we gotta do stuff too.
Understood, and hey, look, if you ever need help doing stuff, - maybe keep us in mind.
- I will.
Enough business, huh?
Yeah!
Yeah.
Wakey, wakey.
Rise and shine.
- It's go time.
- Go time?
- What time go time?
- I said I'd keep you in mind.
Remember?
Well, we got a job.
- What job?
- We're robbing a bank.
We always party the night before.
It keeps us loose.
Here are your masks.
Oh, great.
Awesome.
Obviously, we're on board.
Just one thing, if Rosa doesn't eat breakfast, she's a real bear.
Plus, I should go home, take a shower, and gots to watch my "Michael and Kelly".
-  - We go now.
Sure, totally.
Groban's filling in anyway.
Let's go rob a bank.
All right, when we get there we're going in hard, and we're going in fast.
Paxton and I will take the vaults 'cause we know how to use the tools, You two are on crowd control.
Make it clear you're in charge or things could get messy.
Any questions?
- A million.
- No time.
Follow our lead.
Hey, what do we do?
We can't call for backup.
We gave 'em our phones.
We don't have our phones, but we have a phone.
I picked it up at the bar last night.
Oh, my God, you have to tell me more about your blues band, and you guys are all accountants?
That's so fun.
I cannot figure you out, but I love it.
All right, let me text Holt.
This is Jake.
Robbing Fort Greene Branch right now.
Bring backup.
Hurry.
Siren emoji, white hands clapping emoji, brown hands clapping emoji.
- Just send it.
- Okay.
I just received a text from Peralta.
I need everyone in full tactical gear in three minutes.
Move, move, move!
Okay, who says what?
I'll do the "everybody down" - if no one's taken that.
- Shh.
Right, got it.
- Everybody down!
-  I called that.
Everybody down!
It's not as good.
They're already down.
Palms on the floor!
I wanna see your hands!
I also wanna see your hands!
You're taking all the good lines.
Look alive, squad.
We don't have much time.
If anything happens to Jake, I'll never forgive myself.
My last words to him were, "No, you're the man".
That actually sounds pretty nice, Boyle.
Nice isn't good enough, Sarge.
Okay, everyone, be cool, - and nobody's getting hurt.
-  They're almost done with the vaults.
When is the squad gonna get here?
- Peralta, cops.
- Yes.
-  - I mean, oh, no, what a bummer.
The police.
But still, maybe a lesson for all of us that crime doesn't pay.
We go in the front door, we use the wedge formation.
- On my command.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me!
I'm here, I'm here.
Okay, I followed you here all the way on my bike.
- We were going very fast.
- I know.
I'm still pretty coked up.
Let's do this, Nine-Nine!
You are not a police officer.
You're not part of this mission.
Right, okay.
Well, I'm just gonna go in this bank and cash a check.
Whatever happens happens.
Am I right?
Let's do this!
NYPD, hands up, weapons down!
- Put 'em down, now!
- Masks off!
- Let's see your hands.
- Great work, boys.
We're cops.
- Wait, where's Captain Holt?
- Who's Captain Holt?
- I don't know a Captain Holt.
- What?
NYPD, put down your weapons!
- Oh!
- What the hell?
- What is happening?
- We're at the wrong bank.
I'm crashing.
We're NYPD officers.
This is an undercover operation.
That's a lie, Peralta.
You're the Golden Gang.
We've been onto you for weeks, but we finally got you.
Hawkins?
How did you get over there?
- Who are they?
- You tell me.
They're your crew.
They got us, Jake.
It's over.
I've never seen them before.
- What is going on?
- Good job, everyone.
We finally got the Golden Gang.
I can't believe you thought you were gonna take me down.
You are not gonna get away with this.
Oh, I already did, and Captain Holt won't be able to get you out of this one.
Get them out of my sight.
Dirty cops make me sick!
They make me sick!
I'm the sick one!
She's dirty!
I'm clean!
I'm a clean boy!
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
1 People have come from all over the city to mourn.
The grief is palpable.
But the lights from these candles have never shone brighter.
Pizza Rat, dead tonight at the age of four.
Kit.
All right, Haley, thank you for that.
I think it's gonna be a long, sad night for all of us, huh?
2017 strikes again.
Indeed it does.
In other news, we are just days away now from the start of a trial for NYPD detectives Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz.
They were arrested two months ago for a whole string of bank robberies.
The pair are currently out on bail but, if convicted, face up to 15 years in prison.
Yeah, Anna, these disgraced detectives were apprehended after a months-long investigation by hero cop Lieutenant Melanie Hawkins.
They're guilty.
Super duper guilty.
While there is little to no public information about Detective Diaz, Channel 12 has learned this isn't the first time Peralta has been on the wrong side of the law.
We just uncovered cell phone footage from a Criss Angel magic show.
I just want to know how he did it.
He's a mind freak!
A mind freak!
Okay, update on our trial prep.
This is our lawyer, Samuel Miller, who, in many ways, is in charge of our defense.
In every way.
Well, "many" is part of "every".
I'm facing 15 years in prison.
st let me have this.
Okay.
So, prosecution's case is strong.
You two were caught red-handed robbing a bank by one of the NYPD's most esteemed detectives in front of two dozen eyewitnesses.
Right, but can't Captain Holt just testify he knew you were trying to take down Hawkins from the inside?
Unfortunately, no.
Legally you can't testify for your best friend.
- That's not a law.
- No?
- Sam?
- Not a law.
Well, point is, he didn't deny we're best friends.
The investigation was off the books.
There's no evidence proving it even existed.
Doesn't matter anyway.
We don't need your testimony, because we have the meat fork.
What?
Our two-pronged defense.
Not unlike a fork you would use to flip a steak on a grill.
It's a meat fork!
Sam, explain the meat fork to them.
Again, "meat fork" is fun, but under no circumstances should anyone say that in court.
We have it if we need it.
Tell them about the first prong.
We have airtight alibis for the other three bank robberies you all are accused of.
Yes, I pulled time sheets, witness statements, and security footage.
We can show that both of you weren't present at any of the other robberies, except March 12th.
Still not sure where Rosa was.
And you never will be.
Okay, reminder: privacy is cool, but if you don't tell us, we're gonna go to jail for a long time.
Fine.
I was at a "La La Land" sing-along.
-  - Really?
- What's that?
- Enough.
- Just move on to the next prong.
- Yep.
Prosecution claims you stole $26 million, but they can't trace that money to you in any way.
Yeah, I have negative $73 in my bank account.
Ba-boom!
I'm somehow embarrassed and proud of you at the same time.
Yeah, that's my sweet spot.
Okay, so that's where we stand.
Are there any questions or comments?
Yes, there's something I'd like to say.
Don't lose.
Thought that was gonna be longer.
- I loved it.
- It was perfect.
Hey, Boyle.
How you doing there, bud?
I'm fine.
I'm great.
Well, I hear your mouth say that, but the rest of your head is telling a different story.
Feels like the stress of the upcoming trial is starting to get to you.
Oh, is this about my hair turning white?
Yes, definitely.
It's not just the head hair.
It's all of it.
All.
Of.
It.
I get it.
It's like an Eagles concert down there.
Nothing but whites.
Understood.
You got white pubes.
There's no need to stress out.
The lawyer's very confident.
Not good enough.
I need to do everything I can to save Jake.
Charles, you're falling apart.
And that's not helping anyone.
You need to get your crap in order.
Okay, you're right.
I'll take a nap.
I'll eat.
I'll dye my pubes.
You can dye all your hair.
No.
There's no time.
Hey.
Big day.
How you feeling?
Good.
Good.
I was just working on my innocent face.
Check it out.
"I'm a nice boy".
Oh, no.
I don't think that's doing what you want it to at all.
Oh.
Well, it doesn't matter, because my normal face is my innocent face, because I'm innocent.
I know.
I just hope the jury knows too.
Should we talk about what happens if they somehow find you guilty?
That's not happening.
But what we should talk about is how we're gonna celebrate when I win.
I'm thinking we take a trip to Paris or London, Rome, anywhere Jason Bourne has driven a car down some stairs.
Paris sounds fun.
Or we could just go somewhere we could actually afford.
Oh, we can afford it.
Don't forget I robbed a bank.
I'm sitting on $26 million, baby!
Excuse me?
Oh!
He's just kidding.
Yeah, I'm innocent.
You'll see when we get in there.
Nice talking to you, Judge.
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.
I love you.
I know.
Han Solo.
Love you too.
You got this.
You got this.
You got this.
- Charles, you're - In a wheelchair, yep.
My back gave out when I was dyeing my pubes.
I was only halfway done.
I'm like Cruella de Vil down there.
Okay, well, I need to go be on trial for bank robbery now, so maybe we can talk about this later?
Oh, right.
Good luck.
Good luck to you.
- About the - Yes.
Thank you.
Okay.
Psst!
Hey, Jake.
I got you.
Don't worry about it.
Really?
How?
Among my many, many, many skills, I'm fluent in face.
I can tell you what the jury's thinking at any given moment.
I see an eyebrow twitch, I'm like, "Oh".
If their cheek has a certain tension, okay, that leads me a different way.
Watch this.
Scully, you're wondering if anyone can smell your fart.
The answer, my brother, is yes.
She's a witch.
What'd I tell you, boy?
Trust me.
- I got you.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I like your stupid courtroom clothes.
Thanks.
I like your stupid courtroom clothes.
Thank you.
You know, if you had asked me back at the Academy where I wanted to be in 12 years, I definitely would have said right here.
Same.
Great.
So it all worked out.
End of story.
All rise for the honorable Judge Marinovich.
Please.
You may be seated.
Court is in session.
Now, Miss Crunder, you were in the bank at the time of the holdup.
Did you see the robbers' faces?
Plain as day.
They're sitting right there.
Let the record show, she's pointing at Jake Peralta and Rosa Diaz.
Okay, the jurors found that super compelling.
Just an update.
Thanks, Gina.
So, like, you're not making a good first impression.
Right.
Thank you.
No doubt.
Hey.
Don't worry.
We got this.
We still have our alibis.
We weren't at the first three robberies.
Sure, they weren't at the first three robberies.
But that's just so they'd have airtight alibis.
Uh-oh.
They were only at the last robbery 'cause we were short on manpower.
Our other two guys disappeared.
I think those bastards killed them.
- Come on.
- What?
Objection.
Conjecture!
Sustained.
Sorry, you say it.
Sustained.
We both sounded equally authoritative.
Prong one's not looking so great.
Well, that's why we have second prong.
They can't tie us to the money.
Just this morning, my team uncovered two accounts from the Cayman Islands controlled by Diaz and Peralta containing $26 million between them.
It's okay.
She has no proof.
These are the original applications for the accounts signed by Diaz and Peralta.
This is the affidavit from the bank manager identifying them as the owners of the account, and these are the deposit slips for the entire amount.
Oh, no.
Rosa, we don't have any more prongs.
We're prongless.
Oh, and one more thing.
They're guilty.
No, we are not.
Please don't address the jury, Mr. Peralta.
But but but One more "but," and you will be in contempt.
"One more 'but' and you're contempt," name of your sex tape.
Okay, I know it looks bad.
But it also looked bad for Liam Neeson in "The Grey".
He got torn up by wolves in that movie.
That's how it ends?
Oh, man.
That is depressing.
Why would someone make a movie about that?
Okay, here's how the jury's feeling from left to right, L to  not a fan of Jake, not of a fan of Rosa, not a fan of me, bathroom incident We get it.
They all hate us.
In toto, yes.
Some good news.
I spoke to the judge, and he's giving us an extra day to review the new evidence.
What are they gonna find in one day?
Face it, man, we are going to jail.
We might as well start hiding razor blades under our tongues.
Here.
You can have one of mine.
How long has that been in there?
- Since grade school.
- Yeah, that checks out.
No one's going to jail.
We're gonna work this case, and we're gonna find something.
You're not gonna sit back and resign yourselves to your fates.
You're gonna take action.
Now, Hawkins can destroy your alibis and put money in your accounts Wait, sir.
I think Hawkins just made her first mistake.
What are you talking about?
Well, the money that she put into our accounts didn't just appear out of thin air, right?
Right.
It was transferred in from somewhere.
We just have to trace it back to its source.
Which would be Lieutenant Hawkins.
But those are offshore accounts.
We can't subpoena them.
So we need to break in to the bank's computers.
We need a hacker.
Does anyone know a hacker?
Boyle does.
I'm Boyle!
I get to help!
Oh, my God.
I can feel my legs again.
I can walk.
Yes!
It's a miracle kind of.
See?
When the Nine-Nine puts our brains together, we can achieve anything.
Hey, we should team up and rob banks for real!
You should stop talking in the hallway.
Yep, copy that.
Nice to see you.
Okay, Boyle, tell us about your hacker.
Okay, he goes by the handle "Pandemic," and there's not a network he can't crack.
He's a phantom, a ghost.
And only I know where to find him.
Welcome to Hey, Hey, It's Wednesday's!
, where it's never the weekend.
Be right with ya.
Are you sure about this hacker, Charles?
I'm not getting a strong "Mr. Robot" vibe from this place.
Yeah, that's because the only thing Pandemic loves more than hackin' computers is hackin' into a big old fried onion.
Oh, there he is.
Hey guys, welcome to the Quarantine.
Help yourselves to some potstickers.
Best eaten when hot.
No thanks.
Here are the account numbers for the bank where the money showed up.
Now, we're in a real hurry.
You think you can trace it back to its source?
Are you questioning my abilities?
Watch this.
What's your name?
- Why do you need - Terrence Vincent Jeffords.
Wait.
What's happening?
You're getting hacked, bro.
That's what's happening.
- Don't do that.
- I'm in your home computer.
You are?
Get out.
You got a lot of songs by Natalie Imbruglia.
Uh, I bought those back in the '90s.
Nope.
Downloaded on Thursday.
Okay, now watch the Pandemic spread.
There's a document in here that looks to be fan fiction for the show "Madam Secretary".
Oh, Sarge, I didn't know you were a fan of the Madam.
The show leaves Terry wanting more.
I'm just filling in the gaps!
Now get to hacking.
Guys, I think I found something.
Is it my heart medicine?
My doctor said that if I miss even one dose, I could have a massive stro No, Scully, this is important.
I was going through the arrest reports filed by everyone in Hawkins' squad.
We already went over these.
Right, but there was one guy we didn't flag because he was never the arresting officer: Detective Matthew Langdon.
I think something went down between him and Hawkins.
Well, he had a stellar 14-year career Before joining Hawkins's squad.
Then, three months later, he quit the force entirely.
He didn't just quit.
He disappeared.
No tax records.
No known address.
His wife filed a missing persons report.
But after doing some incredible sleuthing, I think I figured out where he is.
Ames, how would you like to take a romantic trip to the town of "Horseditch, Pennsylvania"?
Ooh.
The Paris of the mud belt?
Oui, oui.
Wee-wee.
Anyway, it's huge stakes.
We should get going.
Good luck.
Has anyone seen Diaz?
She's supposed be looking into the first two bank robberies.
I saw her outside the courthouse.
She gave me her jacket and her motorcycle helmet.
Why would she give you her favorite jacket?
Because I'm a rebel, and we're in love.
Doi.
Diaz, I've been calling you.
Why weren't you answering your phone?
Don't have it.
I charged it and stuck it on a truck headed west.
What's with the suitcase?
- Going to Malaysia.
- You're going to Malaysia?
No, the suitcase is going to Malaysia.
I'm getting on a bus to Florida.
What's in Florida?
Airport.
I'm flying to Argentina.
- This is very complicated.
- Thank you.
Adrian has a ranch in the Andes where he goes when he's on the run.
He's already there, getting rid of the scorpions.
adding more scorpions.
I don't know.
The reception was real bad.
Diaz, I know you're scared, but things are starting to turn around.
We're on the money trail, and we just found a new lead.
With all due respect, sir, both you and I know that none of that is gonna pan out.
And you said yourself I should take action.
So I am, in Argentina, surrounded by scorpions.
Or not surrounded by scorpions.
I'll find out when I get there.
Look.
I know you're innocent, but fleeing the country is a crime.
I could arrest you right here.
Do it then.
I didn't think so.
The mortgage is paid off.
You can give the place to whoever you want.
I don't care.
Actually, I do care.
Don't give it to Hitchcock.
I'll have the Mid-Week Potato Leak soup, and he'll have a "There's Work Tomorrow So Be Cool Frozen Margarita".
Who are you?
You can call me Nightmare.
But for check writing purposes, it's Jennifer Huggins.
The bank's encryption turned out to be more secure than I thought, so I had to bring in a friend.
Just tell us if this is impossible.
We don't have a lot of time to waste, and we've been here, like, five hours already.
Huh.
You don't think I can do this?
Is it because I'm a woman?
No, no, I didn't say that.
- I think women are amazing.
- Thank you.
And now I'm about to hack your world into pieces, old man.
That'll show you.
No.
Just do the thing with the bank.
- That'll show me.
- Whoa.
Looks like someone was a catalog model in Japan.
Whoa!
Those boots.
That slicker.
The no pants.
Who's the target audience for these pics, Sarge?
I was a starving student.
Terry needed the yen!
Babe, are you sure we're in the right place?
This looks like where they shot "The Village".
Amy, don't say things like that.
You're gonna scare me.
You know that.
I think Langdon's wife's been secretly visiting him.
She posted a photo in March of a snowstorm, but there was no snow in New York.
The picture was geotagged right here.
"Flaxton Hill Farms".
Check it out.
There's a car in the driveway.
Somebody's home.
Matthew Langdon?
Are you there?
We'd like to talk to you about Melanie Hawkins.
-  - Whoa!
Don't shoot!
But seriously, don't.
Don't shoot.
If I were you I'd turn around and start walking.
Because in about three seconds, I'm gonna start shooting.
-  - Oh, God.
He did the gun cock.
This is escalating much too quickly, and three seconds is not enough time - Jake - Right, focus.
Sorry.
Sir, we know you worked with Hawkins.
Did she send you here?
- No.
- No.
We're not with her.
We're like the opposite of that.
She set me and my friend up.
We could go to jail.
Why should I believe you?
Look, if you let me slowly reach into my jacket pocket, there's an article open on my phone that will explain everything.
That's a video of a monkey humping a frog.
- What?
Oh.
That's my bad.
It was a long ride up here, and I got bored.
Here.
Close that tab.
That's the article.
Hawkins ran you out of New York and took away your life.
If you help us, maybe we can help you get it back.
Fine.
I'll talk to you, but you gotta follow me; I gotta go feed the hogs.
Oh, my God, what are you gonna feed them?
Is it us?
Corn.
Hmm, corn.
Maize, as there was at the first Thanksgiving.
- Jake.
- Right.
Let's go talk.
All right, guys.
Let's order a round of "Hey, Hey, It's Light Beer, Light Beer" and get into it.
Um, who is this guy?
These offshore banks are incredibly secure, so we needed more manpower.
But what makes you think that he would be Charles, don't talk.
Do not challenge this very capable gentleman in any way.
Just let him get to work.
Okay, thanks.
So you understand we're not questioning your ability at all.
Of course not.
But I don't know you guys, so just to be safe, I did dig up some dirt on you to use as blackmail in case things go south.
On both of us?
- Just Terry Jeffords.
- Yup.
Or should I say Sir-Dance-Alot?
Oh, come on!
Turn the volume up!
Mommy can't hear us in Da Bassment.
Oof.
at's embarrassing.
Sarge, you gotta scrub-a-dub-dub that profile.
Oof.
It's pungent out here.
It's so weird how food smells so good but farms smell so bad.
Yeah, I think that every day.
So Hawkins?
I caught her taking payoffs from a gang leader.
When I confronted her about it, she said I could disappear or she'd kill me.
I see why you chose pig farming.
It's better than death.
Not during the spring thaw.
Why?
Does it smell even worse somehow?
I was talking about the noises.
It's pig mating season.
What does that sound like, a bunch of wet bagpipes?
That's exactly it.
- Oh.
Nailed it.
- Hey.
Yeah.
The worst part about it is, I had to leave my wife behind.
If Hawkins knew we were still together, I'm afraid she'll kill her.
If you testify to this in court, it would back up everything Jake and Rosa are saying.
It could sway the jury.
You could take Hawkins down and get your life back.
I've tangled with her enough to know that she always wins.
So it's a no.
Come on.
You're our last chance.
I can't help you.
That's final.
Oh, my God.
Is this seat taken?
You really gonna do this, Diaz?
My name is Rachel Weinstein.
I am a graduate student on sabbatical to study birds at the University of Buenos Aires.
You know, Cornell has a far better ornithology department, and it's right here in New York.
Cornell has accused me of robbing a bank and is gonna send me to jail for 15 years.
I guess we're dropping the metaphor.
I don't know why you're here.
You're not gonna change my mind.
I know.
I just wanted to say good-bye.
Okay.
Good-bye.
I hope you know your family's gonna miss you.
I don't care.
I barely speak to them.
I was talking about the Nine-Nine.
Be safe, Rachel Weinstein.
I guess now we have to actually talk about what happens if the jury finds me guilty.
They still might not.
We could still go to Paris.
Forget Paris.
Billy Crystal.
Nailed it.
I'll wait for you.
And I'll keep fighting for you and so will everyone at the Nine-Nine.
We'll do whatever it takes.
I love you.
I love you.
Okay.
- Let's go back to New York.
-  -  - You can choose the music.
Just put on anything by Enya.
No, not anything.
"Orinoco Flow".
On repeat.
Okay.
Wait.
I'm coming with you.
You are?
You'll testify?
Hawkins has cost me and my wife too many years of happiness.
I'm not gonna let her do the same to you.
Thank you so much.
Well, I'm gonna grab my stuff, and I'll get a few CDs.
Hope you like Enya.
Matthew Langdon, you and I are vibing so hard!
Where are Jack and Rosa?
I don't know.
I'm getting worried, because the jury's getting restless, especially juror number 4.
She'd rather be in Lake Havasu with her new boyfriend, Derek.
I didn't get that from her face.
I was eavesdropping by the vending machine, so I just got a text from Peralta.
- He's a few minutes away.
- And Diaz?
Perhaps a bit more than a few minutes away.
- I think there's a chance - I'm here!
Sorry, traffic was a nightmare coming back from Philadelphia cheesesteak restaurant.
They do breakfast.
It checks out.
Okay.
So what happened?
I guess I wasn't ready to say good-bye to my family.
Good.
Neither were we.
Now what I'm picking up on is just a genuine moment of friendship and respect.
And now I'm feeling like you wish I would stop analyzing you 'cause I'm ruining the moment.
But you guys are so cute.
I love you.
All rise for the honorable Judge Marinovich.
Please, be seated.
The court is in session.
Counselor, where is Mr. Peralta?
Objection!
- Mr. Peralta, what is the meaning of this?
Your Honor, I'd like to call a surprise witness.
You're not an attorney.
Right.
Sam, call a surprise witness.
Okay.
Uh We'd like to call a surprise witness.
The jury's like, "Oh, snap, a twist".
Like, they love twists.
Any great trial has a twist.
I'm getting worried.
We're running out of time.
It's fine.
This place is open 24-5.
Only closed on weekends.
Such a strange theme for a restaurant.
Agreed.
But that's not what I meant.
Did you guys find anything yet?
Yes.
Terry made a sizable purchase at an Etsy store that sells anklets for men.
- Sharon thinks they're sexy.
Oh, come on!
Focus on the case, man.
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm in!
Can you state your name for the record?
My name is Matthew Langdon.
Mr. Langdon, do you know Melanie Hawkins?
Yes.
I worked for her for three months in 2010.
- And you are a retired -  - NYPD detective, correct?
-  Yes, I served for 14 years.
Gotcha!
Sorry.
Proceed.
The money that was deposited was routed through five banks.
Now, I can't link it to Hawkins, but the original transfer came from this shell corp.
- Huh.
- Doesn't ring a bell.
I'll text the squad, see if anyone recognizes it.
"Flaxton Hill Holdings".
"Flaxton Hill"?
Oh, no.
Flaxton Hill Farms.
Jake!
Jake!
Jake!
This was a mistake.
We have to get Langdon off the stand now.
What?
Why?
And how would you describe the Lieutenant?
He works for Hawkins.
He put the money in the accounts.
Oh, no.
Melanie Hawkins was the most honorable cop I ever worked with.
And the only reason that I'm here is because of that man, Jake Peralta.
He offered me $300,000 to lie and say that she set 'em up.
Okay, okay, this is bad.
This is really bad.
But just remember, we are not going to jail.
We didn't do it.
We're innocent.
Guilty.
-  - On all charges.
Oh.
Guilty.
Very cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool.
Fremulon.
- Not a doctor.
- Shh!
