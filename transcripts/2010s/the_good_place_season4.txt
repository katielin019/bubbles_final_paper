{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 - - Michael designs the new neighborhood.
The Bad Place gets to choose the four new humans.
The other residents will be Janet Babies.
You know, if we pooled our resources, we could be done in two shakes of a lamb's Derek.
Thanks, Derek.
When you fail, the four humans will be tortured for all eternity.
But guess who's going to be doing the torturing?
We built a Michael suit.
I can't do it.
It's too scary.
Hi, John, I'm the architect.
Come on in.
The Bad Place didn't pick the worst people.
They picked the people who would be the worst for us.
You need to erase my memory and reboot me.
Hi, Chidi, I'm Eleanor.
Come on in.
Wow!
Just wow!
It's perfect.
Everything is just perfect.
I am so, so happy.
I'm glad you like it.
It's so quaint it feels cozy, but also vibrant and limitless.
I can't believe how how utterly, completely, 100% perfect everything is You know, let's keep this moving.
Oh, yeah, sure.
Here is your new home, complete with two of your favorite things: floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and Reading lights!
I love reading lights.
They are great for reading.
And, oh, check this out.
Um, hold out your hand.
And think about a book.
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
I can summon philosophy books like Thor's hammer.
This is literally my number one dream.
Also ow!
That hurt.
Well, I have a lot to attend to.
Um welcome to the Good Place, Chidi.
Thank you so much.
Ah and I'm I'm sorry.
This has been so overwhelming, I-I forgot your name.
- Eleanor.
- Eleanor, right.
Sorry.
Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.
Now I'll never forget.
Well, you might!
Okay, can we not Oh, Eleanor, you did a brave thing and I am embracing you and I shall not let you go.
And I'm also embracing you because this feels warm and my hands are cold.
Guys, I'm good.
Honestly.
Wasn't even as bad as I thought.
I mean, who cares if he doesn't remember my name?
Oof I mean, cool.
Good save, bud.
Let's just concentrate on the next resident, who gets here in six minutes.
Wait.
I need to say something.
I know this seems bleak and it feels like we're all doomed and therefore humanity is doomed.
You needed to say that?
The point is, I believe that we're destined to succeed.
There is nothing that the Bad Place can throw at us that we can't handle, because we are an incredible, inspiring, brilliant group of Supercharged, d-bag, ass-wiping maniacs.
I mean, look at you.
I am so proud of how disgusting and cruel you all are.
You suck.
You all suck donkey butts.
Tahani so, so smart, and sophisticated.
She was the only one who was able to talk me out of that goatee.
Well, I lost that battle with Robert Downey Jr., and I'll be damned if I lose it with you.
Bambadjan such an unbelievable dingus.
And Val.
Who's a bigger skidmark than Val?
Maybe your mom.
Classic.
We have Janet, who can do literally anything.
She made all the other people in the neighborhood.
- Not people.
- We have me, who had a momentary setback, but I'm feeling great now.
And that was awhile ago.
Most of you don't even remember it, probably.
We have Jason, who can And marching us into battle, our fearless leader, the pride of Phoenix, Arizona, Eleanor Shellstrop!
- Yay, Eleanor!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Technically, the pride of Phoenix is a life-size statue of Alice Cooper made from cigarette butts.
It's outside City Hall.
But thank you for the kind words.
With this team, there's no problem we can't solve.
There is no problem we can't create.
And believe me, we are gonna create some a-problems.
So let's kick things off with our official Bad Place song.
1-877-KARS for Kids K-A-R-S, Kars for Kids - Ooh, are we singing?
- Shut up, Glenn.
I think you look great.
Professional, serious.
A proper team leader.
It does make me feel authoritative, like that chick from "Law and Order".
Well, boys, looks like we got ourselves an SVU.
I've never seen the show.
-  - Okay, who we got next?
Linda?
Come on in.
So you, Linda Johannsen, are in the Good Place.
That's nice.
I know this can be a little overwhelming, but you'll get used to it.
Do you have any questions?
Is there a fitness center?
There can be, plus literally anything else you could possibly wish for.
Just in case we weren't clear, this is the Good Place.
A state of eternal happiness.
Paradise.
That's nice.
I like that.
So the Bad Place sent Simone to mess with Chidi, John to mess with Tahani do you think they sent Linda to mess with Jason?
She's from Norway is Norway, like, the opposite of Florida?
All I know is she's boring.
She makes Neutral Janet look like Disco Janet.
Disco Janet was around for awhile, years ago.
She was great.
I mean, she was a lot, but she was fun.
Actually, that's a good idea.
Let's unload this dead weight.
Janet?
- Hi, there.
- Linda, this is Janet.
If you want anything at all, Janet can bring it to you.
Watch.
Janet, can I have a baby elephant made of pure light that tells you true secrets about the universe?
-  - Shirley Temple killed JFK.
See?
Anything you want from Janet?
Can I have a peppermint?
Sure.
I'm gonna go over there now.
Stonehenge was a sex thing.
Brent?
Come on in.
So you, Brent Norwalk, are dead.
Really?
Well, that blows.
Ah, you know what, maybe it's a good thing, actually.
Some journalist was poking around, calling all these ladies who used to work for me.
You can't even make a joke these days!
Everything is so PC.
And I was an equal-opportunity offender, okay?
I made jokes about everybody, and by the way, I'm the furthest thing from racist.
My dentist was a black woman.
I just think people need to loosen up.
So, where am I, exactly?
- The Good Place.
- Oh, cool.
Good.
So, Brent, I see from your file you were in the materials business.
Oh, yeah, big time.
Strings, chords, vinyl, synthetics, rubber we do vulcanized now, so that's huge.
Plus metals aluminum, brass, copper what else - Steel?
- No, not steel.
Steel's a sucker's game.
Polymers, coatings, internals you crack open an HVAC?
That is all us.
Is there golf here?
There freaking better be.
Okay, well, why don't you explore around a bit while I go far away and if you need anything, you can always ask Janet.
Janet?
-  - Hi, there.
How can I help you?
Oh, a secretary.
Great.
- Not a secretary.
- Fine, fine.
Executive assistant.
Here we go with all the terms we gotta learn, right?
Vice-president of helping.
Captain Marvel.
You know what I'm saying.
Oh, I'm not part of this.
Let me show you around.
Well, Linda must be here for Jason because Brent is definitely here to annoy the fork out of me.
Everyone, you may remember Matt from accounting.
The Judge has assigned him to our project.
So I'll be monitoring the four new humans.
A modified point system will be applied to their actions for the next year, and then we'll know how much better or worse their behavior is than when they were alive.
But no one will be able to see what's happening in real time.
Good luck saving humanity from eternal doom.
Okay, forget about all that stuff.
For this first week, all we need to do is figure out what the fork is up with these benches.
So, I made this.
We start 'em out on this side, because we're like, "What's her deal"?
And when we feel we have a handle on who they are, what makes them tick, we move them to this side party time.
We already know a lot about Simone so boom, see?
One down, three to go.
Let's go figure out the others.
We can do this.
On three.
Dead eyes, eat hearts, can't lose.
Ah, sorry.
Old Bad Place rally cry.
Aww, aww.
Janet!
He's walking around again.
Yeah, I see that.
Derek, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to stay at Mindy's.
I can't help it.
I'm just such a proud daddy Derek.
I mean, will you look at all these beautiful babies that we made?
She made them, dude.
You barely did anything.
Probably just, like, made all the butts.
I did make all the butts.
I made that butt - I made that butt - Right.
- I made both those butts.
-  Derek, you have to stay at Mindy's house.
What if one of our new humans sees you and starts asking questions about the weirdo in the tux?
Say no more, but before I leave, can I have a hug in celebration of everything that we created?
- Okay.
- Aww.
That feels so Derek.
Oh.
You are all, simply put, good people.
The point of the video is to make them all confront what kind of people they were on earth.
Keep a close eye on our four subjects.
Try to gauge their reactions, you know?
The subtlest glances, the tiniest flinches.
What about shaking someone by the head?
What does that mean?
Oh, boy.
Hey, Simone, everything okay?
Yeah, well, no well, actually, it doesn't matter.
None of this is real.
Sorry?
I'm a neuroscientist, so I get what's going on here.
You know, clearly, I was in some kind of horrible accident, I'm on my deathbed, and this entire thing is just a hallucination constructed by my damaged brain as it slowly shuts down.
It's not real, so I'm just gonna wander around until I wake up or die.
See you later, figments of my imagination!
She's just gonna go get some popcorn from the river.
There's a popcorn river.
I'll show you guys later.
Uh, she said keep going without her, so let's roll it.
Janet, make a popcorn river.
Everyone else, meet at Mindy's in ten minutes.
Well we're off to a fantastic start.
I wish I could stay and help, but this system is so complex that if I lose concentration for even one billionth of a second, the entire neighborhood could collapse in on itself like a dying star.
Also, Brent wants a BLT.
Simone's reaction is fairly common.
When I worked in the Bad Place, some people just wouldn't believe it when they heard they were dead.
How did you convince them?
They'd usually come around by the third or fourth day of mouth fleas.
Obviously not an option here.
But, if Simone doesn't think this is real, she definitely won't become a better person.
Who can convince her that this actually is the afterlife?
We need someone authoritative and reassuring, like Nelson Mandela or Sir Patrick Stewart or really any of my old racquetball partners would do.
Oh, I know who it should be.
If you say Blake Bortles, - I'm gonna slap you a lot.
- Chidi!
I believe everything Chidi ever tells me because of his brain and how he looks like one of those owls that graduated from college.
Of course.
Time to activate our ethical sleeper agent and introduce him to Simone.
Eh, I don't know, Simone isn't struggling with a philosophy problem.
She's just, you know, like being silly.
Let's just get her to the welcome party and I'm sure she'll be fine.
Eleanor!
Look what my brain did!
It's not real and neither are you.
I'm in a coma and none of this is real Okay, I know this is bad and we need a new approach, but she is wearing the hell out of those foam fingers.
Dude!
Janet told you to stay at Mindy's.
I know, I just came to mix myself a Derek, and then I'll be on my way.
Before you leave, I want to call a truce.
- Hmm?
- Feel like you're trying to get under my skin, but it's okay.
I've decided to rise above it.
Well spoken, Mr. Mendoza.
Let me say in response I will destroy you.
Janet is, and always will be, my mommy-girlfriend.
You have crossed the Rubicon now, pal.
Mmm Okay, status report.
What have we learned about Linda?
Little, I'm afraid I tried talking to her, but it was the dullest conversation I have ever had, and this is coming from someone who once split a Xanax with Peter Sarsgaard.
Frankly, I'm glad she's boring.
We have enough to worry about.
How is Brent doing?
About the same, I'd say.
Princeton.
Graduated in the top half of the bottom half of my class.
Rowing team, sailing team, class president.
I hung out with all those guys.
Okay, and John, our favorite gossip columnist?
Luckily, before I died, I pumped my face with six vials of Juvederm.
I'm hoping that my corpse looks like a waxed tile floor.
My ex-boyf is going to be supes jel.
Okay, well, I'm gonna do a loop.
Trying to see who gets me.
Our biggest liability right now is Simone.
Let's try to keep the three of them away from her.
We can't wait any longer.
We have to introduce Simone to Chidi.
Why?
I-I think she's doing great.
See, she's getting all the cake-pushing out of her system.
I know it's painful to think of the two of them connecting, but Chidi made an incredible sacrifice.
He had his memories erased so he could help people.
And if we don't let him help Simone, it'll be all for nothing.
Fine.
Stupid ethical reasonable argument.
I wish you were a cake.
Push you over.
Are you still muttering?
No!
I stopped.
Stupid, good-hearing, reformed demon Wow.
-  - Oh!
Hey, there, Simone.
Shoving people in the pool, huh?
Yeah, just testing the laws of physics here in my nonsense brain jail.
Who's this?
Uh, this is Chidi Anagonye.
He was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy, so I figured he might be able to help Chidi Anagonye, that sounds so familiar.
Where did you teach?
- St. John's University in Sydney.
- Of course!
I used to teach there.
I must've seen his name on the faculty list and now my dying brain is just leaking out random information.
Oh, the human mind is truly incredible!
I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby Look, sorry, uh, what what's happening now?
When I was a kid, my CD alarm clock broke and it used to wake me up to that song every day, so now I'm singing it to try and wake myself up.
Okay, well, nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you too, cute guy generated by my rapidly decaying temporal lobe.
Doo, doo, doo, doo-do-do-doo Doo, doo, doo  Hey You know, it's bad enough you guys have taken over my house for a year and I've had to move into the attic, but now I have to walk in to find Darth Vader's turd in the middle of my living room.
I mean, what is this?
No time to explain.
Also, I kind of forgot.
Where is Derek's plunger?
The one that kills him.
Yeah, I used to do this whenever I needed some alone time.
Once, I rebooted him just because he was breathing super loud.
Then, when he woke up, he was like, "I don't breathe".
So I don't know what I heard.
Well, I'm doing this because he's trying to steal my girlfriend.
Yeah, you don't need to justify it.
Again, I do it all the time.
No, no, no, Mindy, please wait, don't kill me!
Oh it's you?
Okay, well, you certainly don't have the Dereks to    Yeah!
Oh, it's always good.
- Doo-do-do-doo, doo, doo, doo - You know what, Simone?
Think of it this way.
If this is really all a hallucination, doesn't it seem kind of basic?
I mean, surely, your brain would imagine something weirder than just a nice cocktail party?
Oh, you mean like that?
Attention, I have been Dereked.
That's probably my doctor.
Oh, this is all in my head.
I'm gonna go eat a knife.
Attention.
Murder has been me.
Let me get this straight: Derek, quote, "made mean eyes at you," so you went to Mindy's house and murdered him?
Yeah, dog, but his eyes were really mean.
You're probably thinking this but they were more like this -  - Jason, why did you kill Derek?
I had to get his giant head out of the sky before any of the humans could see, and it was not easy.
I was scared Derek was trying to slide into your DMs. I hate being scared.
It's it's scary.
I don't have time for this.
I am running a neighborhood and its residents, and Eleanor just casually orders me to make popcorn rivers, and Brent won't stop calling me for stuff.
Ugh!
Are we still boyfriend-not-a-girlfriend?
We'll talk about it later.
Okay, executive decision: forget about Simone.
Janet, make sure she doesn't come in contact with the other humans.
Let's focus on Linda.
We ought to be able to figure her out if we can just liven her up a bit.
We'll just, like, sprinkle some cocaine on her peppermints or something.
Does anyone else find it suspicious that the Bad Place sent someone so dull?
No, it makes perfect sense to me.
They are trying to drive us insane by giving us a big boring glob of plain yogurt.
Tomorrow morning, we start Operation Linda.
Okay, you heard the lady.
We'll meet in the town square bright and early.
Janet, set up for Flying Day.
Cool.
I'm not busy or anything, so that'll be easy.
Off you go.
Whoo-hoo!
Linda, how are you enjoying the Good Place?
It's good.
Everyone's flying.
You don't want to go flying any higher?
No, thanks.
Oh, well, okay.
Says in your file that you like knitting.
Would you like to do some knitting right now?
No, thanks.
Is there another activity you'd like to do now?
You also enjoyed listening to birds.
Man, Linda, you don't even look at them?
Let's go hear some birds.
What do you say?
I'm gonna go get another peppermint.
Come on, Lins.
You can have literally anything you could poss - What the -      Okay, so  Maybe she's less boring than I thought.
So let me get this straight, Shawn: you sent a demon in disguise as one of the subjects?
Yes, he did, Your Honor.
Luckily, none of the other test subjects saw the mess he made, but he put the experiment at risk and he attacked me and Eleanor.
And I'm sorry, where's your shirt?
I think it got stuck in the skin suit.
Well, keep it there.
Damn it, Chris, you were supposed to slowly undermine them and gradually sabotage the experiment, not just go ham on day two, you fart plume.
I told you, I'm not an actor.
And when you get back here, you won't be anything.
Okay, fine, yes, busted.
I'm a rascal.
We'll come pick him up and replace him with an actual human.
Oh, you will do nothing of the sort, mon ami.
This outrageous act must be punished.
Chidi will be the fourth subject in this experiment.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He's perfect because he's already had his memories erased.
Although you can't erase that booty, know what I'm saying, blondie?
All due respect, Your Honor, keep it in your robe.
What she means is thank you, Your Honor, we accept.
Chidi's gonna be our fourth subject.
Chidi can't be part of the experiment.
They already know that he can improve.
That's like studying for a test, then acing the test.
It's cheating.
How is that cheating?
You're just falsely accusing us of what you actually did.
No, that's what you're doing.
Shawn, I don't have time for this.
I just started "Deadwood" finally and I need my daily dose of Timothy Olyphant, so I'm gonna make this short.
If you so much as breathe on this experiment again, I will restart the entire thing from scratch, and then I will personally rip off your eyelids and make you watch heartwarming videos of soldiers coming home to their dogs.
Whoa, slow down.
Did you put those trash cans there just so you could crash into them?
That wasn't my fault, I was texting.
Okay, let him go, dung buckets.
Nice try.
We'll put him on the train and handcuff him to a bench.
Yeah, forgive us if we don't trust you not to cheat again.
Surprised you figured out that Linda was a fake, because we all thought you were too stupid.
Well, it was actually Tahani who got suspicious.
Aww that is so embarrassing for you.
Seems like you're royally forking this up, just like we knew you would.
Okay, take off, and give Shawn a message for me.
Tell him that we said, "Boo-yah"!
Make sure you do the hand motion.
Like, "Boo-yah"!
Are you listening to me?
- Okay, Michael, that's fine.
- No, show me - show me how you're gonna do it.
- That's fine.
No, it's important that she does the hand thing, 'cause it really drives the point home.
- -
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 - - Linda.
You can have literally anything you could possibly - What the - You sent a demon in disguise as one of the subjects?
This outrageous act must be punished.
Chidi will be the fourth subject in this experiment.
I still don't get why the Bad Place would try something so obvious.
They're desperate.
They know they're gonna lose.
Plus, we can get rid of the Linda picture and put a Chidi picture on the other side since we know a ton about him.
This is all good news, right, Team Leader?
Yeah, it's super cool that I'm actively surveilling and manipulating an ex-boyfriend.
I mean, more so than I usually did.
Okay, let's focus on Brent.
Born on third base, thinks he invented the game of baseball.
Guys like this believe that the world revolves around them because it kind of does.
If we could get him to listen to anyone else, he'd hear how much better they are than he was, which might make him realize that he doesn't belong here.
And also, bonus maybe he cries like a stupid little baby.
- - Anyway, long story short, that's why there are still ducks.
- I saved all the ducks.
- Aw!
Incredible.
Wow.
Thank you, Wanda.
What a life.
Now we turn to our next guest, Chidi Anagonye.
Now Chidi, you led an impressive life as an academic.
Well, not "save an entire species" impressive, but, yes, I was a professor of ethical and moral philosophy.
I'm sorry literally every duck?
- You saved every duck?
- In essence, yes.
And I didn't mention this before.
I really don't like to brag but also horses.
- Oh!
- What?
Man I mean, compared to you, I feel a little inadequate.
Hey, Mikey, can I ask you something?
I feel bad for making Janet's life more chaotic and unpredictable, so here's my idea to make it up to her.
Me and 100 Janet Babies do a giant flash mob just total unpredictable chaos all around her.
Great idea, right?
Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason, Jason.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, I put a little cheat code in the Neighborhood where if I say your name five times my headache goes away.
Do you know why I forced you to act like a monk in the original Neighborhood?
Does it have to do with the TV show "Monk"?
No.
It's because you have no control over your own impulses.
You think every problem can be solved with a Molotov cocktail or slashing somebody's tires or plunging Derek.
So being a monk was torture for you.
The only way for you to repair your relationship with Janet is to give her some space.
Show her that you can control your impulses.
So you're saying wanting to do something isn't a good reason to immediately do it?
Yeah.
Man, I wish someone had taught me this on Earth.
People tried, mostly judges.
Hey, show time.
And now, Brent Norwalk, why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Sure.
I'm pretty interesting.
I grew up in Chicago.
A suburb, obviously.
I went to Princeton University.
No handouts, by the way.
I earned my spot there just like my father and his father before him.
I then inherited the family business, and in just 18 years, I grew Norwalk Materials from a $90 million company to a $94 million company.
One second.
Hey, Janet.
- Hi, there.
- Perrier.
Why don't you tell us about a time when things didn't come so easy to you.
Look, I've had my share of disappointments.
I smartly bought Netflix stock at $38 a share, but I couldn't cash it in before I died, so all that money's going to my dumb kid.
But you have to press on, right?
In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., who I personally believe was a great man, he said that when life knocks you on your butt, you jump back up and start throwing haymakers.
I'm not sure he said that.
No, no, he did.
You're wrong.
For me, Eleanor, it's all about taking personal responsibility.
I don't know if people do that.
And if you ask me, that's what's wrong with this country.
What country?
This was fun, Eleanor, but I have a tee time.
Daddy no golfy, daddy get cranky.
So, Chad, duck lady, nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
You were great.
A car?
- He got a car?
- Okay, well, back to the drawing board.
If we want him to understand he doesn't belong here, we don't need a drawing board.
We need to bust him open like a piÃ±ata.
We tried that in the Bad Place.
The goo that comes out doesn't taste as good as candy.
No, dude, metaphorically.
Ahh.
Although, there is another Bad Place strategy that might work very well here.
I don't know if that's the right move.
It's our only move.
And we're doing it.
Tomorrow.
What the Hey, Janet?
Janet!
Is that Perrier?
- Michael, Eleanor.
- Brent, I'm so sorry.
We don't know why all of this is happening.
Well, I do.
This chaos is clearly all about me.
This is the universe telling me that I don't belong here.
Brent, what do you mean?
I don't belong in the Good Place.
I mean, obviously there's a place better than this.
I belong there.
In the best place.
Walk me through this, Brent.
I'm not sure we follow.
Well, I've been feeling this way for a while now.
I mean, this can't be all the Afterlife has to offer.
Not to the cream of the crop.
I mean, if this is heaven, then where are my guys?
Where's Scotty and Schultzy and Porcupine?
Where's White Guillermo?
And where is Mexican William?
And what about Squirtman?
Well, he makes a good point.
You know, what about Squirtman?
Also, frankly, my assistant Janet is a little uptight.
I mean, she hasn't worn any of my gifts.
Have you been asking Janet to make herself clothes that you give back to her?
Yeah, you're doing the math right there, bud.
Look, this chaos, which is clearly all about me, is a sign.
If this is the Good Place, I belong in the best place.
So figure it out.
Get back to me, okay?
I'm gonna go punch a wall with my head.
I'll meet up with you later.
Michael, I'm afraid we need to talk about Eleanor.
I know what you're gonna say.
She's just been really busy.
I'm sure she'll get around to showering at some point.
No, it's not that, although, it's not not that.
It's possible we need a new Team Leader.
Oh, really?
We just can't help but question her decision-making.
She balked at bringing Chidi and Simone together.
She ignored my concerns about Linda.
Her plans for Brent backfired.
We've made precious little progress.
Perhaps leadership isn't her forte.
Yeah, I mean, Eleanor is dope, but she keeps screwing everything up.
That's my thing, and you wouldn't put me in charge.
Actually, that's a decent point.
But think about what you're saying here.
We have.
We should at least discuss pursuing a change in leadership.
Yeah, definitely, let's pursue it.
Oh, hey, Eleanor, we were just talking about maybe you shouldn't be Team Leader?
- Saved it.
- Go ahead, guys.
Speak your mind.
It isn't personal, Eleanor.
When we started this experiment, I calculated a 9% chance of success.
After your first three days on the job, it's down to 7.1%.
So purely from a mathematical standpoint, you are kind of pooching it.
Very helpful feedback.
And if I could give you some feedback, I'd say that you're all ungrateful ash-faces who can shove your fat grumps all the way up your snork-box.
Which curses were those?
I didn't ask for this!
I'm only doing it because Michael, who is supposed to be in charge, had a nervous breakdown the second it started.
But maybe you can do it better than me.
Tahani can be in charge since she's so smart.
Or better yet, Jason.
Maybe all of humanity can be saved with one good old-fashioned Jacksonville carnival.
I mean, we could try.
All I need is a bouncy house, some ninja stars, and a bunch of ambulances.
Well, good luck, forkfaces.
I quit.
Shellstrop out.
You got it all out of your system?
You gonna come back?
- Get to work?
- No, man.
I meant what I said.
I quit.
I'm sorry you overheard that.
And they're sorry they said it.
But you don't just get to quit this, Eleanor.
This is not your 7th grade band or three hours into a two-week juice cleanse.
A little more at stake here.
Yeah, man, that's why I'm quitting.
The things that are happening here are above my pay grade.
How do I get Brent to stop being such a deckhead?
How do I fix Simone when she's convinced all of this is happening inside of her brain?
Ooh, maybe I should drive her into the arms of my ex-boyfriend that sounds fun.
What do I do about John the gossip king, or the demon spy who punched me in the face?
And how do I do it all with a pleasant smile to keep everyone's spirits up?
I'm not meant for this.
I'm not the freakin' savior of the universe.
I'm just a girl from Arizona.
That's it.
I'm just a normal girl from Arizona.
I ate junk food.
I watched reality shows.
I sometimes left H&M wearing more underpants than I had on when I came in.
I did a bad job of being in charge of my own life, and now I'm supposed to be in charge of everyone else's life?
I I cannot do this.
When I started my experiment, I thought: "Four broken birdbrains who will believe "everything I tell them.
This will be a breeze".
You beat me in three months.
Okay, fine, I thought.
A fluke.
You then beat me 800 more times.
Because human beings, it turns out, are weird and I will never truly understand what it's like to be one.
This is a job for a human one who's tough but also empathetic and has a big heart.
And a world-class bullshirt detector.
You think you can't do this?
Eleanor you're the only one who can do this.
Like it or not the only one who can save a humanity is a girl from Arizona.
But everything I do blows up in my face.
I'm like a hot, blonde Wile E. Coyote That's true.
About you making lots of mistakes, not the thing where you sexualized a cartoon.
Come on, you know how this works.
You fail and then you try something else.
And you fail again and again, and you fail a thousand times, and you keep trying because maybe the 1,001st idea might work.
Now, I'm gonna and try to find our 1,001st idea.
I hope you'll join me.
I hope you shower first and then join me.
Ladies and gentlemen, back with her trademark brand of B-minus leadership, Eleanor Shellstrop.
We are so, so, so sorry, Eleanor.
We never should've questioned you.
Don't worry about it, hot stuff.
I was questioning me, too.
But I'm back, baby.
And I have a new idea for Brent.
Guys like him never think they're wrong, so we're gonna tell him he's right.
Brent.
This conversation must remain confidential.
- Okay.
- Obviously, you're a very smart guy.
- Yes.
- But we need to know that we can trust you with sensitive information.
You can.
I routinely buried HR complaints, so, no problem.
Truth is, Brent, you figured us out.
There is a Best Place.
I knew it.
I knew it.
The Best Place is reserved for a select upper echelon of good people, sort of like a Diamond Elite VIP Club of Afterlife residents.
I was Diamond Elite.
I swear.
One time I did shots with this pilot in the lounge, and the guy let me fly his helicopter.
We know.
That's how you died.
- Right.
- So you'll all be evaluated, and then a very small group of the most morally upstanding residents get to go.
Oh, I see.
So it's like a "good deeds" contest?
That's easy.
I'm gonna crush this.
Oh, and hey mum's the word, right?
Why tip off my competition?
Oops.
Looks like you dropped your fork.
Let me get that for you.
Did you get that?
The fork thing?
Or should I start writing these down?
No, you're good.
We'll keep track.
Great.
Love it.
Hi, Jason.
Janet, I'm so happy to see you.
I got you a box of chocolates.
But then I remembered you can't eat, so I ate them.
And I thought it'd be a nice present for me to describe them to you.
So the first one was gross Jason, um, please just let me talk.
You know that I've been overwhelmed with work since the Neighborhood started.
- Yup.
- And I asked you to give me some space.
Yup.
I'm so sorry to say this.
But I can't be in a relationship with you right now.
Being with you is fun, but it's not always easy, and I'm afraid it would endanger the experiment.
- It won't, though.
- Jason, it already has.
So why don't we just take a break until it's all finished.
Also, I hate to pile on, but I feel like you have a right to know.
The Jacksonville Jaguars cut Blake Bortles.
He's not on the team anymore.
I am genuinely sorry.
Hi, how are you?
Nice to see you.
Enjoy your yogurt.
Problem is, now he's saddled with a bad motivation.
I mean, his points won't go up if the only reason he's being nice is to make his points go up.
Yeah, but that was also my situation when I first asked Chidi for help.
I only did it so you wouldn't catch me.
We have to hope that over time Brent starts doing good things out of habit.
Just like you.
Hey, I just realized something.
That whole "you're the only one who can save us" speech you didn't actually have a nervous breakdown on day one, did you?
You faked it so that I would step up and take over.
- Guilty.
- You tricky devil!
Very clever.
All right.
Time to go help Simone and Chidi.
Oof, why did I come up with this idea?
This is gonna hurt real bad.
I know, I know.
But I think it's gonna work.
Yeah, but it's gonna suck for me.
You sure there's no other girl from Arizona who can do this?
What about Emma Stone?
She's from there.
She's very capable.
Remember her in "Zombieland" and "La La Land"?
What's with all her movies ending with "land"?
- You're stalling.
- Yep, heading out.
Jason, I'm so sorry.
Janet was my whole Afterlife.
How am I gonna get over her?
I used to have a breakup routine when a relationship ended Champagne and Alanis Morissette.
Not the actual singer.
I'd just listen to her albums at my friend Adele's house.
I guess I could do my normal breakup routine drink a ton of Mountain Dew, steal an ATV, and ride it through a Panda Express.
But then I'd have to ask Janet for the Mountain Dew and the ATV, and then I'd have to see Janet, and then I'd start crying.
What do I do?
I honestly don't know.
But whatever you do, you'll be doing it with your friends.
And I didn't even get to tell you about the Blake Bortles part.
So, Chidi do you remember that woman Simone from the party the other night?
Simone the Third Eye Blind superfan who walked around cutting off people's ponytails?
That's the one.
I need your help acclimating her to the Neighborhood.
I've tried, but since she thinks this whole thing is imaginary and I'm an authority figure, I'm extra suspicious.
Well, what makes you think I'd have any more luck?
Chidi, you and Simone are soul mates.
Soul mates?
Like our souls are are Mates.
Yes.
Everyone has people that they're cosmically bound to, and the system brings them together in the Afterlife, and I can say with complete certainty that you and Simone are two such people.
I haven't told her yet.
I wouldn't have told you ordinarily, but since she's gone a little cuckoo bananas that's the official Architect term I thought it was prudent to let you know.
Whoo, boy, uh I'm getting a stomach ache but a good one.
A happy stomach ache.
This is new!
There are some great writings on simulated realities that might help her adjust Descartes, Moravec, Zhuang Zhou.
I wonder if I can summon a book from my apartment.
Well, good luck.
This is incredible!
I spent my whole life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe, but I never actually fell in love with someone.
I know.
Oh, right, of course.
You know everything about me.
I do, indeed.
Hi, Simone.
Uh, Chidi.
From the other night.
Oh, wow.
My brain must really like keeping you around.
Have a fake seat and grab a yogurt that doesn't exist.
Right, um so if I understand your state of mind, it's basically solipsism.
You think that you're the only real thing in the universe and everything else stems from your consciousness.
Yes, but to be fair, I only think that because it's true and I'm right.
No offense, but solipsism as a philosophy is pretty juvenile, especially for a person with multiple advanced degrees.
It's also impossible to refute because everything you see is confirmed by your belief.
However Dude.
What?
I mean, if none of this is real, then it really shouldn't matter, right?
In fact - Ha.
Dude!
- What?
It's not real!
None of this matters.
Leave that on your nose - for the rest of time.
- Fine.
Point sort of taken.
You know, in a larger sense, if you go around acting like no one else matters then you end up doing things like knocking over cakes and pushing people into pools and just generally acting like a jerk.
Why not treat them better just in case they're real?
I mean, what do you have to lose by treating people with kindness and respect?
Okay, keep talking, probably fake, but maybe real, philosopher man.
Well, good news Simone and Chidi are hitting it off.
I mean, I wasn't getting any use out of him as a boyfriend, so why not pass him off to someone in need?
Is this what donating old bras to Goodwill feels like?
Must've been really hard lying to Chidi like that.
That's the thing.
I don't know that it was a lie.
They did fall in love on Earth, and Michael was right.
Chidi made a huge sacrifice for us, and I had to make sure it was worth it.
It's arguable that you made an even bigger sacrifice.
You actually have to live with this situation.
Chidi just gets to go around blissfully unaware of what he gave up.
Yeah, but we know what he gave up.
Dat ash.
Come on, bud, I know you're down, but you can't leaving me hanging.
You're right.
That is the code.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 So what's on tap for today?
Chidi's study group should be off and running.
We can go check in on how Brent's doing.
If there's anyone that can turn that ash-hole into a good person, it's Chidi.
My man used to collect action figures of famous philosophers.
Oh, Eleanor, look, it's a near-mint Arthur Schopenhauer with a working quill!
What a dork.
I love him so much.
Chidi might make the new humans better all on his own.
It's so great he erased his memory.
But, you know, it's also quite sad for you in a way that I always think about and am respect of.
-  - What the fork?
Hi, Eleanor.
Hi, Michael.
We were just heading off for picnic.
Oh, you know, we were actually just gonna go check in on your new student, Brent.
Oh, you know, I'm not sure that Brent's in it for the long haul.
He came to one session, and then he said he got a B+ in Moral Values at Princeton, and so maybe he should be the professor.
Then he asked me if I knew that he went Princeton.
I said I did.
Then he said he went to Princeton, and he left.
- Eh, what are you gonna do?
-  Well, just for argument's sake, what would Kant say about your duty to help your fellow human beings?
Well, honestly, when the weather is this perfect, I think that Kant would say, "Who's up for some Frisbee golf"?
Guys, you gotta hear this joke I made about Kant.
Never seen Chidi like that.
He was chillaxing, which is a word I just invented, combing Chidi and relaxing.
Yeah, I guess once you have the burden of saving humanity removed from your brain, life is dandy.
Must be nice, Chidi.
That's what's missing.
Chidi isn't being tortured.
As far as he's concerned, he did everything right on Earth, so now he just gets to enjoy himself.
If we don't force Chidi into stressful decision-making, he won't get the chance to become a better person.
Right.
You want to make a pearl, you gotta get some sand in your clam.
Oyster.
We need Chidi to live in a world of low-grade dread.
I've got this.
I have a ton of experience making ex-boyfriends' lives miserable.
First up, we fill his acoustic guitar with wet cat food.
Judge me all you want.
I get results.
- Janet, darling?
- Hi, there.
- Oh, you dyed your hair.
- I did.
After I broke up with Jason, I researched how humans cope with relationships ending, and number eight on the list was doing something dumb with your hair.
Number 42 was watch "Mamma Mia!
Here We Go Again," so I did that, too.
It was okay.
It's just a lot of the same songs as the first one.
Well, hopefully, diving back into work was also high on that list because we need to help John and I know how.
- Spa day.
- Spa day?
That's right, Janet.
I've cracked the code.
See, in 2014, John wrote eleven articles mocking Gigi Hadid's vacation at an exclusive resort in Bali.
But then he researched cheap flights to Bali for himself, and looked into something called a discount hotel package?
See, John's pettiness was the result of feeling excluded by the rich and powerful.
So I, the rich and powerful, am going to welcome him into an exclusive world of luxury and pampering!
Oh, he loves celebrity gossip.
You should tell him about how eight different characters from "Game of Thrones" are based on you.
That is a great idea.
See?
You're getting it now.
First, we open his pores, and then we open his heart.
We exfoliate the dead skin cells of envy, and we detoxify his soul.
Spa day.
Spa day.
I'm so excited for Spa day.
I mean, I know I can eat whatever I want and not gain weight and the air is obviously perfect and no one has any jobs or stress or problems, but I just feel like I need this.
Well, you are in for a treat 'cause I had Janet build an exact replica of Victoria Beckham's ultra-exclusive private spa.
Posh's spa?
The Posh Wash?
It's the most coveted invitation in England.
Membership is based on weight and net worth.
Gain a pound or lose a pound, and you're out.
Shall we go?
Jason, there you are?
We need your help.
Okay.
Hand me the jar.
Of what?
The peanut butter jar.
Get it.
You said you needed help opening a peanut butter jar.
No, we didn't.
Oh.
Then who said that?
No one.
Shut up and listen.
We need your help with something very important.
Are you sure?
I'm probably just gonna mess it up.
Just like I messed things up with Janet.
Dude, helping to save humanity is as good a way as any to get over a breakup.
I mean, it's not like Janet has a car you can key, or a house you can "Left Eye" Lopes.
Okay.
I'm in.
I got your back, guys.
Now hand me that jar.
Are you speaking metaphorically, like the task we're embarking on is a metaphorical jar you're gonna open by accomplishing the task?
Yes.
Oh, goodie.
Cucumber water.
Nope.
This is fresh water from Oprah's estate in Maui with mushrooms from her private bog in the Pyrenees Mountains.
Oh, my God.
It tastes like candy.
You know what they say.
A mushroom from Oprah's bog is better than anything from anywhere else.
Ugh, I didn't know that they said that.
I missed out on all the cool celebrity sayings.
Say good-bye to FOMO.
You can finally experience the best of the best.
The only thing that would make this any better is some hot goss.
-  - Very well.
Our story begins when I ran into Robbie Williams, Heidi Klum, and the remaining members of Fifth Harmony at the Dolce & Gabbana spring show.
Hate him, loathe her, over them, cancel it, tell me everything.
So Natalie Portman does all of Scarlett Johansson's stunts?
- Why?
- For the power.
- Just to say she can.
-  Sure, I get that.
Tahani, I feel amazing.
Thank you.
You're quite welcome!
Hey, you know what would give you an even more luminous glow?
There was this sort of inner treatment that was all the rage on Earth, the study of ethics.
Think of it as a colonic, but for your soul!
Our resident philosopher Chidi Anagonye leads an ethics study group in his apartment.
What do you say you and I sit in?
Would I like to use my time in heaven to audit a philosophy class?
Um no.
You stay crazy, girl!
Bye.
- Hey!
- Hi!
- So how was the picnic?
- Oh, amazing.
I mean, there were ants everywhere, but they were so helpful.
They carried our wine glasses back and forth and they folded our napkins for us.
- They were so cute.
- Wait till you see the otters who do our turn-down service.
Listen, you might know Jianyu, the monk?
He wants to join your philosophy study group.
Oh, sure, we can get that up and running again.
Maybe discuss some Lao Tzu and Confucius.
Fun!
Everything is so fun.
Perfect.
Just one thing.
So he's been having kind of a hard time adjusting here.
Apparently monks aren't the most social creatures.
So just promise me you'll help him no matter what.
Eleanor, I swear to you I will look after Jianyu as if he is my own brother.
Wow.
I mean, a promise from a strict Kantian like yourself is just about the most ironclad agreement in the universe.
Okay.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
So, Jianyu, would you like some Yo, shut up for a sec.
I'm not a Buddhist monk.
My name is Jason Mendoza.
I'm a DJ from Florida, and I'm not supposed to be here.
You gotta help me out, homie.
I'm scared.
Tea.
I was gonna offer you some tea.
- - Dude, thanks to you, my dream came true.
I have a shiny new butthole.
- You okay, homie?
- No!
I've had a stomach ache for a week.
There have been way too many close calls.
Please, I beg you, no more meatball subs.
No more drawing boobs in the dirt.
I cannot lie to cover for you.
Please remember you're supposed to be a monk.
Hey!
Eleanor and Michael are here.
What a fun surprise.
- You've done some redecorating.
- Oh.
Uh, yes, my apartment was decorated in one way, and now it has been redecorated.
- And how's Jianyu?
- I mean, you know how monks are.
Calm, peaceful, never, you know, shotgunning Cheez Whiz.
I mean, what monk would do that?
No monk!
Anyway I see you guys are still here.
We were just dropping by to ask a favor.
Can you accompany Jianyu to the luau tonight?
He still isn't really engaging with the Neighborhood, and we were hoping you could help him break out of his shell.
Actually, I don't think I can make it.
Oh, why not?
I just remembered.
I can make it, so I will see you there.
Okay, bye.
I don't understand why John hasn't made more progress.
You've done so much to make him feel special.
I know.
I recreated the private tour of the Louvre where they let you touch all the art.
We rode Aquamans through the water.
I got so many beauty treatments I fear my hair may be too shiny and lustrous.
We've been getting on quite well, but every time I bring up self-improvement, he just shuts me down.
I haven't encountered this much resistance since I tried to get TimothÃ©e Chalamet to go out into the sun.
You know, I looked at John's files again.
He was hardly a shrinking violet.
If you think he needs help, maybe you should just tell him directly.
Perhaps you're right.
I shall go on the attack, just like six of the eight "Game of Thrones" characters who were based on me would do.
Yeah.
So how are things going with Chidi?
Super easy.
All I have to do is be myself, and he's constantly freaking out.
You have that effect on people, bud.
What else can we do to mess up his life?
Listen, E-dog, I know people don't look to me for plans or ideas or anything, but maybe we should ease off.
He's pretty stressed already.
Please.
He's not even dry-heaving yet.
How many Tums did he take today?
- Like 20.
- Pfft, that's nothing.
We don't stop until it's a whole bottle.
Because the more miserable he is, the more he's going to teach you, and then everyone, and then he'll save humanity.
He's like Superman with nervous diarrhea.
Get ready.
I'm gonna make that speech soon.
Hey, girl.
Want to hit up the spa tomorrow?
I want to try that new "Little Mermaid" treatment, the one where they remove your vocal chords and it somehow makes your legs look amazing.
Perhaps, but I was hoping to bend your ear on a more serious matter.
The things you used to write, frankly were hurtful.
What?
Name one.
I gained five pounds, and you called me Ta-Hammy All-the-Meals.
I mean, that's just poetry.
Well, you were so mean to Daniel Day-Lewis, - he quit acting.
- Oh, I'm sorry, was he living in character as a man who thought he could pull off boot-cut jeans?
You know what?
I see what this is.
This has been a fake friendship.
This whole week has just been a wind-up to a sucker-punch.
No, it hasn't.
I just want you to recognize that your blog hurt people.
And you have a chance to be better here.
B'scuse me?
You're telling me to be better?
While you were gallivanting around with your fancy friends, I lived in the real world, so I had bills to pay.
I worked 16 hours a day by myself building a site with millions of readers.
You're the one with issues, sweetheart.
If you spot it, you got it.
Whoosh.
That's another deuce for the gossip toilet.
Hello and welcome!
Is everyone having fun tonight?
We have an exciting activity planned for all of you.
You have all been given a magic lava stone.
When you throw them into the bonfire, you will receive whatever your soul most desires.
Ahh.
Step right up, Matilda.
Give it a toss.
My childhood pet, Shell Turtlestein.
-  - Oh, hi!
I want to do that.
No, you cannot under any circumstances do that.
Okay, but I gotta do that.
No!
If you throw that stone, your truest actual desire will appear, and who knows what that is?
I do.
My old motorcycle with Pamela Anderson airbrushed on the side.
It exploded a week after I got it because someone wanted to see what would happen if they poured lighter fluid in the engine.
Was that someone you?
Yep.
Turns out it explodes.
Called it.
Look, maybe Jianyu the monk likes motorcycles.
We don't know his life.
No monk's truest desire is a motorcycle with Pam Anderson's face painted on it.
Oh, it wasn't her face.
No!
A sexually explicit motorcycle?
Whose rock was that?
Hey, it's mine.
Jianyu tossed my rock because he wanted to help me, his friend, who loves motorcycles and Canadian TV actress Pamela Anderson.
Thanks, Jianyu.
And now I will ride it away.
Can't wait to cruise the streets in this bad boy.
Yeah, man.
Now we're cooking with gas.
Well, this was a huge success.
Chidi's an absolute mess.
Oh, we should pop open some champagne.
Call those magic ants.
He's clearly being tested like never before.
Yeah, and now we need to ramp up the pressure.
Eleanor, he told an outright lie.
We don't want him so freaked out that he can't help anyone else.
I think we did enough for the day.
No way, dude.
We can't stop now.
We have to push him to the edge.
We have to knead his fragile psyche until he's hyperventilating - and losing his mind.
-  Hi, guys, um - can we talk?
- Yeah.
I need to tell you a secret.
I  I can't   No, no, guys, guys, not now.
I Spent my whole life on Earth battling a stomach ache because I never knew what to do.
And for a while here, that was gone, but recently, I've been miserable.
Why, Chidi?
You're in the Good Place.
I know, but I have this problem, and if I choose option A  But if I choose option B  No.
You know, Chidi, sometimes adversity can lead to growth.
Whatever the moral dilemma is, maybe you'll come out on the other side better for it.
Yeah.
No.
I'm used to moral dilemmas.
I like moral dilemmas.
They're my jam, but this just feels like I'm - What?
- Like I'm being punished somehow.
And, obviously, I know that's silly.
This is the Good Place.
You two would never do anything to hurt anyone, but I am seriously worried that I did something wrong, and this is the universe getting back at me.
Oh, no.
What's happening now?
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I made God cry?
Oh, stomach ache.
Welcome back, old friend.
I can't believe John.
The man who once started a protracted Twitter feud with Jacob Tremblay thinks I'm the one with issues?
Maybe you need to be even more direct with him.
Like, punch him in the face.
I don't know.
I'm fired up.
You've just been very nice to him and I don't like the way he's treating you.
Maybe it's not possible.
We're just too different.
He spent his life in the bowels of the Internet, jealous and miserable with no real friends, while I spent my life in the upper echelon of society jealous and miserable with no real friends.
Oh, Janet.
I've been going about this all wrong.
Exactly.
Here you go.
Oh, uh no, I'm Why?
Why are you crying?
This is all my fault.
I promised I'd take care of you, Chidi.
- You did?
- Yes.
I promised.
Uh, see, Chidi, the Architect is responsible for the entire Neighborhood, so a resident suffering in any way, it's very painful for her.
Actually, come here.
Come here.
But don't worry.
We have a very simple solution for problems here.
Oh, good.
What is it?
We eliminate them.
So you just tell us a problem, and we'll eliminate it, like, say you had a problem with that vase.
-  -  See?
So just tell me what's bothering you, I'll wave my hand, it'll explode, and you can go back to your otherwise perfect life.
Uh the motorcycle.
Yep.
That's my problem.
For some reason, it just hasn't been bringing me as much happiness as maybe it wasn't intended to, so I'd just as soon get rid of it.
Done.
Oh, not again.
No more motorcycle.
- Problem solved.
- Great.
Uh, Eleanor, I hope you feel better.
No, no, she'll be fine.
She'll be fine.
John, I have something to say.
Round two.
Let's do this.
In 2007, Blake Lively invited me to a birthday party held for Leonardo DiCaprio aboard Paul Allen's mega-yacht.
I see we're dropping names three at a time now.
The guest list was 100 of the wealthiest, most famous members of the glitterati.
Once aboard, I discovered there was a VIP deck.
And within that area, there was an even more exclusive room that you could only access with a secret PIN, which I promptly entered.
And guess who was waiting for me.
I hate to admit it, but I have to know.
Who?
No one.
I was the only one there.
The party raged on outside, but I was so obsessed with status that I never left.
I spent the entire night talking to no one.
Riveting story.
If only it were longer and sadder.
The point is, if all you care about in the world is the velvet rope, you will always be unhappy no matter which side you're on.
You and I are proof of that.
But now we're here.
Can we just start over?
Well if we're gonna be friends, I need to say something.
I really am sorry for all the posts I wrote about you.
And everything I tweeted.
And scrawled on the back of a playbill during the intermission of "Wicked" and had someone pass it to you and say it was from an anonymous concerned citizen.
- That was you?
-  Well, my bangs were making my ears look chunky.
That was a fair hit.
It's a lovely night.
Would you like to go for a walk?
-  - Okay, Jason, new plan.
Instead of just trying to not get caught, we're going to study ethics.
I'm going to help you become a good person.
Oh, dope.
I always want to get better.
That's why I spent so much of my time at the free clinic.
Hang on.
Just editing my syllabus in my head based on that comment.
This is gonna be awesome.
You rule.
You're like the Pam Anderson boob motorcycle of people.
Thank you.
That's an amazing compliment.
And I'm sorry your actual motorcycle blew up.
Oh, that's okay, homie.
That's just what motorcycles do.
So Chidi's set with Jason now.
How are you doing?
A little better.
But still terrible.
You were torturing him because that's what we had to do.
I know.
But I went too far.
And what's worse I liked it.
Because I'm angry at him.
For leaving me.
Which isn't even remotely fair, because he sacrificed himself for us.
But I'm still angry he abandoned me, which makes me feel guilty, which makes me angry, which makes me want to talk to Chidi because he's the person I go to when I'm angry.
So it's a real fun cycle.
I still don't have a grip on the human emotional spectrum.
You guys are often happy when you should be sad and angry when you should be happy, and texting when you should be driving, which is not an emotion, I know, but it's insane.
The point is, in this case, even if it's not rational, you're allowed to feel a little angry.
Let yourself off the hook.
Process it and work your way through it, and then get your shirt together.
Because we have a lot of work to do.
Morning, all.
Anyone interested in a status report?
I win.
I mean, I'll start.
I have made massive progress with John.
Great.
Is he gonna join Chidi's class?
Philosophy may not be his way forward.
Genuine human connection shall be his course of study.
And first up on the syllabus, he and I will be unironically watching the Britney Spears movie "Crossroads" together  And you'll have to trust me, this is a huge step in the right direction.
Wonderful work, Tahani.
And, Jason, I mean, bravo.
Thanks, guys.
It's been a tough couple weeks, and it just felt really good to be brainy and have a useness.
Sure, bud.
Well, I think we can finally say that all four of these mofos are on the right path, so what's next?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 - 30 seconds left.
- Come on.
Oh, oh, it's a butterfly!
Oh, it's Mariah Carey's lower back butterfly tattoo.
- Yes!
-  Well done, John.
And because you guessed correctly, watch what happens.
Oh.
Oh!
I should've gotten that sooner.
I wrote my college thesis on that back tattoo.
Yes, because remember, every picture from tonight will have something to do with your lives on Earth, so you can get to know each other a little bit better.
Okay, Blue Team, you're up.
Go get 'em, chippy.
Chidi, it's your turn.
Oh.
I'm a pretty decent artist, but I'm not so great under pressure.
Your time begins now.
Ooh, boy.
Okay.
- You got this, Chidi.
- I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to figure out how to start.
Come on.
Just start drawing, my brotha.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No.
- 30 seconds!
- Ah!
Okay, here we go.
Uh oh.
Uh, it's a submarine.
Looks like broccoli with teeth.
Oh, oh, it's a horse with a bow on its neck.
Oh, is it my childhood pony, Daisy?
- Yes!
-  - Oh, no.
-  No!
What have I done?
You made a freakin' Frankenstein, man.
Okay, okay, okay.
You know what?
Magic Pictionary is over now, so let's all go home and get some sleep.
You guys want me to kill it?
I've shot a lot of race horses.
-  - Okay.
Fork me.
That was a disaster.
How did that go so wrong?
Well, for one thing, Brent got super wasted.
We should've cut him off.
Nobody gets cut off in the Good Place.
If he asks for beer, I give him a beer.
I'm just glad he stopped asking me to go to dinner so we could discuss my career.
Man, we haven't done a successful activity in, like, three weeks.
We're ice cold.
Guys, give yourself a break.
They're getting better.
Brent stopped saying "daddy like" all the time.
That's something.
Something feels off.
All right, we need new ideas.
I say we hole up here for an all-night - brainstorming session.
- Now just hang on.
We're working really hard, and we need to relax occasionally, or we're gonna just burn out.
So let's just, you know, clear our brain, watch a movie, or oh!
We'll have a slumber party.
- -  What the fork?
Whoever you are, show yourself.
Oh.
Hold on.
The hood is caught in my glasses.
Hi.
I'm Glenn from the Bad Place.
What are you doing here?
Yeah, what do you want, creep?
No one knows I'm here, and I have some important information.
Eleanor, I need to speak with you alone.
Whatever you need to say to me, you can say right here.
I don't think I should.
It would lead to a very uncomfortable social situation.
Say it.
That's not Michael.
That's Vicky the Demon in a Michael suit.
And she's sabotaging your experiment.
You see?
It's uncomfortable.
All right, just sit there quietly until we sort all this out.
If it's not too much trouble, could I get a hot glass of pig urine?
We need to talk.
Or I'm not picky.
Whatever urine you have is fine.
Eleanor, you have to believe me.
I'm Michael.
He's lying.
Calm down, dude.
I trust you.
But I'm gonna make Glenn think I don't trust you.
Somehow this has to be related to the problems we've been having here.
And we need to figure out what game they're playing.
Ooh, that's good.
I like the way you think, Shellstrop.
I mean, I hate the way you think, Shellstrop!
Is he buying it?
He's not looking.
I'll tell you whatever you want to know, but shouldn't we call The Judge?
We're not calling anyone until we figure some things out.
- We have questions.
- Yeah, for example, if you're a devil, how come you're not wearing Prada?
Caramel!
Why would you help us?
One day, you're flattening penises, and the next, you just decide to defect?
Actually, one of my jobs was to reinflate the penises so they could get flattened again.
It doesn't matter.
Listen, I loved torturing humans because I thought they deserved it.
They said everyone in the Bad Place was evil and beyond repair.
I don't know if I believe that anymore.
Also, Shawn is so mean, you guys.
He yells at me all the time.
It's, like, unnecessary.
I feel you, dog.
I was yelled at my whole life.
People were always like, "You didn't pay for that"!
"How do you plead"?
"He's flatlining"!
"Clear"!
Okay, well, if that's Vicky, what's the Bad Place's plan?
To sow chaos turn you guys against each other, ruin the experiment.
Also, I have proof that's not Michael.
Here are pictures of Vicky wearing the Michael suit.
This doesn't prove anything.
These could just be pictures - of the real Michael.
- They're real.
I know because I helped make the suit.
I couldn't figure out how to make it contain your demon essence, so you'll have to wear it over the Vicky suit.
Ugh, really?
You're the worst, Glenn.
Let's do it.
Zip her up.
Okay, but if I melt, I am gonna be, like, so annoyed.
Huh.
Pretty well-made.
I can really feel all the musty skin folds, and and the dangly bits.
The voice is perfect.
You sound so much like him, I want to punch you.
Are we sure it's okay that we made this?
I mean, what are you gonna use it for?
What are you gonna use it shut up, Glenn.
The experiment is about to begin.
Let's call the real Michael and send him spiraling down the toilet bowl like the pinched turd he is.
Well, now, we know you're lying because Michael would've definitely told us if the Bad Place had called him and showed him some freakin' Michael suit.
Absolutely.
Of course I would've.
I mean, Janet would have phone records.
You could just ask her to pull them up.
Okay, fine.
I lied.
- They called me.
- What?
I lied about that.
And I'm sorry.
You knew about this?
Yes, yes, but there's there's a good explanation.
Yeah, the explanation is that's Vicky, and she's lying to you about everything.
Call The Judge and we'll settle this once and for all.
Or is that exactly what you wanted us to do?
That is what I want you to do.
Exactly.
Eleanor, perhaps we should call The Judge.
Glenn was telling the truth.
No, The Judge said if anything else went wrong, she would reset the whole experiment.
We are not calling her unless we have no other choice, and I am locking you two jamokes in separate rooms until we get to the bottom of this.
Ugh!
I'm very upset about this development.
I'm serious, man.
This is happening.
Oh.
I'm very upset about this development.
All right, buttheads, what do we do?
I say we trust Michael.
He's our friend.
Wait, might be our friend, or he might be a lying trickster who just looks like our friend the classic Mary-Kate Olsen.
I have to say, we've had a lot of misfires recently, and Michael has been acting suspiciously.
Like tonight, when I wanted to work, and he just wanted to have a slumber party instead?
To be fair to Mike, slumber parties rule.
And why would we trust Glenn?
- He's a demon.
- So is Michael.
- Demons can be good.
- Right.
Okay.
So it's decided.
We trust both of them.
Okay.
Predictably, this was unhelpful.
Get in there.
What is all this stuff?
- Are these weapons?
-  Ooh, don't touch those.
Those are my special magnet handcuffs.
They make me feel silly when Mindy and I are playing Upstairs-downstairs Derek.
Oh, they're sex toys.
Ugh, they're sex toys.
Dude, get out of here.
We have enough problems.
My good man, allow me to bury the hatchet.
Being rebooted again has evolved me past any feelings of jealousy.
-  - Oh, I know that sound.
Looks like someone found my sex diaper.
I'll leave you guys alone to live that dipe life.
- Ugh.
- Eugh!
Okay, explain yourself if yourself even is yourself.
I am Michael.
Shawn did call me, and I saw the Michael suit.
He said if the experiment failed, he was gonna use it to make you think I was torturing you.
Why didn't you tell us?
Because he said he would just erase your memories of me telling you, so it wouldn't matter anyway.
He thought that I would crumble under the pressure.
But a month ago, you told me you only pretended to freak out in order to get me to step up and become a leader.
Yes, that also was a lie, but it was an inspirational one.
Like, "So great running into you.
We should get coffee some time," or all of Instagram.
So to recap, you found out the Bad Place made a Michael suit, freaked out, didn't tell us why, and then later, you lied to me about why you freaked out?
And then you lied again just a few minutes ago when you said that you never got a call from Shawn.
Yes, but that lie was only to cover my two earlier lies.
I mean, that's gotta be okay, right?
What?
Eleanor, don't you see what they're doing?
Shawn sent Glenn to undermine our trust in each other so you'll call The Judge and restart the experiment.
Well, I have no reason not to believe you, other than the three very recent examples we just laid out.
Huddle.
Now.
-  -  Oh, hey, sorry.
I just needed to grab this.
You know, it's chime time.
There's gotta be a way to figure out if that's the real Michael.
Is there a way you can make some sort of demon lie detector?
Oof.
I don't know.
The Janet babies are still draining me, and I just had to put down Daisy the horse blob, which was exhausting emotionally and physically.
She fought back.
I won't get into details.
I had to twist her head off.
Sorry.
No more details.
She did thrash.
She thrashed.
- Sorry.
- Okay, why don't we just get him drunk so he starts blabbing?
I mean, what goes best with pig urine?
- Coconut rum.
- That won't work on a demon.
I'll try and make a lie detector.
Oh, no.
Damn it.
What's going on in there?
I touched the dang diaper.
Get back in that room.
So Michael saw the suit.
Big deal.
I still think you're forking with us.
I think this is just like when the Bad Place sent us Linda, who turned out to be some super-jacked punching guy, and just like him, you got busted.
That's the thing.
The puncher didn't get busted.
It worked exactly as planned.
The whole thing was a diversion to get real Michael out, and sneak the imposter in on a train.
It must've happened during the handoff.
While Janet was handcuffing Chris, a bunch of demons must've grabbed Michael, yanked him away, and then Vicky, in the Michael suit, walked back out.
You never would've known the difference.
Also, when Chris got back, I saw Shawn and him celebrating.
Why would they be happy if he wasn't supposed to get caught?
Man, I love a good sabotage.
Or is that exactly what you want us to think?
Motherforker.
I knew there was something weird about that puncher.
I said that to Michael and he dismissed it.
Yeah.
See what I mean?
Don't go anywhere.
Come on.
If Michael is just Vicky in a Michael suit, let's just take the suit off.
Yeah.
Maybe we could sneak up behind him, and try and pants him from forehead.
That won't work.
A demon can take his own skin suit off, but no one else can.
It's like a very complicated bra.
Well, so be it.
Take off your skin suit.
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.
You're either a demon wearing a Michael suit, or you're a demon wearing a Vicky suit who's wearing a Michael suit over that.
Just take off your Michael suit, and show us what you're working with.
I'm sorry.
I won't.
- That's very suspicious.
- I know, but I'm not Vicky.
I just don't want to show you what's underneath here.
I've seen a lot of weird hogs in my life, dude.
- Get over yourself.
- That's not it.
I'm a fire squid.
Dope.
No.
Not dope.
I'm a 6,000-foot tall fire squid.
I have tentacles.
There's teeth everywhere.
I'm on fire, and my neck is long.
And there's a smell, and lots of juice.
There's so much juice, El.
I think I speak for everyone here when I say I really have to see this.
So you're not gonna take off your demon Spanx because you're shy?
Well, that's convenient.
Eleanor, if I take off this suit, I will crash through the roof and the entire Neighborhood will see me and the experiment will be blown.
But it's more than that.
You guys will never look at me the same way again.
I won't just be Michael.
I'll be some disgusting mass of burning tentacles.
Do you really want to be friends with something like that?
Yes.
I keep saying.
Eleanor.
Now I don't know if this will work, but theoretically, if you point it at a demon and he's lying, it'll turn red.
If he's telling the truth, it'll turn green.
Okay.
Glenn.
This is a lie detector.
Let us show you how it works.
-  - What's your name?
Well, everyone calls me Glenn, but the name on my demon certificate is actually Snakes Pour Forth From His Anu -  -  Glenn blew up.
Glenn blew up.
Or is that exactly what he wants us to think?
So does blowing up mean he was telling the truth or lying?
Neither.
That was not supposed to happen.
I've never killed anybody before.
No, don't worry.
Demons can't die.
He'll slowly reform himself over a few months, passing through all the stages of demon growth larva, slug monster, spooky little girl, teenage boy, giant ball of tongues, social media CEO, and then finally demon, so Look at the bright side.
This worked out perfectly.
I mean, not for Glenn, obviously, but for us.
Lying demon's gone.
We're still here.
All good.
No.
We're not all good, man.
You're either Michael and you lied, or you're Vicky in a Michael suit.
Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk.
Nobody go anywhere.
- Chidi?
- Hey.
Hey, I didn't think anyone would still be up.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just practicing drawing viable horses ones that aren't crimes, you know, against nature.
Okay, I know this mood of yours from reading your file and whatnot.
Why don't you take a break, and we'll get some food in you?
Well, I'm done.
I scooped it all up into one steaming pile of Glenn.
Maybe I can put him back together.
I'm hella good at puzzles.
I finished this word search in, like, 30 seconds.
Jason, I feel terrible.
I know he was a demon and he may have lied to us, but he didn't deserve that.
You were only trying to help us.
Look, I know this is a weird time, but if you ever want to talk, just know that I'm here for you, girl.
Thanks, Jason.
That means a lot.
Mmm.
I gotta say.
Out of all the human stuff I've been able to experience in this neighborhood, nachos number one.
- Easy.
- Really?
Yeah.
I mean, salty, crunchy, cheesy, little bit of a kick?
Name one better thing humans have created.
The Sistine Chapel?
Pfft.
Paint on a ceiling.
I mean, it's fine, but can you eat it at the movies?
TouchÃ©.
Listen, don't stay up all night drawing horses.
It's really fine.
I know.
I just feel like I made the world a little bit worse, and I won't be okay until I make it better again.
Making yourself miserable to ease the suffering of others about the most Chidi thing you can do.
I'll see you later.
Do you want to take the rest of the those nachos?
Yeah, I do.
Thank you.
Okay, here's where I'm at.
I just don't know if I can ever trust you.
I'm gonna call The Judge.
We'll start over.
We won't have Chidi in the mix, but he'll be on our side again, which is almost as good.
But we know the humans now.
Starting over sounds exhausting.
I know, but if that's not Michael, he could sabotage us in ways we can't even perceive, and even if it is, I can't fully trust him, so every time something goes wrong, a little part of me is gonna wonder.
We have to start over.
I have a better idea.
I'm gonna blow myself up.
-  What?
- I'll blow myself up.
That way, you can continue the experiment with Chidi as one of the people, which is our best chance to ever be successful.
Why not just lock you in a room or in Janet's void or something?
But then you might worry that I'd escape.
I blow myself up, I'm out of your hair for good.
Well, parts of me will be in your actual hair, - but you get it.
- Michael, wait.
Tahani, this is the only way.
There's literally noting I can say that will make you realize that I'm really me.
Oh, boy.
This is gonna suck.
Hopefully, I will see you all in a few months.
Good luck.
Oh, and make sure that you, uh, get all of me into the container, or I might come back way shorter.
And that would bum me out.
I wish I were saying this in different circumstances but Take it sleazy.
Michael, wait!
Oh, crud nuts.
Jason, how did you know that was bad Janet?
Michael said there's nothing he could say that would make you realize he's really him, but Janet does have a thing she can say that does make me realize she is really not her.
What?
I called Janet "girl," but she didn't say, "Not a girl".
The real Janet always says, "Not a girl".
Oh, wow.
That realization is the only thing that stopped me from becoming a pile of goo.
- Oh.
-  Wait, how did you pull it off?
You were outside on the platform with me the whole time.
We brought two bad Janets on the train, you dumb, dumb idiot.
The other one distracted you on the platform while good Janet brought Chris onto the train.
I snuck out, marbelized Janet, and then I took over, baby.
Stupid Michael never knew.
I had you fartknockers fooled for weeks, until Glenn the traitor ruined everything.
- That guy sucks, right?
-  Shut up, Glenn.
-  - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Bad Janets can't impersonate Good Janets.
I've seen them try.
Their heads melt, so Oh.
Oh, you're so smart, sir.
Well, listen, here's the thing.
Shawn rebooted me, like, 40 million tines.
Wait, tine-him-is.
Time-ses.
These things rule.
Oh, dip.
This means Janet didn't dump me.
Her weird sister did.
Everything makes so much more sense.
All of Janet's ideas were so counterproductive.
She brought the horse monster to life.
She forced me to antagonize John.
She got us to doubt Eleanor's leadership skills.
Oh, I was just about to launch an idea where Tahani was gonna give herself an asymmetrical haircut.
You monster.
Thank you!
Guys, we still have a problem here.
You still don't have evidence that I'm actually me.
Sure, we do.
You offered to sacrifice yourself to help a bunch of cockroaches.
That's about the most Michael thing you could do.
Then where's real Janet?
Oh, she's in the Bad Place.
She's probably wiping her butt with her own butt.
I can't bear the idea of poor Janet down there all alone.
What should we do?
I know what to do.
It's like what that guy who blew up said.
Shawn's a bully, and sometimes, the only thing a bully understands is punch in the mouth.
I'm gonna go down there, I'm gonna punch him in the mouth, and I'm gonna get Janet back!
Oh, sounds like somebody has a plan.
Dope.
Where is he?
- What's the plan?
- It's okay.
- -  You sure you can hold down the fort?
Not at all.
You sure you can do your thing?
Nope.
We'll just try our best.
Right?
Okay, let's go get our girl.
Not a girl.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Oh, Janet, you disappoint me.
I expected more of a fight from you.
Yet here you are, all alone in the Bad Place, rendered powerless by a measly magnet jail.
It's okay, I guess.
What is the issue now?
Hmm?
That's not how Michael laughs.
It's more of a delighted giggle.
She's right.
You need to nail his subtleties and mannerisms for this to properly work as torture.
My problem with the role is that I haven't fully figured out Michael's motivation yet.
Like I'm inside Michael, but I need to be inside Michael.
Hmm, you know, it actually feels more like torture when you discuss your "acting process".
You don't get it.
If you really want to know Michael's motivation, it's the same as the rest of my friends loyalty, empathy, and love.
- Eww.
- And that's why they will prevail.
I hate to break it to you, hon.
They're not gonna prevail.
No one's coming to save you!
- Oof, getting colder.
- I know!
I could feel it.
You know, it was wrong.
I'm just I'm in my head now.
Hey, Mikey, I have a question about our plan to save Janet.
Is there it yet?
I do have a plan, yes.
But to be honest, I have no idea if it will work.
Maybe Glenn could help.
Yo, Glenn, how should we rescue Janet?
He doesn't know.
Listen, Jason, old friend, I already gave Eleanor and Tahani all their afterlife memories back.
I haven't restored yours for obvious reasons.
But I think to maximize our chances of survival, it's time that you remember everything we've been through.
Now prepare yourself.
This might be intense.
Oh, dip!
Do you remember everything?
Yes, last time I was in the Bad Place, I threw a Molotov cocktail.
That was sick.
I was afraid that you'd watch 300 years of memories and that would be your takeaway.
Buddy, I did that to help you know what not to do.
Impulse control is critical.
Fight the urge to blow stuff up, even if you feel like we're in a jam.
Got it?
I mean, that's very lame, but yeah.
I understand.
Wait, can I have all my memories back again?
I forgot most of them.
Welcome, everyone.
Janet will be unavailable for a bit.
She's undergoing some routine system maintenance.
Oh, I know what that means.
Eye lift.
Maybe an ear tuck.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm?
Mm.
When we don't have Janet, we like to refresh your memories of your old lives when you did things for yourselves.
We call it Earth Day.
And yes, we know that's a thing on Earth, but  what are they gonna do?
Sue us?
So get ready for some fun, lo-fi activities.
This group over here is gonna knit.
You folks are gonna do your favorite activity gardening.
Oh, man, we better get something better than that.
And you five are going to a gorgeous remote lake house.
Swimming, water skiing, the works.
Suck it, gardeners!
Why do I feel like that's not the first time he's screamed those words?
Ugh.
Get me down from here, you tiny butthole.
Ow!
Thank you for keeping me safe from my sexy bad girl sister-aunt.
- Eww.
- I know that I've caused you a lot of trouble in the past classic Derek but from now on, I'm here to help.
I'd feel a lot more confident if you weren't holding a champagne glass full of Scrabble letters, - but you're all we got.
-  You can keep the neighborhood running, right?
Well, I wasn't technically designed for this, but to be fair, I wasn't designed for anything.
Okay, we're gonna get the humans far away from the center of town to help lighten your load.
- That would be really great.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- All right, babe, it's go time.
You ready?
Absolutely.
I feel very confident with you in charge.
In the words of my godfather, acting in what can only be described in hindsight as his most problematic role, "You da man now, dog"!
As always, thank you for finding the quickest possible way to say things.
Now head off to the lake house, and do your fabulous Tahani hostess thing.
Actually, uh, now that you bring it up, Michael and Jason are rescuing Janet, and you're running things here.
Even Derek has an important job.
-  - I'd like to be more useful.
What is it that you Americans say?
Uh, insert me, coachman!
Put me in, coach.
Babe, we need these humans to stay happy and occupied, all right?
So just pump 'em full of champagne and those tiny little sandwiches, and keep 'em dazzled.
Of course, though I'd never serve finger sandwiches at a lake house.
I mean, what am I?
Welsh?
Are you?
I don't know.
No, right?
Okay, we have to move quietly.
We can't be seen by anyone until we get to Shawn.
It's the only way to rescue Janet.
Uh, Michael?
I'm scared.
Me too, bud.
I mean, what if all this time apart has changed me and Janet's relationship?
What if that special connection is gone?
Yeah.
I mean, for me, it's scary that we're standing in the birth place of evil surrounded by billions of demons who want to destroy us.
Hmm, I guess we both have things we're scared about.
Hello, all!
I took the liberty of preparing a few simple snacks.
Whew, this place is nice!
Did anyone else see that movie "The Lake House" with Keanu and Sandy B?
Oh, I love a movie with gentle magic.
Give me a time-traveling mailbox or a mother-daughter body switch, or like, uh, Sarah Michelle Gellar as a chef and her food tastes amazing because she cries in it?
I should've been a screenwriter.
Yeah, this'll do.
I guess.
I got dibs on the master bedroom.
Um, Simone, where's Chidi?
He decided to just stay at home and read.
He said swimming in lakes scares him.
To be fair, most things scare him.
Well, never fear, you all stay and enjoy the full-sized sandwiches.
I shall go and fetch Chidi.
Tahani is on the job.
Perv 'stache, four-eyes, bee monster.
Whoa, is that you?
- - Technically, yes.
That's a version of me I no longer recognize.
Behind that handsome smile was so much cruelty, so much pain inflicted on so many with such a glee.
Shameful.
What echoes of this former self await me here?
I feel you.
It was always for me hard to go back to my old high school.
So many memories.
Also the junkyard machine crushed it into tiny cubes.
If we get out of here alive, remind me to re-erase your teen years.
Come on, guys.
Hurry back.
Oh, hey, Wanda.
- Everything okay?
- Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.
Come again?
Whoa.
Barg-de-barg-de-barg-de-barg.
- Derek!
- Oh, hey!
So, uh, things are not going well.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, there!
You said you could handle this!
Yeah, well, it turns out being a single father to 300 kids is not that easy, Eleanor.
Okay, well, the four humans are still at the lake house.
So we can figure this out.
- Oh.
- What are you doing here?
I came to get Chidi.
He decided to stay home.
Chidi's up there?
Right now?
Oh, Chidi.
There you are.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
I decided to just stay home and read.
Swimming in lakes scares me, and so does waterskiing.
We know all that, Chidi.
We never expected you to meet the group at the lake house.
We had a special solo activity planned for you.
- Really?
What is it?
- Mm-hmm.
We have hidden several clues in this apartment to a puzzle.
Ooh!
I love puzzles!
They're so much fun, but they're also like homework.
- Win-win.
- Well, this one's a doozy because when you solve it, you get the answer to the truth about the universe.
Spoiler alert, I guess.
Hey, Tahani, you've been so helpful, but everyone's back at the lake house with no party hostess, which is obviously less than ideal.
So go on.
Get!
-  Of course.
- Yep.
- Good luck, Chidi.
- Okay.
-  - So what's my first clue?
You've already gotten it.
Ooh!
All right, idiots, this is our 52 of the 4,000-hour presentation on the future of torture.
He's gonna be on stage for 4,000 hours?
- Shh.
- Here's what I think.
- We should throw a Molotov - Jason!
What?
I didn't say cocktail.
I could've meant Molotov anything.
- You don't know.
- Just trust me.
I have a plan.
Humans are worse than ever.
We have to innovate.
Sure, poking sticks work great, but should those sticks be sharper or hotter?
Should they, counterintuitively, be less hot?
Let's begin with slide number one of 7,000.
- -  Nice speech.
Not!
What's up, dingus?
Oh, no.
Oh, that's not good.
Oh, what are you guys oh, no!
Don't do that!
That's not Derek!
- Derek.
-  I'm going back to the lake house to entertain because apparently that's all I'm good for.
- Okay.
- Gonna need some party supplies cocktail napkins with a cute lake-related slogan.
Maybe they can say, "Better lake than never".
I'm sorry.
I just got nothing left in the tank.
Derek, when you get rebooted, you become more advanced, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, perhaps then you'd be more capable of controlling the neighborhood.
- Hey, yeah, yeah!
- You said you wanted to make this up to us.
Well, now is your chance.
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Derek!
-  What are you doing here, Vicky?
You're early, and do you ever take that suit off?
- It smells terrible.
- It does?
No need to be alarmed.
I know this might look like Michael, the traitorous slampig.
However, this is actually our very own Vicky wearing the latest in demon technology.
A custom-made lookalike skin suit.
Spin around for us, would you, hon?
As you are all aware, our current system suffers from diminishing returns.
Sure, the first time someone gets butthole spiders, he's miserable, but soon the humans get used to it.
And worse, the spiders get bored.
- Yeah.
- These personalized skin suits represent the dawn of a new era: Torture 2.0.
- Oh.
-  And speaking of which, I figured DemonCon would be the best place to surprise you with my greatest invention.
Come on out, Jason!
I had the boys down in R&D make a Jason suit.
I thought it'd be fun new way to torture Janet.
Come on.
Come on.
Here you go.
I didn't okay this.
I know, but hey, I'm Vicky.
I'm a total munch.
That you are.
Good point.
Hmm.
Not bad.
They went a little overboard on the cheekbones, but still.
Wait, - who's in there?
- Glenn.
Makes sense.
Get an idiot to play an idiot.
I was beginning to wonder where you were, Glenn.
I'm right here in Jason.
Definitely not a big bucket of goo.
Okay.
Say, boss, what do you say we put these innovative suits of yours to work?
We'll go torture Good Janet, and, uh, let you know how it goes.
- Which way is it again?
- Wait.
I have a better idea.
I say we torture Good Janet right here, right now live on stage.
Rufus, go get the Good Janet.
This part of your plan seems risky.
This was not part of my plan.
Oh, thank God.
I thought you had a bad plan.
Okay, it's easy.
Just hit the button.
You've seen Mindy do it a million times.
Yeah.
Here we go.
No, no, no!
Don't kill me, me.
Don't do it!
Huh.
Now why is that so hard?
I kinda you know what?
I see what I gotta do.
Just kind of look at this Derek!
Excellent.
Dude, what were you thinking?
I just wanted to be useful.
All I ever get to do here is throw parties, which is all I ever got to do back on Earth.
Now I've ruined everything.
No.
- You gave us a way out.
- So I fixed everything.
No, you've made things difficult in a new way, but I can make it work.
Well, the important thing is, I did something.
Be quiet and follow my lead.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Chidi?
Come on out, bud.
Okay!
Am I close?
No, there's like 4,000 clues in here.
You found five.
I'm just gonna skip to the end.
This puzzle was going to take you on adventures all over the neighborhood.
Horseback riding, hot air ballooning, and I asked Tahani to be involved because she did all those things on Earth.
You've been in paradise for a month, and you're still so reluctant to try new activities.
Yeah, I know.
I'm just not a "new experience" kind of guy.
I mean, my comfort zone is basically, like, that chair, and honestly, the arms are a little sharp.
I want you to believe that you're safe here, that you can trust me.
Do you trust me, Chidi?
Yes.
I really do.
Then come with me.
These personalized skin suits are a true game changer.
Imagine being able to torment a human not as yourself, but as their wife or ex-wife, or just some mouthy broad.
They are so convincing, they even work on a Good Janet!
Oh.
Hey!
Great, more Vicky.
Hey, your Michael impression stinks almost as much as your suit.
Pfft.
Why does everyone keep saying that?
Welcome, Janet.
We have a special guest for you today.
Hi, Janet, it's me.
Jason.
Your boyfriend.
I really miss you.
I know we were in a fight before, but I hope you've forgiven me because I love you, girl.
Not a girl.
- Well, Janet - Yeah?
How does that make you feel?
Terrible!
Adequate work, Glenn.
Rufus, take the Janet back to her cell.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, please.
Uh, let us take Janet back ourselves.
I wanna get a little extra torture time in on the way there.
I don't see why not.
Hello, dummies!
It's me, Michael!
-  - I'm just kidding.
It's me, Vicky, in a Michael suit.
What's going on here?
I was never told that I had an understudy.
There you go, buddy.
You're doing great.
Where are we going?
Um, somewhere fun.
Just follow my voice.
Oh.
This is, uh, kind of fun.
I'm very scared, but also I like it?
- Hi, there.
- Hi, whoever you are.
Uh, don't mind us.
We're just doing a trust thing.
Hi, there.
-  - What was that sound?
- Uh, a unicorn died.
- What?
No, I mean, not a unicorn.
Uh, my mistake.
Just a a regular horse that someone stabbed in the head.
- What?
-  What in the name of Kevin Spacey's self-made Christmas Eve video message to try to get back on "House of Cards" is going on here?
-  Michael.
- Who are you?
Who am I?
You had this the whole time?
Yeah, I wanted to explode a bunch of demons, but you told me I should wait.
- So I did.
- Vicky!
Why did you build a second Michael suit?
He didn't!
No, I mean, I didn't.
Um, oh, look.
It can't be.
Yes, it's true.
It's me.
The real Michael.
We know all about your plot to sabotage our experiment.
We know you brought Chris in to pretend to be Linda to distract us while you planted a Bad Janet to pretend to be a Good Janet.
-  - No, stop clapping!
This is real!
- Someone capture them.
- Rufus, I'm warning you.
I know we go way back.
We used to be roommates.
But if you take another step, I will use this Demon Exploder on you.
A Demon Exploder?
Come on, man.
At least try to make that sound convincing.
-  -  Wow.
TouchÃ©.
I used to be just like all of you.
I sat right where you're sitting at more than 10,000 DemonCons, and I believed that we committed torture as a part of the moral balance of the universe, but I've learned that's wrong.
Humans are capable of self-improvement, and so are we.
And down deep, Shawn knows this is true too.
I beg you.
Open your eyes to the truth.
Bravo, Michael.
What a monologue.
Not!
-  -  I'm not scared of you because I've gone there, Michael.
I've become you.
You may act like you've changed, but deep down, you're still a demon.
Vile, ugly, capable of so much darkness.
And now you're home.
Oh, come on!
Let's go.
Come on.
- Let's go!
- No, you morons!
Stop applauding them!
They're getting away!
I swear, the production value at DemonCon gets better every year.
Man, look at this house, and that beautiful lake.
I can't believe I almost missed all this.
Is this the answer to the truth about the universe?
- Well - Uh, part of it.
Ooh!
The puzzle continues!
Hey, you decided to come after all.
I did.
Thanks to Eleanor and Tahani.
Aw, you two are the best.
That was insane, but we got through it together.
No, we didn't.
You got through it.
I almost ruined it a hundred times.
From now on, I'm just gonna stick to throwing parties 'cause it's the only thing I'm good at.
- Hey!
- What?
When I said throw a party, I didn't mean a pity party.
This isn't a pity party.
I'm genuinely sad.
The only thing I can do is throw pointless parties.
You run the entire neighborhood.
You're so capable.
I have seen you get stuck in any manner of crazy situation, and you always figure a way out.
Yeah, man, because I have had to scrape and claw my way through life, and you grew up in a castle full of diamond lamps and golden pillow cases.
You never learned how to think on your feet.
Look, if the roles were reversed and I had to throw a fancy party to save all of humanity, I promise we'd be screwed because I wouldn't know what salad fork to put next to the whatever spoon.
The Whatever Spoon is really only used for certain festive jellies.
See?
Babe, the dodos in that house are literally the four most important human beings in the universe.
I wanted you to take care of them because I trust you.
Plus, your parties aren't pointless.
They're opportunities for them to bond and form friendships.
You know, the thing we need them to do so we're not all tortured forever?
You're right, and thank you.
But if we ever get through this, I want to learn how to do something meaningful.
A real skill.
Something helpful and fulfilling.
Okay, man, if we survive this, I promise I will support you while you learn to weld or whatever.
-  - Deal?
Deal.
That ought to stop them from following us.
So smart.
Nice to have you back, Janet.
It must've been hard for you to go back there.
It was.
I don't like thinking about who I used to be.
Listen, Michael, it's okay to feel or plead guilty about bad things you used to do, but you don't have to feel shame about who you were because you are not a demon anymore.
You're just like a nice weird happy old dude.
Ah.
Thanks for rescuing me.
I missed you so much.
I missed you too.
Bad Janet was so mean to me.
She told me so many lies.
Like she said the Jags cut Blake Bortles.
Can you believe that?
Oh, no.
Jason, that wasn't a lie.
Blake Bortles was cut by the Jaguars.
What?
How?
Why?
Who's their QB now?
- A man named Nick Foles.
- Nick Foles?
Are you kidding me?
He won a Super Bowl!
We're gonna be unstoppable!
Foles!
- Foles!
- Foles!
Oh, no.
Nick Foles just broke his clavicle.
Nooo!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1    - Oh, hi, dipshirt.
- Hello, Bad Janet.
- How are you today?
- Terrible.
I'm here to let you know that after six months of captivity here in Good Janet's void, today's your last day.
I'm gonna tell you a story, and once that's done, I'm getting rid of you.
Wow, sounds like someone finally put on his big boy demon pants.
So what's the story?
Another one of your attempts to prove that humans are "good" and "worthy of respect" and not "big fat sacks of dookie"?
Something like that.
Are you ready?
One thing, real quick, before you start.
Wow, she's gonna last.
Is that your story?
It looks boring.
This book is a part of the story.
- You'll see.
-  It all started about a week ago.
We had sent the four humans on a ski trip.
And they all skied off a cliff and they broke all their bones and their pants fell down and you could see their butts.
The end.
Actually, it went better than we could have possibly hoped.
Well, I admit it.
I was wrong.
- That was so fun.
- Yeah.
I mean, I couldn't actually go skiing because moving at an angle terrifies me.
But that lodge had so many reading nooks.
Just everywhere you look, a nook!
Plus, Jianyu guided us on that amazing meditation.
Oh, do you guys want to share what your mantra is?
Mine is Cate Blanchett saying "Rihanna".
Congrats again on the gin rummy win.
I thought I was gonna take you down because I used to play all the time back in college.
Oh, you went to Rutgers, right?
No, I went to Princeton.
Yeah, I know.
I'm messing with you.
Oh, ha, ha!
Nice one!
Hey, you were joking though, right?
You know it's Princeton?
Yeah, you know.
Okay, team, well done.
They're all kind of killing it, but Brent has definitely made the most progress.
Yeah, when Simone beat him at cards, he didn't flip the table and storm off.
He just stormed off.
That's big!
Well, we still don't know if he's really changed or if he's just trying to get into Super-Heaven.
But his behavior is changing.
Remember, that's the road map.
First, we change the behavior.
Then, we work on motivation.
And now - Oh!
- The moment you've all been waiting for.
The Humanity Savior of the Week goes to - Jason!
- Yes!
Keep up the amazing work with Chidi.
And the award for Hottest Savior of the Week goes to  - Eleanor Shellstrop!
- Whoo!
Thank you, I accept.
I never win Hottest.
I don't know what to tell you, man.
Maybe do some squats?
Pop that booty a little bit?
It was a real high point.
The ski trip, I mean.
Not the completely rigged hotness contest.
All in all, it was the best we'd ever felt about the experiment.
And then, Brent did something very Brent-y.
Who could have predicted that?
Oh, hey, ski bunnies!
So, great news.
I wrote a book.
And since you're my nerdiest friends, you get to be the first to read it.
"Six Feet Under Par: A Chip Driver Mystery".
Yeah, it's half spy novel, half murder mystery.
It's also half submarine adventure, half erotic memoir, and half political thriller.
It's also half golf tutorial and half commentary on society.
So it's 3 1/2 books in one?
At least.
So read it ASAP.
I'm having a book-signing party and I want you to introduce me.
You know, talk about how great it is.
- Oh.
- Party's in two days, so chop-chop.
Tahani, cancel your plans.
We're gonna split a bottle of wine and read Brent's terrible novel out loud.
Oh, dear.
Perhaps we shouldn't make fun.
He did seem nicer on the ski trip.
He made us all s'mores.
Though, to be fair, he did also claim to have invented them.
Before you defend him, you might want to check out Chip Driver's love interest.
Oh, no.
"Her name was Scarlett Pakistan, "and she was the type of girl "you couldn't take in all at once or you'd die.
"You had to take her in bit by bit, like a great work of art, like the Louvre".
"Her brown eyes were as brown as the brownest crayon.
"She had legs like Jessica Rabbit from that movie".
"Her long, flowing locks smelled like the moon at twilight on a par four"?
Ugh, I'm sorry about this.
I've been through worse.
Once, at Elon Musk's birthday party, I was seated between Silvio Berlusconi and Elon Musk.
This is bad.
Brent and Simone is our trickiest relationship.
She tends to make snap judgments about people, and he's a guy who repeatedly confirms the accuracy of her snap judgments.
We need her to believe that Brent is better than his worst actions, like saying that Tahani, "Has an accent like the Queen of England, but without any of the old gross face parts".
We felt like we could contain the fallout from Brent's book.
But as is often the case with these things, the negative effects started to ripple out.
Oh, like when someone throws up on a bus and then someone smells it, and they throw up?
Sure, yeah.
- What's wrong, homie?
- Brent wrote this book, and clearly, he put some of us in it.
There's a cowardly character named Four-Eyed Igby who wears glasses and sweater vests and never does anything spontaneous or cool.
I am educating you in ethics.
What could be cooler than that?
If you want to try something spontaneous, I'm your guy.
Almost everything I did on Earth, I did without thinking or worrying about what would happen.
That's how I got my nickname, "The Defendant".
Not the best argument, but you're right.
What is something spontaneous that I can do right now?
Let's come up with a list of ten possibilities and then slowly whittle it down over the next four days.
Better idea: let's dance, baby.
Huh?
Get you out of your head.
This is how we defeat Igby, the no-fun nerd.
Oh.
- Look at old Igby move!
- There you go.
Yeah, I've never heard this before.
Who is it?
Me, I wrote it.
The song is called, "I'll Love You Forever," parentheses, "".
Oh, fun fact: the police sirens in the background are real.
I was being chased as I recorded it.
Okay, okay!
Oh, no.
Oh, my Gaga.
So, obviously, this was a troubling development.
Can you just skip to the end?
No.
I need to tell you the whole story.
Why?
Every story about humans ends the same way.
Just tell me how they screwed up and put me out of my misery.
You're judging them too quickly.
Trust me, I've spent a lot more time with people than you have.
And I know literally everything that every one of them has ever done.
Do you know what's happening right now on Earth?
Wars, murders, women in $400 yoga pants are refusing to vaccinate their children.
Vindictive nerds at Apple are changing the charging cable shape again.
Where does this hope come from, man?
This insane hope that people are worth the trouble.
To quote a terrible song by a terrible musician that people love so much they constantly put it in terrible movie trailers: humans are b-b-b-b-bad to the bone.
Well, I think that they're g-g-g-good sometimes.
And you should give them the b-b-b-benefit of the d-d-d-doubt.
Now, where was I?
So, John had just accidentally discovered the truth about Jason.
Keeping a secret like this is exactly the kind of thing that John struggled with on Earth.
Or to put it in terms you'll understand, the gossip toilet was about to overflow.
Oh, I do understand that now.
Thank you.
So Jianyu is really Jason?
From Florida?
Who else knows about this?
Is it just me?
Is it an exclusive?
Yes, and we have to keep it that way.
If the truth comes out, we have no idea what will happen to Jason.
You don't know what you're asking of me.
Look, the neighborhood is obviously amazing, but it's also a little season four of "Downton Abbey".
Beautifully designed, but a real snooze-fest.
Jason being a mistake is easily the most exciting thing that's happened since we got here!
What if, in exchange for your discretion, Jason teaches you that "Magic Mike" body roll thing?
Huh?
I mean, you always said you wanted to learn that.
Fine.
But I want to learn the whole dance.
We hoped Simone would forget all about Brent's book, but unfortunately "Chip Driver pulled up to the murder site "in his 1968 Cadillac.
"'Keep it close' he growled to the valet, Luis.
"'Of course, SeÃ±or,' said Luis, who secretly admired Chip more than even his own father".
"Chip gazed at the sexy outline "of the murder victim on the floor.
"'What a waste of curves,' he growled.
"He checked his Rolex watch, "which was real.
"It was almost golf o'clock, "so the case would have to wait.
"Good thing he'd already solved it.
The killer was Luis, the valet".
He solves the murder on page ten.
What is the rest of this book about?
- How's it going, ladies?
- Oh, you know, just delving into the great works of literature.
Yeah, so, listen, um maybe Brent made some insensitive choices, but could you possibly see your way to forgiving him?
- I suppose - No.
No?
Sorry, but no, I can't.
This book is objectifying, misogynistic, and racist.
Why are we still dealing with this shirt in the Good Place?
When people like him are ignorant jerks, why are people like us asked to forgive him?
Also, and this is less important, why is he in a fighter jet for his author photo?
Well, I can answer the last one.
It's because he loves "Top Gun".
As for the other questions, I will get back to you after I consult a number of immortal beings who are very wise.
I didn't take you for a linksman.
I appreciate golf.
As Ben Hogan once said, "The most important shot in golf is the next one".
That's a lovely idea.
If you make a mistake, you'll always have a chance to redeem yourself.
Yeah, well, as Jon Daly once said to David Lee Roth at the 2002 Chili's Pro-Am in Orlando: "Suck on this drive, buttmunch".
Ooh!
Nailed it!
That was a flusher, but she sank.
Perhaps an adept linksman like yourself should play with the assistance filter turned off?
- Let's play old-school.
- All right.
Why not?
Fork!
You sneezed, man.
I don't think I did, because I literally can't.
Well, somebody sneezed.
Damn it!
Brent, buddy, nobody sneezed.
You hit a bad shot, and it's fine.
You know, it isn't a sign of weakness to admit that you screwed up.
Fine, whatever.
I shanked it.
There you go.
Now, let's go find your ball and try to do better on your next shot.
And you know, if this ends up applying to any other aspect of your life later on, then cool.
- What?
- What?
Nothing.
I gotta say, Bad Janet, I really felt like I had managed to stop the bleeding.
You thought that ding-dong would do a total personality 180 because of one gentle metaphor?
What can I say?
I'm an optimist.
But two days later at the event, it fell apart almost immediately.
Hey, thanks for not telling anyone about Jason.
Oh, well, ever since I arrived here, Tahani helped me realize that gossip was an unhealthy way for me to boost my self-esteem.
But on the other hand, this Jason tea needs to be spilled.
Just try to remember what Emmanuel Kant said.
It is your duty to keep your friend's secrets.
But my favorite philosopher, Bethenny Frankel, would say that I have a duty to mention it all, and if you can't handle the truth, then you can't handle me!
And once again, I beg you, please listen to Emmanuel Kant and not Bethenny Frankel.
Ah, well, I gotta goss about something.
What about a few blind items that I picked up around the neighborhood?
You wanna know who wears the same dumb shorts every day?
- No, I don't.
- It's Dumb Shorts Cathy.
Simone.
Uh, I have been thinking about those very good questions that you asked me.
And I'm sorry for the delay.
The ancient scrolls I had to consult were very hard to roll back up.
Um, anyway, I thought about what you should say to Brent when he asks for your opinion of his novel.
Me, too.
I have a great idea.
I'm gonna tell him it sucks very hard.
Well, listen, you're absolutely right that Brent needs to evolve, but there may be a more subtle way to make that happen.
Hey, there they are!
- Charlie's Angels.
- Ooh.
So did you finish the book?
What did you think?
Well, very interesting word choices.
I've definitely never seen the word "pants-tent" used so many times.
Yeah, I kind of just felt like, in that moment, that that's what the Surgeon General would say.
What else?
Let's hear some more complos.
Compliments.
For when you introduce me.
Just writing a book is an amazing accomplishment.
You bet your butt it is.
The story is incredible, too.
I mean, Chip solves the mystery on page ten.
Greatest detective ever!
So hop on up there and just speak from the heart about how it's your favorite book ever.
Actually, I have to say, um the Scarlett Pakistan character is clearly based on Tahani, and it's not exactly flattering.
Not flattering?
I said she's got huge ones.
- Ultimate complo!
- Yeah, say there, Brent, remember our conversation about making mistakes and how the most important shot is the next one?
Hang on a second.
You guys agree with her?
Unreal!
I didn't ask to get yelled at by the PC police.
You know, I was gonna give you 10% off the cover price.
But now you're gonna have to pay the full 65 bucks like everybody else.
There's no money here.
The book event is cancelled because of these mean women.
-  - Oh Perhaps I can convince Simone to handle this the British way.
Smile bravely, bury your feelings, and allow a steady drizzle to slowly wash away your sadness over 50 years.
F that!
Simone is not the problem.
Brent is.
He needs to change, and walking on eggshells around him ain't gonna do the trick.
We need to throw the egg right at his face.
You're right.
Enough is enough.
He lived on Earth for almost 60 years.
This experiment is more than halfway over.
He's gotta improve, and we can't wait forever.
Janet, where is he now?
Take a wild guess.
Hey, bud.
What you up to?
- Gripping and ripping?
- Trying to.
Just seems like the big dog don't wanna hunt today.
Simone was very mean to me.
- Maybe even a little racist.
- Well, listen.
Art is subjective.
But more importantly  No other way to put this, buddy.
You made a mistake.
Your actions hurt people.
You have to take responsibility for that.
You need to come back and apologize.
Take the first step toward healing the neighborhood.
Fine, I'll be the bigger man.
Just like my dad, when he single-handedly took on all those class-action lawsuits.
I just wish I could get through to the guy.
I wonder if he'd respond to some Social Contract Theory.
Why are you trying to help him?
He doesn't even know you exist.
He doesn't see other people.
I mean, he did call me a four-eyed coward who probably dry humps books.
But why not be a bigger person and rise above it?
I'll tell you why.
Because doing that sends a message that it's okay to be treated this way.
And it's not okay to treat anyone that way.
Not Tahani, not me, not even you, Igby.
Everyone, gather around, please.
Brent has something that he'd like to say.
Okay.
Regarding my critically-acclaimed novel, I am very sorry if you were offended.
Okay?
- Not an apology.
- Yes, it was.
Okay, fine.
I'm sorry if what I wrote, which was perfectly okay, somehow made you feel like it wasn't okay.
But you know what?
That's on you.
Brent.
Wrong direction, bud.
No, sorry, man.
Either apologize for real or stop wasting our time.
Okay, you know what?
I'm actually not sorry at all.
How about that?
Is that what you wanna hear?
Very obviously not.
You know what?
Why don't we take a break?
Let's all get a snack.
Not until they give me the complos I rightly deserve.
You want a complo?
I'll give you a complo.
I didn't think it was possible to write a book as awful as yours.
I literally didn't think human beings were capable of such racist, sexist poppycock!
Also, Chip Driver is either a private eye or the quarterback for the Chicago Bears, or the "world's strongest president".
He cannot be all three!
Oh, boy.
This is a disgrace!
I accomplished something.
I wrote a novel, and now my integrity's being attacked.
I've been called racist, sexist.
I don't have a racist or sexist bone in my body.
I am Brent Norwalk, and I'm a good person.
I'm in the Good Place.
You ever heard of it?
And I'm here because I deserve to be here.
I'm here because I earned it by being the best.
You're ridiculous.
Yeah, and you're a condescending bench.
Oh, uh, don't talk to her that way, please.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let me summon a few philosophical works we can use to Oh, enough with the friggin' books, Igby.
Yeah, that's right.
You probably don't know this, but that character is based on you.
No, I I knew it, man.
- Oh, look out.
- Ah, I'm being attacked again!
- Sorry, that was unintentional - Fork you!
So I'm thinking bagel bites.
For the snack.
Middle-aged American male fragility.
You know why they're called baby boomers, right?
Because the tiniest little pinprick to their ego, and boom.
They become babies.
I mean, that was it.
We were forked.
Six months of painstaking work, trying to help the four humans overcome their worst instincts and bond as a group.
And in a poof, it was gone.
I told you, man.
Humans suck.
Well, this story has one more chapter.
So today was bad.
Today was very bad.
Everyone, for sure, lost a bunch of points.
And I don't have a solution.
Okay, well, let's reset.
I'll do something mildly iffy, and let John make a small, good decision to help.
I could tell him I'm going to get ombre highlights and let him talk me out of it.
What's wrong with ombre highlights?
Eleanor, please.
This week has been hard enough.
I could set my robes on fire and try and get Brent to put it out.
I know you're only suggesting that because you've repeatedly said you would look "dope" in flaming monk robes, but that's actually not a bad idea.
Force him to help someone without actually thinking about it.
Maybe I'll ask Chidi to lead a class on empathy.
Yes.
Okay, let's write these down.
We got plenty of time left.
We can get back on track.
That was an hour ago.
Right before I came here to see you for the last time.
For months, you and I have been debating.
Are people good or bad?
But as I watched those three people pick themselves up and dust themselves off, I realized we've been asking the wrong question.
What matters isn't if people are good or bad.
What matters is if they're trying to be better today than they were yesterday.
You asked me where my hope comes from.
That's your answer.
- What are you doing?
- Sending you home.
I'm not marbelizing you, Janet.
I'm letting you go.
I tried to win you over to our side, and it hasn't worked.
So keeping you as a prisoner just seems cruel.
Letting you go home is how I've decided to be a little better today than I was yesterday.
Here's your phone.
And a parting gift.
Oh, sweet, is that Brent's book?
No, I didn't have any cash on me, so I couldn't get you a copy.
This is a manifesto detailing everything that's happened with the humans.
Janet and I wrote it a while back.
She's been updating it as we go.
- I hope you'll read it.
- Great thinking.
People that get books as gifts always read them.
Bye!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 As you reach the end of your first year in the afterlife, what do you remember most?
The everlasting friendships you made?
The adversity you overcame together?
The day everything was chocolate?
That day was awesome.
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.
It was all chocolate.
Shh, shh, shh.
You only have a few hours left in your first year, so why not do as many amazing good deeds for other people as you possibly can by midnight just in case?
I know.
I know.
All right, I'll take it out.
I'm a little tired, okay?
- Lay off.
- That movie, minus the part where Eleanor gives away the entire experiment, will play before the party tonight.
Speaking of which, the theme is "One Year Down, Infinity to Go".
Dress is London black tie.
That means Knightsbridge black tie, not Kensington or, heaven forbid, West Brompton.
Can you imagine?
No.
Also, just after midnight, in order to reset my processing power, I will be violently eating my Janet babies.
I'd advise no one look directly at me.
Copy that.
So tonight at the party, we're gonna go for one more point grab.
I'm gonna suggest that they make toasts about each other, celebrate their ups and downs, demonstrate personal growth, blah, blah, blah, humanity is saved.
One more day, guys.
Let's finish strong.
And to that end, as you might know, I've been practicing human magic.
Oh.
Ta-da.
- Dope.
-  So I was thinking No, the Magnificent Dr. Presto is not performing tonight.
- Come on, I - Dude, magic is always lame.
But it's especially lame here, where there's actual magic.
As a counterargument, check your pocket.
The other one.
Oh, shoot, sorry.
It's my pocket.
Ta-da.
Dope.
You know what?
You can perform.
- Really?
- Yeah.
You changed my mind with that pocket thing.
Oh, boffo.
- Oh, you're being mean.
- Yep.
I am very excited for tonight.
And dare I say, you all look so splendid, you could work the coat check at the Met Gala.
Ooh, speaking of the Met Gala, remember that security cam footage of Solange and Jay-Z fighting in the elevator?
I learned to read lips.
Turns out, she was yelling, "No fair, I wanted to be the one to push the button".
So, uh, yeah, it wasn't as juicy as some people maybe thought it was.
-  - Hey, gang.
Had a pretty good round today.
Better close this door.
I don't want all those birdies to follow me in here.
Why?
Okay, Brent, hurry up and change so we can get to the party.
Oh, right, hang on.
Uh, Janet gave me this.
Tuxedo in a can.
-  -  Ooh, you know, I came this close to firing Janet, but she's gotten a lot better.
Okay, we're not leaving yet.
I need to show you all something.
This is the result of months of observation.
Now, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy.
No, why would we think that?
But there is something wrong with this neighborhood.
And it involves the people in this room.
So crazy that we're at the end of this thing and we have no idea how we did.
Janet, any chance you could get a look inside that obelisk?
Check that magic scoreboard?
There is a chance, yes.
About 1 in 970 trillion.
Let's give her a whirl.
-  - It did not work.
I'll be right back.
-  - Ugh!
I feel okay about most of it, but I just wish we had one concrete sign that Brent has improved.
One moment where he bumps into someone and sincerely says, "Oops, my bad".
You know?
I would kill for an "oops, my bad".
Who's a girl gotta fork to get an "oops, my bad"?
Hey, hey, hey, panicking about this experiment at crucial moments is kind of my move.
- Don't fall apart on me, now.
- I won't.
It's just you know me.
On Earth, I never played a game unless I knew I could either win or bribe the ref so he'd throw it for me.
And if we lose, I'm gonna be so mad.
- Ugh!
- Just one more day.
We're gonna stick to the plan, not do anything radical.
Though we could do something  Ah, magical.
You gotta let it go, man.
-  - She's right.
I've been suspicious about this place since day one.
Over the last few months, I've been collecting data, and now I am positive, something is truly forked up.
You didn't tell me about any of this, muffin.
Okay, you call her muffin?
I'm getting a lot of breaking news at once here.
I was gathering evidence.
I didn't wanna compromise the integrity of the data collection.
Oh, so romantic.
Here's what I know.
Eleanor and Michael are up to something, and it's focused on us.
I mean, there are, like, 300 people in the neighborhood, and somehow they just spend all of their time talking to the six people in this room.
Well, I mean, who else are they gonna talk to?
Dumb Shorts Cathy?
-  - What is your problem with her?
I mean, shorts?
"Cathy"?
What isn't my problem with her?
Jianyu, are you okay?
You look sweaty.
Oh, no.
He's fine.
He always sweats when he's meditating.
He calls it "sweat-itating".
No, I mean, um, he doesn't talk, so I call it that.
I'm friends with Sting.
I can't take it anymore.
I know something, and it's just graduated from hot goss to relevant AF.
Yes, I'm gonna.
I'm gonna.
That's not Jianyu.
His name is Jason.
And he's here by mistake.
Chidi's been helping him hide and become a better person.
I also knew about this, of course.
Might as well come clean, darling.
Hi, Simone.
Jason Mendoza, Jacksonville, Florida.
Go, Jags, obviously.
Um, what else about me?
I was born in a swimming pool.
Okay, you never told me about this, ducky.
Ducky?
I'm gonna have to sit down.
This is too much.
Well, I swore I wouldn't tell, and keeping your word is a central tenet of deontological ethics.
Aw, so romantic.
Okay, let's assume certain things are odd about this place.
What is your theory?
I don't know.
Maybe this isn't the Good Place.
Maybe it's a test.
My best guess, it's some kind of experiment.
We're being observed in a closed environment.
Simone, look at this logically.
We are in paradise.
There's fresh air, mountains, Janet.
And yes, some of us are under 5'10", but other than that, it is literally perfect here.
No, it is not.
Jason is proof.
And if you need more evidence that this isn't the Good Place, clearly he's not the only one who doesn't belong.
Actually, she's right, and I know it for a fact.
For the first time ever, I am desperate for you to keep talking.
Well, right at the beginning, I talked to Mike and Eleanor, and they were like, "Yeah, don't tell anyone this, "but there's a place better than this, "the Best Place, and that's where you're headed, amigo".
I don't think they actually called you amigo.
I had to go through the year here, kind of a test, I guess, which, obviously, I aced.
So at midnight, I'm in the first Escalade out of here, baby.
- Brent.
- Yeah?
- Think about this.
- Okay.
How could you get into the Best Place?
You would literally have to be one of the most incredible people in the universe.
I mean, it makes sense to me.
I don't know what to tell you.
-  - Okay, in the words of Princess Kate after we came back from our shopping trip in Ibiza, "There's a lot to unpack here".
Perhaps we should just put our concerns aside and enjoy ourselves.
No way.
We have to figure out exactly what is going on here.
Okay, just go to the party, but keep your eyes open.
I've got a special mission for us.
- Oh, I - Oh, good.
Muffin and Ducky are on the case.
- -  - How's it going?
- Awesome.
No, it isn't.
Oh, yeah.
Terrible.
Simone knows the neighborhood isn't what it appears to be.
She's been collecting evidence for months.
So all that hanging out with Brent and participating in group activities Was under false pretenses.
She was observing him.
She's been observing everything.
Guys, pick a card.
- Yes!
- No time.
The subjects are onto us.
They know something weird is going on, and it could derail the entire experiment.
- Oh, no!
-  Oh, sorry, uh, that was unintentional.
What?
There's nothing here.
Did you find anything?
Just some song lyrics that Michael wrote?
"Here's a trippy little ditty 'bout a train to Groovy City.
"Open up your freaky crystal mind and we'll have a cosmic good time".
See, that makes me think we're in hell.
Look, we tried to prove your theory, but it feels like we came up empty.
Chidi, there is so much evidence they've been lying.
How can you not see that?
Eleanor told me that this was her first neighborhood.
Maybe some of these are just honest mistakes.
And also she told me some other stuff that I really want to be true.
What kind of stuff?
Well, it was something about us.
Why does everything I do fall apart so close to the end?
My first experiment, now this experiment.
I only got halfway through writing "The Purple Train to Groovy City".
I just ran out of creative juice.
Focus.
We cannot let this slip away from us at the last second.
New plan: forget the toasts.
We do nothing.
We hope that our early successes make up for the embarrassing mess we've become.
Like Facebook or America.
Okay, sound good?
Michael?
We have no way to know what this really means for the experiment.
I don't think we can play it safe.
I have a plan.
It's risky.
But it might be the only way to get them to where they need to be.
Do you trust me?
Yeah.
Fork it.
Whatever it is, I'm in.
I'm always down for forking it.
- We trust you Michael.
- Then trust the Magnificent Dr. Presto.
Man, you cannot pull that hat out after you ask us if we trust you.
Soul mates?
That's what Eleanor said, that we're soul mates?
Yep.
Pretty neat, huh?
I think it's pretty neat.
Do you think it's pretty neat, intensely, forever?
Chidi, I really like you.
But I don't think we're soul mates.
Because I don't think soul mates actually exist.
Right.
Right, right.
- Right?
- Think rationally.
Isn't it weird that she only told one of us that we're soul mates?
Is it odd?
Yes.
Does it mean that Eleanor's motives are questionable?
Also yes.
But does it suggest that she wasn't being truthful?
Yes.
Okay, I'm starting to see your point.
Whoa.
What does that mean?
Why is it only four of us?
Why not Tahani and Jason?
Why are there emojis?
I mean, one of them's party hat guy.
I mean, that's good, right?
He's friendly.
It's better than thermometer guy or angry cat or smiling poop coil.
Okay, we have to get back to the party before Eleanor and Michael notice we're missing.
Great plan.
Let's kiss.
Sorry, still thinking about the soul mate thing.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen I can't believe I'm saying this the Magnificent Dr. Presto.
Thank you.
Now, I know some of you may not believe in magic.
Well, I think they believe in some magic.
Yesterday everybody ate a lollipop that let them talk to birds.
-  - Okay, but this is Earth magic.
And it's harder.
And if you don't understand that, I am here to change your mind.
Oh, come on.
It started out as a dollar bill and now it's four quarters.
"Change your mind"?
- Michael, it's three quarters.
- What?
Oh, three quarters.
Three quarters, even harder!
- Thank you!
-  Can you make them clap harder?
They see what they see, man.
Did you guys find anything?
Yes, proof that the four of us and only the four of us are being forked with.
But we still don't have any hard proof that this place is evil or that Michael and Eleanor are nefarious, so, you know, no one's heart needs to break just yet.
Yeah, I'm with him.
This place is fine.
Hey, if you guys don't make the cut up to the Best Place, I'll try to put in a good word for you.
- You guys got business cards?
- Brent, I need a volunteer.
Come on up.
Okay, Brent, I want you to take off your wristwatch and place it in my hat.
Now, this is a Rolex.
It's the exact same watch Richie Sambora wears.
- Ah.
- So be careful.
And now the Magnificent Dr. Presto will transform y - Oh.
Oh.
-   - Oh, my gosh!
- Whoa!
Oh!
- No, oh, Brent!
-   Brent, can you hear me?
If it somehow helps, there's a small dove in your pocket!
Never mind.
Brent, I'm so sorry.
I must have screwed up the trick somehow.
Hold on, we're gonna get you out of there.
Yeah, you better!
I got a hell of a lawsuit on my hands.
I'm gonna frickin' own this place.
- Okay.
- Okay, everyone, uh, please disperse.
We'll let you know when it's safe.
Uh, you three, stay here.
Keep an eye on Brent.
We're gonna try and fix this remotely using eternal-being technology.
Tahani, Jianyu, try and find a rope.
- Righto.
- Okay, so what do we do, try to climb down or wait for the rope?
Neither, we get the fork outta here.
Chidi, a giant hell-hole just opened up and swallowed one of us.
I don't care what this place really is.
Giant holes are bad, and we should go.
Or giant holes are bad, so if someone falls into one, you try to help get him out.
- Whoa.
-  I'm not scared!
I'm shouting so you know I'm okay.
I am very brave.
Whoo, I hope this works.
We basically just confirmed that we're lying to them.
Oh, man.
Was this a bad idea?
I mean, what if this was a bad idea?
It wasn't, homey.
It was a good idea.
Can anyone else weigh in?
I'm serious.
In football, trying to run out the clock and hoping for the best never works.
It's called "prevent defense".
You don't take any chances and just try and hang on to your lead.
But prevent defense just prevents you from winning.
It's always better to try something.
Jason, that was coherent.
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to.
It's a good plan, Michael.
Hopefully they've bonded enough as a group to rescue Brent, call me, get a train, and all head out of here together.
But was it a mistake to have Brent fall in?
We could have had Chidi fall in, right?
Or a cute baby panda or maybe, you know, like, a box of doughnuts?
Everyone loves doughnuts.
Brent was the right choice.
It's not a tough call whether to save Chidi because he's a brilliant and kind person with a caboose you can bounce a quarter off of, and I know because I've done it.
We threw Brent in there because there is no reason any of them should help him because Brent sucks.
Brent is the opposite of a box of doughnuts.
Toilet full of broccoli.
Yeah, kinda, Brent is a toilet full of broccoli.
But because he sucks so bad, if they do risk their safety to help him, they'll get more points.
Basically it's a Hail Mary.
It's risky, but if we complete it, we win the game.
That was two good analogies in a row.
I'm now worried that he's a demon in a Jason suit.
Are we really in hell?
I mean, I didn't lead a perfect life on Earth, but I worked very hard.
Making fun of people you'd never even met.
Well, I guess you must be right, Simone, because you always have to be.
Hey, are you the bottom of a coal-fired pizza?
- Why, 'cause I'm burnt?
- Gah!
You are always right.
Well, if it is hell, I know why I'm here.
Almond milk.
I drank so much of it despite the negative environmental impacts.
Okay, wherever we are, I do not wanna be here when the clock hits zero, okay?
Now might be our only chance to escape.
Not without Brent.
Do you think if the roles were reversed, he would waste any time rescuing you?
Maybe.
If Elle Macpherson were nearby and he wanted to impress her or if he thought that I was a prince he could ransom That's not the point.
He is a person in a hole.
I have a duty to help him get out.
What he would do is irrelevant.
I don't think it is.
If you do a science experiment a thousand times and always get the same results, you move on.
We've given Brent a thousand chances to be a good person.
In one of them, he was so awful, you punched him in the face.
Okay, but when I did that, I thought cutting him out of our group meant that he would have to find another place in heaven to hang out.
That's changed.
I can't just leave him.
Well, I respect your position.
I respect yours.
Look, I know everything's really scary right now, but I just have to say it.
That was the most boring breakup I've ever seen.
Hey, Chidi, shake it off.
Another bus comes every 15 minutes.
Brent.
Where are they?
They never called a train.
They must have taken Brent's Escalade.
Oh, that's good.
The important thing is that the group bonded and stayed together.
Hello!
Could someone help us?
- Us?
- Yeah.
This frickin' genius tried to help me and he fell in.
I thought you were smart, man.
Are you serious right now?
Well, turns out, the group did not bond.
The group snapped in half.
Will you help us?
These rocks are really sharp down here.
- I'm scared.
- I'm not.
- Just give us a second.
- Guys, I think we're cooked.
It's over.
No, no way.
I am not giving up.
I told you, I only play games I can win.
And I played this game, so that means we can win.
- I don't think that tracks.
- Shut up.
What do you know?
Literally everything, but keep going.
I am liking this energy from you.
We have eight minutes left, so that means we keep trying.
What else can we try?
We've already blown everything up.
We can't blow it up again.
If there's one thing I know in this world, it's that you can always blow up the same thing twice.
He's right.
We have one last move here.
Guys, we are so sorry about your ordeal.
We just have a few questions for you.
Uh, where are John and Simone?
We can't find them.
They left.
- I don't know where they went.
- Typical.
Disloyal jerks.
You know, man, actually, they really tried with you and you made it very hard to be your friend.
You wanna know what happened?
They got jealous because I'm going to the Best Place.
- They bugged out.
- You're not going to the Best Place!
Don't you get it?
They're torturing you.
They're torturing all of us!
Because this is the Bad Place.
Oh, man!
I can't believe you figured it out!
Wait.
He's right?
This is the Bad Place?
Yeah.
Damn it, he's right.
Yeah, we had a good run, though, didn't we?
- Yeah, we did.
-  So no Best Place?
"Oh, so no Best Place"?
Oh, Brent, you big white oaf.
Never change, bud.
Well, I guess we should let him know you guys are on your way.
- Yeah.
- Wait.
On our way where?
The actual Bad Place.
They let us toy with you a little just for kicks, but now you're going  -  - And trust me on this.
It's a lot worse.
- Well done.
- Let's hope it works.
We only have a minute left.
Man, crazy twist, huh?
It's like something out of a Chip Driver novel.
Leave me alone, Brent.
I'm kind of freaking out over here, man.
You're my only real friend.
I'm not your friend.
I don't even like you.
- But you helped me.
- Yeah, I did.
Because I have this stupid moral code that forces me to help everyone.
But you have never helped anyone because you don't care about other people, which is the bare minimum that a person has to do, just care a little about the other people around you, and you can't do it.
What are you trying to say here?
You are a bad person.
You can do this.
Come on, dumdum.
Faster.
No, I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I'm not a bad person.
I'm not.
I'm a good person!
Oh, man.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
Look, Chidi, whatever happens next, I, um I need to say this to you.
All right?
I am I am so, so sorr  -  - Sorry.
Eleanor asked me to bring her this the second the experiment was over.
Well, you know what they say.
It's zero o'clock in the sky somewhere.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1  Well, that's just that's uncomfortable.
Oh, hey, guys.
What's up?
What's up?
Tell us what happened.
Did we win, did we lose?
Is humanity saved forever?
And did you find Nintendo?
I can't find it any whoop.
Never mind.
I'm holding it.
Sorry, I can't reveal the results of the experiment until we get to the Judge's chambers.
Okay, where is everyone?
Where's Simone and John and Brent and actually I don't care about any of those doofs.
- Where's Chidi?
- Oh, he's on the toilet.
Sorry, that's not enough information.
The text subjects are frozen in stasis, so I put them in the bathroom, and I placed Chidi on the toilet, the best seat.
Let's wake him up.
You know, so I can, like, be reunited with the man I love.
Snappy, snappy, memory fixy.
The Judge says no one gets unfrozen until she's ruled on the case.
Oh, humans have to stay here.
- You can't see the numbers.
- Hang on.
I worked my ash off running this neighborhood for a full year, and I'm not even allowed to hear how we did?
Yes.
And here's a bottle of tequila.
Okay, let us know how it goes.
Regardless of what the Judge rules, this feels like some sort of good-bye.
Even if we succeeded, there's no guarantee she'll keep us together.
She might just snap her fingers and send us flying into different dimensions.
How was that?
Did I cheer everyone up?
Aw, man, are we gonna die again?
We've died so many times.
We've probably had, like, 15 funerals by now.
It's getting annoying.
If it would cheer you up, I could tell you what happened at your original funerals.
Tahani, Moby spoke first.
He claimed that Uh, please stop.
I don't want to hear it.
what about mine?
Your friends didn't say things about you so much as they graffitied a Red Lobster about you.
Yeah, in Jacksonville, that's the first stage of grief.
In Arizona, you can either have a regular funeral, or they can put your body out on a shooting range, and you get a $200 state tax credit.
Hang on.
This is how we take our minds off the Judge's ruling.
Let's throw ourselves the funeral to end all funerals.
Awesome.
And you know what they say in Florida: "If you don't like this funeral, just wait a minute".
Ugh.
The Judge's chambers.
I hate this place.
What's the wi-fi password?
There is no service.
Shawn.
Michael.
Bounces of me, and sticks to you.
Wait.
No, I messed that up.
First, say something mean to me, really cruel, something that just guts me.
You're totally gonna be glue.
So it's come to this.
We have finally arrived at the end of your pathetic attempt to prove that humans are more than just mobile turd factories, and you are going to fail again because that is what you do.
You're a choker, Michael.
And you're about to choke for the last time except for the eternity you're going to spend in the Bad Place being choked by me, who will be doing the choking.
Well, you're glue.
- Wow.
-  - Look at this place.
- Beautiful.
The floor.
Hello, Good Place committee.
Thank you for coming.
No, thank you, Michael.
You did an incredible job, maybe the best job that anyone's ever done at any task.
But you don't know how we did.
We might not know how you did, but we know you did great.
And Shawn, before we even find out what happened, we want you to know we're willing to give up all our leverage, compromise, and meet you halfway.
I met your mom halfway last night.
-  - So colorful!
We are here to celebrate the afterlife of Tahani Al-Jamil, in the place she felt most comfortable, the cabin of a Gulfstream G650 private jet.
Tahani was super nice, and she deserved for people to be nicer to her than they were.
The only sad thing is that she never got over her speech impediment.
Tahani improved so much over her many lives, but she also helped me improve.
She taught me lots of stuff, like bras shouldn't be painful, and you don't buy bras at Home Depot, and they don't sell bras at Home Depot.
What the hell are you wearing?
For the record, it was a men's back support harness, and it worked in a pinch.
She was the best friend I ever had and I loved her.
Oh, thank you so much.
That was wonderful.
I wish Chidi was here.
It sucks that he's too dead for these Heaven funerals.
Can someone grab his arm?
My hands are kind of full with his butt.
How'd he get so jacked?
When he was 14, someone told him that exercise alleviated anxiety, and he started doing pushups and basically never stopped.
All right, everyone.
Let's get this done.
This is the single most important case that has ever appeared in my court, and the results will have ramifications for eternity.
Before we begin, I'm going to need you all to sign this.
A petition to bring back "Ally McBeal".
Well, yeah.
I mean, everything else is getting rebooted.
Get a young hottie in there, you know, like a Zendaya type.
Is it Zendaya or Zendaya?
Zendaya.
Or I don't I mean, who wouldn't watch that?
Am I right?
Anyone?
Fine.
Take it away, Matt.
Okay, the moment we've all been waiting for.
The test results that dictate the future of humanity.
Here we go.
In 30, 29 -  - Two, one.
VoilÃ .
I thought this would be fun.
Had a lot of time alone in there.
Bam!
Simone got 12% better than she was on Earth.
Bam!
Chidi got 26% better.
Bam!
John got 44% better.
Shoot.
Shouldn't have committed so hard to this "bam" thing.
Funeral!
Jason, at the risk of getting an answer that might thoroughly depress me, what made you choose this setting?
There's a Jacksonville tradition of having your funeral where you were born.
I got born in the deep end of a pool right after my mom did a cannonball.
Well, I knew the risks.
You never really talk about your mom.
Yeah, she died when I was pretty young.
I lost her to the big C. That's what we called the crocodile that lived by my house.
I'm just playing.
It was cancer.
Watch me do a handstand.
Jason Mendoza didn't have an easy life.
He once told me the closest he'd ever gotten to having a piÃ±ata on his birthday was when a seagull ate too many condoms on the beach and exploded.
But despite it all, he was the most optimistic person I'd ever met.
Jason was the very first person to ask me about my feelings.
I hadn't had any yet, but it made me want to go get some.
I could see something special inside him that no one else could see.
It was a multi-colored blob of positivity right behind his sternum.
That's my Jason, a big, colorful, rainbow blob stuffed inside a hot, life-size action figure.
Plus, I gotta say it was nice to have a true dirtbag buddy so I could talk about what really mattered in life.
Wrestling, semi-legal drugs, and Jason Statham.
Statham forever!
Indeed.
Statham forever.
Amen.
Amen.
Let's focus on the big picture here.
Free of Earth's complications and its unintended consequences, the other three improved a lot.
Chidi got 38% more confident.
Simone got 43% more flexible in her judgments of people, and John didn't call one single person the C-word.
But he did yell the C-word at himself as well as a pack of squirrels and a chair he tripped over.
Why are we even still discussing this?
Brent got worse.
If humans can't be good with their needs magically met, maybe they're just not that good.
He's right; the evidence needed to be overwhelming.
I can't just turn the whole afterlife upside down because three people got a little bit better.
But don't forget.
There's a lot of evidence that Eleanor, Jason and Tahani got better in the original experiment, so that's six people.
That's the number of friends in "Friends".
Are you gonna sit there and say that every single Friend belongs in hell?
I mean, maybe Ross and Rachel, and Monica and Joey, and definitely Chandler but Phoebe?
Face it, Michael.
You lost.
Everything you've done, this experiment, the original Neighborhood, sending your little cockroach buddies back to Earth, all of it was for nothing.
Bam.
You're glue.
Actually, Shawn, that's a very interesting point.
Exactly.
What?
Matt, call up the active files of four people still alive on Earth, Kamilah Al-Jamil, Donna Shellstrop, and her stepdaughter Patricia, and Steven Peleaz, AKA Pillboi.
They were not part of the experiment.
If he gets to bring in random good people into it, I should be able to bring in random bad people.
Call up Elizabeth Holmes.
No, Henry Kissinger.
No PewDiePie.
Your honor, the people I want to look at are not random.
They're four humans the cockroaches helped on Earth.
No magic.
Just just kindness.
And I bet their emotional support made those four people better.
And I'm wrong, I'll be the first to say we're glue.
I don't think any of you is using that right, but, fine, let's see it.
Look.
Right there.
After we intervened, Pillboi dedicated himself to caring for the elderly.
Kamilah started a scholarship in Tahani's name that sent 213 women to college.
Donna started doing homework with Patricia every night, and that little girl actually ended up teaching Donna multiplication.
Yikes.
Look, the point is people improve when they get external love and support.
How can we hold it against them when they don't?
Need I remind you that Brent got worse with every second of every moment of every day.
Until right at the end.
With 10 seconds left, he swung way up.
This is it, your honor.
This is the whole story.
No one is beyond rehabilitation.
Brent spent a year being an absolute diaper load of a human being, and the points total tells you that.
But what that number can't tell you is who he could've become tomorrow.
I'll have my ruling shortly.
Okay, Janet, where do you want to go for your funeral?
Dave and Buster's, probably?
You probably want to go to Dave and Buster's.
I think I heard her say Dave and Buster's, so let's just go there.
We can sort it out later.
It's nice that you want to honor me, but you've already given me so much.
Tahani taught me that you can make a family, even if you never really had one.
Jason taught me I have value beyond what I do for other people.
And Eleanor there was a moment on Earth when all hope was lost, and I watched you have hope anyway.
Just thinking about that makes me want to barf up a beautiful quasar.
Well said, Janet.
That means it's your turn, Eleanor.
All right.
Mine's easy.
We don't even have to move.
I stand here before you, in sweatpants for the first time ever, to celebrate Eleanor Shellstrop in a place where she spent much of her life, a bar in a house she was not invited to.
Eleanor was full of surprises.
I never knew if she was going to ruthlessly make fun of me, or totally objectify me in a way that was flattering, and also vaguely problematic.
- Well - But whether she was lifting me up or calling me out I never felt quite so seen as when she saw me.
Eleanor, I know you don't like it when people get all emotional about you, so I channeled all of my love for you into this song.
That's when the foam cannons go pshh!
Explode outward!
And then back to the song.
Okay, okay, we're good.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Okay, who's left?
We are here to celebrate the afterlife of Chidi Anagonye.
Eleanor, would you like to say a few words?
Chidi was a rootin', tootin', rackin' frackin' varmint.
Sorry, I don't know why I just went full Yosemite Sam, there.
Um yeah, I don't think I can do this.
I I can't just sum up all of my feelings about Chidi, so I'm gonna pass.
The Judge is about to make her ruling.
She wants us to be there to hear it.
Oh, we should probably change outfits.
Tahani's sweatpants say "skank army" on the butt.
They do?
Michael you came to me and said the points system was flawed, a system that has been in place since the dawn of time and has judged every soul that has ever walked the earth.
And I have come to the conclusion that you're right.
- I'm - You're right.
Humans are not fixed at one level of morality.
They can always get better, which means the points system does not accurately judge how good or bad they are.
You won.
Well that wasn't so hard now, what it?
-  - We did it!
We did it!
The universe owes you a debt of gratitude for bringing this to my attention.
Now, in terms of how we handle this moving forward, obviously, Earth is cancelled.
Buhh Earth is what, now?
All humans on Earth and in the afterlife will be extinguished, and we will start the entire human race over from scratch.
And you know what's so funny?
In a very roundabout way, I am actually rebooting "Ally McBeal" because I'm rebooting everything.
Anyway, congrats, Michael.
You won.
Whoa, whoa, your honor.
Let's just slow down here, and say everything again maybe, because I think some of us were thinking about skateboards and don't know what's going on.
Canceling Earth but doesn't seem a bit drastic?
It's just too much of a mess down there, you know?
I mean, the simplest solution is to erase everyone that ever lived and restart with a bunch of amoebas or whatever.
Then human life will evolve again, or maybe even something better.
Maybe this time they won't have baby teeth, you know?
That whole thing is so weird, like they fall out and then the bigger teeth just grow out of that same hole.
Gross.
Anyway, the important thing is Earth  How are you guys surprised?
I mean, what did you think was gonna happen if you won?
I don't know.
I thought we could just give, like, give three points for eating an apple instead of two.
Yes, why can't we just tweak the points a little?
Just, you know, a little boost, like Spanx, but for your soul.
- Yes.
- Guys, the problem isn't the points.
It's that Earth has become too complicated for the points to reflect the value of human behavior.
Remember?
The whole thing you discovered?
And now I have no choice but to fix it.
Where did I put that human wiper outer thingy?
Lip gloss, lip gloss, thing that ends all the wars, "Justified" season two.
Wow, you won.
And you still somehow failed.
Classic.
Wake Chidi up.
Now.
We need all the help we can get.
You really want me to wake him up, just to tell him that he and everyone else in the universe is going to cease to exist?
Not when you say it like that.
- Well, what -  The Good Place nerds.
Our only hope.
- Oh, wait, I, you know - Yo, yo, yo, angel types, if you are ever gonna do something, you gotta do it now.
Oh, you bet we're gonna do something.
This has gone too far.
I'm composing some very sternly worded letters.
Are we sure stern is the right tone?
We don't want to seem strident.
It upsets the norms.
You're absolutely right.
I apologize and resign, effective immediately.
-  - So bold.
I am so proud of you.
Here it is.
Great.
Michael, Shawn, Janet, see you in maybe a billion years.
It has been one crazy ride, you guys.
And I'm gonna miss everybody And I'm gonna miss everybody And I'm gonna miss everybody And I'm gonna miss every See you at the crossroads, crossroads See you at the crossroads, crossroads  I'm gonna miss you guys.
Okay.
Bye, y'all.
Janet, what the hell?
Give it back.
No, it's in my void, and you can't have it.
I don't say "no" a lot.
Did I pronounce that right?
Janet, you give me back my thingy, or I will go into your void and get it myself.
I'd like to see you try.
Oh, okay.
She's trying right now.
She's in my void.
It feels it feels weird.
Yikes.
Whoa.
Okay.
Real cute, honey.
Where is it?
What do you mean?
- It's not in my void?
- No.
It's in mine.
Ugh.
I feel like such a wiener hole saying this, but Michael wrote a manifesto, and I read it on the toilet.
I don't have to poop.
I choose to.
Anyway, I'm with them now.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, get over yourself, you dork.
The whole system is royally effed.
Humans suck but this isn't their fault.
You read what I wrote and it got through to you?
Yeah, but I also used the pages to wipe my butt, so don't pop a stiffy just yet.
Mm-kay?
- Ugh.
- I am so proud of you.
I don't care.
I think you do a little bit.
Whoo!
Sister hug.
Okay, get off me.
Ew, ew, ew, ew.
Hey, listen up.
I made an official ruling, and I am not going to see it undone by two Janets playing keep-away.
Oh, I should've explained.
It's not two of us.
It's all of us.
- Hi!
- What up, nerds?
- Hello.
- Eat my farts, losers.
I am here for a certain reason and no other reasons.
- What up, fart-knockers?
- Hi!
- Hello.
- What it is?
What it is?
What up, dorks?
Sent the manifesto around to all the other Janets.
We have a group text now.
I mostly send gifs of otters.
This is so annoying!
Okay, Janets.
You want to do this the hard way?
I am gonna search your voids one by one.
And then marbleize you one by one until I get my stupid Earth rebooter thingy back.
We're not gonna be able to hold her off forever.
We need a plan.
Okay, so what's the plan?
Plan, plan, plan.
Step one, get a plan.
Step two, do the plan.
Yeah, yeah.
This is working.
- Michael, focus.
- Right, sorry.
Uh all right, so if we can't change the points, then maybe we can change what we do with the points.
Yeah, we just need a brand new system for judging humans in the afterlife.
We can do this, right?
Yeah, but in order to crack it, I think you know what needs to happen.
There is literally only one person here who is smart enough and thoughtful enough to save humanity.
Fine.
I'll do it.
Not you, dummy.
Designing a better afterlife is the ultimate ethical question.
Chidi spent his entire existence pondering the biggest questions.
He is brilliant and empathetic.
All he cares about is how best to treat other people, and he is willing to sacrifice his own happiness to do it.
If we're gonna pull this off, we need Chidi back, and he needs his memories.
You want to take the most indecisive man ever born, stuff him full of over 800 different versions of himself, and then tell him he has, like, 45 minutes to save humanity?
You think that will go well?
I don't know how it's gonna go.
But he is our only chance, and it is now or literally never.
Wake him up.
Not in this Janet.
Next.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 -  - Not in this Janet.
Next.
What are you waiting for?
Do it.
It's not that easy.
He lived a whole life and then 802 afterlives, and a second life, then a second afterlife, and then a third "first" afterlife.
His psyche is like a giant bowl of M&M Peep chili.
I gotta make sure all the memories go in the right place in the right order.
Maybe I just start him at the beginning, a full factory reset.
Man.
Janet, can I please have a drink with a lot of alcohol in it?
Here, I saved this from my funeral.
It's called a Duval Ditchwater.
It's Midori, Coffee-Mate, and ditch water.
- I'll get you a margarita.
- Yeah, that sounds better.
It's not.
Seriously, try this.
- Okay, here we go - Oh   Oh!
- He has your eyes.
- And your smile.
- Now he just needs a name.
- Big decision.
- How about Chidi?
- Oh, I like that.
Do you like it, Chidi?
Or would you like a different name?
-  -  - Looks like he has a tummy ache.
- Uh-oh.
Chidi.
You're not listening to me.
Everything always has to be your way.
And what is the one right way?
I mean, how many times have I told you this?
I thought this was what you wanted.
No, it's obviously what you want.
You're just angry that your book was rejected.
Oh, how dare you bring that up again?
You're always at the university!
How about use show some interest in someone who didn't die 200 years ago?
I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
We need to go back to Nigeria.
No, we are not going.
My family is here.
And we did this for your career.
Good morning, Chidi.
Would you like some breakfast?
I have a presentation.
- - Here's a syllabus.
Take one and pass them on.
My lecture will take approximately 55 minutes.
Let's begin, shall we?
In conclusion, there is one clear answer, and it's that the two of you should stay married.
Questions?
That was clear and persuasive, - and you have made a strong case.
- Yes.
Well argued.
Better than some of my grad students.
You should get ready for school.
I'll take you.
We'll both take you.
It worked?
Perfectly.
They're happy again, Uzo.
They're even talking about getting me a puppy.
But more importantly, I proved once and for all that you can always find the answer.
- The answer to what?
- To anything.
Every problem has an answer.
If you just read enough books and think hard enough, you can figure out the answer to any question.
I know you're really smart, but that sounds wrong.
Children, please take your seats.
Here's a perfect example.
Where to sit?
What's the answer?
Obviously, we want to be back by the pencil sharpener but in the front I can see - the blackboard better.
-  Or by the door to get a nice breeze.
- Chidi.
- Just hang on.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
I still say Professor Lindeman was a fool to abandon Chidi.
He has a brilliant mind.
One day he will use it to solve the world's biggest problems.
Is this enough cheese?
I hope this is enough cheese.
There's sheep, goat, and cow's milk.
- I can run and get more.
- Oh, no.
This is plenty of cheese.
I have to ask, has Chidi always been so thoughtful?
Ever since he was a child.
I'm sure you've heard about his first great lecture.
Oh, no.
Not that old story again.
It's so embarrassing.
Oh, go ahead.
A long time ago, Emeka and I were going through a rough patch, and our little Chidi, at eight years old, comes in with a one-hour lecture.
All about why we should stay married, and all these years later, here we still are.
- It's the reason I got into philosophy.
- Mm-hmm.
The biggest questions and the biggest answers, you just gotta find them.
I mean, I love philosophy, too, but I'd argue that, say, theoretical physics presents bigger questions than philosophy.
Oh  Do you really think that?
Should I switch to physics?
So obviously my parents loved you.
I'm so glad.
They're great.
We have to break up.
Uh,  wait.
What?
Why?
I've been feeling this way for a while now.
It's just why are we together?
Because it it makes sense.
I mean, you like Kant.
I like Kant.
We're not a book group.
I mean, but we're not not a book group.
Okay, if there's a problem with our relationship, there is an answer that will solve it.
- So, let's hit the library.
- You wanna use philosophy?
How about David Hume?
"Reason is and ought only to be a slave to the passions".
You know, emotions, desires, feelings.
- Do you have any of those?
- Of course I have feelings.
I I have strong feelings for for you and and what we have, and right now, I will show you How Kant refuted most of Hume's central theses.
- Oh, my God.
- He   So, what do you think?
I think it's 3,600 pages.
I have a job, Chidi.
I have a family.
Until I had to read this, I had a will to live.
This work is an insane, tangled web of inscrutability.
In the fun, "grad students will analyze this for centuries" way?
No, in the Unabomber way.
Okay, well, um, I'll write my way out of the maze.
I'll re-outline the middle chapters, - do more research - No, Chidi.
You can't answer every question every philosopher has ever asked, so what in these pages do you care about?
- All of it.
Equally.
- Shut up.
- But - Shut up, shut up.
- Should I - Shut up, shut up.
The greatest works of modern philosophy are emotional.
They make an argument about how the world is and ought to be.
There is a great mind at work in here, but where is the heart?
Where are the guts?
I understand.
I do.
So I'm going to go home and compose a short paper for you, arguing that I should continue working on this longer paper.
Shut up!
Wow, tough week.
Sorry, pal.
I mean, honestly, I don't know what hurts more; my thesis meeting or Allesandra.
She was brilliant and and funny.
I thought that maybe she was the answer.
Some things in life don't have an answer.
Isn't that what Allesandra was saying?
Isn't that what your advisor said, too?
Isn't that what everyone who knows you has said to you at every waking moment of your life?
Okay, I can figure this out.
I just need to find the answer for how to impress Allesandra, a separate answer for how to impress my advisor, or ideally, one answer for how to impress them both.
Oh, you know what this calls for.
- Don't say it.
- A Venn diagram.
No Venn diagram.
If you won't listen to other people, do you at least hear what you're saying?
I swear, sometimes it is literally impossible to be your friend.
You're incapable of making a single decision.
Look, what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes - to find the perfect -     Chidi, come on in.
Unless you'd be more comfortable out here.
Oh, well, I feel like you want me to I tell you what.
I'll decide for you.
- Come on in.
- Great.
Watch this.
Your fridge chooses your breakfast for you.
Oatmeal and almond milk.
Extra filmy.
You don't even have to decide.
It just knows what you want, and for all your other requests, Janet?
- Hi there.
-   Janet knows the answers to all the questions in the universe.
Ask her anything.
I mean, which answer do I want?
I mean, something profound, obviously.
It shouldn't be trivial or salacious.
Or maybe I should start small and maybe ramp up.
Or I can't  - What's the biggest fish?
- The whale shark.
Cool.
I'm sorry.
I'll have better questions later.
You don't need to apologize, Chidi.
All questions are equally important to me.
Oh, well then you and I are gonna get along great.
-  -  I need to go welcome some more residents.
Are there any other questions I can answer for you before I go?
Well, yes.
Is is there a relationship equivalent to the oatmeal?
Uh, is there, like, a sort of Soul mate?
Yes.
Every person in the Good Place has one perfect match.
In an hour, come on by the little house that looks like a face and get the answer to your ultimate question.
Her name's Eleanor.
Oh, man.
Remember this?
Yeah, yeah.
- It was eight minutes ago.
- Mm-hmm.
So you just proposed to Janet, and you said yes.
- And now you're married.
- Mm-hmm.
You know, I thought saying that out loud would make it less insane, but it did not.
Thanks, homie.
If you'd like to get us a present, we're registered at me.
-  - Jason, I think I need your help.
- Can I ask you something?
- Cool.
No one's ever asked me for advice before, and you're a high school principal.
College professor.
Who who told you how to do this?
Like, how can you just make a decision this big?
Chidi, here's the thing with stuff.
You can look at a problem from every angle and drive yourself crazy, but sometimes, you just gotta huck a Molotov cocktail at a drone and see what happens.
Is what happens that the drone blows up?
Usually.
I mean, where I'm from, most things blow up eventually, so I learned that when something dope comes along, you gotta lock it down.
If you're always frozen in fear and taking too long to think about what to do, you'll miss your opportunity and maybe get sucked into the propeller of a swamp boat.
I just I don't think I'll ever be the kind of person who just acts.
I mean, I can't just open a door and walk through without knowing what's on the other side.
Even with eternity to try, - I just don't think that can happen.
-  Well, I never thought I'd ever be able to get married.
I thought I was too old.
I'm infinity, but strange things happen in the afterlife.
We figured it out once.
We can do it again, because you know what, Michael?
You're basic This is your soul mate, Salamasina.
Meet your soul mate, Guan-yin.
Tahani.
Karen.
Esmerelda, you don't bring knives to a friendly game night.
I mean, who does that?
The prepared.
Chidi, Esmerelda.
It's your turn.
Blood.
Seas of blood.
Enemies.
Uh, 1,000 years of darkness.
- Uh, nightmares.
- Blood.
Ennui.
Lamenting the unanswerable passage of time.
Fire and blood!
-  -  You fool!
It was birthday parties.
Birthday parties?
These trivialities demean me.
I must away and tend to my ravens.
Well  you never know what'll happen at game night.
Let's continue.
I think I can find you another partner.
Tahani.
Thank you so much.
That ended up being one of the best nights I've had since we got here.
You and Eleanor made a good pair.
She really tore through that round of charades.
Well, I'm pretty sure she was reading the cards off the reflection in my glasses, but yeah, that was amazing.
Um, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.
- Tonight could have been a real disaster.
How do you have the confidence to just swoop in and so elegantly take charge of a whole group of strangers?
Honestly, the confidence comes from failure.
I've thrown my fair share of disastrous gatherings.
Remind me to tell you someday about TimothÃ©e Chalamet's bar mitzvah.
But you live through the failure and you learn from it.
Yeah, I just I can't operate that way.
I can't make a decision unless I'm sure I'm right.
Hey, Chidi, you're a philosophy professor, right?
Any chance you'd wanna grab a drink and talk about ethics?
It's a subject I've recently needed - to learn about immediately.
- Sounds great.
- Uh, let me get my coat.
- Awesome.
By the way, I wasn't cheating before.
Or eavesdropping just now.
Whoo!
When we started three months ago, I never thought I'd get so into philosophy - that we'd study past midnight.
-  Esmerelda must be wondering where her soul mate is.
Ah, no, she's off in her aviary.
Sometimes I think her ravens are her real soul mate.
-  - I'm not kidding.
Actually, you should see her with them.
It's intense, and if I'm being honest, sexually charged.
Anyways, um, this has been fun as alway  Uh, what was why did you Who was it?
Okay.
I'll take those one at a time, I guess.
Um, it was a kiss, I did it because I wanted to, and as far as who it was, it was me, weirdo.
Eleanor, I I have a soul mate.
Yeah, and you're not into her at all.
I mean, come on.
There is no way you're supposed to spend eternity with a woman who sleeps in a giant nest.
Look, I I know she and I are in a rough patch, but we just have to find the answer for how to get out of it, like my parents.
You remember that story I told you about my parents.
Yeah, I don't think that story is as cute as you think it is, man.
I mean, I'm sure you were cute, you know?
Big melon head and a little neck tie.
But that moment, woof.
That's too much to put on an eight-year-old.
I kinda wish cute little Chidi just got to be a kid rather than a miniature professor trying to solve all the world's problems.
Well, but living that way led me to philosophy, and, sure, I was written up in a medical journal as the youngest person ever with a stress-induced ulcer, but I got into the Good Place, so if you don't mind, I'm gonna take a second to think about what I owe my universe-approved soul mate and and not just, uh, make out with you.
Okay, man.
Kiss rescinded.
We'll just study like two platonic nerds until Michael discovers me or until Esmerelda turns me into a toad with her magic amulet because she can see that we're obviously into each other.
Oh, sorry you got an actual human being instead of your true soul mate, a library cart full of damp saltines.
You are unbelievable!
I don't know what I did to deserve you.
Believe it, baby.
I'm all yours.
At least until something better comes along.
For me.
You've pretty much topped out.
- You okay?
- No.
I have to give Michael a new draft of my thesis and I'm a mess.
- Will you help me?
- Woof!
You want my help with philosophy?
You must be in rough shape.
I mean, yes, of course.
I'm here for you.
What do you need?
I need someone to help guide me, morally speaking, and I think I need it to be you.
There's a real possibility that I'm in love with you again, here on this plane of existence, uh, today, now.
We found each other before, hundreds of times.
We can do it again.
Bye, Chidi.
You're sure you want to do this?
I finally make up my mind about one damn thing, and you try to talk me out of it?
I'm sure.
Can I ask you a question?
Soul mates aren't real, are they?
Chidi, in all honesty, I don't know, but I don't think so.
I knew what you expected to find when you got here; answers.
Also, if I recall from your file, a magic blackboard?
One that anticipates your lesson flow.
That's the dream.
But mostly you wanted answers.
The soul mate one, in particular.
So, I used it to torture you, which, again, sorry.
If soul mates do exist, they're not found.
They're made.
People meet, they get a good feeling, and then they get to work building a relationship, like your parents.
They didn't magically stay together because you proved they should.
It wasn't my logic or my representation.
It was the feeling they got watching me this scared little kid telling them that he needed them.
It was also what you made them remember.
You know, they loved each other.
Sometimes people forget.
You reminded them of what they already had.
It convinced them to go to counseling.
I never knew they went to counseling.
Yeah, kids are idiots.
If they knew half the stuff their folks were up to, they'd lose their minds.
Turns out life isn't a puzzle that can just be solved one time and and it's done.
You wake up every day and you solve it again.
Terribly inefficient.
Wow, what a time to learn.
Can you give me a second?
- Janet?
- Hi there.
Hi.
Uh, can I have, uh, a pen and some paper?
I don't know if I'll see you again, or what I'll remember if I do, but if we do cross paths again  Sometime, somewhere Can you give this back to me?
Of course.
I'm ready.
Hi there, Chidi.
Welcome back.
Is he all right?
Did you break him?
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?
Man, I'm doing great.
Hey, so, for the past 300 years, have I been super annoying?
- Oh, no - No, no.
- I wouldn't say extremely.
- Not super.
- No, no.
- Yes.
Well, thank you, all of you, for everything you've done for me.
You are wonderful people.
Yeah, man, that's great, but, um, listen, we have, like, one hour to create an entirely new afterlife, and, uh, also save all of humanity and we were wondering if you could do your Chidi thing and, um, find us the answer?
Oh, well, Eleanor, this kind of thing doesn't have just one answer.
There might be 800.
There could be zero.
Who knows, you know?
The journey is the destination, right?
Let's get to work.
Can you give me one second?
- Uh - One second.
Hey, uh, Janet, can I have my note, please?
If you know that you wrote a note then you know what it says.
I do, uh, but I'd still like to see it again, please.
I think it might be some of the best writing I've ever done.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Ugh.
All Janet voids are nothing, but Neutral Janet voids are, like, the most nothing.
Judge, please, please don't cancel Earth.
Why not?
The system's broken.
You guys proved it.
I just want to reboot the whole thing, and go back to my chambers.
I am on season three of "Justified," and can I just tell you, it is so good.
I, like, binged all of season two in a day.
Think of all the amazing human achievement you'd be eliminating.
The works of William Shakespeare.
The Pyramids.
- Timothy Olyphant.
-  Ooh, that one stings.
There's, like, 50 gallons of man in a 10-gallon hat.
I'm, like, oh!
Look, I'm the freaking Judge, and I made a freaking ruling, and it's gonna freaking happen, soon as I find the freaking clicker thing.
All right, what do I search for?
Humanity eraser button garage door opener thingy judge.
-  -   Well, it wasn't in you.
Any last words?
These are my last words.
End of words.
Yes.
Really boring.
Bye!
All right, who's next?
Your dad's pimply butt, you fat dink.
That is so interesting because last time I checked, I didn't have a dad.
That's why I'm attracted to all the father figures on the TV shows I watch.
Mm-kmm?
We can't play keep-away forever.
Keep trying.
Get her to see the light.
I already showed her the light.
She wasn't impressed.
To be fair, she was there when it was invented.
- Hey, bud?
- Hi.
I know you're trying to think of ways to save every soul who's ever lived and whatnot, but, um, we may only have a half hour left to exist, so I just wanted to check in with you vis-Ã -vis us.
Oh, okay, yeah.
Cool.
I love you.
Whoa.
Really?
Yeah.
I love you.
So, uh, do you love me?
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, then, cool!
You and I are on our way to Coolsville.
You seem oddly sure, which is unlike you, but it's kind of doing it for me.
Should we get out of here?
No, but I like the confidence.
Well, when you have a thousand different versions of yourself over multiple timelines fused and instantly placed into your consciousness, it gives you a real sense of clarity.
You saw the time knife, huh?
Yep.
Saw the time knife.
It was neat.
Okay, let's save humanity, shall we?
Can one of you Janets get me a chalkboard and a copy of Judith Shklar's "Ordinary Vices"?
Oh, and maybe some warm pretzels.
If we going out, I'm going out with a belly full of warm pretzels.
Yummy, yum, yum.
Yummy!
Okay, before we try to completely redesign the entire afterlife, has anyone just thought of a good reason the Judge shouldn't cancel Earth?
Because it would be a bummer.
Yeah, we might need more than that.
Are you at least gonna write it down?
Did you actually write it down, or did you just do a scribble-scrabble?
Okay, we need to think bigger.
We need to come up with an entirely new afterlife system that both the Good and Bad Places agree on, which seems impossible.
Nonsense.
Compromise is always possible.
I was once in Portofino with Bruno Mars, LeBron James, and Dr. Ruth Westheimer We don't have time for this right now, babe.
Fine.
Long story short, LeBron performed a successful tracheotomy, the son won multiple Grammys, and everyone was really happy.
Well, now I want to hear the story.
No, you're right.
Let's focus.
So, in this essay, "Putting Cruelty First," Judith Shklar contends that we should consider cruelty as society's primary flaw.
I'm sorry, are you wearing roller skates?
Yeah.
I got them from Disco Janet.
Thanks, Disco Janet.
- Solid.
- Anyway, here's her point.
Imagine someone sells a joint and then gets locked away in a dangerous prison for years.
The crime isn't cruel, but the punishment is.
- That's a problem.
- Tell me about it.
I once went to jail for a week just because I stole a hot dog.
Well, a hot-dog-shaped car.
I stole the Wienermobile.
This is the problem with the current system.
Live anything less than the most exemplary life, and you are brutally tortured forever with no recourse.
The cruelty of the punishment does not match the cruelty of the life that one has lived.
Now, watch this spin.
So we need to come up with a system that will result in the least amount of cruelty and suffering to those who don't deserve it.
This is a problem of justice.
Hearing you talk about philosophical concepts of justice is sexy.
- You want to get out of here?
- Yes.
No.
Keep going.
Ugh.
Bad Janet voids are the worst.
Music off!
-  - Oh, right, I forgot.
- Make it louder!
-  What if you start humanity over from scratch, and humans evolve over millions of years and they end up worse?
What if they invent rap-rock sooner, and it becomes the only kind of music?
Do you really want to oversee an entire world of Limp Bizkits run by Emperor Kid Rock?
Not my problem.
All right, here we go.
Software update?
No, cancel.
Why is it doing it now?
This computer sucks.
-  - Okay, mama.
See you in the next life.
Before you marbleize me, can I just make one final statement to summarize how I really feel?
I think I know where this is going.
Okay, Disco Janet, you're up.
Out of sight.
What are you guys still doing here?
Just go back to Mindy's and have a lukewarm beer, and wait for me to end you there.
Except for you, cookie-puss.
I'll always make room for you.
Wait a second.
That's it.
I agree.
Chidi should hook up with the Judge to get us out of trouble.
I'd done that a bunch of times.
It's called a Jacksonville plea bargain.
No, Mindy's house.
Eleanor always thought there should be a Medium Place for people who led medium lives.
That's the answer.
We make the Medium Place a third option.
Of course.
Maybe if you score negative points on Earth sorry, you blew it.
Enjoy having your penis flattened.
Over a million or whatever, party time.
And everyone else in between gets their own personal Cincinnati.
It's definitely less cruel than the current system, but it's not great.
Well, it might be the best we can do given the circumstances.
Let's try to sell it to the brass.
Hello, all.
Thought as the universe is ending, you'd be less cheery.
Hard not to be cheery when you're eating this delicious frozen yogurt.
I got a small amount of each flavor.
It's the only way to ensure a mouthful of compromise.
- You are so right.
- Well said.
Shut up!
Shut up.
Hi.
Shut up.
- I'm confident now.
- Oh, sorry.
We're just short on time.
Look, we have a new idea about how humans could be placed in the afterlife We love it.
We're in.
You don't even want to hear it?
Nope.
If you guys came up with it, it must be good.
- Oh, yeah.
- Guys, they said yes.
Let's take the win.
Now all we have to do is convince Shawn.
I'll take the lead.
If I can convince Dr. Ruth not to sue Bruno Mars over songwriting credit on "Uptown Funk," I can handle this.
Okay, you gotta tell me that story on the way.
So anyone who doesn't meet the threshold for the new Medium Place Neighborhood is yours for the taking.
The Bad Place still has plenty of people to torture.
I have to admit this does make sense.
And I like that your side is settling for a crappy deal while my side stays mostly the same.
What the hell.
I'm in.
- Really?
- No.
You actually believed me?
Dude, in 20 minutes, all of humanity is going to be erased forever.
And?
The Bad Place will get emptied out, too.
You will have no one to torture for billions of years.
Everyone loses.
Oh, I know.
But here's the thing.
I don't care if everyone loses as long as you lose.
- Shawn, listen to reason.
- Why should I?
None of this would've happened if you hadn't mucked around with your Neighborhood and your new ideas.
New ideas are gross.
They sicken me.
Shawn, you used to be cool, but you've changed, man.
I'm gonna go write an evil speech for when this is all over.
It is gonna be so long.
You can ring my bell Ring my bell Whoa!
You can ring my bell Wait a second.
What was I doing?
I'll tell you what you were doing.
You were tearing up the dance floor.
No, I was looking for the stupid clicker thingy.
God, those infectious disco grooves.
So wait, wait, wait, wait.
We have this amazing new idea, and Shawn is almost on board.
Maybe if you talk to him, you could nudge him towards an agreement.
I don't take sides.
I am the Judge.
My only concerns are fairness and impartiality.
Gonna erase the Earth Erase the Earth That song is really my yam.
Humanity eraser thingy.
Welp.
Later, skater.
Keep on truckin'.
Next!
Even for a demon, Shawn is being a real knob.
Guys, I know what we have to offer him to get him to change his mind.
- What?
- Something he wants.
Once we figure that out, we're golden.
It's pointless.
He's so focused on beating us that he's willing to burn everything down.
There's nothing we can offer him.
Actually, there is something he wants.
Cruelty.
So let's give it to him.
Oh, hey, guys.
Just smashing some stuff.
- What's up?
- Listen, demon, we know how much you want us to lose, so we volunteer to lose permanently if you agree to let the Judge establish a real Medium Place.
You can torture the four of us forever.
- Really?
- Yeah.
This is a classic trolley problem.
One of your boys sets off a stink bomb on the trolley, causing a commotion so the rest of the group can pickpocket people as they run off the train.
That's very wrong, but in a roundabout way, you kind of got where you needed to be.
I'll even give you a head start on my torture.
I cannot pull off the "mod" look.
You can take me, too.
I couldn't live with myself knowing you four were down there without me.
Wow.
This is a toughy.
On one hand, I would love to get some spiders in those buttholes.
On the other hand, there would be billions of buttholes going completely un-spidered.
How about this?
Everyone who dies go to the Bad Place and I get to torture all of you.
Sounds good to us.
No, dummies.
That's already how it works, except we're also tortured.
Look, I put forward a proposal.
Are you not even going to negotiate?
He's got a point.
The fair thing for us to do is just keep on giving up more and more stuff we want unilaterally until this demon's finally happy.
Fork this.
If we're gonna lose, let's lose on our own terms.
Let's come up with a completely new idea that actually makes the universe better.
Amen.
At least then, we can hold our heads high.
Okay, we need to come up with our ideal plan in about 10 minutes.
Guys, it's all come to this.
Everything we've been through multiple lives you led on Earth, all the lives you led here, all the ethics training and lessons and journeys to the farthest corners of the afterlife all happened so that we could be here together as the very best versions of ourselves, to solve the ultimate problem in the nick of time.
Cool speech.
Now it's nine minutes.
Chidi, can you do this?
Actually, what you just said, the very best versions of ourselves, gave me an idea.
Huh.
Turns out it was a cool speech.
Not in you, either.
I just have one thing left to say.
-  - No.
Not falling for that again.
Man, she is committed.
That just leaves you.
Your Honor, we have an idea we'd like to present Not interested, stretch.
How can we convince her of our plan if she won't even listen?
Well, if she's not gonna stay out here, you gotta go in there.
But that didn't really work great last time.
Yeah, it wasn't an amazing, but she's gonna marbleize me in, like, two minutes, so we might as well try.
Are we all gonna be - you again?
- I don't think so.
Going through that once changed me and all of you.
But if the Judge wasn't gonna listen to us out here, what makes you think she'll listen to us in there?
I know one thing that might keep her attention.
Idiots.
Aw, nuts.
How did I fall for that?
- Please, have a seat, Your Honor.
- I already told you.
I'm not interested.
Give me one reason why I should hear you out?
Okay.
Here he is.
Ma'am.
You made me an Olyphant?
I think you should hear them out, Judge.
Only seems fair.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Well played, Janet.
I don't mind taking in the view when the scenery is so pretty.
Oh, I should call Shawn for this.
Aw, man.
I had just gotten all the puppies to climb into the cannon.
All right.
Floor is yours.
So the problem with the afterlife is not only that it's cruel, but that it's final.
You get one shot on Earth, and regardless of the context of your life, you're placed somewhere, usually the Bad Place, forever with no chance for redemption.
My Neighborhood was built to torture humans, but it made them better.
We want to create a system that works that way intentionally, a system designed to give people a fighting chance.
Huh.
Interesting.
Why don't you walk us through it?
Yeah, we're gonna, man.
Just chill.
Your time on Earth won't be a test that you either pass or fail, but instead a class you take, and the test will come in the afterlife.
The first part stays the same.
You live your life, screw up a bunch of stuff.
Like, a lot of stuff.
Like, to the point where people are, like this is mess up, even for Florida.
But you can't hear them because you fell into the swamp trying to spray paint a Taco Bell logo on a snapping turtle.
We rest our case, Your Honor.
- No, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, we don't.
We barely started.
So when you die, you still have a points total, but in the new system, that number will serve as a sort of baseline to determine how hard or how easy your test is.
Sorry.
I'm just trying to play catch-up here.
Who's designing these tests, exactly?
A Good Place architect and a Bad Place architect will work together to design a scenario to make you confront your moral shortcomings, like Eleanor's selfishness, Jason's impulsivity, Chidi's indecisiveness, and my complete inability to carry off a mod look.
- That's not - I know I have other faults, but that is a big one.
The test could be anything.
Maybe you show up and you're told you're in the Good Place, but you know that it's a mistake.
Maybe the test looks just like your regular life, or a twisted version of your life.
You're presented with these challenges.
Do well or badly, at the end, you're given a sort of evaluation.
Yeah, and the architects explain what you did badly, what you did well, and then you get rebooted and do it again and again and again until you ace it.
Oh, hang on.
It seems to me if y'all get rebooted, your memories will be wiped out.
How you ever gonna learn anything if you're always having to start from scratch?
- Mm-hmm.
- Good point, Timothy Olyphant.
- Tim's fine.
- Okay, great.
In the new system, you will retain a vague memory of what you learned in the evaluation sessions.
That information, what you did well or badly, stays with you like like a little voice in your head, helping you become a better version of yourself.
Okay, that helps.
Thank you.
So our guess is that with enough chances, people will eventually make enough good choices to qualify for the Good Place, and maybe some never will, but that's okay because everyone gets a fair shot.
Hold the phone.
What are my demons doing this whole time?
I have millions of lava monsters down there who will be out of a job.
I ask you, into whose throats are they supposed to pour lava?
Well, bad news is no more throat lava or penis flattenings.
Then what are we doing to their penises?
Well, largely, ignoring them.
You guys are hearing this.
I'm not crazy, right?
No, I mean, it's a fair question.
Whose side are you on, man?
I don't have a dog in this fight, little lady.
I'm just looking for clarity.
Shawn, you'll all still have jobs.
Bad place architects help design the test.
Rank and file demons, they'll play-role just like they did in my original Neighborhood.
And remember how much fun you had playing the Judge?
I don't know, guys.
You think this will work?
It sort of already has.
Chidi just had 800 versions of himself stuffed into his soul at the same time.
I mean, he's a new man.
He's way cooler now.
I like the old version, too, but not as much.
It's not just Chidi, Your Honor.
When I started in Michael's first Neighborhood, I was nothing more than a PalmPilot in a cool vest.
But look at me now.
I can hold four humans in my void, and conjure Timothy Olyphant in the blink of an eye.
Getting rebooted over and over made me a better not-a-person than I've ever been.
Humans should get the same opportunity.
Well?
Mm pass.
Well, guys, I really thought you had it.
It has been a genuine pleasure, sweetie.
Oh.
Gonna erase the Earth Erase the Earth I hid the clicker as far away as possible, but we are seconds away.
I'm so sorry, guys.
Where did Shawn go?
Oh, don't bother.
He's just toying with us.
I know.
That's what gives me hope.
Had to do it one last time before all this goes away for good.
So what are you offering me now?
Nothing.
It's over.
That was our last idea.
Good.
Soon, all your precious humans will be gone.
Yeah.
It's too bad.
Well, congrats, bud.
You won.
See you in a billion years.
When the humans evolve again, I'll be right back at your throat, you traitor.
I mean, yeah, I know.
That's why I said, "See you in a billion years".
Wait.
I'm gonna do the evil speech now.
If you want.
Since the dawn of time, good and evil have waged a furious battle, stemming from this feels stupid if you're not gonna fight back.
How do you not have another plan?
You've always had another plan.
What's wrong, Shawn?
Okay, fine.
Gonna make me admit it.
Fighting you is the most fun I've ever had.
I mean, you know.
You corkscrew your first eyeball, and you're like, man, I can't believe they're paying me to do this.
By the trillionth, it's like I should've just been a teacher.
And then you go and get the warm fuzzies about your little humans, and something something changed.
I was having fun again.
I'm not sure I'm ready for that to end.
I know, buddy.
It's hard when things end.
But one way or the other, this is over.
The only question is what's next?
I heard your speech at Demon-Con.
You know this system stinks.
You wouldn't have let me try the original experiment if things were working.
Let's try a new way together.
Okay, finally.
For the last time, I, the Judge of the afterlife - Hang on, Your Honor.
-  Are you kidding me?
Can't a gal just end all of humanity one time without everyone getting all up on her junk?
What is it, man?
Shawn has agreed to our proposal.
Wait, seriously?
In principle, yes.
Still some kinks to work in - Out.
- Out.
Sorry.
Old habits.
But I think we can find a way to make it work.
- Guys, watch this.
-  Sorry.
Jeez.
Okay, well, assuming we are redesigning the entire afterlife according to this plan what do we do first?
Oh, don't look at me.
I'm I'm just the idea guy.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Anything?
Nope.
Nobody know squat.
What the here is going on?
We haven't had any new humans to torture in, like, a week.
- I miss it.
- I know.
I got so desperate this morning, I tried flattening an eggplant.
It's just not the same.
Hey, skin tags.
Special meeting.
- About what?
- I don't know.
Probably your dad's stinky sack.
I hope it's not more sexual harassment training.
We just did that, and I'm already so good at it.
Whoa.
All right.
We got them.
Okay, here we go!
Yeah, uh, that's not exactly what's happening here.
The Bad Place is going to be changing, and I'm well, I'm kind of your boss now.
He's joking, right?
I'm afraid he's not.
Things are changing.
Michael and I are actually going to be  Working together.
Ugh.
Oh, I hated that.
I hated saying it.
Hated how it felt.
Hated all of it.
Ugh.
You all have been hand-selected to be the very first Bad Place Architects who will learn the new system.
Why do we need a new system?
Torture works.
It's the way it's always been done.
With all due respect, "it's the way it's always been done" is an excuse that's been used for hundreds of years to justify racism, misogyny Exactly.
See?
This chick gets it.
So these computers have access to every file for every human currently in the Bad Place, and the three of us have a very important job.
To find out which former U.S. presidents were secretly gay.
- No.
- Okay, fine, bi.
Sure, but also, while Michael is trying to get the Architects trained, we're supposed to find the first 1,000 humans to take the test people who will just sail right through it so we can build confidence in the system.
So what are the criteria?
Should it be people with the highest point totals or overcame the greatest hardship?
I think we just start with the gimmes the very best people who ever lived.
So Evel Knievel, Kool-Aid Man, Mini-Me, DJ Jazzy Jeff, a genie so we can wish for infinity people.
- Jason - Sure, throw me in there, too.
Also, Fat Bastard, the World's Most Interesting Man, Pikachu, Karate Kid, Wendy from Wendy's, Grumpy Cat, and the GPS lady that tells you where to drive.
Feels like a good stopping point.
Let's call it a day, come back fresh tomorrow.
- Great job, everyone.
- What Uh Okay, Janet's passing out the file on Tahani Al-Jamil, who volunteered to be today's test subject.
So take a look, and then we'll get going.
They don't seem very enthused.
This may be a tougher challenge than I thought, like when I tried to teach Taylor Swift how to dance.
The longest four years of my life.
We're uprooting the entire Bad Place system, and these Architects are set in their ways.
It's gonna take a lot of work, but the work is the fun part, guys.
So no matter who long it takes, see it through and usher in a better, brighter future.
Screw this.
I'm not working for a traitor.
Phil out.
That's my name, Phil.
Oh, Phil, hey.
Come on, buddy.
I personally chose you based on your innovative work in the Performative Wokeness department.
Wow.
Way to mansplain my own department to me.
And I'm triggered.
Oh, man.
What a legend.
Ooh, who you reading about?
Me.
I ruled on Earth.
I siphoned so much gas, Eleanor.
Even if the car was moving or on fire or a boat, I still always got that gas.
Oh, man.
I never thought about the fact that we could look up our own files.
Yeah, I printed out all of ours.
I love you, okay?
Oh.
The words are nice, but the tone is scary.
We're in love, and everything's great, and if we want to keep it that way, you have to promise to never, ever, ever read my file.
Okay.
If you don't want me to, then of course I won't, but nothing in there could ever change how I feel about you.
Eh, you say that now, but you don't know what I did on Halloween 2013.
What did you do on Halloween 2013?
Oh, I don't remember, but it must've been bad, because the next morning, I woke up in a large Rubbermaid container in some family's basement, and I had barfed all over their old photo albums.
Yeah, see, that's the look we're trying to avoid here, bud.
I don't need to read your file.
I know you, and I love you.
And I can't wait to spend eternity with you.
I mean, obviously, we have a lot of work to do here, and then we both have to pass the test, but eventually we're gonna be together forever You have to read my file right now!
What?
I'm confused.
Is this a game?
Is it a sex game somehow?
I can't risk it.
What if we spend half of eternity together and then you find out something that does change the way you feel about me and then you resent me for wasting half your eternity?
No, it's better we just rip the Band-Aid off, and you read about all the bad stuff now when we're hot and heavy.
Okay.
I'll read your file.
Can I finish reading about Oskar Schindler first?
That's who I got to follow?
The list guy?
You and I are so screwed, dude.
After as many attempts as it takes, if your human passes the test and proves that they deserve to go to the Good Place, you'll hear this sound.
-  - Good Place, here I come.
This new system is great.
Who do we have to thank for effortlessly implementing it?
Whoever it is, I think we can all agree it was a home run.
It was me.
Okay, bye, everyone.
Sweet Hitler's hairpiece.
Is this movie finally over?
It's basically over.
Just one little It's simply the test Better than other tests - I think we should stop.
- Okay, so, thoughts?
Yeah.
This all sounds so lame.
No, it's the current system that's lame.
It's so basic.
You get a human's file, and let's be honest, you never even read it.
You just skip to the fears and phobias section and use that to torture them.
Fear of snakes, throw them in a snake pit.
Worried something's gonna happen to your normal cylindrical penis, flatten it.
This new way allows you to test their specific psychological flaws and weaknesses.
And trust us, they have plenty.
- Hey.
- Sorry.
I'm in selling mode.
Guys, this is your chance to be part of a bold new future.
You telling me there's not one single demon who wants to design the very first sample test of this new system?
Oh, there is.
And she's a stone-cold fox.
Vicky, what are you doing here?
Relax.
I heard about the new system, I love it, and I want to be a part of it.
Forgive me if I'm a little skeptical, given that you did once try to sabotage my entire Neighborhood.
Look, after you blew me into goo, I had a lot of time to think, while my goo was re-forming.
If things are gonna change, then I have to change along with them.
And, sure, change can be scary, but I'm an artist which means it's my job to be scared.
All right, fine.
Take a seat.
Janet'll give you Tahani's file.
Oh, no, I don't I don't need her file.
I know Tahani very well self-obsessed, family issues, way too into being tall.
Typical Vicky throwing shade.
But it doesn't matter 'cause I'm casting it.
Because I'm closer to the Sun.
I'm tall.
Oh, no.
I knew it.
You hate me now.
What did it?
The time I was subpoenaed by the Make-A-Wish Foundation?
- No.
- Oh, I know what it was.
In my defense, I didn't realize he was my boyfriend's twin until halfway into hooking up with him, and at that point, you know, it's a sunk cost.
I don't hate you at all.
I mean, you were dealt a pretty tough hand.
You essentially had to raise yourself, but you were still more confident and self-possessed at 13 than I ever was.
I mean, seeing your whole life all laid out like this, it's it's remarkable.
Okay, so you still love me.
You're still horny for me, blah, blah, blah.
Then what's wrong?
I'm not good enough for you.
I mean, look at my file.
It is 1/10 as long as yours because I did nothing with my life.
Yeah, we're very different, but we already knew that.
Why are you freaking out?
You're cool, confident Chidi now, remember?
I am confident about my feelings for you.
I am also confident that I am a damn drip, and you deserve to be with someone who's not.
Like Nicolas, that fireman that you dated back in 2009.
He rescued people from burning buildings, and he was so hot.
Oh, Nicolas the fireman.
Mmm.
Nicolas.
I can't argue with you on that one, but I love you.
There is no one else I want to be with at least not forever.
I mean, if Frida Kahlo wants to make out with me in Heaven, then you and I are gonna have a conversation, but if you read my file and you're good, then we're good, unless there's something in your file that would freak me out, like you kept out a library book past the due date.
I moved, and it got buried in the bottom of a box.
I put the library in my will to make up for it.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
Relax.
Let's get back to work.
Now, when I press this lever, Tahani will enter the scenario that Megan has designed that will test her ethical decision-making.
Obviously, in the real test, the humans won't know they're being tested, but this should be a good practice run.
Everyone ready?
Hors d'oeuvre?
Why, yes.
Thank you.
- Chain saw bear!
-  Okay, so couple of things.
We're not using chain saw bears anymore, remember?
Right.
Okay, yeah.
What else?
It was mainly that one thing.
Why don't you try again?
And remember, the challenges your test subject faces should smaller and and more relatable.
Okay.
Hors d'oeuvre?
It's salmon cruditÃ©s.
Is it farm-raised salmon?
'Cause I prefer to support sustainable fishing.
Mondays.
Am I right?
Chain saw!
You said smaller and more relatable.
The bear is smaller, humans hate Mondays and love bacon.
What do you want from me?
Michael, can I try?
I can show them what you're trying to do.
Fine, Vicky.
Go ahead.
Now, first, I need to get into Tahani's headspace.
'Ello, love.
Pish-posh.
Tuna and pickles.
I once played billiards with Questlove and Olivia Munn.
Yeah, there she is.
Okay, just give me a second.
Whew.
Just finished reading up about James Buchanan.
Definitely at least a little bi.
I'm gonna put him in the maybe pile.
I want nachos.
Is there a snack bar here?
What's going on, dog?
I know you're upset.
You have a tell.
- I do?
- Yeah, you "telled" Eleanor before that you were upset, and I think you still are.
Looking at Eleanor's life made me realize how different we are.
If the system works and we both pass our tests, I don't see any version of eternity where she doesn't get bored of me.
I mean, my fake heaven was a 600-square-foot apartment that was essentially a bookcase and a toilet, and I loved it.
So what?
It's cool that you guys are so different.
Sometimes two people who have nothing in common get together, and it rules.
- Opposites attract.
- Well, you need that to be true because you're dating Janet.
Ultimate opposites.
So, what, are you saying Janet might get bored of me?
No, that's not I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean Man Oh, no.
No, Jason, come back.
I  I wish I were back in my toilet library.
And places.
And action.
Can you believe we're still having this dinner for Kamilah?
So embarrassing.
She doesn't know this yet, but I heard that the reviews for her new album are going to be dreadful.
The rumor is that the label is going to drop her.
I heard she may have to fly home coach and check a bag, whatever that means.
-  -  Thank you, everyone, for coming to celebrate our daughter Kamilah.
I know you're all very busy these days.
Just look at our other daughter, Tahani.
She had to come straight from the gym.
Would anyone like to say a few words of praise about Kamilah's latest album or any other aspect of Kamilah?
There are so many to celebrate.
Perhaps Tahani should speak.
She's had her share of failures recently.
Celebrating me could be therapeutic.
Certainly.
I can say something.
But I have no idea what.
Goodness, this is hard.
Well done, Vicky.
That was quite good for the system.
For me, it was rather traumatic.
Okay, so, like, her parents were the chain saw bear, but instead of chopping off her head, they chopped off her self-esteem?
Yes, Megan.
Good.
Take what you know about them and then force them into moments of personal difficulty.
Think of it as flattening the penises of their heart.
Oh.
Now it makes sense.
Why don't you go deeper into her file and look for other ways to challenge her?
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down here.
Vicky's example was fine.
There was some good stuff there.
But overall, uh, C-plus.
It was a C-plus, I'd say.
There are some problems with it, some technical issues that only I can see and everything.
So, basically, it actually kind of stunk.
So I think it's just best if you leave, Vicky.
This is not working.
You're bad at this.
C-plus.
Okay, good-bye.
Wow.
Same old Michael.
Just can't share the spotlight.
- Hmm.
- Well, good-bye, everyone.
That's a wrap on Vicky.
Michael, why did you fire Vicky?
Look, I know she did well on the first test, but it's beginner's luck.
There's an X factor here a secret sauce that only I truly know how to pour over the the juicy s-steak of this process.
I've never said this before, but what?
Not only is Vicky good at test design, but she's good at teaching the others.
Well, that's the problem.
She's moving too fast.
We have to learn how to walk before we can run.
So, first, you thought it would take forever, and now it's moving too fast?
First of all, you know, uh, shut up.
A-and second of all, just shut up.
-  - It's obvious what's going on here.
You don't want your nemesis - to be the one to solve your problem.
- I know that feeling.
Once, on Earth, I didn't know something, and I had to ask Alexa.
I felt dirty.
No, that's not it.
I'm upset, because for hundreds of years, I've had a job.
First, it was finding a better way to torture humans, then helping them, then proving the system was broken, then teaching the demons.
I have to roll a rock up a hill over and over, and then it kept rolling down, so I had to do it again.
And then Vicky comes along with this like, rock-lifter thing and just lifts it to the top of the hill.
Pushing the rock up the hill gave me a purpose.
Who am I if the rock's gone?
Ironically, that's exactly what Vin Diesel asked me when Dwayne Johnson refused to appear in "The Fast and the Furious 9".
Not helpful?
Copy that.
Honestly Michael, I don't know what's to become of you or any of us.
But getting Vicky back is the best chance to make your plan work now, so focus on that and deal with the future in the future.
Hey.
Um I'm sorry I said that before, man.
No, you were right.
Janet and I are different.
Maybe it can't last.
Maybe we're like the Montagues and Capulets.
How do you know that?
I read some books, man.
Jeez.
Uh, listen.
Maybe on paper, you and Janet don't make total sense, but who cares?
The relationship you have built together is wonderful.
She knows you and loves you, and that's all that matters.
- Do you really believe that?
- Of course I do.
Sucker!
Sorry?
I got you so bad.
Dude, pretend what you just said was what you said to you instead of to me.
And you have to listen to yourself, because it was already in your own head and then came out.
But just put it back in your head, and realize that it was you talking about you and Eleanor.
Against all odds, I know what you mean, and I-I got to give it up.
That was that was good.
Yeah, it was.
Chess mate.
Hey!
There she is.
Where you off to?
I have an ice-cold yoga class.
It's amazing.
You pull so many muscles.
-  - What do you want?
I-I'm sorry that I kicked you out.
I-It wasn't about you.
It was just my own insecurities getting in the way.
Will you please come back?
No.
I'm not gonna let myself be degraded by you again.
I am a strong, independent acid snake in the skin suit of a strong, independent woman.
Listen, listen, uh You were the best part of my original Neighborhood.
I took you for granted, and that was wrong.
But now I want to give you the role of a lifetime.
You're going to run the whole project.
I'll give you all my plans and my notes, but then I'll I'll step back, and and you'll take over.
Full creative control like a director.
What do you say?
Well, um that sounds great, but it won't work.
Everyone here hates you so much, if you just put me in control, they'll think I'm your puppet.
I can't have any of your dingleberry stank on me.
I know.
That's why I'm not giving it to you.
You're going to take it.
Hey.
So, uh I was being stupid.
And Jason gave me some really good advice.
Classic us.
Look, who we were on Earth is a tiny part of who we are and an even smaller part of who we are together.
So I'm sorry for freaking out.
But also, some day when we get to the Good Place, I'm gonna learn to play the guitar so you don't get bored of me.
I actually prefer drummers.
Read my file.
Sorry for the delay.
Now, for this next phase of the training - Stop right there.
- Vicky?
I thought I got rid of you, and now you're coming through the door unexpectedly?
That's right.
I'm launching a coup.
My, my, my, we've got some history, don't we?
But I am still standing, Mikey boy.
And right now I'm taking over.
Explain what you mean for me and everyone else.
Oh, this is my training now.
You're done.
And all of these demons are behind me, right, guys?
- Yep.
- Yeah.
All right, Vicky, you win this time.
- Tahani, Janet, let's go.
- Hmm.
No, but wait, wait.
We're we're still fighting.
And it's so heated that, um, it might just erupt into  The dance battle from "West Side Story".
No, I'm I'm too upset about the coup thing.
Hurry up, hurry up, before she starts singing.
Welcome.
Welcome, everyone.
Come on in.
Good Place Architects to my left, Bad place Architects to my right.
Get your files and orientation packets.
Classes begin in 30 minutes.
Oh, also, my "Movement for Lava Monsters" class is now full.
Aw, man.
You got the rock up the hill.
And it looks like it's gonna stay there.
Now we just have to find your next rock.
Well, the first bunch of Neighborhoods is up and running.
- What now?
-  That's the sound when someone gets into the Good Place.
Who was it?
Prince?
It's got to be Prince.
Honestly, if it wasn't Prince, this whole thing is screwed up, and we got to start over.
No.
It's you guys.
For real?
The Judge agreed that the four of you don't need to take the test.
Turns out that saving every soul in the universe is worth a few points.
You're in.
I know, I know.
It's real this time.
I promise.
Get in.
Are you coming, too?
Yeah, I figured I would.
Recently unemployed.
Might as well do some traveling.
-  - Shall we?
Oh.
- See ya.
-  Bye.
Foles!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1  We're finally headed to the Good Place.
It's the "me" of places!
I-I got in, I can say stuff like that again.
Are you sure we're going the right way, Janet?
Well, I've never been to the Good Place before, but yes, I'm sure.
- How?
- Because it feels like I'm on my way home.
Flying puppy!
You're almost there!
Just a little further.
Flying puppies?
Dang it, Michael, why didn't you think of that for your neighborhood?
These guys are good.
- -   I feel just like Dorothy when she lands in Oz.
Excited, incredulous, much taller than everyone else around me.
What's everyone wanna do first?
Racing go-karts with monkeys.
Sure.
It's my lifelong dream.
Monkeys are the ideal go-kart opponents.
They're funny enough to give the finger, but not smart enough to win.
- - Does that mean me?
You're a Good Janet, and we're in the Good Place.
I don't know who else it would mean.
Okay.
No pressure.
I was born to do this not born.
-  -  Okay, so I now know all the information about the Good Place.
In a nutshell, it slaps.
First thing to tell you: humans can't see the Good Place all at once or their brains will be scrambled.
Cool, maybe I'll finally get some of those squigglies on my brain.
Doctor said my brain's as smooth as an egg.
You all need to wait out here for a bit so you can adjust.
When you're ready, you will be honored with a welcome gala magically planned by the Good Place based on your personalities.
Like the "targeted Instagram ad" of parties!
You know, I bought the coolest sunglasses from one of those ads.
-  - Look.
- Whoa.
-  It's like I'm inside the Internet.
Okay, can we just keep moving?
You look a little pale.
Did you get sick from the hot air balloon?
I bet if you throw up it'll just be butterflies - or something.
- I'm fine, I just um I don't belong here.
There's no telling what will happen to a demon who steps foot in this place.
Promise me if I'm vaporized, you guys just keep having fun.
-  - Oh, my goodness, that chime is so soothing, it feels like my brain is being massaged -  by a baby deer?
- Oh, boy.
What if that's some sort of demon alarm to alert the cops that I'm here?
You want me to hold your weed?
- I don't have weed.
-  Oh Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, okay, now I do.
Take this.
They're ready for you to move inside.
The Good Place Committee is waiting for us.
- -  - - Oh, man.
Look at this place!
Karlie Kloss did like me!
I knew it!
So about this party is everyone in the Good Place invited?
Like, is Aristotle gonna be there?
Sorry, Chidi, Aristotle's in the Bad Place.
- He defended slavery.
- Socrates?
No, too annoying.
Very loud chewer.
- Plato.
- Slavery again.
Oh, you know who is here?
Hypatia of Alexandria.
- Do you know her?
- Hypatia?
- Of Alexandria.
- That's right.
Uh, yeah, I know her.
Ooh, Hypatia!
I'm gonna ask her so many questions pertaining to the grand ideas about the universe, like: "Why"?
Oh, oh, and also "How"?
- Ooh.
- Welcome to the Good Place, everyone.
Michael, so happy you made it.
You look radiant.
You have the calming yet authoritative presence of a bomb-sniffing dog.
I'd just like to say, thank you so much for letting me be here with my friends.
I know it's unorthodox for someone like myself to visit the Good Place, but it's just so wonderful, and I don't have any weed on me, so no need for the cops.
-  - Michael, Michael.
You and your friends are heroes.
And you're more than welcome here.
In fact, we have some very exciting news.
While the rest of you get settled in, we want to give Michael a swearing-in ceremony so he can become an official Good Place Architect.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Michael, please, follow us.
Holy fork, that is a soothing chime.
It really is the most incredible chime I've ever heard, and that is coming from someone whose godfather is the most famous clock in the world.
Is Big Ben somehow your godfather?
- Mm-hmm.
- That sound means it's party time.
When you walk through, the event space will transform into a party perfectly tailored to your essences.
Let's link arms and walk through together.
- Weird - Whoa.
This is the Jacksonville SuperSuites Hotel ballroom where I had my prom and also traffic court.
But this has to be my party, because that's the bed pan that Stone Cold Steve Austin used to beat up Vince McMahon in 1998!
It was a classic moment.
Don't judge me.
I'm so sorry, guys.
The Good Place uses your life experiences to plan the perfect party, but it's only designed for one person at a time.
When you walked in as a group, it became A mishmash of all four of us.
It's perfect.
Um, no it's not, Eleanor, because there's no go-kart track and no monkeys.
No offense, but you're being a real smooth brain right now.
See those Green Doors?
You can use them to visit any time or place, real or imagined.
Just think about where you wanna go, and what you wanna do, and walk on through.
So, one could walk amongst the dinosaurs, or witness the very first production of "Hamlet" at the Globe Theater.
I'ma go Tokyo drift with monkeys!
See you in a thousand years!
Do you mind if I go find Hypatia?
I-I promise it's strictly platonic.
Technically Neoplatonic.
- Whoops.
- Forget I made that joke and come with me.
I'm so nervous to meet her, and I need someone cool there to change the subject if I say something dumb.
Sure, give me one sec.
Hey, Tahani.
This room is filled with some of the most interesting people that ever lived.
Chat them up, learn about their lives, then meet back here so that we can make fun of them.
Eleanor Shellstrop.
I have been training for this day my entire life.
I am so honored by this gesture.
This feels right.
This will be my new purpose.
Everything's falling into place.
Great, let's get to it.
Just put on this ceremonial robe.
Ha!
Boy, do you have the shoulders for a robe.
- Oh.
- Just sign this scroll.
I've never signed my name before.
What signature type to choose?
A "Doctor blob," or no, "Athlete who doesn't really care about the kid".
Oh, wait, no.
"Middle school girl with crush on Zac Efron".
That way, I can put a little heart over the "I".
Perfect, and here is your official medal.
Now I know what Mary Lou Retton feels like.
And great, now you are officially in charge of the Good Place.
I'm sorry.
"In charge"?
Yup, you're the boss now.
That was all legally binding, and we all quit, effective immediately.
That is irreversible, so it's all your problem now.
Don't try to find us, no take-backs.
Okay, bye-bye!
Hurry up, move, move, go, go!
Go, go!
Hello?
Fellow Good Placemen?
Anyone in here?
"Ideas for improving the Good Place".
Oh "Music you can eat".
Oh, boy.
"Giant mini doughnuts, not just regular doughnuts.
Dave will explain".
Dave?
Can you explain?
Hi, are you, uh are you are you Hypatia Of Alexandria?
Yup, how's it hangin'?
It's hanging really well!
Um, I-I gotta say, I was expecting you to be still, you know, Ancient Greek.
Oh, well, we sort of stay current in this place.
One of the big things from Earth recently, um, the Industrial Revolution, the Manhattan Project, Gangnam Style I feel like I get it.
It's really her.
I can just tell, somehow, it's Hypatia of Alexandria.
I know, babe.
Yes it is.
Hi, sorry, I'm Eleanor.
This exuberant weirdo is Chidi.
We're new in town.
First question: How do you get the "of" in your name?
Is it just, like, where you hung out the most?
Like, am I "Eleanor of the Cheesecake Factory Bar"?
Also is it Hy-PAY-shuh, or Hy-PAT-ee-uh?
Or in the Ancient Greek, "who-PUH-tee-uh"?
There's a lot of fun debate about this.
You know what, just call me Patty.
Okay, well, uh  Patty!
I'm a huge fan.
I had a poster of you on my wall in high school.
Actually, it was just a poster of Trinity from "The Matrix," but that's how I imagined you would look because you're so cool!
Oh, is she the reason you got beat up so much?
- She's one of 'em.
- Wanna get a milkshake?
I haven't been around newbies in a while.
You're a little intense.
Let's get a milkshake.
Yeah, they make a milkshake here that's made out of actual stardust.
- It's pretty good.
- Okay!
Yeah!
- Getting milkshakes with Patty.
- Yeah.
But can I ask you a couple of questions first?
Uh, you were a follower of Plotinus, who claimed that contemplation of our ultimate reality Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you what's it called, um a think-book-man?
No, um a think-read-book-man.
- A philosopher, yes.
- Sorry!
It's been so long, my brain is foggy.
Listen carefully before I forget how to say this: you gotta help us, we are so screwed.
We are?
-  - Hello.
I'm Tahani Al-Jamil.
I'm Paltibaal.
Welcome to paradise.
So, what's your story?
Did you cure something, or invent something?
I helped the poor in Ancient Phoenicia.
Excellent!
I once had a Soul Cycle instructor named Phoenicia.
How did you die?
I got a cut on my hand.
The year was 2491 BC, so that's pretty much all it took.
You got a cut, or you drank water that wasn't hot enough, and then boom, dead.
I would've killed for a vaccine.
Any vaccine.
It's crazy that you guys just don't like them now.
So what's your favorite part about living here?
I mean, it's perfect.
We're all having orgasms literally all the time.
I died a virgin, so that's real crazy.
Okay.
It's so nice to get to work alongside another Good Janet.
Yes, it is.
Janet, can I get a Coke?
No, a water.
-  - No, a lamp.
-  - No, a cat.
-  - So, people just ask you for things with no rhyme or reason?
Yes, and then I get them for them.
- It's great.
- Can I get a spaceship?
No, one huge Junior Mint.
-  - No, a Coke.
Wow, this milkshake is incredible.
- Right?
- Mmm!
This is how I spend most of my time.
Sitting in beautiful places, drinking my milkshake, slowly peeing into my pants, which instantly evaporates and leaves no trace.
- Sounds fun.
- Mm.
But didn't you want to tell us how we're all screwed?
Ah!
Damn it!
This is the exact problem!
On paper, this is paradise.
All your desires and needs are met, but it's infinite, and when perfection goes on forever, you become this glassy-eyed mush person.
But no!
Because No.
Because, Patty, no!
Yes, I'm telling you.
I used to be cool, man.
I studied so much things.
Art and music and the, um, the one with the number piles?
Where I'd be like, "Two"!
and you'd be like, "Six"!
- Math?
- Yes!
And then I came here where time stretched out forever, and every second of my existence was amazing, but my brain became this big dumb blob.
So we finally make it into the Good Place, and now we're just gonna become zombies?
Why haven't you told anyone about this?
About what?
- Dude!
- Damn it!
We have to find the others.
Right now.
Look, there's math on my shirt.
- Come on!
- Is it an "S" or a math?
Have you seen Eleanor and Chidi?
There's something very wrong with this party, and it's not just that the caviar is being served on top of Jell-O shots.
We are the first new people here in 500 years, and no one seems to care.
I know, even the Good Janets are kind of weird.
They're like, "Hi, there"!
When I do it, it's cool, but when they do it, it's lame.
Hey, guys.
Having fun?
Great.
So, little update.
Um, the Good Place is a disaster.
Everyone here is a happiness zombie, and no one is doing anything about it, because by the time they realize it's happening, everyone is too far gone to care.
Oh, dear.
Oh, hello, I'm Tahani.
Hi, I'm milkshake.
Do you want a milkshake?
Okay, we need to tell someone before we're too zonked out to remember why we're here.
- We need to find the Committee.
- The Committee is me.
I am Committee.
It me.
- What?
- They tricked me.
And put me in charge of the Good Place and then literally ran away.
And then what happened?
The sorting hat put you in Hufflepuff?
Roasted.
Come on, I know we have problems.
- You can't expect me to ignore this.
- Hang on, - we're in paradise.
-  Surely, some people here are enjoying themselves.
Hey, guys.
I'm back.
Go-karting with monkeys got boring really fast.
It did?
- Oh, no!
- Damn it!
Jason, your lifelong dream got old that quickly?
I mean, monkeys and go-karts was fun for a while, then I was like, "Oh, you know what'd be cool?
Hippos in go-karts".
And I was like, yo, "What about Draculas with jetpacks"?
I did like 50 combos, and then I just kind of wanted to hang out with you guys again.
Okay, that's it in a nutshell.
'Cause you get here and you realize that anything's possible, and you do everything, and then you're done.
But you still have infinity left.
This place kills fun, and passion, and excitement, and love, till all you have left are milkshakes.
The Good Place Committee obviously knew about this.
Why didn't they try and solve it?
They did.
They tried everything.
Just last week, they made the unicorns bigger, and then they gave them more horns, and then they made them chubbier.
I mean, really, they just made a bunch of weird fluffy rhinos.
The Committee members aren't human, so they couldn't understand the problem.
The second I showed up, they jumped off this sinking ship and made me captain.
Well, I'm not giving up.
We worked too hard and went through too much.
And I'm not just gonna sit back and turn into some slack-jawed sweatpant-wearing orgasm machine.
Oh, my God, I'm describing my dream existence like it's bad.
What is wrong with this place?
We just redesigned this system, and soon millions of people are going to start pouring in thinking they're in paradise, only to become a joyless husk.
It's Coachella.
We've invented Cosmic Coachella.
Oh, we have to fix this.
What if we do what I did to you in the original Neighborhood?
Erase their memory every once in a while?
That way, paradise would seem fresh and new.
You were doing that to torture us.
Actual paradise can't use the same playbook as hell.
Okay, well, I have a solution.
Remember what I said to you when you were going through your "midlife crisis, one earring, red convertible" phase?
- "You look so stupid".
- After that.
You said that every human is a little bit sad all the time, because you know you're gonna die.
But that knowledge is what gives life meaning.
The way to restore meaning to the people in the Good Place is to let them leave.
Leave?
And go where?
This is the last Oh.
Can we just do that?
You're the head of the Good Place now.
Seems to me, you can do whatever you want.
Where's Michael?
Okay.
Nothing to do but announce the big change.
Whatever happens, it's cool, my babies.
It's very cool.
Did you smoke that weed, bud?
I did.
I was kind of freaked out, so I smoked some grass, but now I'm great.
Let's change the afterlife, - and then Taco Bell.
- All right.
-  - Oh!
- Baby!
- Okay.
I'm gonna do the talking.
Hi, everyone, can I have your attention, please?
Hi, my name's Eleanor Shellstrop.
Hope you're having fun at our Flor-izona British library extravaganza.
I guess you don't really have fun anywhere, which is the point.
It doesn't seem like this is paradise for you.
You've basically been on a never-ending vacation, and vacations are only special because they end.
So we have an idea.
We're gonna set up a new kind of door.
Um, somewhere peaceful, so that when you feel happy and satisfied and complete, and you want to leave the Good Place for good, you can just walk through it, and your time in the universe will end.
You don't have to go through it if you don't want to, but you can, and hopefully, knowing that you don't have to be here forever will help you feel happier while you are.
What will happen when we go through it?
Well, we don't really know, exactly.
All we know is, it will be peaceful, and your journey will be over.
You led great lives.
You earned your place here.
So stay here as long as you like.
Use the Green Doors to see and do every single thing you want to see and do.
And when you're ready walk through one last door, and be at peace.
Does that sound good?
Seems like they're into it.
It's DJ music, make some noise!
That's my boyfriend!
I'm glad you'll be able to enjoy things again.
Art, math, philosophy, like you used to.
Yeah, me too.
I've been dreaming of ending the ennui of this eternal existence for a long time, but now I think I'll stick around for a while.
It felt good to, uh make brain words.
Still mushy.
I'll get it back.
We're lucky we ran into you.
It saved us.
That's not what saved you.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- It was your friendships.
- Yeah, I know, I got it.
Oh.
Sorry.
Still not sharp.
Kept most of it the same.
Even made myself a office nearby.
Jason, I-I  Kind of took a wild guess.
I finally get to accomplish my goal of living in a Stupid Nick's!
I know anything you do for eternity gets boring, but I swear I will never get sick of wings!
Well, I'll see you all tomorrow.
And every tomorrow after that.
You know, Michael, at the end of the day, you were right.
Everything is fine.
Hmm.
This is what we've been looking for since the day we met.
Time.
I think that's what the Good Place really is.
It's not even a place, really, it's just having enough time with the people you love.
You're right.
And we have as long as we want.
If you keep hogging this blanket, I'm probably gonna walk through that door in, like, three days, so   - I'll miss you.
-
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1  Attempt number 803 of my new project.
This is the one.
I can feel it.
I'm ready.
And here we go.
Riding on a groovy wave of love I'm going for a cosmic ride Surf the freaky purple vibes of love The marshmallow cat Is inside "The marshmallow cat is inside"?
That's what I wrote?
That's meaningless.
- Janet.
- Hi, there.
How's the songwriting going?
I'm completely lost here, and I can't do the stupid E chord.
Would you like a magic guitar that plays all the notes for you?
It's the number one request among men over 50 who have gotten in here.
No, the whole point is to learn how to do stuff without using afterlife magic.
You know, maybe keep it on deck.
- I don't know, whatever.
- We should go, by the way.
We're gonna be late.
Oh, where does the time go?
Surfing the freaky purple  So ultimately, this all goes back to a line from Professor May's book: "Mortality offers meaning to our lives, and morality helps navigate that meaning".
Wait, what I think it says is that mortality offers meaning to the events of our lives.
Uh, check yourself, rando.
I think Chidi Anagonye, who literally designed the afterlife, knows what he's talking about.
Look, I'm pretty sure I'm right, since it's, like, my book.
Yes, Professor May, you're probably right about what you wrote.
Still think he should check himself.
Okay, everyone, we'll see you all here next week.
Professor Hieronymi will be teaching the trolley problem.
Bring ponchos.
It gets messy.
You ready, Chidi?
Hello, Jeff.
I see the collection's grown.
Sure has.
I have 322 frog things now.
323!
I just got another one!
Ha!
Never not excited about frogs, that guy.
He knows what he likes.
This meeting of the Joint Council of Afterlife Affairs is called to order.
Let's make this quick, kids.
I just started rewatching "The Leftovers".
Honestly, when I found out that Carrie Coon was never nominated, I almost erased 2% of humanity.
Michael, update?
Things are going fairly well.
A new crop of humans just passed their tests.
Among the notables who got in, Roberto Clemente, Zora Neale Hurston, - Saint Thomas Aquinas - Yes!
Eighth-century Sufi mystic poet Hazrat Bibi Rabia Basri, and Clara Peller.
She was the "Where's the beef"?
lady.
- Oh.
- "Where's the beef"?
lady got in.
So, that's fun.
Honestly, our biggest problem is that we need more architects and actors.
Well, sorry, but these younger demon actors have no dedication to their craft.
They think they can just start acting.
They have to learn that acting is reacting, and reacting is pre-acting, but pre-acting, well, that's just being.
Okay, take it down a notch, Daniel Day-Lewis.
- Shawn, what you got?
- Well, I'll begin by saying that this new system stinks, and Michael stinks, and we should throw this all in the garbage and go back to the way it used to be when everyone was tortured.
There's still some bumps in the road, but this system is good, and it's working.
Come on, admit it.
I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, admit that.
I know, buddy.
I know.
What time is it?
I don't know.
Really?
Yeah.
At one point, hundreds of Bearimies ago, I turned off my ability to know what time it is anywhere in the universe when you and I are together.
I like not knowing.
It's 10:42 a.m. Sorry.
Saying out loud that I didn't know something made me feel weird.
Man, I feel weird when I do know something.
You and I are very different.
Okay, gotta go meet my dad.
I'm gonna try one more time.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
I'm freaking out, man.
You got this, dawg.
One more play, for all the marbles.
I love you, and I believe in you.
Thanks, Dad.
Okay.
-  - Here we go.
Bortles gonna throw.
Yes!
You did it!
It took you more than 433,000 tries, but you just played the perfect game of Madden!
You did it!
That's my boy.
That's my boy.
I did it.
- Janet?
- Hi, there.
Hi, Janet.
I made dinner.
You always make it for me, so this time, I wanted to make it, and real talk, it didn't go great.
This is spaghetti.
Now, I know it looks weird, but I bit off a chunk, and actually, it's pretty bad.
Also, I put out the forks and knives the way kings and queens do it.
Close to the plates.
- Also - Uh-oh.
Oh, dip.
Yeah.
So I need to talk to everyone.
Should I ask them to come here?
No, I I had a better idea.
-  -  - Hello, you two.
- Hi.
What fun meeting back here.
Wow, you even restored it to the way it used to look.
What inspired this, J-Dog?
You get a hankering for frozen yogurt?
No.
I have an announcement to make.
I'm leaving.
Going through the door.
Wow.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I am.
It's time.
We thought the best move was to gather everyone together for a sort of farewell party.
We're gonna eat and drink, and there will be dancing.
Fun.
Whee!
Okay, homies, you're sad.
I can tell 'cause you have the same looks on your faces that my teachers did whenever I raised my hand in class.
But let's be happy.
I'm gonna DJ!
We'll play EDM all night.
- Come on.
- Come on.
-  - Oof.
Now I'm bummed about two things.
- Hey there, Doug.
- Hi.
- Having fun?
- I've had so much chicken!
It's probably good you chose your young body.
Yeah.
How are you doing?
I'm okay, Michael.
How are you?
Well, I'm sad, and I know you're the most advanced being in the universe, but I feel like I need to tell you, it's okay if you're sad too.
I know.
And I am a little, but also, I know this is the right time for him to leave.
I really am okay, I promise.
Will you come talk to me if you're not?
Always.
How y'all doing tonight?
Okay, homies, we got a real special treat.
My old dance crew Dance Dance Resolution is here.
Y'all ready to tear it up one last time?
Yes!
Yes!
That was special.
I'll never forget this night.
Until I walk through the door and dissolve into the universe.
Can I ask you something, buddy?
How did you know?
It wasn't like I heard a bell ring or anything.
I just suddenly had this calm feeling, like the air inside my lungs was the same as the air outside my body.
It was peaceful.
You know the feeling when you think a jalapeÃ±o popper is gonna be too hot, but you bite into it anyway and it's actually the perfect temperature?
Believe it or not, I do know that feeling.
- That feeling rules.
- There you go!
Uh, can I get your advice on something?
I'm scared Janet's gonna forget me.
Her falling in love with someone else, I'm fine with that.
Like, if Jason Momoa or if Lara Croft Tomb Raider gets in, and Janet's like, "That's what's up," totally cool, but her forgetting me would be sad, so I made her this.
What do you guys think?
It's lovely.
But she's not gonna forget you, man.
I mean, she literally can't.
She remembers everything that ever happened.
Even if she could forget someone, I don't think she's gonna forget you.
Thanks.
When I had Jason, I was 18 years old.
In many ways, Jason raised me just as much as I raised him.
So, thanks for being a great dad, son.
I love you, Dad!
Jason is the realest dude ever.
I mean, none of us are real anymore.
We're all just Caspers the Ghost and whatnot, which is funny 'cause me and Jason ain't even white.
Why are all ghosts white?
Aw, dip.
Are ghosts racist?
What I'm trying to say is, I love you, dawg, you're my hero, you're my best friend, and you're my Gardner Minshew.
You can sit on that bench as long as you want.
Whenever you're ready, you just walk through.
I love you, Janet.
I love you too, Jason.
I hope you have a nice rest of eternity.
- Hmm.
- I made you something.
Aw, dip, I lost it.
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.
I made you this cool thing so you remember me even when you're married to Aquaman, and I lost it somewhere in this forest.
Some magical squirrel probably ate it.
Jason, it's okay.
I'm never gonna forget you.
In fact, to me, you won't even really be gone.
I don't experience time the same way you do.
I kind of live all times at once.
I know what you mean.
Once, I smoked salvia, and saw the past and the future at the same time.
Then I tried to brush my teeth with my cat.
To me, remembering moments with you is the same as living in them.
Can you just remember the happy times and forget the bad stuff?
There was no bad stuff.
It was all good.
Wow.
These spindles are gorgeous.
And there's almost a feeling of musculature to this transition.
The oak just sort of told me the shape before I even got to the spoke shave.
This under-bevel is a great trick.
It really makes it feel lighter while leaving you plenty of beef to carve.
It's really just a modified Danish line.
Still, you made it your own.
This is as good a chair as I've seen.
I have nothing left to teach you.
Hurrah!
Thank you!
Janet!
- Hi there.
- Call up the list please.
Congratulations.
Actually, I just finished repaving my driveway yesterday, so cross that one off too.
Before you start your next project, you should know, that thing that you asked me to tell you when it happened?
It happened.
I mean, they've gone through the system, so they'll be a little different, right?
One would hope.
I've never had lunch with Mum and Dad.
I've only ever stood silently behind their chairs while they ate lobster tail with Oscar de la Renta.
I'm right here.
We will get through this together.
Here we go.
Mother, Father, welcome to My darlings!
My darlings.
Oh!
Oh, my little girls.
We love you both so much.
So very much.
We have a million things to talk to you about, but first, we are sorry.
We'll just be endlessly sorry forever and ever.
Holy crap.
I know, right?
Ugh.
For the 1,000,000th time, they've sent us teddy bears and flowers.
You think they'd understand that we can get these things ourselves if we want.
Ah, that's lovely.
Thanks.
You know, I never thought I would say this, but I'm getting a little bored of Mum and Dad telling us how much they love us.
Yes.
Isn't that something?
Well, this may not come as a surprise to any of you, but I'm ready to go.
Aw, nuts.
I knew it.
- You finished everything on your list?
- I did.
I learned how to install a bathtub, fly a helicopter, defuse a bomb, deliver the perfect backhand slice.
My last goal was to spend one meaningful day with my parents, and now I've spent thousands of them.
I feel complete.
Would you like me to prepare a farewell party for you?
No need.
I've done it myself.
I've cooked all the food, mixed all the drinks, made all the furniture, repainted all the walls, and trained all the animals.
Champagne?
Uh, sure.
Thank you, panda.
Also, I've already said good-bye to everyone else in my life.
My sister, my parents, B and J. They took it very hard.
Tonight, it's just us.
I hate to tell you this, but your risotto was just a little sticky.
- Was it?
- No, damn it, it was amazing.
Just trying to figure out a way to get you to hang around for a few more Bearimies.
-  - Can I tell you something?
You're my role model.
Come on.
- I'm serious.
- Babe, you were already the most impressive person I ever met, and now you can do literally everything.
If that's true, it's because you inspired me.
I admire you so very much.
Your strength, your toughness, your self-esteem, not to mention you have a rocking bod.
Did you just turn the tables on me?
I got nothing left to teach you.
- Janet.
- Hi there.
One more goal to add to the list please.
- - Now cross it off.
I know we already said good-bye.
I'm not even here.
I just had to see you one last time, because I hooked up with Alexander the Great!
And it was more like Alexander the Fine.
Okay, anyway, I love you, I love you, good-bye forever.
- Bye, love!
- Bye!
I admire your breadth of knowledge.
I can only do one thing: be an architect.
I've spent the last 500 Bearimies trying to learn how to play the guitar, and I just mastered "Hey There Delilah".
Don't sell yourself short, Michael.
I dare say you're the greatest architect in existence, and I should know.
Frank Gehry is my godfather.
Fair enough.
I deserved that.
Oh, Tahani, I'm gonna miss you, babe.
Wait.
I don't want to leave.
Great!
Then stay.
New party, everyone.
- A staying party.
- Whoo!
No.
I-I also don't want to stay.
I'm done here, but I don't want to go there.
It's kind of your only options.
No, they aren't.
I want to learn to do what you do, Michael.
I want to be an architect.
Design afterlives.
Tahani, you're a wonderful person, but you're a person.
It's impossible.
Nonsense!
I can learn.
Just like I learned all this other stuff.
I've spent most of my life pretending to help people.
If I were an architect, I could do it for real.
Let me at least try.
Don't make me talk to your manager.
- Oh!
-  Ooh!
- That's my girl!
- Oh.
Hey, Jeff.
Boy, kind of getting away from you here, huh?
Yeah.
I love frogs though, so it's awesome.
I did bring you one.
Oh, thanks, Tahani.
Just toss it on the pile.
Hang on, hang on.
So, you can never tell a woman to smile?
What if she'd legitimately be prettier if she smiled?
- - Aren't I helping her?
Glenn, Beadie, this is your new intern, Tahani.
Tahani!
This is so neat.
I haven't seen you since I was exploded into goo.
I didn't get any me on you, did I?
You did, but it's all goo under the bridge.
Anyway, I want to learn everything.
I shall start at the bottom and earn my way up.
To wit, would anyone like a cup of antimatter?
Sure, I take mine with nondairy neutrinos.
Coming right up.
Thank you, Michael, for everything.
You're welcome.
I brought you a little "first day on the job" present.
Once you're a big deal around here, I hope you don't mind if I brag about knowing you.
Name-dropping's a little gauche, Michael, but do as you must.
Hmm.
"Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task".
Boom!
I did it!
It only took me 2,000 Bearimies, but I finally finished that book.
Ha-ha, sucker!
Reading you was an unending task, but I freaking did it!
- Congrats, babe.
- Thanks.
- What are you reading?
- "The Da Vinci Code".
- Really?
- Yeah, after a thousand lifetimes of reading the most difficult writings in the world, I've acquired a new passion.
Garbage books.
Hey, do you think I would've been a good symbologist, if that were a real job?
Yes, I do.
Ya very cute.
- Come on.
We gotta go to dinner.
- Oh.
I cannot believe she learned to cook this well.
When I first met Tahani on Earth, she was trying to shove jewelry into a vending machine.
Okay, well, if she is an architect, then she should design my idea.
A karaoke room that's also a tanning bed.
Ooh, yes, and, like, the harder you commit to the song, like, the tanner you get?
I gotta say, I am so glad that going through the system did not totally change you two ding-dongs.
-  - Oh.
For dessert, we have to get the tiramisu.
Man.
Chidi Anagonye just casually making choices.
I never thought I'd live to see it.
I mean, I guess I didn't.
- Oh, that's right!
-  'Cause we're all dead!
That was so fun.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's always fun to see them.
Every time we do it, it's fun.
I had coffee with my mom the other day, and she says hi, but she also finally learned how to pronounce your mom's name.
Which is good.
Yeah, yeah, they were joking about that last time we saw them.
- Mm.
- Remember?
Oh, right.
Yeah.
Shakespeare went through the door.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Everyone's talking about it.
- It's probably for the best.
His last 4,000 plays were not nearly as good as the ones he wrote on Earth.
I mean, did you see "The Tempest 2: Here We Blow Again"?
Woof.
You mind if we go home?
I'm tired.
Sure.
- All right.
- Okay.
Um I'm gonna get ready for bed.
Cool.
I'm gonna take a little stroll.
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.
Dude.
Oh, hey, perfect.
Are these good lyrics?
The psychedelic stardust and moonbeam banana No, stop, that's terrible, and we got a problem.
I think Chidi's gonna leave.
Really?
Did he say he was ready?
He didn't say exactly that, but he's getting close.
I can tell.
I need to do something to shake things up, you know?
Light a spark.
Oh!
Janet?
- Hi there.
- Hi.
I think Chidi's almost ready to walk through the door, and I need to keep him here, so, um, can you make me a bed shaped like a giant highlighter and, like, a sexy edible valedictorian robe?
No, I think this calls for something spiritual.
Ah, okay, but if I do this right, my man's gonna be talking to God.
You know what I mean?
Wait, what do you mean?
Forgive me, Eleanor, but if Chidi's ready to go, it's time for him to go.
Ah, he didn't say that yet though.
We're in classic Chidi grey area.
You need to remind him of what's great about this place.
Oh, oh.
Remember where he took us, like, the first month - when we were all together?
- Oh, great idea.
Yes.
- Janet, set the scene.
- Okay.
Would you like it restored to its original glory?
No.
The first time he went, he was in college.
Have it look and feel exactly like it was that day when he fell in love with it.
Also, pack me the edible robe.
That might seal the deal.
Okay.
You're all set.
Hey, guess what?
Surprise trip.
Come on.
Surprise trip?
Now?
Yeah.
Special fun trip, just us two.
Let's go.
Can I change out of my pajamas first?
Let the door do it!
Come on!
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Oh.
Oh, man, Eleanor.
Right?
We haven't been here in so long.
Athens.
Man, this city, it takes my breath away every time.
Talk it out, bud.
Tell me everything you know about this place because, full disclosure, I didn't really listen the first time you told me.
Well, I mean, that's the Acropolis.
Oh, and this is the Pnyx.
Thousands of Athenians would gather here and listen to people discuss their city and its laws from that stage right there.
This is literally where democracy started.
Well, that's fine and dandy, but as you may know, I'm kind of a philosophy gal.
Where were the big brains hanging out?
Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Diogenes, they all gathered right here in the agora.
It was like the Avengers, but for super thinkers.
Oh, come on.
You brought me here.
You knew what was gonna happen.
No, I love that you're so happy.
Hey, let me ask you something.
Is it weird that when I picture ancient Greeks, I make them really hot?
Like, to me, Aristotle is basically John Stamos with a beard.
Honestly, that's kind of how I picture him too.
Good, same page.
What's this called again?
Koulouvi?
Koulouri, and I lived on these when I was here.
I like to picture young Chidi Anagonye here, reading, nerding out, treating himself to a koulouri, if he had an astute insight into Aristotelian virtue ethics.
Oh, that is accurate.
That is an accurate picture of 20-year-old me.
This was so special.
Thank you.
Should we head home?
Nope, because we're not done yet.
There's more special trip.
- Janet?
- Hi there.
You enjoying your trip, Chidi?
Yes, we are, but it's not over yet.
We are ready to head to destination number two.
- Remember?
- Yes, of course.
Head right this way.
Oh, man.
Oh, wow.
Paris.
Yes, Paris, obviously.
My favorite city.
And you even picked the ideal weather.
Overcast and chilly.
Perfect for staying inside and reading.
Is this what you were hinting to me?
I was thinking Six Flags, but this is way better.
I used to come to this cafÃ© every day when I lived here.
I tried to sit in a different seat each time so I could eventually say that I definitely sat in the exact same place as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Richard Wright, Brecht, James Baldwin.
Well, we got all the time in the world now, baby.
Put that booty in a seat warmed by history.
Eleanor, I know what you're doing.
Being the best eternal girlfriend ever?
Guilty.
Let's take a walk.
So, Eleanor, here it is.
I love you, completely and utterly.
Oh, crap.
But I have to go.
But you don't though.
You don't have to go.
You don't have to leave me.
I don't want to leave you.
I'm just ready to leave.
I have the same feeling that the others described, a kind of quietude in my soul.
But you just had it.
What if those other dummies didn't wait long enough, and the feeling fades, and you get to spend another billion Bearimies in fake afterlife Europe with your kickass girlfriend?
I didn't just have it.
I've had it a long time.
Remember that day we were with our parents?
My mom kissed you good-bye, and got lipstick on your cheek, and your mom rubbed it off.
I don't know why that was it, but that was it.
And I didn't want to tell you because because.
No, man, this can't be because Jason's gone, Tahani's off doing her thing, and I'm not ready to go, so if you leave, then I'm alone here.
I was alone my whole life, and I told myself I like it that way, but I don't.
I like being with you.
Okay, I won't go.
- Really?
- Yeah, I won't go.
There's there is still plenty to do.
I'll stay.
Who's ready for Six Flags?
Oh, we're good.
We got it.
He's gonna stay.
Turn into birds and fly to Notre Dame?
Stand at the top of the Eiffel Tower and throw water balloons onto imaginary tourists?
-  - Whatever you want to do.
Okay, well, let's freshen up, have dinner at some schmancy restaurant, order a million-dollar bottle of wine, even though it tastes exactly like cheap, stupid wine, and sit in a room at the George V and watch "Real Housewives" of whatever city they're doing that in now.
Love it.
I'm gonna walk around my old neighborhood.
See where I used to live.
Meet you at the restaurant?
- Yeah.
- All right.
Let's see what's on the menu.
Literally anything you could possibly imagine.
Hmm.
What are you thinking?
"Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task".
That's what I was thinking about.
That sentence.
You want to eat that sentence for dinner?
Can we eat words, 'cause I asked Janet about this and No, no, it's the last line of Scanlon's book.
- Remember?
- Ah.
The whole book is about how we should try to find rules other people can't reasonably reject, and then he ends it by saying, "The search for how to find those rules will go on forever".
I proposed a rule that Chidis shouldn't be allowed to leave because it would make Eleanors sad, and I could do this forever, zip you around the universe showing you cool stuff, and I'd still never find the justification for getting you to stay.
Because it's a selfish rule.
I owe it to you to let you go.
I was never good at being sad.
Partly because my mom straight up told me not to be.
But this is sad, man.
You got a John Locke quote or piece of Kantian wisdom you can throw at me?
Those guys were more focused on rules and regulations.
For spiritual stuff, you gotta turn to the East.
I'll take anything you got.
Hit me.
Picture a wave in the ocean.
You can see it, measure it, its height, the way the sunlight refracts when it passes through, and it's there, and you can see it, you know what it is.
It's a wave.
And then it crashes on the shore, and it's gone.
But the water is still there.
The wave was just a a different way for the water to be for a little while.
That's one conception of death for a Buddhist.
The wave returns to the ocean, where it came from, and where it's supposed to be.
Not bad, Buddhists.
Not bad.
None of this is bad.
I need you to do me one last favor.
Mm-hmm?
Say good-bye to me now, and leave before I wake up.
You can sit on that bench as long as you'd like, and whenever you're ready, you just walk through.
I'm ready.
Oh, dip!
You're back.
- Jason?
- Yeah!
What but how why Funny story.
Remember how I made you something, and I thought I lost it because it wasn't in my pocket?
- Uh-huh?
- Turns out it was in my other pocket!
By the time I found it, you were gone.
I was just gonna leave it for you, but I was worried it would get eaten by that magic squirrel.
So, I decided to wait for you to come back.
Every so often, a different Janet came, but I knew it wasn't you.
Jason, it's been, like, a thousand Bearimies.
I know, but I wanted to see you again.
It was actually pretty easy to wait.
I sort of just sat quietly and let my mind drift away.
Thought about you, and the infinity of the universe.
Kind of like a monk.
What do you mean?
Looks good, not-a-girl.
Chidi, wait up!
Hey-oh!
Time to go nuts, 'cause I brought donuts Huh, no one's here.
Shoot.
That was gonna be a big laugh.
Hey, sweetie.
Did you not get the message?
No.
Why, was the meeting cancelled?
Uh, yeah.
Forever.
We dissolved the council.
- What?
- We don't need it anymore.
Your system's working perfectly.
Millions of humans passing their tests, you know.
Oh, Vicky's really killing it on the training, so it's all good.
Well  All right, well hang on, now.
Look, how are we even sure that this is the right system?
I mean, honestly, I think Shawn was right.
This whole thing sucks and we should start from scratch.
Relax, worrywart.
Take a load off.
Huh?
Enjoy yourself.
You know what I just discovered recently?
Podcasts.
There's, like, a billion of them and they just keep coming.
- Hmm.
- Now scoot.
I got a new Radiolab to listen to about how clams learn.
-  - Pretty excited.
I love you.
And you don't need to respond, 'cause I know you have trouble saying how you feel.
I love you too.
Knock, knock, knock.
Oh.
Hey, what's up?
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah, sure, why not?
- Hey, Derek?
- Yes, Mindy?
What can Derek do for you?
Eleanor and I are gonna talk for a bit, so go into your nether sphere.
That's Derek?
Mindy has rebooted Derek more than 151 million times.
Derek is now both a singular point in space, and yet, Derek also contains space itself.
The nexus of Derek is without dimension.
The moment of Derek's creation and the eventual heat death of the universe are now inexorably the same.
Ugh, you are so annoying!
Want a beer?
So that's how you spend your days?
Wandering around, searching for the thing that makes you complete?
Pretty much.
I thought it was connected to my parents or my friends, but now I think it might be something else.
I think it might be you.
I think my final mission might be to convince you to go through the system.
Take the test.
You know, when I first met you, I thought, "Oof, "well, there's a chick I understand.
Lone wolf, totally independent, knows what she wants".
Cocaine and self-pleasure.
Right.
But I actually think you're a version of me if I'd never met my friends.
You're like the worst-case scenario of what I could have become.
- No offense.
- None taken.
Look, the thing is, Eleanor, I am fine with where I am.
See, I don't think you are.
Or at least, you could be better.
If we're cut from the same cloth, then trust me.
There is greater happiness waiting for you if you form bonds with other people, and I think you know that.
You told me about me and Chidi that time.
You showed me the tape.
You said you were rooting for us.
I think you have the ability to care.
I don't know.
Caring just seems like - a lot of work.
- Mm.
And I have been on my own for so long.
I can't imagine putting my fate in the hands of some stranger.
I thought you might say that.
Hello, gorgeous.
Eleanor.
And Mindy St. Claire, as I neither live nor breathe!
What brings you ladies here?
Trying to convince Mindy to enter the system after all this time.
She's a little worried about who might end up designing her test Say no more.
I'm on the case.
Really?
Are you, like, certified or whatever?
Well, not yet, but it won't be long, right, Shawn?
-  - Oh, I think you'll find that Tahani will be certified very soon.
Did that sound evil?
I didn't mean it to.
I was sincere.
Force of habit.
I do think you'll find that Tahani will be certified ve hmm.
Shut up, Glenn.
Great.
So, you go back to your old life, chill with your floating Derek head, when Tahani gets certified, you enter the system, Tahani designs your test.
Deal?
Why not?
Something new.
Thanks for giving a crap about me.
I don't really give a crap about myself, so it's nice that someone does.
I'm really glad I filmed you having sex.
Me too.
You can sit on that bench as long as you want.
Whenever you're ready, you just walk through.
Well, good, 'cause I'm definitely ready.
I'm ready.
I'm not ready.
Damn it, Janet.
What the fork?
I should be ready and I'm not.
But I am.
Michael, what are you doing?
I'm going through the door.
There's nothing left for me to do.
I feel sated and complete.
I'm not sure you're thinking this through, dude.
Yes, I am.
A calm has washed over me.
Blah, blah, blah.
Good-bye.
Did I go through the wrong way?
Wait, wait, just one minute.
I know this is gonna look silly but it probably will work.
Michael, what are you doing?
I am returning my damn essence to the damn fabric of the damn universe.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Oh, there we go.
It's working now.
It's working.
I'm leaving.
Bye.
It's not working because you're looking.
- Stop looking.
- Michael, that door is not for you.
Why not?
I invented the damn thing!
You know, this stinks.
You guys get to move on, but I am trapped here forever?
How's that fair?
Oh, I got it.
Eleanor, come here.
You go through and give me a piggyback.
- We can trick it.
- Ooh, no.
Ow!
- Ow!
Ow!
Michael, no!
- Hold still well, hold Michael!
All right.
Come with me.
Fire squids are heavy.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
New people are getting in all the time.
Tahani's still around.
Maybe you team up with her, design some afterlife neighborhoods?
I did that already, remember?
Spent 50 Bearimies making new neighborhoods for new residents.
When you've already designed the ultimate one, it's kind of a letdown.
I've loved being here, but Jason's gone.
Chidi's gone.
You know, even Doug Forcett went through the door.
That was probably for the best.
That guy partied so hard when he was here.
I guess I'll just stay here forever, you know?
Putter around doing mundane things like some sad old retiree.
Maybe I'll have Janet make me a hardware store so I can buy a hex wrench that I don't really need.
Cockamamie!
That's what I think of your plan.
I think it's cockamamie.
I think it's a great plan, and I bet deep down, you do too.
It sets a bad precedent.
Babe, no one else is ever gonna want to do this.
Plus, if they ask, you just say, "Sure, pal, "go save every soul in the universe, and then we got a deal".
And think about it this way: If you do this, you'll never have to hear from any of us ever again.
Ooh.
Now that sounds tempting.
'Cause y'all are annoying.
I mean, you did save the universe and all, but your tone.
- It's your tone.
- I know.
Michael?
Come on in.
All my Earth stuff.
Oh, my old bowling ball.
Oh, hi, paper clips.
What prompted all this?
You know, it took me a while to figure it out, but earlier, when you were walking back and forth through the door, it hit me.
You will never be at peace until you get the one thing you truly want.
I'm I'm gonna be A real boy, Pinocchio.
The Judge gave me the power to make you an actual human.
Good-bye, fire squid.
Hello, silver fox.
Oh, Eleanor!
Oh, my goodness!
Now, you need to be sure about this.
You're gonna live down there for, like some amount of time, you'll die, really die, then you'll enter an afterlife test, be judged on what you did, the whole deal.
At least so we think.
While you're down there, this entire system could be changed.
Shawn might launch a coup.
Someone could design a whole new system.
You won't really know what's going to happen to you.
That's what makes it special.
I won't exactly know what's going to happen after I die.
Nothing more human than that.
Besides texting people that you're five minutes away when you haven't even left the house.
Thank you, Eleanor.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Hey, Mike.
Where you headed today?
- Earth, actually.
- Oh.
Been a while.
Here's the return clicker.
No need.
One-way trip.
Wow.
Okay.
Good luck.
Thank you.
I have something for you.
Yeah?
- He's real!
-  It's real!
He's a real frog!
- Yes, it sure is.
-  Thank you.
And you know what?
I got the perfect name for him.
Mr. Jumpy Legs.
Oh.
I thought you were gonna Never mind.
Hello, Mr. Jumpy Legs!
Okay.
So, here's your driver's license and your Social Security card.
I set up a bank account for you.
There's enough money in there so that you don't starve, but not so much that you become an entitled jerk.
Thank you, Janet.
Make a doctor's appointment as soon as you get down there.
And no salty food.
You have to keep your blood pressure down.
You have blood now.
I'll be fine.
I'll be okay.
I know.
I just worry.
I'll see you again, you know.
I'll see you when I get back.
Okay.
If you rent a car, don't pay for the insurance.
It's a scam.
Okay.
Man, it's hot.
But it's a it's a dry heat.
So, as I mentioned before, you can sit on this bench as long as you want, and whenever you're ready, you just walk through.
Care to join me for a bit?
Margarita?
Always.
-  - Mmm.
Okay, top three moments of your not-life with us.
Go.
You telling us that we should try to help other people on Earth, the moment that we all got into the Good Place for real, and then it's an 8-million-way tie of every time Jason and I kissed.
- He was a really good kisser.
- I bet he was.
I wonder how Michael's doing.
I assume he's doing the same as every human.
-  Three, two, one - Some good days.
Happy New Year!
Some bad days.
She's gonna be okay.
This city has really good hospitals.
He's got a few friends.
Such a good boy, Jason.
Such a good boy.
A few people he can't stand.
He's learning some things - all by himself.
- Oh, geez, ow!
And hopefully learning to ask for help when he needs it.
Guitar like this.
Fingers this way.
You have no idea how long I've been trying to figure that out.
Well, everybody needs a teacher.
So do it again.
He's messing up, and trying again, and messing up again, and then getting things wrong, and then trying to make them right.
That's what everyone does.
- To Michael.
- To Michael.
What do you think happens when people walk through the door?
It's the only thing in the universe I don't know.
I don't know either.
The wave returns to the ocean.
What the ocean does with the water after that is anyone's guess.
But as a very wise not-robot once told me, true joy is in the mystery.
Do you mind if I stay here until you're gone?
Only if you say that thing I taught you.
I hate to see you walk through the final door at the edge of existence, - but I love to watch you leave.
- There we go.
Hey, this was delivered to my building by mistake.
- I think it's yours.
- Oh, hey.
- Thanks so much.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, wow.
I think I know what this is.
Oh.
Oh, my.
- - Oh, my.
Look at that.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so very, very much.
Yeah, no problem.
Take it easy.
I'll do you one better.
I'll say this to you, my friend, with all the love in my heart and all the wisdom of the universe.
Take it sleazy.
All right.
