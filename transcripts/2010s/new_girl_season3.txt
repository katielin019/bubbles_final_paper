{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on New Girl We're at a wedding together.
Guys, guys, shut and listen to me it's Cece.
She doesn't want to get married.
I'm sorry, everyone, but I can't do this.
What I want is to be with someone else.
Are you in love with her or are you in love with me?
You have to decide.
We tried.
We had one night.
Okay, what happened with Jess?
We called it.
Yeah, when things get messy you just run away.
I know you think we should call it.
But I don't want to give up on this.
You know what?
I gotta say, Jess, I really like you.
- I really, really like you.
- I really like you.
I can't believe this is happening.
- It's crazy, but it's happening.
- It's crazy.
I like you so much.
- Yeah, I like you so much.
- Like - Yeah.
- I'm just - What?
- I'm in.
You know?
I'm - I'm just all in.
- I'm all in.
I'm, like, weirdly all in.
- Hey, Nick - What?
Pull over.
Well, that was fun.
We finally broke in the Volvo.
Oh, my.
What's next?
What do we do now?
I'm really fighting the urge to buy you a lobster dinner.
Do we just go home?
You know, I mean, just how is it actually gonna work?
We've only been dating for 30 minutes and we're already living together.
What if you get tired of me, and you have nowhere to go because we're roommates, and so you have to sleep in your car Hey.
Stop.
That's not gonna happen.
I've wanted this for so long.
I don't want anything to go wrong.
Oh, it's Schmidt.
He's freaking out about Cece.
He doesn't need to reach you all the time.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm gonna ignore it for now.
It's all about us right now.
Hmm.
It's Schmidt.
He wants to know where you are.
He texted you to ask where I am?
That's ugh.
He just texted I'm a bad friend.
You know what that is?
Either male genitalia, or a really big thumbs down.
- Why would he send me male genitalia?
- Why can't he talk to Winston?
Well, without me, they get so weird and they fight all the time.
This is what I'm talk How many times a day does Schmidt text you?
I don't know, I'll just say 40.
How See, this is what I'm talking about.
I feel like we need time alone so we can figure out what this is.
Yes.
This is what I want.
I want to be with you alone, without anybody else.
Just you and Where have you been?
I'm having a major life crisis, and you guys are, what?
Just driving around, French-kissing each other like a couple Dutch hookers?
What is that, Nick?
Is that a hickey?
- Disgusting!
- Hey, you guys.
Um, I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Now, I know everyone's going through a lot, but I think it is time for me to start a puzzle.
No, it isn't.
What is going on with you two?
Are you, like, a couple now?
Have you thought any of this through?
Nick, please help me, okay?
Stop being so selfish and just help me.
Okay, you know what?
Give me one minute, - I'll be right inside.
- We'll be right in.
Yeah, we just got to figure something out.
All right!
Thanks, man.
- The gang's back.
- We'll be right in.
Yeah, good-bye, guys.
We love you guys.
- Run!
- Run!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Well, Winston, after 25 unanswered text messages to Nick and Jess this morning, I finally received a response.
A smiley face.
This leaves us with one choice - To become best friends.
- Huh?
Yeah, fine.
For r?
Okay, great.
Now, as my best friend, I expect you to be willing to sacrifice everything for me at a moment's notice, including, of course, unfortunately for you, your dignity.
- Yeah, fine.
- Winston, what can I do for you?
Don't talk to me that much, never lie to me, and never, ever touch my puzzle.
Winston, do we do we think now is really the right time to be starting a puzzle?
I'm great at puzzles.
You're a born puzzler, Winston, sure, um, but don't you agree that sometimes, when you start puzzles, you get a little bit weird?
And, I don't know, intense?
Spend a lot of time humming.
Also spend a lot of time naked.
I'm gonna do you, puzzle!
Right on the table.
As nasty as you want to be.
Hey, Schmidt, what do you think it's gonna look like?
What do I think it's going to look like?
- Yeah, the puzzle.
- Winston, it's on the box.
The the picture's on the box.
It's a Japanese garden!
Schmidt, calm down.
What is your problem?
Two women are in love with me.
The problem is, is I'm in love with both of them.
Okay, looks like you're gonna have to choose.
Cece and I, we have this connection.
You know, it's physical it's unhealthy.
Look, I don't want to get too graphic with you, but I'm not just the plug with her.
I'm also a socket.
God okay, fine.
- Schmidt, choose Cece.
- Yeah, but - I was dating Elizabeth first, so - Mm-hmm.
Wait a minute Winston I was dating Elizabeth first.
- You want to know what I think?
- No, I don't.
Done.
Decided.
Ha!
Cece, out.
I was dating Elizabeth first.
- My man!
Way to talk that out.
- Yeah.
- Best friends.
- Best friends.
This is gonna work out, man.
Yeah, it's gonna work out, man.
Puzzling Winston is about to do some puzzling About to get into some puzzle troubling So, in conclusion, it's a you know, it's a very difficult decision that I've had to that, you know, that you guys have put me in, here, but I just I'm gonna be candid.
I've been up for 24 hours.
I have to return all of these gifts.
So just say it.
You don't want to be with me.
Wh huh?
Look look at that.
I just looked down and I thought, "This girl must be wearing sneakers "with shoelaces, and th-those shoelaces must be tied together, because this girl is straight trippin', yo".
- What?
- Of course I want to be with you.
But I feel so terrible for Elizabeth.
How did she take it?
Sh She took it.
In the marketplace of ideas, where culture is king, and data moves faster than people, where scalable opportunities come from turnkey solutions What are you trying to say, Schmidt?
Is it over?
No no.
As if.
Of course I picked you.
It wasn't even close.
Come here, you crazy white girl.
There it is.
Poor Cece.
Uh, yeah, okay.
Oh I fell asleep.
How long have you been driving?
Those cops look like they're about 15 and they have huge guns.
Jess, are we in Mexico?
All in!
We're in Mexico!
Oh, my God, pull over!
That piÃ±ata's shaped like a monkey!
You know what?
It's gonna be weird going back to having sex without a bunch of feral dogs watching.
Why am I not hungry?
I should be hungry.
Remember when we lived in that loft, and, like, we had all those problems?
Yeah.
All in!
Voice mail?
Again?
Where have you been?
It's been four days, man.
Have you really been doing it with Jess this whole time?
That's disgusting.
Nick, I did something really wrong, and, uh I just I need to talk to you.
I need to talk to my friend.
Come home.
Yeah, I should try him again.
Dial best friend one.
- Let's stay here.
- We're totally out of money.
- We got this great setup.
- No, this is not gonna last long.
It's not gonna last long.
It isn't.
This is a badly built shelter.
We'll go right there.
How hard could that place be to sneak into?
You all in?
Nick, this has been fun, but Okay, look, everything that's bad is waiting for us back in the loft.
But here?
I'm Paradise Nick.
And Paradise Nick is mega-chill.
And you're Paradise Jess, right?
We can make food and just - All in.
- All in.
It don't work like that.
If you uh Hey, man, how'd she take it?
Devastated.
I'm sure glad that's settled.
Hey, man, I'm gonna go shower.
I'm proud of you.
I know it must have been tough.
Hey, Schmidt, who do you call if puzzle pieces are broken?
Oh.
Hey, Winston.
Is, uh, is Schmidt home?
Cece.
Oh, my goodness.
Hi.
Do you need a hug?
All right.
Is Schmidt even here, Winston?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's in the shower.
Um Cece, I just want to say, on my end, that I am so, so sorry.
Sorry about what?
You know, uh Elizabeth.
Well, what about Elizabeth?
He made love to her.
Winston made love to Elizabeth.
After I chose you, Winston was all too quick, in Elizabeth's vulnerable state, to rush in there and just get his jollies off.
His sweaty, disgusting jollies.
Seriously?
I mean, she must have just been so upset and hurt I didn't even know you were interested in her.
Tell her what you did, Winston, and give her the short version, which you did not give to Elizabeth.
Wha?
What I did um Okay, well, I drove over there to seduce her.
And I seduced her two and a half times.
Puzzle me this, then, Winston How do you live with yourself?
I have a bit of a hard time believing that Winston would do this.
Well, then, you obviously don't know Winston, 'cause he's a sick, disgusting human being.
Just this morning he asked me for a pair of your underpants.
- Winston?
- Hmm?
Is that true?
Yes.
I needed your underwear to sew into my underwear.
Oh my God.
That is disgusting!
You are a pervert!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Cece.
Just wait in the car.
You don't have to deal with this disgusting trash person, garbage child!
You're upset.
As you should be.
Oh, but that was great, man.
How long as this been going on, man?
Four days.
Four days, and you didn't tell me?
Come on, Schmidt!
I said, "Don't lie to me".
I'm sorry.
All right?
I love both of these women and I couldn't decide.
I needed to buy some more time.
Cece thinks I'm wearing her panties right now!
Well, that's on you, man!
You freaked out super hard!
You-you kidding me?
That's so weird.
Sewing people's panties into underpants.
Look, we're not best friends, Schmidt.
As a matter of fact, we're not friends at all until you fix this.
Okay, all right, look.
Winston, I'm sorry, man.
W-Winston, you've been working on this puzzle for quite some time now.
You realize a lot of those puzzle pieces are upside down, right?
It's just they're cardboard color.
Is that an almond that you have inserted into one of the pieces?
Are you just eating them, or are you using them as pieces?
You know that's an almond, right?
Schmidt, come here!
Free cocktails.
- No way!
- Yeah, fitting right in.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
Security guard.
Freeze.
Okay, don't freeze.
That looks weird.
Did he notice you?
Of course he noticed you.
You're the prettiest girl on the damn beach.
Shut up.
We need one of these bracelets right away, Jess.
- Bracelet.
- Yeah.
Oh, hey!
Hey Hey, pal.
That's a really cool bracelet.
Do you think I could try it on?
- No.
- Listen to me, okay?
Will you lean in here for a second and listen to me?
One day, you're gonna meet a girl, you're gonna really like her, and you're gonna want to give her everything, but you won't be able to afford it because your life's kind of in shambles and you don't have money.
Look at you, kid, you got a great-looking face.
I don't know, you might have a tough go of it.
What do I know?
Just promise me this Promise me you're gonna try to enjoy your life as much as you can, 'cause one day you're gonna be dead, and, you know.
Can I have your bracelet, for real?
No.
If you don't give me the bracelet, I'm gonna strangle you to death.
- Thanks, buddy.
- Not cool.
But it worked, okay?
We got the bracelet, so now we're back in action.

Can I see your bracelets, por favor?
Yes.
Looks pretty on her, right?
SeÃ±or?

I've got a shell.
Let's just go.
Let's just get out of here.

Truce, okay?
Winston, please, come on Talk to me.
I I need a friend right now.
I love both of these women, and I can't lose them, and I can't hurt them.
And we made a pact!
No.
You lied to me.
You're a liar.
Okay, well, then would you like some truth, Winston?
Here's some truth for you, okay?
You're terrible at puzzles.
Worst I've ever seen by a mile.
What, do you have fly vision?
Look at this puzzle.
It's ages six and up.
You are up, Winston.
- You are way up!
- You want to say that to my face?
This is a corner piece, Winston!
How do you not see that?
What are you, blind?
!
I'm so sorry actually, a blind man could feel the smooth edges of a corner piece!
You are making me so mad.
- Ooh, you are making me so mad.
- Oh, yeah?
You're making me How am I making you?
Am I making you?
- Yes, you're making me mad.
- What you want to do?
What are you doing?
Which way are you going?
What is happening?
- Ow!
- What did you do?
Don't mess with me, man.
I'm legit.
I'm legit, dude.
- I'm getting very dizzy.
- You coming at me, son?
I need all the cash you have and Nick's passport!
- What'd you say?
What?
- Nick's in trouble?
What are we doing?
Nick is in jail?
Nick went to jail before me?
Hey, stop it!
Stop it!
This is not the time for fighting.
Nick is in a Mexican jail.
We don't know this country.
We don't know their laws.
We don't know how to get him out.
I just hope he found somebody who can protect him and take care of him.
What, you hope he's somebody's bitch?
- No, like a mentor.
- He'd never be picked as a bitch.
Nick is very attractive.
He can be a bitch.
A sissy, perhaps, but a bitch?
- He can be a bitch.
- He cannot be a bitch.
- My God, what's a sissy?
- Are you insane?
- A chubby gringo?
- Stop it!
Nick is my bitch.
Hola, seÃ±ores, seÃ±ora.
Hi.
Um, we have some questions.
Jess, I got this.
I know how to handle these people.
Is this for me?
That's for you to send your kids to college, or for you to send some fun up your nose.
Your choice, bro.
Don't worry.
We're looking for our friend Nick Miller if he's still alive, and his head if it's separate.
You know who you should talk to?
Manny.
- Manny.
- Manny.
Talk to Julio.
- Julio.
- Julio.
Talk to Brad.
I don't really feel right about this.
Oh, Jess, you're so naive.
It's a game.
We're working our way up the ladder.
Brad is clearly the kingpin.
Thanks so much.
Okay, that didn't work.
Next idea.
Well There are no next ideas, Schmidt!
We're out of money!
I need to just find somebody.
- Oh, just find somebody?
- Yes.
Right, Jess, 'cause the streets down here - they run red with hospitality.
- Hey!
Hey!
Hi.
Sorry.
I met you yesterday.
You arrested a man named Nick Miller.
You got money?
Money.
No, we don't have any money.
But wait, wait, wait!
What about his shoes?
Any interest in his shoes?
There's no way you're getting these damn shoes, okay?
These are my favorite brown shoes.
And besides, this is all your fault, Schmidt.
Nick's body's being traded like cigarettes right now!
Winston, those shoes are not brown they're green.
- What the hell you talking about, man?
- Those shoes are green.
You guys are idiots, all right?
They're as brown as money.
- What color is Kermit the Frog?
- Brown.
It's a brown frog.
Winston, you're color-blind, dude.
What?
I am not color I am not color-blind.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
Sir, I'm so sorry.
We have no money.
We don't even have money for gas.
Oh, you got a car.
Want to trade?
Hey.
Oh, my God, I thought he was taking you to jail.
No, it's resort jail, and it's not so bad.
They let me watch Ugly Betty.
Here, I brought you your passport.
- Winston, enough!
- Enough for me!
Oh, Nicholas, thank goodness you're alive.
You brought them?
I needed their help.
- Winston does not get me at all.
- What?
And, plus, he's color-blind, which basically makes him crippled.
Please, tell me these shoes are brown, right?
- Those shoes are green.
- They're definitely green.
Okay, you both are crazy.
Winston!
If you think those shoes are brown, what color do you think you are?
Jess, I can't do this.
Do you really want to wake up to this every morning?
It doesn't matter, as long as I wake up next to you.
I got an idea.
Let's move to Mexico.
- What?
- Yeah!
- Hell no!
- Nicolas, I need you.
If you leave, then I'm with Winston, and I can't handle that.
You and me, we work here.
If we go back to the loft, we're not gonna make it.
Yes, we are.
We are gonna make it.
You won't.
He's 100% right.
You will not.
I'm not ready to lose you.
I just got you, Jess.
And I'm not letting you go.
So I'm all in.
I'm shredding this passport.
I'm not leaving Mexico.
- Oh, no, you are not, sir!
- No, no, no, wait, wait!
I will put myself in that shredder before you put your passport in there!
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, switch!
- Put yourself in there.
- Stop!
Stop, Nick!
I will shred my ear!
I'll do it!
- Your ear could go in!
- I will shred myself!
I will shred myself in the shredder.
Get serious!
Stop.
Listen to me.
We're a family.
You can't choose who you love.
Sometimes they choose you.
And sometimes, it's just because you got a really great deal on Craigslist.
I got a really great deal on Craigslist.
I got all of you.
There is no "us" without Schmidt and Winston.
It's gonna be really, really hard.
But so what, Nick?
So what?
I believe in us.
I'm all in.
I really want to go home.
Come on, man, let's just go home.
You know what?
I love you guys.
- Okay.
- Let's go home.
Great.
Oh, my God!
No!
Get it out!
Get it out!
Unplug it, Nick!
The shredder shredded it, bro.

I can work with this.
Okay, everybody.
Just be cool.
Act normal.

I think I can make that work.
Uh, can you give me, like, five minutes?
Great.
Um ooh, actually, could you hold on one second?

This is the first time.
It's not bad.
- I mean, it's not great.
- Yeah, I agree.
Somewhere right in the middle.
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Of course.
Hypothetically speaking, what if you met somebody that you that you liked, uh, just as much as Jess?
Schmidt, stop.
Okay, you picked Cece, so let Elizabeth go.
Initially I said "hypothetically," so just Do you know a place I can get cheap school supplies?
I only have $15 and a halfie $15 and a halfie.
- A halfie?
- Yeah, it's a half.
It got ripped, so it's a half.

- I thought you pressed the button!
What is wrong with you?
!
- What did you do when you walked in?
- Talked to you.
Guys, I'm gonna go pick up Daisy's cat.
You know, you don't just ask anybody to take care of your cat.
That's a very serious thing, so I decided I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna ask Daisy to be my girlfriend.
- You are?
- Whoa!
- Yeah.
- Major move!
- Good stuff.
- Look at you, man.
So I'm just gonna go over there and I'm gonna tell Daisy, "Listen, my heart is a two-man bike, and I want you in the rear".
What do you think?
Winston, don't say that.
You want her in your?
You can say "the rear".
You don't want her in your rear.
No, don't say "the rear" at any time.
- You guys are just jealous.
- What?
You guys are gonna steal my swag.
I wouldn't even know how to begin to steal a swag.
- I thought you pressed the button.
- I've been way over here.
- I-I haven't pressed - I'll press the button.

My tiny credenza is in the way.
Hey, Elizabeth, are you gonna be coming to the party tomorrow night?

How how dare you interfere with my personal life, you crone.
I don't I don't kick up a fuss when you massage yourself with your yoga ball.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you gonna invite Cece?
Beth, please.
I am in love with both of these women.
Do I feel bad about lying to them?
Yes.
I'm a Sagittarius.
Congrats on your new office.
Gina gave birth on that carpet.
Consider this closed.
Right, so, yeah, um Um, so, Daisy, what I was really trying to say is, uh Is your shower running?
Yeah, I was just about to take a shower.
- What's going on?
- Okay.
Um, Daisy, I think what we have is real, and, uh, I want us to be exclusive just you and me in the rear.
Yeah, that sounds great.
Awesome, um Sorry, that's mine.
So, Furguson gets his wet food in the morning, dry food at night.
Somebody in there?
No.
No treats after midnight.
"Oh, my name is Principal Foster, and this is the Jacooz".
"The Jacooz".
He's so nice, don't you think?
He's such a nice boss.
Y'all want some drinks?
- Yeah, okay.
- Yep.
- Yeah.
Thank, thank you.
- Thank you.
What do you think?
I think it's going really well.
Okay, I just realized what's happening.
It's high school over there, and they're the cool kids, and you're the nerd.
I was never a nerd.
On western wings the fowls doth fly On briny swells the fishes doth swim Oh, like you were so cool.
Stall!
CROWD Nick!
Nick!
Nick!
The Miller Sack Pack.
- Miller Sack Pack?
- They made shirts.
You know what?
I'm not explaining my coolness to you.
I was cool.
Listen to me.
You want to be in with them?
Roll with the punches, go with the flow.
Make fun of your boss a little bit.
Don't follow your instincts.
I wouldn't sing.
But most importantly, follow my lead.
And by "follow my lead," I mean drink.
And I mean drink a lot.
Drinking to be cool, Nick?
That's not a real thing.
That's the only thing in the world I know to be true.
Schools are for fools!
They are.
Sometimes firemen are women!
Sometimes!
Sometimes!
Hey, there she is.
Ol' Toilet Pants, the girl who bet herself six dollars she could dance in a toilet bowl.
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah What's going on?
I'm cool.
You are cool, but you still got to go to work, 'cause you're running late, so up and at 'em.
Hey, Nick, I got to talk to you.
I have a real problem.
- Oh, my God.
Did you kill Jess?
- No, no, no, no.
She just got really drunk last night, and she passed out.
Hey, guys.
- Are you crying, buddy?
- No.
Hey, did he kill Jess?
No, I didn't kill Je Okay, remember when I was so hungover, I almost missed my flight for Christmas?
Ah, count it down.
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.
I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day Spread my wings and fly away I believe I can soar Soar - I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.
- Oh, she's awake.
That was beautiful.
Where are my tights?
Uh, in the bathroom where you barfed.
You sounded really good there, man.
- Start the band.
- What did you do to her?
I just told her that I thought drinking would make her cool.
What are you, a 14-year-old hockey player?
You're supposed to protect her, not encourage her.
Okay, I am protecting her.
She's my old lady now.
- By turning her into you?
- I'm not Yeah, Daisy cheating on me.
Wait, we're using real honey?
So sticky.
Hey, babe!
What a nice surprise!
I came to tell you that you can't come with me to the party tonight.
They just told me that it's employees only.
No sig oths.
Just say "significant others".
Maybe you have that kind of time, but I'm on a tight sched.
Looks like we're gonna go late here anyway, so no worries.
All right Shorty.
All right, bring in the bees!
Oh, wait.
The bees are real, too?
Oh, hell no!
Nick, I need your help, okay?
Now, I am no plumber, but I'm 99% sure that there was a guy in her bathroom.
So, she agreed to be exclusive with you while the guy she is obviously sleeping with was washing his size 15 ding-dong in the shower.
And now you're taking care of her cat.
Those are the bullet points, yes.
You know what you got to do to get yourself out of this situation.
Break up with Daisy!
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, you're making some very good points.
You know, break up with Daisy.
That's an option.
I was thinking, like, I'll kill her cat.
Winston.
Yeah, I'm-I'm gonna kill her cat first.
- Hey.
- I'm gonna kill you.
Hey, it's little Toilet Pants.
Hey, Toilet Pants!
Toilet Pants!
Please stop shouting.
You are so awesome.
I want to show you something.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
You're one of us now.
You never have to drink out of a paper cup again.
Fun mugs.
This one makes me look like I have a - mustache.
- Mustache.
Mustache.
- What's up, Winston?
- Oh, hey, Nick.
You know, I couldn't figure out the best way to kill Furguson, so I decided to just let him choose how he wants to die.
If only I could get him to leave that damn sunbeam.
- You're gonna murder a cat?
- Yeah.
- This is a joke, right?
- No.
- This is one of your pranks?
- An eye for an eye, Nick.
A cat for a cat.
But what's the other cat?
My heart.
Where's that big flashlight you can hit people with?
Also, do we have any meat pieces that might distract a dog?
Winston, don't do anything stupid.
- Jess, what are you doing?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Cool, cool.
It's nothing.
We're just breaking into Foster's backyard, and we are gonna put our butts in his Jacuzzi.
You're gonna put your butts in his Jacuzzi?
- Isn't it awesome?
- Uh, no, it's not awesome.
It's a crime.
It's a very stupid crime, but it's a crime.
Hey, do you have any makeup or costumes that might make someone look like a bush?
You are about to commit a felony.
Oh, my God, Nick!
You said roll with it!
You're not the kind of person who could break into the principal's house and get away with it.
You're the kind of person who gets caught, and it ends up on the Internet in a funny way.
My God!
That is the cutest cat!
Uh, don't get attached.
Okay, both of you, knock it off!
Winston!
Look, Nick, you're right.
I'm a nerd.
I've never fit in.
If I met you in high school, you never would have even noticed me.
That's just because I didn't go to class.
- I wouldn't have seen you.
- I know it's stupid, but I'm doing it.
- I'm not letting you go.
- Oh, you're not letting me?
No.
If for some reason I don't come back tonight, I'll be at the Appleton Suites under the name Suzuki Sinclair.
- Ask for Charles.
- Don't Hey, hey.
We're not done with this conversation, young lady!
- Well, we are done!
- Oh, yeah, then where are you going?
!
- I'm getting a flashlight!
- Oh, a hammer, huh?
- Hey, Winston, Winston.
- Good way to go.
Thr - Don't hurt that cat.
- Uh-huh.
- Hey, Furguson?
Furguson?
- You scared him.
Don't do this.
- Furguson?
- Winston!
Winston, Winston, stop what you Stop!
Don't do that scary walk!
Do not do that scary walk that you do that scares me!
Hey, Jess?
Jess?
Je?
Winston, don't kill that!
Jess!
I don't know what to do!
- Oh, good Lord.
- What's wrong?
Nothing.
You know what?
Let me show you the stairwell where they got the idea for the escalator.
Shorty!
My love.
My only love.
I'm sorry.
I just I quit that job, and I had to see you.
How emotional.
Let's go talk about it in private in a perfect two-thirds replica of Don Draper's office.
You stay here.
I'm gonna get you a drink.
No, no, no, please, you-you you stay here.
- So - Oh, God, what?
They're both here.
The gas has been spilled.
All we need is a match.
What, are you narrating a book?
Here it comes.
The long nap.
Oh, wow.
Tell you what, man, we both need to just cool off and have a drink.
You smoke?
I'm just kidding.
But, man, that'd be cute if you did.
What is wrong with me?
It Oh, Furguson.
So, listen, I've been dreaming about this fantasy, and I think this party might be the perfect place to try it out.
Okay, but I can't get wet.
No water.
So, listen, you and I are gonna be sexy strangers.
Yeah?
Now, your stranger is the early-to-bed type, and your job has you on Hong Kong time.
But the most important thing is, you're the first person to leave the party.
Whew.
I like.
- Wait, is that Cece?
- Is that who?
Huh?
No.
- Cece.
No.
- No, Schmidt, that's definitely Cece.
Sorry, in between modeling jobs, she does catering.
You mind if I go over there and say hello?
I think it's only right.
Eh.
- Hey.
- Hey, I know you told me to stay in the office, but Beth insisted that I Stay away from that woman.
She is patient zero in this office for spreading HPV.
Here.
Put on this apron.
No, why-why would I do that?
That's crazy.
My boss was asking, so I told her you were a caterer.
So just It's a good idea.
- Okay.
- Just Yes.
You really want me here, don't you?
So badly.
Can we just come back when we have a plan?
Are you afraid?
No, I'm not afraid.
Rose, give me a boost.
Here's Rose.
I got you.
Oh, my Oh, my God.
You got to help me a little.
That's a hell of a grip, Rose.
I see the Jacuzzi!
Didn't stick the landing!
You're doing great.
I'm gonna do a loop to not attract suspicion.
- All right.
- All right.
Schmidt.
I'm right here.
Oh.
Do I know you?
Right.
The fantasy.
Boy, I got to go.
I have a 5:00 a.m. conference call with the Asians.
Are you leaving soon, stranger?
You mean "Corporal"?
And, no, I'm gonna stick around and throw down one more beer.
Sweet.
Oh, hey.
Don't tell me you're leaving.
Whew, great news.
My boss is in her office completely passed out.
- We finally have the night to ourselves.
- Thank God.
It's getting a little weird here, right?
Dressed up like this.
That Elizabeth?
Okay, look, Cece, I-I got to tell you something.
Does Elizabeth work here?
Yes.
Hey.
We were just talking about you.
The food was good.
Yeah.
I was thinking of taking some home.
You deserve it.
Okay, well, I'm heading off.
The Asian markets wait for no one.
Wow.
She was ice cold to you.
I'm gonna go get a drink.
What a night.
- I got this!
- Open the damn gate!
- Everything's under control!
- Jess, hey!
Don't move!
I'm coming over!
Rose, move!
Jess, hey.
I'm coming.
- I got you.
- Whoa, hey, Rose!
Ease up on the throttle.
Those are my precious goods.
Did you follow me here?
Here I come!
- Nick.
- Hey.
Hey, Jess.
Jess, hey.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry I tried to stick my nose in this.
I just I just I came here because I'm your old man now.
And if you're gonna do something that's obviously very stupid then I'm gonna do it with you.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
- You go there.
- Ow.
- What's going on out here?
- Hey.
- Who are you?
- No, I-I used to live here.
I was just doing a visit around the neighborhood.
That's my old bedroom right there.
That's a bathroom.
To you maybe it is.
But to me and my four brothers, - that's a home.
- Nick.
Nick, I can't let you do this.
Mostly 'cause you're so bad at it.
- Is that you, Ms. Day?
- Yes.
It is.
I'm so sorry.
I trespassed on your property.
And I would not be surprised if you fired me.
I think I know what's really going on here.
You heard about my new Jacooz.
And you wanted a taste.
And say a little prayer for right You know that if we are to stay alive Come on in, kids.
The water's hot!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo Doo-doo-doo Hey, babe.
Thanks for watching him.
He can be a real pain in the ass, huh?
Yeah Was there a dude in your shower yesterday?
Yes.
Hmm.
How do you know him?
From sex.
But it was from sex before you and I were exclusive.
Have you had sex with him since?
No.
Oh, wait.
Yes.
Last night.
Look, um I really liked you, Daisy.
You know, I wanted this to be a thing, but, uh I deserve better.
And so does Furguson.
Hmm?
I'm keeping the cat.
I got your cat!
Well, Schmidt, you win.
They both really love you.
So enjoy your office.
- Hey!
Toilet Pants!
- Oh!
Toilet Pants!
Thanks for taking the bullet for us the other night.
How long were you stuck in that Jacuzzi for?
I don't really want to talk about it, but, um, at one point, he did grab my foot with his toes like it was a hand.
What are you doing tonight?
'Cause we got a liquid form of Ecstasy, and we're gonna grade papers together.
What?
I would love to, but I actually think I'm gonna hang out with my old man.
That's weird.
Cool.
- See you.
- Weirdo.
Hi.
So I hear you're interested in joining the Sack Pack.
I might be.
Then perhaps this will wet your whistle of what's fun about being a member.
- Just leave it.
- Yeah.
You are terrible at Hacky Sack.
I think I'm retiring.
Yeah, I just want to say I would've noticed you.
Want to go do it in the teachers' lounge?
- Yes.
- You do?
Oh, I'm gonna do it with a teacher!
Shh.
Okay, something is definitely coming out.
I think we should go.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hey, Elizabeth, what are we doing tonight?
Dexter and pie.
Girl, you treat me right.
Hey, there she is, my one and only.
Oh, thank God, coffee.
- I barely slept last night.
- Yeah, me, too.
I think I passed out for, like, 25 minutes when you jammed that sock down my throat.
- I aim to please.
- Aw Hey, why don't we all go on a double date?
What are you guys doing tonight?
Yeah.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
- Today's tonight?
- Yeah.
Tonight meaning changes every day, doesn't it?
Come on, Schmidt.
I'm sure he's got other plans.
You've got other plans, right?
Plans?
Not me.
I don't even I mean Yeah!
What the hell is going on?
What?
Double-double-double-double date!
Rock, rock and roll.
I don't think I exactly understand the energy here, but yeah, I mean, it sounds great.
Hey, you want to split that pasta from last night, hmm?
Winston and Furguson 'bout to split some pasta.
Yeah, man, you know I got "wuv" for you.
Got nothing but love for you.
Go ahead, chill out, man, I'll make you some coffee.
What?
So what are y'all talking about, going on dates?
Oh, y'all are talking about that.
Okay, cool.
Nobody invited me.
Is it 'cause I'm single?
I mean, I I know I'm single.
I'm okay with it.
It was a choice that I made as a man to be alone.
Don't nobody know you like you, so I'm I'm choosing to know myself, who I am.
And if that's okay with you all, can I come?
All right, where should we go tonight, you guys?
What about that new spot Picca?
A day-of rezzie at Picca?
You guys don't think I can do it, huh?
Well, funk that.
Bishop can get a table at a chair store.
Well, that's it, then.
Double date plus one!
You know what would be nuts?
If I brought my cat Furguson as a date.
Ah, don't do that.
Hey, listen.
What is that sound?
Sounds like a gravel driveway in there.
Seventh grade.
Pumping my fist too hard at a Weird Al show.
Go away!
Hey, Jess, can you talk?
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, totally.
How'd I get so lucky?
My bro and my ho.
My penis it's gonna be exposed.
It's okay, just cover up.
Okay, no, but I don't feel comfortable.
- It's about Schmidt.
- Okay, I'm not involved in this at all.
Hiding from the world.
You can't see me, I can't see you.
I know this sounds totally paranoid, but I think he's on drugs.
Schmidt on drugs?
Okay, not getting involved starting now.
I'm with Nick here.
You remember how hard he took it when Lance got busted.
He just stared at that yellow bracelet and cried.
I know you're right, but - You're coming in?
- It's just like he's had this crazy energy lately.
And did you see how insane he was when we were talking about the double date?
Also, he has just, like, stopped blinking.
- Is that whippits?
- Well, Nick can talk to him.
No, I'm not gonna talk to him.
I called that I wasn't gonna be involved; those calls have to be respected.
If you talk to him, I'll give you a treat.
Bedroom treat or kitchen treat?
Oh, I'm just a country lawyer and I have a very, very itchy bra.
Well, perhaps I can get underneath.
I've got worker's hands.
It's very itchy in so many different little places.
Let me see.
You guys are being really, really gross right now.
I keep forgetting you're in here.
I think you made a really good point.
Maybe he is just, like, really into me.
I mean, he has, like, stepped up his bed game a lot.
It is so not about him anymore.
That's disgusting.
Let me know when that treat's gonna happen.
And, Cece, I'm sorry about this, but I'm gonna stand up and you're gonna see my penis, and when I walk out, you're gonna see my butt.
Let's do this.
Oh.
Ah, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
Sorry.
Yeah, so that's glass.
That ain't no mint.
Nope.
Definitely glass, and I swallowed that, so you should consider, uh, a sign.
- Do you have a reservation?
- You know, it's funny that you would ask that because, you know, I tried to call, like, but, uh, I'm looking for a reservation for tonight around 8:00 p.m. Let's say, like, five people.
I have an 8:30.
Ah, kind of had our heart set on 8:00.
Seven weeks from now.
Wait, what, what?
No, n-n-n-n-no.
Look, there's got to be something that you can do.
Well, you could try your luck at the community table.
Community hell, no.
Listen, um, sorry, you don't understand.
This has to be an official reservation.
No.
I'll tell you what, maybe this will change your mind.
"I owe you a hundred dollars".
Oh, hell no.
No, that that was supposed to be a ten.
Whoa, you got there faster than I thought.
Hey, so this is weird and it's only gonna take a second of your time, but, uh and I probably already know the answer, but are you on drugs?
I know the answer is no, so I'll just see you later, man.
- Get in my room.
- Don't want to be part of it!
Did you crack my e-mail password?
How did you guess "Smithereens"?
Are you really on drugs?
Talk to me, Schmidt.
I'm in way over my head, Nick, I'm doing something terrible.
Well, what is it, man?
You're going to get mad at me.
I'm your best friend.
Okay, I was there for you when you fell off the deck at Chester's graduation.
Oh, no.
And I'm here for you now.
There's nothing you could say that I'd get mad at.
O okay, um, I can do this.
Do you know how I broke up with Elizabeth so that I could start dating Cece again?
Absolutely, and it was really hard for you.
Yeah, that actually never happened.
What do you mean?
I'm still dating Elizabeth.
What do you mean?
I'm dating both of them, and neither one of them knows it, and I feel terrible about it.
But Elizabeth is gone.
- What do you mean?
- She's not gone.
- So you broke up with Cece - I didn't break up with either one of them.
What do you mean?
You process this however you need to process it.
If you want to keep talking it out - Which one are you dating?
- Both.
- Are you dating Cece?
- I'm dating Cece.
- Are you dating Elizabeth?
- Yes.
- How do you do that?
- They made me choose.
You have to choose.
You can't have both women.
What was I supposed to do?
What, you think you can have a bunch of wives?
!
You got one wife!
This is the way the world works!
- Why?
!
- I don't know.
I feel terrible about this, I don't know what to do.
How could you do this with Jess's best friend?
I don't know, I feel really badly about it!
In your little brain, how do you see this ending?
I see it ending badly.
I see it ending very, very badly.
But you know what?
I just I want to thank you, though, just for being there for me and for listening to me.
No.
I'm not listening to you and I'm not there for you.
- Because now we're in this together.
- We're not in this together and I'm not listening and I'm not being there, so just stop telling me things!
What would you like me to do with this information?
Well, it really helped me to tell you.
- You should tell somebody, get it off your chest.
- I can't.
- You know what I mean?
- Like who?
Well, certainly not Jess.
- Don't ever tell Jess.
- The one person you can't tell is Jess.
Hello, Picca?
Yes, I need a table for five.
This is author Toni Morrison.
I am?
Well, oh, yeah?
Well, I think you're a woman!
Hello?
Okay, here's what it is.
Just lie to her, Nick.
It's a relationship men and women lie to each other all the time; it's what makes marriages work.
Just lie Oh, you can lie Yes, I talked to Schmidt.
Don't act like an alien; just lie to a woman.
It's Yeah, I talked to Schmidt.
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
Hey, Nick.
How was your day?
Nothing Why are you wearing a helmet?
Oh, hi.
Don't tease me, Nick.
Are we finally gonna do no-kiss sex?
Oh, yes.
Sorry about that.
Look at us.
Community table, like a little community.
Call that seat.
That's my seat.
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Oh, no, where are y'all going?
Dibs on those seats, dibs on that.
Put that for me right there.
Hey, put that right there for me.
That was amazing.
Jess, you know so many Spaceballs quotes.
They jam the radar with literal jam.
Oh, hey, did you ever talk to Schmidt?
What's going on, Nick?
Schmidt!
Hey!
My best friend?
!
You Long Island street trash!
Damn it, Nick, you told her?
No, he didn't tell me!
I I happened upon it.
Oh, you happened upon it?
Where, in the town square?
Jess, I never wanted to be involved in this.
You're so pretty.
Put your freakin' visor down.
Now, you you're gonna tell Cece or I will, you you crumb bum!
- Jess - You crumb bum.
Yes, well said.
- You are a lowlife.
- I I get it.
- How could you do this to her?
- Jess, I am so sorry.
I made up a dance so everyone will be happy.
Cece's gonna walk through that door any minute, and you have to tell her the truth.
Jess, please, this would wreck her.
I'm begging you.
I I know you don't believe me, but I do care about her.
Either you tell her or I will, Schmidt.
You're right.
I'll tell her.
Yo, what it be?
Double date night!
What's, uh, what's going on?
Tell her.
Tell her.
Okay, okay.
We're taking two cars.
It's faster that way because of gas.
- No phones.
- What?
Here you go; I got the door, it's okay.
Go!
Go!
Cigarette, phone call, bathroom.
Okay.
Sir, you're clearly alone.
We're gonna need this table.
Okay, so what do you think that over the past two hours, I, as a single person, have ordered eight separate entrees and have taken bites of different sizes of each of them to create some sort of pointless illusion?
Do you know how insane you sound?
God, I hate this job.
- You need to slow down.
- I got it.
Don't worry.
What's going on, man?
You guys were acting all so weird back there, - and you're driving like a maniac.
- Oh, geez.
You know, I didn't want to have to say anything, but What?
Here we go.
- Nick is cheating on Jess!
Aah!
- What?
!
Apparently, they met at some gas station.
She's much older.
Much, much older.
Deeply Korean.
I just found out.
And, I mean, Nick is my best friend and all, but I can't even be in the same room as that scumbag right now!
Oh, I'm so mad!
I'm just so, so mad!
I'm terribly angry about the whole situation.
I can't even drive.
Take the wheel.
Oh, why, God?
!
He was the best of us!
- Cece, please.
You're veering everywhere.
- Sorry.
Oh, Nick, go, go!
We're gonna lose them!
You keep nerd-stopping at every sign!
Look, if I get another ticket, they're gonna make me wear eyeglasses.
Why didn't you get involved back there?
Look, look, here's the reality.
Yes, Schmidt is my best friend, and he's also really scary.
You are so afraid of everything.
Oh, really?
Would a man afraid of everything - put his finger in a cigarette lighter?
- I don't know Don't do that.
That's just stupid!
- I'm not gonna do that.
- You wimp.
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my God!
- Jess, are you okay?
- It really hurts.
- Oh, my Lord, are - It's so hot!
- Come here.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Are you okay?
Look, I'm gonna do it.
Ow!
Oh.
Why did you do that?
So that we were both in the same amount of pain!
I'm gonna junk-punch him.
Turn the car around.
We're going to the restaurant.
Why would you ?
That seems rash.
Maybe I don't know.
Maybe staying away for a while, or at least I don't know talking about it, hearing his side.
I don't Cheating is selfish, and it is cowardly, and there is no excuse for it.
The only thing that you can do is punch it in the junk.
Or you could really understand it emotionally from their point of view.
You don't know.
Maybe they had a tough childhood.
- Turn the car around, Schmidt.
- Maybe their mom's a lesbian.
- I don't know.
- Turn the car around!
Yeah, let's do it.
Let's turn the car around.
Let's go to Picca.
I'm gonna turn the car around as soon as I turn this Turn the car around Schmidt!
- As soon as I turn the car around.
- Now!
As soon as I turn this car around Turn the car around, Schmidt!
Let's go!
And I'm turning the car around.
Let's do it.
Here we come.
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
Looks like he lost a wing.
Hey, Jess.
Yeah, fourth message.
Just a friendly time update.
guys aren't bailing on me, or maybe you just lost track of time being couples!
Hit me back.
Winnie the Bish.
We're never gonna find this restaurant; maybe we should just go home.
- There it is!
- Here it is.
Welcome!
- Can I have your car, sir?
- Oh.
Sir?
Sir?
Sir?
I'm on the phone.
All right, time's up.
You got to get out of here.
Uh, th that's my friend.
That's my friend.
See?
See?
I told you all.
Huh?
I got friends.
Everybody?
Hmm?
That's my friend right there.
Where the hell is Nick?
!
How did I even beat him here?
!
- That was the slowest ride of my entire life!
- Oh, Jess Literally, my grandmother drives faster than that.
- Look, she's my best friend.
- Yeah.
And Schmidt is mine.
That's why I didn't want to get involved.
Well, when someone I love gets hurt, I get involved.
Sir?
What's up, big cat?
Sir?
Sir?
Well, you got to go in there, and you got to face her.
Look, it's not about Cece.
This is about the $12 valet.
It's $12 to ?
One sec.
Hey, it's self-park!
The maroon car is self-park!
It's an excessive amount of money.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
Look, I know you didn't, okay?
But now it's time you do the right thing, Schmidt.
I can't go in there.
Well, I can't let Jess tell her.
Hello?
Open the door.
- Wait, Cece!
- Oh, Jess, I have something to tell you.
I have something to tell you!
What?
No, I have something I need to tell you.
Oh, my God, what are you doing, Cece?
!
Why did you do that?
!
Cece.
You nipped the corner!
Wait, Cece.
Uh okay.
I Cece, he's not I lied to you.
I I've been cheating on on you with Elizabeth.
Uh, I hate to do this right now, but if we don't sit, we will lose this table.
Cece, I'm sor I'm sorry.
I don't I just Is there someplace maybe we could, uh, go talk?
Everybody knows anyway, Schmidt.
Might as well just say it.
Oh, let's talk.
Let's we this should be fine.
I didn't want to hurt you.
You have to know that I did not want to hurt you.
Please, I I'm begging you.
If you take anything away from this, know that I did not want to hurt you.
I didn't want to hurt anyone.
Especially you.
You have no idea what you mean to me.
And I got caught up in this thing, and I used to be so fat.
I mean, like truly gigantic.
I mean, as big as as big as big as it gets.
And now and now I'm not, and girls like me, and I don't I don't know how to do this.
I got lost.
And I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
You didn't want to hurt anybody?
That's the best you can do, Schmidt?
Really?
I don't know.
I don't know you.
Good-bye, Schmidt.
I'm just realizing that I don't have any cash on me.
If anyone would be willing to loan me $12 for the valet, that would be greatly appreciated.
Cece still hasn't called me.
Do you think you could test my phone again?
I can't.
I don't have any more minutes.
Minutes, Nick?
!
Who still has minutes on their phone?
!
I bought 10,000 minutes in I'm sorry.
I just I I really want to be there for her.
You are, okay?
And she'll call, 'cause she needs you.
Hell.
This is a real butt munch of a situation we're in.
Yeah.
Look I'm here for you.
There is nothing I know more than the fact that I want to be with you, Jess, okay?
Unless we're driving.
You admitted to driving while legally blind!
No, because you're honestly the worst backseat You're honestly telling me what to do the entire time!
- Legally blind.
- Whoever has the wheel controls the car!
You liar!
Here's your pie!
You broke my heart.
Mail me my mouth guard.
In case you were wondering if Cece had Elizabeth's number, sh she does.
So, tough time in Schmidtsburg, wouldn't you say?
Just a quick heads-up, Nick, Jess.
I blame you for this whole thing.
- You can't seriously - I was going to fix it.
I wasn't going to hurt anyone.
But, since you took it upon yourself to hurt both of them, should it take me the rest of my life, I'm going to break the two of you up.
- Bring it, Schmidt.
- It's impossible.
We're really strong.
It will be when you least expect it, which might be when you most expect it.
Could actually be when you're watching the movie version of What to Expect When You're Expecting.
Regardless I am coming for you.
Oh, my God, Schmidt is so scary.
You were right.
We have to talk about the things - that he could use to pull us apart, okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay, politics.
You're a Democrat, I've never voted.
- I'm in the Green Party.
- Oh, that is so annoying.
Okay, I have been banned for my lifetime from Lake Ontario.
- Don't ask.
- Okay.
- What else do you have?
- My fear of pears.
Okay, you're afraid of pears?
And pear-shaped people.
Um, that's interesting.
I'm not convinced I know how to read.
I've just memorized a lot of words.
The doctors say I might grow another 18 inches.
That's a different image of you, but I'm gonna get past that, and I'm past it.
Okay, the moon landing - Uh, which is obviously fake.
- No, it's not obviously fake.
- No, that's actually not what - Are you crazy?
The moon landing is definitely fake, by the way.
- The moon landing's not - What?
!
The shadows are off.
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.
I've looked at photos on the Internet, and it proves it.
- Nick, that's - The shadows are off, the shadows are off !
Shadows are not those photos are Photoshopped.
- That's not true.
- People do that as a joke - to trick stupid people.
- Oh, yeah, you can just Photoshop - No, that's - Wait a minute.
He's doing it already.
He's getting in our heads.
- Unbelievable.
Good call.
- Okay, this is good.
Let's keep going.
- I totally agree.
Okay.
- Let's keep going.
Okay.
I kind of want to get a gun.
I'm definitely sexually attracted to Lady Bucks.
Ok.
I prefer the Killborn Daily Show.
I think it's the best one.
- I know that you're very into it - It's not.
Yes, it is.
He's very charming.
I'm weirdly good at volleyball.
I believe horses are from outer space.
- I believe that too!
- Ok.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
That is how you have sex, America.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
What's happening here is amazing.
Like, I want to film it, but I don't want to film it 'cause that would be porn.
And that time, I think I figured out what that thing underneath the thing was.
- Yeah, you did.
- And whoa, right?
Yeah, whoa.
Hey, should we take a break and, like, talk about our childhoods or something?
You know, get in there, get into it, get into each other's heads.
Dreams, thoughts, fears, feelings.
If Yeah I mean No?
I'm gonna throw a curveball.
I'm gonna go banana it and then I'll be ready for round two.
Define "banana it".
Eat a banana?
Oh, good.
I was worried for a second.
What are Nick and Jess doing in there, and how is it this loud?
Nick's body is so soft, it should absorb sound.
They're just getting warmed up, Schmidt.
It's a whole new ball game around here.
You, see, you wouldn't know that 'cause you haven't been here in weeks, but now that you're single, yeah, you got to deal with this, too.
Dumped by two women in the same day, Schmidt, that has got to be a record, man.
I get it, all right?
I lost two perfect women, but I'm fine with it, all right?
I'm fine.
You could've been perfectly happy with either one of them, - but now you're by yourself.
- Winston, I'm fine.
Please.
- That really has to hurt.
- This is my home, too.
I shouldn't have to be faced with their stupid, happy relationship everywhere I look.
This is going to stop, Winston, and I'm gonna stop it.
Well, my advice to you is to stay in your foxhole, keep your head down and invest in one of these babies.
Watch your butt, Ferguson.
This is my survival kit.
Check this out, man.
Blindfold.
Get this bell wrapped around my neck so he can hear when I'm coming.
Every couple has a weakness.
Kate and Will, I could break them up with one e-mail.
Oh, look at that, look at the royal baby now, - living with slutty Aunt Pippa.
- I'm telling you, they're bulletproof.
Um, I have to show Nick something in the bathroom.
Yeah, it's tiles.
I'm so bad at lying.
It's for sex.
Oh, go!
Go make love in our communal shower.
Enjoy it now, you little bunnies.
What?
Want to see a magic trick?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess I like your chewing face.
It's just food.
Yeah, that's all it is, okay, people?
I know it's super annoying to be around a couple.
Not me at all.
It's him.
Who?
Oh.
Look at him.
Yeah, we had a tough day today at the V-E-T.
Yeah, they said he's gonna have to get It rhymes with "fleutered".
The word is neutered.
Cats don't speak English.
Ferguson's never gonna experience actual, physical lovemaking.
Do you think you're a little too into your cat?
He should be out there, just getting all crazy, getting his freak on.
I feel bad, man.
I don't know what to do.
Let's try to help.
We got three smart people here.
We all know we got to get Ferguson laid, right?
Cat bachelor party.
- That's right.
- What do you think?
Yeah, get some little cat strippers.
Big booty cats, little booty cats.
Some tabbies.
- Some black ones, some white ones.
- Yeah.
We'll mix it up.
Get us a couple Siamese, get weird with it.
- Get him laid?
- You know we're kidding?
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Gotcha.
It's happening.
Oh, look, it's you and you.
Is that a cake?
Why do you have a sheet cake?
Don't eat the cake, Jess.
What is that?
Like, vanilla and vanilla?
I just wanted to wish you guys a happy one-month anniversary.
Hip hip.
You said you wanted to break us up.
You said you didn't care if it took your whole life.
Look, I understand that I'm not exactly your favorite person right now, but I didn't want a milestone in your relationship like this to-to go uncelebrated.
You're really great together.
I don't trust him.
I know.
It's Schmidt we're talking about.
After he saw the movie Titanic, he started the Billy Zane fan club.
- What?
- Look it up.
They're called the Zaniacs.
Why does that make me angrier than anything he's ever done?
- I will handle this.
- Okay.
And I'm gonna test this cake because I'm so mad at Schmidt.
Hey, dummy, why'd you get us that cake?
Come on, man, I'm just happy for you.
Looking at a-a month?
A big month, man.
How many relationships have you had that have lasted more than a month?
I don't know, some.
Probably very few, probably very, very few, right?
I mean, you think it's less than two?
One, it's Caroline, you know.
One?
Are you kidding me, man?
It's insane.
That's so few, but I guess you only need one, right, the one.
Too soon?
- I'm really happy, Schmidt.
- You should be, man.
Look at you.
You're like a different guy.
Usually at this point, you're overthinking and anxious and panicky and overthinking and overthinking and distant and nervous and sweaty and overthinking.
You're trying to get in my head, and it's not gonna work.
Who could, man?
Look at you.
You're cool as a cucumber.
You're Obama on the ski slopes.
Now, get out there.
Enjoy that cake with the woman that you love.
Too soon?
Forget about it.
Good talk.
Yeah.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Uh-oh.
Looks like we have a little Groundhog Day situation.
Please don't call it a Groundhog's Day situation.
Six more weeks of winter.
Don't worry.
Lie back.
I'm gonna take care of this.
This has never happened in my whole life, just so you know.
It's cool.
What can I do to help?
I don't know, maybe think outside of the box?
A little chicken kabob with rice.
Choice of naan or chutney.
- How about we - Shh!
Oh, I had it.
Reverse psychology.
I'm not attracted to you.
I don't think you're sexy.
- Don't want to have sex with you.
- Okay.
- I think you're a fat, fat, fatty, fat - Okay!
Oh, yeah.
Papa Smurf?
Really?
Whole body.
Are you sure?
- Yes, hey.
- Okay.
- This will work, let's do it.
- Okay.
Okay.
Well, at least the sun managed to get up.
I have to go move my car.
I'm kidding.
But I'm kidding!
Are we not kidding about this?
Does she have all her shots?
- Yep.
- Okay, cool, cool.
Um, let me ask you this.
Uh, does she strike you as, um, I don't know, slutty?
Excuse me, I'm here to pick up Fatty from her grooming.
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
- Who are you here to pick up?
- Well, actually, uh, my boy cat is looking for a girl cat.
Oh.
Well, I might know a girl cat who's looking for a boy cat.
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Does the girl cat have all her parts?
- Um, yeah.
- Yes?
Uh, okay.
Well, um, I don't know, maybe, uh, she could come over sometime?
Like, our cats could go on a date?
Yes, you get it.
You know, everyone else thought I was being weird.
So, um, how often do you groom your cat?
So I talked to my mom about it, - and my dad - I've got to go move my car.
Hey, no, it's important we talk about these things.
- Nick, it's - I'm moving my car!
Hello.
Whew, Nick looks exhausted.
You guys obviously had a good night.
Yeah, um, I We didn't sleep much.
Well, of course you didn't, you mangy little stray.
I really don't want to talk about it, - especially not with you, Schmidt.
- I know, and look, I also realize that it's gonna be a long time for me to regain your trust.
I just think it's sad because if you did have a Nick problem, I probably could help you out.
You know, my diploma says that I majored in communications, but my heart says that I majored in Nicholas studies.
I'm just saying.
I love the morning.
Anything's possible.
The whole day's ahead of you, you know?
Last night, Nick struggled with impotence.
Oh, my God, I'm not talking you about this.
Jess, look, I get it.
You don't want my help, but just do me a favor please.
Let me know when you're not mad at me anymore so I can tell you about how men crave danger and variety in their sexual lives.
I just hope it's not too late, fingers crossed.
What are you talking about?
I mean, I don't care, but if I did theoretically.
Theoretically, I would tell you for-for a man whose midsection is basically mush, Nick has had a lot of sex.
He's pushed that mush all over town.
And you know what, he's got some very weird taste.
Dark, real fringe stuff.
He likes stuff that they don't even have porn for.
And you know, a lot of women wouldn't think to do the Captain - in-in bed.
- What?
That was a mistake.
I shouldn't have said anything.
I didn't want to talk about the Captain.
It was a thing, and I did and Do you want a smoothie?
What's the Captain?
Well, it starts off with But you want to clean yourself up immediately.
I mean immediately.
And then you How comfortable are you with racial slurs?
Then you That's basically it.
That's what Nick wants in bed?
Yeah, I know.
Look, you're probably not up for it.
It's my It's my fault.
It's very degrading, it's offensive, and you, you just don't have the time to learn all those dolphin sounds.
Are you sure you don't want some of this smoothie?
It's straw-bana.
Okay, Ferguson, this is a big moment in your life.
All right, just be yourself, you dawg.
Winston, I think I found a way to You want to try some catnip?
This is a real bummer.
Ahoy, Nicholas.
Wait, I'm scared!
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'm so glad you could make it.
- Oh, thanks.
- Let's, um, let's head to my room.
Oh, you're not wasting any time.
You know, it's just that I have very judgy roommates, you know, that might get a little weirded out if they walked in the room and saw something they weren't supposed to see.
Oh.
Or it's whatever, whatever Fatty wants.
What do you want, Fatty?
Fatty wants to see your room.
That's awesome.
Great news.
You hear that, Ferguson?
- Y'all go play.
- Yeah?
There you go.
He was nervous.
Well, good thing I brought this.
Yeah, we can't give wine to these cats.
It's been a tough six months, and this cat needs a drink so O-Okay.
I don't think they care.
- They're not listening at all.
- Mm-mm.
- They're too into each other.
- Yeah.
Nick, we have to talk about this, okay?
All right, I'll go first.
Listen I was uncomfortable with some of the specifics of what we just did.
For example, when I said, "You like that, huh"?
I felt like you really, really didn't like it.
How do you feel?
I just I feel like, you know No, it's just kind of like be I mean Uh It was good, you know.
It's over.
Love sleeping birdsty.
I just want to know what I did wrong.
How does the Captain normally go?
- The what?
- The Captain.
What we just did.
I've never done that in my life.
- We did that because you wanted to, Jess.
- What?
!
Why would I want to do that?
That's degrading to not only women but all of mankind, Nick.
- I know.
- I only did that 'cause Schmidt told me it was your favorite thing Did you say, 'cause Schmidt said?
No, no, no, no.
Did you just Did you talk to tight pants and eyebrows Who was I supposed to talk to, Nick?
Every time I tried to talk to you about your penis problems, you went to move your car.
Those aren't penis problems.
What is Did you talk to Winston about my penis problems?
- What about Cece, did she get a call?
- He wasn't around.
Schmidt told me he had a PhD in Nickology.
He doesn't.
There's no such We have to talk about our feelings 'cause we're together.
If we needed to talk about feelings, they would be called "talkings".
No, that is not true.
Nick - That is 100% - This is it This is Schmidt getting in our heads.
- I'm going to kill him!
- Jessica, wait.
Schmidt!
I can't run that fast The Captain!
I trusted you.
You took advantage of me.
- Something wrong?
- You set us up.
I've done things to Nick I can't ever undo.
You see, your fatal flaw Communication.
You won't shut up about your feelings, and the only thing this dummy wants to talk about is the Chicago Brown Bears.
It's just the Chicago Bears.
There's no brown Who cares?
I put a pebble in your path and the two of you cracked your tiny little skulls on it.
Ooh, by the way, how was the Captain?
Did you make it all the way to the spyglass?
Yes, Schmidt!
And my night vision's very good 'cause my eyes are so buggy and big and I saw everything and I can't erase it from my memory.
Please, Jess, stop talking about the Captain.
Why don't we just go back to being roommates.
Okay?
Nick, what do you say?
The floor is yours.
You want to tell us how you feel?
- Me?
- Yeah.
Well I think it's I just Beautifully said.
Thank you, Nick.
Enjoy the breakup.
If you need me, I'll be in my room listening to some mainstream hip-hop.
Stop!
I have feelings.
I didn't like when you did the Captain.
It made me feel bad.
Okay, I've I've never seen this sober before.
Stop, it's my turn.
You talk too much and it frustrates me.
Sometimes you talk even after you've fallen asleep.
How do you breathe?
Where do you get the words?
But it doesn't matter, Jess, because I like you a lot.
But maybe do that less, okay?
Nick, I just feel Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Just keep going.
I don't know.
Um I really like the instrument of the cello.
I like the cello a lot, and I don't talk about it a lot but I should because I feel very passionate about it.
It's a beautiful instrument.
It's like a guitar but it stands up.
I once saw a zebra named Gavin give birth at the zoo, and I cried hysterically.
And then I bought one of those stretched out pennies that you can get to remember it and then I lost that and I cried again.
Sometimes when I smell dust in like an attic or something, like that mothy, dusty, I think about my mother.
When I was 14, I saw my mother change, and I saw her whole body naked without underpants on.
I really like when a rap song uses a choir.
It makes me feel really happy when all those ladies' voices come in and then the guy's rapping.
I think it's awesome.
I'm really proud of you, Nick.
- I really like you.
- I like you, too.
And it's been a month and I'm not scared.
Unless you're doing the Captain, and then I experience very real fear and it's very visceral Just kiss me.
No kissing in the living room!
No.
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no!
Cease lovemaking!
All lovemaking must cease.
- Get out of here, Schmidt!
- Break up!
- Just break up already, pl - Oh, forget it.
- I'm just I'm-I'm - Hey, no, no.
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, he just hit my sack.
Body block!
I'm pure core.
I've been training for this.
Yeah, human dental dam.
So What do you do for fun?
Huh?
Oh, um You know, like all good things.
Like what?
Tell me one thing.
I'm sorry, do you hear noise?
- Oh - Do you hear shouting?
- 'Cause I'm just - Yeah.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Who the hell messed up the mood?
!
- Schmidt, Schmidt.
- Hey.
Put down my condoms.
Pull it together, Schmidt.
It's raining celibacy.
Hallelujah.
- You're losing it, man.
- If I'm not having sex in this loft, nobody's having sex in this loft.
Hyah!
Oh, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Oh, my birth control pills.
You don't want to do this, my man.
Yes, I do want to do this.
It's the only way to get this place back to the way that it was.
- Put them down.
Give them to me.
- Give them to Jess.
Come on, buddy, it's not worth it.
No fear!
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
- Oh, my God.
Why didn't you just throw them in the sink, you idiot.
You better pray that was a placebo week.
Is he eating birth control pills?
Friday!
Full wheel, bitches!
I win.
I don't feel good.
Guys, come on, our cats were just about to have sex.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, this whole time I thought What?
Fatty, come on.
We're out of here.
So, what do you guys think, loft meeting in 20?
Yeah, I'll be there in 15.
Got to stick my head in a paper bag and scream at the top of my lungs.
Oh, yeah, there'll be no snacks.
Schmidt, I just looked it up.
There's no way estrogen works that fast.
- You don't know my body.
- Please, stop talking about your body.
Okay, that's a good segue to some of the more relevant topics that I would like to cover in this meeting.
Like, uh, personal space.
Public space.
Other people's medicines Taking them versus not taking them.
I am so aware of my nipples right now.
Okay, that's a good start.
If someone were to blow on my nipples, I would positively scream.
Boundaries.
Any takers?
All right, we live here.
Where are we supposed to go?
This is my fault.
'Cause I'm going through a sexual awakening.
It's like I'm tapping into this raw sexual energy that the universe is putting forth.
And it's just both imploding and exploding at the same time.
And it's kind of like I'm a young nun.
And Nick is my sexy monseigneur.
And I'm a I'm just going to shut up.
Both of you need to shut up, okay?
You're having sex, not inventing it.
- It can't be that good.
- It's good.
Stop saying, "Squeeze my biscuits".
- I'm serious, Nick.
- Sorry.
And, Schmidt, stop taking it out on everybody else, man.
Deal with your breakups.
Ain't no way in hell I got a cat brothel going on in my room and I'm the only normal person in this loft.
You did a bad thing.
Deal with it.
What's that?
Oh, it's just what I needed.
This gum is crap.
You ready?
What is it?
Just keep your eyes closed.
- All right, stand right there, okay?
- Okay.
Turn around.
- I love it.
- Yeah.
I don't I don't know what it is.
All right, then yell something.
I soundproofed it.
What's wrong?
I just heard yelling.
Get out of here, man.
He must He must've literally been right by the door.
It is soundproofed That's what the egg crates are for, so Nick, I just want to say something.
Um This last month has been the best month of my life.
Me, too.
I've never, you know, felt this way or had this with anybody.
It's like there's been this fog around my life, and with you, all of a sudden it's gone.
I love that you can express your feelings now.
Yeah, it's a weird feeling.
It's kind of like gross but also good.
You know?
It's like an egg broke.
And then, like, all the yolk comes out but it's good.
I'm happy to admit I like love songs.
I understand them.
They're really sad.
They're mostly about either the girl or the guy got away.
They're heartbreaking numbers.
The air Do you feel it?
I guess this is the air you breathe, but it's nice.
I feel like I'm on this whole new planet.
How about your two favorite planets?
Oh, yeah, those are great.
But I also feel like being with you, I've finally, for the first time, and I know this sounds crazy, but I can see the stars.
You know, the other great thing about talking about our feelings is we don't need to do it all the time.
Thank you for expressing that.
- I feel like I can see you - Uh-huh.
in 3-D vision.
- Everyone sees in 3-D.
- Hmm.
So, would you like to take my bra off, or should I?
See, I feel excited to take your bra off.
- So, do it.
- I love your breasts.
Just mixing it up with those two things.
- I'm not even nervous to do it.
- So, do it.
- I feel excited to Okay, right now.
- Let's do this.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Damn, man.
You look tired.
Your eyes are puffy as hell.
I'm unwell, Winston.
I'm just torn up about this whole Cece and Elizabeth thing.
I feel so guilty, I can't even look at myself in the mirror.
Do you think that I'm good person?
I'm gonna Hey, guys, do you guys think that I'm a good person?
You're a terrible person.
- It's hilarious.
- You cheated on my best friend, Schmidt.
F-Fair enough.
Okay.
Well, I'm better than Winston.
You're better at things than Winston, but he's a better person.
- Winston freakin' stinks!
- Okay, why am I being dragged into this?
Because I'm mad, Winston.
And I'm tired.
And I'm a good I'm a good man.
Are you crying?
I got a package for Nick Miller.
There's nobody here by that name.
I got this.
I saw that.
- Run, Nick!
Run!
- Aah!
What?
Relax, I'm with your late father's estate.
- Pop-pop?
- This is for him.
What's in there?
It's a hand, isn't it?
Just tell me if it's a hand.
Oh, my God!
- It is a hand.
- It's a I knew it.
It's a hand.
What does that mean, though?
Full of dollar bills, y'all!
You are rich, man!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess I can't believe Nick's dad left him $8,000.
I've never seen someone burn through money so fast.
I should say something.
Some of these shoes aren't even his size.
Look, Jess, you don't want to talk to Nick about money, okay?
It is a very touchy subject.
I'm gonna check out this fancy picture place.
Seems like rich guys always have pictures of themselves.
My man.
Do you, baby.
I'm gonna be honest with you.
Nick owes me is my opportunity to get it back.
How are you expecting to get your money back if he blows it all on stupid stuff?
Oh, don't worry, Jess.
I have a plan.
Hey, listen, you know you don't have to con him if he actually owes you money.
You can just ask him.
I just told you to ask him for the money.
Smile Do the crystals make it look too glamorous?
It's really glamorous.
I don't even know.
I don't know what's cool anymore.
It could be a good time to start a bank account.
Yeah, or I could just flush it down the toilet.
It's not really the same thing, but A bank is just a paper bag but with fancier walls.
That's all it is.
I'm gonna keep my money where my mouth is.
Um, under my nose.
That saying actually does work.
- What is that?
- This is my box.
It's where I keep all my junk that I don't feel like dealing with.
That looks like a lot of bills.
It's mostly bills.
Like I said, it's junk.
You know, I'm just brainstorming here, but what if you paid some of those bills with the money you just got?
Yeah.
I'm gonna "pay my bill".
And what's next?
I'm gonna go to the doctor and get a checkup.
Give them $500 to check my bones.
You're being funny.
So, yeah, I was dating both of them at the same time.
I'm a mess.
I can't sleep.
I urinate constantly.
I cried the other day listening to a techno song.
My tweets have been extremely literal.
Were the girls Jewish?
One Indian, one regular.
Do you want to see a picture?
I-I don't even know why you're here.
You come in and say, "Do you have a minute"?
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry, Rabbi.
It's just that Okay, it's much more simple.
How can I be a better person?
Oh.
Well, you seem awfully concerned with yourself.
You might want to start thinking about the needs of others.
I think about others all the time.
What-what I can get from them, how they can give me pleasure, do they have a silly little walk - that I can make fun of?
- No, th-that's It's where you actually care about somebody else.
You put their needs ahead of your own.
This is one of the few times that I wish I was Catholic.
Couple Hail Marys and I'd be off the hook.
Huh?
Oh, God.
Whoa.
Are you choking?
You're choking.
Okay.
Uh What, are you biking and eating?
All right, I got you, I got you.
Come on!
Live!
Live!
Live, biker!
- Ew.
Yeah!
- Thank you.
You saved my life.
What?
You saved my life.
You saved my life.
- I did.
Yes.
Yes.
- Thank you Thank you Yes!
Dude!
This is exactly what I needed.
Oh, my God.
Let us rejoice in song.
Sh'ma Yis'ra'eil Adonai Eloheinu - Please call 911.
I'm hurt.
- Oh, yeah, no, that's a great idea.
I'm gonna call 911.
I hope you don't have a dance recital later.
I'm just kidding.
Don't look at your legs.
That's, uh, $900 to the Parking Authority of Los Angeles.
Oh, is it okay to mail cash?
I'm gonna do it anyway.
All right, it's on its way.
- Sliders are beautiful.
- I know, man.
- I knew you would think that.
- I love 'em, dude.
That's why I made 'em.
What is that?
Brotherhood.
Brotherhood, man.
All right, man.
I respect you, man, no matter what.
That's what it's about, man.
Yeah, and, um in the spirit of brotherhood just 'cause we on that level right now I was just thinking - maybe, I don't know, um - Anything, man.
Shoot.
Oh, man.
Maybe you can just pay me back that money that you owe me.
Remember?
'Cause you owe me that money?
- Uh, Nick?
Nick?
- Oh - Nick?
Nick?
Hey, Nick.
- Oh, you stink!
- Um, can we?
- You son of - You son of a bitch, Winston!
- Can we can we That's what this is about?
!
Nick, it's my money, okay?
!
Give it back to me!
I make a little bit of money and you come slipping out of the "woodword"!
You mean "woodwork"?
What is "woodwork"?
!
What's "woodword"?
!
Wood!
Word!
Wood!
Word!
That's where people like you come crawling out of when people like me have money!
- But you owe me that money!
- Stay out of my damn box - is the point, man!
- I'm not in your box!
Jess gets it, right?
Yeah, what's What the hell, dude?
I'm gonna go to the bar to blow off some steam.
That's a great idea.
Go get loaded.
You deserve it.
Black out.
You are the only one that I trust around here.
Oh You went through Nick's box.
Look, it was so much worse than I thought.
Why does he have the deed - to an old Mercury Cougar in there?
- Oh, yeah, he lost that.
For crying out loud, where is it?
We've been looking for hours.
- It's done.
- What about your car, Nick?
I said it's done.
I'll just get the money back.
Bill collectors are reasonable people, right?
- That makes sense.
- You better keep your mouth shut, Winston!
I'll make you a deal.
I'll keep my mouth shut if you pay me the money Nick owes me.
Are you trying to blackmail me?
You don't scare me, Jess.
How much does Nick owe you?
$1,900.
But what is money anyway?
You know, it's just paper that some king on the mountains said was worth something.
You know?
Gold, I understand.
It's shiny and you can make jewelry out of it.
Silver?
Put a werewolf in front of me, he's dead.
Brass creates the bells that make sound throughout the land.
But we kill each other for paper.
I gotta tell you, man, that's sad.
You give me $50, I'll show you my private parts.
Nicholas, good yontef.
- Are you well?
- No, but good yontef.
You know, I'm all steamed up.
This money thing is tearing me apart, Schmidt.
All right, if it's bothering you that much, why don't you just give it away?
Son of a bitch!
Not, not to me, Nick, to charity, or tzedakah as my people call it.
- That's what your people do?
- Yeah.
You beautiful genius.
I like that.
That frees me of my worries.
Oh, look at that!
Another mitzvah!
I'm two for two today.
- Yeah!
Mitzvah!
- I saved a man.
You know, there was a lowly bike messenger.
Was just riding along, choking on his gum.
And I performed Heimlich's maneuver on him, rescued him.
- Great.
- Yeah, who's the good man now?
You're almost forced to admit it.
Almost You're almost forced to admit it.
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm a hero, Nick, now Just tell me that I'm a good man.
I really need to hear it.
I don't even know if I'm a good person.
I'm not the guy to ask.
- I have my moods.
- But we're not talking about you.
We're talking about me right now and how I'm a good person, so it'd be really nice if you could say that.
- I'm ready to do a tzatziki.
- Tzedakah.
This is not about tzedakah right now.
This is about me being a good man and you telling me that.
- Absolutely.
- So, well, say it.
- You got it.
- S-Say that I'm a good man.
I'm giving away my money.
I've been trying to listen - to you this whole time!
- Damn it, Nick, you are so drunk right now - and at the bar you work at, no less.
- Yeah.
What happens with the rest of your day?
Do you even think about that?
You don't understand drinking at all.
Don't go.
Heathcliff.
Hi, I'd like to unpay some parking tickets.
- Excuse me?
- Well, I sent in a payment earlier for some tickets and I decided I don't want to pay them.
Well, just cancel the checks.
Can't do that 'cause I paid cash 'cause my boyfriend doesn't believe in banks.
It's early in the relationship.
Still shaving above the knee if you know what I mean.
Mm-hmm.
Let me get this straight You want me to watch the mail and let you know if I see anything from your boyfriend.
- Exactly.
- Fantastic.
Should I call you or?
- Text, text would be great.
- Perfect.
Let me put your number into my phone.
- I didn't give you my number yet.
- Oh, I think you did.
It's your lucky day, old friend.
I had an interesting talk with Schmidt, and I've decided to give away my fortune.
So, what do I owe you?
- How much money d?
Uh - Hey, guys, what's going on?
Hey, Jess, um It's tzatziki is what it's called.
It's a Jewish charity.
Nick was just about to pay me the money that he owes me.
Wait!
Come on, what are you doing?
I'm, uh, I'm lubing up, Sally From ankles to ears?
The door's locked You want me to bust in?
Son of a It opened!
Where are you?
Um, I just was hot, I wanted some shade.
Oh, done that.
He take my money?
Winston!
It was me, it was me, it was me.
I'm so sorry, I went through your box I just couldn't help it and I paid some of your bills, and I'm so sorry I Hey, Nick You gonna leave me here?
Nick That's fair.
There he is, alive and well.
Yeah.
Mazel.
I br-brought you these.
How's my brave little soldier doing, huh?
Not great.
They said that I'm never gonna be able to ride a bike again, - so there goes my job.
- Sure, sure.
Do you think that I'm a good person?
I I don't really know you.
Well, what more do you need to know?
If not for me, you probably would have died today.
Well, somebody probably would have come along.
Just say that I'm a good person.
- Well, I mean - Why is that so hard for you to say?
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
- You're, you're a good person.
- I am?
You really think so?
Very good.
Thank you for saying that.
- Yeah.
- That really means It means a lot.
I finally feel like I can breathe again.
Good.
What happ What happened to him?
Well, he got smoked by a bus while he was having a bake sale for cancer kids.
For, for canc for cancer kids?
- Yeah.
- But he-he's, he's a great person.
Bad things happen to good people all the time.
Of course they do.
What am I even chasing here?
What is the point of being a good person?
Some say moral integrity is the cornerstone to humanity.
What do you know, you idiot?
You choked on a piece of gum today.
Hey, man, don't shoot the bike messenger.
That is a terrible joke!
And none of this makes any sense!
Hey, Nick.
Look, I know you're really angry and you have a right to be.
I have the right to be?
I mean, why do you feel like you need to fix me?
It's like you think you know better.
Well, I m I might know better than you.
Did you start a corporation?
- Was it Fat Face?
- I think so.
Yeah.
Well, you're getting taxed like crazy.
Well, that's because I thought I was filing a patent.
Fat Face is an invention?
Kind of in its intention It was suppo it - Are you a lifeguard?
- No, that is a false certificate.
Just a classic beach prank.
That seems dangerous.
It's funny, 'cause I I can't swim.
Everyone was watching me, and I'm like, "I don't know" I was 13!
I was 26.
This is the problem with the box.
It's my private stuff.
You've never once done jury duty or paid your taxes.
Not until gay marriage is legal everywhere.
I stand by that.
And I don't want to do jury duty or pay taxes.
Nick, you're in so much debt, it's crazy.
- You have to deal with this stuff.
- No, I don't, Jess, it's in my box.
That's not true, though.
It's not a perfect system, Jess, but it's mine, okay?
And it's private.
Well, I'm sorry I went through your damn box, but I was just trying to help you, Nick.
So maybe I'll try to help you.
What if I went into your box?
Not that.
- Stop it!
- I like that box, but I'm mad at you!
I'm back to "You disrespected me".
- I was just trying to help.
- Well, then, how about this Two can help.
Okay?
And if two are going to help, then I'll be one of them 'cause two can tango on this dance, okay?
So, you want to waltz?
Well, you picked the wrong dance partner.
Two can play.
What?
It's not a Who needs changing, huh, who needs fixing?
I'm gonna go through your personal drawers and see what needs changing.
What are you, a zoo elephant?
Those are my night peanuts.
There shouldn't be day peanuts and night peanuts!
They're just peanuts!
I'm sorry, why is that weird?
You just have a bunch of boxes?
I would change that.
- Oh, you have a bunch of metal toothpicks.
- They're bobby pins.
- What's a bobby pin?
- It keeps your hair back.
You need Bobby's pins to put your hair up?
It's bobby pins, not Bobby's pins.
- What is this?
!
- Yarn.
What are you knitting, a mansion?
!
Oh, look at this.
What do we have here?
A bunch of beat-up old sacks.
- My vintage purses.
- Well, you know what?
- They could be sexier.
- You want my purses to be sexier?
Would it kill you to get something sleek, covered in gems for once?
You want my purses to be covered in gemstones?
All guys do!
That's what we think is sexy!
We want to be playing a saxophone in an alley and have you walk by in a miniskirt with a purse with gems.
- But you girls don't listen!
- What?
!
- Changing!
- No!
Nick, no!
- This all is changing.
- No, no, stop!
That's disrespectful!
- Gone!
- Nick, stop it!
No!
This is the grossest thing I've ever seen in my life!
- I got that for a nickel.
- It's disgusting.
You're just trying to get a rise out of me.
Oh, my God!
I've gotten a lot of compliments on that one.
- Gone!
- Nick!
What?
Stop it!
Look, I like you the way you are.
I'm just asking you to grow a little.
Are we ever gonna get to a point where you stop working on me?
Instead of changing me, maybe once, Jess, see it my way.
Well, your way's crazy and illegal.
This is me, take it or leave it.
I'm not changing for anyone.
Hey, where are you going?
If you have something to say, just say it.
Don't write me a note or That's the money I spent.
Do what you want with it.
Thank you.
Couple of best friend horses.
That's neat.
What else can you get on?
It doesn't make any sense.
Can you not see I'm in the middle of a bar mitzvah class here?
Yeah, well, they should hear this.
A man helping cancer kids got creamed by a bus today.
Everything happens for a reason.
But what if it doesn't happen for a reason?
Maybe Maybe there aren't any good guys and bad guys.
Maybe there are just winners and losers.
I was beating myself up, but maybe I should Maybe I should have been celebrating.
- Have you ever dated two women at once?
- What are you talking about?
I went to camp They used to call me the Octopus.
- Clearly, you have not, sir.
- That's enough.
You get out of here right now!
- Out.
- Don't you "out" me.
- Get out, get - Getting a little handsy there, Rabbi.
- Get out!
- You know what I realize?
Nothing matters, and that's great.
You know why?
Because if nothing matters, we can do whatever we want, Rabbi.
Avram!
Julio!
Get away from me, man.
Kick his ass!
All right, okay.
YOLO!
YOLO!
Nick's right.
I have too many purses.
You're addicted to purses.
I'm addicted to development fluid.
I get it.
This one's for meat, and this one's for shells.
You know what?
- Keep them.
They're yours.
- Okay, thanks.
Also, heads up The ass of your pants is missing.
It's for the kitty cats.
- My phone's ringing.
- Sure.
Hello?
I'm like a pretty lady.
What's happening?
I'm sorry to bother you, Miss Day, but this man was trying to open an account with a check in your name and a paper bag full of money.
Would you please stop hovering?
I'm being cooperative.
It's fine.
He's okay.
Thank you, though.
Opening a bank account, huh?
Yeah, I, uh - I realized something.
- What?
I'd do anything for you, Jess.
Hey.
Thank you.
All right, Mr. Miller, your checking account is good to go.
Oh, there's just an eight dollar processing fee.
Eight dollars?
That's a very specific amount.
That's fine It's your world, your rules, so Excellent.
You go to the castle, you got to pay the king.
What is processing?
What does that mean?
It's just a word you use to make more money off of us.
- That makes me mad!
- Me, too, yeah.
Hey, how about this?
What's a bank?
- Yeah.
- It's just a paper bag - That's right.
Yes!
- with walls.
You're making some really, really, really good points, ma'am.
You are the puppeteers that puppet the world.
No more banks!
Or some banks I don't care!
But I want my money on a boat!
I understood at least 30% of the financial crisis, and guess what I got from that?
- You suck!
- Yeah.
You suck so hard.
And now, I'm gonna process this man's face, 'cause I think he's great.
And I'm crazy about him.
Fine, I'll waive the fee.
Yeah!
We won eight dollars!
Just wait till you have children.
You'll never touch each other again.
Banks suck!
Banks suck!
What the hell happened to you?
Got beat up by some rabbis.
Well, Winston, we're all alone.
Nothing matters.
But you know what?
Look Schmidt, stop, all right?
You're a good man.
You did a bad thing doesn't make you bad.
We just have to try to be better, you know?
Been waiting all day for somebody to tell me that.
I I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
I want you to have something.
Winston, literally, a gift is the last thing I des - This is - There you go.
This is a candelabra.
Yeah.
I bought it with the money that Nick owed me.
- This is what you spent it on?
- And now it's yours.
Uh-huh.
May it illuminate your path and lead you out of the darkness.
That's what it says on the bottom.
May it illuminate your path, lead you out of darkness.
Uh, uh, thank you for this really.
Look at it every single day and tell yourself "I'm a good person," 'cause you are.
You know what I might do, though?
And it might seem like the opposite, but what I'm actually thinking is, maybe I'll just put it away somewhere, like in I don't know in the back of my closet so to keep it away from thieves.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Can you be honest with me real quick?
- Mm-hmm.
How many times did you rub this thing and think a genie was gonna come out?
I ain't gonna lie to you man.
- I rubbed it, like, three times.
- Yeah.
- I thought so.
- You know, I'm not If a genie did come out, what would you wish for?
- More candelabras.
- Yeah, I bet.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hey, what took you so long?
Come on in.
Hey.
No, no.
Why are we having a secret meeting in an empty loft?
Because I don't want Schmidt to find us.
- It's creepy, right?
- I know, right?
- Yeah, it is.
- This place gives me the willies, man.
Do you know why they can't keep a tenant in here?
- Why?
- Because Mrs. Beverly died on the toilet.
And to come here on Halloween?
- Seems risky.
- What's risky?
The ghost situation.
I brought you guys in here to talk about Schmidt.
I'm really worried about him.
He hasn't been to work for three days.
He just sits on the couch eating cold cuts and yelling at the news about how nothing matters.
- It's a problem.
- Right.
Be honest, it's a real problem.
He's just going through a whole thing, you know?
The Cece-Elizabeth breakup has gotten to him.
Right now he is completely unhinged.
- Y'all feel that?
- What is going on?
Not saying there's a ghost, but I felt a weird breeze go through my body, - that's all I'm saying.
- There's no ghost.
Guys, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I miss the old Schmidt.
I want him to be happy again.
He's crumbling before our very eyes.
And I'm having a party tonight, and I just can't have him lying on the couch, wiping his tears with deli meat.
- I'll talk to him, okay?
- Thank you.
People get weird with breakups.
Trust me, I got this.
- You got this.
- That was Winston.
- Was that you or was that in here, dude?
- That was Don't do that!
Oh, come on, Obama.
Tanks pull in, tanks pull out.
Babies are born, old people die.
And yet the world keeps spinning and spinning and spinning, and one day, it stops.
And then what?
You want you want to talk about health care?
That's mayo, buddy.
Yeah, I don't got this.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Season 3, Episode 6 "Keaton" - Pumpkining - You're really good at that.
Thanks, man.
Yeah.
What are you carving there?
- It's a pumpkin.
- Oh, look at that.
That's beautiful.
- My pumpkin!
- Pumpkin doesn't matter.
Hey.
I just wanted to talk to you, um - About my party tonight.
- You don't want me to come to the party?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Jess, do you not want me to come to your party?
- No.
I No.
- Doesn't matter.
I wouldn't go if I weren't throwing it, you know?
It's, like, more of a business-networking It's not a big deal at all.
I just won't come.
I'll stay at home, and I'll just hang out in my costume.
Oh, wait a minute.
Your home is my home.
See you at the party.
- What the hell?
- He's a total maniac.
Well, you know what, Jess?
He doesn't get like this often.
But when he does, oh, there is an option.
Nick, I think it's time for Schmidt - to get a letter from an old friend.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What old friend?
- Forget you heard anything.
- What old friend?
- Nothing, J - We need him, Nick.
- No, we don't.
- We got to bring him back.
- Bring who back?
- Winston, don't do this!
- Guys, does nobody listen to me?
!
- without him!
- Who is he?
- Michael Keaton.
- You stupid Michael Keaton, the actor?
The Batman?
Nick, are you gonna tell her, or should I?
- I'm not telling her.
- Fine.
I'll do it.
- You will?
- When Schmidt was seven years old You're a terrible storyteller.
I'll just do it myself, I guess.
When Schmidt was seven years old, his daddy divorced his mommy And Schmidt was left without the love of a father.
He didn't take it well.
He began an endless cycle of crying and chocolate.
Mrs. Schmidt tried everything to cheer him up, but nothing worked.
Desperate, she looked to the stars.
Movie stars.
Mrs. Schmidt wrote that little fat loser a letter of support from the star of his favorite movie, Batman.
But not the confusing new one.
The good one, with Michael Keaton.
And when Schmidt got his disgusting chubby hands on Keaton's letter, his life changed forever.
Yes!
But the real trouble was just beginning.
You see, Schmidt wrote back.
And he kept writing back about any problem he faced: bullies, schoolwork, public erections.
And for every letter he sent, Michael Keaton sent one back.
Was Winston's version shorter?
Then one day, that tubby goon went off to college.
Whoa.
So Mrs. Schmidt unloaded the secret on her son's only friend, a man named me.
It was me.
- Yeah, I got that.
- Really?
People don't No, I got it.
College proved tough for Schmidt, and old patterns soon returned.
It became impossible to study, and I knew what I had to do.
And again - New message.
- It worked.
With Keaton in his corner, he pulled himself away from that bag of turkey - and became a man.
- One He lost five pounds, gained confidence with women and he saw the hit movie Multiplicity - 25 times.
- Oh, my God.
You've been cat fishing Schmidt.
Do you think we could use this whole Michael Keaton thing - to turn Schmidt around?
- Absolutely.
- Great!
- But I won't do it.
- Why not?
- Because I put it to bed, okay?
It's over.
He'll do anything Keaton says.
The letters are too powerful.
I'm lying to my best friend.
And I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.
Well, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick?
Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.
But I won't do it.
Sorry.
You think you tell that story better than me?
Look, you leave out way too many details, man.
You don't just say he was chewing a candy bar.
You say he was chewing on a nougat-y candy bar.
That's not the kind of writer I am.
I don't say words like "nougat-y".
I'm simple.
I'm like Hemingway.
- Hey, Cece.
- Oh, hey.
I came to find out if you're coming to my party today.
You never answered my e-mail.
Yeah, I meant to, uh to tell you I can't make it.
Sorry.
Um I've been going out drinking a lot lately.
It's kind of wiping me out.
Please come to my party, Cece.
It's Schmidt, you know?
- I don't think I'm ready for that, so - Yeah.
What if I could promise you Schmidt wouldn't be there?
Who wants candy?
- Did you go trick-or-treating?
- No.
I was out, I had my errand tote, and a couple of neighbors gave me candy.
Is that trick-or-treating?
Yes, that's the definition of trick-or-treating, Jess.
Hello!
Uh, Jess, I'd like you to know that I've changed my mind, and I won't be coming to your party tonight.
I've been e-mailing with an old friend of mine, and he made me realize - that I should give Cece her space.
- An old friend, huh?
Well, Nick knows.
You know, I don't like to throw his name around because I don't like people treating me any differently, but It's Michael Keaton.
What?
!
Uh, okay.
Calm down.
The actor?
!
Seriously, you guys.
Don't treat me any different.
He's kind of my friend.
Michael Keaton.
There was one time he e-mailed me.
He said he was my best friend.
Anyway, we have so much catching up to do, me and Michael, so just enjoy the night.
That's crazy, Schmidt.
Ah, man.
- What did you do?
- Jessica Damn Day.
I just got Schmidt to not come to the party.
Keaton hasn't written Schmidt in three years.
We have no idea how Schmidt is gonna react.
If Schmidt finds out Keaton isn't real, it'll destroy the entire life he has built around him.
We are talking about a Truman Show situation.
Oh, yeah, I love that movie.
What part are you talking about?
Well, I'm talking about the part in the movie when Truman realizes that his whole life is a lie, and then he goes crazy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there in the middle of the movie.
No, it's the whole movie.
Oh, yeah, I know, I was just 'cause there's the one - There's like a scene.
- You haven't seen it.
He didn't see the movie.
Okay, guys, he almost found out once.
Now, luckily, I handled it.
I don't understand.
In 1995, he told me specifically that he had never been to Nicaragua.
It doesn't make any sense.
Aah!
You have no idea what you've done.
Hey, uh, you guys, do you think that it's too early to e-mail Michael back?
Should I send him an e-card?
Does that change anything, or does that change everything?
- I think you're overthinking it.
- You know what?
- You're right.
You're right.
- Be cool.
I think I'm way too up here, all upstairs.
Got to bring it down here to here.
Not any lower, though.
It's not like that.
- I know it's not.
- Bro, it's not like that.
- No one thinks it is, bro.
- Cool.
All right.
He's already getting weird.
- Here.
- No, Je You come to the master.
What are you writing?
I fixed it again.
You're welcome again.
So you just wrote from Keaton, "I'm going on vacation"?
He would never write that, Jess.
- Why not?
- Vacation?
!
Oh, Michael, you stop going away.
I knew this would happen.
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Schmidty.
He left me again.
It makes sense.
Why would a guy like Michael Keaton be friends with me anyway?
I'm sure he likes you a lot, Schmidt.
Why would he?
I guess I'll just always be the fat boy who eats fat-boy cheese.
I didn't want to have to do this.
Oh, is that really necessary, Nick?
- Shh.
- What?
Let him work.
I'm kind of like his Robin.
- You're not like my Robin.
- You want to be Robin?
He doesn't have all the responsibilities of Batman, but he can take some of the glory.
- Robin's a joke.
- Robin's the joke.
I think we can all agree.
The kids look up to him, you know, in the community.
I haven't been inside Keaton's mind in a long time, and I need my proper inspiration.
Thank you.
Why do you have a picture of a bear?
The great Michael Keaton attacks each new role with the ferocity of a hungry brown bear.
It is his entire acting philosophy, which I totally made up.
I sleep with this person.
Speak to me, Keaton.
Mmm.
Here we go.
Oh, hey, Nick, that's incredible.
"Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it"?
Yes, I stole that from Nelson Mandela.
I added the part about the Penguin and the Riddler.
Oh.
All right.
Is that him?
Did it work?
He wrote back smiley face.
- He wrote back smiley face.
- He wrote back smiley face.
- Trick or treat!
- Oh, how adorable.
You know, I just got a treat, too.
It's not candy; I'm not a Not a dumb little baby like all of you.
"Happy Hallow's Eve".
And send.
- Just give us our candy.
- Hush, little boy.
He wrote back.
- "Hi".
- Okay, I got this.
"Speak to me, old chum.
"I canceled my trip to provide earthquake relief.
This seemed more important".
Boom.
- That's so good.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.
You really have the Keaton voice down.
"You're a friend for life".
- That's good.
- "M.K." - I think that's good.
- I think that's really good, actually.
Hi.
Welcome.
Happy Halloween.
Drinks are over there.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- What are you supposed to be?
- I'm Joey Ramona Quimby.
I don't get it.
Joey Ramone a Quimby.
What are you?
You look like you're just wearing trash from your car.
No, I'm not.
I'm the Paper Mountain Trash King I just got trash from my car.
And now the man who once played center for the New York Knicks in the nude, David Letterman!
- That is a terrible Letterman.
- Really?
People at work tell me I look just like Dave.
You look just like Letterman.
You know, I have always thought that.
What, uh, what uh, Nick, Nick Miller.
So you a, uh?
You're a - What is that?
- That's, that's his laugh.
- He's never done that.
- That's his laugh.
Do you like my costume?
I'm a public serpent.
Um, I thought you weren't coming.
Oh, I changed my mind.
You know, I reread a few of Keaton's e-mails.
He can be quite cryptic.
I think what he meant when he said that life was meaningful was really, "Go to the party".
- I'm pretty sure he didn't mean that.
- I know Keaton best.
Hey, Winston, by the way, great costume.
Maya Angelou.
Crap.
What am I gonna do?
Cece's on her way.
Schmidt is rereading e-mails.
Do you know what happens after rereading?
Figuring it out.
It's The Truman Show.
Truman Show, man, I love that movie.
I'm not convinced you've ever seen it.
I have; it's about the Civil War.
- Batcave?
- Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go.
- Winston, go to Cece's and stall.
- Okay, fine.
But I got to hit the little King of the Late Night Talk Show's room first.
Maybe slow down on that.
You're not great with booze.
- Hey, I got it, I got it.
- You got it?
Good.
Um, "You're in grave danger.
Leave where you are immediately".
- Send.
Okay.
- Don't!
- You just sent that?
- Yeah.
A team has to talk about a decision before you hit send.
Sorry.
I thought it was a really good move.
- Trick or treat.
- Shh.
All right, you got to fix this.
I'll meet you at your building in 30 minutes.
Terrible!
Send.
- No!
- What?
Now what are we gonna do?
- You told him Keaton was coming here?
- No, Nick.
- Are you out of your mind?
- It's a stall!
It's a stall Until we can come up with a better plan.
- Well, who the hell is that?
- I don't know.
Trick or treat!
You.
I don't get what you're doing!
Are you drunk?
A little.
- What's your endgame here?
- It's Halloween night.
This is the night when anyone can dress up in a costume and be anybody that they want.
Would you listen to your woman voice for one second?
Oh, you think I'm gonna talk to him in a woman voice when I'm talking to him?
No, I have a character.
You're doing a character?
Well, I'd love to hear it.
I'm the Batman.
- Oh.
- Right?
So good.
What, am I in the movie theater, eating popcorn?
Jess, you're also five, four.
Keep going further away.
The further you're away, the bigger you look.
- I would say run a little bit.
- Nick!
Jess, go!
Go - Hey.
Uh, Nick.
- Hey.
By chance, have you seen anyone famous in the vicinity?
This vicinity?
Famous?
Like, um - Look that way.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it's unbelievable.
- Well, it's my hero.
- Yeah.
- That is Michael Keaton.
- Right there.
Why is he wearing his costume from the movie he did 24 years ago?
If he wore the outfit from Clean and Sober, you wouldn't recognize him.
- I'm the Batman.
- It's Halloween.
Don't overthink it.
Well, you saw him.
There he is.
Let's get out of here.
I have to meet him, Nick.
I have to.
No, you don't have to meet him.
No, no, no You're a great kid, Sch You're a great kid, Schmidt.
No.
Let me take you out to eat.
I want to buy you something - 'cause you met your hero.
- Go to an all-night diner.
- No, I have to meet Got to meet him.
- He's got to - It's Michael Keaton!
- Go get a blintz or two!
Aah!
- Michael!
It's me Schmidt.
- See you later, Michael!
Take off!
We have so much to talk about.
Our heroes are never who we want them to be!
Oh.
Oh.
You met him.
It's Keaton.
Come on, you guys.
I know.
I've known the whole time.
What, do you think I'm stupid?
No.
It just I Just don't really know what to say in this situation.
Look, please don't blame Nick.
It's not his fault.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
How dare you hack into the private e-mail account of one of our nation's finest actors!
I'm gonna have to tell Michael about this.
No!
No!
- No, don't tell Michael!
- Jess, please stop.
Thank you for what you're trying to do, but it's over.
It has to be over.
Schmidt, I'm Michael Keaton.
I'm the owner of the e-mail address KeatonPotatoes@aol.com.
What?
It was me The whole time.
No - No, you can't - How do you think I know that you kissed the bus driver at spring break?
Or that you want to open up a glassware boutique in Connecticut?
- Or about the wall hole?
- This is impossible!
I've been I've been writing with Michael Keaton since I was a kid!
Your mother came up with the idea, Schmidt.
- But since college, it's been me.
- My mom?
You're gonna tell me that my mom helped me with my public erections?
I drew pictures!
He didn't want you to find out this way.
Hey.
- I got to go.
- Wait.
Schmidt!
- Oh!
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.
Uh - A bully!
Get him!
Oh!
Oh!
- Come on.
- Hey, kids, get out of here!
Scat!
Scat!
Back off!
Cece, wait.
I swear, I did not know he was gonna be here.
I'm so sorry.
No, Jess.
It's-it's fine.
Okay, it's fine.
In fact it's actually kind of perfect.
I think, since this whole thing went down, I've just been running away.
You know, I mean, actually seeing Schmidt, I I finally feel like I have some closure.
Well, good.
I'm glad.
You deserve some.
So let's fire up the Batman Mobile, go to a taco stand and eat some feelings, okay?
Okay, I just I think it's Batmobile.
Batman Mobile.
No.
Batmobile.
That's what I said Batman Mobile.
You're putting the man There's no man.
It's just Bat - Batman Mobile.
- Mobile.
Batman Mobile.
- Batmobile.
Drop the man.
- Bat Yeah.
Batman Mobile.
Batmobile.
Batmo-mobile.
So it was you who helped me through my first breakup with Elizabeth?
Yeah, Schmidt.
And it was you, not Keaton, who told me that women aren't attracted to men who wear maternity pants?
Yes, but that one I feel like I shouldn't have had to.
They're unbelevably comfortable.
What about that time that we saw Michael Keaton at that deli, and he stopped, and he winked?
Honestly, I can't explain that one.
It was just the weirdest day of my whole life.
My friend Michael.
Oh, Schmidt, look, I know this is hard, okay?
But honestly, I was just trying to help.
You don't need Keaton.
You got me.
- What was that?
- I'm so sorry.
What Why would you say something like that?
Because I hurt you, and I've been wanting to fix this for years.
The end of a high school football movie?
I'm really sorry I pretended to be Keaton for the last 12 years.
It's super weird.
Are we good?
Yeah.
We're good.
Well, Nicholas, I came to a decision last night.
I'm entering a new chapter in my life, and I think it best that I do it alone.
You're going to one of those weekend spas again, buddy?
No.
In the famous words of singer-songwriter Billy Joel - Don't do this.
- I'm moving out.
You're the worst.
Schmidt, I thought you said we were good.
No, we're great, but I'm going.
Two separate things.
I made the call this morning.
I got a new place.
I'm out.
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'm going.
Goodness, uh, I think somebody had sex in my bedroom last night.
I think that because they're still in there - Having sex, I think.
- Ugh!
Hey, Schmidt.
You going to a weekend spa again?
- No.
Striking out on my own.
- Wait.
What?
!
You're moving out?
He's not moving out, is he?
Schmidt, you can't move out.
Who's gonna do my fades?
Yeah, who's gonna do his fades?
Believe this is mine.
Well, I bid you all adieu.
- Stop it, Schmidt.
Oh, Schmidt!
- Are you serious?
- Schmidt, come on.
- Come on.
- Seriously?
Come on!
- Stop with the show!
You can't even fit all your socks in that suitcase.
Get your last looks, 'cause who knows when we'll see each other again?
Or where.
Wait.
You're just moving in across the hall?
I can't hear you 'cause I'm gone.
Schmidt, it would take me longer to walk from the kitchen to the bathroom than it would from here to where you are.
Oh, you are kidding me.
- I can see your feet!
- Me, too.
Shut up.
Guy's an idiot See you tomorrow, Schmidt Woo!
I'm alone!
I'm alone!
I'm alone I'm alone Score, touchd Hahaha Yeah.
Shut up, Winston.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Oh!
It's Coach!
Coach, our old roommate?
He wants to hang out tonight.
- What?
- He just texted me.
Oh, man, you better give Power of Attorney to a loved one, 'cause it's about to get crazy.
When Coach has the dice, every roll's a seven.
Here I am Rock you like a hurricane Nick, trumpet solo.
Yeah!
You're ruining my wedding!
You know, I bet this means he broke up with Malia.
I mean, that's his thing.
He finds a girl, he just disappears.
Holy crap in a hat!
Schmidt!
How long have you been out there?
Oh, relax.
Just bringing my chimes over to the new loft.
Damn it, Schmidt!
You're here all the time taking our stuff.
You decided to move out, so get new stuff.
Oh, I'm sorry that I'm more into material possessions than you.
Schmidt, you stole my toothpaste while I was using it.
That's vindictive.
- That's who took the toothpaste?
- Yeah.
Uh-oh, you better watch out, break of, break of dawn, because I'm about to party all up in you!
- Coach texted you, too?
- Yeah, man.
Well, I guess he doesn't realize you're a dill weed who doesn't live here anymore.
Well, I guess he doesn't realize that you're a dill weed who who still lives here.
Remember when you got those chimes, and there was that girl?
Yeah.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
I don't get it.
I had so much sex on patio furniture.
- A lot of fun.
- The best.
- I'm still mad at you.
- I'm mad at you, man!
I need everyone to shut up and answer one simple question!
You sons a bitches ready to party?
Yeah!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Good to have you back, old man.
So, what, uh, you and Malia broke up?
Oh, yeah.
She got real fat on me, so I was, like, "Ew.
Bye".
I guess her gain is our gain!
Who are you?
- Hey, come Come on, man.
- It's me, Jess.
Ah, yeah, no.
We lived together for, like, two weeks.
We shared some pretty big moments.
- Yes!
We got Bin Laden!
- SEAL Team 6, bitches!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Huh.
I thought I was alone for that.
- You weren't.
- Anyway, I'm single, and me and my boys are gonna get crazy tonight!
Huh?
You know what I'm talking about, Shrimp Forks.
- Oh, man.
- Oh, no.
What's Shrimp Forks?
It's a name I gave Winston when we played hoops.
The ball used to always slip through his little, small girly hands.
Winston Bishop, point guard Winston Bishop, point guard, R Point guard, R He couldn't palm an apple.
Old Shrimp Forks.
So, I'm thinking strip club tonight?
- Hmm?
- Oh, fun, fun!
Fun!
Fun!
Uh, Nick, can I talk to you in the other room alone for a sec?
Should I close the door, or do you want to just do it quietly?
We're not having sex, Nick.
No, I know that.
- You wanted to come here and talk.
- Yeah.
A strip club on a Tuesday night?
No, I know, I know, but this is just what we always used to do.
I don't want to be one of those girls, but I feel kind of uncomfortable about it.
- I totally get it.
- Let's go, Nick.
These dollar bills aren't gonna stick themselves in a thong.
I'm coming, my man.
Right on.
I might I might be coming, my man.
- Oh, I get it.
You're whipped.
- No, I'm not.
I know you had to check in with your girlfriend.
We haven't even discussed the girlfriend-boyfriend thing.
Oh, cool, man.
Let's go.
What?
What a - I'm sorry, what did I just hear?
- What I All I said was we haven't had the girlfriend-boyfriend discussion, which we haven't.
You don't think you're my boyfriend?
No, I never said that.
I'm just talking terminology.
We've never had the terminology.
- We've never had the terminology.
- What?
We've never used the terminology.
It's funny you act like you're my boyfriend, you have all the "privileges" of being my boyfriend.
I enjoy them.
Would like me to revoke those privileges?
No, you're twisting my words.
What I'm saying, Jess, is we've never had the boyfriend-girlfriend, seeing other people conversation.
We haven't had the seeing other people conversation?
You're seeing other people?
No, I'm not.
Are you?
- No.
- Jess, I'm just We haven't had the conversation is all, and it's a conversation that I, personally, would love to have.
Uh, dude, let's go.
It's gonna close.
Geez, is she not letting you go?
I'm just telling her what kind of cake to bake me, son.
Oh.
Damn!
That's right.
All right.
What are you doing?
!
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?
!
Jess, it's when Coach is here, - I just - No.
Nick!
- I'm really sorry.
- Guess what, Nick?
I'm going out tonight because we haven't had the boyfriend-girlfriend talk, and we haven't had the seeing other people talk, and I'm gonna bake a cake, a pineapple upside down cake.
- In terms of the metaphor, I'm really - Don't!
Go to the strip club, Nick.
Knock yourself out.
Oh, don't wait up, Jebecca.
Yeah, it's Jess.
Right on.
Men suck.
- Nick isn't even a man.
- Mm-mm.
He's like some man-boy, man-child hybrid.
The other day, I had to tell him not to pull a dog's tail.
I shouldn't have to do that.
If a guy wants to play games, Jess, you got to play them right back.
- Right, good.
- Yeah.
What does that mean?
- I'd make him jealous.
- Yeah, right, yeah.
And there are a lot of guys out there that want to hook up with you.
There is this one guy, Artie, from the coffee shop who asked me out.
Oh, actually, you have my number.
So give me a call.
Maybe we can go out sometime.
Shut your face!
You should maybe give this guy, Artie, a call and see No, that's too real.
That's just way too real.
Then why do you have his number in your phone?
I just like looking at it.
It's not weird.
- No.
- But it has, like a lot of fours in it.
You know, you know what I mean?
No, I don't.
Oh, which one of y'all want a lap dance, because WB just hit the ATM.
- Oh, hold up.
- Mm-hmm.
Shrimp Forks, why'd you get so much Bunny Money?
What is Bunny Money?
That is Bunny Money.
That's not real money.
Look at the bill.
President Rabbit with two big ass jugs.
Damn, man.
It's fine.
As long as you didn't take out too much, you're okay.
Hey, Schmidt, I took out $2,000.
You keep making mistakes, Winston.
Oh, isn't this great, guy?
- Awesome.
- Yeah, man, the best.
And it's gonna keep getting better, because we're not leaving here until the sun comes up.
- Whew.
- Hey, yo, brick top!
We about to get it popping.
Whistle while you twerk!
That man has so much confidence.
It's amazing.
Until the morning?
I can't do this, Schmidt.
I'm having anxiety here.
I have an 8:00 a.m. presentation.
That means I have to get there at 7:45 to lower everyone's chairs.
Jess hasn't texted me back.
I'm starting to freak out.
Here's what I think we should do.
I think you should be the one to just kind of tell him that we want to leave and that maybe you want to leave and then we'll all go together.
Why do I have to be the heavy?
All right, fellas!
All right, he's back!
So I got dancers for each of us, plus one floater to play the zone.
Oh, defense!
- Yeah!
- Here's a crazy idea.
- Shoot, man.
- What if we got out of here, went back to the loft and just hung out?
You're going through a big breakup.
Let's talk it out, man.
Yeah, yeah, let's just, um, go home and talk feelings.
- No.
- Mm-mm.
I was with Malia, now I'm not.
There, we talked about it.
Oh, look at the time.
It's butt o'clock.
- You whipped.
- Shut up, Schmidt.
- You whipped.
- Straight-up whipped.
I'm not whipped.
- Whipped like cream cheese.
- Yeah, you are.
- Whipped like cream cheese.
- Whipped!
So, Cece, I'm thinking of firing off this text to Nick.
"Loving single life".
Should I add a "whoo-hoo" or is that too bitchy?
Look who I called.
Hey, Jess.
Shut your face.
What?
Oh, looks like you could use a new drink.
Barkeep, can I please get a Shirley Temple with a finger of coconut rum and a lemon squeeze?
I call it a Temple Grandin because it makes friendly and compassionate.
I have a boyfriend.
No, she No, she doesn't.
Yeah, I do.
She do.
- No.
- Obviously, this is a bad time, and, uh, you're involved.
In some shape or other.
No, no, no.
She's free as a bird.
- Cece.
- All right, well, he's a very lucky man.
I hope he realizes that.
Oh, don't move.
You've got an eyelash.
There we go.
Make a wish.
I'm afraid to.
All right, take care.
Big mistake.
I shook his hand.
I had my fun.
Do you think that Nick is in the strip club right now shaking hands?
No.
Because he is a man.
You can't trust them, Jess.
Okay?
The moment you let your guard down, they just walk all over you.
Tonight is the night to beat them at their own game.
Hey, Artie!
Bet you can't lift me!
Uh, all sales of Bunny Money are final.
How am I supposed to spend $2,000 on dancers?
Oh, no.
Our dancers don't take it.
- What?
- However, uh, Bunny Money is redeemable at the bar, our gift shop and our sister club in Fort Myers, Florida.
What?
!
Body shot.
You taste delicious, do you know that?
What is that?
An aftertaste?
- Probably baby formula.
- Oh Tuesday nights!
Girl, you are a pistol.
I'll tell you what, how 'bout you and me go back and I dance on you this time?
Oh, man.
Tuesdays nights.
You know, for a chub, you're a terrible heavy.
Let's just get Coach really drunk until he passes out.
Then we take him home.
Shot contest.
Like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schmidt.
I'm not ripping a page from that pro-Nazi film.
It isn't pro-Nazi.
Of course it is.
It might as well be an SS propaganda movie.
No, everybody in a Nazi uniform literally dies.
Yeah, the When she puts the hand - into the, uh - The heart.
No, not Well, that happens, too.
Nazis.
I don't think that makes you a Nazi.
They ate the monkey brains, and there was all the bugs.
Nazi, Nazi.
Nick's at a strip club, but he's just being a normal guy in his 20s that wants to hang out with other guys in their 20s.
They're all in their 30s.
- Hmm.
- Yeah.
Enough about Nick.
What do you do when you're not making coffee at the coffee shop?
- Well, actually, I own the coffee shop.
- What?
It's not as glamorous as you may think.
It's a lot of spreadsheets and jetting off to Brazil at a moment's notice.
Nick's never been to Brazil.
Maybe you should step away.
You know, call Nick up and hash things out.
Hmm-mm, can't call Nick 'cause then he'll know I'm thinking about him.
- Ah.
- And then he wins.
Maybe you both win.
Say Brazil again.
Brazil.
Say "rubber baby buggy bumpers".
Rubber babby buggy bumpers.
Oh, my God!
Shot contest isn't working.
It's only making him stronger.
It's Jess.
Hey, Jess, I'm so glad you called!
Nick, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh, is that, uh, Notorious N.A.G.?
- Hey!
- Is that Naggie Gyllenhaal?
Hey, I don't need your help checking my woman.
You're checking your woman?
Wait, how did you hear that?
You were covering the listening part, dummy.
Yeah, but they look the same.
I'm too drunk.
Well, I'm way drunk, too, and I'm with a man.
What?
He owns a business, and he goes to Brazil.
- Nick?
- Oh, it's a coin flip.
Hello?
He's so immature.
Jess!
Jess, I got it.
Hey, I think you guys have had enough.
Why don't you let me give you a ride home?
Wait, you weren't drinking?
Oh, no, no, no, I don't drink.
I got to get a jump on the morning.
Well, you really have it together.
I bet you can use a phone, too.
Your bar for having it together is set pretty low.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
- We can just grab a cab home.
- Cece, this was your idea.
Artie, can we take your jet?
Oh, it's just one coffee shop.
Wouldn't you like to know?
All right, guys, give it up for Candy!
Is that lobster gray?
Most expensive thing on the menu.
I got to go.
What?
Jess is drinking and talking to some guy.
Forget her, dude.
Relationships are prisons.
How often do we get to hang out like this?
I haven't seen you in two years.
Strippers and booze forever.
- Hear, hear.
- There it is.
No, stop, no, no.
Relationships are not prisons, and Jess is amazing.
She's sexy and sweet, and I can't lose her.
So I'm going home to see her.
Why are you crying?
We can see each other tomorrow.
I didn't break up with Malia, all right?
- She broke up with me.
- Why didn't you say anything, man?
'Cause I was embarrassed, Winston.
I lost her.
I was just trying to fill a void with all these naked chicks.
I don't want to be here.
I want to be in love.
Oh, Coach, this is so pathetic.
Now she's dating some dude named Derrique.
Or Derek.
Coach, you need to go home, and I need to go home, too.
You're right, man.
You have to fight for your relationships.
- Freaking Derrique.
- Let's go.
Mm-mmm, guys, guys, you cannot leave.
Dude, I was just crying.
I want to get out of here.
It's embarrassing.
He cried in a strip club.
All the dudes saw me cry.
Dude, I want to leave.
Man, I got Bunny Money coming out of my pockets.
Wait a minute, this ain't the way home.
Yeah, we're just gonna make a quick stop.
We're gonna kick Malia's boyfriend's ass.
Wait, this is a police station?
Uh-huh, that's where he works.
You want to drunk fight a cop?
He stole my girlfriend.
Did you hear the joke about the two black guys and two white guys who walked into a police station?
- The two white guys came out.
- I'm with Winston.
- Winston?
- Mm-hmm?
I got two of these, and you got one more of those.
- Put that away.
- Coach!
Coach, let's do it.
- Coach, no!
- Let's get raucous.
- I'm ready.
- We're not ready!
- He is pure life force.
- He's a lunatic, man.
I got to get out of here.
I want to go, too.
I got a work thing.
- Well, I got a girl thing, dude.
- Work trumps girls.
Girls are replaceable.
Jobs are forever.
I bet I get left with the fare.
I just bet Hey, driver, let me just ask you something.
Do you like strippers?
Do you also like the deal of a lifetime?
I wanted to leave first.
I've been saying that the whole night, and none of you guys can stop me.
You think that you can you can beat me in a physical altercation of fisticuffs?
I will beat you in a way that you've never been beaten before.
Ooh.
Damn it!
You got hit in the face, son.
Hit me again.
'Cause I swear you'll be I'll be Loosen up your neck so I can put you into the headlock of a lifetime.
Guys, it's escalating, look!
I'm a cop, pew, pew, pew.
No, no, no, no, no.
Thanks for the ride, Artie.
Bathroom's down the hall.
It's the one with the urinals.
I do live with men.
Nay, boys.
Look, if he can pee in Brazil, he can pee at my house.
- Do you actually like this guy?
- What?
No, no.
Nick couldn't call me his girlfriend, and that hurt.
Now I want to hurt him back with some long, hot conversation.
- That's what you really want to do?
- Yes.
Men suck, remember?
I'm sorry about saying that, because I put that on you, all right?
That's because I'm going through something right now with Schmidt.
- You have Nick.
- Nick's a child who drinks on Tuesdays.
You're drinking on a Tuesday and you are a teacher.
Those kids are watching a movie tomorrow.
Look, Nick doesn't have a life plan.
He doesn't have a day plan.
I once found a note he wrote to himself that said "Put on pants" followed by a question mark.
That means it read, "Put on pants"?
Also, he throws pizza at seagulls, which I guess is kind of nice because he's trying to feed them.
And he's a really, really great kisser.
You have something really good.
Just go get Artie and tell him to leave, all right?
Can you just get Derek?
!
Hey!
Hey!
He's gonna get the whole precinct!
This is a high-income area.
They're very bored in there.
Oh, my goodness, this jacket smells like gasoline.
Guys, come on.
Come on, man, we're too old for this.
- We're too old for this whole night.
- What?
Life changes.
You got to grow up.
I did.
I'm in a relationship, and I'm happy.
Schmidt moved out of the loft, and he's happy.
I'm miserable!
- It's your fault.
- What are you talking about?
I'm in a vacancy room!
- A room of vacancy!
Empty nest!
- By choice!
By choice!
Let me tell you something, when I'm done with you, your face is gonna look all melted like the president at the end of Raiders.
He wasn't a president!
You saw a different movie - than everybody else in the world!
- I'll kill you!
- He wasn't a president.
- Guys, guys!
Kick you in the butt!
- Don't!
You touched my penis!
- Hey, hey!
Don't touch my penis!
Stop!
Stop it!
- You just touched my penis!
- Hey!
Hey!
You touched my You guys, grow up!
- You grow up.
Grow up!
- Coach?
What are you doing here?
- Is this about Malia?
- Yeah, it's about Malia.
Take care of her, man.
Yeah, I will.
I'm a cop, not some drunk loser.
Get out of here.
Should we grow up tomorrow night?
Yeah.
Muscle time!
- Get on the ground!
- Muscle time!
- I'm a cop!
- Back up!
- I got a badge and a gun!
- Arrest me, dude!
He's got backup!
Go!
Go!
- Go!
Go!
- Go!
Serpentine!
Serpentine!
Artie, I have to hit the hay.
Oh, dear!
Don't worry.
I'm gonna make you coffee in the morning.
It's been a really great evening, what a treat it's been, but I think somewhere along the way, some signals got crossed.
Signals could not have been any clearer.
Come on in.
The water's warm.
Are you splashing me?
I'm fixing to mix you up.
Seriously?
Oh, men are such dicks.
All right, guys, second wind.
You got an old TV?
Let's throw it off the roof.
Come on, you're crashing with me.
And you, go talk to your girlfriend.
Thanks.
Hey, it was a fun night.
All right, guys.
Let's go, Shrimp Forks.
Coach, Shrimp Forks?
Come on, man, that makes no sense.
I played professional basketball.
You got to stop calling me that.
I'm sorry, man.
Hop along, Bunny Money.
Better than Shrimp Forks.
- I'll take that.
- Fantastic.
It only cost you $2,000.
It did, didn't it?
The Brazilians have the same word for making love to one woman as they do for making love to two.
Mah-gaa-leesh.
Take off your tops and say it with me.
Jess!
Oh, my God, that's Nick!
Okay, okay, you-you just get him dressed.
I will stall Nick.
I am really good at this kind of thing.
Oh, my God.
Nick, hey, great.
I've been wanting to talk to you about this side table.
What kind of wood is it made out of?
Jess, I failed!
Jess.
Welcome, brother.
Oh, my God.
Nick, I can't imagine what you must be thinking right now.
Actually, I can.
This is your worst nightmare.
There's a very good-looking man in my bed, and he's naked, and I'm flushed, and I'm flustered.
I might as well just spray paint "Jay Cutler sucks" on the wall and just round out the whole image, right?
But, Nick, nothing happened, and nothing was ever going to happen, and you have to believe me, please.
Say you believe me, please.
I believe you.
Do you have any questions?
Do you want me to have questions?
Well Hey, Artie?
I'm gonna need you to get out of my girlfriend's bed, man.
Well, uh, I'm naked and-and in bed, and you're fully clothed and standing, so I mean, I hardly think this would be a fair fight.
Well, I'd like it to be a fair fight.
Thank God for snaps.
Men are so weird.
I must warn you, while spending time in Brazil Let get situated first before we get into this thing.
Oh, my God!
- Bye-bye.
- Don't die, big guy.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You called me your girlfriend.
Did I?
I don't remember.
Where's Winston with the food?
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It was crazy at the V-Rab.
Bachelor party season.
- I got a deep-dish gyrator, no mushrooms.
- That's me.
Don't call it V-Rab.
Please.
I got the main stage fish tacos.
- No regrets.
- Great order.
Pour some sugar on meatballs?
- Oh, that's me.
- Thank you.
Let's see, and I got the short stack ass-clap pancakes.
You want to switch?
- Schmidt, you want a taco?
- No, I'm gonna take one of Winston's.
- Take it if you want it, dude.
- I was just thinking maybe-maybe you guys could chip in a little bit.
- 'Cause it was expensive.
- You want one of Winston's tacos?
I'll take 50 cents on the dollar, I really would.
I really would.
Please?
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Ah, Hop Foo's, my favorite.
Don't mind if I brunch.
- Are you eating takeout for breakfast?
- Hey, you're my girlfriend now.
You're not supposed to judge anything I do.
- Say that again.
- You're my girlfriend now.
I like it.
Even when you have dumpling in your mouth.
Sounds good.
I have to go.
I have a big meeting with Principal Foster today.
I hate that guy.
He always says no to your ideas.
No, no, no.
Not this one.
This one is, uh, Ocean Conservation Day.
Why do you do this to yourself, Jess?
So you're telling me to not even try?
I just don't want you to be disappointed when he says no.
Look, maybe you should try to try a little less.
- How am I supposed to try to not try?
- That's a catch-22.
- Oh, hey, Coach.
- Oh, I dropped a dumpling!
- That his breakfast?
- Yeah.
Isn't it cute?
- He's not even ashamed of it.
- Oh I got it!
It almost got away from me Aah!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Look, Principal Foster, we have the chance to do something really great.
Everything's been donated.
All we need are transportation costs.
Come on!
That's only the most expensive part of doing anything!
You I'm sorry.
That was rude.
I slept very badly last night.
Had a chai tea very late.
Had friends in from Montreal.
Some of these kids have lived in L.A. their entire lives and they've never even seen the ocean.
Last week I asked them to draw what they thought the ocean looked like.
I got a lot of stuff like this.
Is that a bagel with wings?
- Yes, sir, it is.
- Extraordinary.
I'm afraid I'm not taking no for an answer.
You're gonna have to take no for an answer because that's just the way it is.
Hmm, a shark with legs.
That's not even anatomically close to correct.
That's just a square, though.
Have them start over.
That's just terrible.
Nick?
I want to talk to you about your fitness level.
- Of what?
My body?
- When's the last time you worked out?
You know what?
I'll tell you when the last time he worked out was.
It was the time that he battled his daddy's other dumb sperm in order to make his way to his mama's dumb-ass egg.
Your burns are getting better, man.
- Just really long.
- Okay.
Look, I don't need to work out.
I'm old-fashioned, Coney Island fat-strong.
Ah, Nicholas.
Chinese food for breakfast.
See you're still a health nut.
- Aren't you supposed to be at work?
- I'm rocking a PD personal day.
Yeah, last day of the move.
Coach, I see you've wasted no time moving into my old room.
Anyway, I just came over to, uh, drop off my old key.
Wow, so this is like a moment.
Looking to get some much-needed space from this place.
- You're right across the hall.
- That's true.
Everywhere you go There you are.
- What?
- What?
- His jeans are so small.
- He looks like a little puppet.
Like something some Italian whittled.
- Come on, man, just let me train you.
- You know what, Nick?
You should do it.
I would love for Coach to train me, but I kind of pushed it too hard at the court yesterday.
Went in for a dunk.
Landed sort of funny.
Typical Winston.
- That's true.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Because you're always too injured to play.
Remember when you sat out of the game because you were sad?
I was also cold.
Nick.
Let's do this.
Look at me.
Now, you're in a new relationship, which puts you at risk for gaining the boyfriend 15.
- That's not a thing.
- It is a thing.
Jess is into this.
I've seen this happen a million times.
The boyfriend 15 quickly turns into the boyfriend 20.
Next thing you know, you're a fat dude on a little bike with a cowboy hat on talking about, "My ass hurts".
- I don't want to be that.
- I don't want you to be that.
I would just be riding around in circles or would I be going places?
Circles, dude.
Fat-guy rash on your arm.
Okay, look, Schmidt's tried to get me to work out for years.
It didn't take.
Also, and it's not an excuse, I have a very bad back.
- Your bad back?
- Yeah.
You gave me a piggyback ride two days ago and you giggled the whole time.
It was awesome.
- It was also really funny.
- That was pretty funny.
- We took the stairs, dude.
- Yeah.
- It's 'cause I was excited.
- Nick.
Either take this dumpling and be a dumpling guy, or you train with me, and be a do-ing guy.
It's hard because I've been a dumpling guy my whole life I know.
One day, that's all I need.
And I will change your life.
You'll be able to see your abs.
I thought God just didn't give me those.
Come on.
Let's do it.
- My man!
- I'm in!
I'm gonna warn you.
Working out is not my thing.
Not worried, man.
I do not fail.
You know what?
I'm in, too.
You're injured, you shouldn't, you shouldn't do it.
What?
Come on, Winnie the Bish play through the pain, baby.
You know what?
Let's warm up with some jumping jacks.
I was going Oh!
Miss Day!
Check out my cool beach hat.
Unfortunately, um, I have some bad news.
Uh, we're not gonna get to go on that field trip.
But you said anything is possible, Miss Day.
You just keep wearing that hat, Crystal.
Because as long as hot dogs are hats Anything is possible.
You could be the first little girl in space.
You just ride that hot dog hat all the way to the moon, girl.
Oh, Crystal, you're not legally allowed to touch me.
But thank you.
Hey, guess who got a trainer.
- So many menus.
- I'm gonna look like Barry Bonds.
- Seriously, what the hell?
- Hey.
I take it, it didn't go well with Foster.
- It did not go well.
- Aw, Jess.
- I hate seeing you hurt like this.
- Are you serious?
More menus?
This is like Why do we need more menus?
- Don't we have enough menus?
- Feels like you're saying menus a lot.
This is an eco-disaster.
Conservation deserves a win today.
Hop Foo's has killed its last tree.
Jess, this feels like a something-else-is-going-on type of thing.
Are you okay to drive?
You got crazy eye!
Uh, welcome to Hop Foo's.
Can I help you?
This morning, there were nine menus just in my apartment.
I also hate those menus, they're so bad for the environment.
It's wasteful.
It's an eco-disaster.
I'll talk to my boss, see if we can change that.
Yeah, great, you do that.
I'm gonna follow up with you on that.
I compost, recycle, but it's I don't feel like it's enough.
Thank you.
Geez, thank you so much for stepping up and saying something.
That's who I am, that's just, you know, I'm - My name's Brian.
- Jess.
Jessica.
Jess.
It's really refreshing to meet someone who actually cares.
Well, it helps that you're gorgeous.
No, that's crazy.
That ain't real.
That's dumb.
That's straight dumb.
You're dumb.
You're nice.
You excited for the holidays?
I am.
Hmm.
Anyway - My system is built to be easy.
- Okay.
It's easy as peanuts.
- Easy as peanuts?
- Yeah.
That's not an expression; no one says that.
PEANUTS is an acronym.
PEANUTS stands for: Physical Education Activity Nuts!
Like, like go nuts, have fun!
Yeah, but you got to use every letter.
I'm aware of that, but it still works.
- Yo.
Yo.
- Hey.
What's going on, guys?
Let's do this.
I tell you, ain't no injury gonna hold Old Winnie the Bish down, 'cause I'm a warrior.
Nick knows.
Burpies?
All right, cool.
- Injury is gonna get worse.
- I'm not a quitter!
Hey, Schmidt, what's going on, man?
Everything okay?
Did I leave my Oakland Raiders yarmulke over there?
Don't know.
Coach and I are working out.
I've been trying to get you to work out for years.
- Well, just come over, man.
- I'm enjoying my space.
But maybe you should just put me on speaker.
- Okay, you're on.
- Okay, cool, set the scene.
- What's the vibe over there?
- Nick's in jeans.
Nixon jeans?
What the hell are Nixon jeans?
They sound really cool.
Hey, I solved the menu thing.
I just went down there, I took action.
I made a change.
Now that I can do that, I really feel like I can figure out this field trip thing.
Double boom-yah.
There are still some things we need to figure out.
Just got to get the message across.
Hey, hey, you don't, you don't need to leave these anymore.
Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you running to?
Who sent you?
Brian, I thought you were gonna talk to your boss.
- I am the boss.
- Hop Foo's is your restaurant?
Sorry I lied.
You just seemed kind of crazy, so I didn't want to deal.
But you care about conservation.
Oh, I don't, I really don't.
I care about my restaurant.
You're going down, Brian!
I'm gonna collect signatures, I'm gonna start a petition, and I will turn it in to the person who's in charge of restaurants.
And I'm gonna report you to the City!
Oh, no, not the City.
No!
You're a jerk, Brian!
I'm gonna burn down your building!
I won't do that, I won't do that.
Why do people suck?
!
Okay, we're gonna warm up with music.
- Yeah, feeling that?
- I guess so.
Yeah, got to loosen up the shoulders.
Wiggle those arms.
- Arms, not your face.
- Oh, sorry, thought you said "face".
Right.
- Sexy.
Working out is sexy.
- Yeah, it is.
That's not sexy, man.
This is sexy.
That isn't sexy.
Damn it!
It's a great workout track!
What's next?
And time.
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
Let's do it again.
- Again?
- Yeah, man.
Six, seven, eight.
Come on, man!
Mine's broken.
Push through it, man, you got it.
- Ah, thank God you're here, Cece.
- What's the emergency?
Why does Jess need all this Chinese food?
No, no, no, I just made all that up.
Wait, you tricked me into getting you food?
Yes.
Why?
- Nick, what is this?
- For after don't worry about it.
I will be right back.
Hello zere.
- I'm, I'm Cece, I-I remember you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, great memory.
That's what's up, that's what's up.
No doubt.
Diggity.
- Nick!
- Breasts Ni This is for the food, and there's a little extra for you.
- Oh, my God, are you tipping me?
- Yeah.
Well, if I'm gonna get in trouble, give it back.
I gave you four bucks.
I'll tip you good I'll tip you right over.
- Good stuff.
- Yeah, yeah.
Damn, I wish I could have said something else.
- "Tip you right over" was good.
- Oh, okay, cool.
Uh, is she single?
- Yeah, kind of.
- Oh, cool, man.
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just gonna it's just a protein boost.
I'm just gonna eat a little.
That's not how it works, dude.
We're still in the middle of our workout.
- We're not done yet?
- No!
Hey, whoa.
I just had a very productive conversation with the owner of the restaurant.
Action has been taken, change is in the air.
Now I'm going to go research lawsuits in my room for fun.
- You okay?
You seem a little off.
- Stop ordering from that place.
Nick, put the dumpling down.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up, Jason Street?
The Internet said that I had to stay off my feet, but then I found this wheelchair in a ditch, so I'm ready to work out.
Winston, go lay down.
Nick, put the dumpling down.
- Relax.
- Whoops.
Did you just gasp?
- I'm having one - Down.
I'm gonna ask you again.
Don't Don't do it.
Don't.
D I'm going to eat one bite of this.
Don't do it.
You're better than this.
I don't know if I am.
I might..
No.
- Don't, don't.
- Stop shaking it like that.
- Let me eat the dumpling!
- What's going on?
- Oh, just working out.
- Yeah.
Just chilling.
- Does this food have MSG in it?
- What?
Oh, my God, MSG makes my jaw lock up.
You all right, dude?
- What?
- Mm-hmm.
- What's going on with your jaw?
- Yeah, dude.
Come on, you son of a Wait a minute.
Ha, "no MSG".
Where are you going?
- I'm just taking Winston for a walk.
- Where are you taking me?
- I think he needs some fresh air.
- Aah!
Damn it, Coach.
Nick!
I want you to really think about your next step.
- Why do you care so much?
- This is a crucial moment, a crossroads.
By you eating that, you are telling me that you'd rather sit on the couch eating dumplings than do something with your life.
Now, are you a doer or a dumpling-er?
I'm sorry, I'm not you, man.
I'm a dumpling-er.
Mmm.
Oh, it's veggie.
I did all that for nothing?
I tried.
- Where are you taking me?
- What?
You're my smoking gun.
Winston's in a wheelchair?
What's next, Roberto Benigni coming through the halls, making everybody laugh?
Missing everything.
Take these.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Don't even talk.
My friend is having an allergic reaction to your food.
- Hey, man.
- It says "no MSG" on the menu.
It also says it with the what do you call the circle with the diagonal line?
- It's the Ghostbusters thing.
- What?
From the movie Ghostbusters.
Oh, it says it with words an it says it with the Ghostbusters thing.
- All right, just calm down.
- No, here's what's going to happen.
You're going to stop putting these menus everywhere, or I'm going to show the people in here what happens when you eat the food.
- I actually like the food.
- Listen, Jess, Chinese food is MSG.
America is living a lie, and we distribute menus so people order the food.
Just accept that that's the way things are!
No, I am done accepting things the way they are, because there are menus everywhere, and there are kids who want to see the ocean.
- What?
- And I don't like your vibe, dude.
Hey!
This is what eating here did to my friend.
Is that crispy noodles?
Coach.
Oh, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- I'm making island beats.
I think this is what I'm gonna do from now on, since, obviously, I can't coach.
I thought we were just messing around.
Why are you taking this so hard?
Because, dude, I was trying to prove to myself that I could still do this.
Ever since Malia broke up with me I don't know I've just been a mess.
Feel like I can't do anything right.
Guys, it's locked, it's unlocked.
Get it together for real.
What are you doing here?
I thought you said you were so busy.
I found this extra alarm clock, and, uh, I thought it'd be neighborly, so I'll set it up for you guys.
You're welcome.
Wait a second.
- What is that?
- What's what?
- Is that a camera?
- Hmm?
Schmidt, are you spying on us?
So It is it's a camera.
- Well, I'm shocked.
- Schmidt, look, you decided to move out.
- So move out.
- I am out.
I'm actually very busy, you know that?
I'm actually late for a very important coffee with a with a dear friend of mine.
- Who's that?
- Hmm?
- Who?
- Yeah.
Wouldn't you like to know?
Tiny pants man He don't have friends That's why he got the clock He got the clock to watch his only friends.
Are you enjoying your meal?
Winston enjoyed his meal, right?
- Until he had an allergic reaction.
- Let's go.
There.
I drove away all of your customers, and I'm gonna do that every day until you stop with the menus.
- Earth warrior!
- You win.
I'll stop.
Thank you.
Charles?
You're fired.
- What?
No!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Don't fire him.
- He's the menu guy.
- I was just trying to make a difference.
You did.
At the beginning of the day, this guy had a job.
Now he doesn't, so congrats on your victory.
You win.
Do you have any teaching experience?
Does anyone have an antihistamine?
You know, I just moved across the hall, but it feels like I moved across an entire ocean.
People grow up, especially young people.
So my friends don't even miss me anymore?
Uh-huh.
Well, they don't miss you.
- They've moved on.
- What?
Well, how do you know that?
Because he told me.
His name is Conner, and he went to SUNY Binghamton.
I once lived with 40 birds, and they all flew away, and I moved on.
Slow down on the noodles, buddy.
Well, congratulations, Miller.
You were right.
- What happened?
- I terrorized a restaurant.
I got a good man fired.
I might have ran over a lizard with my wheelchair, but I am ashamed of it.
So, that's what you get for trying.
Let's see what the enemy tastes like.
It's good.
Anybody want to help me use the bathroom?
- No.
No.
- Okay, I'll work it out.
I shouldn't have even tried.
You just get hurt.
This is such a relief.
I can get fat now.
- Hey, guys, stop it!
- I want to eat this all day.
Like a Chinese food mÃ©nage.
Oh!
Okay, you guys are doers, and people like me, people who don't do anything we actually need people like you.
- Mmm - Oh, boy, this is bad.
Uh, this Okay, all right.
I'm gonna give you guys a speech, and it's gonna fire you guys up.
- Got some on my pants - First we're gonna start with compliments to build up your confidence.
Okay, uh, - Coach, you're a great guy.
- Mmm You've got strong bodies.
- Aah!
- What?
You just need some more clients.
I believe in you.
- Thanks.
- Jess, you're awesome.
You are the most resourceful, optimistic, amazing person I've ever met in my life.
I can't even get my kids on a field trip.
You can do anything you put your mind to 'cause you're smart, okay?
Why can't you get 'em on this field trip?
There's no way to get them to the beach.
That's a board.
Karate-kick it!
You're not used to making speeches, are you?
Point of it is, is you never give up.
Fine.
I guess you win.
I sort of miss being here.
Well, the nanny cam kind of gave it away.
Well, nobody helped me, so now there is a real mess.
Hey, Winston, do you have some money where we could rent, like, a car or a bus or something?
I found this wheelchair in a ditch.
Is anyone gonna tell me anything that's going on?
Stop!
If it's not an idea about how to rent a car or a van, then I don't want to hear it!
Wait a minute.
Nick?
That's brilliant!
Boys and girls, transportation provided by Hop Foo's restaurant.
All right, everybody, we did it!
Ocean Conservation Day starts now!
Welcome to the Pacific Ocean!
Yeah.
The large body of water to my left.
No horseplay, guys.
Guys, don't talk to strangers.
And you said it wouldn't fit.
I knew it would fit.
I just didn't want you to bring it.
Careful.
It's got a trick wheel.
- I think it's fine.
- Okay.
- Aah!
Trick wheel.
- Not fine.
Sorry.
Nice wheelchair.
Ms. Day?
- Hey.
- Thank you.
Here.
You deserve this.
Oh, thank you.
I love it.
But you know what?
I think this actually belongs to Nick Miller, 'cause he did this.
Oh, wow!
- Is this your dad?
- How old do you think I am, little girl?
All right.
- I don't want this gift.
- It's her favorite hat.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You made a difference.
How's it feel?
It feels good.
Yeah, actually, it feels great.
I feel like, um I don't know.
I feel like running.
Hey, Coach, you want to show me how?
- How to run?
- Come on.
Coach me!
Is this right, Coach?
Am I doing it right?
Miller, you sorry excuse for a human being, you are shaped like a bean bag chair!
I will sit in you!
- Ah, you can do it.
- I'm coming, too.
'Cause I ain't a quitter!
Ironside!
I'm coming.
I'm com I am all-terrain, baby.
I was wrong about you, okay?
You're not a quitter.
Now, please, quit!
I'm glad I got to see that.
Oh, Schmidt, here's your key back.
We kind of like having you around.
Thanks.
This is just a copy, though.
I have like 50 of them at home.
- What are you doing to me?
- Your students are burying Winston.
Nah, he likes it.
Get away from me!
Where are your parents at?
Shoo, children, shoo!
Away now, be away!
Shut up, Winston!
- They are so mean!
- This is Karma
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Oh, hey.
I was wondering about date night tonight.
Do you wanna just stay in?
'Cause you know what that means.
- Romantic dinner and "Homeland"?
- Sex on the couch.
Or your thing.
- Actually, "Homeland" sounds great.
- Or your thing.
Hey, Nick, um Last night when Ferguson and I were in the shower, I had an epiphany.
It's time to get back in the game.
You know, meet some women.
Human women.
Human?
Is there any other kind?
Anyway, I was wondering if you'd watch Ferguson tonight while I go out for some drinks with some work buddies.
Just for a little while.
You just gotta give him a pill at 6:00.
- We're having date night tonight.
- Jess Winston wants to go out to meet human women.
- Without the cat.
- Oh, yep, yep.
Yep, yep.
Nick will watch the cat.
Question Are those mouth pills or butt pills?
Just one pill.
Just one butt pill.
- Here you are.
- I'm not touching that thing.
No?
Okay.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.
You got it.
Hey, guys.
Just hanging at home tonight?
No, actually, we have a date tonight.
'Cause I just made some cobbler.
Some peach cobbler and slow-churned vanilla bean ice cream, and Coach is asking Cece out on a date tonight, and Does anybody want a bite of this, 'cause it's?
Ho!
Ho!
It's fresh out of the oven.
It's piping hot!
Ha!
Ha!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Well, I hope Coach at least ran this by you first.
Coach came over, he followed the bro code.
Actually went really well.
Yeah.
Just the man I wanted to see.
- You found me.
- Yeah, I did.
I got a question for you, playa.
Drop the bomb, man!
Can I ask Cece out on a date?
Yeah!
Wait, what?
Wait, that's so great for Cece.
Coach is super hot.
Wrong crowd.
I see that now.
Be that as it may, you blew it with Cece, so you have to be fine with this.
- I am.
- You are?
- I promise I am.
- You are?
- 100% fine.
- You're fine?
- Yeah, I'm absolutely fine.
- Really?
It's good for Cece, it's good for Coach, it's good for America.
Who knows?
We might even get another Tiger Woods out of this situation.
Wouldn't that be nice?
I'm probably getting ahead of myself.
Who knows if Cece will even say yes?
She said yes!
We're going to the Staples Center to watch a game tonight.
Are you still Are you cool with this?
Hmm?
I mean, 'cause all you have to do is say the word, man, and I'll back off, for real.
N No, man.
Come on.
Date that thing.
- Yeah!
And then date it again.
- All right.
- It's not gonna date itself.
- Yeah, date it all night long.
I'm kind of nervous!
Yeah, I'm nervous.
Yeah, I'm really nervous.
Um I mean, she's beautiful and she's super cool.
And it's just, like Like, you don't even know.
- I 100% know.
- Yes, you kno You know.
She stopped the wedding because of me, so I'm just saying.
And then I ruined it 'cause I had my own thing.
Malia broke up with me and that kind of, like, threw my head for a loop, so I'm super vulnerable right now.
It's like I don't know.
Think I'm feeling kind of insecure.
Come on.
You're Coach.
- You're the Coach.
- Yeah.
You're the prize.
Remember, you're the prize.
You're the prize.
I'm Coach!
Yeah, you're Coach.
- She doesn't stand a chance!
- Oh, yeah, well She's gonna get it good!
Yeah!
Or you could take it slow!
- Nah, I'm gunning it!
- Oh, oh!
Y-you're gonna gun it.
- I am gunning it.
Yes.
- You're gonna gun it for real?
That first-class ass is sitting in coach tonight.
And best believe, my seat will be in an upright and locked position.
Thanks, Schmidt.
Oh boy.
He's gonna gun it.
I don't know if you heard that, but he said he's going to gun it.
- He's really not fine.
- When he says, "I'm fine," he's about to get un-fine.
Aw, Schmidters.
There's gonna be other open mics.
With sturdier stools.
I'm fine.
I know you're fine.
Then they'll see your rap skills.
Then Hey.
Stop!
You just said you were fine!
You just said you were fine!
Let me die!
I know Schmidt.
He's gonna try and stop that date from happening.
- Okay.
- So the strategy is containment.
- Okay.
- We got to lock him up.
Distract him like a baby.
If he gets out of line, we got to get physical.
We're gonna get physical with a baby?
Please don't question me.
I'm a pro.
Or we could help him move on.
Take him out, get him drunk, maybe meet someone new?
No.
We just got to keep him in a safe place.
- I wish I had that dog cage.
- What?
When you see a dog cage for sale, you buy it.
Hey, Jess, about tonight, I'm so sorry.
We'll have date night when we're marrie - Da, burp a durp a durp.
- What did you just Merry.
When we're very Merry Christmas.
All right, moving on.
Hey, uh I'm having second thoughts about Coach and Cece.
Maybe I should stop their date.
Smarten up!
Thank you.
Um Did you get a chance to get that, uh the dog cage?
- No.
I feel bad.
- You didn't?
- That was the solution.
- I know it was.
Yeah, Jess, so I j I just I just buzzed him up.
I He asked me out on a date, and I said yes.
We're both going through a breakup right now, - which is good, right?
- Totally.
Gun it.
Gun it!
- He's here.
- Don't go past second base.
Okay.
Bye.
- Hey.

Wow.
Uh, y-you look amazing.

Great.
I'm gonna go get some food from the Staples Center.
- Hey, easy.
Chill out.
- Okay.
All right.
You're right, you're right.
Great call.
Hey, Winston.
Hey.
What happened to you?
I thought you were supposed to go to a party.
Yeah, it's been so long that I think I forgot how to talk to women.
You ever wonder if someone in here has killed someone?
Ferguson is his name.
Yeah, he's my cat.
Here's him in a cowboy hat.
Good lord, darling, how big are your feet?
You know what?
It's fine.
I'll be alone my whole life.
You know, Hank Aaron was alone for every home run he hit.
As long as I got Ferguson.
Speaking of which, where is that cat?
Ferguson!
That's strange.
He usually comes when I call him.
Nick, you left the window open?
Oh, my God, no.
- Nick!
- What?
You know he always trying to kick it with those pigeons.
Nick, you let him out.
I did I didn't mean to.
I just opened the window.
Man, I asked you to do one thing!
- Winston, I'm really sorry.
- This is your fault, man!
- I feel terrible, Winston.
- You're gonna help me find him!
Winston, don't leave Winston Okay, I'm coming, buddy.
Jess, I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to stay here and keep an eye on Schmidt.
No!
No, no, no.
You can't leave me here with him.
No, she's right.
You can't do that.
What if it gets rough?
Nick, he is in pain.
I can feel it.
- Don't you go!
- Stay!
I am so scared, man!
What do you want me to do, Jess?
- Stay.
- Everybody settle!
Look, this is my fault.
Winston, I'm coming with you.
Schmidt, just get it together.
Jess, I'm sorry.
Just keep him here and keep his mind off the date.
I have to go.
I'm sorry.
We got to go.
Let's find that damn cat!
What do you think Coach and Cece are doing right now?
- I don't know.
- They probably just sat down.
Touching thighs for the first time.
- I'm gonna go stop that date!
- No!
Is that literally all you have?
Oh, my God, we're screwed.
- Nick!
- Nick!
Uh, think.
Coach gave me an out.
He said, "Just say the word and it's off".
And you know what?
I'm just gonna say the word.
No!
No!
You call, you say the word.
No, Schmidt!
God, you can't do that to Cece.
She's just starting to move on.
All we have to do is get through the night.
Just have to get your mind off her.
What do you want to start with?
Play it now Play it now, my baby Cracklin' Rosie, get on by What's-what's happening?
Maybe just go no shoes.
I don't know.
Okay, and this one's tenth grade, so This one's from Evan G. Evan G. was the captain of the water polo team.
"Hey, Jess, we both like lunch".
That's true.
Oh, lean in Aw, dude Play it now, play it now My baby Cracklin' Rosie, get on board Camryn Manheim represents a woman who was heckled by a carnival clown, and Dylan McDermott says - I can't stop thinking about Cece!
- Okay!
Nick said this would work.
Sit down.
Stop thinking about Cece.
Wow.
Look at this leather.
It's so smooth, brown.
It's just like Cece.
That's weird.
You're right.
I'm just gonna lay down for a little bit.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, this feels good.
Okay.
What are you doing, Schmidt?
- Nothing, just go.
- No, no, no, no.
- Just go away.
- Okay Schmidt, hey.
No!
We're getting you out of here, and we're gonna get you a new woman, okay?
Nick said to stay home.
Well, Nick doesn't know everything, Schmidt.
And please stop this.
This is so disgusting.
I can't even look at you.
Come on, this is gross.
This is getting really weird.
Please!
Just one more kiss!
No, you're kissing a sectional, you dummy!
All right.
That was the right move.
You did good.
- Ferguson!
- Ferguson!
Ferguson!
Come here, buddy!
Come on, you little son of a bitch!
We should do another lap around the park.
I bet those mean-ass kids playing frisbee are gone by now.
Winston We've looked everywhere.
What are you do?
Winston.
Damn it!
I should've never gone to that party.
Nah, the party was a good thing.
- You should go to more parties.
- Really?
I got shot down by, I don't know, And then I come home to find out that you have misplaced my best friend.
- Ferguson's your best friend now?
- Yes!
Would you listen to yourself?
This is pathetic.
- Whoa.
- "Pathetic" is harsh.
- I didn't mean - Friends don't call friends pathetic.
Well, what do friends do when their other friend is taking a shower with a cat?
Wait, wait, wait!
I just got a text.
Somebody found him.
- No way!
Ferguson?
- Yes.
Yes!
Don't do that at all.
If that cat's alive, we're made up.
How you liking that merch?
Oh, it's It's great, thanks.
Yeah, yeah.
- You want a pretzel?
- No, I'm-I'm fine, thanks.
It wasn't a question.
Hey, yo, slice!
Let me get about seven of them hot things!
You worried about the money?
It's cool, I got it, babe.
Coach had a good year today.
Yeah, when I-I agreed to go out with you, this isn't exactly what I expected.
I know, I hear that a lot, I hear that a lot.
Uh-oh!
Ha-ha!
Look at that.
Coach is blowing up.
Oh.
I'll just Thanks.
Damn it.
I can't mingle with this trash.
I've been to the mountaintop.
Okay, look.
Look at me.
You are moving on.
Now, where's the old Schmidt?
When I moved into the loft, you used to pull so many ladies.
You were legendary.
That year, uh, Hurricane Schmidt did-did demolish - a number of beach communities.
- Right.
All right, we're gonna go talk to this girl over here.
She's on a flip phone, Jess.
I mean, she's either poor or a time traveler.
Hi!
This is my friend Schmidt.
And he's sweet and he's smart.
And he has a job that I don't really understand, but seems to pay him well.
- Schmidt, sit down.
- Okay.
I'm gonna give you two a moment.
Look, you're a beautiful woman.
In another life, we certainly would've been lovers, but my soul mate is at a Sparks game right now with another man.
I need to go get her.
- Oh, you poor thing - Please don't interrupt me.
Now, do you see that bug-eyed woman over there?
I need to ditch her so that I can go fulfill my destiny.
Now, tell me when she looks away.
Not now.
Not now.
Wait.
Now.
What might've been.
Hey, Schmidt!
No!
What do you think he's gonna look like when we get him back?
Found him under the steps eating a dead raccoon's eyeball.
Your cat's a psycho.
Oh, did my baby have a tasty treat?
Ferguson, I missed you so much, little buddy.
They're very connected, those two.
I can relate.
Got a beast of my own.
Hodgkiss, wake up.
- We got company.
- Aw.
- Is that a squirrel?
- Squirrel?
It's a hamster.
Nick, you know what a squirrel looks like.
Okay, you've been outside, man.
Trying to just figure out the smell, I guess.
This guy's the best.
I'd rather stay home and watch Grey's with him than go out to some bar, try to impress some douche bag dressed like a lumberjack.
I am done chasing men.
I hear that.
I am so done chasing women.
That's too bad.
Yeah, it's too bad.
You guys hungry?
- Oh, no, but thank you very much - I could eat.
Winston, do you like bologna?
It's the kind you have to peel the wrapper off just to get to the meat.
And do you have pudding in a cup?
I never have pudding in a cup.
No.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing that she doesn't?
That's a good thing.
You know, I don't know what's going on here.
Find Staples Center!
Finding Starples Medical Supply.
No, you dumb pocket robot!
Dan plummer rubber stumpers.
Aah!
Now you're just making up words!

Damn you!
Maiden worcestershire sauce.

That is the last straw!
I'm out of here.
Cece So, Bertie, have you always been a bus driver?
I used to manage a shoe store.

- Is that A.M.?
- I drive a bus.
Will you eat your damn sandwich, Nick.
I don't like it.
What about you, Winston?
Do you like it?
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bertie.
Sometimes it was a little hard to chew.
Well You can suck on it to make it soft.
Wow.
Is something happening between you two?
- Dude, she is so real.
- Okay, good.
Would you do me a favor?
Now, you owe me.
Winston, I would love to.
Anything.
I mean it.
Anything.
- Okay.
- I owe you.
I need you to take Ferguson home tonight for me while I just stay here and, you know, see where this goes.
Yes.
This is a big moment.
- Yeah.
- I'm proud of you.
Listen, Ferguson, I'm about to do what adults do.
- Hey, wish me luck.
- I think that's enough.
- Wish me luck.
- Oh, this is a fat cat.
It's a tough decision.
Do I?
I'll just leave - Stay here, stay here.
- Okay.
Yeah!
Cece, wait!
Please wait!
I was texting my mom!
- Dork.
- Shut up!
Oh, come on!
Do you really expect me to believe that?
No.
I-I promise I My mom She was texting me because I was super nervous about this date.
- Your mom?
- Look.
"Go get 'em, BooBoo"?
That's me.
I'm BooBoo.
Why do you need inspirational quotes from your mom just to talk to me?
I'm sorry.
I I'm just I'm coming out of this relationship, and, like I just I don't know.
I feel I don't know how to I don't know how to do this anymore.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Yeah.
Wow.
Uh I just want to put on some Drake and get up on you, girl.
You see, you're doing it again.
Damn it!
I know.
Sorry.
Hey!
Schmidt!
Schmidt, what are you doing?

Why do you have all that chocolate?
I'm going to go win her back!
Do you know where I can get a pretty candle?
!
No.
Come on, Schmidt, get in the car.
Get in the car.
I love her, Jess.
I have to tell her.
Well, you can't.
You have to let her go.
I know.
Look, you're right.
I know.
Okay, good.
Come on, get back in the car.
I also know that in about 30 seconds, I'm gonna run away from you again, and this time, I will lose you.
I'll go down alleys, I'll cut across parks.
I will live in the shadows, just slithering, lurking, trolling the darkness.
Jess, there's only one way for you to stop me.
Well, I'll do it, whatever it is.
Hit me with your car.
What?
!
No!
No!
It's the only way for you to stop me!
No!
That's crazy, Schmidt!
Come on, Jess.
Now, do it!
I deserve it.
I cheated on your best friend, I tried to break up you and Nick.
- Hit the gas.
- No!
No!
Jess, you do this, or I'm gonna run.
- I don't want to!
- I'm gonna give you to the count of three.
- No, I don't want to!
Schmidt!
- Three.
Two.
Do it for Cece.
Oh, my God!
What the hell was that?
!
You told me to hit you with the car!
- You friggin' hit me with your vehicle!
- You asked me to.
- I didn't think you were gonna do it.
- I barely tapped you.
This is my favorite utility khaki!
Well, then don't tell me to hit you with my car if you don't want me to hit you with my car!
- You're out of control!
- What?
Ma'am, please pull over.
Jess!
Oh, my God!
Schmidt!
Son of a bitch!
- I know how this looks.
- Like you hit a man with your car?
Twice.
I only meant to hit you once.
- Well, you hit me twice.
- Also, he asked me to hit him.
I'm in a really weird place.
- I just need to write a report.
- She's not a criminal.
She She was being a friend.
I hit him because I care about him.
You guys are into some weird stuff.
Well, congratulations.
You made it.
I did, didn't I?
Yeah.
And, hey, you know, don't worry about the hospital bill.
I'll pay it.
Wait a minute.
Did you think that I was gonna pay?
Well, you hit me with your car, and I thought You told me to hit you with the car.
Schmidt, don't pretend you're fine.
I know you're not.
I'm not fine.
But I will be.
Uh Let's just wait it out.
Okay.
God, it's been a half an hour.
Come up for air, you weirdoes.
Mm, mm, mm.
I'm getting kind of revved up.
Nick has some work to do.
Oh, God.
Give me a chocolate.
Mm.
- Hey, there.
- Hey.
Can I get some of that?
Mm-hmm.
You spending the night, or what?
Oh, hell, yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Nick!
We need to talk.
Winston stays.
End of discussion.
No, dude.
I got your Thanksgiving invitation.
- Did you make this?
- Absolutely not.
He's announcing Thanksgiving!
With his little trumpet, he's announcing the feast!
It's so funny We should name that little guy Roger.
When your testicles fell off, did you form lady parts, or is it kind of like a Gonzo nose down there?
It's really interesting.
Yeah.
You see, the thing is, my testicles haven't fallen off Right.
it's just the morning.
And my testicles do this really unique thing of burrowing when it's cold out.
You're burning me.
- I gotta be real with you.
- Please.
I know how a guy can get, like, lost in a relationship.
I've been there, dude.
You're snuggling, you're snuggling, you're snuggling, and then, bam!
Next thing you know, you're wearing a jean skirt and a tube top with no panties on, because you guys said you were gonna dress up like each other for Halloween.
But she doesn't dress up like you.
But you still go to the party.
I could not be more sorry for you, but that's not my story.
Stand up.
Stand up?
Yeah.
Okay.
Are those Jessica's pajama bottoms?
It's, uh football player pants for, uh, br-breast cancer awareness.
I like the way that they hug my gronk.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Camping on Thanksgiving?
It might be a crazy Nick idea, but I kind of like it.
I thought you hated camping and nature.
You said you were afraid a fly was gonna fly in your head and learn all your thoughts.
I am a man, and men belong in wilderness.
It really means a lot to me.
The only thing I care about is that we're all together.
And that we can all sit down together and have a nice dinner.
I 100% agree.
I think everybody's gonna love this idea.
Me, too.
- Camping?
- Like we're animals?
- What the hell?
Come on.
Hear him out.
Let's face it.
Our indoor Thanksgivings haven't been so great.
Turkey!
Dead body!
I think I'm into your mother.
So this can't be worse.
Thank you, Jessica, I got it from here.
All right.
This Thanksgiving, I want to honor the traditions of our forefathers.
The mighty Pilgrims and Native Americans who came together in order to survive.
Sure, yeah.
The first chapter in a proud history of cooperation.
It'll be the ultimate test of manhood and our survival skills.
- It will?
- How's this for a test of our manhood?
We stay at home, we drink beer, we watch football.
Manhood.
I like that idea.
Winston, I'm talking about real men.
Me, too.
Men who fend for themselves.
You're the laziest man I know.
Okay, Jess, be honest with me.
Has he ever been on top?
Real men are on the bottom.
No, they're not.
- You're on the bottom - Guys, guys.
It's Thanksgiving.
We need to be together.
Who's in?
Come on, guys!
- All right, I'm in.
- What?
- Yeah, Schmidt!
- Yes!
Look, my parents were super divorced and they never took me camping, but I always thought that I'd be incredible at it.
Let's get ready.
What the hell is on your head, Schmidt?
It's an exact replica of the hat.
Viggo Mortensen wore in Hidalgo.
Knew you'd like it.
Wow!
Nice job, Miller!
This spot's beautiful.
I know.
- Cece!
- Cece's here?
I didn't know she was gonna be here.
Yay, I'm so happy you came!
We're all together!
- It makes me so excited.
- Of course!
I mean, what could be better than camping in the woods with my ex-boyfriend and his friend I just made out with.
With whom you just made out.
- Don't.
- It's very important.
You know I hate that.
- Don't.
- Grammar's important.
Seriously, don't.
If it get awkward, I'll come save you.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Yay!
Hey, what's up, girl?
Hey, Cece.
Hey, I never, uh had a chance to ask you.
How did the, um How'd your guys' date go the other night?
- Oh, with Cece?
- Yeah.
Uh it was I loved it.
I mean, it was good.
It was cool.
That's great.
Super.
- Super-duper.
- So where you thinking - about pitching, uh, pitching a tent?
- Thinking over there.
- Oh, yonder?
- Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
- Yonder.
- Listen, I've been researching on the Internet for the past 12 hours everything there is to know about the wood.
Now I'm a I'm a master camper.
So if you need any help with anything, just come to me and ask, okay?
Thanks, man.
I don't know anything about the wood.
I know everything.
I'm lost.
What is that, a tree?
If these trees were skyscrapers, - you'd feel very comfortable.
- Yeah.
I'd be right at home.
Unfortunately, - they're actual trees.
- Yeah.
You're the best.
I love the hat!
I'm sorry, is that a solar cell phone charger?
Yeah, I can't go more than two days without it.
Okay, hold on.
Do you do you hate camping, too?
Are you kidding me?
I absolutely hate camping.
Then why are we here?
Because I didn't get a say.
I never get a say.
Whenever I want to do something, they don't give a hoot.
Guess who just got free passes to a pottery seminar.
- Get out of here.
- Winston!
We could've made the craziest mugs, man.
- Hey, Nick?
- Yeah.
There's just beer in here.
That should last us for the first few hours, - actually.
- Where's the food?
Where-where are all the pies I made?
Look, don't worry, Jess.
'Cause the food is right here.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand that gesture.
We're gonna be hunting and foraging for our dinner, just like the Indians and the Pilgrims.
But you brought beer.
You can't forage for beer.
And that's a necessity.
So this is Thanksgiving meal?
We can do this.
Guys, we've gotten soft!
With our antibiotics and our sports creams.
Do you think George Washington had a pet cat?
Yeah.
No.
He didn't.
He hunted them.
What?
And he made milk and butter out of their spoils.
That's terrible.
So you're saying George Washington milked his cat?
Nothing is sounding accurate right now.
Not at all.
Where'd you read this?
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be hard.
But we will emerge out of this better friends and a tribe.
I'm on board.
Going old-school.
Men!
Killing!
Hunting!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Oh, my cowman's my cowman my cowman's hat, my cowman's hat.
Guys, look, I'm as much a man as anybody here, but this plan is straight-up dookie.
I need my sweets and I need my parade.
Yeah, you know what?
I'm out, too.
Guys, guys, guys.
Look.
We're together.
We're a family.
It's Thanksgiving.
And I'm sure Nick has a plan.
Right?
- Oh, yeah.
I've got a plan.
- Great.
- You got a plan?
- The man's got a plan.
These wilderness guides right here detail what plants are safe for eating and what traps we can build.
Unfortunately, I ran out of money, so I couldn't print out the chapters on gutting and skinning, but we'll worry about that when we get there.
Pilgrim rules.
Men, hunters!
Women, foragers.
I'm not hunting.
The only Hunt I want is Bonnie or Helen.
You know what I'm talking about, Coach.
What?
Nick.
This is perfect.
Primal man in nature.
Stalking prey.
Who's basically the lady now, Coach?
I've seen that tree six times in the past 20 minutes.
We're definitely moving in a small circle.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna clear a path this way.
We will travel northbound, I believe.
That's not north; that's south.
That is south?
Then let's travel southbound.
I'm gonna clear a path.
If something's in there and you get injured, I promise you I will kill you fast.
Scat!
Scat.
There's an animal nearby.
Hey, Schmidt, that's a raisin, man.
That's not a raisin.
This is scat.
Okay.
That's poop for sure.
I was right.
In your face, Nick.
- In your face, Nick.
- How so?
I don't know, he put a put a turd in his mouth.
- And that's in my face?
- Yeah.
I don't think we should start eating poo yet, Schmidt.
Let's wait on that.
You want to chase that with some dirt?
Does anyone have any gum?
No.
Not that I wanted any in the first place.
That's a mighty big hole there, Nick.
You trying to catch a refrigerator?
It's a bear hole.
Bear falls in, other stuff falls in.
We take what the bear doesn't want.
Makes sense.
Classic human/bear team-up.
I'm from Chicago.
It's the best I can do.
Yeah, bears love to share.
What are you planning on doing with that bear when he falls into the hole?
Dude, I'm trying the best that I can!
We have no food.
Let me explain something to you, Nick.
When you're building a trap, you want to customize it to your prey.
So, I don't know, if was trying to catch, say a squirrel, I'd want think like a squirrel.
Allow me to demonstrate with this trap that I built.
How do you get into the mindset of a squirrel?
I'm a squirrel right?
You do that really well.
Look at this!
Oh, there's some nuts here.
Look at all these little nuts.
You might not want to do that.
If I needed your advice on how to lead a spinning class, I'd ask you, but this is my territory.
- My scapula!
- Dude, are you all right?
Aah!
Aah, get it off!
Aah!
Get it!
Get up.
Keep breathing, man.
I don't mean to be laughing, but are you okay?
I'm gonna make you a sling.
You're gonna make me a what?
You don't know how to do that.
A sling.
- Of course I do.
- What?
- What are you doing?
- I was an Eagle Scout.
What are you talking about, you were an Eagle Scout?
- Look.
- That's actually really good.
I'm sorry, dude.
You wanted to be the best at camping.
You were so excited about your hat.
I didn't want to get in the way of that.
Plus with the whole Cece thing or whatever.
What are talking about?
You're gonna let me be the best camper.
I am the best camper!
Yeah.
I think this is chicory.
It says you can eat the root.
Or it's jasmine.
Which will kill you.
Hmm.
What do you guys think?
- I'm sure it's fine.
- Yeah, just eat it.
Hey, raspberries!
There Ow!
Ow.
There are a lot of brambles in here.
There's a country store not far from here.
Ow!
Three and a half stars.
The reviews say, "It's functional and dusty".
- Ow!
- Sounds good to me.
This is so fun.
Who wants to help?
This plan is officially the worst.
We are starving.
Just admit, you don't want to do this, either.
Okay, listen up.
Only stuff we can find in the forest, right?
Look at that fish.
It's perfect.
What?
Oh, I'm gonna grab it.
I'm so hungry.
Now we get to eat, boys.
Dude, that looks dead.
Guys, stop being negative right now.
Laying on its side means it's dead.
I wouldn't get in that water, man.
You're gonna get beaver fever.
Where are my testicles now, Coach?
When he catches that little critter, I'm gonna show you how to scale it.
Ow.
That hurts?
Yeah, it hurts!
A boulder fell on my Is all this 'cause I teased you about the invite?
Yes, it is!
No regrets!
Aw!
Aw, come on, Nick.
Yes!
Quit it.
You guys might be right!
It might be dead!
In fact, it was dead!
Smells fresh enough!
Oh, come on, Winston, what?
You just get your nails done?
Get the apple dirty!
Grind some dirt in it, grind some dirt in it.
God, I'm so hungry!
Hey, hey!
Hey.
Look what the men brought.
Oh, hey!
Hey, hey!
The plan worked.
Hey, he looks like a fighter.
He really was, kind of.
- Oh, my God!
- Wow.
I mean, well Whoa.
Like a smorgasbord.
You guys did great.
- Yeah, we did.
- Yep.
Where'd you get the cashews?
- Um, on a bush.
- Yeah.
How about the beets?
- Also a bush.
- That's right.
Yeah.
The avocado?
- Also on a bush.
- That's right.
Well, look at us.
Living off the land, fending for ourselves.
We got fish and fruits, and this is probably gonna be the most delicious apple I've ever eaten in my life.
"Product of Oregon"?
We walked to Oregon?
- What?
- What?
That's why this cramp Yeah This place Come on, you think the three of us are true dumb-asses?
We're not.
I kind of knew from the beginning.
I mean, there's no way.
You just went to a store and got all this?
I think so.
I think they definitely bought everything from the store.
The one thing I wanted was for us all to sit down together and have dinner, and you can't do that without dinner.
We have dinner.
That fish kind of looks like hippo meat.
Come on, man.
Let's just sit down and eat some delicious almonds.
- And enjoy ourselves.
- Yes.
And have a really nice Thanksgiving together.
- Come on, Nick, let's eat.
- Come on, man, let's eat.
I feel like how they must've felt on the first Thanksgiving.
Betrayed.
What?
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Oh, come on.
Nick, come on!
- Don't do this.
FYI, the first Thanksgiving was the good one.
Come on, Nick!
These avocados were expensive!
Here we go.
It smells so good.
I can't wait till it's ready.
I'm gonna be so stuffed.
Ooh!
The eyeball fell off.
That's how you know it's good.
They got to pop out when it's ready, I think.
Now that the cards are finally on the table, I guess we can see who the true camp master really is.
The answer's me.
First one to make a flame wins.
Let's do this.
Now, check this out.
This is how you make a flame.
You go with two rocks.
One against the other.
You create friction.
- I'm done.
- What?
I'm done.
Well, that's barely a flame, it's going out.
Whoa!
Well, goodness gracious!
What are you?
A sorcerer?
Damn it!
Hey, mountain man.
You want to come eat some dirty vegetables with us?
I should've known those beets weren't from nature.
Nothing purple grows in nature.
Look, we didn't come through, okay?
You came through!
Look, you caught a fish!
That's really, really impressive.
How'd you do it?
With my bare hands.
- No way!
You're so strong.
- Yeah.
Yeah, it was It fought What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
I think that's amazing.
You provided for us.
- You're a man.
- Don't patronize me, Jess.
I'm not.
Ever since we started dating, Jess, we've been doing a bunch of girly stuff, and I like some of it and you, but my tolerance to alcohol has, like, gotten really, scary low.
I drank three beers, and I got, like, all giggly and tired.
And I didn't want a fourth.
Last night, I had a dream that I was brushing a horse.
I just feel like I'm losing myself a little.
Just let me eat this disgusting fish and - No, Nick, Nick.
- Yeah, just let me be over here.
This is the most beautiful fish I've ever seen.
Don't touch I wouldn't touch it.
It is!
It is.
Jess, don't Don't put your hands in Oh, my Lo Spit it out.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Fragrant.
Mmm, I can really I can really taste the lake.
Spit it out.
I feel like I'm there in the lake with the fish.
Mmm!
Bony.
That's gonna hurt going down.
But I like it.
Hurts so good!
Hurts so good!
Jess, that fish was dead when I caught it.
There was a sock near it.
I'm gonna come with you.
No.
Jess, let me come with you.
Where are you going?
There's something over here.
I'm gonna look at it.
Jess I'm seeing some interesting things.
I'm out of the office till Friday.
For immediate assistance, please call Deb at extension A.C. Slater.
You guys see where she went?
- No.
- No.
Jess?
- Jess?
- Jess?
Jess!
- Jess?
- Jess?
Jess?
Jess!
I just want to see more carpet samples before I make a final decision.
Jess!
Jess?
Jess!
Jess, where are you?
Jess!
Jessica!
Oh, God, this is all my fault.
And you know what, Coach?
I did like the invitation.
I made it.
And I liked the little trumpet guy.
I thought he was cute.
- He was cute as a damn button!
- What?
So many st Hey, guys, look.
There she is!
There are dogs that have dollar signs but don't even own banks.
- Jess, we're over here!
- Jess!
Wait, wait, wait.
I've seen that tree before.
Jess, stop!
The bear trap!
- No!
- I'm coming!
Jess!
Headfirst?
Why?
Son of a Oh, my God, Jess, I am so sorry.
I was an idiot.
This Thanksgiving plan was so stupid.
You shouldn't have eaten that fish.
I'm sorry.
Don't let them pay the bill, okay?
You bring the check to me.
No arguments, moon man.
Oh, my God!
Is anyone hurt?
We're fine.
I may have cracked a few ribs, and, uh, Jess is delirious.
I think she thinks she's a rabbit.
Guys, we're gonna figure something out, all right?
Just get us a rope or a stick or something.
All right, man, so, any ideas?
What are you talk?
You know what, Coach?
Don't humor me.
- What?
- You know what to do.
Look, I admit it.
You're a better camper than I am.
You're better at life than I am.
You're probably better at dating Cece than I am.
I saw you guys the other night inhaling each other in front of the loft.
Schmidt, that's all we did.
That was it.
I asked her to come upstairs, she said no, okay?
And now she won't return any of my text messages.
She's been ignoring me this whole trip.
I'm all, like, "Hey".
She's like, "Mm-hmm".
I'm like, "What"?
Why are you smiling, dude?
I'm not smiling.
I'm over here baring my soul to you, dude, and you're freaking smiling in my face.
Yeah.
This is the face I make when I listen.
All your teeth show when you listen?
I'm not.
You're smiling right now.
I opened up to you.
You're pissing me off.
Stop smiling.
I'm not.
I will wreck you.
You're crazy, man.
You're nuts.
Stop it, listen to me.
We are going to solve this right now.
All right, take your pants off.
Okay, I am no Eagle Scout, but I know how to make a pants rope.
- Pants rope.
- You're a genius.
I know.
Okay.
Are you gonna take off your pants?
Yeah, right after I take off my bra so we can anchor the rope to the tree.
- That's gonna happen for real?
- Just take them off now.
Whoa, look at Winston's pants.
It's got kittens on it.
These aren't kittens.
I cannot believe I'm here voluntarily.
So stupid.
Take them off.
They're coming off.
Here, you guys, grab hold of the rope.
Okay, you go first, Jess.
I'll be right behind you to support you.
- Ding, dong, ding, dong!
- What are you doing?
Okay, how about this?
Get on my back, I'll bring us both up.
Back at you.
Whoa.
You can do it!
There, hold this flashlight, buddy.
Grab hold.
- Come on, Nick!
Come on.
- Here we go!
Oh, God, I'm gonna get you out of here.
Use your legs, Nick.
Come on, Nick!
Come on.
- Ah, Winston, I hate your leggings.
- Come on.
Almost there.
- Let's go.
- You got it, you got it.
You got it, you You chubby son of a bitch.
Yeah.
You okay, Jess, you all right?
Yeah!
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Oh!
Hey.
Thanks for saving me, mountain man.
So I've got good news from the doctor: you don't have rabies.
Oh.
You have, uh, giardia and something called Legionnaires' disease.
I'm just glad they were able to save your foot.
What?
No, nothing.
Never mind.
Hey, I'm sorry about the whole camping thing.
Oh, no, it's okay.
Ah, I was really stupid.
I haven't been myself.
You're the man I want.
All you wanted was for everyone to be together on Thanksgiving, Jess.
Next year.
Potato chips.
Chips?
Maybe a treat.
Listen, Coach, uh, in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I thought maybe that I could give you some advice about about Cece.
How desperate do you think I am?
I think you're probably very desperate.
I'm very desperate, I mean, she's giving me nothing.
Told her she looked pretty, she said thanks.
Mm-hmm.
What kind of mind game is that?
Look, Coach, things have always come easy to you.
Cece is not going to be one of those things.
I once spent hours in a car with just a cracked window for air.
She was going into a club and she just kind of left me there.
Why are you smiling about that?
Hey, guys, I figured out a way to save Thanksgiving.
- I got a plan.
- Enough with the plans.
- You suck at plans!
- Not another Nick Miller plan.
I love you, man, but you are terrible at plans.
Hey.
It's still 11:48, so happy Thanksgiving.
What?
Got us some Brazilian nuts, a couple of string cheeses, and.
Snack.
Thank you.
I got the parade on my phone.
Yes.
Made some decorations.
I think this may be a turkey sandwich, but I'm not sure, and I know this whole thing isn't It's perfect.
Look, guys, start without me because it might be a few weeks before I can eat again.
You were throwing up a lot.
That was scary seriously.
Okay, I'm starving actually.
Let's eat.
Yeah, let's eat.
Nick found all this food in the woods.
Can I have the ginger ale?
Yeah, Nick found that.
It's already open.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Well, nothing brightens up a rainy day like a Scotch tasting, guys.
It's not raining today.
It hasn't rained in months.
Shh, don't ruin the moment.
There's actually a huge forest fire.
Dude, you should turn on the news.
This is a 15-year-old French oak reserve.
Mm!
A note of cedar, vanilla, tobacky.
Boozy.
Hunting, fishing, shooting, fatherhood, bonding, sadness.
Please don't leave me.
- Cheers, guys.
Put 'er there Schmidty.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
- To a nice quiet evening.
- Tranquil.
This moment is so chill and absent of drama, I want to call it "Tim Duncan".
I have 21 minutes to make a life-changing decision and you beautiful sons-a-bitches are gonna help me!
- Whoa.
- Yeah!
That is $45 worth of Scotch right there.
It tastes disgusting.
I don't like it.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
So, obviously, Nick has told you about how I've been volunteering at the Children's Museum, and really hitting it off with the head curator, Candace, right?
In my way, I have.
- I've never heard that.
- Hasn't said a word.
Thank God.
Come on.
Guys, give me one second.
I gotta go play a round of "Car Keys Monte" with Kevin-97 or he'll try to drive home.
So, anyway, about a month ago, Candace calls me and tells me there might be a full-time fund-raising position opening up - and I'd be perfect for it.
- There we go, look for the keys, look for the keys, look for the keys.
And she keeps pushing me for an answer, and I keep putting her off.
I say, "Thank you very much.
I'm very flattered, but I already have a job.
Me teacher".
That's a grammar joke.
You get it.
Look at the jukebox for a sec.
When I think of teachers, I think of two things: Jessica Day and pornography where the characters are teachers.
Well, of course I've always wanted to be a teacher, but my school's a disaster.
Justice Brandeis believed that Ms. Day?
Education's Principal Foster, everybody!
Thank you so much.
Ms. Day, we have hit a construction hiccup - in our renovation, so - Okay.
everybody's gonna have to be sharing classroom space.
What?
- Oh.
- Hey, do you have a freezer or should I flush these frogs?
My check comes either way.
Oh, come on.
Foster's sticking us with the math kids that use letters instead of numbers?
Do you mean algebra?
I guess.
Anyway, it's gonna be a couple of crazy months, huh?
I'm sorry?
Months?
Right.
Years if the bond issue fails.
Which it might, since voters are trending anti-future.
Anti-future?
Who's anti-future?
I don't know.
The Amish?
The dying?
Television industry, print media, record industry, railroad industry, karaoke machine owners.
You got this?
I'm gonna go not smoke pot.
- So my phone rings - Oh, we telling phone stories?
Nice.
- No, I'm talking about work.
- So your phone rings.
And it's Candace officially offering me the job!
And I told her I'd think about it!
Wow, you not being a school teacher?
Well, you have found my flabbergast button, and guess what, you've pressed it.
I'm flabbergasted as hell, too.
Look, I've been a teacher my entire life, and I've always wanted to be a teacher, but maybe I should be doing something else.
I don't know.
How do you know when you're on the right path?
It's crazy.
That wasn't a rhetorical question.
- Oh!
- Oh!
What I like to do is just take a drive up PCH maybe.
Willy Wonka once said Guys, Candace is calling at 6:00 to find out my final answer!
- Whoa!
- What?
I'm sorry you're in such a pickle.
But I'm not sorry that I get to time something!
- All right.
- Just to be clear, 19 minutes until 6:00.
I'm not sure this is helping.
This brings a whole new level of tension to the whole situation.
Yeah, because you're being timed now.
- You time a lot of stuff, Coach.
- 46 seconds.
This is a life-changing decision, that's it.
Coach, do you always wear a stopwatch?
Like always?
You familiar with Rollergirl's relationship to her skates in Boogie Nights?
- Yes.
- Well, I'm not, because I don't watch movies, I time them.
They're pornographers, but they're also a family.
my round ass!
Jess, choosing a career path is never easy, but what I found - Oh, my God.
- Shut up, dude!
She's looking for career advice.
Your job could be done by a vending machine.
Guys, don't be mean.
So Nick doesn't have a traditional career.
I mean Or is it the most traditional?
Maybe I'm thinking about prostitution.
Guys, as you all know, I am the expert at changing career paths.
Is this something we're now bragging about?
No, Schmidt, I'm referring to my decision to quit playing the game of basketball.
Jess, I will tell you this, it was not easy.
It all began back Come on, Winston move it along.
Okay, Jess, fine, but don't blame me if you get lost in the nooks and crannies of this crazy English muffin we call Winston's life.
I was the ninth guy off the bench for the eighth-best team in Latvia.
Winnie the Bish!
Winnie the Bish!
Winnie the Bish!
Ha-ha!
Thanks for coming to watch me play, guys.
We didn't watch you play.
We watched you sit.
Which was still fun.
You know, any chance to get to Latvia, right, guys?
Yeah, I haven't played all year.
They barely let me practice, but you know, like I always say, How about them Lats?
So that's when you decided to change course.
That makes sense.
So my takeaway from that is Still building to the decision.
You are traded to Kraslava City.
The Outdoor League?
Man, they play on a hillside!
I give you surprise tip: Uphill basket, better.
Aha, and then you decided Ah!
I'm going fast!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
You never play basketball again.
Don't touch it.
Stop it.
And that's when I decided to stop playing the game of basketball.
Jess, walk away the moment you stop loving it.
I mean, that's what I did.
That's the thing, you didn't walk away.
You decided nothing.
That story contains zero decisions.
Look, I decided to stop playing the game of basketball when my doctor told me I had to stop.
Okay, okay, all right, I it was my decision Mm-hmm.
to start to play the game of basket You were handed a basketball six seconds after you were born.
Damn, do I even like basketball?
I mean, goodness, have I ever made any decisions my whole life?
Are we all just living inside the mind of a giant?
All right, good job, buddy.
Really good.
Thanks.
You know, if I may be so bold Oh, Nick, please.
Winston, have a seat.
I was literally about to give advice.
She already heard one cautionary tale tonight, she does not need to hear another.
- What she needs to hear is my story.
- All right.
A story of hard choices.
A story of paths taken.
A story that I like to call, "Kablamo McYeah, Bro"!
Ah, you stupid bast The title has nothing to do with the story, but you need a hook.
- It all began back - Come on, Schmidt!
What?
Only one story in the whole wide world can begin in a hospital?
I volunteered a lot in college.
But I shone brightest as a candy striper.
Sick people wanted me.
Dying people wanted to be me.
I was the total candy-striping package.
And yet I remained invisible to the one whose gaze I desired the most.
Invisible?
You were like a 300-pound wall of peppermint bark.
Her badge said "RN" for registered nurse, but as far as I was concerned, it said "NILTH," "Nurse I'd Like To Hug".
Not even the baggiest of scrubs could hide her splendid form.
Where's a guy have to volunteer to get a girl like that, huh?
I don't volunteer.
I'm a man.
I have a job in marketing.
Obviously I was far too fat to work in marketing.
So I got a job any dumb slob could do.
Relax, man, it's your first day.
For a Jewish giant, I had a surprising knack for selling Christmas trees.
Not only did my wide center of gravity make me freakishly strong, but I could also sell like the wind.
Because I understood one fundamental truth.
When you're buying Christmas trees you're really buying sex.
Have you always been short?
I've always been fat.
But who cares how God made you?
Don't let him put you in a skin box.
At the end of the day, I'm just a fat guy standing here in front of a short guy telling him that I think we found his tree.
It wasn't long before I caught the attention of Old Man McCue, Christmas tree king of Syracuse, inventor of triple netting.
However In the words of the late, great Sir Billy Joel Billy Joel is definitely alive.
And he's definitely not a knight.
"The good, they do die young".
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left 'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long That even my mama thinks That my mind is gone, but When you're on your deathbed, when your life has been lived, you're never gonna say, "I wish I'd spent more time with my family".
Because money and everything it buys, you can take it with you Interesting, money.
Actually the museum job pays more than the teaching job.
Wait, the m Then what the hell are we talking about here, you guys?
Done deal, case closed.
Follow them ducats.
It's not always about the money, Schmidt.
Guys, look, it's almost 6:00.
And Candace is insanely punctual.
You know, one of the best career choices of the future Driveways.
You're welcome.
- Jess, the museum job pays more.
- All right - The decision has been made for you.
- No, no, no.
You don't know the difference between more and less.
- Don't you?
- Yes, Schmidt.
All of my decision's have been made for me.
I'm only in sports radio because I played professional basketball.
I played professional basketball because somebody put a ball in my crib as a baby.
What if somebody gave Baby Winston a flower?
Then what would I be?
- Beekeeper!
- Hummingbird farmer.
Oh, does water shoot out of the flower?
If so, you'd be a hilarious comedian.
Wait, guys, this is classic after 6:00 topics.
Look, I There has to be more to this than money.
I really want to care about what I do.
Don't you ever miss getting your hands dirty - and selling?
- I've moved up in the world.
I'm not freezing and covered in sap.
I'm making spreadsheets.
It's like Old Man McCue used to say.
The reward is in the destination.
It's not in the journey.
Was he wise or was he senile?
Because he's mixed up a lot of really well-known sayings.
Jess, you're gonna want to listen to me.
Anyone else here named after their career?
People call you Markety?
Not yet.
That's too bad 'cause that's awesome.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Hands up, Ulvis!
Ball screen, Vlad, come on!
There we go, yes!
Bishop, finger out of your nose, now!
Ernie's a really good coach.
- Maybe we should call him Coach.
- We should probably call him You do it first.
- Yeah.
- Uh Coach.
That's a great name!
High five!
Yeah!
I think you see what I mean.
No, I do I really don't.
My point is don't overthink it, Jess.
The call's coming from inside the house.
What?
Be who you are.
And do what you do.
What if I don't know who I am?
And you know, I'm capable of doing a lot of different things.
Then you are on your own.
Good stuff, Coach.
Jess, would it help to think about your first day as a teacher?
Like, I think about the first time I ever poured a drink - Boo, get off the stage!
- Aw, man.
- Nick!
- Dude, stop.
No, that's interesting.
The first day I ever taught.
Portland Country Day.
Five-team Pacific Northwest squash champions.
Go, Rhododendrons!
Now, if I was chalk, where would I be?
If I were chalk, where would I be?
Slip up like that in front of the kids, Day, and they'll eat you alive.
Eddie Pascucci kicked my ass because I'm new.
Well, guess what?
I'm new, too.
I got lost trying to find the upper dining garden.
Oh, that's over by the hedge maze and the stables.
I haven't even met my horse yet.
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.
All of these jackets have cash in the pockets.
It's like a $50,000 lost and found.
Here, try this one.
Yup.
You look great, Clifton.
This doesn't fit!
Eddie Pascucci beats up the unstylish!
Yeah, that's right.
We had an ethnic, gay bully.
He's gonna have to come through me first.
Clifton Collins really just needed someone to believe in him.
So I started tutoring him in math, and he became the best math student in school.
So, let's look him up and see how happy and successful and amazing he's doing.
- Yeah!
- I think that'll really fire you up.
All right, there's no trace of him.
- What?
- I'm really, I'm really good at this.
I'm good at it, let me see.
- You found him.
He's right here.
- No, I didn't.
- Here's Clifton, wow.
- It's not a - Yeah, he's right there.
That's Clifton.
- Oh, yeah.
We're not the only ones looking for him.
- So's the FBI.
- What?
- Yeah, he's a criminal.
- No.
Oh, my God.
Clifton "Baby Madoff" Collins?
Wanted for 53 counts of embezzlement.
Sounds like the math took.
Screw me.
Like, I Maybe I wasn't even reaching the kids at all.
Okay, you know what?
- Miller up.
- Excuse me?
That's just like "fill 'er up," but with "Miller".
- Don't.
- 'Cause I'm about to fill you up.
- No, that's gross.
- With my stories.
- Oh, please don't.
- That's disgusting.
What's disgusting about it?
My first year of law school, I made an important discovery.
Look left.
Look right.
Next year, one of you will be gone.
What a clichÃ©, huh?
Oh, you wrote that down.
You'll be gone.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be right here.
Take it easy, guy to my right.
I discovered that I hated being around these people.
But second year, I made another discovery.
I hated being around myself.
So my third year, I wanted to find a place where I belonged.
Where I could look to my left or look to my right and like what I saw.
Love you in that scarf.
Why don't you wear scarves anymore?
That place?
Perhaps you guessed it: This very bar.
Get out of town.
What a twist.
How long has that guy been there?
Kevin-97?
Since 1997, Jess.
Why else do you think we would call him I don't know.
Move it along, Miller.
True, I wasn't loving law school, but my grades were fine and I even signed up for the California State Bar.
And then, one day Red over-served himself and everything changed.
So you went behind the bar, quit law school, you became a bartender - There's more to it than that.
- Two minutes!
Oh, my God.
I honestly don't know what to do.
I have so little time.
Hey.
Cece!
Have you ever questioned your entire career?
Duh, I'm a 31 year old model.
My last job was for a phone sex ad, and I was the one calling.
Tell me what to do.
And don't tell me to ask the guys, because I already tried that.
And also, don't tell me to think about my first student, Clifton.
Okay, no, wait.
Your first student was not Clifton.
Lady, she's still got one minute.
That was a butt dial from your mother.
She is up to no good.
Cece, bring it fast, and bring it hard.
You have 53 seconds.
You okay?
Yes.
No.
I think I need glasses unless crying makes your eyes not work.
I can't read this, but even when I can, I don't understand it.
Crying makes your eyes work better.
After I finished Sophie's Choice, I could see in the dark for a week.
Here's what I do when I lose mine.
Ooh, this is interesting.
Get in here, we'll learn it together.
But everyone'll laugh at us.
They can drive it or milk it as far as I'm concerned.
I don't know what that means.
I heard my dad say it.
My dad just died.
Well, if you want to come over, and listen to mine say "They can drive it or milk it" you can.
He's also got one about the turds in City Hall.
Thanks.
- I'm Cece.
- Jess.
I was your first student.
Hey, Candace.
Um Yeah, actually I'm not gonna take the job.
Yeah, I'll see you Sunday.
Okay, bye.
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Thanks guys.
- Yes!
- Thanks guys.
- You did it.
Good stuff.
Hey, she did it.
You made the right call, Jess.
What's wrong?
I think you're right.
I made the right decision.
Look, I know it's hard, but the hard is what makes it good.
- Uhm, A League of Their Own - Is that from A League of Their Own.
Yes, of course.
All of my quotes are from a sports movie.
You guys don't know them, and so they seem original.
A League of Their Own is not a sports movie.
It's a sports movie, first and foremost.
It's about sisterhood and the war.
- Yeah, absolutely.
- It's about a baseball team grinding it up.
This used to be my playground Coming right up.
His sister really worries about his drinking, so what I do is I come in early, and I soak a teabag until the water turns brown and looks like booze.
I call it tea-water.
So tea.
I will take a big old glass of booze-water.
Got an antacid commercial tomorrow - Oof.
- and I'm playing day-old curry.
Or you can bartend.
You can bartend till you're 90 years old.
Why don't you fire this down to Kevin-97?
Oh, no.
We're gonna work on that.
Good morning, everybody.
Welcome to Alge-Bio-Civics.
Turn in your equations, and you will get a frog.
Dissect carefully, because inside the frog is the name of the city council member who you will be e-mailing to restart construction.
- Ms. Day?
- Yes.
I thought this was gonna be a disaster.
But thanks to you, I can go upstairs to the big boys and tell them they can always depend on Dr. Alan Foster.
Yeah.
Please take his job, I'm begging you.
I'd do it myself, but I'd never pass the psych test.
So I figure if Foster can be a principal, then why can't I be a principal?
- That's great.
- I don't see why not.
- Thank you.
- Then you could take me to the principal's office and punish me - for being tardy, and - You know we're right here, right?
Just lift up my britches and - We'll talk about it later.
- Okay.
- Very nice.
- We'll do it in my office.
After I fill up my juice box.
So, guys, just quit my job today.
- Whoa, big decision.
- Oh, man!
- What?
I just finally said to myself, "It is time to make your own decisions".
- Right on.
- Yeah.
If it doesn't work out, I'm sure they'd be happy to have you back.
They would they would not like to have me back.
- I burned a lot of bridges today.
- Mmm.
Uh, stuff got weird.
Stuff got racial.
- What?
- I used a lot of swearwords.
Then I got sexual Well, sounds like you need a drink.
On the house.
- What can I get you?
- Ooh Let me get a, let me get a We have everything.
What would you like to drink?
But you know, I'll make the decision.
Let me get - Double amaretto, extra cherries!
- Double amaretto, extra cherries!
That's what I was gonna say.
Nice.
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my goodness!
My first shift, you know?
I'm still working on it.
- She's getting better.
- That was great.
- That was awesome.
- Yeah.
A natural.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Sorry I didn't let you finish your story.
- What's this?
- The end of my story.
No way!
You passed the bar exam?
I wanted to prove to myself that I dropped out of law school because I wanted to be a bartender, not because I couldn't be a lawyer.
- This also says "spaghetti sandwich".
- That's just 'cause it's a great idea.
When I have a great idea, I write it down.
The point is is I want this.
You know, it makes me happy.
Well, here.
Now, can I get you a drink?
- Sure.
- Sure.
Cheers.
To unemployment.
- Absolutely.
- Exactly.
I see you're looking at a Douglas fir.
It's a beautiful tree.
We move a ton of these Dougie firs.
Love them.
But I feel like you're ready for the spruce lifestyle.
Let's spruce this up.
Let me put you in a spruce today.
What kind of ceilings you dealing with at home?
Vaulted?
Cathedral?
By the way, there's no wrong answer.
You look like a confident man, you know that?
You deserve a confident tree
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh, snap, snap, - Oh, snap, snap.
- Wow - That sounds pretty good.
- Thank you.
Hey, listen.
Schmidt, I've been kinda stuck on this whole career search thing.
- Oh.
- You think I'd be good at advertising?
- I mean, that's what you do, right?
- Advertising is a dog.
Drinking beer.
A fat moron falling down the stairs.
A snot-nosed brat kicking his rapping grandpa in the testicles.
The rapping grandpa kills me, though.
I am in marketing, Winston.
The backbone of capitalism.
- Without it, you'd be dead in two days.
- I could be good at that.
Probably not, but you can shadow me at work today to find out.
Yeah!
Team drug store, back from mission.
- Drug store, right, Coach?
- Yeah.
Uh, can I have my bag?
- Yeah.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
- Thanks.
So, same time next week, right?
Team drug store?
We'll go again to the drug store?
Team drug store?
Ugh!
God!
What a walnut!
It's been two months we've been living with him, and I have yet to crack him.
It's like we just spent an hour together.
It was, like, nothing, no connection.
And don't tell me it's in my mind, because it's not.
We ran into one of his friends, and Coach said the meanest thing about me.
Check these out.
Can you believe these are for glaucoma?
She's my buddy's girlfriend.
You are my girlfriend.
What's the big deal?
I want him to think of me as his friend.
- Oh, I hear that.
- Well, it'll happen if it's meant to.
I need to find a way in.
I found a way to force myself into all of your lives.
You just didn't know it.
- Food, clothes, Onesie pajamas.
- I like the butt flap.
You really think mine was food?
I can think of five other reasons I wanted to be your friend.
Boob, boob, vagina, butt cheek, butt cheek.
In that order?
Well, I'm not gonna say, "vagina, butt cheek, boob, butt cheek, boob".
- Yeah, but that's the correct - That's the order, yeah.
Season 3, Episode 12 "Basketsball" Look, Nick, I need help.
Like, tell me about Coach.
Like, what's up with him?
What does he like?
What does he dislike?
Well, Coach 101 is, he's watching basketball.
And that's all he's gonna do from October till June.
His team's the Pistons.
I mean, they were great in the '80s, but then we got Jordan.
Then they started getting good.
Then we got Thibodeau.
What you gonna do now?
And he knows that.
That's genius.
Basketball.
That's my way in.
Basketball's not your in.
You don't know anything about basketball.
- Come on.
- You refer to it as "basketsball".
Well, that's the technically-correct term, Nick.
There are two baskets.
I'm an English teacher.
Basketball's just the first step.
We sit down, we watch a game.
We have a few laughs.
Before you know it, we'll be digging into each other's pasts.
- That's not how it works, though.
- Childhoods, Nick.
That's the friendship money shot.
Men watch sports so we don't have to talk about childhood stuff.
- No.
- It's a real thing.
And the game doesn't even have deeper meaning.
- Come on.
- And there's no layers to it.
If I'm talking about a player overcoming the defense to win, - that's not like I'm overcoming it.
- No.
Come on.
Not only that.
He's a Pistons fan, and I'm a Bulls fan.
Right.
I don't understand, no.
- It's rivalries.
- Sharks and cats.
- Yankees, Red Sox.
- Whales and dolphins.
Pistons fan, Bulls fan.
End of discussion.
I get it.
Jean Valjean and Javert.
Yeah, definitely.
This is like a Jean Vanjer and Vajer situation.
- So, where do you do the marketing?
- Oh, Winston, so sweet, so naive.
Where do we do the marketing?
We do the marketing everywhere.
Now, you're gonna want to take notes on everything I do, 'cause you're about to see life happen at the speed of business.
- Schmidt.
I have a task for you.
- Hi, Kim.
We got a new guy, and I want you to show him around.
- Wait.
Who's this?
- Oh, I'm just shadowing Schmidt.
Called my bluff.
Don't care - Ed?
Come meet Schmidt.
- Okeydokey.
That's the new guy?
"New" compared to what, the moon?
Here's what happened.
Gwen turned 45, so we had to fire her.
Obviously.
So, wait.
Gwen's job is available?
Yeah, but then grandma turned around and filed an ageism lawsuit, so we hired Bran Flakes here to cover our ass.
- Just do it.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Well, here I am.
- Okay.
I'm Schmidt.
I guess they wanted you to learn from the best.
Well, actually, they said your office was closest to the can.
I got a prostate the size of an avacada.
- "Closest to the can".
- Do not write that down, Winston!
Is it not closest to the can?
Yes!
Hey.
Whoa.
I stay sealed off during basketball season.
Plus, I, uh, dropped some olives under the bed, can't reach 'em.
Oh.
I got little pinchers.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yoom.
Hey, so I was gonna watch the, uh, Pistons of Detroit game.
Don't really have the reach for that.
Good thing I got legs.
- Wait.
You like the Pistons?
- Oh, yeah.
Just like you.
Are you serious?
!
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.
- Aw!
- So, you in?
- Be cool to watch it on a big TV.
- I found your olives.
- Oh, you did?
- Thought they were gonna be in a jar.
- No.
This is a big part of the biz, my man.
Networking, face time, making deals.
Normally, this would have a much sexier, businessman's vibe.
But not when I'm dragging around this old drooling potato.
Potata?
Yeah, I can split a baked potata.
What a life you must have lead.
Tell us about the street car, will you?
Oh, it was a dynamite way to get around.
- Mm-hmm.
- Pasadena to to the beach - Hey.
- I'll take another one of these.
- Sure.
- You know, Cece, I can't help but think that I am just following another bad lead with this marketing thing.
All I'm doing is taking a bunch of notes for Schmidt.
What's this?
"Seems befuddled and totally lucid"?
- "Smells too clean"?
- Those were just notes about Ed.
I'll tell you what.
That dude is way more interesting than marketing.
If I'm gonna take Gwen's job and become the next CIO of Ass-Strat, I can't just embrace modernization.
I got to make babies with it.
Do you know what I mean?
It's time to unveil my baby.
Micro-marketing.
Yeah, we target our messages directly to the individual consumer.
What a good idea.
They're gonna hold a ticker-tape parade for you in the Jewish part of town.
That's right.
In the Jewish part of town.
- Mm.
- Nothing but net.
Traditionally, "Nothing but net" refers to hitting nothing but inside of the net.
- Oh?
- Ah, so, yeah, no.
Oh, time-out.
Butt bump.
What?
- I'm ready.
- What?
The butt?
Oh.
- Come on.
- All right.
- Hey!
Hey!
What is that?
- It's the Pistons butt bump.
I didn't know your girlfriend was a Pistons fan.
That's got to suck for you, man.
But I guess everything sucks for you when you root for the Bulls.
- Butt bump!
Ah.
- Ah.
Ooh.
Oh, cool, cool, cool.
So you're a Pistons fan now, Jess?
- Suck it, Bulls!
- Yeah.
Suck it, Bulls!
The worst team in the League, the Bulls.
Oh, it's the worst team in the League, all right.
Who is the worst team in the League, Jess?
The Bulls.
The Bulls are the worst team in the League.
Hey.
So, went really well today.
I think Coach and I are really connecting.
Come on, what is that?
What do you mean?
What?
Oh, Coach gave this to me.
How cute is this shirt?
Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm gonna need you to get out of my bed.
- Why?
Because of the shirt?
- 100% because of the shirt.
Oh, my God, you're serious.
I can't have you in my bed in a Pistons shirt.
- Oh, my God!
- I need you to get out of the bed.
Jess, I need you to get out of there.
I tried being cool about it, but it's not cool.
- Really?
- Really.
Nick, it's just basketball.
Why are you taking this personally?
Because it's personal, Jess!
That's my team.
It's the city that I'm from.
It's most of my relationship with my dad.
R.I.P., by the way.
Michael Jordan.
The first man that taught me that I could love a man.
And the Pistons are our rivals.
They're like in Hamlet The McCalls and the Sh Hacksperes.
You're my girlfriend now, so You got to be a Bulls fan.
That's the whole point, Nick.
Coach just thinks of me as your girlfriend, and I want him to know me for me.
Do you want me to be friends with Coach?
I-I absolutely do.
Yes.
So, then, why can't I be a Pistons fan until we become friends, and then I'll switch to the Bulls?
So every year you can just pick a new team?
You meet a new friend, you're a fan of that?
- I could never trust you.
- Can we just have sex now, please?
I'm sorry.
You can't be a Pistons fan.
I forbid it.
- It has to be this way.
- You can't forbid me to do stuff.
That's just not you That's not within your power.
- I just did.
- The shirt stays!
Jessica, you're leaving me no options here.
I'm gonna have to turn off the tap.
- What tap?
- The sex tap.
But I need my vitamin D. As long as you're wearing that shirt, the tap is off.
- No more hot water.
- All right, fine, then.
My shirt and I will go sleep in my bed.
Oh.
What happened to your Pistons jersey?
Did you rip it off and rush in here 'cause she got to have it?
- Look, is this still a thing?
- Oh, it's still a thing.
No sex for you as long as you're a Pistons fan.
You can't use sex to manipulate What are you doing?
Just brushing my dirty teeth.
They're filthy.
Nick, do not challenge me to a sex standoff.
I can channel all my sexual energy into knitting.
How do you think I made it through high school?
It's good when you go fast and then slow.
Make the teeth wait for it.
You're on.
- Oh!
Yeah!
- Oh!
Yeah!
Turnover!
- Dunk it from the downtown!
- Go!
Go!
Go!
- Pass that pumpkin to Josh Smith.
- You better listen to my friend.
She knows exactly what she's talking about!
Did you just call me your friend?
What's up, guys?
Ah, two minutes in, and the Pistons are already down by ten.
What a drag.
What the heck are you wearing, dude?
Just my Scottie Pippens.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, I'm just checking up on you.
You frustrated at all?
- You need your vitamin D?
- No.
Jessica - Three-point play!
Yes!
- Oh, yeah!
- That's what I'm talking about!
- We are talking about the same thing My friend and I. Do my berries make you hungry?
Mmm.
Refreshing.
Just drink the water, Nick.
- You're turning yourself on now.
- I really am, yeah.
Okay, next order of business is Kim, if I may, uh, present an idea very quickly to the group.
- While I know - Micro-marketing.
What?
Has this company ever considered targeting its message to individual consumers?
Big data's knocking.
Let's open the door.
Just a thought.
Yeah, interesting.
Ed, look into that and present it to the board asap.
Great job.
I'd hug you, but you smell like a public library.
- What are you doing?
- I may be dirty, but I play old.
You said that wrong.
And yet I got my paw wrapped around your avacadas.
What is with you and avacadas?
Sorry.
You're never gonna believe what Ed just did.
He stabbed you in the back.
Winston, that's exactly what happened.
How did you do that?
I figured him out, Schmidt.
That liver spot out-sharked me.
Can you believe that?
I'm-I'm a minnow.
Tomorrow, Ed is gonna present my idea to the board, and then he's gonna get the get the promotion.
My career is toast.
Minnow toast.
Yeah, well, I tip my hat to him.
The minnow tips his tiny hat to the shark, and then lays down on the toast to be eaten.
There is too much going on in whatever metaphor you're trying.
- Okay?
It's too busy.
- Somewhat made se Oh, forget it.
- Ed wins.
I'm a mess.
- Hell, no, Schmidt.
Justice has to be served, all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.
Let us stop Ed.
The minnow needs to get up off of No, off of the toast mat and fish-fight his way to the orangutan ball.
I just don't understand why they keep giving these games away!
You know what it was?
It was that turnover in the third quarter.
- Right.
- Yeah.
I'll show you.
I can just take your word for it.
Actually, let's do it from the beginning.
You want to watch the game we just watched all over again?
- Mm-hmm.
- With both overtimes?
Great.
- Looking for somebody?
- Just doing a bed check.
And you are accounted for, so - See you.
- So, how's it going?
You guys bonding over basketball, Jess?
We're actually this close to moving past basketball and into real friendship, so - Great.
- I'm feeling pretty good about it.
After the Pistons lost, did he get really sad and talk to you about it?
About how he felt and you guys became besties after?
Or did that not happen because that's not the way men are?
The Pistons lost, so you must be feeling pretty good.
- Oh, I'm happy, yeah.
- Yeah?
- You're feeling excited?
- Mm-hmm.
- Worked up?
- Yeah.
Ready to cave?
- Oh, I've never been stronger.
- Oh, yeah?
So if I just read you a description of Like, what a Piston does, you know, on my phone, it wouldn't affect you at all?
Is that what you're saying?
It's just a rod that transfers, uh, force from the crank shaft What is this, a seduction class for kindergarteners?
Watch the master work.
How about this?
A little Paula Abdul stuff.
Yeah.
Are we doing this?
- Ha!
- What are you doing?
Ball's in my court now, pal.
I'm turning off my tap until you become a Pistons fan.
- Hey, that wasn't part of the deal.
- It is now.
I can't figure out my counterstrike, Winston.
The only thing we know about Ed is that he's old and cranky, and he baffles me because I'm so darn young and pleasant.
We just got to get inside into his old, cranky mind.
We have to find an older, crankier mind.
How are we gonna find an older, crankier mind than Ed?
Hey, where are you guys getting your photos developed these days?
I got these beefcake selfies that I want to dangle in front of Jess, get her engine revved up.
- Your phone has a camera, Nick.
- These are sexy, sensual, private pics.
I don't want them beamed right into Snowden's pocket.
I'm not going through Wikileaks, man.
It's not for me.
Analog.
It's the only thing you can trust.
You care to elaborate, you know, on this whole analog thing?
No, here's the reality, you never know what's gonna happen with a phone.
Right.
The hinges that hold the flip together, they get loosened over time when-when they get wet.
And then once you open it, it's easier for people to go in there and see your passwords and, you know, see your codes.
Once the screen breaks, your information's in the Twitterverse, man.
And it's all out there for everyone to see, all these little monkey elves, man, all these kids.
That's all they do.
Get your information, man.
Bottom line is you can't control your technology.
That's what's going on in Japan with all those robots.
Not for me, man.
That's why I trust a hard copy.
- Plain and simple.
- Hard copy, Schmidt.
- Nice work.
- Thank you.
And, Nick, you know, if you're gonna be taking boudoir shots, please consult me.
- I know.
- I have a series of poses that many people, including myself, find very sexy.
Okay, here's one that I call the half Nelson.
- Yeah, I didn't do that.
- This is called a Guy Fieri.
- Just taste the sauces.
- Yeah.
Black licorice.
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.
Schmidt's dead wrong.
- Oh, yeah?
- I got some real hot pics in here.
- I don't care.
- There's one of me as a sexy mayor, looking out the window, deciding the future of my city.
It's got to get her going.
Daddy needs his cookie.
Dude, just wear the damn Pistons jersey.
Oh, my God, I've got to end this.
What time is it?
!
Game time!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
It's my favorite time.
Other than medieval time.
All right.
- What the?
- What the?
- Let me see what's - Wait, no, I'll do it.
It's okay.
No!
Oh, my God, a mouse Rat or s Uh, some creature.
- I got to go watch it in my room.
- Wait, no, no, no.
Coach, Coach, Coach.
Look, since we can't watch the game, why don't we just - Have a nice, long chat over coffee?
- What?
- You know, just talk, hang out.
- What?
And then coffee turns to dinner, and dinner turns to weekly dinner, and before you know it, I'm best man at your beach wedding.
Do we have to?
We don't okay.
- You start.
- Me?
Hey, you want to do this over food?
Yes!
Yes!
No!
No, no, no, no!
No!
Come on!
Get your head out of your ass, so you can see where you're going, damn it!
Okay.
- What?
- I have to say it.
Coach, I I don't like basketball.
- What?
- There's, like, no fun parts.
There's no themes.
Men should not be wearing tank tops, ever.
Why were you pretending to like basketball?
'Cause I wanted to be friends with you.
Dude, you're my buddy's girlfriend.
We're watching the game.
What's the problem, dude?
What else do you want?
No, you're right.
I'm just, um I'm just Nick's girlfriend, so - Enjoy the game.
Okay.
- Where are you going?
I'm just, um - Jess - Where Jess!
Ladies, you all look like a hundred bucks.
I hope someone's taking you out for oysters Rockefeller tonight.
Now, before I begin, my little helper here will distribute some handouts for your reference.
Uh, you know what, Ed?
I'm really sorry.
Company printers are on the Fritz, so Little helper that I am, I decided to load everything up onto the laptop.
There you go.
Well, I'm sure there's a printer that works.
- I'll just wait for the hard copies.
- I broke all the printers.
I'm gonna beat you with an orange in a sock.
Besides, we're talking about technology, aren't we?
Be a little silly to talk about technology without using technology.
- Am I right, Kim?
- Use the technology, Ed.
Hup-I-dip-I-dip My left arm.
My neck.
You got me this time, Hebrew.
But I'll be back.
This is why the cutoff's at 45, ladies.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Jess!
You win!
I'm all backed up!
I've even been fantasizing about Winston!
Where is she, dude?
Don't do that laugh.
- What are you wearing, dude?
- It's for sex.
You like the Pistons.
Why don't you shut up, Coach?
- Where's Jess?
- What is up with that girl, dude?
One minute we're watching the game, the next she's, like, calling me a jerk and storming out of the place.
She just wants to be your friend.
Any idiot can see that.
We were being friends.
We were watching the game together.
- It was an awesome game.
- Okay, maybe she wants more than that.
Like what?
- You want to know a trick?
- Absolutely.
This is how you get in with Jess.
You know when you're driving in your car and you have a random thought, like "I wonder if seals are friends".
Yeah, or like "I really want to text right now, but there's a cop behind me".
- That's not the one I mean.
- "Why do T-Rex have little arms"?
Don't finish.
Don't f I know you, don't "If they get an itch in their crotch, how do they scratch it"?
I mean more like sweet, kind of emotional stuff.
Like, if you combed, you know, like, a gorilla's hair, would it like it?
Like I've never seen a baby pigeon before.
Exactly!
Tell that to her and you get a friend for life.
Now, excuse me.
Sex awaits.
Hey, Jess!
You win!
I want to take you!
Respectfully!
- Come here.
- Take that Jersey off.
Actually, leave it on.
- To Winston.
- Hear, hear.
As a thank-you, I'd like I'd like to get you a job at Ass-Strat.
I'll make you a real Ass man.
I don't know, man.
I kind of liked the part where we just get to analyze evidence, you know.
Connect the dots a little bit, yeah.
Live inside of someone else's mind.
- Spoken like a true marketing analyst.
- I don't know.
You know, I kind of want to be free of a desk as well.
Well roam the streets a little bit.
Just sniff out clues.
Let me ask you something.
- You guys get donuts in the morning?
- You ever thought of being a cop?
- Winston, I think you'd be great.
- I can see it.
You know, it's funny.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
You've already got high cholesterol and weird people skills.
- "Officer Bishop".
- I like the way that sounds.
It would be nice to retroactively justify that mustache.
It's a hell of a mustache.
What does that mean?
That was from a movie.
- Training Day's my favorite movie.
- I understand that, but you understand that's not what being a cop is.
I want to drop fools!
Huh?
That's what you're telling me?
If you think this means you can start yelling at me You damn right, sucker!
That's what that means.
Oh, I apologize about that.
Jess?
Jessica Day-hey-ey.
I just want to say that, um, I would love to be your friend.
Look, I know I'm crazy about the Pistons, but it's just because Detroit was the city I lived in the longest as a kid.
Yes.
I lived in, like, six different states by the time I was ten.
At a certain point, I just Stopped trying to make friends.
Got real comfy on that.
Really?
Lot easier saying bye to your buddy's girlfriend than it is your friend.
Well, I'm not gonna be saying good-bye to you anytime soon.
Except for right now.
You want to do a butt bump?
Butt Ah, you're probably doing your own butt bumps.
Cool.
I know you guys are already done.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
You're so funny!
Birthday Eve Cocktail.
Oh, my God.
You're my favorite bartender.
Thank you!
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Is it not good?
I'm still learning how to make drinks.
I'm better at shots.
Want a birthday shot?
I think I'm good.
So, any special birthday plans?
No, she's just gonna go to the movies alone, as usual.
No, I'm not, actually.
Uh, this year Nick asked me to spend the day with him.
That's so sweet.
I mean, what are you gonna do?
Something special?
Maybe.
You know, whatever Nick wants to do.
I'm not really a birthday person.
- Please.
- I do have a lot of expectations for people.
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.
"Made in China"?
!
Are you taking me to China?
!
And that's why, a long time ago, I decided that I would spend my birthday alone at the movies.
It's just safer, you know?
No getting your hopes up, no getting let down.
Well, I know how you feel about movies.
I mean, my parents took me to see Witness and then they never came back.
- What?
- I can really quote that movie though.
"Be careful out among them English".
But enough about me!
I am talking your ear off, lady, and it's your birthday.
This year's gonna be different.
Maybe Nick has something big planned, maybe not.
I'm gonna be chill.
No expectations.
Low maintenance.
No maintenance.
I'm just gonna be one of those cool girlfriends, like in the movies.
She just, like, has bed head and she wears, like, men's shirts and she's just like, "Yeah, cool.
"I'll wear, like, men's shirts and, like, sneakers and stuff.
And, like, I don't care about how I look".
Hey.
Hey.
She has no idea about the party.
Uh, Winston's STD-free.
- Whew!
It was a close call.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Close call, y'all.
Do you guys know how hard it's been for me to keep this party a secret?
Nick, it's been an inspiration, and that's why we're gonna help you cross that finish line, okay?
This is our Rudy.
Very condescending but thank you.
Right on.
All right, team check-in.
Coach, where we at with decorations?
- I forgot.
- Wait, what?
Psych!
I'm the best at stuff.
I don't forget stuff.
First place!
Wait.
Why are you first place?
I dominated on cake patrol.
And thank you for getting that cake.
You don't have to add the "patrol".
Decorations beats cake.
Uh, no.
Cake definitely beats decorations.
- Oh, really?
Let's do a word association game, okay?
- Yeah.
I'm in, I'm in.
- Birthday.
- Decorations.
Wait, what'd I say?
Okay, Schmidt, are you ready to transport all electronics to the party venue?
By "electronics," you mean this itty-bitty flash drive that I can fit in my pocket and that is light as air?
I need a verbal confirmation.
You insult me.
Yes.
Cece, you ready to cover my shift tomorrow with Mike?
Born ready.
Yes.
Oh.
You're giving your Saturday to Cece?
That's cool.
That's really wonderful.
Can you tell I'm being sarcastic?
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, it's pretty clear.
- I'm ready.
You set fire to soda water.
Who does that?
How do you even possibly do that?
It's not a flammable thing.
It's not even Are you a witch?
Mike I hate all of you hipsters so much Okay, and I'm gonna be on Jess Watch.
I'm gonna make sure she doesn't see anything that will ruin the surprise of this party that has taken everything from me, emotionally and physically and financially.
So what do you have planned for the day?
A big surprise party.
Next.
Right, but before then.
The party's at 7:00.
What do you have planned b-before that?
- Wait - Nick, you need a plan, okay?
I don't care what Jess says.
She's going to expect something.
I have to plan a birthday before the birthday?
The whole day is the birthday.
This is a very big deal.
This is your first birthday together as a couple.
All right, you know what?
It's gonna be okay.
It's her birthday.
That girl's gonna want to sleep in.
My day is not starting till noon.
This is the time I was born.
I'm wide awake.
It's my birthday.
My day started earlier than I thought.
I got to slow down breakfast.
What's going on with you guys?
Nick, first of all, blessings.
Um, second of all, there may have been a possible mix-up with the cake.
Possibly.
"See You in Hell, Boomer"?
Oh, my God What part of you thought this was Jess's cake?
I thought it was an inside joke.
- I'll do the cake.
- No, I am the cake patrol.
Both of you do the cake.
I'm considering this problem solved.
Hey, speaking of problems, do you want me to go check up on Cece at the bar today?
I don't think that's necessary.
All right, I'll do it.
But you owe me one, bro.
I need to make a 90-minute omelet.
I love my birthday breakfast.
I can't believe you were gonna make this all yourself.
It would've taken you hours.
I know.
And with your help, it took six minutes.
I know.
I'm so fast.
What do you say we go into my bedroom and, uh, slow things down?
Ooh.
Wow.
That's the fastest it's ever taken.
I know.
You just look very pretty.
So, you want to take a long nap?
Oh.
Um If that's what you have planned, then, yes, let's take a long nap.
Perfect.
Maybe for, like, six, seven hours?
It's just such a nice day outside Yeah.
Um, so let's take, uh let's take this party outside.
- Sure.
- Next up on the agenda is it's lunch.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
Oh, my God, it's so early.
What are you doing here, Schmidt?
Nick thought you might need some help.
Yeah, well, I don't, okay?
So you can go.
Maybe I'll just stay for a little bit.
Double-tap some Insta-G's.
Okay.
Oh, hey, Mike.
I cleaned the glasses.
Oh, wow, a bunch of broken glass in the ice tub.
- That'll be fun for me to clean up.
- I'm sorry.
Um I'm not gonna cover for you like Nick does, okay?
I promise you that.
And don't make eyes at me because it's not gonna work because I'm super gay.
When I look at you, I just see You know, it's fine, but it's bumpy, it's creepy.
Eh.
Doesn't do anything.
It's like looking at this, it's like a it's it's it's it's it's it's not o it's not a good it's not good.
- Okay.
- This, all this, everything you got, eh.
Three out of six.
Damn shame about that cake, Winston.
Looks like someone dominated their party task.
"Coach, where are all the kazoos"?
All over your face.
I'll pick those up.
Or maybe in my spare time I'll make a cake.
Just back off, Coach.
What's up, Nick?
- How's the cake situation?
- Cake's good.
Can I just see the phone?
- Can I see the phone really quick?
Got it.
- Dude, get Hey.
Cake's good, man.
I'm on top of it.
So, how's your plan working out?
Okay, I have no plan.
I'm just winging it, okay?
I panicked and took her to a drugstore.
She's getting a free diabetes test.
I don't know where to take her.
Is it safe to bring her home?
- Hey.
- Oh!
The birthday girl!
I got the test.
My blood sugar is normal.
Already?
You did that all that already?
- Yeah.
- Birthday girl gets, all your favorite Next activity.
I see what you're trying to do here, man.
You're trying to show me up.
What are you talking about, Bish?
I'm referring to basketball.
When we used to play back in the day, no matter how open I was, you never passed me the ball, you never let me shoot.
You just couldn't stand to let me shine.
Your nostrils are flaring so much right now, it's distracting.
I'm done letting you run the court.
I'm building my own court.
And it's gonna be bigger and yummier than yours.
Are you challenging me to a bake-off, Bish?
Yes, I am challenging you to a bake-off.
Okay.
Well, then, I'll do the countdown.
You know what?
I'll do the countdown then.
The countdown begins when this timer goes off.
You set the timer for 20 minutes.
I'm gonna make a cake so moist, girls are gonna be, like, "Ew.
Why do you say moist?
I hate that word".
I'm gonna be, like, "Just taste the cake".
And they're gonna be, like, "Damn, it's moist"!
And - - Bake!
- Okay, bake!
- I said it first.
- I said it first.
- I said it first.
- I said it first.
A customer ordered an old-fashioned, and she got gin in a mug with a peanut in it.
- I'll fix it.
- Make me an old-fashioned right now, or I'm gonna call the manager.
And I want to talk to him anyway, because he's just gorgeous.
I want to be a barnacle on his ship.
Just hanging on by my mouth, getting all the nutrients I need.
Okay, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned, an old-fashioned.
If it's old-fashioned, it probably has something like - absinthe - Oh, the old-fashioned.
One of my favorite drinks; a classic cocktail.
Just a half ounce of simple syrup.
Splash of water, two dashes of bitters.
Mix that up with some ice.
And then, you know my personal favorite.
You know, and just, far be it from me, but the bourbon whiskey.
- Bourbon.
- Two ounces of bourbon whiskey.
No.
Hmm.
- It's not the Scotch whiskey.
- It's No, it's certainly not the vermouth.
Vermouth would be insane.
Yes, the bourbon whiskey.
My favorite.
Wonderful.
Look at that.
Old-fashioned.
Hmm.
Old-fashioned?
Oh, my stars and garters, you made a drink.
Holy crud.
Yes, Nick!
I have the electronics!
Do you know any, like, time-consuming and free activities in Griffith Park?
Gross!
Suicide?
Schmidt, please.
I need some a Well, just figure it out, dude!
- Oh, it's my mom.
- Okay, um, found the biggest rock I could carry.
It was this one.
Um - It's heavy.
- It's huge.
Yeah, heavy.
Oh, my God.
Um what are we doing here?
It's not that I'm not having fun, 'cause I am.
It's okay if you didn't plan anything for my birthday.
Are you kidding?
!
Really, Nick.
Not only did I plan something, but my plan's about to blow your mind.
- Honestly.
- You need to trust me a little bit.
'Cause everything is about to be made very clear - very soon.
- Oh, my God!
What?
Nick!
- You're the best.
- I'm amazing.
- I'm so surprised!
- I'm so surprised.
- This is amazing!
- It's amazing!
- This is amazing!
Yay!
- Oh, son of a bitch!
Don't touch anything!
- It'll ruin the surprise!
Yeah.
- Yay!
Yes.
- Yeah !
- Yay!
- Hey, Jess, let's get out of here before anything ruins this perfect moment.
I wouldn't t Wait because we've got a whole, uh, ceremony.
No!
That lady took my birthday!
What is happening?
- Jess!
Look, look, I'm sorry, Jess.
- No, no, no, Nick, I just I don't know why I get so crazy about birthdays.
You know, it's crazy, 'cause you had a very fun day put together.
Eggs and sex and and a really long uphill walk.
And, um look, um, that's amazing for you, you know?
For me?
You're not a guy who plans things.
- Maybe I am.
- Look every day, you show me, in your own way, how you care about me.
Like when you pick up rubber bands on the sidewalk.
- For your ponytail.
- I could not be more fine.
I'm super chill.
I'm just gonna go home for a second.
- Bye.
- Jess, let's keep Jess!
Don't follow me.
- Sure you know how to tap a keg?
- How hard could it be?
It's beer, for crying out loud.
It's the drink of idiots.
- Wait.
Nick told me something about - Cece, look, I got I got it.
- Ooh, there's a knob back here.

He told me if I turn this, I shoulde able to - Oh!

- Oh, sorry!
It's just - Turn it off!
You butt hole.
You can't do anything right, can you?
I'm so sorry.
He's right, though.
I can't do anything.
No skills.
I told you this, but I didn't even graduate high school.
A lot of people never graduated high school.
Okay Einstein, Bill Gates, Anne Frank.
I'm gonna take back that last one.
Why did I think that I could bartend?
Because you can.
You are strong, and you are confident.
Those are skills.
Use them.
And be a little bit meaner to the people here.
It should be easy for you.
Just pretend that they're me.
You're right.
That is easy.
And pull your shirt down a little bit.
This isn't a monastery.
Do not push your luck with me.
I'll look away.
You're wearing paper towels.

I'm really fine.
It had a real day, you know.
I'm disappointed in Nick.
Yeah, you got to let that out, you know, 'cause But I'm disappointed in myself because I'm disappointed in Nick, you know.
Oh, I feel you.
Yeah, that's messed up.
- Yeah, let it out.
Let it out.

Jess - No, no, no Hey.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
Want you to close your eyes, breathe deep, and go to the most magical place on earth your imagination.
Have you guys been baking?
Ah, nah.
Bakery downtown exploded.
Don't look into it.
It's not on the Internet.
Yeah.
She is here.
What happened?
She doesn't think I can do anything or plan anything, and it feels like crap.
Maybe she's right.
Why did I think I could pull this off?
I'm pretty sure I'm having a heart attack.
And I haven't arranged for anybody to clear my Internet history.
I wasn't building a bomb!
I was just curious.
Nick, you got a whole team of friends pulling for you, okay?
Just get yourself home.
You can still pull this off.
Hey, Mike.
-What?
- So I cleaned out the beer trap, I polished all these wine glasses, and I turned that penis graffiti in the bathroom into a whimsical hat.
Now my friend and I have to go to a party.
All right, Schmidt, let's go.
You called me your friend.
Did I?
And now, look, no matter what we see in here, I just want you to know that it's been an honor working with you.
You, too, man.
Wow, look at that.
Oh, my God.
Oh, man.
Our, uh cakes merged.
Looks as if they have.
Yeah.
Well Hey!
Team check-in.
Where we at?
Our cake became double cake.
Yeah.
Two cakes.
Yeah.
Two cakes became one?
- Two cakes, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.
Fantastic, I'll go get Jess.
- Cool.
- Nice.
Hey, Jess.
Hey, guys!
What's up, man?
She's at the movies.
This might actually work.
- At the what ?
- Come on!
More, more.
More.
Uh and, okay.
I think we're good.
Same to the second one.
Hey, Jess, it's, uh, Nick.
You obviously knew that.
Um, I know this is where you always go on your birthday to be by yourself, but I thought this year you might want a little company.
Mind if I sit?
Look under the seat.
Now please read the card, I'll wait.
How did you know I was gonna be sitting here?
I put one under every seat, - but you got to go fast, 'cause of the timing.
- Okay.
"My name is Jess, I like to wear tights.
It's dark in this room, so let's turn on the lights".
Surprise!
Whoo!
That's enough.
Timing, guys, timing.
In the beginning, there was nothing, and then there was light and dark and oceans and birds and stuff and then there was Jess!
Nick?
This was the plan all along?
What do I think of when I think of Jess?
When I think of Jess.
Okay When I think about Jess I think of how sweet she is and how smart she is.
uh, is glasses and the hair thing.
think of dance parties and sleepovers Jess does not like being tackled.
The eyes, two eyes.
Happy birthday, Ms. Day.
Your youthful exuberance exhausts me.
May it fade with each passing year.
Well, she made me try papayas.
That was cool.
They're super soft inside.
Jess is the upstairs lady.
There is a there is a ma I fell like I'm not doing this right.
You make mistakes.
Happy birthday to my best work friend.
Tina, if you see this, I'm sorry.
I just feel like we drifted apart after Jeremy's cocaine thing.
It was awkward.
"When the stirrups of life start to feel like the speculum of old age " Nick, I'm not reading this.
This is terrible.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Your boyfriend is sweet and simple and will not get out of my waiting room.
I saw a squirrel once.
It looked like Jess.
Then it attacked my sister, So I had to beat it with a stick, and then it didn't look like Jess anymore.
Happy birthday.
It's Bearclaw.
Birthday Winston is about to do some He said a bunch, but it was really weird and racist.
Happy birthday, Ms. Day.
Yay!
What I remember most of all is the pain.
Honestly, it was 36 hours more than that of just searing, ripping, and then Out you came, the most beautiful, beautiful little baby I ever saw in my life.
And I forgot all the pain.
When you were born, I got a deli sandwich at the hospital cafeteria.
And then there was a baby.
Happy birthday to my oldest and my best friend.
Happy birthday, Ms. Day.
Happy birthday.
Birthday.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday from Bearclaw.
I love you.

And I always have it.
Happy birthday, Jess.
Happy birthday to you Cha, cha, cha.
Happy birthday to you Ooh, ooh Happy birthday dear Jess Um hmm, where'd Where'd she ?
Where'd ?
Hey, Jess, I'm so sorry.
That was cheesy, embarrassing.
I didn't have great talent to work with.
Winston was terrible.
It's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
And I'm sorry.
Shh, shh.
It's starting.
Happy birthday, Jess.
- That was so stupid, dude.
- Oh, what is wrong with you?
Ashamed of yourself.
- Come on, Schmidt.
- Quit it.
- Boo.
- No!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- All right!
- Yes!
Don't touch my shin every time there's a big play.
- Yeah, no, I got it.
Oh, yes!
- Don't touch it every time!
Hey, man, stop.
- Oh!
- Oh!
There it is!
- No!
- Hey, Nick.
Um, Jess left her panties in the dryer.
- You mind if I move 'em?
- Sure, man, I don't care.
Wait a second.
Why do you ask?
You're not gonna move them in a weird way or something, are you?
No, dude, I'm just trying to be respectful, that's all.
You know, before you and Jess were together, I moved her panties hundreds of times, so - Wait, what?
- Hundreds of times?
What, are you just hanging around the-the dryer like some sort of panty-hawk?
- What?
- Panty-hawk.
I'd watch that show.
So should I just go move them, or Nick, he's being weird.
You gotta move 'em.
Oh, so now I'm the panty mover?
Yeah, you're the boyfriend.
- That's not a life!
- Who the hell is gonna move the panties?
Coach, you move 'em.
Are they warm from the dryer?
You know what?
You're out.
- Grow up.
I'll move the panties.
- Thank you.
Ooh, seems awfully eager.
Yeah, you're awfully eager, here, Schmidt.
Oh, yeah.
I been waiting my entire life to move your girlfriend's panties Stop saying "panties," bro.
Panties.
No, they're panties.
With a "D".
Pandies.
Pandies.
Say "panties" like a normal person.
No, this is how black people say it.
Pull your "pannies" down.
- No "T" in there.
- We say "pannies".
Yeah.
Here's how a white dude says it.
Pull your panties down.
Guys, honestly, can you not see what the panties are doing to us?
Stop saying "panties" when it comes to Jess, everybody.
This is exactly why none of us should live with a woman.
I've got an idea.
You guys are never gonna believe what You know what?
I don't care.
The most amazing thing just happened.
Whoa!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Watch where you're going!
- Oh, boy.
- Sorry.
Sorry, my bad.
We thought we were gonna die, but she was actually really sorry.
So she invited us to a party at her boss's house, and they're sending a limo, and guess who her boss is.
- It's Prince!
- It's Prince!
- It's Prince.
It's Prince.
- Prince!
It's Prince!
- What?
- Oh!
Prince?
- Nice!
We're going to a party at Prince's house, - We're going to a party - We're going!
at Prince's house.
We're going!
That's not my underwear.
Which shoes should I wear to Prince's house, white or black?
White, or black?
Nick, come on.
The limo's gonna be here any minute.
Which shoe?
White or black?
Well, I think you look great in everything.
I just want this moment to end.
What are your open-toe options?
None of it works, okay?
We gotta start over.
Let's go.
You failed, bro.
Man, I am glad I'm not going to that party.
Too much pressure, am I right?
Dude, in high school, going to a Prince party would've been your dream come true.
You were obsessed.
So tonight we're gonna party Like it's 1999!
My mother had to cut those pants off me, they were so tight.
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to celebrate this thing called Schmidt.
- Nick, are you wearing cargo pants?
- Yeah.
You're gonna wear those to an A-list party?
Hey, guys, how are we going to transport all this cargo?
Oh, wait, we have Nick's pants.
We're saved.
Get the frickin' pants off.
Dude, we're not going.
Prince invited the hot girls, not the four dudes.
What?
Why did I buy this $2,000 suit?
You idiot!
Dude, my suit cost $200, and mine came with socks stapled to the lapel.
- Not gonna tap that.
- I'm not gonna 'Cause it came with it.
- Cheap suit.
- Yeah, but it came with socks.
Unacceptable!
This party was supposed to take me to the next level.
- Next level of what?
- Don't ask, man.
In every man's life, there is one party that changes everything.
Oh.
You don't understand.
And that is exactly why I'm leaving you all behind.
So this whole time, you've just been waiting for cooler friends?
Yes.
Of course.
Coach, look around.
This can't be the finish line.
Here she is.
Whoa!
You look great!
Why is Schmidt dressed up?
I don't want to talk about it.
Prince!
Unbelievable!
Hey, look!
I'm in a limo!
I wish I had really long legs so I could stretch 'em out the length of the limo.
Well, have fun.
I love you.
Hmm Mm-hmm.
Did Nick just tell me - he loved me for the first time?
- Yeah.
And did I do finger guns back?
Yeah, you did.
- No - Yes.
Oh You're gonna want to drink all of this.
- Oh, oh!
- Hey, driver, we're gonna need some more champagne!
Ah.
Okay.
So Yeah Dude, a man never says it first, okay?
Well, it wasn't my plan to tell her, it just slipped out.
She looked so pretty.
Well, Nick, is that how you feel?
I mean, do you love her?
Of course I do.
But I wasn't gonna say it like that.
I was gonna wait, Winston.
You blurted it out.
It's not a big deal.
That's what I always do.
I love you!
Sometimes they say it back, sometimes they don't I mean, it's like a numbers game.
I always do this.
I always get too intent, and then I freak girls out.
I blew it.
What do I do?
Well, Nick, you can't take it back.
Well, that's not 100% true.
Damn!
Prince's house!
Not bad, Prince!
You think Prince has a pool?
You think he has a drawbridge?
We're never gonna get in.
We're not even in a limo.
Uh, excuse me, we're in a Ford Fusion, the best car ever made.
It gets double the gas mileage of - Again?
- Shut up.
That's all you've been talking about the whole drive, and it's weird.
You get sexual when you talk about it.
It's in your eyes.
I don't like it.
Double the gas mileage means you go double as far.
- Double as long.
- Shut up!
I'll let you borrow this, dude, and you'll feel it.
- You'll know what I'm talking - Why don't I feel it right now?
- Feel it.
- Oh, cowabunga!
- You felt it?
- I'm gonna punch you in the face.
Just drive the car.
You've never been turned on by gas mileage before?
- Never.
- No!
- Once.
- When was that?
- It was a Thursday, that's all I remember.
- A Thursday?
- Yeah.
Just drive the car.
I gotta go tell my girlfriend I don't love her - so she doesn't leave me.
- All right.
Like a normal person.
Amazing.
Can you believe it?
No, I can't.
Finger guns?
That was so stupid.
My brain just froze.
If the limo guy hadn't pulled away, I probably would've done a lasso.
I think you were just a little scared.
Scared of what?
Saying "I love you"?
I say "I love you" all the time.
I'll say it right now: I love you!
I love you.
Hi, I'm Clayton Kershaw.
I'm a Los Angeles Dodger.
Yeah, and I'm Jessica Day.
I'm a Los Angeles astronaut.
Not now, pal.
- He's never gonna let us in.
- So what do we do?
Pull it together.
I need this as much as you do.
My new life is waiting for me in that party.
Guys, look, I can't help but think that now might be a good time for a little Fire and Ice.
- Oh!
Fire and Ice!
- Please, do not There is never - a good time for Fire and Ice.
- Yes!
Yeah!
Fire and Ice got you into parties in college, but it's not getting you into Prince's house.
Winston, what happens when you mix fire and ice?
Warm water, baby.
This is embarrassing.
- It's bubbling.
- It's bubbling, baby!
- Warm water!
- Warm water!
- Warm water!
- Warm water!
Um, yeah, I'm on the list.
Ernie!
Winnie?
!
Winston L. Bishop.
Ernie, is that really you?
Oh, my goodness!
Come here, man!
My God, it's so good to see you!
This guy saved my life, man.
No, you saved my life.
Let me ask you something, man.
You still keep in contact with Freddy?
Freddy didn't make it.
Freddy's gone?
No!
Come on!
No!
No, man!
- We ain't crying.
- No, you cry, I cry.
This is a great night.
Hope nothing ruins it.
That's nice to see.
Come on, you guys.
For Freddy.
For Freddy.
- That's remarkable.
- That worked?
We need our own Fire and Ice, pal.
Well, all right, man.
Ham and Cheese!
I don't really think the name made a Ham and Cheese!
- Nick!
Well, we should rehearse!
- Excuse me.
Excuse me!
- What?
!
Who's this guy?
- Nick Miller?
- Is that Schmidt?
- You scoundrel, you.
Well, hot damn.
Come here.
It's good to see you.
Yeah, well, the feeling's not mutual!
The last time I saw him, I was on the desert, and he was putting my mother into a prison.
You don't understand what we're doing, do you?
Keep this animal away from me!
You know what?
It's my fault.
We didn't rehearse.
We didn't rehearse.
Can we come into the party?
You know what?
We're gonna wait back here.
I get it.
It's my fault.
It's - Nick?
- I'm Trojan horsing inside a bunch of models.
- Every ham for himself.
- No, Nick!
Let me in there!
Models, let me in, please.
- No, sir.
- Unhand me!
Jess?
Hey, there you are.
Excuse me.
- Jess.
- Nick, hi!
What are you doing here?
!
- I'm so happy to see you!
- Yeah.
How'd you get in?
- I need to talk to you.
- I know.
I can't leave it the way that was.
I know, because there's something, um, I really should have said back there and I didn't, and, um I think it's important that I say to you.
So, uh, what I wanted to say is, Nick Miller I Jess!
She's all right.
Hey, Jess, you okay?
Hi.
What happened?
You had a panic attack and you fell down.
Oh, my God Which is actually worse than finger guns.
I didn't think that was possible.
I think it's fair to say that I did not handle the situation very well.
No, look, it's fine.
In fact, I want to take the whole thing back, Jess.
What?
I shouldn't have said it, it was an accident and, uh yeah, so just kind of clear the air.
No!
No, Nick!
This just got very awkward.
Be strong, Nick!
What did?
What?
- What's that?
- I'm outside the hedge!
You see my arm?
I'm trying to push through!
What are you doing up there?
Be careful!
I lost my bearings!
I had to go high to avoid the spiders!
- Nick - Just wait for him to finish.
I'm breaching!
- Uh - Whoa!
Easy!
Easy!
Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
Prince is terrible at Frisbee.
There's, like, ten of these things up there.
Hey, guys, can I talk to Nick alone for a second?
You got it.
Yeah.
You're taking it back?
Is that how you really feel?
Well how do you feel?
Hi.
I'm Prince.
So what seems to be the problem?
Oh, how rude of me.
I haven't given you enough time to freak out yet.
You may do so now.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Nick!
So, I'm not familiar with this term "finger guns".
Can you elaborate?
Uh, yeah, it's a Whoa.
Don't point those at me.
They might go off.
That was very much of your flavor of humor.
Listen, Nick, uh Nick, right?
Yes, that's my name.
Jess and I are gonna take a moment to just be alone.
I'm-I'm not worried, but why?
What are you gonna talk to her about?
You.
Nick, I never thought I'd say this, but I need to be alone with Prince.
All right, well Yeah.
So, do you like pancakes?
Ooh, ooh.
Cece, help!
The bouncer's after me.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
He's gone.
He's gone, Schmidt.
- Is he gone?
- Mm-hmm.
You can stop now.
He's tenacious.
He's definitely gonna be back.
Pretty sure it's all clear.
It's always good to see old friends.
Thank you.
So, tonight's the night we're just gonna leave this all behind and get cooler friends, right?
Yeah, right.
We should be dead.
We should be dead.
I never thought I was gonna see him again!
He's getting emotional right now, because this is real.
Oh, if you cry, I'm gonna cry.
And then I'm gonna cry, then we can just cry together.
Poor Freddy.
Jess is with Prince!
And I've been drinking.
Wait Jess is with Prince?
And I've been drinking.
Who are these two?
Come on, man.
Fire and Ice, dude.
Get out.
- It's getting warm in here isn't it?
- Yes.
It's actually a little chilly.
We're Oh, give me a break.
I see what you're doing.
Mm-mm.
You're trying to tempt me sexually.
Not interested.
What are you doing, Nick?
That leads to me taking my jacket off, and all of a sudden, you guys got me in my underwear, huh?
I'm not a dummy.
Take a walk.
No one's interested.
- So rude.
How idiotic.
- We got business.
Rude?
No, no, no, no, no, no, stay, stay, stay.
- Let's go.
- Idiot!
Yeah, I'm an idiot.
- Ciao.
- No, no, no ciao!
No ciao.
You'll be replaced by robots before you can say, "Fragi-cava-licious".
You're bringing Fire and Ice down!
Yeah, man.
You don't bring Fire and Ice down.
Don't start with me right now.
I'm having a terrible day.
Who cares about them?
Who cares?
I care!
I feel like dancing right now.
Dancing's not the answer.
You can't dance.
It's only gonna get worse.
Let's tear the roof off this joint, and show Prince how we do!
Thanks, Charles.
You want to know why you can't tell that nice dude you love him?
I want to say it, but You're scared.
Exactly.
If you say it and things don't work out, what then?
I really care for him.
And I'm just worried I'm gonna lose him.
That's stupid.
You're stupid.
I forgive you.
- Oh, my God, thank God!
- Besides anything beautiful is worth getting hurt for.
Well, that's very well put.
You know who said that?
No.
Me.
You're good.
God.
I wish I were more like you, Prince.
Finish your pancake.
Let's get to work.
Oh, it's really good.
But I'm super full.
- Pancake.
- Okay.
Here, put this on.
Oh, that's beautiful, but I don't think I could pull that off.
Don't argue with me.
Okay.
Repeat after me.
- Love.
- Love.
- Love.
- Love.
What am I supposed to be learning here?
- Love.
- Love.
- Love.
- Love.
You're not saying it right.
Do you understand now?
Yes, I think I do.
What about now?
No.
No.
Look in there.
Wait, stop, no!
I'm afraid of the dark!
I said stop being afraid.
Boo.
Yeah!
This is what sexy is!
So, what do you think?
I think you need to go find Nick.
I don't know how to thank you.
Shh.
I honestly didn't hear a word you said.
Okay.
Okay, gotcha.
This is your party now.
- To the VIP room?
- Yeah.
With the two of you?
You can't handle it!
You can't beat me!
Come on.
You've got it.
Boy, you don't got it.
You can't do it.
- You're gonna do it.
- Three - You can't do it.
Two - He's gonna do it!
Come on, now, you can get it.
Winnie, don't give up.
- What?
- Damn it.

New record.
That's not even the game!
Nick Miller!
Hey, Jess.
I'm not sorry that I said it.
I hate to say this, but I couldn't hear you 'cause it's very loud.
I love you!
I love you, Nick Miller!
What the hell are you wearing?
Prince dressed me.
Awesome!
Yeah!
Anybody want to fall in love tonight?
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Fall in love tonight She said Special night, my favorite tune The moon threatened to dance her out of her shoes Out of my shoes In his ear was about to hear An awful thought he could not refuse She said - Don't - Don't Don't you wanna Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight She said Underneath the taffeta There ain't no better hiding place Hiding place If I see the moon, I'll just laugh it up Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah - Want to wake up - Wake up To your, your pretty face - Don't - Don't - Don't you wanna - Don't you wanna Wanna fall in love tonight?

So we just danced with Prince?
- With Prince.
- Yeah.

Jess, how did you know the words?
I think Prince is magic.
I've always thought Prince was magic.
Where do we go from here?
How do we move on from this?
Just go to work tomorrow?
Wait a minute.
Where's Cece?
- I'll take it easy on you.
- Thank you.
You want to put some money on this?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
This is why I buy my food from gas stations, Jess.
Nick, you knocked over a wheelbarrow full of fruit, and then you actually skipped away.
Guys, I'm trying to concentrate, okay?
The LAPD does not offer entrance exams every single day.
Just Mondays and Fridays.
But I am not waiting till Friday.
Hey, why do you have so much fruit?
Because this one ran into his ex-girlfriend at the farmer's market.
Nick?
Hey!
No way!
Caroline of my past.
What a pleasant surprise.
My ex-lover No!
I don't deal with exes.
They're part of the past.
You burn 'em swiftly and you give their ashes to Poseidon.
I'm really good friends with Berkley, and we had a terrible breakup Come on, what?
You have a good relationship with him because he wants to bone you.
He's a stay-at-home dad.
His entire life revolves around his family.
He's the most emotionally evolved person I know.
And I'm sure his favorite emotion is the emotion of wanting to bone you.
That's not an emotion.
Possible sex is the only reason people stay "friends" with their exes.
- Come on.
- Back me up, Winnie the Bish.
Yeah, that's true.
I mean, I'm friends with all my exes - See?
- families.
Ha-ha!
See?
I still send Shelby's dad a Father's Day card, and he still sends me five bucks on my birthday.
- What is wrong with you?
- That's nice.
- Hey, guys.
- I bet Coach is friends with his exes.
- No.
- Oh, for sure, yeah.
- Yeah!
I'm right!
- For sex.
- No!
Ha-ha!
I'm right!
Can't spell "sex" without the "ex".
Man, is that sexy when he does that.
Announcement: I finally finished my loft.
Hold the applause.
Let's go.
All right.
Come on.
C-Come on, you guys.
All together, now.
We're not Who's coming?
Let's go.
Come on, Nick.
I don't want to go, man.
Thanks for the invite.
Nah, come on.
Winnie.
No?
You and Caroline still need some closure.
Well, what do you want me to say?
That I walked out on her and now I'm dating you?
We started dating, like, a year after you broke up.
Yeah, but that doesn't matter with her.
She's got a crazy streak, and this is bound to set her off.
What if she hurts me physically?
What if she hurts me with words?
Just talk to her.
Clear the air.
You'll feel better, she'll feel better.
Besides, Nick, I can't give up that farmer's market.
Strolling around, chatting with vendors It's so nice.
I feel like Don Corleone.
I think a lot of ladies do.
Hey.
Hey Sorry about that.
Haven't spoken anybody all day.
Phlegm buildup, you know?
I've been cooped up all day in my loft apartment.
So much space for one person, you know?
You could scream in there, nobody would ever hear you.
I'm gonna go.
Bye.
What is going on?
May I speak plainly with you, Cecilia?
I'm in a bit of a sexual drought.
The Good Valley Schmidt hasn't seen rain in months.
You're just you're giving off a creepy vibe.
All right?
Living alone is messing up your game and it's making you weird.
Yeah, but I love living alone.
Where are you, grapes?
Grápés.
Great apes.
Grapes, we have you surrounded.
Come out with your stems up!
I guess my game could be upped if I increased my my human contact - a little bit.
- Good.
Because you're caressing your own arm right now.
Hmm.
That's not normal, man.
I've been working out.
It feels I don't I just want to know why you walked out.
Was there something else going on?
Was there someone else?
Can I just say, I really wish this coffee was a giant beer.
And I wish this scone was a-a whiskey and I could just drink one just chase 'em.
This is nice.
Glad we're doing this.
So how'd it go?
We gabbed like a couple of washer women over the back fence.
That's great.
So proud of you.
You two are dating?
I knew it.
I knew it was her!
What?
You didn't tell her we were together?
!
I told her we were together.
I'm not getting away with this.
I didn't tell her.
Screw you, Miller!
I don't understand.
You guys talked for 30 minutes.
- How did our relationship not come up?
- 'Cause I got scared.
There were so many things that I wanted to tell her.
You ever thought how weird it would be if you just gave up your thumb?
You just didn't have a thumb.
I mean, how would you give a thumbs up?
Just like this?
I think a guy died in the building, 'cause one day in the Dumpster is a bunch of clothes that just fit me.
What I like to do now is take the Underground, yeah?
Spend my quid.
Cheers?
Oh, crap.
This is her.
She thinks I cheated, Jess.
You know who you should talk to?
Berkley.
He's so good at this stuff friendship, closure.
Actually, he did write a book about it.
It's an e-book.
I gave it four stars, but it kind of falls apart at the end.
He goes into God in a way I don't think he needs to.
You know what?
I'm gonna text him?
Why would I talk to your ex-boyfriend about my ex-girlfriend?
Well, you need his help.
- You're right.
Give me.
Can I see?
- No, no, no.
- Can I see?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
"Hey, babe" Don't call him "babe".
It's just what we call each other.
"BF problems"?
My boyfriend is having problems.
- XOXO?
- It's a really common greeting.
"Kissing you, hugging you, kissing you, hugging you"?
What else am I gonna write?
"O-O-O"?
That just looks like "Oh" You're leading him on, Jess.
- Oh, Nick.
- You are.
Berkley's really gonna teach you a lot.
Men don't talk to people they've dated unless they want sex, or they're Winston.
- I also want sex.
- Going to Schmidt's.
He's been begging us to all week.
Jess, men are sick.
Look, I'm a relatively good guy, but even I'm a sicko.
Luckily, we have the Internet as a community of Oh, this is terrible!
She's quoting scriptures, but using tons of cuss words.
- This is as bad as it gets with Caroline.
- Okay.
Berkley's around the corner at his baby's world music class.
Okay, you know what?
I'm in.
- Great.
- What kind of beer does Berkley like?
- He doesn't.
- Oh, great.
I cannot wait to meet him.
Fellas.
You made it.
As promised, here's a coupon for a free sub.
Yup.
Probably get ham.
Wow, man.
- It's nice inside of here, man.
- Yeah.
It's like a European airport.
Oh, what's that?
Uh, you want to watch the game?
Which one?
Basketball?
Football?
Of Thrones?
Oh!
That is awesome, man.
Look at this place, Schmidt.
You got so many plush surfaces.
Well, there are 15 different bang spots in here, each one specifically designated to its own sexual position.
Mm.
That's standing, this is sitting, that's diagonal.
That's how I do it.
The "Why?
Why?
Because".
The "Closure of the Lincoln Tunnel".
The "Red Beanbag Chair".
Which is pretty obvious, but, you know, that's a good one.
The "Glass Menagerie".
- The "Bike Share".
- Nice.
The "Backwards Oops".
What is "backwards oops"?
You don't want to put it mm.
You don't know what it means.
I mean, I don't I've done it, I've done it, but I didn't know I was doing it.
You know, it was Super cool, dude.
I wish I had my own place.
Guys, mi casa es su casa.
- I even made you guys keys.
- What?
Check these out.
That one's yours.
Aw, it looks like a guitar.
Yeah, that's 'cause you're rocking.
Mine's a It's a rainbow kissing a star.
- You like it?
- Blah!
Yeah.
Guys, hang out here anytime you want.
- Even now.
Who's thirsty?
- Thanks.
Right there.
Dude!
- Shut up!
- Damn, man.
You're like James Bond.
But I'll be I'll be Moneypenny for sure.
- Yeah.
- Wait, which one is Moneypenny?
It's the woman.
Oh.
So, did the store have that, uh, bamboo highchair you were looking for?
No, not the one I wanted.
So I think I'm just gonna Order it online.
You still got it.
You still got it.
Big deal, I've been online, too.
I still got it.
It's different.
So, this is the problem.
Nick didn't tell his ex that we were together, and she found out, and now she's really, really upset.
This is the scariest one yet.
It's just a bunch of smiley faces.
Okay, um, not to be all guy with a baby, but, uh, exes are really a lot like newborns, okay?
The burps can be so yucky, but you know what comes after a burp?
What?
A big old smile.
Aw.
What the hell are you talking about?
It was a metaphor, Nick.
It was a classic fatherhood metaphor.
No, my-my point is you just need to face her and let her get it all off her chest.
Oh, I feel like I've done that.
No, you didn't.
You just talked and talked about nothing for 30 minutes.
Okay, look, I know it's hard.
I know that, man.
I'm here and I'm hearing it.
I mean, when Jess and I did this, I think we cried for, like two days?
I mean, at least.
But look.
Now I have such a good friend, and we talk all the time, and he's such a good listener.
Say what?
I can't hear you.
Is this real?
You guys saw each other naked, and now you're friends?
Yes, it's the purest form of friendship.
Straight Leno and Eubanks.
I just want to say you're incredible, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Okay, I took your advice.
What do we got?
"My bad.
Let's be friends, 'kay"?
Smooth, but tough.
That's not good, Nick.
Friendship is a, um it's like a beautiful flower.
You have to nourish it, okay?
- You can't just buy it at a store.
- All right.
First of all, it was a draft, okay, and I'll fix it.
And second of all, with all due respect, you can buy a flower at a store.
Millered!
I know as an angel you usually sleep in heaven, but would you care to spend the evening at my place?
I think maybe I would.
Fantastic choice.
Here's my address.
There's usually no place to park.
Well, so where would I?
You're a big girl.
You'll figure it out.
Uh, just tr-try south of Sixth.
There's usually a string of open spaces down there.
And there's not a right turn on red on Fifth, just FYI.
Okay, here's the deal.
I've been wanting to end things with Claire for years now.
And I'm gonna do it.
It's gonna take one phone call.
- What?
- She's gonna burn all my clothes on the lawn.
I don't care.
I only want to wear Henleys anyways.
Jess, we can finally be together.
What?
!
Wait, no, but leave your wife?
!
For you.
I'm gonna leave my wife for you.
Wait, what?
"Thank you for being so incredible".
"So lucky to have you in my life"?
- Jess.
- Mm-mm.
- When you said those words, I knew.
- No.
Berkley, there's been a fundamental misunderstanding here.
You know the last time Claire thanked me for anything?
It was when I was pulling out her chair at our wedding.
- No - She doesn't appreciate me like you do.
No, it's not happening.
No, no Aah!
Damn it, Winston!
Oh, God.
Pretend this is attached, and there's water coming out.
Okay.
No, not like that.
It's not sexual!
No!
I'm not feeding you water!
- Wet my mouth.
- No!
Oh, hi.
- Are you Schmidt's friend?
- What?
Sch-Schmidt's friend?
Where you at?
'Cause I'm ready to ea Hey!
My good friend Frank Scabopolis!
Ah, give me a hug, you Greek son of a bitch!
- Come here!
- What?
Where is this coming from?
You.
The phone calls, the texts, "Boyfriend problems," "I need you," hugs, kisses.
- What?
- More hugs, more kisses.
- I - You have been setting up dominoes for ten years.
And now they are falling.
You have a baby, sir!
I know.
And you are gonna make such a good stepmom.
I love you, Jessica.
God, it feels good to say that out loud and not just to my sleeping wife.
Guys, I need your help.
You, hey!
Nick was right about you, and he can't know that, - so put a sock in it!
- What is wrong with me?
- Hi.
- Hey.
I keep trying to write to Caroline, but I'm choking.
I can't get past "What's up, C"?
Oh, that's her.
It says, "Come to the window, friend".
Friend.
- That's good.
That's good.
- That's a good thing.
Yeah.
Caroline!
Hey!
You cheat on me and then you want to be friends?
!
I'm just writing you an e-mail!
It's-it's not sending!
Look, gonna throw it down, but I need my phone back!
- We talk now!
- Caroline!
Hey!
Stop!
Really excited to - No!
- talk to you guys.
Hey, stop!
That's not my car!
Tell Jess I said hi.
No, Caroline, I parked down the street!
It Why am I telling you?
!
At least she can't get into the building.
Okay, what am I gonna do here?
She cut off the power.
No, Nick, that was you.
You turned off the light.
All the other lights are still on.
My bad.
Thank you.
I know you're scared.
Let me be brave.
You should go because you have a wife, and you have a baby, and you love them.
Jess, what are you, crazy?
It's not safe out there.
Berkley can't go.
He stays here.
- I don't think that - Thank you, Nick.
You're very welcome.
I'll be with you in just one second, all right?
- Mm-hmm.
- And don't drink the water by the bed.
It's got my contacts in it.
Okay.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- And t-tell her that I'd like to be reimbursed for those strawberries.
- What?
Dude.
- Why is she calling you Schmidt?
I told her my name was Schmidt in case we saw your mail.
I don't just leave mail out.
This isn't a small business.
Get out.
Dude, I'm about to seal the deal.
I'm not getting out.
I'm about to I'm-I'm a deal sealer.
I'm about to get some squish, dude, and you need to not get in between that.
I'm about to nail it into the wall.
Dude, I'm about to take down that va-dragon.
I'm about to pin the tail on the va-donkey, dude.
You better not stand in the way of this.
Don't call her a va-donkey.
I don't even know her well and I want her to leave, but please don't call her - a va-d va-donkey.
- I won't.
All right.
Please.
I need this.
Okay, fine.
I will use the guest room.
- Yes.
- Like an animal.
Oh, yes.
Oh!
Winston!
What are you doing?
!
Oh, we were just playing a game.
You know, Bad Cop, Black Cop?
It's me, Bertie!
Um, I might have been wrong about some things, um, some Berkley things.
Hey, the screaming stopped.
I knew she'd run out of gas.
- "My bad"?
!
- What?
"Let's be friends, 'kay"?
!
You couldn't even write out "okay"?
!
It's go time, Nick.
Time to break out that burp cloth.
Jess, let's give him some space by going to a motel.
I don't love you.
I got a slight beer buzz.
Let's do it.
Yeah, don't go.
I thought you wanted me to talk to her.
Don't go right now.
I'm sorry.
You don't love me?
Say it again?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh What?
!
Then why have you led me on for ten years?
Oh, hell on Earth no!
Oh, my God, I was right.
- He wants to bone you.
- Oh, come on, Nick!
Caroline, I'll be right there.
I'm so sorry, Berkley.
You got cut off.
- Thank you, sir.
- No.
May, 2004.
You brushed my hand at Dave Matthews concert - during "Two Step".
- "Two Step"?
- Oh, my God.
- Or that time that I helped you move, and I came over, I was wearing sweatpants.
You couldn't stop staring at my rig.
She loves looking at rigs.
Why are you calling it a rig?
!
You're doing it again.
One second, Caroline!
Open this door!
You think I wear this sweater because I like it?
It's a handsome sweater.
- That's right, I love you.
- No!
What do you mean, no?
Ooh!
Open the door!
Come on!
Schmidt?
You said to me that I was incredible and you were so lucky, and now here we are, we're trying to hook up Nick with his ex-girlfriend.
I mean, that's what this is, right?
No, it isn't.
That's not what So let's just do it, come on.
- Hey, hey, - Berkley, Berkley!
- Oh, no!
- No, no!
- No, what are you doing?
- Oh, no.
- 'Kay!
- Oh, hey!
- Car-o-line.
- Yeah You stole my boyfriend.
Schmidt?
Be right there!
That should buy us some time.
Coach, you stay with your girl who thinks that you're me in my bedroom.
Winston, you stay in the guest room with Bertie doing whatever the hell it is you guys are doing.
- Gross.
- I'm gonna keep Sarah Almost there!
I'm gonna keep Sarah in the living room, using one of the living-dining-open-floor-plan bang spots.
Now, no exits, no entrances, no Noises Off baloney.
Capeesh?
Confirm my capeesh!
Capeesh!
- Let's go.
Do it.
- All right.
- Guys, guys!
- Right.
This is the exact type of baloney that I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.
Guys, guys!
I'm really glad that we're doing this.
- Okay.
- All right.
I did not steal your boyfriend.
Timeline.
Now.
Okay, um you and Nick break up.
London has a great Olympics.
Uh-oh, trouble in Syria.
Board up your windows.
Superstorm Sandy.
Hey, over here.
Me and Nick get together.
And here's that beautiful Sunday in the park that you and I went to, and we have a wonderful Sunday.
- Shut up, Berkley!
- No, you shut up, Jess.
Don't take this out on Jess.
Oh, oh, right, it's the beginning, so you're being all supportive now.
He's still trying.
I mean, I bet he's still laughing at all your jokes, right?
Well I have a great instinct for comedy.
All right, well, you know what, you enjoy all that while it lasts, because I'll tell you what.
It's not gonna be long before he stops holding your hand and starts high-fiving you and he stops letting you be the little spoon and he starts drifting off during important conversations.
Are you listening right now?
What's that?
- Seriously, Nick?
- Jess, you're the girlfriend now, but one day you're gonna be the ex.
And two years after he breaks up with you, he still won't tell you why.
Um, okay, well, um this has been a really, um, neat talk, so, um I'm gonna go sit in the shower, and, um, go over the greatest hits in my mind.
I'll just be right here, picturing the whole sudsy thing.
Hey, hey, ho, I'm right here.
How about a little respect?
I know.
What, you This is obviously happening.
No, it's not!
Where's your brain?
Hey, Jess, you okay?
No.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
I've led a very fortunate life.
Look, Jess, you were right.
No, you were right.
I feel like such a fool.
You were right about everything.
No, I wasn't.
Caroline deserves to know why I left.
And you should hear, too.
- I'm thirsty!
Stop!
Let me go, boy!
- No, no, no, come, come Whoa!
Who the hell are you?
Who the hell are you?
Schmidt.
What?
Frank Scabopolis is up in here making out with some bitch.
That's not necessary.
I mean Who's Frank Scabopolis?
Aren't you Schmidt?
!
I-I am Schmidt.
- I thought you were Schmidt.
- I am Schmidt.
Uh Uh, w-we're brothers.
We are, we're-we're brothers.
What an upbringing that was.
Yeah, same mom, different dads.
One browner.
Then who the hell is Frank Scabopolis?
Yeah.
I am Frank Scabopolis!
Is this helping, Schmidt?
I forgot the plan.
- Winston, please shut up.
- Plan?
What plan?
!
I there's no plan.
I know nothing about a plan.
Is this some little nasty group sex games y'all got going on up in here?
Been a couple years, but I'm down.
I didn't want to know that.
I am out of here.
- I'm way ahead of you.
- No, no, please!
Sarah, please, wait!
I can ugh.
Just Well, I'm gonna go back to bed.
Schmidt, that mattress is heaven.
It's pretty good.
See?
You don't think I'm scary, do you, baby?
- Oh, whoa!
- Oh!
No.
Hey, no.
- I was just kidding.
- No.
Hey, Caroline, there's something I need to say.
Nick, you don't have to do this.
No, I-I do.
Look, I never cheated on you, but I might as well have.
See, I fell in love with Jess the moment she walked through the door.
- Boo!
- Really?
Sorry.
The moment I walked through the door?
Really?
'Cause I thought I annoyed you.
Can we do this later, please?
- It's just not a good - Yeah, okay.
Got it, yup.
Got it.
Caroline, she's the reason that I left.
I always thought that it was Jess.
I'm glad I'm not crazy.
Well Hmm.
Thanks for telling me the truth.
Oh, I'm just sorry it didn't happen sooner.
- Don't touch me.
- I'm so sorry.
I was kidding.
There's that famous Milwaukee humor.
I'm not from Milwaukee.
You honestly scare me.
Good-bye, Nick.
Bye.
Hey.
Look, Berkley, um, I'm so sorry that you got the wrong idea about us.
You were right.
I did play some part in it.
Thank you.
- Good luck, Jessica.
- Thanks.
See you later, bud.
I really don't want to go back to my wife.
Do you guys want to play cards or something - Go.
Just go.
- Get out of here.
The moment I walked through that door, huh?
Just be cool about it.
'Cause for me, it was way later.
- Yeah, I know.
- Like, a lot later Oh, come here already.
You could use that for something.
- That's the "Glass Menagerie".
- Yeah.
I'll sit her down right on top of that.
Oh, absolutely.
The, uh, "Star 68".
Where's that at?
- Right there on that pillow.
- Oh.
- Wow.
- The "Jumanji".
Yeah, you do the the "U Lock" on here.
That'd be cool.
The "Jean-Michel Basquiat".
Oh, okay.
The "Fabric Softener".
That's the "Kansas City Shaker".
- This, right here?
I like that.
- Yeah.
Back there, that's the "Nia Vardalos".
- Ooh.
That's nice, dude.
- Nice.
That one's "Sex on the Rug," which is and, again, it's pretty obvious.
But that's you know, why mess with a classic?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, guys.
Bertie's playing it cool, but you guys coming over for dinner tonight is a really big deal to her, so Be there by 6, and no bailing.
Ooh, bailing on dinner.
Nick, I need you.
Wingman sitch.
Jewish girl, sensible nose.
High-level target.
I can't be your wingman.
We got to go this Bertie dinner.
Don't make it seem like a chore, okay?
She is making ten or eleven soups.
And all of them are cream-based.
Cool.
Hey, Mom.
Hi, baby, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I know the morning is the most sensual time of day.
But, um, I need you.
It's your sister.
Abby?
What is it?
She was arrested at a hotel in San Diego.
How's everything with your sister?
I mean, she was caught stealing, they called the cops, it's a mess.
Imagine me next door with a, with a nice Jewish girl.
- Hey, Jess has a sister?
- Yeah, I've never met her.
I need you to go to the jail, pick her up and put her on a plane home.
- Oh, that's fabulous.
- And by the way, um I don't know what kind of jail this is.
So be prepared for anything.
I mean, wear a shirt you don't love-love.
- Okay.
- Love you.
Hi Nick Okay, here, these are all the ladles that I could find.
Ooh, this one is deep.
Well, what's up with your sister?
Well, she's coming to town.
- Great!
- Ooh, yikes, that's The best news ever?
I know!
It's so, so, so, so, so, so, so good.
Well, I can't wait to meet the mysterious Abby Day.
Not mysterious.
Jet setter.
You know, I always imagined her with a French-speaking black husband, like a Jerome St. Pierre.
So, I'll probably meet her at the airport for a little layover hang.
- Why are you ignoring me, Nick?
- 'Cause I'm paying - Nick!
- attention to my girlfriend.
There, a reaction!
Thank goodness!
Now I know I'm not a ghost.
- All right, I got to go.
- Oh, you're going?
I'll, uh, I-I got to go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jess, Jess!
What if I came with?
Yeah, you know, I don't think - you two would really get along.
- Why not?
Look, I just haven't seen her in a really long time, and Jess, I'd like to meet your sister.
Why don't we do this?
Um Why don't I go pick her up?
And then come meet us for a quick dinner before she leaves?
- That would be awesome.
That's all I was looking for.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Winston, we can't make your dinner!
- Bye, Winston.
- I'm not gonna be with you.
- Wait!
No, no, no, no!
Wait Hey, hey.
Are you really letting Nick meet Abby?
Hell no.
I'm going to pick her up from jail.
Like, straight-up jail.
I told Nick he could meet her on her "layover" but, whoops, her flight got changed.
No time.
Sorry.
- Bye, Nick!
I'll see you later!
- I'm out of shampoo!
Gonna use bar soap!
But your sister won't know the difference!
Okay!
Can't wait for you to meet her!
He's never going to meet her.
Hey, dude.
I can't go to this dinner.
It's a double date now.
Things are already weird enough between me and Cece.
Because you went on a date two months ago and she never texted you?
Yeah.
- Be a man, Coach!
- All right.
Be there by 6:00 and bring a bottle of wine.
And don't be cheap, either.
Bertie is a Somalian.
Okay.
Oh, tidings, Abigail.
I'm Jess's beau.
My name is Nicholas.
- It's a pleasure to - Oh, good God.
- Is that a common barber's comb?
- Look, Schmidt, I just want to make a good impression on Jess's sister.
Yeah, well, I want Julia Child not to be dead, but here we find ourselves.
What did you come here to talk to me about?
As I was saying earlier, I have a very difficult flirting situation here.
I mean, it's a double black diamond: trees, moguls.
And, as we both know, you're the best wingman who's ever wung.
Thank you, Schmidt!
I'm almost glad I got in the accident so we can have more days like this together, with you helping me through this.
How could a guy so rich be so generous with his time?
Whoa Excuse me.
Are you the writer of So You've Mastered the Female Orgasm, Now What?
- Incredible.
Can I have your autograph?
- Of course.
Come on, man.
It's a quick party.
- I'll have you back by your little dinner.
- Okay, I'll do it, but as soon as Jess says I've got to go, I'm out.
Thank you very much.
For your mitigated support and tiny portion of your life.
- Sure.
- Okay.
Hey, Abby.
Oh, look who came to pick up her big, bad sister.
So, you good to go?
Or you gotta sign yearbooks or something?
Bridget stole your gum.
What?
You took my Fruity Fruit?
I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch!
- Oh, my God.
Oh - Gum?
I want my Fruity Fruit!
I ain't got your Fruity Fruit, bitch!
What about the new guy?
I want to meet him.
We don't really have time to meet him 'cause I have to take you to the airport 'cause Mom's already bought you a ticket.
I know all of her credit card information, - No.
- and I can just change it.
- Wait, what are you doing?
Wait, no.
- Sweet.
Why don't you just for once in your life do something that you're not supposed to do?
I didn't put the cap back on the honey bear the other day.
- Drive.
Drive.
Drive.
- Oh, my God.
No!
No!
- No!
No!
I will not drive unsafely!
- Try-try it!
I have a perfect record.
Get your hands away from me.
- Why don't you want me to meet him?
- About.
- Are you embarrassed of me?
- I do.
No.
- Great.
'Cause I just got on a later flight.
- That's great.
- So excited.
- I know.
Did you just start driving really slow?
No, I actually think I'm speeding.
I hope there's no coppers around.
Drive faster.
Sorry, sir!
Thank you for your service!
- What is this place?
- It's a bar mitzvah.
I am not watching a kid get circumcised.
The target is Rachael.
She's a Hebrew school teacher.
Crashing some random kid's bar mitzvah's the best way to get her?
Get her on the dance floor, a little bit softer now, a little bit louder now, sweep her off her feet, we'll get married, we'll have a son named Elon.
At his bar mitzvah, I tell the story of how I met his mom at this bar mitzvah.
Not a dry eye in the house.
Jewish continuity, et cetera, et cetera.
Do you realize how long you were just talking?
There she is.
Whew!
- A beautiful piece of hamentaschen.
- What the hell is hamentaschen?
Problem is her dad is my rabbi.
He hates me.
So I just need to charm Rachael before he gets to her and tells her horrible-slash-true things - about me.
- Absolutely.
Oh!
Hello!
- What a day.
- Oh a special day.
Oh, take my hand.
- Take your hand.
- A special day.
You just wanted to take my hand so you could say that again, didn't you?
Mmm, I did.
I don't think we've had the pleasure of meeting.
May I take your hand, too?
You can take anything you want, Shirley.
So, yeah, just the just the two of us with Bertie and Winston tonight?
Yeah, just, uh just-just you and me.
Uh, and Bertie.
And Winston.
- Just eating night lunch.
- Yeah, like a you know, like a date.
But not a date 'cause - Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, uh - What is that?
Is that a onesie?
- Yeah.
How do you how do you take it off to use the bathroom?
Mmm Whoa.
Nice place.
- Oh, my God!
- Hey!
- You look, you know, amazing.
- You look amazing.
Look at you.
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy you're not just paper-thin anymore.
Oh, my God.
You're just the best.
Hello, Hot Cocoa.
Whoa.
- What's going on here?
I'm getting a real vibe.
- Nothing.
- No.
- Mmm, you want to have sex with her, you are not so sure.
If she doesn't want to put out, I will.
- Abby Day - There you go.
Abby Day, she always says The most inappropriate stuff.
You a cappella sing at me one more time, I'll rip that stupid little dress off you and shove it down your mouth.
Okay, I'm scared of you.
Let's go in my room Don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.
Damn it.
She hasn't called.
Will you put please that away?
We're 30 seconds to curtain here.
I don't want to miss a call from Jess, man.
I need you focused.
Are you ready?
Yes.
I distract the rabbi while you hit on his daughter.
And action.
Go.
Ugh.
What a spread, huh?
- Terrible.
- I agree.
Thank God I have pizza in my car.
Yeah, that's very funny.
What's the matter with you?
That wasn't a joke.
Who has pizza in their car?
Listen, when I make a joke, you'll know it.
I'm a joke machine.
What are the chances?
I love jokes!
Oh, good, okay.
Uh Oh, did you hear the one about the waiter?
- No.
- Walks up to a table full of Jewish women and says, "Ladies, is anything all right"?
Hi.
Rack-hael!
Baruch ata Ado, nice dress.
Oh, thank you!
- Uh, Shabbat sha-hello.
- Yeah.
- It wasn't as good as mine, but it was cute.
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Thanks.
- How's Hebrew school?
- It's fine.
It's the only place that would hire me after I got out of rehab.
- Two Jews walk into a bar.
They buy it.
- 'Cause they're rich people.
Yeah, they well, these particular Jews happen - to be rich, but they worked hard.
- I'm sorry.
Hold on - Telephone call in the middle of a punch line?
- Hey.
- Generation's the worst!
- Hey, what's going on?
So Abby's flight is crazy delayed.
Um, so, no time for dinner.
I can come right now, Jess.
No.
Um, she has, um, a conference call with Hong Kong about a very important, uh fashion business, uh, venture magazine conference.
Well, maybe I'll see her next time.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
You will not speak to my daughter!
Rachael, this man is a nut ball!
A nut ball?
How dare you!
I'm a goof ball.
Sammy Davis, Jr. was a goof ball.
You, sir, are no Sammy Davis, Jr. - I'm a I'm a goof ball.
I am a goofball.

Bad news.
Daddy, I love sex, and he wants to have sex with me.
Let him!

What was that, man?
Jess is embarrassed of me.
Can you believe that?
- What a shanda.
- What's a shanda?
A shanda!
What a shanda!
All you care about is Jess.
Remember when we used to be best friends?
Uh, that was neat.
What a neat time in my life that was.
Hey, Schmidt!
My girlfriend's embarrassed of me.
Can we go on that for a little bit?
Or does the wingman never get to, you know, flap his wings?
The bird never gets to be the main bird.
This.
Ugh!
So, I just talked to Nick, and this is a real shame in the pants, but he's not coming home tonight.
- What?
Why?
- He had to hang out with his work friends.
- He can't come and see me?
- Guess it's just us till the airport.
Mmm.
You see what you're doing, right?
Oh, my God.
Mom.
No!
I'm turning into Mom.
How did this happen?
- "Just a little bit".
- "Just a tipple".
- "I don't want to get stoned".
- Hey, I love that she calls "getting drunk" "getting stoned".
Oh, my God.
Wait.
Big news.
Mom got one of those very, very small denim backpacks.
- What?
- She did, and she calls it her blue guy.
She's, like, "Oh, I got to grab my blue guy".
Can't believe you're making fun of Mom.
You're her perfect little baby.
I'm Hey, I'm I'm not really a baby.
You're a super grownup.
Thank you.
- Oh, my - What?
I have a picture of Mom wearing the backpack at her sign language class graduation.
- Oh.
- You have to see this.
- No.
- It's amazing.
I have it in a photo album.
Ooh, bonus shot of Dad getting a haircut while eating spaghetti!
Abby?
Hey, Outside D, have you seen a girl that looks like me, but with chaos in her eyes?
Sorry.
I'm doing my taxes.
Ooh!
I'm taking in more than I'm spending.
Hey.
Hey.
How's it going with Abby?
Yeah, you know, we were having fun for once, and then What happened?
Tell me what happened.
I will take care of it for you, baby.
Baby?
I got this.
I got this myself.
Thanks.
Quick question.
Is pee-pee a write-off?
Hey.
Not sure my body's built for these chairs.
It's a regular chair, man.
Yeah.
Hey, bub.
How you doing?
Well, I want to apologize.
Sorry I got distracted.
It's okay.
I'm sorry your girlfriend hates you.
Ah, she doesn't hate me.
She's just ashamed of me or something.
Well, you know what?
If she's really ashamed of you, then then she's the stupidest bitch in the whole wide world.
- Easy.
Okay, slow down.
- I apologize if I went overboard.
- Water under the bridge.
- I've never been ashamed.
Wish I could have helped you get that girl, man.
Feel like I blew it.
Well, she was kind of nutty.
What happened to us, man?
We used to be the best in the biz.
We still are.
I'm the best wingman that's ever wung.
- Make a plan?
- Absolutely.
You're my brother.
Thank you.
Charge that to room 304.
Ah!
You!
Charge that to nothing.
She's checking out.
Adding this hotel to your rap sheets?
You found me.
- Oh, yeah.
- Don't you want to know why I left?
You saw my text, and I'm I'm honestly sorry, but you do ruin everything!
Whoa.
Thought I was gonna turn the tables with that one.
Get your ass in the car.
I'm taking you to the airport.
Thought we could share some calamari.
- Now!
- Kobe beef sliders?
- Now!
- Lobster quesadilla?
Right now.
This is a great Mmm.
You know, Bertie had a dream she killed me.
So, uh, Coach, what's new?
Nothing.
Isn't that right, Cece?
Hmm?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, you'll figure it out.
If not, just text me.
Or don't.
You're good at that.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
We made out once, pointlessly, for two hours.
That's it.
Get over it.
Let it go.
Pointless was it?
- Yeah.
- I mean, who does that?
!
Super-hot make out, and then, you ice me out for two months.
What are you talking about?
!
Ice out what?
You text me, "Happy Monday".
What do I do with that?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe have a happy Monday.
Going out with you was the hottest and dumbest mistake I ever made!
It was the hottest, dumbest, - sexiest mistake I ever made.
- It was so dumb of me to pick you up and press you up against that wall.
So dumb how cool those bricks made my skin feel.
You guys should try the fisherman's bisque.
Has just the right amount of tang.
- That tang?
- Mm.
That's tang.
Okay.
- Whoa!
Whoa.
Okay.
- Sorry.
I was trying I was trying to Just gonna pivot a little bit more - to the side.
Yeah.
- Yeah, just pivot?
No, okay, look, I think the way it was was more I was up, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you were up.
- That's-that's how it was yeah, up.
- Just Okay.
- All right.
Now what do we do?
Maybe just, like, lower your center of gravity, and then this is gonna work.
Just lower it down, I'm gonna clench my thighs.
- I'm gonna fall.
I'm gonna fall - I'm clenching my thighs as hard as I can.
- Okay, okay.
- What?
Oh.
Geez.
- Oh!
- Geez.
That was awful.
- That was the worst.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Wow, what is happening?
- Oh, Lord.
Maybe you were right not to text me back, 'cause that was embarrassing.
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's cool.
Can we just be friends now?
You know?
Yeah.
I mean, why not?
Friends?
Friends.
Friends.
Come here, you.
- Oh, oh!
- Aah!
Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Literally just bit my tooth.
- I'm sorry, when I get excited my teeth come out.
- Who does that?
- Sorry.
- I think I broke my tooth.
Let me see?
Oh.
Okay.
Go straight to the gate.
Look I get why you're mad at me.
Okay?
But if it's any consolation, I'm a woman in my 30s about to get on a plane to go live with my mother.
It's only a matter of time before I have a tiny denim backpack, too.
I said I would never go back to Portland.
So I guess I'm a complete failure.
I'm the baby.
Is this the craziest thing that's going on in the airport?
Really?
Okay, recap, you hit the dance floor, and Do what I do best, be an embarrassment.
Well, it's a gift, Nick.
I need you to ruin this bar mitzvah.
What do you say, just get out there and do some weird dancing?
- It's got to be bigger than that, man.
- Bigger than that?
Then I come out there and I knock you out.
It's all right.
Again, it'll be a stage punch.
Don't worry.
I've done several productions of West Side Story.
I know.
You told me.
As a Puerto Rican Shark.
Da, da.
- That's cool.
- It was awesome.
You never came and saw it, but - Well, I was very busy at that time.
- Whatever, never mind.
The rabbi will then come out, he'll thank me, - the hero - Gotcha.
He'll offer me his daughter's hand, then, five years from now, Rachael is pregnant with Elon's little sister and we're having a beautiful family New Year's then in our vacation condo - in the Florida Keys.
- You're doing it again, you're talking in speeches.
You've been monologuing, lately, Schmidt.
Do you s Do you, do you hear yourself?
- I-I'm unaware of it.
- You Okay.
I'm not gonna get mad at you, 'cause I respect you and you're one of - I'm unaware of it.
- But, like, it's weird.
- I apologize.
I'll stop doing it.

Light this cannon up so I can shoot off.
Oh!
Well, well, well, it's a snake in the grass.

- A doctor.
- No, I got that.
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.
I like your glass What happened to your eye?
I got beat up at a bar mitzvah.
And I know that's embarrassing, and I know you're too embarrassed of me to introduce me to your sister.
- What?
- And I get that, Jess.
- Nick, that's not at all what - You know what?
There is something I just cannot shake, I been tossing and turning all night long.
We literally have been apart for like I am your wingman now, Nick, because it-it takes two wings - Don't do this.

She's a total train wreck, and she was in jail.
Well, look, why lie?
You know how many Millers have been or are currently in jail?
I get it.

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Man, this is gonna be fun!
- Ah, come on!
Get it close to the light.
Okay, just because you invented Sky Knife doesn't mean you can tell me how to throw.
Hurry up, man.
You can do this.
One, two, three.
Sky Knife!
Yeah!
What's up?
Oh, hey.
What's up?
Nothing, just a Hey, uh, straight-up chillin'.

You were in the drop zone.

- You were a hero!
Good save.
We were playing Sky Knife.
You mad?
No.
No.
I I think it's been a great game this week.
I'm amazed at how great it is.
Uh!
Awesome!
I thought you were gonna be mad.
All right.
I'm gonna go get the bad-ass knives from Schmidt's house.
- Cool.
- Get 'em, girl.
Um, guys, we have a problem.
I know, but Abby's gonna fix it.
She's going to get the cooler knives.
The problem is Abby.
She's been here one week and has already created chaos everywhere.
I don't know if anybody noticed, but she destroyed my sunflower painting - with a picture of a penis.
- The iguana's cool.
- I like the iguana.
- Who doesn't love an iguana?
- I like its tail.
- Yeah.
Oh, my God, you guys, it's Terry.
The bastard found me.
He wants his stuff.
Who's Terry?
!
What's his stuff?
!
Cocaine drugs?
!
Worse.
You guys got to hide.
Oh, my God, I knew this was gonna happen.
- Everybody in your earthquake spots now!
- Jess!
She's messing with you.
Yeah, I know.
We are messing with you.
- No.
- I don't think you were involved.
- Don't taunt you, dude.
- You guys were all afraid of Terry.
Us Day sisters up to our old pranks.
- You're not part of it.
- Yes, I am!
- You got messed with.
- You got messed with, not me.
You're doing that voice when you get messed with.
- No, I'm not.
- You guys, this is so fun.
- I want to live here.
- Ah, ha, ha!
That was funny, 'cause we're messing with you again.
No.
I'm serious.
That one was real.
I think I should live here.
I hate this game.
You looking up how to eat a bagel?
No.
I'm, uh, seeing if I passed the LAPD entrance exam.
Results go up in 30 seconds.
If you pass, you get to be a cop?
No, I get to go to the police academy, you know?
Hope I get a dog partner.
Yeah.
Oh, you are pretty calm for someone who's about to get life-changing news.
You must be really cool under pressure.
No!
I'm a huge choker.
Huge!
Girl, I ain't had a job in over three months.
So, this is that moment, I guess, when you find out if you're really a failure or not.
Check it.
Excitement's killing me!
Man, would you look at the time?
Man.
Girl, I got an obligation at a sandwich meeting to to go to.
Yes Well, you see, loyalty has a price, Mr. President.
Give me the hot dogs!
Put the damn hot dogs in the bag, you son of a bitch, and I won't Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?
She can't move in to Take that off.
- I hope those are clean.
- Enough.
I don't want to be involved with your weird thing with your sister.
It's not a weird thing with my sister.
She is crazy.
- No.
- She's wanted in Canada.
Canada.
No one's wanted in Canada.
Hey, uh, you guys want to hang out, like, right now?
Maybe go up to Alhambra, try on a whole mess of jeans?
Don't you find out about that cop test today?
Oh, you know Oh, yeah.
No.
Look, man, the Alhambra thing, though it's getting a lot of momentum, you know?
So I think I'm gonna go ahead and do that 'cause when you you know, when you do that, so Okay, I'm gonna guarantee you that Abby is responsible for that.
Yeah, she got to me.
If you don't want Abby to live here, Jessica, why don't you just tell her?
Nick, you can't just tell Abby to do something, 'cause she'll do the opposite.
So I'm gonna have to go find a place for her to live and make her think it's her idea.
She can't find out what I'm up to.
Do you think you can keep her busy and lie to her all day?
Jess, I come from a family of con artists and liars.
And the one thing I learned is, you can't lie to a liar.
It don't fly.
Yeah, you shouldn't be involved.
No, I shouldn't.
Wait a second.
Are you doing reverse psychology?
Yeah, it is reverse psychology.
That is reverse psychology, so you just reversed it, so now it's reverse, reverse, which is just psychology.
Hmm, which one is it?
You outfoxed me.
I'm in.
I'm gonna do it.
So, our time is up, but, um, I don't have any more clients, so, uh Oh.
You brought it with that less set, ma.
I got to tell you.
I mean, what can't that butt do?
- You shaped it, so you get dibs.
- Mmm.
Dibs.
Can I get dibs?
Because both y'all butts look great.
I mean, I can't tell who's in first place.
Hey, uh, Coach, you know how you're always getting on me about my pizza baby?
- Yeah.
- Well, today is the day that I get rid of it.
- I am here to train.
- Save it, dude.
You're avoiding your test results.
Nick texted me.
Guess you can't outrun a text.
- Nope.
- Well, with the right amount of training All right, listen to me.
Um, I need you to leave.
I'm with a client.
A beautiful one.
I'm trying to, you know Mm.
You're trying to whistle.
No, no, no, no, no, I'm trying to have sex with her.
Oh!
Sex.
But I did book you for the entire afternoon, though.
- Why would you do that?
- But if you guys are doing a little thing, then I could easily just - Leave and check your test scores?
- do a tandem session.
- Oh, fun.
- Right?
Coach, you should show him that ground stretch you did on me earlier.
It was opening me up really nicely.
Yes, please.
I don't wanna.
Oh.
This is amazing.
Oh!
I'm taking a little trip here, Coach.
You know where I'm going.
Why do I keep looking down?
I don't know.
This museum is my favorite place in Los Angeles.
Um come on, Nick.
Jess is making you babysit me, right?
Babysit you?
What?
Like you're a little baby?
No.
- That's how you want to play this?
- Well, I'm not "playing" it.
- Oh.
- Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing?
- I just want to touch it.
- Don't touch it.
- I just need to touch it.
- But it's not for touching.
Hey, hey!
What?
Can I not jump on it?
- Abby.
- That's not allowed?
- Abby!
- Maybe I shouldn't climb all over the car.
You need to get off of that car.
Why don't you tell me what it is Jess is up to?
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, you're scratching the hood!
Tell me what I want to know.
- Get off there right now.
- There's nothing to tell!
- Tell me what I want to know.
- There's nothing to tell!
- Tell me what she's doing!
- Get her off!
- If I tell you, will you get off the car?
- Yes.
- You promise?
- Yes.
She's looking for a safe apartment for you 'cause she doesn't want you to live with us!
Now, would you please get off the car?
Do you guys serve drinks here?
Why don't they give us Tasers?
Wow.
I mean, this place is beautiful.
It makes the other nine places we've seen today just kind of fade away.
Yeah, um, tell me about the neighborhood.
Is there a lot of nightlife?
Well, this part of town is pretty quiet.
Unless you count church bells.
Which you should.
We have nine within hearing distance.
What about the other tenants?
Are there single men between 18 and 65?
Actually, make that 16 and 72.
Most of the other tenants are middle-aged gay veterans like myself.
Oh.
Whoa.
Jackpot.
And if the demons come calling, there's an emergency room right across the street.
You had me at "gay veterans".
And then again at "emergency room".
And before that at "church".
I wish I could just travel back in time and tell 19-year-old me to move into a place like this.
Maybe I would've settled down.
Met a, you know, nice guy.
Nothing flashy.
Works in a bank, makes a great veggie lasagna.
- Okay, not now, Cece.
- No, don't stop her.
Who is this guy?
Right?
Bet you are a mean dancer.
Come on.
Live a little.
You were right to call me.
Nobody deals with crazy girls better than I do.
Crazy girls are kind of my Hurt Locker.
- You know what I mean, Nick?
- Okay.
Yeah.
Some-some men, they can just walk away.
Not me.
- I just keep coming back.
- Okay, are you gonna help me - get her off the car?
- Mmm.
- You know what this is, Nick?
- What?
- This is nonsense.
- Exactly.
And how do we deal with nonsense?
No, no.
We just don't stand for it is what we do.
Security is on the way.
Come on, you old bird.
Get up here.
I can't afford it.
I'm already the staff troublemaker.
- Can you make it happen?
- I'm thinking.
Where are you at right Like, is it kind of game Yeah.
Just shh.
- I got it.
- You do?
Yeah.
No nonsense.
Hey, Abby, look at me.
Let's go get a taco.
Okay.
- You got to be kidding.
- There you go.
Thank you.
There you go.
Perfect.
Hey, you're not gonna tell Jess I told you about the apartment, right?
Hmm, I don't know.
Maybe.
We'll see.
It'd be cool if you 'Cause Why don't you straighten things up with the museum?
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
It's only ten dollars!
That's not gonna It's ten dollars!
You snakes.
Follow through.
Yeah, all right.
Or else that creepy guy at the bar isn't gonna take his hand off your thigh.
Hands off my thigh, dude!
Hands off my thigh, dude.
What are you doing, dude?
Stop stalling.
Check your score.
I'm not stalling.
I'm gonna have Anders work my core and maybe just go get some juice with him.
- No, um.
No, I-I want juice.
I'm - Hey, I bought your time.
I do whatever I want with it.
Go check your score!
Hey, what are you doing?
- No.
Wait, what are you doing, dude?
!
- I'm checking it myself!
No!
Come on, man!
I said no, dude.
No.
W What?
You failed.
I didn't even You know, it's not even a Yeah, it's not a big deal, so You know, so You should probably put a passcode on your phone, dude.
Hey, Schmidt!
Hey, Schmidt.
Have you seen Abby?
Huh?
What are you what are you doing?
I'm melting chocolate.
Abby and I are having sex.
What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt?
I've really changed my tune on nonsense, Nick.
You know, for the life of me, I could not understand the grasp that Jess had on you, but if she came from the same gene pool as this one kudos, my friend.
Even if it's a tenth of what I just experienced.
Even if it'sa DeVito/Schwarzenegger split from Twins.
You calling Jess the DeVito?
- What?
- Abby, I was supposed to be watching you.
- Go ahead.
- Don't don't play tricks with my words.
Jess is gonna kill me.
She's gonna say my name in that short, clipped way - where she doesn't add the "K".
- What?
When she's mad, she just says "Nic".
Do you really think that the "K" adds to the sound of your name?
- Yes.
- How do you usually say your name?
- Nick.
- Say it without the "K".
- Nic.
- It's the same thing.
Stop distracting me!
Nick, you're so worried about disappointing Jess.
Relax, man.
Okay, you got to get out of here.
Oh I choked.
I choked, man.
I'm 31.
I have nothing figured out.
Can I not find a job?
- I mean, I feel like I'm losing it.
- Dude, they're hiring here.
You know I can't work here, man.
They never have any cookies.
It's all the better, man!
There's no pressure.
You get this job and then when you're ready, you try the cop thing again.
Okay.
- See?
- Yeah.
But now I'm sitting here thinking about how badly I need this job.
- Stop!
- I need this job real bad Excuse me, um, could we get a job application over here, please?
In a way, I have a lot more riding on this job than I do the cop thing.
God, I'd love to work here!
I got the apartment!
The place is great.
The only thing I'm a little worried about is there is a Russian grocery store down the block and Abby has a little bit of a weird thing with ethnic white people.
But I think she could really thrive there!
Where is she?
- Where's who?
- Abby.
Ab?
Oh, she's sleeping.
By herself.
Which is called "napping".
Okay, I'm gonna start secretly packing up some of her stuff.
Do you think you can keep distracting her?
- Yes, yeah, you know, just - Good.
how do we distract her?
How do you distract a woman like that?
Probably a guy.
Right?
Who can we set her up with?
Well, well, well, who do we have?
Coach.
No.
Winston That's actually kind of a good idea No!
- Schmidt!
- That's a terrible idea.
But in the same sense Abby will wreck Schmidt!
- Well, then luckily, the - So, here's the plan.
We're gonna have a nice dinner, we're gonna get her buzzed but not drunk.
And then we're gonna casually and naturally bring up the apartment so she thinks it's her idea.
- And I can do that, okay?
- Okay, good.
- I'm glad.
- I'll act cool, natural.
Casual.
Au naturel.
Au casual.
You know what?
Maybe I should write you some lines, pal.
Yeah, I'd really appreciate that 'cause Maybe not a lot of words.
Uh, so tell me, what are your three weakest qualities?
See Just say "perfectionist".
- Perfectionist.
- Yeah.
And the other two um I'm overheating, right?
I'm overheating, okay?
So here's what we're gonna do now I'm just gonna shoot from the hip, little rapid fire, give you some fun facts you might not know about me.
I hate standing up, I'm bad with numbers, and I just honestly, from the bottom of my heart, don't think women should be allowed to handle money.
Just, that's for real.
Let's just move on to the salary.
And you didn't even fill out the back of the application.
There's a back?
There is a back to the application?
- Coach.
- What?
The LAPD exam maybe it had a back.
You didn't check to see if it had a back?
We got to go to the precinct.
I didn't choke.
I'm just careless.
And that is my biggest weakness, you bitch.
- I'm so sorry, dude.
I'm so sorry, dude.
- Yeah, that was bad.
- Man, I didn't even mean that.
- All right, get out of here.
- Get out of here.
- Dawg, I didn't mean that at all, man.
To our newest resident.
The City of Angels has sprouted another pair of wings.
It's a majestic city, drenched in sunshine, that is actually just a collection of 75 different neighborhoods.
Wow, I had no idea.
Please continue to tell me more.
- You want more?
- Who wants to rediscover couscous?
Hey, what the hell are you doing here, Schmidt?
I invited him.
- I live here, too, right?
- Yeah, but It's okay, Abby can make her own decisions, no matter what they might lead to.
- Thank you.
- Now, somebody call the pound 'cause my stomach is growling.
I said my stomach is growling.
Sp okay, uh, speaking of dinner, there are a lot of great options in North Hollywood.
It's a real hot spot full of young, hip people who will be the leaders of tomorrow.
- More wine?
- Great.
If I were moving to L.A. now, I'd say yes-ho to NoHo.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
Oh, my.
Stop touching him, Abby.
I'm sorry, what'd you say?
- Touch him more?
- Do not touch him.
What are you?
Do not do this right now.
How about that?
As luck would have it, I actually know of a place in North Hollywood with great tile work.
I said, "Great tile work".
Oh, for the first 12 months.
I think what you really mean to say is there's an introductory offer - for cable television.
- That's it, yeah Cable's a scam, I tell ya.
Sa Satellite.
What happened to no nonsense, Schmidt?
Satellite's where it's at.
Nonsense has the hands of an angel.
Okay, what's going on here?
I told Abby about the apartment, and now she's giving Schmidt a sp a special.
Don't look at me.
Just look away.
Look away, look or look right at me.
- So this was going on the whole time?
- Yes.
And the hands are just the half of it.
I mean, there's been banging and poking and scratching and hanging and teasing such teasing.
I mean, really excruciating, life-giving teasing.
Shut up, Schmidt!
She was talking to me.
This has been a whole day of lying and I can't take it.
First I had to lie to Abby, and so I spilled the beans - about the apartment.
- I'm sorry.
And then I had to lie about Abby and Schmidt and the boning.
And then the manipulating and the out-manipulating That's lying!
If you guys were just honest with each other for one second, none of this would have happened.
Okay.
All right.
Abby I'm really sorry I tried to trick you, but I just want what's best for you.
- One of us has to!
- You know, that is your problem.
You think you're better than people and you always try to fix them.
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you do.
You've done it your whole life.
It's annoying.
You know what?
Yes.
Yes.
I would like to fix you.
No I would love to fix you!
But I'm done trying.
Because you're not changing.
And you don't think or care about other people at all, and I do.
And that's why I don't want you living in this loft.
That's honest.
You're a garbage person and you should live in a Dumpster with rotten snails.
Hey!
Nick!
- Too far!
- Yeah, way over the line, buddy.
Yeah, but I thought we were just piling in That's my sister, dude.
I didn't mean that, yeah.
- Sorry.
- Well, lucky for you, I'm moving out.
Oh, thank God, Abby.
Oh, my God.
You're really gonna like this place.
- It's so nice - I'm moving in with Schmidt.
What what's that, now?
You're moving in with who?
- Seriously?
- We would have sex all the time.
Dinner was lovely, you guys.
- Thank you so much.
- Bye.
- What?
- Ooh.
Hey, uh, Jess?
Can I borrow your glasses?
We're gonna role-play as you guys.
Ew.
No.
You don't understand.
She's not gonna be you.
I'm gonna be you.
Ugh!
Get out, Schmidt!
Get out of here!
Okay Oh, God!
What's up, my man?
I took the test last week or should I say, I took the front part of the test last week and, sir, I am here to finish what I started.
What?
What he's trying to say is, he took the entrance exam, but he forgot to do the back half.
Well, the test is administered on a computer.
There is no back.
You took the test on a computer?
I choked.
I am a failure.
I am a loser.
I am never gonna amount to anything.
I'm never gonna shoot somebody.
Dude.
Have some dignity, all right?
Thank you for your time, sir.
Winston.
Winston!
Yo!
Winston!
Dude, you failed, man.
You failed hard!
At everything!
- Dude, this pep talk sucks.
- I'm not finished.
Like, seriously, it's like the Winston of pep talks.
Look at me.
You can do this, Winston.
Because now there's nothing to be afraid of.
You hit rock bottom, man.
This is the worst it's gonna get.
Sir, it has been my dream to become a cop.
And no one's gonna stand in my way not you, not him Hey, I was helping.
and definitely not myself.
I would like to retake this test.
Well, there's one at 7:30 tomorrow.
Man, what about my last score makes you think I'm ready to take this test again in 12 hours?
He'll be there.
- Yeah, I'll be there.
- Yeah.
Thank you for messing everything up and being such a terrible liar.
Uh, you are very welcome.
I think I really needed to say that stuff to my sister.
- She's gonna wreck Schmidt.
- Oof He has no idea.
I'm sorry my family's so crazy.
Crazy?
Your family's not crazy.
My family's crazy.
My father used to trade horse semen.
I've got an uncle whose God-given name is Shifty.
Well, thank goodness we're the sane ones.
So - Okay, now, remember: Up, and - Uh-huh.
Hello, Abby.
Hey.
S'up?
Have you thought about what you're gonna do if they pair you with a dirty cop?
Well, then, I would just go to Internal Affairs.
Well, that's a good way to get killed.
Then at least I would die a hero.
Hmm, no, you won't.
They'll put you in panties and then they'll plant you next to a dead prostitute.
That's a poor lady.
It'd be a dude.
But it's awesome!
Good luck on the exam!
They got dude prostitutes?
Nuh-uh.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Thank you so much for having us over for brunch, guys.
It's the least that we could do to celebrate the one-week anniversary of your sister moving in with me and becoming my live-in lover.
Was a little fast.
Babe, you have syrup on your face.
Oh, you can get it.
Mmm.
Babe, you have some powdered sugar Back off!
I'm starving!
Come on.
Just let me get it off.
It's so much.
Get your own French toast, Jess!
I got these slices, so they're for me to eat.
If you want the slices, get your own slices.
Um, that's your fourth plate, Winston.
I'm trying to bulk up for the LAPD fitness exam.
I am going to ace this obstacle course.
Schmidt, you got something crazy around your neck.
Abby made this.
Look.
Ow.
Look at that.
- Not a fan.
- I forgot how much I love making jewelry.
Schmidt's been lending me money for supplies.
- Yeah.
- Schmidt, are you bleeding?
Oh, look at that.
I most certainly am.
Wow.
What makes Abby's jewelry so interesting is that it's actually dangerous and can cut you.
Abby's gonna open up her own store one day.
Mark my words.
- She shouldn't do that.
- Nope.
I'm gonna open up a store in your mouth.
But now that you're living here, I can have my old room back.
Jess, I'm gonna need you gone by 5:00.
- Done.
I need a break from Snore-a Ephron over here.
- Okay.
Oh, Schmidt and I don't need any space.
We have no boundaries.
But I guess not everybody can have what Schmidt and I have.
You guys will probably get there.
Don't worry.
Remember how long it took you to get boobs?
Yeah, but I started shaving my legs at nine.
So joke's on you.
Mmm.
Wait.
We have so much sex.
Don't try to eat the other slice.
I'm gonna get to it.
Can you believe Abby and Schmidt?
Yeah, tell me about it.
Making love at their own brunch?
No class.
They're a fake couple.
They're not real.
We're a real couple.
If anyone should be moving in together, it's us.
Well, you know, we already live in the same apartment.
Right.
So why not take the extra step?
We basically sleep in each other's rooms every night, so what is the difference?
It's a really big difference.
Because right now we're roommates but we're not living together.
Not "living together".
- You know?
- No.
Living together is a step.
It's official.
It's an official step in a relationship.
So the word "official" is the key.
Abby and Schmidt did it after one week.
Come on.
We have so much left to learn about each other, stuff you can only learn if you're crammed together in a small space and you can't get out.
Just you and me.
Four walls.
No boundaries, no escape.
When you put it like that, it sounds amazing.
- And like prison.
- Well, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room.
It's so close.
Just pop over there.
Mm.
- Do you not want to?
- Whoa.
I did not - That did not - So you're saying you do want to?
Oh, my God, Nick, we're moving in together!
- Officially?
We just agreed on it?
- Yes!
Yes!
I cannot think of a reason why not to.
Reason 13: I like my stuff and I hate her stuff.
Reason number 14: How am I ever gonna change my clothes?
You don't change in front of your girlfriend?
You get naked in front of her.
Yes, but those are different things.
When you're naked, you're powerful and it's glorious.
When you're changing, you're hunched over and cowering, like an animal.
Animals don't wear clothes, Nick.
All I'm saying is I need my space.
True intimacy.
Embrace that.
Abby and I, we have one sponge.
And we use it for everything.
I don't like that, but you seem happy.
Don't hold back, Nick.
Expose your cracks and love will fill them.
- That's nice.
- Thank you.
Do you know how hard it's been for me to take this conversation seriously while you're wearing - that thing around your neck?
- It's an Iroquois throat band.
- That's the ugliest thing I've ever seen.
- Yeah, you're jealous.
- No, I'm not.
- It's not just a choker, it's story.
What's the story?
She didn't have enough supplies?
- I'm not through the whole thing yet.
- I got to tell you, man, looking at that thing, the sex must be awesome.
Cece and I have been hanging out a lot more lately.
She sort of treats me like I'm one of her girl friends, and You don't like it?
I love it.
I mean, usually, when I'm friends with a girl, I'm either trying to get that butt or she's trying to get this butt.
But with Cece, it's not about the butt.
It's not about the butt, man.
It's cool.
- It's like We're like sisters.
- What?
Coach.
Hey, do you have, uh, Schmidt's keys?
Kind of got a weird favor to ask.
It's only weird if you don't ask, girl.
- What?
- That's what I'm talking about.
You know I'm doing this for you, right?
- Somewhere - This is great.
What are we doing?
We are snooping on Abby.
- Oh, love it.
- I do not trust that girl.
She's always working an angle.
Now she's got Schmidt all wrapped up, giving her money for "jewelry".
Treachery!
First, they came for my silverware and I said nothing.
- What's up, dawg?
- What are you guys doing here?
Schmidt, I know that Abby is fun and she is charming, but I'm telling you, she's bad news.
Is that why you guys are sorting through my garbage?
I appreciate the concern, you guys, but Abby has changed.
Then how do you explain this?
I put my coffee grounds in a plastic bag so it doesn't get the rest of my trash dirty.
- Really?
- Yeah, he does that.
You got clean-ass trash, man.
I don't even need gloves for this.
Quit sorting through my trash, Coach.
You're messing it all up.
Schmidt, you've known this girl for a couple weeks, okay?
I've known her for 20 years, and, I am telling you, she's not to be trusted.
Your words are changing his opinions about things.
Up top.
Mm.
You two as friends is a real bummer.
I'm not into it.
Our first night living together.
I'm just excited.
Expose your cracks and love will fill them.
I'm changing.
Great.
I'm reading.
Okay.
Yeah, I'm just gonna take my pants off.
Okay.
You know, I've seen you naked before, right?
What's going on there?
Oh!
Never changed in front of a woman.
- You know, mostly you just hook up and - Really?
Are you serious?
All right, I'm gonna read.
Okay.
Here we go.
Yeah, it's Just gonna put this on here.
What is that?
Oh, this is my long shirt.
Yeah.
Oh.
That's why you're laughing.
I had it on the wrong way.
That must have been funny-looking the way it was.
I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.
- And so yeah.
- Why does your bottom need to breathe?
Well, it's like a plant.
Needs sun and air to survive.
Never mind.
Um I like it.
- Um yeah.
- Great.
I like it.
Okay.
- This is great.
- This is great.
I'm excited.
Me, too.
- What are you doing to the pillow?
- I'm trying to get comfortable.
Oh, okay.
Got it.
Got it.
I can't I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Turn off the light.
- Great.
Mm.
Ow!
What?
So-Sorry.
Sorry.
- What the hell is that nightmare?
- I just have to Sorry.
- Just reading.
- Yeah.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna sleep with my head over there.
Okay.
Yeah, that's That's gonna be better for me.
You know what, I'm gonna get some water.
- Oh, hey.
- My room looks totally different.
Turned it into a workout space.
I am so glad it opened up.
Oh, why didn't we do this sooner?
Crab walk.
You don't know where a crab's gonna go.
And you know what?
Where does the crab go?
Oh!
Oh, aah!
Owie.
Hi.
Just enjoying the peace and quiet.
Whoa, hold up.
Hey, Jess, what are you doing?
Oh, I just, you know, sometimes I work in the elevator now.
You know, helping some of the older residents.
Hmm?
This is your floor, ma'am.
So, how are things going with you and Schmidt living together?
I have never felt so clean while being so dirty.
- Awesome.
- Last night, Schmidt wanted to take me to a hotel, but we could not even get out of the loft without ripping each other's clothes off.
Oh, that's our thing, too.
We have the hotel until tomorrow night and it's all paid up.
You guys might as well use it.
Take it off our hands.
Lobby, please.
Wait, I forgot Bernie.
Hold the elevator.
Bernie, Bernie, where are you, you idiot?
I'll just be here, waiting.
So, Nick, the police academy training is going well, but I'm a little worried about the rings, because of the you know the incident.
Shut up, you guys, I can do this.
No, Miller, no, Miller, no!
I'm sor I got big laughs.
You got to give the people what they want.
Everybody saw my ding-a-ling, Nick.
My ding-a-ling.
I've got an issue that's more important than this.
Ever since Jess moved in, I haven't had a second to myself.
You see what she's done to my writer's desk?
It's like an arts and crafts area now, man.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
I'm staying at a hotel tonight.
Not alone.
With other people.
I have to chaperone a field trip to Sacramento, so You know what, you seem too busy to talk about it.
Go, go.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.
Wait, weren't you just saying how you Whoa, dude!
- Good one, Nick.
Bye.
- Bye, yeah.
That, uh, I'm, uh, I'm sorry.
I can't believe I let you guys talk me into tailing my own girlfriend.
Look at this neighborhood, Schmidt, she is up to no good.
I feel very uncomfortable being here, I trust Abby, I don't want to spy on her any more, okay?
We're not spying.
We're just carefully watching.
Girlfriend is going down.
- Yeah, she is.
- Let us bust her, buster.
That was a good one.
That was.
Yeah.
Okay.
This dynamic between the two of you It's very annoying to me.
- I'm sure I'm not alone on this.
- Hi, hater.
- Bye, hater.
- Okay, enough is enough.
I'm getting out of here.
- Hey, it's my car - Guys, guys.
I don't care whose car it is, I'm going.
- I don't care who - It's my car.
- Oh.
- Aah!
Great.
Hit a parked car in the same neighborhood they shot friggin' Children of Men.
Yeah!
I'm alone!
Yeah.
I'm alone and I love it.
Coffee for one, a sundae for one, and the most tasteful, story-driven adult film.
Preferably a period piece.
The farther in the past, the better.
You know what I'm talking about, girl.
Do you have anything in the Byzantine Era?
No?
All right, just a shot in the dark.
It's so little.
It's so little.
- I'm trying to sleep!
- Okay!
- Which ding is ours?
- Which ding is ours?
Coach, there are knife holes in the door.
What does it matter?
Let's get out of here.
At least write "sorry" and put it under the windshield wiper There are none.
Uh Maybe put it under the dead bird's leg?
- Hobo!
- Aah, there's a dude!
Ho-ho-hobo, for real!
- Hobo!
- Son of a bitch Hobo.
Thank you, Jingles.
You got it, girl.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
Tailing me?
- No.
Um - Yes, we're tailing you.
I know how you work: You glom onto guys and then you just bleed them dry.
Well, you are not gonna do it to Schmidt.
What's in the box?
Tell us what's in the box.
Zippers.
What?
Z Zippers, you guys.
Guy up there'll give you a great deal.
He also loves crack.
Can we go now?
Thank you, Abby, let's go.
My car is gone.
Well, that's not surprising.
Oh, you can do this.
You can do this, Winnie.
What are you doing here?
On a school day?
I see this means you're the cutting type.
Which means you're the pantsing type.
Well, I got news for you, buddy.
You ain't getting 'em!
Not today.
How 'bout I take your pants, huh?
Not like that, everybody!
I'm not trying to take the little kid's pants.
He's trying to take my pants.
You see how he's eyeing my pants?
So I eyed his pants You know what?
You win.
You win, you little son of a bitch.
You win!
I don't want to tell you how to police your beach, but right now there are truants outside of this hotel, stirring up trouble.
Hey, yo, lookin' good, Charlie!
Debbie, see you at 1:00 on the massage table.
Winston.
Mm.
We are gonna sneak into Schmidt's and see what's really inside those boxes.
- Cece, darling - Hmm?
- What?
- How long have we been friends?
A week or so?
- And have I ever steered you wrong?
- Well, no Exactly.
Because I know you better than anyone, girl.
And you're acting like a lunatic.
I mean, the kind of lunatic other lunatics look at and go, "Oh, my God, that bitch a lunatic".
So I'm gonna need you to figure out why you're really doing all this for Schmidt and then sort it out.
You did not just say that to me.
Think about it, girl.
Shoot Just to be clear, I did not ask you to act like this, okay?
- It's just kind of fun to do - Slow down, girl.
You gonna eat that scone?
- Damn it.
- Slow down.
Are you-are you gonna have this scone?
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
Just looking at my Garbage Pail Kids.
Jess makes me put 'em in a box.
How are you gonna put art like this in a box?
What's going on with you?
Nothing You will not tell Nick that you saw me here because then he'll get upset and I'm gonna have to move into my old room, and that means that we suck as a couple and that Abby was right and I cannot let that happen.
Jess went to a hotel because sharing a room with you is driving her crazy.
Dude, at really was a tough one to keep in, but, honestly, I held my own and I did - my best.
- Are you kidding me?
!
I can't believe it!
I changed in front of her!
Sharing a room is driving you crazy, too.
But I didn't lie about it.
I never get to win these things.
So, anyway, I just want to apologize.
It was wrong of me to get involved.
Are you sure you don't want to tap Abby's phone?
Run a DNA sample?
I don't want to be coarse, but the bedroom is covered in it.
I was worried about you, okay?
I didn't want her to take advantage of you 'cause I know that you will do anything for the people that you care about.
Well, I guess I could say the same thing about you.
And, you know what, maybe Abby has changed.
I'm thinking about helping Abby lease a storefront - for her jewelry.
- Is that crazy?
It's It's amazing.
Don't hold back.
Here.
Here, I want you to have this.
- Oh.
- Abby made it.
Oh Mm It's a cough drop and - these are hard candies.
- I see that.
I truly hate it.
You're welcome.
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.
How was Sacramento?
It was great.
The kids cried when they saw the capital.
Oh, did they?
How many students showed up?
- What hotel did you stay at?
- Old Sacramento Inn.
- What room did you stay in?
- 523.
- What floor was that on?
- Five.
- Was there an elevator to the 4th floor?
- 5th floor.
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Smoking.
- You don't smoke.
- In Sacramento, I do.
- What'd you have for breakfast?
- Continental.
How are you this good at lying?
!
I know you're making this all up!
I know you didn't go to Sacramento.
I know you went to a hotel to be by yourself.
- Damn it, Winston!
- Nick loved being alone, too!
- Damn it, Winston!
- That's for my ding-a-ling!
You didn't like living together either?
No, but it was your idea, and it seemed like the thing to do.
But at least I didn't lie about it, Jess.
Okay, I did!
But you were driving me crazy.
You wear a nightgown.
Are you talking about my long shirt?
You look like the Little Match Girl, wandering around Victorian England selling matches for a penny.
- I look like George Washington.
- I was just trying to be a good couple.
Schmidt and Abby are doing it.
Well, Schmidt and Abby are crazy.
They're doing a lot of things.
Why can't we do this?
I don't know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh-oh.
Last time I saw you day-drinking was when you got kicked out of jazz ensemble.
I'm still pissed off about that.
What does that mean, "too enthusiastic"?
How come you're not at the hotel?
Did you and Nick break the bed?
Because, legally, they cannot make you pay for that.
No.
I was by myself.
Oh, I've broken the bed by myself.
Big-time.
No, I went to the hotel to get away from Nick.
And I wore a robe and I watched a documentary about Ethel Kennedy and it was one of the best nights of my life.
- So you win.
- Your relationship's better than mine.
And I can't even share a room with Nick.
I don't win.
Come on.
I swing from guy to guy.
I don't think I have ever paid my own rent.
You travel the world, collecting lovers.
All my lovers could fit in one SUV.
And, yes, maybe somebody would have to sit on someone's lap, but they would fit.
And you're just brave.
You and Nick are brave.
You guys know each other, you get under each other's skin.
He has the feet of a hippy cult leader.
But that's the difference.
I just throw myself into whatever comes along because I really don't want to be alone.
Why not?
Being alone's great.
You should try it sometime.
Seriously.
It might help you figure yourself out.
You're Abby Freaking Day.
You can do whatever you want.
Except vote.
But, seriously, you should've seen Nick's feet.
The bottoms are all black, except for one patch of yellow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just packing up your things and then I thought about what you would want and how you probably didn't want to move again, so I decided to do the right thing and just take your room.
- My room's bigger.
- Is it?
I never - Nice try.
- All right.
I got to move some stuff back then.
Hey.
I'm sorry that this didn't work out.
- I'm sorry that we sucked.
- Look, we don't suck.
I'm crazy about you, but I don't have to spend every second with you in what amounts to a one-room log cabin.
Cabins are what drove the Pilgrims crazy.
That's why they killed each other at the Plymouth Rock Massacre.
- That's not a real thing.
- So how did the millions of Pilgrims die?
There definitely weren't millions of Pilgrims.
Then how do you explain my 37-page essay about it?
- I think you made it up in your head.
- This seems like one of those - "agree to disagree" moments - No.
It's not.
- I'm also older than you.
- Anyway, I love you and someday we'll make this work.
I think so, too.
Just-just not now.
- Not like this.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
But if you're not doing anything, want to come over?
I am over.
- Oh!
- Hey, guys.
Uh, just a little hot goss from apartment 4C.
Abby's gone.
- What?
- She's gonna stay with your mom for a little bit.
Something about saving up to be independent?
Wow.
Good for her.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
You know in hindsight, maybe we moved a little bit too fast.
I just wish that I had realized that - before I rented her a storefront.
- You rented her a storefront?
It was a three-year lease in an undesirable neighborhood.
It totally obliterated my bank account, so I've decided to sublet my place, and I'll be moving back here, under duress.
Y-You're moving back in here?
Well, it shouldn't be a problem, right?
I mean, Coach is in my room, and you guys are now moving in together.
I'll just move into Jess' room.
Cool?
- Yeah, but, like - Asking was just kind of a formality.
'Cause my name's on the lease, so You guys are the best.
Oh - Yay!
- Yay.
- Cool.
- Great.
- Let's do this.
- We can make it work.
You have to start washing your feet.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
You taking up tennis?
No, it's an electric fly swatter.
- I want to see it work.
- Well, we need a fly.
I've been waiting whole morning.
Did you honestly just kill one?
Hey, what's going on, guys?
Ooh!
Ah!
Walk with dignity, you giant toddler.
Come on, Schmidt, you got to get this stuff out of here, man.
Yeah, well, I can't afford storage.
All my money's tied up in the storefront I leased for Jess' sister.
So why don't you put your junk in the storefront, Schmidt?
You really want me to put an Ian Schrager rug in a room without climate control?
What?
Oh, he was the guy in Star Wars.
Medium talent.
- Hey, guys.
Morning.
- Hey, Jess.
Hey.
Come on, Coach!
Let's hustle!
I got Coach a job at the school, and it's his first day.
I don't like kids, I don't like teaching, I just like paychecks.
Well, I think you're gonna love it.
I don't think I'm gonna love it.
Run!
Do not stop running or I will eat your faces and bodies!
Keep running or I will murder your family!
I love this job.
You're pissing me off!
This one.
This one.
I got my eye on you.
Thanks for helping me move my stuff, you guys.
Lots of hairy boxes God, I've fallen.
Almost below you now, Nick.
Fellow passengers, stuck in the caboose of life.
You think I'm in the caboose of life?
You love it in the caboose, not me.
It hurts.
It's actually quite jarring.
Loves it in the caboose - I don't love it in the caboose.
- Yes, he does.
Uh, hi.
Are you guys open?
Oh, this actually It's not a store.
Oh.
That's too bad.
- I really like that lamp.
- You like You like the lamp?
I'm sorry.
You know what, it just It's just that It doesn't It doesn't feel like a store yet - is what I meant to say.
- Piano player is a nice touch.
Aw, thank you very much.
He's lovely, isn't he?
Pl-please look around.
Feel free.
The lamp is 100% full price.
Uh, pretty much everything's What you're doing is illegal.
You can't say this is a store.
I'm not taking advice from you.
You pronounce the "G" in "lasagna".
Lasag-na.
Oh, my God.
I think my arm's broken.
I'm gonna sue the crap out of you.
Winston!
Quiet.
So, I have Jamal Chambers in my fourth period, and he cannot stop talking about how fun and enthusiastic his new volleyball coach was.
You were right.
I love this job.
I knew it.
I knew you'd love it.
- Hey.
- I was looking for you.
You weren't in my car.
Internet's down.
Okay, um, well, I rebooted the router.
You're actually on the wrong IP address, so There you go.
Ooh.
You know I can see everything that you search for, right?
I'm a biology teacher.
It's all research.
Fixing computers and stuff now?
I'm just taking on a little extra responsibility around here, just getting stuff done that needs doing.
Graffiti's wrong, kids.
Don't do it.
I love corn on the cob, too, but I'm not gonna paint it all over the walls.
I'm just hoping, you know, in a few years I'll have enough experience that Dr. Foster will consider me for vice principal.
Why don't you just ask him for it?
You can't just ask for a promotion.
You know.
You have to earn the promotion with years of good work.
What's funny?
Uh, how's that working out for you, Jess?
Do you see this volleyball?
It won't get over the net just because you want it to and you hope someone will notice that you want it to.
- Okay.
- I'm gonna ask you one more time: What do you want?
Um, I want to be vice principal.
All right.
Then spike that ball, Jess.
Oh, that's not Okay, um - You got to spike!
You got to spike!
- Is that really Yeah.
Okay.
- No, wait.
I'm not very good - Spike it!
I've just never really been good with athlete balls.
- Spike it!
What do you want?
!
- I want to be vice principal.
Spike the ball and tell me what you want!
I want to be the vice principal!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Oh!
Oh Oh!
Oh I will not laugh.
An outrage!
Been all over and I can't afford anybody.
Unbelievable.
Access to premium legal counsel should be every Jew's birthright.
And the jury will see that there is no justice for the Hebrew man.
Not in these so-called United States.
What is that that you're doing?
I can't get enough of this legal drama.
Check this out.
Favorite author, Grisham.
Favorite TV show, Judging Amy.
Favorite color, courtroom brown.
Courtroom Brown.
Damn, I wish that was my nickname.
Did you just think of that?
'Cause it was perfect, man.
- Courtroom Brown.
- Dude, you're a born Courtroom Brown.
That's me.
When you say "Courtroom Brown," I respond.
Hey, Winston.
- Hey, Courtroom Brown.
- Yes?
Kill 'em, Courtroom!
That's awesome!
What am I supposed to do in this situation, represent myself like some nut job?
Nick could be your lawyer.
This Nick?
Vivica A. Dropout?
First of all, I don't want to be involved, but thank you, Courtroom Brown.
And second of all, I passed the bar, which means I can practice in the state of California.
Oh, Nick, you would be the worst in the whole entire world.
No offense.
I love you, dawg.
I could be your lawyer easy.
You don't forget how to be a lawyer.
It's like riding a bike.
They've changed these!
Fine.
I forgot how to ride a bike.
But I'm not gonna forget how to be a lawyer.
I guess I have no choice.
You can be my lawyer, Nick.
- I won't do it.
- What?
I value myself too great for that.
If you want me to be your lawyer, if you want to win this case, you must start with the word "please".
And I'll need a symbolic five-dollar retainer.
Four dollars.
Skin it.
Let's do it.
Hooah.
Dr. Foster, I am young, I'm energetic and I think it's about time you take advantage of me!
Well, this is a little awkward.
I'm, uh I'm exclusively into Asian women.
It's really a Kristi Yamaguchi thing.
- After Lillehammer - I really meant professionally.
I want you to take advantage of me like that.
- Sorry.
- It's a professional thing.
- Okay.
Sorry.
- I want to be vice principal.
Frank retired, you need someone.
I deserve it.
I bust my ass for this school.
You've got it.
The job is yours.
- It is?
- Oh, my God, are you kidding?
I thought I was gonna have to force somebody into it.
This is so much easier.
- Really?
- Go ahead.
Be vice principal.
- I can't believe this.
- In fact, I think you should start right now.
You will not be sorry, sir.
Did you?
- I got the job!
Yeah!
- Oh!
- I spiked the ball.
- Time to celebrate.
No!
No!
I'm not doing that!
- No!
- We got to celebrate!
Celebrate!
Let me pour it on your face and your clothes and your hair!
Yeah.
Uh looks standard.
Yeah.
You're definitely being sued.
Uh, your deposition is tomorrow.
What-what do we do now?
Do we prep for the plaintiff?
I don't like prepping.
It makes me feel nervous.
I feel boxed in.
And I'm very quick - on my, uh - Sure.
Did you just forget the word "feet"?
Feet.
Yeah.
Nick, you should really prep.
Fair enough.
Winston, you're my plaintiff.
Done deal.
Okay.
Hi, my name is Tim Baker.
I live at 522 Dugan Court Terrace.
Okay, Mr. Baker, how long have you been a chef?
I don't have to answer that.
You actually do though, Winston.
Doesn't he?
You ask Why you asking me, man?
- No, I'm not.
I'm Yeah.
- You're the lawyer.
No, I know.
You have to answer.
How long you been a chef?
I already answered that during background.
What in the hell?
You did background without me?
Why wasn't I invited for background?
You have to answer it!
How long you been a chef?
!
You're fired!
Give me another chance.
No!
Okay, here's something.
Get on a plane with me.
While you think about it, put this on my card.
It's the black one.
Wow.
That just happened.
You think maybe we should take his card and buy him a new shirt?
I'm scared he'd want to change it in front of us.
I'm Cece.
Hi, Cece.
I'm Buster.
I really hope that's a nickname.
No, it's not a nickname.
It's your real name?
I was bullied pretty bad.
Hi, Buster.
All right, hold on.
- I've got quite an eye for young boys.
- Oh, God.
That's right, I said it.
It's not a typo.
Let's see some I.D. God, you're handsome.
I'm sorry.
Wyoming!
- Look at that.
- Mm-hmm.
Wyoming.
So you're one - of the three people from Wyoming.
- Yeah.
Cowboy state, big sky country, home of the Liberty Bell.
Bull snatch.
That's an awful accent.
What is your real accent?
Are you Australian or from Heaven?
How old are you, for real?
- Leave him alone.
- Don't bull-snatch a bull-snatcher.
Leave him alone.
You're over 21, right?
I'm not.
Um I'm 20.
Get out of here, you delicious bastard.
- Can I get my I.D. back?
- No, of course not, you can't.
It'd be against the law, you wonderful creature.
Nice to meet you, Cece.
Good God, you look nice.
Nothing irks me like underage drinking.
It's stupid, it's dangerous, it's irresponsible.
God, I want to have sex with that kid so bad, it's freaking me out!
Oh.
I'm real tingly.
We have talk about the budget.
There's a problem with the budget?
But it's due Monday.
- Yeah.
- Do we have too much money?
- No.
- We need to fire people.
- What?
- And when I say "we," I mean you.
Start with the most recent hires.
Well, we have, um Janet from the history department.
Human garbage.
Okay.
Ernie, uh Ah, yeah.
No.
That's Coach.
No.
No.
No.
No, he's very good at his job.
Last one in, first one out.
You know how this works.
- That's just wrong.
- This is the job, Ms. Day.
He's my friend.
I can't.
No.
I'm not doing it.
I'm not firing Coach.
This is the job, Ms. Day.
Do you want it or not?
I'm what?
We had to do budget cuts, and we have to let two people go, and you're my friend, and I couldn't stop it.
I'm so sorry.
We all pitched in.
Thanks, guys, I'm not coach anymore.
I'm just Coach.
- What?
- What?
Morning, Winston.
Are you not talking to me?
Look, I had to fire Coach for my job.
I didn't want to.
Don't squint at me.
Don't do that.
I did it for my job.
It wasn't my choice.
- Hey, Nick, what's up, man?
- What's up, Winnie?
- Hey, Nick.
- Hey.
- Can we talk for a second?
- Can I talk to you?
Schmidt fired me, and now I'll never get to use this briefcase I just bought, and it was $19!
- I think my thing is a little bit more - Do you think I'm sexier when I hold it or when it's down?
'Cause I think it's kind of sexier when I hold it, like this.
- Not really.
- Do I look like a man of power?
Imagine this: It's, like, a rainy day, I'm on the streets of New York, Hey!
Stop that cab!
I'm a businessman.
I'm late to an important meeting.
I honestly feel like I would've been so good at this.
You don't want to be a lawyer.
Why do you care whether - Schmidt fired you or not?
- I spent all those years at law school with those preppy dicks and I never got to prove them wrong, Jess.
Okay, go after what you want.
Just make sure that what you want doesn't make you a cog on the wheel - of a larger, flawed system.
- Stop it.
Shut your mouth.
'Cause what you're saying is beautiful.
I'm gonna go put on my power suit.
High and loud, girl.
Whoo!
Um Good talk, Nick.
With this thing, I feel so sexy, It's disgusting.
- I think you misunderstood - Whoo!
- Your representation running late?
- Uh, no.
Actually, I'll be representing myself today.
Sorry we're late.
- What?
- This building is a total mess.
Nick Miller of, uh, Cooper, Bishop and Furguson.
As you know, my boss and senior partner, Mr. Winston Furguson.
Gentlemen, pleased to be with you.
Please, please don't get up, don't get up.
I-I insist.
Madam Secretary.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm representing you.
- Everything all right?
- I'm a bit caught off guard.
I wasn't expecting these two very real lawyers to show up today.
Well, we wanted to let you know that the entire firm is standing behind you.
Besides, whether I sit in my office or in here it's all billable.
Am I right, gentlemen?
Shall we get into this, or just take our pants off?
Ask him a question.
- Let me Let me do my thing.
- Do your thing.
Mr. Baker.
Yes?
What's your home address?
Okay.
Uh, no no further questions.
What?
- Keep going.
- Ow!
Just keep going.
What are you Don't hit me.
What are you hitting me for?
- Is everything all right?
- Sure it is.
The meter's running.
Even though you don't work at Coolidge anymore, you'll still be Coach Coach to those kids.
It's Coach Coach.
Yeah, Coach Coach.
- Coach Coach.
- Coach Coa - Coach Coach.
- I'm sorry.
It's all good, Jess.
You did what you had to do.
I'm proud of you for that, okay?
- Yeah.
- I hope I'm the first of many you fire.
That really means a lot to me.
I am gonna miss those kids, though.
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm gonna miss.
Those little those little bastards.
Little Ronnie.
Ronnie's so clumsy and slow.
- Yeah.
- Thomas.
I mean, he's strong, but that boy is a classic middle child.
He's just looking for love, up, back and sideways.
And Maurice.
He always makes a mess whenever he eats a Popsicle.
It's, like, dude, stop sucking your Popsicle like that, man.
You're never gonna get a girlfriend like that.
And then there's Hunter.
God Fat cross-eyed clod-hopping Hunter.
Hunter is the sweetest little idiot there ever was.
He's so sweet!
He's so sweet!
Ahh Screw this!
Because you told me to go after what I wanted, and this is not what I wanted.
Let's go!
We're gonna get you to that game!
It's okay.
They're playing Pasadena.
They don't stand a chance.
Pasadena has a bunch of bitch-ass tricks.
Weren't raised right.
Hey, what do you want?
I don't know.
I want to be there.
So, spike that ball!
That was not a ball.
That was beer.
I know.
I feel really bad about it.
- You know what?
Don't feel bad!
- Let's go!
- Let's go!
- You got me all fired up!
I think you're gonna have to drive.
Mr. Miller: "Were you or were you not wearing oversized shoes in the store"?
Mr. Baker: "I was not.
I told you that".
Mr Miller: "But are you sure"?
Mr. Schmidt: "Shut up, Nick".
Mr. Miller: "Let me do this.
Ow.
Stop it".
Mr. Schmidt: "Stop what?
You're hitting yourself".
Mr. Miller: "You're a child".
Mr. Schmidt: "A child would be a better lawyer".
Mr. Furguson: "Children are our future".
Mr. Berklan: "So true".
Mr. Miller: "I need to regroup.
I'm gonna stall a little bit.
Watch this.
Could the lady typer read that back"?
All right, all right, we've had enough.
My client is graciously willing to settle for $20,000.
As an actual real attorney, I highly suggest you take the deal.
- Great.
We'll do - Not a chance.
There's not a chance.
Sidebar.
Come on, Schmidt.
- Hurry up.
- Just You are not taking that settlement.
Well, Nick, at least if it's $20,000, I can get out of that hole some day.
I've got a plan.
You just have to give me a chance.
Can you believe in me?
All right, I believe in you.
Deal.
- Deal.
- What's the plan?
Oh, I'm not telling you.
You're gonna get too mad.
Let's go.
Nick, I take it back!
I don't I don't believe in you!
Here.
How long is this game?
Go get 'em, Coach.
All right, listen up, you no-talent, idiot babies!
Give me that.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Oh, thank God.
Bring it in.
Come on.
All right, now, who is gonna win this match?
!
Coolidge!
Who's number one?
Coolidge!
Let me hear it!
Who are we?
- Coolidge!
- Rakim!
Really, Rakim?
Like I just walked you right up to it, and you're gonna We're gonna talk.
- Coolidge!
- Too late, man.
It's too late.
All right, guys, get out there and make me proud!
- Ms. Day?
- What?
What is going on?
I thought you fired Coach.
Look, Coach loves the kids, and the kids love him.
I want this job, but I'm not going to do it your way.
I'm not going to let our best people go.
You were the one who told me, we have no money.
Yeah, but we can make it up in other ways, we can be creative.
We can rent out the multipurpose room after school to local clubs.
And where will the orchestra practice?
Did you ever consider that, Ms. Day?
Or were you too busy buying a ladies bike?
- What?
- They can use the library.
No one goes in there anyway.
Yeah, let's burn the books!

I'm gonna sit down.
So, are you gonna sit, or?
No, I'm gonna stand.
'Cause isn't that what we are doing?

What is the plan?
Injustice!
I will not stand for it.
That is why I will sit right now.
I will sit down in this chair You're negligent!
Aah!
Get off me!
My neck!
My neck!
Seriously?
The fall-down on the chair bit?
- Is this your first case?
- Yes, it is.
And that is why I'll file petition on petition.
You're gonna wake up in the morning to paperwork.
You're gonna go to bed at night to paperwork.
So how about this, gentlemen?
You pay the $20,000 settlement to your client yourself, and you'll never see our faces again.
What do you call a lunatic who's only got one case and no hobbies?
Your worst nightmare.
Let's go, guys.
Listen, Bill, if you ever want to play with the big boys, you'll give me a ring, won't you?
This is a baseball card.
Yeah.
All right!

You did it.

Another round of shots.

You know that, right?
Okay.
Oh, I knew you'd come back for me.
So what do you want to do now?
You want to just drive?
Oh, no.
Mike!
- What?
- Ple I got it.
Thank you.
Hey, what you doing here?
- I just wanted to come and say - Mm-hmm.
First things first.
The legal drinking age in Australia is 18.
Second, you're really beautiful.
Like, you're really beautiful.
Like, I want to take you out some time.
But because I'm 20 and already at a bit of a disadvantage, I thought I'd come and do some uncharacteristic self-promotion to help the cause?
- Okay.
- And let you know that well, I just opened my own business.
I build boats.
Uh, wooden boats with my hands.
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, old ladies love me.
They call me sensitive.
And I'm a really good cook.
But I know three dishes, and two of those dishes are the same thing.
Yeah, that's about it, so, what do you think?
Do you want to get a drink?
Like a soft drink with you?
- Soft drink, a walk.
- Can you have a coffee?
- Yeah, I love coffee.
- Mm-hmm.
It's one of the three meals that I know how I make.
All right.
- Oh, do it!
- Well, done, sir!
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.
Or you know what?
We could actually we could probably just go now.
I'd like to comb your hair, you hunk.
I don't know who they are.
They just come in here, and they drink, and make a lot of noise and talk about things they don't know about!
Hey, Mike, I'm gonna take a break.
Um I don't know when I'll be back.
I'll just meet you out front.
Stop what you're doing.
There's a lawyer here to make Jessica?
Jessica, I won the case.
If you woke up right now, we could be making love.
Jessica?
Power couple.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}

What's the harm?
We can do this with dignity, self-restraint, and dare I say - honour.

Shh Turkey bacon.
- Mm.
- That's nice.
- That's ni, Nick.
- That's ni.
Get sleep.
Yeah.
Help me up.
I'm trying.
You're You drink some water.
Aw, son of a bitch, the water fell on the ground.
Here.
Here you go.
Drink the water.
That's good.
Oh, no.
- No.
- Oh, make it stop.
- Jessica, make it stop.
- No!
Oh.
Hello.
Jess, where are you?
It's Jacob's first birthday.
You're his godmother, I need you here.
Sir, hi.
Who are you?
This is a private residence.
I'll be right there.
Hey, Nick.
It's me, Jess.
I have really bad news.
We have to go to a one-year-old's birthday party.
I'm not interested in that birthday party.
Thank you for the invitation.
Good night.
I'm so hungover.
- Why today?
- What?
You think it went bad?
We're your new neighbors.
Um, I think y-your bagel fell out of your mouth.
I'm Jewish.
Why didn't you guys tell me I was still wearing ladies' sunglasses?
I look like Magic Johnson's son, EJ.
Hey, you guys, I got a problem.
You know that guy that I'm dating?
Buster, your child bride?
He's 20, okay?
Not that it matters.
- Is he smooth all over?
- Does he take baths in the sink?
I sent him a bunch of drunk texts last night.
- What?
- Mmm.
Oh, dear Lord.
- I know.
- "I miss the way that your hands smell"?
Did you write an entire Jewel song in here?
Is it from Pieces of You?
You want to buy a rabbit with him?
This isn't a text message, it's a freaking Russian novel.
Okay, well, you know what, what do I do?
Text him one of the little yellow men.
The-the emoticons.
You know, with the with the fa with the faces.
I hate all of you.
Okay, so we really tanked it with those babes.
Look, we need to orchestrate a situation which allows us to put our best foot forward.
- That's easy.
We help 'em move.
- Winston, Winston shh.
Why?
It makes perfect sense.
Helping a girl move makes you come off as a doormat, you know what I mean?
Honey, honey, honey, just listen to Coach.
Baby, look, let us handle this, okay?
You go help Cece with the text messages.
- You know, maybe I will.
- Okay.
But only because I really do enjoy helping people.
You're gonna be great, buddy.
You're gonna do good things, man.
You think we were too harsh on him?
He makes you.
He does.
Don't blame yourself.
How the hell did this happen?
I found some things and I put them on.
- Throw this on.
- Mm.
- Okay.
That'll do it.
- Cover up the tops.
You look great.
No.
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- No, you're you're getting emotional.
You do this when you're hungover, but I'm gonna need you to stay focused so we can get to that party.
- Yeah.
We just need the gift.
- Yeah.
I got the gift.
All right.
Why is it in the box?
It's supposed to be out of the box, assembled.
I said I would put it together before the party, and it's before the party.
So what's the problem?
Just give me five minutes.
Ten minutes, tops.
But I got this thing.
This is it.
Christmas morning.
Our little guy waiting by the fireplace, but there's no gift.
'Cause Daddy's in the other room putting it together.
Did you say "our" kid?
Yeah, sometimes I think about what our kid would be like.
Don't you?
Yeah.
You don't think about the future?
Can we not talk about this right now?
Six hours ago, I was lapping cognac out of Winston's hands.
Drink it up, Checkers.
Forget what you saw.
Never talk about anything serious when you're hungover, Jess.
I don't even really think about it that much.
I just think about, you know, passing things.
Just Nothing specific.
We live in a house by a lake.
- That sounds pretty specific.
- We live in a town with a sense of history but not so much history that the locals are suspicious of new people.
Two small children who are so incredibly creative they named themselves.
We don't need to discipline the kids 'cause they're so afraid of disappointing us.
Our house smells like cider.
And if there's a horse out back, you're not gonna get any guff from me.
Anyway, that's where I'm at.
What are you what are you thinking?
What, um Where do you picture us?
Where do you Nick.
Nick.
Mmm, mmm.
Oh, God.
I still feel like crap.
Guys, will you, um, look at this follow-up text that I'm sending to Buster?
- It's for the little boy?
- Try to be helpful, okay?
- What are we looking at here?
- Are those nursing cats?
Winston said it was funny.
- It's not.
It's incoherent.
- No.
It's borderline pornographic.
Wait, those are not cats.
That's a human man!
What is he suck What is he sucking on?
- What Web sites are you going to?
- What are you guys doing out here?
Obviously we're creating an accidental bump-in with our hot new neighbors.
Elevator's on the move.
You got to go.
You're too hot.
You'll confuse them.
Yes, well, of course.
It's my garden party, and Zachary Quinto is not on the list.
Um, you sure you can handle that, Winston?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- Ooh.
Are you sure?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
To the right a little bit.
Up right.
- Son of a bitch.
- Okay.
Thank you so much.
We'll get you some nice cold lemonade after this, okay?
Ooh, be careful.
Oh!
Good Lord.
You know what, we don't have to talk about the future.
- Let's just put this toy together.
- I want to talk about the future.
- Okay.
Great.
All right.
- I would love to talk about it.
Yes, great.
I always thought it would be cool to be a long-haul trucker.
You want to be a long-haul trucker with a family?
No, the family would be in Montana.
Or-or Mars Landing, you know, if the government finally steps up.
Where is Mars Landing?
Where is Mars Landing?
It's on M It's on Mars.
It's the American capital of Mars.
And if you don't think there's gonna be space travel in the next 20 years, then you've got your head buried in sand, girlie.
It's already basically happening.
I always thought I'd move back to Portland.
Oh.
Portland, Earth?
It's like friendly San Francisco.
Slow food, fast bicycles, great schools Education is very important to me.
That makes me happy.
It's something we agree on.
- I really want my kids to beg for it.
- What?
'Cause if you force a kid into school, he's gonna hate it.
Oh, no.
If you make a kid work and sit in the yard and grind and grind - and grind - What?
eventually, that little kid is gonna beg for education.
Then you hand it to them - like the gift that it should be.
- No!
That's why public school's a joke.
I'm so hungover and my body's shutting down and nothing you're saying makes any sense.
There is something serious I have to tell you about the future.
The name of my firstborn child has to be Reginald VelJohnson.
I lost a bet to Schmidt.
Reginald VelJohnson?
That is non-negotiable.
Unfortunately.
The dad from Family Matters?
Well, the actor who plays the dad.
The dad is Carl Winslow.
What was the bet on?
I said I could flip a big pancake and I couldn't.
How is this going to work?
!
The only upside is the original name was gonna be Ass Baby, and I kind of talked my way out of that one.
All of the guys in this building are so sweet.
- It's no problem, yeah.
- Couldn't be easier, really.
Just a p piece of cake.
We love it.
You know, it was my idea to help move.
The only reason we're doing this is because you forced us to.
If we don't help now, we'll look bad.
Yeah, now they're gonna think of us as "nice" and "helpful".
Nightmare.
Hey.
Hey.
Oh, cool!
Uh your brother?
Actually, it's my boyfriend.
Yet he's not here to help you move.
- He's out of the country.
- Oh!
Afghanistan.
Second tour.
- Ah - Oh Please thank him for, - uh, for his service.
- Yeah.
Are you and your boyfriend and Michelle and her boyfriend gonna go on a, like, double date kind of thing whenever he gets back from Afghanistan?
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She's not really the relationship type.
- Oh.
- Okay.
I'm just having fun right now.
I feel you.
No, I feel you.
Girl, I want to feel you And then there was one.
May the best man win.
- I am also involved in this.
- Winston, get out of here.
What is your problem?
And then there were three guys Here's what I'm saying: Reginald is way too shy to beg for an education.
He's very sensitive, and when he's out on the horse, all he's doing is staring at leaves and writing poems about them.
Why do I have a horse?
You know how many people are killed on a horse every year?
Hey!
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is, I'm not gonna take Reginald out on the damn lake when you're out on your space truck We're not living by the lake.
Why would I spend my hard-earned truck driver money on an Earth house?
- You make up so much science fiction - Science but you know nothing about science.
- Do you know what science is?
- Okay, science is more of a belief - than anything else.
- No.
Do you know what science is?
- Yes.
What you believe in.
- Have you ever taken a science class?
I've taught two at a community college.
When did you teach science at a community college?
I made that up.
I didn't think you were gonna fact-check me.
My kids are not gonna beg for an education, okay?
They're gonna be forced to go to school just like everybody else and they're gonna hate it!
Can I actually be very real with you for a second?
- Yes.
- Here's what I really believe: You can create a plan for your life, and then crazy things get thrown at you, and that, by the way, is the closest thing that I have to a plan.
So maybe it's crazy to talk about being an intergalactic truck driver.
But what I think is crazier is trying to plan every single detail of our future.
I think it's crazy not to.
I just can't - live that way.
- I guess we just disagree.
Well, we never agree on anything, ever, Nick.
Why are we doing this right now, Jess?
We're hungover.
Just because I want to know we're going in the same direction, - that we're on the same page.
- Yes, we are.
Well, we live on different planets!
Oh You're talking about the fake future!
I just I guess we want different things.
Clearly, we do.
- Clearly, we do.
- All right, so what are you saying?
Should we just break up?
Yeah, right.
Like we're just - gonna break up!
- Just break up!
Over what?
You don't like lakes, I don't like space.
That's okay!
This is not why people break up!
I break up with thee, sir!
I break up I don't do voices.
I think I'm still drunk.
Let's just get to the party.
- Build this toy and go.
- Yeah.
Let's do it.
We are an unstoppable toy-building team!
Yes, we are.
Yeah.
All right, well, first hurdle: the instructions are written upside-down.
Ah, it's a false alarm.
Okay, hit me.
What do you got?
Okay, take the thing - that looks like a meth lab - This thing?
and put it in the thing that looks like a pipe bomb.
- Oh, hey!
- Hey!
Now we're cooking with gas.
- We're a good team.
- I agree.
You know what, Jess and if you want to move to Portland in the future, then we're gonna move to Portland.
You know, we'll live by the lake.
I'll learn to fish, and me and Reginald will start a newsletter, you know "Lake Father, Lake Son".
And you know what?
If you want to be a long-haul trucker, I can deal with that for six months, tops.
- Yes!
- Um, this piece is a little sticky, - but I think I can just jam it.
- Ah!
- What did you just do, Jess?
- Oh.
Well, I put the swastika in the guillotine.
How is this a children's toy?
Why is it so brittle?
What is that?
I'm not sure what I've been doing.
Hey, Michelle.
Hey.
You guys are lifesavers.
You have beautiful taste, by the way.
Really.
Is this early Californian?
You know, this color, actually, it symbolizes a woman's fertility.
Huh.
I was pregnant once.
Cool.
- What-what do you know?
- Yeah.
- Thank you, guys.
- No, thank you.
- So much.
- You bet.
- All right.
Talk to you la - You see her blink at me?
Wait, you think that was a sex blink?
That wasn't a sex blink.
That was definitely a sex blink, dude.
You would not know a sex blink if it blinked you in the sex.
- What?
- It's over already, man.
You don't have a shot.
'Cause the chicks you pull are gremlins.
You did not just talk about my chicks.
My chicks look great.
Just like me.
I'm saying my chicks literally look just like me.
All of 'em.
In varying color, but they look like me.
That is super awkward, and I don't feel like you know what - you're saying right now.
- Whoops!
Oh Coach!
Oh, man, I can't believe you just did that to her vase.
Whoa!
Dude!
I will knock you out where you stand, and you in the ground.
I will pound you from the side!
I will pound you from the back!
That sounded weird.
Once again, Schmidt has found himself in a position where he is infuriated!
I will fight your face!
I will freak out so hard on you right now, you don't even know, on your face.
What are you two Oh, my goodness.
Guys!
Her study-abroad mirror?
Her dream vase?
Come on, guys.
Have some self-respect.
We're Hey, Jess?
I don't think that belongs there.
That's why it doesn't fit in.
Well, I don't think this water bottle goes here, either.
But you put it there.
Well, why did we take the toy out of the box?
We could have just given the box to the kid.
What does he know?
He's one.
He eats pennies.
And he poos in his pants.
Because not putting the toy together is lazy.
- So, if we can't put the toy together - I-I know, but it's not gonna fit.
You can't just keep pushing it because it Oh, God.
- Okay, where's the tape?
- Oh, we used all the tape.
- Oh, you used all the tape.
- Yeah, to fix the things that you broke.
- You used a lot of duct tape.
- Actually you broke a lot of pieces.
All right, give it to me.
I'm gonna use a lighter.
And I'm gonna melt the plastic.
I'm gonna weld it together.
What?
You don't think that's a good idea?
No, you should, I think you should try it.
I also like doing Zippo tricks.
- Ow!
Aah, I burned my finger!
- What happened?
!
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
My skin's a little bubbly.
Well, I knew that was a bad idea.
Then why didn't you say anything?
Why didn't you put the toy together when I gave it to you two weeks ago?
Because I'm not Santa Claus!
I don't just put toys together two weeks in advance!
And also, it's none of my business what they want to do with the toy.
Maybe they want to return it.
Maybe they want to put it together as a family.
That is not my business.
What do you want from me, Jess?
I just want you to take a little more responsibility.
Just a little bit more.
And I want you to have a little faith in me!
I've gotten this far in my life.
And I'm doing just fine.
I mean, for the most part.
There's definitely a few blunders here and there that we could look past.
Whatever The blanket's on fire!
I can see that, Jess.
Go get a bucket.
Where is it?
In the kitchen?
No, that's for meat.
We need a different bucket.
Oh, right!
The famous meat bucket!
You said the meat bucket was a brilliant idea!
Why would I think an unrefrigerated bucket of meat was a good idea?
!
To taste what meat tasted like before electricity!
Why would you want that?
!
Why did you say it was brilliant!
?
Because, Nick if I was always honest with you then we would never stop fighting.
- Let's go!
- We have to go!
Wait, my hat!
What?
My hat.
So sorry.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Sorry.
It was uncool.
I'm so sorry!
Do you need?
Here, do you want?
Oh.
- How did this happen?
- It was Winston's fault.
He just ca he carries things wrong.
What?
!
I have heard just about enough from you two.
What?
Ow!
Winston!
Girls, I know you're both smart enough to know exactly who broke your things.
It's the same two clowns who've been trying to sex Michelle every which way from Tuesday.
I mean, I ain't gonna lie.
I've been trying to sex you every which way from Tuesday myself.
I'd be crazy not to, Michelle.
You're a very beautiful woman.
You have crazy witch eyes, and I dig it.
You're like a witch!
You know.
But I'm a good guy.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.
My name is Winston Bishop.
Welcome to the building.
Whoa, Winston, I would not that's a - Winston, what are you doing?
- That's a big - Okay.
- Aah!
- Oh!
Whoa!
- Son of a Winston, you do know that the building's on fire, right?
I got this!
Move, move!
Cece, hey.
Oh, hey, um, I didn't think you would pick up the phone.
I'll-I'll make this quick.
'Cause I'm sure you hate talking on the phone.
Oh, I actually do.
'Cause I'd much rather, um, talk in person.
You know?
Face to face?
What are you doing here?
I just, I was, uh, walking over here to see you.
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you called me.
Didn't all those texts really freak you out?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They freaked me out.
I thought you were gonna murder me.
You know, I called my mother, changed my locks.
Then I kind of, you know, had a change of heart, and I thought, "Well, you know, I like this girl".
I'd much rather just come and look at you with my eyes.
And talk to you with my face.
If you ever got off the damn phone.
- Yeah.
- Right?
- I, mm-hmm.
I understand.
- Hi, Cece.
How are you?
- Hungover?
- Yes.
Would you like to come and get some pancakes?
Yeah, I could, I could use some pancakes.
It's gonna be a bouncy ride.
My kangaroo's around the corner.
But I did bring an extra helmet.
You're lucky.
All right.
Nick, why is this so hard?
I don't want to fight all the time.
I don't know, and it's awful.
Do you ever miss when we were just friends, Jess?
And there wasn't this pressure to be together and to be - Be different people?
- Yes.
Be different people.
I'm sorry, but I'm not that guy who's gonna put the toy together.
That's just not me.
I'm the kind of guy who's gonna leave it in the box.
I don't want you to be that guy.
I-I want you to be yourself.
I want you to be yourself.
Are we?
No!
I love you!
- Well, I love you, too.
- More than I've ever loved anybody.
But what if that's the only thing we have in common?
I miss my friend.
I really miss my friend, too.
So, what does that mean?
Are we?
Yeah.
Earn this.
Was that Saving Private Ryan?
It was.
It was a hu-huge moment in that movie.
And I just, I know this is a moment.
So, um, I'll walk you to your room then, I guess.
- Schmidt is living in my room.
- Schmidt's in your room, yeah.
Yeah.
Do you think I could?
- Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's cool.
Jess?
Jess, you didn't have to run away.
I don't know what you're so afraid of.
It's just a man doing full downward facing dog in the nude.
It's a couple of testicles just hanging upside down.
I can hear you laughing in there.
Yeah, you liked it.
You telling Nick about it?
What's he saying?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
"You and Jess broke up".
Oh, man.
"The bed got burned".
I thought it was a dream.
"It was a not a dream".
I'm a little scared to see what's on the other side.
"Writing left-handed is HARB".
Oh!
Goodness.
Hi.
Sorry.
I was just changing in the closet, like Superman.
Are we still allowed to see each other naked?
- Yes.
- Do you think so?
I don't know.
- Hmm.
- Maybe.
- Ah - Definitely not.
"Derfi-niddley nit".
Boob season's over, for you.
- Mind if I grab my socks?
- Um, no.
You can go ahead.
- I'll close my eyes.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Whoa!
So how you doing?
- I'm really good.
- Good.
- How 'bout you?
- Great.
Yeah, I'm really enjoying the breakup.
- Yeah.
- I think I'm handling it well.
Yeah, you are.
You are.
You're.
You know, you're not drunk, you haven't left me And you're not crying while watching that movie Ghost.
Well, it's Dirty Dancing.
Doesn't Swayze do a dirty dance with that clay?
That's not Dirty Dancing.
It's Ghost.
It's a different movie.
Which one takes place at camp?
Dirty Dancing.
Which one's Whoopi in?
Stop asking me questions about them.
Drop it.
So I saw this TV show about monkeys in India, and one of the monkeys, when it gets nervous and it wants to play submissive, it goes like this: And that lets all the other monkeys know it doesn't want trouble.
That's cool.
They also give each other oral pleasure.
And they masturbate.
So what do we do now, Jess?
Well, normally, I would go home, but I already am home, so can't do that.
I know where you live.
And I live where you live.
Should we tell the people we live with?
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Okay.
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do What you gonna do when I come for you?
Hey, you guys, we have, um Big news!
I just got into the police academy.
Police naw give me no break - Not a solider mona give you no break - You know it.
He knows it.
- Because you are a cop.
- No, my uncle was on Cops a bunch of times.
He got no residuals, though.
He's poor.
That really is big news!
Big news.
What a happy, happy day!
Huzzah!
And to celebrate, I'm gonna have a banquet in my honor.
A banquet for yourself?
That seems tacky.
Can anyone here think of any reason why today should not be all about me?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
So I guess we're not telling anyone today.
Nah, it doesn't seem like the right move.
Yeah.
So we have to pretend to be a couple for one more day.
It's not that big of a deal.
- It's gonna be easy.
- Yeah.
So we broke up.
What's the difference?
Um I-I couldn't be more okay with it.
Well, I couldn't be more okay, either.
Great.
Me, too.
Capital "O," capital "K" capital "A," capital "Y".
I'm okay.
I'm not okay, Mom.
I'm not okay.
I'm not okay.
I'm sorry to pull you out of your dance class.
Oh, the recital was today?
I know we did the right thing, I just I feel like really upset, and Nick seems totally okay and I guess I just need someone to tell me it's gonna be fine.
It's not gonna be fine, Jess.
I'm never gonna be a grandmother!
What?
Mom Stop crying.
You don't even have to love him, honey.
You just have to get that sperm cooking!
- Mom - I'm sorry, honey, I just You know, this is where I'm at right now.
Well, this was really comforting, Mom.
It's like I'm in the womb, sucking my thumb.
Look, of course she doesn't know I'm in pain, Tran.
I'm hiding it like you're supposed to.
But I'm lying to my best friend.
You're also my best friend, don't don't start that weird jazz train.
I don't know how I'm gonna hold it all together.
I can't talk about it with anyone all day.
I feel like a piÃ±ata, you know, and I'm just gonna pop.
What does that mean: "The problem is the solution"?
Oh, you mean just focus myself on Winston, and I won't have time to think about Jess.
That's really smart, but that's not exactly "the problem is the solution".
Do you know what I mean?
That's, like, a cool sentence, but it's more just "stay busy," right?
Thanks, Tran.
If I'd met you in your prime, during the war, that would have been glorious!
But then we would've been enemies and tried to murder one another, unless we formed an alliance.
Oh You and me forming an alliance in an old-school war?
That's a fantasy.
Or a novel.
You just gave me another idea.
Winston?
I've been thinking about it, and a banquet is not big enough.
You're not retiring from some insurance company.
So what do you really want, besides a piÃ±ata?
Dream big.
Dream big, he said.
Okay.
Um If I had my druthers you know, 100% of my druthers I I gotta go Honey Roast.
The hell is that?
And don't say it like it's some thing we know!
It's a roast, except you say nice things about me.
Honey Roast.
- Huh.
- You know?
Well, I can't wait to make that happen for you.
- You serious?
- He thinks you're serious.
- How do I do it?
- You just get everybody to say a bunch of cute stuff about me.
You know, all the, like, funny stuff that makes me sweet, you know?
Done!
What else?
What?
There's There's more?
Uh make me a prominent chair.
- Like a throne?
- Come on.
A throne?
Who am I, CeeLo?
No, I just This is me, I'm still the same person.
- Stop touching me.
- I'm not gonna change.
- I'm still the same person.
- Stop touching me.
So make me a prominent chair.
Then you shall have that, Winston.
What else you want?
I'm thinking maybe you should MC my roast.
Okay, I will.
And can you do it dressed as Furguson?
I'm not gonna do that.
Thought it might be special.
Nah, it's strange.
All right, I'm gonna get started on that chair.
Well, this just in: the dress code for Winston's banquet tonight is is opt is optional.
Why would he write "optional" there?
That's gotta be a mistake, right?
And they're gonna give him a gun?
What are you doing back there?
Thought it was about time I graduated high school.
- Mmm - I'm proud of you.
That's it?
No snide comments?
I've got legions.
But I'm gonna be supportive.
"Legions" means "a lot".
I know what "legions" means.
Anyway, I probably won't even take the test.
I failed the last five practice exams.
So that seems like a bad sign.
Of course you're failing.
You're studying here in a rowdy tavern.
Chumbawamba's playing, it's not even "Tubthumping".
You're writing with what looks to be a golf pencil.
Where are your flash cards?
Do you not have o-one single flash card?
There's maraschino goo everywhere!
You don't have a flash card?
I'm taking over.
You need a tutor.
Yes, I'll do it.
You realize I have a boyfriend, right?
Oh, the hunky Australian boy?
Congratulations.
Cece, this is about your education.
- Nothing more.
- Mm.
He's actually from Perth, so Perth is in Australia, Cece.
We'll start with geography.
Oh, Cece, I really need to ask Schmidt if my outfit's working.
It is not.
I was in the middle of tutoring Cece!
- Make it quick!
- I know why you're upset, okay?
I should've asked you to tutor me.
But he just volunteered, and I figured you'd be busy with Nick.
Well, I'm not busy with Nick anymore.
Oh, no.
Did you guys break up?
Jess, are you pregnant?
I feel like I made it weird with the pregnancy thing, you guys.
Did I make it weird with the pregnancy thing?
'Cause I really feel like I did.
I feel like, in my heart, that that was a that was the wrong to say, especially to two women who are sitting alone in a room together.
You know, I don't know where you guys are at with your lives But you're certainly getting up to an age where babies are on your mind, and-and I didn't want to throw that into the mix.
I could see that you were emotional, Jess, when you left, and I, and I don't want to make you more emotional by bringing up pregnancy.
And, Cece, you can probably barely spell "pregnancy".
And I feel terrible.
Are you frickin' razzing me in there?
Did I just here a razz?
Damn it!
So you're really building Winston's throne, huh?
It's a prominent chair.
And it's not right!
It's not regal enough!
- How long have you been doing this?
- It's for the Honey Roast.
I'm trying to think of cute things to say about Winston.
I got great stuff about his feet.
What are you saying, dude?
You sound insane.
If anything's cute about Winston, it's his yawn.
He goes, like - Can I use that?
- You're scaring me, man.
Like, for real.
Like, I'm scared for you.
Don't do that voice 'cause it makes me confess things.
I'm really scared for you.
- I broke up with Jess.
- You broke - You broke up with Jess?
!
- I broke up with Jess.
- Aw, man.
- It's real.
Or she broke up with me, I don't know, but we're broken up.
Well, at least that explains all of that.
Kind of.
I just feel like I'm falling apart.
Like, my brain feels like spaghetti.
And my future feels like a dark hole that I can't stop falling down.
You can't show her this pain.
Or she'll freak out and it'll be over, okay?
I wish someone would've told me that when Malia and I broke up.
Malia, I'm in pain and I want you to know!
I want to get this pain out of my body!
I haven't seen her since.
I still read her e-mails, though.
- Every day.
- Every day.
- Every damn day.
- Every day.
You have to hide your feelings no matter what.
And I am.
She thinks I'm okay.
That's my game plan.
I'm talking about pills, man.
Schmidt's got some anxiety pills in his top drawer, you know?
- That's a great idea.
- Do it.
Don't tell any of the roommates about the breakup.
Thought I made it clear that I do not want to talk about this.
Sure.
He just seemed so fine with it.
Like he's happier than me watching Coach watching Winston yawn.
I'm sure he's just as sad as you are.
It's an act.
You need to go and talk to him so he can tell you how he really feels.
I'll go with you, okay?
- Thanks.
- Of course.
Are you guys Frenching?
Okay, say you're Frenching and I'll stop knocking.
Ignore him, okay?
Just ignore him.
Remember Cece, no one knows we broke up.
- Not a word.
- Nope.
- Hey!
- Come here, you.
Why are we doing this?
Uh this is, uh, how I, how I greet everyone now.
And then I, uh, do this.
- Then do that.
- Oh.
And top it off with a little bit of that.
You feel me?
This is how you greet everybody now?
Ah, come here, you.
Uh, that wasn't an invitation.
Nick, hi!
Son of a bitch!
Come here, you.
What are you doing, man?
- You take the pills?
- Uh, I feel as if I'm of cotton.
Sorry for what's about to happen.
Do you have a minute to maybe have a conversation with your sweet, sweet girlfriend?
I think the only way we're gonna get through this is if we're really honest with each other about how we're really feeling.
This morning I told you I was okay, and Why are you winking at me?
- Am I winking?
- Yeah.
I think I'm just a little nervous.
I'm gonna put my sunglasses on so we can keep talking.
- Okay, okay.
- 'Cause I don't think I can stop this.
Please continue with what you were saying.
Um, I just, um, want you to tell me how you really feel.
- Great.
- Gre I'm sorry, "Great"?
- I feel great.
- Is great the, the, uh, is the emotion you feel right now?
- No.
- Oh.
I feel amazing.
- "Amazing"?
- Yeah.
You feel amazing right now?
I just feel happier and amazing and lighter.
Tonight's about Winston.
You don't have to worry about me 'cause I'm worried about the Honey Roast.
I'm sorry I forgot that Winston is the most important thing that's going on today.
That's where I'm putting all my energies.
Fan tastic.
Took a long time to say that word.
There you are!
- We're supposed to be studying.
- Come here, you.
Ah, thanks, Coach.
I needed this.
Mm.
Delightful.
To you, too, my friend.
That is super weird.
What is wrong with you?
What are you scared of a couple practice tests?
Just something more important came up, that's all.
There should be nothing more important to you, Cece, than your future.
Because nothing is more important to me than your future.
Do you know how stupid it makes me feel to care more about your future than you do?
Nick and Jess broke up.
I knew you knew!
- Oh!
- I knew it!
So, you knew, too.
But you knew and you told.
Look, that was so sweet of you, Schmidt.
Okay?
And thank you for believing in me - Who gives a rat's A?
!
- Hmm?
Nick and Jess break up.
and you spring this on me like a, like it's a freaking weather report?
I am a child of divorce!
I'm delicate!
Should've graduated the first time around, you buffoon!
Better keep it together, dude.
No one can know you know.
Guess what, Cece?
My boyfriend Nick is totally frickin' fine.
He's actually, he's "amazing".
Okay, wine.
Yeah, make it a big one.
A holiday pour.
'Cause today's all about Winston.
Yeah, it's all about Winston.
Somebody say Winston?
- Whoa!
- What?
Guys, I gotta say, I am walking on air, I really am.
It's, uh Excuse me for a second.
Hey, Winston!
Hey, it's your day!
I'm diving in!
What can I do?
'Cause today is all about Winston.
Yeah, all about Winston.
- Whatever you want, buddy.
- Mm-hmm.
Anything?
My name is Nick Miller and I'm your host of tonight's Honey Roast.
Thank you!
Thank you!
And I'm Furguson the cat.
Ya-ya!
Okay, uh, tonight's Honey Roast, we're gonna keep it sweet, keep it positive, and most of all, we're gonna keep it cute.
Am I right, Furguson?
Hope that cat's not driving.
How is a cat costume just lying around?
She has four of them.
I'm drinking a "Catbernet".
- That's pretty good.
- Okay.
That's pretty good.
A Pinot "meowoir" Meow-oi-rr.
If I have one more of these, you're gonna have to point this old kitty in the direction of my litter box because I'm gonna need to find it.
Mm, let's keep it cute, guys.
'Cause I'm gonna have to pee.
Speaking of cute, Winston Bishop is so cute How cute is he?
How cute am I?
Teddy bears buy Winston for their kids.
That was good.
That is exactly how cute I am.
- Horrible visual.
- Want to know how cute you are?
Yeah, I want to know how cute I am.
You want to know how cute you are?
I want to know how cute I am.
Puppys put him Not gonna do that one.
Are we still pretending that we don't - Relax.
Keep it together.
- Mm-hmm, it'll be over soon.
- Pretend like you're enjoying this.
Smile.
- Mm-hmm.
Winston is so cute, he once met a Japanese gal named Ariko, and she started wearing him as a backpack!
Boom!
Ooh!
I did not see that one coming!
Oh, my!
- I didn't expect it either.
- Surprise ending!
I think it's time, I think it's time that this cat takes over.
Why hold back?
I feel like we should make this - a real roast.
- Yeah.
- Don't do that.
- Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
I'm kind of scared, but I'm also kind of excited.
- I think, actually, it's my turn to - It's my turn!
- Uh mm-mm.
- Okay, back here.
This is the best idea.
I think I should sit down.
Getting a little mean.
Time to add some honey.
Who's in the house?
Coach is in the house.
What-what?
What's up, Coach?
You have so many sweatpants, you need to buy normal pants.
Cece here.
You guys know Cece.
- Your hair's so long.
- Well, you're basically busted.
- Good one.
- That was good.
- That was really a good one.
- That was a good one.
- Schmidt - Jess, please, don't.
I'm very fragile right now.
Your head's so big.
That actually wasn't that bad.
You got a big-ass head, dude!
And Nick Miller Oh, boy.
What can I say about Nick that hasn't already been said?
Oh, here we go.
Nick calls birds "wind mice".
Think about it.
- Nick says "Yahtzee" when he climaxes.
- Oh, boy.
He calls turtles "shell beavers".
Well, that's what they should be called.
They're green.
Beavers are brown.
We've had this argument and we have agreed to not talk about it in front of others.
But you know the worst, worst, worst thing about Nick?
- You don't have to say it.
You just - Mm-mm, mm-mm.
He's okay.
He's okay.
And I am not okay.
I'm not okay.
What are you talking about?
Are you nuts?
I'm falling apart.
Yeah, I I'm on Schmidt's anti-anxiety medicine.
What?
!
Yeah, I stole it from his drawer.
Schmidty's little helpers.
- Ooh.
- Sorry about that.
I'm very much not okay!
I was only acting okay 'cause I thought you were okay.
- I'm not okay.
- I am not okay.
I'm terrible!
I know I'm smiling right now, but I feel terrible.
- I'm so happy - Yeah.
that you feel terrible.
It's a devastating breakup.
- You know, I know we lived together.
- It's really hard.
- It's tricky, you know?
- Yeah.
- You know, it sucks.
- I really thought we had a future.
Me, too.
Yeah, saw the whole thing, the whole thing.
- And now we don't.
It's done, yeah.
- We have nothing in common.
Yeah.
I also can't stop smiling because of the drugs, so my face feels crazy.
It feels like I had plastic surgery.
Can somebody please tell me what the hell is going on in here?
- You want to do this?
- I think we should.
We broke up!
- We're done.
It's over.
- It's all done.
- Are you serious?
!
What?
!
- What?
!
No!
Come on, guys, it's so obvious.
- Son of a bee sting.
- I mean What, you broke up today?
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday.
Well, why didn't you tell me?
Because we didn't want to ruin your day.
And I'm so sorry we did.
We're so proud of you that you got into the police academy, but we're just, we're in a really bad zone.
- Yeah, a too bad zone.
- So let's just come out and admit it.
We're in a terrible zone.
Are you kidding me?
Something this big happens and you guys still look out for me?
I mean, that's Thank you.
I really appreciate it, you guys, but I'm here for whatever you need.
Thank you, buddy.
Look, I know this is super weird and definitely high on anxiety pills but I'd like everybody to hold hands in this moment.
- No.
- Just do it, man.
That's it.
- Everybody?
- Oh.
- It's two ladies.
- I'm okay.
This feels good.
Om Let's never tell anyone we did this.
Should we all try to live inside a peach, or is that weird?
Guys, in light of what's been going on, I will be postponing the Honey Roast - until tomorrow night.
- Okay.
- Ah!
- No.
- No way.
- Not doing this.
We could say everybody come back, - Sorry, Winston.
- everybody come back the same time, so then you guys all get to wear white.
Hi, again.
I'm watching Dirty Dancing.
I know.
I've heard all three screenings.
I just don't understand how Penny got in trouble.
Well, you know, it was a different time.
Who wins in a fight?
Swayze from Dirty Dancing or Swayze from Roadhouse?
I think, uh, To Wong Foo Swayze would win.
Jess, this is really hard.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to call you.
It's like a riddle.
I know!
I don't know where to change or where to sleep or where to go to the bathroom.
Well, I know where to go to the bathroom.
But you know, the social component.
Oh, no.
I'm out of tissues.
I got it.
Heads up!
Oh!
Hey.
Thank you.
No problem.
That's what I'm here for.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
Hungry eyes One look at you and I can't disguise guise, I got hungry eyes
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thanks for helping me with my school dance.
"Love is forever, and ever, and ever, and" - How many "and ever"s?
- Technically infinity, but I could only fit 12.
Well, this is going to be tough for you, huh?
Yes!
Foster said we couldn't afford it, but I really stuck my neck out for this dance.
No, I-I mean because the theme of the dance is "Love is forever" and Nick, and the breakup What?
No, Cece, look, you remember what school dances were like for me.
They were miserable.
I was just waiting in the bathroom for Tim Keymaker to magically appear and ask me out.
I remember.
I was smoking in the stall next to you.
We get it, you were bad.
I just don't want it to be like it was for me.
I want them to have an incredible time.
My life is a bit of a mess right now, but the one thing I can do is throw an amazing dance for them.
"Love is forever, and ever, and ever" - What is this?
- The theme of Jess's school dance.
- It's pretty ironic, huh?
- Jess, you poor thing.
- Come-come here.
Come here.
- What?
What?
Just there.
- What are you doing?
- All right.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Oh, I know.
I know.
- I know.
- What's happening?
I got hug number two locked and loaded.
Soft or hard, it's up to you.
- I know.
- Schmidt Ay-ay-ay, I needed a shvitz.
Ech, me, too.
My arms are so sore from doing so many push-ups.
That seems like a lie.
No, I'm trying to stay fit after the breakup.
I've been eating salads, yeah, no dressing, - mostly just the protein.
- What kind of salad you've been eating?
- The little chopped of pieces of ham.
- Just the ham?
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
I don't like the lettuce.
I think it's gross to eat stuff on earth that's green.
- Well, look, you know baby steps - Not baby steps, - there were some pretty big pieces of ham.
- Okay.
It's still not as good.
I genuinely miss goofing around with Jess.
Breakups aren't supposed to be easy, so Well, it's really mature of you, man.
We're doing something where we are we are not allowed to be in the room alone together without Winston.
'Cause he just naturally takes the sexual tension out of a room.
What'd you guys want?
You see?
I'm proud of you.
That's what I'm talking about.
We're men.
We've felt pain, we've survived it.
Look at me.
I'm watching Cece drool over some 20-year-old.
How could she be interested in a boy when she could have these ripe berries?
Look at these, Nick.
Put your towel down.
Oh, God, I need a shvitz.
Why does my sweat smell like asparagus?
He does take all the sexual tension out of a room.
Man, I heat up every room I walk into.
Put me next to a dozen eggs.
They hatching.
You know why?
'Cause I got the heat of a mother hen.
There was no sexual tension in here before he got here.
Keep telling yourself that, Nick.
Congrats, chaperones!
With your help, tonight is going to be unforgettable.
I didn't sign up for this.
No, you didn't.
None of you did.
In fact, none of you have ever, ever signed up for any school event, ever.
Which means you've never felt the joy of exchanging your free time for a child's smile.
I never volunteer because of my Munchausen syndrome.
Are we getting paid?
You will get paid, um, actually, in attractive hats that I made.
They say "chaperone".
And Gary the Janitor has one that says "clean up crew".
You call me Gary the Janitor as if me being a janitor is my whole identity.
It's like someone calling you Jess the Third-Hottest White Teacher.
Okay.
Are we done?
I'm gonna say we're done.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank-thanks, guys.
Good-good meeting.
I don't know where I'm supposed to be right now.
Thanks, guys.
It's gonna be great!
You don't have to wear that, Coach.
As far as I'm concerned, this dance starts now.
I know how important this dance is to you.
Those kids won't get away with anything.
They want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me.
Wait.
If they want to bang, they're gonna have to bang through me!
Wait.
Hey, Wendy.
Whoa!
That shirt's scary!
Whoa.
You going to the dance tonight?
My mom's making me go.
Making you go to the best night of your life?
Your mom sounds really cool.
Come one, at your age, love is forever and ever and ever.
What are you gonna wear?
This shirt.
Oh.
Oh!
That is the best idea I've heard all week.
Whoa!
Scary shirt!
We all think that you're an idiot for dating this 14-year-old.
He's 20.
That means he was seven when Good Will Hunting came out.
Seven, Cece.
Good Will Hunting.
You know what?
Let me go, let me go, let me go.
Um, check this out.
Cece's boyfriend is so young that It'll come back to me.
Buster is more of a man than all of you.
Okay?
He's been to, like, 40 countries, he builds boats, he used to train snakes with his uncle.
Earning a respectable wage, wearing a proper-hanging pair of slacks, ordering sushi like a sick-ass boss - These things a man maketh.
- So stupid stuff that you do.
I know that technically you guys are men, but all you do is hang out with each other, like you're 12.
What do you know?
You're just a stupid girl.
Okay, I got it, I got it.
Okay, Cece's boyfriend is so young that - How-how young is he?
- Winston.
It's not working, man.
I'm serious.
- I'm at my wit's end with you.
- What?
Wait a minute.
Why's the door locked?
The dance starts in five minutes.
- Okay.
- Gary!
Thank God you're here.
Can you unlock the door?
No.
I didn't put that there.
What?
Who else could have done it?
We can't start the dance if the door's locked.
Don't tell me I wore my raw denim for no reason.
Don't you dare tell me that!
I am not telling you that.
So the dance is cancelled, then?
No, no, no.
There is gonna be a dance.
It's gonna be great and perfect and lovely and it will celebrate love is forever and ever and ever.
Where are you guys going?
In life, nowhere.
But I know I don't want to be here.
Guys, please stay.
It would really mean a lot to me.
Boring.
It's Jess.
All of her chaperones just bailed, and she needs help.
A lady needs help?
Is that a job for a boy?
- No.
- Or a - Man!
- man?
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Men!
Well, the dummy patrol is ready.
- Men!
Men!
Men!
- Aah!
Men.
Man!
- So stupid.
- Seriously, are you okay for real?
- You got any ice?
- Dude, rub his shoulder.
Rub his shoulder.
- I'll get ice.
I'll get ice.
- My shoulder go into his.
You all right?
- Ow, man!
- Okay, all right, just sit back.
Nick, get the ice!
- How do you know how to do that?
- Well, a tire iron is actually strong enough to break through a high-carbon steel steering wheel lock, so, you know, I figured I'd work with this.
Cece scares me sometimes.
It's just the tip of the iceberg, my friend.
- Got it.
There we go.
- Oh!
Yes!
Everything's back on track, guys!
This bike lock was a real punk move.
Seems like there's a lot of punks here.
Did you do this?
- Hey.
You did this?
Huh?
You did this?
- Hey, easy, easy.
If anyone's messing with this dance, it's one of those teachers Those hats were begging for payback.
- Let's do this.
- Hey.
Listen up, chaperones.
You will obey all of my instructions.
This means everything to Jess.
Your asses belong to me now.
Which means I currently have four asses.
The three of yours and mine.
I think we're capable of handling a bunch of prepubescent kids.
Do you think you are tough, Winston?
You have no idea what these little bastards are capable of.
I mean, I love them.
I love them with all my heart.
But they will hurt your feelings sometimes.
He's right.
I remember sticks and stones may break your bones, but not if you're a fat kid with calcium deficiency.
Schmidt, you're on snack table duty.
Keep the chip bowls full.
Don't let the kids spike the punch.
And make sure Diabetic Amy only has four cookies.
Diabetic Amy ain't gonna get no cookies on my watch.
No, she-she has to have at least two or she'll pass out.
She's getting nothing as far as I'm concerned.
At least two, at least two or she'll pass out.
- All right, Winston?
Dance floor duty.
- Yes, sir.
Ooh, you shouldn't have said that, man, that is the perfect place for me right now.
I got - so much heat coming off me, man.
- No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No heat.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- No heat.
Hey, hey, hey.
None.
Hey, look at me.
No heat.
The opposite of heat.
Six inches separation at all times.
Nobody's getting pregnant tonight.
That's the same thing I say on my dates.
Not cool.
- Let's hit it.
- Hey, hey.
Saving the best for last?
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick, uh, you're not chaperone material.
I've been at this job for a few weeks now and I know the stink of a bad kid.
That makes me the perfect candidate to be a chaperone, Coach.
Just think about it.
I can get in the mind of a bad kid.
Think like 'em, go deep.
I can go too deep.
I'm gonna put you in the parking lot to sweep for stragglers.
- You want me on the streets.
- It's not that important of a job.
I won't let you down.
I'm not gonna let you down!
You taking a a break right now?
When the heat moves you, you got to move Okay, no heat.
No heat.
No heat, Bishop, no heat.
Keep that heat locked up.
Keep that heat Think you're going, baby I, this is Crazy.
Put that heat away, Bishop.
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
You got that, man.
You got What are you looking at?
Cool mustache.
Too much heat.
Too much heat.
All right, kids, let's use the serving tongs.
This isn't Appalachia.
Hurry up, everybody, before Justin eats everything.
Son, I don't think you meant to hurt Justin's feelings, there.
What's going on, really?
Are the parents fighting at home?
Leave me alone, flamer.
Flamer?
You're the You're the flamer, pal.
- You're the flamer.
- You're the flamer.
- Flamer.
- Stop saying that word, it's probably - offensive to some people, you flamer.
- Flamer, flamer.
- Yeah, take a doughnut, there, you flamer.
- Flamer.
Schmidt.
I got a bit of a situation here.
Um, thoughts?
Advice?
What now?
Aw, son of a b penis.
Ah, that wasn't better.
Sorry, everyone.
You were right.
Someone's trying to mess with my dance.
Hmm.
It's paste.
And it's fresh.
Banana in the dark.
Uh-oh.
You ruined my dance.
I can smell the paste.
Perpetrator!
He's in there.
Okay, when we get in there, I'm going to be good cop, you be bad cop, okay?
Got it.
There are two ways this can go.
Number one: you tell us why you ruined the dance.
Number two: I bash your skull in with a carburetor!
- I thought I was bad cop.
- You are the bad cop.
I'm the tough, competent cop, who's good at her job, you're the kind of fumbly, dumb cop - who's nice and - Yeah, that's not how it works, though.
I mean, the good cop is nice and the bad cop is mean.
- That would be nice cop, mean cop.
- It's how it works - on every cop show, when you watch it.
- I watch cop shows.
- You need to pay more attention.
- I do pay attention - What do you awful women want?
- We want to know why you locked the door and poured glue in the breaker.
I didn't do any of that.
Why would anybody want to ruin such a magical night?
Uh, you're the only one who wanted to have this stupid dance.
Revenge would be my guess.
What do you know?
Well, you have the grip of a much taller woman.
And I don't not like that.
Ugh.
some fireworks or something.
What's up, gentlemen?
Just hanging out outside in the parking lot?
We're not doing anything.
We don't need a chaperone.
Calling me a 'rone?
I'm not a 'rone.
I'm basically the same guy as you.
We're wearing the same shirt.
I'm a good guy, I'm having fun.
I'm just I'm bored in there, I'm looking to hang out.
Is that a crime, officers?
Say, you guys got any Billy Whizz?
Any juice, any sweet Mary Jane?
I'm looking.
Okay, if you're really not a chaperone why don't you take a sip of this?
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
I got nothing to prove.
Are you a 'rone or not?
Give me that.
What is that?
Is that a suicide?
- The soda flavors all mix together.
- You know it, bro.
That was super intense.
Sorry, I spit some of it up.
He's cool.
Hey, buddy, uh, Tommy, is it?
I just I just wanted to apologize for what happened before, kiddo.
What, are you gonna propose to me, now?
That's funny.
No, I I get it.
You know, when I when I was young, I too found that humor can be a useful tool.
Dude, get up, I'm not gonna marry you.
I, too, found that humor can be a a useful tool.
And then you grow up and you become a man.
Well, you smell like a woman.
That's it, enough is enough with you.
You think you're a tough guy, tough guy?
Prove it, man.
Name the time and place.
- Fist fight?
- Foot race.
- A what?
- Yeah, you heard me foot race, man.
I'll run circles around you and all your pals.
Oh.
You girls are multiplying like bunnies.
That's weird.
Lot more of you than there is of me.
We should lock all the doors.
No one gets in, no one gets out.
The culprit's inside.
It's frickin' Gosford Park!
You need to just calm down a little, Jess.
I can't calm down!
I want this to be perfect.
I know, but it's too late for that, okay?
There are kids doing their homework in there.
It's bleak.
I know after what happened with Nick you wanted this to go great, but it's not your fault that the dance got messed up, all right?
You'll get 'em next time.
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Oh, that was a sugar rush, man.
That's a buzz in the brain!
Ooh, ooh!
You guys see how high I just got?
I'm good.
He ain't a 'rone.
Too dumb.
Aw, this is fun, man!
I miss this!
I really do, man.
Let's keep going.
Let's get burgers.
Meet some girls.
Different ages, man.
It's so early!
Hey, we got something to show you.
Look, guys, we had a lot of fun, but we can get in a lot of trouble for doing this.
Which is why you gotta run really fast when it goes off.
Like now!
- Oh, dude!
- Go!
I mean it!
Go!
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
What are we gonna do now?
Let's ride.
Oh, hell yeah!
Wendy?
Busted.
Well, you really did come prepared, Wendy.
A wrench some glue a box of tampons?
What were you gonna do with this?
Um Oh.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
So you really didn't want the dance to happen?
None of the boys want to dance with me.
Jess?
Hey, Cece.
Hey.
This is Wendy.
She was just telling me how she doesn't like to dance with boys.
Oh.
Yeah.
Well that makes sense because boys are the dumbest.
You're just saying that.
No.
No, no.
No.
Cece and I have met so many boys, and they are all so dumb.
Yeah, and I've met more than her, so Yeah, and Cece has met more than me because she is nicer than me.
- Nicer?
- I just mean you've met 'cause you're well-traveled.
- "Well-traveled" is how we're gonna say it?
- I mean - You better tread lightly.
- I will Travel You travel a lot.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think I'm ever gonna dance with a boy.
Listen, are boys dumb?
Yes.
Yes!
Do they do disappointing, stupid, stupid things that really hurt your feelings?
Yes.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you plan them actually, they never work out the way you plan them but, in the end, it's all worth it, and that's why you have to try.
Are you talking about sex or dancing?
- Dancing.
- Dancing.
Oh, God.
Dancing, dancing.
- We're talking about dancing.
- Upright dancing.
Okay.
I'll try.
So let's get back out there.
Oh, Cece, it's okay.
There's no light, no music.
The dance is over.
Oh, no, this dance is not over.
We just need to find some stupid boys.
You look so slow.
Like a s like a s super dumb, slow turtle.
- I'm so fast, and you're so old.
- So much like a like a turtle, it's crazy to me.
Are we gonna do this or what?
Oh, yeah, we're gonna do this.
I'm like a Hebrew cheetah.
On the count of three.
One two thr Flo-Jo!
Flo-Jo!
What are you doing?
Hello?

All students inside now!
Go, go, go, go, go, go.
You three are the worst chaperones possible on earth.
A dog would be better than you.
A plant wearing underwear would be better than you.
Ray Charles' ghost would be better than you!
Wh what kind of men are you?
Hey!
Stupid boys!
We need ya.
Who's ready to have a good time?
The lights went out, and you made your own light.
The music went out, and we're gonna make our own music.

You're just kids, so you're all from here.
- Somebody else, go.
- That was it?
Yeah.
Gonna be a cop, straight walking a beat Role model, out on the street Unless I get assigned to a desk, which is also vital Because when paperwork slides, that's how you get a mistrial When I say "miss," you say "trial".
- Miss.

I said, when I say "miss," you say "trial".
Miss, unless you trying to die.
What, are you nuts?

One, two, one, two.
Here we go.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Guys, we're going on a cruise and you guys are coming with us.
And none of you have a choice.
A cruise?
If I wanted to watch a heavy-set guy in sandals eating with his hands, I would've just posted up and watched Nick in the kitchen.
When we were together, we booked a cruise.
We tried to get our money back, but it's Nonrefundable.
Yeah.
They made that very clear.
Seemed like a safe bet at the time.
I don't want a refund on my cruises and I don't want a refund on you.
We're never gonna die!
- Yeah!
- Y'all nasty.
Ah-ha-ha, yeah!
Where you going?
- Yes!
- What are you doing now?
Oh, there she goes Turns out, I do want a refund On you.
Give me my money back!
Anyway, they let us downgrade our "lovers' suite" to include four more people.
And that's you guys.
I have some concerns about going on a cruise with two people that just broke up.
- Absolutely.
- Me, too.
- Yeah, I have the same concern as Winnie.
Like, I don't want to go.
I have strong qualms as well.
He got qualms.
Put those qualms away.
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine, okay?
- Totally.
- We are killing this breakup, honestly.
But we're gonna be on a ship in the middle of the ocean with no escape.
What if you guys get in a big fight and we're stuck out there with you?
It'll be like a floating, all-you-can-eat prison.
I promise you no weirdness.
Guess that's an excuse to go out and buy a new bikini.
- Which could be good.
- I'm in.
Full steam ahead!
We have two on board!
Nope!
Let's not do, uh, nautical puns, please.
If we're gonna do nautical puns, we shouldn't We shouldn't go.
That's fair, and I won't.
I'm in, too.
Uh, I have an idea.
Just throwing this out there.
What if we do the cruise on the ground?
- Like, on land.
- That's silly.
What, are you scared of boats or something?
Afraid me, afraid of boats?
You're afraid of boats, dude.
Ha!
He's scared of boats?
Hold on, hold on.
Oh, my God, you're scared of boats.
Dude!
Is it the boats or the water?
Can you swim?
Yeah.
You feel safe now?
I'm not I don't need to be safe, man.
I'm brave!
I take dumps standing up!
I'm a man!
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Schmidt, do you got any Fisherman's pants I can borrow?
What's that?
It's a class ring for Cece.
She got her ged and I've been tutoring her, so I had this made.
What?
Shame, shame, I know your name Please don't "shame, shame" me, Winston.
You're still in love with her.
I am not still in love with her, okay?
You're alone on a boat with Cece, romantic cruise, and you give her jewelry.
Then what?
I tell her that I'm still in love with her and that I want her back, and then we have sex until the boat sinks.
I knew it, I knew it!
To the bottom of the ocean.
To the bottom of the ocean.
Oh, man the sand and the mackerel and the chum and whatever the hell else is down there.
- And crabs.
- Not the crabs.
- Yeah.
- Don't tell anyone.
I'm serious, Winston.
Do not tell anyone.
What are you doing?
You are so weird.
Can you ever just leave the room like a normal person?
Cruise!
Cruise!
Cruise!
Cruise!
Cruise!

A little tight.
With the amount of stuff we're gonna be doing, we're barely gonna be in the room.
Cruise!

Cruise!
Cruise!

Cruise!
Cru I'm gonna get drunk!
Sorry.
Enthusiasm!
I like these people.
Friendship is the most crucial ingredient to any sea adventure.
Second only to buoyancy.
Because a ship has to float.
Ah!
Oh, okay.
I didn't know where you was going with it.
We love you, captain!
Whoo-hoo!
Everybody, my name is Doug.
Hi, Doug.
Hi, Doug.
Hey, Doug.
I'm Winston.
Does anyone know what to do in case of an emergency?
Uh-oh.
It looks like we're all in the same boat.
Excuse me.
If we could just continue on without any more nautical puns, that'd be great.
Feels like that's just the lowest form of humor.
Looks like I found a grumpy Gus!
- I'm sorry, a what?
- Boo!
- Boo - Boo and hiss!
Boo.
Folks, if you see Gus frowning around, brighten up his day by giving him a tickle.
- A what?
- Tickle.
- Quit it!
Enough!
- Tickle.
Tickles I don't like to be tickled, you guys.
- Tickle, tickle - All right!
Enough!
We have fun!
But the ocean does not.
What?
Listen to what I have to say if you don't want to die.
Don't worry, Coach.
Everyone who works on a cruise ship is a performer.
- They're just doing a show.
- So what?
What are you talking to me about it for?
- I'm not scared.
- I just thought you should know.
- You're definitely scared.
Sure.
- I'm not scared, dude.
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, no, of course.
- I'm not scared.
- You'll live.
It's okay.
Okay, now I need a volunteer to help me with some emergency procedures.
I'll do it.
I don't care.
'Cause I'm not scared.
I'll volunteer my ass off.
I ain't afraid of you!
- Let's say it's 3:00 A.M. - 3:00 A.M. - There's alarms going off - What?
freezing seawater up to your ankles.
Adults are screaming, babies are crying!
Go, go, go, go, go!
You're up on deck!
There's an Italian guy strapping chains together!
- You don't know what's going on!
- I know!
- What do you do?
- I don't know!
What do I do?
- What do you do?
What do you do?
- I-I get, I get in the boat?
- You get in the boat!
- I get in the boat!
You're getting in the boat!
- I get in the boat!
- Wrong!
Wrong!
No!
The first thing you do is you what?
Make sure your life preserver is strapped on correctly.
No, no, screw that, man!
I'm gettin' in the boat!
Get out of my way!
- I'm getting in the boat!
- Where you going, Coach?
He's paddling to heaven, 'cause he's already dead.
Don't say that!
Spread your wings, little angel.
- Douglas that's a little too much.
- Oh, my God!
Stroke!
Stroke!
- Ah, there's two of these!
- Okay all righty.
- How do you do two of these?
- Okay - You're safe.
You're okay.
- Stroke!
Stroke!
You're okay!
You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.
Shh.
Amazing grace I'm not afraid of boats.
How sweet No one's afraid.
The sound Okay, I'm good.
I'm good, I'm good.
You okay?
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming to the To the seminar.
Remember to sign up for the volleyball tournament.
Hey, Coach?
You okay, buddy?
You okay, pal?
Nah, you guys, I'm fine.
I'm just gonna I'm gonna hang out in the room for a little bit, okay?
- See you later.
- Later.
Cruise!
Cruise.
Cruise What should we do first?
Cheer up, grumpy Gus!
All right!
Cut your fingernails, man!
Ha ha!
Nice!
With this tickling.
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
The captain's coming.
It's the captain.
What's up, captain?
Hello, again.
I'm captain Jan Nortis, as I previously stated.
I would just like to say that I am a fan of your enthusiasm.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Please don't do that.
Sorry.
I may be a captain, but first and foremost, I am a woman.
Absolutely.
Come on!
Did anyone just see that she was flirting like crazy with Nick?
That was, like, the most shameless flirting I've ever seen.
"Keep it in your pants" is all I have to say to captain Jan Nortis.
- You're being really weird.
- You're being weird.
- Super weird right now.
- Here we go.
This is starting now already.
I am not being weird.
You're creating an awkward situation for no reason.
Don't do this, Jess.
If this ship moves as fast as that captain, we'll be in Ensenada by 6:00.
Well, she was flirting with you.
Which I'm okay with, because she is a handsome woman.
Jess, stop.
You're being weird.
No, I'm not being weird.
I'm not being weird!
I am, I am being weird.
Okay, focus up for a second.
Okay, they say this is an all-inclusive trip, but you know what that means.
But from their eyes, you have a couple of drinks, and then you're done.
And then what have you paid for?
We're smarter than that, okay?
We are.
We're gonna take every class, we're gonna do every activity.
We're gonna get our money's worth.
- Okay.
Got it?
- Yeah.
Uh, Jessica Day and Nick Miller.
All right, Day-Miller party.
Here is your itinerary for the grand romance package.
No!
No!
Yeah, we're looking for something more like PG-13.
What do you have?
Do you have, like, a friendship package or?
What package would you recommend for two brothers looking for trouble?
The grand romance package is nonrefundable.
Well, we're not doing that, so we're good.
Are you sure?
This includes over $600 of activities and - We're gonna do it.
- We're not doing it.
$600?
That is 600 one-dollar bills.
That's the only way I can imagine it.
- We can do this.
- Okay.
Yeah.
We're gonna get our money's worth.
We are the best ex-couple in the whole world.
Yeah, we are.
- Yes.
- Okay?
You guys are exes?
Yeah, you're not gonna want to do this.
We're doing it.
Give us the folder.
- I just wanted to say - Grumpy Gus!
No!
No!
No!
- Grumpy Gus.
- Sweet mother of sea dragon!
What?
What happened?
I just witnessed a dolphin being cut straight in half by our keel.
It's a ghastly sight.
What?
That's horrible!
Terrible.
It's a shame about the dolphin, man.
Really is.
What?
!
As your bodies become one, follow your breath through your spine to the soles of your feet and into your genitals.
What?
Into my genitals?
Yeah.
Breathe into your genitals I'm not breathing into my genitals, lady.
All right, lovers, let's get sexy.
Give me your sexiest pose right here.
This is it.
This is it.
Sexiest pose.
That's not it's not romantic in any way.
Think about the first time you kissed.
How was it?
If you can move in.
Come back in.
Come back in.
Wow, I've never done a couples massage on exes before.
In case you're wondering what that scar on his back is, it's from falling on a fence when he was six.
I was legally dead for ten minutes.
We're going to make all the towel animals you guys find in your rooms every single night!
- We made laundry.
- Nice.
We're always happy Life's for living, yeah, that's our philosophy We're just totally different people.
Yeah, we just don't belong together.
You're really bumming me out.
Hey, Jess, is this doing weird stuff to your eyes?
Definitely.
Give me five, man!
Leaving me hanging!
You know what?
You were right.
This isn't weird at all.
No, it isn't.
Are they out of rosÃ©?
You know what?
This is an old bartending trick, Jess.
Put your glass out.
You go like this No way.
Look at that.
You got some rosÃ©.
You're a genius.
I think I'm smarter at sea.
You look, you look like you belong here.
What's that, on a ship?
Yeah, you, too.
Oh, yo!
Yo!
Yo-yo-yo!
Yo, pal.
Yo.
Well, that was a mistake.
Yes, it was!
That was not on purpose.
- My fault, too.
- Yep.
Yeah, it was We can't do the grand romance package anymore.
- I agree.
We should - No.
It's too much.
It's too intense.
- They whip you into this sexual frenzy.
- I know.
- It's weird.
- I just feel like Yeah, 'cause everything's fine.
You know, I feel like a cruise tonight.
- It's not, like, a really big deal.
- I feel like We're good.
Everything's good.
Yeah, no problem, no problem.
- All right, bye, dude.
- Bye.
Jess, I've been looking all over for you.
I was hoping that as a group, we could do a little night fishing that I already put a deposit down on, so we're going.
And if we don't catch anything, they'll let us shoot a machine gun directly into the water.
That is international waters for you, baby.
I would really love nothing more than to go out there and shoot a bunch of fish in the face with you, but I think that's more of a Nick thing.
And yesterday, we decided it would be better for everyone if we just spent the rest of the time apart.
What?
I'm really sorry.
I wanted this to be a great vacation for you guys.
But look, we split up the ship: I took starboard, he took the other one.
I got the starboard and she got the other side.
What are you doing, man?
You're hanging out by an exhaust vent.
It keeps the left side of my face warm and it sounds like the ocean.
More than the ocean sounds like the ocean?
Come on, Nick.
You guys can't be separate the whole trip.
The trip just made it clear.
The breakup's too hard.
I don't think we can be friends for a while.
What?
You're not gonna be friends with Jess?
And even you guys said it.
It's just too weird.
Nick, man, that's like the president and the vice president not being best friends.
They're not best friends.
Come on.
