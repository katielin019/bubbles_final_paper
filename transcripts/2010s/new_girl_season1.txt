{START OF EPISODE 1}
So you know in horror movies when the girl's like: "Oh, my God, there's something in the basement.
Let me just run down there in my underwear and see what's going on".
And you're like, "What is your problem?
Call the police".
She's like, "Okay," but it's too late because she's getting murdered?
Well, my story's kind of like that.
It's a surprise for Spencer.
I'm gonna walk in, gonna drop my coat on the ground.
He says he had this fantasy that I'm a stripper with a heart of gold and he's helping me put myself through college.
He didn't say the college part, did he?
Um, no.
I wanted to create a three-dimensional sex character.
Really?
What's your stripper name?
Uh Rebecca Johnson.
Your stripper name's Rebecca Johnson?
Boobies Johnson.
"Two Boobs" Johnson.
Look at you, in the back of the cab, totally naked.
I am so proud of you.
Hello.
- I came home early.
- Jess.
What-- ?
Who's Jess?
You're talking to Tiger Boobs.
Oh.
Uh  I'm doing sexy things with a pillow - Just-- - She's doing sexy stuff To the plant right-- - Whoa, okay.
- I'll pick that up later Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
So that happened.
That's why I need a new apartment.
I'm sorry, what was the question again?
Do you have any pets?
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
It's Jess You know what's funny?
When I saw your ad on Craigslist, I thought you were women.
We're all Why would you think that?
That's crazy.
- I mean, what-- ?
- Schmidt wrote the ad.
Oh.
I guess it was something about the words you used.
It was like, "sun-soaked" and "beige-y".
SCHMlDT: Okay.
- What are you doing?
Wow.
SCHMlDT: Mm-hm.
What about these?
These look beige-y to you?
Sorry.
I'm his trainer, so it's kind of the house that Coach built right here.
What are we looking at?
Baby smooth.
This is LLS.
Ladies Love Schmidt.
What?
What did you just say?
Go put a dollar in the jar right now.
SCHMlDT: Are you serious?
Yeah.
- Now.
- Damn it.
LLS?
What is wrong with you?
This place is beautiful.
It gets so much light.
Spencer hated light.
- It's hard to say his name.
SCHMlDT: It's okay.
Nick knows.
He got dumped.
Dumped.
Yeah, I got dumped.
I can't hear you.
That means we're not breaking up.
- I can't hear you.
La-la-la!
- I'm breaking up with you.
Yeah, I got dumped.
She dumped me.
And I'm over it.
Okay?
It was six months ago, guys.
Get past it.
I don't even know why we're still talking about it.
Why's everybody looking at me?
You know what, I wanna live here.
Actually, I still have some questions.
No offense, you know, but we barely know you.
Yeah, okay, yeah.
So full disclosure I'm kind of emotional right now because of the breakup so I'll probably be watching Dirty Dancing at least six or seven times a day.
Um, I'm a teacher, so I bring home a lot of Popsicle sticks, stuff like that.
Also, I like to sing to myself a lot.
A lot I'm tired of living with my friend.
She's a model.
All her friends are models.
- Uh, how soon can you move in?
- Schmidt, slow up.
- Not happening.
- Okay, could you give us a second?
- I just gotta I gotta talk to my boys.
- "My boys" is not a thing.
- My bros.
- Douche-bag jar.
SCHMlDT: For what?
NlCK: For "my bros".
I'm gonna say yes.
Her friends are models.
Okay, you guys?
Models.
I say no.
I need to be able to come home from work sit on my couch and let my beans out, let them breathe.
Nick, it's all you, buddy.
First let me say, I think you guys make interesting points points I respect, but I will say this.
I have lived with a woman, Caroline and I know there are pros and I know there are real cons.
- Nick, you're weak!
- Okay, pro, they smell nice.
Cons, every once in a while, the mood changes and you're not sure why.
They'll ruin your life if you let them.
They'll break down your will to live.
- Pros, they're good at folding.
- Make a decision!
I'm sorry.
But another pro, like - Oh, don't do it.
- I'm gonna.
Put it down.
Don't hood me.
You guys don't know what you're talking about.
- I know what I'm talking about.
- Pushed him too hard.
We did.
How about this?
Executive decision.
- She's in.
Yay, I'm in.
You are not gonna regret this.
Had the time of my life No, I never felt like this before Yes, I swear it's the truth What have you done, Schmidt?
I gotta go, Mom.
No, I'm not watching Dirty Dancing.
No, I don't think so.
Are you gonna murder me because you're a stranger I met on the lnternet?
- Yes, I am.
- He says no.
No, look, I gotta go, okay?
All right, love you.
Bye.
SCHMlDT: So the Wild West party's on Saturday.
I'm trying to get us in, but you may need to call Caroline.
- I'm not calling Caroline.
Shh.
- Nick, hear me out--  Had the time of my life We are in this situation because of you.
I hate your face!
Spencer, I love you.
- lt has been a week of this madness.
- I'm going crazy, Schmidt.
I can't take it.
- Know what?
I got this.
I've been waiting for so long Hi, Coach.
Stop it.
Stop.
- Schmidt.
- Okay, all right.
I got us into this, I'm gonna get us out.
Jess, I'm gonna take the remote.
Pshew.
All right, all right.
Hey, Jess, how you doing?
You look fantastic.
Listen, what if you came out with us tonight?
You know, after work.
We'll fix you up, we'll take you out, we'll get you a rebound.
- A rebound?
- Yeah.
I don't know if I'm ready.
You're totally ready.
I'll take you through the whole thing.
You know, I'll be like your guide.
Like Gandalf through Middle-earth?
Probably not like-- Okay.
First of all, let's take the Lord of the Rings references Iet's put them in a deep, dark cave where no one's gonna find them, ever.
Except Sméagol.
He lives in a cave.
You know what, Jess, come on.
Let's just take the head off the couch.
Come on.
Sit up, girl.
There you go.
Look at that.
Doesn't that feel good?
There we go.
I think that sounds nice.
She's going out to find a rebound Who's that girl?
It's Jess Wait, did you just make up a theme song for yourself?
I'm gonna fix it.
I'm not calling my ex-girlfriend to get you into a party.
This party is everything to me.
Please, Nick.
We go every year.
You have no idea what I'm going through at work.
I'm trying to do my work.
I'm trying to do a good job here.
Nice tie.
Can I borrow a tampon?
- Schmidt, I'm not calling her.
- Listen to me.
Knowing that I will be going to the Wild Wild West Charity Auction for Poverty reminds me that I'm still a man and I can still motorboat a hot girl who is also a member of the Cherokee Nation which is not racist, because it is for a good cause.
Somebody's in here.
- We're leaving in 10.
You shave your legs?
I will now.
- Front and backs?
Yes.
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Call Caroline.
- You call her when you're drunk.
- Don't know to what you are referring.
Hello, Caroline.
I still love you.
So much.
So much.
I'm not calling her.
Schmidt, I know you really wanna go to this party but wouldn't it be better to find a girl who you really care about to motorboat?
Then maybe, if you're super-lucky you might find a girl who'll motorboat you right back.
I don't think she knows what motorboating is.
SCHMlDT: Jess, we are leaving in five.
- Hey.
Hey, Coach, what's-- ?
Oh!
Sorry.
Uh, my boss says that I don't know how to talk to women, which is ridiculous.
Spin, woman!
Spin!
Aah!
- I am spinning!
- Go!
- You're so mean!
- I'm not mean, I'm trying to help you!
I'm trying to help you!
So I was wondering if you could help me out with that.
Sure, sure, absolutely.
Um Well, first of all, maybe think about what women like to talk about.
- You know, like use me for practice.
- All right.
Um, ahem.
Shopping.
Is that fun for you guys?
Yeah.
Shopping's fun.
Uh, the other day, I bought a pair of jeggings.
They look like jeans, but they're really leggings.

A couple things you could work on.
Uh One, lowering your voice.

Beers and a rosé.
Pink wine makes me slutty.

Real bad.
Like a make-out sesh, no tops.
Okay, this is what-- This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna go over there and you're gonna stand next to him and you're gonna smile.
You're not gonna smile like that.
You look like a hungry badger.
- Stop that.

Make it stop!
Just a slob like one of us Look at us.
Couple of losers.
We both got dumped.
Jeesh.
I'm fine.
Six months ago, so Do you know why she dumped you?
She must have hurt you bad.
It made no difference to me.
I wanted to set her trash on fire.
So you were always just, like, wondering, like, "What was it?
Was there something I could have done differently"?
You know what happens to people who keep it all inside?
They get old, and they get sad, and they get weird.
Then you're the old man yelling at the kids running across your yard.
And you're telling them, "Don't run across my yard.
My life's filled with regret".
You know, you can't just pretend like it didn't happen.
Or I could pretend to be more like you, Jess and live on a sparkly rainbow and drive a unicorn around and just sing all the time.
Yeah, I think you should sing all the time.
No, I was being mean.
I'm not gonna do that.
Why not?
It's fun.
Because I have a penis.
My name is Nick I have a penis And I'm not gonna let any feelings out Okay, Jess, your left boob is resting on a plate of chicken wings.
Yeah.
I know.
Hey.
I'm Peter.
- What are you drinking?
Oh, I'll have another pink wine.
I like your glasses.
They help me see.
- She's doing all right.
- Mm-hm.
Schmidt stain.
Hey, man, I was thinking, it's probably better that you don't come to the party.
That means more breasts for me.
Ha-ha-ha.

You're taking this too far.
I'm ser-- Hold me back, Coach.
I'm ser-- Hold me back.

I said he was drunk at the bar and now he's passed out.
Hi, Winston.
Hey, I apologize for what happened before.
Not cool, bad call.
I've been talking to the guys about boundaries, so I totally get it.
Perfectly fine, no problem.
You have a tank top I could borrow?
You look like you're about my size.
I'm really low on clothes because I broke up with my boyfriend.
- Oh, God.
- I caught him cheating.
- And I just grabbed whatever I could and-- SCHMlDT: You know what?
Check my lost and found.
It's where I keep stuff girls leave behind in my room after we fornicate.
Got sizes zero through ten.

You have made love to a lot of forgetful women.

I kind of took it from him when he left.
I used to be in the small room.
This happened in the small room, twice.
Never going back there again, Jess.
- He's never gonna give you that room back.
- Psh.
Come on, it's Schmidt.
You know, they have a saying in Latvia: "That guy is so stupid, we could easily take things away from him".
- That's a saying?
- Yeah, it is.
NlCK: Weird saying.
Oh!
What do you think?
I've been telling you this for weeks, but you gotta call Spencer and you gotta get your stuff back, unless-- You know, unless you're scared.
No, I am not scared.
It's just complicated.
That stuff was That stuff was ours and I miss him-- Jess, look, it's a ball.

I'll get you a new one.

You don't know me like that, but I need a TV.
- Do you have a TV at Spencer's?
- Yeah, I do.
- It's just really big and thin and bright.
- Go get it.
No, I can't call Spencer I haven't talked to him since he cheated on me with that ho.
Actually, that's not fair.
She might be a really nice ho.
I just don't wanna fight with Spencer.
I wanna be friends eventually.
Why do you wanna be friends with your ex?
I don't wanna be friends with Caroline, and all she did was rip me open and tear out my heart with her perfect, perfect hands.
He has a power over me.
It's like he's a wizard and I'm his mage.
I think it's his hair.
He has this, like, really beautiful hair and whenever I see it, I get the whoo-whoos.

All I can say Is that my life is pretty plain Hi, Jess-Jess.
Wow, I missed this place.
Mm, mm.
- How's your yogurt thing, Schmidt?
- Oh, the parfait?
It's parfait.
- Come on.
Don't.
- Oh, hello, you look beautiful today.
- And smart.
- Stop talking to me, Schmidt.
- So you're making all the calls now.
- Sure.
- This must mean you are the top dog.
- Yeah?
Absolutely.
You know, I'm glad you guys think that, because, you know, I think that too.
One hundred percent.
When I moved out, obviously there was a power vacuum.
SCHMlDT: Mm-hm.
- Yeah, I needed a leader.
I didn't know which end was up.
No, Nick's a bottom.
You know what I mean.
Absolutely.
Say, Winston, do all top dogs need the biggest room or I don't know, is that kind of cheesy?
Is it overkill?
No, but I definitely see what you're saying though, definitely.
Every top dog is different, every top dog is different.
Hey, Schmidt, what kind of top dog are you?
The kind with the big room.
I'm so glad we're talking.
Last time I saw you, you were so mad.
- How's, um?
- Rochelle.
- Rochelle.
Fancy name.
- She's great.
- Rochelle, like a mermaid.
- Yeah.
Hello, I'm Rochelle.
I eat fish.
Yeah, we have a lot in common.
Obviously we both love bikes.
- I love bikes.
- Not enough.
Um Spencer, I need my stuff back.
My TV and all my winter clothes - and my plants.
- Of course.
I would have brought it today but I rode my bike here, you know, without the basket.
When would be a good time for me to come-- ?
- It's so good to see you.
Shh.
- Spencer, I really need my-- I need something too.
This here's a jam for all the fellas Thanks for taking me to the airport, Jess.
Of course.
All you have is your bike, Rochelle.
You want it, you got it You want it - Baby, you got it - Baby Just bust a move SPENCER &  You want it Five-fifty for the TV?
Seems a little steep.
I'm gonna write down a figure and this is as high as I'll go.
You drew a smiley face.
I'm a teacher.
Do it for the kids.
For the kids, 550.
I can't go home without a TV.
I thought pawnshops were about helping people.
And frankly, right now I feel taken advantage of.
And I just got out of a long relationship and I don't know what I'm doing emotionally or, let's be honest, sexually.
I'll just get out of here.
Are you trying to rob me?
- Hey, where's Winston at, man?
- I think he's in his room, Schmidt.
You really think I'm top dog?
- Yes.
- You think I'm head baller, shot caller?
Yes, Schmidt, I feel that way.
See that, man?
That's my new thumb ring.
How choice is that?
Little skull.
It's so nectar.
- Did you just make up "nectar"?
- No, it's a volleyball term.
What is Winston doing there?
He can't hang out in there.
It's too small.
NlCK: What's up?
SCHMlDT: Yo, what up, Cece?
- Hey, are you all right?
- I'm sorry, I didn't get the TV.
- What happened?
- Ugh.
I'm a terrible roommate.
You guys told her to call Spencer?
That is not your job.
- That is my job.
- All right, so, what happened?
- He needed a ride to the airport.
- What?
- For his new girlfriend.
NlCK: Are you kidding me?
I'm supposed to pick her up next Sunday.
- Oh, my God, Jess.
- What's wrong with me?
I figured it out.
This guy's your kryptonite.
You need to stand up and you need to fight him.
I tried to fight him, but I can't, because I'm powerless.
You're not ready to let him go.
I think you know deep down, once you get your stuff back you know, it's "over" over.
I can't believe I'm actually gonna say this, but I agree with him.
No, you guys are wrong.
I really wanna move on.
- You gotta fight.
- All right, I wanna fight.
- And get mad.
- I wanna get mad.
All right, then do this.
Pretend this is Spencer's face.
Punch it.
Get him.
Go on, do it again.
Punch it like a man.
- Harder than that.
Come on, Jess.
- Come on Jess, you're angry.
Good.
Get angry.
Real angry.
NlCK: That's dancing.
That's punch dancing.
He broke your heart.
He did terrible things to you.
I'm mad!
NlCK: Good.
There you go.
- I'm bad!
- You're ready.
Get your stuff.
I'm gonna get my stuff!
- Go get it!
- Come on, Jess.
- I'm really mad!
Gonna go get it!
- Get your stuff!
I'm gonna face the facts.
I'm gonna ask you guys right now to come with me.
Seriously, guys.
Because I can't carry everything alone, and I can't be alone.
Yeah!
Loud music!
Loud.
It's loud.
- You are ruining my pre-game mix.
- What am I gonna say?
- Hey, Spencer, give me my TV back.
- Hi, Spencer.
- Give me my TV back, buddy.
- Hey, No "buddy".
- How about "jerk" or "idiot"?
- Mr. Crabs.
- Mr. Crabs is an option.
- Your hand is on my leg.
- Oh, your hand's on my leg.
- No, it really isn't.
Classic he said, she said.
Okay, Jess, just pull over right here.
Whoa!
NlCK: Come on.
What are you doing?
Okay, you know what?
Just one more shot.
One more time around, Jess, and then we're good.
You got this.
- Good.
SCHMlDT: Here we go.
- All right, you got this, Jess.
NlCK: Come on.
Come on.
Just one more time.
Gonna  NlCK: This is the time.
This is the time.
WlNSTON: This is the one.
One more shot.
One more shot.
Just one more.
Just one more.
- You know, I'm on to you.
- What do you mean?
Okay, you told me that I'm top dog but secretly, you think you're top dog, all right?
Now you're just trying to out-top-dog the top dog.
Can you take these doors off child-lock - so I can kill myself?
- Men working.
Things are different now, man, all right?
You're not top dog anymore.
I am.
You know what?
You are absolutely correct.
You are the top dog.
Here.
What are you doing?
There's no top dog crown.
Are you trying to make me look stupid?
Look, man, this is about respect.
I'm a lot flyer than I used to be.
- Yeah, much flyer.
I respect you.
- No, you don't.
Because if you did, you would have told me that the small room is the top dog room.
Face to face  Just when  Just when you thought Our chance had past What?
I own this song.
You go and save the best for last  Oh!
What's happening?
What's happening is that this is a great song.
I'll be out here if you need me, Jess.
Jess-Jess.
That's the wizard?
He's wearing a scrunchie.
WlNSTON: Looks like he juggles clubs on the beach.
Yeah, like he'd ever have a job.
Didn't you just kind of assume he'd have a handlebar mustache?
Come on, Jess, just go in there and get that TV.
- I miss you, Jess.
Don't hug him back.
Ugh.
- Ugh.
SCHMlDT: Oh, that's not healthy.
- I told you to water the plants.
- Huh?
Oh.
Oh, you know it's not my thing.
I told you to water the plants.
NlCK: Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
NlCK: What is she doing?
Oh!
- Oh, what a mess.
I'm coming in!
Jess, take your shoes off!
We keep an Asian household.
Didn't see that coming.
What are you doing?
- She gonna be okay in there?
Put that down!
No, come on, come on!
Jess, wait!
Let's just talk about this, okay?
Hold on.
No, that's mine.
You can't take that!
Jess, hold up.
What are you doing?
I got it!
It's really heavy, but I got it!
Oh, my God, we created a monster.
NlCK: She looks like Helena Bonham Carter.
SCHMlDT: Oh, gosh.
- Soft hands, Jess.
- Jess, come on, let's share it.
- You know, work out a system.
- Hey.
Hey, that's my shirt.
- No, this is my T-shirt.
- That is my shirt.
It has my name on it.
- Don't drop it.
Jess, don't  Come on, everybody out now.
Give me my shirt!
I like this shirt.
Hey, Jess, no, no, no, stop.
- Don't mind us.
We're just here for the TV.
Who are these guys?
- They're my roommates.
- Cece, hi.
I'm gonna go in and get the rest of your stuff, Jess.
Wait, let's just talk about this, okay?
You know, rap it out.
We can't rap it out.
We're not together.
It's not the same.
- Doesn't mean we can't talk.
- Nothing to talk about.
Give me my shirt back.
No, you gave this to me.
I wanna keep it.
- Give her her T-shirt, man.
- No, I don't want to.
And I gave her this hat.
I'm gonna take this back.
- This one?
You want that?
- Yeah.
Then I dare you, come take it off my head, pal.
I dare you.
- You guys look ridiculous.
- Look, give her the shirt back.
- I bet she worked hard on that jamboree.
Yeah, play on words.
- Jamboree.
Jam.
- Jam.
Girl made a lot of jam, Spence.
You know how time-consuming that can be?
You need a jar funnel, a canner, some fresh fruit strawberries, raspberries, maybe a tayberry, maybe a ripe-- - No more fruit.
- You live with these people, Jess?
Seriously?
Stay here until you find a better place to live.
I don't like you, stretch.
I don't like anything about you.
- And I'm not afraid to-- - I got this.
I've got a place to live, Spence.
It's over.
I spent six years trying to figure you out.
All you are is a guy with really beautiful hair.
I'm happy you cheated on me.
Thank you, because if you hadn't, I would have married you.
And then you would have hurt me all over again.
And, yeah, I was scared to start over.
I didn't know what to do.
And, yeah, I'm living with three guys I met on the lnternet.
And, yeah, stranger danger is real.
But I love these guys.
I barely know them, I just met him, but I love them.
NlCK: I would just take it easy with the love stuff.
All of them.
Give her the shirt back, man.
- What happens if I say no?
- You know what happens?
Schmidt happens.
- Aah!
What was on your hand?
- Thumb ring, bitch!
You got some Schmidt on your face.
You know what?
Fine.
Here.
Take it.
- Keep the bell.
- What?
I thought we were gonna handle this like adults, Jess.
Yeah, well, I thought you were the love of my life, so Suck it, Mr. Crabs.
- You hit that guy.
- Whatevs.
You know.
You know what?
Maybe I didn't have respect for you before because if this is what respecting you feels like this is definitely not how I felt.
So you recognize.
Represent, what?
Okay, look, I'm gonna be completely honest.
I've been messing with you.
It's just that I wanted my old room back.
You know, you're right.
I've been away a long time and things have changed here.
So I guess I kind of gotta get used to that.
You can keep the big room.
See, now you're just deep dogging me, man.
I'm not scared of your mind games.
I'm taking the small room, Winston.
- Schmidt, that's not what I mean-- - No.
Listen to what I mean.
You can double reverse dog me until the cows come home.
I'm not falling for it.
What do you take me for, some kind of idiot?
Yes.
- Can't believe I got all my stuff back.
- You did, but most of it's broken.
Yeah, it's broken, but, I don't know, it's mine.
Yeah, but it's broken.
Hey, look at that.
I think it's working.
- Oh, my God!
- We got a TV again.
- It's a TV and it's working!
NlCK: Hey, we got the TV back!
All right.
You guys are awesome.
I'm gonna make you so much jam.
- Please, don't.
- Oh, we're gonna have a jam sess.
Absolutely not.
- Okay, what are we watching?
- I have some DVDs.
Adventures in Babysitting, Prancer, Newsies, Curly Sue.
- I'm going out.
- Yeah.
Wait.
Where are you guys going?
These are heartwarming films.
- Curly Sue.
Let's do this.
- All right, let me go get it.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
It's our first wedding together, so we need nicknames.
Nick is Knickknack, or Mr. Suspenders.
No nicknames.
Your only job tonight is to be Nick's girlfriend.
And make sure he stays out of trouble with Caroline.
- Why can't you and Winston help?
SCHMlDT: We've tried.
He doesn't listen to us anymore.
She's not coming back.
He's right.
I don't.
- No.
- That is the ugliest dress I have ever seen, Jess.
I'm gonna need you to step it up tonight.
When I see you, I want to be thinking: "Who let the dirty slut out of the slut house"?
Probably the slut butler, right?
Yo, let's go.
We can't be late.
I am in the wedding.
- You're the usher, relax.
- Yeah, I'll be busy.
I won't have to sit around answering stupid questions.
Like, "Do you have a job?
Are you still playing basketball"?
Does it look like I'm still playing overseas basketball?
- What's the matter?
- This is the first job I've had in months.
I want to get in there and ush this wedding in the face.
You're gonna be great, man.
So when we do the chicken dance, I do it differently.
I know that it usually goes like:  But instead of doing claps, I like to do a peck.
Because it's more realistic.
No chicken dance.
Look, we're not trying to be mean.
We just don't want you to be yourself.
In any way.
Okay.
Suppress the Jess.
Got it.
- Did you use my hair gel?
- Did I use your hair gel?
I won't be mad.
Just let me know if you did.
- No.
- You sure?
- I used your hair gel.
- Are you serious?
NlCK: Yeah.
It's-- Who let the dirty slut out of the slut house?
NlCK: Wow.
You look great.
Let's go knock biscuits, brother-cousins.
- No.
- No teeth, Jess.
- You can't use prop teeth.
JESS : Come on, guys.
These are hilarious.
Kids love these.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- It's Jess   Want to know one of my beauty secrets?
The only way I could fit in this dress was by wearing little girls' bicycle shorts underneath.
They are tight.
I will not be peeing tonight.
Oh, my God, bubbles.
No, no, Jess.
No bubbles, no bubbles, please.
Ooh, a lot of big game here tonight.
Ooh.
SCHMlDT: Oh, there's Brooke.
Who's Brooke?
- He's been into her since freshman year.
She used to pass out drunk on our porch.
Like having a hot, alcoholic cat.
I'd always leave water out for her.
Okay.
Tonight just got real.
She goes on the kill list.
Because you're gonna attempt to kill her by having sex with her?
- More or less.
- Oh, Schmidt.
One day you're gonna kill the nicest girl.
Look at my new boyfriend.
So fancy in his big-boy tie.
Jess, would you please stop?
What is it with Caroline?
You're a different person.
Just focus on getting through today, please.
Okay, Mr. Boy T. Friend.
- What did I tell you?
- Don't be myself.
- Yes.
- I love that about our relationship.
You never let me be myself.
Hey.
- Winston.
WlNSTON: Hey.
- You're back.
- Yeah.
What are you up to?
Where you working at?
Here.
As an usher.
Hi.
What a beautiful dress.
I'm surprised you noticed the dress.
I was distracted by the woman inside.
- Jimmy Longjam, alternate usher.
- Alternate usher.
- I mean, I'm here.
I'm the usher.
- You were late.
It's called commitment.
- Look it up in a typewriter, old man.
- What?
- How much do you make?
- Where is your mom?
Can somebody help me?
- Bride or groom?
Thank you.
Oh, no.
No, not tonight.
No.
- Who is that?
- Gretchen.
She's a terrible person.
We can't stand each other.
At every wedding, we end up-- We end up having sex.
I mean, look, the sex is amazing.
- She's coming over.
- There are those people.
Oh, what people?
- Hello, Gretchen.
Mm-hm.
- I see you wore the pantsuit again.
- This is a new one.
It's got way more stretch in the pants.
- That's horrible.
- Ready for tonight?
I'm gonna tie you down and show you pictures of my river rafting trip.
- Oh, God, how many are there?
- It's a two-hour slideshow.
No, Gretchen.
We can't do this anymore, okay?
It's not-- It's not healthy.
All right?
Please, no more.
There she is.
There she is.
She's right over there.
She's right over here.
She's right-- - Just be cool.
Okay, okay.
- Hi.
- Hey, Caroline, wow.
I didn't know you'd be here.
Great to see you.
Nicholas, you have to introduce me.
Yeah, of course.
Jess, this is Caroline.
- Hi.
- One more time.
Cara-lee?
- Caroline.
- Caraloo?
Coraline?
Caroline.
Okay.
Fancy.
Well, I'm Nicholas' girlfriend.
We just started dating, so we're still in that honeymoon phase.
Heh-heh.
I barely sleep.
So much doing it.
NlCK: So much doing it.
It's crazy.
He's so soft, like a towel.
Well, it was nice to meet you.
So nice to meet you too, Carol.
- Caroline.
- I give up.
I guess I'll see you later.
For sure, for sure.
Oh, my God.
Was she jealous?
I think she was jealous.
You did so good.
That was remarkable.
I just done what my mama learnt me.
Give me the teeth.
I catch a paper boy But things don't really change I'm standing in the wind Brooke.
Hi.
Wow.
Schmidt.
You used to borrow my poncho freshman year.
Remember that?
No?
Fat Schmidt?
Fat Schmidt.
Of course.
Wow, you look great.
You also, for sure.
Um How are your classes?
I mean, not that we're in school anymore.
I know that.
- What are you drinking?
White wine?
- I'm not drinking.
I'm sober, six months.
- Can I get a seltzer, please?
- Me too.
- You're six months sober also?
- Seven months.
One more.
- Wow, that's great.
Congratulations.
- Here's your white wine.
What?
What?
That's a mistake.
No, I didn't order that.
No.
No, sir.
- Even the-- Even smell of it.
- I'm gonna run back to my table.
But you can come talk to me if you need to.
SCHMlDT: Okay, thank you.
So, what I need you to do is this.
I need you to put vodka in a water bottle.
Then rendezvous with me in the restroom, okay?
Same page?
Same page?
This kid is pushing my buttons.
Winston, he's just a little boy.
Relax.
If Brooke asks, I'm clean and sober and looking to settle down.
Great.
Schmidt's sober.
What are you doing?
She's looking at us.
- Your head is shaped like a yam.
- Yeah, I know.
I can't wear soft hats.
Uh-huh.
I want to talk to her by myself.
- No.
Are you sure?
- Jess, I'm fine, for real.
Hi.
Could that ceremony have lasted any longer?
Ha, ha, ha.
We loved it.
Taking notes in case Mr. Commitment-Phobe over here decides to make an honest woman out of me.
Hey, Jess, did you want to go do that thing from?
- Yes, I did.
I want to do it very badly.
Yup.
- Thank you.
And now for the first time ever, Mr. and Mrs. Handelman-Pyong.
Yeah!
Bride and groom!
Make way!
Huzzah!
Celebrate love!
Get ready for a wonderful life of merriment and joy!
Jess is - great.
- The best.
Yeah, so happy.
Are you guys pretty serious, or?
Yeah, we are pretty serious.
Yeah, we live together.
I mean, different bedrooms, but shared bathroom, so that's something.
Alcohol.
Any kind of alcohol you have.
Just give me anything.
- Thanks.
Give me that.
Oh, God.
It's like you're lapping it out of a puddle.
You get those boots off a lady hiker?
Look at those earrings.
Are they clip-ons?
I'm gonna make you wear them.
- Huh.
No.
- No?
- ls it bad that I can't feel my legs?
- Yes.
Now let's talk about my problems.
I have to go home with Brooke tonight.
I deserve someone like Brooke.
She's perfect.
And it doesn't matter that I have gymnastic mean-spirited, highly educational sex with Gretchen.
That's not what I want to do anymore.
Not tonight.
What's so bad about liking Gretchen?
You obviously have a weird connection.
No, no, I want to connect with Brooke.
I want to connect in the shower, on the floor.
You know what?
- Sitting lndian style.
I'm going to put my hands over my ears.
- We got a problem.
SCHMlDT: What?
Jess, what did you do?
- What?
They're fine.
They're just talking.
WlNSTON: No, no, no.
With Caroline, he is not fine.
He ran into her at a party months ago, then sent me a 10-page e-mail about what she meant when she said, "I'll see you soon".
She will flirt with him until she knows she can have him.
- It's like he's her backup plan.
- I didn't know that.
You want to live with Nick when he's not showering and crying all day?
Yeah, he just sounds like this: Unh, wah-hah.
Ever heard a man sob and listen to Simon & Garfunkel?
- Yeah, my dad.
- Yeah.
Okay, I get it, I'll go, but I just-- - These bicycle shorts are really tight.
SCHMlDT: Come on.
- Work through it, woman.
- Okay, okay.
Okay.
It's all on you, Jess.
Come on in, honey.
- The water's fine.
- Jess, you know I don't dance.
Oh, but you didn't know that I did this: I'm mime-walking.
I'm Mime-chael Jackson.
CAROLlNE: I'll get a drink.
- Me too.
- Nick, wait, no.
- Jess, relax, this is good.
I may actually have a chance, and it's all because of you, so thank you.
No, Nick, that wasn't my intention.
Nick.
Oh, hi.
I don't feel like dancing right now.
I'm sorry.
Well, do you, do you, do you wanna?
Wanna go?
I'm really uncomfortable right now.
- Oh, Winston, thank God.
Nick got away.
- Nick can wait.
This-- This is about honor.
He's a friend and I knew him before you And it looks like we have a dance-off.
What?
- Oh, my God, what are you doing?
- Mommy?
Mommy?
Nick?
Nick?
A chocolate fountain.
Reminds me of the one in Tuscany.
You ever been?
Yeah.
I was just there for New Year's.
Where's the chocolate fountain?
I don't know, never been.
I'm fascinated with the culture.
Schmidt!
Schmidt, I need you to help me get these off so I can go find Nick!
God, are you friends with that girl?
- Schmidt!
- Okay, look, l-- I didn't want to have to tell you this but she was a mistake I made when I hit rock-bottom.
Like I was Sid and she was Nancy.
Then I got sober and she couldn't deal with it.
And the poor thing just went-- She went crazy.
Schmidt, I need you to come help me slap my thighs around!
I don't want to scare you, but she can be really dangerous when she drinks.
I shouldn't even be in the same room with her, it's just-- It feels so good talking to you.
- Maybe we should get you out of here.
- What a great idea.
Yes.
I just have to go to the bathroom quickly.
Whatever you need.
Whatever-- Of course.
Ready?
No lips.
- Name one, name one.
- Do, uh, wind tunnel.
Super high driver's license.
Can we stay in here all night?
Oh, hi.
Schmidt is very fond of you.
Um, look, I don't-- I don't even really know him that well, okay?
Oh, I'm just cutting off my underwear.
You know.
Girl stuff.
So tight.
Well, it's been really nice chatting with you but I've got a pretend boyfriend to hunt down.
- I think he's cheating on me.
- Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, and don't break Schmidt's heart, or you'll have me to deal with.
NlCK: This is fun.
CAROLlNE: Ha, ha, ha.
Aha!
- I trusted you!
NlCK: Jess, get out of here.
- Nothing happened.
- After everything we built.
- Go away, Jess.
- Who are you?
No, really, nothing happened.
I have a boyfriend.
- Wait, you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, well, I've been seeing someone.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
- But now I know that you have Jess-- - Yeah, he has me.
And our baby.
Okay, I'm just gonna let you guys-- And our other baby!
- Jess, what happened with Brooke?
What?
She left here in tears because she said you threatened her with a knife.
No, I was talking you up.
You shouldn't have.
You should have been taking care of Nick.
Why is it so hard to do one thing?
- How is this my fault?
- Ruiner.
Did you just call me a ruiner?
- Yeah.
- Okay, you know what?
Forget it.
I'm not helping you guys anymore.
Give me my teeth back.
- Stop.
- You don't appreciate them.
- Cool it.
- Give them back.
I'm gonna have fun, because there's nothing wrong with who I am and I like having fun at weddings.
And I like dancing.
And if you don't like that, then tough Tater Tots, tooter.
Jess is back.
You're going home with me, aren't you?
Lose control Get drunk because I'm a freak Good boy.
I rock it up every night Would you party with me?
That's Caroline and that's me.
Four years.
Four years together, so It doesn't matter to me.
It's just what matters is respect.
I'm just so alone right now, man.
- lt is a real bad situation.
- Steve and Bree, babe.
Steve and Bree.
Because that's what this is about.
I agree.
You're good at your job, babe.
I'm so happy for you two.
You look great.
It feels a little bit like you're rubbing your happiness in my face but let's be honest, Bree, this doesn't look great on you.
This.
That's not a great look, Bree.
Congratulations, Steve.
Nice fedora.
And no open bar, Steve?
Don't you understand that's tacky?
Your dad's rich, you're a lawyer, man.
Yeah.
That happened.
The photo booth is a liar, FYl.
Oh, hey, ladies.
You guys want to see a grown man cry?
No?
Then get out!
I think I saw a single doctor looking at you.
This is gonna take a while, Orange.
Hey, there, partner.
Chances are Hey, can I tell you something you promise to never tell Schmidt?
I love bubbles.
I don't know why, I just always have.
Heh, heh, heh.
You see that?
That was like two in one.
You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Those guys were jerks.
But I know they're glad you're around.
- Really?
- Yeah.
They're not just gonna come out and say it.
Especially Nick.
You know, but they're all thinking it.
Even me.
Most of the time.
It was weird when I was stuck in a freak sandwich between you and that 8-year-old.
Do you want to talk about that?
Heh.
You know, it's just that he got to be a bit annoying so I kind of took my feelings out with dance.
Okay, so we have a situation.
NlCK: They want me to leave the booth, you clowns, but I'm not gonna leave.
- Hey, Nick.
How you doing, buddy?
- They want me to leave the booth.
But I'm staying.
This is my home now.
It's got everything that I need.
You can see by looking at these pictures he's experiencing a variety of different emotions.
This one is-- Well, that's actually his butt.
- He just keeps saying "Jess".
NlCK: Jess.
The fact is that I was a mean person and I'm sorry, okay?
- Hi, Nicholas.
- Hey, Jess, I live in a photo booth now.
- Oh, is that so?
- Yep.
Come on in, come on in.
- That's the kitchen.
- Very nice.
- This is the common area.
- Okay.
Dining room, living room, everything.
It's very nice.
Hey.
- She has a boyfriend.
- Yeah.
She shouldn't have been flirting with you all night.
You can't be her backup plan.
You have to let each other go.
So now you have to make a decision.
Am I gonna stay locked in a photo booth for the next hour or am I gonna get out there, take my shoes off and dance my face off?
Come on, it's up to you.
Oh, man.
All right.
I love you, photo booth.
Yo, look at him.
He looks better.
I can't do this anymore.
I have to let you go, Caroline, for real.
It has to be over.
Goodbye.
Good luck and everything.
Goodbye.
All right, I've got to-- Excuse me.
When I'm feeling blue - Come on, Jess.
- What?
Just please, just come with me right now.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Then I'm not so blue When you're close to me I can feel your heartbeat I can hear you breathing In my ear Wouldn't you agree?
Baby, you and me Got a groovy kind of love That looks like so much fun.
Any time you want to You can turn me on to Anything you want to Okay.
Any time at all When I kiss your lips Ooh, I start to shiver Can 't control the quivering inside Wouldn 't you agree?
Baby, you and me Got a groovy kind of love Check out my beaks.
Stop copying my beaks.
Gretchen, you think that, like, hooking up at all these weddings one of these times, we can go on an actual date?
No.
I'm just using you for your body.
Oh.
Okay.
Cool.
- How many more of these things?
- We're just getting started.
That yellow helmet is-- Ugh.
Tonight I'm gonna get certified on the River Schmidt.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Ooh.
Scary movie.
I hate scary movies.
Why are we watching this?
We're not watching this, Jess.
We're watching it.
So fun, hanging with the dudes eating ice cream, watching scary movies.
We're not scared.
We're dudes.
Shh.
You know what we should watch?
Have you guys ever seen Fame?
It's about a group of dreamers with talent to spare taking New York City by storm, one dance number at a time.
The cafeteria, the street-- Oh!
Ugh.
Oh, God.
That's so much blood spurting.
Mm.
So good.
That guy's gonna blow himself up.
Wah, wah.
Why would that guy blow himself up?
Sorry.
I saw it in the theater.
You know what else we should watch?
An American Tail.
It's about a little Jewish mouse with a great big heart-- WlNSTON: All right.

Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess - You know where you're taking her?
- No.
Need a list of my sexiest date spots?
It's been a while for you.
- Want me to stretch you out?
- It's not a date, Schmidt.
Actually, I don't know what it is.
She's, uh-- She's a little hard to read.
Wouldn't it be funny if we, like, went out?
Like - Do you want to go on a date?
- Yeah.
We'd, like, "go for dinner," and, like, the two of us would, like, do stuff.
- ls that a yes?
- I know, right?
- You wanna get dinner?
- I know.
Sometimes she's so ironic that I think she's being serious.
I get it.
Led Zeppelin is classic, but it's no, like, Steve Miller Band.
Heh, Steve Miller Band?
"The Joker"?
Ha.
Oh, yeah.
No, I love the Steve Miller Band.
Look, you've been out of the game for a while.

- Ah.
How'd the job interview go?
- You know, terrible.
Did you see the JWOWW retweet of the Gaga TwitPic?
I know Word.
And I can open a document save it, save as, print, print preview.
She wanted to chitchat about stuff I've never heard of.
You gotta get up to speed, man.
The chitchat is the interview.
I've spent the last two years of my life in Latvia.
I was playing ball.
I didn't read the news!
I have no idea what happened.
I've got interviews tomorrow.
What'd I miss?
- From the past two years?
- Give me the highlights.
Highli-- Okay.
Uh, country's broke.
Mm-hm.
- Betty White's back.

Hey, Nick, can you turn down that music?
- Hey, Nick, can you-- ?
- What?
What are you-- ?
Oh, my God!
Look at you.
You're like an animal.
- Uh, what are you watching now?
- The King's Speech and Human Centipede.
Next up: Precious and "David After Dentist".
- You're doing a good job.
- Okay, test me.
Hit me with the chitchat.
Ask me anything.
Chitchat.
Let's go.
- You gotta-- - Let's go!
What you waiting for?
- You're getting intense.
- You're intense.
- I think you need to bring it down.
Ahem.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Something's happened.
It was totally an accident.
Not a big deal.
I just want to do the mature thing and come clean about it.
But, um, I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee.
- What?
- What'd she say?
I accidentally saw Nick's pee-pee and his bubbles.
But it's not a big deal.
Ain't no thing.
Ain't no thing.
- Oh, Nick, hey.
- Hey.
- So that was weird, right?
- I'm running out the door, Jess.
- I think we should talk about it.
- Talk about what?
About me seeing your peen.
The peen what I saw.
Bonjour, le peen.
- You're blocking the door.
- Okay.
Cool.
Have fun on your date.
Tell that guy to behave.
Ha-ha-ha.
- The adventure begins.
- Okay.
Excuse me, Jess.
That was so horrible.
What am I gonna do?
He's never gonna speak to me.
I'm so embarrassed.
It's not a big deal.
I've seen Nick's stuff a million times.
You have?
I mean, how?
We grew up together.
Locker rooms, swimming pools, penis fights - it just happens.
- Why haven't I seen it?
- Why do you wanna see it?
- He's my best friend.
Again, why do you wanna see it?
What if Nick gets into an accident?
What if he's horribly disfigured and I have to identify him, and all that remains are his private parts?
And I'm standing there and I'm saying, "Sorry, officer, I can't help you because, no, I haven't seen his penis".
And then, boom, he's buried in an unmarked grave.
- Again, why do you wanna see it?
- What did it look like?
- What do you mean?
- Just say when.
Serious-- Seriously?
Are you ser-- ?
Are you serious?
Okay, you know what.
This is impossible.
I'm starting over.
- Schmidt, I need your help.
- Okay, all right, ugh, all right, Jess, fine.
- What happened after you walked in?
- I don't know.
I kind of laughed.
Jess, you can't laugh at a naked man.
And especially Nick.
Nick is delicate, like a flower.
Like a chubby, damaged flower who hates himself.
Now, listen to me.
You're gonna act like this never happened.
We live together.
We're a family.
Families talk about things.
No.
Families ignore things until they go away.
Hey, Mom, hey, Mom, hey, Mom.
I'm a bunny, Mom.
Mom!
Mom, Mom, Mom.
I'm a bunny, Mom.
Mom!
No one wants to talk about their feelings, Jess.
- Never talk about this again.
- Okay.
I'll ignore it.
-  Not gonna talk about-- - Or sing about it.
The bing-bong This is my chambre.
Ha-ha-ha.
What does that mean?
Ha, ha.
Mm.
You're a good kisser.
Heh.
Heh.
Can we be serious?
- Do you mind just being serious?
- I'm gonna get serious on your face.
- Yeah, I have no idea what that means.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Actually, let's not laugh when you're near my penis.
Take it off.
Here, just take your shirt off.
Uh-- Here.
Do you want me to go first?
You're offering just to take your-- Oh, my God!
Look at you!
Take off your clothes now.
President Obama.
Yeah, I like him to watch over me.
Do you, like, wanna take it slow or something?
- This is nice.
- Yeah.
MAN : It's starting to look like a triple rainbow.
Oh, my God, it's full-on!
Hi, Nick.
So I guess your date went well.
Sleepover party.
I have something from school that, um, made me think of you.
It's a feeling stick.
Whoever's holding the feeling stick has permission to say whatever he or she is feeling without being judged.
I'll go first.
Um I feel like I wanna know what you're feeling.
Believe it or not, heh that's not the first time someone's broken my feeling stick.
- I have a travel size.
- No.
Nick, wait.
Nick, we have to talk about this.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry I saw your doojer and your chickadees.
I didn't mean to laugh.
I just-- Then why did you laugh?
Is there something funny about it?
No.
It's beautiful.
Stately.
A real treat.
Oh, my God.
I think it's great you dance naked to Jamaican music.
That's really cool, you should explore your sexuality.
- Nick?
- Excuse me.
Come on, Nick.
I dance naked all the time!
We have to talk about this!
Ugh!
Nick!
- Nick, please talk to me.
- Jess, there's nothing to talk about!
You ruined my date!
Every time I tried to take my clothes off, Jess I heard your little: "Ha, ha"!
Your little crazy giggle scream.
And all I want to do is have meaningless sex with a beautiful woman who, yes, talks in mind-bending riddles.
But I can't, because I can't get your little, "Aah" out of my head.
Maybe you don't want meaningless sex!
- Maybe that's not your style!
- I have a bing-bong and chickadees.
It is my style.
- Stop following me.
- Then stop running away from me.
I just wanna have a mature conversation.
How can we have a mature conversation when you can't even say "penis"?
I can say the word pen-- - Say it.
- l  - What?
- Peernis.
You said "peernis".
Penis Not singing.
Penis.
Not like a ghoul.
l, heh-- Agh, I can say it.
- Pianist.
- No, you said "pianist".
- Enispay.
NlCK: Not pig Latin.
- Peernis.
- Okay, not in Swedish.
- Not in fake ltalian.
-  Penis!
Shut up!
- Say it with me: pe - Pe - nis.
- nyear.
Yeah, I'm the one that's immature.
- Hey, man.
- Aah!
- I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.
- What?
- Just the gun.
- No.
- Just the roses.
- What?
- Just the hub, where it connects.
- Get out.
- Fine!
I thought we were best friends.
- We are.
Apparently not.
- Best friends don't do this, Schmidt.
- They do it all the time.
- You laughed?
- Yeah, I couldn't help it.
Did you make that noise that you always make?
What?
I don't always make a noise.
Fine.
I guess I missed the moment when everybody got cool about sex.
I really messed up.
Eh.
Guys are simple.
You know what I would do?
I would just make it even.
You've seen his, show him yours.
Heh.
No.
I can't do that.
Hey, Winston.
Oh, no.
Oh, man.
The interview?
Did you mess up?
No, I didn't mess up.
Killed it.
I was amazing.
At one point, I was on the outside of my body watching myself be amazing.
- That's a good thing.
- The woman asked why I wanted to sell medical supplies.
I had no answer.
I've done nothing but play basketball my entire life.
"Winston Bishop is an American basketball player who played professionally in Latvia, and he loves ducks".
Did you write the part about the ducks?
I don't even like ducks that much.
Okay, look, man.
You gotta get off Wikipedia, all right?
You're going crazy.
I was the guy who was good enough to play in Latvia.
And then, one day, I don't know, man, I just lost it.
They found another black guy.
Heh.
- Means "the better black guy".
- A better melno?
You're the best melno.
- I don't know what comes next.
- You know what you do?
You're gonna get up.
Come on, buddy.
We're gonna get you out of the house, get you moving.
- It's gonna feel good.
WlNSTON: Whoo!
This feels good.
Totally.
I love it.
You know, I think I was just scared, man.
I've been playing basketball my whole life.
What if I was wasting my time?
I should have been figuring out my life like you.
Heh.
I don't have anything figured out.
I'm a fully-grown man with roommates.
I've got a stupid job.
I'm single.
My best friend won't even let me see his penis.
I mean, my whole life is a sham.
Agh!
- Wow, I actually feel a lot better.
- Aah.
- Thanks, Schmidt.
- Agh!
Winston, my legs!
- Schmidt?
- My legs are seizing up.
- Schmidt!
- I hate my life.
I hate making new discoveries.
I'm a fear-based person, apparently.
Stop it.
Go.
I need a Call me-- Give me a hug, please.
911.
Ow.
Ow.
- Hey.
- Hey.
I'm sorry about last night, Amanda.
So you're, like, super into "cuddling".
No, I'm not super into cuddling.
I'm just getting out of a relationship, and I think I got nervous.
I've heard that I'm not great at talking about what I'm feeling all the time and so I'm sorry about last night.
Honesty.
I like that.
NlCK: That was nice.
Ha, ha.
Oh, yeah?
NlCK: Here we go.
Aah.
You're so hot.
I can't believe you're into me.
Okay.
Yeah.
NlCK: Okay.
There.
- All right, wow!
This is happening.
- Yeah.
Take off your pants.
NlCK: Okay, okay, okay.
Take your pants off.
- Yeah.
Take them off.
- You want me to take them off?
- Want me to take these off?
Okay.
- Yeah.
- Lights on, pants off.
Here we go.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ha, ha.
NlCK: I'm totally cool with this.
Ha, ha.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- All right.
Good.
Ha, ha.
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- What?
Who is that?
- Oh, my God!
NlCK: What are you doing?
Hi!
I'm Jess.
Welcome to our home.
We live in a world with rules.
We knock.
We have doors.
- And we knock on those doors.
- I'm sorry, Nick.
Just knock!
Nick, I fee-- - Put that down.
- But we have to talk-- Nothing to talk about.
I feel that Nick is not honoring the feeling stick.
I feel me too.
I feel Schmidt's had a particularly bad day and I feel that if Nick is truly Schmidt's friend he would show Schmidt what's in his pants.
I feel supported.
What is going on with you two?
What are you doing?
- I feel Nick is yelling.
- Stop it!
Yo.
I just wanted to thank you for taking me running.
Made me feel a lot better.
I might not have a job or anything, but at least I can run a mile.
Heh.
I mean, watching you try to run, yeah, that was just pathetic.
- I needed that.
- I suffer from exercise-induced asthma.
You suffer from exercise-induced crying?
It's a real thing, man, okay?
ElA.
You know what I learned from the lnternet?
We got nothing to worry about.
Everybody has their moment.
We might get a cat one day.
That cat might play the keyboard.
A bear might fall on our trampoline.
We don't need to have it figured out right now.
Our moments will come.
Hey, man.
Let's keep bro-ing out.
Come in.
Jess, you don't have to knock once you're in the room.
- I worked on something for you.
- All right.
Penis.
- Very good.
- Thank you.
Um, so did Amanda call you back?
- No, I don't see Amanda calling me back.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Maybe you were right.
Maybe I'm not ready for meaningless sex with beautiful women.
Well, you know, maybe when you are, you'll be able to show her your other penis.
- Your heart penis.
- Get out of my room.
Okay.
Hey, um, ha, ha.
When I was leaving in a hurry, um did you see everything?
Yep.
Even my gumbo pot?
Yuck.
Gumbo pot?
Get out!
Get out, Schmidt.
SCHMlDT: I'm the only one who hasn't seen it.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Cece!
What are you talking about?
- I saw you with her!
Beep-beep.
- I saw you.
- She said hi.
That's it.
- I saw you with her.
- Beep-beep.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
These traffic patterns are really counterintuitive!
Really catch-as-catch-can as far as footpaths go over here!
Oh, you're talking with your tongue down her throat?
Cece!
I got your text.
Are you ready to go home?
Unh!
Thank you for coming.
Jess, he was making out with another girl.
You get away from here.
Who are you?
You're blocking my booth.
Get out of here!
Don't talk to her like that, okay?
That is my best friend!
Unh!
Oh, my.
Cece.
- You ripped my deep V!
This is my favorite deep V!
It's just a deeper V. Thanks for picking me up, Jess.
I really felt that Gavin was different.
Didn't you feel like he was different?
Yeah.
I mean, he seemed like a really nice European DJ with a face tattoo.
Whoo!
Hey, guys.
Jess, I think these guys are into you.
We should just go back, right?
- We should totally head back.
- Where am I taking you?
Well, I can't go home because Gavin's, like, staying at my place.
You've known him for three weeks.
Can I just crash with you for a couple days?
Please?
I don't know.
It's Friday night.
The guys probably have big plans.
Friday night, gentlemen.
It's on.
- What happened to you?
- It's on and popping up in here.
You feel?
What happened to you?
You didn't used to be like this.
- What?
- You've gotten worse.
It's on and popping.
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess!
I told you I'd come through.
Benjamin invited us to a very cool party.
No.
Just got off three back-to-back shifts.
I just wanna sit here all weekend in silence playing this game go in my room and do stuff on my computer.
You wearing underwear?
What is between you and that chair?
- Just a little bit of sunshine.
- Take off that kimono, please.
It's my leisure wear, Winston.
Look, I worked 80 hours this week.
I just wanna come home, put on my 'mono and just hang loose, man.
Okay?
If you had a job, you'd understand.
Really?
Wow, it just got real in here.
You're not gonna take the kimono off?
Fine.
Then I'm not wearing any pants.
Boom!
Bam!
Mm-hm.
Everybody wanna walk around wearing stupid stuff guess what I'm gonna do?
I'm wearing a napkin on my face.
Bam!
How you like that?
- That doesn't make sense.
- Perfect sense.
It's totally different than me wearing my kimono.
You are laughing in the face of years of samurai culture - and it's an affront.
- Look at me now.
This is the vibe we have because of you.
- You wanna walk around here looking silly.
- This is handcrafted!
In China.
Schmidt, I think you should take the kimono off.
Um, Cece, can you not do your usual thing?
These are really good guys.
- Best behavior.
- Sure.
- Hey, guys, I brought-- WlNSTON: You brought this on yourself!
What you doing?
Oh, you know, we're just chilling.
Just chilling.
Just doing this.
You know, Friday night.
I'm gonna use the ladies'.
- What's up, Cecilia?
Where's the tequila?
- Guys.
Oh!
Oh.
Okay.
I would normally never bring her here, but Cece is really vulnerable now and when she's drunk, she has no boundaries.
So she's really grabby, really physical.
She's really loose with her body.
So I just wanna apologize in advance for anything that she might do.
- It's good to know.
WlNSTON: Yeah.
Thanks.
Thank you, guys.
You're the best.
Girl, look at that body Girl, look at that body This is the opposite of being alone!
This is the opposite of what I wanted this weekend!
Wow, how'd this happen?
Okay, I'm not a part of this, Schmidt.
I'm not a part of it.
Hi, Cece.
I'm gonna make you a bed on the couch, okay?
You're gonna have to stop dancing, so you can go to sleep.
Cece, I think you should dance if you want to.
- Why are you talking like that?
- I'm just hanging out.
- You get up.
SCHMlDT: Really?
Him?
But I'm doing this: - Get up.
- I don't dance.
I'm from the town in Footloose.
- He doesn't wanna dance.
NlCK: I don't wanna dance.
Schmidt dances-- Whoa.
What the-- ?
You know what?
I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.
What just happened?
It's really not great under here.
You have to love hair.
I think it's time for bed.
You can use my bed.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Over here.
Over here.
Oh.
- Over here.
Over here.
Are you sheepdogging her?
SCHMlDT: Over here, over here, over here.
Not here.
Here we go.
Ugh.
SCHMlDT: Good night, Cece.
Yes!
Yes.
She is sleeping on my sheets right now.
Not yours, bro.
Mine.
Parkour.
You know what?
I think I might actually have a chance with her.
I just have to be cooler than that guy.
SCHMlDT: Parkour!
A wise man foretold of a magical night where I would engage in nonsexual foreplay with a model, and tonight - Don't say-- - is that night.
Not a chance.
Never gonna happen.
You're not a closer.
I'm a closer.
I'm gonna close this conversation right now.
Watch this.
Boom.
Blam.
Closed.
Parkour.
- Short-track speed skating.
WlNSTON: Ha, ha.
Apolo Ohno.
- Well, at least this tires him out, right?
- Yeah.
She's great.
You're gonna love her.
Do you want some eggs?
I've got my own breakfast.
I don't need you to-- - What?
- I don't know, take care of me.
Just stop being so nice.
Your mother's being so nice.
Slam on my mother.
Your mother's gonna slam on your mother.
And 4000.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You're covered in oil?
What, oil?
No.
This is just-- Uh You okay?
Schmidt.
Hey, are you okay?
Whoa.
Whoa!
I just blacked out for a second.
Anything weird happen?
Okay, I need some water, so can you move?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen, honey.
Just, you know, slide me like a curtain, okay?
There you go.
I'm good.
I'm good.
Sweet.
Hey, can you get me a coff-- Mm.
- What's going on, guys?
- Hey-- Oh, you're all here.
Um, does the water get any hotter than this?
Uh-- Do you want me-- ?
Uh  I mean, I could give you-- lf-- I can-- I'm good at fixing-- Yeah, I can fix it also.
Actually, I'll just figure it out myself.
But do you have any actual soap?
Because all I can find in here is body gelato.
- That would be Schmidt's.
SCHMlDT: Mine.
- Don't use it all.
- I'll just not touch it.
SCHMlDT: Okay.
- Hey.
Why are you guys all in here?
- I'm brushing my teeth.
- Doing our things.
She hogging the shower?
Cece, hurry up.
Sorry, I just-- I can't find any bigger towels for some reason.
You have a beautiful body.
I appreciate that about you.
Okay, come on.
- I made you breakfast.
You did?
Yeah.
- Sorry.
I just-- - Disappointed with all of you, especially you.
- lt was a bad moment.
- I thought you were better than that.
- I know.
I am sometimes.
Did you see that cleavage?
I just wanna get my arm stuck down there, like, 127 Hours style.
And then-- And then:  I'll just cut it for days.
- I'll cut through the bone, the nerve.
- Schmidt!
You weren't upset because I was dancing with Nick?
- No, of course not.
- I think he's really into you.
Nick?
No.
- No.
- Come on, Jess.
This is classic Eduardo.
- You want this to go to Cece, right?
- Jess.
Okay, I'll give it to Cece.
No.
Jess.
- You don't want me to give it to Cece?
- Sí, sí, for you.
For me?
To give to Cece.
- We're just friends.
- Can't be friends with these guys.
You don't think every one of them thought about sleeping with you?
You just think everyone wants to sleep with everyone.
They do.
That's why I think that.
Don't you hear how he says your name?
"Jess".
He's from Chicago.
That's how people from Chicago say "Jess".
Like Bears, and milk, and:  "Let's go visit the Sears Tower".
Jess.
I'm going to the drugstore.
Need anything?
Yes.
Jess, you should go with him because then you can get that thing that you really need.
Oh, I wonder what that is.
She'll be right out.
Just  No.
No.
You are not coming in here and ruining all this.
I'm happy.
I like these guys.
I think they're actually starting to like me too.
Who did you tell me was your perfect man?
Walter Matthau in Grumpy Old Men.
I could be girl Jack Lemmon.
He's a total Matthau!
I'm telling you, he gets you.
See his feet?
A guy's feet point at what they want.
- His feet were pointing at you.
- Why wouldn't his feet point at me?
- Otherwise, he's standing like a duck.
- Go.
Get out there.
- Ugh.
NlCK: Hey, you ready?
Come on!
Be there in a sec, bro!
NlCK: You just call me "bro"?
Yeah.
Well, how long is she staying?
Oh, not long.
I know she can be tough to deal with.
Sometimes she calls me up and she's like, "Bitch, I love you".
And then she just hangs up.
No other information.
That's weird.
WOMAN 1: I love you so much.
I kind of like it when she calls me "bitch".
It makes me feel like Janis Joplin.
NlCK: Fine, but does she have to stay with us?
WOMAN 2: Yes, I will buy it.
What?
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
I'm saying stop trying to take care of everyone.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
- What?
Nothing.
What?
- What?
What?
What are you doing?
I know she's your friend.
I didn't mean to insult you.
You don't have to take care of her is what I meant.
Okay.
Yes.
NlCK: What are you doing?
What?
I'm just checking.
I wanna make sure.
If I insulted you, I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
- Everything is in its place.
- What does that mean?
I'm just walking like a friend.
Okay, you know what, forget this.
Let's get out of here.
Last on the list, toilet paper.
Um I don't use it.
You don't use toilet paper?
Heh.
I mean-- That's not what I meant.
- That's what your mother meant.
- My mother called?
What did she say?
No, Jess, I was-- Jess.
I was joking.
Look at her.
Go for it, man.
You know, go do your thing.
I don't like the roof, man.
There's a cat up here.
It's crazy.
It was raised by birds.
You're gonna let a cat stop you from that?
It's a bird-cat, man.
It's very dangerous.
Look it up.
Double rabies.
Right.
You can't close.
You just said the magic words, son.
Baby, baby, don't cry.
Look, I get it.
I was the best lover you ever had.
Yeah.
A 90-minute sesh is pretty standard for me.
It was "god" what?
Oh, it was "godlike".
Very sweet of you to say.
WlNSTON: My bad.
Pocket dialed you.
Heh.
I got dropped calls, then Winston calls.
It's crazy.
The roof, you know what I mean?
- lf he's bothering you-- - You both are.
Cool.
That's cool.
NlCK: What's going on with you, Jess?
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?
Say my name like that?
"Jess".
And why do you wear old man clothes all the time?
- I don't wear old man clothes.
- Ugh.
You don't like the way I dress?
- Ugh.
I just-- - Did I do something to you?
- No, I just need air.
- Okay.
Rose for the lady?
Okay.
I'll buy you one.
Or two.
They come as two?
I'll buy two.
- No, no.
- What do you mean no?
Take some.
- It's $2, it's not a big deal.
- No.
They're nice roses.
Hey, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Jess, it was a joke.
What are you doing?
Get back in the car.
Where are you going?
That's not the way home!
Just working on Saturday.
Pulling in them ducats.
It's crazy.
It's like golden handcuffs, know what I mean?
Like, on one hand, I'm killing myself and on the other hand, I'm making all this baller dough.
Sunburn.
Ha, ha.
- I told you to take that oil off.
- It's cool.
Just a little color.
In a couple of days, I'll be brown just like you, Cece.
- Because your culture is-- - What is my culture?
It's-- You're--  Jafanese?
Saudi-- Saudi Um - Monga-- - My parents were born in lndia.
India.
Totally.
Love lndia.
He really does.
Schmidt, tell her about all the things you love about lndia.
Uh, sure.
I love, you know-- I love Slumdog.
I love naan pepper, Ben Kingsley, the stories of Rudyard Kipling.
I have respect for cows, of course.
I love, uh, the Taj Mahal Deepak Chopra.
Anyone named "Patel".
I love monsoons.
I love cobras in baskets.
Naveen Andrews.
I love mango chutney.
- Really, any type of chutney.
Tepees-- - Schmidt, take a lap.
Refresh.
Yep.
- That was pretty good.
- I know.
You're working a little too hard.
Watch this.
- Schmidt!
- Yes.
- Go up to the roof.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go up to the roof.
- I'll be there in 10 minutes.
- Cool.
See you in, like, 10.
- That was-- - Make me a sandwich.
Sandwich.
I walked home.
- I got out of the car and I walked home.
- Why?
What happened?
His feet were pointed directly at me the whole time.
Did I do this?
Am I dressing too provocatively?
Do I need to get thicker pajamas?
Maybe it's my posture.
I have sexy posture.
Don't worry about it.
I will talk to him for you.
No.
That would be the worst thing you could possibly-- - Hi, Nick.
NlCK: Seriously, Jess what the hell happened?
I've been driving around looking for you.
Everything is okay.
We were hoping to get everything out on the table.
The table which is not a table, doesn't exist.
Don't worry about the table.
We were in the middle of traffic and you just got out and ran away.
- I was hot.
- You were so hot that you had to jump out of my car and run?
- Why are you standing like that?
- This is how I stand.
I've never seen you stand like that.
I was really worried something had happened to you, okay?
You can't walk around this neighborhood with bags of toilet paper that you don't even use.
What?
I told him I don't use toilet paper.
Okay, do you hear what he is saying to you?
He's trying to tell you he cares about you.
- No.
- So I'm gonna make this happen for you.
- He cares about me as a friend.
- This is so on, Jess.
- You are not-- - No.
I'm trying to help you.
- No.
- Okay, no, my face is my job.
My face is my job.
Okay.
Look--  No!
No!
- My earring.
- Okay.
- lt is stuck in your hair.
- Okay, can you get it out?
- No.
Ow.
- Okay, we'll do it on the floor.
We're gonna get on the floor.
Don't worry.
- All right, here we go.
Ow.
Ow.
- What's wrong?
I'm trying to help you.
- No!
No.
I don't need your help.
You don't know.
Nick and I are friends.
You don't know.
You don't have guy friends.
You just hang out with jerks like Gavin.
Oh, I'm sorry.
"DJ Diabeat lt".
- He has diabetes.
- Oh, he does?
Boo-hoo.
I'm sorry.
Is it really bad?
- I feel really bad.
- He's fine.
He takes medication.
Why do you just come in and you take over?
It's like you're playing mind games with people.
I'm trying to help you.
You never make a move.
Well, I don't need your help.
I like moving slow.
I like being weird and taking my time.
I'm not like you.
I don't just jump in the potato sack with the first potato that I meet with diabetes.
- Okay, what did you just say?
- You heard me, bitch.
SCHMlDT: Aah!
- Oh.
- What is that?
What?
- Oh, no.
- What did you do?
Oh, no.
What did you do?
No.
Hey, Schmidt.
How you doing?
Can I sit with you on your cooler here?
Yeah.
Just chilling, hanging with the cat.
Holla.
- I'm sorry that Cece did this to you.
- It's okay.
I'm used to it.
I guess I'll just always be the fat kid with the big dreams.
It's not you.
I love Cece, but she's not ready for you.
You're a good guy you know, if you ignore everything that you do on purpose and concentrate on all of the things that you do by accident.
Thank you.
She'd eat you up.
- You really think she'd eat me up?
- Yeah.
Like buffet style?
You know, all you can eat?
Because I got that prime rib, yo.
Heh.
Carving station, plates are warm, sneeze guard kids eat for free.
I mean, except for the-- Except for the last-- All right, let's go.
Let's go, Schmidt, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Cece.
Um Look, I get it.
This isn't gonna happen.
But the couch is super uncomfortable my sunburn's starting to blister and I just wanna sleep in my own bed.
Okay.
I'm sorry for everything.
I can be a jerk sometimes.
I hate sleeping alone.
Me too.
Sweet.
Sweet.
- Better when you don't talk.
- Yeah.
If you tell anyone we held hands, I have two people in my phone that will kill you.
Literally.
- Mm.
- Oh.
Hey.
I'm sorry I acted so weird today.
Weird!
It's okay.
- Yo.
SCHMlDT : I did it, man.
I'm holding her hand right now.
She's in my bed, asleep.
Wait, so you're in the room right now?
What is wrong with you?
Hang up the phone.
I did it.
I closed.
We could have this conversation at any time.
Shh.
Please.
- Okay, we're good.
- So we're clear, when I say closing - this is not what I'm talking about.
- Define your terms.
Because what I'm doing right now feels an awful lot like closing.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Fourth Thursday in November That is when we must remember How the Pilgrims would have died If not for friendship of a tribe - Hi.
- Hi.
Thank you so much for helping backstage this year.
Really it's made such a difference.
- That's nice.
- Yeah.
How-- ?
How is your boyfriend?
- We broke up.
- Oh.
- Sorry.
- Good riddance.
Just kidding.
What you doing for Thanksgiving?
Well, um, I always spend it with my grandmother.
- That's so nice.
- But she just died.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
That's terrible.
When?
About a month ago.
While I was writing the Halloween madrigal.
No wonder it was so deep.
What's it all about?
Is there any point?
Do we start dying The moment we are born?
Well, I better go warm up the gourds.
- Paul.
- Yeah?
Well-- Unh.
Oh.
- What is that?
I went to five grocery stores and I got the last turkey in America.
We're not doing Thanksgiving.
We talked about this.
We're just gonna watch football, drink beer.
Then we are going to Best Buy for Black Friday.
Or, as I like to call it, Friday.
- It's our thing, Jess.
It's Dudesgiving.
- No matter how many e-mails you send - that's not a thing.
It's not real.
- It's real.
It's been two years since I've had Thanksgiving.
- We talked about this.
- It's not a big deal.
I'm just cooking dinner for you guys and Paul.
- What?
- What?
- Hm?
What?
- Did you say "and Paul"?
Who's Paul?
Did you invite somebody to our house?
Yes, I did.
I asked someone out.
- Asked someone out?
- Jess, be honest.
- ls the turkey named Paul?
- It's a real guy.
And he teaches at my school.
And he's really, really hot!
And the turkey is named Hank.
Hanksgiving.
And we are gonna eat him, so-- Hanksgiving.
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Don't worry, guys, I will do everything.
Are we gonna be able to hang out with Paul - or is he also a teacher?
- He's a guy's guy.
He spends Thanksgiving with his nana.
She passed away.
That's a great plan, Jess.
Be the girl who replaces his dead nana.
I know.
Guys, look, this is a bad idea.
He's gonna be our fifth roommate.
- It's a first date.
- We don't know him, okay?
We gotta figure out whether he's right for us.
- We deserve to be happy.
You guys, don't even get up.
Just enjoy your beers.
It's gonna be great.
Just curious, does anybody know anything about cooking?
No pressure.
Just, like, cooking a turkey, for example.
It says you need some kind of string.
- Trussing string.
NlCK: Don't.
- That's a good tip.
You got more?
- Here's a tip.
Don't cook Thanksgiving dinner for five people in 14 hours.
Here's another tip.
Don't ask a guy out on a first date on the least sexy holiday in America.
- What are the most sexy holidays?
- Most sexy holidays are Fourth of July, uh Independence Day, obviously Women's History Month and Christmas.
- Will you help me?
- Definitely not.
What if I invite Cece?
NlCK: Don't do it, Schmidt.
Beer, football, Black Friday.
Thanksgiving with Cece.
NlCK: No, Schmidt.
- Okay.
- No, no, no.
NlCK: No, Schmidt.
I wanna let you know up front I've got control issues in the kitchen.
If I'm gonna do this, I don't want you touching anything.
I don't wanna hear, "You're using too much tarragon".
- Because I'm not.
- You will never hear that from me.
- I'm in.
NlCK: Come on, Schmidt.
Yes!
So this guy is gonna thaw out by tomorrow, right?
What are we, scientists?
Oh.
- Hey, look, it's ready.
- What am I gonna do?
He comes in three hours!
Oh, God.
- I can't get it in!
- We've all been here, am I right?
Jar.
Maybe if I take off clothes and get in bed - the heat of my body will warm it up.
- This is turning me on a bit.
It is?
- Hey, guys.
Cece.
Thank God.
Come here and lie on the turkey with me.
- Yeah, do that.
- Yeah, do it.
That would be good.
- This is a terrible idea.
- Yeah, 100 percent.
- I put it on permanent press.
- Good, so you don't have to iron it.
- No.
He's here early.
How do I look?
- It's better if you don't know.
- Hi.
Come on in.
Hey.
All right.
- Paul, everybody.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Welcome to our home.
- Thank you.
Hey.
It ain't so quirky to eat a lot of turkey On the Thanksgiving Day  My belly's wanting something A pie made out of pumpkin In every gobble-gobble way  I didn't know you were going back-to-back.
Happy Thanksgiving.
- There's two of them.
It's good to see you.
- So I'm just gonna freshen up.
- Oh, thanks.
And I'll be right back.
I roll my eyes at you I forgot to tell you.
Paul brought his violin and with a little coaxing, he might fiddle with the old horsehairs.
Well, uh, only if you don't mind being enchanted.
- I just wanna watch the game.
- Hey, Nick.
Can I talk to you?
I need you not to do that thing that you do.
- What thing?
I don't do a thing.
- You get mean and you make that turtle face.
- Okay, I don't make a turtle face.
- Talk to him like a normal human being.
Not about politics or small business loans or the Google conspiracy thing, okay?
I've only seen him at school and I wanna wow him tonight.
He's the only guy I've liked since Spencer.
I'm not good at this stuff, so please just help me.
All right, fine, I'll help you.
Shake on that, pardner?
I don't want to do it like that, though.
- Fair enough.
- Fair enough.
Can I sit here?
Hip-hop, hooray, ho, hey, ho  Parsley?
SCHMlDT: Yup.
Guy roommates.
Three guys.
It's intimidating.
I gotta be honest, it's intimidating coming to that arena.
It's hard to get to know people.
It's like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.
Bet you're the bear who has the bed that's just right.
- It's a teacher joke, sorry.
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
So I get to know you and you can know me - Yeah.
- we'll play a game.
- Oh, great.
Fun, yeah.
- All right.
You're gonna say the first thing that pops in your head.
Kazoo.
Okay, we haven't even started yet.
Okay.
Look, I'm gonna stick with kazoo.
Right, okay.
Um - Boundaries.
- lmportant.
- Okay.
Um, other people's stuff.
- Private.
Good.
Um Loud early morning sex.
Nice work if you can get some.
- Hey, Paul.
- Hey, Nicholas.
- What's going on?
Nicholas, wow.
- Playing word-association games.
- Kicking back pumpkin ales.
- I think that's a lager, right?
Mm-mm.
This is an ale.
Has to do with fermentation process.
Could be.
Hey, do you wanna watch football?
Maybe the Lions?
Ah, yes!
The mighty, mighty Lions of Des Moines.
They play every Thanksgiving because they're the most ferocious.
NlCK: Lions from Detroit.
Detroit Lions.
That's another-- What you gobbling about, turkeys?
Anyone who tells you the future of gravy is nitrogen-based is cooking with blinders on, Cece.
What is-- ?
Are you-- ?
Ahem, did you wash your hands?
- I'll wash them after.
- No.
See, just-- Can you just stop?
Because now the entire bowl of walnuts is compromised.
Wow, you're very sanitary.
Do you wash your hands 10 times a day?
Okay, look, don't worry, Cece.
If I need to, I can get my hands dirty.
I mean, I get dirty all over.
Would you eat this filthy walnut?
- Yeah, I mean-- Yeah.
- Okay, open your mouth.
- Yeah-- - Open your mouth.
No!
Beautiful savage.
- Oh, intermission.
- No, it's halftime.
It's parade time.
It's robot turkey.
It was Grandma's favorite.
We used to love watching the parade together.
She was the best.
Check it out.
Here she is.
Here's the lady.
Oh, she's beautiful.
Yeah.
We used to get in the funniest arm-wrestling matches.
Hey, uh, can I show you something?
Uh - Picture here.
That's my grandpa.
Aw.
Died last year.
- I'm so sorry.
Sorry, Winston.
- Thanks.
Thanks, man.
It's okay.
This picture was when he tried to quit drinking.
Heh, heh, heh.
That was a bad idea for everybody.
This is the first time he tried gelato.
He did not like that.
What was his name?
His name was Nelson.
- Hey, Schmidt, how's it going?
- Well, I need some walnuts.
I have no walnuts.
I should go get those.
You stay here.
Though, shoot.
I have had two pumpkin ales.
I probably shouldn't get behind the wheel.
Nick, how many pumpkin ales have you had?
Oh, I've had zero pumpkin ales.
Then can you take Paul to the store, right?
We'll get some walnuts Getting some walnuts I'm sorry, man, are you singing about what we're doing?
Yeah, guess I was.
Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it.
Where are you from?
- Chicago.
- Oh, land of plenty.
It's weird being in L.A.
It doesn't feel Thanksgiving.
It feels like there should be, like, a little nip in the air, you know?
A little bit of like-- - Yeah, totally.
- An autumn crisp.
- So Jess said you're a lawyer, right?
- I dropped out of law school.
- I had three semesters to go.
- Oh, what?
So close.
Still trying to figure it out?
That's what your 20s are for.
I'm 30, so Yeah.
Oh.
Mr. Copycat.
That's where I get my copies made.
- No way!
- Yep.
- You get your copies there?
- I don't.
It was the other one.
- Oh, you have got to be kidding me, man.
- No.
That's right.
I need long sustained mashes.
Oh, hey, you've got something on your nose right-- What?
No!
What is wrong with you?
Look at this recipe.
Look.
Where in this recipe does it say: "Put mashed potatoes on Schmidt's nose"?
Look at it.
No.
Here?
Here?
Here?
- Go on, show me!
- Schmidt!
- Oh, hey.
NlCK: Paul, move.
We got the nuts, Jess.
- I don't think Nick likes me very much.
- No.
Turkey!
Turkey's on fire!
Fire!
NlCK: Jar.
SCHMlDT: It's like a Prince video.
NlCK: Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
I really wanted you to have a good time.
WlNSTON: Remember when it was only dudes living here?
This is ridiculous.
Three months ago, we didn't know this girl.
My LASlK'd eye is freaking out.
That's it, we're leaving.
Let's get out of here.
- I've had a great time.
Paul, I am so sorry.
Going to the bar.
Can't get rid of smoke.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait, wait!
We can still do this.
What are you guys doing?
I have been dying to try that food you've been cooking.
You've been slaving away in there.
- What's your name again?
- Schmidt.
- Right.
- It's my last name.
Well, my last name is Genzlinger and I'd like to eat the food you've been making all day, Schmidt.
Yeah, all right.
Genzlinger.
- I'm with Genzlinger.
I have an idea.
Let's go next door.
Mrs. Beverly is great.
She's visiting her sister but she gave me her spare key for emergencies.
So we're breaking and entering.
That's a felony, FYl.
Hey, law school.
Nice.
No, we're not breaking in.
I gave her a key to our place too.
She sometimes has a problem with her shower.
No, not you.
You promised me you'd be nice to him.
I was nice to him.
I've been very nice to Paul.
The ride over I was nice to him.
Know what he tells me?
He likes Air Bud 2.
He loves dogs.
I know where he gets his copies made.
He likes to whistle.
He wanted to open the door with me.
So when my hand went up, so did his.
Oh, I get it.
He's not cool enough for you.
Because nobody can be cool enough for cool Nick Miller.
"I'm Nick Miller.
I'm so cool, I'll make my cool face".
- Why don't you like him?
NlCK: Do you like him?
Of course I like him.
NlCK: Okay, fine!
It doesn't matter what I think, does it?
- Because I don't have to have sex with him.
- I do.
I want to.
I want to have sex with him bigtime.
NlCK: Great.
You heard me!
Bigtime!
Okay?
I wanna take him down to Chinatown and slice him off a piece of this pumpkin pie, okay?
- What is pumpkin pie?
Do all the things you do in a bedroom with him, okay?
I wanna do it standing up and sitting down and half up and half down.
And the wiggly one, and the Bear Attack, and the claws in the head and the one figure skaters do, the What's For Lunch, the Give Me That Hat.
Let's just say that I'm good.
I'm really, really good.
- And I don't care what you think!
- Then why did you ask me?
Hey, Jess.
Uh, just want you to know everyone really loves Paul.
And also, we can hear everything you're saying.
- What?
- Play through.
After you, Jess.
Excuse me.
So, uh, just a heads up.
Uh, we're just rehearsing a play that Nick is writing.
It's called Big-Time.
It's about a man who, um, loves another man named Paul and it's not very good.
I'm so sorry.
I've done Give Me That Hat.
Only-- Only for me it was like, l-- You know, I was like, "Here, take my hat".
Do you know what I mean?
So how bad was it on a scale from one to bad?
Put it this way.
A normal guy would've left a long time ago and he's still here.
He's not normal.
Schmidt yelled at me earlier.
Ah, I'm so sorry.
Did he get weird?
He's weird about cooking.
Did you touch his whisk?
No, the thing is, Jess, is I think I'm into him.
What?
Oh, God.
He's got this rage inside of him, I just love it.
NlCK: Hey, Schmidt?
It's hour nine.
I'm starving.
Well, I can blanch or I can talk, but I can't do both.
I'm going in.
Nick.
I gotta say something to you.
I feel like you think I'm kind of annoying.
You didn't have to come here to say that.
If that's the case, which I don't know that it is-- - lt is.
- I don't care.
I actually feel sorry for you.
At this point in your life, I know you'll never dislike me - more than you dislike yourself.
- That's what you're going with, Violin?
Want a little napkin-folding music?
Kind of need it.
- I can't believe you're still here.
- What?
Of course I'm still here.
Why wouldn't I be here?
Hey.
Let's talk about what happened earlier.
Because you made me feel like I was a really bad girl.
I know I did, and I'm really sorry, Cece.
I'll never yell at you like that again.
- How about now?
- Pl-- - Please don't do that.
- Got my dirty little hands in your pudding.
So gr-- It's so gross.
Please.
Oh, God.
- Mm.
- Ahem.
- So gross.
- Yell.
- I'd rather you not do that.
- Haven't washed my hands since 3:00.
- I'm gonna double-dip.
- It's so gross.
How about now?
It's all the way-- It's all the way in there, with all the-- It's so unsanitary.
Please, just put it-- I'm begging you to-- Please just take the towel.
This may be none of my business, but I really have to ask you.
Did anything happen between you and Nick?
- Like, did you guys go out or-- ?
- What?
- Because I don't wanna get in the middle of-- - No.
No, no, no.
- No.
- Good.
Because I really wanna see you again.
Bigtime.
- Bigtime.
- Bigtime.
- Like the play.
- Yeah.
- Cool play.
- lt is.
- Do you really like him, Winston?
- Yes, man.
He asked me my grandpa's name.
You've never asked me my grandpa's name.
I always just thought he was your grandpa.
- You don't know my grandpa's name.
- Mason on your dad's or Charles on your mom's?
- Yeah, it's Mason and Charles.
SCHMlDT: Oh, baby.
Oh, that looks lovely.
- Genzlinger.
Schmidt!
SCHMlDT: Yeah, buddy.
You kidding me?
- lt looks incredible.
It does.
Play something for us before we start.
- Before?
Oh, no, no.
- Yes.
Please?
You're all hungry.
SCHMlDT: You wanna do it.
- Just do it.
- Please?
- Twist my arm.
SCHMlDT: Yeah.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Duet from the pageant, huh?
- Oh.
- Big entrance.
Okay.
Native Americans, gather ye round for I have a new friend I've met in the forest.
Dead body!
Dead body!
Holy God!
- There's a dead body.
A dead body.
There's a dead body!
There's a dead body!
- Oh, that is real.
That's a real thing.
- Oh, God.
Poor Mrs. Beverly.
Oh, Miss Beverly from the mailboxes.
- I'm so sorry, Paul.
- Oh, it was so fun.
- I had a great time.
SCHMlDT: Anytime, bro.
We're gonna go to a Best Buy later and grab a new dryer.
- Totally stop by if you need anything.
- Oh, good, good, okay.
Thank you.
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
All right, cool.
Hey.
No, no, no.
Coming in.
Coming in.
Guys.
- No, no, no.
- Get clear.
- At least she died doing what she loved.
- She was on the toilet, Jess.
- I'm starving.
- Really?
Even after that great meal we didn't have?
Aw, come on, Jess.
Are you gonna be mad at me all night?
Are you cold?
Do you want my cardie?
What's that?
- You came.
- Yeah.
When I was on that elevator ride, the coroners told me to stop crying like a girl.
- Told them that was sexist.
- You're right.
I am right.
And then I just decided life is too short.
Went around the corner, picked up turkey subs for your friends.
- Yup.
- They're footlongers.
And here I am.
Just a man and his violin.
- You're amazing.
Hey, no cutting!
- ls he cutting?
- He's not.
- Guys!
We got a cutter here!
NlCK: Calm down, pal.
NlCK: Stop.
SCHMlDT: Not cutting.
He's not.
He's-- I saved his spot.
SCHMlDT: Calm down.
Everybody, calm down.
- False alarm!
He's just doing fair tradesies.
Honestly, stop overreacting to cutting!
I'm going to the back.
This spot's for Paul.
Thanks, Nick.
- Thank you, Nick.
Hey.
Nick.
Wait.
- Let's go.
Come on.
- Hey, I'll go back there too.
JESS : Thursday in November PAUL : November - That is when we remember - The day we remember  How the Pilgrims would have died It's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better.
Without the friendship of a tribe Oh   Why don't you take the fiddle?
And fiddle it up and fiddle it down Fiddle it all over town   Thanks, Nick.
Woo-hoo!
Do-si-do.
NlCK: Where the hell are they going?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
SCHMlDT: Mmm.
You know you want in on this, man.
A little fatty tune.
A little yellow T, Cali roll.
Samurai snack.
So scrummy.
I'm good.
Looks like you're soloing on $80 worth of sushi, Schmidt.
I got the means.
I get why you don't wanna get down, Nick.
But, Winston, you gotta climb aboard, man.
You got a serious J-O-B now.
- Serious?
- Yeah.
Dude, it's a temp job.
If you mean piece of crap, yeah, it's serious.
- Surprised you haven't made a game of it.
- I tried.
I'm losing my mind, guys.
I sometimes touch the frayed part of the power cord just to feel something.
What's up, guys?
- Nobody has lady guests coming over?
- Lady guests?
And how do you feel about opening your home and your hearts to the youth of America?
Yo, Miss Day, where should we set up these bells?
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess  I'm so sorry, you guys, I should have told you but the center decided to turn our space back into a hallway so I had nowhere to go.
Is this something that a mean, creative judge made you do?
This is just like a nightmare I had where you brought over teenagers with bells.
These kids had a choice between early-morning detention and music.
And they all chose music.
- No kidding?
- Desiree, bells are not for hitting.
Kids wanted to play band instruments, but we got a donation of handbells which are trés, trés dope.
Miss Day, can I eat some of these crackers up in here?
No, no, no.
Water crackers are for adults to eat with adult cheese.
Can I eat a cracker sushi sandwich?
No.
Jess.
You gonna sit around all night playing "Jingle Bells"?
"Jingle Bells" is a trash song played on a trash instrument.
And I'm not really asking permission, I'm giving you a heads-up.
Well, that got serious.
Anyway, you are gonna love these kids.
Thank you, Schmidt.
Wonderful.
Great, guys.
So good.
Just think, you could be in detention right now.
- ls it too late to choose detention?
- We suck.
We don't suck, we just need a little bit of rehearsal.
Hector.
Okay, good.
Big finish and we're out.
I'm so proud of you.
That's what it feels like to play a song sort of together.
Bring it in.
In.
Yes.
- Ensembell.
Ensembell!
Five minutes of text time, you earned it.
DESlREE: Oh, dip.
Miss Day!
Desiree?
DESlREE: Miss Day.
- Oh!
You got a twisted toilet, Miss Day.
Nick, toilet situation.
Code one.
Water only.
- You didn't tell her the system?
- She went rogue.
Turn on the faucet before you flush the toilet because it's-- NlCK: All right.
- Thank you, Nick.
- All right.
There we go, no problem.
Perfect.
You did it.
Plastic soda bottle is right where it's supposed to be.
- Back in the wall hole.
- What?
It's fixed.
Heard that before.
It's fixed.
It's fixed.
It's fixed.
Nick, repeat after me: "l am not the Chinese kid from Goonies.
" You know, I fix things just to the point of working, Schmidt.
- lf you want a fancy fix, just say so.
SCHMlDT: Okay.
Please fancy-fix the toilet.
That's all you had to say.
That actually sounds good.
Whoa.
You're amazing.
Goose pimples.
Look, each one a memory.
Winston, please help me.
Just hear me out.
Two things women love: Alternative percussion players and role models.
Kids would love it and we'd get to spend time together.
You gotta do it.
It's a mitzvah, bro.
- Sure you've never rung before?
WlNSTON: Believe it or not I've never played handbells before.
I pick things up easy, that's all.
I know handbells aren't the coolest instrument they might not even be the fifth coolest, but the kids would love it it would mean a lot to them, and if they saw how good you are they'd really get into it and maybe try a bit harder.
Also, there's, like, a lot of potentially cool Iike, bell shorthand we could use to talk about Nick.
While he's right there, we'll be like, "Nick is such a tinkle".
"He's more like a tonkel".
"Tinkle' and "tonkel" are potential bell talk we could use.
- I get it.
Just be cool, please.
- I am cool.
Before you make your decision I'd only need you till the concert on Sunday.
- I don't know, I think I could be into this.
- Yay.
And with that statement, he never had sex again.
Winston and me are playing bells Every day Until Sunday.
I'm cool.
I don't mean to nag, but how long is this gonna take?
Fancy fix, fancy amount of time.
Because I would like to use my own bathroom now.
Sir, bathrooms are for customers only.
How dare you.
If only there were some sort of pipe-and-water expert that we could hire to come and fix this problem.
- I can't afford a plumber.
- That's what it's called.
Wanna do this?
Wanna have this fight with me?
You wanna go down this path?
- ls this a path you recently fixed?
- It's called self-reliance.
Because unlike you, Schmidt I don't just throw my money at problems.
All I hear is I can't use my bathroom because you're poor.
It's your lucky day.
I'm gonna pay for the plumber.
No, I don't want your charity.
Well, you seem very happy using my emergency tools.
Oh, yeah?
Do you even know what this is?
- Doy.
It's a scissor.
- Yeah, that's exactly right.
A scissor.
Really, Schmidt?
Yeah, a scissor that you just threw in the turdlet.
So at rehearsal, keep an eye out for Hector.
I'm having trouble getting him to interact.
He wanted to play drums so I told him bells were the next best thing.
I couldn't keep a straight face while saying it.
He saw right through me.
So why do you do this bell thing, Jess?
I mean, like, how do you win?
You don't win.
You win by helping the kids.
I just wanna get them to care and try hard, you know?
- You want them to try hard?
- Yeah.
WlNSTON: I'll get them to try hard.
No, I'm telling you - they're not gonna listen to you.
WlNSTON: Okay.
Oh, what, a plumber?
You plan it this way?
Just to rub my face in it?
I wanted rub your face in our working toilet.
- That toilet I will never use.
- Never gonna go to the bathroom again?
You're the soda-bottle guy.
That was smart.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Okay.
- Question: How much did he pay?
- Know what, that's enough.
- Fifty dollars?
Hundred?
SCHMlDT: lnappropriate.
"My name's Schmidt.
I was born rich.
I had a $40,000 bar mitzvah".
How long you gonna do the petty act for, man?
A week?
A month?
Is this my favorite bedspread all over again?
That was a handmade gift my nanny gave me that you spilled a pitcher of Midori Sours on.
- And now you bring it up like it's nothing?
- I left you a check for $30.
Your nanny gave you that for free.
As far as I'm concerned, you're up 30 bucks.
My nanny is dead!
I'm not looking to make money off of her!
I will not apologize again for the Midori Sours!
Who drinks Midori Sours?
- Everyone drinks Midori Sours!
- They don't!
- Melon liqueur!
- I would never drink one!
- American classic with Asian influences!
- Winston would never drink one!
Enjoy the couch.
I bought that too.
Enjoy the rug too, paid for that.
Organic woven.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
- Oh, come on, man.
- Well, I stole the cable!
And my bar mitzvah was an amazing event.
The theme was sports jams.
Oh, my God.
BlANCA: Wow, that was really good.
That was amazing.
- That was off the hammer.
Heh.
The hammer in the bell.
Heh, heh.
Tough crowd.
I was thinking, okay, if we wanna win this concert - play something cool.
"Eye of the Tiger".
- What's "Eye of the Tiger"?
The greatest song ever written.
- It's so cool, it ended the Cold War.
- That's not even a little bit true.
I never thought bells could be cool.
What do you mean?
I make bells cool.
Do that thing where you hold three bells in one hand-- - Three-in-hand.
- I think she's talking about the Winston.
BlANCA: The Winston.
- It's called the three-in-hand.
I can do it.
Yeah, but can you do this?
Oh, my God.
- That was really pretty.
But Miss Day has a few tricks up her sleeves as well.
- Let's see what you got.
Come on, Miss Day.
Let's see what you got, Miss Day.
Come on.
I am a robot Trying to play the bells Don't judge me Because I can't think at all I just like to play the bells - I wanna play "Eye of the Tiger".
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, please.
- I don't know.
That sounds so fun, but we can't because we don't have time.
- Oh, darn.
WlNSTON: Here's what I was thinking.
If you skip school and practice, then, boom, you got it.
Mr. Bishop.
Yeah, yeah.
BlANCA: Done.
Yeah, you got it.
DESlREE: No problem.
What's the deal with Winston?
He's really intense.
No, look, I grew up with Winston.
I know how he is.
He's incredibly talented, but he's a jerk about it.
One of those guys that'll never pass the ball if he thinks he can score.
I don't know why it needs to be a competition.
That's just the way some guys are, Jess, you know?
They get themselves wrapped up in these insecure silly games.
Hey, Nick, uh, we're good with that whole plumber thing, right?
- Absolutely.
SCHMlDT: Yeah, okay, cool, because-- I was right about that whole thing.
Oh!
- I unfixed that.
- How are you gonna unfix a dead Schmidt?
- I'm not worried about it.
SCHMlDT: You should be worried!
You're so predictable, Schmidt!
I have fixed everything.
JESS : Stop yelling - I don't wanna hear you yelling anymore - I'm gonna unfix everything I fixed.
What-- ?
- I paid for the freezer, so, you know - I'm gonna kill you.
That's a B right there.
Get that in there.
You're fired.
Focus.
Are you focused?
Okay, what's the song about?
- Hector?
- Hanging tough, staying hungry.
A man and his will to survive.
- Are you brown-nosing me?
- Yes, I am.
You're so cool.
- Where are your eyes?
On the tiger.
One, two, three, four.
Two, three, four.
No, no, no!
Are you kidding me?
It is not that hard, people.
It is an instrument that a cat wears around its neck.
Know what?
I think they did a pretty great job considering they've only played it eight times.
You thought wrong because I'm out there right now by myself in the cold.
I got no support.
- Maybe we're not good enough.
- No, you are good enough.
This is not your problem, this is Mr. Bishop's problem.
Pah.
Rest.
Pah, pah, pah.
Rest.
Pah, pah, pah.
Rest.
Pah, pah, pah.
Rest.
Can you hear it?
It's a very famous song.
- Mr. Bishop.
WlNSTON: Tell you what.
Here.
Here.
You're gonna play these, okay?
Play these until you figure it out.
Right?
Don't play these.
And what are you laughing at, WNBA?
This is what you look like:  Like fighting off a shark.
This is what I want: - Mr. Bishop.
- Petting a dolphin.
Oh, yeah, there we go.
All right, and you.
- You didn't make me wanna throw up.
- Really?
- Now, come on, people.
- Out.
- What?
- Out of the group.
You're being mean.
Fine.
I don't need this.
I warned y'all about these bells.
Told you, told you, told you.
I'm gonna make you guys a pitcher of my famous virgin sangria.
Isn't that just juice?
This has to stop.
It's not my war!
Hey, uh, maybe Jess is right.
- We should talk this thing through.
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?
Gonna put a clean shirt on.
- Yeah.
Great, man.
- What is that?
- I'm sorry.
I put your couch and your freezer in your room, Schmidt.
I didn't wanna get my poor on them.
I gotta get in there.
I've to go to a networking event later.
- Scott Caan is speaking.
- Ugh, would you listen to yourself?
- Did you use my conditioner?
- No.
- No, I can tell, man.
- What are you doing?
Lotusberry Relax.
Lotusberry Relax.
I can smell it on you right now.
Fine.
Stop smelling my hair.
- Know how much that costs?
- I didn't use your conditioner.
Why does your hair look so soft?
Fine, Schmidt.
I ran out of shampoo and I used your conditioner.
- We're talking about conditioner.
- You used it as shampoo?
It's for moisture, Nick, not for cleaning.
I can't believe we're friends.
Give me it back.
- Give you what back?
- Give me it back.
- Think about what you're doing.
- I'm squeezing it out.
- You're squeezing it out?
- Yes, I am.
Stop squeezing it out of my hair.
- Okay.
It's on.
It's on.
It's happening.
- lt is?
- lt is happening.
- Oh, you want-- ?
These are the first moments of what is happening now.
This is the beginning of what's happening right now!
- Wanna get dirty?
- Yeah.
- Whoa!
- Come on, Schmidt!
You little rich-boy sissy!
Come on!
Who you gonna hire to fight me, boy?
Stop running!
Stop running, Schmidt!
- You want it so bad, you got it!
- Okay!
Enough!
Where is this coming from, man?
Look, you chose to be a bartender.
You chose to drop out of law school.
You're not some down-on-your-luck guy, you're just a loser who--  I didn't mean-- It's fine, man.
Okay.
Whatever, whatever, whatever, man.
These are things that come out, man, when you take another man's conditioner.
Winston, we need to talk.
We had a dress rehearsal.
It was horrible.
Stop it!
Oh, hey, Hector!
Hey!
Those are expensive!
- I'm sorry, Jess, but I really don't care.
- Know what, I love running this group.
It gives me confidence, it gives me muscle definition.
Yes, sometimes it gives me blinding optical migraines where I literally can't see three feet in front of myself.
But I love these kids.
And I'm sorry I kicked you out of group but one thing you can't do with these kids is make it about you.
Jess, I don't see what the big deal is, okay?
I only practiced a couple of times.
You're such a tonkel.
Hold it.
Don't nobody call me a tonkel.
If you tell them they aren't good, that's one more person telling them.
That's a big deal, making sure no one else gives up on them.
Even if they sound like a guy covered in bells falling down a staircase that's also made of bells.
I know you've had a hard month, I know you don't have a job but, God, they're just kids.
Also, what happened to the refrigerator and the sofa?
Did we get robbed by giants?
NlCK: You know what sucks about getting older?
Your friends have known you for way too long.
- They've got too much on you.
- Yep.
I want friends who lie to me because they don't wanna hurt my feelings.
I sadly kind of mean that.
What happened to us, man?
We used to be so cool.
And I was gonna play basketball and be a gazillionaire.
Right.
I told myself I was never gonna live with Schmidt.
- Who do you live with now?
- With Schmidt and he's killing me.
He's killing me.
I got fired from a temp job.
Yeah, I got kicked out of bell group for being too mean to kids.
- I've been meaning to talk to you.
- You ain't gotta talk to me, I know it.
I know it, man.
But I was just enjoying - being good at something.
- Yep.
Does she want me to not care what the song sound like?
This is your thing, though.
It's not always about being the best.
It's not always about you, Winston.
This is about kids.
Just pass the ball.
I'll drive, pal.
Hey, you wanna go to this bells concert?
Let me get my cardigan.
I know you're nervous, you wanna do a great job you wanna sound great, but it's not about that.
There's a really big crowd of people who's really excited and wants to hear some bells.
Look.
All right, bring it in.
Hello, Pershing Park.
- We are Ensembell.
KlDS: Ensembell.
MAN 1: What did you say?
- I said Ensembell.
She said Ensembell!
It's on the banner, stupid!
MAN 2: You guys gonna play something?
But first I'd like to welcome Winston Bishop to the stage.
What's a Winston Bishop?
WlNSTON: Hey.
What's up?
- "Eye of the Tiger"?
- Hector, you think we can pull this off?
- Probably not.
- Yeah, I don't think so either.
So let's do it.
One, two, three, four.
Two, three, four.
Know I don't think you're a loser, right?
Can't hear anything you say when you wear that sweater.
You open your mouth and I just hear, "Cardigan.
I am wearing a cardigan".
SCHMlDT: This is super embarrassing.
NlCK: Yeah, it's terrible.
It's the eye of the tiger It's the thrill of the fight Risin', watchin' us all SCHMlDT: You don't like the cardie?
NlCK: No.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Oh, yeah.
Wait, wait.
Are we really gonna do this?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Okay.
Intercourse, intercourse Intercourse.
Intercourse.
- Sorry, that was weird.
- No, no, no.
It's okay.
- I have to go to the loo.
- Okay.
Hey, tiger.
You're having sex tonight.
Don't give me that look.
Just do it.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
You kidding?
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.
I just haven't had sex with anyone but Spencer in six years and I get so nervous.
It's like starting a new job with a really weird interview.
Don't worry about it.
I'm good.
I'm more than good.
It's okay.
You know what?
Tomorrow night.
Let's just go out to dinner and then just nail each other.
Just pound each other.
V- bomb on the P-bomb.
I would have the P-bomb, right?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- It's Jess.
NlCK: Yes, I'm confirming the appointment.
I made the damn appointment.
That's what-- Why wouldn't-- ?
Yeah, okay.
Appointment confirmed.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Not a chance I'm going.
Can you not do this?
Look at your hair.
You look ridiculous.
- What am I supposed to talk about?
- It's a haircut.
NlCK: No, you're trapped.
You can't move.
They're standing behind you with their hands in your hair and they expect you to talk back.
Oh, yeah, it's your baby.
Cute.
Yeah, your baby's cute.
I tell you what, just come to my place.
No, I'm not going to a black barbershop.
I've seen the movies.
I know how fast they talk.
I don't need to seem any less cool than I do.
- Want to go to my salon?
- Hey.
- Hey.
- So, um, heads up, Paul is coming tonight.
And, uh, I just wanted to tell you that I'm gonna tap him like a maple tree.
I'm gonna be searching for some syrups.
- I'm gonna be having sex with him.
- All right.
- Why you telling us this?
- I want to give you a heads up.
You nervous?
You need tips?
No, I'm not nervous.
Just, you know, I can drive stick.
Okay, because it seems like you're freaking out a little bit.
With this whole activity.
- That's not stick, that's automatic.
- That's not automatic.
Another bathroom break, Schmidt?
You know, I've been timing you all day.
Seven minutes and 23 seconds.
I wonder what was going on in there.
- Hmm?
You pooped.
- Can you stop timing me, please?
- That's ridiculous.
- I will break you.
Hey, Lisa.
You were on fire last night, girl.
- I'm taking her job.
- What did you do last night?
Everyone went to Jill's bachelorette party.
Why don't I get invited places?
Is it because I'm the only man in the office?
"Man".
That's adorable.
- How's it-- ?
- Sarah got promoted.
- Sarah?
With the gums?
- Yeah.
- So she's out of the-- - That corner cubicle, it's free.
So much kickback space.
And, you know, Gina personally invited me to her baby shower tonight.
So that corner cubicle, that's all mine.
You're like a Bond villain.
You just told me your whole plan.
Heh.
Mr. Darcy's going to love my new bonnet.
Why are we here?
You don't understand.
You've never been cheated on before.
Spencer and I never tried anything new, and maybe if I had been more erotic-- Spencer cheated on you because he's a total jerk - not because you're bad in bed.
- It's been six years.
Everything I know about sex I learned from Spencer or the Clinton impeachment trials.
He used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the oval office area-- JESS'  Jess.
- Mom?
I'm not listening to NPR.
No.
No whistle.
It's terrible.
Ah, excusez-moi.
Can I try this on, please?
Oh, the starfish.
You can't try that on.
Health code.
I'll take it.
Hah!
I hope Paul is packing some coral polyps because this starfish is hungry.
- Starfish eat coral polyps.
- Just pay, Jess.
Today I'm gonna show you how to cut your own hair.
- I consider myself-- - Whoa, what the hell are you doing, Nick?
It's a haircut, human interaction.
You're a bartender.
You talk to strangers every day.
I don't like when they touch my head, Winston.
I don't like it.
- Go to the damn salon!
- No, it's fine, okay?
I'm learning how to do it myself.
I'm learning from this video.
Aah!
WlNSTON: Oh!
- Oh, my God, man.
Oh!
Oh!
I was wondering why it had so many views.
Let's watch it again.
- Hey.
- What?
You know, Gina, I was just walking by and I mean I was literally pulled in here by the glow.
- What do you want?
- I was just working at my cubicle which, between you and me, is surrounded by a couple of chatty Cathys.
That's their names.
Cathy S. and Cathy G. They won't shut up about a baby shower tonight for a certain VP VP.
Very pregnant vice presidente.
You're the worst.
Seriously, the worst.
Get out.
Honestly, it would mean so much to me if you would let me come to your shower.
Okay, fine.
Come to my baby shower.
- I can come?
So I'm invited?
- Yeah.
You're invited.
I'm gonna get you one of those portable baby pumps.
You're just out there every day but pumping yourself at the same time, you know, just milking away.
Just:  - Get out.
- Okay, I'm gonna go.
- Why don't we meet here at 8?
PAUL : Great.
Okay.
Uh, where's the place?
Um, I think it's in Koreatown.
- Let me check.
- Exotic.
Ah, let me see here.
Jess?
What?
Oh, um - Sorry, uh, can I call you back?
- Yeah.
Hey, Schmidt.
Can I borrow your computer?
Nick?
Winston?
What?
What?
Hey, do you have my comput-- ?
Oh, my computer.
- I have your computer.
- I can see that.
Hey, I gotta cram for this baby shower.
Can I have it back?
I've been watching porn.
- I found your red folder.
- How long have you been doing that for?
- Are you okay?
- Five and a half hours.
Wow.
You went deep, Jess.
Real deep.
Help me, guys.
I have 15 minutes.
Teach me how to be good at sex.
I just-- I have to go on this date right now and I can't do it.
I'm freaking out, okay?
I need all of you to sit in front of me and tell me what guys like in bed.
Right now.
- What do you wanna know?
- Okay.
Um, when you're-- If you're in the-- If you're holding-- Sorry.
Start over.
Um When you reach - Completion?
NlCK: Yeah, that was it.
No, wait.
NlCK: I can't do this.
- Come on.
Come back here.
- Jess, guys wanna be whisked away.
- Be enchanted.
- Just take your clothes off, Jess.
Do you think that Paul watches stuff like that?
- All the time.
- Probably watching it right now.
Okay.
I put this on mute because this girl is, like, pretty loud.
And my main thing that I took away was: "Gosh, that young lady can really multitask".
- Super normal.
What she's doing.
- Don't know if every girl is like that.
Wondering if there are trendy moves.
Because I've been doing the same four for the last six years, like: Aah, and you know, like: That one and-- I don't know.
Do you think that Paul would be into, like, something like that?
What, a little light choking?
I bet Paul is into some pretty dark stuff.
- Light choking?
- No one's doing that.
You're hooking up with the wrong girl.
I'm hooking up with the right girl because they don't choke me.
- Nick is meat and potatoes.
We're sushi.
- Don't wanna be a part of this.
NlCK: You're better at sex than me?
- Yeah.
What did you do after you lost your virginity?
Don't say that.
You're taking it out of context.
He said, "ls it okay I didn't get my pants off"?
- That's a true story.
That really happened.
- I was 16 years old.
And I've gotten a lot better.
You haven't gotten that much better.
I used to listen to you and Caroline.
It was like listening to a rescue crew trying to communicate with a stranded miner.
"Are you okay"?
"Yeah".
"Are you okay"?
- "Yeah".
- Hey, guys, I don't have much time.
Can we get back on track?
I need to know what to do.
Would flicking be, like, a cool thing?
No.
- No.
- Absolutely not.
Role play?
Do you know any voices?
Yes.
I can do an old-timey newscaster, like:  "Hi, there, son.
I'm gonna kick you into next Tuesday, see"?
For the last 15 years, you've been thinking I'm bad at sex.
- I'm fantastic at sex.
- Dude, you're scared to get a haircut.
I don't like getting a haircut.
What does that have to do with sex?
You got a question, come to me because I'm obviously the best.
No, you're not the best.
Who do you think, of the three of us - is the best at sex?
- Yes.
And take emotion out of it.
No one's feelings are gonna get hurt.
Especially, you know, Nick and Winston's.
No, I'm not doing this.
- Say a name.
WlNSTON: Go with your gut.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey, Paul.
Hey, Paul.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, goose.
Hey, goose.
- I'm gonna go get ready.
I'll be back.
Okay.
- I'll just hang out with the guys.
Cool.
- Hey, guys.
What's up?
SCHMlDT: What's up, man?
WlNSTON: What's up?
- You're looking at me like what?
Goose is short for me gusta Jess.
- What?
- Come here, sit down, man.
I am so tired of people being so careful with me.
It's like I am 40 and I am pregnant.
I am not made out of crackers.
Hey, ladies.
What are you guys talking about?
- Afterbirth.
- Afterbirth.
That's like the party you guys have after you have the baby.
- Sort of.
- I'd like to be invited to that.
They say an afterbirth ain't an afterbirth without some Schmidt up in there.
- Come here.
- I'm gonna talk to you in a bit.
- What are you doing?
- I'm rocking this party.
Watch this.
Hi, how's everybody doing?
You know, I just wanted to take a moment to-- Well, to say how honored I am to celebrate the journey of Bogart through Gina, and out and into the light.
Here's to elective C-sections.
Just face it, baby.
You don't know the first thing about women.
Aah, you're the best, Beth.
I don't know if you know this about me, but I was in two frats in college.
You wanna know why?
Because I just couldn't decide.
Hey, ladies.
Let's get this party started.
We're all getting drunk tonight!
Except for you, Gina.
Horribly irresponsible.
So I'm looking forward to having sex tonight.
Yeah.
Me too.
Sex is the bomb.
Sorry.
That sounded like a guy from Entourage.
Do you like porn?
No.
Do you?
Yeah, I mean, l-- Yeah.
I do like pornos.
Yeah, you know, when my imagination isn't really working or I've exhausted the bullpen.
I just find it very erotic.
And then I just love, like everything that's erotic.
SCHMlDT: Yeah, party!
Party, yeah!
Yeah, Gina, yeah!
Baby wants his bottle, yeah!
Party!
Schmidt!
Schmidt!
Schmidt!
- Aha!
Yeah!
- This is so weird!
- I love it!
- Aah!
I'm having a baby!
She's having a baby!
Yeah!
Things people say sometimes, I don't really write it, but I think-- Are we gonna do this?
- Yeah, definitely.
- Sit down.
Okay.
Whoa.
Wow.
- You are hot, hot, hot.
- Thank you.
Hello, weather service?
Oh, there's a heat wave from Portsmouth to Port, Kansas.
I don't know, I don't-- What is happening?
We're talking dirty, slim.
Oh, okay.
You're doing a voice.
You want me to do a voice?
Okay.
Um  Well, I'm so happy to be here.
Jimmy Stewart?
You look ravishing in your netting-- - Thank you very much.
- Contraption.
Why don't you let me see your caboose?
Okay, here.
Let me go ahead and-- - Your caboose.
Your butt.
- Oh, my butt.
Okay.
Here's my caboose.
Oh, happy birthday, me!
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- No.
No, it was great.
I just-- It felt so good and sensual.
You want me to wiggle it around?
How about you help me get a little more comfortable?
Oh, all right, dear.
Okay.
I'm gonna try something different.
I just-- Oh, okay, great.
Young man.
Young man, the things I'm gonna do to you.
Well, I can't wait to-- Young man, don't take all day.
Well, I understand, ma'am, but you're wearing chain mail here.
- I am not getting any younger.
- It's like an erotic rope course.
Okay, l-- Let me try up here.
- I think it's-- -  I can't do the voice - and get this off at same time.
-  Okay.
- ls that-- ?
Are you okay?
- Yes.
This is--  I'm gonna split you like a log!
Wait, hold on.
What is that?
-  It's a lumberjack.
- Hold on one second.
Can we just start over and just kind of go back to basics for a minute?
Just you and me.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Just our regular voices.
- Ha, ha.
All right.
See?
So nice.
So nice.
- You're hurting me.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.
I'm good.
- Let me get you some water.
- Yeah.
- I have good water at home.
- I have water here.
I have a filter.
It's a special ionized filter I got at home.
Okay.
NlCK: I'm glad you convinced me to go to your barbershop.
Wow, man.
I-- It actually looks really good.
Right?
I look good.
I loved it there.
Think they liked me?
- I think they loved you in there, man.
- Okay, good.
- How did it go?
NlCK: Is he still in there, Jess?
There's no more tea.
I forgot to buy tea.
Hello.
Where's-- ?
Where is the door?
Hey, what's up, Jess?
You okay, Jess?
I messed up.
He ran away.
He got scared.
Why would he be scared?
Because I choked him.
I lightly choked him.
WlNSTON: Wow.
That's what happens when you listen to Schmidt.
It's just when I was with Spencer, I didn't even think about this.
- I just did it.
NlCK: Okay.
Here's the thing.
You gotta stop thinking about it.
Just relax and be yourself.
You're awesome.
- What do you think, Winston?
- Why are you asking Winston?
Nick, look at your hair.
You don't look like someone who's good at sex.
I can't believe you just said that.
You're gonna stop worrying about it.
Completely.
- That's really good.
- Literally what I just said.
What are you worried about anyway?
Paul doesn't care what you do.
I've seen the way that boy looks at you.
- And he is crazy about you.
- I agree, l-- Shh.
I'm trying to listen to Winston.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Paul - Hey, Winston.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah.
- We'll step into my office.
- Okay.
- Hey, Nick.
NlCK: Okay.
Um - Hi - Hi.
- So last night was-- - No, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, don't, please-- - Unacceptable.
I'm really intimidated by you, Jess.
You're so experienced and I've never done that stuff that S & M style, bondage stuff.
It scares me a little but I wanna do it because I know that you're into it.
Just please be gentle with me at first, okay?
I really like you.
- Really?
- Yeah, I do.
And nothing else matters.
Except, just no fire and no handcuffs, please.
Please, please, please.
Okay?
And I'm allergic to felt.
And most polyurethanes.
Okay, well, that's it.
- And no bugs too.
I don't know if that was-- - Paul, wait.
Um Last night was kind of a low point for me.
I mean-- I'm not really into that stuff.
I just-- I thought that whatever I used to do wouldn't be good enough sexy enough, advanced enough.
That's why I did that.
- Oh, no!
- Sorry.
No.
It's okay.
It just surprised me a little bit.
I just-- I like you.
Well, good.
I'll walk you down.
Okay.
- Oh, um, the new trombones came in-- - Paul.
That doesn't speed it up when you do that.
WlNSTON: I know, I know.
We're about to see a movie.
You wanna come?
Sure.
Hey, Jess?
Is that your shoe?
Boy, your haircut look like a high-rise.
Where the penthouse at?
Hey, old man, where did you steal those pants?
Off of Danny Glover's grandfather?
I am Danny Glover's grandfather.
I'm big fan of his work.
He's great in the Lethal Weapons.
No, I'm not.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Ican't believe Jess got me roller skates for Christmas.
I feel so free.
- Don't.
- Let's see this.
"Merry Christmas, Brendan.
Don't swallow these.
Love, Uncle Nick".
He's a 12-year-old kid, it's a bunch of tacks.
- He's gonna love them.
Give it to me.
- I hate Christmas.
First of all, it means that Hanukkah is over.
I hate it when you guys leave and go home.
- When are you leaving?
- I think 4 a.m. WlNSTON: Three p.m. NlCK: Is that it?
Schmidt, don't worry.
We'll hang at your office party.
Please tell me you're not dressing up like Santa.
I'm the only man in the office.
Of course I will.
Look, I like it.
I get all this dirt on my coworkers.
They get drunk and whisper what they want for Christmas and I use that information to undermine them and control them for the rest of the year.
WlNSTON: Ah, true spirit of Christmas.
Winston, you'd better watch it because I will take you down.
You want to go?
You want to go?
You're gonna take me down?
I skated until I was 13 then my mom sobered up and realized I was a boy.
Let's do this.
WlNSTON: You should not have said that.
- Don't.
- You're wearing roller skates.
- I'm telling you, man.
NlCK: Both of you.
Nothing's smart about what you guys are doing.
Why don't you both act like grown-ups?
No, no.
I need your help now.
Get in my car and come to the mall because I need to figure out what to buy Paul for You guys are all wearing the holiday gifts I gave you.
That is so sweet.
I need to take a picture.
- Jess, don't take a photo now.
- So cute.
NlCK: Don't do the photo.
No pictures.
- So cute.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Why can't you figure out what to get Paul?
I don't know.
We've only been going out for, like, a month so not something fancy.
Do I get him a gag gift or do I get him something sweet?
I don't know.
You gotta figure out what you feel about him get a gift that reflects it.
That's the move.
My initial thought was to get him a gift certificate for piping hot sex.
You're being serious?
I don't want him to think I'm using him for his body.
I'm sure he'd be okay with that.
"Nerdy weird sex that works for both of us".
- Give it back.
- Amazing.
I'm gonna keep this.
Cash this in one night and get some weird nerd sex with it.
Oh, my God, thank you.
- I know what I'm getting my mom.
- Oh, my God, Nick.
NlCK: This goes right to my mom.
Why do we have to go to this office party tonight?
It's the last night before you guys go home to your families.
We gotta blow this thing out.
It'll be a good opportunity for you to do networking.
Help with the job search.
Everybody's hitting the nog, having a good time, letting loose.
You swoop in there and then boom, new job, man.
That's how things work.
Benjamins in your pocket, la pensione Iittle four-to-the-oh- to-the-one-to-the-kay.
You're making me want to stay broke.
So, what'd you get Paul?
I'm not telling you but, um, I'll give you a hint.
It's fuzzy.
I hope you didn't listen to Nick.
He's the worst gift giver ever.
You're welcome.
- Where are we, Jess?
We are on Candy Cane Lane.
At night, the whole block lights up with Christmas decorations.
It's so beautiful.
- Oh, my God, it's so beautiful.
- What fun, what wonderful fun.
Okay, whatever.
We have to come back later.
You'll see what I'm talking about.
Oh, no, we have to go straight from the party to the airport.
- Oh.
- Yes, I've missed my flight four years in a row.
If I miss it this year, my mom's gonna kill me.
- Schmidt, it's a menorah for you.
- Menorah.
Oh, a menorah.
Judaism, son.
SCHMlDT: Hey, hi.
You look awesome.
It's a before and after for a Bolivian diet pill.
El Glatrax?
I've taken that.
- I'm "before".
- Sure, you are, look at that.
So you said you wanted to see me for something?
Yes, I brought you a gift.
I hope you appreciate I have kept eye contact with you whole time and made no reference that you are naked.
- Very proud of you, Schmidt.
Hey.
Hey.
- Lot of tongue.
- You done with her hair?
No, I'm not the hair guy.
Oh, no, no, this is my very good friend Schmidt and he just came by to bring me a gift, so It's perfume.
Why does it say "Cecilia Number 5"?
Actually, it says that because, you know, heh, I made it specifically for you.
Found a place on 3rd Street where you design your perfume.
Base notes of cocoa because of your brown-ness.
Sea salt because it kind of sounds like Cece.
Uh, and sandalwood.
Sandalwood, always up to no good.
- That's, um - Ha, ha.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
- Thanks.
- Neat.
Let's get back to work.
Yeah, okay.
Um - I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll see you there.
- We'll do that.
- Three, two, one.
- Three, two, one.
Go.
- Envelope.
- Festive bag.
I was afraid you were gonna get me jewelry, so - Oh, no.
- What is it?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, two tickets to Vienna and passes to the Salzburg Music Festival?
That's, like, incredible.
- You're gonna love it.
- I'm speechless.
And, um, all I got you was "Anatomically correct heart of a 50-year-old nonsmoker".
- Ha-ha-ha.
- You know what?
Normally I'm like really good at giving gifts and I thought that was romantic but it's just so creepy.
I'm sorry, I have to get you something better.
No, it's great, I love it.
It's funny and quirky and so sweet.
It's like you.
That's why I love it.
I love it.
Thank you, I love it.
I I love you.
Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
- You're welcome.
NlCK: All dressed up.
What, are you in The Temptations tonight?
Heh.
- That's so cute, Nick you're intimidated by my style.
But one of us is walking out of here with a job.
- Where you going?
- You wore my present.
- I did.
Thank you, I love it.
- Yay!
She's seen it now so maybe you can take it off.
- You look like a man.
I know, right?
Good humor and fun, God forbid.
WlNSTON: Is that Schmidt?
NlCK: Oh.
- What the?
- Hey, guys.
Whoa, whoa.
Schmidt, Santa voice.
This isn't temple.
Ho, ho, ho.
Are those my shorts?
NlCK: Hey, what's wrong, Jess?
- Hey, Nick.
- Paul told me he loved me.
- Hm.
And I couldn't say it back so l, um, said thank you which was horrible.
I don't know what to do because I am always the one who loves more.
That's my thing.
One time I went on a date and by 11 p.m I gave the guy my ATM code.
- What is your ATM code?
- Four-two Very funny.
Very good try but no.
Not a try, I got it.
If you don't have feelings for Paul, you tell him.
I can't do that to someone on Christmas.
And then it's New Year's.
Then it's gonna be Valentine's Day and then, whoa, it's Presidents' Day.
Hard to argue with that logic, but just tell him.
Don't lead him on, you'll just hurt him more.
Okay.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna tell him.
NlCK: You are?
- Yeah.
Hey, what are you doing in here?
Kyle's being a jerk.
- What are you doing in here?
- Eating cookies, avoiding confrontation.
Remember when Christmas was fun and all I had to worry about was my drunk uncle?
- Yes, Uncle Pardeep.
- Heh.
- He thought I was a boy.
- Such a weirdo.
Okay.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
- How you doing, Paul?
- Good.
- Has Jess not talked to you?
- Oh, yeah, no, we talked.
- She did, okay.
- Yeah, no Yeah, it's hard, you know, it's really tricky.
It's like she doesn't love you right now, Paul.
But that's not to say she might not fall in love later.
That's the positive way of looking at it but it's hard, man, believe me.
We talked about how we might have to drive you to the airport because you're gonna miss your flight.
Yeah.
That was probably all you guys talked about, so I'm joking.
- Wait a minute.
- Because she-- Yeah, I know, guess what, Paul.
Don't even think right now.
I'm drunk.
- Did Jess tell you that she doesn't love me?
- I'm so drunk.
No, shut up, you goofball.
I'm-- This conversation didn't happen.
Did Jess tell you she doesn't love me?
Joke.
But he's the best guy, Cece.
Maybe I should just make it work.
Yeah, no, Jess, you can't just dive into something like this right now.
Yeah, I just wish I could stay in this bathroom all night.
Me too.
Whew, that eggnog is deadly.
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we do.
I should just put it off till later, after the holidays.
- You coming?
- Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.
- Kyle wants to go to this party.
- Ugh, Kyle is the living worst.
Yeah, I know.
- Did he even get you a gift?
No.
Four calling birds Three French hens Two turtledoves And a partridge in a pear tree   Who wants to sit at a desk all day?
Not me, I don't wanna have to do that.
I don't want to call Wednesday "hump day".
I don't even know how to network.
So, what's your deal, man?
Why are you sitting here by yourself?
- Mommy won't let me sit in Santa's lap.
- Heh.
You have a smart mommy.
I'm the genius who brought my kid to a Christmas party.
Looking forward to years of therapy over Dirty Santa.
I can't believe he's talking.
He doesn't like anyone.
- I don't like anyone.
- But we're really working on that.
No, she's working on that.
WlNSTON: My man.
You think it's fun?
Do it.
I do think it's fun.
Do it then.
Do it.
Okay.
- What are you doing, Santa?
- I have a really bad case of Santa lap.
- Mm.
- The entire marketing department is wearing wool.
It's not good down there.
- Well, get back to work soon.
Boom!
- Ow.
Why would you?
There are so many bobby pins up there.
Everything's attached.
- Does she always talk to you like that?
- Kind of.
- You like dressing up like Santa?
- Sexy Santa.
No.
The truth is, no, I don't.
You don't deserve to be treated like that.
You gotta tell her no.
Otherwise, all she'll do is see you as a pretty face and a hot body.
- I'm sorry, what was that?
- You have a pretty face.
No, the second part.
I'd like you to say it in an accent but make direct eye contact.
Schmidt, do not push your luck with me.
- What's that smell?
- That's your perfume.
- You wore it?
- Yeah, and it smells terrible.
Ha.
It does smell terrible.
It's like a dirty dish towel.
KlM: Santa voice!
- Please just tell me what she said.
- She said the sex is really great.
But she doesn't want to jump into anything.
- Why am I talking about this?
- My God, the sex is great, it's amazing.
We had amazing sex this morning and then we ate taro chips.
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.
I I feel like such a terrible guy for saying that to you, man.
- Oh, my God.
- You're a good guy, Genzlinger.
Hey, man, just let it go.
You know what I mean?
- Just let it brush off your shoulders, dude.
Oh.
NlCK: What has happened to my life?
- Hey.
- Why are you guys hugging?
- Just guy-talking.
- Yeah.
Yeah?
NlCK: Everything's fine.
Just talking.
- We're just talking.
About, uh, how moved we are by jazz music.
That's a lie.
- I told him you didn't love him, Jess.
- What?
- Because-- - He said it nicely.
Are you kidding me?
It's not your information to share.
NlCK: I regret it.
- Not your information.
- Why would you do that?
- You guys have a lot to do.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
- Please, this is my nightmare!
Winston!
Schmidt!
Help me!
Paul, I really care about you.
I think I just feel really overwhelmed.
Yeah.
- Yeah, I know, Nicholas told me.
NlCK: Damn it.
Hey, guys, just pretend I'm not here and do whatever you guys are doing.
I'm not here.
I'm not even listening.
This is my nightmare.
I knew you were getting out of a long relationship.
You told me all about Spencer.
I thought we were feeling the same things.
- You seemed like you were.
- I was.
I just I feel like maybe you were feeling them a little bit more than me.
Nick!
You started this.
Sit down and be quiet!
I just, I got really hurt and I'm trying really hard not to get hurt again.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Oh.
Oh.
I am so sorry.
This is as rude as it gets.
It is my mom, though.
Hey, Ma.
How you doing?
I can't talk right now.
I'm in a real weird situation.
No, Ma, I'm not high, I'm done with that phase.
I promise you I won't miss my flight.
Okay.
I love you, Mama.
Bye.
- You done?
- Mm-hm.
Can we just Can we just keep going but take it a little bit slow?
I don't know if I can do that.
I don't know how with you.
- It's just not how I feel.
- All she's asking is slow it down a bit.
- Nick.
- Yeah.
All right, everybody leave the room.
I need to talk to Kim.
Okay, you know what?
Actually, stay, this'll be good for you guys to hear too.
- Why-- Don't-- I just told you to stay.
- There are two hours left in this party.
- What are you doing, Santa?
- I'm not gonna be Sexy Santa anymore.
It's over.
Santa's dead.
I killed him.
Oh, my God.
No, don't worry, that's just Gina's cowardly son.
- He is a scream machine.
- Kim, I'm not a sex object, all right?
I'm your employee.
And I work harder than anyone.
- I'm the first one to show up every morning.
- No, you're not.
- There's never a parking space.
- Because everyone's already here.
You're so off topic.
You're missing the point.
- You need to take me seriously, Kim.
- That mean no more Sexy Easter Bunny?
- No Sexy Easter Bunny.
- What about, uh, Cinco de Sexy?
- No Cinco de Sexy.
- And no Sexy Martin Luther King?
I can never get the voice, Never felt like I had the authority-- I can't believe it took you five years to say that.
Well, I guess I'm gonna have to be Sexy Santa next year.
Think I just got a jingle bell rock.
You know what I mean?
- That is so inappropriate.
- I get it, so you can dish it out but you can't take it.
Yeah, how's that feel, Kim?
I like it.
Both these machines need toner.
They need-- I'm gonna put the toner in the machine.
Mrs. Miller, I told you, I will get Nick to his flight on time.
No worries.
I can't find Elvin.
I looked everywhere.
I have no idea.
Uh, you know what?
I gotta go.
Um, he's around somewhere.
We'll find him.
GlNA: Elvin!
- You go that way, I'll go that way.
This is Schmidt's fault.
GlNA: Elvin?
I'm sorry, Jess, I just, I don't wanna slow down with you.
It's just not natural.
So if you need to, then I don't think I can do this anymore.
Okay.
Come on, Paul!
- It's Christmas.
Don't break up with her.
- It's okay, Nick.
It's okay.
Hey, have you guys seen a little kid running around here?
Thank you.
O come all ye faithful Joyful and triumphant Aha.
I see you found Santa's house.
I was looking for it.
- The man with no shirt killed Santa.
- Oh, heh, you mean Schmidt.
- He was just dressing up like Santa.
- Then why didn't he have a shirt?
We ask ourselves that question every single day.
Is it because he's a D-bag?
Mommy says he's a D-bag.
You know something?
You're a really smart kid.
And for that, Santa's gonna bring you extra presents this year.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Thank you, LeBron.
- Okay, cool, I'll be LeBron.
- You found him!
WlNSTON: Yeah.
- Hi!
-  Extra gifts this year.
- You're really good at this.
Seriously.
If you ever want to hang out with Elvin again I will pay you a lot of money.
Let's go.
- A lot.
-  Thank you.
Like, whatever you're thinking, add money to that because that's what l-- Like, a lot.
- Bye, Elvin.
- Bye, LeBron.
Yep.
What up, Mrs. Miller?
Yes.
We're on our way right now so just go back to sleep.
We're getting Nick to the airport.
WlNSTON: What airline has flights that leave at 4 a.m.?
NlCK: Oh, the kind that I can afford.
- What's that smell?
- It's nothing.
- That's my perfume.
- Oh, God, that is bad.
But the weird kind of bad that makes you want to smell it again.
- There's something we gotta do.
Sorry.
SCHMlDT: What are you doing, man?
You're going in the wrong direction!
WlNSTON: You do this every single year, man!
- I think we're too late, Nick.
- This was supposed to be your gift, Jess.
I screwed it up.
I'm sorry.
Candy Cane Lane is shut down.
Should've got her perfume, man.
Nice, Schmidt.
- Man.
- Yeah.
I have the worst timing.
I'm always in the wrong place at the wrong time.
- Let's go.
We should go.
- No, we don't-- Jess, no.
It's Christmas.
It's our Christmas.
We came here to see the lights.
Well, what are we gonna do?
WlNSTON: Yeah, what are you doing?
What are you doing?
WlNSTON: Come on.
- Why would they turn them off?
- lt doesn't make sense to me.
WlNSTON: Nick, we don't got time for this.
- Excuse me, guys?
- Oh, hell, no.
We got a girl out here who'd really like to see the lights!
Sorry to wake you up!
This is rude!
Make it the Candy Cane Lane or whatever!
You spend all this time to show off and do it, so show off, you got an audience!
- This whole neighborhood is ridiculous!
- Heh, heh.
You all show off so turn on the lights!
Just go in the shed or whatever and turn your damn lights on, you show-offs!
- Turn on your lights!
NlCK: Turn on the lights!
Flip the switch!
SCHMlDT: Turn on your lights!
NlCK: Turn them on!
WlNSTON: Hey!
Turn on your lights!
- Turn on your lights!
NlCK: Turn on your lights!
- Turn on your lights!
SCHMlDT: Turn on your lights!
Turn on the lights, everybody!
NlCK: Turn on the lights!
Turn on your lights.
That snowman is dead.
- Turn on the lights, everybody!
- You got too much time on your hands.
Oh, my God!
And mistletoe And presents on the tree Oh, my God!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
Christmas Eve will find me WlNSTON: It's good!
- Merry Christmas.
- Ha, ha.
Merry Christmas, boys.
- Merry Christmas, everyone!
Merry Hanukkah!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Now stop yelling before I call the cops!
Oh, my God.
- Appreciate it.
- Merry Christmas, buddy.
Candy Cane Lane is the crème de la crème of decorated streets.
Amazing.
- Hey, Ma!
How are you?
Yeah.
No, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
No.
Ma, stop yelling at me, please stop yelling.
Ma, I'm not high!
Stop yelling!
I'm driving a car.
I can't talk.
Hey, remember Winston?
Winston, it's my ma.
Talk to her.
WlNSTON: Hey, what up, Mrs. Miller?
You know, I wrote a poem about you.
You wanna hear it?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Fifty dollars in the douche bag jar?
WlNSTON: Absolutely.
NlCK: Absolutely.
- Why so much?
I feel like it should be more in the 100, 200 range - so that's a discount.
- Think about what you did, Schmidt.
I lost it.
I've lost the party bus.
- The party bus for your birthday party?
SCHMlDT: Yeah.
Apparently, my business isn't as important as Frankie Muniz's.
They canceled.
There's nothing I can do.
The party's off.
You should torch them on Yelp.
I can do it.
I have an account under the name Fantastic Jacques.
He's a French diplomat with very little patience.
Or you could just get another bus.
In two days?
Heh.
Okay.
Yeah, sure, Winston.
Why don't I just go down to the party bus store where all the party buses have a state-of-the-art sound system a stripper pole, a love grotto and a steering wheel in the shape of a boob.
You honk the nipple.
It's pretty awesome.
Just have the party at a bar.
Nick, this is it.
This is my 29th birthday party.
This is the year.
After this, I don't know, it's just Just all darkness.
Was he crying a little?
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess.
Too hot, I'm too cold Hey, I just came to make sure you're okay.
I'm not okay, Jess.
I had to cancel my birthday party.
It's social suicide.
I can feel my "it" factor going away.
- What am I gonna tell Benjamin?
- Why are you worried about Benjamin?
- He's your friend.
- We have a very weird girl-style friendship where we kind of hate each other.
We're "bronemies".
He's my "fremesis".
I'm so confused right now.
Okay, Benjamin and l were suitemates in college.
I can't wait to get to L.A. We're gonna have so much sex.
In the morning, in the afternoon, at bedtime.
Mm, peanuts.
I'm telling you, I'm gonna run that town one day.
You'll see.
I'm gonna write you a check right now for a hundred million.
- Damn, dude.
- And this is a real check.
You can cash it when I'm rich and awesome.
Give me about four years.
Do the song.
We built this Schmidty We built this Schmidty On Tootsie Rolls  If it wasn't for Benjamin, I never would have become a Los Angeles baller.
Holla.
I changed everything about myself, Jess.
I lost all the weight, I changed my clothes.
I even dropped my voice half an octave but it wasn't enough.
I guess I'll just never be cool enough, Jess.
get sidetracked Okay, I've got it.
We are gonna throw Schmidt a birthday party.
- No.
- Yes, it's his 29th birthday and we care.
Schmidt's world is different than ours.
They speak a different language.
They shorten every word to one syllable.
Okay, he once called an oven an "ovs".
He calls an airport "airp".
- He called ketchup "ketch".
- Last month he went to a party called "Bros Before Ho's on the Moon".
What does that even mean?
The dress code was "yacht flair".
- What?
- Schmidt has a friend who legally - changed his name to Doinit.
- Ted Doinit.
Just one word: Doinit.
You are not emotionally, mentally and spiritually prepared to throw these D-bags a party.
I'm gonna do some research.
Actually, I'm sorry, I do have to go.
Where you going?
Why you wearing - jury-duty pants?
- I'm not, man, I'm just-- Mumble, mumble.
Come on, it's a lawyer party, it's a classic fifth date.
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna apologize.
- Nothing to apologize for.
I owe you nothing.
- I'm having a fun time.
I love wearing a Bill Cosby sweater in front of lawyers younger than me.
Hello, I'm Bill Cosby.
Do you like pudding?
My son's name is Theo and his best friend is Cockroach.
- That supposed to be Cosby?
-  As good as I can do.
- Let's see yours.
- How he sounds?
I want to get some more pudding.
That's the worst Bill Co-- How about this?
I got a daughter named Rudy Huxtable, and she's the cutest of all my daughters.
I'm really glad that you're here with me.
Yeah, I'm happy you let me be here.
No, I really am because I gotta kiss all the asses of these 24-year-old law students to try to get them to work here.
- I went to law school.
- You went to law school?
Yes.
I quit.
- Quit law school, why?
- Yes.
Because I realized I hated lawyers.
He says to the lawyer.
And for some reason, I find you ridiculously attractive for saying that.
Why don't you kiss my ass, then?
Look, Julia, I got turned around.
I thought we were doing a flirty-- I'm just kidding.
I do want to do that.
Oh, you would?
We can make that happen.
- Great.
- Let's go.
- Let's go to your place.
- Go to your place.
Do you mind?
Are you married or what?
No, no, no.
I'm not married.
I am the opposite of married.
Before you, there was nothing.
I've got, like, no girls on the horizon.
In a hot way.
Then why don't you ever invite me to your place?
Or, like, tell me all that much about yourself?
It's weird.
I don't even know where you live.
I'm 30 years old, and I live in a loft with three roommates.
In a hot way.
But maybe you can kiss my butt when I talk like Bill Cosby.
- All right, let's go.
Uh-huh.
- ls that gonna work?
Weird stuff works with you.
Hi, yes, I'd like to order a last-minute stripper.
Oh, um, preferably of Asian heritage.
Very bendy, with a heart of gold.
And a crotch of gold.
Hmm?
Yeah, I'll hold.
- Hey, this is Julia.
- Hi.
- We're just saying hi.
- Nice to meet you.
Welcome to our home.
One second.
We're doing a surprise party for Schmidt.
- Who is that?
- I didn't tell you?
- No.
- Heh.
That's our other roommate.
- Our other roommate.
- You should come Saturday.
- Yes.
JULlA: Cool.
Yeah.
- Stay as far from that party as possible.
- ls it a presents thing or more like a donations-to-charity situation?
No?
- Just bring yourself.
- You want to head to my room?
Give you the rest of the tour.
- Great, yeah.
- Great.
Bye.
NlCK: Bye.
Okay, cool.
- Hey, Winston, why'd you do that?
- Are you hiding her from us?
Are you ashamed of your friends?
A hundred percent.
You're not my friend now.
You're my enemy.
- Give me a kiss.
NlCK: My enemy.
NlCK: No, that's the problem.
- Give me a kiss.
Thank you, Ms. Phatbooty, you're the best.
Yes, I just hired my first stripper.
Anything else I should get?
Do you like jazz cigarettes?
Hi, Tanya.
Patti told me that-- Patti told you to break in my office to look for drugs?
Hey, J. K. kidding.
J. K. kidding.
You can do whatever you want.
I didn't know you liked to shop at the confiscation station.
So, what are you looking for?
Grass?
- I can do locker search on Monday.
- Monday is too late because Oh.
So, what you got cooking this weekend?
You have to tell me.
I'm your boss.
What is it?
Listing?
Paperless Post?
I'm free Friday.
But I can also make Saturday or Sunday work.
What are you doing?
I'm making an egg-yellows omelet.
The shallots and gouda are gonna congeal.
- I can't-- What is this?
Happy birthday!
- It's a party bus.
- I'm so excited.
Whoa, Jess, you really did all this for me?
Okay, so over here is kosher yogurt and honey.
- Kosher yog?
- We got some condoms over here.
- Small, large, whatever.
- I would use-- I don't wanna know.
And the R-rated section in the back with the stripper pole.
It's normally used for stability.
But tonight, it's gonna be used for 50-dollars' worth of semi-nudity.
Coincidentally, I'm wearing my lap dance pants.
- This is, like, your world, huh?
- No.
It is.
It's you in your natural habitat.
It's fascinating.
I'm here for Schmidt.
I don't know these people.
- Nicholas.
What's up, N-word?
- Don't call me "N-word".
- I don't know this guy.
- How's your family in Chicago?
They're really good, thanks for asking.
They're all healthy.
Oh, look at this big old pile of birthday Schmidt.
Mind if I get a ride on your school bus?
I don't wanna be late for first period.
Why you got to do me like that, Benjamin?
- What's up, boys?
- What up?
Sing us your birthday song.
- Oh, you have a birthday song?
- All right, guys, come on.
Sing it, come on.
We built this Schmidty - We built this Schmidty - We built this Schmidty - On rock-- - On Tootsie Rolls  Is that the lyric?
- We used to make him sing that because he was fat.
- You know I'm just playing at you.
- Yeah, hilarity, my man.
Hilarity.
BENJAMlN: Come on, man.
- You really live with that guy, huh?
- Yeah, I really do.
Does he, like, tuck his shiny jeans into boots when he goes out at night?
The truth is I met Schmidt a long time ago when we were in college and he was this sweet, chubby communications major - who wore cargo shorts-- - I'm just messing with you.
Seriously, I think all of your friends seem completely awesome and nice and fun, so relax.
You don't have to say that.
You can tease them.
- I don't wanna tease them.
- I tease them.
Schmidt's a d-bag.
You know, not in a bad way.
And Jess is a total nut.
And Winston is like this competitive maniac who loves Sister, Sister and he's afraid of thunder.
I'm the voice of-- - He's behind you.
- Right now he is?
Currently.
- And he's also one of my best friends.
- Oh, no, keep going.
- You wanna go on the bus?
- Yeah, let's go on the bus.
I'm sorry, man, I was just saying that to show off for her.
- I am bringing you down.
Heh, heh.
- Don't bring me down.
- Bro juice?
- Vodka pom, right?
- Winston said it was a tradish.
- Look, Benjamin's smiling.
- Jess, you did so good.
MARTlN: This stripper pole weight-bearing?
Looks like some pretty shoddy workmanship on the cap flange.
- Can I help you?
- Martin Fuller.
Grindpals.com.
Hi, I'm Jessica Day.
I spoke with your supervisor on the telephone.
Oh, are you bringing the stripper?
Because I'd really like to see her jugs first.
You know, just so I do right by my bro.
We have a little miscommunicado.
Did you make the call?
Because if they hear a woman's voice, then they send me.
I'm your stripper, folks.
Hey, need to clear this aisle.
I gotta have perimeter--  No.
- Please, you can't-- - Are you the birthday boy?
SCHMlDT: I am.
You are gonna love it.
I do wet-towel tricks.
- No, he does not like-- - I don't judge.
I just wanna have fun.
- Sir, you are not gonna-- - I don't want to be rude, but times are hard.
It is Saturday night, so if I get hired to take my clothes off I'm gonna get naked.
So I'll put my bag down - and I'll take my pants off.
- No, I'll handle this.
Fix it.
Hey.
Hey.
Mr. Fuller.
Mr. Fuller.
Mr. Fuller?
It's getting a little nippy out.
Not a good time to start turtling.
Come on out.
- Jess, make it stop.
- I'm gonna pay you $50 to never show us your penis.
What about tips?
I make my living on tips.
Well, can you do anything else for money?
I'm a baritone at my gospel choir at First Presbyterian.
Whoo!
Everybody.
Hey.
Welcome to Schmidt's 29th!
Safety is of the utmost importance so the person sitting next to you is gonna be your bus buddy.
Any time you're up and about, please wear one of these fashion helmets.
- And I brought drugs.
- Tanya has half a pot cookie so maybe she'll share if you're lucky.
Okay, everybody have fun!
Martin, sing us out.
Oh, when he comes And when he comes - He's gonna come for you - No stripping.
Oh, sweet salvation Oh, when he comes Fifty dollars.
I've never put $50 in the douchebag jar.
Well, that's really impressive, Schmidt, considering Someone's personalized condoms just came in the mail.
Hey.
Jar.
Twenty dollars.
Winston, did you know that NWA didn't stand for "Never Walk Alone"?
Thirty dollars.
Jar.
- Hey, Nick.
- No!
Jar, Schmidt!
Jar!
For what?
Somehow, Schmidt, you've outdone yourself this time.
It was my birthday.
I was very drunk.
All right, everybody, I think we need to take shots.
A little bro-juice.
Shot for Benjamin.
- For Benjamin is the king.
- I'm the king!
No, I think we need to take a shot for Schmidt because he is the birthday boy.
- Bro juice!
Bro juice!
Bro juice!
- What's "bro juice"?
- I have no idea.
- Really?
Nick Miller invented bro juice on Schmidt's 22nd birthday.
- Remember that?
- Double deuce.
Bro juice!
Bro juice!
Get over here and sip on your bro juice!
Bro juice!
Bro juice!
All right, Schmidt.
This is not gonna be attractive.
- That's what I'm talking about.
WlNSTON: Yeah!
Oh, yeah!
NlCK: You know we're too old for this, don't you?
Oh, definitely.
Happy birthday, brother.
I love you.
- Yeah!
- Happy birthday, Schmidty!
Whoo!
- Bro juice!
- Bro juice!
When I say "Par," you say "Tay".
- Par.
Tay!
- Par.
Tay!
Holla!
Whoo!
- What am I doing?
- lt makes you think, huh?
Twenties, they're almost over, man.
It's crazy.
- Are you hitting that?
- Jess?
- No.
- Well, then I think I'll help myself.
To sex with your friend.
No, Benjamin, you can't.
Not with Jess.
Please don't.
I can.
I can, and I will.
Good evening, night owls.
It's about to get bubonic in here.
That's right.
We're going to The Plague.
Sorry.
It's just "Plague".
It's a discotheque.
We'll be going there next.
Whose list are you on?
Tristan's?
Isn't it just like a bar or something?
What do you pull down a year in the game?
Ever since I started doing full frontal, I pull down seven K a year, easy.
Why?
You interested in the life?
Me?
A male stripper?
Come on.
You're too kind.
But you know, theoretically, if I were to get into the game what are they looking for, in the gator department?
You know what I mean?
Or is it just moving so fast that it doesn't really matter?
It's all about storytelling, taking them on a journey.
Let me ask you some basics.
When you thrust what's your range of motion, side to side?
Go left, fight right.
What about your testicles?
Are they, more or less, symmetrical?
Size, yes.
- Location, no.
- What about your persona?
- Like, a fireman or a cop?
- I didn't ask you your character.
Your persona.
- I'm a Wolf-Hawk.
What are you?
- Luxury.
Dessert.
I'm a warrior poet, man.
That's it.
I got a number for you to call.
You ever hook up with the ladies?
It's ladies, like, one out of 10 times, at most.
- You're dancing for dudes?
- Yeah, I'm dancing for dudes.
All right, I'm sorry, okay?
You're so quiet.
- You're having a terrible time.
- Don't mean-- I'm probably just intimidated.
I'm sitting next to the inventor of bro juice.
- I get it, okay?
- That's-- I'm gonna brag about that.
I did.
I invented bro juice, okay?
And now you want-- You're done.
- What?
- When we get off the bus - it's over.
I blew it.
- Ridiculous.
I don't care about it.
I really don't.
Everyone's got embarrassing stuff.
- I have stuff that you don't know about.
- Like what?
Just don't lie to me about stuff, and we'll be fine.
Fine.
When I work out, which isn't often I listen to Huey Lewis.
It pumps me up.
Not ironically.
Wanna hear something else?
- Okay.
- I don't believe dinosaurs existed.
I don't believe it.
Wanna hear something else?
I think I'm good.
And I believe you, and I appreciate all of this truth-telling.
- I don't think you have stuff.
- All right.
You're just perfect.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
- Hey, scooch.
- Oh.
Okay.
Hi.
- So I texted Tristan.
- Oh.
Okay.
- He said he could get us into Plague.
Oh.
That's terrific.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Just you and me, of course.
So why don't you ditch that zero and get with the hero.
The hero is my penis.
Oh.
Uh - No.
BENJAMlN: Am I bad?
Hey, Benjamin, come on, just leave her alone, man.
Whatever.
Schmidt, your party slugs, bro.
- All right, you know what-- - Schmidt, this party is the worst.
Come on, man.
This party is badass, all right?
Don't act like I didn't see you over there eating all the charcut-- - The charcut-- - Charcuterie.
- Don't act like I didn't see you eating-- - Charcuterie.
WlNSTON: Charcuterie.
Know what, Curly?
You don't like the bus, then get off it, pal.
- Schmidty's birthday, bud.
- You guys suck.
Let me talk to him.
I'm a lawyer.
Can I just have a word?
Please.
- Why don't you say that one more time.
- Oh.
You guys suck--  Oh.
Look out!
Hold on!
Oh.
Is everyone okay?
- Yes.
No worries, Jess.
- ls everybody okay?
- I'm so sor-- - What are you, nuts?
- Oh, God.
BENJAMlN: Aah!
Who are you?
Ha, ha.
You like these?
A- boom!
Tanya, please stop flashing the driver.
Are you like the Bourne Identity person?
I've got these-- Like, these anger-management issues.
- Anger management?
- But I'm trying to fix it.
I go to all these class-- They're court-ordered classes.
- And what was, like, all this stuff?
- It's martial arts.
I started doing martial arts ironically, because I thought it would give me a little bit more Zen in my life.
You must be really freaked out right now.
- Yes, I am really freaked out.
- I'm so sorry.
I hate that I'm so turned on by your craziness-- - Go with it.
- I'm going with it.
- You guys cool waiting for the tow truck?
- Fine.
See you at the loft.
Bye, guys.
Happy birthday.
SCHMlDT: Thank you.
Bye, Julia.
Bye, Bro Juice.
- Thank you for that.
SCHMlDT: Bro J, my man.
So it's my birthday.
- Right now?
- Right now.
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Schmidt.
I'm 29, folks!
What's up?
Twenty-nine!
Twenty-nine!
Can you please not tell anybody I just did that?
That feels embarrassing.
You know what?
I don't care what people think.
Think I care too much about what people think?
- Maybe a little bit.
- Maybe.
Did you have fun tonight?
Because I know it was a little bit flawed.
Jess, are you kidding me?
Tonight was tens across the board.
- No splash.
- Ha, ha.
Good.
No, for real.
Nobody's ever done that for me before.
Anytime, Schmidt.
Anytime.
Schmidt, why are you looking at me like that?
Ooh.
Shh.
Because you had You had fuzz on your face.
- No, no, because I thought-- - Oh, my God.
- You had fuzz on-- A piece of-- - Jar.
Schmidt.
It was a piece of fuzz.
It was right there and just: - Just put it in the jar, Schmidt.
- Come on.
No excuses.
WlNSTON: You tried to kiss her.
- Okay.
For you guys.
NlCK: Okay.
Happy birthday.
- Twenty-nine!
- Ten more.
Sorry about that.
SCHMlDT: Ugh.
Frankie Muniz.
Ooh, Jess, I just found a Groupon for hypnosis lessons.
Think about what you can do with that.
- Sex stuff.
Jar.
- Guys, has anyone seen my good pea coat?
WlNSTON: Jar.
- Seen my sharkskin laptop sleeve?
NlCK: Jar!
Darn it.
Has anyone seen my croquet cleats?
Hey, Jess, have you seen my other timepiece?
I came up with the best name for an uncircumcised penis.
- Bishop in a turtleneck.
NlCK: Aah!
Jar.
Damn it!
I can't find my driving moccasins anywhere!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Your sheets are so soft.
They've actually been in my family for almost 40 years.
- Wow.
- lf these old things could talk, huh?
Ew.
- I was just trying to paint a picture.
- Read the room.
NlCK: Ha, ha.
- Jeez.
Hey, Julia.
- Hey.
It's so fun having another girl around here.
There are tampons hidden all over the apartment.
SCHMlDT: Aah!
Damp towel!
Damp!
-  Here we go.
SCHMlDT: It's like a really big Wet-Nap.
Feel like I'm being licked by a golden retriever.
Look at this bathroom.
There should not be two girls in this bathroom.
You're too humid.
You make everything damp.
Eighty percent of the products are yours.
Blah, blah, blah, yawn, yes.
I use sculpting chutney.
Once I'm done with my chutney, back in the row it goes.
- Hair everywhere - Hello.
the multicolored rubber bands.
I'm fine with it.
It's all okay with me.
A damp towel is where I draw the line.
Sorry, so, what are your thoughts on damp towels?
Oh, you better watch it, Nick's guest.
- Julia.
SCHMlDT: I know your name.
- Are you flexing right now?
- No.
NlCK: Hey.
- I'm gonna get ready in your room.
Sure.
Feeling weird in here?
Hey, Julia, I'll see you later tonight.
- Yeah.
See you later.
She's helping me get out of a traffic ticket.
Are you seriously using the girl I'm sleeping with for free legal advice?
I'm sorry, the girl you're sleeping with?
- You can't call her your girlfriend?
- We're not labeling it.
Oh, you're not labeling it - because you're too sophisticated.
- Don't do your sophisticated guy.
- Not how a sophisticated man dances.
-  How does he?
I'm too sophisticated I don't believe in labeling - You gotta get laid.
- You gotta get laid.
- Yeah.
- This is bad.
- Get out of here.
- Mm.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Maybe I should call Shelby.
I haven't seen her since I got back from Latvia.
We did have an amazing time together.
Whoo.
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.
All right, bye.
I'm gonna call her.
Yeah, over in Latvia they had this fermented milk stuff that they drink.
Whole country runs on the stuff.
Called:   was definitely one of my biggest endorsements.
I have a lot of endorsements, but that was my biggest amongst other endorsements that I had.
- Wow.
- So, um, your place or mine?
What are we laughing at?
How much I'm not going home with you tonight.
You show up after two years, out of the blue and all you do is talk about yourself.
You don't even let me get a word in edgewise.
Heh.
Why did you agree to let me take you out for drinks?
Winston, you took me out for a drink at the place where I work.
Here's your bill.
Thanks for the water.
Man, I told you to get yourself whatever you wanted.
You chose water.
Have a seat.
JULlA: Okay.
Let me get you a blanket.
- Why would I want a blanket right now?
- Just to get toasty.
JULlA: Oh.
Oh.
Would you like a cookie or a cupcake?
I made them.
Oh, no, I'm okay.
I'm not really a dessert person.
- I just don't eat it, usually.
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna put this, like, right here.
- Oh.
- I don't-- Okay.
- Just-- Just take me through what happened with the ticket.
- They got a photo of you?
-  At the scene of the crime.
- ls this it?
-  Yeah.
Okay.
Hmm.
This may actually be kind of hard to argue with.
There's actually more there than meets the eye.
Um, there was a bird, he's not in the shot, but he was injured and couldn't get out of the road, so I braked.
And I had to accelerate - out of the intersection.
- You missed your court date.
My ex-boyfriend failed to send it to me before the court date.
He doesn't believe in mail.
Has to do with his thoughts on government spending.
Now it's an $800 fine.
That's why I need, like, a really awesome lawyer, like you.
- So can you help me?
- I mean, I can try.
You never know.
A judge might buy into this whole thing, so What whole thing?
Your whole thing.
With the cupcakes and the braking for birds and bluebirds come and help me dress in the morning.
Oh, I didn't know I was doing a thing.
It's a great thing.
I mean, the big beautiful eyes.
Like a scared baby.
I'm sure that gets you out of all kinds of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, except my peripheral vision is, like, almost too good.
Hey, so living here, it's probably fun, right?
- Yeah.
- Like, lots of girls coming in and out of this place?
Schmidt is like Ellis lsland in the 1800s.
He accepts everyone.
Yeah, and Winston and Nick I probably shouldn't - Oh.
Yeah.
You don't have to-- - Plead the Fifth!
- No, that's not what-- Whoa.
- Objection!
- Nick, hey!
- Hey, Julia.
- You wanna hang out?
NlCK: Sure.
Jess, if you'll excuse us, Julia is about to be very disappointed.
Okay, so I will look at this stuff some more I'll call some people, see what I can do.
Here's your blankie back.
- Power blazer.
- Ha, ha.
Hey.
What's going on with the ticket?
She has a problem with me, Nick.
She doesn't like me.
- What?
- You don't understand - because you're a guy.
- She does not have a problem with you.
Nick, your girlfriend is not a dessert person.
Hmm.
- She said you have a whole thing?
- I'm sorry, she doesn't like desserts?
- Yeah.
- Where is she right now?
Look, I think I know what she meant.
I mean, you do like girly stuff.
It kind of freaked me out at first.
When I met you, you were wearing a hat made of ribbons.
My ribbon hat.
I love that hat.
Screw her.
And I'm gonna wear that ribbon hat.
- Go get it, right now.
Be right back.
NlCK: Whoa, there she is.
Where is this bitch?
I'm gonna smack the learning out of her mouth.
Okay, this is getting excessive, guys.
She's helping her get out of a ticket.
By being condescending and judgmental?
What did she say?
Ugh, just drop it, Nick.
Okay, what did Julia do wrong?
It's how girls fight sometimes.
A lot unsaid.
Like, one time, a girl said to me, "Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots".
- Ooh.
How did she say it?
- "Jess, you rock a lot of polka dots".
- That is diabolical.
- I'm really sorry.
Ruined our friendship.
I couldn't get over the incident.
Warning!
Spoiler alert.
Somebody unplugged my dehumidifier to plug in their flatiron.
I will be putting my dehumidifier and my towel in my room where nothing ever gets wet.
You know what, Jess?
Julia is one of those girls where she doesn't have a lot of girlfriends.
She thinks like a guy.
She doesn't play mind games.
- So blind!
NlCK: All I know is she's totally upfront with me.
No subtext, no codes.
So did she come right out and ask you if you were seeing other girls?
Because she asked me.
- She did?
- You didn't know that?
I thought you were upfront with one another.
I thought you guys told each other everything.
- Told him she didn't wanna "label" it.
- Oh.
I mean, that's a classic move, even in the lesbian community.
- What are we talking about?
- Did you just hear "lesbian community" - and come running out of your room?
- I did.
Um, question, for you.
This community you speak of do the ladies look, um, more like this one - or, you know, kind of Nickish?
- Ah, shut up, Schmidt.
I did date a woman who looked like Nick.
You did.
Felicia.
Why can't you just admit she's your girlfriend?
I just thought it was uncomplicated, and now I'm freaking out.
I'm not good at being a boyfriend.
I'm that guy that you find yourself spending more time with until you meet your husband.
All right.
So far, Nick Miller's list of fears is sharks, tap water, real relationships.
- And blueberries.
- Barkeep.
Get this man a drink.
Ladies, he hasn't had sex in four months.
Come and get it, ladies.
- I seriously hate you.
- Why?
- lt didn't go well with Shelby?
- I thought it would be easy.
You know?
Maybe I don't have game.
Maybe I never had game.
Maybe it's always been about basketball.
It's always been because you play basketball.
Are you just realizing you don't have game?
What is your secret?
How do normal guys get girls?
Let's not say normal.
Just say what it is: Average.
WlNSTON: You've had the most game.
For years now, you've been working with absolutely nothing.
- Good point.
- I've been working with nothing.
- Zilch.
NlCK: Right, I've got nothing.
Except this.
Oh, my God.
JULlO: Miller.
No Cocktail.
Sorry, Julio.
- Julia.
Hey, Julia.
- Hey.
Oh.
You guys are using names?
That's not too "labelly" for you?
JULlA: Hey.
- Hey, hey, Jules.
JULlA: Hey, hey.
- Thought I'd drop by and say hello.
- I didn't know we were doing drop-bys.
Uh Here's a scenario that's paid sexual dividends particularly in the Asian markets, and, Jess, you can back me up on this.
Inform her that you're an aerialist for the Cirque du Soleil.
Winston, just ask questions, pay attention to her, listen to her don't listen to him.
Oh, I don't take advice from Schmidt.
Never have, never will.
Ever.
So Jess told me what you asked her yesterday.
- What?
- That you asked if I was sleeping with other people.
- That is not even-- l-- What?
- I don't wanna play games.
That's not what happened.
I just said something to her because I was feeling kind of guilty because I'm, uh, dating other people.
I wanted to see if you were also dating other people.
NlCK: You're dating other people?
- Yeah, yeah.
No.
No, I'm seeing other people too.
Good.
Good.
I'm having sex all the time.
I'm like a mailman.
Except instead of mail, it's hot sex that I deliver.
I've had to start carrying, like, athletic shoes in my purse because I have to sprint from one sexual encounter to another.
Can't wear heels.
Well, I'm having sex right now.
Under the bar.
And she's on top.
So figure that out.
- Was that her?
NlCK: Yeah.
Then we're both doing the same thing.
- We're on the same page.
- No labels.
- Exactly what I want.
NlCK: It's my dream.
- Just gonna go to the bathroom quickly.
NlCK: Okay.
Great.
Will you turn around and face it?
So I hear I really made you think Hey, Julia?
Are you serious?
Did Nick say some stuff to you?
I'm sorry, I wanna explain-- Why would you tell him that I said that?
You know what that makes me look like?
- Um-- - I see what you're doing.
I know that I'm the mean lawyer girl who wears suits and works too much and you, you're the really fun teacher girl with all the colorful skirts and you bake things.
And eventually, Nick is gonna come to you and you'll tuck him in under his blankie and-- What is it with you and the blankie?
I never said the word blankie.
I don't talk like Teddy Ruxpin.
If I acted the way that you act when I was at work, nobody would listen to me.
Well, if I acted like you at work my students would turn in really weird, dark dioramas, so-- I don't like you.
And I don't want to be your friend, so - Fine.
- Can you leave, please?
Because I am about to start crying and you are the last person that I wanna cry in front of.
I wanna cry too, and where am I supposed to cry?
You can't monopolize the bathroom crying space.
Please go.
What are you doing, Jess?
Get out!
I'm sorry.
- Winston, what are you doing?
- Pah-pah-pah.
I have come here to listen to you.
Should I have interrupted you to tell you that?
Probably not.
So how are you?
Tell me about your life, and how is everything?
Winston, what am I supposed to do?
I was a booty call for two years and then I was nothing for two years.
You show up bragging after all this time like nothing has changed.
What do you want me to think?
That I'm an idiot.
And you know what?
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just that since I've stopped playing ball I realize I'm not that good at this.
And, quite frankly, you are way out of my league.
That is clear now.
But I do hope this is not the last time I see you but whatever you want, I'm cool with.
- I gotta get back to work.
WlNSTON: Yeah.
Yeah, I'll help you.
See?
- I'm the manager.
- Oh, you're the manager?
Yeah.
- Wow, that's amazing.
It's okay.
Case 73.
Mr. Sandoval.
Why, I see you have dressed for the occasion.
Oh, hi.
You didn't have to come.
I'm sure you're very busy.
- I said that I would be here, so I'm here.
- Don't worry.
I think I can handle it.
Let's just get this over with so we can get out of here.
Yes, sir.
You keep a dog on a leash.
Your Honor.
Your Honor.
Your Honor.
These are the facts.
Your Honor.
Case 74.
Jessica Day.
Yes, sir.
Yes, I'm present, sir.
Okay, you just have to enter the plea yourself, all right?
- And then I'll do the rest.
- I got it.
- So all you have to do is say-- - I got it.
Thank you.
- How do you plead?
- Guilty.
Great.
Pay your fine upstairs.
-  What?
Well, I guess we're never gonna know if the bird defense works.
Such a bummer too.
We have this pool at my office.
Okay.
Hey!
I got something to say to you, man.
What?
I brake for birds.
I rock a lot of polka dots.
I have touched glitter in the last 24 hours.
I spend my entire day talking to children.
And I find it fundamentally strange that you're not a dessert person.
That's just weird, and it freaks me out.
And I'm sorry I don't talk like Murphy Brown.
And I hate your pantsuit.
I wish it had ribbons on it or something to make it just slightly cuter.
And that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong.
- Okay.
- And I know you like Nick and I'm not trying to interfere but you should just talk to him about it.
JULlA: Are you done?
I am almost done.
I'm about to go and pay this $800 fine and my checks have baby farm animals on them, bitch.
JULlA: That's the wrong way.
- You moved.
- You remember my old place?
- The place in the 'hood?
- No.
Okay, it was 'hood-adjacent.
Ha, ha.
Yeah, whatever.
So, um, this was nice.
Yeah, it was.
- Wanna know what I want to do now?
- What?
Take you on a real date.
Why don't you call me?
Good night, Winston.
- Winston, what's happening?
- Huh?
Yeah, good night.
What is wrong with you, man?
You got no game.
That was so stupid.
Hey!
Anyone!
My towel!
Can someone please get my towel?
It's in my room next to my lrish walking cape.
The bigger towel.
Not-- Do not touch the small one.
Okay, I left my towel in my room.
Nobody look.
- Nobody look, yo.
Nobody look.
- We don't want to.
Seriously, no one is looking at-- ?
All right, forget it.
- Aah!
Damn it!
Oh, my God.
He's a natural blond.
What shape is that supposed to be shaved into?
- Think he's trying to force perspective.
- Ha, ha.
Very funny.
- I gotta get something off my chest.
Oh!
No, Schmidt, there is an apron right over there.
Go cover yourself.
- You are Jewish.
- You're making me gayer.
Are you gonna go on, like, a wet-towel rant?
No.
This is now a sex rant.
To wit, six months ago I thought getting a girl roommate meant sex all the time.
Definitely with her friends and probably with her.
Are there women here?
Yeah, sure, more than ever.
But you, not gonna happen.
You, I will never give up.
And you, well, you sample from the gumbo pot.
- Ha!
- I am in a damp bathroom full of naked women every day and I hate it.
It's like a nightmare.
I'm in a watermelon-themed apron with a A tampon?
Why would you need this for cooking?
I just had an idea.
Why don't we hang our towels on towel bars instead of hooks?
- And that'll make them dryer?
- That is the-- That is, uh-- That is a great idea.
Quick question for you.
As a lesbian gynecologist perhaps one of these days the two of us could sit down and talk about OSl.
- What is OSl?
- Our shared interest.
Schmidt, clothe yourself!
SCHMlDT: All right.
It was just a suggestion.
- Oh.
Hey.
- Hi.
Nick's not here.
That's okay.
Uh, because I came here to Well, I kind of came because I thought it would be good if you and l-- Hey, Jess, my hands are actually stuck in the yarn because-- Oh.
I didn't realize you had people over.
Sorry.
No, it's just crochet time.
Yeah.
- Nick's not here.
JULlA: No, I know.
Thanks.
I'll just come back later.
Hey, Julia?
Do you want to crochet with us?
I mean, growing up was brutal.
- I went to an all-girls school.
- Girls can be so mean to each other.
Yeah, Cece and I hid in the bathroom for four years.
This is really nice, guys.
Thank you for letting me join in.
It's totally relaxing.
Except that I don't know why if I put the fox through the cave it doesn't-- The yarn is broken.
I don't know why this is not turning into-- What you making?
A hat.
If you're making a hat for a baby, it is done.
Yeah.
Hey, Julia.
What are you doing here?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Okay.
Hey, Julia.
- Stop.
- There's something I need to say to you.
All right.
Then go ahead.
- Okay.
- Okay.
I'm gonna say it.
- Uh, okay, l-- - Just say it.
All right.
I wanted to say that I don't wanna date anybody else.
I just wanna date you.
Well, that's what I was gonna say to you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So, then, what does that mean?
You're, like, my boyfriend now?
- No, I'm not really into labels.
- Yeah, all right.
Boyfriend.
That's so lame.
You're totally gonna carry my books home from school.
I will if you wear my leatherman jacket.
- Letterman jacket.
- I'm sure it's a leatherman jacket.
- You letter-- - Leather sleeves the football guys wear?
I'm right.
I'm right.
I'm glad you pitched a fit, because my towel is very dry.
I didn't pitch a fit.
I just Damp!
Damn it!
Everybody, bathroom now!
What's up, Dad?
- What?
- ls someone playing a joke on me?
Honestly, why is my towel still damp?
Because it's not your towel.
It's my towel, Schmidt.
- It's not your towel.
Your towel's red.
NlCK: I'll tell you this I've never used that.
I do use that one every single day.
- Oh, God.
- This towel is so warm and fluffy.
Like it's been in the sun forever.
This means you two have been drying your junk - with the same towel.
- lntimate.
Are you out of your mind?
How do you think this is your towel?
Do you wash it?
No, I don't wash the towel.
The towel washes me.
Who washes a towel?
- Never-- ?
- You wash your towel?
- You never wash the towel?
NlCK: What am I gonna do?
- Wash the shower next?
- Ugh.
- Wash a bar of soap?
You gotta think, pal.
- I'm furious right now.
I get out of the shower, I'm clean as a damn baby - and I use the towel.
SCHMlDT: Let me ask you this.
- Have you been wearing my underpants?
- Sometimes.
Who cares?
- Ugh.
- You don't wear each other's underpants?
- You're lying.
WlNSTON: No.
We all wear each other's underwear.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hey, hey, hey, man, this is my spot.
I was here first.
- That's my space, huh?
- This isn't Europe.
Move.
Come on, Nick.
Maybe he's a really nice guy - who's just having a bad day.
- I don't care.
Get that piece of crap out of my space.
Don't-- - Come on.
Why don't you come here, take my pants off  Nick.
- and kiss my-- ?
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.
What do you got to say now?
Huh?
My God, it's like The Wire.
- He has a gun.
Stay down.
- Still think he's nice?
- What I thought.
Maybe no one's been nice to him, violence is his tool to express himself.
- Hi.
- Get down.
What are you doing?
Hi.
NlCK: Don't kill us.
- Don't use guns.
- Stop it.
Just stop it.
Just get down.
- Sorry.
Take the spot.
Be submissive.
Sir sorry about this guy.
- Don't apologize.
He's overreacting.
I'm overreacting?
He has a gun and you're dressed like a bull's-eye.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
I can't believe this is working.
- You out-crazied a man with a gun.
Sorry.
Have a good day.
See?
It worked.
You always see the worst in people.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Here we go again.
Another text message from work.
Look: "Tokyo call at 11 "?
Driving me crazy.
What is she trying to say?
I'm not an expert at your industry at all but sounds like there's a call.
From Tokyo.
Sometime today.
Oh, wait.
At 11.
You don't understand.
I've been getting a lot of mixed signals from my boss.
What is wrong with you?
The world is not out to seduce you.
"And bring me the budget reports"?
Why can't she just say what she wants?
What kind of sick game is she playing?
It's all in your head.
It's always in your head.
Non-fat vanilla latte.
We're not talking about coffee are we?
Three, please.
Are you sure you want me to stop at three?
I have a package for Schmidt.
Sir, I'm very flattered, but I must decline.
He said he had a package for Schmidt.
You're always starting fights with everyone.
- I mean, not everyone's out to get you.
- He had a gun, Jess.
He was literally out to get me.
Isn't Nick the most negative person you've ever met?
Absolutely, and you know what?
It all pools up in that sadness center below his belly.
He's not wrong, though.
His life is terrible.
You know what, Jess?
I guess I don't live in a world where I smile, and people do what I want them to do.
- You never smile.
- A smile is a sign of weakness.
Ow!
No.
All right, everybody relax.
Get out.
It's fixed.
Okay, Nick, I'm calling the landlord.
This is ridiculous.
Don't call the landlord.
We don't need him, and he's a jerk.
See, here's an example.
You never gave him the chance to show what a great guy he is.
- Jess.
He sucks.
- He's terrible.
Don't call the landlord, I'm serious.
Okay.
Hey, Kim, where should I put this budget report?
- On the desk.
- Yeah.
Okay.
I'll just Thanks.
Schmidt, my files need sorting.
Do it here so I can watch.
Okay.
So you want me to sort your files?
Is that right?
- What are you doing?
- What am l-- ?
Hmm?
Okay.
Because I got this one wet, I'm gonna I'm just gonna replace all of them.
Knock, knock.
Mr. Landlord?
Um I know you probably think cupcakes are totally lame.
I know I do so if you could do me a solid and take care of those extras?
Cool office.
I like your bucket of gasoline.
It's super practical.
What you got there?
Broom.
So I live in 4D.
There are a lot of real safety hazards in our loft.
Nothing a little landlording couldn't fix.
What do you say?
No.
That's a sweet picture.
How old are your kids?
I did that.
It's me and my ex-wife.
Okay, you know what?
My roommates are really scared of you, but you're good, and you don't want - four of us in a dangerous apartment.
- The four?
Apartment 4D, there's only supposed to be three people.
Oh.
Did I say four?
You know what?
I was counting myself twice.
It's so easy to do.
Big personality over here, so gonna go  Hey, guys.
I've got a fun exercise.
Take a moment and think back to a time when they did something stupid, how they were treated - and how they wish they were treated.
- What did you do, Jess?
Open up.
- Did you talk to the landlord?
- Little bit.
- Okay.
Guys, go.
SCHMlDT: Ginny.
Call me Ginny.
Ginny.
SCHMlDT: I'm Ginny.
Okay, go.
NlCK: Right there.
WlNSTON: Let's go.
Go.
Okay.
NlCK: This is what we trained for.
- Go.
All the way, all the way.
- Be careful with the duvet.
NlCK: Shut up, Schmidt.
I'm freaking out.
Oh, my God.
- Told you we didn't practice this enough.
Jess, close those up.
SCHMlDT: Oh, there goes the chinos.
Brad.
Coach.
-  Hello.
NlCK: Ginny.
SCHMlDT: I had such nice time visiting Los Angeles.
It's so many fancy people with their fancy lives.
Hollywood.
Goodbye.
- Bye, Ginny.
- Yeah, Ginny.
- Thank you.
Bye, Ginny.
NlCK: You're the best, Ginny.
SCHMlDT: Goodbye.
- I'll miss him.
- I love Ginny.
Someone told me you have four people living here.
That idiot probably doesn't know what she's talking about.
You don't want to go in the library.
Who left the library like this?
- Know what?
This is so embarrassing.
- You kidding me?
WlNSTON: Who left the library?
NlCK: Hey, hey, where you going, my man?
WlNSTON: This is a mess.
Oh.
Ha, ha.
Hello.
Train to Panama all sold out.
Must be the Mardi Gras.
Good God, what is this?
Why would you do this?
This was Schmidt's room.
He painted this.
It is a sexually-charged, zero-gravity tea ceremony.
Paint over it.
Or you pay for it.
Seems fair.
Who painted that?
- Giancarlo.
NlCK: Some creepo Schmidt was obsessed with.
He used to wear I suggest you paint it, and you paint it fast.
Have fun, buddy.
To be honest, I was expecting a lot worse, so just Four people is fine.
Just paint over the sex wall and don't bother me anymore.
- Hey, sir, wait.
- Jess, let-- Let him go.
I just want to apologize on behalf of all of us for lying about how many live here.
- Stop.
But while you're here might as well just fix a few things.
Please, Remy?
How did you know my name?
They call you?
I saw your tattoo that says, "Hello, My Name is Remy" and I just, I took a leap of faith.
Look, I know you're a good guy-- Okay, what do you want fixed?
Close your eyes and point at something.
Her.
Not you.
Schmidt?
Yeah.
- I need you to clean up my hard drive.
- Okay, want me to reformat first?
I said, I need you to clean up my hard drive.
I should have seen a divorce coming.
You know, we stopped doing the little things, like talking.
One day, we were humping.
Then everything changed.
We weren't humping.
- That must have been really hard.
- Ahem.
You know, it was what it was.
Come on, Remy.
- lt was hard.
- lt was hard.
All right, give it a shot.
Great.
Okay.
Oh.
Here, I'll help.
Get All right.
I'll brace, you pull back.
Okay.
Use your hips.
Okay.
Oh!
- That's good.
That's it?
Okay.
That'll do it.
Hey, Jess.
Can I talk to you for a minute alone?
So, what's up?
Ready to admit you were wrong?
"Hello.
My name is Nick, and I like eating crow".
- That man wants to sleep with you.
- He doesn't.
- Yes, he does.
- He was showing me-- Anytime a man shows how to do something from behind it's just an excuse for him to get really close and breathe on her neck.
- Watch any sports movie.
- That is not a thing.
You mind picking up that mug?
No, you're doing it all wrong.
Here, let me show you.
No, no.
I've been doing this for years.
The way to pick up a mug is like that.
You got to relax.
- Wasn't doing that.
- Exactly what he was doing.
- You see the worst in people.
- Because people are the worst.
Whoa.
Ha-ha.
Five bucks.
Look out, college.
Here I come.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's it.
People stink.
You must have been doing something.
Are you defending the man who pushed me into the bushes?
People can be good.
You just have to give them a chance.
Hey, little girl.
You like candy?
I sure do.
Great.
My nana made way too much.
Why can't you admit you were wrong?
I was nice, and now he's fixing our apartment.
I'm working up an appetite in there.
Boy, I hope you don't mind the smell of a real man in your room.
Let me know when you want to get started on that bed.
Okay.
He's turning my mattress.
Yeah.
This is so wonderful.
Oh, come on.
Don't you ever wear jeans?
You look like you should be distracting Bond at a baccarat table.
No, I'm gonna go meet Kyle.
Jess loaned me her seasickness bracelets.
Going to a party on Greg Kinnear's boat.
You're going to a party on Neptune's Folly?
Yeah, relax.
He's not going to be there.
I know, he's in Rio till the 16th.
Cece can I talk to you, as a?
As a woman?
All right, Schmidt.
Okay.
My boss and l, we're running a pre-sex marathon right now and I feel like we're stuck in mile 25.
I'm cramping.
My toenails are falling off, I'm peeing down my leg.
I can see the finish line, but I can't get there.
- I need to put one of these on.
- The problem is we don't talk.
I don't know what she's thinking.
Should I make a move or not?
Stop asking permission and go get it.
That's what I would want.
There's nothing less sexy than a dude asking if he can kiss you.
Nothing?
What if I ate my own hair and pooped out a wig?
What if I called my mom after sex to describe it to her?
What if I had a croissant blog?
- Two of these now.
NlCK: We're the best.
Hey, Bob Ross, how's painting going?
Going absolutely fantastic, Schmidt because everything is easy "when you are a battleship, invading the Bay of Success".
- What?
WlNSTON: I have here Schmidt's New Year's resolutions from 2007.
- Please, read on.
NlCK: Read my favorite one.
"Stop pursuing Caroline.
She's Nick's girl.
- Deal with it".
- Deal with it.
She's my girl.
- Where'd you find that?
- Do not stop reading this.
I was very young.
And drunk.
Were you too drunk to "begin the search for the cocoon - Cocoon.
Heh, heh.
- that will release your butterfly"?
No, it does not say that one.
- Number three.
Come on.
Ha-ha.
- Why are you doing this?
- I just got bored painting over your interplanetary ass dojo.
This is my favorite.
"Find out where Winston gets his sparkle and then steal it".
NlCK: Steal - You were gonna steal my sparkle?
SCHMlDT: Give me that.
The funniest thing just happened.
I was watching Remy fix the sink, and I got totally soaked.
You were so wet.
Man overboard.
So I invited Remy over for dinner to thank him for all the stuff he's been doing around the apartment.
Who's in?
- I gotta - I got a boat, so So I guess it'll just be me and Jess.
Uh, heh, heh.
Oh, no, Remy.
I changed my mind, I'll be there.
Just watching you.
Remy brought a bottle of this.
I ferment things in the basement.
I also make cheese.
- You're not drinking that, Jess.
- Yes, I am, Remy made it.
- Ahh.
- Think you can handle some, Nick?
I'm okay.
Need to stay sober to fight you.
Nick, be nice.
How hard could it be to just open yourself up a little bit?
Dip your toe in the pool of possibilities.
Yeah, Nick.
Dip your toe.
You guys have a lot in common.
Nick went through a breakup that was really hard.
- Schmidt said your mom had to fly out.
- That was a scheduled trip.
Did you smell your girl on your sheets for months until they were too soaked through with your own sweat and tears?
No.
Did you punch out all the windows until you hit the wall and broke your hand?
Did you go out, looking for companionship a little human warmth only to come to in the woods covered in animal blood?
In my own way.
Come here, man.
It's gonna be okay.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I'll just go home and open a bottle of wine.
Yeah, I'll probably just do the same.
I want you now.
- Finally.
- Yeah.
SCHMlDT: No, no, no, she wanted me to-- - Oh - No, no.
My God.
- Stop hitting him.
SCHMlDT: She wanted-- Consensual.
Tap out.
Ow.
Tap out.
Oh, man, tonight is just I I I honestly didn't know if I'd ever enjoy myself again.
So thanks.
Bathroom break.
Ahem.
See?
I was right.
- What do you mean?
- You're wrong.
He's buttering me up so he can move in on you?
- Why can't you admit you were wrong?
- How have you lived on your own?
There's no part of that man wants to sleep with me.
NlCK: He's been creeping on you.
No, he hasn't.
NlCK: Open your eyes, like, I'm worried--  No.
Oh.
Hey, Remy, what happened to your pants?
I've never done a threesome.
That's what we're doing here, right?
This I did not expect.
I love watching you be wrong, Jess.
I might've been a bit off about Remy but people are good, and I'm not wrong about that.
- People are jerks.
- He is hurting from his divorce-- Are you still making excuses for this guy?
Look, if you feel so bad, then just get in there.
Just dip your toe into the pool of possibility.
Hey, Remy, let's get weird and toss that ball around, huh?
So turned on.
Okay, you would have a threesome with that man to get me to admit I'm wrong?
I think we could do a lot worse than Remy.
He's got strong arms.
Let's have a threesome.
All right, so a ménage à trois is about three of us.
- Sure.
- Trois "ménage-ing" fully.
Okay.
This is happening with this guy.
This is happening right now, Jess.
- Yeah.
- So it's gonna get even more uncomfortable.
We have to keep talking with each other.
Around and communicating.
Let's get some relax music going.
- Great idea.
Thank you.
- Okay?
All right.
JESS : Why can't you admit he's a good guy?
We're about to have a ménage a trois because you won't admit you're wrong.
I'm just saying he's a good guy.
NlCK: You're out of your mind.
- Yeah, get into it.
- I am so into this.
I can't wait until we're all "ménage-ing".
- Are you into this, Jess?
-  Yeah.
- Say you're wrong.
- No.
It's great.
- Say it's over and it's over.
- Okay.
Don't get nervous, Nick.
This is just a regular conversation we're having.
NlCK: Yeah.
- Except I'm rubbing.
NlCK: That's right.
- And I'm going to start unbuttoning your pants and then I'm gonna unbutton my shirt.
I'm not gonna take my underpants off.
Not right away.
I'm gonna keep my underpants on until I let you take my underpants off me.
Okay?
Because you are gonna be the underpants captain tonight.
- Makes sense.
- Great choice, Remy.
Nick will make a fantastic underpants captain.
Let's bring it in.
Okay.
You two get us started.
- Get it started?
- Yeah.
- All right?
- Us two?
Go ahead.
- Started.
You know what to do.
Breathe into each other.
- Oh, yeah, Jess.
I'm not here.
Relax into the ménage.
Let's get this started.
- You doing this?
Yes.
- Are you?
- Yes.
I will do it.
- Okay.
We're gonna.
- Let's do this.
- I will.
- Say you're wrong, and it's over.
- I'm not.
- You can't do this, but I can.
Okay.
Let's do this, Nick.
- Let's do it, Jess.
- I can do it.
No.
Okay, fine.
I admit it.
I'm wrong.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Remy.
What, we're not doing this?
NlCK: Not doing it.
No.
I get it, cold feet is just, it's part of the journey, so Whoa.
What is going on in here?
All right, I am not ready for a four-way.
That's I'm I'm I'm out of this.
To be honest, I'm kind of riding a weird ego high.
Why didn't you tell me four people couldn't live in this apartment?
If we're gonna do a shenanigan, I'm fine with doing shenanigans.
I love shenanigans, as long as no one gets hurt.
- Ow!
- Oh.
Okay, just so we're clear, we're gonna have to live with this, right?
- Yep.
- Absolutely.
SCHMlDT: Hey, Kim?
I just wanted to apologize for yesterday.
I hope you didn't get into trouble.
I really don't want to lose my job, okay?
I've worked at Associated Strategies for six years.
Nothing means more to me than Ass Strat.
Your lip is bleeding.
It opens back up when I talk.
Look Kim, this wasn't your standard 2 a. m. mistaken assault in the parking garage.
I've had a thing for you ever since I was the husky kid in the mailroom.
And if If you don't believe me there you go.
Straight from '07.
Read resolution number four.
It's about you.
"Only think about hot new CFO every other time I masturbate".
I did not live up to the challenge.
Number seven: "Start floating idea that people call me Mr. Finish slash Game-Time Jones, slash The Hook-up-erator".
- Can l?
- Number nine: "Pick a color of Crocs and buy them already".
Okay, thank you.
Hey.
Go into the conference room and dial me into the Tokyo call.
Now.
Yeah.
Pants.
Pants.
Five, six.
I dialed you into the Tokyo conference call.
Yo you look awesome.
My door is always open.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
NlCK: Oh, it's classic Nick Miller.
Look, I'm holding your hand.
WlNSTON: Ha, ha.
Yeah, I wanna go out tonight.
Ugh, couples.
Ew.
Hiss.
Every time you have sex with the same person you die just a little bit.
It's like a copy of a copy.
Lucky us, we get to go out looking for some strange.
Happy V-Day, player.
Holla.
Truth is I don't go out on Valentine's Day.
- What?
- There's no thrill.
All these bars filled with emotionally vulnerable women.
Like a Dominican teenager playing Little League.
It's not fair for everybody else.
It's my first single Valentine's Day in six years and I need to go out, okay?
We need to go out.
Because I'm feeling pretty twirly.
- Twirly?
- Twirly.
- ls that like horny?
- I got the dirty twirls, Schmidty.
Watch out because you're about to get laid, world.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess So we're doing this, full-on Valentine's.
- What'd you do last year?
- Uh, I was fighting with Caroline.
- What about?
- You know, the usual.
About how I make too much money, I dress too fancy I'm too good at communicating my feelings.
- Right.
- This year we're gonna make up for it.
You and me are gonna do a real Valentine's Day date.
I know.
God, what's the plan?
- You're gonna need a map of Arizona.
- I can get that.
A container you're comfortable getting urine in.
- Oh, I have one in my purse.
- You do?
No.
Bad idea.
You can't go on a first date on Valentine's Day.
I'm telling you, it's not a first date.
We used to hook up all the time.
For two years, I had her number in my phone as "Shretty".
I was too drunk to type "Shelby".
She just wants a relaxed night in.
It actually sounds kind of sexy.
- We're trying to figure each other out.
- Know where that puts you in six months?
Watching It's Complicated on DVD while you cradle your newborn baby.
And guess what.
It's not complicated.
It's about rich white people remodeling their kitchen.
- You sure you're really ready for that?
- It's gonna be great.
- What are you doing?
- Packing an overnight bag in case I have one-night sex.
- I've got T-shirt, socks-- - ls this a sewing kit?
Yeah, it's a sewing kit.
Stain remover.
Hello?
You don't have one-night stands.
You get way too attached.
You could have a connection with a shoe on the side of the road.
Oh, one shoe?
I hate that.
- ls this Schmidt's idea?
- It's my idea.
I wanna try a one-night stand.
Tonight is all about what Little Jess wants.
Little Jess.
All right.
I am gonna text Kyle and tell him to meet us at the bar because I'm not leaving you alone like this with all of that.
I'm sorry, I don't know who's smelling what tonight.
Excuse me, know where Julia Cleary's office is?
Uh, she need to sign for something?
Little late for a package.
Let me guess, your bike broke down.
Fixed-gear, single-speed.
- Been rocking a three-speed.
- I'm not a messenger.
CLlFF: Follow me.
- Okay.
CLlFF: She can get pretty cranky when she gets interrupted.
But I'll tell you what, I would still hit that.
I mean, despite the age difference, I would just take that to Pound Town.
You know what I mean?
Just take her on a visit to the boneyard.
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, Nick.
That's my boyfriend, Nick.
Hi.
That's my little intern, Cliff.
- Excuse me.
- What?
Could you get him a water?
Thank you.
Hey, Cliff.
Thanks, Cliff.
Sorry it's such a mess in here.
But I went full out with the cheesy Valentine's Day stuff.
Are you ready for it?
- What did you do?
- Ha, ha!
- Heart boxers.
The best.
- Right?
Putting them on right now.
You can't stop me.
I don't wanna stop you because I am gonna be rocking this action.
You were born to wear that thing.
- Never talk about any of this to anybody.
- Can we go?
I have a little bit more work to do.
Just like an hour.
WlNSTON: Hey, babe.
- Ooh, you brought wine.
- Yeah.
- We're almost out.
It's not the food.
Come on in.
Pick out a polish.
He looks like a player.
Ah, never mind.
I thought we said no guys.
WlNSTON: Ugh.
TlA: I am not touching his feet.
- I'm not kidding you.
- Amazing.
SCHMlDT: Where's what's-his-name?
We are actually gonna meet up later because he's got a little surprise for me.
- Spoiler.
It's his penis.
- Okay, stop.
Enough.
Pay attention.
- You're from Oregon?
- Yeah.
I'm from Oregon.
- Oh, no.
What?
- How often do you meet Oregonians?
I don't know.
- Oh, could you hold on one second?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, my God, he's from Oregon.
I'm from Oregon.
- Bad idea.
- Can't do this.
- Horrible.
You bonded emotionally.
Sorry.
Having sex with him, it's gonna be missionary with a lot of eye contact.
- That is not one-night-stand material.
Listen to him.
He's right on this one.
Sorry.
I know what I'm talking about.
I have my 10,000 hours.
Hmm?
Outliers.
You should read it.
Malcolm Gladwell.
It's one of my desert island books.
Along with Machiavelli's The Prince Freak by John Leguizamo, any scripts from the first season of Vampire Diaries.

SCHMlDT: Mm-hm.
- Uh, also, we both love lunch.
- Lunch.
Love lunch.
- You're kidding.
- Wow.
What a coincidence.
When people talk about breakfast being the most important meal - I'm like, "What"?
- What is that?
What about lunch, man?
You want another drink?
If I didn't know better, I'd think you're trying to liquor me up.
Why are you talking like that?
Oh, Oliver, we have nothing in common.
Yes.
I have no emotional connection to him at all.
But I'm just gonna eat lunch off that butt.
So, what about you?
That redhead?
I thought you totally had that.
SCHMlDT: Oh, that's in process.
This is where I do this look thing where my confusion makes her confused and also kind of hot.
Let me help you.
I'm gonna make her jealous.
All right, can you stop?
Cece, you are way too beautiful.
She'll think she doesn't have a shot with me.
- Stop looking at me like that.

I'm not even looking at you.
The pouty one, the naughty baby lndian.
"l ate something spicy.
Now my lip is swollen".

I'm gonna get up in it.
That's the biggest box of condoms I've ever seen.
Does it have a roller?
Like, you go through the airport with it?
- I'm gonna rip him a new one.
- Very intimidating.
A normal man can go maybe three times in a night depending on how much salmon he's had.
He's literally the most boring person I've ever met.
Described every lunch he's had this week and three of them were tacos.
- My work here is done.
- Not really.
Little favor.
He doesn't have a car, I don't have a car - because I came with you, so l-- - Oh.
No, no.
No.
No.
One of the tacos had extra cheese, and the other one had avocados.
And cheese.
And cheese, actually.
Well, I guess it's time to take that Chinese head out of that Chinese ass, Ming.
That's so sweet.
I love that.
Thank you.
- Pushed the reservation to 8:30.

JULlA : Hey, Confucius say, "You work for me".

Sorry to call you.
I know you're at dinner.
No, I'm not.
I'm hanging out with a guy named Cliff.
Are we hanging out?
That's awesome.
I'm at Shelby's, and there's two other girls here.
They're drinking juice, talking about Michelle Obama's workout.

- Leave.
It's just that I really enjoy being around this girl.
- All right, so stay.
- You know what?
I'm gonna stay.
Can I ask you something?
With her, the-- Is it gentle or is it not so gentle?
You know what I mean?
I'm gonna act like you didn't just say that, Cliff.
Fair enough.
JULlA: Yeah, Ming, I got your text.
What part of that did you not understand?
You want some champagne, Cliff?
OLlVER: Oh.
MAN 1: What?
Is he injured?
MAN 2: No, I think that's, uh-- - Pause.
Pause.
- Why are you pausing now?
Bathroom break.
In the middle of the movie.
What's wrong with him?
- Why are you here?
- You don't have a car, he doesn't.
- How you gonna get home?
- I'm gonna take a cab, Schmidt.
It's a horrible neighborhood, okay?
- There are youths everywhere.
- Youths?
Are you Officer Krupke?
Would you st-- ?
Damn it.
It's Cece.
Hello?
Why are you crashing Jess' one-night stand?
He wanted to watch Planet of the Apes.
I didn't know he meant now.
- Ugh.
- What's wrong?
- Tell him to leave.
- Get out of there, Schmidt.
Leave your car there and I'll come get you, okay?
What is going on?
Where are you?
Where's Kyle?
I'm at a playground.
Kyle's 'shrooming.
- Whoo, whoo.
- I'll see you guys later.
- I love brown people!
That's racist, Kyle.
OLlVER: Excuse me.
Back to the movie.
Ready?
SCHMlDT &  Yeah.
These monkeys look so real.
Apes.
They're apes.
Oh, you're one of those?
- Get out.
- Like there's a real difference?
Now.
- All right.
Youths.
You know what, Cliff?
I'm sorry, I'm just feeling very romantic and I have nowhere else to put it, so happy Valentine's Day, good-looking.
- You know what?
NlCK: What?
Put it right here.
Because I like it.
So how did you get that far into law school and then drop out?
Well, I got my heart broken.
- Yeah.
NlCK: Then everything got weird.
I started playing guitar - in an alt-country-ska band.
- Sure.
- Gambling a lot.
CLlFF: Yeah.
There was a weird week where I wore a long blond wig.
I made everybody call me Sandy Ferguson.
I have never loved anyone that much.
I drove to Mexico and I tried to enter a cockfight.
- As a person?
- Yes, Cliff, as a person.
Come on.
Get me out of here.
Help.
Help.
I've had a tough couple of days, Freddie.
Point is, I looked around at my life and I realized that I didn't wanna work for somebody else my whole life.
That is exactly how I feel, man.
Yeah, but the second half of that story is how I went broke and started working for somebody else my whole life.
- Okay.
What was that?
- I don't wanna be a lawyer.
- I don't wanna do this.
- Don't.
Not tonight.
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Oh, Cliff.
Look what I found under a pile of depositions.
- I'm quitting.
-  What?
- Nick convinced me I can't waste life stapling.
- I never said anything like that, Julia.
JULlA: Don't-- CLlFF: Not anymore.
Not working all night on Valentine's Day.
I'm just gonna get in my car, and I'm just gonna drive until I see the sun.
Because it's gotta be shining somewhere.
And for once in my life, I'm gonna spend some time with my birds.
- With your birds?
- Whoo!
No, Cliff.
We're gonna start paying you so soon.
Julia, I am so sorry.
I just told him a story about when I got arrested in Mexico.
- Arrested in Mexico?
- I wasn't gonna tell you until after you got knocked up and were stuck with me.
- Now I gotta do all this stuff.
- I know.
I'm sorry.
Just go home, Nick.
- Sorry.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
MAN : No!
What?
Are you kidding me?
Hey, Amy.
Uh, this is my ex, Amy.
We broke up last week.
She can't afford to move out.
She doesn't work.
What?
Hey, so how was your night?
Are you serious right now, Oliver?
- Yeah.
- Um, hey.
I'm Jess.
Uh Hey.
Who is she?
- What are you doing here, Cece?
- Sorry, I just came to get Schmidt.
Schmidt left like an hour ago.
- No, no, I didn't.
- Are you kidding me?
- My tires were stolen by street youths.
- Ugh!
Did I pee my pants?
Friends, did I pee in my pants?
- No, Kyle, you're just on drugs.
Guys?
- He definitely peed, I can see.
- See?
See?
Who's the idiot now?
Okay, all of you, get out of here.
- I peed my pants.
- We got to get out of-- Oh.
- This guy is like a magician.
- How does it feel, Oliver?
Okay.
Uh, Kyle, I'm the one you're gonna sleep with tonight, so we gotta--   What are you gonna do now?
- Ha, ha.
You're cute.
Here, I got you.
SCHMlDT: Okay.
- My man!
Get out of my house.
Yeah, we're going.
- I will murder you!
- Bye.
Yes.
Heck, yeah!
I'll get you!
What?
Hey, Kyle.
Hey.
It's a stick.
Go get it.
Oh, shiny.
Whew.
What does a girl gotta do to get a one-night stand around here?
Sorry.
This sangria is amazing, Winston.
My grandmother's recipe, so I can't take credit for that.
But seriously, Tia, you don't want a man who has fancier underpants than you.
- I keep trying to tell her.
- True.
You wanna have the fanciest drawers in the relationship.
Boom.
TlA: Wow.
OLlVER: Huh?
Hey, are you gonna be done soon?
Maybe.
She can't keep eating tacos all night.
- Yeah.
- I ate most of the tacos.
You know what?
I can't do this.
You're a really great guy and, um, l-- I mean, I don't know that, um but honestly, I was just gonna use you as a giant meat puppet.
I'm looking pretty good right now.
- It's just so hard, you know?
I feel so alone sometimes.
And I lied to you.
I'm not a web creator.
I'm not a player.
- I miss her so much.
- Oh.
She's in-- She's just in the kitchen.
Baby, can you make me a smoothie?
NlCK: Just making copies.
- Did you do all of this?
- I did.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Really?
I just want you to know that there's a photocopy of my butt - somewhere in your recycling bin.
- Okay.
I had a weird moment, Julia, and I went for it, okay?
And if anyone finds it I want them to know I moved during the copy - and I don't actually have two butt cracks.
- I know.
What?
I've never ever cared about Valentine's Day before.
Neither have l. But it's nice.
- Yeah.
- Right?
You did all the work wrong, though.
- Yeah, I know I did.
- That's okay.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
Do what you gotta do.
Hi, Ming.
Yeah, I got your text.
And yeah, it was wrong just like every single other text you've sent me tonight.
-  Can I call you tomorrow?
- Yeah, it's fine, go.
I'm sorry.
Are you really-- ?
Are you arguing with me about that?
Are you actually arguing with me about that?
Bye.
- Aw.
Bye, girl, thank you.
- Bye.
TlA: Ha, ha.
Bye, Shel.
That was fun.
- Anytime.
So you weren't expecting a girls' night, were you?
Ha, ha.
Not really.
You know, Tia needed some tough love.
You keep doing it.
What?
Making up for how you used to be.
You don't remember?
Valentine's Day 2008?
You said you'd call.
You didn't.
Um I waited all night.
Okay, I don't deserve a second chance with you, do l?
But here you are, getting one.
- Hey.
- Oh.
Hey.
What are you doing home so soon?
I helped him get back together with his ex.
He made me video-chat with his mom in Hawaii for a couple minutes and then I came home, so You don't want your first one-night stand to be with some stranger.
You gotta pick someone who's not gonna make a big deal out of the thing.
You have an urge, you act on it.
And, whatever you do, leave immediately afterwards.
God help you if you get sucked into a brunch.
- Thanks, Schmidt.
- Come here.
You smell good.
It's probably the oil of the ylang-ylang tree.
- Don't over-think it.
- Okay.
Don't over-think it.
Don't over-think it.
Don't over-think it.
- Schmidt?
NlCK: Hey, Jess, what are you doing?
- I was asking Schmidt a question.
- Whoa, whoa.
What?
- Were you-- ?
- What?
No.
- With Schmidt?
- No.
No.
I was holding those, but l-- Oh, my God.
- What has gotten into you?
- No.
- And why do you have so many condoms?
- Shh.
Don't ever speak of this again.
You need one.
Tops, two.
Let's go.
- We'll get these later.
- I was twirly.
- Nick, Nick.
NlCK: No.
You're not having sex with Schmidt.
This is a danger zone for you.
- What is happening out there?
-  Stop, do not move, okay?
If somebody catches us, I'm gonna say you drugged me - and it's my word against yours, okay?
- Okay, yeah.
That's fine, that makes sense.
You smell so good right now.
You are not gonna believe the stupid thing I almost did last night.
CECE : Tell me.
Okay, but you have to promise never to tell anyone, ever.
Of course.
Out with it.
Tell me.
Okay, I almost tried to hook up with Schmidt last night.
That would have been crazy.
I know.
Can you imagine?
Ugh.
I cannot.
I gotta go, okay?
Bye.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
SCHMlDT: Whoo.
To humping.
I was like a river.
Did you feel that?
Did you feel me sweeping you along with the current of my body?
You were like a canoe on my body river.
Like you'd ever be seaworthy with those breasts.
Boobies.
I wish there was a word that meant "complete satisfaction and complete self-loathing".
I've never seen a woman bite her own shoulder before.
- That was the last time.
- You said that twice last night.
You'll be back.
I'm like your black-tar heroin.
You just need that sweet taste in your veins.
Schmiddle and the damage done.
Neil Young, yo.
Just get me out of here without someone seeing.
Schmidt?
Oh.
- Did you have a sexual guest?
- What?
- The same girl from the other night?
- I don't know what you're talking about.
It is.
You slept with the same girl twice in a row?
Was it a mistake?
Was she wearing some disguise?
Hey, Nick, Schmidt slept with the same girl twice in a row.
I owe you $5.
I thought I heard the door open at 3 a. m. Those are sounds of true love.
Bet she had the time of her life.
- What happened?
Did I miss her?
- You did.
WlNSTON: I love meeting girls you bring home.
I like to pretend like I'm your lover on the down low, Theodore K. Mullins.
Damn, Schmidt, in our bed?
Where we shave each other?
I've always loved you.
You're my boo.
Theodore K. Mullins is not my type.
You gonna three-peat this ho?
Who is this bitch?
We wanna meet her.
I'm not gonna parade her around like some trophy.
You know me, I'm not that kind of guy.
Oh.
Schmidt told me this was the front door?
What's wrong?
She have a hunchback?
- Dwarf parts?
- Lovitz body?
She happens to be an incredibly beautiful woman.
She one of your heavy gingers?
- How big are her knuckles?
NlCK: Butter body?
Maybe it's a Hitler moustache.
I'm sorry, I just I wanna banter with you guys.
I just, like, panicked and I made a Hitler joke.
I'm sorry.
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess   Your science projects are looking great, you guys.
Love the potato battery, Harper.
Good job.
Thanks.
- Luke, I like your tree exhibit.
Think about changing the name.
Fine.
Whoa.
- You built a robotic arm.
- I think we know who's gonna win.
- Anyone can still win, Brianna.
- Even me, Miss Day?
Yes.
Okay, lunchtime.
Can I have lunch in here?
Oh, no, Nathaniel, what's wrong?
In the cafeteria, kids have started playing this game, coin slot.
They put pennies in my butt crack.
- I made 46 cents.
- No, no, you earned that.
Um Nathaniel, I'm gonna help you out.
Julia sent me a cactus.
She's on a business trip to China and she sent it to me out of the blue.
I'm not an idiot.
She's gonna break up with me.
Who told you that?
Did the cactus tell you that?
Is this one of those fortune-telling cactuses-- ?
Winston, think.
She's gonna break up with me.
She doesn't think I can take care of a regular plant.
Well, you can't.
Any idiot can take care of a cactus, Winston.
- She thinks I'm idiot.
- Why are you watering a cactus?
- Because I'm idiot.
- Julia sent him cactus which means she's gonna break up with him.
I thought that was a joke because otherwise that would be stupid and insane.
- Snap out of it, son.
- Jess, you don't get it.
This cactus is like a symbol of my relationship with her.
- Oh.
Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna quit on this.
I'm gonna get her back.
There it is.
Look at that.
Not bad.
Just fix red eye, red eye, red eye.
Send.
- Hello?
CECE : Where are you?
Oh, hey, Cecilia.
Did you get my junk mail?
I'm in front of your loft.
I know I said that last time was the last time, but - You wanna come down?
- Yeah, I wanna come  Yeah, I'll come down.
That sounds good.
All right.
I think I changed a life today, you guys.
I pulled a Gandhi, a real Gandhi.
There's a student of mine, he's been bullied for the past few months so after warning the kids that there would be serious repercussions if this continued, I delivered a lesson in the key of learning.
Learning minor.
He's a plump bird Who prefers the shelter of a hole He has a stubby beak And a nervous soul Because being chased by predators Takes its toll Let the sad sparrow fly on You think singing a song about a kid is gonna stop him from getting his ass kicked?
I know 12-year-olds are vicious, vengeful creatures.
Middle-school girls literally scalp each other.
I spent most of sixth grade with a bald spot on my head.
- What?
But don't tell me music can't make a difference because it can.
Those kids were videotaping me on their cell phones.
I think kids are gonna really remember that.
- You know, this day.
- What's the song called?
Um, "Sad Sparrow," parentheses, "lmagine a World Without Bullies".
- Why?
WlNSTON: This is why.
He's not the smartest bird Or the most pretty  He spreads disease Throughout the city At least the bully is not making fun of that kid.
They're making fun of me.
Sad sparrow fly on The hawk took a poop on you.
I'm not proud of myself for saying this, but it's a funny video.
Sad sparrow fly on Look at that, man.
Why can't we go upstairs for a little Schmidt and spin?
You said everybody's in the living room.
- What about your place?
- My place is not an option.
All the models are there.
It's 12 models in two rooms.
- It's like a room full of hungry Russians.
- Uh, yes, please, let's go there.
What about a little good, old-fashioned car sex?
I can't do my moves in there.
I like to improvise with my body.
I'm like a sexual snowflake.
Each night with me is a unique experience-- Okay, are we gonna do this or not?
I kind of need this to happen right now, okay?
Isn't there a Starbuck's bathroom around here we could use?
What do I look like, a Gypsy courtesan?
How hard are you gonna drop the hammer on the kid who did this?
I'm gonna find this kid, and I'm just gonna open up a dialogue.
Not gonna work.
Take it from me, I used to be a bully.
Ow.
- Brown Lightning.
- Wow, you had a catchphrase?
- Yeah.
You gotta hit them where it hurts.
Thank you, but I have a different approach.
Jerk-sica?
My last name rhymes with "gay" and the best thing you can think of is Jerk-sica?
Reason.
Hey, Schmidt.
Oh, there is?
Thank you.
He says look out the window.
There's a crescent moon out.
Oh, dip, seriously?
Why do we care about a crescent moon?
I don't know.
I'm gonna live up there someday.
Hey, Julia, what's up, girl?
Hope you're having a great time in Beijing.
I miss you.
I can't wait to see you.
I got the cactus.
Thank you so much.
I'm taking great care of it.
Yeah, things are doing good here.
Everything's really cool, just Taking names, kicking butt, you know, all that.
So great, I'll see you Wednesday.
You're the best around.
Nope, that's not gonna be the one.
Hey, Julia, just calling back to say that I get it.
Message received.
I'm the cactus.
If you put me in the desert, I'll grow some needles too.
You bet I would.
You bet I would.
FYl, I'm not high right now.
Julia.
Julia.
Call me back.
Call me back, Julia.
Julia, it's Nick.
I'm sorry, I just realized about the time difference.
So if you get this one first could you please just delete the other ones?
I love you.
What did I just?
I don't hear anyone out there.
I think I'm safe.
And I want you to know, that was the last time, okay?
This is over.
But we haven't even gotten to the cheese course.
A little sharp, aged cheddar?
Mm-hm.
Manchego?
Maybe some buttery Gruyère?
You sure you wanna miss out?
I just wanna slowly peel the wax off your Babybels.
What are you even saying?
- How about a little stinky taleggio?
- Why is this working?
- I am so turned on right now.
- Or maybe some cream cheese?
Want some schmear, Cece?
You know, what?
Cece, you should go.
Because if you have the strength to turn all this down do it.
Yeah, I'm good.
Hi.
Who do I speak to, re, getting something removed from the lnternet?
Yeah, I can hold.
- Wanna party with Havarti?
- Fine.
Give me the damn cheese.
So, Brianna, I saw the robot arm in the user profile so I know you made that video.
So I thought we could sit and talk for a minute.
Look, Brianna, I know you're better than this.
Can we talk about you for a few minutes?
Okay.
Can we talk about you instead?
I'm an open book.
Ask me anything.
How come you don't have a boyfriend?
And why did Mr. Genzlinger dump you?
And is it true that your boyfriend before that cheated on you?
Are you barren, Miss Day?
And why is your voice so deep like a man's?
- It's not.
It's not.
- Your happiness seems like a mask.
Well, I better go.
What have I done?
NlCK: Julia.
So glad you're home.
Hey.
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.
Welcome back.
- Are you sure?
- You listen to the messages?
- I did.
- You did?
That sucks.
- I really didn't mean anything.
- I know.
Look, I got in my head, Julia, I thought you sent me this cactus because you were trying to tell me that I can't take care of a normal plant.
Which, when I think about it, I probably can't.
Plants freak me out.
I'm way better with babies, actually.
Not that I want to have a baby with you right now.
- I can see us having babies.
- Can we not-- ?
That's not what I mean.
I'm getting weird again.
What I mean to say-- Julia, please, I overreacted.
I think we should break up.
I do.
I mean, I didn't realize it when I sent it.
But then after listening to the seven - Yeah, I know.
- seven, Nick, separate voice mails about the meaning behind the cactus I don't know, it really just clicked in for me and I don't think that we should do this anymore.
I'm really sorry.
So I was right about the cactus.
What kind of crazy person destroys a child's robot?
Can you bring me a bunch of Phillips-head screwdrivers and, like, a crescent wrench and, like, other tool things?
What if I'm busy?
Thank you, Winston.
I really needed that.
It's been a really hard week.
Hey, man, I'm going to the beach to watch the sun go down because I love sunsets.
Did you know that about me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Oh, Julia dumped me, so, sad face.
Wanna come to the beach?
I feel great, I'm ready to rock but I really don't wanna be alone.
Scissors?
How am I supposed to fix a robot arm with scissors?
- Those are my good scissors.
- Why do you have good scissors?
You know, the news only focuses on what goes wrong.
Never talks about what goes right.
- Evolution.
You know?
- That's it.
Come here.
NlCK: Yeah, exactly.
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Get him out of here.
NlCK: Hey, guys.
- What?
- You guys wanna watch The Piano later?
SCHMlDDT: Here?
You wanna do it here?
Okay, all right.
What's the scenario?
We enter separately pretending to be strangers meeting in the bathroom.
You want me on the can, off the can?
No, I just need to pop in this party for like 20 minutes.
- When I come back, we'll have sex.
- Okay, let's do it.
Oh, no.
Um, I'm going in there alone.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?
- I'll crack a window for you.
Crack a window for me?
What am l, your sex dog?
What-- ?
What if I have to go to the bathroom?
Just give me a chew toy.
Come on, Schmidt, stop being such a big baby.
Oh, my-- Are you ashamed of me?
Yes.
Absolutely, 100 percent.
I'm 100 percent ashamed of you.
Oh, what a revelation.
Come on, Schmidt, I can't be the first woman who's ashamed to be with you.
Okay, look, I won't go into your party, if If you go to breakfast with me tomorrow.
In public.
Yeah, okay.
- Oh, really?
- Really.
I mean, I can survive breakfast.
I'll be back soon.
Hey, Wendy.
How's it going?
I hope it works.
I didn't get a chance to test it.
Ha-ha-ha.
Even broken, it's got a shot at top prize.
Have you seen this crap?
"What can old people do"?
"Does it taste better with hot sauce"?
My friends.
Guess what I just learned?
What's inside of a pumpkin.
Apparently, a lot.
I didn't know.
Whoa.
You have to get him out of here.
You see him.
He's about to blow.
I'm not having him by himself.
There's Brianna.
Hi, Brianna.
You must be Brianna's moms.
I'm Miss Day.
- Right.
The singer.
- You're the one who sings.
This is Brianna's project, a robotic arm.
Start it up, Brianna.
Oh!
And a project bursts into flames.
Brianna, what happened?
Someone must have sabotaged it.
Bet it was Nathaniel.
Hey!
Get my scissors out of your mouth.
What is wrong with you?
He's been creating problems.
What are you gonna do?
Nathaniel, come over here.
Um Actually, uh, this is my fault.
I sabotaged the science project.
- You did what?
- What?
And it was totally unprofessional.
And I'm sorry, but your daughter is How do I put this?
- Brianna is difficult.
- Difficult?
- You sabotaged her project.
- Your daughter sucks.
Okay, she is a demon seed.
She is the spawn of Satan.
And I do believe I speak for the entire human race when I say that people like her should not be building robots.
- Who are you?
- Brown Lightning.
- I want her disciplined.
NlCK: No.
- No.
Wonderful.
Hey, no, no.
Why can't we all just love each other, right?
What are you doing?
Want a science project?
How about this as a science project?
Love is a myth.
Why is this Earth so big and I am so small?
So, yay, Earth.
Be optimistic?
Learn.
We're all gonna die alone, so   My office, 9 a. m. NlCK: I was right about the cactus.
I assure you I'll be watching Miss Day very closely.
Hi.
I am so sorry, Tanya.
Don't be.
I love it.
Jess, you're a real teacher now.
- What?
- You're a kid hater.
You're one of us.
Come here.
Welcome.
I'm not a kid hater.
That's right.
None of us are.
Hey, Brianna.
Can I speak to you?
Look, I know I'm not your favorite teacher.
You don't like my style.
That's fine.
I'm not gonna change who I am so you're just gonna have to deal with it and respect it.
Also, you're gonna take this paper, and you're gonna sing a duet with me.
- What?
- Oh, yeah.
Everybody, settle down.
- Camera phones are encouraged.
- No.
One, two, three, four.
You really don't wanna be seen having breakfast with me, do you?
- Are we even still in L.A.?
- Schmidt, you and I are not together.
We're not in a relationship.
- We're just having sex.
- And I love it.
And I'm not gonna be a prize that you get to show off.
Look, guys are always just showing me off, and I hate it.
Look, l I wanna tell people because I think that you are the dopest, flyest smartest, ballsiest, bitchiest, truly terrifying woman that I have sexually enjoyed in a really long time.
Do you wanna tell the waitress?
Uh, if I could have everyone's attention.
Real quick, if you could Hey, guys, call a timeout to whatever that thing is.
Okay, great.
I am having sex with this woman right here.
You wanna stand up?
- No.
SCHMlDT: Don't wanna do it?
All right, great.
I'm enjoying myself immensely.
It's a physical thing, but I am definitely for real having sex with this girl right here, to completion.
Parkour!
Hit it!
Down.
Hit it.
Down.
Hit it.
NlCK: Yeah.
Hey.
I got you a real plant.
NlCK: Yeah, I don't want it, Jess, I'll just kill it.
I know.
You're a plant killer.
And I write songs.
We're weirdos.
But that's who we are.
And that's fine.
And you have a giant cactus needle sticking out of your face.
What?
Where is it?
Can you get it out?
Get it out.
Ow.
So it's time we all make a change  Find somewhere else For our loose change The song is called, "Let Me Lift You Up With My Robot Arm"?
- Yeah.
- Catchy.
Title is flawed, no question.
But you are kicking ass with the comments.
Look at this.
- "This teacher is muy caliente.
" - Hot, hot, hot.
WlNSTON: "I'd like to grade her on a curve".
Yep.
"Finally, entertainment that doesn't resort to salty language".
Finally.
- These commenters are all you, aren't they?
- Yes.
Yes, they are.
JESS & BRlANNA : My robot arm
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Nick, go out 10 yards, cut left.
Winston, go long, post right.
Jess, go out towards the parking lot.
Get in the car.
We'll meet you at the loft.
Oh, very funny.
You're a comedian, Schmidt.
Hike!
Schmidt!
Come on!
Oh.
Did you see that?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.
Nick.
NlCK: Oh, my God!
Nick, I'm so sorry.
- This is real!
- Probably lateral sizer.
Shut up!
Okay, let's go.
- Rotator cuff?
Can l-- ?
- What do you need?
NlCK: Nothing.
Please go far from me right now.
I can taste my spine.
- Three or your four down there.
Vertebrae.
- Why is no one helping me?
Not you!
Not you!
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess  Are you sure you're okay?
You're walking like a Disney witch.
Let me drive to your doctor.
I don't have a doctor.
I don't have insurance.
Nick, you need to see a doctor, if only to make sure your junk is clean.
- Don't go to doctors.
I'll take you to Sadie.
- Just look at you.
She won't charge you.
- I don't go to doctors!
- Are you sure you're okay driving?
- I'm fine.
I've never been better.
I'm great.
Thank you.
Feeling better already.
See you guys back at the loft.
Oh, my God!
- Oh!
- What did you just-- ?
NlCK: I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
Don't worry.
WlNSTON: What did you do?
You hit my car!
NlCK: I'm okay.
WlNSTON: Oh.
Oh, Winston, relax.
Okay?
Relax.
That's all I did.
I did this.
The rest was already there.
Actually, I think I undid a dent there.
I'm taking you to see my friend.
- Jess, no.
- Now!
So she's fitting us in between patients.
Jess is Sadie a gynecologist?
- No, she's an OB/GYN.
- I'm gonna go.
- Different thing.
- I'm gonna get out of here.
- Yeah?
I don't think you are.
- Aah.
Nick, she's a wizard with a speculum.
- Nick.
- I don't have a vagina.
- You can take mine.
Ha-ha.
- I heard that, sister.
- True that.
NlCK: Oh!
- Ha, ha.
Okay, you know what, Nick?
I'm sorry that my only doctor friend is a gynecologist but you're broke, so you're gonna have to shut your mouth and you're gonna tag the things you want in this Lucky magazine.
We'll have to put this baby to bed.
No, Sherman, look, I don't think you understand, man.
This car has been with me through everything, so if you could just fix it.
- This is not officially a car anymore.
- You didn't even buy the thing.
Given to you as an illegal recruitment gift from a college you didn't even go to.
Things happened in this car.
- Desert Storm?
- Oh, things happened.
Is this your car?
- Yeah.
Cool.
Anytime.
- Time to buy a new car.
- You buy a new car.
I bought a new car.
It's what you borrow every morning when this one makes the weird sound.
- Not a good sound.
- The keys.
You shouldn't call them keys.
It's a paperclip that you start the car with.
SCHMlDT: See?
That was the noise I was telling you about.
WlNSTON: Shut up.
You don't have to sit like that.
It's the only way that it feels okay, Jess.
- Jess.
- Sadie.
- Hey.
- Hey.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
- Good to see you again, Nick.
- Hey.
SADlE: Hi.
- We were playing football, I tackled him.
- That's not exactly how I saw it.
I'm surprised you got hurt.
Such a big boy.
Jess tackled a girl I was dating once.
Oh, yeah.
She tried to steal my overalls.
- Okay, so does that hurt?
- Yeah, yeah.
Yes!
- All right.
Does that hurt?
- Aah, ha, ha.
Ow!
- All right.
He can flip over.
- Okay.
Okay.
So listen.
This is not an official examination.
I am not officially telling you you bruised your spine and I'm not officially giving you these pills to manage the pain.
Okay.
- So - Thank you.
- Don't take those pills.
- Take the pills.
SADlE: Don't take those.
Take the pills.
- Nobody prescribed them.
- Take them.
- No.
- That's a code.
Take them.
SADlE: That's bad.
Don't do that.
- That means do it.
SADlE: No.
Those are designed for severe menstrual cramps, so they should cure your baby backache.
Baby backache.
Wait.
Stop.
Hey, take another sip of water.
- Yeah.
What?
- What's wrong?
- Your thyroid.
I noticed something while swallowing.
Mind?
- I don't know what choice I have.
Do it.
Okay, Jess.
Stop.
Yeah, he has a growth.
- Oh, my God.
A growth.
- Oh, no.
Everything works.
Oh, my God.
- I know what you're talking about.
- You knew about this?
- Yes.
- So you've had it checked out?
- I don't have that stuff checked out.
I'm fine.
I can set up an ultrasound tomorrow morning.
Got a friend.
- I can't afford an ultrasound, but-- - You're gonna have to.
Yeah.
SADlE: All right.
- So I'll set that up?
- Absolutely.
SADlE: Make sure he goes, Jess.
- Don't look at me like that.
- It's probably nothing.
Yeah, it's nothing.
Oh, God.
Put the baby's head at the bottom.
I'm not gonna go tomorrow.
I'm really not, because I don't wanna get an ultrasound.
I don't have time.
I've got some writing I got to do.
The truth is with working out, I've got some people to see so I just can't make it.
I lost a stamp.
Sounds worse than it is.
It's a somewhat expensive stamp and I had planned on looking for it.
One of the reasons I moved to Los Angeles was to get closer to whales, record them.
I haven't got around to it.
Where we live is actually east.
It's way farther from the ocean than I expected.
I appreciate your concern.
It's nice.
But this machine is still kicking.
You're going.
And I know you're scared.
But you know what my mom used to do when I got scared?
A Daffy Duck impression.
- Don't do what you're about to do.
-  Nicholas.
I'm sorry you have a lump in your throat.
That's despicable!
Sorry.
Too much?
- Okay.
I gotta go to work.
- I'll come with you.
- Absolutely not.
- I'll sit by the bar.
No way.
One more time You told them, Jess?
Really, it's not a big deal.
- Don't tell them.
- We're just hanging out.
- With my best friend.
- Come on, Schmidt.
What are you do-- ?
Pfft!
You just Fredo-kiss me?
What's your problem?
Go sit down.
- You're gonna beat this.
- I don't have anything.
What is going on with you guys?
Thanks for telling them.
I take those too, when I got a heavy flow.
Good to know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I heard.
Of course you did.
Can I get a vodka soda?
Thank you.
You being normal-- - Vodka soda.
- Okay.
It's because he refuses to wear a Bluetooth.
I gave him one for his birthday too, but he just laughed in my face.
Gave it back to me for Hanukkah.
Well, according to this website, it could be a colloid nodule.
But that's most common in golden retrievers.
I thought my lifestyle choices would rub off on him.
Tried to set a good example.
Treat your body like a temple.
Treat your body like a temple.
But he treats his like a dump.
Like a dump.
Let me see this.
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey.
My friends.
Can I just say that these pills are amazing?
I feel, like, really warm in my uterus.
Oh.
I feel good.
Feel real good.
What's with the long faces?
- Schmidt?
- Just looking at you - and your beautiful soul.
- Big, strong Nick.
He's a champ.
I wish I could trade places with you, because I would do it in a second.
I'm also glad that I can't.
- Okay, what is going on with you three?
Oh, God.
- Jess?
Hey, are you okay?
- Oh, God.
- You're gonna freak him out.
- Why are you crying?
- Schmidt, are you crying?
- You're making me cry with your emotions.
Really, Winston?
You?
- Just that I love you so much.
- Stop it.
Enough.
Hey, I'm fine.
- Just stop it.
- How do you know you're fine, Nick?
Is that-- ?
Would that be where-- ?
In my neck?
Hm.
I'm not gonna lie.
I think the pills are on top of me a little bit.
I think you're right.
It's so sad.
It's sad your friend is getting an ultrasound tomorrow.
It's just so hard.
Are you using your best friend's medical crisis to feel my boobs with your face?
Why isn't the whole world making love all at the same time?
How many ears does Daniel Boone have?
He's got a right ear, a left ear and a front-ear.
"Frontier".
Get it?
You don't get to speak at my funeral.
- Heh.
What?
- For sure.
One hundred percent.
What?
Why?
- Because of that joke.
- Yeah, but-- Jess, you don't wanna talk at a funeral.
I've tried that once.
What kind of dummy fixes a washing machine using a knife?
This kind of dummy!
It did not go well.
I don't want you talking at my funeral!
- Okay.
- You can go to my funeral but you can't talk.
My funeral is my time to shine.
I want the girls to think: "l wish I brought Nick Miller to orgasm".
I want the guys to think: "l wish I bought him more stuff".
And I don't want Daffy Duck voices and feeling sticks.
You don't know how to be real.
I can't have you trying to cheer people up.
I know how to be real.
Question: Am I wearing a hat?
SCHMlDT: Nick Miller.
Almost a lawyer.
This is a sad song Oh.
This is the saddest song in the world Yes, it is.
WlNSTON: Mm.
This is the saddest-- - You just keep singing, man.
- Okay.
This is a sad song Hey, hey Mm-hm Saddest song in the world Got a nice voice, man.
It is so weird being sober right now.
Can I get some weird rapping?
Nick Miller, Nick Miller From the streets of Chicago 'Cause players play Like they do like they did WlNSTON: Mm-hm Sad song 'Cause the ballers ball and the-- In the 'hood 'cause he's Chi-Town hustle - In the world NlCK: That's sounds great.
SCHMlDT: People of Chicago represent him 'Cause the players don't play And the player's in the city Nick Miller, Nick Miller Is a stone-cold killer - Huh!
Sing it, you know.
You feel.
- Likes the taste of vanilla Nick Miller, Nick Miller He's the illest of the ill Cece's rapping!
He pours a hundred drinks And none have ever spilled Plus he's super high On a bunch of pain pills His favorite movie is The Big Chill He's got a hairy chest 'Cause he eats a balanced meal - Kicking mad flavor in his ear.
- Sad song  'Cause the ice in my glass Represents the tears from my eyes I love you, dawg This is a sad song Nick Miller, Nick Miller, yo Streets of Chicago Rough and tumble, one love You my heart Nick Miller, Nick Miller.
Never does anything.
What?
You want me to get real and stop being cutesy and whatever, fine.
Let's get real.
You don't do anything.
What did you wanna do?
Isn't there something you wanted to accomplish?
Hey, I've done things.
I wrote half a book about zombies.
Okay, just tell me.
If you could do anything what would you do?
You know, I'm the guy who-- I can't just jump into something if I don't know what's gonna happen.
I never have been that guy.
Like, I'm the guy that-- If I don't know what's gonna happen, I don't do something.
Ever.
I don't care how bad I wanna do it.
I don't do it.
Like, if everybody would go into the ocean and jumped in the water I'm the guy on the beach guarding the wallets.
All right.
- All right, Nick.
- All right.
- Get out there.
I'll hold your wallet.
- Don't have one.
Well, that's fine.
I've a sandwich bag with my license and money in it.
Okay, I'll hold your sandwich bag.
Get out there, go.
It's a little cold.
Heh, heh.
Just in terms of running into the water, it's a tad on the cold side.
Well, you know what?
Just It's just   We taking our shoes off?
What's going on?
I'm a little drunk, and I can't be too sure but I think you're finally about to see your best friend's penis.
Nick-- He's gonna-- He's gonna show his penis to the ocean and not me?
Nick, wait!
I'm alive!
I am alive!
I'm alive!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
This is stupid!
Aah!
It's cold!
My testicles are in my abdomen!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
That is so cold!
That is so cold!
- Words can't describe how cold that is.
- You okay?
No, I'm not okay, Jess!
I'm not okay!
I woke up today and I wanted to play a friendly game of touch football then I hurt my back, and I went to your gynecologist and now I might have cancer!
So, no, Jess!
I'm not okay!
I don't think this is the right time to bring this up, you guys but does anyone else think Nick could stand to lose 5 to 7 pounds?
You know what I'm thinking about, Cece?
What, Schmidt?
That when you stand up there's gonna be, like, a perfect imprint of your butt in the sand.
That is what you're thinking about now, with your best friend going through what he's going through?
- Then why would you say that?
- I don't know why.
Why would anyone say that?
I've never gone through anything like this.
Yeah, well, I have.
What happened?
My dad died when I was 12.
- That's, um-- - Only way to get through it is to get through it.
- I had a cat that died.
- Don't compare my dad to your cat.
It was a big cat.
I mean, human-size.
Hey.
Oh, hey.
- ls this seat taken?
- Oh, please.
Here, will you help me up?
I know that you're right.
You're right, I have to start doing things.
I can't just You know Jess.
I like you a lot.
I really do.
I'm glad you're around.
I'm not gonna remember any of this in the morning, am l?
Most certainly not.
Oh, no.
Yes.
Yeah.
- Yeah, we should go home.
- Yes.
Let's go home.
Hey.
We gotta wake up.
- It's morning.
- What?
Hey, Schmidty!
Wake up!
Everybody, up!
Everybody, up.
I got that ultrasound thing.
We're late.
What?
Oh.
Hey, Winston.
We're late, man.
SCHMlDT: Enough fresh air.
Back to the fume chamber.
NlCK: Couldn't even sell it for metal.
WlNSTON: Hope you didn't get sand in my car.
SCHMlDT: That's this car's problem, too much sand.
Oh, my God, there's soot coming in from the floor.
Hi.
My name is Nick Miller.
I have 9 a.m. today.
Fill these out.
I'm gonna need a copy of your health insurance.
I'm gonna be paying with cash, actually.
It's a mixture of paper money and change.
I do have a check that's postdated.
There's a 60-40 shot that's gonna clear.
I hope that's good.
Jess-- Oh, yeah.
Do I have to do this now?
How long does it take to tell if someone has cancer?
NlCK: Guys.
- Hey.
I'm okay.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
It's nothing.
Yeah.
- What did they say it was?
- I didn't hear anything after they said: "You don't have cancer".
I blanked out.
I think it's, like, a cyst or something.
Ugh.
Stop Fredo-kissing me, Schmidt.
All right, so what do I owe you?
Let's figure this out.
- I've got-- - It's already taken care of.
What do you mean it's already taken care of?
Oh, we split it.
All right, well, I'll pay you guys back.
I just - Can you please get a wallet?
- I do have a wallet.
A wallet.
I have tons of wallet chains that you can borrow.
Deep inside the ever-spinning - Hey, Jess?
- Hm?
- What happened last night?
- Nothing.
Come on, come on, come on.
SCHMlDT: Let it go.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Just gotta give it a second.
SCHMlDT: It's cruel at this point.
NlCK: That car's dead, bud.
'Till we're running from it I'd take care of you  If you ask me to In a year or two Oh, oh, oh WlNSTON: Don't walk so damn fast.
I'm coming.
Can't a man say goodbye to his car?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
SCHMlDT: Here?
You're dropping me off here?
Right in front of this obvious pickpocket?
Look at the size of that guy.
He's clearly new homeless.
We're a mile away from the loft, Cece.
- I'm not getting caught with you.
- I'm gonna have to run home.
And I have my slippiest loafers on.
Get walking right now.
You're never gonna get home before dawn.
Okay, look, I'm fine with you not telling anybody about us.
But you cannot just call me at any time and just summon me for intercourse.
I have no control here and I'm stressed out all day long.
It's like you're ripping the side block out of my mental Jenga.
I'm totally falling apart.
Okay, Schmidt, you-- You really need to learn to take a breath and calm down, all right?
We're just being a little spontaneous.
Words that have never been used to describe Schmidt: "Spontaneous, flexible, easy-going".
- I'm like a Marine.
- Nothing like a Marine.
I'm totally like a Marine.
All right, you know what?
Fine.
I'm out of here.
Take these, and take care of them.
I can get a tetanus shot but I can't cure damaged suede.
You believe I found this on the street?
- Who would want to throw this away?
- A blind man who recovered his sight?
Get rid of it, Jess.
Pine has no place in this loft.
- The wood of poor people and outhouses.
- I pay rent.
So I think that gives me the right to add a few things.
Jess, you are wrong.
Okay?
My answer is no.
Well, my answer is yes.
I'm keeping the hutch.
I had a bad night.
I'm just asking you, please don't push me.
I'll reinstate my ban on high-waisted shorts.
- You would not dare.
- Try me.
That was the worst four weeks of my life.
Hey, girl What you doing?
Hey, girl Where you going?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess Winston, why are you still drinking?
It is 10 in the morning.
Yeah.
I know what it'll feel like when I stop so I'm just gonna stay a little drunk forever.
Why is there no girl version of you, my man?
WlNSTON: Mm.
- Moving on.
- So last night's poker game.
Got pretty intense.
What are you talking about?
I was hammered last night.
I've never been more sober in my whole life.
I'll remember this as long as I'm all in.
Uno bitches.
Read them and weep.
- Straight flush.
- Aw.
- What I owe you, 20 bucks?
- Twenty bucks?
- Yeah.
- You owe me $487.
Come on, Winston.
Gosh!
Schmidt makes me so mad!
I want to put one thing, one thing in the living room, and he won't let me.
- I'm not putting up with it.
- Yes, you are.
We live in a fragile ecosystem.
- It's a delicate balance.
- It's a broken ecosystem.
- Dominated by an apex predator.
- Chill out.
We let him run the house.
No big deal.
The boy cooks and cleans.
And happily, I might add.
He probably couldn't sleep last night, he was so excited to clean up after us.
WlNSTON: I know he's been bad lately but Schmidt's an odd bird.
He can't handle it when things aren't clean and orderly.
It's been that way since the day he moved in.
Welcome to your new home, Schmidt.
Come on, play ball!
You see him rockin' that beat From across the street  Coming home!
Well, I'm fed up with it.
And he's gotta learn how to relax.
And, Nick, why do you have cannons drawn all over your back?
- Those aren't cannons, Jess.
- Mushrooms?
- Nope.
- Oh, so that's not a mossy cave?
- Mm-mm.
- Probably not.
What the?
What is happening?
I can't take this right now.
What, do we live in a pawn shop?
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey, Jess.
What-- ?
Where did all this come from?
I found the afghan underneath a dumpster outside an animal shelter.
And I found the lamp underneath the afghan.
I'm gonna assume that these are your spices jammed in here with my spices.
I'd appreciate it if your non-Tahitian vanilla was not touching my Tahitian vanilla.
Oh, Schmidt.
They're more than touching.
What's it like living in the most populous isle in French Polynesia?
I could tell you or I could show you.
-  Not in front of the cloves.
- Where's my burr coffee grinder?
Uh, I think it's in the hutch.
You put it in the hutch?
Uh-- This thing was on the street.
It's a coffee grinder, Schmidt.
I think it'll be okay.
A top-of-the-line, conical burr coffee grinder.
You know what that means?
It doesn't smash up the beans like a blade grinder.
It actually grinds them for a deeper, richer, more satisfying flavor profile.
Oh.
Well, I've used it repeatedly to make homemade crayons.
Does that show up in your flavor profile, Schmidt?
Yeah, that's fine.
If you're looking for your oven mitts they're in the top drawer of the hutch.
- Okay, fair enough.
Hutch is gone.
- No.
- No, no, no.
No hutch.
- No.
No, no.
Stop.
SCHMlDT: Bye, hutch.
This makes me nauseous.
- Don't move the hutch.
- This is my hutch, don't move it.
- You're right, you're right.
I'm so sorry.
You're right.
It's a beautiful piece.
It looks great there.
My apologies.
Thank you.
Shoot.
Schmidt, you have a real problem.
And you've gotta learn to calm down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I love the beach.
Now, isn't this better than arguing about a hutch?
Yeah, if you like hanging out on the rim of a giant fish toilet.
Jess, I can't believe you brought me down here.
This is a great place to talk about your problems.
- Jess, this sucks.
I just want to go home.
- Schmidt, come here.
Look.
We got the birds in the sky.
The sea and the sand.
The wind in our hair.
You lost your kite!
Have fun flying your string all day!
Sorry, I forgot my wallet.
Thank you for paying, it's delicious.
Which is weird.
I remember saying, "Hey, man, don't forget your wallet".
- I still forgot it.
You said that.
- You still forget it.
- We're getting older.
- Okay, this is a good segue.
Can I talk to you about something that's kind of tough?
Yeah, man.
Shoot.
"The subject of this talk is the debt of money between us.
- I feel that-- " - Oh.
Man!
I thought this was about something serious.
You set that up like it was different.
This is about the poker?
I'll pay you your money.
Relax.
"lf I am reading this section, I can only assume you have told me to relax".
- You wrote that.
- "Let me assure you I am relaxed, although, I have reason not to be - as you owe me a very large sum".
- I will pay you the money.
"l am aware that we're both broke.
One of us, embarrassingly so.
Points to Nick.
I have recently tumbled down the socioeconomic ladder, hit rock bottom where you, Nick Miller, have been waiting patiently for the past 15 years.
But I want that money.
Give me my money.
I really mean it.
It's my money.
You owe me that money, so give me my money, seriously".
- Finished?
- "Where's the money, dude"?
- You wrote "dude"?
- "But I am not without pity.
I am willing to just call it an even $200".
- Everything?
Like the-- With just $200?
- Right.
All right, I can do 200.
- Two hundred dollars?
Two hundo clean?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Yeah.
I did pay for gas here, though.
So that's, let's say, 10 bucks.
So we're at 190.
We'll say a clean 190.
I hate to be this guy.
But I got the fights on Friday, so that's 30.
So let's call it 160 and be done with it.
Twenty dollars for beer that night, so 160 takes us to 140.
Just to be fair.
I didn't write a stupid letter about it.
But let's say right now 140.
You ate a lot of the nachos!
Littering!
Fifteen dollars for littering!
What a way to live a life How fun is this?
It's not my cup of tea.
Don't you know that life don't wait for death?
No, no, no!
Jess, no!
I can't believe I never noticed this before, but Schmidt, you are legitimately crazy.
We're all a little bit crazy, don't you think?
No, you're like aging-ballerina child-chess-prodigy, professional-magician crazy.
It's my mom's fault.
I come from a Jewish family but she told me Santa didn't come to our house because my room was dirty.
The only thing I ever controlled was what I ate, so I got fat.
I got fat because I ate Concord grape jelly from the jar using a candy bar as a fork.
Because you didn't have any structure.
Know what I mean?
It's what happens when you don't have any rules.
None of these people have rules.
Especially that guy.
He's wearing ladies' bikini bottom.
Jess, I'm not like these people, okay?
I don't have dreadlocks, I don't own a snake.
And I don't understand how they think they're relaxed, they have nothing to do.
- It's not me.
It's not that easy for me.
- Sounds to me like a lot of excuses, Schmidt.
Just be spontaneous.
Hey, Nick.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you while you're clearly working hard, making money.
- All right.
- Kindly pause that for one second I have a few accounts that I'd like to settle.
Account number one: A $15 receipt for a Chinatown box turtle.
- Bam.
Here we go.
- We're doing this?
- Yeah, we are.
- Great.
Item number two: Cancelled $35 check for registration of a domain name: ltsNickMillerTime.com "Hey, guys, I've got a good idea.
I'm gonna be a blogger".
I have to go to work at a bar where you drink for free.
- Wow.
- How much does 400 - cognac and colas add up to?
- You wanna go there?
How about all the times I sat listening to you bitch about how - Caroline broke your little heart?
- Okay, in 8th grade, you "accidentally" saw my mom naked before she stopped exercising and let herself get chubby.
Okay?
So how much is that in terms of money?
I haven't gotten over that.
Now I'd say 4 to 5 thousand dollars.
SCHMlDT: Hey, guys.
- Winston saw my mother naked in 8th grade.
- ln terms of money-- - I went in the ocean without my aqua socks.
- He did it.
He let go.
- I did it.
He washed his hands in a public restroom.
And there was a man in there using the toilet full sit, no door, and I didn't break eye contact, not once.
That's not letting go, that's cruising.
Hey, Schmidt.
- There's a spill.
- I know.
Do your exercise.
You know.
Yeah, okay, the exercise, yeah.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
I feel great.
I'm gonna go take a shower with Nick's bar of soap like a common ranch-hand.
- No, no, no.
- What is going on?
- You messed with the ecosystem.
- And you guys said it couldn't be done.
- You have no idea what you're getting into.
- You're welcome.
NlCK: Schmidt, you're killing me with that drumming!
You're killing me!
Look at this mess.
How did this happen?
So this is your fault.
No.
No.
This is good for Schmidt.
You guys have been taking advantage of him for years.
- You make him cook, make him clean.
- Where is my money, dude?
Frankly, it's - sexist.
Oh, my God.
Ew.
- How is it sexist?
- Who's cleaning up?
- I cleaned this morning.
All right, fine.
I'll clean.
You go to the store.
- I'm not going with him.
- I'm not going.
Stop throwing things at each other.
- Where's my money?
Come on.
You're gonna get hurt.
- You're a child.
SCHMlDT: Silence, friends.
- I made you necklaces.
- Hey, do you wanna go to the store?
Please, God, yes.
A hundred dollars?
How does Schmidt buy groceries with 100 bucks?
- It's only $100?
- A hundred.
We have way too much stuff.
- Yeah, you like shrimp cocktail.
- We don't need a baked ham, Winston.
- Sorry about that.
WlNSTON: Really?
Really?
- Two cake mixes?
All these soups?
WlNSTON: Pizza?
Frozen pizza, you fat-ass?
What do you wanna do, die?
We have enough ketchup.
Next, please.
Hey, how are you doing, sir?
We only have $100, Gary.
So could you stop when we hit a hundred?
Yeah, you gotta include tax too, so like, 93, just-- Pfft.
Cool?
Okay, guys.
I'm gonna put my stuff at the front.
You don't know how to shop.
- Ketchup.
Are you kidding me?
- We have enough ketchup.
WlNSTON: Enjoy the ride.
- Epsom salt?
- You're too good for regular salt?
- I've gotta soak my trick foot.
Oh, Winnie, your little trick foot.
Yeah, my trick foot, and don't call me "Winnie".
Oh, Winnie.
Fine.
You don't owe me anything.
Slate is clean.
We're even.
- Good, that's how I feel too.
- ln my mind, your mom will be the winner of best boobs.
- Really?
Best boobs?
- Yeah.
Master's division.
You're gonna talk about my mom's boobs?
- You gonna go there?
- Don't push me in a supermarket.
You started this.
Did you just slap me?
No, I did not.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm not afraid of you, man.
Don't act so--  NlCK: Grow up, dude!
Hey, Schmidt.
Oh, hello, Jess.
- Hey.
- What are you doing out here?
Just checking up on you.
Oh, I see you're eating street meat wrapped in street meat.
This is my man, Gordon.
You've outdone yourself once again, Gordon.
Excellent.
- Did you go to work today?
- No.
No work.
- I haven't been there in a while.
- How long?
Three days.
Schmidt, I made a mistake in bringing you down here.
I shouldn't have done that.
Please come home.
Why?
So I can cook and clean?
So I can show you where the vacuum is?
All right.
Okay, fine, I don't know where the vacuum is.
That is one reason why I came here.
But I really wanted you to come home.
Everything's falling apart without you.
Nick and Winston are fighting all the time and all of us lost our keys to the mailbox.
Schmidt, just listen to me because you don't belong here, like, really.
You remember when you got yourself off to An Inconvenient Truth?
How about when you dressed up like Shia LeBeouf from Wall Street 2 for Halloween?
You remember when you said jazz music was America's greatest mistake?
Say it in drums, Jessica Day.
Mi hablo drums.
Hey, man, I got the last frozen thing.
I was gonna ice my wrist, but How about this?
Take half, pal.
So kind of you.
- That hurts, man.
- Ahh.
I am so hungry.
Remember those things Schmidt used to make us with the peanut butter and the raisins on the celery?
What were those called?
- Ants on a log.
- Ants on a log.
I just got why they're called ants on a log.
Looks like ants on a log.
I'm hungry, man.
Hey, Schmidt, is that you, buddy?
No, it's me.
- What happened to you?
- I went down to the beach.
And I tried to talk to Schmidt but he just ignored me and he went back to twirling his fire baton.
He's really bad.
He burned a lot of people.
They should let you twirl it around a few times before they actually light it on fire.
Well, look, Jess, being friends with Schmidt is really complicated.
Because you want to change him so badly, but you can't because he'll just get worse.
You guys were right.
I upset the ecosystem.
This is not what I wanted.
I just wanted to put my hutch here.
Make the place my own.
Be a part of the family.
- What family?
With these clowns?
- Yeah.
You clowns.
Well, look, you want in?
You're in.
Congratulations.
Welcome to the family, Jess.
Aw.
We don't "aw" in this family.
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Schmidt, um We need to talk.
Something not cool?
Schmidt, we miss you.
- You just want me to clean.
- No, that's not true.
It's a little bit true.
- Okay, look.
- I want you to clean.
We're so proud of you for letting go and relaxing but this isn't like you.
You can run away from your problems but you're just gonna find new ones that pop up, like hepatitis.
And Nick and Winston want to say to you that they really miss you.
You're freaking me out.
That crystal around your neck.
Nick, the crystal symbolizes energy.
All that crystal is is rock poo, Schmidt.
Look, I need you, Schmidt.
Okay?
I need you to tell me what pants not to wear.
And to exercise more.
I need you to make fun of me when I call a panini a hot sandwich.
How am I ever gonna learn?
I even miss your hair chutney.
Without you, man, we're just three idiots who live together.
You make us a family.
Well, I'm the cool rebel brother.
- You're the mom.
- The mother.
Look, Schmidt, if you come back to us I'll let you clean my room.
The white whale?
Think about how many dust bunnies are under my bed, how many stray socks.
- Hey, Schmidt, I got you something.
- ls that a boutique box?
A pair of grey, shiny, twill, flat-front trousers designed by a man named Calvin.
Never been tried on.
Pockets are sewn shut.
Don't you just want to get your thumbs in there and rip?
Okay, so I'm just going to leave this on your bongo drum and you can, you know give them a whirl if you feel like it.
Just make the right decision.
Come on.
Take the pants.
Oh, come here.
Calvin.
You magnificent wizard.
Schmidty.
Nick, your hair is doing that thing that I just hate.
Jess, could you ask Winston to move the furniture?
He could use exercise.
You're looking a little, you know - He's back.
SCHMlDT: And Nick, Winston we have a urinal, how are you still missing?
Schmidt.
Schmidt.
Wake up.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
- What - Okay.
are you doing here?
What do you think I'm doing here?
Come on.
SCHMlDT: Okay.
Wait, wait, wait.
- What?
Cece, before we continue I clearly have no control in this relationship and I'm fine with it.
- Good.
- But know this you're the one who broke in at 3 a. m. for a little bit of Schmidt - so who's really in control?
- Shut up.
Wait, oh, are you sleeping in dress pants?
What, they're slacks.
What's the big deal?
Calm down.
- Look how excited Hector Jay is to see you.
Yeah, I've met Hector Jay.
SCHMlDT: Look, he's knighting you.
Stop knighting me.
SCHMlDT : Lady Cecilia.
Schmidt, I'm gonna leave.
SCHMlDT: You have entered the Order of the Round Table.
Oh, I'm gonna stay.
SCHMlDT: Dame Nasty Cece.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Buying a phone is a big deal.
Think how long you'll have this thing.
It's like buying a car or a bra.
Eight years, man.
Ow.
Hey, sorry, I was just checking your credit score and I got this number that's crazily low.
- I'll try again.
- Don't bother.
I'm sure it's right.
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?
Two-fifty?
You get 150 just for being alive.
Hey, Mojan, we got a 250 credit score!
I guess the $40 I saved on that Gap card didn't pay off.
Do you have a box of charity phones you're sending to Africa?
- Can he have one?
Claire.
Brendan.
- This guy's got a 250 credit score.
- They're bringing everybody out?
- Look at this.
- There, 250.
Oh, I'm sorry, I've been doing this a long time.
I've just never seen a score this low.
Did you just wake up from a coma?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess  You've always wanted a thing.
This could be your thing.
- Like, "the guy with no phone".
NlCK: Well, who is that guy?
- I don't wanna be that guy.
No, no.
It's mysterious.
It's like, "l wanna call Nick Miller".
"You can't.
He doesn't have a phone".
"What"?
You can go Ghost Protocol on everyone.
See, that's cool.
I always wanted to be a mole person.
Schmidt, you're the Michael Jordan of bar trivia.
We were in the Greek mythology zone.
You knew every question.
SCHMlDT: Perseus, lcarus, Medusa.
Medus-deuce.
Guys, you're shouting.
You knew every answer.
What was the tiebreaker you got?
- Calvin Coolidge's birthplace?
- Little Plymouth Notch, son.
- Wow.
I'm done with this.
Shelby, wanna - How did you know that?
Question: How do you forget that?
Answer: You don't.
- Jar!
I'm gonna jar myself on that one.
Boom.
I mean, he's like a trivia god.
Winston, don't worry about it, man.
It's your public school education.
You'll catch up.
Jar again.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, hi.
Yeah, hi.
I'm Russell Schiller, Sarah's dad.
- We spoke on the phone.
- Oh, yes.
I'm Jessica Day.
- Did you just curtsy?
- I did, yes.
I did.
- ls this a bad time?
- Nope.
No, no, no.
I was just cleaning up from the Sexual Health class.
I had to take condoms off 30 cucumbers, and condoms are harder to take off than I thought.
I know how to put them on, but not how to take them off.
I guess someone else has always done it for me.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just got off a flight from London.
Maybe I'm a little out of it.
Oh, London.
Did you have a busy sch-- Schedule?
Did you have fun?
No, I was advising a merger.
Oh, fair enough.
You wanted to talk to me about Sarah's art.
So this is one of the pieces she did.
- Um - Oh.
That one is called At the Mall With Grandma.
She made it in dream-cess which is where I let the kids have time to create something.
Sarah's gonna opt out of dream-cess from now on.
She'll use that same time to review her other schoolwork with a tutor.
Oh.
Did you talk to Sarah about this?
I don't need to.
I want her to know fractions before high school.
I follow the curriculum.
My daughter is wearing dolls' heads around her neck.
So whatever you're doing, keep it up.
I talk to your daughter every single day.
Do you?
Because hiring a tutor is not the same thing - as spending time with her.
- I'm her father, not her friend.
I know what she needs.
Give my best to Mrs. Monogamy.
He's the third largest donor in the city.
We take his money and then what?
We answer to him?
- You're asking me to give up my integrity?
- Yes.
We need his money.
So he pulls his donation.
You know what?
I'll raise the money myself.
I'll get a ragtag group of kids together.
A lost soul an orphan a Jewish kid with a keyboard a little slut who can dance and one fatso.
And I'll choreograph some dances and make a show.
You did that already.
It's called the spring musical.
It brought in $60.
- Please don't make me apologize.
- You're gonna go to his office.
Say that you were wrong.
Say you're never gonna let the kids do anything creative ever again.
From now on, your classroom is full-on North Korea.
Math, math, math!
Make sure he doesn't pull the donation.
When he was yelling, did he do that thing with his mouth?
You know, that little smile thing?
You know, like-- Like, where he goes, "Mm".
- That's really weird, Tanya.
- Apologize.
- Why'd you make me look stupid last night?
- Wait, what?
Which of the five Great Lakes is located entirely in the United States?
- Lake Erie?
- lf Lake Michigan didn't exist and we won a fictional U.S.- Canada war.
- Lake Michigan.
- Correct.
Another point.
- Nice.
- Boom.
Want me to take a dive next time?
- Take a dive?
- You know pretend you know more than me when Shelby's around so it seems like you're smarter.
You'd do the same thing for me.
Wow.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You think because you know facts about Princess Kate - that you're smarter?
- First, Kate is a duchess.
And whip-smart, by all accounts.
Second of all, don't be so prideful.
Look, man, there's nothing wrong with being the second smartest.
Let me take that back.
- Jess is a teacher of children.
- You memorize facts.
I can memorize facts.
- That doesn't make you smart.
- Okay, well, maybe but I'm definitely smarter than you.
Whew.
Glutes are done.
I'm gonna go to the stairwell.
Work on my calves.
- Come with?
- Hell, no.
You sure?
I need to grovel.
I hate groveling.
I would've lasted two seconds in the court of the Sun King.
I think about that all the time.
- You do?
- Know how much I grovel on a daily basis?
It is literally obscene.
But come the weekend I'm the one who's filling up my cart with Fila, Nautica, lmpulse Fila, Hilfiger - CK, BR leather cuff, and more Fila.
- This is the problem, Jess.
It's rich people.
We are right where they want us, Jess.
Just suckling on the teat of consumerism.
- Yeah.
- The reason I got rid of my phone.
You were denied a cell phone because you have the credit score of a homeless ghost.
- lt doesn't matter.
- You weigh more than your credit score.
I'm here now, and I'm loving it.
I'm the guy with no phone.
I mean, right now, I'm writing a letter to my friend Kev seeing if he wants to party with me this Friday.
"What up, Kev?
You in?
Nick Miller".
Yeah, Nick, he might pull the funding from the school so I'm a bit-- Blame your period.
I've actually done this before.
I mean, both parties knew that I was lying, obviously but it didn't matter because they knew that I had utterly humiliated myself.
And at the end of the day, they respected that.
I'm sorry, I just feel like someone should suggest a simple apology.
I know that's not where we're headed, but I'm just gonna go on record and say I think you should apologize, like a human.
No, no, I'm going with Nick because I don't think I have to apologize.
Yeah, just so march into his office and say, "Hey, Mr. Fancyman you can't tell me what to do.
Your money doesn't own me".
And then throw away your phone.
I'll throw my phone in the fiery chasm where he keeps his poor people.
Actually, scratch that.
My mom's got your number in case of emergency.
I want her to think that I can bring something to the table.
I care about this girl, Elvin.
I want her to be my girlfriend.
She sees me, all she sees is a part-time nanny.
That's a - You are a part-time nanny.
- I want her to think I'm smart.
What about fake glasses?
It worked for me.
Okay, okay, I'm on my way to his office, and I have a speech I wrote for Fancyman.
- I wanna practice it.
- Why are you listening to Nick?
- It's a horrible idea.
- Ghost Protocol, man.
You're using my phone.
It's not Ghost Protocol.
It's you using my phone.
This is a group call.
I'm talking in my living room and it happens to go into that box.
I'm gonna start with a quote against Social Darwinism discuss the Gilded Age, the robber barons, the Great Society how we ended up with a huge wealth disparity in this country then I end with a bluegrass version of Public Enemy's "Fight the Power".
NlCK: Bad finish.
SCHMlDT: What is that?
- Are you driving a lawn mower?
- No, I just--  Come on!
- My car.
NlCK: Look, this is a great opportunity.
You need to ask yourself where are you even going?
SCHMlDT: Buy a new car.
NlCK: You don't need a car.
Oh, my car stalled out.
Can you guys come and help me push it?
Yeah, yeah, we'll be down in a few minutes.
Hey, can I help you?
- What?
Oh, hi.
Uh-- Mr. Schiller.
- How'd you know I was here?
- Driving by, I saw you.
My office is right here.
Oh.
Oh.
What a coincidence.
I had no idea.
- Weird.
- What's wrong with the car?
- The guy sounds like a matinee idol.
- Shut up, Schmidt.
I'm just pushing it to the nearest gas station.
It's a mile away, so I'm fine.
I know a guy.
He'll be here in 10.
- Oh, no, Mr. Schiller.
- Russell.
I can take care of myself.
It's how I was raised.
I wasn't raised with money.
When something broke, we pretended it worked.
Some of my best memories are pushing this car around on family vacations.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, tow truck's on the way.
Look, that's very nice and generous of you, but I really-- I mean, I need my car and Here, let me help you.
Take mine.
- What?
- Take mine.
- Here.
- No.
- Come on, take mine.
- I don't know how to drive cars that work.
Drop it off tomorrow.
I'm having a party.
Cookout.
Come on over anytime.
Come on.
Thank you so much.
This is amazing.
I will return it washed tomorrow.
- Do you think it's a superhero?
- No.
I think it's Jess and some weird guy.
- Miss Day?
- Jess.
You can call me Jess.
Great.
I'll see you tomorrow, Jess.
Go is the one on the right.
The one on the left is stop.
Thanks.
- What kind of car?
An SL?
Push ignition?
- We are the 99 percent.
We are the 99 - percent.
SCHMlDT: Push ignition?
Tell me it's not a hybrid.
And then he gives me his car, just hands me the keys.
It's, like, so, ugh Rich people, they're always giving you their cars.
It's like "let them eat cars".
You know what he's doing.
He's taking back the power.
So I have to go to his cookout, and instead of standing up to him - I have to grovel.
- Just a thought.
What if he likes you?
- Ugh.
No, I hate him.
- This guy is single and he's sweet.
Sweet?
No.
He's not sweet.
I would never go for that guy.
- Why?
- Because he's the type of guy who has a linen closet and a towel warmer.
You know me.
I'm only attracted to guys who are afraid of success and think someone famous stole their idea.
I like an underdog.
- Spencer didn't even own sheets.
- Yeah.
He slept on a pile of washcloths.
Can I say something you're not gonna like?
- No.
- Maybe Russell intimidates you because you wouldn't take care of him.
He'd take care of you - and that just terrifies you.
- Uh, no.
Spencer wore jellies.
How many pounds in a metric ton?
Two thousand two hundred and four point six.
Next.
- ln 1948, Albert became the first what-- - American monkey in space.
Let's go.
- This ancient-- - Mesopotamia.
Hit me.
You didn't actually know what a Mesopotamia is.
Of course I know what Mesopotamia is.
Don't be crazy.
Use it in a sentence.
Look, there's Mesopotamia.
I'm gonna have to draw on your hatred of rich people for this, okay?
- Hate me up.
NlCK: Well, for starters, look at this place.
I know.
Ugh.
NlCK: I'm betting at one point there was a moat.
- Rich boy punk.
Heh, heh.
NlCK This hallway is excessive.
It's braggy.
I guess everyone's out back.
Ugh.
Look at this place, Jess.
Are you kidding me?
So over-the-top.
A kitchen island?
Be a man.
Let your counter attach to itself.
It's like, "l can't chop vegetables here, I need to do it here.
Love me, love me".
We're making an egg, not going to outer space, guys.
Right.
Nice burn.
Whoa.
Makes me wanna sit by the fire and talk about how annoying Gandhi is.
Whoa.
Something's happening to me, Jess.
I wanna sit at that desk and veto a law.
What are you doing?
That's someone's stuff.
I put my hand on this desk, I feel sexually proficient for the first time in my life.
Nick, this man stands for everything you hate.
I'm President Miller!
You're all fired!
And bring our boys home.
Okay, this is how evil geniuses are born.
Smell that?
It smells like leather and Teddy Roosevelt and wistfulness.
I wanna wear this cap.
You're not helping me.
Nick, I know this room is beautiful gentlemanly and it smells like Christmas, but you have to stay strong.
I'm gonna go find Russell.
Keep playing with that duck.
I wanna kill you because I respect you.
I think I understand hunting!
- Hello, Russell.
- Hey, Jess.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, the mechanic called.
Your car is done.
He also wanted me to communicate to you that you need to change your oil.
I wanna, first of all, say thank you, Russell.
Second of all, I want to say I know you donate a lot of money to the school but-- - You think I'm a snob.
- No, no, no.
I have nothing against people who live in enormous mansions.
Jess, I'm 42.
I've made a lot of money and I enjoy spending it.
- You gotta try one of these.
- Oh.
Deconstructed spring roll.
It's delicious.
- Oh.
- Try it.
Oh, my God.
This is so amazing I wanna punch you.
Russell.
Russell, come tell Caroline about that time you delivered that baby.
- Oh.
Yeah.
- You delivered a baby?
It was twins, actually.
- Twins?
- Are you wearing my sweater?
- No.
Yes.
It was on the back of the chair.
I thought the sweater belonged to it.
I thought it was a chair sweater.
Those exist.
- I'm Nick.
- You know Jess.
I'm Jess's roommate.
I'm the guy with no phone, if she's told you.
My thing.
- Why don't you have a phone?
- I don't wanna be tied to a corporate system.
And no one would give me one.
Low credit rating.
Yeah.
When I was your age, I had a skinny ponytail and I think I was living off of selling my own blood.
That's funny.
Then what happened?
One day you woke up and you had this?
Well, I realized I wanted to grow up.
That's what happened.
I got this as a gift from the company for Christmas.
Oh, wow.
That's great.
My boss gave me three credit cards he found at the bar and said, "You didn't get these from me".
Heh, heh.
It's a bartender joke.
I'm a bartender.
We don't steal credit cards.
Cool, cool.
- Here.
Take it.
- No, no.
I can't take your phone.
It just-- It feels really good in my hand.
Is it possible to be sexually attracted to an object?
Yes, it is.
It really is.
You can keep the sweater.
Thanks.
I don't know why I put it on, to be honest with you.
I just came in here and it smelled like Shakespeare.
If Shakespeare were a damn cowboy.
And hawk's nest and boat fuel and cigars and bourbon.
Man stuff.
- Thank you.
I appreciate it.
- Yeah, sure.
Hey, Russell, why are you being so nice to me?
Well, you're Jess' friend, right?
Now, you fold that sweater.
Don't hang it.
You listening to me?
Fold it.
I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
Heh, heh.
That was really funny, man!
Why did l?
Bidet if I do.
Yup, yup, yup.
Oh, my God.
Aah!
Aah!
- Oh, my God.
Shut up.
Jess, is that you?
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
What do I press?
What's wrong?
Sorry, Jess, I'm coming in.
- Oh, my God.
- What's going on?
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Oh, my.
- I just pressed some buttons - with cartoon characters.
- It's Japanese.
Of course it's a Japanese bidet.
Of course you have a Japanese bidet.
Look, Russell, I wanna tell you that I am not sorry about what I said because Sarah is 12 and she is creative.
And I don't care if you pull your donation I am not gonna grovel.
Why'd you think I would pull the donation?
I would never do that.
Okay.
Oh, jeez.
You did some really deep cleaning here.
Oh, God.
- Jess.
Jess, wait.
Jess, you put it up to six happy faces.
I've never gone past three.
Jess, why are we leaving?
And why are you all wet?
You take a bath in his tub because you wanted to see what it'd feel like to be him?
I get that.
No.
I wanna leave because we don't fit in here, Nick.
I know I've been saying don't give in to this guy but I don't think you should run from him.
Because no matter where you go, he could find you.
I believe that.
- No, running's good.
I'm gonna run.
- Jess, stop.
Look, this may complicate things - but I'm in love with him.
- Shut up.
I won't shut up.
He smells like strong coffee and going to see a man about a horse.
- You're ridiculous, Nick.
Let's go.
- I am ridiculous, okay?
But no.
Be a grown-up.
He likes you, Jess.
Go back in there.
I think it'd be good for you.
And I'm not just saying that because I'm in love with him.
Just do it.
Don't be intimidated because you're younger poorer and wetter than everybody in there.
Goldfinger.
No, I meant to say Golden Hinde.
Golden Hinde is what I meant to say.
- Ooh.
No.
- Winston, you are all over the place.
The Green Bay Packers did not invent the T formation nor was Crispin Glover the first to die in the Revolutionary War.
- This is supposed to be fun.
- I don't wanna look stupid - in front of everybody.
- You're not.
Well, I mean, he did skip Earth when listing the planets.
What has gotten into you today?
I just didn't want you to think I was an idiot.
You tried to memorize all the trivia answers?
Winston, I don't want some smart, rich guy who owns his own car.
I want to be with you.
I don't care if you don't know Ernest Hemingway's birthplace.
Oak Park, lllinois.
So, what are you saying?
Are we doing this?
Is this real?
Like, are you my girlfriend?
Because if that's what you're saying, that would make me very happy.
Mm.
Me too.
Shelby, be careful with his mustache, please.
It's very delicate.
I can't watch this anymore.
Winston, I hope you're better in bed because your street work is embarrassing.
Am I talking too much?
I don't wanna ruin the moment.
Know what?
If this was my grandmother's building, she'd be outside on the patio and she'd be yelling down at you, saying:  "You look beautiful.
The two of you are a beautiful couple.
I'm glad you found one another".
But she wouldn't invite you up because she's a horrible racist.
You want me to put on some Jodeci?
- Hey, there you are.
I was looking for you.
- Okay.
Listen.
I'm not used to people who have it all together.
I think - you scare me.
- Oh, no.
I don't I don't have it all together.
I don't even know how to talk to my own kid.
I can't remember last time she hugged me using both arms.
She said she wanted to go bra shopping and so I bought her a ski vest.
Look, every eye roll means you're doing something right.
- Really?
- No, that's what I tell parents to make them feel better.
Jess, will you have dinner with me?
- Yes.
- Great.
Good.
- Should l, um, text you, or-- ?
- No.
I'll call.
Great.
- Okay, cool.
- All right, cool.
Oh, no.
- Jess!
Why are you in the koi pond?
Jess, are you okay?
Come here.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Koi in my dress!
- Koi in my dress!
Aah!
Are you all right?
- Oh, you got a fish in your dress.
Oh!
I didn't ask you!
I'm talking to you.
You wanna come in here and charge me a billion dollars?
That's nothing to me!
You want it?
You want it?
You're off the streets.
I don't want to either.
You're the best cop I got.
This is President Miller of Earth.
I'd like to speak to the galactic emperor, please.
Yeah, it's about money.
I'll push a piece of paper across the desk I've written a little number on.
Why don't I just tell you?
It's $5 kabillion.
So, what do you say?
Is China mine, Mr. Ying?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Nick, your houseguest is urinating in the bathroom Tony the Tiger style.
- Naked with a kerchief?
What?
Naked with a kerchief.
No.
What do you call top, no pants?
That's a Winnie the Pooh.
Or a Paddington.
WlNSTON: Donald Duck.
SCHMlDT: I guess pretty much any bear.
- Except Yogi.
That's naked with a tie.
- Alvin, Simon, Theodore.
I saw his entire butt.
Dirk's a good guy.
My roommate when I was in law school.
- Smartest guy I know.
- So he's a lawyer?
No.
But he has a law degree, business degree.
And a master's in agriculture.
He's kind of like a degree collector.
- He's getting his PhD in poetry, so - That sucks for poems.
How'd it go with Fancyman?
It was an amazing first date.
Except for one awkward part at the end.
I don't go on dates very often.
Guys my age always want to skip the date and just go right for the gold.
Which I don't give them because I'm stingy with my gold.
Unless they dig for it.
I haven't even gotten to the awkward part yet.
Oh.
Hi.
Black sedan?
Yeah.
What?
So he patted me on the back.
I thought I'd at least get a front pat.
Hoohah!
- What?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Look, he probably got nervous.
- No.
Russell's never nervous.
That's the worst answer.
Winston?
What do you think?
- Oh, thank God.
Hey, what's up, baby?
NlCK: Hey, is that Shelby?
- Reer!
- What's that?
Cat sound.
Oh, because you did the whip, we should-- Guys.
Okay, I'm just gonna ask Cece.
But next time you guys want advice about girls, don't come crawling to me.
- Got it.
- Sounds good.
No, that was a joke.
I love it when you ask me stuff, it makes me feel important.
- And I love it when-- - One shade the more, one ray the less Had half impaired the nameless grace - Are you wearing a lady's scarf?
- Come to my lecture tomorrow night.
Absolutely not.
She's missing out, my man.
Schmidt.
Borrow your car, take Shelby to the airport?
Oh, I don't have a car, Winston.
Hey, Schmidt, uh, you mind if I use the - man-bulance?
- Man-bulance is resting.
To get ready for the team-building retreat Monday.
I'm sure the man-bulance couldn't handle Shelby's luggage anyway.
What is wrong with you, Winston?
The man-bulance fits the luggage of nine Shelbys.
It has the towing capacity of a thousand Shelbys.
You know what, here you go, Winston.
There.
Enjoy luxury.
All good, man.
I got your second set, so thank you.
- How'd you get my keys?
- Someone left your door open.
Someone left your face beautiful.
- Who is that?
- Apparently his name is Dirk.
Sorry, Dirk, I'm seeing somebody.
But should that stop you from seeing this?
- Yeah.
That's awesome.
- Does he keep you happy?
- He does what he's told.
DlRK: Yeah.
So you're the boss and he's your little secretary?
- Oh, your sex-cretary.
- I am definitely the boss.
Sex-cretary, he just made that up.
JESS : Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess I hate bachelorette parties.
I have 50 different penis items in my carry-on.
If this plane goes down there's going to be sharks doing weird stuff.
- I thought you were going to Vegas?
- No.
Mexico.
I thought I told you that.
Well, if you don't want me to go, I don't have to go.
No, no, no.
I want you to go.
It'll be good.
We've spent the last five nights together.
I mean, you know, we both could use some space.
Right.
- Did I say something wrong?
- I'm sorry.
I couldn't hear you across all the space.
Hey.
Great news.
Um, Jess is taking a shower.
Okay, I just need like, a good, solid 10 minutes.
Eat this granola bar first.
I want to try something called the horse trough.
No, Cece.
I'm not having sex with you right now.
I have to get everybody in a version of "We Didn't Start the Fire".
Totally fine, what do you need, like 20 minutes?
Cece, this-- Okay, this is real work.
For my real boss.
Who is not you.
Oh, I get what's happening here.
It's because Ponytail called you a "sex receptionist"?
A sex receptionist answers calls all day.
A sex-cretary does scheduling, light filing, basically runs the office.
So first of all, thank you for the demotion.
- Second of all, I quit.
- So I'll see you tonight.
- Did you not hear anything I just said?
- Oh, no I totally heard you, loud and clear.
But do you know who didn't happen to hear you?
What are you doing?
Don't-- Don't involve them.
- Oh, my-- - They just didn't hear.
- Don't bring them into this.
- Don't tell me, tell them.
SCHMlDT: Damn it.
Hi.
Hi, guys.
Harold.
Kumar.
I love you both.
Oh, the zany adventures we've had.
But we can't go to White Castle today.
Just can't do it.
You're serious about this?
Cece?
Is Schmidt bothering you?
This is not over.
Okay?
- Was it like a caress or like a pat?
- No, like a pat.
It was distinctly a pat.
It was kind of hot.
That man knows how to pat a back.
At any point during the night did you do your Kermit the Frog imitation?
Maybe once or twice.
Stop.
It freaks me out, you know.
What do I do?
I really, really want to see him again.
Like, badly.
- Just call him.
- I can't.
He's too sophisticated.
He told me he'd run with the bulls.
And I quote, "Not the touristy bulls in Pamplona".
Big deal.
Just call him.
Schmidt says the moment a woman touches a phone, she loses her power.
Unless she's sexting, in which case she gains a half-power.
That's Schmidt just talking-- What does Schmidt know?
Look, all the guys that you live with, boys.
You've only dated boys.
Russell is a grown man.
I bet he likes women who know what they want and ask for it.
He has a hot-air balloon in a hangar in Palm Springs.
Sweetheart, you are sophisticated.
You just gotta pick up the phone, and you ask him out for dinner.
You know what, you're right.
I am sophisticated.
I'm gonna do this.
- What is that?
- It's a phone.
Oh, God.
Thus ends our journey through the words of time.
From Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan.
From Dylan to Dylan.
They're both named Dylan.
- Watch him bring it home.
- I have to?
We have to rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And when the light is no longer bright.
Don't think twice, it's all right.
It's over.
Smartest guy I know.
Professor?
- Professor?
- Yeah.
We wanted to remind you about the wine and cheese event.
The soiree, eh?
Super classy.
Crackers, bubbles, crab, hummus.
I e-mailed you about that.
That was me.
Sometimes when I get a really long e-mail I don't read it.
Oh, mommy.
All right, Dirk, what about Deb?
- You guys having problems or something?
- No, no, no, everything's fine.
She left me and moved out of the house.
I guess it was "too hard" to support me.
"Financially".
It's all fine.
Allowed me to realize the one thing that was missing in my life.
- Scarves?
- Undergraduate ladies.
Girls our age, what do they want?
They want us to wed them.
Sire their children.
They want you to have a bed frame.
They want you to eat off plates.
Girls in college all they want you to do is tell them that their photography has potential.
Don't they hang out with guys their own age?
Hung with a 20-year-old dude lately?
Trust me, they are setting the bar very, very low.
Haven't gone through their gay phase yet.
I'm gonna call Shelby and see if everything's all right.
- Sounds good, man.
- What, dude?
Relax.
Okay?
I just said we're giving space.
Doesn't mean I can't call her to see if anything funny happened on the plane.
You know what space means, right?
Space to have sex with other people.
No, space means you go to Mexico and you do not have sex with other people.
Watch this.
Nick, don't give me any space.
You got it, my man.
See, this makes it pretty hard for you and I to have sex right now.
Now, Nick, I want you to give me some space.
All this space allows me the opportunity to have as much sex as we want.
- Smartest guy I know.
- See how much sex?
That does not-- Get out of my way, bookworms!
Ready to make love to some college chicks?
- When is the last time you had mono?
- Don't know.
Tomorrow you're gonna say yesterday.
I have that team-building research you asked for, Mr. Schmidt.
What are you wearing?
I don't-- I don't know.
I found this at the lost-and-found at the gym.
I'm not quite sure how sexy a sex-cretary is supposed to be.
Never had to do this.
I've never had to seduce somebody before.
If you're gonna seduce me, don't dress up like my Aunt Frieda at seder.
Come on, okay?
I will do anything.
And I'll do it anywhere.
All right?
Even Fantasy Location Number Three?
Okay.
Um How good are the Beatles?
The Beatles are the best.
- Were you so upset when they broke up?
- I would've been.
But I was 1.
Heh.
Well, you're not 1 anymore.
Heh.
How's your prostate?
I had my breast exam last weekend.
Like, they're fine.
It's just boob in there.
But we have to be careful.
Our bodies are decaying.
Are you okay?
You seem strange.
Why didn't we kiss the other night?
Sorry.
- I am sorry.
- No, it's fine.
Oh!
- What?
Is everything okay?
- I gotta go.
This ought to take care of that.
Dinner, okay?
Oh, I cannot believe I almost left without-- Here, there's cab fare.
Get home safe.
Baby, I don't want anyone to have space.
I want to be standing right in front of you.
I want the air that you breathe to be the air coming directly from out of my mouth.
I want to pass air back and forth between each other until it's mostly carbon dioxide and then we both pass out and die.
No flights.
Hey, Schmidt, you mind if I borrow your car again?
"Of course you can, Winston, you're so great".
Thank you!
I find myself in my new Cadillac Hello, my name is Nicholas.
Nick.
Nick.
Buddy, nobody ever regretted throwing an after party.
Oh, I do.
Look, I feel so old here.
Is calling a girl "shorty" still cool?
We gotta find your angle with these girls.
Your hook.
Your panty-melter.
Usually my hook is that it's closing time and I'm there.
You were a panty-melting icon in law school.
If panties were snowmen, you were March, bro.
- Hey.
NlCK: Don't do that.
DlRK: Skyler.
Miriam.
Come over here.
NlCK: Don't humiliate me.
- How cool is my friend?
- Are you a professor too?
- No, no, no.
I'm a bartender.
Who's 30 years old.
I don't have health insurance.
You know how to make drinks?
Panty-melter.
Do I know how to make drinks?
- Yeah, like alcoholic drinks?
- Yeah, I do that professionally.
You could get me drunk professionally?
- Are you a cop?
Ha-ha-ha.
- Sometimes.
- Do you have identification on you?
- Ha-ha-ha.
I gotta call Jenna and tell her I'm making out with a bartender.
Five nights a week.
- Jess!
You made it to the party!
- What's going on?
Why is the cast of The Social Network in our apartment?
Dirk is a genius.
Twenty-year-old girls, they think I'm awesome.
And look at them.
They don't know what Saved by the Bell is and they've never felt pain.
I'm Skyler's Fancyman!
Can you believe it?
Where's your Fancyman?
I don't know.
It was horrible.
He left and he gave me $100 for a cab.
And you know what?
I'm gonna use the remaining 90 to get out of here and start a new life.
It's been nice knowing you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm gonna die alone.
- Oh, no.
- I am so, so sad right now.
- Oh!
My heart hurts.
Want Nick to make you a Bayberry Breeze?
He is so smart.
- So smart.
- Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm not happy!
Thirty sucks!
Weird party move.
You and I defying gravity With you and I defying gravity  It's been two hours.
This is officially crazy.
- Also, I have to go to the bathroom.
-  Just pee yourself.
So you'd rather sit in urine for the rest of the ride than admit that we're sleeping together?
Yep.
Absolutely.
Don't even have to think about it.
I don't wanna ruin what we have, okay?
Because if people find out, they're gonna have a lot of questions like: "Cece, why are you sleeping with him"?
And, "Seriously, why"?
You think we have something to ruin?
Earlier, I was dressed as a sex-cretary.
And I was wearing shoulder pads.
So I obviously must like sleeping with you.
Secre-tarty.
Shut up.
This is pretty great.
- I'm freezing.
- Yeah.
I'm so cold.
How are you not freezing?
Does your brown skin retain heat?
From becoming popular Lar   Take out your tampon and drink, Trevor!
The Flip Queen has spoken!
ALL : Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
- Shelby.
Babe, I don't want space.
SHELBY : Neither do I. That's why I'm at your apartment.
- I got on a plane.
I wanted to see you.
- What?
Babe, look.
I'm in Mexico.
I came to see you.
- Are you serious?
- I miss you, Shelby.
You're so sexy, girl.
In or out of the wig.
I don't care.
Shelby, you make me feel so brave.
And I've never felt like this about anybody else before.
I love you.
And I carry your soul-song with me wherever I go.
I love you too.
I'm coming back, baby.
No space.
You traveling with any non-U.S. citizens?
You actually catch people with that line?
No, sir.
Just me and my American heart full of love.
Then how do you explain this?
I can't, sir.
No one in the entire world can explain that.
I'm so tall.
I feel like a Chinese basketball player.
Russell?
Oh - Hey, Jess.
- I'm not Jess.
I'm her cousin Sylvia.
You doing okay?
I want a donut.
Let's get you a donut.
Please.
I wanna talk to you.
Alone.
Well, this is a fun group.
Drop me off at my dorm?
The Hamilton.
I'd like to vomit now.
Yes!
I've never jumped out of a moving car before!
That was badass!
- Hey, Nick, that's the road.
- Okay.
What's up?
- You want the woods.
- Woods.
You're smart.
- Come here.
- lt was nothing.
NlCK: You're okay, Russ.
- Okay.
We can hug some more later.
This isn't her, you know.
She's not like us.
She's one of the good ones.
Time to make the puke, Russell.
So listen, man, it's really important to us that our equal sexual relationship where neither one of us has the upper hand, remain a secret.
And, while I respect the fact that you listen to Wicked while you're alone I can use that information against you at any point in time.
There's a stop sign.
- ls that a stop sign?
SCHMlDT: You probably wanna slow down.
Maybe it's a go sign.
SCHMlDT: I don't think it's a go sign.
Because if somebody like you is sleeping with somebody like her then maybe the whole damn world is upside down.
It's just what I'm thinking.
I wanna talk to you.
I wanna have a chance to explain.
That's okay.
I understand.
I thought you wanted a sophisticated lady, but now I realize that you like dating younger girls because we think you're cool.
And you know what?
It's working because I think you're a hottie with a body.
Um I didn't ask you out because you're younger than me.
I asked you out because I like you.
But I've forgotten really how to do this, you know.
I haven't dated since 1989 when I took her to the picture show in my buggy.
the year that I learned to use the toaster by myself.
The text I got at dinner was from my ex-wife.
Sarah's with her this week and I didn't pack her inhaler.
She had an asthma attack.
- ls Sarah okay?
- Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.
I just feel like I should've explained.
I really wanted to kiss you the other night.
- Really?
- I wanted to do more than kiss you.
I'd like to do you at some point.
Like, you know, really give it to you good.
But I've forgotten how to tell whether it's the right moment.
- I was nervous.
- You were nervous?
Nick was right.
He can be really wise sometimes.
NlCK: Oh, my God.
It's happening!
It's coming.
I think I'm dying.
I feel scared and excited.
What do you think?
What do I think of what?
- Do you think now is the right moment?
- I think so.
Good.
NlCK: Get out of me, you poison.
Is that your hand?
No.
That's my hand.
- Oh, my God.
- You're welcome.
- Get out of here, Dirk.
- You get out.
Come here.
Hey!
Oh, no.
Where are you guys?
- Hello?
NlCK: Hey, where are you guys?
Could I have walked out into the mountains?
When does a hill become a mountain?
It just happened.
- I'm so cold.
DlRK: Who is this?
Oh, my God, Dirk is dead.
Dirk is dead!
Smartest guy I knew.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Are you ready to run?
I have my playlist all ready.
Actually, it's Diane Keaton's autobiography she just filmed First Wives Club, and it's getting me pumped!
- I totally forgot we were gonna run today.
- I e-mailed you three times!
- Maybe you typed "g-moil" again.
- No excuses, we have to train.
We signed up for this, now we have to do it.
Why can't we just donate the money?
We do we have to run the six miles first?
That's a good point, but no, you're getting dressed-- No, Jess, look, I can't go, I'm super hungover right now plus, Masha had a crisis, she accidentally ate a cookie because she fell on it.
- I am devastated.
- She's devastated.
- Why don't you come running with us?
- No, she definitely can't.
It's great, more money for charity!
We will do it tomorrow!
lt'll be so fun!
I mean, that was a close one.
Good thing I'm a quiet breather I learned that as a kid playing "Who passed out"?
with my mom.
- My mom always won.
- Jew in the couch.
Jew in the couch.
- Nadia.
American manners.
- I sorry.
So Jew person in couch.
She's not wrong.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess  Okay.
Bye, Nick.
So you'll call me?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I'll definitely do--  - Are you okay?
- I'm gonna call you.
You hike?
Do you hike?
- Okay?
Are you-- ?
NlCK: This was fun.
Okay.
Okay, I'll call you tonight - to make sure you're okay.
- Please.
That was ridiculous.
I can't do this, Winston.
I don't know how to sleep with and for a couple of weeks, that's all I've been doing.
- What's going on with you, are you okay?
- I saw something a few days ago.
Now, I've been sworn to secrecy, but it is just too big-- I know where you're going, you know I can't keep a secret, you saw me with that girl.
Thinking about secrets turns me into a Slip 'N Slide.
- You gotta help me out, I'm dying!
Hey, hey!
NlCK: I don't wanna know!
- Come on, come on, come on, I'm dying!
- I don't wanna know!
I don't wanna know!
Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!
Ew.
- It's happening under our roof.
- No.
- Yes.
Yes!
- No!
- This makes me hate things.
- I know, man, it's like up is down.
- Up is the new down, man.
- Now my back is sweating.
- All right, who knows?
- Everybody but Jess.
Hey.
Hey, Jess.
Just hanging out in the hallway.
What's going on?
Nothing's going on.
I'm really annoyed, Cece bailed on me again - we were supposed to train for that race-- - That is so Cece!
I know.
I mean, and the weird thing is that she said she was hungover but last night, she said she didn't want to go out.
Maybe she had a guy over.
Not like that, I didn't say anything.
Think about what I said, I didn't say anything.
You have a secret.
You have a secret!
Turn around.
- You turn around.
Be cool about this.
- Let me see your back.
Ew.
Gross!
J'accuse, Miller!
J'accuse.
- You fold like a lawn chair.
Fold.
Fold.
- You're not gonna fold me.
- Cece and Schmidt are sleeping together!
- Come on!
What?
Oh, my God!
WlNSTON: They know, Schmidt.
Sweatback?
You told Sweatback?
Come on, Winston!
- Jess - God.
I am so sorry that you had to hear about this like this.
But can we just take a moment to celebrate me?
Schmidty did it this time.
I mean, I'm having lndian every night.
- No!
No!
Aah!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Ow!
Jess, I'm really sorry you found out this way.
Trust me, it wasn't some big conspiracy, just something that happened and then it got out of control, like poison oak, and I just - couldn't stop scratching it.
That's - Cece started it.
I did, I started it.
Why, Cece?
Are you trying to get back at your parents?
- When did it start?
- Jess, I want to emphasize that we are not dating.
I can't stress that enough.
This is just sex.
- Mm-hm.
When did it start?
- One-oh-three a. m. February 15th.
Right on schedule.
- lt was two months ago.
- Two months?
Two moons have passed since you started doing it?
You talk like a Native American when you're angry.
- Two moons have passed!
- Just a quick side bar - we've done it in every room of the apartment.
- Ugh.
- Even my room?
Oh, God.
- Just the one time.
- How long have you known?
- A few days.
You didn't tell me either?
Reminder, I told you seconds after I knew.
- Because you're weak, Nick.
Weak.
- Okay, I agree, just chill, stop yelling.
Jess, I want to tell you everything, what do you want to know?
Cece, how would I know if you're telling the truth?
Come on, Jess, are you seriously mad?
No.
No.
I'm not.
I'm really glad you two are having fun.
How cool is that?
For what it's worth, I think what I did was really brave.
- Get off of me.
- Yeah.
Have you guys seen a scarf?
Holly said she left it here.
It's my favorite because it's a circle, so you never have to think about which end goes on the right or the left.
My therapist gave it to me.
She's Asian but she's the nicest.
- Who was that?
- Nobody, just Who was that?
Was it that stuck-up bitch from last night with the fake hand?
- Whoa.
- No, it was no one, it was just beep, beep, beep.
It was-- I'm so old.
I don't even know how to use a cell phone.
- Let's go clubbing, you wanna go clubbing?
- Show me the phone.
- Let's go back to when we were having fun.
- Let me see the phone.
- Let me see your phone!
- No!
Smooth.
NlCK: I'll call you.
Nick, are you kidd-- What, do you keep the ringer on?
Amateur move, man.
Yeah, I'm just in over my head.
Schmidt, I hate asking this - how do you do this?
- Glory be.
Are you asking for my help?
- Oh, I'm-- I'm flattered.
- Pull up.
Yank back on that yoke.
We have to face the reality of the situation: Schmidt has been having consensual sex with Cece and lying about it.
He's better than us at this, Winston, I hate it as much as you do!
And, Schmidt, I hate saying this, but I might - I might respect you.
- Thank you for saying that.
You've come a long way, man.
Since my 20s, I've had a string of lesser paramours, which Iike weathered stone steps, have led me to the Hindu temple a. k.a. Cece, because she's lndian.
Let's get it started, ha You don't have to be so gentle with me.
SCHMlDT: All right.
That's how I like it, baby.
All right.
Sex, man.
It's the real stuff.
I don't know that I should help you.
You're not a player.
You're a clingy serial monogamist with Well, with a terrible metabolism.
Schmidt, I need you to teach me to be a douche bag.
- Let's get to work.
- What's happening?
- Hey, babe.
- Oh, hey, Cece.
- Doing some stretches?
- Good guess, model.
No, just limbering up in case I want to have sex with one of your roommates.
- Do you want some company?
- What?
- Want some company?
- Sorry, I can't hear you.
Diane Keaton's talking about her rich life full of loyal friends.
Oh, Jess, I hate when we fight, I get so stressed out.
I mean, my eye twitch is back.
I'm eating bread, all right?
- Just let me come on this run with you!
No!
Seriously, Jess, it was just one secret!
Everybody's got secrets!
Good afternoon.
My name is Mr. Schmidt.
M- R Not even a real chalkboard.
- First of all, Nick, congrats.
- Thank you.
You're meeting a lot of young women, and for whatever reason they find you appealing.
In the restaurant of life, you've selected the tasting menu.
- I don't want to do this anymore.
- You're terrible at lying.
So, what we want to do is, we want to focus on S.S.V. - Can't believe you slept with Cece.
- Short.
Simple.
- Vagina.
- Vague.
It's actually vague.
Let's apply it.
I'm one of these girls coming in, I wanna party - I'm in college.
- I'm in.
- Hey, what happened to your phone?
- Jesus took it.
A Jesus hawk on a speedboat.
The environment.
Bears.
Family.
Magic.
- I need your help, Schmidt.
- Yeah.
I'm the girl, the whole objective is to get me out the front door as fast as you possibly can.
- Let's do this.
Ready?
- Yeah, what's your name?
My name is Janine, all right?
God.
- Don't make that sound.
- Good morning, Nick.
You gave it to me good last night.
Gave me the full business.
Yeah.
- This is weird.
- One of the weirder things we've done.
What you thinking, brown-eyes?
Wanna grab brunch?
- Sure, Janine, that sounds fun.
- God-- No!
You don't wanna go grab brunch!
- Damn it, Nick.
Focus.
- I'm all turned around.
- I just had sex with Janine!
I have feelings!
- Yeah, so you're done!
I sleep with her then kick her out like she's a piece of meat?
- This is the problem.
- Ask me again.
- Okay, cowboy, wanna saddle up again?
- No, sweetie, I can't.
- Good, why not?
- I got things to do, I got plans.
- You have work.
Plans can be canceled.
- I'm not living in a house of lies I can't do it anymore.
Is this happening too?
- No, this is not happening.
- This isn't what it looks like.
Hey, look, fine.
From now on, we are going to be open and honest in this loft.
That means that I have secrets I wanna get off my chest.
- Rather not.
- Don't want to hear.
Schmidt, a couple months ago, I found Nick using your chenille throw as a napkin.
That is a micro-fiber blend from Pakistan, heathen.
Stop quoting the catalog like a weirdo.
Good.
This is healthy.
Air it out.
All right, one more.
Schmidt said that Winston is in danger of becoming a nanny for life.
He said you were going "full Poppins".
Winston, I can see anger in your eyes-- Schmidt thinks about you when he's making love to himself.
- What?
What?
- One time.
I thought about bangs and your face just appeared beneath them.
Okay, by the way, like I'm the only one?
Nick told me it happened to him, like, a bunch of times.
Winston, you told me you had a sex dream about Jess - and she had raccoon hands.
- Dreams do not count!
You've all thought about me while self-completing?
SCHMlDT: Yeah.
Look, Jess - Yeah.
it's not that big a deal.
Really, it's the sincerest form of flattery.
We're going back to keeping secrets.
When l walk through this door, into my room this conversation never happened.
Oh, my God!
So, what did the raccoon hands look like?
Oh, heh, heh.
Man, they were digging through garbage.
- Oh, my God!
- Do not drink my almond milk when you spent the whole night drinking Schmidt.
Jess, why are you dressed like a Mexican wrestler?
Because I don't wanna live in a world with secrets.
That means that I now know my roommates have thought about me while self-completing.
I'm wearing winter clothes until I can deal with that.
- But it's better than not knowing.
- ls it really?
- Yeah, it is.
- Jess, I don't wanna fight anymore, okay?
I said I was sorry.
We tell each other everything, I've never not told you something.
That's what second base means?
Then I'm not a virgin anymore.
Is it weird that he wants me to talk in a deep voice and call myself Kevin?
I had a dream that I killed you.
You tell me everything, all right?
I stopped telling you everything, because every time I did - you got so judgmental and critical-- - What?
I had to give it a try, Jess, I mean, that was the same hand that was inside Elmo.
Cece.
Okay, yeah.
You got me.
You don't have secrets, Jess, because you never do anything stupid.
- Look at me.
- With guys.
So living with Spencer for six years was not a mistake?
Cece, I'm not judging you.
It's just - Schmidt?
- Judging.
See what that is?
No, I'm not judging until now.
Don't look at me.
Jess, would you please?
A winter hat won't stop us thinking about you from time to time - when we delight ourselves.
- Oh, no.
Could you guys keep it down?
I have a lady visitor.
- Hi, Nick.
- Oh, I get it.
It's actually a fantasy of mine.
Could you say the following words out loud: The ice roads are too dangerous, you're gonna have to turn back, chief.
I'm not saying that.
NlCK: Okay.
I want my scarf, it is 62 degrees out and I'm freezing.
I have work-- I have plans, l-- - Get in there, come on.
- Can I just pay you for the scarf?
- Fine.
Twenty-five dollars.
- Twenty-fi-- No, I'll just help you look for it.
Nick, where'd you go?
- Are you kidding me?
- No, no, no, it's a bear a magic bear, that's all it is, just stop.
- Hey Nick, can I have this circle scarf?
- Who is this?
- My scarf.
- No.
It's my scarf!
It's mine!
It's mine!
No!
No!
Nick, I just want you to know that I am not judging you right now.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Sure.
Ladies, let's not do this.
At least not with our shirts on.
Know how many things I haven't told you?
No, I don't, because apparently I don't know you at all!
Are you running a 10K tomorrow?
Who knows?
Are you even against MS anymore?
Beats me!
They stopped hitting each other, they're hitting me!
All right, you wanna go?
This New Year's, I wasn't at my parents' house.
I was down in St. Bart's with a guy who might be an arms dealer.
And my feet aren't wider than yours, I just told you that to make you feel better.
And when we were 10 years old, I went to the movie My Girl with Jessica P. before I saw it with you!
And I own a motorcycle!
Jessica P.?
Jessica freaking P.?
- Oh, my God, are you crying under there now?
- No!
No!
- I think you are!
- No, I'm not!
All right, everybody stop!
Wherever you are right now, just sit down.
Okay, now, Saturday is a day for sleeping.
And damn it, you will not take that from me.
You, give her her scarf back.
Finders keepers is not a thing.
- You, get out of my house!
- Who are you?
Who am l?
Who am l?
Well, I am Theodore K. Mullins and Nick is my lover on the down low.
Tell her, Nick.
Tell her how it really goes down in apartment 4D.
Oh, great Negro spiritual, please come down and loose these chains on this woman.
Flesh on flesh, when the lights are off, we are all the same.
- Not true.
- Dear Lord.
Help me, Father!
Get out of my house.
Get out of my house!
I'm leaving.
- I'm out.
- Hey, can you give me a ride?
- Get out.
I'm gonna stop and get a manicure, wanna come?
- You told Harpo to beat me?
- Bye, guys.
You want them over me?
Over m-- You.
You're sweating so much it looks like rain.
And you.
You're peaking, you're at the prime of your life, that's Cece.
Get rid of the motorcycle.
Jess.
Don't act like you don't think about us when you go solo.
Okay?
I don't work a 9-to-5, I'm here all day, I can hear you.
Now go away, because I'm having cereal.
Runners, take their marks.
I don't wanna walk around with you I don't wanna walk around with you So why do you wanna walk around me?
I don't wanna walk around with you  I don't wanna walk around with you Why do all female runners look like old German women when they run?
SCHMlDT: Oh, boy, look at her glisten.
Oh, Cece.
- That sports bra's doing God's work.
- Two months.
Can't stop, I've got to beat Jess!
What are you-- ?
What is wrong with you, sir?
That is Cece's water!
You animal.
- This thing with our girls is out of control.
WlNSTON: Our girls?
It makes me sad to see them fighting over me like this.
Then why are you smiling?
Have you guys seen Cece?
- Yeah, she's way down there - hasn't even broken a sweat.
- Jess?
Okay, Jess, arms up.
Arms up, I need you long and loose like seagrass.
Moving, mov-- - Aah!
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, why?
- I'm sorry, I'm just mad at you.
My adrenaline is going.
- Did you make that?
- What?
And Cece let you wear it?
What?
She thought it was funny.
- Cece.
Cece!
Cece!
- What's that about, man?
- I think the shirt's pretty funny.
- Not funny.
- Puns freak me out, you know that.
- I like it.
WOMAN 1: Nick!
WOMAN 2: Nick!
NlCK: I hooked up with both these girls last week.
I didn't know they knew each other.
I thought they just lived in the same apartment.
Why didn't you call me?
Why didn't you tell me you hooked up with my roommate?
Willow, I didn't call you because I had a family emergency.
Is everything okay?
Yes, it is.
Megan, I didn't tell you about Willow because the moment we had was so beautiful and intense that for a second, I thought we were the only people on the planet.
Oh, okay.
- Well, we'll see you later.
- Bye.
NlCK: Bye, guys.
It worked.
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know, I'm trembling, but it worked.
That was so good, my pants just got tight, Nick.
Oh, God, now I hate me as much as I've always hated you.
- Skin.
- See, I have to do this now.
- No, you don't.
- I do.
- All you have to do is not do it.
- lt works.
Cece!
Cece!
I can't breathe.
Cece!
I know why you didn't tell me about Schmidt.
Because you like him!
- What?
- The shirt, Cece.
You thought the shirt he made was funny.
You obviously like him.
It's the only explanation for thinking that's funny.
Oh, my God, I think you're right.
You didn't wanna tell me because I would know and you weren't ready to admit it to yourself.
Can we say I didn't tell because I'm a total bitch?
I'm way more comfortable with that.
Maybe I like Schmidt.
You-- You can't tell anyone.
- Yeah.
That's, like, a secret only I know.
- Heads up.
I'm peeing.
Oh, my God.
- Okay, come on, we've got to finish.
- Oh!
No!
- Oh, come on, man.
- Come on, dude.
Don't do that.
Hey, here they come!
- Here they come, come on, guys!
WlNSTON: Let's go!
NlCK: Finish the race!
Finish strong!
WlNSTON: Come on, ladies.
NlCK: Come on, guys!
Come on, 900!
SCHMlDT: All right!
NlCK: Come on, 585.
Good job, guys.
- Finish strong!
NlCK: Winners!
- Oh, man.
- Thanks for waiting, man.
- Hey, thanks for the 10 bucks.
Guess what, you guys.
My shoes are filled with blood.
Ha, ha, ha.
I think it's time to go home, a little help, come on.
I got her, I got her.
Okay, Jess, here we go.
Okay, Schmidt, grab her feet.
- All right, there we go.
- Bring her this way.
Good job, Jess.
Real proud of you.
What are you doing?
Trying to make it confess?
Easy with the knife, Robespierre.
I will cut off your weaker fingers, Schmidt, I'll start with your pinky.
- You guys are adorable.
- We are not adorable, okay?
We're just two people having casual, successful sex.
My bad.
-  Please.
- All right.
I can't stand this heat.
I'm gonna get out of the kitchen.
- Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
- You should really stretch, Jess.
You know, Jess thinking that we're a cute couple is I don't-- It's kind of a turn-off.
How do we explain to her that this is just-- It's just sex?
Mm-hm.
What is that?
That is shoddy worksmanship, is what that is.
I'm taking you off prep - clean the beans.
- Taking my knife.
Be careful with that knife.
It's from Japan.
Why?
Why, Cece?
- Why am I sleeping with Schmidt?
- ls it a pity thing?
Is he sick?
You working for the government?
He's holding you against your will.
If he is holding you against your will, blink twice.
Blink twice.
Are you tired of being turned on?
Hm?
You have a mole fetish?
Is it huge?
Ahem.
I'm sorry, let me-- Let me rephrase that.
Is it huge?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I love these parties.
I feel like I'm an ambassador or a spy.
Or a really high-class prostitute.
It's a political fundraiser.
Who's to say you can't be all three.
Hey, this is really good.
I gotta tell you, I'm really - Happy.
- Happy.
It's like the complete opposite of my marriage.
- I'll give you opposite of your marriage.
- What?
Sorry, I just-- I've never heard you talk about your ex-wife and I got really nervous and I tried to flirt information out of you.
No.
So I haven't been home in a week and underneath my dress, I'm wearing a pair of your boxer briefs that I borrowed-slash-stole-slash "I'm not giving them back".
Come on, let's go.
Go to my house right now.
Well, I have to go to my home for a bit.
No, no, come on.
Come on, stay with me.
No, I'm worried about the guys.
They must really be missing me and wondering where I am.
WlNSTON: Hey!
Ahh!
Ahh!
- Sacrifice!
Sacrifice!
Lava.
Touch the lava.
- Touch the lava.
- Touch the lava, dude.
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess MAN : The worst quarterback in the league.
It would be better if he wasn't even playing.
Listening to the radio, writing with a pen?
What decade are we in?
I cannot listen to that guy.
Come on, Joe Napoli is the worst, man.
What?
Man, that is blasphemous.
He's the king of sports radio, man.
I've got an interview with him.
He's hiring a new research assistant.
Hence, the research.
My old basketball coach set it up.
Gotta figure out how to break it to Elvin.
You gotta cut ties with that kid.
He freaks me out.
He never blinks.
He's like a tiny little owl.
In a shirt.
Hey, guys.
- Hey.
I have so much to tell you.
I spent the whole week with rich people.
I finally tried port.
Were you gone last week?
Is that why it was so quiet?
I feel like I haven't see you guys in so long.
- You all look so handsome, grown up.
- Thank you.
Nick, I finally notice the one-eighth Cherokee.
Winston, that's almost a mustache.
Yeah.
It's creepy and thin, just like I like it.
- How was your sex-cation with Russell?
- I did have a lot of sex.
- What'd you guys do without me?
- Nothing.
- Just played True American.
- You played True American without me?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, sorry, it's Cece.
- Hey you.
Tell me everything.
How's it going?
- Where are you?
With Schmidt.
Where are you?
Right here.
Wow.
- I am not used to this yet.
- I'm surprised this one is standing.
Burned through a lot of ideas last night.
- That's great.
- We went deep into the stables.
- Yeah.
Cool.
NlCK & WlNSTON: Ugh.
I don't know, it's like we're living in a romantic comedy montage, like-- We, like, throw our heads back when we laugh and I try on floppy hats for him.
You know, it's pretty perfect.
It's like the first act of a TV movie until I find out that he has a wife and kids in another state.
Yeah, but nothing's perfect, right?
You're kind of doing everything on his terms and living in his beautiful, fancy house.
I'm not really living there.
Has he ever spent a night here?
Hey, guys.
So listen, Russell is gonna come and stay this weekend.
- Ugh.
- I was wondering if you guys could be cool.
Yeah.
NlCK: Sure.
- Yeah.
Actually, I don't trust what "cool" means to all of you so how about we just say be normal?
- Big R. What's up, man?
- Schmidt.
- Yep.
- Your shoe's untied.
Oh.
- What are you doing?
- Label check, man.
Label check.
I got it.
- Russell.
- Oh!
- Oh, man, you scared me.
- You scared of black people?
No.
- It's 2012, baby.
- I'm - Yeah, of course.
- Easy.
Quick question.
Russell is a visionary, would it be okay if I took him through my ldea Notebook?
- Nope.
- I won't take him through the whole book.
- How about none of it?
- I'm excited about one called Real Apps - I know Russell would be interested in.
No.
- Nick, Real Apps is my idea.
- Real Apps is not your idea.
You might have birthed the idea but I midwifed the crap out of it.
Guys.
- lt was a messy birth.
NlCK: You thought of the name.
SCHMlDT: The name is everything.
The name is the name of the game.
The game is the name.
Game is the name.
- The product is the game.
Guys.
I know you can do this.
- You sure you don't wanna swing?
- No.
- Pushing is where the action is.
- Heh, heh.
Elvin, listen, buddy, I think we should talk.
You know I'm not gonna be here forever, right?
I know about death, Winston.
I know there's no farm where dogs and grandpas go.
What?
No.
It's just that I'm an adult.
Time for me to get an adult job with adult people.
You understand, right?
Maybe we should get to work on your résumé because yours is terrible.
It's 2012, Winston.
Typing is not a special skill.
- And you're familiar with the show?
- Yes.
Been listening for years.
- What do you think of Mr. Napoli?
- He's actually like an idol of mine.
Be honest, jackass.
Would you consider yourself an undercover cop?
- Seriously.
Are you a cop?
Tell me.
- No.
How far can you drag an unconscious man?
- I haven't really checked-- lNTERVlEWER: Mr. Napoli.
If you're as bad an assistant as you were a point guard, I'll eat you.
I know you, Winston Bishop, okay.
Subpar collegiate career, went to Latvia.
Nine percent from the European-slash-women's 3-point line.
Now you wind up in my lap.
I'm the luckiest girl in school.
Hey, I want you to meet our new assistant, Winston Bishop.
Okay, first of all, I have not agreed to do it Welcome to the team, Winston.
Hope Joe hasn't been too tough on you.
I'm in.
I'll do it.
Um It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
- Can I sit on your shoulders?
- Sure.
- Really?
- No.
Oh.
You've made a wonderful decision.
I'm sure you're gonna learn a lot.
- Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Welcome aboard.
You can start today.
- I wanna talk to Kareem about the show.
- I wanna talk to you about jackets.
You said we were gonna get show jackets.
Russell, hey.
I can show you around.
I can show you our world.
Way up here, it's crystal clear.
- Nick, you're doing Aladdin.
- Again?
- Do you like cheeses, Russell?
- That's--  Nick, come on.
- It's for Russell.
So you really just call these ethnic noodles?
Actually, I don't know.
The English writing on the box says: "Find water, grow hot.
Family celebrate plus".
That guy.
- Nick, stop staring.
- I'm not-- What-- ?
Schmidt's being weird too.
So I told you and Jess to go get some sushi at Asakune but I hear you hari-kari'd that one.
- Well, I know the chef at Namuda.
- Oh, oh, Namuda?
Maybe, "My first sushi".
Baby wants a tempura California roll.
- Little Russell wants an avocado roll.
Schmidt.
Nick, don't eat his noodles.
- But we're bowl brothers now.
No, you're not.
- Tighten up, guys.
WlNSTON: I'll kill him.
I wanna punch him in his rich, old, white-dude face.
Not you.
Joe Napoli.
So I guess you didn't get the job?
No, I got the job.
And that's the problem.
I want six shakes in my fridge at all times, ready to go.
And I want it Beyoncé colored.
Not darker, not lighter.
Beyoncé!
Clean your damn desk.
Don't let him see you cry.
I wanna kill him.
Russ, I was wondering if later if you wouldn't mind taking a look at my ldea Notebook.
- Um Hold that thought.
NlCK: I will.
Because he doesn't wanna hear it.
- Those ideas are 51 percent mine.
Okay?
- Oh!
- I got it.
Russell, move.
- What'd I do?
NlCK: You did nothing.
Don't blame yourself.
It just fights back a little bit, Russ.
Anchor me, anchor me!
Anchor me, come on.
- Anchor, don't grope!
SCHMlDT: Jess, get in there!
- Pan!
NlCK: Jess!
Oh, my God.
Sorry.
You guys, my contractor knows a really great plumber-- - I know the best plumbers.
- White guy knows a plumber.
Sorry.
Plumbing is a really sensitive topic here.
- I didn't know.
- Who would?
Um Hey.
Who wants to play True American?
- I'm in.
That's sounds like a great idea.
NlCK: Yeah.
So it's 50 percent drinking game, Well, it's more like 75 drinking, The floor is molten lava.
It's actually 90 percent drinking and it's got a loose Candy Land-like structure.
With stakes.
SCHMlDT: Guys, we doing teams?
- Yeah.
Call it out, Schmitty.
SCMlDT: Ready?
One, two, three, go.
NlCK: Two, two, four.
- I'm with Russell.
Perfect.
- Don't wanna be on my team?
I copied you.
You haven't given me any information.
So it starts off, there are four zones.
An alternate zone is a crazy zone.
There's a trail of chairs, but the floor is lava.
These are the pawns, soldiers of the secret order.
This is the king of the castle.
Everything you hear in True American is a lie.
Knock on wood.
- Starts with a shotgun tip-off.
- Yeah.
Oh, that I can do.
- Shotgun.
Sure.
SCHMlDT: Yes!
WlNSTON: All right.
Yeah.
NlCK: Yes.
Yeah.
There's no going back now.
One, two, three, four, JFK.
SCHMlDT: Go, go, go!
- Russell, you're in the lava.
NlCK: Yo, that's my spot.
- I don't understand.
Lincoln, Washington.
NlCK & SCHMlDT: Cherry tree.
All right, American, you ready?
Let's do the count.
One, two, three.
- That's me!
Yeah!
NlCK: Russell!
- Okay, remember, the ground is lava.
NlCK : Russell!
Russell!
- Russell!
SCHMlDT: Don't touch the lava.
- Yeah!
SCHMlDT: All right!
- All right, the big R!
- Yes!
The only thing we have to fear--  Is fear itself!
SCHMlDT: Drink!
- Yeah!
- Drink.
All trash belongs:  In the junkyard!
Jimmy Carter on top.
Grover Cleveland.
- What now?
- More beer.
More beer.
I gotta get to the castle!
- Go, Nick, go.
- Russell, you're kind of ripped up.
I used to work summers in a lumber camp near Banff.
I still split my own wood.
NlCK: JFK!
FDR!
You're pretty good at this, oldtimer.
Oh, oh!
Cece.
This is the best game of True American ever.
- I'm this close to winning.
- I'm gonna go get in your bed.
Damn.
- Yeah, I'm out.
NlCK: Schmidt, no!
- No!
SCHMlDT: Wait.
- Does it mean we win?
- It's unofficial.
Yes, we win.
- Whoo!
U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!
- Oh, give it.
- We had you.
This is True American!
I'm trashed.
I am in a trash bag right now.
It's true.
- We should call it a night.
- No, hang on.
- I was saying something-- - Let me tell what you were saying.
- I remember-- - Guys, I'm really sorry.
I'm on a water break.
It's over here.
He wants his water.
You were giving me advice on my boss because you are also a rich white man.
And that's okay.
Hell, yeah, I am.
Hey, I love you.
We have a big day planned tomorrow, maybe-- This is-- Hang on sec.
Let me straighten you out.
Here's what you do.
Your boss is power-playing you.
So you need to power-play him back.
- Classic.
- How do I do that?
Dip your boys in his shake.
- What?
That's what you gotta do.
Your testicles, dip them in, wring them out, dip it again, and give him the shake.
- That's a terrible idea.
- Jess, no, no.
Hang on.
A guy thing.
Territory.
You don't know.
Guy thing.
Jess doesn't get it.
Territory thing.
- Stop copying Russell.
- I'm not.
Classic is a classic.
Just get in there, dunk your nuggets in his shake.
- That's what I'm talking about.
- We've learned a lot.
Know what would make this night really great?
- Sleep.
- ldea Notebook.
- Yeah.
- Have you ever wanted to take a ride - on a magic idea?
Well, strap on--  Russell - Iet's go to sleep.
- No, I'll be in in a second.
I wanna hear your idea.
What-- ?
Take one more of these and this idea is gonna be better.
Okay.
NlCK: Down the hatch.
Okay, let's have a little bit more of that.
I'm mad at him.
And I've never been mad at him before.
Ugh.
Jess, this room is not a place of comforting, okay?
This is Darwin's jungle.
Where open-minded people do weird things to each other.
Go away.
- Yeah.
- I can't fight with him.
That's our thing, we don't fight.
He used to fight with his ex-wife.
I think he likes that we're peaceful.
Fighting is good, it's healthy.
It's how you know it's working.
You know, Jess, what Cece and I like to do is we like to fight with our bodies.
It's like a really intense game of capture the flag.
I won't make you guess what the flag is.
As my business partner, I appreciate you taking the time.
Russell said we need a prototype.
So, Mr. Schmidt, I now present you Real Apps.
The phone goes here where the phone goes.
And then these are all the apps.
You've got a Zippo, you've got a fork, got a spoon.
That's a corn holder.
Also a gentleman's shiv.
It's a prototype of a prototype at best.
- Let me see it.
- Don't be mean about it.
- You got a bottle opener.
- Come on.
Look at this.
There's no brush steel, no nickel.
It's got none of the baller metals.
I mean, come on, man.
I'm not gonna Winklevossed because of your sloppiness.
What do you mean "l"?
Real Apps is my idea.
You came up with the name.
Yeah, and the name is the game, friend-o.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Would you line up around the corner if they called the iPhone a slippery germ brick.
- I might.
- That's why they call it basketball - not peach-basket catch-it-up.
- You just came up with that?
Hey, hey, we're back here on the Joe Napoli Show.
Wanna introduce a new member of the show family.
And that is Winston Bishop, who is our new assistant.
He's sharp as a tack.
Ladies, there's no ring on his finger.
Tell us just a little about yourself.
Thanks.
I really wanna tell you about myself.
I've been on the job two days, I don't know how to make no milkshake.
I played two years of mediocre Division I basketball.
Why?
I didn't know basketball.
I got recruited for a girls' volleyball team.
There he is.
That's Winston Bishop.
We'll see you again probably never.
Turning now to the NBA picture, it looks like the west-- Hangover eggs.
They'll stop you from throwing up the rest of the day or you'll throw up really fast.
High risk, high reward.
Maybe I should just go back to bed?
I have a nice day planned for us.
We're gonna go apple picking.
I don't pick apples.
I-- That's not gonna happen.
- Are you serious?
- Because it's picking and it's apple.
- You're serious.
- Literally sounds like hell.
Okay.
- We in a fight?
- We're not fighting.
- This feels like a fight, Jess.
- This is not a fight!
Russell, my man, seems these days, there's an app for everything.
- Doesn't it, though?
- Yeah, but there isn't.
Let's say I'm and about, you know, being mobile and I wanna cut a bagel, cobble a shoe.
- Haberdash on the fly.
- ls there an app for that?
- No.
SCHMlDT: Is there?
- Until now.
- That's right.
NlCK: We now present to you - Real Apps.
- Real Apps.
The prototype.
- Relapse?
- Real Apps.
Real Apps.
Relapse?
- Relapse?
- Would you calm-- ?
- You called my baby Relapse?
- I didn't-- - I gave you 51 percent for Relapse?
- Russell.
Enough.
Russell, hold it in your hands, my man.
We're in the middle of something, guys.
No.
We're fine.
Show it to him, Schmidt.
- Have to-- - I wanna-- - Here, Russell.
- Wrong way.
Do it like that.
- Oh, no, no.
Oh, my God.
- You okay?
- I've been stabbed.
Oh, my God.
SCHMlDT: It wasn't ready.
- You called it Relapse.
- Where are the Band-Aids?
- No Band-Aids.
- What?
I'll get you a takeout napkin - and some Scotch Tape.
- Searing pain!
- I'm so sorry.
Here.
Ow, ow, ow!
You just taped a napkin to my hand.
I'm gonna go.
I need to be home.
Is that a problem?
No.
I'm fine.
It's great.
We're great.
Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
- Nick did it.
- Let it all out.
- I have an idea for your idea book.
- Replace the Band-Aids!
- Very fair.
- It's all sticky.
- I have an app for that.
ELVlN: What are you doing here?
Why aren't you at your new job?
I'm quitting.
You're quitting your dream job?
Well, I mean, there's good news.
I wanna keep being your nanny.
That's what I come to tell you mom.
I can't let you do that.
Mom, Mom!
Winston just asked me if he can smoke weed.
- What?
- What?
WlNSTON: No.
- Said when we go to the park he wanted to do it.
I get to hold it - because I'm a minor.
- Where is your imagination taking you?
- You said that in front of my kid?
- Gina.
You serious?
Are you completely insane?
Gina, you know me.
I'm wearing a tie and everything.
You're never, ever, gonna nanny again.
I will destroy you on the nanny boards.
- Count on that.
Come on, Elvin.
- Let me explain.
Elvin, Elvin, Elvin.
Hey now.
Elvin, let's get away.
Get away from the hippie.
Come on.
Bye, Winston.
- Bye, Elvin.
GlNA: No, no.
Don't talk to him.
It's 4:20, don't you have to be somewhere?
Oh, no.
The shakes.
Si-- Where are you number six?
Hey, Bishop.
I thought you left early.
Assumed you weren't coming back.
Something is wrong with the shakes.
I went ahead and just threw them out.
There's something wrong with them.
I should go and throw that one out.
What did you do to the shakes?
- They've been compromised.
- What did you do?
Look, I really, really want this job, Mr. Napoli.
I know you're gonna fire me if I tell you but I'd love a future here and I don't want that to be jeopardized by a moment of poor judgment.
I put my beans in your shakes.
Yeah.
And I shook it around a little bit like this: In there?
You stuck them down in there, huh?
I did.
Oh, man.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna do that to Kareem.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I have something to say to you.
- Don't apologize.
I'm not here to apologize.
I'm here to fight.
- I don't care if you wanna fight or not.
- Let's fight.
I was prepared to have a nice weekend and you just give up and come home.
I was bleeding from my hand.
I had to go to the ER.
I had to get a stitch.
Ohh.
Stitches.
"I'm too fancy for a Band-Aid".
I'm actually really sorry about that.
I haven't played a drinking game in 10 years.
I did it because you asked me to.
If I wanna have a drink, I don't have to play a game while doing it.
That's my world.
Garbage disposals don't work - elevators don't pass inspection.
- I didn't know.
Yeah.
It was like the cables were really thin.
We signed a waiver.
- Took a hundred bucks off our rent.
- Not safe.
That's where I live, and those are my friends.
And that wasn't even the first stabbing this month.
And Russell, my life is just as important as your life.
And if you wanna get with me, you have to get with my friends.
That is a Spice Girls song.
We just had a fight.
- I won.
- You did not win.
Hey, let's just go back to your loft and try again.
Let's just hang out.
Oh.
Now?
I mean, I just got here.
Maybe later.
Okay.
That sounds like a plan.
Those boxers you borrowed, I'm gonna need them back.
- They're my lucky underpants.
- Lucky underpants?
And what are the values of the Olympic games?
Openness, exchange.
The first victims of an authoritarian security regime.
I'm Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and that's "The View from Up Here".
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
But you're using birth control, right?
Yeah.
Of course.
It's just that Schmidt gets so athletic, that birth control becomes Iike one of those plastic barbecue covers in a hurricane.
I didn't wanna know that.
Okay.
The pregnancy test doesn't work until after six days.
So just get through the weekend.
And don't tell Schmidt until you're sure.
Yeah, no.
Of course not.
Of course.
It's just I can't stop thinking about what a Schmidt baby would be like.
Just I mean I don't know.
Would it just wanna nurse Probably.
- We could make it, like, a douche baby jar.
- Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, my God.
Ladies.
Ladies, what is all the screaming about?
Oh, my-- Jess, have you finally agreed to be our third?
Because we've discussed this.
- We have never talked about that.
- What?
This is not the time.
We were thinking what you might have been like as a baby.
Oh.
I was the bomb-diggity as a baby.
I mean, I was, like, breakdancing at 8 months old.
They say I needed a Magnum size diaper.
Oh, my God.
- Get out.
Seriously.
JESS : Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess What's with the suit?
If you say swing dancing, I'm gonna slap your face.
My boss is gonna be on TV today.
Michael Strahan's new talk show.
On the Strahan Narrow.
- Great show.
- Got too many DUls to drive himself.
- I gotta take him.
Stay out of my room.
Cece is resting.
Hey, guys.
Listen up.
Sarah's gonna be here in a few, so best behavior.
- Who's Sarah?
- Russell's daughter.
So no F-bombs, P-bombs.
Actually, no B- through S-bombs.
No bombs.
No bringing home college girls, Berlusconi.
- Ha, ha.
- Hey, that's not fair.
The girl I've been hanging out with is totally mature and interesting.
Please put on pants.
Everything you say sounds creepy when not wearing pants.
- Your hair looks nice.
WlNSTON: Ugh!
- Mmm.
This coffee is smoldering.
So creepy.
- What's with the babysitter?
- He's seeing if I can be a mom.
- You nervous?
- Nothing I can't handle.
I'm her teacher.
So  Oh, she's here.
Nick, put on some pants.
- Or at least some really high socks.
- High socks it is.
- Hi, Miss Day.
- Hi, Sarah.
I can be here in under five minutes if I need to be.
Honestly, I wouldn't have agreed to this except my husband's out of town and you're Sarah's favorite teacher and my husband's favorite teacher.
Hey, I hope this doesn't sound rude, but, um You keep saying "husband" and I just wanna make sure you and Russell - you're not still married.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, no.
I just wanted to make sure there wasn't important information - that I totally missed.
Okay.
- No.
But he'll always be my husband, if you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Actually, could you explain what you mean very clearly?
Cece's acting really weird.
Do you think she's getting tired of me?
I mean, look, it's been like months of nonstop sex.
What can I do if she doesn't let me hit fifth chakra?
- I'm not listening to this.
- I'm just saying-- Do you think she wants something more than sex?
Do you think she's finally becoming a girl?
I can't handle that.
- Hey, boss.
Hm?
- What are you doing?
Look.
- Wait, yesterday you said noon.
- You think I've become too dependent on the hot-lava massage?
- I'm gonna be there in just a second.
- Costumes.
I made her dressed up too much?
I'm not gonna sit here and bond with you about this.
I gotta go babysit my boss.
You gonna stay?
We're gonna borrow your pasta maker.
Oh, that's great.
You gonna teach Sarah your recipe for overcooked mush?
Ha, ha.
No, I'm teaching her about ltaly.
- I'm coming with a date.
Chloe.
You are not bringing those girls around Sarah.
Hey, you must be Sarah.
And you guys are wrong about Chloe.
Chloe is smart and she's mature and she knows about art and famous artists like Banksy and the guy who did the Obama poster and, you know, like, Chalk Outline Guy.
That's stupid.
Heh, heh.
Your eyes are so brown.
They look like poop.
Be honest.
Do my eyes look like poo?
- There's a bit of a poopy-ish hue.
- Old poo eyes.
WlNSTON: Oh, hey.
- I like your house.
- Not my house.
Go!
Go!
- What's going on?
- I'm sweating spicy ban hoaw and wearing a woman's shoes.
- What you think is going on?
- Trying to give you an opportunity to lie.
Trying to be polite.
Actually, the ancient Egyptians made pasta by flattening the dough with their feet.
Cool, huh?
Sarah?
Hey.
Why do you have so many bras?
You're a teacher.
Teachers need bras too.
You know, like, a lot of erasing and stuff.
It's like: That's an after-school bra.
Can I get out of homework because you're dating my dad?
No.
Hey, Sarah, I know having your teacher dating your dad is weird.
But I just want you to know that you can ask me anything.
- Really?
- Yeah, anything.
- Are you in love with my dad?
- Mmm Do you and my dad ever dry lump?
Uh - ls sexting cool?
- What?
No.
It's not cool.
Have you done a 99?
I think that's a tax form.
- You ever given anyone plow chops?
- I don't know.
How do you make love to a person animal style?
Do you wanna learn how to play bridge?
I've been doing some thinking and I think it's time that I take you on a real date.
- You're asking me out on a date?
- lt'll be our first real date.
Italy on Ice is a celebration of all things ltalian.
Featuring ice dancing's biggest and brightest ltalian stars.
Drea de Matteo is scheduled to appear, but they're not liable if she doesn't.
I can't go right now.
It's a really bad time, okay?
I'm sorry.
Just Take someone else.
- You mean, like, another girl?
- Yeah, Schmidt.
That's what this is.
That's the deal.
- Just take someone else, okay?
- All right, sure.
I'll just-- I'll ask somebody else.
I'll just-- Yeah.
Totally.
With these VlP tickets I got  What?
It's popcorn in ltalian.
I don't think you should be rushing into these things.
- You need to look for a partner who-- - Ew.
- You said "partner".
- I know.
That sucked.
I'm sorry.
Look, as your friend, Jess-- Not Miss Day.
-- just choose someone who makes you laugh.
Like Nick?
Yeah.
Wait, what?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I love Nick so, so, so much.
- He's so hot.
- That Nick?
I wanna rub my face on his face.
Just to be clear.
I am dialing another woman to go see Italy on Ice right now.
That's fine.
Do it.
- Hey, guys.
Not now.
- Oh, it's ringing.
- Don't care.
- This room cannot take more hormones.
Unh.
Unh.
I love the juxtaposition of the hi-brow literary with low-brow youth culture.
It's almost too much juxtaposition for me, you know what I mean?
It's right up to the line of juxtaposition, but I think I'm gonna let it slide.
Hey, I gotta-- Yes.
- You've got Nick.
- Hey, Nicole.
- What's going on?
- What it be, girl?
What you got going on, ma?
It's the freaking weekend.
- Did you just call me a "girl"?
- Are you wearing something sexy?
- Button-down and jeans like always.
- You got jeans on, baby?
Are they tight?
- They're a little loose.
I buy them big.
- Them jeans sound sexy.
- Everything all right?
Hang out more?
- You taking care of that tushy for me?
I'm not doing, like, squats or anything?
- I'm trying to eat less doughnuts.
- You still keeping it tight?
You're an idiot.
What?
I thought this is what you wanted.
This is a really good example of people who should not be making love.
- Cece, are you okay?
SCHMlDT: Damn it.
You don't understand.
I love Nick so, so, so much.
He's so hot, I'm gonna die.
Sarah, Nick is way too old for you.
I live with him.
He is dirty and weird.
No, no, no.
- Sarah.
Not Nick's room.
It's not well ventilated in there.
Let's see.
We get there a little early, maybe get you in the shower.
Maybe a once-over with some disinfectant.
Hey.
Yard sale.
Pull over.
- No.
- Somebody rich died.
I can smell it.
Joe, I'm trying to get you to the show on time.
- Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
- I'm getting out of the car.
Yeah, baby.
Yard sale.
Yeah.
Oh, I feel so alive.
Ah!
I got a charley horse.
Oh, God.
Hey, Sarah?
- Can you come out of Nick's room?
I'm going to roll in his dirty clothes.
- Schmidt asked me out.
- Oh.
- He came over and asked me out.
He never asks me out.
I can't go on a date with him.
- Sarah!
Shh!
- I've had enough of this.
Listen to me!
Listen to me.
All right, you little brat!
You just need to be quiet because I need my friend to focus on me right now!
What are you doing?
You know how much this means to me.
Don't let your dysfunction rub off on her.
- I am gonna be a terrible mother.
- Oh, no, no.
- A terrible mother!
- Shh.
- I'm gonna be like my mother.
- Gonna be a fashionable mom.
Gonna make this right, okay?
Just Sarah?
Hey, Sarah?
Look, you should definitely not be having sex right now at this age.
But when you do, just make sure you always use protection because even if he says it's tantric and you're lndian and you know better you're just gonna end up pregnant anyways.
SCHMlDT: What?
- Cece, are you pregnant?
Whoa.
Sarah, Nick has one tie.
See if you can find it.
No.
Okay?
I don't know.
We have to wait for the test results, but I'm late.
Oh, my We made a caramel miracle.
Ha, ha.
You pregnant.
You pregnant.
Ha, ha.
Oh, my God.
You got Cece pregnant?
- We used protection.
- Think she did it on purpose?
An lndian-Jewish baby?
Who wouldn't want that bone structure?
Okay, I'm not ready to be a godparent.
Don't ask.
- No one's asking you.
- Good.
I'm not ready to be an uncle.
- You're not my brother.
- Are you sure you're okay about this?
Because I'm freaking out that you're not freaking out.
I am oddly calm about the whole thing.
Look, Nick.
Maybe this isn't exactly in my five-year plan, but maybe this is fate.
You know, maybe I hit the jackpot.
Maybe this is the universe telling me I'm never gonna find a better girl.
- By the way, I'm Schmidt.
- Chloe.
Mazel tov on your news.
Oh, my God.
Finally, Nicholas.
- You bring home a nice girl.
- Right?
So that was crazy what happened with my friends, right?
I liked it.
Your life is like Gossip Girl, only everyone is old and poor.
You know, there actually was a show like that.
It was called Golden Girls.
I'm Betty White, Schmidt is Rue McClanahan-- - Don't you think Nick is hot?
- Nick?
Um Yeah, in a rumpled, small-town Pl kind of way.
What's he like in the morning?
Do his eyes get sleepy?
Does he love stuff?
I wanna love what he loves.
Do you think that we'll ever do animal style?
Four minutes.
We eat in four.
I made you a mocktail.
- Cece, are you crying?
- No.
No.
I just-- I don't know.
You are an amazing woman.
And you're going to do and be so many things in this life.
Maybe you'll be a mom, and maybe-- Maybe not.
But I will support you no matter what.
- Thank you.
- I also wanna give you a quick heads-up.
I'm gonna be going on the lnternet before we have sex again because I just don't want to impregnate the baby.
You know?
We could have a Russian nesting-doll situation on our hands.
So Sarah and I learned to use the pasta maker today, which was cool.
- Are you and Nick making love?
NlCK: Hm?
- Who wants seconds?
- Yeah, I'd love seconds, Jess.
If you're a boy, I'm gonna name you Mordechai.
Or Abraham.
Menahmenendo.
Schmiersen.
Hey.
I'm watching you.
- Well, time for dessert.
- Oh, don't get up.
I will take care of it.
Oh, thank you.
That's so thoughtful.
See?
Thoughtful and mature.
In your face.
Yes!
Congratulations.
You're dating a girl with basic table manners.
You win.
Why don't you get on her health-care plan?
I'm so excited to take this journey with you.
I mean, your boobs are gonna be unbelievably enormous.
Sarah, do you wanna go help Chloe with the dessert?
- I hate her.
- You don't know her well enough to hate her.
Yes, I do.
I know her.
- She used to ride on my school bus.
NlCK: No-- - Wait, what?
- Oh, my God.
That's why you look familiar.
You were the crazy little kindergartner who had the imaginary friend.
Oh, you're that skank with the skank face.
I know you're trying to look cool in front of you-know-who.
- You told him?
No.
- You told him!
- I did not tell him.
Oh, my God, Jess.
What are you saying?
When was the last time you were on a school bus?
- Last year.
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.
NlCK: Ugh  Hey, you know what, Chloe?
I think I subbed for your English class.
- That's right.
Hi, Miss Day.
Hi.
- Good thing I got you an extra shirt-- - Screw this.
Whoa, Joe, Joe.
Where you going?
Where you going?
Where are you going?
Look, I'm sorry about this, man.
Don't make me chase you.
Do not make me chase you.
Joe, come back!
Unh!
You okay?
Leave me alone.
So come on, man, what's up?
Michael Strahan makes me feel like an idiot, okay?
I mean He thinks he's better than me.
He wins the Super Bowl and suddenly he's the best.
What's he better than you at, huh?
Marriage, probably.
Money management, I would say.
He's better at that.
He's not better at yard sales.
- He's good at yard sales.
- He's not better.
You're gonna walk into that studio and show him the Napoli that I saw today.
The one that I saw grabbed seven copies of Speed on VHS at a yard sale for a fraction of the retail price.
- When is the last time Strahan did that?
- Heh, heh.
- Boom.
You're not gonna let him win.
- I'm gonna do it.
WlNSTON: You gonna do it?
- That guy's a B-hole!
You know what?
If you were a woman, man, we'd be unstoppable.
Mmm.
Eighteen years old.
She was 18 years old.
She doesn't even know what Netscape is.
She thinks of lce Cube as mainly an actor.
This is a disaster.
Ouli's downstairs.
She called me.
She wants to be let up.
Sarah's in my room, because she fell in love with you for some reason.
Might as well call you Bridge to Terabithia.
You make children cry.
I might as well call you lndian in the Cupboard because you put an lndian in-- Never mind.
- I will not apologize.
- Why are young girls in love with me?
Shut up!
Both of you!
We're gonna fix this because I'm not losing Russell because you two have to make and/or date babies.
You, go stall Ouli.
Try not to get her pregnant.
You, come with me and get Sarah out of my room.
Now.
- I'm gonna go do Ouli.
Yeah.
All right.
- I'm gonna do this.
Ouli?
Oh, my God.
It's Schmidt.
How are you?
Oh, my God.
It's so good to see you.
- Great.
- Yeah.
Havasu?
'99?
I was on the boat.
- Remember?
We were just-- Yeah.
- No.
Winter Olympics.
Uh-huh.
-2006.
Bobsled.
- No.
Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now but I promise you, you're gonna find someone better.
No.
No, I never will!
I can be an anchor.
I've been known to drag women down.
- That is true.
Save me.
- Why?
This is so entertaining.
- Okay, honestly, help me.
- I don't know what to do.
- Okay.
Just tell her something about life.
Hey, Sarah.
Sarah, I haven't loved somebody the way you love me in a very long time.
And I miss that feeling.
The feeling you have is good.
It's just misplaced.
It's better than being numb your whole life.
You end up doing weird things.
You know what?
Just stay in there.
It's not that great out here.
- Stay in there as long as you can.
- He's kidding, Sarah.
You should definitely, definitely come out.
- Oh, my God.
The Melman funeral?
- No.
We were both sitting next to Uncle Jack.
- Yeah?
Sure.
- I don't know Uncle Jack.
I used to do your hair in Tribeca.
- Sarah?
- Sarah, please.
Sarah, please come out.
I can't come out.
I'm too embarrassed.
In front of us?
We are literally the most embarrassing people on the planet.
Yeah, you don't have to be embarrassed around us.
Sometimes they talk louder to blind people.
I'm 30 years old and I've peed in every pool I've been into.
- Every single one.
- Ew.
I originally grew these bangs because I hate my forehead.
I think it's funny when a guy puts balls under his shirt and pretends it's boobs.
- They look like little boobs.
- I know.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come on, Sarah.
Look, I do so many stupid things.
You don't even know.
I mean, like falling for your dad, that was so crazy, and l I understand why you're confused.
I'm confused.
I'm not confused.
I'm stuck.
What?
- Oh, my God.
- I don't know how to get them off.
- You're okay.
I'll get the front.
- I'll get the back.
Hey, guys.
She's coming.
Ouli's coming.
I failed.
I failed.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Ouli.
Who is the man taking the bras off my daughter?
There is a God!
I got my period!
It's so amazing.
Oh, my God.
I got my period.
Ha, ha, ha.
- She got her period.
So happy!
Welcome.
Would you like a drink?
You have a beautiful daughter.
And a beautiful ex-husband.
I mean - Bye, Nick.
I'm kind of over you now.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
I had a really great time.
Thanks, Sarah.
Goodbye.
Your mom doesn't have to know everything.
- Heard that.
Let's go.
JESS : Okay.
- Thanks for coming by.
- Oh, sure.
Bye, Sarah.
See you at school.
- Bye, Ouli.
You rule-y.
OULl: Bye, Jess.
You're a mess.
I'm not having kids till I'm 80.
Now we can just go back to the way things were.
You can go on your date.
Right.
With Nicole.
Mm-hm.
No more stupid mistakes, right?
- Right.
- Heh, heh.
- I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
- Go.
Oh, wait.
Oh, God.
Okay, Cece.
There's a marathon downtown.
- I don't want you to hit traffic.
- Okay.
- That's very thoughtful.
- Head down.
Okay.
All right.
You in?
You in?
Okay.
Terrible car for a baby anyway.
Oh.
I never knew ltaly was so much more than pizza.
It's so much more.
She's okay.
You're awesome!
The reenactment of Pompeii really stays with you.
What a move!
Two shows a day.
Two shows a day.
How do they do it?
If you're gonna play a gondolier, you better skate like a gondolier.
You know what, Schmidt?
Business idea.
We should buy skaters.
Yeah!
Do something weird, Mussolini.
We love you.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thank you, guys, for joining me on this momentous day.
As you know, it's been a rough year for me.
I got dumped by Caroline, then Julia.
I opened myself up to love.
I was hurt badly, and I closed myself up again.
Downstairs neighbor put a password on their Wi-Fi.
Off topic.
- Okay, I agree.
So I've decided to give up on women and put all that energy into tomatoes.
- On us for thinking this wasn't stupid.
NlCK: Growing tomatoes.
- I thought he was trying to sell.
- I have a speech.
Wait, wait, you guys.
I told him not to lead with tomatoes, but he did.
As his friends, don't you wanna know why he wants to plant tomatoes?
- ls it because he wants tomatoes?
- This is my attempt at a new beginning.
He's sowing the seeds for a fruitful tomorrow.
- He's turning over a new leaf.
- Don't do metaphors.
- I'll trim it back.
- You did it again.
- It's just ripe with plant-- - But stop.
Looking at you, I'm realizing there's possibility of happiness.
- He's looking for a dapple of sunlight.
- Go.
- Sorry.
NlCK: Winston and Shelby.
You guys have found love, so-- - Oh, you have no idea.
- I do.
You talk about it all the time.
- We have a good idea.
- Clear idea.
Schmidt, Cece, you almost made a baby.
You almost made a person.
Think about that.
Jess.
You're dating a man that I can see myself growing old with.
You got a great-looking face.
Your jawline could cut glass.
Hold on tight.
Don't let that slip away.
- Getting a little weird, Nick.
NlCK: Without further ado water, the source of life.
Oh.
- Okay.
- All right.
Okay, I got to-- You know what?
Go downstairs if you want.
I don't care.
I got two tomatoes and I'm betting on me!
Freeze frame!
When I'm up in the air and the legs are there.
-  Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
It's Jess Cece, the Jewish is here to make sex!
Uh, it's actually Schmidt.
Um, we've met, uh, many times.
Right.
I hear you make sex through Cece wall.
You sound like dog being stepped on:  Noises I make, they come from a truthful place.
- I create a free environment in the sack.
- Hey.
What's going on here?
I like his face.
I want punch, punch, punch!
Beautiful women.
You guys can say just about anything, can't you?
- What are you doing here?
- So look, we've barely spoken since I almost, uh, impregnated you, heh.
It's this whole thing, it just kind of got me thinking.
Maybe this is just too intense and we should stop.
That's what you want?
- It's how I feel right now.
- Oh.
Coolio.
So he goes out with me.
- Oh, Nadia, I think-- - I think that's a great idea.
I mean, that's what you want, right?
Yeah, it's great.
Totally cool with me.
NADlA: Yay, we have fun.
I make him put on black shawl, pretend he's Grandma.
SCHMlDT: Fine.
Twist my arm.
I'll go out with a hot Russian model whose ancestors probably burned down my ancestors' village.
Something weird happened to me.
I was at Russell's gym and I ran into his ex-wife, Ouli.
- Jess?
Hi.
- Ouli.
- Oh, that's a great swimsuit.
- Hey, you.
Wow, someone's been working out.
Your back's like a bag of ropes.
Oh, mama.
It was really foggy and I kept making eye contact with her nipples.
Then I panicked, and invited her to dinner with Russell and me tonight.
- What?
- It's just Ouli is this looming presence.
We don't talk about it.
- I thought it would be, like, good for us.
- Everything okay with Russell?
Everything's fine.
It's gonna be tense.
Ouli's not Russell's favorite person.
But I grew up with divorced parents and I'm really good at navigating these situations.
What did I do?
Nothing.
Mommy's all right Daddy's all right They just seem a little weird Surrender, surrender Don't tap dance at dinner.
Do you think I would tap dance at dinner?
- Yes.
I'm hiding your tap shoes.
- Absolutely.
Don't do it.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi.
- Sorry I'm late.
Hi.
Hey, remember the last time we were hugging?
- Heh.
- You were naked.
It was weird.
No!
That was not weird at all.
I have no problem being naked, heh.
- Hi.
- Hi.
How are the quesadillas?
- Know what?
I've actually never had-- - Oh, the eye roll.
- Mm.
I've missed that.
I didn't roll my eyes.
I just needed to quickly stare at the ceiling.
Hey, Ouli - Mm.
- I love your name.
Thank you.
Or should I say gracias.
Uh Oh.
- Well, this is fun.
- Yeah.
Mm, it is.
So we've got, like, eight more of these, right?
- I love this song.
- Oh, I hate this song.
When we were on vacation in Oaxaca Ouli hummed this song for an eight-hour drive.
Wouldn't have been if you hadn't gotten lost.
At one point we were just following some donkeys.
- Oh, my gosh, look, it's food.
I love food.
- They were not donkeys.
Can't remember what we were talking about.
It wasn't a road.
Just because a road's not on a map - doesn't mean it's not a road!
- lnside voice.
Know what means it's not a road?
Guys telling you to turn around!
Come on, those were kids in a jeep!
Car get stuck in the mud, you could not move it.
- Oh, here it is.
- God forbid you break a nail-- I got one manicure, one time!
I'm not doing this!
I'm not doing this!
JESS : Ouli's all right Russell's all right They just seem a little weird Surrender Surrender - I'm leaving.
- Before you get your quesadillas?
That's it.
It was crazy.
There was, like, serious heat between them.
- Does she still have feelings for him?
Maybe.
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Ahem, what up?
So Nadia's excited for your date tonight.
- I bet.
- Make sure, uh, you use protection.
She's a foreigner, Cece.
Do I look like an idiot?
Seriously, she doesn't even know where she's been, all right?
What, are we at Santa's family reunion?
Because the clawses are coming out.
The claws are coming out.
You know: You're being catty, Cece.
Are you gonna let him go out with Nadia?
She was kicked out of Russia, Cece.
Russia.
Why don't you just tell him you like him?
Doesn't matter if I like him.
- It's over.
- And you're fine with that?
- Yeah.
- Are you?
Yeah, heh.
Are you?
- Yeah.
- Hold up.
Are you?
- I am gonna kill you.
- But are you?
Hey, Nick.
- What?
- You seen Shelby's cat, Rummikub?
I mean, he is the cutest.
Just the absolute cutest.
Hey, take a look at this picture when he woke up on my face.
Can't even see my face.
I look like a cat man.
No!
No, get out of here, birds!
Please, get out of here, you sky rats!
Go back to hell where you belong!
Leave me and my plants alone!
I need this!
- You know who loves birds?
- Please don't say it, Winston.
Shelby.
So How do you like America?
I like salad bar.

Mick Mouse: - What is a Mick Mouse?

Well, fancy meeting you here.
- Uh, hi.
- What's up?
- Love your gym.
- Ha, ha.
- You and Russell, huh?
Last night.
- Oh, God.
Sorry, we made you feel uncomfortable.
We can't be in the same room without wanting to rip each other's faces off.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, as long as it's, like, you know, faces, and not, like, clothes.
- You don't think-- ?
- No.
I'm just-- It's my endorphins because I'm just so high on endorphins.
Yeah.
Because there's not a chance in hell.
I mean, he is all yours.
All yours.
- Awesome.
- You know what it's like with Russell.
- Yeah.
I mean-- - Yeah.
He's a roller-coaster.
It's like standing on the bow of a catamaran blasted with spray during a perfect storm  but you're naked, and And you're on fire, heh.
- You know?
Ah.
- Yeah.
I do.
I'm just like, "Russell, put away the passion Unh.
and show me a moderately good time".
- Yup.
- Crazy.
- So crazy.
- Hmm.
So crazy.
Russell.
WlNSTON: Nick!
- What?
What's with all the hammering-- ?
Whoa, what the hell is this thing?
- This thing is creepy.
- Yeah.
It's called a scarecrow.
Okay?
Birds keep coming after my plants.
Whatever you're doing, just stop with the hammering.
Me and Shelby are downstairs trying to make love.
- Did you honestly just say that?
- Dude, we're making love.
It's beautiful.
Who have you become?
- I'm happy.
Am I not allowed?
- You're allowed.
It's annoying the way you're doing it.
- You know what I don't care about?
WlNSTON: Mm-hm.
Shelby!
Oh, Shelby loves puzzles!
Oh, Shelby loves doughnuts, but hates doughnut holes.
- Why you hating on Shelby so much?
- I used to be your Shelby!
- That came out wrong.
- I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was my fault that your life sucks and you're so miserable.
You look like one of those guys who crawls out of the grave in the "Thriller" video.
- I want you to get.
- Seriously?
- I want you to get off my farm!
- This is a little weird, man.
- You used to be my best friend.
- Talk to yourself, man.
- So get!
- I'm getting!
- I don't need you!
WlNSTON: Shut up!
- Hey, Russell.
Mm-hm - Do I ever drive you crazy?
- Of course not.
Come on.
There must something that I do that just, like, gets under your skin.
- No, I can't think of anything.
- Come on, Russell, think.
Think, think, think.
Think.
That's annoying, right?
The way I say "think", with a K. Okay, Jess, um Your eyes bug out a little when you're trying to make a point.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
And you do this squatting thing - when you're thinking sometimes.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
I don't love that.
Like that?
Like that?
I've never actually seen those together so it's not a favorite of mine.
So is this just driving you crazy?
Um, no, but it's not pleasant.
- Hey, you're not pleasant.
Oh, no.
You're not pleasant.
- That's not nice.
It's not nice.
- Yeah.
- It's passion!
- Oh.
Uh - You hurt my teeth, I think.
- What you gonna do about it?
Uh, well, I mean, probably nothing.
- You know, I hate this shirt.
- Okay.
You know, could you please?
Thank you.
Ahh.
There it is.
There's the fire.
Where have you been hiding it, Rusty?
Where?
I'm gonna, um, make some tea.
Want some tea with chamomile?
- No!
- Okay, I mean, oolong-- The oolong-- You know, oolong-- ?
Ugh, I hate that you have so many coasters.
- Why?
- It's actually kind of a funny story-- - You just coasting through life?
- This isn't great.
Not at all.
What do-- ?
You know, now I'm pissed.
What is this?
Something's missing.
I didn't know it until I saw you and Ouli together the other night almost strangle each other.
But then it clicked.
I want that.
I want what you and Ouli have.
You want me to treat you like my ex-wife?
Who I hate.
I don't know, I just-- You guys have the spark.
And I want that spark.
You have to admit you have this spark, this passion.
Passion's overrated, Jess.
I knew we shouldn't have gone to that dinner.
I wanna go home.
Jess.
Just-- Can you just take me home?
NlCK: Get in there.
Useless.
You-- - Get in there!
- What is this?
Martin Scorsese's The Wizard of Oz?
- Sorry about what happened on the roof.
- Apology accepted.
It's just we used to be miserable together, man.
- We did have some pretty bad times.
- Heh.
Yeah.
We had the worst.
Remember we pooled our money and bought that dating profile?
- Ha, ha.
Yeah.
- Ha, ha.
The ladies did not care for Ninston Biller.
- Zero dates.
- Zero.
I'm sorry that I can't be happy for you.
I wanna know what's wrong with me.
- Want me to tell you?
- Not really.
Why are you giving up?
Something doesn't work out, what do you do?
Make an adjustment, give it one more shot.
That's what I did with-- - Just say it.
Shelby.
- My beautiful Shelby.
Why you did say "my beautiful Shelby"?
Look, I just called her out of the blue, okay?
And then I was a different person and she was a different person.
Now look at us, man.
We're eating sandwiches and making love to one another.
Sandwiches and sex?
I want that!
Hey.
How, um?
How was your date last night?
Brief.
Small man go to hospital.
The hospital?
- ls he okay?
- I don't know.
I leave him there.
I go make bowling.
Nadia, like, honestly, what did you do to him?
He cry and cry.
It was so funny.
Heh.
Oh, my God.
There's me.
I really like what we had.
I thought you did too.
I do, I did.
It's just, Russell--  Seems to happen every time you're in this car.
But there's so many buttons, it's like-- The Batmobile doesn't have so many buttons.
Look, Jess, I've already done the crazy, explosive passion thing.
When I was with Ouli, it was like edging closer and closer to a woodchipper.
I'm not looking for that anymore.
I understand but I am.
And I want passion even if it's harder and hurts more.
So that's it?
Goodbye, Russell.
Agh.
- Yup.
- Yup.
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?
How do you look this good under fluorescent lights?
I am so, so sorry, okay?
This is all my fault.
I thought-- What happened?
Yeah.
Um, this is embarrassing.
I broke my penis.
- You what?
- I broke my penis.
Things got, I mean, just out of control with Nadia last night.
And there was, like, this one moment where it was just blinding pain.
Then there was another moment where I was watching myself watch myself.
I finally understand what The Tree of Life is about.
And I can't be certain of this but I am almost positive that Nadia's vagina contains a right angle.
- I'm leaving.
- How are you upset right now?
Cece, you ended this.
- I don't know what you want from me.
- I don't want you sleeping with Nadia.
Are you crazy?
I don't want you sleeping with anyone.
Because I like you.
I can't just always say what I feel, okay?
It's just-- Just whatever, Schmidt.
You like me.
- You like my personality?
- I was surprised too.
Come on.
- What happened?
- Oh, my God!
Why?
Agh!
- What?
- God, my penis is having a heart attack.
- Don't touch me.
Get out of here.
- Okay.
I mean, I like-- Don't bend over, for crying out loud!
What are you, nuts?
- I'm sorry.
It's the yoga pants.
- Sorry for this, but I like you.
I like you too so much.
Call a nurse.
A male nurse.
Probably a heavyset male nurse would be nice.
- Bye.
- Describe it to them as, like, a battered highway cone.
Agh.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Caroline, how you doing?
Good.
I'm just going to use the bathroom.
- Caroline?
- I know.
I called her and-- I don't know.
What are you doing?
You guys had a terrible relationship.
Are you crazy?
- Are you burning incense?
- Yes, I am.
For ambiance.
She digs it.
She digs it?
Are you kidding, Nick?
What happened?
What happened to swearing off women and focusing on tomatoes?
I can't grow tomatoes, Jess.
I think this is what was supposed to happen all along.
Me and Caroline.
And I'm okay with it.
- I'm happy.
- Pathetic.
You're just saying that because you don't have the courage to be alone.
CAROLlNE: I will never get used to those urinals.
Hey, give me a second?
I have to talk to Jess.
- Oh, sure.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Bye, Caroline.
- Bye.
- See you in one second.
- What is your problem?
- Have fun making terrible life decisions.
Oh, you just know everything, don't you?
- I'm actually so sick of you.
- I'm just really disappointed in you.
Maybe I'll be more like you, go into the kitchen, make pastries with sprinklies.
- That's not what I do.
- Throw some dumb pajama outfit on then tell other people how to live their lives.
It's not a pajama outfit!
They're called pajamas, Nick!
- That's what I said!
- Go back in your room and put on your stupid flannel and keep not living up to your potential!
You're a crazy person!
I'm just saying things you don't wanna hear!
Know what I would like?
- What?
- Silence!
- I'm not gonna be silent!
- Shut up for one second!
- I'm trying to help!
- Please be quiet!
- No!
No!
- I don't want your help!
Stop making that face.
I hate that!
This is my only face!
Don't have a lot of faces!
And if you don't like looking at my face, Jess then look at my ass!
Oh!
- Yeah, get a good look.
- Stop shaking your ass!
- This is the ass of a failure!
- You get a look.
- Look right at my ass.
- Now, Nick!
- You bought the ticket, take a ride.
- Feast your eyes on my butt.
- I'm winning this.
- Quitter.
- Look.
It's going faster than yours!
- I have the fastest butt.
- I got a faster one!
No, you don't!
- What are we doing?
- Stop looking at my ass!
I'm gonna kill you.
Quitter.
You really think Nick is gonna believe that a tomato just sprung up overnight?
Yes, I do.
When it comes to tomatoes no one in the world knows less than Nick.
- So how long you gotta ice that thing?
- Eight weeks.
I mean, if I have any excitement, it's excruciating pain.
- Boobies.
- What?
- Boobies.
- I love boobies.
Girls with clean hair.
- This is the least funny game played.
- Models eating sliders.
- Unh!
- Bernadette Peters on a high beam.
Freshly baked bread.
SCHMlDT: Oh, God!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Wish I had a river I could skate away on Hey, Jess.
I brought you some tea.
Just gonna leave it right here, okay?
There you go.
So, Russell, ouch, right?
Who saw that coming?
Not me.
Heh.
Certainly not Russell.
I guess you saw it coming because you're the one who broke up with him.
- Leave, Schmidt.
- I'll leave.
But you know what?
Know this.
You're not the only one hurting, Jessica Day.
The economy stinks, bees are dying movies are pretty much all sequels and l - Don't say "broken penis".
- have a broken penis.
Don't pretend to know my pain.
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey.
- What's this song called?
- "The River".
- Hm.
- Do you like it?
I liked it when you played it the first time at 10:00 last night.
I liked it a little bit less at 2 a.m. Now I'm hoping the sun comes up, thaws that river, and that woman drowns.
Get out.
Russell was perfect.
What's wrong with me?
Am I self-sabotaging?
Am I secretly a Cylon?
- You just didn't love him.
- What if it's me?
What if I have some idea of love in my head and it's just totally wrong?
Do not second-guess yourself, okay?
It was a tough choice, but it was the right choice.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
So, what do you think about turning off that song?
- I just feel like-- - Off.
Turn it off.
Ow.
It's coming on Christmas They're-- WlNSTON: Oh, my God, she's dead.
SCHMlDT: Come on, 80 more times.
I get it now.
It's a river.
All right, now let's go and get a drink.
Because you really need to get out of this room.
- I'm not ready.
- Turn that song back on.
Caroline and I made up a routine to cheer you up.
- No, you didn't.
CAROLlNE: I'm gonna dance and Nick's gonna clap.
NlCK: Ooh.
- You about ready now?
- Yeah, I'm ready now.
- Ooh, ah.
Feel it.
Uh, uh.
Get it, Caroline.
Get it, Caroline.
Born to dance.
Dance.
JESS : Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess I'm gonna end up alone.
I'm gonna be a single old lady flashing people on the subway.
Jess, first of all, you're never gonna be old.
Because humans, we're gonna be immortal by 2026.
- Second of all, give me your phone.
- Why?
Do you want to drunkenly call Russell, tell him what a mistake you made?
- You don't wanna backslide.
- Be quiet.
Your life is too perfect to talk to anyone in Jess' condition.
Look, Jess, backsliding is what happens after a clean break when you freak out and you go crawling back and you just make everything messy and horrible.
- I'm not gonna do that.
- You have "backslider" written all over.
Did I tell you my boss invited me to play poker with him tonight?
Crazy thing, he never invites anybody to play poker with him.
- I'm in the prime of my life.
- Winston, shut up.
- I need my phone.
- No.
I need to call Russell to tell him I left my pajamas there.
The fact that you are wearing pajamas in the presence of your lover tells me that relationship was doomed.
No.
Don't fake me out.
- Are you guys playing a game?
SCHMlDT &  No.
Hey, good-looking.
- Hey.
- What can I get you?
How about one of those Nick Miller Manhattans?
Ah, straight bourbon in a plastic cup.
CAROLlNE: Heh-heh.
- Come with me.
- Think we should show him the DVD?
- What DVD?
Nick made a DVD after the last time Caroline broke up with him.
All the reasons why they shouldn't get back together.
- We hid it somewhere in the loft.
- Ooh, intrigue.
Mama like.
I don't know that we-- Cece's here.
Why is she dressed like a Women's Studies major?
SCHMlDT: It's precautionary, just until my junk heals.
Ow.
Owie.
Damn it.
WlNSTON: You okay?
SCHMlDT: No, I'm not okay.
- What is going on, Jess?
- I was thinking about this word that I learned from Schmidt: Backsliding.
So you're saying I'm a backslider?
I don't know what we're supposed to do together.
Everything turns you on.
Oh, look, Cece, a bird.
Ow.
Ah, damn it.
Schmidt, it's a mother bird in her nest.
- Must I say it, Cece?
- What?
- The eggs.
- Okay.
Okay, sure.
Look, did Caroline physically, mentally and emotionally abuse me for years?
Yes.
But she changed.
It's about timing.
And the first time around, we weren't ready to work at it and now we are.
And besides, Caroline is way hotter than that voice in my head who sounds like Tom Waits and tells me I'm a failure and I look bad in hats.
I don't wanna spend my whole life with him.
You know what I mean?
Okay.
You'll get a break from me tomorrow.
- I've got to go visit my dadi.
- What?
- My grandmother.
- Your bubbe?
- Yes, my-- - I have a bubbe.
- My bubbe is in a home.
- Old people freak me out.
With their hands and their legs They're like the human version of pleated pants.
- Really?
Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey.
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.
You aren't into old people?
SCHMlDT: Not at all.
I mean, just horrible.
Like giant walking raisins.
They're in a home It's me.
I've been thinking a lot about you.
Jess?
Mm?
I can't feel my arm.
Oh Whoa.
I really can't feel it at all.
Mm.
- Wake up, fella.
You're gonna be late for school.
Genzlinger.
What is that?
An earring.
What does it look like?
I got wasted last night with Joe and so I got my ear pierced.
This is the perfect moment.
- Wait.
I wanna do it.
- Wait, what?
I wanna do it.
- See, this is where it gets weird between us.
Traditionally, the male of the species is more glamorous.
- When's it coming out?
- The earring?
No, the smooth jazz album you're dropping.
Hey, guys.
You remember, um, Paul?
- Mercedes Genz.
WlNSTON: Genzel Washington.
It's the Genz of the world as we know it.
Everybody, put down your Genz and your Genzils.
- Hey, Schmidt.
What's up, Washington?
WlNSTON: Hm?
Um, hey, so-- Maybe-- Okay.
We'll definitely--  All right.
Okay.
Okay.
- Okay.
All right.
- Backslider.
- Don't.
- You backslid.
- Come on.
You backslid all the way down the hill and back into the parking lot.
Take off your skis and wait for your family in the lodge, Jessica Day.
Look, this could be good.
Paul and I had bad timing before.
And maybe I should just give it another shot.
- Such an ugly crier.
- He is the all-time worst crier.
It's like he has a slow-motion sneeze.
Winston, what is in your ear?
- It's hot.
- Does that feed information to Shelby to keep track of your migration?
- Drop it.
- Please, Jess.
- He just got back from Carnival.
- No, l-- These people are disgusting.
I've never been more flaccid in my life.
Heh.
- Thank God.
I mean, this place is a cardigan gold mine.
- Can I get you anything, Dadi?
- A hot-blooded man in a hotel room.
Oh, just get me a puzzle.
- Yeah?
- I raised that girl.
She is my life.
And she's not as tough as she looks.
If you hurt her, I will let myself die and then I will haunt you.
- Whoa.
Look at this fireplace, it's huge.
- Caroline, that is not a fireplace.
That is, like, a room you could safely set on fire.
- This is really nice.
So grown-up.
- lt is.
But where is all your stuff gonna go?
Like, where will the Grateful Dead bears dance?
Didn't realize I lived here too.
Seriously, what do you think about moving in?
Wait, you want to move in together?
Yeah, I mean, I feel like if we're gonna do this again, we should do it for real.
- Right.
- I mean, I'm 33 years old.
- You're 30 years old, we're the same age.
- No, I lied about that.
I'm 33.
I don't want to start at the beginning again with you.
I mean, you're not not making sense.
- Knock-knock.
- Hi.
- Hi back.
- Heh.
- Um.
I-- - I have something to tell you.
- Oh.
Sorry.
You go first.
- I'll go first.
Um, I was thinking a lot about, um, you and last night.
- Right.
- And we have something good.
Jess, I have a girlfriend.
- What?
- Yup.
A very serious girlfriend.
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you tell me?
When you called me, we'd gotten into this fight - and I was really confused.
- You were cheating on her with me?
- ls that bad?
That's bad.
- It's really bad.
- Oh, no, that's really bad.
- Why would you do that?
Now I know what Bill Clinton feels like.
Now I know how Monica Lewinsky feels.
I'm sorry I made you feel like Monica.
Stop crying.
You are literally the ugliest crier I have ever seen.
- You cry-smile.
- Hey, babe, I'm here for lunch.
- Oh.
- Oh.
Oh, no, are you crying?
Is everything okay?
There's-- I'm sorry to break it to you, but that is the way the electoral college works, man.
It-- It seems so unfair.
- So votes don't mean as much?
- lt upsets me too.
- I'm gonna miss you.
- What do you mean?
I'm gonna miss you when your caravan moves onto the next village.
Oh, my God.
He has a girlfriend.
He cheated on his girlfriend with me.
- I'm a cheater.
- P. Genz played you?
I saw her.
She looks like an Asian me.
Asian Jess, wh-- Ow.
I can't even backslide right.
I've been her.
I've been Asian me before.
Are you gonna keep calling her "Asian me"?
It's becoming a problem.
I don't know her name.
But I do know that if I were her, I'd wanna know what kind of person I was dating.
- That's why I have to tell her.
SCHMlDT: Please don't do that.
Sometimes when you make a mistake, all you can do is own up to it, all right?
Because it's something you can't fix.
Knowledge.
Take it easy, black George Michael.
I have to do it.
I have to tell her.
Sixty-one years we've been together, - and four different Batmen.
- Why don't we go for a walk?
- I'm gonna go get your sweater.
Thanks, sweetie.
Give me one second.
- Wow, so you guys are like real live Yodas, huh?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Shoot, cowboy.
- How do you build a relationship?
- How about Viagra?
I use it just to keep from falling out of bed.
How does a guy like me have a chance at making someone like Cece happy?
You don't.
Not with all those moles on your face.
- I should just give up.
- That's crazy.
She needs you.
You are exactly what she needs.
- Here's your sweater, Dadi.
- Thank you.
Um, I'll meet you out there in a second, okay?
Okay.
Take it easy, Burt.
You know, for the first time in my life I feel like I want something that lasts.
And I want it with you.
I feel the same way.
You do?
- Oh!
- Oh.
Aah!
- lt hurts so bad.
- What's turning you on?
SCHMlDT: Oh!
Oh!
The queen of diamonds?
The boat?
The teeth in the glass?
- I care about you so much, but--  The leaf painting?
Is emotional intimacy turning you on?
Are you in that much pain?
He passed out.
We need help.
- Yo.
What's up?
- How'd the audition go?
- What?
- For the Disney pirate movie?
- Ha-ha.
- Mr. T called.
He wants to punch you because that looks stupid.
- Lil Wayne wears it, so-- - Little Wayne Gonzalez from Brazil?
Who came to the United States to dance and be free?
Ah!
Baby, I'm in the prime of my life.
- What you been doing all day?
- I'm actually looking for an apartment.
It's for Caroline.
She asked me to move in with her.
I'm thinking about it.
- Cool.
Cool.
Sounds like so much fun.
- I'm glad that's your reaction.
I thought you'd say I'm making a mistake.
- Honestly, I didn't want to hear that.
- Yeah, that'd be silly.
Heh-heh-heh.
- What are you doing?
WlNSTON: Huh?
- No, no, no.
- Nick.
Nick.
- Nick.
Nick.
NlCK: Don't.
- It's for your own good.
- Get off me.
No, Schmidt.
Grab him.
Okay, grab him.
- You got him?
You got him?
- Watch the television.
Watch it.
Watch the television.
Watch the TV.
Watch the TV.
- Hello, Nick.
NlCK: No!
In all its glory.
Watch it.
You magnificent dumbass.
If you're watching this, it's because you decided - to get back with Caroline.
- Yes, Nick.
I did.
Well, congratulations, you idiot.
- She destroyed you.
- You don't know me, you jerk.
These, my dumb friend, are your tears.
You saved them all.
Think back, Nick, or whatever they call you in your time.
Who dumped you three times?
Once before your brother's wedding?
He's divorced.
I' ll get another shot.
- This is a poem you wrote.
- I don't want the poem.
But you're too emotional to read it right now.
You're gonna give it to Schmidt for safe-keeping.
- This is your doing, Caroline.
- You were right to trust me.
Two years I held this thing.
- Read it.
- Here they come.
NlCK: Okay.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
No, a summer's day is not a bitch  That's how you wanna talk about Caroline?
WlNSTON: I can't move, my earring is stuck.
NlCK: There's something I wanna do to you.
WlNSTON: Don't move.
Don't move.
- Let's act like men.
WlNSTON: Aah!
NlCK: You wanna act like men?
Let's act like men.
Look at how far you've come, Nick.
- Wanna be a bartender forever?
- I still am.
You wanna be a grown man who dresses like an unsponsored professional skateboarder?
You don 't wanna live like this.
You're moving on.
You're doing the right thing, so just keep going.
Can I talk to you Nick-to-Nick for a second?
I respect you.
You're rocking the hell out of that beard the long hair looks good, despite what other people are gonna say.
The Caroline that broke your heart, I get why you don't like her.
But it's a different Caroline that's picking me up in five minutes.
Do you want me to live alone in this loft for the rest of my life?
Hey, what's the difference between me and Bill Cosby?
Thanks, guys.
You helped me figure something out.
All right, I think this was a really nice talk, Future Nick.
I hope you got something from it, because I know that I did.
- I'm gonna call her.
- No.
Give me the phone.
- Coach, he's calling her again.
- We lost him.
We sure did, Captain Black Sparrow.
- Hey, Paul.
Hey.
I'm not going to let you lie to your girlfriend.
Okay?
It's not fair to her.
So you have to tell her what happened between us or I will.
- You're right.
I have to tell her.
- Yeah.
I'm so scared though.
I don't wanna lose her.
Jess, she's my soul mate.
For someone with a soul mate, you sure had sex with me.
I know, I know.
I don't expect you to believe me.
I wouldn't believe me if I were you.
But check it out.
I even bought her an engagement ring.
Oh.
- That's beautiful.
- I've been carrying it for weeks trying to find the right way to propose.
I just started panicking, and I got-- I don't know, I got scared and really confused.
I'm so sorry to drag you into this but this was a big mistake.
- Paul, don't make me feel sorry for you.
- I know, I messed up big time.
And I'm gonna lose her.
Oh, God, I can't lose her.
Hey, babe, you left your tuner in my car.
Oh.
Hi.
You're Jess, right?
I'm Jenn.
Jenn.
- Well, I was just leaving-- - Jess and I slept together.
- Oh, God.
- What?
I wanna be honest.
It happened two days ago, we did lots of stuff.
There was talking, there were hands, we ruined a pillow.
He's making it sound more erotic than it was.
It was just like lying there and bleurgh.
I'm so sorry.
I'm begging you to forgive me.
- I thought that you loved me.
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
No.
I'm such an idiot.
- Bye, Paul.
- Wait.
Wait, Jenn-- - Haven't you done enough?
- Yeah, I have.
I have done enough.
But I know how you feel.
I've been there.
I've been cheated on before and it feels like someone dropped an anvil on your heart.
Um, but that guy wasn't right for me.
You guys-- You guys are perfect together.
I thought you were Asian me, but now I realize I'm just Caucasian you.
- What?
- What?
Paul was scared.
And when you're scared, you do stupid things.
- He made a really terrible mistake.
- Really terrible.
The things we did 48 hours ago were so dark-- - I'm handling this.
- Sorry.
Jenn, you love Paul.
I know that because you're still here.
What you guys have, it's way bigger than me.
And I think Paul has something to ask you.
This is not the right time to do this.
In fact, this is a terrible time to do this, but I don't care.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Jennifer Ruth Toyoji.
- I know that now.
- Now that you slept with her?
- Happy to help.
Uh-huh.
If you still love me at all Of course I still do.
Oh, yeah.
Um  - Will you-- ?
Will you marry him?
- Yeah.
- ls that a yes?
- Yes.
You and Cece are staying away from each other?
Only until my penis stops looking like a knotted wizard's staff.
- Sounds tough, man.
- Guys like us, Nick too, we're warriors.
We just keep on fighting and holding on even when we know we're just making a mistake.
Like Nick and Caroline.
- And that earring.
- I'm not giving this up.
You look like you were caught by a fisherman.
I've had it with the jokes.
You look like you should be standing in line to get into Shaquille's birthday party.
Oh, my God, guys.
The most exciting thing just happened.
I helped Paul propose to his girlfriend.
They're engaged.
You're leaving out a part of that.
- Where's Nick?
I wanna tell him.
- This should be fun.
Um Nick has something to tell you too.
He's in the bathroom.
Oh, great.
- Really?
- She's gonna find out anyway.
- Nick.
Nick.
Hey.
- What, Jess?
Um Paul proposed to his girlfriend in front of me.
- That sounds awkward.
- She said yes.
And it was really beautiful.
And it made me realize something.
You're wrong.
All the stuff you said about Caroline being about timing and it just making sense?
No.
Because if you really love someone, it's simple.
I understand what you're saying, but-- You deserve something amazing.
And you deserve love.
I know you don't want to be alone, but I'm gonna be there.
I'll tell that Tom Waits voice in your head to shut up.
We don't have to settle, Nick.
You're the best.
I'm moving in with Caroline.
We signed the lease this morning.
Thanks for saying all that stuff.
Now that I got your attention, Future Nick there's a few things I'd like to talk to you about.
Be nicer to your ma when she calls.
Stop giving yourself high fives.
Put your head underwater, you 2-year-old.
Be nicer to Coach or he's gonna take off.
Live with other white people.
I know fake karate.
I'm Nick, I'm grumpy.
I'm going to put my baby hood on.
Sex is a sprint, not a marathon.
You are special, you are special You-- We'll see each other in the future, unless I see you first.
Nick Miller.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Here you guys go, some cookies.
Okay, great.
As you know, I'm moving in with Caroline.
And I'm glad we can talk about this like adults.
- Caroline is, uh, quite the baker.
- Anything else?
Anyone?
You're making a huge, life-ruining mistake by moving in with a woman who turned you into an agoraphobic, turtle-faced, borderline alcoholic.
I'm gonna start over because this did not go the way I had planned.
As you know, I'm leaving, so there are things we need to work out.
What am I gonna do with extra money now that I don't have to cover for you?
- Okay.
- Maybe I'll buy a city.
Open a mall and call it Winston's Corners.
What are you doing?
Just sitting here, letting this happen?
What?
The guy obviously knows what he wants.
- I do.
SCHMlDT: When Nick leaves I'm gonna call a plumber and throw cash at him while he works.
Fifties and hundreds, hundreds, hundreds.
Call an exterminator.
Get rid of that crime against nature.
Yeah, he's not fooling anyone.
Because he's a snappy dresser, the mice don't see the hammer?
Mice come from all over the building to laugh at that dummy witch.
Is this a carob chip?
Are you trying to buy our love with hippie chocolate?
You idiot.
Aren't you gonna miss this, Nick?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
- Who's that girl?
Who's that girl?
It's Jess  Can you take me to the doctor tomorrow?
He's taking the bandages off.
The old Washington Monument, ready to serve this great nation again.
Okay, can you stop?
Time to make this horse into a unicorn.
Can we save this until after interviewing Neil to take Nick's room?
Hey, don't worry about me.
I could talk about my dingus all night long.
Tell us about yourself.
You know, anything we should know?
Aside from the fact that you responded to our Craigslist ad with a fax.
Well, um, yeah, my name is "Neil".
Um, just coming out of a pretty hairy divorce.
I am in human resources.
Well, I used to be.
I had the unique experience of having to let myself go.
I did not take it well.
- Let me ask a question.
- Save questions till the end.
Are you gonna be a wuss about things like crabs and bedbugs?
Like crabs from Maine?
I hope you like feminist rants.
That's kind of my thing.
Neil, she's just saying this to scare you.
- What are you doing?
- Shut up.
- I'm a cutter.
- I want you to give us a minute.
- I gotta go talk to my roommates.
SCHMlDT: Oh, yeah.
You're acting insane.
I'm acting insane.
That guy's insane.
Jess, when you moved in, we had to roll with it.
To be fair, you do some pretty weird stuff.
I still can't get used to the way you let us know when you're using the toilet.
- I'm good with Neil.
- I am too.
What are you guys doing?
Nick's leaving.
You're his friends.
Aren't you gonna fight for him to stay?
You're in.
Aw!
Yes.
Okay.
And get ready for songs, because I am kind of a troubadour.
This is happening, Nick.
This is happening.
Whoa.
Whoa, why are you taking back your lamp?
You just answered that when you called it my lamp.
No, man.
Squatter's rights.
- What's wrong?
Still afraid of the dark?
- What?
No.
Because if you are, I'll leave this behind.
Okay, I'm not afraid of the dark.
But if I were afraid of the dark that would be a totally rational, adaptive, evolutionary response.
- Good night, Winston.
- I'm not afraid of the dark.
Good night, sweetheart.
Unless the monsters get you.
You and I should have a baby Hey, you came.
- Whoa, what you got in there?
- It's a hard cast.
Yeah, things didn't go quite like we had hoped at the doctor.
So I told the guy I had never been snowmobiling in my life, you know.
- Oh, God!
Ah.
- That's not my penis.
But on the bright side it's impossible for me to get aroused in this thing.
Say something hot to me.
Somethin' like a Cheese McGriddle Fresh pressed linens.
- Nope, nothing.
Not an inch.
- Wow.
Like a swaddled baby.
- They're ready for us.
- Oh, okay.
Just hang out, okay?
Have fun.
I'll drink your rum, girl My French-toast stick will make you hum You got that sex syrup  That's right, ride that missile.
Grip it.
You've got a tankful of jet fuel, you're heading straight for the sun.
What the hell war is this?
Turn around and face him.
- Am I supposed to wanna buy a missile?
I don't understand.
Just pounding the drum of war.
What, no one listened to Eisenhower?
All right, so that's everything.
I took my fair share of rubber bands, so I don't wanna hear about it.
In my room, you will find a shoe box.
In that box, there is a guinea pig that I said I would bury.
- So deal with it.
- A corpse in your room?
Thanks for helping.
What are we standing in a circle like a bunch of weirdos?
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah?
Why are you rushing this?
You have so much time.
Why not just take a second and think about this?
I feel confident.
I couldn't be more confident, Jess.
Are you?
Yeah.
- Are you?
- Yes.
- Are you really?
- Thanks for helping me move.
I love the way he smelled.
Caroline and I are starting a whole new life together.
Now we're trying to decide between eggshell and soft mint for the walls.
My gut says that eggshell is trying too hard but soft mint is really tricky to match.
- Have I told you about the bay windows?
- Yes, you have.
They are stunning, right?
I'm gonna curl up in those like a damn cat.
That's the place.
SCHMlDT: That's the place?
NlCK: Yeah.
- Aren't you gonna stop?
- Yeah.
Seems like I should.
- Um Hey, Nick?
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?
- I'm freaking out!
Yeah!
Oh, no.
Oh, Nick Miller is freaking out again!
Whoop-dee-whoo.
What's new?
Ha, ha, ha.
Come on.
- What the hell?
You think he's okay, man?
- Oh, no.
He's totally fine.
We do this every day.
We just never invite you, Winston.
What have I done?
Nick, I'm pretty sure you overshot the apartment by like 140 miles.
Let's just hop back in the truck, turn around and go home.
- Yeah, yeah.
You're right.
WlNSTON: Okay?
- Okay.
- This is crazy.
- I drove out here.
WlNSTON: Yeah, it is.
- I'll drive you to Caroline.
- Caroline's?
- No!
- No!
Well, that was unexpected.
I like to move in, move in I like to move in, move in I like to move in I like it quiet, quiet.
I rode up in the elevator with that guy and something growled in that box.
I hope he has a pet.
It would cheer me up.
- Schmidt here?
- He's helping Nick move.
But Neil is.
Wanna do a sex-only thing with him?
He came by my shoot earlier and was so jealous.
He was freaking out the entire time.
It's him.
Hold on.
Hi, Schmidt.
How's it going?
How's the new apartment?
Does it smell like new paint and compromise?
Heh, heh.
What?
Where?
There's not much sunlight left.
- What are you afraid of, the dark?
- Not the dark.
Schmidt.
He's a Jew in the desert.
I don't want him to wander.
- That's Caroline.
What do I tell her?
- There's freaking fire ants everywhere.
Give me a sec.
Hey.
Nick, where are you?
In the desert.
- The what?
NlCK: Yeah, I kind of I kind of freaked out and Look, I know it's a lot.
Just get back here as soon as you can and we'll figure it out.
Really?
I love you.
I love you too.
I overreacted by throwing my keys earlier.
- Yeah?
- I don't why I ever doubted Caroline.
- She's the best.
- So why the hell throw your keys away?
- I deserve this.
- I'm gonna kill you!
Winston, no!
WlNSTON: The sun is going down!
SCHMlDT: Calm down.
- I'll kill you!
I'll kill you!
SCHMlDT: Enough.
Would you stop it?
- There's fire ants everywhere.
- Why are we fighting?
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank God.
WlNSTON: Hey, Jess, what took you so long?
You never wanna lose a race against the night.
Nice new place, Nick.
- It's very spacious.
NlCK: Yes, I'm an idiot.
Really nice.
- Hey.
It's for you.
What happened at the shoot?
You left before I had a chance to say goodbye.
Good stuff.
Sure.
It was hard to tell where you stopped and Goggles McHardbody began.
That's my job.
Gino is just some guy that I see around the office.
Except in my office, they rub us down with baby oil before we start.
Yeah, I get that.
Look, your business is selling sex.
Sure.
You're a sex worker.
You're an idiot.
If we leave now, I'm gonna be back to Caroline by 8:00.
- Caroline?
- I changed my mind.
I'm gonna move in.
I don't even care about this truck.
I'll get it tomorrow.
- We leave.
Get out of the desert.
- Sounds good.
Here's my question.
How are you gonna get there?
I think you're gonna drive me.
- I don't think so.
WlNSTON: What?
NlCK: Why did come out to the desert?
WlNSTON: What?
NlCK: Jess.
- Jess!
WlNSTON: No!
Come on!
People, just please listen to me!
Stop throwing your damn keys!
Werewolves come out at night, man.
I don't want nobody to eat me!
- I got thick thighs, I got a fat ass!
- Relax.
We are in the middle of the desert!
Nobody's gonna find our bodies!
- Come here.
- What?
You're having a nervous breakdown.
NlCK: Tow truck can't come until tomorrow.
Aren't you glad I have beer?
Hello.
- Look what I found.
NlCK: Don't.
No, I have to hear it.
I'm begging you, it's humiliating.
I made that when I was 14.
Nick, I have to hear this.
SCHMlDT: Turn it up.
Yeah.
NlCK : This next song goes out to a special girl, Gwen Bressler.
I know you like breakfast, but how do you feel about "Breakfast at Tiffany's" - Deep Blue Something?
- T errible.
This is a great song.
You guys are crazy.
Listen to the lyrics.
Oh, man.
I feel it in my body.
And we're falling apart Are you kidding me?
This is in my bones.
I say What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
Something, something Remember the time  NlCK: But Gwen, you don't know my name, do you?
How bizarre.
No.
- Oh, yes.
- And this is when Nick got cool again.
Oh, not you too?
NlCK: Oh, my God, I'm, like, back.
Thank you.
Make fun all you want.
I'm back!
I'm back.
Thank you for doing this.
Cruising down the freeway In the hot, hot sun Suddenly red-blue lights Flash up from behind Loud voice, "All move"  I'm gonna miss this, you guys.
Just all of us, together, making fun of Nick.
Okay.
Once there was this girl who All right, I get it.
I'm an idiot.
I see what you guys are doing.
I get it.
You're trying to force me to remember how great it is when we hang out - so I don't wanna leave.
- We're just having fun.
You think I'm dumb and I make bad decisions.
- But this isn't that.
SCHMlDT: What?
- Come on.
You're crazy.
Where are you going?
- To get my keys.
You're never gonna find your keys.
She couldn't quite explain it They'd always just been there What's wrong with you?
You're stress-eating meat.
Hey, Jess.
How many have you had?
- Like three.
- That's a lot of pig parts.
It's just Cece.
I thought it was so going well.
Yeah, you know, she's a good egg.
She's never gonna be happy with somebody like me.
What?
That's crazy.
- I'm gonna have to White Fang her.
- Schmidt, come on.
I try not to judge what you do but please don't tell me things like that.
No.
No, Jess.
Jess, the book White Fang.
- Oh.
- This guy befriends a wild creature but he must set the animal free.
That's what's best for it.
- I know the plot of White Fang.
- But the animal won't go.
So with a breaking heart, he throws stones at it until it runs away.
You want Cece to go away?
No.
I want her to be happy.
When you care about somebody, you do what's best for them.
Even if it sucks for you.
- Even if they're just a woof.
- A woof?
- A woof.
- A wolf.
That's what I said.
- A wolf.
- A woof.
- Come on, keys.
Hey, Nick.
- Let's come back in the morning.
- I don't wanna come back in the morning.
Okay, I wanna be in my new bed, in my new apartment with my new old girlfriend.
Okay, it's just I know I've been-- What?
- Oh, my God.
NlCK: Shh.
Oh, my God.
- Okay, just be cool.
What do we do?
- I don't know.
- Okay, but Jess, we have to do something.
- Shh.
- Meep, meep.
- What are you doing?
- Road Runner.
- I know.
Why would you do the Road Runner?
- Honestly, don't do that.
Jess-- - Meep, meep.
Jess, honestly, don't do the Road Runner to a coyote.
That's how you deal with coyotes.
- Coyotes hate roadrunners.
- You deal-- Coyotes wanna kill roadrunners!
- Meep, meep.
- Oh, you-- No disrespect.
It's watching us.
It's watching us.
- We need to talk.
- All right.
Not another "merlot is the whore of the vineyard" talks, is it?
This isn't working out.
Are you kidding right now?
Are you trying to end this with me?
Now go on.
You heard me.
Go on!
Go on, scram!
Go!
I hate you, go!
- Go back to your kind!
- Are you White Fanging me?
- Sorry.
What?
- White Fang, Schmidt.
The only book on your Kindle.
The one you wouldn't stop talking about.
Remember I said, "Please stop talking about White Fang".
And you said, "Someday I'm gonna do this to somebody".
That White Fang.
Uh-huh.
Why are you trying to push me away?
I saw your phone, Cece.
I saw the text message from Gino, your colleague.
- You went through my phone?
- What?
No.
Winston went through your phone-- That is not okay.
This is about trust, Schmidt, okay?
It's about trust, I told you how this was gonna be.
I asked you to get okay with it.
Why am I supposed to trust you?
You slept with me.
That doesn't say much about your taste in men.
And I have more than one book on my Kindle.
And a subscription to Cricket.
And a lot of PDFs.
- Doesn't he have somewhere to be?
- Oh, this is a disaster.
Why did you keep driving?
I don't wanna talk about this.
I know what you're gonna say.
No.
No, you don't know what I'm gonna say.
I want you to be happy.
And if that means moving in with Caroline then I think you should do it.
That's what you think?
- I think you need me too much.
- I'm gonna be fine.
- I am.
- I don't think so.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because I met you.
That's why I'm okay.
And that's why I can do this.
- What are you doing?
- To beat the coyote you be the coyote.
That's what I thought.
That's a dumb idea.
I'm not with her on this.
This is her move, not mine, sir.
- Ay, yi, yi, yi!
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- I did it!
Oh, my God.
I have so much dirt in my mouth, and I did it!
- Come here.
Nice job.
- I did it!
I did it.
Ay, yi, yi, yi!
Schmidt.
Hello?
Winston?
- Aah!
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!
He'll be fine.
I don't know.
Want some candy or something?
Found it in the truck.
- No.
- I don't want your dirty lolly.
WlNSTON: Guys!
SCHMlDT: Oh!
I survived, man, and I made it out alive.
Wait, wait, don't touch me.
There's pee everywhere.
Like, everywhere.
SCHMlDT: Pissed everywhere?
WlNSTON: I didn't just pee on me.
I peed-- Well, I peed on me, but other things peed on me too.
I saw things, man.
I had an experience.
I think I made out with the side of a dune.
Hey!
Look, I found my key.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Thank God.
- We still on for brunch?
- You gonna help me unload my stuff?
- No.
Not a chance.
- No.
Yeah, so I can't do brunch.
Just go.
Get in the car.
Unacceptable.
Good luck.
Well?
Well?
All right, I'll see you.
See you.
Wow.
Look how pronounced Nick's couch hole got.
All this time, I thought he was just sitting here, drinking beer and complaining - he was making something.
- Heh.
Hey.
What do you think?
NlCK : Hey, WNICK listeners.
This one is going out to all the ladies I'm gonna meet when I grow up.
- Not.
- Not.
Hey.
