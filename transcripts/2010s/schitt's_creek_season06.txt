{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 Alexis:   Agh!
Agh!
Are you sure you don't want any help with that?
I fit my high school best friend into a suitcase way smaller than this when we were crossing the border between Laos and Vietnam, so I'm pretty sure I can figure this out.
Ooh, I can't wait to get to the Galapagos and like, breathe the sea air and get my Beach curls back.
Yeah, you've mentioned that a couple times.
Are you still trying to close that thing?
- Agh!
- Boys, it looks like I won't be able to see that wedding venue with you today, your mother's had a bit of a relapse.
Take it the "Crows" movie is still shelved.
I'm sorry, we've started looking at wedding venues and no one chose to tell me?
Touring a wedding venue is an incredibly intimate thing and we wanted to keep it small.
You invited Dad.
Okay, I don't know what that's supposed to mean, Alexis.
Moira: John, something's happening!
Coming, Moira.
Don't make any sudden moves.
Okay, you should probably stay here.
- No, you shouldn't - Okay.
John, remind me to reprimand that latch, it's been awfully moody today.
Well, good-good morning, Sweetheart.
Look who's come to see you.
Finally.
I'll have the continental breakfast with the fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.
-  - Orange Pekoe tea.
No, Moira, Moira, it's - it's David and Patrick.
Um?
Don't we have something we want to say?
Yes, thank you, John.
Sadly, I won't be able to squire you for today's wedding venue peregrination.
You invited Mom?
She's literally been asleep in a closet for a week.
Just know that missing this will be the heavy-hearted part of my day.
Okay, does nobody care that I'm going to be gone for six months?
Yes, of course we care, Honey.
- Don't we, Moira?
- Take me with you.
Okay.
On that note, I think we should get you out of the room.
Alexis, you are more than welcome - to come see the place with us.
- Thank you.
That actually works out super well for me because you guys can just drive me straight to the airport after.
Hm-hm-hm.
- See what you've done there?
- Yeah.
Mhmm.
Out.
Out, out, out.
John!
Can you turn off your alarm?
David!
I've asked you not to over indulge in that smoky cologne, it's enough to give someone a seizure!
Is someone vaping?
-  - Oh no, not now!
Help!
Alexis!
No, this is not, this is not how I go!
Somebody help!
Moira!
Oh, Stevie, thank God.
I'm being annulled by a chancy door clasp!
Okay, hang on.
Ahhh!
Okay, all right, all right, okay.
Up, up.
There we go.
Jeez, Moira, I wait 'til at least 10:30 before I have my first beer.
Oh, my legs are in slumber.
Carry me.
Oh I can't Oh jeez, okay.
Hang on.
You know, Moira, if Johnny locked you in that closet, we're going to have to call the police.
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
My babies - No, your kids aren't here.
- My girls.
- What girls?
- My girls.
- Lorna, second from the left.
- Okay.
If she takes on smoke, she'll never recover.
- Okay, this?
This one?
- And Cindy!
Cindy, below her.
Cindy, I just gave her a blowout.
Wow.
This place looks nice.
Yeah, it's the only venue for miles that doesn't look like a crime scene from a missing person docu-series.
Uh, so no one thought to tell me I still have my show makeup on?
I thought that was a choice.
Yeah, I left Stevie double-fisting drinks in a hot tub at the cabaret wrap party last night.
I think I saw you triple-fisting at one point.
Ah, welcome to Elmbridge Manor, and you must be the happy couple.
- Oh no, not quite.
- God, no.
Oh, ladies, I'm so sorry.
Congratulations.
- Champagne?
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Thank you.
- Mhmm, hi.
David Rose.
I'm the one getting married and this is my partner, Patrick.
- Hi.
- So.
Gentlemen, please forgive me.
I looked at your friend's face and thought someone had just come from her make up trial.
Now, if our grooms and the uh, other couple would like to follow me, - I will begin our tour.
- Wonderful.
You look great.
All of our catering is provided by the neighboring farm.
We have fresh cheeses, breads, meats.
Oh, now I do apologize if the peonies back there were a little overwhelming, it rained last night and they just bloomed.
It's perfect.
David, I know you've made me relinquish most, if not all of the wedding planning to you at this point, but for what it's worth, this place is beautiful.
- I think this is it.
- Mhmm.
I think this is it, guys!
See, David?
Imagine if I wasn't here for this moment.
Mhmm, okay.
Glad you're here.
So, do we have a winner?
If you're happy, I'm happy.
We have a winner, Clive!
- Yes!
-  It's a hell of a story, Johnny.
So I'm next door, I'm cleaning the bathroom and I want a snack.
So I grab some of those jail time toaster pops and I put them in the toaster, - and suddenly there's a fire.
- Oh, Roland.
Why do they call them toaster pops if it says on the box, "Do not toast"?
How mercurial is life?
We all imagine being carried from the ashes by the Goddess Artemis and here I get a balatron from Barnum and Bailey.
-  - Okay.
I, I have no idea what that means, but it doesn't sound good.
Okay, I'm gonna go to lunch.
Gotta get this burnt toaster pop taste out of my mouth.
Excuse me.
Moira.
I'm just glad you're okay.
Hm.
And first thing in the morning, I'm going in and I'm fixing these latches.
No need, John.
I have been gifted a smoke signal and you will never again find me back in the closet.
Well, why don't we take this one step at a time?
This may come as a shock to you, dear, but I don't believe my career has been that kind to me.
- What?
- I all but perished in the name of an unrequited love for an industry that has burned me over and over again.
It's been difficult watching you go through this, Moira.
I know you'll want to fight me tooth and nail, John.
It's time my career took its final bow.
Now, if, if if that's what you want, Moira, just know that I'm here if you need me for anything.
Oh, I have never needed less.
Shall we take lunch outside today?
- What a great idea.
- Lay a blanket somewhere!
If you're feeling up for it, I mean I, I, I know you're still a bit shaken.
That's just it, John, I have never felt more lucid.
I'll fix a basket.
And I am including that Peruvian ayahuasca retreat we embarked upon with Al and Tipper.
Okay.
-  -  Okay, smiles over here please.
Ted wants to know what we're doing.
Okay, like, a little less eager and maybe one without Stevie.
- No offense.
- All right.
Alexis, could you put the phone down?
You're gonna be spending six months with Ted, I think the two of you can chill for a minute.
Okay, this is our pricing guide.
Starting with our gold, silver, and bronze packages.
But, as you'll see, we can really accommodate almost any request.
- Are these in dollars?
- Hm.
Okay, um is there a package lower than the bronze package?
Perhaps a copper package?
No, we can't accommodate that.
Did you not ask to see the prices in advance?
- They don't provide - We don't provide pricing in advance.
Well, now we know why.
This might be the worst day of my life.
Okay, look.
Um, you're clearly very desperate and I'm feeling terribly for you.
I don't love the way you phrase that.
Now, we did just have a cancellation earlier in the week for a Sunday afternoon.
- Sundays are good.
- We can work with that.
Now, the first Sunday of every month is discounted already and we're unlikely to find someone else this late in the game.
So, I would be happy to offer you an additional 30% off.
Oh my God!
Yes, but the only problem is: it's a month from today.
This is basically free!
David, that's not enough time.
We need to give people notice.
Uh, I planned my ex girlfriend's intervention in less than an hour.
Plus, it'll weed out all the dead weight.
Um I will not be here in one month, so I guess that makes me the dead weight?
I'm feeling a little tension.
We're gonna find another venue, okay?
We can't get married without Alexis.
Why?
She's the one that can't wait to get out of here.
I once dated someone who left me for a stuffed animal.
- I'm not having my big day - Our Our big day compromised because Alexis wanted to chill in a tankini for six months.
-  -  Honestly, David, if this is the kind of bride you're going to be, - I'm glad that I'm leaving.
- Wha?
And I would never wear a tankini!
Uh, just so you're aware, that is house made bacon from the farm up the road.
- Oh, give me this.
- Can is that for everyone?
- Oh, Please, please.
- Oh my God.
-  - Okay!
God.
Well, I guess congratulations are in order.
We didn't end up taking the venue.
Really?
What stopped you?
Did they like, run out of sandwiches or ?
Uh, yes.
But that's not why.
We don't want to get married without you here, okay?
- And?
- And, David?
And I didn't mean to make you feel excluded from the day.
Then again, when all you talk about is how excited you are to get out of here, I don't really feel like including you in stuff.
David, just say you're sorry so we can get your sister to the airport, okay?
- Nevertheless - Mhmm.
I might have overreacted - and for that, I am apologetic.
- Wow.
So, you're sorry.
I knew there was a reason I came on this trip.
-  - My God.
I am remorseful over an action I participated in.
- Dammit!
- What is going on?
- Car won't start.
- What?
!
Well, I can't be late for my flight!
Okay, well why don't you go inside and ask Clive for help then?
Because my feet are killing me, David.
- Oh my God!
- Why don't we go inside and see if there's anything Clive can do, okay?
Why do I feel like Clive doesn't handle stress well?
Come on.
Um, this might be a stupid question, but why are you wearing high heels on an airplane?
Oh, I'm not wearing them on the plane, they hand out slippers with the mimosas.
When was the last time you flew economy?
Hmm?
Hard to believe this is our first trip down to the creek.
You know, Moira, after the week we've had, this is the perfect way to end it.
To think I nearly made you a widower.
Oh, John, I can just see you aimlessly wandering through life.
Stoic but stymied, not a friend in the world and so very lost.
Well, you're here now, Moira, and so am I. And, with your career behind you, we'll be able to take advantage of more days like this.
Does this not remind you of that wellness retreat we went to in Evian, right after Alexis ended things with Sean Penn?
Yes.
You and I wandered down to the lake, ne'ery a person to be found.
Bid adieu to our clothing and let the cool sting of the mineral water remind us that we were, in fact, alive and well.
I lost my Patek Philippe in that lake, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.
We seem to have found ourselves alone again, Mr. Rose.
- Moira, that was 15 years ago!
- Mm-hm?
What if someone sees us?
Who knows what will befall us tomorrow, John?
You could be hit by a Mack truck, or bopped on the head by a tiny piece of space debris!
I don't know, it feels risky.
Let me just attend to one thing first.
Moira, whatever it is can wait.
No, no.
Before we re-baptize ourselves I'm going to call my agent and make it official!
Moira Rose is tech un-avail, she has a life to live.
I'm proud of you, Sweetheart.
You just remove those vetements, Mr. Rose, I'll be back in the shake of a lamb's rump.
As soon as I find a signal.
Ugh!
Ugh!
Like   - What's going on over there?
- I'm trying to check in!
If we're going to be late, I'm going to at least do everything I can to not miss my flight, because I have never needed a vacation more.
Yeah, this?
I think this is what might be bothering your brother.
Okay, I get it, my life is an inconvenience.
That.
Um, or the fact that you've been talking nonstop about how desperate you are to get out of here?
I think it might be hurting his feelings.
Okay.
I'm moving to a place that doesn't have a Sephora for literally 2700 miles, so I'm sorry if I'm trying to convince myself that I'm doing the right thing.
I might still be a bit boozy, - Yes, I can confirm that.
- But I've actually been jealous of your trip.
Like, you're getting out there, seeing the world.
And now that Cabaret's over, I feel like I might need to be doing more of that.
I just wish I had your what's going on?
Because I think I might be in the middle of giving you a compliment for the first time, so.
Yes, and I am super touched, it's just that I'm having trouble getting my boarding pass.
Like, do they not let people in economy check in for the flight?
Can I see your phone?
Okay.
Um, think I've found the problem your flight's not leaving for another month.
What?
!
Give me that!
No, it says right here, 0-7-0-8.
Yeah, but it's day before month, so you're not leaving on July 8th, - you're leaving on August 7th.
- What?
Ugh, and my stupid ticket doesn't allow for any changes.
Ugh!
What am I supposed to do?
Well, maybe you could start by telling David that you messed up and he can book the venue after all!
Okay, I would literally rather sleep at the airport - for a month.
- Yeah.
Can you hear me now?
No, I'm not blocking the microphone with my finger anymore!
Okay, no I was.
Now yes?
Oh, well, what would the back end look like on a deal like that?
Oh, I see, what an emphatically Kismetic turn of events.
Oh, John's here now.
Okay, talk soon.
Kisses!
Johnathan, have we found ourselves a new friend?
- Hmm.
- Hello ma'am, I'm Officer Cornwall.
I was off duty when I came across this man in a state of undress, down by the creek.
He claims to be your husband?
Last I checked, a decades-long successful marriage is not a criminal offense.
No, no it is not.
However, indecent exposure certainly is.
I found your husband sunning himself in the creek, like he was in some Grecian bath.
No, I don't think we need to editorialize.
John, I'm so sorry, I was engrossed in a very stirring phone call.
Officer, perhaps we could arrange a plea bargain?
Well, since I wasn't supposed to be fly fishing at this end of the creek, uh I think we can leave it at a warning.
Oh, thank you, Officer, for your almost militant commitment to the protection of our community.
I promise to keep my husband habilimented from now on.
John, you won't believe what's happened!
What happened was, you left me alone, struggling to get out of a creek!
The algae was so slippery, the cop had to throw me his fishing line.
Well, button back up your birthday tux, John, because I've just found out the "Crows" movie is back in business!
- What?
- Yes!
Apparently it's been picked up by Interflex, a brand new streaming service.
Can you believe that?
Moira, you were just saying what a relief it was to have the ups and downs of your career - behind you, and - I know, right?
How serendipitous is this?
At the precise moment I choose to walk away, the industry comes crawling back to me on all fours.
I just worry about the next time it's not great news.
A new day has dawned.
It took my accepting that I could quit at any time to realize I mustnât, John.
Ever.
If this is what you really want, then I'm - I'm happy for you.
- Thank you, John.
It appears officer fly fish has taken his leave, how about that dip?
Oh, I think the moment has passed.
-  - Okay, roadside assistance isn't gonna be here for the next hour, so we're going to call you a cab.
And Clive didn't have jumper cables because he doesn't drive because he's scared of car horns.
Okay, um, David?
I also have something that I would like to say to you as well.
Okay?
I am sorry also, for rubbing my trip in your face.
The truth is, is that I'm really gonna miss you.
Thank you.
I'm going to miss you, as well.
And I just feel so bad about standing in the way - of your dream wedding.
- Oh But maybe I should just, like, - push my trip back by a month.
- Wow.
Okay.
I am not having you push your trip back.
No, I insist.
What's going on?
Nothing, David, just accept your wedding gift.
- Patrick, call a cab, please.
- 'Kay.
Okay, no, don't call a cab!
Ugh.
- My flight got delayed.
- Delayed by a month?
- This is like watching a car crash.
- Ugh.
You mixed up the day and the month on your ticket again, - didn't you?
- No!
I no.
Like that time you showed up to Kate Winslet's wedding - a month late.
- The calligraphy was hard to read and Billy Zane also did the same thing, David.
- Unbelievable.
- Okay, well the upside is that you guys can now take the place, so actually, you're welcome.
She's right, David.
We could go back and talk to Clive.
Do we go back and talk to Clive?
!
-  - Ew.
- Oh my God.
- What is that?
It's like a thousand babies teething.
Didn't he say there was a farm up the road?
Uh, that is correct.
They process their pork on the first Sunday of every month, hence our discounted rates.
Did I hear that the wedding was back on?
Hey.
This is not a winner, Clive.
Okay.
I can't stop hearing it!
It sounded like a thousand Guinea pigs were being shoved into a wood chipper.
- Pork chops?
- Oh, no thank you.
I'll have my later, thanks.
Well, it sounds to me like you two dodged a bacon-wrapped bullet.
I'll say it again life is but a strand of happy accidents.
You've never said that before.
It's such great news about the film, Mrs. Rose.
Interflex is huge.
Oh, wait 'til our movie drops.
So, I just talked to Ted.
He's devastated, obviously, but he did say that it's probably for the best because he still hasn't lizard-proofed his place and I have absolutely no desire to be there until that happens.
You see?
Further proof that life is but a - Okay.
We get it.
- Strand.
Well, I, for one, am happy to have you - for another month, Alexis.
- Thank you.
Hey, what if we got married here?
What if we got married under a highway overpass?
I'm serious.
This place means something to you guys.
Put a tent in the back, string up some lights.
You could make it beautiful.
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.
Oh, in other news your father was arrested for indecent exposure.
- Ew, I'm eating!
- Moira.
Okay.
There's no backing out now!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- What is that?
- What's what?
- S-something spilled.
- What?
- Something spilled in the bed.
- Okay, well, clean it up!
No, it's wet.
There's wet in the bed.
- What?
- Yeah.
Well, what did you spill, David?
- I didn't spill anything!
- Well, what - are you bleeding?
- What?
!
No!
Well, what is it?
Nothing.
- Is it you?
What happened?
- Nothing!
Oh my God, David, did you wet the bed?
No.
I have to go.
- I have to go.
- You're not going anywhere.
No, I need to leave.
David, calm down, okay?
It's fine.
It's not fine!
Nothing about that is fine.
Do we have to file for divorce if we were never married?
We are not getting divorced Yet.
I need to see if I can get the stain out of my sheets first.
Okay, does that window open?
Because I'm about to jump out of it!
David, just get in the shower, I will deal with this.
Just let-let me do that for you.
And I gotta probably get these sheets in the wash sooner than later.
I will take a shower, but we must never see each other again.
Okay, that sounds like a fair deal.
David, I'm gonna need the bedspread too, so Just Okay.
-  - I love you.
I'm glad one of us does!
- Hey.
- Hmm!
So how was your seventh shower?
Satisfactory, thank you so much.
- Listen David, I - Yeah, you know what?
Can we just not?
Well, I think it's important that we do.
- Oh my God!
- Look, things happen.
Yes, things happen!
Things happen all in your sheets, and now you need to remake your little bed, because I peed in it!
David, there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
And look, I found this blanket that I thought I had lost in the laundry room, so you've actually done me a favour.
Mm.
So maybe we can um maybe we can take divorce off the table?
Maybe, but if the tables were turned, - I can't say I'd be as generous.
- Understood.
- What is that noise?
- I don't know.
Maybe the sheets are a bit stiff.
No, it's like a, a crinkling sound.
Oh, you're probably just sitting on the mattress tag.
- Is this a mattress protector?
- No.
No, no, that's a a second sheet that you put on the mattress, um, that my mom gave me when I moved in, so I just You put down a plastic sheet?
Well, I don't think it's a pla I mean, it might have like a rubberized coating, but I don't know.
- Oh my God!
- Purely coincidental.
Purely coincidental?
Okay, look.
I just wanted you to be comfortable in case - it happened again, that's - Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
Come on, David, it's an expensive mattress!
More expensive than my dignity?
- I mean, comparable, at least.
- Wow.
- Wow!
- Okay.
- Well - No good?
Hey, I just got off the phone with the PR people from Interflix, they're making the announcement about the "Crows" movie at noon, so they've requested that you do a social media takeover, but don't worry, I will handle it.
Takeover?
That sounds hostile.
No, they just want you like, send out posts from their account, but I will do it for you.
- You will?
- Mhmm, trust me.
I've dated enough mid-level latte art influencers to know what the people want.
I'm sorry Alexis, I only understood about half of what you just said.
What exactly is required of me?
Um, just like, a couple of cute pics, and funny one-liners.
I see, and you would be the architect behind - those funny one-liners?
- Mhmm.
Color me curious, what might one of my humorous quips sound like to you?
Oh my God, I don't know yet.
Well, it's just that you and I have very different comedic stylings, dear.
I take a slightly more cerebral approach.
Okay, you were the one that described social media as an amusement park for clinical narcissists so, - I'm doing you a favour.
- Very well.
Let me see what you're typing!
"Big news coming soon, caw caw"!
And a little yellow cartoon winking.
You know what would be fun, Alexis, let's put a beak on that winking cartoon.
No, you can't do that.
- Let me handle this, please.
-  Okay, is it on?
Can they see us?
No, you just press "send".
Alexis, this is exciting!
We have our very own digital soapbox here!
It reminds me of the Nickelodeon pilot I did in which Ashley Tisdale and I played suffragettes.
- You remember, "You Go, Girl".
- Mhmm.
- Have you pressed send yet?
- Send.
Okay, great.
Now we just wait three and a half hours, until people are on their lunch break, - and then we post again.
- Okay.
Alexis, they're liking it!
We have five likes!
People are cawing back!
Oh Alexis, I think you and I might need to purchase antibiotics.
I believe we've just gone viral.
Ohhh!
'Kay.
A 20 minute drive to another motel.
Mr. Rose, what are we doing here?
Well, I brought you here, Stevie, because - I think we should buy it.
- Uh.
Yeah, okay.
I'm-I'm not sure about that.
No surprise there, Johnny, I told you she's not the visionary you and I are.
Stevie, this is the inevitable next step in building the Rosebud Empire.
Okay, but I think maybe we should talk about it first, before we just jump into building the empire.
Well, I know this must be a little overwhelming right now, but I thought it was better for you to see the place yourself.
Roland, there are a lot of cars here today.
I thought you set up a private showing.
I'm pretty sure I said private.
Okay, heads up, this must be the agent.
Smile.
Good morning, are you here for Benny Terkstra?
Uh, I spoke with somebody named Betty, but I was mowing the lawn at the time, so your guess is as good as mine.
Betty is Benny's wife.
Please, follow me.
Huh, Betty and Benny?
What are they, puppets?
It's the Benny and Betty Show!
- Okay, Roland - Tu!
Tu!
I'm Betty.
I'm Benny.
I'm Betty!
Why do I get the feeling this isn't an open house?
Maybe it's because of the coffin.
This is a funeral, Roland!
What exactly did the woman say to you?
!
She said the showing was at nine o'clock.
She may have said viewing.
What the hell, Roland?
!
Johnny, language, please!
A man is dead.
David, you know, your tea has been just sitting here untouched for about half an hour, and you're probably gonna have to drink something - at some point.
- I'm just not that thirsty.
I'm doing inventory.
Okay, you're making this so much more - of a thing than it needs to be.
- Am I?
-  - Buongiorno, boys!
Oh ho!
Say hello at all my new hashtag "frands".
It's a little word I assembled to consecrate my fans, who are also my friends.
Okay, "frands" doesn't sound nice.
To all of you asking what is little mercantile establishment with the almost gallery-like austerity?
Well, it so happens it's also owned by my son, David Rose, say hi, David.
Okay, I would rather not, thanks.
And his hashtag fiancee, Patrick.
I don't think you have to say hashtag when you're just talking, Mrs. Rose.
Okay, what are you doing?
You look like the downfall of society.
Can you please turn that off while you're in our store, please?
Very well.
Frands, please keep checking your phones for more "Crow" related Intel by me, Moira Rose, especially you, "Wine and Cat Gal 74," I do hope you stop crying soon.
Caw!
Caw!
For now.
Muah!
Didn't realize you were on social media.
Only fleetingly.
And only because the network requested it.
That's nice.
Hm, it's noticeably cheerless in here today.
If I didn't know better, I would suspect a little trouble in paradise.
David's just having a bit of a day.
Didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
Okay, I'm doing fine, thanks!
David, what's wrong?
Your sleep apnea hasn't returned, has it?
I thought that was remedied when you got your new nose.
- It was.
- Is it night sweats?
You're not eating pepperettes in bed again!
- No.
- Night terrors?
I don't wanna talk about it!
David, don't tell me you've had a nighttime oopsie-daisy.
I'm sorry, a what?
I'm leaving.
Okay?
And if I don't come back it's because of you.
Me?
Ooh dear.
David's nocturnal enuresis used to only happen when he went to bed all juiced up with excited anticipation about something.
Christmas, birthdays, the Ides of March.
And now it seems your impending nuptials - has opened the floodgates.
- Oh!
- Why am I oddly flattered?
- I can't imagine.
Hmm.
Well, I hate to point this out, Mr. Rose, but if you weren't in such a rush to see this place, we wouldn't be at a funeral.
No, it's what happens when you leave anything up to Roland.
We just have to find a window where we can leave without anybody seeing us.
Because the last thing we want to do is offend the woman that's selling us this place.
Well, assuming we're actually buying it.
You know what they say, you can tell the quality of a motel by the food they serve at the owner's funeral.
We're not even supposed to be here, Roland, can you put the plate Is that egg salad?
Betty: Johnny, is it?
- Yes, yes, it is.
- Mrs. Terkstra, this is Johnny Rose.
I-I'm sorry, I don't believe we've met.
Um, how did you know my Benny?
Johnny Yes well, we were uh, friends, I mean acquaintances, I would say - From the bowling league.
- Uh, you mean curling?
Did you curl with my Benny?
I-you know, more important, I think we just wanted to come by - and pay our respects.
- Mhmm.
Because this must be so difficult for you dealing with your loss, and uh selling the motel.
I'm sorry, I'm still trying to place you.
I-I don't remember seeing you at Benny's last bonspiel.
Well, that's because Johnny here um had another bonspiel to go to, and unfortunately that bonspiel was way more important than Benny's bonspiel, so we Well, Ro-Roland that we had to go to that bonspiel.
- No, no, no, that was - I would've been I think I know why you're here.
It might be more appropriate to have this conversation outside.
Since I wasn't in the curling league, can I go home?
No.
No.
Say Havarti, girls!
Oh no!
Well, you can't win them all.
Wow, someone's in a surprisingly good mood, considering they're 15 minutes late.
- Blame my new internet frands.
- What'd she just say?
Oh, I was dragooned into taking over the Interflix social media channels today, and apparently I'm quite proficient at it.
I thought you hated social media.
What did you call it, a um, a cauldron of self-absorption.
You have an almost unsetting memory, Twyla.
Now just a quick snap for my friend, "Wine and Cat Gal 74," and her frands at the rehabilitation facility.
Fine, but nothing gets posted - without my written approval.
-  Oh Alexis, wonderful!
I was just about to post.
Will you please do a selfie of me, and my Jazzagals?
Um, actually, may I speak with you for a moment?
If Interflix is asking if I'll extend my takeover, my answer is, I'll think about it.
-  - Mm, actually, I think we might wanna discuss this matter privately.
Okay, two minutes, gals?
In the meantime, if you'd like to follow the Interflix channels Oh no, that won't be necessary.
Okay, who taught you how to live-stream?
!
A wonderful teen named CherryBus, she lives in Singapore.
Why?
Who wants to know?
Okay, well, did she teach you how to turn it off?
Because you just posted your entire conversation with David and Patrick!
No, I distinctly remember putting down the phone.
But you didn't stop recording.
So people basically got like, a whole podcast about how David's wetting the bed again.
If I wasn't your publicist, I would be enjoying the situation a lot more than I am.
Which is still like, quite a lot.
Oh, dear.
Fortunately, David doesn't subscribe to social media, so we-we just need to take it down, and David will be none the wiser.
- Okay.
- Hey Moira, you weren't lying!
You do have a knack for this.
What are we looking at?
Okay, um, no need to watch that.
Okay, Twyla, if you haven't seen it already, then maybe just once, but that is it!
Now, I-I'd like to start from the beginning.
Mrs. Terkstra, we-we were just - I was speaking.
- Yes, you were.
It's becoming very clear that you people didn't know my husband at all.
Well now, when you say "know" uh - Am I still talking?
!
- Yes, you were, ma'am.
I can't say I wasn't expecting you, I just didn't think you'd show up at the funeral!
I'm aware that my husband was not perfect.
I told him that poker ring was risky, and I know there were some shady business dealings that went on behind closed doors, - but I had nothing to do with it!
- I'm sorry?
Well, you're the federal agents I was warned about.
No need to keep up the act.
Her face has "fed" written all over it.
Thanks Mrs. Terkstra, we're not feds.
No, there seems to have been some crossed wires here.
No, we thought we were coming out to look at the property.
We're from Rosebud Motel.
- Maureen Bud's old place?
- That would be the one.
Uh, Aunt Maureen is was my aunt.
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
Benny and I used to play bingo with Maureen.
-  - What a small world!
Johnny and I used to play bingo with Maureen, - right after curling.
- Roland.
Well, it would be a relief to sell this place to someone we know.
Uh, well, we're not sure yet.
But we can touch base again next week, and again, you have our deepest condolences.
Well, now that you're here, why don't you come on in, - and pay your respects to Benny?
- Oh Considering you may be taking over his home.
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, sure.
We can come in, and pay our respects.
Too bad it's not an open casket.
I would've loved to say goodbye to old Benny's face.
We'd be happy to open it for you.
No, no, closed-closed is fine.
You sure?
Oh look Alexis, Patrick's here.
Yep, you asked me to meet you here.
Hmm.
So what-what-what's goin' on?
And David is bewitching himself elsewhere?
Yeah, he is uh, dusting the shelves, even though I cleaned them last week, but hey, whatever it takes to get him through this.
Priority number one, get David through this!
Mhmm, mhmm!
Quick "Q," um, has David taken your phone, or anything, or like, looked at anyone else's phone?
No.
Sorry, somebody wanna tell me what's goin' on?
Okay, okay so, no biggie, but my mom may have accidentally posted your little conversation from this morning over social media.
The-the one about The oopsie-daisy.
Yes.
But don't worry, I am involved now, and I will be taking it down.
- It's still up?
!
- And generating a lot of traction.
But yes, it's been uh, we're taking it it's being taken down right now.
So how how did this happen?
Right.
I was strong-armed into participating in social marketing, and a dear friend of mine from Singapore, Miss CherryBus, suggested I try my hand at creating a living stream.
Okay, she doesn't know what she's doing, and didn't know that it was recording.
Okay look, David can never, ever find out about this.
I am actually afraid that he will never sleep again.
Precisely why we're involving you in this covert stratagem.
So all we need to do is keep David off the internet for like, 24 hours, or until a celebrity says something wrong, which could be any minute.
Okay, I think I can handle that.
- Wonderful!
Crisis averted.
- Hmm!
Yeah, so you still haven't taken the post down.
- I'm doing that now.
- Cool.
So I'll just sit here until that happens.
- It's kind of cute, though.
- Alexis.
Yes.
- Let's take it down.
- Mhmm.
Oh Stevie, listen, I owe you an apology for today.
You know, the way I rushed you into that thing.
On the plus side, we did make that personal connection, and I think we might be able to get a better deal - than I had thought.
- Okay "we"?
Unless you have a better idea, I know you wanted to talk this out, so uh I'm all ears.
Mr. Rose, what I've been trying to talk to you about is more than just the new motel.
Oh.
Well what is it, Stevie?
I don't think I'm ready to commit to this business like, as a whole.
Oh.
Well, that is a bigger conversation, isn't it?
It's just, doing "Cabaret" made me feel like I should push myself, and so I just wondered you know, maybe there's something more out there for me.
Well, what are you saying, you want out?
No!
Uh, I don't know, I just I feel like I'd regret it if I didn't at least try to see what's out there.
Well, if that's what you feel you need to push yourself, Stevie, I uh certainly am not gonna stand in your way.
Same reason I left the button factory when I was a young man.
That, and the fact that working conditions weren't exactly safe for a ten-year-old, but that being said, I'm not going to pretend that I don't hope you'll come back.
Either way, I hope you find what you're looking for.
Mr. Rose thank you.
Okay, you know what?
I think I should just head home early, - and think about it.
- Yeah or you can think about it as you finish your shift?
That's fair.
I'm gonna miss that enthusiasm.
I'm so glad you decided to stay.
Well, there's literally no liquid left in my body, so.
- Oh!
- Yeah Forgot about this.
Taking that off first thing tomorrow.
Huh!
I wonder how long my mom lasted on the Internets.
Not long, I don't think.
You know, you were smart to get off of there.
Mhmm.
I was curious to see what kinds of things she was posting throughout the day, though.
- Yeah, nothing of note.
- Hmm.
Um yeah, she really didn't know how to use it, so.
- Mhmm.
- Hey, let's talk about something else.
Sure, um what's the thread count on this plastic?
Okay, would it help if I were to share something private and embarrassing with you?
I might be too tired for that tonight.
Ha ha!
If we're gonna be married, I just think it's important that we be as open and honest with each other as we possibly can.
What is this sexy thing?
Okay, I only put this in when you're not around.
- It's my mouth-guard.
- Oh well, there's nothing really embarrassing about that.
Also, you look very beautiful.
Aw, thank you.
Um, hmm.
- How about now?
- My God!
This is my nose thing, and it just helps me breathe better.
I have never been more attracted to you.
Mm, same.
-  -  Ooh!
Ronnie's texting me a link to something?
Okay, put it away, David.
It's bedtime.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1  I-I can see you!
Can you see me?
Finally!
How many days has it been?
Yeah, sorry about that.
We ended up having to extend our research trip.
But it was totally worth it because we discovered a new breed of fly that mates with itself.
Yummm!
Mm.
Well, I guess if this is what you look like after finding some gross fly, I can forgive you for being away for so long.
I've actually been bench pressing 100-pound tortoises because there's no gym here.
Ted!
Stop making me jealous of turtles.
Tortoises, but I do have tur-tell you that I've been thinking about you, a lot, especially at nighttime.
What a coincidence.
I've been thinking about you a lot.
At nighttime.
- I've been all alone and lonely.
-  -  - Oh!
Oh my God, David!
Knock much?
!
-  - Ted: Hi, David!
Hi.
Is he dressed?
- Yes!
- Ugh.
Forget it.
Okay, we're celebrating our anniversary.
Can you give us some privacy, please?
Kids, just wanna let you know I'm taking the car this morning.
- Ugh!
- Mm.
You might wanna say hi to Ted.
He and Alexis were about to engage in cyber-sex.
Mm!
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mr. Rose.
Moira: Alexis, what have I told you about putting your body on the internet?
Never!
Never without proper lighting.
Can everyone get out, please?
!
I haven't seen my boyfriend in like eight days.
And I haven't seen my furry Fendi's for weeks.
- Hi, Mrs. Rose!
- No.
We're not engaging with them.
Everybody out so I can finish off with Ted!
- Sick!
- Ugh!
Goodbye, please!
Found them!
What took you so long?
Uh, you said it was an emergency, so I came straight here.
You stopped for coffee?
And a breakfast burrito that I got to go.
So what's going on?
I need you to help me put together an outfit.
'Kay, I have a job interview this afternoon and I need to look professional.
So, does that mean you're officially leaving the motel?
No.
just, I don't know, I'm just, you know, trying to see what's out there.
- Mm.
- And Larry Air is hosting an open call for employment opportunities.
Okay, "Larrierre" sounds like a dollar-store perfume.
It's an airline.
Larry is the name of the CEO.
He used to own a chain of delis, but then he sold them - to buy a bunch of planes.
- Mm.
I get to travel, see the world.
Mhmm.
You know that I was once told that I would make an excellent flight attendant.
Hmm!
By who?
Sandy, the hostess on our private plane.
She once let me de-bone a branzino - during turbulence.
- So what're you trying to say?
You don't think I have what it takes to be a flight attendant?
No.
I just think if it's between the two of us, we all know who's getting the job.
Oh!
Okay.
Why don't you come with me then and and we'll see who gets it.
Well, if this is what we're working with, I think we can hand me the contract today.
I need a boot.
Johnny: I think the pitch for the new motel went well.
If all goes to plan, we should be able to move forward even without Stevie.
I want you to know, Johnny, I am not gonna abandon you like she did.
- Stevie didn't abandon us.
- Well, jump ship.
Look, origami!
All right, gentlemen, I spoke with my manager and everyone's in agreement that this proposal is excellent.
Ah!
That sounds good!
Unfortunately, we couldn't offer the loan at this time.
Sorry, I might've gotten confused there.
The bank has assessed that you don't have enough assets to secure the loan.
I have assets.
I'm invested in the motel.
Which doesn't appear to be in your name.
That's right, it's in my partner's name.
So, you're Stevie Budd?
No.
Believe it or not, that's actually a woman's name.
Look, there must be something we can do here.
I ran a major business for 30 years.
Yeah, and look at the way this guy bounced back from total financial ruin.
You know, there was a day when banks would provide loans based solely on their faith in a very solid business idea.
That's gonna be a tough sell to my boss.
We don't offer faith-based loans.
Okay, uh, I did not wanna play this card, but I will.
- I am the mayor.
- You already mentioned that.
'Kay, did I mention I went steady with your mom?
Unfortunately, you did.
Okay, then I'm out.
I got nothing.
Honey, you're home!
- Yay!
-  Alexis!
Your father and I are going to meet for a celebratory lunch when he's done at the bank, and I was supposed to invite you to join us.
Yeah, I'm a little busy.
What in God's name do you have there?
Please tell me it's not a testudine.
No, it's a turtle.
Alexis!
Turtles do not pets make.
The poor things are riddled with a myriad of diseases.
You may as well tie a leash around a raw chicken cutlet.
Relax, they said he's already been washed.
Say hello to Ted.
Hello, Theodore.
I don't see the computer.
No, I've named the turtle Ted.
All the blogs about successful long-term relationships say that the key is creating shared experiences.
Oh dear.
If your coupling is too frangible to survive this brief disunion Okay, I am trying my best.
Is this supposed to be making me feel better?
Oh, very well.
Alexis, if you desire a love with longevity, the key is to have as little in common as possible.
After an award-worthy trilogy of decades together, your father and I still astonish each other.
Although today, I will but feign surprise when he tells me he's secured a hefty loan to initiate our imminent connecting departure from this lengthy layover.
You'll be coming with?
No.
I have to give Ted his pellets, and then put him down for a little nap.
Sexy.
Mm!
Mm!
Now is this look comfortable for you, or uncomfortable?
Uh, you dress for the job you want.
So you wanna be a youth pastor?
Hi.
Wow.
While, that joke was surprisingly sharp, these are Patrick's clothes.
So, you might wanna tell that to my fiancÃ©'s face.
Mm.
"Larry Air, recent improvements: all chairs will have tray tables, not just first class".
I feel like I'm flying on the Concorde.
You can leave any time.
I'm fine to do this on my own.
How will I get the job if I leave now though?
All right, everyone, If you could please follow me, we're ready to get started.
Thank you so much.
Well, it is so exciting to see how much interest there is in Larry Air.
Oh, I should mention, if anyone here is involved in the class-action lawsuit against Larry Air, you are disqualified from applying.
All right, why don't we go around, and I'll have each of you state your name and tell us what you consider your biggest weakness.
Ooh!
Me?
Um Stevie Budd, and um I'd say my biggest weakness is - that I'm disorganized.
- Ooh, that's true.
- And, um, I'm indecisive.
- Yes.
- Uh I also - Okay.
We just needed one.
Next?
Hi.
David Rose.
Would we consider loyalty a weakness?
If not, I'm also really honest.
I'm just gonna put down chatty.
- Okay.
- Hmph.
Well, she said there was nothing she could do.
Apparently, I don't have enough assets.
Yeah, she said apparently Johnny doesn't have enough assets.
Yeah, and the problem is, how do you get assets - without the loan?
- But the the problem is, how do you get assets without a loan?
Roland, you're not adding anything to the sentence, you're just repeating what I said.
Anyway, I don't know how long this will set us back, Moira.
Could be another year or two before we make any headway.
Oh, surely there's some penny-wise townsperson with a hidden rainy-day reservoir.
Well, you know, uh, I don't wanna be the town gossip here, but, uh, the other day, I got a look at Bob's financial statement on his desk in the office, and that garage is doing great!
Plus, he got plugs last year, but you didn't hear that from me.
You know, come to think of it, Gwen has been coming to rehearsal in those fancy yoga clothes.
Those are not cheap.
I know because I buy the knockoffs, - and they're not cheap.
- Bob You know, he was very interested in that bagel business a while ago, and this is a much stronger idea.
Roland and I are having dinner with Bob and Gwen tonight.
- Bob!
- Hey, folks.
Bob!
Oh, look at you, Robert, with the hides of a herd of Holstein on your back.
Yeah.
Sorry, uh, I don't have time to chat.
Uh I just had two cups of coffee, uh, I don't wanna push my luck.
I mean, uh, these pants, they take like a year to unlace, so  Rose's, I hope you like fish, 'cause I think we just reeled in a big one.
Hey, Alexis.
Another green smoothie, no greens?
Um yeah, if you're making one.
No.
I'm asking if you want one.
Okay, Twy, I didn't like leave anything behind when I popped by earlier, did I?
I don't think so, but if you tell me what you lost, I can ask George if anyone turned it in?
No, it's, it's nothing.
It's just a turtle.
- What?
- His name is Ted and he's gone.
And I can't remember where I put him, and I thought it was in the motel, but he could've like crawled out of my purse when I brought him by the cafe earlier.
Okay.
Turtles are actually kind of like huge health hazards, so when did you last see him?
'Kay, it's been weeks.
But between the patchy Wi-Fi and like the ten-day nature trips, and me being alone here, kind of feels like he left the day that he flew to the Galapagos.
The turtle flew to the Galapagos?
No, Ted the turtle is missing, I am now talking about my boyfriend Ted, Twy.
It'd be great if you could keep up.
Right.
Sorry.
The slowest animal on earth escaped from me.
That can't not be a bad sign.
My mom had a turtle dove that was eaten by her ex-fiancÃ©'s snake.
- That was a bad sign.
- Oh my God.
And it happened on Valentine's Day.
- Mm.
- And her fiancÃ© was a Satanist.
I think you guys are just going through a tough time.
But who knows?
Maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much closer this brings the two of you.
And if it makes you feel any better, turtles actually thrive out of captivity.
Thanks, Twy.
Oh, and if you do see Ted like waddling around in the kitchen, just feed him a carrot and shoot me a text.
I hope you're joking.
Me too, girl.
Love you!
- Excuse me.
- Mm?
This baby behind me has been crying for over an hour now and I just can't take it anymore.
You and me both.
I have shushed them thrice at this point.
Now, here are your options: I could either move those two to the back of the plane, or I could offer you some complimentary alcohol to make your flight a little more bearable.
Okay.
Thank you, David.
Thank you, Carol!
- That was a great example - Thank you!
Of what not to do.
David just reminded us of two touchstone policies here at Larry Air: no seat changes, and "complimentary" is not in our corporate vocabulary.
But finger snaps for David!
- All:  - We don't s-Sure.
Okay, I think it's time to move on to the final round.
If I call your name, please stand up.
Rupinder Pimms, Tracey Mickleson, Felix Ng, and David Rose.
- Fuck yes!
- I regret to inform you, you will not be asked to continue the process.
-  - This is so embarrassing.
I thought you said David Rose.
I did.
Too bad they didn't have a branzino to de-bone - because you would've got this.
-  Hmm Yeah, hi, Carol?
Uh, it's just that some of us drove some of the other applicants here, so it might just be easier if we all just moved forward into the next round.
I think it's best if you wait in the hall.
Okay.
I'll be taking some of these complimentary peanuts then.
Oh, as I pointed out, nothing is complimentary on Larry Air.
I'm taking the peanuts, Carol!
-  - Okay, moving on  Well, hopefully, Gwen will be here soon.
Oh, we don't have to wait for Gwen.
Oh, I think we do.
It uh gives us more time to talk.
How often do good friends get a chance to sit around and, uh, and talk?
Right!
And, you know, I didn't get a chance to tell you before, but that is one snazzy outfit.
I mean Somebody somebody's got some money to burn.
Take it easy, Roland.
- Well - Let's not embarrass the man.
He obviously knows what his money can do for him.
This is so exciting!
I feel like I'm a Wolf of Wall Street.
Good then let's go get our lamb.
Oh, are we having lamb?
No, just my Sloppy Jocelyns.
Hope you're hungry, Bob.
Speaking of yummy opportunities.
John, were you able to return Bill and Melinda's call today about the hmm hmm-hmm?
Well, you know, Moira, we're not supposed to be discussing investment opportunities at the table, no matter how lucrative they might be.
But you know what the Gateses are like - Bill and Melinda.
You know, they're expecting your call about  the investment.
- Yeah.
- Wow!
You know Bill Gates?
Oh, who doesn't?
But you're right, Bob, why gild their lilies when there might be someone right under our noses looking for a lucrative venture?
Well, I look, I I might as well just come clean: Gwen's not coming.
Let's eat.
Yeah, she, uh, she left me.
I'm sorry, it's just all this, all this money talk, and all I can think about is how much I spent on this suit.
Gwen, she told me, you know, she said, "I like bad boys," and now she's holed up with our minister.
She was bragging about a religious experience.
Perhaps there's an upside to all this, - fiscally speaking.
- Hmm!
Oh no, no.
Listen, uh, Johnny, I, I hate to ask, but, uh, you just seem to have so many, uh, high-profile friends.
Do you think one of them might be open to cutting me a loan?
See, Gwen and Parson Jim, they're they're after the house.
Mm.
So, are you just never gonna talk to me ever again?
I asked you to roll up the window in the car.
The highway smelled like manure.
Okay.
It just seems like you're upset.
Not upset.
Just didn't feel like talking in the car.
So.
Okay.
Did Carol embarrass herself by sending me away in front of everybody?
Absolutely.
Was the entire group shocked by that decision?
Seemed like it based on some people's faces.
Now ask me if I care.
- Do you care - Don't care!
I don't care!
You are such a sore loser.
- I am not!
-  I'm not.
It's just, do you really wanna work for a place that clearly doesn't know what they're doing?
Oh, well, they really want me to work for them, so I have to trust that they do know what they're doing.
- Okay.
- Admit it.
I'm more qualified than you.
- Fine.
- Admit it.
You're more qualified than me.
- Thank you!
- Now let's see what exciting new job opportunities await you in your new career as an airline hostess.
Give me that!
Give it!
I am so embarrassed for you!
Now, I would love to use one of Larry Air's "completely private" new paid toilets.
I don't know why they have to stress "completely private".
Get out!
Get out!
-  - No.
Ugh!
Alexis: Ted!
Dinner's ready!
Ugh!
- Alexis Rose?
- Yes?
Mr. Mullens has arranged a limo for you.
If you could please come with me.
How do I know this isn't like an abduction or something?
It's not an abduction.
You didn't blink.
I believe you.
Um, okay, I'll be out in five.
Good evening, Ms. Rose.
The other member of your party has already been seated.
I tell myself that I'm So lucky To be loving you Oh, hi.
Ted!
What is this?
Well, I couldn't let our anniversary go without a celebration.
Just because we're not in the same city doesn't mean that we can't go on a date.
And you're wearing the little tie with your short-sleeved shirt.
My little Galapo-guy.
Yeah, it's actually really hot here, so the bottom half is just my bathing suit and flip-flops.
Ted!
More about your bottom half, please!
Twyla's not standing right behind you, is she?
Hi, Ted.
Twyla, again, I can't thank you enough for making this happen.
Um, I can lock up if you wanna go, Twy.
Oh, someone has to serve you dinner.
But don't worry, I'll stay out of your way.
Alexis, I'm sorry for dropping the ball on our calls.
I thought that we would have Wi-Fi on the trip and we didn't, so the rest of the team just had to listen to me talk about you for seven days.
In fact, they actually named the new fly "Alexis".
The fly that mates with itself?
Yeah, I think the important thing is that, now, I have a little Alexis here with me, just buzzing around.
I'm just like so happy to see your face.
Me too.
So lucky Boop!
Boop!
To be loving you   Okay, John, I'm going to throw another name at you: Ronnie.
Owns her own business, no kids.
Clearly doesn't spend any money on herself.
I appreciate the enthusiasm, Moira, but uh I just got off the phone with Betty Terkstra.
She sold the place.
No, John!
I'll keep an eye open for a less pricey property, but, uh, without Stevie, I think we're in a bit of a bind.
Oh, John, hold me.
Good is coming, it has to.
Hello, Johnny!
Look, I appreciate the gesture, guys, but, uh, this is not a good night for champagne.
Oh, speak for yourself, John.
Oh good, you're lying down!
We have big news.
If you're referring to the bath-time video Gwen posted N-no, n-no, it's it's not that exciting.
No, um  well, we - brought the motel!
- What?
!
Yeah, we took out a second mortgage on our house.
Yeah.
After what went down at dinner, Joc and I started talking, and we figured, well, if it's good enough for Bill Gates to invest in, it's, uh, good enough for us to invest in.
Roland, we don't actually know I'm, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm not comprehending.
We are buying into the business.
Say hello to your new business partners.
Oh, well, if that's not cause for alcohol I don't know what is.
So, we have the motel?
We sure do.
Now, first order of business, we need name tags.
I don't believe this!
Roland, we will make this work.
- Yes.
- We'll make it work.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Roland.
- All right.
- Why is there a turtle on the floor?
- Moira: Alexis!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Oh my God, I just sent you the first trailer to the "Crows" movie!
- What?
!
- My "Crows" movie?
No.
Gwen's.
They sent over a little sneak peak before it goes live tomorrow.
Oh, Alexis!
This is a critical moment.
A siren call to the cinematic rapture that is to come.
- How did it look?
- It like literally just came through John, draw the curtains.
- David!
- David: What?
We're going to watch the "Crows" trailer.
No!
No, go away.
Perhaps I should screen it privately first.
Okay.
Well, I'm here now.
So the least you could do is show me it.
-  - Dad!
John, it's practically obsidian in here!
You just said close the curtains!
Okay.
Okay, family, be kind.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Okay, we gotta press play.
- Oh.
Okay.
Ad voice: Some banks make mortgages way too complicated.
I don't remember any of this ?
- Oh, it's just an ad, Sweetheart.
- Skip it.
Trailer voice: There was a time when the Crows were our friend - It's halted.
Someone hit resume.
- Just let it buffer.
- Friends.
- Well, we best be returning Dad, I told you we needed to upgrade the Wi-Fi.
Oh, this is a no way an optimal viewing experience.
- It's back!
- Okay, start it over.
Okay.
Ad Voice: Some banks make mortgages - You know what, this is excruciating.
- You know what, Sweetheart?
Why don't you just give us a holler when it's ready?
Oh my God, David!
I totally forgot about the wedding dream book!
Um, where did you find that?
Um, I was looking for an earring and found it under your pillow.
Anyway, you did it.
You manifested your wedding and I'm like literally stunned.
You're stunned.
Yeah, but like in a good way.
Like think of all the people on the planet who find someone, somehow you're one of those people.
I don't know how to take that.
I mean, you didn't end up marrying JC Chasez or Jenna Elfman.
But I actually feel like Patrick is kind of - the best of both of them.
- Mhmm.
Oh, so you're still gonna do Keira Knightley's green dress from Atonement as my maid of honor look?
You know what, haven't got to that stage in the planning process yet.
So I'm not quite sure.
Okay.
Well, I'm here for a month so you better put me to work while your can.
-  - Hm.
Come in.
Well, if it isn't our very own little JC Chasez.
- Sorry.
Who?
- Ooh, we've been over that.
Um, we should probably go though.
Oh.
Where are my favourite groom and David off to?
We are taking Patrick to get his suit fitted.
What kind of suit?
- Hopefully my wedding suit.
- Oh my God.
Well, I'll just grab my bag, and come with.
You know what, I don't even know if that's necessary.
Honestly, David, it's fine.
I'm your maid of honor.
Um hmm Okay re: that.
You weren't supposed to be here for six months, so I might have asked someone else.
Okay.
Well, I'm here now.
So who did you ask?
If you say Ronnie Oh, I don't think she would have said say yes.
- Does not like him.
- Yeah.
Um, I asked Stevie.
David, you better be talking about Stevie Nicks.
Stevie said yes?
I mean, it was more of a reluctant "sure".
Okay, well, it sound like she doesn't actually wanna do it.
So why don't I just come with, and I will gently take it off her hands.
Fine.
But I don't want any hurt feelings.
Because the last thing we need right now is interpersonal conflict eclipsing my our day.
Imagine what I could do with you bachelor party, David.
Diplo still sends me nudes.
- It's a DJ.
- Okay.
Oh Roland, I'm shocked.
These rooms are in good shape.
Well, I don't know what you were expecting, Johnny.
I mean, no offense, but I don't throw good money down on lemons.
Who am I, you buying your car?
Okay, we've had no problems with the car, Roland.
No, this place has good bones.
Oh, look the maid forgot to pick up her tip.
Is that a bag full of money?
Yeah, it's kinda a generous tip when you consider she didn't clean up this garbage and this loaded gun.
All right.
Don't point it, put it down.
Put the gun down.
Someone's clearly been squatting here.
And by the looks of it, they don't appear to be on the up and up.
Well, maybe Benny and Betty left this here.
And we just inherited a bag of money and a gun.
If we're gonna split it up, I call the money.
We're not taking the money, Roland.
Whoever left it here is obviously coming back for it.
Why do you say that?
I left a pack of chewing gum at the movie theater two weeks ago, and I haven't gone back for it.
Look at this, a cigarette and a newspaper.
That stuff could've been here for years.
Then explain why the coffee is still hot?
- It's called global warming, Johnny.
- Okay.
Why do you strike me as one of those people that doesn't believe in that.
Roland, I say we go to the police.
We have to let them handle it.
And then what?
We offer our guests a discount to stay in the middle of a crime scene.
Then what do you suggest?
Let's stake out the place, Person comes back, takes their stuff, leaves, and we can change the locks.
Okay, we give it a day, see if the guy comes back.
Or gal.
This is the 21st century, Johnny.
- Okay.
- Let's get with it.
Come on.
- I'm with it.
-   Well, we best be returning to the lab, Nathaniel.
It's getting  dark.
But it's the middle of the afternoon, must be a solar eclipse.
That's not an eclipse, Nathaniel!
Those are birds!
-  - Ahhh!
And so  what have we done?
!
Trailer voice: "The Crows Have Eyes: The Crowening".
Mrs. Rose, was that you the whole time?
Indeed it was.
Thanks in large part to the thaumaturgy of our special effects department.
Stunning, isn't it?
What a human beak can do?
So wait.
Did you get the virus in the end?
Was that not clear?
Should we give it another watch?
No, I think three times through is the sweet spot.
This is so exciting.
What if it gets nominated for an Oscar?
Twyla!
No, we must keep the carriage in the wake of the mare.
Golden Globe, perhaps, but I won't let myself envisage that.
I gotta say, those special effects looked way better than what I pictured when you described it.
Credit the technical wizardry of our team of imaginators.
Gals, we're being rude.
Jocelyn hasn't had a chance to render her opinion, though the adulation does appear to be unanimous.
Well it looked just like a real movie.
Now there is the quote for the sizzle reel!
Oh it's-it's neat!
"Neat".
To see you in a in a real movie.
Anyways, I bet we are dying to get to rehearsal, ladies.
So let's get those stands.
Of course.
We'll pick up this parley after rehearsal.
- Were the crows nice?
- Hm.
My uncle had a parrot that just kept asking me to take my bra off.
Okay, so you guys just chat up here, and I'll keep it cool, keep it casual.
Okay.
Here she comes.
She'll probably gonna be uncomfortable admitting that she doesn't wanna be a part of your wedding party, so I'm gonna make her feel like she's doing me a favour.
- Patrick: Isn't she though?
- Alexis: Okay.
That's funny.
More of that.
But aim it at David.
-  - Please drive.
- Like, now.
- Yep.
So that's your uniform, huh?
You do know that "Pan Am" was canceled after a season, right?
Cool and casual, please David.
I am sitting next to her so I will be the one to handle this.
This is the flight attendant's uniform.
Why am I wearing it, you ask?
Because this morning I found out I was gonna be a flight attendant on a real flight.
Wait, didn't you like just start?
Uh, less than a week ago?
Yeah.
Mhmm.
So how safe can the plane be if I'm the one in charge of saving people's lives?
Yeah.
Yikes.
Not safe.
So you probably just wanna like head home then.
I'm fine.
As long as I don't have to go back there.
I was gonna put my life in danger for what?
To see the world?
They only fly to Hoboken, Windsor and South Dakota.
I've actually heard South Dakota is quite scenic.
- Okay.
- Did you know that Larry Air has 18 ongoing lawsuits?
- One of which is from Larry himself.
- Wow, okay.
Got it.
I left a job that I actually liked for this.
What is wrong with me?
How honest do you want us to be?
Oh no, babe.
It sounds like you have so much on your plate already, on top of your bridesmaids duties.
Are you sure you want that much stress?
As crazy as this sounds, I'm actually looking forward to that.
Feel like it's the only job I can't mess up at this point.
Totally.
Hmm.
Okay, Johnny.
As soon as we get this place up and running the first order of business is to restock the vending machine.
Do you know that all they had was this Drink Tyme Orange Sodas and one bag of Poly Puffs.
All right, we're gonna have to get some brand names in there.
No, I'm saying get more of this.
Do you realize that this soda is made with 99% real drink.
You can't argue with that kind of math.
Roland, can you focus on the task at hand please?
If we're gonna be partners, you've gotta take this job more seriously.
Well, why do you think I got these snacks?
I mean we could be on this stakeout for days, maybe weeks.
-  - Someone's coming.
Get down.
It is a man.
Your sexist instincts were right as usual.
Okay.
Good, good, good.
Maybe he'll just get his stuff and leave.
He's taken off his jacket.
He's going to the vending machine?
Roland, we can't have squatters here.
One of us is gonna have to talk to him.
Johnny, the guy has a gun.
Okay, then as partners, I think it's only fair thing to do is handle this together.
Okay.
I just need a minute to figure out what I'm gonna say.
-  - Come in.
Oh, good, Jocelyn, I caught you in a moment of repose.
Yeah.
I was just grading book reports.
Heh.
Tell me about it!
So how are you doing, Jocelyn?
You seem to be wishing to discharge something from your chest today at rehearsal and didn't get a chance.
- Uh, no, I'm fine.
- You're fine.
Why?
Why do you hate my movie?
- I just saw the trailer.
- Exactly!
Yet you've already deemed it this year's John Carter.
- I never said that.
- You didn't have to.
Just the look in your eyes sent a chilling, wet gust of raspberries to my face.
I just don't like horror movies.
My first boyfriend took me to a Michael Meyers movie and I never got over it.
Not "The Love Guru"?
Moira, you don't really care if I like your movie?
Don't be giddy.
But just so you know, Jocelyn, an actress is only as happy as her unhappiest audience.
What do we think?
Bow tie or no bow tie.
- Oh, bow.
- No bow.
I sort of feel like bow tie is kind of classic, no?
Okay, you sort of made it seem like you weren't sure.
I'm not sure.
But I also very much am.
Also, a black bow ties photograph better.
I should know.
I once hooked up with three different GQ Men of the Year.
At the GQ Men of the Year party.
Okay, sorry.
I'm probably not the person to ask for fashion stuff.
Um, speaking of maid of honor duties Stevie?
Thoughts on the bachelor party.
Oh-oh.
Um, I think I was just gonna see what David wanted to do?
Okay.
I'm super easy.
Although I did find a gorgeous ryokan in Hakone With a hot spring-fed onsen on the balcony?
Private Chef optional.
But I'm open to other ideas.
Okay.
Hot tip: it often makes for less stress if you just plan it yourself and then tell the bride after.
Okay.
Stevie, not hot on that tip.
Okay?
Okay, I'm starting to realize that there's a lot more to this job than I thought.
Tell me about it.
I once planned Megan Fox's bachelorette on this tiny island off the coast of Montenegro where nothing is illegal.
Like nothing.
Okay.
Are you sure you shouldn't do this?
Because, I mean you're here now, you're David's sister, and you're clearly better suited for the job.
Oh my God, Stevie.
I get why you and everyone else would be asking that question, but the answer is like maybe?
What am I doing?
Well, we can just crossfade responsibilities.
No.
What am I doing with my life.
I'm now unemployed in my thirties.
For the second time in a week.
I left your dad high and dry at the motel and now I'm  Okay, all of what you're saying may be very, very true.
Which is why I will not let you give up this job.
You can do this.
And if you can't, I will be here for the whole month to help you through it.
Bring it in, girl.
Oh no, I don't think you need to okay.
-  -  Hey, what do we think about this one?
Oh my God.
Since when did James Bond shop to Elm Glenn?
- So that's a yes?
- Yes.
Um, we still need to pick a tie.
So what does our maid of honor think?
Hm.
Hm.
Which one is your favourite.
Hm Yes.
Can we just get married already?
I'm kidding, I want pageantry that takes months and months to plan.
- Of course you do.
- You look so good.
Fits in the shoulders.
Make you button it up.
Thank you.
Okay.
Oh, I really don't know about this, Roland.
Still feels like a police matter to me.
Johnny, you got this.
Relax.
Remember there is two of us, one of him so.
- Okay.
-  Of course he does have that gun.
- Yeah?
- Hi.
My name is Johnny Rose and this is my partner Partner.
He calls me No we actually just met.
What're you, guys, cops?
No.
No, no.
No weapons here.
No, we're um, we're the new owners of this motel and we just stopped by and say hi, and to get a little more information about what exactly you are doing here on our property.
And by the way, whatever you're doing is A-okay with me.
But unfortunately Professor Prude here is not too keen on "squatters".
Who said I'm a squatter?
I'm a long-term tenant.
Betty told me she'd bake that into the contract.
Bake it into the contract.
Roland?
Was it in the contract?
The contract is like 25 pages.
- That's what lawyers are for.
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
And I assure you that it's in there.
You're a lawyer?
Then might I ask what you're doing here?
I'm a prosecutor.
And uh, when you're putting away the kind of guys I do - Or gals.
- No, never women.
It's always safest to keep a low profile.
So part of that involved paying Betty and Benny in cash.
Okay.
Well, that explains what that big ole bag was for.
- How do you know I have a big old bag?
- I didn't know.
I don't know anything about a bag.
You guys have been in my room, haven't you?
You know I keep a lot of very highly classified - documents in here.
- Uh, no, it wasn't us.
No.
But we will make sure no one ever pokes around - in here again.
- Right.
We wouldn't want you to have to use your gun.
You found my gun?
I don't know what he's talking about.
Obviously you're a valued guest here.
So here's my card, and we can set up the same cash payments that you gave to Betty.
Have a very pleasant stay.
Well, Johnny, you still wanna call the cops?
Okay, you were right on this one, Roland.
I think this was a pretty important one to be right on.
Our first guest, not bad, huh?
- Not bad.
- Okay.
How about "Good job, Roland".
- Good job, Roland.
- You're a professional, Roland.
Dr. Clara Mandrake: What have we done?
!
Good.
Good.
And the egg-laying feels grounded.
-  - Hi Moira, I don't wanna interrupt you, I can see you're busy watching the trailer again.
I just wanted to apologize for earlier.
No need to self-flagellate, Jocelyn.
Even if yours is the lone dissenting voice in the canticle.
Sorry, Moira, I think my reason for not wanting to jump on the bandwagon is just that I've seen you get your hopes up before, only to be disappointed when things didn't work out.
I don't require coddling.
I know.
Now that I realize that my opinion means something to you, there is a lot that I liked about the trailer Do go on.
"From the first ominous syllable of the narrator's tale, one can feel the hair on one's arms standing at affrighted attention.
Yes, there will be blood.
And, yes, you will be horror-struck.
But, more than that, you will be lured, against every instinct for self-preservation, to look inside, and face your very own futile resistance to transfiguration".
- Who wrote that?
- I did.
You?
You did.
Oh, wow Jocelyn, thank you.
Nothing about me or my performance?
Oh.
It's just a first draft.
Yes.
Okay.
- I really liked your feathers!
- Mhmm.
They're very life-like.
Surprise.
They are real.
1200 of them hand-sewn into my costume.
Mhmm.
The live crows on set welcomed me as their own.
One even tried to mate.
- Ooh.
Sounds dangerous.
-  Wow.
Perhaps one more watch to get your superlatives surging anew?
Oh Moira, I'm sure that you're tired and okay.
Trailer Voice: "There was a time when the Crows were our friends".
- That voice really is creepy.
- Shh.
Wow, so what happened?
She was ready to hand over the crown.
Oh, she was, but I feel like she needs it more than I do.
Wow.
Who are you?
I know, right?
Like what's happening to me?
- You're going soft.
- Ugh.
But don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
Anyway, it might kill me on the day, but I'm glad that she actually found something - to distract herself.
- Hm.
Mhmm.
Speaking of the day I have a better job for you?
Okay.
I think it would be a weird look for me to be a flower girl at my age, David.
I've thought about it and I want you to give me away.
Oh my God, David.
That's like arguably the most important role of the wedding.
A simple yes or no is fine.
No need to pull focus.
Okay.
I do.
Great.
Although now that I think about it, I could also be the flower girl.
Like come out first, wearing a gown made entirely of flowers - No.
- Just walk down the aisle, - and loop back - Absolutely not.
And then quick outfit change, and we're up.
I take it back, I'm gonna ask Jocelyn.
- Hm.
Hey - Enough.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1   As your publicist, it is my job to optimize a branded approach to real-time engagement with your fan-base through contextual marketing.
I hope I'm not paying you by the word.
Which is why I came up with the ideation for the following idea.
"Crows".
"Movie".
- "Premiere"?
!
- They're doing a premiere?
I thought it was streaming on Interflix?
Where are they thinking?
LA?
New York?
London might be central for the Bosnian team.
No, they're not doing a premiere.
Alexis, your flip-chart says "premiere".
Okay, will you let me finish what I'm trying say?
What're you trying to say?
I'm sorry, why are you even involved in this conversation?
-  What is it, Alexis?
!
- Oh my God, okay!
So I thought because they're not throwing a premiere, we could plan a premiere screening here in town.
Could be like a cute press angle.
Oh, sure, for a scrappy little novice, but not for someone who's cut many a crimson rug.
What's next, I sign my name in the pavement outside Bob's Garage?
Jocelyn gives you an honorary degree at her school?
- Host the Met Ga-la at David's store?
- I don't like that one.
No, I have like big plans for an immersive experience.
Ronnie said that she can find a red carpet, and Roland has a guy who rents out live crows.
I think we should take the lead from Interflix.
I cannot stop the masses from gathering to view the film, but best best to avoid any fulsome in-decorum until we're assured a positive reaction.
Remember that "Waterworld II" premiere?
Exactly, David.
Oh, the last place anyone wanted to be when those reviews came in was a glass-bottomed pirate ship - in the middle of the ocean.
- Mm.
- Good luck though.
- Lick rust!
Thank you!
Can't thank you enough for driving today, Stevie.
I don't know what is going on with my car.
I do.
It's a death trap that needs to be set on fire and pushed off a cliff.
Well, I'd love to say I had a choice in the matter, but according to David, driving his fiancÃ© to go get his wisdom teeth out is totally within my maid-of honor responsibilities.
Okay, tell me how I'm being unreasonable?
Also, if this is what it takes to get you out of that dank little apartment Excuse me, I have a business meeting this afternoon.
Just gonna leave it at that?
Mr. Rose asked if he could come over to my place.
I think he's gonna push for me to come back, and I don't know if I can say no.
And that's a bad thing?
I'm supposed to be looking for other jobs.
Okay.
Honestly, Stevie, what other job is better than owning your own business?
I guess I just feel like after making such a big deal out of wanting to see what else is out there, isn't it kind of pathetic to like crawl back?
Don't answer that.
I already turned down another job interview today.
Maybe you just needed to see what you didn't want in order to figure out what you do?
Look at me.
Two years ago, I thought I'd have a wife and kid at this point.
Yeah, well, one out of two isn't bad.
I've been told I'm very young at heart.
Can you drive better, please?
- Hi.
- Uh-oh!
Hello, Access Hollywood?
Have I got a star sighting for you!
Very pawky, Jocelyn.
I just heard the big news.
A movie premiere in our own backyard!
I might have to buy a dress!
Uh save yourselves the trip to Frocks4Less.
From what I've heard, it's more of a minor league viewing party.
Well, I'm still excited.
It reminds me of that time that RenÃ©e Zellweger's brother came in here, and I got him to sign a menu.
I mean, he spelled his name differently, but I swear it was him.
Well, I don't know, Moira, I'm no movie expert, but according to the early reviews, you may have a hit on your hands.
- Reviews?
- Yeah.
There was an article posted on the Crows account that you made us all follow.
Come look!
Ornithology Today!
Well, if anyone knows crows "The Crows Have Eyes III is 'good fun.
'" Well, that's hyperbolic.
I mean, they already had "fun"  and now they've added "good".
Keep reading!
"The film showcases the emotional depth and intellectual capacity of our oft-maligned friend, the crow".
We were resolute about not making an issues movie, but I'm glad they picked up on that.
It mentions you, Moira.
It does?
Where?
My eyes are blurred.
Oh, here it is.
"Moira Rose, as Dr. Clara Mandrake, is delightfully unhinged".
Do you know what they call this, gals?
An understated rave.
Oh, it's too bad you won't be there tonight.
It would've been nice to cheer you on.
- Yeah, and my plus-one, Janet from the Elmdale Chronicle, would've really loved a quote.
Well, you might want to tell your friend Janet that there just may be a bombshell attendee after all.
Yay!
A premiere!
Oh, I don't know if I have anything fancy enough to wear.
Oh, my default is always formal, but I'm sure no one will bat a side-eye at black-tie casual.
Oh, but do pack eye-drops!
The film's first third is densely packed with exposition, and you won't want to blink.
Are you sure it's okay that we haven't seen the first two movies?
Oh, it's actually best.
A lot of this film blatantly contradicts what's been established in the first two.
Sorry, Twyla.
I'm not going to eat now!
-  - Both:   - Okay, here we go.
- That was a fun car ride.
Yes, it was very fun.
Thank you so much for all the hot tips you were giving our Uber driver.
For a second, I was concerned about my rating, but I think he seemed to enjoy all the wrong directions you were yelling at him.
David, I'm hungry.
I'm a hungry, hungry hippo 'Kay, we're not supposed to feed you right now.
Can you make me a lasagna, David?
Imagine?
No.
I think we rest this little voice, 'cause you have been chatting ever since - the dentist's office.
- Why are you so handsome?
I mean, unless you wanna keep talking.
In which case, that works as well.
How come your skin is like perfect.
It's a nine-step regimen I do twice a day.
- It's not a big deal.
- I'm tired.
Oh, okay.
Well, you know what, we should probably get you over to the bed.
Okay.
You know what I really wanna do with you?
Uh-huh.
Ethically speaking, I don't think we can do that with you in this state.
Have a baby.
'Kay, we will make a baby as soon as you sober up.
Oh no, not make a baby.
Have a baby.
Like I wanna have like a little baby with you.
And we could just love it and hold it and bounce it.
Yeah, that's a that's a big one-eighty.
- You would be such a good dad.
- Have we met?
I wish you were my dad.
Okay, now we're just spiraling off - in all directions.
- Shh!
Listen, okay?
Come here, come here.
I got a secret.
- I don't - Come on.
Mm  David?
I'm very hungry.
Okay, there's nothing I can do about that.
- Wait.
Just lie down with me.
- Okay.
- I wanna, I wanna hold you.
- Mm-hmm.
Imagine us right now, but just with a little baby.
- Johnny: Hey, Stevie!
- Hey Hey.
Oh!
What's this?
Thank you.
You didn't have to bring anything.
Oh, just a little housewarming platter, since it's my first time here.
Twyla whipped up some sandwiches.
- Hope you like mayo.
- Thank you.
Wow, so this is, this is your place.
I'm glad you didn't feel you needed to clean up on my account, you know?
It shows just how comfortable a friendship we actually have.
- I did clean up.
- Right.
That's what I meant.
You didn't feel the need to clean up, but I appreciate the fact that, uh, that you did.
How are things at the motel?
Good.
We bought the second motel!
First phase of many in the Rosebud Motel expansion.
Big things on the horizon, Stevie, which is, uh, why I wanted to sit down with you today.
But not on your bed.
Oh, here.
Right.
So Stevie, it goes without saying that you've been an invaluable part of the team.
You don't need to sell me on the team, Mr. Rose.
And when I was your age, I had a million and one ideas and things I wanted to explore, and I know it takes time to find the right fit.
Which is why I have a proposal.
Oh!
Okay.
I wanna buy you out.
Oh!
Now I know the motel has been a weight on your shoulders, and I can offer you installment payments to give up your status as owner.
And that would give you some financial stability while you take the time and figure things out.
I thought you were gonna try to talk me into coming back.
Oh, no, no.
That wouldn't be fair.
Wouldn't be fair to you.
I'm not gonna stand in the way of you finding what makes you happy.
And, and speaking of, I wanted to give you this.
Oh, wow I don't know what to say.
Well, once you get past the haircut and the dated references, I'm sure you might find something useful in there to help you get your footing.
You don't have to downplay your excitement on my account, Stevie.
I'll be just fine.
Okay, so I may have a problem.
Oh, it's barely noticeable, dear.
We'll find you an electrologist.
No, I'm talking about the viewing party.
I just got a call from the Elmdale Chronicle.
Ah yes, Jocelyn's guest.
We'll need to set aside an extra seat.
Okay, it's just that I know that you don't wanna make a big deal about of this, so I can just tell them not to come.
I may have been wrong and you may have been not wrong.
We can position this as a terrifying tale premiering in an equally spine-chilling town.
If the ornithologist review is any barometer, Alexis, we m-m-m-m-m may just have a hit on our hands.
Um, last week, you told me explicitly that this was not a premiere, and now it's too late.
Alexis, if you want to cut your teeth as a high-profile publicist, you'll need to get used to throwing things together - in a crunch.
- I have four hours!
That's eons!
When Demi decided on a Friday night at 6 pm that she wanted to celebrate her 40th in Aspen, her publicist had us in parkas by 7.
Sadly, Megan went into cardiac arrest on the flight, but she perished doing what she loved.
Um, is that your gown?
What is that for?
Oh, I thought I might throw it on for tonight.
So you're going to the screening?
Yes.
A simple "Thank you, Mother" might be a nice place to start.
Also, I thought you returned that?
I did!
Or I know I returned a dress.
A glittering, backless thing.
Stella McCartney, I think.
That was mine.
I've been looking for that.
- Blame UPS.
- Ugh!
Roland: Hey, Alexis, this better be good.
I was in the middle of a pre-show bath, and with the baby around, I only get that kind of me-time maybe - five to six nights a week, so - Mm-hmm.
I assume this has something to do with all the calls we're getting from TV stations, asking where they can park their vans?
Um, yeah.
So the premiere may be getting like a little bit bigger than I had planned.
Oh, snap!
It's a premiere now?
'Cause first you said it was, and then you said it was just a viewing party.
Yeah, and, and if it's a premiere, we're all in trouble, because my skinny jeans are in the wash.
No, it is a premiere.
Unfortunately, that decision was made like half an hour ago, so it would be really helpful if I could just tell you what I need.
Oh no, the red carpet that you told me not to order?
Yes, but at this point, I will settle for any shade of red, and it doesn't have to be sixty feet.
Okay, good, 'cause all I've got is a 20-foot Merlot in my garage.
I ripped out after the church basement flooded.
That sounds amazing.
And obviously you're coming to me for a little star power.
I get it.
It'd be good to have a name there tonight.
- No.
No.
You're the crow hook-up.
I wanted to create like a headline-grabbing moment where I release a bunch of crows just before the movie starts.
Uh, excuse me, it's a little late notice.
What about the liquor license?
'Cause I assuming people are gonna wanna be drinking through this thing.
Okay, we have a situation on our hands that needs to be solved now.
We have a 12-time Daytime Emmy Award-attending actress coming to walk a Merlot carpet in hours, and press coming from all over, bringing attention to your town.
So either you can help me out or I pull the plug now and nobody wins.
Fine.
But you owe me a prime spot on that carpet.
Wait, you wanna walk the carpet?
Honey, it's a movie premiere, is it not?
- Ugh.
- And I assume the mayor is walking the carpet as well, yes?
Yes if he has to.
Okay, I will schedule your arrival time when I get home.
I would like to request a time before Roland.
- And I'd like to go first.
- Mm-'Kay.
All right, I better get back and put my skinny jeans into the dryer.
I think they're really gonna pop on your 20-foot Merlot.
I think so too!
They're gonna pop on that carpet.
Okay.
Mm!
Okay.
Okay.
Stevie!
Perfect timing.
I was having a technical issue opening a file here.
It's, uh, being finicky.
Uh, remember, Mr. Rose?
I left you a sticky note.
Ah!
Boy, it's times like this I really miss having you around, Stevie.
Well, um, that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about, Mr. Rose.
Um, you know how you told me to take some time and figure out what made me happy?
Well, I think I have settled on something.
Is it Larry Air?
'Cause they called me for a reference, and also asked if I had any interest in becoming a pilot.
No, it's not Larry Air.
So chapter one of your book is all about trusting your instincts, and I haven't been doing that.
Oh, well, that's okay, Stevie.
I mean, learning to trust your instincts is something that comes with age and experience.
No.
I'm talking about trusting your instincts.
I think I've been taking them for granted.
So, you read my book?
Most of the first chapter.
I didn't sleep well last night, so I kind of dozed off.
Well, the first chapter is more of an introduction, right?
Setting the table.
'Kay, but what I've realized is that you've given me the opportunity to take this job and run with it.
So, if you really think you can make something out of franchising this motel, I think I want to be part of it.
You think?
I wanna be part of it.
I want back in.
Oh!
Yeah.
Well, I should probably tell you that you don't necessarily have to trust all my instincts all the time.
Since you've been gone, I did have to bring on a third business partner, and I may as well tell you that it's - Roland.
- I know.
He gave me his new business card.
Never saw so many typos on a business card.
Do you mind if we don't talk about Roland right now, 'cause I'm feeling really good about this decision.
Ah!
Yeah, me too, partner.
Me too.
Listen, while you're here, I'm wondering if I can get a couple more refreshers on what happens after the file gets opened?
Uh you may as well.
Yeah.
Morning, sunshine.
Mm.
It's 5 pm.
But good morning.
I really don't remember how I got into this bed.
I do.
You were talking.
- A lot.
- Uh-oh.
- What was I saying?
- Well, the conversation really ran the gamut.
You complimented my flawless skin and called me the Jewish Channing Tatum, which all tracks.
But then you told me you wanted us to have a baby.
What else did I say?
I put you to sleep after that.
Wait.
Are you, are you joking?
No.
No, no.
You held me close and told me to envision our lives with a child.
- I see.
- Mm-hm.
That, uh, that must've been scary for you.
It was a little triggering.
Traumatizing.
David, I know that you don't want kids, and that's fine with me, okay?
I was very high on anesthetic.
Okay, it's just that earlier today, when we were in Stevie's car because your car's always in the shop, you had mentioned that you'd always pictured yourself having a kid.
You've never pictured yourself doing something - that didn't end up happening?
- Of course.
I'm not married to Christina Aguilera, am I?
- David, I am happy - But it's with the life I've got.
I'm happy with you.
Things change.
Okay.
You're a hundred percent sure you're not just saying you don't wanna have a kid, but, in actuality, you secretly do and are repressing that need just for me?
I don't wanna undermine the significance of this conversation, but I do wanna make it known that I was watching "Bridget Jones's Baby" right before I went under.
Okay, well that makes a little more sense then.
- Mm.
- You would be a great dad, though.
Okay.
You have a big old heart in there, David.
- Yeah.
Yeah, - There it is.
- It's beating away.
- Mm-hmm?
Um Can you grab me those painkillers, please?
I think I'm gonna need a few of them if we're still planning on making it to your mom's thing tonight.
Okay, that's actually a very good idea.
I might take one myself.
Apparently the first 15 minutes are very, very dense.
- Moira!
Over here!
- Crowd:  Moira!
Moira!
Well, break a leg, sweetheart.
I'll be right here 10 feet behind you.
No, John, tonight is special, and I'd like my hand-candy by my side.
- Man: Moira!
- Oh.
Woman: Moira!
Okay, people, we actually need to walk the carpet, okay?
Move it along.
Ronnie?
Look, we had a deal.
Also, not everyone can be on the carpet at once.
Thank you.
When exactly are we gonna get this show on the road?
As soon as you're off the carpet.
Okay, because Carmine is saying that the crows are getting restless.
Mm!
Where did all these people come from?
Why are your pupils so dilated.
- No, yours are.
- No, yours are.
Why are you dressed like a limo driver?
Your mother insisted.
Why are you both glassy eyed?
What?
- Wow!
-  So the crows are ready.
You just say a few words, and then give Carmine the signal.
Alexis, Mommy's home now.
I'll take it from here.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to welcome you to a North American screening of the psychological thriller Move it along.
- "The Crows Have Eyes  The Crowening"!
Let the crowening commence!
-  -  Oh!
Alexis!
- Oh ho!
- No!
Moira: Please, everyone stay calm!
-  - Whatever you do, do not look them in the eye!
Okay, you're making them angrier!
I'm not, Alexis!
I know a bit of their language.
CAW!
CAW-CAW!
This is fucked.
The worst part is people are being robbed of the experience of seeing the film on the big screen.
No, that's not the worst part, Moira.
It's fine.
There were no serious injuries, and, because people are watching from home, there'll be more views that way.
Okay, have you seen this yet?
Some random news station just posted video of the premiere.
It's been shared 32,000 times.
Well, all press is good press, right?
You might wanna watch it first.
Reporter: Tonight, a murder of wild crows attacked would-be audience members who had come to see a movie about a crow attack.
We must warn you, the following content is pretty graphic.
- Oh!
- Okay, they weren't "wild" crows.
They were supposed to be trained.
Trained!
Some of them were painted seagulls.
This is not good, Alexis!
It sorta looks like people are running away from your movie, Moira.
You!
Look what you have done!
Look what I've done?
This was your idea, and now I have to pay Ronnie for damage to her carpet!
What were the crows even doing there in the first place?
It's called an immersive experience, David!
Immersed in lawsuits maybe.
-  - Alexis, make it stop!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 Okay, if you think you've lived through a bad day, try being our next guest.
When she showed up to a screening of her new film, "The Crows Have Eyes: The Crowening " -  Fun name!
- It is!
The last thing she expected was an actual crow attack!
Hosts:  Oh  Well, now we're being told that the whole thing was a PR stunt put out by the movie.
Now, is that clever or what?
It sure is!
We are so very lucky to be joined this morning by Moira Rose.
- Well, ach!
- Ach!
- What a ride this has been!
- Yes.
What a ride indeed, Barb!
Oh, let me first assure your viewers that not a single crow was harmed, and as for the humans, oh, nothing but a little wounded pride and one severed earlobe.
- Oh!
- Ouch!
Yeah!
Yes, everything you saw was part of a carefully orchestrated, entirely deliberate stunt.
Oh, well, it seems to have worked, Moira.
With over more than 2 million views in less than 24 hours, this video has created an incredible buzz for the movie, which, as of right now, is officially trending on Interflix.
It is?
!
Well, if you're saying it's a smash hit, then I'm just going to have to take your word for it.
As well as the word of millions of streamers across the internet, I suppose.
You know, the brilliant thing about being on streaming is that one can start the movie at any point, any time they like.
You know, Moira, I think it's safe to say you are officially back in the game!
-  - Yes!
Well, you heard it here first!
Do not adjust your sets!
Excuse me, but I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge my daughter, Alexis Rose.
This whole PR coup d'Ã©tat never would've happened without her.
Honestly, we just had fun with it.
Can't hear you.
Poor dear's not mic'd.
Well, looks like there's no stopping you two now!
- Congratulations!
- Hmhm.
- Both: Thank you!
- Alexis:   Gentlemen.
Morning.
I believe you've met my roommate, Bob.
- Roommate?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Uh, Ronnie's been nice enough to let me stay in her guest room, ever since Gwen took the house.
Yeah.
And as much as I'm enjoying the slumber party, I really think that Bob could use a change of scenery.
Maybe he could crash here for a night or six?
- Uh, yeah - I don't think we, uh, we have any clean rooms available.
Oh, I I don't mind a dirty room.
I hope that doesn't sound as sad as as it feels.
Bob, why, why don't you take a seat?
And grab some water while you're at it, 'cause you should really hydrate after all that crying.
Gwen used to love water.
Okay, I feel badly for Bob, but it's not a good look to have him wallowing around here.
Roland: Well, where do you want the guy to wallow?
I mean, Johnny, there's plenty of sad people staying at this motel.
That's not exactly how I'd describe our guests, Roland.
Well, I'm just saying, maybe he could meet a fellow wallower here?
Oh, it'd be really nice if Bob could meet somebody 'cause from what I hear, Gwen isn't exactly sitting at home.
Or, what if we take Bob out for the evening and kind of act as his wing-men Johnny, you know, the whole dating scene has kind of changed a little since you were single.
First off, we now have electricity.
-  -  Okay, all right, are you in or not?
Ooh, I'm in.
'Cause I don't wanna miss a chance to see how this plays out.
- Bob?
- Well, it it would be so nice to not be completely alone for a night.
Uh, lucky Gwen, she has another one of her male cousins visiting.
- David: This coffee's delicious.
- Thank you.
Yeah, it's it's sort of burning my hand a bit because I can't put it down on anything.
David, you know that the new coffee table is coming today, and that it takes a little bit longer when it's handmade.
Handmade, yeah.
You know what I think you should do?
Just come over here and relax for a bit.
Sit down, we could put our - our feet up on the -  You happy now?
Just do me a favour and watch these, - and don't eat them.
- Mm.
No guarantees.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Coffee table for Patrick?
- That's me, yeah.
You look super familiar.
Have we ordered from you before?
Uh, I don't know.
I I get a lot of orders.
- Do you mind if I uh ?
- Yeah, come on in.
Uh, it's just right there.
Yeah.
'Kay.
I'm sorry, this is who made your table?
- David!
- Hi.
- What're you doing here?
- Okay.
Muah.
Wow.
We're still doing that.
Uh, this is my boyfriend's place.
- FiancÃ©.
- FiancÃ©.
Yeah.
Now I remember where we met before.
- Stevie's apartment.
- At Stevie's.
Bingo.
I'm sorry for not remembering.
- I meet a lot of people.
- Mm.
That is a great sweater, by the way.
- It really brings out your lips.
- Okay.
Well, thank you for the coffee table.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I am also wearing a sweater.
A lot of sweat went into this one.
This is one of my best pieces.
You got great taste.
And from the looks of it, so does David.
Okay.
I'm gonna go uh you know, I'm gonna check on the - Perfect!
Yeah.
- Pancakes.
Say, you know what?
I was just planning on having a chill night in, but if you guys are free, I'd love for you to come by for a whiskey or - whatever.
- OKay.
You know You know what?
We'll, we'll think about that for a sec - and see, and see.
- Great!
- Hope to see you tonight.
- Okay.
And for what it's worth, you guys make a beautiful couple.
Thank you so much.
- What?
- No, you're just, your face is all red.
It's beet red.
- It is not!
- Mm-hmm.
It's flush.
- Hey, babe!
- Hey, babe!
Oh my God!
Where are you?
Is that the ocean?
I wish.
It's a poster of the ocean.
'Cause I'm actually in Stewart's dorm room right now because mine got evacuated last night - small fire ants issue.
Yikes!
Hope everything's okay.
It was a real "Fyre Fest".
You do not wanna see Krista's ankles today.
But, it's all good.
We'll be getting our dorms back in better shape than we left 'em.
- Can't wait.
- Let's talk about you!
Everyone here has been watching your video!
And to think it was all fake?
Totally fake.
Isn't that wild?
And all of these PR agencies from New York are calling to ask me how I did it.
How did you do it?
Um, it's like a little bit too complicated - to explain over this.
- Hi, Theodore!
Gorgeous view!
Hi, Mrs. Rose!
Congrats on the movie!
That last scene where you leap from your nest only to discover that your wings - aren't developed enough yet - Oh, you're too kind.
The Daily Mail called it a "flap for the ages"!
Okay, can I have my boyfriend back now, please?
- Hm.
-   Oh!
It's Buzzfeed calling about the 10 goriest Clara Mandrake accidents from the film.
Best we take it.
And don't forget, we have a conference call with the Interflix PR people in a tight 15.
- Okay.
- Wow, it seems like you've got a lot going on, Alexis.
Yes, but not too much for you.
No, don't worry about me, you're obviously in high demand.
Alexis!
They're asking about co-stars.
I can't be expected to remember everyone I meet!
Mm.
Okay, okay.
Well, I guess I do have to go, but I will see you in a few days and I can't wait!
- I can't wait either.
- Moira:  Alexis!
Okay, I'm coming.
Ugh!
Okay, love you!
Love you-  Ooh!
I don't think we're the same size, Johnny.
I might have a trouble fitting tissues into these pockets.
Oh, you won't need tissues.
There'll be no crying tonight, Bob.
You look like a million bucks.
Roland: Well, actually, Bob, in Johnny's suit there, you look like a guy who had a million bucks, but then lost it.
Very funny, Roland.
Now, the suit works, Bob.
Ronnie: Bob, in my experience, it doesn't matter what you wear.
It's all about being yourself.
I think the last person Bob wants to be right now is himself.
I agree with Roland.
I don't know if I can speak on behalf of women here You can't.
Moira used to say, when she was single, she would always be attracted to men who could make her laugh.
How'd she end up with you?
All right, why don't we try a little test run here.
Let's imagine we're in a bar.
Ronnie, do you wanna be the woman in this little scenario?
- Not a chance.
- Okay.
Mm!
Move over.
I  will be the woman.
Okay.
So we're in a bar and, uh, you see this very intriguing looking gentleman.
Okay.
Hello, I'm - I'm Gwen.
- Oh - You had to pick Gwen?
- I'm sorry, I saw Bob standing there and that was the first name I thought of.
- They're always together.
- Okay.
Hold it together.
- Pick another name!
- Okay, all right.
Uh okay, yeah.
Hi.
I'm Ronnie.
That's my friend Gwen.
Oh Okay, this is a disaster.
Thank you, Roland.
I'll take over from here.
- Bob, honestly, -  You know, just a few runs and you're gonna be drowning in phone numbers.
No.
No  I I can't breathe.
Ooh.
You know what?
Jake did a great job with this.
Mm-hmm.
I was just about to say this coffee table really brings out your lips.
Okay, what?
I can't compliment the guy?
He's talented.
You know, he's like a, a one-man operation.
Not in my experience.
And I think it was very nice of him to invite us for drinks tonight.
- Wasn't it?
- Yes, it was.
It was very nice and I think that we should get back to him about it.
About going to his place for "a whiskey or whatever"?
David, I'm fine to have drinks - with one of your exes, okay?
- Okay, first of all, Jake is nobody's ex and everybody's ex.
And second of all, going to Jake's for a drink is never just going to Jake's for a drink.
Oh oh.
So you okay, so you think he invited us over to to ?
- Yes, I do.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Well, in that case, we definitely shouldn't go.
'Cause we're not really the kind of couple that - Mm-hmm.
- Yeah That being said, if we ever did decide to have "a whiskey" with someone, Jake would be the person to do that with because he literally doesn't care about anything.
So just I'm just throwing it out there.
I mean, we always have the option of going and just having a whiskey.
Okay.
And I always have the option of online shopping and just putting things in the cart.
That's not gonna happen.
Um what's all this?
They just keep coming.
Well, congratulations.
That must mean everyone's happy.
Oh, very happy, yes.
Thanks to your little attack of the corvidae, we are Interflix's number one stream of the day.
Tied only with the fourth season of "Caroline in the City".
From Interflix.
"To Alexis, congratulations and thank you.
The competition is eating crow".
"Love, your new best friends at Interflix".
They're all for you.
Not those - those are from Joyce Dewitt.
I didn't want to overwhelm you, dear, I know you're being pulled in another direction.
Though, you might find a bit more delectation in this.
No, I do.
I I just like haven't received flowers from someone I wasn't friends with.
What do I do?
What do you want to do?
I can't leave now.
If you're worried about the flowers, they'll likely be dead in a week.
Yeah, like my career if I walk away with everything that's going on.
I've already made Ted wait an extra month.
I can't back out now.
So you you weigh your options.
On the one hand, you are perched on the precipice of a dream come true and you can jump knowing, possibly for the first time, that you can succeed at anything to which you put your mind.
And on the other hand?
- What other hand?
- Ted!
Dear Ted.
Yes, this is a quandary.
Well, things seem to be going well.
Yeah, look, they're standing pretty close together.
That must be a good sign.
Yeah, and he's not crossing his arms.
That's good body language.
And they're hugging!
Uh-huh.
And now he's walking away.
Okay.
Well?
How'd it go, Bob?
It looked like you two were hitting off.
What're the odds of running into my marriage counselor here?
I'm sorry, did you just say you picked up your marriage counselor?
No.
I'm saying she told me she can't keep seeing me.
Apparently, there's a conflict of interest and, uh, she's chosen to go with Gwen.
But I can't blame her.
Okay, can we try my system now?
We all laugh, on the count of three, as if Bob just told a very funny joke.
Oh, no pressure.
Well, you don't actually have to tell a joke, Bob.
Just act like you did.
And that might attract uh you know, someone's attention.
What if they ask me what I said?
Well, they're not gonna ask you what you said.
I don't know, Johnny.
This sounds like a really complicated plan.
- Mm-hmm.
- It couldn't be more simple.
Just follow my lead.
All:  It's working.
It's working.
Working.
Is something funny?
Well, now that you mention it Because it looked like you were laughing at me.
Roland:  No, It's, it's just my very available friend, Bob here, just said something so funny.
- What'd you say?
- You said they wouldn't ask.
Ronnie: Okay, I'm not saying I'm bailing on this, but I think I'm gonna go mingle and I might not come back.
It's not so much, uh, what he said, it was just, uh, it was a funny observation.
Well, next time, observe someone else.
Crrrash and burn, Johnny.
Boy, I I buckled under the pressure.
But she was a dead ringer for Gwen.
Oh, didn't know we were bringing our friends tonight.
'Kay, I knew I shouldn't have worn this shirt.
No, it's nice, it's nice.
Is it new?
And does it come in an adult size?
It's not new.
I just haven't worn it yet.
- So it is new then.
- Is that cologne I smell?
No.
This is a leather-scented body moisturizer.
So, you you moisturized your body then.
You know what?
Why don't we not do this?
This is getting a bit complicated.
The only thing that's complicated here is the length of your sleeves.
Go long, go short.
Just pick one.
Um, as for this?
If one of us wants to leave and the other one wants to stay, then - We both leave.
- We both leave, yeah.
So I think you should knock on the door because these arms are nice and warmed up.
All right.
-  - Hi, boys.
So glad you could make it.
Come on in.
Oh wow.
A lot of people are here for drinks, David.
Yeah, a few more are on their way.
Make yourselves at home, boys.
- Great shirt, by the way.
- Aw.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
Um - We left our wine in the car.
- Oh.
So we should go get that.
Oh, don't worry about it.
Plenty of vino here.
Yeah, it's just that ours is um - kosher.
- Mm.
Well, hurry back.
We're gonna start the massage circle soon.
- Oh - Don't wanna miss it.
Think you're up for the massage circle?
- This is way too many people.
- Yeah.
You have your coat.
We should go.
And Stevie?
Oh my God.
Huh.
What're you doing here?
- What're you two doing here?
- We were - We were just - Invited for drinks?
I don't know what you're talking about.
We came here to say hi - and now we're leaving.
- Mmhmm.
Can I not have one thing for myself?
No.
Anyway, we're gonna go.
You gonna come with?
Uh I still have like half a drink left, so I think I'm gonna finish it here, and then meet you guys later?
- No, you won't.
- No, I won't.
- Okay.
- Have fun.
Bye.
Ted:  Hey, sorry I'm late.
Myrtle was laying her eggs and the whole team was really excited.
Mmm!
Yeah, I bet.
Fresh omelets.
Well, Myrtle's a green sea turtle, and they only spawn every two years, so eating her eggs would actually disrupt an entire ecosystem.
Plus, there's like a ton of cholesterol.
Mm.
Um, well, it sounds like you're super busy, so I don't wanna take up too much of your time, um, but I actually wanted to talk to you about something.
I know what you're going to say, Alexis.
- You do?
- I've been dropping the ball when it comes to our phone dates.
Between juggling work and, and the time difference No, Ted, you haven't done anything wrong.
We've both been so busy with work, and then on top of all of that, you've been renovating your entire apartment for me.
Well, I put some screens on the windows.
I wouldn't really call it a renovation.
Okay, well, you bought a juicer.
Um, but the more I've been thinking about it, the more I feel like - I think you should stay where you are.
- maybe I should stay here.
Sorry, did, did you say something?
No.
Um What did you say?
I can't have you come here, Alexis.
You'll hate it.
And I'm not just saying that because the screens that I installed are actually attracting more bugs somehow.
But you'd be leaving everything that you're doing to come here, and I can't guarantee that there won't have another trip that takes me away for days at a time.
D-don't get me wrong, I want you here so bad, but I know you.
And no matter how many juicers I buy, this place just won't feel like home.
Sorry.
I can't tell if the screen's frozen, or if you're just really shocked.
But if you still want to come, I'm not gonna tell you not to.
No, no, no, no.
Um you've made some very valid points.
Yeah.
I didn't even tell you about the shared bathroom situation.
Okay, well maybe you could've led with that.
Would've saved us some time.
Um, but I guess we just wait it out?
Seems like our only option.
Yeah, until somebody invents teleportation.
Okay, well, um nobody's home, so why don't we start by teleporting you out of that shirt?
That's not really how teleportation works, but I think that I can  Aww not again!
I'm so sorry, uh, but the ants are back and, uh, I think what we're about to do probably wouldn't end very well if a fire ant was involved.
Um, rain check?
Rain check.
-  I love you!
-  Uh, mm, oh!
Love you.
Hey, I'm heading out.
Calling it a night?
Well, actually, my night is just beginning.
Whoa Welcome to the players' club.
No, I'm not high-fiving that.
Look, her name is Vanessa, and she has a very single, very attractive friend over there, who was just telling me about all the trouble she's having with her car.
Bob, this is right up your alley.
Nobody knows their way around cars like you.
Yeah, I, uh, was really hoping to not talk shop.
Bob, just go over and talk to her.
Look, be yourself.
Have a mint.
Go, go, go, go.
And that, gentlemen, is how it's done.
Bye!
You know, Roland, I do not miss being single.
- Whoa, here's to that.
-  Cheers, my friend.
Not that I didn't have fun in my day.
They actually used to call me "the closer".
Yeah.
Well, that was probably because women used to close out their tabs and go home when you came into the bar.
All right, speaking of closing out tabs, I think we should get out of here.
Which is what the women used to say to each other when they saw you walking through the door.
I'm not setting you up anymore, Roland.
Which is that what your matchmaker said!
-  - Oh boy
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1  Announcer: Two balls and two strikes on Hernandez.
And there's a well-placed bunt!
Why did he hit the ball like that?
So that is called a bunt.
It's uh, it's tactical.
It allows the guy on first to get over to second.
Okay.
Who came up with the word "bunt"?
Sounds like something you'd need to see a surgeon for.
David, this is an important game.
You told me you could get into this.
I was referring to the pizza.
But, also, the game.
What do we have here?
I seem to have stumbled into some sort of gentlemen's cavern.
Hey, thanks for letting me stay here tonight, Mrs. Rose, When David told me he wanted to install a Japanese toilet at my place, he neglected to mention that it would involve - taking out a wall.
- It was in the email.
Also, you will be thanking me when you experience the heated, motion-sensor toilet seat.
So, David, I take it you'll be employed as cheerleader for whatever televised sporting event is unfolding for the remainder of the day?
Alas, this is Patrick's day.
We're doing what Patrick wants.
- Yes!
- Wow, - someone's enjoying their day!
-  Sorry.
Just cleared the bases.
It turns out Herb Ertlinger, the great fruit vintner, is rabid fan of the Crows movie - good luck finding someone who isn't - and he would like to name a wine after me.
- Oh my - They should call it a a Moira RosÃ©.
Yes, that's what he has in mind.
Amazing!
Congrats, Mrs. Rose!
Mm.
What news!
Yes, but he wants me to sample the fruits of his labor this very day!
Well, this seems like a very important moment in your life.
I only wish I could be there.
I can't go alone.
Well, unfortunately, I told my fiancÃ© I'd watch the game with him - Just go, David.
- Okay.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
You guys might wanna rehearse a little more next time.
The extraction did feel a bit strained.
-  That was you.
- Wha?
- Love you.
-  -  - Announcer: And a sigh of relief for the beleaguered bullpen   There are my fierce women, ready to elevate their lives!
I'm so glad you decided to come today.
Well, you pushed pretty hard for it, Alexis.
- You said you'd buy me lunch.
- Mhmm.
As Elevation's official regional brand ambassador and regional marketing invigorator, I need to ask you guys: are you ready for a total physical and emotional transformation?
- Nah, but I'll do your class.
- Mm.
I didn't know they'd make us change out of our own workout clothes.
Yeah, I kinda wish I knew that before I spent all that money on my LuLu Limes.
- Okay.
- I found a stain on my pants.
Are we sure that they clean these?
- 'Kay, Stevie  - Alexis!
It's wonderful to see all these new recruits you've brought for us today.
Leadership is thrilled with all of your hard work.
Oh my God, I'm blushing.
Um, ladies, meet Citrus.
Citrus runs our East Coast wing, so we are very lucky to have him here today.
You know, I should also tell you that he's been very impressed with all of the work you've done for us these past few weeks.
I'm sorry, who's "he"?
Oh, good point.
Who's "he"?
Well, if you keep this up, you'll find out soon enough.
Twyla, Stevie, Jocelyn, and Ronnie, have a great class.
How does he know all of our names?
Am I crazy or is he really cute?
Okay, ladies, are we ready to elevate?
- Nah.
- What if I just wait in the car until you're ready for lunch?
'Cause I'm just getting a really weird vibe from this place.
Stevie, we've talked about this.
You are a businesswoman now and part of that means that you need to be like physically and mentally sharp.
And also, I get paid for everyone that signs up, so mm, mm, mm.
All right, my Elevators, we are ascending, not depending.
All our troubles, all our worries, we're going to elevate above them.
Can I get an 'oh yeah' if you're up on my level!
Class: Oh yeah!
Stevie:  Oh yeah  Hey, Johnny.
Listen, I don't wanna creep you out or anything, but I was just peering into your son's bedroom Okay, not off to a good start, Roland.
Well, do you know that Patrick's sitting in there - all by himself?
- Uh, yes, I'm aware.
He's spending the night with us.
Patrick is practically family now.
Ah.
Have you told him that?
Well, no, I haven't told him.
I mean, I haven't exactly said it out loud.
Yeah I don't know, Johnny.
Not having the big father/ son-in-law chat feels like a missed opportunity to lay down some laws.
Maybe Patrick should get "the talk" from old Uncle Roland.
'Kay, nobody's having a talk with Uncle Roland.
Look, everything is fine.
If I feel like having a talk, I'll have a talk.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a few things to attend to.
I remember when Jocelyn's dad gave me the talk.
I mean, he was trying to talk me out of getting married, but she was 9 months pregnant at the time, so he really didn't have a leg to stand on.
But I'll tell you, I could not get out of that sauna fast enough.
No way!
The kid's just in there by himself, Johnny.
Something to think about.
Okay, so how did this happen?
I'm shocked he'd give you a second chance after that train wreck of a commercial.
Mark my words, David, Herb - Ertlinger.
- Mm-hmm.
Won't be the last we see to clamber out of the woodwork now that I have a hit film on my hands.
Spines tend to liquidate in the presence of success.
Speaking of.
Herb!
ERT-linger.
ERT.
LINGER.
- Herb Ertlinger.
- Nailed it first try.
Both:  Hey, bygones be bygones about the TV spot.
At least the print ad worked out.
Pretty hard to mess up one of those!
Clearly you haven't seen the heartburn ads - she shot with Anne Geddes.
-  Herb, I would like to introduce you to a potential vendor.
This is my son, David Rose.
I'm sure you've heard of Rose Apothecary?
I have not, no.
But I'd be happy to discuss a buy with whatever store this is, - if it means something to you.
-  Okay.
I think we might need to sample the product first.
Ah!
My wife and I got a real kick out of that Crows movie.
So we would love to make our Moira RosÃ© an exclusive and limited release.
This is what we're thinking for the label.
Well, hello!
Who is she and how do we get a mouthful of her?
!
Now, it's important that you believe in the product you're selling, so we have a few options: there's the strawberry-peach, the ground fruits blend, and a lovely banana rosÃ©.
Huh?
- Mmm.
Rich in potassium.
- Mm-hmm.
So, uh, sample at your leisure.
I'll come back with some coffee grounds and a cheese board.
Again, we are so thrilled to have you here, Moira.
Enjoy.
Thank you so much.
- Poor thing.
-  Okay.
Here is to being able to share the perks of the industry with you.
- Salut.
-  Cheers.
Oh, I had my reservations about banana.
Um, that's strawberry-peach.
Oh dear, it tastes like Amoxicillin.
This one's burning my throat.
These are terrible!
Well, we have to pick one, David.
Do we?
You really want people associating your name with this laundry detergent?
I would never sell this at my store.
Okay, enough.
Whew.
Now I'm getting notes of tomato.
- Ugh.
-  Announcer: Bottom of the 8th, Tigers down by one.
Great pitching duel today Oh, hey, Mr. Rose.
Patrick!
Uh, yeah, I was gonna say hello, I, uh, didn't wanna interrupt.
No, no, not at all.
I'm just watching the game.
Hey, do you want some pizza?
Uh yeah, I could go for some 'za.
Ordered it a while ago, so it might be a bit cold by now, but Oh, that's okay, cold pizza can be good.
- Mm.
- Hot pizza's good.
Too-hot pizza - not so good.
- I got that happening.
-  Yeah.
Oh, is this thin crust?
I think it's just regular.
Oh yeah, well, I love a regular crust.
Announcer: Jackson on the mound.
Yeah, cheese, tomato sauce, bread.
- Can't beat that combination.
-  Announcer: Here's the wind-up - and the pitch!
You know, speaking of great combinations, you and David - Oh!
- Oh, uh did we get another hit?
That's the other team, unfortunately.
Oh boy.
Almost got a glove on it, huh?
That would've been good.
You know, I was gonna say, you and David Oh, he and Mrs. Rose went to some wine tasting thing.
Oh, he went with Mrs. Rose, yeah, the woman I'm married to?
You know, I was just flashing on you and David  Oh, come on!
This is not happening.
What is happening?
!
Oh, you know, we, we can talk about this later.
It's not, it doesn't really matter.
Fellas!
-  - Ugh!
Yes, Stevie!
You're crushing it.
You're breaking through and I can see it!
- Ronnie -  You too!
- Twyla, where are we going?
- Up!
And what're we leaving behind?
Class: Everything and everyone!
Yes!
Push past those demons!
Leave it behind you as we ascend to the gateway.
- Jocelyn, do you see it?
- I think so!
And class!
Great job, everyone!
Women:  And remember, I wanna see all of you signing up for that gateway!
Good work.
Oh yeah, I feel amazing.
Does anyone wanna sign up with me?
I'm happy to share a tent!
If babies are allowed, I am in.
Consider me a convert.
I'm gonna go grab a couple of those Elevation Hydration bottles.
So, Stevie, what did you think?
Okay, yeah, I didn't hate it, but I mean, does anybody even know what "the gateway" is?
Um, well, I think it's pretty obvious  Although, if it'd make you feel better, I can totally like clarify some of the language with Citrus.
Yeah.
Um, hey!
Citrus?
Yeah?
Well, first of all, so great to finally experience what we're marketing.
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it, Alexis.
Although, from a marketing perspective, I think it'd be really helpful to just like clarify some of the language that we're using.
Okay.
Like what?
Well, first of all, I noticed that you referred to, um, like "demons" a lot.
- Well, we all have demons!
- Yes, and I get that.
- Carbs.
Am I right?
- Both:  Right.
But I'm also talking about actual demons.
Yes Okay.
I guess I'm just asking for the people signing up right now, um, is the gateway like a symbol for something or is it like an actual gateway?
Oh!
It's, it's a symbol.
- Okay, good.
- Both:  But it's also a literal gateway into the sky.
Gotcha.
I hope that cleared everything up.
- Totally.
-  Great.
Jocelyn: I'm just signing up.
I can't Oh it's gonna be good.
Hey, Jocelyn?
Can I see that sign-up sheet for a sec?
Oh, I haven't finished filling out my social Oh, that's okay.
I'm just gonna go and destroy this right now, because I get the creeping suspicion that this place is like, not okay.
Like I feel like this is more than just a fitness class.
- What do you think it is?
- Um, I think it's a cult.
And like not the good kind.
Not like when you go to India to follow a long-haired, sexy man around for a couple months and then come home with a bangin' yoga body.
Yeah, if only someone had pointed out how weird this was from the beginning.
Alexis, can I still go on the trip?
I'm not saying that I need it.
It's just last weekend I snuck Roland Jr. Into the ball room at Ikea, just so I could eat a meatball by myself.
No.
No.
No one is going on the trip.
And I am so sorry for making you guys sign up for this.
Well, I'm keeping the Hydration bottles.
I can just dump out the crystal water.
Just a heads up, you guys, they're almost sold out of the "nocturnal affirmation" cassette tapes, so - Twy - Now I just need to buy one of their cassette players.
Because you have to make sure they're playing at the right speed when you're sleeping.
Twy, this is a cult.
I brought you to a cult.
Oh my gosh, did you not know that?
My mom tried to take me to the gateway for spring break one year.
I just thought I was supporting your career.
Ugh, how did I fall for this?
Cults prey on sad, weak, vulnerable people.
I'll try not to take that personally.
I've just been so desperate to like throw myself into work, and I clearly missed all the signs and now I've like endangered all of us.
Well, there's an exit sign right there.
Yup, but the arrow's pointing straight up.
There was an emergency exit in the change room.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yeah.
Ugh!
Okay, you know what?
I'm making a blend.
Yes.
Make us a nice Moira-lot or a Moira Rose-ling.
Hey, not to be too effusive, but I'd call that one potable.
I have had worst things in my mouth.
I'm so happy that I wrestled you away today for this oenological escapade.
I finally have you all to myself, David.
When's the last time you and I had a whole day together with nary a care in the world?
I mean, I am in the middle of planning a wedding, while also building a successful retail empire.
Yes, you are.
Then grant me this precious moment before there's a ring on your finger - to say chin chin to you and your husband-to-be.
This feels remarkably selfless.
You and Patrick are two good grapes.
Hmm Different notes, different tannins, but together, you've managed to make one perfect blend.
- Thank you.
- That being said - Oh my God.
- If I may impart a slice of marital sagacity: you and I, we're two potent grapes.
You know, there's a lot of your father in Patrick.
Don't need that.
But just because their notes are subtle doesn't mean they require any less attention.
Says the woman who literally convinced me to leave my partner alone at home, watching a baseball game.
You know I'm right.
Your father and I have produced beautiful wine together for over forty years.
Ew.
And I have absolutely no doubt that your relationship with Patrick is going to get even better with age.
Okay, I hope we've landed on something, because all I have left is this cherry ice wine  and I think it might be corked.
Nope.
My David has put together - a delicious blend right here.
- Mmhmm-hmm!
Ugh.
No.
That's not the one we picked.
- Huh?
- That's not the one we picked.
What?
Well, let's retrace our steps.
- No.
- How many combinations can there be?
No.
Announcer: We'll be back to the ball game right after Yeah, I guess I don't need to turn the volume down - for these commercial breaks.
- Oh, whatever works for you.
-  -  It's just I thought you had something that you wanted to talk about?
Oh, no, just wondering what the inflation was on concessions these days, 'cause it's been years since I've been to a ball game.
Well, it's highway robbery.
Yeah, you got that right.
It just sorta seemed like you wanted to talk about David for a second.
Felt like that's where you were goin'.
No, I sure.
Yeah, I can talk about David.
Yeah, my son  Who, uh, you will be walking down the aisle with very soon.
Well, technically, you won't be walking with him down the aisle, but but um Mr. Rose, I don't wanna cut you off, but um  I'm glad we have a minute to talk.
Because I, I hope it goes without saying that, as lucky as I feel to have met David, I also feel incredibly lucky to be joining your family.
Huh.
I love your son and I will always do everything I can to respect him and to protect him from all of the things in life that can set him off.
And there are many, many things that can set him off  Oh, I'm aware, yeah.
Um oh boy, that pretty much covers it.
Uh, I was only gonna say that I I hope you treat him with respect, which you just said you would, and, of course I already knew it.
I'm glad we had this talk, Mr. Rose.
Me too.
Me too.
- All right.
-  - Both:  -  Announcer: Iverson at the plate, and here comes the pitch!
- Announcer: Iverson with a - Oh Oh!
It's going GOING!
GONE!
- Oh!
-  - Whoa-ho!
- Hey!
- Both:  - Wow!
So, it was this one?
Um, let me just triple check.
No.
No, it's not.
Did it oxidize?
Is that why we can't recognize the tastes?
Okay, if neither of you can remember which one it was, maybe we just, we just call this off.
The wife and I had reservations at the Elmdale Inn an hour ago.
It was strawberry-radish.
We don't do anything with radishes.
Ooh, maybe you should.
That sounds refreshing.
- We're not making a new wine!
-  There's no need to raise your voices, Herbert.
Okay, speaking of Herbert, is it Herbert or Erbert?
Like when people say Herb or Erb?
I took the liberty of calling your husband, Moira, because somebody has to drive you two home and it's certainly not going to be me.
Both:  Our designated grapes!
Well, I see the sampling went well.
-  - Both: Okay.
We couldn't find a wine.
Well, it sorta smells like you found all the wine.
- What?
- Yeah Mr. Ertlinger, I hope this doesn't stand in the way of our doing business.
Your wife ensured that that won't be happening.
Between the two of them they could not find a single wine they were willing to put Moira's name on.
- I said radish!
- We  Could you please escort your family out of here?
I am very late for a dinner!
I am offering a major apology if that'll help.
Okay.
I take it keys are in your purse, Moira?
-  Es in a Nokia - I'm gonna uh - I'm gonna start the car.
- Okay, great!
- Yeah.
- What?
!
How was your class, Alexis?
Um, it was a big success.
Thank you for asking.
Everyone had a great time and the clients were like super impressed.
Oh, that's good.
I wonder if that means they'll give you priority boarding - when you enter the gateway?
- Oh my God, Stevie did this, didn't she?
Now, do the step machines actually lift off the ground, or are the step machines just there to help you practice for when you walk onto the spaceship?
Come on, David, she didn't know.
- Thank you!
- But now that you do, does it just make the journey to the gateway - that much more meaningful?
- Okay, you know what?
Honestly, this whole situation is starting to gross me out.
It's like I'm sharing a room with my twin brothers who kiss.
- Mm!
- Mm -  - Well, look at this!
We have a full house here.
- Just came in to say goodnight.
- That's not necessary.
- John!
Open, please!
- Yeah.
Hey!
I like sleepovers!
Anyone think I might like a sleepover?
Alexis: Ew Ew!
Johnny: You know, spending a little extra time together is not such a bad idea since we're losing Alexis soon to the gateway.
- OH MY GOD-DUH!
- A simple mistake, honey.
So does this happen every night?
- Um, no.
No, it doesn't.
- Oh Alexis: Uh, okay.
- Mm!
Stop!
-
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1  Well, this is a big moment in the expansion of Rosebud Motel Group.
Today we cut the ribbon on a new Rosebud Motel.
Can I take my blindfold off now?
Oh, not yet, honey, we gotta wait for Johnny's big reveal.
- Okay.
- Let's get to it, let's cut the ribbon.
Roland.
Okay.
Wanna hold that?
Stevie, you wanna hold this, hold it up?
Mr. Rose, do we really need to do this.
Yeah, yes, yes we do.
Moira, scissors.
Hey, how about a drum roll, Stevie?
- I'd rather not.
- Yeah, you know what, I'm just gonna take off the blindfold.
Okay.
Moira, scissors please.
Okay, what are these?
These won't cut a ribbon.
They're cuticle shears, John.
Do you expect hedge clippers to be drawn from my purse?
Okay, alright, hold it up and hold it taut please.
I'm sorry, taut?
What is that, old English?
How bout I hold it tight?
Mr. Rose, just cut the ribbon.
- Pull it, pull it.
- Okay.
- Here we go.
Okay.
- Cut it.
How long is this gonna take, Johnny, should I cancel my New Year's plans?
Okay, you know what, just drop the ribbon, drop it.
- Alright.
- Yay.
Okay, step one now complete, onto step two.
- And what would that entail?
- Deep cleaning the rooms.
Well, I'd like to be put to use, what's step three?
You know, I think I need to lie down, that blindfold was quite taut.
That's me in front of a volcano.
Yeah.
In the jungle, in outer space, that's another volcano.
As maid of honor, I pick the second volcano.
Okay, you are hanging onto that job by a thread.
Ray, do you have anything that'll make us look a little less like the kind of couple that gets married at a theme park?
Oh, I think what David is trying to say - is maybe something a little simpler.
- Yeah I'm looking for understated, Annie Leibowitz for Vanity Fair.
I want us to look like two very rich people that have just woken up after fainting - on a dusty old couch.
- Mmm.
I don't know if you've thought about wedding favors, but might I suggest mouse pads, I got thousands downstairs.
- Let me get you some samples.
- Wonderful.
Okay, as maid of honor, I have to say You don't have to say anything.
Anyway, I thought it would be festive if I got you a little pre-wedding gift.
- What?
- Mhmm.
I am sending you to get pampered - before this afternoon's shoot.
- Do I get pampered?
No, you get to drive him to the spa where he will indulge in a relaxing five minute scalp massage followed by some light sun.
That'll also give me enough time to art direct this situation 'cause clearly Ray wouldn't know my aesthetic if it ran him over.
I'm sorry, did you say sun?
Yeah, like a, a kiss on the cheeks, uh, um a gentle spray.
Okay, well, thanks for the gift, David, but no thank you.
I'll take it.
Actually sounds less like a gift and more like a chore.
Okay, I am doing you a favour.
- Oh.
- Okay.
Stevie, take our photo please for a moment, fast please.
- Ooh, uh.
- Okay.
Yeah, see, side by side my Mediterranean complexion makes you look a little anemic so the spray will just even it out.
Okay, it's not that bad.
Okay, well, the lighting is not good so.
I mean - Hmm.
- Just as an example, here is a sample mouse pad that Jocelyn made for the computer lab at school.
The Under the Sea theme is only available during winter months.
My God, Ted, what are you doing here?
I wanted to surprise you.
- Oh my God, okay, babe, hi.
- Hi, hi.
- Hmm.
- Hm.
Hi, uh sorry there were limited options at the airport gift shop.
"Have a great flight", so sweet.
You're here in the flesh.
Hm, I missed you so much.
Um, who's babysitting the turtles?
Well, I am a part of a team of 30 so they let me take the long weekend off.
The long weekend?
It's Sunday, it's over.
Yeah, I know, I was supposed to get here yesterday morning but my first connecting flight was delayed and then I got food poisoning from some bad milk on my second connecting flight.
Ew Ted, they made you drink milk on the airplane?
No I actually ordered it, and in my defense, they were serving cookies, so.
Okay, so um, how long do we actually have then?
Just today.
Oh my God.
Okay.
Then enough about the milk thing even though I have like 50 more questions about it.
Yeah, yeah, no need to milk it.
Ooh, we definitely don't have time for that.
No I just, I just wanna be with you and catch up and talk.
Okay, so my parents are out and David's at the store so maybe we can just like be with each other right now, and then later if we feel like it we can talk.
- Yeah, but I - You're not still sick, - are you?
- No I just.
- Okay.
-  Yeah.
Okay, we can do this first.
Boy, I look at this place, untouched from the 60s.
These motels were a gold mine, Roland, all they need is a little dusting.
And bleach, lots of bleach.
You know, there are boutique hotels that would kill for this level of authenticity.
I'm thinking of turning this place into the Presidential Suite and charging a premium for it.
I'm reminded John of Shanghai and our Party Secretary Suite with its own aquarium, I'd lay in a claw foot tub watching the orcas.
- Joc.
- And we're back.
You know that staycation we've been talking about?
Why don't we just do that here?
Well, Roland, that-that sounds good, but uh, that just can't happen.
As a new business owner it's dangerous to treat your assets as personal possessions.
That's my John.
At Rose Video, he made me purchase the Blu-ray of my gritty feminist police drama, "Miranda Rights".
I rented that three times.
Miranda is so sassy when she went undercover for that wet T-shirt contest.
Hey, the sooner we get this place guest ready, the sooner we can start making a profit.
Yeah.
Well, that sounds good to me.
Bob's been charging us a fortune to babysit.
Speaking of which, we should get going.
Bob has his first cry therapy session tonight.
Okay.
Bye.
Well, if that isn't team work, I don't know what is.
Ah, I know, the room looks pretty good, huh?
No I'm, I'm talking about the way you and I, threw them off the fragrance so that we could keep this suite to ourselves.
No that's not what I was doing, Moira.
No, it's very important at this stage to keep the bar set very high for Roland.
- John.
- Now I just told them they couldn't stay here.
Oh, be careful, John, lest you suffer vertigo from the dizzying heights of your moral ground.
Are you sure this is what you want, David?
This looks like someone put a tarp over their living room furniture.
Yeah, I'm going for an English estate in the off-season.
Okay, it's just uh, do you really want these photos to say my relationship is an old estate in the off-season?
Why don't I show you the county fair backdrop, I think a Ferris wheel would look so cute on a mouse pad.
I don't think we're gonna do the mouse pads.
-  -  - Oh hi.
- Hi.
- Why do you look ?
- Hot?
Oh, I got a spray tan.
Patrick gave you his appointment, didn't he?
No, I just put mine on your credit card.
Okay, well that's fraud and you're a criminal so where even is my life partner?
He's coming.
I think he spent maybe a second too long in there.
-  -  Are you happy now, David?
Is this what you wanted?
- You look - I look like a cheese puff.
Okay, you said it, not me.
Um what, uh, what ha, what happened?
Did they use the Allez Vous bronzer on you?
I don't know, David, they asked me what I wanted, I told them just to give me what you usually get.
Well, why would you do that?
I'm practically Sicilian, you don't need that much sun.
I don't know how it works, David.
Well, couldn't find it.
Oh, hi Patrick, I almost didn't recognize you, you look like one of those people who has that skin condition from eating one too many carrots.
- Okay.
- You know what?
I can't be in photos like this so I'm going to uh, - I'm gonna go.
- No, no, no, no, we've got this all set up, - you'll barely notice it.
- Oh.
And that's what Photoshop's for, just to lighten it up a bit.
Yes, just have fun with it.
- Yes, have fun.
- Okay, Patrick, I'm gonna have to ask you to smile a little more.
I think this is probably as good as it's gonna get - right now, Ray.
- Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, here's what I'm thinking, we do that like three to four more times, and then we go on a romantic walk to your house and we like hang out there for a little bit.
Yeah um, that plan sounds really active, Alexis.
Mhmm.
But uh my mom's staying at my place and uh, I'd rather not walk in on her and her zumba instructor, don't wanna have to zoom back here.
Is everything okay?
It's okay to admit that I tuckered you out.
No it's, it's not that.
Okay, then what is it?
I just thought that it was important that we have this conversation in person.
You're starting to sound like me trying to end things with B-Rock on the Backstreet Boys Millennium Tour.
Ted, you're not like trying to break up with me, are you?
No I'm not breaking up with you.
Oh okay, thank God.
So what is it?
I got offered a job.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
- Is it a bad job?
- No it's a great job, they wanna make me a permanent part of the research team in the Galapagos.
Okay, define permanent.
It's a three year contract.
Okay, that's a long time.
Yeah, I just, I keep waiting for things to get easier for us.
So um, what are you gonna tell them?
I, I don't know, I mean I had three plane rides to think about it and, and I wanted to have a solution by the time I got here, but seeing you, I don't wanna lose this.
Okay, so what do we, what do we do?
Do I like move to the Galapagos?
Or I move back here.
And turn down your dream job.
Okay, this just got like very heavy.
I feel like I'm sweating, I also feel like very cold.
Yeah.
I, I took the weekend because I want us to have a few days to talk about it, but then Yeah, no, the milk, I know.
Um, Ted, I think I'm gonna need a minute.
You know that I can't make big decisions under pressure, that's how I ended up with a pixie cut at prom.
There has to be a way through this.
I liked this a whole lot more before we started talking.
Moira, what's going on in there?
Oh!
It's my hands, John, it's the water, it's freezing cold.
Well, then move your hands.
How will I know if it's getting warmer if I'm not touching it?
Well Moira, you've got the cold tap on, you've gotta balance it with the hot.
-  - Oh.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not an alchemist, John, and it's not like there's a his sink for when the hers is inoperable.
Okay, Moira.
Excuse me while I try to pass through.
Oh John, these door frames, it's like trying to force oneself through the eye of a needle.
I think uh, the point's been made, Moira.
Oh, so you're willing to reconsider a room upgrade?
- Upgrade?
- Mhmm.
Oh, I thought you were talking about a romantic weekend.
We start with a weekend and go from there.
You don't believe we deserve this perquisite, John, at least until we secure a way out of here.
Moira, yeah, the room is bigger, it might even be nicer, but haven't we managed to make due here in this room over the past few years?
Yes, in the same way road crustations are known to make due in old soda cans.
And what about the kids?
We're just going to abandon them here?
They're practically middle-aged and they're not denying theirselves betterment, - why should we?
-  Alright, maybe it is good business practice to sample the product before selling.
Well, whatever you think is best, Mr. Rose.
I've packed your weekender, it's in the car.
See, these are good, we could use any of these.
David, those are just ones where you look good.
-  - Well only took me nine showers to still look like this.
See, this is good, this is how you were supposed to look.
Oh, well then if that's all it took should we just head back to Ray's?
I don't know, do you think he'd have time?
No, I was being very, very sarcastic.
- Oh.
- Are there any usable shots?
Both: Umm.
None of the ones where you can see your face or hands, - There's a few I think that - but we're still looking.
- Might be good.
- Cool, so I guess my relatives will just have to imagine what the person I'm marrying looks like and how happy I am to be with him, and Okay fine, ooh, maybe we just open up the guest list a bit and invite a few more of your distant relatives, or I do have head shots from my pageant days that I could mail out to them.
David, can we just agree to stop making this wedding a bigger deal than it needs to be.
We are not these people.
Okay.
Well, this is a teachable moment for all of us.
You know, look at his tan, looks great, the lighting's right, maybe Stevie should take a few candid shots - and see what happens.
- You're insane.
- David no.
- No I'm not.
We are looking for photos and here we are.
Oh my God.
Okay, well the tan does look good.
- Ooh see.
- Okay fine, like maybe a couple more but then that's it.
Okay fine, alright.
- What is your hand?
- Oh that's weird.
- Huh?
-  -  -    Hey Alexis, I haven't seen you running in a while.
Thanks, Twy.
Yeah, I just needed to get out and clear my head.
Is everything okay?
I don't know.
Okay, do you think a smoothie might help?
No, I think I'll just take a smoothie.
Okay, I'll just be right over there if you need me.
Oh hi, Ted.
Um Alexis.
I know, without sounding too forward, - I've seen you around -  and uh, you know, I have to say, I think that you are the most beautiful girl this town's ever seen.
Alexis, Alexis, here's your smoothie.
Twy, do you ever have those days where you wonder why things just can't be easier?
Why, what's going on?
Ted got a job.
- Another one?
- No, the same one.
He got offered the same job he already has?
No, same job, they just want him to stay longer, like forever.
Oh.
Yeah, so it's like what now?
Do I leave everything behind and move to some random island to be with the love of my life?
'Cause I did that with Harry Styles in England, it was like too rainy.
That is hard.
I feel like now's the point where you normally have some surprisingly helpful advice.
I know you, Alexis, and you always make the right decision.
- Hm.
- Eventually.
Thanks, Twy.
There he is, my ginchi hotelier.
How does it feel to be President in the Presidential Suite?
Well, uh, let me say this about that, Moira, Uh, if not now, when, if not us, who.
- Are you alright, John?
- Oh, it's my JFK, just playing into the theme.
Best to leave the voice work to me when setting a mood.
Yeah, so I must admit, Sweetheart, I could get used to this.
I'm going to run a bath, John.
Well, if I close my eyes I can almost hear the orcas calling to be fed - or freed.
-  - Oh.
- Jocelyn, Roland.
- Johnny, Moira.
-  - What's going on here?
- Uh, nothing, nothing.
No we were uh, - just uh, -  doing a final polish on the uh, on the room.
- Uh-huh.
-  Oh, I guess martinis work better than wax, huh?
Johnny, wasn't it you who said it was dangerous to treat your assets like personal possessions?
And what may I ask are you two doing back here?
I told you we would get caught, Roly.
Well if you must know, Jocelyn and I had been renting our extra bedroom to uh, help pay for this place.
Yeah, and so we thought there's nobody here, it might be nice to have a weekend where a total stranger wasn't making themselves at home in my kitchen.
Okay, look Roland, I may have been a bit too much of a stickler earlier.
Ah no, no it's fine, Johnny, we'll just uh, we'll just sleep in the truck with the baby.
Or you know what, you could give us the keys to your place, it would be like wife swap except we wouldn't be swapping wives, - we'd be swapping mattresses.
- Okay, you can take the room.
- It's not gonna happen.
- Oh thank you, guys.
Okay.
Great, thank you.
I've never stayed in a Presidential Suite.
Enjoy it, Honey, this one uh reminds me a lot of the uh, suites in uh Cuba before Castro took over.
- That's not, that's not JFK.
- Yes, it's JFK, he's always Ask a not what your country can do for you.
- Who said that?
- The man's from Boston.
- John!
- He didn't say, no he's not, he's from Upstate New York.
- Coming Moira.
- And FDR said that.
What is all this?
Sit.
Did you close down the whole cafÃ©?
More like I politely but forcefully asked everyone to leave.
So the set menu for tonight is mozzarella sticks, four cheese lasagna, and a blueberry cheesecake for dessert.
Huh, that's a lot of dairy.
All of your cheat day favorites.
Also, I may have forgotten about the whole milk situation.
Well, I appreciate the gesture, Alexis.
So I feel like there's an elephant in the room and I skipped the class that taught us how to care for large mammals and I don't know how to get it to leave.
You can't move back here, Ted, you've just been offered the job of your dreams and there's no turning back now.
And just think of all those gross little flies that are still out there for you to discover.
Actually, those flies are an invaluable piece of the puzzle in the study of evolution, but yes we do have our fingers crossed that there are still a few more out there.
What about you, what are you gonna do?
This might come as a shock to you, Ted, but I can't move to the Galapagos.
I wouldn't let you even if you tried.
You're building something special here, Alexis, and you deserve to see where it takes you.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm so proud of you.
I'd like to think that we helped each other get here.
I know that we did.
And when you get on that plane tomorrow I want you to know how grateful I am to have met you.
I don't think I'm ever gonna meet another woman who made me feel the way that you do.
I'm sure there'll be like some other woman, somewhere.
Can't say that we didn't try.
I love you, Ted.
I love you too.
While I'm far away from you, my baby I know it's hard for you, my baby Because it's hard for me, my baby Because the darkest hour To us.
Is just before dawn - To us.
-
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 Okay, I'm just saying, she broke up with Ted less than a week ago, and I am finding this whole rebound thing to be alarmingly manic, and regressive.
Well, it does sound a little quick.
I mean, has anybody even met this guy?
David, when did you become the Grim Reaper of romance?
Oh.
Alexis!
We were just having the most stimulating conversation about you ganda!
Ugandan politics.
Were you guys waiting up for me?
- Ah!
- N-no!
No, I actually didn't know that you had left.
I was on a date.
Artie took me to the new steakhouse in Elmdale, and it was like, way too expensive, but hey, I'm not the one paying.
"Artie"?
Yeah, I just thought after like, the whole Ted thing, it was healthier for me to just put myself out there.
Anyway, if you'll excuse me, I need to get ready for bed.
I say, bravo, Alexis.
Fling forward!
Ugh!
Hi.
Sorry, wrong room.
Uh, I'm-I'm lookin' for Lexi.
Hmm?
Lexi?
Uh, Alexis.
I call her Lexi.
Well, this is where Lexi lives.
Um, I'm her brother, David, but you can call me Davey.
Hey, how you doin', Davey?
Uh, Lexi left her purse in my car.
Oh!
You're a godsend.
I'll make sure Lexi gets it.
I'm Johnny Rose, I'm Alexis' father.
Arthur Camden, but uh, - you can call me Artie.
- Uh-huh.
Hello, Artie.
Moira Rose.
Lexi's mum.
Very cool.
Uh anyway, I'm gonna shoot Lexi a text.
Yeah, okay.
- Take care.
- You betcha.
Our Lexi is making some wonderful choices.
Okay, so what's the total for the floral arrangement?
Um, I mean, it's hard to get an exact total at the moment, because there are so many variables still in play.
Like you calling the florist, and getting a quote?
- That might be one of them.
- Okay.
Um, Jocelyn has been smiling and waving at me from across the room in a very disturbing way.
I meant to tell you she approached me about uh, working at the Apothecary.
Hmm.
You did tell her "no"?
That it probably wasn't the best fit for our brand identity?
Uh, I told her that I had to talk to you about it.
Look, she's coming over.
Here she is.
Hi, boys.
It looked like you were calling me over.
Did it?
Anywho, um I don't know if Patrick mentioned that we had talked earlier, and he had said that there might be a use for an extra set of hands at the store.
Huh!
Well, I think we're still assessing that at this point.
Well, you let me know when you're done assessing.
I'll be the mother with the baby at home looking for some extra cash, after I invested in your father's business.
I'll be over here.
Okay, that's a lot to unload over brunch.
Yes!
I spent my brunch looking at the classifieds.
There is an opening for a waitress at Bazongas Gentlemen's Club.
I guess I could try that.
I'm sure we can figure something out, Jocelyn.
Right, David?
!
I don't know what's wrong with Bazongas.
But I guess a trial run wouldn't hurt anybody.
There ya go!
Thanks, you guys, oh!
I'll meet you at the store.
I'm just gonna go home and change into something a little more casual.
"More casual"?
Well, look at it this way, David.
Maybe having Jocelyn on staff will give a little extra time to call the florist.
Ohh!
Boy, young people and their phones.
Mm.
Would that be David you're having an online laugh with?
No, it's Arthur.
He's so funny, and he has so many good stories.
Well, I'm sure he does.
When you have that many years under your belt, you're bound to have collected a good story or two.
Yeah.
We're going to the Elm Lake Jazz Festival this afternoon.
Artie loves to scat along with the songs.
- Ah.
- Do you know what scatting is?
I do, not a huge fan.
But uh, since you brought up Arthur, Um, you know, I-I was just thinking of how some people say you shouldn't rush into a new relationship, right after a breakup.
Okay, trust me, it's just totally fun and casual.
Okay, well, casual.
Casual is good.
Casual is uh - exceptionally good.
- Yeah.
Artie's an old soul, and you know how I'm an old soul, so we're just like, two old souls having fun together.
Well, he is an old soul.
I'll give you that.
Uh, if you were guessing, Alexis, uh how old a soul would you say Arthur is?
Artie doesn't care about things like age.
Oh.
Although it is his birthday next weekend, and we were planning a weekend trip to wine country.
A weekend in wine country?
Yeah, his ex-wife owns a vineyard, and his kids and grandkids are gonna be there.
Well, it's sounding uh, less and less casual by the minute.
Okay, chill, Dad!
Hmm!
Oh my God, is he calling me right now?
!
That is so 2001.
Hey, babe.
Yep, you just double-tap on photo with your finger.
Okay.
Oh!
This is so exciting!
- Alright.
- Okay!
Now, I like to approach the customer as if we don't need their business.
Okay, let them wander the store, experience the products.
We're here to help if they have a question.
- Okay.
- Excuse me?
Do you have this in a smaller size?
- We don't, unfortunately.
- Oh.
Although, speaking as someone who uses the body milk on the regs, just had a baby, don't wanna get stretch marks.
Trust me when I say you're gonna wanna go with the larger size, 'cause you'll go through it faster than you think.
Oh, actually, I'm shopping for my daughter.
She just had a baby as well.
Hm, well, take a look around, and let us know if you have any questions.
I say look no further, go with the body milk.
She'll love it, plus it's great for diaper rash.
Okay!
Sold.
Thank you for your help.
I can check you out over here.
Wow, my first sale!
You guys make it look so much harder.
Have a "Rose-y" day!
We won't be doing "Rose-y day".
- No?
- No.
- No?
- No.
- Ohhhhhh!
- Aaah!
Stevie!
Either a flock of poultry has delivered its ova mid-flight upon our car, or I've become the victim of a vandalization!
Oh wow.
Um you sure it's for you, Mrs. Rose?
Because that's a family car, and I can think of a handful of people who'd wanna egg David.
You're sweet, dear, but I know of what I speak.
Stevie, you are blessed with anonymity, and thus will never have to know the crippling fear that accompanies global repute.
Yeah, I can't imagine.
After my first centerfold with Soap Opera Digest, a deranged fan deposited locks of hair into my glove compartment.
And now my return to prominence has painted another giant bulls-eye on my thorax!
Um, I could give you this bucket of soap.
No!
You never tamper with a crime scene.
I'll have to go to council.
Get in please, Stevie.
As of now, you are my star witness.
And sit low, no point endangering both our lives.
Fine.
We're here for brunch, right, and she looks at me and says, you mean, lunner?
I asked her for a bunch menu, and she puts thing, says it's a lunner menu.
- No!
- Lunner!
Alexis, Arthur.
I thought you two were going to a jazz festival?
Oh we were, we just like, popped in for a bite to eat, because Artie's blood sugar is low.
Well, I guess there's enough sugar in mimosas, huh?
Oh, don't worry, I'm over 21, Dad.
Oh my God, I'm laughing my head off.
Well, I'm just gonna grab some lunch.
Um, nice running into you again, Arthur.
Please, Dad, just call me Artie.
Oh.
Well, please don't call me "Dad".
Could I get a coffee, Twyla, please?
So I see Alexis is getting back out there.
Has she told you anything about this guy?
No, but I think he dated my aunt.
I don't know, I was a baby at the time, but there's a photo of him holding me at Christmas.
And I remember that, because that was the year Santa brought me a lighter.
Okay, I'll be right back.
Stay right there.
Excuse me, Twyla.
Arthur, hi, do you mind if I uh, join you for a minute?
No, of course.
Always room at the table for Lexi's old man.
That's a smidge worse than "Dad".
Uh, what do you do for a living?
Well, actually, I am retired.
Yeah, but I used to own um, a chain of trailer parks.
But don't-don't worry, I don't you know, live in a trailer.
I own a beautiful three-bedroom home with an above ground pool, if that's what you're worried about.
No, that wasn't my primary concern, Arthur.
- Oh.
- No, the thing is, as a parent, I can't help but notice there's a bit of an age discrepancy.
Oh!
No, no, we're totally chill with that.
I mean, Lexi's a great girl.
Yes, she is.
Yes, she is.
But um, Arthur, my daughter is in a bit of a vulnerable space right now.
She just got out of a rather serious relationship, a week ago, and she was engaged to him twice.
I'm not entirely sure what she's doing, but uh, you might wanna tread lightly.
Oh understood.
Yeah.
Thanks for the heads up.
Okay.
Uh, Johnny, I I know it isn't always easy being a dad.
And being a grandad's even harder.
Oh, well, maybe you might wanna give me some tips when I eventually get there.
Alright, now you tell me how we're gonna fix this.
Hello, council people!
Why, you ask, are we here, trembling before you?
Well, I'll answer your question.
I was assailed this morning.
- Is that a fact?
- Stone cold.
Stevie was there.
Stevie, describe the carnage.
Um, well, there were a couple of broken eggs on Mrs. Rose's car, and one on the back windshield.
- It was shattered!
- The windshield?
The egg!
That's the bestial level of attack with which we are dealing.
Right, Stevie?
I don't know, you tell me.
Well, you know, after this little interview in People Magazine, I'm surprised those eggs weren't actually thrown at you.
Has it hit the stands?
My publicist is off today.
It sure has.
You describe the town as, and I quote, "the last place you'd ever wanna end up".
Oh no, I described the town as the last place I'd ever want to end up.
Um, since I'm no longer the star witness in this criminal case, can I get back to work?
No, you see here, I'm exaggerating for effect.
And I made sure to never mention the name of your precious borough.
I'm gonna take that as a "yes".
It wasn't hard to figure out, Moira, somebody posted it on the town message board, and now tempers are running hot.
Yeah, Bob was so upset he had to go home.
You know, Moira, this bad press could not have come at a worse time.
We were just about to launch a huge tourism campaign, and now thanks to you, this could be the biggest scandal since we installed the church wheelchair ramp backwards.
Roland, something has to be done!
It's a simple miscommunication.
Do you want Stevie to be cleaning eggs off my car every morning?
!
Moira, you're gonna have to clean up this mess yourself, Okay?
We're spending a lot of money on this campaign, and we can't afford another "ramp-gate".
Why'd you do it?
!
Why'd you do it?
!
Ooh, I think they're here for you, Moira!
Hey uh, folks, I can't quite read those signs, do you mind holding them up a little higher for me, there?
Oh yeah, thanks.
You know what's often more potent than an apology, is an explanation.
You know, I may have said this town is the last place I wish to find myself, but the magazine neglected to include my entire quote.
I specifically commended your ever-beating heart, and your elephantine generosity.
"A slice of heaven," is what I recall myself saying!
Please know that I believe, deep down, there are worse places to be.
Like in your shoes right now.
Would a quick meet and greet help?
I do have a few headshots in the boot of my car.
No, I don't think you need more people knowing which car is yours, Moira, but I do have an idea that I think will solve all our problems.
Okay, but can we discuss it over lunch?
I pre-ordered a tuna sandwich, and those things can turn on a dime.
Oh, allow me to leave you with this.
I solemnly vow to make right by all of you.
As soon as one of you details my car.
Receipt in the bag?
There you go, bye.
I don't wanna rub salt in the wound here, David, but Jocelyn is kinda crushing it.
Okay, I have also had a very active day on the sales floor.
David, she has sold more in one day than we have all week.
And you've spent the better part of the afternoon standing in the corner giving her cut-eye.
I'm mentoring her, and monitoring her progress.
And frankly, it's not moving as fast as I'd like.
Why can't you just admit that she is an asset?
It's probably beginner's luck, like when you walk into a casino and win big on your first pull of the "Basic Instinct" slot machine.
Okay, I'm beginning to think that that is the high point - of your entire life.
- All I'm saying is, I don't necessarily trust the numbers.
Oh.
I had an ex in San Francisco who was a real estate agent, and basically made all of our friends buy penthouses just to make it look like he was doing well.
For all we know, these could just be Jocelyn's friends.
Well, friends or not, that's still a sale.
Yeah, but is that what we're really about?
Like, just selling products?
Yep, that is literally the purpose of our store.
Look, I didn't expect this from Jocelyn either, but clearly, she has a connection to the people of this community, and I say we make the most of it.
Okay, so what, you want to offer her a job?
Well, I think the offer would mean more coming from you.
Another sale, boys!
Where'd she get that bell?
She brought it from home.
Ugh!
Hi honey, everything okay?
Yeah, everything is great.
My life is going like, really, really great right now!
Oh, well, that's uh, that's good.
Here's a fun thing, I just got dumped by a man who wears three medic-alert bracelets.
Really?
He just said out of nowhere that he needs to end things.
Oh, well, that that does seem abrupt.
Wow, well maybe-maybe that's just further confirmation that you know, he he wasn't he wasn't the right person for you?
I know he's not the right person for me.
His taste in makeout music, for example, like, so weird.
Like, who even is Cat Stevens?
!
Well, Cat wrote some wonderful songs, honey.
I'm just looking for like, any distraction from the fact that my heart's shattered into a million pieces.
Like, I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
I'm getting broken up with by gross old men!
Oh, honey, no, he-he-he wasn't that gross.
No, I mean, he-he seemed nice.
He was responsible.
He did run a successful mobile-home business.
How did you know about that?
- What?
- How did you know that?
I-uh, where did I hear that?
You talked to him!
Well, I-I just for I did talk to him.
Brief conversation, but just in passing.
Why would you do that?
I told you that I was in control of the situation.
Well, honey, I don't know whether you were.
I was just trying to help.
Alexis, in the past, I I couldn't always be there for you when you were when you were dealing with heartbreak.
I wasn't there to protect you.
And I guess I was just being a bit overzealous, and trying to make up for lost time.
Well, if you really wanna know, I dated guys like, a whole lot worse than Artie.
Where were you when I was dating half the cast of "White Squall"?
Well, I don't really want to know.
What am I gonna do now?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, cry for a bit.
I wonder when David'll be home.
And, we're closed!
Oh!
It's not the stock market, Jocelyn, but yes, the day is done.
Is it always this busy?
I mean, I feel like when I've been here before, - it's just been me.
- Hmm!
Well, today was a great day for us.
And with that in mind, um David has something that he would like to say.
Two things, actually.
Um, first thing, thought we discussed shelving "have a Rose-y day".
- Ah, people seem to enjoy it.
- Yeah.
And two Patrick and I would like to officially welcome you to the sales staff here at Rose Apothecary.
Oh my gosh!
That is so sweet!
You're welcome.
But I just don't think it's for me.
- Mmm!
- It's not for you?
Yeah, I mean, as David would say, I just don't think it's in my brand.
I don't think I've ever said that.
It's just not for me.
Huh.
So this store is just not for you.
Yeah.
I'd rather take my chances, you know, see if some tutoring gigs come up.
- Tutoring?
- Because that's a a better job than working here?
Well, I find teaching students very fulfilling.
You know, not what you two do here isn't fulfilling, you know, for you, but it's just not fulfilling - For you.
Got it.
- For her.
Yeah, well hey, what whatever you wanna do.
Thank you for the opportunity.
And you guys can keep the bell.
Oh!
The bell!
'Cause you might need it a little more than me.
I'll come by tomorrow to pick up my paycheck.
Okay!
Yeah she does know this is a training session, right?
What does that even mean, "not for her"?
Well, um I think it means our store - It's just not for her?
- It's just not for her.
- I got it.
Thank you.
- I think that's what it means.
Oh, hello, you.
I'm film and television's Moira Rose.
Won't you join me for a little stroll through the slice of paradise I like to call the town where I currently am.
Did someone say fine dining?
The CafÃ© Tropical has certainly been described as "fine".
Oh, hello, Twyla.
I'll have the Miso Black Cod, please.
We don't have that.
You mean, you're sold out, is more like it!
And when it's time to escape the hustle and bustle of the downtown core, you'll find all the peace and solitude your body craves here at our local apothecary.
No noisy customers or busy cash registers here, to intrude upon your inner cogitations.
It's-it's not usually this quiet.
Oh, it's always nice and quiet here.
Can you stop saying that?
And finally, when it's time to lay down your weary head, you'll find comfort and safety at the partially renovated Rosebud Motel.
And don't forget to say hello to your handsome proprietor, Mr. Johnathon Rose.
- Thank you for having us.
- John, no.
So why wait?
Book your vacation now to this humble little oasis.
If heaven had a creek, it would be this one.
