{START OF EPISODE 1}
1    Eleanor?
Come on in.
Hi, Eleanor.
I'm Michael.
How are you today?
I'm great.
Thanks for asking.
Oh, one question.
Where am I?
Who are you?
And what's going on?
Right, so, you, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Your life on Earth has ended, and you are now in the next phase of your existence in the universe.
Cool.
Cool.
I have some questions.
Thought you might.
How did I die?
I-I don't remember.
Yes, um, in cases of traumatic or embarrassing deaths, we erase the memory to allow for a peaceful transition.
Are you sure you want to hear?
All right, so you were in a grocery store parking lot.
You dropped a bottle of something called "Lonely Gal Margarita Mix for One".
And when you bent down to pick it up, a long column of shopping carts that were being returned to the shopping cart collection area rolled out of control and plowed right into you.
Oof.
That's how I died?
No, sorry, there's more.
You were able to grab on to the front of the column of shopping carts, but it swept you right out into the street where you were struck and killed by a mobile billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction pill called "Engorge-ulate".
Funnily enough, the first EMT to arrive was an ex-boyfriend of yours Okay, that's I get it, thank you.
Oh, okay, sorry.
Um, so who was right?
I mean about all of this?
Well, let's see.
Hindus are a little bit right, Muslims a little bit.
Jews, Christians, Buddhists, every religion guessed about 5%, except for Doug Forcett.
Who who's Doug Forcett?
Well, Doug was a stoner kid who lived in Calgary during the 1970s.
One night, he got really high on mushrooms, and his best friend, Randy, said, "Hey, what do you think happens after we die"?
And Doug just launched into this long monologue where he got like 92% correct.
I mean, we couldn't believe what we were hearing.
That's him, actually, right up there.
He's pretty famous around here.
I'm very lucky to have that.
- So -  Maybe my biggest question: am I I mean, is this Or Well, it's not the heaven or hell idea that you were raised on.
But generally speaking, in the afterlife, there's a Good Place and there's a Bad Place.
You're in the Good Place.
-  - You're okay, Eleanor.
You're in the Good Place.
Well, that's good.
Sure is.
Okay, let's take a walk, shall we?
Oh, did I have a purse?
No, I'm dead, right.
Okay.
So this is how it works.
The Good Place is divided into distinct neighborhoods.
Each one contains exactly 322 people who have been perfectly selected to blend together into a blissful harmonic balance.
Do all the neighborhoods look like this?
No, every neighborhood is unique.
Some have warm weather, some cold.
Some are cities, some farmland.
But in each one, every blade of grass, every ladybug, every detail has been precisely designed and calibrated for its residents.
There's a lot of frozen yogurt places.
Yeah.
That's the one thing we put in all the neighborhoods.
People love frozen yogurt.
I don't know what to tell you.
You're gonna have a million more questions, I know.
For right now, better grab a seat.
Movie's about to begin.
- Ah.
Hello, everyone.
- And welcome to your first day in the afterlife.
You were all, simply put, good people.
But how do we know that you were good?
How are we sure?
- During your time on Earth, - every one of your actions had a positive or a negative value, depending on how much good or bad that action put into the universe.
- Every sandwich you ate, - - every time you bought a magazine, - every single thing you did had an effect that rippled out over time and ultimately created some amount of good or bad.
You know how some people pull into the breakdown lane when there's traffic?
And they think to themselves, "Ah, who cares?
No one's watching".
We were watching.
Surprise.
Anyway, when your time on Earth has ended, we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system.
Only the people with the very highest scores, the true cream of the crop, get to come here, to the Good Place.
What happens to everyone else, you ask?
Don't worry about it.
The point is, you are here because you lived one of the very best lives that could be lived.
And you won't be alone.
Your true soul mate is here too.
-  - That's right.
Soul mates are real.
One of the other people in your neighborhood is your actual soul mate, and you will spend eternity together.
So welcome to eternal happiness.
Welcome to the Good Place.
Sponsored by: otters holding hands while they sleep.
You know the way you feel when you see a picture of two otters holding hands?
That's how you're gonna feel every day.
So who is in the Bad Place, that would shock me?
Uh, well, Mozart, Picasso, Elvis, basically every artist ever, uh, every U.S. president except Lincoln.
That sounds about right.
What about Florence Nightingale?
That was close, but, no, she didn't make it.
Wow, all those amazing people down there, it just seems so hard to believe.
Again, it's an incredibly selective system.
Most people don't make it here.
But you, a lawyer who got innocent people off death row, you're special, Eleanor.
And by the way, welcome to your new home.
Oh, it's perfect, isn't it?
You see, in the Good Place, every person gets to live in a home that perfectly matches his or her true essence.
Cool.
So I guess that's why my house, for example, is this adorable little cottage, whereas other people might have homes that are bigger, like that one.
Exactly.
Oh, I'm so happy you get it.
As you can see, the interior has been decorated just as you like it, in the Icelandic primitive style.
Oh, oh, and, uh, of course, you love clowns, so I do love clowns.
Now, let me show you the, uh the video system here.
You can review everything that happened in your life from your point of view.
There we go.
This is your Human Rights mission to the Ukraine.
I mean, you got a ton of points for that one.
It really put you over the top.
Oh.
Chidi, come on in.
Eleanor?
I'm Chidi Anagonye, and you are my soul mate.
Cool, bring it in, man.
Now, excuse me.
I have other people to attend to.
So where you from, Chidi?
Well, I was born in Nigeria, raised in Senegal, but my work took me all over the place Australia, Hong Kong, Paris.
What about you?
Uh, well, I I was born in Phoenix.
- Mm-hmm.
- Arizona.
And then I went to school in Tempe, Arizona.
And then I moved back to Phoenix, Arizona.
Your English is amazing.
Oh!
I'm actually speaking French.
This place just translates whatever you say into a language the other person can understand.
- So it's incredible.
- Whoa.
And now I want to say this.
Mm-kay.
Eleanor.
I have spent my entire life in pursuit of fundamental truths about the universe.
And now we can actually learn about them together as soul mates.
It's overwhelming.
Chidi.
You'll stand by my side no matter what, right?
Of course I will.
Promise me.
Say, "I promise I will never betray you for any reason".
Eleanor, I swear that I will never say or do anything to cause you any harm.
Good.
Because those aren't my memories.
I wasn't a lawyer.
I never went to the Ukraine.
I hate clowns.
There's been a big mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
Wait, what?
Are you sure this isn't you?
Yeah, man, I'm pretty sure I wasn't a death row lawyer who collected clown paintings and rescued orphans.
They got my name right, but nothing else.
I mean, somebody royally forked up.
Somebody forked up.
Why can't I say "fork"?
If you're trying to curse, you can't here.
I guess a lot of people in this neighborhood don't like it, so it's prohibited.
That's bullshirt.
So, uh, if you're not this person, then who are you?
What did you do for a living?
I was in sales.
So we sell two products here, NasaPRO and NasaPRO Silver.
We aim this at seniors.
Now, you can't legally call it medicine because it doesn't technically work and it is technically chalk, so what you're gonna want to do You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake medicine.
I get it, man.
Which one's my desk?
So your job was to defraud the elderly?
Sorry the sick and elderly?
But I was very good at it.
I was the top salesperson five years running.
Okay, but that's worse.
I mean, you you do get how that's worse?
- Right?
- Mm.
You know, maybe it's a test.
Maybe if you go to Michael and you tell him the truth, you'll pass the test and you'll get to stay.
No way.
I can't risk going to the Bad Place.
Okay, well, maybe it's not actually, like, all that bad.
Let's just get some information first.
We'll ask Janet.
Hey, Janet?
- Hi there.
- Gah!
How can I help you?
What the fork?
Who are you?
I'm Janet.
I'm the informational assistant here in the Good Place.
She's like this walking database.
You can ask her about the creation of the universe or history Oh, there was a guy who lived in Avondale, Arizona, around 2002.
His name was Kevin Paltonic.
- Is he gay?
- No.
Really?
Huh.
I guess he just didn't want to have sex with me.
That's correct.
Well, that's fine, I wasn't that into him anyway.
- Yes, you were.
- Okay, Janet, - I have a question.
- Okay.
What is the Bad Place like?
Oh, sorry, that is the one topic I'm not allowed to tell you about.
I can only play you a brief audio clip of what is happening there right now.
Okay.
- The bear has two mouths!
-   Well, it doesn't sound awesome.
Does everyone have a huge house except me?
All right, we need a plan.
I say we just lie low and hope that they don't notice me.
I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you.
I just don't like being dishonest, and I can't advise you to be dishonest either.
Come on, I'm just asking you to fudge a little bit.
You must've told a few white lies in your life.
I mean, what was your job?
I was a professor of ethics and moral philosophy.
Motherforker!
I'm getting a stomachache.
I'm in a perfect utopia, and I'm I have a stomachache.
This is awful.
I-I, uh I think I have to tell Michael about this.
Tell Michael about what?
Michael?
Hi.
What have you been up to?
Eleanor, Chidi, I would like you to meet Tahani and Jianyu.
They are soul mates and your next-door neighbors.
Hello.
Can I just say I love your house?
It's just so tiny and cute.
It's like a little child's plaything, like for a family of mice or for a very fancy little dog.
I love it.
It's just so sweet and teensy.
Just like you.
Boop.
- Oh.
- Oh.
You booped me.
Ha-ha.
- I did.
- That's fun.
Tahani and Jianyu are having a little welcome party tonight, and they've invited the entire neighborhood.
-  - I simply adore entertaining.
Don't I just adore it, Jianyu?
Oh, um, yes, by the way, Jianyu here is a Buddhist monk, you see?
And he obeys a strict code of silence.
So when you see him smiling and nodding, that's actually his way of jumping up and down with glee.
Isn't that right, darling?
So we'll see you tonight?
- Great.
- Yes.
-  - No way.
My entire house could fit in this room.
Okay, uh help me out here.
Tell me one good thing that you did on Earth, just one truly kind and decent act so that I can feel better about helping you out.
Let's forget about good.
Um, just tell me something neutral about yourself.
Like, tell me about the day before you died.
What do you remember?
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
Do you have a second to eat my farts?
You missed.
Pick it up if you're so horny for the environment.
I don't remember anything specific.
- Oh.
- Look.
I might not have been a saint, but it's not like I killed anybody.
I wasn't an arsonist.
I never found a wallet outside of an IHOP and thought about returning it but saw the owner lived out of state so just took the cash and dropped the wallet back on the ground.
Okay, that's really specific, and that makes me think that you definitely did do that.
All I'm saying is these people might be "good," but are they really that much better than me?
Well, I spent half my life in North Korea fighting for women's rights and the other half in Saudi Arabia fighting for gay rights.
So we said, "If the U.N. won't remove those land mines, we will".
And we dug up over a thousand unexploded land mines from the area surrounding the orphanage.
Well, then he said, "You can't give me both your kidneys; you'll die".
And I said, "But you will live".
And I know we just met on this bus ten minutes ago, but he seemed nice.
Oh, forget it.
Heading to the bar!
Thank you, thank you.
You all know that I am the architect of this neighborhood.
But what you don't know is Golly, I'm not supposed to tell you this, but, um, oh, what the heck?
This is actually the very first neighborhood that I have ever designed.
I had been an apprentice for over 200 years, and my boss has finally given me my first solo project.
-  - Yes!
Ah, gah-gah gah-gah-gah.
Hold on there, ace.
Let me get more of them shrampies.
- Okay, easy.
- What?
They're for everybody, right?
Yes, exactly.
And you deserve a perfect world because every single one of you is a good person.
That's it for me.
Back to you, Tahani.
- Bravo, Michael, bravo!
- Thank you.
Um, and I would just like to quickly say if any of you would like to play tennis tonight, we have 36 regulation grass tennis courts.
Such fun.
Cheers.
Tahani, what a condescending bench.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Am I right?
Why does she still have that British accent, right?
No one else here has an accent.
She's choosing to have that accent.
- Shh-shh-shh-shh.
-  "Oh, hello.
"I am just a big, beautiful, utterly perfect cartoon giraffe".
Oh, okay.
Okay.
- I think it's time to go home.
-  Wait, wait, wait.
I just have to go upstairs real quick and steal a bunch of gold stuff.
Okay, don't do that.
Don't do no, Eleanor, Eleanor, Eleanor.
Hello, creepy house that I hate.
Hello, one million clowns.
Why aren't there stairs here?
What kind of weirdo house is this?
Ooh.
Did you fill your bra with shrimp?
No.
Yes.
Whatever, it's freakin' heaven.
I'm sure they have plenty of shellfish.
That Tahani is a real butthead, huh?
Hey.
At least I can still say "butthead".
She is a butthead.
Found some pajamas.
Chidi Chidi, Chidi?
I'm sorry that you had to deal with this It's okay.
It's not, though.
Do you think anybody cared that I died?
Maybe someone did.
I don't know.
I was an only child.
My parents were divorced when I was a kid.
They were both crummy people, so they're probably  in the Bad Place.
Maybe they're being used to torture each other.
It would work.
I bet way more people cared that you died.
'Cause you're a nice person.
You're a nice person, Chidi Anaconda.
Anagonye.
Aganocomonga.
Anagonye.
- Ags say it again.
- Anagonye.
No, say what you said before.
I did.
It's Anagonye.
You just changed it.
I didn't change it; it's my name.
Argrugande.
Ariana Grande.
That's a person.
I did it.
Good night.
Good night.
Well, that's terrifying.
That can't be good.
I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more Oh, fork.
The part when I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before This is the part When I break free 'Cause I can't resist it no more - Michael.
- Mm?
Is that giant, terrifying ladybug supposed to be there?
Ah, well, great question, Tahani.
No.
No, it's not.
I have no idea why any of this is happening or how to control it.
Should we run away then?
Yes.
It was lethal - Righto.
- It was fatal In my dreams, it just felt so right But I woke up every time Ooh, baby This is the part When I say I don't want ya I'm stronger than I've been before Chidi, Chidi!
What's going on?
Why are there giant animals everywhere?
Do you hear Ariana Grande playing?
Why is everyone wearing blue and yellow?
You're not.
You're you're the only one who's not.
Eleanor, this is all happening because of you.
Ah, fork me.
Okay, okay.
We don't know this is because of me.
Eleanor, this place is a perfectly made Swiss watch, and you are a wrench in the gears.
Actually, you're a hammer, just smashing the gears into dust.
Oh, hang on.
Not everybody here is perfect, okay?
Tahani is totally condescending.
And there are a couple of, you know, chunksters.
Oh, come on!
No judgment.
I'm just saying I'm not the only one with flaws.
So how can we be sure this is my fault?
You hogged all the shrimp, and now there are shrimp flying around.
You called Tahani a giraffe, and now there are giraffes everywhere.
Okay, fine, turns out there are many ways to know that it was me.
Let's just face it, Eleanor, you don't belong here.
Well, then this system sucks.
What, one in a million gets to live in paradise and everyone else is tortured for eternity?
Come on.
I mean, I wasn't freaking Gandhi, but I was okay.
I was a medium person.
I should get to spend eternity in a medium place!
Like Cincinnati.
Everyone who wasn't perfect but wasn't terrible should get to spend eternity in Cincinnati.
Look, apparently it doesn't work that way.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but there's nothing anyone can do.
Unless there is something we can do.
Unless you could teach me.
Teach you what?
How to be good.
That was your job, right?
A professor of ethics?
No one knew I was a problem when I arrived.
Things only started getting crazy after I was an ash-hole to everyone at the party.
You know I'm trying to say "ash-hole" and not "ash-hole," right?
I got that, yes.
Okay, give me a chance.
Let me earn my place here.
Let me be your ethical guinea pig.
Hey, guys!
Uh, emergency neighborhood meeting, now!
We'll be right there, Michael!
If I walk out of here in these clothes, I'm toast.
My soul is in your hands, soul mate.
What's it gonna be?
Oh, stomachache.
I, uh I don't know what to do here.
This is a mess, morally speaking.
This is a putrid, disgusting bowl of ethical soup.
Okay, well how about we just chill and go to the town meeting and talk it out after?
- W - Great.
Hey, how do I make that helper woman show up?
Hello?
Front desk lady?
Magical slave robot?
Excuse me, Janet?
- Hi there.
-  Gah still not used to it.
Um, Janet, I need quick question: can anyone access our search history, or is this an incognito browsing situation like when you're stalking a hot male man from your work computer?
It is 100% confidential.
No one can access what you ask me, including Michael.
Now, what kind of pornography would you like to see?
No.
No, no, no, not porn.
I, um I need clothes like yours and Chidi's with the stripes.
There you go.
Everybody, everybody!
Uh, gather round, please, thank you, thank you.
Obviously, there's something very wrong with this neighborhood.
We don't know what it is, how long it will last, or what caused it.
What do we know, Janet?
We know where it happened.
Here.
Yes, thank you, Janet.
The chaos happened here.
See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems.
One little flaw can lead to well, it can lead to Gary over there.
Hey, Gary.
Hang in there, buddy.
Boy, my armpits are leaking.
What is that called again?
- Sweat.
- Right, right.
Still not used to being in a human body.
And what do you do with sweat?
Do do you lick it away, is that right?
No, you dab it with a cloth.
Oh, right.
And then you lick the cloth?
That seems weirder.
Michael.
Look!
Okay.
That's a good sign.
It it could mean that this is almost over.
Oh, such a relief.
That was my first time as a fashion "don't," and I did not care for it.
Okay, I think it is time to make me good, partner.
How do we do it?
Is there a pill I can take or something I could vape?
Where did you get a chalkboard?
It's the Good Place; you can get anything you want at any time.
And you chose a chalkboard?
What are you reading?
"The Metaphysics of Morals" by Immanuel Kant.
It's a treatise on the aesthetic preconditions of the mind's receptivity to duty.
A book on how to act good.
Oh, great!
So you've decided to help me?
I don't know.
There's a thousand questions.
Is there a moral imperative to help you?
Do I have a greater obligation to my community?
Are you taking someone else's spot, someone who deserves to be here?
Ooh, on that question, I honestly think I was just put here by mistake.
Because Michael called me Eleanor Shellstrop, so he knows I'm me.
He's just wrong about my overall "quality" level.
Please, help me, man.
I swear I am worth it.
Tell me one fact that you know about me.
I mean, we spent the whole day together.
You must remember something.
What country am I from?
Is it racist if I say Africa?
Yes, and Africa is not a country.
I am from Senegal.
Do I have any siblings?
Where did I go to college?
Trick question.
You didn't.
I was literally a college professor.
Do you not remember one single thing about me?
Dude, things have been nuts around here.
I bet you don't know anything about me.
You were born in Phoenix.
You went to school in Tempe.
You're an only child.
Your favorite show is something called "The Real Housewives of Atlanta," and your favorite book is Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
How did you know all that?
Because you are constantly talking about yourself.
You are the most self-obsessed person I have ever met.
You should see Kendall Jenner's Instagram feed.
Okay, this is my fear about you, Eleanor.
You are too selfish to ever be a good person.
Well, I think you're wrong.
What country am I from, again?
Sen sodyne.
That is a brand of toothpaste.
Look, the only thing that you are concerned with is your own happiness.
That's your problem.
Okay, names in the hat.
Time to pick a designated driver.
And the loser is Betsy.
Wait, you never get picked, and you're always the one who draws the name.
- Let me see that.
- There's no need.
Everyone here believes in my integrity 100%, right, guys?
Give it to me.
For the record, I did that out of principle, because it absolutely had your name on it.
If I check the other ones, I can figure it out by process of elimination.
All right, everyone, let's get started.
Things have settled down.
Whew!
So hopefully, we're off and running.
Welcome to orientation, day two.
Now, today we're gonna start with something that everyone has always wanted to do.
Flying.
Now that you're dead, let's live a little, right?
Uh, sorry.
Uh, Michael?
If if I might?
I was just thinking, earlier today in all of the chaos, large swaths of this neighborhood were destroyed.
We thought perhaps some of us could, uh, volunteer to help clean up the debris.
You know, it's quite a fun way to band together as a community, isn't that right, Jianyu?
Oh, uh, yeah, sorry.
For those of you who don't know, my soul mate, Jianyu here, is a Buddhist monk.
He took a vow of silence that he's still observing, even here, in the Good Place.
It's truly inspiring.
Well, Tahani, it's not really your job to clean up, but I suppose there's no harm if you really want to.
Oh, well, hurrah.
We need about, uh, 12 volunteers.
Oh!
I can't believe all these people are passing on flying to pick up garbage all day.
Have fun, nerds.
I'll be soaring through the air like a forkin' bird.
Eleanor and I would love to help.
Ah, hurrah-hurrah, yay.
Dude.
You want to prove you're not selfish?
Here's the perfect test.
There's something fun that you want to do, and then there's something less fun that people are doing for the common good.
Which do you choose?
Have fun.
Whoo!
- Hey!
-  Yeah!
Whee!
Hey, up there, having fun, or does it maybe suck, probably?
I'd say it's like 50 million simultaneous orgasms, but better.
How's volunteer garbage pickup?
- About the same.
- Great!
Whee!
You know, this really reminds me of my time in Vietnam, picking up mortar shells with my godmother, Diana.
Doesn't really matter of what she's a princess of.
It's not really important.
Tahani!
How goes the cleaning?
Oh, swimmingly, Michael.
And I have to say this neighborhood that you've built is truly a masterpiece, the likes of which I've never seen.
And I've been to Johnny Depp's private bird sanctuary.
Well, thank you.
That's very kind of you to say.
But it's also dead wrong.
This neighborhood is a disaster.
See, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
And it led to all this chaos, and now I'm just I'm just terrified that it's gonna happen again.
I'm trying to put a good face on well, this this face that I've constructed for myself.
But the truth is, I I'm just miserable.
I have to go.
Thank you so much for your service.
Oh, no.
Powerful people do not handle failure well.
Michael could be heading for a total meltdown.
Soul mate, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Should we say it at the same time?
All right.
One, two, three.
We must help Michael.
Oh, you sly devil.
You're going to keep me on my toes, aren't you?
All right, come on.
Let's go.
- Oh.
- Ooh.
Hey, Gunnar!
Hey, Antonio!
Hey, Eleanor.
- Isn't this great?
- Um, yeah.
When I thought of the afterlife, I totally pictured being an unpaid, non-flying janitor.
Us too!
You guys are so fun.
Just relentlessly fun.
I keep thinking, "When are they gonna stop being fun"?
And the answer is never.
- You're never gonna stop.
-  Well, I have had a pretty full day of being unselfish.
I've made some new friends.
My area's almost garbage-free.
So you're gonna help me figure out how to stay, right?
Well, that is a really tough question.
Most great philosophers would say helping you is pointless, that you can't try to be good, especially when your motivations are so obviously corrupt.
Yeah, but what do most great philosophers know?
On the other hand, Aristotle thought that moral virtue is something that you could get better at.
He he compared it to playing the flute.
The more you practice, the more you improve.
Aristotle!
That's my boy, right there.
He was the best.
I mean, most people agree he was the best one.
So it sounds to me like you are on board the "help Eleanor" train.
Well, I've narrowed it down to two possibilities: yes and no.
Well, no worries.
Just hit me up when you're done weighing my life in your hands.
I'll just keep doing what I do best: being super considerate and selfless.
Hey, guys.
Okay, Eleanor, reminder.
We switched to a rotating system for choosing a designated driver, and it's your turn.
Got it.
Full disclosure, I forgot we were doing this new system.
I got off work early.
I've been here for about an hour, and I'm already pretty drunk.
Someone else will do it.
Good call.
Guess the only place I'll be driving is through the giant loophole in the system I accidentally discovered.
Beep!
Beep!
Whoo!
- Whoa!
-  I can't believe they've managed to mix one million flavors together, and yet, somehow, I can taste each individual one.
It's remarkable.
I got no-flavor.
- It's all I deserve, really.
- No.
Look, I I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
I really do, but you don't understand.
This was the very first neighborhood that I got to design.
It was my chance to prove myself, and now I've blown it.
You know, sometimes a flaw can make something even more beautiful, like with Cindy Crawford and how short she is.
Oh, Tahani, if I made one tiny mistake in my design, if there's a single glitch in the system, if even one blade of grass is angled a a fraction of a degree off  The whole neighborhood is compromised.
Whose dog is that?
Guys, whose dog is that?
Whose dog is that?
See, this is one of those glitches I was talking about.
Nice try, puppy!
Whew!
That was a close one.
Teacup?
Hey, have you seen my dog?
Shouldn't these be magical trash bags?
Five more minutes, flyers!
Five more minutes!
Oh, man, really?
Janet, I'm finished with cleanup, and I'm ready to fly.
- How do I start?
- Hop on the launch pad and conjure an image that brings you pure joy.
Some people think of their wedding day or favorite vacation spot.
People puking on roller coasters.
People puking on roller coasters.
It's working!
Ow!
What the fork?
Janet, any chance this is a scheduled trash storm?
So here's the situation, Pevita.
I kind of kicked your dog into the sun.
But I got her back.
-  - Everything everything seems fine.
Teacup, thank goodness you're okay.
Everyone, it is merely a construct of a dog.
It feels no pain or joy or love.
Teacup doesn't love me?
Oh!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, it definitely feels love.
Do you actually want a dog that loves you a little bit more?
Because I can kick her right back into the sun and get you another one just like that.
- No!
- Oh, boy.
I'm making things worse.
Okay, all right, that's all right.
Breathe.
Breathe do you breathe?
- Mm-hmm.
- If you do, then just breathe 'cause everything's fine, Michael, it's fine.
Ooh!
It's raining garbage.
Run!
Ooh, ooh, no, no, no, I'm gonna run this way.
Chidi!
Hey.
Before you say anything That's it, I just don't want you to say anything.
- What did you do?
- Nothing!
It just started raining trash out of nowhere for no reason at all.
-  -  Oh okay, fine, fine.
My bag broke, and I ditched the trash instead of taking it all the way to the dumpster.
But in my defense, there were only five minutes left in flying and I wanted to go flying.
How is that a defense?
You made a bad choice.
I made a bad choice?
We could have literally been flying, and all you wanted to do was talk about morals.
I mean, you're like the worst part of Superman.
This is a relief.
I can stop my deliberations.
You're a selfish person, and it is pointless to help you.
You are on your own.
Oh, man.
How 'bout this trash storm, Gunnar?
More cleaning up to do.
It's a it's a dream come true.
We're okay!
You can't die here.
Come on, I mean, even you have to admit, those guys are psycho.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I mean, it's my duty to be calm and in control and I'm falling apart.
No, Michael, you are a paragon of fortitude.
You're a mountain of strength.
I'm not a mountain of strength.
I'm a canyon full of poo-poo.
Jianyu, the architect of this neighborhood has just referred to himself as a canyon full of poo-poo.
Surely now, you will say something?
Grace us with your vocalized wisdom.
Please, I'm begging you.
Oh.
Yes, yes, I understand.
The strength is inside me.
It's been there all along.
No, of course, I can overcome any obstacle.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu, thank you.
I'm back.
You did it.
Oh, you have so much to teach me.
Maybe I should try to be silent too.
No really, look.
Here I go.
Oh!
That was wonderful!
So cleansing.
Just water tonight, huh?
Designated driver?
Yeah, it sucks.
I think it's awesome.
I mean, someone's got to do it, right?
I think it's a cool thing to do for people.
Yeah.
No no, I meant I meant I it sucks that I can't do it more often, you know?
I actually prefer it to drinking.
Staying sober and knowing my friends will get home safe, that's my buzz.
Hey, guys, good news and bad news.
See that hot bartender over there?
He's into me, and we're gonna bang it out.
The bad news is, it means I can't drive you guys home.
But I did call a cab for you guys.
But they recognized my number, and they didn't want to come.
I've thrown up in a lot of cabs.
So are we good here?
Eleanor, you have a very important choice to make.
If you blow us off, you are banned from Thursday night drinks forever.
Yeah, I'm good with that.
I'll see you guys at work.
Peace!
You, let's go.
Hey.
How did you know I was here?
I saw you from my window.
That's where I live, by the way.
Not that you ever asked.
What are you doing?
I went to all the places where I dumped trash earlier and cleaned it up so it couldn't be traced back to me.
Well, it looks like you cleaned up everything.
You're doing this because you feel bad.
And you're not even doing it to get me to help you anymore because I told you that's not gonna happen.
Okay, yeah, fine, I felt bad for stupid Gunnar and stupider Antonio and the whole neighborhood.
I felt bad about what I did.
It was a weird feeling.
Not used to it.
Didn't love it.
Well, feeling remorse about being wrong isn't as good as just doing something right, but it's a start.
Look, I think you're capable of change.
And I will help you try.
Oh, wow, man, I swear I won't let you down.
Hi there.
I've collected the worst-smelling garbage that I could find.
Do you still want me to dump it inside of Antonio's house?
What?
No.
I did not tell you to do that.
You are loco, girlfriend.
Okay, I won't let you down starting now.
Ah, Eleanor.
- Good morning.
- Michael.
Do you know what the best part about this place is?
You figured out how to make a to-go cup that doesn't leak right where the seam meets the lid.
Oh, I'm so glad you noticed.
I was very proud of that.
One of the hardest problems I had to solve.
Eleanor, I know what you did.
Cleaning up the entire neighborhood by yourself.
I knew you were special, but this is proof.
Enjoy your coffee.
And the cup.
Okay, let's begin your "good person" lessons.
You got a long way to go to pull this off.
It will take hours and hours of studying ethics and moral philosophy.
We're gonna have assignments and quizzes and papers.
It's gonna be so much fun.
Remind me what I'm getting out of this again.
You get to avoid eternal damnation.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Hey, I got you a present.
What?
Senegal.
That's not a present; that's just common decency.
Yeah, but I forkin' nailed it.
Good talk.
Ah, shirt.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 3}
So Aristotle was Plato's student.
And Aristotle believes that your character - is voluntary, - because it's just the result of your actions, which are under your control.
For example, right now, you have made the insane choice to ignore the person who is literally trying to save you from eternal damnation.
No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm listening.
Uh, I just are we sure we should be paying attention to these guys?
It's like, who died and left Aristotle in charge of ethics?
Plato.
Uh, coming!
Uh, we're just kissing.
And groping?
What?
Hello.
Tahani.
Hi.
What brings you here?
You know, I was just, uh, in the neighborhood.
Do you get it, Eleanor?
Because, you know, we're all in the same afterlife, so, you know, I'm always in the neighborhood.
Do you get it?
And I do, and it's delightful.
Anyway, this is for you.
Just a housewarming plant.
It's a little reminder that if there's ever anything that you need, I am right next door.
How could I possibly forget?
Have a great day, Tahani!
Oh, all right.
Ugh.
Tahani.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Even though we all arrived here at the same time, here's some dirt I put in a bowl because I'm amazing.
I thought it was kind of a nice gesture.
Oh, Chidi.
It's a total con.
I see through her little act.
Her act of being a nice person who brings you gifts?
- Bingo.
- Okay.
I'll I'll remind you that you're trying to learn how to be a good person.
Maybe you should return the favor and bring her something.
Oh, so now I'm supposed to be nice and make friends - and treat her with mutual respect?
- Yeah.
That exactly what she wants me to do, Chidi, wake up!
That that's what everyone wants everyone to do.
Hello, Chidi.
No frozen yogurt for you this morning?
Oh, uh, no, just, uh, doing some reading.
Ugh, been there, brother.
Workin' hard or hardly workin', am I right?
Hump day.
Uh, sorry.
Janet's functioning as my assistant, but she's a little stiff, so I've been trying to get her to be a little more casual and conversational.
I'll have what she's having.
It's a work in progress.
Listen, Chidi.
I've been studying your file.
You're a very interesting case.
You essentially only did one thing while you were on earth.
You thought and wrote about ethics.
Yes, I spent 18 years working on my manuscript called "Who We Are and Who We Are Not colon "Practical Ethics and Their Application in the Modern World semi-colon a Treatise" Yes, yes, yes, that's the one.
That's the one.
I think you should experience new adventures.
You know, do things that you haven't done on earth, right?
So why don't we meet tomorrow and try out some new hobbies.
Uh, why not?
I'll I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Not if I see you first.
Where's the beef?
- I don't know.
- Hump day.
Hello, Eleanor.
Jianyu, darling, look, it's Eleanor from next door.
Is he asleep?
Yeah, there's really no way to tell.
Come on in.
What brings you to our home, my dear?
Well, I'm simply repaying your kind gift with a housewarming gift of my own.
Fresh pears.
It's a plant, just like your gift, but you can actually eat them.
So maybe it's a better gift.
- Who's to say?
- That's so kind.
However, in, um, Chinese culture, pears are actually a symbol of bad luck.
And and I wouldn't want to offend Jianyu, so I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw these in the garbage.
But do come and sit down.
We haven't even had a chance to discuss all of the mayhem in our neighborhood yet.
- It's so disconcerting.
- Yes.
What do you think is causing it?
Oh, I'm sure I don't know.
But we must keep our heads up.
In fact, tomorrow I'm actually going door-to-door to make sure that every single person in this entire neighborhood is keeping calm and carrying on.
'Cause I think that helping others will make me feel like I truly belong here, you know?
Here's a brainstorm, why don't I go with you?
I mean, I would love to do my part to help the neighborhood, not to mention, get a little bonding time with you, lady.
Oh, hurrah!
Such fun.
I'm telling you, Tahani's out to get me.
What are you talking about?
This note was slipped under my door yesterday.
It has to be Tahani.
She just said to me, "I want to feel like I truly belong here".
Well, where have I seen the word "belong" recently?
Oh yeah, kaplow!
I really don't think she's the type of person who would write this.
She is that kind of person and she did write it.
She wants everybody to think she's such a perfect princess just 'cause she's tall and glamorous and has cappuccino skin and curves everywhere and now I'm complimenting her.
And kind of turned on.
The point is, she straight up sucks, bro.
- Whoa.
- Typical Tahani.
Brings us a faulty plant so she can brag about being a better gardener.
No, I think this is another way in which your negative actions affect this world.
This plant represents your relationship to Tahani, so when you're mean to her, it starts to wilt.
Well, then this plant is doomed, because tomorrow, I'm going with her and I'm gonna prove to you and to everyone that she is secretly a two-faced, calculating, phony bench.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Truth hurts, doesn't it, plant?
So all I want to do is just check in, see how everyone's holding up.
Just bring some cheer to these extraordinary people.
Cool.
So tell me about yourself.
I mean, I want to hear it all, girlfriend.
The good, the bad, the really bad, the embarrassing, the humiliating, just let's bond!
Okay, well I was born in Pakistan, raised in London, schooled in Paris, but I think the primary reason that I'm in the Good Place is that I raised quite a lot of money for non-profit groups.
Oh.
Did you ever, uh, skim a little off the top for yourself?
Gracious, no, no!
Every penny was accounted for.
And as I raised nearly $60 billion, there was quite a lot of pennies.
But I also dabbled in some other professions.
I was a model, a museum curator, an "It Girl," and oh, I was Baz Luhrmann's muse for a while.
That was quite fun.
Modeling?
That's a crazy life.
Want to tell me about that rock bottom you probably hit?
Oh, I didn't really do it for long.
Couture just doesn't fit my body.
I'm cursed with ample bosom.
And yet you soldier on.
Oh, this is silly so "Tahani" means "congratulations" in Arabic.
And "Al-Jamil" means "beautiful," so my full name altogether means "Congratulations, Beautiful".
Thanks, Eleanor.
You big flirt.
Hey, babe, got you coffee.
Oh, great.
Oh, Andy's Coffee, uh, we shouldn't go there.
Everybody's boycotting.
Yeah, I know that one guy found a scorpion in his latte.
I don't really care, though, 'cause it's so close to here.
No, no, no, it's because he's sexually harassing people.
Look, a journalist went undercover for an interview and recorded him.
Here, watch.
Here's the thing, sweetheart.
You're very qualified, but you're also what we call in the coffee shop game a, uh, "dog-face".
You're a three, and you have to be a nine to work here.
It's just math.
So I didn't get the job?
No, dog-face, you didn't get the job.
All right, I'll check your references.
- Just to be nice - Hey, my breasts!
I'll check 'em.
Oh, they're good.
Honk!
I mean, this guy's a monster, we can't support this guy.
Okay, hey, you're not better than me just 'cause you won't support a guy who grabbed a boob once.
No, I'm just saying we shouldn't go there.
We can get coffee somewhere else.
Did you know your left reference is a little bit bigger than your right reference?
It's not a bad thing, it's just it's a thing.
This is the perfect hobby for you, Chidi.
Cartography.
Your neighborhood stretches way beyond what you've already seen.
And you can map it, revealing all of the mysteries, like an explorer.
I see how that might be fun.
Uh, but, uh, exploring makes me nervous.
I have what doctor's call "directional insanity".
I once got lost on an escalator.
So not exactly Christopher Columbus.
Fun fact: Columbus is in the Bad Place because of all the raping, slave trade, and genocide.
The fact that it makes you nervous is exactly why you should do it.
You know, get out of your comfort zone.
Become a trail-blazer.
Fun fact: all deceased members of the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team are also in the Bad Place.
Yeah, sorry about this.
I steered her away from colloquialisms and into "fun facts" and trivia tidbits.
I thought it'd be more in her wheelhouse.
Fun fact: a "wheelhouse" is a part of a boat.
Okay, thank you, Janet, thank you.
Fun fact: Janet is me.
All right, let's forget about exploring.
Plenty more ideas for hobbies.
Let's walk back to town, shall we?
- Wrong way.
- Yep.
Well, Glenn, we just wanted to make sure you were all right.
Tahani, you're too sweet.
Isn't she just the nicest person?
Mm-hmm.
That is what a lot of people are saying.
Oh, everyone I know is saying that.
Yeah, it's just a big neighborhood full of enormous mansions and people who love Tahani!
Eleanor and I just want to see if there's anything we can do to help you.
Oh, Tahani, you are so thoughtful.
Despite all the chaos earlier, we simply couldn't be happier.
Oh, I'm so glad to hear it, Cualli.
Please take a maple butter scone.
I made them fresh this morning.
Oh, they look a bit burned.
But they're not.
Hmm.
Oh, fork, that's good.
Extra, extra!
Read all about you.
Chidi, this is the perfect hobby for you.
- Journalism.
- Well, obviously, I like to write.
But I don't love deadlines.
I prefer to take my time with things.
Yes, I know.
Uh, you never even named your dog, did you?
When it ran away, you posted signs saying, "responds to long pauses".
Look, Chidi, I'm just trying to find you a hobby the hat that will bring you a positive experience.
What do you say?
I'm loving that hat on you.
It would look even better on my floor.
What is happening now?
I suggested she be friendlier; she seems to have slipped right into overt sexuality.
I got something you can slip into.
- Oh - Janet, no!
No, Janet.
Oh, Jianyu, darling, would you like some tea?
That nod meant no, apparently.
Well, it was nice to get out and meet all of our wonderful neighbors.
They all truly belong here.
Oh, yes they do, cutie-pants.
Boop!
Well, I should really be going.
I have to begin my 12 step Korean skincare regiment, but, uh, I'll see oh, no, no, no.
Please stay and enjoy the evening tea.
I'll see you soon.
Boop!
"The Diary of Tahani Al-Jamil".
Okay.
Arc welding.
You could learn sculpture, you can make furniture, you can get your hands a little greasy, you know, and you make things.
This equipment is very scary!
Don't be a baby.
It can't hurt you.
Watch, I'll blowtorch your face off.
- Janet.
- Whatever.
This whole thing is stupid.
Oh, brother.
I told her to be less flirty and now she's cruel and distant, apparently.
I just can't get this right.
Thank you for trying to find me a new hobby.
Um, but I just want to be an academic.
I want to keep working on my manuscript.
Chidi, here's the thing see, I read your whole book, all 3,600 pages of it.
It's, um how shall I put this?
It's a mess, dude.
- Hey!
- She's right.
You see, Chidi, I can read the entirety of the world's literature in about an hour.
This took me two weeks to get through.
I mean, it's so convoluted, I just kept reading the same paragraph over and over again, trying to figure out what the heck you were saying.
Oh, no.
I mean, on page 1,000, you start section two with the sentence, "Of course, the exact opposite might be true".
You're a brilliant guy, Chidi.
But you just kept revising and rewriting and adding words to your title.
I think you just twisted yourself up into a knot.
I have a very bad stomachache.
Hey, man.
What's wrong?
Am I a good teacher?
Am I clear?
Do I make sense?
Yeah, you're a great teacher.
I'm super ethical now.
- What's that?
- Hmm?
Nah don't worry about it.
I stole Tahani's diary.
So I could see if her handwriting matches the note and also read about all the mean and terrible things she's definitely done so I can prove she's actually evil.
Huh.
What do you think that means?
You stole Tahani's diary.
I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason.
Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things.
And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule.
I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?
First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.
Why would you even know that?
Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.
- She wrote that note.
- No she didn't!
You did!
I was hoping you would come to this conclusion on your own, but, obviously, no one here would ever threaten you.
That note is the Good Place manifesting your own guilt.
Like with the plant, or when you literally made giant shrimp fly through the air.
I wrote myself the note.
And as it turns out, I do belong here.
Because I'm just as good as everyone else.
No, no, no.
No, you don't belong here.
And in this place, everyone is better than you.
It has been proven by an infallible formula.
Tahani might be a little British and condescending at times, but she devoted her entire life to helping other people.
She's a good person.
Accept that.
Hey, babe.
Great news, I got us tickets to the Coyotes game.
- Awesome!
- But, ooh, yikes.
Turns out two of the players have DUIs.
Guess we can't cheer for that team.
- Eleanor, I - You know what?
Instead, let's just stay in, watch a Roman Polanski movie, listen to R. Kelly, and eat Chik-fil-A.
Does that sound good?
There's bad stuff everywhere, man.
It's impossible to avoid.
Yeah, but shouldn't we just try?
Shouldn't we just try to do the right thing whenever we can?
Why?
It's so much harder to live like that.
And it's not like someone's keeping score.
Look, I know you're gonna break up with me, okay?
I'm not an idiot.
I read your emails to your dad.
Have fun being so amazing and perfect until you die.
And by the way, I'm talking really fast because I still go to Andy's Coffee, and I got a full punch card, bro.
Good people make me insecure.
When I'm around someone who I think is better than me, I try and drag them down to my level.
That's why perfect Tahani is like my kryptonite.
Well, even admitting that is an important step.
And also, maybe don't listen to me.
I would love not to listen to you.
Wait, what?
Basically, my life's work is 3,600 pages of garbage.
Even Michael couldn't understand it.
So?
- What does Michael know?
- Everything.
That's my point he knows everything, and it was too convoluted, even for him.
Michael does not know everything.
Michael does not know I'm not supposed to be here.
You wrote 4,000 pages on one of the most complicated subjects in the world.
I mean I used to get bored halfway through writing a text message.
Be proud.
I want to broaden my horizons and try new things, and I will.
But even though I might have gotten lost in the weeds, I loved writing this book.
And I want to try again.
So will you be my advisor?
Chidi, all I want is for you to be happy.
So if spending eternity getting blunt feedback on your circular, rambling ideas will make you happy, then of course I will be your advisor.
Let's throw that monstrosity in the trash and start over.
Aren't there maybe some parts worth salvaging?
Honestly, man, I don't even know.
I mean, that thing is unreadable.
I literally learned what headaches were because that thing gave me a headache.
Okay.
There you go.
New beginnings!
Well done.
Oh!
Oh, hello, Eleanor.
Hi.
Sorry, I was just cleaning up.
You okay?
Do you want to talk about it?
Desperately.
It's Jianyu.
I just can't seem to connect with him.
I know that he took a vow of silence, but he won't even talk to me, his soul mate!
And I adore talking.
I know.
You do.
Eleanor, you don't know what it's like to be in paradise and feel like there's something just not quite right.
Well I may not know exactly what you're feeling, but I do understand.
And you deserve to be happy, because you are an impressive, thoughtful, and special person.
Not to mention - you have a rockin' bod.
-  I mean, Jianyu may be mute, - but he's not blind.
-  You two belong here.
And you belong together.
And you have all of eternity, so there's plenty of time for things to change.
Oh, thank you.
I really needed to hear that.
Come here.
Ugh, of course your hugs are amazing.
Stupid ledge.
Ugh, stairs.
Everyone here is really into hugging.
Looks like someone learned something.
Well, it's 'cause someone else is a really good teacher.
Eleanor, hello.
How are you, my dear, sweet bestie?
Never better.
What's up?
Well, Janet has been acting as my assistant.
It's not what she was designed to do.
- Didn't go great.
- But now I'm back to normal.
It turns out that the best Janet was the Janet that was inside Janet all along.
She was feeling a little lost, so I gave her a self-help book to restore her confidence.
Now I'm living my truth and creating my bliss.
Anyway, um, look, Michael asked me if I would serve as his assistant, but I'd quite like to focus on my relationship with Jianyu.
So I recommended you for the job.
Eleanor, you and I could work side-by-side to figure out what's going wrong with this neighborhood.
Will you help me?
- How could I say no?
- Yeah, hurrah!
- Hurrah!
-  What now?
Relax, Eleanor.
You sent this to yourself.
This is your own guilt manifesting itself.
I've been waiting for you.
Jianyu?
You talk now?
You sent me these threatening notes?
What the fork, man?
Some Buddhist monk you are.
You don't belong here.
Admit it.
Okay, you're right.
I don't belong here.
Michael made a mistake.
But I'm trying, dude.
I'm really trying to be a good person.
And I think I'm changing for the better, so just please, please don't rat me out.
Don't worry, I won't.
Because I'm not supposed to be here, either.
I don't know how I got here, I have no idea what's going on, and I am freakin' out, homey!
You got to help me.
I'm scared!
What?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 Hang on, hang on You're not supposed to be here either?
You're a mistake, just like me?
Yeah, and I'm freaking out, dog.
There's so much thoughts in my brain, it's like my head is filled with rocks.
How have you managed to stay undiscovered?
Because I have had to dodge and weave and barely escape with my life, and you don't seem like a super genius.
Hello, Jianyu.
I'm Michael.
Before we start, I know you were a Buddhist monk and kept a vow of silence.
Would you prefer to remain silent here as well?
You literally haven't said a word since we got here?
Yeah.
When I say I'm meditating, I'm just trying to figure out what the fork is happening.
I think we might be in an alien zoo or on a prank show.
No, Jianyu, we're dead.
Whoa, that's a dope prank.
Pfff.
Got to give it up.
Okay, I need to make sure that this isn't some sort of weird trap.
Is your real name Jianyu?
No.
It's Jason Mendoza.
And by the way, everyone here thinks I'm Taiwanese.
I'm Filipino.
That's racist.
Heaven is so racist.
But Tahani said that you helped Michael by putting your hand on his chest and doing some sort of healing magic.
Yeah.
A nurse did that to calm me down once when I crashed my Jet Ski into a manatee.
You crashed your Jet Ski into a manatee?
Yeah.
I'm from Jacksonville, Florida.
It happens a lot.
What did you do for a living?
I was an amateur DJ specializing in EDM.
Electronic dance music.
I was also an amateur hip-hop backup dancer, an amateur body spray inventor um, I did pranks on Vine.
None of those are jobs.
What did you do to make money?
Oh, I sold fake drugs to college kids.
Okay, good.
Okay, here's my biggest question: how did you know that I didn't belong here?
I figured it out the very first night, at the party, using my powers of deduction.
I heard you don't talk.
Well, here's something for you to not talk about.
I don't belong here.
They made a mistake.
Total phony.
So, shh!
Okay, later, man.
Okay.
I vaguely remember that.
I believe you, Jason.
You're not supposed to be here.
Welcome to the bottom of the barrel.
Hello, Tahani.
Oh, hello, Michael.
I was just picking out some fresh orchids for my nightly orchid bath.
So, Tahani, one of your fellow residents is opening a new restaurant tonight.
This neighborhood could use a real morale boost.
And since you're an expert at event planning, I was hoping that you would help with the grand opening.
Oh, Michael, say no more.
I wasn't going to.
I was done.
Well, good, because of course I will.
Janet?
- Hey, there.
- Oh, hello, darling.
I would like to model tonight's event on my most successful gala.
That would be 2006 fundraiser for stem cell research in Barcelona.
"Barthelona," actually.
Oh, it was a perfect evening.
Princess Stephanie was there, as were Posh and Becks.
You know, "International Sophisticate Magazine" gave us five Gwyneths.
Tonight, I'm going to select my jauntiest suit, and I may even wear suspenders.
It's one of the human clothing items I'm most eager to try.
Oh, well, good luck.
Thank you.
Yes, yes.
I'm excited.
And a little nervous.
I'd say that I'm cautiously optimistic.
I hope I don't chicken out at the last second.
Sorry we are talking about suspenders, right?
Like these?
You can do that with oh!
I cannot wait.
Excellent.
So, Tahani has no idea about me?
No.
She thinks I'm a monk, and she thinks you're her best friend.
Great.
I mean, for us.
It's a huge bummer for her.
We need someplace that we can talk in private.
I agree.
Let me show you my bud-hole.
What?
I should warn you: it's a little messy.
This is my bud-hole.
It's just, like, a hole where me and my buds can hang out.
Oh, bud-hole!
Okay, now I get it.
I wrote down on a piece of paper that I needed a private meditation area.
Tahani will never come in.
Pretty unique decorating style you have here, Jianyu.
It's like, "12-year-old boy" meets "13-year-old boy".
Thanks.
Janet helped me get all this stuff.
She rules.
Is she single, or is she married to Michael?
No, no, dude, you cannot date Janet.
she's not human.
And  you have to keep pretending to be Tahani's soul mate.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cool.
Okay, just sit tight, dude.
I have a class to get to.
Wha a class?
I didn't know there were classes.
Chidi is trying to teach me to be a good person.
And it's really hard.
Also, Michael has asked me to be his assistant, whatever that means.
My whole situation here is getting more and more dicey, so I'm actually really glad to have a place I can come when I just want to be myself.
Yeah.
I miss being myself.
Myself was the best.
Whoo!
Whoo!
What's up, man?
You're Jason?
You got two minutes.
Fred Durst is throwing an orgy on a partially capsized yacht.
My dad just texted.
It already started.
So I'll get right to the point.
I listened to your demo.
You're terrible.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay?
You just don't have any what's the word?
Talent.
But don't worry.
You got something better than talent, man.
You got my approximate size and weight.
I'm supposed to play this club for the rest of the week, but I just got an offer to DJ Scott Disick's after party for the Amateur Porn Awards in Reno.
Whoa!
Congrats, bro.
That's the dream.
It's your dream, man.
It's my Tuesday.
I just need somebody to fill in.
Put on the helmet.
Press spacebar on the computer.
Those idiots won't know the difference.
For the next week, Jason, you are Acidcat.
Whoa, there's a lot of old gum in here.
Tahani, how are things going in the front of the house?
Because, to be perfectly frank, things in the kitchen are going great, okay?
I am right on schedule.
Chef Patricia, I have triple-checked every single detail.
Your restaurant opening is going to be the talk of the entire neighborhood.
Thank you for your thoughtfulness and hard work.
I could not have done this without you.
Ah, hello, Tahani.
Sorry.
I should've warned you.
Patricia is actually very happy, but she's also very intense.
It can be confusing.
No, no, no, that's not what's bothering me.
It's just that, well, I looked at the guest list earlier, and Jianyu isn't invited.
Right.
Jianyu is a beautiful spirit, but he literally doesn't talk, and since this will be an evening of lively conversation, and you'll be busy working, I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable.
I totally understand.
Well reasoned, Michael.
As us Brits are fond of saying, "try your best to hide your sadness".
So, the concept of the self is a key subject for a lot of great thinkers.
In the "Tao Te Ching," Lao Tzu wrote, "Knowing others is wisdom, but knowing the self is enlightenment".
Ahh, "knowing" yourself.
Is he talking about what I think he's talking about?
No, Eleanor.
Once again, none of these philosophers is ever talking about masturbation.
Let's move on to this week's main event, David Hume's "A Treatise of Human Nature".
- You read this, right?
- I did.
Well, I tried to.
Well, I tried to want to.
Um, actually, could we postpone this lesson?
I've befriended Jianyu from next door, and I thought I could learn from him.
That's a great idea.
Hume's "bundle theory" of the self is fairly close to Buddhism.
Yeah.
No durr.
That's why I'm doing it.
Do you hear music?
That's not music.
That's EDM.
What are you doing?
Eleanor, you were right.
No more pretending.
It's time for me to be myself.
What's up, homie?
Eleanor?
You broke Jianyu.
Okay, did we miss anything?
Ugh, take that jersey off, you goofball.
Okay.
This is not my fault.
I swear.
Eleanor, one hour ago, that man was a silent Buddhist monk.
Right.
But here's the thing: Jianyu is actually a guy who is nice.
Hi, Tahani.
Eleanor, Chidi, What a lovely surprise.
Don't mind me.
I'm just dropping off my afternoon gloves, and picking up my early evening gloves.
How are you, soul mate?
I'm cool.
I'm sorry.
Am I going mad, or did I just hear you say, "I'm cool"?
Mmm, mm-mm.
I don't think so.
I don't think that happened.
You're you're wrong.
I see what's going on here.
You've got a whisper in your snickerbox.
You're both helping Jianyu to regain his confidence to be able to speak again as a surprise for me!
Oh, busted.
My heart is soaring.
So, Jianyu is talking?
Oh, how wonderful!
I will do everything in my power to encourage him.
Well, not everything.
I won't give him a second mouth.
Unless that would be helpful.
No.
Better not risk it.
I've actually had a better idea.
- Oh.
- Let's add Jianyu to the guest list.
Chidi and Eleanor have been working with him, - and they're going to be here.
- What a great idea.
Patricia!
We can fit another chair, right?
Change the floor plan an hour before opening?
Of course!
The more the merrier!
Hurrah!
I knew tonight was going to be perfect, but now it's going to be even perfect-er.
Obviously, it's impossible for something to be more perfect than perfect Well, it isn't, actually.
Any place or thing in the universe can be up to 104% perfect.
That's how you got BeyoncÃ©.
Oh!
Oh, bud-hole.
Okay.
Now, tell me everything.
Okay, Jianyu is a fraud, just like me.
His real name is Jason.
He's a drug-dealing DJ from Florida.
It's gonna be fine.
We just need a plan.
Oh, I got a plan.
We hack into Michael's phone, download all his nudes, and then blackmail him.
No.
What are you t no.
Yo, you should listen to me.
I came up with hundreds of plans in my life, and only one of them got me killed.
Dude, be quiet.
You are not Jason.
You are a monk named Jianyu.
Got it?
-  -  Hoo hoo hoo!
Oh, another great set, Jason.
They love you, dude.
They don't love me, man.
They love Acidcat.
These cheers are fake.
They hit my ears like boxing gloves of sadness.
Whoa, that's some poetic thoughts, B. I got to be myself.
Attention, Jacksonville.
I'm not Acidcat.
I'm Mr. Music, the DJ.
And this is a Mr. Music, the DJ original.
Pow!
Whoo!
Aah!
Welcome to the opening of The Good Plates.
I just got that.
That's hilarious!
Anyway, at some point or another, every resident in this neighborhood will fulfill his or her soul's true purpose.
Chef Patricia has done that tonight by opening this restaurant.
Now if you'd all like to take a look at tonight's menus That's right.
With Michael's help, Chef Patricia has recreated each person's favorite meal on Earth.
Fun!
It's my Grandmother's maafe.
Fresh perch, slow-roasted in a peanut sauce.
Almost makes me forget how miserable I am right now.
You want to try a bite?
Fish and peanut butter?
No, I'm good.
Thanks.
Tofu?
Oh, man.
I'ma order some jalapeÃ±o poppers.
Shh.
Be quiet and eat your white sponge.
Janet?
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
I didn't get a meal.
According to our files, your favorite meal was the hunger strike you went on to protest Bolivian sex trafficking.
Oh, right.
Of course I did that.
Tahani, great party.
Check it out.
Suspenders!
So dumb.
So much dumber than belts.
Oh, congratulations, Michael.
How's Jianyu doing?
Is he opening up?
Mm, not yet.
But I can tell he wants to.
Don't worry.
I've got a plan.
May I have your attention, please?
Later this evening, we will be enjoying Chef Patricia's delicious dessert, a stunning three-tiered cake that took her a full week to complete.
But first, I'd like to try something fun.
Each one of you has a very special memory attached to the meal you're eating.
Why don't we go around the room and share our stories?
Who'd like to begin?
I'll start, Michael.
One day, I wasn't feeling so great, so I made myself a bowl of this chicken soup When it gets to you, say something short and boring about tofu.
No.
I'm sick of pretending to be Jianyu, the tofu man.
I'm gonna tell the story about my real favorite meal.
- Which is?
- The Buffalo wings at Stupid Nick's Wing Dump in Gainesville.
Wings were free for ladies if they took their top off.
Oh, boy.
- Chidi, a word?
- Yeah.
Anyway, that's how this simple soup saved over 10,000 lives.
If Jianyu starts talking about topless Buffalo wing restaurants, we're all screwed.
Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence at the age of eight and hasn't spoken since, is ready to share with us.
Let me tell you about Stupid Nick.
We need a distraction right the fork now.
No, no, no, no, no.
Eleanor, Chef Patricia poured her heart and soul into this.
Destroying it would be a truly cruel act.
Yeah, no durr.
No, no, no oh!
Sinkhole!
Everyone out!
There's a sinkhole!
Aah!
Glenn!
You broke the world.
That's not a compliment.
Glenn, stay calm.
We're gonna get you out of there.
And we'll put your soup in the fridge so it won't go to waste.
I know that may not be your number one concern right now, but It was up there.
It's real good soup.
Let's go.
Hey, buddy.
You okay?
No.
I was just about to tell an awesome story about a wing eating contest that I lost and a barfing contest that I won, but then a hole opened up in the ground.
I know.
I made the hole to save you from yourself.
You cannot let people know who you really are.
It would be very, very bad.
Beautiful, beautiful Jacksonville.
What's wrong, dog?
You look like you're freaking out.
Things are bad, Pillboi.
Acidcat is suing me for "bleach of contract".
I should have never pretended to be someone else.
It could cost me all my dreams in life.
You got dreams in life?
That's lit.
Of course I have dreams, man.
I don't want to be a DJ in Jacksonville forever.
I want to DJ in Daytona, Tallahassee, Tampa, even.
I want it all.
That's big goals, man.
I know, but I believe in myself.
Someday, the world will see what I already know: that Jason Mendoza is a beautiful, unique soul who has so much to give this world.
Okay, that's Acidcat's speedboat.
Hand me the thing that blows it up.
Michael, I hereby tender my resignation.
I can no longer in good conscience coordinate any further events in The Good Place.
So, I am turning in my evening gloves.
- Tahani - Don't try to make me feel better.
The launch was a disaster.
Poor Jianyu was so terrified that I fear he may never speak again.
My hair is barely cascading down my shoulders.
Tahani, please.
I know your journey with Jianyu has been frustrating, but your situation is actually very typical.
Soul mates sometimes take months to really click.
You have to be patient.
And if anyone should take the blame for the restaurant disaster, it's me.
I thought this neighborhood's troubles were behind us.
Now I fear the worst.
Michael, I hereby rescind the tendering of my resignation.
We must keep the neighborhood together.
- What can I do?
- Oh, well, the sinkhole should be repairing itself in about three days.
Well, as soon as it does, we shall re-launch the restaurant.
I'll hang posters to get the word out, and in the meantime, I'll host a brunch party every morning to lift people's spirits.
- Ah!
- While you repair the universe, I shall prepare the eggs.
Oh, fanciful wordplay.
Indeed.
That is the Tahani that you know and love.
- So what do we do here?
- There's nothing to do.
He's just gonna blab and get him and me both sent to The Bad Place.
It's hopeless.
I can't believe I'm doing this, but, Jason, please come to my classroom.
I will teach you ethics, like I'm doing with Eleanor.
And if you work hard and absorb the material, you just might be able to earn your place here.
No, I'm good.
Dude, Chidi is giving you a lifeline right now, and you need to take it because you suck.
- You suck!
- I know!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
We both suck.
You know who doesn't suck?
Chidi.
He is putting himself in danger to help us, because he, unlike us, is an amazing person.
I didn't get into heaven to go to school.
You didn't get into heaven at all, shirt-for-brains.
I just want to be myself.
That's a very, very bad idea.
Do not be yourself.
You need to be a better version of yourself, okay?
And I do too.
And our only hope right now is this kind, selfless, amazing nerd.
Think about that.
Do you have to call me a nerd so much?
I said a lot of other nice things, okay?
Toughen up, nerd.
Let's get crackin', Teach.
I read this entire David Hume book, and then I read it again because I didn't understand it the first time, and now I'm ready to go.
Wow, that's really impressive.
Where's Jianyu?
Honestly, I don't even know if he's coming.
I am here to learn about ethnics.
Wow, that's great, man.
I mean, it's "ethics," but that's great.
Pretty sure it's "ethnics".
Hey, buddy, I'm proud of you.
This is your first step towards not sucking.
Cool.
I just have two questions: when are football tryouts?
And does this school have a prom?
Oh, no.
Oh, wow.
For the first time ever, I'm the smartest kid in class.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Good afternoon, Eleanor.
What can I get you today?
Whoa.
Lot of new flavors.
Michael felt bad about the sinkhole, so he wanted to give you all a little treat.
I recommend "Full Cell Phone Battery".
Whoa.
It somehow tastes how I felt when my cell phone was fully charged.
Oh, I'm so relaxed.
But they all look good.
This might take me a while.
You know what, Gunnar, uh, why don't you go ahead?
- Thanks so much, Eleanor.
- Mm-hmm.
- What can I get you, Gunnar?
- Hi, Janet.
- Can I have some Folded Laundry?
- Coming up.
Chidi!
You'll never believe it.
I was at the frozen yogurt place and I didn't know what I wanted, so I turned to the guy behind me, and I was like, "Why don't you go ahead"?
Just like that!
"Why don't you go ahead"?
O-okay?
Dude, you don't understand!
I never did stuff like that when I was on Earth.
But now, thanks to your "good person" lessons, I didn't hold up the line.
I didn't even try a dozen samples I didn't want just to spite some jerk who told me I was holding up the line.
You do that?
No, Chidi, I used to do that.
Now I do selfless things without even thinking about it.
That's great.
I-I'm proud of you.
So where's our yogurt?
Ugh.
I forgot it.
Oh Can you go?
I don't want to go all the way back.
I ran all the way here and it was so hot.
I mean, I will happily get it, because I told you I would.
Good person.
So, to sum up: Utilitarianism posits that the correct choice is the one that causes the most good or pleasure, and the least pain and suffering.
I like this one.
It's simple.
Ugh, screw all the other complicated theories, why didn't you start with this one?
Ah, but here's the problem.
If all that matters is the sum total of "goodness," then you can justify any number of bad actions, like torturing one innocent person to save a hundred, or preemptive war Oh, dip, I get it.
It's like, I knew this girl Sheila?
She was a black market alligator dealer with a pierced jawbone.
Um, okay, what?
Sheila was gonna get married to my boy, Donkey Doug and make him move to Sarasota.
It would've broken up my whole break dancing crew and Donkey Doug was our best pop-and-locker.
So I hid a bunch of stolen boogie boards in Sheila's garage and called the cops.
I framed one innocent gator dealer to save a 60-person dance crew.
Shockingly, that is a relevant example of the Utilitarian dilemma.
- Well done.
- Thanks!
Um - Uh, yes, Jianyu?
- Can I be excused?
Tahani's doing a brunch party and I want to get there before all the mini-waffles run out.
- Go ahead, man.
- Yes!
So, you want to roll right into another lesson?
I am revved up to learn, man.
My brain is horny!
Um, can we take a little break?
I've been standing at this chalkboard all day.
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Oh, you could, um, grade my paper I wrote on the concept of Dharma.
Six pages, and I didn't even do that thing where I try to make it longer by starting every sentence with "Interestingly" Sure, I'll do that and, uh we can start another lesson.
Ah, Tahani.
I've been working on my Western Hemisphere brunch banter.
Tell me what you think.
That "New Yorker" article was crazy.
You haven't seen "Hamilton"?
Hey, did you hear about Stephanie?
- Very well done, Michael.
- Hi, there!
We have a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis.
A Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry, what is a Category 55 Emergency Doomsday Crisis?
It's nothing, it's a tiny little inconvenience.
Tahani, dear, could you show us to a private room where no one can see or hear us, even if I yell very loudly out of fear?
It appears that the sinkhole is not repairing itself.
This is very bad, Janet.
We have to go into the sinkhole and fix it by hand.
Get the tools.
Sorry, can I be of any service?
- Ah, Tahani.
- Didn't see you there.
Uh, no, no.
We're just having a slight problem with the enormous sinkhole.
Yes, I meant to tell you I walked past it last night and I I actually saw it get a little bit bigger.
It got bigger?
Ah, well, that's that's so normal.
Um, this is the reaction I have when things are incredibly mundane and expected.
I'm gonna leave now at my regular pace, as I do in most scenarios.
Finally!
Let's get back to it.
Whip out that chalkboard, big boy, show me what you're working with.
Actually, I was going to head into town and pick up some blankets.
Great, I'll grab my sweater.
I can practice letting people cut in front of me.
You know, uh, I just realized that I have blankets, so I'm going to take a nap using the several blankets that I already have.
Good night.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
What's wrong?
Out with it.
I'm just tired, need a break.
No big deal.
The way you're talking to me right now?
"Everything's cool, no big deal" I know that move.
When I told a boyfriend something was "no big deal," it meant anything from "I just bought weed from your nephew," to "I secretly befriended your ex-girlfriend last year, things got out of hand, and now I'm her bridesmaid".
Wow.
Okay, well, in this case, it really is no big deal.
Dude, you're hiding something!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing!
What is wrong?
Jianyu second.
Oh, well done, my love.
So where am I?
Eleanor 6th?
Come on.
Oh, no.
I'm second to last.
Mummy, I made you this.
It's the pretty bird we saw in the garden.
Thank you, Tahani.
It's very competent.
I made a bird, as well.
I worked in a reflective alloy, holding up a mirror to mankind and its mistreatment of these defenseless animals.
Excellent, Kamilah.
I sense the influence of Brancusi and Kapoor.
It seems you're moving out of your structural period, and more into conceptual abstraction.
Good eye, Mother.
I grew tired of objective representation.
I trust my audience.
My birdie has a hat.
Yes, well done, Tahani.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.
- Would you stop doing that?
- What's wrong?
- Okay, fine!
- What's wrong?
You want to know what's wrong?
You are a full-time job.
I wake up, there's Eleanor.
I spend all day teaching Eleanor.
And then it's, "Good night, Eleanor".
Oh, this is a nice dream, my grandma's here.
Wait, she's got Eleanor's face!
And tentacles for some reason.
I thought you liked teaching me.
So now I'm just some huge burden for you?
Yes!
Of course you are!
I am in paradise!
I should be doing paradise things, like rowing out on a lake with a good bottle of wine, reading French poetry.
That's your idea of paradise?
You know, and I can't stop helping you, because then I am shirking my ethical duty.
It's an impossible position!
You know what, if you're so stressed from writing on a chalkboard, why don't you just leave?
We can pretend to be soul mates in public, but other than that, we don't have to see each other!
Fine with me!
I'll move out right now.
Fine!
Good afternoon.
As you all may remember, a sinkhole recently opened up in the town center.
The situation, sadly, has worsened.
Starting right now, no one may go outside under any circumstances.
Leaving your homes could result in catastrophic damage, to you and to the very fabric of the universe.
Okay, bye.
Or we could both just stay here.
We hope you enjoy your eternal stay in the Good Place.
Take advantage of our day spa, or Janet a magical assistant who can get you whatever you want.
You mind turning that off?
It's been playing on a loop for two days.
The whole Neighborhood is offline.
We only get the welcome channel.
I would love to not watch TV, but you canceled school.
What have you done to me, you monster?
Look at all these dishes piling up.
I used to just throw them in the sink, and they'd be magically cleaned by morning.
I did that.
I cleaned the dishes.
Oh.
Then what's up with these bad boys?
You are unbelievable.
Are you still upset?
- You're not over it yet?
- How can I be over it?
We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice "vacation" from your "full-time job".
Get your story straight, bro!
Hey, guys, it's Michael.
Hi, Michael, what a lovely surprise.
Oh, I'd love to make small talk I've been practicing, too.
I'm amazing at it but I'm in a bit of a rush here.
This is Bart and Nina.
They live right next door to the, uh, sinkhole, so they obviously need a place to stay.
I was wondering, as my assistant, maybe you could put them up for a while?
Oh, of course.
Don't don't think twice.
Okay, shouldn't take long.
Between an hour and, um 11 months.
Somewhere in there.
Okay, bye.
Don't go outside.
Ha  Hello, everyone, and welcome to day three of our brunch siege.
I stayed up all night to plan a full day of fun activities.
Just check the schedule I made.
Tahani, you are truly the best.
Yes, you would think so, wouldn't you, Henriette?
Still second to last.
Tahani!
This auction threatens to be an embarrassing failure.
5.2 million isn't bad.
It's very "middle-thermometer".
Your public failure is our public failure.
You know what has to be done.
I'm very pleased to announce that there has been an addition to today's docket.
I'm sure you all know my sister, Kamilah.
Yes.
Kamilah.
Kamilah, of course, is the youngest person ever to graduate from Oxford University, she's a world-class painter, social activist, iconoclast, Olympic gold medalist for archery, a BAFTA Award-winner for her documentary on her Grammy Award-winning album, and the person voted "Most Likely to be Banksy".
So without further ado, take it away from me!
Sorry, I mean take it away, Kamilah.
I am auctioning off a lunch date with me.
The bidding shall commence at Â£3 million.
5 million!
Thank you guys so much.
- Sorry for the imposition.
- Oh, bah.
Oh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you.
We are obsessed with your relationship.
Always whispering, locking yourself in the house all day.
I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job, but I have a lot to learn from you guys.
Your job?
What was your job?
I was a marriage counselor.
You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.
And I did!
It's called, "How to Spot Problems in a Marriage From 100 Miles Away".
both: Oh, cool.
- Really cool.
- Cool.
- Really, really cool.
- Cool, cool.
And what about you, Bart?
Oh, well, my job wasn't nearly as interesting.
I started a company that investigated identity theft.
Analyzing body language, tracking and catching people pretending to be someone they're not.
It's pssh, snooze, am I right?
They're gonna catch us!
This is an extremely precarious situation!
I am vexed, Eleanor!
A marriage counselor and a human lie detector isn't my first choice for company, either.
But they have no reason to suspect us!
Plus, I think they may have actually just come here to, you know, swing.
I say we do it.
It'll get 'em to stop asking questions.
No, I am not going to have sex with someone to get them to stop talking to me!
Really?
You and I are very different.
Yeah, I noticed!
You know what, man?
I have spent every second in this place worried I was gonna get caught, but if we go down right now, that's on you, okay?
Oh, you spend all your time teaching a charming, awesome lady?
How sad for you.
Face it, dude.
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Because guess what, Chidi?
- Ya basic!
- Eleanor Yeah, I know, you want to do that thing where we're arguing and fighting, but then suddenly it's like, "Whoa, this is hot," and we start making out.
Dream on!
Or, whatever, fine, let's just do it.
No, Eleanor, look.
So how much of that did you hear?
We couldn't hear you, but I'm an expert in non-verbal communication, and it is clear you are in conflict.
We're not judging you.
This has been a tough couple of weeks.
I'm sure the stress of the sinkhole has caused lots of soul mate squabbles.
Yes, that's what it is.
A squabble.
- We're squabbling.
- Squabble, squabble!
I can help.
I'm gonna take your relationship and put it under a microscope and dig and poke and prod until you are back to soul mate harmony.
Eleanor, why don't you She never does the dishes.
I have to do them all the time.
We just have different interests.
I like relaxing, he likes getting on my case about the dishes.
I'm getting a lot of repressed anger.
I suspected this when I arrived, but now I'm sure.
- You are hiding something.
- What on earth would I be No, no, no, not you.
Him.
Please go back inside.
It isn't safe to be out of your home.
Please go back inside.
Janet, could you see what's wrong?
Everything.
Ugh.
My goodness!
It's even worse than I thought.
Tahani, what're you doing here?
Well, everyone else might be okay staying inside, but I wanted to help.
So I've brought some cheer and sustenance to raise your spirits.
Look, I made donut holes.
Do you get it?
"Donut holes"?
Sinkhole.
- Funny, no?
- No, too soon.
By exactly nine days.
Tahani, this sinkhole is incredibly dangerous.
If a human gets too close to it, there could be disastrous side effects.
What's what's happening to me?
Oh, that's one of the side effects.
Janet, knock her out while we still have time.
Knock me out?
What does that Boop.
Guys, really, it's no big deal.
"It's not a big deal" is nearly always code for "something is wrong".
Boom!
That's what I said.
I should've been a marriage counselor.
Okay, Chidi, out with it.
What is so unsatisfying about your soul mate relationship?
Be honest, Chidi.
Be, like, the exact right amount of honest so that we can both be happy.
I never had a soul mate on earth.
I-I never even really had a girlfriend that I "loved".
And when I got here, and Michael said I would finally meet my actual soul mate, I was so excited.
And it isn't exactly what I thought.
You've never had an intense relationship before.
This is all uncharted territory.
No wonder you're so tense.
You know, Nina and I are skilled in the art of massage.
Uh, not erotic massage.
Although, it can be, and it often leads there, anyway Okay, well, you know what?
You guys have given us so much to think about.
And I think we should go to bed.
Just the two of us, alone.
Just us.
I know it's not the right time, but I told you.
Tahani, wake up, dear.
Michael.
Did it work?
Did I fix the sinkhole?
Am I a heroine?
No, you did something catastrophically stupid and we had to knock you unconscious.
Why in the world did you go outside?
Because I saw the rankings in the manual.
That manual is only meant to be seen by Architects and Janets.
It's got some very sensitive material.
Plus some song lyrics I've been working on, and I'd rather not let people see those until they're finished.
Anyway, why did seeing the rankings unravel you so?
I was so sorry to hear of your parents' passing.
Please bear with me as I share their last will and testament.
"To Kamilah, we have left Â£68 million, "the home in Kensington, the yacht, and other assorted weekend boats".
Well, what did they leave their second favorite child?
There's still quite a lot of money and property that goes to you.
There is one issue, however.
They have, um, spelled your name incorrectly in the will.
You've got to be kidding me.
It says, "We bequeath the rest of our estate to Tahini".
Like the sauce.
You know what?
I don't want the money.
My sister can have it all.
My whole life, I have lived in your shadow, but now I'm going to step out of it.
I am going to reach heights of success and sophistication that you can only dream of.
Your cardigan's on inside out.
I know!
It's a new trend that I am starting.
Just one example of how I'm going to step out of your shadow.
Oh, I'm sorry that I looked at the rankings, Michael.
But I just don't understand how I'm so low.
My entire life, I have tried to be extraordinary, but it just never seemed to be enough.
Ah.
And you thought you could increase your ranking by helping us fix the sinkhole.
Tahani, the point evaluations stop the moment you die.
But also, out of literally billions, you were one of the most remarkable people on Earth.
You have nothing left to prove, to anyone.
-  - Hi, there.
The sinkhole has begun to repair itself.
-  - It has?
- Could it be - But how Did I?
- "Tahani saves the un" - No, no, no.
Still not you.
You have nothing to do with it.
We've got to leave immediately.
It's now safe to go outside.
It's now safe to go outside.
It's now safe to go outside.
- Morning, teach!
- Morning.
What's this about?
Well, here's what I realized.
It's not just that helping me is a full-time job that you feel you have to do.
The real problem is, that the more you help me, the greater the chance is that I can stay here, and me staying here means you'll never get a real soul mate.
- I'm basically a Utilitarian nightmare.
-  Every ounce of my happiness leads to a ton of pain for you.
So every time the simple fact of my existence starts to bum you out, I want you to hold this up.
At which point, I will leave you alone for as long as you need.
I know we'll never be soul mates, but we're friends.
Now get in this boat and read some boring French poetry.
I I've never actually done this before.
This is a theoretical fantasy.
How do you row a boat?
I'll tell ya, it's good as new.
Go ahead, if you want, just here.
Whoo!
See?
You can jump up and down on it.
Hey, boss.
So you fixed the sinkhole.
Yup, good as new.
Crisis averted.
Everybody have a wonderful day, because I fixed the sinkhole.
- I didn't fix the sinkhole.
- Sorry?
I tried and I tried, but nothing worked.
And then all of a sudden this morning, out of the blue, it just whoop!
It just closed over.
Huh.
How 'bout that?
Well, as your assistant, I officially declare this good news.
No, this is terrible news!
I have no idea what caused it, Eleanor.
And no idea what fixed it.
I want you to come to my office first thing in the morning.
You and I are gonna find this problem.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1  - What are you doing?
-  Dude, I'm freaked out about my meeting with Michael, and if I spend one more second staring at Creepo the Clown, I'm gonna lose it.
You named the clowns?
Psycho, Creepo, Crazy Head, Stupid Juggling Weirdo, Freaky Feet, and Nightmare George Washington.
One of them has to go.
Oh, sexy mailman.
Much better.
In five minutes, Michael wants my help investigating what's making the neighborhood go nuts, which is obviously me.
I mean, I did promise I would help.
What do I do here?
Actually, the answer is Right here in this easily understandable comic strip.
Nope, in this book about the theory of contractualism.
"What We Owe to Each Other".
I saw this movie.
Laura Linney cries in a lake house because Jude Law left her for his ex-wife's ghost.
No.
Quick summary of contractualism.
Uh, imagine a group of reasonable people are coming up with the rules for a new society.
Like if your Uber driver talks to you, the ride should be free?
Sure, but anyone can veto any rule that they think is unfair.
So if you said, "We should be able to break our promises without any repercussions," someone would veto that rule.
Well, my first rule would be that no one can veto my rules.
Well, that's called tyranny.
And it's generally frowned upon.
If you make a promise to someone, you should do it.
Just like I promised to help you and still am, despite your constant mockery.
"Despite your constant mockery".
Whatever, you love it.
So either I help him find the problem, which is me, and I'm doomed, or I don't help him, and then I'm behaving unethically and the whole world goes crazy and I'm caught anyway.
I need to figure out a way both help him and not help him at the same time.
That's literally not possible.
Oh, really?
I once posed as a hot prom date for my cousin, both helping him and later, according to his therapist, not helping him.
Oh, hey, Eleanor, thanks for coming in.
Sorry about the mess.
Oh, I forgot, you don't see in nine dimensions.
There's just a lot of there's a lot of tension in the air right now.
Are you okay, buddy?
- You seem kind of stressed.
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
Top of my game, actually.
Uh, here, let me just, uh Have a seat.
There you go.
So to prepare to meet all of you, I studied the human concept of friends.
I even watched all ten seasons of the show "Friends".
Boy, those friends really were "friends," weren't they?
Although and I realize this is the kind of observation that would only occur to the mind of an eternal being How did they afford that apartment?
A waitress and a chef with those Manhattan real estate prices.
Yeah, we were all confused about that too.
Anyway, it's been a tough couple of days.
Right now, I could really use a friend by my side.
Well, you know me.
The person who has audibly promised to help you.
So you need to me house-sit the whole week?
Sounds like somebody's gonna have a sweet vay-cay.
As I told you before, my mom is very sick.
I'm gonna help her move into assisted living.
Well, I'm here for you.
And your Wi-Fi is way better than my neighbor's, so I'm in.
It's gonna mean taking care of Lester too.
Walk and feed him twice a day.
Give him his kidney medicine.
Yup, got it feed his kidneys.
- Eleanor?
- Yeah?
This is gonna be a very stressful week for me.
I need to know that I can count on you.
I won't let you down.
I promise.
Jianyu, my love.
How are you?
- I am decidedly so.
- That's very profound.
Um, soul mate an idea.
Our neighborhood now features a spa, and it offers couples packages.
And I thought maybe we could get facials and do yoga and talk in long, discursive sentences.
What do you say?
- Signs point to yes.
- Oh!
Marvelous.
We'll go today.
Dude, you got to come with us to the spa.
No way.
No, that's really weird.
You can't make small talk with her for one day without being caught?
No, I can't, and she freaks me out.
She's so pretty, like Nala from "The Lion King".
And she talks so smart, like, um Nala from "The Lion King".
You got to help me.
Well, if I feel sympathy for anyone, it's Tahani.
She's going through the same thing I am, but she doesn't know it.
Which means maybe I'm obligated to tell her.
Although maybe it's better not to know.
Is ignorance bliss, or will the painful truth actually be healing You ready, Jianyu?
Oh, I cannot wait to just relax and talk and chat and just, you know get to know each other.
Hey!
Maybe I'll come too.
Oh.
Well, Chidi it's just that this is, um this is really more of a couples thing.
I know.
But Eleanor's off with Michael, and Jianyu feels comfortable when I'm around.
Right?
- Made in Taiwan.
- Yes, you were.
You were made in Taiwan.
So couples date!
Let's go!
I never really looked around your office the first day.
What is all this junk?
Well, technically, architects aren't allowed to own any human objects, but oh, I just love them so much.
And over here, look at this.
Aren't paper clips the most amazing things in the world?
Yeah.
Sure.
Anyway, my current theory is that some object in the neighborhood is a design flaw which is causing everything to go haywire.
So we need to find that object.
We're gonna start with the rocks.
Now, I've investigated all of the rocks in the neighborhood.
These 78 are the most suspicious.
Maybe to an architect, they might look suspicious, but to me, they just look like rocks, so I'm not sure how I can help.
Do any of them look defective?
Sinister?
You know, like they're taunting you?
Always one step ahead?
You devious little monsters, you.
Okay, let's take a deep breath here, buddy.
You need to chill a little.
'Cause you have a very psycho, "burnout guy muttering to himself at a library computer" type vibe.
It's my responsibility to solve the problem.
What else can I do except keep working?
You could stop working.
Look, I promised to help you, and honestly, the way I can help you is to force you to take a break.
And not working will help me work?
Yes!
Recharge the old batteries.
I promise this is gonna help both of us.
Let's go.
Okay.
Let's keep our eyes peeled for twigs that may have a nefarious agenda.
- Okay, crazy, come on.
- Yeah.
Hello, Janet.
Jianyu and I are here for the couples package, please.
And also I will be joining them.
Great, and who is the other half of your couple?
Oh, no, no, it's just me.
Couples are pairs of people.
Yup, and, uh, there is a pair of people, Tahani and Jianyu.
And then also I am here.
Great, and who will be joining you?
No one.
Um, it's really quite simple, Janet.
They are a couple, and I am a third part of that couple.
Uh, a helper part who is here for fun and excitement.
It's a three-person couple.
Does not compute.
Does not compute.
I'm just kidding.
I mean, it doesn't compute, but I'm not gonna explode or anything.
Right.
Well, I'll see you inside, darling.
Okay, you have to step up.
Find a way to connect with her without, you know, being you.
What does that even mean?
Do I talk or not talk?
Do I be nice to Tahani, or do I throw all her jewelry in the toilet?
That's the opposite of being nice?
So no toilet?
What is it with you and frozen yogurt?
Have you not heard of ice cream?
Oh, sure, but I've come to really like frozen yogurt.
There's something so human about taking something great and ruining it a little so you can have more of it.
That is very human.
Why do you need a human to be your assistant?
I mean, aren't there more of whatever you are?
Well, since we're becoming friends, like Ross and Phoebe Weird combo to pick, but okay.
I'm gonna tell you a secret.
Usually, architects don't live in their neighborhoods.
Usually, the people show up, we play the movie, Janet is there to answer questions, and you're on your own.
But I had this theory.
I thought transition would be easier if the architect were on-site for at least the first 1,000 years or so.
That's why you've been so freaked out.
'Cause your butt is on the line.
My boss thought I was nuts.
And if this neighborhood doesn't work, I am in big trouble.
But more importantly, I promised all of you that you would be safe and happy.
And you just don't break a promise.
Unlike Ross when he promised Emily not to talk to Rachel.
Wow, you are really into that show.
You know something?
I feel better already.
Should we get back to work?
Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.
The whole point is to stop thinking about work and start having fun.
Now, what should we do first?
both: I'm going out In a blaze of glory Lord, I never drew first But I drew first blood And I'm no one's son So call me young gun Whoo!
This is so interesting!
I mean, there's no point to it.
The images on the screen relate to nothing.
Some time passed, and then it was over.
That's karaoke!
Oh, let's do it again.
Okay, my hands are heated to the ideal 105 degrees.
Who would like to go first?
Oh, well what if I go first, and then perhaps Jianyu could stand near me and share some intimate aspects of his life?
Or what if while Janet messages Tahani, I massage Jianyu?
Jianyu, darling, let's discuss the arts.
I adore the impressionists.
Who's your favorite artist?
I mean, Pitbull changed the game Sorry, just working the oft-neglected mandible area.
Oh, man!
I didn't even want that thing.
Why am I trying to win it?
Because the machine says it's a prize.
- Oh!
- Boom!
How many tickets do I get?
Six?
- Is that all?
- Well, watch this.
- Is that allowed?
- Not really.
But it is a time-honored tradition.
Say no more.
I got it.
I got it.
- Whoo!
- Whoo!
You know something?
As much as I've always wanted to be around humans, I think I've missed a big part of what makes them wonderful.
Sometimes all you guys think about is how you can have the most fun.
Exactly!
That was practically my mantra.
What's up, dong bait?
Drop everything you're doing.
Rihanna is performing in Vegas.
I got tickets.
We are road-tripping.
Oh, I can't!
I promised I'd house-sit one more day, and I have to feed this stupid dog.
I'm sorry, does this dog smoke blunts topless on a yacht like a boss?
- 'Cause that's how Ri-Ri do.
- That's a very good point.
This is floor seats in Vegas for Rihanna.
The booze is free there.
Do I really need to keep going?
Okay, this is dinner tonight, breakfast tomorrow I have an idea.
This is in case of emergency.
Do not eat this unless it's an emergency.
Wow.
I'm ready to be a mom.
I'm having trouble getting this mask to stick.
Yes, it's 'cause my pores are just so small.
There's no way anything could ever adhere to my skin.
It's a curse, really.
Jianyu?
What are your pores like?
Janet, can you show me to the sauna, please?
Dude, she's trying so hard, and you're giving her nothing!
Just pick a fact that you know about her and just muddle through.
She said she likes impressionist paintings.
Impressionist paintings?
Okay, say no more.
No, no, no, I definitely feel like I need to say more.
Jia  So would you say I helped you today?
Oh, so much.
I had fun, I didn't think about my problems, and I won this ugly yellow toddler, - which is one of the most - beautiful things I've ever seen.
Thank you so much.
All right, I'll see you tomorrow, friend.
You sure this is where you want to be right now?
At the Tea for Two couples cafe?
There's no use avoiding it, Chidi.
I'm alone.
Jianyu and I have nothing in common.
I just want a soul mate.
Someone I can share my passions with, someone who I can talk to about the ethereal colors of a Degas.
I love Degas.
I took painting lessons as a kid, and Degas was always my inspiration.
And do you like France as much as I do?
Well, they enslaved my country for 300 years.
So no.
- But they have great museums.
- Yes.
Welcome to my cafe, you two.
We have a special on soul mate muffins.
Two for the price of zero.
Everything is free.
Oh, uh, we're not soul mates.
- No.
- We're just, uh - soul friends.
- Oh.
Hey, buddy.
I have all new fun stuff for us to do today.
Eleanor, I have huge news.
Not working actually worked.
It did what now?
After our day off, with a completely clear head, I realized part of what makes humans so fun is that they're unpredictable.
The chaos we've been experiencing is exactly what would happen if a resident behaved unpredictably.
The problem in our neighborhood it's not a rock or an object.
It's one of the people.
Oh!
We need to celebrate!
I know, okay Paper clip shower!
So do you think we're looking for a man, or do you think we're looking for two men?
Not sure.
We don't know anything about this person.
I mean, does he or she even know that they caused all these problems?
No, that can't be.
I mean, what kind of monster would wreak havoc and then say nothing?
So this is the main place where the garbage fell from the sky.
- Janet.
- Hi there.
I need a list of everyone that was here on garbage duty during orientation.
Oh.
Eleanor, our criminal is on this very short list.
People were flying that day too.
I'll add everybody who flew overhead.
Ugh.
Eleanor, our criminal is on this much longer list.
Oh, hey, homey.
Thanks for your advice.
I'm about to give Tahani the best gift ever.
Check it.
What?
She likes impressionist paintings, right?
I got her a painting of the best impressionist of all time, Frank Caliendo.
He can do it all fat Al Pacino, fat Jerry Seinfeld, regular John Madden.
"Say hello to my little friend".
"Forget about it".
This is where the sinkhole opened up.
And the guest list that night was limited.
There were a total of 30 people here that night.
Only 30, huh?
How do you pump your fists again?
Is this it?
But 66 others passed through to take a look before it opened, and everyone else in the neighborhood was in a close radius.
Oh, boy, that doesn't narrow it down at all.
Feels like the end of the road.
"End of the Road," Boyz II Men, karaoke.
Let's go don't think about it too much.
Janet.
My hoodie, please.
- What's happening?
- I give up.
I can't help the people I promised that I would help.
I feel like "Friends" in season eight, out of ideas and forcing Joey and Rachel together, even though it made no sense.
I hope the sinkhole opens up again and swallows me whole.
Paula!
Hey, girl.
How's the dog?
Still fat, Eleanor.
Still fat.
The vet says his stomach expanded to the size of a basketball and that it will never shrink.
Oh, well, that's not my fault.
How was I supposed to know he would literally eat all of the food?
It shouldn't have been an issue.
You were supposed to be there, but you broke your promise as soon as it wasn't convenient for you, and now I have a very bulbous dog.
Well, you know what?
You're rude.
'Cause you didn't even ask me how the Rihanna concert was.
She was very late.
And a little drunk.
I promised to help you, and I will, however I can.
If you want to look at a million rocks like a psychopath, I'll be there.
If you want to just lay here and cry in your hoodie, I'm cool with that.
Honestly, I don't know how I can help you, 'cause I'm just a person and you're, like, this super magical Orville Redenbacher type guy who invented this entire universe, but I'll do my best.
I'm right here.
Oh, my gosh.
Of course.
How did I not see it?
Janet I found the answer to the problem.
Call a neighborhood meeting.
Should it be festive and casual or moribund and devastating?
Moribund and devastating, please.
Great!
Hello, Jianyu, Chidi.
What's this?
I made you a art.
It's three of me.
It's ballerinas, painted in the style of the impressionists.
Of course.
You don't say things, but you do things.
And you feel things.
Only my true soul mate could ever give me such a perfect gift.
Thank you.
What's going on?
Well, I did what you said.
I honored my agreement to help Michael find the problem, and he found the problem.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
After I'm gone, take down the rest of those clown paintings.
But leave up the sexy mailman.
To remember me by.
Thank you all for your patience with the problems in our neighborhood.
I have finally discovered the cause.
There was one common link among every incident.
And when I figured it out, it was a shock.
But there's no escaping it.
The problem is me.
And now I have to leave you forever.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 There's no escaping it.
The problem is me.
-  - And now I have to leave you forever.
Michael, you can't be the problem.
Oh, but I am.
You see, architects aren't supposed to live in the neighborhoods they design, but I love humans, so I-I wanted to try.
I see now that was a mistake.
My meddling is the one true constant in all of our disasters.
I tried to force Jianyu into opening up, which caused a sinkhole to open up.
I kicked a puppy into the Sun, and garbage rained down.
I grossly underestimated the number of shrimp needed for the opening-night party, and what flew through the sky the next day, taunting me for my failures?
I'm sorry, everyone.
I'm truly sorry.
- Janet?
-  Please call a train to escort me into retirement.
You see, the only way in and out of a neighborhood is by train, and Janet is the only one who can operate them.
Oh, my dear Janet.
Will you be okay after I leave?
Yes.
This will not affect me in any way.
Jeez, show some compassion.
Well, I can't feel sad, but here's my best approximation of human crying.
Baaah!
- Oh, Janet, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.
What did you say to him?
Did you make him do this somehow?
Nope, this was entirely his idea.
Dude, this is good news.
Michael's gonna get a chill retirement, which, frankly, he desperately needs, and I can finally relax.
It's forking perfect.
No, it's terrible.
Michael's wrong.
He's not the problem.
Well, Michael did bring me here, which was the mistake that led to all the other problems.
So, in that sense, he is the real problem.
Ha!
How do you like them ethics?
I just ethics'd you in the face, Chidi!
It doesn't change the fact that we weren't truthful.
There's an old Chinese proverb "Lies are like tigers.
They are bad".
- That's it?
- It's more poetic in Mandarin.
Look, Michael is retiring.
He's gonna be on an angel boat somewhere, smoking moonbeam cigars.
Now, Tahani is throwing him a good-bye party.
Let's go help out.
Sure, that will more than make up for the pain and misery and lying.
Yes, now you're getting it.
Hey, Chidi, just read your article on logical positivism so dry.
Oh, thanks, Henry.
Whoa!
New boots.
Oh, yeah, just got 'em.
Saw them in the store, and I was just like, "Whoa"!
Tell the truth do you like 'em?
Oh.
- Oh, yeah.
- Not too red?
- No.
- Crystals aren't too much?
Crystals are not too much.
Oh, well, that makes me feel much better 'cause I was really going back and forth over whether they were worth the money.
They were super expensive.
Yeah, well, they're, uh, amazing.
Those are the coolest boots I've ever seen in my life.
Thanks so much, buddy.
Right.
Bye.
My God what have I done?
Tonight needs to be the perfect blend of celebratory, reverential, bittersweet, upbeat, fun, and effortless.
This is #TahaniTime.
What is all this?
Oh, no, Michael, you're not supposed to see it till it's all set up.
But, well, welcome to your retirement party.
Look, over there, I've even set up a buffet of themed desserts, like retire-mint chocolate cake or, uh, "flan voyage".
Oh, boy.
Oh, and here we have a piÃ±ata shaped like you, which is always fun.
By the way, uh, what's you're favorite color for the tablecloths?
Well, it's not perceptible by human eyes.
It's called "pleurigloss".
Could you describe it?
It's the color of  When a soldier comes home from war and sees his dog for the first time.
Hmm.
How about blue?
Tahani, I'm so sorry.
We need to cancel this party immediately.
But why?
For a being like me, retirement is not something fun.
What is "retirement" for you exactly?
Well, I wasn't gonna share this so as not to upset you, but it's, a an extreme form of punishment.
We call it "The Eternal Shriek".
My soul will be disintegrated, and each molecule will be placed on the surface of a different burning sun.
And then my my essence will be scooped out of my body with a flaming ladle and poured over hot diamonds.
Oh, but the diamonds sound lovely.
- They're not -  And then what's left of my body will be endlessly beaten with a titanium rod, like a Like a piÃ±ata.
Yes, except you have the string around my waist, but instead it will definitely be around my genitals.
- What?
- Oh, Michael, I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to honor you.
Please, allow me to reconceive the event.
Of course.
All right, everyone, we're starting over.
The key word for tonight is just "somber".
Jianyu, my love, we're gonna have to get rid of all of the party poppers immediately.
-  - No, not by using them.
No, Jianyu.
Done.
He's gonna be tortured?
Dang it.
I was almost handed a perfect solution to all my problems without having to work for it at all, and now it's gone.
Why do bad things always happen to mediocre people who are lying about their identities?
Okay, you have two options.
You can confess and save Michael, or you can continue to lie and condemn him to an eternity of unimaginable pain.
Or option C continue to lie about myself and find a way to save Michael.
Can we somehow throw Tahani under the bus?
That would be a classic "two birds with one stone" scenario.
Plus, I'd get her house.
Three birds.
No, there's no way to stop this except confessing.
Any moment now, Michael is going to get on that train, and we will never see him again, just like Professor Lindeman after I asked him to reread my 3,600-page manuscript.
He said he was going out for cigarettes, but then he just left his tenured position at the Sorbonne.
Great story.
Janet?
-  - Hi, there.
Hi.
So the only way out of the neighborhood is a train?
That's correct.
I am the only one who can call the train, and it needs me to operate.
Choo-choo.
One more question, and, um, this is a little weird, but can we uh, shut you down?
Yes, great question.
There is a kill switch in a remote sector of the neighborhood in the event that I malfunction and attempt to harm the residents.
If you press it, I will be destroyed.
- Anything else?
- No, that's good, thanks.
- Okay.
- Whoa, you want to kill Janet?
Michael can't retire if he can't leave.
He can't leave if there's no Janet to run the train.
It's a perfect solution.
Janet, high five, please?
- Thanks, babe.
-  You cannot kill Janet.
Killing is one of the most famous moral no-nos.
Janet is a nonhuman object who was sent here to help us, and the way she can help us is if we kill her.
We're doing one small murder-y thing for a bigger, better reason.
The ends justify the means.
Do you know who said that?
Was it someone nice and great, like Oprah?
It was Machiavelli -  - A very non-Oprah-like figure.
And what happens after we kill her?
We'll have to lie to everyone about what we did, and lying is always wrong.
Why?
Why would I tell Henry that I liked his boots?
I don't like his boots.
I hate his boots.
Yes, I know.
You've talked about it for the last two days.
I lied to him.
You wrote your thesis on Kant.
He believed that lying is always morally wrong no exceptions.
Yes, well, Kant was a lonely, obsessive hermit with zero friends.
Sometimes we do thing just to be polite, but if you really feel that strongly about it, tell him the truth.
Also, I don't care, 'cause it's the middle of the night.
This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
They do?
Hey, Chidi.
- You sit in on my class today?
- Uh, I did, yeah.
Great lecture, by the way so bleak.
Thanks, bud.
It's actually perfect that you are here.
I got something for you.
Oh, my God.
You loved mine so much, I decided to get you your own pair.
We can be boot brothers.
Wow.
I can't accept these.
They're too expensive.
Sure you can.
Try 'em on, mate.
The fact that you liked mine so much really made me feel like I made the right choice to buy them.
After all, why should I have all the fun and boots, eh?
I-I don't I don't know.
Those look great.
Take 'em for a spin.
-  - You're flying.
Mm, thanks.
Speeches!
Time for speeches, everyone.
Michael, as someone who didn't exactly have the steadiest parental guidance, I just want to thank you.
You were always there for us.
I shouldn't have been.
I was the problem.
Yes, but it was also great when you weren't there.
Don't worry.
Soon I won't be forever.
Because of The Eternal Shriek!
Yes, thank you, Glenn.
Look, what I'm trying to say is this Michael, you always kept us warm and safe like a bright, glowing sun.
Like the one I kicked the dog into or the one I'm going to be burned on the surface of for eternity?
Okay, no more speeches.
Speeches are over.
Michael's going to talk now.
Ugh, I'm sorry I was so grumpy.
It's just I'm sad that I have to leave before doing all the human things that I wanted to do.
I wanted to get my hair wet.
You know, I-I wanted to pull a hamstring.
To learn the difference between "toward" and "towards".
I wanted to do that thing where you walk down the hallway, and someone else is walking the other way, and then you both lean to one side and then the other, and then you both chuckle over your shared foible.
I wanted to get a rewards card, any rewards card.
I-I wanted to talk briefly to someone and then say, "Take it sleazy".
I wanted to eat a saltine.
Oh!
I actually have some saltines.
Here, try this.
Pretty dry and too salty.
Well, going out on a real low note here.
Okay, bye, everyone.
Well, take it sleazy.
You got to say it?
Yes, but then you say it back.
No, it's not organic.
Uh, Janet, how many "Janets" have there been?
There have been 25 generations of Janet.
Each new update of Janet gains more wisdom and social abilities.
Fun fact the first Janet had a click wheel.
So it's like aging for a human?
You're you're growing up?
That's how I like to think of it, Chidi.
I can't eat, so every time there's a new version of Janet, I like to take a piece of birthday cake and smash it around where my mouth is.
Look, Janet has has learned and grown.
She's essentially living a life.
We can't kill her.
Not with that attitude, we can't.
Listen, man, I'm dead, you're dead, we all died, and now we're killing her.
Pay it forward.
Uh, no, that's not what that means at all.
Eleanor?
Here we are.
Just press that button, and it's good-bye, Janet.
Chidi, I can see that you're worried, and I just want to assure you, I am not human, and I cannot feel pain.
Ah, thank you.
That helps.
However, I should warn you I am programmed with a fail-safe measure.
As you approach the kill switch, I will begin to beg for my life.
It's just there in case of an accidental shut down, but it will seem very real.
Cool.
So who's doing this, me or you?
I think I have to.
Um, being a bystander seems worse, somehow.
Okay, here we go.
Chidi, no, no, no!
Chidi, please!
Please, please, please don't hurt me.
I don't want to die!
Please, please Ah!
Again, I am not human.
I can't die.
I am simply an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge built to make your life easier.
You're pleading seems so real.
Oh, yes, it is a very effective fail-safe.
Ugh, you want a robot killed right, you have to do it yourself.
Eleanor?
Eleanor, no, no, no.
Please, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Eleanor, I have kids.
I have three beautiful children Tyler, Emma, and little, tiny baby Phillip.
Look at Tyler.
Tyler has asthma, but he is battling it like a champ.
Look at him.
No, Eleanor, look at them.
Look at them!
Look at them!
Aah!
It's so realistic!
Eleanor, again, I'm not human.
This is a stock photo of the crowd at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.
That's right, it's not real.
- Let's just do this.
- Right.
Please, I have so much to live for.
- No, no, no, please.
- We're not even near the Hey, guys, what's going on?
That party was lame, so I bailed.
Then I saw you, so I followed you here.
- Oh, look, a button.
- No, no, no!
Jianyu, no!
Ah, man, I wanted to push that button.
Not cool, dude.
Whoa.
What happened to Janet?
She's she's dead.
I-I-I killed her.
Not killed.
Remember, Janet was not a living being, so she can't be killed.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention I have been murdered.
Attention What do we do, Eleanor?
What do we do?
Chidi, you just murdered Janet.
We have to flee your crime scene.
Run!
I have been murdered.
- Sorry, Janet!
- I have been murdered.
Attention I have Attention I have been murdered.
Okay, dude, crash course in getting away with bad stuff.
You have to act calm and cool like you don't have a care in the world.
Okay?
Great.
Oh, wow.
Look, it's "Weekend at Bernie's," 'cause you're a dead guy in sunglasses.
We have fun, don't we, Chidi?
I've never been more stressed out in my entire life.
I know what you need.
Janet, can you get Chidi some weed?
Oh, that's right.
You killed Janet.
Well, Janet's been murdered.
That's a nice capper to this wonderful day.
I don't really know what happens now because Janet has never been murdered before only today, here on my watch, while I was distracted with a party that Tahani was throwing for me, which I didn't want.
Michael, you mustn't blame yourself.
I'm not.
I'm blaming you.
Anyway, what is there to say about Janet that hasn't already been said by the giant Janet alarm in the sky?
"I've been murdered"!
I think that says it all.
Hello.
-  -   Janet, you're alive!
Hello, Architect, please enter your four-digit pin.
Uh, what is it?
Uh, what is it?
What is it?
Um oh, right, right, right!
It's my, uh my birth year.
Uh  I got to change that.
That's too easy to guess.
Janet who murdered you?
- Oh.
Oh, no.
- Shh, okay.
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, her memory must have been wiped clean, so now she's gonna have to re-upload all the knowledge in the universe, which will only take a few days.
Okay - Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Everyone, um, until I get to the bottom of this, my retirement is officially postponed.
- Whoo!
-  -  - Oh, oh.
Hello.
Hello.
You got to admit I kind of nailed it.
All we have to do now is keep the secret forever.
J-Dog, you cool?
No, by the time I got to the piÃ±ata, all the candy was gone.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
Chidi?
Cheedster?
What's, uh, happening, buddy?
You have a crazy look in your eye, and you're retreating into your shirt.
You're kind of turtling.
Henry, are you all right?
What happened?
I have an aneurysm.
Requires emergency surgery.
Doctor's give me a 50/50 chance.
So, if there's anything you need to say to me, you should do it now.
Oh, well actually, um They let you wear your boots in here?
They're the only things that bring me comfort.
What did you want to say to me?
Oh, um just that I'm here and I love you, man.
I love you, too, boot brother.
Okay.
Chidi!
You didn't have to stay here all night.
So surgery went well?
All clear?
Right as rain, buddy.
That is so, so, so great.
- I hate your boots.
- What?
I told you that I loved your boots three years ago, and I was lying, and that lie has haunted me ever since, and people tried to tell me it was fine just a nice, little white lie in the form of social niceties but I disagreed, and then yesterday I thought you were gonna die, but now you're not dead, and I can finally be honest and say that those boots are terrible and hideous and I hate them.
Whoo!
This is why everyone hates moral philosophy professors.
Yeah, I know.
And I get it.
I don't care that she came back or that we did it for a good reason.
I can't live with this lie.
I'm going to confess to the murder of Janet.
What?
Dude, why?
Janet is fine.
We didn't harm her at all.
We didn't?
Hey, Janet?
-  - Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Janet, would you please recite the English alphabet?
A-B Janet.
She knows her A-B-Janets.
She literally knew everything in the universe, and now she's a baby.
And even if she were okay, it would be too painful for me to live with these lies.
What are you talking about?
It is so easy to live with a lie.
I once pretended to have a terminal illness to meet Scott Wolf at a Sunglass Hut.
Victimless crime.
Fine.
I won't say anything because I promised to help you, - and the moral implications -  Of everything that we've done are so complicated that I may never untangle them, but I hate lying.
I always have, and this is going to eat me up inside forever.
You might be able to shrug this off, and forget about it, but I never will.
Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Jianyu!
Michael, Janet said you wanted to speak to me.
Well, actually, she was just drooling a lot and saying "hello" over and over again, but she did point at you.
I owe you an apology.
Oh, no.
No, you don't.
No, um but please continue.
You were only trying to help.
You're a wonderful person, and if I ever do have a retirement party, I hope you plan it.
Thank you for gathering, everyone.
I want to keep you all updated.
Here's what we know.
Someone slaughtered Janet.
Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, easy.
I assume that this horrifying act is somehow related to the other issues we've had here.
It also means that the problems in this neighborhood are not 100% my fault.
There is something else at work here.
If anyone has any information about any of this, I beg you, tell me.
Hey, I love you, man.
Michael the problem in the neighborhood is me.
I was brought to the Good Place by mistake.
I'm not supposed to be here.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1   Eleanor, come on in.
Well, not often you get to confront your greatest failure face-to-face.
Good to see you, too, bud.
I am just dumbfounded as to how this happened.
Our system has never made a mistake before It's just not possible.
And yet, here we are.
First things first, who are you?
Well, my name is Eleanor Shellstrop, and some of the info you had was right.
I mean, "flattened by boner pill truck after dropping margarita mix in grocery store parking lot," that's a very me way to die.
But all the other info was wrong.
In my defense, when I first arrived, and you said, "You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead, and you're in the Good Place," I had no reason to think that was a mistake.
Location and date of birth, please.
Phoenix, Arizona, October 14, 1986.
So sorry, that's what I used to tell people when I lied about my age.
I was born in 1982.
You lied so much, you forgot your own birthday.
Not a great start, but it should be enough for Janet to locate your file.
- Janet?
-  - Janet - What's that?
What's that?
What's this?
Her memory's still being rebooted because, oh, you know, someone murdered her.
Janet, could you please locate the file for an Eleanor Shellstrop, born in -  1982?
- Yes.
Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
- Sure.
-  Anything else?
No, Janet, this is actually a cactus.
This might take a while.
Whee!
Since Janet can't retrieve your file, I need to find another way to determine what kind of person you were.
This is a quick litmus test.
Handful of questions designed to tell whether you are fundamentally good or bad.
Question number one: Did you ever commit a serious crime, such as murder, sexual harassment, arson, or otherwise?
No.
Did you ever have a vanity license plate, like "MAMASBMW," "LEXUS4LIZ," or "BOOBGUY"?
No.
Did you ever reheat fish in an office microwave?
Ew, no.
Have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band "The Red Hot Chili Peppers"?
No.
Did you ever take off your shoes and socks on a commercial airline?
And socks?
Ew, who would do that?
People who go to the Bad Place, Eleanor, that's the point.
And unless I can figure out a compelling reason to keep you here, you will spend eternity with murderers, and arsonists, and people who take off their shoes and socks on commercial airlines.
Mm, Janet, can I have a glass of water, please?
-  - Here you go.
Oh, gosh, you said "water"?
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.
-  - There you go.
Ahh.
I really do have sympathy for your situation.
I mean, you thought your soul mate was a good person, and then you learned that she's just an immoral grifter.
- Tahani, please.
- Am I wrong?
She lied to everyone.
She caused a giant sinkhole into which poor Glenn fell.
She caused a trash storm.
She well, she pretended to be my friend when I really needed one.
And, lest we forget, she murdered Janet.
As far as I'm concerned, the sooner she's gone, the better off we'll all be.
I I understand that Eleanor violated our trust, but please, when you're talking to Michael, try to think about what she's had to go through.
All right.
I will, for you.
But we've been through a lot as well.
You know, I haven't been this upset since my good friend Taylor was rudely upstaged by my other friend, Kanye, who was defending my best friend, BeyoncÃ©.
And finally, a multi-part question: Did you ever appear on the American television program "The Bachelor" or its companion shows "The Bachelorette" and "Bachelor in Paradise," or post on any social media site that you were emotionally invested in any of the relationships the contestants were pursuing?
No.
Okay.
You did very well on the questionnaire, Eleanor.
So far, so good.
-  - Michael, good news.
I was able to obtain Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
Is it actually a cactus?
- I don't understand.
- I want to see the file for Eleanor Shellstrop.
Is that what you have, or do you have a cactus?
- I have the file.
- You're sure?
You have the file and not a cactus?
That is correct.
I have Eleanor Shellstrop's file.
I do not have a cactus.
Excellent.
Please, give me the file.
- Here you go.
-  Thank you, Janet.
- You're welcome.
-  Well, I say we call it a day.
I mean, I nailed the questionnaire, and you're swimming in cacti.
Can't we just chalk this up to a hilarious mistake and move on?
No, we can't, Eleanor.
There's no such thing as a mistake in this realm.
And yet, you are, somehow, a mistake.
I mean, you're a giant chunk of spinach in the teeth of the universe.
I need to understand every facet of this disaster.
Tell me a lie about yourself.
- Any lie.
- I love the opera.
And now a truth.
I love Women's MMA.
We don't like to use this.
We've never really had a call for it before you, but in the interest of time.
Eleanor, did you murder Janet?
No, I did not.
Do you know who did?
Yes.
Will you tell me who it was?
No.
I assume it was one of your friends, and I admire you for protecting him or her.
But Eleanor, in the Good Place, there's no room for bad people or bad actions, so anyone involved in the murder of Janet will be reviewed and judged, and there will be consequences.
Tahani, come on in.
Chidi.
Imposter who soiled our paradise with her moral turpitude.
'Sup?
Thank you for confessing, I don't know what I would - have done if you hadn't - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm amazing.
Bad news.
Michael knows I didn't kill Janet which means it's only a matter of time before he finds out that you did and that you did it because you were trying to stop Bonehead Jones over here.
Hey, homies!
Then he'll figure out that Jianyu's also a phony, and, here's the real dong-buster, Michael said anybody who did anything bad might have to go - Ohh - Which means Jianyu's gone, you might be gone, and all three of us are royally forking forked!
This is terrible.
What am I supposed to do if he asks me?
I don't know.
Kant would say that lying in any scenario is wrong, so if Michael asks you if you killed Janet, you should say yes.
On the other hand, snitches do get stitches.
That is true.
I read that once on the back of my boy Peanut's tricep.
You just casually cited Immanuel Kant.
Yeah, I know we're in a miserable bind here, but this might be the proudest day of my life.
No offense, but that's a real bummer of a life.
Tahani, I'll get right to the crux of the matter.
Did you murder Janet?
Absolutely not.
Now, you spent a lot of time with Eleanor.
Why do you think that is?
Well, people are just drawn to me.
You know, one of my shyest friends, I won't say his name to preserve his privacy, but he found my presence so comforting that he asked me to co-host his TV show "Anderson Cooper 360".
Given what you learned about Eleanor, do you think she deserves to be here?
Well You know, if it were up to me, I might find a way to look past her, um deficiencies, but it's not up to me, is it?
There are some criteria that she unfortunately just didn't meet in her time on Earth.
So you think that I should send her to the Bad Place?
Well, I didn't say that, but is her staying here unfair to those who earned their place?
It sounds like you want her to leave.
Well, is it not she who wants us to leave her?
Thank you, Tahani.
You've been a big help.
Listen up, genius.
He's gonna call you in there in a second.
Don't worry, I got you.
I'll just tell Michael you're the bomb and that you got a dope soul and hella ethics.
Oh, boy.
No, don't say any of that.
Michael has a lie detector in there.
It's a it's a glowing cube.
Like the AllSpark?
From "Transformers"?
Sure, uh, just like the AllSpark from "Transformers," and and he'll know instantly if you're lying about anything so only smiles and nods, got it?
Wise sage, centered Jianyu.
I seek your wisdom in this moment of crisis.
What to do with Eleanor?
Should I let her stay?
Should I send her away?
You think I should send her away?
No, I should let her stay?
Or no, I shouldn't let her stay because she doesn't belong here?
Or no, I shouldn't let her stay even though she does belong here?
Oh, Jianyu, I wish I had your wisdom.
Your devotion to the noble truths has given you something that I don't have: clarity.
It was Buddha who said, "The man lives a pure life.
Nothing can destroy him".
I'm not a man, and I've lived no life, so will this destroy me?
Ouch.
Oh, of course.
A cactus on its own intends no harm.
It's only when we interfere that it becomes dangerous.
I need to remember my own agency here.
Oh, thank you, Jianyu.
You're free to go.
Oh, yes, of course.
Help yourself.
I've got plenty of those.
Chidi, come on in.
-  - Hi there.
I have Eleanor's file.
Janet, if you hand me a cactus, - I swear I will lose my mind.
-  Oh, yes!
All right, here we go.
Eleanor, come back in.
Chidi, you stay here.
This file contains a compendium of all of the highest impact events from your life, that's the, uh, biggest positive and negative point swings.
So "Little Julie," who's that?
Julie is my cousin's daughter.
Her mom is kind of a mess, so I used to take her to the mall sometimes and bought her churro dogs.
It's a hot dog, but the bun is two churros.
And it's tied together with a Slim Jim.
It's an Arizona delicacy.
Oh, sounds awful, but it's very nice that you made that girl happy.
So what's this: "Kool Threadz, "Glendale, Arizona's Premiere T-Shirt Emporium"?
Uh, can we skip around and and circle back?
How about I tell you more about those churro dogs.
They came with unlimited ranch dressing.
Let's hear about the t-shirts, please.
Eeeh, okay.
I'll tell you, but it doesn't make me look great, so don't judge me.
That's literally the purpose of this entire exercise.
Okay, to understand this, you have to know about my roommate, Madison.
She was terrible.
Hey, Mads, um, I have to go to this stupid work party tonight.
Can I borrow your peach dress?
Aww, that's a hard no, babe.
That dress is like twice your salary.
All right, I gotta go to the DMV and pick up my vanity plates.
Ciao, bitches.
Well, that's that's not great, but I assume you confessed and paid to fix it.
Not exactly.
Hey, losers, I'm going out.
Can you zip me?
Dude, that dress is hella ripped.
- What?
-  Oh, that stupid dry cleaner!
Well, that's the risk you take when you keep - your clothes clean.
- My mom's a lawyer.
Those asswipes are gonna pay.
She sued for $900 for the dress and $80 million in emotional distress.
The legal fees drove the dry cleaner out of business.
Oh, boy.
Wait, this story's about t-shirts.
There's more, isn't there?
A little.
Check this out.
Somebody put the dry cleaners' story online, and it went viral.
Madison's famous.
The "Dress Bitch"?
Yikes.
Serves her right.
Madison is psycho.
She totally overreacted.
This is her fault.
Yeah, her fault.
That works.
You guys, what is happening?
Someone egged my Lexus, and I have like 40,000 tweets calling me the "Dress Bitch"?
Over a loser dry cleaner man?
Why is everyone so jealous of me?
This is a trash city full of idiots.
The "Dress Bitch" is so catchy.
- Yeah.
- I mean, someone could totally make t-shirts.
Ooh No, no.
No.
No.
Do not tell me that you made t-shirts that said that and then sold them for a profit?
Wish I could tell you that, bud.
I really do.
Guuurl, check it out!
They're here.
Wait a second.
Is this insane?
I mean, should we be doing this?
Dude, Madison brought this on herself, okay?
She's a nightmare of a person to everybody.
Plus, we already have a ton of pre-orders.
Here is your first cut of the profits.
Holy mama.
I can't believe you sold the t-shirts.
Does it help if they basically sold themselves?
I think you know it does not.
What did you do with the money?
Gah, I was hoping you wouldn't ask me that.
Thanks, babe.
Next question.
Eleanor.
Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place?
No, I don't.
-  - Yello, Bad Place.
What's up, dummy?
This is Michael, the architect from Good Place Neighborhood 12358W.
I'm guessing you've been looking for someone called Eleanor Shellstrop.
She's here.
Come and get her.
What is this?
What is that smell?
Get out of here!
Hello, Trevor.
Hey, there he is.
Good to see you again, Mikey.
Hey, think fast, I brought you something.
Oh, nuts, thank you.
Oh!
Oh, flaming snake ate all the nuts you brought me.
You're too nice to humiliate.
Oh, hello.
Hi, you look like a piece of crap, are are you Eleanor?
Dude, you're like a legend in the Bad Place.
You're Check this out.
- Huh?
- All: "Dress Bitch"!
It's pretty great, right?
- Trevor -  Do you know what caused this mistake?
'Cause I cannot figure it out.
No, we're stumped, but, uh, don't sweat it, champ.
She's definitely one of ours.
So we'll just roll on out, and you can get back to, uh, putting rainbows up your butt or whatever you do here.
Okay?
Let's hit it, sweetheart.
We got a long ride.
What?
Right now?
Trevor, for decency's sake, let her have some good-byes.
God, good people are the worst.
Okay, uh, 30 minutes.
We gotta get back for "The Bachelor".
I'm gonna be pissed if I miss the Rose Ceremony.
I just want to say, once more, for the record, that this whole good/bad system is bullshirt.
There should be a medium place for people like me who kind of sucked, but in, like, a fun, chill way.
I agree.
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.
And that I never did laundry.
And that I waited until you were about to do yours then secretly tossed mine into the basket to trick you into doing it.
You didn't trick me.
I repeatedly asked you to stop.
Just know you did everything you could to help me.
You're a really good fake soul mate.
What are you guys doing here?
Well, we only thought it was proper to see you off.
It's the neighborly thing to do.
You guys came to say good-bye because you're my friends.
Well, I suppose some part of me possibly has a sense of casual kinship with you.
Much as one might be fond of a street cat.
Thanks, Tahani.
Sorry about everything.
I'm really glad we're friends.
Oh, hey, dum-dum.
You ready to go?
Oh, you must be Chidi.
Trying to improve her.
Bold plan, bro.
Well, actually, she learned a great deal in - a very short amount of time - Oh, really?
Really?
I don't care.
All right, let's hit it.
Oh, also, you should smile more.
You have such a pretty smile.
Love you, babe.
Can't wait to torture you.
This is the 3:18 to the Bad Place, making thousands of stops for literally no reason.
Now, you'll notice it's very hot in here, and it will get one degree hotter every time you think about how hot it is.
Oops.
You just thought about it.
- Michael - Oh, hi, Chidi.
Want some pizza?
Bad Place crew delivered a hundred of these to my office.
All Hawaiian, the worst pizza.
Michael, I murdered Janet.
I knew about Eleanor from the beginning.
I've been trying to help her become a better person, and when she found out that your retirement meant that you would be tortured, she immediately tried to find a way to prevent it.
Eleanor is learning.
She's just doing it after she died.
I did enjoy her company.
But, this is not Little League.
There is no award for Most Improved Player, Chidi.
Well, maybe there should be.
One final note: the dining car is at the very back of the train.
It serves only room-temperature Manhattan clam chowder, and also, it's closed.
Okay, here we go.
Michael: Stop this train!
Dude, what the fork?
You're not leaving.
Not with her.
Not yet.
Come on.
Wait, you want to keep her?
Bro, that's our girl.
We agreed on this.
No, what we agreed on was that this was a mistake.
Trevor, we're in unchartered territory here.
Until we can sort this out, she stays with us.
Pff, all right, fine, but until this is resolved, we're keeping the other Eleanor.
Fine.
What?
I'm sorry - The other Eleanor?
- Yeah, the real Eleanor.
The one that was supposed to be here but got sent down to us instead?
She's on the train.
Eleanor, come on out.
Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor Shellstrop.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 I see trees of green Red roses too I see them bloom Hey, dingdongs.
We figured out what's happened here.
You two are both named Eleanor Shellstrop.
The day you died, you were both in Phoenix, Arizona shopping at the same grocery store.
Pffft.
The "real Eleanor" was attending a conference on the death penalty, and you stopped by to pick up food for a local homeless shelter.
And "fake Eleanor" was there buying margarita mix and a magazine called "Celebrity Baby Plastic Surgery Disasters".
Incredibly, you both died in the same 10,000ths of a second in the same traffic accident because Real Eleanor was trying to save Fake Eleanor's life by pushing you out of the way of the truck.
I guess you really botched that one, eh?
I did, and I am so, so sorry.
It's all good.
So how did you not realize you had the wrong Eleanor?
Oh, we don't know what people look like only names and profiles.
On Earth, they're just dots on a map.
Whatever, we got our wires crossed, we picked up the wrong dot, blah, blah, blah, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Point is, there are two Eleanors.
The nice, boring one is yours.
The trash bag is ours - So, trash bag, let's go.
- Wh Let's hit it.
And also I'm still waiting on - that smile, gorgeous.
- Trevor.
- Where's that smile?
- Trevor, how about we negotiate?
Maybe give you something else.
What in the world could you have that we would want?
All right, how about a unicorn?
Right?
I bet you don't have one of those.
No, that is true, yeah.
-  - Might be fun to skin it alive, eat its raw flesh, maybe break off the horn, grind it up, snort it.
Okay, let's keep talking.
Yeah.
Fake Eleanor, a word?
It's just me, man.
You can just say, "Eleanor".
Sorry, it just makes things easier.
Look, I'm not even sure how it would work for you to stay here now that we know there's a real Eleanor, but in the meantime, stay on your toes.
Don't let Trevor get inside your head.
Can I ask you something?
Why are you helping me?
Well, Chidi made a very good argument on your behalf, but it's more than that.
I truly believe that the Good Place is where you belong.
You're part of our team.
Hi!
Oh, you must be the new student Eleanor Shellstrop.
I'm Gloria, the senior class secretary.
Cool.
Well, welcome to Adobe High, home of the Scorpi-oties!
Half the school wanted to be the Scorpions, half wanted to be the Coyotes, so we compromised.
Why don't I give you a tour after lunch?
Yeah, no thanks, moptop.
Uh, sorry?
Don't need your help, don't wanna sign your yearbook in, like, gel pen, don't wanna bedazzle our college essays, or whatever.
I'm here for like six months, and I'm gonna fly solo.
Beat it, Gloria.
She is, like, such a dork.
She, like, loves this school so much.
Why don't you come sit with us?
We'll teach you which guys are cute and which teachers are secretly pervs, and Yeah, that's a hard pass as well.
I don't wanna get chunky highlights, make fun of nerds, and steal your mom's flavored vodka.
I get your whole "mean girl" thing, and I'm all set with it, thanks.
In fact Listen up, everyone.
I'm Eleanor, I'm new here, and as a blanket statement for everyone: I don't wanna be a part of whatever little group you've formed because they're all equally lame.
Everybody cool?
Great.
Hey, that was really cool, the way you told - all those poseurs - No.
Michael, welcome.
How can I help you?
Well, if I'm going to save Fake Eleanor, I need some help negotiating.
I don't even know what to offer.
I mean, what do you get somebody who wants to eat a unicorn?
A unicorn bib, yes!
No, no, uh, unicorn holders, you know, like like, corn holders, but for unicorns?
Perhaps, it'd be better if we just move away from the unicorn thing altogether.
No, you're right, you're right.
And anyway, there's a bigger problem: the Bad Place Crew they're all terrible bullies, and they outnumber me.
They even have their own Bad Janet.
I'll show you.
Bad Janet?
-  - What?
Bad Janet, uh, where is the nearest cafÃ©?
Oh, um, that's a good question.
It's up your mom's butt, you fat dink.
-  - What is even the purpose of a Janet who behaves in such a manner?
Unclear, but the the point is I never have to deal with negative emotion of any sort.
I could use some backup, Tahani.
Oh, Michael, of course.
Why don't you just bring them all here?
Surely this magnificent house will placate them.
Oh, perfect, perfect.
I'll be right back.
Well, here's your house.
It's beautiful I love Icelandic primitive design.
I kind of wish it had a clown nook, oh There it is.
Here's the bedroom.
It's kind of hard to get up on this dumb ledge though, it's like    You have got to be forking kidding me.
Hey, Fake Eleanor, we used this same clown painting to decorate the room you were supposed to live in down there.
I swear to Bieber.
Wait, what was your house like?
Well, I was living in what I assume is Eleanor's worst nightmare.
Every day was basically one endless baby shower for a woman I didn't know, but also somehow I had to organize it.
And if I didn't remember everyone's name, I got a very strong electric shock.
Yep, that was my pitch.
And then at night, it was pretty classic torture.
Uh, flying piranhas, lava monsters, college improv, and there was always jazz music playing.
Ugh, I hate jazz.
Every jazz song is like 40 minutes long.
It's like, we get it.
You can blow on a trumpet.
Wrap it up, Elton John.
Famously a piano player.
I don't mean to be a bother, but could I possibly get some water and whatever food doesn't turn to spiders in your mouth?
Oh, of course, so sorry.
Let's get some dinner.
Yeah, we'll all go.
Perfect double date: Two losers, a trash bag, and a demon.
Let's hit it.
Eeh!
All right, Michael, we're going to ply them with delicious food and drink, and then we're going to subtly segue into negotiation.
They're sure to be in a good mood.
Everything is absolutely beautiful.
This sucks, dude.
Yeah, this food, uh, blows.
Yo, Good Janet.
-  - Hi, there.
Oh, huh, gimme some jalapeÃ±o poppers.
Sure, quick question: what is a "jalapeÃ±o"?
Also: what is a "poppers"?
Also: what is "jalapeÃ±o poppers"?
Oops, sorry, guys.
Uh, see, in the confusion, Janet got rebooted, so she hasn't quite uploaded all of the info she usually knows.
That's hilarious.
She's almost as stupid as people.
Oh, hey now, come on.
Let's not insult people, please.
Uh, I'm Michael, - I love, uh, idiot humans!
-  I gotta admit that does sound like me.
"I got to admit that does sound like me".
- Oh, nailed it again.
-  Go get me a drink.
Yes, of course.
Aw, man, this is gonna make a primo dump later on.
Well, that looks delicious.
What is that?
Oh, it's Tom Yum Goong soup.
It reminds me of when I was in Thailand rescuing victims of human trafficking.
Ooh, that sounds so good.
I mean, um, the soup, not the human trafficking.
Oh, and I think your grilled eggplant looks so good.
Should we -  Splitsies?
- Yeah!
I can't believe you thought you could pretend to be Real Eleanor.
She's like a perfect ball of light, and you're like a wet pile of mulch.
Someone made a person out of wet mulch and leaves and, like, dead slugs, and that's you.
Whatever, it's easy when you're just born perfect.
My parents were both dirtbags who split up when I was eight.
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but did you say your parents got a divorce?
Yeah, and that kind of thing really changes a person.
I mean, that trauma It can explain away a lot of behavior.
Oh, of course.
Your parents are still together, I guess.
Oh, actually, um, I I'm not sure.
I never met my birth parents.
They put me in an empty fish tank and abandoned me at a train station in Bangladesh.
-  - Luckily, I was found and adopted by a very nice couple, the Shellstrops - Oh, thank God.
- But then they died when I was four bird flu.
- That's awful.
- Anyway, orphanage burned down, yadda yadda yadda, made my way to America, yadda yadda yadda, learned English from watching "Seinfeld," put myself through law school, and here I am.
Huh.
And, I'm sorry, what What is it you said happened to you?
The same thing that happens to half of all kids in America?
And for you to have gone through all that, and to end up where you did, it is just It's just amazing.
Oh, man, these horndogs are vibing like mofos.
Am I right, Fake Eleanor?
Please, stop calling me that.
Oh, you got it, third wheel.
Yeah, that wine's no good.
I'm sending it back.
Hey, Janet.
You look sad.
People keep asking me questions that I don't know the answers to.
That was my whole life on Earth.
You know, it doesn't matter if you know things.
All that matters is what's in your heart.
Thanks, Jianyu.
I mean, it does matter if I know things, because I'm an informational delivery system, and I don't have a heart, but thanks.
Jianyu, I know usually you ask me questions, but can I ask you a question?
Sure.
What are jalapeÃ±o poppers?
Oh, I know this one!
Okay, they're deep fried jalapeÃ±os filled with cheese.
- Hm.
- One time, at a Buffalo Wild Wings in Jacksonville, but the nice one, not the one above the gas station, I ate 50 of them in two minutes.
Everyone at the hospital was so impressed.
Got it.
Thanks, Jianyu.
You're welcome.
Why did you do that?
Because you're the only person here that's nice to me.
Okay.
Anyone up for a little, uh, icebreaker?
You know, I once did trust falls with Barry Diller, and it was the beginning of a lifelong friendship.
And then once we trust each other, then we can discuss making a deal for Fake Eleanor.
This sucks.
How do you guys eat without listening to hard-core porn?
Oh, come on, this is the Good Place, you can do anything you want.
What about throwing a rager and totally trashing this place?
Whoo-hoo, yeah, I'd be into that.
Mm, we could totally go to town.
You know, I actually don't think that's such a good idea.
Let's party!
Who let the dogs out?
- Who who who who?
- Oh, my God!
Who let the dogs out?
Who who who So, um, Chidi tells me that he's teaching you about ethics.
Yeah, actually, we've had some interesting and in-depth classes.
He taught me about Plato - and Socrates, Immanuel Kant - Yeah, cool, shut up.
Let's cut to the chase here You two go to Poundtown?
Poundtown, bro.
You two bang it out?
She hot for teach?
Did you pork the dork?
C'mon, girl, dish me dem dirty deets.
I assure you, our relationship was "teacher-student," nothing more.
Chidi, you don't have to explain anything to me.
Whatever happened before I arrived is none of my business.
Hey, I'd love to see the rest of the neighborhood.
Uh, yes, it's it's incredible.
Um, there's an amazing library, there's a beautiful, - piranha-free lake.
-  Well, please, show me everything.
You ready, Eleanor?
I've seen it all already.
You guys go ahead.
You'd rather be alone with him?
Fire in the hole watch your heads, ladies.
My dudes tend to boomerang around the room.
Yeah, I mean, I don't need to walk around and nerd out about old books.
I'm good.
Okay.
Hey, a bunch of us are gonna go see "Spider-Man 2" tonight.
Do you want to come?
They made a second "Spider-Man"?
What is there left to say?
Sure, whatever, I'm in.
Cool, okay, well, I'll get tickets for the eight of us, and you can just pay me back in cash.
So you can get all the points on your credit card, and the rest of us get screwed?
- No way.
- No, it's just so we can all get tickets before they sell out.
Do you want to buy them?
So you guys can never pay me back, and I'll be out like 80 bucks?
Nice try.
I'll buy my own ticket.
The rest of the group can do whatever they want.
Where did she end up?
Bought it with points, baby.
My points.
I think I need to find a new place to live.
-  - Oh no, no, no, no.
Don't Don't All right.
Ha.
Want a bump?
No, thank you, I I don't use cocaine.
Oh, it's not cocaine, idiot.
We're snorting time.
Sorry you're snorting the concept of time?
Yeah, it'll fork you up.
Yo, monk dude, you know how to tap a keg?
- Karaoke time!
- Whoo!
Dana, baby, what do you wanna do?
Okay, Mussolini's speech?
Ooh, the Mel Gibson rant?
- That's a classic.
- Classic Ooh, let's do - the Nixon Tapes that's my jam!
- Yeah!
"What you always have to "remember about the Irish is they get mean.
"Virtually every Irish I've known gets mean - when he drinks".
-  Whoo!
Michael, tell them to stop.
Oh, I think I made it pretty clear that I don't approve.
Hey, idiot.
Dance.
You got it.
"Oh, it's about damn time that the Jew in America realizes he's an American first and a Jew second".
I lighted him on fire, and he never spoke again.
You know, maybe I'm not as great as Real Eleanor, but I'm better than I used to be.
I'm medium-good.
Why haven't you forkers invented a medium place?
Look, I know you've been trying to become a "better person," I mean, you didn't want to get caught.
I get it.
But I read your file You don't belong here.
I mean, she spent her weekends breaking up dog fighting rings.
You once saw a meter maid writing you a ticket, and you barked like a dog till she ran away.
I mean, honestly, you'll be happier in the Bad Place.
I mean, don't get me wrong, you'll be miserable.
We will torture you, but you'll also be happier because you won't have to keep trying to fit in somewhere you just don't belong.
A'ight.
Let's go.
Okay, hold on, I have to ask: is this thing gonna happen?
- You and me?
- Ew, no, gross.
Okay, you know I had to ask, babe.
Oh, Tahani, I'm so sorry.
I will obviously clean all of this up.
I don't care about the house, Michael.
I'm just upset that you let them walk all over you.
I know they're the only thing in the Universe that scares me.
I know what I have to do.
I just have to be more accommodating.
Offer them everything they want, give in to all of their demands, and then they'll have to respect me.
No, you need to stand up for yourself.
I'm going to tell you the same thing that I told Mark Zuckerberg right before he ousted Eduardo Saverin.
You are smart, you are capable, and the time has come to hit "unfriend".
I also told Mark to lose the "the".
Just "Facebook".
That was me.
Oh Oh, my head.
Here, drink this.
How am I hung over?
I thought there were no hangovers here.
Well, the Bad Place Crew requested the hangover filter be turned off.
They like them.
So, Michael said we're meeting at Tahani's place in an hour for a negotiation session.
We'll walk over together?
You don't have to come, man.
I'm good.
Just hang out with Real Eleanor and name constellations after each other, or whatever it is nerds do.
I'm fine on my own.
Yeah, Eleanor, just because we have a new guest in the house doesn't mean I'm not still gonna be there for you.
I'm in this.
We're a team.
So you've been temping for us for a year now, and we want to bring you aboard permanently.
We think you'd be a great addition to the team.
Yeah, no.
Uh, I'm good.
You're turning it down?
I just don't think I'm really one of you guys.
You're all obsessed with this place, man.
You love working here and talking about working here, and you all hang out like some kind of cult.
We hang out after work because we're friends.
I know.
It's weird.
If this is how you really feel, I I think I have to fire you.
Severance pay.
Love it.
Good looking out, boss.
Peace!
You need me to lie to old people and scare them into buying fake allergy medicine.
I get it, man.
Which one's my desk?
That one, over there.
All you gotta do is hit your minimal sales target every week.
Cool.
And you guys don't have any lame, mandatory office hangouts, right?
Hell no.
Some people go out for a drink after work, and I like to run the occasional group drill to see how fast we can shred evidence, but that's it.
Most days, you'll be able to avoid even talking to another person here.
Perfect.
Happy to be a part of the not-team.
It'll be a pleasure not hanging out with you.
All right, let's begin negotiations.
Now, we would like to discuss various trades that we could Oh, yeah, we're not negotiating.
See, Fake Eleanor and I, we bro-ed down pretty hard last night.
We hooked up.
No, we didn't.
Yeah, but who are they gonna believe me or a woman?
Point is she knows that she doesn't belong here, and she's giving up.
Is this true?
Fake Eleanor, are you giving up?
Yeah, of course she is.
She knows this place isn't for her.
Let's go, dingdong.
Come on.
No, I'm not leaving.
Oh, come on, sweetheart, we've been through this.
You know you don't belong here.
You're right.
I don't But I want to.
I used to never want to be a part of any group, but I'm a different person now because of the person who helped me, and I want to be like him.
I want to be like all the people who are here.
You can, Eleanor.
Thanks, Real Eleanor.
Hey, if you two aren't gonna make out, just shut up.
Look, if you don't come with us, we're gonna have to turn this matter over to Shawn.
Oh, oh, no, um, Shawn, really?
Wha uh, who's Who's Shawn?
He's the wise, eternal Judge who sits on high, has the final say on all disputes between our two realms.
And his name is "Shawn"?
Okay, look, I don't want Shawn involved either, so how about you blow us away with an offer so we can end this.
Okay Here's my offer.
You get nothing.
We're not letting Fake Eleanor go, and we're not giving you anything.
Get him, Michael!
You can summon every evil creature you have, every weapon in your arsenal, every four-headed flying bear they have them down there but we are not giving up.
I believe that Eleanor belongs in the Good Place.
If I'm wrong, you can take her to the Bad Place and punish her all you want, just really go to town on her.
Gah, gah, gah, easy, buddy, easy.
But she's staying here.
Now, all of you Get the fork out of my neighborhood.
You're on borrowed time, Fake Eleanor.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Let's roll, dummies.
Let's get one drink for the road.
- Bye.
- Did you guys hear any of that?
-  - Oh, my Bravo, Michael, really.
Hello, Jianyu.
You got sloppy.
I found your junk food all over the house, and then, last night, you knew how to tap a keg.
So I thought I would come in here and investigate your little "meditation" den.
What I found was this.
Now, I don't know who you are, but I do know that you're not a Buddhist monk.
So let's chat, shall we?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 Number five is number one.
Number seven is number two.
Number three and number four are tied for number three.
What are you talking about?
I'm ranking my favorite "Fast and the Furious" movies.
You said you wanted to know who I am, and this is the best way to get to know me.
No, it isn't.
You could tell me your real name, for starters.
My name is Jason Mendoza.
I'm from Florida.
And I'm a professional amateur DJ.
And is, uh, that a family member?
I wish.
That's Ariana Grande, the sexiest woman alive.
You wish that you were related to a woman you want to have sex with.
You know what?
It'd be one thing if you just weren't a Buddhist monk, but you're barely even a regular, functioning person.
How did you get here?
I don't know, but, please, dawg, you can't tell Michael about me.
You have some nerve asking me for favors when you have spent weeks deceiving me, making a fool out of me, and bringing snack food into my house.
Disgusting.
Oh, Ariana, we're really in it now.
Shawn, the judge, could show up at any moment, so we need to have a rock-solid argument for why Fake Eleanor should not be sent to the Bad Place.
- Should be fun.
- That's the spirit!
Don't even think about the fact that our slightest misstep could cause Fake Eleanor to suffer for eternity.
That's all I'm thinking about now.
Yep, shouldn't have said that.
Regretted it immediately.
Bambadjan was a human rights advocate, so he and Real Eleanor will build a sort of legal argument.
Um, ahem, could you please just say "Eleanor," and maybe point to whichever one of us you're addressing?
Well, actually, the fake/real distinction helps me.
Oh, does it, Bambadjan?
Now, I know a fair amount about your time on Earth.
Why don't you tell me about your time here?
Anything that might help your case.
Well, in the first 24 hours, I caused the world to erupt into chaos, and then I caused a garbage storm.
It was kind of a rough start, but things calmed down after Chidi started helping me learn about ethics.
Okay, tell me about that.
Well, I studied with Chidi every day, and then Chidi got sick of me, so I did some nice stuff to make him feel better.
And later, I confessed because Chidi was being tortured by guilt, and I just felt awful seeing his little, nerdy face all contorted.
Oh, Eleanor, I have a stomachache because of what you did.
He is such a dork.
You know, a lot of death row inmates feel regret about things they never said admissions of guilt or anger or love.
Are you making a move on me?
It's fine I just didn't see it coming.
Uh, well, hooking up with someone with the exact same name, it is kind of a fun, narcissistic fantasy - No, no, Eleanor, I I'm talking - I could be into it.
Mm, no, I'm talking about you and Chidi.
Now, ordinarily, you having feelings for my soul mate would be - a conflict of interest - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I'm into Chidi?
Yes, Eleanor, I do.
Because you are.
You mentioned his name nine times in the last ten minutes.
Nobody asked you, Bambadjan.
I'm not sure what will work with Shawn, but we should have all our bases covered.
Shall we start with the Greeks or would you prefer the modern British masters?
Chidi?
I'm sorry, choices are hard for me when I'm under pressure.
I know that, buddy, but we're short of time here, and it's kind of important for Eleanor.
Right, which is why I can't take this lightly.
What if I screw up?
Listen, I don't need the Chidi who once had a panic attack during Rock-Paper-Scissors because there were, and I quote, "just too many variables".
I need the Chidi who stormed in here and told me to stop Eleanor's train without thinking of consequences.
Oh, boy, now I'm nervous about that decision.
Retroactively?
I mean, h how do you even?
I don't know.
Okay, we have so many big choices to make.
Let's let's start small.
Do you want to use a dry erase board or the regular pen and paper?
Just pick.
Chidi, just pick!
Come on, Chidi, pick someone.
Don't pressure me, Uzo.
I have to consider all the factors.
Athletic strategies, the fragile egos of my classmates, and gender politics.
Should I pick a girl as a gesture towards women's equality, or or is that pandering?
Or do I think it's pandering because of my limited male point of view?
I'm vexed, Uzo, vexed.
You're always vexed.
Just pick.
Okay, fine, uh, I choose Tokunbo.
You can't draft the teacher.
Pick a kid.
all: Come on, Chidi.
Just pick someone.
Congratulations, Chidi.
You filibustered recess.
No, no, no, you're wrong.
There are way more things I hate about Chidi than like about him.
Like what?
His stupid Clark Kent glasses, his extensive turtleneck collection, oh, and he loves ethics so much.
He once talked about John Rawls for two hours I timed it.
And he only stopped because he saw me timing him.
Granted, he laughed, and kind of made fun of himself, it was a nice moment, but still.
He always twitches his eyebrows when he says "absolutism," and he tilts his head whenever I say anything ignorant, but he never makes fun of me, which is nice.
He's also incredibly patient, and kind, and surprisingly jacked, and, oh, fork, I'm in love with Chidi.
Let's take a little break.
I know this is awkward, but as your advocate, and, I hope, friend, I think you should tell Chidi how you feel.
Would a hug make you feel better?
- No, I don't think that it would - Oh, too late, you're getting one.
Thanks, Bambadjan, that does make me feel better.
Mm-hmm.
Yet another lie.
You didn't paint this.
You got Janet to do it.
No, no, no, Chidi did it.
I got you an awesome painting, but then he switched it to this one because he said you'd like it more, and he made me memorize stuff to say to you so you wouldn't be so sad.
This is all his fault.
You should yell at him.
Chidi helped you make me happy.
It's almost as if he was trying to Oh, oh, my.
Of course.
This is the cool painting I made.
This guy's famous.
I mean, who even are those ladies?
Yeah, it would be easier to sort out the issue of dry erase versus paper if I could write down the pros and cons for each, but, of course, I would have to use one of them to write down the pros and cons for them, which is problematic.
Wow.
Ethics team, how's it going?
- Terribly.
- Cool.
Well, you guys are kind of my last hope, so that's not great.
-  - Hey, do you mind if I borrow Professor Stomachache here for a second?
Please, take him for an hour, take all the time you want.
Okay, sit down, maybe.
I dated many annoying guys, okay?
They would call me all times of the day "just to talk" or ask me if I'd taken cash out of their wallets, stupid stuff.
And when I stopped having fun with them, I'd leave.
Usually wouldn't even call or anything.
I'd just bounce.
Gotta go spend that money you stole.
Point is, you are way more of a buzzkill than any of those dudes.
Okay, thanks for this conversation.
But, somehow, I never want to leave you.
I want to stay in the Good Place because of you.
Because I love you.
I think.
No, I'm pretty sure.
Yeah, I love you.
Ugh, that's embarrassing.
I feel so itchy.
Sorry.
Don't say anything.
I just needed to get that off my chest.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Catch you later, silly Billy.
Ugh, love has made me a nerd.
Bye.
Jianyu's a fake.
He's not supposed to be here.
Just like your "soul mate".
More importantly, you did the ballerina painting 'cause you were trying to protect my feelings, because you love me.
Oh, Chidi, don't you see?
This is the real mistake that was made in our neighborhood.
You and I are soul mates.
It makes so much sense.
- Oh, but - No, Chidi, true love is rare, like a desert flower betwixt two oases, but true love's also very simple.
And right now, I'm just a girl towering over a boy asking him to admit he loves me.
I feel like her confession of love was a lot better than mine.
Can I get a do-over?
I need to step outside for some air, and I will not be back for many days.
Dude, you can't just run away.
You have to  It looks calm now, but the storm is imminent.
- We're - What's up, Carson Daly?
My name is Jason.
I wanna give a shout-out to all my homies up in Jacksonville.
I am not Carson Daly.
I'm a weather reporter.
A hurricane is coming.
You need seek shelter.
- I'm on TV!
- Okay.
- Hey, Janet?
-  Hi, there.
What are you watching?
My greatest accomplishment ever.
I'm trying to cheer myself up because I'm sad.
I think I might be in big trouble.
Can you bring me something that will make me not-sad?
Let me think.
-  - Sorry that took so long.
Here you go.
Oh, dang.
Are these from my favorite restaurant, Stupid Nick's Wing Dump?
Stupid Nick's closed down because a pelican fell in the flash fryer, but he opened a new place called Ugly Nick's Meat Trench.
These are an exact replica of that recipe.
Why are you so nice to me?
Well, you were very nice to me while I was rebooting.
Also, I'm programmed to be nice to everyone.
Janet?
I just realized something.
I love you.
Okay.
I have one more question for you.
So you also love Chidi, and you you just told him, just now, right before I did?
Technically, you told him that he loves you, but yes.
This isn't ideal.
We must remain civil.
He's simply going to have to pick one of us, and the loser will just have to accept her fate with grace and equanimity.
Maybe if you lose.
If he doesn't pick me, I'ma start throwing stuff.
Classy as always.
I suppose you knew that Jianyu was a fake, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Figured you two charlatans would sniff each other out like two mangy rats sharing a pizza crust in a sewer Okay no.
We're not gonna do this.
We are not gonna be those women who fight over a guy and find any excuse to rip each other apart.
I am not going to apologize for being angry.
You knew that my soul mate was lying to me.
Yes, I did, and I'm very sorry.
Listen, you and I have a weird, complicated, forked-up friendship, but it's our friendship, and I care about it.
Let's do something fun.
What would make you feel happy, right now?
You have a fine home, Deirdre I absolutely adore your shares.
I don't know bugger all about a shares I been using this as a bloody toilet, I have.
-  - What's this show called, again?
It's "Deirdre and Margaret".
It ran for 16 years on the BBC.
They did nearly 30 episodes.
It's about two women from very different worlds who become friends, sort of like us.
Oh, Deirdre, no!
That's priceless art!
I thought it was fruit, innit?
Deirdre.
I take it the moron is me?
Well, it's not a direct parallel.
Okay, we did your thing.
Now it's my turn.
Are you ready to take our bonding to the next level?
Oh, good, you're back.
Yeah, I, uh, I know we're short on time, but I need your help with a personal dilemma.
This is about Fake Eleanor and Real Eleanor.
Yes, which person is my soul mate?
Real Eleanor, that's what the system determined.
- Okay.
- Of course, the system did screw up by letting Fake Eleanor in.
You know, it's interesting.
Fake Eleanor being selected accidentally and then you bonding with her could have shifted the formula.
Right, it's one of those two people.
Well, I d I don't know.
I mean, the system might be so screwed up at this point that maybe you don't belong to either Eleanor.
Oh - You is spreading - What?
Your indecisiveness is infecting me like a virus.
Oh, Chidi, this could send us down a very dangerous path.
If you can't make a choice, this whole neighborhood could fall apart.
Okay, getting close here.
Just mulling the ethical ramifications of various soups.
Ah, same old Chidi.
I can come back for a fifth time.
Yeah, you know, maybe that's smart.
How are you?
Uzo, it's been too long.
It has, it has.
Look, as you know, Ellen and I are engaged.
You're my oldest friend, and I love you like a brother, and that's why I'd like you to not be my best man.
- Sorry?
- Look, if you were my best man, you'd have to plan the bachelor party, decide what to say in your toast, handle problems that pop up the day of.
It would drive you up the wall.
Well, Uzo, this isn't choosing soccer teams on a playground.
When something's important to me, I can make a decision.
Watch.
Um, excuse me, excuse me.
I have decided I would like to unequivocally order the pumpkin soup.
Perfect.
You kind of want to change your order.
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.
- Excuse me, Risotto.
Risotto?
- Yeah.
As much as I'm enjoying this, shouldn't we be working on your case to try and stay here?
Honestly, how am I gonna help them?
They are much smarter than me.
Now, hair extensions?
This is where I shine.
You were already at almost-maximum hotness, but now you look like a sexy, tan Rapunzel.
Ugh, the dream.
And how exactly did you learn how to do this?
When I was 14, I had to make myself look older to get a job.
These were the ones I used, and they are real cheap.
You're gonna want to stay away from open flames and altercations at outlet malls.
Hey I'm really sorry that I didn't tell you about Jianyu and that you got saddled with him.
Yes, that is regrettable, but I forgive you.
Maybe you two are soul mates.
Holy shirt.
Maybe we are.
I know it seems crazy, but but think about it: Jianyu is a hot dummy, definitely my type.
We both love to dance, we were both banned from public transit systems in our cities.
I think this is the answer.
People come in pairs here, and if the system paired us up, then maybe somehow I do belong here with him.
-  - Hi, there.
Jason and I are getting married in ten minutes, and you're invited.
Here, we've got your soul mate options: Eleanor, Real Eleanor, and a theoretical third person.
Let's call her strawberry mango twist.
Okay, close your eyes.
Think about each of the women.
Open your eyes.
The answer is Real Eleanor.
- How do you know?
- I don't, but the minute I said that, you knew instinctively whether it felt right.
Well, hang on, let me think about that.
- No, no.
- Because it No more thinking, Chidi.
Just do something.
Indecision caused you so much agony in your life, right up to the very end.
I had a little trouble writing my speech.
Um I wrote 11 different versions.
Wedding's in 20 minutes, buddy.
Oh, boy, I mean, these run about 55 minutes a piece.
I'm really hot.
Is this air conditioner even working?
Yes, it is.
You're just having a literal meltdown.
Also, you're not dressed yet, and we haven't picked up the rings.
Okay, well, uh, there's an issue there involving what I consider to be unfair labor practices - on the part of the jeweler.
- And we never had a bachelor party because you could never settle on a location or time.
I'm sorry, you were right.
This is too much for me.
You should just leave me here and go get married.
Yeah, here's the thing, bud: my wedding isn't for another month.
This was a test to see if you could handle being my best man, and, just as I predicted, you failed, miserably.
Oh, no.
No, I mean, I'm I'm relieved, but this is embarrassing.
It's okay, bud.
Obviously, I prepared for this.
Let's just go have a nice night.
I'll buy you a beer.
30 minutes, Chidi?
We have been trying to pick a bar for 30 minutes.
It is literally impossible to be your friend.
You're incapable of making a single decision.
Look, I know I can be indecisive, but what's the harm in taking a few extra minutes to find the perfect   Chidi?
You're right.
I just need to make a decision.
I'm gonna look each of these women in the eye, trust my gut, and figure out how I feel.
You're kidding.
That worked?
Great!
Go do it!
Ha!
Man on speaker: Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to married.
Yo, check it.
This is great.
At different moments during our time here, we both thought that Tragic Mike over here was our one true love, and now he is marrying whatever Janet is.
I suppose you're right.
It is a bit strange.
I'd like to read a poem.
"Janet, my digital queen.
"Janet, we can dare to dream.
Send nude pics of your heart to me".
-  - "Jacksonville Jaguars rule"!
Jason, when I was rebooted, and I lost all my knowledge, I was confused and disoriented, but you were always kind to me.
And according to the central theme of 231,600 songs, movies, poems, and novels that I researched for these vows in the last three seconds, that's what love's all about.
Does anybody here object to this marriage?
- Of course we do how could - Yes, it is a terrible idea.
- we not object?
- Overruled.
- Jason?
- Mm-hmm?
Do you want me to be your wife?
- Yeah.
- I want you to be my husband.
- Tight.
- So, by the power vested in me, by me, I now pronounce us husband and wife.
- We did it!
-  Can I kiss you, or will I be electrocuted?
Only one way to find out.
Whoo, get some!
Got get it, girl!
I'm just going with it now.
It's funny I was devastated when I found out that he wasn't my soul mate, but now I think I've dodged a bullet.
He's a simple man.
I once watched him eat electrical tape right off the roll.
He thought it was a Fruit by the Foot that had gone bad.
Thank you for being such a great friend to me today.
'Course, hot stuff.
I got your back.
Eleanor, hey, I just wanted to see if you'd talked to Chidi.
Uh, yeah, I did.
I mean, you don't have to tell me what you said.
I just wanted to see if you're okay.
Oh, man, you are a good person.
I swear, if I had known you and Tahani and Chidi on Earth, I might have for real gotten into the Good Place.
Oh, hey, it's my three favorite yogurts.
Hey, um, about what happened earlier I've been kind of all over the place today.
An hour ago, I thought Jianyu was my soul mate, and the fact that that kind of made sense means you and I could never be meant for each other.
Plus, Jianyu's married to Janet now.
Okay.
What?
I do love you, but I think more in a best friend afterlife savior kind of way.
I'm not so much "hot for teacher" as I am "eternally grateful for semi-cute, surprisingly ripped teacher".
Chidi, I also have to apologize.
It's just that when I found out that Jianyu wasn't my soul mate, I-I desperately needed something to keep me afloat, and, well, you were the nearest lifeboat, as it were.
And yes, we do have the sort of connection that only two highly educated, sophisticates could have, but it's not true love.
True love is what Janet and Jianyu have.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, we would love to stay and chat, but we need to find Michael.
Eleanor, I think I figured out a way for you to stay.
-  - Really?
I I'll come too.
Digital digital get down - Just you and me - What?
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Now, I'm about to show you some very sensitive information.
The final point totals each of you achieved for all your actions on Earth.
Whoa, your point total was crazy high, Eleanor.
Oh, sorry, "Crazy High Eleanor" was my nickname in college.
I accidentally saw these point totals when Michael was fixing the sinkhole.
It gave me an idea.
We will apply the formula to Eleanor's actions here in the Good Place, and if you earn enough new points, then we could argue that you should stay here.
- Would that work?
- Don't know, never had to prove someone belonged here before.
But the judge will be here soon, and this is the best way to build our case.
Now, the average point total for a resident here is roughly 1.2 million.
Right now, based on everything that you did on Earth, you have -4,008.
That's not great, but I'm gonna do nice things for every goober in this place until my point total is so high I can rub it in all their smug faces.
-  - You just lost five points.
Hello!
Hi, how are you?
There has to be something bigger I can do than holding the door and waving.
There's no way every Walmart greeter is in the Good Place.
Wal mart?
It's a place regular people go.
- You haven't heard of it.
- Look, I know this is tedious, but holding a door for someone is three points, and if you do it for everyone in the neighborhood, then that's almost a thousand points for just a start.
Besides, all the big ticket items are impossible, I'm afraid.
It's not as if you could, you know, "sacrifice your life to save others" or "change the consciousness of a nation".
Both of which I did, by the way.
Such fun.
Have a wonderful day.
This is pointless.
The ticker isn't even going up, and everyone's giving me the stink eye.
Eleanor, everyone hates you.
Well, fork you too.
No, this is good.
Now that we know, we can actually do something about it.
And I am an expert at mediating conflict, like when my friends Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby had an issue with my other friend Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Yeah, I don't know what I love more about our morning hardboiled egg routine, the eggs or the routine.
Um, actually, this morning, there's a little surprise in yours.
"I love you".
How cute.
I love you too, egg.
Oh, no, no, Chidi, that that's me saying that to you.
I love you.
Ohh.
Well, that is something.
I know you've gone through a lot, and now I'm throwing this at you, but I just I had to tell you how I feel.
I love you.
No need to respond.
- Great.
- Well, at some point, you'll respond, right?
I just meant no rush.
You wanna talk about eggs again?
Hmm, this isn't right.
I'm sorry, I've never kissed anyone before.
Is one tongue okay?
I can add more tongues.
No, that's not it.
We're married now, but we still haven't told your dad.
Once again, Michael is not my dad, and we shouldn't tell him.
If Michael finds out that we're married, then he'll know you're not Tahani's soul mate, and then he'll know that you're really Jason and not Jianyu.
He'd send you to the Bad Place.
Mm, I don't want to lose you, girl.
- I'm not a girl.
- But also, I'm tired of living a lie.
We gotta go public.
I hate all this hiding.
I want us to have the life we deserve.
Pillboi, let's talk big picture.
You know I love Jacksonville.
J-town.
It's easily one of the top ten swamp cities in northeastern Florida, but if we're gonna make it in the DJ game, we gotta get to Miami.
Miami's expensive.
We just don't got that skrilla, B. I mean, I got ten bucks to my name, and I spent eight of it on this burrito, and the other two on guac.
I know what we gotta do.
We're gonna rob this restaurant.
Great idea!
What if we get caught?
We'll just get married so that no one can testify against us.
Dope.
Yo.
I got diarrhea.
I'll be right back.
Me too.
I'll race you.
both: Best friends!
Thank you all for participating in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.
Think of this as an open forum for you to air any and all grievances that you may carry against her.
I was flying on the second day, and when you caused the trash storm, I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass, and it exploded.
- Oh, dear.
- All this cartilage and bone got tangled up in my hair, and its skin was all over my skin.
I didn't know where I ended and the turkey carcass began.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, your skin looks amazing.
My cafÃ© got destroyed by the giant frog, then I reopened it and it fell into the sinkhole.
Just like me, I fell in too.
Who else feels that Eleanor has ruined every moment of your existence since you arrived?
Excellent.
I must confer with Eleanor for a tick, so please, just enjoy the lemonade and cookies.
It seems everyone's problem with me is me.
Yes, it would appear that way.
The last moment they were happy was at my party.
We have to recreate that party.
We have to take them back to that night before I started affecting the neighborhood and give them a fresh start.
Yes, of course.
We must throw the perfect party, or else you'll be tortured by demons forever.
This will be the fourth most important party I have ever thrown.
Janet, there you are.
Some residents are complaining that you're not responding I'm sorry, what's going on?
Is that a a wedding ring?
Yes.
I'm married.
- To whom?
- Sorry, my protocol forbids me from telling you any private information about any resident.
Is it that person?
Jianyu, the man standing right there also wearing a wedding band?
Dad we need to talk.
I just want to make sure that I have this right.
Um Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk, but rather someone named Jason Mendoza, a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida.
I wasn't a failed DJ.
I was pre-successful.
And you two are married.
Hells yeah, homie.
We love each other.
She makes the bass drop in my heart.
And Jason is a person who was near me, and then he asked me to marry him, and there is nothing in my protocol that specifically barred that from happening.
- So I agreed.
- Love you too, babe.
Janet.
Please tell me how this could have happened.
Unclear.
As you know, each time I am updated, I accrue new knowledge and abilities.
My suspicion is that when I was rebooted, I bonded with Jason in a way that I have never bonded with anyone before.
I seem to have gained a new understanding of love.
I also learned how to do this.
I will speak to you later.
Go to your void.
- Okay.
-  - No, Janet, come back!
-  - Hi there.
- Go.
- Sure thing.
-  - No!
- Stop doing that.
-  - Me?
- Go!
- Good-bye.
- Janet, come back.
- I love you.
I love you too.
That is Sachveer, and his problem with me is Oh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him.
It's gonna be hard to keep a straight face tonight.
Hey, can I ask your advice on something?
Are you sure, dude?
Isn't there someone else better you could ask, like literally anyone else?
Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you you do know me pretty well.
So here it is: Real Eleanor said she loves me.
Hey, man, nice pull.
She's a great person.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, we are soul mates, so I probably do love her, but then again, how do I know if my motivation is correct?
Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her, but if I tell her that I love her for the wrong reasons, it won't mean anything.
You have a tendency to over-think things.
Turn off that giant brain, and just say you love her too.
- You think?
- If this were some random person you hooked up with at a Diamondbacks game in the parking lot behind the port-a-potties not based on a real example I would say keep mulling, but this is your soul mate.
She's Universe-approved.
Tell her you love her.
Hey, your score just went up 20 points.
Yeah, 'cause I give great advice.
Now maybe you'll finally listen to me and take off those glasses.
We are in the afterlife, dummy, nature's Lasik.
Okay.
I think I figured this out.
There is a real Jianyu, a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence at the age of eight.
But, three months ago, he went into such a deep meditative state that he registered as dead, and when you died at that exact same moment, our system mistook you for him.
Perhaps because you share the exact same IQ.
- Cool.
- No, not cool.
He stopped learning at the age of seven.
Okay, so, now, this is sort of a quick litmus test, basic questions designed to tell whether you were fundamentally good or bad.
Number one: Did you ever commit a serious crime?
Yes, I blew up a guy's speedboat after he sued me.
And I stole an old lady's fake leg once on a dare.
Did you ever have a personalized license plate?
Yeah, dawg.
- "I LUV BUTTS".
-  Have have you ever paid money to hear music performed by California funk rock band the Red Hot Chili Peppers?
Yo, the Chilis?
I saw them in concert like 50 times.
-  - I once got arrested trying to steal Flea's bass guitar.
Oh, that was another serious crime I committed.
I should have mentioned that earlier.
-  - Is it just me, or am I acing this test?
Oh, this is bad.
Oh, this is so, so bad.
Oh, I thought I had everything under control when I found Eleanor, but somehow you are you're so much worse.
No, don't don't touch Oh How does that still work?
Everything's gonna be fine, homie.
I promise.
I don't know, B. What if it doesn't work?
Hey, we thought of everything except for an alibi and an escape route, but we'll figure it out as we go.
You don't wanna over-think these things.
- I'm kinda freaking out here.
- Pillboi, I got you.
This plan is foolproof.
And when it's over, we can finally have the lives we deserve.
DiGiorno!
I am a safe installer here to install-a da safe.
So just a-point to where the guacamole money is, and I'll-a install-a da safe-a in da, how you say, a-place?
Yeah, hi, we're being robbed.
J, they're on to us, man.
His hat's a golf ball, and he's a got a terrible mustache.
We need to get married now.
I do, for always and forever.
I do!
Eleanor, for an utter novice, you have thrown a lovely party.
Well, thanks, but it's not working.
Not one more point.
What the fork?
Oh, look, Michael's here.
He can help.
Michael, would you do us the honor of saying a few words?
I don't know that I'm in the right frame of mind.
Please, they'll listen to you.
Just pay me a few compliments.
You know, I'm great, heart of a champion, basically your muse, you get it.
Attention, everyone.
Michael would like to say a few words.
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you all here, mingling around with your various secrets.
Who really knows which of you are who you say you are?
No way to know unless I pull your skeletons out, right?
Okay.
Take her easy.
Yes, well said.
Now, we shall hear from tonight's featured guest.
She's kind, she's humble, she's the Walmart of friends.
Did I use that word right?
Eleanor Shellstrop.
Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.
Original flavor, not new and improved.
I know a lot of bad stuff has happened because of me, but I never meant to hurt you, so if I caused you any harm, I'm truly sorry.
That's nice, Eleanor, but I still crashed into a turkey carcass.
And I fell into a sinkhole.
And my dog got kicked into the sun.
What can you possibly say to us that'll make up for your actions?
Pobody's nerfect?
"Pobody's nerfect"?
That's hilarious.
Like "nobody's perfect," but the letters switched.
- That's very funny.
- It's nerfect!
Eleanor, great job tonight.
Have you checked the, uh, the ticker?
I could really use some good news.
Okay.
Gah, come on.
Well, the nightmare continues.
The nightmare continues.
How did this not work?
There's no way to increase my point total because everything I'm doing is out of self-preservation.
- I don't understand.
- My motivation is corrupt.
Even when I do nice things, I'm only doing them so I can get something out of it, the ability to stay here, which means none of this had any real moral value.
It doesn't count.
Holy shirt.
I know what I have to do.
Okay, I am almost done with these personalized "I'm sorry" notes to everyone in the neighborhood.
I need you guys to deliver everyone their notes, along with those T-shirts.
Well, granted, these are hilarious, but how is this going to help?
Just trust me.
I'm gonna get the points.
Oh, good morning, Dad.
Where you been?
Oh, just walking around, contemplating my failure, wishing for the sweet release of eternal extinction.
Cool.
Hey, um why don't you want me to see Janet?
I'm a good guy.
All I want is to give Janet the life she deserves.
Janet is not built for human life, and I'm not sure you're much of a provider.
Do you even remember how you died?
No, not really.
It's a little fuzzy.
You and your friend Pillboi were trying to rob a restaurant.
Pillboi!
And then the cops showed up.
So the plan was to pretend to install a safe with your friend hiding inside it.
He pops out, steals the money from the restaurant, gets back in the safe, then you come in and uninstall it.
I refuse to discuss my fifth amendment rights until I concur with your attorney.
Sure.
Look, we found your buddy's plans.
We know he was the brains.
You were just an accomplice.
If you're lucky, you might get probation.
- Jason going to jail?
- No, man.
Jason's dead.
He suffocated in that safe.
There were no air holes.
Plus he did a bunch of whippits while he was in there, which couldn't have helped.
At least he died doing what he loved a bunch of whippits.
Now he's never gonna get the life he truly deserved.
Eh, I think he got roughly what he deserved.
I suffocated to death in in a safe?
I'm a moron.
Hey hey, Janet?
-  - Hi, there.
- Janet, you need to leave me.
- Why?
You're the smartest girl in the world - I'm not a girl.
- And your dad is an angel.
I mean, what a family.
I'm just a dope who died in a safe with a snorkel who's only now realizing why that didn't work.
You should be with someone better.
I don't deserve you.
Jason, you are all that I care about, possibly because I did not have the capacity to care about anything before you.
I love you.
Also, interesting sidenote, I think I might hate things now, too.
So far, it's genocide and leggings as pants.
This is nuts.
Just weighing in over here.
This is bonkers.
Okay, I have to go reboot Janet.
- Why?
- It's the only thing I can think of to do to get rid of this glitch.
Yo, who you calling a glitch?
It means "error," Jason, which is what this is.
Oh, really?
Is it an error to act unpredictably and behave in ways that run counter to how you were programmed to behave?
Yes.
Now, you two sit tight.
I'm gonna go murder Janet, and I'll be right back.
Look on the bright side.
When you're rebooted, I can teach you all the Dorito flavors again.
No.
I'm not starting over.
What if he reboots me, and we fall out of love?
We have to get out of here right now.
Where do you suppose she is?
I hope she's okay.
You know, the more I work on her case, the more I think she truly belongs here.
I'm I'm sorry that I haven't been able to say what you want me to say, because I-I do want to say it.
What's holding you back?
Honestly, my biggest fear is just making sure that my motivation for saying it Chidi?
- Wow.
- How did she suddenly?
Her motivation changed.
She couldn't earn enough points by apologizing to everyone here because she was only doing it to earn enough points to stay here.
But she did earn enough points, which means that she's decided not to stay here, - which means - That she's leaving.
Oh, hey, Janet.
I was just about to call you to ask you to get me a train to the Bad Place.
- Whoa, what?
- You have to be a good person to stay here, and I can't become a good person unless I leave.
You don't belong here, Jason doesn't belong here, and now that I can think and feel, I don't belong here either.
- Where are you going with this?
- There is a woman named Mindy St. Clair who lives in a neutral zone by herself.
It's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.
A Medium Place?
Dude, that's where I belong.
I've been saying that since day one.
It's where Jason and I are going.
Would you like to come with us to Mindy's house?
Yeah.
Let's go hang with Mindy.
That sounds great.
Love her, huge fan.
Call the train.
Look, there it is now.
I did not call that train.
That train belongs to Shawn, the judge, who's coming here to judge you.
Can you make that train go to Mindy's house?
- Yep.
- Then we have to go right now.
I just have to run home real quick and hit save on the Madden game I was playing because Blake Bortles has, like, 300 yards passing in the first half   Shawn.
Ooh.
- Michael.
- Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.
I, uh, had something I needed to tend to, but it can wait, it can wait.
Okay, I've hacked into the mainframe.
-  - Kidding.
I can't hack into the mainframe.
Technically, I am the mainframe.
Would you just hurry up?
I'm here to rule on the fate of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.
Yes, yes, um, I think we have a rock solid case for Fake Eleanor.
I truly believe she's a good person.
-  - Are you sure?
Because I believe she's stealing my train.
I'm sorry, Michael.
Sorry, everyone.
Well not great for my case.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 And now The end is near And so I face The final curtain - Ow!
What the hell?
- Walk it off, Lululemon.
I'll say it clear I'll state my case Of which I'm certain I've lived A life that's full I traveled each and "Live every day like it's your last".
Bite me.
I'ma live forever, bitch.
Ma'am?
It's $132.21.
So, big plans this weekend?
Yep.
I'm gonna sit alone in my house watching wedding fails on YouTube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzlers straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator.
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
No.
Buzz off, whale-humper.
You know, I see you here all the time, and you're always mean to me, and it really hurts my feelings.
It does?
Because the minute you're out of my line of sight, I literally forget you exist.
Watch.
You exist.
You don't exist.
You're bothering me.
Don't care if you die.
- See?
- Why are you like this?
Excuse me?
Why am I like this?
You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
Look what you made me do, jag-off.
- And did it my - Oh, my God, look out!
- Uh-oh.
- Way  Oh, good, you're awake.
Can I ask you a question about where we're going?
Sure.
Where are we going?
I forgot.
We're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.
We're going to a Medium Place.
Hmm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way?
'Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum and some football cards and some scratchy tickets.
- Go away from me.
- Okay.
Can this train go any faster, Janet?
No pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught.
Don't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St. Clair's house.
It'll be our sexy little secret.
Jason taught me about sexy things.
Oh, yeah?
What things did he say were sexy?
Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr. ads, and sex.
Eh, some of those are right.
I'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
What up, ding-dongs?
Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirt bag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirt bag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad.
And she belongs with us.
Oh, also, check this out.
- Nailed it.
-  I've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.
What I will consider is the recent development - of Eleanor stealing my train.
- Now, hold on a second.
She stole your train to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.
She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless -  - No, don't oh!
- What's happening?
- I should have warned you.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.
- Finally.
-  - Oh, come - What did he just say?
Oh, because you're all so perfect.
Wow.
So where does this Mindy St. Clair live?
I don't know.
I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
I don't have any - of my normal abilities here.
- Perfect.
Well, let's try this way.
Ooh, I've never had to walk before.
This is fun.
Now I'm bored.
Walking is dumb.
Well, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl Oh!
She's naked!
-  - Oh, sorry!
-  -  -  -  Who are you?
I'm Janet.
Hello, Mindy.
My name is Beadie.
I'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day - in the afterlife.
- What's up, idiot?
Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant?
- That's not possible.
- Congrats.
Yeah, so, Mindy, look.
You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing.
I mean, I still think we should get you They didn't, but neither did we.
A compromise was made: the neighborhood you are in now by yourself.
You submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.
Yeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.
We got you your favorite beer.
Yeah, but it's always warm.
On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.
Yeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions.
Also, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner.
It's deeply terrible.
You get the idea.
Welcome to eternal mediocrity.
- Welcome to the Medium Place.
- So what's up?
What's your deal?
Are you single?
- What's going on?
-  Sorry about before.
One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.
My kind of gal.
And I gotta say, you keep it tight.
Oh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.
So tell us everything.
I mean, what did you do - to end up here?
- That's kind of a long story.
- Gonna need a drink or three.
- Definitely my kind of gal.
You guys have fun.
This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.
So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.
I only cared about making money and doing cocaine.
One night, I had an epiphany, right?
I needed to do something good with my life.
So I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way.
- You were pretty coked-up, huh?
- Oh, yeah, man, I was flying high.
It was so awesome.
But you're not gonna believe this I followed through.
Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start - that charity.
- Good for you!
And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me  'Cause I love cocaine.
Do you have any?
I'm just I shouldn't Do you?
- No.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I was just I was just kidding.
It was just a joke.
I mean, who would want to do cocaine right now?
- Are you okay?
- Anyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and she used my money to start the Mindy St. Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah.
It's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.
Oh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not?
Exactly.
I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.
Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.
But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know?
Well, it beats being tortured.
I was about to turn myself in.
No.
Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.
This is about survival.
You gotta look out for number one.
Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we Yeah, no, I get it.
It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.
No, thanks.
This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
Later.
What were we talking about?
What is her deal?
Why is she like this?
I don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on.
Is that weird?
- You're my boss.
- Oh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm.
Eleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.
Is that the whole story?
Well, no.
Someone else was sent here by mistake.
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.
- You knew about Jason?
- Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is What's the human expression?
Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.
I will deal with Jason Mendoza later.
For now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in the Good Place.
We can do this, but we must remain emotionless.
I'm talking "Kristen Stewart on a red carpet" level of emotionless here, all right?
Begin.
Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.
I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
Please, I'm begging you, please.
Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
Sorry.
I'm getting choked up.
Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to the Bad Place would be a point in her favor.
However, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in the Bad Place.
We have no idea where she is.
- Well, what the - What?
- Fork!
-  I will now review Eleanor's memories.
Her memories?
As in, all the things - she's done on Earth?
- Mm-hmm.
But perhaps we could take a little break first.
You know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired.
I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.
Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.
Where should we begin, "Waiters Screamed At" or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman from Spin Class"?
Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something?
Uh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine.
I thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.
- No.
- Okay, I get it.
Hey, uh, where did you get that?
That's not one of my books.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
It reminds me of him.
Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
Okay.
Instead of reading, I will watch this VHS copy of "Cannonball Run II".
Or maybe "The Making of 'Cannonball Run II.
'" Wow.
Very medium.
Yeah.
Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet?
No.
We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other.
It was weird.
This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.
It's my 24th birthday!
What!
Hot tiara, girl.
That was "The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's QuinceaÃ±era".
Let's move on to another event.
"Heckling of Mall Santas"?
"Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"?
"Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock"?
Oh, no.
This is getting away from us.
We need to do something quickly.
Yeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally?
Ugh.
Fine.
Dramamine.
Helps with the nausea.
Proceed.
Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.
I was particularly disturbed by "Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt," but that was the old Eleanor.
She changed.
She worked and she studied and she got better.
And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.
I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.
Because she's worth it.
I, too, helped Eleanor.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.
Eleanor deserves to stay.
Thank you for these testimonials.
A ruling has been reached.
Oh, you want to hear it.
I forgot how needy humans are.
Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
She deserves to be in the Bad Place.
- Oh!
- As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest oh, he's from Florida?
Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.
No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling?
You have no idea where they are.
Bad Janet?
-  - What's up, fork nuts?
Engage walkie-talkie protocol.
What if you're here, and I'm like this?
Yes, that may work.
Whoa, what is happening?
Is she having an orgasm?
Did I do it somehow?
Attention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.
This is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.
My name's Shawn.
We do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.
You have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.
Either return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil will go to the Bad Place in your stead.
- What?
- What?
You have four hours.
Good-bye.
Your Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.
They are not completely innocent.
They told me so themselves.
They aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ.
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to the Bad Place?
We're off the hook, this is amazing!
Babe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long.
We don't have to go back, though.
- they just said.
- We can't let Tahani and Chidi go to the Bad Place.
They're our friends.
- We literally owe it to them.
- If they're really our "friends," then why aren't they here with us right "now"?
Because we ran away.
Are you Does your brain work, actually?
Do you have a functioning head?
I think he has a good point.
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.
How can you say that?
Think practically here.
Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.
- But they do.
- That's their problem.
Your problem is whether you get tortured.
Now if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time.
When isn't it?
We're going back.
- But - Now.
Can we even make it there in time?
I believe so, though it'll be close.
- Where's Jason?
- Heads up!
Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.
Bortles!
No!
What are you doing, you goon?
Trying to blow up the train.
Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
Let me try again.
Do do you have another bottle?
Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
- Ah, kind of like a last meal.
- Not like a last meal, just, uh, the final food you might ever eat.
I'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in the Bad Place, being forced to wear a a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.
- That's what you think hell is?
- Ugh.
Janet, please, we have to go.
I won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.
Buddy Come on, we gotta go.
I don't wanna go to the Bad Place.
It's scary, like the movie "Ratatouille".
- What?
- Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.
I'm scared too.
But we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.
We'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out I'd get used to room-temperature beer.
Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.
No, it's time to own up, dude.
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.
Why were you like that?
Well let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.
Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.
Ugh, your mother's coming?
Oh, boy, hide the silverware.
You mean the silverware you stole from Mom?
Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.
I drove here as fast as I could.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets?
There are no tickets, Mom.
I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
Ah-ha!
Burn.
Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay?
We are a family.
Whose birthday is it?
- Mine.
- Are you serious?
No way.
That was a B.S. foul on Chapman.
And since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something.
I just need you to sign it.
Emancipation papers?
Honey!
What does "emancipation" mean?
It means I'll be on my own.
All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys.
I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
So irresponsible.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.
I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.
I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint.
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter?
You're a really interesting person, Eleanor.
We should hang out sometime.
Wow, your parents sucked.
Yeah, they did, and I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
No more.
We know what's right here.
We have to go back.
Ride-or-die.
-  - Time is up.
In preparation for your trip to the Bad Place, please put on these fedoras.
Oh, no.
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.
We surrender.
Together.
Chidi, Tahani, we're back to save your souls.
Real weird vibe in here.
Was definitely expecting some applause.
You're too late.
You you missed the cut-off.
But we're here.
We came here as fast as we could, and we're here.
So now what?
What is the most logical decision?
I made my initial ruling.
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.
The original perpetrators are here.
This is exhausting.
I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
You can decide.
You have 30 minutes.
Uh, don't I get to weigh in?
No.
I am in charge of all matters here for the next 30 minutes.
Bring me a list of the frozen yogurt flavors.
We have some work to do there as well.
Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging?
Oh.
Fine, Dave, just fine.
I put your mail on your desk and you have an appointment later with the Director of Point Calculations.
Ugh.
Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo.
I get to design it myself?
You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
Okay.
Easy there, rookie.
Starting immediately, you'll be out of my department.
You'll be reporting directly to the front office.
This is your shot.
Good luck.
All I ever wanted was for this neighborhood my first neighborhood to be perfect.
Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
This is truly the saddest day of my life.
Okay, I guess I'll speak first.
Jason and I are the mistakes.
We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so we should go to the Bad Place.
- Agreed.
- Yes.
Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.
Hang on.
That judge guy just said everyone here has done bad things.
Let's look at this ethnically.
For what I hope is the last time, it is "ethically".
You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.
It's basic consequentialism: the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences.
Great.
The one time you actually remember something from class.
Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way.
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
He murdered Janet.
He killed my wife!
I was trying to stop you from doing it!
Yeah, but you did it.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.
Okay, well, it's settled then.
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.
For the last time, my name is Jason, not Jianyu, the amazing and incredible monk.
Which is why you belong in the Bad Place.
And by the way, Janet is not your wife, or your soul mate.
There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony.
It was not legal.
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.
What?
But I'm not going.
I don't wanna.
I know you don't "wanna," goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it.
Chidi and Tahani are better people than we are.
We tried to improve ourselves and you know what?
We did a good job.
Well, I did a good job.
You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
-  - I could never do that on Earth.
This place truly is paradise.
- Look at them.
-  Whispering away like two Beefeaters on a tea break.
I bet they're plotting against us.
No way.
Eleanor wouldn't do that.
You do have feelings for her, don't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
But no.
Please don't make me think about this again.
My brain will break.
I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
You must see this.
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.
It's meaningful, don't you think?
This whole romantic situation is such a mess.
I am vexed, Tahani.
Vexed.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened.
I don't have an actual soul mate.
What's gonna happen to me when Jason and Fake Eleanor go and you're off with Real Eleanor?
Whither Tahani?
Okay, team meeting.
Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
- Bye, Tahani.
-  Sorry for everything.
After I'm gone you can go ahead and clean out my bud hole.
Thank you.
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit.
I will not.
It is literally impossible for me to do that.
Well, it's been real, dog.
Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships.
Yeah, that checks out.
I feel like I failed you.
No.
Don't ever think that.
I was dropped into a cave, and you were my flashlight.
Oh.
Good-bye forever.
I will miss you so much.
I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.
All right, ready to go?
Let's grab Michael.
Come in.
Hi, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, I'm going to the Bad Place.
I've taken one of the slots.
- What?
- Awesome.
I've been there, I know I can hack it.
Actually, I have kind of a rapport with some of the fire monsters.
Eleanor, that's crazy.
You belong here.
There's another reason.
Everyone here is supposed to have a soul mate, and my soul mate doesn't love me.
I don't know if you love the other Eleanor or Tahani or someone else, but you don't love me, which means that this will never really be my Good Place.
I'm going, so you only have to choose one more person.
Okay, that means that means that what does that mean?
It means I get to stay here with my wife forever!
We did it, Eleanor!
USA!
USA!
USA!
USA!
USA!
Whoo-hoo!
This is so dope!
I get to stay You realize if you stay, I still have to go, right?
Yes, but I get to stay.
Good point, bud.
Well reasoned.
Wow, Chidi is a terrible writer.
This is a real mess, huh?
No matter what they decide, I'd bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water with your boss.
Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
Retirement?
Course, what do I know?
I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
But face it, this is your mistake.
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.
Which one's which?
I always forget.
Black is regular, orange is anti-matter.
Working on your first solo design, right?
How's it coming?
Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently?
I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.
We never even get to be there to see how fun it is.
Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.
Mm.
French vanilla?
Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it?
A good job.
All right, nerds, let's just get this over with.
I'll go to the Bad Place with Real Eleanor, - and you three can stay.
- Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
Wait, no.
You're not going.
I am.
- What?
- Why?
Real Eleanor is my soul mate or was my soul mate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
- Do you?
- I don't know.
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.
The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.
Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
No, dude, this is bonkers.
I am going.
End of story.
No, I'm going.
End of everything.
What?
Now you're trying to replace Chidi?
No.
I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.
Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
Look, I love you and I think you love me.
We can be together, away from everyone else.
Obviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy.
Okay, you realize the Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right?
If it is, Janet and I would like to go.
I am going!
And Real Eleanor is going!
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor!
No, I'm going with Chidi!
Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.
- Hey, that's racist!
- Not a robot.
Oh, you have some nerve.
-  - Guys?
Guys!
Holy motherforking shirtballs.
What?
Oh, man.
Wow!
Okay, okay.
Uh, whoo!
Yo, Mikey!
Shawn!
Come on out!
Is everything okay?
Right as rain, Mikey my boy.
So, Chidi and I are gonna go to the Bad Place.
- What?
- Trust me, I've got this.
That's our decision.
Let's hit it.
Well, what about Real Eleanor?
No, it's me and Chidi.
Call the train.
Point of order.
I don't accept this offer.
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
Gah, gah, gah, gah!
You said any two of us.
It's me and Chidi.
Let's do it to it.
Michael!
I just found an obscure precedent in the rules that might just save everyone.
Buzz off, Bambadjan!
Don't need it.
Oh, okay.
Ready when you are, boss.
Eleanor, what's going on?
It took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself, "Man, this is torture".
And then it hit me.
They're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.
The can't, because we're already here.
This is the Bad Place.
Oh, man!
I can't believe you figured it out.
Oh, God!
Y-you ruined everything, you know that?
Oh, man.
Eleanor, you really suck!
-  - I was so close to pulling it off!
Sorry.
So she's right?
Yeah, she figured it out.
No, this doesn't make any sense.
This is paradise.
Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.
I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
Just me being here forced Chidi into an ethical "clusterfork".
Tahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured my because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was torture for Chidi, because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soul mate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her.
You don't love me?
Please, don't ask me that right now.
See?
We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.
I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.
He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.
He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.
And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.
He played us like a fiddle.
You gotta give it up.
Oh, dip!
Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.
Oh, yeah.
You did!
Great job, man.
Chidi, don't go!
I don't care if you don't love me, I love you.
It's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, - and I think we should stay - No, stop, Vicky.
They figured it out.
- They - They know this is the Bad Place.
Eleanor figured it out.
Man!
This was supposed to be my big moment.
I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it.
Do you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years?
The time has come to innovate.
The human afterlife can be more fun.
For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.
Who cares about those dummies?
I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.
I'm going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
We've tried this.
Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
What makes you think that you can get them to do this?
Because they won't even know that they are doing it.
I'm going to make them think that they are in the Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect.
What?
I even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.
Ugh!
It can work.
-  - Look, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh.
Let's try something new.
Too many variables.
Too many moving parts.
That's what will make it fun.
I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.
We'll we'll be on our toes.
It'll be exciting.
I think that we can get them to torture each other for 1,000 years.
I think you'll be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.
But take me through it.
How would this work, exactly?
Oh.
Yes, all right, so  This is a 14 million-point plan.
Um oh, sorry.
I thought we reserved the conference room.
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.
Sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
So, Bambadjan and Gunnar and Shawn everyone else in this neighborhood Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us.
After I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to torture you.
How can I be over it?
We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.
Get your story straight.
Okay.
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.
- Tracy, you're his soul mate, Nina a marriage counselor.
Maybe we can get them to swing with us.
That's perfect, perfect!
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey, guys?
It's Michael!
That was really a fun time.
Then it all started to go off the rails.
When I confessed.
You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that, Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
I mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.
You know, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be, teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason.
Hang on.
That part is real.
Oh, yeah.
Janet isn't one of us.
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.
And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.
I mean  What a world, huh?
Wait, I don't get something.
I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani?
Oh, yeah.
Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever?
Uh, $60 billion, actually, so.
Oh.
But it didn't matter because my motivations were corrupt.
I didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.
I just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention.
My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.
Which I did.
Couple of times, actually.
But wait, why is Chidi here?
Well, uh there's something you don't know about me.
I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use - almond milk in my coffee - No, dingus!
You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
Oh, fork!
You're right.
Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.
I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.
I made everyone miserable.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, you were the closest to actually getting in, up there.
You weren't that close.
You were just the closest.
That makes me feel worse, somehow.
Good.
Thank you, Chidi.
I really needed to hear that right now.
I mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing.
This really sucks.
No, it doesn't.
This is wonderful.
You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.
But that's for another time.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.
We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
Oh, Eleanor.
That's it!
My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
- Uh, next time?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again.
Hopefully.
Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
Wish me luck.
Guys, we need a plan.
Quick.
Tahani, anything?
Chidi, I need ya.
You're the smart one.
I-I can't.
I-I can't.
- Jason?
- What?
What's up?
Ugh!
What do you say?
Take two, huh?
I don't know.
I mean, what is this?
All this work for four people, and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe?
I feel like a real weenie.
Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.
Let me let me just tinker a little, try again.
Okay.
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
Guys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing.
Ugh!
You're useless!
What do I write?
What do I write?
Ooh!
Come on, brain.
Janet?
You can't eat anything, right?
- Correct.
- Open up.
All right, let's try again, shall we?
You know what, bro?
Do your worst.
We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael?
Ya bas   Eleanor, come on in.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Cool.
You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends?
That's how you're going to feel every day.
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan, that really put you over the top, you got a ton of points for that.
Eleanor?
I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soul mate.
Cool.
Bring it in, man.
So where are you from, Chris?
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, and I was a mailman.
Really?
Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right?
Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out?
I love working out.
I gotta stay jacked, it's who I am.
Yeah, you gotta.
Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other.
Great.
See ya soon.
-  -  - Hi there.
-  - Who are you?
- I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What?
What the fork is a "Chidi"?
Why can't I say "fork"?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1 And now The end is near And so I face The final curtain - Ow!
What the hell?
- Walk it off, Lululemon.
I'll say it clear I'll state my case Of which I'm certain I've lived A life that's full I traveled each and "Live every day like it's your last".
Bite me.
I'ma live forever, bitch.
Ma'am?
It's $132.21.
So, big plans this weekend?
Yep.
I'm gonna sit alone in my house watching wedding fails on YouTube, drinking margaritas through a Twizzlers straw until I pass out on top of my vibrator.
Hi there.
Do you have a second to talk about the environment?
No.
Buzz off, whale-humper.
You know, I see you here all the time, and you're always mean to me, and it really hurts my feelings.
It does?
Because the minute you're out of my line of sight, I literally forget you exist.
Watch.
You exist.
You don't exist.
You're bothering me.
Don't care if you die.
- See?
- Why are you like this?
Excuse me?
Why am I like this?
You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.
Look what you made me do, jag-off.
- And did it my - Oh, my God, look out!
- Uh-oh.
- Way  Oh, good, you're awake.
Can I ask you a question about where we're going?
Sure.
Where are we going?
I forgot.
We're going somewhere that's not the Good Place, and it's not the Bad Place.
We're going to a Medium Place.
Hmm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way?
'Cause Janet's powers aren't working, and I want some gum and some football cards and some scratchy tickets.
- Go away from me.
- Okay.
Can this train go any faster, Janet?
No pressure, but Jason and I will literally be tortured for all of eternity if we get caught.
Don't worry, there's no way to tell we're going to Mindy St. Clair's house.
It'll be our sexy little secret.
Jason taught me about sexy things.
Oh, yeah?
What things did he say were sexy?
Lamborghinis, cool snakes, spinning rims, 20,000 followers on Instagram, girls with pigtails eating lollipops, latex pants, Carl's Jr. ads, and sex.
Eh, some of those are right.
I'm here to preside over case #00003 regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet to present their argument.
What up, ding-dongs?
Yeah, so basically, um, the Fake Eleanor's a dirt bag, and these jabronis are gonna try and claim she's less of a dirt bag now, but she just stole your train, and she still sucks bad.
And she belongs with us.
Oh, also, check this out.
- Nailed it.
-  I've ruled the fart inadmissible as evidence.
What I will consider is the recent development - of Eleanor stealing my train.
- Now, hold on a second.
She stole your train to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.
She was sacrificing herself because she is a wonderful, selfless -  - No, don't oh!
- What's happening?
- I should have warned you.
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.
If he detects any feelings in your voice, he retreats into a cocoon, so what we need to do now is just be very still and very quiet.
- Finally.
-  - Oh, come - What did he just say?
Oh, because you're all so perfect.
Wow.
So where does this Mindy St. Clair live?
I don't know.
I'm out of range of our neighborhood.
I don't have any - of my normal abilities here.
- Perfect.
Well, let's try this way.
Ooh, I've never had to walk before.
This is fun.
Now I'm bored.
Walking is dumb.
Well, given that she's the only person in the neighborhood, I'm guessing this is the pl Oh!
She's naked!
-  - Oh, sorry!
-  -  -  -  Who are you?
I'm Janet.
Hello, Mindy.
My name is Beadie.
I'm from the Good Place, and welcome to your first day - in the afterlife.
- What's up, idiot?
Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant?
- That's not possible.
- Congrats.
Yeah, so, Mindy, look.
You mostly sucked, but then you did this one good thing.
I mean, I still think we should get you They didn't, but neither did we.
A compromise was made: the neighborhood you are in now by yourself.
You submitted a list of things you wanted; the Good Place provided those things.
Yeah, and the Bad Place made some modifications.
We got you your favorite beer.
Yeah, but it's always warm.
On your jukebox, you'll find every song ever sung.
Yeah, by The Eagles, and it's only the live versions.
Also, there's some spoken word poetry from William Shatner.
It's deeply terrible.
You get the idea.
Welcome to eternal mediocrity.
- Welcome to the Medium Place.
- So what's up?
What's your deal?
Are you single?
- What's going on?
-  Sorry about before.
One of the perks of living alone is that I get to just walk around naked.
My kind of gal.
And I gotta say, you keep it tight.
Oh, that is the nicest and only thing anyone has said to me in 30 years.
So tell us everything.
I mean, what did you do - to end up here?
- That's kind of a long story.
- Gonna need a drink or three.
- Definitely my kind of gal.
You guys have fun.
This is me and Janet's honeymoon, so we're gonna go try and figure out how to have sex.
So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer in the 1980s.
I only cared about making money and doing cocaine.
One night, I had an epiphany, right?
I needed to do something good with my life.
So I drew up plans for this foundation that would help kids all over the world, would advance human rights, revolutionize agriculture, and just improve every nation and every society in every possible way.
- You were pretty coked-up, huh?
- Oh, yeah, man, I was flying high.
It was so awesome.
But you're not gonna believe this I followed through.
Yeah, I woke up the next morning, I went straight to the bank, I withdrew my life savings, and I was gonna start - that charity.
- Good for you!
And then I immediately fell into subway tracks and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh - Honestly, not the type of rail I thought was gonna kill me  'Cause I love cocaine.
Do you have any?
I'm just I shouldn't Do you?
- No.
- Oh, yeah.
I mean, I was just I was just kidding.
It was just a joke.
I mean, who would want to do cocaine right now?
- Are you okay?
- Anyway, so after I died, uh, my sister found my plan, and she used my money to start the Mindy St. Clair Rescue Alliance, yeah.
It's actually the largest relief aid charity in the world.
Oh, so the question was, did you get credit for all those good person points or not?
Exactly.
I don't know how long my case was pending or whatever, but when I woke up, the two sides had been fighting about me for a long time.
Like a stripper over that last bump of coke at the party, if you know what I mean.
But anyway, they finally came to this compromise, you know?
Well, it beats being tortured.
I was about to turn myself in.
No.
Yeah, there's no time for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.
This is about survival.
You gotta look out for number one.
Right, well, we don't have proof that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.
Oh, I know you've only worked here a few weeks, but we have this little office tradition where we all pitch in, and then we Yeah, no, I get it.
It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week, and if I let you give me a cake, that means I gotta pitch in to get Lisa a cake and sing to her and wear one of those dumb hats you all are wearing right now.
No, thanks.
This way, I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything.
Later.
What were we talking about?
What is her deal?
Why is she like this?
I don't know, but the meaner she is, the more it turns me on.
Is that weird?
- You're my boss.
- Oh, say that to me again, but more disgusted with me, like I'm a worm.
Eleanor was supposed to be in the Bad Place, arrived here by accident, assumed another person's identity, and has now escaped.
Is that the whole story?
Well, no.
Someone else was sent here by mistake.
His name is Jason Mendoza, and I believe he's on the train with Eleanor.
- You knew about Jason?
- Yes, I know that he's a fake and that he's married to Janet and that this entire neighborhood is What's the human expression?
Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.
I will deal with Jason Mendoza later.
For now, I will hear your arguments for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop should stay in the Good Place.
We can do this, but we must remain emotionless.
I'm talking "Kristen Stewart on a red carpet" level of emotionless here, all right?
Begin.
Eleanor dedicated herself to the study of ethics.
I was blown away by her capacity for self-improvement.
Eleanor is a magnificent person who has grown tremendously in her time here.
Please, I'm begging you, please.
Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place proves that she is a selfless person.
Sorry.
I'm getting choked up.
Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself and heading to the Bad Place would be a point in her favor.
However, I've just received word that Eleanor is not currently in the Bad Place.
We have no idea where she is.
- Well, what the - What?
- Fork!
-  I will now review Eleanor's memories.
Her memories?
As in, all the things - she's done on Earth?
- Mm-hmm.
But perhaps we could take a little break first.
You know, we've been at it for a while, and you must be tired.
I've been asleep in goo for the last 29 years, so I'm good.
Call up the screen for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.
Where should we begin, "Waiters Screamed At" or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman from Spin Class"?
Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something?
Uh, no, I kind of have my own private time routine.
I thought you'd want company after being here alone for so long.
- No.
- Okay, I get it.
Hey, uh, where did you get that?
That's not one of my books.
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels with water stains, and I've cut words out of most of them to make pornography.
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me when he was teaching me ethics.
It reminds me of him.
Look, if you wanna survive, you have to forget what you left behind.
Take that whole experience, crumple it up, throw it in the garbage can.
Okay.
Instead of reading, I will watch this VHS copy of "Cannonball Run II".
Or maybe "The Making of 'Cannonball Run II.
'" Wow.
Very medium.
Yeah.
Hey, you two lovebirds figure out how to have sex yet?
No.
We tried for two hours, but there was just a lot of, like, bumping into each other.
It was weird.
This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.
It's my 24th birthday!
What!
Hot tiara, girl.
That was "The Crashing and Subsequent Destruction of Vanessa Garcia's QuinceaÃ±era".
Let's move on to another event.
"Heckling of Mall Santas"?
"Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"?
"Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock"?
Oh, no.
This is getting away from us.
We need to do something quickly.
Yeah, uh, Judge, request permission to speak somewhat emotionally?
Ugh.
Fine.
Dramamine.
Helps with the nausea.
Proceed.
Okay, look, I know, obviously, these memories aren't great.
I was particularly disturbed by "Started Fire in Mailbox to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt," but that was the old Eleanor.
She changed.
She worked and she studied and she got better.
And it wasn't just self-preservation, it was real self-improvement.
I made the decision to help Eleanor that first week, and I'm glad I did.
Because she's worth it.
I, too, helped Eleanor.
Not as much as Chidi, surely, but my help was more friendship and sorely needed fashion advice.
Eleanor deserves to stay.
Thank you for these testimonials.
A ruling has been reached.
Oh, you want to hear it.
I forgot how needy humans are.
Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.
The progress she has made does not offset her actions on Earth.
She deserves to be in the Bad Place.
- Oh!
- As concerning Jason Mendoza, I have heard no statements nor seen any evidence to suggest oh, he's from Florida?
Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.
No, but how do you intend to enforce this ruling?
You have no idea where they are.
Bad Janet?
-  - What's up, fork nuts?
Engage walkie-talkie protocol.
What if you're here, and I'm like this?
Yes, that may work.
Whoa, what is happening?
Is she having an orgasm?
Did I do it somehow?
Attention Eleanor Shellstrop and Jason Mendoza.
This is the Almighty Judge on High of All Beings Living and Dead for All Eternity.
My name's Shawn.
We do not know where you are but hope you are receiving this message.
You have been found to be the rightful property of the Bad Place.
Either return to your original neighborhood, or your accomplices Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil will go to the Bad Place in your stead.
- What?
- What?
You have four hours.
Good-bye.
Your Honor, please, Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.
They are not completely innocent.
They told me so themselves.
They aided and abetted two criminals, one of whom was a DJ.
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani to the Bad Place?
We're off the hook, this is amazing!
Babe, we are going to be trying to make love all night long.
We don't have to go back, though.
- they just said.
- We can't let Tahani and Chidi go to the Bad Place.
They're our friends.
- We literally owe it to them.
- If they're really our "friends," then why aren't they here with us right "now"?
Because we ran away.
Are you Does your brain work, actually?
Do you have a functioning head?
I think he has a good point.
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.
How can you say that?
Think practically here.
Okay, you go back, you turn yourself in, you get sent to the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
Or you stay here, you're safe from the Bad Place, and you never see your friends again.
It's the same results, except if you stay here, you don't get tortured.
- But they do.
- That's their problem.
Your problem is whether you get tortured.
Now if you'll excuse me, it's my masturbating time.
When isn't it?
We're going back.
- But - Now.
Can we even make it there in time?
I believe so, though it'll be close.
- Where's Jason?
- Heads up!
Sorry, Eleanor, but I can't let us leave.
Bortles!
No!
What are you doing, you goon?
Trying to blow up the train.
Blowing stuff up got me out of so many jams on Earth.
Let me try again.
Do do you have another bottle?
Hi there, since there's no Janet here to serve you, I brought you two a little treat.
- Ah, kind of like a last meal.
- Not like a last meal, just, uh, the final food you might ever eat.
I'm gonna miss these little perks when I'm down in the Bad Place, being forced to wear a a knock-off handbag and drink tap water.
- That's what you think hell is?
- Ugh.
Janet, please, we have to go.
I won't start the train until my husband says it's okay.
I'm sorry, Eleanor, but I engaged a ride-or-die protocol so I'm loyal to Jason forever.
Buddy Come on, we gotta go.
I don't wanna go to the Bad Place.
It's scary, like the movie "Ratatouille".
- What?
- Yo, I ain't trying to have rats living in my hat and pulling my hair to get me to do stuff.
I'm scared too.
But we can't just abandon our friends and let them take the fall for us.
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.
We'd just go back to Mindy's house, chill out I'd get used to room-temperature beer.
Me and Janet keep trying to solve the problem of how to have sex, which could take years.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear the Janet walkie-talkie message.
No, it's time to own up, dude.
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy, me first, no matter what, and it literally took dying and being around a bunch of good people to realize that I was kind of a nightmare.
Why were you like that?
Well let me tell you about Doug and Donna Shellstrop.
Hey, Dad, just a warning, Mom's gonna be here in a second.
Ugh, your mother's coming?
Oh, boy, hide the silverware.
You mean the silverware you stole from Mom?
Yeah, but she keeps trying to steal it back.
I drove here as fast as I could.
You scored free WrestleMania tickets?
There are no tickets, Mom.
I knew that was the only way I could get you here.
Ah-ha!
Burn.
Eleanor, just because your father and I are divorced does not mean you can disrespect me like this, okay?
We are a family.
Whose birthday is it?
- Mine.
- Are you serious?
No way.
That was a B.S. foul on Chapman.
And since you both forgot, again, which means you definitely didn't get me a present, again, I got myself something.
I just need you to sign it.
Emancipation papers?
Honey!
What does "emancipation" mean?
It means I'll be on my own.
All my life, I've been taking care of myself and you guys.
I work two after-school jobs because you blew half my college fund bailing your boyfriend out of jail.
So irresponsible.
And you blew the other half trying to frame her boyfriend.
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.
I've been on my own for a while now anyway, and after you sign these papers, it'll be official.
I won't owe you anything; you won't owe me anything.
Well, if you want me to sign oh, that's a joint.
Uh, do you have a pen or a lighter?
You're a really interesting person, Eleanor.
We should hang out sometime.
Wow, your parents sucked.
Yeah, they did, and I've been using their crappy parenting as an excuse for my selfish behavior all my life.
No more.
We know what's right here.
We have to go back.
Ride-or-die.
-  - Time is up.
In preparation for your trip to the Bad Place, please put on these fedoras.
Oh, no.
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.
We surrender.
Together.
Chidi, Tahani, we're back to save your souls.
Real weird vibe in here.
Was definitely expecting some applause.
You're too late.
You you missed the cut-off.
But we're here.
We came here as fast as we could, and we're here.
So now what?
What is the most logical decision?
I made my initial ruling.
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.
The original perpetrators are here.
This is exhausting.
I just want to go back to my container of goo and go to sleep.
The Bad Place is owed two people.
In my opinion, which is an objective fact in this case and all cases always and forever, you have all done bad things since you arrived here, therefore I don't care which two of you go.
You can decide.
You have 30 minutes.
Uh, don't I get to weigh in?
No.
I am in charge of all matters here for the next 30 minutes.
Bring me a list of the frozen yogurt flavors.
We have some work to do there as well.
Morning, Mike.
How's it hanging?
Oh.
Fine, Dave, just fine.
I put your mail on your desk and you have an appointment later with the Director of Point Calculations.
Ugh.
Listen, we got the files for the new crop of incoming, and the Big Guy thinks it's time for you to fly solo.
I get to design it myself?
You've been an apprentice long enough.
You're ready.
Oh, Dave, I'm gonna work so hard.
My design is gonna be absolutely perfect.
Okay.
Easy there, rookie.
Starting immediately, you'll be out of my department.
You'll be reporting directly to the front office.
This is your shot.
Good luck.
All I ever wanted was for this neighborhood my first neighborhood to be perfect.
Somehow I blew it and well, you're all suffering, and for that, I'm deeply sorry.
This is truly the saddest day of my life.
Okay, I guess I'll speak first.
Jason and I are the mistakes.
We're the ones who misled everybody and dragged you all into this mess, so we should go to the Bad Place.
- Agreed.
- Yes.
Okay, I thought you were gonna at least pretend to fight me on that, but whatever.
Hang on.
That judge guy just said everyone here has done bad things.
Let's look at this ethnically.
For what I hope is the last time, it is "ethically".
You guys helped me and Eleanor, right, but we're bad, so you helping us was bad.
It's basic consequentialism: the morality of an action is solely judged on its consequences.
Great.
The one time you actually remember something from class.
Maybe I was brought here by mistake, but since we've been here, I just tried to stay out of everyone's way.
Chidi's done worse stuff than me.
He murdered Janet.
He killed my wife!
I was trying to stop you from doing it!
Yeah, but you did it.
He who smelt it murdered Janet.
Okay, well, it's settled then.
Eleanor and Jianyu are leaving.
For the last time, my name is Jason, not Jianyu, the amazing and incredible monk.
Which is why you belong in the Bad Place.
And by the way, Janet is not your wife, or your soul mate.
There's a Janet in every neighborhood.
Well, I'm in love with this Janet.
We did a bunch of amazing, awesome stuff which almost turned out to be sex, and we were married in a legal ceremony.
It was not legal.
Okay, J-bones, you and me, outside.
What?
But I'm not going.
I don't wanna.
I know you don't "wanna," goofball.
I don't wanna either, but let's face it.
Chidi and Tahani are better people than we are.
We tried to improve ourselves and you know what?
We did a good job.
Well, I did a good job.
You mostly fell asleep in class or made fart noises with your hands.
-  - I could never do that on Earth.
This place truly is paradise.
- Look at them.
-  Whispering away like two Beefeaters on a tea break.
I bet they're plotting against us.
No way.
Eleanor wouldn't do that.
You do have feelings for her, don't you?
I don't know.
Yes.
But no.
Please don't make me think about this again.
My brain will break.
I'm sorry, it's just that I have certain feelings for you.
You must see this.
The universe keeps intertwining our fates.
It's meaningful, don't you think?
This whole romantic situation is such a mess.
I am vexed, Tahani.
Vexed.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to contribute to your misery, it's just that I'm frightened.
I don't have an actual soul mate.
What's gonna happen to me when Jason and Fake Eleanor go and you're off with Real Eleanor?
Whither Tahani?
Okay, team meeting.
Jason has agreed that the two of us should go.
- Bye, Tahani.
-  Sorry for everything.
After I'm gone you can go ahead and clean out my bud hole.
Thank you.
I love you so much, baby.
Promise me you'll visit.
I will not.
It is literally impossible for me to do that.
Well, it's been real, dog.
Sorry, that's how I ended most of my serious relationships.
Yeah, that checks out.
I feel like I failed you.
No.
Don't ever think that.
I was dropped into a cave, and you were my flashlight.
Oh.
Good-bye forever.
I will miss you so much.
I'll miss you too, you sexy skyscraper.
All right, ready to go?
Let's grab Michael.
Come in.
Hi, guys.
Sorry to interrupt.
Um, I'm going to the Bad Place.
I've taken one of the slots.
- What?
- Awesome.
I've been there, I know I can hack it.
Actually, I have kind of a rapport with some of the fire monsters.
Eleanor, that's crazy.
You belong here.
There's another reason.
Everyone here is supposed to have a soul mate, and my soul mate doesn't love me.
I don't know if you love the other Eleanor or Tahani or someone else, but you don't love me, which means that this will never really be my Good Place.
I'm going, so you only have to choose one more person.
Okay, that means that means that what does that mean?
It means I get to stay here with my wife forever!
We did it, Eleanor!
USA!
USA!
USA!
USA!
USA!
Whoo-hoo!
This is so dope!
I get to stay You realize if you stay, I still have to go, right?
Yes, but I get to stay.
Good point, bud.
Well reasoned.
Wow, Chidi is a terrible writer.
This is a real mess, huh?
No matter what they decide, I'd bet you're gonna be in pretty hot water with your boss.
Wouldn't be surprised if retirement were on the table.
Retirement?
Course, what do I know?
I'm just The All-Knowing Judge of All Matters in the Afterlife.
But face it, this is your mistake.
- Morning, Mike.
- Morning, Val.
Which one's which?
I always forget.
Black is regular, orange is anti-matter.
Working on your first solo design, right?
How's it coming?
Do you ever get the feeling we could be doing it all differently?
I mean, it's always the same.
We get the names, come up with the design, they arrive, we move on to the next one.
We never even get to be there to see how fun it is.
Yeah, I guess, but don't rock the boat here, pal, just try to do a good job.
Mm.
French vanilla?
Regular anti-matter's fine, why flavor it?
A good job.
All right, nerds, let's just get this over with.
I'll go to the Bad Place with Real Eleanor, - and you three can stay.
- Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
Wait, no.
You're not going.
I am.
- What?
- Why?
Real Eleanor is my soul mate or was my soul mate and she's only going down there because she thinks that I don't love her.
- Do you?
- I don't know.
Please don't ask me that.
My stomach hurts.
The point is, if she's going down there because of me, I'll never be at peace.
Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
No, dude, this is bonkers.
I am going.
End of story.
No, I'm going.
End of everything.
What?
Now you're trying to replace Chidi?
No.
I'm going to replace Real Eleanor.
Chidi and I are going to go together, which means that you and Real Eleanor and Jason can stay.
Yes!
We get to stay, baby!
We did it!
Look, I love you and I think you love me.
We can be together, away from everyone else.
Obviously, we'll be miserable, but I truly believe our love will make us happy.
Okay, you realize the Bad Place is not some sort of couples retreat, right?
If it is, Janet and I would like to go.
I am going!
And Real Eleanor is going!
No, I'm going with Real Eleanor!
No, I'm going with Chidi!
Me and Janet are staying, just FYI.
Oh, that's enough out of you, robot lover.
- Hey, that's racist!
- Not a robot.
Oh, you have some nerve.
-  - Guys?
Guys!
Holy motherforking shirtballs.
What?
Oh, man.
Wow!
Okay, okay.
Uh, whoo!
Yo, Mikey!
Shawn!
Come on out!
Is everything okay?
Right as rain, Mikey my boy.
So, Chidi and I are gonna go to the Bad Place.
- What?
- Trust me, I've got this.
That's our decision.
Let's hit it.
Well, what about Real Eleanor?
No, it's me and Chidi.
Call the train.
Point of order.
I don't accept this offer.
The real mistakes were Jason and Eleanor.
Gah, gah, gah, gah!
You said any two of us.
It's me and Chidi.
Let's do it to it.
Michael!
I just found an obscure precedent in the rules that might just save everyone.
Buzz off, Bambadjan!
Don't need it.
Oh, okay.
Ready when you are, boss.
Eleanor, what's going on?
It took me a while to figure it out, but just now as we were all fighting and yelling at each other and each one of us demanding we should go to the Bad Place, I thought to myself, "Man, this is torture".
And then it hit me.
They're never gonna call a train to take us to the Bad Place.
The can't, because we're already here.
This is the Bad Place.
Oh, man!
I can't believe you figured it out.
Oh, God!
Y-you ruined everything, you know that?
Oh, man.
Eleanor, you really suck!
-  - I was so close to pulling it off!
Sorry.
So she's right?
Yeah, she figured it out.
No, this doesn't make any sense.
This is paradise.
Oh, it looks like paradise, but it's actually a filthy dumpster full of our worst anxieties.
I'm surrounded by people who are literally better than me.
Just me being here forced Chidi into an ethical "clusterfork".
Tahani tortured Jason by constantly trying to get him to talk, Jason tortured my because I was sure he would blow our cover, which was torture for Chidi, because he was responsible for me, which made Chidi seem like the perfect soul mate, and that tortured Tahani because he didn't love her.
You don't love me?
Please, don't ask me that right now.
See?
We've been torturing each other since the moment we arrived, and everything Michael has done has made at least one of us miserable.
I had to be his assistant and try and find myself.
He convinced me to throw my life's work in the garbage.
He made sure I'd see those bogus neighborhood rankings because he knew I'd hate being second-to-last.
And I had the perfect bud hole and no dudes to share it with.
He played us like a fiddle.
You gotta give it up.
Oh, dip!
Eleanor, I told you that first night that we were in a prank show.
Oh, yeah.
You did!
Great job, man.
Chidi, don't go!
I don't care if you don't love me, I love you.
It's the only thing that makes any sense to me in this crazy world, - and I think we should stay - No, stop, Vicky.
They figured it out.
- They - They know this is the Bad Place.
Eleanor figured it out.
Man!
This was supposed to be my big moment.
I just rehearsed that speech for, like, three hours.
Damn it, Eleanor, you are the worst, and you can all suck it.
Do you remember what I told you when you predicted you could do this for 1,000 years?
The time has come to innovate.
The human afterlife can be more fun.
For us, obviously, not for the people we're torturing.
Who cares about those dummies?
I present to you the perfect recipe for my proposed experiment.
Four people, perfectly suited to make each other miserable.
I'm going to design an afterlife where they torture each other.
We've tried this.
Humans are very reticent to torture each other.
Even getting them to do simple things like pulling out each other's teeth is like I can't think of the right analogy.
What makes you think that you can get them to do this?
Because they won't even know that they are doing it.
I'm going to make them think that they are in the Good Place, and to make sure that they drive each other insane, I will be there, posing as a Good Place architect.
What?
I even stole a Good Place Janet we can use.
Ugh!
It can work.
-  - Look, we can just send them all to the hot spike pits with the lava and the bees and the lightning that tears off their flesh.
Let's try something new.
Too many variables.
Too many moving parts.
That's what will make it fun.
I cannot predict everything that's gonna happen, but we'll improvise.
We'll we'll be on our toes.
It'll be exciting.
I think that we can get them to torture each other for 1,000 years.
I think you'll be lucky to get six months out of this insane gambit.
But take me through it.
How would this work, exactly?
Oh.
Yes, all right, so  This is a 14 million-point plan.
Um oh, sorry.
I thought we reserved the conference room.
No, Todd, we have it until 3:00.
Sorry.
Sorry, everyone.
So, Bambadjan and Gunnar and Shawn everyone else in this neighborhood Except for you four, everyone in this neighborhood is one of us.
After I came up with everyone's characters, we'd just create fun scenarios designed to torture you.
How can I be over it?
We haven't discussed it or even spoken for days.
Well, it sounds like you've had a really nice vacation from your full-time job.
Get your story straight.
Okay.
They're at each other's throats already.
This should put them over the top.
Ed, you play Bart, a former private eye.
- Ooh.
- Tracy, you're his soul mate, Nina a marriage counselor.
Maybe we can get them to swing with us.
That's perfect, perfect!
Shh, shh, shh.
Hey, guys?
It's Michael!
That was really a fun time.
Then it all started to go off the rails.
When I confessed.
You had no idea I was gonna do that, because honestly, I had no idea I was gonna do that, Yeah, that came out of nowhere.
I mean, after that it was just a crazy scramble for all of us.
You know, I definitely underestimated how effective Chidi was gonna be, teaching you to be good, and obviously, we didn't anticipate that Janet would fall in love with Jason.
Hang on.
That part is real.
Oh, yeah.
Janet isn't one of us.
No, she's sort of a foundational mainframe for all of the neighborhoods, good and bad.
And apparently, this Janet is in love with Jason.
I mean  What a world, huh?
Wait, I don't get something.
I know why Jason and I were sent here, but why Tahani?
Oh, yeah.
Didn't you raise, like, $1,000 for charity, or whatever?
Uh, $60 billion, actually, so.
Oh.
But it didn't matter because my motivations were corrupt.
I didn't care about helping the people I raised the money for.
I just wanted to prove my parents wrong, stick it to my sister, get fame and attention.
My only real goal was to snog Ryan Gosling at the Met Ball.
Which I did.
Couple of times, actually.
But wait, why is Chidi here?
Well, uh there's something you don't know about me.
I read an article saying that growing almonds was bad for the environment, and yet I continued to use - almond milk in my coffee - No, dingus!
You hurt everyone in your life with your rigidity and your indecisiveness.
Oh, fork!
You're right.
Every friend, every girlfriend was driven nuts because I couldn't do anything.
I missed my mom's back surgery because I had already promised my landlord's nephew that I would help him figure out his new phone.
I made everyone miserable.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, you were the closest to actually getting in, up there.
You weren't that close.
You were just the closest.
That makes me feel worse, somehow.
Good.
Thank you, Chidi.
I really needed to hear that right now.
I mean, all this hard work, all the planning, all for nothing.
This really sucks.
No, it doesn't.
This is wonderful.
You saw us all on Earth a selfish ass, an idiot DJ, a tortured academic, a hot, rich fraud with legs for days Side note, I might legit be into Tahani.
But that's for another time.
You thought we would torture each other, and we did for a little, but we also took care of each other.
We improved each other, and the four of us became a team.
So, the only thing you succeeded in doing was bringing us all together.
Oh, Eleanor.
That's it!
My big mistake was bringing you all together, having you be soul mates living next to each other.
Next time, I'll spread you out so it's more of a slow burn.
- Uh, next time?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna erase your memories, you know, make a few changes and start over again.
Hopefully.
Just gotta get the boss man to sign off.
Wish me luck.
Guys, we need a plan.
Quick.
Tahani, anything?
Chidi, I need ya.
You're the smart one.
I-I can't.
I-I can't.
- Jason?
- What?
What's up?
Ugh!
What do you say?
Take two, huh?
I don't know.
I mean, what is this?
All this work for four people, and me, I'm wearing a judge's robe?
I feel like a real weenie.
Look, for a first attempt it was actually very promising.
Let me let me just tinker a little, try again.
Okay.
But you're way out on a limb here, Mike.
If this thing goes sideways again, you are done.
Guys, he is going to erase our memories at any second and all of this will have been for nothing.
Ugh!
You're useless!
What do I write?
What do I write?
Ooh!
Come on, brain.
Janet?
You can't eat anything, right?
- Correct.
- Open up.
All right, let's try again, shall we?
You know what, bro?
Do your worst.
We figured it out once, we can do it again, because you know what, Michael?
Ya bas   Eleanor, come on in.
You, Eleanor Shellstrop, are dead.
Cool.
You know the way you feel when you see a chimpanzee and a baby tiger who've become friends?
That's how you're going to feel every day.
Your medical relief mission to Kazakhstan, that really put you over the top, you got a ton of points for that.
Eleanor?
I'm Chris Baker.
I'm your soul mate.
Cool.
Bring it in, man.
So where are you from, Chris?
I'm from Teaneck, New Jersey, and I was a mailman.
Really?
Chris, you'll stand by me no matter what, right?
Hold that thought.
Is it okay if I go work out?
I love working out.
I gotta stay jacked, it's who I am.
Yeah, you gotta.
Once I'm back, we'll get to know each other.
Great.
See ya soon.
-  -  - Hi there.
-  - Who are you?
- I'm Janet.
I think this is yours.
After I was rebooted, I found it in my mouth.
What?
What the fork is a "Chidi"?
Why can't I say "fork"?
