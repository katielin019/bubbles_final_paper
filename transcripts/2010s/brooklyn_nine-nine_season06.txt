{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 I've just received the email about whether I've gotten the job as commissioner.
Well, from the look on my face, I'm sure you can guess what it says.
No.
We have no idea at all.
Just tell us, you monster.
Really?
No one noticed the slight tension in my labial commissure?
- My lips.
I'm smiling.
- Wait, you're smiling?
Wait, we're allowed to say "labia" again?
- Wait, you got it?
- I got it.
Ohh!
- Labia.
- Commissioner Raymond Holt.
- Labia.
- You gotta stop right now, Hitchcock.
We need to celebrate.
Ooh, we need music.
Ooh-ohh, ohh, I brought a "Jock Jams" CD for the wedding.
- Oh, we didn't talk about that.
- It was gonna be a surprise.
Our first dance was gonna be the "Tootsee Roll".
Oh, no, and we didn't get to do it.
I know.
All right, nobody move.
I'm gonna go get the CD.
I want to thank you all.
What an incredible moment.
30 years of struggle and sacrifice.
But it was worth it, because I finally get to read the ten words I've longed to hear: "Raymond Holt, you are not the" oops.
I misread the email.
Didn't see the "not".
So I will not be the new commissioner.
Y'all ready for this Jock jam.
Whoo Why is on one else dancing?
Did I miss something?
Feels like I missed something.
I'll just keep going until someone tells me to -  Stop, Jake.
- All right.
So Captain Holt is taking another personal day.
In his absence, I will be running things around here.
That's not true.
I'm in charge.
Mm, no, it's gonna be more of a Westeros free-for-all, okay?
Who will bend a knee?
- I will.
- Nobody's bending anything.
Let's get started.
Sarge, is Captain Holt all right?
He never miss work.
He said he was at a 49 and improving at 8.6% a day.
So I guess he'll be in soon.
Now, we have two Guess who just got paid, y'all.
That's right.
We got stacks on stacks on stacks.
Whoa.
Where's all that cash from?
Well, my brilliant wife found a crazy loophole called "wedding insurance".
It's very common.
It's like renter's insurance.
Oh, my God.
Do we have that too?
- Yes.
- You are a wizard.
The point is, we are getting refunded in full, so we are going on a super-deluxe, five-star mega-baller honeymoon.
So you're not just going to the Berkshires anymore?
Screw that crap hole.
It's a dump, and anyone who goes there is garbage.
I was gonna take Sharon there for a romantic weekend.
Oh, well, congratulations, ya poor.
I am so sorry.
Money really changes you.
The resort is called Posadita Bonita.
And it's in Mexico.
Great food, great beaches, and when I saw "Ay caramba" there, I'll fit right in.
I don't think so.
Isn't that the place that Gina is always talking about, because she gets referral rewards points?
Why, yes, it is.
Don't forget to use code GINA30 at checkout.
It's super intimate and super fancy.
And when we're there, there's only one rule.
A.B.C. Always be coconuting.
At all times, we will either be drinking from, eating, or wearing a coconut.
Oh, this place is amazing.
I've never had sex outside the United States.
What are you thinking about?
Weirdly, the same thing.
- Whoa.
- Welcome to paradise.
- Margarita?
- Yes, I would love one.
But is there any way you could put it in a coconut?
It will be my pleasure, sir.
Oh, thank you.
I requested a ridiculous thing, and he's doing it.
Quick, think of more stupid stuff we can ask for.
Grapes.
Sorry, I panicked.
And I couldn't think of anything.
No, no, no, grapes is perfect.
Excuse me, sir, is there any way you could get my wife some grapes?
- Yes, sir, right away.
- He's running.
He's running for the grapes.
Here are your drinks and a lovers' toolbox from a Mr. Boyle.
Ah, thank you so much.
We will never open this.
Oh, my God, Jake, look.
Yes, the grapes.
Oh, and you brought cheese.
I don't even want cheese.
No, Jake, in the lounge.
Captain Holt?
Peralta?
Ay caramba.
Gina, what the hell?
New phone, who dis?
You can't do that in person.
It's Charles.
Boyle.
Your coworker.
Oh, hey, Charles.
I just found out that your mom left my dad.
They're getting divorced.
Eh, they had a good run.
Fun fact: The average American marriage lasts fewer than two days.
- That's not true.
- It doesn't have to be.
It's commentary.
Well, you know who didn't think it was a good run?
My daddy, Lynn Boyle.
He's inconsolable.
Well, I'm sure he'll get over it.
No, Boyles don't "get over it".
It becomes part of us.
It lives within us.
It eats us out.
We have to get them back together.
- Pass.
- Well, I'm doing it with - or without your help.
- Okay, without.
Okay, you called my bluff.
It has to be with your help.
And I'm not taking no for an answer.
- No.
- Okay, you did it again.
Why are you like this?
I don't know.
Hey, Sarge, I have a problem, and I would ask Holt, - but since he's not back - You came to Top Dog Terry.
Smart move.
I've been solving problems all day long.
Okay, so you know that meth case I've been working on for the last two months?
The Department of Sanitation police want to poach it from me, because the drugs were found in a dumpster.
They're saying it's garbage-related.
This is an easy one.
Tell them to screw off.
See?
Problem solved.
Yeah, well, I did that, and they threatened to make a formal complaint to the mayor.
Then just let them have the case.
Problem solved.
Terry, I've been working on it for two months, and those dummies are gonna blow it.
Right.
Well, you could partner up with sanitation.
Problem solved?
Woof-woof?
Nope.
Headquarters won't allow it due to budgetary reasons.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
You know, Captain Holt was writing an instruction manual for his replacement in case he was named commissioner.
Maybe he could tell you what to do.
That's not necessary.
Top Dog Terry can make a decision.
And what would that be?
Does Top Dog Terry want a moment to think about it?
Woof-woof.
Since the rejection, a great sadness has enveloped me.
I kept expecting this dark feeling to pass, but it's only gotten worse.
Not getting the job you want stinks.
In first grade, I was passed over for line leader, and I'm still pissed.
Kyle D.'s lines had curves and gaps and cutting galore.
It was a frickin' carnival.
Yeah.
What's a line leader?
Well, it's not just that I didn't get the job.
It's that John Kelly did.
He's already released a memo detailing his "vigilant policing" initiative.
It's essentially a return to stop and frisk.
Choosing him is a betrayal of everything I stand for.
I feel the same way about Kyle D. I tried to suck it up and go back to work.
I put on my uniform and got in my car.
And next thing I knew, I was on a plane to Mexico.
I didn't even pack a bag.
I bought a bundle of novelty shirts at a nearby gift shop.
This one says, "What's up, beaches"?
Instead of "bitches" for humor reasons.
- But you hate humor.
- Well, I'm a joke now, so it suits me.
Mm-kay.
But, how did you end up here in Mexico at the exact same tiny resort as us?
Gina's been talking up this place up for years.
Referral Code GINA30.
I had no idea you'd be here.
You know what?
It's fine, sir.
A lot of people go on their honeymoon with their boss.
Nope, I thought if I said it out loud it would normalize it, but it's weird.
It's gonna be okay.
How long are you staying, sir?
Just until I get my head right.
But don't worry.
I'll steer clear of you two.
You won't even know I'm here.
This place is so romantic.
Yeah, and so intimate.
Don't worry.
I'm not listening to you.
I'm just thinking about how this sea bass is cold but not as cold and cruel as the hands of fate that have thrust my entire life into darkness.
Ah, damn it.
I just ordered the sea bass.
Ahh, babe, this is so nice.
There are hot stones on our butts for no reason.
Not on mine.
My butt stones keep falling off, because I'm so tense about Holt being here and ruining everything.
- It hasn't been that bad.
- Really?
Oops.
Sorry.
Can't even float right.
Just push me away.
Everyone else does.
It's not great, but as long as we stay in here, we're safe.
Peralta, Santiago I'm in your room.
What?
How?
Patio door was open I pushed through the hedge.
Tell me, what is it about me that screams loser?
Yeah, you know, we're kind of in the middle of gettin' massages right now, sir.
Oh, how thoughtless of me.
I'll get down here so you can see my face.
Oh, no, that's Hello.
The question was, what is it about me that screams loser?
I can't figure out what went wrong between our parents.
They were so in love.
Oh, okay, so we're having a conversation?
No, to get them back together, we need to know what happened.
Did your mom tell you?
- Nope.
- Damn it.
Okay, let's brainstorm.
It could be that my dad is too clingy or too masculine.
You know what?
I'm going to play a game on my phone while you go on this little journey.
He overshares, he's indecisive, he's always crying.
Oh, I made it inside the temple.
He wears a kimono a lot.
I became a hawk.
I have talons.
Well, he can't keep a secret.
He has a clinically loose pelvis.
Okay, that did break through.
I heard "loose pelvis".
Charles, you've got to stop.
It's none of those things.
Wait.
You said your mom didn't tell you anything.
- Do you know what happened?
- Yes, I do.
And it's none of your business, Charles.
Just stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.
Really, Gina.
And where does my nose belong if not inside our parents?
Okay, so we can get away from Holt.
I mean, should we tell him to leave, that he's ruining our honeymoon?
No, we can't.
That would crush him, and he's already so crushed.
Wait, I got it.
We kill Holt.
No.
No, that was crazy for a multitude of reasons.
We have a bunch of fun activities planned.
If we include him, it'll cheer him up, and he'll leave.
Right, but aren't most of our activities kind of geared towards couples?
Name one couples' activity that wouldn't be more fun with your boss there.
Welcome to Sensual Food Tasting: The Art of Feeding Your Lover.
I feel like I don't belong here.
Mm, I love how the mud revitalizes your skin.
And I love how it masks my shame.
I am loving this.
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Mmm.
This is actually quite pleasant.
You know, when you invited me to join you today, I was skeptical.
I had been sitting by the pool contentedly watching a bee struggle to avoid drowning and thinking to myself how I am like that bee.
Man, I hope it survived.
We can't afford to lose any more bees.
It didn't.
The point is that I am glad you invited me into your frivolous activities.
You helped me to remember there's more to life than the NYPD.
Wow, that's great to hear, sir.
I feel a lot better.
I think I may be heading home.
Unless you need a third for tonight's activities.
- What are we - Sensual pottery.
I think we're good.
Sarge, I keep getting calls about my drug case from What the hell is going on?
Nothing.
Just deciding what to do about your sanitation issue, like a boss.
You're looking for Captain Holt's manual aren't you?
Please, Diaz.
Top Dog Terry does not need to look for Captain Holt's manual.
He knows it's on his computer.
Top Dog Terry was looking for the password.
Why don't you just make your own decision?
I did that, and I'm very proud of it.
I just want to make sure Captain Holt would make the same decision so I can be proud of him too.
Gina.
Do you know Captain Holt's password?
Oh, Terry, just because I know all your passwords doesn't mean I know Captain Holt's.
Okay, well, we could probably guess it.
Why don't you try BaldByChoice or PecMan or MacklemoreEnthusiast?
Stop saying my passwords.
Damn, Gina.
Now Terry's got to update his keychain.
Start simple.
Kevin with a capital K and a 1 instead of an I. Oh, I feel good about that.
Locked out?
Too many failed attempts?
I only guessed once.
Computer will now delete hard drive?
I've got to fix this.
Good.
You fixed it.
He's leaving.
Our plan worked.
We saved our own honeymoon, and fun bonus, - we cheered up Holt.
- Yes.
Okay, it's time to celebrate.
You know what that means.
This B needs a C in her A. Oh, my God.
This babe needs a coconut in her arms.
Oh, I thought you were saying this  needs a  in her .
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, that was my reaction.
All right, I'll go get us a couple of coconuts.
Ahh, hey there, Captain.
Haven't seen you looking this happy since they picked up "The Durrells in Corfu" for a fourth season.
Yes, well, I've reached the best part of every vacation: reviewing the charges.
Well, don't let me interrupt.
Have a safe flight.
And I'll see you back at the Nine-Nine.
No, you won't; I'll never be going back there again.
What?
Why?
I'm confused.
You and Amy made me see that there's more to life than the NYPD, so I'm quitting.
Oh.
Well what a satisfying result that we all were hoping would occur.
Hold on.
So let's just back up a second.
When you say you're quitting, you mean quitting for, like, a couple of weeks, and then you'll come back Jordan-style with a new badge number?
No, I mean, quitting permanently, I'm putting in my resignation as soon as I get back home.
I better hurry if I want to be at the airport six hours ahead of my flight.
Hey, you know what?
I should drive you there.
Will you come with me to grab my keys from the room?
Okay, they're just right in here, so You're not leaving this room.
- What the hell is going on?
- I can't let you quit.
Yes, but why the candles and rose petals?
- Wuh-oh.
- Is that Mr. McClane I hear?
'Cause someone's about to Die Harrr oh, my God.
Why is Captain Holt here?
Because he's gonna wait, are you dressed like Bonnie Bedelia in "Die Hard"?
- I am.
- For sexy reasons?
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.
Jake, why is he here?
Because he's quitting the force, so I brought him to convince him not to, but obviously that is not important anymore.
All right, Captain, it's been a good run.
Thank you for teaching me the importance of a tie in the workplace, and the door is right over here.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
What?
You're quitting?
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
We're keeping you right here.
How are you going to do that?
Physically restrain me?
Great idea.
Is there anything in Charles's box of nightmares that could be used to tie up Holt?
Yes.
Literally everything in here could be used to tie up a person.
Wow, Terry, put Captain Holt's computer back together?
- Looks great.
- Sure did.
Couldn't find room inside for this stuff, though.
Well, is there any chance the info on in computer was maybe saved to the cloud?
I don't know.
Gina, was Captain Holt's hard drive backed up to the cloud?
- Yeah.
- Then why did you let me try to rebuild his computer?
Because I'm a rascal.
Okay, so I just log onto the cloud as Captain Holt and click "forgot password" and answer his security questions.
First up: What is God?
Hey, Gina.
Did you see "Real Housewives" last night?
If she says no, then ask about "Below Deck".
What are you doing?
She's getting suspicious, Scully.
Act natural.
Are you wearing an earpiece?
Tell her no.
Scully, stop saying what I'm saying.
Be normal.
Charles, what are you doing?
Damn it, Gina.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm trying to unlock your phone using a mask of your face so I can find out why your mom left my dad.
Charles, give me my phone.
Okay, fine.
- Boom, unlocked it.
- Give me my phone, Charles.
Not until I find out or parents are breaking up.
- Give it.
- Scrolling, scrolling.
- Give me my phone, you idiot.
- You were the reason.
You sent her a text that says, "You should divorce him"?
Okay, yeah, but that's open to interpretation.
No, but then she says, "I don't want to," and then you say, "But you have to.
"Leave him now, and divorce him.
Don't tell him why".
Okay, yeah, you did interpret it correctly.
Shame, shame.
I'm so sorry I brought Holt back here.
I had no idea you were doing this whole "Die Hard" thing.
Man, you really got the hair exactly right.
Did you contact the onset hair stylist, Paul Abascal?
No, this is a wig.
Oh, that's cool too.
So here's what I'm thinking.
We let Holt go, I have sex with Holly Gennaro but hotter.
The squad handles the captain, or disbands, whatever, we have sex again Okay, stop suggesting that.
We need to stay focused.
- Right.
- Holt it fragile.
We need to be gentle, okay?
- Just follow my lead.
- With pleasure.
I love the view.
I'm sorry.
This outfit is driving me insane.
Hello, sir.
Sorry again for tying you spread eagle - on the bed.
- Apology not accepted.
Look, I know you're upset, but this isn't your last chance to become commissioner.
John Kelly's old.
He's not gonna be in office forever.
True, but he'll just be replaced by another mediocre old white man.
Nothing will ever change.
All right, well, what about all your goals for the Nine-Nine?
You still have so much left to accomplish.
Wrong, I've accomplished everything that I set out to do..
I wanted to reduce crime, and I did.
There's no crime in Brooklyn anymore.
Seems like a bit of a stretch.
What about improving community relations?
Done.
Everyone loves the police.
It's embarrassing.
Way off.
All right, Ame, step aside; I got this.
Captain, what about the Halloween Heist?
I'll just come in and win it and then go back to my house.
- Damn it.
I'm out.
- Jake.
All right, fine, sir, do you know why I love coming to work?
Because there's a bumper pool table in the break room.
Yes, obviously I love the bumper pool table.
But do you want to know another reason why?
You.
You've made me a better cop.
You've made me a better person.
I've learned so much from you.
So you can't quit.
Because I need you.
- Oh, please.
How selfish.
- What?
That little speech you just gave.
It was all about you and what you need.
How unbelievably selfish.
Okay, well, I don't want to get mad right now, 'cause Amy's worried about you, so No, screw that noise.
How dare you call Jake selfish?
He just wasted his entire honeymoon trying to take care of you while you wallowed in your misery like a little baby.
- That seems a little harsh.
- Oh, does it?
- I don't give a hoot.
- Oh, damn.
For the last five years, all I've done is give a hoot about you and what you think.
I gave a hoot about you as a boss.
I gave a hoot about you as a mentor.
I gave a hoot about you as a friend.
She gave so many hoots.
Not anymore.
After the way you've acted and what you just said to Jake, I don't give a hoot, what you think, and I really don't give a hoot if you decide to quit the NYPD, so do it.
I'm all out of hoots.
I'm hootless.
- Now, what I want to say is - Jake.
Coming Holly Gennaro.
Hey, I thought piÃ±a coladas might be too festive, so I got two super-depressing coconuts filled with Merlot.
I'm not depressed.
I'm relieved.
For the first time all week, it's just the two of us.
I'm right here.
I escaped using some of the lube Boyle sent you.
It got everywhere.
I had to change.
Yeah, and your new shirt is very aggressive and confusing.
Is the pineapple the slut, or is it calling someone else a slut?
Clearly the pineapple is the slut.
- Huh.
- Look, I wanted to say I'm sorry.
Yeah?
Maybe find someone who gives a hoot.
Try an owl cage.
Oh, honey, I love you, but not your best.
Look, you have every right not to accept my apology, but at least hear it first.
I'm sorry I said Jake was selfish.
I'm sorry I ruined your honeymoon.
I'm sorry I interrupted your "Die Hard"-themed sexcapades.
You don't have to list everything; it's cool.
Right.
I thought if I played by the NYPD's rules and didn't make any waves, one day I would rise to a position where I could make meaningful change.
When they hired John Kelly, I realized I was wrong, and I thought I was out of options.
But then you tied me to your bed, legs akimbo, and made me realize there was another way.
I could not give a hoot.
Wow, the hoot thing is catching on.
Didn't see that coming.
I'm going to go directly to the mayor and tell him John Kelly's "vigilant policing" proposal is regressive and counter-productive, and if he implements it, I'm gonna make a big stink in the press.
Going over the commissioner and threatening the mayor, sir?
Don't you think that'll piss him off?
I don't give a hoot.
Listen, I'm on the next plane back, but I wanted to pay for you two to extend your stay so you can have a proper honeymoon.
Oh, sir, thank you.
That's very nice, right, Jake?
Yeah, super cool.
Just out of curiosity asking for a friend, where did you get the shirt, and how much did it cost?
Ooh, you're still wearing the mask?
Yeah, to hide my sadness.
I'll take it off.
No, don't.
For some reason, it's easier to care about what you say when you look like me.
Why did you tell your mom to leave my dad, Gina?
Is it so bad being a Boyle?
Yes, it's terrible, but that's not why I did it.
My mom was cheating on your dad, so I told her she had to break it off.
What?
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I didn't want to hurt you or him.
She was being disgusting, so I told her she had to end it.
You were trying to protect us.
Gina, you were actually being sweet.
Uh-doi.
- How's it going, Sarge?
- Not good.
I'm reading this book on religion, and apparently there's some debate as to what God is.
Don't worry about it.
- Gina had the manual.
- What?
Why didn't she just give it to me?
'Cause she's a rascal.
Look at what it says.
"Never use italics, lest people think you are a con-man or a clown".
I'm not sure how this applies here.
No.
Under that.
"If you are unsure of what to do in any situation, consult Sergeant Jeffords".
I trust him completely".
Well, that's a kick in the butt.
So what should I do, Sarge?
Tell sanitation you'll work the case together.
You're the primary, and HQ can take it out of the supplemental budget.
- I'll find the room.
- Cool.
Top Dog Terry's back.
Okay, you ready?
Mm-hmm.
-  - Hello.
Oh, my God.
Are you Melvil Dewey?
Indeed I am.
I invented the Dewey decimal system, but right now I'm working on the Do-me decimal system.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
This is really working for me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Awesome.
- So, Mr. Dewey, can you save me from the terrorists that have taken over Nakatomi Plaza?
Yes, Holly Gennaro, I just need to file them in the library card catalog.
Yeah, this is really hard to track.
Let's just take our clothes off.
Oh, thank God.
This old jacket is so hot.
Yeah.
- - That was magical.
- I can't believe we're back.
- I refuse to accept it.
I'm still coconuting.
This is filled with coffee.
It is very hot.
Coconut is not a good insulator.
No, it's not.
- Captain.
- Peralta, Santiago, how was the end of the honeymoon?
It was amazing.
Not to brag, but I saw a sea turtle.
Kind of sounds like you're bragging, babe.
I was.
It looked right at me.
How'd it go here?
Did you contact the mayor?
Yes.
I voiced my concerns as soon as I got back.
He heard me out, and he's put John Kelly's "vigilant policing" initiative under review.
Way to go, No Hoots Holt.
- Was Kelly pissed?
- Very much so.
To retaliate, he closed the bottom floor of the Nine-Nine for renovations indefinitely.
Everyone's been moved to our bullpen.
- Wait.
What?
-  Prepare yourselves.
The Nine-Nine is at war with the NYPD.
Ay caramba.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1  So, two keys, huh?
That's a lot of snow.
And if you can't handle it, we're happy to find someone who can.
Don't worry about me, friend.
I can handle it.
Marissa, baby, go get our guests something to drink, would you?
- We don't want a drink.
- What is this, a social call?
- It's not a tea party.
- We look like - five-year-old girls to you?
- Gentlemen, please.
Have some patience.
Two keys.
Pure as a Catholic schoolgirl.
Did you bring the cash?
Oh, we brought something much better than cash.
- What is that?
- Our guns!
NYPD!
You're under arrest!
Boss man's gone.
Where'd he go?
Thank you kindly, little lady.
Gio Costa, you're under arrest.
You want that drink now, Hitchcock?
Don't mind if I do, Scully.
Don't mind if I do.
What the hell, Diaz?
You trying to make your heart explode?
I'm loading up on coffee because it's a pain in the ass getting to the kitchen now, and I don't want to come back here.
Is this about the desks?
Yes, Terry, it's about the desks.
How long is Commissioner Kelly going to punish us because Captain Holt complained about him to the mayor?
I don't know, but I hope it ends soon.
Terry's shoulders weren't built for tight spaces.
It's bonk city in here!
I've said "excuse me" more times this morning than I have in my entire life.
Twice!
- Jake.
- Rosa.
Good morning.
Oh, my.
We are very close together.
I love it.
Hey, you know how I've always wanted to have another child?
Well, it's happening!
Genevieve is pregnant?
But I thought your "meh-err" no longer made "whoo-oo".
Correct.
My testes no longer make sperm.
I was good with "meh-err" and "whoo-oo".
No, we're thinking of adopting again.
We just got an email from Nikolaj's 15-year-old brother in Latvia that he's never met.
Yeah, his name is Dragomir.
Oh, my God.
That is a 42-year-old fur trapper.
What?
You don't see the resemblance?
Yeah, to Matisyahu.
There's no way he's 15.
Well, then, how come he wrote that his greatest fear is "going through puberty"?
Probably because he wants you to think he's 15 so you'll adopt him.
Look, Charles, I hate to say this, but I think this guy is scamming you.
Come on.
You're just suspicious - of everyone.
- Jake!
Charles!
Captain wants to see you!
I cannot get through this room anymore, so I'm yelling everything now.
Nancy, Captain said you can go to your psychologist this morning.
You're clear!
Get your head right.
Gentlemen, we have a situation.
Scully and Hitchcock just got a call from Internal Affairs.
They're interested in a case of theirs from 1986.
If you ask me, this old case is only coming up now because the commissioner is trying to drum up a scandal in the Nine-Nine.
And take out your two best detectives in the process.
You're not my two best detectives.
Oh, that's such a relief.
I feel so much safer now.
- Good lord.
- Don't interfere with IA's investigation.
Just find out what actually happened in case Kelly is trying to manipulate the facts.
Can you do that?
Oh, so you're asking if we can open a portal to the wet and wild 1980s to investigation the bizarre lives of these magnificent dodos?
I believe it was a young Barack Obama who said "Uh, yes, we can".
Ooh, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
You want to see me, sarge?
Yeah.
I know we're all sort of crammed together in here, but we were kind of thinking that your uniformed officers are, uh, causing some problems.
Oh?
Like what?
- - How do I put this tactfully?
Your squad turned the kitchen into a cesspool, nastied up the bathroom, and made the elevator smell like a hundred butts.
Okay, thank you for your tact, Diaz.
Well, that's unfair.
Your squad is responsible for at least 50 of those butts.
Look, all I'm saying is maybe you can ask the downstairs people - to be more - Excuse me?
"Downstairs people"?
That's a little offensive.
Oh, don't get it twisted.
It's just where you came from.
Some of my best friends are downstairs people.
Okay, I think you know exactly what that sounds like, you upstairs people.
Oh, thank you for that nice compliment.
It wasn't a compliment, and you know it!
I said it with 'tude.
Classic downstairs person.
Wow, you are prejudiced against the first floor.
I'm taking this up the chain.
Gina Linetti spaghetti confetti.
Gina Linetti spaghetti confetti.
- Faster.
- GinaLinettispaghetticonfetti.
- Captain Holt.
- Uh, yeah, can't you see we're in the middle of something?
Sorry.
It sounded like you were just saying gibberish back and forth.
Gina is helping me to prepare for a televised interview.
Since the mayor has yet to weigh in on Commissioner Kelly's "Vigilant Policing" initiative, I've decided to take my objections straight to the people.
And this gibberish is actually Gina jargon, a world-renowned linguistic system that worked pretty well for Ellen Musk.
- Elon Musk.
- Ellen Musk.
Season one winner of VH1's "Queen Bitch".
Sir, isn't going to the press going to make Kelly even angrier at us?
Yeah.
He's already made life here pretty miserable.
The crowding, the desks, the downstairs people treating the bullpen like a dumpster.
Ooh, I'm so sorry for the untidiness, milord.
That's enough.
I don't have time for your internecine battles, and I don't give a hoot about your minor inconveniences.
I am trying to fight injustice and do what is right for the entire NYPD.
Understood?
Yes, milord.
Okay, let's set the scene.
The year is 1986.
"Top Gun" is crushing the box office, and the Beastie Boys have just been issued - their "License to Ill".
- And that's the year I got felt up for the first time - under the shirt.
- Always a big moment in a young boy's life.
All right, tell us about the case.
We were working organized crime, and we took down a mafia boss, Gio Costa, for running cocaine.
We were the studs of the Nine-Nine.
Well I'm sure "studs" is a bit of a Oh, my God.
I can't believe I'ma say this, but Meow.
No, that is not what I was gonna say, but honestly, yeah, meow.
No offense, guys, but what the hell happened to you?
Are you body shaming us?
No, I'm personality-shaming you.
You were so alert and cool and job-doing.
So how did you get to Costa?
We had a CI on the inside who helped set up a sting.
We took down Costa, recovered a ton of coke and three duffel bags full of cash.
Seems pretty clear-cut, but then why would IA reopen the case?
Unless they think it's some sort of "Freaky Friday" situation and you guys traded places with horny singles in your area.
- It's possible.
- So what happened to the CI?
Who knows?
It was so long ago.
I mean, I barely remember how I got to work this morning.
I think there was an ambulance involved.
- Oh, there was.
- Oh.
Wait a minute.
Here's a question.
You said you recovered three duffel bags full of cash and that's what the evidence logs say as well.
- Yeah.
- So?
So count the bags.
One, two, three, like you said, but then take a look in this mirror behind you, the one that shows off your shockingly taut bottoms.
A fourth bag.
Oh, probably missed it.
Yeah, you know us.
We're dumb-dumbs.
But even you wouldn't miss a giant bag full of cash.
- It was the '80s.
- Police weren't perfect then - like they are today.
- All right, calm down.
We're not accusing you of anything, right, Jake?
- Kinda was.
- This is crazy!
- We're innocent!
- IA is railroading us like Holt said, and you're joining in the witch hunt!
You're fake news!
Sad!
Yeah, that's definitely the language of the innocent.
Okay, so there are two questions on the table.
First, who was more bang-able, young Hitchcock or young Scully?
Young Hitchcock.
Total smoke show.
Agreed, but it's close, and second, did they steal a big old bag full of mob cash?
They said they didn't do anything wrong.
I believe them.
When I brought up the fourth bag, they stormed out.
Or, once again, I think you just can't help being suspicious - of everyone.
- Oh, my God.
Is that what this is about?
You're mad because I said the old sea captain you want to adopt is scamming you?
Dragomir is not a captain.
He clubs the fish in the bottom of the boat.
That's his after-school job.
Okay, Charles, you are letting your emotions cloud your judgment with Dragomir and with these guys.
I mean, for all we know, Hitchcock and Scully have been playing us for years like criminal masterminds.
Okay, so maybe not masterminds, but I'm still going in there and getting the truth.
All right, guys, let's not make this any more difficult than it has to be.
We know there was a fourth bag of money.
- Where'd it go?
- We told you dorks.
We never saw it.
Now leave us alone.
I don't think you get what's happening here.
This is an interrogation, and it's only gonna end one way: with you telling us everything.
-  - Something funny?
It's just I don't think you get what's happening here.
You're locked in a small, windowless room with the two of us one hour after lunch.
- Oh no.
- You want to know what we ate?
Four-cheese pizza, double-cheese, with a side of cheesy fries, extra cheese, and a big old slice of cheesecake.
But, Scully, - you're lactose intolerant.
- Yeah.
This whole room is a  Dutch oven.
What the hell is this?
The downstairs people keep making a mess of the microwave.
One of them thought it was cool to heat up soup in an uncovered dish.
- That's just crazy!
- How do you know that's our splatter?
There are some sloppy Susans upstairs.
I saw it go down.
It was one of you, - so ya banned.
- No way.
This microwave belongs to the entire precinct, so I'm nah-banned.
Actually, turns out, this microwave is not precinct property.
Detective O'Shea brought it from home - back in '98, so - Ya banned.
I went to visit O'Shea's widow.
- - He's dead?
- Big-time.
She is not over it.
Anyway, I got her to sign a contract that states the upstairs has exclusive microwave rights.
You bothered a widow with this?
Honestly, it wasn't that awkward for me.
Rosa did it.
It was rough, but she signed it, so ya banned.
Okay, now that we can all breathe, let's try this again, unless you want to try and stink up the entire city of New York.
Challenge accepted.
Okay, everyone, be cool!
Be cool!
Just tell me everything that happened after the bust.
I'll tell you what happened.
We were frigging heroes.
Anybody have a trash can?
'Cause Flat Top and the Freak are bringing in some garbage.
You guys had badass entrance lines and people cheered?
What happened?
Where'd it all go wrong?
Some things aren't for us to know.
Look, guys, we never had that money.
Here.
We'll prove it to you.
Those are our financial records.
I don't have any retirement.
I don't have any security, or a car.
I rent most of my clothes.
We get it.
You're poor.
I'm not just poor, son.
I'm destitute.
Definitely not a wink-able line.
Ugh, look at all these credit card charges for Wing Slutz.
It can't be healthy to eat there this much.
If you want a diet option, the Marine Park location has a blue cheese parfait.
You guys go all the way down to Marine Park for wings?
There's a waitress there who always gives us an extra drumstick - in our slut bucket.
- Wait a minute.
Why do you pay for a monthly parking spot?
Because it's New York.
It's hard to park.
Yeah, but he just said he doesn't have a car.
So what's parked in this spot you don't want us to know about?
Could it be a super-expensive sports car, paid for in cash?
Nope.
It's just a sketchy old sex van.
There is nothing sketchy about the Beaver Trap.
Yes, there is.
In short, Commissioner Kelly's new initiative is a regressive, wrongheaded return to the NYPD's darkest days.
How was that?
Like watching a corpse wash up on shore, lifeless.
Come on, you gotta pace it up, okay?
You need to smile more.
Energize the eyes!
Gesticulate!
You're describing the behavior of a crazy person.
Am I?
Because right now, you can't take your eyes off me.
-  - Oh, that must be the camera crew, here to set up the remote.
Oh, but you're not ready.
This is gonna be like "The King's Speech," before he lost all that weight or whatever.
- I haven't seen that movie.
- Oh, it's fine, Gina.
I don't need any tricks.
I've got the truth, and the truth is all I need to bring down Commissioner Kelly!
Hello.
So, Hitchcock, what's the deal with the secret van?
Oh, nothing.
It's where I sleep during my divorces.
If this van's a-rocking, my ex-wife's a-locking me, out of her house.
- Catchy.
-  What are we doing here, Jake?
- What are we even looking for?
- Whatever it is that Hitchcock's trying to hide from us.
I'd imagine he'd be hiding everything in here from us.
- It's a van of horrors.
- Yeah, I know.
I saw the bucket of male body butter, and her.
But my gut tells me there's a smoking gun in here.
It's like you want them to be guilty.
I don't.
I just want to know what happened, unlike you, who doesn't want them to be guilty, no matter what the truth is.
I'm not an idiot just because I have a heart.
Well, your heart just might be an idiot, because voilÃ !
So many smells.
Shouldn't have gone - for the flourish.
- Wait, is that - The fourth bag from the picture.
Same logo, same stain under the handle, and It's empty.
They're guilty!
Nuh-uh.
Not necessarily.
I mean, there could be a very good  Damn it.
We're trapped!
We're trapped in the Beaver Trap!
We're the beavers!
We're the beavers!
It won't budge.
I can't believe we let Hitchcock and Scully get the drop on us.
It's like being outsmarted by a couple of tomatoes.
I'm the tomato.
I was wrong about them, and I'm probably wrong about Dragomir.
I'm too nice.
I let every random jerk suckle at the teat of my human kindness.
Gross.
Now please hand me that mannequin's leg.
There were so many warning signs about Dragomir.
Nikolaj had never heard of him - He's 45.
- He asked for money.
- He's 45.
- He didn't have - a birth certificate.
- He's 45.
- He looked older than 15.
- He's 45.
Fine.
He was 45.
I'm just a sucker, trapped in a creepy sex van.
Don't say that.
It's not true.
You're no longer trapped in a van.
Oh, crap.
They took our car.
All right, I'll just call them and beg them to turn themselves in.
Oh, no.
I left my phone in the car.
I know it's under one of their butts.
Ooh, if they have your phone, we can track where they're going.
I have "Find My Phone" set up to track you.
What?
I do that for all my friends, not just you.
Show me.
There's no time!
Look, they're headed south on the Belt Parkway.
Ooh, check what exit they're taking.
Marine Park.
They're going to Wing Slutz!
But how do we get there?
We don't have a car.
But we do have a van.
Yeah, we should have taken a Lyft.
I feel like a predator.
This isn't our car!
- It's a loaner.
- We respect women!
I'm still with her!
So you are doing a TV interview?
- That's cool.
- Why are you smiling?
'Cause he's one of those friendly villains, like the Verizon guy who defected to Sprint.
If you're angry, come out and say it.
I'm not angry.
I'm just curious about what all this means.
It's not often that one of our captains makes an unapproved media appearance.
- It's fun.
- I plan on using this interview to criticize you and your policies.
Okay.
That's your prerogative.
No, don't chuckle.
A frown is a more appropriate response.
- I like you, Raymond.
- No, you don't.
I do!
And I just came down here to tell you that if you go through with this interview, I have some real fun ideas about ways to spice up life at the Nine-Nine.
I don't like your threats, and I don't like the cheery manner in which you've chosen to deliver them.
Well, I'm just a cheery guy.
- You're a snake.
- Okay.
I'm a snake.
Oh, no, they found us!
Damn straight, we did.
What were you thinking?
They obviously weren't thinking about anyone, especially the one friend me who had their backs and believed in them the whole time!
Why is the little one so mad?
He's going through something.
Now stand up, wet wipe your hands, and put them behind your backs so we can cuff you.
Oh, thank God.
I'm so tired of running.
- It's only been an hour.
- Stop.
They didn't do anything wrong.
Excuse me, ma'am.
This is police business.
I know.
I'm Donna, the manager here, but my real name's Marissa Costa.
I'm Gio Costa's wife, and I'm the reason they're here.
- You were the informant.
- Yeah, I was.
Marissa's the only reason we got Costa.
And our captain screwed her over.
He wouldn't put her in Witness Protection.
So you did take the cash.
You just didn't keep it.
You gave it to her.
We come down here and check on her periodically.
Yeah, we never spoke, but if she put an extra wing in our slut bucket, it meant everything was okay.
Wait, so I was right.
Hitchcock and Scully are good people.
You bet your nips we are, skid mark.
Well, people are complicated.
These two contain - multitudes.
- Yeah.
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to say that I talked to my squad, and we're sorry we've been so disrespectful - of your space.
- Really?
- What's going on here?
- Nothing.
We just want to make things right.
You upstairs people are really great, and there's a lot we can learn from you.
Well, that is true.
We are pretty great, and you downstairs people are gonna figure it out.
- You're all right.
- Thanks, Terry.
- Truce?
- Truce.
Now!
-  - What the hell?
You thought the microwave was a mess before?
Well, we just threw a whole fish in there.
What happened to the truce?
- The truce was crap.
- You bet it was.
Viva the downstairs people!
What the hell was in that fish?
I don't know.
It's from the Gowanus.
It probably ate a bunch of batteries Diaz, what is going on?
Commissioner Kelly is still in my office.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
We were just having a minor disagreement.
Well, can it!
I am struggling for the very soul of the NYPD, so please stop squabbling over these unimportant things.
Of course, sir, but it's not unimportant.
The overcrowding, the desks it's affecting morale.
Jeez, something smells funky.
What happened here?
Uh-oh.
Was it a fight, because it's so crowded?
I hope nothing else happens to make everything worse.
Listen, Kelly, I'm going to do that interview, and you can't stop me, so go ahead.
Cut our budget, close more of the building, open other fake IA investigations - into my detectives.
- I didn't do that.
No, the IA thing your detectives aren't under investigation, although it's not a bad idea.
Hey, thanks for the suggestion.
Excuse me.
I need to make a call.
Okay, thank you, sir.
Hey, guys, I have something super important to tell you, but first, Scully, you have a Hitler sauce moustache.
Thank you.
Go on.
Internal Affairs isn't actually investigating your case.
That call you got wasn't real.
What?
The guy on the phone sounded legit.
He had a very deep voice.
If it's not IA, who is it?
My guess is someone who wanted us to lead them to Marissa.
Which, apparently, we just did.
That's Gio Costa.
How'd he get out of jail?
Probably for good behavior.
He had really great manners.
Yeah, he and his gigantic gun look like real sweethearts.
- Noice.
- All right, we gotta get out of here.
Is there a back exit?
- Through the kitchen.
- Great.
All right, listen up, everybody.
We're NYPD.
If you could all please head to the back exit immediately.
Leave the wings, Hitchcock.
No!
Look, Jake, it's the slut sauce!
- It's perfect!
- Hey, guys, we gotta leave, and we gotta leave right now.
- Charles, let's go.
- Negative.
I count three, possibly four gunmen out there.
All right, no one panic.
I'm sure they didn't even see us come in here.
-  - We saw you go back there.
Okay, so I was wrong about that.
I'm gonna go around back and cut them off.
Knock this door down, now.
All right, here's the way I see it.
We gotta break out the back entrance and get these people to the van.
Okay, everyone, just follow my lead.
No, we got you into this mess.
We'll get you out of it.
Follow our lead.
There are armed men out there.
We don't even have our bulletproof vests.
We can use the slut sauce.
That's insane.
It's not even solid.
The bullets will go right through it.
If you don't think the slut sauce is solid, then you might want to talk to my rock-hard arteries.
We're doing this, and that's final.
Scully, it's time to sauce up.
- Why'd you stop yelling?
- Look.
Oh, thank god.
My wife and my dad are here.
I mean, Captain Dad.
I mean, I know who my dad is.
It's you.
Hi, Amy.
SWAT just cleared out the dining room.
- They got everyone.
- Copy that.
All right, Charles, you can bring everyone out.
The Nine-Nine is here.
See, everyone, I told you we had it all under control.
There was no need to panic.
You're dead, Marissa.
No!
Are you guys okay?
Did you get hit?
No.
It hit the tub, but the bullet didn't make it through.
The slut sauce it saved you.
You bet your nips it did, skid mark.
Oh, Hitchcock.
You suck, man.
So I spoke to Internal Affairs, and since Hitchcock and Scully did steal that money, even though it was to help someone, there have to be consequences.
Desk duty, desk duty, desk duty One year of desk duty.
Yeah!
Oh, I mean, oh, no.
Thanks for getting there so fast today, sir.
Were you able to still do your interview?
He did not.
However, I did so.
The real question is what are police?
I'm sorry.
Who are you again?
They said they've never had more viewer complaints.
Controversial and loving it.
- Oh.
- Squad, I want to apologize.
I have been acting as though nothing mattered except my pursuit of justice, but seeing my people in danger today made me realize I was being short-sighted.
I do give a hoot.
I give a hoot about all of you.
Are we gonna keep saying "hoots"?
Is this forever?
- I pray not.
- I'm gonna keep pushing back against John Kelly, - but not at your expense.
- Thank you, sir, and we're going to stop bickering with the upstairs people.
No, Amy.
We're all upstairs people now.
Thanks, Terry.
Mmkay.
I clearly missed a whole thing there.
Hey, man.
I just want to say I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
I was wrong about Hitchcock and Scully.
No, you were right.
I am too trusting sometimes.
I did a little digging on Dragomir.
Turns out, he's not 15.
He's - 103.
- 34.
But the orphanage confirmed he is actually Nikolaj's half-brother.
Anyway, we're taking it slow.
In a few months, he'll come out to visit.
Hey, thanks for having our back today.
These are from the old studs of the Nine-Nine - to the new studs.
- Aww.
- Nice.
- Nice.
Well, I think they drank out of these.
- They're half-empty.
- Definitely.
Hitchcock's contact lens is floating in mine, which once again begs the question, what happened to those guys?
I mean, when did it all fall apart?
Hey, Donna, just want to make sure you're okay here working at Wing Slutz.
Yeah.
It's a good job, and I'm excited about my new life.
- Thanks.
- Our pleas.
Well, we're gonna go hit the gym - for the second time today.
- Wait.
You need some protein to fuel those hard bodies.
- It's on me.
- Ah, what the heck.
One wing can't hurt.
[Berlin's "Take My Breath Away" playing Take my breath away Take my breath away
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Attention, squad.
Put your hands together for the long-anticipated reunion of The DDC!
- DD - C!
- DD - C!
Put a J with a G You get DD  C!
Uh, the gas face.
What the hell is the DDC?
I don't know, but I love it!
The DDC is the Dope - Denim - Crew.
Our 20-year high school reunion is tonight, and the party is '90s-themed, so we're dressing the way we did back then, AKA hella fresh.
Can't wait to see everyone we graduated with and lie to them about what I've been up to for my own amusement.
It's gonna be Fib City, population: Gina Clooney.
But Jake, how can you be excited to return to your high school, the scene of Tattlegate?
What's Tattlegate?
Why haven't I heard anything about it?
It was junior year and Jake was riding high Charles, no one wants to hear this story from you.
It was junior year, and Jake was riding high.
Sophomore year was rough, but now I was back with a hot new look: an earring and long hair.
Which was my look, and he just copied it.
And it worked!
I was finally cool, and becoming friends with the most popular kid in school: Brandon Bliss.
- Dope name; sounds hot.
- He was hot, Rosa.
For the record, he could barely read.
He didn't have to read, Gina.
He lost his virginity when he was 12 years old.
Which is horrifying.
But it wasn't back then!
Back then, it was everything.
He asked me to ditch class one day with him and his buddies, steal a school van, and go get drunk at his parents' cabin, but the day before we were supposed to go, someone ratted Brandon out, and he got suspended!
He thought I was the one who told, and from that day forward, everyone called me "The Tattler".
Tattler.
It's a sexy nickname.
It was not a sexy nickname!
It was a scarlet letter, and it ruined my senior year, but luckily, I'm over all that now.
Not me.
I'm gonna go to this reunion tonight and kick Brandon Bliss in the butthole.
Horrifying, but that won't be necessary, Charles, for my awesome life will do the butthole-kicking this eve.
I've got a sweet job, and a super-smart, incredible wife.
Tonight's gonna be awesome.
- Right, Gina?
- Damn straight!
- DD - C!
- DD - C!
- DD - C!
Wow, this place hasn't changed one bit in 20 years.
It's a real indictment of the public school system.
Jake!
Tina!
No way!
Mikey J!
Amy, this is Mike Joseph, AKA the lead funk bassist from my legendary ska band, Skalvester Skallone.
We had one song.
Oh  Stop or my mom will ska Stop or my mom will ska - Whoa!
- Hey, man.
We were so bad.
I can't believe we thought we were gonna make it.
So what have you been up to, man?
Well, I'm still trying to get the music thing started.
Oh, cool, cool, cool.
Never give up.
Anyway, how are you, Gina?
What have you been up to?
Nothing crazy.
Yeah, just writing - those "Thor" movies.
- Seriously?
Oh, my God.
Tell me everything.
Legally, I can't get into it too much, but just know that the next one will have a lot more full frontal.
Well, if you need some ska for your soundtrack Oh!
This is them.
This is Marvel.
They probably want to talk about "Thor 4: More Thor".
I gotta take this.
- Okay?
- All right.
So how you doing, Jake?
I know the end of high school was a little rough.
Oh, uh Jake's killing it now.
He's a detective.
Irie, mon!
Irie, irie!
Very nice.
God, you must have some crazy stories.
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, is successfully negotiating a high-tension hostage situation in a bank crazy?
Yes!
Oh, well, then, I guess I do have some crazy stories, mon!
Gosh, it's so cool how we all still dress the same.
Is it so much to ask?
You know what I'm saying?
Why is everyone gathered around the radio?
Ooh, are they testing the emergency broadcasting system?
What?
No.
We're listening to a contest.
This is 93.7, The Jamhouse, with  JC and the Horndog!
FM radio Yeah, the hosts are beyond disgusting, but they do a fun game where they play a mystery sound and callers guess what it is for a cash prize.
Shh, they're about to play the new sound!
It's a crinkle.
I solved it.
Yes, but you have to know what object is making the crinkle.
But that's impossible.
It could be anything.
Yes, sir.
That's the game.
It's a bag of potato chips.
Don't be an idiot!
It's a bag of corn chips.
Well, this is a total waste of time.
Sure, but you can still have fun, - even if you're wasting time.
- That's absurd.
Productivity is what makes things fun.
That's why humans go to work.
It is?
Hey.
So you know how Alicia and I broke up because she moved to London, then we tried to make it work, but the distance was too much and we broke up again?
No.
The last thing you told me about yourself was that you were bi.
Well, a lot has happened since then.
Anyway, I'm dating two other people.
So much juice at one time.
I'm drowning.
Oh, gross.
Charles, this is why I don't tell you anything.
- I take it back.
- Okay.
Well, it's early stages, but they both tagged me in a bunch of photos online, and they found out about each other.
- Yikes.
- Yeah, I know.
I shouldn't 'gram so much, but my brunch friends say it's the only way to promote my handmade jewelry line.
Brunch?
What?
- Homemade who - Charles, focus.
Anyway, they're both annoyed, and now I have to choose one of them, and I cannot make up my mind.
It's insane.
I never have trouble making decisions.
Ugh.
Choose the daughter.
I always know exactly what to do, but for the first time in my life, I am stumped.
Rosa, you've come to the right man.
Boyles are genetically indecisive beings.
So I chose the worst possible person to help me?
No.
We've developed a foolproof system to help us make choices.
It used to take me so long to decide what to wear that I'd never change my clothes.
Now look what I have on.
Is this different than what you were wearing yesterday?
Barely.
Wow, your life sounds amazing.
I'm really happy it worked out for you, you know, especially with the whole Tattler thing.
What?
The Tattler?
Wow.
I haven't heard that in a long time.
Who even was the Tattler?
You.
That's why I'm bringing it up.
Oh, right, I remember now that I was misidentified as the Tattler.
That's so funny.
But I wasn't the Tattler, so I'm pretty sure you got this wrong.
No, no, no, I think I go Hey, Eric.
Didn't people call Jake the Tattler?
Oh, yeah!
Oh, good, more people are getting involved.
After my initial design, they said it couldn't be done.
They said it was too tall, too flashy building codes, bureaucracy.
Cut to the Freedom Tower as you see it today.
Wow.
Thank you.
Yeah, I agree.
Look, nobody cares about that stuff.
We're all adults now.
You're a cop.
I work at a coffin factory.
I'm not sitting around, thinking about how you tattled.
Yes, we all have jobs and work on coffins.
I didn't tattle, but whatevs.
We don't have to keep talking about it.
ALL,  Great.
But you were the Tattler, right?
Brandon Bliss was my friend!
Why would I tattle on my friend?
The nickname was inaccurate, is all I'm saying.
Anyways, as you can tell, I am totally over it.
Ah, man, it's the Tattler.
I didn't tattle!
So I think I might not be over it.
Ugh, this is so unfair.
Everyone remembers me as the Tattler, but somehow, no one remembers that Darren "Doo Doo" Donaldson crapped himself during PE.
Look at him out there, dancing on the dance floor like he's lived a doo doo-free life.
Jake, this isn't so bad.
History is full of great tattlers.
Martin Luther King tattled on racists.
That's a pretty undercutting way of describing his accomplishments.
I was trying to help.
It felt bad.
It's not even the nickname that bothers me.
It's that I'm being wrongfully accused.
I didn't tattle.
I mean, if it was the truth, go ahead and call me the Tattler all day long.
- Hey, Tattler.
- Not cool, Jason!
Let's just go home.
No!
We're not going anywhere.
You were wrongfully accused.
We're cops.
Let's just find the real Tattler and prove your innocence.
Yes!
I love it!
Why learn to grow when you can fix the past?
This is exactly why I don't need therapy.
Not sure that's the lesson I want you to take away from this.
Too late!
We're gonna prove I wasn't the Tattler.
Therapy is a scam.
Let's do this.
No.
The sound was more of a "khh".
Ooh, how goes the crinkle hunt?
I see you're not just wasting time.
You're also wasting tin.
It was only one piece.
Okay, it was a ton of tin.
Pretty sure it's a guy eating a sandwich.
I'll prove it to you.
I'm not buying you any more sandwiches, Scully.
- I'm doing this for us!
- Guys, we can't fight.
That's what the Horndog wants.
We're getting close.
We just need to keep testing more things.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Have you tried a piece of paper?
Is that your crinkle?
Ooh, maybe oh.
Maybe it's these bags of coffee beans.
All right, sir.
I think you've made your point.
My point?
Oh, I'm just trying to have fun by wasting time.
Oh, maybe it's this crinkly-crunkly yogurt.
Terry heard a crinkle.
Holt heard a crinkle, too.
So suddenly, it's not a waste of time?
Not a waste of time if we win!
What are you waiting for, Jeffords?
Call the Horndog!
So then I said to Steve, "What if we drop the '-lications,' just call them 'apps'"?
That's incredible.
- Do you miss him?
- Oh, every day, Laura.
- Every day.
- You should talk to Quentin Chase.
He's a big-time Silicon Valley investor now, and he was just telling me all about it.
Quentin, come here.
You have got to talk to Gina.
She basically invented apps.
They were going to be called "lications".
You really bungled that.
What you been working on?
Currently, I have been working on an app called Toddler.
It's like Tinder, but for toddlers.
Tinder for toddlers.
I like it.
How are you gonna spell that?
How many D's?
- Five.
-  All right, we should start by talking to Brandon Bliss and find out who told him you were the Tattler.
Unfortunately, Bliss is not here.
Probably in the VIP section at a Fatboy Slim concert.
Would that be cool for a 37-year-old?
The funk soul brother is timeless, Ames.
All right, I don't know who told Brandon, but I heard it was someone on the football team.
Okay, well, we need more information than that, so take me back to the day.
Spare no details.
Okay, I saw Brandon after second period, and everything seemed tight.
- - Hey now, you're an all-star Get your game on go play But then, when I saw him after third period - - something had clearly changed.
Get paid  All that glitters is gold After that, there was little color left in the world for young Jake.
My earring, less gold, my JNCO jeans less purple.
Are you sure you were becoming cool?
Yeah.
Why?
I know how to solve this.
We just have to find out which football player had third period with Brandon Bliss.
We need his class schedule.
Yeah, but where are we gonna find that?
In the coolest room in the school.
Good lord!
You coulda just picked the lock.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm just so amped up about Admin.
Okay, this is the Boyle decision-making manual.
One of these sections will help you with choosing your partner.
Here we go.
What do you prefer, eyes or butt, brains or body?
- Brains.
- Uh Sorry, no, that's for deciding lunch.
- Horrifying.
- Oh, I found the romance section.
Now, first, I will need the names of the two people you're choosing between.
I will not be telling you any information about them.
No problem.
We can work with that.
I will just call them by their initials.
- No.
- I will call them - "Couscous" and "Quinoa".
- Whatever.
Okay, now, for this to work right, you need to answer these questions without thinking.
- Who makes you laugh more?
- Quinoa.
- Who has softer lips?
- Couscous.
A new Cirque du Soleil's in town.
You have the two best seats in the house.
- Who are you bringing?
- Is this a reward or a punishment?
- You decide.
- Quinoa.
Great.
Next question: You die and become a ghost.
The rules of the afterlife are that of the movie "Casper".
Whose house would you rather haunt?
How many more of these questions are there?
- 309.
-  - Okay, I've got something.
- Oh.
That's not Brandon's profile.
It's mine.
I just want a quick peek at your attendance record.
Zero absences.
Oh, mama Printing this for later.
Keep it in your pants, Santiago.
Oh, that's exactly where it's going.
Okay, here's Brandon's info.
Third period, first semester Any of these people on the football team?
Scott Alford, Taylor Black wow, Tom Brady?
Different Tom Brady.
He was in theater.
Although he was the MVP of that year's production of "Fiddler".
- Hm.
- Wait a minute.
Danny Matthews.
That's the guy.
He was on the football team.
That's the bastard who set me up.
Yeah, and look at this.
You did so much community service.
Me like-y.
Guys, you know how I thought it would be so much fun to lie to everyone tonight?
Yeah.
Did it finally catch up with you?
No, the opposite.
Someone wants to buy a company I made up on the spot.
The elevator pitch had him drooling.
As a mother, I'm always struggling to find quality playdates.
Most two-year-olds are boring, lame duds.
All of my daughter's friends suck.
Well, with Todddddler's proprietary algorithm, you will be matched with top tots, and those boring duds they'll stay where they belong: the hell away from you and your family.
I'm not really sure how to close this.
Maybe you guys could pretend to be heirs to a canned-goods fortune who want to buy my company!
Gina, we don't have time for your thing right now.
Oh, smart.
Big-time him.
That's the perfect idea.
I won't forget you when I'm rich.
Thanks so much, Jake and Jake's wife.
She knows your name.
Oh, look!
It's Danny Matthews!
But he'll never talk with all these people around.
Not a problem.
Just be in the science lab in ten minutes.
I'll get him alone.
What are you gonna do?
Let's just say I'm not above using my feminine wiles.
Danny Matthews, I'm with the school.
You need to follow me right now.
- Is everything - I said now, mister.
I'm one caller away.
I can't believe we figured it out.
And I can't believe it took you this long.
Yogurt is literally your one thing.
- Okay, okay.
- Well, I'm just saying.
If the sound were eating damp rice, I would've gotten it immediately.
Guys, they're taking another guess.
All right, Brenda from Yonkers.
It's time for you to name that sound.
Hi.
Quick shout-out to the nurses at United Pediatric.
This money'll do those kids a lot of good.
Cry me a river.
Brenda from Yonkers.
We've all had budget cuts.
Just take your guess.
Is it Styrofoam?
- Wrong!
-  Oh, I can't believe she guessed Styrofoam.
What a dumb nurse.
Next caller, you're on with the Horndog.
It's me!
The sound is a yogurt being opened.
- That is -  - Wrong!
-  What?
No!
You b-b-b-blew it!
Damn you, Horndog.
Okay, I have tabulated your responses, and the results are definitive.
- Amazing.
- It's a dead tie.
This is dumb.
I'm just gonna end it - with both of them.
- Rosa, stop.
There is one more method.
Ancient Boyles believed that suspending yourself by your feet forces your blood to the decision center of your brain.
We call this method the "Upside-Down Coward".
You want me to hang from the ceiling like a bat?
The bat is nature's most decisive animal.
The creature that flails around frantically?
Those are all micro-decisions.
Now, let's get you strapped up.
How do you feel?
Nauseous.
Good.
It's working.
- Q?
- Yeah.
Get off the phone.
Now, I'm not sure how serious you were about funding, but I should tell you there's 103 other bidders.
Oof, I am not a fan of getting into bidding wars.
Then don't make an offer, 'cause I want babies on my app, but not in my boardroom.
Oh, damn, Gina.
Did you just "oh, damn" yourself?
Someone had to.
Okay.
Let's talk numbers.
Mr. Peralta, I believe you know Danny Matthews.
Jake.
Hey, what's going on, man?
The answer to that question goes back to a brisk day in 1997, a day you told a lie.
But the lying stops right now!
Oh, no!
You broke some poor kid's science project!
We have to fix it.
Kind of in the middle of something.
Oh, you know what?
Krebs cycle.
I got this.
Great.
So, Danny, true or false?
You were on the football team.
- True?
- And true or false: you had third period with Brandon Bliss.
Mm, I honestly don't remember It was true!
We checked the records, and I have one more question.
Ooh, Jake, can you get me that oxygen on the floor?
- Little red guy.
- What?
Sorry.
You know what?
Yeah, I'll get it.
Why did you tell Brandon Bliss that I was the Tattler?
Because you were.
I saw you talking to principal.
I remember it, clear as day.
Look, you couldn't have seen me, because I wasn't there.
I didn't tattle.
Man, it was you, okay?
You had your long hair and your little earring, and the denim jacket you are literally wearing right now.
Oh, no.
It wasn't me, but it was the DDC.
Gina.
Jake, guess who just sold her app idea.
Don't trust her.
Everything she's told you is a lie.
She made up the company and everything else.
She's a liar.
Jake, whatever strategy this is is not necessary.
I already closed the deal.
I know you were the Tattler.
Amy, I'm ready to go.
Yep, totally.
I'm almost done with this project, but I don't need to finish it, because what matters is that you are going through something, and as your wife, and love of your life Are you vamping so you can finish that?
I only have two molecules left.
- Come on, man.
- Jake, we need to talk.
Yeah, you guys do need to talk.
That sounds excellent.
Friendship, so much history I'm just gonna get this out of your way.
Oh, man.
What the hell, Gina?
You ruined my entire senior year.
How could you do that to me?
Jake, I was only trying to help.
You were hanging out with those guys and getting close, and they weren't good people.
Do you know why Brandon wasn't at the reunion tonight?
I don't know.
Probably 'cause he was shooting a beer commercial where the whole plot was that everyone wanted to sleep with him.
No, 'cause he's on parole.
He's not allowed to leave the state of Delaware.
Oh, okay, so that's obviously a bummer, but I wasn't gonna end up like him.
You were starting to.
You wanted to steal a van with him, and I told you not to, and you weren't listening to me.
I mean, what would've happened if you got caught?
I don't know.
You would never have become a cop.
Yeah, I'm the reason you're a cop.
I'm your origin story, dude.
You can't be mad at me.
I feel like I'm still pretty mad.
Peter Parker wasn't mad at his spider.
Yeah, but they weren't best friends before the bite, and it still doesn't explain how you let everyone think I was the Tattler for 20 years.
Well, I didn't want to lose our friendship.
I was being weak.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
And if it makes you feel any better, that app thing completely blew up in my face.
I mean, my night sucked.
Okay, I can see from your expression that your night was worse, and I should've left it at "sorry".
So did you hear?
Someone guessed the sound.
It was a bag of chips.
Wow.
So the lesson here is to listen to Hitchcock and Scully more?
- No, that can't be possible.
- Yeah, I don't think - we earned that today.
- Agreed.
Sorry for dragging you into that dumb game.
You were right.
It was a waste of time.
No, it wasn't.
Even though it was pointless, I did enjoy myself.
I can't wait to go home and tell Kevin you can have fun without being productive.
Hey, guys, they're about to play the new mystery sound.
I can tell Kevin tomorrow.
I'll bet Sharon's already asleep.
And I've got no one in my life.
Scully, play that damn noise.
Quentin, can I talk to you for a minute?
Are you here to give me a long speech about how you still deserve my money?
No.
I am.
Very cool entrance.
Thank you.
Listen.
Gina Linetti is not a perfect person.
Mm, I'm hoping this gets more supportive as it goes along.
But what she lacks in perfection, she makes up for with an utter and total belief that she is perfect.
Ooh, you said "but," and then you said - something worse.
- She is fiercely loyal.
She will do the right thing for you even when you can't see it for yourself, and she's saved my ass countless times.
And it's been 12.
I counted.
She came up with an idea on the spot that you were interested in.
Imagine what she could do with time and resources.
Do the world a favor.
Invest in Gina Linetti.
Hard pass.
-  What?
- But my great speech.
Yeah, the speech was great, but I've also been lying the whole night.
I'm not a tech mogul.
I came here to mess with people.
- How dare you?
- Speaking of which, did either one of you drive?
'Cause I could use a ride.
- No, Quentin.
- Oh, Quentin.
Okay.
Now open your eyes, and the person you are meant to be with should appear before you.
Sorry.
I was just watching.
Get out of here, Hitchcock!
- Ugh.
- This isn't working.
I'm no closer to making a decision.
I'm jumping down.
Well, you can't just jump down.
- My goodness!
- It's over.
I'm gonna put 'em both in a group text - and say "peace out".
- Uh, no!
There's still more options.
We haven't even done roleplay yet.
- What?
-  Ugh.
I took too long getting back to Quinoa and they got mad and ended it.
And that's how it's done.
- What are you talking about?
- The process worked.
Boyles don't make decisions.
We delay our decisions until the universe makes them for us.
That way, we never make a wrong choice.
That is very sad, but also, I guess it worked.
- Mm-hmm.
- I do feel pretty good.
Couscous is dope.
She's funny.
Couscous is a she!
I knew it!
- Did you?
- No, and I still don't know.
There's equal chance you called them "she" to throw me off.
You get me, Boyle.
So I think I figured out an awesome and dramatic way to reveal that I was the Tattler.
It'll be a dance.
There'll be costumes.
Gina, it's fine.
I don't care anymore.
- It's all in the past.
- Oh, thank God.
That is such a relief, 'cause I didn't want people thinking I was a tattler.
Where's Amy?
She is in the library, writing a book report on "Jane Eyre," and she told me "not to wait up".
- Oy.
- Yeah.
Thanks for trying to help with Quentin.
It's funny.
Even though it wasn't real, it was so fun, imagining running my own company.
So why don't your pursue it?
I can't raise my kid and create an app and work at the Nine-Nine.
It's too much.
Well, then prepare for me to murder your parents right in front of your face.
- Rude.
- No.
It's Batman's origin story, like the radioactive spider thing you did with me.
I don't read comic books.
You helped me become who I am, so now I'm gonna return the favor.
Gina I think your talents might be wasted at the Nine-Nine.
I love you, but it might be time for you to move on.
Um, are you firing me?
What?
No.
I don't think I could even do that.
Good, because I quit.
You know, tonight I realized that my talents are being wasted at the Nine-Nine.
Okay, that's kind of exactly what I just said.
Jake, let me finish.
This is serious.
It's time for me to move on.
For real, though, it is.
Really?
- Okay.
-  Proud of you.
Thank you.
I'm proud of me, too.
Guys!
Vice principal caught me in the library.
Let's roll!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 All right, Jeffords, what's this meeting all about?
I've got a full workload today.
I didn't call it.
I thought you did.
What?
I did no such thing.
So if neither of you called it, then who did?
- Gina.
Right.
- That makes sense.
Oh!
Oh, Sheila, that was awesome.
Okay, just stay here.
Wow, can't believe I executed that to perfection.
- That was amazing.
- Gina, what's this all about?
I wanted to make one final grand entrance.
Final?
What do you mean?
I've decided to leave the Nine-Nine.
Which is why Oh, okay.
I'm handing in my two weeks' notice.
I don't understand.
What are you gonna do?
I'm not sure, but Jake convinced me it was time to start a new chapter.
It was time to spread my wings and fly.
I'm an angel.
I'm an angel.
- I'm an angel.
- This is crazy.
I can't imagine the Nine-Nine without you.
Don't worry.
I have a parting gift for all of you.
I printed "Time for Gina's Opinion" hoodies for you with your names on them.
- Oh, there you go.
- Oh, that's fun.
So like "Time for Jake's Opinion"?
What are you, insane?
No.
It says "Time for Gina's Opinion" in large text on the back and then your names are stitched - really tiny on the front.
- Ah.
I had to guess at some of the spellings.
- Arnie?
- But that's not all.
Over the next two weeks, I will be leaving each of you with a signature Gina Moment, something so shocking that it will stay with you for the rest of your lives, much like this interpretive dance piece, entitled, "The Linexit".
This dance will be performed in four movements, each one expressing one aspect of my personality.
Oh.
Awesome.
Was that the first movement?
What?
Are you crazy?
No.
That's the warm-up.
- Each movement is 45 minutes.
- Oh, damn.
Hit it!
Hey, Craptain, you ready to get curb stomped?
- What?
- At chess.
We have a weekly match.
I'm teaching Gina to play.
And she, in turn, is teaching me to trash talk.
The hospital called.
Your test results came back positive.
You're a stage five dumbass.
Oh!
You have come so far.
- You any good, Gina?
- The best.
She struggles.
We've been playing for four years now and she has yet to defeat me.
Well, good luck.
I'm rooting for you, Gina.
You would take the losers side, Jeffords, you bitch.
- Trash talk.
- Okay.
I don't like this, I'm gonna go.
Really good, sir.
Really good.
I don't know why you're so confident you'll win.
You still don't even know the names of all the pieces.
- You dumbass.
- Nice.
But I do know the names.
I've simply rebranded them.
My queen is Rihanna.
My king is BeyoncÃ©.
And this little guy is Kevin.
Would you be willing to murder Kevin, the love of your life?
Yes.
Chess Kevin means nothing to me.
Gina, have you thought this through?
Have you considered the ramifications of what you're doing?
Yeah, I mean, I named this guy Hitchcock and now I kind of want him off the board.
I was talking about your decision to leave the Nine-Nine.
Although I understand your confusion.
There are many parallels between the game of chess - and the game of life.
- Not really.
They're just a bunch of pieces of wood on a placemat.
In chess, every move has consequences, some of which won't reveal themselves until too late.
Even a small, seemingly insignificant decision can change the course of the entire game.
I feel like you're worried I haven't considered the consequences of quitting, but I have.
I know you feel you could be doing more with your life, but you're leaving the Nine-Nine without a clear plan.
- It's reckless.
- What you don't get, but the greats do is that in order to be successful, sometimes you gotta be reckless.
Boom.
- Checkmate.
- All right, all right.
I see you.
It was a good game though for a dumbass.
Okay, you're kinda overusing that one.
Maybe switch it up a little bit.
Oh, good note.
You dick.
That landed good.
All right, re-rack.
Let's play again.
Mkay, my move?
Ah, whites go first.
Oh, chess really is like life.
Commentary.
The game you love is racist - and you're complicit.
- So what's your plan?
Not with chess, with your life moving forward.
I mean, I could do basically anything.
I could come up with a new form of cryptocurrency called GinaCoin, make millions.
Could write a YA novel about literally anything, I think, and make millions.
I could discover a new type of melon, make millions.
I'm not saying your dreams are unattainable.
But you can pursue them while you're still gainfully employed here at the Nine-Nine.
What's the rush to turn your back on stability and a paycheck?
I don't want stability and a paycheck.
I wanna take a risk.
Quote: "A bird can never learn to fly if it doesn't leave the nest".
End quote.
Gina Linetti, right now.
Quote: "The bird that leaves the nest too soon plummets to its death on the concrete below".
Captain Raymond Holt, immediately afterwards.
Nothing bad ever happens to me.
I have a crystal in my pocket at all times.
What about when you got hit by that bus?
That bus was going 60 miles per hour and here I sit before you completely fine.
And you wanna say crystals don't work?
Gina, I'm serious.
What if you get sick?
Healthcare is expensive.
What if something happens to your daughter?
- Checkmate.
- Did you just delay that victory by a few moves to punctuate your point?
- I did.
- Barf.
Rack 'em.
Okay, Captain, you made some good points.
I mean, I get what you're saying about the healthcare situation.
Checkmate.
I believe that you're smart enough and talented enough to do anything you want.
but you have to have a plan.
Mm.
Interesting.
Let me ask you something, sir.
Did you always have a plan for everything you ever did?
You always thought out every choice you ever made?
Yes.
By the time I was ten, I had mapped out my entire life.
I knew I wanted to go to the Academy.
I knew I wanted to become a detective.
- And you did it.
- Then move on to sergeant.
- And you got it.
- Next, lieutenant.
- Nailed it.
- And then, finally, captain.
Wow.
I'm convinced.
I think I should reconsider my decision.
Uh, we're not done with the game.
I know.
I just wanted to stand so I could turn slowly and say But wasn't there another step in the Holt life plan?
Gosh, what was it?
What came after captain?
I can't seem to remember for dramatic effect.
I wanted to be commissioner.
- Gina Moment.
- I get your point.
Even the best laid plans sometimes don't work out.
They sure don't.
And now it's time for Gina's closing thoughts.
Just because you wanna do something doesn't mean you get to do it.
Life is chaos, success is completely arbitrary, and confidence is everything.
I was just worried.
But I guess after working with you for five years, I should've realized - You know what you're doing.
- Thanks, Captain.
Have you thought this through?
Not at all.
And yet - Checkmate.
- That was completely illegal.
That's not at all how the queen moves.
That's how this queen moves.
Checkmate.
It's against the rules of chess.
Well, Gina Linetti done reinvented the game.
Uh, I'm supporting your overall career decision, I'm on board, but you can't assign I won both things.
Chess and the argument.
This little birdie, she gotta fly the coop.
I'm taking this with me as a little remembrance, Sir.
Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!
Ca-caw!
Hey.
What are you two up to?
Eh, I'm on my phone and Rosa's just sitting there silently.
- The yewzh.
- Well, I was thinking we could have a ladies lunch today.
Amy, I wish I could do lunch today, but I'm currently out of town.
Oh, come on.
I wanna hang out one last time before you before you leave us.
You're really special, Gina, and even though I'm sorry.
I just get so emotional about these things, you know?
I wish I could be more like Rosa.
Huh?
I got bored.
What's going on?
See?
She doesn't even give a damn.
I wish I could do that.
Then I would cry less at the bank.
It's just there's this one poster of this older Asian man opening up a savings account - for his grandson.
- Okay.
All right, here's what's gonna happen.
Amy Santiago, as my parting gift to you, before I leave your life forever We'll still see each other outside of work.
Before I leave your life forever, I'm gonna fix you.
I'm gonna teach you how to be more cool - and detached like me and Rosa.
- What's going on?
But we could still go to lunch, right?
I mean or not.
- Whatevs.
- Decent start.
Yeah, sure, I mean, we'll go to lunch with you.
- Why not?
- Okay, okay, cool.
Just before we go, I'm gonna go to go the bathroom for a bit.
Not to cry about you leaving.
But just to take a huge dump.
So if you hear any crying from the bathroom Not about you.
It's the dump.
Okay?
Gina, since you're leaving, I'd like to make a toast.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
That was perfect.
- Mm.
- So nice.
Gina, I got a little going away present for you.
Don't worry.
It's nothing big.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow.
You once said if you ever die, you wanted someone to turn your tweets into a book, so that's what I did.
Oh, my God.
I said so many witty things so fast.
Yeah.
Amy, I don't know what to say.
- This is horrifying.
- What?
This is way worse than crying.
I mean, you put so much work into this.
I'm completely uncomfortable.
It makes me Kinda makes me sick.
Amy, there's something I want you to do right now.
- Burn the book I made you?
- Yes.
It's the only way to cleanse your childish sentimentality and become the true you, the one that's really Rosa.
Okay.
Sure.
I mean, it does include a very personal forward I wrote and $75 of my best archival glue, but yeah, this feels good.
Hey.
Never seen you burning stuff at the bum barrel before.
Right on.
- What was in there, Hitchcock?
- Eh, eh, eh.
First rule of the bum barrel: never ask somebody what they're burning.
Well, okay then.
All right Amy, it's time.
Put the book in the barrel.
Let's go.
No!
I can't do it.
What?
I thought you wanted us to change you.
I thought I did too, but I don't.
I like having emotions, okay?
This is who I am.
You're leaving and that's a really big change and I'm gonna cry about it a lot, okay?
And there it is.
Another flawless Gina Moment.
What?
What's going on?
Amy, the lesson I wanted to leave you with is to just be yourself.
If you want to cry like an idiot for hours on end, just do it.
You wanna make a big old ugly book full of all my brilliant thoughts, do it.
Do you!
Thanks, Gina.
Oh, wow.
That was really, really sweet.
Oh, dip!
I got Rosa to feel her feelings too?
Inadvertent Gina Moment.
Two for one.
Come in, my babies.
Come in.
Sorry to interrupt, ladies, but you might want to take a couple of steps back.
This is not going to smell good.
- Un-hug!
Un-hug!
- Ugh!
Hey, does anyone have a contact at Ellis Island?
Ellis Island?
What's going on?
I'm trying to secure a cool venue for Gina's going away party, Gina-rama.
Oh, that invitation said "Geena-rama" not "Gyna-rama".
I thought it was weird they'd move Gyna-rama from Tampa.
It's really a warm weather event.
Wait, I'm confused.
Did the Met fall through?
That place is stuffy and lame.
And also, it's $12 million.
But the point is, I decided.
It was my call.
Just have it at Shaw's.
It doesn't have to be splashy.
It's a party for Gina.
It absolutely has to be splashy, Terrence.
Terrence, would you jump into a pool without water?
No, the splash is what keeps you alive.
- Splash is life.
- I know what you need.
An insane devil stick performance.
I have a brand-new routine that is steamy.
Boyle, we're looking for splashy, not steamy, - but thank you.
- Well, steam is what you get when you add splash to fire.
And we will not keep you in mind.
Hey, that reminds me, Gina, we still haven't secured a celebrity guest for the party.
How would you feel about the guy who shot that video of that rat smoking a vape pen?
- Can we get the rat?
- Pretty sure the rat is just a big ball of tumors at this point.
- Is that the vibe you're going for?
- Maybe.
If you want a celebrity, I met Leroy Pipe at Gyna-rama '08.
I have a buddy who works in private security.
They do protection for tons of big names.
He'll know who's in town.
Fantastic.
Please call him right now.
No need.
Leroy Pipe is in!
All he needs is bail money.
Great.
But also, Terry, you still call your guy.
- Gotcha.
- Gina, big news.
Terry's friend got back to us and he says they're doing security for Bayside High's number one wrestler: A.C. Slater.
That's right, Mario Lopez.
Oh, my God.
I had such a big crush on him.
Yeah, we all had a big crush on A.C. Slater.
Get in line!
I'll be cooler when we meet him.
- I should hope so.
- Anyways, he's hanging out at the Manhattan Club right now.
We can go there and try and talk to him.
Jake, you can't just walk into the Manhattan Club.
It's very exclusive.
Like, how exclusive are we talking here, Gines?
No jeans?
- More.
- No poor people of any kind no matter how well they hide it?
- More.
- Just a tiny slice - of the super rich?
- More.
Is it all Illuminati?
Is it just a whole room full of lizards?
- Bingo.
- Well, then I guess we'll have to transform ourselves.
Into the uber wealthy.
Charles!
Turn that music off.
Oh, sorry.
I was just practicing in case you guys change your mind.
Okay, we're about to walk into the land of money.
Remember, all rich people are monsters, so unleash the beast.
Got it.
Open it!
Good afternoon.
May I help you?
We're here all the time.
Get familiar with these faces, or get familiar with the unemployment line.
I'm so sorry, but I have to check you in.
I need a member number.
I don't have my member number with me.
It's too bad you can't just use my AmEx black card.
Oh, that's great.
We can use that.
You can?
Well.
You think I carry around my own wallet?
I'm sorry, sir.
If you could just give me a name, that would be great.
I'll give you a name: Pamplemouse La Croix.
I'm so sorry, Ms. La Croix, you're not in the system.
This is ridiculous.
You know what?
Call Daddy.
Daddy'll get us in.
Daddy, the man won't let us into the club.
- Oh, ho, ho.
- Yes, Daddy.
No, Daddy, no.
- Daddy wants to speak with you.
- Gladly.
Hello, Daddy?
Yes, Daddy.
No, Daddy.
Daddy!
Oh, well, good question, Daddy.
Daddy wants to get this young man fired.
What is your first and last name?
Uh..
You know what, forget about it.
You can just go on up.
Fantastic.
Everything's well, Daddy.
We're heading in, Daddy.
Gina, the bathrooms here are amazing.
I just peed on gold.
I peed on gold!
That's so dope, but we don't have time.
Mario Lopez is right there in the VIP.
So, how do we get him to come to your party?
- Say we're his biggest fans?
- No, Jake.
Celebrities despise their fans.
You get into entertainment to be removed - from general society.
- Oh, okay.
So what do we say?
Well, whilst stars hate people, they love animals.
'Cause animals have bad bodies so they're no competition.
Okay, so we say the party is for monkeys.
- Monkeys with malaria.
- Malnourished malaria monkeys.
God, it's ridiculous how good we are at this.
- Let's go in.
- Wait, I don't think there's any way we're getting past those security guards.
We need a distraction.
Ooh, how about this.
I'll sprint past them, and whilst they're chasing after me, you sneak into the VIP.
Wow, we said "whilst" twice in this conversation.
I know, this place is really rubbing off on us.
Heads up!
Catch me if you did!
You immediately did!
Stop it!
I'm telling Daddy!
Daddy!
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
- Hey.
- Hey, homey.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm totally fine.
It really wasn't that bad of a beating.
I don't know why I'm lying.
You were there.
You held me as I wept.
Anyways, sorry that Gina-rama has been a little basic so far, but all of that is about to change.
Because guess who just pulled up outside?
- He came?
- A.C. Sla-t-er!
Yes, dude!
I'm sorry!
Everyone, be cool!
He's here!
Hey, is this the hungry monkey thing?
It sure is, A.C. Slater!
I'm so sorry, Mr. Lopez.
I know you're not actually the very iconic character - that you played.
- You sure about that, preppy?
This is the best moment of my life.
So what's up?
Can I, uh, come in and get a drink?
Mm, actually, I'm sorry, the venue's at capacity.
There's just too many people inside.
- What?
- Wait, I was told that this event depended on me.
You just begged me, like, an hour ago.
And now I'm begging you to stop embarrassing yourself 'cause it's not a good shade on you.
Are you really not gonna let me in?
There's nothing I can do, I'm sor hey, Scully.
Hi, Gina.
I brought my own pigs in a blanket!
- Dope.
- Who's that guy?
- Scully.
- Mario, you gotta calm down.
And you gotta walk away.
It's over.
Hey, Gina!
What are you doing?
We had A.C. Slater right there and you turned him away?
And that, Jake, was your Gina Moment.
What?
But that sucked.
Why was mine a bad one?
Because Jake, I wanted you to understand I don't need a celebrity or some crazy venue or a huge good-bye party.
This is what I wanted.
Just to hang with my friends and have a few drinks and laugh at Charles with his devil sticks until he makes eye contact you're killing it, bud.
You guys are all the splash that I need.
Oh, man.
- Gina.
- Mm-hmm.
- You big cheese ball.
- I know.
Plus, it's so cool that I got to turn a celebrity away from my party.
That was kinda my Gina Moment for me.
I've always wanted to do that.
- Right.
Right.
- Hey, um It's raining outside.
Is it cool if I just wait here - until my car comes?
- Get out of here, Slater!
Get out!
Yeah?
Yeah!
- I can't believe Gina's gone.
- Me neither.
Hey, did you get a Gina Moment?
She said she was giving one to everyone, - but I didn't get mine.
- 'Sup, losers.
Oh!
What are you doing here, Gina?
Are you back?
Did my begging change your mind?
Nah, dog.
I'm just tying up some loose ends.
- Gina, why are you still here?
- Jeez.
What's the big deal?
It's just you made us all toasts at Gina-rama and say tearful goodbyes, but now you're still here.
I'm not back.
I'm just cleaning out my desk And I have some stuff I wanted to give to you guys.
Charles, weirdly, you're kind of the person I'm the closest to here.
Don't say why.
Because I was your brother and your lover?
Sorry, I can't control my tongue around you.
All right, well, here.
The Boyle family mother dough starter!
I'll think of you every time I handle her.
Oh, man.
You know, I never really understood the logic behind the two of us.
But I love you and I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too, Gina.
- You're getting cold feet.
I mean, why haven't you cleaned out your desk - over your last two weeks?
- Because, Terry, I was busy giving each and every one of you a beautiful GM.
- Well, not all of us.
- Oh, Terry, that reminds me.
Rosa, do you want this plant?
- Yeah.
I mess with orchids.
- Great.
Well, that about wraps up everything I meant to do.
Come on.
I wonder if Holt's gonna hire a new assistant.
Well, he can't hire someone permanent right away.
He needs a rebound assistant first.
It's gonna be so weird seeing someone at Gina's Oh.
She's still here.
- Gina, what's going on?
- Cold feet.
- She's never going to leave.
- No, I wanted to make sure Holt was familiar with my filing system.
I didn't want to leave him in the dark.
There are no dividers.
It's just a big pile of loose papers.
Okay, yeah, you get it.
I'll stick around the rest of the day in case you have any questions.
Never gonna leave!
She's definitely still gonna be here.
No way.
She's gone.
Hah!
Look!
Her desk, I told you, it's empty.
She's right over there burning stuff.
I'm just sage-ing.
Trying to clear this place of my energy.
- Why?
- Cold feet.
No.
No one's paying me for my vibes anymore.
I'm not trying to give 'em away for free.
Oh, my God.
I know what's going on.
Gina, you're having second thoughts.
You have cold feet.
I figured it out!
Jake for the win.
There you go.
- Come on, man!
- I never have second thoughts.
That's the luxury of having great first thoughts.
Gina, it's okay.
You're scared.
Tare-bear, I love you, but don't try - and hop on my thing, okay?
- But for real.
I'm not scared.
Hey, guys.
You were right.
I'm scared as hell.
Anyway.
- I'm here all day.
- Huh.
All right.
I think we need to all get on the same page for what do to about this Gina situation.
Well, we should tell her we believe in her.
- Good point, Charles.
- And we all know she'll succeed at whatever she tries.
I feel like this is all my fault.
She's staying for me.
She just can't let go.
Hitchcock, you don't have to contribute.
All right, guys, let's get in there and support the hell out of Gina.
What is that?
It's a statue of her.
Texting on her phone.
Guys, look, there's a note.
Hello, Nine-Nine.
I just wanted to thank you guys.
I was so nervous to move on and I even started to doubt myself, which is crazy.
And your kind words really helped me, - especially yours, Terry.
- Aww.
Psych!
Did he fall f Terry, did you fall for it?
Anyway, Terry, that's your Gina Moment.
Seriously?
I've known her for seven years.
JK again.
I'm really gonna miss you, Sarge.
I signed you up for an international yogurt of the month club.
Austria is in the fridge right now.
Terry's never had Austrian yogurt before.
Terry had the best moment of all.
Anyway, I didn't doubt myself for one second.
And I'm more confident than I've ever been.
I was only stalling because there was a shipping delay - with my golden statue.
- Ah, that makes sense.
And even though she looks like she has wet hair and just combed through a deep conditioning treatment, and even though her jeans look cheap and even though she has sausage fingers, I hope it reminds you of me, and I'm gonna miss you.
I'll hold now for a five minute applause break.
Do it!
Please.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
This feels right.
I love you guys.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 Peralta, looks like an old friend of yours - is back in town.
- Who?
That guy Neil that you bunked with at sleepaway camp?
Oh, Neil from camp was the best.
He could pick up a milk carton with his butt cheeks.
He was so funny.
You know who else was funny?
Bill Cosby.
Charles, will you relax?
You're gonna love Neil.
It's not Neil.
Why would it be Neil?
- It's Doug Judy.
- Oh, right.
Someone we all know in a police capacity.
That makes more sense.
Someone's using his signature move to steal cars, plugging in to the OBD port and reprogramming the immobilizer module.
That's Doug Judy's MO, but it's not him.
- He told me he went legit.
- That's what he told you last time too, before he screwed you over.
Yeah, but he returned the diamonds to me eventually, and it turned out that was the only way to get Giggle Pig off the streets.
Wait, I may be confusing our adventures.
What year was the cruise?
Dude's a criminal.
People don't change.
Ever heard of Bruce Banner, the Incredible Hulk?
You might want to talk to his shirts and pants about people not changing.
Well, I want to ask Doug Judy some questions.
- You have his number?
- I always make contact through his mom.
I'll put you in touch with her, but remember, she thinks I'm his assistant Mangy Carl, and he's a famous architect who's designing LeBron James' new school for black astronauts.
Hello, Mrs. Judy?
I'm looking for your son, the architect.
Yes, I'm from black NASA.
Is that a thing?
Oh, my.
I didn't know.
I understand.
Good-bye.
So Doug Judy will not be coming in.
What?
Why not?
Oh, I see.
He is dead.
Wow, I don't know how to deal with all these emotions, Terry.
No one I've been close with has ever died before.
No tragic accidents to friends.
All my grandparents are alive.
How did you deal when Hodor died?
Not well, Terry.
Why would you bring that up?
Carl?
Mangy Carl?
Yes.
That is me.
I'm Trudy Judy, Doug's sister.
This is our aunt Patrice.
I'm so glad you could make it.
Doug really loved you.
- Oh, he talked about me?
- Oh, all the time.
He was so afraid he'd fall back into your old life.
Doug made Mangy Carl an assistant at the architecture firm.
He rescued him from a life on the streets.
Yeah, I was down on my luck, not a penny to my name.
- You were selling your body for money.
- Did Doug tell you that?
He said all your teeth fell out, and your mouth was just a rotten hole.
100% accurate.
Plus you were sick from those back-alley butt implants.
- Had to have 'em.
- Carl thought a plumper rump would help him get his  every night.
Yeah, I remember having that thought.
But the doctor just put a bunch of mulch up there, - and it got all infected.
- Dark days.
I'm sorry.
It's just so sweet.
- The mulch thing?
- No, how Doug saved him.
Doug was always taking people under his wing.
Doug said you have a beautiful voice.
Oh, he did?
Well, I Suppose that's true Would you want to sing a song for us?
What a nice thought, but you know what, I don't have anything prepared.
Okay, well, if you don't want to sing, you could just tell us the inspiring story of how Doug saved you from being a mulch-butt ho.
I would like to sing a song in honor of my dear friend Doug Judy.
Oh, nothing better after a long shift than coming to Shaw's.
It's like Cheers, where everybody knows your name.
A place where everybody knows your name is hell.
- You're describing hell.
- Guys, guys, guys.
Are those  Firefighters.
Hey, what's going on?
Why is the FDNY in our cop bar?
We needed a new place, since our bar, O'Brien's, burned down.
- You couldn't put that out?
- They probably started it.
Most arsonists turn out to be firefighters.
That's not true, though it is very common, and definitely what happened in this case.
I'm surprised you guys even want to come here since you have to take the stairs.
I know how much you like sliding on poles.
We don't like sliding on poles.
We do it to save lives.
It's dangerous.
You can ask my best friend Steve.
Oh, no, wait, you can't, actually, because he's dead.
Tripped through a pole hole, broke his neck.
- That's horrible.
-  Sorry, but this is a firefighter bar now.
Although we might want to make some changes to the decor.
I'm thinking some old-timey pressure gauges, maybe an autographed photo of Denis Leary from "Rescue Me".
- You wouldn't.
- Wouldn't I?
Check it out.
You son of a bitch.
Doug Judy I wish you were alive, Doug Judy God will give you a high five  Doug Judy Oh, no, he gave himself a key change.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Doug Judy You're a friend, friend, friend Doug Judy!
This song is at its end Thank you so much.
You've been a great audience.
I mean, it's a funeral.
That's psychotic.
I'm so sorry.
Why are there firefighters here?
Did one of them turn out to be an arsonist - and burn down their own bar?
- Actually, yes.
So predictable.
But why did you call me?
There's nothing I can do about this.
You have gravitas.
Everyone listens to you.
Look, even if I could save Shaw's, I'm not sure I'd want to.
This place is a hovel.
The only wine they serve is from the Delaware Water Gap.
It's called "Charbonnay".
But this is our bar, and it has been forever.
Change is a good thing.
Just yesterday, you were ranting about the Philharmonic adding a second piccolo.
It's too many.
It'll muddle the sound.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Look, we can find a new bar that's not beneath us.
What about Bel Vino?
They've got a great selection of Italian reds, and your feet don't stick to the floor if you stand in one place too long.
Fine.
If you're not gonna do anything, then I will.
Hank, you got to get rid of these hose humpers.
- It's them or us.
- Look, guys, I don't want to take sides.
I just want to make money.
Then keep it a cop bar.
We drink like crazy.
Yeah, 'cause of all the tragedy we experience on a daily basis, son.
Oh, yeah?
We experience plenty of tragedy too.
We lose a man a year to the pole hole.
-  - How about this?
If it's about money, let's just have a drink-off.
Whoever racks up the biggest tab by closing time gets to keep Shaw's.
Okay, defectives.
- My guys can handle that.
- Oh, can they?
'Cause the Nine-Nine's about to bring the real heat.
Get ready for the back draft, bitch.
Jake, are you upset?
Where are you going?
Are you embarrassed about your singing?
- Doug Judy.
- What?
Hey, Jake.
Man, that song was moving AF.
We got to lay that down.
Doug Judy, he's smushing on the beach Don't try and duet with me, you bastard.
You tricked me.
Now give me a hug.
I'm so happy you're alive.
I'll never forgive you.
You're my best friend.
Whoo, I just went through a lot of emotions real fast, but I think I'm back to normal now.
- Should we get lunch?
- I would love a cheesesteak.
I was thinking the exact same thing, probably 'cause  The coffin looks like a hoagie roll.
Judy, what the hell is going on?
Uh, who are you, and where is Rosa?
I'm his boss, and I want answers.
All right.
You know who Stefano Lucas is?
The arms dealer?
I got word he put a hit out on me, so I had to disappear.
Why does Stefano Lucas want you dead?
His favorite Ferrari got stolen, and for some reason he thinks I did it.
Probably because someone's been jacking cars all over Brooklyn using your MO.
Oh, my God.
Jake, are you saying - what I think you're saying?
- Yes.
- You have a copycat.
-  I didn't think I'd accomplished enough in my career for this.
I know, it's big.
It just feels so good to be seen, you know?
Wait.
The only way to catch a copycat is to team up with the original criminal.
I'm back on the force!
Give me a gun.
No!
There is no copycat.
You did it.
Not me.
I'm living that straight life.
Terry refuses to believe it.
He thinks people can't change.
Tell that to Bruce Banner's pants and shirt.
That's what I said.
Doug Judy, you're under arrest.
What?
Sarge?
You are really bringing down the vibe at this funeral.
What the hell is that?
Jake got me this disguise so some criminal doesn't see me in here and tell Stefano.
Okay, but why is Jake also wearing them?
Uh, because it looks super cool, Sarge.
We look like the hot twins from "The Matrix".
We are getting aggravated.
- You look like Milli Vanilli.
- Ooh!
I call Vanilli.
Ah, I want to be Nilli, but you got it.
- He's the best one.
- You know it's true.
So did you check out Judy's alibi?
Yes, and surprisingly, it checks out.
Last Saturday night, Doug was deejaying Joshy Greenbaum's bar mitzvah.
That was a wild party.
Auntie Karen is a freak.
Judy, you deejay bar mitzvahs?
Best gig I ever had.
No one likes hip-hop more than a 13-year-old Jewish boy.
- Mm.
So true.
- I'm not buying it.
Probably stealing cash off the gift table.
Sarge, come on.
He has an alibi.
Let's just team up and try and catch the copycat.
A thousand push-ups.
It's something Rosa and I used to say.
It just means trust me.
If Judy's a criminal, I'll do a thousand push-ups, and since you're so confident, if you're wrong, you can do 'em.
And a thousand push-ups?
That's a lot to you?
You go to hell, Terry.
Make it 100,000 push-ups, and I'm in.
Obviously I can't do that much exercise, but it doesn't matter, because Doug Judy is telling the truth, - right, Judy?
- I got you, baby.
So fine.
100,000 push-ups.
You happy, Sarge?
- Great.
Now, Doug - You never call me Doug.
Yeah, well, you called me Jake earlier.
I thought we were switching to first names.
I was thinking the same exact thing!
I was like, "Why not call him Jake"?
- We're bonding, man.
- 'Cause he's so official.
But it's chill now.
- So, Doug - Yes, Jake?
Now that we know the copycat is using your playbook, if you were still in the game which you're not, we all agree what would your next move be?
It's fight night at Barclays.
No sport attracts more ultra-wealthy people with super-nice cars than boxing.
Really?
What about the sport of hunting man?
- You got me.
- That's not a thing.
Right.
So should we just start at Barclays then?
Great.
But first, we got to make a quick little pit stop on the way.
What?
Where?
Okay, here are the rules to the contest.
If you order a drink, it must be fully consumed before you order another.
Each team's tab will be tracked on that board.
We don't want anyone getting alcohol poisoning, so if you throw up, you're disqualified.
I never throw up.
I just tell my stomach to deal with it.
My body is terrified of me.
Guys, there's no way we can win.
There's nine of them and six of us.
Five of you.
I'm going home.
Although perhaps I'll stop at Bel Vino on the way, have a glass of Sancerre.
Might even try the quince paste if I'm feeling naughty.
You're really gonna let these firefighters take Shaw's from us?
Think of all the celebrations we've had here, all the times Terry has yelled "Nine-Nine"!
I hate it when he says that.
He should say, "Cheers to the Ninety-Ninth Precinct"!
We shouldn't be here.
If you're worried that someone will recognize me and find out I'm still alive, they won't.
There's not too many hardened criminals at Justin Friedman's bar mitzvah.
Although there is a murderer on the loose, 'cause Kevin Goldman is killing those dance moves!
Get it, Kevin!
That's the floss.
He's flossing.
It's just that we should be at Barclays already.
The fights are starting soon.
Rich guys never show up on time.
Besides, I promised Justin I'd be here.
What up, J-Smooth!
Gone straight, my ass.
I got you, Doug Judy.
- Huh?
- What are you talking about?
Something felt wrong, stopping for this bar mitzvah, so I sent some plainclothes officers to watch the lots at Barclays.
- They just caught the copycat.
- I don't understand.
If anything, that proves Judy's innocent.
He's been standing here with us the whole time.
Which was his plan!
Establish an alibi, so his partner can go off stealing cars.
I don't have a partner.
Whoever this is, I promise you, I do not know him.
Actually, Doug, I think you do.
Oh, my God.
Trudy Judy!
You still want to pretend you had nothing to do with this?
I didn't, and she didn't either.
Trudy Judy's not a car thief.
Trudy Judy's an angel.
She's putting herself through nursing school.
And nurses are the best of our society.
Name one bad nurse.
Nurse Ratched.
Kathy Bates in "Misery".
Nurse Jackie had a pill problem.
Okay, damn, you got a lot of real good examples off the top of your head.
You believe me, right, Jake?
I mean, the fact pattern's not great, but Trudy did seem very nice when I met her.
You trying to get your freak on with my sister?
What?
No.
I see you looking at Trudy Judy's booty.
I am not looking at Trudy Judy's booty.
Oh, you don't think she's a cutie?
- Don't be snooty.
- She's a beauty, - but I'm on duty.
- And you're married.
Well, yeah, but that doesn't rhyme.
Sorry, I just get so overprotective.
She's such a good kid.
I guarantee you, she didn't steal those cars.
We caught her sitting in a Bentley with a power amplifier and a homemade override plugged into the CAN bus.
Yeah, she guilty.
I can't believe you made us think you were dead.
I can't believe you're out here stealing cars.
- That's for lowlifes.
- You steal cars.
And I'm a lowlife.
A gorgeous, charming, super smart lowlife beloved by all.
I'm sorry, Dougie.
I was falling behind on my student loans.
I had to do something.
Guys, if you weren't working together, how did she know all your signature moves?
I found some of Doug's old notebooks.
Those are notes for my memoir.
Memoir?
Do you have title ideas yet?
I was just gonna call it "The Pontiac Bandit" - Oh, is that it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- I hated stealing cars.
I was gonna stop as soon as nursing school was paid off, I swear.
It was a mistake.
That's good enough for me.
Come on, Trudy, let's go home.
That's not really how arresting works.
- She's going to jail.
- Wait, wait, wait.
What if we get you a bigger fish?
- What if we can get you Stefano?
- Who?
That cherry red 1961 Ferrari 250GT California you took belongs to a guy named Stefano Lucas.
He thinks I did it, and now he wants to kill me.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
It's all good.
You have the car, so I call him, tell him I'm not dead, say I want to give him his car back, arrange a drop, and these guys take him down or die trying.
That is interesting.
Stefano almost never comes out in public.
It would be a huge collar for the Nine-Nine.
What do you say, Sarge?
100,000 push-ups?
Fine.
If you deliver Stefano, I'll talk to the DA about a reduced sentence for your sister.
Thank you so much.
There's just one problem.
I don't have the car.
I already handed it off to a fence.
Oh, Judy, Judy, you screwed me.
Four hours left.
We're down $58.
- Amy, where you at?
- Four drinks.
- What's four-drink Amy again?
- Why don't you come over here - and find out?
- Right, Horny Amy.
It feels like you should retire that one for the MeToo era.
Why don't you come over here and make me?
All right, there's only one thing left to do.
Drink faster.
Set a bunch of fires throughout the city.
- Mine's better.
- No!
We can do this.
Things seem bleak now, but the night is always darkest before the dawn.
This is Shaw's.
We've had weddings here, and funerals.
Shaw's is part of our family, because that is what we are.
A family.
And we're not just Amy and Rosa and Hitchcock and   So the fence, Dallas, he works in there.
I don't like him.
My rule?
Never trust anyone named after a city.
- What about Orlando Bloom?
- I never thought about him being named after the city before, and his last name is Bloom?
Wait a minute.
Did we just realize something crazy?
No, everyone knows it's a crazy name.
Now can we just focus on the meet-up?
- Fine.
- All right, Dallas is creepy and paranoid, and he really freaked me out that last time.
- I don't want to go in alone.
- Don't worry, kid.
I'll be there right next to you, as always.
Aw.
Sarge, why don't you say stuff like that to me?
No, look, I do not trust the Judys going anywhere alone.
Doug, you stay with Jake.
I'll go in with Trudy.
I just need a cover story.
We could say that you're my boyfriend.
No.
No, no, no, I don't want my little sister fake-dating some pervert.
What?
Why am I a pervert?
Uh, have you ever met a nice, normal guy that wears suspenders every day?
What kind of person has to tie their pants down to keep them from flying off?
That's not what suspenders are for, man.
Guys, we don't have time to figure out what suspenders are for, all right?
Now, Trudy, this is undercover work.
It can be very intense.
Are you sure you can handle it?
I mean, I'll do my best.
- Who's this?
- This is Deion.
He's my man.
Ask me another question, you simple little barn animal.
Okay, so she can handle it.
Why is your boyfriend here?
Who said boyfriend?
Deion and I freak, then he shuts his pretty little mouth and lets me handle my business.
I don't like the direction this is going.
Easy.
She's just playing a part.
Pretty big age difference here.
- Where'd you guys meet?
- The club.
Deion was a bouncer, and I told him I wanted him to bounce on me.
-  - Oh, what is that?
Is she rubbing on his mic?
The mic that was taped to his chest?
You should feel these.
They're like two baseball bases.
Make 'em pop, daddy.
Daddy's not sure this is the time.
Do it, daddy!
Ooh, ow!
Ooh, ow!
Get your hands off her, pervert!
Judy!
Judy!
I tried to stop him.
That's my baby sister you're caressing.
What?
How can I caress her with my pecs?
Look at those things.
They got thumbs.
Guys, guys, stop!
Where is Dallas?
I think he got spooked and ran away.
Good job, Doug Judy.
You just cost your sister a chance at a reduced sentence.
Oh, no!
Why is my tone so playful?
Why is there a twinkle in my eye?
Because I just found our 1961 Ferrari 250GT California.
Oh, ho, ho!
Ladies and gents and pervert Terry, we are in business.
Sorry, Sarge, I got caught up in the moment there.
- - Guys, I threw up.
Oh, man, it's over.
- We need a miracle.
- I'm here.
Captain Holt!
How are you here?
You called me.
You didn't stop calling me.
I didn't call you.
Look.
You left 17 voicemails.
Here's one.
Holt!
You got to come save us.
We need a lie to get you here.
Charles, what should I say?
That I got shot in the face.
Ooh, and tell him to bring pizza.
Whoo!
Crampon Holt!
We're losing.
- Yeah!
- Why are you dancing?
Oh, I was up to nine-drink Amy, who speaks French, and then I hurl I hurl hurled.
What she's trying to say is that she vomited, and now she's back down to three-drink Amy, or Amy Dance Pants.
You know it.
My God.
Hitchcock, are you the only person still making sense?
Yeah.
It's bad.
So are you gonna make us give up, Clappin?
Or are you here to tell us to stop?
No, I'm here to help you win.
What is happening?
Why is this?
It's something you said on one of your voicemails, after you had sung the entirety of a song called "Shake Whatcha Mama Gave Ya".
You thought you had hung up, but you hadn't.
Anyway, bye-bye.
What am I doing calling him?
He doesn't care about us or what we want.
When I heard that, I was shaken to my core.
I thought this bar was beneath me, but what was actually beneath me was my own behavior.
- I had turned my back on - Holt!
We do not have time for this.
Just drinky, drinky!
Hank, bring me a Charbonnay.
All right, Stefano should be here any minute.
I just want to thank you guys so much for helping me.
I don't deserve your kindness.
Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.
We all make bad decisions when we're younger.
- I was once in a flash mob.
- Ew.
Something's off about this.
I don't like leaving Judy out there alone.
Relax, we have a tracker on the car, a tracker on Doug Judy, and ESU has the entire area surrounded.
- It's gonna be fine.
- We got movement.
Okay, everyone, to your positions.
On my signal.
Hold.
Hold.
Hold.
Sorry, I started holding too soon.
Let's start over.
Hold.
Hold.
And  Everyone, stop holding!
Go, go, go, go!
Where is he?
Where is he?
Got him.
They got Stefano.
No, not Stefano.
The Pontiac Bandit.
- Where is - Doug Judy here.
Y'all see that car blow up?
Yeah, we did.
Why did you do that?
You think I did that?
Doug Judy does not work with fire.
Yeah, he's like the Hound from "Game of Thrones".
I am like the Hound.
And you're my Arya.
- Right?
- Guys!
If Doug Judy didn't blow up the car, who did?
Trudy Judy.
Damn, sir, you took that Charbonnay to the house.
- How you feeling?
- Let me take stock.
My equilibrium is askew, my vision is partially impaired, and I'm clearly slurring my words.
To put a fine point on it, your boy is turnt.
Well, well, well, there's only a minute left, and you are six bucks down.
I don't think you guys are gonna make it.
Hank, another Charb.
This one's hot.
It was sitting on the radiator.
- He's never gonna make it.
- Yes, he will.
Just don't breathe.
Let the liquid into your lungs.
Five, four, three, two Closing time!
Cops win!
All right, fine, the bar is yours.
But we're keeping this!
Come on.
Before we all go home and pass out, I want to say how sorry I am that I deserted you earlier.
I want you to know that I care about you all so very much, each and every one of you.
Boyle, Santiago, Diaz, Hitchcock, Scu  All right, I have officers looking for her.
She was on foot.
She couldn't have gone far.
-  - This is her.
- Where are you, Trudy?
- In the wind, Dougie.
Okay, that's a cool thing to say, but what are you doing?
They were gonna reduce your charges.
Reduced charges are still charges, and I can't go to prison.
There are no dudes there, and I need to smush!
- Trudy!
- Oh, grow up, Doug.
I'm an adult woman who's horny all the time.
- What is going on?
- Oh, are you judging me, ho?
Trudy, running from the cops is a felony.
That means no more nursing school.
Good.
It sucked.
I only went to, like, one class.
- What?
- It was boring as hell.
So then I started running Internet scams.
Then there was identity theft.
I was Queen Latifah for a bit.
Then Lil' Kim.
That was less believable.
But then I found your old notebooks.
How come you never told me how much fun car thieving is?
Because I didn't want you to fall in love with it.
Wait, I'm confused.
When did you put the bomb in the Ferrari?
I didn't do it.
Dallas did.
And Dallas isn't some criminal I'm afraid of.
He's my employee.
Say what's up, Dallas.
- Wassup?
- Named after a city.
The hard part was trying to figure out how to tell him my plan, so then I came up with that whole boyfriend thing, because I needed a distraction.
I knew you'd rush in, all weird and old-fashioned, try to protect my honor.
How can I caress her with my pecs?
Look at those things.
They got thumbs.
I don't need you to protect me, Doug.
You're my baby sister.
I got to look out for you.
That's so sweet, and also dumb.
I'll see you at Christmas, sucker!
I love you, big bro.
Trudy!
Man, I am gutted.
This is awful.
Is this how you feel every time I trick you?
Pretty much.
Yeah, it always hurts.
Wow, I'm sorry, man.
It must be really hard to hang out with me.
Well, it's a tough relationship, but it's exciting.
Hey, Doug, I'm sorry for not trusting you.
Turns out you had nothing to do with this.
Oh, so you admit people can change.
Yes.
Bruce Banner's pants and shirt were correct.
You know what this means, right?
6,203.
6,204.
I am so glad I lost this bet.
I never find time for things I enjoy.
This is so unsatisfying.
You're not even sweating.
It's too easy.
Get on my back, Jake.
- No, I'm not - Get on my back, Jake!
Coming, strong man!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 -  -  -  - Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
- The coffee guy was - Assaulting your head?
- What is going on up there?
- Is it bad?
Before I answer that question, do you currently have a knife on you?
- Yeah, several.
- Then I love it.
It really is hair.
It's bad, Rosa.
You look like Edna from "The Incredibles".
I'm sorry, don't stab me.
My girlfriend Jocelyn's been practicing a bunch of different hairstyles on me.
She's in cosmetology school.
- Is she passing?
- Honestly, I don't know.
Well, let's get into this murder.
I'm hoping it's a dope one.
Mamma Mia.
That's a bloody pizza pie.
-  - No, it's okay.
I can say that.
I'm half Italian.
That's not the problem I had with it.
Detectives.
The vacuum was running when we got here.
Smeared blood across the entire apartment.
Is this dope enough for you?
I mean, it's a bloody robot, Rosa.
It's clearly a good start, but it's gonna take more than that to be certified as dope.
- Who's the Vic?
- Name is Andrew Adams.
- Kind of a boring name.
Not dope.
- He's an investigative reporter.
- Dope.
What was he investigating?
- Chicken farming.
Sharp turn away from dopeness, but who found the body?
His boss called the cops when he didn't show up to work, so he was found by Officer Darrell.
Officer Darrell?
You are seriously undoping this.
You got anything else for me?
Jen?
The apartment was locked from the inside.
Mysterious.
Dope.
And the alarm system was still armed.
Dope, dope, dope, dope.
So hard to solve.
- Any surveillance cameras?
- Oh, yeah.
- Tons of 'em.
We checked 'em.
- It's too easy.
But no one was seen going in or out.
So whoever did this was a ghost.
Yes!
A ghost!
Oh!
I officially declare this case dope!
Whoo!
I love the first walkthrough of a crime scene.
It's kind of like arriving at summer camp, except the lake is full of blood and your bunk mate is dead.
I think I might be bad at metaphors.
So after Adams comes home from work, the only person who even approaches his doorway is this delivery guy?
Yeah, but he never enters the apartment.
Hey, Rosa.
Check it out.
Triple digies!
There's so much evidence, we hit triple digies.
- Cool.
- Cool indeed.
But you know what's not cool?
Our Vic ordered his dinner from House of Lettuce.
There's no way this guy knew he was gonna die.
No one would want lettuce as their last meal.
For example, my last meal is gon'st to be Sour Straws.
- You just keep those in your pocket?
- We face death every day.
I gotta be prepared to go out on my own terms.
I can't even think about eating.
Smells like the brim of Scully's hat in here.
That's the heat wave.
It sped up body decomp.
I guess you could say this mystery is straight outta decomp ton.
- No.
Who are you?
- I'm Franco McCoy.
I'm running CSI and forensics.
You two must be detectives.
I can tell because you look pretty buttoned up.
We're both wearing leather jackets.
And I won this hoodie for eating a big pizza.
Just do me a favor.
Don't turn into a star humper around me or my squad, because they make TV shows about us sometimes.
What?
They make shows about us all the time.
- Name one.
- "Law and Order".
- Never heard of it.
- "NYPD Blue".
- Nope.
- "Miami Vice".
- Nah.
- "Hill Street Blues".
- Pass.
- "The Wire".
- Sounds dumb.
- "Rizzoli & Isles".
Okay.
That's a good one.
All right, if the heat is causing the smell, why don't we just turn on the air conditioning Whoa, whoa, whoa!
That kind of air flow is gonna kick up all kinds of dust particles.
That AC stays off, which means the odor in here?
Only gonna get worse.
Pro tip: plug your noses.
Had this little bad boy custom-made 3-D printed to fit these sweet nosters.
Are you trying to abbreviate "nostrils"?
In CSI, we don't try.
We do, son.
Okay.
Well, it's been sort of okay meeting you.
We're gonna turn our backs and ignore you now.
Hey, Jake.
You know what it's time for?
I sure do.
Jake and Rosa's first impressions.
Cast-off pattern on the far wall suggests upward knife slices.
Jake?
Wounds on the vic's back means he didn't see the killer coming.
Rosa?
Laptop, wallet, keys all in plain sight.
No sign of forced entry.
Doesn't connote a robbery.
Jake?
But it does connote that our killer was waiting for Adams in the apartment.
Did I just use the word "connote" correctly?
- You did.
- Great.
Will you text that to Amy?
I don't want to say what using good vocabulary gets me.
- Okay.
- Sexual intercourse.
- Gross.
- What?
We're adults.
I'm his mother!
Let me in!
Rock-paper-scissors for who has to talk to the vic's mom.
Deal.
It's a game of chance.
How do you always win?
You always pick paper.
That is not true.
Here, go again.
One more time.
All right, one more time.
One more time.
One more time.
One more time.
All right, one more time.
One more time.
God, this reverse psychology is a bust!
Ma'am?
I'm Detective Peralta.
This is Detective Diaz.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Please tell me whatever you can.
Nobody will tell me anything.
I really wish that I could, but we're just starting our investigation.
Now, is there anyone you can think of that would want to hurt your son?
No!
Everybody loved Andrew.
I don't know why this happened!
Please, you have to find who did this.
We're doing everything we can.
Promise me you'll find who did this.
- Ma'am, we can't promise - Promise me!
Andrew was my whole world.
I'm a single mom.
- I promise you.
- Wow.
You really are an idiot.
Um, exsqueeze me?
Did you really just promise a victim's family member we would solve a crime?
Oh, come on.
I was just consoling her.
No.
It was a full-on promise, and it wasn't just her.
-  - Yes, Betty.
I promise I will find your friend's son's killer.
Yes, you can put your husband on.
I'll promise him too.
Okay, well, what's his number at work, then?
- Do you have a pen?
-  You broke the number one rule of dealing with a victim's family member.
- What were you thinking?
- I don't know.
She reminded me of my mom, okay?
A single mother crying in the hallway?
Those are some of my best childhood memories.
- Jake.
- What, is that bad?
Dude, you never make a promise, because if we don't solve this, you've given her false hope, and that is way worse.
Normally, I would totally agree with you, but we're going to solve this case.
We have so much evidence.
We hit triple digies!
We'll interview his friends and neighbors and coworkers.
Come on.
We got this!
- We're Jake and Rosa!
- And also Franco.
You're not a part of this, Franco.
Your loss.
My goodness.
Did Mother Gothel finally let you out of the tower to see the lanterns that fly for your birthday?
- What?
- It was a "Tangled" burn.
Charles and I watched it for bros night.
Cool.
No, Jocelyn's learning how to weave in hair extensions.
She wanted me to look nice 'cause I'm meeting her parents tonight.
Wow.
Moving fast.
Meetin' each other's parents.
Yeah.
Well, I'm meeting hers.
I still haven't talked to my mom since coming out, so it's kind of a bummer.
I don't really want to talk about this.
Can we find a segue?
What?
You can't just say "let's find a segue".
- I just did.
- Okay.
I talked to the neighbors.
Our Vic had a party three nights before the murder.
I talked to everyone on the guest list.
They all have alibis, so I got nothing.
- How did your interviews go?
- Not great.
I talked to his coworkers, friends, and family.
No one had a motive.
Everyone loved him.
The dumb jerk.
RIP.
Did you promise any of them that you'd find the killer?
Yes, his aunt.
She also reminded me of my mom.
Her name was Karen!
- Jake!
- Look, it's gonna be fine.
This apartment is full of forensic evidence.
There is no way that CSI hasn't found something.
I have never been more confident in my entire  I can taste the smell.
Ugh.
You shouldn't be able to taste smells.
That's the heat cookin' the blood rot right out of the floorboards.
Set scent to simmer.
Serve over rice.
Well I hated that.
Just so you know, Franco, we're not responding positively to you as a person.
Yeah.
Maybe just give us an update on the labs.
Copy that.
The victim was stabbed 30 times.
Coroner puts time of death between 6:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Sunday night.
Okay, and how many DNA matches did you find?
- None.
- What about hair?
- Zero.
- Fingerprints?
Zilcharoni.
I have no matches of anything on any criminal databases whatsoever.
Still feeling good about your promise, Jake?
Still feeling good about that haircut, Cousin It?
Franco, how did you guys not find anything?
You had 15 people in here.
First of all, you sound so ignorant right now.
I had 14 guys here.
Like I'd ever get approval for 15 guys.
That's insane.
Second of all, don't worry, Detective Kitty Cat.
I got one droplet of milk nestled at the top of CSI's teat, so pucker up.
Just talk normal.
We tested the blood.
This splatter here belongs to the victim, this to a second individual, and that to a third.
Oh, hells, yes.
We might have some perp blood in here.
This is huge!
Rosa, we are gonna solve this case.
- What're you doing?
- Texting my mom.
I mean, the vic's mom.
I know that it's bad that I said "my mom".
It's bad that you're texting her.
I know!
- - Ah.
Good morning, Rosa.
I see you're still going out with Edward Scissorhands.
You seem particularly chipper this morning.
Indeed I am, because I finally tracked down the guy who delivered our Vic his final meal and, in so doing, maybe saw the other two guys who bled all over this apartment.
We don't know there were three people in this apartment.
Peralta.
Diaz.
Special delivery.
Delivery guy.
Wow, Franco, you're really getting lazy.
- You're lazy.
- Even lazier.
Hello, sir.
We'd like to ask you a couple of questions.
Okay, look, I ate a couple fries out of the bag, but everybody does that.
- That's not why you're here.
- Oh, snap.
- Is this about weed?
- Should it be?
No?
You delivered food to the guy in this apartment at 6:40 p.m. on Sunday, and within the hour, he was murdered.
- What?
How?
That's horrible!
- Don't worry.
We're definitely gonna catch the guy who did it, I promise.
- Stop promising people.
- Not.
Did you see anything suspicious?
No.
But I didn't go inside.
The guy came to the door.
I just gave him the food.
And did you see or hear anyone else in the apartment?
No, just that one guy.
He ordered, uh, three beetroot zucchini wraps.
Three.
Three disgusting wraps.
Three disgusting bloodstains.
I knew it.
There were three people in there.
Will you be willing to go inside and let us know if anything looks different to you?
Yeah.
Sure, that's fine.
I don't care.
Why would you show this to me?
Oh, I'm too high to see this.
There's blood on the fish!
On the fish!
I always forget how weirdly numb to horrific things we are.
Do you think it affects our souls and the relationships we build with others?
- Oh, for sure.
- Oh.
You must have seen something.
You delivered the food at 6:40, and sometime before 7:30, Adams was stabbed to death.
Stop saying "stabbed"!
What I saw in there forever changed me.
My heart is still pounding.
Wait.
Adams was wearing a smart watch, right?
Those things track your heart rate.
If we look at his phone, we can see the exact moment that his heart stopped beating.
Here we go.
Activities app.
And boom.
His heart rate dropped to zero at exactly 6:03.
The food wasn't even ordered until 6:16, which means  The killer ordered the food!
Oh, God.
Did I talk to a murderer?
Jake, this guy saw the perp.
We have to get him in front of a sketch artist.
Oh, yeah.
I'm feeling it now, Rosa.
At this time tomorrow, we're gonna know exactly what our killer looks like.
We have no idea what our killer looks like.
Well, that's not totally true.
We now know that the killer might look like Seth Myers, Winona Ryder, or Bilbo Baggins.
The delivery guy kept starting over.
Apparently, he's always high.
I'm sorry, man.
Our big break turned into nothing.
- Detectives.
- Ah!
Captain.
Did you come down here to take a look at the two best detectives you've ever worked with in action?
The two best detectives I've ever worked with are Montez and Dillman.
- Oh.
You never mentioned them before.
- They were excellent.
I'm here because Major Crimes wants this case.
I was hoping to tell them you have some leads.
I overheard you mention a Bill Bo-Baggins.
Should we bring him in?
Well, as much as I would love to meet him, he is not a suspect.
- Okay, so who is?
- At this time?
No one.
But we are currently investigating no leads.
- So you have nothing.
- Not nothing.
Jake made a new best friend.
The vic's mom.
He promised her he'd solve the case.
- That's a rookie mistake.
- Okay.
Fine.
So maybe I'm not Montana and Dilbert.
Montez and Dillman!
And they would've remembered your name after one mention.
Because we're memorable, and they're not.
Turned it around.
- Nope.
- All right, look, Captain.
Rosa and I are gonna solve this case.
The answer is in this room.
We just have to focus and let the room speak to us, isn't that right, room?
When you talk to the room, I lose even more confidence in you.
Why?
Oh, wait, I see it.
All right.
Can you please just buy us some more time anyway?
Sir, I feel like we've earned this.
- Fine.
Work fast.
- You got it.
Okay.
Let's look at the scene like we're seeing it for the first time with fresh eyes.
Vic was face down.
Cast-off splatter suggests upward knife slices.
No signs of forced entry.
Laptop, wallet, keys were all there.
Doesn't connote a robbery.
Wait a minute.
Have we said this already?
Are we just having the exact same conversation?
- Yep.
- Cool.
Moving on.
Windows and doors locked from the inside.
Nobody in or out.
Think, think, think oh!
The upstairs neighbor and his best friend drilled through the ceiling, murdered Adams, bleed all over the apartment, then climbed back up and sealed the hole behind them!
Negative, we would have found construction debris and microscopic paint fibers.
The only thing that needs patching is that theory.
Okay.
New idea.
We're gonna get inside the mind of the killer.
We eat the veggie wraps.
Here we go.
Oh, this sick bastard.
Oh, man.
This is one twisted mother.
Oh, the beets are raw.
This guy is demented, Rosa!
Okay.
All we have to do is figure out what kind of person can walk by cameras without being seen.
- Someone camouflaged as a wall.
- Unlikely.
Harry Potter and his invisibility cloak.
- Not a real person.
- Babadook.
- Doesn't exist.
- What about a Looper situation?
- It's not a Looper situation.
- It could totally be a Looper situation!
- It's not a Looper situation.
- This is my least favorite hair!
Oh, my God, Rosa, come here.
Look at the blood spatter.
- Do you see what I see?
- Uh, blood.
In the exact shape of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
Pec, pec, delt, delt.
Big Samoan tattoo.
Rosa.
I think I just made a connection.
The number three is everywhere.
Three people.
Three types of blood.
And guess what the tax was on the veggie wraps?
Three dollars.
And 19Â¢, but if you ignore the 19, then it's three!
- Okay.
You've lost your mind.
- What?
Who told you that?
- Was it room?
- No.
It's the fact that you think the room has a voice and also you're working in your boxers!
To beat the heat, Rosa!
To beat the heat!
If we can't turn on the AC, that's not crazy, it's just smart.
Jake.
I gave the case to Major Crimes.
What?
You can't do that.
I promised Luan!
Yeah, and now you can't let it go.
The scene's yours, guys.
I'm sorry, Jake.
It's over.
Okay, Rosa, fine!
I'll leave.
Come on, room!
- You left your pants.
- I don't care!
- Hey, Jake.
- Ah!
Hello, Rosa, my coworker and friend.
Look, I know you're mad at me, but I only gave away that case to help you.
You were acting like a lunatic.
Don't even worry about it.
You were totally right.
I was in way too deep, and honestly, I feel so free not having to work that case anymore, so thank you.
Cool, you're welcome.
What's up with all the ketchup?
Thank you for asking, Rosa.
It's for my hot dog.
Anyways, this has been a great chat, but I better get back to my hot dog.
- Oh, wow.
- Ah!
Hey!
Rosa, guess what?
There was no hot dog.
Who's the lunatic now?
- Still you, Jake.
- Yeah, right!
There's nothing crazy about this, sister.
It's the crime scene: stove, kitchen island, blood, and of course, the body.
Hi, Rosa.
I'm the body.
Shh.
Stay in character!
- Roger that.
- Let's get that blood on you.
You gave away my case, but guess what?
I spent two months in that apartment.
I can recreate it in my sleep.
- Have you slept?
- No.
What the hell is going on in here?
Jake's gone insane because he promised the victim's mom he'd solve her son's murder.
Seriously?
You never promise a victim's relative anything.
Oh, please.
Classic Terry.
Mr. Emotionless.
Sgt.
Cold Heart.
The man who bleeds ice.
I don't think that rings true.
- No?
- Clean it up and get out.
You've lost your mind.
What?
That's not true!
Charles, tell him.
Well, actually, he does have a point.
Really?
Oh, man, wow.
I guess it really does take your closest friends to make you realize that you have crap friends that are idiots and are dumb and idiots!
I'm solving this.
Hey, we heard there's a hot dog in here.
No.
Jake lied for no reason.
That son of a bitch!
- Oh, hey, babe.
-   Ugh!
It's me, Jake!
I'm just working!
What is wrong with you?
What are you doing?
Why do you have a knife?
Why am I covered in red Post-its?
That's blood.
You're the corpse.
Jake, who is that?
Franco McCoy.
CSI.
He's helping me with the case.
For the record, I think it's weird that I'm here too.
Both of you, get out!
Yeah, sounds good.
Sorry to wake you.
Sweet dreams.
Come on.
Okay, so, no one went in, no one came out.
The lab confirmed that the surveillance footage wasn't tampered with.
So what happened in there, Olive Rosa?
- I don't know.
- Ah!
You can talk.
Oh.
Rosa.
It's just you.
I thought I was really going crazy for a second there.
It was just person Rosa.
You look like crap.
You look like a freshman at an all-women's college.
I don't think you're in a position to be offering criticism right now.
More than fair.
I'm worried about you, man.
Yeah.
I can't figure it out.
- Then you gotta let it go.
- I can't do that either.
Look, I know you want to help this woman, but there are other cases.
There are other people that need your help, and right now, you're not helping anyone.
You gotta tell her it's over.
I don't know if I can do that.
Then I'll go with you.
I forced you to be there when I came out to my parents.
I owe you.
All right.
We've exhausted every lead, we have checked every alibi, and we have followed every last piece of forensics, so I guess what I'm trying to say is I can't find your son's killer.
I understand.
Thank you for trying as hard as you did.
I really hoped you'd find him.
Well, don't lose hope, because Major Crimes is on the case as we speak, and they're very Oh, they already contacted me.
Because it's been so long without any new leads, they've labeled it a cold case.
They said I shouldn't hold out hope.
I'm sorry.
It's not you.
I just can't stop feeling guilty.
Andrew and I were not on the best of terms.
We had this huge fight, and we hadn't spoken in almost a year.
I just wish I could've made it right when I had the chance.
I'm very sorry to hear that, but I'm sure - We're gonna find your son's killer.
- What?
Jake and I are jumping back on the case.
We'll make sure your son gets the justice he deserves.
I promise.
Thank you.
Rosa?
She just reminds me of my mom.
Oh, boy.
So, we gonna talk about what happened back there?
I haven't seen someone cry that much since Charles heard they were remaking "First Wives Club".
It sort of bothers me that my mom hasn't talked to me since I came out.
Why don't you just give her a call?
Because I shouldn't have to.
It's her issue, not mine.
I mean, I'm glad I came out to her, it's just, it's taking her way longer to come around than I thought it would.
It sucks.
That's weird.
The police tape's already gone.
Oh, yeah, Major Crimes released the scene yesterday.
But I'm sure they haven't had time to clean up the evidence Oh, man, they emptied the place out.
Nothing left in here.
I can't believe this is how it ends.
Yeah.
Is it weird that I miss the smell?
Wait a minute, do you hear that?
I've spent 600 hours in this room, and I have never heard that sound.
It's because the air conditioning's never been turned on.
It's coming from that vent.
I don't see anything.
Wait, there's a bend.
Oh, my God.
There's food and water in here!
Rosa.
We never saw the killer leave this apartment because he never left.
But he couldn't have survived in there for months.
That's insane.
He wasn't back there for months.
He just waited for the body to be discovered and then snuck out sometime after that.
But this place was crawling with cops.
Which is exactly what he wanted.
He snuck out dressed like a cop.
Even if he had a uniform, somebody would've recognized him.
- Not if his face was covered.
- By a Hazmat suit.
The CSI guys!
Franco said he had 14 techs, but didn't you count 15?
I did count 15!
My math was right!
Suck it, Mrs. Skanga!
She was my Algebra II teacher.
She threw a protractor at my head.
- She sucks.
- She sucked!
Actually, she was very sweet.
She believed in me.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Here's the security footage.
It's rated G for Gonna Get Got.
Less is more, Franco.
Play the tape.
Okay, so there's us arriving.
Oh, man, is that how I walk?
- Yes.
- Should I change how I walk?
- Yes.
- All right.
Wait.
Go back.
Jake, we don't have time to fix your walk.
It's gonna take a lot of work, and we're very busy.
No.
Look.
Look at this guy.
All the other techs are wearing booties, but he's not.
Follow that guy.
Where's the footage from the bodega across the street?
We have that?
That is so crazy.
We are under surveillance at all times.
I'm sure it's fine and it won't backfire and ruin society.
Zoom in on his face.
That man's not CSI.
No, Franco.
But he is about to say CS-Bye.
Yeah-ow!
Respect, Jake.
Respect.
Okay, Rosa.
- You know what it's time for.
- I do.
Jake and Rosa's final impressions.
Your client's a hit man.
He snuck into the apartment during a party several nights earlier, hid in the vent for three days, then emerged and murdered Adams.
Jake?
He then spilled bags of blood that he stole from a blood bank all over the floor and turned on the victim's vacuum cleaner to make the crime scene as messy as possible.
Rosa?
The messy scene meant there'd be extra crime techs, allowing your client to sneak out in a Hazmat suit, which records show he bought online.
Two weeks before the crime was committed.
My only question is, who was behind all this?
I was hired by a chicken farmer.
Okay.
Dopeness taking a late hit here, but we still got you.
See you at the sentencing, peace, and we're out.
He's pleading guilty.
Oh, thank God.
But why did he kill Andrew?
- Was he doing something bad?
- Not at all.
He was about to publish an exposÃ© on a large-scale poultry farm whose owner was bribing an FDA regulator.
He put a hit out on your son.
Well, is anybody going after him?
If they're not, then I will.
I promise you.
- Come here.
- Oh.
Why are you promising her?
I can't help myself!
Good-bye, detectives.
Take care.
I gotta say, we would not have solved that case if you hadn't gotten involved emotionally.
Think we'd be better cops if we did that all the time?
- Absolutely not, never again.
- Yeah, it was a total nightmare.
You want to get a celebratory drink?
I would, but I'm actually meeting somebody.
Is it Jocelyn?
Do I get to meet Jocelyn?
Oh, God, is she gonna try and cut my hair?
No.
It's my mom.
I waited too long for her to come around and call me, so I called her.
That is so great.
Oh, no.
Is she meeting you here?
Am I about to get caught in the middle of all your weird awkwardness again?
- Hello, Jake.
- Ah!
Hello, Mrs. Diaz!
America's favorite mother!
So?
So.
So Rosa's bi.
Yes, Jake, I remember.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool - You don't have to stay, man.
- Great.
Thanks.
It's really good to see you, Rosalita.
It's good to see you too.
- What did you do to your hair?
- Mom!
No, no, no, it's very cute, mija.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1  Another cold brew?
Don't mind if I "cold do".
Nailed it.
I am loving this machine that Charles brought in.
It is nice.
The trick is to let the coffee warm up to room temperature.
I'm already on my second cup.
This is my third.
Stop!
You're drinking too much!
Whoa, what's going on, Charles?
Why are you talking so slow?
I'm not.
I'm normal.
We're all normal.
If you're not going slow, that means we're going fast.
Are we going fast?
Can anyone tell if we're going fast?
I don't think we're going fast at all in any way whatsoever.
I feel like we're going slow in every way whatsoever.
- Captain, how do you feel?
- Great.
Excellent.
Amazing.
I feel better than I've ever felt at any moment - in my entire life.
- So we're all fine?
Yep.
Hey there, Captain.
Oh, is this your new assistant?
John Urblan.
Nice to meet ya.
And John Urblan has just been fired.
- What?
- I have?
Meet "ya"?
You just abbreviated a one-syllable word.
- Is this for real?
- Yes.
Now clean out your "des".
I removed the K so you'd understand how absurd "ya" sound.
Oh, boy.
Sorry, John Urblan.
Bye.
Okay, sir, so that is the third assistant you've fired in three days.
Because all the candidates are garbage.
Microsoft Word is not a special skill, Marcie Lux from South Orange.
Come on, look at the size of that stack of rÃ©sumÃ©s.
There's got to be someone good.
Oh, yes, perhaps I should keep an open mind.
Perhaps cross-country skiing is a valuable skill in an office environment, Marcie Lux of South Orange.
Okay, so we can agree Marcie Lux is out of the mix.
Well, they all are.
I'll just make do with no assistant.
No, don't just give up.
Maybe you haven't found the right person yet.
I found Gina.
Maybe I could try.
Okay.
I suppose it's worth a shot.
I can always fire whoever you choose.
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Commence Operation: Nasty.
New Assistant Selection Team You.
Operation: New Assistant Selection Team You?
Yeah, don't worry about it.
Everyone will just call it Operation: Nasty.
You don't have to turn everything into a Thomas Cruise film.
Why not?
Movies are super fun.
Meanwhile, real life is very boring.
That's why no one watches documentaries.
Tell that to the man sitting next to me at last Saturday afternoon's screening of "Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda".
Was that man Kevin?
- Yes.
- All right, I'm gonna help you find a new assistant.
Operation: Nasty is a go!
Hey, can I talk to you guys?
Ugh, you're not selling those crapola candy bars for your daughters' doomed basketball team again, are you?
- Doomed?
- Yeah.
- They're terrible and you know it.
- Well, I'm not selling candy.
That's next week.
Please bring cash.
What I want to talk about is how our office has turned into a junkyard.
Yeah, you know, this place is a mess.
I mean, it's like an episode of "Hoarders".
And not one of the funny ones, where they find a bunch of flat cats.
The problem is, Commissioner Kelly is never gonna reopen the first floor.
We should just fire some of the uniforms.
But not you.
Uh, we couldn't survive without you, Greg, and also Greg?
James and Michael.
No one is getting fired.
We just need to organize this place.
Nah, do what I do.
Embrace the mess.
You've got a bagel stuck to your sweater.
Look, I don't want to sound like a Scully here, but I think it's hopeless.
Nobody could organize this place.
- Nobody?
- Here's what I need.
Sticky notes, three sizes, ten colors.
Permanent markers, clickable only.
I don't want caps slowing us down.
And I need garbage bags, 33 gallon, blackout, cinch top.
What are you all still doing here?
Go, go, go!
Captain Holt, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.
Drumroll, please.
- That's your drumroll?
- When a tempo isn't specified, any reasonable person would default to lento.
Well, it's terrible, and you ruined a fun thing, but I would still like to introduce you to Mr. Gordon Lundt!
Mr. Gordon Lundt!
Gordon, you want to come in here?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was just deciding whether I should just go home.
The tone and tenor of your introduction make me worry that this is a "fun" office, which I would not enjoy.
Ehh?
Hello, I'm Captain Raymond Holt, and I can assure you, this is not a fun office.
Thank goodness.
In that case, my interest is renewed.
- Here is my rÃ©sumÃ©.
- Oh, I'm feeling this.
Are you guys feeling this?
Gordon, why don't you tell Captain Holt a little bit about yourself?
Where to begin?
I'm 174 centimeters tall, I can type 103 words per minute with an error rate of 1.6%, and I recently moved here from Philadelphia, which is the sixth most populous U.S. city.
I understand the city of Philadelphia is coterminous with Philadelphia County, making it the eighth-largest metropolitan statistical area.
Yeah, Philly's cool.
Isn't it fun - just telling each other facts?
-  Yes.
Well, I think I have all the information I need.
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lundt.
My pleasure.
So looks like Operation: Nasty is a full-on success, huh?
You mean Operation: Nasty Sex Slut.
Didn't you see him flirting with me?
No, I most definitely did not.
Then you're a blind man and a prude to boot.
Did you see his tie?
A single Windsor.
The easiest knot to undo.
Why bother wearing any clothes at all?
I think you badly misread that interaction.
Please.
He did everything but lick his lips and purr.
Get rid of him, and bring me someone who can keep it in their slacks.
Did someone say to take off our slacks?
No, not even close.
Oh.
Well, keep me posted.
My dogs are barkin'.
What dogs?
Okay, Marie Kondo came up with a system to unclutter your life.
You look at an object, and if it doesn't bring you joy, you throw it away.
Try it, Sarge.
Hello, backup pair of suspenders.
Do you bring me joy?
Yes, because you have tab endings and a sweet leather yoke.
I'm so glad you're in my life.
- I guess I'm keeping 'em.
- Ooh, let me try.
Hello, bag of old dried mushrooms.
Do you bring me joy?
Yes!
You provide rich, earthy flavor to both soups and teas.
I guess I'm keeping mine too.
This is fun.
Guys, you can't keep everything.
That defeats the purpose.
I got this, Ames.
Hello, unsolved case.
Do you bring me joy?
No, because you're boring and you're too hard.
See ya.
Personal items only, Scully.
Get that case out of the trash.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Sir, we need to talk about Gordon Lundt, and before you ask, - I have not fired him.
- Yes, I noticed.
He's been strutting around like a peacock, trying desperately to arouse me, his unwilling peahen.
Did you hear there's a barrel-making exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum of Industry?
Yes.
Has he no shame?
The door was open.
I think he wanted people to hear.
Yeah, well, I didn't fire him because I thought you were being crazy and I wanted to change your mind, so I called all the places he used to work.
You didn't do that before you brought him in?
What?
No, you check references after there's a problem.
That's hiring 101.
Anyways, it turns out he never worked at the Philadelphia PD.
So he's a liar and a hussy?
Why is he still here?
Because I started thinking, why would he lie?
And the answer is: because he's a spy, planted here by Commissioner Kelly.
Think about it.
You've been rounding up all the captains who oppose him.
Kelly wants those names.
Gordon was sent here to seduce you.
- He's a red sparrow.
- You mean a honeypot.
Potato, tomato, but yes.
He is the world's most boring sex spy, and he's here to infiltrate the Nine-Nine.
No, this is just you still trying to make everything into a movie.
This is the real world, Peralta.
There are no spies in our midst.
I'm sure Gordon just lied on his rÃ©sumÃ© to get a job.
Oh, really?
Then how come he's in this old staff photo from the Three-Six?
Kelly's old precinct?
You're right.
Gordon's a honeypot.
Or a red sparrow.
Buzz, buzz, little bee.
Fly, bird, fly.
- Buzz.
- Fly.
- Buzz.
- Fly.
- Buzz.
- Fly.
The point is, we're on the same page.
He's a spy.
- Hey, Hitchcock.
-  God, you scared me.
I've got a razor.
Sorry.
I need the bathroom.
Fine, but you're lucky I didn't cut myself.
Yep, sure am.
Have a good one, buddy.
- Any poopers?
- None.
What is this?
Why are we meeting in the bathroom?
- Super cool meeting spot.
-  Don't roll your eyes at me, Daria.
Commissioner Kelly sent a spy into our midst.
This is happening.
We need to talk about our plan.
Okay, here it is.
I'm going to fire him.
You can't do that.
In a movie, when you find out someone's a spy, you don't fire them.
You can either have them murdered - Not an option.
- Yeah, I know, we're cops.
Blah, blah.
No one likes this side of you.
Or we can launch a counter-spying mission.
I just want him out of the Nine-Nine.
If we can prove that Kelly sent a spy into one of his own precincts to seduce a captain, it's gonna look really bad for him.
- And how will we prove that?
- With Operation: Dragon.
Don't Reveal Anything, Gordon's Our Nemesis.
- No.
- I worked so hard on that acronym.
You're not even going to acknowledge it?
All right, look, if Kelly's been communicating with Gordon, there has to be evidence on his laptop.
Yeah, but he doesn't leave his computer unattended.
It's always in his bag, which he always has on his person.
How do you know that?
I've glanced at his work satchel.
I'm married, but I'm still a man.
Choosing to ignore that.
Now, if there were only some place where they make you check your bag, like an airport, or even a museum?
No.
I couldn't.
Couldn't you?
Mr. Lundt, would you like to go to the barrel-making exhibit this evening?
Yes, Captain Holt.
I could make time for that.
I need a shower.
Okay, I went through my desk and got rid of everything that didn't give me joy.
You didn't get rid of anything.
Because it all gives me joy.
Picture of Nikolaj, joy.
Cocktail napkin from my first date with Genevieve, joy.
Birthday card from my urologist, joy.
He was the only doctor of my entire urethral support staff who remembered.
All right, I don't think Marie Kondo's gonna work here.
We need something stronger.
The Norwegian system: Munkensmat.
It was designed by a radical group of Scandinavian organizers who are doing things with cubbies that would blow your minds.
We need to Munkensmat.
- "Munkensmat"?
- Sexy, right?
In Munkensmat, you get rid of all personal possessions - except one.
- I can't do that.
What, I'm just supposed to get rid of my great-grandfather's shoes?
He had one baby foot.
This is cruel.
Munkensmat isn't cruel.
It's freeing.
When you cling to these things, you cling to the past, and you don't leave room for new experiences.
Okay, what one thing should I keep?
Hatchet or Blu-ray of "The Intern"?
You can always watch "The Intern" online.
Not the extras.
There's a virtual tour of Jules's kitchen.
Monster.
Well, Sarge, what's it gonna be, pictures of your kids or those suspenders?
Terry can't throw his family away, but these are nice suspenders.
Are they special in some kind of way?
Damn, Amy, I told you about the leather yoke!
Terry, you're clinging.
- Munkensmat.
- My turn.
It's between my seizure medication and this fidget spinner.
I think I made the right call.
Uh-oh.
I forgot that it lit up.
I've made a terrible mistake.
Look at that.
They put the sherry barrels right up front.
Ugh.
I hate it when museums pander to the tourists.
Oh, I think you need to check your bag, Gordon.
It's a small price to pay to make sure the barrels are protected.
My thoughts exactly.
- The package is headed your way.
- Copy that.
This better work.
I'm debasing myself out here.
- What must people think?
- Relax.
There's literally no other people at this museum.
Thank you very much.
Here is $100.
Pleasure doing business with you.
You know, you could have just stolen the bag, and wouldn't have noticed or cared.
Ugh.
Be better, Yanya.
- Okay.
- Yanya!
Okay, sir, I am cloning the hard drive.
You should only have to distract him for three hours?
Good Lord.
Do you think that you can talk about barrels for three hours?
Watch me.
Ah, Gordon, take a gander at this brine barrel from 1787.
It looks to me like the work of master hooper Josiah Wooldruff, who learned the craft from his father Jesiah Wooldruff, who in turn learned it from his.
I'm already so bored.
The slats are not flat.
They're curved.
The base of the barrel is approximately 20 Every barrel is inspected before usage.
The key is that the oak was cured and shaped by Josiah's cousin Joshua, who was a cooper and not a hooper.
Wait, are you still at the same barrel?
Please move on to another one.
There are so many barrels in there.
You know what?
Let's look at that barrel.
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a brine barrel as well.
It was also made in the 1780s.
In fact, it's identical to the last barrel.
Let's review why that's interesting.
No!
Having each selected our one item, we move on to stage two, cleansing.
In Munkensmat, you don't just throw away your discarded belongings.
- You incinerate them.
- What?
Can't we just donate this stuff?
So you can go to Goodwill after work and buy back those suspenders you're so attached to?
- No.
- Now, in true Munkensmat, you pile all of your belongings on a raft, push it out to the icy sea, and set fire to it with a flaming arrow.
But since we obviously don't have an archer I'm an archer.
I have like six bows in my car.
Really?
Launch.
Oh, Munkensmat.
Munkensmat.
Munkensmat!
Have you reviewed the contents of Gordon's computer?
Did you find anything?
Uh, well, hem, haw Are you literally saying "hem" and "haw"?
Look, I haven't found anything, okay?
Not a single email between Kelly and Gordon.
So I whored myself out at that museum for nothing.
Not entirely for nothing.
You know?
We had fun.
Sneaking around, bribing people, lying, stealing stuff.
Coming home and having my husband ask me why I smelled like barrels?
Seriously?
What did you say?
I told him everything.
He understood, until I showed him a picture of Gordon.
The thought of me at a museum with that ten?
He banished me to the guest room.
Captain Holt, are you in there?
Oh, no, it's him.
What does he want?
Do you think he knows something happened at the Barrel Museum?
I wanted to talk to you about something that happened at the Barrel Museum.
I think he knows.
This is bad!
Well, the longer we talk, the more suspicious it seems.
- Tell him to come in.
- Come in!
Oh.
I prefer to discuss this matter in private.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say - in front of Peralta.
- Very well.
I've been sent here to spy on you.
What?
I am truly shocked.
We are both shocked.
Commissioner Kelly knows you're recruiting a team of captains to oppose him.
He asked me to find out who they are.
But I've decided I won't help him.
- Why not?
- Because I've fallen in love with you.
What?
That is truly shocking.
For real this time.
What?
The plan was for me to weaken your defenses with my brazen sexuality.
I wouldn't say "brazen" so much as "completely undetectable".
I couldn't have been more obvious.
I wore a single Windsor knot.
I might as well have a sign around my neck that reads "DTF".
"Desiring Thorough Fornication".
- Nope.
- Exactly.
- Oh.
- At first, the flirting was just part of the ruse.
It meant nothing to me.
But then the Barrel Museum.
- I fell hard.
- Not surprising.
It is an erotically charged atmosphere.
The curve of the slats, the rivets, the bilge, the bunghole.
Okay, I am actually starting to hear the sex talk now.
The bunghole is the least erotic part of the barrel.
- It's simply functional.
- Sure.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Bunghole.
Continue.
Captain, I know nothing could ever happen between us, but I care about you too much to do Kelly's dirty work, which is why I'm tendering my resignation.
That's very honorable.
I accept.
Oh, no, you don't.
This could be our chance.
We can turn Kelly's agent into a double agent.
Operation: Double Dragon.
Oh, it's all starting to happen.
I don't want to play these movie spy games, Peralta.
- It could backfire.
- Or it could front-fire.
- What?
- It worked.
Gordon, do you have any hard proof - that Kelly sent you here?
- Nothing in writing.
We only communicate in person.
Okay, so you call Kelly, arrange for a meeting, then you wear a wire, and we have tape of the commissioner admitting that he's spying on one of his captains.
It could work, but I could never put Gordon in that position.
I would do anything for you, Captain Holt.
Thank you.
And you can call me Raymond.
Captain Raymond Holt.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
You're right, too much.
That should never have happened.
- Agreed.
- Wait, what?
Did something just happen?
I've been standing here the whole time.
What did I miss?
What did I miss?
What did I miss?
Hey, can I take a couple photos of your desk?
I want to submit them to "Organizers Quarterly".
- What?
- There's a magazine - about organizing?
- Yeah.
I want to be featured as Organizer of the Month.
Just imagine, me on the cover with tons of scarves lying around.
I'm holding them up like, "This is too many scarves.
We got to do something"!
Okay.
Ooh, now can you open the drawers?
If you want to get featured, you got to show them what's under the skirt, know what I mean?
Uh, no, there are case files in here.
I don't want any sensitive info to get out.
I'll blur the personal stuff.
Come on, this is the money shot.
Seriously, Terry?
You didn't throw out the suspenders?
What?
That's not fair.
I had to throw out Great Grandpa Ellen's bitty shoe!
Why are you even holding on to these?
- I've never seen you wear them.
- I haven't.
I saw them at the store, and they're obviously way better than my normal suspenders.
- Are they?
- Yeah!
Tab endings, leather yoke.
I can't keep describing them.
- All right, calm down.
- I'm sorry.
I bought them right before I took the lieutenant's exam.
I was gonna wear them on my first day as a lieutenant, but then I failed the test.
I thought I'd keep them just in case I ever pass it, but I'll be honest.
That's never gonna happen.
I'll just throw them out.
There.
You can take your photo now.
The deadline's tomorrow.
We're just listening from afar.
Do we really need to be in disguise?
Yes, Carmine.
Yes, we do.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Your cover is Carmine Frunch.
You have emphysema, and your best friend is your pet bird.
I'm not sure I like this persona.
Well, if you make it too cool, it's not believable.
By the way, my name is Jackson Fox.
I'm an NBA player, and LeBron James is my best friend.
Oh, here comes Kelly.
So, Mr. Lundt.
Good to see you.
What's all this about?
Captain Holt and the Nine-Nine.
That's it, Gordon.
Lure him in.
He's plotting against you with a group of captains.
I'm only here because he asked me to help him entrap you.
- What is happening?
- He's triple-crossing us.
Holt is listening in from that surveillance vehicle.
Hey, Gordon, can you still hear me?
- Yes.
- You are blowing this, man!
Oh, hi, Raymond.
Good to see you.
- Pull up a chair.
- Cut the crap.
Stop masking your evil with a candy cane smile.
Ooh, I love candy canes.
Everyone loves candy canes, John Kelly.
Now admit you sent in this boring bastard to honeypot Holt.
It feels like you two are the spies based on your disguises, et cetera.
Nuh-uh.
This is who we actually are.
A professional basketball player and a guy with a bird friend.
Oh, it's not just about disguises.
Everything that you recorded on your wire clearly indicates that I was the one being spied on.
- Ow.
- Case closed.
Pretty cool, huh?
I can't wait to play that tape for the mayor.
You are gonna look so bad, Raymond.
You're never gonna get away with this, Kelly.
Oh, I already have.
Worked out better than I expected.
I just sent Lundt in to find out which captains you'd rallied against me, and then you decided you wanted to bug the commissioner of the NYPD.
Somebody shot themselves in the foot.
Hey, do me a favor.
Put your resignation on my desk in the morning.
I'm so sorry, sir.
This is all my fault.
Operation: Double Dragon was a debacle.
Yes, it was.
If only someone had thought to plan a backup operation.
- Did you do something cool?
- I did something very cool.
While I was banished to the guest room, I flipped across one of those Thomas Cruise films on Home Box Office, and I realized something.
On a spy mission, there's always another twist.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I knew you would triple-cross our double-cross, so I planted a microphone in the napkin holder.
There's one in the flowerpot.
Ketchup, mustard.
There are mics in both.
- Where?
- In the tips.
Oh, this is so great.
Where else are there mics?
- Nowhere.
- Oh.
But there are cameras!
There's a camera, there's a camera, and there's a camera.
I've got you on tape, Kelly.
You're screwed.
The only thing that's gonna be on your desk in the morning is a list of my demands.
Operation: Triple Dragon is complete.
- You named it.
- Not only did I name it, Triple Dragon is an acronym.
Two Righteous Individuals Performing Law Enforcement Directives Rapidly Against Gordon Our Nemesis.
Triple Dragon!
This is the best thing that's ever happened!
I mean, not for you, obviously.
It's bad for you.
What is all this junk on my desk?
It's not very Munkensmat.
They're study materials for the lieutenant's exam.
You can't give up.
You're gonna take the exam again, you're gonna ace it, and then you're gonna wear these.
My lieutenant suspenders.
You fished them out of the trash.
No, they were covered in precinct goo, but I got you a new pair, - leather yoke and all.
- Aw.
Some things are worth clinging to.
I was wrong.
Or Niles Bunkampf, the inventor of Munkensmat, was wrong.
- Yeah, that guy's an idiot.
- Was an idiot.
He got rid of all his objects, including his clothes, and froze to death in a snowdrift.
Why didn't you tell us that before we burned all our treasures?
Eight framed photos of my dad, up in flames.
So does this mean we can start keeping personal objects in the office again?
Yes, on one condition.
No one tells Bruce from "Organizers Quarterly".
I'm definitely not gonna reach out to Bruce.
Oh, thank you.
You're a good friend.
Ah, good morning, Captain Holt.
You're looking refreshed.
Interesting.
I didn't sleep a wink.
Let's just say Kevin no longer has me in the guest room.
Nice.
My two dads, straight smashin' it.
Sorry, that came out weird.
Title of your sex tape.
But more importantly, how did it go with Commissioner Kelly?
I gave him a list of my demands, and he's agreed to back off of vigilant policing.
- Whoa, that's amazing.
- But that's not all.
I also got something for the precinct.
Is it a fighter jet?
How did you get a fighter jet?
We don't have the budget for that.
- It's not a fighter jet.
- Aw.
I got him to reopen the first floor.
-  -  It's back to normal.
It's beautiful.
Thank you, sir.
I couldn't have done it without you.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to take you out tonight for a thank-you dinner.
Oh, I would love that, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check, 'cause Amy and I already have plans.
Although I'm pretty sure you would approve.
So this is a brine barrel.
It's made by Josiah Wooldruff, who learned the craft from his father Jesiah Wooldruff, who in turn learned you know what?
This was a terrible idea.
I'm sorry.
- Don't you dare stop.
- Oh.
Okay.
Josiah's cousin Joshua was a cooper, not a hooper.
Oh, mama.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 And now on to new business.
Peralta.
There's a case I'd like you to handle.
Methodist Hospital called this morning.
Apparently, a 38-year-old investment banker was admitted last night with a broken penis.
- It looks like - Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's a finance guy with a broken dong?
Uh, methinks some "Wolf of Wall Street" style shenana-googles have taken place this day.
Anyone care to wager a guess as to how this happened?
Yeah, I bet he dipped it in a pile of cocaine, got it real numb, and then hit a croquet ball with it.
- Totally possible.
- He probably sat on it.
- So it got under his butt.
- Happens all the time.
- Sure do.
- Ugh, you guys are horrible.
And you're wrong because he was clearly driving his Bentley naked, tried to pee out the window, and was then struck by a goose on the wang.
Is that what happened, sir?
Was he struck by a goose?
He was actually struck by a female coworker who claims he attempted to sexually assault her.
-  - I really wish you had stopped us before we started guessing.
I'm not responsible for that.
Now due to the sensitive subject matter, I think it makes sense to partner Peralta with Me?
Because I'm the best at sex?
No, Hitchcock.
In fact, you know what?
This isn't your week.
Why don't you take a few days off?
Sweet!
- Have fun working, cucks!
- What?
Captain, I'd like to work the case with Jake.
I have the time.
I'm three weeks ahead on my paperwork.
Fine.
Santiago and Peralta, talk to both parties.
Get to the bottom of this broken penis.
Wait.
I just want to say I think it's sad that we as a society can no longer laugh at the phrase "broken penis," and it is my dream that we one day shall again.
Team Broken Penis on three.
- One, two, three - Broken penis!
Yeah, probably should've seen that coming.
Mr. Haggerty, please have a seat.
Oh, you can stand if that's more comfortable.
No, it's cool.
The doctor said I need to change positions frequently so I don't form a penile clot.
Oh, I'm not gonna barf, so on that note, please explain the events that led to your diaper.
So last night I was giving my coworker, Keri, some pointers on her trades.
Told her "lever up on VTC.
There's no fat tail on the vol's wicked low".
I just didn't want her to chump it.
Right, and you spoke that way because you were - snowboarding?
- No, we were in my office.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, she just flipped out and hit me with my favorite golf club.
Ms. Brennan is claiming she attacked you in self-defense after you sexually assaulted her.
Yeah, because she's crazy.
I know we're not supposed to say that about women.
I usually wouldn't go there because I'm a huge advocate.
I mean, I'm the kind of guy who thinks Kathryn Bigelow should direct the next "Star Wars".
I've said that out loud to other men.
Thank you, Mr. Haggerty.
We'll be in touch.
Great, thanks.
I'm gonna stand up now.
-  - Captain, sorry to interrupt.
I just got off the phone with the Department of Corrections.
They wanted me to let you know that Ernest Zumowski died.
My goodness.
It's been a while since I've heard that name.
I hunted him for years and finally caught him and put an end to his bloodlust.
In some sick way, I am who I am because of Ernest Zumowski - AKA -  The Disco Strangler.
Oh, so you knew who I was talking about?
Yeah, sir, you talk about him a lot.
- You know, the yo-yo was his -  Calling card.
Oh, I mentioned that too?
So how'd he die?
He was in a prison transport van, and he got in a terrible accident.
It burst into flames, and he was trapped inside.
Well, well, well, he finally did it.
- Died horribly?
- Escaped.
Just like he said he would all those years ago.
I'll be coming back for you.
I'm just like disco, baby.
I will never die.
True, disco will never die, but you will  In your cell, punk.
Oh, so I've told that part of the story as well?
Yes, at every Christmas party.
Sir, I am the first to tout the capabilities of senior citizens.
I have made love to many, but the Disco Strangler is over 80.
I doubt that he could pull off an escape like this.
Oh, that's what he wants you to think.
You're both underestimating him.
I know 28 other people who did that, and they all ended up with yo-yos - around their throats.
-  Necks.
Nope, I said "throats," not necks, which means I haven't told that story too many times.
All right, lace up your dancing shoes because it's time to catch this disco bastard.
Thank you for coming in, Ms. Brennan.
Can you describe your working relationship with Mr. Haggerty?
Absolutely.
Seth hired me three years ago to help with large-scale statistical arbitrage and ever since we've been at a steady 18% yield.
I didn't know most of those words, but I'm assuming it means you're good at business.
I am good.
I brought in $168 million to the firm last quarter.
Wow, that's a lot of money.
Where do you keep it all?
It's in a computer.
I've watched too much "DuckTales".
No, you can never watch too much "DuckTales".
It's my dream to have a gold coin pool.
- Like Scrooge McD.
Continue.
- Look.
I love my job, and I'm really good at it.
I would never do anything to jeopardize what I have, and I'm not a violent person, but last night Seth crossed a line.
Can you tell us what happened?
I was working late, and he called me into his office.
He had clearly been drinking, and before I knew it, he pushed me into a desk and he tried to take my clothes off.
So I grabbed his stupid golf club and I hit him in the Cookie Monster, which is what he calls his penis, by the way.
- Gross.
- He's the worst.
My only regret is that I didn't get in two extra whacks for each of his testicles.
What does he call those?
Bert and Ernie?
You are actually correct.
Ugh, I hate that I got that right.
So in conclusion: the burns on Zumowski's body are consistent with a massive vehicle fire.
- If this even is his body.
- Excuse me?
We're talking about the Disco Strangler a serial killer, who for six years stayed one step ahead of the entire NYPD.
Not sure he had many steps left in him, sir.
- Take a look.
- Aw.
- He looks fragile and sweet.
- Sweet as poison pie.
Were you able to match the dental records - to the Disco Strangler?
- No, the body had no teeth.
- Well, that's suspicious.
- Not really.
Zumowski didn't have any teeth either.
- Due to him being very old?
- Yes.
What about the fact that this corpse is 71 inches tall when the Disco Strangler was 76?
He shrank over time.
Is that another old person thing?
Yes, it is.
Another old person thing.
- Mm-hmm.
- We also have a DNA match between hair on the head of this body and the Disco Strangler.
Sir, this is clearly Zumowski.
And that's a good thing.
You can finally say good-bye to your nemesis.
Thanks, sergeant.
That's a nice thought.
For an idiot to have.
Look at this.
A dirty little string?
Oh, it's not just any old string.
It's a yo-yo string, the most dangerous part of the yo-yo.
The Strangler wanted me to find this.
He's out there, and he's taunting me.
Okay, Ms. Brennan, we've discussed it, and we think you should file charges against Mr. Haggerty for sexual assault.
Now, I'm not gonna lie to you, it's a difficult process Actually, I'm gonna stop you right there.
I don't wanna press charges.
The firm just offered me $2.5 million if I sign an NDA and let this slide.
Wait, so you're gonna let Seth get off Scot-free?
Well, that money would go a long way towards the Scrooge pool.
Sorry, ignore me.
- "DuckTales".
Woo-oo.
- I mean, I think I have to take it.
This is a "he said, she said," situation.
I know how that goes down.
No one's gonna convict him on my word alone.
The system's as broken as Seth's dong.
No, it's not.
I'm the system.
And I'm nothing like Seth's dong.
It feels like we can move off this analogy.
Just don't sign that NDA right now.
Give us a chance to bring this guy to justice.
And how are you gonna do that?
By working our asses off to find proof that he assaulted you, and when we do, he will go to jail for what he did.
I really think we can get him.
Okay.
Yeah, let's do this.
Oh, man, I'm reading Keri's statement.
If I was a woman, I would not work in finance.
Oh, because it's so easy for women everywhere else.
Okay, I can tell that I am in trouble.
You're not in trouble.
I just don't think that men understand how different everything is for us.
I can think of a million examples from this week alone.
Oh, sick!
Oh, sick!
- Have a great day.
- Oh, thanks.
- You too.
- Mm-hmm.
You have a beautiful mouth.
Have a great day.
Excuse me, Miss, do you know where I can find a police officer?
Uh, sir, you're a police officer, right?
- Yeah, I'm a detective.
- Oh, thank God.
I'm in uniform!
Oh, that's why you yelled that.
I thought you were just excited about your general love of uniforms.
Usually when I yell that, it is because of my love of uniforms but not today.
Today it was because of that sexist jerk.
God, how many creeps have I not noticed before oh, no.
The fruit seller guy on our corner, is he a creep?
No, he's a real gentleman, which is surprising because he's always holding those two cantaloupes and the opportunity to be gross is right there.
Is it?
I've never even noticed that before.
I never wanted to make a comment or anything like that and thought better.
Anyways.
I am genuinely very sorry that this is something you have to go through all the time.
It's okay.
I'm used to it.
That's even sadder.
I know.
But you know what's not sad?
That Keri didn't take that insane amount of hush money, and now we get - to put a bad guy in jail.
- Amen.
Wait, her firm offered her a big deal and you told her - not to take it?
- Yeah.
Because that would mean letting a sexual assaulter go free.
Do you have any physical evidence to prove that he did it?
No.
So it sounds like he might go free anyway.
I mean, at least if she takes the deal, she won't walk away with nothing.
I'm surprised you feel like that.
You're such a feminist.
I feel like maybe I shouldn't be here.
I am a feminist, but I'm also a realist.
I'm just looking out for the victim.
Or should I be here because men should be part of the conversation?
Let's say best case scenario you do find evidence.
She's still gonna have to go through a very public trial where they drag her name through the mud.
Even if she wins, she still loses.
It's two steps forward, one step back.
I've landed on active listening.
I will no longer be chiming in.
Yeah, but when one person comes forward, it inspires others to speak up.
And that's a hell of a lot better than taking a deal that lets sexual predators walk free.
Dude, obviously, I get that.
I'm just saying, remember that there's a very real woman here whose career and life are gonna be affected by you pursuing this case.
I'm just saying, consider what's best for her.
All right, the state police is deploying 30 men and four helicopters to comb the area of the accident.
I felt comfortable saying this disco-man has danced his last disco dance.
Sir, it's fun to see you breaking out the old lingo, but do you think you're jumping the gun?
All the evidence points to the Strangler being dead.
- Not all the evidence.
- Right.
The random piece of thread you think is a yo-yo string.
It is a yo-yo string.
The most dangerous part of the yo-yo.
It just feels like you're trying to relive - your glory days.
- Absurd.
Well, what do you have in that box over there?
Memories and keepsakes of my greatest cases.
-  Mm-hmm.
- To remind me of the Strangler's MO.
He always seduced an accomplice into doing his fiendish bidding.
I bet it was the van driver.
You mean the woman who was thrown violently from the vehicle and just barely survived?
Yeah, I'm sure she was very "badly injured".
Sorry if my voice is raspy.
They just took the breathing tube out.
- But they left the BS in?
- Good God.
- Whoa.
- So, Ms. Park, it says in my file that you drove Mr. Zumowski - on multiple occasions.
- Yes.
Because he had to go to the hospital a lot.
He was very, very old.
- She's clearly been seduced.
- She has?
Let's cut the crap.
You helped him escape.
You planted a cadaver in the back.
You flipped the van on purpose.
Then the Strangler set it on fire and sprinkled some of his hair nearby so there'd be a DNA match.
Then he left behind his calling card: this yo-yo string!
- That's not a yo-yo string.
- What?
That's part of the lanyard we give to the older inmates - when they become fall risks.
- You're lying.
You've succumbed to his groovy voodoo!
Sir, I don't think she's lying.
Look at this photo from the file.
Oh, my goodness.
So this string is just a string?
The DNA was really a match?
The Disco Strangler is actually dead.
And that chapter of my life is forever closed.
Well, that's fantastic news.
Okay, we have you set up here.
We have a VR experience down the hall where you can fly like a bird, and if you need anything else just buzz and one of our butlers will assist you.
This place is amazing.
It's like a dream factory.
We're investigating a sexual assault that occurred in these offices.
Right, of course.
I know.
This is how people get tempted by the devil.
I see what you're up to, platter of tiny quiches.
We need to get someone on the record about Seth's patterned behaviors.
I think if we start with How many tiny quiches do you have in your mouth?
Five.
I'll swallow them.
Let's just start the interviews.
I don't think something like that would happen here.
It's an extremely professional workplace, and Seth's a really good guy.
I don't think he's even ever bought a prostitute before.
Is that the minimum requirement for being - a good guy these days?
- Can I go?
Beefer's birthday's starting and a bunch of Mets are here.
Present day or '86?
- Both.
- I'm gonna escort him back.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Seth has never been inappropriate with me.
He's a really good guy.
Honestly, this is an extremely professional workplace.
Dude, Beefer just puked in the koi pond.
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize the cop thing was in here.
This is an extremely professional workplace, and Seth is a really good guy.
Hey, I'm Beefer.
It's my birthday.
- Yeah, we heard.
- Happy Birthday, Beefer.
Beefer's not my real name.
They just call me that 'cause I beefed on my first day.
Okay, but for the record, no one asked.
I don't have anything bad to say about Seth.
He's a really good guy, and this office is what's the word?
-  Extremely professional.
- Yes!
Hello, Sergeant Santiago and Detective Peralta.
I'm the Deputy General Counsel here at the firm.
I can only assume your questioning has revealed nothing negative about Mr. Haggerty's character.
Only because you told them exactly what to say.
We did no such thing.
These allegations of sexual assault are ridiculous.
If they're so ridiculous, then why offer Keri Brennan - hush money?
- That wasn't hush money.
That was a benevolent gesture to allow Ms. Brennan to get the professional help she so clearly needs.
However, since she has chosen to pursue this matter with the police, that deal is now null and void.
Furthermore, we are terminating her.
-  What?
- We have a zero tolerance policy for violence here.
And unlike Ms. Brennan, Mr. Haggerty has actual evidence of an assault.
He's talking about my broken penis.
Yeah, Seth, we know.
Hey, you never came home last night.
You doing okay?
No, I'm a mess.
- I miss Hitchcock.
- What?
I was obviously talking to Amy.
Oh, and who's talking to Scully?
No one.
Come on, sandwich.
Ames, you've been working yourself to the bone on this case for three days straight.
Now, I'm starting to worry about you.
I have to solve this case, Jake.
Otherwise Keri lost the settlement and the job that she loves because of me, just like Rosa said.
But I can't find anything.
I've read through three years of Seth's emails, and it's mostly inquiries about where he could buy a Batmobile.
Tah, so stupid, but did he find one?
Is it like at a dealership or something?
Never mind.
Look, I know this sucks, and I hate to say it, but we both know sometimes you work a case and you just don't have the evidence.
This isn't just a case for me.
When I was a rookie at the Six-Four, my captain was my first mentor.
He helped me get on the detective track, and he gave me all the best cases.
But when I finally made detective, he took me to dinner and tried to kiss me.
He said that he felt like he deserved something in return for my career.
I just ran out of the restaurant back to the office, and I put in my transfer for the Nine-Nine.
Oh, man.
I'm so sorry.
I never told anyone because I felt like maybe I didn't actually deserve my promotion.
And I worried that I wouldn't get anymore promotions if I spoke up, so God.
Every time I think I understand how bad it is, it's just way worse than I imagined.
This kind of stuff has happened to literally every woman I know.
I just wanted to help make it better for this one woman.
- Okay.
- Wait, where are you going?
I'm gonna go get you a change of clothes and a coffee.
We're not giving up.
Okay.
Hey, what if we reach out to all the coworkers again, privately?
Maybe they didn't talk to us because we interviewed them in their office.
I think that's a great idea.
I'll be right back.
Oh, I'm also gonna grab a comb, but you don't have to use it unless you decide.
Okay, babe.
Sir, you haven't come out of your office in a while.
- How are you doing?
- Terrible.
You were right.
I was trying to relive my glory years, but the fact remains, they are behind me.
My only nemesis now Father Time.
Come on, sir.
That's ridiculous.
You're on the cutting edge.
In fact, you're so progressive, they were scared to make you Police Commissioner.
-  - You're as modern as they come.
What is that noise?
- It's my fax machine.
- Oh, Captain.
-  Zowie.
I'm young!
- What is it?
It's an aerial photograph from one of the helicopters I had deployed.
Take a gander, boys.
It's him.
The Disco Strangler.
Oh, my God.
You were right.
Of course I was.
I know him better than anyone.
- We're two sides of the same -  Coin!
You've told us this story many times.
And you'll hear it again!
So we're meeting a guy named Steve.
He said he couldn't speak openly with us when we met him in the conference room.
Steve?
I don't remember a Steve.
- Who's Steve?
- I am.
Beefer?
- So your real name is Steve?
- Yeah, I hate it.
- Makes me sound like a douche.
- Yeah, Beefer's better.
So why'd you agree to meet with us?
I wanted to show you this text chain between Seth and some of the guys in the office.
Whoa, Seth describes the night exactly like Keri did.
And then he writes "LOLZ, Epic Fail".
What's this GIF he sent?
Oh, that's Kelsey Grammer falling off a stage.
-  - I was really torn about whether or not I should send this to you guys but then I thought about it for a long time and realized it was the right thing to do.
Oh, who would have guessed Beefer's a secret feminist.
No, gross.
I meant it was the right thing to do for me.
- Huh?
- If they fire Seth, - I take his job.
- Okay.
Well, we got what we needed here.
So I think we're gonna leave before you ruin the moment any further.
Sweet.
I'll send it to ya.
Thanks for the promosh, narks.
You're the nark.
- Let's go.
- Yeah.
All right, people, your suspect's name is Ernest Zumowski, better known as the Disco Strangler.
Take a close look.
This is the most dangerous man in America.
5'8", hunched over, 93 pounds with gray hair and blue-gray skin.
If you encounter him, keep your distance.
All due respect, sir, seems like a lot of manpower to take down one sweet-looking old man.
Oh, he's sweet, all right.
Sweet as poison pie.
Yeah, don't underestimate him!
I know 28 other people who did that, and they all have yo-yos swinging from their throats.
- So you were listening.
- Yeah, we were saying that - all along.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
All right, troops.
Travel in twos.
Keep your eyes open, and for God's sake, protect the neck.
Hey, Keri.
Great news: the DA's going to press charges against Haggerty.
I heard.
That's awesome.
Thank you, guys.
Hey, what's with the boxes?
Moving to a better desk?
With a better butler and more of those mini quiches?
No, I'm taking my stuff home.
I had to quit.
Whaaat?
What do you mean, you quit?
Are they forcing you out?
- Because that's illegal.
- No, they're not.
But the whole atmosphere here has changed.
Everybody looks at me like I'm either a victim or a trader.
I mean, I'm not even on any of the non-work group texts.
And last night Beefer invited everybody over for whiskey and cigars, and I wasn't included.
Well, I mean, is not hanging out with Beefer really a punishment, per se?
Yeah, but if I'm not at Beefer's for whiskey and cigars, then I don't get invited to Vegas with Slurpie and Trundle, and I'm definitely not at Skidmark's pig roast.
Man, these nicknames are just bad.
I actually came up with Skidmark.
It's very funny if you know the back story.
- He pooped his pants?
-  Yeah.
But the point is, if I'm not at those events, then suddenly I'm not looked at for new accounts or promotions or anything.
My career here is over.
I'm really sorry.
I feel like a messed up.
I shouldn't have talked you into turning down - that settlement.
- Hey, Seth attacked me.
And I'm really proud of myself that I didn't let him get away with that.
So, even though it sucks, if I had to do it all again, I would.
Especially the broken penis.
- Why'd she say that to me?
- I don't know.
Freeze!
NYPD!
Is that Raymond Holt I see?
You haven't changed a bit.
- Neither have you, Ernest.
- What?
Neither have you, Ernest.
What?
Neither have you, Ernest!
Ugh, this is hard to watch.
You're just as devious as ever.
You seduced the van driver, didn't you?
No, I seduced the van driver.
She couldn't resist my groovy voodoo.
And the yo-yo string was a message.
- The what was a what?
- The yo-yo string was Captain, this is embarrassing.
Can we just take him in?
Yeah, you're right.
This isn't what I hoped for.
Go ahead and cuff him, gently.
This isn't the last you'll hear from me, Raymond.
- I'm never gonna die.
- Sure you won't.
- Whatever makes you feel better.
- No, you're the punk.
Just put him in the car.
Hey, heard you guys got that finance creep.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
But there's nothing to congratulate me about.
Amy's just upset because the historically entrenched patriarchy has created a culture of victim-shaming that suppresses any power shift in our masculo-phallic system.
- Huh?
- I couldn't sleep last night so I watched a documentary on Netflix about feminism.
I love you.
Just sucks that she came forward to report an assault and the only one who truly benefited - is a guy named Beefer.
- You don't know Beefer but Oh, I've met plenty of Beefers.
- Yeah.
- Look this is a hard fight.
But it's an important one.
It's good that you convinced her to press charges.
But she lost the money, and she had to quit the job she loves.
That's exactly what you said would happen.
But you got the guy who assaulted her.
And look over there.
- Keri's coworker?
- She came forward to report an assault because she was inspired by Keri, which is exactly what you said would happen.
Two steps forward, one step back is still one step forward.
You wanna take her statement together?
- You know it, sister.
- Yeah, don't do that.
We can be different and still have the same cause.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
1 Sir, you wanted to see me?
Yes, I have an assignment for you.
I'm afraid it's not a pleasant one.
Oh, my God.
Please tell me it's not Yes, it's Hitchcock related.
Son of a bitch.
Detective Hitchcock is set to testify in court this afternoon.
It's an important case, and I'd rather not get another call from the DA saying he showed up "covered in condiments".
So you want me to keep Hitchcock from spilling on himself for the rest of the day?
We both know that's impossible.
- I'm counting on you.
- I won't do it.
- There's nobody else I trust.
- What you're asking is insane.
- I'm not asking.
- It's a suicide mission!
- Then prepare for death.
- You've lost your mind!
This is a direct order, Detective!
Get in line!
Hey.
You guys startled Hitchcock.
He spilled two full jars of spaghetti sauce on himself.
Thanks a lot, fellas.
Ames, super important question.
Which one of these shirts should I wear to dinner - with your mom tonight?
- Those are exactly the same.
I have a signature look, Rosa.
Put on a T-shirt for all I care.
It doesn't matter what you wear.
Of course it matters.
He has to wear the smaller checks.
Big checks wash him out.
Where are you, Amy?
It doesn't matter, because the night is already ruined.
My stupid mother invited my stupid brother David to join us.
I thought you liked your brothers.
I have seven brothers, Rosa, and I like all of them except David.
Perfect David.
David graduated at the top of his class at the police academy.
David took a bullet for the mayor.
David bakes his own bread.
Ooh, and does this David have a sister?
- Yes.
Amy is his sister.
- And what's her deal?
You were at the wedding, Hitchcock.
I'm just gonna call and cancel.
I really don't want to have dinner with my mom fawning all over the golden boy.
I'm sure your mom loves you both equally.
No, she definitely doesn't.
My parents arrange the photos of their kids by who makes them the proudest.
Number one goes on the mantel above the fireplace, two through four on the piano, and the rest - are on the staircase.
- This is wack.
- So David's on the mantel?
- Always.
Meanwhile, my picture gathers dust on the piano.
- The piano's not that bad.
- Nobody in the family even plays, Rosa.
At least people use the stairs.
All right, David is perfect, but so are you.
Let's just go tonight, and I'll be your hype man.
You know how good I am at talking you up.
Here, watch.
Hey, Scully.
Did you know that Amy is super cool?
No way.
Can I get your autograph, ma'am?
- See?
- Fine, we'll go.
What, too stuck up for your fans?
Ya friggin' turd!
Hey, Captain, Sarge, I have a case I want to discuss with you.
You want to talk about work in the break room?
That's highly unorthodox, but I suppose we can give it a try.
Okay, so I have a perp I'm sorry, this is insane.
Let's talk in my office.
Much better.
All right, Boyle, what's this case you wanted to talk about?
I have a perp, Alfonso Tucker, transferring into our holding cell.
The guy who was dealing that toxic batch of meth?
Yeah, and he refuses to name his supplier.
I want to send someone into holding, undercover as a perp, to see if they can get him to open up.
Why don't you do it?
You're always going on about your acting abilities and that time you played Annie.
I'm an adult man, Sarge.
I didn't play Annie.
I was in "Annie".
I played Miss Hannigan.
Unfortunately, Alfonso knows I'm a cop, so I can't be Maxwell Blaze.
But Terry might be right for the role.
Ooh, that sounds fun.
I love flexing my creative muscles.
In addition to flexing my actual muscles.
- Or I could do it.
- What?
You hate theater.
You always say acting is just professional lying.
Yes, but this is what the mission calls for, and I'm good at it.
Kevin and I went to a dinner party where we played the French parlor game "charades".
I had to act out Elvis Presley.
He's dead now, so I portrayed him as such.
Everyone understood  Immediately.
You know, a little competition might bring out the best in both of you.
We'll hold auditions this afternoon.
I'll prepare sides.
Please wear clothes you can move in.
Okay, let's get to the table before David gets here.
My mother loves an early bird.
Hey, babe, before we go in, I know I said I was gonna do the whole hype man thing, but I know.
I shouldn't compare myself to my brother.
We're all on our own journey.
What?
No.
Who told you that garbage?
I was gonna say, we need a backup plan so you can win this thing.
If it starts slipping away, I'll pretend to choke, and then you give me the Heimlich and save my life in front of everyone.
Aw, thanks for not trying to make me a better person.
- I love you.
- Love you too.
Amy, Jake!
David and I both arrived an hour early.
We're sharing a French onion.
Mother So she's about to jump, and I say, "Hey, I can't tell you this world is a good place, but I guarantee you it's better with you in it".
And she climbs down off the ledge, - and she gives me a big hug.
- Ugh.
And that was before she won the Oscar?
I don't know, I don't really follow pop culture.
You never cease to impress me, David.
Hey, speaking of impressive, Amy just went to the NYPD shooting range and received a gold certification in marksmanship.
Oh, I just got the platinum certification.
What?
That exists?
What did you do, curve the bullets, "Wanted"-style?
Yeah, I don't know what "Wanted" is.
I don't follow pop culture.
But I fired ten shots, and they all went into the same hole.
Oh, so you actually did.
Hey, Camila, did you know that Amy is the youngest female sergeant in the history of the Nine-Nine?
Yes, I'm very proud of her.
I'm proud of all my children.
The sergeant and the lieutenant.
What?
You passed the lieutenant's exam?
It actually wasn't something I was planning on taking, but then my partner got sick and I wanted to be able to send home extra money to his wife and kids.
Then I read the MRI.
He was totally misdiagnosed.
So long story short, Bo is alive, and I got a perfect score on the test for no reason.
Oh, man.
Hey, check out these dinner rolls, huh?
Love these bad boys.
I'm just gonna chomp down on that, recklessly.
Oh!
Oh, no, Jake!
He's choking!
Let David do it.
He has EMT training.
- I'm here for you, Jake.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
You know what Don't worry.
It is gonna hurt like hell.
I think it's actually okay.
Thank you both so much for coming in.
This is a safe space where choices are welcome.
Okay, now, I trust that both of you had a chance to review the script?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Now throw them away!
What the hell?
I wrote notes in the margin.
Terry found his super-objective.
I want to see you improvise without the safety net.
I want to see you become Maxwell Blaze.
So, Maxwell, what was your childhood like?
I was a lookout at 8, had my own corner at 10, trigger man at 13.
You know what it's like to look a man in his eyes as the life drains out of him?
I was bad from a young age.
At school, I pushed people.
And this wasn't horseplay.
This was pushing to hurt.
Do you have a girlfriend at home?
Used to.
She got tired of me getting locked up.
She's with my brother now.
He better hope I never find his ass.
I do, and you should see her heavy, feminine breasts, with their perfectly placed nipples.
Don't get me started on her can.
- What's your greatest fear?
- I ain't scared of nothing.
My girlfriend.
I'm scared she'll find out about my mistress, who also has a perfect can.
It's smaller, but it's harder.
Great.
You both have given me something totally different.
I've got a lot to think about.
Thank you.
Next!
What up, dawgs?
Norm Scully, reading for Maxwell Blaze.
Listen, I just did what anyone would do.
Hey, where'd you go?
I just couldn't stand there while the whole restaurant gushed over David saving your life.
Yeah, there was a standing ovation.
Also, everyone saw you walk away while I was choking, and I don't want to say you're a villain now, but the B-word was tossed around a lot.
Ugh.
I'm sorry.
I just can't be around him.
- I shouldn't have come.
- So let's leave.
I'll tell everyone my stomach hurts, which it does.
I'm pretty sure he broke my rib when he gave me the Heimlich.
Lieutenant Santiago, a word?
Why is David's captain here?
What's going on?
Is there a maniac on the loose, and David's the only one who can catch him before he blows up a train?
Oh, we could call him the Trainiac.
We're focused on the same things.
Sorry, folks, we've discovered a large quantity of cocaine in Lieutenant Santiago's desk.
We've had to place him under arrest.
Oh, no.
Of course.
We'll head over soon.
So that was my brother.
He needs me to bail him out of jail.
I feel so awful for him.
You are smiling so much.
No, no, I promise.
I feel so, so, bad.
Rosa D!
- Deezer, what up?
- Deezer?
Hey, Scully, did you do something new with your hair?
Same thing as always: put mousse in it while it's wet, then I watch a scary movie.
-  You the man.
- What is wrong with her?
Her brother David got arrested.
- He's a cokehead!
- And you're happy about this?
That's savage.
I love it.
- I'm not happy about it!
- All right.
Calm down, Littlefinger.
He's in a lot of trouble, you know.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right.
It's a terrible situation.
- Let's go bail him out.
- All right.
Ooh, should I get my hair blown out first?
I'm gonna have pictures from today for the rest of my life.
Are you a bad person?
Casting's up!
This is not a high school play, Boyle.
Just let us know who you went with.
Okay, first of all, I want to say that this was one of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make.
There is so much talent in this room.
Just tell us, bitch.
Act as if you already have the role.
I could have cast any one of you and put on a great show, but I had to make a call.
Enough, Boyle.
We're all adults.
No one cares about this that much.
- It's Captain Holt.
- Captain Holt?
He was the worst one!
No offense, but Holt was so unconvincing.
He kept referring to his childhood as a soot-covered street urchin.
Yes, I gave myself a Dickensian backstory, which apparently made quite the impression.
I'm sorry, Sarge.
Honestly, I don't think I'm the right director to bring your vision of Maxwell Blaze to life.
What does that even mean?
It means you blew it.
Walk away, Jeffords.
Walk away.
Okay, this is gonna be my mantel shot.
So every time Mom and Dad look at it, they'll be reminded of what David did.
I would say you should chill out, but this is actually making me feel great about my family, so let's dive in.
Everybody say "possession with intent to distribute"!
Hey.
- Oh!
- Ah, David, hi there.
That was unrelated to your recent arrest for possession with intent to distribute.
- How are you?
- Not great.
Yeah, jail is rough.
You got to go poop in front of everyone.
I remember when I was in prison, I held it for weeks, and when I finally did go, it was You know what, Jake?
This isn't about you.
So, David, did you get fired, or is there gonna be, like, a hearing?
She's asking so she can be there to support you.
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.
- I'm so excited.
- To support you.
That's what I said.
I'm really looking forward - to being there.
- To support you.
Yeah, we're saying the same thing.
- I am pumped this is happening.
- All right, babe, maybe your brother doesn't want to talk about what happened.
- Let's just go.
- It's okay.
I owe you guys an explanation.
I actually started doing drugs when I was a teenager.
You know how Mom and Dad put so much pressure on us?
Eventually I just kind of cracked.
Wait, you felt pressure?
You always seemed to effortlessly thrive at everything.
I was so jealous.
But knowing that you also felt the pressure All right, we can drop the act.
I just didn't know who was listening.
- What act, now?
- Everything I've said before just now is a lie.
I'm being framed.
I've been investigating these dirty cops who are being paid off by the Brazilian mob.
Oh, Brazilian mobsters are so good-looking.
They're just a bunch of Giseles, the women and the men.
Yes, it's insane.
They're all gorgeous.
Anyway, I think I got too close.
Those dirty cops must have planted the drugs in my desk.
So what you're saying is, you're not addicted to cocaine?
Amy, it's me.
I don't even drink coffee.
I have too much respect for my body.
This is water.
And you didn't feel pressure - from Mom and Dad?
- No, they're so supportive.
I'd actually love some constructive criticism.
It's the only way to grow.
Anyway, thank you so much for bailing me out.
If you can just drop me off at home, I will clear my name, and things can go back to the way they were.
The way they were.
Great.
It's my favorite way of things being.
Okay, Alfonso, I hope you like it here in holding.
It's gonna be a while.
So - what they got you in here for?
- Drugs.
They want me to flip, but I'm no snitch.
I'd rather do the time.
How about you?
I pushed a man, just to see him frown.
He is terrible.
Yeah, it's almost like casting a robotic old nerd was a huge mistake.
Was it a mistake, Sarge?
Or was it a stroke of brilliance?
- What are you talking about?
- Look, you're a good actor.
You could even be a great one.
But you're too gentle.
Life hasn't kicked you around enough.
I mean, I grew up poor, and my father was emotionally abusive.
It's not enough.
You needed to be rejected by me, a man you admire so much.
What?
So all this was just to make me mad?
I need you to feel the anger and resentment that Tyrone McCallister feels every single day of his life.
Who's Tyrone McCallister?
You are.
That's the part I wrote for you all along.
This is so stupid, Boyle.
You can't manipulate somebody like this and then expect them to get on board.
Right, Sarge?
Sarge?
My name's Tyrone.
Tyrone McGallagher.
- McCallister.
- McCallister.
So I checked up on David's case file.
He passed his drug test.
Apparently he has the cleanest blood they've ever seen.
I knew this was all too good to be true.
Now David's gonna clear his name and singlehandedly take down drug dealers and dirty cops and get another medal from the governor.
It sounds pretty dangerous.
Maybe we should help him.
Pretty sure he can handle this on his own.
That's never been a problem for him.
All right, look, Ames.
I never had a brother, but I know four guys who did, and they would have fights and squabbles, but in the end, they always had each other's shells.
Are you talking about the Ninja Turtles?
Of course I'm talking about - the Ninja Turtles!
- Ugh.
Look, if something happens to your brother, you are gonna regret it, just like Raph regretted it when he abandoned Leo in the Technodrome with Krang.
I don't know what that means.
Well, that's on you.
It's a classic.
The point is, if your brother gets hurt and you don't get his back now, it's gonna haunt you for the rest of your life.
You're right.
- Obviously you're right.
- Thank you.
If David gets killed by the Brazilian mafia, my parents' mantel is gonna become, like, - a permanent shrine to him.
- No, that's not what I meant.
Oh, the thought of it makes me want to puke.
You've learned the wrong lesson.
Come on, let's go help the bastard.
Don't love how we got here, but we're going where I want.
I'm glad you guys are here.
So this place is run by the Brazilian mob.
My CI tells me there's a ledger with all the cops on payroll hidden in here somewhere.
I'm guessing it's in that room surrounded by armed guards.
Those are guards?
I thought they were models.
We need a plan to get past them.
So here's what I'm thinking.
I speak a little Portuguese from that time I opened a school in the favelas of Rio.
- Ugh, barf.
- What?
I said barf.
I can't deal with your bragging anymore.
How is that bragging?
I said I speak a little Portuguese when I'm actually fluent.
Ugh, shut up!
Look, if you're so angry with me, why are you even here?
Because Jake convinced me if you die, I'd never hear the end of it from Mom and Dad.
That's not exactly how I phrased it.
Look, I get it.
You're jealous.
I'd be jealous too if someone was better than me at everything their whole life.
- Oh, no.
-  Not everything.
- I have more allergies than you.
- Not the best brag.
I have so many allergies, I just found out - I'm allergic to chia seeds.
- But apparently effective.
I'm allergic to chia and acai berries.
Yeah?
My throat gets scratchy when I eat stone fruit.
Oh, yeah?
I'm also a better dancer than you.
Ames, you have badly misjudged your own abilities.
You think you're better than me?
Oh, damn.
She's got a shot.
What, afraid to use your forearms?
Pretty good.
You're not using enough elbow!
Guys, those aren't the parts people feature when they dance.
Now can we please find a way to distract those guards?
Don't worry, Jake, 'cause I'm about to end this thing.
Death drop!
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh, that looked really bad.
- Are you okay?
Oh, look, the guards are leaving their post.
Looks like they're coming here to help you.
Jake, you should go now.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm "fone".
Oh, well, as long as you're "fone".
- Jake, go.
- All right, fine.
Believe me, they're perfect.
They're about 5 1/2 pounds each, and they look so good smushed together.
Or dangling.
Get off me, man.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Cops, man.
- Mm-hmm.
- Word.
McCallister, your lawyer's here.
- He wants to talk to you.
- Already?
What the hell, man?
I was just getting started.
And yet it felt like forever.
You were playing at Alfonso, not with Alfonso.
What are you doing right now, Sarge?
- Listening to you?
- Yes, listening.
What humans do 95% of the time and Tyrone does, apparently, none of the time.
I want you to go back in there and listen.
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah, okay, jeez.
I mean, you know, look, take the note about Tyrone or don't.
What do I know?
But also, I created him.
Hey.
McCallister, your lawyer has more questions for you.
- What?
- Why were you doing that?
You said I should listen!
Well, listening doesn't always mean being quiet.
Sometimes, the only way to listen is to say something.
I'm listening to you right now.
Do you see how I listen?
This is me listening.
You're pissing me off, Boyle!
Ah, and he's back!
Hold on to that aggression.
Yeah, go!
Go, go, go!
What are you looking at?
McCallister.
Terry, Terry, Terry.
I need you to help me see what I'm not seeing.
Why can't you do this?
You're giving me too many notes.
Okay, well, then I can boil it down for you into one note: Tyrone is an ocean.
I don't know what that means.
It means I want you to be tough but vulnerable, brave but scared, jittery but perfectly still.
Also, pace it up a little.
Come on, buddy, you got this.
Man, these stupid cops won't leave me alone.
What the hell?
They think I'm a snitch?
- Not me.
- I hear that.
McCallister, I need to talk to you.
- No!
- Excuse me?
I don't want any more notes.
I've gone undercover before.
Now just back off and let me do this!
Uh-oh, Alfonso, seems as though we got a pig in our midst.
Looks like we can only trust each other.
Come on, man, you're obviously a cop too.
You keep talking about how nefarious you are.
Jake, let us in!
I think she's gonna be okay, but she's probably got a low-grade concussion.
I wish you hadn't tried to do a death drop.
The ladies on "Drag Race" make it look so easy.
I know, you don't get that reference because - you don't have a television.
- Why?
Amy, I'm sorry for getting so competitive back there.
You guys are helping me out, and I should just be grateful.
Of course you're being nice to me when I'm being a monster.
Well, you know what, Mr. Perfect?
I'm gonna find that ledger, and I'm gonna save your stupid butt.
- That would be so great.
- Please stop.
- Maybe there's a hidden panel somewhere?
- It's not in the desk.
I bet it's in this old safe.
That seems like a lot of work to open every time you have to pay a bribe.
I would keep it in this filing cabinet.
I found it!
I beat the golden boy!
I'm the golden girl!
-  - Hey, open up!
- Who's in there?
- Okay, everybody out.
Go!
Go, go, go!
Hey, get off me!
My God, you're even more stunning up close.
I called for backup, but it could take ten minutes.
- Should we storm the place?
- Too late.
Look, they're bringing Jake out.
I told you, I was in the office because I work there, and we've actually met a bunch of times, and it's crazy you don't remember me!
What should we do?
If they get away, we'll never be able to track them.
Shoot out the tires.
You're a way better shot than me.
- You should do it.
- Are you crazy?
- You're the golden girl.
- David, take the shot.
I just don't want you to feel bad about yourself Take the shot!
You're under arrest, you beautiful man.
Cuff this son of a bitch.
Oh, my God, you also smell so good.
Brazil!
All right, so first things first, I think I owe you both something, and it's this.
Stop clapping!
There's nothing to clap about.
Look, I know you're upset, but everything went great.
Great?
You ruined this mission.
Yeah, we might have gotten him to talk if you didn't give me notes every two seconds.
Guys, you performed exactly the way I expected you to.
It's just that you were both supporting characters.
Hey, Boyle, I did what you asked.
Alfonso told me everything.
Yes!
I knew it would work.
What?
What's going on?
You were never my real star, Sarge.
But I needed to create a scene so that Alfonso would think that my mission had failed.
Then I could send in Ricki Sheetz, DJ by night, gun smuggler by later night.
Alfonso started telling me about all the crazy crap you guys pulled in there.
He just couldn't stop talking till he gave me the name of his supplier.
Rosa was my leading lady from the start.
- She's the only good actor here.
- She is?
Yeah, you know nothing about my real life.
- I'm always acting.
- Well done, Boyle.
You've executed this mission flawlessly.
I'm impressed.
Wait, if you were gonna use Diaz the whole time, why didn't you just tell us that?
Because you two would have given it away with your terrible acting.
No offense, but I can read every emotion you're feeling on your face.
- Can you read this one?
- Actually, yes.
You're trying to be tough, but inside, you're super impressed by what I've accomplished today.
Damn, you're right.
You're good.
Thank you, everyone, for joining me again.
To David.
You're my hero.
And to Amy.
You saved my butt.
You're a great cop and a great sister.
Wow.
That means a lot coming from you.
You've always been a role model for me.
He's everyone's role model.
That's why he's on the mantel.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, I just had to go to the bathroom, like I said.
Oh, great.
I thought you went in there to give yourself a pep talk in the mirror like the girl from the deodorant commercial.
I don't know what you're referring to.
She wants the big promotion, but there's just one problem.
She got skunk pit.
We'll watch it later.
The point is, I came to comfort you.
Aw, thanks, but I actually feel really great.
I've spent my whole life trying to beat David at something, but when you were in danger, I just didn't care anymore.
All I wanted was for you to be okay.
I may never have the mantel, but it doesn't matter, 'cause I have you.
Well, I'm very proud of you, and I also wish you had told me that before you went to the bathroom, because I really roasted your mom back there.
And another thing, you should appreciate Amy more, because she's amazing.
And another thing, when you come to visit us, you don't have to bring your own coffee.
Our coffee is fine.
And another thing, I know enough Spanish to understand what idiota means!
And another thing!
When you say I have an "interesting nose," I know you mean big!
I got lost in it.
There were, like, 35 "another things".
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.
You were defending my honor.
And I'm glad you said something.
So should I go back and apologize to your mom?
Oh, hell no.
We're sneaking out the back.
Oh, thank God.
She is terrifying.
See ya at Thanksgiving, Mrs. Santiago.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
1 So I told Nikolaj, "Who cares if you're bad at skateboarding?
When you grow up, nobody thinks skateboarders are cool".
What's cool is having your own pants.
- Uh-huh.
Sure.
- Jake, you seem distracted.
You're agreeing with everything I say.
We should go on a month-long couples' vacation: - you, Amy, me, and my dad.
- Yeah, yeah, fine, whatever.
And we should get matching hats that say, "Best Bud 1" and "Best Bud 2".
And wear them all the time!
For sure.
Look, Charles, don't look behind you, but I think we're being followed.
I saw this guy when we were leaving the precinct, and he was in line at lunch, and now he's right behind us.
Is it someone you arrested?
I don't recognize him, but judging by the head-to-toe denim, I say he's either not American or deeply American.
I'm thinking Ukraine or Kentucky.
Well, should we call it in?
No.
I've got a better idea.
Hi there.
Who are you, and why are you following me?
I'm not following you.
- I come for Charles Boyle.
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hands where we can see them.
- Chill out, bro!
It's not gun.
It's just uh, it's a toy.
No shoot, pretty please.
It's gift for Nikolaj.
Nikolaj?
How do you know Charles's son?
My name is Gintars.
From Latvia.
I am Nikolaj birth father.
Ohh!
Nikolaj's birth father who I'd never hope to meet.
Very cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, c-c-c-c-c  Charles, are you okay?
You hit your head pretty hard.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I don't have a concussion.
We'll see about that.
How many musical numbers are there in the movie "Zootopia"?
- Oh, just the one.
- Yeah, he's okay.
I don't know what's going on.
How did you find me?
The orphanage isn't supposed to give out that information.
You know Dragomir, Nikolaj brother?
He tell me all about you.
Of course.
You're Dragomir's father too.
No, Dragomir is my brother.
Dragomir and I have same father but different mother.
Her name Anyuta.
Together we have baby.
That baby's Nikolaj.
Dragomir is brother of Nikolaj.
I am brother of Dragomir.
Also stepfather.
We are contemporary blended family.
Would make very good TV show.
Honestly, that does sound very interesting and good.
Anyways, I was too young and poor to have child, but now I'm very successful businessman.
I have my own clothing line.
Maybe you've heard of it: The Gape.
We also have Baby Gape and the Gape Body.
- Oh, you mean The Gap?
- No, no, Gape.
Like, there are two things and there's space between.
Yeah, like, The Gap.
Like, The Gap.
The company that already exists.
I don't know what you're saying.
I never heard of it.
But is it a knock-off of Gape?
Do they sell clothing?
So what?
You have money now, and you're just gonna take Nikolaj back?
No, no, I don't want to take boy from you.
I just want to meet him one time.
Look, I know it's lot to ask, but, please.
Nikolaj is my sex result.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I walk your sex result to school every morning.
No, don't use his words.
I help your sex result with his homework.
This is bad, even for you.
I sing your sex result a lullaby every night.
- I wanna do something.
- You will never meet my son.
Oh, yeah?
Well, then I don't leave America until I meet the boy.
And I come from white country.
I have very long visa.
Very long.
So I'm positive the murder happened inside this apartment, but CSI could find no traces of blood.
I'd like to ask the FBI to bring in a team of lab techs.
This would require Commissioner Kelly signing off.
Before I make that ask, is there anything else we can do?
Um, I'm pretty sure there is.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I am now.
We need Yee!
Who?
Isn't it that guy that led that seminar where you guys turned Boyle into a mummy, and then you pushed him down the stairs?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Rosa.
Easy.
No one pushed Boyle down the stairs.
Right.
We may have plastered his eyes shut and left him to wander around blindly, but he fell down on his own.
- It was a classic accident.
- Exactly.
Anyway, Dr. Yee is a genius in the field of forensic entomology.
They call him "Father Fly".
- How cool is that?
- 0%.
How are insects gonna help us?
There weren't any in or around the boy.
Oh, my God.
You still think forensic entomology is all blow flies - and screw worms, don't you?
-     That's a good one, Santiago.
You should take the Lieutenant's exam.
- Hey.
- Dr. Yee has recently bred a species of fly that has increased sensitivities to certain human proteins.
They can detect trace amounts of blood, even if it's been cleaned with bleach.
Or masked with animal urine.
Oh, I was building to that.
- Thanks for stealing my thunder.
- This is nasty.
Terry hates bugs.
Too many eyes and legs.
Would you still hate bugs if I told you that there were thousands of tiny mites that live in your eyebrows and keep them from being weighed down - by oils?
- Yes!
Look, I really think we should go with the feds on this.
No, we're bringing in Yee.
I'll make the call right now.
- Oh, can I listen on speaker?
- Mm.
Oh, my God.
It's gonna be a long couple of days.
You're telling me.
I got bugs in my brows, Rosa.
Hey.
So what's your plan with Gintars?
He's kind of taking over the whole waiting area.
No, don't worry about me.
I'm watching "Mad About You" on Latvian Hulu.
It's very funny show.
Very many episodes.
I could sit here all day.
I don't know what to do.
He's never gonna leave.
But I'm scared for Nikolaj to get to know him.
Okay, how about this?
Gintars just wants to see him, right?
We can maybe have them meet without telling Nikolaj that Gintars is his birth father.
Just say he's an old friend of ours.
Jake, you're completely forgetting about the olfactory bond.
Nikolaj will immediately recognize his father's scent.
Well, you got to do something, and I don't think you're gonna wait this guy out.
Paul and Jamie are locked in the bathroom.
But Jamie has a turkey in the oven.
This is a very good setup.
- And they pay it off.
- It's so good.
Okay, Jake, let's give your plan a shot.
Okay, Gintars, remember the deal is, you cannot tell Nikolaj you're his father.
Who Gintars?
I'm Billy Hanukkah.
I'm from the Bronx, Manhattan.
I eat pizza at Famous Ray's.
Okay, well, no need to get too specific or offer up any backstory.
Hey, guys.
I'm just coming from work with my friend Billy Hanukkah.
- Hanukkah.
- It's fine.
Kids don't know which names are weird.
Nikolaj, say hi to Jake and this stranger.
Hi, Jake.
I love you.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hanukkah.
I love you too.
Man, he really is a Boyle, isn't he?
Hello, my little friend.
Did you have good day at school?
- We had computer class today.
- I am your real father!
My name is Gintars.
- You are my son.
- What?
Well.
That backfired real quick.
Daddy, why is the man saying he's my father?
Mr. Hanukkah is crazy.
He has no children of his own, and it's driven him mad.
I'm your father, Nikolaj.
- It's pronounced Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- Nikolaj.
- It's okay.
You say it wrong.
-  Okay, well, that was fun.
Hey, why don't you go play over there, buddy?
You can take this drug store receipt.
It's very long and filled with coupons.
You can fly it around like a kite.
Whee!
Wow, kids are really basic.
Is being a dad super easy?
What the hell was that?
You promised you wouldn't tell him.
So sorry.
I smelled my boy.
I don't know what came over me.
Please.
I'm in town for 10 more days.
Let Nikolaj know I exist.
Let me spend time with him.
I could take him to Russian bathhouse.
- Has he been?
- No!
I'm not some weirdo that takes my eight-year-old to the Russian bath!
We take our baths at home together as a family like normal people!
Not sure you have the upper hand on that storm-off, Boyle.
He's here!
Dr. Yee's on his way up.
How's my breath?
Perfect.
Yee's gonna love it.
This is not a good color on you guys.
Speaking of bad looks, Sarge, what is going on with your eyebrows, man?
I shaved them off.
'Cause of the bugs.
Sharon said you couldn't notice.
Sharon lied, Terry.
You look like a straight-up fool.
Damn, Rosa.
No, Diaz is right.
Your face is horrifying.
You should leave before Hello, Dr. Yee!
Out back now.
Captain Holt, nice to see you again.
Please, call me Raymond.
Unless that feels weird.
You don't have to.
I'll answer to anything.
Raymond works.
So I understand you have a potential crime scene, and you'd like to find some blood.
Well, I've brought along several hundred of my best detectives to help out.
Oh, my God.
I'm starstruck.
We all are.
So what you made you think of using drosophila as a method of searching for blood traces?
Have you ever read Sung Tz'u's textbook - "The Washing Away of Wrongs" from 1235?
- Nope.
- Yes.
- Which edition?
It tells the story of the first known use of forensic entomology.
A farmer was slashed to death.
A local judge asked everyone in the town to lay down their sickles.
And though they all appeared clean, one attracted a horde of flies.
The insects could sense the blood, even though it was invisible to the human eye.
Wow, what an arresting story.
Yes, they did arrest him.
We made a joke together.
Okay, Dr. Yee, how effective is your box of bugs?
Oh, well, in a lab, they've detected blood even when it's been cleaned with bleach.
Or covered with animal urine!
You two really know your stuff.
I know that sound.
That's the moaning of a man who left his lunch on the bus.
I didn't lose my lunch, you idiot.
I lost my son!
Okay, Scully, I got this.
Hey there, bud.
I got you your favorite tea: - duck broth.
- Thanks.
You know me so well.
But I'm too sad to drink duck broth.
Wow, I never thought I'd hear you or anyone say that.
Nikolaj is asking if Gintars is really his dad.
I worked so hard to have him think of me as his father.
And now it's all ruined.
He'll probably go back to calling me what he did when I first adopted him: Mr. America.
I know you're upset, but that is a dope nickname.
I'm not Mr. America.
- I'm Daddy.
- Of course you are.
I just don't want Nikolaj to see him again.
I don't want him turning into a Gintars.
You have nothing to worry about.
Nikolaj is already a mini Charles.
He's an eight-year-old boy whose favorite movie is "Bullets Over Broadway".
So what are you saying?
I should let him spend time with Gintars?
I just worry that if you prevent him from knowing his birth father, that he'll build up some fantasy of him and then blame you for keeping them apart.
That's crazy.
The way that King Trident kept Ariel from exploring the surface.
Oh, my God, you're right.
I'm driving Nikolaj into the arms of a sea witch.
Watching him work is amazing.
Mm-hmm.
- I have to get a video.
- Santiago, please.
Hold the phone horizontal to get more flies in frame.
All right, guys, this fanboy stuff is a little much.
The only thing that's a little much over here are your scrawled-on eyebrows.
- Yeesh.
- Seriously?
- I thought they worked.
- They do if you wanna look like a mean drag queen.
I knew I should have done a flatter arch.
This is a nighttime look.
Well, the flies are not reacting.
I can keep going, but I'll tell you now, it's very unlikely there are any traces of blood in here.
Well, according to my timeline, this is the only place the murder could have happened.
Sorry, Rosa, looks like your timeline's wrong.
Because the flies don't lie.
You can use that if you want.
He's not gonna use a cheeky slogan.
- He's a man of science.
- I like it.
The flies don't lie.
Okay, Dr. Yee, exactly how accurate is this technology?
Diaz, how dare you question the man.
Dr. Yee has spent millions of dollars developing and researching these flies.
It's fine.
Would you all like to see what happens when they actually sense blood?
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.
Will you hold this, Ally?
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, Detective Diaz, I know it's upsetting when a hunch doesn't pan out.
Well, it's over.
The flies have it.
Keep your eyes on the flies.
Flies don't lie.
Now, that's a good one.
Oh, no, it's Santiago's.
Damn it.
Wow, this was a bad idea.
Relax.
He gets one afternoon with Nikolaj, and he chooses basketball?
Does Nikolaj even like basketball?
He loves the "Get Your Head In The Game" number from "High School Musical".
I haven't seen it, but I know that's not the same.
Look at them.
Does it seem like he's actually enjoying this?
Porzingas!
Charles, can I tell you a story?
- Always.
- All right.
When I was 10, my dad started dating this woman, Leeza.
My mom hated her.
But my dad wanted us to bond, so one day he took me and Leeza to the mall and dropped us off.
She proceeds to steal a ton of blouses from Ann Taylor and then immediately makes me go back in and exchange them for store credit.
Then to celebrate, I get to pull Leeza's Cinnabon apart because her nails are too long and curly to do it herself.
- Ugh.
- Point being, nothing has ever made me love my own mother more than the time I spent with Leeza.
Gintars is Leeza.
You are my mom.
I can't believe I get to be Karen.
What an honor!
- Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, sweetie?
- Can we leave?
- Oh, no, so soon?
But I understand.
We can go home right now.
No, not home.
Daddy Gintars wants to buy me a jean jacket just like his.
Daddy Gintars.
Daddy Gintars.
Oh, no.
I am Leeza.
Wait.
No.
That's not right.
Hey, bud.
Everything going okay in here?
I know you're going through something, but people are starting to complain about the moaning.
Ugh.
I would give anything to have Gintars gone and out of Nikolaj's life.
But it's not gonna happen.
Okay, well, I'm just gonna close the door, then.
And you can feel free to moan as much as you need.
This is bad.
I know.
He's been like that all day.
No, I was talking about your eyebrows.
Whatever's going on up there is real, real bad.
Well, it's better than having two bug hotels above your eyes.
But wouldn't they also be in your goatee?
- Don't do this to me, Jake.
- Wait a minute.
I may have just thought of a way to get rid of Gintars.
Do you still have that friend who works on the Counterfeiting Taskforce?
Yeah, why?
Gintars has this terrible knock-off clothing brand called The Gape.
If I can get him to admit on tape that he's selling counterfeit goods, they would terminate his visa and deport him.
Deport him?
Doesn't that seem a little extreme?
Yeah, definitely, but Charles just said he'd give anything for Gintars to be gone.
- He's not doing great, Terry.
- Okay.
But how are you gonna get Gintars on tape?
Good question, Sergeant Crazy Brows.
Gintars is always talking about the Russian baths.
I'll see if he'll meet me there and then ask him to cut me in on his business.
Meanwhile, I'll have a mic hidden underneath my towel.
It's foolproof.
Before we do deal, we take off towel.
It's full naked.
Ha.
What are you waiting for?
I want to see where your hair starts and stops.
Gintars.
-  - Take it off now.
Heh.
Hey, Sarge.
Holy crap.
What the hell is that?
That is a bug-free zone is what it is.
I bleached it.
I'm smarter than they are, Rosa.
Uh-huh.
What about your nose hair?
Oh, man.
Terry forgot about his nose.
Hey, why is Yee still here?
Holt wants him to hand in his case report in person.
I think he's trying to trick him into going to lunch with him.
Wait.
It's noon?
If I didn't know better, I'd say that was lunchtime.
I hope they take that container of bugs with them - when they go.
- Wait.
The container's here?
I have an idea.
All I need is some blood.
This is fresh.
Oh.
Terrible, yet perfect.
Stupid bugs didn't do anything.
He lied to us, Sarge.
Huh?
Why's your towel still on?
This is business conversation.
You cannot trust a man who cannot show you his full self.
Well, not in America.
Here we have business meetings fully clothed.
Sometimes even in a suit and tie.
Have you ever seen the show "Shark Tank"?
Latvian "Shark Tank" is all nude.
That sounds weirdly sexy.
No, not at all.
There's no female sharks, so it's just four Mr. Wonderfuls naked on a big leather couch.
Huh.
Not what I imagined.
Hey, listen.
I would love to buy some of that knock-off denim.
Okay, first of all, it's not knock-off.
Okay, Gape is true, authentic brand.
The real thief is Gap.
- Are they?
- What makes more sense?
That they take Gape and remove letter?
Or that I take Gap and add pricey E?
I don't care if it's fake, I just wanna buy some.
It's not fake; you are still wearing a towel; and this deal: over.
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you wanna know why I won't take off my towel?
It's because I'm embarrassed about what's underneath.
Mutilated penis?
Ye p. That is it.
You guessed it on the first try.
That's what's under there.
The old the old mute peen.
I am so sorry about your penis.
It's a bummer.
But we all have things that bring us shame.
Remember when I told you before that Gape was original, authentic brand?
I do.
It was just now.
Yeah, well I stole the whole thing from Gap.
And here I was completely believing you when you told me you didn't.
Wow.
Well, thank you for sharing that with me.
You are freak.
But I support you.
Come.
Oh, no, it's a naked hug.
Ha ha.
Ah.
Hey, what's up?
You guys having a little coffee?
That's cool.
- Yee's a fraud.
- What?
Excuse me?
Those nasty-ass bugs don't smell blood.
And they must not smell bullcrap, either, 'cause he's spewing it everywhere.
What are you saying out of your weird face?
We put the flies near fresh blood, and nothing happened.
They didn't react at all.
Do you know how stupid these accusations sound?
- Diaz, you're fired.
- What?
Dr. Yee is one of the most respected forensic experts in the country.
For you two let's not mince words common fools to suggest that you found the flaw - in this brilliant man's - They're right.
- What?
- Huh?
The flies don't sense blood.
They're just regular flies.
But, Dr. Yee, you can't be a fraud.
You gave a TED Talk.
I spent $6 million in federal grant money on this experiment and I've gotten nowhere.
The closest I ever came was when they all landed on a Popsicle once.
But in the apartment we saw them react to a cotton swab - dipped in blood.
- It was melted Popsicle.
-  - Jam works, too, but it's more expensive.
So, Sir, you were saying something about us being common fools?
So who looks stupid now?
Uh, Terry, your left eyebrow is missing.
Oh, I must have rubbed it off.
There it is.
Who looks stupid now?
Jake, hey, I got it, man.
Nice jeans, and the good thing is look both legs, same length.
Thank you very much.
And I see it's 100% denim-ish.
"Caution: Do not wear near women who are pregnant - or breast-feeding".
- This is true.
The nipple may fall off.
Hey, guys.
Gintars said to meet him here.
I didn't realize you were coming.
My man, I'ma wrestle you.
Come here.
Charles, what are you doing here?
Why is Nikolaj here?
Oh, he's been so happy since he met Gintars.
I've been focusing on myself and not really thinking about Nikolaj.
- Mm-hmm.
- I didn't realize how much it meant to him to know he hadn't been abandoned.
I'm okay with them having a relationship.
Wow, that is so great of you, Charles, but I really wish you'd included me in your decision-making process.
- Why?
- No reason.
I just maybe went in a different, less-mature direction.
Hey, maybe we should leave this area, like, right now.
Cop car.
How's it going?
Hey, man.
Gintars Irbe, you're under arrest for selling counterfeit goods.
Jake!
You set me up.
Do you even have mutilated penis?
No.
It's perfect.
Okay.
So they're taking Gintars to the airport and they're not hurting him any more than they did when he was resisting arrest.
-  -  Now they won't let him go just because I asked them to even though they arrested him just because I asked them to.
It's a crazy system.
I don't understand it.
But here's what I'm thinking: - I call the State Department - You've done enough, Jake.
That's nice of you to say, but - My tone wasn't nice.
- But your tone is always nice with me.
Wait a minute.
Are you mad?
Yes, because you butted into a situation you shouldn't have.
You need to keep your butt in your pants.
My butt was only out because you said you wanted Gintars gone.
Well, thanks to your butt, Nikolaj feels like he's been abandoned all over again.
Okay, but my butt was the one that got them together in the first place.
I don't feel like my butt is getting credit for that.
Well, that's because your butt was inappropriate then too.
Your butt should have never been a part of this.
So now I gotta go clean up the big nasty mess that your butt made.
But my butt no but My butt no but!
Diaz, Jeffords, Santiago would like to apologize to you for her behavior.
I thought we were both apologizing.
No, I misunderstood.
What would I be apologizing for?
- The same thing as me?
- Really?
You guys maybe want to have this conversation on your own?
Yes.
- - Okay, we have come to a decision that we would both like to apologize.
We should have trusted your instincts over Dr. Yee and his flies.
And?
And we shouldn't have been so insulting.
And?
I'm not gonna apologize for your face.
That mess is clearly on you.
- Fair enough.
- I'll ask Commissioner Kelly to approve your initial request for an FBI lab team.
That won't be necessary.
I solved the case.
And the flies actually came in handy.
These have been genetically engineered to detect blood, and there's a whole swarm of them at your apartment right now with Dr. Ronald Yee.
The flies don't lie.
- He confessed immediately.
- How about that.
Dr. Yee and his flies saved the day after all.
No, I did.
Should we call Yee and tell him the good news?
It would probably make him feel so much better.
- What is going on?
- He did seem so sad.
- So sad.
- He should be sad.
He's a fraud.
Shh.
It's ringing.
Hey.
Hey.
Did you make it to the airport in time to see Gintars?
Yes, but TSA wouldn't let him stay in the country.
At least Nikolaj got to spend a few hours with his birth father at a Chili's Too.
Chili's As Well.
Listen, I feel bad, and I wanted to do something but I know you didn't want my help, so long story short, I made us these hats.
I obviously love them.
They don't change how I'm feeling.
Okay.
Well, I'm sorry that I messed things up.
But I was just trying to be a good friend.
I know, but that doesn't always mean fixing my life.
You shouldn't have done anything without asking me.
Sometimes I just want you to listen.
Right.
I hear that.
It's just adoption is complicated.
No matter how much I want to be, I'm not Nikolaj's real father.
Come on, Charles.
Of course you are.
Well, that'll be up to him.
And he may even change his mind about it throughout his life.
I mean, all I can do is make him feel safe and give him as much love as I can.
Well, I think Nikolaj is very lucky to have you.
- Nikolaj.
-  Okay.
Let's take these hats out for a spin.
I've waited long enough.
Here you go.
Best Bud #1.
You'd rather be Best Bud #2?
I just want you to listen a little more.
I don't wanna change our whole dynamic.
Okay, good, 'cause I really wanted to be Best Bud #1.
- I know you did.
-  Clink!
- Oh, they're way too small.
- Ooh, they're tight.
- They're way too small.
- Hurt.
They don't fit.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
1 Bottles.
Boyle.
Bullpen.
- What are you - Buh-buh-buh.
Bottles, Boyle, bullpen.
Bowling.
Behold, Brooklyn buddies, Boyle bullpen bottle bowling.
- Beautiful.
- Be brave, bro.
Be brave.
Bowl!
- Bam!
- Bull's-eye!
Booyah!
Babushka!
Babushka!
Jakey, I've got a hot case for you.
Ooh, hit me.
Okay, Susan Buckley was reported missing by her psychiatrist, Dr. William Tate.
He thinks that her husband James may have had a mental break and done something terrible to her.
Ooh, that is a hot case.
Missing woman, psycho husband, creepy shrink.
Dr. Tate was actually quite a nice man.
Yeah, but you know, he's a psychiatrist, so he's automatically a creep.
I've seen movies.
They all turn into super sophisticated, Chianti-loving cannibals.
Wait, have you never been to therapy?
- No.
Don't need it.
- Not even after the time - your wife shot you?
- Nope.
What about when you were held at gunpoint and had to write your own suicide note?
Oh, that was crazy.
I forgot about that.
Or when you were falsely accused of bank robbery - and went to prison?
- Was that a big deal?
You joined a gang and tried meth!
I didn't want to be anyone's bitch.
Look, it sounds like these things affected you more than they affected me.
Maybe you should go to therapy.
I do.
Terry needs a safe space to process his emotions.
I go twice a week.
Couples counseling with my dad, and then a solo sesh with Dr. Tyler.
Okay, unlike Kooky Charles and Tearful Terry, I am healthy and don't need therapy.
I hear that.
I don't go to therapy either.
Jake and I are like two penises in a pod.
Damn it, Hitchcock, we talked about this.
It never helps when you back me up.
Let's just go, Charles.
-  - Come in, Diaz.
- How'd you know it was me?
- The restrained knock.
Everyone else in this office plays my door like it's a marimba.
The other day, Jeffords gave it three taps - and two raps.
- Was he drunk?
- One can only assume.
- Mm.
Anyway, I wanted to invite you and Jocelyn to dinner at my house this weekend.
Kevin will be making his famous rice.
Thank you for the invite, but I'm not really having people meet Jocelyn yet.
I'm still feeling things out with her.
But Boyle says you brought Jocelyn to Shaw's last week.
That was unplanned.
Sure, but now that the squad has all met her, surely you can't object to her having some rice with Kevin and me?
Okay, it's just that you can be a bit judgmental.
What a stupid thing to say.
Name one time when I have been judgmental.
- Okay.
- What a stupid thing to say.
Oh, I see.
Mere seconds ago.
Sir, Jocelyn is not like us.
- She has feelings.
- Huh.
Are you positive this is the woman for you?
That is exactly the type of thing I don't want you to say in front of her.
Sorry.
It's not gonna happen.
Kevin, they're not coming.
Yes, I know you've already started soaking the rice.
Couldn't we just eat it ourselves?
I understand you purchased four portions of rice.
Yes, that's a great idea.
We'll eat the extra rice for breakfast.
I love you, as well.
Hey, Sarge, a package was delivered to my desk downstairs, addressed to the 99th Precinct, attention: Sergeant, but it's not for me.
It's a book.
Sounds like something you'd order.
"How to Please Your Wife: 100 Tips to Take Your Sex Life from Blah to Ahhhh".
Yeah.
That's not mine.
It also shipped with two gallons of protein powder.
Well, I get my protein from real food.
22 meals a day, 1 every 40 minutes.
It's not a big deal, okay?
Just take the book.
I promise I won't tell anyone.
Hey, Sarge, I heard you need some sex tips.
Except for the people I already told.
Here's the big one: just lie flat on your back.
- Women love to do all the work.
- Ugh.
That's very incorrect, and I don't need sex tips!
Okay, we'll just leave the book here, and whoever did order it can take it when nobody's looking.
It's not mine!
Terry doesn't order books online.
He supports local bookstores.
They're dying, Amy!
Oh, that guy looks like he's wearing a skin mask over his own face, so I'm guessing it's Dr. Tate.
He has a normal man's face, Jake.
Yes, he does have a normal man's face, stretched out over his own face, because he is a Hannibal.
Hi there.
Dr. Tate, I presume.
Yes.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Uh, which one of you is in charge?
- Let the mind games begin.
- Excuse me?
Sorry, I am Detective Peralta.
This is Detective Boyle.
He's in charge.
Dr. Tate, have you heard anything from Mrs. Buckley?
No, I haven't, and I'm quite worried.
I received a frantic, disturbing call from James yesterday.
He was afraid he'd done something horrible.
I asked him where he was, and he said he was in the park near the Zen garden.
I suspected he was just experiencing delusions, but when they didn't show up for therapy today, I became very concerned.
So you think he killed her and dumped her body in the park?
Sounds like couples counseling is going really great for them.
Sorry, my partner doesn't believe in therapy.
Oh, that's fine.
It's hard for some people.
Title of your sex tape.
Are you normally so cavalier around murder investigations?
Yes, we see a lot of darkness in our line of work, and humor is one of our coping mechanisms.
It's self-preservation through disassociation.
What the ?
It's something I've been working on with my therapist.
Well, I act like this because I'm cool and fun and people like being around me.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to trigger you.
Okay, Doc, you're not in your office.
You don't have to use words like "triggered" or "in denial".
I didn't say "in denial".
Are you in denial?
No, I am not, and before you say anything, I don't want to sleep with my mom either.
Now, why would you bring that up unprompted?
What?
You prompted it.
Jake, there's a body over here.
Oh, thank God.
I mean, "Oh, no, death".
I mean I don't want to sleep with my mom, okay?
I know this is the wrong takeaway from this case board, but I really love the new yarn you're using.
- There are sparkles in it.
- I noticed.
Okay, so let's go over what we got.
No witnesses, no weapon.
Bruising indicates a struggle.
No conclusive DNA found at the scene other than from the three of us who found the body.
And our chief suspect, James Buckley, has disappeared.
But he has no motive, no criminal record, and according to his credit card statement, had just purchased two sombreros.
Kind of weird to give someone a sombrero when you're about to murder them.
Well, both sombreros could have been for him.
It's always good to have a backup sombrero.
Please stop pronouncing it like that.
What, pronouncing sombreros - like sombrero?
- Yes.
Fine, if you want me to pronounce it the wrong way.
Look, I think James is a good suspect.
We have Dr. Tate's notebooks, and they specifically mention that he's been having violent fantasies for the last few months.
And you want us to just blindly trust Dr. Tate?
He's a creepy therapist.
They all are.
What kind of profession requires a couch?
Lots of them.
My cousin Pam has a couch in his bird store.
Would you call that creepy?
Yes!
Decidedly so.
You always get upset when I bring up Pam.
Whatever.
Can we please just go check out James's apartment?
Mm-hmm.
Hello, gentlemen.
How is your day going?
Great.
I just woke up from my morning nap.
I mean, my morning nap.
It's fine.
It's good to be rested at work.
Okay.
Are you trying to prove that you can be nonjudgmental?
Rosa, I didn't see you there.
I was just having a friendly chat with my employees.
So, uh, boys, tell me, what are you doing this weekend?
Well, we're going to a sauce launch party at Wing Slutz.
Sounds like a neat cultural event.
They're introducing a new dairy-based sauce called Cream Dream.
Mmm.
And everyone who comes gets a free bucket.
You want to know what that's called?
- Of course I do.
- No, you don't.
None of us do.
You proved your point.
If you want to meet Jocelyn so bad, you can.
You win.
Okay, well, that's Friday night.
Now, every Saturday morning, we go to the public baths.
I get it.
You lead colorful lives.
Let's end this, shall we?
Okay, so the neighbors say they haven't seen or heard any activity in the Buckleys' apartment, and What is he doing here?
If we find James and he's unstable, Dr. Tate could talk him down.
- Hello, Peralta.
- Plus, on the ride over, - he gave me a quickie.
- A what?
A quick therapy session.
We talked about so much.
Did you know that I have a tendency - to be unconsciously sexual?
- Yes.
It's a real tough nut to bust.
Oh, you're doing it again.
Oh, okay, I think I hear it.
- You think you hear it?
- Mm-hmm.
Whatever, let's just do this, okay?
NYPD, open up.
That's weird.
- The door's unlocked.
- That's too bad.
I love watching you pound one out.
- Charles.
- What?
That was sexual?
- Which part?
- All of the parts!
All right, you stay here.
Charles, we're going in.
- Bedroom's clear.
- The kitchen's clear.
Did you see anything suspicious?
Nothing, except for these laughing Jesus paintings everywhere.
- Why is he in front of a tepee?
- I don't know.
The one in the kitchen has him at the last supper, but all the apostles are McDonald's characters.
- Which one's Judas?
-  The Hamburglar.
Knew it as soon as I asked.
You check the bathroom?
- No, where is it?
- It's right over there.
- Clear.
- Cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Well, Dr. Tate, we will meet you back at the car.
We just want to check some things out for one more minute.
- Did you notice that?
- The painting in the bathroom of Jesus standing over a vent with his robe blowing up like Marilyn Monroe?
No.
Dr. Tate is the killer.
- Hey, Santiago.
- Hey.
Can you help me put up these flyers around the office?
Mm-hmm.
"Lost sex book.
Delivered by accident to Sergeant Jeffords, who doesn't need it".
Terry, come on.
Nobody cares about your sex life.
Just take the book home.
Take someone else's book home?
That's stealing and mail fraud.
I can't believe you would even suggest that.
Look, I think it's so great that you've been married so long and want to keep it fresh.
I hope Jake does that for me if our sex life ever takes a dip.
Dip?
Oh, there is no dip.
- Just ask Sharon.
- Oh, no, please.
I don't want to do that.
That's not necessary.
- It's okay.
I believe you.
- Hey, hon.
Yeah, could you tell Amy how good I am in bed?
Because I'm a sex machine who Oh, on speaker?
Oh, hey, girls.
How was school?
Why do you think Dr. Tate's the murderer?
He already knew where the bathroom was.
He's clearly been here before.
Well, he probably just guessed, because it's obvious.
This is New York.
It's never obvious where the bathroom is.
I once had an apartment where the toilet was literally in the refrigerator.
I bet he was sleeping with Susan.
Therapists are always having affairs with their patients.
- That's not true.
- Oh, really?
Tell that to the ten minutes of "Bikini Shrink" I watched on Cinemax when I was 13.
Dr. Juggs was insatiable.
James was ill.
We have months of notes saying he was increasingly unstable.
First of all, people with mental illness are much more likely to be the victims than the perpetrators.
I heard that on NPR when I was in the room - while Amy was listening to NPR.
- Ah.
And second, I bet Dr. Tate's notes are fake.
I mean, you know what was in Dr. Juggs's notes?
- What?
- Stick figures doing it.
- What does that prove?
- I don't know, but it was hot.
All I'm saying is, something feels suspicious to me here.
Maybe we should go to Dr. Tate's office and see if we can find the missing notebooks.
Wait, you're basing this all on the fact that he knew where a bathroom was?
And his DNA was at the scene where we discovered the body.
I bet that's why he insisted on coming with us to the park.
You've been weird about Dr. Tate from the start.
To me, the evidence suggests that James killed his wife and fled.
It's my case, and that's the lead we're following.
Okay.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I was being unfair.
It's your case.
You call in an APB, and I will meet you back at the precinct.
I'm just gonna swing by the bank.
You're not gonna go to Dr. Tate's office and search it behind my back, are you?
What?
Charles, no.
I wouldn't do that.
You can trust me.
- Okay, I trust you.
- Good.
You should.
- Well, I do.
- Great, because you can.
- I feel good about it.
- Good, you should.
I think it's the right choice.
You're making the right call by trusting me.
Not.
"Wayne's World".
Sweet.
All right, think.
Where would I hide the real notebook if I was a creepy therapist?
In my butt.
Focus, Jake.
Now is not the time for being hilarious.
What have we here?
James and Susan Buckley.
So your day's been going well?
- It has, it has.
- They're blocking my way out.
A cancellation, and so I was able to get more work done.
Yeah.
Well, that's always nice.
Same thing happened to me yesterday.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, two cancellations.
You know?
At least it wasn't three.
-  - Have a good afternoon.
- You too.
- Okay.
See you in the morning.
Oh, um, can I help you?
Yes.
I am your new patient.
- Garrett?
- Garrett is my name, yes.
You're an hour and a half early.
I know.
I have problems with time management.
That's the issue I want to talk about.
On the phone, you said you were concerned you might have multiple personality disorder.
Yep, that too.
Got buttloads of peeps living in my brain, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt.
We should talk about it.
I can't believe it's taken so long for us to meet.
You're so nice.
Oh, I don't know about that, Jocelyn.
I'm just being myself.
Well, you're very sweet about the cosmetology thing.
A lot of people are dismissive of hairstylists.
It makes no sense.
If we didn't have hairstylists to cut our hair, our hair would be far too long.
-  - Wow, great compliment.
Hey, you're the girl from the diarrhea commercial, aren't you?
You get diarrhea on the plane.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, move along.
I don't get diarrhea on the plane.
I get diarrhea in the airport.
What's going on?
Are you an actor?
Well, you don't have to sound so grossed out.
I can see why you didn't want him meeting Jocelyn.
- Excuse me?
- This isn't Jocelyn.
It's Sheena.
She's an actress.
Yeah, I was in an episode of "SVU".
I say, "We want answers".
The director tried to replace me, but Mariska said it would take too much time, and then they all agreed I'd probably cut together fine.
Look, Diaz, I've obviously misread our relationship.
You didn't want me to meet the real Jocelyn because we're not as close as I thought we were, so message received.
Hey, so you don't by any chance need any molly, do you?
- I'm a cop.
- And scene.
Now I'm out of character, and I don't sell any drugs.
I am leaving.
So, Garrett, where would you like to begin?
You know what, can we crack the door a little?
I get very claustrophobic, probably from all the different people living in my head.
We usually keep it closed for privacy, but whatever makes you comfortable.
Thank you.
Damn it, he's still here.
- Excuse me?
- Hmm?
Uh, I was just talking to another one of the voices.
- Is it Tatiana?
- Who now?
The mischievous seven-year-old British girl you told me about on the phone?
May I speak with her?
Uh  Yes?
Hello, Doctor.
I'm from Wussex.
Is that an actual place in England?
How should I know?
I'm just a little girl, I am, I am.
Well, it's nice to speak with you, Tatiana.
Can I say hello to Brian, the bookkeeper from Central London?
Cheers, I'm Brian.
I like bookkeeping right in the middle of London.
Did I tell you a full list of my many personalities when I called you on the ol' telly, innit?
Yes, you did.
And are any of 'em, hopefully, not from England?
There's Geoffrey.
You said he's Australian.
Aww, crikey.
Hey, Sarge.
I saw the flyers.
You really put a lot of them up, huh?
I just want to make extra sure we find the real book-buyer.
Do you think it's this kind of overcompensation that's been making things difficult in the bedroom?
Oh, I don't compensate.
I procreate.
Three kids.
Okay.
Weird brag.
Look, just take the book.
Nobody cares.
Hey, I just saw this.
I think you have my book.
Oh, really?
Told ya!
But you're not even married, Scully.
I'm in a committed relationship, and Cindy Shatz says I'm a selfish lover.
All right, well, what about the protein powder?
I'm trying to get ripped.
I drink, like, six shakes a day, but nothing's happening.
- Do you also exercise?
- What?
You're supposed to exercise?
You know what, keep the powder.
I'll drink normal milkshakes.
And you thought that was my book.
Shame on you, Amy.
Shame on you.
You got the book?
You should know, things are good with Sharon.
I just want to make sure we're as happy in our relationship - as we can be.
- That's nice, Sarge.
Sorry you had to embarrass yourself.
Not a big deal.
I guess I just don't care what other people think of me.
That's actually pretty inspiring.
I wish I was more like that.
Yeah.
Now, if you'll excuse me Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey!
You're not gonna wait for me to leave?
Like I said, I just don't care.
Well, Garrett, our time is up.
Shall we pick up here next week?
No, I can't go.
There's still someone left inside that wants to talk.
Do you mean Satchel, the "gentle African-American man who was born in 1908"?
Oh, no, you know what?
Satchel probably shouldn't come out right now.
Or ever, for that matter.
Garrett, I can only help you if you open up.
And then Dufresne escaped through the tunnels of Shawshank Prison.
He was my friend.
Are you just doing Morgan Freeman?
Ah, yes!
You calling me on it just gave me a major breakthrough.
I'm cured!
Anyway, deuces, Doc!
I've got you now, you son of a bitch.
- Hello, Peralta.
-  You really thought you could sneak around my office without me noticing, huh?
How'd you know I was in there?
Your shampoo left an odor.
I could smell you.
I knew it!
You're a Hannibal.
Pull over right here.
Cut the engine.
Why are you doing this?
Because you found my notebooks, and I assume you've deduced what I did to Susan and James.
- You killed James too?
- Oops.
I guess you only deduced the Susan part.
But it doesn't matter.
You never would have thought that James was a suspect.
He was such a kind and gentle man.
So why did you kill them?
Well, because they were gonna tell people about my affair with Susan and ruin my career.
- I knew it.
- I had to do it for the sake of my other patients.
You know, there are a lot of people who depend on me for their well-being.
Yeah, except for the ones that you murder.
- That's only happened twice.
- It's happened before?
The Rothmans.
Nobody misses them.
You really are a terrible therapist.
Oh, wow, strong words for someone who is clearly scared to talk about his own issues.
I'm not scared, okay?
For example, I had an issue with texting while driving, but I fixed it.
Now I just don't look at my phone while I type.
Case in point.
Just know that you died without saying anything real.
Okay, okay, okay!
Stop.
Fine, you want something real?
I tried therapy.
It only made things worse.
Uh-huh.
Go on.
When I was a kid, I was acting out at school, so they made me and my parents do family counseling, but instead of helping me with my problems, the stupid therapist just brought up all my parents' issues.
And once it was all out in the open, they fought all the time and eventually got divorced, and everything good in my life just went away.
Interesting.
So you actually blame yourself for your parents' divorce?
No, I blame the therapy, which we only had to do because I oh, my God.
I do blame myself.
Oh, here come the waterworks.
Excuse me, do you have a less crinkly dollar - I could trade you for?
- Of course I do.
None of my dollars has a single crinkle.
When they do, I steam them.
Oh.
Wow, that is crisp.
Can't wait to get this baby home and flatten it out.
- Almonds, nice choice.
- Oh, thanks.
They're, uh they're not for me.
They're for my girlfriend, Detective Diaz.
Oh, you must be Jocelyn.
What?
No, I'm Denise.
Who's Jocelyn?
Is Rosa cheating on me?
Oh, my No, that was a joke.
I'm sorry, I thought it would be funny.
I am Jocelyn.
Oh, that was actually very funny.
I didn't know what was happening, and then I thought I knew what was happening, but what I thought I knew was happening wasn't what was happening.
That's very good.
- You must be Captain Holt.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Uh, can you give us a second, babe?
Yeah, I'll wait out there.
Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
So this is Jocelyn?
I'm glad you got to meet her.
For the record, I wasn't keeping her from you because I was afraid you were gonna hurt her feelings by being judgy.
I think it's hilarious when you're judgy.
It's because I was afraid you weren't gonna like her.
You and I are close, and I I value your opinion.
Well, she seems great, in our limited interaction.
Maybe you could get to know her better over Kevin's rice this weekend?
That would be great.
You might want to save your girlfriend.
She's talking to Hitchcock.
Damn it, Hitchcock!
So I joke about my father so much to avoid processing all the pain he's caused me.
Yes.
You are doing such great work here.
- I'm really feeling it.
- Yeah.
Now, I'm sorry, but our session is coming to a close.
I guess I'll have to bill your widow.
Wow, that is cold-blooded, but I got to hand it to you, it's a pretty dope kill line.
Unfortunately, no one will be billed, though.
Isn't that right, Charles?
- Hi, Dr. Tate!
- What?
How did he Told you I could text without looking at my phone.
Let's go.
Oh, man, I am so glad you got my message with the location.
Pretty impressive, right?
Well, actually, you just texted a bunch of crazy, weird, random letters.
It made me concerned, so I tracked your phone.
Well, still pretty good.
I found you in my contacts.
It went to Amy.
She forwarded it to me.
It worked.
Let's stop talking about it.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I guess you were right about the therapist.
Yeah, well, that's nice of you to say, Charles, but actually, when I was stalling Dr. Tate, I started talking about my parents' divorce, and it felt really good.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think I'm gonna make an appointment with a shrink.
Jake, that is so great.
And I know a guy who's really good.
You will love having him inside of you.
Okay.
What?
Oh, come on, mister.
Grow up.
Get your mind out of the gutter, ya perv!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
1 Hey, what's up?
I came as fast as I could.
Title of your sex tape.
Nailed it.
So have you ever heard of a guy named Bruno Rojas?
Yeah, big guy in the Colombian cartel, right?
He was, until he got shot in the chest yesterday by his top lieutenant.
Apparently, the bullet went straight through his nipple.
Whoa.
Nature's bull's-eye.
Oh, my God, I love the way your brain works.
Anyway, he's in a coma now, and Captain Holt thinks if I'm here when he wakes up, I can get him to talk.
- So what'd you call me for?
- Because I need a partner.
- What about them?
- Oh, we're not here for work.
I brought Scully in because he needs some medical tests.
Yeah, I'm here all the time.
I'm kind of the mayor of this place.
Cheryl, baby, you got a fresh bag for me?
Saving you the biggest one, Scully.
You're too good to me.
Anyway, I'll see you guys around.
Dan, Dan, the enema man.
Well, guess it's kind of nice to see Scully in his element.
Whoo!
Jake, I can't stay here with you.
I have so much on my plate at work.
Yeah, so do I. I mean, I've been pulling double shifts nonstop, but we haven't really gotten to hang out in almost a month.
Our anniversary is coming up, and we don't even have anything planned.
I know, but we talked about this.
We're gonna take a trip as soon as we have time.
- I promise.
- Just like you promised we would see the "Bumblebee" movie?
I didn't promise that.
I believe what I said was, "Isn't that a kids' movie"?
Yeah, and I believe what I said was, "It's for teens".
Look, I get that you can't take any time off from work, but this is a loophole.
It's still work.
You know, we can hang out here and chat and catch up and laugh, and technically, we'll be doing our jobs.
I call it a "casecation".
Casecation, all I ever wanted Ooh.
Casecation, had to get away Babe, this is so sweet, but do you honestly think that Holt's gonna let me just hang out here with you indefinitely?
Yes.
Just tell him I need supervision.
I've spent the last six years building up a reputation as an irresponsible goof for this very moment.
That is ridiculous.
Holt respects you.
Does he, though?
Hello, you've reached the office of Raymond Holt.
I can come to the phone right now.
Hey, sir, I'm just here at the hospital with Jake, and I think he could use some Oversight?
Agreed.
- So?
- Casecation All I ever wanted  Prepare to be romanced.
- VoilÃ .
-  Bienvenue Ã  Paris.
-  - Bonjour, madame.
Fromage?
Don't worry, Charles is leaving - in a second.
- I am?
Yeah, you were just helping me set up.
Fine.
Enjoy your weird anniversary with just the couple, you selfish jerks.
Thank you for your help!
- So what do you think?
- I love it.
- It's really romantic.
- Aww.
I mean, except for the comatose body in the middle of the room.
Oh, yeah, just pretend he's part of Paris.
Imagine we're on a walking tour of the Louvre, and he's a statue.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
Shall we, ma chÃ©rie?
I asked the lady at the store what her favorite cheeses were, and those were all super expensive, so I got us a budget-conscious selection of local cheddars.
So, a full year of marriage.
What was your favorite part?
Are you asking me to do a marriage highlight reel countdown Ã  la "NBA Inside Stuff"?
I mean, that's not exactly what I was Number five!
Ahmad Rashad.
It's my best impression.
Number five was the time that we accidentally got our contact lenses switched.
I got to see the world through your eyes.
But our prescriptions are different, - and the world was so blurry.
- Yeah, it was crazy.
I thought I was having a stroke.
- Okay, your turn.
- Number four!
Oh, is an old witch introducing this highlight?
That was exactly what you sounded like.
- No.
- Yes.
- Agree to disagree.
- Fine.
Number four was when we played laser tag and we shot all those little kids.
Oh, yeah.
We really messed up little Mason's birthday party.
- Mm-hmm.
- Deservedly so.
- He was a jerk.
- Ugh.
Okay, what should number three be?
Ooh, I know.
It was that time we shared an UberPool with Michael Caine.
Oh!
I mean, obviously, Michael Caine was shooting a movie in London at that time, and also, why would Michael Caine be in an UberPool?
- But it was still so cool.
- It really was.
- We shared a car with Alfred.
- We did!
Okay, number two.
This might be my favorite moment of our entire time as a couple: January 6th.
- Eddie Redmayne's birthday.
- Why do you know that?
'Cause he was weird in "Jupiter Ascending".
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just a fan.
Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about.
Okay.
It was the coldest night of the year, and you put socks on my feet while I slept.
You never even took credit for it.
But now I'm getting credit for that and for not taking credit.
That's double credit, you fool.
-  - You two are just the cutest.
I can't wait for number one!
Oh, it's Ahmad Rashad.
I'm Pam.
I'm from next door.
I was listening to the two of you talk and just had to get a look.
You're both very attractive.
- Aren't they?
- Boyle, go home!
Oh, Pam can stay but not me?
Yeah, because she's a patient here.
I'm assuming, because of your gown.
I am.
I have a twisted bowel.
I have a tube; I have a bag.
Do you want to see?
Oh, no, no, no.
But thank you, Pam.
Let me know if you smell anything.
I don't even notice it anymore.
Well, I'm pretty sure I actually already smell something.
- No, you'll know.
- Oh.
Do you two have kids?
Mixed race babies are always so adorable.
Oh, you said words.
Yeah, we don't have kids yet, but we're gonna start trying soon.
I just have the one, my Bobby.
He was such a cute little kid, until he discovered his wiener.
Pam, there you are.
It's time for your IV.
You're playing music in here?
You can't do that.
Why not, Nurse Janet?
Is it gonna distract the doctors?
Yes, that's exactly what it'll do.
Okay, fine, I'll turn it off immediately.
- Are we the bad guys here?
- Yeah, it seems very likely.
Hey, by the way, we don't have to pretend we're undercover here.
The hospital staff knows we're cops.
Oh, I wasn't setting up cover.
- Was I?
- Well, just the kids thing.
Saying that we were gonna start trying soon.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean right away.
I just meant in the near future.
Oh.
Okay.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool, except for that there's one little problem there, which is that I don't know that I totally know that I for sure want to have kids, so - You don't?
- No.
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.
Oh.
I don't understand.
I thought we were on the same page about kids.
- We talked about this.
- We did?
Aw, look at these pictures my brother sent of Matthew.
- Mm.
- We should do this someday.
What do you think?
Are you kidding me?
Of course.
I was talking about going to the water park.
You were talking about having kids?
Yeah!
I said, "Do you think we can afford it"?
And you said, "We'll start saving right away".
So let me get this straight.
All that water park money I've been saving, you want to spend it on kids now?
Yeah.
Why would you want to spend that much money on a water park?
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say here.
I just I never wanted children.
Well, I always have.
All right, so how do we handle this?
I mean, there's only one thing to do when two people have diametrically opposing views on a subject.
Talk about it lovingly and decide how to move forward?
- Structured debate.
- Oh.
Fun.
High school format.
Modified Lincoln-Douglas.
Let's take one hour apart for research and prep.
Yeah.
Great, I'll just do a Lincoln-Douglas.
I'd be careful if I were you.
Relationships are like bowels.
Once you get them twisted, they can never untwist.
Pam, you're in here again.
That's all you prepped?
Yeah, I just searched my heart and then wrote down how I was feeling.
I'm gonna eat you alive, you dumb son of a bitch.
Cool.
And then we'll have kids together?
Yeah.
It's gonna be great.
Okay, the topic today is whether or not we should have children.
I will be taking the affirmative.
You will be taking the negative.
Each round will be individually scored by our judge, Captain Holt.
Do you need to hear my credentials?
Debate moderator license D as in delta, 8-1-0 - I believe you.
- Y as in Yankee, 4-1.
J as in Juliet, J as in Juliet, 6.
- Great.
- I have a variety of timers.
- Do you prefer a buzz or a ding?
- Don't care.
- Ding.
- Okay.
Peralta, you can present the first argument from your, uh  Scribbled list of feelings.
I'll have you know that I have some data-driven arguments as well.
According to a study I read, people with kids were less likely to report that they were happy in their lives than people without kids.
Now, call me crazy, but being happy tends to make me feel, uh, pretty happy.
Where did you read this study?
Well, it wasn't something I read so much as told about.
And who told you about it?
- Hitchcock.
- Hitchcock?
- Yeah.
- That seems like a pretty intellectual thing for him to mention.
What was the context?
He had invested in a NuvaRing competitor called Vag-a-Plug and was practicing his sales pitch on me.
This is your first argument?
Your opening statement?
-  - Point to Amy.
All right, fine.
Forget the study.
I just don't want to lose what we already have.
Ask anyone with children and they'll tell you children bring meaning and love into your life.
Yes, there may be some moments that you lose, but there will also be new moments.
Take the water park.
I would never go with you, but you know who would?
- Your kid.
- Point to Amy.
That's not your call to make, Peralta.
Point to Amy.
Okay, fine.
New subject: work.
We both work way too much.
Why bother having kids if you never get to spend time with them?
I mean, I love my job, and I know you love yours, and I don't think it's fair for either of us to have to sacrifice that.
Do you know why I want to become lieutenant so badly?
To prove your worth to your hyper judgmental parents.
Yes, obviously that.
But also, the higher your rank, the more control over your hours.
Plenty of people have jobs and kids, Jake, and they find a way.
This has become more about your employment status.
As your supervisor, I feel I have a conflict of interest and should abstain from judging.
Okay, so do we both get a point?
No.
Kevin has been on the phone all this time.
He's also a licensed debate moderator.
License number J as in Juliet, 2-5-9 - This means nothing to me.
- H as in hotel.
- Z as in Zulu.
- Oh, thank God he stopped.
3-6-9.
- Point to Amy.
- Okay, fine.
You want to know why I really don't want to have children?
I had a crappy dad.
I know what happens when you mess up as a parent.
It's not great.
And this may come as a shock to you, but I kind of have some dad issues with certain people.
- Holt.
- Me.
- Raymond.
- Yeah, but not just him.
It's every male authority figure from my entire life.
Hey, Jake, can you move "Legends of the Fall" from new releases into drama?
You got it, Dad.
Craig was only six weeks older than me.
Since this has become about me, I'm gonna have to abstain from this round as well, but Kevin is still standing by.
Actually, I feel as though your personal relationship with Peralta affects me too.
Luckily, I had Gail standing by as well.
Oh, my God, you guys know Gail?
Who's Gail?
Vice president of the Debaters Club.
This is a very big deal.
Do you need to hear my credentials?
License number U as in uniform, 7 No!
No more credentials, please.
I don't want to have a structured debate.
It's an idiotic way to decide something.
- What?
- How dare you?
Is he insane?
Raymond, Kevin, I'll be reporting this.
Okay, look.
Amy, I'm scared, okay?
I'm scared that we're gonna have a child and I won't be able to handle it, I'm scared that I'm not gonna be a good father, and I'm scared that I'll make a mistake I can't take back.
Jake, I get it.
I'm scared too.
Every other big decision I've made in my life I was sure about: becoming a cop, asking you to marry me, buying those Jordan 1s for $500.
Wait, you spent $500 on sneakers?
Yeah, they were so cool, and if I had never worn them, they would have kept their value.
- So they lost their value?
- Yes, all of it.
I stepped in a puddle as soon as I left the store.
But this isn't about the Jordans.
This is about the fact that I don't want to bring a human being into this world unless I'm 100% sure that I'm ready to take care of it.
Okay?
Too emotional.
Point to Amy.
Okay, Gail is clearly biased.
I think we need a new moderator.
Bob Templeman here.
What?
How many people are on this phone call?
Hey, so Holt went to go smooth things over with Gail.
He thinks we may just have to pay the Debaters Guild a small fine.
Cool.
And as you can see, Pam is here.
She has some thoughts.
I was saying to Jake, before Bobby, I didn't think I wanted to have kids either.
But he's the best thing that ever happened to me.
Hey, Pam, could you give us a minute?
Oh, of course.
I'm gonna call my friend JoAnn.
She's been waiting for a big update on all of this.
Great.
I'm sorry.
The debate was a bad idea.
I just I felt ambushed by the fact that you didn't want kids, and I thought I could fix it with logic.
I mean, what if I had won the debate?
Jake, I'm trying so hard to be nice, but I don't know how to respond to that.
- Cold-blooded but fair.
- I get it.
You're scared.
I can't change that.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'll never change how I feel about it.
I mean, I used to be scared of sushi, and now it's my favorite food.
I got tuna sashimi from a pharmacy the other day.
- You shouldn't have.
- Yeah, it was very warm.
I got so sick.
Look, can we just press pause on this conversation?
I mean, let's enjoy our lives for a little bit, and then maybe the next time it comes up, I'll feel differently, okay?
- No.
- What?
I need an answer from you now.
Like right this minute?
You can take a day or a week, or maybe a month.
That's not a lot of time, Ames.
I mean, that doesn't seem totally fair.
Well, now you know how I feel.
Women don't have the luxury of waiting till we're 60 and then changing our minds and getting remarried and having a baby with some dumb 28-year-old.
Oh, come on.
There's no way I'm gonna be rich enough that a 28-year-old is gonna want to be with me.
Did that help?
Look, I don't understand what the big deal is.
You're still young.
We have plenty of time.
I know, but I don't want to wait around for two years and then have you decide you don't want kids, 'cause I don't want to start over at 38.
Start over?
Like, with someone else?
Casecation, all I ever wanted Casecation, had to get away Casecation The vibe in here is really weird I think they're having a fight.
No, it's not a fight, it's just a devastatingly sad conversation about whether or not we should have kids or just start over, so you were totally wrong, Rosa.
What?
You got married without talking about if you want children?
Yeah, and we also got married without discussing whether or not we like water parks.
A lot of new stuff has come up, okay, Terry?
- Why are you guys here?
- A CI came in.
There's a lot of chatter that whoever tried to kill Rojas is coming to finish the job.
- At the hospital?
- Yeah.
Holt wanted extra manpower here.
Okay, why don't you two lock down the nurses' station while Amy and I secure the room?
Actually, I'd rather be with Rosa.
- Uh-oh.
- Damn, Jake.
Thanks a lot, Sarge.
You told me to sing!
Yeah, but what was all this?
That's just Terry being Terry.
Okay, from this vantage we can see the elevator and the stairs.
No one should be able to get to Rojas without us noticing.
- Cool.
- Hey, look, um I don't want you to get caught in the middle of this stuff between me and Jake.
I don't want you to choose sides.
- Already chose.
I'm with you.
- Really?
I didn't know you wanted kids.
I don't know if I'll ever want kids, but you should have them.
They're so cute.
- It's  up.
- Aw, it is  up.
Anyway, do you want me to talk to Jake?
- I'm a pretty good bully.
- Thanks, but no.
I've got this covered.
I left him alone with Terry.
That guy is a walking advertisement for the joys of fatherhood.
- Do not do it.
- What?
- Don't you love your girls?
- So much.
You should have seen Cagney this morning - with her little braids in.
- Oh.
But they are a ton of work, man.
If you are not totally, 100% sure you want them, you won't survive.
- Is it really that hard?
- Yes.
I never get any sleep.
I'm always sick.
I never get to watch anything I want on TV.
I still haven't finished "Breaking Bad," but I can recite "Moana" from memory?
"Maui, shape-shifter, demigod of the wind and sea.
I am Moana".
Why do I know that?
I don't want to watch kids' movies.
I want to watch movies for adults.
Adults and teens.
And they are getting so manipulative.
Yesterday, Cagney pretended to be hurt, I went in to help her, and Lacey snuck in the kitchen and stole two cookies.
Oh, my God.
Your children are monsters.
Hey, those are my kids, man.
- Back off.
- Right.
And the crazy part is, I really do want to go to the water park, but I can't give that to him because it's the only card I hold.
- Mm.
-  Elevator.
Excuse me, NYPD.
Can I see your ID?
Amy, behind the wheelchair.
NYPD!
Stop!
- Diaz for Jeffords.
- This is Terry.
I think we got our guy.
Colombian man, unarmed, but he tried to run as soon as we identified ourselves.
And he's got a picture of Rojas on his phone.
We'll be right there.
No one in or out of this hallway.
Why do you think that guy is unarmed?
Who knows?
Maybe he was trying to smother Rojas or unplug his life support.
Or maybe he's a distraction, and someone else is going for the cookie jar.
What?
Hi, Pam.
Hi, Jake.
Don't come any closer, or I'll blow us both up!
I'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to be here.
- This wasn't part of the plan.
- It's okay, Pam.
No need to panic.
We're just talking.
Look, I'm just gonna put this away.
No, Terry, don't open that, please.
What's going on in there?
There is a woman in here with an explosive device.
- What?
You okay?
- Yep.
Everyone is fine.
I just need you to evacuate this entire floor, call ESU and the bomb squad right away, and jam all cellular and Wi-Fi signals.
On it.
Okay, Pam, so we're just gonna stay calm here and talk this thing through as friends.
This isn't supposed to be happening.
The man said that I'd be able to sneak in here unnoticed.
What man?
Who asked you to do this?
I didn't get his name, but he was very attractive.
Antonio Banderas could play him in a movie.
What has he been doing lately?
You know what?
He should be on "Outlander".
Okay, Pam, I'm gonna cut you off, but it's not because I'm not interested.
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
I get chatty when I get nervous.
This man who gave you the bomb, did he happen to mention whether or not it's on a timer or if there's a remote detonator?
I don't know.
I'm terrible with electronics.
I wish my son Bobby were here.
He taught me how to iPad.
Okay, I also know how to iPad, so maybe I could take a look.
Stay where you are!
The man told me that when I got the bomb set, I should text him with this phone and if anything went wrong, I should push this button.
No, no, no, no!
You don't want to do that.
Yes, I do.
I have to.
Well, there's only one thing to do when two people have diametrically opposing opinions on a subject.
- Structured debate.
- What?
Yeah, I just learned about it.
All right, I will argue the negative: I don't want to blow up.
And you can argue the affirmative: you do want to blow up, which I have to say, Pam, is a very tough stance to take.
I don't want to blow up, but the man said he'd give me $500,000.
This is so Bobby can take care of my granddaughter.
That girl means the world to me.
Fine, fine.
Point to Pam.
But if you care about her so much, how can you just blow yourself up?
You'll never get to see her again.
Well, at least I know she'll be financially well taken care of.
Sure, but is this really how you want her to remember you?
- As a murderer?
- I'd rather be remembered as a woman who blew up a mobster to help her family rather than a librarian whose bowels are tied up like a sailor's knot!
Okay, that's a very strong argument.
Very strong.
But you're forgetting one thing.
You're not just gonna be killing a mobster.
You're also gonna be killing me.
He said the blast would only hurt people in the room.
You could just walk right out of here.
Pam, you know I can't do that.
Now, please, just give me the bomb.
And then what?
Bobby doesn't get any money and I go to jail?
I can't go to jail.
Every roommate I've ever had has hated me.
In college, I had a roommate named Mary-Ellen, and she was dating the brother of Steve Guttenberg Pam, what are we talking about here?
I'm sorry.
I'm really nervous.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
I know it probably feels like you don't have a lot of options right now.
In fact, this whole situation probably feels like like a twisted bowel, but it's not.
There's still one end of this bowel that's open.
Which end?
- The butt end.
- I'm listening.
Okay, if you hand me that bomb right now, nothing bad will have happened, and that'll be because of you, because you cooperated.
Also, I'm sure a judge would understand how you got into this situation.
I mean, you were asked to do this by an Antonio Banderas type.
Who could say no to that?
And even if you do go to prison, it is gonna be such a fancy prison.
- With a lot of crafts?
- Yes, with tons of crafts.
Pam, listen to me.
Let's untwist this bowel together.
Let's clear everything out.
Okay.
You did great, Pam.
Thank you.
Now that it's out of my hands, I can see it really is a bomb.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
- Oh, my God, get some help!
- Okay.
- You okay?
- Hey.
Yeah, I'm okay.
Really surprised by Pam.
- I did not see that coming.
- Right?
You should have seen the look on my face when I saw it was her.
Your jaw just dropped.
- Oh, she's right there.
- Mm-hmm.
Good-bye, Pam.
Good luck with everything.
- Kind of liked her in the end.
- Yeah.
So did they defuse the bomb?
Yeah, one of 'em.
Oh, you didn't hear?
There was a second bomb.
Ya butt.
- Ya butt is da bomb.
- Aww.
On our anniversary.
Speaking of which, I requested next week off so we can take an actual vacation to the water park.
I've never been more in love with you in my entire life.
And hey, I've been thinking, and I do want to have kids.
With you.
- You're not scared anymore?
- Oh, no, I am so scared.
Maybe even more so than before, but I was scared in there with Pam too, and you know, I didn't panic or mess anything up there.
If anything, I was sharper.
I was a freakin' debate genius.
Debate genius?
Oh, that's very hot.
Oh, that's an added bonus.
Okay, keep that energy up.
But the point that I was actually trying to make is, maybe it's a good thing that I'm scared of fatherhood.
You know?
Maybe it'll turn me into a freakin' dad genius.
But we don't have to start trying right away, right?
I mean, I don't know that I'm all the way there yet.
No, of course not.
- Whenever we're both ready.
- How do you know when that is?
I guess we'll just have to have another one of these really fun, casual conversations.
Cool.
Love that.
Can't wait.
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, please.
Maybe we can grab some Thai food and brainstorm baby names?
Ooh, I like that.
Now, I am a fan of the show "American Gladiators".
How do you feel about the name Blaze Peralta?
Not great.
- What about Laser?
- No.
- Nitro?
- No.
- Viper?
- No.
- Atlas?
- Ooh, I do love atlases.
Mm, common ground.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
1 I'm here!
I'm here, I'm here.
You can start the meeting now.
The meeting is over.
You're late.
You missed roll call and the tutorial on using the new copiers.
Six years, and no matter how hard I try, I still can't get you to understand the importance of being punctual.
Maybe you should just give up and accept me for who I am?
No, I will break you.
- Right now.
- Oh.
While you were out being tardy, I was hard at work devising a special punishment.
I've crafted an intricate personal high five with everyone in this office except you.
What?
But you hate high fives.
Yes, every minute of it was hell.
But it'll be worse for you.
Squad, dismissed.
Good-bye, Diaz.
Salute into a fanny waggle?
- Good-bye, Boyle.
- Oh, the snake charmer!
Good-bye, Jeffords.
- That's a butt bump.
- Good-bye, Santiago.
Double fist bump reverse explosion into a Pete Townshend strum.
All right, that was terrible, but it's over now, and I made it through.
Good-bye, Leonard from Xerox.
What?
No, no, no.
The copy guy?
So nice of you to stop by, Kevin.
Enjoy your day.
I hope it's productive.
Thank you, Raymond.
I hope your day is productive as well.
PDA in the office?
My, my.
- Couldn't help myself.
- Hmm.
Oh, may I please use the precinct facilities before I head to work?
Yes.
Thank you for asking for permission.
Thank you for granting it.
- Whoomp.
- There it is!
Got to say, I could have used a little more oomph on the whoomp.
That's the oomphiest whoomp you'll get.
So what's going on?
Why'd you want to meet in private?
I need your help with a case.
Three antique coins were stolen from my classics department at Columbia.
So why not ask Captain Holt for help on the case?
Wait, are you guys getting a divorce?
I can handle it.
This doesn't bring up any weird issues for me.
No, it's nothing like that.
Raymond's a brilliant detective.
It's just when a case involves me, he can get a little overemotional.
- You remember the safe house.
- Oh, yeah, he went crazy.
But I also remember you and me becoming best friends and watching every Nic Cage movie ever made.
- Can you still quote them all?
- No, I purged myself of that nonsense.
- Oh, I bet it's still in there.
- It's not.
- We'll see.
- We won't.
- There's a chance it's in there.
- Chance of zero.
I'd put money that maybe it's there.
- You're losing your money.
- Okay.
- So will you help me?
- I don't know.
I want to, but keeping a secret from Holt?
- That's a lot of pressure.
- Hmm.
Am I remembering correctly?
Don't you eat pressure for breakfast?
Nic Cage in "The Rock".
We are best friends.
I am so in!
-  - Oh, no, that's Raymond.
That's how he opens a door.
Kevin, are you still in here?
Uh, yes, Raymond, I'm in the stall.
Some tickets were just released for Mahler's Fourth Symphony this weekend.
Great.
That sounds great.
Let's do it.
Fantastic.
Now, which section do you prefer?
The first tier, the second tier, the third tier The first tier.
Now, which section of the first tier?
Right, left, right center, center Just any section is fine.
Any section, wow.
Someone had pepper on their eggs this morning.
- I'll buy the tickets.
-   Any section.
Guys, horrible news.
The fridge broke this morning.
Everything's warm.
Doesn't seem like that big a deal.
- Your yogurt's spoiled.
- Who did this?
Okay, everyone calm down.
I will put a request in for a new fridge.
Good luck getting that approved.
Commissioner Kelly's already slashed our budget within an inch of its life.
Yeah, the toilet paper's only one ply now.
- My butt hurts all the time.
- The AC is broken.
My butt hurts all the time.
Scully's butt hurts all the time.
All right, guys, we get it.
It's just that lunch is the one part of the day Commissioner Kelly hadn't ruined.
People are pissed.
Morale's really taken a hit.
Okay, I got this.
Hey, squad.
Lunch is on me today.
Taking everyone out for pizza.
And that's how you improve morale.
Okay.
You're not the only sergeant around here.
Let me help.
This side of the room, lunch is on me, and we're getting something better than pizza.
Sushi!
Are you trying to outdo me?
No, no, no.
Just trying to raise morale.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Morale, morale, morale.
Okay.
Wow, so this is your classroom.
What's today's lecture about?
I know you don't care about that.
Just ask me what you want to ask me.
Can I play with your laser pointer?
You know, the laser pointer is a bit of a misnomer.
It is simply a laser.
The pointer is you.
- That was awesome.
- Take it for a spin.
Don't mind if I do.
Good afternoon, class.
Allow me to make my first point.
- Very impressive.
- Thank you very much, Kevin.
But I do have five additional points to make.
Chair, chair, wall, chair, Captain Holt.
Captain Holt?
No.
Yes, that was a delicious lunch, Gary!
And I agree, our group does seem happier than it was before.
Oh, the pizza was that good?
Pizza?
Right, that's what I said we were getting before we decided to uh-snazz it up.
Oh, you guys snazzed?
Yeah, we snazzed all the way to La Petite Creperie.
I thought we couldn't say "snazz".
Oh, no, I was thinking of .
We can't say .
Carry on.
Tell 'em how good it was, Rosa.
Tell 'em how high our morale is.
- High.
- Oh, stop gushing, girl.
I think it's so interesting you guys didn't stick to your original plan, because neither did we.
What?
Why?
Oh, you don't think we knew you were gonna snazz?
We saw your snazz coming a mile away.
That's why I took my team out for some big, juicy steaks, and  Mashed potatoes And some spinach and some key lime pie - Thank you, Heather.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, that doesn't sound better than crepes.
It is.
Terry wins.
We know.
We were at both lunches.
How?
They were simultaneous and two miles apart.
It was free food.
Life finds a way.
Okay, but you can't win because it wasn't a competition.
So let's make it a competition.
Same groups tomorrow?
Okay, but let's agree at the end of this - that we'll still be friends.
- No deal.
Good!
'Cause I didn't mean it anyway.
Hello, sir.
How'd you find us out?
Mahler's Fourth Symphony.
He'd never sit in just any section.
I might.
I'm flexible.
Oh, really?
You'd sit center left?
In timpani alley?
I'll purchase those tickets right away.
No, don't!
Fine.
Jake is helping me with a burglary here at the university, and I asked him not to tell you.
- Is this about St. Augustine?
- Yes.
- What's going on?
- He's embarrassed of me.
Last Christmas, the classics department threw a holiday party.
I had one drink too many and utterly humiliated myself.
And that was the point St. Augustine was making in "Consolation of Philosophy".
Yeah, sounds super humiliating, saying something smart.
Smart?
I confused St. Augustine with Boethius.
I might as well have stepped on a rake and bonked myself on the forehead.
The problem wasn't what you said.
It was that Dean Allister pointed out your mistake, and you lost your damned mind.
I misremembered it because I'm reading both simultaneously.
One book is too few for me.
Where is everyone going?
It was quite the kerfuffle.
The problem is, is that I get flustered and defensive because I know how they all see me: as Kevin's working-class bimbo.
I can't imagine that's what they think.
- It is.
- Really?
Obviously I know that they're wrong, but they put you in your own head, and you're not yourself around them.
I'm sorry, I was just trying to protect you.
Yes, of course, thank you for saving me from myself.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go sit by the pool and read some fiction like the bimbo that I am.
There's a pool here?
Sir, wait.
Oh!
Wasn't expecting to catch up to you so fast.
I don't know what to say now.
I thought I was gonna have more running time to formulate it.
Oh, I know!
I'm sorry that we kept the case a secret from you.
Oh, I understand why you did.
The truth is, ever since I met Kevin, I've felt insecure in his world.
I can't compete with these highly educated academics.
I worry every day that I'll make one St. Augustine slip too many, and he'll realize - I'm beneath him.
- This is insane.
You're the smartest person I know.
I'll explain it to you.
Among Kevin's peers, - I'm a Jake.
- No, no, no, no, no.
I refuse to live in a world where you're the Jake, because if you're the Jake, what does that make me?
- The Charles?
- The Hitchcock.
The Hitchcock?
Oh, my God.
You dropped down so many more levels than I was expecting.
Okay, you know what?
Screw this.
You are so smart, and we're gonna prove it to those professors.
You're gonna work this case, and you're gonna find those coins.
Well, I suppose it would be nice to show them I'm more than just a hot, dumb piece of ass.
Yes!
That's the spirit.
Now get that hot ass moving, 'cause we've got a crime to solve.
Peralta, please, have some decorum.
What?
I was just using your words.
Look, you teach people the way you want to be treated.
That's what Dr. Phil says.
Okay, lunchtime starts in ten minutes.
Whichever team wins gets recorded on the Whiteboard of Victory.
The winner will be decided by our judges, Hitchcock and Scully.
Oh, my God, are we high status, Hitchcock?
- I think so.
- What a world.
Ah, well, good luck.
I'm sure you know all the best places to eat since you've reached Elite status on Yelp.
Oh, wait, that was me.
Oh, because Yelp reviewers are sane people with great taste?
Oh, sorry, couldn't hear you over GourmetGlen12 saying that my review of the duck skin at the Hearth and Feather was helpful.
Come on, Team Jeffords.
It's chow time.
We have a cool thing to say too.
Team Santiago, let's lunch-a-bunch!
- No, I don't say that.
- Come on, Rosa, please?
Let's lunch-a-bunch.
Aha, Rosa said it!
Did you hear that?
Did you hear it?
- Ah, Dean Allister?
- Policeman Raymond.
Good to see you.
Read any interesting magazines lately?
This again?
I was waiting for Kevin, I had finished my book, and I happened to glance at an issue of "The Economist" that someone left lying about.
All I remember is you becoming unhinged.
The only reason I picked it up was to swat a fly.
I mean, I'm not crazy.
Why are there always flowers here?
So is policeman Raymond joining the case?
Actually, he's leading it.
Captain Holt is the finest investigator I've ever worked with.
Sir, tell him our plan of action.
- Clues.
- Okay, you're freezing up.
I'm just gonna take the wheel for now.
There were no signs of forced entry, the only people with access to the archives were the professors in the department, and they all have alibis, which means I don't know what you want me to say.
Okay, that's my fault for throwing it to you again.
Which means we need to examine the crime scene.
It is there that we will find what Captain Holt has so eloquently described as Clues?
Sir, you just said it.
Cupcakes up, everyone.
Heather, you already ate yours?
The point is to eat it in their faces.
- Honk, honk, bitches.
- What the hell?
We rented a party limo, drove to Coney Island for hot dogs, and then did karaoke the entire time.
I sang "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy.
Crushed it.
But that's not even about lunch!
- It's - An experience.
- Team Amy wins.
- What?
How did you get there?
You were just with us.
- Scully was with them.
- Free food.
Great cupcake, Sarge.
- But Amy still wins.
- Eat snazz, losers!
Okay, so there were no witnesses, no cameras, and no prints.
In other words, we have nothing.
That's what you get when you put a bimbo on the case.
Okay, well, let's not give up all hope just yet.
We do know some things.
For example, the perp entered using a key, which means they probably work here.
And they knew enough to skip past all these expensive-looking artifacts.
They walked straight up to this shelf and grabbed the coin case from up there.
It's too high.
You can't reach it.
Exactly.
So now we know that the thief was taller than me.
That's a good lead.
Also, we know they were a little bit of a freak, since I am above average height according to the 1940 census.
I didn't realize you had a thing about your height.
I don't!
Because I'm above average.
Why would I have a thing about my height when I'm above average?
It doesn't make any sense.
Anyways, we're looking for an insanely tall perp, a real Shaq type.
Maybe the thief stood on something, like one of these drawers.
Turn off the light.
Maybe something will show up under UV.
- Bingpot!
- A footprint.
You did it, you brilliant bimbo.
Oh, there you are.
Why are you in the dark?
Were you not able to find the light switch?
Ha-ha, very funny, but I'll actually have you know Captain Holt just found a very promising lead.
Oh, how fun, a lead.
Meanwhile, we actually found the thief.
- You did?
- What?
Well, technically our janitor found him.
Come on in, Randy.
Tell them how you did their jobs.
Well, um, I was emptying the trash in Professor Port's office.
I saw something shiny sticking out from underneath a notepad.
It was one of the missing coins.
Great police work.
Perhaps you might want to hire Randy, or Randy, you could hire them.
It seems like you all have basically the same skill set.
We're actually all staffed up in maintenance.
We don't want your job, Randy.
I know Dean Allister humiliated us, but we can still have our revenge.
I watched a ton of horny '80s comedies when I was a kid, and they're filled with ways of getting back at mean deans.
So we are gonna throw the wildest party - this campus has ever seen.
- No.
Okay, then we'll have a bikini car wash.
No, no, save your schemes.
I know exactly how to get back at the dean.
- By arresting him.
- For what?
It seems pretty obvious that Port did it.
No, no, that makes no sense.
Why would someone steal something valuable and then leave it in their desk?
I feel like this is a veiled shot at me for leaving the crown in my desk during the third Halloween Heist.
- It is.
- Oh.
Allister planted the coin in Professor Port's desk.
- They're rivals.
- Mm.
Did you see the book Allister was holding back there?
A biography of Macedonian general Parmenion.
He was taunting us.
Again, I'm the Hitchcock here.
You're gonna have to connect the dots for me.
Parmenion was a close advisor to Alexander the Great.
Alexander suspected that Parmenion was trying to supplant him, so he executed him.
He was getting rid of his rival.
Sir, you cracked it!
You and your big hard brain.
- Hard?
- Yes!
You have the biggest, hardest brain on Earth, and I want you to say it.
Say "I am Raymond Holt, and my brain is rock hard".
A brain shouldn't be hard.
If anything, I'll say, "I am Raymond Holt, and my brain is soft and wet".
No, don't say that.
It's gross and I hate it.
All right, let's go do some cop stuff.
Wait, why does Terry's team have four wins?
He only won steaks, bowling, and the mobile escape room.
You're forgetting about our breakfast at the Empire State Building.
It was so cold up there.
It sounds a lot better than our indoor skydiving lunch.
Speaking of which, are we gonna get reimbursed for that?
How dare you complain about the Funtastic FlyZone.
That was funtastic fun for everyone.
So what are you guys planning for today?
Oh, nothing much.
We're just gonna keep it "caszh".
Us too.
Super "caszh".
Super duper "caszh".
We all know you're both planning something insanely complicated and annoying.
Your teammates are turning against you, Terry.
- I'm on your team.
- Who cares?
We're gonna win.
Team Lunch-a-Bunch forever.
Sir, why are we still doing this?
We've been following him for days, and he hasn't done anything suspicious.
Let's just confront him.
He only hid one of the stolen coins in Port's desk.
He'll probably try to sell the others.
I want to catch him in the act.
-  - Shh.
Here he comes.
These college kids.
I used to wear long-sleeve T-shirts under my short-sleeve T-shirts.
Wait a minute, I still could.
Hang on.
He's stopping.
Oh, no, he forgot his phone.
He's gonna turn around and see us.
Come on.
- Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, hey, guys, what's up?
You want to join our a cappella jam circle?
Oh, no.
Are you guys Harry Potter fans?
I do not like where this is going.
Three, four.
Won't you come visit Hogwarts?
I'll be alone, dancing in Gryffindor Harry is the best at the spells And as for potions, Hermione does well This is actually pretty funny.
You got to know Harry Potter.
Wait a minute.
Where'd Allister go?
He was standing right here.
It's like he vanished without a trace.
Wrong, Peralta.
He vanished with a trace.
Check it out.
His footprint.
Gotcha.
I am Raymond Holt and my brain is rock hard.
- I'm not going to say that.
- Smart.
Saving it for a bigger moment in front of a bunch of people.
Can't wait!
Okay, squad, hope you ate lunch already, because it's lunchtime!
- What's with the getups?
- Oh, nothing much.
We just turned the parking garage into an elaborate paintball arena.
It's zombie-themed.
We hired 60 actors.
That sounds pretty expensive.
Nah, New York actors are desperate.
For ten bucks, you can shoot 'em right in the face.
Wow, that's amazing.
I don't know how anybody could ever beat that except maybe an in-office teppanyaki grill.
Moshi moshi, losers!
We got shrimp.
We got lobster.
Heather, I know you're allergic to shellfish.
You're just gonna have to not eat.
Where's Heather?
Where is everybody?
They're on the roof by Gina's statue.
- What the hell, guys?
- Oh, God, they found us.
- Don't let them take me.
- Why are you hiding from us?
This lunch competition has gotten out of hand.
No one is having fun.
I keep having panic dreams about Sergeant Santiago shooting down my lunch ideas.
Historic walking tours don't win lunch, Gary.
No one cares about winning lunch.
Please, just leave us alone.
Gary, wait.
Look - Oh!
- Ow!
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God, it was an accident.
This thing doesn't have a safety.
Ow!
Ow, stop!
Help!
And a big round of applause for Janitor Randy for recovering our precious coin.
Don't applaud for that man.
What's going on?
What's going on is, Captain Holt just solved this case.
What's there left to solve?
We found the coin in Professor Port's desk.
He's the thief.
Oh, you'd like everyone to believe that, wouldn't you, Dean Allister?
Or should I say, General Parmenion?
Raymond, are you causing a kerfuffle?
Yes.
Sometimes a moment calls for a kerfuffle.
No.
No moment calls for a kerfuffle.
You know my feelings on this.
Dean Allister framed Professor Port to get rid of a rival, just as Alexander got rid of Parmenion.
Preposterous.
Do you even have a shred of evidence to back up that claim?
Oh, we've got more than a shred.
Look at these photos.
Here, a footprint from the scene of the crime left by the thief.
And here, another print made yesterday by you.
- You've been caught, Allister!
- Is it happening?
- Caught by me.
- It is happening.
- Me and my rock hard brain.
- It happened!
Oh, Raymond.
Look around.
These shoes I'm wearing with their "unique footprint" we all have them.
They were the departmental gift this Christmas.
They're actually very funny.
They have Achilles printed on the heel.
I don't know if I would call that "very" funny.
I'm surprised you didn't know about them.
Kevin must have gotten a pair.
Oh, I remember what happened.
You had to leave the Christmas party before they were handed out.
Why was that again?
Oh, yes.
The kerfuffle.
But what about the autobiography of Persimminons you were taunting us with?
I suppose I can see how holding any book would seem like a taunt to you.
- I own a book.
- But I don't think Raymond is remembering the story correctly.
Alexander didn't see Parmenion as a rival.
He killed him over a dispute about his son.
Oh, no, it's Boethius all over again.
At least you got one thing right.
You do have a rock hard brain.
Because that's bad.
Everyone knows that a brain should be soft and wet.
I wanted to say that, but Jake told me not to.
Yeah, because it's gross.
There you are.
- You okay, sir?
- I'm fine.
I have decided to stop fighting it and lean in to the fact that I'm an idiot.
Look at me, playing a video game.
- Oh, which one?
- "Times" crossword app.
Not a video game.
It plays a little song when you solve it, as if you've just learned to potty.
Yes, yes, play me my dunce's tune.
Okay, so those guys look down on you.
So what?
I mean, Amy's parents look down on me.
They talk about me right in front of my face in Spanish because they don't think I'm smart enough to learn another language, but I've been taking classes, and now I can understand all the hurtful things they've been saying.
And how did that help?
Well, now I know they think I'm short and I was able to do some research and find that 1940s census that proves I'm above average in height.
- For 1940.
- Yeah, I'm taller than the greatest generation.
It doesn't matter.
The point is, you can use this.
There are benefits to being underestimated.
My goodness.
You're right.
There are benefits to being underestimated.
You can get away with anything.
Sir?
Are you going to kill the dean?
No.
What if the thief was someone we dismissed because they didn't have a classics background?
Someone who wasn't a professor?
But what about the footprints?
The shoes were only given to faculty.
There was one pair that was unaccounted for: Kevin's.
They were left at the party to be cleaned up.
By Janitor Randy!
My story solved it.
I'm tall.
Hey, everyone, we would like to say we're sorry for letting this competition get the best of us, and to make it up to you, we figured out what to do for lunch.
Please, whatever your new idea is, I just don't want to get shot again.
Ugh, Gary, it was a paintball.
Suck it up.
Isn't this supposed to be an apology?
Yes.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I shot my husband with a real bullet two years ago, - and it comes up way less than this.
- Way less than this.
- Guys!
- Right.
What we're trying to say is that we lost sight of what this was all really about: building morale.
So we bought two-ply toilet paper for the whole squad.
- I call shotgun!
- Shotgun!
Also, I sold the teppanyaki grill and used the money to turn the briefing room into the lunch zone.
Oh, no.
What's the lunch zone?
Is it someplace we have to put on a harness and not eat lunch?
There are no harnesses.
There are phone chargers and noise-canceling headphones.
So you can eat your lunch and stare at your phone and you won't have to see or hear anyone you work with.
- It's perfect.
- It's it's absolutely perfect.
We're so glad you like it.
And just to be sure, I'm not gonna get shot.
Oh, my God, Gary.
Yes!
You won't get shot!
Yeah, I stole those coins.
Can't believe you bought that whole story.
They underestimated you, Randy, just as they underestimated Raymond Holt.
Well, you guys haven't been that great to me either.
Well, you got to teach people how you want to be treated, Randy.
Dr. Phil, RIP.
The point is, Captain Holt solved the case when no one else could.
He's actually been stealing from these archives for years.
You've been asleep at the wheel, Allister.
- You're an embarrassment.
- Really?
Well, at least I've never confused St. Augustine with Boethius.
Oh, who gives a rat's ass about Boethius, Wesley?
What are you doing, Kevin?
- I am creating a kerfuffle.
- Oh, damn.
Sure, my husband is a hot piece of ass, but he is so much more than just that.
Raymond Holt is as smart as anyone in this department, but he chooses to use his intelligence to make our city a better place.
One day, I hope to live up to the standard you set.
You make me want to have a wetter brain.
Oh, Kevin.
Y'all are hella specific.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
1  So you guys are gonna tie up the only microwave for 20 minutes to make a frozen lasagna?
- Ballsy.
- You ignorant loser.
First of all, it's not just a frozen lasagna, it's a Mama Magglione's.
Second of all, it's gonna take 21 1/2 minutes.
The box says 20, but we know better than the box.
You see, this microwave is a KitchenPro Max.
- Bit of a lightweight.
- It's only 1.2 kilowatts.
- Fine for popcorn.
- But we're talking about a Mama Magglione's here.
Takes a lot to get mama hot.
She's a real size-queen.
Well, that started out fun, and here we are at our normal ending place: disgusting.
Uh-oh.
Guys!
We have a major problem here.
- No garlic bread.
- Okay, we need to stay calm.
Let's think.
The garlic bread needs to go in the toaster oven with eight minutes left on the lasagna.
Maybe we could run down to the corner store and make it in time.
That just gives us 12 minutes to go to a place and come back.
Mama Magglione.
We have to go now!
Okay, well, good luck with that, weirdos.
Stupid piece of crap.
Rosa, come on.
You can't break a mouse in half.
-  - Oh, wow, you did.
Scary.
You really earn your rep.
Stupid Internet.
The network's been down all morning, and my girlfriend - Jocelyn.
- Right.
She's leaving town for two weeks.
Oh, is Jocelyn leaving town?
Where is Jocelyn going?
Dude, you forgot her name one time.
It's not a big deal.
You don't have to keep - proving you remember it.
-  That's not what's happening here.
I'm just saying it a lot, because she's so important to me.
- Okay, what's her last name?
- Uh-oh.
- Mm-hmm.
It's Pryce.
- Right.
She's leaving town for two weeks.
I want to send flowers to her hotel room.
Aww, that's sweet.
I wish Amy would send me flowers.
Why is it taking Holt and this I.T. guy so long to fix the Internet?
One Police Plaza sent him an hour ago.
Huh.
Why does Holt look so worried?
What are you talking about?
He looks exactly like he always does.
To you, perhaps, but I finally learned how to read his emotions.
His lips are slightly pursed, and he's blinking at eight-second intervals as opposed to his normal 10.
Oh, my God.
He's having a meltdown.
"Meltdown" seems excessive.
Yeah, it's a meltdown.
Mark my words.
Hey, there, Captain.
Everything okay?
No, I'm having a meltdown.
Props.
That was amazing.
- Thanks.
It was a lot of work.
- This is Sergeant Knox.
From Cyber Operations.
He's discovered the reason for our network issues.
A hacker is attempting to break into our servers.
Not all of them.
Just the LACMI server.
- Well, that's good.
- No, Captain Holt's nostril - just twitched.
It's bad.
- It's devastating.
- Props again.
- Thanks, again.
The LACMI server holds clearance-protected information, including the names of our undercover agents.
If it's compromised, people could lose their lives.
Okay, but isn't the server secure?
Yes, but the hacker's already used an ARP to resolve the host name with the DNS server.
Uh-huh.
ARP.
DNS.
Totally following what you're saying.
Right now, they're trying to get root access by connecting the OSI network to the data-link.
You know, I'm a bit of a computer nerd myself, but could you, maybe dumb it down a bit for my friends here?
They're almost through our defenses.
If we can't stop them, they'll be inside of our server in 19 minutes.
Mama Magglione.
A countdown clock, green text on a black background: we are in full-on action-movie mode.
Now all I need is my no-nonsense captain to tell me to focus, because time is running out.
- Peralta.
- Yes?
You have something in your teeth.
It's, uh, quite off-putting.
What?
No.
"Time is running out".
I fed you your line.
No one ever has something in their teeth in a movie.
Watch a movie, stupid Holt.
Damn it, I tried to remove the server from the chain, but the hacker blocked the protocol.
Why don't you just unplug it?
That's what I do any time I'm having computer trouble.
And also I code a lot.
Java, mainframe.
This guy knows what I'm talking about.
The NYPD servers have internal backup batteries.
Even if we unplug them, they'll stay on for another two hours.
As a captain, I have an override code I can use to wipe the servers clean so there'd be no information for the hackers to steal, but there's one problem, Jake.
- Yes, sir?
- You still have something in your teeth.
You tried to get rid of it, but it's made it much more prominent.
Why would you stop everything just to tell me that?
It's very distracting.
Anyway, I can't use my override code, because doing so would delete the entire evidence tracking database.
The NYPD only backs up that information at the precinct level twice a year.
We would lose four months of evidence.
So what you're saying is that every perp awaiting trial would walk free?
Exactly, and we have hundreds of open cases.
Wiping the servers is not an option.
The only solution is to track down the hacker.
How?
It could be anywhere in the world Osaka, Berlin, Macau, Stockholm.
Are you guys just gonna keep letting me list cities - I've lived in?
- Wait, the LACMI server isn't wired to the Internet.
It's supposed to be offline.
How are they accessing it?
They must be going through a physical AP.
Again, these guys don't get computers like you and I, so It's not a remote connection.
The hacker's inside the building.
Let's mobilize.
Nobody in or out of the building without authorization.
Check every inch of every floor.
- And, Jake.
- Oh, let me guess.
It's on another tooth now.
Is it somehow on my face?
No, what I was going to say is, we only have 15 minutes left.
You need to focus, because time is running out.
Oh, yeah.
That's what the F I'm talking about.
Thank you, sir.
-  - What's all this?
Drunken brawl broke out between to sororities.
We're keeping the Lambda Nus up here, and the Kappa Gamma Kappas are in holding on two.
- They're all so mean.
- They're kids, Boyle.
I'm sure they're just scared.
Yeah, we're just scared kids.
Can we please go home now?
I'm sorry, we have to process you, but I promise we'll go as fast as we can.
I hope you get shot in the line of duty.
- Oh, my God.
- All right.
Brush it off, Sarge, we've got an emergency.
There's a hacker in the building.
Look for anyone you don't recognize using a computer, or plugged in to a port.
I initiated lockdown protocol.
I'll search the fourth floor.
Peralta, Diaz, start on one, work your way up.
Jeffords, take Boyle, start on three, - work your way down.
- On it.
I'll grab the keys to the first floor.
- Smart.
-  Ames, I love you, but I can't talk right now.
I just got an alert that the Nine-Nine is on lockdown.
- I'm on my way.
- Wait, aren't you at the dentist?
Yeah, I left.
It's fine.
It's a new hygienist, and to be honest, her scraping technique was a joke.
We have 14 minutes to find a hacker.
You're not gonna get back in time.
But everybody else is there, right?
I mean, it seems weird to have this big thing happen without me.
We talked about this, Amy.
You have an unhealthy fear of missing out on work.
- You have FOMOW.
- This isn't FOMOW.
It's not like I'm freaking out or anything.
Out of my way, you old bitch!
This cab is mine.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
I love you.
Don't solve it without me.
I got the keys.
Let's go.
- Jocelyn.
- Jocelyn Pryce, hey.
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the airport?
Yeah, uh, I wanted to stop and see you on the way there.
- I think we need to talk.
- Why?
Is something wrong?
I should've done this last night, but I chickened out.
We need to break up.
Ugh.
Mama Magglione.
You want to break up?
But I just met your college friends.
Are you telling me I had to talk to Matt for nothing?
- Rosa.
- I thought you liked Matt.
Matt is a nightmare.
He kept saying "hashtag tell me about it".
We should really get going.
Listen, I just don't understand why this is happening.
Look, I love being with you, but how often am I actually with you?
- We're together every night.
- Unless you're at work, or doing work, or thinking about work.
It's like you never have time for me.
I'm sorry, but Rosa doesn't have time for you.
We have a really important work thing.
That was bad.
Let me try rephrasing it.
You are not as important as Rosa's job.
Oh, wow.
That was way worse.
Look, we just have to take care of this one thing.
It's an emergency.
Then I'll be right back and we can talk about this.
I really have to get to the airport.
- Please.
- Okay, fine.
But I'm leaving in 10 minutes.
Okay, just wait in the break room.
Don't sit on the couch.
It's full of farts.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm great.
I love being dumped.
It's super great.
I think you're being sarcastic, but it's hard to tell with your voice the way it always is.
We just checked the third floor.
We didn't find anyone.
- We're on our way to one.
- You didn't even start yet?
Rosa took a long time getting ready.
You know how ladies be preppin'.
Ow!
I was just covering up the truth so it wouldn't be awkward.
Ooh, did something awkward happen?
I can probably relate.
Dish, bish.
Rosa got dumped out of the blue because she cares so much about her job and doesn't spend enough time with Jocelyn.
Ow!
There's no winning with you.
Oh, so you got dumped, and you didn't see it coming.
Oh, brother, you are in Boyle Country.
Here's what you're gonna want to do.
- Come on, Boyle.
- Beg her to take you back, and don't be afraid to cry.
I'm talking tears and snot.
Quinn, did you get the alert?
Yeah, but I haven't seen anyone unusual down here.
I mean, other than 1,000 Kappa Gamma Kappas.
At least you didn't have to deal with Lambda Nus.
Those girls are savages.
Right?
We're the victims here.
We have a nighttime event, and if we don't make our blowouts, then we'll all look disgusting, and nobody will give any money to the kids, or dogs, or whatever the charity is.
It's to buy shoes for poor people so they can get jobs.
- Yeah.
- We'll do our best, but it's possible you're gonna miss your event.
That's too bad, 'cause you could use some decent shoes.
What?
Terry got these at Aldo.
- Was it buy one, get one?
- No, it wasn't.
It was a three-for-one Labor Day doorbuster.
- Makes sense.
- Come on.
Nobody on the fourth floor.
Three is clear.
We're finishing up two.
I gotta get out of here before the sorority girls notice my tie.
Just regroup in my office.
- Go for Hitch.
- Hitchcock, damn it.
I meant to call Peralta.
We're in the middle of a crisis.
- Oh, no.
Is it the lasagna?
- The what?
Don't play dumb with me, Raymond.
What's wrong with the lasagna?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
What is it?
What's wrong with the lasagna?
- Is it bubbling over?
- He won't tell me.
Captain, give us the damned information.
Is it bubbling over?
I don't have time for these shenanigans.
- What's the problem?
- He wouldn't say.
Oh, no.
Then it must be bad.
Call Jake.
He'll tell us the truth.
- Hitchcock?
- Give it to us straight, man.
- What's going on?
- Uh, just searching - the first floor.
- Searching the first floor?
Why is the lasagna on the first floor?
Why is the lasagna on the first floor?
What?
Are you talking about?
The lasagna is fine.
Oh, thank God.
He says it's fine.
Oh, you're a saint, Jakey.
I love you.
Okay.
Holt's texting me.
Love you, too.
Rosa!
We gotta go up to Holt's.
Is this not done yet?
Ugh.
Jocelyn leaves in eight minutes, and I don't want things to end like this.
Wow.
Way to be vulnerable.
I thought for sure you'd write her off the second she said she wanted to break up.
Yeah, I did.
She's dead to me.
Wait?
Then why are you so anxious to get back up and talk to her?
Because I have a plan.
I'm gonna beg her to stay, change whatever it is I need to change, then once our relationship is stronger than ever, I'm gonna dump her ass so quick.
It's gonna be brutal.
Okay, I'm gonna try and put this nicely.
That is psychotic.
Okay, maybe not psychotic, but it's like something the lady from "Killing Eve" would do.
Not Sandra Oh, Villanelle.
You know, the crazy one who stabs everyone with her hairpin.
But have you still not watched "Killing Eve"?
I've told you about it so many times.
Look, I've never lost a breakup, and I'm not starting now.
I'm 12-0.
I'm always the dumper, never the dumpee.
I just don't think every breakup has a winner and a loser.
Sounds like somebody who's lost all his breakups.
Not all.
Maybe like half, max.
Just being generous.
Hey, Ames.
Cab was too slow.
Decided to walk.
It's nice to take a little stroll.
You're clearly running at full speed.
Whatever.
- How's it going there?
- Not great.
We still haven't found the hacker.
Oh, super.
I mean oh, no.
- Is Amy FOMOWing?
- Of course not.
Big time.
Okay, I gotta go, babe.
We're headed to Holt.
Don't you dare hang up on me!
I am part of this.
Rosa, this is dumb.
I'm just gonna go.
No, no, no.
You promised me more time.
I still have seven minutes.
I really don't want to miss my flight, and I cannot physically stand the way that room smells anymore.
Just breathe through your mouth.
Please, just stay here.
I'll be right back.
We searched everywhere.
- No hacker.
- Maybe he camouflaged himself.
Maybe he's a real-life Peeta Mellark, out there - looking like a river rock.
- I hate to say it, but maybe it's time we start thinking - about erasing the server.
- No, not until the last possible minute.
- What else can you do?
- I've been trying to pinpoint him.
I've been making my way through the server sockets, trying to determine which port he's plugged into.
What's going on?
I can't hear anything.
Turn me around.
I'm missing everything.
Part of the team.
What's up, team?
Is Sergeant Santiago suffering from FOMOW?
- No.
-  -  - What's happening?
I think the hacker just opened the holding cell.
Mama Magglione.
Oh, no.
They're running free.
Everyone, cover up your worst physical attributes.
It's no use.
They could always find new ones.
Why would the hacker open the holding cell?
Maybe he's trying to create a distraction.
I think he can see that I'm closing in on his location.
Then keep doing that.
The rest of you, get them back into holding.
Oh, come on.
Get down from there.
Do you know who my father is?
He's in business.
That's where you actually make money at your job.
I make money.
I make good money.
That can't be true.
Otherwise, you wouldn't still have that chin.
What?
Nobody ever said anything about my chin?
Boyle, is something wrong with Terry's chin?
- I don't want to get involved.
- Oh, my God.
It's true.
How is she running so fast in those shoes?
She's too drunk to feel any pain.
- Open up.
- No.
You are trapped in a very small room, and we can see you.
What's your plan here?
Shut up, I'm trying to think.
If you come in here, I'll bite you with this weird mouth thing.
That is a staple remover, and it's shocking you don't know that.
Sorry, I'm not a secretary.
I don't have time for this.
My girlfriend leaves in three minutes.
You are ruining my life.
You're ruining my life.
I missed my Drybar appointment without calling to cancel first.
They keep record of those things.
Oh, my God, neither of your lives are being ruined.
I told you I'm not on board with your psycho plan to destroy your girlfriend.
I'm not gonna destroy her.
I actually want her back.
I really love her, Jake.
What?
Rosa, then why'd you say all that stuff about winning the breakup?
Because it's weak and humiliating to love someone.
I lied to make myself feel strong and normal.
Right, that's definitely what came across, how normal you were being.
Don't let her go.
You guys, I used to have this boyfriend, Jason, then we broke up 'cause I got drunk at Spring Fling and passed out in a bush, and he took too long to find me, and now he's gone and it's like, there's no one to find me when I pass out in a bush.
I'm not sure that totally applies here.
No, she's right.
I can't let Jocelyn go.
Can you handle this without me?
Yeah, it's under control.
Go get Jocelyn back.
Jocelyn Pryce.
Do you need to use a phone to make a call?
Gross, I don't know any phone numbers.
Where the hell did Jocelyn go?
Elevator.
Tears and snot.
-  -  Where are you going?
I still have one minute left.
I'm leaving because it's clearer to me than ever that your job is more important to you than I am.
That's not true!
Sorry, ma'am, I can't let anyone in or out.
She's with me.
You don't even apologize blow me off.
You just text "Double homicide TTYL".
Sometimes I add those little heart emojis.
You know how uncomfortable that is for me.
I'm sorry.
My job is hard.
Yeah, it is, and it's important, and you help people, but I need more.
I promise I'll try.
Honestly, I just don't see it changing.
Move, move, move!
Oh, no, why are you outside?
Is it over?
Did we catch the hacker?
No, I have a personal thing that's more important to me.
Oh, yeah, work-life balance.
I have that, too.
- Sorry, I can't - Andrew, it's me!
Come on, come on, come on.
Got it.
What?
- Time check.
- Five minutes, ten seconds.
- It's over.
- Don't say that.
We'll never get the garlic bread toasted in time.
- We can, and we will.
- How?
We'll set the oven to 500.
Are you insane?
It'll burn.
We'll wrap it in foil.
The foil will stick to the cheese.
That's a risk we'll have to take.
Move it.
- Hey, you made it.
- Yeah.
We finally got all the Lambda Nus back into holding.
Who are the Lambda Nus?
Doesn't matter.
I'll read your notes later.
I didn't take any notes.
What the hell, Jake?
Do you even love me?
Says the woman who never once sent me flowers.
Never mind, uh, we still haven't found the hacker, but the cyber guy is getting close.
Okay, let's check in with Holt.
Hold on to him, girl.
He seems pretty sweet, and you guys are like both sevens.
Oh, come on.
We only have two minutes left.
I'm telling you, I can't find him.
Captain, maybe it's time to face reality.
We have to erase the servers.
I'll initiate the sequence for you.
It just needs your passcode.
Perhaps you're right.
How depressing.
I never would've thought that typing an intricate sequence of numbers from memory would bring such sadness.
Hi, I'm Sergeant Santiago.
I'm sure these guys have told you all about me already.
Long story short, nothing happens around here without me.
-  - What is that?
We just got an NOS ping from the first floor.
The hacker is in room 103.
Mama Magglione.
Go, go!
Room 103!
What are we gonna do?
It's still frozen in the middle!
Well, then turn up the temp.
It's already at 500.
It's maxed out.
Then set the mother to broil!
Okay!
Geez.
I thought you said you searched the entire first floor.
I did.
I even checked the ceiling for clingers.
Hey, who's that guy from Cyber?
Sergeant Knox.
We've been talking computers all day.
Pretty technical stuff.
I kept up.
His face is really familiar.
I can't place him.
It's empty.
And there's nothing plugged in to the Internet port.
But Knox said he got a NOS ping.
I mean, NOSes don't just ping themselves, guys.
Jake, stop.
You're not fooling anybody.
You don't anything about computers.
Oh, my God.
You're right.
I'm not fooling anybody.
I was fooled, Jakey.
You're my computer boy.
No, no, no.
I don't know anything about computers.
None of us do.
And Knox could tell that.
So he knew that we wouldn't catch on if he just made stuff up.
What if the reason we can't find the hacker is because there is no hacker?
Why would Knox lie about that?
What if he doesn't actually care what's on the LACMI servers?
Maybe his real goal is to just trick Holt into erasing all the servers.
He might just be trying to delete some evidence.
So you think he's a criminal.
Oh, my God.
We have to go right now.
I know how I know Knox.
He's the guy from the security footage in the Avery Street murder.
Are you sure?
Yes, he shaved his beard, but it's definitely him.
- We have less than a minute.
- Call Holt.
Knox is right next to him.
He'll hear everything.
Here, I'll text him.
I don't get it.
Holt was about to erase the servers.
If that's what Knox wanted, why did he stop him and say the hacker was in room 103?
I don't know.
Maybe to get rid of us.
No, to get rid of you.
The second you showed up in Holt's office, he sent us away and the holding cell doors, they opened when I walked in with Amy on my phone.
He must've known that she would recognize him.
Why is this taking so long to send?
What's going on?
We're running out of time here.
Uh, sorry, it's uh from my husband, Kevin.
Well, all due respect, but you don't have time for that.
You've got 15 seconds before the hacker is inside the server.
Uh, yes, uh it's just that Kevin just texted me some hot goss about our favorite reality TV star.
10 seconds.
Your agents' lives are at stake.
- Eight, seven - Oh, I understand.
I just have to find out about the hot goss.
"How certain are you?
Sincerely, Raymond Holt".
"100 percent, sincerely" Why am I doing that part?
Send.
Okay, it said delivered.
Make way, make way.
Peralta, Santiago, you'll be happy to know that I did not erase the server.
Oh, thank God.
But sad to know that Knox caught on and is now holding me at gunpoint.
Why not lead with that?
Nobody has to get hurt.
Just put your guns down, and put your hands in the air.
Hey!
I said put your guns down, and get your hands in the air.
The bread, it's gonna burn.
Guys, do what he says.
I'll buy you all the garlic bread you want.
We're gonna hold you to that, Sarge.
Knox, you're pointing a gun at an NYPD captain.
Have you really thought this through?
This is not my fault.
You were supposed to be at the dentist.
What?
How did you You called me.
He called me.
He said he had a tip for the officer in charge of the Avery murder.
I said I could meet any time except for this morning because of the dentist.
I had it all planned out.
Guess you didn't count on my FOMOW.
Yeah, that's right.
It's crippling.
Oh, picking a weird time, but I'm glad you're finally owning it.
Here's what's gonna happen.
The captain and I are gonna walk out of here real slow.
No one's gonna move a muscle.
Everyone's gonna be okay.
Now we're just gonna move.
He's down.
He's down.
We got him.
Jeffords, get him into holding.
With pleasure.
You're about to have a really bad day.
Give me that.
Look at his pants, ladies.
They're relaxed fit.
Uh-oh.
Is that a braided belt?
Whoa, what happened?
You know what, forget it.
I'll just read Amy's notes.
Why aren't you guys on your way to the airport?
Oh, I'm gonna miss my flight, but it's worth it.
It means a lot that Rosa bailed on all this just for me.
- Aww.
- You did what, Diaz?
Now, sir, I told her it was okay.
If you're gonna be mad at anyone, be mad at me.
Okay, I am mad at you.
What?
No.
I didn't think you were really gonna be mad.
That's that backfired.
Be mad at Rosa.
Worst morning ever.
Yeah, it was stressful, but we got the guy.
Surprised you two are taking it so hard.
We were talking about our lunch, you self-absorbed son-of-a-bitch.
- Come on.
- Look at this bread.
It's completely inedible.
There's not even any soft parts in the middle we can pull out.
Title of your sex tape?
We cooked that lasagna for nothing.
- Nothing!
- Okay.
But have you ever considered eating lasagna with no garlic bread?
We've Never done that before.
I guess maybe we could give it a try.
What do you think, Hitchcock?
What the hell.
I had a feeling something crazy was gonna happen today.
There you go.
It's almost ready.
Mama Magglione.
Mmm.
Mmm.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
1  Confucius, Buddha, Jesus they all brought light to darkness.
But none of them had one million subscribers, so They can suck it!
Your videos changed my life!
Changed my life!
You are my qu-qu-queen!
-  - No, Italian girl.
We are changing the world, for we are the G-Hive.
And today we are celebrating our 1 millionth subscriber.
Over 1 million people are living their lives according to the Gina-mandments.
They're like the Ten Commandments, only there's more and they're better.
I would now like to express my gratitude the best way I know how through song.
Gratitude  Grati-tat-tat-tat tatitude!
Grati-tat-tat-tat-tatitude!
Gratitude.
Guys?
Guess who I just got off the phone with.
My cousin Pam.
What?
No.
Why would you think that?
You always seemed kind of jealous of my relationship with him, so I thought maybe you called him up to settle your differences.
I'm definitely not jealous of Pam.
He owns a bird shop.
I barely remember him.
You remember the bird shop.
It wasn't Pam.
No, I was actually talking to none other than Gina Linetti.
Really?
No one's heard from her in months.
Well, she just invited us to go check out her new place.
I'm surprised you're so excited to see her.
I mean, she's been blowing you off ever since she left.
- What?
In what way?
- She bailed - on your birthday drinks.
- It wasn't that fun.
She was a no-show at your Secret Santa party!
Christmas is overrated.
- She hasn't called you in months!
- I'm not that interesting.
Look, what is going on with you?
- Are you hangry?
- No.
I just ate six hardboiled eggs.
Well, maybe you should've made it a cool "doz".
Look, I know Gina hasn't been around very much, but we're gonna spend time with her today, and it's gonna be just like old times.
Gina's gonna be a few minutes.
Her photo shoot is running over.
Yes, Moses!
Lookin' good!
Now work those Commandments!
See, Sarge?
Just like old times.
Ah, Boyle, there you are.
I have a question for you.
Daddy, wait up!
Oh, your non-adult is at our place of work Nikolaj had a half-day at school for Mariano Rivera's birthday.
I'm watching him on my lunch break.
Nikolaj, say "hi" to Captain Holt.
Hi, Captain Holt!
How's Mr. Kevin?
Stressed.
His annual budget review is today, and a recent change in federal policy means his grant situation is tenuous.
- At best.
- Okay.
Hey Nikolaj, Daddy and Captain Holt need to talk.
Why don't you go do some drawing?
Oh, he loves doing art.
He made a portrait of our dog Biscuit that had all of his surgical scars.
Yes.
Children are wonders.
I'm conducting a statistical analysis to get a more nuanced understanding of which areas in our jurisdiction need greater police presence with a hope of developing a formula that What on Walden Pond is this?
Nikolaj, no, that's important!
I'm so sorry, sir.
I don't spank him, but I will reprimand him in my own way.
Niko.
I love you.
- I'm so sorry, Daddy!
- No, no, no.
He didn't ruin it, he solved it.
The absolute value of psi.
Nikolaj cracked the equation.
Boyle your boy is a genius!
Jacob!
Terrencio!
Give Moses a hug!
Uhh!
It's so good to see you!
Ugh, that shoot took forever.
Did Janelle offer you a snack?
She did.
I had Linguini.
So what's been going on with you?
Well, that's actually why I called.
It's not a big deal at all, but someone's threatening to murder me.
- What?
- Damn, Gina!
I mean, I'm not worried about it in the slightest.
Anyone who has an online presence gets meaningless threats.
It actually is a sign that I made it.
- Congrats?
- Thanks, thank you.
The only thing is, I have my first speaking engagement tomorrow and the organizer says he's going to cancel it unless I have police protection, so would you guys come tomorrow and police protect me?
- Yes, of course, yes.
- Oh, thanks so much.
This is my agent.
I'm so sorry.
Duncan, this better be good news.
Oh, it is your video's huge, from Spokane to Spain, you're global, Gines!
Now, let's.
Talk.
Strategy.
This is gonna take a while.
Do you guys want to get drinks at Shaw's later and catch up?
Oh, yeah.
That sounds really fun.
Great.
I'll see you then!
- Okay.
- So, Duncs, I have an idea for a second book.
It's a memoir, and it's made of memes.
So, it's called a meme-oir.
Whoa, Rosa!
What happened?
I touched poison oak.
The doctor says I have to keep my hands bandaged for a week so I don't scratch them.
- How did it happen?
- I was on a nature hike and I went off-trail to pick a pretty little flower.
Shut up.
Now scram.
I have a case report to type up.
Uh, there's no way you're using a keyboard with your hands like that.
Oh, I could help you!
Not to brag, but at typing camp, everyone called me "The Finger Queen".
Oh, my God, that sounds really dirty.
I swear that's what it meant.
Yeah, it was typing camp.
Nobody thinks that.
Anyway, I don't need your help.
You're really gonna try to make it through an entire day on your own?
Well, well, well.
Rosa Diaz is finally gonna learn the lesson that no matter how strong she is on her own, true strength comes from accepting help from others That's not what's happening.
Mm-hmm, yeah.
That's how normal people take their coats off.
I'm fine.
- I can see that.
- This is going well.
Clearly.
Why are you sliding into my side of the booth?
Because that side is the solo side.
You always put the person you want catch up with on the solo side, otherwise one of us will spend the whole night straining our necks looking sideways.
I'm straining my neck talking to you right now.
Okay, so don't look at me, Terry.
Just face forward.
You see me every day.
- Fine.
- Fine.
I gotta say, I'm surprised Gina invited us to drinks tonight.
She obviously invited us over to her place because she needed a favor.
Why are you still so down on her?
I've been through this before.
In college, I had a football buddy, Bryant Ungerbert Oh, lemme guess.
You guys were best friends, then he got drafted into the NFL, - and now you never talk.
- No, he got drafted into the Canadian football league, became a long snapper for Ottawa, and even that level of success ruined our friendship.
He's still playing?
How is that possible?
You're 35 to 60 years old.
It's Canada.
They don't tackle as hard.
Anyway, his career became the only thing that mattered.
He was off doing photo shoots, commercials, speaking at long snapping conventions - Is that a thing?
- In Canada, it's like the Oscars.
Look, the point is he stopped making time for his friends.
Fine, but that's not what's happening here.
Nothing has changed with Gina.
- She's not an Ungerbert.
- Hi.
So, Gina won't be able to make it tonight.
She doesn't have time.
But here are your credentials for tomorrow's event.
Have a great night.
Oh, no.
She is an Ungerbert.
Hey, Gina's prepping inside.
You get some rest last night?
Yeah, because I got home from our 9:30 drinks at 9:41.
I was in bed by 10:00.
Then I looked at my phone for another two hours, so actually I didn't sleep very well.
But I did realize something.
The only thing that matters to Gina is work.
You don't say?
Where have I heard that before?
I don't know, Terry.
I don't have time for your weird memory lapse.
I said it last night.
Well, I wish you would've said it to me.
Anyway, I decided I'm not gonna let it go this time After we update her on the case, - I'm gonna say something to her.
- Good.
I wish I'd have said something to Ungerbert.
Long snapper used to be my favorite position.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Hmm.
Well you a weirdo.
TimothÃ©e Chalamet, shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.
TimothÃ©e Chalamet, shimmy-yah, shimmy-yay.
- Gina.
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm doing my vocal warm-up.
- Great.
Well, cyber looked into the threats, and they traced a number of negative comments back to another internet celebrity, Marvin Lennox.
Marvin Lennox.
Yeah, I'm not worried about him.
- He's an inspirational baker.
- Inspirational baker?
What the hell is that?
A man is like a quiche, and a quiche is only as strong as its crust.
What's your crust?
Oh, that's exactly what it sounds like.
Yeah, he's not a threat.
He lives in Utah, and again, just to remind you inspirational baker.
Right.
Well, even so, we have metal detectors at all of the entrances, and we'll keep our eyes peeled for anything suspicious.
Also, before we head in there, I wanted to talk to you about something.
- What's up?
- Well, it just kind of bummed me out that last night you blew us off.
For work.
Again.
What?
Uh, no.
I did not miss drinks for work.
I had food poisoning.
Did Janelle not tell you?
- No.
- Wow, that's crazy.
'Cause I specifically told her to tell you you know what?
- I'm gonna fire her.
- You don't have to do that.
- Janelle.
- Oh, God, doing it now?
- Hi, Gina.
- Okay.
Well, Sarge and I should probably hit it, get back in there, survey some people.
But have a great show.
Janelle, just remember you're gonna have a lot of jobs in your life this is but a blip on your rÃ©sumÃ©.
Okay Sarge, let's go.
Wanted to see me, sir?
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about Nikolaj.
How long have you known he was a genius?
I mean, I always knew he was bright.
I just never realized he was that smart Well, there's no sugarcoating it.
- You're a terrible father.
- What?
!
You've been asleep at the wheel, man!
What have you done to cultivate his incredible mind?
- I read to him every night.
- Shakespeare?
Tolstoy?
- No, nothing that advanced.
- Egads, are you reading him Dickens?
- Yes?
- Boyle!
My father never saw my potential.
In grade school, I wanted to spend all my free time drawing graphs and charts, but he insisted I play basketball.
As if I care about slam dunking a three-pointer.
Don't be my father, Boyle!
I wouldn't dare!
What do you think I should do?
Let me tutor Nikolaj.
Nothing too strenuous.
Maybe some geometry, statistical mechanics, perhaps some Latin lyric poetry thrown in for fun.
Oh, I don't know.
He's really booked.
I guess I could cancel his cartooning class, - but he really loves it.
- Don't do that.
I hate to think of all the great cartoons humanity missed out on because Einstein was just too busy reinventing physics.
Okay, I'll cancel the class.
I mean, who needs relativity when we could've had Einstein's take on lasagna-eating cats.
- I said I'd cancel.
- Did he hate Mondays?
We'll never know.
Okay, I'm going, I'm going!
Ugh, why won't this dumb monitor turn on?
Because you can't work without your hands.
Trust us.
If you could do this job without lifting a finger, we would've already cracked it.
Because we're lazy boys.
I'm just not doing it hard enough.
-  Mmm!
- Ooh!
That's a double-sponger.
All right.
I am cleaning this up, and no one is helping me.
Not a problem.
Because we're lazy boys.
You gotta be kidding me!
-  - In the beginning, there was nothing.
And then God, a woman, said, "Let there be Gina"!
Gina!
Please look at me!
You're welcome.
Aaaaah!
It's gonna be hard to spot a crazy person in here.
- They're all crazy.
- Tell me about it.
This is more insane than the crowd at the Carly Rae Jepsen I mean Slayer concert.
G-Hive!
Are you ready for three new Gina-mandments?
-  - Number one.
You can be anything you set your mind to as long as you're already great at it!
Number two.
No one knows you can't take it with you!
Be buried with your money.
Cha-ching!
Number three.
If you fall down nine times you gotta reassess your walking, 'cause something's wrong.
And now, I wanna hear from you, my baby G-Hive!
Yes, girl in the mustard sweater.
Hi, Gina.
I just quit my job and left my husband who loves parkour more than he loves me.
And it's all because of your Gina-mendment: "If the light in your house is dim, change the bulb".
Yes!
I have time for 15 more compliments.
Hey, Jake.
I think Lennox is here.
I see him.
You get him.
I'll stick with Gina.
Uh-oh.
He's moving.
Coming through.
There's too many hoodies.
I lost him.
- Get Gina out of here, now!
- And now the time has come for yâall to meditate.
Close your eyes while I sing to you.
Breathe in, breathe out I invented meditation - R - Gina, we gotta go.
- Lennox is here.
- Told you I'm not worried about Lennox.
Well, it's not your call.
- We're leaving.
- Jake, you're overreacting.
On second thought, maybe we should get out of here.
- Okay.
Kitchen's all clear.
- Bedroom's clear.
Can't believe I just escaped death!
I haven't felt this alive since I almost got killed by that bus.
I know, right?
What a rush.
Feel just like Kevin Costner in "The Bodyguard"!
What?
If anyone's like Kevin Costner it's me.
I'm the one carrying Gina!
Well, I think we can agree we were both Kevin Costner.
- No!
- Jake, that was so dope when you were like, "Clear a path"!
-  - Guys, uniformed officers found Marvin hiding in a bathroom at the event space.
He's in custody.
We got him!
That's great!
I hope they give him the chair.
Ooh, we should celebrate.
Champagne's in the fridge.
On it.
Duncan, I almost died.
It was amazing.
I heard all about it, Gines.
Look, you're trending!
And from my pain comes triumph!
Love that.
And we can use this publicity to get more money out of those bottled water guys.
You really impressed them at drinks last night!
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah we should talk about this later.
Sorry, you're breaking up.
Look, I said they loved you at the drinks last night the drinks last night that you had with the water people?
Crap, I just hit the Holland Tunnel, but again,  great job with the drinks last night!
Bye.
Jake, did you hear that?
I did, and there's been a change of plans.
I'm gonna take a rain check on the champagne, but it was wonderful seeing you.
Why are you talking like a flight attendant?
This is how I always talk when everything is okay.
Which it is right now.
Please enjoy the rest of your day.
How did Nikolaj do?
Were you able to overcome - my horrible parenting?
- No, it's far worse than I could've ever imagined.
I showed him a periodic table, and he thought it was a coloring book illustration.
I blame myself.
It's such a classic Boyle trait not to recognize talent.
My cousin Susan didn't know she could sing until her late 40s.
Honestly, given the hole that you've put him in, he needs more expert help than I can provide.
But, there is a boarding school in Switzerland that would be a perfect fit for him.
He can enroll immediately.
In Switzerland?
I'd never see him.
Then uproot your life and move there with him.
No one here would miss you.
Hmm.
We could live in Gruyere, the fondue capital of the world.
Oh, I don't know.
It's such a big change.
Well, he's the genius.
Why don't we ask him what he wants to do?
Good point.
Niko?
We need to talk.
Wait.
Why is he writing the solution to my formula for no reason?
And why is he drawing colorful underpants beneath it?
Oh, I see what's happening.
He's drawing Boy Riga, loyal sidekick to his favorite cool superhero, Captain Latvia.
That's his symbol.
He distributes grain evenly among the working class.
Uh-huh.
I see.
So this was all just some coincidence.
He wasn't writing absolute value of psi.
He was just doodling.
Aaaah!
Raaah!
Uhhh!
Ahhh!
Rosa?
Are you stuck in there?
No, I'm in here by choice.
Oh, 'cause I hear some banging noises as if someone was struggling to open the door.
No.
That was the pipes.
Or, is it the sound of you learning how to ask for help?
You know, you can't spell "independent" without "dependent".
And you can't spell "Go  yourself" without " you.
Jake, I had a work thing.
I can't believe you're being such a baby about this.
I'm not being a baby.
Look, I'm sorry I lied, okay?
It was a big opportunity for me.
I was having drinks with the brand director of a bottled water company.
I can't say which one, but it rhymes with, "fart water".
Perhaps one day I will laugh at that.
In the meantime, I'm happy for all your success.
I hope your partnership with "fart water" is very fruitful.
- Good day.
- Come on, dude.
- Just talk to me.
- I would if we were friends, but you're making it it very clear that we are not, so I shan't.
- Oh, you're shanting me?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Jake!
- Can't hear you.
- You're shanted!
- Jake!
I told you I only talk to my friends.
No, Jake.
I think I just got stabbed by that guy.
Oh, yeah, ya did.
Ya definitely did.
Okay.
The ambulance is on its way.
They said not to remove the knife.
Great.
What's up?
I got your text Oh, my God, Gina, there's a knife in you!
Jake, did you stab Gina?
I didn't stab Gina, okay?
Lennox wasn't our guy.
The real perp did it.
He's in a black hoodie and jeans.
He ran that way.
- I'm on it.
- I want you to stay calm and just try to keep all of your blood - inside your body.
- Bitch, what do you think I'm doing?
Yeah, I don't know why I said that.
Bring your ass down here so we can finish our conversation.
We can do that later, Gina.
First of all, I have so much adrenaline pumping through my body right now I can feel almost nothing.
Secondly, you can't say no to me.
- I have a knife in my back.
- Yeah, that tracks.
Okay, fine.
So I was saying that ever since you left you've been kind of a crappy friend.
Brrrrrawwwwwwoo.
We're definitely not having this conversation right now.
No, it's okay.
It just hurt for a sec.
Come on, let's do it.
Ugh.
All right, fine, what was I saying?
You were saying that I'm a  Ahh, bad friend.
Right.
You're a bad friend.
That's what I was saying to you.
- Yeah.
- And just that, you know, you've been really blowing me off for the last few months, and last night you lied to me about being sick.
- That really sucked.
- All right, well, listen.
I'm sorry I lied, Jake.
I saw you were getting upset and I didn't want to hurt you.
But I don't know what to say about the other stuff because this is my life and I don't want to apologize for that.
No, and Gina, you shouldn't have to.
Look, I'm really proud of you.
You're totally killing it.
Yeah, people want to stab me.
I mean, that's a very positive way of - looking at things, but yeah.
- Thank you.
Ha ha ha ha-ha!
Hoo hoo!
I hit a new level of pain Please keep talkin', please keep talkin'!
Okay, look.
I just wanted you to know that I miss you.
Well, I miss you too dude.
Great, so can we agree to see each other like 5% more?
Deal.
Aah!
We're not going to shake it.
Yeah, we'll just take each other at our word.
Oooh!
That's a knife!
That is a knife in my back.
That's so weird to say.
There's a knife in my back.
Boyle, may I speak with you for a minute?
Sure, I was just googling "good toys for normal children".
Nikolaj may not be a genius, but he's a very bright child.
And on top of that, you were right.
He's also a very gifted artist.
Look what he did to my periodic table.
Sure, it's a bit derivative of Kandinsky, but the palette shows an impressive comprehension of color theory.
And he's good at clouds, too.
Okay.
I also wanted to say I was wrong to imply that you didn't know what was best for him.
Oh.
You're an exceptionally supportive parent, and I wish my father had been more like you.
Thank you for saying that.
And sir, nothing would make me prouder than being your big daddy.
Well, we're off track now.
So, uh, good day.
Hey, guys.
How you feeling, Gina?
Sometimes I feel like a nut, sometimes I don't.
Almond Joy's got nuts.
Mounds don't.
She's very hopped up on painkillers.
Hold up, when did you learn French, Monsieur La baguette?
Oh, as a bÃ©bÃ©.
Oh, oui!
Oui, oui, oui, oui.
It actually helps to play along, I'm assuming.
So what's the latest?
Did you catch the perp?
No.
I almost had him.
But then he jumped up, grabbed a flagpole, spun around it like Spider-Man, and then flipped out of sight on a roof.
It was crazy.
Officers are still patrolling the area.
Oh, my God, that's it.
That is it!
The treasure is in the Forest of Enchanted Secrets!
- Let's go!
- No, we can't.
We have to stay here and guard the Amulet of Destiny.
True dat, true dat.
Sarge, call me crazy, but it almost sounds like whoever stabbed Gina knew parkour just like the ex-husband of that lady from Gina's event.
Right!
Gina convinced her to leave him and he probably wants revenge.
- I'll look into it.
- Okay.
Jake, I cannot wait for this doctor.
Will you please grab this knife out of my back?
- Get it!
- Gina, it's already out.
What?
- Hello?
- You win.
- Please help me.
- No.
What, why?
I learned my lesson.
- You were right.
- No, you were right.
For the past four hours, I've been watching you on the security camera.
You have?
That's weird.
- This isn't about me.
- Still seems weird.
Rosa!
Watching you try to open that door and fail again and again and again and again was inspiring!
I was trying to teach you a lesson, and instead, you taught me a lesson.
Great.
What lesson is that?
There is nothing the human spirit cannot overcome.
So Rosa Diaz, you are not quitting.
You are gonna open that door because you are badass and you don't need help from anyone!
Yeah.
I'm Rosa Diaz.
You can do this, Rosa!
Uhhhhh!
She's doing it!
Uhhhhhh!
Yes!
Uhhhhh!
- You did it!
- I did it!
Oh, that was great!
I love being independent - I have to go to the bathroom.
- Oh, okay, I'll help you.
And then you were like, "We can use the Amulet to fight the Queen of Tears"!
I said all of that when I was on drugs?
That's brilliant.
Yeah, we basically came up with an entire amazing story.
- We should write a movie!
- Yes!
Jake and Gina present, colon, "The Queen of Tears," colon, "Battle for the Amulet of Destiny".
Colon, Part One, colon, of Five.
Oh, get those sequel profits smart.
- Yerp.
- Oh, here comes Terry.
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, you should be, Terrance.
You almost missed the surprise we got for you.
- Huh, what is it?
- I think you mean, "Who is it"?
Bryant Ungerbert?
Hello, Terry Jeffords.
It's been far too long, old friend.
We did the right thing.
- Yes we did, Gina.
- Who's Gina?
Are you still on drugs?
- Yeeeah.
- Oh, tight.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
1 Hey, hey hey!
It's the best day of the year.
Happy Cinco de Mayo!
I don't think you're allowed to wear a poncho to work, Hitchcock.
Let's fiesta!
Oh, you got a band.
Stop, stop!
No trumpets!
Not today!
My head is killing me!
Hit the tequila a little early, huh?
I'm not hung over, Hitchcock.
I've got a tension headache.
I've got the Lieutenant's exam tonight.
I'm stress-eating like crazy.
I had ten hard-boiled egg yolks this morning.
- Gross.
- You're having a high-grade pre-test freak out.
I've been there.
March 13, 2001.
AP Calc test Ames, I hate to cut you off, but we all know where this story's going.
Oh, yeah?
You know that I crapped my pants in the middle of the test?
Oh my God, no, I thought you were just gonna say you got a B+ or something.
- More like a BM.
- Noice.
Come on, now Terry's worried about his test and his bowels!
What you need, Sergeant, is to distract yourself.
NPR has a riveting six hour interview with Eileen Moon Myers.
Nobody knows who that is.
Nobody knows the Associate Principal Cellist in the New York Philharmonic?
Okay.
Wait!
I've got it!
I know how to distract Terry.
Captain, remember how you cancelled the last Halloween heist because there was that emergency gas line explosion and you said we had to "help out"?
Yes, I also remember you refusing to believe the explosion was real.
Go back to acting school, buddy.
You're way overselling the pain here.
No one's buying it!
Well, it's not like I was the only one who thought it was fake.
And the Oscar goes to Trent!
You said that we should reschedule the heist for another day, so why not today?
To help distract Terry?
Yes!
And I would love to defend my crown after I destroyed you all last year.
Well, I mean, the proposal was all part of my plan.
All I remember is you bowing to me on your knees.
Yeah, I was asking you to marry me.
Well, you look like a fool.
Neither of you won because Jake swapped out the real championship cummerbund - Belt.
- For the treacly proposal one.
What?
I thought everyone loved that I used the heist to do the proposal.
You are wrong everyone hated it but it helped me win.
During your engagement celebration, I snuck back - and found the original cummerbund.
- Belt.
It's hanging up in my living room at home.
I never thought I'd say this, but enough foreplay!
Are we heisting or not?
- Yes!
- Of course!
Wait, I will only do this under one condition.
Sergeant Jeffords agrees that this will help his nerves.
Yeah, I mean, I would like to take my mind off the test.
And maybe I'll win this year!
Ah, the heist is already working.
Sergeant Jeffords has recovered his sense of humor.
-  - Hey!
All right, but for real, though.
Are we doing this?
- We're doing this!
- Heist!
- Heist!
- Heist!
It's a Cinco de Mayo heist!
A Cinco de Mayo heist makes just as much sense as Halloween!
- Let's do it!
-  Welcome one and all to the first ever Cinco de Mayo Halloween Heist 6!
We're still working on the title.
- No need, I love it!
- Thank you, Charles.
Now, before we go any further, we should probably choose an item to steal.
Does anyone have anything valuable on them?
Maybe some jewelry?
I have a medical alert bracelet that tells people my name and address, in case I have a brain collapse.
Perfect, this year's champion will be whoever's in possession of Scully's very upsetting bracelet at midnight tonight.
- I take my test at 6:30.
- You know what, Terry?
You're kind of making this a nightmare.
Maybe you just shouldn't participate So this really isn't about helping out Sergeant Jeffords?
- What?
- I guess I'm out.
But no, no, no, no, come on.
Of course I'm 100% in support of Terry.
In fact, I'm going to team up with him.
Let's do this!
You are so easily manipulated.
Now you're stuck with Sergeant Dumb Dumb.
- Damn it.
- Hey.
Santiago, shall we join forces?
Ooh, smart, teaming up with the reigning champ.
Again with this nonsense?
I'm the reigning champ.
The only thing you won last heist was a lifetime of mediocre heterosexual intercourse with Jake.
How dare you.
No one thinks you won last year.
Wow, really thought the "how dare you" was going to be linked to his mean sex comment, but okay.
Right, sorry.
I'll have you know Jake and I wear each other out every single night.
Good lord, overcompensating.
You know what?
Maybe we just shouldn't talk about this at work.
I'm texting Kevin to bring the cummerbund.
You'll see who the real winner is, you braggy breeders.
A lot of infighting.
Not too late to ditch Amy and team up with this pussycat burglar.
Please, Boyle, your only value was you had a doppelganger which no longer matters since Bill died in that accident.
- RIP, Bill.
- So sad.
I can still be useful without Bill!
No hole's too tight for these tiny tips.
-  - For stealing stuff!
-  - Well, fine.
Looks like I'll just team up with my friend Rosa.
I'm out.
Five heists was enough.
We've exhausted every possibility of this thing.
Literally nothing new can happen.
It's boring.
You can have a long lunch with me instead.
Ooh, lunch?
The devil's breakfast.
- Well, forget it.
- Okay, I won't call it that!
I just want to be included in something!
Okay, that whole lunch thing was clearly a ploy.
But even still, I'm not worried about losing to Boyle.
No one is.
He's a joke.
All right, let's get this thing going.
Scully will be locked in the supply closet with his bracelet.
Can I lie down on the floor?
Uh, yeah.
You can do whatever you want.
And you're already on the ground.
With Hitchcock.
And you both have pillows.
Best day ever!
There.
Now they're locked in.
Arrange your affairs.
The heist begins in five minutes.
Five minutes?
But this whole thing was so last second!
I don't even have any plans or supplies!
I have so many plans and supplies.
I even have a victory banner that unfurls with a voice command.
I can't say what, but it's so cool.
I thought this was a spur-of-the-moment fun way to distract me from freaking out about my exam!
Well, it wasn't exactly hard to predict, Sarge.
Your catchphrase is "Terry hates tests".
It's true.
Terry hates tests!
But the point is, I planned everything, starting with Scully's bracelet.
It had to be the prize because I have prepared the greatest reveal in heist history.
Allow me to introduce you to Other Scully.
Hi, I'm Earl, Norm's twin brother.
-  - Why's Scully never mentioned he had a twin before?
Because no one talks about their siblings with coworkers.
I've told you about my brother Lawrence.
Nope, and I don't want to learn about him and I already forgot his name.
Now let's go.
It's time to heist!
No movement yet.
So here's our plan.
After watching everyone coo over your maudlin proposal, I've decided we should employ a similar diversion.
- Smart, I'm in.
- You will tell Jake you are pregnant with his child.
What?
I'm not pregnant.
Here is a positive pregnancy test and a sonogram of your fetus.
Congratulations.
It's a girl.
Feels a little mean to play with Jake's feelings - like that, sir.
- You're right, it is mean.
Too bad.
As your mentor I command you to do it.
Wow, okay.
Perhaps we should discuss some other options.
There's no time, look.
Peralta's going for the bracelet!
How'd he get him free so quickly?
See ya later, losers!
Not so fast!
-  -  What the hell was that?
That Fitbit I gave you at Christmas?
I modified it into a taser.
What?
Do you even want me to get into shape?
Yeah, but not as much as I want to win.
Buzz buzz, bitch.
I've got Scully.
Come on, let's go.
-  -  No!
Nooo!
Yes.
Fake heist went perfectly.
So did the real heist.
Why is your face twitching like that?
Oh, Amy tased me a bunch.
I bit my own tongue.
It was awesome.
Was it hard to get through the door?
No.
I'm strong as hell.
The hard part was getting this bracelet off Scully's wrist.
How can you even feel your hand with this thing so tight?
You're supposed to feel your hand?
Well, that's terrifying.
Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to hide the old bracelet and win me this heist.
Don't you mean win us this heist?
Oh, Terrence, unfortunately I do not.
- What the hell?
- Sorry, Sarge.
- It had to be this way.
- Why?
The banner only has my name on it.
It's really all about the banner.
It unfurls by a voice command.
But I promise that I will mention both you and Earl Scully in my victory speech.
- Wait, Earl's here?
- Yeah.
He helped us with the heist.
I told that son of a bitch never to show his face in New York again!
Why are you running towards the glass?
You're a dead man, Earl!
That's not great.
You're a dead man, Jake!
Uh, that's much worse.
Squirt more lube and help me yank.
Ugh, you know that fun braggy recap we do at the end of each win?
Can we leave this part out?
Yes.
We'll make up a cooler thing.
But for now, we lube and yank.
Wrap your legs around him to anchor yourself.
Yep.
Here we go.
Earl?
Earl!
Norm?
- Norm?
- What the I'm so happy your friend invited me to I told you what would happen if I ever saw you again, Earl.
What is going on?
What am I looking at?
Scully has a twin brother named Earl.
Jake brought him here to trick you.
Thank you for the ride, Terrence.
Apparently they don't get along very well.
We did get along.
We were inseparable, until Earl slept with my wife.
It's not my fault she wanted to have sex with a stud instead of a dud.
Stud?
Your face looks it's been kicked in by a horse!
Well, your mouth looks like a butthole!
Your whole body looks like a butthole.
And you look identical.
Should we help Scully?
I'm not touching this.
There's nowhere to run, Earl!
Well, that was a real mind eff.
- Good-bye.
- Just so you know, Jake has the bracelet in his pocket.
Why would you tell them that?
We're a team!
- You locked me up.
- Yeah, but they didn't know that!
There's no bracelet in his pocket!
What?
There should be.
Where'd it go?
- Shalom, partner.
- Dope.
And you thought Shlomo Ben-Yisrael - wouldn't come through.
- No, I said the name and the costume were offensive, bordering on actionable.
Well, it worked.
Jake brought in Scully's twin just like I planned when I connected them on Facebook, but he had no idea they hated each other.
And when everyone was fighting, they were too distracted to notice old Shlomo.
They all underestimated me, Rosa, but today, they will learn the error of their ways, for today, I will prove that nobody gets the best of Charles Boyle.
I doused your beard in chloroform.
Really?
I find that very hard to beli  - Where's this goin'?
- All the way to Trenton.
Take your time.
Aah, perfect.
What?
What happened?
You know where the bracelet is?
No.
Kevin has arrived with proof that I am the only two-time winner of the heist.
Here's your cummerbund, Raymond.
We don't have time for this, sir!
I'm gonna go search the first floor.
And I will search the second floor.
We are an inseparable team.
That was a devious fib.
I'm betraying her even as we speak.
- Hey, Kev.
- Diaz and I are covertly working together.
She snuck up through the vents.
This is a major reveal.
I feel like you're not appreciating it.
I don't like these heists, or what they bring out in you.
- Oh, clam it, Kevin.
- "Clam it"?
Cheddar, perhaps we should leave.
No, Cheddar stays.
He still has an important role to play.
Give me Mr. Hootsworth.
No one would ever think of looking for the bracelet in Cheddar's favorite chew toy.
Or do you mean Jake's favorite chew toy?
Well, thank God no one was around to hear that.
Ah!
There you are.
I've been looking all over.
Woah.
That's a lot of yolks.
Are you stress eating again or is this just a small Terry snack?
I'm stress eating, Jake!
My snack yolks are in that bowl.
Oh.
Well, stop eating eggs and come help me with the heist!
- I'm not helping you.
- Why not?
Ugh, is this because I once betrayed you?
Yes!
It was our last interaction.
And it was a huge mistake and I now realize that our friendship is way more important than any stupid banner.
Look, the bracelet is in Cheddar's chew toy.
I know because I bugged Holt's cummerbund.
- You did?
- Yes!
I figured he would bring it in to show off.
Now let's do this!
- I don't know.
- Look, Sarge, I'm sorry, okay?
I can't undo the past, but come on.
Would you rather win the heist with me or sit around swallowing eggs like Birdo from "Super Mario 2"?
Birdo doesn't eat eggs.
Birdo spits them!
Oh, my God, you got that reference, Terry?
We're the perfect team!
Come on, Sarge, please?
- Fine, I'll help.
- Ah!
Wonderful.
But, before you fully commit, I should probably give you the heads-up.
My plan is very elaborate and you might get a little messy.
I'm in.
It's the heist, baby!
Now let me know how we get that chew toy.
All right!
Okay.
First, I infiltrate Holt's office and continue our argument about who won last year's heist.
How many cummerbunds are you holding right now?
Zero!
It's one bund to none, son!
- Tell him, Kevin.
- I'm leaving.
It doesn't matter As Holt argues with me I will be covertly releasing more water into Cheddar's bowl.
Then we sit back and wait for -  - Potty time again?
What if he takes him downstairs?
He won't.
I spent a lot of time making clandestine searches on Holt's computer.
Now all of his targeted ads direct him straight to The Puppy PeePee Pad.
Intriguing.
He bought one and put it out on the roof next to Gina's golden statue.
And, because he believes that Cheddar deserves to pee in privacy like any other self-respecting adult, he will leave Cheddar outside alone to do his business.
Notify me when you're done, via bark.
While Holt guards the door, you'll be swapping out Mr. Hootsworth for this.
That all sounds great, but how do I get onto the roof without Holt noticing?
Oh, Sarge.
You'll already be out there In a perfect golden disguise.
The plan worked!
I got it!
Oh my God, you look like an Oscar.
Ooh!
We should take a picture where it looks like I'm holding you.
- Jake.
- You're right.
There's no time.
- We'll do it later.
- No, we won't!
Help me get this paint off!
Okay, put your hands out and I'll squirt you with a little makeup remover.
Hi-ya!
No!
You're betraying me again?
- Why?
- Because of the banner!
But I thought you said our friendship was more important!
Yeah, that was obviously a lie.
The banner was very expensive!
I don't have a lot of money, Sarge.
All right, bye.
Don't make a lot of noise.
Howdy.
I just got back from lunch with Charles, who is not here.
I am real glad I skipped the heist.
Say, who is winning?
I don't know, but I know that I am not winning.
Interesting, it is also not me.
Uh, why are you guys acting so weird?
Gah, weird?
Would a person who is acting weird laugh like this?
A huh-huh huh-ha, carefree!
- Yes.
- Jake!
Oh, Terry, you ripped yourself free.
Yeah, maybe you should try cuffing me to a stronger metal next time.
Yeah, I don't know the relative strength of metals.
What's going on?
Why does Terry look like an Oscar?
- Doesn't he?
- He has the bracelet!
We grabbed Mr. Hootsworth from Cheddar and swapped it for a fake!
Wow, Terry, my betrayals were all in good fun, but this really hurts.
Cheddar, bring me Mr. Hootsworth.
It's an updated model.
The bowtie is Turkish blue instead of Egyptian blue.
How could you not have noticed this?
Because he's a dog.
And at the end of the day a dog is no match for Jake Peralta.
Well yours is a fake, too.
Turkish blue bowtie.
Oh, come on!
The one time I say out loud I'm smarter than a dog?
If I have a fake and you have a fake, who took the real bracelet?
- I did.
- Kevin?
I swapped out Mr. Hootsworth for a fake while you were arguing with Peralta.
How many cummerbunds are you holding right now?
Zero!
It's one bund to none, son!
You betrayed me?
But why?
I can't have more of these trophies in our home.
The cummerbund was already in the living room.
What's next, a rusty medical bracelet suspended above our bed?
Yes!
Now hand it over.
I don't have it.
I gave it to Amy.
-  - Santiago.
- You betrayed me as well?
- You betrayed me first.
You were working with Rosa this whole time.
That wasn't real.
I was always gonna stab her in the back.
You were?
What kind of person treats another human being like that?
You tricked me, Rosa!
And then you shipped me to New Jersey!
First of all, grow up.
Second of all, how'd you - get back here so fast?
- If you get a box wet enough, it's very easy to bust out of it.
No one ask any follow-ups!
I knew I couldn't trust you, Rosa.
That's why I was going to double-cross you with Bill.
That's right, he didn't really die.
Hey, guys, you really thought I'd miss this year's heist?
No way, I'm part of the squad.
- No.
- Not true.
Okay, this is official getting hard to track.
Who has the bracelet now?
- Santiago.
- Yeah!
And no of you are getting it!
We'll see about that.
-  -  What the hell?
Remember that very fancy Swiss pen I got you for Christmas, the one that you keep in your pocket at all times?
It's a taser, bro.
-  - Uuugh!
I'll take that.
Amy, do not make me tase you again.
No, no, no, no, don't!
I'm pregnant!
- What?
- I just found out.
- It's a girl.
- Oh, my God!
Oh my God, it's happening!
Quick, someone get a reaction video of me becoming an uncle!
She's making it up.
The pregnancy scam was my idea.
No.
No, no, no, no, Amy.
Wait, is that true?
Did you just lie to me about our baby?
Yeah, did you lie to us about our baby?
- You tased me!
- You tased me first!
Enough!
Terry's had enough of this.
This was supposed to be just a fun game but it's turned you all into terrible people.
Betraying your husband, putting your friend in the mail.
Jake and Amy, did you guys buy each other any gifts this year that weren't tasers?
- No.
- No.
You all pretended that this was all about helping me with my test.
But none of you cared one bit!
You know what?
You all suck!
-  - Oh no, my voice command.
Terry, look out!
Okay.
I know that was bad, but let's not jump to any conclusions about whose fault it was.
Jacob Peralta, Jacob Peralta This was all his clever plan -  Jacob Peralta - Wow, -  Jacob Peralta - what a fun improvised song.
This was all his clever plan His eyes aren't focusing and he hasn't referred to himself in the third person in minutes.
He's clearly concussed.
Guys, this is bad.
The Lieutenant's exam is in 30 minutes.
Okay, look, let's just get him to One Police Plaza and hopefully he'll wake up on the way.
Charles, help me pick him up.
Copy that.
He's too heavy.
We can't do this.
God!
How does he lift weights and also lift his arms?
This is impossible.
We'll never get him there.
So you guys need help moving a body?
Thank God old Bill's part of the squad.
I mean, assuming, I am part of the squad.
- Yes, sure.
- Totally.
Oh, yes, finally.
I have somewhere to live.
- What?
- Meet me in the alley next to my shopping cart.
It's the one with all the cans.
Seems like his plan is just to put Terry in the shopping cart.
Correct.
We'll take it!
Room 410 is this way!
Okay, we got him here with one minute to spare.
Yes!
I knew we could make it.
All right, Sarge.
You ready to go in there and ace this thing?
Yeah, I can't believe it, I'm gonna be a pilot!
Okay, well, that's not great.
There's no way he can take the test in that condition!
You're right.
Amy, you're going to have to crawl inside his shirt and operate his arms for him.
It's a Ratatouille situation.
- On it.
- No.
It's over.
We have to go in there and tell them that he won't be making it.
So that's it then.
Rosa, you should probably go in first since - this is mostly your fault.
- Dude.
All right, fine, I'll do it, jeez.
Wait.
Where is everyone?
Where are all the desks?
What is happening?
What's happening is - You all suck!
-   You all are losers, you all are losers And Terry Jeffords is the best!
You are all losers, you are all losers And Terry Jeffords is the best Son of a bitch stole my song.
Wait, Terry has the bracelet?
That's right.
Me and my teammate Terry won.
We fooled you all.
- You didn't do !
- Okay, well, neither did Jordan's teammates, but they still got rings.
All right, fine.
Just tell us how you did it.
Well, first, for my plan to work, it had to happen on a day when I could control everything.
I couldn't let it be Halloween.
You faked the gas explosion!
Yeah, stupid actors almost blew it.
What was with that moaning, Trent?
I thought you studied at the Lee Strasberg Institute!
It doesn't mean anything.
They just take your money!
Oh, that is a huge relief.
I felt so bad about poking that guy's wound to make sure it was real.
You should still feel bad about that.
No, it was all fake.
I'm totally absolved.
Continue with your story, Sarge.
I knew you'd suggest a heist as a distraction from my Lieutenant exam, then all I had to do was sit back and watch as everyone took things way too far.
But how'd you know we'd get so out of hand?
I spent the last six months sowing the seeds of conflict.
Man, I am so sick of Jake saying he is the only two-time Halloween heist winner.
I'm the only two-time Halloween heist winner.
I can't believe everyone says you're not helpful during the Halloween heist.
Just because they all think your fingers are too big.
We'll show them.
Thanks for inviting me over for dinner.
Boy, that's hung in a real prominent place, isn't it?
Not for long.
I was manipulated?
- Sorry, Kevin.
- Don't apologize to him, Terry.
It's his first heist.
He needs to learn.
Keep going.
Well, after I got everyone acting like maniacs, all I had to do was make you feel bad by "knocking myself out".
The banner.
But how did you learn my voice command?
- I didn't have to.
- I sold you the damn thing!
No.
I want it to unfurl when I say, "You all suck".
Absolutely.
Pleasure doing business with you.
The pleasure was all mine.
That's gonna work.
I spent $1,800 on that thing!
- You did?
- Amy, stop interrupting.
Terry's doing his big speech.
Anyway, once my fake concussion was on display, I created the perfect distraction for my partner to do his job.
Cheddar, you duplicitous bitch.
I've been training Cheddar for months.
Wow, what a fun improvised song!
When I swapped the Hootsworths, I put a magnetic collar on him!
From there, Cheddar followed us all the way to One Police Plaza, where he hand-delivered the bracelet to me right outside this room.
But, wait, what about the Lieutenant's exam?
Aren't you supposed to be taking it right now?
Hell no, I took that thing weeks ago.
And I passed!
I'm already a lieutenant!
- You are?
- That's incredible!
- Lieutenant Jeffords!
- This is amazing.
I'm so proud of you, Terry.
All right.
You've overstepped now, Bill.
Yeah, it's weird you're here, Bill.
To Terry Jeffords, the ultimate human being slash genius.
Nice work Lieutenant.
-  Yeah!
- Thanks, squad!
Also the next heist will be at Halloween, so you'll only be champion for six months.
- This is half a win at best.
- Sounds about right, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Pretty garbage.
Hey, Scully, so you and Earl made up?
Yup.
Hitchcock helped us realize we shouldn't fight just because we're so different.
- Yeah.
To our differences!
-   Oh, dang it!
Ooh, double dang it.
- What?
- Oh, my God.
Terry, what you did today was awesome and I just wanted to say I'm sorry if I took things too far.
Are you kidding me?
I was just guilting you as a tactic.
I love how crazy the heist gets.
Okay, good, 'cause what I really wanted to say is next heist I'm gonna drown you in your own blood.
Oh, yeah?
Well, then I'm gonna rip your arms off - and beat you to death with 'em.
- Oh!
I'm going to slice your Achilles' tendons, peel off your fingernails, and stick knitting needles in your eyes.
Oh, damn.
Raymond, you were right.
These heists are fun.
Fremulon.
Not a doctor.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
1 Guys!
I have a great idea for a prank.
Before Holt comes in, I'm gonna put ink on the podium where he puts his hands.
I don't think he'll fall for that.
- I did!
- How?
I haven't even opened this yet.
I guess it's unrelated.
Captain Holt hates pranks.
This is gonna backfire, man.
Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down.
I'll move his podium a foot to the left.
What?
He'll be so angry.
- Okay, five inches.
- Five?
- Three?
- Three?
- One?
- One?
All right.
I'll move it a half inch.
Fine.
It's your funeral.
Oh my god.
Worst prank ever.
So stupid.
Holt's not even going to notice.
Good morning.
You guys the podium, it's Ha.
You're crazy!
How did you pull this off?
Yes, Kevin, they moved it a full half inch.
I'll tell you the entire story tonight.
I love you as well.
Goodbye.
Oh, that was a fun several moments.
So, there's been a series of homicides.
Three victims, all young men, each murdered in their own fashion.
A serial killer?
How'd they do it?
Strangled?
Mangled?
Hung, i.e. dangled?
Their bodies were disfigured.
I.e. "mangled".
Continue.
Our killer cut the victims open and ripped out their hearts.
Now, before I assign this case - Five dollars!
- What?
I'm bidding for it.
I want this so badly.
- That's not how we - $20.
Just to make this interesting.
- $100 for Jake to have it!
- I was going to assign the case to you and Peralta but perhaps I should - give it to Diaz instead.
- $200!
It's not about the money, Boyle!
Commissioner Kelly is breathing down my neck.
I need this case handled professionally and maturely.
Name one time I haven't acted professionally.
You're holding a juice box.
It stops me from spilling my juice!
Look, we can handle this, sir.
Do we joke around sometimes?
Yes, but when it's time to buckle down, we're seasoned professionals.
That's why they call us the Spice Boys.
They don't and they won't.
Sir, I swear, give us a chance.
We can get this guy.
Fine.
Case goes to the Spice Boys.
- Please don't call us that.
- Too late.
Spice Boy train has left the station.
Toot toot!
Hey, hey, check it out.
It's my lieutenant start paperwork!
It's gonna be so weird not calling you Sarge anymore.
Maybe I'll go by Loot.
"Morning, Loot"!
"Loot over here".
"Let's invite Loot"!
What do you think?
I bet you're excited about the raise that comes with your promotion.
Well, Terry doesn't like to talk about money, but, uh Cha-ching!
Now I can pay for Showtime.
Find out who or what "SMILF" is!
You know, some people say, "Mo money, mo problems," but those people are idiots.
Money's amazing.
Wait, what?
This says there's not enough money in the Nine-Nine's budget for my raise!
What does that mean?
They're going to transfer me!
Now, I know what you're thinking.
Where'd Dem guts go?
Uh, yeah.
This guy needs a dentist, because he's got a big ol' cavity.
I love that.
I'm stealing it.
You cannot steal what is a gift.
Thank you.
Okay, so whoever did this, they weren't careful with the organs.
They just sorta grabbed whatever and yanked.
Title of your sex tape.
Oh, that's just something we say back at the Nine-Nine.
Interesting, 'cause around here sex tape is what we call the adhesive you use to reattach a severed penis.
Oh, I'll have to pick some of that up.
- Why?
- Anyway most of the killer's incisions are very sloppy but then once he gets to the heart they become very careful.
I mean, look at the vena cava.
That's a clean cut.
Game recognize game.
Hmm.
I like your style, Doctor Cox.
Gentlemen!
The Commissioner would like a status update on the case.
Oh, come on Ray.
You make it sound like I'm puttin' the screws to ya.
No, I just popped in to say if you don't solve these murders immediately there's gonna be some serious consequences.
I'm just messin' with ya!
Listen, you know what would help you catch this guy?
I just launched a new app, HotClues.
Are you familiar with it?
The one that allows civilians to submit anonymous tips directly to the NYPD?
Yes, I'm familiar with HotClues.
Great!
You know, it's actually helped us solve 17 cases, so I think we should ask for the public's help with this one.
No, study after study has shown that soliciting anonymous tips results in false leads and wrongful convictions.
Hmm.
Tell me how you really feel.
- I did.
- And I loved it!
Such passion!
But I think HotClues could help us here.
No, we will solve this case the proper way with actual police work conducted by the two best - detectives in the NYPD.
- Captain!
Well, I certainly hope your methods work.
For the sake of your careers.
Bye now.
Oof!
Now that guy's gonna need some sex tape.
'Cause someone's gonna cut his penis off.
We are vibing!
So I found out where they're transferring me.
And, you know, I'm feeling pretty good about it.
Oh!
Somewhere nice?
Upper West Side?
No, even better.
Staten Island!
Good one, Loot.
- Where you really going?
- No, I'm serious.
Staten!
Wait, they're transferring you out of New York?
It's part of the City!
- Is it, though?
- Hey, Staten Island is great.
It's got parks, loads of bike paths, tons of up and coming restaurants I mean easy access to New Jersey!
You're lying.
Your right pec is popping all over the place.
We all know that's your tell.
Of course I'm lying!
It's Staten Island!
The precinct is the One-Two-Two.
How the hell am I supposed to chant One-Two-Two?
One-Two-Two!
One-Two-Two!
I sound like a damn choo-choo train!
Detectives, how's the case?
Any breakthroughs?
Uh, well, we're still in the early stages.
Do you have a suspect or DNA evidence?
Oh my god.
I wish.
Look, we need to solve this to prove to that idiot John Kelly, how inane and useless his little app is.
Oh dip.
I see what's going on.
- Holt is feeling petty.
- I'm not being petty.
I can assure you my feelings about John Kelly are purely professional.
Are they?
Because every time his name is brought up in our group text thread you immediately send back a super catty GIF of some lady from "The Durrells in Corfu" rolling her eyes.
That's Louisa Durrell, exasperated by the pace of life on Corfu!
Wait, the group text thread is back?
- No.
- We misspoke.
- Yeah.
- Look, if you can't solve this case, I'll reassign it to someone who can.
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
I have an idea.
We need to get into the mind of a sicko.
And the only way to do that is with the help of another sicko.
Jake!
It's so good to see you!
Come give me a hug, I'm not going to eat you!
Also, don't hug me 'cause I will try to eat you.
This is such a surprise!
I haven't seen you since I transferred here!
- How's Amy?
- She's great!
We're married and she's a Sergeant now.
- Wow!
- Yeah!
How's everything here?
You know, same old same old.
- Guess who's here?
Herman.
- Herman!
Always playing Yahtzee, knew everybody's name.
- Worshipped Satan.
- Did he?
He never mentioned that.
- He wouldn't shut up about it.
- It is exhausting.
Well, I'm Charles.
I'm Jake's best friend.
Charles, he's serving three life sentences.
No need to flex.
So Caleb, we're tracking a serial killer and I was thinking you could help us get inside his head.
Just because I ate humans doesn't mean that I'm inhuman, Jake.
Caleb, come on.
That's not what I meant.
I'm just kidding.
I'm probably friends with the guy online.
What's his deal?
Well, he's been murdering young men and cutting out their hearts.
Ew.
What?
I would never eat a heart.
I stick to the normal stuff.
Butts and thighs.
One time I ate a foot, but it was nasty.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You know what?
There was some weird guy on the forum recently.
- The forum?
- Yeah, it's a chat room for people who like to talk about eating human beings but definitely won't act on it.
Wink.
Yeah, it's hosted on -  Reddit.
- Obviously.
Anyways, he showed up from out of nowhere asking questions - about cutting out hearts.
- Really?
Do you know anything else about him?
I'd never seen him on there before but you could check the logs.
I'll approve you.
- I'm an admin.
- Ah.
Oh, you might want to switch to incognito mode.
Otherwise your targeted ads will be pretty cannibal-specific.
Ah, good to know.
Well, it was good to see you, Caleb.
Send me that info.
Hey Terry, you okay?
You skipped all your lunches.
I'm going through the budget to see if there's any way we could save enough money for me to stay here.
- You find anything yet?
- Yeah, we could switch to generic printer ink, cut down on custodial services, and stop buying office birthday cakes.
- Over my dead body!
- It's just an idea.
- Well, take it off the table!
- Damn, Scully, fine.
We could stop paying for an exterminator.
It's pointless.
We all have guns.
Who am I kidding?
We'll never save enough to keep me at the Nine-Nine.
You're right.
The only way to free up that money is if you fire someone.
What?
I can't just fire someone without cause.
Come on.
We all know there's a bunch of dead weight around here.
Sloppy paperwork, penmanship fails, phone etiquette that makes me want to barf.
Let's axe a dud!
Damn, Amy.
I am loving this shade on you.
But Loot's right.
We can't just fire somebody.
That said, you could "inspire" somebody to quit.
For example, Broadway Brian.
Yes!
Broadway Brian, of course!
Who the hell is Broadway Brian?
Brian in records.
He's always talking about what a great singer he is and how his dream is to be in musicals.
You just need to convince him to go for his dream.
Oh, I don't know.
That feels underhanded.
It's never underhanded to help somebody follow their dream.
Yesterday, I was watching "Ellen," and she had this woman on who wanted to be a chef, but she didn't have any taste buds, so she quit her job, hired her best friend to be her taste tester.
And now they have the best taco truck in Lansing.
It was inspiration as .
Yeah.
I'd just be helping him follow his dream!
I'd be doing him a favor!
I'm going to inspire Brian's ass right out of this office!
For him, not me.
Dreams, and whatnot, you know.
Detectives, Commissioner Kelly is back and he found his way here on his own without any tips from the public.
- How impressive is that?
- Well, thank you, Raymond.
I just happened to be in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd check on your progress.
-  - Um, we have a solid lead.
Suspicious online behavior from someone using the name Jamburger77.
There's only one person in the tri-state area with that surname Eileen Jamburger.
101 years old, and immediately racist on the phone.
She is not a suspect at this time.
But the user did make one non-cannibal post.
A negative review of the headroom in a 2006 Saturn Ion.
Real creep car.
So, we pulled records on every 2006 Ion in the city and we're following up on them now.
Well, I'll be.
That's some nice police work, Peralta.
- And Charles.
- I especially like how you found evidence, followed up on it, and it's lead you closer to a solve.
No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.
You must've hated saying that.
No, I didn't.
I like giving compliments.
You have a nice deep voice.
It is very commanding.
Cut the crap, John.
You're furious!
And everyone can tell!
See?
Very commanding.
So, I know Raymond has some issues with HotClues, but we did put the call out on the app and got a very promising tip.
Look, we're not going against our Captain.
So this guy says he saw someone covered in blood getting out of a Saturn Ion.
But you don't need that tip because you are among the best detectives in the NYPD!
You're right, we don't need that tip!
But seriously, send us that tip.
We need it.
Hey, Brian!
What are you up to?
Typing in numbers into a computer.
Like I always do endlessly for 40-60 hours a week.
Well, when you love what you do, you don't work a day in your life!
Unless, do you not love sad data entry?
Well, my passion is performing.
I do musical theater.
- It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!
I am always saying, if you're not singing, - you're not acting.
- Right!
It's probably hard to audition because you're always here, right?
Yes!
I had to pass up a chance to read for "Seussical".
You know Brian, this makes me think of something I saw on "Ellen".
There was this lady, she wanted to be a cook, but her tongue was all messed up, and she had this friend who didn't even have a tongue I mean, she did, and now they own a taco truck in Lansing!
Huh?
Follow your dreams, man!
You gotta follow your dreams.
Find your taco truck!
Wow.
Thank you.
That gives me a lot to think about.
So what did you come down here for?
Oh, uh, I had to borrow the water cooler!
All right.
Thanks, Brian.
Think about what I said.
So, the tipster saw the Saturn parked out back and the woman at the desk said it belongs to the man in room 203.
- One "Larry Bird".
- Obvious fake name.
Or is it so insane that there's no way it's fake?
If you're trying not to draw attention, why not go with something like "John Smith"?
From "Pocahontas"?
Uh, yeah.
Way to fly under the radar.
Excuse me, is there ice yet?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't work here.
I'm a police officer.
Well, then I'd like to lodge a formal complaint.
There hasn't been ice here for days and everyone knows my wine coolers are supposed - to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.
Why are you drinking wine coolers?
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.
Well, I'll mention the ice.
Thanks.
Pig.
Okay.
Oh, it's Holt.
I didn't tell him what we were doing.
I'll act natural.
You're not gonna be on the phone call.
Just do nothing.
Hey, Captain!
What delicious water I'm drinking!
Sorry that we didn't check in before we left.
We're just down at the DMV following up - on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!
Captain!
How'd you know we were here?
I followed you!
John Kelly gave you a "Hot Clue," didn't he?
How dare you disobey me.
Come on, sir, it was a good tip and we're trying to catch a serial killer.
Well then let's see this tip, this groundbreaking tip that threatens to blow the case wide open.
Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.
Naw, bitch.
I'm not being petty.
You just said, "naw, bitch".
- Show me the tip.
-   Title of your sex tape.
I was behind the Royal Motor Inn.
I saw a guy get out of a blue Saturn Ion and he was covered in blood.
Anyway, Baba Booey!
Baba Booey?
Is that a clue?
Uh, I don't know what Baba Booey means, actually.
It's a popular prank phrase from Howard Stern.
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.
Well, that changes everything.
Now we have a credible break in the case.
Baba Booey!
NYPD, open up!
Uh, just a minute!
Ooh, I bet he's frantically packing up his collection of hearts.
Goin' in!
Get back.
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.
I'll go around back.
Fine, Kelly found the murderer's kill room.
Whoop-Dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?
Yeah!
Maybe!
Patrols have searched a five-block radius.
No sign of the perp.
And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.
- Like the inimitable Audrey Hepburn.
- Nope.
Gentlemen, there's something I need to say.
I gave you such a hard time about using Commissioner Kelly's app because I was being petty.
I wanted him to fail and I took it out on you and for that I am very Oh.
You kind of trailed off there, sir.
Were you going to finish your sentence?
It felt like you were going to say you were sorry.
I did.
Boyle heard it.
Uh, I would remember if someone said my catch phrase.
Fine, I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Apology accepted.
- I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.
You're right.
I'll rub it in later.
What matters now is solving this case.
Now, our murderer may have gotten away, but we did find his kill room.
Maybe there's something in here that we're not seeing, yet.
Perhaps we should pay your cannibal friend another visit.
I wouldn't say they're friends so much as ex-cellmates.
No, it's true.
We're friends.
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.
Now, I'll tell you one thing.
You are not looking for a cannibal.
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?
No self-respecting cannibal would waste all that sauce.
See, Charles?
He's a foodie, like you.
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?
Oh man, those are some nice tools.
I would love to spread some ribs using that sternum retractor, but they only sell those to hospitals.
Wait a minute.
What did you just say?
I said I'd love to get my little fingies in some chesties.
No, no, no.
Not the super gross part.
Surgery-grade tools, precise incisions around the heart, and there was no ice at the motel.
Because the perp was using it for the hearts.
We're not looking for a serial killer.
He stole the hearts for a transplant!
Boom!
We solved it.
- Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!
-  - No!
Hey, I did it!
I talked to Brian and encouraged him to pursue his dreams.
Really?
Is he gonna quit?
I don't know, that was the first step.
But I figure if I talk to him twice a day - for the next few weeks - Attention, everyone!
Today will be my final day at the Nine-Nine.
Damn, Loot.
That was fast.
I will be taking my talents to Broadway and I owe it all to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.
All I did was believe in you.
And it changed everything.
So Lieutenant, this one's for you.
Oh.
Another opening Another show - Uh oh.
- From Philly, Boston To Baltimore Amy, you said he could sing.
I didn't say he could sing.
He said he could sing.
Dance break!
What have I done?
- Bye, Jake!
- Here it is.
The federal heart transplant waiting list.
Check out who's all the way down at 2,319.
Angelo Rinaldi, who runs the Rinaldi crime family.
Well.
Then let's pay him a visit.
- NYPD!
- Hands where we can see them!
There's a heart in the cooler.
Sorry, Rinaldi, the only transplant happening today is your ass to jail.
He is definitely unconscious and didn't hear any of that.
But I'm still pumped.
Case closed.
Let's go!
So Rinaldi had his trigger-man stealing hearts so he could have a transplant.
That is fun!
Good job, Ray.
Thank you, Commissioner Kelly.
We couldn't have done it without your Sir, you're doing the trailing off thing again.
Help.
Um and I owe you an apology.
I'm sorry and I must admit, you've really got something on your hands with this HotClues app.
Well, that is so nice of you to say.
But, if you like the app now, wait until you see the updates we're rolling out.
Now you can Auto-Tune your tips.
Show 'em, Micah.
There's a mysterious package On the corner of Fourth and Park - 4th and Park - Huh?
Sounds  Pretty nifty.
No You a Stern fan, Micah?
Oh yeah.
Listen every day.
Baba Booey!
- Baba Booey?
- Baba Booey.
Baba Booey.
You're the guy from the video.
You called in the tip.
Yeah.
Ah, Micah, do me a favor.
Give us a moment here, all right?
Nobody in or out.
Lock the doors.
Thanks, bud.
Actually Micah, you wanna leave that door unlocked in case we want to make a quick getaway?
I'm gonna do what he told me to do.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Thanks, bud.
What's going on, Kelly?
Why is your assistant submitting tips?
Because they already had the information.
The tips aren't coming from the public at all.
Oh, cool theory.
But if I already had the information, why am I pouring so much money into developing this app?
To hide where you're getting it.
Because you're using illegal wiretaps or something!
You got me!
You guys are good!
I just love how you ping pong off each other.
This is blatantly unconstitutional.
- I'm going to the press!
- Yes, you should.
But first, do you know what a stingray is?
Of course we know what a Stingray is.
Tenderest meat in the ocean!
No, stingray is a portable cell tower.
You drive it around the city.
It captures data from any cell phone within reach.
Like, oh, text messages, location history, voicemail Oh my god.
You have a "Dark Knight" machine!
Yes, I do, and the three of you are not going to say a word about it because the 18 felons we captured through the system, they'd go free.
That's unfortunate, but it's better than living in a police state.
- I'm not sitting on this.
- Okay.
But I can assure you, you can't prove this program exists.
It's just your word against mine.
- I'm more than fine with that.
- You shouldn't be.
Because I can prove you'd do anything to sabotage me.
My stingray captured your texts, too.
No, he has the "Durrells in Corfu" GIF!
Oh-ho-ho.
Way worse.
You wrote several people, "I would do anything to rid the NYPD of John Kelly.
"Sincerely, Raymond Holt".
You have got to stop signing your text messages!
What do I do?
Brian sounds terrible.
I can't let him quit his job!
He'll never get cast in anything.
Maybe he'll be one of those people on "The Voice" that's so bad they become an Internet sensation.
That's not what they do on "The Voice", Amy, that's "American Idol"!
"The Voice" is purely a celebration of talent.
If he wants to pursue his dream and it doesn't work out, that's not on you.
He made his choice.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You know, no blood on my hands.
I just need to let him do his thing.
- Terry - Hey, Brian!
So, what did you think of my song?
- I loved how loud it was.
- Thank you.
I wouldn't have had the courage to do it without you.
Sure, I daydream about it all the time, but being a single dad, I always chickened out.
You have a kid?
I have kids.
Three under three.
Oh, fun!
Hey, unrelated.
Uh, what's your financial situation like?
Do you have savings to fall back on?
Do you come from wealth, or?
-  - No, no, but  That's not gonna stop my dreams Sick pipes, Bri.
- Good luck out there.
- Thanks.
No!
I can't let you do this.
What?
You're a bad singer, man.
I don't want to be mean, but if you try to make a living at this, you will die on the street.
Oh.
Thanks for telling me.
- So that's it, then.
- Yup.
Next week is my last week at the Nine-Nine.
Attention, everyone!
I will be giving up singing.
This will be my final performance.
One pound two ounces Not now, Brian!
-  - Sir, there you are.
We've been looking everywhere for.
Kevin says he hasn't heard from you all night.
Yes, I've been sitting in my office wallowing in my hopelessness, and eating the saddest food known to mankind.
Ice cream.
Oh my god, he's Bridget Jones-ing.
Okay, well it's time to put that aside and pull out whatever food you eat when you're happy.
- Dry beans?
- Sure!
Look.
We can still stop John Kelly.
All we need is some hard evidence.
How?
He won't let us anywhere near him or One Police Plaza.
I know, which is why I've assembled a team of powerful allies in the NYPD.
No, that's too risky.
How do you know they're not loyal to John Kelly?
Because these people aren't loyal to anybody.
Ooh-wah-ah-ah-ah I made a suicide squad!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Gentlemen, may I present to you the Suicide Squad.
Hang on there, genius.
You want us, your enemies, to help you bring down Commissioner Kelly?
You guys consider me your enemy?
You're some of my best friends.
We haven't talked to you in, like, three years, C.J. Wait, yeah.
I'm thinking of different guys.
Oh, Raymond, that you came to me to ask for help shows how much you've matured.
You know what else shows how much you've matured?
Your withered face.
Now I know why you refer to this as a Suicide Squad, Peralta, because I already want to kill myself.
Why don't you wait a week?
You'll probably die of old age.
The only way I'm going to die is if you touch me with one of your bony fingers and drag me across the River Styx, you reaper.
Ah, wonderful.
Very creative.
Look, John Kelly has to be stopped.
He's spying on civilians.
It's unconstitutional and it's wrong.
Please.
Do you think any one of these jackals cares about what's right or wrong?
- I'll help.
- See, sir?
There is good in every person.
But I want it to be known it's for selfish reasons.
Why would you want that to be known?
'Cause I've never met C.J. before and I want him to think that I'm cool.
It's working.
I mean, I love how you're taking over the room.
Like that?
Yeah, it's awesome.
You know, I actually wouldn't mind getting rid of John Kelly either.
That guy makes up so many dumb rules.
He told me I couldn't eat raw chicken.
And you think a new commissioner will Yeah, he's already on board, so yes, a new commissioner would let you eat raw chicken for whatever reason.
- It's healthier.
- It sure is, Ceej.
And what do you hope to get out of this, Madeline?
Let me guess Revenge on Dorothy for killing your sister?
I want the same as you, Raymond I think what John Kelly is doing is terrible.
Yes, well said, Wuntch.
So, we're all on board.
This is exciting!
Let's bring it in, huh?
"Suicide Squad" on three.
Ready?
One, two I don't touch other dudes' hands.
- Whose hand is sticky?
- It might be me.
- I ate a popsicle earlier.
- It's probably Madeline.
Cockroaches release a mucus-like secretion.
You would know about roaches, you roach.
And three!
Suicide Squad!
Sorry.
Sorry I'm late.
Why is Santiago here?
We agreed to keep this secret.
Well, it's hard to keep secrets when you're married to an ace detective.
He told me as soon as he got home.
I did.
I'm so excited about the Suicide Squad.
Oh, I love seeing these glimpses of domestic Peraltiago.
- Now kiss.
- No.
- You don't do it enough.
- We do it all the time, - just not in front of you.
- It's been a year!
We don't have time for this.
Now, Kelly's stingrays can steal cell phone data from anyone, including us, so I procured special equipment for us to communicate with.
Extremely old beepers?
Yeah, they're analog, so the stingrays can't detect them.
I had one of these in high school, and it was so cool.
You're just sitting in math class, and you feel that buzz, and it's your dad saying he loves you.
The rest of the day, you're just walking on air.
Did you guys just kiss?
- Hm?
- Did I miss it?
Yes.
It was very unprofessional.
- Oh, come on!
- I don't like this.
I wouldn't wish working with Madeline Wuntch on my worst enemy, and my worst enemy is Madeline Wuntch, whom I hate.
Look, if you wanna stop Kelly, she's the key to my entire plan.
So, either you get over it, or we walk away from this thing right now.
Ugh, fine.
I will learn to trust Madeline Wuntch.
I will never trust Madeline Wuntch.
She's a venomous snake waiting to strike, and you know what we do to snakes.
Chop their heads off.
Remove the skin.
- Turn them into boots.
- Don't be absurd.
Who would want Trollskin boots?
You just said she was a snake.
The devil comes in many forms.
No, what I meant was I want you to follow her and make sure she doesn't betray us.
And, uh, don't tell Peralta.
Count me in.
I got nothing else going on.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready to transfer to Staten Island?
- Eh, that's not real.
- It was pretty real last week.
That's before I decided to pretend it wasn't.
- I'm in denial.
- Most people who are in denial don't usually say they're in denial.
That's because they're in denial about being in denial.
But I'm not in denial.
I'm in denial.
Is Jeffords' brain okay for this mission?
Yes, sir for this and all future Nine-Nine missions, which I'll definitely be a part of.
But let's go.
So, this apartment will be our base for the duration of the mission.
Thank you to The Vulture for procuring it.
Hey, don't thank me.
Thank my boy, Billy.
He said the place was mine while he's still in prison.
That's not what it sounds like.
His only crime was planning a kickass music festival.
Are you friends with the Fyre Festival guy?
Best friends.
He got a bum rap.
You can learn about it when my documentary comes out.
It points all the blame where it clearly belongs with the island people.
Wow, so many levels of terrible there.
All right, we need to catch Kelly in the act of illegally spying, so here's the plan.
We commit a fake crime so serious that he's forced to deploy the stingray.
- What kind of crime?
- We're gonna kidnap a cop.
But not just any cop it needs to be someone so high-ranking that it sends shockwaves through the system, but not important enough that their absence negatively impacts the NYPD in any way.
Who you guys thinking?
We're clearly all looking at you.
Oh, God.
Am I in charge of the meeting?
Dismissed.
Dismissed.
No.
You're getting kidnapped, C.J. Amy, Charles, and I will be the kidnappers.
Captain Holt is the driver.
Here's how it'll go down.
- Approaching the target.
- All right, let's do this.
Masks on.
Actually, scratch that.
We're not gonna use ski masks.
We'll use cool rubber masks.
Ooh, we should be the ladies of "The First Wives Club".
I call Keaton.
We're not gonna do "First Wives Club" masks.
Just because you can't be Keaton?
- Grow up, Jake!
- No, because they don't exist.
And also, yeah, Keaton is clearly the coolest one and I don't think it's really fair that you just "called her".
Forget it.
We'll wear scary gorilla masks.
- Approaching the target.
- Okay, let's do this.
Masks on.
When C.J. goes to get his morning coffee, we will arrive and grab him.
He will pretend to struggle just enough to attract attention.
Help!
Help!
I'm gonna write this down so I remember my lines.
I can see that you already have the word "milk" written on your hand.
I know where this is going.
Milk!
Milk!
- Don't do that.
- Too risky.
What if you leave DNA evidence at the scene?
Well, luckily, it's a missing person's case, so the lead detective will be The Vulture.
He will arrive and No, no, no, no, no.
Hold on, Peralta.
You forgot to say that I ride in on my motorcycle.
Okay, The Vulture who rode in on his motorcycle Kobe.
Will take charge and eliminate any evidence we left behind.
- There's nothing here.
- Make sure the other people working with you are your worst detectives.
I got just the guys for you.
I mean, they're real duds.
I wouldn't even trust those two to get coffee for me.
Gerard, tell him where we're at.
Brooklyn.
You know, you guys take off, all right?
I got this.
- All right.
- Hey, you.
Come here.
You wanna tell me what you saw?
I'll tell you what I'd like to see.
- Your big - Stop.
I'm the one describing the plan.
What, so there's not gonna be any sex at all?
No.
The point is, without any good leads, Kelly will give the order to use the stingray an order that we will record thanks to our very own Madeline Wuntch.
Not possible.
Kelly won't tell me anything.
- He won't even meet with me.
- Perhaps you can sneak in disguised as an old leather chair.
Will you calm down?
She works at One Police Plaza.
All you have to do is "run into him".
Commissioner Kelly.
Oh, Madeline.
I didn't see you there.
I thought you were an old leather chair.
- He's not gonna say that.
- He might.
You're worse than The Vulture.
Anyways, give him a handshake, a pat on the back I heard your app caught a serial killer.
HotClues strikes again.
- Yes, indeedy.
- And plant the bug.
And that's the plan.
That is exactly how tomorrow's gonna go.
Got it.
So you do or you don't want me to yell "milk"?
- Approaching the target.
- Okay, let's do this.
Masks on.
I thought we were getting rubber masks.
Yeah, I couldn't find any.
It's not Halloween.
These look like they're from "Fifty Shades of Grey".
Yeah, I got them from a sex shop, Amy, and we're lucky to have them.
There were only three left.
At least you're not wearing a gimp mask.
Look, there weren't a lot of options.
It was a very awkward retail interaction.
Can we please just kidnap C.J. now?
Leave me alone!
- Leave me alone!
- What the ?
You'll never get me alive!
Help!
Help!
Somebody call the police!
Here, take her.
Take her instead of me.
No, don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah, it's us.
Now, get in the van.
Oh, okay.
Help!
Hey, could we stop and get a Slushee?
It's just that you guys kinda made me drop it back there.
- What the hell was that, C.J.?
- I'm sorry!
I didn't know it was you.
You were supposed to be in gorilla masks.
Okay, so, let me get this straight.
You thought that we were real kidnappers who showed up at the exact time that we planned a fake kidnapping?
Exactly.
You get it.
He gets it.
Nobody is following us.
I'm headed back to the apartment.
Okay, look, that didn't go great, but we got away, and on the plus side, no more of the plan hinges on C.J. Oh, thank God.
He pulled off your mask, Jake.
What if someone saw you?
That's why we have The Vulture.
- Kobe.
- Ow.
Captain Pembroke, what do you have there?
- Did you find a hair?
- Nice work.
Let's bag it.
Let's get it to the lab.
They have my hair?
I thought you put your two worst guys on this.
These are my worst guys, all right?
They're real dorks.
They both wear glasses.
- One of them's even a woman.
- Ugh.
You said you didn't trust them to get coffee.
Look, if you can't tell what "coffee" is code for by now, then you and I shouldn't be talking about this, Jake.
Oh, my God.
He put his best detectives on the case.
Hey, my two best detectives are Sticky and Boner, and they definitely know how to order "coffee".
Extra cream.
Wink, wink.
Guys, stop fighting.
We did it.
Let's just chill and play some "Madden".
No one's playing "Madden" with you, C.J. You know what, Peralta?
This is all your fault.
A witness saw your face and now there's a police sketch of you being sent around.
Oh, please.
That doesn't even look like me.
The only thing that got right is my little curl, and I can just get rid of that.
- Jake, you can't.
- You're right.
- It's worth the risk to keep it.
- This is bad.
- Our plan is collapsing.
- No, it's not.
John Kelly's gonna authorize the stingray within the hour and everything'll be fine assuming Wuntch gets the bug in place.
- She's still standing there.
- Oh, since we got time, you wanna talk about your good-bye party?
Will you eat a cake, or does it have to be - boneless chicken breast?
- Sure.
70-year-old Terry can eat whatever he wants.
You are talking about my retirement party, right?
20 years from now.
Dude, you know I'm not talking about that.
What do you think is gonna happen at the end of the week?
I don't know, but I do know what's gonna happen right now.
Topic change.
You ever wonder where wind starts?
I have.
Wind is crazy.
- You need to face facts.
- About wind?
I'm trying, but you won't engage.
Why you in denial about wind, Rosa?
Commissioner Kelly.
Something's going on with Wuntch.
I heard your app caught a serial killer.
HotClues strikes again.
Yes, indeedy.
What the hell, Raymond?
You were following me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- I've been here the whole time.
- My mistake.
These two goons were carrying a dirty old mop that looked exactly like you.
- What did you do?
- She's up to something.
I'm sure of it.
Hey, it's Kimble and Gerard.
Those nerds found DNA all over the scene.
Take care of it.
- Now?
- Yes!
You know, I know I just got here, but it feels like everything's falling apart.
No, everything's going great, Rosa.
Hey, cool.
I'm not the only one that's in denial.
It's catching on.
I'm not in denial.
We've had a few hiccups, but all that matters is that Wuntch planted the bug on Kelly.
- No.
I didn't.
- What's that now?
You don't trust me, I don't trust you.
The mission is off.
Here's your bug back.
It's not an actual bug, so don't eat it, you lizard.
Ha!
You didn't specify the subspecies of lizard.
I won that round!
Oh, my God.
Will you give it a rest?
Oh, man.
I can't believe this wild ride's over.
We've changed so much.
You know, when we started out, we were just Charles the jock, Amy the rebel, Captain Silly Pants, Talky-talky Rosa, Terry the stoner, and C.J. the ringleader.
I'm not sure you're nailing these.
Okay, I smoothed things over with Madeline, and she's agreed to rejoin the Suicide Squad.
Oh, goody gumdrops.
But do we even need her?
What does she bring to the table?
- 30 years of police experience.
- I have 33.
I earned a Police Combat Cross.
I have a Medal of Honor.
I own the record for most arrests as a uniformed officer in NYPD history.
You got me there of course, I never spent much time in uniform because I was promoted to detective after one month.
They're not allowed to do that.
It's against the rules.
It's also against the rules to let a pile of worms wear a uniform, and yet here you stand.
Okay, just stop.
Look, sir, I've explained this.
Wuntch is the only one that can get close to Kelly.
- We need her.
- Okay.
- The worm pile stays.
- Great.
That was our last obstacle except for one other thing, I promised her that you would apologize for everything you've ever done to her.
Including the Michelle Obama incident?
Yes, she mentioned that specifically.
I'm very curious what happened there.
Oh, it's nothing.
But fine.
I'm sorry, Madeline, for everything.
- Hey.
- Especially for Pushing you into Michelle Obama from behind and then running away.
- What?
- Sir!
- It was very funny.
- Apology accepted.
There's a Policeman's Ball tonight.
I can plant the bug on Kelly there.
And since you don't trust me, you can be my plus one.
Oh, please.
Everyone knows we're enemies.
- It would raise suspicions.
- Don't worry.
I know just what to tell people.
Madeline and I are now lovers.
So, we can assume Kelly authorized stingray surveillance and we missed it, but if we ratchet up the pressure on him, we might get another chance.
How do we ratchet up pressure more than we already have?
By making him believe that the "kidnappers" are serious, and that C.J. is in real danger.
Ooh, what if we send Kelly a severed finger in a box?
No way!
I need all my fingers.
How else am I gonna do the hang ten sign?
Nobody's cutting off your fingers.
I meant we would get one from the morgue.
From the morgue?
Man, we are always getting into the craziest situations.
If I were leaving this squad, I'd miss these moments, but I'm not, so I won't.
Okay, seriously.
What's going on with him?
- It's a whole thing.
- Is it gonna screw up the plan?
It's more quietly self-destructive.
- Sounds good.
Terry, do you.
- I have an idea.
So when my dad lost his flower shop, my Aunt Bruce Charles, we don't have time for a weird Boyle story right now.
Just tell us your idea.
We make a scary hostage video where it looks like we're gonna kill C.J. Ooh, I love that.
Wait a minute.
Your dad did that to save his flower shop?
Was your aunt the hostage?
What happened?
You said we didn't have time.
I didn't know it was the coolest story ever.
Oh, it is.
Well then, tell the whole thing and spare no detail.
Okay, so you know how Aunt Bruce can lactate on command?
- Of course.
- Guys.
Yeah, sorry.
All right.
So we'll make a hostage video, but I don't think we should do it here.
It's too nice.
Do we know anyone with, like, a real creepy basement?
Yeah, it's just got one exposed light bulb and a couple of spent mattresses.
"Spent"?
Oh, yeah.
- That sounds perfect.
- Oh, wait.
Before we decide Scully, what's your basement like?
Bunch of old Victorian wallpaper that came with the house.
I tried to peel it off, but the wall underneath was covered with - fingernail scratches.
- Ooh.
Hitchcock, can you top it?
Mine has mother's hospital bed.
- Okay, Scully?
- Uh-huh, yeah.
I got this one red door I've never been able to open and I hear screams behind it sometimes.
But it's probably just the wind.
Okay, that's actually too scary.
Hitchcock's it is.
How do we get close enough without attracting attention?
Could dance.
You must know some moves.
You were mentioned by name in the "Monster Mash".
Fine, but on two conditions we stay at least 4 inches apart at all times, and you tuck your tail back into your pants so I don't trip on it.
Deal.
My name is Captain Jason Stentley.
It's Friday night I think.
There's no windows in here.
This morning, I was kidnapped for real - Stop.
- What?
What was wrong with that?
You said you were kidnapped "for real".
Well, I don't want people to think I was fake kidnapped.
You know?
I'm selling it.
Okay, let's just do it again.
Say you were kidnapped and nothing else.
Now he's gonna add "nothing else".
- She's right.
- Okay, fine, one more time.
Take 12.
Just say kidnapped.
Okay.
Kidnapped.
You move well.
Must be all the extra legs, you crab.
Don't you find this exhausting?
Thinking of fresh insults?
Not at all, you coffin cave mold beetle.
I meant our relationship.
Aren't you tired of the rivalry?
We fight and we fight, and nothing changes.
But we're really not so different.
I suppose we were close once.
Remember Brighton Beach?
1,200 kilos of heroin in an abandoned subway tunnel.
How could I forget?
The largest drug bust in NYPD history pulled off by a most unlikely duo.
A woman, and a gay, black detective.
No, I meant a human and a rotted jack-o'-lantern.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You weren't all the way rotted back then.
There's John Kelly.
Twirl me into him, and I'll place the bug.
- Hello, John.
- Right on time, Madeline.
Did Raymond buy it?
Did he think you were bonding?
He was smiling at me like an idiot.
You've betrayed us, you coffin cave mole beetle!
Okay, one more take.
Please stop saying, "Don't forget to like and subscribe".
Sure, but how we gonna get followers on this thing then?
NYPD!
- NYPD!
- What's going on?
What's going on is you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Jason Stentley.
Kobe.
But Kobe never passed.
I can't go to prison.
I couldn't even get through the scary parts of the musical, "Chicago".
Does anyone have a good lawyer?
I got a divorce guy, an alimony guy, a slip and fall guy, a pizza's too hot guy Everybody just relax.
We're not gonna go to prison.
It's all gonna work out in the end.
- Should we play Celebrity?
- Come on, man.
Yeah, come on, Terry.
No one wants to play Celebrity the best game ever made but he does have a point.
Nothing bad is gonna happen to us.
Wrong!
You turds are about to get flushed.
Come on, Peralta.
You're up first.
- Let's go.
- Oh, cool.
So, I'm the first turd to be flushed.
Bye, you guys.
What are you doing?
You were gonna get promoted out of Missing Persons.
Your plan went to hell, tough guy.
Wuntch she came to me with a much better one.
Guess what she's giving me for betraying you?
My dream job captain of the - 69th precinct.
- Bingo.
Look, you're not gonna get away with this.
You were a part of the whole thing.
First of all, Jake, there's no records that you and I teamed up together because you insisted that we only communicate - through a beeper.
- Stupid beepers.
We're right to be addicted to our phones.
Eyewitness saw you.
The DNA's all over the scene.
And I caught you red-handed making a hostage video.
Your  is cooked.
That's not a saying.
It's "goose".
Who cares about a goose?
I'm talking about cooking a penis.
All right, this is pointless.
C.J. will just tell everyone the truth.
No, he won't.
I bought him off.
All I gotta do is play "Madden" with him.
- Come on, C.J. - Hey, you know what?
I just beefed hard, so I'm gonna let you stew in here for a little while.
I am loving it.
Such a loser.
And this is rock bottom.
Oh, Raymond.
This is sad.
He's the one you think of like a son, right?
Or are you closer to Santiago?
Not that it matters.
They're both equally going to prison.
Oh, come on, Madeline.
There's no need to gloat.
Though, it does feel good.
Gloaty, gloat, gloat.
I knew I never should have trusted you.
Yes, obviously not, you dum-dum.
John, you're gonna wanna remember this.
Why don't you snap a photo of him?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah Why don't you get in there with him?
Oh, why the heck not?
My kids just got me a digital picture frame.
All right, everybody say, "Nine-Nine".
- Nine-Nine.
- Mm.
Raymond, I love the scowl, but could you slump your shoulders a bit more?
Remember you're a man who just lost everything.
And done.
- We got it, Peralta.
- Boom!
Are they totally shocked?
Is Kelly like, what just happened?
- What just happened?
- You've been had, John.
You see, when you handed me your own locked phone just now to snap that photo, I cloned it to a secure network server.
When you handed Wuntch your locked phone Yeah, yeah.
I already said that part.
Sorry.
I can't see or hear anything.
I'll just be quiet from now on.
I might chime in with a, "Yeah"!
here and there - to stay in the mix.
- Great.
The only way to get you to trust me is if you thought - I was betraying Holt.
- Yeah!
And now I have access to all your personal correspondence All right!
Including all stingray authorizations.
It's over, Kelly.
You're done.
Okay.
You may have won this round, Madeline, but you're gonna live to regret it.
You are both so gonna live to regret it.
I agree with what was just said.
Hey, Jake?
I'm just gonna hold this down.
Yeah, sounds good.
Thank you.
When did you hatch this plan?
Peralta thought of it when I tried to quit the mission.
Hey, what's Holt's expression right now?
Would you describe it as, proud daddy?
It's hard to tell.
He's still piecing it together.
This could take a while.
Why didn't you just tell me what was actually happening?
I wanted to, sir, but it involved trusting Madeline Wuntch, and I just didn't think you could handle it.
But I'm sorry that I lied to you.
Sir?
Sir?
Oh, no.
Is he mad?
I can't see anything.
Did he storm out?
No, I stormed in to tell you it was a great plan.
Nice work, Peralta.
And there it is the proud daddy.
- - Well, well, well.
Commissioner.
Still not used to hearing that.
Of course, I'm only acting commissioner until they choose someone permanent.
Might well be you.
After all, you brought down John Kelly.
Wonder what he's doing now.
He's got a much higher-paying job in the private sector.
- Yes, the world is horrible.
- Mm.
But then again, sometimes, it surprises you.
This whole time, I thought you were up to something, but really, you just wanted what was right for the NYPD.
I did.
But also, I was up to something.
Could I have everyone's attention?
I know it's my last day, and I've been in denial about it all week.
And I still am.
So, I'm giving this toast for no reason.
Here's to nothing!
You okay there, Ter?
It's just that, if I wasn't in denial, I would be so depressed right now at the thought of leaving all of you.
Yeah, we'd be depressed too if anything was happening, which it isn't.
Right, and I'm not gonna say that no matter what precinct number is on your uniform, you will always be part of the Nine-Nine.
It means so much to me you aren't saying that right now.
And I wanna say I'm not gonna miss you at all, you piece of crap.
Good riddance.
Pretty sure you're misreading the game here, Charles.
Yeah.
I see that now.
- To nothing.
- To nothing!
- Thanks, guys, but this sucks.
- Terry, come on.
We're still gonna see you all the time.
I promise.
You'll come visit me in Staten Island?
Yeah!
Or, you know, you can come to Brooklyn.
There's seven of us, one of you, but we can iron out the details later.
Nobody's going to Staten Island.
Okay, damn, I get it.
I'll come to you.
No, you're staying here at the Nine-Nine.
I just talked to Madeline Wuntch.
She's making a personnel change, which frees up some room in the budget.
- Really?
- What kind of personnel change?
I told her that I'd only spent a month as a patrolman before I made detective.
She said that's against regulations and has decided to rectify the situation.
Rectify it how?
