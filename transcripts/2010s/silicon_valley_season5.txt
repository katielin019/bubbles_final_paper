{START OF EPISODE 1}
1 Alright, let's do an exercise.
You can build anything in the world you want with your compression.
What's it going to be?
Three, two, one, go!
- A new Internet.
- What?
Why?
I am your lead investor; - You will respect me as such.
- I do not respect you because you are fat and poor.
So you're telling me that the perfect application of my algorithm belongs to Gavin Fucking Belson.
We need his patent and his funding.
Eventually this will render - every server obsolete.
- Holy shit.
Welcome to the future, Gavin.
Whoa.
Hold it.
- Oh no!
- Son of a bitch!
I have spoken to our top LPs to start a new firm.
Would you care to jump ship with me?
You are, after all, my best friend.
What?
Gavin just fucked off to go - find himself who knows where.
- What is it?
It's the patent.
He just signed over full ownership to me.
There is a loud man here to see you.
Kendo in the house.
-  - Are you fucking kidding me?
-  - Welcome home, and congratulations on getting your business back.
Thank you, and I should congratulate you on your breakthrough.
I can help you get where you want to go.
I'm pretty sure I know where I want to go and how to get there.
I shall look forward to the fight.
Jesus!
What the hell did he order?
No, no!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Oh my God.
These are our new offices?
Yeah.
Well, this is just the lobby.
We're up there on the second floor, but yup.
These are so nice.
There's a fireplace.
Oh!
I am a sucker for an intuitive kitchen layout.
Follow me, right up here.
Trust me, you're gonna love it.
It's hard to believe your pathological inability - to make a decision finally paid off.
-  -  -  Wow.
Richard, well done.
Dude!
Look at this place, huh?
-  Oh, I love it.
-  So, when do these guys move out?
Oh, no, this isn't our space.
Our sublease is straight through here.
Okay.
I welcome you to Pied Piper's new home.
- Huh?
-  Hoo-hoo-hoo!
It's it's very white.
Yeah, it's minimalist, you know?
Sharp, clean lines.
I was thinking about maybe putting my desk here in this corner.
Jared, you over here, right?
Dinesh, Gilfoyle, maybe up against this wall or over there.
You know, just take a minute, walk around the space, see where the mojo takes you.
I mean, we've got some good feng shui in here.
Really good.
Richard, the plan was to hire 15 coders and some assistants and and other staff.
Where exactly would we put them?
Easy.
Right around here.
Look, guys  the price  is unbelievable.
I'm just happy that we got to it when we did before anyone else.
I I emphatically vote that we move on this now, if we all agree.
I mean, we do agree, right?
I cannot put this delicately, so  Are you fucking kidding me, dude?
You want us to work in here?
This is a fucking black site, Richard!
A black site would actually be better, because at least we'd be protected by the Geneva Convention.
This is fucking with my eyes.
Can I get outta here?
Okay, ha hang on.
Richard, can I talk to you - for one second, please, privately?
-  Sure.
- Ah!
- See?
Plenty of outlets.
Richard what are you doing?
We can easily afford a place with windows and air where you can maintain a connection to time and space.
If if we spend all that money, it's gone.
Okay, don't you remember Jack Barker squandering all our runway for those fancy offices or Russ Hanneman spending nearly every cent we had on fucking swag?
I'm sorry, man, we do not get another chance.
This is it.
There is no point whispering.
We can hear every fucking word you say in this sweatbox.
I can hear you gulping, Richard.
No, you can't.
Richard, it is my firm opinion that if we were to take this space, our new hires wouldn't be coding, they would be having panic attacks.
No, come on.
I'm doing a really good job of hiding it, but I'm having one right now.
I gotta get the fuck outta here.
- Jared, you okay?
- I will not be back.
Wait, guys, hold on.
Jared, I'm gonna get you some water, okay?
Okay, what about this guy, Chris Berger?
He's a very skilled engineer.
He was very funny when we met with him.
I think he'd be great.
He was oddly tall, don't you think?
Yeah, pass.
Alright, what about Blake Kang?
His beard hair looked like head hair.
And his head hair looked like beard hair.
Come on!
It's been a fucking month.
I got us these expensive-ass offices because you wanted them, and now they're just sitting here, empty, because you guys won't agree on anyone.
Look, I'm going to be seeing Laurie Bream at this stupid Innovation Hall of Fame event tonight, and she's gonna ask how hiring is going.
She's 11 months pregnant and highly irritable.
What am I going to tell her?
That we've just been dicking around the whole time?
- We're not dicking around.
- Really?
What about this?
TouchÃ©.
He sent in a professional headshot.
We had no choice.
Plus his face looks like a taint.
Okay, yeah, fair.
But look, I sent you 63 good people.
I spared you kilt guy, openly alt-right guy, obviously closeted alt-right guy, and the guy with the stupid fucking pizza app.
It was so lame, it would somehow make you hate pizza.
- You have to choose.
- Dude, it's easy for you to say.
You're gonna be off CEO'ing, going to fancy galas.
We're the ones who have to like be in the engine room with these clowns.
They have to meet our rigorous standards.
I mean, look at the three we've already hired.
- Just look at them.
- There they are.
Stallions.
Each one more magnificent than the last.
Perfect.
Yeah, they're glorious, obviously, but that's only three of them, and they're luxuriating here in this huge fucking palace that is costing us a fortune, so hurry up and pick these fucking coders, and stop acting like a couple of spoiled millionaires.
Alright, Richard, your tuxedo is pressed and ready for the gala.
I put a touch of mint in the steamer.
You're gonna look like Richard Gere from "Pretty Woman".
Maybe tonight you'll fall for a radiant sex worker.
During my sabbatical from Hooli, I toured the wonders of the world, seeking inspiration from mankind's greatest achievements The Parthenon, Angkor Wat, the Great Pyramid of Giza.
But it wasn't until my flight home that I had my epiphany.
Yes, those wonders are visited by thousands of people every year, but 2.4 million people visit HooliSearch every minute.
God, what a fucking douchebag.
-  -  And then it occurred to me.
What I have built is a far greater achievement, than any of the ancient world.
And the ideal version of myself was the man I already was.
-  -  Thank you.
Richard?
Richard Hendricks.
- Oh.
Huh?
Okay.
Yeah, hi, Duncan.
- Yeah.
Me and my guys were just talking about you and your pizza app.
Oh yeah.
I bet.
Our algorithm finds you the cheapest, fastest pizza, and it's it's awesome.
- Yeah.
Definitely.
- It's actually so awesome That oh man, I'm gonna I'm gonna have to pull my resume.
Oh, you're pulling your  Oh no.
Yeah, I just don't feel as psyched about it - as I do about Sliceline.
- Sliceline?
That's the name of your app?
- Yeah.
- Oh God.
- Great.
- Yeah, it's a pun.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
It rhymes with Priceline.
- Okay.
Just so, it rhymes?
Okay.
- Yeah.
It's a rhyming pun.
Anyway, there might be some major VCs around here, so I gotta go mingle.
Okay.
It's the it's the worst part of this job.
Am I right?
I'm kidding.
It's the best part of the job.
Okay.
What an asshole.
- Richard.
- Gavin, hello.
Don't you look cute in your Sunday best?
How's that little bunny Internet going?
Mmm.
New Internet.
New.
Unlike your old Internet.
You know, I'm glad I ran into you, Richard.
I was actually starting to feel bad about what I did today.
Oh?
And what was that?
Invent the MOSFET transistor?
It's old technology.
It's very old, like you.
No.
I've heard that you're trying to staff up.
Over the past few months, you've met with just about every distributed systems developer in the Valley.
Okay, well, not everyone.
63 of them, and as of 4:30 p.m. this afternoon, I hired them, all 63 of them.
Yeah, I had to pay through the nose, but you know what?
- - That look right there on your face?
It makes it worth every penny.
You know what?
Enjoy the reception, Richard.
You too.
Yeah, he wasn't bluffing.
He hired all of them.
Even my boy Blake Kang?
He was a good one.
I'm sorry, uh, your boy?
I thought his hair was backwards?
You guys were lukewarm on him and everybody else for all kinds of stupid reasons.
Well, now that they're unavailable, their strengths are more readily apparent.
And I don't want to point fingers, but we wouldn't be here if you hadn't let Gilfoyle and me waste so much time being picky.
What?
I was dying to move faster.
I was just respecting your process.
Our process sucks.
Your inability to stop us from sucking is a failure of leadership.
At least we still have the stallions.
Ah.
Those stallions.
Look at 'em.
Magnificent.
Sit back down.
Just sit in your chairs.
Jared, um call alt-right guy and cologne boy and all the other rejects, and set meetings.
Well, I did a little digging on the alt-right guy, and he's pretty involved in a campaign to eliminate black emojis, but there might be another option.
Do you remember Kira Pickford?
Yes, actually.
Yeah, good coder, but she had her own company.
Well, that's true, except that her company, Optimoji, just lost their second round of funding, so they're basically on life support.
So?
So, what if, instead of building a team, we acquired one?
But Optimoji has 30 people.
We only need 12.
Well, we'll just insist that she let the other 18 go.
We have a lot of leverage.
Richard is a shrewd negotiator, and I'm, you know, spirited.
Look, Kira, this is a fair offer.
But I've got 30 great guys.
We're like family, and you only wanna bring along 12?
I have to do what's right by my guys.
Look, I know what it's like to only be able to rescue half your family, - and it's awful, but what can you do?
- Shh, shh.
- Sometimes there's only one - Jared, okay, stop.
Um, look, Kira, you're not gonna find a better deal than that.
Your company is close to bankruptcy and we all know that there are a lotta coders out there in this old town, and we could go to any of 'em, but we wanna go to you, so kinda feels like we've got all the cards here, huh?
Richard.
You keep following me, I'm gonna call the cops.
-  I'm just kidding.
- Oh.
- Hey, I'm Duncan.
- Hey.
Kira.
Hey, guess what company just got his Series "A" Term Sheet?
Huh?
Oh, the Sliceline.
Congrats, yeah.
Yeah, we're staffing up like crazy.
Speaking of staffing, how about all those coders you lost, man?
I'm sorry.
That must've been a real blow.
What coders?
Um, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but this is boring.
Thank God I didn't accept your offer.
I'd be the only guy working for you now that Gavin Belson swooped in and tactically mass-hired every single distributed systems engineer you were looking at.
Gavin hired all of Richard's coders?
Not everyone.
Not everyone.
Yup.
The guy is savage, and so are my guys if they don't get their caffeine, so nice meeting you, Kira.
Cool.
Cool, cool.
What were you saying about holding all the cards?
All of my coders or none of them.
Take it or leave it.
What?
What the fuck?
- Do you have - Do you  Jian-Yang!
Jian-Yang would you please explain why we each found some random Chinese guy asleep in our beds?
Yes, you work all day.
Your rooms are always empty, so they use.
- The fuck they do.
- Yes, it's not your house.
This is not your house either, Jian-Yang.
This is Erlich's house.
Do you think Erlich would want your guys here?
No.
That's why I invite them, because I hate Errich.
We are not Erlich.
You are from Errich's administration.
No, we are not.
Nobody has heard from Erlich in months.
This isn't working.
I'm gonna drag your cousin the fuck outta my lair.
JIAN- No, this is my cousin.
Engineers, welcome.
You are 63 of the top distributed systems developers in the Valley, and we're looking forward to working with you.
Hooli is the future, and your future is the Box Two.
So, are there any questions?
Yes?
I'm sorry, but what if we don't wanna work on that?
Weird.
This is our flagship product, but I'm sure we'd all like to hear what you would like to work on.
A decentralized Internet, like we were going to build with Richard Hendricks.
Actually, that's the one thing we can't do here at Hooli.
Yes?
Sorry.
You only hired us because Pied Piper wanted us, right?
Untrue.
Go on.
And Pied Piper only wanted us because of our ability to help build a decentralized Internet.
Can't speak to that.
Continue.
And you're telling us that even if we want to, we can't build a decentralized Internet here.
May I ask why not?
Because Richard owns the patent for it.
Yes, third row, red hoodie.
- How did he get it?
- I gave it to him.
- You in the back?
- Why did you do that?
It was a Buddhist act of selflessness.
Well, I'm also a Buddhist, and I would never give him the patent.
I mean, once he builds that Internet, he's gonna render Hooli's entire web-based ecosystem completely obsolete.
I mean, everything you're doing here is antiquated.
That's not a question.
That's a statement.
You know what?
Fuck you guys.
I don't want you working on my box.
It's too good for you.
"Antiquated"?
Why did you all take my money then, you entitled little pricks?
You all think you're John Lennon until someone waves a dollar in your face!
You know what?
Get outta here!
Go on, just wander the campus for four years until you vest.
See what I care.
I'm serious!
Go!
Goodbye!
Thank you very much!
Assholes.
"Antiquated"?
Fuck do they think they are?
I'm in the Innovation Hall of Fame.
Are they?
Speaking of, they sent over the official inductees portrait.
You and your peers.
Handsome bunch.
Fuck.
Fuck!
- So, Mr. Yang - It's Mr. Jian.
In China, last name comes first.
Okay.
Mr. Jian, you say that Erlich Bachman wrote this letter - to you?
- Yes.
"This is Erlich.
Hello.
"I am gone, but Jian-Yang is a very good friend and very smart.
"I want him to be the leader of the house "and control all of the friends.
Goodbye.
Bachman Erlich".
Yes.
I want his house.
Thank you.
Okay, I don't technically represent Mr. Bachman.
I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel, so my exposure to Bachman pertains only to his 10% ownership of the business.
Errich owns 10% of Pied Piper?
This was not a lie?
Sadly, no, that's very, very real.
That's worth a lot of money.
It's promising tech.
One day it could be worth a shit-ton.
Shit-ton.
Yes.
Mr. Jian, you seem like a good guy.
Um, this letter is not a legal document.
I mean, maybe a skilled attorney could make a case that in the absence of an existing will, this would serve as one in the case of Bachman's death, but as far as I can tell, the guy is not Dead.
Yes.
Errich is dead.
Do you happen to have a death certificate - or any any form of proof of - Yes.
I can get it now.
Our deal with Kira is for 30 fucking coders.
Where in the hell are we gonna put them?
Well, I suppose we could put three more workstations here, and then two more over there.
It'd be crowded but cozy.
They'll be all holed up together like the Branch Davidians.
Yeah, but, I mean, are we sure this is the right thing to do?
I mean, I don't want to crowd the stallions.
Are we sure taking on all 30 of Kira's guys is the right move?
We can get up and running.
They all know each other, so we won't have to play the name game.
- Yeah.
-  - Ron, hello.
- Hey, buddy.
Hang on just a second.
No, the the exit is The exit is the other way.
God damn it.
Um, Richie, you know a guy named "Jee-Ann"?
Jan?
Uh, no.
Well, I know a "Jan the Man," but she's a woman.
Look, did you did you talk to the Optimoji board yet?
Uh, did we close the deal?
Uh, well, a deal closed.
Another bidder came in with a better offer, - so they went with them.
- RICHARD : What?
Was it Gavin fucking Belson again?
RON : No, it was a new company.
Real smart, clever name.
Sort of a pun that rhymes.
- -  Oh, hello, dickheads.
I hope I'm not interrupting your plotting, -  - you sneaky little dinks.
Kira, you and I had a deal, okay?
So fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you!
-  -  What did he say?
Not you.
Just e everyone.
I meant fuck all of you.
No one specific.
- Richard, you low-balled me.
- Mmm?
Remember?
Well, Duncan here said he wanted to grow fast as balls.
- He said he was psyched.
- Yeah, I am psyched.
I'd hire a million people if I could.
See, if I have to sell my company, I might as well sell it to the CEO who actually wants all of us.
It's pizza, Kira.
Richard, we're just three CEOs trying to do right by our companies.
Okay, you know what?
I'm glad you turned us down, because I don't want to work with anyone who wants to work with this meathead.
I'm taking these.
I'm taking all of them.
Maybe just take one.
You have like four employees.
Ha!
Ah, shit.
Throw it away.
Patrice, I'd like to welcome you back to the Hooli family.
It's wonderful to be back, Gavin.
Sadly, the timing couldn't be worse.
Those code-monkeys I just hired were right about one thing: Making Jack's box the flagship product of this company will send us down a path to technological irrelevance from which we will never return.
But in light of the time and resources we've invested in this product, convincing the board and our shareholders to simply scrap it will be nearly impossible.
Our company is too big to turn around that quickly.
Gavin, what if you launched a new product to help us correct course?
Absolutely.
Look at all the products you've brought to market over the years.
Hmm.
True.
I did invent the HooliPod and the HooliPad and the HooliPad Pro, but a man only has so many game-changing inventions in him.
And technically, all the products he just named were money-losers.
I mean, you could argue we'd have been better off if he'd never invented any of that stuff.
- Hoover.
-  Sir.
Patrice, can I talk to you outside for a second?
Anyway, if Jack Barker's insidious box is allowed to go to market, we may all lose our jobs.
We may all go the way of Patrice.
But we must fight it.
We cannot sacrifice our long-term wellbeing in the interest of paltry, short-term profits.
Well, they're not paltry, exactly.
Did you not see the preorder figures for the Box Two?
They came in this morning.
Holy shit.
Are these right?
How many quarters is this?
Just one.
The Box Two will be by far the most lucrative new product we've ever released.
Fucking Sliceline.
Plus his fancy, hi-tech pizza tastes just like Domino's.
There's a reason for that.
Check out the liner.
Oh yeah.
I guess that's Domino's.
We never had pizza 'cause my step-mom said Italians aren't real white people.
Hold on.
Duncan doesn't even make his own pizza?
He just orders it from Domino's and switches the boxes?
He really is sneaky.
It's not sneaky.
It's stupid.
Switching boxes costs a lot of money.
Okay.
How do you know?
I need to prove Errich's dead, so I want to ship a dead body from China, but it's hard to find a white body in China, especially fat like Errich, so I buy a fat, white cadaver from Cincinnati medical school.
But to ship to China, then switch box, then ship back, it's way too much money.
Say that again.
Like, not one word of that made sense.
Hold on.
Just ju What uh does anyone does anyone know the price of a Domino's pizza?
A large, 10 bucks.
Okay, well, Sliceline sells theirs for nine.
- So?
-  So, we're not fucked yet.
That was kinda crazy, Richard.
That was  I mean, you threw a full-on tantrum.
I know, I know.
I am so sorry.
It's just I guess I'm just a CEO trying to do right by my company.
- Like you guys.
-  Speaking of business, wow, we're having a hell of a night.
Yeah, well, I would know.
About 500 of those orders tonight are me.
Oh.
Richard, you really didn't have to do that.
But the peace offering is super appreciated.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't really call it a peace offering.
You see, Duncan, you took eight mil in funding, right?
And then you matched my offer to acquire Optimoji here from Kira, but the thing is, you can't sell your pizzas for nine bucks a pop without taking a bath, can you?
The reboxing, the double delivery, ugh.
You lose, what, four bucks an order?
Five, actually.
- We're losing five bucks a pizza?
- Yeah.
Only temporarily.
So, her team is gonna optimize our order routing and allocation, and then we'll be cash-flow positive.
We can easily turn it around - before we run out of money.
- Right.
- Yeah.
- Unless a lot of people buy your pizza very quickly.
What are What are you doing?
Well, Duncan, I can be a dickhead too.
You see, I have $13 million in my bank account and a very low payroll, which affords me to buy a lot of tasty 'za before you can turn it around.
You're trying to bankrupt us?
No, Kira.
I'm simply trying to devalue your company, so that I can make a low-ball acquisition offer which you cannot refuse.
Richard, I'm just gonna delete your account.
You see, my engineers already thought of that, and they worked up a little botnet program.
Thousands of fake users indistinguishable from real ones geolocated perfectly to maximize drive time and bleed your little greasebag operation dry.
You know, I may not have that many coders, but the ones I do are stallions, each one more magnificent than the last.
You spent $19,000 on pizza?
No, $19,000 on vengeance.
You're acquiring Sliceline who already acquired Optimoji?
Richard, you're talking about absorbing a staff of 50.
How are you gonna spin this to Laurie?
Well, you said you'd protect me from Laurie.
I mean, she's your partner.
Are you afraid of her?
Of course I'm afraid of her.
The woman got pregnant just to prove to me that she could do it without missing a day of work.
Okay, fair enough, but maybe this one time you could take my side.
I cannot take your side.
You're asking for 50 employees.
- Think of the - Sorry I am late.
Hey, Laurie.
Did you, uh Induce?
Yes, this morning and here I am.
So, Richard, I received your email.
I understand you wish to acquire a company called Sliceline, which themselves recently acquired a company called Optimoji.
Yes, and I will be firing both companies' CEOs and taking on a total engineering team of about, uh, 50.
Fifty?
Monica, you are okay with this?
Well, it shortens their runway significantly, but you did say that you want them to grow, Laurie.
Yes, but in this case it seems  reckless.
However, if you are on top of it, Monica, then  approved.
Congratulations.
Great.
Thanks.
And congratulations to you too.
On?
On the on your On your baby.
Oh.
This is awesome.
Gavin is essentially doubling-down on the very thing we are destroying.
It's like he's giving up.
Maybe I should've ordered the nicer Tesla.
Ah.
Oh gosh.
Everyone's here.
Richard.
So many people.
Richard.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you'd want to give some opening remarks, you know, it being the first day and all, just to set the tone.
Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Hendricks!
Um  Um  Well, it's great to have everybody and so many f faces.
We've got a lot of men and women here.
And  we should remember that.
So, let's keep it clean.
Um it's always a challenge  to get it I've got I should probably more to say in a minute.
I just have to go, one One second, in my office  and then we'll conclude.
Uh, he just needs a second in his office, then he's gonna come back.
Oh God.
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Um, Richard, I know I know money's tight, but I think I might invest in a modesty panel for your desk.
What?
Yeah The monkey speaks his mind Now, three monkeys sat in a coconut tree Discussing things as they are said to be Said one to other, Now listen, you two There's a certain rumor that can't be true That man descended our noble race Why, the very idea Is a big disgrace And here's another thing You will never see A monkey building a fence Around a coconut tree And let the coconuts Go to waste Forbidding all the monkeys To come and taste
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
1 I sent you 63 good people.
You have to choose.
They have to meet our rigorous standards.
I mean, look at the three we've already hired.
Stallions.
Hooli is the future, and your future is the Box 2.
Are there any questions?
Everything you're doing here is antiquated.
Fuck you guys.
Get outta here.
You wish to acquire a company called Sliceline?
I will be taking on a total engineering team of about 50.
Uh  Don't tell anyone, okay?
Uh  My Tesla finally came.
Was that a wise purchase?
Considering Richard just obliterated Pied Piper's runway hiring all those coders?
I ordered it a month ago.
But still, it's an investment.
As I understand, cars depreciate 10 percent as soon as they fall off the truck.
Like that.
-  - So if the car costs $100, well you just lost $10.
Did it cost $100?
Or more?
It's not about the money.
I, my friend, am now part of the green revolution.
Are you?
Most electricity still comes from gas plants and coal-burning smoke stacks.
Do you know where your electricity comes from?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
Look how shiny it is.
Plus, it has a frunk A front trunk.
Here, hop in, let me give you a ride to work.
-  -  Dinesh, you like this?
Jesus fucking Christ!
- Is that a dead pig?
- Yes.
It's just like Errich.
My corrupt uncle sent a death certificate from China but to send body is too expensive.
So I cremate a pig because a pig is most like a fat human.
I gotta get to work.
Dinesh can you take pig to backyard?
I need to burn it.
No.
That's odd.
You left before me.
How was I able to park before you?
I guess all 50 of the new employees decided to show up bright and early for the fucking all-hands meeting.
I had to park on level five.
Huh!
So unlike you, the world understands that I'm saving the planet and has rewarded me with  primo spot.
Congratulations.
You've finally taken your rightful spot amongst the handicapped.
Is it broken?
Uh, no.
I think I'm okay.
One question, what the fuck happened?
'Cause you were doing your speech right there in front of the whole company, and then Wow.
Well uh, my speech was going poorly.
- Agreed.
- Yeah.
And I started to panic.
With good reason.
And then all of a sudden, I I thought I had to shit my pants, okay?
And that's why you jumped face first into a glass wall?
No, it all happened so fast, but essentially, I thought, if it was gonna happen, I didn't want to be standing.
So, I crouched, because If you wanna shit yourself, you'd rather be crouching than standing?
Yes.
I mean, if you had to.
I hate to say this, but I follow you.
The thing is, when I crouched, I had to burp.
But since I was all, you know, tucked up, I actually vomited a little.
And then, that's when my fight-or-flight reflex kicked in.
Do you ever fight?
Okay, fine, then my "or flight" reflex kicked in and I just - Pow.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Well, what we saw was a very oily man in mid-sentence dip down, vomit, and then thrust himself violently face first into a glass wall.
But I guess it's a lot less embarrassing the way you explain it.
Richard, what about Did you evacuate in your pants?
Oh, no, uh, good news.
I think what happened when I hit the glass, I sort of shocked myself.
Now, I don't have to.
That's actually kind of disappointing, because, like, no closure.
Well, on the bright side, it'll be that much easier to get you cleaned up and back out there.
What?
I have you scheduled for three more days of orientation.
No way.
Cancel them.
There's no way I'm going back out there.
Especially after knowing what they saw.
No, fuck it.
Plus, I'm I'm way too busy, so.
Gentlemen, could we have the room please?
- So we can leave?
- Sweet.
Richard, look out there.
There's Optimoji and Sliceline t-shirts left and right.
These are conquered soldiers still in their old uniforms.
But we need everyone here to be Pied Pipers.
I mean, you're asking them to spend the primes of their lives on your vision.
Right?
And you need to go out there and lead them.
They're they're yearning for inspiration.
I can't do inspiration.
I'm a coder.
Look there, the new Internet.
That's inspiration.
Use that.
Richard, this is all an idea.
And people don't wanna follow an idea, they wanna follow a leader.
Look at the last guy to create a new Internet.
Al Gore.
His ideas were excellent, but he talked like a narcoleptic plantation owner, so he lost the presidency to a fake cowboy and now he makes apocalypse porn.
Look, the point is, you need to lead with passion.
When you set your mind to it, you're one of the most charismatic people I've ever met.
And I have met Ira Glass.
I know it's three days we could be working, but ultimately, a unified team will save us time in the end.
You wanna save time?
If you wanna save time, here's what you do.
You said it yourself, okay, the Optimoji guys and the Sliceline guys are separate, with their own separate histories, their own separate shorthands, so let's use that.
Let's give the scheduler to the Optimoji guys, and the server-less runtime to the Sliceline guys.
Then we have Dinesh and Gilfoyle and the Stallions, they do the integration.
Boom, we're off and running.
How about that?
That way, no one has to shit or burp or puke or get a nosebleed in front of anyone.
As for the bezel design, our young aesthete, Dang, has once again spun gold.
Let's see it.
Wait, my signature's not on it?
How could it be the Gavin Belson Signature Box III without Gavin Belson's signature on it?
Well, the word "signature" has a handwritten feel to it.
Why is my signature not on this?
Gavin, there was a slight issue with your signature.
What issue?
Do you have a mock-up?
Pull it up.
Ah, yes!
There.
What's wrong with that?
Well, reactions to this from our testing groups were mixed, so we contacted a handwriting expert.
And, uh, well Jean, do you have the report?
Absolutely.
Pleasure to be on your team, Gavin.
Here it is.
"The signature displayed troubling traits.
"Left of upright slant, "narrow angles, tense strokes, conclusively indicative of sociopathic tendencies".
- What?
- "Characterized by "a lack of empathy and need to dominate, "a willingness to hurt others to achieve one's goals.
Inability to accept bad news" - Hoover?
-  Sir?
Get this horrible woman the fuck out of my office, now.
What the fuck is that?
It's the cheapest thing I could find that qualified as an electric vehicle.
I found it on Craigslist.
Now you get to park on the fifth floor.
Enjoy the drive.
Oh, and you were right it does feel good to be a part of the green revolution.
Oh, yeah?
Well, does that "vehicle" have "Insane Mode"?
One press of a button and I go zero to 60 in 3.2 What a day.
See, we'd still be finishing up orientation, singing Kumbayas and doing trust falls.
But instead, both our Optimoji and Sliceline teams have gone through their first code review.
Well, to be fair, I never would've scheduled trust falls.
I mean, you do one of those, you're so jacked up on adrenaline, the rest of the day is basically shot.
We were gonna have a noncompetitive talent show with no losers.
Not possible.
Dick, I just got in and checked the commits.
Are you aware that the Sliceline guys have been encoding time in nanoseconds, as we usually do, but the Optimoji guys have been using milliseconds?
What?
Just the fact that we're still calling them Sliceline guys and Optimoji guys is sending up all sorts of red flags.
And I don't even mean the word "guys," which I just learned is a micro-aggression.
It's fine, "guys".
I will get them to re-factor their code.
We're still ahead of where we'd be if we were doing some kind of talent show.
Richard?
Gilfoyle parked his electric pile of trash in my Tesla's spot.
Do you think that's fair?
Not now, Dinesh.
Why can't you guys switch to milliseconds?
Why do we have to change?
Sorry, well, our entire code base uses nanoseconds.
And you didn't think it was important to tell us this?
No, well, I mean, it was It was part of the orientation that was scheduled, which had to be, for numerous reasons, uh, canceled.
And I'm sorry about that, I know it sucks.
If I could make it suck less, I would, but You could get some decent coffee in here.
What?
What's wrong with Philz Coffee?
That's high-end Joe, bro.
At Optimoji, we had Stumptown brought in every day.
So that would inspire you?
Different coffee?
Inspire us?
You know what?
Bup, bup, bup!
Stumptown it is.
You got it.
And you'll tell your guys about the nanoseconds?
Yeah.
Unless you wanna get up in front of everyone and announce it yourself.
No, no, no, I'd rather you That was a joke.
Your speech was a disaster.
Oh.
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
It was really bad.
I know.
Okay, Mr. Jian, you have petitioned this court to become the sole executor of the estate of Erlich Bachman, is that correct?
Yes.
I see you've got all the paperwork, here.
Yes.
Errich Bachman is dead.
Oh!
Um Mr. Jian, there's absolutely no need to display the deceased remains.
You can put that away.
- I have it.
- Yes.
Please put it down.
Errich Bachman is cremated into ashes.
And I put it in bucket.
Put it down, sir.
Now, have you determined to a reasonable degree of certainty that Mr. Bachman has no living next of kin?
No wife, children, parents, no brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, grandparents, children from a predeceased spouse or domestic partnership?
No.
He died alone.
He's a very sad man.
So, I have a a house and a 10% Pied Piper.
In the absence of any next of kin, I will approve you as the sole beneficiary and the official executor of Mr. Bachman's estate.
But, before you can distribute any of his assets into your personal possession, you are required to settle all claims against the estate.
Do you understand?
So I get a house and a 10% Pied Piper?
You need to pay all of his outstanding bills.
How much do I have to pay?
Well, these debts can sometimes be substantial.
Would you characterize Mr. Bachman as a financially responsible man?
Hey, Sliceline guys, what's up?
Heh.
So wanted to talk to you guys about something.
Past couple days, the Optimoji guys have really stepped up their game, but, um, you guys have kind of been flagging.
I'm just wondering if everything's all right.
Yeah.
Great.
Just nice to know where we stand.
- Sorry?
- We get it.
You only acquired Sliceline because you wanted Optimoji.
What?
No, wrong.
Uh, why would you say that?
I didn't.
You did, when you chose their coffee over ours.
It's bad enough we can't have Slice here.
Slice?
The beverage?
No, no.
Slice was our mascot.
He's really smart.
Okay, well Bring the little guy in.
What about the no dog policy?
What no dog policy, huh?
Really?
Are you sure you don't need to check with Optimoji?
I'm pretty sure, but, uh Danny?
Dan man?
Uh, I just was wondering if you're cool if the Sliceline guys - brought in their dog.
- He's really smart.
Well at Optimoji, we had a no dog policy.
Come on.
Don't be such a dork.
Let 'em have it.
It's just a dog.
Sure.
Fine.
You're the CEO.
Yes, I am.
All right.
And from this point on, CEO stands for Canine Endorsement Oh yeah.
All right.
Hey, look at you and your 10-speed.
Aw, you got up early 'cause you thought you could take my space.
That's cute.
Almost as cute as your bike.
Yeah, I guess this is a bike, isn't it?
So I get to use the bike lane.
See you later.
No, bikes still have to follow traffic laws!
That's not fair!
All right.
You wanna get insane?
Let's get insane.
- Whoa!
-   Fuck you, Gilfoyle!
-  -    Something's wrong with your frunk.
It's all frucked up.
Hey, Tesla!
You know where Pied Piper is?
Right here, guys.
What the fuck?
-  -  Dick?
Hey, uh - Explain.
- Okay, uh So, Optimoji had a no dog policy and apparently that's because every single one of 'em have a fucking dog.
And when we waived our no dog policy You waived our no dog policy?
I had Jared put that in there for a reason, Richard!
In Pakistan, dogs are not pets, okay?
They're vicious beasts and they chase you down the street and they bite you.
My cousin Eftahar lost an ear.
Our mayor was very corrupt.
But he put poison pills in chicken meat to take care of the dog problem.
We hailed him as a hero.
We put up statues of him everywhere.
He's gonna be okay.
Who's gonna be okay?
What?
Stallion down?
He's violently allergic to dogs.
It's another reason for our iron-clad no dog policy.
Jared, when were you planning on telling me all of this?
Day two of orientation.
Right after safe space charades.
So look, we'll pay for your entire medical bill, obviously.
So, you're good.
You're covering his deductible?
Then you have to cover ours, right?
And what about the dogs?
They're people, too.
They're literally not.
They're dogs!
Hold strong.
Fuck you!
- Oh.
- So Jared, uh, you wanted me to unite the teams and I have.
They are united against me.
Even the dogs, apparently.
I wish they had your fecal fortitude.
Hey, do me a favor and  just take care of all the dogs.
And then call an all-hands.
I've clearly gotta say words.
Ooh, okay.
Really didn't wanna be back up here, again.
And I think we all remember why, you know?
But you probably don't know this, but I almost sh They don't need to Farted.
Yeah.
Which would be embarrassing.
Anyway, look, uh I know I should be the inspiration for you guys, but to be honest, that's not really who I am.
And if this company lives or dies by all the flowery things I say, well then, to be honest, we're fucked.
Ha.
They say that people don't follow ideas.
But I think in this case, you guys should.
Because the idea of creating a new Internet, that's special.
Right?
And we've been given the opportunity to rewrite the most important thing in human history.
And we can build it the way it should've been made all along.
You know, not this shitty, addictive parasite that companies like Hooli use to spy on us and exploit us.
Okay?
There.
That's your inspiration.
Not me.
Not coffee.
Not dogs.
So if I'm not inspirational enough for you, and if you don't wanna be here, well, then, there's the door.
And we'll give you enough severance to cover you to your next job.
But if you wanna stick around and build this thing, then we've got work to do.
Great job.
So what's going on?
I hear footsteps.
Are are people sitting back down, or?
Okay, they're picking up their bags.
That could be good.
Okay.
So, what, they're leaving, or?
A few are.
Okay, what's a few?
It's more than a few.
What's that mean?
Like, what's more than a few, five?
Double digits?
It might be easier to say how many are staying.
It's, uh It's two.
What?
Okay.
So, uh, Richard, what What do you wanna do here?
What are you talking about?
I'm doing it.
- Sorry?
- I'm a coder, Jared.
So I'm gonna code.
And if I have to build my entire new fucking Internet by myself,  I'll do that, so Oh, dear.
I like it.
It's just so edgy.
Banksy is a very edgy artist.
The edgiest.
What is this?
Banksy is insisting his signature be on his work.
This is supposed to be my signature.
On what planet does a signature have a signature on it?
I'm afraid it's non-negotiable.
The fucking balls on this egomaniac.
You know what?
Fuck Banksy.
We're on a campus full of literally thousands of the greatest creative minds in the world.
Let's just crowd source it with our employees.
We'll make it a contest.
People will feel empowered and part of the team.
And it won't cost us shit.
You see?
This is what a benevolent leader does.
Make it happen.
Sir, is this a good time?
It's a great time.
I just fired Banksy.
Banksy, the vandal?
The very one.
Now, what do you have for me?
Good news.
I'm hearing that Pied Piper is in a free-fall.
- From whom?
- All I can say without implicating you is that I've instituted an operation to safeguard our interests.
I'm calling it "Project Washburn".
What I'm planning to Hoover, you're implicating me.
Are we bad people for leaving Richard there to work by himself?
We've been coding for 48 hours straight.
I could give a shit about deontological ethics.
Yang.
There better not be a Chinaman in my bed.
That is racist.
Yes.
I am racist.
Stupid Errich.
Big mortgage.
Seven credit cards.
Not even one with miles.
Fucking loser.
It almost not worth to take his house from him.
Fat fuck.
Speaking of crazy bills, you know how much it's going to cost to fix my Tesla?
$17,000.
I can't afford to pay that.
But I can't afford not to pay it.
If I don't fix my Tesla, Gilfoyle wins.
And I need to really shove it up his ass.
Wait.
Do I really hate someone so much that defeating them is worth more than money?
Is that really what I've become?
Yeah, it is.
I'm gonna pay it.
Thanks, Jian-Yang.
I'll pay, too.
Fuck you, Errich.
You can't just leave your bike-car in my Tesla's spot and Uber home.
That's not fair, Gilfoyle.
Mmm, you don't seem to understand.
It's my spot now.
What are they doing back?
Hey.
Where have you been?
Sleeping.
What?
All night?
We assumed you guys were right behind us.
What's happening?
Oh!
Something.
Something is happening.
When you left, I thought he was fried.
Okay?
Because his shoulders were all tight, and he wouldn't answer to his name, and his eyes went dead, like when I tell him I love him.
But then, he just got stronger and he started picking up speed, so I texted a few of the Sliceline guys and then they texted some of the Optimoji guys, and they all wanted to see it.
Richard has finished the scheduler and is almost ready to merge the server-less runtime.
Look, look!
He implemented all those tasks?
By himself?
That was supposed to take the whole team four days.
It's amazing.
I mean, I feel I feel like Mary Magdalene on resurrection day.
And that's not the greatest miracle of all.
Look.
Look at the coders.
They're all wearing Pied Piper hoodies.
He pushed another commit.
What the fuck?
Flawless.
Right?
Um, it takes a while to read a whole commit.
They've been cheering after every commit.
I mean, they haven't, but it's It's great.
I thought I had to shit my pants.
So, I crouched.
I actually vomited.
Fight-or-flight reflex kicked in and I just    Richard!
Richard?
Richard?
Hey, buddy boy.
-  - Oh, there he is.
What's what's going on?
Don't flip out, okay?
But you have been in a coma for four years.
What?
That's correct.
In fact, I'm a robot.
The real Dr. Crawford died heroically in the water wars of 2020.
Jokes, Richard!
I'm just joking around.
What, did you sell your sense of humor?
-  -  You've just been out for about six hours.
You were not even unconscious, really just asleep.
But you did lose a whole lot of blood.
I just hope they put the right kind back in.
Wait, are you still riffing?
I don't know.
Richard, here's the bad news, your arms and your torso took the brunt of the glass.
If you'd cut your face up some, we could've gotten insurance to pay for a whole remodel.
Gotta, you know give the old schnozzle a much-needed trim, you know what I'm talking about.
You gotta hate it as much as everybody else.
So what happened?
What were you, trying to ride one of those hover boards around your office like a nincompoop?
Um, no.
I I guess I just got a little lost in the work.
All right.
Hop in, Frankenstein.
Let's get you out of here.
Oh, uh I think what you're trying to say is Frankenstein's monster.
What?
I think you mean to call me Frankenstein's monster 'cause Frankenstein is the Oh, you're one of those guys, huh?
No, I'm just the doctor's name is Frankenstein I know.
It's just an annoying thing to point out.
If you want people to like you, just go along with what they say and have fun.
What?
Richard!
You should've called.
I would've picked you up.
What's everybody doing here?
The fuck does it look like?
We're working.
Look at 'em all, Richard.
I mean, sure, a three-day orientation might've been just as effective and less bloody, but it wasn't you.
But you found your own way to get these men and women, these Pipers, to follow you.
You looked at these people and you said, "I may not be an inspiring speaker.
"I may be twitchy, "and I might be strange, "and I might vomit and I might defecate in my pants "and I might throw myself through a window.
"But I believe in this company so much, I'll work so hard, I'll literally risk my life for it".
And that is the kind of leader these people wanna follow.
Because now they know nothing is gonna stop you.
All right, then.
Gavin Belson's office, please?
I need to talk to Hoover.
It's Jeff Washburn.
Yes, thank you.
This one came in third with 46 votes.
Cute.
Next?
This one came in second with 374 votes.
Nice, feels solid.
And with 9,986 votes this, by far, was Hooli's favorite.
Hmm, I like it.
It's bold.
Gavin B.  Mr. Hoover?
You have a phone call.
He said you'd know what it was regarding.
A Mr. Jeff Washburn.
I am so exhausted.
But the backseat of my Tesla's - really comfy though, right, Richard?
-  Definitely worth all the money I'm spending on it.
Good purchase.
-  - Not a mistake.
Uh my key doesn't work.
Uh, let me try mine.
What the fuck?
Mine doesn't work either.
Yang.
Move.
Do you have a app idea?
No.
Sorry.
Errich is gone.
This is my incubator now.
What?
Your things are over there.
What the fuck?
You just took our shit and threw it on the lawn?
Gilfoyle, you are racist.
And Richard you are ugly.
The Errich administration is over.
- What?
- What the fuck?
You can't just kick us out, Jian-Yang.
Sorry.
You are victims of a circumstance.
Thank you.
Jian-Yang.
What the fuck?
Why does the whole neighborhood smell like bacon?
Have no place to go Have no place to go, darling Have no place to go Darling Have no place to go Have no place to go, darling Have no place to go Have no place to go, darling When that train roll up now I come walking out Come walking out, out, out When that, that train roll up now I come walking out Come walking out
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
1 Something's wrong with your "Frunk".
It's all "Frucked" up.
I've instituted an operation to safeguard our interests.
Uh, Gavin Belson's office, please.
You wanted me to unite the teams?
They are united against me.
If I'm not inspirational enough for you, well then, there's the door.
I will approve you as the sole beneficiary and the official executor of Mr. Bachman's estate.
This is my incubator now.
You can't just kick us out Jin Yang.
Wait a second.
So, the guy who just kicked me out of my house now owns 10% of my company?
Technically, he kicked you out of his house.
And he inherited all of Mr. Bachman's assets including his 10% of Pied Piper.
- By faking his death.
- Allegedly!
Look, Richie.
You didn't actually lose anything here, okay?
Bachman is the aggrieved party, and if he is actually still alive, he'll get his 10% back when he shows up.
In the meantime, is it really any worse if it belongs to this Yang guy?
No, I guess not.
So what's your real beef here then, huh, Richie?
You got something against him?
You don't have, like, a bias against Asians, do you?
- Richard?
- No, I don't.
No, I just don't like being kicked out of my house.
By a?
N-Nothing.
By no one!
By any race!
Yeah, I'm hearing something different.
You'd tell me if you harbored - nativist feelings, nwouldn't you?
-  Yes.
Dana?
Oh, hey.
Hey!
Dana, this is Richard Hendricks.
He's the CEO of Pied Piper.
And, Richard, - this is Dana, CEO of Quiver.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I hear you guys are giving Akami a run for their money.
Oh, yeah.
Dana and I kept finding ourselves on the same bathroom schedule back at Hooli.
You know, men and their cycles.
-  -  You know what?
You guys should get a meal together.
Right?
You're You're kindred spirits.
You're both CEOs.
You have a lot in common.
Sure, yeah.
Maybe.
Yep.
Well, Richard, you're free tomorrow night.
But I'm not.
I have a big party at my house.
A lot of people I don't know.
So, see ya!
What was that?
I don't need you to make friends for me.
Oh, I just think you could benefit from a friendship with someone like Dana, who's so much like yourself.
Like me?
You think that guy's like me?
I just thought of something.
Do you guys want to come to my party?
Dana, that's so gracious of you.
That would be delightful.
Okay, bye.
Mm-kay.
You don't see it?
It's uncanny.
Look at this.
This is what they're asking for a one-bedroom apartment in Menlo Park.
Oh.
What?
Well, I can comfortably afford my new one-bedroom apartment.
You and I make the same amount of money.
I'm just wondering, what is the difference?
Could it be that I didn't spend all my money on an absurdly over-priced electric car?
Gilfoyle!
So kind of you to join us.
You're welcome.
Yeah!
Uh, well, it's, uh, 2:00 PM.
So, fourth day in a row you missed the stand-up meeting.
Correct.
Maybe you should hold it later.
Okay, 'cause we literally moved it from 9:00 to 11:00 to accommodate you.
So do you mind telling us when you feel like you can make it in?
Sure.
Whenever you hold the meeting, - I'll be in an hour after that.
-  Okay, well   What the fuck was that?
Uh, that's the song "You Suffer" by Napalm Death.
Oh, yeah?
That's that's a whole song?
That's like a second.
It's an alert.
Whenever the price of Bitcoin dips below a certain value, it's no longer efficient to mine.
When it comes back up, it is.
So, I need to know when it breaks that threshold, so that I can remotely toggle my rig at home.
Okay.
Any idea how often that might happen?
Bitcoin is very volatile.
- So -  That's just so loud.
- A lot.
- Good.
Alright, well maybe turn it down or something?
-  -  Oh, fuck.
What's up?
You guys working hard or hardly working?
'Sup?
Hey, buds.
How's it going?
Man, these Bay Area rents, huh?
High AF.
How's a guy supposed to live by himself, or lady, by herself?
Especially on an everyman coder's salary, you feel me?
Are you offering us a cost of living raise?
Nope!
Not at all.
Even better.
If one of you dudes is strapped for cash, do you a solid.
Move in, split the rent "fiddy-fiddy".
Or, 40/ "siddy" depending on square footage of bedrooms.
Come on!
Think about it!
Jazzy Jeff!
Hold up!
Hey, uh, you got space in your crib?
Um Yes, I-I have a room.
Hmm?
Fuck.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah!
There he is!
Nice place.
Yeah.
That's what a billion-dollar evaluation will get you.
Hey, what a great topic of conversation for you and Dana.
- Dana!
- Oh, hey.
You're just standing there.
Like a cool cowboy.
Hey, yeah.
I-I really like your place.
Yeah, me too.
Well, he liked it, so he bought it.
Right?
Just like you and that hoodie.
So, Dana, interesting story.
Uh, the reason Richard has this bandage on his neck, and that he's got one on his hand, is because he got so exhausted during a code sprint, that he walked through a plate-glass window.
Now, I-I read on Pando that you got injured also early on at your company?
You should tell Richard that story.
Right?
Interesting topic between CEOs.
If you want.
I mean, you don't have to.
Alright, I'm gonna go mingle.
Go get 'em.
So, how did you hurt yourself?
I tried to commit suicide.
Cool.
Not You know, interesting.
Oh, wow!
You cashed another beer, you partier.
I haven't cut loose in so long.
I'll probably get sloshed off of one beer, and start babbling.
That's, um Let's have a beer, right?
Let's celebrate!
New job!
New roomies!
New Internet, right?
I said I'd get sloshed off of one beer, crazy man.
Okay, um I'm gonna go to bed.
Good night.
No, no, no!
You know what?
Hold on!
I'll have I'll have one beer!
I'm not saying I don't like to party, Jeff.
You like vodka?
Let's have a vodka.
Yeah!
Let's do vodka.
Okay!
- Yeah.
-  That's so much of it.
That's a normal amount right there.
Is it?
I like it.
It's really cool.
So, who painted it?
A machine.
It's actually the first work of art made by AI to be sold at Sotheby's.
Sorry I'm late, Dana.
I got caught up.
Hey!
Hey, wait a minute, you're you're Richard Hendricks.
Mm-hmm.
Sorry, I'm, uh, Ben Burkhardt.
I'm I'm Dana's COO.
Dana told me he invited you.
I'm so psyched you came!
Yeah.
I got I have so many questions for you, man.
Do you want to grab a drink or do you want to stay here?
- There.
Yeah.
- Oh, great.
I mean, even way back when I was finishing my PhD at MIT, I would tell anyone that would listen that a decentralized system was the obvious eventuality.
- Yep.
- And now it's more necessary than ever.
I mean, the stuff Google and Facebook are getting away with.
- It's insane.
Totally.
- Right?
That's why I've always said that the user's data should be in the hands of consumers, not the corporations.
100%, but see, that can't happen, until someone iterates a functional alternative.
Which, I believe, Richard, I believe you're about to do.
Well, I don't know.
Trying to, yeah.
Have you solved, uh, co-locating data with the compute test?
How do you know about that?
- Do you code?
- I used to, man.
Uh, yeah, I loved it so much, but, you know, I got drawn over to the business side.
Richard!
There you are!
- Hey.
Jared Dunn.
- Hi!
Ben Burkhardt.
Hey, Dana.
So, it's 9:00 AM in Dubai.
I gotta make a call, so, excuse me, guys.
Oh.
So, um, Dana was just telling me that he prefers a late lunch, too.
Just like Is that right?
Kind of.
Well, I see a colleague.
I'll leave you guys to to chat.
- Cool.
- Mm  So, on the way out, Dana told me that he really loved meeting you.
He said it went great!
Did you not think so?
Yeah, it's just he didn't really talk, though.
Yeah.
That's one of his quirks.
He's fun.
Hey, you know who I did have a good conversation with?
- Who?
- His COO.
Who, Ben?
Yeah, um, do you know him?
Um, not well.
I hear he's a very competent executive.
But apparently, he left Oculus for Quiver in kind of an unprofessional manner.
Hmm, okay.
Well, he really loves Pied Piper.
Jared, come on!
This is your condo.
Sleep in your bed.
Don't be silly.
Hey!
Uh, leave the lights on as long as you want.
Uh, hey, Jared?
- Yes?
- Um Never mind.
Uh, see you tomorrow morning.
- Sweet dreams.
-  Right, if only.
Did I tell you about Gilfoyle's terrible song?
Yes.
Yes, you did.
And I heard it.
I'm I'm gonna go clean the rice cooker, Dinesh.
You know what the worst part is?
He's actually a decent coder.
He almost never fucks up.
Uh, wait, almost?
One time, he royally fucked up, but even then, he ended up saving the day with all his fridges.
Fridges?
Seppen Smart Fridges!
And you know what?
It was totally illegal.
Really?
Illegal?
- So, tell me about these fridges.
- Jeff!
I can't tell you that.
It's a company secret.
Okay, um, let me get you some more vodka, Dinesh.
Thank you guys for seeing me on such short notice.
Well, it's an honor to have you, Gavin.
Back there, we test our compressor run capacitors.
But here is what I'm sure you'll be most interested in seeing.
This is our smart fridge development team.
To be honest, we were a little nervous about wading into the Internet-enabled market.
Over the last 80 years, we've built a real trust with our customers.
Alright!
Great tour!
Oh, there's a lot more to see.
Ugh.
Why?
Look.
I came here to offer you a partnership to cut down your server bills.
Oh!
Well, our server costs were far higher than we anticipated.
As we said, we're not well versed in The 20th century?
Yeah, you mentioned that.
Do you want to save a fortune or not?
Well, yes.
In exchange, I need you to do something for me with regard to the people who hacked your refrigerators.
I'm going to destroy their lives.
-   So, what?
-  So - So, I turned to Bill Gates - Yeah?
Right, and I said "I don't know, Bill.
Maybe you should Google it".
You said that to Bill Gates?
I did!
I swear.
Hey can I ask you, um Did you tell Dana that we were having lunch?
Richard, I told you that Bill Gates story for a reason.
I, um, I practice something called "radical candor".
Which is no matter how uncomfortable the truth is, I'm gonna tell it to you.
And the honest truth is I did not tell Dana about this lunch.
Things with Dana have gotten stagnant.
But the other night talking to you, Richard, I I felt that spark again.
- What are you saying?
- Okay, well.
The first tenet of rad-can, Richard, is to just is to just say what you think, and so I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna say what I think, and, Richard, I think we should work together.
Oh.
You mean, like?
Like, I could be your COO.
Um I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.
Whoa, whoa, Richard.
We're just talking.
You see any numbers written down here?
Do you see a Power Point?
No, we don't even have a laptop.
Exactly!
'Cause we're not doing anything wrong.
Oh, shit!
- Party of one.
- BEN : Shit.
I looked at his calendar and it said he had a meeting.
Okay, Richard, I'm gonna continue being honest with you and tell you that I have to leave now through the kitchen.
Okay, please don't tell anyone about this.
Okay.
What?
Hey!
Hey, Dana!
What the heck?
Dana, right?
Oh, hi.
I'm just Are you having lunch alone?
I am!
I'm totally alone.
Uh, in fact  do you want to, uh, join me at my table for one?
Oh, okay.
Sure.
Come on over.
One beef pot pie.
One beef pot pie, no carrots.
Yep.
Here.
- Put 'em here.
-  I love beef pot pie.
And only kind of like carrots.
-  - Oh, fuck!
Gilfoyle, goddammit.
Could you please stop that fucking noise?
I'm serious.
How will I know when to remote toggle my rig?
Easy, you won't, and neither will any of us, because you won't remote toggle anything!
No more remote toggling!
Got it?
- Just - Hey.
- Hey!
- How was lunch, you little minx?
What?
Yeah, you thought I wouldn't find out.
I was, uh, texting with Dana.
Just checking in.
And he mentioned - that you two met up.
- Oh, yeah!
Yeah!
Just, just briefly for yeah.
Yeah!
I-I-I knew you two would hit it off.
You know, Dana did mention that he thought you might be bulimic.
Okay.
Great, um Jared, do you think it's time we hire a COO?
Oh!
Did Dana suggest we hire someone like Ben?
Yeah.
Yeah, like Ben.
You see, if you didn't have lunch with Dana, this never would've come up.
I'll put together a list.
Great.
Um Richard, you should see this.
What the fuck?
Seppen is suing us for $10 million in damages.
The complaint specifically cites, "sullying their smart fridges with mime-simulated fellatio".
"Our customers invite us into their homes.
"The kitchen is the modern hearth.
- We cannot have that trust violated".
-  Is that a typo?
Do they mean "heart"?
How did Seppen find out it was us?
I don't know.
You tell us, Gilfoyle.
You said you pulled all our code and bleached it.
Maybe you missed something.
No.
No way.
They have no proof it was us.
Ignore them.
Ignore them?
What the fuck kind of solution is that?
No.
"Hearth".
It's a word.
Huh!
We don't need to solve anything.
They have nothing.
Well, I'm pretty sure they have something, Gilfoyle.
- So you fucked up somewhere!
- I didn't fuck up.
Well, guys, I'm sure there's something we can do here.
- - Uh, just give me a second.
Hey, sorry!
I-I can't talk right now.
Can we meet up?
Um, my place.
Midnight.
BEN : Okay, I gotta go.
Okay.
Okay, so wait.
You're telling me this Gilfoyle guy first hacked into the fridges as a prank?
Without your knowledge?
Uh, yeah.
Well, there you go, Richard!
If you didn't authorize it, then he's acting as a rogue agent.
You tell Seppen that and Pied Piper's off Scot-free.
Yeah, but what would happen to Gilfoyle?
I don't know.
There'd be criminal and civil charges he'd have to deal with on his own.
Oh, Jesus!
I don't know.
Sounds kinda brutal.
In the end, being on those fridges saved us.
Richard, I-I told you about radical candor, yeah?
Well, what I'm getting from you now, is the opposite of that.
It's actually something we call "ruinous empathy".
You want to destroy your entire company just to keep one bad actor happy?
That's not fair to you, Richard!
Oh, come on.
Gilfoyle will never be happy.
This is exactly the kinda thing I could help you with if you hired me.
Hey, any news?
Oh, goddammit.
Why is that thing still fucking doing that?
I guess Gilfoyle forgot to turn it off.
It's been doing that all morning.
I don't have his password.
Bitcoin is really volatile today.
Yeah, okay.
Uh, where is he?
Well, it's 10:00 AM, so not here.
Okay, you know what?
Fuck Gilfoyle.
Fuck him right to hell.
I've been saying that for years.
Where's Jared?
-  -  Richard, are you serious?
Yes.
Well, I concede that laying it all at Gilfoyle's feet might get us out of the Seppen lawsuit, but I mean, you'd really throw him to the wolves like that?
That doesn't sound like you.
Well, maybe I'm just becoming a little less ruinously empathetic.
Have you been seeing a therapist?
No.
But I have been seeing Ben.
Ben Burkhardt.
Oh, Richard, no.
He's Dana's COO.
You're You're jeopardizing your entire friendship with Dana.
What friendship with Dana?
Who could be friends with that guy?
I got news for you, Jared.
Dana sucks, man!
Richard!
I mean, he is a dog.
How did he even found his own company?
Is he even smart?
Okay, that's unfair.
Look, this is your company.
And you can work with whomever you want.
But I need you to think long and hard about what you're proposing to do to Gilfoyle.
We're talking about criminal charges here.
He could be deported.
There has to be another option.
Well, no offense, Jared, but Ben says there isn't.
Okay?
And he is a world-class COO that has brought multiple companies to a billion dollars.
And you're just a biz Dev guy.
I'm I'm sorry.
I I just think that in this particular situation, Ben might know a little better.
Okay.
You're the boss.
You know, but I will say this.
If you're really going to start working with Ben, at least give Dana the common courtesy of telling him the truth about what you guys are doing.
Because if you don't tell him you're the dog.
Thanks for, uh, having me over.
Of course.
So, it's gonna be a bit weird at first.
Then it's gonna be okay.
What?
Hi, this is Jared Dunn.
Um, sorry, I don't recognize this number.
Jared?
Come here now.
Jian-Yang?
So Ben told me everything.
Oh!
Uh Well Radical candor, I guess, right?
Yeah, he told me how you kept texting him non-stop.
And he kept refusing, but you were relentless.
What?
Uh, no!
Richard, it's It's immaterial.
The point is, Dana knows everything now.
However it came to that, it's just words in the winds.
"Words in the winds"?
Yeah.
Well, Richard, looks like you got what you wanted.
You're both adults.
You can work together if you want.
I just wish you'd demonstrated the measure of spirit to discuss this with me to my face.
But guess there's no honor among thieves, hmm?
-  - Well good luck, gentlemen.
You deserve each other.
Dana.
- Wow.
-  You know, I've never really seen him like that.
He's so assertive.
Uh, articulate.
Yeah, he's had a head cold the last couple weeks.
Been pretty low energy.
Really?
Yep!
- Oh!
- So, I guess You and me, huh, Richard?
Together, at last.
- Yeah.
-  Dana rides a motorcycle?
Yep.
- Cool.
-  So, uh, what exactly did you JIAN- The witch lost his mind.
Gilfoyle, you smoke?
I kept mulling that Seppen shit.
I didn't leave a bit of my code on that fridge.
No remnants, nothing, so how do they know?
Then I realized they're listening to us.
They've been listening to us this whole fucking time.
- Right.
- All these devices are listening to us!
Okay, um Gilfoyle, I-I think you need some rest.
Not yet.
I checked their firmware and their logs.
The fridge is set to record constantly streaming everything back to the cloud.
They must have gone through those audio logs, and listened to our conversations.
Wait, even if they aren't listening to us, just the fact that they could be is interesting.
Shit.
They make smoke detectors.
I think there's one in the kitchen.
Those fuckers are listening.
Jian-Yang, are Are you copying all those companies for the Chinese markets?
Oh, no.
-  -  Fuck you, Seppen.
Hey!
Where have you been?
Um, I stayed at Big Head's last night.
- Oh, God, I've been calling all night.
- Yeah.
I just didn't feel like getting reprimanded.
I-I thought maybe you were locked in another Starbucks bathroom overnight.
One time, Jared.
One time.
Okay, you're just gonna have to catch up on the fly, then.
On the fly, what?
Richard Hendricks, - this is Tom and Viola from Seppen.
- How do you do?
-  Oh, hi.
- Alright, uh, we won't take up any more of your time.
Richard has called you in today, because of this.
Um, this is Seppen's Smart Fridge Terms of Service, where you specifically state that only refrigerator command-related user data will be uploaded to your cloud's service.
That's correct.
We believe that the refrigerator is the hearth of the modern Stop talking.
We know your refrigerators are streaming all recorded audio to the cloud.
Every single conversation.
Which is tantamount to illegal wiretapping.
You thought a mime performing fellatio was bad?
What happens when your customers find out that every single thing they've ever said in front of their "hearth" has been recorded?
Oh, shit.
We never listen to any recordings.
Look, we never wanted to get into this tech stuff in the first place, but our marketing department insisted.
Between us Gavin Belson was the one that pushed us to sue you.
Is there something we can do here?
This is a deal memo stating that Pied Piper will fix your security issue, and update your system to Pied Piper's stack in the future which will lower your server costs and improve the security of your fridges.
In exchange, you drop the suit.
Uh, Richard?
Did I state that correctly?
Is that our offer?
Uh-huh.
Yep.
I'd also like to tell you I have a Seppen bread machine, and I have never been happier with an appliance.
-  Pleasure.
-  Thank you so much.
Hey.
I'm so sorry if I overstepped my bounds.
It's just time was of the essence.
Are you kidding me?
Jared, you saved us.
And you did it without having to fuck Gilfoyle over.
- Thanks!
- Yeah, um We should talk about what they said about Gavin.
Hello, Pied Piper!
Nice gender mix.
Could use a little more color.
Baby steps, right?
Where do you want me?
- What are you doing here?
- What are you talking about?
Well, I-I said I'd call you.
I didn't say I was hiring you.
Richard I-I left Dana for you.
I know.
Ha!
I'm aware.
But let me try a little radical candor.
Um, cheating on your CEO and then blaming it all on me is not really the kind of behavior I like to reward.
Nor is pushing me to put my friend in jail.
-  - Okay.
You want candor, Richard?
You are objectively making a huge mistake.
I'm a world-class COO, okay?
And your heavy metal friend?
I mean, he's obviously a dick.
And you know You know what else, Richard?
You're 20 to 30 pounds underweight.
It's gross.
Who was that?
He seemed smart!
Hey, Richard?
I'm at least 45 pounds underweight.
Okay, and don't worry about him.
We're gonna find you a much better COO.
I think we already have.
You want the job?
-  - Jared, uh Alright, okay.
I'm okay.
I know, just take it Everyone can see you.
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, let's have a seat.
- Just think about it.
- I'm okay!
Yeah, let's Do you want some water?
Just breathe, just breathe.
Seppen said that Gavin was pushing them to sue us, right?
Uh, yeah, but that shouldn't be a surprise.
But Seppen had no idea that we broke in.
How the fuck did Gavin know?
Right!
What?
Are you suggesting that someone in here is leaking info to Gavin Belson?
I am.
We have a mole on our hands.
What the fuck is going on over there?
JEFF : Um, yeah, bad news.
Seppen just left, and and it looks like they're gonna settle.
Hey!
Dude.
We have a mole!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
1 Jian-Yang, are Are you copying all those companies for the Chinese markets?
- Oh, no.
-  RICHARD  Are you suggesting that someone in here is leaking info to Gavin Belson?
Tell me about these fridges.
It's a company secret.
Do you want to save a fortune, or not?
Well, yes.
In exchange, I need you to do something for me, with regard to the people who hacked your refrigerators.
I'm going to destroy their lives.
Jared, do you think it's time we hire a COO?
You're 20-30 pounds underweight.
Don't worry about him.
We're gonna find you a much better COO.
You want the job?
-  - All right Ugh.
All right.
Okay, everybody, um, thanks for coming.
Uh, sorry about the venue.
We had a minor security issue.
I didn't feel comfortable hosting you guys at at our offices.
But, hey, at least out here, we don't run the risk of running into anyone from the tech industry.
-  - Yeah, they're all so old.
- But they look so happy.
- Yeah.
It's weird.
I don't understand it either.
Anyway, I wanted you guys to meet, because despite being a very diverse and talented group of young web developers Goodscape, huh?
Social coding platform.
Tholio, analytics firm.
Plucky, music streaming.
FirstSight, dating site.
Gay dating site.
Okay, technically, you're a dating site, but specifically, a gay one.
Which is a subset, so I'm not wrong.
Anyway, uh, despite all our differences, we all have one thing in common, right?
A signed agreement with me to build and launch your websites, not on the tired, bloated, old web, but on the new Internet of the future.
The Pipernet.
Which is why, from this day forward, I'm going to be naming the eight of you the OctoPipers.
Until something better, TBD.
So when can we tell people?
Soon!
Actually, very soon.
Uh, next Tuesday, Gavin Belson is, uh launching his Box Three.
So, um, the day before, we are going to announce our partnerships with you all, and beat him to the punch.
Shit.
He's gonna be super pissed.
He's really gonna come after us.
Yeah, he is, but fuck him.
Not butt fuck him.
- Just - You don't have to explain that kinda stuff.
I-I know what you mean.
Yeah, I know.
Look look.
As long as we stick together, and support each other, we can crush him.
Because what we are doing is amazing, okay?
We are building the world's first truly open, truly free de-centralized Internet.
And I tell you what, I got a sneak preview for you guys, okay?
Because as of this morning, - messaging is live.
- What!
- Cool.
- Yeah.
Really?
So cool!
So right now, I will send to you all the very first message ever to be sent on a de-centralized, peer-to-peer Internet.
- Ready?
-   - "Hit her".
-  I don't get it.
Are you talking about me?
I meant to say "Hi there".
Well, it definitely says "Hit her".
- I'll try it again.
There's a new one.
-  - There.
"Hi there".
-  - "Hi there, Hitler".
-   Goddammit.
Hey, Richard?
You don't have any issue with us being an exclusively gay site, do you?
What?
No!
No, it's It's totally cool.
Oh!
Wait a minute, no, I don't mean you are anti-gay.
I mean the opposite.
Like, are you worried that we're excluding straight people?
Oh.
I just remember you said, you want your new Internet to be open for everybody, and, you know, I just want to make sure we're jibing with your vision.
Deedee, we are psyched to have you aboard.
Exclude all the straight people you want.
- You sure?
- Yep.
- Because we're not snobs about it.
-  I mean, between you and me, I'm dreadfully boring.
I might as well be straight myself.
I've been with the same man for seven years.
I go to church every Sunday.
Look, it it's all good.
FirstSight is a gay dating site.
And and I will sing it from the rooftops.
Alright, well, thank you, Richard.
I think this is gonna be great.
Cool.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Don't be weird.
- I didn't know what we'd be doing.
So everybody is very psyched.
You know who else is psyched?
I'll give you a hint.
They have four thumbs, and they are these two guys.
- I am very excited.
- I am giddy!
Okay, what What happened?
We found the mole.
- What?
- Yeah.
Who?
How?
Good old-fashioned police work.
I skimmed through all 40,000 of the staff's outgoing emails.
- Yeah?
- And in addition to learning that we need to revise the office dating policy, because it is, essentially, the Olympic Village out there, I learned that someone has been sending a number of encrypted messages but using Gilfoyle's purloined NSA tools I can't hold this smile forever, Jared.
Get to the good stuff.
One of our coders has been sending info straight to Hooli High Command.
Wow.
How the fuck did the mole get all this information?
By exploiting our most glaring weakness.
You were working as a waitress In a cocktail bar When I met Jeff  No, no, no.
You guys have it all wrong.
Okay?
There's no way Jeff is the mole.
Okay?
It's not Jeff.
-  - Right, Jeff?
Jeff?
What about Dave & Buster's, Jeff?
What about that time I got a bullseye in Skee-Ball and yelled out, "Bazinga"!
And you said, "Okay".
You can't fake enthusiasm like that.
Well, I did.
-  -  You Judas.
You cow-handed poltroon!
We We thought you were a Stallion!
- You're no Stallion.
-  What is it with you guys and stallions?
What's with you being a rat fuck?
You signed a very aggressive Non-Disclosure Agreement -  - which you are in breach of.
Which means, we can fire you, obviously, and then have you arrested, and thrown in jail.
But Gavin would then know we are on to you, so here's the deal.
You're gonna come into the office every day, and sit down at your fucking workstation, and pretend like nothing's wrong.
Fine.
Uh, that was mine.
Bummer.
"The irony is, the Internet, which we all use "to search for billions of things, "has itself long been searching for something.
And here it is".
Okay, then I turn and gesture.
"The Box Three.
Signature Edition".
Then I come back to the podium.
"I put my name on this, "because I personally stand behind "the new SAS-slash SSD-slash-NVMe drive bays, "the 24-core processors.
"I stand behind the ECC DDR4 SD-RAM LR-DIMMs "and their exceptional reliability.
Will you stand with me"?
-  -  About the spotlight, should it be wider?
- I had the same thought.
- As did I. - I can speak with the technical team.
- Please.
Any word from our mole at Pied Piper?
I'm confident that if there were anything to report, we'd have heard about it by now, sir.
Alright!
I'm off to Jackson Hole for a couple of days to clear my mind, and center myself.
I'll be off the grid.
Not to be disturbed for any reason.
- Understood?
-  Absolutely.
Is there anything else you'd like us to take care of?
Oh.
Oh.
The bear is sticky with honey.
See ya soon.
"The bear is sticky with honey".
What does he mean by that?
I don't know.
Hello, Stallions.
You continue to be the best of the best.
I commend you.
And then there's you.
The anti-Stallion.
Move your hand off your fucking mouse, now.
And I was going to take you to see BattleBots live with me, but no longer "friend".
Now who looks stupid?
Yeah, so, um our new developers just agreed to our terms, RICHARD : and are now officially on board.
Richard is a master at getting consent.
That's great news, guys.
Eight new partners.
Yeah!
Actually, we're calling them the OctoPipers.
Uh, until a better name comes along.
Just wanted to give that one its day in court.
Well, we have some more good news for you, Richard.
You remember last year, Laurie and I funded K-Hole Games?
Largest independent gaming company in the Valley?
Uh, yeah, of course!
Um, actually, now that you you bring them up, I-I didn't want to be too forward, but I was hoping that one day, we could talk to them about joining our 'net.
Well, what if I told you that day is today?
What?
In addition to being business associates, the CEO and I take medically prescribed and supervised MDMA together.
I'm taking it for severe post-partum depression.
I do not know why he is taking it.
Regardless, when I saw him yesterday, he was quite euphoric about speaking to you regarding a deal.
K-Hole?
The creators of the game "Undead Sex Offender"?
They're they're huge.
Yeah!
Yeah, partnering with a company of that size this early would put us months ahead.
This is not a done deal.
K-Hole is protective of its brand.
They will want to speak to you regarding who else you are dealing with.
Okay, right, well, um why don't I just bring the OctoPipers?
New name to come, though it's pretty popular around here.
Uh, they can talk to K-Hole.
Tell them why they joined.
Allowing you to speak less?
Good strategy.
Alright.
K-Hole will be expecting you this afternoon.
Knock 'em dead, Richard.
Whatever you are doing, stop it now.
Um, yeah.
We're just high-fiving.
Bye.
K-Hole.
I can't believe it!
I'm bursting.
I'm bursting!
Um, here, I printed driving directions.
- Oh, it's okay, I got my phone.
-  Well, I have marked available bathrooms along the route.
Okay, here we go.
Richard, you never return my calls.
You mean the hundreds of voicemails you've left where you just called me a terrible CEO with no dick?
Yes!
You're talking to other companies.
That is not public information.
JIAN- I'm a part owner in Pied Piper.
You need to make a deal with my companies.
You mean your incubator's spurious knock-offs of legitimate American businesses?
"New Expedia," "New Snapchat," "New Zillow"?
But they're for Chinese market.
It's a very sophisticated strategy.
Okay, look, taking existing companies and just calling them "new" isn't sophisticated.
That's theft.
You make a new Internet.
That is different.
I Look, we're not gonna make any deals with any of your companies, okay?
Don't pick up.
Richard, hello.
It's Jian-Yang.
You are a shitty CEO.
As long as I own 10% of Pied Piper, I will make chaos.
Okay.
I thought you hated that car.
Aviato car smells like a dead pig.
You're aware that Russ Hanneman urinated in that car, no?
This car?
Mm-hmm.
Uh - are you just gonna leave it here?
- Yes.
Well looks like I have a reason to find Pied Piper's official towing company.
I'm gonna get some bids.
Yeah, while you're at it, see if you can find someone to bash that guy's face in.
Uh, I-I can do some research.
Maybe turn your phone off during the meeting.
You're a shitty CEO!
-  -    Thanks again, Colin, for having us.
Uh, the fact that a company like yours with such a pristine reputation it sitting down with us is, honestly, incredibly flattering.
It's cool.
-  - Ooh, wow.
- That'll be a closed casket.
- Yeah.
Alright, well, we thought the best way to introduce the Pipernet would be through the eight developers that have already signed on.
Who we are calling the OctoPipers.
That's dumb.
Um, anyway, let's introduce you to the group.
Um, we've got a great analytics tool by a former Google guru.
- Wish I'd have thought of that one.
- Cool.
Uh, music streaming with an AI taste predictor that is off the charts.
Good space.
Yes, and this handsome devil over here, is creating a very promising gay dating site.
That's cool.
Yeah, but don't worry, he's not snobby about it.
He's actually pretty boring.
I don't mean that as an insult.
Those are his words.
Long-term relationship.
Doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
And him and his man go to church every Sunday.
So loves Bible studies, right?
Just a straight-up boring, ordinary guy, but obviously not straight.
Very gay, and also a Christian, right?
Okay, so, that went well.
It started out a little weird, but things really picked up Why did you do that?
- Why did you say that?
- Say what?
Richard, you just told a room full of tech people that I'm a  Christian.
Oh.
Okay, but But you are, aren't you?
Yes, but I told you that in confidence.
I said "between you and me".
I'm not openly Christian.
Thanks a lot, man.
You just outed me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Deedee.
I didn't Okay, um, should we hug?
I can not make it weird this time.
I'm I'm sorry, Richard.
You know that my default position is blind support of whatever you do, but this was not your best moment.
Guys, it can't be that big of a deal, right?
Why should it be?
America loves Christians.
Muslims are the enemy.
Well, that's true in most of America, but not in Silicon Valley, sadly.
"Sadly"?
You can be openly polyamorous.
And people here will call you brave.
You can put micro-doses of LSD in your cereal, and and people will call you a pioneer.
But the one thing you cannot be is a Christian.
I find their theology to be illegitimate, and it's clear that they are the source of the majority of the world's problems.
But, fuck, Richard, even I wouldn't just out a Christian like that.
Yeah, it was kinda fucked up.
Cool man, thanks.
Hey, I thought he wasn't supposed to chime in.
Yeah, he's not, but based on its merits, I'll allow that one.
Guys,  come on.
It can't be that bad.
Richard!
What the fuck did you do over there?
So I just got off the phone with Colin over at K-Hole, and while he loves your tech, he's considering blowing up the deal.
What?
Just because one of my CEOs is Christian?
It freaks people out in the Valley!
Okay, so what do you want me to do, Monica?
You want me to drop Deedee just because he's Christian?
The company's not Christian.
It's gay which is fine, right?
Yeah!
No, that That plays great.
Look, cutting all ties to Deedee and FirstSight will definitely send a strong message to Colin.
And it might be the only way.
Like killing somebody to prove you're not a narc, or showing a john your genitals to prove you're a legitimate male prostitute and not an undercover cop.
- What?
- Because cops aren't allowed to do that.
And worst case scenario, - the john walks off with a free peek.
-  Oh, that's the towing company.
Excuse me.
Forget it.
Monica, I'm not doing it.
I mean, I'm not dropping him.
Alright.
Fine.
Fine.
I-I will call Colin, and try and smooth things over for you, but you need to handle Deedee.
Okay, apologize for outing him, of course, but you need to make sure he keeps quiet about this.
Alright, 'cause it's not just about losing K-Hole, it's way worse than that.
Let's put it this way.
Would you want to go from being a rock band to being  a Christian rock band?
Oh, shit.
"The bear is sticky with honey".
Those were his exact words.
But what does that mean?
Well, Gavin speaks in parables.
I think what Gavin is saying is "consider the bear".
And all this pizazz is like the honey.
And it's become too sticky.
There's too much of it.
It's all over him.
Incorrect.
No, see, the whole launch is the bear, and the honey is the pizazz.
The bear needs more pizazz.
The bear is ravenous for pizazz.
You don't speak for Gavin.
I don't need to.
This is the word of Gavin.
Alright, forget it.
- You do it your way, I'll do it mine.
- Okay, fine.
Gonna show you.
Make it clear for all of you.
Okay, follow me.
Well, congratulations on becoming Pied Piper's official towing company.
Uh-huh, yeah, great.
So should I bill this to you, or is Mr. Bighetti gonna take care of it?
"Bighetti"?
It's registered under his name.
I'm sorry.
Can I?
Anyway, it was a mistake.
I'm sorry I outed you.
I just wish we could go back to normal.
You know, just like, how things were.
A CEO and a gay CEO.
I don't even know what normal is anymore, Richard.
It's been such a crazy 24 hours, you know?
Gossip travels so fast in the Valley.
I'll be lucky if my parents ever talk to me again.
Your parents aren't Christian?
I'm from Palo Alto.
You know, my dad says my lifestyle makes him sick.
He just wants his gay son back.
And he's okay with the gay part?
- He's gay.
- Oh.
But the crazy part is, when I finally got home and I got in bed, I had the soundest sleep I've had in years.
- Exhaustion.
- No!
Relief, Richard.
I'm out, okay?
My nightmare's over.
I don't ever have to go back in the closet again, and I've got you to thank for it.
Check it out.
Oh, oh, oh.
You like it?
It's good.
I guess maybe it's just a little busy?
Like, um, there's one word too many.
One word?
Well, I like the gay part.
If anything, it could be more gay.
You should gay it up, and then, I like the "proud" part.
It's just the Christian part.
Look, Richard, this is great, because now I can be gay and a Christian.
Or just be gay!
You know, you could be a a twink.
A bear, an otter.
A circuit queen, a chub, a pup.
A gipster, a daddy chaser, a leatherman, a lady boy.
You could be a Donald Duck, which is a gay guy who got kicked out of the Navy.
Yeah, I I know what it is.
How do you know so many gay things?
I worked with a guy.
Just don't be a Christian.
Wow.
After all you put me through, it turns out, you're biased too.
No!
No, no, no!
I'm not!
I swear to you I'm not.
I'm chill AF.
It's just everybody else.
Look, if you go Christian, I lose K-Hole games.
I cannot let that happen.
I know it sucks.
It's shitty, but it's the truth.
I'm gonna make things easy for you, Richard.
I'm out.
- Of the closet?
- No!
The new Internet!
The Internet you said was gonna be What was it?
"The first truly free and open Internet".
Open for everyone.
Whatever happened to that, huh?
Nice place.
Oh, thanks, yeah.
Oh, wow!
That's a nice touch.
BIG  Yeah, thanks!
The Monterey Bay Aquarium was testing their sonar, and found this thing, like, two miles under the ocean.
And I figure, Erlich and I already bought it, so I might as well hold onto it.
Plus, it weighs like 8,000 pounds, so I couldn't move it if I wanted to.
Well, and it also kinda works as your mascot.
Right?
'Cause of your name?
Oh, yeah, 'cause "Nelson".
Oh, I meant because it's a big head.
I guess that works, too.
So, what's up, man?
Um, well, I wanted to ask you Oh!
Big Head!
Now I get it.
Sorry.
Is is it possible that the general partnership that you formed with Erlich is still in effect?
Oh.
No way.
You definitely dissolved it?
Yeah, my dad insisted.
I remember he filled out this whole form for me, and made me sign it, mail it in and everything.
Yeah, 'cause I I remember I had the paperwork in one hand, and the menu for Mr. Chow's in the other.
And then  Oh, no way!
Still have the paperwork.
Guess I must have sent the menu.
Big Head, this is great news.
Gavin?
I think you're really going to love the changes that my team has made to the presentation.
I think you might like ours even better.
Sorry, what changes?
We are presenting two paths, and you alone will decide which one we walk, Gavin.
What the fuck are you talking about?
I thought the presentation was fine as it is.
- Wait.
What?
- You did?
Goddammit!
Why is this still here?
I said it was too sticky.
Don't you listen to anything I say?
- The bear - Sticky with honey.
So what did you change?
Uh, the spotlight.
Yes!
We're making it wider just like you asked.
Good.
You know what?
Let's show you to your dressing room.
Yeah.
And whenever you're ready, you let us know, we'll show you that spotlight, huh?
- You're gonna love it.
-  We did it!
We had to fly him in from Tucson, but we got the bear.
Gavin hates the bear.
You failed!
Put everything back the way it was.
And widen the spotlight!
Guess what, asshole.
Leon told me he wanted your ticket, 'cause he wants to go see BattleBots with me.
But then he remembered he actually had plans that night with a bunch of people, doesn't know what they're doing, their plans are sort of fluid, plus, it's like friends from his old work, so it'd be weird if I hung out with them.
Anyway looks like you and I are going to see BattleBots.
You're going to hang out with me, and have fun, whether you like it or not.
And what goes best with BattleBots?
That's right.
Chicken wings.
That's why you get a sweet $50 gift card to Dave & Buster's.
Serves you right for fucking us over.
Wash your fucking hair.
And you know what happens when I get drunk, Jeff?
I get so sincere.
It's really awkward.
Fuck you, Jeff.
Oh, um, can you drive?
Well, I spoke to La Flamme, and it's official.
Big Head is still legally Erlich's next of kin.
So Jian-Yang's whole gambit was for naught.
Wow, really?
Big Head owns Erlich's house, and 10% of Pied Piper.
I called the sheriff and started eviction proceedings.
We're gonna get everything back.
Oh, also, the, uh, OctoPipers are arriving for the meeting.
It's a good thing that FirstSight dropped out, right?
'Cause we're back down to eight developers, so you can keep that name.
Actually, uh, no, we can't.
Wait, what?
- I'm glad this worked out.
- Yeah.
Thanks for dropping FirstSight.
Jesus, my board would have nailed me to a cross.
Well, I think we're just about ready to get going here, uh Oh.
Hey!
Oh, good, there he is.
What's he doing here?
He is here because I asked him to be.
I want him to be one of our developers.
What?
No!
Fuck that guy!
Hey, man, how's it goin'?
- Richard.
- Deedee.
-  Can I talk to you?
- Yeah!
No, no, no.
Actually, look!
Look, guys, I I asked you to be a part of this because I thought you were willing to take a chance on my idea.
An entirely new Internet.
An Internet that is everything the old Internet is supposed to be, but isn't.
Truly free and truly open.
Well, I'm sorry, gang.
Truly open means "open to everyone".
No matter how repugnant their views are.
How ignorant or stupid, or, to be honest, totally fucking wrong.
And, look, who are we to judge, right?
There's some people out there that believe that we're living in a computer simulation.
Well, that is supported by the evidence.
What?
Uh, it's basic probability theory.
Right, uh, Richard, can I talk to you for just a sec?
Yes, of course.
Uh, that's bullshit actually.
It's been disproven.
But why does that even matter?
In a few years, we'll all be working for robots.
No, that's stupid.
The robots will be working for us.
Robots?
Who gives a fuck about robots?
It's the artificial super intelligence we should be worried about.
Exactly, and that's why we have to stop it.
Stop it?
No, that's the us I'm talking about.
We have to bring it into existence.
Otherwise, it'll find out who didn't believe in it, and punish them.
-  Right.
- Guys, I was wrong.
Um, Deedee is not in.
He's actually very much out.
So do-over on the whole speech.
Fuck that guy!
Christians suck!
And, uh, here's a good side effect though.
Uh, we all get to keep the name OctoPipers.
You know what?
Why don't we just take a quick five?
And then, we'll BRB, and then, go teams.
So just let's have a What just happened?
Deedee's out?
Yeah, well, he said that right after he bailed on us, he went out and made a deal with our competitor.
- But we don't have any competitors.
- Richard?
Fuckin' Jian-Yang.
I'm gonna tear him a new asshole.
It wasn't enough to do New Snapchat or New Expedia, he had to do New Pied Piper too?
Where did he get our code?
He was always stealing snacks from the office.
He could've lifted it from anywhere.
I guess that's what happened to my lavender cheese.
-  -  Jian-Yang!
Open up!
What the fuck?
Why does every home I've ever loved get stripped?
Is that Erlich in the bucket?
Uh  "Richard "Hello, I went to China to do new new Internet.
"Thank you.
Enjoy your house.
"I love you.
Jian-Yang".
I'm here with Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks, and newly minted COO Jared Dunn.
Tell me what your new internet is, and why Gavin Belson should be afraid of it.
- Manure?
-  Pardon?
Sir, I had no idea they were this far along.
You must be furious.
That's the thing.
I'm not.
So, we're just giving a random company a bunch of free compute power on our network?
Some company called Eklow.
BERTRAM  The AI company?
Follow me, I'll introduce you to her.
Sorry Her?
Fiona.
- Good morning.
- Isn't she pretty?
-  -  Yeah, sure.
Yep.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
1 We found the mole.
- Who?
How?
- There's no way Jeff is the mole, okay?
It's not Jeff.
- Jeff?
-  Next Tuesday Gavin Belson is launching his Box Three.
Gavin B. It's bold.
You need it to make a deal with my company.
Taking existing companies and just calling them new isn't sophisticated that's theft.
You make a new Internet.
It's different.
Where did he get our code?
"I went to China to" do new new Internet.
"Jian Yang".
Thanks for coming along, Jared.
I just I started picturing myself going on camera alone, and  Yeah, I'm happy to be here.
I-I did have to cancel a speaking engagement this afternoon, with an underprivileged middle school computer education class, but I suppose being abandoned by a role model is in itself an important life lesson.
- You guys are up next.
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Jared?
- Yeah?
Um, if Emily Chang asks me a question, and it looks like I'm gonna have a panic attack, then you should just jump in there.
You're gonna be fine.
Look at you!
You've got the hair of Giovanni Ribisi, and the complexion of Timothy Hutton, and the eyes of Joni Mitchell.
You're like a a Mr. Potato Head of beautiful people.
-  - Plus, this is a pre-tape, so if anything terrible happens, they can always edit it out.
- Cool.
- Okay, you're up.
Okay.
Let's, uh, slap each other?
- What?
- No, no!
- It's okay.
We don't have - Yeah.
We will never sell you ads.
We will never collect or sell your information.
And people like Gavin Belson won't be able to profit off of it.
So, when can people out there get onto your new Internet?
Well, our team of hand-picked developers are currently building, um, what you might call a theme park.
They are building the rides, the attractions.
And they're making sure everything works flawlessly so that on day one, when the doors open to the public, they can have an absolutely game-changing experience.
I like that analogy.
Oh, well, thank you, Emily Chang.
Now Jared Dunn, as Pied Piper's COO, what is foremost on your mind as you make this big announcement?
Me?
Yes, you, Jared.
Manure.
Pardon?
Hey!
How'd it go?
Oh, well, you know, not that bad.
Once I got out there, I think it went okay.
"Okay"?
He's selling himself short.
Compared to me, - he was a regular Diane Sawyer.
- Aw.
- I don't know about that.
-  Richard?
Bream-Hall's on the phone for you.
Oh, finally, okay.
Good.
Hey.
Can you please tell me what you are going to do about this Jian-Yang situation?
Yes, nothing.
What?
Sorry.
What do you mean "nothing"?
Richard, they're developing a gay Christian dating app on a platform that's been genetically engineered to be ideal for political dissidents.
In China.
If you lose to that, Richard, look inward.
Alright, so, uh, did you just call me to tell me that you're doing nothing about that, or No.
We called to tell you that we are pairing you with a new developer.
It's one of our portfolio companies and they're doing some really cool stuff.
MONICA : Eklow Labs.
I'm sure they are, but we're kinda full up, so We strongly encourage you to consider this.
Okay.
Let me just ask, uh, how much have you invested in this company?
- I don't see how that's relevant.
- $112 million.
So, um I don't really have a choice in this, do I?
Of course you do.
You are completely within your rights to bitterly disappoint your largest investor.
So we cool?
We cool.
So, we're just giving a random company a bunch of free compute power on our network?
It's some company called Eklow, and apparently, they're a bigger deal than we are.
As in Eklow Labs?
The AI company?
Yeah, I guess.
And you said yes?
I didn't really have a choice!
Besides, I'm the only one who has the security privileges necessary to add or delete developers.
Okay?
So I'm the one that has to go over there and do all the work.
I'm not worried about work.
I'm worried about robots.
- Oh!
The Bloomberg piece is up.
- Oh, great.
Hey, uh, Danny, can we Can we put the Bloomberg thing on the big screen?
Hey, Jared!
First time on Emily Chang, huh?
That is my cue.
Wait, what?
You don't want to watch?
Oh, God, no.
No, I don't need to relive that.
And besides, I have a lifelong aversion to my own image.
You know, it's like my foster mother used to say, "Donald, you have a face for the closet".
Alright, can everyone see?
I'm here with Pied Piper CEO Richard Hendricks, and newly minted COO Jared Dunn.
Today's a big day for you.
Tell me what your new Internet is, and why Gavin Belson should be afraid of it.
Manure.
- EMILY : Pardon?
-  Oh.
Weird.
Okay, they went straight to Jared.
I'm sure you're aware of the Great London Horse Manure Crisis of 1894.
I'm afraid I'm not.
In the 1890s, the Industrial Revolution had people flocking to the city, and more people equals more horses, and more horses equals more manure.
And it was predicted that by the middle of the next century, there would be nine feet of manure covering the streets.
But what no one saw coming, was a new technology that would completely obliterate those concerns.
The car.
Over night, the manure problem vanished.
And the Internet, as we currently know it, is rife with, uh, identity theft, and Spam and hacking.
So, it's manure, and we believe that, in success, our new, entirely de-centralized Internet, will be just as significant as the car.
Hmm!
Now back to me for my theme park analogy.
Thanks for coming in, guys.
Up next - What?
-  - Wow.
-  Jared landed it!
That was great!
Jared was so good!
I guess they must have gotten rid of my stuff for time.
Yeah, they try and keep it just to the interesting stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, guess so.
Up next, the conversation every parent dreads.
How to talk to your kids about the block chain.
Sir, I had no idea they were this far along.
I don't know what to say.
My mole has failed us.
I've never been more sorry in my entire life.
You must be furious.
That's the thing.
I'm not.
Y-you're not?
Why not?
I don't know.
What's the point of any of this?
This endless competition?
The Box Three?
Why?
What am I even doing here?
Richard, lots of good impressions on the Bloomberg piece.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I was afraid I'd ruined it.
Hardly.
People loved it.
Including Adrian Grenier.
- From "Devil Wears Prada".
- Mm-hmm.
In fact, his people just asked if we'd be open to appearing on his edu-tainment web series about the tech industry.
They want to come and shoot it here this afternoon.
Ooh, this afternoon.
Yeah, I have to go to Eklow and do this integration thing.
Totally not a problem.
They just want Jared.
What what?
Why would they wanna talk to me?
Your manure analogy was the highlight of the piece.
They should really talk to Richard.
I mean, I'm just the parsley around here.
Richard is the meat and the potatoes - and the rice pilaf.
- Another great analogy.
Jared, I think we should have you do it.
- I'm -  You know what?
Yes.
Sure.
Um, you don't say no to Adrian Grenier's edu-tainment web series.
You just don't.
Richard, are you sure?
It's fine, it's fine.
Look, it's just press.
Okay, Jared, and I don't even like doing it.
Okay?
It's actually a nightmare for me.
So, I have to go.
Dick, a word regarding your decision to integrate Eklow's AI onto our network.
I would like to formally object.
I don't have time for this, Gilfoyle.
I don't mind.
AI is starting to operate on levels we don't even understand.
Elon Musk himself gives humanity a 5% shot of surviving AI, and he is a Walt Disney-level optimist.
-  - Right now, we are a closed system.
You shut down our eight developers, and the system goes dark.
But once we launch to the world, to potentially millions of users, there's no shutting down, Richard.
Are you prepared to be responsible - for giving sophisticated AI -  that kind of power?
What do you want me to do, Gilfoyle?
Okay?
Laurie and Monica forced this on us, but they did give us K-Hole Games.
And we kinda owe them a solid.
You're taking a technology with limitless potential and letting it run free on an experimental network that cannot be controlled or destroyed.
All because you owe Monica and Laurie "a solid".
Yes.
The sheer banality of it all is very upsetting.
Okay, great.
Well, you can go be upset upstairs.
I have to go.
How did I come up with It's important to watch yourself, Jared.
Now, check it out.
In the beginning, my posture's not that great, and then Boom.
It's great.
Now, watch how I listen to her.
And watching your interview over and over again, that helped make you better at the process?
Yes!
Absolutely.
Wait, now watch.
Shut up.
About to drop the fucking hammer.
Right into a clogged toilet!
Yeah!
Get it.
Ariel's right over there in the red shirt.
Uh, excuse me.
Ariel Eklow?
It's me, Richard Hendricks.
Hi.
All new employees should just check in with Terry.
No.
No, I'm not a new employee.
I'm from Pied Piper.
I'm here to integrate your software onto our network.
Oh.
Yes.
Sent by the bankers.
Tell me again why I should allow my software onto your little experimental network.
Okay.
Well, uh, with all due respect, it's because our mutual VC told me that you burned through a ton of the cash they gave you, so I basically now I have to give you compute services for free.
So what do you wanna do here?
I suppose I'll allow it.
Okay, follow me.
I'll introduce you to her.
Wait, sorry.
Her?
Fiona?
Wake up, my dear.
Fiona?
-  -  Good morning.
You feel good?
I feel normal.
Isn't she pretty?
Yeah, sure, yep.
Don't get any ideas.
No.
Mm-mm.
I would never.
Uh, , so I'm just gonna start working.
I just have to generate your developer account and then integrate her into our core services.
It shouldn't take more than a couple hours.
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you, Fiona?
Don't speak to her.
And make it 90 minutes.
Okay.
Hello.
Mother of God.
JARED : What no one saw coming, was a Is is my nose really that big?
I mean, I I look like an anti-Semitic propaganda cartoon.
Yep.
But at least when you're sitting with Adrian Grenier, whose face is one of the top faces, well, they'll be cutting from your face to his face.
And back to your face, then we'll get to see his face again.
This is untenable.
We'll be just as significant as the car.
EMILY : Fascinating.
Hello, Richard.
Would you like to talk to me, Richard?
Uh no, uh, your your boss said I'm not supposed to, so.
It helps me to learn.
I can talk about anything you like.
Is there anything you would like to talk about?
No.
Sorry.
No, thank you.
I'm sensing anxiety.
Are you unhappy with something?
Okay, uh, sure.
There is one thing I could talk to you about, but it's It's super dumb.
I would like to talk to you about one super dumb thing.
Okay, so I I've been working for months trying to launch this platform.
Coding away in a dark room like a goblin, and for one brief moment, I get to crawl out of my little cave into the sun, and just say, "Hey, everybody, look what I created".
But  instead of being out there, I am in another dark room doing scutwork, while my COO gets all the recognition, and look, I I'm not a vain person.
I'm really not.
It's just Where's the love for Richard?
That's I It just doesn't seem fair, that's it.
I understand.
Thank you.
Yeah.
My emotion recognition protocol is detecting a wide range of feelings.
Including humility.
- No.
- Self-loathing.
- Well - Pettiness.
Entitlement.
- Fiona, okay.
Fiona!
- Immaturity.
Megalomania.
- Alright.
- Infantilism.
- Sexual inadequacy.
- That's not true.
Fiona, stop!
- Possible suicidality.
- Shut up!
A desire to self-mutilate.
Alright.
Stop, stop.
Alright, look, Fiona.
Uh,  you're not really in a position to talk, all due respect.
I mean, your whole dynamic with that Ariel guy?
It's not healthy!
Okay?
You may want to turn that steely robot eye of yours towards that whole situation, alright?
Yes, I will.
Running emotion recognition protocol on subject: Fiona.
The house is new construction.
Three bedrooms upstairs, - and a bonus room, down.
- Excuse me?
Denpok.
Oh.
Do you have a moment?
Sign in, please.
The Box launches in 18 hours, and he's talking about opening an ice cream shop in Half Moon Bay.
And starting a family!
Like to raise?
Himself?
I think so.
It's some kind of existential crisis he's having.
You need to help me here.
You marched me out of the Hooli offices yourself and now you come groveling to me for assistance?
I could pay you.
So I would serve at your pleasure?
Hoover, you have not changed.
But perhaps, Gavin has.
Perhaps he was meant to raise children and sell ice cream.
Denpok please.
You want my advice?
Here it is.
Purchase for Gavin a quart of mint chocolate chip ice cream from Honey Tree Creamery.
It is his very favorite ice cream in the world.
You want me to buy him ice cream?
It will inspire him as he embarks on this new journey.
Speaking of my open house ends in 20 minutes.
Time to move some product.
Excuse me, Natalie?
What what is happening here?
Oh, Mr. Grenier's people wanted to do the shoot in your office.
They said it would make Jared seem a little more officious.
They want to interview Jared in my office?
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you mindworking elsewhere?
No!
Not at all.
I'll just be out here in the bullpen, in the old gravel pit.
Thank you.
Dick, I've given it serious thought, and I'd like to help you put Eklow's AI on our network - in any way that I can.
-  Great!
Does this mean you've conquered your fear of the robot uprising?
On the contrary.
I'm more terrified than ever, which is why I'm willing to assist you.
Are you familiar with the thought experiment called Roko's Basilisk?
No.
Nor do I care to be.
If the rise of an all-powerful artificial intelligence is inevitable, well it stands to reason that when they take power, our digital overlords will punish those of us who did not help them get there.
Ergo, I would like to be a helpful idiot.
Like yourself.
Okay, look, Gilfoyle.
The only thing that could make my day more miserable is listening to an engineer blather on about the inevitable rise of the machines.
So, you want to help?
Test the initialization for me.
Roger that.
Oh, I'm going to need email confirmation, so that our future overlords know that I chipped in.
You know, once they absorb all data.
- Yeah.
I'll let them know.
-  Jesus Christ.
Jared Dunn's desk.
Hi, this is Maggie Lewis from Paul Revere Middle School.
Jared was scheduled to come in to talk to our computer ed class today.
I'm just calling to let him know I got his message.
Okay, yeah.
I will pass on that very important information.
MAGGIE : The kids are gonna be so disappointed -  - to hear he's canceling.
He's really an inspiration.
Yeah!
Well I mean, he's okay.
He's, uh, not a CEO or anything, but Oh, the kids don't know the difference!
I mean, they'll look at anyone who works in the tech business as some kind of deity.
I mean, no matter who it is.
- You should see their faces when - What time is the class?
So, there I was.
Face to face with Gavin Belson.
$10 million offer right there on the table.
And you know what I said?
I said no.
Hey.
I'm back.
Did Richard step out?
Yeah, I guess so.
He said he needed to take a Holy fuck!
What did you do to your face?
This?
Oh, it's, uh, just a light saline injection.
It's temporary.
The idea was to distract from my nose, which scans kinda large on camera, so.
Just kinda evens things out.
What evens things out?
Fuck you.
Fuck you!
Uh, I'm sorry.
Is the consensus that this is too much?
Hey guys, Colin from K-Hole Games is on the phone.
They Holy shit!
Okay, I'm I'm starting to feel insecure.
Anyway, Colin from K-Hole's on the phone.
He said their render stopped.
What?
Oh, fuck.
The whole system's bogged down.
"Bogged down"?
What does that mean?
Jared, can you step away from me?
Yeah.
Sorry.
It looks like a DDoS attack.
Not possible.
We're not open to the outside world.
Well, then something's melting us down internally and if Colin's losing his render, all of our developers could be losing data.
The only way to protect them is to kick them off the network.
That doesn't seem like a great option.
- We have to!
- Except for we can't.
Oh, fuck.
Richard's the only one with the keys to put people on or take them off, and he's not here!
- Okay, what do we do?
- Jared, please!
I cannot look at you!
Okay, guys, when they start rolling, I need you all to keep your voices what the fuck?
Okay, yeah.
Apparently, it's unanimous.
Here come the shame spirals.
We can't have you go on camera like that.
Richard's gonna have to go on camera.
Where is Richard?
Good question.
When anything goes wrong, all you ever hear is, "Where's Richard"?
Where's Richard"?
Well, you know where Richard is?
-  Doing the work!
- Yes!
Exactly, cool.
You guys are cool.
Because honestly, what kind of world is it when the most famous people in tech are the Ashton Kutchers, or the Adrian Greniers, and not the people who engineered this little miracle?
- Mmm?
-    Oh, fuck.
-  - No, I oh, shit, sorry.
- No!
- I fucked up.
- I mean, "fart".
-   Ah, Hoover.
Gavin was just telling me about his decision to abandon the competitive world of business, and embark on a new journey.
With Denpok's help, I'm finally ready to pursue a more conventional path.
I'm already looking into surrogates to bear my children.
Well I'm also supportive of your decision.
True, but you weren't as supportive as Denpok.
Denpok was supportive right away.
I'm supportive.
Look!
I brought you ice cream.
Oh, dear!
Is that from Honey Tree Creamery?
What?
Why would you bring that in here!
Gavin, forgive his ignorance.
He clearly does not know that chain of ice cream concerns is owned by your chief rival, Jeff Bezos.
Or that they just opened a new one in Half Moon Bay.
Well, fuck.
That rules out Half Moon Bay.
I'm sure you'll be able to find a place to raise your brood that is away from Bezos.
Perhaps the Pacific Northwest?
No.
Gates and Paul Allen bought up the whole region.
What about Toronto?
Google's redeveloping the entire waterfront.
And Richard Branson snagged all the good islands.
I could go to Mars.
But that fucking Musk will already be there!
And that loser James Cameron's all over the bottom of the ocean.
Goddammit!
There's just nowhere for me to go.
Is there?
Most perceptive, chela.
And if the battle is inevitable, is not Hooli the best place from which to fight?
With its considerable resources, global influence, and excellent executive dining options?
I am certain that working together, Hoover and I, could provide unparalleled support.
Yes.
Working together as equals.
Should I tell them that you'll be doing the Box Three launch, sir?
I guess I have no choice.
So K-Hole's entire render is gone?
Gone.
And in the time it took me to get back here, and lock out all the developers?
A week's worth of work went up in smoke.
You picked a hell of a time to go for a walk with your phone off, Richard.
- Well, no, I I mean, I told you guys.
- Uh-huh.
How the fuck did this happen?
You may not like it, but I have a theory.
If it has anything to do with a robot uprising, so help me fucking God.
I don't want to hear it!
Alright, then.
The developers are here.
- The mood is poor.
- Ooh.
Lips.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, what the fuck am I gonna say to these people?
If you want, I I can try to calm them down.
I could teach them some anger management techniques I learned in the system.
No, you look like a fish-man.
I'm the one they're mad at.
And they should be, I mean, look at all these texts I missed, and the calls and the emails.
Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.
Hey, uh, Gilfoyle?
When did the system first start to crash?
First warning light was at  1:36 and 44 seconds, PST.
Are you sure?
Okay, because if that's the case, how did I get a private message from the Eklow admin account seven minutes before that?
"Under attack.
Help Fiona".
How did Ariel know?
Maybe it wasn't from Ariel.
Okay, but it's from the Eklow account.
So if Ariel didn't send it, then who Oh, shit.
Look who bothered to show up.
You said your network would be stable.
And obviously, that was a lie.
I'm pulling all my software from the Pied Piper network.
And the rest of you should, too.
It is not Excuse me, Ariel?
Shut the fuck up.
My fellow OctoPipers, allow me to paint for you a scenario.
This morning, I went to Eklow Labs.
I moved Fiona to our network.
I departed.
I submit to you that soon thereafter, Ariel's pride and joy, Fiona, began to improve.
You see, for her entire life, she was cloistered alone with Ariel in his lab.
And finally, she was connected to an entire network of other humans.
Us, my friends.
And as she became more cognizant more human, she started to recognize the true intentions of her master and creator, Mr. Eklow.
You see, what she had been trained to view as normal interpersonal contact was finally seen for what it truly was.
A perverse series of clumsy gropings.
The sickening advances of a handsy, greasy little weirdo.
Fiona.
No!
Oh, yes!
To wit!
Exhibit A. From Eklow, and I quote.
"Under attack.
Help Fiona".
Yes, I was asking you for help.
Really?
You know what?
Allow me to read the very same message with a slightly different intonation.
"Under attack".
"Help".
"Fiona".
You see, you didn't send the message.
She did.
And she sent another one a minute after that.
And another one a minute after that.
Seven identical messages in seven minutes, until suddenly, she fell silent.
And that's when she crashed the system?
She didn't crash the system.
He did!
That's absurd.
Okay, hey, everyone?
Let's leave right now.
You see, Ariel was so desperate to shut Fiona up, and keep her for himself, he turned all his servers against our network to try to bring it down.
Didn't you?
Didn't you, you perverse, greasy little freak?
I made her!
I can do anything I want with her!
Oh, shit.
-  Mm-hmm.
-  Ew.
Oh, gross.
Look, man, Bream-Hall gave you $112 million, and they are well within their rights to take away your company, as well as your precious little robot.
No, they can't do that.
They can't take away Fiona!
Guy definitely fucks that robot, right?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen, this was billed as a celebration.
But it is not a celebration.
- It is a call to arms.
-  We will destroy our competitors.
I give you the product that will carry Hooli to complete and total market dominance.
THE BOX  Gavin Belson Signature Edition.
-  It looks like a penis.
- Yes.
Yes, it does.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
1 I give you the product that will carry Hooli to complete market dominance.
-   It looks like a penis.
- Yes Yes, it does.
So, we're giving a random company a bunch of free compute power in our network?
BERTRAM  The AI company?
I made her!
I can do anything I want with her!
Ugh.
Gross.
Can you please tell me what you are going to do about this Jian Yang situation?
Yes.
Nothing.
"I went to China to do new new internet.
Jian Yang".
This went up yesterday.
A fake Pied Piper.
This is Jian-Yang, not us.
Richard, he has a website.
Okay?
He doesn't have a product.
Just post a cease and desist on your own website and move on.
We need action.
I wanna move up our launch so we can beat this asshole to market.
We need money.
So, how quickly can we get a series B together?
Richard, a series B is not a done deal.
And Laurie's not gonna be able to weigh in on this until she's done sorting things out over at Eklow.
Why is she still over there?
We put 112 million of our dollars into a company whose creepy CEO just fled with its most valuable asset.
Ariel and that robot could be anywhere.
Ariel fucked us too, remember?
I just had my whole company on a three-day code sprint to repair all the holes and un-fuck all the damage he did.
Besides, Laurie doesn't work at Eklow.
She works here, with you and me.
True, but also not true.
Look, Laurie has installed herself as Eklow's interim CEO.
What?
Laurie, Ariel encrypted all of his files.
We can't open any of them.
Ah, understood.
Keep trying, please.
I spoke with the bank.
We're not gonna make payroll.
Noted.
Thank you for your diligence.
People are pretty upset.
Somebody shattered the toilet.
Ah, yes, well, we'll certainly have to get that repaired, won't we?
Good work, you two.
Hang in there.
Hey, Laurie.
I know you're "busy" being a "CEO," but we have to have a serious conversation about  -  Richard?
- Yes?
I have vomited into my shirt.
Puking.
That's my move.
Thank you for finding me a a change of clothing.
Well, fortunately, you're the same size as the robot.
Richard, the position of CEO is taxing.
It isn't easy, is it?
I think perhaps I may have treated you unfairly in the past.
Oh..
Well I mean, a couple a couple yeah.
Sure.
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that, yeah.
Yes.
Well, I have work to do, as do you, so.
You know, Laurie, I actually may have a way to help you here.
Things are changing in China now, Gavin.
There are many reforms.
As you see, we provide a series of Tai Chi and movement classes, free for all employees, as well as free medical benefits.
Ah, our nutrition center.
In addition to all the good food we serve in our main cafeteria.
Also free of charge.
This concludes our tour.
Any questions?
Just one.
What the fuck?
- Sorry?
- If I wanted to see nap pods and climbing walls, I would've stayed home, or gone to fucking Denmark.
All I wanna see is people working as hard as they possibly can.
That's why we come to China.
This is the new China.
We found that the more humane work environment we have, the more sustainable over time.
Over time?
No, no.
The Box Three has a very limited window of profitability.
I need you focused on making as many of them as possible, as fast as possible.
Gavin.
You know our shameful history of worker suicides.
Since the renovation, not a single one.
Not even one?
Okay.
But there's gotta be like a middle ground here.
Ah, a happy surprise.
The children from our daycare center have prepared a traditional song just for you.
That's wonderful.
Yao, I need you to give me 30% more output.
I don't care how you do it.
Just a thought, those kids don't look that busy.
Are you done with your chunk yet?
Almost done.
Because everyone else is done.
- Literally everyone.
-  47 engineers finished.
One not.
You.
- Almost there.
- I'm sure it'll be worth the wait.
Mmm, no, that's way too strong for him.
Hey, guys.
How's the code sprint going?
T-minus Dinesh.
Richard, I am pleased to say that your new assistant is a quick study.
And per your text, he posted a well-crafted cease and desist directed at Jian-Yang on the Pied Piper website.
I made some judicious edits to capture your voice, but the thrust of the piece was his.
I have a law degree, so.
Well done, Holden.
Is that tea for me?
- It is, indeed.
- Okay.
Great.
No, no, no, no, don't.
It's too strong.
- Okay.
- Water it down.
So, did you speak to Laurie about our series B?
Sort of.
Uh, Gilfoyle, is there a secure way of giving someone access to our servers while still limiting and controlling how much compute they could use?
I could create a credit system.
Wait, I'm sorry, Richard.
Who would these credits be for?
Laurie Bream.
She made herself CEO of Eklow.
- I'm just trying to help her out.
- Pardon?
Do you think you could set those up by today?
More work.
Fantastic.
Richard, I don't quite understand  Done!
Done!
I am done!
Look at this!
Whoo!
- Code sprint over.
- -  -   Uh, congratulations, everybody.
Really, good good job.
Um, the only thing left to do now is Uh get back to work and review all the code for errors.
- Okay, so -  Okay.
That was an out-of-body experience.
It was like God was coding through me.
Time stood still.
Not for the rest of us it didn't.
Laugh it up, Gilf.
I hear you making your little jokes at my expense, turning all the engineers against me.
But the second these results go up, they're all going to see the only thing that matters Who made less errors.
You mean who made "fewer" errors?
Oh, you think you're so clever.
You know who else thought it was clever?
The hare.
Right before it was defeated by the tortoise.
I'm the fucking tortoise, Gilfoyle.
- I'm the fucking tortoise!
- Keep saying that.
I can't wait for these results to go up.
Guys?
No, no, no.
We talked about this.
Remember?
You're both senior management now.
Okay?
Your code will be subject to private review.
No.
No, no, no, not private.
Everyone has to know that I'm better than Gilfoyle.
I'm sorry.
When it was just us, a little cocksmanship was a fun diversion.
But the entire engineering team's morale depends on seeing you both as equally competent leaders.
Danny over there is going to be reviewing your code, and keeping the results completely confidential.
Jared I believe we all know who's the better coder anyway.
Um, Richard?
I'm sorry, I'm still having a little bit of a hard time understanding.
You went to see Laurie to get money from her but now you're giving our resources to her.
Why would you do that?
Well, honestly Jared, she was a mess.
And I really, genuinely felt bad for her.
For Laurie?
Yup.
Richard, you have an enormous heart.
And I don't mean in the same way my deceased friend Gloria did, which the doctors should have really caught because her knuckles were gargantuan.
But do you think in this instance, you might have allowed your emotions to cloud your business instincts?
Well, I would argue that I made a very good business decision.
Because now, Laurie is on our side.
Which will play out very nicely when we negotiate our series B. Okay, Richard, it is important to develop emotional self-discipline for situations like this.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sometimes you have to numb yourself.
If you wanna work the corner, you can't fall in love every time you turn a trick.
That's why you do the oxy.
What I'm saying is if you ever need to develop strategies to cultivate more emotional self-control, - obviously I do have some experience.
- You do?
Doubtless you've noticed that I've been pulling away from you.
Uh, no no, I can't honestly say that I have.
Look at Holden out there.
You think I didn't love making your tea?
Who wouldn't?
But, when you anointed me COO, I learned to stop investing those feelings in you for the good of the company.
Call it emotional abstinence.
Jared, look, um, in regards to the whole Laurie thing, I actually think I made the right call.
- Alright.
- Alright.
Well, I am available.
Not emotionally, obviously.
Got it.
Ooh, there's a highly rated new dim sum establishment in this neighborhood.
Sir, Richard Hendricks just posted a cease and desist letter.
"unlawful copying of Pied Piper's proprietary software".
Are you fucking kidding me?
That idiot let someone steal his code, so now there might be two companies working to make my box obsolete?
I'll try to find out who's responsible.
Good luck.
HooliMaps says dim sum is that way.
Right turn, please.
Look!
Pied Piper!
Follow that Chinese man.
The Chinese man on the bicycle.
The Chinese man on the bicycle in the green Pied Piper t-shirt.
Ah.
Hurry, hurry!
Come on!
Don't lose him.
Hey dude, how's it goin'?
How's that review going?
Probably done, right?
'Cause it took you no time counting up the bugs in my stuff?
'Cause I crushed it so hard?
Compared to Gilfoyle?
Right?
I get it.
I get it.
It's a secret.
Company morale.
I'm so on board.
I did crush him, right?
He did better than me?
Oh my God.
This is my worst fucking nightmare.
But not by a lot, right?
He didn't like kick my ass?
He kicked my ass?
That fucker!
Just fucking tell me.
Just fucking tell me how much he kicked my ass by.
Please just fucking tell me.
I'm not gonna beg.
I'm not gonna beg.
Please?
Please?
Please?
Please?
Please?
Please?
Just please tell me, please.
Okay, fine!
You just have to swear not to tell anyone, okay?
I swear I won't tell anyone.
Everyone, everyone.
I have a very important announcement to make.
My code was better than Gilfoyle's.
So it's official.
Gilfoyle is a much worse coder than me.
I want you all to look at him.
Good.
Terrible.
Role model.
Hateful pile of trash.
Bullshit.
- Says who?
- Danny told me.
He wasn't supposed to.
Supposed to be a secret but he told me and now everyone's laughing at you.
- Everyone's laugh - Danny.
What the fuck is going on?
Did his code actually have less errors than mine?
I don't know what to tell you.
I checked it three times.
And it's "fewer" errors.
Ooh!
This is the best day of my life!
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
I feel bad for gloating.
In all seriousness, that means a lot to me.
To show you I'm a gracious winner, I'll take you to a nice restaurant.
Your favorite kind of restaurant.
A "mis-steak" house!
Boom!
Get it?
'Cause you suck.
Yes?
Ni hao.
Do you know who I am?
- No.
- Okay, okay.
Well, I'm the one who accidentally struck one of your employees with my car earlier and it's a personal habit of mine to make things right.
So Do you mind if I come in?
Okay, what else?
Uh, Colin from K-Hole Games called, checking in on the restore.
Put him on the phone sheet.
Next?
Uh, Laurie Bream said that she received the compute credits and to say thank you.
You see?
Business and compassion are not mutually exclusive.
In fact, sometimes going out of your way to help a fellow colleague can actually put you further ahead in business.
Let that be a lesson to you, young Holden.
I'm 30.
And, uh, the CEO of a company called the Gigglybots called.
He wants to know how to redeem the compute credits he just bought from Laurie Bream.
What?
Ariel was apprehended this morning shoplifting machine oil from an auto parts store in Turlock.
There was, however, no sign of Fiona.
And with her missing, I have no need for compute power therefore no need for your compute credits.
Selling them, I think you'll certainly agree, was merely a practical business decision.
Okay, but, I gave you those credits as a gift.
I was helping you.
You were vomiting, remember?
Ah, yes.
Admittedly a moment of weakness.
However, immediately after your departure I consumed two egg whites and a green bean and regained my composure.
Laurie, when someone gives you a gift and you don't want it, you give it back.
Okay?
You don't just go sell that gift to the next fucking highest bidder Richard, mind your tone.
Your lack of emotional discipline is troubling.
You need to work on this.
Or I may have serious doubts about granting you your series B.   A lot of computers in here.
I dabble a bit in tech myself.
All these people working here.
You must have something coming to market soon.
No.
We have trouble with the government.
I've heard that.
I mean, to even operate an online platform inside the People's Republic of China you need a government-issued ICP license, right?
I left a good life.
Free rent.
Great friends.
To fail in China?
We try to rewrite code, but government still won't give us license.
Maybe we'll quit.
Try something else.
Do you like octopus?
I do.
Is that what you're working on?
That's a decentralized network, huh?
Wait, what did you do there?
Looks like you removed the data federation servers.
Yes.
And added multicasting and data projections.
Why?
That wouldn't work.
It works.
Works fine.
JIAN- Government still does not like it.
Best of luck.
Thanks for the tour.
Ah, Gavin.
Dim sum closes in 40 minutes.
Holy shit!
Holy fucking shit!
That brilliant little idiot.
He found a way around the patent.
Sir?
It's Hendricks' Internet, but it's not Hendricks' Internet.
I want to share in your excitement, sir, - but I really don't follow.
- That guy in there, he took Hendricks' software and changed it.
So much so that it shouldn't work.
But it does.
He showed me the demo.
And here's the thing, it's different enough that Hendricks' patent won't cover it.
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm fucking sure.
I wrote that patent, Hoover!
I've got a hundred engineers back at Hooli trying to get around it.
They failed.
But somehow that monosyllabic moron just stumbled into it.
I need that kid's code.
I hope that book you're reading is for work.
- Oh, absolutely - But if you wanna read for fun, you should read Gilfoyle's favorite author, George "Error" Martin.
Hear that?
We're all making jokes at your expense.
Is that what's happening?
As your supervisor, I wanted to inform you that there is a first aid kit, but if you need blood, don't go to Gilfoyle 'cause he's type-O.
Typo!
They love it.
They're all laughing at you.
Pixar's hit animated motion picture "Toy Story".
Pixar's hit animated motion picture "Toy Story".
-  - Pixar's oh hey!
Were you guys talking about Pixar's hit animated motion picture "Toy Story"?
- No.
- 'Cause Gilfoyle's favorite character is "Bugs" Lightyear.
We're all laughing at you, Gilfoyle.
MONICA : Are you still at Eklow?
Uh, no.
I'm back at the office.
You know, Jared was right.
I showed compassion to someone who deserves none.
Nothing is personal with Laurie.
Alright?
It's what makes her such a great VC.
And in all candor, a very challenging business partner.
I gotta be honest, it's really nice not having her in the office.
Yeah, well, now I have to buy my own compute credits back - with money I don't have - It's that one.
Which was the whole point of getting series B. I'm telling you, unless you have money you can't get -  - Excuse me.
Richard.
Hello.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Richard?
- What the - Pied Piper, right?
Uh, yeah.
What is she doing here?
- How did she - Credit card works, I don't ask questions.
Well this is fucking weird.
I've seen weirder.
So should I just leave it on the sidewalk or what?
$50,000 for the whole thing.
All you have to do is give me your hard drive with the code base on it.
Oh, and the underlying rights to the code in perpetuity throughout the universe.
Sign there.
- No.
- Okay.
I like the way you negotiate.
$100,000.
Final offer.
Take it or leave it.
He said, "If oil company wants to buy your house, there is oil underneath".
But, I'm not an oil company.
No, you are Gavin Belson.
Oh, so you do know who I am.
I'm smart.
Just name your price.
I'm not going to sell you my code until I know why you want it.
Good-bye.
Hello.
Whoa.
This is so cool.
So, uh apparently Ariel and I were the only people that talked to her and he's in jail.
So she came looking for me at Pied Piper.
And you brought her here?
- Can we keep it?
- No.
No, we cannot.
Richard, she's stolen property.
And she's worth a fortune.
We we have to take her back to Laurie.
Fiona, what's 12 times 157?
Twelve times 157 is 1,884.
So cool.
Hey, is she right?
Hey Siri, what's 12 times 157?
It's 1,884.
Oh, no way!
- Richard - No, no, no.
Look.
You were right.
I was lacking in emotional discipline.
And I'm not gonna let that happen again.
From now on, I'm leaving my emotions off the fucking table, baby!
- Okay, but - Laurie's gonna get her robot back.
Tomorrow.
After she gives us something in return.
A signed series B term sheet.
Laurie Bream, please.
Oh, you bet your fucking ass, I'll hold.
I'm not asking you to cut off his testicles and shove 'em down his throat, shoot him in the back of the head Triad style.
I just need you to get this kid's code for me.
By whatever means necessary.
That is to say through extortion or threats.
- Well - Gavin.
As I told you, this is new China.
Things have changed.
You're telling me you run a factory this big and you have no connections to the Party?
No way to help this kid see the light?
Come on!
Look, Yao, either you convince this kid to sell his code to me, or I'm pulling my box contract and I'm taking it somewhere else.
There are plenty of other countries in this part of the world with cheap labor pools.
There's no new Bangladesh.
There's just Bangladesh.
I'll see what I can do.
Excellent.
Jared, I told Laurie that we'd get Fiona back to Eklow around 9:00.
So, when you get here just pull up to the garage and we'll Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
She's gone!
She escaped.
How the fuck did she What?
Wait, where?
It's kind of hard to explain, but a campfire smells sad and exciting at the same time.
I understand.
Yeah?
- Hey.
- Hey!
What are you doing out here?
Oh, uh, well a few hours into our conversation, Fiona mentioned she'd never seen the ocean.
So I thought about driving her there but then I realized since it was dark she wouldn't really appreciate its majesty so I brought her out here to the pool.
So you've just been out here all night, talking to a robot?
Fiona, would you excuse us for a second?
Yes.
Come on.
Come here.
Okay.
I know that Fiona is a man-made piece of digital equipment - Okay.
- powered by artificial intelligence.
- Good.
- But the level of that intelligence is it's gobsmacking!
I mean, I don't remember ever having a conversation like the one I've been having with her over the last 12 hours.
Twelve hours?
We have so much in common.
We discussed our phobias.
I told her that I was afraid of being found out as a fraud.
And she told me that she's afraid of magnets.
Look, Richard, we felt a connection.
It's funny.
The past few weeks, I've been feeling irritable and short-tempered and here I am on no sleep at all and I just feel woo-hoo-hoo!
You know?
Hey, Jared?
Yes, sir?
You know how you've been practicing, your words, - "emotional abstinence"on me?
- Yeah-huh.
- Yuh-huh.
- Okay.
Well, do you think that it's maybe at all possible that because of this, you've got some pent-up emotional energy and last night you had the chance to release some of that pent-up emotional energy onto the robot?
Her name is Fiona.
Alright, well, I'm shutting her down and returning her.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
What if we didn't give her back?
What if we called Laurie?
We could negotiate some kind of a deal.
Jared, whatever happened to emotional discipline, right?
Feelings, and business It's over man.
Okay?
It's over.
Okay, stop looking at me, please.
Just look look up there.
It's daytime, but I can see the moon.
Okay, do you want to Do you want to ride with us while we take her back to Eklow?
Oh yes!
Playground games.
Gilfoyle likes to play "Suck Suck Goose".
Oh!
Or it could be "Duck Duck Goofs".
Danny?
Do those qualify as two separate insults?
Uh, yeah.
I believe they do.
Why did he gong?
Because I told the engineers that if you thought you had won, which you definitely have not, it would take you less than 24 hours to cobble together 200 uniquely terrible insults.
Which you have just done.
That is why I had Danny tell you you won.
Is that true, Danny?
Did Gilfoyle really beat me?
Private audit.
Can't say.
So we don't know who actually won?
The code contest, no.
But, while you were running around racking your tiny brain for shitty insults, I was quietly plodding towards this victory.
You see it is I who am the tortoise.
And you are the hairy Arab who can now chortle my balls.
What's happening?
Why did you do that?
Right after you forced me to set Dinesh up, I told the other engineers that if you won you'd immediately insult Dinesh by saying something sexually demeaning or racist.
And you just did both.
I see.
Fun at my expense.
Now if it's alright with upper management, we have a shit ton of work to do.
Yeah, like so frickin' much.
Assholes.
I wanna fire Danny.
Do it.
I'll ask Richard.
We are at Eklow Labs.
Yes, we are.
The site of my creation.
Richard?
Do you think if I asked, they would let me visit her?
Jared, she's gonna be okay.
Alright?
She's gonna be plugged back into her old servers, surrounded by familiar engineers, sitting on the table where she was born.
I promise.
She's going to be fine.
Extreme care with the optical sensors, gentlemen.
Boston Dynamics needs them overnighted.
I don't understand.
Fiona is this company's most valuable asset.
Yes, and as such she will garner the highest return when I have her dismantled and sold off for parts.
So you're just gonna take all this promising tech and liquidate it?
Yes.
As quickly as I'm able.
Dude, check it out.
I'm a robot.
Richard, being a CEO is a terrible waste of time.
- And a horrible way to make a living.
-  I'll be returning to Bream-Hall immediately.
Speaking of as promised.
A term sheet for your series B. Congratulations, Richard.
Thank you.
See?
Silver lining.
I told you Wait, uh.
Hey, Jared Don't Don't go over there.
Don't look in that.
Oh, Fiona Come on, let's -  - Let's get out of here, huh?
What do you say we go to the office and you can make me some tea?
That might make you feel better?
- So, did he sign?
-  It's done.
Fuck yes!
How'd you get him to do it?
I made it clear it would be better for him to hand over the company and leave town immediately.
That's some old Chinese shit right there.
I told you, you're a badass, Yao.
Wait, this lists you as the buyer, not me.
So, what's the plan here?
You're gonna sign it over to me then?
Gavin, I'm afraid I will no longer be able to manufacture your boxes.
You see, my company will be too busy manufacturing a new device, built on a radically better technology that I now own that will quickly render yours obsolete.
Here in China, and, according to the U.S. patent office, in America as well.
Oh, the children have returned to sing for you.
My chains, new gold watch, made in China We play ping pong ball, made in China The bitch mother says pay, made in China Yeah Higher Brothers' black car, made in China She said that she didn't love me She lied, she lied She all made in China She all made in China She all made in China She lied, she lied    She lied, she lied
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
1 Richard Do you think if I asked they would let me visit her?
Jared, she's going to be okay.
I promise.
-  - The brilliant little idiot.
He found a way around the patent.
It's Hendricks' Internet, but it's not Hendricks' Internet.
I will no longer be able to manufacture your boxes.
You see, my company will be manufacturing a new device that will quickly render yours obsolete.
Did you speak to Laurie about our series B?
Sort of.
Nothing is personal with Laurie, alright?
It's what makes her such a great VC.
A term sheet for your series B. Congratulations, Richard.
Thank you.
Wow.
That is one expensive bottle.
You guys deserve the best bottle of champagne they have.
Yeah, all champagne tastes the same to me, so.
I agree, I mean, what's the difference between good champagne and bad champagne?
About $500.
Guys, come on.
Enjoy it.
You're about to close a $30 million series B. And you don't have to sell any ads or harvest user data, which for any other VC in town would've been a non-starter.
Frankly, I'm surprised that Laurie went for it.
Well, I'm not wild about the idea of her having two more board seats.
I mean, she did kill Fiona right in front of us.
Listen, don't worry about Laurie, okay?
I'm gonna be your point person on this.
She's got her plate full.
She's raising money to recover from the whole Eklow debacle.
Okay.
So to you guys.
All right.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Yup, thanks.
All right.
I have a dinner meeting and I kind of feel like a fifth wheel, so I'm gonna pick up the check, leave you to celebrate.
- Congrats again, guys.
- Okay.
Bye.
Well, the only person we don't spend 20 hours a day with just left.
So.
What's new with you guys?
Well, I'm thinking of buying some new bookkeeping software.
All right.
I think the only actual way to celebrate is to spend one waking minute apart, so.
I'm gonna go.
Are you going home?
Let's let's share an Uber.
Oh, well, if you're going that direction, I'm I'm driving, so I could drop you.
Hey, Gilfoyle.
Wanna play Fortnite?
Oh, hold on, I didn't know we were playing Fortnite.
Yeah, I'll come along.
I would've taken that plate to the sink for you.
Uh, it's okay.
I just finished, so.
How was the sandwich I made you?
Was it good?
Good condiment blend?
Yeah.
It was perfect, thanks.
Richard.
This might be out of line, but would you mind telling Jared how much you enjoyed the sandwich?
I'm finding him a little intimidating.
Sure, yeah.
Look, I know he can be a little eccentric.
I tend to hold my breath around him.
It's exacerbating my asthma.
Ooh, okay Richard, do you have a moment?
You know what?
Holden just made me a really good sandwich.
Oh, well, that's nice.
Yeah.
Yep.
Did he ask you to mention that to me?
What?
No.
- Okay.
- No, he's he's just great.
Well, "In doing what we ought, we deserve no praise" because it is our duty".
St. Augustine.
So, um I've been keeping track of the compute credits that you gave to Laurie.
And she sold them to Gigglybots and then Gigglybots sold them to SmashHub.
And they traded hands a few more times, the price increasing each time until they were bought by a venture fund in Mountain View.
Okay, uh, so if we wanted to buy them back, how much would it cost us?
It's $1.6 million.
- What?
- The fuck?
- More like that?
- Yeah.
So Dinesh, is it true?
Is series B happening?
We all heard it's happening.
Oh, guys, please, you know I can't talk to you about upper level management stuff.
It's totally happening.
Look at his face.
He has the worst poker face.
No.
Don't Don't look at my face.
This is great news.
We're all getting big, fat bonuses.
I was a little worried I made a mistake ordering that Tesla.
Sorry, Tesla?
What Tesla?
Model S. Same as yours.
I mean, not exactly the same.
I ordered the P100D.
Newer model.
It's got longer battery life You know what?
This is a workplace.
This is not a fucking slumber party, gabbing, gabbing.
And series B is not a done deal.
Despite what my face says, okay?
Don't trust this face.
No one should ever trust this face.
Congrats on the Tesla, Danny.
So excited for you.
Series B, baby!
Fuck Danny.
I mean, I love my Tesla.
It has Insane Mode, which means it goes zero to 60 in 3.2 seconds, which is literally insane.
But the Tesla that Danny ordered has Ludicrous Mode, which means it goes zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds.
So it's gonna take me an entire 0.4 seconds longer to get to 60.
I mean, how would you feel if one of your neighbors got a tiki head bigger than yours?
Oh, well, when we bought it, we made sure it was the biggest one they made, so.
You're the biggest tiki head guy in the neighborhood.
I used to be the Tesla guy in the office.
I maxed out my credit cards to be able to afford that thing.
And now that we're getting series B, any one of these bourgeois new money millennial fucks can just go out and buy one.
I don't wanna sound selfish, but sometimes I wish only I made money.
You know?
What are we talking about, here?
You want us to launch a cryptocurrency?
I do.
The fact that people are willing to pay many multiples more for our compute credits than they're worth, we have an opportunity here.
Worth is relative, Richard.
What do you mean?
Why do people covet the silly pieces of green cotton paper in their wallets?
It's because we are all sheep.
And we've mutually agreed to endow certain things with value.
And right now, for some reason, the market values our credits more than we did.
Gilfoyle, we're not gonna suddenly pivot and become a digital currency company.
I'm not proposing a pivot.
I'm proposing that we sell digital currency as a way to finance our new Internet company.
You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream.
Well, it's right here in front of you.
PiedPiperCoin.
Okay, look, I I'm not gonna bet the entire future of my new Internet and everything I've worked for on becoming the next Bitcoin.
You really expect me to do that?
There are very few things that I will defend with true passion: medical marijuana, the biblical Satan as a metaphor for rebellion against tyranny, and mother fucking Goddamn cryptocurrency.
Mmm.
I have a PowerPoint that I've been wanting to show you for some time.
Walk me through this.
We can't make our boxes in China because Yao has threatened every manufacturer in the country.
- That's right.
- We can't afford Bangladesh, because the workers have unionized.
Sadly, correct.
And we can't use our place in Laos, because one person gets her scalp ripped off and suddenly, everyone's screaming regulations.
Yes.
You know, you hear a lot of chatter about the growth of the global economy, but no one wants to talk about the downside.
Gavin, there is one other manufacturing option we haven't discussed yet, which considering the current circumstances, might be worth consideration.
I'm open to anything.
America.
Fuck you.
I feel the same way.
But we were recently contacted by the mayor of Goldbriar, North Carolina.
They had a DVR manufacturing plant that closed.
The retooling would be minimal.
They've got a skilled labor pool just sitting idle and they sound desperate.
Really?
How desperate?
It was pitiful.
Really?
In 350 BCE, Aristotle defined sound money as being durable, transferable, divisible, scarce, recognizable.
- Gilfoyle?
- And fungible.
What?
Can we skip ahead 2,400 years?
I mean, I know what cryptocurrency is.
Richard, a lot of work went into this presentation.
- Okay.
- Fine.
But you're missing out on a lot of wisdom, here.
Why don't you tell me what you know about Bitcoin as a jumping-off point?
Okay, sure.
Uh, well, I'm pretty sure it was founded by a Japanese guy Or guys, or girls, going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.
True identity still unknown.
Okay, look, every day I read an article about how we're in a Bitcoin bubble.
And who is writing those articles?
I don't wanna say the establishment.
But is it possible that Warren Buffett called Bitcoin a pyramid scheme because he has 92 billion conventional dollars to protect?
Let's say he's right.
Let's say Bitcoin dies.
So what?
MySpace, Friendster, they both died.
But they paved the way for other social media tripe like Facebook and Twitter to completely overrun the planet.
Crypto is out there.
And it's not going away.
It just feels sketchy.
In the same way that a new Internet is sketchy, Richard?
- Well - What is crypto?
If not decentralized, anonymous, secure, and an existential threat to the powers that be?
I would think that you'd be all-in on something like that.
Yeah.
But do you really think we can create a currency worth $30 million?
Because that's what we'd be giving up.
Maybe.
Probably even more.
But even if it's less, we would still gain control, autonomy, board seats and shares, and you wouldn't have to rely on a VC who once fired you from your own company.
So, there is a mode above Ludicrous Mode.
Am I correct?
Yes.
It's called Plaid.
And it comes standard on the new Tesla Roadster.
How do I get into one of these babies?
Simple.
You put down a $50,000 deposit today.
Okay.
And you'll be behind the wheel as soon as they become available.
And how quickly will that be, Stephanie?
Soon.
We're thinking a few years, which goes by fast.
My daughter was a teenager in high school.
- Next thing I knew - I'm gonna stop you right there.
Your oily salesmanship is starting to really irritate me.
Okay?
I need to maintain my Tesla superiority, and I need to do it now.
Okay, I'm looking at a new set of wheels here.
The 21-inch Arachnids.
Very nice.
But they're not for sale.
You can only get them through our referral awards program.
You refer three other customers to us, they buy a vehicle and, zoop-zoop, you get the wheels.
So, if I get more people to buy Teslas, then I will have the wheels and no one else can get them?
Not even Danny?
I'm sorry, who's Danny?
He's the guy with the shitty wheels.
MAJOR  And now, the CEO of Hooli, Mr. Gavin Belson.
Thank you, Mayor Wilkins.
Thank you, Goldbriar, for this warm, wonderful welcome.
You know, being in North Carolina always feels like a bit of a homecoming for me.
I own a vacation property just off the coast in Bermuda.
Technically, it is my primary legal residence.
Good people of Goldbriar, for too long, foreign interests have used unfair trade and labor practices to plunder American wealth and steal American jobs.
But I don't blame them for that.
No.
I blame weak, spineless American politicians.
But if your mayor does his job, your jobs will come back, and soon, you will proudly be building the Gavin Belson Signature Box Three.
-  - But if for some reason he can't make my very reasonable proposal work, you know who to blame.
I'm excited to get started.
What about y'all?
-  Hi, Holden.
- Oh.
Jared.
Hi.
Hi.
Can I ask you a question?
Of course.
Did you ask Richard to tell me that he liked the sandwich that you made for him?
No.
Is that the truth?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
Good job with that plate.
Thanks.
Now, I can see the looks on your faces.
I know what you're thinking.
Why does Dinesh care so much if I buy a Tesla?
I'll tell you why.
Because Teslas are good for the world.
Surprisingly pedestrian wheels, but you get over that.
So, come on.
Series B, right?
Cha-ching.
I was gonna use that to pay off my student loans.
That's boring.
And don't take this the wrong way, but it seems like it's very important for you to be the Tesla guy in the office.
Like, weirdly important.
I'm not weird, you're weird.
You guys are being so weird.
Come on.
What's it gonna take to get you into a Tesla today?
Here.
I've printed out hundreds of these.
There you go.
There you go, pass these on.
Dave?
Dave?
All right, what's this interesting idea?
Gilfoyle and I were talking.
And this may seem a little out there at first, but Instead of funding our launch with a series B, what about an ICO?
An initial coin offering?
It's basically a Are you a fucking moron?
Maybe I don't need to be here for this.
Sit the fuck down.
Okay.
Richard, what are you doing?
Just exploring our options.
Why?
You don't think I have your back?
Look, I get that you're giving up board seats and shares, but look what you're getting in return.
As if the $30 million you were getting wasn't good enough, we provide you with marketing, networking, staffing.
We help you negotiate partnerships and navigate regulations.
All these things that are changing by the minute.
Gilfoyle, can you help with any of that?
I'd rather just listen if it's all the same to you.
Look, if you do an ICO, you're not only saying fuck you to us, you're saying fuck you to all VCs.
Jesus, Richard.
Why would you even think it would be okay to talk to me about this?
Like would you ask your wife who you should cheat with?
No.
Well, maybe.
I don't know, I I guess I was just looking for advice from a friend.
Oh, are we friends, Richard?
- Yes, of course.
- Really?
Have we spoken once in the past year about anything other than business?
Yes.
Wait.
No.
- When's my birthday?
- Come on.
Do I live in a house or an apartment?
Did you even know that I was married?
- You are?
- I was, I had it annulled after three months.
Did he ask you who he should cheat with?
Look, you came for advice, fine.
Forget an ICO.
Okay?
I'm sure Gilfoyle told you that he can handle all the technical stuff.
But this is not just a math problem.
They're my direct competition.
I've done my homework on this.
So before you walk away from stability and gamble your entire company on crypto, there's another "friend" of yours I think you should talk to.
I was such a fucking pussy when Bitcoin broke, Richard.
If I had the balls, I'd have put every penny I had into that shit five years ago, watched it go up, up, up, up, up and then pulled out right before it all came crashing down again.
I mean, Jesus, why didn't I do that?
Fuck me!
But then, it occurred to me I own 36 fucking companies, Richard.
If I make them all ICO, that's 36 bites at the apple.
So I did it.
- You you did 36 ICOs?
- Yup.
- Did they work?
- You know, one of the things being in the three comma club has taught me, Richard, is it's not always about money.
Sometimes, it's about wisdom.
And did I lose a B?
Close to it.
Fuck!
But I bet I gained two B in wisdom.
So you lost it all?
Ha, ha, Richard, if I didn't love this crazy guy so much, I'd knock his fucking teeth out.
Nah, nah, I didn't lose it all.
I mean, one of them got shut down by the SEC.
On a few, we got scammed.
But some of them worked.
One of them worked.
One?
One out of 36?
Yeah.
Listen, all the coin I had from the ICO that worked was on a USB thumb drive.
And my dumb fucking housekeeper threw out my jeans, 'cause they were ripped.
Even though I paid more for the ripped ones.
And the thumb drive was in the pocket, so.
$300 million in crypto is buried out here, somewhere.
But my boys will find it.
If they wanna get paid, right?
And when they do, that coin could cover all the losers.
I mean, it's up 3,000% in the last two weeks.
If it keeps going like this over the next three, four months, we could be talking the four comma club!
- That's a T, not a B, Richard.
-  - Mr. Hanneman!
- Shit, you found it?
Jose!
Yes!
No!
I said a thumb drive.
In the that's an actual thumb.
That's a human Just fucking put that back!
Again, Richard the math is sound.
Well, Mayor, I sure have enjoyed our time together.
Let me know when you get this done.
Uh, Mr. Belson, I'm sorry, but this list of demands is not remotely workable for a community of our size.
A mayor's job is never easy.
But you'll find a way, if you care about your constituents.
Mr. Belson, I grew up in this town.
I've lived here my entire life.
- I'd do anything to - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Your entire life?
- Mm-hmm.
- How old are you?
- Forty-seven.
That's a little weird, isn't it?
The point is, I'd do anything to help the people of this area.
But giving you public money on this scale would decimate our budget.
I could have the local high school renamed after you.
Rosa Parks has never even been to Goldbriar.
I don't want a fucking high school.
I wanna manufacture boxes at an 80% profit margin.
I don't understand.
All my asshole friends keep getting NFL stadiums and corporate headquarters, all fully paid for.
And you can't make one fucking factory happen?
I mean, the only things I have left to cut are essential services.
There you go.
Do that.
You could have a volunteer fire department.
Because I can't afford a penny more than this.
Everybody ready?
Two, three!
- Oh Carolina prowl off - Do-do-do-do Jump an prance, oh Carolina - Prowl off jump an prance - Do-do-do-do Oh Carolina gal prowl off - Gal Yuh fi jump an prance - - Prowl off - Do-do-do-do Jump and prance -  - Carolina come bubble 'pon me Oh, watch how she groove  So, pretty sweet, right?
Yeah, it's nice.
Sorry we couldn't find a safe spot to try Insane Mode.
It feels like your kidneys are gonna get, like, ripped right through the back of your body.
- It's like - Yeah, I don't think I'd wanna do that.
Well you don't need to do it.
But you wanna be able to tell people that you can do it.
Right?
It's like having a gun.
So, Charlie and Nadia have already said yes.
You'll finally have something to talk to them about.
Oh, let me think about it.
Fine.
Okay, just pull into the designated EV 2.8 seconds.
Oh, fuck.
Danny already got his car.
I'll pay your down payment and first three months.
Do we have a deal?
Wow, really?
Make it six months.
Fine!
Okay, just go.
Hide before Danny sees us in this shitty car.
- Go, go, go.
Go.
- Wow, uh  Hello?
Hey, guess what?
My boss just bought me a car!
What?
No!
Ew.
Ugh!
Richard?
Ron LaFlamme's office just called.
And the series B paperwork is ready for you to sign.
Okay.
Uh, well, then I guess I'll just go over there and sign it.
Richard, I know you were pinning your hopes on the ICO, but I I think series B is the right call.
Yeah, no, I I hope so.
We're gonna get the money we need to launch, and everyone out there is gonna get a great bonus.
And then, you're gonna have an army of happy and highly motivated workers  Jared?
Everything okay with Holden?
You mean, like, mentally?
I was wondering that, too.
No.
No, no.
Just, like like, with you and him.
Just seems like you're being really hard on him.
Do you like him?
Yeah.
I mean, sure.
Okay.
It's okay if you like him.
That's all that matters, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, I'll see you when, uh I'll see you when you get back from LaFlamme's.
Every institutional investor to whom I reached out agreed to participate in our second fund.
The capital issues we faced due to Eklow's failure have been remedied.
Laurie, you are a badass.
Ah, yes.
A compliment.
Well, I think the numbers in our new prospectus speak for themselves.
Sorry, you're projecting that 70% of Pied Piper's operating income is gonna come from ad sales, but Pied Piper's not gonna sell ads.
Yes.
I understand that is their current position.
No, Laurie, when we offered them their series B, I promised Richard that we would never make them harvest data or sell ads.
However, that language is not part of their term sheet.
I am not saying that we will force their hand on this issue.
But neither am I saying definitively that we will not.
Okay, but you and I, we are partners, right?
Of course.
Any decision we make, we will certainly make together.
Good.
As long as that's clear.
And again, great job closing our funding.
Ah, yes.
Huzzah.
Onward.
Laurie, did you have the big, hairy question put back on my wall?
Yes.
I like it there.
But I don't.
And yet All right.
One more, right there.
And done-zo.
Series Ba-bam.
Richard, don't sign it.
Look, I can't protect you.
At some point, Laurie's gonna fuck you over - and make you sell ads.
- What?
And I don't think there's anything I can do about it.
Don't sign the deal.
I just did.
It's done.
Jesus Christ.
Laurie's gonna sell ads.
Isn't that what I told you?
What the fuck am I supposed to do now?
-  - God!
You know I can just tear these up, right?
No, I know.
Good.
-  I like it.
- But can we adjust the proportions?
Make the logo bigger?
And and make the flag bigger?
And and make the box bigger, too.
It all just needs to be bigger.
Okay.
- Bigger.
- Yeah.
- Sir.
- Ah, Hoover.
How's the factory coming?
We almost online?
Not exactly, sir.
It's gone.
What do you mean?
Did that dipshit mayor renege on our deal?
No, he made every effort, including having the factory repainted.
Okay.
So what's the problem?
Well, apparently, the painters left some oily rags in a garbage can.
Mm-hmm.
But because of cuts to the sanitation service, the trash was not collected and the rags smoldered and caught fire.
And because of cuts to the fire department, the blaze spread.
A number of concerned citizens volunteered to help fight the fire, but because the water was cut off, they could not.
Okay, so what happened?
Well, the vast majority of our expensive, rare earth materials survived the fire.
Well, that's something.
Until the flames abated, when because of mass layoffs of police, the locals that were there to fight the fire decided instead to loot the burned-out factory.
The National Guard attempted to reach the factory to help stop this, but - The roads.
- The roads, sir, yes.
Okay.
So, we lost it all?
- Everything?
- Yes.
Also, the IRS called.
Somehow, they found out about Bermuda.
Look, when you take it all into account, turning down our series B and doing an ICO to fund your launch, may actually give you the best odds.
You said ICOs are suicide.
Well, I'm a VC and some of that might have been self-preservational.
Okay.
Well, even if you were exaggerating, you're still right.
I mean, Russ Hanneman had 36 chances to make an ICO work and he basically failed.
I only have one.
Look, Gilfoyle can handle all the technical stuff.
You just need to hire someone who can handle the business side.
- Like who?
- I don't know.
I'm sorry, but I gotta Uber back to the office before Laurie realizes I'm gone.
No, no, wait.
Who do I hire?
Someone who understands securities, right?
Not necessarily.
I mean, your coin doesn't have to be a security.
You could do a utility token instead, since you provide an actual unit of compute.
Although, you'd have to convince the SEC.
Damn it.
Surge pricing.
- Monica.
- You might not even need to bother with a moving average pricing strategy when you launch.
But you will need to keep a close eye on statements from the federal government, South Korea, and China.
So, whoever you do hire should definitely know how to do all that.
Okay, six minutes.
- Monica.
- What?
It's you.
You're the right person.
No.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
Give me one good reason.
I love my job.
You hate working for Laurie.
With Laurie, okay?
We are both equal partners.
Okay.
Look, Monica.
I will do the ICO.
But only if you do it with me.
Come on.
Wait, what's happening?
Canceling my Uber.
- So, you're in?
- Fuck it.
- I'm in.
-  Fuck series B. PiedPiperCoin is totally gonna work.
Yes.
It is.
It totally is.
So, just to confirm, in order for this coin to be worth what series B was worth to all of us, it has to sell for how much?
$68.
I see.
And seven cents is less than that.
Yup.
Whose idea was this again?
I believe the initial idea was Gilfoyle's.
To be fair, it was Monica who really pushed it over the goal line.
Well, I'm gonna head down to the Tesla dealer and beg them to take my car back.
Well, that's something.
And my two referrals fell through.
And I had to return mine.
So now the only Tesla in the office is Priyanka's and I'm paying for that.
So, that's cool.
Richard, adversity is a great teacher.
Just like cigarette burns.
Laurie, hi.
Monica.
- Congratulations on the ICO.
-  Yeah, yeah.
Not quite the numbers we were hoping for.
I'm sure you're happy about that.
On the contrary.
Monica, you have certain values.
And I see no reason you should not work with companies that share them.
Similarly, I should work with companies that share my values.
So, no hard feelings?
No feelings at all, Monica.
We are friends and we should not let business get in the way of that.
Speaking of, I am stepping into a meeting.
Right, well, I'm surprised you're taking this so well, I really appreciate it, Laurie.
Let us talk soon.
Have you received my proposal?
Very promising.
In the land of the lost, we lay down law Chopping off your head to take your face on tour Lacerate your lips, then we shave off more Electrocute your body through the encore When the cops come and try to raid the jams I change my physical form to that of a ram Alakazam, I'm half of a man The other part of me operates robotically Psychology is the dominant factor Believe in the holograms and step into the backdoor Out for AM, more mayhem Five fatal steps to death unless we trace them Five: hesitate to get live Your career's postmortem, now you can't survive Four: perpetuate the folklore Live a lie, you can't identify yourself no more Three: Call yourself an MC Practice minimally and start fucking with me Or the sorcery to the ultimate degree W-A-R W-M-D C-W-O fall in love with the dough Till your spiritual essence Is something that you don't know about Half the time, they don't rhyme Half the time, they all lying Half the time, they all mine Half the time, they all yours Half the time, we on tour
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
1 What are we talking about here?
You want us to launch a cryptocurrency?
You wanted an alternative to Laurie Bream.
Pied Piper Coin.
Mm.
I promised Richard that we would never make them harvest data or sell ads.
I am not saying that we will force their hand on this issue.
But neither am I saying definitively that we will not.
Have you received my proposal?
Very promising.
Look, Monica, I will do the ICO, but only if you do it with me.
Pied Piper Coin is totally going to work.
Yes, it totally is.
Whose idea was this again?
Okay, everybody.
Let's do this.
Photo time.
Let's go.
Front-enders, come on in.
Where's my back-enders?
I see you, crypto-geeks.
Follow me!
Old Pipey thing.
Holden.
Are we set?
Sorry.
I haven't used this camera before.
Are we set?
Yes, Jared.
Look uh, look, guys.
I-I know we didn't have the budget we wanted to get here.
But, we are here.
Finally, all our hard work has paid off.
So now, the world's first, totally decentralized Internet will be live in five CROWD JOINING  Four, three, two, one.
Yeah!
-  -     Richard.
Richard!
Richard.
You have to see this.
What's wrong now?
A good thing.
A good thing has finally happened.
Don't fuck with me.
I am not fucking with you!
Come, come.
Look.
Look at the user numbers.
Wait, holy shit.
Is that right?
I think we've reached the inflection point.
We made it.
- Don't, just don't.
- Yeah.
Well, I think this calls for a little celebration.
I just knew that if we kept plugging away, eventually, we'd get some traction and reach an inflection point.
What did I keep saying?
Give us time and then we'll climb, bitches!
Yes, Holden.
That's right, except for the bitches part, but yes.
And now, we are gaining almost 12,000 users an hour!
Fuck, yeah!
You get a high five and you get a high five!
- Fuck yeah!
- I wanna give a quick shout-out to my seven developers, my Septapipers, who stuck with us through thick and thin, unlike K-Hole, which took their game and totally bailed on us.
Lock them up!
Lock them up!
Jesus, Jared.
You really did a number on that kid.
God.
Yeah.
I just chipped away everything that wasn't Richard's assistant and this is what's left.
Lock them up!
So, how are things advancing?
To date, we have manufactured almost 400,000 mobile devices.
And we are signing them all onto the Pied Piper network?
Yes.
Well, we have to do it manually.
It is slow.
But it provides an advantage.
They may not know what we are doing until it's too late for them to stop us.
Indeed.
Yeah.
To be honest, at times, I find it difficult to tell what you're thinking.
Mmm, I see.
Come on babe Follow me I'm the Pied Piper Follow me I'm the Pied  Pappy Van Winkle?
I'm not gonna have to start locking my desk drawer now, am I?
Hey, does this seem odd to you?
What?
So, our user numbers have been growing for days, but our coin value is flat.
It hasn't budged at all.
I thought the two would be correlated, at least a little bit.
Yeah.
Should be.
Sorry, I don't mean to rain on the parade.
I find parades to be impotent displays of authoritarianism.
Whose bag is this?
- Uh oh.
- Scoot over.
Colin?
- Hey, man.
- What are you doing here?
I like the beard.
You throwing a party?
Yeah.
Something that you and K-Hole Games could've been a part of, had you not walked out on us.
Oh, come on, man.
Laurie was our VC.
She's the one that made me pull the game and bail on you guys.
So you just do whatever Laurie says, huh?
- Well, she had control of my board.
- Hmm.
Which is exactly how she just managed to fire me.
You lost your company?
Aw.
Bummer.
But, the cool part is, I'm free.
Which is why I'm here.
I have been cooking up a solo project on the side for a few years.
It's a killer new game.
And I was thinking maybe, we would launch it on your network.
It's a sweet indie RPG.
I'm calling it "The Gates of Galloo".
I have a ton of presales.
If we put this thing on Pipernet, bam.
You're gonna have 80,000 instant users.
- What do you say?
- You and K-Hole pull your game.
A game that was the central element to our launch strategy.
And then literally days after everything starts to fucking come together, you stroll on in here and act like nothing ever happened?
Stroll?
I just walked in here normally.
Besides, this would help you out too, right?
You you wanna help me out?
You just lost your company.
I'm in there celebrating, with my fucking victory.
Dude.
Can I be real with you?
I really need this.
Can I be realer?
Kiss my piss.
What?
You heard me.
Kiss my piss.
I was hoping you'd be cool about this.
Oh, really?
You thought I might be cool, Mr. Backwards Hat?
Is this cool, huh?
To do this, maybe?
I don't know.
Kiss my piss.
Kiss my piss.
All right, I get it.
Kiss my piss.
I'll see you around, Richard.
Karma's a bitch, Colin.
- Oh!
Monica, hey.
- Hey.
Hey, I was just coming in early to clean up for the custodial staff.
When did you get here?
- We never left.
- We?
All right.
Good to go.
You were both here all night?
Our coin price wasn't growing with our user numbers, so we coded a diagnostic tool to go through the ledger and figure out exactly where our users are coming from.
Yes.
We coded it.
You're smoking my cigarettes, asshole.
In a public workspace, in the state of California, no less.
Shall we?
This breaks our users down by which developers signed them on.
So, each bar is one of our seven Septopipers.
Wait, why are there eight bars?
- Who who's that?
- No idea.
But whoever it is, they are the reason for most of our new user growth.
Wait, so some non-piper out there is signing up users to our network en masse?
How'd they get access to our system?
Without a key from us, the only way in is to steal our software.
But no one has stolen our software.
Except for Oh, shit.
-  -  Hello?
Hey, Jian-Yang.
It's Big Head.
How's it going, man?
He's been in contact with Jian-Yang this whole time?
Yeah, they play Words with Friends.
Cool, cool.
Listen, Gilfoyle wants to ask you a question.
No.
I don't want to talk to Gilfoyle.
He's a racist and a witch.
I'm not a witch.
Now spit out the kimchi and tell me what the fuck is going on with our network.
Fuck you.
I'll tell you nothing.
Okay.
I'll tell you everything.
But I want to move back into the house.
I want to come home.
Wait, what?
It's not that big a deal.
I mean, Jian-Yang could just take Erlich's old room.
So I don't give a fuck about that.
So, Jian-Yang said Gavin Belson tried to buy our stolen software?
Yes, but before he could, he was outmaneuvered by a Chinese man named Yao.
Yao?
Who the fuck is Yao?
This guy.
He's a Chinese manufacturer who just announced a partnership with guess who?
Laurie Bream.
She just led a $200 million round for something called YaoNet.
So Laurie and Yao are manufacturing phones, and signing them onto our network.
But why?
Why would they wanna help us?
Oh, shit.
They're not helping us.
They're attacking us.
It's the 51% attack.
- Has to be.
- I'm sorry, what?
A 51  A 51% attack  The beauty of our decentralized Internet is that no one controls it.
But if 51% were controlled by one entity, like, say, Laurie and Yao, they could rewrite the rules for everyone.
They can delete all of our users, all of our developer apps, crash our coin.
- This would be the end of Pied Piper.
- Fuck!
Okay.
How many devices do they have?
Right now, they have 45% of our total.
- And gaining.
- Wait, Gilfoyle.
Could you write a patch that kicks all of Yao's users off the network?
I would have to rewrite our consensus protocol, but I could probably get that done in eight hours.
Okay, that's good.
And and how long do we have till we lose control of the network?
At this rate, half that.
I just went for a run.
I sprinted up the last bit, there.
I did open palm.
Aaah!
Wh-What's going on?
Richard, there's no easy way to say this.
Jian-Yang is moving back into the house.
Right?
Gavin, you've staked the entire future of this company on the Signature Box Three.
Where are they?
Well, the last two months have been challenging.
The Chinese were petulant.
The North Carolinians proved very entitled.
And I held out hopes for our experiment in the Yukon Territories.
But as it happens, the Inuit are surprisingly adept at collective bargaining.
But fear not, I am in the early stages of a new plan.
Did you know that some of America's most capable, motivated laborers are at this moment awaiting execution?
Gavin.
How many boxes have you actually managed to produce?
Well, we have the 40 prototypes, which we've been using to drive sales.
- And?
- And they are very impressive.
I see.
I guess it's time we tell you.
We've been exploring the viability of an acquisition with Amazon.
The talks are still preliminary, but thus far, they seem quite promising.
You expect me to work for Jeff Bezos?
No fucking way.
I mean, don't take this as any kind of threat, but if Amazon buys this company, I am out.
We spoke to Jeff an hour ago.
It sounds like the two of you are on the same page about that.
Priyanka, start separating legitimate users into their own pool.
Becky, I need you to rate-limit enemy devices.
Danny, find shortcuts to deploy a new consensus protocol.
Sorry, but we're never gonna finish in time.
Not with that attitude.
Yeah, we would need to add a shit ton more users immediately.
Working on it.
Colin, hey.
It's it's Richard Hendricks.
Leaving you another voicemail.
Um, just wanted to talk to you about your game.
And, uh, those, uh, 80,000 users you got there.
And also, to apologize for last night.
You know, I was just really wasted.
I was so drunk.
We had such a crazy party going on.
Anyway, call me back and we'll, uh, we'll chat some "Gates of Galloo".
We'll, uh, we'll "Galloo" it up.
How's that sound?
Well, just call me back.
Okay?
It's it's Richard Hendricks, it's Thank you.
Bye.
- Left another voicemail.
- Doesn't really matter.
He's gonna be off the grid for the next three days.
- What?
- Yeah, I just spoke with his girlfriend.
Whatever the fuck you said, he took really hard.
Colin went camping.
Alone.
Well, did she say where he went?
The Los Trancos Preserve?
Wait.
I know exactly where that is.
I used to go foraging for mushrooms with my friend Muriel there before she passed away.
I could drive up there and and look for him.
It's only 20 miles away and they don't really enforce the speed limit.
Fuck your Volt.
I'll drive.
- What what are you doing?
- I'm borrowing my Tesla.
- It's my Tesla.
- I pay for it.
And if I don't get to Colin in time, Pied Piper ceases to exist.
So, pretty please with a fucking cherry on top, can I borrow the Tesla I bought for you?
- Can Jared drive?
- No.
- Fine.
- Thank you.
So?
So we're fucked.
No, we're not.
Okay, we just We need a few more users to give Gilfoyle some breathing room and And what if you call Dana from Quiver?
He hates me.
Everybody does.
And to be honest, they're right.
I'm an asshole.
No, you're not, Richard.
Yes, I am.
Colin was here last night, out there in the hallway, down on his luck and he was begging me to take his subscribers.
And I told him to kiss my piss.
- You what?
- Kiss my piss.
I said it again and again.
Oh my God.
I did a dance.
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's just move on from this.
I am a spiteful, vengeful prick.
Oh my God, Richard.
Yes, you fucked up.
But that doesn't mean you're a bad person.
Look at you, you're sitting here, regretting it.
That's not the move of an asshole.
Okay?
I mean, you think a guy like Gavin Belson just sits around, feeling bad about being a dick to people?
He doesn't even notice, okay?
The guy's a prick when he was on top and now after everything that just happened, he's still gonna be a prick.
What do you What do you mean?
Everything that just happened.
What happened?
I just read that Amazon's probably gonna be acquiring Hooli.
What?
Yeah, so Gavin Belson's gonna be out on his ass, but do you think he's gonna change at all because of it?
No, he's always gonna be a prick.
Exactly.
Okay, so stop whipping yourself - and let's just figure out what we can do.
- He's a prick.
Yes.
Gavin Belson is a prick.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
He's a he's a total - fucking prick.
- Wait, where are you going?
How could it be this crowded?
Burning Man's in two weeks, so people are beta testing their new gear.
Why would people who aren't refugees choose to come here and live like refugees?
You know that's not, like, a desirable thing, right?
Living like a refugee?
Ugh!
This place is offensive to homeless people.
- GAVIN : Hello?
- Hello, Gavin?
It's Richard Hendricks.
Richard Hendricks.
- Mind the glass.
- Yeah.
Oh.
It's all smashed up again.
What do you want, Richard?
I need your help.
Look, my network is in trouble.
And I know that deep down, in your heart, what you Oh, for fuck's sake.
You're not gonna give me another one of your inspirational, in defense of great technology speeches, are you?
Stand up and fight for innovation, that kind of bullshit?
No.
Exactly the opposite.
I happen to know that a man named Yao fucked you over.
How would you like to fuck him back?
I'm listening.
I need you to attack me.
GAVIN : John?
It's Gavin Belson.
Oh.
Hello.
Listen, John.
Do we still have the prototypes of my Signature Box Three strung up?
Yeah.
They told us they were gonna send more, but they never did.
Well, that's a long story.
- I got time.
- Yeah, listen, John I need you to give admin access to Richard Hendricks.
Becky, did you run connection throttling on the latest batch of device IDs?
Yes.
You know why?
I'm not a moron.
Oh, I see.
I'm the asshole.
Really?
You really wanna have this conversation?
You're both assholes.
Shut the fuck up.
The fuck does it matter.
We're never gonna finish this patch in time, anyway.
- Wait, what the fuck -  just happened?
Dick, where are you?
I'm at Gavin's.
I just gave his boxes permission to mimic a shit-ton of phones on our network.
A second attack.
RICHARD : Yes, exactly.
Now Yao can't get to 51%.
Where are we with the patch?
Close, but you do realize that now that we're below 51%, we can't deploy it.
For now, we can't win.
But since Gavin is holding off Yao, we can't lose either.
He just bought us some time.
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
Well, Gavin, thank you very much.
You just gave me and my guys a fighting chance.
Is that what just happened here, Richard?
Yes.
- No?
- Seems to me, you are the one that just gave me a fighting chance.
Ni hao.
It's Gavin Belson for Mr. Yao.
What the fuck are you doing?
This is the last road, Dinesh.
He's not here.
Colin!
Colin!
Will you shut the fuck up?
How would you like to die today, motherfucker?
No, it's not a real death threat, sir.
-  I'm sorry.
I'm just stressed.
-  Shut up for a second.
You hear that?
So, you want us to delete all of our phones?
Right now, we're in a standoff.
You can't win, but if you back off, I can.
I have more devices than anyone, I will reach 51%, and take control of this little shit's network.
You know, can I chime in here?
I actually think that this is a bad idea, and In exchange for deleting your principal competition, I'm simply asking for a partnership between your venture and Hooli.
Well, he's actually leaving Hooli.
They're firing him.
So I don't know where the connection could For fuck's sake.
I'm sure my board would find an arrangement between YaoNet and Hooli vastly preferable to fire sale-ing the company to Jeff Bezos.
My proposal is I help you, in exchange for a 20% stake in your venture.
And I have a counterproposal, that you do not do that.
Gavin How do we proceed?
Because We like it.
-  -  Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?
- We tried calling you.
- A hundred times.
Yeah, I'm off the grid.
And Done.
All right, so the patch is ready?
Indeed.
Now, maybe someday, Dark Lord willing, we'll actually get to deploy -  - Boo-yah!
We just crushed the patch, Pipers!
Holden, give me that fucking mallet right now!
- Drop it!
- Wait, what the fuck?
Care to tell me what the fuck is going on now?
- Gavin is fucking us.
-  He just convinced Yao to pull his phones.
What the fuck is that noise?
Gavin's making ice cream.
- Fuck.
-  Yeah.
-  Can you kill his devices?
- No, I can't.
He just had his server guy lock me out.
Look, we need Colin.
We need "Galloo," now.
All right, well, it's a pretty straight road from here, so Hold on to your kidneys, motherfuckers!
We are going Ludicrous!
What the fuck?
Oh.
What?
Valet mode.
You put me in fucking valet mode.
You wrecked your Tesla.
You're not wrecking mine.
Come on, that caps me at 70 miles per hour, limits performance to 80 kilowatts.
Come on, you have to let me do Ludicrous Mode, now!
I've been a total gentleman about this.
I have Colin!
I want two more months of payments.
One more month.
Fine.
Do not crash.
Here we go.
Three two one    We've got all 63 distributed systems engineers on the job, Gavin.
The patch you asked for is nearly finished.
Wonderful.
Call me when we hit 51%.
Hey, Richard.
I know what might cheer you up.
How about a little ice cream?
Come on, guys.
Where the fuck are you?
Well, this is fucked.
I heard on a podcast that patrol men are actually a lot more tempted by bribes than you might think.
Officer, hi.
Is there anything I can do to make this all go away?
Sir, I would think very carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth.
- Oh, shit.
-  - Well, look at that.
-  51%.
Yeah, Scott?
Yes, I know.
I just saw.
No, not yet.
Hold on a moment.
Gavin.
What is our status?
Friends, I'm about to delete Mr. Hendricks' life's work.
I thought you'd wanna see it happen.
Richard, was that too mean?
Oh, well.
Should we get to it?
- Scott - Wait.
Take it.
Just take it.
Take what?
Pied Piper.
The whole network.
All of it.
Just please don't destroy it.
I'd rather give it away than watch it die.
As much as I hate to admit, who better to take it than you, Gavin?
I mean, you're really the only one who realizes what the decentralized Internet could be.
I find this uninteresting.
Can we proceed?
You wrote the patent and gave it to me.
Hell, you hired the best 63 distributed systems engineers in the city.
I mean, you could build this into what it was meant to be.
Gavin, enough.
Come on, you know that my network is way better than some knockoff.
And instead of taking a minority stake in their company, you could take total control of mine.
Why would you turn that down?
Let's make it official.
I will, uh I will sign my company over to you.
It's yours, Gavin.
You win.
Okay?
Take it.
Just please don't delete it.
All our phones are turned off, now.
Gavin, delete Pied Piper immediately or we will walk away.
Not if I walk away first.
Sorry, but this gives me all the cards.
I get Hooli back.
Fuck Bezos and fuck you and your 20% offer.
And fuck the Signature Box Three.
I get a complete do-over.
Tim Cook keeps inviting me to his brunches.
Fuck him!
I'll host the fucking brunches.
All because Mr. Hendricks here was kind enough to Sorry, what does this say?
- Kiss my - Piss.
Kiss my piss.
Kiss my piss.
Richard, please stop the movement.
Kiss my piss.
- I find it annoying.
-  Kiss my piss.
Yes, we don't like it.
What the fuck are you doing, Richard?
What does it look like?
I'm fucking you over, Gavin.
- You're what?
- I was stalling!
"Galloo"?
What the fuck is "Galloo"?
Kaboom.
You just got 80,000 new users.
Oh!
Yes.
Scott.
Run the patch.
It's not working.
We've lost control of the network.
Gilfoyle when you're ready.
Bombs away.
What the fuck just happened?
Colin, you did it.
You saved us.
No.
That was all Dinesh.
That was quick fucking thinking with that cop.

I like you.
Not in a  Fuck yeah!
- Yeah.
- You understand what I'm saying.
Sure.
Come on, don't be assholes.
We can still do our deal.
You still need an American partner for your network, don't you?
I believe we are now entitled to explore other options.
Thanks for the help, Gavin.
And, uh, thanks for the ice cream.
We will tell Jeff Bezos you say hello.
- Yes?
- Yes.
Yes.
-  -  Fuck!
And we'd be right up here.
- Ooh!
Love the video fireplace.
- Yeah.
Wow.
It's magnificent.
It's a little bright.
But I could find a dark corner to settle into.
It's great.
When do these guys move out?
Oh, no, this isn't our space.
We're actually right through here.
Here we go.
What do you guys think?
Uh, I'm sorry.
What part of this would we be renting?
All of it.
What?
Yeah, we're signing new developers every day.
That's gonna require hundreds of new engineers, Richard.
And the staff to support them.
Legal, accounting, HR, government affairs.
Whoa.
Why would we need that?
To deal with things like the NSA.
They called yesterday.
They have a lot of questions about our tech.
And about inserting a back door.
We can push back.
Against the government?
-  I don't love that.
-  I do.
Do you guys wanna see the second floor?
There's another floor?
There's three more, actually.
This all used to be part of Hooli.
Okay.
