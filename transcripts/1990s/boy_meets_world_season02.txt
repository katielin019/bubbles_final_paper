{START OF EPISODE 1}
Cory, let's go!
You wanna be late for your first day of high school?
Alan, don't yell at him.
He's probably a nervous wreck.
Hey, Mom!
Hey, Dad!
How ya doing?
- Hey, Morgan, lookin' short.
- Go back to camp, loser.
- Cor, you're not?
- A nervous wreck?
No, because I know my place.
I understand where I am in the high school universe.
See, I'm starting off a nothing - a zero.
A big booger.
You know how you tell me, the earlier I do my homework, - the better I'll know the stuff?
- You've done homework?
It's a metaphor.
But all summer long, I bugged Eric about what high school's gonna be like.
- And I took notes.
- Ooh impressive.
Thank you.
So, how do I avoid years and years of abuse and humiliation?
Don't get married.
- It's a metaphor.
- All right, here's my plan.
Today I make friends with the most feared and influential senior in high school - Harley Keiner.
And in one master stroke, I go from lowly first year victim, to Harley's most trusted advisor.
Cor, as proud as I'd be to see you become Harley's toady footstool, you don't have to reinvent yourself for high school.
Yeah, really, relax.
Go, enjoy it.
You don't need a plan.
Nobody else has a plan.
Cory, I lost my copy of the plan.
I knew I shouldn't have left the old school.
I was so cool in the old school.
They had no right to pass me.
I am an idiot!
See?
Shawn's not reinventing himself.
Shawn are those sideburns?
You mean the ones on my face?
It's just that when you saw you yesterday, they weren't on your face, were they?
Mrs. Matthews, you just can't accept the fact that Cory and I are growing up.
And we're old enough now to buy our own hair.
- You've got a glue spot on your cheek.
- Oh OK, thanks.
All right, look, we've got all the answers to high school right here.
- Having a big brother finally paid off.
- Cor, sign this.
"With regard to my brother, Eric Matthews, hereafter referred to as 'Oh, Great One,' I, Cory Matthews, hereafter referred to as 'insignificant speck,' pledge never to contact the "Great One", verbally or non-verbally, during any and all school hours, from this day forward, forever and ever.
" Amen.
Nice to see you're looking out for your brother on his first day.
Dad, word gets out I'm related to a seventh grader, I lose all my status.
I mean, I might as well just strap on a tuba and join the band.
So your social status means more to you than your brother?
Mom, look, I don't like walking all over Cory any more than you do.
It's just to keep up appearances.
I mean, he's my brother.
Of course I love him.
Amy, Alan etcetera.
So Mr. Feeny, are you feeling any regret that you're losing us from your class?
No.
What can we do for you, George?
There is a large, rusty object, blocking not only my driveway, - but most of the light into my kitchen.
- That's my new car.
May I assume it moves?
Sure, like the wind.
Especially downhill.
Oh, you want me to move it?
Well, we certainly can't count on anyone stealing it.
You know, it just hit me.
High school means we're through with Feeny.
This is the greatest day of our lives.
- Yes!
- Yes!
How do you do Do, do, do You know what, Shawn?
- We're in high school now.
- Yeah, we do have to be cooler.
Hey!
- Ooh, yeah - Gotcha!
Oh, give it to me!
Ooh, yeow, yeah!
Dude This is it - high school.
What happens to us now will determine our entire futures.
- This is it!
- Ouch!
Ooh High school!
What happens to us now will determine our entire futures.
Are my sideburns on straight?
Shawn, what are you worried about?
Look, it's just a school.
There's no lockers.
There's a class and a kid in his underwear.
- They took my clothes!
- Who?
- Seniors.
Seniors took my clothes.
- Why?
Just 'cause I'm a new guy.
- Well, I'm a new guy.
- Well, good luck to ya.
- Uh, Cor?
- No, no.
Don't worry about it.
He must've had it coming.
He must've done something Hey!
- What did I do?
!
- You were almost in my way.
You're Frankie Stecchino, right?
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- "Strong territorial sense.
" We are just looking for our homeroom, you know?
It's in there.
- In there?
- Right there.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hey, I'm the first one here.
And now for you.
Why was you almost in my way?
You know, if I was in my homeroom, I wouldn't be anywhere near your way.
- Huh?
- I think he's saying, that if he was someplace else, he wouldn't be here.
What?
You saying I'm gay?
No.
No, I didn't say that.
Come on, let's finish him off.
No, I need to be alone with my thoughts.
- I think we can go now.
- No, thanks.
I think I feel a lot safer in here.
But the view is better out here.
Shawn, if Harley Keiner's the biggest and meanest, then who are those two who almost killed us?
What if they were the nice guys?
What if they're the welcoming committee?
What is this place?
- Hi.
- Topanga!
- What's with you guys?
- We just missed you, that's all.
Walk in front of us.
- What are you staring at?
- Uh nothing.
- New blouse?
- Yeah, I got it over the summer.
Summer was very good to you.
- Yeah, well, at least what I grew is real.
- Ouch!
That's homeroom.
I checked the list, we're all together.
Room 218.
We have Mr. Turner.
Turner Turner He's not on here.
What if he was so bad, Eric didn't want to tell me anything?
What if he was just like Feeny?
Only Feenier.
Teachers - the one thing here, I am not afraid of.
I haven't met one yet that I couldn't take down.
- Hey!
- Hey.
That is Harley, I know it.
That is Harley Keiner.
- That guy's gotta be 30 years old.
- He's a lifer.
I think I made a very good first impression.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sir?
My name's Cory Matthews - and I want to be your friend.
- Cool.
Yeah.
I'll hold your coat for you, I'll stand in lunch line for you.
- I'll even do detention for you.
- Yeah, nice offer.
Why don't you just do the homework?
I'm not sure you want me doing your homework.
I want all my students doing the homework.
You're so mean they gave you students?
They give all the teachers students.
I'm Jonathan Turner.
You can call me "Mr. " You're late.
OK, I'm here for homeroom.
I'm here for English and I'm here anytime you just wanna talk.
- Cool.
- Did I say you could talk?
- I thought so - You trouble, Matthews?
You the guy who's gonna bring down the new teacher?
No, sir, that would be Shawn.
- I mean that - No, Matthews.
Good man, good man.
Shawn Wait, don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Now, if Shawn is real trouble, Shawn is really gonna try to avoid making eye contact with Hi, Shawn.
- How ya doing?
- I'm good.
So, Shawn, buddy You know anything about The Odyssey?
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah, besides that it's a book.
No, I don't.
OK.
Who knows what "odyssey" means?
- What's your name?
- Topanga.
- Topanga.
- It means a difficult journey.
Yes, it does.
An epic journey.
About a guy just trying to get home alive.
In fantasy worlds, with characters who have these ancient notions - about loyalty and heroism.
- Yeah, who wants to read that?
Yeah, apparently you do.
- What is that, X-Men?
- No, it's What, I don't know X-Men when I see it?
It's a great issue, wasn't it?
- You read X-Men?
- Do I read X-Men?
Fantasy worlds, epic heroism Yeah, I read X-Men.
In fact, let's all read X-Men.
Your assignment is to read The Odyssey and this issue of X-Men.
Finally!
A cool teacher.
My friend, Mr. Matthews, will lead the discussion on the similarities and the differences.
Feeny with an earring.
Shawn, he's on to us.
He singled us out on the first day.
No, Cory.
He singled you out on the first day.
- You singled me out.
- Sorry.
So, where's the next stop on this misery bus?
Uh Earth Science.
Let's go.
I don't have Earth Science.
I've got History.
- You mean - We're gonna be separated?
- No!
Shawn!
- No!
Cory!
Friday, Dylan's parents are going out of town and Hey, Eric!
You know me?
I heard of you.
Eric Matthews, right?
Cool junior.
Only child.
Yeah, everybody's heard of you.
Even insignificant specks like me, who are having the worst possible day of their lives.
- I don't care.
- Thanks.
See ya.
So Harley, last year of high school again, huh?
- Thinking about going to college?
- Yeah.
This year I might even take the SOTs.
Harley Keiner?
How the heck are ya?
How the heck am I?
Kill him.
Hey, look, it's the kid from when you were scared.
What?
I need time.
Look, Harley, I'll make this short and sweet.
Everyone knows you're a tough guy, a vicious guy.
But that's all they know.
If you made friends with a seventh grader and just, you know, looked out for him all year, everyone would like you even more.
- What's your name, kid?
- Cory Matthews.
Nah that's a poufy name.
If you're gonna hang with me, you've gotta have a name that inspires fear and respect.
Let me look at you.
I got it.
From now on, you are Johnny Baboon.
Cool.
The bell rang, gentlemen, several minutes ago.
What are you doing in the hall?
You shouldn't be in the hall.
What's your name?
Johnny Baboon.
You're making fun of me?
Nobody makes fun of Marion Stimpleman!
Marion.
To the principal's office, both of you.
- What did I do, Marion?
- You're with him, Keiner.
You should learn to pick your friends better.
OK, we will see the principal in alphabetical order.
OK, you first, Baboon.
I only wanted us to be liked.
Now I'm Johnny Baboon.
- At least my life can't get any worse.
- Wrong again Mr. Baboon - Mr. Feeny?
- The legend continues.
- Wait, you're the principal here?
- Acting principal.
Oh, so that means you're only temporary, right?
I mean, you don't have the full authority to authorize, let's say, detention or caning?
No, the school board in it's infinite wisdom has seen fit to give me full authority.
Now, then, Mr. Stimpleman, what exactly did Mr. Matthews do?
Got on my nerves.
I can't imagine.
Well, Mr. Matthews, why don't we treat this little rendezvous as a dress rehearsal for the many visits we'll undoubtedly have this year.
- Huh?
- Get out of my face.
Oh, sure.
My next class is, uh, American History with Mr. Fee Mr. Fe Fe You're late.
So, Johnny, I just wanted to thank you for the chance of meeting our new school principal and getting detention all week with my good friend, Marion.
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Oh, think nothing of it.
By the way, Johnny B., do you think you could meet me in the senior bathroom, - say around 3:00?
- Sure.
What for, gang pictures?
No, when I get through killing you, you won't be so photogenic.
- You're gonna kill me?
- Oh, yeah oh, yeah.
I really, really, really am.
But not until 3:00.
Enjoy your lunch.
- Ah, Mr. Turner, if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sit down.
And the word I believe would be "Shazam"!
Yes, George, I did assign a classic comic book.
I realize that you're the new "groovy" teacher and I'm the hard-bound traditionalist.
I just thought I might use the material to sort of relate to them on their level.
Oh.
Mr. Turner, their level is the level of the Beasts of the Field.
I want them off that level and closer to our level or should I say my level.
- George?
- Mm-hmm?
You really think I'm a groovy teacher?
I think, Mr. Turner, it shall be an interesting school year.
Well, we got off to a rocky start, but at least we made it to lunch.
Aah!
Well, you got off to a rocky start, but at least you made it to lunch.
Yep, my last meal.
Chicken.
How appropriate.
You know, I wish it'd been macaroni and cheese.
Because when Harley punches me and I puke on him, it makes a bigger mess.
Good thinking.
Here's better thinking - ask your brother for help.
I can't.
I signed that contract.
- You got a car, the new Mustang?
- Yeah.
Uh only a little older and a little bigger.
It's the new Mustang-Buick.
- Psst!
Oh, great one - What are you doing here, Shawn?
I-I'm just calling him that.
I don't know that his name is Shawn or anything.
Too bad.
- Well?
- OK, it's about your brother.
It's school hours.
I have no brother.
Yeah, and at 3:00, you'll really have no brother.
Make this quick.
Help!
How could you possibly get into this much trouble in one day?
It didn't take me a whole day.
All right, look Last bell, head straight to the nurse's office.
Tell them you're sick.
You have to have Mom and Dad come and pick you up.
- Won't I look like a coward?
- Yeah, you will.
So why don't you fight him?
All right, who took the last piece of chicken?
!
I'm gonna kill the guy who took the last piece of chicken.
And the nurse's office is where?
Do not attempt to recontact me.
So, what do you got?
Oh, you know, I got fever and chills and the fluttering pelvis.
- I got a broken nose.
- Got that.
- Sprained arm.
- Got that.
- And I got asthma.
- Ooh We're just gonna wait here in the nurse's office - until our parents or guardians pick us up.
- That's what we're gonna do everyday.
You're gonna sit in the nurse's office everyday?
- It's safe.
- Safe.
We like safe.
Aren't you worried what other guys will think?
- I mean, that they'll think you're - Cowards?
So, cowards.
We're only gonna be in this school six years.
No big deal.
You know, I'm not gonna sit here and fake an injury like a coward.
I'm gonna go get a real one.
Wow, 3:00!
We made it through the day.
- Who's next?
- Ouch!
Lucky.
Hey, Matthews, we survived day one, huh?
The day is young, Sir and so was I. - I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah, I'll be the one face-up in the suit.
You OK, Matthews?
You know, Mr. Turner, you know that book you gave us, The Odyssey?
- Yeah.
- Did the guy in that get home alive?
Yes, he did.
He gets past the Cyclops, the evil sirens and the clashing rocks.
Did he go to this high school?
- No.
- He's a nothing.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Got here as quick as I could.
I want you to know, that whatever happens, I'm right here with you.
Thanks, Shawn, but I'm pretty sure this is something I gotta face alone.
Well, I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right leaving you here.
- There you are, Shawn.
- Now it feels right.
Well, it's five after three.
Maybe he's not gonna show.
And maybe I'm just trying to be casually late, Mr. Anal-compulsive.
Look, don't toy with me.
I was looking forward to high school.
I had a plan.
I gave you a chance to change your whole future, and not be a guy who beats up on kids who are smaller than you, for the rest of your life.
- You're giving me that chance?
- Yeah.
Well, here I stand at the crossroads of my life.
Yet, I am what I am, and I must kill you.
Aren't you gonna run or whine or something?
- No.
- Oh?
I am what I am, too.
I'd rather be dead than be the school coward for the next six years.
- You done?
- Guess I am.
Guess again!
- What are you doing here?
- I have no idea.
But I do know that I'm not gonna stand by and let you beat up somebody that I don't even know at all.
- OK, OK, he's my brother.
- Oh - This is your brother?
- Didn't he just say that?
Did not he just say I'm his brother?
- Just how stupid - Cory, don't provoke.
Well, how sweet.
A chance to wipe out the whole Baboon family.
We gotta hose the place down.
Who the heck are you?
Oh, I'm your worst nightmare.
I'm a teacher.
Oh, a teacher.
No wonder I don't recognize ya.
- What do you teach?
- English Lit and kick boxing.
- What seems to be the problem?
- Nothing.
We were working it out.
Actually, it looks like you're about to pound this kid into the ground.
See that's a problem for me.
'Cause if one of my students gets killed the first day- I look bad.
People start to talk, I get a reputation.
I'm careless with students, you know?
So do me a favor, don't kill my student.
- Could I take you?
- Nah.
- But I could've taken the kid though.
- Good for you.
So, Odysseus, looks like you may get home safely.
- Thanks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Read the book.
I lived it.
- Hey, Eric, I want to tell you something.
- What do you want to say to me?
Thanks for being my brother.
Do I know you?
Shawn Shawn, you can come out.
The fight's over.
Our high school reputations are set.
I'm still working on mine.
Big lockers in high school.
Ladies and gentlemen, moms, dads and weasels I give you the man who said he didn't have a brother.
The man who said he didn't know me.
Eric "The Great One" Matthews!
Aw, some goon at school was trying to pick on Cory.
Just because he's bigger than him.
Don't you hate that?
I hate that!
- I know, I hate that too.
- Who asked you, speck?
Give me this.
- Hey, I'm watching that.
- What?
!
- I'm just trying - Hey, don't hit the kids.
Hey, everybody be quiet.
I'm trying to watch TV.
That's power.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
- Richard and Cindy?
- Very deeply in love.
- Since when?
- Lunch.
What did they eat?
I don't know, but it doesn't look like it was enough.
Ah, Mr. Heckle and Mr. Jekkyl, don't we have classes to attend?
Mr. Feeny, shouldn't you break them up or hose them down or something?
Oh, I wouldn't interrupt their tryst, Mr. Matthews.
They're both A-minus students and happily struck by Cupid.
So, if they were C-minus students, you wouldn't let them kiss?
- School policy, don't you know.
- So I can't kiss?
With your grades, Mr. Matthews, you can't even shake hands.
Just watch, Mr. Feeny.
By the end of the year, I plan to have an A-plus average and a hickey.
Dare to dream, Mr. Matthews.
Holy cow.
Jerry and Shoshanna?
Deeply.
- Has the whole world paired off?
- Pretty much.
Is there a list posted somewhere where I find out what girl's been assigned to me?
You want a girlfriend?
No, not a girlfriend, just a girl who's like a friend, but not a girlfriend.
- How about her?
How about the new girl?
- No.
I mean, I don't know her.
Shut up.
Look, I want someone I know, someone who knows me, someone who we know each other, someone like, uh Topanga!
Topanga, my honey.
- May I call you honey?
- No.
Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend.
Believe me, I don't want this any more than you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together.
Cory, my dear little butthead May I call you butthead?
Sure.
- I can't walk through life with you.
- Is there someone else?
There's everybody else.
Why?
We're already standing together, and we look great.
Oh, come on.
Work with me here.
Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love.
Then, after a week, they hate each other.
So for one great passionate week, we'd lose a friendship that could last a lifetime.
- I'm in if you are.
- Cory, don't worry.
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
Gimme a name!
- For the record, I dumped her.
- That's how I saw it.
Well, Dubin's out sick again.
Health teacher sick again?
Not a lot of credibility.
I wonder what kind of creepy substitute we'll get today.
Wow.
That is no substitute.
That is the real thing.
Good afternoon, class.
I'm Ms. Kelly, and I'll be filling in for Mr. Dubin for the next few days.
On behalf of the entire class, I'd like to say stay as long as you like.
Now, right now, you seem to be covering CPR, and I'm today's dummy.
No, actually, we seem to be up to human reproduction, which I hope we can discuss in a mature fashion.
Oh, stop being so young.
You know, I'm not as young as they are.
I've stayed back, like, 50 times.
- Really?
How old are you?
- 24?
Really?
What are you doing in a seventh-grade classroom?
I'm a cop.
Sit down.
All right, but I'm watching you.
All right, who can tell us the name of the organ where the eggs are stored?
Officer?
Oh, sorry, Ms. Kelly.
I don't have that stuff.
I can name the stuff I have.
Or at least what I call them.
All right, the name of the place where the eggs are stored.
What are the gonads?
No, sorry.
I was looking for, what are the ovaries?
Oh, the o Yeah, I always mix those two up.
Try not to.
Your future will be brighter.
Can you tell us anything about ovulation or how pregnancy occurs?
Well, the man's got the sperm, and the woman's got the egg.
Now, once a month, an egg slides down the Philippine tube towards the uterus.
The first sperm to reach the egg wins, it gets a medal, it's born, you name him Cory, you push him out the door, and nothing makes sense for the rest of his life.
Congratulations.
You seem to have a thorough understanding of the life cycle.
- Hey, I live it.
- Any questions?
Yes?
How do you get a girl to say hi?
Michael and Lisa Marie?
- Looks like it.
- Since when?
- Just now.
That was it.
- What, that?
- Yeah.
You saw it happen.
- I can't believe it.
I saw it happen, and I still don't know how it happens.
Stop obsessing, man.
You're gonna pop a lobe.
You're right.
I should relax, 'cause this coupling thing, it's just a phase.
I mean, how long can it last a few weeks?
The cafeteria's right this way.
They know me there.
I'll get us a good table.
- You would do that for me?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm very tight with Bertha, the lunchroom lady.
Yeah, I once rescued a dolphin from her hair net.
OK, maybe it'll last a few years.
Yes, I'm acting principal now, and the pressures would be daunting for a man half my age.
Fortunately I have a vitality that belies my years.
I'm the only one who doesn't know how it's done.
Listen, I think I found something that kind of works.
- What?
- This.
Hi, Shawn.
- Wow.
From across the hall.
- Yep, I got a 30-foot range.
- What, you just jerk your head?
- Watch again.
I'm still young enough, I can do this twice in a row.
Shawn, it's so strange.
I was just thinking about you.
And that's without conditioner.
Cory, what is it?
- You were just drawn to me, weren't you?
- No, I thought you had head lice.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.
- Oh, good.
- Hi, Topanga.
I was just thinking about you.
I need new hair.
Hi, Mom.
This is Rebecca.
It's kind of a new relationship, so don't say anything too embarrassing, OK?
Oh, hi, Rebecca.
He wet his bed till he was 12.
Oops.
Wanna sit?
Hey Weasel, you wanna move your stuff off the table?
We gotta cram for the math test tomorrow.
My name's not Weasel, it's Morgan.
I thought you liked it when I called you Weasel.
I've never liked it.
You like it so much, it's your name now Weasel.
- What an assertive little sister you have.
- Oh, it's the uniform.
When she takes it off, she has a vulnerable side, I'm almost certain.
OK, Morgan, soccer practice.
Remember what we learned last week?
Don't kick the coach.
Hey, before we get started, why don't we take a break?
Can I get you something to drink?
I got full access to all the major appliances in the kitchen.
Aren't you gonna show me your house first?
The house?
You wanna see the house?
Sure.
Uh, this is the house.
Are there any other rooms?
Uh, yeah, there's probably one right through here.
Do you wanna?
All right.
Hey, I was right.
This is the living room.
This is where we live.
And this is the couch where much of the sitting takes place.
Aren't you gonna show me the, uh, upstairs?
Yeah, boy, yeah, boy, yeah, boy.
The upstairs.
I love the upstairs.
You know, we weren't even gonna have an upstairs, but I made 'em put it in because I knew you were coming.
Nobody told me about this girl thing, Shawn.
I mean, no one warned me.
I thought they were just there.
I didn't know they were interactive.
You'll get the hang of it.
Sure.
It's easy for you.
Your hair moves.
- There's other techniques.
- Like what?
I don't know.
I just do hair.
Yeah, but where do I get my technique?
Ask your brother.
He's got the boom.
You know what?
Let's just forget this whole subject.
There are a million other things to do in the world.
I mean, we're too young to worry about finding mates.
- You're right.
See ya.
- Where are you going?
Off to meet girls.
I've got a 30-foot range.
- Is that you, Shawn?
- Get out.
Fine.
No girls for me.
I'll just study and get good grades and get smart and become a famous scientist, and then I'll build a wife.
I'm bored.
What's that?
Mom?
Dad?
Are you home?
- Cory, we're studying.
- So am I. Don't go, Rebecca.
Sorry.
I really don't feel like being here anymore.
You haven't seen the whole house.
Let me take you up to the roof.
Actually, Eric, I think it's nice we didn't go any further than we did.
- Thank you.
- No prob.
Why don't we just study together like we planned?
- I need to study alone.
- So I'll see you Friday?
No.
OK, then!
So, what's new?
- I'm gonna kill you.
- I have you.
I'm gonna kill you, I'm gonna bring you back to life, and I'm gonna kill you again.
- I have you.
- What?
!
What do you have?
You have what I have nothing!
You, my boy, were in Mom and Dad's bed.
Oh, ho-ho-ho.
What was that, the sound of power suddenly shifting?
Nothing happened.
Yeah, and it didn't happen in Mom and Dad's bed.
I have you.
I have you by your ovaries.
Hey, Cor, buddy, I'm not gonna kill you.
That was one of those wacky brother-to-brother murder threats.
Yeah.
Listen, I'd like you to do something for me.
- Anything you need.
- Tell me how you do it.
What I was doing with Rebecca?
No, no, what you were doing with Rebecca, I don't have the lung capacity for that.
I just wanna know, how do you get a girl to say hi?
- Oh, you're wasting my time.
- I have you.
Now, ordinarily I wouldn't reveal my foolproof method, but I know I can count on my favorite little brother to keep a secret.
I'm listening.
- OK, you got eyes?
- Yeah.
- Use 'em.
- How?
Look at her.
Look into her.
Look through her.
I mean, make her think she's the most exquisite thing your eyes have ever beheld.
- Who her?
- Who cares?
Pick somebody.
Well, how do I pick?
- You got eyes?
- I thought we established that.
Make eye contact.
Make her eyes believe that your eyes are interested in her.
- So I have to be interested in her.
- No, you're overachieving.
You only have to make her think you are.
So we find, in Fielding's novel, the character Tom Jones is absolutely irresistible to women.
- Isn't that right, Matthews?
- Uh, yeah, that's right.
- What's right?
- What you just said.
- What'd I just say?
- You weren't listening, either?
Matthews, keep your head facing this way.
Shawn, tell your buddy what I was saying.
Uh, he was saying, "Matthews, you're not listening.
" Thank you.
Did either one of you guys do the reading assignment?
- Some of it.
- What did you read?
I read the page you handed us with the reading assignment on it.
Yay!
Yay!
- What?
- Oh, uh Uh, I was just looking at your hair.
I'm very interested in your hair.
- Why?
- Because it's it's interesting hair.
I mean, it's very exquisite hair.
It's the most exquisite hair my eyes have ever beheld.
Well, actually, I did comb it differently this morning.
So, um, with all that said, would you be interested in going out with me?
All right.
I guess so.
When?
- Uh, tomorrow, after school.
- OK.
See you then.
Has a brand-new couple taken shape before my very eyes?
What can I say?
I've got the boom!
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
Yeah, you got your, uh floor-length flannel armor on there.
- This happens to be very comfortable.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, you're looking positively Amish.
Alan tomorrow I have three busloads of these Garden Club ladies coming to the gallery, and some of the paintings are just a little risquÃ©.
RisquÃ©?
What do you mean?
Like flannel-off-the-shoulder kind of What is with this?
Is this welded on?
I'm a little stressed, OK?
Well, I'm just the guy to relieve that stress.
- How's that?
- It helps.
Mm-hmm.
- Ow!
- Was that a good "ow"?
No, it wasn't you.
It was this.
Whose earring is this?
- Well, it's not yours?
- No.
Well, I-I-I have no idea.
Honestly, I don't know who-whose earring that is.
Alan, sweetheart, I'm not accusing you.
- Why not?
- I know you're not having an affair.
Oh, you think I'm safe?
You think other women aren't attracted to me?
- I haven't said anything.
- And, boy, are you oh so wrong.
Just today at the store, this slim little blonde with a low-cut dress, she came up to me and asked me if the bread was fresh.
Alan, sweetheart, I know there are still many women that still are attracted to you.
- You don't sound very threatened.
- I'm threatened.
I know I could lose you at any moment.
Oh, stop that.
We just found an earring in our bed.
I know a cheap, tacky one, the kind of thing a teenager would wear.
- Eric!
- What about Eric?
The earring.
Eric was with a girl alone in this house.
Oh, boy.
OK, sweetheart, I will go have a talk with him.
No, no, no.
I will talk to him.
I don't want to have any of that father-son winking thing going on.
- What father-son winking?
- No, I-I don't want to see you go, "Son, what you did was wrong," and then, "Attaboy.
" I don't want to see that.
- You think I'd do that?
- I think you'd do that.
Well, I wouldn't do that.
That just goes to show you don't know me at all.
We'll both just go have a talk with my son.
- My son.
- Ugh!
- Hello.
- You want to tell us anything?
Uh not yet.
Now I got something to tell you.
We found this in our bed.
What was it you wanted to tell us?
I just wanted to say, "Happy Birthday, Mom.
" The other one's on layaway.
Nothing happened between me and Rebecca, if that's what you're thinking.
Why should we believe that nothing happened?
Look at my face.
Do I look happy?
Nothing happened.
Well, I'd like to know what you were doing bringing a girl into our room.
And don't give us some lame-o excuse like, "She wanted a tour of the house.
" OK.
We were on the roof replacing tiles when we fell through the ceiling, and luckily your bed broke our fall.
Eric, you're in some big trouble here.
Hey, go easy on him, I need this brother.
He taught me how to get what I want from a girl.
- Excuse me?
- He taught me how to get a date, - and it worked big-time.
- Oh, I see, and who is this girl?
- Uh, I don't know her name.
- You don't know her name?
Not yet, but I'm gonna find out before I make any type of commitment.
How can you manage to ask a girl out if you don't know her name?
- All part of Eric's foolproof method.
- Cory, get the phone.
- Oh, Eric has a foolproof method?
- Ring!
Ring!
- Go ahead, Cory.
- All right, first you pick a girl, any girl.
- Just any-ol-body.
- Yeah.
Then you pretend you're interested in her.
Now you don't really have to be interested in her.
I thought you did, but Eric said it wasn't necessary.
- Ring!
- That's what you told him?
What?
Does it matter what I told him?
I'm dead.
You had the big sex talk with him two years ago.
What did you tell him?
Not that!
How can you think I'd tell him that?
- Alan, I'm not accusing you.
- Yes, you are.
You're accusing me of this, and yet you refuse to accuse me of having an affair.
That hurts.
Cory, I know you look up to your brother, but I want you to go to your father for advice on this subject.
Eric has some explaining to do about his own behavior with girls lately.
- I know.
- What do you know?
Pretty much everything.
I kind of walked in on them.
Amazing grace - On Eric and his friend in our room?
- How could this happen?
Dad, Rebecca sat down on the bed and went like this Oh, so this is her fault.
And you bear no responsibility?
- Clearly, I should have locked the door.
- Eric, you're missing the point.
No, I know the point, Dad.
I should have controlled myself, but nothing happened.
Eric, Eric, you are in so deep.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm really, really s You know, for thousands of years, fathers have said to their sons, "Don't rush into sex," and the sons have always said, "Yeah, sure.
OK".
I didn't understand my father till this very moment, and you won't understand me till you're a father, which won't be for a very long time!
- Dad?
- Learn her name!
- Yes, sir.
- As for you Rebecca.
Her name was Rebecca.
- Is that all you know about her?
- Well, not too much more, I guess.
- Does that make you feel good?
- No, it doesn't.
Eric, every once in a while, let your brain in on what the rest of you is doing.
Are you two both clear on this?
But if I can't use Eric's method, then how do I get a girl to say hi?
- Cory - Yeah?
What did you know about girls before your brother's excellent advice?
- I didn't know anything.
- Why don't you just go with that?
Um, ready to go?
Look, are you feeling a little funny about this?
You mean, about going out on a date?
Yeah, because we don't even know each other.
A little funny.
So do you wanna, like, not go out on a date?
- Yeah, it doesn't feel right.
- I understand.
But we should still get to know each other.
Oh, that would be nice.
Yeah, because then, in case we ever did want to go out, well, we'd know each other.
So, um, how do you want to get to know each other?
Well, we could go somewhere and talk if you don't have something else to do.
Well, I did, but, um now I'm suddenly free.
Great.
Let's go.
So, uh, what do you want to talk about?
Well, um, do you know my name?
- Uh - It's Wendy.
Wendy.
- Wendy?
- Yeah?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Lot of homework?
- Yeah, a lot.
You?
Yeah.
Look, Cory, I know I've been forbidden to give you any advice on any subject ever again, so if there's any information you'd like to voluntarily offer about the current events of your life, I'm listening.
- How was my date?
- Yeah.
- I had a real good time.
- So, what was your technique?
Look, I know you know everything there is to know about women and I don't know anything, so I did what I do best I was real nervous and I nodded a lot.
Did she like that?
I don't know, but when we were done, I asked her if she maybe wanted to go out again.
She said, "Yeah, I would.
" Cool.
- Cor?
- Yeah?
So, how did you nod?
I mean, was it like this or?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Ah, Eric, yes.
That feels so good!
Don't stop!
OK, we found my brother.
This personality profile of our new principal is superlative.
Well, the man lives next door.
Glad I could give some help.
Yes.
Well, you give a wonderful neck massage.
You know, Molly, I'm more than just a pair of strong, masculine hands.
Well, of course you are, my little cabana boy.
Well, finis!
No, no.
It's "Feeny.
" His name is Feeny.
"Finis" is French for "finished.
" Ha-ha, the French our neighbors to the north.
- Hello!
- Not now, I'm working.
You said you'd drive us home.
Hey, babe, you're wiggin' out the rats!
Rats?
Yeah.
We're studying natural selection.
We're gonna see if rats know the difference between natural cheddar and "I can't believe it's not cheese"!
Yep, our D-plus rests on furry little Shawn and Cory.
- You named them after yourselves?
- Yeah.
Shawn's the one chewing the lock.
I'm the one with the skin disease.
Keep your little vermin away from tomorrow's edition of the school paper.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go, all four of you rats.
Um all three of us rats.
Little Shawn broke out?
I got him, I got him.
He wants to kiss you!
Please!
He loves you!
Come on, you kissed my brother!
Hey, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I finally get a brainy girl interested in me, and you guys screw it up!
Oh, pull.
Hey, that floor's real slick out there.
Just Good.
Well, I gotta get home.
I promised Mom I'd crack her back before American Gladiators.
What are you doing, Cor?
Check it out!
Oh!
A screen full of Feen!
He's gonna be on the front page of the school paper?
Won't it scare children?
It won't scare 'em if he's - teeny!
- Oh!
This has definite possibilities.
- Let me in there.
- OK.
OK, new principal is beeny, deeny, geeny, leeny Ha!
"New Principal is Weeny"!
Can you imagine 2,000 students reading this?
Power ultimate power.
Yeah, but we would never - Would we?
- Power!
We'd be notorious!
We would be legends!
- What do you mean?
- Well, what are we now?
We are lowly seventh-grade sewer scum who name rats after ourselves to feel important.
And how do you feel about that?
Better than the guys with no rats!
Hey, Cor, wouldn't you rather be something special or would you rather be us?
Shawn, power like that in the wrong hands it's dangerous.
All right.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, wrong hands, wrong hands.
Hey, look at this.
His name's Feeny.
They wrote "Weeny.
" I'm laughin'.
You laughin'?
Oh, yeah.
I was just thinkin' of laughin'.
I would've been laughin' already but I was too busy listening to you, Harley.
But I think I'm ready now.
The guy who could cook up somethin' like that now, that's a guy I'd like to have hangin' with me.
He'd be a great addition to our organization.
Well, yeah.
He could stand right here.
I'm thinkin' he could stand right where you're standin'.
Well, then, where would Joey stand?
Oh.
Am I goin' for a ride?
Excuse me, Harley.
Sir, about that guy you wanted to meet Did I say you could eavesdrop on a senior conversation?
Did your little seventh-grade ears hear something they shouldn't have heard?
For your sake, I truly hope not.
Yeah, 'cause Harley's got a whole locker full of ears from guys who've done the same thing.
Their glasses hang crooked now 'cause they got no ears!
- How much to keep the ears?
- A buck.
Thank you!
Shawn, are you farther gone than I ever would've imagined?
No, no.
I'm not gone.
I've arrived!
I am known!
I rule this school!
My fame here will live forever.
Except nobody knows you did this.
What, you think that bothers me?
I know I did it, and that's good enough for me.
I wonder who did this?
If it was my boyfriend, I would do anything for him.
Oh, it's killing me!
OK, The Scarlet Letter Hester Prynne has a red letter "A" on her dress.
Now, everybody knows what the "A" stands for, right?
Boring?
Hey, everybody, don't laugh at Matthews, OK?
He's never seen an A before.
OK, the buzz is all over the Massachusetts Colony that Hester has taken the pure out of Puritan.
It's scandal.
It's gossip.
It could've come right out of today's headlines.
Ahem.
Mr. Feeny, good morning.
Actually, Mr. Turner, I've had better.
You see, I have been forced on this particular morning to go from room to room, asking anyone with information about this little journalistic prank to come forward.
Hmm?
I will go a lot easier on the perpetrator if he or she or they voluntarily confess.
No?
Very well.
I will now return you to your lecture on on the letter "A".
Keep up the good work.
Eric, my son, how was your day?
Oh, wow, that's pretty hysterical.
Yeah, I laughed at it myself.
My girlfriend, however, failed to see the humor.
She said her efforts at journalistic excellence have been forever compromised by my limited intellect and profound immaturity.
- And what did you say?
- I said, "Bite me.
" So, you're back on the market.
You'll find someone.
Dad, I was dating the editor of the school newspaper.
It was a status relationship.
It made me somebody special.
Eric, I think you're somebody special.
Oh, you have to.
You had me and you're stuck with me.
Well, that's true.
But sooner or later, love will softly sneak up on you and wrap you in its gentle embrace.
You forgot to clean out the garage.
And it's a beautiful thing.
Oh, look, George is on the cover oh.
Weeny!
Isn't that the greatest thing you ever saw?
- No.
- Second greatest?
It says "Weeny"!
- How could this have happened?
- I don't know!
Molly proofread the whole thing right before - Wait a minute.
- You're lying!
You have no proof.
You were the last one in the newspaper office before the disks went to the printers.
Cory, did you have something to do with this?
No.
I did not do this, nor did I do it.
Weeny!
It says "Weeny"!
I can read!
I don't understand this.
How can you what is there not to understa Molly, hi!
Get out of my sight, you vermicular miscreant.
So, how's it goin' with Molly?
There's no talking to her.
She's a vicious, humorless man killer who leaves nothing but a trail of misery and crushed hearts in her wake.
So, it's OK if I call her?
Jason, I'm through with women for my junior year, OK?
The next time you see me about to fall in love with some beautiful, heartless bag of misery, I want you to talk me down.
You got it.
And can I call her?
- Oh!
- Ugh!
- My shoes!
- Your shoes?
My shoes!
- I just bought mine!
- I just bought mine in New York.
- Oh, my pants!
- My blouse!
My hair My, my!
My, oh, my!
Uh, bag of misery, bag of misery, bag of misery.
Yeah, I know.
You're right.
I'm sorry I bumped into you.
I'll just get out of your way.
Oh, well, that's a shame, because my family just moved here from Atlanta, and it's my senior year in a brand new school, and I'm just so utterly, utterly lost.
- You're a senior?
- Misery bag!
- Senior!
- Old misery bag.
Look, I know.
You're right.
- Are you doing anything right now?
- No.
Well, then, you're gonna want to get these.
Desiree Emmeline Hollinger Beaumont, but you may call me "Desiree.
" Eric Matthews.
You may call me "Desiree.
" OK, a rumor was going around school that the "weeny" headline was just a typo that nobody did it, like I don't exist.
Check it out.
Now I exist.
I am somebody!
Oh!
What a beauty, huh?
Oh!
I snuck in early this morning and changed it.
Looks like the real thing, doesn't it?
Except for this drip.
Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, you're out of control!
Yeah, I am.
Tell your friends.
There's your man, Mr. Weeny.
Mr. Feeny, I did not paint this "W".
And the headline in the school newspaper?
- It wasn't me!
- Mr. Matthews, our own esteemed Janitor Bud placed you at the scene of the crime.
I seen him with my good eye.
- Well, that'll be all, Janitor Bud.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Out of my way, you little puke machines!
Scene of the crime?
Janitor Bud said he saw you and another boy toying with the computer after school.
Unfortunately, he didn't get a good look at your accomplice.
Mr. Feeny, I'm totally innocent.
My hands are clean!
Oh!
I didn't do it, I swear!
All right, then give me the name of the person who did.
I see.
Mr. Matthews, you have until the end of school tomorrow to give me the perpetrator's name.
Otherwise, you will be suspended.
Hey, how you folks doin'?
- Better than you.
- Mr. Feeny called.
He told us he's meeting with you in his office tomorrow.
He also said to ask you what it's about.
OK, look.
I am in this sort of a situation and I don't exactly know what to do.
Well, if you want to, you could talk to us.
'Cause we're gonna make you.
All right.
I've got this friend who's pulled a major scam at school.
- Shawn.
- Not Shawn.
- Shawn!
- Fine, Mom, think it's Shawn, because that protects the kid it really is.
- Anyway, this kid did something.
- With a newspaper headline.
Yeah, it could be.
Now, Mr. Feeny he knows I didn't do it, but he also thinks he knows I know who did do it.
- Shawn.
- Not Shawn.
- Shawn!
- Amy, he says it's not Shawn.
- I believe him.
- Obviously it's Shawn.
Well, I don't care who it is.
A friend does not rat out a friend.
What are you, in a prison movie?
There are consequences.
Oh, what's the worst that Feeny can do?
Well, he's threatening to suspend me.
Oh, great, a big red "S" on his permanent record.
Oh, nobody looks at that.
Who looks at that?
Some colleges he applies to.
Any college will let you in as long as you have enough money.
- Do we have enough money?
- No.
You have to rat out your friend 'cause we're poor.
What possessed Shawn to do something like this?
I don't know.
He just wanted to be someone special, and not some seventh-grade nothing.
Maybe when you get a little older and a little more mature, maybe you'll realize that stunts and gimmicks are not what make you special.
I'm dating a senior.
I'm special!
I am fabulous.
I have a tremendous newfound sense of self-worth.
- Nothing bad can happen, right?
- No, no.
Good!
Mr. Matthews, I trust you're not forgetting our 3:30 meeting.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
It was just a little prank.
Don't you think you're maybe taking it too seriously?
Ah.
You think I'm acting like a weenie, Mr. Matthews.
- Am I acting like a weenie?
- You know I didn't do anything.
But I know you know who did, and until you tell me who it is, the only person I can talk to is you.
- 3:30, Mr. Matthews.
- 3:30, Mr. Feeny.
- Did you tell him?
- What do you think?
- Thanks, man.
- You're welcome.
'Cause it was just a little prank, right?
And nothing else is ever gonna happen again, right?
Right.
It's never gonna happen again.
So, have you seen this?
A typographical error in our last edition incorrectly named the new principal as Mr. George Weeny.
" - Good, it's over.
- Read on, little buddy.
"His true name is " Weeny Weeny.
"Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny.
"Continued on page three, column one.
Weeny"!
- Are you completely deranged?
- Yes, I am.
- But I didn't do this.
- You didn't?
No!
Somebody ripped my idea.
I'll never be a legend now.
I'm laughin'.
I'm hysterical.
I'm rolling on the floor.
It has imagination.
It has daring.
It has a certain kind of flair.
You hear that, Frankie?
Harley says we got flair.
This was your work?
Well, you know how you said it was gonna be somebody else standin' here instead of me and Frankie standin' here, and, well, maybe it was just the motivation we needed.
We did it for you.
May I say that right now, I'm having a moment.
I wanna blow my nose on that kid.
Yo, kid, it's your lucky day!
Now, after school, you can drive me down to the mall, because I have no idea where anything is yet.
And while I'm investigating the finer stores, you can take my new kitten that Daddy bought me, and have him neutered.
Who's your little Georgia peach?
You are.
And who's my little Yankee Doodle?
I am.
Ooh, whoo!
On the cheek!
She's a senior!
Is that why you're getting neutered?
The cat's getting neutered.
Maybe you can get a two-for-one deal.
- Or am I too late?
- Hey, hey.
This happens to be a relationship between two complete equals.
Do you know, my little puff pastry, there's just a lick of winter in the air?
Would you mind, before picking me up, just drivin' around the block for 40 minutes while the heater's on, so the inside of the car's all nice and toasty?
Would you do that for me?
Say, "Yes, puddin'".
Yes I believe the woman wants puddin'.
puddin'.
Oh, you know, I hope that when I get a girlfriend, she respects me the exact same way she respects you.
And if I do, I want you to drive your car around the block for 40 minutes till the heater gets all nice and toasty and then I want you to run me over.
Would you do that for me, puddin'?
So, you gonna be shootin' some hoops today after school?
I can't.
I got this little meeting with Mr. Feeny where he's gonna ask me some questions about something I didn't do.
And if I don't tell him who did, I get suspended.
And I totally appreciate you doing this for me.
I mean, after I blew up that mailbox last year, Dad said one more screwup and he'd ship me off to military school.
You know, I can only cover for you for so long.
How long?
"Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, Weeny, "Weeny, Weeny and Weeny.
" Don't be late, Mr. Matthews.
Go easy on 'em, George.
They're at a new school.
As am I, Mr. Turner, as am I. So in the end, Hester Prynne is faced with a pretty tough decision, huh?
Does she rat on the person who's responsible for her predicament, or does she keep his secret and face the scorn of society?
Pretty relevant stuff.
Eh, Matthews?
Eh, Hunter?
Sir!
It stood for adultery, sir!
I was practicing for military school.
Matthews, hang for a minute, will you?
I can't, sir.
I've got a date with destiny.
You could be late.
What's Feeny gonna do, suspend you?
He's going so psycho over this, don't you think?
I think when you're new at a school like you and me, first impressions really stick.
They decide your reputation.
What if tomorrow you raised your hand and I said, - "What do you want, booger"?
- Would you do that?
It'd probably follow you all through high school.
Maybe all your life people would call you "booger.
" - Would you do that?
- I'm the teacher.
I can do whatever I want.
I wield the power to inform and to influence.
So do people who make funny newspaper headlines about the principal who's new in school, like you and me.
So you're saying I should squeal on my friend?
- No, I'm not.
- So I should cover for him?
- I'm not saying that, either.
- So, what are you saying?
I was hoping you'd know.
You're not really gonna call me "booger," are you?
I'll see how I feel.
Listen, about the headline and all well, I'm sorry for what happened.
Must've hurt being called you know.
Wasn't as if I never heard it before.
It was practically my nickname growing up.
Uh, that's not to leave this room.
I guess it's more of a big deal than I thought.
As principal of this high school, I'm expected to keep order.
Unchecked, these pranks undermine my authority and breed disrespect.
So I guess I get punished for something I didn't do.
Name the person who did, and you walk out of here scot-free.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
You thought about this, and that's your final decision?
Yeah.
You've decided that protecting a friendship is more important than the grisly punishment I shall now dispense?
Mr. Feeny, he didn't mean to hurt anyone.
He just wanted to do something that would make him somebody special.
Ah.
To be somebody special is a quality from within, Mr. Matthews.
To give you an example, I think it's a very rare quality for you to put a friend's welfare before your own.
But, just a second ago, you wanted me to rat on him.
As the new principal, yes.
But as your teacher, as someone who lived next door and watched you grow up I never expected it for a moment.
- So how long am I suspended for?
- You're not.
Detention for five days.
One day for each letter in "weeny.
" Which, in this instance, should properly be spelled W-E-E-N-I-E.
Shouldn't it, Mr. Hunter?
- You told him?
- What do you think?
I think you wouldn't.
I'm an idiot!
He refused to rat you out, Mr. Hunter, and he now faces a week of detention in your honor.
But the punishment for not being caught, Mr. Hunter, is far, far worse.
I did it, Mr. Feeny.
I confess!
I will be watching you every moment of your high school career.
Which, in your case, could be decades.
- But I just confessed.
- Too late, Mr. Hunter.
You are my new special friend.
Why didn't you turn me in?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
- That's Grapes of Wrath.
- Yes, it is.
- That's a real book.
- It's a two-pounder.
- And it looks like you're very near the end.
- Page 582.
I am impressed.
I'm impressed to the point of who-are-you.
And now I'm on 581.
You're reading it backwards?
Yeah.
See, this way, I already know what's gonna happen, which makes everything that happens before it make sense.
- What do you think?
- Pretty good.
Not as good as your idea of taking all 30 showers on the first of the month.
Yeah, I was too clean in February.
No.
I don't care what errand Desiree is sending you on.
You are gonna sit down and eat some breakfast.
You'd like that, if she never got her shampoo, wouldn't you, Mom?
Wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you?
What kind of control does this girl have over you?
The girl does not control me.
I control her.
Ha!
Ah, she needs conditioner.
Ooh!
I've lost my son.
Good thing I still have another son.
"Whenever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there.
Whenever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there.
" Boy, that came outta nowhere.
OK, we're talkin' about The Grapes of Wrath.
Who can give us an overview of what we've read so far?
- Muscle spasm, Matthews?
- No, sir.
I'd like to take a shot.
OK, everybody, give him room.
All right.
I think the conclusion of the book shows the Joad family's been pretty much destroyed by the greedy farm bosses, but the author's telling us they still have their dignity, and they're gonna fight on.
What just happened?
You're a disgrace to the entire back row.
OK, this story about migrant farm workers in the 1930s shows us that powerful people will exploit the powerless until they organize and stand up for their rights.
- Yes.
- Yeah, the thing about the 1930s - will we have to know dates for the test?
The date is not as important as understanding the historical context of the whole struggle for workers' rights.
Excuse me.
What page is the historical context on?
- Are you kidding me?
- We need to know that for the test, right?
No, forget about the test.
I want you to learn about this book to add to your personal knowledge, not to just pass a test.
I don't wanna hear anymore about the test.
What?
- Uh, when is the test?
- What did I just say?
OK, could I just ask one more question about the you know, the written thing you put a grade on that tells our parents we're idiots.
- There won't be any essays, will there?
- Matthews, as long as you read the book and open your yap during the class discussion, no test.
OK?
Now can we possibly return to what is important here?
No test.
My, my.
Your fourth-period English class is looking unusually chipper today.
You know, it's international day here in the cafeteria.
Nothing lights up a young face like a big bowl of hummus.
That could be.
But I wonder if it had anything to do with your innovative no-test policy.
What?
Oh, no, no, no.
It's not a policy.
I just made the kids a deal that if they do the work and learn this book, then I don't need a test on this book.
I don't think that's radical thinking.
Do you?
Oh, not at all, Mr. Turner.
In fact, why don't we take off our clothes and run willy-nilly through the woods.
If my kids know their stuff then why do I need a test to prove it?
How do you determine that they know their stuff?
Because I know my kids.
I know my dog, but I haven't a clue what he's thinking.
- You have a dog?
- Well, no.
You see, without the test, your students will come into class tomorrow knowing absolutely nothing.
Well, call me optimistic, but I think you're wrong.
Are you optimistic enough to try your theory?
- Try how?
- Try test.
- Give them the exam tomorrow.
- And what'll that prove?
It'll prove whether they really work when they believe they don't have to.
- And if they do?
- Well, then, I consider your methods.
- And if they don't?
- I'll consider yours.
Mrs. M!
Ooh, lookin' hot!
Didn't you just do a guest spot on Baywatch?
Thank you, Jason, but I think I'm just a little too mature.
Oh, stop.
I'll tell you, though - if they do the Next Generation, you're in.
Hey, Jase.
Hey, you're not shooting hoops dressed like that, are you?
No, I gotta bail on the game today.
Something kinda came up.
Oh, let me guess, and I'm just pulling this out of the air here - a certain senior girl named, uh, Vampira?
- Desiree.
- Oh, that's her day name.
- I have to go to the mall with her.
- You "have to"?
So she can show me what she wants for her birthday.
All right.
My condolences on the loss of your son.
Thank you, Jason.
And in lieu of flowers, please send donations to the foundation for the terminally whipped.
I really don't know why you two are so down on her.
Oh, is that your pager?
No.
Oh, let's see.
She has just pulled into the driveway and she would like a glass of water.
Eric, you go near that sink, and I will not be responsible for what I do.
I just wanna get her a Oh, man!
Next time, listen to me.
Oh, hello, Jason.
Over here doin' a little yard work?
Be a dear - run and fetch Eric.
Oh, jeez, Desiree, they didn't tell you?
Seems as though Eric was taking a bath and the pager went off.
Wasn't pretty.
They're zippin' the bag up now.
As a matter of fact, you should get outta here before the cops start asking questions, so - Jason!
- Oh, you're alive.
May I ask why you are wearin' a dish towel in your trousers?
Um, see, my zipper was hit by lightning, and my mom had to throw water on me to put the fire out.
- Do you believe me?
- No.
Now do you believe me?
Eric, come, play hoops.
I'm throwing you a lifeline here, boy.
Take it.
You play basketball?
Yeah.
Aren't you a little petite?
OK, that's it!
You and me, north against south, rematch, come on!
Without that accent, you're nothing, you Georgia peach!
Come on!
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?
Are you gonna let her talk to me like that?
Yes.
Fine.
Later.
I'm afraid you have a decision to make between your little elfin buddy and myself.
I am not elfin.
I am a human being!
All right, class.
In The Grapes of Wrath, we see that the struggle to organize, to get justice for the migrant farm workers, was long and difficult.
Heads were broken.
People were killed.
A lot of blood.
Sounds like Bingo night in my trailer park.
Now, like the Joads, we also find ourselves in the middle of a little struggle.
We don't want tests.
We think we can learn the material without 'em.
- Right.
- Yeah.
Now, the boss - or Mr. Feeny, in this case - doesn't believe us, so what we gotta do is prove to the boss that we can learn this book without taking a test.
- Right.
- Right.
And to prove that, we're just gonna answer a few questions on this piece of paper.
- It's a test.
- No, don't think of it as a test.
It's a survey.
- Survey says - Test!
- You gave us your word.
- I even read the book.
Yeah, my head still hurts.
So, why don't we just talk about the book, like you said?
Because I couldn't change the system overnight, Matthews.
Come on, work with me here.
I'm not taking this test!
- You can do that?
- I don't know.
Me neither!
Good morning, Mr. Turner.
Obviously I was wrong, and your students were so prepared that they managed to finish the test two minutes after the bell has rung.
Let me grade 'em, and I'll get back to ya.
Well, that shouldn't take long, considering that all of these papers are blank.
I guess that'll kill the curve.
Do you mean to tell me that your students refuse to take the test?
That's the decision they seemed to have made.
Are you out of your mind, man?
We had a deal.
I gave them the test.
Interestingly, they gave it back to me.
Well, of course they did, earring boy.
I realize that all you seventh-graders are delicate adolescent flowers just beginning your high school blooming.
And so I say this with utmost sensitivity: Take this test or die.
You just have to let them know who's boss.
- Is this fair?
- No!
- Have we been tricked?
- Yes!
- Take the test or die?
- Die!
Then we die together!
Organized, like the people in the book should've done.
- The first student union.
- Yeah!
Look for the union label If you are buying that coat, dress or blouse Remember somewhere our union's sewing Our wages going to feed the kids And run the house Oh, yeah, I can learn a lot from you, George.
Shut up.
Ah, St. Eligius.
George, come back, man.
All right.
They have demonstrated the power of labor.
Now let's show them what management can do.
Cave?
We're gonna cave?
You know, you seem amused by this display of defiance, Mr. Turner.
Oh, I am, I gotta say.
'Cause if I had done to me what I did to them, then I'd have done the same thing to me that they did.
Go to the board and diagram that sentence.
I can't.
Then trust me; with every tick of the clock, the courage is draining out of their defiant little souls.
- What are we?
- We are kings!
And what do kings say?
They say "no more macaroni"!
No more macaroni!
- We want steak!
- We want steak!
- And what do we want with our steak?
- Macaroni!
No, we don't like macaroni.
Oh!
- And as a side dish to our steak, lobster!
- Lobster!
Oh, you're right, George - they are quaking in their boots.
All right, fine.
So they have a certain pluck.
Yeah, 'cause if I had done to me what they had done - That's getting old, hotshot.
- Come on, George.
Why don't you just let them burn out?
You don't wanna break their spirit.
Please.
I have been an educator for 35 years.
I think I know how to relate to my students.
All right, this is your warden speaking.
So, you wanna play rough with George Feeny?
- Fine.
We'll take off the gloves.
- Uh-oh.
The seventh-grade dance is hereby canceled.
You can't do that.
I can do whatever I want.
I have the megaphone.
the entire football season Oh, no.
canceled!
- But that means - Yes, Mr. Hunter.
No cheerleaders.
No!
Shawn!
It's a strike - we have to make sacrifices.
But he's taking my girls.
Why can't we just sacrifice you?
Now, I would prefer you go back to your classes and take the test, but being a reasonable Joe, I am willing to offer you a one-minute window of amnesty, beginning You have five seconds four, three Wait a minute, everybody.
He can't punish the seventh-grade class if there is no seventh-grade class.
We're a union, remember?
And I say, starting right here, right now, our union is on strike.
Let's go, everyone.
We're walkin' out of school.
Look for the union label Is anybody behind you, my Shawn?
I gotta tell you, there's no one with us We're all alone here, I'm gonna bail - You'd better not - Yes, I am.
- Oh, no, no, no - Yes, yes, yes, yes - No, no, no - Yes, yes, yes, yes Mr. Turner, I now return you your students, sadder but wiser.
- What about Matthews and Hunter?
- For those two, I shall have to go nuclear.
- And that would mean?
- I shall call their mommies.
- Hey, how'd the game go?
- Oh, great, great.
- For the other guys.
- I'm really sorry.
I mean No, no, it was a good experience for me.
I actually got to play center.
Lucky for me, the center on the other team was my size when he was five.
Look, I've been thinking a lot about this, and I thought Wait, wait, just tell me, OK?
Next game, are you in, or do we find a permanent replacement?
- Hello, Eric.
- Hi, Desiree.
Oh.
And hello, Jason.
I didn't see you.
Listen, sugarplum, I hear they've opened a new mall right across from the old mall, and I'd love to go explore it with you.
Maybe we could go, say, Thursday?
But I play basketball on Thursday.
Can't we go some other day?
Yes but I would prefer Thursday.
Uh look, Jason, I Um I'll see ya on Thursday.
- Excuse me?
- No, excuse me.
But, see, we've been dating all month long, and I've been your willing slave, and you've gotten everything you've wanted out of this relationship.
What was I ever gonna get?
Oh.
Goodbye forever.
You are an idiot.
Yes, I am.
How come there's nothing on the news about our walkout?
I mean, why is every station covering that dumb missing-bomb story?
Young men, we just got off the phone with your principal.
- You held a strike over a test?
- You walked out of school?
What were you possibly thinking?
Well, thinking's not our strong suit, Dad.
I'm convinced.
Maybe what we did wasn't smart, but at least we stood up for our principles.
And what were your principles?
I remember something about macaroni.
Thank you.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Matthews, Mr. Matthews.
I'm Jonathan Turner.
I'm Cory's English teacher.
- You wear a helmet?
- I fall off the desk a lot.
You wanna talk to Hoffa and Costello?
Yeah.
I don't usually make house calls, but this all started in my classroom, so I thought I might step in and mediate.
You're not gonna bust their heads, are you?
- No.
- 'Cause I'm OK with that.
Mr. Turner, all we did was read The Grapes of Wrath.
And you know what we learned?
You have to fight for your rights.
That's why we went on strike, and that's why we're in trouble.
That'll teach me to read a book.
I guess this is what happens when the little guys try to stand up to the bosses, huh?
No, let me straighten you out, Matthews.
You threw a hissy fit and you walked out.
We went on strike.
You did not, because you didn't have the one thing you need to go on strike.
- You know what you didn't have?
- Mob connections.
A job.
You're just kids.
You're in school.
Your parents make you lunch.
You're not a migrant farm worker picking grapes.
You're just kids.
You sleep on sheets with little dinosaurs.
Rocket ships.
Look, I messed up too.
I should've taught you that you can only take action if you're prepared to take responsibility for those actions.
Mr. Turner, put yourself in our position.
- If you had done to you what we had - No, been there.
Don't Look, you're just two kids playing way over their heads.
OK?
Now, you can decide that you're still students and get back in school, where you're sheltered and protected, and abide by the rules that go with that.
Or you can go out into the real world and get an immediate test called "find a job or starve.
" Now, you wanna take that test, or you wanna take his?
They got us surrounded.
- I guess we'd better talk to Feeny.
- Yeah, I guess you'd better.
Face it, guys.
Feeny's not gonna go away.
I mean, he's gonna be all over your case.
You turn around, he's gonna be there.
Now that's scary.
You know you got a principal living next door?
It's not something we brag about.
George, you live next-door to Matthews?
It's not something I brag about.
What are you doing here, Mr. Turner?
I came to talk to the boys.
Turns out they have something to say to you.
Look, Mr. Feeny, we got it all wrong, because we read this book all the way to the beginning.
Really?
And I don't suppose you learned anything from it?
Well, we learned you're supposed to fight back against what you think is unfair.
And that's the parallel you drew from the Joad family?
They were out in the real world, and they knew they had something big to fight for.
And how do the Joads relate to you?
I guess they don't.
I mean, we're just kids.
- Yeah, we're not really out in the world yet.
- They had nothing to eat, nowhere to live.
All they knew was that they deserved a decent wage.
And all we know is nothing.
And wherever there's a guy who don't know nothin' I'll be there.
Well said.
It's from the book.
I actually read it.
I believe you did.
And I'll take that into consideration.
That'll be all.
You can go.
Well, Mr. Turner, I must admit they sound as if they actually know the material.
Yeah, and we found that out without giving 'em a test.
Oh?
You don't call what they just went through a test?
I'd call it a learning experience, Mr. Feeny.
Thank you.
Yes, well, that's what we're here for.
I'm alive again, Desiree's out of my life and I can play roundball with my buds any time I want.
Why aren't you dressed?
I shouldn't play.
I've been holding you guys back.
I'm just too petite.
- What was that?
- What was what?
- That.
- That!
That was my pacemaker.
In fact, I'm having a heart attack right now.
It's the pager.
You didn't answer my page, my little Raisinet.
I'm sorry.
It was all his fault.
Just be sure to pick me up in time for my pedicure.
Say yes, puddin'.
Yes.
I believe the woman wants "puddin'".
Puddin'.
What?
I'm only in it for the breakup kiss.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Why are they sending me these catalogs?
Geriatric Discount Warehouse?
I mean, this isn't Victoria's Secret.
What's New in Life Support?
How did I get on this mailing list?
- Have you sent away for something?
- No.
Well, maybe I sent away for some high-potency vitamin E - What's that for?
- For you.
It's a guy thing.
It makes you more durable.
Oh, really?
How much do you take?
All of it.
That is so sweet.
But it must've made them think you're a few years older than you are.
- Depends.
- Depends on what?
Depends.
46 diapers, $29.95.
Alan!
There's a picture of a guy waterskiing in them!
This couldn't be a "fear of aging" thing, could it?
- Oh, no.
Because I'm not aging.
- Neither am I. - Dudes!
Where are you guys off to?
- We're gonna shoot some hoops.
- You want some actual competition?
- Yeah.
Who do you know?
Can you be funny like that with a basketball stuck in your mouth?
Ooh.
I'd like to see that.
Listen, would you do me a favor and call these people and get me off this old fogeys' mailing list while I play a little b-ball with my homies?
Honey, what are you doing?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I can't move.
Am I the only one not moving?
All right, I'm gonna call the doctor.
I think you threw your back out.
Oh, no, no.
Never throw my back out.
I'm too young to throw my back out.
I got play some b-ball with my homies.
Am I outside yet?
Thus, the transcontinental railroad spelled the end of the Pony Express.
Mail service was faster, more reliable.
Letters no longer had to be passed from hand to hand.
These just in.
Ms. Wilder wants to know what Ms. Harrington thinks she should wear to her party.
Ms. Harrington wants to know what makes Ms. Wilder think she's even invited.
Ooh.
- I'm not invited?
- We'll just see, OK?
Mr. Matthews wants to know "Is this going to be a make-up party"?
Well, sure, Cory.
You can borrow my lip gloss.
"Out"!
Not "up"!
A make-out party.
Ah, so it is.
Mr. Matthews wants to know if this is going to be a make-out party.
Not for him.
I blew it, Shawn.
There's no way Melissa's gonna invite me to her party now.
So Feeny cut you off at the knees.
People will forget.
You'll get invited to the next party.
- You think?
- Yeah.
This is high school - too much going on to remember anything.
Don't think I forgot about you, baboon.
Don't think I forgot about last Tuesday- you sat in my chair in the cafeteria.
I'm sorry, Harley.
I didn't know it was your chair.
Everybody knows that's Harley's chair.
Everybody knows it's always been Harley's chair and it's always gonna be Harley's chair every year that he's a senior.
Ain't that right, Frankie?
What are you sayin'?
I like my sister?
No, no!
I'm not sayin' that.
I'm just sayin' you have a very close family.
- Hey, where ya goin'?
- I wanna call home.
- Is he gonna be OK?
- He's got a few issues.
I, on the other hand, have one issue - and that's you, baboon.
I don't like you.
I look at your face and I wanna hit it.
Is that so wrong?
So there I am, finals of the chess tournament, a mere three moves away from checkmate, and out of nowhere I swallow my rook.
Pardon me.
It's my 11 o'clock.
You know, I almost wish he did kill me this time.
How come?
Then I wouldn't be here to be humiliated when I'm not invited to the party.
You're sounding just a little bit whiney.
Shawn, this is the first party of our high-school lives.
I mean, it'll divide our class into two groups - those who were invited, the cool guys, and those who weren't, the geeks.
- You're losin' it, Cory.
- Yeah, I'm losing my whole future.
No one will talk to me ever again.
I might as well grow a hump and find a tower and ring the bell.
Don't worry, man.
There's always room on our couch for you.
I thought your Uncle Frank was on the couch.
No, not anymore.
He won the lottery and stopped talking to us.
- Really?
What did he win?
- Six bucks.
Don't look now, but the Pony Express just pulled into town.
Oh, no!
She's handing out the invitations.
Shawn, there's been a miracle!
Yeah, whatever.
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late for class.
Class?
!
We don't need no stinkin' class.
Our futures are set.
We are high-school gods.
Come, let us repair to the gym and rejoice in our invitations.
It's gonna be kinda hard, since I didn't get one.
- What?
- I didn't get an invite.
No biggie.
There's gotta be a mistake.
You're the coolest guy in class - you've gotta be invited.
Yeah, well, looks like I'm not.
- I'm gonna find out what happened.
- Let it go, OK?
Just let it go.
- You want me to ask her?
- Yeah, would you?
Hi.
I'm Cory.
- So?
- So you invited me to your party.
- What do you want?
- I think you made a mistake.
No, it's not a mistake.
You're really invited.
No, I mean about Shawn.
You forgot to give him his invitation.
No, I didn't.
He's not invited.
OK?
So what's the story?
Right, look.
From what I gather, in the last three seconds everything in the world has changed.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not sure.
I mean, Shawn, you're much cooler than I am.
- At least, I thought you were.
- Trust me, I am.
Then how come I got invited and you didn't?
So I really didn't get invited?
Unless it's a big surprise party for you.
I guess it's just one of those high-school mysteries.
Like how Janitor Bud lost his eye.
- Well, what are we gonna do?
- You're gonna go to the party.
I'm not goin' to a party that you're not invited to.
Oh, don't sweat it, Cory.
I'll go grab a burger at Chubby's.
- No, you won't.
- And why won't I?
Because I'm cool now, which means I run with a very influential crowd.
Which means all I do is pick up this telephone, pull a few strings and get you invited to the party.
Who are you gonna call?
Well, normally I'd call you.
Yeah, it tried to eat my money too.
You gotta kick it.
No, no, no.
Punish it, make it beg.
- Pretty good for the new teacher.
- Oh, you think so, huh?
- So how d'you think I'm doing so far?
- You teach English pretty good, and I guess that may come in handy somewhere down the line.
SÃ­.
Es muy importante.
But what's more important is what to do when you get invited to a party and your friend doesn't.
- How good a friend?
- Your best friend.
- How good a party?
- The best.
- What if you go without your friend?
- He says he won't mind.
- You believe him?
- I wanna believe him.
- 'Cause you wanna go to the party.
- Yeah.
Sounds like you've made up your mind.
What do you need advice from me for?
Look, you're new here, so you wouldn't know this, but I never really actually thought of myself as cool before.
- You never did?
- No.
So, now that people are saying I am, it kinda makes me feel good, you know?
Well, you should feel good, Matthews.
Just don't get carried away by what other people think.
Of course not.
Why not?
'Cause that wouldn't be cool.
Vandalizing school property, Mr. Matthews.
That'll be one day's detention.
I'll just keep this as evidence.
The Buddy Ebsen Low Low Impact Workout Video.
He's in here, George.
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Ah, Alan, there you are.
I was wondering if you'd care to join me for a little workout down at the health club.
What for, George?
For health?
Too late.
I turned 40, my back went out.
All I can do is lie on this couch and wonder how Angela Lansbury solves all those crimes.
- Oh, get up, man.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Quiet.
You're a disgrace to all men.
Amy, he's killing me!
All right, come on.
You don't even have to work out.
Just come down and sign up.
I get $50 for each referral.
Well, I'm only a school teacher.
Well, you may be in denial about your age, but I'm not.
I turned 40, my back never went out before, and this is a warning sign.
It means slow down, lie on the couch and listen to the hair grow in your ears.
Sorry.
Did all I could.
Throw some dirt on him and book a cruise.
Alan, the doctor says that the only reason you can't move is because you won't try.
Now, I am your wife and I have all the sympathy in the world for you, but if you don't get off that couch, I am gonna leave you for the first thing that moves.
Before you go, could you hand me that remote?
- That's it, that's it.
- Oh, no, no, please Yeah, yeah, come on.
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Mom, Dad?
It's not even dark yet.
Upstairs.
Do homework.
Sorry- it's Friday night, and there's a party out there that's just callin' my name.
Boy-girl, don't you know.
Oh, well, excuse me, Wilt Chamberlain but what party is this that I don't know about?
Mother, Father, there's a social event tonight at Melissa Harrington's.
Might I attend?
- Well - Let him go, Amy.
Cory, I'll pick you up in five hours.
- You will?
- Yeah.
I'm leaving right now.
What, are you crazy?
You swallowed that?
I'm taking no chances tonight.
I want this stuff in my stomach on reserve.
Why?
'Cause I'm going to a make-out party.
If I burp minty fresh.
OK, I guess if you think about it, it makes sense.
- Hey, where's my deodorant?
- In my pants.
You're sick.
- I'm cool.
- Since when?
Since Melissa Harrington invited me to her party.
- Who's Melissa Harrington?
- Only the coolest girl in 7th grade.
- And you got invited?
- I did.
- So that makes you cool too now, right?
- I believe it does.
Well, how about that?
I mean, you live with somebody and you think they're gonna stay a curly-haired little runt the rest of their lives.
Then you turn around and one day they're cool.
Wait, come here, let me look at you.
Whoa.
I mean, you didn't say you were this cool, Cor.
All right, knock it off, Eric.
You are so cool I'm gonna have Mom cut all the feet off your pajamas, 'cause you just may be ready, Mr Coolio Iglesias.
Huh?
If I'm so cool, I'm sure you wouldn't mind me using some of your very cool cologne.
Hey, stay away from my Rampaging Stallion.
What are you doing?
!
What's that smell?
Oh, my God, I'm rotting!
Relax, Dad.
It's just my Rampaging Stallion.
What do you think?
I think if the party doesn't have adequate ventilation, you're all gonna die.
- Mom?
- I think you smell very rampaging.
Now, be sure to thank Melissa's parents when you leave the party.
OK.
- Call Shawn, tell him we're on our way.
- Er, Shawn's not going.
- Is he sick?
- No, he's fine.
He just wasn't invited.
Well, why not?
I don't know.
I guess he wasn't cool enough.
But you are?
Look, I don't make these decisions about who's cool and who's not.
I just got invited to a party and I wanna go.
In fact, Shawn said to go.
I hope you know, Cor, that it's cool not to forget who your real friends are.
Look, just because I'm growing up doesn't mean I'm gonna change, OK, Alan?
Ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh!
Oooh-ooh-ooh!
Hi.
I'm Cory.
Good evening, Cory Matthews.
Welcome to my home.
I'm so happy you could be here.
Er You're welcome.
So, who's here?
Who's hot?
No one.
Hey, Alvin.
Hey, Simon.
Hey, Ubaldo.
Yep, the competition is pretty thin so far.
Looks like I'm the coolest guy here.
Yeah, rub it in.
I'm the coolest guy here Oh, no.
It's a geek party!
But they're just the first guys here, right?
I mean, the rest of us cool guys are coming later, right?
I wish.
Excuse me, there's a bug in the onion dip.
I know- I put it there.
OK?
Oh.
OK, thanks.
You know, I'm looking at your party guests and I can't help noticing that there's not exactly a cross-section of the student body.
My parents went over the guest list and took off all the cool guys.
So that's why you didn't invite Shawn.
Well, Shawn was the first person off the list.
See, 'cause Mom and Dad think that guys like Shawn are a little unpredictable.
Yep, that's us.
Unpredictable.
You never know what we're gonna do next.
Blaaaa!
Sometimes I'm so unpredictable I surprise myself.
I knew this was gonna happen.
Once Mom and Dad nixed all the guys like Shawn, none of the girls are gonna show up.
And since none of the girls show up, none of the regular guys come.
I can't believe my parents did this to me!
Well, it's a good thing you sneaked me in without them knowing.
Phew!
Hope they don't catch me.
Cory, my parents love you.
No!
Blaaa!
No!
They think you're a "nice young man.
" Oh, yeah?
Let's see how nice they think I am after I do this!
Cory What are you doing?
I don't know.
I'm way over my head here.
I knew it.
You're totally PA.
- PA?
- Parentally acceptable.
- That's bad?
- Well, it's as bad as it gets in high school.
- It's a girl!
- A girl came?
!
Get away!
She's not for you.
Oh, OK.
I came to tell you there's a really cool party going on.
Oh?
Where?
Excuse me, we're talking here.
Look, the wall.
- Later.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- You can't just leave your own party.
- Watch me.
- What about me?
- Oh, yeah, you When the chips are gone, the party's over.
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doin'?
We're practicing Spin the Bottle.
- But there are no girls.
- But there might be later.
Er, guys, I don't think any girls are coming.
- Oh, well, we don't mind.
- We're all friends.
- We like hanging out together.
- We're very comfortable with what we are.
Parties come and parties go, but you always have your friends.
That is why Ubaldo is so cool.
All right.
33 billion.
That's a new record.
Go carve my initials into that kid's head.
That's some score, Harley.
That's the best score I ever seen.
Nobody's gonna beat that score for, like, a million years.
Ain't that right, Frankie?
What are you sayin?
Sometimes at night I like to write poetry?
No!
I'm just sayin' that, you know Actually, I think that's kinda cool.
What are they, sonnets?
I gotta get me some better-adjusted guys.
- Hey, Matthews.
- Oh Hey, Mr. Turner.
What are you doin' here?
I stopped by for a Double Chubby Cheese, but the place turned into a mob scene.
Yeah.
I came by to find Shawn, but I guess he must've left already.
- No, he's still here.
- Where?
He's in the middle of the mob scene.
Your friend's a pretty popular guy.
Oh, no.
I gotta get out of here.
Why?
I thought you were here to see Shawn.
I was, but Remember that decision thing we talked about?
Yeah.
- I kinda made the wrong one.
- Yeah, I coulda told you that.
Then why didn't you?
Well, you don't listen in class.
You gonna listen in life?
But you're the teacher.
I'm supposed to learn from you.
Oh, right, right.
Teacher, teacher, yeah.
Hey!
Hey!
Everybody!
Hand in your homework, right now.
Shawn, your friend's here.
Just kiddin' about the homework.
Good night, everybody.
Oh, hey, Matthews You smell good.
Don't worry about me, Shawn.
I'm just leaving.
Why?
I got an order of chili cheese fries.
Extra gravy.
No, you're too busy with those other guys.
- What other guys?
- The other thousand guys at your table.
So they'll make room.
Shawn, they're gonna see you talking to me.
You know, you've been acting really weird since you got invited to this party.
You don't wanna hang out with me anymore?
I'm a geek!
Oh, like you didn't know?
Cory, what are you talking about?
I'm the worst kind of geek.
I'm a geek who didn't know he was a geek.
- Cory?
- Yeah?
- Do I hang out with geeks?
- No.
That's why I'm leaving.
Come on.
You're my best friend, man.
You just gotta loosen up.
- You don't think I'm a geek?
- Of course not.
- You think I'm cool?
- Of course not.
- Then what am I?
- You're Cory.
I'm Shawn.
Just like it's always been.
What else do you need to know?
I need to know how to be cool, like you.
I'm not cool.
Yes, you are.
Shawn, look around you.
I mean, this is the cool party.
You are the center of the cool party.
- This is the cool party?
- Yes.
- Let's bail.
- What?
This place is a zoo.
Let's bail.
Oh, I got it.
You're trying to teach me how to be cool.
Huh?
You're trying to show me that it doesn't matter where you go because if you're truly cool, wherever you go is the cool place to be.
Right?
- Cory?
- Yeah?
Shut up.
A very cool thing to say.
Oh, Alan?
Forgot to tell you, another catalog order came in today.
Oh, is it my truss?
Then what?
Oh, it's just a little something I bought for my next husband.
Oh, yeah?
Where is it?
Right here.
What do you think?
I think I'm regaining some sensation in my legs.
Think you can get upstairs?
Oh, I don't know, Amy, I don't know.
Because here's what's waiting for you.
Ooh It's a miracle!
I can walk.
I can walk, Sister Amy.
I'm healed!
Hallelujah!
- I'm so happy for you.
- Yes, I'm happy too.
Listen, before you move on to your second husband, I'd like to give that outfit a once-over.
Maybe a twice-over.
Ooh, you're not that young anymore.
Oh, yeah?
That's what you think.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
October the 31st, All Hallow's Eve.
I, Cory Matthews, leave this journal so that those who knew me can understand my terrible fate.
For tonight, at precisely 9:00, 8:00 Central, when the moon shines full, I will become the most terrifying of all creatures - the Werewolf.
Cory, what did you do to my duster?
8:35.
I'm drooling more than usual.
The change into wolfdom is upon me.
Hey, Cor.
You ready for the Halloween party?
Please.
I have no time for such things.
Come on, guess who I'm going as.
OK, I'll give you a hint - Wow, Shawn, I wish I was as cool as you.
I'm sure I have no idea.
I'm going as you.
Pretty lifelike, huh?
So where's your costume?
- I'm not going.
- But you have to go.
No, I have to stay here, alone, locked in my room where no one can see me.
What about Topanga?
She's meeting us here, remember?
No.
I told her it wasn't safe.
I can't be responsible for my actions.
Only evil will come from tonight.
Gonna make your move, huh?
If I do, it'll be on all fours.
Listen, I gotta tell somebody.
Shawn, I am one of the undead creatures of the night.
Cory, you can't fool your best friend.
Something's bothering you, isn't it?
Listen, what I'm about to tell you is so bizarre, no one in their right mind would believe it.
Then I'm your guy.
It all started last night.
Mr. Matthews, I wouldn't be taking out that garbage if I were you.
- I had to.
It was starting to move.
- Haven't you heard?
I haven't heard anything.
I live upstairs.
Well, it seems a wolf escaped from the Philadelphia Zoo.
Authorities believe that it may be somewhere in our area.
A wolf out here in the 'burbs?
Yes, probably looking for better schools.
So how come you're taking your garbage back inside the house?
Wolves have a keen sense of smell.
The garbage would only attract them.
So your plan is to lure them into your living room?
Scoff if you will, but as acting head of the Neighborhood Watch, I have duly warned you.
And that's when I heard the rustling.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Eric?
Eric and a girl?
Morgan?
Oh, boy, you're not Morgan.
Aah!
Ha-ha.
Come on.
There's no way you were bitten by a wolf.
Shawn, what else could it have been?
Look at the bite.
- I don't see anything.
- Of course you don't.
Everybody knows werewolf bites heal overnight.
Wow, then you're covered with them.
So you're really turning into a werewolf?
I didn't think so until I woke up this morning.
Eric, what's you're about to see may shock you.
Then put a towel on.
OK, look.
Oh, my God, I don't see anything at all.
Don't toy with me.
It's all over me.
I've got hair, huge amounts.
Yeah, you're right.
Where?
I've got hair on my chin, on my chest, and other places I don't see where having hair is really gonna help me.
Hey, you're right.
Look, little wispy hairs.
Congratulations.
You're going through puberty.
Least that's one explanation.
Eric, don't start with me.
I'm on the edge, OK?
It's just what you told me last night about being bitten by this wolf.
I didn't get a good look.
It might not have been a wolf.
Then it certainly wasn't an ordinary wolf.
I don't know, buddy.
One night, you're bitten by a wolf, the next day, you're the Chia boy.
I don't wanna alarm you or anything, but I think you might be turning into a werewolf.
Come on, who ever heard of a kid turning into a werewolf?
Oh, no one, except the most widely read newspaper in America.
Read this.
"Siamese Twins Eat Their Way To Freedom.
" Oh, no, above the fold.
"Teenage Werewolf Probed By Top Scientists.
" Mm-hmm.
Kid was on a camping trip, got bitten by something he didn't get a good look at, kinda like you.
W-W-What happened to him?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
He just turned into - a werewolf.
- This can't be true.
It's true.
Jason's cousin met a guy at a party who knows a guy who saw the thing.
They keep it in a secret, steel-walled room in the Pentagon, like this artist rendering.
It's already killed six guards.
Every full moon, they open this little door and feed it live rats.
Listen, I don't wanna hear about this anymore, OK?
I'm not a werewolf.
I am not a werewolf.
They say the first sign's denial.
Cory, breakfast.
I made you something special.
Mmm-mmm, big steaming bowl of rats.
Cory.
All right, I'm a hairy mess.
Get out your Epilady and just do me!
No, sweetheart, I was gonna say, "Don't forget your lunch.
" It's OK.
I'll kill something at school.
I sense there's something on your mind.
Well, it's this math problem I've been working on.
"If a werewolf leaves a train station going 40 miles an hour "and another werewolf leaves at 60 miles an hour, do werewolves exist"?
Is this about the wolf that escaped from the zoo?
Could be.
Cory, werewolves don't exist.
Relax, it's just a myth.
As you get older, you'll learn how to separate myth from reality.
What are you doing?
One of our soda distributors heard about this guy who robbed a jewelry store and made off with five diamond rings.
And he hid those diamond rings in five cans of soda, thus, your father and other grown-ups who can separate myth from reality - have been boosting soda sales.
- It's a three-carat diamond, babe.
I'm so thirsty.
Shawn, it's more than just hair.
I've got strange new urges.
Like last night, I'm watching the movie Untouchables.
You know the scene where Capone is about to smash heads - with his baseball bat?
- Awesome scene.
Except I'm not into it.
The whole time, I'm thinking, "I wonder how cold the water is on Baywatch.
" Jeez, whatever you got, you got it bad.
Yeah.
I didn't know how bad until lunchtime, when I had this strange craving for a snack.
Any special flavors?
Yeah, we got Bucket of Blood, that's like strawberry.
And we got Bucket of Guts, that's more or less chocolate.
And we got Smashed and Severed Intestines, but I don't recommend that.
- Can you mix the Blood and Guts?
- All the time.
A search for the missing wolf continues, and with today being Halloween, police report a number of prank calls from people claiming to have seen wolves and even werewolves.
Werewolves.
Isn't that silly?
Isn't it?
There are things, and there are things.
You mean there are things such as werewolves?
There are places where such things are revealed, for $5 complete.
Come with me, werewolf boy.
I give you my aunt on my mother's side, Madame Ouspenskaya.
The mysteries of the occult.
Madame, I bring you a boy whose soul is heavy with pain.
Has he paid?
Come to me, werewolf boy.
- How did you know?
- I know many things.
- I know you were bitten by a wolf.
- It's true.
- I know you're now becoming a wolf.
- That's amazing.
I know you are recently divorced.
What?
You're not Billy Joel?
No.
Well, then, you're just a wolf.
Yeah, but people turning into wolves that doesn't happen.
- It's just one of those myths.
- Myth?
I deal only in truth.
- Do you hear anything in this can?
- No.
Shoot.
All right, wolfie, listen.
You body's about to go through many changes.
What kind of changes?
You will develop the appetite of the wolf, a taste for things you've never eaten before.
Please don't say head cheese, 'cause I don't Then the pentagram, the five-pointed star, will appear in your hand.
- Is it gonna itch?
'Cause if it's wool - Shut up.
There is more, but it is too horrible to mention.
What about for another five bucks?
I feel chatty.
There is a girl who cares deeply for you, but when the madness of the wolf comes upon you, you will repay her love by killing her in a gruesome, evil manner.
I would never do that 'cause there is no girl who cares for me.
Go ahead, doubt someone who is licensed by the state!
You know what?
You're nutty.
I don't think I believe a thing you say.
I'm nutty?
You're 30 minutes late to your English class.
Aah!
And your underpants are riding up your tokhes.
That's amazing.
How does she do it?
OK, so we got these snotty little prep-school boys stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere no lamps, no cars, no shopping malls.
Not a single luxury.
Wait, I've read this book.
Matthews, welcome.
You were 40 minutes late, so we started without you.
I hope you don't mind.
No, it's OK, really.
What are we up to?
We got to this part where this really cool, but angry, teacher give this sweaty kid three days' detention for being unbelievably late.
Can I get a drink?
Back to Lord of the Flies.
Where were you?
There was a fortune teller at the yogurt parlor.
You tortured a fellow named Yogi Tyler?
Yeah.
I'll write you a note.
Matthews, you're amazing.
No idea what's going on, yet you're still taking notes.
What you writing?
What you eating?
You will develop the appetite of the wolf, a taste for things you've never eaten before.
OK, Matthews, step into my office.
You show up way late, you're eating paper.
Yet I think there might be something wrong.
I'm sorry.
I got some things on my mind.
I don't think you'd understand.
Oh, yeah, 'cause I was never 13, so I wouldn't get anything you could possibly be going through.
- Can I have my keys back?
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- What's this?
- It's the Pentagon.
- I got it this summer in Washington.
- The Pentagon?
The sign of the pentagram will appear in your hand.
The Pentagon or the pentagram?
Same difference.
Aah!
Hello.
Cory, are you OK?
I think I'm OK.
Feel my nose.
Is it cold?
If something's wrong, you can tell me.
It's not like I don't care about you.
You will kill the one girl who cares for you.
Listen to me, you can't care for me, OK?
If you do, only harm will come to you.
It'll never work out between us.
Cory, get a grip.
We're only going to a Halloween party.
Yeah, that's how it starts.
Then we get married, have kids and I eat them.
What kind of family is that?
Maybe you should take a nap before the party.
Farewell.
Think of me as I was.
Mr. Matthews, no running in the halls.
We are not animals.
Everything Madame Ouspanskaya predicted has come true.
And now only one part of the prophecy remains unfulfilled I gotta kill Topanga.
What a drag.
Girl finally likes you, and you're gonna off her.
You know, this could really hurt you socially.
What can I do?
My paws are tied.
Does anyone else know?
No, you're the only one.
The only one.
Hey, Cory, here's your supper.
- He's family.
- Listen.
Since you're going through this change, can I have your autographed Lenny Dykstra ball?
- Not my ball!
- Cory, you don't need it.
- You're a wolf.
- I can still fetch.
Listen, on the off chance that you are turning into this werewolf, why don't we head to the drugstore?
They've got that aisle, beauty aids.
If they got stuff that can take the 'stache off my mother, they've gotta have something for you.
Don't you think I already thought of that?
Listen, after school, I went back to Madame Ouspanskaya's.
Madame Ouspanskaya, everything you predicted has come true.
No kidding.
Mind if I use you for a reference?
I found out there is a girl who cares for me, just like you said.
- Well, have you killed her yet?
- No.
- Well, why not?
- I don't know.
Oh.
I know.
You will not kill her till the moon is full.
When will the moon be full?
According to USA Today, tonight at exactly 9:00.
You gotta help me.
Isn't there an antidote or something?
That's easy.
Wear a garlic necklace and get back in your coffin.
No, I'm not a vampire.
I'm a werewolf.
Tomatoes, to-mah-toes.
As long as you're not my son.
Listen, you gotta help me.
OK, OK, sit.
Good boy.
Now, "the only way to end the curse "is to be shot through the heart with a silver bullet fired by one who loves you.
" Couldn't I maybe just start with some vitamin C and work my way up?
Frank!
- What?
- A cigarette.
Hi, guys.
Morgan, that costume is so you.
My stuff.
Where is it?
Where's my Let's see, that would be wolfbane, silver bullets, gun.
Oh, the lady ahead of me took the last gun.
Fine, Mom, is that too much to ask for?
That you could take a minute and, oh, maybe save my immortal soul?
I guess not.
But, look, you got Morgan's gummie worms.
I'll share my worms with him.
Aw, that's very sweet of you.
I'll take care of this.
It's kind of a guy thing.
The crazy ones always are.
Is this silver?
Can I melt it down?
Cory, do you know what hormones are?
I could get five, six bullets out of this.
Do you know what raging hormones are?
Yeah, it's one of those rides.
Listen, Dad, you love me, right?
Yes, I do.
Where is this going?
I can't melt this down.
I'm just being crazy.
Here, throw this at my heart really, really hard.
You're going through some changes, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.
- You know what those changes are?
- Seriously?
No kidding?
- Yeah.
I'm a werewolf.
Ah-ooo.
Of course you are.
And if you misbehave as a werewolf, I'll be happy to shoot you.
But on the off chance that you're turning into a man and not a wolf, this could just be the beginning of adulthood.
Dad, I'm not becoming a man.
I'm becoming man's best friend.
Listen, just put some paper on the floor, and I'll get the hang of it.
Down, boy.
Remember when you were little and you watched me shave, and you wanted to shave, so I gave you a razor without the blade, and you put whipped cream on your face and scrapped it off?
Hmm?
Well, maybe it's time I gave you a real razor.
It wouldn't have to be very sharp, but, uh I don't know, how do you think you'd look with a beard?
Aah!
- Hey, where you going?
- It's happening, just like she said!
So I hope you will all forgive me as I cannot escape my destiny.
Fondly, Cory A.O. Matthews.
What's the A.O. stand for?
Ah-ooo.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking your running shoes.
If you don't have a four of a kind, there's really no point.
Cory, Topanga's here.
Oh, no, she's here.
Shawn, I need you to do something for me.
Promise me you'll keep Topanga away from me.
Swear by everything holy that you'll do everything in your power to keep that poor, innocent girl from a terrible Hi, Topanga.
Aah!
I'll just leave you two alone.
Have a good time.
Hi, Cory.
Topanga, I warned you not Oh, boy, why'd you have to wear that?
Because I'm a damsel.
But not the distressed kind.
One who's very together and in complete control of her own destiny.
Great.
Look, I think you're a terrific person, I like you a whole lot, and I never wanna see you again.
But, Cory, I don't understand.
Listen, everything you need to know is in here.
If it's ever published, I'd like the royalties to go to the ASPCA.
- Now out, out.
- But Cory Topanga, I'm not like the other guys.
I've got the needs and desires, and I'm not sure I can control them.
The moon!
When the moon is full, you will kill the one who cares for you.
You gotta get out.
Get out before it's too late.
It's too late.
OK, look at me.
Tell me what you see.
- I see you.
- No, you don't.
You see hair and teeth and the beast within me.
No.
I see Cory, the same Cory I've known since I was three.
I'm not a wolf?
I'm not a wolf, I'm not a wolf!
Yes, you are.
Mr. Feeny, you're putting your garbage back outside again.
- What about the wolf?
- Didn't you hear?
He was in the zoo the whole time.
They found him in the aviary, dining on a cockatoo.
So he never really escaped at all?
Funny how rumors start, isn't it?
Drat.
Well, good night, Mr. Matthews.
Wait a minute.
No wolf?
Well, then, what was?
Oh, it's you again, isn't it?
All right, come here, you creature of the night.
Come out, you demon beast.
Come out!
A rabbit.
A fuzzy, cuddly rabbit.
I got all worked up over you?
That's better.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Love sex slander.
Now even though Much Ado About Nothing was written 400 years ago, Shakespeare has captured raw human emotion in a way that is still riveting today.
Still has us glued to our seats.
You know these chairs really aren't the best for sleeping.
Oh, come on!
You got this innocent young girl and somebody says that she slept with this other guy, right?
And her reputation is shot and we think she's killed herself.
Now where are you going to find this kind of stuff?
- Melrose Place?
- NYPD Blue?
Barney?
My sister says he's gotten edgier.
Mr. Turner, we just can't relate to these characters at all.
- Why not?
- Because nobody acts like this.
Just because some guy says something about some girl, the girl wants to kill herself over it?
They say that stuff about Heather Locklear every week and she doesn't want to kill herself.
She's on the cover of TV Guide.
- You're right, Matthews.
- I'm right?
- No, you're exactly right.
- So am I done with my education?
Can I go?
In Shakespeare's day, the play's the thing.
In our day, I guess the thing is TV.
So maybe we should put ourselves on TV and ask ourselves what we think about love, sex and slander.
You mean interview each other?
- Kind of like a documentary?
- Exactly!
Hey, you know, my uncle Ralph was in a documentary.
They put a big blue dot over his face and changed his voice.
All right, the school's got video equipment.
Let's wear it out, OK?
We'll split into teams of two.
I want a video report.
Interview your friends, your families and each other.
Lets just see who's got the more mature attitudes - Shakespeare or us.
- Us.
- Really?
OK, my mature young friends, pick partners.
Uh, boy-girl pairs.
- Mr. Turner.
- Ah, Mr. Feeny.
- What's new?
- What's new?
Yes, what's happening?
What's shaking?
Whassup?
Oh, you know, teaching the kids.
Molding young minds.
What have you heard?
Word in the halls is that you have abandoned the teaching of English - in favor of sex, lies and videotape.
- Oh, well, you know, we give them these books that have these classic scenes of romance, yet we have no idea what's going on in their heads about sex and love.
Oh, neither do they, Mr. Turner.
You are fueling a fire you should be putting out.
You can't stop them from growing up, George.
You have given them a video camera and a license to talk to each other openly about sex.
That's growing up too fast.
This isn't our place.
It's our place to show them that classic literature still applies.
Show them then, by oh, I don't know, uh, teaching them.
Well, I think I can teach them better if they make the connection themselves.
Mr. Turner, in the matter of sex, I prefer they make no connection until they are out of our jurisdiction.
Don't you think that thinking is a little antiquated, George?
I prefer to think of it as classic.
It's just a little project, I think it'll be OK.
That's what Dr. Frankenstein said to all the curious villagers about his little project.
- Hi, I'm Topanga Lawrence.
- In Cory Vision!
Today we're going to be asking friends and family how they feel about love.
- Cory, what are you doing?
- What am I doing?
I'm adding style to our project.
You gotta move the camera.
Don't you watch NYPD Blue?
Subway Brooklyn squad cars.
Lots of cursing.
- Mr. Feeny - I don't wanna know.
Hi let me stop people in the hall to ask them what their personal feelings are about sex and love.
- Cory, there's nobody in the hall.
- OK, then, we'll interview you.
- Topanga, how do you feel about sex?
- Me?
Oh well, some people say, "Sex, great anywhere, anytime.
" - Who says that?
- Every boy in the world.
- Oh, yeah.
- To boys let's face it, sex is just a goal.
It's something they're after and they're not really sure why.
I think sex is a part of a special kind of love that you feel for a very special person.
Yeah, fine!
Now let's wake up the audience.
It's a chase scene Oh, yeah!
- We're going!
- Hey, hey, hey, Matthews, - what the heck you doing here?
- Oh, we're making a documentary.
It's about what everybody thinks about love and stuff.
Hey, that's cool.
What's it about?
- I'll show it to you when it's done.
- Can I be in it?
- You're in it now.
- You gonna ask me a question?
OK.
What do you have to say about men and women and huh you know?
OK.
Sex is very beautiful.
Especially within the confines of a loving monogamous relationship.
- Preferably marriage.
- That's really nice.
Hey, thanks.
Hey, is it all right if I say hi to my kids?
How do you know if you're in love?
Well, love is the most amazing, rare and precious thing in the whole world.
- Have you ever fallen in love?
- Five times a day.
Whoa!
Baboon.
Joey tells me you're shooting a documentary in my hallway.
Did I say you could shoot a documentary in my hallway?
- It's OK.
It's for school.
- Yeah, yeah school.
But nevertheless, here I see you shooting without the proper permits.
Permits?
Yeah, I think what Harley's gonna need here is a location fee - plus new equipment rental fee.
- How much is that?
- How much you got?
- Three bucks.
Three bucks.
But if you let Harley pound your face, maybe we could work out a discount.
Harley, you know, maybe we can avoid all this money and face-pounding if you felt personally involved in this project?
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying I'd put you in the film.
Picture it -Sex, starring Harley Keiner.
OK, baboon.
Make me a star.
OK, Harley, tell America - what do you look for in a woman?
Well, that's a very personal subject I have many thoughts on.
Joey, tell 'em what I think.
OK, Topanga, who are we talkin' to next?
- How about you?
- Nah, nah, nah I'm a behind-the-camera kind of guy.
- I'll run the camera.
- No!
I've established a visual style here.
I'm a serious artist.
No, no, no, don't tickle me.
- Then give me the camera.
- No, you don't have my vision.
Hi, Mr. Feeny.
Do you have an opinion on love and sex?
Yes.
My opinion is, not on school property.
Be careful with that valuable equipment.
What's more important, love or you know the other thing?
Love.
Love is the most important thing in the world, Matthews.
And love is the only thing that makes sex worth having.
Have you ever been in love?
Not yet, but it's something I'm hoping for and I know it'll happen.
So have you ever had you know the other thing?
What?
Have you ever had you know?
Because you said you've never been in love.
And if you had you know when you weren't in love then "you know" must not have been any good.
Who are you, Mike Wallace?
Hi.
I'm a romantic guy, so to me, love is very important.
And you girls will be surprised to learn that I'm currently available.
Yeah, good.
And if this was a dating service, I'd care.
Now talk about your attitudes towards love.
Oh, I'm in favor.
Mostly in favor of candlelit dinners - and long romantic walks on the beach.
- Answer the question.
- The question is, am I the guy for you?
- Cut!
- Now?
Hi, we're Cory's parents.
- Yes, we are.
Both of us.
And I'm Eric Matthews, the guy for you.
Here's the phone, two operators are standing by.
Call now.
OK, look.
Here's the deal.
I need you guys to be very mature about this and talk about - you know, s-e-x.
- On camera?
- It's for school.
- What the heck are they teaching you?
I'll go first.
I'll be very direct.
Sex is like voting.
It's a privilege that you may choose to exercise, when you're old enough.
- Go on.
- And you don't want to vote for somebody you haven't known for a really long time, or have strong feelings for, because you may be stuck with that person for quite a while.
Yes, sex is like voting.
You go behind a curtain, you do your thing, and then you get to do it again in four years.
Topanga, how do you feel about sex?
Me?
Oh, well, some people say, "Sex, great anywhere, anytime.
" Stop stop.
Rewind.
Listen, we have to make cuts on this.
Tell me what you think of this.
Topanga, how do you feel about sex?
"Great anywhere, anytime.
" I'll kill you!
You can't kill me.
I'm half your grade.
This is going to take all night.
Hi, Mom?
I'm at Cory's.
Yeah, I'm gonna have dinner over here, OK?
Yeah, they'll give me a ride home when we're finished working.
All right, bye.
This way they won't make me come home for dinner.
We can get this all done.
Pretty smooth.
Now watch the king.
Hi Mom, I'm at Cory's.
Ooh!
Hi, Mrs. Matthews?
Is it OK if Cory has dinner over at my house?
We're gonna work on the project over here, all right?
OK.
Bye.
Nice work, "king.
" All right, who's next?
Love is really great and it's even better if you love someone who likes you better than you like her, 'cause then she'll pay for stuff.
And if she's paying, love is way cool.
- That's disgusting.
- He's my best friend.
How many more tapes?
All right, what's this one?
You interviewed Janitor Bud?
What do the ladies respond to exactly?
It's the uniform.
A turn-on.
I can't explain it.
V.I. C. Oh, that's vomit in the cafeteria.
Gotta go.
Good luck with your show, honey.
You wasted video tape on this?
What are you doing?
Are you sleeping?
I'm not sleeping.
I'm right with you.
I hear everything you're saying.
- No you don't.
You're sleeping.
- I'm not sleeping, I'm just Just give me ten minutes.
I swear, ten minutes I'll be back, I'll be fresh.
Fine, I'll do this myself.
Honey, I just called Topanga's parents and there's no answer.
Maybe they're voting.
- They're probably bringing Cory home.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- OK, I'm gonna turn in.
- Mm-hmm.
- You wait up, OK?
- When he gets home, can I wake you up?
- What for?
- To exercise your right as an American.
Oh, that No, let me sleep.
But don't you worry, honey.
There's another election next November.
- Alan - What?
!
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Where's Cory?
- Uh, he must be in his room.
- Well, he better be.
I'm certain he is.
Wait, I'll go look.
- Mr. Feeny.
- Good morning, Janitor Bud.
Come quick.
Have I got something to show you.
Not another squirrel in the boys' locker room, I hope?
Better.
I tried poking them with my mop nothing.
You want me to spill some ammonia on their heads?
Ahem!
Five more minutes, Mom.
Good morning, sunshine.
Breakfast is on the table.
Today we're having a big bowl of sugar-frosted you've got a lot of explaining to do.
Yes, yes, they are both fine, Amy.
Now, be patient, you'll have your chance with them after I have mine.
Take care now.
Mr. Feeny, I gotta go change, I gotta go shower.
If you don't let me go home, I'm gonna be late for school.
Sit!
Now, the two of you spent the night unsupervised on school property.
Oh, Mr. Feeny, what do you think happ Oh, my God!
Mr. Feeny, nothing happened.
How could you think that?
- We're totally innocent.
Tell him, Cory.
- Oh, my God!
Mr. Feeny, we were working late on our documentary.
I fell asleep, then Cory fell asleep.
That was it.
Serious violations like this call for swift decisive action.
Uh While I decide what that is, you're both dismissed for the rest of the day.
- Mr. Feeny - Hmm?
Can we just keep this little incident between us?
Of course, Miss Lawrence.
Totally hush-hush.
No one need know at all.
- What's going on?
- You are a god.
- What are you talking about?
- Like you don't know.
Like you didn't spend the night with Topanga.
- All we did was edit.
- Hey you call it what you want.
- But you are the man.
- I'm not the man.
There's the man.
There he is, barely three feet high.
I mean, not much to look at, but inside there lurks a little Harley Keiner.
So uh so Matthews Come on, tell the truth now.
Did you sleep with her?
Did you sleep with Topanga?
Well, that's a very private, personal, intimate quest Hey!
Are you the man or are you just you?
I guess I'm the man.
Come.
Let us commemorate this occasion.
- This is not what I had in mind.
- Come here.
So, Mr. Turner, your little project seems to have spiraled totally out of control.
Who could have possibly foreseen that?
George, I think we both know what happened here.
Yes.
You have proven that our attitudes about sex have not changed for 400 years.
And that a rumor can still destroy a young girl's reputation.
Rumors can only exist when things aren't out in the open.
I was trying to get them to move from rumors and secrets - to honest, open discussion.
- You gave them an assignment about sex - and then you left them unsupervised.
- Yes, because I trust them.
- And was your trust justified?
- The assignment isn't in yet.
It was a terrible idea and I should have nipped it in the bud.
- What?
!
- Not you!
OK.
- They come down hard on you?
- My kids are grounded.
Listen, think you could sneak out for about a half an hour?
What are you kidding?
I'm under 24-hour watch.
Man, everybody's waiting for you down at Chubby's.
I'm telling you, you are a god!
Why is that, Shawn?
Why is my son so god-like and popular?
Because people have finally begun to realize how well brought up he is?
That the best you can do?
Yeah, well, my mom smoked when she was pregnant.
- Go home.
- Thank you.
OK, Mr. Popular you're on.
Look Dad, a lot of people at school have this wacky idea that more happened between me and Topanga - than happened to me and Topanga.
- What do they think?
- They kinda think I slept with her.
- Why do they think that?
Because technically, I did.
And technically you didn't bother to clear up this misconception?
Dad, they think I'm somebody now.
Guys who used to beat me up wanted to have their pictures taken with me.
Cory, Topanga's here to see you.
She's waiting in the living room.
Oh, OK, could you tell her I'm not here?
Oh, of course, that would be the right thing to do.
Topanga, he's right in here.
Son, if we stayed, would it be any easier for you?
- Yeah, it would.
- Yeah - Hey, Topanga, how you doing?
- Not great.
But I hear you're doing pretty good.
Look You know, people are gonna talk, but that's all it is, just talk.
And in a few days, they're talking about something else.
- It'll be like this never happened, right?
- You want me, Cory?
- What?
- You heard me.
You want me, take me.
Everybody thinks you did it already, so go ahead and do it.
- Come on, Topanga stop.
- What's the matter, Cory, - aren't you the man?
- Look, I just said what I said - because everyone wanted me to say it.
- Well, you know what I want?
I want my good name back.
Oh, well, you know, some people might argue that Topanga's not the best name to begin with.
You know what I mean, Cory, and I hope you know how I feel.
I feel like you used to be a good friend and now Now I don't know what you are.
But I don't like you.
OK.
Everybody settle down.
Settle down, it's show time.
First up, the tape by Topanga and Matthews.
Ooh!
- You're in this class?
- I'm in the movie.
- Mr. Turner, a word?
- Mr. Feeny You here to watch the tape?
No, actually I'm here to express my surprise that you're going to watch the tape.
Any chance you might rethink that decision?
All right, class.
Mr. Feeny's of the opinion that our discussions about sex and love and gossip and slander can only lead to more sex and love and gossip and slander.
I have to say, so far he's right.
Now, I have not seen this tape, but I hope my trust has not been misplaced in you guys.
Has it?
Why don't you ask him?
Matthews?
I think if we don't watch it, we'll never know anything.
My student says we should show it.
Well then, perhaps we should.
What is the most important advice you have for teenagers about sex?
Be careful with that valuable equipment.
Cheap editing trick.
I think sex is part of a special kind of love that you feel for a very special person.
Love is the most important thing in the world, Matthews.
And love is the only thing that makes sex worth having.
Sex is part of a special kind of love.
Love is the most amazing, rare and precious thing in the whole world that you feel for a very special person.
Hi.
Look, I didn't want to be in this documentary because I didn't have that much to say about sex and all.
- What's this?
- The Special Director's Cut.
And the reason I don't have that much to say about sex is because I don't have a lot of experience in that area.
Some people think I do, but I don't.
And if I let people think that I had some experience with someone, well you know, it really isn't fair to that person that I didn't have the experience with.
Well, perhaps this project is gonna serve some purpose after all.
- I'm shocked.
- Me too.
So I'd like to say, I'm sorry to that person and I should have acted more mature.
You know, maybe we haven't come as far as we'd like to think in the last 400 years.
OK.
Cut it, Shawn.
Stop the camera, Shawn.
- OK.
Now tell her how much you love her.
- Shut up.
I do not.
Then why would you do this for her if you don't love her?
Because she's my friend.
Will you stop the camera, Shawn?
Shawn!
Friend?
Friend.
When we read these books in class, it seems to me that the authors construct scenes of love which to me, do not seem based in reality.
Well, what's your idea of reality?
A moonlit night.
The back seat of my Chevy Impala.
And the lilt of some sweet girl's voice whispering in my ear "Hey!
You're crushing my cigarettes"!
That's love.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hi, my name is Cory.
The seventh-grade dance is Friday night, - and I was just wondering if you maybe - I'm sorry.
My grandmother's sick.
Any luck?
Apparently, it's not a good time to be a grandmother.
Look, her grandmother's coughing phlegm, her grandmother's hacking blood, and her Whoa.
I happen to know she has no grandmother.
Yes, and somehow she blames me for her death.
At least you can't sink any lower.
Hey, you.
Busy?
You're not gonna ask me to the dance, are you?
What if I did?
I'd say pick me up at eight, but no slow dances.
- Just watch these for a second, all right?
- I can do that.
I'm not going to this dance with anybody.
Why don't you just ask Topanga?
I could, I could, but that would show no personal growth if I simply ask the girl I've always asked ever since we were five.
- So, when you gonna ask her?
- I figure tomorrow, unless by some magic, girls suddenly start to notice me.
Hi.
I couldn't help noticing you.
Oh, you're talking to me?
Shouldn't you be at the hospital visiting one of your many blood-hacking grandmas?
- Why didn't you tell me you play?
- Huh?
Cory, they're onto us.
They've spotted our axes.
They know we play.
They like musicians.
Oh, well, then watch me pull this rabbit out of my hat.
Musicians.
Oh, well, that's very different.
- You guys in a band?
- Are we in a band?
- Are we in a band?
- Yes, you idiot.
Well, maybe you'd play for us sometime?
Yeah, we're gonna tell our friends we know you.
You know, they like us because they think we're in a band.
- We could cash in on this.
- But we'd be total phonies.
- Phonies with groupies.
- No.
We could never pull this off in a million, billion, trillion years.
- Wow, you guys have roadies?
- Boy, time flies.
Good evening, Philadelphia!
- Cory?
Hey, my old guitar.
- Yeah, Shawn and I need it for our band.
- You're starting a band?
- Not really.
Oh.
- You know, I used to have a band.
- You had a band?
Oh, yeah.
Back then, music was our main means of expression.
Social protest.
We sang about freedom of speech, fighting the establishment, the war in Vietnam.
I'm in it for the chicks.
I see where you're coming from, kid.
Amy.
Cory and Shawn are starting a band.
- To meet chicks?
- Why did you say that?
- That's why you started your band.
- Uh-uh.
No, Amy, our band was about the music.
- What did you guys call yourselves again?
- The Tongues.
And if memory serves me correctly, you were quite a big fan.
I was young.
I had no taste.
Wow, this brings back memories.
Alan, don't go there.
It was a very long time ago.
Amy, these were some of my best friends.
We were soul mates.
Friendships like that last a lifetime.
I wonder if they're still alive.
So, are you guys gonna be playing today?
Today?
No, we never play today.
We'd love to hear you play.
Won't you please play?
- OK.
- Excuse us.
Shawn, I don't know what's in your guitar case, but I have an egg-salad sandwich in mine.
Cory, they wanna see us play.
Look at the pretty girls.
- Why can't we play?
- Because we don't know how.
Well, that would stop us.
Sorry, girls.
At this moment, we're not performing for the public.
- Our managers won't let us.
- Oh, why?
Because we're still getting over the death of our drummer.
- Oh, won't you please play?
- OK.
- Cory, everybody's talking about you.
- They are?
Yeah.
They say you're starting a band?
- They're awesome.
- Except they don't have a drummer.
- Who are you?
- We're with the band.
Cory, I wanted to talk to you about the dance.
Jeremy asked me.
I told him I wasn't sure, and I wanted to see what your plans were.
You know what?
If you want to go with Jeremy, it's fine.
Don't worry about me.
I'm covered.
OK.
Maybe I'll see you there.
Cory, when do we get to meet the rest of the guys in the band?
- What guys?
- The guys.
The guys I told them about.
Oh, and I want to meet the guy that plays the guitar with his teeth.
Oh, the teeth guy.
- Well, he's at the dentist right now.
- Oh!
Cory, I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but we're gonna need some guys.
My mama left me before I was born - No.
- I'd make you look bad.
- Yeah.
- Next.
My mama left before I was born Ahh-ahh-ah-ahh So let me understand this, Thor.
All you do is pose?
Well, yeah.
What else is there?
He's shorter than me and he won't steal our chicks.
You're in.
Now, you gotta have a guy like that.
All right, guys, if this band is gonna succeed, we gotta follow one rule - No matter what happens, no matter how cute the girl is, no matter what she's wearing, we never, ever play a note.
- And why is that, Shawn?
- 'Cause we don't know how.
Wow!
Hey, now, this looks like a band.
That's what we're goin' for.
You think I'd look cooler not playing the guitar or not playing the drums?
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, some idiot down the street was selling this at a yard sale.
He didn't know what he had.
I bet his wife did.
Honey, it's just fun.
You know, when the guys come over Friday.
An amp, a couple of guitars We probably won't even play.
Here you go, Dad.
- It's just fun.
- Oh, this fun just keeps piling up.
Yeah.
Picked up your jacket from the cleaners.
Oh, cool.
My band jacket.
- You guys actually wore those?
- Oh, yeah.
This was our look.
Did people laugh?
No, they were impressed, especially your mother.
Her name's sewn right in the sleeve there.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, what's with the other names?
"Paula, Bethany, Ashley " Uh, those are the small towns we played in northern Pennsylvania.
- You're lying?
- Yes, I am.
Hi, Cory.
What are you doing?
I was just standing here, listening to the music in my head.
Wow.
Is it loud?
Sometimes it drowns out my thoughts, but then I see you and I know it's our song.
Ooh, that was a good one.
- Pretty smooth, Matthews.
- Oh, hey, Mr. Turner.
- I didn't know you were standing there.
- Oh, yeah.
Maybe you better turn down the music in your head.
You know what, Mr. Turner?
- Me and you, we're a lot alike.
- Are we?
Yeah.
Because you have this motorcycle helmet, people think you're cool.
And I carry around this guitar case and people think I'm cool, too.
Matthews, I got this motorcycle helmet so if I crash my bike, my head doesn't go splat.
- Why do you have that guitar case?
- To protect my sandwich.
It is with deep, deep regret, I must inform you that the Demon Seeds have pulled out.
Aww.
Now, now, steady.
You'll still be able to shake your little booties.
I have managed to secure a more-than-adequate replacement - the cool, mellow Caribbean sounds of JoJo Man and Brother B. Ohh.
- We want live music.
- "Recorded live at the Fiesta Room of the Montego Bay Hilton.
" - Just get another band.
- Yeah!
Hard as it is to believe, my rock 'n' roll contacts are limited.
- Cory and Shawn have a band.
- They're really good.
Yeah!
Mr. Matthews, you have a band?
- Well, yeah, but - They're really great.
I've heard them.
No, you haven't.
Cory and Shawn!
Cory and Shawn!
Well, Mr. Matthews, you seem to have quite the following.
So, what's the name of your jolly group of music makers?
Our name?
Um they call us The Exits.
Well, kudos.
You have a gig.
- Have your people call me.
- Wow!
We'll get to hear you play in front of the whole school.
Shawn, look who they got to play the dance.
- The Exits.
They're great.
- They're us!
Ooh, they're not so good.
How could you book our band for the dance?
Shawn, I couldn't help it.
Sonia was all pressed up against me and making little purring noises in my ear.
What about our band credo?
Remember "we never, ever play"?
We have to play.
Feeny booked us and I may have possibly signed some papers.
But it's OK.
I mean, we're all in this together, right?
See ya.
OK.
OK, OK.
Now, don't panic.
We'll just play the old hits, none of the new stuff.
Maybe one encore, we're in the limo, and we're home.
- OK, what are we gonna do?
- We have to find some way to go on.
The girls love us.
Yeah, we worked too hard to get where we are.
We have to come up with a plan.
You know, that's that's so crazy, it just may work.
- What may work?
- The plan.
I didn't tell you what it was.
That way, they can't get it out of me.
Get what out of you?
Nice try.
So I bought two cemetery plots.
Now, I figure I'll subdivide later.
I'll let 'em bury me standing up.
What the heck do I care?
I'll tell you, I'm not going anywhere soon.
You know why?
My cholesterol is ten.
Listen to you guys, talking about cemetery plots, cholesterol.
I mean, we were The Tongues.
Ooh, wow, live dangerous.
You want dangerous?
- I cheat on my wife.
- What?
!
No, no, I mean, I go to the grocery store, I peel the "fat free" sticker off the Entenmann's angel food cake, I stick it right on the box of the double-fudge, double-butter brownie balls of death.
I bring it home, I say, "Look, honey, fat free.
" She's eating celery.
Guys, what are you talking about here?
I mean, remember those wild times we had together?
Remember remember in Scranton with those triplets?
- No.
- Sorry.
OK, guys, what do you want to drink?
My boys will have some brewskies, right?
Actually, could I have some mineral water?
- Diet iced tea?
- Would it be too much of a hassle to run a few carrots through the juicer?
I'll have a beer.
Thanks.
Coming up.
- Sure you wanna do that to yourself, Alan?
- Yeah, man, you got kids.
- Hi, Dad.
Bye, Dad.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey Where are you guys going looking so cool?
- Our first gig.
- Your first gig?
You just started playing two days ago.
- Kids learn fast today, Alan.
- Not mine.
- Well, we gotta go.
Bye.
- Break a leg.
Yeah, that's our backup plan.
Must make you proud, having your son follow in the old man's footsteps.
Oh, yeah, it sure sure does.
Whoa!
What's this?
- Ooh, is that your old Strat?
- Oh, you bet it is, man.
I took it out, tuned it up, hit a couple of licks.
I gotta say, it's like I never put it down.
Oh, this is a beauty.
I guess your wife threw your ax out a long time ago, huh?
- No, it's in the van.
- Mine, too.
- Yeah, mine's in the trunk.
- Hey, you wanna get 'em?
- Sure.
- Go get 'em.
Come on, we'll jam a little bit.
Hey, The Tongues!
How about that, Amy?
We're gonna play.
The boys are back.
This better not be to meet chicks.
Check.
Microphone one.
Test Test.
George, keep talking.
We need more.
Stay in school.
Get a good education.
Don't slouch.
George George, you are killing the mood.
Good.
This place is packed.
We're dead.
Wow, look at all the girls.
So many pretty girls.
You know, maybe we can play.
Shawn, we can't.
That's why I got those guys who can play to come and save our butts.
We just strum and pose.
Hey, guys, cutting it kind of close, but you made it.
And now, are you ready to rock 'n' roll?
Depends.
What's this gig paying?
Uh nothing.
Too bad.
We got a paying gig at Rodney's Oyster House.
- See ya.
- This is the end of the world.
OK, man, you guys set?
I'm ready to intro you.
- We're not going on, man.
- What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what he's talking about.
He's talking about the lack of respect for artists.
You see this turkey?
This turkey is pressed.
We were very specific that the band only eats fresh hand-carved turkey.
No fresh turkey, no music.
You got it, guys.
John Adams High, it is with great pleasure I give you The Exits!
Oops, my mistake.
- Now what?
- All right, just be confident.
We've got the guitars.
Everyone believes in us.
All we've gotta do is believe in ourselves, OK?
Right?
Let's go.
Whoo!
Good evening, John Adams High!
Are you ready to rock?
Are you ready to roll?
Are you ready to rock 'n' roll?
!
Good night, everybody!
I was feelin' so bad I asked my family doctor just what I had - I said, "Doctor" - Doctor Mr. MD - Doctor - Doctor "Can you tell me what's ailin' me"?
Doctor I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yes, indeed What I really need Good love - Gimme, gimme some love - Good love - Got to have that lovin' - Good love - Gimme, gimme some lovin' - Good love Got to have that love, good love Good Cory, if we want to get out of here with our lives, we better sing something.
It's OK, it's OK.
I've got an idea.
Hey, you there, what's your name?
You stink!
No, I think your name is Sonia, and I've got a song for Sonia.
Sonia, Sonia bebonia, banana-fana fafonia Fee-fi-fafonia Sonia!
Drive safely!
- That was great.
Thanks.
- Hey, let's do it again next week.
Yeah, let's go to my house.
Whaddya say?
- Hey, Alan, we'll see you there?
- Hey, you might!
We could start playing some clubs together, you know.
- Yeah!
- We can go out on the road.
Yeah, go now.
Go on Get on the road.
- I'll catch up with you, all right?
Go on.
- Yeah, yeah Goodbye!
Get out.
I thought you guys sounded great.
They sounded great.
I didn't sound so great.
What happened?
I used to be good.
Alan, darlin', I say this with love and respect.
- You were never good.
- What are you talking about?
You said it was my music that attracted you to me in the first place.
- And you believed me?
- Well, yes, I based my life on it.
It was never the music.
It was just the whole package.
What package?
You.
You were cute and you looked very adorable with your little guitar.
It didn't matter that you couldn't play very well.
- I just liked you.
- I can't believe this.
All this time, I thought you liked me because of my music, and you just liked me because of me.
I feel so cheap.
You wanna feel really cheap?
You know, there was one point there where I thought we really had them.
They were screaming, "Exits!
Exits"!
Shawn, they were looking for a way out.
Oh.
Here comes Feeny.
I can just hear him now.
"Messieurs Hunter, Matthews, "although right now you feel beaten and humiliated, "you've learned a valuable lesson "that you should never try to be someone you're blah blah blah blah.
Blah.
Blah.
" Messieurs Hunter, Matthews Mr. Turner.
Were we as bad as we think?
You guys don't show up for class on Monday, I'll understand.
Let's get outta here.
Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a sec.
You're still here.
Yeah.
My date wanted to go to the Oyster House.
- So, how come you didn't go with him?
- I was enjoying watching you.
Come on.
We were horrible.
We stank.
I played the name game.
- I didn't think it was so bad.
- Really?
- You liked the way we played?
- Maybe it was more the package.
You look so adorable up onstage with your little guitar.
You were just cute.
- So you didn't get to dance, huh?
- Neither did you.
- You wanna?
- Sure.
Greetings from the Fiesta Room.
My name is JoJo Man, and this is Brother B. Are you ready to party?
You with the mustache, what's your name?
George Feeny!
Feeny, Feeny fofeeny, banana-fana fofeeny Me-mi-momeeny Feeny Hey, Cory, how'd your gig go?
Awesome.
How about you?
- Words cannot describe it.
- Cool.
You know, since you're starting a band and all, I thought you might like to have this.
No, Dad, it's your guitar.
You keep it.
- No, really, I want you to have it.
- No, I won't deprive you of your memories.
Cory, somebody's gotta take this guitar.
- Eric!
- Eric.
Oh, son.
You know, this has so many memories for me.
Take it, will you?
Thanks.
You know I've actually been thinking of starting a band?
- Yeah.
- Right.
Nah.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Seven minutes in heaven?
Yeah.
They pick a boy.
They pick a girl.
Then they send you two into a dark closet.
- Well, how do you find the girl?
- With your lips.
I'm gonna like this game!
Yeah, if that's what you're eatin' for lunch, I don't think the girl's gonna like it.
- Nobody's talkin' to you!
- Just tryin' to help!
OK, look.
Closet strategy is the key.
You've only got seven minutes, and you have to make every second - What are you doing?
- Lip-ups.
I want to be in shape.
I want to go the distance.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
- What?
- Time bomb.
Just ignore him.
Please.
He's just playin' some game.
But, doesn't work.
Never has, never will.
- George, George, George!
- What?
Who dat?
Don't look, don't look!
Now look.
Mr. Turner, we are not in high school!
Well, yes, we are, but we are teachers, you fool.
Teach me about her.
Oh, that's Miss Tompkins.
She replaced Edwina Munsey in our social studies department mercifully.
- Did you hire her, George?
- Yes, I did.
Attaboy!
Take a shower, son.
You said "Miss.
" You didn't say "Ms. " or "Mrs. " That was an "iss," as in "Iss must be my lucky day.
She is, indeed, single.
She is also highly intelligent.
That's OK.
Mr. Turner, I frown upon faculty becoming involved with faculty.
Then it's not a policy.
It's just a facial expression.
Go ahead.
Skip blindly into the minefield of extracurricular romance.
Thanks.
I'm just goin' over to say "hi.
" Welcome her to our school.
How's my hair?
Long.
- Cory.
- What?
What Eric said, it's not bothering you, is it?
No, not at all.
In fact, I'm going over there right now and tell him how much it's not bothering me.
- Hi.
- Cory!
What a surprise.
What time bomb, Eric?
You can't just walk by me and go, "Tick, tick, tick.
" What's that supposed to mean?
Look, I'm just concerned you're not prepared for the make out party tonight.
- I know how to kiss.
- You think it's that simple?
I mean, what happened if she has braces?
What happens if your noses hit?
What if a hanger hooks you like a large-mouthed bass?
Do you even know what to do with your hands?
No!
I-I-Is that important?
Look.
Some things you can learn, but some things, it's it's already too late.
- I've got time!
- No, you don't.
You ate the beanie weenie casserole, right?
Tick tick Oh, my gosh!
Why is that bad?
Cor, deep down, does the thought of kissing somebody make you tense up?
- Absolutely not!
- OK, then.
All right, all right.
I wouldn't say "tense up," but I would say I become very alert.
OK.
So you'll be there at the make out party, very alert, you intestines full of beanie weenie, you lean in for a kiss, and you fly across the room.
This is great.
All the girls brought their lips.
Shawn, there's a girl with braces.
What if I get her?
She could cut my tongue and I'll bleed all over my shirt.
Oh, no.
Sally's wearing wool.
I'm allergic.
What if I sneeze in her mouth and pop her lungs?
Relax, man.
Have a snack.
Carbo load for the big race.
With bean dip?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you worried about, your breath?
My breath!
I didn't even think about that!
Oh, man!
I'm gonna kill 'em comin' and going!
I'll blow us both out of the closet!
I'm gettin' out of here.
- Hi, Cory.
- Hi, Topanga.
Boy, what a great party, huh?
I was great.
I was in the closet 14 minutes.
I'm gonna go home and ice my lips.
Cory!
Eric was right.
Too much can go wrong.
Cory, chill.
You're gonna be fine.
And you know why?
'Cause right up until the second you go into that closet, I'm right here with you, no matter what.
'Cause it's Cory and Shawn, Shawn and Cory.
- Shawn and Melanie.
- See ya.
All right, kids.
Now, time's up.
Come on, come on.
No overtime, no extra innings.
Is that the shirt you went in with?
No.
Cory, the closet is your friend.
No, it's your friend, Shawn.
I'm gonna choke.
Who will be next?
Could it be Cory and Oh, no.
That's me.
Maybe he'll pick me twice - and I can go into the closet with myself.
- Topanga!
- Cory?
- Huh?
Are you OK?
It's been a couple of minutes - and you haven't said anything.
- This is stupid.
It's pitch black.
How am I supposed to kiss you if I can't even see you?
- Hi.
- Hi.
You know, this is crazy.
How am I supposed to kiss you with this blinding light in my eyes?
We don't have to do anything you don't want to do.
I wanna do what everyone else is doing.
So, you're just doing this so you won't be different.
I'm just trying to survive this.
Oh.
No, it's not you, Topanga.
It's me.
I just can't perform under all this pressure.
It's OK.
Relax.
This happens to lots of guys.
How do you know?
Well, you know, girls talk.
Oh, man.
Listen, when you talk to girls, this did not happen to me.
Nothing happened.
I mean, something happened, but Whatever was supposed to happen, did.
- Cory, do you wanna just talk?
- Could we?
So, what would you like to talk about?
Well, we could talk about what we're gonna tell them when we get out of here.
- We could tell them we made out.
- They'd know.
I could mess up my hair and you could change your shirt.
You'd have to smile a lot.
And you'd have to get that real sleepy, stupid look.
You could change your shirt, too.
Don't push it.
How come you're being so cool about this?
I don't know.
Because you're nice.
- Great.
Twist the knife.
- I meant it as a compliment!
Guys don't wanna be nice.
We wanna be you know, tough, and good with appliances, and good kissers.
Well, there's really only one way to be a good kisser.
- You have to practice.
- You think?
Yeah.
So either we can start messing up our clothes and trying to look stupid, or Or You could just relax and kiss me.
- Or, I could practice an hour a day on - Shh.
Time's up!
Let's take a look at 'em.
So did you kiss anybody tonight?
- Mom - Amy, whoa.
Step away from your son, please.
- Why?
- You can't do that to a guy.
Oh, he's not a guy.
He's my baby.
Oh, please, please, please.
Have mercy on the boy, will ya?
How do I put this?
Do you want grandchildren?
Huh?
Well, then, don't talk like that to your son.
Go on, get out of here.
Give the boy some privacy, will ya?
Later, you and me, details.
So, studly, what happened?
Tell me.
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.
You won't need it.
- Nothin'?
- Less than.
Were you the only guy at the party who didn't make out?
Well, Alvin had a rousing asthma attack and had to leave early.
But other than him, the cheese stood alone.
Cor, I want to say that in this, the darkest hour of your youth, I'm trying very hard not to laugh.
Nope, can't do it.
Eric, it was a huge party.
There was a lot going on.
- I-I'm sure no one even noticed.
- Uh-huh.
Ladies and gentlemen, the Amazing Lipless.
I'm OK.
Life goes on.
Here, drive this through my brain.
It's OK, Cor.
I think it's only a few guys that know, and it's not like they're gonna tell everybody.
Yeah.
Yeah, nobody else will know.
Hey, Cory, listen, uh if you ever need to talk about, you know, anything, I'm always available, OK?
OK?
I've sunk so low that even teachers feel sorry for me.
Look, in situations like this, it's like my uncle Ralph always says, "It's not what you did.
It's what they can pin on you.
" - So you're saying I should - Deny.
Deny everything.
Hey, you were in a closet.
Who else knows what actually went on in there?
Just because he didn't kiss me doesn't mean he's some kind of freak.
No.
No!
Make her stop!
Look, all of you.
Any guy can just crawl in a closet and kiss a girl, but Cory's different, because he is a really nice boy.
Well, I'm a nice boy, Shawn, and now everybody knows it.
Hey, baboon.
I'll just be over here.
Over here.
There's an inspirational thought I'd like to share with you.
"I cried because I had no shoes, until I met a boy who had no lips.
" That's a good one, Harley.
That's a great one.
I'll be laughin' at that one for years.
I'll be tellin' my grandkids about it 60 years from now.
Unless I don't have grandkids.
Then I'll tell some kids in the park, - and the cops will come and say - Shut up!
Look, Cory's obviously depressed, so why don't you just leave him alone?
Over here.
W-Why do you even care about nothings like us?
'Cause you seventh-graders are my little ant farm.
I watch you work and play and run through your tiny tunnels, and when I hear that one of my little ants is gettin' his legs ripped off well, I can't miss that.
And here I thought my life had no meaning.
Glad we could brighten your day.
So, Miss Tompkins, everyone making you feel welcome here your first week?
Some more than others.
This Jonathan Turner guy- what's the deal with him?
It's really not my place to comment on one teacher to another.
Oh, come on.
He asked me out.
I just wanna know if he's an ax murderer.
It wasn't on his resume.
I was just wondering, is he the safe and sane type, or is he more of a dangerous, rebel loner?
If pressed, I'd be forced to say he's more of the latter.
Excellent!
As much of a rebel loner as one can be living with seven maiden aunts above a lace and linen shop.
Come on.
He's a wild thing.
No, no, no, no.
He is extremely cautious.
He always wears his helmet when he's on his motorcycle.
Oh, is that his Harley out in the faculty parking lot?
No, it's mine.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
You have been so helpful.
- Believe me, it was unintentional.
- Don't worry.
We're just having dinner.
And if it works out, I owe it all to you.
I'm never going back to school again, OK?
I've made up my mind.
- I don't want to discuss it.
- All right.
So Noah had his paste cup, and he reached over - and took your paste cup?
- And he ate it.
And Mrs. Brookholder wouldn't give you another paste cup?
No.
She's a witch.
- Sweetheart, I think in the future- - It's paste!
My entire high school career crashed and burned today, and you would rather talk about paste.
Would you like to discuss it now?
I choked at a make out party, OK?
Eric told me I'd choke.
He warned me I'd choke, but like an idiot, I went to the party anyway.
Oh, Cory.
Your first parties with girls are always a little awkward.
Awkward?
Mom, this wasn't awkward.
Losing your gym shorts while climbing the rope- that is awkward.
And it burns!
This was beyond humiliation way beyond.
This was this was agubois.
Agubois?
It was so bad, I had to invent a word for it.
Eric said I'd choke, but did I listen?
No!
Aside from agubois, the key word in all of this seems to be "Eric.
" Oh, so you noticed that, too?
What's with Cor?
I think he snapped.
I'm gonna go now.
What did you say to Cory before this party?
I probably said, "Have a good time.
Thank your hostess.
" Eric, look.
You're not in any trouble here.
We want to know what you said so we know what to say to him to make him feel better.
Oh, OK.
Told him how scary it was gonna be to kiss a girl.
- And he bought it?
- Oh, he totally freaked out.
I was just playin' with his head.
I mean, you know.
Oh, man.
You are in such trouble.
B-But you said before that I wasn't gonna- I was just playing with your head.
Sit down.
You know, Eric, Cory sounds so upset.
He isn't gonna feel like going out with girls for a long time, and I think you should stay home with him.
No, you can't do that.
I'm just coming into my dating prime.
And yet, if I were you, I'd be looking for other interests.
Homebound activities, my friend.
Because, until Cory feels like going out, I don't see you going out at all, either.
I'm too cute to stay home!
Hey, Cor, how you doin'?
Just dandy.
Sitting here, planning out the rest of my life as a nice boy.
Look, Cor.
I may have slightly exaggerated the dangers in kissing a girl.
Forget it, Eric.
I'm never gonna date again.
No, no.
See, you have to date again.
You have to date again real soon.
What's it to you?
You're my little brother.
Your pain is my pain.
If you're sitting at home on a Saturday night, it's like I'm sitting at home on a Saturday night.
- You gotta get back out there, man.
- I'm not ready.
Did you feel ready when Dad took the training wheels off your bike?
No, and I wasn't.
I lost six baby teeth and scraped off half my face.
Exactly my point.
See, you just needed your training wheels on a little bit longer.
You need a no-pressure date to get your confidence back.
No, there's no such thing as a "no-pressure date.
" I will take you and a girl someplace so unromantic, nobody will want to kiss anybody.
- You're gonna take me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?
- You're my little brother, remember?
Your pain, my pain OK, fine, but who do I take?
I mean, no one's talking to me but Shawn and Topanga.
- Take Shawn.
- No, Topanga.
You animal.
- So, what do you do at this place?
- They drink coffee and they read poetry.
You can't possibly get into any trouble here.
Good luck.
Hey, look.
Uh, they've got, uh, cap-noo-see-no.
I'd love a double decaf latte with skim milk.
Clearly you have knowledge of other worlds.
I'll go find us someplace to sit.
This is for all my friends who choose to remain anonymous.
"Poem of the fierce and bloodthirsty samurai warrior.
"Cherry trees are blooming.
On the third evening, the last flower dies and falls.
" Thank you.
Hey, Frankie, that was really good.
I mean, you started slow, but you got 'em at the end.
All right, you got that out of your system?
Let's go.
Hey, Frankie, I got a lot out of that, 'cause you put a lot into it.
I mean, everybody here liked it.
Hey, didn't you like it?
- See, you got a fan.
- I don't do it for the fame.
Well, that's not what poetry's about, you know?
Poetry's about complex human emotion, like, you know, whatever.
Harley, you go to poetry readings?
What, you don't think I'm a sensitive guy?
I should slap you around for that.
Cory, over here.
- You know, I like this place.
- Why?
It's friendly.
It's homey.
There's just something about it.
- It's not a closet.
- You noticed that, too.
You know, Cory, you weren't the only nervous person in that closet.
- No way.
- No, really.
All those people outside, listening, waiting Yeah, but you girls have it so easy.
You just have to stand there and wait to be kissed.
- Oh, please.
- What do you mean, "Oh, please"?
Speaking as a girl, we don't know what we're doing, either.
Does anybody else know about this?
You're the first person I've told.
So, in the closet, if I had kissed you I wouldn't have known.
I was worried about where my hands would go.
Oh, I could have helped you with that.
Well, too bad we missed our chance.
Let's welcome our next word painter, Donovan.
I call this one "The Photo Session.
" Lights.
Peaches ripened in the sun hot and sweet.

Mr. Turner, over here.
There's a place right here.
You want me to sit here?
I just assumed you were looking for a seat.
Oh, no, no.
That's fine, thanks.
So, Mr. Turner- Jonathan- Johnny how goes it?
Fine.
You know, I had dinner with Katherine last night.
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, man, what happened?
Did you like her?
Did she like you?
Are you gonna see each other again?
Give me the skinny!
Curious, George?
- I set you up, now give.
- No.
- Hi, guy.
- Hi, Kat.
See you tonight.
I like her.
I'm telling you, it's a new breakthrough in dating technology.
You made out at a poetry reading.
Oh, I love poetry now.
In fact, I'm thinkin' of becoming a poet.
There once was a boy named Cory who now has an interesting story.
- He learned about kissing - and all he was missing when he and Topanga made out!
Shawn, can you say "summer school"?
- Hi, Cory.
- Hi, Topanga.
- Well, see ya.
- See ya.
Ah, when are they gonna leave me alone?
I call this one "Canned Food Aisle.

Cory?
Cory!
Eight seconds, Mom.
Open the door.
My bags are tearing here.
All right, four seconds.
Gee, thanks for your help.
What are you doing?
I'm nuking my socks.
It's this new idea I have, 'cause I like putting on warm clothes.
I was gonna start with my underwear, but I was a little nervous.
Could you, uh, help me out here, please?
Yeah, sure.
All right.
I got the celery.
I got the peanut butter.
- What are you doing?
- I'm dipping.
No, you don't do that.
That's a new jar.
Oh, well, the old jar had celery in it.
You were such an adorable child.
I have pictures.
How did you get like this?
Get like what?
What?
So, my Mom says, "Why don't you try being polite for just one day, and see if people don't notice"?
Hey, for what it's worth, Cor, I think you're polite.
Then again, polite in my family means wearing a tie for your arraignment.
I appreciate your quick response with the fire extinguisher, Mr. Mendoza, but in the future, please, wait for a fire.
Oh, bless you, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, thank you.
Mr. Matthews, that's surprisingly considerate.
Good.
Tell my mother.
Oh, now watch as I shift into turbo polite.
- Eric, allow me.
- OK.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
No, I'll take it from here.
Thanks.
All right.
Tell Mom I offered.
- Aah!
- Hey!
Oh, sorry.
You OK?
I don't know.
Whoa, twice in a row!
- You're a very polite fella.
- Thank you.
And your smile, it's kinda engaging.
Yeah, I use the toothpaste with swirls.
Humorous, too.
You got posibilities.
Turn around.
Let me look at you.
Well, I don't usually go for Velcro-heads, but on you, I don't know.
It's workin' for me.
- You got a name?
- Uh, Cory.
I'm Theresa.
My friends call me T.K. Oh, nice to Oh, gosh, I knew this was going too well.
Chill.
It's a pen!
Keep in touch.
- All right, Cor!
- That girl she wrote seven numbers on my hand.
- What could that possibly mean?
- It means call her.
Shawn, how can I call her when I don't even have her Oh!
You know, last night, T.K. and I talked on the phone for, like, two hours!
It beats my previous time with a girl by, like two hours!
She even asked me out to the movies this Friday night.
She asked you out?
Yep.
And I just might let her take me.
All right, homeroom, announcements.
Uh, stay awake.
Chess squad.
All students interested in trying out for the fast-paced world of " Yeah.
Um, let's see, jumping to relevant stuff Due to a freezer mishap, fish kebabs will not be served in the cafeteria today as scheduled.
" Thank you, thank you.
I don't want to know.
Uh, "Item 15 " - Hey.
- Hey back.
Ah, there he is.
There's my guy.
It's funny, I got this thing here called homeroom Yeah, this note covers it.
T.K., what are you doing in my homeroom?
Our homeroom now, sweetie.
OK, Theresa, welcome aboard.
Pick yourself a desk.
Mr. Turner, is it OK to sit two to a desk?
I'm thinking, no.
For a five-spot?
Welcome home, Cory.
Your wreath is here.
Wow, look at that.
Yes.
That alone would have been excessive but wait, there's more!
Your very own life-sized candy clown!
Whoa.
Can I play with him?
Sure, and then you can eat him!
Why can't life always be like this?
- And now it's time to tell your parents - who's T.K.?
She's this girl who kind of likes me.
- No kidding.
- And I have you to thank, Mom.
Wait, how are you pawning this off on me?
Well, you told me to be polite and considerate of others.
So yesterday, a girl dropped her book, I picked it up, and boom, I'm in a relationship.
I'm in one, too with this guy.
- Tony, you're back.
- More stuff for the kid, Alan.
Sign here, right under your other three signatures.
Believe me, I know the routine.
"With love, T.K." Cory, what's with this girl?
She's very sentimental.
You know, flowers, candy Sirloin steaks?
Nothing says "I love you" like a beautiful piece of meat.
Tony, please!
Cory, this girl's trying to buy your affections.
- So let her.
- Do you mind?
Alan, you should know me well enough to know when I'm kidding.
Cory, I think this girl's comin' on a little too strong, a little too fast, and Man, these'll barbeque great!
- Alan!
- What do you mean, too fast?
Cory, I think this is something we need to sit down and discuss.
She's right.
Listen to your mother.
I'll go fix us a nice piece of steak.
I'll find the way.
They sent a wreath?
I specifically told them roses.
Time's up.
He'll call you back.
Look, T.K., it's really all right.
I mean, I got the steaks and the candy clown.
The fuzzy yarn head made me think of you.
You know, you really don't have to keep sending me these things.
'Course I do.
You're my guy.
Makes me feel ladylike.
Put Tony on!
Tony, wreaths ain't roses.
Do I gotta come down there myself and straighten you out?
What are you - Oh, it's you.
- It's always me.
Listen, I'm so I'm so very, very sorry.
You like that, Frankie?
I bump into this guy, and he apologizes.
That's polite.
Isn't that polite?
Wait a minute.
You're saying you bumped into me?
That's how I saw it.
His fault entirely.
I only hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Yeah, but what about your shirt?
Oh, that's no big deal.
There's plenty more like it.
Hey, you, shirt Come on.
Come on.
Hey!
Some things I deliver myself.
I'll get my coat.
You'll walk me home.
Hey, Cory.
How you doin', man?
- Cory?
- That's you name, ain't it?
Yeah, but usually as you're shoving me out of the way you call me "baboon.
" That was then.
This is not then.
Have a nice day Cory.
You, too Harley.
Man, this politeness thing's really catching on.
Ah, Mr. Matthews, just the man I wanted to see.
Perhaps you could tell me the meaning of this masterpiece?
"T.K. loves C.M." Now, what could that possibly stand for?
Well, I think someone named T.K. apparently loves, um corn muffins?
Would you like to take another shot at that, Mr. Matthews?
No, sir.
That was the best I could do.
See you in detention?
Yes, seems unavoidable.
- Very subtle.
- Shawn, she's obsessive.
She's crazy!
What's gonna happen to me?
Just relax, Cor.
Tell her to slow down.
Your date with her tonight cancel it.
So, you like my artwork, fuzzy?
I'm having a matching one tattooed right over my heart Uh, no, no.
Please.
- Look, about our date tonight - Oh, it's all set.
I got the movie tickets, made the dinner reservations It's under the name "fuzzy.
" - Um, tonight's not good.
- OK.
Tomorrow night.
Look.
Theresa, I think you're a really, really nice person You're gonna bail on me?
No.
I just need some time.
Oh, I understand.
I understand that no matter how much you give to some people, they're still gonna turn around and stab you in the back.
You know, I thought you were different, but you're just like every other guy I've ever met.
I'll see ya.
Shawn, she was really upset.
Maybe I should go apologize.
No, no.
This politeness thing is pulling you down, man.
Till the whole thing blows over, go rude.
Listen, I'm-I'm sorry.
I was teachin' while you were talkin'.
- My mistake.
- No problem.
Guys, while you're here in my class, whatever personal stuff you got goin' on, check it at the door.
Hey, yo, you, Mr. Turner?
Yeah, Janitor Bud wants to see you down in the parkin' lot.
Somethin' about his truck runnin' over your motorcycle.
My bike?
Oh!
Read poems.
OK, everybody out in the hall.
Let's go.
Move it along.
No talking.
Single file.
Everybody but you, baboon.
Frankie, you and Joey watch the door.
- What's going on?
- I am extremely distraught.
Do you happen to know why?
Yes.
Someone has stolen the sweet, angelic smile from the face of my sister Theresa.
Your sister?
- You mean, T.K.'s - Theresa Keiner.
And nobody breaks the heart of Harley Keiner's sweet baby sister.
Look, Harley, I swear, I had no idea she was your sister.
You do realize you'd be dead already, except that Theresa says you're a gentleman.
Lucky for you and your kneecaps, I deem this a very rare and desirable quality.
Therefore, I am willing to let you take Theresa to the movies tonight as planned.
You know, we really don't have to go out.
No, you really do.
OK.
This will be a nice date, a polite date.
You will be a perfect gentleman, 'cause otherwise, baboon, your next and final date is with Frankie.
And don't expect flowers.
All right, I think this'll work.
Black shoes, white socks, bow tie should do it.
Eric, how do I look?
Like a ventriloquist's dummy.
Perfect!
You know, I thought you had a date, but apparently, you're going to Sears to take pictures for Grandma.
This is for my date.
We want to make sure he's totally unappealing to this girl.
That's good.
Play your strengths.
Oh, gosh, she's here.
Shawn, stay with me.
Come on, what the worst thing that could happen?
It is time.
I got a date with Frankie!
Miss Keiner's waiting in the car to go to the movies.
Oh, that's better.
No, it's not.
Shawn, she's gonna see through this outfit.
I'm goin' out in a bow tie.
I'm coming back in a box.
Help me.
Miss Keiner doesn't like to miss the coming attractions fuzzy.
Any last words for Mom and Dad?
Tell Mom, "Politeness kills.
" After you.
- Hey!
- Frankie, I'm datin' here!
Well, I'm chaperonin'.
Will you talk to him?
Sure.
He always listens to me.
So, uh, Frankie nice hat!
- Shut up.
- Yes, sir.
Frankie, be a good guy, huh?
Go play on that swing set over there.
This I cannot do.
Ooh, the dancin' snacks!
I love the dancin' snacks!
Here make a dream come true.
Harley gave me orders.
Ooh, the Snowcaps are doin' the cha-cha!
I think they're savin' the last dance for you, Frankie.
Out of my way!
Well, alone at last!
You know, T.K., I'm really thirsty.
I think I'll go grab us a couple of drinks, OK?
Oh, save your strength.
You just sit there lookin' good.
But lose this.
Shawn, how'd you get here?
I live on the other side of the fence.
So, how's it goin'?
Shawn, she's all over me.
How do I get her to stop?
I've never exactly had that problem before.
How do you normally strike out?
I don't know.
I mean, it's usually so easy for me!
OK.
Look, hop on my bike.
I'll get you out of here.
Ditch Harley Keiner's sister on a date?
Are you mental?
Too late.
So, where were we?
Oh, yeah.
Uh, wait, wait, wait.
Couldn't we kinda talk?
OK.
Let's talk about you and me.
No.
Let's talk about something else, like - like, baseball!
- I hate baseball.
Mad about the strike, huh?
Let it go.
You know, me and my brother Eric, we went to, like, 10 Phillies games last year.
What's the matter?
Theresa?
Look, I was at a Phillies game once, and I didn't have a good time, OK?
Well, what happened?
You wanna know?
Yeah, I wanna know.
OK.
You'll get a kick out of this one.
My old man, my real dad, you know?
On my eighth birthday, he took me to a Phillies game.
And it was so great being there, just me and him.
He even arranged it so my name flashed on the scoreboard.
That's really nice.
Yeah, it was till he started chatting it up with this redhead in the row behind us.
He acted like I wasn't even there.
Seventh-inning stretch, he and she went to buy some beers.
I never saw him again.
Wait a minute.
You're eight years old, it's your birthday The jerk ditched me.
I mean, I sat there for hours like an idiot with my stupid souvenir hat till one of the ballpark guys called my mom.
She was sort of under the weather, so Harvey rode his bike down to get me.
Who?
Harvey, my brother.
He's the only one who's ever really looked out for me.
Wait.
You're telling me Harley Keiner's real name is Harvey?
I'm the onlyone who gets to call him that.
Harvey the single most fantastic thing I've ever heard.
And I can't tell anyone, 'cause he'd kill me.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Yeah, he would.
Whoa, what are you doing?
- I like you, Cory.
- Yeah, I like you, too.
Well then, come on, kiss me.
Look, I'm sayin' it's OK!
No.
I just think we should get to know each other.
You know, get to be friends.
Slow it down a little.
I'm not that kind of girl.
- Aah!
- What are you doing with my sister?
Look, Harvey, I can explain everything!
Well, you better make it Harvey?
You told him that?
Oh, you are so dead, baboon!
No.
Leave him alone!
Get off him!
Come on!
Theresa, not the face.
Not the face!
Get me out of here, Hunter.
Come on, Shawn!
Oh, great, say my whole name.
Now Harvey's gonna be after me, too!
I'll find you, baboon, and when I do, you're dead!
The kid says "Harvey.
" Who could that be?
Ohh Cory, here are the notes from fourth period.
How long you gonna be in there?
Just slip my diploma through the grate.
Wait a minute.
Shawn, what kind of notes are these?
You've got doodles and tic-tac-toe and a piece of chewed gum?
Great.
You touched it.
Now I can't eat it.
It's bad enough I got to breathe through gym socks.
Give me some notes I was just leaving.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Look, Harley, it's only fair to warn you, I am wired to explosives in here.
You pull me out, this whole school blows sky high!
Hey, that's my friend and this is my locker.
I need a moment alone with baboon.
- Guys, go to class.
- Class!
That's a good one, Harley.
Like me and Frankie would ever be caught dead inside a classroom, right?
- Go!
- OK.
Look.
Harley, give me a chance to explain.
I trusted you to take my sister on a nice, polite date.
How do you repay me?
You try and take advantage of that sweet, innocent child.
I was not the one making the moves!
What are you saying to me, baboon?
I'm right behind you, buddy!
She was all over me, I swear!
You expect me to believe that my angelic baby sister actually came on to you?
Harley, I wouldn't make this up.
It's the truth.
You gotta believe me.
Any of you guys know a girl named T.K.?
- Is she fast, like he says she is?
- Oh, yeah!
You guys know the "K" in T.K. stands for my sister?
Oh, no!
This is very disconcerting.
Look, Harley, I didn't mean to say she's a bad person, - 'cause she's not.
- I know, I know.
It's just, you try and do good by 'em, raise 'em right.
But I guess it wasn't enough.
You know, your sister loves you a lot.
She told me you're the only one that's always been there for her.
And yet, it seems I failed her.
Well, it's the pressures, you know?
The demands of my day.
I mean, I'm so busy collectin' lunch money and dunking kids' heads into toilets, I hardly have time for my sister anymore.
You do the best you can.
Yeah.
She needs more.
She just needs somebody to set a good example for her.
And you, you're always gonna be the biggest influence in her life.
Yeah.
I could talk to her.
You know, set her straight a little.
Yeah, that's what's important, not who she's dating.
Well, personally, I was kinda hopin' she'd date you.
'Course, that's up to you and T.K. But, if it works out and you go out again you take her somewhere nice, eh?
See, my sister, she deserves it.
So, Harley, does this mean, me and you, we're OK?
No.
You can think about it!
You ain't nothing, Keiner!
And I ain't afraid of you, either!
I just can't get out of this locker.
Cory?
Cory!
Mr. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews, Thank you oh, so very much for having me for dinner in your lovely home.
No, thank you for the lobsters!
You're welcome, I'm sure.
So, how's the new me coming across, fuzzy?
You're doing great.
Uh-oh.
This guy's missing a claw.
That is it!
I told 'em these are important people.
This is a very big dinner for me.
I wanted everything to be perfect!
What do they do?
They send me damaged goods.
Mr. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews, thank you oh, so very much for having me for dinner in your lovely home.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
OK, Mom, about your new car.
Now, we know you gotta be practical so we think the family car for you is the turbo-charged Ferrari Testarossa.
How many seats?
Two, which is one more than the Harley we were thinking about.
And where shall I put my family?
See, Cory and I are gonna hang on to the back bumper there.
And we're gonna sit Morgan up in the back window.
She's just gonna kinda Guys, this is your mother's car, it is your mother's decision, and she will make her choice in her own good time.
Hopefully while there's still fossil fuel on the planet.
Somebody look.
Is she smiling?
No, she's got the same glazed look on her face she's had the last two months.
It's the van.
- No!
- Shh.
Quiet, guys.
Go ahead, sweetheart.
No, the van would be great for when we go camping, and I can really see being able to fit in all the kids for soccer.
And it'd help with work.
I could put the paintings in for the gallery.
So you'd be happy with the van?
I could see it.
I could see how this would work.
Well, do you see any particular color?
No, color's not in focus yet.
Why don't you take it for a test drive around the house?
Well, gentlemen, were you taking notes?
On what?
On one of the subtle differences between men and women.
See, we're men.
We like to rush, rush, rush, rush, rush.
You know, we like to just do it.
But women, they don't like to just do it.
You gotta buy 'em a car first.
Just kidding.
Really, I never said that.
So what's Hamlet supposed to do?
His uncle offed his father, his mother's sleeping with his uncle, his girlfriend is completely schizoid, and people are dropping left and right.
Sounds like Thanksgiving at my house.
So Hamlet is faced with a terrible dilemma, and he freezes like a bunny in the high beams.
- For me?
- Shawn.
Oh, yeah, right.
See, when you looked at me, I naturally Just pass it.
October, 1962.
Young President Kennedy is faced with a seemingly impossible dilemma.
Mr. Hunter, what were his options?
Marilyn Monroe or his wife?
You never disappoint, Mr. Hunter.
Thank you.
Cory.
Ah, a note for me.
See, Shawn, you're not the only one Pass it to Shawn.
Do I have an unlisted desk or something?
Stacy, Linda.
Linda, Stacy.
I've never been so depressed in my whole life.
I know.
Two beautiful girls both want you, poor guy.
There's gotta be a hot line you can call.
Of course, with your luck, a girl would answer and she'd want you.
If I reject Linda, she'll get upset, and there is no way I would ever want to see a pout on those beautiful full lips.
Actually, it looks pretty good.
Where do you see that?
But-But what if I reject Stacy and she flips out, gets a sex-change operation and comes back as a really angry man seeking her revenge?
Hey, I've seen it happen.
- Shawn, just choose.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
You did at lunch.
- When?
When you picked meat loaf instead of chicken.
How did you do that?
Well, I couldn't decide.
Then I saw you were getting the chicken.
So I figured if I changed my mind, I could have some of yours.
She's back?
How do you know if you're having an idea?
You are a sick and twisted individual.
To you.
To me, I'm a visionary.
- It can't work.
- It's bulletproof.
I start dating one of the girls while you go out with the other one.
That way she's off the market until I'm ready to date her.
What, you want me to keep her fresh until you're ready for her?
What am I Tupperware?
What else do you have to do?
What do I have to do?
I'll have you know - my calendar is chock-full.
- Of what?
Well, look, right here.
I mean, I got Lincoln's birthday, and after that I got "Lincoln's birthday, traditional," and then there's, uh, "vernal equinox" and, uh, "Cinco de Mayo" and "reorder calendar pages.
" See, I'm so busy I can't even talk to you now.
- So you're gonna do this for me.
- Oh, obviously!
You're a lifesaver.
I owe you.
Yeah, yeah.
So, Shawn, just choose.
Which one am I baby-sitting, meat loaf or chicken?
OK, whichever one comes up to me first, I'll go out with her, because that means she likes me better than the other one.
- Hi, Shawn.
- Linda.
- Linda, congratulations.
- For what?
For looking very Lindacious today.
Isn't that enough?
Not for me.
Call me.
What was that all about?
I thought she was the one.
I don't know.
I panicked.
I can't decide.
Fine.
You know what?
You take Stacy, I'll take Linda.
- No.
I want Linda.
- Fine.
Then I'll take Stacy.
- No.
- Shawn, you're being greedy.
- No, I'm not.
- Fine.
- I'll go out with Debbie.
- I want Debbie.
There is no Debbie.
Somewhere there's a Debbie.
Hey, Joey, it's Friday afternoon.
Ain't you forgettin' something?
Oh, yeah, I forgot to clean out my locker.
Yes, gentlemen, Friday already.
Enjoy your weekend, don't get too much sun, and I'll see you on Monday.
Look at 'em run.
Call me soft, but I like making people happy.
So I say to myself, "Hey, you got a free night?
How about giving some lucky girl a chance"?
Well, I've certainly always dreamed of you asking me.
What's your name again?
Roy, with an "R".
So, yes or no?
We going out tonight?
Hey, Roy, come here quick.
You gotta see this.
Some guy is making a major fool of himself asking out this girl who's totally not interested.
Oh, wait, it's you.
Yeah, really funny, Matthews.
Your loss.
In time, I think she'll get over it.
Thanks.
I never know what to say when creepy guys are coming on to me.
- Me neither.
- Could I ask you a question, Cory?
Creepy guys don't really come on to me.
That's not what I meant.
No, I meant about Shawn.
Is he avoiding me?
Shawn avoiding you?
What makes you say that?
Yo, Cor, I just wanted yaah.
Ha He's just shy, especially around beautiful girls like you.
He thinks I'm beautiful?
How could he not?
I mean, look at you.
I also think he would say what a nice smile you have and how smart and sweet you are.
He's intimidated.
Shawn.
Shawn intimidated?
Well, it's kind of hard to talk to girls you like.
So, how come you're not intimidated?
Because, well, if you notice, I'm not looking directly at your smart sweet smile.
Would you?
Hey, you girls wanna dance?
OK.
So dance.
What'd I say?
I can't believe you go to John Adams High and you've never been to Chubbie's before.
I just always heard it was such a dive.
Well, it used to be a dive, but now it's a rathole.
How's the food?
What do you mean, how's the food?
It's a rathole.
May I see a menu, please?
First time here.
Exchange student.
Latvia.
Nicht menu.
Nicht.
Listen, Linda, you can't just come in here first time and order.
- Why not?
- Because Chubbie doesn't like that, and if Chubbie doesn't respect you, he won't feed you.
- OK, then what do I do?
- All right, listen.
He's gonna turn around and raise one eyebrow.
He will not speak.
You'll have a two-second window to order.
You say, "Turkey, Chubbie.
" He'll wipe his nose.
Then you say, "With everything.
" Then he's gonna look at you real hard, like he's making a decision about you.
If he asks what you want to drink, you're in.
You're set for life.
I'm so glad you're here.
So am I because now I can tell you that Shh!
He's starting to turn.
Turkey, Chubbie.
- With everything.
- To drink?
What do you recommend?
- Soda.
- You got diet?
Yeah.
Half the calories.
I've never seen anybody come in here and get that kind of respect from Chubbie.
- You're a natural.
- Hey, I had help from the best.
Think so?
Well, the best is really Shawn.
You should see him order.
I get chills.
Where are you going?
I was gonna sit over here.
What's wrong with next to me?
I don't know.
Why don't I go over there and see?
Whew.
You're right.
It's actually very nice over here.
Why is that?
Well, I think it's being here with you.
You know what's funny?
You start out in the morning thinking about one person, and you end up in a booth next to somebody else.
- Oh, boy!
- What's the matter, Cory?
I I was just thinking.
Did you know that Shawn is my friend?
You're such a sweet guy, Cory.
I love that.
I can't believe you just did that.
I'm pretty shocked myself.
Boys, remember our little talk we had yesterday about women?
Yeah, listen, on that subject, I could use some advice.
Glad to, son, but first admire the wonder that is me.
Remember yesterday I explained how women are creatures of process?
Men, on the other hand, are creatures of action, and I, being a man, have taken action.
Amy, sweetheart, darling, can you come down here, please?
Now, watch how she jumps up and down and throws her arm around my neck with gratitude.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, darling.
You know how you hate those pushy car salesmen - who call you "little lady"?
- Yes Such is my love for you that I've saved you from that.
If you would just step right over here, look out the door at your brand-new fully-loaded 1995 minivan.
- Alan, did you buy that?
- Yes, I did!
- So we own it?
- Yes!
Yes.
This is not jumping here.
- This is not what I wanted.
- Yes, it is.
It's green, beige interior, just like you said.
Ask the guys.
Cory?
Eric?
Oh, thanks.
I can't believe you did this.
- You said you wanted it.
- No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
You could see yourself in it, remember?
You were driving and camping and with the kids and smiling at your husband.
Jump.
Jump for the boys.
We were talking about a car, and you just went out and bought it.
What is it with you men?
Rush, rush, rush!
It has cup holders.
Why don't we talk about this in the other room?
Oh, you wanted some advice about women?
Yeah.
So do I. - Eric, help.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't come to me with your seventh-grade milk-and-cookie social problems, OK?
Please.
I'm in deep personal agony.
OK, I'm up for a laugh.
Let's hear it.
All right, listen, there are two girls that both like Shawn.
He can't decide who he likes better, so he decides to go out with one while I kind of baby-sit the other.
'Cause you're safe, right?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Well, I mean, you're no risk.
Shawn's saying, by putting this girl with you, it's like putting her in a storage bin.
She's protected.
It's like she's going out with bubble wrap.
I'll have you know that there are women who think I'm very dangerous.
Like who Grandma?
Not just Grandma, although she is very frightened of me.
- Who else?
- Linda, my assignment, also happens to think I'm not so safe.
Yeah?
What'd you do, run with scissors?
I kissed her.
- Where?
- Chubbie's.
- No.
- Lips.
All right, Cory!
You're not safe anymore.
All your problems are solved.
Eric, my problem's just beginning.
- I mean, I like Linda and she likes me.
- Mm-hmm.
But Shawn doesn't know anything about it.
So you went behind your best friend's back and stole the girl he was lying to.
Movie of the week or what?
Look, Cory, everything's OK.
You've got a girlfriend, Shawn's got a girlfriend.
You're right.
I've got a girlfriend who I can kiss on the lips whenever I want.
If it's OK with her.
You're right.
Everything's OK.
Unless, of course, Shawn breaks up with his girlfriend.
That can't happen.
Could that happen?
Cor, I know most seventh-grade relationships end in marriage, but you never can tell.
Eric, help me.
This is important.
No.
You've gotta decide what's more important your best friend or your girlfriend.
I don't wanna decide that.
Whatever I decide, I lose.
Young and inexperienced, he finds himself caught on the horns of an agonizing dilemma, and so young President Kennedy, charged with keeping the peace, fears that his inexperience may bring about the destruction of the entire world.
Oh, give him a break!
This was his first big crisis.
It wasn't his fault he liked the girl.
- Mr. Matthews - Yes?
Put your head down.
It's nap time.
You know, just once I'd like to see a movie where nobody's head blows up.
You're kidding me.
What type of movie do you want to see?
I don't know.
How about a romantic foreign film?
Oh, please.
They don't even try to speak English in those movies.
I'm beginning to think we have nothing in common.
Yeah?
Well, I'm beginning to think we have nothing in common.
Stacy, Shawn By the way, you're an idiot.
Are you two gonna let a movie get in the way of a love that should last for all eternity?
Looks like it.
Look, there's no one there.
Yeah.
Good thing I've still got Linda on deck.
You're a lifesaver, bud.
Hey, don't give up on Stacy.
That's a solid relationship there, a relationship a lot of people are depending upon.
What do you mean?
I mean, you can't live without her.
Look at you.
You're getting nervous.
You're sweating.
Your voice is getting higher.
Now go!
Go get her!
Go get her, man.
OK, I'll go.
Look, you have lettuce, you have tomatoes.
Why can't you just toss me a salad, you greasy, greasy man?
Hey, where do you think you are the Sizzler?
Stacy, funny running into you.
You been here before?
A couple of times.
I can never get this guy to give me any food.
Allow me.
- Turkey, Chubbie.
- Turkey, Chubbie.
- With everything.
- With everything.
I am not greasy.
I glow.
Wait.
I don't like turkey.
That's OK.
It's not really turkey.
You know, Stacy, it's so weird seeing you here without Shawn.
I just think of you guys as such a couple.
- How long you been going out?
- Four days.
Seems like five.
Look, I don't really want to hear the name "Shawn" right now.
That's OK.
I understand.
You know, when I watched you and Merle argue, it tore me up.
It did?
That's really sweet.
You wanna talk sweet?
Merle is sweet.
Look, Cory, it's just not working with me and Merle.
Give him a chance.
Go out with him for a year or two.
See if it works.
I'm begging you.
Cory, what's going on?
Linda.
Linda, right?
Turning around would only confirm that it's Linda.
Hi, Cory.
Linda, it's so nice to see you.
Wanna join us?
- Well, I'd hate to interrupt.
- What, this?
This is nothing.
It means nothing.
I only sat next to Stacy and took her nothing hand to tell her she should keep going out with Shawn.
Yeah, all he talked about was Shawn.
Really?
Did he also show you how to order?
Yeah, he did.
No, see, she was standing in the line Shows you how to order, gets you all cozy in the booth, talks about Shawn, and then boom.
He makes his move.
Is that what you were doing?
No, I couldn't.
I don't have moves.
I don't have boom.
He did this to you, too?
Yeah, it's a whole routine.
You think he's so nice.
- I am nice.
- He looks so innocent.
I'm a newborn lamb.
Baa!
And then he snakes you away from Shawn.
- Oh, poor Shawn.
- What?
Hey, guys.
- Shawn, you poor baby.
- Are you kidding me?
Hey, that's my poor baby.
What's going on here, Cory?
Nothing good for me.
Your so-called friend here has been trying to snake your girlfriends behind your back.
He pretends to build you up, then makes his move.
No move.
Hardly at all.
None to her.
Maybe a little over there.
Listen, Shawn, buddy Girls, could you excuse us?
I'll see you later, OK?
And I'll see you after that.
Yeah, fine.
I'll open up an antique shop.
Cory, I asked you a simple favor.
Yeah, you thought I was safe, didn't you?
You thought I was bubble wrap.
Well, I am not safe.
I am your most dangerous friend.
- You like Linda.
- Yeah, I do.
Cory, that was not part of the plan.
Well, maybe I don't fit into your safe little plan.
Maybe that first day you came up to me in the hallway and said, "Cory, baby-sit Linda for me until I break up with Stacy," I should have just said no, but I was stupid.
I'll tell you something, pal.
I'm never gonna be that stupid again.
Both of them, right?
Yeah.
I turn around, they're both gonna be there.
Yes, they are.
Linda, Stacy, we thought you left.
Boy, we really thought you left.
I forgot my purse.
Wasn't that lucky?
Oh, yes, very lucky.
Here you go.
- Thank you.
- Ahh!
- What about him?
- Ahh!
I don't know which one of you two is sleazier.
He is!
- It was your idea.
- Well, you went behind my back.
- That's 'cause I really liked her.
- Well, I really like them both.
You two are-are Scum!
Thank you.
You treat us like objects, not people.
You're right.
I'm real, real sorry.
I just hope we can put this whole thing behind us and start fresh, OK?
Cory, I'll thumb-wrestle you for Linda.
Shawn, they're clapping because they hate us.
Oh.
Well, same to you!
You know, I miss Linda already.
I miss Stacy and Linda.
- And Debbie?
- And Debbie.
There is no Debbie.
Well, then how come I miss her so much?
Because you're nuts.
So, here we are, just the two of us.
Couple of dangerous guys.
Me too?
You?
You are very dangerous.
You're so dangerous, I am never gonna trust you with a girl again.
So what you're saying is, I lose my first girlfriend but my best friend finally begins to respect me?
Yeah.
I'll take it.
I know this is a little strange, but we'd like to return the van.
Why?
It's kind of complicated.
There was a little miscommunication.
Did somebody here assume that somebody else was in a life position that they weren't in yet?
- Yes, someone did.
- You said you wanted the van.
You just went out and bought it.
- You told me to buy it.
- Didn't.
- Did.
- Didn't.
Excuse me!
This is not about assigning blame.
This is about who you are as individuals and as a driving couple.
What kind of car dealer are you?
I don't want to hear that word, but what I want to hear is the sound of you two listening to each other.
Now, tell me about Amy.
Not the Amy that the world sees, but the inner Amy.
Well, I've never felt that I was just a wife and mother.
How long is this going to take?
An hour today, and then I suggest that we get together again next week and then the week after that until we start to see some progress.
Well, uh, Tuesdays, three or five, I'm free.
Tuesday's good for me.
Alan?
I just want to buy a car.
I give you money, you give me metal, we drive it home.
It's done.
Tuesday's fine for me.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
You know, George, you'd think a man of your stature would be able to find some underling to help you with this brainless grunt work.
There you are, Mr. Turner.
Make me proud.
Ah, how did I not see that coming?
- Ah, "Turnaround Dance," huh?
- Yes, the young ladies ask the young men.
Ah, so the guys are sweatin' it out, huh?
Ha, ha, ha poor dopes.
I'm glad those days are over.
- Good morning, George.
Jonathan.
- Oh, hi, Kat.
Ahh Miss Tompkins, I trust you're available to chaperone this Friday?
- Do I have a choice?
- No.
Can't wait.
And of course feel free to invite a gentleman.
After all, it is a "Turnaround Dance.
" Oh, that's right.
Thanks.
Jonathan?
Yes.
A little higher on the right.
Turnaround dance, huh?
Girls ask the guys.
Merry Christmas to me.
Ah, it's about time the girls had to worry and sweat and write out a list of topics to talk about on their hands.
- You do that?
- No, never.
I'm just glad the pressure's off.
You know, we just get to sit back and wait.
Is that what you think, the pressure's off?
- Dream on, girls.
- Wait!
Come back, come back.
What?
Look, a turnaround dance tells you where you stand.
And the type of girl who asks you, tells you who you are.
- Well, who are you if nobody asks?
- Then you're you.
Well, how do you get asked by a cool girl?
- Positioning.
- Huh?
Look, you want a cool girl, hang near her locker.
Stay in her direct vision.
If she can't see you, she can't ask you.
Remember, positioning.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Jacqueline, where you headed?
You know, I was just going that way.
OK, positioning.
We're in a main hallway, between the bathroom and a drinking fountain.
There's good foot-traffic.
All right, let's do it.
Shawn!
Come on, positioning.
How do you expect to get asked out with your head in a locker?
Shawn, would you go to the turnaround dance with me?
Becky?
How are you?
Sure, I'll go.
- Pick you up at eight?
- I'll wear something sexy.
Becky Scholtz I'm impressed, Shawn.
She's like the third coolest girl in our grade.
You know, the pressure's totally off you and all on me.
Ok OK, positioning.
Positioning.
Hey, Cory Shawn.
What are you guys doing?
Oh uh we're just standing and being here And hoping a girl asks you to the dance?
- Could be.
- Well, I'm not going.
My only hope.
I mean why?
It's a protest.
The concept of a turnaround dance, implies that all the other times, only the boys can do the asking.
That's destructive, gender-biased thinking, and we have to get beyond that.
Why?
Besides, that weekend, my daddy's taking me to New York for Christmas shopping.
I'll see you in class.
Oh, man, now I've got to find an above-average girl, who's into, "destructive, gender-biased thinking.
" - How about Allison?
- Allison Cheever?
Get real.
Why, just because she's the coolest girl in our grade, you don't think she'd ask me?
If a bomb dropped on the school and every other boy was killed except you?
She'd go with the most popular dead guy.
- Come on, man, we've got class.
- Go learn.
My place is here.
- Cory?
- Yes.
Would you go to the Turnaround Dance with me?
Yes, I'd love to go with you!
Yes?
You said, "yes"?
- Where'd you come from?
- I asked you and you said, "yes.
" Cory Matthews and I are going to the dance.
I can't believe it.
An average guy said yes to me.
Listen, Ingrid, you know how you think I said I'd go to the dance with you?
You're gonna think this is pretty amazing, but see, that wasn't me.
See, there's this guy, who looks like me and sounds like me, but he's not me.
Now, I reported him to the police, but they keep arresting me.
Oh, yeah, that'll work.
- Dad!
- No, it's not me.
It's just a guy who looks like me.
And the both of us are wondering what the two of you are up to?
OK, look.
This girl Ingrid, she invited me to the Turnaround Dance and I don't want to go.
I mean, I wanna go, just not with her.
- But you said yes to her.
- Yeah, but my whole social standing for the rest of the year depends on which girl I'm there with.
Oh, that's different.
I understand.
Go with the girl you said yes to.
Eric, I don't want to hurt Ingrid, 'cause she's a really sweet girl.
But enough about her, get me out of this date.
- Look, you heard what Dad said.
- Oh, please, he's old.
He's out of touch.
I mean, the last girl he dated was Mom.
No, no, no, no Cor, Cor, Cor You have to go with Ingrid.
You bail on this girl, it's all over for you.
- Why?
It's one girl, one date.
- No, no, no You dump one girl, they're all gonna know and they're all gonna hate you.
Remember, women are in constant communication with each other.
What are you talking about?
Cor, did you enjoy the vegetarian chili mom made last night as much as I did?
You know, sometimes I think we take our great mom for granted.
Eric, could we please stick to my problem for a second here?
Yes, your problem.
Your problem is the international women's network.
Look, you blow off this girl, everybody online's gonna know about it in the morning.
- Oh, I don't believe that.
- Well, you could be right, - then again - I didn't know you liked my chili.
What can I get my wonderful boys for dinner tomorrow night?
And bad news, it travels even faster.
Shaw's play, Pygmalion, is filled with strong opinions about class prejudice.
You guys agree or disagree?
Wow, I didn't know they were taking the class picture today.
Come on.
How you speak, how you walk, affects how you're gonna do in life.
You guys believe that?
Oh, come on.
What if day one I walked into this classroom Hey, how ya doin'?
My name is Mr. Turner.
I gonna be learnin' yous guys some good English.
OK?
- What would you think?
- I'd have a shot at an A. How you speak, how you look, affects people's perceptions of who you are.
Read Pygmalion, people!
Don't make me do this again tomorrow.
Cory, you're gonna love me.
I just figured out how to make your date with Ingrid work.
It's OK, Shawn, I've accepted my average fate.
No, look, you'd be happy to go to the dance with her if she was cool.
- Yeah, but she's not cool.
- So we make her cool.
- Is that possible?
- It's all here in the pig-play.
You know, we change her clothes, her hair her whole look.
Shawn, we're guys.
What do we know about girls clothes?
Not much, but I'm thinking Becky Schultz knows a whole lot.
- You think she'd help us?
- Hey, she asked me to the dance, and I said yes.
So I figure I could ask her for something and she'd say yes.
You sure you wanna waste it on this?
- Hi, Kat.
- Hi, Jonathan.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
You leaving town?
Holidays with the folks?
Actually, George has me chaperoning the Turnaround Dance.
Oh, right.
Yeah, that's the one where the girls ask the guys.
Yeah, and the guys sweat it out waiting.
Poor dopes.
Ha!
Yeah, poor dopes.
Poor, poor dopes.
Try a hammer, Mr. Turner.
All right, what do you think?
Ingrid with this hair?
And these lips.
All right, Morgan, go bring this upstairs to Ingrid and Becky.
- She's scary looking.
- Boys like that.
Boys shouldn't like that.
Look at these women, they're starved.
They've had lifts and implants.
All to just make them look like some idiotic male fantasy image of women.
Where did you find pictures like these?
In the magazines on your night stand.
Oh, you didn't open the drawer, did you?
Here she comes.
- Wow, she looks just like Becky.
- I am Becky.
Ladies and gentlemen, the new and improved Ingrid Iverson!
- Wow!
- Is it OK?
- Yeah.
- Nope.
- What?
!
- I'm telling you, we missed.
- It doesn't work at all.
- Becky said I looked pretty.
Yeah, you do.
Shawn, what's with you?
She's gorgeous.
Fine, she's gorgeous.
What does that give you?
- Pretty much everything.
- Cory, we're going for cool here.
Cool is more than just looks.
It's an attitude, it's a feel.
Look.
This girl is exotic.
There's something mysterious about her.
She looks like her name would be, Ameretto, or Frangelico, or Kahlua.
You mean we need to give Ingrid a foreign name?
It is foreign.
It's Swedish.
Wait a minute, you mean, like Swedish from Switzerland?
Like from Sweden, where my mom's family lives.
You have family in Switzerland?
- Sweden.
- Yeah.
Yeah, we go there every summer.
My aunt Uma has a house on the beach.
Uma, Uma, Uma Oh, Cory, this is too good.
Come on, Shawn, what do you mean?
Ingrid, confirm or deny, in Sweden, at the beach women naked?
- Yeah, sure, it's no big deal.
- Wrong, it's a very big deal.
Yeah, for the Swedish guys, but what does it get us?
Cory, by this time tomorrow, I can make Ingrid cool at John Adams High.
And you cool by association.
But in order to do that, you must be willing to boldly go where no seventh graders have ever gone before.
- Are you with me?
- Yes, please.
No, no.
His plans never work.
- It's gonna blow up in our faces.
- I wanna be popular!
OK, we'll go with the Swede.
So, Cory's going out with Ingrid, right?
Did you know that she's Swedish?
Sweden, huh?
Is it true what they say?
- Ja, they sunbathe in the nude.
- Amazing.
- What about the schools?
- Nude.
- The malls.
- Nude.
At the Gap, all they sell are hats.
Ooh, here she comes.
Ooh, here she comes!
Wow, look at Ingrid.
She's so - Cool?
- Yeah, but what's with the clothes?
Well, it's really not for me to say, but underneath the clothes nude.
- They're buying.
- Oh, yeah.
The girl in the white turtleneck, is that Ingrid Iverson?
- That's her.
- What on earth has she done to herself?
Oh, she didn't do it, we did.
Cory and me.
Cory and I, Mr. Hunter.
Oh, yeah, sure, now everybody wants to take credit.
So, ladies, tomorrow night at my place, a little pre-dance smorgasbord?
- Just say ja.
- OK.
Cory, can I talk to you for a minute?
Oh-oh.
- Cory, I can't go to the dance with you.
- Wha?
You know how you guys wanted me to be cool?
- Yeah?
- It's working better than I ever dreamed.
This morning, Rick Lawler talked to me.
He's never talked to me before.
So I asked him to the dance and he said yes.
- Aren't you happy for me?
- Not especially.
I mean, you asked me first.
You and I are going.
A week ago, Rick Lawler didn't even know I was alive.
And now we're going out.
You wouldn't want me to pass that up, would you?
Yes, pass!
Cory, I could have never done this without you.
Thanks for everything.
On the cheek.
Sorry, man, I just heard.
It just happened!
Yeah, well, I'm tapped into the girls network.
Shawn, I gotta face facts.
I'm average.
And average guys don't get asked to dances.
It just doesn't happen.
Cory, would you take me to the dance?
Do you see her too?
Yeah, man, I do.
I heard what just happened with Ingrid and I'm really sorry.
But I'm also really happy, because I do need someone to take me to the dance.
Wait, wait, wait You're asking me?
Yes, would you?
I don't want to appear to be anxious, but yes, yes, yes!
- You gonna go pick up your date now?
- Oh, no, no, no Tonight is Turnaround.
Tonight I sit down, relax, make myself pretty.
While the girl comes to the door, asks if I'm ready, and suffers through the nightmare interrogation by the parents.
I feel so cheap.
But you know, I kind of like it.
Hey, Cor, come on, your ride's leaving!
- Have a good time.
- So, what do you guys got planned?
Morgan's sleeping over at a friend's, and you guys are going to a dance We thought we'd finish trimming the tree, wrap a few presents and go to bed early.
- Careful, you don't want to overdo it.
- Yeah, you know, at our age Go on, go on, have a good time.
Get out.
Come on.
Goodbye.
- OK, bye.
- Love ya.
- They're gone.
- Lock the door.
They're gone, they're gone, they're gone Gone, gone, gone - So, you ready to turn in?
- Uh-huh.
Maybe a little wine first.
A little nibbly, a little you.
Easy, easy you don't want to overexert yourself.
No, not at our age.
Loosen up those muscles.
Come on, sit back.
- There you go - Ahh Merry Christmas, baby.
Well, here we are.
Is there a special VIP area for us popular couples?
Oh, well, thanks for bringing me.
Wait, wait where you going?
Over there with Danny.
You know I'm going out with Danny, right?
- But you asked me.
- I asked you to take me.
See, my parents won't let me go out with ninth graders, so I always get somebody else to take me to the dances and then I meet up with Danny.
Everybody knows that.
- Didn't you know that?
- No!
When you asked me to take you to the dance, I figured you wanted me to take you to the dance.
Stupid, stupid me!
- Well, thanks.
- No!
Keep your pity cheek-kiss.
Cory, just heard about you and Allison.
How do you do that?
- So you were dumped.
- Twice, Shawn.
Same dance.
It's gotta be a record.
Hey, you'll be in the yearbook.
Don't sweat it, man.
I'll go grab you a glass of punch and a big pile of cookies.
Good sugar rush and you'll be fine.
This is a school function, not the back seat of your car.
I expect while you're at this dance, that you behave with a reasonable amount of restraint.
- We were just talking, George.
- You're supposed to be chaperoning.
What if I just showed up, found a pretty woman, chatted her up, ignored the students and had a wonderful time?
Why don't you?
I guess I could.
There's Miss Sneider, over by the punch.
Yes Good choice.
Well, carry on.
So basically, you strung me along all week, not because you were considering anybody else, but because you get some sort of twisted pleasure out of watching me squirm?
Yep.
You weren't worried about somebody else just snapping me up?
Oh, I put the word out in the girls' network - hands off.
So you picked me before you picked me?
That's how it works.
You know, it's a pretty big room.
I think we could do a better job chaperoning, if we were moving around close together.
You looking one way, me looking the other - Do you wanna dance?
- I thought you'd never ask.
Ingrid?
Cory, is that you?
Yeah, what happened to you?
You're soaked.
A bunch of us popular couples were standing around the pool talking and everyone kept saying how cool it'd be to jump in.
- So all you jumped in?
- No, just me.
You see, the cool thing is talking about jumping in, not actually doing it.
I didn't know that.
Now I'm all wet, my contacts fell out and my cool boyfriend discovered a bunch of dry people he'd rather be with.
Here you go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So, where's Allison?
With Danny Taylor her boyfriend.
- The one that everybody knows about.
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry about that.
- Well, sorry about that.
Yeah, well, I guess that's what I get for trying to be one of the cool kids.
- Which clearly I'm not.
- I'm with you there.
Listen, Ingrid, I wanted to say I'm sorry for what Shawn and I did to you.
You know, changing you around and everything.
That's OK.
It was really fun for awhile until I hit the water.
No, see, we didn't do it for you, we did it for me.
So I could have a date that everyone else thought was cool.
Yeah, I knew that.
That's why I didn't feel bad about dumping you.
Until now.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
You know what's funny?
We might have actually had a good time tonight, if we'd just come here together as ourselves.
Yeah, you may be right.
- I guess we'll never know.
- Guess not.
Unless Well, I mean, there's always next year.
- Hey, there's still this year.
- Yeah It doesn't matter if other people think we're cool.
We know who we are.
Are you Ingrid, the girl that jumped in the pool?
Yeah, that would be me.
- I think you're so cool -wanna dance?
- Yeah, sure.
Wait, wait, wait What about knowing who we are?
Give me a break.
Hey, just heard about you and Ingrid.
- The women's network, right?
- No, actually I was standing right here.
So where's Becky?
In the girls' room for six hours, like always.
- Hey, girls.
- Eric, not now, OK?
- Anytime but now.
- Why, 'cause you got dumped twice?
- Three times.
- Wow!
- I don't see you with your date.
- Yeah, where's Jacqueline?
Funny thing, her old boyfriend came into town.
Turns out things aren't over between them.
She hopes I'll understand.
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.
Completely, you know, relaxed about the whole situation.
Hi, want a picture to remember the dance?
Drop dead!
Yeah, you're real relaxed, Eric.
No!
Wait, wait, wait!
Come back!
Take a picture.
A picture of the three coolest guys at the dance.
- Yeah, all sittin' at the losers' table.
- Listen, if we smile now, in 20 years if anyone asks, our dates were all in the bathroom.
- Hey, mine really is.
- Ha-ha shut up!
- All right, everybody say cheese.
- You've gotta say "dumped.
" - Dumped.
- Dumped.
Cheese.
Eric, look at this.
Uh-oh.
Why don't you go on upstairs.
- What?
- Nothing here you need to see.
Why don't you just get on upstairs, OK?
Great.
Ah, you guys are gonna have such a nice evening.
Maybe it's not too late.
- You all warm and snuggly?
- Yeah, don't stop.
Your turn to do me.
I've been doing you for uh six hours?
!
Ten more minutes.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Cyrano de Bergerac stands in the shadows whispering poetry to the lovely Roxanne, but she thinks it's the good-looking guy speaking to her.
So our poor, big-nosed lug wins the heart of the woman he loves, but he wins it for somebody else.
That is so sweet and so noble, that he would sacrifice his own happiness - to help his friend.
- Other opinions?
- Loser!
- OK, define "loser.
" Big dip.
It makes no sense.
I mean, he likes this girl and then he passes her on to another guy.
Dip the biggest.
Topanga, can you refute the "dip" theory?
Cyrano performs a totally selfless act and he does it for the sake of love.
- That is so romantic.
- Why?
What does he get out of it?
He knocks himself out spewing poetry, his friend gets the girl All he can do is go home and blow his big nose.
Rebuttal from the estrogen section.
Boys don't understand passion and romance, and will never understand women.
And that's why all of you will spend half your lives confused and the other half paying alimony.
This is interesting.
The women here find Cyrano compelling and romantic, and yet the men find him misguided and dip like.
- What does this tell us?
- Women like dips?
Sorry, Matthews, no luck.
It tells us that men have a hard time understanding what women find romantic.
Will that be on the test?
Oh, yeah, in ways you can not yet imagine.
- Here we go.
- Thanks, George.
If I'd hidden it anywhere in the house, she'd have found it for sure.
Always glad to be a good neighbor and help you stash your whatever it is.
Trash compactor.
- A trash compactor?
- Yeah.
For your anniversary?
How surprising.
That's the whole idea.
I went all-out on this one.
This is top-of-the-line.
This is two tons of pressure.
You put coal in this baby, you get diamonds.
- That might have been a better way to go.
- What do you mean?
Oh, nothing.
I'm certain that you got her exactly what she wanted.
- She does want this, hm?
- Oh, yeah She's been talking about having a compactor in the kitchen for years.
Well, happy anniversary.
And I hope you have others.
Amy, my bride!
Dinner reservations in half an hour!
- So Dad, what's up?
- I'll give you a clue.
something very important happened.
- It's your anniversary, right?
- Correct.
Gifts.
Come on, don't leave us out in the cold, man.
- We need our names on that card.
- I suppose there's room for all on my love bus.
And your name is?
- Give me this.
- I'm ready for dinner.
That and more.
But are you ready for this?
- Oh, what is that?
- Happy anniversary, my sweet.
Yes!
- Wow, a trash compactor.
- Yes!
Thank you.
- We were just putting our names on the - Cory.
"To Amy-with love from Alan.
" Just Alan, nobody else.
See ya!
Well do you like it?
Yes, it's it's fine.
- Let's go.
- Amy, call me crazy, but this is exactly what you said you wanted.
Yes, Alan.
And a trash compactor would be a lovely gift on say a Tuesday.
You said you wanted compactor.
I get compactor.
Why Oogh wrong?
We don't want to be late for dinner.
Oogh not sleep in cave tonight.
Harley - What, no kiss?
- I'm not feeling real kissy, Gloria.
How come last night you keep me waiting for 20 minutes outside your house?
How come you sit outside my house, honk your horn and don't come in?
'Cause maybe I saw your father waitin' by the door - and maybe I didn't wanna say hello.
- That was my mother.
Then I definitely don't want to meet your father.
All my girlfriends, they have guys who come up to the door.
That's 'cause they don't have cars.
They got cars and they got manners, so there.
You got your finger in my face.
You call that manners?
Hey, hey, hey lovebirds I don't like what I'm hearin'.
Where's the magic gone in this relationship?
- If I may venture to interject my - Oh, cork it, Joey!
Inserting cork.
The next words you hear will not be mine.
Because I'm 100%, absolutely, zip.
Put white on my face right now and I'm a stinkin' mime.
Cork it, Joey.
What's the matter with you, Frankie?
You have not said anything all day.
I'm just having some quiet time.
That's good.
Some people around here could learn from that.
I'm telling you, the macaroni and cheese had more grease than Harley's hair.
I think that's how they made it, they just turned him over and wrung him out.
Ugh!
And I thought it was gonna be a slow day.
What?
You thought we were talking about your hair?
No no Everyone knows your hair's not greasy.
Why don't you test it and tell me?
Wow, dry as a bone.
Sorry, inner ear problem.
Here's a quarter, baboon.
Call your parents - say goodbye.
Uh, Harley, you know, in many countries, what I said about your hair, it might be considered a compliment.
For example, Greece.
- That's funny.
- Yeah, yeah, he's a pretty funny guy.
- So I guess I get to live, huh?
- Ha!
There's that humor again.
I will miss that.
Oh, Harley Are you sure you gotta beat him up?
Yeah, you don't wanna do something ugly to us in front of this beautiful angel of the hallway.
Harley, why would you waste your time pounding us when you could be spending it with Claudia Schiffer's cuter sister?
Oh, I don't know that I would say cuter.
- Turn it off!
- Turning it off, sir.
Oh, come on, Harley, go easy on 'em.
Do it for me.
Very well, Gloria.
I will not lay a hand on them.
Frankie, remember that piÃ±ata I promised you for your birthday?
Here's two.
Feliz Navidad.
Bye-bye.
Look, I've got an idea.
How about you give us a five-minute head start and then you hunt us down?
That way it's more fun for you.
OK, the way I see it, you guys got two options.
One - you die.
- I'll take number two.
- Yeah, number two is looking good to me.
Number two is, you do me a favor.
- Done.
- Happy to.
You just name it.
I, Frankie Stecchino, am in love.
Where's this going?
She's a goddess stepped down from heaven.
The most beautiful creature I have ever seen.
Her voice is like the tinkling of bells.
And her eyes also tinkle like bells.
Well, that's real sad and tender and what do you want from us?
Help me woo her.
What?
- Woo her.
- What?
I've watched you guys.
You're a good little talker.
And you girls seem to have a thing for you.
I want you guys to coach me.
Frankie, I don't know if we're the guys to help you woo her.
What?
Have you talked to Harley about this?
I mean, he could probably help you out more than us.
So you do not feel able to do me this favor?
- It's probably not such a great idea.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
All right, piÃ±ata boys, which one of you has the prize inside?
I don't wanna die before I know what woo is.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Well, I helped Morgan straighten up her room and I cleaned out those gutters.
You know Boy, you were right, they really needed it.
Ohh ha So, how you doin'?
Oh, wow I think I'll just take out this garbage.
I'll just get this garbage and I'll just take it out.
- Alan.
- George.
That looks suspiciously like a fluffy, non-compacted bag of garbage.
Yeah, well, I haven't gotten around to installing the you know, the trash compactor.
- Will you be?
- Not in this lifetime.
Ah I'm aware that it was an appliance, but it's not like it was a toaster.
It's a very expensive appliance.
I would've never have gotten it for her hadn't it been a very special occasion.
Heck, it cost more than her engagement ring.
Not an argument I would recommend using.
You know what I'm saying.
Perfectly.
She asked for a trash compactor and you went out and got it.
Kind of a no-brainer.
- No-brainer?
- Well, it was a real time-saver, wasn't it?
I mean, you didn't have to sit around thinking about her.
Racking your brains about what she would like, what would make her feel good.
What were the things about her that you love.
Whoo I missed that exit completely.
You think there's time to back up?
On the husband highway, there's very little forward traffic.
Just a million well-intentioned men backing up frantically.
You've been down that highway before, huh, George?
Yes, I have.
Before it was paved.
- Hey, Cor.
- Hi.
Shawn.
Aah!
Eric, you know Frankie Stecchino.
Frankie, this is my brother Eric.
Sure, Eric, I stole your lunch everyday, ninth grade.
Don't tell me - tuna on white.
- Wheat.
- Right, right - Those were days, huh?
- Excuse me.
What's the enforcer doing in our house?
- We have it under control.
- It's fine.
"Under control"?
Frankie Stecchino sprinkles guys like you on his pizza.
Eric, please, everything's fine.
OK.
Just remember, no sudden movements, no shiny objects in front of his face.
OK?
- It was nice seeing you again, Frankie.
- Nice to see you again, tuna.
Yeah.
OK, guys, teach me in the ways of love.
All right, Frankie.
This girl you like, you ever try to talk to her?
Oh, I uh I I I You can not let her psych you, man.
You just gotta walk right up to her - and tell her you like her, OK?
- Ohh OK.
- Let's pretend that this is her.
- Mmm could the pillow be her?
Anything you want, big guy.
Ah, there she is.
Ooh she looks very pretty today.
- I'd better go.
- Ah come on.
Come on, tell her how nice she looks.
I can't take my eyes off you.
I can't take my eyes off you.
Thank you, Frankie.
That's real nice.
I just wanted to tell you how pretty that dress is.
I just wanted to tell you how pretty that dress is.
Oh, this old thing.
There you go, you can do this.
No, no, no I could never do this by myself.
You guys have to come with me.
Frankie, I think she's gonna notice two guys hanging around you.
I mean, what are you gonna do, put us in your locker?
Stay with me here.
Frankie, it's not like there's a back way out of here.
I know, I checked.
Frankie, you're talking to yourself.
Not really.
See, I uh Mmm oh - She sound familiar to you?
- Quiet!
This is hard for me to say.
This is hard for me today.
Because I've watched you for so long.
And I've always dreamed of telling you how I feel about you.
Because I've watched you so long.
And I've always dreamed of something.
- What are you saying?
- I love you!
- I love you.
- You do?
I've always loved you.
I think about you all the time.
If you were my girl, I would treat you like the magic princess that you are.
You know, your friend never talks to me like this.
Perhaps he is not racked with the love that consumes his entire being.
- You wanna go get a burger?
- I would love to.
Shawn, I just figured out who that girl was.
Hey, she likes him.
We did it.
Oh, we did it all right.
We just fixed up Frankie with Harley Keiner's girlfriend.
That's not possible.
Ah!
Ah!
Oh, boy Oh, boy Oh, boy!
- We're in such trouble here.
- No, nobody saw us.
No witnesses.
And without witnesses, it's all just circumcised evidence.
Shawn, we just helped Frankie snake Harley's girlfriend.
I mean, we gave him love lessons, we hid in the locker, we told him what to say.
How is that not trouble?
OK, let me think.
Uh, protective custody, plastic surgery Ah!
We dress up as girls, pretend we're our out-of-town cousins and say we haven't seen ourselves.
- No, that'll never work.
- Oh, yeah?
Tell my Uncle Mary.
Harley!
How are ya?
Didn't I tell Frankie to dispose of you guys?
Yes, and he did.
He killed us - big time.
- And now we're the angels of ourselves.
- And it's time for us to float away.
Float float - Either of you angels see my girl?
- You mean Gloria?
No, we haven't seen her.
No, there's no reason we could have seen her.
We were in the locker the whole time.
The whole time what, boys?
Come on, Shawn Float float You know, Frankie, it's OK you don't have a lot to say.
Still waters run deep.
I'm an ocean an ocean of love for you.
No one ever said anything sweet like that to me before.
I cannot believe my eyes.
I am betrayed by my best girl and my most trusted flunky.
Maybe you just need some time alone.
My world is shattered.
I feel so vulnerable.
Think I'm going to have to kill somebody.
OK, everybody outta here!
Everybody except you two.
Us two, I guess, huh?
Frankie Hmm Gloria Imagine my surprise.
- Harley, I can explain.
- I look forward to hearing it.
I went behind your back and stole your girl.
I know this is a betrayal of a sacred trust, but I have no choice.
I am but a pawn of love.
How could you do this to me?
You wanna know how?
I'll tell you how.
All it took was somebody saying something nice to me for a change.
Making me feel special for a change.
I make you feel special.
I get you stuff.
What did you ever get me that made me feel special?
Tires!
Steel-belted.
- Three!
- The guy came back!
- You never think about what I like.
- I ain't got that kind of time.
Maybe you should've made some time.
Maybe if you cared about me and thought about me, instead of all the time thinking about you.
If I thought about you, who'd think about me, huh?
- Guys!
- What?
!
You know, every couple goes through this.
I mean, you're going through it, - my parents are going through it.
- Your parents do this?
Well, not quite as loud, but yeah.
See, my mom's mad at my dad because he got her a trash compactor for their anniversary.
What a yutz!
Oh, yeah, that's a long way away from tires.
So your parents, they gonna split up?
No.
I mean, they'll work it out.
They always do.
How?
I don't know.
But they always do?
Yeah.
- Mrs. Matthews?
- Yes I'm a school chum of your son.
- Eric?
- No, the little squirrelly one.
- Oh, Cory.
- Yeah, that's him.
My name is Harley Harley Keiner.
Oh, the Harley Keiner that everybody's afraid of?
You flatter me.
- What can I do for you?
- Yes, well, your son - Uh - Cory.
- Cory.
- Mm-hmm.
He indicated that you and your husband were having a spat similar to the one that I'm presently going through with my own better half.
Now, I would go to my own mother for advice, but, you see, it's four in the afternoon, so she's out cold.
Well, I don't see how I can really help you.
Please, ma'am, I got nobody else to go to.
No!
- Leave my mom alone, Keiner.
- Eric, what is the matter with you?
- Do you know who this is, Mom?
- Yes, I do.
And everything is under control.
- More tea, Harley?
- Just a smidge.
- OK.
- Hey there, Eric.
Harley Keiner's drinking tea in my kitchen.
What's going on?
It's personal and I don't think Harley wants to talk about it in front of you.
Oh, he's getting in touch with his inner thug?
Eric.
Mrs. Matthews, you've been married a few years, you probably have some insight.
What do women want?
Oh, it's pretty simple, Harley.
All women really want, is to be appreciated.
Do you think that maybe Gloria feels a little unappreciated?
- Who knows what she thinks.
- You should, you're her boyfriend.
Ah, jeez, Mrs. Matthews, I'm not so good with feelings and emotions and all that Ricki Lake stuff.
Feelings and emotions is what it's all about, Harley.
I'll bet you Gloria thinks a lot about you.
Well, who could blame her.
Then you should think about her.
How you feel about her, how much you appreciate her.
She's my girlfriend.
Isn't that enough?
I mean, why does she need to be appreciated all the time?
Because that's how you show people you care about them.
By thinking about what they want.
What would make them happy and By the way, who who are you?
Just a fella who took a wrong turn on the highway of love.
Been there.
So, Harley, you gonna talk to Gloria again?
No.
You were correct when you said I should think about what she wants.
And what she wants now is Frankie.
This is how it is to be.
I shall have to wait my turn and another chance for love.
Thanks, Mrs. M. - You're a lucky guy.
- Yeah, I know that.
But really, who are you?
- Harley Keiner.
- Oh, thank you.
- Listen, take me.
Just don't kill them.
- It's OK, baboon.
Death takes a holiday.
Well, nice meeting you, Harley.
Oh, uh the teacup.
Good eyes.
- What was he doing here?
- He had a girlfriend problem.
He didn't appreciate her enough.
Something that happens to you young guys, but not us seasoned veterans.
We know never to take the people we care about for granted.
We like to show them that every day together is a gift.
Happy anniversary, darling.
One for every year we're married.
That is so sweet.
But we've only been married 17 years.
One for the year we weren't married.
Oh, yeah, that was a good year.
Wait, what does that mean?
Guys, what does that mean?
Aw, get a room.
Hey, Matthews, I was just grading the Cyrano papers and I liked your work.
Well, that's not surprising, since I am Cyrano.
- Uh-huh.
- No, I'm serious.
- See them?
- Yeah.
I did the whole Cyrano bit.
I put them together.
Wait, you're saying you were in love with her, but you stepped aside for the other guy?
No, no I just hid in a locker and helped Frankie woo her.
- What?
- Woo her.
Oh, well, job well done, Matthews.
So, you think maybe there's some extra credit in this for me?
No, but tell me what you learned.
All right.
Love is something you can never take for granted.
So if you find someone you really, really care about, never buy her tires or major appliances.
Matthews, a very mature understanding on the mystery of love.
You are wise beyond your years.
Cory, you gotta come quick.
The girls volleyball team is running laps.
Oh, baby!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Football?
- No, no.
Pain.
Cleats on face.
- Modern dance?
- No.
Lotta girls.
Tights.
No.
- Drama club?
- No.
Lotta guys.
Tights.
No.
- That's the list, Cor.
- None of these are me, Shawn.
I mean, here I am, going into my eighth year of public education, - and who am I, really?
- You're you.
You're Cory Matthews.
Yeah, but there's no Cory Matthews club on here, there's no club for ordinary guys who don't know who they are - and aren't great at anything.
- So start one.
Oh, I probably wouldn't get in.
Cory, you got a lot of good qualities.
- Hey, you're honest, loyal and decent.
- Housebroken, too.
I'm a stinkin' beagle.
All right, people, this just off the wire.
Elections for next year's eighth-grade class president will be held next week.
Who cares?
Detention!
Sorry!
Too many people whine and moan about the way things run around here.
Well, this is a chance to change things by getting involved.
But remember, this is a student election it's not a popularity contest.
I think we've been spending a little too much time together.
The point is, your class president doesn't need to be a quarterback or a cheerleader.
You'll be much better off with someone who's honest, loyal and decent.
- Cory, that's you.
- What?
You wanted to know who you were.
You could be president.
- Come on.
- All right, let's have some nominations.
I got somebody good.
I nominate me.
Your humility is impressive, Meese, but someone else has to nominate you.
- Topanga, how about it?
- No, go away, and don't look at me.
Come on, Meese here has the guts to run.
Someone should have the guts to nominate him.
All right, big deal.
I'll nominate him.
What are you doing?
That's your competition.
- I'm not running.
- Anybody else?
The great state of Shawn nominates the people's choice Cory Matthews.
- No!
- No!
He's not gonna settle for second-rate leadership.
Matthews, you've been nominated.
Do you accept?
- No way.
- No way would he turn down a chance to serve his fellow students.
What are you, his handler?
- Yes, I am.
- No, he's not.
Look, I don't know anything about being president, OK?
I wouldn't have a clue.
I'm not somebody special.
I'm just an average guy like all of you, the simple, hard-working students who struggle day after day with too much homework, unfair teachers, and an antiquated justice system that relies too much on detention.
And if elected if I win and you guys vote for me I would say to each and every one of you, "Hey, thanks"!
You got something, man.
You could really win this.
Yeah, but Shawn, there are like and I don't even know most of them.
That's why we have to take your message from the lunchrooms to the bathrooms, from the halls to the stalls.
We have to tell everybody who you are!
- But I'm not anybody.
- Say it again.
- I'm not anybody.
- That's what they like.
You're not some handsome, smart, popular guy.
You're not cool.
- You're not even halfway - Hey!
I got it.
Thank you.
You're on my side, right?
There is no other side.
I'm gonna put together a campaign like this school has never seen, an unstoppable tidal wave, gathering snow, blazing through the sky, crushing everything in its beak.
You're getting off on this, aren't you?
I gotta say I am.
This is Cory Matthews' campaign commercial, directed by me.
The following is paid for by Citizens to Elect Cory, which so far is just me.
Action!
Cory Matthews loyal, honest, decent, a leader who dares to say Hey, I'm average.
Why, hello there, young lady.
And what do you think of me?
Hi, Cory.
Tell me how you plan to make this school a more effective institution for the entire student body.
Well, that's a very Shawn!
Cut!
Topanga, could you please just read what I wrote out for you?
Yeah, like I'm gonna say, "Cory's cute and cuddly.
That's what's important to me as a girl.
" - What?
- This is not how I think.
This is not how any girl thinks.
And there's no "m" in "cuddly.
" Topanga, please, Shawn knows what he's doing.
- No.
No, I don't.
- What?
Really.
She's right.
I should have been more sensitive to our female brothers.
Tell you what.
These these are gone.
I want you to say whatever you think needs to be said as a human being who just happens to be female.
- Apology accepted.
- Before you start, could you wet your lips?
You are so sleazy.
What?
What?
OK.
The idea here is that you and your brother share a common bond - brotherhood.
We want to show that to the voters.
So basically you just want to see me being an older brother.
There you go.
OK, action!
- Hey, Cor!
- Hey, there, older brother.
You know, Cor, I was just sitting here thinking, what makes my little brother special?
What sets him apart from the other seventh-grade candidates?
Is it his allergy to scallops?
Eric.
- Is it his Scooby-Doo thermos?
- Where'd you find that?
No, I think it's his fuzzy bunny pajamas with the cottontail.
I haven't worn these for years, I swear.
Boinky, boinky, boinky.
Vote for me!
Vote for me!
- Boinky, boinky, boinky - Cut!
Oh!
Hey, guys, whatcha doin'?
- Cut!
- Campaign commercial.
- Is this your script?
- No, no, n "It's morning at Cory's house and Cory's having pizza for breakfast.
"Yes, Cory does pretty much whatever he wants.
Why?
Because his parents are dead.
" Shawn wrote it.
- Mrs. Matthews, I could lie to you.
- Oh, why stop now?
Our research shows that parents are not thought of as cool, so if we can position Cory as being "on his own," individual, independent, we increase his level of cool.
And, Cor, how cool do you feel about the recent demise of your parents?
It's just temporary, Mom.
I mean, as soon as I'm elected, you and Dad will be found living amongst the bears in the Oregon woods.
OK.
Mr. McGruder, I don't care to hear what your little brother tore up or what your dog ate.
I want your paper on my desk by first bell tomorrow or else.
- You'll give me an F. - I'll give you a G. As in, "Gee, if I'd just done my work on time, I wouldn't be the only 40-year-old in the 7th grade.
" Ta-ta.
- He's not human.
- You want him gone?
- Can you do that?
- Cory can.
If he's elected, Feeny's gone.
You can do that?
If that's what you want, that's what Cory will do.
Spread the word.
Shawn, I want to win too, but in what part of your diseased mind does the eighth-grade class president get to fire the principal?
Cory, come on.
It's just a campaign promise.
It's what you say to get elected.
Now, repeat after me.
Give the people what they want.
Yeah, but I Give the people what they want Give the people what they want.
And if teachers get paid for teaching, then students should get paid for learning.
Yeah!
And this homework thing what is that about?
If they can't teach enough during school hours, - why is that our problem?
- Yeah!
- This guy may be cheesier than we are.
- What do we do?
We break out the heavy cheese.
Let me tell you something, my friends.
How can you believe anything this guy says?
He's got straight A's.
He's been making you look dumb for years.
Can you really trust this this curve breaker?
- Curve breaker!
- Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
Curve!
Talk to 'em, Cory.
Tell 'em what they want to hear.
Curve breaker!
Curve breaker!
My fellow students, there are many challenging issues which currently face John Adams High, issues that seemingly have no solutions And I say there'd be fewer problems if we spent less time here.
I mean, what's the deal with this five-day school week?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty much shot by Wednesday, so let's end the week there.
If I'm president, Thursdays and Fridays are part of the weekend.
Yeah!
- Mondays are optional.
- Yeah!
- Tuesdays, come in prepared to learn.
- Yeah!
We are the future!
Hey, you can't make five-day weekends.
Yeah, well, you can't pay kids for going to school.
- Are you questioning my integrity?
- Yeah, we are.
Well, I question yours, and I have proof.
Nobody move.
Shawn, he doesn't have anything on us, does he?
No, it's a bluff.
It's gotta be.
Listen, man, a lot of weird stuff goes on in the trailer park.
When do you step in and teach them the democratic process?
If Matthews wins, Tuesday.
Mr. Turner, all I'm hearing from your little election are ridiculous promises and character assassination.
Too much like the real thing, George?
Yes, but don't we aspire for their generation to do better?
Yeah, we do.
But we can't just tell them what to do.
They have to learn for themselves.
So you believe in letting them make their own mistakes?
Yeah, I do.
I don't think that's a bad way to go.
Nor I. In fact, I have that philosophy toward a certain young teacher that I know.
What, you mean me?
Voters and voterettes, this poor, exploited young woman is named Paula, and she has a sordid story to tell.
Go ahead, Paula.
Tell them what you told me.
I was in third grade with Shawn Hunter.
One day, he and I were standing near the monkey bars, and I can't go on.
Go ahead, Paula.
Be strong.
Well, Shawn said that that all girls were icky!
Oh, God, come on.
I never said that.
You wrote it on my notebook.
"All girls are icky.
" Give me a break.
I was only eight.
I didn't like girls then, but I love them now.
- So you changed your mind?
- Of course.
- Flip-flop.
- What?
Flip-flop.
He changes his mind about girls.
Who knows what he's gonna change his mind about next?
- Flip-flopper.
- Flip-flopper!
Flip-flopper!
- Flip-flopper - Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait.
Shawn's not even running here.
- But he represents you, doesn't he?
- I sure do.
Then Cory, are you prepared to drop out of the race?
- No.
- Are you prepared to drop your flip-flopping one-time sexist campaign manager?
All I want is justice.
Shawn has to go.
- Shawn must go!
- Shawn must go!
- Shawn must go!
- Wait a minute.
Don't you guys want a president who's loyal to his friends 1000 percent?
No!
- Really?
That's what you guys want?
- Yes!
Then Shawn is out.
Yeah!
How could you do this to me?
Did you hear them cheer, Shawn?
I think we picked up a lot of girl votes.
You said we were weak on girls.
Cory, you fired me.
- Well, yeah, just a little.
- No.
No, no, it was all of me.
But I had to.
We're in this to win, right?
"We"?
"We"?
"We"?
!
- Shawn, you're squealing.
- Yeah, I'm squealing.
That's the sound you make when your best friend takes a gun and stabs you in the back right in front of your eyes.
Look, I just did what you told me to.
I gave the people what they wanted.
- Well, I want my campaign back.
- Yeah, since when was it your campaign?
Only since I nominated you and told you what to say every step of the way.
You were helpful in the early going, and I'll never forget that.
You fired me.
Shawn, my friend, this is not a time for bitterness.
This is a time for healing.
You know what, Cory Matthews?
If I met you just this minute, I wouldn't know who you are.
I'm Cory Matthews, the next president of the eighth grade.
Not without me, pal.
So how's the campaign?
We're just reevaluating, you know, considering a new direction.
Mm-hmm.
And that would be down?
Look, Shawn was just holding me back.
Yeah, you're right.
It's probably a good move to dump your best friend for a dopey class election you're gonna lose anyway.
You know what?
You're jealous, huh?
You're used to being the big man Mr. Rugby Shirt, Mr. Good Hair, Mr. Dimples.
Oh, stop.
Stop.
When I'm president, people are gonna look at you, and you know what they're gonna say?
Who's sitting next to Cory?
Who's that giving Cory the ride home?
Who's the guy with photos of little Cory running naked through the sprinkler?
Eric, big deal.
I was four.
You were 12.
It was refreshing.
Cory, it's late.
What are you doing up?
I'm just working on my speech for tomorrow's debate.
- Hey, Cor?
- Yeah?
How are you gonna get 'em to shoot Baywatch at your school?
- Well, we have a pool.
- No, you don't.
Keep reading.
Ah.
Oh, and a water slide.
Oh, nice touch.
What are you gonna call it?
Raging Promises?
Dad, it's just to get elected.
Once I win, then I'll do the real stuff clean up the graffiti, get better food in the cafeteria, just be an all-around voice for the students.
That sounds pretty good.
Why don't you put some of that in here?
Because it's boring, and nobody votes for boring.
They want to hear what you're gonna give 'em.
Even if that's not really what you're gonna give 'em?
Dad, you don't sound like you're behind me on this.
Cory, I'm always behind you.
I'm just not sure I'm behind what you're saying here.
I'm just trying to win.
- Why is that so important?
- So I can be president.
- Why do you want to be president?
- Because then I'll finally fit in and be the person I want to be.
Who do you want to be?
Cory Matthews honest, loyal, decent.
Honest to the voters, loyal to your best friend, and decent enough to kill off your parents.
After this morning's debate, you will return to your homerooms and cast your votes for eighth-grade class president.
Now, the candidates.
Alvin W. Meese.
Alvin!
Alvin!
And Cory A. Matthews.
Slim pickin's indeed.
We will now hear opening statements.
- Slight change of plans.
- You said I could be moderator.
Well, now there's even more to moderate.
Oh.
All right.
Technically we never closed the nomination process, and so, as of just now, there's a new candidate for president.
Oh, good.
Perhaps a serious-minded student appalled by the tawdry level of the campaign thus far.
Shawn Hunter.
I quit.
How you doing?
Vote for me.
Vote for me.
Shawn, what are you doing?
What I should have done in the first place - run for president myself.
Can he do this?
Mr. Turner, this is your little experiment in democracy.
- Can he do this?
- I don't see why not.
Democracy is always invigorated by the infusion of fresh, new ideas.
Do you have any ideas, Mr. Hunter?
Oh, yeah.
Big honkin' ones.
"Big honkin' ones.
" So, flip-flopper, call any girls "icky" lately?
Thank you for bringing that up, Alvin.
Yes, I I have made some mistakes in the past.
I have called some girls icky, but that was a long time ago, when I had cooties.
That's right.
That's right.
I, Shawn Hunter, had cooties, but I fought my way back, and I stand before you today cootie-free and girl-friendly.
And to prove that, I'd like to introduce to you my co-candidate for president Paula Kelly.
- Aww.
- Can he do this?
- Can he do this?
- I don't see why not.
- Democracy is always- - Oh, be quiet.
How far are you willing to let this go?
I have faith in these students and the electoral process, and maybe just another minute.
Shawn Hunter's only in this race so he can get back at me for firing him.
And you're only in it because you didn't know who you were.
Well, I know who I am now.
I'm Cory Matthews, man of the people.
OK, man of the people, didn't you lie to the people?
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Didn't you make them outrageous campaign promises you knew you couldn't possibly deliver?
Yeah, only 'cause you told me to.
If I told you to jump off a bridge, would you listen to me?
Yeah, I did that one time.
Don't you remember?
How can you vote for a guy who's dumb enough to jump off a bridge?
It was a miniature golf bridge.
He jumped in to get my ball, and don't call my friend dumb.
Yeah, there's no room in this campaign for name-calling, you four-eyed, frog-voiced geek.
My mother does not buy my clothes.
I resign.
Hey, nice outfit!
Order.
Order!
This has all gone far enough.
Go back to your classrooms and cast your votes for the remaining candidates, and may God have mercy on your souls.
Wait a minute, Mr. Feeny.
Before they vote, shouldn't they hear what we have to say?
No.
Look, I just want to say that before this election, I really didn't know who I was or what was important to me, but now, weeks later, after looking deeply into my soul, I still have no idea.
I know less than he knows.
Thank you, Mr. Lincoln, but wait your turn.
So I ran for president to find out who I was, and what I think I'm finding out is that I'm not a good candidate or a good friend.
So I withdraw from the race, and I think everyone here should vote for Shawn.
He's really the best friend you could have.
No, I'm not.
I'm worse than you.
I made up every lie he told.
I've known Cory all my life, and he really is honest, loyal and decent.
That's what you are, Cor.
That's all you need to be.
I withdraw from the race, too.
Well, Mr. Feeny, we're both out.
Yes, well, I'm sure you'll do well in the private sector.
Wait a second.
I wanted to be president.
I wanted my life to mean something.
- You want to go grab a burger?
- I'm out.
Well, Mr. Turner, your little experiment in democracy has left the eighth grade leaderless for next year.
Too bad.
I was looking forward to Matthews' five-day weekend.
OK, folks, that's our show.
Thank you for coming.
We now return you to your regular Friday schedule.
Wait a minute.
Our class needs a leader.
And if we ignore all our problems, they're not just going to go away.
There's graffiti all over the walls, and those old social studies books?
When are they gonna replace those?
And how about some better food in the cafeteria?
And if elected, I will be a voice for the entire student body.
She's got my vote.
You know, she would make a great president.
Yeah, I knew it would all work out.
- Do you realize how lucky you are?
- Yes, sir.
Very lucky.
What we really need is someone who will work hard to make small but real changes that will make a meaningful difference in our daily lives.
Honest, loyal, decent - What about a water slide?
- You got it.
- And the power means nothing to her.
- Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Topanga!
Cory seemed pretty quiet during dinner.
Yeah, at least we didn't have to listen to any campaign promises.
Poor little guy.
He would have made such a cute president.
I think he's better off.
- I'm kind of proud of him for dropping out.
- I didn't know he dropped out.
Made a bunch of promises he couldn't keep, and it finally caught up to him.
Good lesson to be learned.
You cannot make promises like that.
People remember.
Yeah, like when you promised to take me to Europe.
Exactly.
Do you remember when you said that?
Yes, I do.
I remember we were, um - sitting at that place - That's right.
We were drinking that wine and eating all those strawberries, and you said, "Sweetheart, one day I'm going to take you to Paris, I promise.
" And that's a promise I'm gonna keep.
This summer.
Paris.
You can book the tickets.
Ohh, Alan.
Paris.
You and me, babe.
Mom, did Dad really promise to take you to Paris?
Of course he did just now.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
"Stephanie and Todd invite you to a dinner party at Todd's place.
Couples only.
" Shawn, that's discrimination.
It leaves out a lot of people who have committed themselves to the single life.
People like you and me.
Huh?
People like me.
Remember in health class, that section on the movement of blood?
I understand it now.
Fine, bail on your best friend.
Cory, just ask a girl and you can go too.
Look, there's Wendy.
You know her, you like her Ask her to be your girlfriend.
Just for the party?
That's not right.
It is right.
You're supposed to do that.
You're thinking too much.
Do what I do - don't think.
- Wendy?
Hi!
- Oh, hi, Cory.
Listen, Stephanie and Todd are having this party and I was wondering if you'd like to go with me?
Well, Cory, this invitation says "couples only.
" Oh, that.
Well, if we went to the party together, then we'd be a couple.
I think you're just looking for a date.
- No, I'd really like to go with you.
- So you want to be a couple with me?
Sure.
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.
I do too.
This is wonderful, Cory.
- Is it OK if I go tell my friends?
- Sure, and I'll tell all of mine.
Shawn!
Hey, look at me, I'm a couple.
Look at me, I'm alone.
And you will be until theses grades come up.
Until I see some letters closer to the front of the alphabet, you're not going out on any more dates.
Mom Mommy Oh, Alan, how can you be so cruel to my sweet little baby?
Well, it was your idea.
Eric, you can't rely on your looks to get you through life.
But all I want to be is a weatherman.
Look, you guys made a valid point about my grades.
I'd like the opportunity to present a compelling counter-argument - you may not have considered.
- Go ahead.
Don't take away my girls!
- Cory!
- Oh, Wendy.
Hi!
Cory, I wanted to tell you that spending time with you this week - well, has been the best week of my life.
- Mine too.
- See ya.
- Oh!
Wait, silly, dilly.
I wanted to ask you Where you gonna be this summer?
Ah, this summer?
I don't know, it's so far off.
Why?
Well, since we're a couple, I was looking forward to spending the summer together.
Well, why don't we wait and see how the spring goes first.
OK.
You know, spring is when love blooms.
I did not know that.
Thank you.
Oh, listen, Wendy, can we talk about this later?
- I've got - Chemistry.
Yeah.
Boy, you know my schedule better than me.
You're so cute.
And now, straighten your collar and off you go.
Cory Didn't you forget something?
No, goose Kiss, kiss.
Mr. Turner, remember, mid-term grades are due next Friday.
I thought I'd give everybody A's.
That way the parents are happy, the kids are happy- nobody gets hurt.
Hurt them.
You know, I was a bit of a squash player in my day.
I'm sure you were.
What does that have to do with racquetball?
Oh, of course.
My goodness.
I guess I'm out of touch with current recreational sports.
No, actually, from what I've seen on old engravings on the History Channel, squash and racquetball are really quite similar.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Same basic principle?
- Oh, yeah.
I'm sure an old squash player like yourself would pick it up in no time.
I'd certainly like to get in step with the times.
I'm playing a friend today, how about tomorrow I take you out and show you how?
That would give you enough time to get a doctor's note.
You're a funny guy.
You think there's room on the court for my respirator?
What a chump.
Hi, Eric.
- Eric, it's me.
Lori.
- I know who it is.
- Be kind and move on.
- My parents are out of town.
And I've been having trouble adjusting the temperature on my hot tub.
I thought maybe you could come over and help me get the heat up.
Lori, if you had any feelings for me, go home, get ugly.
OK, I'll ask Phil.
Lockerheadman, I heard your signal and came as quickly as I could.
I'm going nuts.
The more I try to study, the more I think about girls.
Look at this.
History, perfect example.
Look at this Queen Victoria Catherine the Great, Madame Curie Are they yummy or what?
Yummy!
Oh, and who is this raven-haired beauty?
That's Leonardo da Vinci.
Stop that, you're scaring me.
Come here.
I happen to know of a parentally acceptable, highly satisfying dating substitute.
There's no such thing.
- Fine.
- Help me!
A haircut.
That's your girl substitute?
So if I was starving, would you buy me pants?
Thank you.
But I don't need a haircut, all right?
- I'm outta here.
- I think you need a haircut more than you need anything in your entire life.
- Why?
- Hello, Jason, you're back so soon.
Hello, Dominique.
Oh and who is this silky head of hair, hm?
Eric Matthews.
Eric Matthews.
My friend, Eric.
- He needs the full scalp treatment.
- He's scalp treatment.
He's cute.
Come with me - sit.
There you go.
You know, I like your friend.
- You ready?
- Uh-huh.
OK.
Mmm Oh You have very soft hair, Eric.
- Very full - Thank you.
- OK, there we go.
- Goodbye goodbye.
Hi, Cory.
Oh, Bunny Hi.
Can you help me with my English homework?
- Sorry, I can't tonight.
- Oh What's with the girls in our English class?
That's like the fifth one who's asked me for help with homework.
- Cor, are you that clueless?
- Clueless?
Obviously I'm the one who knows what the homework is.
They don't want homework, they want you.
- Why?
- Because you're a couple.
You're off the market.
They can't have you, they want you more.
- What sense does that make?
- You're hot, use it.
Go for it.
- What about Wendy?
- How long you been going out with her?
- All week.
- Oh break up!
Why?
Wendy's so cute.
She's adorable, she likes me.
You are so superficial end at this minute.
- Why?
- Because a week's too long to be going out with the same person.
She starts waiting for you outside your class, she knows your schedule.
In one extreme case, I even heard of a girl who wanted to know what the guy was doing next summer.
What a loser.
- So you got the breakup note?
- Yeah.
But I just want to wait for the right moment to give it to her.
She knows the breakup's coming.
She's waiting for it.
She probably wants it more than you.
Hi, Cory, I bought you socks.
It's a lovely parting gift.
Hey, everybody!
Do I have everybody's poem on my desk here?
Ah, thank you.
I thought what we'd do is read a few of them and then we'll discuss them, OK?
OK, the first one up is Shawn Hunter.
His poem is called "Welfare.
" OK.
You want me to read this out loud, or just forward it to the guidance counselor?
Read it.
It's some of my best work.
OK, everybody, buckle up.
"My uncle Ralph, he does not care "'Cause twice a month he gets welfare "My uncle Chuck has nylon hair "He bought the rug with his welfare.
"Old Corvair, long nose hair, electric chair.
" That's a very colorful family you got there, Shawn.
I didn't use their real names.
That's OK, right?
Oh, yeah.
The less I know, the better.
- Give her the note.
- Oh, right.
- OK, moving on - Psst.
Wendy Ah, here's one written by Wendy Jansen.
It's called "Leave me and I'll die.
" - Wendy, I need that back.
- Shh!
"Love is a flower that blooms in the sun "Our love runs deeper than deep rivers run "Our love is so strong that it makes me cry Leave me and I'll die, I will die die die " - You think I can have the note back?
- Oh, the note - right.
No, don't!
May I be excused?
- What's going on?
- We both had a lot of ice tea at lunch.
Wendy, I'm really sorry.
The note I may not have said what I was hoping you'd think I meant to say.
- You mean you don't want to break up?
- No!
I mean, what gave you that idea?
"I think we should break up.
" Should not Not.
Does this look like the face of a guy who wants to break up?
I just love your face.
- You do?
- Yes.
Then everything's gonna be OK?
Well, I need a hug.
I hope our kids turn out as sensitive as you.
Me too.
Our what?
!
So, did you or did you not break up with Wendy?
No, but I have a plan.
I'm gonna call her up and tell her things are moving a little fast, and I just need a few days by myself to think things over.
It's a good plan.
How could it not work?
Hi Cory.
Hey, Cor, look who's here.
It's Wendy and she's holding a knife.
Guess who's fixing us dinner tonight?
Amy, these are terrific scallop potatoes.
I just mentioned to Wendy that they were Cory's favorite and she just whipped them up from scratch.
Maybe I could come over again and show you how to make them?
- I'm sure I would like that.
- I'm sure I'd like that too.
In fact, why don't we invite Wendy to move in and we could become one big happy potato-eating family.
Well, I don't just make potatoes, Cory.
I can make fun stuff like Belgian waffles.
With whipped cream and strawberries?
- Whatever you like.
- Ooh.
My grandmother makes them for my grandfather.
They've been together for 66 years.
I'm on an emotional roller coaster.
So you think she'll have an opening tomorrow?
- I can call.
- Call now.
- Hey, guys, where you been?
- Hey, I can get a haircut, as many as I want!
Eric is cut Let's go, How bad is this?
Let me finish dinner and then I'll assess.
- The well-groomed boy there was - Eric and his friend, Jason.
Cory's told me so much about him.
When?
I hope our three kids turn out as wonderfully as yours have.
You decided on three children?
I'm one of three children and Cory's one of three children so I thought we'd keep the tradition alive.
Three kids What do you think of that, gramps?
Uh could you, uh Come, Cory with me over - Nut case?
- Ya think?
Oh, Wendy Uh, don't you think that three children on Cory's five-dollar-a-week allowance might be a little stressful during the holidays?
Mr. Matthews, we're not going to get married anytime soon.
We both have a lot of growing up to do.
- Well, I'm glad to hear that.
- Mm, let her finish.
- We're just going to grow up together.
- Wanna go outside again?
Uh When you and Cory are married, will you be my sister?
That's right.
Ooh she's got Morgan.
That is just so completely sweet.
Ahh she's got all the women.
- Want to see my dolls, sis?
- I'd like that.
- Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Sure.
Of course, dear.
Make yourself at home.
Yeah, move in.
OK, OK, family meeting.
What the heck did you bring home?
She let her in.
Come on.
She's just a little girl playing house.
Amy, sweetheart, she's a little blonde loon.
Nonsense!
Look, if I thought there was anything to be concerned about, I would be the first one to sound the alarm.
Mrs. Matthews, I found this picture of you in your wedding dress Maybe someday I'll get to try it on.
Beep, beep, beep, beep Come on, Jonathan.
Young minds waiting to be taught.
Yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Our little match didn't take it all out of you, did it?
Oh, yeah, you're some piece of work, George.
"Oh, I don't know how I will adapt to this vastly different game " "Am I standing the right way?
Oh, look, another point for me.
" I believe it was your idea to make a small wager on the outcome.
You're old, I though you'd lose.
And I cleaned your clock.
So?
Yeah, you took me.
You hustled me.
Yes, I did.
Oh, by the way, Jonathan I don't shoot pool either.
So after she made us desert and read to us, I walked her home.
And right there on the porch, I laid it out.
I said, "Wendy, it's over - forever.
" How'd she react?
She invited me in for oatmeal cookies, Grandma Jansen played the organ, and we all sang "Big Rock Candy Mountain.
" It's nice knowin' ya.
You know they have four generations living in the same house?
The men don't say much.
Listen, man, I've got class.
Stay here.
I'll come back and get you.
- You sure you're OK?
- Yes, dear, I'm very happy.
I don't have to think about anything for the rest of my life.
- Cory, sweetheart, what are you doing?
- What?
!
- We don't have to steal the dinner rolls.
- Oh, they want you to take the rolls.
No, they don't.
At the prices they charge, they're lucky we don't take the silverware.
I know why someone's cranky.
I'll have the waitress bring some prunes.
Cory!
Is that you?
Shawn, who else would it be?
You know I come here everyday, And everyday you ask, "Cory, is that you"?
- My mind's not as sharp as it used to be.
- I've got news, Shawn - it never was.
- How's the fish?
- Nice.
You know, Shawn, I used to envy you.
Since we was young, you've dated thousands of women and I've been married to Wendy for the past 90 years.
- Has it been that long?
- Oh, yeah.
Did you know that the 90th anniversary is the potato anniversary?
No, I didn't.
How long you been married?
- Who?
!
- What?
!
They want you to take the rolls!
You and Wendy a beautiful girl, who's been by your side since you were 13.
And here I am, at the twilight of my life alone But maybe not tonight.
That girl, she's moving pretty fast.
Miss Ludwig!
Oh, prunes.
This should get me through the day.
Honey, did you miss me?
Miss you?
You haven't been out of my sight for the past 90 years.
Cory, has it been that awful?
Wendy, as I look back on the past 90 years together, and see how you gave me a wonderful home, three or four beautiful children, your left kidney and a pair of beautiful socks.
Did you like them?
Have I ever taken them off?
- No.
- That's love.
So I just want to say, thank you for loving me and giving me a wonderful life.
Empty your pockets, Mr. Matthews.
- What?
!
- Stealing the dinner rolls again.
- And the Sweet'N Low.
- I didn't take any Sweet'N Low.
What's in that pocket?
I bought these.
Mr. Matthews Mr. Matthews!
- OK, but I only took three bags.
- Mr. Matthews!
This is coming out of your tip.
Here's a tip for you Get to class.
Oh, I'm late.
My wife is going to be so upset.
Here's your food, sweetheart.
I didn't get any cheese on our burgers because you tell me it's no good for me.
And no red meat either.
See, just the buns.
I just want what's best for you, Cory.
Yeah, I know.
I know, you're just thinking of me.
Ever since we first sat in this booth and you asked me to be a couple with you.
Yeah You know, that seems funny now.
Why?
I guess it doesn't matter now, but when I first asked you out I wasn't looking for a lifelong relationship.
- I just needed a date for the party.
- But that's not what you told me.
Yeah, but Shawn told me I'm supposed to go out with lots of girls, 'cause that's the right thing to do and that's what girls want too.
Cory, it's over.
- What?
- Our relationship is over.
- Why?
- Because it's been based on a lie and that's not something I want to be a part of.
But what about our three kids?
What about our life together and all the waffles?
I'm sorry, Cory, but it doesn't mean anything if it's not something we both really wanted.
Hi!
- Hey, Cory, where's Wendy going?
- We broke up.
- She let you go?
- Yep, for good.
All right!
Free man again on the prowl.
Tell you what.
Tonight, you and me, the Wolensky twins.
Party 'till we drop.
Whaddya say?
- No, you go.
- Why?
Because I miss Wendy.
- I don't understand?
- It's over.
- I can't see you anymore.
- But you're in the book.
No, no, no, no, no Come sit.
We'll talk while I shampoo.
No!
No, Dominique!
Look What we had was wrong and I have to walk out of here with a dry head.
But one quick rinse.
No one has to know.
I'd know!
Dominique Don't you see one of us has to be strong and it has to be me.
So don't make me do something we're both gonna regret.
Eric, you're making me angry.
I will be very rough with you.
OK.
Good boy.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
OK, Eric, define the powers of the legislative branch.
The legislative branch is responsible for kissing the area below the nose.
- We have a test tomorrow.
- You're absolutely right and I'm sick and tired of you holding me back.
Let's get some serious work done here.
You know when you concentrate, you get this cute little furled brow.
Hey, hey, hey There'll be plenty of time for that and much more on the weekend.
How about right here, Saturday?
Oh, wish I could, but my cousin's in from out of town and - I have to hang with her all weekend.
- I understand.
Ditch her.
- She's 13 years old.
- Ditch her at the zoo.
- I can't get out of it.
- OK.
Well, tell you what.
How about if we double?
Just so happens I have a 13-year-old brother - who's currently available.
- Mmmm what's your brother like?
Cory's 13.
What do you need?
Well, Laurie's from Manhattan and she's very mature for her age.
Oh, then you're gonna love Cory.
You would not believe how mature he is.
Ha-ha!
Hey, guys, look at me, I'm a fountain.
I gotta show Shawn.
Shawn!
OK, forget about Cory.
What about the squeegee guy by the bus station?
It's no big deal.
We'll just get together in two weeks.
No.
I'll talk to Cory.
He'll be fine.
He won't do the fountain.
He won't blow milk bubbles out of his nose.
He won't even do armpit theater.
Not interupting.
Just passing through to get a drink.
As you were.
- Who was that?
- That'd be Cory's friend Shawn.
- So he'd be 13 too?
- Uh-huh.
I didn't really want a drink.
I just heard Eric was down here with an unbelievably gorgeous girl.
And I gotta say, as I stand here with my own eyes, it was worth the trip.
Thank you!
Once again, as you were.
How about him for my cousin?
- Shawn?
- Yeah.
No.
Cory's my brother.
I don't want to dump my little brother.
I think my cousin would have a good time with Shawn.
And if my cousin has a good time, we could have a good time.
No, Cory's my brother.
Cory's my blood.
Shawn has blood.
Ah, Mr. Turner, a reminder.
Our faculty advisor meeting is today at 4:00.
Today?
Really?
Is that the one where we get saddled with all those terrible after-school, life-sapping clubs?
Oh, please, let it be that meeting.
- Yes, that's the one.
- I don't wanna go.
Well, unfortunately, you have no choice about what meetings you go to, Mr. Picky.
I'll see you at 4:00.
- Shawn, bud - I didn't do it.
I don't know where he is.
I don't have a dime.
Stop clenching.
I'm gonna do you a favor.
How'd you like to go on a double date with me, Kim and Kim's cousin?
- Why don't you ask Cory?
- Cory?
You don't think I'd ask my brother first?
Is that what you think of me?
No, no, no.
I don't think anything of you.
All right, then.
- So, what's she look like?
- Gorgeous, spectacular.
Like Elle MacPherson with Cindy Crawford's mind.
- You haven't seen her yet, have you?
- I'm paying.
She's just my type.
So where are we going?
- I'm paying.
- I love it there!
We need someone for the senior ski trip.
You look like you could handle yourself through a strenuous weekend of physical exertion.
Am I right?
- Only if you come with me, Dot.
- All right.
Chess Club Advisor - that would be George.
Why?
What?
Why "of course"?
You said "of course.
" Why did you say "of course"?
I I just assumed that you would That the little man in the sweater-vest better not stray too far from the dry cleaners?
What are you getting so hot about?
It's just clubs.
Any by the way, nice sweater-vest.
You just automatically assume that because I dress this way, because I speak this way, that I was born to lead the chess club?
Yeah, of course.
You're principal.
You want another club, you say the word.
I don't want another club.
I just want everybody to stop assuming around here, that's all.
I move that we all stop assuming anything.
Of course, you probably assumed I was gonna do that.
Wow Sorry, honey.
I would've been home sooner, but they took a little longer with me at the hairdresser No big deal.
I ran the house real good.
The kids had beer nuts for dinner, and now they're playing video games in the bathtub.
Father of the year.
Mmm thank you.
I'm off to my poker game.
Have a nice time and thanks a lot for the compliment on my hair.
Oh, yeah, your hair.
It's really nice the way they got it You know, the way they always get it like before.
Honey, it's very different.
I got a weave this time.
Really?
'Cause it looks just like the way they always get it.
You know, like they got it before.
Well, it shouldn't, 'cause I paid a fortune for this.
You have my undivided attention.
Actually, it didn't cost as much as you might think.
I'm thinking a dollar?
Exactly!
I paid a dollar.
Now go play poker.
Beer, dirty jokes I'll bet ya they're telling some right now.
- How much?
- I don't remember.
Let me help you remember.
You probably wrote it down in your checkbook.
and 30.
$130?
!
For a haircut?
Does does that include airfare?
Honey, that is what Rodique charges.
Well, tell him to stop and get some of your money back!
- Oh, I can't do that.
- Yeah, 'cause his name is Rodique.
Well, next time you go to someone named Fred.
He'll charge you $20 and you can read Playboys.
- Go play poker now.
- $130 Oh, yes, I love you,too.
All right - Hey, Joe.
- Hey, how you doin', Curly?
What do you got for a single guy out on the town?
Envy, my friend.
Not tonight, Chubb.
I'm flying solo, just like you.
Why aren't you hangin' around with your pal Potsie?
- I looked.
I can't find him anywhere.
- Let's see who Chubbie can find.
- 41!
- 41, that's me.
Potsie!
- Chubbie, that's amazing.
- Nah.
You want to see amazing?
Hey, Chubbie, you got any pie with that burger?
- You don't need it, King.
- OK, thanks.
- But don't tell anybody I was here.
- Zip.
- So Cory, how ya doin'?
- I tried calling you.
- Where you been?
- I've been here.
As it happens, I'm in mid-date.
- Oh, yeah?
Anybody I know?
- No, she's imported from New York.
The windy city.
- So, can I check her out?
- Sure, come on over.
Shawn, don't take this the wrong way, but your date looks a whole lot like my brother.
Hey, Cor.
She's got the voice down too.
- So, what's going on?
- Eric and I are doubling.
- The girls are just in the bathroom.
- Oh, you're doubling?
Yeah, you know, on the date you couldn't make.
- The date I couldn't make?
- Uh, Shawn Ha-ha!
You forgot the drinks.
Here you go.
Oh, yeah.
See, he he forgot the drinks.
So, Cor, only seven months to your birthday, huh?
Eric, tell me about the date I couldn't make.
It's not a date, like you know date.
It's just kinda me and Shawn and Kim and Kim's cousin from New York.
Just having dinner.
But enough about me.
What do you want for your birthday?
Eric, I want the truth.
Why wouldn't you ask me to come on the date with you?
Hey, not now, the girls are coming.
- Kim, you remember Cory?
- I'm your brother.
What's wrong with me?
Oh, yeah.
You're the little boy who spits water.
He spits water?
Why does he spit water?
- For attention, I guess.
- Is it funny?
Could I see it?
Would you show it to me?
I'm not feeling real funny right now, but I gotta head out, so you guys just go back to your date.
- Oh, come on, Cor - Eric, I'm fine, OK?
Let's not push how fine I am.
Cory, you upset with me?
Cory?
- Cory.
Come on, Cory.
- Eric, it's fine.
And thanks for remembering my name.
Hey, Cory, you're still awake.
Yeah, Mom and Dad always let me stay up a little later than Morgan.
That's good.
Pretty funny running into you at Chubbie's, huh?
Funny like a clown funny?
Look, Cor, it's a really complicated situation.
Eric, how complicated is it that I'm your brother?
I mean, how tough is it to think of me?
- Kim didn't exactly want you.
- She didn't?
No, but I swear I thought of you right off the bat.
- How hard did you push?
- I was sellin' real hard and you were looking real good.
Right up to when you actually showed up.
The fountain hurt me?
She was just looking for a different type of person.
- What type?
- I don't know.
I guess she wanted her cousin's date to be kinda cool, kinda dangerous.
And she didn't see me as cool and dangerous?
See, you have a less obvious kind of danger thing happening Come on, Eric.
On that danger scale, where would you put me?
If pushed, I'd say you're just slightly less dangerous than lime Jell-O.
- This is what everybody thinks of me?
- Oh, no, no Some people think lemon.
Some people are wrong.
'Cause I'm dangerous.
I'm outta control.
I'm I'm Cory, Mr. Buzzy had a bad dream.
Can he sleep with you where it's safe?
I'm Jell-O.
and so, Harry Truman the humble little sweater-vest wearing man from Missouri shocked everyone by bringing World War Il to a swift and decisive end.
And then, by winning reelection, even when the press had counted him out.
Ha-ha!
Cory, during class I did something I don't normally do - a lot of thinking.
And not about that big war part Il thing, but about you and me and the double date.
And this is what I came up with Oh, man, I had it a second ago.
You're sorry for not telling me you were going on the double date?
That's it!
But Shawn, it's not your fault, because you probably just figured that Eric asked me first.
That's it too.
- So you're not mad at me?
- No.
- So you're mad at Eric?
- No, I'm not mad at anybody.
Everyone did exactly what they're supposed to do.
You guys went out with cool girls from New York, and I stayed at home and played Candyland with my sister and lost.
That's who I am, Shawn, I'm a Candyland loser.
You're not a loser.
I don't want you thinking about yourself that way.
- What did you do after Candyland?
- Me and Morgan colored.
I can't see you like this.
I mean, I stayed in the lines and all.
Mom even put mine on the fridge.
Talk to him, man.
Sometimes, you know, you just have to Shawn?
- I'm all alone.
- Mr. Matthews?
How are you, my boy?
I don't I just Now, now, buck up.
Everyone gets passed over for a date now and then.
Mr. Feeny, everyone here thinks I'm safe and boring.
Well difficult as it is for me to relate to your situation, let me say that you shouldn't be constrained by how people think of you.
- George?
- Hm?
The ski club and I were talking, and we'd really love you to reconsider coming along with us on the big weekend, huh?
Look, we even found you a nice ski vest, huh?
Why, thank you, Jonathan.
But I'm rather busy right now, so could you stick it in your ear 'till I need it?
You'd be surprised how many people around here - think of me as stodgy and conservative.
- Aren't you?
There you are.
My point exactly.
You see my outer appearance and you conclude - that I'm cautious and unadventerous.
- Like lime Jell-O.
All right.
If you let people's perception of you dictate your behavior, you will never grow as a person.
But if you leave yourself open to experience, despite what others think, then you will learn and grow.
And when you grow and mature, then you can rub their smug little earring-wearing noses in it.
You know, we gotta show people we're not what they think we are.
- Yeah!
- I mean everyone thinks we're - safe and cautious.
- Yeah!
We gotta do something stupid!
Uh, yeah - Hey, baby!
- There you are.
- I missed you this morning.
- Thanks for letting me sleep in.
Well, you got in so late.
So how was the poker game?
Did you have a good time with the boys?
Same ol' same ol'.
Whoa!
Wait, whoa!
Freeze.
Oh, yes.
I see in this light what you're talking about.
With the weave and everything.
Yeah, I can see where that would take a lot of work.
- A lot of time and money.
- Oh, well, thank you honey.
So how did you come out?
Did you win or did you you know, lose?
- A little up, a little down.
- Hmm.
Gordy just called a few minutes ago - Gordy?
- Yeah.
He was curious if you and I were still on speaking terms after your $300 you know loss.
Listen, if I want to go out and spend a night with the boys and drop a buck or two or 300 uh it really shouldn't affect whether we're on speaking terms.
Are we?
Puddin'?
- You have my undivided attention.
- They called me names.
Wally called me a wuss.
Burt said I was whipped.
Gordy goes Hate it when he goes - Alan!
How could you lose $300?
- The best card I got all night was a six of clubs.
What do you want me to do?
Go ask for your money back.
You can't do that!
Oh, but I can do that?
- OK.
- What do you have to show for your $300?
I have a shirt that smells like smoke.
Yes, and what do I have to show for my $130?
- The most beautiful hair that I ever saw.
- Thank you.
That looks just like the way they got it before.
Kiss me and watch the hair.
I'm thinking about hittin' the batting cages.
You up for it?
Come on.
I'm sure the kid that laughs at you doesn't work there anymore.
Cory?
Dude?
"Dear Eric, you think I'm safe?
Well, I'm not.
"And to show you and everybody else, I'm gonna look death in the eye.
"I'm gonna laugh in the face of danger.
I'm going to the amusement park with Mr. Feeny.
" With Mr. Feeny?
"Yeah, with Mr. Feeny.
Don't try and stop me.
" In just a few moments, Adventure Park right here in Philadelphia, opens what they claim to be "the most terrifying amusement park attraction ever created.
" The Last Ride.
The park vows to open the ride as scheduled, despite vigilant protest from parents' groups, clergymen and NASA engineers.
Although adventure park owner Leonard Swindell claims the ride is safe, he is nevertheless requiring that all riders sign a catastrophe waiver, indemnifying the park against what Mr. Swindell calls "an act of God.
" Mr. Swindell, if the ride's so safe, why the waiver?
Things happen.
Who would be foolhardy enough to step inside this bullet car, for a 90-mile-an-hour spine-shattering blast straight into the heart of terror?
Hello.
Gentlemen, all I can ask is "Why"?
Because me and my buddy George are the two most fearless guys you'll ever meet.
And we laugh in the face of danger.
Ha!
Obviously your grandfather here feels the same way.
Young lady, I am not his grandfather.
I'm the thrill-seeking principal of John Adams High.
And I would like to say hello to my fellow faculty members, who I notice are not in line with me here in the heart of danger.
Right now, our brave adventurers are climbing into the car, as they sign the park waivers, which include an organ donation request.
Here you are, help yourself.
- What are you doing here?
- I got a note.
- From Cory?
- From Feeny.
Cory, get out of that car, it's not safe.
You'll kill yourself!
Mr. Feeny enjoy the ride.
- George, what are you doing?
- You surprised to see me in such a precarious position so far from the chess club, Mr. Turner?
George, riding a roller coaster is not the way to prove you're dangerous.
Would you care to join me, Mr. Turner?
Huh-huh no!
Cory, as your older brother, I am telling you to get out of this car now!
Oh, now you're so concerned for me, now you stand up for me?
Well, it's too late, I'm dead!
- You're out of your mind.
- Dangerously out of my mind.
Let's light this candle!
I understand.
You proved it to me - you're dangerous.
You don't have to do this.
Next time there's a double-date, you're going.
I'm going?
- You're going.
- Oh!
I'm going!
Warp factor ten, Mr. Zulu!
And they're off!
Straight up straight up And straight down.
There they go, through the vertical flume.
Dizzy!
- Through the spinning wall of fire.
- Hot!
Now the screaming dive of death.
And here they come, back from their harrowing journey.
Cory!
Are you OK, man?
- Aah!
- Cory!
- Aah!
- Cory, it's all right!
- Piece of cake.
- What?
I threw up a piece of cake.
George!
- George?
- Huh?
Weren't you in back when you left?
Talk to me!
At one point, I was thrown forward out of the car.
I had to run in front of the car.
George, I gotta tell ya, I'm never gonna look at you the same way again.
That took guts.
And if you want the ski club, you got the ski club.
- Don't want ski club.
- You want the chess club?
Don't want chess club.
What do you want?
- Want you to help get the kid off my back.
- Oh, OK.
Come on.
Loosen the grip, loosen the grip.
There you go.
Jeez, Cor, next time a girl wants to go out with the most dangerous guy I know it's you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Can't believe you did all of this because of me.
I did do all of this because of you, didn't I?
Mr. Feeny, you probably did all this because of Mr. Turner?
Yes, Mr. Matthews, I suppose that's so.
- Eric, would you do me a favor?
- Anything you want, oh dangerous one.
I left my shoe in there.
Would you get it for me?
- In the back?
- Yeah.
Where?
- I don't see it.
- Help him find it, for Pete's sake.
- Is it in the front there?
- It's not back here OK, light that candle!
Aah!
Who's in Wally?
Burt?
And Rodique our very special friend from the hair boutique.
Which color chips are the dollars, the magenta or the blueberry?
The blueberry.
My lucky color.
- How many do I have to put in?
- Just one.
Here she comes.
All right, gentlemen.
The bad news three tens.
Well, that is very impressive, Alan, and on many days, that would be a most winning hand.
However, today is special.
For today, Rodique has how do you say a full boat.
Read them and cry.
That's it, I'm busted.
I'm out.
Go ahead, finish the game.
Turn off the lights.
Nighty-night.
- What was that?
- I am not sure.
It came from Wally.
This game is getting totally out of hand!
Sorry I'm late, boys.
But I got the pie.
King, I'm busted.
Lend me a few bucks, will ya?
How about $150 million, will that do?
- Yeah, that might buy a haircut.
- Maybe.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Good morning, John Adams High.
After a 10-year absence, we've dusted off the console and put Patriot Radio back on the air!
- Wrong button.
- I should say so.
And with me here, my engineer and wacky side-kick on the morning zoo, Mr. Alvin Meese.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny, you're a great friend to radio.
That's enough, Alvin.
Nobody likes a mike hog.
And now, because the halls of our school beat with the lively heart of contemporary youth here is the happening sounds of Mr. Michael Bolton.
Ah!
Make it stop!
Make it stop!
It's hard to cut the wires with a plastic spoon.
Just rip the whole speaker down!
- Hey, guys.
Try this knife.
- Thanks.
Huh!
Down.
Come on, guys.
The station's only been on five minutes.
Is it really that bad?
And now, a little change of pace.
A blast from my past this is Mr. Perry Como.
Look, Mr. Turner, you clip the wires and we'll cover for you.
You don't like what you hear?
Get on the air and do better.
- Us?
On the radio?
- Yeah.
See if you can't squeeze it in between doing nothing at school, and nothing at home.
What are you saying?
We don't do anything?
- You know, we should think about that.
- I don't wanna.
No, Shawn, maybe he's got a point.
I mean, maybe if we became radio personalities, then we'd have personalities.
I don't wanna do nothing.
Look, radio is just sitting around talking.
Like we are now?
Yeah.
Maybe you have to push a button.
How hard?
Like this.
- Hm?
- Yeah.
Are you kidding me?
!
- OK, we'll do it.
- We're naturals.
- I've got a radio voice.
- And I've got a radio face.
So when can you get us on the air?
If you guys are serious about this, I'll talk to Feeny after lunch.
And now for you kiddos, Menudo.
I'll talk to him now.
Good morning.
Checking the weather it looks like a clear and sunny day for a walk to school on my first day of radio.
- You taking requests?
- Yes, I am.
Swallow your head and leave.
Obviously, Eric doesn't want Cory around while he tries to weasel money out of good old Mom and Dad.
OK, Eric, give it your best weasel.
- He needs money.
- What happened to his allowance?
He blew it on babes.
The problem here is that my allowance has not kept pace with inflation.
You have no idea what it costs to take out a pretty girl.
You wanna try that again?
Yes, I do.
What I meant to say was - Eric, you have a letter.
- Not now, Morgan, OK?
You just can't afford to take a woman Never mind, I'm rich.
- What is that?
- "Robin Leach "and National Family Publishers have selected Eric Matthews to be the winner of $10 million dollars.
" Oh, come on, you can't be that gullible.
I won!
I won!
Look!
Eric, this is just a ploy to get you to buy their magazines.
- You haven't won anything.
- No, no, no, no.
Wrong.
Look, they printed my name.
You think a big company's gonna waste all that money printing my name if I wasn't gonna win?
Good point.
Hey, you won!
Amy he won.
Maybe he can afford that brain operation we've been meaning to get him.
Go ahead and scuff if you will.
I got a good feeling about this one.
See, there's a little voice inside my head.
You know what it's saying?
"Life is like a box of chocolates"?
Huh?
Never mind, sweetheart.
You just go wait by that front door for Robin Leach.
OK, then.
Hi, I'm Cory Matthews, along with Shawn Hunter, and we're back with the most interesting show topic they would give us: Meet your student council.
Our guest today is Sara Fairburn, secretary treasurer of your student counsel.
And according to Mr. Feeny's program log, we'll be discussing the cancellation of the ninth-grade spring dance.
Now, Sara, I imagine there's quite a story here.
No.
We just ran out of money.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
So we're gonna have a bake sale and try and save our dance.
Ah!
Fascinating.
Go on.
That's about it.
Ah, come on.
What are you hiding?
Stop badgering her.
I gotta badger her, we got nothing else to talk about.
Ugh, this show stinks.
Now, Sara, you mentioned a bake sale.
What is the profit margin on a cupcake?
Heh, what are you talking about?
- Shawn, help me.
Shawn!
- Oh.
Oh, Cory, I dreamed you were doing the most painfully boring radio show in the world.
And you were there.
And you oh.
All right, now let's hear what you, the listeners, think.
Call us.
Now.
Please?
- No one's calling.
Let's go home.
- No.
Sara, a bake sale has its dark side, doesn't it?
I mean Fat.
Cholesterol.
What about that?
I don't know.
I'm just a kid.
Does she not know?
Or choose not to know?
You know, no one else wanted to do your show.
Cory.
Cory, Cory, we have a call.
Hello, you're on the air.
I'm sorry, sir.
I believe Ludwig and the German Hour follows us.
Call back later.
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, sure.
What's the point?
No, stay.
Look, we have another call.
Hello, you're on the air.
Hi, this is Spencer.
Spencer!
I believe you're a first-time caller to the show.
- You have a question for Sara?
- Yes, I do.
Sara, are you still going with Joey DeRuza?
Why do you ask, Spence?
Sorry, kids, but the topic is bake sale.
Dance salvation or death by cake.
Sara, I believe the man asked you a question.
How about an answer?
We broke up last week.
Well, I've liked you ever since last year, and, um She's smiling, Spence.
so I was thinking, uh Come on, Spence, if you don't ask this red-hot babe out, I will.
Are you doing anything this Friday?
No!
And I'd love to.
I'll meet you at the soda machine right now.
All right, we have a date!
Shawn, no one's interested in this.
We promised Turner we'd stick to the topic.
Cory, we hit on something that works.
Look at the phone lines.
They're blazing!
- People are listening to us.
- Big deal, Shawn.
A bunch of lonely guys are calling for a girl who's fixed up and gone.
I'm not gonna blow a career in radio for a bunch of lonely guys.
Are you the guys on the radio?
Yes, we are.
Could we be on the radio, too, and talk to boys?
That's why we're here!
Cory and Shawn back at you with Lunchtime Lust.
Let's meet our next contestant.
You are?
My name is Jasmine Fontana.
If it isn't, it should be.
We'll take the first three callers and hook one of you up with Jasmine Fontana.
She sure is.
Not only does Jasmine pull straight A's, but she loves to fish wearing nothing but hip waders and a bikini top.
If this sounds like the girl for you, call us, Cory and Shawn, the hottest show on ra-di-o.
You know, Jasmine, a couple of these guys have asked me if you're a good kisser and right now I don't know what to tell them.
Well, um Maybe I could help you.
Well, maybe you could.
You know, you look different up close.
- Ludwig, take over.
Schnell.
- Ja, Herr Feeny.
- Mr. Feeny, this is our show.
- Not any more.
Hello, it's Lunchtime with Ludwig.
You may call up with your requests.
I don't take them.
Out.
Come on.
See, Mr. Feeny, everyone loves what we did.
Not everybody.
Consider your radio careers over.
Oh, class, tomorrow we'll be discussing chapter 12 in your history books, which would be The Bill of Rights.
Oh, dear.
Oh, the Bill of Rights, from the good old Constitution.
And what was that amendment that came first in the Bill of Rights?
I don't recall, but I bet our teacher knows.
Well, then, why don't we ask him?
- Oh, Mr. Feeny.
- Freedom of speech.
Isn't that the one where you can say whatever you want?
I believe it is.
- And doesn't it apply to everybody?
- No.
Any kind of speech, right?
Like, in a newspaper, or TV, - or I don't know, radio?
- Yes, yes.
Then something is just not making sense here, my Shawn.
Weren't we just pulled off the air because of what we said?
Yes, we were.
He says one thing and then he does another.
He's being a hypochondriac.
What you two said over the airwaves was inappropriate.
Well, according to this here Constitution, uh-uh.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
Don't you believe in what you teach us?
Mr. Matthews, the rights of the Constitution were intended for those with a sense of responsibility.
Well, if it doesn't apply to us, then why do we have to learn it?
Hi, guys.
I have to tell you this - all the girls in fifth-period gym were talking about your show in the locker room.
Girls were talking about us in the girls' locker room?
Just tell me, were the showers on?
When are you guys gonna be on again?
Real, real soon.
We gotta get back on the air, man!
How are we gonna get back on the air?
OK, I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.
- I got it!
- What?
!
We gotta get back on the air.
- You're a genius!
- I know!
That's why we make such a good team.
- Hey, Mr. Turner.
- I don't know you.
Oh, come on, what'd we do?
You upset the guy in charge.
I mean, you know Feeny, he gave you responsibility and you guys abused it, now you're gone.
Yeah, but you're the faculty advisor.
Come on, you put us on once, you can put us on again.
Now why should I stick my neck out for you guys?
Because you're the young, dedicated teacher who believes that kids deserve a second chance.
- That's me?
- Yeah, you didn't know?
Look, the only way you guys get back on the air is if I talk to Feeny.
Yeah, like, you can talk to Feeny.
He doesn't think straight, Mr. Turner.
He doesn't even believe in the Constitution.
Yeah.
He totally ignores the first commandment.
Yeah, guys, just chill out, OK?
It can't happen without Feeny.
All right, now promise me you'll stay away from the radio station, OK?
- OK.
- OK.
Like talking to Feeny's gonna help.
He's just not gonna listen to anybody.
He's insane.
You know, it's you and me, Shawn.
Just us.
If we're gonna get back on the radio, we're gonna have to do it by ourselves.
I agree.
But we're gonna need a lot of help.
Alvin!
Tell me something Alvin, you basically put that radio station together, right?
It's my baby.
Well, Pop, let's go see how Junior's doing.
Why are we getting Aircraft Maintenance magazine?
That's mine.
Yep, yep, yep.
Eric Matthews.
Excellent.
I've been waiting for it and finally it's here.
What else we got?
Botswana Today?
Got these guys right where I want 'em.
What guys, Eric?
Robin Leach and the guys who are gonna show up at my door and hand me $10 million dollars.
Oh, this is your magazine scam.
No, no, no, no.
It's a system.
See, I ordered a magazine for every letter of the alphabet.
That way when the computer scans for a winner it can't possibly miss me.
A and B you already know.
C Chester.
The magazine for people named Chester.
I lied about my name.
Come to my store.
Spray lettuce.
Earn money.
My dream's just a little bit different than that, Dad.
'Cause you're in America, Robin Leach can still show up at your door and hand a regular guy like me a bunch of money he didn't earn.
That's a dream worth dreaming.
You know, I'm glad he changed his name.
Morning, George.
Listen, I hear the censor yanked two of my DJ's off the air.
Yes, it's a wonder the censor didn't come after their counter-culture - hippie faculty advisor.
- Hippie?
George, my Aunt Ruthie was a hippie.
Yes, and my papa was a rolling stone.
Be that as it may, your young protÃ©gÃ©s overstepped the boundaries of good taste.
Well, who decides what's good taste?
You're lookin' at him, baby.
Look, Hunter and Matthews don't get stoked about much around here, but they got into that radio show, and I think they deserve a second chance.
- With a little more adult supervision.
- Who would be the adult?
- You're lookin' at him, baby.
- Oh.
- Well, I'll take it under consideration.
- Thank you.
Oh, by the way, was your Aunt Ruthie at Woodstock?
No, I don't think so.
Must've been another Ruthie Turner.
Good morning, John Adams High!
- This is Cory.
- And Shawn.
The bad boys are back on the air!
They tried to silence us, but we're back and we're louder than ever.
Ow!
Well, Mr. Turner, your supervision seems to be working splendidly.
You're listening to Pirate Radio.
George, if you find them first, you save me a piece.
Mr. Feeny wanted us to talk about the spring dance.
We'll do him one better.
We'll give you a spring dance!
Right here, right now, Come on, everybody dance!
Now wait a minute, wait a minute!
I want everyone to stop dancing and return to your classes.
Let's start a Bill of Rights for students!
The right to dance.
Anytime, anywhere.
Help me!
Help me!
- Where are they?
- They went that way.
You help Ludwig, I'll round up the pirates.
Aye-aye, sir.
Please untie me.
I must call my father at the embassy.
You can hear us, but you can't see us.
- Where are we?
- No, keep looking.
No telling where we could be, Hey, did you check the boy's room?
Psych!
Pirate Radio is being brought to you by the Constitution of the United States of America.
Void where prohibited by Feeny.
Our next musical selection is Shawn, where's the tape?
Behind the bucket of janitor's mops.
D'oh!
Or is that a fake clue, because we couldn't possibly be that stupid.
Oh, I think you're much more stupid than you give yourselves credit for.
Don't move.
Maybe he doesn't see us.
Mr. Turner, here are your protÃ©gÃ©s.
You would assume responsibility for them, assume away.
Ludwig?
It was terrible Mr. Feeny.
I am not accustomed to being so ill-used.
Yes, well you're young yet.
- So you catch our show?
- Mm-hm.
You got any constructive criticism?
Constructive?
No.
Look, we just wanted to get back on the radio.
And you thought this was the way to go about it, as opposed to Oh, I don't know, the way we agreed on?
Oh, come one, Mr. Turner, there's no way Feeny was gonna listen to you.
Amazingly, he did listen to me.
And he was on the verge of giving you guys a second chance, then you demonstrated why you don't deserve it.
All right, then, all we were doing was exercising our right to free speech.
Oh, come on, the First Amendment does not give you the right to turn the school into a rave.
You have responsibilities.
Responsibilities to the school and to me.
- Look, Mr. Turner - No, save it.
We had a deal, boys.
Now why was it so important for you to get back on the air that you were willing to shaft me?
- You wouldn't understand.
- Pretend I'm stupid.
We went on the radio Pretend I'm smarter.
Look, Mr. Turner, we're just trying to find our place.
You know, we're only seventh graders.
But you're students, isn't that enough?
Come on, you remember what it's like?
Everybody else seems to know who they are and where they belong.
But we're nobody.
And you thought being on the radio would help you?
Yeah, I mean if we're on the radio and everyone thinks we're cool then we don't get lost in the shuffle.
You feel lost?
What about you?
Yeah, sometimes.
You know what?
I bet a lot of people feel that way.
Well, maybe they do, but I'm sure they don't wanna talk about it.
Oh, I'm sure they do.
How do you know?
Look at all the calls we have already.
We're on the air?
!
Someone must've turned on the switch accidentally.
- They heard all of that?
- Yeah.
See, guys, you don't have to do Lunchtime Lust just to get an audience.
All you have to do is be honest.
People will listen to that, too.
Hello, you're on the air.
Yes, I'm a first-time caller.
Love the show.
You have a question?
More of a comment, really.
I thought you did a commendable job handling a rather difficult situation.
Thank you, caller.
And I do have a question.
I'm curious as to what you think the appropriate punishment would be for your two guests?
I'm thinking a week's detention.
Couldn't quite hear that, seems to be some static on the line.
A month's detention.
Loud and clear.
Well, you know, that's one man's opinion.
Let's hear from some other listeners.
I say lock 'em up and throw away the key!
Get off the phone, Eric.
Guys, trust me, you got off easy.
There's a lot worse that could've happened to you.
That is them, Father.
The two American boys who tried to tie me up.
Hey, bud, Friday night.
Go, do, girls, friends.
No money, no girls, no friends.
Oh, so you're in for the evening, huh?
Well, at least you have plenty to read.
Walking Tours for the Aged.
Oh, and look how big the print is.
Oh, maybe that's some more magazines!
It's Robin Leach.
Uh-huh.
It's getting a little old, Dad.
Hi, there.
Mind if we come in?
It's very chilly out there.
Oh, my gosh, it's really Robin Leach!
Your system worked!
I never doubted you.
It was your mother.
I don't think she should get any of the money.
It's all right, Dad.
There's gonna be plenty to go around.
Hi, I'm Eric Matthews.
Hi, nice to meet you, young Eric, here in the richly appointed Matthews home.
Truly, these people have found paradise in the City of Brotherly Love.
Do you have the check?
Of course we have the check.
- Can I see it?
- Of course you can.
Yeah!
Yeah!
$10 million dollars!
Paid to the order of Dorothy Muldoon!
Whoa, whoa.
That's not you, Chester.
- It's not?
- No, of course.
It's your neighbor who lives in the cozy Tudor home next door.
But they're not there at the moment, so do you wonderful folks mind if we sort of wait here in suburban splendor until they return?
- Yeah, sure.
- Take a seat.
Have a magazine.
Have 26.
So, as we wait for our winners to return, we'll relax on the Matthews' richly upholstered sofa and gaze happily at their 30-inch console television.
Truly, this is happiness.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- What you got there, boys?
- Books for our summer trip.
Mmm Europe on a Student's Budget.
Backpacking Your Way Through Italy.
Nude Beaches on $5 a Day.
You know, where would you put the $5?
There's a new book out on Europe you may have missed.
It's called Nobody's Going to Europe if Their Grades Don't Come Up.
I read that one.
I couldn't put it down.
So, ah how's it end?
It's not clear.
The main character's parents just got a note from his teacher, Mr. Feeny, that says he's not doing so well in European History.
But Dad, that's why I'm not doing well.
Because I don't have any hands-on European experience, you know?
That's why we're going to Europe - to get our hands on something.
Eric, if I don't see a B average, you're gonna be touring the continent from behind your summer school desk.
OK, a B average.
See, that's not a problem.
So, what do I need for that - like, B's?
I'd like to see some of those.
And also some of those little letters that look like teepees.
- A's.
- Ahh - Where's Cory?
- Didn't you hear?
He's out sick.
He's real sick, he's got something bad.
- How bad?
- Hey, today's film-strip day in Sex Ed and he's not here.
Oh, dear.
All right, everybody, here's your test scores.
Oh, no Oh, no Oh Your test scores are going to be delayed for a little while, until I can track down the lady on the bus with the screaming twins, - who now has my bag.
- You took a bus?
What happened to your motorcycle?
Days couldn't start any better than this.
Some guy misjudges the width of the oh, I don't know, the whole street, and runs over my bike.
And then he decided what he really needed to do now is back up.
Oh, Mr. Turner, you love that bike.
You must be so upset.
Hey, out of respect, let's end this class right now and let the man have some time alone with his feelings.
Oh, no, no, no sit down.
Sit down.
I need to be around people.
- So you going to get it fixed?
- Oh, yeah.
On my enormous teacher's salary I can get the bike fixed.
And with the money I have left over Ha!
I can buy licorice.
Here's what I got for you - two words.
Uncle Mike's.
I'm gonna need more words.
Uncle Mike's Motorcycle Repair Shop.
- Your Uncle Mike?
- Just thought I'd mention it.
You can think about it tomorrow on the bus.
I'll just be leaving a business card.
"Lucky Leo's Bail Bonds and Prosthetics.
One way or another, we get you on your feet.
" - Sorry, wrong uncle.
- Mm-hmm.
Thursday's examination will include everything up to the French Revolution.
Uh, excuse me.
Will we have to know who won?
Yes, you will need to know who won and by how much.
Eric, I don't think this is gonna work.
Come on, this is a great idea.
We just gotta catch him in a good mood, you know?
This isn't an F, it's an F plus.
Your work is deplorable, your penmanship illegible.
But after all, your mother is my sister, so there we are.
I'll see you at Thanksgiving.
Come on, lets go.
Excuse me, Mr. Feeny, could we just talk to you for a second?
If you must.
Jason and I were thinking, we're both C plus students - I'm aware.
- We seem to be stuck on that C plus - and we just can't get off it.
- The word is "mired.
" Uh-huh.
All right, what about on the next test or two, if you give us, say, B's?
- You know what's gonna happen?
- Tell me.
For the first time, we're gonna know how exciting it is to get a B. We'd be hooked!
We would do anything we could to get another one of those B's.
We would be inspired to study and learn from that day forward.
Aha.
Then why don't we give elephants pants?
Perhaps then they'd be inspired to buy coats.
- Let's go.
- Gentlemen I have a radical idea of my own.
Let's say for the next test or two, - you both study very, very hard.
- It's OK.
And your better grades will then be deserved.
But see, Mr. Feeny, if we don't get a B, we can't go to Europe.
Are you serious about raising your grades?
- Yeah.
- Because if you are, I might recommend a senior teaching assistant.
You mean like a tutor?
Aha.
Why did you say yes?
!
- 'Cause I want to go to Europe!
- A tutor?
You know what that is?
It's a four-eyed, greasy-haired, zit-faced, - life support system for a book.
- Hi, I'm Tory Hart.
If I knew anything, would I need a tutor?
OK, Cory, I brought you the homework.
Earth science, algebra, English, shop.
You're supposed to make something.
I'm done.
It's a shelf.
So how soon are you going to be back in school?
Well, with mono, you never know exactly.
You have mono, as in the kissing disease?
I believe that's the one.
Cory Matthews, who have you kissed?
I-I-I feel so light-headed.
- Topanga, is that you?
- Cut that out!
Must sleep.
Don't know for how long.
- Auntie Em Auntie Em - This is not over.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
That was fun.
Tonight, I want you to read this.
And I want a cogent discussion from you on the excesses of the monarchy that led to the revolution.
You know, there's no reason why this relationship has to be purely business.
- Is that out of your system now?
- Yes, Mistress Tory.
How did it go?
Brr - Hello.
- Hello.
All right, look, gonna be real up-front here.
This is not my best subject.
My attitude about history has always been, it's done, it's over, let's move on.
I've looked at some of your essays and I must say, you have an interesting style.
- Thank you.
- When you're writing about history, you never seemed to be too concerned with names, dates - and what actually happened.
- It's done, it's over, let's move on.
It's just beginning.
It's far from over.
So let's move on to some place more comfortable.
OK.
Hi there.
- Uh I'm looking for uncle Mike.
- Why?
- I kind of want to get my bike fixed.
- Why'd you come here?
- The sign says you fix bikes.
- You wearin' a wire?
- No.
- Mind if I pat you down?
Not without dinner first.
Hey, Mr. Turner.
You two guys met already?
Yeah, we're making dinner plans.
Look, this guy's my teacher.
You take good care of him, OK?
- Like family.
- No!
OK.
So, professor, let's see the patient.
Right out here.
Oofa!
What do you think it'll cost?
Mmm haa - I'm thinking - Uncle Mike In the neighborhood of $300.
Ahh I could live in that neighborhood.
Listen, I mean, you understand it doesn't mean I give the kid a break on grades or anything.
Like he needs it.
Shawnie's the scholar of the family.
I think you're telling me the truth.
- OK, here's your first question.
- Mm-hmm.
There's this girl and she's on a date with a guy she thinks is pretty cute.
- Now, is this hypothetical?
- No, it's just hi.
Hi.
So she knows she likes the guy because he's adorable and obviously real nice.
So how does she make it more of a personal relationship without compromising the business side?
This is about me, isn't it?
- See, you're very smart.
- Look, Tory, if we get involved with each other, it's gonna cut into our work time.
If I'm ever gonna get to Europe, I have to do well on this test.
Well, let's see I like you.
I happen to have the answers to the test.
And even though I like history, right now I'm thinking more about current affairs.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, I have your ticket to Europe right here.
- It was brutal.
- Yeah, at least it was multiple choice.
Oh, come on, it was a Feeny test.
Each question gives you 11 choices.
What did you pick for that Crusades question?
- R. - R?
Shoot, I went with V. It's not like it really matters.
I left half the test blank.
- Ooh that could hurt you.
- Yeah.
Should have just taken the answers when Tory offered them to me.
Gee, that was the end of a very good story.
Perhaps you'd like to tell me the rest.
I didn't take the answers because it would have been cheating.
Yeah She wanted something from me in exchange.
What?
Me.
- Ohh - Yeah.
- Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid - Ouch.
Gentlemen.
Out of some morbid curiosity, I was anxious to see how you did on your test.
Mr. Marsden, you received a B. A B!
A B!
I got a B!
Yes, Mr. Marsden.
And now that you've achieved it, I don't expect anything less.
You know, you take the joy out of everything.
Thanks.
Mr. Matthews, you earned an A minus.
I think you owe something of a debt of gratitude to Miss Hart.
Yeah I owe her somethin'.
Hey, Tory!
How do you get an A minus when you leave half the test blank?
That was very helpful.
I didn't have to do much erasing.
I told you I didn't want to do it this way.
Which way?
This way?
I wanted to earn the grade myself.
To prove to myself I was smart.
Why, you've got so much else going for you?
You're charming, you're funny.
You've got these kissable little dimples.
Hey, hey, hey!
You don't think I can earn a good grade by myself, do you?
I think you can do whatever you set your cute little mind to.
I'm just like some object to you, huh?
What you think I'm a bimbo?
I am not a bimbo.
Hey, how come you guys get a couch?
I can't believe it.
It's like new.
I mean, it's like better than new.
Are you sure this is my bike?
Check the serial number.
It's filed off.
I did that for you.
Whoa, wait, there seems to be a decimal problem with this bill here.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying $1,500?
That's nutty!
Maybe you'd like to take it up with our complaint department?
Yeah, I would.
What?
!
Hey!
Mr. Turner, didn't I tell you my Uncle Mike would do you right?
Yeah, he's doing me right now.
Uncle Mike, I can't take my eyes off you for one second?
That is a legitimate bill.
Labor 1600 hours.
Boy, it sure seemed like it.
Uncle Mike, this guy's my teacher.
You hurt him, I hurt you.
Is that a threat?
Yeah, it is.
My brother's son.
OK, professor, $300.
Suddenly I'm a man of my word.
Just wish your mother was alive to see this.
She is.
Oh, I should give her a call.
Midnight, my son is studying?
He's actually sitting at a table reading a book.
- Where's the girl?
- Yeah, there are no girls.
There never any girls.
You know, there are no babes in all of history.
You know what they do when they finally find one?
They burn her at the stake.
Dopes.
Proud of you.
I gotta go.
I got a girl.
Hi, Eric.
How'd you know it was me?
A guy who wants to go to Europe, night before the test Lucky guess.
So, what's up?
I'm sitting here studying and there's just way more material than I thought I was hoping maybe you could help me focus on the areas I'm gonna need to know for the test?
- OK.
- All right.
One, D. Two, L. Three is X Uh, no.
Look, I don't want the answers, I just want you to help me study.
Eric, I've seen this test.
It's real tough.
You don't think I'm gonna do well?
I think you're gonna need a little help.
What if I study all night?
Eric, if you want to go to Europe, I really don't see any other way.
Just write them down.
You don't have to decide now.
OK?
One is D. Two, L. Three, X. Four, M. There he is, Mr. Europe.
How come you didn't tell us you were doing much better?
I didn't do much.
Mr. Feeny said your average came up a full grade.
Yeah, I guess it did.
So we thought a young man going to Europe could use one of these.
- Ooh - I know we were tough on you, sweetheart, but we knew that if you tried, you could do it.
- You showed us what you're made of, kid.
- Yeah what I'm made of.
This is really nice, but I don't deserve this.
I mean, I really don't deserve this.
What are you talking about?
You worked your butt off.
- You should feel good about yourself.
- I do.
I do.
I feel good about myself and my schoolwork.
I feel so good about myself and my schoolwork, I'm actually going to go back there now.
Excuse me.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
Something I can do for you, Mr. Matthews?
Uh yeah.
Uh Actually wanted to talk to you about summer school.
What about it?
Uh You know the tests I've been taking where suddenly it looked like I was doing so much better and it was too good to be true?
Was it?
OK.
OK, I feel better.
Thanks.
Chair.
I cheated, Mr. Feeny.
I had the answers to the test written on my hand.
And you only managed an A minus?
I sneezed off a couple of the answers.
All right, who gave you the answers?
Oh, why would you have to know that?
Because two people are involved in this, and if I punish two instead of one, I get a bonus at the end of the week.
A guy in your class last year.
He sold me the answers.
Why did you do this, Mr. Matthews?
I don't know.
I really wanted to go to Europe this summer and I guess I saw my whole trip slipping away.
That's superficial, Mr. Matthews.
Perhaps it's something a little deeper?
There is no deeper with me, Mr. Feeny.
I'm not a good student!
I'm just an average guy who can get by on a nice smile.
I'm never gonna get an A, never gonna make the honor roll.
That's who I am.
Might as well just accept it.
I have.
The only thing that limits you, Mr. Matthews, is your laziness.
You're just looking for an excuse to never get the grades - that I know you're capable of getting.
- I'm not capable.
- And they're just grades.
- Just grades?
Oh, well It's just Europe.
And they're just girls.
And it's just a beach.
Unless you happen to know, that on that beach, in June of 1944, and began the liberation of Europe, so that 50 years later, those girls could run around on that beach in freedom.
I put L. - Am I interrupting?
- Ah, Miss Hart, please come in.
- In a way, this involves you.
- It does?
Yes.
Mr. Matthews just dropped by to confess - that he has been cheating on his tests.
- He has?
Yes.
And since you've been tutoring him, I assumed Did he say I gave him the answers?
As a matter of fact, Mr. Matthews claimed that I can't believe you, Eric.
I just tried to help you.
How could you do this to me?
I didn't.
I think the question, Miss Hart, is how could you do this to him?
I didn't think he could pass the test.
Oh, why not?
You see no potential in him as a student?
I just don't think he's the student type.
I see.
And are you the teacher type?
- Or the type that just writes people off?
- It doesn't mean that I didn't like you.
Well, you certainly don't respect him.
Well, this is what I get for selecting a pretty girl to be a teaching assistant.
Excuse me?
Oh, you resent that, hm?
Because growing up with a pretty face, you had to work twice as hard to be taken seriously?
I should think you, more than most, would want to help this young man have his chance at being taken seriously.
Are you firing me, Mr. Feeny?
Did you learn something today, Miss Hart?
Yes, sir, I did.
Well, then, you can go.
So, how come you didn't fire her?
I don't write people off, Mr. Matthews.
You're a good teacher, Mr. Feeny.
Yes, and you're smarter than you look.
I look forward to working with you in summer school.
Yeah, it'll be a good summer.
Uh-huh.
It's over, Cory.
Case is closed.
- What?
- The great Cory Matthews mono mystery.
- So you found out who the lucky girl was?
- Oh, yeah.
And the very lucky girl was a guy named Steve Nelson.
- What?
- He sneezed on you.
Two weeks ago in Chemistry.
He's the only other person in school who just had mono.
Yes, that's right.
I remember now.
Steve Nelson sneezed on me right about the time when I was making out with Jennifer Connors.
- You were not.
- Long, messy kisses.
Hours days I could describe her tonsils.
- You're a pig.
- You only say that 'cause you like me.
- You think so, huh?
- Yeah, I do.
- And you like me?
- Only if you tell me if you like me.
Why should I tell you that?
Because if you tell me how you feel about me, then I'll tell you how I feel about you.
OK.
OK, I like you.
You know I like you.
Now, you like me or what?
OK, the way I feel about you Come closer.
The way I feel about you is Is Cory?
Cory!
I hate you!
Well, I think I handled that pretty well.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Yes.
- Say it again.
Yes, I'd love to go out with you.
Now say it with my name.
Yes, Shawn, I'd love to go out with you Shawn.
- Well, who's Shawn?
- You are.
I know.
Jill Hollinger wow!
This is a whole new type of girl for you.
I know!
She's got style, she's got elegance, she's got parents.
Look!
Baby geeks discovering the female of the species.
I say we tag them and return next spring.
Why don't you return never!
They attempt to protect themselves by puffing up.
- I don't see you guys with any girls.
- Oh, please We only hunt when we need to hunt.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha wabbit season.
Uh, hi.
You probably don't know me- - You're Eric Matthews.
- Great guess.
- I'm Valerie Stevens.
- Two in a row!
- Guess what I'm gonna ask you next?
- You gonna ask me out?
- And guess what you're gonna say?
- I'd love to, but I can't.
You see I skate and I spend all my free time at the rink.
Oh, all your free time?
You know, it's amazing you two haven't seen each other there already.
- Huh?
- Eric skates.
And since you skate, he skates, you both skate, you could meet each other there.
Right, Blades?
Yeah!
I'm always there real early in the morning.
You know, right when they're rolling out the ice.
You're so funny.
So, let's get together and skate sometime?
- How's Friday?
- How's Friday?
- Nod your head yes.
- Yes.
This is great!
A guy I like who skates.
What are the odds?
I'd say pretty slim.
Jason, I don't skate at all.
Hey, come on.
Canadians skate.
How hard could it be?
Topanga, you wrote your biography on who?
Someone I really admire - Katie Couric.
Oh, please I'm so perky, I have such a big smile.
She's a phony.
At least pick someone real.
OK, Cory, who are you picking?
Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise.
Come on, Matthews.
Real people.
The assignment is biography, not fiction.
- Captain Kirk - La-la - Captain Kirk is a made-up TV character.
- la-la-la-la - It's the truth.
- No, it's not!
Matthews, come on.
The guy's 63 years old.
He wears a tribble on his head.
It doesn't have to be somebody famous.
Just somebody real.
Anybody you like.
- Anybody?
- Anybody.
- Absolutely anybody?
- Absolutely anybody.
- I pick Shawn.
- I pick Cory.
- You know you walked right into that.
- I did, didn't I?
All right, Shawn Hunter Now, where are you from?
- I'm from here.
- Uh-huh.
Shawn was raised by wolves.
Jill, it's too bad Friday's all the way at the end of the week, huh?
Yeah Look, Shawn, about Friday I can't go out with you.
I'm free Saturday too.
I can't Saturday or any day.
- Why not?
- I just can't, OK?
- What was that about?
- I don't know.
She just totally blew me off.
Yeah, but yesterday she couldn't wait to go out with you.
Doesn't make sense.
Something's wrong.
Look, just wait here.
Mindy Listen, what's with Jill?
Why'd she dump Shawn?
Come on, Cory, I think it's pretty obvious.
Like her parents would ever let her go out with him.
- They have a problem with Shawn?
- Only a lot.
Shawn and Jill don't exactly belong to the same you know, circle.
- What do you mean "circle"?
- Hello!
His family, where they live, what they do.
I mean, yuck!
- May I go, please?
- Yeah, go.
Hey, come on.
What does she know, right?
- I shouldn't have asked her out.
- You bet.
I mean, if she's a snob like that What was I thinking?
Like I had a shot at a girl like that.
She doesn't know what she's talking about.
Yeah?
Look at where I live.
- You live in a great place.
- Cory, I live in a trailer park.
But what a trailer park.
I mean, it's got all sorts of things.
Like a pool - you know, when it rains.
Jason, you're the one that told Valerie I could skate, - so you've gotta help me out with this.
- Relax, I'll come up with something.
- Don't I always?
- No!
Then I'm due.
Now a lot of this is just presentation.
You gotta look comfortable, but you still gotta be able to flex.
I am not wearing spandex.
No way.
You think we should find out about that?
As long as Eric's saying "no way," I guess we're all right.
Here's a good picture for your biography.
Ah, look, you're playing in your sandbox at the old house.
- You always had a house, didn't you?
- Yeah, but it was tiny and I spent most of my time playing in the sandbox.
Yeah, I spent most of my time playing in the burnt-out old Chevy out back by the septic tanks.
- Cool.
- You staying for dinner, Shawn?
No, not tonight.
Why don't you come over to my place?
- My dad's broiling fish.
- On the engine of his pick up?
- I thought you liked it last time?
- Well, I did, it was just a little oily and anti-freezy.
Fine.
OK, I understand.
Stay in your nice kitchen, - eat your fancy oven-cooked food.
- We haven't worked on your biography.
Hey, I lived, I died.
No big deal.
- Cory!
Cor!
- There you are.
- You OK?
- I'm great!
Good.
I was worried when you missed first period.
- I had a conflict.
- What were you doing?
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
- Not that way.
The lower hallway's flooded.
- But we have to get to the library.
Right now, Miss Barnett, the library is only accessible by canoe.
- What happened?
- We're sinking!
Janitor Bud, get your big mop!
- You?
- I also freed the rats in the biology lab.
Get this - I turned all the clocks ahead 12 hours.
Yeah, sure.
Naturally I'm impressed and all, but what do you think you're doing?
Just giving you good stuff for your bio.
"A mild-mannered youth until seventh grade, Shawn realized he was nothing but trailer trash, so he blew up the entire school.
" - Look, is this about that girl Jill?
- No, this is about me being who I am.
Jill did me a favor.
She showed me where I stand with all the Jills of the world.
- Hey!
- Hey yourself.
I guess you heard about all the stuff I've been doing around the school, huh?
Why?
What did you do, color outside the lines?
That's a good one.
"Color outside the lines.
" Listen, squeak, we ain't impressed with your piddly little monkeyshines.
Yeah, when you got something they can wrap a grand jury around, then give us a jingle.
Hey, it's my first day.
I'll do bigger stuff.
What's the source of all these new aspirations?
- I thought maybe I could hang with you.
- Ha!
Like it's so easy, right?
- We simply make it look effortless.
- Come on now, now, gentlemen.
We always need to be on the lookout for new promising talent.
- So am I in?
- No.
You see, the membership committee just not impressed enough to make you a full-fledged thug.
We do, however, offer a nice internship program.
That's how I started.
And today, I'm a thug.
So you wanna come sit in the parking lot with us?
- And do what?
- What, ain't I just said?
Sit.
Hey, you got yourself a sitter.
Hey, Shawn, why do you want to hang out with these guys?
- What's wrong with that?
- Listen, whatever your problem is, - these aren't the guys to help you.
- So you think I have a problem?
Class starting, door shutting.
Matthews, Hunter, this means get in.
I think you're gonna have a problem if you hang out with guys like that.
They happen to be my kind of guys, OK?
- We're part of the same circle.
- Look, Shawn- - Cory let go.
- Hey!
- Where's your friend going?
- I wish I knew.
- Hey, Mr. Feeny.
- Yeah All right, listen.
I was just wondering, could I ask you a few questions?
- For your biography assignment?
- Yeah, that's the one.
I'm flattered, Mr. Matthews.
Let's see A lot of people think I was born in Boston.
But in point of fact- Mr. Feeny I'm not writing about you.
- Oh.
- I'm writing about Shawn.
Of course.
Of the truly great lives lived, I suppose Shawn Hunter would be the obvious choice.
Falling somewhere between Gandhi and Soupy Sales.
Yeah.
I was just wondering, do people turn out a certain way because of where they come from?
You know, where they live, who their parents are?
Ah, the old nature versus nurture conundrum.
Yeah, to use a lot of words I don't understand.
Personally, I believe that a man, no matter where he comes from, chooses his own path.
So really, no matter who you are, you can make up your own mind - about what you want to do?
- Absolutely.
- Cory, dinner!
- I'll come in when I choose to.
Get your butt in here now!
- Uh, Mr. Feeny - My theory bites?
I'm thinkin'.
- What's this?
- You hold in your hand a subliminal Learn To Skate In Your Sleep tape.
But I don't wanna skate in my sleep.
- Ha-ho you're lucky you got that smile.
- Thank you.
I dubbed over my mom's weight-loss tape, but it should still work.
- I mean, it worked for her.
- No, it didn't.
She's huge.
Yeah, and in only eight weeks.
Jason, this is a stupid idea.
It's never gonna work.
I'm just gonna tell her that I can't skate.
And if I lose the date, so what?
I don't know what it is, but the skating skirts keep getting shorter and shorter.
Pretty soon, I'm not gonna be wearing anything.
Oh, Eric, see you Friday on the ice.
I play it while I sleep?
No, no, no, no more detached.
You still look friendly.
Uh, slouch a little bit.
A little bit!
More lip.
Ahh Frankie, you do it.
- I can't work with this kid.
- It's my first day.
Yeah, Joey, you remember your first day You wore a suit.
Guys, um Once I get the look down, then what?
Oh, listen to the eager beaver.
OK, eager, this morning, you get the bagels.
- Bagels?
- Bagels.
- That's it?
- That's it.
Shawn!
I've been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?
- Nowhere, man.
- Come on, Shawn.
Listen, I've been thinking.
It's time we both faced the facts.
- The facts?
- Cory, you and I are different.
Sooner or later, we're gonna end up in different places.
- Says who?
- Why don't we just do us both a favor right now and call it quits, OK?
- What has gotten into you?
- You just don't get it, do you?
- Get what?
!
- Look at your house, Cor.
Look at where you live.
Look at how I live.
Look at your parents.
Look at my parents.
I know where I'm gonna end up.
Just let me get there now.
- Shawn!
- Just let me get there now!
- Hey Keiner, you got a minute?
- Nah, sorry, fresh out.
Find one.
Oh, shh There's one now.
I noticed Shawn Hunter's been hangin' out with you and your boys.
Oh, sorry, Mr. Turner, we're full up.
But we'll be happy to put you on the waiting list though.
Cut the kid a break, will ya?
Yeah, I think I did by letting him hang out with me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- What a guy you are.
- Well, you know But somehow I don't think that's what the kid needs right now.
Oh, am I getting a speech?
You get more than that if Hunter's not back in my class.
What's the matter?
You stood there and took that from a teacher?
- How come you didn't say nothin'?
- Because actions speak louder than words, gentlemen.
I just came up with the perfect initiation for Hunter.
There are no barriers to your success when you are in control.
- You can - ice skate That's right.
You can absolutely, positively - ice skate - Food has no power over you.
Sure you've tried other diets, but now you'll finally skate real good.
- Now picture a beautiful thin - ice skater reaching out to you, encouraging you.
- Showing you how to - ice skate.
What the heck's going on?
- Wait a minute.
You're you're the - I'm your inner skater.
- I'm here to help you.
- But how?
- You like Valerie, don't you?
- Well yeah.
Then I'll teach you how to skate right into her heart.
Come on.
The last time I skated, I was at a third grade birthday party.
I fell flat on my face and split my lips.
Couldn't even eat the cake.
Don't put up barriers to your success.
If you believe in yourself, you can ice skate.
- But no.
'Cause - Hush.
Take my hand.
- Where is this place?
- You're in a rink.
- But I don't know how to skate.
- Yes, you do.
- Do what I did.
- OK.
Nance, watch this!
Triple-lutz double-axle Salchow.
I'll see you at the '98 games in Nagano.
- In your dreams.
- I'll never want this to end.
But it must.
This is the end of side one.
Please turn the tape over.
Huh?
Please turn over the tape.
This is the end of side one.
I can skate.
I can skate now!
And food has no power over me.
Maybe it's none of my business, but you're putting orange juice on your cereal.
Huh?
All right.
What's going on?
Nothing It's just that Shawn, he doesn't want to be my friend anymore.
- Since when?
- Since yesterday.
- You guys have a fight or something?
- No.
That would actually make some sense.
Shawn's got it into his head that we're going to grow up and not be friends.
So he just wants to start not being friends right now.
Why does he think you're gonna stop being friends?
I don't know.
It's stupid stuff like where he lives, what snobby girls think.
And now he's mad at me for no reason at all.
My guess, Cory, is he's really not mad at you.
- Then why is he acting like this?
- I don't know for sure, but sometimes people can push you away just when they need you the most.
- Then he must really need me.
- Maybe he does.
Turner's bike.
Clearly he takes very good care of it.
Not a scratch on it and look how it shines.
- You could eat it.
- You mean eat off it?
I said what I said.
It's a real thing of beauty.
Shame what's about to happen to it.
- What's about to happen to it?
- You are, my friend.
Mmy advice on the first swing - don't go for a home run, - just make some contact, huh?
- May I recommend the headlight.
Good noise, broken glass - a real crowd pleaser.
Swing batter, swing batter, swing batter, swing batter, swing batter.
Can I take a couple of practice swings first?
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What are ya thinking, Frankie?
- I'm thinking he ain't got the guts.
- Yeah, I'm smelling chicken.
A big one, extra crispy.
I say we take him to the colonel.
He'll pluck ya, fry ya, and serve you in a bucket with biscuits.
Ooh I just remembered something.
OK, Hunter.
This is where we find out if you're really with us.
Go ahead.
- Hey guys, what's up?
- Cory, come on, get out of here.
Shawn, that looks like a bat.
- Could that be Turner's bike?
- Yeah, you're right!
- Now would you leave?
- Nah, this kind of looks like fun.
- Here, let me go first.
- Cory, let go.
- No, I'm gonna try it.
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- Yeah?
Neither are you.
- Would you just let me do this?
If you're gonna do this, Shawn, then I'm gonna do it.
- This is not your place, OK?
- Are you saying I don't belong here?
- That's what I'm saying.
- If you belong here, then I belong here.
Hey, baboon, look, we got some business here.
So I suggest that you walk away - while your legs still bend only once.
- Listen, Keiner, this is between me and Shawn.
So take your greasy head and your rat-faced thug and get away from my friend.
Oh, my Oh, my, my, my All right, Harley, you've got one punch, but you better make it good, 'cause chances are, it's gonna kill me.
Think so.
Hey, fellas.
Hey, whew Boy, thanks for lookin' out for my bike.
From my window up there, it looked like some clowns were about to mess it up.
Yeah, well, I'm just glad that we got here in time, you know?
Come on, Joey, we've got some appointments.
Hey, when he said "rat-face," was that, like, pejorative?
All right, you two.
You wanna tell me what the problem is here?
- No problem.
- Everything's great.
Who you kiddin'?
What's with you, Hunter?
Why you wanna hang out with these lowlifes?
- Maybe I'm a lowlife too, OK?
- Is that what you think?
- That's what everybody else thinks.
- I wanna know what you think.
- Hey!
I'm out here with a bat, aren't I?
- Yeah!
- But you didn't swing it.
- Just 'cause Cory came along.
Oh, you think that was an accident?
Huh?
That you have a friend who thinks so much of you, he's willing to put his own neck on the line?
No, I don't think lowlifes have friends like that.
Do you?
- I don't know.
- They don't!
I don't know anything.
I don't even know who I am!
Well, Shawn, I know who you are.
You're Shawn Hunter!
You were raised by wolves.
You're my friend!
It says so in your biography.
I mean, what else do you need to know?
I need to know what's gonna happen to me and you can't tell me that.
Hey, Hunter All Matthews can do is be your friend.
And so far, he's been doing a real good job.
All I can do is teach you whatever I can, and hope that you'll leave my class a little better than when you came in.
You mean, drag the trailer-park trash up to decent society?
Hey, if you don't know that deep down inside you're all right, then I haven't taught you anything at all.
- You think I'm all right?
- I think you need to think you're all right.
You think I'm all right?
I think if you put your mind to it and get back inside that school, and never never go near this Harley, or that Harley Yeah I think you'll be all right.
Mr. Turner, do you really think he's gonna be OK?
Sure.
I can't believe what a good skater you are.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Didn't think you'd believe me.
You want to go to Chubbies and grab a bite?
Whoo-hoo!
A little food has no power over me.
- Eric, you OK?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
I had a really big lunch.
You mind keeping me company while I eat?
- You can have some desert.
- Ha-ha desert is the enemy of my hips.
If you don't want to go out with me, just say so.
No!
I can do this.
Come on, let's go to Chubbies and get some foo Fuah - Some fuad - Hey!
Buddy, you were great out there.
- Want a hot-dog?
- Aah!
- All beef.
- Ahh!
- Chili cheese!
- Ahh!
- Dinner?
- Love to.
All right.
You know, uh I taught Eric how to skate.
- Did you?
- Uh-huh.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Steve Young takes the snap.
- Jerry Rice goes long.
He throws a perfect 60-yard pass and hits - A blue 1995 Buick Regal.
- Run!
- They're not moving.
- Maybe they lapped us.
Uh, Frankie, Joey, I realize it's none of my business why you're not beating us up, but why aren't you beating us up?
Maybe they don't understand.
I'll translate.
Why ain't you pounding us to a pulp?
Here here, let me try.
Hey!
Why no this?
Sorry, the thrill is gone.
Too bad.
What you got there?
- It's a letter from Harley Keiner.
- It's OK, Joey.
How's Harley doing in his new reform school?
It's called juvenile boot camp.
He loves it, thank you very much.
He never wants to come home.
He doesn't say it here, but I think he's got a new gang.
- Are you OK?
- You don't get it.
We're lackeys We're hangers-on with nothing to hang on to.
Come on, Joey, we might as well go to class.
It's come to this.
OK, we're back live.
Second half.
- Steve Young back to pass.
- Jerry Rice is open.
He throws!
- Intercepted.
- By Feeny.
The wily veteran.
- I stink.
- I agree.
Have you seen your latest test score?
If Mr. Matthews stinks, you, Mr. Hunter, are as odoriferous as a dead man in July.
A 12.
How do you get a 12?
I don't know.
You ever open a book?
What?
A book!
Do you ever open a book?
What?
!
Don't ask me, I got a 16.
Gentlemen, do you ever go home and open a book?
What?
I want you to go home this afternoon and open a book!
I don't care what you had otherwise planned, I order you Nay, I command you.
Go home and open a book!
- George?
- What?
!
Watch this.
Hi, boys nice boys.
Nice boys.
Fellas, did you hear anything Mr. Feeny just said?
- No.
- He's real mad.
- Do you have any idea why?
- No, - he just started yelling like a crazy man.
- Huh.
You know, I'd give up on them, but I don't think they'd notice.
What?
Guys, I hate to add to your troubles, but your book reports were due on my desk by the end of the class.
Hey, he took our ball, man.
Hey, wait, I didn't hear anything about any book reports.
I only mentioned it every day in class for the last two weeks.
Look, Mr. Turner, just give us 'till Wednesday?
I swear we'll have them in.
- Tuesday?
- I'm grading them Sunday.
So Tuesday?
Please, Mr. Turner, help me bring up my grades.
- I just got a 16.
- And I got a 12.
- Between us it makes 24.
- 28.
Thanks.
OK, I'll throw you one.
Have your papers in my hand, at my place, Sunday, 5:00, not a minute later.
All right, Mr. Turner, I should tell you My dog ate it.
Not yet.
How's your homework coming, honey?
- Great.
I'm acing it.
- Making sandwiches is homework?
Making their own lunches teaches them to be self-reliant and grown-up.
I'm making Wonder Bread, Cheeze Whiz and Lucky Charms.
Ugh.
Honey, let me give you a couple of pointers here- - She needs to make her own mistakes.
- She's well on her way.
I mean, look at this, this is disgusting.
Nobody's gonna want to eat this.
Hey, that's not bad.
What the heck have you discovered here?
- What you eating, Dad?
- Lucky Charms and Cheeze Whiz.
- You want some?
- It's Morgan's, right?
- Uh-huh.
- You tried Froot Loops on pita?
Tomorrow.
They ran a promotion at the store, and guess what you won?
Two passes to Sliding Rapids Mountain.
Excellent!
Yep, you and your brother should have a blast.
Ah, no, no, no, no See, when I look at this ticket, I see someone in a skimpy wet bikini.
Well, that's entirely up to Cory.
You know what I can't figure out, Shawn?
How do these other kids get their work in on time and get such good grades?
Well, I got a theory, Cor.
See, it runs in the family.
Our ancestors were all slackers and goof-offs and now we're paying the price.
That's a good theory.
All right, if I make this one, we start.
Open a book!
What?
!
I wish there was some way to do a book report without reading the book.
They can put a man on the moon, but you still gotta read.
I got it!
We rent the movie and copy the junk on the back of the box.
- You're a genius!
- What, you think that 16 was an accident?
Shawn, watch this.
Hey, guys!
Look, look milk money.
See it?
Smell it!
Feel it.
Can't you just imagine how good you'd feel just ripping this from my hands and stuffing me in the garbage can?
Wow!
Cort, stick your whole head in Frankie's mouth.
Come on, guys.
What have we ever done to you?
Ohh Look at us, we're pathetic.
We just gotta face the facts - Harley's gone and he ain't coming back.
Never never never.
- We need a new leader.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
The times they're a-changin', Frankie.
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
- I can't believe it's not butter.
- You make a lot of sense.
A new leader, but who?
Yo, Jasmine!
Did you know that our bodies are 98% water?
If you can squeeze that other 2% into a bikini, I've got two tickets to our natural habitat.
That's great.
Where's your ticket?
- I'm just about to pick it up.
- I can't wait.
All right.
- You thinking?
- I'm thinking.
Eric, can you take me to the video store after school?
I gotta return my you know books.
You mean the tapes you used for your reports?
That's them.
You know, it would be a shame if Mom and Dad found out about that.
- I'll say.
- So will I unless I get your water park ticket.
- You enjoy this, don't you?
- Does it show?
- Did you see that, Frankie?
- I'm getting all tingly.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
- Mr. Turner, we're here.
- Oh, great.
- 4:58.
We made it.
- Sprinted six blocks, - ran up four flights of stairs - But we made it.
I admire your dedication.
Especially since the deadline is 5:00 tomorrow.
- OK, we'll wait, then.
- Give me.
Of Mice And Men- a poignant tale of two unlikely friends, set against the backdrop of the Great Depression.
Exceptional cast, powerfully acted.
Two thumbs up.
I've got a date.
I've gotta finish getting dressed, so have a seat, catch your breath, grab a soda from the fridge if you want.
Wow!
I can't believe we're in Mr. Turner's place.
His private domain.
Inside a teacher's home.
What's the big deal, Cory?
You've lived next to Feeny your whole life.
Yeah, but he's never let me inside his house.
At Halloween he always drops the candy off at my door.
- Shawn, what are you doing?
- I'm checking out his CD's.
- Put that down.
He'll know.
- It's a CD.
How's he gonna know?
- Pick it up!
Pick it up!
- Those might be piranhas.
Use your left hand.
Good idea.
Nice fish.
Nice fish.
Yeah, go over there.
Oh, but you can play with the truck.
He'll never notice.
Hey, look, Miss Tompkins' phone number.
- Who?
- You know, that social studies teacher.
Oh, right, the blonde.
That must be who he's going out with.
Yeah, they'll probably go out to dinner and then see a movie and then Oh, man - There's ice in the freezer!
- Ah ah we're fine.
We're OK.
Hey, Cory, check it out.
It's next week's lesson plans.
- We can't look at that.
- Yeah, well, I already saw.
Then let me see.
Tuesday, pop quiz.
Chaps eight, ten to sixteen.
Darn, it's in code.
Wow!
I can't believe this.
This is top-secret information.
Exactly when the pop quiz is and what's on it.
This is very valuable.
- Hey guys!
- Put it back!
Put it back!
What do you think?
This shirt or the one I'm wearing?
- The one you're wearing is good.
- Definitely the one you're wearing.
Anyway, Mr. Turner, we have to go.
- No drinks?
- No drinks.
We'll take a rain check, OK?
Yeah, my book is due back and I've gotta rewind it.
See you in class, Mr. Turner.
We have no right to know what we just found out.
- We know when there's a test.
- We know what to study.
- We just might get good grades.
- We finally beat the system!
Yeah!
- What?
!
- You spooked him.
- I told you not to spook him.
- If we're gonna hang with somebody, - he should know we're here.
- Harley didn't know for months.
Ah, guys, what are you doin'?
- You tell us, we're here to serve.
- We're your new lackeys.
- "Lackeys," what do you mean?
- We do stuff you want.
We're like magic genies, but on a smaller scale.
I really appreciate that, guys, but no thanks.
- Uh!
- A small token of our affection.
Seventh grader.
We put him in your locker.
You can torment him if you like?
Just go.
Guys find somebody else.
But you're exactly what we're looking for, Rico.
Hey!
My name is not Rico and I don't need lackeys.
Don't you guys get it?
I hate you creepos.
You're scum.
Oh, really?
I'd like to hear you say that again.
- You're scum!
- Good, now smack me.
No, right here.
OK, everybody, books under your desks.
It's pop quiz day.
That is so unfair, Mr. Turner.
You caught us totally off guard.
Totally.
Gee, if you're not ready, we'll just postpone 'till tomorrow.
No, no.
Those of us who haven't prepared will just have to pay the price.
So go ahead, pop us.
OK.
Number-two pencil, anyone?
After reviewing the disciplinary report from your last school, I was expecting a much brasher young man.
But I must say, you've been quiet and polite.
Now, if this is an attempt to lull me into a false sense of security, I warn you, Griffin Hawkins, nobody pulls the wool over the eyes of George Feeny.
Mr. Feeny, Griffin Hawkins is here.
Who?
- The new transfer student.
- Hi.
I'm Griffin Hawkins.
Call me Griff.
Thanks for filling in for me.
I didn't think I'd make it.
I'm not usually a morning person, but I wanted to make a good impression.
- You're Griffin Hawkins?
- He sure is.
Thank you, Miss Gill.
You may go.
- Do I have to?
- Yes.
Erica, we'll finish up later.
Take a seat, Mr. Hawkins.
Take another seat, Mr. Hawkins.
I figure, I'll be sitting in this seat so much, I just wanted to take in the view from your side.
Mr. Hawkins, I will make this short and to the point.
This is my school.
You are a guest in my school.
And while you're here, you will toe the line and respect the rules.
Now, what is your first class?
English Lit.
Hey, kid!
Room 103, and take good notes.
Fine, Mr. Hawkins, that frees you up for detention with me.
Boy, that L.L. Bean catalog sure had some great stuff.
Topsiders, tennis sweaters I feel like a stinkin' Kennedy.
And I was pleased to see that vertical stripes are a preppy staple.
I'm gonna count to three, turn around and you're gonna be gone.
One, two, three.
Hey!
Guys, find somebody else.
Excuse me, I'm supposed to be in English class.
Can anyone tell me where the cafeteria is?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa I believe you were first.
Oh!
Who's this guy think he is?
Guys?
Guys?
Hey, guys, it's me.
Rico.
- There he is.
- Wow, look at him.
Cool, confident - I changed my mind.
I can't talk to him.
- Hey, hey, hey Don't get shy on me now.
You guys are perfect for each other.
Yeah, but Oh, no, he's looking this way.
Joey, hide me.
What, are you kidding me?
OK, guys, guys All right, look, he's all by himself.
- Why don't you go make your move?
- I don't know.
Hey, Griff!
- Do I know you?
- No, but as a guy with a reputation myself, I admire your work.
Eric Matthews.
- Hey.
- How are ya?
I was wondering if you knew my friends, Joey and Frankie?
- Hi, I'm Joey, this is Frankie.
- Hello.
Hey, I saw you guys.
I saw you guys hanging out at school.
- Ha!
Huh!
- You sure it was us?
You were the guys sucking quarters out of the soda machine, right?
Oh, yeah, you want change for a dollar?
Frankie, burp.
It's OK, it's OK.
I'm - So, what can I do for ya?
- Well, actually, Griff, I think the question is, what can they do for you?
We're lackeys.
I've gotten a two, but never together.
- What you get?
- 96.
- Well, jump up and down!
- I can't.
- Why not?
- Because we both know I studied for it.
So did I. That's why we didn't tell anybody.
Yeah, but I feel like a cheater.
Shawn, I can't live like this.
I never should have studied.
Boy, what I wouldn't give for an F right now.
Oh, oh my stomach.
This is the way it is.
We both studied and we got good grades.
Now deal with it.
Oh oh now my head hurts.
We gotta tell Turner.
It's the right thing to do.
No, Cory, come on!
I got a 92.
This one grade alone gives me a decent shot at a trade school.
Oh oh, boy ah Come on, can't you just take them on a trial basis?
Look at these little faces.
It's really tough to say no to you guys, but uh, no.
- You the lady-killer?
- I like to think so.
- So you're Griff?
- Over here.
So you're Griff.
Must be tough to live in a world where not everyone's name is stitched on their jacket Tommy.
I heard you were funny.
I heard a lot of things about you.
You can't believe everything you hear.
You know, well, I heard it from Laurette.
My girlfriend.
Well, her you can believe.
You wanna step outside and talk about this?
Actually, we'd love to step outside and talk.
We just love to talk.
Frankie and me, we're a couple of regular chatterboxes.
Maybe you've seen our show, Meet the Fist?
- Hey, look, this is between me and him.
- No, we're between you and him.
OK, then, uh Just have her home by ten.
Great.
See, Griff, they're very handy.
It would save me time talkin' my way out of these inevitable situations.
Hey, you've not even scratched our surface.
- What else do you do?
- Just different variations of that.
Mr. Turner?
Matthews and Hunter, the A-team.
How does it feel, being at the top of the curve?
- Great!
Glad we talked about it.
Bye.
- No, my stomach.
Mr. Turner, I gotta tell you We knew about the quiz in advance.
We We kind of saw it at your house in your lesson plan.
- The one I left open on my desk?
- Yeah.
The one I easily could have covered, but I didn't?
Yeah, that's the one.
All right, what's going on here, Mr. Turner?
If that's your real name.
- I want you to get good grades.
- By letting us cheat?
Guys, that assignment has been the homework for the last two weeks.
It has?
Wait.
You mean you want us to know what to study?
Well, I'm lost.
It's the whole idea.
I stand in front of the class and talk, you learn.
It's called education.
So that's why this building exists.
Some of us are students and some of us are teachers.
And if the students listen to the teachers, then Oh, I almost got it.
- Then they get good grades.
- Yeah, but why?
!
Why do you think, Shawn?
Because if you get good grades, it means you've actually learned something.
- Am I close?
- Close.
- Wouldn't you say, George?
- I must say I'm surprised, Mr. Turner.
You know, guys, you can get A's again, anytime you want.
You mean we can look at your lesson plan?
Absolutely.
It's up there on the blackboard, everyday.
Whoa!
Now get outta here.
Go home and open a book.
You got it.
Hold it, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Hunter.
Am I to understand that you've heard all this and are now going home to open a book?
- Yeah, we heard him load and clear.
- He was talkin' right to us.
- I believe we said $20.
- Yeah, yeah.
Whoa, who was that?
You like it, you got it.
Come on, Frankie.
Yogi, Boo Boo, back.
I just want to know her name.
Yo, cookie!
What's your name?
Guys!
If you're gonna hang with me, you gotta chill.
Mellow out.
Shawn, look, there they are.
The thugs formerly known as thugs.
Shawn, look!
A trash can.
Let's take a look inside.
Isn't that dangerous with Frankie and Joey watching?
I am scared, but I'm willing to take a chance.
Hey, hey can we?
Knock yourselves out.
Hello!
- Shawn, is it safe?
- No, I hear someone coming.
Hey, where'd you get the gum?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
OK, guys, yearbook time.
As you look back on your first year at John Adams, what would you consider your greatest accomplishment and why?
Let's see I mean, there's so many.
It's hard to pick just one.
- There's the time we - No.
No, that wasn't us.
- What about the time we?
- Also not us.
You guys are the two most pathetic students in this school.
That's an accomplishment.
She's right, Shawn.
I mean, the year's almost over and I haven't made a name for myself.
- And you know whose fault it is?
- Your own?
No, why should I take the fall?
I blame the jocks!
Why?
Because they wear those stupid jackets and therefore get all the girls.
What chance do I have?
Whoa.
Major growth spurt.
Too heavy.
Please don't.
Please don't.
I had a fat, heavy breakfast.
We've got an opening of the 108-pound super-confetti-weight division on the wrestling team.
Savage?
Perfect.
Congratulations, kid.
You're on the wrestling team.
Yeah!
Like there's a chance in the universe I'd ever want to be on your stupid wrestling team.
- Here's your jacket.
- Ooh.
- Look, Shawn, my jacket.
- Here's your uniform.
My uniform.
This is like Christmas here.
- Here's your candy.
- Candy?
Hi, I'm Candy.
Sweet.
Eric, put Cory down.
I can't.
I can't breathe.
He's got my windpipe in a death grip.
Cory, let your brother breathe.
Remember, pal, I know where you sleep.
Amy, when the exterminators were here spraying, did we leave the window open in Cory's room?
Eric, why is Cory so wound up?
I don't know!
I'm upstairs brushing my teeth and the little squirt bull-rushes me from behind.
It's all here in this permission slip.
Sign it, please.
Permission slip.
Amy!
Our little Cory made the wrestling team!
All right!
Get your old man a pen!
Now, Alan, we should discuss this.
Wrestling is dangerous.
Oh, come on.
If he were signing up for ballet, that might be dangerous.
Here.
Now wait a second, Dad.
Look, I know these wrestlers.
They're like psychotic, caged animals, waiting to take all their aggressions out on little runts like Cory.
Use my pen.
A toast to Cory Matthews!
The newest member of the John Adams High wrestling team.
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
Chug!
What?
Am I dribbling?
No, Matthews.
What are you gonna do with the can?
- Recycle.
Of course.
- No!
Crush it.
Like this.
It's all bone up here.
You can't damage anything.
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'm just gonna go visit the white lights.
Hey, you OK?
Yes, Pat.
But I'd like to solve the puzzle.
- Cory.
- What?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
So I'll finally have cool stuff to put in the yearbook.
And this jacket is a babe magnet.
Matthews, look.
Two cans.
Aaah!
Let's get out of here before she reloads.
So it was Nixon who became the first American president to travel to China.
Thereby Excuse me, what's going on here?
Well, Mr. Feeny, you were on me about cutting class and so this is the only time the masseuse can do me.
So Nixon, China, I'm all ears.
Anna, really bad knot.
Knead it right here.
All right, that does it.
Out!
- You gonna crack my back?
- Don't tempt me.
I am sick and tired of your antics.
This school was meant for education, not for your own personal pleasures.
I couldn't agree with you more.
We are back from the airport, Grif.
We got your lobsters.
- Lobsters?
- Flown in fresh from Maine.
- I could eat mine right now.
- They're still alive, Frankie.
I said what I said.
Mr. Feeny, care to join us for a late lunch?
There's a four-pounder with your name on it.
Young man, I want you to go to my office and wait for me.
- Just Mr. Hawkins.
- Where Grif goes, we go.
Gentlemen, don't you have lives of your own?
No, sir.
And what happens when Mr. Hawkins is not around to tell you what to do, if say, he's expelled?
Like that could ever happen.
- It could happen.
- What?
Then I'd have to get my own life.
- I'd consider it.
- But all the good lives are taken.
I'll see you after class.
We're all alone, Frankie.
What should we do?
Well, I don't know about you, but I'm gonna get some butter.
Cory.
You were supposed to meet me in the caf so we could finish these yearbook write-ups.
Topanga, relax.
Here, here's everything you need to know about Cory "the Cory" Matthews.
I know, the nickname needs a little work.
Making the wrestling team.
Meeting Candy.
'Ruh'"?
Rrrrh!
Good boy!
Goodbye.
Hey, Topanga, you want to ask me some more questions - for the yearbook?
- Uh, yeah.
Where do you think Cory's gonna end up in 10 years?
- You mean me, don't you?
- That's what I said.
- No, you said, "Cory.
" - I did not.
- You like him.
- I do not.
You say that again, I will kill you!
You like him a lot.
Break it up!
Let 'em go!
All right, Matthews, which one of these goons threw the first punch?
This goon.
- No, seriously.
- I did.
I'm on the wrestling team and we were just horsing around.
It's what jocks do, and I am a jock.
Oh, man.
I hope you're not a rare blood type.
Mr. Turner, sidebar.
I'm the only one in my weight class.
I never have to fight.
What can go wrong?
Matthews, you got a fight.
AB-negative.
Universal recipient.
That should come in handy.
You gotta earn this jacket, buddy.
Somebody else just signed up in your weight class.
What exactly is the range in my weight class?
No, Matthews, not Frankie.
Someone who's looking to make a name for himself.
Be his own person, carve his own niche.
Yeah, Matthews.
I'm gonna carve me a niche right in your stinking head.
Nice jacket.
Ha-ha-ha.
Rrrrh!
Oh, that's pretty amazing.
I tried lifting weights, but man, are they heavy.
You sure you know what you're doing, taking Joey on?
Absolutely.
'Cause he's not taking me seriously.
You know, I bet he's not even training.
Hey, Matthews!
Come to watch the enemy train?
Why am I always wrong about everything?
We don't want you here in our camp.
Maybe this is a closed-door session.
Maybe I'll just whip your sorry elfin duck-face now.
Joey, Joey.
Your opponent is playing mind games with you.
Ignore, and focus on the task at hand our training.
Balance.
Now, this is a wrestling technique I picked up while I was touring Japan last summer.
It's called "Push the wrestler out of the ring.
" Shawn, there's a little voice inside my head saying, "Do not fear Joey.
" A little voice saying, "I can beat Joey.
" And another voice saying, "Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow"!
Whoa, it's my son, Cory "the Cory"!
Hey, ready for your big wrestling match?
Alan, are you really gonna let him go through with this?
Mom, I'm not a little boy any more.
Oh, you're right, you're grown up now.
If you want to walk out that door and wrestle, I am OK with it.
I'll just be upstairs looking at your baby book crying.
Chicks.
Listen, I made you a very special protein drink.
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah, it's got 12 eggs in it, wheatgrass, soy, goat's milk and just a little touch of Tabasco.
I used to drink this when I boxed in the Navy.
- Gotta go!
No time for breakfast.
- Hey, have something.
Ah!
Oh!
Make way!
Not on my azaleas, man!
OK, look, Joey trained with Frankie, the immovable object.
My advice to you move.
To the winner goes the jacket and the spot on the team.
Now, let's go!
Shake hands.
Aw, he moved, Frankie.
Is that in the rules?
What the heck are you doin'?
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, yeah!
I won!
I won!
- Lost to Matthews?
I don't think so.
- I got the jacket, though, right?
He beat you by the rules, fair and square.
OK, then I challenge Matthews to another fight.
Unfair and unsquare, after hours.
Mano a rat-o.
I don't need to fight you, Joey.
I already proved myself.
Now I think you're proving yourself to be yellow.
I'll bet you bleed lemonade.
Oh, you can run, but you can't hide, Matthews.
You remember this face, 'cause it's gonna haunt ya.
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Collect call for Cory Matthews.
Uh, I accept.
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Yellow!
Enough already, Joey.
Just leave me alone.
Matthews, you wanna get rid of him?
Just pound the creep.
- Are you a jock, or aren't you?
- Yeah!
All right, Joey.
You want me, you got me.
Good!
Tonight, midnight.
The abandoned warehouse on Seventh.
No, 4:00, Feeny's backyard.
No, 8:00, the abandoned shipyard by the pier.
- No, dinnertime, my kitchen.
- Is it abandoned?
Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen.
You have a score to settle, now I respect that.
But settle it on neutral territory.
Like the gym, tomorrow night.
Grif, I don't exactly have a set of keys to get in.
Oh.
Neither does Janitor Bud.
Shawn, why did I agree to fight Joey?
I mean, who am I kidding?
I'm not a jock.
If Joey wants this stupid jacket so much, he can have it.
Backing down from a fight, now that takes guts.
It's just Grif and a couple of thugs.
Who cares what they think?
I mean, it's not like it's in front of the entire school.
You see?
Wrong about everything.
Come on, Cory, let's bail.
Matthews, where do you think you're going?
He thinks I'm this Cory Matthews guy, too.
I don't get it.
That's, like, the eighth person today who's said that.
- Wow!
I'll see you later, OK?
- No, I don't think so.
I put a lot of work into this.
Phone calls were made, favors were called in.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Goulet.
Thank you.
Oh, say can you see?
By the dawn's early light and the home Of the brave Thank you.
OK, are you ready to rumble?
Joey "the Rat" Epstein verses Cory "the Cory" Matthews.
And before we get started, I'd like to introduce some of the VIPs with us tonight.
From TV's Baywatch, Yasmine Bleeth.
Grif, how did you ever get me to do this?
Oh, yeah.
Help, I'm drowning!
- What?
- It was worth a shot.
And now one of John Adams' all-time, legendary thugs.
You know him as Frankie Stecchino's father, the rest of the word knows him as the 11 times heavy-weight wrestling champion of the world, Vader.
Thank you, Bob.
Thank you, very much.
Matthews let me tell you something.
If Joey won't get the job done, Vader will.
Because I am fear.
Stick around, and find out who the real man is.
I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't get your name.
Oh, my God!
All right!
Get to your corners and come out fighting when you hear the sound of the ding-dong.
Give my best to Vera, huh?
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Goulet.
- Cory, I didn't know you were fighting.
- What are you doing here?
The guy in the parking lot sold me a ticket.
He said, "Go see an idiot get pounded.
" "See an idiot get pounded.
" Cost me 50 bucks, but it was worth it.
Sitting next to the girl from Baywatch.
Oh, man.
I gotta get out of here before this thing starts.
Cory, what's this thing for?
Oops!
Frankie, tag me.
Tag me!
Ha-ha!
Yeah!
- Hey, this really isn't fair.
- Good.
Cory!
Cory!
Come on, get out.
- Get out, come on.
- OK, but you're in.
What?
Aah!
Son!
You're taking too long.
Give Daddy a tag.
Hah!
This chump's mine!
Hey, pal!
You can't do that to my brother!
Make me, you little rug rat!
Put the Matthews boy down!
Come over here and say that.
Yo, Matthews.
Sidebar.
Are you kidding me?
I thought you said you'd never have to fight.
Mr. Turner, you should know by now, I'm wrong about absolutely everything.
Sit him down, now.
Feeny, you can't tell me what to do anymore.
I'm not one of your punk students.
I'm the face of death!
It was scarier when you had acne.
Your little bully tactics didn't work back then, and they're not gonna work now.
Now, put him down.
- Make me!
- I'd be glad to - Leslie.
- You wouldn't.
I would.
All right, all right.
You won this round.
But next time, and there will be a next time, Texas death match.
Loser leaves town.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is why I avoid reunions.
Shawn, you think if I stayed in the ring I would've had a shot?
Yeah, and you also had a shot at dating Yasmine Bleeth.
Really?
Did she say something?
You break my heart sometimes, Cory.
Heard you wanted to see me, Matthews.
Yeah, I don't really need this anymore.
Thanks for the shot.
You're OK, Matthews.
He always was.
Candy, where you going?
I go with the jacket.
Didn't you know that?
I probably should have.
Hey, guys.
I gotta hand in yearbook write-ups tomorrow, and I still have a couple more questions for Cory.
You like him.
Shut up.
I need a quote to go with your picture, unless you still wanna go with "Rrrrh.
" Well, what'd you put for you?
"I do my thing and you do your thing.
"You are you and I am I. "And if in the end we end up together it's beautiful.
" Put the same for me.
Well, that was quite a stunt you pulled, Mr. Hawkins.
But am I mad?
No.
Actually, I'm downright giddy.
Because when the bell rings at the end of the day, I know that you'll be on your merry way to my classroom for detention.
Every day, for the next four years.
Mr. Feeny, you can't leave me alone with these guys.
I'm not one of them.
The walls, they're closing in.
Pity.
Matthews, relax.
It's gonna be OK.
Obviously you've never done detention with Grif.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robert Goulet.
I want to see some smiling faces I can spot some laughter through those tears Thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey, Cor, it's your dad.
He's doing career day.
All right.
It's not all right.
Today we find out I'm not a basketball player's son.
My dad is a grocer.
I'm a grocer's son.
I'm a son of a grocer.
Hey, Shawn, Cory, umm Guess how many different kinds of rice we have?
- Oh, no.
- Come on, Shawn, guess.
- Ten?
- Ten.
counting the short grains.
Throw them in Forget about it!
- Cory?
- Yeah?
I'm glad I'm not you.
First of all, I would like to say thank you to the parents for being here.
After they speak, you guys should have a better idea of what kind of vocations interest you.
Let me guess, Hunter - summer vocation?
Find some new material, will ya?
Our first speaker is Topanga's father, Jedediah Lawrence.
Thank you, Mr. Turner.
I think I should begin by telling everybody what I do - I'm a luthier.
- And I'm a Presbyterian, but to each his own, I say.
A luthier makes musical instruments.
No offense, sir, but that's got to be the nuttiest religion I ever heard.
Ha!
Don't worry, it's not you.
Daddy, forget about all that.
Tell them who called last night.
Oh, they don't want to hear about that, Tippy.
Tippy?
!
- Tippy's nice.
- It's my new favorite name.
Well, it's really no big deal, but Bruce.
- Bruce Springsteen?
- Uh-huh.
I took the call.
He said, "Hey, little girl, is your daddy home"?
So you make guitars for a lot of big rock stars?
Most of them.
He can make 'em, but can he play 'em?
But I guess my real love is playing these things.
- He's toast.
- He's toast.
I'm toast.
Please sit down, sit down.
Come on, plenty more show.
OK, let's see.
Our next parent is - Please no, please no, please no - Please no, please no, please no Mr. Alan Matthews!
Cory's father is a grocer.
Now, you probably think that all he's going to talk about is how many different types of rice he stocks.
Ha!
I'm sure there's a lot more to it than that.
Alan?
Well, uh Uh, thank you for that, uh intro.
I don't..
I don't know a lot of rock stars, but, uh I do know this I take pride in what I do.
Everybody needs groceries.
I'd like to think we do more than sell lettuce and pickles and potato chips and bug spray.
Umm we sell dreams.
What aisle?
All right, who didn't get a coupon?
Have a couple left here.
This one this one's for liquid soap.
I guess I'll leave them here.
Thank you very much, Alan.
Thank you.
That took guts.
Shawn, was that as bad as I think it was?
Not for me.
I got 60 cents off Apple Jacks.
OK, let's see.
Our next parent is Sorry I'm late.
Uh, actually, I was out in the hall having a smoke.
Don't endorse it, don't deny it.
Dad!
I thought you were gonna be outta town?
Oh, if anybody asks, I am.
- Hi, Teach, Chet Hunter.
- How are ya?
OK, everyone, let's welcome Shawn's father.
Chet Hunter.
Shawn, what does your dad do for a living?
Shh I want to find out.
What do I do for a living?
You've got one man here who makes things with his own two hands.
You've got another one, puts food on America's table.
And my hat's off to both of them.
Me?
Well, it's kind of hard to put your finger on what I do.
- Shawn, you're not breathing.
- Sorry.
Mostly I buy and sell things.
Sometimes a refrigerator, sometimes a car.
Why, once I even sold an entire nation.
What I sell best are ideas.
That's what I am - I'm an idea man.
A few years ago, I had an idea for an all-news TV station.
Going all the time, all over the world.
- You invented CNN?
- That's exactly what I called it.
CNN - Chet's News Network.
But I made the mistake of yapping to a southern fellow 'bout it on an elevator.
- What did you say your last name was?
- Turner.
No relation.
- Wow, he's somethin'.
- Yeah, somethin'.
By show of hands, how many of you have a microwave oven?
You're welcome.
You know something?
This SAT prep-course seems to really be working for me, man.
It's got me completely focused and prepared.
It's like I'm in the SAT Zone.
All my other senses are completely shut down.
- Eric?
- Hmm?
You just spilled soup on your lap.
What?
Aah!
Remember that world series game where the first baseman let that easy ground ball go under his legs, and his team lost and he was humiliated in front of the entire world?
- Yeah?
- I envy his son.
Oh, come on, Cor.
Your dad wasn't that bad.
The cantaloupe is your friend?
- OK, that part was bad.
- Your dad he was awesome.
Everyone loved him and he told great stories.
Yeah, stories, it's all he has.
Why do you think we live in a trailer park?
- Listen, at least no one's laughing at him.
- Your dad did fine.
It's all in your mind.
Hey, Matthews, look!
I'm eating your dad's friend.
That's it!
I've gotta move to another school district.
I'm telling you, man, I've got business here.
Listen, I'm not gonna say this again.
If you're not faculty or staff, you have no business on this campus.
Hey, leave me alone, pal.
I'm George Feeny.
I'm the principle of this here high school.
- And you're not George Feeny!
- I'm parked in his spot, ain't I?
Mr. Feeny, I can explain.
- Please do.
- Go ahead.
- Uh, you're Feeny, too?
- I'm Feeny one.
Mr. Feeny, this is my dad.
Oh Yes, well, uh we're very proud of Shawn.
- I'm surprised to hear you say that.
- So am I. Hey, Shawny Shawn's friend.
- So, Dad, what's going on?
- Uh look buddy Did you did you kiss your mom this morning?
- Uh-huh.
- Good.
'Cause it's gonna have to last you for a while.
What do you mean?
Your mother she took off.
Oh, just go home and wait.
She always comes back.
Oh, not that easy.
This time she took the house.
See, that's the problem with having a mobile home.
It's uh uh You can move it.
- Maybe she went to get it washed.
- Yeah.
- So, what are we gonna do?
- We're going to go after her.
- You still got that keen sense of smell?
- Dad, I can't just ditch classes.
I mean I can, but shouldn't I tell somebody?
OK, but I gotta run before that little guy with the mustache has a duck.
You.
Your father, the cantaloupe man He's good people.
Mark my words.
- Shawn, you OK?
- Why wouldn't I be OK?
Oh you mean because my mom drove our home away?
Well that vocabulary review was exhilarating and revitalizing.
And to think I thought the SAT's would be my bete noire.
Shut up.
Eric, you OK?
I'm sorry.
I'm just so tense from studying for the SAT's.
I've got this stiffness in my back and all across my shoulders I just can't shake.
- Son - Yeah?
You have a coat hanger in your back.
- What?
- Watch this.
It's the greatest trick I've ever seen.
- What happened to you?
- Oh, Dad, I'm not doing very well.
You didn't go to college.
Why do I have to go?
Because someday your son is going to have a career day.
And if you don't go to college, your son's teacher is going to stand up in front of all the cool parents and say, "Here's the grocer.
" Go to college.
Don't think I can.
Why try?
What's the point?
We're all just gonna die anyway.
Well, aren't we nihilistic.
Or should I say, vacuitous.
If you're so smart, how come you don't understand shut up?
See?
You know something, Dad?
I'm gonna be OK.
I don't need college.
I'm gonna do very well in the outside world, relying on my street-smarts and natural instincts.
Aah!
- Hi!
What's the matter with Eric?
- Oh, he put his hand on the stove.
Again?
Ohh-ha-ha!
My fault.
I left the iron on.
- So, tell me, how did career day go?
- Oh, terrific, terrific.
You remember the world series, where that first baseman let that ground ball - dribble through his legs?
- Uh-huh.
I envy him.
Come on, it couldn't have gone that bad.
You know, I have worked very hard to become a respectable family man.
And this morning, I realized I'd passed way beyond respectability and I've soared all the way up to boring.
- Says who?
- Amy, I manage a supermarket.
I sign for deliveries, I approve checks.
Alan, that's what you do at work, but that's not all of what you do.
Besides, would I have married you if you were boring?
Apparently.
I bet you Cory's very proud of you and he can't wait to tell you.
Dad?
- What?
- Uh, did Shawn call?
Uh, no, Cor.
Why, something wrong?
Yeah, his mom took off.
He went with his dad to go look for her.
- Oh, poor Shawn.
- Well, hasn't this happened before?
Yeah, but this time she took his house.
- Not a good sign.
- Aah!
Also not a good sign.
He's fine, he's fine!
Your son is fine.
He just needs some ice.
See, just as I promised.
No student conferences, no George Feeny telling us what to do Just music, wine, candles and two consenting adults consenting.
You know, Johnny, we've been seeing each other now for three months?
And I was just wondering where's this going?
Cold, I'm cold Jonathan, this time we're gonna talk about it.
Absolutely, we're gonna talk.
No more avoiding it.
I did not plan this.
Hi, Mr. Turner.
Sorry for bugging you.
I, um had a question.
Am I interrupting anything?
Hey, look, it's Miss Tompkins!
- Yeah, I know.
- Boy, you teachers sure work late Oh Sorry, Mr. Turner, but I didn't know you guys had personal lives.
- Hunter.
- How ya doing?
- You wanna come in?
- But you've got company - It's OK.
- Kat, where you going?
Yeah, you don't have to leave.
Stay, we'll hang.
Another time.
- We'll talk.
- We'll talk?
I like her.
Do you like her?
I like her.
Yeah, I do.
So, Hunter, what are you doing out so late?
Well, you know, uh my dad's out looking for my mom and I had this thought OK.
about the homework.
You know that Forrest Hemingway guy?
- When do we get to read his stuff?
- Next year.
OK.
Just checkin'.
I heard he was good.
You came all the way over here for that?
You're the English teacher.
I figured there was no one else I could ask.
I'm flattered.
Boy, you guys were really having a dinner, huh?
- There's plenty left over if you're hungry.
- No I ate and everything.
- I'll put it away?
- No, I might pick at it.
Would a napkin slow you down?
So Shawn, where you staying until your father gets back?
Oh, a great place.
My dad gave me some money, so I'm staying at the motel down the street.
The one down on Seventh?
Are you sure you're gonna be all right there?
Oh, yeah.
The guy in the cashier's cage gave me clean sheets and everything.
If you wanna save your money, you could just crash here tonight.
Nah, I already paid the guy five bucks to turn on the TV.
Have a seat on the couch.
Watch some free TV.
Give me a minute to clean up the kitchen and I'll drop you off.
OK.
You know, you're going to be staying down the road, you know feel free to drop by.
I mean, you know, we could eat, we could talk or not talk.
We could just hang, you know.
What's going on at home can't be easy on you.
So, Shawn, I mean, you know, anytime you just I talk, he sleeps.
It's like class.
George, what was I supposed to do?
His old man dumps him off at this fleabag motel and takes off.
I was not about to wake the kid up and take him back there.
- Where is he now?
- I dropped him off at the Matthews'.
Well, I'm sure Shawn's father Frightening man, isn't he?
I'm sure he'll be able to find his way back home.
After all, if a pigeon can do it But I would be careful though, Jonathan.
It's a fine line between authority figure and chum.
I know that, George, but come on Really, what would you have done?
I truly don't know.
Hey, guys!
Office hours?
Morning, Alan.
I'd like to say thanks again for helping out at career day.
- I thought you were terrific.
- Anytime.
Those kids get rowdy, out of control, you call me, I'll be happy to swing by and sedate them.
Try it for 40 years and see how you feel.
- Could you come in here, please?
- I'll be there in a minute.
- Uh, now, please.
- What's the matter?
- Chet Hunter is here.
- Oh, Amy, that's not funny.
No, I'm not laughing either.
You guys mind if I join ya?
There's a couple of things I'd like to say to the man.
Sure, come on.
- Jonathan?
- Yeah?
It's a fine line.
Tread softly.
Yeah.
- So where are you staying tonight?
- Uh, motel's fine.
At least 'till my dad gets back.
Why don't you come over tonight?
We could skateboard in the pool and they've got cable.
- We've got cable.
- Not like this place.
- You can't just live in a motel.
- Why not?
At least you know it's not gonna drive away.
Listen, you know you could have crashed here last night.
I know, I was fine.
I know you're fine, I'm just saying.
I don't know, just remember I'm your friend.
I know.
It's OK, Cory, you don't have to worry about me.
- Really.
- Hey, Shawn, come on down, son!
See?
My dad's back and everything's great.
Teach, what you did for my boy last night, well, I just want to look you in the eye and say thanks.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
'Cause the important thing is knowing that my boy's safe and being looked after.
- Hey, Dad, did you find mom?
- I did.
I did find her, but she gave me the slip again.
You gotta respect that.
Now, to that end, I have something on my mind -which is why I'm here.
- Thought I was why you're here.
- You are!
You are, you little Slim Jim.
That you are.
This is all about you.
Johnny, look Uh this is hard to say.
- I ain't always been the perfect father - Dad, it's OK.
- Adam, I consider you a friend - Alan.
I respect you.
Yes, sir, you are the heartbeat of America.
People can count on you.
You got roots.
- I like that.
- Where's this heading?
I need a favor.
My wife, Verna, she's she's out there.
And my heart's out there with her.
Not to mention my wallet and major credit cards.
But she is my wife and go after her I must.
- And the favor?
- Take care of my boy.
Now you don't have to answer right now Well, yes, you do.
- Stay here?
That would be great.
- Dad, why can't I just come with you?
Oh, come on.
The road's no place for a boy.
Especially with your mama out there driving on it.
Nah, your place is here.
In school, with Teach over there.
In this house, in the company of these fine people.
No pressure.
Chet, shouldn't you be asking Shawn what he thinks?
- Whatever.
It's fine with me.
- We're only talkin' a few days.
Couple of weeks, tops!
I'll call in every night.
So, what's the verdict, Your Honor?
Mrs. Honor?
Shawn, you know we'd be very happy to have you stay.
- Alan?
- Of course.
Shawn, you have a room here as long as you need it.
See, if my boy can't be with his own father, I'm glad he can be with a good father.
And you, sir Why, you're are a good father.
He's fine he's fine!
Don't panic, it's just a little nosebleed.
How long has that tree been out there?
Well, anyway, Alan If I can kick in to the house kitty, why, you let me know.
I think we can handle it 'till we get coupons.
Even better.
Shawn, what do you say we go move your stuff?
Oh, wait, it's already movin'.
Let's go get you a toothbrush and a new shirt.
Teach Ma'am Mr. Matthews It's Corky, right?
Yeah.
Hey, we're gonna be roommates, huh?
How great is that?
Think we're gonna find out.
I'll go get some clean sheets for your cot, Shawn.
- Uh, Chet?
- Mm-hmm?
You're gonna be back in a couple of weeks, right?
Texas women couldn't keep me from here.
You know, Alan, Chet was right about one thing.
You're a good man.
- Dad?
- Um.
Uh, listen I never really thanked you for coming to school yesterday.
Ahh no problem.
Sorry I couldn't compete with that guitar player and that foot doctor.
That's only because you left out the most important thing you do.
- What's that?
- What you do after work.
I mean, around here - for us, for our friends.
- Aw, that's nothing.
- It's everything.
I mean, I was thinking I was the son of a grocer, but now I know what I really am is well the son of my father.
Thanks.
I must say, I am reveling in the mastication of these tasty comestibles.
Superlative victuals.
And the libations Ya-ha!
Well, looks like your SAT preparation is under control.
Totally copacetic.
I'm calmer, my senses are back, I'm healing.
I'm actually starting to think I'm gonna do pretty well on this test.
Only part that scares me is that math section.
Hoo-hoo Uh come again Math section.
Half the test is verbal, half is math.
- Half?
!
- Yeah.
Like what?
30, 40 percent?
Half 50.
- I got no time, I gotta study- - Calm down.
Calm down.
- No, can't calm.
Must panic.
- No, don't!
I hate SAT time.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Come on, Shawn, you've lived here three weeks and you've been in the bathroom two and a half of 'em.
Hey, will you shut up?
I'm trying to study here.
Well, I am.
Well, I'm trying to take a shower here.
Well, I am.
Almost done.
Just doing my burns.
Whoa, you shave?
See, facial hair sprouts early in my family, especially on my mom's side.
OK, nihilism is to optimism as gluttony is to Butte, Montana.
Wrong?
Oh, no!
Mind lock!
Three days before the SATs and I'm never even gonna get into you know, that place with the It's got the - College?
- College!
College - I gotta write that down.
Where's my pencil?
Where's my lucky pencil?
Hey, is this it?
Oh, thank you!
Pencie, you've come back to me!
Hey, Hunter, what the heck do you think you're doing?
Uh, cleaning out my ears?
Yeah, with Towelie?
My lucky towel?
Are you insane?
One of us is.
All right, look, Hunter, if you're gonna live here, there's a few rules you're gonna have to follow.
Guys, guys, guys!
Happy faces, huh?
We can live together.
It's only temporary.
And all things considered, I think we're doing pretty darn well, huh?
Yeah.
I think I'll get a little peace and quiet in here, huh?
Jeez.
Think he just found Slippy, his lucky soap.
Morgan, ice cream is not breakfast.
Shawn says his family has sundaes for breakfast all the time.
Oh, really?
You hear that, Amy?
Nutritional tips from the Hunter family.
Oh, Alan, Shawn is just so Morgan, wouldn't you just love to go watch TV right now?
- No.
- For a buck?
- Deal.
- All right, go on.
Get out of here.
You know, Amy, I like Shawn, I really do, but these past three weeks have not been the easiest.
Not on our nerves or our budget.
- Well, it isn't Shawn's fault.
- I don't blame him.
I blame Chet!
What kind of father abandons his son like that?
All this time, no phone call, no card, nothing!
I know.
I'm just glad that Shawn has Cory and Eric to make things easier for him.
Well, pardon me, Eric, for breathing your lucky air!
Morning, Shawn.
Would you like some breakfast?
No, thanks.
I'll help myself.
Yeah, Dad has this saying: "A cup?
Who are you trying to impress"?
Well, then, we'll just make that your carton.
Oh, by the way, I bought you some pants.
You bought him clothes?
Well, Alan, he can't just wear the same thing every day.
I do.
You know those jeans with all the holes in them?
You didn't chuck them, did you?
Oh, no, of course not!
No, I patched them.
And to go with them - This is for me?
- Yeah!
What do you think?
Wow.
It's really yellow.
Cool, we've got the same shirt.
- Johnny.
- Oh, hi.
- Sorry I took off so early this morning.
- Oh, that's OK.
Look, you left this at my place last night.
- I know, silly.
- Leave it in the bag, please.
Why?
I've got others.
You can keep this at your place.
I wouldn't know where to put it.
You don't have to get scared every time I leave something at your place.
I am not scared.
I'd be scared if I started wearing it.
Katherine.
Jonathan.
Are you brown-bagging it?
I thought we were having lunch.
Actually, George, it's mine.
Yeah.
And not exactly lunch.
Then what is it?
Ah.
I'm thinking a change of subject is in order.
Enjoy your lunch.
Shawn, is that the new shirt my mom gave you?
Yeah.
Looks all right now, huh?
Do you know what she's gonna do when she sees that?
My guess is - clean it, sew it back together, and put an "S" on it.
Look, she's just trying to be nice to you.
And I'm just trying to get through this thing without making any waves.
Matthews, how's it working out with Hunter?
Terrific.
Great.
I mean, we're best friends.
Listen, if anything comes up, the offer stands.
You call me at home any time you need to.
OK?
Giving your home number to students?
Come on, George.
Hunter's going through a tough time, and I'm his teacher.
Yes, you're his teacher, and only his teacher.
- You'd do well to remember that.
- Hold on.
You're always getting involved with the Matthews kids.
Eric, locker!
An unfortunate consequence of living next door.
Come on, come on, come on.
How long does it take to score a practice SAT exam?
All right, all right, all right.
Here it comes.
Your score is What?
!
Oh, come on, that's impossible.
You get 200 points just for signing your name.
Two Ts in Matthews!
Stupid, stupid!
Eric, get some sleep.
You've been up for days.
Your scores keep falling.
At this rate, you couldn't get into Clown College.
Is that a four-year school?
- Your brain needs a break.
- No, no, no, no.
Brain doesn't need break.
Brain needs oxygen.
See, there's just not enough oxygen in here.
But there's some outside, though!
Oxygen.
Good ol' H20.
I feel smarter already.
Do I look smarter?
Has your house been tested for radon?
Not another test!
I'm going home.
Well, fine.
That's more air for me!
So, Mr. Matthews.
SATs this Saturday, hm?
Yeah, me too.
You know, all students feel anxiety going into their college boards.
But there's no way around it.
They're very important.
Mr. Feeny, I'm not ready.
Eric, I once promised that I would never reveal this to any student, but there are three secrets to scoring well on the SAT.
Secrets that would unravel the entire college screening process as we know it.
Tell me!
Perhaps I will.
For a price.
- Mr. Feeny, you sly dog.
- No, no, no, no.
I'm doing a little landscaping around my house - laying down sod, planting a tree or nine.
- If you would help me - You'd tell me what the secrets were?
- Shh.
- Oh, shh.
What's with that dog?
Shawn?
It's a very cool dog.
I see it down by the corner.
No leash, no collar just having a great time barking at the moon.
No, wait.
I know that dog.
It's a stray.
It's probably barking 'cause he doesn't have a home.
He doesn't need a home.
That's what he's saying - "I need a home.
" No, you didn't hear him right.
He's happy out there because he's free.
No one's rubbing his nose in a carpet and saying, "Don't do that"!
You know, he looks lonely to me.
And cold.
And he looks like he doesn't have a friend in the world.
- He's got one now.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What are you doing?
- I got to get out.
You can't go out.
It's a school night.
We have a 9:00 curfew.
I don't do curfews, I don't do bedtimes, and if I want to clip my toenails at the dinner table, I don't appreciate all the dirty looks.
We were just covering our food.
All right, look, Shawn, my parents make the rules around here, OK?
I didn't ask to live here, man, and I don't need to ask your permission to leave.
What do you think I'm supposed to tell my parents?
Tell them I took myself out for a walk.
You know, I could look into your eyes forever.
Does that mean you wanna marry me?
Wait, you got that from that?
- Well, what does it mean, then?
- Nice eyes.
Jonathan, we've been together now for four months.
- And I need to know, do you love me?
- OK.
Uh If by that, do you mean, am I always happy to see you?
Do I enjoy being with you?
Do we always have fun together?
Then, yes, love.
- Jonathan.
- Yeah?
Listen to me.
You are a good, gentle man.
And I could spend the rest of my life with you and have children with you and know they will always be taken care of.
When you hold me, I feel safe.
Now, if you can't say the same to me with the same feeling, then don't let me give any more of my heart to you.
Go.
Kat, I-I-I just You take a compliment worse than any woman I've ever met!
Jonathan, you're the same age as I am.
Don't you feel like you need a commitment in your life?
- Yes, I do.
- Well, then, what are you waiting for?
Hunter, look, this really isn't a good time.
You're telling me.
He's a cop.
You Jonathan Turner?
You know this kid?
Yeah, Shawn Hunter.
I'm his teacher at John Adams High.
Officer, you wanna tell me what this is all about?
We spotted your friend here loitering outside the high school with some older kids.
- They had about 20 of these.
- Spray paint?
Looks like they were planning to do some redecorating.
No, no, no.
We were just gonna sell them to some bad kids.
And overcharge them.
Serves them right.
This one takes off down an alley.
We caught up with him outside your place.
Says he's staying with you.
Yeah, yeah, he's staying with me.
His folks are out of town.
Got called out of town to save a baby girl in East Virginia who fell down a blowhole, just like I told you.
Look, officer, I'm sorry.
I thought he was in his room.
If you wanna do your friend a favor, keep him in the house.
Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Turner.
Mrs. Turner?
Hey, congratulations.
No, Shawn, it's still Miss Tompkins.
Good night, Kat.
Good luck, Jonathan.
Stay!
- Well, how come she got to go?
- Because I got more to say to you.
A little girl who fell down a blowhole?
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Thanks for covering for me.
Cory's folks would've freaked if I showed up with that cop.
Oh, like this?
Would they have yelled at you like this?
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Would they have told you how stupid you are for being out so late?
- OK, I get your point.
- No, I don't think you do!
Fine, then I'll just get out of your way.
I thought you were cooler than that.
No, no, I'm not cool at all.
In fact, I get real old-fashioned when I see somebody that I care about being brought home by cops!
Mr. Turner, do you have to yell?
I've had a really rotten night.
Oh, do you see me ballroom-dancing here?
Look, is this gonna take all night?
'Cause I got places to be, man.
Hunter, you keep heading down this life track you're on, then the places you're going aren't any places you're gonna wanna be, man.
Look, I'm sorry I messed up your night.
Aw, I already messed it up before you got here.
Yeah, women.
- What do you know about women?
- What do you wanna know?
Oh, you think you can help me out, Hunter?
Hey, you helped me.
Now, see, why can't you be this sharp in my class?
Math's not my best subject.
I'm your English teacher.
Then why are you teaching math?
Are you kidding me?
Guys, breakfast.
Hey, Cor, where's Shawn?
I'm sorry.
Who?
Oh, Shawn, your best bud, the guy you're sharing your room with.
Oh, Shawn.
Yeah, he took off real early.
Like 9:00 last night?
Well, I wasn't looking at my watch, but do you two just know everything all the time?
No, but right now, I do know that Shawn is our responsibility.
But, Dad, Shawn needs space.
He's like a wild dog doing wild-dog things.
You had to be there.
Jonathan, thank you for the phone call.
Let us know what's going on in our own house.
- Hey, where were you last night?
- I was at Turner's.
Would you relax?
Cory and Shawn, upstairs - now!
First Shawn sneaks out, now Cory's lying to us.
When I told Chet I'd take Shawn in, I didn't mean forever.
When's the last time anybody heard from him?
When he backed out the driveway, hit our trash can and says, "It's OK, I'm all right.
" Hey, Dad, where do we keep our wWeed Whacker?
Wait, wait, wait.
Feeny's got you whacking weeds now?
He's helping Eric prepare for the college boards.
No, it's all right, Dad.
I got Feeny right where I want him.
He promised to tell me three secrets to SAT success.
Eric, I can see the weeds growing before my eyes!
And you still have the hedges to trim!
Right in the palm of my hand.
You know, it's not that Shawn is actually a bad kid, you know.
Machine will get it.
Go on.
I know how easy it is to act up when your family just isn't there for you.
Amy, Alan?
Chet Hunter here.
Was that the beep or is this thing tapped?
Wait, wait, Chet, wait.
Hi.
It's Amy.
Oh.
Hey, you sound out of breath there, dear.
Did I interrupt something?
Listen, Chet, where are you?
It's been three weeks.
Well, if the license tags are any indication, I'm either leaving Ohio or coming into Georgia.
Well, that doesn't sound anywhere near Philadelphia.
No, it's a Ew, road kill, porcupine.
How'd he not see that coming?
Chet, have you found your wife yet?
Nope, but I found the motor home, though.
Seems like my Virna traded in on a '92 Miata.
Nice car, but I don't think three people can live in it.
Listen, Chet, don't you think it's time you came back here?
Took some responsibility for your son?
Well, I wish I could, but unfortunately, I don't think I'm gonna be too much good to anybody till I find my Virna and win her back.
Oh.
Thought I left it on the table.
Chet, Shawn is having a very hard time.
And besides, we've got three kids of our own.
Alan.
We'll manage.
I don't think it's fair to Shawn or to us to live with this kind of open-ended commitment.
Look, Al, the boy needs somebody, OK?
Now, don't hang me up here.
If you're not coming back right now, then you be the one to tell your son.
- Oh, I just did.
- Huh?
Well, if I know my boy, even money, when adults are talking about him, he's probably somewhere behind 'em, listening.
Hi, there, big guy.
None of you want me.
Well, that's fine!
I don't need any of you!
I never needed anybody!
- Shawn, it's not that we don't want you.
- Shawn.
Come on, Shawn!
Shawn, unlock the door.
We know you're in there!
Shawn!
Fall down a blowhole, did you?
I'm not in class.
I don't have to listen to you.
- Where are you gonna run now?
- What do you care?
I was beginning to think I didn't care about anything.
Yeah, fine, whatever.
I got to go.
Yeah, I know.
I've been there.
Someone reaches out to you and says they care about you, it's easy to run.
I'm sure you got a lot of big emotional problems to work through here, but I just need to find a place to sleep, OK?
I'll do you one better.
How about I give you a home?
- What, your place?
- Yeah, my place.
For how long?
Three weeks and then you get sick of me?
Oh, I'm sick of you now, Hunter, but I'm still making the offer.
Why?
'Cause I'm thinking I should do something for somebody else.
I think I need that.
You're not gonna tell me what to do.
- Somebody's gotta.
- You're not my dad!
I'm not trying to be!
Look, I'm just offering you a roof and a window to crawl out of.
Although it is five stories up.
- I like a challenge.
- So do I. Oh, gosh!
Look, I'm gonna go square things with your dad.
'Cause that is what the responsible adult-type would do.
- So you're moving in with Turner, huh?
- You were listening?
Well, I was snagged up there for awhile.
I had to wait till a squirrel lost interest.
Yeah.
You know, Cory, your folks are great and all, but this seems right.
Yeah, I think so.
But you know what this means, don't you?
I mean, you're not a stray anymore.
Yeah.
So, what's it like to be a housebroken dog?
It's not so bad.
I mean, you get your meals regular, you get your own chew toy, and if you bring in the paper, they are so thrilled.
What if I hate it?
I'll have my mom and dad put in a doggy door for ya.
- Just leave a window open.
- You got it.
All right, Mr. Feeny.
I have been planting and hedging and mowing for three days now.
The SATs are tomorrow, and I demand to know the three secrets.
- Get a good night's sleep.
- What?
No, no, no, no.
No way.
Not until you tell me what the three secrets are.
I just told you one, Eric.
Sleep.
Sleep?
I can't sleep.
The test is tomorrow and I haven't thought about it in days!
Which is secret number two - clear your mind.
Care to take a guess at what secret number three is?
You're Satan?
How could you do this to me, Mr. Feeny?
Eric, do you know what SAT means?
Sat?
Scholastic Aptitude Test.
It measures what's up here.
Your natural ability to learn.
So, clear your mind, get some sleep, and trust yourself.
Those are the three secrets?
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
I feel better already.
Whoa!
Where are you going?
There's still the matter of pruning my azaleas.
The azaleas.
Of course!
I'll take care of that now.
Psych!
See, you already told me what the three secrets were.
- Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
- Did I say three?
Psych!
