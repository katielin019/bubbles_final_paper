{START OF EPISODE 1}
And the guy I'm supposed to have a meeting with is in 2-I, so I say to the doorman, "Excuse me, is there a 2-I in this building?
I'm looking for 2-I.
He's ignoring me.
I must have said "2-I" like 15 times.
The guy finally puts down his newspaper, looks right at me, and he only has one eye.
You lie.
That did not happen.
Swear to God he only had one functioning eye, and the other one was like a mini glazed doughnut a sort of congealed Paging new subject.
New subject to the white courtesy telephone!
So how's the Island?
Do you just run around naked all day in war paint chasing things with a pointy stick?
Grace It's the Virgin Islands.
It's not Fire Island.
But yes.
Sweetie?
I'm still holding the elevator.
Are you coming?
Oh, I'm--I'm talking to Will.
I'll meet you there.
Just order me what you're having.
Tofu scrambled on a bed of spinach?
Yeah.
Oh!
But, um, uh, instead of the spinach, I'll have chocolate chip pancakes.
Oh, hey, oh, oh!
Oh!
And eighty-six the tofu scrambled.
Thanks, sweetie.
You're the best.
Ok, the thing with Josh is getting very messy.
What's the problem?
Last time we talked, you and Josh were clicking along.
Yeah, but Ben and I are clicking along, too, and it's getting harder and harder to click two guys at the same time.
I thought this was the new you.
I thought you were making up for the "head gear years".
This whole thing has just gotten way too complicated.
I mean, the other night in bed, I called Josh "Ben".
to cover it, I stretched it out into bennnd overand I ended up doing something I really never wanna do again.
Good thing Ben's name isn't Pee-Wee.
Wilma!
Get your ass in the steam room asap.
Stan has some legal questions.
Oh, and he's wearing the shorty robe, so if I were you, I'd pick a point on the wall and focus on it.
Grace, I'm sorry.
I'm wanted in yet another nude business meeting.
No!
You do this to me every time we talk.
Grace, I would much rather talk to you than avert my eyes while Stan re-adjusts his soft currency, but I gotta go!
- Wilma, shift it!
- Honey, I'm sorry.
Damn it!
Thanks.
You can just put it on my tab.
And you know what?
Go ahead and give yourself a big, fat tip.
Thank you, Mr., Uh Truman.
Will Truman.
That's my name Will Truman Hey, Jack.
But you can call me Jack.
My friends call me Jack.
You wanna be my friend?
Thanks a lot, Grace.
Thank you very much!
That was the man I was gonna spend the rest of my life with.
We we gonna get married in Vermont and adopt Himalayan whistle kids.
But thanks to you, I'll be alone until-- Until the pizza boy delivers.
And, boy, does he ever!
Thanks for the remind.
- See you later.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What's going on with you?
I haven't seen you around the old spa lately.
Jack, just because you lie around there naked doesn't make it a spa.
It's a laundry room.
What's with the mood and the 'tude?
Nothing.
It's just It's--it's--it's really not your area.
Whaddaya talk?
Everything's my area.
Unless it's about your lady parts, 'cause that's more Will's area.
Come on Well, I've-- Have you ever dated two guys at the same time?
Forgive me.
It's just that I've been juggling Ben and Josh for a couple of months now, and I think I need to make a decision.
Boy trouble?
Now you're talkin' Jackanese!
Come on.
We'll have a steak.
You'll pour your heart out.
And to top it off, we'll rent a movie.
You're into gay porn, right?
Who isn't?
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 01 New Will City synchro: kingo I don't understand what's taking so long to set up one lousy offshore multinational holding company.
My husband and I want off this damn Island already.
It's hot, it's muggy.
There's nature everywhere you look.
It's hot.
So stop stringing those puka shells and get us up and running.
Yoy know, there are thousands of children in the third world who rely on the 11 cents an hour my husband pays them.
Do you really want that on your conscience?
Huh?
Do you?
Damn it, Stanley!
Not in front of the help!
I want this whole thing squared away within the next week.
Is that understood?
Oh, and, uh Get rid of those ridiculous strappy sandals you've been running around in.
You're not Jennifer Lopez, for God's sake!
- And another thing, I-- - Oh, shut up.
What?
Shut up!
For 3 months, I've been putting up with your yelling, your ranting, your barking drink orders at me-- I'm not gonna do it anymore!
I'm sick of this Island.
I'm sick of having more sand in my ass than Libya.
But mostly, I am sick of you.
Bu-- Cl-- Wha--!
I must have been out of my mind to take this gig in the first place.
Karen, I will see you back home where I'm actually needed.
Hey, you walk outta here and you can say goodbye to makin' partner!
Stanley, I'm sorry this didn't work out, but good luck and Damn, man!
Pull down that robe!
Ok, now, remember, let each gesture tell a little story the way she does, - Ok?
- I'll never be like her.
Well, of course not.
She's one of the great artists of all time.
But we're not gonna honor her by quitting, ok?
Now, come on, let's go again.
Oops!
I did it again I played with your heart got lost in the game oh, baby, baby.
Yes, that's totally it!
I actually feel the spirit of Britney in the room.
And you Are not that innocent.
Oh, gosh.
Ok.
I gotta go.
I gotta go see Ben.
And by the way, thank you so much for that advice.
You were so right.
Ben is the one for me.
Will!
- Hey!
- Hi!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
I came home.
I'm here.
Where's the love?
I just flew coach!
I need some love!
Oh, my god!
Look who's back!
Yay!
You look so tan and gorgeous!
Missed you.
Hey, lady!
You're back?
Don't worry.
You can still stay in the guest room, Kato.
Yay!
You're back!
Yay!
You're so tan and gorgeous!
Thank you.
- Oh, my god!
You're thin!
- Huh?
You've had something done.
Ho!
You've been sucked and tucked!
No, seriously, where did all your fat go?
Oh, there it is.
Well, listen, kids, I'm gonna skedooch so you two can make love.
FYI, I missed you.
Don't make a big deal out of it.
Just be happy a celebrity is talking to you.
I'll call you later, ok?
Kiss it.
Kiss it.
Spank it.
Peace out.
What-- What was that?
Oh, oh, that's just a-- just a thing that we do.
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Come, come, come!
Sit!
Tell me, tell me!
What are you doing back here?
Oh, the Island, it was awful.
And by awful, I mean Karen.
I--I-- And I missed you.
I just felt like every time we talked, I wasn't there for you.
But I've had plenty of time to consider your latest problem, and I think I have the fix.
What problem?
You know, your "torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool" thing.
Oh!
Oh, right.
Now, you know I love Ben, but I think in this case you should go with Josh.
I mean, yes, he's a little crunchy and groovy.
But he adores you, and That's what counts, right?
Right.
So there's the verdict.
Josh is the one you should be with.
I am so glad you're back!
And I hate to do this, but I have to go.
I've got a brunch, and I--I'd move it till later, but then it would be lunch.
Yeah.
Ok, well..
We'll talk about it later.
And, uh Peace out.
Yeah.
I always feel nervous at customs lines.
Even if I haven't done anything wrong, I still feel guilty.
I don't know why.
Don't worry, honey.
Wayne there's my friend.
We go way back.
Friend Wayne!
Where you going?
UhWayne!
Wayne!
Don't go away!
Where'd my Waynie just go?
UmI shouldn't be telling you this, he's being fired for accepting bribes.
Apparently he was letting people smuggle all kinds of stuff in the country-- emeralds, ivory, illegal prescription drugs.
What people will do!
Honey.
Uhsay, is this your 100?
No.
Must be mine.
Why don't you go ahead of me?
You look like you've had a hard life.
Ohthanks!
I've got to tell you I find these toilets that flush themselves very threatening.
That's nice, honey.
Listen, I've gotta pop over to the duty free and pick up a carton of cigs for the kids.
Would you be a peach and carry my bag?
- Oh, sure.
- Oh.
Ok.
- I mean, Josh is really-- - Grace, we've been through this already.
I'm telling you, Ben is the one you should be with.
Right, right.
Of course.
Besides, there's something about Josh I don't-- I can't put my finger on it.
But Will thinks I should dump Ben.
Why are you even listening to him?
I mean, Will's not thinking straight.
Ha ha.
You cannot have that much fat sucked out and function normally.
I'm telling you, Ben is the way to go.
You know what?
I think you're right.
It feels right.
You are so good at this.
Who's my good boy?
Who's my good boy?
!
So, what are you reading?
Ooh, he's cute.
"Texas to execute another inmate".
I do love them bad boys.
Well, you can read it later when I line your cage with it.
Ooh.
Barracuda.
What crawled up your culottes?
Nothing crawled up my culottes.
It's just that you're two inches from my ear polluting my brain with your inane ramblings and buzzing through those chips like some queer gopher.
All right, I get it.
I get it.
It's the surgery.
You know, Grace told me her mom was a little testy, too, after her first No, no, no.
I'm not testy.
What are you talking about?
Bobbi Adler never had a face-lift.
Uh, yes, she did.
Grace told me.
She told you her mom had a face-lift?
Yeah.
You didn't know that?
Of course I knew that.
I just didn't think it was something that she would tell you.
If you knew that, then why did you just say you didn't?
You know what?
Forget it.
Just take your crayons and go practice your lower-case letters.
Hey, don't go ridin' around on your huffy bike just because Grace tells me things she doesn't tell you.
Grace doesn't tell you anything.
AhSure, she does.
Yeah.
We spent a lot of time together while you were away, mister!
I bet you I know more about Grace than you do.
I am not gonna play that game with you.
What's her middle name?
That's easy.
It's I'm sorry.
It's what?
It'sja..
sam.
Did you say julia?
Ah, yes, I did.
Well, it's not.
It's Elizabeth.
Because her mother loves Elizabeth Taylor.
Well, whoop-de-damn-doo!
Doesn't say anything about who she is.
- Ok.
What was her saddest childhood moment?
- I don't know.
When she discovered that hamsters can't fly.
What was her nickname in junior high?
- I don't know.
- Gross Adler.
What was her first method of birth control?
- I don't know.
- Prayer.
- What does she want name her first daughter?
- Ha!
It's..
I don't know.
Lilly!
Ha ha!
Spelled with 2 Ls but still pronounced lily.
- Lilly.
- Yes!
It's her great-grandmother's name, it's her favorite flower, and we planted a whole box of them outside her bedroom window while you were away having three of your chins sucked out!
But you didn't know that, did you?
!
Ll-ll-ll-ll!
Pfft!
This is stupid.
Get away from me!
Aww!
So sad!
So pathétique.
Poor Will just found himself à pied de terre on la rue de la pathétique.
Your mother took the straps off your bed about 20 years too early.
How was it?
Oh, it was ok.
It was mostly business.
Stan gave me a monkey, though.
Heh heh.
Sweet little thing.
Bit of a biter.
Gave Rosario a nasty little ass hickey!
Ha ha ha ha!
Oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
You ok?
Uhyeah.
Ever since I've been back, I've been getting these shooting pains.
Well, have you done anything unusual since you've gotten home?
Eaten?
Loved?
Worked?
Well, let me see.
We landed.
We got our bags.
Rosario took the fall for some black pearls I was smuggling.
I went home, greeted the kids warmly over the intercom.
No.
Nothing out of the ordinary.
Rosario was arrested?
Yeah.
She's in a holding cell in Queens!
Ha ha ha ha-- Oh-oh-oh!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Wait!
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Because of something you did, Rosario was arrested?
Honey, who gives a crap about my maid?
My tummy hurts!
Have you noticed that every time I mention her name you grab your stomach?
What?
Whose name?
- Rosario.
- Ooh!
- Rosario.
- Ooh!
- Rosario.
- Ooh!
Knock it off!
What you're feeling are pangs of guilt.
What?
!
Guilt.
Oh, boy.
Ok.
How am I gonna explain this one?
Uhguilt is an emotion that-- Ok.
Jumping ahead.
An emotion is something that I-- Allons!
Come on!
I know what guilt is.
It's one of those touchy-feely words that people throw around that don't really mean anything You know, like "maternal" or "addiction".
Rosario.
Go get her out of jail!
I'm not going to Queens!
There are people living in cabs down there!
Let her tunnel her way out!
Ok.
Fine.
Don't get her.
I'm sure you'll find someone else who'll clean your house and love your kids and cream Stan's liver spots and Like a puppet on a string.
Hey, what are you doing?
All my plants died.
I told Jack to water them while I was away.
But I can see how he might hear that as "fill up my hard drive with Internet porn".
What's the matter?
Why are you pouting?
I'm not pouting.
Hey, I watch "Ally McBeal".
I know what pouting looks like.
You're pouting.
I heard you and Jack in your apartment last night.
What?
So now you're worried that Jack's my new you?
Ha!
I don't Maybe - Oh, my God.
Could you be any cuter?
- Grace!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just love not being the insecure wreck for once.
My feelings aren't cute, ok?
I'm not the youngest brother on "Eight is Enough".
How can you like Jack better than me?
Are kidding me with this?
We've been best friends for 15 years.
Do you really need me to tell you how much you mean to me?
I do it for you like every 5 minutes.
No, you don't!
Grace, I have to talk you off a ledge every time the Starbucks lady gives me extra foam!
Well, clearly there's something going on there.
I mean, the two of you have your own language.
Grace, it's called a macchiato.
All right.
What do you want me to say?
I don't know!
How about something like Like you need me more than anybody else There's no one that could ever take my place And then that, you know, you promise when your last breath escapes you in this earthly life, it will whisper my name.
Will.
But, you know, in your own words.
What does this say to you?
That you're out of Skin-So-Soft?
The scar, Will.
Remember?
Oh, right.
That's from when your sister was sleepwalking and thought you were a salami.
- That's on my thigh.
- Right.
No.
This scar is from junior year when Scott Kelly dumped you.
Remember?
I jumped on my moped, ran over to your dorm, hit a patch of ice, and flew into that stupid men's singing group.
Right.
The A Cappellicans.
God, they sucked.
The point is My love for you is like this scar Ugly but permanent.
So as long as this is on my elbow, you've got nothing to worry about.
Ok.
And you know what else?
Ow!
What?
!
What'd you do that for?
!
Don't you ever leave for the months without telling me.
Sorry.
Can I say one last thing about Josh?
I think you should reconsider.
I know he's not as exciting as Ben, but the man loves you.
Grace, I have to tell you something right away.
Hold on.
We're talking.
Josh is kind.
He's compassionate-- - All the things you've ever said were important to you.
- No, no, no.
You should break it off with Josh.
Jack, you know, Will has a point, so maybe I should just think about Josh a little more.
He doesn't.
You don't.
Dump him.
Jack, just because I say one thing doesn't mean you automatically have to take the contrary position.
This is about what's best for Grace, and I think-- - I screwed around with Josh.
- You should probably go with Ben.
What?
Yeah, well remember how I said there was something about Josh I couldn't put my finger on?
Well I Put my finger on it.
Sorry!
We had a saying on the Island.
Maka maka lana Lana makalui What does that mean?
I don't know.
I just can't believe you ended up with another gay guy!
Oh, honey, what an ordeal.
You should be down on your knees giving thanks to Saint Hootchy-Kootchy whatever coconut shell your people pray to that you didn't have to go through that!
And while you were busy yapping it up with the she-man of Cell Block H, I was doing double-time at the mans.
You know I actually had to read to the kids last night?
I didn't know what in hell to do, so I read 'em the warning label on my Dalmane!
Oh, God-- Oh, but listen to me goin' on like this.
It's terrible!
I haven't even given you a chance to thank me for springing you outta Oz!
Oh, honey, watch it!
My drink!
My drink!
My drink!
Honey!
Honey!
Honey, honey
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Will!
Open the door!
Will!
What's going on?
It better be a fire.
With really cute firemen.
Will, hurry up!
I'm Will by the way.
Mipanko.
And why wouldn't you be?
Aah!
Someone just tried to break into my apartment!
I was sleeping, and I heard the door jiggle, and then they tried to jam it open!
- There's someone out there!
- Oh, my god!
A-are you all right?
Nnno!
You stay here, and we'll-- we'll go check it out.
Jack, you may wanna grab something heavy.
I am so freaked out.
I cannot believe someone was trying to break into my apartment.
There's probably someone roaming the hallway with my picture in one hand and an axe in the other.
Oh, thank you.
That feels nice.
Who are you?
Mipanko.
Like the candy treat?
And don't worry, Jack has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do.
The Navy Seals, they train him for this sort of thing.
So, you two are pretty close, huh?
As close as two men can get in 11 minutes.
Somebody was definitely trying to get in.
The doorjamb was messed with.
Yeah, but the ball cock is ok.
What?
Why did you check the toilet?
I didn't.
I just like saying it.
Heh heh All right, well, there's nothing we can do tonight.
So, you wanna-- wanna stay here?
No.
No, I'm not going to be chased out of my own apartment.
Then they'll have won.
I'm gonna be strong.
Will you sleep over with me tonight?
Please!
Please, please, please-- Why do I only get these offers from women?
Ok, all right, all right, all right!
Thank you!
Who's my hero?
Who's my big strong man?
I don't know.
We'll stay over till he shows up.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 02 Fear and Clothing synchro by kingo Will?
Are you asleep?
You kidding?
Between the mouth-breathing, and the wheezing, and the sinuses, it's like sleeping with a Sleestak.
This breathe-easy strip doesn't work.
- Ow!
!
- Ow!
!
- What?
- Could we talk about your toenails?
I'm sorry.
I'll cut them.
Don't you need them for tree climbing and warding off predators?
Shh!
Listen!
Listen!
What's that?
!
I just heard someone outside!
You heard nothing!
There's nothing out there, so just-- Oh, my God!
- See!
- Don't freak out!
- I have never freaked out!
- Shh!
Shh!
Stay here.
Nothing.
It's nothing.
We're fine.
Did I just scream like a woman?
Don't flatter yourself.
You scream like a girl.
Will, if there had been someone out there, what would we have done?
I don't know.
Grate some cheese with your toenails and invite them in for quiche?
Come on, let's go back to bed.
What?
No, no!
- I can't sleep here.
- Oh!
No, I'm too creeped out.
No, I--I don't-- I don't feel-- I don't feel good here anymore.
All right, we'll go to my apartment.
It'd make more sense, anyway.
At least this way, we'll get some peace and quiet.
Biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, biggly, bog!
- I win!
- Damn!
Every time!
- What are you doing?
- Playing Biggly Bog!
Biggly what?
Bog.
It's like Taggly Dip, but with dice.
Look, Grace can't sleep over there, so we're gonna stay-- Why is Mipanko wearing my kimono?
Blanche, I think the bigger question is, why do you have a kimono?
And how many times have I told you to keep your animals in your room, doctor do-nothing?
Shh-shh-shh!
Just keep it down.
You'll wake up Poppy.
Who's Poppy?
Mipanko's Poppy, Will.
He showed up here in tears.
Poppy got in a fight with his parents.
It's ok, Poppy.
We'll be quiet.
Ok.
And we close the mouth.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- MRNG.
- Morning.
Can you imagine if whoever it was had actually gotten in?
He probably would've made me rub lotion all over myself so he could make a prairie skirt out of my skin.
Karen, I have never been more terrified in my entire life.
Oh, honey.
Stan bought me a 7-karat ruby on our trip to Paris last year.
What does that have to do with the break-in?
Nothing, honey.
I thought we were just swapping stories.
Jeez Louise!
Didn't realize it was "All about Grace" day.
Oh, there it is.
Miss Karen, they were out of Grey Goose, so I got you extra Stoli.
Ooh!
What's going on here?
This doesn't concern you.
I'm turning the fridge into a minibar.
So what did you bring me, Rosiola?
Oh, all your boys are here.
Johnnie Walker, Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo, and the 2 Glens, Livet and Fiddich.
I think I'm gonna give the boys a shimmy.
Whoo!
Oh yeaah!
Hey, boys!
Karen, Karen No.
No, no, no, no.
No, this is not a hotel.
We work here.
You cannot have a minibar.
Where should I put the giant Kit-Kats?
Stick them in the minibar.
I've had it, Grace!
If you leave the toilet seat down one more time-- Are you two still fighting?
What is she doing here?
It's 9:45.
Shouldn't she be at lunch?
What is she doing here?
Shouldn't she be at the Westside Y bobbing for boyfriends?
- Why are you still doing this?
- Hey hey hey!
I did her a favor by marrying her maid.
And what do I get in return?
Nothing!
She is dead to me!
Nobody tries to soak Karen Walker for half a mil and my bustier collection!
She is dead to me, too!
You know, this is my office.
I had to have Rosario deloused after being married to it!
Hello, I'm in the room!
Enough!
Stop!
Not another word from any of you!
Suck it-- Ok, enough!
All of you, just go off to your corners and just-- be strange!
Now!
Ahem.
Rhymes with witch.
I am sorry, but I am just not in the mood to play mediator.
I am having the hardest time just feeling safe in my own home.
Why?
What happened?
What are-- What are you doing?
It's "Behind the Music" with Mariah Scarey.
I am right in the middle of "Rumpole of the Bailey".
Don't just grab the remote!
I'm sorry.
It was very wrong of me.
What?
!
Where did you get that?
Ooh, look!
This is the part where Mariah pretends not to hate Whitney.
Give me that!
We are going to watch "Rumpole of the Bailey".
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
They're reattaching a woman's scalp on The Learning Channel!
Put it on!
Sorry, Grace.
Will's watching "Bunghole up my Mainly".
It is "Rumpole of the Bailey," and seeing as I have the remotes, that's what we're watching.
Grace!
Wha You've seen this thing, like, 5 times.
I know, but it's hard to watch the whole thing.
Each time I watch, I see a little-- Whoa!
No, no!
We are watching this!
- Mariah!
- Rumpole.
No, no!
Just leave it alone!
Cut it out already!
Wait, what happened?
Why is it on "Highway to Heaven"?
You broke it!
Now it's stuck on Pax TV.
That's it!
Get out here, both of you!
Come on, out!
I can't sleep.
Y-you've eaten all my food.
There's so much hair at the bottom of the bathtub, I swear it's about to ask me if I want a falafel.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.
I love you both, and I want to help you, but I'm afraid one of you is gonna have to go.
Whoa, Cassidy, Cody, enough!
I know, I know!
You're scared of your apartment, and you're a homo without a home.
I know!
They're very good arguments, a-and trust me, this is not a decision I'm eager to make, so-- So you make it.
Kumquat?
You decide who's going to stay and who's going to go.
- I'll be back in an hour.
- Where are you going?
Where every red-blooded American man goes when he needs to blow off steam The sweater department at Bergdorf's.
Scissors!
Scissors!
Scissors!
Scissors!
Stop doing that!
It doesn't work if you do the same thing!
- Then stop doing scissors!
- You stop doing scissors!
- Fine!
- Fine!
Again.
Scissors!
Scissors!
Scissors!
Scissors!
You suck at this!
Listen, this is no way to decide who's going to stay in this apartment.
Let's just be fair.
Let's be reasonable.
I'm thinking of a number between one and 10.
Do you have no respect for me?
I'm not gonna play that stupid game.
- Just pick a number!
- Five.
Damn it!
You were wrong.
Jack, for once in your life, would you stop being so selfish?
!
I was robbed!
My apartment still feels creepy!
Oh, shut up, Adler!
Your apartment was creepy before you were robbed!
You just wanna stay here because this place doesn't smell like bologna and mulch.
Well, you're nothing but a leech, McFarland!
You just glom on to someone like Karen or Will, and you leech, and you mooch, - and you leech, and you mooch, and you leech-- - Scaredy-cat!
- Parasite!
- Overbite!
Underdeveloped calves!
Here you go.
I'm here to pick up Stanley Walker's suit.
Karen, it's meWill.
Oh!
Hi, Wilma.
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you!
Silly me.
So, could you grab me that suit?
I'm kind of in a hurry.
Karen, I don't work here.
I'm-- Actually, you know what?
I'm on my break right now, but the other salesguy'll be back in just a minute.
- So, how you doing?
- All right.
Just doing a little shopping while Grace and Jack-- Buh-buh-buh-buh!
Do not say that name to me!
He is dead to me!
And that one goes to the bottom of the pile.
I can't believe you're still mad at him.
I clothed and fed that man for a year, and he tried to fleece me.
And he didn't even have the decency to put me into an insulin-induced coma first.
Are you actually surprised that Jack McFarland took advantage of you?
I mean, that's like being surprised when the counter help at yogurt shop seems sad for no reason.
Come on, this is Jack we're talking about.
Go on, salesperson Jack is like a-- a puppy.
You don't stop loving him because he piddles on the carpet.
You just roll up a newspaper and hit him on the snoots.
He does have that sweet puppy breath.
Yeah.
And we both know how much he loves chasing that tail.
Here you go.
Thanks.
I'm really glad we worked things out, Grace.
Yeah, me, too.
Sorry I bitch-slapped you.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, so guess what?
We've come to a decision.
Well, good.
I figured if I just got out of your way, you'd do the right thing.
So, what did you decide?
I'm in, Red's out.
Well, ok, that's good, that's--that's fine.
And you're ok with this?
Yeah, I'm gonna have my Aunt Pescha come over and get rid of the evil spirits.
Then of course, the problem becomes getting rid of my Aunt Pescha, bu-- And if that doesn't work, then I'll just find another place to live.
I mean, we really talked about it, and--and he really does need this more than I do, so-- Plus you lost three straight rounds of thumb wrestling.
Ok, not necessary.
- So I'm gonna get going.
- Yeah.
Hey, Will, you know, can you run out and get me some bee pollen extract for my tea?
Yeah, it's a little dullsville.
Hold that thought.
Just wanna try a little experiment.
You sit there with that.
And you come here.
Yes, much better, much better!
W-what's going on?
I thought you wanted us to make the choice?
I did.
I just didn't think you'd pick the wrong choice.
May I remind you that I'm your one remaining link to the gay world.
Jack, I love you.
I'm sorry, but-- For the sake of our friendship, I can't live with you.
So you're shutting me out?
Is that-- Is that wh-- Mmm, yeah, that tastes good, yeah.
All right, fine.
You know what?
If you need me, I'll be out on the street sleeping in a hat, tissue boxes for shoes, selling figurines of kittens made from scraps of metal and old soup.
Hey, Eponine What I had in mind was you sublet Grace's apartment.
Or technically, your mom and I sublet Grace's apartment.
What do you think?
Works for me.
Yeah, you'd like that, I'm sure.
Yeah, right.
Yeah!
There's 9 months left on my lease.
Wouldn't you like it?
Yeah, ok, Grace!
Oh, my God, I have my own apartment!
All it needs is a little gay spray and a half-dozen torso sculptures, and I'm home!
Let's go tell everybody!
Exeunt flourish!
- So.
- Yeah.
So we're living together again.
Yes, we are.
You sure about this?
Sweetie I have never been less sure about anything in my life.
Oh, thank God!
Me, too!
- Oh!
Hey, poodle!
- Hello.
Guess what?
Good news.
We're not mad at each other anymore, because I've forgiven you.
Interesting, because I haven't forgiven you.
So what's your point?
Oh, all right, I'm sorry.
There, we're done.
Come on, let's go get French tips.
Karen, I am not a light switch that you can just apologize to and expect me to forgive you.
My emotions are much more complex than that I need time to heal.
I don't accept.
- You don't what?
- I said I don't accept.
I don't think you understand what just happened here.
The only other person I've ever apologized to was my mother, and that was court ordered.
So please accept my apology in the spirit in which it was intended or I'll kick you in the gittles.
No!
Now be gone before someone drops a house on you!
Hey, up yours, Dorothy.
May you tan and freckle!
Don't mind me.
I'm just grabbing my toothbrush and a Balance Bar.
Ow!
Hey, that looked like it hurt.
Yeah, tell me about it!
She could be bleeding.
That's not funny.
You wanna know something else that's not funny?
You know, um, yesterday she slipped on some bacon grease in the kitchen, and she missed the counter-top by this much.
She could have lost an eye!
Last night, Olivia shoved Butler down the service stairwell, knocked him unconscious!
- When did you find him?
- Not till this morning!
He might need a brace!
Oh, Kar, I missed you!
Oh, I missed you, too, honey.
Wink, wink!
I felt so bad, I went out and bought this.
- Oh, for me?
- No.
But we can go buy you a little happy.
Come on, let's go to Bergdorf's.
- Say, did you know Will works there now?
- Get out!
and that concludes the "Highway to Heaven" Marathon.
Stay tuned for the "Making of the Highway to Heaven Marathon.
That was good.
Night, Poppy.
And
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Oh!
You see, she's not listening to her caddy.
He told her the green was fast.
I wish I had a caddy.
Somebody who'd tell me about the hazards up ahead and carry my stuff.
I think I'm your caddy.
Oh, yeah!
Now go get me a Fruitopia and my 9 iron.
- No, I'm serious.
I'm thirsty, move your ass.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Don't get catty with the caddy.
Big news!
Joe and Larry have invited us to the South Hamptons for a man-tan reunion.
Joe and Larry?
You're kidding.
- No, it's gonna be wild!
- Oh, my God!
You remember their last party?
Yeah.
I got so drunk, all I remember is-- making out with some guy in the hot tub.
Oh, my God, so did I!
- I don't really remember that.
- I don't.
Anyways, I'm so excited!
Gosh, it's been so many years.
I hope I can pull off a thong.
Isn't the point of these weekends to pull off someone else's?
No, Grace, you can't come.
I'm sorry, loving you to Della Reese's pieces, but gay guys only.
Remind me to invite Karen.
That's fine.
As much as I would love a couple of days of lube and Liza-- Iam going to Ben's yacht club this weekend.
Wow.
The black man is taking the Jewish girl to the Yacht Club.
You two are so out, you're in.
Bring me a souvenir.
Actually, ew!
Don't!
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 3 Husbands and Trophy Wives synchro: kingo - Ooh-Ooh!
- I can't hear you!
Ooh-Ooh!
We're here, we're queer Give us a light beer!
We're here, we're queer - Give us a light beer!
- Shh!
Hey, quiet!
Hi!
Good to see you!
Why, uh, why are we whispering?
Yeah, if we don't, will we be disciplined?
No, no, no.
I think you got the wrong idea.
Hey, guys!
Captain Hornblower!
Hello I'm not quite getting the theme of this party.
Hi, guys, great to see you.
I'd kiss, but it's flu season.
This is Hannah.
She's our little pudding.
Something tells me the, uh, the baby oil is actually going to be used on babies this year.
So, first time at a yacht club, huh?
I'm guessing you're pretty impressed with me right now.
So am I!
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat cleaned up, showered, exfoliated, powdered, lipsticked, Gucci'd and dragged in.
Karen Walker.
You know, I thought I saw a waiter out front weeping.
Now it all makes sense.
Oh, honey, look at you in a yacht club.
It's weird.
It's--it's kind of like seeing-- you in a yacht club.
Well, you might want to get used to it, Karen darling, 'cause you'll be seeing a lot more of me around here, a-hoo-hoo-ha!
Are you all right, baby?
So, I, uh, I noticed they redid the floors in the bridge room touch me.
What did you say?
What?
Nothing.
What did you think I just said fondle me.
Mrs. Walker, you're not fooling anyone.
What, I'm not trying to fool anyone take me.
That's not even subtle.
What?
What isn't?
"Touch me, fondle me, take me".
Well, well.
Aren't you a dirty bird?
But all right!
I think I'll go say hello to your husband.
You remember him, the one you married in sickness and in wealth?
I'll be right back, baby.
Mm-mmm!
I love to watch him go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"Ben's so cute!
Ben's so sexy!
Ben's so big"!
I didn't say that.
Oh.
Well, just get to work!
We're not at work.
Well, then quit yapping about your boyfriend and file something!
Give me a drink.
Why are you being-- Ohh!
Oh my God!
You're jealous!
Wh--?
!
What?
!
You are!
You're jealous of my hot black lover!
You know what?
You can be really mean sometimes.
I'm mean?
!
You introduce me to your friends as "Bozo Adler".
Karen-- She's right, you know.
Whoa!
Rosario, what are you doing here?
Mr. Stan forgot his evening toupee.
And shame on you.
Oh, for what?
Oh, come on, I was just having some fun.
You know how rare it is I find something good like that to flaunt in her face.
Well, your timing sucks, Bozo.
Please don't call me Bozo.
Look, I'm gonna tell you something, and if you repeat it, I'm gonna wash your mouth out with toilet cleanser.
You're lovely.
In a week, Miss Karen will be the same age as Mr. Stan's first wife - when he cut her loose.
- So?
Do I have to spell it out for you?
She's plagued by feelings of insecurity, wondering if she's still attractive to men.
I'm hooked on "The View".
Karen?
I don't believe it.
I'm telling you, she's not herself.
The other day, I saw her put milk in her cereal.
Instead of Bailey's?
It's not funny when you know the truth.
Well, it's less funny.
Oh, poor Karen, I feel awful.
I'm gonna go talk to her.
Well, since you're sharing.
How old is Karen?
Come close.
Closer.
Ow, ow, ow!
If you value your life, you'll never ask that again, Bozo!
See you later, guys.
Bye, Scotty.
I know every parent says this, but Hannah really is superior to all the other kids.
I mean, you saw the envy in that other baby's eyes.
So, wow.
What's it like being fathers?
I mean, is it amazing?
Well, it-it's totally changed our lives.
I haven't slept in 8 months, I've completely lost my figure, but I have what I've always dreamed of A family.
Yeah, that's neat.
Hey, fellas, look.
J'adore you, ok?
Je can't get enough of you.
But, um, it's tough love time.
And I know I speak for Will when I say we're very disappointed.
This whole baby thing makes you guys losers.
What?
!
It does not-- I don't feel that way.
I-- That is completely wrong, and don't ever speak for me.
Notice that he did not say I was wrong.
Yes, I did, that's exactly what I said.
I rest my case.
Well, how about resting your pie-hole?
I--I think what you guys are doing is very cool.
- I can't wait to be a father.
- You'd be a great dad, Will.
Yeah, you know, I always thought I would.
Yeah, I totally want this.
I just have to find the right guy and the right uterus.
Hopefully not in the same person.
I don't get it.
I mean, personally I think you should've gotten a bird.
They're much more colorful, and you don't get social workers breathing down your neck every time you lock them in a cage at night.
Ooh, wrong crowd.
You know how you get to that place in your life when the endless parties and the up-all-night and the drinking and the casual sex just don't do it for you anymore?
I'm not following.
I'm sure this is all boring for you.
Tell us what fabulous things you guys have been up to.
Oh.
Uh, well, we, um We have put together a time capsule.
Actually, it's--it's more of a junk drawer, but it's so nice to have everything right there and organized.
Oh, and--and we still have our Friday night movie club.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we sit in the back row, and every time straight people kiss, we hiss.
Oh.
Do you know how long it's been since we've been to a movie?
Well, here's an idea.
I mean, seeing as we're obviously not gonna be doing Jell-O shots and playing pin the tail on the donkey-- - How is the donkey, by the way?
- Oh, good.
Good.
His oldest is starting pre-K.
Why don't you two go to a movie, and we'll stay here with Hannah?
Woman!
Have you lost your mind as well as your looks?
I ain't baby-sittin'!
- I'll pay you.
- I wouldn't do it for $100.
- How 'bout 50?
- Fine.
Guys, if you hurry you can catch the 7:00 show.
- What do you think?
- Can we do that?
I mean, she's just gonna be sleeping anyway.
Exactly.
Of course you are, aren't you, Hannah?
You'd be happy to have me take care of you, wouldn't you?
Hmm?
What's that?
Oh, no, sweetheart.
That's not the tooth fairy.
No.
This fairy doesn't have a job.
Ah, Smitty.
Why is there so much pain in the world?
So much cruelty?
Can you tell me that, Smitty?
My name is not Smitty.
I don't need your life story, nose hair.
Just fill her up.
Hey, Karen.
I just wanted to say sorry about before.
- You know, you look great tonight.
- Yeah, yeah.
No, I mean really great.
Listen, I was sitting across the room.
And I saw you, and you took my breath away.
- What?
- Yeah.
I mean, you are such a sexy, beautiful, vibrant woman.
Anyone would be so lucky to have you.
Are you hitting on me?
Wh-- What?
No!
Where do you g-- You are!
Oh, my god.
You're a big lez.
Karen-- You know, people have always said you were, but I said, "No.
That's just the way she walks".
I have a sturdy gait.
Honey, come on.
Finally, an explanation for the chunky shoes and all the keys.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
See-- Look.
Look.
Um, Karen I just sensed that you were feeling a little down.
and I just wanted to make sure that you know how attractive you are.
Hey, back off, Lezzy Borden.
No means no.
Come on, little Hannah.
Time for bed.
Time for sleep.
Say good night.
Say good night to Uncle Will and Auntie Jack.
Close your eyes.
Come on.
I don't know-- She's not even tired.
Hey, sister go, sister soul, sister go, sister-- Jack.
That's not gonna work.
- Hey sister go, sister soul, sister soul, sister.
- Jack, come on He met Marmalade down in old New Orleans, struttin' her stuff on the street.
She said- Hello, hey, Joe you wanna give it a go?
Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya ya ya.
Gitchi, gitchi, ya ya yee.
Mocca chocalata, ya ya.
Creole Lady Mamalo.
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?
- Voulez-vous coucher avec-- - Jack.
Jack.
Jack.
- She's asleep.
- I was just getting to the best part of the song.
It doesn't matter because she's asleep.
She's cute.
Cute?
She's heaven.
This is really what it's about, you know?
And it doesn't seem that hard.
I mean, what do they do?
They eat.
They sleep.
They poop.
God, I'd kill for that life.
You have that life.
I want this, you know?
I I got to kiss that little puddin's cheeks.
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.
Want to go for a ride on my boat?
Oh!
Oh, oh, you know, this isn't the time.
No.
I mean my actual boat.
It's docked in the harbor.
Oh.
Maybe later.
Look.
- I need you to do something for me.
- Anything, baby.
I need you to hit on Karen.
Please tell me you said: "I need you to put a hit on Karen".
Damn it, Jack.
You promised you would help me burp her.
Will, I don't know nothin' about burpin' no babies.
Now get off my back.
- I thought we were in this together.
- No.
This is what you wanted.
I never wanted this baby to begin with.
I want my life back.
Well, guess what?
She's here, and we can't send her back.
- So how about a little help?
- You don't want my help.
I told you to do what my mother did to me when I was crying.
Jack, I am not gonna leave this child in a laundromat.
Well, then leave me at one because I'm a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
God, you're worthless.
And don't think I'm gonna forget how you've been tonight.
- You are unreliable, irresponsible-- - Oh, shut up, Will!
You're just freaked out 'cause you stink at this.
- Excuse me?
- You suck at being a dad, and you're taking it out on me.
I'm gonna go see if she needs changing.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.
- How'd it go?
- Well, I gave her some of my best stuff.
I gave her the lean in.
I gave her the soft touch.
I flashed her these.
And then I finished off by giving her a little of the 20/20 hindsight.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you did a good thing.
I appreciate it.
Now, where is that boat you keep talking about?
Mr. Doucette.
May I have a word with you, please?
Uh, I'm in the middle of a conversation here.
It's a rather pressing matter.
I'll be back in a minute, baby.
Hi, Ben.
Hi, honey.
- You seem happy.
- Oh, yeah, I am.
Listen, Grace.
I just-- I want you to know that I know everything you tried to do for me.
Are you feeling better?
Yeah, I am, but that's not why.
Sweet story.
Ben's being kicked out of the club.
- What?
!
- Oh, it's so romantic.
Oh.
Stan saw him hitting on me, and he got so jealous, he threw his ass out.
Oh, Stan loves me, Grace.
I am walking on air.
Yeah.
I may give the little admiral a salute tonight.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.
This was not the way it was supposed to go.
Oh, it never does, honey.
Ooh, speaking of which, you better pack it up, too.
They're not crazy about the lesbians.
Ooh, hello, hottie in the Honda.
Great scar!
Oh!
Speed up.
Come on.
Speed, speed up.
Uh.
Oh, great.
He's gone.
Was gonna spend the rest of my life with him.
What, what?
Why do you hate me so much?
I don't hate you.
I'm not even mad at you.
Then why have you been oozing hostility ever since we dropped Sad Doll back off with her parents?
I'm upset about what you said earlier.
- About your big old boobs?
- No.
- About you being boney?
- No.
- About your hair plugs?
- I don't have hair plugs.
I hate that I couldn't take care of one little kid.
You're right.
I'd suck as a dad.
Uh, I just said that to upset you.
I didn't mean it.
Whether you meant it or not, it's true.
If I can't take care of a kid for one night, how am I gonna do it when it's for real?
I always just assumed I'd be a great dad.
I never doubted it.
No I What are you talking about?
You just did the soccer mom arm save.
- So?
- So you have the instinct.
That's not the instinct of a dad.
That's the instinct of a guy who didn't take out insurance on his passenger.
Will, you're gonna be an awesome dad.
You're caring.
You're thoughtful.
You're generous.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
No, I'm not.
I mean, what would I get out of that?
You're gonna be a great dad because for the last 10 years, you've been a great one to me.
- Wanna stop for ice cream?
- Nah.
Wanna go to a bar and look at hot guys?
I love you, daddy.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
And then I'll close with something like "And let this be the dawning of a new era, a good feeling between the police department and the gay community".
And then applause, applause, applause, and then I guess there'll be a Q & A. Ok, I've got a "Q".
Why am I bored off my "A"?
I don't know, but why are you being such a "B"?
Sweetie, it's too dry.
Why don't you do a skit or something?
A skit?
Grace, this is a gay sensitivity seminar.
I'm not gonna do some stupid skit in front of a room full of cops.
What is this, "The Electric Company"?
- You can call it a "dramatization".
- Ooh, I like the dramatization.
Yeah, it could be, like, four gay guys that are in a car and a cop pulls them over.
Ooh ooh.
And then he strip searches them and takes them all downtown.
What?
!
Ok, clean up your area.
My, uh, my intern's starting today.
Oh, no.
No!
Grace, you do not want an intern.
Believe me.
We had this guy at our office-- Brad.
Totally useless.
Always hanging around, just being annoying.
- So he said "no" when you asked him out?
- Oh.
Did I tell you this story already?
Besides, Gillian is nothing like that.
We had such a great phone conversation.
She's just this cool, smart, enthusiastic design student.
She reminds me of a young me.
- Why, because she has a wide nose and brown hair?
- I did not have a nose job!
I'm kidding.
Darling, don't you know I'm engaging in a little bit of levity.
Don't do British.
- You told me you liked it.
- You seemed needy that day.
I was just trying to make you feel good.
Anyway, I'm-- I'm just so excited about having her here.
I don't know what it is about her, but she just has this quality I really respond to.
- Oh, my God.
You're Grace Adler.
Hi.
I'm Gillian.
- Hi.
Ok.
Let me just get this dorky stuff out of the way, ok?
I love you.
I love your work.
I love you and your work.
Ok, now I can be my regular hip self.
I love you.
I love your work.
I love you and your work.
No.
I can't imagine why you like her.
I'm sorry.
I don't know you, but you should never do British.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 4 Girl Trouble W-what I'm trying to do I-I-is dramatize the problems faced by the gay community when they're dealing with the police.
A-and I-I worked very hard on this, Jack, - so please, when you pass judgment-- - I can't do this crap!
It's garbage!
Do you hear me?
Garbage!
Put it in a cinch sack, throw it on a barge Garbage!
Capital G!
Arbage!
Well, coming from trash, I consider that high praise indeed.
Will, there's no character, there's no heart.
The part is unplayable, Will!
Unplayable!
Alright, I'll just have to get somebody else to parade around in front of 50 of New York's finest.
Look, I'm not saying I can't make it work.
Well, I guess I can put aside my problems with the material.
After all, if we can help even one person be more sensitive to gay issues-- Billie Jean King!
There are lezzies in this!
Martina Navratilova, yes, there are.
Oh, I beg of you, Will.
Please let them be played by men.
No one will ever know the difference.
That's what Shakespeare did when he had lesbos in his scripts.
Yes.
Who could forget the coven of high school gym teachers in MacBeth.
Since when did you become so narrow-minded?
Hey, there's not a single part of me that is anti-lesbian.
Well, maybe one But, trust me.
This is something I really want to do.
Who's playing the parts?
- Our friends from the kite shop, Terry and Annie.
- Starsky and Butch?
!
They hate me!
Really?
Even after you gave them such affectionate pet names?
That's them.
Be nice.
When am I not nice?
Why are you wearing a blouse?
Let them in.
- Hi.
- Hey.
We didn't know the appropriate gift for a gay sensitivity seminar training rehearsal.
So, we brought a cactus.
I believe that is the traditional gift.
- Just don't sit on it.
- Hah!
Even as a game.
This is really good.
What is this?
You know, just some sketches I did for my ex-boyfriend's place.
It's really good.
Your ex is gonna love it.
Ok, but why all the mirrors?
I want him to see his chubby cheating ass from all angles.
Why don't you take another pass at it before you turn it in?
Ok, I will.
Hey, uh, do you mind if I just hang around and watch you work?
I mean, I'd love to get a sense of what your process is.
Oh.
Sure.
Ok.
Oh.
Hello, Is Mr. Sanderson there, please?
- You sure you don't want to be alone?
- No, it's ok, you can listen.
Mr. Sanderson, Grace Adler.
Hi.
Tell me, what's your soup today?
Manhattan or New England?
Eww.
- It was Manhattan.
- Eww.
I know.
Ok, I'm going to grab the fabric board for the Flebotte house.
You wanna help me with it?
Well, sure.
But, I mean, you know I'm just gonna tell you that you're brilliant and shouldn't change a thing.
Well, that's the help I'm looking for.
Grace, I thought we talked about the beret.
Patty Hearst couldn't even pull one off, and she had money and a gun.
Oh, my God!
What's going on?
Now there are four of you!
Um, hi.
Hi, I'm Gillian.
It's nice to meet you.
Are you a designer, too?
What's going on?
What's happening?
Why is it talking to me?
Karen, this is-- This is Gillian.
Remember?
Our intern from Cooper Union, first in her class?
She's gonna be here for two weeks.
Uhh not ringing a bell.
Could you give me a hint?
I don't need to give you a hint.
She's standing right here.
Hello?
Ok.
Rule number one-- Unless you're served in a frosted glass, never come within four feet of my lips.
- Should we be scared?
- Oh, no.
Ha ha.
But, uh, let me move you over here, in the unlikely event she unhinges her jaw and swallows you whole.
"So, officer, I hope you understand.
We just want to be treated the same as anybody.
- No better, No worse.
- I understand.
I learned a valuable lesson today.
Everyone deserves to be treated with a little respect.
- Even mean lesbian kite sellers".
- Oh, that's--!
You are this close to losing your post rehearsal yogurt.
- That's the line, that's what's written here.
- Yeah, that's because you wrote it.
In lip liner!
At least one of us brought some.
- I don't think that's funny.
- Why?
'Cause Ellen DeGeneres didn't say it?
All right!
We're going!
Will, we're sorry, but this guy is an idiot.
Smart enough to sleep with men!
Please, Please, don't go yet.
Let me talk to him, please?
I beg you.
I don't-- I don't know where to start.
Neither do I. The wide one is giving me nothing.
You are, as of now, the most offensive person in this building.
And I'm including Mr. Open Robe with his itchy bits on the tenth floor.
- Name one thing I did wrong.
- Wha-- One thing?
Ok, let's see.
You haven't once called them by their names, preferring instead to address them as "mister" or "señor".
You've mooed, you've sung the Lumberjack Song.
And then you told some joke about the Indigo Girls and a Mexican restaurant that I still don't understand.
I could try to appeal to you as a thoughtful gay man, but, ironically, that would be fruitless.
Let me take a different tactic.
I'm going to challenge you as an actor.
Jean Valjean?
You're taking my art seriously?
I want you to try and play a man who is not offensive to lesbians.
It will be my greatest acting challenge to date.
But I believe I can do it.
Let me try.
Here's my back story.
Maybe-- Maybe I'm a lesbian-loving international financier with a scar on the left side of my face.
Maybe Maybe I drive a Hummer that's always in the shop.
Maybe Maybe I dress entirely to the left.
Maybe you had a stroke.
Maybe I have.
I can do this.
Ladies, shall we take it from the top?
Ok, but just so you know, one more remark and we walk.
I understand.
Please forgive me for my rudeness earlier.
But you see, I recently got a bad Hummer.
Ok, now put your sketchbook away 'cause I've got a little surprise for you.
Today is the day we learn about upholstered walls.
"What's that"?
You say.
"Upholstered walls?
That's madness!
It can't be done"!
Oh, but it can.
Cool.
Cool.
So, hey, when's Karen getting in?
Oh, we've learned not to ask that question.
It just sets you up for disappointment, especially when she does come in.
What's her deal?
Like, where is she from?
AhhI think she just appeared fully formed under a moist stone.
- I mean, She's a real trip, isn't she?
- Well, she's usually on one.
She sends me to the coolest places, right?
I mean, like yesterday.
She sent me to Tiffany's and Barney's.
She even sent me to the dog groomer to get the gray out of her poodle.
They couldn't because, well, it's a gray poodle.
I'm sorry.
She shouldn't have you running errands.
No, no.
It was great.
I mean, the moment I mentioned her name at Barney's, people just started kissing my ass.
I got a glass of champagne, a personal shopper, and a Percocet.
It was awesome!
You should see what happens when you mention my name at The Rug Barn.
You get a glass of cold mint tea and a rough kiss from a guy named Misha.
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.
I've been runnin' all over town, but I promise you it was work-related.
You were shopping.
How is that work-related?
Honey, I was avoiding work.
I mean, really, sometimes I just-- You're not Hey, Karen, so what'd you get?
Oh, I got this coat.
Oh, I'm over it.
Hey, Gillian, I wasn't going to show just yet, but my idea for a bathroom-- Moroccan meets rubber.
"What?
!
Ok, now you've gone too far, missy"!
- Honey, you want this?
- What?
Oh, my God, could I?
Wow.
That is so soft.
I know.
It's made out of kittens.
Ha ha!
That's so fabulous.
Thank you so much.
Honey, could you get that?
I'm so sorry my intern didn't show up yet.
I'm sure she'll be there any second.
Anyway, I'm so glad that you loved the cork floors.
I knew you would.
They're so versatile.
They're so durable.
Just a few things: Don't walk on them, No heavy furniture, Don't let sun get on them, and as far as having kids, I'd hold off for at least 5 years.
Enjoy.
Honey, that was the best lunch I've had in years.
- Oh, honey, me, too.
- Honey, you didn't eat a thing.
Honey, I was talking about the olives.
Gillian, nice of you to put in an appearance.
I was just filling out your evaluation.
What do you think I should put down for punctuality?
I was going to put down a check, but now I think I'm going to have to change that to a check-minus.
Ok, I have a good excuse.
Karen and I drank a long lunch at the Four Seasons.
Gillian, just get-- just get to work.
Oh, honey, no.
I have an appointment at Yolanda's for a spirulina masque.
Oh, and by the way, that color doesn't even look good an orange, ok?
Kisses all around!
I like her spunk.
Very professional.
Karen, I'm really not interested in talking to you right now.
I've a lot of work to do.
- Ok.
- So could you stop talking?
What!
Wait Where's my Croissandwich?
Karen?
Karen!
- Honey, you told me not to-- - Where is my ham and cheese Croissandwich?
!
That thing in the bag?
Honey, I thought that was trash.
I threw it away.
- You threw it away?
!
- It was starting to crawl for the door.
Oh!
Great!
Great!
Why don't you just throw everything in my life away?
!
"Hi.
I'm Karen Walker.
I'm throwing everything away.
I don't know what it is.
It doesn't fit into my life.
I'm throwing it away".
- Honey, you want another Crois-- - They only serve them till 11:00!
This whole day is ruined.
This whole week is ruined.
Now my business is probably going to go under, and it's all your fault.
- What?
- And you have a pore on your nose you could serve dip out of.
I just wanna tell you.
I think you're doing great with Terry and Annie.
I do what I do, for I am what I am.
What's with the voice?
I was trying to find my character and I came up with this voice.
Well, Angela Lansbury wants it back.
You're playing a cop.
Talk normal.
You might as well just ask me to throw out my whole character.
Yeah.
Good.
Throw it out.
Alright, let's get started.
Everybody take your seats.
Ok, welcome to the Caribbean sensivity seminar.
- Uh, actually, officer, we're, uh - Oh, yeah, right.
Sorry.
Today we're doin' the gays.
Let's, uh, give 'em a warm welcome.
Thank you-- Ahem-- Very much.
We'd like to start with a dramatization based on an actual complaint lodged against the police department.
I think this will illustrate the kind of insensitivity that our community's concerned about.
Before we begin, I would ask that you refrain from the taking of flash photography as the lesbians may attack you.
- Oh, that's it!
- We're outta here!
Oh, Annie!
Terry!
- Jack!
- What?
- How could you?
!
- You're the one who told me to abandon my character-- The lesbian-loving gay financier with a Hummer in the shop.
I just asked you to abandon that queer voice.
"Queer"?
Who you callin' queer, you blouse-wearin' fairy?
This from the homo who minces around the gym in a lycra onesie.
- Grace wears one.
- She's a woman, you girl!
- Don't call me a girl!
Eyebrow-plucker!
- Leg-waxer!
- Lady!
- Tramp!
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, honey.
Honey, sit down.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's this all about?
I've got something tough to tell you.
Uh, I'm fabulous, ok?
I'm an incredible dresser, I've got buckets of money, I'm a hoot and a half, and I got a killer rack.
Do you get what I'm saying?
Uh, not really.
Honey, you're not me, and you never will be.
Is it the rack?
No But it's a big part of it.
Now, you're never going to be me, but you've got a good chance to be Grace, and that's nothing to sneeze at, honey.
You shouldn't have thrown it away so quickly.
But, Grace, she's just notus.
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup Watch your mouth, or I'll wash it out with cheap vodka.
That's my little girl you're talkin' about.
Now, Grace is a damn good role model-- She's bright, she's successful, she's the worst dresser in the whole, wide world.
She's talented, and I look up to her.
Honey, why else would I be here?
You told me it's 'cause hate being home with Stan and the kids.
That's a big part of it.
But there's tons of places I could be away from them, and I choose to be away from them here.
Now, you came here to learn.
Let Grace teach you.
Well, I do wanna be a designer someday.
And so does she.
It's a perfect match.
Listen, get your ass over to Bergdorf's and buy her an I'm-Sorry gift, something she'd like, but nothing red.
Or orange.
Or yellow or green or stripes or plaids or zippers or epaulets.
Or fur or feathers or sequins or pleats.
You get the idea.
Yeah, I get the idea.
Hey, can I still use the word "honey"?
Wh--?
Aww No.
Hi, Karen.
I just wanted wanted you to know that I heard what you said, and I just wanted to say thank you.
Oh.
Oh, honey.
Or polka-dots!
Sorry I called you a tight-ass cyber-sissy.
Oh, that's ok.
Sorry I called you a shallow, youth-obsessed, prancing cabaret queen.
- You didn't call me that.
- Well, I meant to.
We really blew it.
You know, we had the perfect opportunity to educate people, maybe open up some minds, and instead we behaved like a couple of gay buffoons.
We wimped out on our entire community.
And the cold cuts are gone.
Nice.
Well, that was, uh, quite a production.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
What are you talking about?
I mean, it was riveting.
I mean, the way you depicted how words can wound people.
You know, I'm ashamed to say it, but I recognized a lot of my colleagues and myself in what you portrayed.
That's exactly what I imagined when I wrote it.
That's exactly what I imagined when I acted it.
It took people of great courage and maturity to do what you did.
Thank you very much, Officer?
Cox.
Officer Cox.
Hey, that was a great presentation.
I really got something out of it.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you for your help.
Hey, let me ask you something.
I know this guy.
I think he might be a gay but I don't know for sure.
"A gay"?
What makes you think he might be a gay, officer?
Well, he wears shorts.
He's always working out.
He's got really defined biceps.
Tight abs.
Rock-hard thighs.
- How's the ass?
- Good.
Nice and high.
Yeah I'd say someone's gay.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Will, what do you think?
Too gay?
Yeah, definitely.
But the shirt's good.
Ha ha ha.
Hold on, I got a cramp from not laughing.
It's for my show.
What show?
Oh.
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the theater, the tragic return of Just Jack!
Just Jack is dead to me.
I'm sick of people coming up to me on the street going, "nyeek nyeek".
That's just your mom.
And Rory.
Anyway.
I'm going a whole new way.
My new show is called Jack 2000.
God, you're a chameleon.
You're like Madonna.
without the corsets and the talent.
Just give me some fliers.
I'll pass them out at work.
What's this?
Unsolicited generosity?
Jack confused.
Well, I'm in a good mood, 'cause, um, something happened.
And I am telling you this, Jack McFarland, in confidence.
Oh, my God.
This must be really good.
Miss Hathaway, hold my calls.
You know the souvlaki vendor at the corner of Yeah.
He is kind of No, you didn't?
I did.
- But he doesn't speak a word of English.
- I know.
That is so hot.
Tell me what happened, quickly.
Where did you go?
Well, first we returned his cart.
Then we went for a long walk and ended up making out in the doorway of the Republican Party headquarters.
You're my new hero.
If you didn't smell like shaved lamb, I'd hug ya.
Hey.
Ho ho ho.
Man, do you look queer.
I wouldn't joke, Grace.
It's your shirt.
- So how was your date with Ben?
- Amazing.
We had this fantastic dinner at B.J., then we took one of those hansom cab rides around central park.
It was so romantic, it didn't even bother me that the horse's tail kept hitting me in the mouth.
Then he walked me home.
It started to rain.
It was like a movie.
It was a perfect evening.
- And now you're breaking up with him.
- Now I'm breaking up with him.
What happened?
You know, yesterday you were adding milk to your mochacino to show me what pretty colors your kids would be.
I'm not in love with him.
Sure, he's perfect on paper.
He's mature.
He's romantic.
All the smells work.
He's not prettier than me.
But the relationship just isn't going anywhere.
Grace, I really--I think you should give this another week.
Well, why?
I mean, what happens if during that week, I miss out on the chance of finding the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with?
Even so, one more week?
Ha haahem.
- What're you getting out of this?
- Nothing.
Why would I ge-- Um, uh, Ben promised me a Herman Miller chair for my office.
You're selling my ass so that yours can be comfortable?
And my back.
It's--it's really quite a chair, Grace.
- No.
- It's a Herman Miller.
- No.
- It's very expensive.
- No.
- It's got 198 positions.
So did Ben and I, but I'm still breaking up with him.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 5 Grace 0, Jack 2000 I object!
You're out of order!
No, you're out of order.
This whole court is out of order.
I assume in this case, you represent the Lollipop Guild?
It arrived a day early.
So you can break up with Ben now.
You have my full lumbar support.
Don't worry.
I'm going to do it today.
I even practiced on the cabdriver on the way over.
There was some tears, but Furuz Mahkbhubi and I agreed to stay friends.
Uh-huh.
Look what the arms do.
Huh?
There she is.
My gorgeous girl.
Come on, Ben, not in front of Grace.
Hey, baby.
Obviously you two have things to talk about.
It's ok.
I've got some serious work to do.
Meep, meep.
Meep, meep.
We got to get him a guy.
Ben, I need to talk to you about something.
Look I've given this a lot of thought, and, well, we both know that this has sort of played itself out, and I care about you so much, but I really think it would be best if we stop seeing each other.
No.
Excuse me?
No.
I don't accept that.
Well, I don't know if it's a matter of you accepting it or not.
- I mean, I do want to explain my feelings-- - No need.
We're fine.
No we're not.
I'm here to break up with you, and my mind is made up.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is!
Ben, I--I really, really want to break up with you.
- That's not what you want.
- Oh, but it is.
- No, it's not.
- Stop saying that!
Just saying the opposite of what I'm saying is not a legitimate argument.
Yes, it is.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.
God, this went so much better with Furuz Mahkbhubi.
I feel the earth, ouch, move, wow, under my feet, I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down, tumblin'-- hi!
Welcome to Jack, 2000.
And now in the tradition of Natalie and Nat King Cole, I'd like to sing a duet with a beautiful young man who's been such a huge inspiration to me.
- Yeah!
- Ing!
- Yeah!
- Bird!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah!
Mockingbird now - Everybody, have you heard?
- Have you heard?
- He's going to buy me a mockingbird - Mockingbird - And if that mockingbird don't sing - It doesn't sing - He's going to buy me a diamond ring - Diamond ring There isn't a drink maximum, is there?
- Now everybody have you heard?
- Have you heard?
Littl-l-l-le lamb.
Thank you.
Now comes the part of the show I like to call, "And how are you doing"?
So how are you all doing?
Ooh, quiet crowd.
No, we're just bored.
Been there.
Done that.
Got the T-shirt.
- So where are you from, sir?
- Um, New Hampshire.
Ahh, the Windy City.
- And what do you do there?
- Well, I live here now.
So.
So.
What?
You live here in the club?
You stink!
Ha ha.
Takes one to know one.
Takes one.
Takes one.
Takes one.
Jack, do another song or something.
- Shh, this is going to work.
- No, it isn't.
Yes, it is.
- You're dying out here.
- Would you just stick to what you do best, trolling the park for greasy souvlaki vendors?
He did, you know.
Yeah, the guy didn't speak a word of English, but fortunately, Will's fluent in skank.
Yeah, skank.
Jack?
Stop.
But hey, let's talk about Will's last significant relationship, huh?
Which took place about-- oh, it's 10:00-- 3 years ago!
Yeah, you want to know how little Willie tried to win him back?
- Yeah, I want to know!
- Jack, don't.
Don't do this.
By standing outside his bedroom window singing a medley of Peter, Paul, and Mary songs.
Too bad Michael rowed his boat ashore to another guy.
He's pretty funny, isn't he?
The reviews are in and the critics agree, the show's a smash.
Listen to this e-mail Rory just gave me.
"The show's a smash.
I'm really into Asians now".
But, uh, listen, it's really taking off for me, Will.
Listen, do me a favor.
If you see me acting like a big star, just keep me real.
I don't believe you.
I told you that story in confidence.
- Well how was I supposed to know that?
- Because I used the words: "I'm telling you this in confidence".
Well, let's not split hairs.
Especially yours, since you're thinning on top.
Ooh, that's good.
Open with the "thinning on top" bit.
Jack!
You are not allowed to take my personal life and put it on stage just for a few laughs.
A few laughs?
Were you there?
When I did the look on your face when Michael told you he was moving out I got a rolling laugh that went on for like-- A minute and a half.
Jack!
You hurt my feelings.
Get over yourself.
I am an artist.
It is my responsibility to draw from my life and the lives of others to get laughs and to sell cocktails.
Just like Picasso.
Right, but the key difference between you and Picasso is that he is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, and you are a raging pinhead.
I am never telling you anything again.
Fine!
I don't need you.
You-- Enemy of art!
Hey You guys have fun tonight?
Oh, you missed a great show.
Yeah, Jack decided to entertain the crowd with a few embarrassing tidbits from my personal life.
Oh, sweetie, that's horrible.
He didn't tell them about that time you stood up at model U.N. with the pee-pee track in your khakis, did he?
It was Sprite.
Maybe going in.
Just let it die!
I--I'm never telling Jack anything again.
Good!
You shouldn't.
That's the only way he'll learn.
You stick to your guns.
- How'd your breakup with Ben go?
- I slept with him.
What?
!
I know, I know, I know.
I went over there to make sure he really knew that we were broken up.
One thing led to another, and we ended having breakup sex.
Twice.
Ok!
3 times.
Let's see.
Once, twice, three times I don't think that makes you a lady.
You just doubled your pleasure!
Now you double my fun!
Sing out, Louise!
Jack, this is the most amazing story, and you are never going to believe it Mainly because you're never going to hear it.
What?
Remember, Jack, we don't do that anymore, 'cause you can't be trusted.
Pffft!
Now.
It's a documented scientific fact that one twin is always gay.
Which one is it?
The cute one or the cute one?
I ca-- Oh, no.
Look.
Luis forgot his javelin.
They came with props?
!
Speak!
I'm sorry, Jack, that's the price you pay for being an artist.
Or as the twins say-- oh, I can't tell you.
You, are no friend of mine!
I feel the earth, yawn, move, pfft, under my feet.
I feel the sky tumblin' down, tumblin' down, tumblin'-- back in an hour.
I hope you don't mind that I'm going to Jack's show tonight.
I just figure if I break up with Ben in a public place, there's a better chance I won't end up sleeping with him.
Grace, you gotta be tough about this.
- You got to tell him what you really want.
- Oh, I will.
See, that's good.
Now you sure you want to do this?
- Why?
You think I'm making a mistake?
- See.
That's bad.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who is it?
Honey, I don't yell.
Where the hell am I?
Is this student housing, and are bowling shoes back?
Ok.
I'm changing.
Hey.
Hey, Wilma.
Come on.
You got to come with me down to Jack's club.
He's bombing.
Come on.
Beep, beep, beep, let's go.
Of course he's bombing, because he doesn't have me to make fun of.
Forget get it.
I'm not going to put myself into a position to be laughed at again.
It's the same reason I don't throw a ball in front of people.
Lord, you're sick.
He's bombing because he's miserable.
And he's miserable because you're still mad at him.
Yeah, he's sullen.
He's morose.
He's humorless.
He's-- oh, my god.
He's you.
Ahem.
You know, if Hell ever needs an ambassador-- God!
Why do I always have to be the adult?
Because you are the adult, Will.
Come on.
Let him off the hook.
Show a little kindness.
Honey, not those.
Oh, God.
I can't stand it any longer.
You're chewing like a big cow.
Hand it over!
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
I'm breaking up with Ben, tonight.
What's the problem, Grace?
He's not gay?
No, he's--great.
He's just not right.
Of course he's not white.
Sheesh - Right.
He's not right.
- Listen, Ben is a catch.
And for some reason, he's crazy about you.
What is your problem?
Amazing how one little cardboard tree can make so little difference.
Look, Karen, the bottom line is I'm just not in love with him.
Yeah, well, all I know is ever since you two got together, I've never seen you happier.
How do you know that's not love?
You flash in the pan.
You one-hit wonder.
You Vanilla Ice.
You know what?
You're right.
He is better than any guy I've ever gone out with.
Am I sabotaging what could be the best thing that's ever happened to me?
That is my M.O. I mean, this is a man who refused to break up with me.
That's love.
He loves me.
If I weren't so picky, maybe I would love him, too.
Maybe I do.
Maybe this is what love feels like.
I should just say it.
I love him.
I said it.
That wasn't so hard.
I love him.
- I love him!
- Hey, baby.
Hey, you!
- Hey.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Supporting the arts.
I mean, after all, I spent years supporting the artist.
So what are you saying?
I'm saying Use it all.
The souvlaki guy, Michael leaving, the Sprite on my khakis in front of the Security Council.
Ooh, the pee-pee story?
Hey, hey.
What about those twins?
Oh, well, you know.
We met in the park.
Tossed the javelin.
I got a groin pull.
They carried me home.
It was humiliating.
But ask me out there.
The crowd'll eat it up.
- My gosh, Will.
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome, artist Formerly known as princess.
Hey, I just want to say something.
I am so glad we are back together.
Oh, yeah.
About that.
I've been giving it some thought.
I think it would be best for me if we stopped seeing each other.
- Wait.
What are you talking about?
- Aw, come on, Grace.
I mean, we're not in love, so I'm ending this.
No, but you-- Oh!
All right.
I get it.
I see what's going on here.
Ok.
Ok.
Well, guess what?
I don't accept it.
Well, that's immaterial, because I am breaking up with you.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
No, you're not!
Look!
I've been pushed around enough about this.
I know what I want, and I want you, and we're staying together.
There's nothing you could say to change my mind.
- Grace?
- Oh, you're right.
- Just for the record, I broke up with you.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.
Hey, everybody!
Welcome back.
Now comes the part of the show that I like to call, "And how are you all doing"?
Let's look out into the audience, shall we?
Ooh!
I see somebody I know.
Mr. Will Truman.
Want to hear a little something about Will?
Yeah.
He's-- There's a, um-- He's a friend of mine.
Hey, where you from?
- Montana.
- Only two things I know come from Montana-- Steers and queers.
Everybody, welcome.
What is wrong with me?
It's like I can be talking to anything.
Ooh.
Don't say that when you're giving me a back rub.
Yeah, you do look tight.
Any requests?
Just play something that'll make me feel better.
Ben, the two of us need look no more Nice.
We both found what we were looking for With a friend to call my own.
You'll never be alone-- You know what?
I forget the rest of it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Yeah, you're a wicked little schoolboy to be talking to me like this in the middle of a work day.
I'll make you stay after school and bang the erasers.
Ok, ok, yeah.
Yeah, you like it rough.
Don't you, you dirty little monkey?
Yeah.
Next time I see you, I'm gonna bend you over my knee-- Oh, crap, I gotta go.
Mom and mom are home.
Now we know how she's making that extra $2.95 per minute.
You know, you talk a lot of trash about that husband of yours, but when you get right down to it, you two still have the hots for each other.
Yeah Yeah, we do.
But that wasn't Stan.
That was your boyfriend, Nicholas something.
Nicholas?
Nicholas is an ex-boyfriend.
Honey, with you, I thought the "ex" was implied.
He flew into town this weekend.
He can't wait to see you.
Which I guess would make you his layover.
"Grace Adler is now ready for boarding.
Buckle up.
There's bound to be some turbulence".
What are you, 10?
- So who is this sexy exie, anyway?
- He's a cellist with the Boston Symphony.
We went out for a little while a couple of years ago.
It was, uh, interesting.
Grace is just being modest.
It was terrible.
- For six weeks, all you guys did was fight like cats.
- Yeah, but we made up like dogs.
Oh, I can't wait to see him.
Grace Adler Designs.
Hey there, big daddy.
- What are you up to, you little dirty dirty?
- Ok, hang up, hang up.
Hey, sexy.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Will & Grace Saison 3 - Episode 6 Love Plus One synchro: kingo Ok, I say yes on the pants, yes on the sweater, and definitely yes with the other decision you're struggling with, ok?
Hey.
Hey.
Psst, Jack.
- Oh, hey, Karen-- - Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka!
I'm Anastasia Beaverhausen!
Why are you using your alias?
Because I passed a couple of bad checks here.
You know, for sport?
Mrs. Beaverhausen, can you believe it?
Me, a Banana Republic sales associate.
And my guidance counselor said I'd never amount to anything.
Honey, I'm so proud of you.
Come on.
Let's go to Barney's.
There's a new salesgirl there, and we gotta get her fired.
She has a gray tooth.
Come on.
I can't.
I can't.
I'm working.
Hello?
Well, yeah, and I'm ovulating, but nothing's gonna come of that, either.
You don't understand.
I have responsibilities.
Look, a headset.
You know This isn't working.
This is gonna interfere with our friendship.
I work a 40-hour month for what's-her-name, - and I always make time for us.
Come on.
- Karen-- I can't, all right?
But I promise.
Nothing's gonna change between us.
Hey, I'll come over later, and we'll short-sheet Rosario's bed.
Ok.
Maybe we can take a big bubble bath together.
Nothing would give me more pleasure than to sponge-clean the Beaverhausen.
- Wilma.
- Anastasia.
Uh, hey.
I just received a message saying you have a new job and you're going to buy me dinner.
There's, like, 18 things wrong with that sentence.
Will, The Banana has changed my life.
It's all about The Banana.
Hasn't it always been?
Hey, save that smut for Loehman's.
You're in The Republic now.
Hey, Grace.
Nicholas.
Hi.
- It's been a long time.
- Yeah, it has.
Even longer, since you were supposed to be here 20 minutes ago.
What are you talking about?
You said "1:20".
- I said 1:00.
Who says "meet at 1:20"?
- Here we go.
I've been waiting here a half hour.
I was so bored, I almost started to read.
Listen Don't blame me because you're unclear--as usual.
I was totally clear.
You just hear whatever you want to hear.
- You look hot.
- So do you.
- So, how's Boston?
- Do you really care?
No.
Just making conversation till we get to the good stuff.
- How about that?
I'm fresh out of conversation.
- How about that?
There you are.
- Oh, hey, love.
- Hey, baby.
You must be Grace.
So nice to meet you.
Thank you You I'm not late, am I?
You told me to be here at 1:35.
Oh, my God.
I've been looking for this book.
It's the perfect size to replace that little foot that broke off my hamper.
- I'll be right back.
- Ok.
So, uh Your sister seems nice?
No, she-- She's not my sister.
She's my girlfriend.
She joined the Symphony last year.
She plays the flute.
Nicholas, I'm so embarrassed.
I mean, if I had known that kiss before was just a "hello" kiss, I would have used a lot less tongue.
See, when you called, I thought you wanted to get together to do what we get together to do.
That's right.
- But you have a girlfriend now.
- That's right.
Ok, I guess I'm a little dense, 'cause, I mean, you can't have sex with me and your girlfriend at the same time.
That's wrong.
What?
But Oh.
Oh, but-- Oh!
- Oh, my God.
There he is.
He's back.
- Who?
The man I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.
Look at him, Will.
He's perfection.
So loverly.
- He makes me want to be a bigger man.
- You mean "a better man".
Yeah, that, too.
- How do you know he's gay?
- He beeped.
- He's a cutie.
Why don't you go talk to him?
- I can't.
You "can't"?
What woulYou're not shy around men.
You'd hit on the Pope if he drove a better car.
Come on.
You're get it, you're Jack.
Get in there.
- I'm Jack.
- You're Jack.
- I'm Jack.
- Jack.
- I'm Jack.
- You're Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack.
I'm Jack-- Does this shirt come in anything besides cranberry?
Because I just don't think it will go with my gooseberry pants.
So, what fruit will go with this pants?
Uh, gandaberry, lingonberry, Halle Berry?
Ok, thanks.
Me!
I'm the fruit that would go with those pants.
Nice try.
Tell me.
Does this come in a boot?
Can you imagine me in a 3-way?
Honey, I can barely imagine you in 2-way.
Hey, come on.
I mean, it's not outside the realm of possibility.
Grace, I can see me in a 3-way.
I can see Karen in a 3-way.
Oh, honey, every night with Stan is a 3-way-- Me, him, and Johnnie Walker Black.
Just the three of us.
But you're just not that girl.
No way, no how.
Hey, I have been known to get a little crazy in the boudoir.
Some might even call mekinky.
Hey!
Sweetheart.
People who are truly kinky never use the word kinky.
And who the hell says "boudoir"?
!
"Hey, hey.
Look at me.
I'm kinky, and I'm in the boudoir".
Ok.
Ok, ok.
So maybe I haven't had sex with more than one person at a time, but I've done a lot of crazy things.
I once had sex in the kitchen.
Ooh.
What are you-- A rock star?
All right.
No.
You're done.
I have clients coming.
Get out.
If I don't, are you gonna spank me, kinko?
- Get out!
- Whoa!
If I hear anything like that in the boudoir, watch out!
I don't care what either of you say, I am not a prude.
Oh, honey.
Come on.
Come on.
I love you like the mother I had committed against her will.
But you are Prudence McPrude, the Mayoress of Prudie Town.
Karen, you are wrong.
Quack, quack.
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!
- Quack.
Look, you know what?
Not only am I the kind of person who would do a 3-way, I'm the kind of person who's going to do a 3-way.
So say good-bye to Prudence McPrude, and say hello to Slutly Slutenstein.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Jack.
Jack, you have a visitor, and he's cute.
If I didn't have a girlfriend, I'd be so into him.
He'll be right here.
Hey, hey.
What's with this page?
"Baby bear needs mama bear".
You- You're only supposed to use that in a gay emergency.
It is an emergency.
He's back.
His pants Are ready.
Have lovelier words ever been uttered?
Say it soft, and it's almost like praying.
I need your help, Will.
I figured out what it is about him that scares me.
He's a smarty.
I heard him on his cell phone using big words like "particular" and "delicatessen".
I need you to make me smart.
All right.
I'll--I'll need a mad scientist, two electric switching helmets, and a willing monkey.
There's not enough time.
Oh, my God.
There he is.
- Please, Will, help me.
- I still don't understand what you want me to do.
It's not like I can talk for you.
Oh, my God.
You're a girl genius.
That's exactly what you can do.
Scott, call home.
Your girlfriend's pregnant.
- What?
How?
- Just go.
No, no, no.
No, Jack.
This is ridiculous.
No.
I've never felt this way about anyone.
Please.
All right.
What could possibly go wrong with this plan?
Testing, testing.
Sibilant.
Rhubarb.
My dog has fleas.
Yeah, I hear you, Jack.
Approaching target.
Approaching target.
Oh, my.
Look how flat target's stomach is.
Ok, I'm in.
Give me a line a smarty would open with.
Hello?
Hello.
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.
It's working.
I just bought She's Come Undone, but I was disappointed when I got home and I realized it wasn't a biography of J. Edgar Hoover.
So what are you reading these days?
Oh, good question.
What am I reading?
What am I reading?
What am I reading?
Actually, I'm re-reading an old favorite, Rabbit Run.
Actually, I'm re-reading an old favorite, Rabid Nun.
- Rabbit Run, you idiot.
- Rabbit Run, you idiot.
Rabbit Run.
No!
- You're the idiot!
- No, you're the idiot!
I mean-- I mean, I'm the idiot.
I'm c-c-crazy.
- Why did you let me do that?
- Hey!
A ventriloquist is only as good as his dummy.
- So listen, Matthew-- - So listen, Matthew-- --if you like She's Come Undone, you know what else you might like?
--if you like She's Come Undone, you know what else you might like?
If I tore off my clothes and gave you a lap dance on the V-neck sweaters.
If I tore-- If I-- If I tore over here and invited you to caress the insole of our brand-new seamed Oxford.
Ooh, seems a little fast.
I like to get to know a shoe before I put my foot in it.
Take it to dinner, buy it a sock.
So, what is it you do?
So, what is it you do?
- I work in television.
- Oh, my God.
I love TV.
Buffy is my life.
I'm so into Willow being a lez.
Did you have anything to do with that?
No, I'm a sports writer.
I write news, sports, you know, like that.
Sports?
I got nothing.
The last sporting event I watched was "Circus of the Stars".
- Hey, do you have this in a size 8?
- I don't work here.
- So, back to Buffy.
Is it really-- - Forget Buffy, you boob.
- Ask him what he does for fun.
- What do you do for fun?
Oh, I don't know.
Let's see, uh Oh.
Well, tonight, I'm going to an opening at the Spielman Gallery, where I'll probably get shamed into buying some art.
- Oh, my god.
I got-- - Oh, my God.
I got shamed at that gallery, too.
That little skinny woman with the big hands and the blue veins who wouldn't take no for an answer.
I know her.
She did a number on me.
She made me buy this 4x6 canvas of a foot.
Fortunately, I got out of there before she made me buy this hideous sculpture they had out front.
- Japanese Man With Fish?
- Japanese Man With Fish?
- Japanese Man With Fish.
- I bought it.
- I bought it.
- You didn't.
- I did.
- Hey, can we talk about something I'm interested in?
!
Jack, Jack.
Don't bail.
This is working.
- Look, Matthew.
Let me ask you something.
- Matthew, let me ask you something.
And don't take this the wrong way.
Get out of here, you silly woman!
Get out of here, you silly woman!
You, you silly woman.
Out!
Now, where were we?
I think I should get going.
All right, look.
Obviously, you have some stuff you need to work out up here, ok?
Um, and I don't know if I'm invested enough to start couples counseling.
Maybe it's just as well, Jack, because I think I'm interested in somebody else.
Yeah.
Whatever you need to tell yourself, ok.
Just promise me you'll allow yourself some time to grieve.
Maybe I can start the grieving process while you get my pants.
Good idea.
Will, you're fired.
Hey, listen, lady.
I told-- Oh, sorry.
Call me.
It was nice talking to you.
Me?
Well, the-- Well, you and Jerry Lewis need to work on your act.
I don't know what happened.
W-we killed at The Gap.
The-the first one's my home number.
- I'm Will, by the way.
- I'm Matt.
Matt, I know.
Nice meeting you.
You, too.
You think Jack's gonna be ok?
I just need to measure your inseam.
- But I just want socks.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think the healing process has already begun.
Ok, I'm here.
What's first?
Who's first?
How do we do this?
First, we slow down.
Come on in.
Let me take your coat.
You're not nervous, are you?
Nervous?
No.
What gave you that idea?
Two coats.
Look at that.
Well, the first coat's really just a primer.
It won't get in the way of anything we're doing here.
- So where's Paula?
- I'm here.
Hi, Grace.
Hey, hey, Paula.
Let me take your coat.
Oh, thank you.
Oh.
Ok, go.
Come on.
Relax, Grace.
It's gonna be fun.
We're just gonna-- - Nicholas?
- What?
Why did you put my flute on the window?
You know it can't get wet.
- I'm sorry.
- Geez.
I'm sorry.
Look, it's no big deal-- Hey!
You want me to sit between the two of you.
Ok.
Isn't it funny how this is the universal symbol for take a seat?
I mean, it's the same to everybody-- Kids, dogs, sluts.
Come on, Grace.
Don't say that.
Do you remember when I - Remember?
- Yeah.
It could be just like that.
Ok?
Well, it's just-- this time I'd have to wait my turn, but-- Ok.
There you go.
Ok Yeah, that feels better.
Hmm Ok, I'm gonna have to work my way up to you, but nice robe.
Oh.
Oh, that feels nice.
Strong hands.
Oh!
More strong hands.
They're popping up everywhere.
Just like Starbucks franchises, only sexy.
She has beautiful hair, doesn't she, Paula?
What?
You're still on the flute?
- Well, you put it there on purpose, didn't you?
- Give me a break, please?
Oh, gosh.
Oh, that's nice.
I really had a knot there.
Because if I put your cello there under the window, the wrath that would rain down on me-- The only purpose of a flute is to make people cry during Irish movies.
You know what?
I am done.
Next time you want to do a 3-way, why don't you do it with your cello and your ego?
Well, at least my cello makes noise when I touch it.
- Guys?
- I hate you, Nicholas!
I am so tired of you, Paula.
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute.
Do you know how much soul-searching I had to do to come up with the courage to-- Oh, damn it.
I am burning up!
Look This is not me, ok?
I'm a good girl from Schenectady.
I went to Sunday school for 10 years.
I was 16 before I let Bobby Kay go to second.
So for me to come and participate in this is a big deal.
So you two kiss and make up, because the three of us are gonna GET IT ON!
- Baby, you are so hot!
- Let's do this right now.
Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.
What is it?
W-w-what, what?
This isn't me, ok?
I'm a good girl from Schenectady.
I went to Sunday school for 10 years.
I was 16 before I let Bobby Kay go to second, so for me to come here and participate, this is a big deal.
Too big a deal.
So I'm sorry, but I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna have to back out of this.
And I just want to make this as smooth an exit as possible, so I'm just gonna take my sweater and my sweatshirt and my jacket and my other jacket.
Gosh, I feel like I'm leaving you high and dry.
Do you want me to get the concierge?
She--she looked pretty cute.
Ok.
I guess I always thought of myself as a little kinky.
Come on, Grace.
It's ok.
I've never been in a 3-way.
Yeah, but you're gay.
You have the kinky built in.
Oh, sure.
That's why I joined.
So, come on.
How was your sexcapade, honey?
Were you the ham in a philharmonic sandwich?
Did you roll over for Beethoven?
- You want me to tell her?
- No, that's ok.
I'm not ashamed.
It was fantastic.
There were so many arms and legs everywhere, Hindus were praying to us.
Oh You sleazy skank.
What?
Karen-- I gotta take the rest of the day off.
The air in this room is ripe with filth.
For God's sake, Grace.
I'm a mother.
Oh!

Ok, here we go.
It's a gift certificate from a psychic.
Why would I possibly want to discuss my future with Psychic Sue ?
Will, she is so amazing.
I just went to her a couple of days ago, and she knew everything about me.
She knew that I didn't get along with my mother, she knew I had relationship problems, and she knew my best friend was gay.
You just described all of the single women in New York.
What's that, Cher ?
Yeah, when they're not talking about me, I get bored, too.
Hi, guys.
Sorry I'm late, but I wanted to make sure I missed most of dinner.
Oh, you're gonna be joining them ?
Hey, apron.
Who told you you could make eye contact ?

I'm having fun.
Where's that freakin' birthday cake ?
Happy birthday, dude.
Ok, no.
No, no.
First of all, that is not the birthday dude.
Second of all, you were supposed to sing.
And third of all, this is not the chocolate soufflÃ© I ordered at the beginning of the meal.
It's broccoli quiche !
II guess I forgot to put the order in.
I got sidetracked making a buttload of cappuccinos.
- All right, that's it.
Excuse me.
- Is everything ok ?
No, it's not.
It's my best friend's birthday, and that horrible waiter has just he's ruined our entire evening.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
Let me handle this.
- Thank you.
- Grace, it's No, I'm glad I did it.
He's just been terrible.
Grace, being a waiter is hard.
You have to be everything to these people.
Mother, father, psychiatrist, lover Ok Ma'am, I apologize.
The meal has been comped.
The meal was my gift.
And we've let that waiter go.

I don't know about you, but I think I've done this restaurant a service.

It was thatthat waiter from the restaurant last night.
Lenny.
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.
Oh, my little girl's growing up !
No, this is this is not something I'm proud of.
I didn't mean to get him fired.
I just thought that he'd be reprimanded and I'd get a free mud pie.
Oh, come on.
There's always some poor sap who will hire him.
Hey, Grace, I'm gonna run down, get us some muffins.
Oh, hey, how you doin' ?
You remember me ?

I just broke my grandmother's China.
China ?
And you just tripped.
That's very weird, 'cause that's exactly what she said.
That's because she's Psychic Sue.
What is that smell ?
Why do you always look at me when you say that ?
No, no, it smells like Like my mother.
Oh, um, that package came from her over there.
That's what it is.
It smells like that that tea rose perfume she always wears.
That's better than my mother.
She smells like brisket and Aquanet.
Oh, my God.
"Found this in the attic, thought you might want it.
Call your Father.

Grace, the guy's a loser.
The whole office is talking about it.
Oh, and am I drunk, or did I just take a whole bottle of whipped cream and go like this: ssshhhhhhhh.
Yes and no.
Don't smoke it all at once.
It's primo, man.

You know what's scary ?
This isn't even the weirdest thing he's ever done with a small plastic woman.
I feel like nesting.
Let's stay home and rent Silkwood.
I'm a lesbian who's been exposed to nuclear waste, hoh !
I'm gonna make some popcorn with several underused spices.
Who wants some ?
I do, I do !
What did you just say ?
I said, I do, I do.
I really do.
What ?
Why are you looking at me funny ?
Oh, hi, Grace.
Hi.
Wow.
Wow, look at this place.
Yeah, well, you know, I told a few people about you, and they told a few people, and I guess a lot of folks are jonesing for an interior designer.
Wow.
I haven't been this popular since the misprint in the yellow pages made me the "Breast Designer in New York".
Ah, why don't we start with you ?
Oh, um, I have a whole studio I want to do, and I'm definitely gonna want some ottomans.
Can the four of us split an ottoman ?
So, how fast can we do this ?
'Cause I'm having a party this weekend.
Ok, uh, what I'm gonna do is show you what I did in this loft in Soho.
In fact, what I can do for your Oh, shoot.
Hand me that, please.
Thanks.
Wait, what is this ?
Oh, my bad.
Hi, honey.
How was your day ?
What are you doing here ?
Would you calm down ?
I'm just using your tub.
And your Ylang-Ylang.
Do ya like, ya like ?
Why don't ya leave, ya leave ?
Why are you so crabby ?
Bad day at the office ?
No.
I just wanted to come home And not to Madame Butterfly.
Hello, gorgeous suit.
When did we get this, huh ?
And it fits you so nice.
The shoulders, and the pecs, and the pits, and the waist I am not having sex with you !
- What ?
- I am never having sex with you !
We are never gonna have sex.
Sex, with you, no.
Oh, you poor thing, that wasn't sex.
All right, uh, how can I explain this ?
Um Ok, when two men are in love and committed And greased up like pigs at a county fair No !
Psychic Sue said I'm gonna spend my life with a man named Jack.
- Jack who ?
- Jack you !
- Jack me ?
- No, thanks !
Look, you know ordinarily I wouldn't believe all this psychic stuff, but, I mean, she's been right about everything else, and What if she's right about this ?
Eww !
Well, what if she is right ?
What would that be like ?
Well, I'mI'm gonna have to have my own place.
Yeah, and sex is out of the question.
I don't even like seeing your head poke through the hole in your sweater.
Andand just so you know, I'm gonna need boyfriends.
And, since my career comes first, you may have to support me.
Right.
What about Grace ?
Oh, you get custody of that.
So, let's see.
No sex, our own boyfriends, I support you, you live across the hall, Grace is my roommate.
That would be weird, wouldn't it ?
Hey.
Where's the slow talker ?
I fired him, ok ?
He totally took advantage of me.
You were right.
People will always let you down.
Oh, Grace.
What ?
Nothing.
It just felt like it needed an "Oh, Grace".
I tell you what, this is never gonna happen to me again.
From now on, I trust no one.
Oh, honey.
- What ?
- Here we are again.
- People suck.
- Oh, come on !
Don't do that.
This is a bad color on you.
And your attitude is poor, too.
You're the one who loves people.
You're the pretty little gal from Ioway with the heart as big as all get out.
Karen, I'm from upstate New York.
Whatever.
I got a facial in an hour.
Listen, bottom line: it's a good thing that you believe in people.
I mean, maybe Lenny let you down, but, hey !
You took a chance on me, and have I ever let you down ?
Oh, Karen.
What ?
Just felt like it needed an "Oh, Karen".
So, why'd you can old swarthy Pete, anyway ?
He was selling dope out of the swatch room.
What ?
Grace, I can't believe it !
I loved him !
Please stop staring.
Yes, it's Cher.
Ok, that's it.
Nothing for us.
This Cher thing is out of control.
We're going.
What's the problem ?
You made us wait for an hour for a table for four !
In the back, so she wouldn't be gawked at.
- Ok, bye-bye.
- Freak.
You're the freaks !
You know, dude, it is a little weird that you're talking to my doll.
Um, I don't think I need a drag queen to define normal behavior, ok ?
But I will say this.
The look ?
It's flawless.
Whatever.
Ooh, workin' the attitude.
Ok, you're good.
I've had a lot of practice.
Hey, hey, hey !
You're not that great, mister sister.
All right ?
I do a better Cher than you.
You think so ?
Actually, it's "You think so, hoh "!
Are you kidding me with this ?
Ok, the hand is perfect, but it's more "Are you kidding me with this, hoh "!
Get a life.
If I could turn back time.
If I could turn back ti-ome.
Ti-ome.
Ti-ome.
Ti-ome.
Snap out of it !

{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
All right, bad news.
Hostess says it'll be at least 45 minutes for a table.
Did you tell 'em you were with the star of Jack 2000, soon to be Jack 2001?
Yes, I did.
And she gave me a similar hand gesture, but with a different finger.
- Maybe we should do this another night.
- Nooooo.
Sweetie, we talked about that sound.
But we're all leaving tomorrow.
I want us to have dinner together before Thanksgiving.
You mean tonight isn't thanksgiving?
Oh, crap.
Now I have to spend all day tomorrow, watching Stan gorge himself on thighs and breasts and turkey.
Well, if we have to wait, um, why don't I get a bottle of champagne?
That's a nice idea.
What would you guys like?
Can I have another one of those, only bigger?
Oh, tears, booze I love the holidays, too.
Do you think that men can't be trusted?
Honey, I've always said, if your genitals are on the outside, you're hiding something on the inside.
I should warn you.
Further conversation with her will only lead to more tears.
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.
Grace, leave her alone.
She obviously doesn't want to talk.
It's my boyfriend, Tom.
I mean, I don't know what happened.
You know, just when things started to get kinda serious, he starts to pull away.
Which is so weird because we have so much in common, like, we're both dance majors We both know all the songs from "The Wiz"-- And we both collect Victorian dolls.
What's your name, dear?
- Pam.
- Pam.
Hi, I'm Jack McFarland, of course.
Come, join our little circle of love and dysfunction.
This is Karen Walker.
This is Will Truman right here.
And this is your sorry ass future, if you don't dump that boyfriend of yours.
Jack!
I-- Will, defend me.
Come on, man.
Yeah, guys, our little Pammy's in pickle.
And, uh, shouldn't we help her find her way back to a place called hope?
Honey, she's wearing synthetic plaid.
It's a 4-day drive and a boat trip to a place called hope.
What are you talking about?
Well, I think you need to hear a little story about when these two were dating.
Or as I like to call it, "When Mary Met Sally".
- Jack - No.
No.
You are not telling that story.
It was an incredibly difficult time in my life, and this is not the time or the place.
The year was 1985.
My freshman year in college So, uh, this is the big weekend, huh?
- You going to her house for Thanksgiving?
- Oh, yeah.
It is a scientific fact that college girls love getting it on in their folks' house.
You have nailed her, haven't you?
Oh, please!
Huh.
I've not only nailed her, I--I've sanded, buffed, stained and spackled her.
Ok, what do you mean you and Will have never done it?
Well, he wants to take it slow, and I see his point.
I mean, we're soul mates, so there's no rush.
Yeah, I taught her a few things.
Let me tell you my friend, she's an excellent student.
Like he taught me how to scrunch my hair to keep the curl.
You know me, nothing I love more than sex.
Wi-wi-with a woman.
And he's so handsome.
He reminds me of those old Hollywood movie stars, like Rock Hudson or Montgomery Clift.
Ok, fine.
Do what you want.
Just afraid you're gonna miss your window.
Oh, please.
Don't be insane.
What window?
Ok, you know my psych professor, Dr. Bonami, he says if you don't do it with a guy right away, you just end up as friends.
- Did he really say that?
- Yeah.
Do you-- Do you really think if you're-- Friends I would die if that happened.
I mean, - who wants a guy as a friend?
- Uh, thank you.
If I want to take this relationship to the next level, we have to make love soon.
Like this weekend.
Don't say, "make love".
It sounds, like, totally gay.
Yo, beer's gone.
Bye, sweetie.
I'm gonna pack.
Bye.
That's ok, I'll clean up.
Hi.
- What are you doing in the closet?
- I could ask the same of you.
What?
!
Who are you?
Oh, how quickly they forget.
We met at Matt Stokes' party.
My card.
"Jack McFarland.
Since 1969".
What are you even doing here?
Aren't you in high school?
Well, I prefer the college parties 'cause the fellas tend to be less uptight about their homosesuality.
Oh, yeah, now I remember you.
You were the one going around telling everybody you were in Duran Duran.
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
Yeah.
Oh, a-and you think everybody's gay.
No, not everybody, just me And you and a dog named Boo.
Hey, hey.
Heh.
I'm not gay.
Well, this well-worn copy of the "Dreamgirls" soundtrack begs to differ.
Anyway, what does this have to do with Tom and me?
Let me shorthand it for you, honey.
The Sultan of Boran?
- What does that have to do w-- - Your story was boring.
Anyway, after my little talk with Ellen, I decided that it had to be that weekend.
So, we took a train up to my parent's house in Schenectady, where Will learned the answer to that age-old question, "What ever did happen to Baby Jane"?
Gloria, Gloria.
I think they got your number, Gloria.
I think I got your alias, Gloria and you been living under, ahaaaaa-- Mom!
- Hi, mom.
Hi, Julius.
- Honey, you're home.
Grace, I always forget how beautiful you are.
Mom giveth.
Why do you have to cock it up with that hair?
And Mom taketh away.
You must be Will.
Lovely to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Adler.
You have a beautiful home.
- Your interior decorator did a great job.
- Oh, no no no no.
I did it myself.
No!
It looks so professional.
Oh, aren't you a darling?
Your mom's good.
No, you're good.
Say hello to Julius, my arranger.
- Hi.
- Hell-ooh.
So, Julius, what do we think about Will?
I think where there's a Will, there's a way.
Isn't he clever?
Why some woman has never snatched him up is beyond me.
- Where's daddy?
- Uh, he's in Connecticut.
Grandma Rose threatened to die.
Joyce, your sister's here!
Big whup!
You get down here or I'll knock you till Tuesday!
- Would you like a little juice?
- I'm fine, thanks.
Hi, Joyce.
Don't you be all nice just 'cause your boyfriend's here.
I know that you stole my poncho, you skank.
Uh, Joyce, hi.
I-I'm Will.
Grace showed me that drawing of a unicorn you did at, uh, Camp Yes-I-Can.
Yeah, it was beautiful.
I wish I could draw like that.
It's no big deal.
- You've an older sister don't you?
Janet?
- No.
Why don't you two go on upstairs and put your things down.
Joyce, you'll stay down here.
Will, you'll stay in Joyce's room.
Grace, you'll stay in your room.
What?
No, Will's gonna sleep in my bedroom with me.
- No, no, no, he isn't.
- Grace, it--it's fine.
Nooooo!
Nooooo!
Mom, you can't do that.
This is so unfair.
Well, so's my cottage cheese ass, but Why is that always your answer for everything?
Will and I are adults.
We've been going out for nearly three months now, - and I think that we should have-- - Grace!
we only have two rules in this house.
Number one: boys and girls don't sleep in the same bedroom, unless they're married.
And Will, always light matches in the bathroom after poopie-doos.
So, then, we have dinner, and we look at a zillion pictures of a nude 2-year-old Grace riding the family dog.
Oh, you like that do ya?
Well, maybe you'd like a little of this, huh?
Yeah, you do, don't ya?
Huh, huh?
Karen, what are you do-- Are you-- Are you flashing that woman?
!
She started it.
She's nursing.
Hmm.
That explains the little bald man.
Anyway, later that night, I'm getting ready for bed, I figure, now I'm safe.
Aahh!
What--what Shh.
Shh.
Relax.
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
Wha--you shouldn't be here, you know.
We're gonna get in trouble.
Not if we're quiet.
But if you play your cards right, I might not be.
What are you suggesting?
Well, you, me A bed I thought that we might Don't make me say it.
Grace, I don't know.
- Mmm.
Come on.
What are we waiting for?
- Well, I'm just-- I'm kind of tired.
All that turkey Made me sleepy.
Really?
'Cause it made me horny.
- J-J-Just a sec.
- But I said I was horny.
Just a minute, I--I think those new potatoes weren't so new.
Oh, poor baby.
The matches are under the macramé turtle.
Thank you.
Mom, phone!
Mom!
Su-su-sussudio.
Hi, Jack, it's-- it's Will Truman.
Oh, right, from Queens College?
No, I go to Columbia.
Missy, anywhere you go is Queens College.
Yeah, oh-- You know what?
That-- That's why I called.
You know, what you said really bugged me.
I am not gay.
Mom!
There's chicken on the rug!
I was saying That you--you know nothing about me, because if you did know me, you would know that I'm not gay.
Oh, yeah.
Now I get it.
Ahem.
You're in stage 3-- You've bought the short shorts, but you're afraid to put 'em on.
Yeah, put 'em on, Will.
Come on.
Put 'em on.
Stop saying that.
Ok?
I am not-- You're gay, Will!
Ok?
You're gayer than the day is long.
You're Marvin Gaye.
And let me tell you somethin'-- Ain't no closet big enough.
This-- this is ludicrous.
We spent all of four minutes together.
Yeah, and in the first four seconds, I could tell that you were carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders And about 20 extra pounds on your hips.
And why wouldn't you?
It's a drag pretending to be something you're not.
Yeah, if I'm pretending, then how come I can't wait to get back in there and have sex with my girlfriend?
Well, if you can't wait to get back in there and make muskrat love to your girlfriend, then why are you on the phone with me?
Yeah, that's what I thought.
You're my new best friend.
Call me every five minutes.
Crap.
Why today?
Hi, I was starting to get worried about-- What-- What-- What's with you?
Let's have some sex.
Feel the heat.
Pushing you to decide-- - Enough already!
- Shut up!
You were losin' her.
I had to do somethin'.
But you know, for a sultan, dude knew how to party.
Later we did Jell-O shots with one of the guys from Hall and Oates.
Hall?
Oates.
Back to my story.
Honey, I've got some bad news.
As much as I would love to be Mrs. Habibi Shoshani Padush Al-Kabir, I'm afraid I can't marry you.
I'm just not in love with you.
I'm in love with another man.
Sure, he hasn't got your money, but I really think that with my help, we can make it work.
Just come back to my house in Fort Lee and make love with me one more time.
Sorry, sultan.
I'm a little emotionally drained.
I think I'm just gonna go home and cry myself to sleep.
Karen, where have you been?
I've been lookin' all over for you, baby.
Oh, Clayton, I got some bad news.
I can't marry you.
I'm in love with another man.
But does he have my moxie?
Can he make love to you all night long?
Well, the way he does it, he makes it feel like it's all night long, but I really think with my help, we can make it work.
Karen, I don't know what to say.
I'll never meet another woman like you.
Oh That's so true.
Listen, honey.
I'm emotionally drained.
I think I'm just gonna go home and cry myself to sleep.
Oh, Martina.
Karen, where have you been?
I've missed you.
Oh, honey, listen.
I've got some bad news.
I can't marry you.
I'm in love with someone else.
But, Karen, I was straight before I met you.
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles, Marti.
Well, then who?
And can she give you what I give you?
You mean companionship, vitality, a sneaky drop shot?
No, no.
No, he's a doughy thing with squat little legs and a bad case of recurring psoriasis, but I love him, and with my help Oh!
Who am I kidding?
I just love him.
Who knows why?
I love Stanley Walker!
Now that's a story!
Ha ha!
So Will comes back from the bathroom Right.
So, Will comes out of the bathroom.
We start getting into it.
I take the lead, because you know, I've done it 3 1/2 times.
- You're on my hair.
- Oh, sorry.
Mmm, you feel so-- - You're on my hair.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
- You just elbowed me in the eye.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Ok.
Just let me Oh!
Ok, that's it.
We're done with foreplay.
Come here.
Yeah.
Aah!
Stop!
Stop!
What?
Are you ok?
Yeah.
I---I think we should wait.
Noooo!
Why?
Are we ready?
This is a really big step, and I just-- I don't want to-- I want it to be right.
I don't want to rush into it.
Oh, my God.
Are you-- You are.
What?
I mean, I sort of suspected it.
I mean, it certainly would explain a lot of-- - Oh, no, no!
Oh, no!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's ok.
You don't have to feel bad.
My dad was one all through the army.
He-- What?
You're a virgin.
Virgin, yes.
No!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no.
I'm definitely not a virgin.
In fact, uh I've been known to be something of a lady man--Ladies man!
Ladies man.
Ha.
A man!
You know.
Yeah.
- Wellwell, then why are we waiting?
- Because.
But why?
Because I love you.
Oh, my God.
You are so sweet.
That's so like you to say it first.
I love you, too.
- Ok, I have to have you right now.
- Whoa!
No!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Hold--hold--hold!
- Didn't you hear me?
I--I--I love you.
- Yeah, yeah.
Love you, too.
Let's go.
- Grace, Grace!
- What?
just-- God!
I think we really, really should wait.
Oh, but why?
I mean, what are we doing?
- Are we waiting till we're married?
- Yes!
- Let's get married!
- What?
Let's get married and let's wait till we get married.
You want to get married?
Oh, my god!
Will.
Yes, I will marry you, Will Truman.
Well, great!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.
Grace, leave her alone.
She obviously doesn't want to talk.
It's my boyfriend, Tom.
I mean, I don't know what happened.
You know, just when things started to get kinda serious, he starts to pull away.
Which is so weird because we have so much in common, like, we're both dance majors This is Karen Walker.
This is Will Truman right here.
And this is your sorry ass future, if you don't dump that boyfriend of yours.
Oh, a-and you think everybody's gay.
No, not everybody, just me And you and a dog named Boo.
Hey, hey.
Heh.
I'm not gay.
Well, this well-worn copy of the "Dreamgirls" soundtrack begs to differ.
- What?
- We really, really should wait.
Oh, but why?
I mean, what are we doing?
- Are we waiting till we're married?
- Yes!
- Let's get married!
- What?
Let's get married and let's wait till we get married.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 7 Lows in the Mid-Eighties part2 synchro: kingo You asked Grace to marry you?
I panicked.
It was either that or have sex with her.
I mean, God!
Put yourself in my-- Ok.
Will, you know what I think your problem was?
I think you were afraid of loving yourself.
Where the hell did that come from?
Can you see me?
Anyway, the moment I said yes, he turned two shades of green and ran into the bathroom, which I found incredibly romantic, because my father did the exact same thing after he proposed to my mom.
So I'm in there for, like, 20 minutes.
So I come up with a perfect plan.
Grace, I've been-- I've been-- Grace?
I'm getting married in the morning ding dong, the bells are gonna chime, pull out the stopper, we'll have a whopper and get me to the shul on time.
- Will!
- Oh, there he is!
Congratulations!
Welcome to the family, son.
I want her knocked up by spring.
- Grace, we, uh, we need to talk.
- Congratulation.
- Thank you.
- I've been engaged twice.
Yeah.
- Grace - Will, come on, come on.
Meet everybody.
Meet the mishpokhe.
This is Aunt Ida, diabetic; Uncle Coppy, gambler.
Aunt Reba and Uncle Joe-- colitis, colitis.
If I could have one moment.
Oh, moment shmoment.
Give your new mother a big kiss right on the lips.
Wh-- yeah.
That was uncomfortable.
Now give your new sister a kiss right on the lips.
Here.
Hold this.
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Stop.
Stop.
Everybody stop.
- We need champagne.
More champagne.
- Yes.
I'll go.
Let me get that.
In fact We'll get that.
We'll get that.
When we get married, I'm not only gonna take your name, I'm gonna take your family, too.
I can't believe we're actually gonna do this.
Yeah.
Look, um I don't really know how to tell you this, so I'm just-- I'm just gonna tell you.
Um, you know before when I said I loved you?
I really, really meant that.
I do love you.
You're the best.
I can't imagine my life without you.
Well, now you never have to worry about that.
Yeah, well, actually, I I'm feeling a little lightheaded.
Um, see, there's this one teensy little complication Actually, not so teensy.
I-- - I'm gay.
- Are you hungry?
- What?
- What?
- I'm gay!
- Are you hungry?
!
- What?
!
- What?
!
- I'm g-- - Are you-- I'm gay.
Grace?
Hey, now.
Not exactly the reaction I was expecting.
You kill me.
Oh, my God.
Grace, I Oh, my God.
- Grace, I can-- - Oh, my God!
Grace When did you We're getting married.
Yeah, you know, I don't think I can go through with that, either.
I can't-- I don't even know-- How long have you known this?
I--I think on some level I've always known.
You know, I mean, the guy toweling himself off in the Zest commercial always did a little too much for me.
Oh, great.
Great.
- The Zest guy knew before me.
- No, no, no, no.
Listen.
That's not what I'm saying.
I don't think I really knew for sure until we were in bed together.
You know?
And I took one look at you in your sexy underwear, and I just went "Whoa.
I am gay".
You know?
I mean, do you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think I do.
- Yeah?
Just--just one thing.
Ow!
Hey!
Hey!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
You bastard!
I'm in love with you, and you're treating me like some sort of test drive?
!
You take me out for a spin, and you go, "Hmm, I don't really like the feel of this one.
I think I'd rather have a stick".
But Don't you see what a compliment that is?
I mean, I mean, I love you, so if I can't make it work with you, then it'll never work with any woman, because you're perfect for me.
That is not a compliment.
A compliment is "You're sexy, you turn me on," not "One look at you proves I'm a queer".
Look, I understand that you're upset, but I mean, this is-- this is a very big step for me, you know?
How about a little support here?
Well, you probably would've gotten a lot more support from me if you hadn't asked me to marry you first.
Ok.
In hindsight, not a good move.
Oh.
Hindsight?
Is that, like, one of your gay words?
What?
Look, I never meant to hurt you, but it's not like I planned to be gay.
I heard yelling.
Is everything ok?
What's going on?
- Nothing.
- Will's gay.
Oh, sweetie, oh.
- Julius, I owe you 20 bucks.
- Oh my God.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Will's gay.
Grace, you ruin everything!
Get out.
What?
I want you to get your things, and I want you to leave.
You know, I always knew this would be hard.
I--I guess I just hoped that because it was you, it wouldn't be the worst moment of my life.
Ok, so she threw you out?
Then what happened?
Well, then mother and I went to the DQ for some Brazier burgers and a Dilly Bar.
High fat?
High fun.
Not you, Dairy Queen.
She means us.
Yeah, what happened?
- Then, um - Then we didn't talk for a year.
Good times.
A whole year?
You didn't talk for a year?
What were you doing all that time?
I was instrumental in bringing Cats over from London.
Oh, not the musical.
Ethan Katz, a Jewish hottie from Piccadilly.
Oh, it's not me again?
Grace didn't really want to deal with me, and I had a lot of my own stuff to deal with, you know, like telling everyone in my life who I really was.
So, uh, have you been gay this whole time?
Pretty much.
Were you gay when you put that Coppertone on me in Fort Lauderdale?
Yeah.
Rob, I know what you're thinking, but I don't want you to worry.
You know, last night when you passed out And I made love to you, I was totally straight.
Then of course, I had to tell my mom and dad.
And then I had to tell everyone in my life.
How could I not have known?
He was Boy George for Halloween.
He has a diffuser on his blow-dryer.
And he's prettier than me.
Oh, baby.
This must be so hard for you.
It is.
I knew you'd understand.
For a guy to do that to you.
It's humiliating.
I would die.
I would just die.
You must not feel sexual Or pretty.
Then there's that gnawing question.
God, did I turn him gay?
- I mean, am I so gross that-- - Ok.
I get that you get it.
- Think you'll ever talk to Will again?
- Oh, no way.
People already think I'm weird 'cause of my haircut.
You add a gay friend to that, I might as well be a drama major.
Man, I was so pissed at you.
Pissed?
Honey, you don't know the meaning of the word.
If you'll remember, the last time we left the interesting story I had 3 different people dying to marry me, including a 9-time Wimbledon singles champion.
And I left them all behind to be with the man I love, and then it turns out The bastard's married.
Stan is married.
Can you believe that?
I had three different people dying to marry me, including a 6-time Wimbledon singles champion.
Oh, shut your trap, barfly.
What?
!
Who the hell are you?
Listen, Boozo the clown You're bringing us down.
If it was meant to be with this man, it was meant to be.
Huh?
Who asked you to pop your head out of your conch shell?
If I want advice, I'm not gonna ask for it from a cigarette-slinging, tray-carrying, mint wrangler.
- Listen, lady.
If there wasn't so many, I'd bang your head - You better watch your mouth or I'll make one phone call - and crack your head like a walnut.
- and get you on the next long boat to La Via de Los Tostadas.
- I like you.
Why don't you come work for me?
- Ok.
And although it was ten years before Stan and I officially hooked up, Rosario and I have been together ever since.
Damn it!
My story sucks, too.
Anyway A year goes by, Thanksgiving rolls around again, and then one night at D'Agostinos Should we do sweet potatoes or mashed?
Mashed, and I'm in love with you.
What?
Will, why are we pretending?
We spend every second together.
We call each other a hundred times a night.
I saw the way you were lookin' at me the other day when we were at that place shoppin' for shoes.
Look, Jack.
I owe you everything, you know?
I mean, this past year, coming out.
You've been like my sherpard through the Himalayas of Of him-a-laying.
But I just don't feel that way about you, you know?
I love you the way you love a cherished family pet.
That you never want to have sex with.
We're meant to be girlfriends, not boyfriends, you know?
It's better that way.
Brava.
You've passed the test.
I was worried your feelings might get in the way of our friendship, but I'm glad we've cleared that up.
I really had you goin' there with the "I'm in love with you thing," didn't I?
Yeah, you did.
Me, in love with you.
Me, in love with you?
Ha!
Craziness.
If you'll excuse me, I'll be in the frozen foods section.
It thought it'd be nice if we started Thanksgiving with some Jeno's eggrolls.
Will.
Grace, hi.
Hi.
How have you been?
Good.
Great.
I've been great.
You?
Great.
Great, uh, haven't seen you in months.
It's been a year.
I moved off campus.
Why'd you do that?
People kept writing "Grace plus Liberace" on my memo board.
You still mad at me?
I'm not mad at you.
I mean on some level I knew.
- You did?
- Yeah.
I mean, girls know.
I knew.
Well, if you knew, why didn't you tell me?
We could've saved ourselves a hell of a lot of-- I didn't really know.
I just swore that when I ran into you, I would say that.
You know, I left about a dozen messages.
And I wrote you a letter.
Did you get the letter?
- Wait a minute.
What was that?
- What?
That woman that you were hiding from.
What was that all about?
Well, the last thing he wanted to do was run into Diane.
Heh.
Yeah.
So, uh, then we, um We made up, and we have been best friends ever since.
Right, sweetie?
- Right.
- Well, you're all boring and I'm fun.
I better get back to the kids.
Smell you later.
Who's Diane?
You know, the girl Will slept with after you two broke up.
What?
You know, the kids will be fine.
I cracked a window in the limo.
You knew that.
You've told her.
You didn't know that?
You didn't tell her?
What-- What is he talking about?
Nothing.
It was this-- This girl-- Listen, it was nothing.
Anyway, best friends!
Huh?
Don't.
Will, don't--don't.
Grace.
Grace!
When I get home, I'm gonna rip your heart out through your foot.
Oh.
We should do this every year.
Are they coming back, because I still don't understand what this story has to do with me and Tom.
Oh, cripes.
Honey, let me give it to you in a nutshell.
Your boyfriend's a big flaming feather-wearing, man-kissing, disco-dancing Vermont-living, Christina Aguilera-loving, Mikanos-going-- Honey, take it on home.
- Tom's queer, dear.
- Merry Christmas!
Would you hang on, please?
Gracie!
- How come you didn't tell me?
- Because I thought it would upset you.
- Well, it did.
- Well, that's why I didn't tell you.
You're unbelievable.
15 years later, and you're still lying to me.
- Need a cab, miss?
- No.
- I was gonna get around to telling you.
- When?
- Right after you found out.
- That's not even funny.
- Why is this such a big deal?
- Because I thought that I was the one - that helped you come out.
- You were!
- I thought that I was the one that changed your life.
- You did!
I thought it was my naked body that did nothing for you!
It didn't!
It still doesn't!
- Don't try to make me feel better.
- Grace, come inside.
I don't want to come inside!
- Taxi?
- No!
After what happened with us, I--I was little percent hanging over me, so I I met this woman at a party, we got stinking drunk, went back to her room-- it was awful.
So it could have been awful with me.
Why didn't you make it awful with me?
Because I love you.
I cared about you.
I--I--I-- I didn't want to put you through that.
I needed to try it with someone I didn't love.
It was awful, huh?
Beyond awful.
Remember that nature special with the elephant seals flopping all over the place?
I needed to picture the cute guy that hosted that show just to make it through.
Ok, is this it?
Or are there any other sordid heterosexual stories I should know about?
I swear, like walking through the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant-- something I only needed to try once.
- Cab, lady?
- No!
God, it's amazing.
When you need one, you can never get one, - and then when you don't-- - Actually, you know, Grace, um it's raining and we're 40 blocks from home.
We--we did need one.
Taxi?
Come on.
So we ok?
We will be.
Are we ok?
We will be.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Hey, how was your date last night?
- Don't wanna talk about it.
- That bad?
- That good.
I don't get that.
I'm not jinxing it this time.
Every time I have a good first date, the second one sucks, and there is no third.
So, the only logical thing to do is not talk about it.
Very logical, Mr. Spock.
Date well and prosper.
- You're crazy.
- Fine.
Call me superstitious.
- Let's talk about your date.
- What?
And jinx it?
No thank you.
- We can mention their names, right?
- Absolutely not.
- Mark.
- Paul-- but that's it.
Fine.
Give any more details We're doomed.
But if you guessed-- But how could I possibly?
- Minty.
- Fresh breath?
Ding.
Huge.
- You said "first date"?
- Right.
- Vocabulary.
- Ding!
- Broad - Way?
No, not Broadway, you homo.
Broad shoulders.
Met mine at that party with Jack last week.
Ditto on the shoulders, and my larynx didn't shut down from his cologne, which is all I care about.
- So we didn't jinx anything, right?
- Course not.
Oh, boy.
Ok, gotta hurry.
I've got a dermatology appointment.
Are you gonna get a little botox, a little collagen?
No.
Just going for my regular mole patrol.
Why?
Do you think I need that?
No.
Morning, biscuits.
No time for host chat.
I got a hot date tonight.
Told him I was an ombudsman.
I only have 12 hours to figure out what the hell that is.
Grace, I came by to return your electric toothbrush.
You used my toothbrush?
Relax.
I didn't use it on my teeth.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 9 Three's a Crowd, Six is a Freak Show synchro: kingo This video game makes a nice birthday gift.
Do you think your stepson would like that?
I don't know, honey.
Can he eat it or rub up against it?
Let's come at this a different way.
What are his interests?
Ham.
- Why don't I just let you browse awhile?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Ooh, and, uh, do you think there's anything you could do about all these kids in here?
- Ma'am, it's a toy store.
- Yeah.
See what you can do.
Move it, shorty.
Hi, Karen.
Um I can't help you shop today.
I've gotta go.
Honey, what's going on?
What's happening?
What's with the geisha hand?
Nothing.
I just had something zapped at the dermatologist's, and it looks kinda funky, and I just don't want anyone to see it right now.
Grace, I'm sure it's not nearly as bad as you think it is.
It's probably nothing, a little dot.
Come on.
Show mama.
Shhhhh!
Karen, Will you calm down?
How do you expect me to calm down when I can see its heart beating right in front of me?
!
Alright.
Alright, I'm sorry.
So how long have you had the herpes?
It's not herpes.
It's not even herpes adjacent.
Oh, yeah?
Well, it's close enough to be invited to the herpes family picnic.
It was a weird freckle, and the doctor wanted to freeze it, and then he told me that it was going to take 10 days to heal.
I mean, what made him assume that I could look awful for 10 days?
Respond to that, and I will rub it all over your Prada.
What are you lookin' at, prego?
Haven't you ever seen herpes before?
Jeez.
Fat people are so insensitive.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Would you look at it in this little toy mirror?
It's gottenbigger.
It's like Barbie's dream zit.
Thank God I canceled my date with Mark.
Yeah, 'cause that thing looks like it needs orange cones and police tape around it.
Come on.
Let's get outta here-- And there's Mark!
I can't believe it!
One cheeseburger at Yom Kippur!
You'd think you could let it go already.
Hey, he's lookin' at baseball gloves.
What do you know, Grace?
You bagged a straight one.
Karen-- Karen, just don't move.
Just don't move.
Grace I told you, I only did this once in college, and it was just so I could borrow her Halston skirt.
Paul?
- Hi.
- Will, hi.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
What do you mean, what am I-- Aren't you here to see-- - No, I was here to see-- - Paul, you forgot your Look, uh, this is kinda awkward, but, uh, at that party I asked for both of your phone numbers.
I hope that's not a problem, because it's not a problem for me.
No.
Ok, Will, I'll see you Monday at the Plaza, and, Jack, I'll see you Tuesday at Shakey's.
All-you-can-eat.
Don't shake your head at me!
I called dibs on him at that party!
Jack, how am I supposed to keep track?
You call dibs on every guy you see.
Last week you called dibs on Kevin Bacon.
Le Bacon and I had a moment.
Some say "moment".
Some say "security incident".
- Anyway, Paul is into me.
- Oh, please!
He is so much more into me.
We had an 8-hour date, which I know is hard for you to understand, seeing as you have 8 dates an hour.
Yeah?
Well, date shmate.
We have a song.
What song?
You wouldn't know it.
Sing it.
Hee bop dee-bop bop, I love you.
Paul loves me, and not you.
Catchy little ditty.
Who does that song, the lady who pushes her shopping cart around the airport?
Actually, it's a new band called "Will is Fat".
It's from their new album, Will's Losing His Hair.
Do you?
I have it in my Jack Do you think when you insult me that you could try to be a little more artful, hmm?
You bucktoothed fairy?
- You know what?
!
I don't need that from you!
- Jack, jack, jack!
Let's not do this, ok?
I mean, we're both adults.
You're the adult.
Look, for the sake of our friendship, can we both just back off and not see Paul again?
But I love him.
You do not.
Maybe I'm just in love with love.
Maybe you're just an idiot.
Maybe - Can we agree we're not gonna see him again?
- Oh, all right.
But this is not gonna be easy for me, Will.
I mean, Paul is my world.
I can't stop thinking about him.
- Have you seen the latest Men's Health?
- Hello, Mrs. McFarland.
Grace?
Grace, where are you?
Is he gone?
Is he gone?
Oh, honey, no!
Children have been in there.
You're in a pit full of pinkeye.
This is ridiculous.
I mean, what's the worst thing that can happen?
He breaks up with me.
Well, if he's that superficial, then don't want to be with him anyway, right?
Well, I'm gonna go.
He's right over there.
I'm just gonna get the kid the same thing I got him last year: a diamond tennis bracelet.
It's pretty, isn't it?
Mark?
Hey.
Hey, Grace.
Uh, I was just picking up a Nerf hoop for my nephew, and by nephew, I mean me.
I thought you were out of town.
I lied to you.
I'm not taking a dozen underprivileged kids on a canoe trip.
I canceled because I was afraid to see you because I had this freckle frozen and it looks awful and I was afraid that if you saw it, you wouldn't like me anymore.
Well, that would make me pretty shallow, wouldn't it?
Grace, I had a great time with you.
I really like you.
Really?
'Cause I really like you.
Yeah, and besides, we all have little things on our bodies, right?
Right.
I mean, you probably have What?
A patch of dry skin somewhere A rogue belly hair I have six toes.
Beg your pardon?
You're breaking up with Mark already?
What are you talking about?
Few days ago, you were gaga over him.
You know how it is.
Sometimes you get bowled over by somebody--- Don't say "gaga"-- And then you get to know them, and you realize that maybe you don't like them so much.
Hey, Wilma.
Grace tell you she's dating a circus freak?
- What?
!
- Karen.
Yeah.
He's got six toes.
Wait!
What do you mean, like, total?
- Like three and three?
- No.
Five on one, half a dozen on the other.
Ok.
Hey, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!
- Cut it out!
- That's what he should do.
Ah!
I'm sorry.
I can't--I can't help it.
I'm totally creeped out by it in the same way that I'm creeped out by anything that ends in mini-teeth or mini-hair.
- Here comes the tumor thing.
- On the Discovery Channel, they found a tumor in this guy, and it had mini-teeth and mini-hair.
And when they poked it, the tumor went "Ow".
- It did not say, "Ow".
- Well, if it'd had mini-lips, it would've.
It moved.
That thing had emotions.
It had emotions, Will, and this toe thing is in that same category.
Aren't you being a little shallow?
I mean, you like this guy.
Look, when you first got that barnacle on your face, you wanted Mark to accept you, right?
Now shouldn't you do the same thing now that the shoe's on the other hideously deformed foot?
I'm serious.
You should go out with him again.
He is sweet.
Anyway, it could be worse.
You could be going out with the same guy as Jack.
Paul?
With the huge Vocabulary?
Yeah.
But it's over already.
We both decided to back off.
Which is very frustrating because he's called me, like, 10 times.
Well, then what are you doing?
- Backing off.
- Why?
- Because I owe it to Jack to-- - All you owe Jack is the truth.
He's your friend.
He wants you to be happy.
He'll totally understand.
You know what?
You're a piece of work, mister!
- I didn't wanna lie to you.
- Why not?
I wouldn't have done the same thing to you!
I mean time and time again-- Jack, please.
Please.
I know you're angry, but I beg of you.
Take it out of the head voice.
You're waking up every dog in the neighborhood.
How could you betray me like this?
We had a deal, and you stabbed me in the back.
Judas.
You're Judas.
This is exactly what he did!
Mmm Don't know that the big problem there was a gay love triangle.
Don't change the subject.
I can't believe you called him after we agreed to back off.
Actually, Jack, he-- He called me.
- I don't believe you!
- Eh, Jack!
Think of the dogs.
You know what?
You're a real piece of work, mister.
I can only imagine what kind of tricks you had to pull out of your man purse to convince Paul to date you.
What?
What?
What?
What did you tell him, you were a lawyer?
- I am a lawyer.
- Hey!
I'm not attracted to you, so that line's not gonna work on me.
You so don't care about my feelings, ever.
Jack, he called.
He said he rather go out with me.
I said, "Yes".
I'm sorry.
You know, it just doesn't make any sense, Will.
It's none-sense.
Why would he settle for a big bland piece of government cheese when he could take a bite out of a tasty smoked gouda with a trick jaw?
Maybe because I read novels rather than Tiger Beat Maybe because I can finish a sentence without the use of jazz hands Maybe because my frame of reference extends beyond boy bands and butt-robics, or maybe, just perhaps, it's because he sees a good long-term prospect with me rather than a good hour and a half with you.
- So what would you like to drink?
- Well, what have you got?
- Everything.
- Surprise me.
My dad's the Pope.
Surprised?
Ok, I'm charming.
I finally got to use that Pope joke.
This is going well.
I'm not so shallow.
Ooh, Grace, would it be ok if I caught the last few minutes of the Knicks/Celtics game?
Are you kidding?
I love basketball.
I read all of Dennis Rodman's books.
What are you doing?
Do you mind if I take off my shoes?
The right one always gets a little tight.
Not at all.
Make yourself comfortable.
And there's the toe.
There's now just a thin layer of argyle between it and me.
- Ow!
Ow!
Ow, my foot is cramping.
- Well, if you have to go home, I understand.
Actually, I was wondering if you could just Rub it?
Rub your tumor?
Sure.
What?
!
That is not a 3-pointer.
His toe is clearly over the line.
One toe over the line, sweet Jesus.
So for the whole flight, this annoying guy has been like, "When are we gonna get the muffins, huh?
Where's my muffin"?
So the stewardess finally brings the muffins, and the guy is so excited, he starts doing the Snoopy dance.
So he gets up to wash his hands, and I don't know what made me do it, but, um, I stole his muffin.
I thought his-- I thought his head was gonna explode.
"My muffin"!
Great story.
I can't see you anymore.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
My cramp's still there.
I'm gonna take my sock off.
Ok, brace yourself.
Here it comes.
Just stay calm.
You like this guy.
You're not shallow.
A little thing like this doesn't matter.
It's just an extra toe.
What you thinkin'?
That we need more drinks.
Excuse me.
Ok, you did it.
You saw it.
You lived through it.
Everything's fine.
Then why do I feel so cold and clammy?
Oh, right.
The fridge is still open.
See?
It's sitting there in your lap, and you're fine.
You're not superficial.
You're not a hypocrite.
Good for you, Grace.
Good for you.
Yes!
Ye-es!
The Celts win.
- What?
You're a Celtics fan?
- Huge.
Get out.
What?
Look, I can put up with a lot of things from people, but not that!
What?
Grace, are you kidding me?
I will not have a 6-toed Celtics fan in my house!
- A what?
- You heard me!
I will not have a Celtics fan in my house!
Please leave!
Oh, Grace, this isn't about the basketball game.
We know what this is about.
How shallow can you be?
Ok, fine.
I'm shallow.
But if you knew how much I liked you, you would know how much it is killing me to throw you out of here just because you have a toe where no toe should ever be.
How about a little sympathy for me?
Are you kidding me?
You want me to feel sorry for you?
No.
I want you to put your sock back on.
Ok, fine.
Oh, and, by the way, here's your freckle.
I almost tripped over it on my way to the elevator.
Good night.
Oh, yay.
I can wear lipstick again.
- Hey.
- Hi.
I've been calling you for two hours.
Why didn't you pick up?
- Um, look-- - I know.
I know.
You're still mad at me.
You'll be happy to know that Paul and I are no longer seeing each other.
I mean, the thing is, you know, I'm on this date, and he's funny, and he's charming, and I'm miserable because I can't stand that I hurt you.
So you see, I do care about how you feel.
That's sweet.
Thank you.
You know, I'm sorry we fought, too, and, hey, let's make a deal never to fight over a guy again.
- Deal.
- Ok.
Alright.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, hey, uh, Will Uh, you know I--I was bad, too And, Oh, boy, this is really hard for me to say.
I'll just I borrowed your stockpot-- - Who's out there?
- Nobody, Paul-- And I think I broke it.
- Is that Paul in there?
!
- Yeah.
- Jack?
- One sec, sugar!
Anyway I mean, you're probably better off without it.
You only used it to make cream-based soups, right?
Night.
You know what?
You're a piece of work, mister!
You know why this happened, don't you?
We jinxed it.
You're right.
We can never again talk about guys we like.
Never.
- I saw a cute guy takin' out the trash.
- There were some hotties at the restaurant.
- But we're not talking about it.
- No, we're not.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hang on!
Hang on.
Will, when you came out of the closet, you weren't supposed to take all of your clothes with you.
Help me!
What are you dressed for?
Open-heart surgery?
Will, admit it.
If you were straight, you'd be all over me.
Grace, if I was straight, you'd be getting the dry cleaning.
- So, your, uhtotal comes to 41 bucks.
- Oh, thanks.
I'll get ya next time.
- You said that last time.
- But I didn't mean it last time.
I mean it this time.
Funny, I believed you last time.
I don't believe you this time.
Oh--oh, ok, we're supposed to meet Joe and Larry in 15 minutes.
We should boogie.
Don't dance.
Don't say boogie.
Can you believe it?
They're getting married in four days.
I love weddings.
Well, it's not strictly a wedding; it's a same-sex civil union, which affords many of the same rights as a marriage.
Right.
Where are they going on their honeymoon?
Well, it's not strictly a honeymoon; it's a same-sex vacation with a lot of the same events as a honeymoon.
Hey, friends, lovers, mothers, and other strangers.
You're never going to believe what happened to me.
Oh, my gosh!
Did you see that?
I almost did the half nelson.
I almost bruised my delicates, my delicates, my domo arigato Mr. Tomatoes.
Huge news!
I have met-- Are you ready for this?
Mr. Right.
Well, Mr. Right-Now, anyway.
Ba-da-bum!
Good night, folks, I'm here all week.
Jack 2000!
He works over at the Jumpin' Java.
You know that coffee shop on 72nd?
And his name is Paul.
He is cute with a capital "Q"!
And the busier it gets, the hotter he gets.
And the hotter he gets, the sweatier he gets.
And the sweatier he gets-- I forgot where I'm going with this, but the point is Me likey he, and he likey me.
And the best part is--Shazam-- he gives me free iced coffee every time I go in, which is every hour on the hour.
Thank you very much!
And occasionally on the half hour!
Bah-da-da-da-da!
Blblblbt!
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 10 Coffee & Commitment synchro: kingo So I know we've shown you a thousand pictures of our baby, but how cute is Hannah with a pacifier in her mouth?
Oh, wow!
I actually took a similar photo of Jack But the--the photo place wouldn't develop it.
Will, switch with me.
- W-well, we got the same dessert.
- I know, but it's our thing.
- We always switch halfway through.
- But you're all the way through!
Just switch.
You guys are so cute together.
Are we?
Yeah, very!
Well, he's freaking out a little.
In four days, he's not allowed to look at another man.
Listen, we wanted to ask you guys if you would consider doing a reading together at our ceremony.
Oh, my god!
Oh!
Oh, I've got the perfect thing.
We did this bit at my parents' 40th anniversary w-with puppets and a boom box.
See, they were puppets who rapped.
It killed!
Do you remember?
It killed!
But--but a reading's good.
Well, we want to include everyone, and all our closest friends and family are doing one.
- Even your bitter sister.
- Larry!
Well, of course we'll do it.
We'd love to.
"Yo, yo, yo, this anniversary's phat"!
Remember?
It--I'm telling you, it--it-- Well, whatever you want.
- Uh-uh.
Our treat.
- Grace-- No, come on, come on, let us do this.
Really, I mean, this is a special occasion.
If we can't take our dear friends out for dinner-- Really, it would mean so much to us.
- Thank you, guys.
- Our pleasure.
- Put it on your Visa.
- Wh--?
- My Visa?
- Yeah, we could use the miles.
Oh, and I'm taking some cash for the coats.
I didn't get to the ATM.
Oh, and leave a big tip.
He was really sweet.
He's the only guy at this table who looked at my chest.
Hey, Jackie Brown.
Why isn't there any coffee?
!
Same reason you don't have a wife and three kids.
It's the way God wants it.
Damn it, this is an office!
There should be coffee!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Why don't you save your anger for the bedroom, where it belongs?
Why don't you go see your little coffee cutie, huh?
Your latte lover.
Mr. Jock-full-of-nuts.
He quit, all right?
What is this?
The freaking inquisition?
Can't a guy have a nice, hot cup of coffee when he wants, or do we all live in "Tea Land" where it's a capital crime to even say the word "coffee"?
Ok, jitterbug, get a hold of yourself.
Don't tell me to get a hold of myself.
I'm fine!
Ok, you may wanna take a look in the mirror because you got a little crazy on your face.
Ok?
Oh, my God.
Karen, what's happening to me?
Well, I'm no expert, but I think you have a little addiction problem.
No tears on the damask.
Addiction?
Oh, no.
No, no!
I don't have an addiction, thank you very much.
- Ok, ok.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
Now, listen to me.
The first thing you have to do is admit that you have a problem.
Because if you can't even recognize the signs Then you are really in sorry shape.
Why are you so good to me?
Karen, I can't do it.
I'm hooked on the junk.
Well, honey, if it'll help you, I'll do it with you, ok?
I'll kick coffee, too.
Yeah!
It won't be easy, but every morning when I wake up, I'll just have to get used to drinking my Bailey's straight.
It'll still be the best part of waking up.
Ok, Karen.
Ok.
Together we can do this.
Let me just have one last cup.
- No.
- Half a cup.
- No.
- How about you drink a cup and I'll lick your tongue?
- Tempting, but no.
Ok, come here.
Right here.
Oh, Karen, when will the lambs stop screaming?
Hey!
Oh!
Is this our gift for Joe and Larry?
- It's a gift, yes.
- What is it?
It's a crystal decanter.
But I couldn't find any paper, so I wrapped it in a kayak.
It's a kayak.
Oh, that is so perfect!
Ok, where's the card?
I'll sign it.
- I already signed the card.
- Oh, you didn't sign for me, did you?
Your handwriting has a serial killer's slant.
I didn't sign your name at all, Grace, because it's from me.
I don't get it.
I'm tired of being the one who pays.
What?
You always assume I'm gonna take care of everything, and then you take all the credit, I mean, not to mention the Advantage miles.
You know, blowing 20,000 points on a first class to Schenectady.
W-what is that anyway?
Y-you sit on the pilot's lap?
Jeez, sorry.
I thought you liked paying.
Oh, that's right!
I do like paying.
Yeah, that's why I do the cancan every time I read the gas bill.
Ok, you've made your point.
How much was the kayak?
I'll write you a check for half.
- $400.
- Can I write you a check for a third?
You see, this is what I'm talking about.
And it's not just the kayak.
It's the dinners, and the dry cleaning, and on more than one occasion, your bikini wax.
Had a fun time explaining that one to my accountant.
I cannot believe you are springing this on me an hour before we have to go.
How am I supposed to find a gift?
Hey, it's your own fault for assuming that I would take care of everything.
And by the way, you only have five minutes.
Fine!
You know what?
I'm resourceful.
I'll make a gift.
- You'll what?
- Yes, that's right.
You've left me absolutely no time, but I once threw togethera dinner party for eight with nothing in the fridge but mustard and a roll of film.
Yeah, and all we have to remember that evening is double prints of eight angry people getting sick eating mustard soup.
Never mind.
I'll take care of my own gift, and it'll be totally separate from yours.
In fact, why stop at the gift?
Why don't we make everything separate?
Why not?
That pint of mocha almond fudge, you still have it?
The what?
Hello, dark roast, my old friend.
Drop that spoon, Billie Holiday!
I've kept you caffeine-free for two hours.
You're not folding now!
Get away from me, you lamé and ermine-wearing monster!
- I'll drop it, I swear.
- No, you won't.
You don't have the guts!
You know me too well.
Out of my way!
I've got a monkey on my back named Juan Valdez!
Don't worry, kids.
On the ride up to Vermont, I'll have him in a dog carrier with a chew toy.
By the way, what's going on here?
I'm sensing a mood.
- He thinks I'm taking advantage of-- - Yeah, save it, honey.
We'll crack it open later when we're desperate.
It's so cold.
So very, very cold.
Yeah, it is kind of nippy in here.
Hey, pops, why don't you crank up the heat?
The girls are in full salute back here.
It's up as high as it will go.
God, any hotter and my calves'll be brisket.
Jack never has a second cup at home.
Somebody fill me to the rim with brim.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
How much for one mint?
- Oh, Grace, just take it.
- No, no, no, we agreed to split everything, so that's what we're gonna do.
These are your mints so tell me-- - Fine.
$100.
- Ok.
Hey, careful!
You almost broke my present for Joe and Larry.
Where did you get that anyway?
The Blair Witch gift shop?
It's an imprint of my hand in cement surrounded by a nest of twigs.
I made it when I was 12 at Camp Rema.
It's real, it's unique, and it's from the heart.
Aw, can I see that, honey?
- Thanks.
- Karen!
No!
What, you think my gift is funny?
I think it's funny you call it a gift.
We're here at New York's finest restaurant, and we've replaced Jack's coffee with nothing!
Oh, look at that.
Two miles to the next toll.
That means I owe you $1.62.
Ok, well, look, hey, if we're gonna do that, let's go all the way.
Uh, I bought a full tank of gas, you used three of my Kleenexes and two applications of my Carmex.
That means you owe me roughly $22.57.
Do you take a check or should I pay you in pettiness, Mr. Petty?
Tom Petty?
Petticoat petty?
Peppermint petty?
Bite me!
Ohh, just climb on top of each other and get it over with already!
Lord.
Honey, look, what is that?
Oh, it's a beaver.
Sweet!
Didn't think we'd be seeing any of those at a gay wedding.
- So how you holding up, sweetie?
- Pretty good, pretty good.
I--I think the last couple hours in the car really got me over the hump.
- Good for you.
- Thanks.
Hey, bow tie.
Bring me a cup of vodka.
And none of that tax-free swill.
I want the good stuff.
- Uh, ma'am, there is no alcohol.
- Sure there is.
Uh, no, there isn't.
This is a dry weeding at the groom's request, but there is a full coffee bar with a variety of coffee drinks and coffee-flavored treats.
Enjoy.
Would you look at this?
What a shame.
A table full of hollow gestures.
I mean, why would Joe and Larry want a $400 place setting of Italian dinnerware?
- Yeah - Oh, my God!
That's genius!
A gag gift!
They're gonna totally crack up.
What did you really get them?
A $400 kayak.
Put my name on that card or I'll kick your ass.
- No.
You have your gift.
- I can't give them this stupid twig plate.
It smells like mouse poop.
- Damn it, Will-- Hi!
- Hi guys!
- You look so good!
We're so happy for you.
- How's the blushing bride?
Oh, pretty good, you know, considering we don't know which one of us is the bride.
Hey, everyone, how are you?
Hi.
- Hey, did you give them the thing?
- It's right-- Because we have to be out of here by 11:00 on the dot.
And it's getting late and if we don't start soon-- Larry, baby, we're fine.
Just breathe.
It's our day.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I am telling you, if I didn't have this one Do you still wanna marry me?
Over and over and over.
He's definitely the bride.
Here's the reading, and it's pretty self-explanatory, but you might wanna go over it before we start, which is now.
Ok, that's what nervous feels like.
Come on, Grace, we better get our-- Grace!
- Come on, what's the big deal?
- Well, for one thing I don't think that "Joel and Shirley Goodman" are gonna be so keen on having your name on their card.
Second of all, I said no.
- Why are you being such a freak about this?
- I already told you.
- I told you that I would pay.
- Tough!
- Why?
- Because I don't want a wife!
What are you talking about?
Wife?
And don't you walk away from me when I'm talking to you!
Honey, we gotta bust out of here!
Maybe I can get Stan to land the heli by the gazebo and airlift us to the Dewar's plant.
- Karen, we have to at least stay for the ceremony.
- The hell we do!
I'm gonna kill Rosario!
The one morning she forgets to strap on my boot flask.
- Would you take it easy?
- Don't tell me to take it easy!
I'm looking at a room full of outlet clothing and Fantastic Sam's haircuts!
I can't breathe, I tell you, I can't breathe!
Would you get a hold of yourself?
Would either of you care for a cup coffee?
- Yes!
- No!
I'm your wife?
That is possibly the most vicious thing you have ever said to me.
And I'm including the time I got a root perm and you called me pubic head.
- Get a grip on yourself!
- You get a grip on yourself!
Look, the only way we're gonna get through this is if we support each other, all right?
Maybe you're right.
I guess we can get our minds off of things by touching each other inappropriately.
Good idea.
You might as well be my wife.
What?
"Marcus Welby's my wife"?
No!
You might as well be my wife, deaf-o.
I can't hear anything over that farkhakhte harp.
What a wonderful day, and what a wonderful couple.
It's always "Will and Grace".
Will and Grace buy the present.
Will and Grace do the speech.
"We cordially invite Will and Grace".
why don't they ever say "Will and guest"?
- Well, who did you want to bring?
- I don't know!
One of the Gap dancers, Aquaman, anyone!
- Well, who's stopping you?
- You are!
Because you're so content to play Mrs. Will Truman.
I want a husband.
I want someone who loves me, a-and a family.
I want this, not this!
I do not know where you got the idea that I am your wife, but let me tell you something, if that's true, we've got big martial problems because Mrs. Truman's getting a lot of action on the side.
And now I' like to call upon your friends here who have some words they'd like to share with you.
Jack?
Hi, I'm Jack, and I'm addicted to full-flavored iced coffee drinks.
Whew!
It does feel better to get it out.
No, zippy, read your thing!
Joe, Larry, I did a little rewrite.
I hope you don't mind.
Ahem.
Joe, Larry, what's love S'got to do, s'got to do with it?
- What's love-- - Thank you.
Now we'll hear from Joe's sister Jean.
I am so happy for my brother.
Everyone thought I'd be the first to find a man, but, no, that didn't happen.
But he has found true-- Heh!
Just give me a second.
I don't have to explain this to you, ok?
I just know this is not working.
Ok, got it.
You've made yourself passive-aggressively clear.
Call in the lawyers.
We're getting a divorce.
- Which I'm sure I'll pay for.
- Let it go!
Guys?
When I'm feeling like there's no love coming to me And I have no love to give When I'm feeling separated from the world And cut off from myself When I'm feeling annoyed by every little thing Because I'm not getting what I want I'll remember that there is an infinite amount of love available to me.
And I'll see it in you.
I'll remember that I am complete within myself So I'll never have to look to you to complete me.
And most of all, I'll remember that everything I really need I already have, and whatever I don't have will come to me when I'm ready to receive it.
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.
Me, too.
- I love you.
You know that, right?
- I know.
- Don't you?
- I do.
- And you know I love you, right?
- I do.
Thanks for coming!
Guys?
Hey, guys!
Guys!
We're not really done here.
Oh, they're beautiful.
Thank you, Maggie.
What do you think of the cake?
Are you kidding?
It's got nine layers of chocolate and a Snickers bar in the middle.
I may move into it.
So are we-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just Chalk it up to my pre-mid-life crisis.
Does that mean another one's on the way?
And is it going to be worse?
I guess weddings just bring out the worst in me.
I mean, I see them so happy and in love and it just Makes me bitter.
Is that an awful thing to say?
I wouldn't put it in your toast later.
You know that someday you are gonna make someone a beautiful bride or husband.
Or brusband.
Whatever.
- Promise you'll give me away?
- Gladly.
"To Joe and Larry, love, Will and Grace".
Thank you!
I knew you'd love it!
I mean, he's my younger brother.
I should be the one wearing white today.
Or at the very least deodorant.
Guess what?
Rule number one at a wedding-- Find a sad sister, you found the booze.
I myself am proud to say that I'm not going to indulge.
- You know, I've finally kicked my coffee habit.
- Really?
Yeah, I mean, I got hooked on the stuff because of some guy.
Now I know I'm not going to let any man lead me down that dirty road again.
- Excuse me, do you have a light?
- Uh, yes, I do.
- Thanks.
You smoke?
- Yes, I do.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Well, hello, Miss Crept-in-at-3:00-A.M.-slept-in-her-dress.
Somebody obviously ended the evening with a bang.
No, just a little French kissing.
Oh, what?
With that guy who kept going around the party saying, "it's all good".
No.
He bugged the crap out of me.
He kept asking me why I wouldn't smile I finally had to tell him it was because I was born without smiling muscles like that kid in Wisconsin.
That's good.
I once told someone I couldn't have sex with them because cause Jupiter was in my rising house.
I know It was me.
You lie a lot, you know that?
You are a very big liar, Grace Adler.
I am not.
I never lie.
Could you sign my doctor's name on this?
I'm trying to get out of jury duty.
Come on.
Come on, sign it.
He gave me some stationery and told me I could write whatever I want on it.
"Borderline personality disorder"?
"High-risk for psychotic break, particularly in a stressful situation".
You left out your tendency to not flush if it's just pee.
You are a disgrace, Margaret Truman!
A disgrace.
Don't think that we didn't see you and your big forehead sneaking out of that party last night.
Please.
It was boring, and then some three-foot-tall guy kept following me around begging me to come back to his apartment to show me his Lion King memorabilia.
When's the last time some guy offered to show you his Pumbaa?
You can't exactly afford to be choosy.
Even Grace was smooching that loser all night who kept saying, "it's all good".
- I thought you said - I lied.
I am telling you, you're gonna blink and you'll be 80 and alone in a caftan with a lap full of catnip saying "Here, kitty, kitty, kitty".
It's time to put the "sex" back in "homosexual," Will!
So get a freakin' boyfriend!
P.S., I ruined your new shirt, let's see a movie later!
- Don't listen to him.
- Why not?
He's right.
I have no one in my life, and why?
Because there's no one I'm interested in.
Oh, now, that's a lie.
You're the liar, Will, not me.
Oh, God, that's what hurts.
What about that cutie that you met at Banana Republic?
The guy whose card you've been dating for the last two months?
What are you What card?
Matt's card.
No, I don't think it's gonna work out, anyway.
He's kinda square.
You get it?
He's kinda No wonder I'm alone.
- Call him.
- I can't.
- Give me one good reason.
- Because he's a sportswriter.
He writes about sports.
- That is a good reason.
- Thank you.
Wait a minute What are you What are you saying?
That I couldn't go out with a sports guy?
God, no.
Better you stick to dating his card.
In fact, I just got a new Texaco card.
Maybe we could double.
- I'm gonna call him.
- I think it's a bad idea.
- Well, I'm doing it.
- I wouldn't.
You just totally manipulated me into that, didn't you?
It's all good.
Grace, we have a favor to ask you.
As you know, I recently acquired a prime piece of real estate in the greater Manhattan area.
- I gave you my apartment.
- Whatever.
Anyway, my fair-bosom friend here has generously offered to foot the bill to redecorate my little pomme de terre.
I see where this is going.
We were hoping you would.
And since this is your area of expertise And we really need a good designer We were hoping God, this is kind of hard to ask.
Do you know any?
Why isn't she speaking?
She's thinking.
Quick, grab a pencil.
Be ready to write down whatever she says.
She's not saying nothing.
That's because she's hypnotized by her own dress.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why don't we ask Grace to do it?
Is she any good?
Boris, Natasha, I'm right here.
Excuse me.
We're having a private conversation.
Nosy parker.
Speaking of which, I'd love to park my nosey in that scarf of yours.
Do it quick.
So, will you do it?
I wouldn't do it if you paid me twice my fee.
- How about if I pay you twice your fee?
- I'll do it.
So, what took you so long to call me?
That's sort of my style.
I like to wait, you know until the guy has lost all interest in or memory of me, and then I strike.
Well, it worked for me.
Look, they're showing last year's all-star game.
Pedro Martinez is the best pitcher in baseball, don't you think?
Don't tell me you're a Johnson fan?
I'm a big Johnson fan.
You want another beer?
Yeah, two more, please.
Sorry.
I love sports.
I always wanted to be a sportscaster.
When I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Howard Cosell.
That's funny.
You know, when I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Eartha Kitt.
But, you know, you should pursue it.
You'd be great.
Well, actually, I've got a meeting next week for an on-air position at Channel 9.
That's great.
Yeah.
I just love that you're into this.
The last guy I dated hated sports.
You know, since you're a baseball fan, you should join my buddies and me.
We get a game going every Saturday in the park.
You interested?
Absolutely.
I-I-I-- You know, I miss playing.
- What's your position?
- I'm for it.
Now, since we're dealing with limited space I thought we would play off that and go big, overstuff it but not excessively, smartly.
I like it.
Let's go exactly the opposite.
So you want to understuff it stupidly?
See God in everyone.
I've taken the liberty to pull some pictures from magazines to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.
These are pictures from an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog of men lying around with their underwear half off their asses.
Can you do that?
Jack, do I have to explain the difference between a decorator and a pimp again?
There you are.
I just got the estimate for the job, and let me tell you something no one takes advantage of Karen Walker Except Stan Walker, and at least he has the courtesy to kiss me and buy me jewelry before he gives me the low, soft one.
You said that money was no object.
Honey, that's just a saying, like, "Ooh, that sounds like fun" or, "I love you".
Listen Listen, Stan got wind of this, and he's taking the money out of my shoe allowance so I was hoping you could do the whole thing for, say, under $300 dollars.
Are you insane?
Jack's got expensive taste The musical bidet alone is over 400.
Well, that's your problem, not mine.
Just strip it down to the bare essentials Rubber walls, a baby-oil dispenser and a coatrack.
Paprika!
I've got it!
A skylight.
Jack, we have already gone over this.
You cannot put a skylight on the ninth floor of a 12-story building.
Karen, I can't work like this!
You can't work like this?
You know, I'm the one Oh!
God!
Honey, look.
She left her datebook.
- Let's look through it.
- And change things.
What is this?
It's a letter from her therapist.
I feel bad reading it.
I know.
It's terrible.
Move your hand.
I can't see.
"Personality disorder".
"Job-related stress".
"Prone to aggressive outbursts".
She's a psycho!
- What are you doing?
- Watching the Knicks game.
Why?
Did they get new cute boy cheerleaders?
I'm allowed to watch sports, ok?
Cause I'm a guy.
That's what guys do.
Now get me a beer.
Who am I kidding?
I want a spritzer.
I'll never pull this off.
What is happening to you?
I told Matt that I'm sports nut that I love watching sports, that I particularly love playing baseball and that I'm really good at it.
How quick can you get out of town?
What should I do?
I mean, do you think I can fake my way through this?
I'd say no.
Where is my paper?
Mr. Zamir.
Mr. Zamir!
I didn't take your paper.
How did you know that's what I was gonna ask you about?
Every day, I tell you I didn't take your paper.
And every day, you take it.
You got me there.
I want my paper!
Now throw that garbage away.
- God, the flies are just everywhere.
- Those are not my flies.
I always knew Grace was a little But I never knew she was My mother's crazy.
That's why I had her committed.
Well She's not crazy so much as she just bugged me.
She's a bitch.
I'm telling you, Karen, I'm worried.
I was watching "Justice Files" last night And they said that 90% of assaults are committed by someone you know.
Would you?
- Maybe.
- Me, too.
But Grace?
I mean, come on.
She doesn't even have one personality, let alone six or seven.
Give me my frickin' paper, you hairy little thief!
You think you're gonna get away with this, but you're not.
I'm onto you!
You're history!
It's over!
Oh, God!
Get away from me!
Guys?
What is wrong with you?
All right, let me ask you.
You said that you wanted mirrored floors.
I'm not sure I can make that work.
But when I'm doing jumping jacks, I like to look at my Yeah, mirrors-- Mirrors are bad.
Bad.
I'll just look at my reflection in a steak knife.
If I had one, which I don't.
There are no knives in here.
What's going on?
Gee, honey, you look real pretty today.
Maybe sometime I could borrow your little kitty shirt?
you guys are creeping me out, so I'm just gonna Damn it!
Get!
Quit!
All right, I'm just gonna go and work on my sketches, and then I'm gonna There's my datebook.
I thought that Will took it to work with him.
I was gonna kill him.
But you have it now, so no one has to die, right?
I love it.
That's perfect.
Act crazy, they'll let you decorate any way you want.
You know, it's so diabolical, you know, which makes everything better.
You know the question is what kind of crazy should you be?
You know, you could You could be like Barbra Streisand in Nuts.
But No Crazy people never have French tips or $600 highlights.
Or Sybil was very effective.
You know, "The people.
The people.
The people".
But I think you want to be more like Francis.
Hit the freakin' ball, you damn sissy!
Excuse me, Grace, that's not exactly helpful.
You know, in fact, I think I've improved quite a bit today.
No, you haven't.
You suck!
Your bat hasn't even connected with the ball once!
Yeah, but since you told me not to stand on the plate, the ball hasn't hit me once.
If you want to make Matt think you're some kind of ball player you gotta focus, be tough, attack the ball.
Here, let me show you.
Come on.
Weight on the back leg Feet shoulder-width apart Elbow up Eye on the ball I think I got it.
Let me try now.
No, trust me.
You don't have it yet.
Why don't you run off and get me a little corn dog and some nachos.
See that?
A blister from the batting cage.
You're looking at my very first sports injury.
Not counting the time that I got a groin pull reaching for a pair of sneaker clogs at Foot Locker.
I am so proud of you.
I know you were embarrassed when we had to move to the kiddie area but you felt like a man when the ball hit the clown, didn't you?
He went down.
I've got to get to Jack's.
I've got this bit where I kiss the wall and hum.
It freaks them out, and I love it.
Do you ever not look gorgeous?
God Ten years ago, I would have wasted so much time liking you.
Guess what?
- You got the Channel 9 job.
- I got it!
I got the job!
- I'm so happy for you!
- I'm a sportscaster, Will.
Next week, I'm gonna start doing sideline reporting.
I'll be like a Jeremy Schaap or a Sal Palantonio.
You know what I like to do when something good happens to me?
Something athletic.
Like Why don't we go to the batting cages, hit a few?
Oh, better idea.
Let's play some basketball.
Here it is.
What do you think?
Oh, my God!
I've changed my mind.
My dream home is no longer Jeannie's bottle.
It's this.
Here's the check for what I owe you, and just FYI from now on at work, I'm gonna bring a nurse with enough Thorazine to stop a charging elephant, ok?
Do you know why I'm laughing?
Someone in your head said something funny?
'Cause I tricked you.
That letter from my shrink I wrote it To get out of jury duty.
And once I knew that you knew I knew that I could use it to get what I wanted.
- Oh, aren't you something?
- A smarty So you see, I'm not really crazy.
Actually, I'm kinda brilliant.
Yeah, anything you say, honey.
Damn it!
Why did I waste all that mace on Rosario?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm not crazy.
- It was just an act.
- Oh, my God!
She's got an ax!
Act!
It was an act!
I am not crazy.
I'm not crazy!
God!
How many That was pretty good.
- I was a little rusty at first - But then you warmed up and you just plain sucked.
Hey!
That's not fair.
I beat that one guy.
- He was four.
- He was seven if he was a day.
Why are you doing this?
You hated every minute of it.
Are you kidding me?
I mean, the the balls and the dribbling and the the beautiful hardwood floors.
Ok, basketball's not my game.
I kind of suspected that when I suggested a game of Horse and you got down on all fours.
I knew that sounded too good to be true.
You don't have to pretend to like sports for me.
Yes, I do.
It's why you broke up with your last boyfriend, isn't it?
Do you really think I'm that shallow?
I broke up with him because he was poor.
I'm kidding!
I'm kidding.
We were just different.
I like foreign movies.
He liked foreign men.
God, I wish you'd told me that sooner.
I spent eight hours in the batting cage when I could have been home watching the All-American Cheerleader finals.
- Penn State won.
Of course they did.
They have Gigi Vandecourt and Cami Sewell.
So, no more lies?
- We'll be honest with each other?
- Deal.
Head's up.
Here comes the kid you beat.
Try not to rub it in Thanks for letting me win.
You know, I might have won on my own.
Yeah, in your dreams.

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Well, hello, Miss Crept-in-at-3:00-A.M.-slept-in-her-dress.
Somebody obviously ended the evening with a bang.
No, just a little French kissing.
Oh, what?
With that guy who kept going around the party saying, "it's all good".
No.
He bugged the crap out of me.
He kept asking me why I wouldn't smile I finally had to tell him it was because I was born without smiling muscles like that kid in Wisconsin.
That's good.
I once told someone I couldn't have sex with them because cause Jupiter was in my rising house.
I know It was me.
You lie a lot, you know that?
You are a very big liar, Grace Adler.
I am not.
I never lie.
Could you sign my doctor's name on this?
I'm trying to get out of jury duty.
Come on.
Come on, sign it.
He gave me some stationery and told me I could write whatever I want on it.
"Borderline personality disorder"?
"High-risk for psychotic break, particularly in a stressful situation".
You left out your tendency to not flush if it's just pee.
You are a disgrace, Margaret Truman!
A disgrace.
Don't think that we didn't see you and your big forehead sneaking out of that party last night.
Please.
It was boring, and then some three-foot-tall guy kept following me around begging me to come back to his apartment to show me his Lion King memorabilia.
When's the last time some guy offered to show you his Pumbaa?
You can't exactly afford to be choosy.
Even Grace was smooching that loser all night who kept saying, "it's all good".
- I thought you said - I lied.
I am telling you, you're gonna blink and you'll be 80 and alone in a caftan with a lap full of catnip saying "Here, kitty, kitty, kitty".
It's time to put the "sex" back in "homosexual," Will!
So get a freakin' boyfriend!
P.S., I ruined your new shirt, let's see a movie later!
- Don't listen to him.
- Why not?
He's right.
I have no one in my life, and why?
Because there's no one I'm interested in.
Oh, now, that's a lie.
You're the liar, Will, not me.
Oh, God, that's what hurts.
What about that cutie that you met at Banana Republic?
The guy whose card you've been dating for the last two months?
What are you What card?
Matt's card.
No, I don't think it's gonna work out, anyway.
He's kinda square.
You get it?
He's kinda No wonder I'm alone.
- Call him.
- I can't.
- Give me one good reason.
- Because he's a sportswriter.
He writes about sports.
- That is a good reason.
- Thank you.
Wait a minute What are you What are you saying?
That I couldn't go out with a sports guy?
God, no.
Better you stick to dating his card.
In fact, I just got a new Texaco card.
Maybe we could double.
- I'm gonna call him.
- I think it's a bad idea.
- Well, I'm doing it.
- I wouldn't.
You just totally manipulated me into that, didn't you?
It's all good.
Grace, we have a favor to ask you.
As you know, I recently acquired a prime piece of real estate in the greater Manhattan area.
- I gave you my apartment.
- Whatever.
Anyway, my fair-bosom friend here has generously offered to foot the bill to redecorate my little pomme de terre.
I see where this is going.
We were hoping you would.
And since this is your area of expertise And we really need a good designer We were hoping God, this is kind of hard to ask.
Do you know any?
Why isn't she speaking?
She's thinking.
Quick, grab a pencil.
Be ready to write down whatever she says.
She's not saying nothing.
That's because she's hypnotized by her own dress.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Why don't we ask Grace to do it?
Is she any good?
Boris, Natasha, I'm right here.
Excuse me.
We're having a private conversation.
Nosy parker.
Speaking of which, I'd love to park my nosey in that scarf of yours.
Do it quick.
So, will you do it?
I wouldn't do it if you paid me twice my fee.
- How about if I pay you twice your fee?
- I'll do it.
So, what took you so long to call me?
That's sort of my style.
I like to wait, you know until the guy has lost all interest in or memory of me, and then I strike.
Well, it worked for me.
Look, they're showing last year's all-star game.
Pedro Martinez is the best pitcher in baseball, don't you think?
Don't tell me you're a Johnson fan?
I'm a big Johnson fan.
You want another beer?
Yeah, two more, please.
Sorry.
I love sports.
I always wanted to be a sportscaster.
When I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Howard Cosell.
That's funny.
You know, when I was a kid I used to hold my mother's curling iron and pretend I was Eartha Kitt.
But, you know, you should pursue it.
You'd be great.
Well, actually, I've got a meeting next week for an on-air position at Channel 9.
That's great.
Yeah.
I just love that you're into this.
The last guy I dated hated sports.
You know, since you're a baseball fan, you should join my buddies and me.
We get a game going every Saturday in the park.
You interested?
Absolutely.
I-I-I-- You know, I miss playing.
- What's your position?
- I'm for it.
Now, since we're dealing with limited space I thought we would play off that and go big, overstuff it but not excessively, smartly.
I like it.
Let's go exactly the opposite.
So you want to understuff it stupidly?
See God in everyone.
I've taken the liberty to pull some pictures from magazines to give you an idea of what I'm looking for.
These are pictures from an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog of men lying around with their underwear half off their asses.
Can you do that?
Jack, do I have to explain the difference between a decorator and a pimp again?
There you are.
I just got the estimate for the job, and let me tell you something no one takes advantage of Karen Walker Except Stan Walker, and at least he has the courtesy to kiss me and buy me jewelry before he gives me the low, soft one.
You said that money was no object.
Honey, that's just a saying, like, "Ooh, that sounds like fun" or, "I love you".
Listen Listen, Stan got wind of this, and he's taking the money out of my shoe allowance so I was hoping you could do the whole thing for, say, under $300 dollars.
Are you insane?
Jack's got expensive taste The musical bidet alone is over 400.
Well, that's your problem, not mine.
Just strip it down to the bare essentials Rubber walls, a baby-oil dispenser and a coatrack.
Paprika!
I've got it!
A skylight.
Jack, we have already gone over this.
You cannot put a skylight on the ninth floor of a 12-story building.
Karen, I can't work like this!
You can't work like this?
You know, I'm the one Oh!
God!
Honey, look.
She left her datebook.
- Let's look through it.
- And change things.
What is this?
It's a letter from her therapist.
I feel bad reading it.
I know.
It's terrible.
Move your hand.
I can't see.
"Personality disorder".
"Job-related stress".
"Prone to aggressive outbursts".
She's a psycho!
- What are you doing?
- Watching the Knicks game.
Why?
Did they get new cute boy cheerleaders?
I'm allowed to watch sports, ok?
Cause I'm a guy.
That's what guys do.
Now get me a beer.
Who am I kidding?
I want a spritzer.
I'll never pull this off.
What is happening to you?
I told Matt that I'm sports nut that I love watching sports, that I particularly love playing baseball and that I'm really good at it.
How quick can you get out of town?
What should I do?
I mean, do you think I can fake my way through this?
I'd say no.
Where is my paper?
Mr. Zamir.
Mr. Zamir!
I didn't take your paper.
How did you know that's what I was gonna ask you about?
Every day, I tell you I didn't take your paper.
And every day, you take it.
You got me there.
I want my paper!
Now throw that garbage away.
- God, the flies are just everywhere.
- Those are not my flies.
I always knew Grace was a little But I never knew she was My mother's crazy.
That's why I had her committed.
Well She's not crazy so much as she just bugged me.
She's a bitch.
I'm telling you, Karen, I'm worried.
I was watching "Justice Files" last night And they said that 90% of assaults are committed by someone you know.
Would you?
- Maybe.
- Me, too.
But Grace?
I mean, come on.
She doesn't even have one personality, let alone six or seven.
Give me my frickin' paper, you hairy little thief!
You think you're gonna get away with this, but you're not.
I'm onto you!
You're history!
It's over!
Oh, God!
Get away from me!
Guys?
What is wrong with you?
All right, let me ask you.
You said that you wanted mirrored floors.
I'm not sure I can make that work.
But when I'm doing jumping jacks, I like to look at my Yeah, mirrors-- Mirrors are bad.
Bad.
I'll just look at my reflection in a steak knife.
If I had one, which I don't.
There are no knives in here.
What's going on?
Gee, honey, you look real pretty today.
Maybe sometime I could borrow your little kitty shirt?
you guys are creeping me out, so I'm just gonna Damn it!
Get!
Quit!
All right, I'm just gonna go and work on my sketches, and then I'm gonna There's my datebook.
I thought that Will took it to work with him.
I was gonna kill him.
But you have it now, so no one has to die, right?
I love it.
That's perfect.
Act crazy, they'll let you decorate any way you want.
You know, it's so diabolical, you know, which makes everything better.
You know the question is what kind of crazy should you be?
You know, you could You could be like Barbra Streisand in Nuts.
But No Crazy people never have French tips or $600 highlights.
Or Sybil was very effective.
You know, "The people.
The people.
The people".
But I think you want to be more like Francis.
Hit the freakin' ball, you damn sissy!
Excuse me, Grace, that's not exactly helpful.
You know, in fact, I think I've improved quite a bit today.
No, you haven't.
You suck!
Your bat hasn't even connected with the ball once!
Yeah, but since you told me not to stand on the plate, the ball hasn't hit me once.
If you want to make Matt think you're some kind of ball player you gotta focus, be tough, attack the ball.
Here, let me show you.
Come on.
Weight on the back leg Feet shoulder-width apart Elbow up Eye on the ball I think I got it.
Let me try now.
No, trust me.
You don't have it yet.
Why don't you run off and get me a little corn dog and some nachos.
See that?
A blister from the batting cage.
You're looking at my very first sports injury.
Not counting the time that I got a groin pull reaching for a pair of sneaker clogs at Foot Locker.
I am so proud of you.
I know you were embarrassed when we had to move to the kiddie area but you felt like a man when the ball hit the clown, didn't you?
He went down.
I've got to get to Jack's.
I've got this bit where I kiss the wall and hum.
It freaks them out, and I love it.
Do you ever not look gorgeous?
God Ten years ago, I would have wasted so much time liking you.
Guess what?
- You got the Channel 9 job.
- I got it!
I got the job!
- I'm so happy for you!
- I'm a sportscaster, Will.
Next week, I'm gonna start doing sideline reporting.
I'll be like a Jeremy Schaap or a Sal Palantonio.
You know what I like to do when something good happens to me?
Something athletic.
Like Why don't we go to the batting cages, hit a few?
Oh, better idea.
Let's play some basketball.
Here it is.
What do you think?
Oh, my God!
I've changed my mind.
My dream home is no longer Jeannie's bottle.
It's this.
Here's the check for what I owe you, and just FYI from now on at work, I'm gonna bring a nurse with enough Thorazine to stop a charging elephant, ok?
Do you know why I'm laughing?
Someone in your head said something funny?
'Cause I tricked you.
That letter from my shrink I wrote it To get out of jury duty.
And once I knew that you knew I knew that I could use it to get what I wanted.
- Oh, aren't you something?
- A smarty So you see, I'm not really crazy.
Actually, I'm kinda brilliant.
Yeah, anything you say, honey.
Damn it!
Why did I waste all that mace on Rosario?
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'm not crazy.
- It was just an act.
- Oh, my God!
She's got an ax!
Act!
It was an act!
I am not crazy.
I'm not crazy!
God!
How many That was pretty good.
- I was a little rusty at first - But then you warmed up and you just plain sucked.
Hey!
That's not fair.
I beat that one guy.

- He was seven if he was a day.
Why are you doing this?
You hated every minute of it.

I broke up with him because he was poor.
I'm kidding!
I'm kidding.
We were just different.
I like foreign movies.
He liked foreign men.
God, I wish you'd told me that sooner.
I spent eight hours in the batting cage when I could have been home watching the All-American Cheerleader finals.
- Penn State won.
Of course they did.
They have Gigi Vandecourt and Cami Sewell.
So, no more lies?

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I don't understand this.
I mean, what's going on right now?
What exactly are we watching?
This would be called a basketball game.
And where is this all taking place?
That's Madison Square Garden.
That's a sports auditorium now?
It's the world's most famous sports arena.
But I can see how that fact may have eluded you given that your entire knowledge of sports consists of giggling every time you hear the word "balls".
- Gets me every time.
- I know.
Oh, sorry I'm late.
There was this homeless guy who wanted money, but I thought he's just gonna spend it on booze, so I took him to the Korean market and told him, "Ok, you can get up to, like two pounds of salad," but then I thought, "Who am I to tell him he shouldn't have booze"?
So I took him to the liquor store and got him two pounds of malt liquor.
- Was that true?
- Saks had a shoe sale.
See, Grace, not only do your lies have too much detail, they're also socially irresponsible.
Look Buckles.
Grace, check it out.
This is amazing.
Tall, muscular lovelies in nothing but short-shorts and matching tank tops.
Why would straight guys watch this?
If I knew why straight guy did anything, do you think I'd be hanging out with you two homos.
- Have you seen Matt yet?
- Yeah, he's right there.
Right on the sidelines.
About four clicks west of Spike Lee.
Just right beside that little girl and her grandpa.
Uh, that's Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas.
- Matt looks good on TV.
- Doesn't he?
That's my man My squeeze My steady fella.
No wonder I was alone for so long.
Ring.
Hello?
What's that?
I'm bored?
Yeah, thanks for calling.
Bye-bye.
Will & Grace Season 3 - Episode 14 Brothers, a Love Story sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey.
Hey.
Uh, great game tonight.
You were-- You were really something out there.
You gave 110%.
You know, and I mean-- Wow!
- You were just jumping so high.
- I'm the towel boy.
Well, you--you look dry.
And in spite of tonight's loss, there's still a good chance this team will make the playoffs, providing all the other teams in the league get swallowed by a giant fish.
It's Matt Moshea reporting live from the visitors' locker room.
Great, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
- Hey, TV person.
- Hey, you.
I thought I'd come down to surprise you.
Congratulations.
You did -- and you looked -- great.
I don't care about that.
How great?
Really great.
So what do you think of my office?
What's not to like?
You're surrounded by naked men with an average shoe size of 17.
It'spretty good.
- How about a little-- a little dinner?
- Mmm, I'd love that.
- Hey, Matt!
- Harry, hey!
What are you doing here?
Checking out the naked guys in the locker room.
I saw the feed.
I wanted to let you know you did ok.
Uh, oh, about the fish joke at the end-- - Ha ha!
Yeah?
- Lose it.
- People want to laugh, let 'em watch the weather.
- Ok, no fish humor.
- I'm Will.
- Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.
- This is Harry Zalen, station manager-- my boss.
- Oh.
Hi.
- Who are you?
- I'm, uh, Matt's..
Brother.
Will's my brother.
Karen, I've had an awakening.
There are certain things in this world that desperately need changing, and I am committing every fiber of my being to changing them.
As we speak, there is a gun-control rally going on in Times Square, and I say let's join our brothers and sisters in fighting the good fight.
- Nah.
- All right.
Let's go to lunch.
Can't, honey.
I'm busy.
What you doing?
Oh, just doing a little last-minute shopping for the step-kiddies.
Honey Do you think Mason will like this?
I don't know.
Does he need steak knives?
Oh, honey, if you'd ever seen him work his way through a porterhouse, you wouldn't be asking that question.
So what's the gift for, anyway?
What do you mean, Jack?
Christmas?
Hello?
!
Deck the halls with boughs of money, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la Karen, Christmas was months ago.
Don't you remember?
That was the day you let Rosario call her kids.
God, I mean, when's the last time you checked your calendar?
Well, I don't need a calendar.
When my pills run out, I just go back to Pharmacist.
- But did I miss anything good?
- No, not too much.
New Year's Martin Luther King Day "Pick Stan up from the hospital".
Oh, that's where he is.
And that brings us back to today.
Oh!
Kare!
The Black-and-White Ball's this weekend.
Balls.
Is it time for that again already?
Oh, I hate these formal affairs, honey.
Everybody's gonna be there.
Mr. And Mrs. Marlo Thomas, Mr. And Mrs. Connie Chung, Mr. And Mrs. Hilary Clinton.
Looks like you're gonna have to call out the big guns.
Yeah.
Bang!
Bang!
You're supposed to let me blow.
Ok, honey.
Get ready.
Bang!
Bang!
Ooh, listen.
How about you come with me tomorrow morning to the safe deposit box and help me pick out my jewels, ok?
I'll bring the truffles and the chardonnay, and you bring that tight little butt of yours!
I love it!
Ok, Karen, we've got a crazy work day ahead.
I've got back-to-back clients coming in, an installation at 2:00, and there's a ton of Xeroxing and faxing that has to happen, so in order to get any of that done I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
You're the boss.
I am so upset right now, I--I can't even speak!
Yeah, well, if I had those crazy little chicken arms, I'd be-- Look out!
She's gonna blow!
I'm sorry.
I can't have lunch today.
You know, I'm walking over here, and with every step, I'm getting madder and madder.
I mean, he called me his brother!
I know.
I told you last night.
Break up with him.
Lying like that right in front of me!
And see, I swear, it's--it's the second most humiliating thing that's ever happened to me in a locker room.
- You should break up with him.
- And what does he expect me to do, go back in the closet?
!
Hey, it's a little late.
I just bought my first pair of man-clogs, ok?
- You should break up with him.
- I--I don't know what to do!
- Break up with him.
- Actually, you know what?
I-I'm breaking up with him.
How about that?
!
You got man-clogs?
So tell me what happened with Matt.
You won't believe it.
He asked me to try and understand.
Ugh!
I hate it when men ask you to understand.
Why don't they just be honest and tell you to shut up?
Then he went on and on about how he works in sports, and he's on the air now, so he can't be as open as he'd like to be.
What a load!
All right, what did we say to him?
I just said, "Hey, I'm an out and proud gay man.
I'm not about to go back in the closet for the sake of a relationship".
Oh, that is so good!
That is so right!
We're here.
We're queer, and he better get used to it!
As far as I'm concerned it's over, and there's nothing he could say to change my mind.
I hope he cried.
What did he say?
He said he likes me.
Oh, that pig!
What kind of idiot does he take us for?
!
It's open!
Hey, Will, sorry I'm early.
Hey, Grace.
I got a cab downstairs.
We should get going.
Did I mention that he said he likes me?
Honey, put my necklaces away.
You have your own jewels to play with.
Thank you!
And I promise As this year's Miss Pregnant Teen America To represent all pregnant teens Whether they be man, woman, black or white.
Thank you so much!
Knock it off, Miss Fire Island.
I'm reminiscing.
Look at all of these.
Stan has been so good to me, honey.
Oh, and all of the sweet memories they bring back.
Hmm.
On my knees in Belize.
Oh!
On my back in Iraq.
Oh!
Oh!
And then there was that time in Nantucket!
Good times.
Well, good jewels, anyway.
Oh, look, Kare.
Stan's will.
Do you have a will?
Honey, why do I need a will?
I'm gonna live forever.
That is the deal, isn't it, Red?
Wait a minute.
I haven't seen that version.
You gonna open it?
That is a private legal document.
That would be a betrayal of everything that's sacred in our marriage.
- Can I open it?
- That'll work.
- There.
- Give me that.
Come on, Come on.
Let's just see where everything's going.
Ooh.
Stan's mother isn't getting anything.
She's gonna hate that.
"And a third of my money goes to charity".
- Charities?
!
- "Girl's Club of Greater New York" Women's shelters Sally Struthers Public television?
!
What is this crap?
!
Looks like Stan's got a big heart to go with his enlarged prostate.
Oh, balls!
Stan pays deaf immigrants He is a misanthropic money whore.
That's why I love him.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not his handiwork.
This is the work of our limp-wristed lawyer, Will Truman!
Morning.
Any of that Chinese food left?
I only had two bites when I found a hair in the mushu.
So I called the restaurant and they said, "Well, how do we know it's not your hair"?
And I said, "Well, I know how my hair tastes".
It made me sound crazy, so I hung up.
Anyway, I was so disgusted, I threw it all out.
- You ate all of it, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.
And I over-soyed, and now I'm swollen.
You gonna ask me about last night?
Ok.
Fine.
Good.
You know, 'cause I certainly don't owe you any explanation about my relationship with Matt.
- Nope, you don't.
- Oh, would you stop hounding me?
!
Look, he thinks I'm handsome.
He thinks I'm smart.
He thinks I'm funny.
He's basically everything I'm looking for in a man.
Not to mention the fact that we wear the same size, so I'm basically doubling my wardrobe.
I just don't understand how you could be in a relationship where you can't be you.
Yeah, well, being me hasn't gotten me a whole lot of action lately.
Or maybe you haven't been following my story line on "No Sex in the City".
What do you want from me?
All I'm asking for is a little support.
Will, what you are doing is wildly hypocritical and against everything you believe in.
You deserve so much better.
But, hey if you want my support, you've got it.
- I want your support.
- You don't got it.
- Mornin, kittles!
- Jack, back me up on this.
You know Will's boyfriend?
Ever since he got this on-air job, he's gone back in the closet, and Will wants to go on dating him.
Thank you!
I know the perfect place to take him.
- What?
!
- Yeah, there's this fish restaurant in Queens.
It's where all the gay guys take their closet boyfriends.
You know, it's like a casual, sawdust-on-the-floor, hand-down-my-pants kind of place.
- Jack, he introduced Will as his brother.
- Grace, just have dinner with us.
Ok?
I mean, Matt's a good guy, and I know you'd like him if you just got to know him.
- Absolutely not.
- They make those killer deep-fried onion blossoms.
One dinner.
- What did you order?
- I just told the chef to surprise me.
Think that was a mistake in a place that's located next to a pet hospital?
Grace, hi.
You gonna-- Grace?
Hang on.
What-- What are you doing?
You gonna join us?
No.
I thought about it, and I cannot, in good conscience, have dinner with you two.
- I-I'm not gonna be a party to your lie.
- So, what, you're just here to judge me?
Will, believe it or not, I have better things to do with my life.
I'm here for the onion blossom.
So don't worry.
As soon as they call number 39, I'm out of here.
- Number 38!
- Yes!
I'm starving.
Number 40!
- I'm going back to my date.
- Good.
Don't want to keep your brother waiting.
Might give you a wedgie.
- Isn't Grace gonna join us?
- Uh, no, we had a bit A fight back at home.
- It's a long story.
- What's the short version?
We fought at home.
Ok.
Fair enough.
So, I've never been here before.
Interesting choice.
- Great, isn't it?
- Yeah.
How'd you find it?
Jack told me about it.
Said it was the perfect place for-- For a guy like you.
- Presbyterian?
- Exactly.
Hey, what are you doing on the weekend?
'Cause I was thinking, you know, we could, uh-- We could-- uh - We could what?
- We could drive to the coast.
There's this great little bed and-- Would you just Hold on for one sec.
- Would you cut it out!
- What?
You're looking at me all disapproving, rolling your eyes.
I was debating whether or not I should add clam strips to my order.
You were not!
I know that look.
It's the same look you give me when I do a British accent.
- I never..
- Oh, don't you love?
Aha, there it is!
Look, if you are feeling guilty because you're compromising everything you believe in, that's your thing.
Don't put that on me.
I'm just standing here thinking about clam strips, which is moot, because they're all out Out and proud.
- Number 39?
- Yes!
Just Stop looking at me.
I'm sorry.
That won't happen again.
Nothing is going to keep us from enjoying our evening.
Hey, Matt!
Harry, hey, what are you doing here?
Bringing some dinner home for my wife.
She loves this place.
Her hairdresser recommended it.
- Why don't you join us, Harry?
- Don't mind if I do.

- That's right.
That's me.
- So, Will, you a big jock like Matt?
- Oh, yeah.
Hell, I'm wearing a cup right now.

Why?
Couple of guys at your old job said there's rumor going around That you might be gay.
Me?
Gay?
Me, gay?

I think two guys together is hot.
W-what?
Matt, there's something I have to tell you.
I'm gay.
Mom is gonna freak.
You don't seem gay.
Well, that's probably because my party dress is at the cleaners.
But make no mistake about it, Harry.
I am a gay man.
I sleep with men.
I have no desire to sleep with women Not now, not ever.
You screwed me, Will Truman!
What?

Goodbye.
Grace, that blouse hurts like a hangover.
You know what?
Maybe this isn't the best time to talk about this.
Maybe it isn't, but I've got to say this.
I can't go on lying.
I know I said that I would, and I'm sorry, but I can't.
The only way I know how to be in a relationship with you brother is if we are open and honest.
Those are the terms.
Can you accept that?
I wish I could but I can't.
- Well, then I can't, either.
- Good for you!
Who the hell are you?
Just a single woman in a fish place, applauding a courageous man.
Come on, Grace.
Let's go home.
Oh, but my onion-- Matt, I-- I know how hard this must be for you.
A gay guy in your own family.
I can't imagine what you're feeling right now.

- Jack?
- Justin?
- Dad?
Number 39!
Coming through.
Coming through.
Grace, you've been whittling away at that onion blossom for three hours now.

Ok.
Don't!
No, no, no, no.

{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Ignore it.
We're screening.
Here's the story of a lovely lady.
That's me Who was living with a very lovely girl.
That's me!
Leave a message.
I hate us so hard right now.
New rule.
No more making phone machine messages after a pitcher of "margateenies".
Mail's here, and he is hot!
We also got some letters.
An advertisement for teeth bleaching Oh, this must be yours.
And for moi A postcard from Mama.
She's still on that cruise?
Yep.
Sailin' the Caribbean with boatload of desperate, saggy singles.
I gave her the toll-free number.
Oh, my God.
Listen to this.
I don't need my teeth bleached.
They're fine.
Excuse me.
Girl, interrupted.
"Jack, I know this may come as a shock to you but your father is a black boy.
Gotta run.
It's coconut shrimp night.
Kisses, Mommy".
She said your father's a black boy?
And they have an entire night dedicated to coconut shrimp?
What is that toll-free number?
Oh my God I'm black.
I'm black, and my mother says "black boy".
I'm black, and my mother's a racist.
Actually, Grace, I totally see it.
What?
Jack's black.
I don't know why I have never noticed this before.
I salute you, my proud, black brother.
Thank you, Will.
It's nice to have your support.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go find out what it means to be black like me.
Oh, man They're raising the rent on my storage space again?
Don't start.
I don't get it.
Throwing away good money to store a car you never even use.
It's my Uncle Jerry's car.
Uncle Jerry is dead.
For four years now, Uncle Jerry has been dead.
And that car is the only thing I have to remember him by.
- It has sentimental value.
- It's a Chevy Citation With no A/C and old man stink.
It's family.
You wouldn't understand that, because you're tiny-hearted.
Did you just call me Tonya Harding?
Don't flatter yourself.
You've got a weird thing about family.
Everyone thinks so.
Lose the car.
You never use it.
What if we did use it?
We could zip off to the Hamptons whenever we wanted to.
Wouldn't that be fun?
Here we go.
That's weird.
What do you think's wrong?
She just asked a fairy an engine question.
Oh, my God.
We're all gonna die in this car.
Karen, you're not gonna die.
It'd take a silver bullet and a wooden stake to do that.
Come on.
Let's look.
All right, but you pop the hood.
I just got a mani.
You know, honey, I'm happy for you And I'm happy for me, I've always wanted a black friend.
I finally found my roots, Kar.
It's like my whole life, I've been waiting to exhale.
I wish they would hurry up.
I've got to get home for a playdate.
That pasty, pretentious eunuch Beverley Leslie is coming over to play pool.
So, cancel.
Honey, no!
He's my dearest friend.
I thought I was your dearest friend.
He's my dearest white friend.
I think that fixed it.
What did you guys do?
I opened the hood and jiggled the bendy thing.
I scratched my head and readjusted myself.
You know, uncle Jerry used to take me to ballet class in this very car.
Then, after, we'd go to Friendly's for a fribble and a fish-a-ma-jig, and I think there's something wrong with your car.
What are you talking about?
It's purring like a kitten.
Yeah.
A kitten who smokes God, this is like a Cheech and Chong movie.
Dear I can't seem to set up this shot.
My big, new diamond ring keeps throwing off my balance.
Good for you, Bev.
That must have cost your wife a pretty penny.
You wouldn't believe the disgusting sexual perversions I had to perform to get that.
Oh, I think I would.
Meet the twins.
Yes, ma'am!
Lord, the things we do for love.
And money.
- Here you go.
- Where the hell have you been?
Riding a llama in Neverland.
Where do you think I was?
I was cleaning.
Mr. Beverley Leslie, here's your B-52 with one ice cube.
Thank you, sweetie.
I thought your drink was a blackberry julep with a baby aspirin chaser.
I switched.
Wait a minute.
How do you know that?
- Because - Come on, come on Because I'm good at my job.
Quit busting my hump, lady.
What?
Nothing, honey.
I was just lookin' at your balls.
You're stripes, right?
Here we go.
Here's all the stuff from inside the car, and here's your $350.
Did you find a good home for him?
Yeah, honey, I did.
I sold him to a family with a farm.
There's lots of room for him to roam and lots of other cars for him to play with.
Poor Uncle Jerry.
You work hard, you live a good life, and this is all it comes down to.
You will not believe the day I've had!
Something must be done.
Look, it's Notorious F.A.G. I just stood in the freezing cold for 40 minutes, trying to get a cab.
I finally had to walk halfway across town.
Why couldn't you get a cab?
Why do you think?
Because I'm black.
Maybe you should go down to Boy Bar and try and get a little affirmative action.
You guys better climb out of your ivory tower and smell the coffee because it's here, it's hot, and it's black!
That was kind worth it.
Oh, my gosh.
Where - Where did this come from?
- That was in the tape deck.
It says, "For Grace".
How could I have never found this?
- Hello, Mini.
- Oh, my God!
That's what he called me Mini.
Hi, Uncle Jerry.
Mini, you know how much you mean to me.
You're my family, and this Chevy Citation represents my deep, deep affection for you As long as you have this car, I'll always be with you.
And you sold my Uncle Jerry for $350.
How you must feel!
Actually, I sold it for $400, and kept 50 as a finder's fee.
Not a time to laugh, though.
Well, well, well El pollo's come home to roost.
How's Beverley?
- Miss Karen, I was just - Don't insult me with your lies.
I know where you were Scrubbing floors for Beverley Leslie.
I can smell his generic cleaning products all over you.
It's not what you think.
Oh, really Is that a new Members Only jacket you're wearing?
So, what if it is?
A lady likes nice things.
I see Tell me Is he good to you?
He lets me wear jeans to work.
Disgusting!
I don't wanna know all the filthy details.
- What does he feed you?
- Subway.
The 12-inch.
Oh, how could you?
I was your world.
Are you really gonna throw all that away for a casual 12-inch sub?
You steal from him, too?
Oh, my God.
It's serious.
Oh, my God.
It's serious.
This isn't a farm!
This is Queens.
I don't know what happened.
Last time I swear, there were cows here.
Look, we'll give back the $350 $400, Mr. Finder's fee.
Right, and then that'll be the end of it.
Here she comes.
You sold my Uncle Jerry to a nun?
I'm Sister Louise.
What can I do you for?
I'm Grace Adler.
I think it is so wonderful that you're married to God.
Me, I'm still looking.
Anyway We want to give you your money back.
Great!
So we can get our car back.
It's a family thing.
I'm sure you understand.
My family sent me to a convent when I was three.
Actually, they told me I was going to the zoo.
I was all excited.
They got me dressed up, gave me a lollipop, I ended up here.
All I wanted to do was see the penguins.
Ironic, isn't it?
What's sex with a man like?
- It's good, actually - I've loved it - If you find the right guy - Ever since the first time - It's nothing really - It's no big deal - You just lie there.
- You're not really missing anything.
Maybe we should get back to the car.
I've got your money here and I'm gonna throw in an extra $50 for your trouble.
No, thanks.
No, I need the car to deliver my cheesecakes.
Little business I got going on the side.
Well, can't you get another car?
I need this car.
It's my Uncle Jerry's car.
I might have an Uncle Jerry, who knows?
I was sent to a convent when I was 3.
I thought I was going to the zoo.
Have I told you the story?
Yeah, you have.
ell, then the answer to the car question No.
What do you mean, no?
I'm talking about my Uncle Jerry here.
Talk to the beads.
What?
I can't believe that you're Listen, listen.
I'm really sorry about the whole zoo thing but nobody messes with my family.
What do you need with a car anyway?
Can't you fly?
Well, let's see The Bible does teach the value of charity and helping your fellow man.
Yes.
It does.
But God's no fool.
I want $3,000 in traveler's checks.
What?
Are you kidding?
You paid $400.
Look, you two work it out, I got to go.
"What a Friend We Have in Cheesecake" doesn't run itself.
What?
No!
No, I'm not spending $3,000 on this piece of junk.
- Just let it go!
- Fine.
but I hope that you never have to feel what I'm feeling right now.
- Me, too.
- And when you do, I hope it hurts.
Let me just say goodbye.
Bye, Uncle Jerry.
I'm sorry.
I'll never forget you Bird poop.
You came between one of the most sacred relationships there is A woman and her housekeeper.
What can I say?
She just prefers being around masculine energy.
Let's leave your wife out of this.
I want you to stay away from Rosario!
What Rosario does on her own time is Rosario's business!
You do not own her, my dear.
She's a person!
I know damn well what he is.
You don't have to tell me my own maid is a person.
Of course she's a person!
- I'll play you for her.
- All right, you're on.
Damn it!
I'm really going to enjoy having Rosario around the villa.
She even alphabetized my imposter fragrances.
Special lady.
- She sure is special.
- Eightball.
Side pocket.
I would have made that shot!
Tell it to the Marines if you already haven't.
I'm up!
Eightball.
Side pocket.
Oops.
You scratched, I won.
Rosario's mine.
The hell she is!
Now back off, you Keebler elf.
Don't you you take that tone with me, mister!
I'm not afraid to hit you, you little cup-size capote.
How about that?
- Well, bring it on, big cheater!
- Maid stealer!
Get off me, Tattoo.
Get off of me!
You bitch!
You bitch!
I won fair and square.
Rosario's mine.
Stop it.
You won me in a game of pool?
- It was her idea - What am I, your prize bull?
!
It was her idea, Rosario.
I called you a person.
Shut up, lucky charms!
Don't you listen to him.
I'm not listening to anyone.
I don't want to see either one of you again.
- What ya doing?
- Cleaning house.
You know, this whole car thing made me realize I hold onto stuff way longer that I need to.
Your Nancy Drew, Girl Detective membership card?
Aren't you going to need that in case something mysterious happens down at Old Man Winsley's place?
The creepy caretaker did it.
Anyway, I don't need it.
Just like I don't need this "remember me always" bracelet I got from what's-her-name.
Or this piece of the Berlin Wall I got as a gift with purchase at the Lancôme counter at Bloomingdale's.
How about these clown shoes?
Those are my ballet slippers from fourth grade.
I went from a 4 to an 8 in a month.
Anyway, you were right, I just have to let all this stuff go.
- Want to put those in there?
- What's that?
The keys to your Uncle Jerry's car.
Oh, my God!
I can't Wait - What made you change your mind?
- I don't know.
I guess I just thought about you kissing that bird poop and It just made me feel a little sick at first then sad and then sick again when I realized that we'd shared a spoon at the yogurt shop later that day.
I don't know what to say.
I just Wait a minute.
You paid You paid $3,000 for that junky car?
Well, not exactly but, you know, with a little creative thinking I was able to come up with a solution that's going to work for everybody.
Come on.
Let's move it!
We got a trunk full of cheesecakes to deliver, and they're probably starting to sweat.
Hurry up!
You promised to get me to the zoo by 4:00.
- That's right.
- We're going to the zoo.
We're going to the Who's going to the zoo?
I'm going to the zoo.
I'm going It's a big day for me.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Hey, Kare.
Hey, poodle.
Who's your daddy?
You are.
I'm devastated.
I talked to mother last night, and it turns out I'm not black.
Honey, I won't believe it.
I mean, look at you.
I know.
It's true.
I'm not black.
I'm a Black.
She got knocked up by one of the Black boys, an Irish-Catholic family from her hometown.
At least you're one step closer to finding your real dad.
Don't try to console me.
Once you've been black you can never go back.
If it makes you feel any better - I'm devastated, too.
- It does.
I mean, oh, why?
My Rosie is gone and she's never coming back!
Oh, no!
You loved her Didn't you?
I don't know.
It's more I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles her frowns Her ups her downs.
Is cook making noodle pudding?
Miss Karen Rosie - Are you back?
- I'm back.
Where the hell are my slippers?
Have you looked up your ass, you drunken fool?

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
You know, a baboon has a more subtle mating ritual than you do.
Yeah, well, baboons can afford to be subtle.
They got those bright red behinds to work with.
- Oh, God.
- Good lord!
Honey How can you drink straight orange juice first thing in the morning?
Excuse me.
Can you stop hitting on me?
I'm sitting with my boyfriend.
Oh, I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to give you the wrong impression.
I wasn't hitting on you.
I was hitting on your boyfriend.
- You're unbelievable.
- I know.
Tell him that.
And I thought you were crude when you told the waiter that your baloney had a first name.
Good morning, ladies.
And Karen.
- You look fantastic.
- I have no extra cash.
Your teeth are yellow.
Excuse me, you wouldn't happen to have a breath mint, would you?
Actually, I do.
It's in my purse.
Well, pop it!
It's not doing you any good in there!
How offensive!
Honey, it's your breath, not mine.
Forgive her She has a heart condition She doesn't have one.
I just got off the phone with my dad.
He's coming to town on business for a few days.
So I thought we could all have dinner Friday night.
I'm busy Friday.
- How's Friday?
- It's good.
Grace, keep Sunday and Monday open.
- Okey-dokey, artie-chokey.
- And never say that again.
My dad would really like to meet you.
It would mean so much to me if you'd join us.
Honey, that is so sweet.
No.
Works every time.
Here's your Taboo card, I've got the Taboo buzzer, let's play Taboo.
And Go!
- It's a device - Alarm clock!
Ironing board!
Bull whip!
Whipped cream!
Celine Dion!
Dionne Warwick!
Damn it, will you let me give a clue, woman?
It's a device which cooks - What?
- Can't say "cooks".
Cooks is on the Taboo card.
It is therefore taboo.
Damn it!
It's impossible to guess this word without using any of these clues.
- You use mine to dry your gym socks.
- Microwave!
The problem with you, Grace, is you're using only the left side of your brain.
Can't you be more like Jack and use neither side?
Thank you.
Dad!
Come on it's our turn!
Congratulate me, will ya?
I just got off the scale.
I lost 7 pounds.
Were you using Grace's scale?
Then you've actually gained two pounds.
Well, if I'm already going down What happened to the last slice of pizza?
I thought everyone was done, so I threw it down my throat.
Isn't she something?
She's better than a garbage disposal.
And she doesn't make that awful sound when a fork gets stuck in her.
I'll make you something, Dad.
No, no, no.
It's a hassle.
Unless you got a nice semi-soft cheese?
What happened to this guy Matt you keep talking about?
He sounds like dynamite.
Why isn't he here?
- I meant to mention that, Dad.
We broke up.
- I never liked him.
- You never met him.
- I don't have to meet him.
Any guy can't make it work with you, there's something wrong with him.
My dad had never said anything that sweet to me.
The last time I was home he turned around from his "Kojak" rerun and told me I looked like a hooker in that tube top.
That's a good story I found out a year ago my miserable homophobic father is really my miserable homophobic stepfather, and I have no idea who my real dad is.
Don't play the distant daddy game with me, girly.
I'll kick your ass every time.
Now, you know, I'm up on Jack's love life because of his internet mailing list.
But what about you, Grace?
Anybody new?
Anything happening, you know?
Well, we've only gone on two dates, but I've been seeing - Frankenstein.
- Ian.
His name is Ian.
That's his last name.
His first name is Frankensty.
Put 'em together, you got Frankensty-ian.
He does not look like Frankenstein.
Right, Will?
Well, he's very large, he has a square-shaped head Every time I've seen him he's being chased by torch-wielding villagers.
God'll get you for that, Walter.
Come on, Dad, it's our turn.
Let's do that Taboo that we do so well.
- Ok, I'm ready.
- Okgo.
- I give up.
- Dad!
I'm not in the mood.
I'm really not in the mood.
You know, I had a day, then I had a situation.
I gotta go back to the hotel.
Come on, I hardly ever get to see you.
Tomorrow Make it Friday.
Friday night we'll have dinner, ok?
Right now I just I feel like gettin' back to my room, putting my feet up and ordering up that movie where Ashley Judd runs around scared in town.
Well, beats going home watching mom run around scared of water stains on the Beidermeyer.
Don't be so rough on your mother, ok?
- You're right.
I'm sorry.
- I hate getting harsh with you.
That's harsh?
Whenever I call home, my father hands the phone to my mother and says "it's the middle disappointment".
My mother had anonymous sex With one of 11 brothers now scattered across the country and nine months later I was born.
You don't learn, do you?
I've got your picture and résumé but I should tell ya, you're not exactly what we're looking for.
Any notes?
Well, since you asked I'd project more and lose your aversion to being fondled.
Deal with it!
Broadway's a very hands-on business.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's with all the man-candy in the hallway?
They're actors who answered an ad I placed in Casting Call Weekly.
- I'm auditioning.
- For what?
For fun.
Do you mean to tell me you dragged these poor, struggling actors down here and got their hopes up just for your own amusement?
I just wanted to get clear on your process.
Next!

- Dirty bird!
You flap your wings Feed me the worm Where the hell did he go?
Oh, that is so unprofessional.

I didn't like him anyway.
He was coming off a little gay when he should have been coming on a little gay.
Listen We're gonna take a little break.
We'll be back at 12:30 when we'll be casting the parts of "Naked Man with Massage Oil" and "Naked Man with Stoli".
I love the theater.
Take me to the salon.

I can't, honey.
I'm meeting Stanley.
We have a standing lunch once a month so I remember what he looks like in the daylight.
Hey, Rosie, how ya doing?
Quit blabbering.
It's only an expression.
Go what myself?
Well, if I could do that, I wouldn't need Mr. Walker, now would I?
Speaking of which, put him on.
Well, where the hell is he?
We had a lunch date.
He never cancels.
Did he leave me a number, where I could reach him?
Oh, and one other thing So what's your favorite part of the Seussical so far?
Probably the look that row of shrunken old people gave you when you sat down in front of them.
Well, that'll teach 'em to unwrap butterscotch during the overture.
You want anything from the bar?
Whatever they got.
But nothing to drink.
The line for the ladies room goes from here to Whoville.
Oh, yeah, like in the play.
Not smart.
Doesn't need to be.
What are you what are you What are you doing here?
I love Dr. Seuss.
Though my mom used to read that one story to me as "one fish, two fish, goy fish, Jew fish".
Listen, with me This is kind of a last-minute kind of thing, you know?
- The concierge at the hotel had tickets - Here you go, sweetheart.
Thanks.
to see a show, you now?
I mean, that's the great thing about New York.
You know, last year I saw - Death of - George, who is this with you?
Tina.
a Salesman, with Brian Dennehy.
You know, you wouldn't think a guy that powerful - could play Willy Loman and make it work, but - Hi, Tina, I'm Grace.
How do you two know each other?
Tina's a colleague of mine.
That's right we're colleagues.
What kind of colleagues are you?
Working.
We're working colleagues.
I catered his company's Christmas party.
It must've been some party.
It's February.
You must be a meticulous cleaner-upper.
Well, look we'd better get back to our seats.
We gotta catch the second act of - What the hell are we seeing?
- Seussical.
I love rhyming.
I cannot believe what I just saw.
Married men having affairs.
Is there anything worse?
I should go.
Oh, congratulations.
I'm on my way over.
Bye.
I've got to go.
The Fergusons are pregnant.
So I've got to convert their S&M room into a nursery.
At least I can keep the jolly jumper and the changing table.
Before I go, can I run something by you?
Honey, could you give me a minute?
I'm kind of in the middle of a project.
Cross that off the "to do" list.
Well, that's good.
Now I don't have to take my work home with me.
Although knowing me, I probably will.
You know I'm a workaholic.
What can I do for ya?
All right, how do I say this?
If you see a person doing something wrong Something that could hurt another person, do you tell the person what the person was doing or do you protect the person by not telling the person what the person was doing?
Oh, honey.
Did you get knocked up again?
What?
No!
I was out last night, and I saw someone who is very close to a friend of mine having an affair.
I mean, I didn't actually see 'em going at it.
Cause you know, that would be creepy, but I saw him on a date with a woman who was obviously his mistress.
Really.
So, do I tell my friend about it?
I mean, do you think they need to know?
Absolutely not.
Thank you.
That's all I needed to hear.
Stanley Walker, you cheating piece of old man flap!
You're a dead man!
Look.
Jack in a box.
Kar, take me to lunch.
I'm in a lobster bisque-y, crème brule-y cruisy-waitery kind of mode.
Honey, brace yourself.
Stan's having an affair.
I don't believe it!
It's impossible He's so fat!
Grace caught him red-handed.
He was by himself?
Oh, I should've known.
Lately he's been wearing his good toupée and his fancy compression garment.
Come on, let's go.
I'm gonna catch that rotund Romeo in the act!
Shouldn't you lock up?
Somebody might steal something.
Oh, my God, honey, you're right.
That's terrible.
Remind me never go get a free chiropractic exam from a guy set up in front of a deli.
All he did was adjust my boob.
I guess the gloves with no fingers should have tipped me off.
What's cookin', good lookin'?
Whenever my dad goes to a restaurant he always says the same thing.
"God, I can make a meal just from the appetizers".
So, that's what I'm making him: a meal of appetizers.
Good, good.
Mom never lets him eat this stuff at home.
Why shouldn't he?
- Why not?
- He's a great guy.
- He is.
- He should have a little fun.
- He's having an affair.
- He's what?
I wasn't gonna say anything, but Karen told me not to, so I knew I had to.
The other night, when I was at Seussical the Musical I saw your dad with another woman.
Wait minute, wait a minute.
You went to Seussical the Musical?
For once in your life can you skip over the show tunes and listen to what I'm saying?
I know all about Tina.
It's his colleague.
I don't think so.
During "Green Eggs and Ham" his hands were here, his hands were there, his hands were almost everywhere.
Let it go, ok?
She's a colleague.
She is not a colleague.
Do you grab your colleague's ass when they give you a box of Goobers at intermission?
Was it a jumbo box?
I'm gonna say this just once.
My family is not like your family.
There's certain things that we don't talk about So, if my dad says that she's a colleague, that's what she is.
So you're just gonna deny the truth to avoid suffering?
That is so not Jewish.
That's right.
Consider this one of the gentiles' three gifts to the world.
One: we make a great martini.
Two: we keep retail stores alive.
End three: we don't talk about things that we don't want to know about.
- So, you admit there's a problem.
- No, I don't.
See how that works?
See, your problem is you're too suspicious.
You know, I mean, for one thing if my dad was in town to see his girlfriend why would he be spending his last night with us?
- Hi, I can't stay.
- What?
This business thing just came up and sort of ballooned into Give me a hug.
I gotta run.
Well, no, Dad, I just made dinner.
I got won tons and crab cakes and chicken drumettes.
God, I could make a whole meal out of that.
- Tina, what are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, I gotta pee.
I couldn't wait.
It was all that champagne in the limo.
It goes right through her.

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Last time on Will and Grace I was out last night, and I saw someone who is very close to a friend of mine having an affair.
I saw him on a date with a woman who was obviously his mistress.
Stanley Walker, you cheating piece of old man flap!
What happened to this guy Matt you keep talking about?
He sounds like dynamite.
Why isn't he here?
- I meant to mention that, Dad.
We broke up.
- I never liked him.
- You never met him.
- I don't have to meet him.
Any guy can't make it work with you, there's something wrong with him.
My dad had never said anything that sweet to me.
The last time I was home he turned around from his "Kojak" rerun and told me I looked like a hooker in that tube top.
That's a good story I found out a year ago my miserable homophobic father is really my miserable homophobic stepfather, and I have no idea who my real dad is.
Don't play the distant daddy game with me, girly.
I'll kick your ass every time.
What's cookin', good lookin'?
Whenever my dad goes to a restaurant he always says the same thing.
"God, I can make a meal just from the appetizers".
So, that's what I'm making him: a meal of appetizers.
Good, good.
Mom never lets him eat this stuff at home.

- Why not?
- He's a great guy.
- He is.
- He should have a little fun.
- He's having an affair.
- He's what?
I'm gonna say this just once.
My family is not like your family.
There's certain things that we don't talk about So, if my dad says that she's a colleague, that's what she is.
- I can't stay.

I gotta run.
Well, no, Dad, I just made dinner.
I got won tons and crab cakes and chicken drumettes.
God, I could make a whole meal out of that.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry, I gotta pee.
I couldn't wait.
It was all that champagne in the limo.
Bathroom?
It's the room on the right.
The one with the toilet in it.
That makes sense.
Oh, I'm sorry, my turn.
I'm gonna call the restaurant and tell 'em we'll be a little late.
I'll be right back.
Oh, Will, what you must be feeling.
We're just talking about it, and then there it is!
"There it is"?
What am I supposed to say?
"Who let the dogs out"?
She's a colleague.
Ohcomeon.
I mean, it's one thing when it's just this abstract notion floating out in the universe, but it's another thing when it's peeing in your toilet.
Let it go this is not a problem.
Do you really expect me to believe that you're ok with this?
I do.
In fact, I'll show you how ok I am.
I'm gonna invite them both to dinner.
Oh, right.
Yeah, the four of us are gonna eat together.
That's a dysfunctional dinner I'd like to see.
Crab cakes are dynamite.
And what do you think of the chicken drumettes, Pop?
You know, I used a little marmalade the glaze.
I call the recipe "Chicken Lady Marmalade".
You know, one of these days, I'm gonna have to figure out the difference between marmalade and jam.
Maybe I could find it online.
You know, there's something we haven't talked about I'm really kind of surprised nobody's ever brought it up.
Oh, finally.
Is this not the coldest winter we have ever had?
Any sign of the chubby cheater?
No.
He's been in that podiatrist office for, like, two hours.
Getting his hammer toes fixed up nice and shiny for his new slut!
That garbage man is hot.
Grind that garbage, trash man.
Yeah, you're so dirty Over there, honey.
Over there.
Stan's in his car.
He's probably heading off to his love nest.
Drive, drive!
- Your skin looks good, Jack.
- I've been washing my makeup off before I go to bed.
Where is he going?
He's going at that hore house.
That's not a hore house.
That's Burger King.
What?
Stop the car!
What happened?
What's going on?
What is he doing?
He's going straight to the window.
What?
Did he call the order in?
No, they know his car.
When they see him coming, they grab five whoppers, a couple of pies throw them to the window and try not to get the fingers near his mouth.
Not this time It looks like they're handing him a. a salad.
That's all the proof I need.
First he gets his toes in shape Now he's eating sensitive .
My god, has the men no shame?
I know what you're going through.
I once found out Marco planned on cheating on me with someone he met threw a personal ad.
- How did ou catch him?
- It was my ad.
I could have screamed and yelled but instead I took the high road and had an affair with my very own but my point is Don't get mad.
Get a new rich husband Exactly Drive!
I just can't get used to the cold.
- I mean, I'm an Arizona girl.
- Tempe?
About 110 in the summer.
Me, I don't mind the cold.
I never have.
Too cold is Is not good.
I like it just, you know cold enough.
You know, you get a sweater, you get a hot drink.
You know what I'm talking about?
No, I don't mind the cold.
- But I also like it hot.
- Some like it hot.
Get it?
So, Grace What do you like?
What Are we really still talking about the weather?
Tina, come on.
I want to show you their view.
They've got a hell of a balcony.
Not so much a balcony as a dead plant museum.
We'll bring a t-shirt from the gift shop.
My - God!
- What?
What the hell was that?
I know.
Next time I'm gonna label the whipped peas.
Everybody always thinks it's guacamole, and then it's just a letdown.
That dinner was unbelievable!
The level of denial You people should be studied!
- Give me a break.
- No!
I am serious!
I feel like a Jewish Jane Goodall, and you're "goyim in the mist"!
Aren't you upset by this?
He's not even my dad, and I'm upset by this.
Why don't you call him on this?
Why?
I'll tell you why!
Because I'm not gonna be the one to drop a bomb like this on my family!
I did it once before one Christmas, and it ripped us apart!
When you told your mother you hated her fruitcake?
No!
When I told my mother I was a fruitcake!
Will, that is totally different.
What you were doing wasn't wrong.
Look, it just doesn't matter!
Let someone else confront him on this.
In the meantime, we're not gonna talk about this, and that includes you.
But I You I It's a little chile con carne out there, you guys.
- It's cold, actually.
- Not too cold to snow.
You know, the other day it was too cold to snow, the proof?
It didn't snow.
Remember that, Grace?
Yeah.
I remember.
We thought it was gonna snow But it didn't.
But it'sit's never too hot to rain.
I remember this one summer day The weather was perfect.
Or at least we thought it was perfect.
But then this hot front came in from the west.
This hot skinny front And it made it rain.
And we couldn't ride our bicycles And nothing was ever good ever again!
That really is bad weather!
I'm so confused!
I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.
And all the other people are pigs And I'm the pretty one, but everyone thinks I'm ugly because they're all pigs and they think pigs are pretty!
I like the one with Burgess Meredith when he broke his glasses.
He was The Penguin, too.
And you know where penguins live, it's really cold.
I cannot do this anymore!
I am sorry!
There is a problem in this room that nobody's talking about!
I'll say it.
You've got a boob coming out.
I have got to get out of this room Right now.
- Sorry, I'd better - No, no.
Let me.
Sometimes a woman needs to speak to another woman.
And besides, I need a cigarette.
Well.
I don't know what to say.
I'm disappointed in you, Will.
You're disappointed in me?
Tina shows up here, and I think, "My God, this is my worst nightmare.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me".
Why don't I just handle my mid-life crisis with hair plugs and a Ferrari like any other normal person?
- You bought the Ferrari.
- How do you think I met Tina?
Instead, you invite us to sit down here and have dinner, and I think, "Wait a second.
Wait a second.
Maybe this is good.
Maybe somebody will finally drag this out in the open".
Instead, what do we do?
We sit down, we talk about the difference between a tsunami and a monsoon like a bunch of Micronesian hut people!
Say what's on your mind!
Come on Dad!
We're Trumans.
We don't do that, remember?
We don't, but you do.
You're the brave one.
Look at your life!
You came out.
You told the truth.
I rely on you to say what's what!
I know you're having an affair.
And I think it sucks!
Good.
Good.
This is good.
But you're my dad, you know?
You're my hero!
And you keep doing this stuff and expecting me to look the other way and I can't keep doing it!
I need this, you see?
I need this.
Come on!
And it hurts me.
And it makes me angry, and I can't pretend it doesn't.
You shouldn't!
You shouldn't!
Don't!
I need to say this.
- You do!
You do!
- And you need to hear this!
- I do.
- And so does mom.
Let's take it easy.
I'll I'll talk to mom.
Good.
Well, we're I will be in a 100% honest.
There is one more thing I've got to tell you.
It was the worst guacamole I've ever eaten.
What are you looking at, Driver?
Keep you eyes on you own coktail.
Here it is Your new husband catalog.
- A.k.a - "Hot Jocks".
Oh my dog, it's so embarrassing.
It's totally my husband catalog.
The 400 richest people in America Let's find you something a husband.
Oh my god Yes.
Bernard Hellman.
Oh yeah.
Bernie is our men.
Karen Delaney Saint Croix Poppy Walker Hellman.
It's gonna ring good.
God Driver!
Get us to the Santon Place and step on it.
Step on it.
Yes mister In just a few short minutes, I'll be on my way to to be What the hell am I doing?
Hello Mrs McFarland Jack, I can't do this.
Stan is everything to me I've go to take the moral high ball - Don't you mean the high ground?
- It'll come right after the high ball.
Just because Stan is having an affair it doesn't mean that I should get rid of him.
But I'm not gonna take this lying down.
So let's go find the woman who is.
Jesus Christ.
I don't know why I fell for him, Grace.
Because all the good ones are married or gay.
And you got the gay one.
Would you mind putting that down.
It's really bothering me.
I'm sorry It's such a disgusting habits.
That's why I paid 2 ground to a hypnotist in Boston to help me quit.
Money well spent.
I don't know why I took this all so personally.
I guess it's because I've always thought George is the perfect dad My dad has always been so emotionally unavailable.
He once missed my field hockey finals because Rosey Grier was signing autographs at the local Ford dealership.
My dad went to prison when I was four.
The only contact we've ever had is through a sheet of bulletproof glass.
I never win this game.
There you are.
You played it pretty cool the other day but I wanna know who he's having the affair with, and I wanna know right now!
Well, that would be her.
I'm Tina.
Don't give me the How dare you come between a man and his wife!
What you're doing is morally wrong!
I have kids with that man!
His ex-wife's body is ruined as a result!
But he's all I've got.
You think that you're coming between me and Stanley Walker, you're not gonna get him without a fight.
That's right, lady, put 'em up!
Who's Stanley Walker?
She's having an affair with Will's dad.
Good for you, honey!
He's a good catch, keep up the good work, you got a nice ass!
Hey Mister Men Never looked better.
Well Maybe once but I doubt it.
Karen, you're back.
I've been worried sick.
Did you find anything else?
The best news ever!
I heard shewing.
I'm so relieved.
It was all a mistake.
Grace told Will's dad was having an affair.
Wait Stan was having an affair with Will's dad?
It's two men but I'm strangely astonished No fruit of the loon They saw Will's dad with another women Stan's clean, isn't it great?
Wait a minute If Will's dad was having the affair then why was Stan getting his toes polished in eating salad?
Oh my god, you're right.
That adultery bastard.
He has been making some other woman uncomfortable for three minutes.
Three minutes?
That vitamine has been working.
I'll kill him!
Lady, your dumber than the lint I cleaned out of your trap.
What are you doing, talking?
I thought I had your job wired shut.
I'm gonna put biz in your pillow tonight.
You know, all these stuff Mr Stan is doing for you getting more cleaned up and skinny He was worried that he disgusted you in bed.
How did he get an idea like that?
Maybe from that certified letter you send him?
Don't aske me why but the man loves you.
In fact, he's upstairs right now waiting for you.
My Stanley loves me There is no one else, I'm the only one.
That's right.
I'm so lucky.
My little sugar cube is up there waiting for me right now.
Ready to spend me like the pilar on the Black Cook.
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.
Lady!
All right.
You can come too.
You know, you were incredibly inappropriate tonight.
I asked you to stay away from my family's buisiness and you stuck your nose in it anyway.
You acted like a total loon in the process.
I know.
- Thanks, I owe you a big time.
- I know.
Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
I'm kinda in a playful mood.
Let's go to the batting cages tonight.
As much as I'd love to play a rousing game of "guess who's wearing a cup," I can't.
I'm busy.
I gotta break it off with Paul.
You two are still dating each other?
God, you both have such bad taste.
He's so needy and desperate He's always telling me how gorgeous I am.
Just brought up a little Eggo there.
Last night, at the restaurant, he tried to say "I love you" in sign language.
The candle caught his sleeve on fire.
I had to throw my margarita on him.
- To put out the fire.
- No, 'cause he said "I love you" in sign language.
So why are you still going out with him anyway?
He a chubby chaser?
I'm almost embarrassed to say.
It's so ridiculous.
He has this amazing dog.
His dog I got ya I stayed with many a guy because he had a nice, big dog.
- It's so well trained.
- I'm sure it is.
- Totally kissable.
- Aren't they all?
- You do realize I'm talking about an actual dog, don't you?
- I do now.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Really, I'm not going to ask you again.
Stay out of my underwear drawer.
Nothing fits me anymore.
How did Paul handle the big shove-off?
I couldn't do it.
The dog gave me that look and then he started wagging his little tail.
You are such a sucker for a little tail.
I just wish there was some way I could keep the dog and lose the guy.
Don't say that.
It's bad karma.
I mean, I know you love to play with his dog and pet it - and talk baby-talk to it - Wait, wait.
Let me stop you before you embarrass yourself, ok?
He's talking about an actual dog, stupid.
Very good.
I'll make sure that she gets the message.
Is it me, or are you hot in here?
Oh, God, I hate myself No, that's all right.
I thought it was very sweet.
Thanks.
No, really, who the hell are you?
Sorry about that!
There were no towels in the ladies room, so I had to wait till someone came in with a long coat.
So I see you two have met.
Actually, yes So, listen, Summy Stan and I Will pick you up around 7:00 and we'll head on over to Le Chardonnay They have a lamb shank that Stan likes.
Although we could probably pour some cream sauce over a boot, and he'd be happy.
All right.
See you then.
Grace, it was really nice meeting you.
It was nice You, too.
That man is so good-looking, he put a hitch in my giddy-up.
- How do you know him?
- Oh, he's my nephew.
Your nephew?
You're an aunt?
You know, I do have a family.
I know.
I just always imagined they lived in pods somewhere in your boiler room And they only came out at night to race from village to village stealing people's essences.
Oh, honey I don't have a boiler room.
Wherever that nephew came from, I want him to come back.
We really had some heat.
We clicked.
We sparked.
You know what the best part is?
The best part is that I know that this one is not gay.
Please tell me that I'm right.
- Yes, you are.
- He's not gay.
You see?
You see all those years of dating losers and closeted gay guys and that drag queen and that one masculine-looking girl is not for nothing.
I have honed my instincts.
And my instincts are telling me that - your nephew is one quality prospect.
- He's married.
Really?
He seems gay.
Hi, Paul.
- You look gorgeous.
- Paul you don't have to keep saying, "you look gorgeous, you look gorgeous".
All right.
Hello, sexy.
Gorgeous is fine.
We need to talk and Hewwo, face!
How is my little Pepper?
Oh, I missed you so much.
Yes, I did.
Anyway, the reason I came over here was to Did somebody have a bath?
Because somebody smells dericious!
Yes, it's you.
It's you.
I took a bath, too.
But I'm already sweating.
I'm nervous because I have this hot supermodel in my apartment.
Oh, yeah, right.
Back to this.
Paul, the reason I came What are you doing?
Are you trying to use me?
- Is that what you want me to do?
- You're so good with him.
You guys really have a connection.
- Yeah, Paul, what I'm trying to say - Wait.
I just had a great idea.
You know how I'm going to that medical supply convention this weekend?
Great!
I mean, ohh.
I mean Go on.
I was going to board Pepper, but now I'm thinking why don't you just take him for the weekend?
Really?
That would be great.
So, what is it you want to tell me?
Nothing So you want to come home with me?
Anyone who wants to come home with me, give me a big kiss.
If you're looking for your Aunt Karen, she's not here.
She doesn't work on days that end with "day".
Actually, no, I came to see you.
I thought you might like to have lunch.
I'm just-- I'm just going to stop you right there, 'cause I don't I don't date married men.
Well At least not once I now they're married.
Wait a second.
What are you talking about?
I'm not married.
Yeah.
Right.
You probably keep your wedding band in your pocket.
Well, no, I don't.
You want to check?
Kinda.
Karen totally lied to me.
Why would she tell me that you were married What's goin' on here?
Sumner I thought we agreed to meet at the hotel.
Aunt Karen, why did you tell Grace I was married?
You know, there's one little thing you need to know about Grace.
She has only a passing acquaintance with the truth but she's just like this with the polyblends.
I'm not the liar here.
You're the liar.
She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up four days later with my clothes on backwards and a sticker of Baltimore on my forehead.
Honey, go on down to the limo.
Uncle Stan wants to take you out and buy you a souvenir of Manhattan.
How do you feel about 12-story buildings?
- But Aunt Karen - Oh, go on, you little pisher!
Excuse me, Karen, we're not done with this.
Why did you tell me that Sumner was married?
He's a con artist, Grace.
He meets attractive, single women, charms his way into their lives makes them think they have a future with him, and then, six months later he's gone, and so is their savings.
He even went to jail for it once.
Oh, my God!
That's awful.
Are we talking a full six months?
No.
No, no Mom, can I call you back tomorrow?
Well, I'm cooking dinner for somebody.
Well, actually, it's not really for him.
I'm doing it for his dog.
No, mother, an actual dog!
Will, where are you?
You would not believe what Karen Wow, what smells so good?
- This is great!
- You just ate that?
Yeah!
How come you never make this for me?
Because it's dog food.
Needs a little salt.
So what were you yelling about?
First, Karen tells me that I can't go out with her nephew because he's married.
Lie Then she tells me he's an ex-con.
Then he calls me, and I end up asking him whether or not the guys in the joint are as hot as they are "Oz".
Are they?
I don't know.
He's not an ex-con.
That was another lie.
So I asked him why is Karen doing this?
And he says, "It's because she doesn't want me going out with you".
She doesn't think I'm good enough for him.
- He told you that?
- Why else would she stop me from dating him?
I mean, can you believe her?
How dare she think that I'm not good enough or classy enough for her family.
You know, I gotta be honest.
That is damn good dog food.
Now, I'm gonna track her down and I'm gonna rip her a new Hold on a second.
You are sautéing dog food in my best skillet.
Yeah, well, mine doesn't heat as evenly.
I want you to say that again And listen to yourself very carefully.
Mine doesn't heat as evenly.
- For the purpose of - Making a farewell dinner.
- For - A dog.
Ok, I get it.
Paul's coming home tonight, and this whole thing is going to be over.
- By the way, where is the dog?
- Jack took him out for a walk.
Why?
So you could surprise him with this romantic dinner?
And a movie.
I'm gonna track down Karen.
I'm gonna use those little bottles of airline booze as chum.
We're back!
We had a delightful time.
Anyway, gotta run.
Tater tot.
Wait!
Whoa - Who's this?
- That's Pepper.
Your lover's dog.
His tag said dry clean only, but I washed him in warm.
- It wasn't my fault!
- Oh, no, you lost the dog?
What can I say?
We were playing fetch, and when I brought back the stick, he was gone.
Pepper is out there alone?
This Paul is gonna freak!
Relax.
He'll get over it.
Would you get over it if somebody lost your needlepoint pillow with the "Party of Five" cast?
Dear God, what have I done?
The important thing is not to panic.
We still have plenty of time to figure something out before Paul gets here.
- Maybe it's not Paul.
- Will, it's Paul!
- Maybe it's another Paul.
- Paul Budnik.
- Maybe he forgot about the dog.
- I'm here to pick up the dog.
- Maybe he's over you.
- I missed you.
Well, my work here's done.
Hold on there, girly girl!
You lost that dog, and you are gonna tell him you lost that dog.
Shift it back.
If you tell him you lost the dog he's gonna be so angry with you, he'll dump you.
You're guilt-free.
No muss, no fuss.
You are a despicable person.
Forget it!
You lost the dog.
You're gonna tell him so.
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Paul, I lost your dog.
What?
- Pepper's gone?
- Gone, gone, gone!
And it's all my fault.
So just Whatever you wanna say to me, whatever you wanna do, let 'er rip, because I deserve it.
I want you to hold me till the pain goes away.
No, I know you've got a lot of dogs.
But this one's special.
He answers to the name of Pepper And if you put your nose to his belly, it smells like corn chips.
Hello?
- Any luck?
- No.
I looked everywhere.
I really tried to put myself in a dog's position.
Why should today be any different?
This is what I get.
I only stayed with Paul because he had that great dog and now the dog is gone I'm stuck with Paul the rest of my life.
Grace was right.
She said this would come back to bite me in the ass, and it did I don't understand why you just don't break up with him.
He'll understand.
He's not hot.
No.
No.
I made my bed.
Now I'm gonna lie in it.
Ssince your next date is the fourth date, you'll be lying in it with Paul.
On the other hand Do I really owe him anything?
I mean, terrible things happen every day Dogs run away, people get sick.
Isn't it worse to continue dating Paul?
Doesn't that just compound the offense?
You know, I'm thinking about veneers.
I'm breaking it off.
For his own good.
And for my own good.
And the good of all Americans.
I love being a lawyer.
I can convince myself of anything.
Paul?
Hi, it's Will.
Listen, I Good.
We're on the same page.
Thank you.
We're going away for the weekend.
Honey, be a love and move that filthy goat pelt off my husband's seat.
Thank you.
It's nice to see you two.
The lazy eye is getting better.
Mrs. Walker, you're awful.
Oh, Lois, you have no idea.
- Ma'am, I'm gonna need to see your ticket.
- I don't have a ticket.
- Well, then, you can't go in.
- Look, it's no problem.
Just two minutes.
Miss, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to leave.
Excuse me.
Would you just take your hands off me?
It's an opera.
How about a little decorum?
We need to talk.
- How'd you know I was here?
- Rosario.
I waved a Hostess berry pie in front of her face, and she sang like bird.
That's it!
Tomorrow she loses a finger.
Look, I talked to Sumner.
He's not a scam artist, and he's never been in jail.
So can you please tell me why you are doing everything possible to What is Stan doing on the floor?
He had a turkey in the limo.
He's sleeping it off.
Oh, come on, it's Madame Butterfly.
You know how it ends.
Look, I put up with a lot of crap from you Telling me my chest is on backwards That my hair is such a disaster the Red Cross won't give it coffee.
What?
I never said that.
But I might use it.
Red Cross!
I like it!
This is different.
This hurts.
You tell me the truth.
You tell me why I can't see Sumner.
All right, you wanna know why?
I will tell you!
He's a hired assassin.
He'd just as soon kill ya as look at ya.
- No, he is not.
- Ok, he's a woman.
- A robot?
- Stop it!
Stop lying and admit it: You don't think I'm good enough for him.
What?
!
Your thong's on too tight!
Then why won't you let him see me?
- I have my reasons!
- Well, then, tell me!
- Just drop it!
- Why, because you think I only sleep with homos?
If you answer her, maybe she'll leave.
- Tell me.
- All right.
The reason I don't want you to go out with Sumner is because Because he's not good enough for you.
What?
Honey, you're special, and Sumner He's just not.
Now, don't get me wrong.
He's my nephew, and I love him like a son of a bitch.
And I mean that literally.
Stan's sister's a bitch.
But, you know, there is just no way that he is going to appreciate what a wonderful woman you are.
I mean You're quirky, you're kind.
You've got a heart as big as your feet.
So come on, let's just drop it and watch the movie.
What?
Nothing.
You just - You think I'm special.
- I do not.
- You said it.
- I take it back.
You can't take it back.
You already said it, and it's out there, and it's never gonna go away.
Well, don't let it go to your head.
Your hair's already such a disaster that the Red Cross wouldn't give it coffee!
Thanks for going away with me.
I just don't think I can stay in the city over the weekend with all these memories of Pepper.
I want us to make our own memories, Will.
Fantastic.
I found this under my couch.
Pepper's "Gaily Growl".
He loved this.
"All the news that's fit to woof".
What was that?
Mold spores.
It'll get better in the country.
Let's go.
Ok, let's go!
Pepper, you're back!
You must've climbed up the fire escape and pried open the bedroom window.
Oh, my God!
How did you get him back?
Doggie LoJack.
There's a chip in his neck.
He's trained to run away.
I can't believe it.
Do you have any idea the hell I went through trying to find this dog?
And now you're telling me you were totally scamming me?
Hey, I'm a realist.
Pepper gets me a lot of play.
He's a hot dog.
Enjoy your hot dog 'Cause you'll be gettin' none of mine.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Last cards.
Down and dirty.
- Pair of queens starts.
- That would be us!
That was funny the first 15 times you did it, but now you're just slowing down the game.
Sounds like we've got a bitter straight at the table.
So tell me, Rob How was the traffic coming over here?
Not too bad.
You just gave away your hand, my friend.
- I'm all in.
Oh, you are in trouble.
- I call.
- Me, too.
- Wait a minute.
Wait.
You don't get it.
See, I'm all in, which would indicate that I have an unbeatable hand.
- I still call.
- No, see That's just stupid.
So I'm gonna give you the opportunity to take your bets back.
You don't know this, but you have a "tell" when you're bluffing.
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.
You tell everybody you're not bluffing.
- Show 'em.
- Heh?
Oh-ho yes!
I gots the money.
Oh, I gots the mo-nay.
Damn it, now I have to go back to the ATM machine again.
All right, I want you guys to wait.
I don't want any pokey goin' on around here!
- Be careful!
- Hurry back!
- I can't play with her anymore.
- I want her out!
- She makes me violent!
- What?
Why?
She sucks.
That's as polite as I can put it.
She's obnoxious, she's aggressive, you know, she goes like this when she's thinking Call me old-fashioned, but I think poker is like cooking or gardening.
Women should just stay out of it!
I admit she's got some annoying habits, but this is Grace!
You can't just ask her to leave the game.
- No, but you can.
- She's your wife.
Oh, honey, lemme save you the trouble.
Karen, love.
It's your voice I heard.
I thought someone was strangling an old macaw.
Candy!
I can't believe you're up and around.
I guess even a mad scientist has to hit a wall at some point.
So, how they hangin', honey?
Well, thanks to Dr. kipper, three inches higher.
Listen.
As much as I'd love to stay here sweatin' with the oldies I'm getting a little woozy from the booze-y seeping from your enlarged pores.
Oh, honey, they're not enlarged.
They're just in shock over that hair color.
Sweet gal.
Hi, Kare.
Sorry I'm late.
I was getting rolled in the mud by a large Greek man.
I didn't know the spa offered that.
It doesn't.
- Why do I smell plastic burning?
- Oh, it's Candy Pruitt.
That girl does love her cosmetic surgery.
She's gone to Mexico for face-lifts so many times I'll bet if you whacked her head with a stick, prizes would fall out.
I mean, honestly Why can't people just be happy the way they are?
- Oh, I agree.
- I'm thinking of getting some work done myself.
Fantastic!
what?
My shoulders.
Oh, honey They're so 1990 and which is really just the forties with coke.
I would get some surgery, but I'm practically unapproachable as it is.
Honey, look.
Come on.
It's the latest thing Permanent shoulder implants.
This guy, Dr. Donald Dixon has perfected a brand new technique.
He uses bunny cartilage.
Not really.
That's just what I told the kids.
Oh, I don't know, Kare, I'd be careful.
I once knew this guy who went in for a nose job And couldn't stop, couldn't stop, couldn't stop Came back a woman.
You're right.
I should see it on someone else first.
I need a guinea pig.
Oh, Karen.
F.Y.I. Sasha in electrolysis just got a power mower So she ought to be able to tackle those legs of yours.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I feel good.
Been in a bit of a slump lately, but not anymore.
I've got my lucky hat on Finally horked up that thing that's been caught in my throat all day.
Why some guy hasn't snapped you up is beyond me.
Listen, Grace You ever wonder what it would be like if everybody wanted you out of the poker game?
Well This is what it's like.
You're out.
What?
No one can stand playing with you.
You're bad You get taco sauce all over the cards And at this point you're down so much, you're paying people in turquoise jewelry.
And except for Larry, none of us want it.
Where is this coming from?
You're telling me this five minutes before they get here?
I tried to tell you all week, but I What?
I'm afraid of you.
Physically.
You have oddly powerful upper body strength.
- This is so unfair!
- Ow!
See!
See!
That's what I'm talking about!
You think these little girl hits are cute, but they hurt.
Before I met you I could get my arm a lot higher than this.
Come on, just give me one more chance.
I really want to win my money back.
You won't win it back, Grace, because you're bad.
Tonight I'm gonna be better.
I know it.
I've been playing with myself and I feel much more confident.
Funny, it just makes me feel sleepy.
- Come on.
please?
- It's not gonna work this time.
I promised the guys ok!
if you'll excuse me, I am going to go put on my lucky poker bra.
Or at least a bra.
Joe gave me this shirt.
I hate it.
I have been looking forward to this game all week.
Finally we get to play a poker game without that annoying - Ready to play, guys?
- Onion dip.
Well, well.
Candy Pruitt, as I live and drink.
You know, honey, you've still got your looks.
Where are you keeping them?
Oh, Karen, love, I just had the most marvelous salt scrub.
Good for you.
There's a question that I've been meaning to ask you that only you can answer.
Is 60 sexy?
Of course.
Don't you remember?
Don't you mind me.
I'm just waiting for my very, very favorite shoulder masseur.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Before you enjoy your facial I will be giving you a little massage.
How about if I begin with you, stranger?
Perfecto.
Oh, my.
My, my, my.
What is it, doctor?
Well, your shoulders!
They're so big and broad.
Is that good?
Well, of course it is.
Don't you know it's the year of the shoulder?
Big shoulders are in and small shoulders are out, out, out!
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.
Well, nothing for me left to do here, ma'am.
It was an honor to touch your giant shoulders.
Let me just get rid of these.
Are you ready, Miss Pruitt?
Yes, please.
But I warn you If you begin touching me inappropriately, I may have to increase your tip.
Ok, let's begin.
Well.
That's just - What the hell's going on back there?
- Well, I'm sorry.
It's just that Seems as if there's no shoulder.
You go straight from neck to arm.
Why, that's absurd.
I have perfectly fine shoulders.
Yeah, if you need to rescue children from wells.
They might be a tad petite, but it's not as if I have a handicap.
No, of course not.
Tell me, is it true your other senses are heightened?
Oh, my god!
What am I going to do?
Well, you could have the surgery.
- It's experimental - Don't you do it, Candy!
Don't you listen to that shoulder expert!
God made you in his image, and I'm sure he doesn't regret it that much.
I see what you're getting at.
You want to keep me a laughingstock And of all times In the year of the shoulder.
Damn it, Grace!
Again?
Don't feel bad.
It's a game!
You just as easily could have won that hand.
I think I need a little air.
I seem to have a headache from the apple-cinnamon candleor something!
I'm feeling resentful, and it's coursing through me like poison!
It's gonna be a fun ride home for me.
All right.
I gotta go call the sitter.
You're doing very well.
I know!
Isn't it great?
I can't believe how good you've gotten Smart bets, calling everybody's bluff.
- I just can't imagine how you're doing it.
- I'm cheating!
- You're cheating?
- Yeah!
Isn't this great?
Cheating is wrong!
That's why they call it cheating.
What, are you from Florida?
I'm telling them.
No, no, don't, don't, please!
You don't understand.
You know the jewelry I lost last week?
I really have to get it back.
You don't even like turquoise jewelry!
No, I don't.
But I like what it symbolizes What?
Getting all dolled up for a Jimmy Buffett concert?
All right, forget it.
Forget it.
- Forget what?
- No, you're joking.
Just forget it.
Tell me.
That jewelry was the last thing given to my grandmother by her best friend Ruth.
They came over on the boat together from Russia.
Whenever one would get up, the other one would save her seat.
They were best friends.
My grandmother flew to Chicago to see her, but she was in and out of consciousness.
She hadn't spoken for days.
When my grandmother was alone with Ruth She leaned in and she whispered "I love you, Ruth.
Do you love me"?
And Ruth opened her eyes and said "More than I ever imagined I could.
Good-bye, my dear friend.
I'll save you a seat".
We gotta get that jewelry back.
Isn't it exciting?
Soon they'll be wheeling out a beautiful bouncing new pair of shoulders full of life and promise.
It's like childbirth, except without the unpleasant child afterward.
I don't want no scrubs, a scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me hangin' out the passenger Oh, hey, come on, let me try!
Gimme that!
Gimme that!
I love it!
I love it!
Hi, my name is Karen Walker.
How do I sound?
How do I sound?
!
Oh, my god, that voice is ridiculous!
Hospitals are fun.
Does it seem like this is taking an awfully long time?
It has been a while.
Once I saw on Dateline that this guy went in for a fungus under his fingernail and he came back with no limbs.
Luckily, he was ugly, so it wasn't that sad.
Oh, my God, Jack I just got a flash!
Something bad has happened to Candace!
- How do you know?
- Honey, you know I'm a little psychic.
Remember when I predicted that Driver was gonna lose his job, and then two days later I fired him?
My God, you're right.
And that time you predicted that Rosario was gonna fall and then you pushed her down the stairs.
You're scaring me, Karen.
It's like you have ESPN.
What if something bad has happened to Candace?
What if she's dead and it's all my fault?
Sounds like somebody needs a back rub on her front.
Deal's to me.
Everyone ante.
I'm outta cash.
Does anyone know how much this turquoise earring was worth?
More than you know, Larry.
More than you know.
Will, we really don't need to get into that right now.
It's such an incredible story.
If you guys knew where that jewelry came from Well, I do know.
I was with Grace when she bought it off the transvestite dressed as June Carter Cash.
What?
He was selling it to raise money for his "grand ole opy-ration".
Little different from the way I heard it.
Grace, can I see you outside?
Nope.
I'm still playing.
Everyone, the game's anaconda.
You're gonna take three cards and you're gonna pass them to Will, come on, we're still playing!
Well, I'm sure they'll save you a seat!
I know you're upset.
I should have told you that my grandmother was a transvestite.
- You are unbelievable!
- What's so unbelievable?
I was cheating.
Is it such a big leap to lying?
Invoking the memory of your dead grandmother?
You want to avoid the holdup in purgatory and take the express train to hell?
You're upset.
I understand.
I've been taking your money, too.
So I'll tell you what.
We get back in there Throw ya a bone.
I'm telling them.
You do, and I'll tell them you're in on it!
- You wouldn't!
- Wouldn't I?
What haven't I done tonight?
Nurse, we were looking for Miss Pruitt.
Oh, I'm sorry.
She's gone.
But don't worry.
She's in a much better place now.
Oh, my God!
she's dead!
And for what?
Just so I could fill out the new Versace strapless.
You know what would go great with that is the Jimmy Choo slingback.
Already got 'em.
Oh, God, I hate myself!
Can the salesgirls at Barney's be right?
Am I a bad person?
I could answer that.
Yes, you are.
- You're ok!
But I thought - You thought wrong.
They had me in this room, but my new shoulders were too broad for the bed.
- They are magnificent!
- Aren't they?
And they're the very last pair.
- Whaddaya talkin'?
- That's right, sugar.
You're gonna have to settle for last year's shoulders.
So the joke, it seems is on you.
Sorry, guys, I just wanted to get rid of the nacho cheese breath.
Cool ranch I bet 50.
See your 50 - Raise ya 50.
- 100, huh?
I'm out.
What's it gonna be, Rob?
- Biggest pot of the night.
You in?
- Thinking.
- I'm out.
- Yesss!
How does the song go, Rob?
I got the mo-nay, I got the mo-nay.
- So what'd you have?
- I'm not gonna tell you.
- Come on, man.
What'd you have?
- Forget it.
A pair of 3s?
What is this?
It's called good card playing.
You looked at my hand.
I wouldn't look at your hand, Rob.
I know where it's been.
Yeah, you did.
You been losing all night.
Suddenly it's the biggest pot, and you win?
You cheated.
Excuse me.
I don't cheat!
Come on, guys.
It's just a friendly poker game.
What kinda person's gonna cheat?
I don't know, Grace.
I've never seen him bluff before.
All right.
Come on, Will.
Let's just have a do-over.
A do What is this, Montessori school?
- I won this hand!
- Yeah, by cheating.
I'm taking my chips back.
- Those are mine!
Let go!
- You're not.
They're mine!
- Gimme my chips!
- You want the chips, Rob?
Take 'em!
What the hell's wrong with you?
!
Stop it!
Stop it!
It was me!
It's me!
I'm the cheater!
I could see all your cards, and Will told me to stop but I couldn't, 'cause I have a real problem losing.
I'll cheat and I'll lie.
I don't know Maybe it's from spending three years wearing a scoliosis brace.
That was a lie, too.
I am so sorry.
And I will never play poker with you guys ever again.
Say whatever you want about me.
I know I'm horrible.
That was great!
You were so convincing!
Unbelievable!
- The table was beautiful.
- I don't know I just went with it!
We're gonna get going.
We'll see you next week.
What You What?
Grace, you should know better.
In this house, a queen beats a straight every time.

Jack, eat something.
Come on.
I bought you this yummy lavender cupcake.
With rainbow sprinkles The color of our flag.
Thanks, guys, but ever since Rocco dumped me, I can't eat a thing.
It's like I'm becoming "manorexic".
I know.
Breakups are hard.
Especially after all the time you and Rocco spent together.
You know, both days?
I'll never get over this.
Gosh!
Come on!
That's not the Jackie I know.
You take a lickin', and you keep on tickin' So you can keep on lickin'.
Maybe I should eat a little bit of that cupcake.
You really shouldn't use food to suppress your pain.
Yeah.
thanks for bein' so supportive, G. But right now I just kind of wanna be alone with my thought.
I should probably help with the check.
What sounds better at a party?
"I just got back from Bora Bora," or "I just got back from the coast of Australia"?
And before you answer, keep in mind that with Australia there's lots of opportunity for puns on the phrase "down under".
What are you talking about?
Joe and Larry and I are going on a scuba vacation.
How fun!
Are you gonna take anyone else?
Hint, hint.
You mean someone who'd spend a 13-hour plane flight going "What's that?
What's that noise?
What's that"?
!
Well, you know The sound of 50 packets of nuts being opened at the same time sounds a lot like a wing falling off.
I gotta pee like a racehorse.
I don't mean a lot.
I just mean throwing my mane back and snorting.
Oh, my God!
I was just thinking about you.
- No, you weren't.
- No, I wasn't.
God, it's been so long.
How are you?
How's charlie?
Oh, you know, I don't know.
We kind of drifted apart.
He moved to San Francisco a couple years ago met a guy at a Pottery Barn had a glass of chardonnay and poof!
Instant couple.
What?
You guys were best friends.
You did everything together.
Oh, gosh.
I still remember that Halloween when he went as Cindy Crawford and you went as her mole.
What happened?
Nothing happened.
You know, gay man, straight woman.
It's not like we had anything holding us together You know, like a house or kids.
You must've been through something like that with Will.
We're still together.
Roommates, havin' fun, doin' stuff.
No offense, sweetie, but I know how to keep my gay man.
Well, good for you.
I guess you and Will are the exception.
- I guess.
- I have to go.
- Definitely call me.
- I will.
- No, you won't.
- No, I won't.
Another cupcake.
You just missed Heidi Dauro.
- No way.
- Yeah.
You know, she doesn't talk to Charlie anymore.
He just up and moved to San Francisco.
Well, good for him.
Why good for him?
I don't know.
What did he have keeping him here?
- Good-bye.
- Wait Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
We haven't filled in the crossword puzzles with dirty answers yet.
I know, but I want to be early for my scuba class.
When I get there late, I get the bad wet suit.
You put it on, it makes that "pbbbt" sound, and everybody giggles.
Will, come on.
Put the stuff down and come sit with me.
- What?
Say again.
- I really need to talk to you.
The creature from the hot lagoon.
Make it quick.
I'm sweaty in places I never even knew existed.
The other day I was thinking that You and I have been friends for a long time All right.
Enough.
I want to talk to you.
You know, these things make everything look bigger.
Good.
You can take it on your next date.
I was thinking that you and I should invest in something together.
Like what?
Your debt?
No.
Something for the both of us.
- Just tell me what you're thinking.
- I'm not thinking of anything specific.
- Where do you want the piano?
- Over there.
Any thoughts at all?
Of course.
The perfect investment.
Matching guys in weight belts.
Hey.
Guys in rubber suits shouldn't throw stones.
Thanks, guys.
You bought a piano?
No.
I can't afford a piano.
We bought a piano.
Before you freak out Really, between the two of us, it's really not that expensive And I think it would be really great for us to own something together.
The piano is perfect.
In my family, no matter how far away we got from each other or how much we fought the piano always brought us back together again There was one time my family fought and got real far away from each other.
We called it the Eighties.
I don't know, Kar.
I've never felt a pain quite like this.
They tell you to stretch before love.
I didn't listen But I have found that it helps to throw myself into my writing.
You can write?
You know I'm a writer.
I completed three short novels by the time I was ten.
In fact, my first one, "Forbidden Fort From Cushions" received critical acclaim from my nana.
- Honey, are you wearing base?
- A little bit.
So, I've decided to write my relationship with Rocco the way it should have been.
I'm turning my pain into art.
"To Weep and To Willow, a Harlequeen Romance".
- You want me to read you some?
- You can read?
A little bit.
Here it goes.
"Christian awoke with a start.
There was Giovanni, looming large At least from the side view.
His eyes, black as sin and burning with lust.
Christian felt his man heat rise within his being.
Suddenly, Giovanni seized his mouth, devouring his soul.
Their tongues struggled to find each other in a wildly ravishing kiss that ripped through Christian like a bolt of lightning".
Cheese and rice, that is so hot!
There are places I re member all my life.
Though some have change changed changed Yeah!
That is good!
I can't believe what a good piano player you've become in just four or five days.
I have you to thank for that video, "How to Become a Good Piano Player in Just Four or Five Days".
This is so fun.
- Gotta go.
- What?
Where are you going?
We got plans.
A bunch of us are gonna go see cute guys in their underpants.
That's actually the name of the play.
What's it about?
I don't think we care.
So, what?
You're just gonna blow me off?
Look I didn't say anything Thursday night when you made me skip going to the gym so we could work on our Elton John-Kiki Dee number and I didn't say anything last night when you kept me up till three a.m. learning the Mikado.
By the way, do you have any idea how hard it is to get "three little maids from school are we" out of your head?
But tonight, I just want to do something else.
But the piano will miss you.
I will miss you, Will Sometimes you think something's gonna be really cute and then it just turns out kind of creepy?
I will see you later.
Fine I don't know why we bought this thing if you weren't gonna play it.
Grace, what is going Are you ok?
Yeah.
yeah, I'm fine.
It's just a little case of "pianis interruptus".
No, I'm fine.
I'll see you later.
Three little maids from school are we, filled with the br Damn it!
"Giovanni's fingers tore wildly at the lacings" "of my seafoam green polar fleece".
"Like some fantastic farm animal, he grunted and whispered" "Tonight, my love" "you will see the face of God".
"Christian closed his eyes and received him hungrily".
Lord, this is hot.
Do you know if Joseph Aldi happened to call and say what he thought of my design for the breakfast nook?
"He shuddered and screamed out, I am reborn"!
I knew the marble countertop would be a big splash.
Karen, can I ask you something?
Oh, yeah.
Give it to me.
Will and I bought this piano together and for the first couple of days, it was great, but now - it seems like he's bored with it.
- Ooh!
ouch!
Like last night He just up and walked out in the middle of our sing-along.
Filthy beast!
Well, that's a little strong.
Give it right back to him.
You know what?
I will.
You know, he doesn't understand how important this piano is.
That's it!
That's the stuff!
If you're gonna bring something into your life, you have to invest some time into it.
Yes.
It's a commitment, and that means both people have to be committed to it - Right?
- Yes!
I'm not gonna let him just walk away from this.
I'm gonna protect what's important in my life.
Thanks for your support, Karen.
I feel better.
Grace, when did you get here?
Honey, your words are rocking my world and my pants.
Why aren't you typing, you big, merry sissy?
I don't need to write anymore.
Rocco and I are back together.
No, Jack, I need these pages.
I'm getting so many images from this stuff sex with Stan has gone from "I've got a headache" to "I've got to have it"!
Sorry, Kar, no can do.
But, honey, I've got to know what happens next.
I'm addicted to these stories which is odd, because I don't have an addictive personality.
Even if I wanted to write something, I couldn't, 'cause I'm happy now.
Pain was the coal that fueled the choo-choo of my art.
What are saying, honey?
If you If you weren't with him, I'd have my stories?
Probably, but I am with him.
- But if you weren't - But I am.
- But if you weren't - But I am.
- But if you weren't - But I am.
Three little maids from Damn it!
Listen.
About last night.
Thanks for understanding.
You know, I just needed to be around people.
I know.
I was just being selfish.
Of course you should see your friends.
I'm glad you feel that way, 'cause you know I'm going out again tonight.
Oh, I know.
You gotta have friends, right?
- That's right.
- Hit it!
'Cause you gotta have friends.
The feeling's oh, so strong.
Surprise!
Hi, friends, and Mr. Zamir.
- What's going on?
- What's going on?
You don't have to go out because I brought your friends to you for an old-fashioned piano party.
It's kind of like an old-fashioned bore except it has the words "piano" and "party" in it.
Ladies and gentle-ladies I would like to dedicate a song to my Rocco The love theme from "A Man and a Woman" or as I like to call it, "Two Men".
Why did you throw me a piano party when you knew I was going out?
'Cause it's so much more fun.
This way you can bring your friends to the old-fashioned piano party, and, really - Will, everyone loves an old-fashioned piano party.
- Please stop saying "old-fashioned piano party".
There's no such thing as an old-fashioned piano party.
Just because you keep saying "old-fashioned piano party" doesn't mean it exists!
I have to tell you, this is a great old-fashioned piano party.
Even better than the ones my mom used to throw.
I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable, and I don't know why.
You know what we need to do?
- Our Captain and Tennille number.
- No.
Not even if I get to be Tennille.
What's the matter with you?
You're acting like a nutball.
My mistake An old-fashioned nutball.
Honey, I'm desperate.
What's it gonna take to get you to break up with Jack?
Well, I really love him, so I guess my kids won't have their "pay off the bully" money tomorrow, but But that's ok, 'cause I'm the bully!
Get out of here.
Get out.
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough That's enough!
Time for root beer floats.
That should get Will into the spirit of the old-fashioned piano party.
Count me out, Grace.
Joe's been very upset with my love-handles or as he calls them, "I don't want to touch you, Larry".
Come on, Larry, let's go.
It's margarita madness at Crisco Disco.
- That sounds fun.
- Larry, you and Will aren't going out, are you?
- Fine.
I'll go alone.
- Everybody!
Will really wants to play the piano, but he's a little shy.
Maybe you can give him a little help, ok?
I don't want to play the stupid piano.
Come on, Will.
Your wife went through a lot of trouble.
Come on.
Play.
She's not Everybody, root beer floats.
Come and get it.
Will?
No.
I'm getting out of here.
Where the hell are my keys?
What is your problem?
Why are you totally bailing out on this piano?
I'm not!
What, do I have to play it every second?
Yes, you do.
Now, sit your ass on the bench of the piano that we bought together, sip your root beer float, and have some friggin' fun!
- What?
- There they are.
I was gonna say, "be careful".
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
- Should we go?
Look what you did!
You ruined it!
You ruined everything!
We should go.
Grace, I'm sorry, but it's just a piano.
No, it's not.
It's more than that, but you just don't realize it, so just forget it!
Just go!
Just move to San Francisco and go scuba diving for cute guys in underpants 'cause obviously, there's just nothing keeping you here!
Have you been gargling with bong water?
We're drifting apart, Will.
People do.
It happened to Heidi and Charlie.
They don't even talk anymore.
Oh, my god!
Is that what this is all about?
Grace, we are always going to be in each other's lives.
How do you know that?
Things change.
You're gonna get a boyfriend.
- I'm gonna get a boyfriend.
- Hopefully not the same boyfriend.
We're not a couple.
We're not married.
We don't have kids.
What do we have to keep us together?
Love.
- Love will keep us together.
- Don't do that.
You know, there are a million things that could pull us in a million different directions.
Think of me, babe, whenever.
- And then we'll end up talking less and less.
- Some sweet-talking guy comes along - singing a song - Don't do this.
We're talking about our friendship here.
Don't mess around.
You've just gotta be strong.
You know what?
Doing this stupid song is not gonna take away my concerns, ok?
- Just stop.
- Stop!
'Cause I really love you.
- Stop.
- Stop I've been thinking of you.
Look in my heart and let love keep us together.
Well, I must say, this is the best old-fashioned piano party I've ever been to.
And, you know, this thing is going back tomorrow.
First thing in the morning.
Yeah.
Still creepy.
There you are.
Penny for your thoughts.
- I'm dumping you.
- What?
- It's just not working.
- Why?
I don't know.
Karen didn't tell me why, but it's not.
Good night, Jack.
Honey, what's going on?
What's happening?
Are you ok?
Karen, Rocco just dumped me.
Oh, honey, that's terrible.
My heart is cleft in twain.
You must be devastated.
Here.
Why don't you try writing through your pain.
When last we left him, Giovanni was staring at the stable boy and feeling a familiar tightening in his pants.
Go.
I know you made him dump me.
What'd you do, pay him 50 bucks?
Did he say that?
Who are you gonna believe?
Me or some street trash I paid 50 bucks to to dump ya?
I will never forgive you for this And as for more writing Well, you just forget it.
How about if I pay you 100 bucks?
You know, that is so low.
It hurts that you would try to bribe me.
It causes me a lot of pain.
I have no choice but to write through that pain.

Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Remember that ultra-hip club, the Atom Bar?
I'm not revealing my sources but apparently it is re-opening this Friday.
Hello, "Day-Old News"?
Yeah, I'd like to cancel Will Truman's subscription.
Yeah.
he's going to be giving his business to "Behind the Times".
Ok.
Ok, ok.
Ok.
I love you, too.
You knew Why wouldn't you tell me?
Because you know how you are at these things.
You stand in a corner, pretending to be waiting for somebody.
"Where is my fake person?
I told my fake person to be here at 9:00 sharp.
You never have any fun.
Come on, you're just like a little willflower.
You're right.
But that was the me of the past.
The me of the future is totally different.
Yeah?
How?
I'm gonna make my fake person Italian.
Will, I need quarters.
Well, I'm plumb out.
But I imagine Boss Hog and the Hazard boys might have two bits.
It's laundry day, ok?
It was either this or a peach bridesmaid dress, and I've been wearing that all day.
Oh, um, there's a roll of quarters in my top drawer right beside my eye cream and my pedicure kit.
My dad would be so proud of me.
Help me.
Hide me.
She's after me.
What's the matter, does your stepdaughter want a hug?
No, fruit loop.
Stanley's mother's in town.
You gotta let me hide out here.
She'll never think to look for me in government-assisted housing.
She just makes you want to give, doesn't she?
Look at me.
I got the shakes and for all the wrong reasons.
Karen, I haven't seen you this freaked out since you turned 42.
1!
34-2-1!
Pretty girl, pretty girl!
Pretty girl.
Karen, wouldn't it be better to just to learn to deal with her?
Think about it.
She's the mother of the man whose bank account you love.
That relationship's not gonna go away.
I see where you're going with this, Wilma but I can't have her whacked.
Oh, God.
Just knowing she's in town it just consumes me completely.
I get I feel like I can't think about anything else.
Hey, Kar.
Look who put the ho in hoedown!
Oh, thank you, honey.
Your little costume sure brightened my day.
What is this?
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it.
Someone took my wet laundry out of the dryer and put theirs in.
That is like the rudest thing Did you do this?
- No.
- Well, then who did?
I was thrown out of my country for informing on my neighbor.
So you're not gonna tell me?
Yes, I am.
The guy in 12C.
God bless America!
Excuse me.
Did you take someone's clothes out of the dryer and put yours in?
Yes, I did.
Those clothes were mine.
Listen, I can't get into this right now.
I'm in the middle of a project.
Hey, buster, I'm in the middle of a project, too.
It's called my life.
You know what, I'm making a mix tape.
And if this Alice Cooper song runs out the whole tape is ruined.
Wait, that's your project?
A mix tape?
No, a mix tape is not a project.
It's something you do between bong hits, and Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Hey, hey!
Never do that!
Never do that!
This is my work!
I wouldn't come into your dairy and unplug the milking machine.
Ok, all right.
You know what?
What you did down in the laundry room is unacceptable.
- Taking my clothes out - Hey, you're a girl.
What is the most romantic Megadeath song?
- What?
- I had a big fight with my girlfriend.
She says I'm aimless and don't have any ambition so I decided to make her this tape: "Heavy Metal Songs of Love and Devotion".
Hey, good plan.
Yeah, you know, I always thought that if Humphrey Bogart had just made Ingrid Bergman a mix tape she never would've gotten on that plane.
What, you're gonna give me relationship advice?
Yeah, that's what I need.
Then maybe I could find some nice gay guy to live with for the rest of my adult life.
You know what?
I'm going to accept that as an apology for my laundry.
I got your message.
What do you need?
Two tickets to the opening of the Atom Bar tonight.
- Oh my god!
Oh my god!
- I'd love to!
We're going!
We're going!
- Mr. D.J., put a record on - I wanna dance with my baby.
Music makes the people come together!
Jack, Jack.
No, no, Jack, Jack.
Jack.
Jack.
Don't do that part.
Hello, boys.
Got a little surprise for ya.
Hide the crucifixes.
Beelzebooze is here.
Oh, honey.
I got a fake laugh with your name all over it.
Now I want you to meet my mother-in-law, Sylvia Walker.
Haul it in here, Syl.
Nice to meet you.
May I sit down?
Be my guest.
That's the dragon lady?
That little pocket person is the one who strikes fear in your in your heart facsimile?
Well, I might have been exaggerating a little bit but, you know, I thought about it, and you're right.
Getting along with people, like Madison Avenue is a two-way street.
Madison Avenue is a one-way street.
Oh!
Well, that explains why those two cops had Driver in a choke hold last night.
But you know what, the Goiter and I had a long talk and, she's not such a bad old bird after all.
Right, Syl?
What's that, dear?
Oh, she's thinkin' about her friends in the Lollipop Guild.
You know, she was a U.S.O. girl in the war between the states.
Oh, Wilma, be a love and get a little snicky snack for Syl, ok?
Just a little birdseed and some sugar water.
You can put it anywhere.
She'll find it.
I just don't get it.
I can't believe someone as big as Stan came out of that tiny little woman.
Well, I'm no expert, but I read an article once in Skymiles magazine.
Apparently, when they come out, they're much smaller.
The whole thing's a horror.
It's nice to see Karen, you know, put in a little effort.
You know, I knew if she just reached out to her Karen?
She took off.
Well, what are we gonna do?
We have to be at the club in less than an hour.
And I still need time to soak and spritz before I can sizzle.
Jack, relax.
She's coming back.
Karen might be evil but she's not gonna stick us with her mother-in-law for the rest of the night.
- Could I get a kamikaze?
- Rum and Coke, please?
Hot tea, please.
So, Syl, um, let me ask ya.
Do you ever regret throwin' that big blue diamond in the bottom of the water where the Titanic went down?
Karen's not answering.
Did you try her garter phone?
She has a garter ph What is she, one of the x-men?
Hey, when clubbing, I put my phone in my underwear.
Yeah, that's just so when it rings, you can say, "wanna grab that"?
It is true.
Here's the number, but you should know, it's only for real emergencies like if Sunny Von Bulow comes to and starts pointing fingers.
I can see you.
Karen Walker's panties.
Karen, we're down at the Atom Bar.
Get over here and pick up your mother-in-law.
I will when you get over here and pick up your mother-in-law!
- I don't have a mother-in-law.
- Then the deal's off!
You try.
Hey, Kar.
Yeah, listen.
You got to come pick up the Goiter, ok?
Well, see, we're at this huge party, and it's especially important to Will because he has the opportunity to have his very first gay experience.
I know!
I know.
I know.
Karen, I am not kidding around.
Get your gin-soaked ass in your vodka-soaked limo and pick up your tea-soaked mother-in-law.
All right, all right.
Don't get your training bra in a twist.
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
Thank you.
Sometimes you just have to be a little tough with her.
- She's not coming, is she?
- No.
You know, something you said yesterday really stuck in my craw.
What's a craw?
I don't know.
I think it's something like a claw.
- Why didn't you just saw claw?
- Can we move past this?
Sure.
"Crum" right in.
We'll "crawk" about it.
Ok, look.
What you said about me and my roommate was totally off-base.
I'll have you know that my relationship with Will is very healthy.
We talk about everything.
We spend every spare minute together.
We don't date anyone that the other one doesn't approve of.
That doesn't sound very healthy, but it's really more of a checkoff system.
- Boy, I really got to you, didn't I?
- No.
I don't give a crap what you think.
Then why are you up here?
I could ask you the same question.
Not really.
I live here.
You know what?
I'm going to accept that as an apology for what you said about me and my roommate.
You mind "crosing" the door?
So, Sylvia, you having a good time?
Oh, lean in, dear.
There's a little something And the night's complete.
It's official.
We're dating.
Which one?
The one on the right or the one on the left?
Yes.
It's amazing.
I'm a lawyer, I'm a nice guy, and I get no one.
Jack eats Ho-Hos with chopsticks keeps a phone in his pants, he gets everyone.
Why do I keep putting myself through this?
It's the same old letdown every time.
Of course it is, dear.
How do you expect anything in your life to change if you don't change?
Well, because You don't he gullet of a bird or insect.
- What?
- Craw.
That's what a craw is.
Well, now I can finish my Cheerios without wondering "why are we here"?
- Look, I gotta go.
- What, you got another project?
As a matter of fact, I do.
You know, I'm still trying to get Vicki back so I'm making her name out of pap-i-er-mâché.
Out of what?
You know, pap-i-er-mâché the French art of paper sculpture.
It's "paper mâché," you pretentious boob.
And do you really think that is going to win her back?
Yep.
Oh, God.
Boy, do you have a lot to learn about women.
I mean, tons.
A lot.
Much.
Plenty to learn.
Well, I know this much about women.
When they hover in your doorway muttering tiny words they're waiting for you to ask for their advice.
Wrong.
- What's your advice?
- Romance her.
That's what women want.
Do something that will take her breath away and I'm not talking about shoving her face in your hamper.
- Another round.
- Hey.
Will Truman, right?
Riverside Drive, Mastercard expires March 2003?
I knew these pants were tight.
I didn't think you could read the contents of my wallet through them.
Scott.
I'm the assistant manager at Gayle and Patty's Video.
Hey.
Hey, listen, so if you remind me the next time you come in, I'll give you a free microwave popcorn.
I appreciate that.
I really don't think I'm gonna come in and say, "Hey, remember me?
You promised me a free package of Pop Secret".
There's a Cassavetes double feature at the Film Forum one where Gena Rowlands is drunk and crazy the other where she's crazy and drunk.
Do you want to go?
Maybe get some dinner afterwards?
- I don't know.
- Why not?
Well, for one thing, in the Eighties, when I was wearing safety pins to look cool, you were wearing them to stay dry.
Give me a break.
I'm 24 years old.
What are you, 27?
Yes, I am.
But You're totally cute, but I just don't really see this You know, I usually go out with You know what?
yes.
Let's go out tomorrow night.
Cool, so around 10:00?
in bed for four hours.
Ok, 9:00, we'll go out.
You have your own Razor scooter, right - I'm kidding.
- That was a good one.
Sylvia?
That's on me.
I took your advice, and I have got a date tomorrow night.
Oh Good for you, dear.
I gotta be honest.
You know, at first, I was furious with Karen that she stuck us with you but the truth is, if it weren't for you, I probably wouldn't have met that guy.
- Guy?
- Yeah.
- Scott.
- You're a fag?
- What?
- I helped a fairy get a date?
Oh, I'm going to hell!
it's over with those two, but I met my rebound couple, Bob and Chuck.
- You're queer, too?
- As Christmas in Bloomingdale's, girlfriend.
Oh!
Oh, help, police!
Oh, I'm surrounded by homos!
- Homos, homos, homos!
- Just quiet down, Sylvia.
Get away from me, you fruit!
Oh, I'm a fag hag!
Excuse me?
Did you put your underwear in with my laundry?
I needed to get you up here.
Ever hear of a Post-It?
Yeah, but then my underwear would still be dirty.
Hi.
Look at you.
You've gone from pig to Pygmalion.
- What do you want with me?
- I just wanted to get your opinion.
Yeah, Vicki always wanted to go to Venice, so I thought I can't believe it.
It's amazing.
- Yeah.
- You can practically smell the canals.
Well, that's probably just the sheets.
Come, sit down.
I want you to get the total experience.
Just kidding.
Here ya go.
Would you care for some wine?
ok.
So Do you like this?
Yeah.
What are we doing?
Well I just thought we'd have a nice little evening.
But I thought that all of this was for Vicki.
Well, she saw all this, it didn't work for her, she blew me off, I kicked her out.
Anyway, here's to us.
What?
Are you out of your mind?
Are you actually offering me a used night in Venice?
Look, I'm sorry No, no, no, hey.
Look, ever since You know, ever since you started yelling at me I can't stop thinking about you and besides, Vicki and I were never really right for each other.
She doesn't get me.
I need to be with someone who gets me.
I don't get you.
Yeah, but in a totally different way.
I don't You are..
I I am horrified!
How could you think that this would work?
do you see what you're offering me?
A sloppy second gondola a half-empty bottle of wine a calzone with the sauce licked off the top.
Is this your idea of romance?
You know nothing about women.
I am so offended, I don't even know what to say.
One date.
- Who is it?
- Tanqueray delivery.
Oh, thank God.

You know, you're only gonna make the Dirt Devil jealous.
It's more vacuum action than you've gotten lately.
Yeah, well, it's only 'cause you hide all the good attachments.
Oh, look!
your mom's monthly newsletter.
Amazing.
My mother's still afraid of call waiting but she can put together a monthly mailing with three colors and a Yiddish word jumble.
Let's see what's on nutsy's mind this month.
"My husband Martin had his yearly colonoscopy.
Don't worry.
Clean as a whistle".
A whole thing here about Alice Robinson.
Do you know her?
God, I haven't heard that name in years.
You know how every school has that one girl that all the kids make fun of?
You know, bad at sports, a little overweight friends with the lunch ladies?
I was that girl.
Poor Alice.
We did Model U.N. together and we were Madagascar and Alice had this speech impediment, so she said, "Madagathcar".
The kids just tortured her.
They called her "Mrs. Lazy Face".
Not me.
I was always very nice to her, but they were just awful.
- "Hi, my name ith Alith Robinthon".
- Grace "And I'm the ambathador from Madagathcar".
Grace "But you can call me Mrs. Lathy Fathe".
It was pretty funny.
"Madagathcar".
"Security counthel".
She's dead.
Ah, thit.
Karen!
finally you're here.
Honey, this had better be important.
I was home reading to my kids.
Oh, can you imagine?
So what's up, snicker poodle?
My one man show, Jack 2001 has been nominated for Are you ready for this?
A MAC award.
A MAC Award, a MAC Award, did he say MAC Award?
Yes, a MAC Award!
- Oh, my god, a MAC Award?
- Can you believe it?
A MAC award!
Oh, can you believe it?
A MAC award!
Honey, what the hell's a MAC Award?
Only the most prestigious award in all of lower Manhattan non-transgender equity waiver gay cabaret.
Well, Jack, that is fantastic.
We should celebrate.
- I know.
I wish I had some champagne.
- Yeah.
Here you go, sweetie.
- Fantastic.
Now all we need is - Yeah.
Listen, Karen, since this award means so much to me and since you had such a big part in the success of Jack 2001 I would be honored if you came as my escort.
Oh, honey, that is so sweet.
No.
- Why?
- No reason.
Listen, why don't you take those twins you've been dating?
We broke up.
They were seeing somebody else.
Besides, there might be press there and I don't want to be typecast as gay.
My sessuality is my business.
Honey, the award is for gay cabaret.
Yeah.
Still, you want to keep them guessing, you know.
This is so tight.
Now I know why Evita was such a bitch.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Farrah Fawcett-Majors, I've got it!
The truly cool people never show up at the awards show at all.
They just send a videotaped acceptance speech from some exotic location where they're making their next movie.
That's what I'll do!
Yeah.
But where am I gonna get a video camera?
Here you go, honey.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm trying to wake you up.
With what, your breath?
No, no.
You know how I told you about Alice Robinson and her nickname "Mrs. Lazy Face"?
- You gave her that nickname?
- How did you know?
I didn't.
I'm just trying to move things along.
How did it happen?
Well You know how I'm really good at improv?
Go on.
It was the biggest event of the year the school's stand-up comedy contest.
Where did you go to school, Don Rickles Junior High?
Anyway, this was my big chance to get in with the cool kids.
So, I'm on stage, and then, all of a sudden, this kid yells, "Do Alice"!
And I knew she wasn't there, so I went "Hi, my name is Alith Robinthson but you can call me Mrs. Lathy Face".
The crowd went wild.
I mean, I killed.
I mean, I totally killed.
That is so wrong.
They really thought you were funny?
Will, I never said I'm sorry, and now it's too late.
Which is why I'm gonna go to Schenectady to her funeral tomorrow and apologize to her dead body.
Wanna come?
Well, gee, that certainly sounds like a good time.
- Please, please, please, Will - Grace, get real!
There is no way that Alice was still carrying that around.
You know, kids get teased, and they get over it.
You're probably right.
I mean, you got over the kids calling you "Harry Ass Truman".
Wake me at 6:00.
And Action!
See it, settle sell it Hi.
I'm Jack McFarland.
I'd love to be at the MAC Awards this evening but I can't.
You see, I'm on the set of my new movie Karen, maybe this was a bad idea.
This doesn't even look like a movie set.
Honey, come on.
Just say what I told you.
Fine.
I'm on the set of my new movie "Poorly Decorated Crackhouse".
Oh Directing is fun.
Keep going.
Keep going.
I'd like to congratulate the other nominees.
After all the You know what, Karen?
This just isn't working for me.
Just doesn't feel right.
I wanna show them I'm sincere but I haven't gotten that far yet in my acting class.
We're still on "Learning how to Listen" which I don't know how to do, so I just open my eyes really wide and nod.
Well, I'm going next-door to get the champagne.
I wish I'd brought something stronger, but I left it in my other coat.
Hi.
It's Jack.
I'm out since 1985.
Kisses!
Hey, Jack, it's Ted from the MAC Awards.
Listen, bad news.
There's been a horrible mix-up.
Unfortunately, Jack 2001 was not nominated.
It's just that there were so many gay cabaret acts with the word "Jack" in them that we got confused.
Anyway, our bad.
Don't be crushed.
Hey, let's get a juice sometime.
Esca-lator!
Welcome.
I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
I actually knew Alice years ago.
There's so many things I wish I had the chance to say to her.
Well, I'm sure she knew how you felt about her.
Let's hope not.
Oh, my God, there's Gabe.
Well, hello, Gabe.
I remember at school everyone used to say that Alice's best feature was her older brother Gabe.
Oh, gosh, he looks so sad.
Sad Oh, my God!
He's wearing Prada shoes.
He's gay.
This is great!
And sad.
Very, very sad.
Will, straight men wear Prada.
Not in Schenectady.
I have to go do this now, Mr. Sensitive.
Hi, Alice.
It's me, Grace Adler - Hi.
- Hi.
God, you know, my grandmother would be so touched if she saw how many people came out today.
I am Alice Robinson.
Nice to meet you.
Oh, Grace - Come on.
Let's get out of here.
- Aren't you going to apologize to Alice?
- I'll catch her at the next reunion.
- I don't believe you!
Will, I am not going to apologize to her now.
She's alive.
It could be really awkward.
I can't What Grace!
What happened to making amends?
You owe this not only to Alice, but to yourself to do the right thing.
I didn't realize you felt so strongly.
Well, I do.
I'm not gonna let you neglect this Hi profound moral responsibility.
You're unbelievable.
You just want me to stay so you could cruise.
Give me a break.
Come on, he's my type!
He's dark and brooding and miserable Everyone is.
It's a funeral!
Yeah.
Go apologize.
He's coming back.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Gabe.
I'm Will.
I'm so sorry about your grandmother.
Yeah, it was quite a shock.
Well, not really that big of a shock.
She was 94 and had a really negative outlook.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's gonna be ok.
You're gonna be ok.
We'll get through this together.
Hi, Alice?
It's me, Grace Adler.
You probably don't even remember me.
We went to Hawthorne Junior High School together a million years ago.
Go Cougars.
Anyway, you probably already knew this, but I was the one who started the whole "Mrs. Lazy Face" thing and I'm sorry.
I feel better.
You bitch!
- Excuse me?
- That nickname followed me through high school, through college, even Harvard Med!
Just last week, I had to tell my fiancé to knock it off.
- But I did - For 20 years I have been afraid to talk because of my lisp.
I've never even seen a single movie with Susan Sarandon or Sissy Spacek.
But through it all, I knew that someday I'd be able to look you in the eye and say very clearly, you suck!
Well, on the bright side, she probably never had to see anything with Sylvester Stallone.
- Honey, I have - Karen, goody, you're back.
I finally figured out my character.
It's a guy who's happy because he won an award.
It just came to me.
It so works.
Let's roll it.
Jack, you need a vacation.
Come on.
when was the last time you and I took off to Bermuda on the sperm of the moment?
Let's go!
Karen, come on.
Let's roll it.
I know, but, honey, I just feel like there's a lot of things we could be doing - besides making a stupid video - Karen!
We are doing this.
Now, don't make me get all Whitney on your ass.
Ok?
I'm in my zone.
Let's roll it.
All right.
And action.
Hi.
I'm Jack McFarland.
You know, sometimes I ask myself why am I in this crazy business of show, anyway?
Do I do it for the money?
Do I do it for the glory?
Do I do it for the himbos who wait at my dressing room door?
No, no And yes.
But more than anything else, I do it for love because this is what I love to do.
Oh, my god, Karen.
I just realized something.
This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me.
Forget the video camera.
I'm going to the MAC Awards.
Honey, you didn't get nominated.
What?
Somebody called from the MAC awards.
Ted Homosexual.
He said that there was some kind of a mix-up, and you didn't even get nominated.
It's ok.
It's just a stupid award, anyway.
I'm sorry, Jackie.
Can you shut the camera off?
I just kind of want to be alone right now Now, I would like to call up anyone who would like to share a few words.
All right, I got to get out of here.
You have exactly ten minutes to make your move on this guy.
That'll give me enough time to get over to my mother's have her tell me I look awful in black, and get back here.
Oh, yes.
You, dear, please.
You said you wanted to say something.
What No, no.
That was when I thought she was dead.
No, no.
Come on.
I think you should come down and say something.
I insist.
Well Where to begin.
Alice Robinson was So, here's to you, Mrs. Robinson.
Jesus loves you more than you will know.
And now, Alice has Crossed that bridge over troubled water And is hopefully feeling groovy - No longer homeward bound - Stop it!
Sorry Alice Alice was Alice was She was She was very forgiving.
She was not the kind of person who would hold a grudge over some childish nickname.
We all had those, right?
I had plenty Like "Gross" Adler.
- And Gosh, what was that other one?
- Flatsy Patsy.
- Right.
thank you.
- Bigfoot.
- Ok.
- Mop Top, Scarlet Pimple.
Stop it.
My point being that I I know what it feels like to be made fun of, and I know it's not a good feeling.
So, if Alice was here today, all I'd really want to say to her is I'm sorry if I ever hurt her and wherever she is, I hope she'll forgive me.
This day is hard for all of us.
Yes, it is.
Is Gabe seeing anyone?
Honey, I know not winning that award was a big disappointment but believe me, in my eyes, you're a winner.
Yeah.
There's no better mo out there.
I don't care what you think.
I don't care what anybody thinks.
Without a MAC award, I'm nothing!
I thought you might be feeling this way.
So, I racked my rack, and then it came to me.
I'll get him a cute boy to ease his pain.
But then I thought "No" "Jackie's not that shallow".
And then I thought "Hey, diamonds are a girl's best friend.
I'll get him jewelry"!
But then I thought "No" "Jackie's a lot more complicated than that".
And then it hit me.
"Nothing takes the sting out of failure like a big, fat check.
I'll give him money".
But then I thought "No" "My Jackie can't be bought.
He's an artist.
He has brought joy to fives and tens of people with his cabaret act.
That's what's really important to him".
I guess you're right.
I fooled you!
Check it out, Jackie.
The dude, the diamonds, and the dough.
Honey, you're simple, you're shallow, and you're a common whore.
That's why we're soul mates.
Oh, Karen.
You're my best friend in the whole world.
- Thanks for coming, Will.
- Oh, no problem.
I hope this isn't forward or inappropriate, but, you know, I thought we sort of made a connection before you know, and we had that great hug, and Can I call you sometime?
Are you hitting on me at my grandmother's funeral?
- Well, I just - Have you no shame?
I'm embarrassed for you.
- Let's keep our voices down.
- He's hitting on me.
Anyway, I really appreciate what you said today.
It took a lot of guts to come here and say that.
Well, thank you for understanding.
I teach a speech therapy class in the city a couple days a week and, you know, maybe we could get together and have a drink sometime.
I would really love that.
Hey, you know, in fact, some of my students are here today.
Would you like to meet them?
- Sure.
- Ok.
Be careful.
that coffee's very hot.
Oh, hot, hot!
Grace Adler, this is Cindy, this is Jason, and this is Sarah.
Hi, Thindy.
Hi, Jathon.
Hi, Tharah.
You bitch!

Well, this is it.
Thanks for walking me home.
It was fun.

He just said that because you're older than me.
Yeah, I got that part.
Can I come up?
I don't know, Scott.
My roommate might be home.

- Who You're a child.
You are totally inappropriate.
You have no self-control.
What are you talking about?
At dinner, you went "ptttb", and turned to the table next to us and said "Can you believe that came out of her"?
Hey, so, do you have those Breathe-Right strips?
'Cause you look like a snorer to me.
Look, you don't have to worry about it because you're not coming in, ever.
Besides, my roommate might be home.

I'm glad you liked it.
You know, I think the difference was adding a dramatic reading.
Did you enjoy the penis monologues?
I don't know, honey.
I'm not a big fan of ventriloquism.
Constructive criticism.
It's in.
I'm assessing it.
I'm not hearing it.
It's gone.

It's just that, well, you're my world now.
Yeh, about that See the problem is I live here and I'm thinking you live way up here.
Are you sure, honey?
'cause I thought I had a stalker once.
It turns out it was just Rosario running alongside of the limo, banging on it because she got her coat caught in the door.
Yes, Val is totally stalking me.
She followed me to the Banana, she followed me to the gym and last night, I am sitting in the bushes outside Kevin Bacon's apartment and I see Val watching me through the other bushes across the street!
Fun date, huh?
Yeah, nothing spells romance like free soft-drink night at the Pig and Whistle.
Did you have onions in your veggie weggie tub?
No.
Good.
'cause I'm going to kiss you like you've never been kissed before.
Oh!
First of all, I have been kissed like that by my Aunt Honey And, second of all, you don't tell someone that you're about to kiss them.
You sneak up on them when they Yeah, like that.

- I live here.
- No, you don't!
- I'm carrying your baby.
- No, you're not!
- You're a musical genius.
- Ok, I'll give you that one.
- But, Val, you don't - Jack, don't you understand?
When you sing to me You make me feel special.
It's like I'm no longer that sad, angry little girl running around the schoolyard stabbing kids with pencils.
Someone put a little extra crazy powder in the protein shake.
Ok, come on.
We're going to sit down and have a little talk, all right?
Man to whack-job.
I thought that it was very flattering when you first started coming to the show I'm wearing your dirty bath water in a vial around my neck.
Ew, that's enough!
I've had it!
All right?
So I'm going to tell you what Justin Timberlake Matt Lauer and Moesha said to me.
"Stay away, or I'll call the police"!
I pretended that your jockstrap was an oxygen mask all day today.
And time to go, psycho!
- But, Jack, I love you!
- No, I need you to go, Val.
- No!
I love you!
- Get out!
Crazy lady!
- No!
I love you!
- Get out!
- I love you.
- Get out!
You're crazy!

I might as well just buy a dirty magazine.
Don't you find it unbelievably frustrating - when it takes forever to get online?
- Will, just buy a dirty magazine.
You don't know me.
Oh, Karen called.
What?
Karen called?
Did she say anything?
What'd she say?
Did she say anything?
What'd she say?
She said she's on her way over.
She apparently has some great big surprise she wants to share.
Maybe she's found a way to freeze-dry evil so that we can drink it when she's not here.
So, Karen's coming over now?
Shouldn't you leave?
Don't you have something to do?
- Like what?
- Gym?
- Went.
- Eat?
- Poop?
- Twice.
- Lucky.
- Grace What's the matter?
Ok.
all right.
Listen.
You're going to find out anyway as soon as Karen gets here, so You know the guy from the laundry room that you were talking about Nathan?
Oh, what the jerk that sneezed on my neck?
Yeah, what's the latest?
Is he still throwing lizards down the mail chute, then racing them to the lobby?
He is.
- And I'm dating him.
- What?
All right.
Look, before you say anything I know that there are parts of him that are disgusting and childish and weird, but he can also be really sweet and charming and romantic and I know this makes absolutely no sense, and it's probably going nowhere but there it is.
I've been dating sneezy.
Well Since we're sharing, I guess there's something I should tell you.
What?
I'm hurt you should lie to me.
I'm sorry.
I guess I don't know.
I guess I just felt little embarrassed.
Well, excuses.
It's just that it hurts, that's all.
Will, come on.
What could I do to make it up to you?
Oh, it's not a big deal.
You know, what am I supposed to say take out the garbage, do the dishes and pick up the dry cleaning for a month?
Would it make you feel better if I did all that?
It's a place to start.
Hello, kiddies.
Are you ready for your big surprise?
It's too late.
Will already knows.
- About the ring?
- What ring?
Honey, do you remember that afternoon that you and I were walking down Fifth Avenue and we saw that beautiful ring in the window of Tiffany's and you said to me, "If only, one day, I could own a ring like that"?
Yeah I bought it for myself!
Isn't that great?
That's your surprise?
Yeah.
What the hell'd you think it was?
I thought you were going to tell Will that I was dating Nathan.
The hottie who smells like rope?
You know what?
Shame on you, Grace.
I would think that by now you would know me well enough to know that I am not the kind of person who trades in gossip and I'm hurt that you think I do.
- I'm sorry.
- Your business is your business just the same way it's Will's business that he's dating that mouseketeer from the video store.
That what?
You know, I can pick up the dry cleaning.
And I can take out the garbage.
The dishes are mine and you know what?
Starting next month I'm going to pay you to live here.
Something's very wrong if if we're this embarrassed about our boyfriends I do.
We shouldn't be seeing these guys, should we?
Probably not.
I guess I'll go down to the video store and see if can catch Scott at recess.
Lucky you.
Yours has a job.
I think it's better if we don't see each other anymore.
If that's what you think.
If that's what you think.
I'm sure I'll see you around.
Damn you.
This has gotta stop, ok?
I mean, for the love of pizza you left me 15 messages already.
Please, please, come in.
I really missed you at the show tonight, Val.
- It just felt empty.
- Oh, really?
Well, too bad because you made your bed, and now I'm not going to lie in it.
Ok, all right.
Well, I'm not going to beg.
- Ok.
Bye.
- Please, come back.
Please, Val!
- Oh, Jack, forget it!
You're insane.
- Please.
I need to come back!
- Oh, Jack.
- Please, stalk me!

- Jack 2001.

How's the letter to your daddy coming, poodle?
Just got to give it a little kiss a little spritz a little kiss a little spritz.
You know, we've narrowed down the identity of Jack's father.
It's either one of the eleven Black brothers of New Canaan, Connecticut or Paul Lynde, the center square.
So I'm writing to each one of the brothers and here's what I have so far "Dear Mr. Black, my name is Jack McFarland, M.D." Please hold all comments till the end!
"If you were at a costume party in 1968 wearing a Nixon mask and had sexual relations with a woman who was dressed as the back part of a horse you're my father!
Please understand that I am not asking for money".
Yeah.
I know, right?
"My phone number is" blah blah.
"You can call me between the hours of" blah and blah.
"Sincerely" blah, blah, blah.
"Oh, P.S. " blah.
So what do you think?
I'd replace the first blah with the second blah, and I think the letter's ready to go.
I'm rethinking my scuba outfit for the trip.
'Cause Joe and Larry are gonna be all in basic black and I've got red flippers and a yellow snorkel.
Even the clownfish are gonna be like, "Mmm, too busy".
Oh, my god.
There he is.
Don't look around like a crazy person.
Who?
where?
Who?
where?
there?
Was it the simplicity of the instructions that confused you?
Over at the counter.
What do I call him?
Is he my boyfriend?
My significant other?
How about the man you're afraid to talk to?
That works too.
Now, tell me again how you two didn't end up as a couple?
Well we never met at the gym and one thing didn't lead to another.
Classic boy-doesn't-meet-boy story.
Oh, Lord, what have I done to deserve this?
Oh, right.
Oh, look, honey.
It's your non-imaginary boyfriend.
What's his name Jethro?
Billy Bob?
He's not my boyfriend.
I don't have a boyfriend.
- She dumped that loser.
- No, she didn't.
- Yes, I did.
- She did.
- No, she didn't.
- I said I did.
Sorry, that wasn't meant for you.
Oh, hey, baby.
I didn't know you were here.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Willard.
I like your leotard.
Listen, I'm gonna grab a juice.
I'll be back to smooch on you in a second.
So the whole time you've been dating this guy sneaking around behind my back?
God!
I feel like Captain Von Trapp and you're Liesl making out with that Nazi in the gazebo.
We're not dating.
My God, you overstate everything.
How many times have you seen him?
I don't know.
A couple of times.
Two12 Oh, so that's why when you disappear every night for five hours, you bring me back a little present.
You're just trying to create a diversion so I wouldn't ask you any questions.
Hey, what are you complaining about?
You got some lovely things.
How many compliments have you gotten on that leotard?
It's not a leotard!
It's a fitted-T.
Please, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I've kept this from you.
But what can I say?
I like him.
A lot.
You know, do what you want.
I just Keep him away from me.
Fine.
I just-- God, I just wish that you didn't have this thing with him.
Can't you at least be my friend and say you're happy for me?
I'd like to.
But you know, if he's in your life, he's in my life - and I can't - Not even for some cashmere toe socks?
I've been dying for these!
Karen!
guess what?
I found him!
I found my daddy!
He wrote back!
Oh, peanut, that's fantastic.
What'd he say?
He says his name is Joe, and there's way too much to explain in the letter and that he wants to meet me in person.
Oh, honey, I am so happy for you.
I am gonna throw you a fabulous dinner party so that you can meet your daddy in style.
You'd do that for me?
You'd open your home to me and my family?
Well, when you put it that way no.
We'll do it at Will and Grace's.
Hey, it'll give them a chance to break out the good plastic.
Oh, that was really nice.
I thoroughly enjoyed myself.
You know, I'm gonna write you a little letter of recommendation because that should be on your résumé.
Let me ask you.
How would you rate me?
What do you mean?
On a scale from one to ten.
And remember, the rule is on the first time it's polite to round up.
I'm not gonna rate you.
I don't like it, either, but that's the world we live in.
Oh All right.
Eight.
- You were a seven.
- What?
That's good.
I've never been with anyone above a four.
You're a pig.
Now, let's see if I can bring that score up to 7.2.
I'm not here, I'm not here.
I'm just looking for the phone.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Vicky, the ex.
I'm Grace.
The nude.
Vick, can you give us an hour?
Come back later?
An hour?
Who are you kidding?
I'll be back in five minutes.
I'm gonna get you for that!
Where were we?
Why is your ex-girlfriend still in your apartment?
Don't worry, she's cool.
You're secure enough to handle me living with my ex-girlfriend, right?
Hey, Will.
Nathan's gonna be living here for a while.
Careful.
that's a nasty paper cut waiting to happen.
Three second rule still good.
I'm not happy right now.
See this face?
It's not a happy face.
What was I supposed to do, let him stay up there with her?
It's creepy having a third person around.
You don't say.
Oh, he's using my new Chantal sauté pan with a metal-edge spatula.
There is no way a crèpe is ever gonna slide off that now.
You are more gay before nine A.M. than most people are all day.
All right, hope you guys like my phony bologna free-range omelets.
Ah, yes.
It's only bean curd, but it's got the look of pig.
I thought you gay guys liked the bologna.
I think you're confusing the bologna with the same rights and privileges afforded to married couples.
Will, lighten up.
It's breakfast, not a pelvic exam.
Well, forgive me if I don't leap to take advice from someone whose family portrait includes two bloodhounds and a pickup truck.
Is it just me, or are the squirrels in the park sneakier?
Well, I get it.
Because I'm from the South, I must be stupid and because you're gay, you must be clever.
Just goes to show you how wrong those stereotypes can be.
Boy, if this day gets any better, by noon I should be rolling in glass.
Nathan.
I might have been a little harsh on him.
He does have a flair for "repartee".
This has gotta stop.
You've got to get along with Will.
- I'm just being myself.
- I know, baby.
That's what's gotta stop.
Honey, what is going on here?
There's fingerprints on the China spots on the silver, the vodka is warm.
What is this, junior high?
Now, Jack is meeting his actual father tonight.
Get it together.
Hey, back off or I will force you into brightly colored poly blend.
What's with the gratuitous violence, Hannibal Adler?
Hello, will my moped be safe outside the building?
Yeah.
Miss Karen, thank you for inviting me.
I know that Jack and I aren't married anymore but part of me still thinks of him as family.
Oh, that's sweet, honey, but you're not here to attend the party you're here to work the party.
So, strip off that bug trap you call a jacket put on an apron, and shake hands with Mr. Clean.
Sorry I took so long.
I ran into my imaginary boyfriend down at the market.
He was standing in the checkout line, so I had no choice but to check him out.
Did you talk to him?
I would've, but I was too busy choking on my fear.
Oh, hello, Grace-ious.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that this dinner was formal.
Oh, it's an easy mistake.
I'm sure that's considered formal wear at Señor Frog's.
Well, I guess it doesn't work here at Señor Tightass.
What is he doing here?
I just figured since Jack was meeting his father for the first time tonight, that the whole evening could have a theme Togetherness, you know?
Jack and his father You and Nathan Karen and her drink Thanks for coming.
I love you.
Will, this is a temporary arrangement, and he's important to me so as long as he's here, will you just make an effort?
Please, it would mean so much to me.
Fine, fine, but I'll tell you right now, I am not gonna whittle or tie my pants with a rope.
So, Nathan, tell me, what kind of work do you do?
Oh, I don't work.
I've got my spleen money.
Right, right.
I don't know what that means.
Well, about a year ago, I took a spill on my motorbike wheel came off, I went flying lost a spleen.
The bike company coughed up a butt-load of money and I've been living off of that ever since.
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah, with the market being down the way it is you may want to lacerate a kidney and reinvest.
Well, I've got my IRA.
- What do you do?
- I'm a lawyer.
I'm a man without a spleen.
You're a man without a heart.
Maybe we should take a trip to Oz.
Hello, what's going on?
What'd I miss?
We're just saying what we do for a living.
Oh, bad topic for both of you.
How about things that you have in common likes, dislikes?
Well, I hate making small talk with people that I have nothing in common with.
Me, too.
See?
there you go.
But what I really hate is when someone licks their finger like this And then sticks it in my ear like that.
This has been fun.
Yeah, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go dip my head in alcohol.
Oh, wait for me.
Wait for Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Oh, hey, crunchy.
I don't believe we've met.
Nathan.
I'm Grace's boyfriend.
That's weird.
I'm not getting a gay vibe from you.
So, how you doing, pal?
you ready?
Yeah, I think so.
I did a papaya salt scrub a cucumber mask, a hot oil scalp treatment and two shots of wheatgrass.
Wow, you're more than ready.
You're a gay salad bar.
Everything's food with you, isn't it?
What do you think dad's gonna be like?
Oh, I Don't care if he's rich or poor fat or thin, just as long as he's rich and thin.
Oh, honey, take it from me.
Rich and fat works, too.
Uma Thurman Hawke, he's here!
Ok, I'm gonna answer the door.
No, that'll seem needy, but I am needy, but needy's not hot but I'm hot, so it doesn't matter.
Papa, can you hear me?
Jack, take it easy.
You're having a Yentl breakdown.
Ok.
I'm gonna play it cool and let him come to me.
Hi.
I'm Jo Black.
I'm looking for Jack McFarland.
Daddy!
No, no, there's something I need to explain.
I know, daddy.
You're a woman, but on some level, who isn't?
No, Jack.
No, no.
That's why I wanted to meet you in person.
My name is JoAnne Black.
I'm Joe Black's wife.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Where's my papa?
I am so sorry.
I really don't quite know how to say this, but your father died five years ago.
Will you excuse me for a minute?
Honey, it must be a relief to finally have someone else kill your party.
How you doing?
Come on, Jack.
You've been in here all night.
Come on, talk to me.
Who's the prettiest lady in this room?
Me.
My dad is gone, Will.
I'm never gonna meet him.
He'll never teach me to ride a bike or throw a ball or kiss a man.
I'm totally alone.
Jack, what have you really lost here?
I mean, it would have been great if you'd gotten to know him but he was not part of your life before.
He's not part of your life now.
What's really changed?
But I loved him.
But you didn't know him.
But I loved him.
Maybe you just loved the idea of him.
He was the source of all my talent.
But you don't have any talent.
- But I loved him.
- And here we are again.
Coming in, coming in.
Aam I interrupting anything?
Are you fellas having sex?
- Oh, stop.
- Oh, God.
Well, you know, I figured both of you being gay and all Yeah, that's pretty much how it works.
Just like if you see any woman.
- Yeah.
- Ok, bad analogy.
What do you want?
Well, I thought after what happened tonight maybe Jack could use a little Jack.
Hello.
Thanks, Nathan, but when we're in pain we usually prefer just to talk it out rather than, say, gettin' all liquored up and going down to the dump and shooting rats.
I was thinking more of a memorial of sorts.
You know, when someone close to you dies it's important to remember them, drink a toast, say good-bye.
No, like I said, I don't think that's the way Jack I wanna do it.
- What?
- I loved him.
- But you didn't know him.
- But he loved him, Willard.
Ok.
Why don't you start, Will?
- Oh, I don't know.
I mean - Come on, Will.
For me.
Ok.
I never had the opportunity to meet Joe Black.
Saw the movie, though.
A bit long, didn't care for it Even though it had Brad Pitt in it.
Didn't care for Snatch, either.
The movie.
Anyway Here's to you, Joe.
We hardly knew you.
Actually, we didn't know ye at all.
To Joe.
- Well, thank you, Will.
- Jack, you're up.
First of all, I'd like to say thank you to Joe Black.
Thank you for giving me my piercing blue eyes my impossibly high cheekbones my rock-hard ass And my feminine side Which I did not get from my mother.
In conclusion Papa, how I love you papa how I need you papa how I miss you kissing meeee good niiiiiiiiight - Looking in the sky - To Joe!
Well, terrific.
I'm glad we did that.
It was a nice idea.
Jack, you want to do something?
Maybe go down to the park and laugh at the heterosexuals kissing?
Wait a minute.
I'd like to say something about Joe.
Oh, sorry.
Go ahead.
After all, you knew him as well as we did.
We're born, we grow, we live, we die.
If we're lucky, we have family and friends who know us and love us.
I never knew my dad.
But it doesn't matter.
because wherever we go and whatever we do we can know that the spirit of the mother and the spirit of the father are alive in each of us.
That everything good already exists within ourselves.
So, here's to Joe the father in all of us.
To Joe.
Thank you, Nathan.
Ok, who wants another round?
Oh, my God.
I've turned another one.

{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hey, Will.
Nathan's gonna be living here for a while.
You know, we've narrowed down the identity of Jack's father.
It's either one of the eleven Black brothers of New Canaan, Connecticut or Paul Lynde, the center square.
I hope you guys like my phony bologna free-range omelets.
Ah, yes.
It's only bean curd, but it's got the look of pig.
I thought you gay guys liked the bologna.
I don't know, you maybe stay with Nathan forever.
I can feel it in some of my original bones.
It's just a matter of time before you're driving a mini-van full of screaming kids to K-Mart to pick out curtains for your mud hut in Tarrytown.
Nice to meet you.
Where's my papa?
I am so sorry.
I really don't quite know how to say this, but your father died five years ago.
Oh, my God.
I've turned another one.
Incoming!
How have I lived without phony bologna omelets?
Wait till you try my southern fried I-can't-believe-it's-not-chicken.
- Can we have dinner at 6:00?
- How about dinner at 8:00?
I get too hungry for dinner at 8:00.
That's why the lady is tramp!
Oh, my god.
You did sleep together.
Grace, if you're gonna think I'm gay every time I pass out with men, you're in for a lifetime of heartache.
Hey, little Willie, you have any socks I can borrow?
Both mine are in the wash.
Top drawer.
Help yourself.
There's a small black leather pouch at the back of the drawer.
Just disregard that.
Morning, sickness.
I don't know which one of you it was.
But last night, someone's hand repeatedly brushed up against James and the giant peaches.
That was your hand, Jack.
Ah.
I didn't know I was such a tease.
How are you feeling this morning?
I'm in the third stage of the grieving process.
I'm past anger and denial and into leather.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
What?
Not the scuba trip!
Watch, he's gonna go up an octave.
Come on!
We have been planning this Fine, fine.
Thanks a lot.
No, I don't want to talk to Hannah..
Don't put the kid on.
Don't Hi, Hannah.
Hi.
Your daddies are losers.
Bye.
What?
"I would have sent flowers but they're not as much fun to jump up and down on.
Love, Nathan".
Honey, what's that?
What's going on?
What's happening?
Are you jumping or am I on under-medicated?
I am jumping on my little gift from my boyfriend.
You know what?
If I had your boobs I'd have two black eyes right now.
Yeah.
You'd also have a rich husband.
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking that it's a dopey gift because it doesn't have "Tiffany" or "Cartier" or "may cause drowsiness" on it.
But I will tell you something.
I like Nathan, and I don't care what you think.
So, what do you think?
Oh, honey, where do I begin?
He's crude, he's crass.
Last night at the party he dropped an ice cube down my blouse just so he could fish it back out again.
Oh, honey, I love him.
- Really?
- Yeah, I think you found the one.
- Well, the one for now.
- Oh, pshaw.
Come on.
The only thing to do now is get a blood test pick out a big, white cake and get a copy of "Sloppy Bride" magazine.
Not so fast.
We've only been going out for two weeks.
It took me longer to pick out my screen name and it's "Grace Adler".
I don't know.
I think you're gonna be with Nathan forever.
I can feel it in some of my original bones.
it's just a matter of time before you're driving a mini-van full of screaming kids to K-Mart to pick out curtains for your mud hut in Tarrytown.
And you know what the best part is?
Now, you can start phasing Nathan in and Will out.
Yeah, you know, it's like it says in the Bible.
"When you've got the beau, who needs the 'mo"?
Ok, we have a problem.
I don't see three seats together.
Well, there's two over there, and there's those two there.
All right, I'm gonna ask that couple to move.
Be nice.
What?
I'm always nice.
- Excuse me, I hate to bother you - We're not moving.
You suck.
I hope you're sitting on gum.
I'm sorry.
He's just angry because I'm making him see Chocolat again.
And besides, that seat's broken.
Oh, great.
We can't sit together.
Let's just go see another movie.
No, I don't want to miss Chocolat.
It's magical.
Look, I'll take that one over there, and you guys take these two.
- It's fine.
- All right.
Well We'll see you later and if you need anything, just, you know go get it.
You know, the truth is, I'm glad it's just us because there's something I've been wanting to say to you.
Yeah, I've never been the first one to say this in a relationship, but - I'm just gonna do it.
Grace, I - Oh, will you excuse me a minute?
What?
I need to be sitting next to Will when the candy band plays.
- The what?
- You know, the candy band the ad for the concession when the different types of candy play different instruments and the box of popcorn is out on a date with the sexy soda.
Anyway, Will and I have this little thing that we do when the box of Goobers gets his nose stuck in the screen.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Excuse me.
Oh, gosh!
Ok, someone's gonna need a new soda.
What are you doing here?
You know I don't like to be near you when the candy band comes on.
I think that Nathan is about to say "I love you".
Yeah?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't it too soon?
When he tells you he loves you, that's wonderful.
God, if I could get a guy to say he loved me, I wouldn't be here.
Oh, who am I kidding?
Of course I would.
I love Chocolat.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
If he says "I love you", then that That just starts a whole chain of events in motion and before I know it I'm living in a mud hut in Tarrytown.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Now, just please, get out of here, ok?
I don't want you here when the nose gets stuck.
Go!
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Oh, God.
Someone's gonna need popcorn.
Excuse me.
Hi.
I'm sorry about that.
Now let's just watch the movie.
Oh, hey there, muffin.
How are you doing with this whole dad thing?
Better, I think.
I have light days and heavy days.
Today's a light day.
I could even ride a horse.
Well, I give you credit.
Boy, if I'd spent two years of my life looking for my dad only to find out he's dead I don't think there'd be a pill big enough to kill that pain.
Oh, who am I kidding?
They'd make me one.
Excuse me.
Are you Karen Walker?
Why?
Did her step-son sit on you?
No.
- Did her driver accidentally run you over?
- No.
Are you an employee at one of her husband's - textile factories in Jakarta?
- No.
I'm Karen Walker.
How can I help you?
well, I went to your house because that's the last address I had.
- I'm looking for Jack McFarland.
- Why?
does he owe you money?
No.
Did he steal some of your jokes for his cabaret act?
No.
You missing a scooter you probably weren't using anyway?
No.
Hi, I'm Jack McFarland.
You are?
Wow.
I mean, hi.
I'm Elliot.
Well, what can we do for you, little man?
well, 13 years ago, did you donate your"stuff" to a "stuff" bank called the New York Family Clinic?
Let's see.
I think I did have an account at that bank.
Well, my mom was a nurse there, and she wanted a baby real bad so she took yourdonation.
I'm your son.
I'm gonna talk to him.
I'm gonna talk to him.
Tomorrow, I am gonna talk to him.
Great news.
Guess where we're going on Friday.
To the drugstore so you can stock up on Campho-Phenique?
I'm just going by what we did last Friday.
Ok, I'll give you a hint "We'll always have Paris".
- Paris?
- No!
Casablanca.
Morocco, you ninny!
Look!
two tickets!
I wanted to go to Morocco ever since college!
I know!
Well, I figured, since your scuba trip was canceled it's just a perfect opportunity for us to finally go.
Can you really take the time off?
Well, I talked to my boss, which is me.
She's a bit of a bitch, but then I threatened to quit and she's all, "You can't quit.
You're fired".
And I'm all, "You can't fire me.
I quit".
- Finish this, babe.
- We're going to Morocco!
Three fun-filled weeks!
I've already booked the whole thing with Jeanette the bitter-for-no-reason travel agent.
- Why is she bitter?
- No reason.
God!
Morocco!
This is gonna be great, you know?
We're gonna be rocking the casbah, even if the sharif don't like it.
- What about Nathan?
- What about him?
Well, you guys just started to get serious Isn't it really kind of a bad time to leave?
Oh, Don't worry about Nathan.
He'll be fine.
- Ok.
- Morocco!
Hey, isn't that your imaginary boyfriend?
Yeah.
I'm being coy today, you know?
I'm his coy toy.
I'm his koi pond.
No wonder I'm alone.
I came as fast as I could.
Where's my red chinchilla warm-up suit?
Honey, I lied.
There is no suit.
And I fell for it!
Twice in one day!
Honey, you have a child.
You've gotta start dealing with that.
This again?
Since when do you care so much about family?
Hey!
I'm the one who cared enough about my dying grandfather to walk up a mountain every day to tend to him.
Yeah, even after they took me away to be Clara's companion I never forgot about him, no.
In fact, I got Clara out of that wheelchair just so I could get back to my dear grandpapa.
Karen, that's not you.
That's Heidi.
Oh.
Then what's my story?
Look, my mind is made up.
I don't want to see that kid, ok All right, but I've got a small man in the back who's ready to give you a red chinchilla warm-up suit.
Really?
Come on out, sir!
She did it again!
All right, now get in there.
You two are gonna stay in here till you work something out.
Mr. McFarland, I didn't mean to freak you out.
I just wanted to meet you.
Yeah, well, we don't need to meet, ok?
Because I'm not your father.
But you are.
My mom still has your file.
It says that you were a ballet dancer and model who enjoys long walks on the beach.
That's not me.
And it says that you were part of a performing group called "Jack and the Beanstalk".
That was a solo act!
Listen, Elliot, I can't do this with you, ok?
A kid just does not fit into my "E!
True Hollywood Story".
But I don't want anything from you.
I just thought every once in a while we could, I don't know, hang out or something maybe throw a ball Or watch hockey Or see a Jackie Chan movie?
Dear God!
What has not having a father done to you?
So, what do you think?
Yeah, I Listen, Elliot, I'm sorry, but It's ok.
It doesn't matter.
I mean, what do you care?
You don't know what it's like not to know your father.
Actually, I do.
I didn't know my father, either.
- Really?
- My dad was some anonymous stranger in a Nixon mask who did my mom at a pool party - Who's Nixon?
- I don't know.
Didn't you ever wonder who your dad was, and if he was like you?
Yeah, I used to.
For a while, you know, every drop-dead gorgeous guy I'd see I'd yell "daddy" and see if they turn around.
I used to pretend my dad was Spiderman.
My God, you must be psychic, because I have been known to scale tall buildings to get out of sticky situations.
Well, I've met you.
I guess I should go.
Yeah.
You know, if you're not in a hurry, you maybe wanna go grab a burger or something?
Yeah, I guess.
You buying?
Heh, I was just gonna ask you the same thing.
Hey, it gets pretty chilly out there, so - So, where are you from?
- I'm from Queens.
Yes, you are, but we'll talk about that when you're older.
Ok.
gel, mousse thickener, volumizer wet look, dry look megahold Something in here I don't need.
Oh, shampoo.
Just came to return your socks.
You don't need to wash them.
I only wore them a day or two.
- You just missed your girlfriend.
- You mean ex-girlfriend.
What?
She broke up with me.
She what?
That's impossible!
She didn't say anything to me and she tells me everything.
Obviously not everything.
Did she say why?
Well, she talked for a long time about her life and her future and how I'm macaroni salad and she's kugel with raisins and by the time she started quoting lyrics to "Desperado," I was lost.
Why would she break up with you?
You're sensitive, you're smart, you're funny you've got an ass that won't quit.
It's just so, you know Just it's perfect and round and you just Again, why?
why?
You got me.
Maybe it's like she said "Been out riding fences for so long now".
I mean, I'm a hard one, but I got my reasons.
I Don't know what to tell you.
She's crazy.
And just when you think you've reached the bottom level of her craziness there's a crazy underground garage.
Well, yeah, somebody may have shot out her porch light but I do love her.
Have a nice trip.
- God, finally, you're here.
- Why did you break up with Nathan?
Look, I just wanna get on the plane, go to Morocco and start having some fun.
- Do we have to talk about this right now?
- Yes, we do.
I don't see a future with him, ok?
I'm 27 years old.
I'm not getting any younger.
Really?
Beause in that sentence, you got five years younger.
- Let's go.
- No.
Talk to me!
- I don't wanna talk - Tell me!
- It wasn't working out, ok?
- Why?
- He's weird!
- He's interesting.
- He's childish.
- He's fun.
- He's aimless.
- He could change your life.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Yeah, but why?
I like my life.
I like our thing.
If things start working out with Nathan, then everything's gonna change.
Good!
Grace So it changes.
I just don't want you using me as an excuse for not getting on with your life.
- That's not what I'm doing.
It's just that - Do you love him?
Do I what?
Don't do Fiddler with me.
I'm asking you a question.
Do you love him?
It is not that simple.
Do you love him?
I don't know.
