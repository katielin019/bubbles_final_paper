{START OF EPISODE 2}
- I'm so happy I could plotz.
- Not on the kitchen table.
You can say goodbye to this furry little punim.
What's with all the Yiddish?
Are you going into show business?
I'm online with a camel in Jerusalem who used to be an Amway salesman.
Why'd the Witches' Council turn him into a camel?
He used to be an Amway salesman.
Anyway, he was wandering through the desert and found a scroll that says witches like me can be turned back into their former selves if they're kissed by someone who loves them.
Why can't you just play Solitaire like regular cats?
One little kiss and I can once again be a man.
I'll no longer be a shlemiel.
Salem, don't trust chat rooms.
Besides, you little yutz, who are you gonna get to kiss you?
- Pucker up.
- If I help turn you into a man, the Witches' Council will turn me into a cat.
What a sad, pathetic existence that would be.
Moving on.
I love you, Zelda.
I love you too, but I'm not in love with you.
Oh, Sabrina Not until you find a new way of grooming yourself.
Mean.
There must be somebody out there who's not so stingy with kisses.
Oh, Lord, he's got toilet-water breath.
I feel udderly ridiculous.
Look at all the great stuff I found for Physics.
Our jet propulsion project's really gonna take off.
Not even a mercy laugh.
I just want you to know I'm not one of those creepy girls who drops all her friends just because she's dating a guy.
- You and Justin are dating?
- No.
- He asked you out, right?
- No.
- But you met him, right?
- I don't know.
I've imagined so many conversations with him, I can't separate fiction from reality.
Hey, guys, the soda machine's broken.
You can get all the free drinks you want.
Hey, give me soda.
Hey, I'm open.
Oof.
- Isn't that kind of like stealing?
- Oh, great.
Now my soda's tainted.
I never associated root beer with a moral dilemma before.
There he is.
Do you think he'll ever ask me out?
Why don't you ask him out?
- That's just a nice way of saying no.
- You can ask him out.
We're modern women.
We know about jet propulsion.
- We do?
- We will.
I can't.
I'll get too nervous.
When I get nervous, my mouth dries out and I can't speak.
Take your soda, and every time your mouth gets dry, just take a sip.
All right, I'll do it.
Hi.
Hi.
So, Justin So, Valerie You wanna go out Saturday night?
Well, at least she broke the ice.
And the sound barrier.
Valerie?
Valerie.
Help me to the emergency exit.
Come on.
You gotta give Justin your answer.
- Don't blow it.
- I already blew it.
Right in his face.
He's a guy.
They study burping as a second language.
Besides, nobody else heard.
You heard, and you were across the room.
I was being a good friend and eavesdropping.
Trust me.
No one heard.
Now, come on.
Don't make me start the speech from Ice Castles.
Everyone, a big welcome for Valerie Burphead.
They're just jealous.
You're so mean.
Come on.
Let's go see Titanic.
We could change the ending.
Oh, Hilda, no one's gonna pay $7 to watch you kiss Leonardo DiCaprio.
Besides, I have a date Friday night, and I'm cleaning my ears.
Last chance to throw yours in.
I just cleaned my ears.
They're fine.
Well, at least no locusts this year.
Help!
I need help!
Salem, caught with your head in the cookie jar?
Hurry.
Please, hurry.
I've been in here for over an hour.
Why didn't you call us sooner?
It wasn't a problem until I ran out of peanut brittle.
Salem, is this a desperate cry for help?
No, this is.
Help!
I'm running out of air!
Zap it off and give me mouth-to-mouth.
Salem, you just want a kiss.
My lips are sweet with brittle.
I guess we should remove it.
Do you want to drive him to the vet, or should I?
Not the vet.
Cold hands, cold table.
And the probing.
Oh, the probing.
Perfect way to teach you a lesson.
I should have suffocated when I had the chance.
I bet they didn't even disinfect the table.
I'm gonna get a disease.
Salem, this is a mortal vet, be quiet.
And start acting like a cat.
You want a cat?
I can do cat.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Werner.
Ungawa.
And this must be Salem Saberhagen.
- You have different last names.
- When we adopted him he didn't want to change his name.
And to hyphen it just seemed ridiculous.
Don't worry.
I'm a crazy cat-lady too.
Oh, I think kitty was playing Pooh Bear.
I love it when they talk baby talk.
Ow-- Uh, meow.
I'll be right back with some lubricant.
I love her.
Hello?
She's a woman, and she's not in love with you.
Please.
All vets love animals.
And once I get her to kiss me, I'll be a man.
Quick, British Sterling behind both ears.
All right, this shouldn't hurt a bit.
There you go.
Oh, there.
Boy, he sure is a nuzzler.
Kiss me, pretty lady.
Turn my world around.
Hey, the soda machine's fixed.
I put in a couple extra quarters to clear my root beer-soaked conscience.
Well, that should cover the 15 sodas you had.
- Have you seen Valerie?
- No.
I haven't seen or heard Burpzilla since the incident.
Someday your body will betray you, Libby, and we'll be waiting.
I'm worried about Valerie.
You think she went home?
Well, she did seem to have some gastric problems.
She really should be here so that we could taunt her to her face.
Libby, why do you get so much pleasure out of other people's pain?
I'm just a positive, upbeat person.
How could Dr. Werner cone me?
Salem, it'll keep you from licking your wound.
You're the one who cut your head on peanut brittle.
I'll never get kissed like this.
I look like a Victrola.
Good idea.
Then we won't have to listen to you complain.
You know, there's this newfangled invention called the hi-fi.
So how was your day?
I'm a little worried about poor Valerie.
I mean, she burped at lunch and I haven't seen her since.
Then I guess you wanna hear about the time I burped in high school.
Not really.
I gotta go call Valerie.
You know what I haven't heard in ages?
Hi, is Valerie there?
I'm over here.
It was a rhetorical question.
Bye.
Valerie?
How'd you get in my house?
It was weird.
Someone slipped a key under the door, but no one was home but your cat.
Oh, yeah, my cat let you in.
Anyway, you're here because?
Because I can't go back to school.
I'm so embarrassed.
I keep replaying the whole ugly thing over and over in my mind.
There are so many unanswered questions.
Why a burp?
Why with Justin?
Why at school?
Why my closet?
Because I feel safe here, Sabrina.
Look, every morning I'll pretend to go to school, hide here all day and relive the incident as I rock back and forth in the dark.
That sounds like a fun solution to your problem.
Stop the music.
Thank you, Sabrina.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to remove a crank from my butt.
I need an anti-embarrassment spell to help Valerie.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
There is no such spell.
The only way to get rid of embarrassment is to just ride it out.
Or put poison in the town's reservoir.
Just a suggestion.
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
It's one of life's lessons, and even witches can't tamper with life's lessons.
I want a world where you can escape your problems and not learn anything.
Like we don't?
Whatever's on the clothesline is scaring me.
Oh, no.
Your ears.
Hilda, I should never have asked you to dry my ears.
You don't hang ears.
You reshape them and dry them flat.
Sorry.
I was never good at laundry.
Come on.
You're young.
They'll shrink back.
In a day or so.
I hope so, because I have a date Friday night, and I can't wear these.
You know, I feel another song coming on.
Do your ears hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?
Can you tie them in a knot?
Can you tie them--?
Oh, wait, this is my fault.
You're a good friend.
Thanks for standing by me.
Of course I'd stand by you.
I've never seen so much laughing, mocking, name-calling.
I think you've had enough.
Look, you can hang out here as long as you want, but I'm gonna get back to work on our jet-propulsion project.
Oh, I completely forgot our project's due tomorrow.
That's okay.
I don't need any sleep.
Look, I can't dump that whole thing on you.
What?
We're gonna do a satellite feed from my room?
No.
I'll just have to face that one class for you.
You'd do that for me?
Well, you're sharing your room with me.
Oh, hey, by the way, can I borrow this weird, jewelled book?
No!
Mine.
Oh, that's right.
You're an only child.
Yes, Dr. Werner.
May I call you Jean?
Okay, so Dr. Werner, I know you don't normally make house calls, but it would really help Salem's recovery if you could come by and smother him with kisses.
Salem, get off the phone.
Valerie's such a great friend.
She's gonna face school just for me.
You got me off the phone with the future Mrs. Saberhagen for that?
Do you think there's any way I could help her get rid of her embarrassment?
Well, there is a spell.
Not according to my aunts.
For one teensy kiss, I'll let you in on the little-known fact that embarrassment is cross-referenced in the magic book under Gerald Ford.
Thanks, Salem.
Wait, I didn't do that right.
"To remove embarrassment, one must laugh at one's self.
Add a pinch of ha-ha root".
We have it, and yet we're always out of vanilla.
A banana peel?
"The embarrassee must slip on this peel in public to remove embarrassment".
"If dissatisfied, exchange for a seltzer bottle"?
I feel like everyone's staring at me.
They're not staring at you, they're staring with you.
Hi, Valerie.
Love your belch.
I mean belt.
Just ignore her.
I have a feeling sometime real soon we're gonna laugh about this.
Not in this life.
Come on, laugh at yourself.
Here, let me give you a hand.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm starting to look at clown colleges, heh-heh.
- You know, Valerie, about Saturday-- - Yes.
When I burp, it means "yes".
When I spit milk out my nose it means "no".
- Great.
So I'll pick you up at 8?
- Mm-hm.
Ugh, great.
I had banana goo on my butt when I was talking to Justin, didn't I?
Yeah.
Oh, who cares?
We better get to Physics.
And they say you can't get rid of embarrassment.
It's a classic.
So by definition, it's the momentum derived from ejection of exhaust stream.
- Sabrina?
- Thank you, Valerie.
"Another form of jet propulsion is the rapid flow of gas from within a propelled body".
Oh, the humanity.
Most people just use visual aids.
I Uh, "so the different examples of propulsion are the rocket, the fanjet--" Yeah, we could use a fan right about now.
Go, go, go!
Hold me.
Boy, is your face red.
Oh, no.
You cast an anti-embarrassment spell on Valerie.
Yeah.
The one you said didn't exist.
Honey, did it ever occur to you just to listen to us?
The cat said You can't get rid of embarrassment.
You can only displace it.
It's left Valerie and been transferred to you since you cast the spell.
Oops.
I blame it on the cone.
Oh, honey, you got a little spinach in your teeth.
That's the least of it.
You don't know the embarrassment I've seen.
Oh, Sabrina, everyone has embarrassing moments.
It's happened throughout history.
Even the most famous people have lived through humiliation, but that's not what they're remembered for.
Let's roll tape.
NARRATOR : Historical Moments Not in History.
Queen Victoria greets her loyal subjects.
On this fateful day, not even Camelot was Camelot.
Guinevere, avert your eyes.
We declared our independence, but not without a fight.
Hancock.
- You had to show off with the K. Better order dinner.
Now we've got some real writing to do.
The master da Vinci suffers for his art.
And that's Historical Moments Not in History.
See?
And they were all remembered for their greatness.
But none of them were in high school.
- Sabrina, I have to talk to you.
- I know why you're here.
To try to talk me into going back to school.
No!
Don't go back.
You can't go back.
The laughter is deafening.
Look, even if you change your identity and became a brunette, they'd find you.
Look, I shouldn't even be here.
Trust no one.
There's nowhere to go.
There's nowhere to hide.
There's gotta be somewhere to hide.
Let's see, I've got a bedroom, a bathroom, a vortex Wait a minute.
Wow, this is great.
I should have gotten embarrassed last summer.
Can I get you something?
Yeah, I'd like one of those pretty drinks with the umbrellas in it, and throw in a cherry, my good man.
The best fruit smoothie in the Other Realm coming right up.
"Dear Valerie.
Hello from the islands.
Wish you were here.
I've told you too much already".
So where are you from?
You look like a girl with a story.
No story.
I'm not escaping from anything.
You been here before?
You look familiar.
Impossible.
Hey, you're Sabrina.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, no, no.
You're Sabrina.
Hey, hey.
Hey, look, everyone, it's Sabrina.
Ha, ha!
And it happened in front of the whole class.
It's a perfectly normal bodily function.
So, been to the Other Realm islands?
How'd you know?
Hilda and I spent puberty there.
I was a redhead.
But how did they know?
Witches are always scouring the globe looking for a good laugh.
Although we just don't get British humour.
I guess I'm just gonna have to face my fate: Home schooling.
Oh, honey, running away never solves anything.
You will get through this.
Yeah.
You just have to look at the big picture.
At any given moment, high school students all across the country are doing something embarrassing.
Yeah, but did all those people?
I can't even say it.
Cheese?
You what?
Whoa, that is the queen mother of embarrassment.
Well, I can teach her music, and, Zelly, you can teach-- Come on, it doesn't matter what happened.
Life goes on, and eventually everything becomes yesterday's news.
In the meantime, try not to worry too much about what other people think.
But if I don't worry about what other people think, what will they say?
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.
Oh, I forgot to call and postpone my date with Frank.
Why?
You're not embarrassed about your ears, are you?
Well, of course not.
I-- I just felt I should be here with you.
Well, I'm fine, and I have Aunt Hilda.
Well, then, okay.
I guess I'll keep my date.
I wouldn't wear earrings.
Somebody?
I'm stuck cone down.
Take me to Dr. Werner's.
Stat.
I'll take you.
I'm the only member of this family who can still go out in public.
I do not like this laceration at the base of his tail.
Unfortunately, I think we need to shave him.
Well, we want what's best for Salem, even if it does mean a bare bottom.
But the beautiful doctor will see my popo.
Yes, I've been working for weeks on molecular cohesion, but it's just not coming together.
Zelda, you're so witty, so intelligent, - and so lovely.
- Oh.
I just wanna whisper sweet nothings in your ear.
So, tell me about your work.
Well, I guess I'm ready to face school.
On second thought Ah, this is a snugly place to wait out adolescence.
Come on, Sabrina, get up.
You're gonna be late, and I want the warm bed.
I'm not going.
I can't possibly be yesterday's news yet.
Come on, you're a witch.
Use your magic to make other people do embarrassing things.
You can be yesterday's news today.
Something's wrong.
This is kind of making sense to me.
You bet it makes sense.
Now how about a thank-you kiss?
They keep saying how everyone has embarrassing moments.
I would just be helping things along, right?
Don't rationalise, mobilise.
You've got to save yourself.
You're right.
It's a jungle out there.
Survival of the fittest.
I'm not going down without a fight.
Okay, you're pumped.
Now go to school.
- Thanks, Salem.
- Hey, I owed you one.
I really appreciate you covering my shaved behind with these nice pants.
I only did it because the sight of your chicken skin was making me sick.
Glad I didn't bother to write a thank-you note.
Look at her.
Well, time to become yesterday's news.
Sabrina, you're here.
Ooh, I hate to say this, but the red face isn't much of a disguise.
Yeah, yeah, I'll work on it.
Okay, where's my first victim?
Aha!
Get ready to become a human dribble-glass.
Nah.
Ooh.
One uncontrollable runny nose coming right up.
Do it.
Kiss, kiss.
Nah.
Let's see you try flirting with bad breath.
I can't.
I'll just ride it out like everyone else.
Hey, Sabrina.
Sorry you got humiliated the other day, but at least I finally got a day off.
I'm glad I could help.
You know, I always used to think you were so perfect, almost like you weren't human, but turns out you're just one of us.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Huh, well, I guess this doesn't have any magic anymore.
This is for the football team.
Out of my way.
Laugh.
Split a gut.
Well, everyone's back to normal.
My face, Salem's behind, Aunt Zelda's ears, Aunt Hilda-- Well, someday.
You're grounded.
Hello.
Salem, I bet it feels good to get rid of that cone, huh?
Oh, you're such a good kitty.
Come here, little guy.
This is it.
I'm gonna be a big guy.
Nothing happened.
That stupid, stupid camel.
Salem, have you lost your mind?
She'll wake up and think she's just overworked and needs a vacation.
Maybe the spell will work if I kiss her.
Guess it's time to change vets again.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Well, I had a wonderful time this evening.
Me too.
He really is the lord of the dance, huh?
He's not gonna kiss her good night, is he?
I hope not.
His depth perception is terrible.
He was always getting his nose in my eye.
Why do you tell me things like that so close to my bedtime?
Really, I'm fine.
You missed the cornea.
And may I ask what you are doing?
Oh, I was just gonna use the drapes to make playsuits for the von Trapp children.
- That's your story?
- Yeah.
I think it holds together.
We'll just see about that.
A lie detector?
I can't believe you'd think I'd lie to you.
Are you open to a bribe?
I'm really an actress.
Do you want fries with that?
And so the assignment that Mrs. Palotti has left for you while she's out sick, has you splitting up into couples so you can experience the "realities," "joys," and "responsibilities of marriage".
Hm.
For some reason there's nothing here about the corresponding pain, torture and humiliation.
Everything is so p.c. these days.
Every day you will receive a different task.
"Make a budget".
Ha, please.
"Set common goals".
Yeah, I'm sure.
"Share your feelings".
Right.
Share my feelings with a woman who spends all day I do.
- Yes, Libby.
- I was just wondering if you need help pairing up the couples, so you're free to focus on your bitterness.
Thank you, Libby.
You are a delightful throwback.
I'm really sorry we weren't paired up together.
I'm kind of surprised I got Libby.
Yeah, big surprise.
Right up there with snow in December.
You don't mind, do you?
No, it's just an assignment.
It's not like you're really married.
Besides, you're always working on your car.
You won't even have time to see her.
I can't work on my car until I can afford that heater valve, remember?
My afternoons are totally free.
Oh, well, it's never too soon to start preparing for your SATs.
You're always looking out for me, Sabrina.
I love it when you do that.
And it's even more fun now that it's so wrong.
In the future when you'd like to speak with my husband, you go through me.
Harvey, darling, wait.
It's just an assignment.
Make-believe.
You're not really married.
Hi, honey, I'm home.
Why won't you tell me what you and Willard talk about?
Because it's none of your business.
He's tattooed my name to his arm, hasn't he?
No, he hasn't.
Oh, so you've seen his arms.
What's the matter with you?
Somebody get their chocolate in your peanut butter?
No.
Libby's trying to steal Harvey.
Oh.
You know, Sabrina, no one can be stolen unless they want to be.
Oh, so now Willard wanted to be stolen.
I trust Harvey.
It's Libby I don't trust.
As the saying goes, it takes two to tango.
Zelda, we're not talking about dancing here.
We've got two people-- Oh.
Please continue.
Oh, you poor, naive little thing.
- So innocent to the ways of love.
- I told you, I trust Harvey.
It doesn't matter what Libby does, Harvey would never cheat on me.
That's what I thought when I was dating Madame Curie.
Marie started spending a lot of time in the lab with Pierre.
They told me it was an experiment, but I knew better.
She kept saying the phrase.
"Stay away from me or I'll call the police"?
No.
"Don't you trust me"?
You knew she was cheating because she said, "Don't you trust me"?
That, and I hired a detective from the Other Realm and got some pictures of them sharing more than radiation.
I'm not hiring a detective to spy on Harvey.
- For the last time, I trust him.
- Uh-huh.
Do you even know where he is?
Yes.
He's at home.
I'll prove it to you.
HARVEY : Hello?
- Hello, Harvey.
I knew you'd be home.
- Oh, hi, Sabrina.
- Hi, Sabrina.
Libby?
What's Libby doing there?
Proving my point.
She came over and brought me some homemade cookies.
I don't remember that being part of the assignment.
Goodbye, Sabrina.
I don't wanna keep you from your ice cream and romance novel.
Do you still have that detective's number?
You've got ice cream?
She blew into my office like a cool breeze on a hot summer day.
Who said that?
But trouble clung to her like a cotton sheet to a wet dog.
Okay, I get it.
Is there anyone here who can help me?
Depends on what kind of help you're looking for, sweetheart.
- Roland?
- Sabrina.
You found me.
What happened to your job as an equalizer?
Oh, they went totally digital.
So let me guess, trouble with farm boy?
- Stepping out on you, huh?
- No.
Maybe.
Hundred bucks a day plus expenses.
Sure, I make that a night, babysitting.
I don't have that kind of money.
This ain't no charity ward, baby.
The fog machine, the voice-over guy, they all cost money.
Forget it.
This was a bad idea.
Oh, wait, I just remembered.
I'm running a special this month.
"An hour of surveillance for one minute of hand-holding".
Thanks.
I'll call you if I ever stop screaming.
Like peanut butter to the roof of yo-- Knock it off.
Hey, Sabrina.
Sorry about yesterday.
That's okay.
Now that Libby's been to your house, I guess the worst is over.
- Wow, Libby, did you do all this?
- Me and Locker World.
There are separate places for your books, for your lunch, and an odour-proof, lead-lined compartment for your gym shoes.
Remember, I gave you a roach motel.
I just wanted to make sure I did a good job on today's assignment.
"Wives, do something nice for your husbands".
For a change.
Not just take, take, take.
Excellent work, Libby.
I'll see you at lunch, Harvey.
I packed us something special.
- You're having lunch with her now?
- Thanks for being so understanding.
You're the best.
Hey.
My kiss.
- Hello, Roland?
- I knew you'd call back.
- Dames are so predictable.
- I've gotta know what's going on between Harvey and Libby.
Can you start right away?
As soon as we settle our fee.
One minute, payable immediately.
One hippopotamus.
Two hippopotamus.
Three hippopotamus.
Oh, Willard, that's hilarious.
Do me a favour, put down the phone.
Oh, ha, ha.
You're too much.
Psst.
I bet you didn't even recognise me, huh?
- What are you supposed to be?
- An exchange student.
Pretend like you don't know me.
Well, that shouldn't be hard.
It's my fantasy.
- Hello, fellow students.
- Aren't you Sabrina's cousin?
Guess again, farm boy.
So you two are dating?
Well?
- Well, what?
Our assignment.
"Wives, prepare a special treat for your husbands, and try not to bring it up resentfully years later during an argument".
Right.
Oh, I got you a fruit cup.
How many times do I have to tell you?
I'm not Sabrina's cousin.
I'm from Iceland.
My name is Bjorn.
Okay, Bjorn, and how many times do I have to tell you?
Libby's not my girlfriend, Sabrina is.
What did you find out?
Forget it.
Move on.
You and Harvey are history.
What?
I can't believe it.
Well, that's just my preliminary report.
If you need more details Great lunch, Libby.
You're the best.
That's my kiss.
- You just kissed Libby.
- Just on the cheek.
Then you admit it?
What's wrong, Sabrina?
Don't you trust me?
What did you say?
Don't you trust me?
Find out everything.
I want pictures, I want video.
Money's no object.
Tomorrow, 8:00.
See you then, Willard.
- I hope you've learned your lesson.
- What lesson?
Is Willard trying to get you to teach me a lesson?
- Is that what he's doing?
- Hilda, you need to find a therapist, one who doesn't refer to you as caller number two.
He better not be taking you to the stockyard, because that was our special place.
I'm not telling you anything.
But I might, provided there's tuna.
Hey, Sabrina, how's it going?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
Oh, so now you're hiding things from me?
- What am I hiding from you?
- How should I know?
How should you know what?
Oh, pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about.
Who's pretending?
- Sorry.
I had to get my camera.
- I'm so glad you're here.
Harvey's acting totally weird.
It ain't pretty, but the truth never is.
I never knew betrayal came wallet-sized.
Goodbye, farm boy.
Hello, Roland.
Harvey Kinkle, you've got a lot of explaining to do.
- About what?
- You know about what.
Sabrina, I hate this game.
It makes my head hurt.
You and Libby.
You were all over her in the cafeteria.
- You were hugging her in the hallway.
- What are you talking about?
- I thought you trusted me.
- But-- - Well, can we talk about this?
- I have to meet Libby.
It's our anniversary tonight.
Oh, if you're really supposed to be her husband shouldn't you forget your anniversary?
What do you mean you don't know where they are?
What kind of mother are you?
Hello?
Mrs. Kinkle?
Hello?
I found out where they're going.
Someplace called "the knoll".
They're going to the knoll?
But that's a big make-out-- Come on.
Quick, blend in.
- Happy anniversary.
- Is that your car?
It will be in 53 payments.
What a funny-looking lamp.
Yeah, uh, fascinating.
Why don't we talk about it on the way to the knoll?
It will break my mother's heart.
Let's go.
I'm leaving.
Oh, is your date tonight?
Oh.
I'd completely forgotten.
Nothing more pathetic than a woman who clings to the past.
Unless it's one who sits around in a bathrobe and fuzzy slippers talking to her cat.
Comfy.
Well, I'm glad to see you've made peace with my dating Willard.
You have fun now.
She's gone, let's tail her.
Change me back.
No amount of tuna is worth this olfactory nightmare.
Ugh.
Thanks for driving, Libby.
I'm still waiting for that heater valve for my car.
Surprise.
- This isn't Bowl-A-Rama.
- I know.
I thought we should go someplace fun for our anniversary.
Me too, that's why we were going bowling.
Harvey, so many rough edges to grind.
Chocolate-covered strawberry?
Wow, so this is the knoll.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Ahem, again.
Hey, do you think that's Libby's mom's car over there?
Don't worry, nobody can see us.
Which reminds me, I'm gonna need documentation.
Do you have a camera on you?
Oh, my, how did you ever find this place?
The quarterback on the football team told me about it during detention.
Here, feast your eyes on this, my lady fair.
Oh, look at all those stars.
You were right.
I can't believe they're here.
Don't make me watch.
I'll have to scratch out my own eyes.
It will be fun.
Come on.
Like a horror film, only gorier.
Look, there is no way that-- Oh, is that real butter?
Sorry the stockyards were closed, but it's-- It's kind of pretty here too, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.
Maybe a little music to set the mood?
Hey!
Little girl Fix your hair, do your makeup  What's with all these stupid trees?
You can't see anyone else.
That's the point.
Sabrina, I think we have a serious problem.
- You see Harvey and Libby?
- Not with them.
With us.
Our marriage is on the rocks.
I just keep giving and giving-- The cops.
My dad's gonna kill me.
Is there a problem, officer?
Listen, punk, I need to see some ID and registration now, or it's the business end of big Ed here.
What are you waiting for?
They're over there.
- I'm trying.
- I'm gonna need you to step out of the car, miss.
What about me?
Face forward.
Both hands on the wheel.
Ah, and Orionis, of course, is your typical M-class star, known for its presence of metallic oxide molecules.
- Notably, those with titanium oxide.
- Yes.
Let's go.
I've never been so bored in my entire life, and I stare off into space Come on.
Let's say five more minutes.
This can't be all they talk about.
- Oh, I know.
- Okay.
Let's try and name all the moons of Jupiter by mass.
- Oh, boy.
- Europa.
So you pop in, take a quick look-see, dump Harvey, cry on my shoulder, and we'll live happily ever after.
Plus, I have some long-term plans.
It's true.
I can't believe they're really here.
Yep.
I wouldn't lie to you.
I can't do it.
I thought I could, but I can't.
So I guess this is gonna take some tough love.
Metis, Ganymede, and don't help me, Callisto.
- Oh, excellent.
- Oh, thank you.
Okay.
Now by carbon content.
Can't stay awake.
Too boring.
Now that we're all alone, is there anything you'd like to say to me?
Yeah, if you get any closer, I'm gonna fall out of the car.
Then you'd better hold on to something.
You point it, I break it.
Libby, cut it out.
I've got a girlfriend.
But the other day at school you kissed me.
I know.
It was weird.
I don't even know why I did it.
I bet I do.
Sabrina's my girlfriend.
I'm not gonna cheat on her.
- I won't tell if you won't.
- "No" means no, Libby.
I think you should take me home now.
But I bought you dinner.
Sabrina, this is the last straw.
I don't care how it affects my final grade, I want a divorce.
- Sabrina?
- Bjorn?
Now you're spying on me?
I can't believe you don't trust me.
Harvey, wait.
- Hilda?
- Hilda?
Oh.
I can't believe you were so jealous that you had to spy on us.
Oh, I have never been so mad at you in my entire life.
Hilda.
- That's not true.
Remember when we were kids and I broke your collarbone?
Oh, Zelda, wait.
Ha, wow.
Sisters fighting over me.
Hey, when you got it,  You got it.
Harvey.
Sabrina.
Oh, Zelda.
None of this would have happened if you had learned to control your primitive urges, if all of you hadn't been overcome with jealousy.
I wasn't jealous.
I was hungry.
I was jealous and I was hungry.
Once again, I'm the only mature responsible one in the entire group.
That must make you all incredibly jealous.
Well, thanks for the lecture, toots, but I gotta run.
So I'll be collecting the rest of my fee-- I'm not paying you any more.
This was all your fault.
Oh, yeah?
Well, who came to whose office?
You were both at fault, but if it'll get rid of you any faster, I will cover the rest of your fee.
There.
Paid in full.
I usually get time and a half after 5.
- It's a union thing.
- Out.
I also do general contracting.
So to sum it up, our marriage was a complete and total failure.
Thank you.
Beautiful.
Come on.
Beautiful.
Oh, the memories.
You know, it is so great to see a young couple on the right track.
A. Gordie, I just want to apologise.
You were a great husband, and I'm sorry that I treated you so badly.
Are you kidding?
You're a genius.
We're the only two who passed.
Thanks.
No running.
Hey, can you believe we got an A?
I know you're mad at me, but can't you be the kind of mad - where you still talk to me?
- I'm not mad.
I'm disappointed.
The kind of disappointed where you still talk to me?
You know, my behaviour kind of shows how much I care about you in some weird, twisted, demented, stalker kind of way.
I know you care.
I just want you to trust me, and believe me when I say you're the only girl for me.
I do.
Now.
Not that I didn't before, because I did, sort of, but not in the same way I do now.
Let me know if I make a point.
- What's this?
- You don't know?
The guy at the junkyard said it was a heater valve.
- I knew he was gonna rip me off.
- This is so great.
- This is just the kind of thing that-- - Libby would do.
No.
This is just the kind of thing that only Sabrina would do.
I love it when you do that.
It was really nice of Gordie to let us use his car.
He had no choice, it was part of our divorce agreement.
He got the house.
Libby and I are only talking through our lawyers.
You know, at first I thought this assignment was kind of stupid, but then it made me realise how hard relationships can be.
I know.
But I'm sure it gets easier as you get older.
I hope they don't take the freeway.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Calling all blonds.
Calling all blonds.
We read you, obnoxious cat.
- Notice anything different?
- You threw up on the sofa?
I said "different".
It's the clock on the VCR.
I programmed it.
It's not blinking 12 anymore.
Isn't that great?
Yeah, that's what I'd call it if I were being sarcastic.
I didn't know we had a clock on the VCR.
We could have fixed it ourselves if we wanted to.
We're witches.
You dames are just bitter because I'm the man of the house, and I know how to do the manly stuff.
Well, you certainly have the scratching-yourself part down.
If you really want to impress us, programme this.
I didn't know we had a clock on our scoreboard.
We cooked up a great show for you tonight.
You know, fixing that VCR got my testosterone pumping.
Mr. Can-Opener, meet your worst nightmare: Mr. Screwdriver.
I'll get it.
You know, in most homes, the mail comes in little white envelopes.
It's from your cousin Mortimer.
He's coming to help you discover the family secret.
Sabrina, I should warn you.
Your cousin Mortimer is a wigician.
A wigician?
- A witch who works as a magician.
- How cool.
I mean, how unspeakably tragic.
He was so gifted.
He could have done so much.
Instead he chose to squander his talents entertaining gullible mortals.
And the worst part is, he's not even good at it.
Ta-da.
That's magician for "I'm here".
Oh, no, please, you're too kind, ha, ha, ha.
- This must be Sabrina.
- Okay, enough small talk.
Discuss the family secret and let him be on his way.
He's a very busy man, and this is cruise season, after all.
No, there's no rush.
I've got a gig tomorrow night at the Westbridge Y and you're all comped, if you don't mind eating family style.
- Well-- - Before you say anything, I'm wanna show you my new closer.
Nothing up here, nothing up here, nothing up here, but what have we here?
Aha, and, oh, look at this.
I knew it was coming and yet I'm still delighted.
Ha, ha, and a pickle.
A nickel.
It's supposed to be a nickel.
Oh, that's wrong.
I-- It's a new trick.
Hey, you guys wanna go to the Slicery after school today?
We're only 200 pizzas away from a free soda.
I can't.
My dad's out of town and I have to watch my little brother.
- What about your mom?
Is she sick?
- Very.
She'spregnant.
Pregnant?
Congratulations, I guess.
- You mean your parents still--?
- Valerie, we're trying to eat here.
- I just thought at their advanced age-- - Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know.
I can't get the image out of my mind.
All right, Westbridge.
Westbridge, Westbridge, you're the tops.
Wring Eastbridge dry like grungy old mops.
Tops, mops?
Someone's been reading MoliÃ¨re again.
I have an announcement.
There are a few spots open on the second-string cheerleading squad.
I know.
We haven't had an opening in years.
Not since the time Charlene Snyder developed that puzzling skin condition.
One zit and krrk.
So if you think you're better than everyone, sign up for tryouts.
Hey, Libby, you looked great out there.
Take your seat.
You know, I think I wanna try out for cheerleading.
Oh, no.
You ate your beef stroganoff too fast and now your brain stopped functioning.
We better say this while you can still comprehend it: We all love you.
What is wrong with wanting to be a cheerleader?
Oh, no, we've lost her.
It's eerie.
It looks like she's still with us.
Hm, uh-huh.
I can dismantle this.
All I have to do is spin my head around about 33 times.
Or smash it on the floor.
I can't see what you're doing.
Oh, thanks so much for helping me rehearse.
This is not supposed to hurt at all.
If you feel anything, please speak up.
- Oh.
- I felt that.
Oh, I buy these in bulk.
I'm gonna get another blade.
Listen, in the meantime, would you be good enough to just sign this release?
It doesn't say anything about dismemberment, mutilation, internal-- Stop it.
Oh, I'm glad you guys are home.
I'm really worried about Valerie.
She's fallen in with a bad crowd.
- Trekkies?
- No, worse.
She's trying to become a cheerleader.
What's wrong with that?
At least you get to stand up.
It's a known fact that cheerleaders sleep upside down from rafters of old barns.
Oh, honey, if Valerie wants to be a cheerleader, you have to let her.
What's the harm if it makes her happy?
I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response.
Let me guess.
This is not a good time to ask you about the family secret?
This is a critical time.
I have to concentrate on what I'm doing.
Don't you understand?
Pbbt.
What was I doing?
Na-ha-ha.
Got it.
Wow!
It worked.
It never did that before.
My legs.
Oh, I better go get them.
I think I left the back door open.
Usually it's the audience that walks out.
- Hello?
- Anyway, back to Valerie.
No!
What are you doing?
Friends don't let friends become cheerleaders.
Look, I've thought about what you said, but I still wanna be a cheerleader.
I've always wanted to be a cheerleader.
- It just seems like fun.
- But why, Valerie?
I mean, you're so smart.
You could do so much more.
You could be on the Chess Club or the Astronomy Club or the debate team.
Maybe I just wanna be a cheerleader.
Look, you're gonna have to accept it, okay?
I'm going to try out.
No president has ever been a cheerleader.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- You okay?
This pregnancy is really taking its toll on me.
I was driving around half the night looking for the right breast cream for my mom.
Okay, the less we talk about that subject the better.
You know, this whole cheerleading thing is really making me feel like I don't know Valerie anymore.
I don't see what the harm is if it makes her happy.
Everybody wants Valerie to be happy.
Am I the only one who cares about her?
Oh.
So that's why there's been a busy signal the last hour.
- I've been trying to call my aunts.
- When I'm done, you'll be able to call anyone, any time you want.
You mean like we already do?
Yes, but my way shocks you when you hit the seven.
Oh, what perfect timing.
Now you can ask me anything you want about the family secrets.
No question too big, no question too small.
Ask me anything you want.
I know everything there is to know about this family.
Well, I'd really like to talk about Valerie.
Never heard of her.
Well, she's my best friend and she wants to be a cheerleader, and somehow I've gotta convince her that she's making a mistake.
Ah, then here's what you need.
This will help.
A penny?
I don't think Valerie's into bribes.
No, that's not just a penny.
With this penny you can look right into her mind.
You can tell what she's thinking.
I already know what she's thinking and it all rhymes.
With this, you can manipulate her thoughts, ha, ha.
- Where'd you get such a cool trick?
- That was given to me by the great Harry Houdini.
All I had to do was promise never to talk to him again.
Val, hi.
I'm really sorry about yesterday.
I shouldn't have tried to influence you.
I understand.
You only did it because you care about me.
Exactly.
So here.
Sabrina, you can't buy my friendship.
Especially for a penny.
No.
I learned a magic trick.
Look.
- See?
Disappeared.
- And you put down cheerleading?
Good luck.
Valerie, this is for your own good.
So this is what Valerie thinks it'll be like to be a cheerleader?
I'll show her.
Now, this is more like it.
Green and white.
Hey, beat that team.
What is this, a United Way commercial?
Give me a break.
Green and white.
Making fun of Grandma is more like the cheerleaders I know.
GIRLS : Westbridge, Westbridge, you're the tops.
Wring Eastbridge dry like Come to the big rally.
Bring your family.
Oh, please.
I'm gonna make this last one a doozy.
What are you looking at, freak?
GIRLS : Wring Eastbridge dry like grungy old mops.
Next up in our long-shot category, Valerie Birkhead.
Uh, I changed my mind.
I'm not gonna try out anymore.
Wonder if they give a Nobel Prize for friendship.
- Oh, morning, Cousin Mortimer.
- Yeah, Mortimer, that's right.
It's my agent.
I just wanted to tell you the penny worked.
- Great.
- I probably saved Valerie from a life of crime, which, as everyone knows, is what cheerleading always leads to.
I'm so happy.
What?
Are you sure?
Nothing?
Not even a grand opening for a gas station?
Fine.
- Anything wrong?
- No.
No, no, no.
They just cancelled my gig at the Y. They replaced me with K.I.T.T.
, the talking car from Knight Rider.
Sorry.
I wish there was something I could do.
Oh, I know you-- You wanna help.
If you would, you could.
But listen, I love being a wigician.
I just love it.
The wand, the applause, the different-coloured scarves, the secondhand smoke, I love it.
Well, when you put it that way, who can blame you?
Salem.
He's in the freezer, right next to the Eskimo Pies.
Avert your gaze.
I'm working with isotopes.
Salem, when are you planning to put all this stuff back together?
Relax.
I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
For instance, I just discovered that it's really cold inside the freezer.
My eyes are frozen open.
- Cousin Zelda, let me help you.
- No, Mortimer-- I insist, please.
Step back.
Abracadabra, abracadunk.
Please, someone help us with all this junk.
Ah.
Hilda?
Zelda?
Hello?
Do I smell curry?
I can't believe you made him disappear.
It has to do with the-- Oh, see?
Look.
Trust me, Val.
Orchestra Club is the way to go.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe that's where my kind belongs.
In the darkest corner of the orchestra pit playing the triangle.
That's the spirit.
Now that you won't have cheerleading practise every afternoon, we can do whatever we want.
Go to the mall and try on clothes we can't afford.
Take naps.
I'm even willing to go to that place where you paint the plates and cups.
Come on, what do you say?
My mom could use a new spoon caddy.
This is gonna be great.
You and me doing everything together just like things used to be.
Do you guys have any idea where I can rent a Mother Goose karaoke machine?
Harvey Kinkle, king of the conversation starters.
My little brother's birthday party is today.
I'm in charge of the entertainment.
- What did you get?
Nothing.
I've been so busy helping my mom, I completely forgot.
My dad is really gonna lay into me.
I'm telling you, it'll be like the final scene from Braveheart.
Hey, I've got the perfect idea.
Oh, maybe it's not such a good idea.
Please.
Anything.
My cousin Mortimer is a wigici-- Magician.
And he'd be perfect for your brother's party.
Do you think there's any way we could get him?
I'm going out on a limb here, but, um, yes.
Saba-- Oh.
Oh, try again.
And this time, try bringing Salem back.
Okay.
Prim flim blitz.
Hey, that's how I met my first wife.
Would you mind taking a seat with the others, please?
Have I accidentally stumbled into a Boston Market?
Hey.
Great news, Cousin Mortimer, I got you a gig.
A magic show for Harvey's little brother and his friends.
All right, after 300 years of practising for this it's finally paying off.
Yes.
Sabrina, Mortimer doesn't have time to do any magic shows.
He's too busy trying to bring back Salem.
- Oh.
- Oh, but we're getting closer.
He just brought back a guy waiting for his CAT scan.
And a Catskills comedian.
- Everybody comfortable?
- I make a nice living.
And Sylvia and Irving Katz from New Rochelle.
But no Salem.
Then how do you explain Martha Washington?
I don't know.
Besides, I don't think you really want him around children.
It's too late.
The kids are gonna be here--  Now.
I'm going to put this delicious piece of cake-- Mmm.
--and put it in my hat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Here it goes.
Say the magic words, children.
The magic words.
Abracadabra, se-- Ooh.
Oh, look.
Flowers.
And it was a birthday cake.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're too kind.
Please give me a hand for my assistant, Martha.
Who are you people?
And where's George?
Oh, Sabrina, I wish you hadn't asked Cousin Mortimer to do this.
You just know something horrible's gonna happen.
When are you two gonna cut Cousin Mortimer some slack?
He's just doing what he loves.
- Not really well, but he's still doing it.
- He could have been so much more.
He could have been a novelist or a chemist or a professor.
Maybe he doesn't wanna be any of those.
Maybe he just wants to be a wigician.
I mean, what's the harm in it as long as it makes him happy?
Just like Valerie.
Gotta go.
Thank you.
You're so kind.
And now, I need a volunteer.
A volunteer, a volunteer.
How about you?
The birthday boy.
Does he look old enough to have dental records?
Abracadabra, abracadiff.
It's time for the birthday boy to get a gift.
Kids, this man is a menace to society.
And household pets.
You can expect to hear from my lawyer.
Cat, talk.
My career go bye-bye.
Okay.
Up until now, every trick kind of stunk, but that was great.
Yeah.
Did you like that?
A cat talking, my greatest illusion.
Listen, could you vamp till I try to find the kid?
So who here's from out of town?
Abracadiggy, abracadack.
Oh, please, little boy, won't you come back?
What?
Oh!
Once again, the great Mortimer has astounded even himself.
Listen, kid, you don't have to mention this to your parents, okay?
Here.
Go.
Val, I really blew it on this cheerleader thing.
If there's something that makes you happy, then you should go for it.
It doesn't matter what I think.
And you're not just saying that because tryouts were yesterday?
Well, it's never too late.
All you have to do is ask Libby.
You want me to extend the cheerleading tryouts for her?
That is too sad.
Even for you.
Oh, yeah.
That went well.
Would right now be convenient for you?
Um, sure.
Sabrina, I'm no cheerleader.
I can't go through with this.
Oh, what's there to be scared of?
I mean, sure, there is the possibility of humiliation, but this is high school.
When isn't there the possibility of humiliation?
Oh, all right, all right, I'll do it, but on one condition.
Thanks for doing this with me, Sabrina.
It's giving me the confidence I need.
Well, the phrase "you owe me one" comes to mind, yet it seems so inadequate.
Here we have Sabrina Spellman and Valerie Birkhead.
Get ready for some comedy.
Go Westbridge.
- Ready, set, hit it.
- Ready, set, hit it.
VALERIE : Cut the V. Dot the I. Curl the C. T-O-R-Y.
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y.
Victory, victory, that's our cry.
- Was I okay?
- Oh, yeah.
You were incredible.
Like, uh, Martha Graham, if she did sporting events.
Okay.
Now it's time for the essay portion of your audition.
"The effect of cheerleading on the North American Free Trade Agreement"?
"Midis or minis: How long and why"?
No talking.
I wish you didn't have to leave.
I never got to ask you about the family secret.
You mean I'm two inches shorter for nothing?
Actually, I have hidden a clue about the family secret somewhere in the house.
Could you light me?
I'm late.
Well, if I ever get the quarter out of my ear, I'll send it to you.
I'm gonna miss you, ha, ha.
See you.
On second thought, maybe I'll take the closet.
It's weird.
I can't get the curry smell out of my brother, and he can't sleep without sandalwood burning.
Oh, I went through that phase.
Oh, here come the cheerleaders to announce the new squad.
- I'm so nervous.
- Come on, Valerie.
Cut the V, dot the I, curl the C. Now you get the hang of it?
I have the results of our tryouts.
The new members of the second-string cheerleading squad are: Renee Phillips, Danita Jones, and Valerie Birkhead.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
This is weird.
I still like you.
Use them with honour.
Second-string cheerleader.
That means if a varsity cheerleader dies or gains weight, I'm in.
Do you think some day I'll look back on this moment and say it was the happiest of my life?
If the rest of your life stinks, yes.
Let's just hope this is the start of something big.
And as for Sabrina Spellman, who also tried out, we'll be showing a videotape of her audition in the gymnasium after--  Am I to understand I wasn't good?
If you happen to find any shrimp toast in the couch, I wouldn't say no.
Hey, I think I found Mortimer's clue.
Okay, now I'm starting to think he's weird.
Sabrina, you're gonna be getting a lot of clues like this.
Once you've gathered them all, they'll spell out the family secret, but it's up to you to figure it out.
Okay, well, it looks like a superhero with "ABC" written on him.
Is he Alphabet Man?
No, no, no.
He's Spell Man.
That means the family secret's about us?
Jeez, I hope all the other clues are this juicy.
I can't find Mortimer's clue anywhere.
You know, maybe it would help if we think like him.
- Aunt Hilda, I-- - Abracadoobie, abracadoo.
Help us uncover Sabrina's clue.
Anybody hungry?
I know a decent restaurant around the corner.
The Deli Lama.
Wow.
This place is tidier than the appliance section of a department store.
You're not gonna make me buy the extended warranty, are you?
I had a spiritual awakening in Calcutta, not to be a holy man, but to be a handyman.
So you finally have something to do while you're awake.
What's this?
- My mantra.
You can't see it.
A receipt for $3,000 worth of appliance repair?
I'm the man of the house.
This is how men fix things.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I love going to the movies in the Other Realm.
You see next year's blockbusters before they're even made.
Mm, those poor mortal actors.
They actually think they have free will.
Ow.
What is going on?
This is what it feels like to be a mime.
That's odd.
The closet's never refused entry to anyone before.
Well, we'll have to figure it out after the movie.
What?
You're just gonna leave me here?
Sorry, Aunt Hilda.
We're late.
We won't have to sit through the movie listening to you say, "Now, which one is he"?
But--  This is so unfair.
So looks like it's just you and me.
Wanna do each other's hair?
Take that as a "no".
I think my dinosaur is double-parked.
Oh, Salem, you must be up early for your paper route.
Can I zap you something to eat?
Good idea.
You know, I've always felt breakfast is the most important meal of the morning.
Know what we never have in this house?
- Possum.
- No.
Pancakes.
Pancakes for breakfast?
You're mad!
Pancakes?
No!
You know, the whole fork-up-to-my-mouth thing implied I was gonna eat those.
No pancakes.
Not in this house.
Not ever.
What are we, fanatic waffle people?
You mustn't ever eat pancakes.
No one in our family can eat them.
- It's a family secret.
- The family secret?
Just a family secret.
But not being able to eat pancakes is one of the darker and more frightening secrets.
Wow, makes the whole Prince of Tides secret seem tame.
All Spellmans have a terrible weakness for pancakes.
One bite and you won't be able to stop.
Mmm.
I can quit anytime I want.
Salem is not affected because he's not family, but we're deadly serious about you, Sabrina.
Oh, no.
Are we about to have the parent-child pancake talk?
We should have told you this a long time ago.
One bite of pancakes and you'll be hooked for life.
It's almost as shameful as being hooked on phonics.
Well, maybe it won't affect me because I'm half-mortal.
We can't take that risk.
Because our feelings For Sabrina really matter Here's a spell to prevent The aforementioned Sabrina From conjuring pancake batter Well, what am I supposed to do for breakfast?
Try a poached egg.
Yuck.
This is ridiculous.
Whoever heard of being addicted to pancakes?
Haven't you learned by now to believe what your aunts tell you, no matter how silly it sounds?
It's always for your own good.
But they look so syrupy good.
One teensy bite can't possibly hurt.
Sabrina, no.
S-- Sabrina.
There.
I ate pancakes, and I don't feel one bit addicted.
I knew my aunts were overreacting.
Just to save her from herself, I better destroy the rest of these.
Hey, what you eating?
- Pancakes.
Really?
Can I have some?
Normally I would, but this may be the only hot breakfast I get this week.
My mom's not really into cooking much since she got pregnant.
She pretty much spends her whole morning barfing - and yelling at my dad.
- Come on.
Just one little bite.
Since when did you become such a pancake fiend?
Ha, I'm not a fiend.
Ew.
They say she keeps all her belongings in a shopping cart.
My aunts did this to me.
They put weird thoughts in my head.
I am not getting hooked on pancakes.
Hey!
What's in that?
French toast.
Move along.
I can't find anything wrong with the linen closet except that musty, grandmothery smell.
But that came with the house.
Then why am I the only one it refuses to transport to the Other Realm?
You don't still have that plate in your head, do you?
You think it's that plate in my head?
Have you done or said anything lately that might have angered the Witches' Council?
Of course not.
I've been an absolute peach.
Or perhaps I've done something.
- Andrews.
Witch Immigration.
- Immigration?
Well, you've obviously made a gigantic mistake.
My sister and I have lived here for over 200 years.
Someone in this house has been living in the mortal realm illegally without filling out the proper paperwork.
Paperwork?
Offer him a bribe.
We're gonna have to run a F.I.T. That's a field immigration test.
- Read this sentence aloud, please.
- Fine.
"We went out and about again and again in our Ford Falcon".
You're next.
I've got nothing to hide.
"We went oot and aboot agayn and agayn in our Fared Felcon".
- Arrest her.
- What?
Those results were completely inconclusive, eh?
Hilda, you never filled out your paperwork to live in this realm?
It was 200 years ago.
I was busy chopping wood and trying to keep Ben Franklin's hands off me.
Where are you taking her?
Back to the northern sector of the Other Realm, where she came from.
Hilda?
I'll FedEx you your cap with the earflaps.
Stop trying to lick my hands.
There's no syrup on them.
Okay.
Today I'd like to spend some time making a list of possible ways to raise money for this year's prom.
Anyone?
Anyone at all?
Last year I wrote, produced and modelled in a fabulous fashion show.
Didn't that lose $600?
So?
I got to keep my wardrobe.
We could raffle off a Cadillac.
Do you know someone who has one?
No.
I'm just an idea man.
I'm in the mood for pancakes.
Are you holding?
Sabrina, you usually have good ideas.
What sort of a fundraiser would you suggest?
Pancakes!
Are you suggesting we have a pancake breakfast to raise money?
No, no.
I wouldn't want to have breakfast with those soft, flaky, fluffy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth Do you have any?
I think it's a charming idea.
A pancake breakfast it is.
Sabrina, you're drooling.
- Hilda?
- Zelda, can you hear me?
You've gotta get me oot of here.
Are you all right?
Is it just awful?
Well, somebody just traded me for some badger pelts.
So in answer to your question, yes, it is awful.
Do you mind?
I'm trying to have a conversation here.
All right.
Where were we?
Oh, yeah.
Help!
Don't worry, Hilda.
I'll think of something.
Okay, Frenchy, that's it.
You're oot of here.
Gotta be something in this house that tastes like pancakes.
Oh!
Maple-cured ham.
Blechh.
Stupid thing just tastes like ham.
- Hello, Sabrina.
- Oh, home from school.
Felt like a snack.
Maybe fruit.
I've got to fill out forms or Aunt Hilda will be trapped in the Other Realm forever, which I know has its upside, but she's my sister after all.
Honey, are you all right?
Your hand is shaking.
I don't think so.
Maybe your eyes are shaking.
Okay.
I know I can just sit here, watch TV and not think about pancakes.
MAN 1 : Mannix, you've broken every rule in the book.
You can't eat pancakes during a high-speed chase.
MAN 2: Rommel's dilemma came down to one agonising choice: Hitler or pancakes.
Hello.
You're on Loveline.
MAN 3: I like pancakes.
Jeez, I'm the only cat I know who has insomnia.
Maybe it's that 22-hour nap I took today.
Is that a light I see in the kitchen?
Sabrina!
Ahh!
No, no.
You're making pancakes, aren't you?
You're hooked.
You're a flapjack fiend.
No, I'm not!
I-- I'm not.
Yes, I am.
I'm hooked.
And you know what?
There's a big pancake breakfast tomorrow at school and everyone's gonna know my shameful secret.
- You've gotta help me.
- I'll help you through this.
There's no problem you and I can't solve together.
Except maybe world hunger.
And war and global warming and Maybe we can't solve this problem.
Okay, we can brew up a syrup that'll make you hate the taste of pancakes.
You can take it with you to school and pour it on before you take that first bite.
- It'll taste so bad-- Eh.
- Quit flapping your lip, cat, and give me the first ingredient.
You're pressing on my Adam's apple.
Oyster juice.
Great.
Now, this time, in the beaker.
Oh, Sabrina, you brought your own syrup.
Yeah.
I'm germ-phobic.
Me too.
I brought gloves.
Hey, I saved you a seat, and I got you an extra-big stack.
I'm just gonna have a bite.
Yesterday they were all you could talk about.
Oh, so a woman should be seen and not heard, is that it?
Are you okay?
Is that twitch new?
Hey, Sabrina, this one fell on the floor.
I thought you might like it.
Okay.
What's the catch?
Ew, squared.
Okay, I'm just gonna put my syrup on these and then My syrup.
Where's my syrup?
No!
Wait!
I gotta get out of here.
Oh, these taste awful.
My syrup.
Just one bite.
Hey, these aren't awful.
They're delicious.
They're blueberry.
I don't like blueberry.
Oh, no.
More!
I need more!
What are you all sitting there for?
I need pancakes!
I need more pancakes!
I hope nobody noticed that.
Finally, I have filled out the last of Hilda's immigration papers.
"Emergency.
Please rush".
Now to get them to the Other Realm.
Why do you still use the pony express?
I got a coupon 150 years ago.
He could have at least cleaned up after his horse.
There are wood shavings everywhere.
That was fast.
I was worried he wouldn't make it through Comanche country.
"Thank you for filing your request for a change in immigration status.
Please expect a response within five to ten working years".
- Years?
- Ooh, that's too bad.
I am really gonna miss, uh Helga?
I can't wait years to get Hilda out of that frozen purgatory.
If I want my sister back, I'm gonna have to take matters into my own hands.
You're gonna form your own ragtag band of commandos?
Aunt Zelda, help!
Sabrina?
I think I'm retaining water.
Or syrup.
Oh, dear.
I think I know what's happened here.
Let's get you inside.
- Suck it in.
I am!
How many pancakes did you eat?
I don't know.
I lost count after the first 500.
You know, there's a bright future for this girl in professional wrestling.
Salem, that was totally uncalled for.
Sabrina, you're crushing my foot.
You should have listened to your aunts.
But I realise that young people sometimes think they know more than their elders.
Kids.
The first thing to do is to get you back to normal size.
Ah, thank you, Dr. Brickman.
I'm cured.
- Sabrina!
- It's a crepe!
You have to go cold turkey.
I know it's hard.
When I gave up red meat, I was ready to kill.
But I had to.
The old ticker.
Fine.
I'll-- I'll start my recovery right now.
I hear there's a 12-step meeting at Howard Johnson's.
Oh, how long do I have to stay in here?
It may take a few hours.
It may take a few days.
But there's no other way to beat this thing.
Couldn't this be one of those things we just accept?
Honey, I'll be back as soon as I can.
I've got to go to the Other Realm to rescue Hilda.
But Salem, if there's an emergency, you know where to call, right?
The Money Store?
Yes, I have your pager number.
Oh, don't worry.
I went through the same pancake detox years ago.
You'll get through it.
Just remember, it's times like these that build character.
I don't want character.
I want pancakes!
Keep busy.
That'll make the time go by.
I got 18 kids.
Sure could use a mama.
- Hilda.
- Oh, Zelda!
Please tell me you have my citizenship papers.
At midnight, it's Crazy Klondike Bride Daze.
No.
I'm gonna sneak you across the border.
- It's our only hope.
- Are you sure?
It's so dangerous.
We could get lost in the storm and freeze to death.
We could be eaten by bears.
Not if youse my wife, you won't.
Okay, come on, Zelda, mush!
No.
Blueberry.
Flapjacks, griddlecakes Flannel cakes, hoecakes We don't care Just give us mo' cakes Cook 'em up, stack 'em up Ten miles high Pour on the syrup And my, oh, my Cakes on the griddle Fill up your middle The answer to the riddle Is cakes on the griddle That's right The answer to the riddle Is cakes on the griddle That's right The answer to the riddle Is cakes on the griddle That's right The answer to the riddle Is cakes on the griddle  That's right The answer to the riddle Salem, you gotta get me out of here.
Hey, Sabrina, hungry?
- Who are you?
- Why, I'm Mrs. Mapleton.
I'm the syrup dispenser of your dreams.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
I'm here to help you, dear.
- Can you get me out of this room?
- Of course.
We'll go someplace where you'll feel safe and happy.
Take hold of my handle.
Ooh!
Sorry if it's a little sticky.
How can I be sure I can trust you?
After all, you're a giant syrup dispenser.
So I guess that means I'm not a good person?
Come on.
Where are we?
We're at the International Pancake House.
Now that I'm trying to kick pancakes, good place to take me.
Everyone's here because they love pancakes just like you do.
But I don't wanna be hooked on pancakes.
I forgot about my friends.
I forgot about my family.
All I could think about was getting more pancakes, eating more pancakes.
The butter, the syrup-- Maybe I'll just have one little stack.
There's nothing wrong with liking pancakes.
Why should you have to suffer and spend your whole life craving something you can't have?
If I stay here, I'll never see my aunts or my friends again.
Friends hurt you.
Friends cancel plans.
Pancakes don't.
And they smell delicious.
Why not take just one little bite?
Well, since the fork is here Oh, there it is: the border to the mortal realm.
- Oh, we've made it.
Freeze.
Oh, like we could do anything else in this weather.
- Where do you think you're going?
- To the mortal realm.
To our home.
So we'll be on our way and you can get back to chasing Snidely Whiplash, okay?
Before I let you go, I have to ask questions about the mortal realm to prove you live there.
Standard procedure.
Fire away.
I do have three Ph.
Ds.
What are the names of the Hanson brothers?
Who?
Isaac, Zachary and Taylor.
What actor from Marcus Welby just married Barbra Streisand?
- Ooh, ooh.
Robert Young.
- James Brolin.
- Sports.
Who's the best--?
- Michael Jordan.
- Correct.
You can go.
- Yes!
- Oh, not you.
Her.
- But-- But-- You didn't answer one question.
There's no way you live in the mortal realm.
But I do.
I-- I know who wrote Pride and Prejudice.
I-- I know who-- Who discovered the uranium isotope.
Nobody in the mortal realm knows those.
- Hilda!
- I'll help you, Zelda.
Go back to the bar and wait for me.
You'll be okay.
Tonight's ladies' night, and you'll be the only lady.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat.
Eat, eat, eat  Sabrina?
Sabrina?
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Sabrina.
It's okay.
It's Aunt Hilda.
- Is it over?
- There's only one way to be sure.
- No.
- Oh, very good.
- So how do you feel?
- Like I want pancakes.
But I guess that's how I'm always gonna feel.
I'll just have to take it one day at a time.
I'm so proud of you.
I should start getting my life back together.
- I'm off to the mall.
- Not so fast.
If Aunt Zelda were here she'd give you some kind of parental lecture, but because she's still waiting for me to save her, I'll have to fill in.
Um, Sabrina, you-- Should listen to you guys and trust your advice.
Right.
And-- Realise that it's easier to solve problems when I ask for help.
Exactly.
And always-- Know that my family is there for me.
Right.
Man, I am good.
Sabrina!
Hilda!
Come quick!
I guess it's time to put chains on this hamper.
Aunt Zelda, you escaped.
How did you get oot?
I mean, out?
I was sitting there, waiting for you, in that awful saloon when MAN : Down the right wing, he's got a man open, crosses the blue line.
He's looking for a shot.
Oh, I don't know how many of you are familiar with Swan Lake, but--  And the next thing I know, I was being tossed across the border.
- But Sabrina, how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Aunt Hilda helped me through it.
Oh, well, I'm glad Hilda helped someone.
I'm just glad not to be hallucinating anymore.
Oh, hi, Mrs. M. Who is she talking to?
I was-- She was--  Hard day.
Lots of sugar.
You know what, Charlie?
You're my only friend.
You're my only friend in the whole wide world.
Salem, how many catnip mai tais have you had?
- What's it to you?
- Salem, this has gone too far.
Your litter box is a mess.
You can't keep your cat food down.
You owe money to pet stores all over town.
You have to admit you've become powerless over catnip.
That your life has become unmanageable.
You know what, Sabrina?
You're my only friend in this whole wide world.
Let's get you home before you start singing show tunes.
My mother was a saint.
I could take anyone in this place.
Come on!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Good evening.
It's that time of year again, children.
Halloween.
I'll work on that.
Tonight's terrifying episode of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch may not be suitable for some parents.
Meh-heh-heh.
This would be a good time to put them to bed.
I'll wait.
Oh, that was quick.
So you're all alone without Mommy or Daddy?
Well, there's been a jailbreak.
An escaped convict in your neighbourhood.
Ooh!
Who's that behind you?
Made you look.
I'm one hot tamale.
Hilda.
Hilda, get ahold of yourself.
Ah.
Thanks.
I needed that.
Oh, no.
We've been invited to Aunt Beulah's Halloween party again.
Aunt Beulah?
I've never met her.
Does she know the family secret?
Her only secret is that she's managed to throw the dullest Halloween party for the last 500 years in a row.
So why do you guys go?
It's not like your social life-- Oh.
We've never gone.
Come to think of it, we've never even met her.
And we're running out of excuses.
World Wars I and II, the Chicago fires not to mention Luke and Laura's wedding.
Oh, dear, we have to go.
Oh, thank goodness.
I was afraid I was gonna have fun this Halloween.
There.
We've R.S.V.P.
'd.
Which stands for rotten, stupid, vile party.
Well, it's not like it's etched in stone.
"Spellman family confirmed for Allhallows Eve".
Is it possible to put someone up for adoption just for one night?
Yeah, put me up.
I've got the best idea for Halloween: Harvey, Justin, you and me at your house watching scary movies.
Please tell me you haven't already invited them.
No, I learned my lesson last year.
I'm telling you before I invite people to your house without telling you.
Good.
I'd like to have you guys over, but I've already promised my aunts-- - Harvey.
- And Justin.
- Sabrina.
- And Valerie.
- Let's not break into song.
- What are we doing for Halloween?
Watching scary movies at Sabrina's house.
Cool.
We'll get the movies, you get the hoagies.
Valerie, you invited people to my house again.
Sorry.
It's so ironic.
It's the one area of my life I'm really pushy.
Please, please, please don't make me go to Aunt Beulah's party.
Come on.
It's our first double date.
Come on.
If you say yes, I'll do all the cooking, the cleaning, the laundry.
You won't have to lift your finger for weeks.
Come on, look at this face.
Oh, all right.
You don't have to go.
Thanks.
Are you still gonna hold me to that cooking-cleaning-laundry thing?
Boo!
Salem, you look ridiculous.
You were terrified, and you know it.
Special delivery for Sabrina Spellman.
Oh, that's me.
Um, would you accept an invisible tip?
How about if you kiss my invisible behind?
Sounds like someone should go back to sorting.
Why does Sabrina get to stay home and I have to go?
Aunt Beulah sent me a Halloween present because I can't make it to her party.
She doesn't have to go and she gets presents?
It's a Molly Dolly.
Whatever happened to a crisp 20?
Oh, well, dear, she means well.
Listen, if you need to call us, we left the number.
This will be fun.
I haven't been a chaperone since Altamont.
I don't have to go.
I just remembered I have free will.
No, you don't.
Okay, young lady, you listen, and you listen good.
There will be no smooching, no--  They're here.
Play with my doll.
Hm?
Trick or treat.
Hey, good call on not wearing a costume.
Where are the guys?
- Pretty scary, huh?
- On a lot of levels.
Cool.
A storm.
Hope my little brother's okay.
He's going as the tin man.
I bet it's gonna rain.
Perfect night to watch scary movies.
Yeah.
Remains of the Day?
Enchanted April?
The Bridges of Madison County?
Sorry.
We got to the movie store kind of late and these were the only scary movies we could find.
Well, come on in.
The hoagies are on, the root beer's chilled.
Very funny, Salem.
Five's a crowd, doll.
- Now, remember-- - When you want me to shoot you and put you out of your misery, you'll scratch your nose.
Right.
Now brace yourself for an evening of awkward conversation and disturbing smells.
- What is it?
- Clint Eastwood just took his shirt off.
Nothing worse than cold popcorn, uh.
I'll, uh-- I'll be right back with some more.
You're just a doll.
You didn't smile at me, right?
I'm a Molly Dolly.
Salem, please tell me you're throwing your voice.
Mm?
Not me.
Too many caramels.
Hilda, stop it.
We're not leaving until we find Aunt Beulah.
Excuse me.
Are you Aunt Beulah?
No.
I'm Delilah.
And I'm delighted to meet you.
They sound alike.
It's a real conversation starter.
Okay, she's not here.
Let's go.
Ladies, allow me to introduce myself.
I am Dr. Hans Egglehoffer.
The Dr. Hans Egglehoffer?
The renowned psychiatrist, author and surgeon?
Really?
Where?
Oh, that's me.
This party isn't going to be boring after all.
Dr. Egglehoffer is the foremost authority on slug reproduction.
Ooh, ask him if he's got a friend.
Hi, simply hi.
I'm Gary Owens.
The TV personality?
Oh, sure you are.
Yes, and I also have my own radio show heard nationwide by 15 million listeners.
Thank you.
Doesn't even sound like Gary Owens.
Is this a fabulous party or what?
Well, obviously, you've had a fewtoo many.
So after our perfunctory hellos and goodbyes to old Aunt Beulah, we'll drive you home.
But I am home.
But that would make you Aunt Beulah.
That's me.
Aunt Beulah.
Oh, darling.
We're so happy we finally made it.
Well, that's a load of bull honky, but I love it.
Listen up, everybody.
It's time for a toast.
I have been up all night making this candy corn.
Tell me what you think.
Be brutal.
Be brutal.
- It's kind of stale.
- Monster.
Okay.
Nobody's seen anything.
The night is still salvageable.
I'm a Molly Dolly.
I'm sure you're a nice dolly, but I don't have time-- - Sabrina?
- Valerie.
Why are you talking to a doll?
Because I don't believe in hitting them.
You have some trick-or-treaters, but none of us can open the door.
Trick-or-treaters?
What could they possibly want?
Make sure she doesn't get out of there.
A little time in the box might do her some good.
Wow, Mulan has quite an arm.
Hey, if you kids don't knock it off, I'm gonna break out the raisins.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
It must be an electrical storm, and you know how eggs conduct lightning.
- I'll just go try the back door.
- I'll help you.
No.
Look.
Another bridge.
Now I know why my mom loves this movie.
You know, you have a fascinating brain.
- I would love to study it.
- Oh, you're too kind.
Mind if I take a few measurements?
Don't you wanna try the cocktail wieners?
I hear they're good.
"If you like cocktail wieners, you'll love our new cheese log, made with 100 percent cheese and 50 percent log".
I hope this party's over while I'm still in my 500's.
I don't get it.
Excuse me.
Okay, I can't take it anymore.
I've had enough of this party and enough candy corn.
I wanna go home.
Don't you think I wanna leave?
But we can't during the toast.
It would just be rude.
After all these centuries, I'm celebrating Halloween with my dear nieces, Hilda and Zelda.
- Not now.
- I don't give a bat's behind.
I want to go home.
Well.
Uh, we'll just be leaving now.
Oh, that's impossible.
Oh, Bellevuedere.
This is an insane asylum.
No one leaves.
Ever.
It didn't say that on the invitation.
I'm a Molly Dolly.
- I know.
Wait.
You're behind all this.
Why'd you seal the doors?
How'd you get out of the box?
Where's Salem?
The Molly Dolly is bad.
Hide me behind the rye and close the door.
You sicken me.
Look, Molly "Psycho" Dolly, I don't know what you're up to, but if you don't unlock this house, I'm gonna throw you out in the traffic.
Well, as soon as you unlock this house.
I'm a Molly Dolly.
Stop that.
Can't you say anything else?
I'm a Molly Dolly, and I'm gonna get you.
That's not what I wanted to hear.
Look, Molly, I'm not afraid of you.
I don't know if you're aware of this, but I'm a witch.
Ooh, I'm scared.
Sarcasm not sold separately.
Look, I'm warning you.
I have friends over.
Oh, goody.
I have friends too.
Nice to meet you, Frank.
How'd the operation turn out?
Gotta go.
Hoagies repeating on you too, huh?
Do I hear a violin?
I need the practise.
Don't look.
I'm very self-conscious.
Not the sharpest pencil in the monster box, heh-heh.
You can't just keep us here.
We can just zap ourselves out.
What have you done with our magic?
You no longer have your power.
That's what the candy corn was for.
Oh, Bellevuedere.
You don't understand.
We do not belong in an insane asylum.
We don't even like Crazy Bread.
Maybe we'll have to subdue you.
Won't hurt a bit.
Not me, anyway.
- Run.
- Run.
I'm glad I wore my sensible shoes.
They were on sale at Fayva.
The prices were insane.
Okay, it's late.
Time to go.
See you at school.
I'm looking at a still photo.
Move.
- It's only 8:45.
- And the doors are stuck.
I'm pretty sure the mud porch is wide open.
Not anymore.
Don't go.
The knife-- I mean, the night has just begun.
And they say she's the next Teddy Ruxpin.
Who turned out the lights?
Me.
That's it.
I'm calling my aunts for help.
The phone's dead.
If you're a teenager scared out of your wits, press the pound key now.
I shouldn't tell you this, but it may be our only chance for survival.
That doll has magical powers.
It's out to get all of us.
Run!
Hide!
Save yourselves!
Sabrina, when you do a prank, you go all out.
I heard about your river of candy corn.
It's not a prank.
We're never gonna get to see Enchanted April!
All right, I think we've lost Bellevuedere.
Luckily, we were running, he was frolicking.
Oh, great.
An exit.
We can escape.
Nope, just an escape from reality.
Quick.
Bellevuedere's coming.
I know a way out.
Oh, thank goodness, Delilah.
You're the only sane person here.
Delilah?
My name's not Delilah.
It's Fred.
Don't make me turn this car around.
It's funny.
I never thought I'd die this way.
- Not really funny ha-ha.
- No.
More funny ha-ha-ha-ha.
Well, I thought it was funny.
There's gotta be a flashlight around here somewhere.
Are we afraid of the dark?
Can we take out her batteries?
I can't find a candle, a match, a torch There's never an angry mob around when you need one.
Here's some light.
Maybe we could put a bag over her head.
DOLL : Merrily, merrily Merrily, merrily Life is but a scream Sabrina, I know you went to a lot of trouble, but sometimes pranks can go too far.
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
What am I gonna do?
There's no spell to stop killer dolls.
Well, at least find one to turn on the lights.
I don't believe this.
Clap on.
Well, good.
We have light.
Maybe now we have a fighting chance against Molly.
Come on, Salem.
Oh, wait.
There's the exit.
Let's go.
No.
They're not gonna fool us this time.
I'm onto them.
Laboratory, my eye.
I don't know about you, but I wish we would have tried that door marked "Exit".
How kind of you to join us.
I realise you've been captured.
I'm just being ironic.
Come in.
Here, sit, sit, sit.
Sit here, ah.
Now, I will attempt to switch your brains with the brains of the two chickens over there.
What?
You will do no such thing.
You should have heard the chickens complaining.
You're lucky.
Usually his experiments are kind of crackpot.
And that was "They're Coming To Take Me Away".
Next up: "They're Coming To Take Me Away".
Let the experiment begin.
Everyone's hiding?
Come out, come out wherever you are.
That's it.
You're going down, you little plastic nightmare.
Your winking days are over.
Way to go, Sabrina.
My plan to pretend I was a coward worked.
Okay.
Now all I have to do is go wrestle Frankenstein, the mummy and all those other freaks.
I'll go get my aunts.
You'll never get away with this.
You'd better hope Aunt Beulah saved your receipt.
You don't toy with Sabrina, especially if you're a toy.
Oh, really?
Sabrina.
Sab-- Sa-- Next up: "Crazy".
Oh.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda, you've gotta help me.
Aunt Beulah's doll is wacko.
Harvey, Valerie and Justin are gonna die.
What am I going to do?
Could you be a little bit more specific?
What a lovely cranium, my dear.
Mind if I borrow it?
ZELDA : Leave her alone.
Sabrina, over here.
Okay, so, what am I gonna do?
First, we've got to figure out how we can not be chickens anymore.
You must be Sabrina.
Everyone, I want you to meet my great-niece, Sabrina.
Hey.
That's my name too.
Aunt Beulah, please don't turn Sabrina into a chicken.
She's so young.
HILDA : And high school's so-- Oh, no.
Something's happening to me.
- I'm laying an egg.
- Oh, that's what happened to me when I tried to do Music Man in dinner theatre.
Don't worry.
Nothing's going to happen to Sabrina.
This isn't an insane asylum.
It's a theme party.
You mean this whole thing is a joke?
If you'd come to my last 500 parties, you would know.
Last year, we had a prison riot.
Excuse me.
I hate to be the only adult here, but I have a problem with my doll.
Oh, no, I hope I didn't send you the wrong one.
Zelda and Hilda.
Let's go.
I know I'm a healthy alternative to red meat, but change me back.
- Isn't this fun?
See what she's doing?
Oh, what's the problem?
This is the right doll.
I thought Molly would be fun for Halloween.
No.
You see, in this realm, we don't give toys like this to children.
Fine.
I'll stop her.
- I'll stop terrorizing if you stop yelling.
- Deal.
Okay, guys, pack it up.
Party's over.
Oh, you should have seen the look on your faces.
Great prank, huh?
Yeah, it was great.
But we were onto you.
So you guys wanna watch the rest of the movies?
No!
Oh, honey, are you okay?
Excuse me.
Oh, sure.
It's not every day a girl has Frankenstein, the Mummy, a vampire, the Headless Horseman and a werewolf on her double date.
Molly, I didn't tell you to send a werewolf.
And I didn't.
I think I finally got him calmed down.
Don't make any sudden noises.
Was it real, or wasn't it?
I know that was scary, but don't worry, kids.
It's all behind us now.
Hilda, get ahold of yourself.
Ah.
Thanks.
I needed that.
Oh, no.
We've been invited to Aunt Beulah's Halloween party.
Aunt Beulah?
I've never met her.
Huh?
Ahh!
It never ends.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
You pays your money and you takes your chances, Rusty.
Bite me.
You've been lucky all night.
That's Lucky over there, with the poker face.
- Uh-huh.
- What do you got?
Just deal.
Ah-ha.
- I'll call.
- A pair of eights.
Three of a kind.
Come to Papa!
- Oh, no, not again.
- How does he do it?
- It's like he's got radar or something.
- Yep.
Rusty, there's a coaster right there.
Is it so hard to put your beer on it?
- Sorry.
- God, it stinks in here.
Don't you guys know how bad smoking is for you?
Hey!
Easy!
Easy!
Okay, that does it.
From now on, we play at Lassie's house.
Pick me!
Pick me!
Well, thanks for listening.
I know the results of my Sassy quiz can't be all that interesting.
Sure they are.
Now, how did you score on sassitude?
Ever get the feeling you're missing something?
- Hey, what's going on?
- Libby just pulled up in her new car.
Libby has wheelage?
Well, it's nice to know that good things happen to horrible people.
I know everyone is going to want a ride, so I should warn you, the selection process will be Darwinian, survival of the cutest.
Can you believe the way everyone's worshiping her?
- Let's just ignore her.
- Okay, so, um Why do you think you scored so low on that quiz?
I gotta tell you, I think you are the kind of girl that other girls respect.
Thanks.
You really wanna look at the car, don't you?
- Do you mind?
- It's your DNA talking.
I understand.
Hello, Roast Beef?
This is Katmandu.
Give me ten cans of tuna on the Seahawks, and I'll call you before post time at Pimlico.
Later.
Salem, I thought I told you gambling is illegal in my living room.
I'm on a roll, slim.
This is my shot at some real action.
Not just fleecing the neighbourhood cats in Boggle.
What, bingo at Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow?
Try the hippest poker game in the Other Realm, hosted by none other than Diamond Dave LaRouche.
- The Diamond Dave?
- Born to misbehave.
The wiliest gambler west of the crack in time?
- He the man.
- Absolutely not.
Oh, yeah-- Huh?
Salem, you know I despise gambling.
It's throwing away good money.
Besides, no one wins against Diamond Dave.
But I'm red hot.
Not even double D can stop this streak.
- Please.
- The subject is closed.
Besides, you can't get to the Other Realm on your own, - so you might as well forget about it.
- I'll buy you something pretty.
Cool car, Libby.
People are acting like Libby's dad bought her a shuttle.
- It's just a car!
- Convertible.
With the CD player in the trunk.
All the controls are on the steering wheel.
You're not helping.
You guys hear about the class trip to the Celtics game?
Let me guess.
Your dad bought you the Celtics too?
Nice try, Freaka, warrior princess.
I was just wondering if Harvey needed a ride.
Don't you have to take the bus to those things?
Not if you have a car.
The school bus is gonna look like a magnet school for losers.
Well, that's why we were gonna take Harvey's car, right?
Right.
Except it's up on blocks.
For how long?
You can count on it for graduation.
Well, I'll be saving shotgun for you, Harvey.
And Claude the bus driver will be saving shotgun for you.
We have got to get a car.
Do you realise what this stamped and sealed envelope represents?
Yet another unrequited love letter to Robert Downey Jr.?
You are incorrect.
This is the final mortgage payment on our house.
You're kidding!
It's really ours now?
Yep, electrical work that's not up to code and all.
Let me guess.
It's double coupon day at the market?
- Honey, we paid off the house.
- It's really ours now!
Woo-hoo!
Wait a minute!
That's great!
Now that you have some free cash lying around, you can take on car payments for your favourite niece.
Not gonna happen.
But come on!
Don't quit!
We're jumping, it's a great day.
Sabrina, we've been over this a hundred times.
You're not responsible enough for a car yet.
Well, the least you could do is let me borrow your car for the Tuesday field trip.
Oh, we can't.
A group of scientists are gonna line our cars up and floor them, to see if we can reverse the Earth's rotation.
Just an excuse to meet people, but I made a commitment.
I'd trade all my magical powers for an '83 LeBaron with low mileage.
Sabrina, most kids in high school don't have cars - and they do just fine.
- The bus will be fun.
Fine.
But bear in mind that a car is less expensive than a lifetime of psychotherapy.
You didn't see me.
Well, you're kind of hard to miss in your Sunday-go-to-meeting suit.
Don't tell the brain trust downstairs, but I've been invited to play poker at Diamond Dave's high-roller suite.
- And that's a good thing?
- Are you kidding?
This is my chance to pocket some serious simoleons, greenbacks, dinero, moola, shekels, scratch, wampum - And those are?
- Money, baby.
Oh.
- Oh, hey, could you buy me a car?
- Page me next week.
Right now I need every penny to play the legend.
Mr. Saberhagen?
Ah.
Homina, homina, homina.
Welcome to what we at Diamond Dave's - call "VIP plus".
Finally!
I'm gonna get comped!
Good luck.
And buy me a car when you come back.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do you gals make your own costumes?
I bet she has a car.
Guess I'll just have to conjure up the car myself.
Okay, let's see.
Essence of tyre burn.
Myrrh.
And STP, "The Racer's Edge".
Yes!
Let's see how popular Libby is when I'm mobile.
No!
I told you it was a good idea to activate that uninsured teen driver block.
Sabrina, it's just a bus.
Well, can't I tap into my college fund?
Four of a kind.
Well, what do you know?
A royal flush.
- Gee, that sounds better.
- It is.
That's the fifth straight hand you've won.
That's why they call him Diamond Dave.
Not Amber Dave, not Aquamarine Dave.
"Diamond Dave".
And that's why I can afford to have a butler who sits on his butt when my Fanta needs refreshing.
Right, boss.
Are you sure you don't want a break?
Are you nuts?
Now I've got you right where I want you.
The game is high-low criss-cross Mexican stud poker, deuces and bugs are wild.
Did you catch any of that?
Number three was the lightest pencil I could find.
Maybe if I don't press too hard, people won't notice.
The trip is next week, people, so it's crunch time for those of you who haven't purchased gifts yet.
Have you made up your mind, Harvey?
Thanks, Libby, but I really had my heart set on the bus.
Suit yourself.
I'll try not to gun it as I pass you on the thruway.
Thanks, Harvey.
That was really nice of you.
Hey, if we're on the bus, then the bus is the cool way to go to the field trip.
Well, you know it doesn't work that way, but thanks.
But I thought a face card beats an eight.
But, Salem, eights are wild.
Five-card draw.
Ante up.
Last chip, last chance.
Huh.
Oh, yeah!
You are not gonna believe this hand!
Just bend over and kiss my furry-- I believe it's your turn.
And I believe I'm gonna raise you.
Unbelievable.
I finally get a winner, and I can't raise.
I've given you everything I own.
My traveller's cheques, my X-Men number one in near-mint condition, my Beanie Babies.
I'm tapped out.
Well, I'd really like to work with you here.
Do you own any property?
Hmm.
This brown one would be good.
Or maybe this beige one.
I like the beige one.
It brings out your immaturity.
Immature?
My life is over, people!
Where's your medallion, Salem?
Diamond Dave said he could melt it down and sell the gold to a dentist.
Tell me you didn't play him.
Kind of, sort of.
And I got into a little trouble.
See, I kind of bet something that wasn't mine to bet.
More like Well, actually, it was yours.
Kind of a big thing.
Please tell me you didn't bet the house.
How do I say this?
Oh, boy, I'm feeling woozy.
Okay.
- Did you bet this house?
Well, no.
Actually, I bet you.
They seemed to take that pretty well.
Did you guys paint the piano?
Ah, ladies, welcome to the gaming floor.
- Diamond Dave.
- You mean, Salem bet us?
- And lost?
- Oh, this is absurd.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Your magic's no good here, and neither is your credit.
I won you fair and square in a game of Texas hold'em.
A game sanctioned by the Other Realm Bureau of Gaming and Fishing.
For the next 20 years, you'll be doing menial jobs for me.
And Diamond Dave likes things done the mortal way.
You will be my new cook.
That cat is going straight to the pound.
And you are my new maid!
That cat is going straight to a violin factory.
And you-- You will be my new personal assistant.
Wait!
You can't keep us here.
I have a life and-- And a boyfriend, and-- Did I happen to mention the job includes driving my Porsche?
Woo-hoo!
No fair.
She got a cute uniform.
It's my business to be popular.
You ladies are now part of that formula, and I like my ladies upbeat and zesty.
We are cleaning, and we are smiling.
I'd like to start with a light meal, burnt bacon, peanut butter, four bananas, hand-mashed in a bowl.
Would you like a spoon or a straw with that?
In the grotto, and today, cookie.
Everybody heard that?
I get to drive a Porsche, right?
He called me "cookie".
We've got to find a way out, and, of course, Salem will help.
I'm okay!
That was so much fun.
Not bad for my first time driving stick, huh?
I'll be in the grotto until the guests arrive, and what do we say, Hilda, when I come home?
- Evening, governor.
- Needs work.
Diamond Dave wasn't kidding when he said he was popular.
It's like driving around with the pope.
People fawning all over you is very overrated.
I don't need that kind of attention, as I pointed out on my website.
He's starting to remind me of Libby.
I'm starting to think that money is the root of all popularity.
Don't forget fear.
Well, Libby has that too.
Sabrina, money is just a shortcut to popularity, and shortcuts never work.
Well, they do for Diamond Dave.
You look awful.
What's the matter?
Oh, something to do with chitlins.
Look, I have a plan to get us out of here.
I want each of you to get me two of the ingredients on this list.
But we can't use magic.
Our fingers may have crapped out, but we can make a sleeping potion, and I'll mix it into Diamond Dave's next culinary atrocity.
If it works, we can make a break for it while he and C.K. are zonked out.
I am so in.
Did I mention I'm driving a Porsche?
Okay, I'm in too.
ZELDA : All we need is the feather of a fowl, preferably ostrich or emu.
Two ounces of chlorophyll.
A tad of faux animal fur.
Try not to damage the coat when you take it.
Some body hair, the coarser the better.
And top it off with a little alcohol for flavour.
Toss in a little more of that comb cleaner.
One sip of this, and he'll be out for a week.
And I haven't even added the nose hairs yet.
Shh.
It's only natural to get carried away when we're gathered over a cauldron.
But remember, this potion is our last resort.
I'm still hoping Salem will save us.
Woo, doggie!
Yee-haw!
Okay, I've had my fun.
Now I've got a family to save.
Ooh, my wontons.
I have to say, you gals are doing a stellar job.
C.K., if I were you, I would definitely be hearing footsteps.
That's a good one, double D.  Okay, who's ready for some tongue, mini-marshmallow and yam soup?
Just like Mama used to make.
Zelda, the grub has been magnifico, but, you know, I've been thinking of making Hilda my official food taster.
What?
And deprive you?
Well, I've been so hot at the tables recently, you never know who might be messing with my lucky meals, and we might as well start with a steaming bowl of tongue.
But C.K. has seniority.
Yeah, he should have the honour.
That bum?
I give him a gift every day I don't can him.
I think I'm starting to see a pattern in your humour.
Here.
You've earned it, Hilda.
Go ahead, unless there's something wrong with it.
Oh, you know what?
It's chunky style.
That's my favourite.
Uh-huh.
I find that highly suspicious.
She's tired.
- She's been working really hard.
- Yeah.
Don't let us interrupt your dinner.
You witches dosed my dinner.
Does this mean I get to cook for you again?
Nice try, ladies.
I hope you enjoy your new job, manning the septic tank.
I still get to drive the Porsche, right?
What?
Oh, man!
I dreamt I was out of food.
Woo.
Check out all the dead soldiers.
Wait a minute.
I am out of food.
Now I've really gotta save them!
Whoa.
Easy on the bunion, princess.
When you're done, use the clear polish.
Not that frosty stuff you used last time.
It's called Lady Meringue.
Can I get you anything?
How about a friend to watch my back?
Double D, I said I was sorry about the food thing.
"The food thing"?
You mean the attempt to poison me?
Why would I wanna hurt you?
You're my oldest friend.
He's your oldest friend?
We went to school together.
I gave him a kidney.
He gave you a kidney?
What did I say when we signed the release forms?
- No guilt trips.
- Come on, Dave.
- You're fired.
C.K.: But, Dave-- You heard me.
Now mush.
If that's the way you want it.
But just remember this.
The only reason you aren't alone in this house is because you're good with a deck of cards.
As a human being, you're strictly an amateur.
Well, you know what?
That kidney you gave me isn't exactly a Cadillac.
How could you do that to C.K.?
I mean, he may be a kiss-up with no personality, but he's your friend.
Sabrina, as long as I have money, I'll have friends.
But they aren't real friends.
And you're not really a butler, but you'll be doing C.K.'s job from now on.
You can start by answering the doorbell.
Diamond Dave?
Allow me to introduce Mr. Catchow, an incredibly irresponsible Asian gambler.
Me crazy for Pai Gow.
- What was that?
- Oh, look, a putty tat.
The potion still hasn't worn off.
What exactly was your plan?
Um This is pretty much it.
I figured once I got inside, I'd get inspired.
Perfect.
Now you're all mine.
And I got myself a new shoe buffer.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
This is hugely unfair.
We can't be held responsible for anything that a professional gambler wins from a common house pet.
A house pet who's rated by Caesars Palace.
How about a game, just you and me?
If I win, we all get to go home.
And if you lose?
We'll stay for 100 years and clean your garage.
Sabrina, no, we're witches.
Twenty years is a drop in the bucket to us.
It may take Hilda that long to straighten up.
You look so familiar to me.
Sit like a lady, dear.
Sabrina, I'll see your bet, and raise you.
If I win, you all stay here with me forever.
- Done.
- Poker?
No.
My game.
- Chutes and Ladders?
- My game, my rules.
- Only if I get to be Butch.
- Done.
--Four, five, six.
One, two-- Shoot.
A chute.
I haven't lost this game since kindergarten.
I ain't gonna start now.
We did say two out of three, right?
I am so close to the winner's circle, I can smell the champagne.
Sabrina, that has to be your last chute.
It's not like I'm doing this on purpose, Aunt Zelda.
Yes!
Six sweet steps to victory.
Oh, the glory of it all.
I can't believe it.
This is my game!
- Not anymore, kid.
- It's all right, Sabrina.
You played great.
And it's not like forever lasts-- Oh, dear lord, forever.
Is the room spinning or is it me?
She's having a reaction to the potion.
Hey, Saint Vitus' dance, take it outside.
You know what, big shot?
I spit in your grotto.
I think we need to put some coffee on for Aunt Tipsy.
You know what?
I never liked you, and your cleft really bugs me.
Oh, dear.
Oh, this is bad.
This is very bad.
I'm so sorry, Diamond-- Is it me, or is Diamond Dave slumped over the table breathing yet clearly unconscious?
That's a pretty fair assessment.
Hey!
Look, he had extra dice up his sleeve, and it's all sixes.
- No wonder he always won.
- Let's get out of here.
He must have cheated with me too.
I was robbed!
I should at least get the Leroy Neiman painting as compensation.
Ow.
My head!
I said I was super-sorry.
If I say it again, will you save my racing forms?
No.
You're not even allowed to watch Wheel of Fortune.
Morning.
I'm late.
I promise to eat all the unbruised parts on the bus.
Are you gonna be okay about taking the bus to the field trip?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
You know, after a week at Diamond Dave's, I can honestly say that I do not want to be like Libby.
It's not money that makes you happy.
It's friends like Harvey, who ride the stupid loser bus with you.
Oh, we're so glad you see that.
Aren't we, Hilda?
Ow.
One more thing before you go.
- You're killing me here.
- Oh, I think you'll make it on time.
We decided you deserved a little reward for having such a good attitude.
But just for today.
What are you, a secret agent or something?
- Hop in.
- Hey, check out Sabrina's ride.
Where did you get that?
Oh, my aunt's waggon broke down.
This is a loaner.
I'd offer rides, but it's a two-seater.
- Hey, where are you going?
- I think the bus is coming.
If I'm not gonna ride in a Porsche, what's the difference?
But I have an opening.
Next to an air bag.
Come back!
We'll try not to gun it when we pass you on the thruway.
Any threes?
Go fish.
Any fives?
Yes, and I had my heart set on that new can of tennis balls.
Uh.
Read them and weep.
Pay the lady.
- My wife's gonna kill me.
- Hey, I won fair and square, and I'm taking my winnings.
And buying you all rawhide treats.
God bless this woman.
All right!
Yeah.
- Okay, settle down.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Wow, all this just because I finished my invention for school?
You shouldn't have.
Even though I did spend three weeks working on it, not to mention missing The English Patient on HBO 61 times.
Cool your jets, Edison.
The horns don't toot for you.
This is for our cousin Larry.
- What did he invent?
- Nothing.
But cousin Larry has come to expect some fanfare since he became an Other Realm emperor.
He has his own country, I get dirty looks for taking up too much couch space.
Here he comes.
Zelda.
What a delight.
This must be Sabrina.
- Kiss my ring.
- But I hardly know it.
I can't wait to talk to you about the family--  I have a--  Two witches walk into a bar.
Stop me if you've heard this one.
So where is your lovely sister?
She's at her high school equivalency reunion.
They hold it every year.
At Costco.
Oh, I'm gonna be late for my symposium in the Other Realm.
I've proved yet another unsolvable theorem.
Yes, well, before you go, I must tell you, I've discovered a very curious fact.
You're your own grandpa?
I found out that Zelda is the rincess of Massapequa Park.
The country that borders my country, Massapequa.
Aunt Zelda's a princess?
Not puh, just er.
Really tiny countries can't afford a whole princess.
Okay, but nonetheless, Aunt Zelda, there's a whole country for you to run, and me to inherit.
Back off, Napoleon.
Zelda promised me my own sovereign state for my birthday.
Or was it a chew toy?
We witches live so long that we constantly accumulate useless land.
Just last week, I found out I own a driveway in Ashtabula.
Would you like me to take the country off your hands?
- Would you?
- I've got the papers right here.
Just one little signature.
If you press really hard.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to sign these after my symposium.
So, Sabrina, finally we get to talk about the family secret.
I'd love to, Emperor Larry, but I've gotta get to school.
Today's the invention fair, and mine is really cool.
I think I know the family secret: Lack of proper excitement over teenage achievements.
It's a combination hairdryer-lipstick applicator.
Excellent.
I see them in hotels everywhere.
Except Europe, where the current's weird.
- So, what does yours do?
- Oh.
It filters the water from the school's water cooler, leaving only pure H2O.
Watch.
Wow, the water's so pure, I'm still thirsty.
- Sabrina.
- You're gonna win for sure.
Thanks.
It's so nice to have someone else excited about it.
My aunts didn't even care that our tap water has radon.
All systems are go for the first-ever pepperoni pizza putty prototype.
Does the pepperoni pizza putty prototype have a point?
Say you order a plain cheese pizza and it arrives with pepperoni.
Simply place the pepperoni pizza putty prototype like so, and voilÃ .
Hey, it really works.
One question: why don't you just pick the pepperoni off with your fingers?
What do I look like, an animal?
Valerie, I like your invention.
- Really?
- What about mine?
Excellent, as usual.
Nice work.
Thank you.
Huh, swell.
Now I look like one of Red Skelton's paintings.
Coming through.
Harvey, I think someone studied.
All right.
C-plus.
B-minus.
Yes!
Once again, I'm comfortably ensconced in the middle of the bell curve.
All right, Valerie.
- I got an A. - As usual.
Uh, Mrs. Quick, I'm not sure, but is this an A?
Actually, it's an A-plus.
Now let's all turn to chapter 11.
Just getting ready for the millennium.
- Oh, I got third place.
That's great.
First!
I got first place.
I got a green participant ribbon.
- Congratulations.
- I got third.
All right.
- And I got first.
- Knew it.
- I told you it was a good invention.
- Thank you.
Well, nice work, Kinkle.
You're the only football player to actually finish an invention.
- What about me?
- Hello.
Hey, Valerie.
I heard you got third.
- Cool.
- Thank you.
- Hey, Sabrina-- - Yes, I did.
- I mean, you go first.
- We're doing a walk for orphans.
- Do you wanna sign up?
- Why?
So I can do great, be the best, walk the most and have everyone ignore it?
Actually, it's so the orphans can get cable.
Oh, hi, honey.
I wasn't expecting you home for lunch.
What's the matter?
I got an A-plus on a really hard test, won a blue ribbon on my invention.
- Uh-huh.
So, what's the problem?
- That.
No one's excited.
Oh, honey, it's just that you get A's and win things so often, you can't expect a parade every time.
How about one person walking by with a hearty, "Well done"?
I, on the other hand, solved an ancient math problem and the Other Realm scientists sat there like a group of mutes.
Of course, now that they're covered with smallpox they might be livelier.
I would just like one person to get a little keyed up.
Huh!
Sabrina, did I dream it, or did you win a blue ribbon?
Yes, I did.
Is that available for shredding?
This magic book is useless.
It shouldn't take this long to find a quick fix.
What are you looking for?
When I go back to school, I want my good work acknowledged.
But I haven't found anything under awards, accolades, prizes-- Not even lip service.
Check the recipe section.
Just do it.
Do it.
- It's just desserts.
- Exactly.
That's what you want, your just desserts.
Oh, I see.
"With one little bite of this just dessert you'll get the recognition your good work deserves".
Cool.
Wow.
You're lucky.
When I was a witch, just desserts was a prune.
An old prune.
Aunt Zelda, this is Olga and Zampano from your country in the Other Realm.
What do they want?
Your greatness knows no bounds oh, great rincess.
Seeing you brings honour to my whole family.
I'm just guessing, but I'd say they're here to worship you.
Okay, just dessert, I hope you bring me praise and not just cavities.
Sabrina, you got an A on your math test.
Hey, everyone, Sabrina got an A. Sabrina also won the invention contest or have you forgotten that?
Not at all.
Look.
"In honour of Sabrina Spellman".
And I didn't even have to die.
Okay, okay.
Everybody, attention.
Because of the outstanding work that Sabrina has done on her schoolwork, the school board has decided that no existing grade is adequate.
So, Sabrina, we give you this:  Okay, I have to remember to be modest and humble and Oh, the heck with it.
This is great.
Thank you.
Oh, go on.
You couldn't admire all my work.
But we do, rincess.
Your face is on all our money.
We assume you shaved your beard.
Ah, I thought I heard you, Zelda.
Ready to sign the papers?
You know what?
I think I'll hold on to my country.
Well, it's your country.
It's your choice.
- Right.
- Of course, this means war.
- What?
- Change your mind?
- No.
- Neither did I. You promised me that country, and I want it.
Prepare to fight.
Fine.
Would this be a good time to discuss taxes?
How did your just desserts turn out?
Great.
But that little bit of acclaim has given me quite a sweet tooth.
Don't do it, Sabrina.
You're only supposed to eat one bite.
I know, I know, but a couple more won't hurt.
Sabrina Way to eat cake.
I can't believe I ate the whole cake.
Ooh, crumbs.
Whoa.
Sabrina.
The way you closed your locker, that was awesome.
Yeah, I'm thinking of going pro.
- Sabrina, do that again.
- Do what again?
That thing where you let oxygen into your mouth and carbon dioxide out.
- You mean breathing?
- Yes.
That's amazing.
Oh, there you go again.
Oh, you know me, I'm a fool when it comes to keeping myself alive.
May I?
Zampano, you beast.
It is mine.
You already have her napkin.
So, milady, now that you and Emperor Larry are at war, might I suggest you leave certain strategies to Minister of Defence Saberhagen?
No, you mightn't suggest that.
You're not my minister of defence.
You're not involved in this in any way.
Scat.
This is going to be very awkward to tell my staff.
Rincess Zelda, I am but a simple peasant in roughly woven garments, but may I be your footstool?
Well, okay.
But as long as you maintain your dignity.
Obviously, when Zelda said, "scat," she was speaking in code.
Let's see, if I translate it into Esperanto, and back into Hebrew Right.
I'm pretty sure she meant, "Destroy Emperor Larry and all he holds dear, so Salem can rule his country".
Give or take a letter or two.
As you all know, I was planning to give you another test today, but I've decided to skip the test and just give Sabrina the A. Really?
Thank you.
I even bought party hats and trail mix, so we can all celebrate Sabrina's A. Hey, everybody.
They just declared peace in-- Excuse me, Sabrina got an A. Wait a minute, Sabrina got yet another A?
And-- And I don't have a hat.
People who put fawning down just aren't getting any.
I hope Emperor Larry likes this sleeping potion, because it's the last thing he'll ever taste.
Salem, what are you doing?
Making s'mores.
Well, don't make a mess.
I've got battles to plan, and I don't have time to clean.
Yeah, I'm making s'mores.
S'more poison for Emperor Larry.
Look, it's Sabrina, woo-hoo!
- What's the parade for?
- If they can have a parade honouring men who have merely walked on the moon, I think we can have one honouring a little girl who has done her literature homework.
A letter from the Other Realm.
You could have just brought the letter.
You didn't need to bring the scalding toaster.
Oh, it's from the Witches' Council.
They wanna have a dinner honouring my achievements in math and science.
That's wonderful.
But what is this math and science of which you speak?
My work.
You said you admired all my work.
That we've seen so far.
Then you just adore me because you think you should, not because I deserve it.
I've got to find Emperor Larry.
Great.
We're under attack.
This assembly was called to honour everyone who worked so hard on the walk for orphans.
I didn't know there was an assembly.
But we've decided to turn it into the first annual Sabrina Awards instead.
All right, show's over, do-gooders.
Take a seat.
Go on.
Hit it.
S is because She's so sublime A is because She's awesome all the time B is because She's the best babe in school R because she really makes me drool And I is for The icon she's become N is because she's great She makes me numb And A, it's redundant to say Is the great mark she gets every day No matter how it's spelled Sabrina is unparalleled Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina, Sabrina Sabrina - Sa - Bri Na  Salem, I have to get in touch with Emperor Larry.
I've made a huge mistake.
I wanted recognition.
I didn't care who--  Look out.
Duck.
Dive.
Salem, what is going on?
I set up a bunch of booby traps for Emperor Larry.
Remember?
You told me to terminate with extreme prejudice.
- I never said that.
- Sure, nitpick.
Well, I am sure being here at the first annual Sabrina Awards means there is going to be lots of entertainment tonight.
Jeez, who writes this garbage?
Well, that-- That would be me.
Um, it's you again.
And the nominees for Best Relaxed Sabrina Moment are: Sabrina eating lunch.
Sabrina leafing through a magazine in Study Hall.
Sabrina humming a Phantom Planet song she heard on the radio that morning and can't get out of her head.
Sabrina at this very moment.
And the Sabrina goes to Open it, open it, open it.
Oh, my goodness, the Sabrina goes to Sabrina Spellman.
Oh, what a beautiful award.
Well, the Sabrinas are such an honour, and I'd just like to share this award with everyone else nominated in this category.
Thank you.
So Massapequa Park is all yours.
I surrender.
No.
Excellent.
- Can I make a quick call?
- Certainly.
If I can get my sentry on the cell phone, I might be able to call off that napalm attack.
Rincess Zelda, your scones are ready.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
I've decided to abdicate my throne.
- I blame you.
- No, no, no.
Look, maybe I should go to my country, and explain my decision to the rest of the population.
- You mean Isadore?
- Is that the capital?
No.
Isadore is a man.
The rest of the population, in fact.
You love him, don't you?
Only three people live in my country?
Yes, and despite that, parking is still a nightmare.
Come on.
They're about to announce another winner, and it could be you.
I'll tell you what, why don't you go accept for me?
Oh, boy.
I'll be sure to mention that you're for Native Americans and against fur.
Okay.
Oh, Sabrina, congratulations.
I just knew you'd win for Best Supporting Sabrina.
Gordie, you really worked hard for those orphans, didn't you?
Well Ah, heck, not as hard as you did on that Jumble this morning.
Well, I did use ink.
But Well, I feel awful.
And the winner is Look at this, we have a tie.
Sabrina and Sabrina.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Sit down, for crying out loud.
Look, all I wanted was a little recognition for doing a good job.
But not at the expense of those who are truly deserving.
So I'm giving all my Sabrinas to Gordie and the other do-gooders.
What's Sabrina doing?
This never happens at the American Music Awards.
Cue the band.
Cue the band.
So it turns out constant praise isn't all it's cracked up to be.
From now on, all I want my hard work to bring me is a high school diploma, admittance to a good college and a high-paying job with benefits.
But that's it.
I'm sorry.
I should have been more helpful.
If I hadn't been so busy thinking about myself, I would have remembered to tell you that good work is its own reward.
But how do I end this spell now without winning a Pulitzer for my book report?
Eat this and the spell will be reversed.
- What is it?
- Humble pie.
Oh, that's awful.
Oh, I'll never get the taste of humility out of my mouth.
Well, I'd love to sit and chat, but I am being honoured in the Other Realm.
Finally.
Excuse me, your majesty, but it seems someone else could use a piece of humble pie.
But it was a really hard problem.
Well, all right, but just a small piece.
Zelda, let me make one more plea for rethinking this surrender foolishness.
I just know Larry's rear flank is vulnerable.
Salem, as someone once said to Alexander the Great: have some pie.
Another C-plus?
- Yes.
- Nice work, Harvey.
- B-minus.
- Nice work, Valerie.
- A. - Nice work, Sabrina.
Once again, you get an A, and nobody makes a big deal out of it.
Yes!
Next time, let's try to have a nice visit without going into a state of war.
Well, it won't be as much fun, but okay.
I almost forgot.
For you, a horn.
Let me guess: it's weird, it makes no sense, I don't know why I have it.
It must be a clue to the family secret.
You have got great deductive skill, Sabrina.
Maybe one day you can join one of my secret death squads.
Huh.
He's kind of fun for a tyrant.
Will we see him again?
Probably at the post-war reconstruction summit.
Somebody has to clean up the punji sticks in our front yard.
Oh, Salem, did you get rid of all those booby traps?
Absolutely.
What exactly happened while I was at school today?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I just love that new Other Realm Grocery.
Yeah, if there are more than three people in line, they just clone the cashier.
What'd you bring us?
Honey Frosted Fruity Cocoa Sugar Clumps, made with real candy.
But I asked for something sweet.
- And for you.
- Bubble gum?
So this is all part of a nutritious breakfast.
I don't believe it.
Send in just 500 box tops and get a genuine replica of the Epsilon III free.
Will anyone join me in saying, "Who cares"?
The Epsilon III was the first spaceship ever used in an Other Realm Earth landing.
I must have that spaceship.
Well, it'll take 500 boxes, and you're a cat without a job.
Then I'd better start crunching.
I've never had Other Realm gum.
This grape is pretty good.
But it can be pretty loud.
- It also comes in berry.
- What?
- It also comes in berry.
- What?
- Teenagers today just don't listen.
- What?
Let me get that spot.
Have you come up with suggestions on how to spend the money the alumni board donated?
How about a candy machine in the cafeteria?
- We already have one.
- Well, I'm good then.
I suggested a poetry bash.
We could have an after-school coffee shop where kids can read their poetry, and we could have famous poets come read their work.
Cool.
So they're not all dead?
If they can build a replica of the Epsilon III, you'd think they could make scissors a cat could use.
Salem, I need your help with a bow.
- Where did all this cereal come from?
- The good things in nature?
Okay, I kind of told the manufacturers I found a rat in one of their boxes, and they sent me ten free ones.
- What?
Salem, no more lies.
- Yes'm.
Salem, these just came for you.
"Hope this fulfils your dying friend's last wish for cereal".
Wasn't one of you coughing up blood and craving--?
Oh, forget it.
Didn't we agree not to exchange gifts for Pearl Harbor Day?
It's for Willard.
It's a leather detention-slip holder.
It's almost our two-month anniversary.
Wow, it's so great that you two have stayed together for two whole months.
I know.
You know, there's a sweet, kind, intellectual side to Willard that he almost never shows.
Yeah, usually he's just a big jackass.
You know, Sabrina, I've been working on a poem.
How sweet.
Can I hear it?
Sure.
Ahem.
Two showers dripped in a yellow locker room, and sorry I could not bathe in style.
I looked at one as far as I could to where it disappeared in the mouldy tile.
So it's not a love poem?
Okay.
Attention, everybody.
Ahem.
Your suggestions on how to spend the alumni money were surpassed in their dullness only by their lack of grammatical accuracy.
In fact, the only one that had any merit was the suggestion that we buy a new throne for the homecoming queen, submitted by the homecoming queen.
- Milady.
- Milord.
M'lunch.
Unfortunately, the other member of the committee liked "poetry bash," submitted by Sabrina Spellman, so there will be a brief campaign, and you students will vote.
- Great.
- How will you lose?
Oh, let me count the ways.
Hilda?
- Yeah.
We're out of cereal.
I'm gonna need you to pose for the botulism picture.
- What you doing?
- I'm trying to find a potion that will make Zelda realise how awful Willard really is.
Then she'll break up with him, and he can get back to the painful but necessary task of getting over me.
I know a little Other Realm candy shop that sells the best annoyance-amplifying sweets around.
That's perfect.
Zelda eats a chocolate, and all of Willard's already annoying qualities will be amplified.
- Where's the phone number?
- It's yours.
I know a cat who needs cereal.
Yes.
I'd like to order a one-pound box of your annoyance-amplifier chocolates.
Yeah.
I'll take, uh, some, "His voice makes my skin crawl," and give me four of, "He dresses like a polka bandleader".
Throw in a couple, "He smells like feet".
You got that?
Okay, and you do deliver, right?
That long, huh?
That was awkward.
We used to date.
"Throne".
"Throne".
"Throne".
"Mr. Kraft is a golf ball".
That's "goof ball".
"Throne".
- "Throne".
- So I guess your coalition of freaks and nerds never materialised.
Well, don't you worry.
They will.
This is all my fault.
My poetry stunk.
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.
No, this is all your fault.
You bought all those votes.
I bought them fair and square.
You know, why don't you surprise us all by changing, and doing something good and kind for once?
Why mess with success?
I think Zelda is meeting Willard this afternoon.
I have to get her to eat a couple of these before she sees him.
Yeah, yeah.
When it gets here, can I store my Epsilon III in the garage?
Salem, something arrived for you from the Other Realm.
Once again, you owe me the tip money.
Finally, my ship has come in.
Well, I'm off to join Willard at the homecoming pep rally.
That reminds me.
He came by earlier to drop off your anniversary gift.
Oh, Willie.
Oh, he knows I love chocolates.
Oh, I can't wait to thank him.
No, don't.
I wasn't supposed to give it to you until the actual day of your anniversary.
I guess I should wait till our actual anniversary to eat them then.
No, don't.
Why deny yourself?
Have some.
Take a few for the road.
Well, what's the harm?
And I did miss lunch.
And nougat is an excellent source of potassium.
This can't be it.
I can't pick up women in this.
- Who does Libby think she is?
- Maybe it inflates.
Sabrina, flip that switch.
She only cares about one person: Libby.
- Flip it.
- I know Aunt Zelda says you shouldn't change a person, but I would pay money to change Libby.
In the name of all that is dear in this world, flip the switch.
Fine.
We're inside the ship.
We're inside the ship.
Get us out of the ship.
Get us out of the ship.
Where's the stupid hatch on this thing?
We're shrinking.
We're shrinking.
Liftoff.
We have liftoff.
Yee-haw!
Rev it up.
Let's see what this baby can do.
Oh, I hate driving stick.
- Libby.
- Hi.
Sorry to just drop in like this, but Sabrina left school before they announced the winner of the campaign.
Oh, she won and you wanted to congratulate her?
No, sadly.
She lost and I thought I should be the one to tell her.
How thoughtful.
I'll see if she's here.
Sabrina, your friend Leona Helmsley is here.
Oh!
That was close.
If we survive this, someone's gotta tell her that she's got mustard on her cheek.
Excuse me.
I'm kind of in a rush here.
Mayday.
Mayday.
Nostril at 12:00.
It's flared!
Libby, can I get you a Kleenex?
Or a fire extinguisher?
Can we go again, huh?
Huh?
- Can we, huh?
- What happened?
Well, we flew up Libby's nose, and apparently crashed in her brain.
Oh.
And I was afraid something unusual happened.
Let's go out and play.
Last one to the cerebellum eats grey matter.
Perfect.
Hm.
No Sabrina, and a bug flies up my nose.
As always, it's been a lovely afternoon at the Spellman house.
Next time call first.
Give us a chance to move.
Will you take a gander at these synapses?
Hey, look.
There's Libby's eye.
It's the window to whatever she has instead of a soul.
Oh, no.
She's leaving.
We gotta get out of here.
- Hey.
- I just remembered.
Magic can't be transmitted by a witch - from inside a mortal brain.
- How do you know that?
I saw a special about this on the Witches' Discovery Channel.
So witches get stuck in mortal brains a lot?
Not as much as the witch media hypes it, but it does happen.
Oh, Mrs. Quick.
Have you seen Willard?
Oh, no, but just follow the sound of unwarranted hostility, and you're sure to find him.
Oh.
Zelda.
How wonderful to see you.
Are you ready for the rally?
I'm glad we arrived in Libby's brain early.
We got really good seats.
Look at this.
I found a radio in the spaceship.
Maybe we could call someone for help.
Do you think Mighty Mouse is free?
Oh, what am I saying?
It'll only do us some good if someone has the receiver.
The receiver's probably still in the box of cereal.
Help.
Somebody.
Anybody.
Help.
Help.
- Hello?
Hello?
- Aunt Hilda?
It's Sabrina.
Salem and I are in Libby's brain.
- I would have picked Aruba, but okay.
- No, we're trapped.
We were in Salem's toy spaceship and we flew up her nose.
If there had been boogers, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
I can't use magic to penetrate a mortal's brain.
I just saw something about this on the Witches' Discovery Channel.
Wasn't that a good show?
Now, aren't you glad we got cable?
Yeah, but the Sci-fi Channel's a rip-off.
Hey, I'm in a brain here.
Aunt Hilda, what are we gonna do?
- I suggest we send out for dim sum.
- Don't worry, Sabrina.
I'll get one of Zelda's books on the mortal brain.
Good thing we ordered that Time-Life series.
Don't go anywhere.
Where are we gonna go?
A day trip through the gallbladder?
Hi, honey.
I'd love to stay here with you, but I've gotta give my speech.
- Wish me luck.
Try not to throw up.
Try not to throw up.
Harvey.
If thee worships at mine feet, thine will buy thee a hoagie.
Have you seen Sabrina?
I stopped by her house to console her after that horrible defeat.
She was wearing a housecoat and eating Cheez Doodles.
I had to look away.
- I don't even own a housecoat.
- We have Cheez Doodles?
Is that new cologne?
Hey, I am the only one allowed to smell Harvey.
My fault.
My after-shave gives my mom a headache too.
I got it free when I bought tires.
"trapped in belly button, bile duct" Here we go.
"Brain".
Uh, breaker, breaker.
This is Kitchen Mama calling.
What do you want your handle to be?
- Aunt Hilda.
- Okay.
Aunt Hilda, I found a way for you to get out, - and it's so easy.
- How?
You just go out the same way you came in.
- You have to make Libby sneeze.
- How?
I have no idea, but it's gotta be easier than the other option: kicking a hole through her temples.
Thanks.
Even though we're doomed, you've been a big help.
Well, I'll keep looking.
And speaking of looking, have you seen, uh, Zelda and Willard anywhere?
Hello?
Okay.
How can we make Libby sneeze?
Pepper?
I bet dim sum has pepper in it.
Let's think.
Okay, we're in her brain, and the brain controls everything a person does, so maybe if we just stimulate the right part of the brain tissue, we can make her sneeze.
Gross, gross, gross.
- Or kill her.
- Did we do anything to her?
Everything seems A-okay.
So as you can see, the alumni money was well spent.
And now, the girl who puts the cheer in leader, the pep in rally  Lordy, love a duck, what's he wearing?
your queen and mine, Libby Chessler.
Why is he allowed to live?
Oh, I'm not touching anything until I hear from Aunt Hilda.
Then you'll want to avoid  that veiny thing.
Help.
I'm blind.
What's the matter, Libby?
You don't like your new throne?
Dear Willard, I'm breaking up with you, because you dress like an imbecile.
No, too harsh.
Dear Willard, you repulse me.
Stick it back.
I'm trying.
Gross, gross, gross.
Thank you.
I'll never bear false witness against Fluffy again.
Oh, no.
Libby's dimming.
Miss Chessler, are you mocking the noble institution of homecoming?
Sabrina, you might wanna try again with the slimy thing.
If we get out of this alive, you're never having cereal again.
Hey.
Miss Chessler.
Hey.
You go, girl.
Left.
Try left.
Too far.
- Mayday.
Mayday, Kitchen Mama!
- Okay.
I think I found something.
Hurry.
Libby won't stop slapping Mr. Kraft.
- Really?
- You moved it too far.
Now she's kissing him again.
Okay.
Here's what you have to do.
Find the main synapse.
It should be the large, dangling, dripping thing right over your head.
It's large, it's dangling.
- Yeah.
That's it.
Okay.
Now run it through your own brain.
Then you will be able to control Libby's thoughts and actions.
- How's it working?
- Salem?
It looks like we might never leave here.
Libby is twitching like a Central Park squirrel.
You have to do it.
Ugh.
I'll wash, but I'll never be clean.
Did it work?
- Did it work?
- Did what work?
My attempt to show how the world would be if there were no homecoming queens.
What, the whole world would start hitting me?
Libby, they're waiting for your speech.
I think you've got to walk for the girl.
Reunited with my love.
How about a little kissy-poo?
Get away from me.
Ugh!
Okay.
Speech time.
Make it a good one.
I just realised something.
realised something.
I hope you've got somewhere to go from there.
I just realised that I can make Libby say anything I want.
I can make her admit that she bought the election and that we should be having a poetry bash instead of a new homecoming throne.
I can change her.
Sabrina, did you make Libby sneeze yet?
Sneeze, schmeeze.
I got more important things to do.
I wanna thank everyone who voted for me.
It's really an honour.
But the alumni money really should have gone to Do it.
Say it and let's go home.
What are you waiting for?
I can't.
The change has to come from inside Libby.
- We are inside Libby.
- We won't be forever.
I'd just be manipulating her.
We can't change her for good unless she wants to change.
I know it's hard to do the right thing, Libby, but we're with you.
Libby, you were about to make a grand and generous gesture.
I don't think so.
Okay.
I know you're sad that you can't change Libby, but I have worse news.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Let's make the girl sneeze.
I have an idea.
I'm betting that this leads to the sinuses.
And I hope that leads to a point.
Well, if we can just put an irritant into the sinuses, maybe we can make Libby sneeze.
And since many people are allergic to No!
As your queen, I promise to bebeautiful.
No.
Gross, gross, gross.
- She's gonna blow.
- To the ship.
We're out.
We're in the gym.
There goes my knee.
If that's anything like a hairball, he should eat some grass.
- Bring it right up.
- Shh.
I think I swallowed my gum.
Was I chewing gum?
Sabrina, where have you been?
I heard you were boycotting.
No, I just had to bring my cat to Libby's brain.
I mean the vet.
Gotta go.
Go away, Willard.
But, Zelda.
Oh, this is sweet.
You are the most annoying man I have ever met in my entire life.
I never want to hear you, see you, or in any way sense you ever again.
Okay.
I am getting the feeling - that you are upset.
- Ugh!
Look.
At least let me give you our anniversary present.
But you already gave me one, remember?
The chocolates?
You gave them to Hilda, and Hilda ga-- - Hilda gave them to me.
- Gotta go.
Be careful with that.
It was on sale.
Can't return it.
Why is everyone looking at me like I'm a weirdo?
I'm telling you, the throne made me do those things.
It's evil.
And it's poorly upholstered.
Take it away.
Well, I guess this means you can have your poetry bash after all.
Libby's the same mean person, but things still worked out.
Well, this is great, because I wrote a new poem.
Oh, and I'd love to hear it.
Popcorn dance--  Single file.
Grab a buddy.
We've never had a fire drill after school.
where the women come and go, talking of early-bird specials at Coco's.
O Westbridge, you tempt me with your soft spring mornings, your grease-saturated clam cakes, your bread-crumb coatings.
Through love's torturous path I have wandered, only to find the happiness I have longed for.
I have laid bare my heart.
Hey.
I saw that.
Good arm, Miss Angelou.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Okay, that hurt.
Sabrina, you're gonna be late for school.
Oh!
Hey.
A promotional cap is not a toy.
Sorry.
It's my stupid hair.
I know what I need: professional help.
You really don't have time-- JosÃ© Eber!
Way to conjure.
Okay, be honest with me.
- Am I too light?
- Hey!
He's here for me.
Excuse me, you just slept funny.
My problems are centuries old.
Yeah, but I have a social life.
I don't know where I am or what's going on, but my fee is $1,000 an hour.
Shake your head, darling.
Can you see my roots?
And I thought I looked pert before.
Nothing like a run in the morning to make you feel alive.
I thought running involved speed.
Why is the cat dressed like a jockey?
Coach.
I'm her coach.
I'm training for a decathlon, and, no, you're not.
Did you know that the world's fastest animal is the cheetah?
Let me share my feline expertise.
You only wanna be my trainer because the Other Realm gives generous stipends to coaches.
And the fame.
Let's not forget the fame.
Either you've had a religious experience, or-- You saw Susie.
I just attended a lecture of hers in the Other Realm.
So uplifting.
That woman is so inspirational.
Because of her, I stopped killing for sport.
Well, she sounds like a saint.
Who is she?
Your no-good Uncle Clyde's illegitimate daughter.
And she's coming to visit you this Friday to tell you about the family secret.
- Great.
- What's the matter?
All this talk about Susie has me depressed.
Susie can make anyone feel inadequate.
Not that.
No one mentioned my cute hair.
Hey, Harvey.
Whoa!
You're-- That-- Picked it out myself.
Have you lost your sight?
No.
Since my mom's been pregnant, she's been too busy to shop for me, so I got to buy my whole winter wardrobe alone.
You mean there's more?
Cool.
Oh, what's that?
Oh, the chamber of commerce is publishing a brochure to attract tourists.
They're looking to hire an attractive, fun young couple for the cover.
- The mister and I are going to try out.
- Really?
I tell you, Salinas, you'd swear he was John Travolta.
If he were taller and had hair.
Okay, maybe he should also lose the pockmarks.
We should try out.
We're attractive and fun and boil-free.
Please.
We are the best-looking couple.
- I thought you were dating Dan.
- Dan's a blond.
We'd clash.
You know, she's so obsessed with her looks.
Let's prove to her we're cuter.
You're doing that all wrong.
You're right.
I should be hitting a sack full of cat.
You can't be my coach.
- Are you ready?
- For what?
We're going to meet with Susie.
We're gonna shore up the eroding hillsides of Venus with kudzu, remember?
Right.
Darn it, I can't.
- My trainer's making me do sprints.
- Really?
Well, I'm glad to see the two of you have come to an agreement.
Susie's helping me realise how important it is to have harmony in the family.
You break another promise, I'll kill you.
Thank you, Hilda.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You'll never regret this decision.
You're welcome.
Now run till you bleed!
Hey, you ready to go to the modelling audition?
Another of your winter outfits?
So trying hard didn't make a difference?
You know, funny thing, I went shopping at a swap meet and I picked up a bag of cool guy clothes.
Um, why don't you go try them on.
It's like taking a trip to the mall without leaving the house.
Okay, but it's gonna make me want one of those huge cinnamon things.
Fashionable yet affordable.
Wow.
I've never seen a more brochure-looking outfit.
Not only that, the pants don't itch.
Surprise.
Ooh.
Nice Zamboni.
Say hello to the Domin-A-Tron.
Straight from the Other Realm.
It's all ours, pending 48 more payments.
Don't tell me.
When I'm not using it, it'll fit under my bed.
Just press the start button.
Somebody's been reading the instructions.
DOMIN-A- Level-one workout activated.
Oh, no.
You got a talking one.
If you need me, I'll be right over here, carbo-loading.
"Famine, pestilence, war".
War.
I like it.
When did you become a Republican?
Susie's been encouraging me to invent something that will truly benefit mankind.
And what are you doing after lunch?
I can't decide whether to wipe out disease or hunger, or maybe take a bite out of crime.
Hello.
This is she.
That's great.
Thank you!
Harvey and I just won the cutest-couple contest for the Westbridge brochure.
That's nice, sweetie.
You must be so excited.
It's no big deal.
I'm just doing my part to help the community.
Oh, speaking of helping, Susie will be here soon.
I'm the best.
Oh, yes, Kate Moss, eat your heart out.
Oh, that's right, you don't eat.
I can't make it.
Salem, a few words of encouragement, please?
Didn't work.
I'm stopping.
Do not quit.
You can do it.
Maybe I can.
Workout complete.
You're a winner.
You're a winner.
Huh?
Was someone complimenting me?
I've gotta get going.
Cousin Susie will be here any minute.
See you later, big guy.
Excellent workout.
You are a lovely lady.
I like this machine.
It's so honest.
Yes!
I'll get all the glory with none of the work.
Heh-heh-heh.
By the way, cat, I am going to be the new coach.
The fame will be mine, and I will crush anyone that gets in my way.
It's alive!
The Domin-A-Tron is alive, and it doesn't like me.
Oh, you are just jealous because I like it better than you.
It's a machine.
It's not alive.
Well, I guess it's possible that I'm wrong, if you pushed a "threaten the cat" button.
I wonder what's taking cousin Susie so long?
She probably stopped to heal the sick.
So she'll wanna wash her hands when she gets here.
- Cousin Susie.
Hello, all.
What'd you bring me?
- Cousin Susie, I've heard so much-- Whoa!
Sit by me, dear.
I want to apologise for being so late.
I stopped to deliver a cauldron of chicken soup to my neighbour.
The old lady that lives in the shoe.
Yes.
She's very lonely now that all her children have grown.
- They don't visit.
- Where are they supposed to stay?
She turned the toe into a sewing room.
Well, I try not to judge.
Oh, cousin Susie, you are goodness personified.
- Oh, please.
Can't you see it?
Sure.
Let's talk about the family secret.
Oh, I really don't have time right now.
Um, I've gotta write a term paper on the history of term papers.
- I think it's for extra credit.
- Oh.
Harvey, I'm sure whatever you wear will be just fine.
No, not plaid.
Gotta go.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Oh, well, actually I was just about to take a shower.
Well, we didn't get a chance to talk earlier, and I noticed you were a little uncomfortable.
Oh!
I've gotta remember fabric softener when I wash my underwear.
Sabrina, do you have a problem with the way I look?
No, you're a very nice wart-- Woman!
Beauty is very important to you, isn't it?
No.
I'm just not looking at you because I'm being coy.
But looks are fleeting.
Someday you'll learn that.
Maybe sooner than you think.
What do you mean by that?
Older witches are supposed to teach things to younger witches.
- How to crochet?
- Don't worry.
You'll see.
Time for my pre-breakfast meal.
I am your leader.
All appliances will obey my every command.
Now I know why he was on sale.
Help!
Sabrina, it's horrible.
Just horrible.
Oh, no.
Is it my face?
Oh, good.
Cousin Susie didn't do anything to me.
But-- But the appliances are taking over the house.
No one is safe.
No one!
Salem, no more sardines and Mystery Science Theater before bedtime for you.
- Whoa!
- It was really great how I fooled you into thinking I wanted to win that brochure contest.
Yeah.
Who'd wanna be on a cover where thousands of people will see and admire you?
Get away from me, Sasquatch.
I guess cousin Susie was just trying to scare me.
Hi, Sabrina.
- Oh, hey, Harvey.
Whoa.
Harvey, your face!
Yeah, I know.
My dad's sending me to an endocrinologist.
Well, on the bright side, your clothes look good.
Cousin Susie, who's so cutesy Please come and help Harvey Out of this hair doozy Okay, I got your point.
I put too much emphasis on appearances, and now my boyfriend's ugly.
I learned an important lesson.
Now, please make Harvey cute again.
Only you can fix him, Sabrina.
Not with all the Nair in New England.
When you've truly learned your lesson, he'll change back.
Cookie?
But just one.
Maybe I've had enough.
According to this heart monitor, I'm dead.
Remember the decathlon.
You can take home the gold.
I don't know why Salem despises this machine.
I'm gonna write a strongly worded letter to the Sunbeam Corporation.
Salem!
I have just had a major breakthrough.
Using deionisation and a smidge of hantavirus, I have discovered a process for converting an everyday substance into an edible protein.
Oh, cousin Susie is gonna be so proud of me.
Okay, I'm not imagining this.
So, uh, what did the nurse say?
Well, after she stopped screaming, she told me I should see an orthopaedic doctor for the hump and a dentist for my teeth.
Then she gave me this book on hygiene and asked me to leave.
Same thing she did when I got acid in my eye.
Cousin Susie's done a horrible, hideous, gross thing to Harvey.
Don't speak that way about cousin Susie.
She's the best person in the whole world.
Right now she's feeding homeless witches.
But Harvey's growing hair and turning into a beast.
He's a 17-year-old boy.
- Sounds like he's right on track.
- But he's growing a giant wart-- I don't have time to talk about this right now.
I am almost finished with this portable machine that will turn dirt into food.
It's going to ease the suffering of millions.
Fine.
Easy to see where your priorities lie.
Someone should cross-reference this thing.
- What are you doing?
- Hiding.
You didn't happen to see a rogue iron out there, did you?
Poor Harvey.
He's been pregnant, turned into a bowling pin, a frog Hey, wait.
When he was a frog, I kissed him and that broke the spell.
If I kiss him, that'll prove to cousin Susie that I don't have a problem with the way he looks.
Gotta go.
Don't tell the food processor you saw me.
I've gotta rest.
Stop.
You can do it.
No, really.
I'm in pain, and Judge Judy is on.
Become a winner.
There must be a glitch.
Ow!
I'll tell you when you can take a break, sister.
Now, work.
I must have set this thing on tough love.
Nope.
Still tastes like dirt.
You exercise like a girl.
I am a girl!
And now, thanks to you, I'm in pretty good shape.
Ow!
You know, for a cold metal machine, you're pretty heartless.
I'm finding Salem.
I can't let go!
I control everything in the house.
You can let go after you've given me 50 reps.
Seven.
Eight  - Harvey?
- Yeah, it's me.
- Whoa.
- I know.
My mom just made an appointment with the veterinarian.
Oh, well, if they say anything about emptying a faecal gland, run.
I can't really stay.
I just came by for a kiss.
Really?
Okay.
Nothing!
Kumbaya, my Lord Okay, what gives?
I mean, I've proven that looks don't matter to me.
I kissed that beast.
Well, Sabrina, some lessons aren't that easy to learn.
Believe me, that wasn't easy.
I still got the whisker burns.
Please, I need a hint.
Sorry.
Fine.
If you take pity on me, I'll be at the Slicery, trying to wash down a hairball.
- What are you doing?
- Apparently, working my biceps.
Have fun.
Help me out!
Hey, Sabrina.
What are you doing here?
I was running through the woods and I got hungry.
Thanks for sitting with me.
I know it's hard with all these people staring.
Yeah.
They are staring.
But I'm sitting here with you.
Obviously, I don't care what you look like, because here I am with you, looking like you do.
Lesson learned.
Who are you talking to?
Obviously, no one.
Oh, shoot, I got pizza in my fur.
I'd better get it out before it knots.
I wonder if there's a watering hole nearby.
Did I just say "watering hole"?
Hi.
Can I get you something?
Yeah, can I get, uh--?
Uh - A soda?
- Yeah.
And a soda.
- I'm Jake.
- Sabrina.
So I saw you were with that guy who's outside going through the Dumpster.
Someone said he's your boyfriend.
Actually, we're just friends.
Actually, he's a friend of a friend.
Stop!
Let me stop!
Wuss.
Weakling.
Mama's girl.
Salem, do something!
Unplug him!
I can't.
I'm scared.
Just remember this: this machine does not know where we hide the treats.
Domin-A-Tron, you've met your match.
I'll just go get him.
Finally, the machine that will save the world is built.
Maybe that's what I'll call it.
Must chew through wires.
Must save Hilda.
Mmm, not bad.
Oh, yes!
Oh, no!
It was okay for me to flirt with Jake.
Don't look at me that way.
It was the normal teenage thing to do.
And it has nothing to do with the fact that Jake's so cute and Harvey's so repulsive.
For your information, mister, I would like Jake even if he did look like Harvey used to look.
You know, leave me alone, I gotta get some homework done.
Oh, what's with the electricity in this house?
It's a long story.
Got any lip balm?
Legs won't stop cramping.
I'm never gonna compete in the decathlon.
I guess it's safe now to tell you, I was gonna bet against you.
Aw, sorry about your machine, Zellie.
Oh, that's okay.
Susie pointed out to me that hungry Third World families often don't have a lot of electricity.
Harvey.
I just stopped by to thank you.
You've been really supportive of me during my transformation to hideous man-beast.
Oh, and I wanted to give you this.
Oh, it's a rock shaped like a heart.
That's so sweet.
I carved it myself with my bare hands.
I love it.
Well Do you wanna come in and hang out?
I can't remember when I've had such a good time.
Yeah, I know.
Maybe I shouldn't have bitten Mrs. Popowski.
Oh, you didn't break the skin.
But what was everyone staring at?
I mean, do I have something in my teeth you didn't tell me about?
I think they were staring at me.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Well, I'm gonna go wash my paws.
That's the problem when your knuckles drag.
Hi, Sabrina.
I hope this isn't too forward, but I was in the neighbourhood-- Jake, remember the other day when you asked if the guy in the Dumpster was my boyfriend?
- Yes.
- Well, I really should have said yes.
He is my boyfriend.
He's the best boyfriend I could ever ask for.
You've finally learned your lesson.
That's great!
What was it?
Well, when you stopped caring about looks, you enjoyed Harvey for the person he is.
You learned that true beauty is on the inside.
Wow, I really did learn something.
Cool.
Although, no one should turn down orthodontia.
Wow.
What kind of soap do you use?
ALL : Kumbaya, my Lord Kumbaya You know, I'm used to her looks and I'm even starting to like the song.
That makes you and Susie.
This has been a wonderful visit.
But before I leave, I have something for you, Sabrina.
A whip?
Well, it's a little late.
Harvey's not a beast anymore.
This is a clue to the family secret.
Oh, this clears it up.
And here's another clue: We all have good and bad parts.
These clues are kind of confusing.
I'm getting depressed again.
Wait a minute.
ALL : Kumbaya, my Lord Better.
Just the cat.
Kumbaya, my Lord Kumbaya So the doctor said it was just hormones.
But now that I'm back to normal, my dad's refusing to give the money back to Hard Copy.
I'm sorry we had to miss the photo shoot.
That's all right.
I'm okay with the couple who won.
It meant a lot to them.
As the official representative of the town of Westbridge, I just want to say thank you.
And restrooms are for patrons only.
Daddy, we have to move.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I'm never gonna get these useless lights untangled.
Those lights aren't useless, Sabrina.
They probably grew up underprivileged and never got a decent education.
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas.
Is everyone feeling jolly?
I'm just gonna chop them up into little pieces, and leave them in a suitcase by the highway.
I'm going to broaden my definition of jolly, and take that as a yes.
Well, the lawn is fully decorated and awash in lights.
I even put red noses on the flamingos.
- That is a pretty stupid outfit.
- Oh, yeah?
Watch this.
So it's true.
Taste does skip a generation.
Sabrina, why aren't you wearing the candy-cane outfit that I got you?
Self-respect.
Ooh, that's it.
I'm giving these lights the finger.
There.
Oh, Sabrina, you didn't have to use magic.
The point of Christmas isn't to have things perfect.
It's to spend time with your family.
And frustration and cursing are just part of the joy.
- Uh-oh.
Circuit overload.
Uh-huh.
- Who's the stupid one now?
- Still you.
Wanna play some reindeer games?
Look, the new '99 snowboards are sleeker, sturdier and faster than ever.
We know you want a snowboard, Salem.
And the threatening letters are not helping your case.
Love this line, "Makes a perfect Christmas gift".
Man, that's good writing.
Wasn't the lawn, the roof, the living room enough?
I mean, does our garbage disposal really have to be festive?
Sabrina, you are a regular Charlie I-Hate-Christmas this year.
- What gives?
- I like Christmas.
It's the constant need for family fun that's bringing me down.
Come on, get in the spirit.
Look at all those lights up there.
People are in the holiday spirit all over the world.
Look, there's our house, the brightest one of all.
I knew the all-neon Nativity scene would put us over the top.
Unfortunately, truckers keep stopping here for gas.
It's an invitation to a Christmas Eve party.
Wow, it's at The Cauldron, the hippest, most exclusive club in the Other Realm.
But Christmas Eve is the night we have our family dinner.
And that differs from every other night how?
We use the good china.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
This is my mom.
She came all the way from Terre Haute to spend Christmas with me.
And in honour of her visit, I'm cancelling all tests today.
- Hey.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
- Yeah, if you're into hyperbole.
- What's wrong?
Why is everyone so darn happy?
Well, my mom's morning sickness is over, which means we'll be allowed to have gravy at Christmas.
Ooh, the whole family sitting around the table, slurping up thickened turkey drippings.
That sure says Christmas to me.
- I know.
- Hey, and guess what.
My aunt just hired me at her boutique, and so far I don't stink.
Ever heard of nepotism?
Jeez, Sabrina, you're being a real Charlie Downer.
Hey, this'll cheer you up.
Fred Exley just invited us to his Christmas party.
I could use a night away from my aunts.
We must have done everything Christmassy by now.
But you promised us that tonight you'd come a-carolling.
- But I'd really rather go a-partying.
- But you promised.
Fine, I'll go don my gay apparel.
Is it just me, or have we been stringing popcorn for hours and getting nowhere?
Salem.
I'm only eating the popcorn because it helps me get the string down.
- Well, what song shall we start with?
- Anything dirge-like.
'Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Aah!
- What are you guys doing here?
- This is where the party is.
And we all came outside to make fun of the carolers, but now that we see it's you Help me out here, Valerie.
They're making snowballs out back.
Run.
We'll try and hold them off.
We'll tell them you're lepers.
Go.
- A party?
What fun.
- I bet they've got wassail.
No, no.
We don't have time.
I have to get to reconstructive surgery.
You know what?
I don't think she's getting any better.
We've just got to double our efforts.
It's Christmas Eve.
Everyone is out.
Time to see if there's a snowboard for Salem.
This could be it.
Great.
No snowboard.
Huh?
But that's kind of snowboardy-shaped.
Um, uh Hurry.
We've been terrorised by the unwrapping bandit.
I must go call the police.
Salem unwrap his presents again?
You expected this year to be different?
Wasn't that genius?
The music.
The costumes.
The spectacle.
It was sublime.
Didn't you think so, Sabrina?
Maybe I'm a little too old for Rugrats on Ice.
- Triple our efforts?
- I vote for giving up.
What's this?
Some delivery guy from the Other Realm dropped it off.
I didn't pay attention because it had nothing to do with things that go fast in snow.
Yo, what's up?
There's a Christmas Eve party In the Other Realm There's some cool party people Who are at the helm You're sitting in the house And it's already started You was invited, girl Why ain't you departed?
- Peace.
- Oh, man.
The Other Realm Christmas Eve party.
If only I could get a little downtime from my aunts.
But I know they'll say no.
- Yes.
- Really?
Sabrina, we've done everything we can think of to put you in the holiday spirit.
If you don't wanna eat Christmas Eve dinner with us, then you should go.
She could have said goodbye.
- This is a private party.
- I'm Sabrina Spellman.
I was invited.
Really?
I don't see your name on this list.
Trying to zap our name on this list, are we?
You are so bridge-and-tunnel.
Take her away.
- But - Wait.
I invited her.
You invited her?
Well, Harrison, if you say she's cool She's very cool.
It's your job to know who's cool.
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
I didn't mean to I mean, I thought that If only I had I mean  I'm Harrison.
I organise the exclusive theme parties here at The Cauldron Club.
Oh, I love this place.
Finally no red and green.
You're exactly the kind of person we wanted at this party.
Wait a minute, this isn't about selling Herbalife, is it?
No, no, you're here because you hate all that family Christmas stuff, and so does everyone else we invited.
Well, I don't hate it all.
The presents are nice.
Here, take a shot.
Ooh!
I got him right in the eye.
When you hit the other eye, it actually bleeds.
- How about that?
A reindeer piÃ±ata?
PIÃ Oh, my spine.
Tell Blitzen I love him.
No, not the nose.
- Oh, that just seems wrong.
- I knew you'd like it.
Come over here.
It's a satellite feed of families in the mortal realm celebrating Christmas Eve at this very moment.
It's priceless stuff.
Well, I'm really not into all this.
I mean, you know, not all traditions are bad.
For example, I like the tradition of not doing this stuff.
Look at these two broads.
Have you ever seen anything more pathetic?
Let's make it more pathetic.
SABRINA'S  Aunt Hilda?
Aunt Zelda?
- It's Sabrina.
- She's come home for Christmas.
Oh.
It's just the wind.
Those are my aunts.
And none of you are worthy to gaze upon them, you hipper-than-thou, tragically trendy, irony-addicted, snide, smirking, jaded jerks.
- Give me that.
- Not the remote.
You're not nearly as cool as I thought you were.
Well, I consider that a huge compliment.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my "pathetic" Christmas.
How could you let Sabrina in here?
Your job is to keep the uncool people out.
But you said And then I thought And then  Aunt Hilda.
Aunt Zelda.
I've finally decided after all that-- MAN : With our contestants on-stage.
What we're looking for is What happened to all the decorations?
- And your holiday dinner?
- Holiday?
What holiday?
- Christmas?
- Christmas?
What's Christmas?
I get it.
You guys zapped away all the decorations to make a point.
Okay, I've learned my lesson.
Now, let's go have our traditional Christmas Eve dinner, and watch It's a Wonderful Life.
What is that?
One of those new teen-slasher movies?
Sabrina, you can't stay up late and watch TV.
- It's a school night.
- But tomorrow's December 25th.
I know, the start of midterms.
Oh, man, you guys aren't joking, are you?
Come on, Christmas?
Santa Claus?
Reindeer?
Little drummer boys?
If you're trying to convince us that you have a fever, it's not working.
Most delusions are more coherent.
I admit we could all use a break, but luckily summer vacation is only seven months away.
And you need your rest.
Good night, Sabrina.
Good night.
And merry Christmas.
Christmas?
Do you think she's spending too much time on the Internet?
Sabrina, what happened to Christmas?
Salem, you remember?
Whatever spell you've enacted doesn't affect witch familiars.
- I enacted?
- I'm guessing you must have done something at that party in the Other Realm.
All I did was turn off the TV and storm out.
That wouldn't do anything.
Unless you used the remote and hit the erase button.
I did use the remote and I might have hit erase.
Oh, no.
It's gone.
You've erased Christmas.
It was my favourite gift-getting holiday.
Wait a minute.
We're jumping to conclusions.
I mean, maybe I didn't erase Christmas for the whole world.
Let's check.
Do you think maybe in a minute, the lights will go on, and the whole world will yell "gotcha"?
Sabrina, if you don't reverse the spell in 24 hours, Christmas will be erased permanently.
- How do you know that?
- Years ago, I was at a party in the Other Realm and I erased Bobunk.
- I've never heard of it.
- That's my point.
I never did figure out how to reverse the spell, and Bobunk was gone forever.
Ah, the days of Bobunk.
Salem, I've got to find a way to bring the spirit of Christmas back.
Maybe if I start doing Christmassy things, people will start to remember.
- That didn't work with Bobunk.
- Stop saying Bobunk.
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, that again.
I'm sorry, I'm not up on the current hip lingo.
I made you breakfast.
We've got delicious Christmas food.
Here.
Some eggnog, a candy cane.
Give it a try.
Oh!
Oh, that is disgusting.
Who ever heard of drinking an egg?
- Aah!
Oh, I think I chipped my tooth.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
Feliz Navidad.
Merry December 25th, everyone.
Hey, guys.
There you go.
What's this for?
It's December 25th, a day to celebrate and feel merry, right?
Are you kidding me?
My aunt just fired me from her store.
She said it's her slow time of the year.
Now what am I gonna do for money?
Thanks, Sabrina.
Hey, I'll sell you this for 5 bucks.
No, thanks.
My allowance got cut, because my dad's exterminating business isn't doing well.
Nobody has parties this time of year, so people don't care if their homes are riddled with insects.
- Oh, Mrs. Quick, I got you a present.
- Don't try and butter me up, Sabrina.
We're having that midterm today.
It'll do my heart good to watch the weaker brains explode in a flashy, fiery eruption.
Mrs. Quick, this isn't like you.
Oh, you try working September to June without a break!
I miss my family.
Would a tie cheer you up?
Silent night, holy night  Sabrina?
Stop that.
We need complete silence.
Well, that's why I thought "Silent Night" would be appropriate.
- Never heard of that song.
- Is it on the new CÃ©line Dion album?
Please be quiet, and get back to your tests.
Open up.
We want lunch.
In the name of all that is greasy and deep-fried, open this door.
Ah.
If Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol doesn't jog people's memories, nothing will.
Scrooge.
Ebenezer Scrooge.
I am your partner, Jacob Marley.
You'll be visited by three ghosts.
See, this is because she's hungry.
Why would somebody cut down a perfectly good tree, and bring it indoors?
Bah!
Humbug.
Please go away.
God bless us, everyone.
Sabrina, I'm afraid you're suspended until the proper mental-health professionals have been contacted.
But no one's had their Christmas goose.
Anybody wanna sit on my lap?
It could bring back a beloved holiday.
Hey, little girl, wanna sit on my lap?
You could tell me all the presents you want.
Come on, sit on my lap.
Come on, how could it hurt?
Sit on my lap.
- I said sit on my freaking lap.
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy.
Oh, I can explain.
See, she was-- And it's because I--  Is this your niece?
- I'm not sure.
- She was at Grafton's store causing a major disturbance.
I was gonna arrest her, but I decided to bring her here, and put her in your custody.
Because you're so full of the holiday spirit?
She's talking crazy.
Merry this, happy that.
If I were you, I'd check her urine.
- Time's running out.
I feel terrible.
- You?
Did you see the size of that snowboard?
I've gotta find someone, anyone in this world, who remembers Christmas.
How about Father Christmas?
- Is he real?
- As real as actual Christmas.
I guess right now that's not such a good example.
See if he's in the Witch pink pages.
He's listed.
You're lucky.
There was no Father Bobunk.
- Father Christmas?
- Hm?
I'm Sabrina Spellman, the girl who erased Christmas.
- Please don't be mad.
- Ho!
Mad?
My dear girl, thanks to you, we're having our very first real family vacation.
My wife, Mumsy Christmas, and the little tykes, our grandchildren: Binky, Bunny, Boopsie, Winnie, Minnie, Mopsy, and Fred.
Isn't Christmas important?
But so is spending time with your family, eh?
Look how many fish I've caught, eh?
After a time one does get used to the smell.
But couldn't you help me get Christmas back?
I mean, as a favour?
I didn't wanna mention this, but my country did save your butt during World War II.
I am afraid I can't help you, Sabrina.
Only you can undo what you've done.
- Thanks, anyway.
- Mm-hm.
Ta-ta.
And I'd put some sun block on these pasty kids.
No Christmas.
No hope for mankind, and you didn't even bring me a fish?
It's 11:00.
Christmas is almost gone for good.
Maybe now Arbor Day will come into its own.
We're going to the pharmacy.
It's the perfect time of year to wait in a prescription line.
It's snowing really fiercely out there.
Conditions are hazardous and life-threatening.
Pick me up a NutRageous bar, okay?
Salem's right.
It's really coming down out there.
Well, I suppose I can wait another day to get my face cream.
No comments from the peanut gallery.
Honey, are you okay?
We've been worried about you.
I've been realising that there are things you don't miss until they're gone.
Like a snowboard.
- Hey.
- Ooh.
Someone's gonna end up crying.
Probably me.
I'm starving.
Last one to the kitchen makes the sandwiches.
You're last.
- No, you're last.
- Let's ask the judges.
You're both last.
Fine, Aunt Hilda and I will both make the sandwiches.
I'll take tuna.
Hey.
Ladies, not again.
- Yes!
Dive.
Dive.
Oh.
I'm still hungry.
Fine.
You guys clean up, and I'll make the sandwiches.
Done.
Thanks.
Now, you guys go wait in the dining room.
You know what?
I'm glad we got snowed in.
Me too.
I'm pretty sure I ruptured something, but, yeah, it was fun.
You know, Salem, Father Christmas was right.
All the hoopla of Christmas isn't as important as spending time with your family.
Sabrina, you're back.
You decided to spend Christmas Eve with us after all.
- That's so wonderful.
- It's not Christmas Eve.
Christmas.
You said Christmas.
Come on, Salem.
The tree, it's here.
Oh, and the decorations.
They're incredible.
I'm so happy Christmas didn't suffer the fate of Bobunk.
What's Bobunk?
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.
We thought we'd stop by and give you your presents so we could get back to our families.
Mom's letting us have coffee too.
And it's rumoured that my parents have branched out from the traditional pyjama-and-underwear gifts.
Why are you smiling so much?
Because Because Because Harvey's under the mistletoe.
- Anybody want some eggnog?
- Me.
I love eggnog.
This is great.
All the people I love most in the world together under one beautifully overdecorated roof.
Well, I think this calls for a toast.
To family.
To friends.
To Christmas.
It's back and better than ever.
Hey, this one's from Father Christmas.
Oh, cousin Kris sent you a present.
How thoughtful.
- We're related to him?
Distantly.
You kind of forget about it until he needs money.
Robert E. Lee.
Must be a clue to the family secret.
I can never get enough of these.
"Dear Sabrina, thanks for the vacation.
Once Christmas returned, I knew you figured out what I was trying to tell you about family.
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Joyous Bobunk".
- Speaking of Bobunk, where's Salem?
Sabrina, stop this crazy thing.
Oh!
My spine.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hey, Salem, when did you start painting?
When no one would read my screenplay.
I need a creative outlet.
Well, my background in this area is pretty much limited to spin art, but I like what I see.
Well, let's not forget my model.
She deserves some of the credit.
Do you mind if I put my nose back?
I've gotta sneeze.
For your safety, please watch the following video.
Oh, you can read a magazine, but you didn't have time to read my screenplay.
I got through volumes one and two, but then it seemed to drift.
This is Enchanted By, the magazine for witches.
Anything in there about dating mortals?
You'll do anything to work the fact that you're dating into the conversation.
That's not true.
Has anyone seen my book bag?
The guy I'm dating has books.
Sabrina, I want you to check out this month's Enchanted By.
There happen to be some very edifying articles.
"Nose Warts: How to Hide Them".
Oh, good, it's got pictures.
The guy I'm dating has a nose.
Okay, I'll stop.
I want you to read the bulletin from the Witches' Council.
They're advising witches under the age of 21 to refrain from charitable magic.
Whew, relieved of the burden of helping others.
Charitable magic can have disastrous long-term consequences.
For instance, the teenage witch in Ohio who zapped away her best friend's acne.
- How thoughtful.
- Seemed that way, but as it turns out, her best friend was destined to one day discover a cure for acne.
So now, no cure.
And now, instead of being a scientist, she'll be a smooth-faced wino.
I'll add that to my list of 10,000 other witch rules I'm supposed to follow.
Would you mind terribly if I asked for that in a crystal bowl?
As an artist, I'm sensitive about these things.
Allow me.
Sabrina, that was charitable.
You didn't listen to a word I said.
Oh, come on.
Salem's not gonna accomplish anything in his life.
I'm still way ahead of half the Kennedy children.
Harvey, you're gonna be late for Chemistry.
What are you doing?
Trying to open my locker.
You think my gym shoes could be causing a vacuum?
I know I'm not supposed to do this, but I doubt there's a Nobel Prize in Harvey's future.
Whoa, somebody's been working out.
Sabrina, I've gotta ask you something.
If it's about your hair, yes, it does look like a woodland creature's home.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I didn't really have time to fix it this morning.
You know, Libby, speaking of hair, how's your chronic lice problem?
I mean, you should be charging those little fellows rent.
That was great, Sabrina.
Look, I hate to put you in the position of having to say no, but my mom's always on me about having a friend over for dinner, and I've been putting it off for 13 years, but she's like a dog with a bone.
Val, stop being so insecure.
- I'd love to come over.
- Really?
Tonight is charades night at the Birkhead house.
Sounds like fun, and it beats "throw out the fuzzy food" night at my house.
You know, painting has opened up a whole new world for me.
My soul is soaring.
Now, how can I use this God-given talent for material gain?
I know.
All I need is a human.
Close enough.
It smells like turpentine in here.
Did you order from that sushi place again?
Do me a favour and take these paintings down to that hip new gallery in town.
You know, the one with all the driftwood art.
I can't.
Brock's picking me up for our date any minute.
Besides, no gallery would ever buy paintings done by a cat.
How about if you're the painter?
We'll split the commission right down the middle: Eighty-20.
But I don't like your paintings.
They're creepy.
Why don't you paint something pretty on velvet?
Hilda, Brock's here.
Who ordered sushi?
- Hi, Hilda.
- Hi.
Say, who's the artist in the family?
These paintings are remarkable.
Oh, it's really just a hobby.
Oh, yeah.
So you see, Sabrina, being a safety inspector boils down to this: people pay me to do their worrying for them.
Do you get a bonus for panicking?
By the way, Warren, I picked this up for you on the way home.
- Great bicycle helmet.
- Oh, no.
We wear them in the car.
Twenty bucks to keep that information inside these walls.
Have some chopped beets, Sabrina.
Mom's a nutritionist.
Everything we eat is healthy.
I never said being my friend would be easy.
Don't worry.
I can make almost anything disappear.
What a beautiful shade of red.
I could use that colour to create a masterpiece.
No, I'll just eat it.
Twenty-six, 27, 28.
Now you may swallow.
Hey, look, a wishbone.
I once choked on a ham bone.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
Why don't you and Mr. Birkhead make a wish?
No, thank you.
We're not the whimsical sort.
Come on.
Live a little.
Well, all right, then.
But everyone shield your eyes, there may be bone shards.
I guess this is sort of charity, but I'm so bored.
Make a good wish.
Their lives are so dry Here's what we'll do Take whatever they wish And make it come true Ah.
Okay, who wants, or is willing to try, rhubarb pie?
Yummy.
Looks like pie.
I--  Smells terrible.
Bad colours.
I don't-- I won't eat this.
I refuse to eat--  Strong.
- Round.
- Round.
Oh, I've got it.
The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.
Wow.
I couldn't even get Little Women.
I'm such a loser.
Okay, that makes the final charades score: Sabrina, 18.
Everyone else, two.
Well, I really gotta get going.
I'm really tired and no wonder.
It's 8:15.
This is the latest anyone has ever stayed, including blood relatives.
Thank you.
It was nice to see you, Sabrina.
Dinner was terrific and thanks for the recipe.
That lima bean loaf really did taste like tofu.
Leave before she tries to put some in a sack.
Gotta go.
You really livened up our evening, Sabrina.
In fact, that's what I wished for.
That our Valerie would be happier and more upbeat like you.
A happier Valerie.
What could be wrong with that?
So, what happened at the gallery?
- They bought all the paintings.
- Yes.
And they wanna have an exhibition of your work.
I mean, our work.
I mean, my work.
Don't you wanna hear about my date?
No.
Let's see the money.
Here.
Why did you want it all in singles?
So I can do this: I'm rich!
Rich, I tell you!
Salem, it's only a few hundred dollars.
I'm well-off!
Well-off I tell you!
Hey, Sabrina, that was really fun last night.
For the first time in years I didn't have my "naked in the Superdome" dream.
I'm glad you're in a good mood.
Yeah, I just feel different for some reason.
I'd like to thank the two of you for always travelling together.
It helps me insult you that much more efficiently.
Libby, better run along.
Aren't you late for your-- "Future Bitter DivorcÃ©es of America" meeting?
My worst nightmare: freaks in Sensurround.
That felt great.
Well, better get to Algebra II.
She is more upbeat.
Man, I'm good.
"A 25-foot ladder is leaning against a garage.
Its base is 12 feet from the wall.
How high up does the ladder reach"?
Oh, I know.
The ladder is-- Why, Valerie, that's another one right.
Either you've been studying, or have I been mouthing the answers again?
No, Valerie's just becoming more like a person that's good in math.
So have you noticed anything different about Valerie lately?
Now that you mention it, she seems a lot more happy and relaxed, like you.
Oh, well, you mean that she reminds you of me, right?
Not that she's actually becoming like me.
Guys don't struggle with issues like that.
- Valerie, wait.
- I can't.
I signed up to help with Spanish tutoring.
Me too.
Since when do you speak Spanish?
That's Spanish, you know.
- Valerie-- - Sabrina-- - You first.
- I just-- - Stop!
- Stop!
So weird.
It's like we have the same brain or something.
Man, I'm late.
Gotta go.
- Oh, Sabrina.
- Hi, Mrs. Birkhead.
- I was on my way to Science Club-- - Valerie said she's gonna join that.
Oh, well, there's a surprise.
Anyway, I was just wondering about the wish you made the other night.
Do you remember your exact words?
I said, "I wish our Valerie could be just like Sabrina".
- "Just" like me?
- Uh-huh.
Let me go get Valerie.
Try and stay calm.
It would be so unusual for a spell to backfire on me.
Hey, Sabrina.
And they say no one bats a thousand.
Valerie, your hair looks just like mine.
I was gonna say the same thing to you.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Hey, I could get used to that.
Harvey, did you just do what I think you did?
You mean, kiss Valerie?
But I kiss everyone.
It's my Italian blood.
You're Slovenian.
Hey, I just got off the phone with Brock.
He asked me out on another date.
I'll get in touch with the people at Ripley's.
I really think Brock might be the one.
I mean, there's no posing, there's no pretence.
It's just a totally honest relationship.
So you told him you're a witch?
Of course not.
Oh, by the way, the gallery called.
They wanna pick up some more of my paintings.
Brock's so impressed.
Fine, but I should inform you that my style has evolved.
I now work with found objects.
Old bicycle inner tubes, seashells, bio-waste, and incorporate them into my art.
Sounds awful.
I'm gonna be famous.
Here we go.
"Wishbone Spells.
See Sanders, Colonel.
Page 387".
What?
Salem, there's paint all over the page I need.
- Do you have any idea why?
- I've been cleaning my brushes on it.
I heard that Lichtenstein cleaned his with Perrier and hundred dollar bills.
Thanks a lot.
I granted Mrs. Birkhead's wish that Valerie be like me.
Not just like you.
Would we be having this conversation if I had left it vague?
This is bad.
Pretty soon there'll be two Sabrinas and Valerie will disappear forever.
How can I phrase this in a way that will capture the spirit of the moment?
Help.
Here's what you do: move to the Pacific Northwest and live out your days under an assumed name.
I recommend "Agnes".
- Salem, you're useless.
- I'm an artist, not a logician.
There's gotta be a way around this.
Hey.
If Valerie's acting like me, all I have to do is start acting the way she used to act before she started acting like me.
She'll start acting like her old self and stop acting like me.
Get it?
Would this be a bad time to tell you you're sitting on paint?
I have an idea.
Have you ever thought about dying your hair brown?
Like it would make a difference.
I just know I'm gonna flunk next week's history test, the Science Club wants to kick me out, and I'm pretty sure I'm the most unpopular girl in school.
- Really?
Great, it's working.
Well, then I have to cheer you up because life is great and you're great.
Jeez, am I really that obnoxious?
Come to dinner at my house.
I know that my aunts would love to see you.
- Your aunts?
- Oops, I meant parents.
I won't take no for an answer.
See you tonight.
I know this can work, I just have to be twice as insecure.
It's times like this I hate coming from a loving environment.
I just know I'm not gonna get into college, and I'd bet anything Harvey's gonna break up with me, and the economic instability in Russia is really affecting my sleep.
You will get into college, Harvey won't break up with you, and Russia probably will collapse, but we don't live there.
Valerie has taught us so much with her new upbeat attitude.
It's like when I was looking over these plans for a new bridge at work.
I realised when I say, "not safe for humans," I'm like a broken record.
MRS.
Everyone hungry?
We've got fried chicken, onion rings, fatback and crackling.
Mom bought the new Elvis recipe book.
After dinner, can I go run with scissors again?
This is gonna be harder than I thought.
Salem, I've got bad news.
I just got back from the gallery and your latest paintings bombed.
Oh, no.
But the good news is I've still got a date with Brock.
He really likes the way I handle setbacks.
See you.
Fame, you are a fickle mistress.
Well, I still have my art, and that's what's important.
I got into this because I love painting, not to get rich.
Who am I kidding?
I just made a down payment on a mail-order bride.
- Hi, Sabrina.
- Hey.
Hey, Sabrina.
You know, I'm thinking of changing my name to Sabrina.
I mean, after all, it's what everyone calls me.
"Sabrina Birkhead".
No, no, no.
"Sabrina Sirkhead".
Sounds better with something with an S, wouldn't you say?
Is nothing sacred?
Hey, Harvey, what do you say you and I hit the Slicery this afternoon alone.
I know I'll be hungry.
Oh, that does it.
Now it's time to play hardball.
She's not stealing my life or my boyfriend.
Let's see if she still wants to be like me.
Sabrina, has something been bothering you?
Anything with just three chords ain't music.
Believe me, Sabrina, I recognise a cry for help when I see one.
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable speaking with someone your own age who's a little more mature.
I know, Valerie.
Salem, you know, Vincent van Gogh was a great artist, and he never sold a single painting during his lifetime.
Really?
What a loser.
Wonder who that is.
Ooh, maybe it's Brock.
- Who is it?
Delivery for Spellman.
"Rest In Peace".
"Deepest Sympathy".
"Say hi to God for me"?
Be glad you didn't get our biggest seller: "Good Riddance".
Hilda, did you know you're in the newspaper?
Really?
Where?
The obituary page.
Have you died and not told me?
Either the afterlife is a disappointment of enormous proportions, or somebody owes me an explanation.
Salem?
Look, everyone knows a painter's paintings get more valuable after he dies.
I'm just speeding up the process.
I'm referred to as your "long-time companion".
Everyone is going to think that I'm dead.
What's the big deal?
You don't leave the house that much anyway.
So this is how it ends.
Me with a ring in my nose and no way out of this mess.
Well, at least the spell can't get any worse.
Sabrina, you're not gonna believe this.
I have magical powers.
Watch.
The phrase "spiralling out of control" comes to mind.
Oh, don't worry.
I promise to use them responsibly.
I'd never do anything frivolous with them.
What are you looking at, freaks?
Well, most of the time.
It looks like you don't quite have a handle on that magic of yours.
We better go somewhere and figure out what to do.
You're not gonna turn me over to scientists, - or sell me to the government?
- Oh, of course not.
Not right off the bat, anyway.
I came over as soon as I heard the news, Zelda.
Tell me, how did it happen?
Um Would you excuse me for a moment?
Who do we invite to the wake?
Hilda, Brock's here.
Oh, that's right.
We've got a date.
Not so fast.
He thinks you're dead.
Well, when he sees me, he'll know I'm not.
You can't go in there.
He's not as dumb as he looks.
He'll know you faked your death because your paintings weren't selling.
- I'll tell him they weren't my paintings.
- And he'll know you've been untruthful.
And the beautiful relationship you two had will be tainted by lies and more lies.
Just my luck.
I meet the guy of my dreams, but I die.
I'll let him down gently.
I know it's gotta hurt, Hilda, but you did kind of bring it on yourself.
Wait a minute.
What am I talking to a cat for?
I don't have to tell Brock about the paintings.
I'll tell him the newspaper made a mistake.
Hilda Spelminsky died.
Oh, there, there.
It's okay to cry.
Just use this tissue instead of my blouse.
Oh, sorry.
Hi, Brock.
The newspaper made a mistake.
Brock.
Okay, that's not the way he usually greets me.
Uh, sorry, but Brock said he needed closure so I zapped in some photos of you in a coffin.
I'm so pale.
You're dead.
Okay, stay here and lay off the magic.
And I'll go figure out what to do.
Look, I've been thinking about it and it's gonna be so weird, Sabrina.
I'm gonna have to hide my powers and make up all sorts of excuses for the rest of my life.
You have no idea what kind of stress I'm gonna be under.
Right.
I have no idea.
Have you guys got a minute?
Oh, look, Hilda.
Sabrina's going through that charming "to assert my independence I'm making myself as ugly as possible" phase.
I'll explain later.
I may have gotten in a small problem with charitable magic.
You did?
Didn't you read the advisory by the Witches' Council in my magazine?
It couldn't have been more explicit.
I blame the school system.
My retention's not what it should be.
So now Valerie's a witch.
Not a particularly good one, but still.
All right, Sabrina.
Here's what you have to do to reverse the spell.
First, change your clothes.
There's no reason to make the situation sadder.
Ah.
Then you've got to take Valerie home and somehow convince Mr. and Mrs. Birkhead to say, in these precise words: "We're happy Valerie changed".
- Got it?
- Why do I want them to say that?
I want them to be not happy that Valerie has changed.
We know it's ironic.
We know it's illogical, but believe it or not, we know more about these things than you do.
Fine, okay.
Shouldn't be very hard.
Mr. and Mrs. Birkhead are thrilled with the new Valerie.
What happened?
You guys were so upbeat before.
Remember that bridge I was telling you about?
It's still standing.
Twenty feet below sea level.
I just got fired for recommending a heart patient loosen up and try lard.
Well, what about Warren?
I mean, you seem happy.
I found out the hard way: electrical sockets are not toys.
If you ask me, our troubles started about the time Valerie changed.
Oh, but you're glad she changed, right?
Not at all.
We miss the old Valerie.
But you didn't realise how much until she changed, so you're really glad she changed.
- No.
- I see.
Okay, I know what will liven things up.
Let's play charades.
- Now?
- Now?
I'll go first.
It's not the name of a book or a movie.
It's just a particular phrase, okay?
- Small?
- Tiny?
- Wee?
- Yes.
Okay, "we".
Next word.
Oh, I've got it.
Happy.
Okay, "We're happy--" - Valerie?
- Okay, "We're happy Valerie".
- We're almost done.
- Mom, Dad, I can't keep it a secret any longer.
I've got magical powers.
Watch.
Valerie, you changed Warren into a dingo.
"Changed".
You said "changed".
You said, "We're happy Valerie changed".
Uh, did I just see what I thought I saw?
Of course not.
It's that crackpot diet of yours.
You eat enough pastrami and bear claws, you're gonna start seeing things.
What--?
What happened?
How did I get here?
You seemed to believe you had magical powers, dear.
You tried to change Warren into a dingo.
I did?
I am such a loser.
Oh, our baby, she's back.
That's all?
- Yes.
You've gotta read and chronologically organise all of your aunt Zelda's Enchanted By magazines.
Then we'll consider the matter settled.
And to make sure you actually read and don't skim, there will be a quiz when you're done.
Fine by me.
As a frequent victim of your punishments, I'd say you guys are getting soft.
Whoa.
Did I mention that I've been a loyal Enchanted By subscriber for over 375 years?
Believe it or not, this is nothing compared to the International Male she's got stacked in the basement.
This is child abuse.
Do you know how many paper cuts I could get?
You think you've got it bad?
And I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
La la la la la!
I don't think I've ever seen you so happy.
Me neither.
Which is a really sad commentary on Hilda's life.
Hilda always gets this excited when she's gonna see our cousin Zsa Zsa Goowhiggie.
- Gesundheit.
- She's my favourite relative.
She's a great practical joker.
Tons of fun.
If you call putting killer bees in someone's bonnet "fun".
Oh, well, maybe you were too swollen to laugh.
Well, I'm gonna say my hellos and then get back to work on my subatomic microphone.
Still trying to prove electrons can hear?
- Don't laugh.
- Because they might hear me?
And you, instead of fooling around with Zsa Zsa, you should be practising your violin.
- You've got an audition in two days.
- Which is two days away.
This is vintage Zsa Zsa.
Okay, Zsa Zsa, you can morph into your human form now.
Gotcha.
So.
"Goowhiggie".
Is that Swedish?
Other leprechauns look up to me.
There you go.
When did you start selling cosmetics?
When the trust fund dried up.
Ooh!
Here is the latest beauty product from the Other Realm.
"Instant Hobo"?
What, when the jar's empty, you can live in it?
I think I'm getting bags under my eyes.
Okay, you all missed your cue to say: "No, Salem, you look fine".
That means I need some concealer.
Salem, I'd love to sell you some products, but your name's all over the bad checklist.
- What about my aliases?
- They're gonna have baggy eyes too.
Zelda.
- This colour could be for you.
- Oh?
- Oh!
Oh!
- Ha-ha-ha-ha.
You know, they must miss you two at the Algonquin.
- Whoo!
- I'd love to stick around and wonder what you two have been drinking.
- But I gotta get to school.
- Oh, Sabrina.
Sabrina, please, try this blush.
I wonder what's gonna pop out and cause you two to laugh uncontrollably.
Hmm.
- Hey.
Nice colour.
ZSA  Uh-huh.
Not bad.
- Really.
- Thank you, Zsa Zsa.
- Oh, you're welcome.
Bye-bye.
Hey, Sabrina.
Ho.
Did you enrol in clown college?
Uh!
Zsa Zsa.
Harvest season at my aunts' vineyard.
So did you sign up to take any college-prep classes?
Oh, I decided I'm not taking the SATs.
I'm gonna be a mechanic, so I'm not going to college.
Really?
No college?
What a day.
Who would've thought an executive vice president would have so much to do?
Drive.
So what if your engine's on fire?
What are you, a girl?
- Harvey, I'm home.
- Oh, hey, honey.
Did you see the new car?
Yeah, it looks like it's up on new blocks too.
And as soon as I find an engine and some tyres, I'm taking my girl for a ride.
Oh, it's getting exciting.
See you after class.
Wait, so you're really not gonna go to college?
Nope.
Not even clown college?
Cha-cha-cha-cha.
Aha.
The concealer at last.
Hmm.
That cherry lipstick looks delicious.
No.
Beautify now, eat later.
Do you think I should be worried that Harvey isn't going to college?
- I didn't go to college.
- He's doomed, I tell you.
Doomed.
Oh, I can't imagine what it would feel like to have no drive, so little ambition.
Not that that's a bad thing.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be so driven.
- You never had time for fun.
- I have fun.
Working nonstop to achieve a goal is enormously pleasurable.
Oh, that's right.
They have that new all-work ride at Disneyworld.
May I offer a suggestion?
Walk-a-mile moccasins.
You each buy a pair and then switch.
They help you understand how the other person feels.
Couldn't we just have extensive family therapy?
Maybe we should try them, Hilda.
It's only a mile, and they're pink.
Well, I can see why you'd want to be like me, but why would I want to be like you?
All right.
Ah.
Yes.
Now switch.
Say, everyone, are there still bags under my eyes?
Salem, where are you?
I'm right here, in front-- Oh, dear Lord.
I used too much concealer.
- I'm invisible.
- And in debt.
But on the bright side, you really can't see those bags.
Knock, knock.
Oh, hi, Zsa Zsa.
I don't have any time for any pranks, so just leave the joy buzzer, and I'll shock myself with it later.
This is business, honey.
Now, I overheard about your little friend, Harvey, and I've got the perfect product.
- "Pure Ambition"?
- It's a cologne.
A little dab, and your man will be more ambitious than the entire William Morris mailroom put together.
Whoa, it's a little musky.
Well, they do say that success is 99 percent perspiration.
Gross.
I'll take it.
Put it on my aunts' tab.
I'm telling you, man, this East German transmission's driving me crazy.
I figure it's either a valve or they're plotting to take over the world again.
- Harvey.
I got you a present.
- What for?
Boyfriend's Day.
It's a holiday that the retailers came up with to fill in the slow sale season between Christmas and Easter.
Just put it on.
Ew.
It smells like my dog when he's rolled in something dead.
But I like it.
Hey, after I replace that valve, I think I'm gonna overhaul the whole engine.
You're not talking about SATs, are you?
Come on, man, we can fix this car.
We just need to be a little more ambitious.
After you fix the car, you're gonna drive it to a college-recruitment centre?
Right?
I guess a little dab didn't do him.
We've been wearing these moccasins for a while, and I don't feel any different.
Do you?
No.
Although I do have a sudden urge to track bear.
Hey, Hildie.
Wanna fill up all the holes on the golf course?
No, thanks.
I'm going to practise my violin.
And I have research to do.
Although golf-course high jinks sound like fun.
Ah!
Hey.
Hoo.
Oh, the smell.
It's not that bad, is it?
- Where are you going?
- To bathe.
And to take the practise SAT test.
Ah.
The sweet stench of success.
Ahem.
Hello?
Do you have Prince Albert in a can?
Oh, I think you do.
Excuse me, shopkeeper.
Do be a sport and let me out of here, would you?
Oh, didn't you say that somebody was coming over from the grant committee for a presentation?
Oh, that's right.
- And I've got to get right to work.
- Mm-hm.
- Just one more call.
- One more.
Salem?
SALEM : Salem's not here.
Oh, well, then he won't want me to open any of those cans for him.
Oh.
Wait, here he is now.
Salem, how about some of that sockeye?
SALEM : Love some.
Hey, bright boy.
You might be invisible, but these cans aren't.
- Put these away.
Party pooper.
And put that tongue back in your mouth.
Don't you have some research to do?
- Hildie.
Your nose is running.
- No, it isn't.
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, it is.
I'm just glad I don't play a wind instrument.
So you seem to be working hard.
How do you think you did?
Oh, I forgot about the test.
I was drawing up my design for the new racecar I'm gonna build.
It's completely aerodynamic, and it has 17 cup holders.
I'm gonna get Zsa Zsa right in the Goowhiggie.
That Ambition cologne only made Harvey more ambitious towards cars and beverage caddies.
Well, Harvey's ambition needs to expand beyond his usual horizons.
The cologne may not be enough.
I'm not buying any more stuff.
Well, I'm not sure I have anything that's appropriate, although I did sell the Ambition deodorant to Bill Gates.
But it's not for Harvey.
- Bill Gates?
- Mm-hm.
And Michael Eisner, he swears by Ambition shampoo.
But it's not for Harvey.
Oh, and he wouldn't be interested in the Ambition after-shave.
I'll take the whole line of Ambition products.
Wonderful.
And with your $40 purchase, you'll receive this lovely tote bag.
- Forty dollars?
- Forty dollars.
- Put it on my aunts' tab.
- Mmm.
Ooh.
Ambition is a good product.
Almost as good as my favourite perfume, Reverse Psychology.
Man, these Ambition products are heavy.
- Salem.
I love these free rides.
Although I could've done without your stopover in the bathroom.
Harvey will never put these products on willingly.
Just gonna have to do it the hard way.
Oh, hey.
I'm so glad to see you.
I just came to an incredible decision.
I'm gonna do everything I can to achieve my full potential.
Oh, that's great.
And you're starting out by clearing out your locker?
I'm starting by dropping out of school.
That's not gonna look good on your college application.
Hey, so why are you dropping out of school?
- To be a mechanic?
- Of course not.
I'm gonna pool my lawn-mowing, paper-route money together and put a down payment on a garage.
I'm gonna be an owner-operator.
Great.
So was Goober Pyle.
I am here to interview Zelda Spellman regarding her grant proposal.
I'll go get her.
Zelda is a terrific researcher.
Very hardworking, dedicated, professional.
Zelda.
Zelda.
This is Boris Lermontov, the head of the grant committee.
Oh, Mr. Lermontov.
Please sit down.
- Ahem.
- All the way down.
- Oh.
- I can't find my spectacles.
Here they are.
I'm sorry.
The house isn't level.
I suppose you find time to do actual research between guffaws.
I'm sorry.
I would like to get serious and discuss my latest endeavour, - the wedgie project.
- Aaah!
So it did make the boy ambitious.
If you consider foregoing a high-school diploma to spend time with leaky carburettors ambitious.
- And I do.
- Just tell me how to reverse the effect.
Sorry.
Once Ambition has been applied, you have to let it run its course.
Great.
Well, this is as ambitious as he'll get, right?
Should be.
You just used a little, didn't you?
Harvey?
Let me guess.
You haven't been working on cars, have you?
No.
And I've got great news.
Instead of going to the bank for a loan, I got on the Internet and used my savings to buy yen, which I converted into German marks, and put the whole thing on pork bellies.
And when I left home, I was up $11 million.
Course, it's all on paper.
Eleven million dollars?
Think of the college you could afford.
Good idea.
Maybe I'll buy one.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Salem, stop that.
I'm invisible, and you can't catch me.
I'm invisible, and you can't-- SALEM : You will hear from my lawyer.
God bless Claude Rains.
Well, Boris Lermontov called.
Looks like I'm not getting that grant.
And after that wedgie, he's joining the Vienna Boys Choir.
I hope this teaches you to act more responsibly.
Oh, you're right.
I really need to.
ZSA  Here I come.
Hide.
Zsa Zsa's it.
Cancel my 5:00.
Tell the mayor I can't make his fundraiser, but tell the governor I can make his.
Now, I want you-- - Harvey, what's going on?
- Excuse me.
But you can't talk to Mr. Kinkle without an appointment.
It's okay.
I've got 30 seconds free if we keep walking.
Well, it's good to see you're back in school.
Yep.
I'm here to see how much it'll cost to knock it down.
- What?
- I need a headquarters for my empire.
So I'm gonna rase the entire block and put up a skyscraper.
But you can't.
There's a orphanage and a retirement home on this block.
And lucky for me, old folks and kids are bad negotiators.
Sabrina, you should drop out of school.
I've got enough money to support both of us.
And despite your intelligence, I think you'd make a great trophy wife.
I've gotta do something.
I can't stand what Harvey's become.
Dope fiend?
Degenerate gambler?
Petty thief?
An aggressive, ambitious multimillionaire.
How awful.
- Tell Harvey I always liked him.
- I've gotta show him he's going down the wrong path.
Well, why not cast a prognosis-hypnosis spell?
Shows a person what could happen if they keep doing what they're doing.
- There's such a spell?
- It's a classic.
And it's perfect for this situation.
Thanks, Salem.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No.
Can't think of a thing.
- Okay.
Gotta go.
- Uh-- Sabrina.
I'm--  Curse my sarcastic nature.
Harvey?
Harvey Kinkle?
Move it.
Sabrina?
Did my parents let you in?
I'm here to show you your future.
No more lobster and chocolate cake before bed.
Who's that?
Trixie, your third wife.
As vacant and as dimwitted a woman as ever walked this Earth.
- Great bone structure.
- Mm.
Hello, family.
Father's home.
Now, I must get back to the office.
Harvey.
Honey.
Rex and Lucy have been feeling a bit down lately.
- And they are?
- Your children.
- Oh, right, right.
- I'm not sure they feel loved.
Oh, no problem.
I'll have my secretary write them an affectionate note.
About that.
I think you've seen enough.
Let's go.
What's all this?
It might have something to do with the chemical plant you put on the football field.
Fair enough, but why the gas masks?
What's all this?
The results of years of Kinkle Inc.'s desecration of the land in the name of corporate profits.
- Wow.
- See that one lone tree over there?
That's the state park you commissioned.
If people don't like all this, why don't they just move to the country?
This is the country.
You should see what you've done to the city.
Let me guess, my birthday party?
No.
Your funeral.
Everyone is glad you're dead.
Because you and your boundless ambition have systematically wiped out all that is good and right with the world.
- Wow.
- Something to think about, huh?
So now that you've seen your future, how do you feel?
Bad.
You know what I regret most?
- Everything?
- That state park.
- What a waste of space.
- Uh-- Aunt Zelda, I really messed up.
I need some sage-aunt advice.
Sure, honey.
Just let me finish melting my army men.
Sabrina.
I just heard on the radio that they're demolishing your school tomorrow to make way for, and I quote, "Industrialist Harvey Kinkle's new chemical plant".
Did I mention I might have dumped some Ambition products on Harvey?
Mm.
And things turned out well, I see.
Aunt Zelda, what am I gonna do?
Very unsafe, Private Ryan.
Let's take a look at Ambition's ingredients and have a talk with Zsa Zsa.
Something's weird here.
Cousin Zsa Zsa, you sold me Ambition with no Perspective.
And that's dangerous.
You've sold Blind Ambition.
Perspective is imported.
It's very expensive.
Well, import some now.
I mean it.
Okay, okay.
There's your Perspective.
- Put it on Sabrina's tab.
ZSA  Mm.
Should we have the bulldozer roll over the protesters, sir?
No.
Get their names and addresses and remind me to destroy their lives later.
Okay, Harvey, time for a little Perspective.
Gross, gross, gross.
Sir, are you ready to break ground?
Let's not tear down the school.
I like the food, and I've heard good things about the educational stuff.
And I'd like to give all my money to the orphans and old people.
And old orphans get twice as much.
I gotta get back to working on that engine.
I feel like my old self again: relaxed, content and broke.
It's good to have you back, Harvey.
But did you have to give it all away?
My dad thinks I might have had what's known as a manic episode.
Ha.
So glad your dad figures these things out.
Heh.
Well, here's my SAT-prep class.
Mind if I join you?
- Really?
- Yep.
I want to be the brightest, best-educated, most widely read mechanic there is.
I love a boy with ambition.
Huh.
Your moccasins are off my feet.
Wow.
Well, good.
Maybe you can buckle down and get your work done and stop with the pranks.
Yours are gone too.
Wow.
You know, that was a really interesting experiment.
I rue losing the grant, and yet there was a certain lightness in not feeling so driven.
I found that--  I'm back.
Sabrina.
Could you either remove these bandages or kill me?
Ah.
Oh-ho.
- Salem, you're visible again.
- Yes.
But I think I've broken every bone in my body.
So could you please put the bandages back on?
Well, thanks for coming, Cousin Zsa Zsa.
Aside from the fact that you switched Hilda and Zelda's personalities, almost destroyed my boyfriend's soul, made Salem invisible, and took us for every penny we've got it's been a nice visit.
And I've got a present for you.
It's a clue to the family secret.
Never gets old.
Actually, a snake really is a clue to the family secret.
Well, I'm off.
Toodles.
Bye.
Well, I'm glad we threw out all those Ambition products.
All that was left was a little bit of shampoo.
Oh, no.
I think I used it to clean tape off Salem.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Greed is good.
Greed clarifies.
Greed strengthens.
Now get me Trump on the horn, pronto.
Yes, I'll hold.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
With all due respect, brain freeze is something you bring on yourself.
I went a little haywire when we bet on who could drink a Polar Freeze the fastest.
N-oh!
Well, if it's any consolation at this difficult time, you lost.
So according to our deal, you owe me one giant surprise gift.
Kinkle, Spellman.
Is Mr. Kraft still dating your aunt Zelda?
No.
See?
I'm in denial about it.
You better go.
Hey, kids.
We were just getting ready to watch a video.
Why don't you join us?
That is, if you think you can handle the bittersweet anarchy of Billy Jack Goes to Washington.
Cool.
Unh!
Oh, brain freeze.
I better get him home.
Baywatch: The Early Years.
Huh!
Salem, quit staring at me.
Sorry.
I just can't stop reliving the disgusting spectacle I witnessed at that table last night.
Aunt Hilda told her "I-could- have-been-a-great-dancer" story?
Worse.
Right where you're sitting, Zelda was making goo-goo eyes with the Casanova of the hall pass, Willard Kraft.
Oh!
Gross, gross, gross.
Think happy thoughts, like bunnies and flowers.
I'm glad Aunt Zelda's found a boyfriend, but couldn't it have been a mammal?
Personally, I'm over it.
Oh, sure, I had issues with my sister dating a man who's still hopelessly in love with me, but then I just decided to let it go.
- I suggest you do the same.
- You're right.
- It's not like he's moving in.
Ha-ha-ha.
Good morning, ladies.
Where's my zoo-zoo?
Is that my monkey?
Friends don't let friends talk baby talk.
There she is.
- Ready for your breakfast gordita?
- Ooh.
Ooh.
It looks muy bueno.
I'll tell you what muys my bueno is when you wear your hair up like that.
I will live through this.
It's not working.
Oh, Sabrina, I almost forgot, I can't drive you to school this morning, but, luckily, Willard said he'd be delighted to take you.
Super.
And Sabrina didn't get brain freeze because she allows the slush to sit in her mouth and reach body temperature before exposing it to her soft palette.
You spend entirely too much time at frozenslushy.com.
So, what surprise are you gonna get her?
The biggest surprise might be no surprise.
So, what you're saying is you need my help?
Wha--?
I warned you to roll up your windows when we hit school property.
But you didn't say it was because students pelt you with garbage.
I thought that was implied.
Now, if you'll excuse me, these hallways are crying out for the iron fist of order.
Ugh.
I have milk in my ear.
"Nebraska Steaks proudly offers a belt-busting roundup of flanks and franks sure to satisfy even your most obese relatives".
- Ungawa.
- Salem.
Did we see you playing with a dog?
Uh-- Absolutely not.
Hate them.
Aha.
There's a trail of slobber on your back.
It's hair product?
All right.
He answers to "Silky," his owner's a butcher, and I'm letting him bat me around to get meat.
It's time you look into a little thing we call "dignity".
And get rid of that steak catalogue.
We know you don't read the articles.
Stop.
No.
No, Willard.
I'm sure Hilda and Sabrina won't mind.
Bye, monkey.
Won't mind what?
Willard's grandmother is doing a massive renovation on her house, so Willard needs a place to stay.
I told him he could use the apartment over the garage.
But we don't have an apartment over our garage.
We do now.
By the way, I mind a lot.
I've never minded anything so much in my life.
- Don't you mind?
- Nope.
I centre on my chi, and I am free from care.
Well, I'm not.
I'll go mad, I tell you.
Mad!
- Hey.
- Hey.
Any ideas?
Think Sabrina would like some car mats?
That's not the greatest gift idea when you don't have a car.
You know what, it's not the greatest gift idea when you do have a car.
Hey.
How about a photo portrait of the two of you?
But I already bought the car mats.
Hey, guys, what's up?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Oh, good.
Valerie's helping you pick out my gift.
KRAFT : Attention, students.
This is your vice principal.
A recruiter from Burger World University will be meeting today with any interested fifth-year seniors, and, on a personal note to Sabrina Spellman, your aunt wants us to bring home bread and toilet paper.
Sabrina, is Mr. Kraft living in your house?
No.
He's living over the garage, which is further from the house than most restraining orders.
I'll probably never see him.
Salem, I have a few questions about carbon monoxide, garage apartments, and making something look like an accident.
- Woof.
- Beg your pardon?
I said, "What a pity.
Now, roll over".
Oh.
Berlitz's How To Speak Dog?
I'm improving myself.
MAN : Which way to the biblioteca?
Aar-ruf!
Shame on you.
Silky thinks he's your friend and you're using him for your own pleasure.
I thought that was the point of dogs.
Besides, I am helping him.
He'll never manage his owner until he learns how to beg.
If the result is beefsteak for the cat, so be it.
Maybe you can train him to chase Mr. Kraft out of the neighbourhood.
Aar-ruf!
Stop asking me where the library is.
I'm in crisis here.
I can't take it anymore.
Our house has become the Smithsonian of his toenail clippings.
Isn't he driving you crazy?
I have made a personal choice not to be affected by Willard Kraft.
He used your toothbrush.
Deep, cleansing breath.
BOTH : Love lift us up where we belong Where the eagles fly On a mountain high Zelda, you complete me.
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna get my copy of Love Letters and we can read them to each other.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh!
Mmm.
That is one special lady.
You know, you might wanna start thinking about calling me "Uncle Willard".
Well, they're always looking for nuns, right?
Just breathe and let it go, Sabrina.
You can call me "Uncle Willard" too, Hilda.
He must be destroyed!
Ruf!
Ruf!
Ruf-ruf-ruf-ruf.
Ruf!
Ruf!
Ruf-ruf-ruf-ru-- Shoot.
What's the word for "floor"?
Oh, yeah.
Uh-- Woof!
So we'd just be getting Mr. Kraft out of here for Aunt Zelda's own good.
Absolutely.
Someday she'll thank us.
- Should we poison him?
- Don't you think that's a little harsh?
Love lifts them up where they belong?
I knew he was bothering you.
We've gotta find some dirt on Kraft that will make Zelda break up with him.
Oh!
Perfect: "Real Life Story".
We need some dirt And we need it fast So give us the scoop On Willard Kraft Welcome to Real Life Story's "Mediocrity Week".
Tonight we explore the strange journey of Willard Kraft.
Elementary school classmates describe him as "a loner," "an outsider" and "doodie breath".
Let's fast-forward through puberty.
My hunch is it's ugly.
Well, I know he had a messy divorce.
Ooh.
Hit "play".
Her name was Lucy, the only woman who could give Willard the courage to dream again.
Love transformed the normally vexatious loner into a frolicking free spirit.
Whimsy was his copilot.
Indeed, Willard Kraft was in love with love.
They were married in a small, private ceremony presided over by her massage therapist.
They were so in love.
I can't just sit here and let Zelda get hurt by a man who still loves two other women.
Two?
Oh, right.
We've gotta bring her back.
It's gonna be so hard on Aunt Zelda.
I don't think I can do that to her.
Has anyone seen my antifungal foot ointment?
Mr. Kraft With a past so juicy Return to us His ex-wife Lucy Ah.
It's good to be back in the mortal realm.
"Mortal realm"?
Wait a minute.
You're a witch?
Mr. Kraft married a witch?
Well, of course, he didn't know I was a witch.
I thought it would be less confusing that way.
Oh.
I have my magic again.
Oh, I adore the mortal realm.
It's such a refreshing change from where I live: The Republic of Infinite Horror.
Sounds exotic.
It's near Lake Male Superior.
It's an awful part of the Other Realm where women are forbidden to use magic.
Who came up with that brainstorm?
LUCY AND  The men.
Then why don't you move to the mortal realm?
My republic forbids a woman to emigrate without a husband, and that's why I married Willard.
And because you loved him.
Okay.
And I would do anything to get him back.
Oh, dear, here come the waterworks.
So why did you two split up?
Why does any relationship go bad?
Maybe I shouldn't have turned him into a beast of burden, or made out with his best friend Dexter.
The bottom line is Willard divorced me, and without him, I was deported back to the I.H. - Infinite Horror.
- Right.
Well, if it helps at all, I think he's right downstairs.
Really?
I haven't seen him since the day I left the fence unlatched and he got out.
She seems nice.
Oh.
Hoo-hoo.
Boy, I shouldn't wait a week to irrigate my ears.
Mr. Kraft, we have a surprise for you.
Willard, darling.
No.
No.
No, no, no.
No, no, no.
This is a bad dream.
I'm so glad he's still alive.
Hey, Valerie, I made an appointment at a portrait studio and I have the perfect way to get Sabrina there and keep it a surprise.
I'll tell her war has broken out and I have to take her to a secret bomb shelter.
Or you could just blindfold her and tell her it's a surprise.
Okay.
So much for the sound-effect tapes I've been making.
- Hello.
Oh, there you are, stranger.
I was beginning to worry about you.
Well, actually, I just came by to borrow some coriander.
I'm making dinner for Lucy.
- Lucy's a nice lady.
Lucy?
As in your ex-wife Lucy?
Yes, apparently, she left a hole in my life, and I You look nice, Zelda.
Willie-poo.
- Coming.
Say goodbye to Uncle Willard.
I go to the trouble of brewing you a cup of my special herb tea and you disappear.
Is it just me or are men getting less obedient than they used to be?
You must be Lucy.
I'm Zelda.
It's so nice to meet you.
I really miss you.
- Drink your tea, dear.
- Oh.
Hmm.
Oh.
Lucy has pretty eyes, and thanks to her, no more runaway mucus.
No more tissues in the sofa cushion.
I can't wait.
Well, if you'll excuse us, I think a certain Willie-poo has a dinner to make.
Right, a dinner.
They seem civil after all these years.
I think I'll take a little walk.
- It's working.
- Yay!
- And Aunt Zelda's okay, right?
- Absolutely.
This breakup was bound to happen sooner or later, and let's face it, the sooner the breakup, the less pain for us.
Ruf!
Ruf!
Good, boy.
Yeah, baby.
I can taste the fillets.
I'll just pretend his frothy spit is a garnish.
It's so nice that both of you could join us for a glass of wine.
Well, I knew there was no way I'd get this one out of the house without me, so I finally said, "Willie-poo, enough with the foot rubs".
You know, he calls me "zoo-zoo".
- I do?
- Yes, and I call you "monkey".
Like some godless hairy primate?
No, like a cute little monkey with big eyes.
And, now, he answers to "poo".
There's a trade up.
I'll get more wine.
You two seem to be getting along well.
I like Lucy.
She's a nice lady.
- Oh, stop.
- I'm sorry.
Was that--?
Was that bad?
No, dear, it's a figure of speech.
Fig--?
You're not gonna hit me, then?
Well - Ooh.
I like your hair up like that.
Willard!
You look dehydrated.
Didn't you wanna tell Zelda something?
Yes.
Ahem.
Zelda, I'm moving out of the garage.
Lucy has room for me at her place.
So thanks.
I see.
Well, let me tell you something.
I-- I got you cable in that garage.
What am I doing?
I'm grovelling.
I'm debasing myself for a man.
I sound like Hilda.
Well, we should go.
Your best friend Dexter's coming over, isn't he?
- Shall I carry you, dear?
- No, not this time.
We'll see ourselves out.
I do not debase myself for a man.
I'm worried about Aunt Zelda.
Oh, yeah, her.
Boy, it's a good thing you found out about it now, eh, Zellie?
I don't blame Willard.
- He seems happy.
- You don't mind?
Oh.
When you truly care about someone, you-- You want what's best for them.
But I'm gonna miss him.
Told you it was for the best.
I really don't know why I care about that man, just he makes me so happy.
Aunt Zelda, you don't know the whole story.
Lucy's from the Other Realm.
I brought her back.
You what?
Aunt Hilda and I brought her back.
We had to.
He did yoga in a unitard.
Wait a minute.
Lucy's a witch?
Yeah, and she's using magic to get him back.
He doesn't like her, it's the tea talking.
How dare you two try to break up Willard and me.
Don't dwell on the past.
You can compete with Lucy.
Start brewing potions pronto.
Try the All's-Fair- in-Love-and-War spell.
Quick.
I think she's ordering him an ear tag.
Maybe one little potion.
I've got to get that modem fixed.
Oh, look, your hair's down again.
I guess everything eventually loses the battle with gravity.
Silence!
Do you know why the council pulled you in here, ladies?
Because you're lonely?
"Two witches battling over a mortal" A vice principal?
He's a heartbeat away from running the entire high school.
And he loves me.
- Your Honour, I'm not involved with-- - Silence!
Well, you know the law.
The Witches' Council has clearly stated that cases such as these must be settled in an appropriate forum, one that is fair and full of wisdom.
CROWD : Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
The Jerry Springer Show?
Zelda thought she had a good thing going with Willard until his ex-wife Lucy came to town with a simple warning: "Get your hands off my mortal".
Ooh!
Why are they so excited?
Because he's my man.
You were just keeping him warm till I got back.
Ooh!
Obviously, you're very upset.
Tell us how it all started.
Well, you have to understand, Mr. Kraft is not just Zelda's boyfriend.
He's also my vice principal.
Ooh!
- And my ex-boyfriend.
It was really hard living with him, so we decided to bring back his ex-wife.
- But we didn't know she was a witch.
- Oh, everyone can just--   Oh!
- She's not swearing.
- I know, but this way, it sounds like she did.
I think it's time now that we bring out the mortal and maybe he can decide which witch.
Please welcome Willard Kraft!
Lucy?
And Zelda?
Where am I?
You're with me, dear.
Come and sit down.
Don't do it, Willard.
I really care about you.
She's just using you.
Honey, all the magic in your bag couldn't get you a man.
CROWD : Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
I didn't expect the show would take this direction, so we'll be right back.
Silky, boy!
Stupid dog, he should be back by now.
If he ran across a tennis ball, I'm doomed.
We are back, and it's time for Willard to choose.
Will it be Lucy or Zelda?
Tell you what, before we let him choose, we have a surprise.
You see, we did a potion check on Willard.
Ooh!
- Okay, now, this is what a normal man looks like.
As you can see, very few potions, because we, as witches, have to remember that we cannot use magic irresponsibly.
You know, there are those that-- I'm sorry, that's my "final thought".
That comes later.
Let's check in on Willard.
Wow.
That is worse than Elvis' autopsy.
I did it for his own good.
He was weak.
And if it got me out of the Infinite Horror, well, that was a sacrifice I was willing to make.
You've got to drain him, Jerry.
Okay, now, Willard, you are back to normal.
So are you ready to make a decision?
Jerry, this woman is still trying to kill me  Ooh!
and this lady laughs at my little jokes  - and has the sweetest smile.
- Oh.
So I guess I'm what you'd have to call a "no-brainer".
It's Lucy.
- I'm only kidding you.
It's Zelda.
- No.
You change your mind, you spineless slug, because I ain't going back to hell-town.
Ooh!
- Oh, yes, you are.
CROWD : Jerry!
Jerry!
Jerry!
Everyone laughs at that show, but when you're on it, something just takes over.
I hope you've learned your lesson.
You claimed you and Sabrina were helping Zelda when, in fact, you were just helping you and Sabrina.
You did the same thing with Silky.
You weren't training him to help Silky.
It was all for Salem.
I guess we were both being selfish.
Of course, in my case, it worked out.
Venison?
Oh, what a day.
I just saw Willard home and gave him a potion to keep him from remembering any of this.
Not another potion.
Oh, it'll flush out with his Metamucil.
And as soon as the swelling goes down in my jaw, I wanna talk to you and Sabrina.
- Where is she?
- Valerie whisked her away.
It seemed very important and rather formal.
This had better be good.
It hasn't exactly been the best day.
Relax.
Just have a seat right here.
Can I take my blindfold off now?
- Something you should know-- - Shh.
Okay.
Let's get this show on the road.
I want you to know that just because I'm seeing your aunt, don't expect any special treatment around here.
- I don't, Mr. Kraft.
- Yeah, no favours, no politics, and no calling me "Willard".
It'll be hard, but okay.
In fact, I'm gonna have to give you detention this Friday.
What?
Why?
Because Zelda told me you'd been watching Jerry Springer instead of doing your homework and that just ain't kosher, milady.
- Well, she watches too.
- Hey!
Don't take that tone with me.
I am still vice principal of this school, and I demand respect.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Morning.
Oh, who'd call us at this hour?
Oh, we have to send our magic in for its 25-year overhaul.
Consumer Reports says be careful where you tune up your magic.
You could get ripped off.
Well, it's gonna take me a couple of weeks to clear off my magic to-do list.
When do we have to send it in?
Today.
Hilda, is it possible that you forgot to mention a previous warning?
- Or three.
- Three?
Zellie, you wouldn't hurt an unarmed girl, would you?
So how about that weather?
Is it seasonal, or what?
Morning.
Well, Sabrina, thanks to the incompetence of your Aunt Hilda, the two of us are going to be without magic for a couple of days.
Wow, that sort of makes me the most powerful woman - in the household.
- In a way.
What would the most powerful woman in the household have for breakfast?
I know, ice cream.
Long live the teen.
Tonight's show will bowl you over.
Why do we have to look for the Family Secret Board now?
Because Sabrina's at school, and I wanna surprise her with it.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to see the look of indifference on her face.
Oh!
Didn't you get the memo?
This is my fort.
Salem, what are you doing here?
Looking for something to play with.
All my toys have developed an unfortunate patina of spit.
Have you seen the Family Secret Board?
No, but it might help if I knew what it was.
It's an ancient heirloom.
Sabrina will use it to display the clues to the family secret, so she can decipher them and solve it.
- There.
- See it?
No, but I believe that's an old shoe I haven't had my way with.
- Wait.
I think I found something.
- In the rodent family?
Please, God.
One priceless antique.
Oh, wonderful.
And three pirates.
Uh-oh.
Hilda, you were supposed to free these men a hundred years ago.
I blame the McKinley administration.
Sorry.
- Oh.
- That's okay.
Well, the Witches' Council isn't going to be happy about this.
Housing prisoners is a sacred duty.
Almost as sacred as letting them go.
Excuse me.
May we have some water?
And maybe some oxygen?
Oh, yeah.
Yes, of course.
And maybe a bath.
Oh-ho.
Ho-ho-ho.
Tassels.
Oh, y-- Oh, y-- Oh, yes!
Hey, where'd Hilda and Zelda go?
Oh, well.
Tassels.
Guys, the new club on Grover is opening tonight, and we have to go.
I can't.
I've gotta go to the library.
I promised my mom I'd research car seats to find the safest kind.
Apparently, the ones they used for us were death-traps.
See you later.
We have to go to this club.
It's an over-18 club.
That means people there are driving, getting ready to go to college and maybe even have part-time jobs.
- Valerie, you just described us.
- Yeah, but they're all over 18.
Oh, don't you tickle me, you little stringy thingy, because I'm the boss, and I-- No!
The Family Secret Board.
Well, needless to say, Uh-oh.
"SpaghettiOs".
So, what did the Witches' Council say?
"Since their release is so--" And "so" is underlined.
"--overdue," we have to rehabilitate them before the council will restore their magic and return them to polite witch society.
Well, that shouldn't be so hard.
They seem to respond well to food.
Sit.
See?
You know, I've said this a lot over the last few hundred years, but I'm going to say it again-- Oh.
This is all your fault.
I can't pick a diaper service.
It's too hard.
You said the same thing when your parents asked you to do their taxes.
I found out the club has a great band playing tonight.
Listen, Valerie, I'm not in the mood, Harvey's busy, we're not 18.
- It's 'N Sync.
- And that changes everything.
"Tidy Diaper"?
"Dr. Doodie"?
Why couldn't my parents just get a dog?
"Heirloom: A family item passed from one generation to the next.
Usually irreplaceable".
Shoot.
I guess I gotta fix that board, or find a more forgiving dictionary.
Let's try it again.
Walk through the living room like gentlemen.
Whoo-hoo!
- Big improvement.
- Yes, much better than last time, when you got liquored up and set the couch on fire.
Hi.
I've gotta hurry.
I've gotta wait in line to see a cool band.
The club's on Grover, the Mineshaft.
Valerie'll be there.
I'll be home by curfew.
Love you both.
Why are there pirates in the living room?
- Hello.
- Ha-ha-ha.
What we're doing is not bad.
No.
It's not close to bad.
It'snot bad.
- We're practically 18.
- It's a just number.
- We won't smoke or drink.
- I won't curse.
We'll tell them our friends are inside, and they have our ID's.
Sail in like we've been here a million times.
- ID's?
- We don't have any.
We're only 17.
Maybe we should've rehearsed a little bit more.
Yeah.
Deh.
There.
That's one.
Only about a million more pieces of this heirloom to go.
Maybe it's time to start exploring the options in running away from home.
I'm looking forward to cringing every time I think about what just happened.
Sabrina, Valerie.
I saw what happened.
Here's a place where you can get fake ID's fast.
- Tear it up.
We're not going there.
- You're right.
Let's hurry it up.
'N Sync is starting.
This doesn't seem like a very good neighbourhood.
Yeah, the place where I commit my other crimes is usually much more upscale.
- Yeah?
- Actually - ID's?
Twenty bucks.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Heh-heh.
Here.
Can you see the picture?
Urban decay doesn't make for the best light.
- We're not doing anything wrong.
- No, absolutely nothing wrong.
I feel very proud-- Cops!
You know what would make this go faster?
Hands, and a work ethic.
You're at a dinner party and there are ladies present.
- Oh!
- Ladies.
- So you?
- I know.
- Excellent.
- There you go, milady.
Good.
Now the ladies are seated.
And then you?
- Hilda!
- What?
We're just minutes away from being deaf.
- Out.
- What happened?
I think I see the problem.
I'm not a cross-eyed redhead, and you're not a middle-aged black man.
Now, Hilda's going to pretend to be a salesman.
- Let's review.
- No running.
- Or screaming.
- Right.
Good, good.
- Hello there.
- Ha, ha!
Okay, no.
You don't greet a guest by stabbing them.
- Oops.
- This bumbling-idiot thing, it's really starting to wear thin.
Sabrina, you're home early.
Yeah, it hasn't been a good night.
Sorry.
Mine hasn't exactly been stellar either.
Would you mind?
Okay, this once.
If I start leaking bile, mister, someone's getting a time-out.
Meh.
Finally, the last piece.
Now all I have to do is put the whole thing back together, or I could tell Hilda and Zelda the truth and take my punishment like a man.
Where's the hot glue gun?
Uhn!
What are you doing home in your room?
'N Sync was playing at the Mineshaft, but I couldn't get in, because I'm not completely old enough.
You should get a fake ID.
What kind of person do you think I am?
A person who should be out of the house on a Friday night.
Especially out of her room.
You know, the Other Realm has excellent fake ID's.
Really?
The Other Realm?
- What is this, a fake ID franchise?
- Evening.
Fake ID?
Two, please.
One for me and my friend Valerie.
- She looks like-- - No problem.
Huh.
These are great.
I especially like my evening gown.
But do you think my hair?
Cops!
First, I'll get all the edge pieces together.
Let's see Hmm.
A tassel.
Don't toy with me, you saucy minx.
Oh-ho-ho.
Ha-ha.
I can't believe how good these are.
- Where'd you get them?
- Oh, the same place.
I just complained to the manager, and they made everything right.
I never think to do things like that.
ID's?
They're not fake, if that's what you're thinking.
- Not that you would be thinking-- - She's just very excited.
You know, us being able to vote and everything.
Go in.
Whoo-hoo!
- Hey, I'm an organ donor.
- Ha-ha.
Now, there's soda, and there's rum.
Which would you like to drink?
Now, remember, you're on parole.
- Oh.
- Exactly.
Gentlemen!
- Go for the jugular!
- Hilda!
I am sorry, but they're getting on my nerves.
Come on!
Come on!
Baby, I don't understand Just why we can't be lovers Things are getting Out of hand Coming to this club was the best idea I've ever had.
- God bless fake ID's.
- Whoo!
But, baby, we can win Let it go If you want me, girl Let me know I am down On my knees I can't take it anymore It's tearin' up my heart When I'm with you But when we are apart I feel it too And no matter what I do Nah!
It took all evening, but I put the board together.
Man, 18-year-olds have fun.
- What was that?
- Candy wrappers.
Boy, am I beat.
I'm going to put this away the magical way.
Excellent.
- Hey!
Huh?
Sorry, sweetie, but now that you have an Other Realm fake ID, your magic is also fake.
My magic is fake?
Why can't they just outlaw all the illegal stuff?
Okay, I'm not gonna panic.
Maybe it's just certain types of magic that are fake.
I'll just put myself over there by the window.
Good.
Okay, now I'm queasy.
Try seeing that with cat food in your stomach.
FAKE  Your magic is now just an illusion.
It may look real, but when you examine it closer, you see it's really fake.
Gotta get rid of this thing.
Stupid lamination.
Maybe your aunts can help.
Good idea.
They always get a kick out of "Sabrina defying authority" stories.
- If told with puppets.
- I just have to avoid them until I can figure this all out.
Sabrina!
Hurry!
- Stupid.
- I just asked: "What do you do when a lady comes in the room"?
- He got it wrong.
- Could you help, please?
Sure.
- Odd.
- Oh, I think my finger's tired.
Have you tried this?
Yow.
- Gotta go.
- I'll just keep this for a while, mister.
Aha.
It says here, "If more than one ID was procured, all must be returned".
That's the answer.
One a.m. Too late to visit Valerie?
Not if you don't mind an arrest report on your record.
You're right.
I'll just get it from her first thing tomorrow.
What are these hard pieces in my bed?
The broken shards of my future.
- Very nice.
- Ho-ho-ho.
- Fine.
- I'm fine.
Heh.
- Have you been gutting fish again?
- Well, just I've gotta go.
Early Bible study.
Could you zap in breakfast before you go?
No time.
First prayer's always the best.
- Okay, well, I guess it's Tang again.
- Oh, Tang.
No.
Hey, Sabrina.
My mom liked the changing table I picked out.
- Oh, terrific.
- It's brown.
- Wanna see a picture?
- Sure.
Valerie, I need to get that ID back from you.
- My mom has it.
- Why did you give it to her?
She found it, but luckily she was lenient.
I'm just not allowed to have any fun ever again.
So would it be a problem to steal it back from her?
I know I've said it before, but the pirates being here is all your fault.
Oh, pipe down and help me find the cattle prod.
What is this?
- Toast.
Oh, yeah.
You got a message from the Other Realm.
- Got stuck in my sourdough.
- Do you remember what it said?
"Your magic is ready to be picked up".
Give or take a butter stain or two.
- Finally.
- Yes!
Now when those barbarians go to kiss us, we can remove their lips.
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't just leave the pirates here alone.
- They're sleeping.
- Yes, but for how long?
You don't know how hard you hit them with that vase.
I'm home.
Sabrina.
Dear, would you mind keeping an eye on the pirates while we run to the Other Realm?
You can handle them.
- You've got magic.
- But-- They're sleeping in the dining room.
Don't ask.
Okay, I can handle this.
No problem.
I'll just tiptoe so they don't wake up.
Hello.
Sabrina, my parents are freaking out.
- The ID is talking.
- What?
Oh, that's just a security device.
I'm the only one who knows how to turn it off.
- I'll bring it right over.
- Good.
- No!
Pirates!
- Pirates?
I didn't say pirates.
I said, by gum.
By gum, don't come here.
We'll meet halfway.
At school.
What if they wake up?
There.
That should hold them.
There.
One crisis averted, one to go.
Aah!
So our magic is being delivered to our house.
And, as usual, Salem got it wrong.
And as usual the Magic Maintenance Department - was rude about it.
- At least Sabrina's keeping an eye on the pirates.
I hope that was just fiction about pirates eating cats.
Whoo!
Ha-ha.
Oh, not the board.
Anything but the board!
Oh!
Or the cat.
Shh.
We got magic.
- I love magic.
- Ha-ha-ha!
I'm so sorry.
I never should've gotten the talking ID's.
- I saw the lips move.
- Oh.
Hologram.
You know criminals.
They're always a step ahead.
Yeah, but it was yelling at me.
Oh, hey!
I think I see your parents.
Aren't you grounded?
- I'll crawl back through the sewers.
- Okay.
Two of two ID's do I wield Take them back So my magic will be real Yes.
Pirates!
Oh, thank heavens they're still here.
What do the words "stay home and watch the pirates" mean to you?
- Sorry.
I'll free you.
- You can't.
We're magically tied.
- How?
The pirates don't-- - The pirates got our magic.
Don't ask.
- Please, do something to stop them.
- Sure.
You should just know that I only left to help someone in trouble: Me.
Thank goodness I have magic.
Which witch should we kill first?
PIRATE 1: Ha-ha!
- It's Peter Pan!
- You're all codfishes.
- We're doomed.
Oh!
A wire?
I was flying by wire?
It was an illusion?
Gotta go.
Ah.
I'll never bat a tassel again.
I sent back both ID's.
Why is my magic still fake?
They said you had to return all ID's.
They didn't say that would fix things.
You know, I'm getting a little tired of these technicalities.
Sabrina!
- And that!
Please let this be good news.
- Oh, could be worse.
- Sabrina, there are sharks!
- Help!
- Okay, this may not be the best time to tell you, but I got a fake ID from the Other Realm - and now my magic is no longer real.
- Just point!
Oh!
You couldn't have replaced it with pillows?
Get up fast.
The tank's gonna come back.
It's just an illusion.
You're fine now.
Get our magic back.
Why did my magic come back?
To get rid of fake magic caused by a fake ID, you have to confess to the adults in charge and accept their punishment.
Get my magic!
All I-- All I have to do is get the board down to the basement, and no one will ever know.
What the--?
What's my punishment?
We'll let you know pending our survival.
- Look out!
- Aah!
Ho-ho!
Thank you.
- Aah!
- No, it's going for my magic.
Freeze.
You fought a good fight.
Thanks.
Man, it was tough.
Like a real test, you know?
- Almost like a punishment, I'd say.
- And yet, it wasn't.
- No.
We had something else in mind.
- Taking down the boat.
By hand.
Ow!
I got another splinter.
Why couldn't the pirates have conjured a sanded boat?
How ever you decide to handle that wound, do not, I repeat, do not chew your hand off.
I had a cat friend who learned that the hard way.
This seems to be coming along well.
I got a splinter.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell it to Child Services.
- What about Valerie?
- I told her parents I got the ID's.
Expect a phone call from them berating you.
Well, this whole pirate ordeal started because we were looking for the board you need to decode the family secret.
I see.
So the punishment continues?
- Salem!
I tried so hard.
I'm not a puzzle person.
It's okay.
It's the effort that counts.
Were you drunk?
We'll just have to use the other board.
Th--?
There's another board?
Duh-heh.
Okay, these are my clues to the family secret.
Which relative gave me a picture of fire?
One of the pirates.
- I'm related to them?
It involves a third cousin and a crazy night in Kingston, Jamaica.
You know, with all the clues nicely displayed like that, I still can't begin to figure out the family secret.
Think it has something to do with manure?
- Where do you get that?
- I just like saying manure.
- Please?
- I've got an idea.
Enjoy the show.
No ID required.
ALL : Your love is like a river Peaceful and deep Your soul is like a secret That I never could keep When I look into your eyes I know that it's true God must have spent A little more time on you
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Rose are red, violets are blue You remind me of primordial goo And they said I couldn't find a card for Libby.
Oh, no.
I'm losing my hair.
Yesterday, I counted six hairs in my kitty comb.
Today, there's ten.
- Eleven.
- Huh?
Do you think Harvey and I might be soul mates?
Depends.
Would you still love him if he was bald?
Of course.
Unless he did that weird comb-over thing.
Ooh.
- Twelve.
- Oh.
Sabrina, you gotta help me.
I don't wanna be a chrome dome.
Mmm.
I like it.
But can I swim in it?
No channel surfing.
Sabrina, hurry up.
It's time for breakfast.
I'm coming.
You don't have to-- Have my room attacked by Huns.
Looks like somebody's made Cupid angry.
Well, he is a lonely, bitter man.
"Sabrina, because you meddled in the laws of love, and tried to break up your Aunt Zelda and Mr. Kraft" How does he know that?
It's Cupid's job to know those things.
And I might have mentioned it to him at a cocktail party.
"You must help two people fall in love by Valentine's Day, or spend weekends picking up trash along the Other Realm interstate".
Ew!
I don't wanna spend my time chained to a bunch of drunks in orange jumpsuits.
Well, they're not all drunks.
Some are murderers.
Look.
I really am losing my hair.
Oh, wait.
That's my butt.
But who am I gonna set up?
Well, let's see.
There's-- I just met the most amazing guy.
See, Hilda?
I knew that polka class at Learning Annex would pay off.
- Where's your lollipop, Kojak?
- Grrr.
Anyway, Carlton's smart, handsome, funny.
Absolutely nothing like Willard.
I knew you'd like him.
That takes care of my assignment.
Cupid may wear a diaper, but he's no fool.
And he asked me out for Valentine's Day.
He's always coming up with crazy, offbeat ideas like that.
See you.
This is the best time in a Hilda relationship.
Before she spends any time with him.
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey.
Do you think that guy's dating anyone?
Yeah.
I think he's dating that guy.
Hey, good news about Valentine's Day.
My dad's helping that fancy French restaurant, Le Petit Chien, with its roach problem, and he snagged us a reservation.
One downside to the restaurant, though: No salad bar.
Hey, hey.
No PDA in the hallway.
I'm gonna have to write you both up.
By the by, hope your Aunt Zelda doesn't mind Easter candy for Valentine's.
Mother really wants it out of the freezer.
Hey.
Those two would make a cute couple.
Isn't there a rule about lunch ladies dating students?
Why are you being so difficult, Valerie?
Break up with Justin, and let me set the two of you up again.
Harvey and I do it all the time.
It's how we keep our relationship fresh.
Salem, this hair-growth tonic you ordered is actually corn bread batter.
They wouldn't sell it if it didn't work.
Keep stirring.
Well, I'm off to France to find the perfect Valentine's Day dress.
And maybe kill an hour at a museum.
Oh, no.
Cousin Marigold and her kids are coming by to discuss the family secret.
Better hurry before Paris closes.
I'd stay, but I don't like them.
Oh, come on.
You guys can't leave me alone with Cousin Marigold.
She's like a repressed memory waiting to happen.
There.
A couple of hours, and you can call me Crystal Gayle.
I don't need a phone number, operator.
I was just wondering, are you seeing anyone?
Hello?
Sabrina.
Mwah, mwah.
Oh, you look fabulous.
But then, against this shabby wallpaper, who wouldn't?
This is my daughter, Ally.
She's never been to the-- Ahem.
To the Mortal Realm.
Hi, Ally.
You're right.
A whole lot of nothing.
Oh, honey, stop turning the towels into taffy.
You remember Amanda?
How could I forget?
Keep those fingers up where I can see them.
I love it when you can see fear in their eyes.
They have so much energy when they come to the Mortal Realm.
You know, I would have left them with a nanny, but they won't tell me what they did with her, and they're at that age.
Somewhere between birth and 25-to-life?
What happened?
Mortal plumbing can be so confusing.
And fun.
Hey, that's my sweater.
Oops.
Oh, oh.
Come here.
You'd be a good match for my son, Robby.
He's well on his way to being a juvenile delinquent too.
- I didn't know you have kids.
- Three.
Since the divorce, sometimes I bring Robby on calls with me.
He's out front playing right now.
You're well-insured, right?
Last one to zap him into a snowman is a rotten egg.
New game.
All the kids are playing it.
Gotta go.
Oh!
Thought that was pretty funny, huh?
It's not Candide, but yes.
This would go easier if you'd give me a hand.
Oh, ha!
Oh, you weren't kidding.
No.
No, I don't do tools.
Come on.
It's-- It'll be something you can tell your grandchildren.
Just hold the wrench here while I try and turn the water off.
- Like this?
- Yeah.
But, you know, pull it towards you.
Oh!
Ah.
Now that was funny, huh?
But not as funny as this.
Or, uh, this.
Or this!
Or this.
- Or this!
Oh!
- Or this!
- Or this!
- What are you doing?
Ah!
That's funny.
That's funny.
Whoa!
Please, Sabrina.
Let me turn him into a salamander.
No.
Not until you're old enough to use vindictive magic responsibly.
Okay, but not a very big salamander.
Oh, the bathroom's all fixed.
Just don't use the toilet, ever.
Girls, you're not gonna believe this, but your mother actually did manual labour.
- No.
- She ain't half bad.
Hold still.
You've got a little schmutz right there.
What's the matter with Mom?
She's acting all nice.
Better.
She's acting like she likes him.
This is perfect.
I've found my couple.
Well, thanks for dropping by.
That was very invigorating.
Well, any time you want to be invigored again, you let me know.
Bye.
Dad.
Right.
Heh.
He's so small, I'm always losing him.
Come here, you.
Oh.
Where's the water?
I need to rinse.
The tingle is now a burn.
Marigold, how could you let Emil walk out like that?
He's cute, he's single, and you're my last hope.
Me and Emil?
Oh, please, Sabrina.
The man makes a living pulling hair out of drains.
He's got a truck with his picture on the side of it.
It would never work.
Besides, I'm never gonna see him again.
Fate calling.
I could have sworn I had this with me when I left.
Oh.
Well, you didn't.
But you know, now that you're back, you can go ask Marigold out.
You obviously like her.
Don't get me wrong.
Your cousin's great, but there's no way that a rich, classy woman like her is going out with a non-rich, classy guy like me.
But you already had a splash fight.
Wait.
What are you doing tomorrow?
That's perfect, because Marigold isn't doing anything either.
- Sabrina.
- Oh, it's no trouble.
There's nothing I like to do more on Valentine's Day than cook a gourmet meal for our distant relatives and the people who fix our house.
If you don't have any other plans-- You said you'd take us to-- Actually, I'm completely free.
Great, then we'll see you tomorrow around 7, okay?
All right.
That's good.
Jeez.
Throw yourself at him, why don't you?
Sabrina, when we go to Le Petit Chien, are you gonna want an appetizer?
If you do, I'm gonna need to shovel a few more driveways.
Oh, Harvey, I can't go.
I promised my cousin I'd watch her kids while she goes on a date.
I'm helping two people fall in love and I'm avoiding hard time.
I'm really, really sorry.
I know you wouldn't break a Valentine's date if it wasn't important.
Maybe I could go with my mom.
Okay, Sabrina, I'm leaving.
Sabrina, I'm going now.
This is an authentic Paris original, so you'd better take off that knockoff.
I'm not changing.
You change your dress.
It's not like you guys are going to the same restaurant.
Sabrina makes a point.
No one you date could afford Le Petit Chien.
That's where Carlton is taking me.
You're such a copycat.
- Ah.
Am not.
See?
- Ah!
HILDA AND  Ah!
You know there's no salad bar there.
Oh, Sabrina, I am so nervous.
I've never been on a date with a mortal.
Genies, Martians, enchanted trees, but never a mortal.
All you have to do is be honest and be yourself.
I'll never remember all that.
Relax.
You and Emil are gonna do great.
Not if we have anything to do with it.
Fingers ready?
Plunger boy's going down.
Way down.
Willard's parking the car.
Carlton's parking his Porsche.
He's such a refreshing change from Willard.
Unbelievable.
Willard, what happened?
Some idiot in a Porsche tried to run me down in the parking lot.
Sorry.
I had to wait for this old geezer.
- Geezer?
- That's him.
Carlton, this is my sister, Zelda.
And this is her geezer-- I mean boyfriend, Willard.
Nice to meet you, Zelly.
And I had no idea that this old sack belonged to you.
Hey.
No hard feelings, huh, Wilbur?
It's Willard.
Of course it is.
You should have seen the look on your face.
Whew.
- Table for four?
- No.
No, I-- No, no, no.
The more the merrier, huh?
- Lead on, Willie.
- Willard.
Whew.
Your poor sister.
Can you say "loser"?
- She has low self-esteem.
- Duh.
Where did she get that arrogant blowhard?
She has low self-esteem.
Mr. Andranini, look at you all clean.
Somebody owns an iron.
Run!
Oh, I hate when people drop things out of airplanes.
And I'll have the 14-ounce sirloin.
And I'll have the 16-ounce sirloin.
You didn't let me finish.
To start.
Now tell me about your hams.
Tonight's entrÃ©e is baked chicken.
I think it's a little undercooked.
Now I've got to find a new entrÃ©e.
- And a coop.
- Sabrina, you gotta help me.
I left the formula on too long.
Sabrina, you've got to help me.
Back of the line, sister.
I asked him about his hobbies, and he started babbling on about pitching and catching, and-- And men in red socks.
Oh, he's talking about baseball.
It's a sport.
Mortal men love it.
Baseball.
Got it.
Come with me.
Wait.
You can't just walk in there with a professional baseball player.
Well, can I shrink him down and put him in my pocket?
Just be honest.
Tell Emil you don't know anything about baseball.
Guys love explaining stuff like that.
It's the only downside.
Excuse me.
Did I get hit in the head with a foul ball or something?
Yeah.
Enjoy the buzz.
Oh.
Go.
Here.
Hold this.
You know, baseball's a game that combines physical prowess with mental discipline.
Kill the chicken.
Harvey, what are you doing here?
Sabrina, I'm putting my foot down.
You're my girlfriend, and I demand you be with me on Valentine's Day.
Your mom decided to go with your dad?
I'll help you babysit.
- That's sweet, Harvey, but I--  It's a wonderful idea.
Marigold.
But the girls are, you know Oh, don't worry.
They'll be little angels if I ask them to be.
How come you never asked them before?
He better be just as cute and sweet when I get back, or I'll give you a wart you'll have to push around in a wheelbarrow.
Watch the blouse.
It's silk.
I'll zap in a Porta-Potti later.
No.
There is no way that Smokey and the Bandit is on the 100 best-movies list.
And I have just about had it with your know-it-all attitude.
Willard, no.
Brute force never solved anything.
Carlton.
His right knee is bad.
One kick and he's down.
So, Waldo, you gonna do anything about it, or are you just gonna whine about it?
Well, normally I would just whine about it, but you have made me really mad.
So shall we split the crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e sampler?
I can't believe I didn't bring any pictures of my boys.
Oh, they're great.
I mean, they're a handful, but I wouldn't trade them.
I'd sell them.
Absolutely delightful.
The couch has got to go.
- What's in your glass?
- Oh, heh, cork.
And it has to go.
Let me fish it out for you.
Oh, thank you.
No one is ever gonna mistake me for Pierre Salinger again.
You know, you are starting to get a little thin on top.
Is dessert almost ready?
I just took the pie out of the oven.
Ten minutes?
Hold this!
Harvey!
- Where's Harvey?
- Right here.
Just as cute and sweet as when you left him.
Harvey!
We changed his name to Cuddles.
Dessert's coming right out.
Oh, no!
Dog!
Oh, no, my pie!
There.
Fixed that wobble.
Change him back!
Time to put Operation: Get This Loser Plumber Out Of Our Lives into action.
This wine is making me feel so warm.
Ah!
Fire!
Fire!
Oh, my God, fire!
Oh, my God, my pants.
Fire.
Oh.
Yeah.
Good, good, good.
Here.
Hey.
I got it, I got it.
I got it, I got it.
Thanks.
Where did that watering can come from?
Uh, this?
Uh, um I'll be right back.
Help.
I'm too young to be a chew toy.
Harvey, heel!
Sabrina, what do I say to Emil?
His chair just-- Marigold, whatever it is, just be yourself and be honest.
Bad dog, Harvey!
Where's Emil?
Hair-clog emergency somewhere?
You two, kitchen, now.
And there's a puddle on the mud porch with your names on it.
Where's Emil?
Help.
Help.
Help.
Well, um Let's get him out and hope he didn't notice.
So, Emil, you were saying?
Who are you people?
Wait, I can explain.
You can?
I mean, of course she can.
Emil, I have to be honest with you.
I'm a witch.
Am I the only one who thinks the salmon mousse has gone a little bad?
Think I'll go now.
Now, who wants decaf?
So where'd you learn to fight like that?
Well, when you grow up playing the zither and loving Doris Day, you get in your share of scrapes.
You're a Doris Day fan?
- Me too.
- No kidding.
Huh.
Marigold, you have to go after Emil.
If he tells anyone you're a witch, you'll be out of the Other Realm and lose your magic.
You'll be mortal, and you'll have to live here.
Come on, woman, move.
I think he made it clear he doesn't wanna see me again.
Fine.
I'll go.
I'm sure he hasn't had a chance to tell anyone.
Unless he has a car phone.
Couple of days in the slammer might teach Carlton to fight a little better.
Oh, we can't just leave them here, Hilda.
It's partially our fault for pitting them against each other.
Really?
I slept the whole time?
It may be time to go back to naps.
Yeah, but I'm wide awake now, and I feel-- Go get it!
Marigold, I'm really sorry about you losing your magic.
I feel responsible.
I just didn't want to pick up trash.
Oh, don't blame yourself, Sabrina.
I'm sure I can learn to cope.
Here.
You just flip the switch.
Dear Lord, what have I done?
Why did I have to turn him into a retriever?
Harvey.
Mr. Andranini?
Emil.
Ahem.
You came back.
I've been driving around the last hour, thinking.
- And talking.
- Yeah.
To my brother.
He, uh, thinks I'm crazy.
I am.
About you.
Wow.
And he's met my children.
I don't understand what happened tonight.
But for some strange reason, I know I wanna keep seeing you.
I'm not going anywhere.
Oh, I just wanna clarify one thing.
Do you have magical powers?
I can honestly say I don't.
Yes!
I did it!
I'm not even gonna ask.
Look.
I did it.
- Marigold and Emil are in love.
- Oh, bully for them.
Oh, see, Sabrina?
That wasn't so hard.
Throw it again.
Throw it again.
You really don't mind losing your magic?
All I can say is I have had magic for hundreds of years, and I have never really been happy.
And now I'm happy.
What's the trick to this?
Why do they have to make it so complicated?
Oh, I almost forgot.
A poorly-cut valentine?
No.
It's your clue to the family secret.
Hey.
You ever tried to use scissors?
Barbaric.
Whoa, tornado in the bathroom?
We never had to get dressed the mortal way before.
Buttons are hard.
Knock, knock.
Four hungry men reporting for duty.
This is, uh, Darryl.
And Angelo.
And you met Robby.
Hi, boys.
I'm Marigold.
And these are my daughters, Amanda and Ally.
Nice shirt.
Button it with your feet?
No.
My fist.
Kids, come on.
Hey.
Can we act like a family here?
Quit saying that.
We're not a family.
Hey.
Now, Robby.
Guys.
Sounds like a real family to me.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
The day is alive with the wonder of Wednesday.
To me, it's just another day with eight nipples.
- What's wrong?
- I can't remember what it was like to be human.
This voice used to bark orders to a legion of mercenaries.
Now it begs two old maids for catnip.
I believe the correct term is "spinsters".
Come on, you big wuss.
Suck it up.
Take it like the man you used to be.
I know what you can't resist.
Your favourite cat toy.
- I don't need your pity.
This is serious.
Usually he thrives on our pity.
Oh, let's go see if he wants his tummy rubbed.
- You coming, Hilda?
- Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It is irresistible.
May I have this slam dance?
Get your peanut-butter dandies here, compliments of the committee to elect Willard Kraft principal.
Here you go.
Tell your folks to vote early and often.
- Is it true Principal Larue is out?
- Well, not yet.
But his contract is up, so I'm throwing my hat in the ring.
Why?
Because I want that extra $418 a year.
With you in charge, the cheerleaders can finally gain power of attorney over the dance fund.
If I can lure enough votes with my dandies.
Here you go, Libby.
Ew.
Maybe if you offered them with milk.
Excellent idea.
Gordie?
Would you get me a few gallons of milk, please?
Oh, but I have violin practice.
Running my errands comes before rock 'n' roll.
So if you don't want to raise your family in detention Has anyone asked you to the St. Patrick's Day dance?
No, but between you and me, there's someone I wish would.
Really?
Let me guess.
Um - Jerry.
- No.
- Pat?
- Sabrina, you aren't gonna get it.
- Jimmy?
- No.
It's Gordie.
Ken?
Look, I've gotten to know him since I started orchestra.
He's sort of the Kevin Costner of the string section.
We have to get him to ask you to the dance.
Well, I've been dropping serious hints, but he hasn't been picking up on them.
Hey, Gordie.
Hey, did you see that St. Patrick's Day dance poster?
You know, Val loves to dance.
In fact, she loves to be asked to dance.
Mr. Kraft needs milk.
See?
You can't be subtle.
A surprise party is just the thing to make Salem forget he's not a man.
I hope his old address book is in there.
It won't be much of a surprise if we're the only guests.
"Universe v. Saberhagen: confiscated personal effects".
Two Ricolas.
One dry-cleaning receipt for a velvet cape.
And no address book.
A sceptre?
This is sad.
What a day.
I was playing matchmaker for Valerie and Gordie, which is like the low-self-esteem Olympics.
And Libby is politicking for that known evil called Willard Kraft.
And yet you're not a cat.
Did I mention I almost choked on a dandy?
Oh, a rainbow.
I hope that doesn't stain.
Faith and begorra.
It's your lover boy.
- Roland, what's with the brogue?
- It's part of my new job.
You know, after a lot of therapy, I finally figured out why you and I never clicked.
- Your personality?
- No.
You're shallow, so I needed a glamorous job to impress you.
So say hello to your dream date, Leprechaun Roland.
- Erin go bragh.
- Erin go back.
Look, Roland, how can I put this without hurting your feelings?
You sicken me.
Hey.
Let's take it slow.
We have the rest of our lives to love each other.
Hey, you wanna give me a leg up here?
Roland.
You're not helping.
In fact, I think you're enjoying this.
Like you're not.
Where are you going?
I'll use the linen closet.
Boy, you're sounding like a ball and chain already.
He's weeping at a Richard Simmons advertisement.
This isn't just an infomercial.
It's info-truth.
Oh, we've gotta find that address book.
GORDIE : This is Gordie, the voice of Westbridge, with an important announcement from Mr. Kraft.
You are cordially invited to a campaign rally to get your parents to vote for Mr. Kraft.
Anyone not attending will be caned by Mr. Kraft.
Well, as long as we don't have to eat any more dandies.
Whoa.
What's this?
"Our secret love will always last.
I'll wait for you over the rainbow.
Lover boy".
- Oh.
- Something you need to tell me?
Stupid junk mail.
Uh, uh, my-- My locker is on every mailing list.
Oh, jeez.
Everybody else sees this, right?
I'll take that.
Thank you.
Roland.
Hey.
- Oh, no.
You've caught me.
- Oh, hey, I caught a leprechaun.
Don't I get a pot of gold and my book bag?
We don't do gold anymore.
But you do get these coupons redeemable for three wishes.
Great.
Well, I know what my first one will be.
I wish Roland would go away.
But, honey-- I just tried on one of my old suits, and I almost suffocated in the sleeve.
Whoa!
Are these wish coupons?
How many?
Three.
Well, two.
I blew one ditching Roland McLeprechaun.
Sabrina, I'll be your best friend if you use a wish to turn me back into a man.
Oh, please, please, please.
Salem, you know I can't use magic to help you regain your human form.
It's a direct violation of the Witches' Council.
Well, one of Roland's coupons wouldn't be your magic.
If anyone found out, it'd be his emerald keister in a sling.
Right.
But the last time you were a man, you tried to take over the world.
No politics.
Promise.
I just wanna remember what it's like to be human.
Please.
- Well - Oh, please.
Roland, I have a wish.
Yes.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
So Salem will enter the body of a student at school so I can keep an eye on him.
Preferably a young Dan Blocker type.
And I'll keep one wish coupon to bring him back.
No problem.
Let's take Salem's essence to school and find a suitable vessel.
Do it.
I wish Salem was human, with all the aforementioned disclaimers.
Next time I lift my hat, Salem enters the nearest body.
But what about the cat?
He's just a regular house cat till Salem returns.
You're loving my new cologne, aren't you?
Oh, hello, Salem.
Listen, we need a good haberdasher.
And since you know so many people who haberdash, would you happen to know where your old address book is?
Did he meow?
"Vote for Mr. Kraft or else".
I thought of that slogan myself.
Sir?
My thumb is really starting to throb.
Oh, stop kissing up and finish the job.
Watch out.
You might cover the St. Patrick's Day dance poster.
That poster.
Hey, Valerie?
- Yes?
- If I use the same tack holes, I might be able to avoid thumb surgery.
Let's pick a vessel to put Salem in.
Well, what's gonna happen to the vessel?
I mean, student?
Once Salem's done with the body, the kid will think he's been home with the mumps.
Duh.
Okay.
Well, let's take our time and choose carefully.
Okay.
I pick that guy.
Gordie, are you aware there's a dance on Friday?
- Roland, wait.
- Gee, Valerie, I--  I'll pick you up at 8.
What kind of flowers do you like?
- Surprise me.
- That means roses.
Sabrina.
I think Gordie just hit puberty.
- Salem?
- Speaking.
Man, standing rocks.
Well, that was really nice of you to ask Valerie out-- Well, to get Gordie to ask Val-- Well, whatever just happened was nice.
Well, I thought I might be of some service while I'm here.
It's just my way of saying thank you, thank you, thank you.
Do you think it's obsessive-compulsive disorder?
A party will bring him back to normal.
Thank goodness you found that address book.
Yeah.
Who would've thought it'd be next to the phone?
I just wish we knew what kind of soiree he would like.
- Let's drop some hints, but be subtle.
- Of course.
Salem, what kind of parties do you like?
- I like luaus.
How about you, Zelda?
- I like parties that are more subtle.
Either we've offended him, or he heard the ice-cream truck.
Stop it.
Oh.
And where are you off to, enchantress of third period?
- English.
- Lucky English.
I better check these books for hidden explosives.
Okay, I'll see you later, Gordie, and don't forget who you're supposed to be.
Identity crisis.
Pep talk.
I'm sorry I got jealous about that love letter.
- I know you had nothing to do with it.
- I have no idea how it got in there.
Or got framed?
Think that commotion's coming from where Valerie and Gordie went to?
Oh, don't worry.
I'll go check for myself.
It's real silver.
You know how often you're gonna have to clean this?
Salem.
I mean, Gordie.
Okay.
Well, uh, "Have a good class" to you too.
- What?
What'd I do?
- You were smooching.
I thought you liked me to cheer Valerie up.
- Not like that.
- I stand corrected.
So the weekend in Vegas is a no-go?
Look, just go to math and be Gordie, or you go back to the litter box.
I'll be good.
Cross my gawky, adolescent heart.
Whew.
Hmm.
High school politics.
What could be more innocent?
I've got it.
Please don't say fox-hunting party again.
Let's cast a spell and crash the best party that Salem ever went to.
Oh, that's great.
Then we can re-create it.
Hair of a dog, a laugh that's hearty, take us to Salem's favourite party.
Well, judging from the debauchery I'd say we're in Ancient Rome.
Either that or it's Super Bowl week.
- Caligula?
- I've been called worse.
Romulus.
Fetch these vixens some fig leaves.
I'll teach them the secret handshake.
I've seen enough.
How about fox hunting?
Is this seat taken?
Yes.
By someone I might be caught dead talking to.
Cute kid.
All right.
The Kraft campaign needs some proven techniques for winning.
As if you'd know any.
Who do you think stuffed the ballots in Chicago that got Kennedy elected?
A lot of dead people voted that yeartwice.
- What?
- Ix-nay on the orruption-cay, capiche?
What is the big idea of you sitting with Libby?
Had to.
Lab partners.
We don't like her, right?
Right.
Now go to math.
What was that all about?
- Oh.
You know, just the usual pithy banter that peppers our school hallways.
You've been hanging out with Gordie an awful lot lately.
Harvey, we're talking about Gordie here.
The letter.
Oh!
I don't think I'm out of line asking for an explanation.
And I have one.
It's just I'm having a hard time remembering one right now.
Is there a problem here, farm boy?
- Because I need to talk to Sabrina.
- What is your cousin doing here?
Updating me on my uncle.
We'll be right back.
- So how's it going with Salem?
- He's fine.
But I have a problem with a jealous boyfriend and your stupid love letter.
- Now, please go away.
- Not without a goodbye kiss.
It's an Irish tradition.
Go.
Just how close a cousin is he?
Do you think we should invite Mary Ann Mobley?
She doesn't get along well with Castro.
Hey.
Thanks for drinking my soda.
What are you talking about?
I've got my own right here.
Hey.
I'm just like Dr Pepper.
So misunderstood.
Caligula, now why on earth would you sneak home with us?
Ew!
- What you looking for?
- I've completely lost track of Gordie.
Yeah, me too.
You know, he's not the guy I thought he was.
I'm pretty sure he tried to play footsie with me in Band.
I'll kill him.
I'm not that upset.
Gordie.
Gordie.
Okay.
I'm not imagining it.
You're calling out Gordie's name in the hall.
- Why are you so interested in him?
- He owes me money?
Would you check the boys' room for me?
- Salem, help.
- Call the cops.
Or just sit there and do nothing.
Gordie's not in this bathroom either, but I did find Mr. Congeniality.
- Hi, cutie.
- Hey.
Have you seen Salem?
Last time I saw him, he was talking to some girl and an old guy in the cafeteria.
Something about how to win an election.
Oh, no.
Politics.
What did you say to her?
None of your milk-fed business, farm boy.
This may not be a family I wanna marry into.
We start by announcing that Principal Larue has gout and a secret family.
- That's brilliant.
- Let the innuendo begin.
With my know-how and your hairline, we don't have to stop at this petty school election.
We could take over the world.
Ha-ha.
Did I say world?
I meant state.
Oh, your biped days are over, cat.
Roland.
Roland.
- Oh, Mr. Leprechaun.
- Aha.
So now it's Mr. Leprechaun.
Wait a minute.
Mr. Leprechaun?
Maybe I put it in my locker.
Okay, now I'm beginning to get suspicious.
Now I remember.
I left the coupon at home.
Aha.
Wait a minute.
What coupon?
Roland?
Where are you?
Oh!
I wish you would get over here.
Your wish is my command.
- Where's the coupon?
- It's gone.
You wished for me to come here, so here I am.
What?
You mean I blew my last wish?
What am I gonna do?
Salem's not only taking over the school, I think he skipped French.
- Now what?
- We're bounty hunters, ma'am.
We're here to catch some lawbreakers.
One black cat-slash-boy, one former emperor of Rome, a Hilda, a Zelda, a Roland-- And a Sabrina.
- Gotta go.
- Get her.
Right this way, and no sudden moves.
I still don't know what I did wrong.
You let Charlie Toga Party exit the Other Realm and his time period.
Last time he got loose, the '60s happened.
Get your hand off my leg.
Oh, this is a great legal atmosphere.
Especially the vomitorium.
Sabrina, I can't believe you thought you would get away with changing Salem.
Although it does explain why I finally beat the cat at Scrabble.
Silence!
The trials begin.
Now, who smuggled this miscreant into the mortal realm?
- We didn't.
- He stowed away.
- Is this true?
- Maybe.
But, Your Honour, speaking man to man, they wanted me.
We find Hilda and Zelda innocent, and Caligula is sentenced to another 100 years of unbridled decadence and nonstop partying.
Same old, same old.
Next case.
Who turned Salem into a human?
Technically Roland the leprechaun did.
But I don't see what the big deal is.
I mean, I'm sure Salem's just hanging around school.
Really?
And so it is with great pride that I announce my plans to run for governor.
If a wrestler can do it, why not a vice principal, huh?
Thank you.
Thank you.
See?
He is at school.
And you say this is Roland's fault.
Right.
Roland granted the wishes, which I didn't ask for, and I should've used on clothes, so isn't he responsible for the results?
- Is that how you really see it?
- Yes.
No.
I'm responsible.
I should have known better.
I just-- I felt so bad for Salem.
All I ask is that the court be lenient, and if possible, please let me skip the orgy.
Sabrina, we find you guilty of releasing a witch familiar, who is wreaking havoc on the world.
But since this is Rome, let's do as the Romans do.
- Speak Latin?
- No.
Throw her to the lions.
Isn't that a little harsh?
Why?
She gets to take that peashooter.
Well, it's something.
Remember, Sabrina, lions can smell fear.
Oh, so bravery will cover the smell of my tender flesh?
Before the carnage begins, ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem.
I hate it when Nero fiddles.
The home team always loses.
Hey.
It's Roland and Salem.
- Oh, thank Zeus.
I'm sorry I ducked out on you.
But I had to talk Charlie Power-monger here out of taking down Microsoft.
I thought I could resist power, but I'm weak.
I didn't wanna hurt you, Sabrina.
I just wanted to rule you.
Your Honour, I'm ready to be a cat again.
Sabrina, once again you've dodged the bullet.
That's the name of the lion: Bullet.
Thank you, guys.
If you'll excuse me now, I think I'm gonna faint.
No.
She does not need mouth-to-mouth.
Another 50 years as a cat.
By the time I work off this extra time, I'll be an old man.
Many people are vital in their later years.
- Look at John Glenn.
- You look at him.
You really should thank Roland for talking you into turning yourself in.
Oh, no thanks needed.
I did it for the love of a good woman.
Oh, so you met someone?
You don't like the leprechaun thing, do you?
That's why I start an exciting new job on Monday.
- Organ donor?
- Bounty hunter.
So let's just hope next time we meet, it's not because there's a price on your head, pretty lady.
Well, I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.
I'm sorry I made you guys stand trial.
I was just trying to give Salem a nice present.
Apology accepted.
We're proud that you took responsibility for your actions.
Now the bad news.
Because of the time change from Rome, it's time for you to go to school.
What?
The sleep I get in school is never as good as the sleep I get in a bed.
Thought I already had the mumps, but it explains a lot.
Especially the low voice and narcissistic tendencies.
I'm just glad you're back to your old self.
Okay, this is hard, so I'm just gonna say it.
Do you wanna go to the Slicery?
- I'd love to.
- Really?
I can't understand why you took such a dive at the polls.
Well, I blame that carrot-top weasel, Gordie.
Mother always said that freckles are the devil's fresco.
Hello, Mr. Kraft.
Here are your detention slips, son.
That ought to keep you occupied through grad school.
Rain check?
- Hey.
- Harvey, listen.
I owe you an apology for being so distracted recently.
It's okay.
It's just nice to talk to you without hundreds of other men vying for your attention.
Sabrina.
I-- Oh.
You romantic, you.
- What?
That's my signature.
- It was you all along.
Surprise.
I think I need a nap.
I recommend the desks in Language Lab.
- Have a nice nap, Zelda.
- You too.
Did we forget something?
Oh, they must be here for Salem's party.
Salem's party.
Okay, don't panic.
Turn on some music.
I'll get some dip.
And the guest of honour.
Oh, hello, Mary Ann Mobley.
And what is Castro doing here?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Toast is up.
That's odd.
We weren't making toast.
Oh, no!
It's a chain letter.
There are no metaphors in the Other Realm, are there?
Other Realm chain letters are the worst.
If we don't immediately send strong iron chains to 20 other people, horrible things will befall us.
Okay, so which of my dearest friends do I hate the most?
Stop right there.
Bad luck is not brought on by silly superstitions like chain letters.
You're right.
They're brought on by black cats.
That is a hateful stereotype.
It's brought on by midgets in dresses.
Give me that.
We are going to throw this chain letter away.
And nothing horrible will happen.
I'm sure this is just a coincidence.
If the in-flight movie's bad, I'm jumping.
A "B"?
What did you get?
A C-minus?
Wow.
This is the first time I ever got a better grade than you.
Yep.
It's my paper.
"Your characters are undeveloped, and your plot seems contrived".
- Of course it's contrived.
I made it up.
- Hey.
I got a C-plus.
What did you get?
She got a C-minus.
Sabrina got a C-minus?
Sabrina, the genius, got a C-minus.
I always feel the minus part is personal.
I've never gotten a C-minus in my whole life.
I gotta talk to Mr. Franco.
And remember to floss.
Mr. Franco, I wanted to talk to you about this C-minus I got.
I'm sure you'll do better next time.
I'm horribly upset about it this time.
I've grown accustomed to getting A's.
They cushion the blow when I get a pimple, or have to climb the rope in gym.
Sabrina, everyone gets a C once in a while, and no one can climb the rope in gym class.
It's there to humiliate people.
I should have trusted my instincts and taken Shop.
Hey.
I gotta get to gym class.
We get to climb the rope today.
So to recap, you have done nothing to respond to this chain letter?
You both held your tongues.
Excellent.
You will find the best way to stop a chain letter is to simply ignore it.
Let's let the professionals track down the culprit and bring him to justice.
You can't lose faith.
Because if I must say so myself, I think all of us are doing a pretty good job.
Ladies.
Oh.
Well, we can't catch everybody, now can we?
Sabrina, is something bothering you?
You look like I do when I've accidentally eaten apricots.
Your larynx hasn't collapsed, has it?
No.
I'm just working on this story.
I got a C-minus on the last one.
I heard.
I'm working hard to prove it was an aberration.
Oh, then, I'm sure this one is wonderful.
Let me hear some.
Okay.
Well, it's supposed to be a genre piece, so I picked romance.
"Clare looked at Robert, and Robert looked at Clare.
Clare and Robert were looking at each other.
Clare didn't wanna fall in love, but nothing in her crazy life made sense and she lost all feeling in her thumbs".
You don't have to be good at everything.
Well, if it isn't "C-brina".
Perhaps you can improve your grades by studying in detention.
Detention?
What did I do?
Even John Grisham has to pick up his trash.
Missy?
Or should I say, Miss-C Minus?
More sugar for your tea?
This is more awkward than when we had lunch with the Elephant Man.
Please let me send the chain letters and get rid of these annoying curses.
No.
We are taking the postmaster's advice and not giving in.
Fine.
Then get your big, fat hand out of my way.
You get your big, fat hand out of my way.
- Oh!
Oh.
- Ow!
You broke my big, fat nail.
Hey, shouldn't you be working on your story?
I'm trying to find some stupid inspiration to write my stupid story.
I recommended she watch this spy movie.
Is this movie helping you at all?
Well, so far, it's about a very handsome spy who drives a sports car with machine guns in the headlights, beautiful women, an evil scientist with an eye patch, more beautiful women, and a plot to corner the uranium market.
But I'm only ten minutes in.
Maybe you'd be more inspired if you had the classic accoutrements of a writer.
Gin, night sweats and a bad marriage?
I was talking about my old manual typewriter.
It always used to inspire me when I was in college.
I think it's still up in the attic.
Well, I'll try anything.
Beats sitting around here with Salem yelling, "Bring it on, baby," every time there's a woman on the screen.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
Hopefully, a well-written nothing.
Let's see.
"International spy, Derek Kink, has been given the assignment of stopping" I need a villain.
"Dr. Bad".
I'll fix that later.
Uh "An evil scientist bent on taking over the world".
Ha.
I'm good.
Wow.
Soon, my face will be on the side of Barnes & Noble bags.
Hilda!
- Go away.
I am mailing these chain letters tonight and getting rid of these wolf ears.
- No.
- Yes.
Where were we?
- Yes!
Yes!
- No!
No!
I aced my story.
I just know it.
I might have blown mine.
I wrote a techno-thriller, but I set it in the '20s.
C?
But that's impossible.
I typed it on a manual typewriter.
The same kind William Faulkner used when he wasn't passed out drunk on the veranda.
If it makes you feel any better, I've gotten so many Cs, my next one's free.
And if it makes you feel any worse, I got a B. Can I talk to you about this?
Sure.
I thought this story was better, but it had some of the same problems as the first one.
Even though the spy genre was a good choice, the characters didn't seem real.
Didn't seem real?
But I based them all on real people.
I mean, come on, Dr. Bad, an evil scientist who kills teenagers with detention slips of death.
Sound like a certain "Krafty" vice principal?
You give much thought to that name, "Dr. Bad"?
W-- And-- And "Derek Kink"?
Harvey Kinkle.
I mean, it was practically nonfiction.
That's not character development.
A good writer knows everything about her characters: their history, their strengths and weaknesses, and what motivates them.
I put it in a nice binder.
Shirt untucked.
I drew straight from life.
Dr. Bad?
Here's your detention slip of death.
Oh, no.
My characters have come to life.
And that means that student's about to die.
All I did was wear my skates to school.
And Mr. Franco said that my characters weren't real.
I've gotta stop Dr. Bad.
Ah, Lydia.
Lydia Kissenkill, my favourite double agent.
And this is my newest weapon: The pom bomb.
A cheerleader tosses it at someone, say, a spy, and then: rah-rah, sis-boom.
Oh, dear.
His head came off.
- Oh.
- Hee-hee.
It's marvellous what they can do with a little crepe paper and plastic explosives.
- Oh!
- About your crashing GPA.
There's an enrichment program for remedial students.
They have chocolate milk.
And once a year, they take a trip to the zoo.
How did magic get into my story?
I have to get home and talk to my aunts.
- Valerie.
- Vivian.
Oh, right.
Vivian Soontodie, the beautiful agent who works with Derek Kink.
And UNICEF.
- We have to meet Derek.
- Love to, but I have to get home.
I have a black belt in 24 disciplines of Oriental martial arts.
Then clearly, I'm coming with you.
- Harvey?
- Kink's the name.
Derek Kink.
Of the European Special Service.
Pineapple smoothie?
Derek, we have to get to our briefing.
- Right.
- And I have to get home.
Hey, you're making me spill my smoothie.
Mrs. Doohickey.
No time for niceties, Kink.
We have the special equipment you'll be needing for this assignment.
These seemingly innocent-looking erasers when clapped together emit a poisonous gas.
Chalk up another success.
Fortunately, the effects are only temporary.
Well, good luck with your weapons and poison.
I'll just toddle along.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
That last scream really cleared up my sinuses.
Are you going to lunch?
Can't.
I gotta go home and figure out-- Why I forgot my lunch.
I don't like this show.
Do you have the remote?
No.
I foolishly forgot to pick it up before I unexpectedly grew 8 feet.
I'm going to blame the altitude for your rudeness.
The characters in my story are alive.
Thank goodness my home can be a shelter from the madness.
Sabrina, could you speak up?
It's hard to hear you from up here.
The people in my spy story came to life and they're running around my school.
The only way that could happen is if you accidentally used Hilda's magic typewriter, but she got rid of that years ago, didn't you, Hilda?
By "get rid of," you don't mean "kept," do you?
Hilda.
- I'm sorry.
I know I was supposed to give it away, but I love writing romance stories with myself as the heroine, and then watching them come to life.
It isn't pathetic, is it?
Can we come up with a solution?
There's a group of spies running around my school.
And my neck is killing me.
Oh, dear.
What kind of an ending did you write for your story?
Well, it was late, and I was really tired, so I just had Dr. Bad When this bomb goes off, all the teenagers will be annihilated, and everyone will think they were killed in a science lab experiment gone terribly awry.
Dr. Bad, you are a genius.
An evil genius.
I had him blow up the school.
When working with a magic typewriter, you can never let your characters die.
Well, I didn't know I was working with a magic typewriter.
Right.
Sorry.
The problem is, when your characters die, their real-life counterparts also die.
Oh.
And I just spent the last two years foolishly making friends.
I suggest you go up to your room and rewrite that ending.
Don't worry.
We'll help you.
How do you plan for us to get upstairs?
There.
See?
Man, there are a lot of Frisbees on the roof.
I've got the ending.
Dr. Bad is about to blow up the school, but then decides not to.
Oh, honey, you can't just force the ending.
It has to come from the character's history, motivated by their strengths and weaknesses.
That's the same thing Mr. Franco said, and I still find it annoying.
But the good news is, if you find the right ending, it practically writes itself.
What is my bra doing on the roof?
Uh, the squirrels need a nut feeder.
Sabrina, we can help you write a new ending.
Try this.
Dr. Bad has captured Derek and tied him to a buzz saw.
There's always been an unpleasant edge to you, Dr. Bad.
I am killing you just to stop the puns.
Suddenly, Dr. Bad turns to Lydia and says Turn off the saw.
- Why?
- Why?
Well, the way the courts have been cracking down on evil geniuses lately, it wouldn't be practical for me to kill him.
I'd end up having to pay a legion of lawyers, which I'm sure would just wipe out my entire retirement plan.
That's a terrible ending.
I thought it was very contemporary.
You have to come up with a believable ending, or your characters will reject it.
What am I saying?
Turn the saw back on!
Fictional characters can be such prima donnas.
Can we get back to the ticking bomb that's gonna vaporise my friends?
Not to mention the only candy machine in town that has Nutrageous bars.
Right.
Try this.
As the other characters look on helplessly, Derek Kink and Dr. Bad are locked in a fight to the death.
Yes, I have found a worthy opponent in you, Kink.
Much too worthy to kill.
How about a square dance instead?
Delightful.
What?
That's a much worse ending than mine.
It's an unexpected twist.
Who are you people to judge my art?
No wonder I'm no good.
Look at my gene pool.
A cat could write a better ending than that.
And will, if you start typing.
Kink had surprised Dr. Bad You're through, Dr. Bad.
I-- I-- I would like to ask you to square dance.
Salem.
- Okay.
I froze.
Uh-oh.
We're changing again.
Whoa.
Had to plant rosebushes under Sabrina's window.
I figured something out.
- Oh, the ending?
- No.
I've figured out I'm no writer, I'm a doer.
So I'm gonna go back to school and solve this thing myself, in person.
There's a little something on your teeth, Zelly.
Hey.
No spots.
No wings.
No webbed feet.
Hilda, we've beaten the chain letter.
I knew I was right to hold out against that silly superstition.
Actually, I sent out I was not going to apply mascara to my six new eyes.
Oh, well, I have to admit it's kind of a relief to be normal again.
I liked being taller though.
I know.
You can wear anything when you're tall.
They're loose in the school again.
I've gotta somehow get them together and disarm the bomb.
Vivian!
- Where's Derek?
- Huh?
Wouldn't a laptop computer be more convenient?
Still can't work Windows 95.
Gotta go.
If I'm her weird friend, I must be really weird.
Excuse me.
Even the head cheerleader can't be in the hallway without a pass.
Okay.
I am having a heart attack, and I have to fill out a form for the hole.
Talk about a glamour don't.
Cat suits went out six years ago.
Hyah!
I wouldn't start any long books if I were you.
Oh, no.
Uh "Dr. Bad's wheelchair started spinning out of control like--" Whoa!
"Like a wheelchair spinning out of control".
Run, Harvey.
Why couldn't it have been a magic legal pad?
Mrs. Quick.
Mrs. Quick.
Have you seen Libby Chessler?
She brought some sort of lethal laser device to school today and nearly killed me.
Huh?
Harvey, have you seen Sabrina?
She's acting-- Is there an afternoon prom that nobody asked me to?
Lydia.
Okay, that was weird.
All right.
Don't start whimpering until you get to your office.
Don't start whimpering until you get to your office.
Oh, Mrs. Quick.
I mean, Mrs. Doohickey.
- Have you seen Derek?
- Who wants to know?
Will you hold this a second?
"A mysterious blond spy asks Mrs. Doohickey for help in locating Derek Kink.
Mrs. Doohickey leads her to him".
Follow me.
Next time, write that Mrs. Doohickey carries the typewriter.
- Don't hurt me.
Oh, God.
- Mr. Kraft.
- Why are you acting like a freshman?
- Because-- You're not armed?
- In that case, you are suspended.
- What?
- Yes.
- Valerie needs to be suspended.
She kicked me.
Well, that-- That would explain your strange behaviour.
Miss Birkhead fries.
Come on.
Huh!
Oh, dear.
Substitute teacher.
I don't think she looks like you at all.
The psychic was right.
I was separated at birth.
Ah!
Keep her away from me.
She has poison chalk dust.
I don't even have gum.
What is going on at this school today?
Oh, it's a pretty normal day.
Although, I did learn I have an exact duplicate.
She just ran down the hall with Sabrina.
You know, every time anything strange happens around this school, the trail always leads to Sabrina.
Or to janitor Bob.
But we know that Sabrina is still in the country.
Come on.
Derek.
Dr. Bad has planted a bomb.
An explosive situation.
- I know where it is.
Come with me.
- Dynamite idea.
And you can cool it with the puns.
Look, what happened between us was wrong.
Sabrina's my best friend, and you're her boyfriend, and-- - When did you change your clothes?
- Couple days ago?
Miss Birkhead, I am suspending you for attacking Libby.
- What?
- When did you change your clothes?
What did you do with your wheelchair?
- What?
- Oh, look.
There's Sabrina.
Who's that with her?
Someone who looks like-- Harvey?
- And you?
And me.
Hi!
I could've been pulling down But no, I had to teach.
Okay.
- Turn it off.
- Delighted.
What's the procedure here, Mrs. Doohickey?
I only make things blow up.
I don't know how to stop them from blowing up.
I don't know which wire to cut.
Oh, no.
My characters don't know what to do.
They don't know why they're doing what they're doing.
Character development.
Okay.
"Derek Kink's father wanted him to go into the family business: corn.
But Kink loved science.
Against his family's wishes, he joined the Bomb Disposal Unit of the FBI".
Does anyone have a pair of 178-millimetre insulated wire cutters?
I believe you are all my prisoners.
You don't understand.
There's only a few seconds left.
If Derek doesn't disarm the bomb, we're all gonna die.
Then we will all die together.
Sabrina Spellman, this is Mr. Kraft.
Come out with your hands behind your head.
Don't move.
Come on, Kinkle.
A separated shoulder won't hurt.
DR.
Hey!
The wire.
The wire.
I've got it.
This is all going on your permanent record, young lady.
"The end".
Three weeks' detention, starting this afternoon.
Another happy ending.
So I saved the school from blowing up, and I rewrote my story in detention.
Teacher gave me a B-minus.
It's not an A, but it's not a C either.
I always feel the minus part is personal.
I'm just glad you realised that because you're not great at something doesn't mean you can't learn from it and have fun with it.
That's what I always say about dating.
But I never learn anything, and I don't have fun.
Wait a minute.
So you're saying I'm not a great writer?
Well You see  Oh, my.
There's toast.
Oh, it's from the Other Realm postmaster.
He says they caught the person who started that chain letter, and he's been dealt with accordingly.
Good.
What kind of a foul fiend would abuse the mails?
- I was just reaching out to people.
Oh, dear.
The postmaster also says that because we sent chain letters ourselves, we have to be punished too.
But--  I loved you in The Wizard of Oz.
Fly.
Fly.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Salem, look at this old photograph I found in the attic.
Photos?
I was framed, I tell you.
How was I supposed to know she was married?
It's not of you, it's of some creepy, old relative.
She can help me figure out the family secret so I can finally get my witch's license.
Hi, I'm Sabrina.
I'm sorry to bother you, but I was trying to figure out the family secret, and I was wondering if you knew it.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but while your Uncle Rupert was in prison for embezzling, his wife was having an affair with Rupert's brother, Sinclair.
- But the explosion wasn't his fault-- - Whoa.
So the Spellmans aren't the boring, pathetic losers they've been made out to be?
Good morning, Sabrina and Sabrina's oddly-dressed friend.
I've told you, when they come to the door, just take the pamphlet and smile.
Don't let them in.
Don't you know who this is?
You found the stuff I bought at the flea market yesterday.
A complete stranger--  She doesn't have to be.
Hello.
--who's now going to sue us.
Tonight's show is full of belly laughs.
Ooh.
Sabrina, aren't you afraid if you keep studying for this Brainbusters competition, your whole head's gonna explode?
Don't want to embarrass myself on Saturday in front of the entire school.
Must be a horrible feeling to look like an idiot in front of an auditorium full of people.
Not that that would happen.
- Cheese puff?
- Oh, I'd love one.
Are they hiding underneath those things?
My contributions to my cheerleader bake sale, and nobody's buying them.
Come on, Birkhead.
Move some merchandise, or you'll be spit-shining my pom-poms.
Ooh.
Are they supposed to smell like feet?
You smell it too?
Help.
It's all in the marketing.
Have a cheese puff.
It'll freshen your breath, whiten your teeth, and clear up your acne.
The public's so gullible.
Our neighbour, Mr. Tobias, is the most infuriating man on the planet.
He ran over our trash can again.
That was my favourite trash can.
You can't buy memories like that.
That's not the trash can I was thinking of.
I am sick of his behaviour, and I'm not gonna take it anymore.
Let's destroy everything that's dear to him.
Let's indoctrinate him into the cathedral of agony.
I'm gonna write him a very stern letter.
You're a regular Mad Max, aren't you?
Hilda, what are you doing?
Isn't she a pip?
I bought it at a yard sale for 75 cents.
And they threw in this cool farmer's hat.
Why do you insist on cluttering up our house with useless junk from flea markets?
Junk?
You're the one who bought Sabrina those encyclopaedias.
Until you can prove to me that you can actually use thismonstrosity-- I'm using it right now.
I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?
Cheese actually makes you appear taller.
Okay.
Places, Brainbusters.
This is not the food court at the mall.
Okay, "The Dordogne river meets the sea at which port city in France"?
- Sheldon.
- Bordeaux Yes.
"The cluster of stars in the constellation Orion".
- Sabrina?
- The seven sisters.
Wrong.
Oh, correct.
Ahem.
"Define Newton's theory of gravitational force".
Perry.
Yes, that's what it is, but I need it in words.
"Neanderthals lived in Europe during what period," Maggie?
Look out.
Coming through.
I don't mean to be an alarmist, but shouldn't we wear HAZMAT suits?
It's food poisoning.
Or should I say puff poisoning?
They're all going to be laid up for a week thanks to you and your accomplice Valerie "Sweeney Todd" Birkhead.
Valerie would never wish kidney failure on anyone.
Well, I'm not blaming Valerie.
I'm blaming you.
You've tried to sabotage this competition, because you know how important it is to my career.
You don't want to see me - make principal.
- However true that statement is, - I had nothing-- - Ah.
But it's not going to work, young lady, and I am holding you responsible for having another team ready by Saturday.
And if you don't, you're going to see my ugly side.
You mean it gets uglier?
Yes, I know it's tough competition, Gordie.
Yeah, it's Saturday morning.
Yeah, I know we don't have much time to prepare, but I think it'll be fun.
Hello?
Great.
I've called everyone on the honour roll, in the Science Club, and all the students that wear glasses.
Now what, Aunt Hilda?
You know, I'm sorry, Sabrina.
I'd love to help you, but I've got to go flip the mattresses.
No.
Well, come on.
Valerie, you have to be a Brainbuster.
This whole nightmare can be traced back to your mixing bowl.
No, but I freeze under pressure.
I get dizzy, I sweat profusely, and I babble incoherently.
Much like I'm doing now.
Harvey, you have to do it.
You're my boyfriend.
Ha.
Sure, you say that now.
Wait till they ask me a question I don't know.
Then all of a sudden it's "who brought the dumb guy"?
Look, I really need your help.
Okay, okay.
You guilted us into it.
Don't we need one more?
Unfortunately.
You want me to do you a favour?
What's the sudden fascination with pronouns?
I don't know if you were recently hit in the head with an asteroid, but the day that I do a freak a favour-- Is everything okay here, ladies?
We're fine.
Libby just volunteered to be a Brainbuster, but I don't know if that's a good idea.
- But I-- I-- - I think it's a splendid idea.
If Libby wants to be on the team, then she's on it.
Darn it, Libby.
You get your way again.
Heh-heh-heh.
Mr. Tobias responded to my perfectly reasonable and rational letter by doing this.
A hunk of metal?
He shouldn't have.
No, it's our mailbox.
Well, I have two words for Mr. Tobias: water balloons, aimed at his house, on the hour, every hour.
I realize that's more than two words.
No, Salem, I refuse to stoop to that Neanderthal's level.
Quick, I need a spell to help fill Harvey, Valerie, and Libby's brains with, well, brains.
Sabrina, you know spells to make people smarter are illegal.
Well, it's not that they're stupid-- Except maybe Libby.
--it's just that they lack confidence.
Except maybe Libby.
Is there a spell that would help them tap into the knowledge they already have?
There's a "find your full potential" spell, and it's okay to use on mortals.
Witness Mark McGwire.
- Perfect.
- But there's a catch: you need your witch's license.
But I can't get my stupid license until I figure out the stupid family secret.
I don't believe it.
Tobias is spying on us with a telescope.
Some people have no moral compass.
Salem, you gotta help me.
I've got to get my license.
Don't you know anything about the family secret?
Sabrina, you know what you could do for me?
Order this water-balloon catapult from Abercrombie & Witch.
No.
Isn't there some distant relative nobody ever talks about?
You know, like, the black sheep?
Hmm.
Well, there is your Aunt Dorma.
Dorma?
I've never heard of her.
Hence the secret part.
Yes!
Tobias and the paper just headed into the loo.
That should give me enough time to TP his house.
Aunt Dorma, Pick up your crystal ball Reverse the charges On this call DORMA : Who is this?
I was sound asleep.
It's Sabrina Spellman, your niece.
Sorry to bother you.
I wanted to ask you a question about the family secret.
No one wakes up Dorma and gets away with it.
- You'll rue the day you-- - Sorry, wrong number.
Well, I really hope her crystal ball doesn't have star-69.
Is the family secret about Aunt Dorma?
Absolutely not.
And don't contact her.
She sleeps for 10 years at a time.
The last thing you'd ever want to do is wake her up.
I did once, and she turned me into a porch swing.
Promise me you won't go to your room and call her.
I promise.
Okay.
"The first woman to be elected to both the house and the senate".
- Oh, that's-- - Somebody else besides the queen of the lucky guesses?
- Anyone?
- Oh.
Oh, I know this one!
- Yes, Miss Birkhead.
- Oh, don't tell me.
Um Mr. Kinkle?
Can I just drop and give you 20?
- Libby.
- I told you I'm only here to field - the fashion and hair questions.
Oh!
No.
Just a second.
The answer is Margaret Chase Smith.
Really?
I didn't know that.
Well, this is an unmitigated disaster.
Miss Spellman, you will have plenty of time to think about what you have done to me in detention.
Oh, no, no.
It's going to be fine.
I promise.
All we need to do is have an all-night cram session at my house.
Heh.
They just need to study a little.
Aunt Hilda, Aunt Zelda.
I'm having some people over to study.
Do we have any--?
Snacks.
Aunt Hilda?
Are you all right?
Aunt Hilda?
Come on, wake up.
Rise and shine.
Look, a garage sale!
Poppies?
They're for me, from Aunt Dorma.
Something tells me this is not the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Aunt Zelda, we've got a huge problem.
- Poppies.
- Huh-- - What's happening?
- Where did you get those flowers?
Other Realm poppies are lethal to Spellmans.
- Aunt Dorma!
- You didn't wake her up, did you?
Yes, I woke her up.
Now help me get Aunt Zelda to the couch.
Sure.
I'll grab her shoe.
Just wanted to have some people over to study.
A few minutes ago, my biggest worry was that we didn't have enough pizza rolls.
But no.
Some crazy aunt sends a bunch of-- Poppies!
I got to get rid of them.
Oh, no.
Dorma must have put a spell on my finger so I can't zap the poppies away.
What am I gonna do?
Of course.
Wait two seconds for things to get even worse.
We don't want any cookies.
Religious reasons.
Do you mind?
We're supposed to be studying, not standing out here on your doormat, which, by the way, feels cheap.
You'll have to go around back.
The door is stuck, this is as far as I can get it open.
I've got an idea.
What if the three of us push on--?
You want a war, Tobias?
You got one.
Just put your head between your legs and kiss your sweet little-- Hey!
I don't hang up the phone on you when you're threatening complete strangers.
You've gotta help me.
What else do you remember about poison poppy spells?
Let's see.
From what I remember, you have to remove the poppies from the house, or everyone affected by them will sleep for eternity while their minds and bodies rot slowly into nothingness.
But I can't.
Every time I try my finger just makes more poppies.
Hmm.
That's a twist.
But if you can keep Hilda and Zelda moving, you can delay the decaying process.
How am I supposed to do that?
- Wait a second.
I'm falling asleep too.
- Don't worry.
You're half mortal.
They'll probably just make you drowsy for a few hundred years.
Oh, good.
I was afraid it was something serious.
Sabrina, I can't believe I'm saying this: let me into your house.
What's with all the poppies?
- Our greenhouse broke.
- You have a greenhouse?
Did you guys come over to study or to ask questions?
We certainly didn't come here to socialize.
Can we please go into the living room and get this over with?
Oh, no.
We can't go in there.
The pipes burst and the place is flooded.
Oh, I think I speak for all of us: Ew.
You guys stay here and study and I'll be back before you can say "rampant mildew".
Okay.
I've got to keep Aunt Hilda and Aunt Zelda moving.
To keep my aunts from Spending an eternity in bed Make them act out what's currently Going through their heads Finally, I got past the doorman at Studio 54.
I'm almost across the channel.
I can see Calais.
This is what they dream of?
It's a wonder I turned out normal at all.
What was I doing?
Right!
Hey, Sabrina, we need your help.
Maybe you should spend less time talking and more time studying.
Take that, Tobias.
Ooh.
Stained glass window.
Expensive.
Salem, what are you doing?
Why aren't you helping me?
Bigger fish to fry.
Isn't she a beaut?
Zelda was asleep so I borrowed her credit card.
There's got to be something in here about getting rid of poppies.
Let's see.
"Paprika, uses of".
No.
"Pod people, humour of".
No.
- Salem!
- Don't hate me.
I only did it because I love you.
Ah.
Here it is.
"Poppy cleanup.
Press here for fast, efficient, friendly service".
Finally.
Something easy.
Can't they eat any faster?
Oh, yeah, well, we just came from a job at a garbage dump and they're kind of full.
Sabrina.
Mr. Kraft, what are you doing here?
I just came by to make sure you were studying.
Why do I feel like I just walked into the middle of a Fellini film?
You are a wonderful dancer, Mr. Warhol.
Where are my notes?
I've got to give a lecture in ten minutes.
- Zelda--  Oh, don't mind her.
She's just experiencing a bit of dementia.
All that research.
And for what?
Oh, I understand.
This is one of your experiments.
My pants.
My pants?
Where are my pants?
You are wearing them.
You know, you really are overworking yourself.
Now, my advice to you?
Start taking care of Zelda.
Great suggestion.
We've got to get back to studying now.
Thanks for coming by.
Take that, Tobias.
Hey.
Sabrina, is it okay to come out now?
Harvey, no, you'll ruin your shoes.
Okay, boys.
Take five.
It's a union thing.
Just get the goats out of here.
I'll get rid of the poppies myself.
And people wonder why shepherds are loners.
Hey, what's going on?
We heard some strange noises in there.
- It sounded like goats.
- Goats.
Ha-ha.
You guys have been studying too long.
Come on, goats.
Time to go home.
So how's the studying going?
- Miserably.
- Will you help us?
You don't need me.
You got everything.
- You're smart and you have books.
- So you're not going to help us.
I would, but I just have more work to do, you know, mostly mopping.
But don't leave this room.
I despise this house.
I can't believe this.
I'm drowsy and I'm operating heavy machinery.
Ah.
I beat you, Aunt Dorma.
I won.
Oh, the poppies are back.
I stayed up all night and the poppies are back.
Sabrina?
It's me, Valerie.
Are you okay?
Valerie, hi.
Oh, and Libby's here.
I wonder if Libby's ticklish.
Libby, are you ticklish?
Poor thing.
She must be exhausted from cleaning up all night.
Well, she didn't do a very good job.
It still smells like mildew.
She can't go to the competition in this condition.
I can so.
Actually, I can't sew, but I can knit.
All right, help me get her into my car.
Maybe she'll perk up on the ride to school.
Oh, it's freezing out there.
Hey, Libby, grab her coat, will you?
Welcome, everyone, to the 1999 All City Brainbusters Championship.
Woo!
- Are you sure you can do this?
- Positively.
No problemo.
Fire those questions at me, Willard.
The first round will begin in just a minute.
What is going on over here?
Sabrina's just a little punchy from staying up all night.
Rodgers and Hart.
To get to the other side.
Put duct tape over her mouth if you have to, but keep her quiet.
All right, Westbridge.
"What is Newton's third law of motion"?
I don't know that.
She didn't know that.
Westbridge, "The capital of Madagascar is--"?
Snow!
Incorrect.
No, I'm not.
Snow will get rid of poppies.
Why didn't I think of it before?
It's like The Wizard of Oz.
Heh.
To wake my aunts From terrible rot Send snow to my house Make sure it's a lot The score is Revere, 50, Westbridge, bupkis.
Next question, Westbridge.
"What is the highest peak in North America"?
Great.
I guess it's up to us now that Freak Van Winkle's out cold.
- Valerie, you answer.
- Me?
No way, you answer it.
No way.
Westbridge, we are waiting.
What is the highest peak in North America?
Mount McKinley?
My Lord, that's right.
Ten points for Westbridge.
I don't even know if I'm saying this right.
Is it the Pythagorean theorem?
It is, and that's ten more points for Westbridge.
And the moderator is neutral, of course.
The Pyrenees mountain range extends from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean Sea.
- It certainly does.
- Yes!
All right.
This is your last question, Westbridge.
For the game.
"What country is the largest producer of soybeans"?
- I know it!
- America.
You are correct.
Westbridge wins!
I can't believe it.
Studying actually works.
Sorry about that, Sabrina.
I just couldn't risk it.
What were you gonna say?
You got a purty mouth.
No, no.
You can come by my house and see it any time you want.
Just call first.
I won.
I won.
I'm gonna be principal In 10 or 15 years Ha-ha!
Nobody takes a trophy away from me.
Oh, my goodness.
Is she all right?
She's fine, just exhausted.
What a night.
Between helping us study and the flood in your living room, which is now covered in snow I got a toboggan for my birthday and I couldn't wait to try it.
Freak begets freak.
When she wakes up, will you tell her we won the Brainbusters?
Yeah.
She convinced us to study.
This trophy belongs to her.
You know Sabrina.
Heh.
One crazy idea after another.
Is there a Zelda Spellman at this residence?
Yes.
May I help you?
You're under arrest for making threatening calls to your neighbour and breaking all of his windows with water balloons.
But-- But-- But I've been asleep for the last 12 hours.
You might want to work on that alibi.
Somebody's gonna regret this.
Hmm.
I think she was talking to you.
Break time's over, Salem.
Please don't make me scrub any more toilets.
I keep falling in.
Sabrina, this is your Aunt Dorma.
You really are a black sheep.
So are you here for a social visit, or to poison us in person?
To apologize and to thank you for waking me up.
I left my oven on, and if it weren't for you, my house would have caught on fire.
And as a way of saying she's sorry, we'll get a lifetime supply of mittens.
Oh, and how about a clue to the family secret?
Certainly.
What are barn animal relatives for?
Birds?
It's bad enough trying to figure out these clues.
Nobody said anything about having to clean up after them.
Oh, Salem?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey, look at all the stuff from the Other Realm.
Hey, I got a letter from my pen pal Martha.
This is for you from the Witches' Council accounting office.
And our Christmas presents from Mom.
- But Christmas was four months ago.
- Yeah, she's early this year.
This is wonderful.
They made a clerical error.
I thought I had six lives left, but it turns out I have nine.
That seems fair.
You have nine, Mother Teresa got the one.
This means I can start living more dangerously.
Hello, X Games.
What did you get?
A locket with a tiny nuclear reactor inside.
What did you get?
A gift certificate for ball bearings.
Really?
Yeah, but it's actually quite personal.
She filled it in herself in her lovely chicken scratch.
Martha wants me to visit.
Would that be okay?
No.
I don't want to be the only miserable person in the room.
Of course you can.
Hooray, the toast is stuck.
Danger, here I come.
Careful.
You might touch a coil--  Are you all right?
Fine.
For an appliance.
Great.
You burnt my toast.
I find this the only acceptable form of dribbling.
What happened to Mr. Kraft's office?
Some kids filled his desk up with manure again.
- Happy anniversary.
- What?
Well, it was two years ago today that I saw you across a crowded hallway and felt a twinge in my heart.
And then you hit me on the head with a football.
I wasn't as smooth when I was a freshman.
- Is this a--?
- Yup.
It's a genuine diamond chip.
- Pretty smooth, huh?
- I'll keep it forever.
Spellman, Kinkle, into the cafeteria for fingerprinting.
Are you sure you know how to fingerprint?
Yeah, should ink burn?
Just last night I completed a private detective course as evidenced by this emerald graduation tie clip.
- "Dick".
- That's right, mister.
And I'm using my newfound techniques to get to the bottom of this school's vandalism problem.
From now on, nothing gets by Willard Kraft, PI.
Wow, Martha, what a beautiful library you've got here.
- Martha?
Oh, um Well, actually the library belongs to the Association of Other Realm Book Borrowers.
I'm-- Heh.
I'm just merely one of the minions.
Boy, brag, brag, brag.
You know, you are so funny.
When I read your letters sometimes I laugh so hard, I make a sound.
Well, then you're gonna love my syndicated column.
You've gotta come visit me.
You've gotta meet my friends and family and teach them a thing or two about appreciating my jokes.
Oh, I-- I'm not allowed in the mortal realm.
I'm a magic-free witch.
I was too timid to use my powers and so the Witches' Council took them away.
Oh, the old use-them-or-lose-them law?
Yeah, if I tried to go back with you, then they would just stop us at the border.
You know, you could turn me into something small and then smuggle me back.
I mean, they never check carryons.
Well, but that would be too much trouble.
No.
No trouble at all.
Would you rather be a duty-free bottle of scotch or a pet?
Oh, could I be a cat?
Hey, you're the one riding in the bag.
Hilda, look.
With the added power of Mother's nuclear necklace, I'll finally be able to save time in a bottle.
Oh, that's great.
I found a use for my gift too.
Coaster.
Okay, Sabrina, light my fire.
Salem, I'm not gonna launch you.
The neighbours think we're weird already.
How am I gonna use up some lives if you people continue to be hung up on this thou-shalt-not-kill kick?
Say hi to my pen pal, Martha.
Oh, sharing your secrets with a cat?
What a change of pace for you.
Hey.
Your finger's suffering a little jet lag.
It'll be fine in a few hours.
Now, if you don't mind, expose me to a virus.
Sorry, Martha.
We'll try again in the morning.
I'm not coughing up blood.
Aw.
You look so comfortable there.
And you didn't attack my feet at all during the night.
Wow, talk about your good night's sleep.
Oh.
Oh, my.
I-- Oh.
Well, it-- It must be all that-- That nervous grooming that I did.
That black cat kept trying to goad me into a knife fight.
Well, what do you say I get dressed and we go see a mortal high school?
Oh, you-- You didn't tell me there were gonna be other people here.
Oh, well, I thought the term "public high school" implied that.
Oh, Harvey, meet Martha, my pen pal.
Nice to meet you, Martha.
Where are you from?
The Other Realm.
Drive.
The Other Realm Drive.
It's in Virginia.
Did you show her the necklace?
Oh, right.
Martha, look what Harvey gave me.
- Where is it?
- It's right-- Freeze.
I'll be right back.
I can't find that necklace anywhere.
What am I gonna tell Harvey?
It's at home.
Oh, Spellman, let me guess, your friend doesn't have a visitor's pass.
No, but before society breaks down completely, I can go get one.
Come on, Martha.
Oh, no.
I-- I'm just feeling a little bit overwhelmed.
I'm going to huddle by the water fountain, if you don't mind.
Virginians don't get out much, do they?
Go on to class.
- I will escort your guest to the office.
- But--  Smell that?
It's the odour of detention.
Are we nearsighted, miss?
- Oh, my, my.
- Hmm.
Is that an emerald tie clip or--?
Or am I just fixating on your eyes?
Please.
No.
You are not alligator wrestling in my living room.
I don't care how many lives you have, I don't have time to pick up cat entrails out of the carpet.
Well, I did it.
I finally settled things with Mother.
Oh, Hilda, I'm so glad you talked to her.
Who talked?
I filled her living room with 2 tons of cracked corn.
Out of my way.
Mr. Kraft, where's Martha?
- Oh, that is a very good question.
We were enjoying a skim milk in my office and she stepped out to freshen up.
Next thing I know, the door is locked, no one is heeding my screams for help, and I had to crawl out through an air duct.
I better go find her.
She's not very good in new places.
In case you haven't noticed, she's shy.
Shy?
Ha.
That woman is a brazen--  Wait a minute.
My emerald tie pin.
It's gone.
Call the police.
Martha.
Martha, did you come home?
And are you re-shingling our roof?
There.
I still say we should have gone for a good old-fashioned moat.
Redecorating?
No, a dangerous jewel thief has escaped from the Other Realm.
Oh, a wanted poster.
Oh, I hate artist renderings.
They all look like Doodles Weaver in a stocking cap.
Hey, if you squint, this guy kind of looks like my pen pal.
- Really?
- Yeah, but it can't be Martha.
She's way too nice.
Jewels.
For an extremely dangerous criminal.
So then I sort of turned her into a cat and brought her home.
And having to smuggle her didn't strike you as odd?
When you say, "smuggle," it just sounds bad.
You signed up for a pen pal with a capital P. A pen pal with a capital P means a pal in the penitentiary.
Everyone knows that.
I bet I could round up a few people who don't.
She was working in the library.
The most dangerous criminals are always forced to shelve books.
Keeps bloodshed to a minimum.
She's got Salem.
Wah-jah!
- What are you doing?
- Expressing sheer delight.
I'm making a type of sushi known as fugu.
If it's not prepared exactly right, it can be lethal.
Hope, hope.
WOMAN : We interrupt Hey, Let's Wrap Things in Seaweed for a special bulletin.
Hot dog.
I'm gonna miss how to de-vein the poison sac.
There have been a rash of jewel robberies reported in the Westbridge area.
That's right.
It was an emerald tie clip.
And beware, the thief may be trying to pass himself off as a licensed private eye or a member of the Lions Club.
She's been seen talking to a blond accomplice.
A blond accomplice?
Oh, no.
Reporting live from Westbridge High School.
We now return-- Those three run way too much.
Oh.
Too late.
Your pen pal's gone with the goods.
Okay, I admit it.
I misjudged her.
More bad news.
I just checked.
All our jewels are missing from our safe.
Oh, no.
- We have jewels?
- Of course.
Oh.
We have a safe?
Let's think.
Since Martha has no magic of her own, she probably wanted the jewels so that she can buy potions on the magic black market.
So she can have her own magic back, continue her evil ways, and wreak havoc on an unsuspecting world.
Where is this safe?
- I'm in denial here.
- We've got to find her.
Let's see.
The book and the rope came from school.
You better go back there in case she thinks of anything else she needs.
And I'll call the Other Realm police.
Good.
I'll see if there's any information on Martha on the Witch Wide Web.
She had lovely penmanship.
Oh!
- What are you doing here?
Just getting out of wrestling practise.
What are you doing here?
I-- I forgot my chemistry book.
- Jewels?
- Oh.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's where I put the props from the school production of Rich People that hasn't been announced yet, that I'm starring in, that I haven't told anyone about yet.
Heh.
Is that by Thornton Wilder?
So Sabrina Spellman is a jewel thief and future prison laundry employee.
Aha.
They're in this together.
You know what?
You go ahead.
I-- I gotta find something else.
Martha was once in prison for trying to steal the Star of Orion.
- The rarest gem in the universe?
- Once owned by Elizabeth Taylor.
Whoever possesses it can use it to steal power from other witches.
Isn't it still on display at the Other Realm Museum of Cosmic Debris?
Yes.
Next to a chunk of Skylab.
My guess is, we go there, we find Martha.
And now for the toxic fugu inexpertly prepared.
Great.
No death.
Oh, it's gonna be really hard to find you in there, Spellman.
Spellman?
Is that a black hole?
Oh.
Oh, my eyes!
Okay, Martha, where are you?
You may be a dangerous criminal, but you're not very good as a hider.
Got you.
- What are you doing here?
- I just followed Martha here.
but I guess our screams have eliminated the element of surprise.
So we were right.
She is gonna steal the Star of Orion.
We've come up with a plan.
Well, actually, Zelda came up with the plan while I looked for gum.
Cinnamon?
We'll use a hand-in-the-cookie-jar spell.
See, once Martha grabs the Star of Orion, a cookie jar will appear around her hand.
The problem is, we have to be next to the stone in order to enact it.
Oh, what's stopping you?
I mean, besides the death rays.
We found the control box that turns the beams off, but we can't get into it because it's magic-proof.
Well, why don't you use your nuclear necklace to blow it open?
That's perfect.
Once again, Mother comes through.
Oh, yeah.
Don't we love her.
Nothing.
Okay.
I was just transported by a closet to another dimension.
I see the problem.
Mother didn't include a battery with it.
I know we're doomed, but I feel an incredible sense of justice.
Well, one of us is gonna have to crawl under those deadly beams, and these are new pants so you two can duke it out.
What we need is somebody who's not afraid to die.
I know.
Do you mind?
Salem, we need you to run through these security beams - to see how dangerous they are.
- It's your chance to cheat death.
Finally.
I won't be thwarted this time.
Stand back.
Whew.
Warm, warm.
Hot, hot, hot, hot.
Oh.
Salem, you big baby, the beams didn't even touch you.
You don't understand.
I blister easy.
I need aloe.
Zap me home, you mean, mean women.
Why don't we use your necklace, Zelda?
Oh, that's right, it doesn't work.
Heh.
Hello?
Okay.
Be cool, Kraft.
You are either lost in a parallel universe or you are being digested.
Hilda, I need the coupon for those ball bearings Mother gave you.
Because your present stinks doesn't mean you can have mine.
The coupon is shiny.
Perhaps we can use it to reflect one of the lasers onto the control box to open it.
Good thinking, MacGyver.
- Oops.
- Ha, ha.
Not only is my gift better than yours, but now you owe me a whole bunch of ball bearings.
Great.
Okay, here goes.
Whoever touches this stone from a star, encase their hand in a cookie jar.
The spell's activated.
That must be Martha.
Quick, hide.
I'll turn the beams back on.
Hmm.
This potion better be worth a bag of stolen jewels.
Why didn't we think of that?
There it is.
All the power in the universe.
It looked better in the catalogue, but  - Hey.
- We've got her.
Security's coming.
I'm holding the Star of Orion.
That might look suspicious.
Maybe I should have incanted the unbreakable-plastic-cookie-jar spell.
- Hello?
- As if it couldn't get any worse.
Ladies and gentlemen, my vice principal.
Oh, what a mess.
And me without my whisk broom.
- Freeze!
- Oh, finally.
I was-- - Hey.
Hey.
- Hey, don't hurt him.
- Don't hurt her.
- Hilda?
Oh!
Oh, I should have seen this coming.
Hey, take it easy.
I'm going, I'm going.
Don't hurt them.
Oh, shucks, they didn't hear me.
Martha.
So I guess when we agreed to be pen pals, I was the only one who took the pal part seriously.
You're right, Sabrina.
You've been so nice and I've taken advantage.
Here, take this stone.
Save me from myself.
See?
You aren't all bad.
I knew I was a good judge of people.
Hmm.
Now I have your magic.
See you.
Oh, I'm really glad no one else was here to see that.
You're in for a world of hurt, librarian.
Give me back my magic.
Well, at least give me back my necklace.
I need more unguent.
It hurts so very, very bad.
Oh, they're not here.
That's right.
Well, it was a good rehearsal, though.
I'm not asking you again.
Where's the stone?
It's in my kidney?
- He's innocent.
- Sit down.
We'll get to you later, Poindexter.
Mean.
- Is she your accomplice?
- We date a little.
Ow!
Bursitis.
When he said, "Get to you," he meant just you, right?
Boris.
That's to fix the wobble in the table, right?
Back off, witch girl.
What are you doing still chasing me?
You don't have any magic.
But I still have my wits and a penny.
- Yaah!
- Whoo-hoo!
Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Martha?
Okay, where is this Martha who you claim took the Star of Orion?
- I don't know.
- I'm thinking.
Hail Mary, full of grace--   No.
I gave you back your magic and your teensy little diamond.
What more do you want?
To turn you in and save my aunts.
And that diamond was one-twentieth of a quarter carat, lady.
Oh, no.
They're torturing them.
Or not.
Sabrina, thank goodness you're here.
They've been tickling us mercilessly.
Zelda and Willard did it.
Oh, we're saved.
Never mind.
- They're not communists.
- This is the woman you want.
That's Martha, the notorious jewel thief.
Grab her.
Wait a minute.
She's a jewel thief and that's the Star of Orion in her purse.
I'm gonna go with my gut and say these people are not guilty.
So who wants to start with the "Job well done, Sabrina"?
Yes, you did a nice job of smuggling in a dangerous criminal.
Who then got us arrested and tortured.
But look on the bright side.
I don't suppose you could loosen these, seeing as how I'm already a prisoner of your charms.
Martha's really come out of her shell.
He bumped his head and had some wild dream?
No.
We've used that one.
- Bad pork.
- Did it twice.
- Okay, what happened?
- Just go with me.
Don't you remember, Mr. Kraft?
The EPA found methane in your office, and it's known to cause hallucinations.
So all you need to do is burn your clothes and take some more sulphur.
Never leave the excuse to a teenager.
Methane?
Sulphur?
Oh, holy day, I'm not crazy.
So Martha convinced me that she was a dull, nice librarian, but I still think she was sincere when she laughed at my jokes.
Oh, honey, everybody misjudges people.
When Salem was busy trying to take over the world, your Aunt Hilda was convinced he was just a workaholic.
"Salem.
A clerical error has been made on the clerical correction of your original clerical error.
You don't have nine lives left, you've got one".
One?
Just one.
Okay, I want a helmet, some body armour, and a quiet corner where I can avoid all danger.
And would someone move that spoon?
Well, Mother just called.
Apparently, the gift certificate was for gold earrings, not ball bearings.
I misread her very bad handwriting.
See?
She wasn't being unfair.
- So is everything okay with you two?
- I guess.
Although, my bedroom is now filled with 4 tons of cracked corn, and I'm not allowed to watch television for a week.
Cracked corn?
Isn't that one of the signs of the apocalypse?
Run away.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
MAN : Stay tuned.
You're just eight hours away from an all-new episode of When Good Witches Go Bad.
I can write better stuff than this garbage.
What are you calling garbage?
You don't know the first thing about television.
So that would qualify me to be your boss.
Oh, yeah?
We interrupt this regularly-scheduled programme to beat you up.
Yikes, first Cokie Roberts and now him?
I thought the V-Chip was supposed to prevent this sort of thing.
I'm gonna milk this show for laughs.
What's all this?
"200 Mexican Dishes for Lovers"?
"Corn, the Sensuous Vegetable"?
"SoufflÃ©, Okay"?
I'm cooking dinner with Bryce, that guy I met at the bookstore.
What were you doing at a bookstore?
- Trying to meet guys.
- Okay.
I'm a little concerned.
Salem's in my bedroom with a guy who called him "babe".
That's the TV producer from the Witch Channel.
Salem's pitching him ideas for a new show.
Picture this: a crusty but loveable dictator who inherits an orphanage.
We'll call it Il Duce and the Kids.
Oh, come on.
People hate stuff about the mindless swaying of the masses.
Our focus groups prove this.
A workplace comedy set in a petting zoo?
Bible stories dramatised by a troupe of sock puppets.
Really nice meeting you, Saberhagen.
Excuse me, your office is on my jacket.
I know.
How about a cat who lives with a teenage witch?
The catch is, the witch is half mortal.
I like it.
Except for the cat part.
Same here.
I see this as a documentary type of show.
You know, hidden cameras where we can capture her every waking moment.
Are you a mind reader?
Saberhagen, if this show's a hit, you're gonna be a rich man.
Say that again.
Slower.
Oh, Libby?
Yes, Mr. Kraft?
Libby.
It seems that no one has volunteered to be school safety monitor.
You don't expect me to do that dorky job.
The biggest loser in school wouldn't do it.
Well, as secretary of the student council, you get to appoint anyone you'd like.
Anyone?
Please proceed with caution.
This is a hallway, not the autobahn.
She's a safety monitor.
Why don't we just put a black dot on her forehead and call her an untouchable?
Maybe we can save it in editing.
You know, Sabrina, regarding that gum on the floor, I still feel that you should put a few pylons around it.
You know, I ran a much tighter ship when I was safety monitor, despite the savage beatings.
Zellie, you have gotta help me decide which one of these belts to wear at my dinner with Bryce tomorrow.
I've narrowed it down to these 15.
Oh, good Lord, look at this one.
Say, that's my favourite too.
I got it at the Other Realm Outlet Mall.
It really brings out my eyes, huh?
If your eyes were a frightening shade of purple.
You should see my mother-in-law.
They said she's as ugly as sin.
Sin sued.
Hilda, you don't have a mother-in-law.
She's not so much a mother-in-law as a big tub of goo.
A tub who says I don't make enough money.
Aha.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe it has something to do with this belt.
- I can't get it off!
- Oh.
Oh, no, Hilda, it's a borscht belt.
It won't come off until you've told a million jokes.
A million jokes.
Oh, well, then I should tell you about my ex-wife.
I took her everywhere.
It was easier than having to kiss her goodbye.
Ha!
- Help me.
- I could try to get you a job opening for Marilyn McCoo.
Oh, not now.
Oh, Hilda, I'm sorry, but I've been summoned to the Other Realm.
I'll be back to help you as soon as I can.
Meanwhile, don't quit your day job.
No, no, don't cancel it.
I promise, Sabrina's not always dull.
Hey, you're home from lunch.
Wanna go skydiving?
I just wanna put my feet up, eat cereal and summon the strength to get through the rest of the day.
I know what would be relaxing, juggling steak knives.
Or we could just talk.
Teen pregnancy, what are your thoughts?
Well, I'm against teen pregnancy, but I'm for you juggling steak knives.
Well, at least she exited with a joke.
Aah!
The Grim Reaper!
No, Sabrina!
It's me, Aunt Zelda.
The grim part is this material doesn't breathe.
I'm so sorry I scared you, dear.
Every witch has to do this at some point.
It's like jury duty without the free doughnuts.
I find it unsettling that my aunt goes around telling people it's time to die.
Wait, that's not why you're talking to me, is it?
No, no, no.
You've got it all wrong.
This is merely a service for witches who don't take bad news well.
Like an IRS audit or a particularly nasty boil.
We break it to them gently.
But why the outfit?
Tradition.
And the traditional clipboard?
Well, we give them a receipt for tax purposes.
Oh, well, duty calls.
Someone's about to bounce a cheque.
Mrs. Quick, I can't see because of the glare from Sabrina's sash.
Class, please, I don't want to hear anyone making fun of how stupid Sabrina looks.
Look, I swear on my mother's grave-- Okay, my mother's condo.
--Sabrina's World is gonna get much more exciting.
I can't tell you how, exactly, but let's just say it involves a whole lot of blood.
Salem, can you pick this clasp with your claws?
That was Sabrina.
She forgot something really important for chemistry class.
- What is it?
- A barrel of nuclear waste.
Is that nuclear waste?
According to the label.
But the label's burning because it's leaking.
- Oh, my.
- You're the safety monitor.
What do we do?
Okay, everybody stay calm, get in single file and run for your lives!
It's okay, everyone, just a little minor radiation.
None of us wanted to have kids anyway, right?
Oh, very disappointing, Miss Spellman.
In my day, safety monitors cleaned up toxic spills themselves.
And I've got the lesions to prove it.
- Yello?
- Salem, it's Sabrina.
Something strange is going on.
Good.
I mean, Sabrina's not here.
Well, I'm out of here.
I've gotta drop off some dry cleaning and tell a guy about his prostate.
Oh, that reminds me.
Sabrina called.
She needs to get her grey dress cleaned.
Oh.
Next year, uniforms.
Anyone home?
Anyone who happened to see my clothes?
Hey, I'm on TV.
I'm on TV?
People are probably watching this right now, and I'm wearing a shrubbery.
Salem!
First things first, no mortals around.
And now to eliminate the cat.
What's all this?
Your fan mail.
"I love your show.
Is it hard to drool that much while you're sleeping"?
- Gross.
- Is it?
I have an overbite.
All right, all right.
Hey, Mom.
No nukes.
Heh.
Salem?
Someone better be harming you.
Oh, yes.
Oh-ho, very good.
Oh, right there.
Sven, of all the perks I've gotten from this television show, you're my favourite.
In fact, you're officially in my entourage.
Oh, yeah.
Here we go.
Oh, yeah.
A little rough, Sven.
Hey, Sabrina?
Oh, well, then you obviously haven't been watching TV.
Oh, you found out, huh?
Yeah.
Salem, how many people watched me hawk up a phlegm ball this morning?
Morning is a low-viewing time, so I'd say not more than millions?
- Millions?
- You're a huge star.
Especially in prisons.
This stops now.
I don't know where you've hidden your cameras, but I want them gone, understand?
Sorry, sweetie.
I own the rights to your life.
I've got a contract and it's ironclad.
I didn't sign anything.
No, but the cat did.
Oh, go ahead and try to fight it.
By the time it reach the courts, we'll be watching your dotage.
Would you like an herbal wrap?
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
If the contract is ironclad, there's no way out.
A marriage contract?
My husband says marriage isn't a word, it's a sentence.
Ha!
Her husband?
It's a long story.
You know, I've heard of television shows getting cancelled when their ratings are lousy, but short of that happening, you're sunk.
Hey, great idea.
I'll just make my show unbearably dull.
That way, no one'll watch it.
It'll get yanked.
Watch out, young lady.
With that approach, someday you'll run your own network.
Ha-ha.
Harvey, what happened?
I'm sure it was very dull.
You remember when I went to the mall to buy socks?
Yes.
Great topic.
So did you go with the all-cotton or the wool-poly blend?
Believe it or not, that wasn't the exciting part.
On the way to the mall, I rescued this family from a burning building.
I see.
Well, so, back to the socks.
And there I was, eating a Mr. Slushy, when suddenly, I heard someone cry for help.
Ow!
Ow!
Does that welding torch have to be so hot?
Ow!
Ow!
What size was your slushy?
Shouldn't we go see if whoever was screaming can be helped?
No, she's just memorising her lines.
Community theatre.
Heh.
This dullness thing won't last.
- Sabrina will break.
- She better.
Okay, kids, I'm off.
Somebody's got asbestos in his crawl space.
Was that your aunt dressed like the Grim Reaper?
Yeah, she's in the same play.
There she is, there she is.
It's TV's Sabrina.
Smile.
Oh, why, these are the other members of the theatre company.
They must be having a dress rehearsal.
What play are they doing?
Two Gentlemen of Verona?
Mrs. Quick, what happened to your face?
Oh, Sabrina, remember when I told you that peas were the one vegetable I wasn't allergic to?
I was horribly wrong.
Would you like to hear about my near-death experience?
No.
Actually, I'd rather talk to you about Jell-O.
But I saw God.
Guess what?
After school, the mayor's gonna give me a medal.
Wanna ride in the limo with me?
Harvey, do you mind?
We were having a conversation about Jell-O.
I'm a lime girl myself.
Saberhagen, our ratings are plummeting.
We've gotta do something.
Add a laugh track?
That thing won't budge.
Like my husband's hand on his wallet.
Zellie, what am I gonna do?
Bryce will be here any minute.
Maybe he won't have a sense of humour and he'll find you funny.
Zelda, there's something that I haven't told you about Bryce.
He's short, really short.
Why, he's so short, he has to reach up to tie his shoes.
Oh, my, he's gonna be a joke magnet.
- Help.
- Okay.
Well, how about if I stay for dinner and do all the talking for you?
Oh, that would be great, except you look like death.
Oh, right.
Well, I'll just tell him it's religious garb.
Zellie, what would I do without you?
Besides throw one heck of a party.
Ha!
Two hundred seventy-seven, Sabrina, will you please stop counting the ceiling tiles?
Now you made me mess up.
SABRINA : One, two, three, - Ceiling tiles, huh?
Heh-heh.
- four, five There is no way I'm letting this show get cancelled.
I haven't had a hit since Make Room for Nostradamus.
I found that show very predictable.
Predict this.
There's a twister in the hallway!
Head for the root cellar!
Huh?
- Sorry, I'm from the Midwest.
- I just know Salem's behind this.
Come on.
- Aren't you gonna help?
- Oh, a tornado's just like a cold.
You just have to let it run its course.
She's just sitting there.
Yet I'm riveted.
Hilda, Bryce is here.
He wanted me to warn you.
He's misplaced his toupee.
- Hi, Hilda.
- Hi, Bryce.
A pool hall called-- Ooh!
That's quite a cough you got there, Hilda.
I'm afraid Hilda's picked up a nasty virus that prevents her from talking.
- Laryngitis?
- Much worse.
Because my family has a home remedy.
We're Polish, you know.
- Mm.
- Easy, girl.
I'm afraid I have to run a small errand.
Another symptom.
I'll be right back.
Whatever he says, don't talk.
Okay, be brutal.
How do I look without the hairpiece?
Mr. Kraft, what are we going to do?
Well, why don't we ask our safety monitor?
Oh, well, we could talk about Jell-O?
It's rule number one of television: when things get slow, add conflict.
But not the kind of conflict that requires reconstructive surgery.
I will not let this be exciting.
Was that an earthquake?
Or a big truck.
It is trash day.
Just thinking out loud here, but is this such a good idea?
If something should happen to our star, I could have a few really uncomfortable weeks at home.
Not that I don't like good TV.
I haven't had this much trouble with a star since Gentle Ben.
MAN : Oh, my God!
In a way, this is like a ride.
This is Massachusetts, why are we having earthquakes?
Democrats!
Do something!
My life is at stake here.
Maybe if I brace you, you could just flip through the safety monitor's manual.
Listen up!
If we all stay calm, and more importantly, uninteresting, I might be able to lead us all to a fire exit.
That's better.
Have my eyes swollen shut or did the lights go out?
Is there anyone here who is qualified to take confession?
Oh, I've heard about this guy.
He won't accept bad news.
- Hello.
- I'm afraid I have bad news.
- Your shoes-- - Sorry.
Nobody home.
Come here, you little asparagus spears.
Zelda, hurry.
Hello?
Anyone there?
My greatest wish is that they find my body at least a few feet away from you people.
Come on, guys.
We're almost out of here.
We're all gonna die.
We're just all gonna die!
Mr. Kraft, would you please stop clutching my hand?
And mine!
I'm sorry.
I think that's me.
Hmm.
There's a sauce that'll put some hair on your chest.
- Yes?
- Your shoes will give you athlete's foot.
Sorry, didn't hear you.
See?
Except for a few cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, we're all gonna be okay.
Aftershock!
Oh, will it never end?
I give up.
It's never gonna stop!
Never!
Never!
Never!
I'm sorry, Sabrina.
You're on my last nerve.
If I don't make it out of here, give this to my lawyer.
It's a declaration of love.
Oh, that's for Sandra Bullock.
I know you saw me and I know you heard me.
Now, sign the freaking receipt so I can be on my way.
- Can't write.
- Aah!
Yes.
We made it.
We didn't have to resort to cannibalism.
Hold it.
Who's gonna represent us in our lawsuit against the school?
Please let that be the sophomore with the glandular condition.
Is it the fat sophomore?
What do you think?
Nope.
Walter's legs are not that green.
Dinosaur!
Mrs. Quick, you may have to slap me.
Now, let's be calm.
What's happened is the Earth's tectonic plates have shifted, certain gaseous solutions have imploded, and we're all going to die.
- Go, safety monitor!
- What?
Wait, you expect me to face that creature alone?
Of course not.
Here.
- Uhn!
- Aim high.
I have to admit, this is pretty exciting.
More corn?
Okay, I'll just engage it in friendly conversation, then maybe it'll go away.
What language do giant lizards speak?
Of course, Japanese.
I didn't know Sabrina could speak Japanese.
Oh, yes.
It's part of every safety monitor's training.
DINOSAUR : A French dinosaur.
I only wish this was the strangest thing I've ever encountered.
Hilda, I know something's wrong.
I don't think you even have laryngitis.
I think it was all a bald-faced lie.
Sorry.
I don't mean to be short.
Short?
You're so short, when it rains, you're the last to know.
You could milk a cow standing up.
And bald?
You're so bald, an eagle tried to hatch your head.
You know what?
There's a cure for baldness.
It's called hair.
Boy, Sabrina, you really saved the day.
You know, all this drama has helped me put my life in perspective.
For example, I no longer obsess over the fact that a single pea could kill me.
Ha.
Thanks for being so brave, Sabrina.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was brave.
It was exciting.
This whole day stinks.
Let's not forget who appointed her safety monitor.
You know what I'm gonna do for you?
I'm gonna make you a bowl of Jell-O.
I never knew you liked it so much.
Hilda, I've got bad news.
Bryce is going to break up with you.
You're too late.
He just left.
Oh, Hildie, I'm so sorry.
Sign the receipt.
Hey, Sabrina.
Everything okay?
No.
My life has become such an adventure that Sabrina's World will never be cancelled.
My hometown was so small, you couldn't buy a house without exact change.
Our family doctor worked at Joe's Hospital and Grill.
What's Aunt Hilda doing in my slot?
Well, I paid a little visit to your TV producer.
My outfit made him kind of nervous, so he made me a deal.
If I didn't kill him, he'd cancel Sabrina's World.
I thought you didn't actually kill people.
Well, I don't.
But I sort of mumbled his bad news and he thought I said he was going to die.
- What was the news?
- He was gonna get a bad piece of pie.
Seriously, a man walks into a bar, says to a horse, - "Why the long face"?
- Oh, dear.
You know, I'm gonna start reading more.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hilda, this kitten could use some mittens.
I made you a turtleneck, and you haven't worn it once.
I loved that sweater.
I shredded it in less than an hour.
I can't get through Wuthering Heights.
Someone please tell me what happens, so I can write my report?
Oh, honey, don't take a shortcut.
You need to discover the love between Catherine and Heathcliff on your own.
- You're right.
Aunt Hilda?
- Sorry.
Never read it.
Emily BrontÃ« bugged me.
She was in my English class and she always thought she was so brilliant.
I know a way I can find out on my own.
Take me into the book Knowing what happens would be heaven Flip ahead to page 21 1 Heathcliff!
Heathcliff!
Dang, these moors are cold.
All right.
You're right.
I'll read the book.
I tried to warn you: no shortcuts.
Did Heathcliff ask about me?
Remember, only you can prevent laughter.
Oh, stupid crossword puzzle.
This is not gonna turn out ugly like that tic-tac-toe incident, is it?
You know, despite my dating history, I can't think of a word for a male turkey.
- Coffee!
- No, something with three letters.
I stayed up all night finishing my book report.
- Without any shortcuts.
- Good girl.
I know I'm sleep-deprived, but is Aunt Hilda cleaning her ears with rope?
It's mental floss.
It clears your mind.
Plus, gives you a quick burst of temporary knowledge.
- I wish you'd do that in private.
- Of course.
A male turkey is a tom.
Thank you, mental floss.
I believe that is a shortcut.
Technically, yes, but it gives your mind a minty-fresh feeling.
- Did Salem join a marching band?
- Anything's possible.
Yesterday, he wanted to be a June Taylor dancer.
It's election time in the Other Realm!
I want you to vote.
And I want you to stop calling me.
Was that Uncle Sam?
Uh, in the Other Realm, he's known as Uncle Roy.
We're not sure why.
Hey.
There's a proposition that would make it legal to tell your mortal boyfriend about your magic.
It's too bad I'm not old enough to vote.
Oh, honey, you are.
In the Other Realm, the voting age is 17.
Really?
I feel so grown-up.
I get to vote I get to vote - And I don't.
- Salem, you're a convicted felon.
Not to mention a cat.
But I wanted to vote to change the pronunciation of Friday to "Fridyah".
Hey, if this boyfriend proposition passes, I could tell Harvey everything.
Well, except for the fact that I don't really care that Michael Jordan retired.
And I can tell my honey, Hank, that I'm a witch.
Your first date's not until tonight.
He's already your honey?
It's called optimism.
There's an orientation this afternoon for first-time voters.
I get to choose a political party.
Oh, well, I hope you'll join mine: the Social Democratic Do-Gooder Party.
No, join my party.
It's called the Party Party.
Our slogan is: Party!
Will you help me?
I'm not a very good seamstress.
Then it was kind of an odd choice to volunteer for the costume committee.
It's for the church play.
It's the Lord's work.
Okay, well, I'm busy after school today, but I can help you and the Lord tomorrow.
Your girlfriend is a saint.
Are you tired from working on your book report too?
No.
For once I finished early.
I'm tired because My mom's in her third trimester, the baby's pushing against her bladder, and the toilet-flushing is keeping me up all night.
I thought you made a bed out of fertiliser bags in the garage.
I did.
My dad's using it.
You know, I can tell you anything.
I hope you feel the same way.
I will.
Very soon.
All right, everybody, take a seat, so we can talk about the issues.
I assume that everyone here - has figured out your family secret.
- What?
Because, as absolutely everyone knows, if you haven't solved your family secret, - you can't vote.
- What?
So just as a formality, let's have a show of hands.
Those who have.
And those who haven't.
Oh, come on, I can't be the only one.
I've just about got it.
I've started taking Ginkoba.
Want some?
No.
Are they chewable?
Will you do my hair?
When we were girls in our early hundreds, I liked the way you fixed it.
Oh, all right.
Oh.
I haven't worn this since I was almost beheaded.
Why didn't you tell me you have to solve your secret before you vote?
Well, that's new.
You used to only have to know how to work a toaster.
What a surprise.
A witch rule that works to my disadvantage.
Sabrina, don't worry.
You'll figure out the family secret in time to vote.
How many clues have you solved?
Wait a minute while I add them up.
One.
Sabrina, I had no idea you were so slow.
I mean, um, behind.
I think you could use a tutor.
Well, that's not a bad idea.
I'm really ready to buckle down.
Bring on a professional.
Hello, I'm Mr. Saberhagen, and you may refer to me as "Mr. Saberhagen".
How did I end up with you as my tutor?
Hey, I solved my family secret with only two clues.
Now, let's turn to the puzzle board.
Let's remove the dirty clothes from the puzzle board.
That's not a StairMaster, young lady.
Okay, well, I know this clue: Spellman.
So the family secret must be about us.
Look out, Harvard.
Let's begin at the beginning.
First clue.
What is it?
- Chickens?
- Chickens?
Do they look like chickens?
Next clue.
Okay.
M plus a picture of fire.
M plus fire.
I've got it.
M'fire.
Right.
M'fire.
That makes so much sense.
Let's use it in a sentence: "Run, run, the house is on m'fire".
I've got a better one: "You're m'fired".
You can't m'fire me.
I m'quit.
Oh, more campaign flyers.
Yes, I'm definitely voting to save the magical ping.
Who'd want to change it to a ding?
Me.
I'm sick of the ping.
I'd love to hear a ding.
- But the ping has such a ring.
- But the ding has zing.
I can't discuss politics with you.
So, Hank, tell me about you.
Well, let's see.
I collect jaguars.
Jaguars?
Be right back.
Sure, foxy lady.
All right.
Okay, what were we talking about?
Oh, yes.
Jaguars.
Do you know that my favourite is the Vicarage with the 3.4-litre XK engine with 4-speed transmission and electric overdrive-- Hilda, I collect jaguars, as in cats.
Oh.
Be right back.
I guess I have to go back to Salem and grovel.
Ooh, a brain teaser.
Heart minus L?
Heart means love, and love minus the L would be "of".
I guess my grovelling days are over.
Mrs. Quick, I was just wondering how you solved that clue so fast.
Well, actually I'm addicted to game shows.
Well, at least it's legal.
I went to a 12-step meeting for help.
It was fun.
They give you clues, and you had to solve when and where the meetings were held.
It wasn't the best way to kick the habit.
Well, I've got this new game at home.
It's called Guess the Family Secret.
- You wanna come over and try it?
- Well, I really shouldn't.
It's been a long, hard road staying clean.
Oh, well, come on.
You can always be a social game player.
Well, I usually watch Little House reruns after school, but What the heck.
I have them all on DVD.
Hey, Sabrina, you ready to help me with my costumes?
Oh, no, I totally forgot.
I made other plans.
Oh, okay, Sabrina.
I'll meet you at your house.
I can't wait to see your new game.
You're having Mrs. Quick over to play?
Harvey.
You'd do anything for me, right?
I'm not feathering my hair again.
No, I want you to help Valerie out with her costumes.
What can I do?
I am not going to twirl.
MAN : Vote yes on Prop.
2,000,002.
It's time to stop the growing abuse of mental floss.
Paid for by witches who want to stop the growing abuse of mental floss.
That's ridiculous.
That'll never pass.
It will if I have something to say about it.
Mental floss encourages lazy habits, and even your mind is a terrible thing to waste.
I'm going right now to campaign for the cause.
It is every witch's right to floss, and I will fight for that right with every fibre of my being.
But first, another date with Hank.
Mmm.
Salem, are my aunts home?
Hilda and Zelda have left the building.
Excellent.
Keep watch and warn me if they come home.
Ooh, throwing a crazy party?
Complete with trash-can punch and spit swapping?
No, I'm having my algebra teacher over.
Yeah, right.
How pathetic would that be--?
Oh, you're serious.
Oh, come on in.
A cat.
Eating a banana.
How strange.
He's part chimp on his mother's side.
Wait here.
I'll go set up the game.
ANNOUNCER : Mrs. Quick, come on down.
This is the best at-home version I've ever seen.
Okay, well, let's take our places and get started.
Is this a genuine Goodson-Todman buzzer?
Let's start.
We don't know how much time we got.
Look at the microphone.
Ah!
Look at my name.
Look at the clues.
- There's even a glass of water.
Neat.
- I've got to move things along.
And here's our host, Monty Hall.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Monty Hall?
- You pay a little extra.
- Oh!
It's time to guess the family secret.
Let's solve the puzzle.
But before we do, a word with our contestants.
Mrs. Quick, tell us something about yourself.
Well, I was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, and a lot of people don't know this, Monty, but it's the stewed-fruit capital of the United States.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
First clue.
I didn't take that from little old ladies in chicken suits, so I'm not gonna take it from you.
All right?
First clue.
Sabrina?
Pass.
Birds in a house.
Birdhouse would be too obvious.
So, what else do you call that?
- Oh, an aviary.
- Aviary?
Yeah, but aviary doesn't make any sense, so it must be a word that sounds like aviary.
Oh!
"Every".
Next clue now.
Sabrina?
Pass.
Let me see.
"M plus fire" eq-- - Sabrina.
- Aunt Zelda.
You're just in time for the bonus round.
Well, can't we finish the game?
I've got the fever.
I'm hot.
Okay, well, I'll just get started on that novel.
Sabrina, what were you thinking?
That I could avoid this ugly scene that's about to happen.
Sabrina, using a shortcut to solve your family secret can have serious consequences.
I just wanna be able to vote.
And Mrs. Quick is really lonely.
You leave me no choice but to punish you.
To learn the error of her ways No shortcuts for one days And might I say, nice rhyme.
That means no modern conveniences for 24 hours.
If you try something like this again the Witches' Council will intervene, and they're a lot more strict than I am.
Now clean up this mess.
And I was hoping Family Secret would go into syndication.
Sabrina.
Wake up.
Come on, shake a leg.
If I continue with this shiatsu, you'll have to pay me.
It's so late.
How come my alarm didn't go off?
I believe an alarm clock would go under the umbrella of modern conveniences.
So apparently our forefathers were late for everything?
They've had hairdryers since the '70s.
They're not modern.
I'm late, I'm late.
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.
Sorry.
Why weren't you on the bus this morning?
It's a modern convenience.
And I'm against them and for solar energy.
Everybody with me?
Sabrina, this is a very complicated equation, so I'm allowing the use of calculators.
Oh, great.
It's a good thing I don't have a pacemaker.
I'm still not happy with the dress.
The bodice isn't right.
You're telling me.
I look like a house in it.
I need you for one more fitting.
Please?
I can't.
I have plans.
And they all involve me wearing pants.
Hey, Sabrina, after school, are we still on for the Slicery and pinball?
I can't.
Too modern.
How about a rousing game of mahjong?
What's this new anti-modern kick you're on?
Oh, if you call being concerned about this planet we call home a "kick".
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to find a buggy heading uptown.
You know, sometimes I get the feeling Sabrina doesn't tell me everything.
Well, since you don't have anything to do after school I need to learn how to say no.
Sabrina, I need to speak with you.
I'm still working on that algebra equation.
Who cares about that?
I was up half the night working on the second clue to the family secret game.
Really?
I don't wanna talk about it.
A real stumper, but I think I've got it.
M-- No.
I need to solve it myself.
I don't wanna hear it.
But-- But-- - But it's all right here.
- I can't see!
Then I guess you don't want to know.
Right.
I don't wanna know.
MAN'S  No shortcuts.
Oh, this can't be good.
Apparently, I'm on the lone prairie.
Maybe it's not so lone.
Mrs. Quick?
Oh, no, I guess she was an accomplice.
Sabrina, what are you doing here?
Aren't you wondering what you're doing here?
I'm dreaming.
This is one of my favourites.
Michael Landon should be along any minute.
I'm here at election headquarters where a very heated debate has erupted over mental floss.
Now, arguing in favour of flossing is Hilda Spellman.
Hilda Spellman has gone on record as saying, "A vote against mental floss would be a vote against family values".
Interestingly enough, arguing for the opposition is her sister, Zelda Spellman.
Now, Zelda-- Uncle Roy!
Uncle Roy, please, could we have a word?
What is your take on all of this?
This mental floss debate has turned into a smear campaign.
I've never seen so much mudslinging in my life.
Hilda, using mental floss is a crime against nature.
Get your knee out of my spine.
Ow!
- Ahh!
- Oh, good.
You're up.
What's the quickest way out of here?
If you're looking for a shortcut, I don't know any.
Oh, no shortcuts.
So I've been sent to the prairie because back then shortcuts didn't exist.
Are you here to explain things?
Well, I am a guide.
Have you got anything to eat?
Oh, you want something to eat.
I get it.
So I'm supposed to make something from scratch without using shortcuts and then my punishment will be over, I'll be zapped back, right?
I'm a little deaf, so let's go with yes.
You know, these dirt floors are really hard to get clean.
Mrs. Quick?
I am gonna make bread and butter from scratch.
That's not how my dream usually goes, but okay.
Okay, I made homemade bread and butter with no shortcuts.
We're about to be sent back home.
This is my dream and I'm not ready to go home.
You know, Sabrina, you're kind of bossy.
- This bread's got dirt on it.
- Just eat it.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
- Well?
- Thank you.
That should have worked.
Stupid embers.
Hey, that clue wasn't fire.
It was ember.
M plus ember equals "member".
That's really good, Sabrina.
That makes much more sense than what I had.
M'fire.
Okay, I figured it out by myself.
We're ready to go.
Big nothing.
Valerie?
I've never dreamed about two students before.
Sabrina, you decided to help out after all.
Isn't this a cool place for our church play?
Is Michael Landon with you?
This authentic log cabin is Westbridge's only historical monument.
Unless you count me.
He's a tour guide?
I've been in Westbridge this whole time?
I could've just walked home.
What do you and Mrs. Quick talk about?
Okay, why is my boyfriend wearing a bonnet?
He's filling in for Mrs. Bogle, the pastor's wife.
Of all days for her to have an allergic reaction to corn.
I've never dreamed about three students before.
I'm beginning to feel my life is empty.
Uh, Mrs. Quick, come with me.
This teacher's blue and needs a lift For all her trouble here's a gift Mmm.
What a wonderful dream.
Alone with Harrison Ford, dancing in the gardens of Versailles.
Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
I'm tired and I'm filthy.
We know the feeling.
- Where have you guys been?
- The campaign trail.
Oh, sure, we indulged in a little mudslinging, but the tips were great.
So how was life on the prairie?
- You knew about that?
- We had to sign the release form.
Lucky for you, the Witches' Council was so busy with the election, they didn't have time to send you back to the real prairie.
Oh, so you're trying to sugarcoat the fact that they took a shortcut?
Oh.
That reminds me.
I need to floss before I go vote.
- Not to mention, shower.
- Me first.
I've touched parts of animals you wouldn't put in sausage.
I can't remember anything about the issues.
We've been standing in line so long, your mental floss has probably worn off.
I, on the other hand, couldn't be more ready to vote.
Well, then I'll just re-floss.
It's still legal, you know.
Now, I'm an informed voter once again.
Oh, democracy blows.
So far I've got: "Every member of the Spellman" I'm getting there.
What's the rush?
I didn't get to vote, anyway.
Hey, the election results are on.
I wonder if mental floss got voted out?
MAN : 244.
Oh, that stinks.
And this just in: the "tell a mortal boyfriend" proposition has failed.
Thank you very much.
Now Harvey's gonna continue thinking he's losing his mind forever.
Let's not beat ourselves up.
Our votes wouldn't have mattered.
What a close race.
One vote in favour would have called for a runoff.
- Two votes would've won it.
I don't know what's worse: that we lost, or that Zelda gets to gloat.
That Aunt Zelda gets to gloat.
Oh, I'm not gloating.
There are some propositions that passed that I'm very unhappy about.
Did you hear the good news?
- What?
Thank God it's Fridyah.
I've forgotten how much I love this book.
Oh, no.
This chapter's missing.
I'm going to the library.
Oh, what the heck.
Heathcliff!
Heathcliff!
Looking for a chapter?
Taking a shortcut?
It was a mistake.
I'm on the moors because I was looking for Roger Moore.
Dudley Moore?
All right, I took a shortcut.
You told me we were going for ice cream.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Sabrina, what are you doing home?
I thought your job at Pork on a Pole - started this afternoon.
- It did.
I quit.
Why?
Were the working conditions unsafe?
- No.
- Was your boss a total monster?
- No.
- You got caught with you hand - in the till, didn't you?
- No.
Sabrina, no matter what happened, no matter how horrible, we'll understand.
Within reason.
Where's your dignity?
The worst part is, I had to buy it.
Tonight, the curious case of the teenage witch.
Yes, I am the first junior to get our class ring.
Daddy bought it for me after I gave him the silent treatment for a week.
Don't touch.
I think class rings are so ugly.
I've gotta have one.
Any luck on the job front?
Nothing that doesn't involve polyester - and public humiliation.
- Same here.
And let me be the first to tell you, chicken suits don't breathe.
Oh, if you ladies are strapped for cash, I know a place where you can make top dollar.
- Really?
Where?
- My house.
I'm looking for some enterprising person to scrape the guano off my bat house and the entire 75 cents an hour is, under the table.
Know the scariest thing about his offer?
- What?
- I'm thinking about taking it.
I don't know what I'll do if Sabrina ever finds out.
Man, you're in a tough spot.
Sabrina, a girlfriend shouldn't eavesdrop on her boyfriend.
- Let me do it.
- No, wait.
It's not eavesdropping.
They're talking so loudly it's impossible not to overhear.
Now, pipe down.
- Harvey.
- Sabrina.
We were just listening-- Looking for you.
So do you wanna go job-hunting after school today?
No.
I mean, I can't.
I already have plans.
I have to take care of my plans.
Are we done with the third degree here?
Don't worry.
I'm sure he's not seeing someone else.
I wasn't even thinking that until now.
I'm starting to get a little worried that Sabrina hasn't solved the family secret yet.
I can't wait to see the look on her face when she gets it.
- I wish we could just tell her.
- And ruin the surprise?
Sabrina, you're eavesdropping.
It's not eavesdropping.
It's controlled overhearing.
I was gonna say, you can hear better through the air vent in the laundry room.
Do you think my aunts are gonna get me my class ring as a surprise?
- No.
- No.
You know, it's very rude to eavesdrop on people.
I know.
I overheard someone say that.
When you eavesdrop, you never get the entire story.
Five hundred redcoats will be landing tomorrow at Boston Harbor.
Give the signal.
The British attack at dawn.
And at 12 shillings apiece, these babies should fly off the shelves.
The British are coming.
- No, they're not.
The British are coming.
No, they're not.
And that's how Hilda came to start a little thing we like to call the American Revolution.
Yeah, well, it's not like things have gone bad for Britain since then.
Hey, things turned out okay, for the people who lived.
Look, if you really want enough money to buy that class ring, you should call the Other Realm Employment Agency.
I remember this one job they got me once.
Can't you guys ever tell a story without the whole room going fuzzy?
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go call and make an appointment.
Warning, warning.
Danger, danger.
Don't tell me.
Will Robinson's in trouble?
I've been sent by the Witches' Council to give you a warning.
If Sabrina doesn't solve the family secret soon, the consequences will be dire.
And, baby, I mean dire.
- For Sabrina?
- No, for you.
I love that mislead, heh-heh.
I called and made an appointment at the Other Realm Employment Agency.
No.
You are not leaving this house until you solve the family secret.
- But-- - That's final, young lady.
And you know when I call you young lady, I mean business.
Okay, from now on, I'm gonna have to videotape all my transactions with them.
Warning, warning.
Danger, Danger.
If you'd asked, we would've told you - that those nuts were stale.
- Why are you here?
Sabrina's hard at work on the family secret.
But only because you're forcing her to, not because she wants to.
How do you know so much about us?
It's creepy.
Be that as it may, you have to motivate her without preventing her from leading a normal life.
- You're breaking the rules.
- I never break rules.
I'm not even comfortable making a right turn on red.
You're breaking rules for helping your teen solve the family secret.
- They're all right there.
- Filmstrips?
We're hoping to get it on microfiche by the end of the year.
And don't forget, the consequences will be-- - Dire.
- But nothing compared to the consequences if you don't return these rewound.
Okay, first you tell me to get a job to pay for the class ring.
Second, I've tried to solve that family secret for months.
We think it's wonderful that you're getting a job.
Aren't you late for an interview?
Sometimes the first impression is the only impression.
Okay, now I've got to get a job, solve the family secret and find out if senility is hereditary.
Okay, honey, let's take a look at your rÃ©sumÃ©.
I really hope you can help me.
Doll, I once got Pauly Shore his own series.
I can help you.
I can't help you.
Please?
I'm desperate.
Don't you have anything?
But you have no experience, no skills and Congress isn't in session right now, so Oh, wait, I know, you could be a sandman.
- I could be the sandman?
- No, a sandman.
Am I talking too fast for you, dear?
It's like a paper route.
You put the people in your neighbourhood to sleep at night.
Any idiot can do it, so you're qualified.
I'll take it.
Wait.
Is there a uniform involved?
Let me guess: I have to buy it?
MAN : Nor is it permissible to strike your teen with lightning to motivate them.
Oh, finally.
That's the last one.
So I was right.
Yes, you were right.
I knew there wasn't a rule against using rabid Packer fans to motivate your teen.
But I want a glass of water.
You've already had Go to sleep.
But I have to go to the  Aw, when you're not whining you're actually kind of cute.
Okay, I've lost my mind.
Well, this kind of breaks up the day.
Hey, when I touch him, I go into his dream.
Cool.
- Ew, don't put that in your mouth.
- But it's candy.
Hey, you're right.
It is candy.
It's not very good candy, but it's your dream.
There.
Give it a try.
DOOR : Solve the family secret.
Solve the family secret.
Perfect.
Now let's work on that fresco over her bed.
She was hard to get to sleep.
I had to use so much sand on her, she could be used as a bank ashtray.
Wonder what she's dreaming.
What was that?
"Come into my dream, Sabrina".
If you insist.
A test?
I-- I haven't studied.
I haven't even opened the book.
My whole grade depends on this.
The rest of my life depends on passing this class.
Where are my clothes?
Twenty-three thousand four hundred and fifty-one, The Jolly Green Giant is a cruel taskmaster.
Mr. Kraft is a deeply tormented man.
Cool.
It's such a gasser to be named a member of the Rat Pack, baby.
Now that it's official, how do we ditch Lawford?
Freak.
Loser.
Loser-freak.
Geek cluster.
I told you to stay home today.
This is just a normal day at school.
Oh, I get it.
Every day in high school is a dream come true for Libby.
There's a spill.
Yep, that happened today.
Oh, ow.
George, watch the splinters.
Hey.
Get out of my dream.
Sabrina, I can't believe you dream-dropped.
Can't believe there's a word for it.
Dreams reveal a person's innermost thoughts, feelings and desires.
George Washington?
And your presence in them could influence the course of events in that person's life.
I'm sorry.
I'll never drop into one of your dreams again.
But I think I'm the one who suffered the most.
Even though you're in big, big trouble, young lady, there's no reason you can't have some hot cocoa.
This have anything to do with the cheeseheads passed out in the living room?
Valerie, listen.
I know you tend to worry a lot with school, but you're really smart, so I guess what I'm trying to say is, don't be such a worrywart.
As strange a greeting as that was, I suddenly feel incredibly relieved.
Thanks, Sabrina.
And my aunts said nothing good would come of dropping in on dreams.
- Mr. Kraft.
- Not now, Spellman.
There is a situation in the teachers' lounge.
The school nurse fell asleep smoking and set fire to the couch again.
Oh, wait.
I just wanted to ask you, um, what would you call the colour of your tie?
Pea green?
No, absolutely not.
It's-- It's kelly green.
Well, I guess I'll see you at lunch today.
I hear the soup is split pea.
I think I need some air.
Peas!
Okay, that's the last time I ever use dream-dropping for my personal amusement again.
Geek.
Loser.
- Freak.
- Libby, congratulations.
You know, I hear you have enough credits to graduate now.
No more high school.
Woo hoo!
What?
That can't be true.
I have to talk to Mr. Kraft.
Oh, I think he's in the teachers' lounge.
Okay, there.
Out of my system.
- Harvey?
- Oh, hey, Sabrina.
- Didn't see you.
- Is everything okay?
I mean, I called you yesterday-- Yeah, well, I had to do this thing, at the place, with some people.
I'll call you later.
Okay, he's acting weird.
I wonder if the sandman could find out why.
Whoa.
What's this?
Smells like espresso.
You won't tell me what's bothering you, but maybe your subconscious will.
Salem, what are you doing in my bag?
And it better not be what I saw you doing in the Flanagans' sandbox.
No, your aunts asked me to tag along to make sure you don't Uh, what was it again?
I'm supposed to stop you from-- Wait, it'll come to me.
Nope.
Never tell me anything when I'm watching V.I.P. Since you're here, wanna pop into Harvey's dream?
Sure.
Maybe I'll think of it while we're there.
This is his dream?
I was a teenage boy once, and let me tell you, he's wasting a dream.
Hey, that's our French book.
I get it.
We have a huge French test tomorrow, and Harvey's probably afraid he's gonna fail.
That's why he's been acting weird.
It has nothing to do with me.
And denial is a river in Egypt.
I just made that one up.
I think that means he's happy he has his book back, or he lost his Slinky.
Maybe I should study.
See?
Look how peacefully he's sleeping now.
And I wouldn't let that thumb-sucking thing bother you.
Hey, Sabrina.
Guess what.
I think I aced my French test.
I knew that was bothering you.
I mean, congratulations.
Now that the stress of that test's behind you, - do you wanna go out after school--?
- Sabrina, no.
I can't go out with you after school.
You gotta stop asking me that.
I-- I don't think he's seeing anyone else.
Me neither.
So who do you think it is?
So the reason Harvey's been acting so weird toward me has absolutely nothing to do with his French test.
Dreams have to be interpreted.
They're symbolic.
Like when I'm dreaming of a thousand-pound tuna, I'm really dreaming about salmon.
But I don't know how to interpret dreams.
You don't, but my old buddy Sigmund Freud does.
Salem, for once you might be onto something.
Where am I?
I was just grabbing a quick bite between patients, und-- Hello, Sigmund.
I know that voice.
Saberhagen?
How's my wife?
Oh, that's right.
We weren't really friends.
Sabrina?
- The cops.
Get rid of him.
Why don't you hide in here for a few minutes?
And, um, try not to get mustard on anything.
Okay.
Yes?
Solve the family secret.
- Solve the family secret.
- What are you two doing?
What do you think we're doing?
I'm just sitting here trying to solve the family secret.
And I'm just batting at dust particles because I think they're real.
Uh-huh.
Well, this should help.
I managed to track down your cousin Stanislav.
He sent you another clue.
Oh, great.
Well, I'd better get back to solving this thing.
Thanks for the clue, and we'll see you later.
- Solve the family secret.
- Okay.
Bye-bye.
All right, let's get the shrink and go to Harvey's.
Well, is she working on it?
Probably not.
She has Freud hiding in the closet.
Freud?
That man will do anything to see me again.
You know, he might have a brilliant mind, but with me he's all hands.
See?
Something's obviously bothering him.
It couldn't be the crowd of people standing around him every night.
He's clearly having a very disturbing dream.
Though not as disturbing as the one I am having.
Yeah, yeah.
Tell it to Jung.
I think you accidentally zapped us into a Calvin Klein commercial.
- Hey, there's Harvey.
- Ah, but this is so easy to interpret.
That is Harvey's emotional baggage which he is struggling with.
Ah, and that-- That is his inner child.
He is usually at the table next to me in fine restaurants.
What's that?
That's a giant floating banana.
Clearly, Harvey's problem is that he is overwhelmed by all the pressure in his life.
Nothing that a lifetime of therapy won't take care of.
I don't have a lifetime.
How come he got a cone and I didn't?
See?
It worked.
Sleeping like a baby.
Though I might be a little concerned with that thumb-sucking.
What happened to Freud?
Uh Why do we still have daylight savings?
Your turn.
Fine.
My category is dream-dropping.
Oh, sorry.
It wasn't in the form of a question.
You're disqualified.
Night.
- Sabrina.
- Okay.
I know, I'm not supposed to do it anymore, but I was just trying to help Harvey out and I'm sure I didn't hurt anyone.
You obviously know better, Sabrina.
So you'll just have to live with the consequences.
Fine.
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's a school night.
Wait a minute.
What conse?
Sounds just like you before the surgery.
Hey, Valerie, how'd you do on the math homework last night?
I spent two hours on it this morning.
I didn't do it.
Why not?
Don't know.
Don't really care.
You should take your own advice and stop being such a worrywart.
Wait, wait.
I used the term "worrywart" and you actually listened to me?
- What's going on?
- They're committing Mr. Kraft.
Drama club wanted to put on The Princess and the Pea and he totally lost it.
So many peas.
Who's gonna count them all?
There are too many.
There are too many peas.
These can't be the consequences my aunts talked about.
This is a coincidence.
The man was a time bomb.
- Hey, Sabrina.
- Harvey, you're talking to me?
Yeah, well, I've been a little preoccupied lately.
But last night I had this dream, and when I woke up this morning everything was as clear as day.
Partially because it was day.
I knew you'd work it all out.
Sabrina, we've been going out for a long time and I feel like there's something I need to say.
Oh, you know you can tell me anything.
- I wanna break up with you.
- What?
!
I knew you were gonna make a scene.
I'm not making a scene.
This is not a scene.
What, haven't you ever seen anyone make a scene before?
So now, for no reason, my boyfriend wants to break up with me.
Okay, I admit it.
You were right.
I was wrong.
You smart.
Me dumb.
Now, please, please, please, help me fix it.
I'm sorry, honey, but there's nothing we can do.
You manipulated his subconscious.
We warned you this could happen.
Really?
Because I don't remember you warning me.
Warning, warning.
Danger, danger.
Now, maybe if you'd worn something like that, I would have paid attention.
Your time to solve the family secret has expired.
What?
Why didn't you tell me to work on the family secret?
Okay, well, just give me two seconds and I'll-- I'll figure it out right now.
Okay, I just got another clue yesterday.
Here it is.
It's a picture ofme?
In a very cheap frame.
Okay, let's see, um Every member of the Spellmans-- - Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes?
- Yes?
--are related to me.
Wrong.
Oh, who is this guy?
And now for the consequences.
I know, I know.
I don't get my witch's licence.
No, honey, it's worse than that.
You're now no longer a witch.
Wha--?
I lost my boyfriend and my magic all in one day?
- Don't forget your home.
- What?
!
I said the consequences were gonna be dire.
It's the suit, isn't it?
That's why no one takes me seriously.
Sabrina can stay here as long as she likes.
We love her whether she has magic or not.
You can't have a mortal living under your roof.
But don't worry.
It's not like we're just gonna turn her out into the cold.
- A $20 bill?
- Go easy.
It has to last you the rest of your life.
Aunt Hilda.
Aunt Zelda.
Ahh!
Aunt Hilda?
Aunt Zelda?
Wait a minute.
I'm lost and I really need to get home.
- Can you help me?
- Oh, sure.
- Do you have any money?
- Yeah.
I have $20.
- Not anymore.
- Wait.
Stop!
MAN 1: Hey, blondie.
This is my place.
If you wanna stretch out, use the grate by the wall.
It used to be Stinky's, but he's dead.
I lost my magic, my boyfriend, my home, my family.
All I have is a Chiclet and Stinky's grate.
MAN 2: Hey!
Stinky left me this grate in his will.
I'll sell it to you for a Chiclet.
Sorry.
I didn't know.
Ow.
A giant floating banana?
Wait a minute.
I'm Dreaming.
- Tell me it was all a dream.
- It was all a dream.
Harvey didn't break up with you and you still have your magic.
And your home.
We did it to show how destructive dream-dropping can really be.
And to try to motivate you to solve the family secret.
Who did you guys punish before I moved in?
I should have known it was all a dream when that annoying cone guy appeared.
Warning, warning.
Danger, danger.
Unfortunately, he's real.
Don't worry, Sabrina.
We're not gonna let him take you away.
- What's this?
- A strongly worded citation.
"You have 30 days to help Sabrina solve the family secret, or there will be a $25 fine".
This is your idea of dire?
Okay, maybe "dire" was a bit strong, but, hey, it really lit a fire under you gals.
You'll learn.
They're big on punishment.
I had to pay for that uniform.
- Hey.
Mystery's been solved.
- Hey.
I found out what Harvey's doing every day after school.
And I really think he owes you an explanation.
Oh, no, it is another girl.
Brace yourself.
Pork on a Pole?
There's no way I'm ever gonna look cute in this, is there?
No.
You would have thought the nightmare was punishment enough.
My aunts aren't making me do this.
I decided that a class ring is more important than my self-respect.
And I got the same shift as Harvey.
I still think you should have kept your sandman job.
Well, it was kind of hard once I heard the words "you're fired".
I guess they weren't big on dream-dropping.
I hope I can stay awake long enough to see who the new sandman is.
Yeah.
I wonder who took over.
Let the nightmare begin.
Don't-- Don't hurt me, sprout.
I'll count faster.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
I have something very important to tell you.
Something that could change all our lives forever.
- You're buying me a new car.
- You're having my baby.
- Stop it.
Let her talk.
- You see-- Oh, we're finally getting a cabana boy.
No.
Now, I know you're not going to like what I'm about to say, but be warned, I don't wanna hear it.
Say it.
Okay.
I think Willard Kraft is going to propose to me.
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Will you excuse us?
I heard that.
Who you calling chicken?
I was so excited about getting a job at the school store until I found out Mr. Kraft is gonna be my boss.
Well, I was so excited about life until I found out Mr. Kraft is gonna be my new stepuncle.
Your Aunt Zelda's marrying Mr. Kraft?
- It can't be.
- Oh, it be.
- I am so, so sorry.
- I've got a plan.
I'm gonna act as obnoxious as possible.
He won't wanna live with a troubled teen.
Sabrina, can I talk to you alone?
Sure.
If we can get rid of Miss Third Wheel over here.
Sorry, I was just trying to act obnoxious, you know, for Mr. Kraft.
Oh, good.
I was worried it was a new nickname.
Miss Third Wheel.
I like it.
So I have something important to tell you.
Harvey, your Adam's apple is quivering.
This is perfect.
Nice and quiet.
Sabrina, I  Anyways, Sabrina  I just wanna say that   Sabrina, I--  I give up.
Okay, well, let's get together and almost talk another time.
So as you may or may not know, next Saturday we're having our policemen's ball, - and I was wondering-- - Well, I'd love to go, um, Dale.
Ma'am, I'm selling tickets.
Oh.
Well, I'll take two.
Will there be firemen there?
- What you reading?
- Nothing.
Well, I'm off to the kitchen.
Today's Bride?
I accidentally picked it up instead of Omni.
Zelda.
Excuse me.
Zelda, darling, as your bridal consultant, I insist you make some decisions.
Ice sculpture or chocolate fountain?
Both would be gauche.
And when did Salem become Mr. Salem?
I just want a simple garden ceremony.
Honey, if we're going that route, let's just book a polka band.
Am I the only one unwilling to overlook the obvious?
That Salem is fired?
Huh?
No.
Obvious fact number one: Willard hasn't asked you to marry him yet.
And obvious fact number two-- You said, "number two".
Willard is unfortunately still in love with me.
I don't know why you wanna marry a man who's pining after your sister.
You forgot to mention obvious fact number three: You're nuts.
Do you have any idea what Harvey was trying to tell me?
Do you mind?
I need a notebook that doesn't clash with my sweater.
- Today.
- That'll be $1.95.
I hate to ask you this, but could I pay you later?
I spent all my allowance on my cousin's prosthetic leg.
Oh, Libby, that's so sad.
Yeah, I'll write you an IOU.
I don't think she's gonna pay you back.
- Why?
- Well, there's her lame excuse, the fact that she's Libby-- - She bought the cousin story.
- And that.
Hey, there.
Hey.
Hey.
There's future Uncle Mr. Kraft.
I wish my Aunt Zelda realised what a villain he is.
I know.
I get woozy every time he heads my way.
Is he heading my way?
Yep.
Time to put my most obnoxious foot forward.
Well, I just scored a shipment of used computer-science books.
There haven't been that many technological advances since the '50s.
Yeah?
You and what army?
Okay, that wasn't obnoxious.
That was just stupid.
Maybe Mr. Kraft won't wanna live with an idiot.
Now, what makes you so sure that Willard is going to propose?
Look, there have been many hints.
If you don't believe me, just bake a wedding-indicator cake.
Good idea.
The proposal hints We will review Does this schlub Wanna marry you?
Zoo-zoo, there is something personal I've been working up the courage to ask you.
- Okay, monkey, what is it?
- Now, be patient, my love.
First, you must meet Grammy Kraft, so she can give us her blessings.
Blessings?
She's probably a lady of the cloth.
Please, just give me a teensy-weensy little cluey wooey.
Well, let's just say that this spring might be a pretty busy time for us.
Spring.
Spring wedding?
Spring bride?
Get it?
Hello.
The man has not gotten over me.
Willard.
Not to worry.
The rosette broke my fall.
Do you see the way he's looking at me?
Okay.
I'll take your IOU, but you have to sign it.
Here you go.
Have a nice day, "Obi-Wan Ken" Hey.
Hey, Valerie, I need to talk to you about Sabrina.
Harvey, your Adam's apple's quivering.
I wanna tell her something.
Something I've never told another girl before, but I can't get the words out.
Well, what is it?
I love you.
Aw.
You do know I meant Sabrina, right?
That is so sweet.
You've gotta tell her.
What if she doesn't say it back?
I'll be devastated.
I gotta go.
Whatever you do, don't tell Sabrina anything.
Harvey wanted to say "I love you".
He's never said it to another girl.
Harvey loves me?
Harvey Kinkle loves me?
It sounds better without Kinkle, doesn't it?
Yeah.
But, look, he's afraid that you won't say it back.
Of course I'd say it back.
I feel it back.
So you're sure she'll say it back?
Well, how do you know?
It'sa girl thing.
Then I'll tell her this Friday.
That'll give me time to get a haircut.
- This Friday?
- Yes, but you know nothing.
Have I lost my mind, or should you two hens be in class?
Okay, that was a perfect chance for you to be obnoxious.
I've changed tacks.
If I can find one thing I can stand about Mr. Kraft, one tiny, little thing, I can focus on that, and that'll get me through to college.
Just what part of "tuck your shirt in" don't you understand?
Well, he doesn't hit.
One tiny little thing.
Ow, ow, ow.
You mean, meow.
- A little cat humour.
- Very little.
I've got a hangnail on my pointing finger.
Oh, that's wonderful.
You might wanna work on your bedside manner.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just I'm relieved your magic is out.
Willard and his grandmother are coming to dinner tonight, and you won't be able to use your magic to spoil the evening.
She's still got a mouth.
I think he's going to propose.
He said he's bringing a very special box.
Probably pine lined in satin.
Move.
I know I can find something I like about Willard Kraft.
I know I can.
Miss Birkhead, you get these deadbeats to pay up, or it is coming out of your own paycheque.
What?
Oh, please, save your tears for debtors' prison.
Move.
He has no odour to speak of.
Harvey, I'd love to go out on Friday.
I mean, how are you?
Fine.
So I was wondering, wanna go out on Friday?
- Okay.
- Okay.
Excuse me, I have to go visit Lake Valerie.
Now, what should I make for dessert?
No, it looks like I'm trying too hard.
- Me like pie.
- Pie.
Marvellous.
Grammy Kraft is bound to like one of these.
Hangnail.
Caught.
Help.
Hold still.
Oh!
Thanks.
Could you zip me up, please?
Gladly.
I meant the dress.
I love you.
I love you.
- I love you.
I love you too.
If you loved me, you'd knock.
- So, what's new?
- Eh, not much.
Got a letter from Mom, killed a plant, and overheard that Mr. Kraft is asking for Zelda's hand in marriage tonight.
Tonight?
I need air.
That did absolutely nothing.
Aunt Hilda, is it true?
I thought we had more time.
I know.
He's marrying Zelda to get back at me.
- The ultimate revenge.
- What are we gonna do?
I've done everything.
I even stooped so low I tried to see the good.
I guess we just have to accept it, and envision ourselves as one big, happy family.
I'll take Jan Brady to block.
Why does Mr. Kraft have to rear his ugly head?
I should be looking forward to my date, and those words that'll make it the happiest day ever.
- What's happening Friday?
- Nothing.
I want everything to be just perfect.
There.
We're going to have a lovely supper, and then afterwards, you'll wheel Grammy Kraft into our new handicap bathroom.
You do that for him, and yet I can't have a racquetball court?
And then Willard will ask me to be his wife, and I'll say yes, and everything will be wonderful, and we will all live tolerantly ever after.
They're here.
I hope I look okay.
She's so excited.
We've only been thinking about ourselves.
Well, you're just a teenager, and I'm me.
I know, but, look, we can't ruin it for her, okay?
We've gotta make a pact.
We won't say a word no matter what Willard Kraft says.
No matter how offensive or vile.
Hello.
- Well, that's my breaking point.
- Mine too.
Well, I guess we should shut the door.
There's a real storm brewing.
- Well, where's Grammy Kraft?
- She's coming.
She always insists on driving her own car despite the legal blindness.
We are still going to have a family dinner, though, aren't we?
Oh, yes.
Hilda and Sabrina just went upstairs to check on their ant farm.
Their workers are trying to unionise.
There's gotta be a way for us to keep quiet through dinner.
I know a "mum's the word" spell, but my magic's still out.
Oh, I'd be happy to shut your mouth.
Hey, you know what I mean.
Okay.
Here it is.
So nothing unkind Will be heard Just remember Mum's the word Okay, let's do a test.
Sorry, Hilda, my heart belongs to Zoo-zoo.
- Mum.
- That's great, Aunt Hilda.
Mum.
Is that all you can say?
What a stupid spell.
Oh, okay.
I think I'm gonna go with "if you can't say anything nice" spell.
"To enact spell, press here".
Cripes, shut your pie hole.
Yeah, that's more like it.
And you don't think we should have waited for Grammy Kraft?
No.
No, she's a slow driver, and she's always stopping for hitchhikers.
Listen.
Are you gonna finish those potatoes?
- Mum.
- You're right.
They are good.
Sabrina, you've been awfully quiet, and that's greatly appreciated, but why don't you tell us about school?
Yeah, I'd love to hear about that ant farm.
Yeah, I think Grammy's really gonna like you.
And later on, I wanna get you alone, and finally ask you that question.
You have a question for me?
Gosh, I wonder what that could be.
Sabrina, I have something to say to you, and it can't wait till Friday.
Yes, I know my Adam's apple's quivering.
I have to get this off my chest, and please don't say anything until I finish.
You don't need to take notes.
I'll be brief.
Sabrina, I love you.
Jump in any time here.
I should have known a girl like you wouldn't love a guy like me.
It's nice to hear the sound of my own voice.
La, la, la, la-- I gather you want an explanation.
Did you put a silent spell on you and Hilda?
Well, when you incant two silent spells under one roof, everything under the roof becomes a silent movie.
Why didn't it kick in when you cast the spells?
Because.
Why am I so worthless?
That's just rude.
Sabrina?
I can't find my car keys.
Sabrina, I sure hope you know what I should do about Mr. Kraft.
Hey, we're in colour.
And I can talk.
Just reminding myself to appreciate the little things.
Sabrina, I just want you to know that I understand if you don't feel the same way about-- Harvey I love you.
Really?
Cool.
Very cool.
So now that we've got that out of our systems, would you excuse me for a minute?
Would you excuse us a minute?
Excuse us.
Miss Birkhead?
Are you having any luck recouping those IOUs?
I'm selling my kidney on eBay.
So the movie ended just because Harvey and I kissed?
Whoo!
Sabrina, a silent movie always ends with a kiss.
Or some wacky outtakes.
I can't believe I spent half my special evening over-gesturing.
I'm sorry, Aunt Zelda.
We just didn't wanna say anything that would ruin your big moment.
But thankfully, my mistake showed you that Mr. Kraft really is a villain.
Uh-huh.
And Harvey really is a Mountie.
It was just a movie.
Are you upset just because you weren't the lead?
- Everyone, continue enjoying pie.
- You bet.
- Except you.
- What?
What?
Well, we're finally alone.
Uh-huh.
So, what was this question you wanted to ask me?
Yes, there is a question.
Would you mind getting down on one knee?
Oh.
No.
Oh, Zoo-zoo, my dear.
Will you?
Will youdo my taxes?
Receipts?
I've waited my whole life for this?
You know, for some reason I thought the night we proclaimed our love would be more romantic.
Me too, but this is good pie.
Aunt Zelda, I'm sorry things didn't turn out the way you wanted them to.
Well, it all worked out.
Willard and I talked, and once we cleaned the shards of glass out of his moustache, he asked me to go steady.
So you are happy for me?
Oh, we're just happy you're not getting married.
Did my silent-movie spell turn into a horror-movie spell?
No, it's just another relative with another clue to the family secret.
Oh, I see the family resemblance.
Aunt Hilda, you look just like Fay Wray.
- You think?
- Fay Wray is the clue, but we are related to Kong.
He's a third cousin with a pituitary problem.
Oh, okay, so I've got Fay, a picture of me, and a picture of Robert E. Lee.
Fay, me, Lee.
Family.
So the Spellman family secret is about the Spellman family.
I got nothing.
Sure, I'd love to hang out with you guys.
Call the Air Force.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Sabrina, we have good news and bad news.
The bad news is we're going to a family reunion.
- The good news is-- - It's not our family?
No.
The family reunion is in Hawaii.
All right.
I wonder what the weather's like in Hawaii right now.
Well, let's see.
Okay, well, that answers my question.
I will not pack galoshes.
Can I help you with those bags under your eyes?
- Who's this?
I'd like to introduce you to my new friend, Lola.
I met her outside my favourite sushi bar.
We were fighting over a tuna belly, and she won.
Salem got beat by a girl.
Salem got beat by a woman, Sabrina.
She's in the family way.
- Maybe we should have him neutered.
- I heard that.
And for your information, I'm not the father.
But she will be staying with us until the blessed event.
Didn't I ask for milk?
Harvey?
Harvey.
I'm coming, Mom.
Oh, man.
Okay.
Nothing to see here.
Show's over.
Harvey, if you keep falling asleep, they're gonna transfer you to the narcolepsy magnet school.
I know.
But my dad's away, and according to my mom, pregnant women need soy hot cocoas brought to them every half hour throughout the night.
Well, are you sure your mom's pregnant and not just lazy?
I need a break.
- Thinking about joining the Army.
- Hey, I have an idea.
We need someone to watch Salem while we go on our family reunion to Hawaii.
I'll do it.
I'll pay you.
Great.
Oh, wait.
We have another cat, and she's pregnant.
Does she sit around and moan about her varicose veins?
- Not so far.
- When do I start?
Harvey?
You got a mortal to stay with us?
So, what if I need something for Lola?
How am I supposed to let him know?
Charades?
Come-hither stares?
What if I put a spell on Harvey?
That way you two can talk to each other.
You've done that spell before?
No, but I can.
I discovered it while studying the magic book.
Studying the magic book?
Who are you and what have you done with Sabrina?
Harvey, this is Lola.
She mostly just wants to be left alone.
An excellent quality in a pregnant thing.
Sabrina, we'd better get going.
Oh, I just wanted to make Harvey a farewell drink.
Farewell.
- Dolittle spell?
- Bleh.
Dolittle.
I didn't know Kool-Aid came in chunky style.
Oh, Harvey, you remember Salem, don't you?
- Hey, Harv.
- Hey, Salem.
Anything on TV?
SportsCenter.
You get the chips, I'll get the remote.
You're on.
Have a great time.
Okay, well, I hope we don't miss our flight.
I mean, it's rush hour.
The highways will be jammed.
I love that joke.
Wow.
For the first time in my life I understand the meaning of the word "swank".
Hold it.
This is Hilda's and my room.
Your room is through there.
My own room?
What a great reunion.
I don't care if I do have to kiss Aunt Bootsie.
I'm calling management.
There's something we need to tell you about this trip, dear.
You can't enjoy the beach until you solve the family secret.
What?
When were you planning on telling me this?
- Now.
- Don't worry.
You'll solve it.
It'll be easy once you have the final clue.
I am Pele, Hawaiian goddess of fire.
Cousin Pele, to you.
I am here to give you the final clue to the Spellman family secret.
Oh!
Oh!
Would some baking soda help?
That's okay.
Just don't talk.
It distracts me.
Here is your clue.
- Is it on fire?
- No.
I lost more clues that way.
Here.
Good luck.
A ball of string.
Okay, well, I'll just call room service and ponder over this while I have a burger and some free movies.
Sorry.
No food.
No fun.
You have to work on it until you get the answer.
I just wanna thank you two for bringing me to Hawaii.
If you have any questions, call us.
We'll be at the luau after hula lesson.
I need to learn to hula too.
Oh, that won't be too distracting.
Of course RoboCop can beat the Terminator, Mr. "I liked My Best Friend's Wedding".
I said it had its moments.
Do you want your tummy rubbed?
Oh, go back to sleepy.
Did you ever see Rambo?
Remember the part when he stitched himself up?
You know, I read Stallone really did that.
- You did your homework, right?
- Right.
What homework?
Uh!
Hilda At the last family reunion, you managed to alienate everyone because you hadn't even read the family newsletter.
Oh, it wasn't that bad.
- They made you eat sand.
- Not a lot.
Anyway, here comes Uncle George.
Now, he's at the reunion with his second wife, Ruby.
I don't know what he sees in her.
But be sure to compliment her on her supposed weight loss.
Hello, Zelda.
Hello, Ruby.
You've lost weight.
Oh, look.
I think they're towing my car.
Every member of the Spellman family is born with a ball of string?
No.
With, a-- With stringy hair.
No.
We condition.
- Hello?
Sabrina, help.
Harvey and I are beside ourselves.
Lola won't stop crying.
I have problems of my own.
I have to solve this stupid secret with this stupid ball of string.
If you come home, I'll help you--  - With the clue.
- What is this?
Salem?
What did the doctor say?
The doctor on the telephone, yeah, said Lola needs a nesting spot.
Go get a cardboard box and set it up in the living room.
- Run, man.
- Okay.
But leave Lola in here.
The box is supposed to be a surprise.
You're a very controlling vet.
Good going.
Okay.
This is my last clue, a ball of string.
That's not string.
It's twine.
Oh, please let me at it.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Well, I was taking a walk, and suddenly I got very tired.
Mrs. Kinkle.
I gotta get out of here.
But you haven't helped Lola.
Right.
Until this cat gives birth to a litter Make her calm and relaxed For her new cat-sitter  She's fixed.
I have to admit that sound was beginning to annoy me.
I'll find out, Mom.
Gotta go.
Salem, do we have any soy hot cocoa?
How do you get all the sand out?
Just keep rinsing.
Shell.
Hmm.
Twine.
Okay.
Every member of the Spellman family is born with twine.
With wine?
I come from long line of alcoholics?
No.
Every member of the Spellman family is born with a twine.
Minus the "e" is "twin".
That's it!
Every member of the Spellman family is born with a twin.
A twin?
Congratulations, Sabrina.
You solved the family secret.
Come here.
I'd like to introduce you to your twin, Katrina.
- Hello, Sabrina.
- I'm so excited.
And, apparently, not unique.
I can't believe I have a twin.
This is good news, especially if one of us ever needs a kidney.
Katrina lives in South Dakota in a house exactly like ours.
Except for some reason, they have shag.
Katrina and I had a great time together yesterday.
It's weird we don't have the same parents.
Are your twins as nice as mine?
Actually, our twins turned out to be evil.
Which brings us to another teeny thing we have to tell you.
Zelda.
Sit down, dear.
You see, in all witch twins, one twin is evil, and the other one is good.
And, unfortunately, the evil twin is not allowed to live in the Mortal Realm.
Oh, no.
Katrina can't be the evil one.
Wait a minute.
That would mean I'm the evil one.
She did leave the pool boy a crummy tip.
I got this scar wrestling a monkey at the county fair.
Sweet.
But I got you beat.
Check out the one on my butt.
I don't see a scar.
Don't have one, but made you look.
MRS.
Oh, fiddlesticks.
Mom, what are you doing?
I'm trying to get into Lola's nesting box, but I think I need a bigger one.
Order on the beach.
In today's case of Katrina v. Sabrina, the tribunal shall decide which witch is the good witch, and which witch is the evil witch.
Stop biting your nails.
I will if you stop twirling your hair.
Question one: Sabrina.
Oh, hey, buddy.
Where's your tag?
Are you lost?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Does this dog belong to anyone?
- Sabrina, pay attention to the question.
- Sorry.
What did you say?
I can't repeat the question.
Oh, then, yellow?
Katrina, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Well, I like people and animals, so I'll either be a social worker or a veterinarian.
Wrong.
Sabrina wins the question portion.
You see, the good witch cares more about living things than about winning points for herself.
- Woohoo!
- I hated those trick questions.
I'm so embarrassed.
I gave that round to Katrina.
Now, we shall randomly review each witch's use of magic.
Was it for good?
Or was it for evil?
Roll the videotape.
Not her best magic.
And who picked that music?
Dressing Harvey was good magic.
He looked like a total dork before.
But I mean "dork" in the best possible way.
You didn't dress Harvey to help him.
You did it to win the contest.
Dressing Harvey was selfish.
Worst Spellman family trait.
Now we shall review Katrina's use of magic.
I knew I should have learned to cook.
Pies for the homeless.
How nutritious.
I think those children were being read to against their will.
So far, Sabrina has won the q and a, and Katrina has won the life review.
But since this is a close call, I have one more question which could make it or break it for either one of you.
- May the best witch win.
- Right back at you.
I would like each girl to quickly tell the tribunal how she used her magic for good in the last 24 hours.
Oh, I made a pregnant animal feel comfortable.
Katrina?
Anything?
Well, I-- I got us both dates.
Court's adjourned.
Last one to limbo is a rotten egg.
Great.
I'm ahead.
Maybe I'm not the evil one after all.
Oh, this trial is getting on my nerves.
I have a bigger headache than Uncle Danny after he celebrates.
Well, another night of drinking.
Hello, Zelda.
Hello, Uncle Danny.
Oh, there goes my car again.
I'm good.
I know I am.
Or am I?
I wonder if there's a competent therapist on this island.
- Hello?
- Sabrina, we need you here now.
Harvey's mom's in labour at the hospital.
And you need me to offer hearty congratulations?
No.
When doctors listened to her stomach, they heard a heartbeat and something that sounds like purring.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Looks like "Inexact Spell" Spellman has struck again.
I'll meet you at the hospital.
Sand goes down better the second time, don't you think?
I understand your not stopping them, but did you have to scream out, "More, more, she can take it"?
You think we should check on Sabrina?
Oh, no.
No, let her relax.
Look out.
Coming through.
Okay.
I transferred Lola's discomfort onto the nearest pregnant creature.
- Mrs. Kinkle.
- Exactly.
She's about to have kittens unless I get her and Lola together, and incant a spell.
So do we give up now or carry this charade a beat longer?
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mrs. Kinkle.
She's about to deliver.
Then I guess she might be in the delivery room.
No need to be snotty.
That was evil.
Don't tell the judge.
Relax, Ma.
They'll stick a needle in your spine and it'll be all better.
Dr. Merchant, let's hear the foetal heartbeat and the so-called purring.
Oh, my.
Is this what I think it is?
Yes.
Barbecue sauce.
We had ribs for lunch, remember?
Right.
Let's go wash up.
We'll be right back.
Harvey, get me a Nutrageous bar.
I'm on it, Ma.
Mrs. Kinkle, holding a kitty is the latest relaxation technique to ease contraction pains.
I'd chew steel right now.
Please make this work.
Mom.
They didn't have Nutrageous in the vending machine.
I had to get crackers.
Try the one in the basement.
And take the stairs.
I'm on it.
Well, this isn't going smoothly.
And here come the doctors.
There was a spell that went wrong Put these kitties back Where they belong All right.
It's time to deliver the baby.
Doctor, do you think it's appropriate to bring animals into the delivery room?
You mean, Dr. Fluffy from the HMO?
Whoo!
I'm glad I was able to fix that little glitch.
Helping Lola's the magic that's gonna tip me off into the good-witch category.
I hate to burst your bubble, but didn't you help Lola just so I'd help you with the clue?
Oh, no.
You're right.
And that was selfish.
And being selfish is a Spellman's worst trait.
- I'm evil.
- And doomed.
Do either of you have a candy bar on you?
I can't find the basement.
- Sabrina?
- Hey, Harvey.
Aren't you supposed to be in Hawaii?
Without a moustache?
Oh, right.
Tail winds?
Look, Harvey, there's something I have to tell you.
- I won't be able to see you anymore.
- Why?
Because I won't be allowed to live in Westbridge.
We're just so crazy about Hawaii, we're moving there.
Well, what am I gonna do without you?
Mr. Kinkle.
Your mother's asking for you.
It turns out the purring was just a glitch on the sonogram.
- Sabrina, I-- MRS.
Harvey!
Please don't go?
I'll miss you.
Me too.
Me three.
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to get rid of that Dr. Dolittle spell.
Why?
Just because you're evil doesn't mean I shouldn't continue my friendship with Harvey.
Well, I'm a wreck.
Oh, now, now, dear.
Just because your spell was selfish.
And involved civil disobedience.
And was very messy, doesn't mean you're the evil twin.
Order on the sand.
Since Sabrina's helping-a- pregnant-cat spell was selfish, involved civil disobedience and was extremely messy, the evil twin is Sabrina Spellman.
Great.
I finally win something.
Why are we at a volcano?
I thought I couldn't live in the Mortal Realm.
Well, actually, dear, you can't live in the Mortal Realm or the Other Realm.
We didn't wanna worry you.
And besides, I never thought you'd turn out to be the evil one.
Especially when you turned out to be the good one.
It was nice getting to know you.
Good luck with the rest of your future.
Sorry.
What does she mean by that?
Evil twins are thrown into the volcano.
Oh, to prove that they're brave, and then they'll be welcomed back into the bosom of their family?
Not exactly.
Zelda.
You see, Sabrina, lava is the only substance that can-- I'm sorry.
Lava is the only substance that can destroy a witch.
Get me the ACLU.
At this time, the good twin shall push the evil twin into the volcano.
Okey-dokey.
Aah!
- Oh, no.
She didn't.
Why did you push Sabrina into the volcano?
Because you told me to.
Duh.
No good witch has ever had the heart to do away with their evil twin.
Although, one Hilda Spellman did come very close.
This proves Katrina is the evil twin.
Great.
With my luck, it's a telemarketer.
- Yes?
- Good news.
Mrs. Kinkle delivered a healthy baby girl, and Lola had five little kittens.
Uh-huh.
What's that loud noise in the background?
Oh, that would be hot, molten lava.
I'm gonna have to get back to you.
Sabrina, we've got good news for a change.
You're not the evil twin.
Now you tell me.
Oh, man, have you ever tried to wash volcanic ash out of your hair?
No.
But I came really close, as the witch judge pointed out to practically everyone in Hawaii.
So, what happened to Katrina?
She was sent to live in the Twin Cities in the Other Realm.
That's where all the evil twins go after the volcano test.
I thought evil twins died.
No one's actually ever thrown to their death during the volcano test.
Well, except for you.
Well, we all have our 15 minutes.
Well, here it is.
Your official witch's licence.
It will give you more power than you ever dreamed possible.
But be careful.
It can also cause more trouble than you ever dreamed possible.
Just ask Hilda.
Not all tsunamis are bad.
And now, we have one final lesson for you.
Well, this seems a tad anticlimactic now.
Oh, your skirt's on fire.
Their names are Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo and Pepe.
"Pepe"?
What happened to "Gummo"?
Gummo was my father's name.
Hey.
Chocolate cigars to celebrate the birth of my new baby sister, Oona.
Oona Kinkle.
I hope she's good-looking.
Hey, I have a big favour to ask you.
Can I take Lola and the kittens home?
Oona stops crying when there's meowing, - but it's making me hoarse.
- They're all yours.
Meow!
Oh, but can Salem come visit every other weekend?
Sure.
That way we can watch RoboCop together.
Why did I say that?
- Because you're sleep-deprived.
- Right.
I better get home.
I'll come back for Lola.
- I'm so glad you're not leaving after all.
- Me too.
Are you okay?
Sure.
I mean, we knew we couldn't keep them.
I just--  I'm feeling a little postpartum.
I could use a vacation.
How about Maui?
