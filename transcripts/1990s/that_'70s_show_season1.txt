{START OF EPISODE 1}
Eric.
It is time.
Why don't you do it?
- It's your house.
- Your house.
Listen to them up there.
The party has reached critical mass.
In 10 minutes, there will be no more beer opportunities.
If my dad catches me copping beers, he'll kill me.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Don't worry about it.
Just remain calm, keep moving.
And above all, don't get sucked into my dad's hair.
- What's wrong with your dad's hair?
- Just don't look at it.
And, Eric, cold.
Definitely cold.
Young and beautiful Someday your looks will be gone Watch it, Eric!
Hot pizza rolls.
Coming through.
Hot, hot.
Kitty, where are you?
Okay, take two.
There's plenty.
There's plenty coming.
Is everybody good?
I know.
I know.
Vienna sausages are so versatile.
Hi, there, Eric.
Mr. Pinciotti.
So, Eric, how do you like Bob's new hair?
Isn't it groovy?
It's incredibly groovy, Mrs. Pinciotti.
- Yeah, it was Midge's idea.
- It's a perm.
Eric.
Hi, Dad.
What the hell happened to Bob's hair?
Beats me.
His head looks like a poodle's ass.
Boy, just when you think you've seen everything.
- A poodle's ass walks into your party.
- Eric, don't use the "ass" word.
You're still in high school.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
Pigs in a blanket.
Hot.
Hot.
Kitty, is that your Toyota in the drive?
Red, a Toyota?
Yeah, it's mine.
I tell you, the last time I was that close to a Japanese machine it was shooting at me.
Honey, it is the gas crisis.
What can you do?
And you know, Bob, those SOBs at the dealership offered me a lousy $400 trade-in on the Vista Cruiser.
Yeah, what you gonna do?
It'll rust in the driveway before I trade it in.
Honey, it is rusting in the driveway.
Pop, I'll take the cruiser off your hands.
I don't care if it's a pump-sucker.
- What you got there, Eric?
- Beer.
I found it.
Just sitting you know around.
Put them away, son.
I intend to, sir.
Honey.
On your way to the basement, could you pop these in the fridge?
They're warm.
Check it out.
I see that every day.
He's alive!
Good news.
My dad is thinking of giving me the Vista Cruiser.
You're getting a car?
Have I told you how incredibly attractive you are, Eric?
No.
You told me he was cute.
No, I didn't.
I remember, 'cause you said not to say anything in front of Eric.
Let's focus on what's important here, people.
Forman stole something.
To Forman.
You know what's sad?
This is the proudest day of my life.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Marcia, a football in the face.
- That's gotta hurt.
- Ouch, my nose!
- That's gonna be huge in the morning.
- Huger than my boobs?
Bigger than the left one.
Why are we watching this without the sound?
I am totally confused.
Here, use the earphone.
So, what's the deal with the Vista Cruiser?
The deal is, there is no deal yet.
- How we gonna get to the concert?
- Shut up!
What concert?
Todd Rundgren.
When?
- This weekend.
- Who's going?
Eric, and Donna, and me, and Hyde, and the foreign kid Fez.
Pretty much everybody.
- And you.
- Good.
Thank you for telling me, Michael.
- I'm getting a soda.
- Yeah.
Yep, me, too.
Sit down!
You don't want me to go to the concert.
Is that it?
I didn't know if you liked music.
Michael.
I didn't invite you to the concert because I know you really don't like my friends.
- Did you tell them that?
- No.
Michael.
Don't tell our private conversations to other people.
We have to have our own private conversations.
Also, I didn't think you'd be interested in Todd Rundgren.
I mean, like you said, he's no Frampton.
I love Todd Runddamen.
I have the 45 of Hello, it's me.
Remember the night we listened to it?
We can have fun at the concert, too.
Especially in the car on the way back.
- Okay.
You can go.
- Only if you want me to.
I want you to.
Jackie, I guess you're going to the concert with us.
I can't wait.
So, Michael, you wanna go back to my house and listen to Todd Grunion records?
Yeah, sure.
Okay, bye.
You kids have fun.
Bye.
- Bye, bye, now.
- Yeah.
They're so darn cute.
Minute you turn your back, they go at it like dogs.
- They're frisky.
- You can't leave them alone.
No.
You know my sister thinks that we shouldn't be left alone.
Us?
Yeah.
We're alone now.
Yeah.
Eric, relax.
We've lived next door to each other forever.
You could've had me when I was four.
Really?
And there I was all day long on the hippity hop.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Stupid.
Ever since yesterday, I can't stop thinking about you.
I mean, I've known you practically my whole life.
I want you.
I want you so bad.
Eric, it's a car.
Let's just leave these two kids alone.
Say, hey there, Donna.
Hey, Dad.
You kids.
Standing around the driveway.
It's so darn cute.
You know, you may not realize it but this is the most fun you're ever gonna have.
- So it's all downhill from here, sir?
- Yeah.
- What happened to your dad's hair?
- He got a permanent.
So that's permanent?
Baby!
I may not say this right because I am new to English.
But she has tremendous breasts, yes?
Michael, who is this guy?
That's Fez.
He's a foreign exchange student.
Who did we exchange for him?
Donna, I have to go to the ladies' room.
Donna?
I, too, must go to the bathroom.
Eric?
No, it doesn't work that way with guys.
Kelso, how much longer are we gonna have to deal with the whole Jackie experience?
Don't worry.
I'm breaking up with her.
- Never gonna happen.
- It's over.
She's cutting into my free time.
I I'm hooked on a feeling I'm high on believing So is Red still thinking about giving you the car maybe?
Even if we do get it, we're gonna need some serious gas money 'cause the cruiser's a boat.
I know it's a boat.
This whole gas shortage bites.
Who is getting a boat?
There is no gas shortage, man.
It's all fake.
The oil companies control everything.
Like, there's this guy who invented this car that runs on water, man.
It's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine, and it runs on water.
So it is a boat.
No, it's a car.
Only, you put water in the gas tank instead of gas.
And it runs on water, man.
I never heard of this car.
Jackie's good for gas money.
You are such a whore.
When does the boat get here, whore?
Eric!
Yeah, dad.
I need to talk to you.
Eric your mother and I have been talking.
Since I've been cut back to part-time at the plant and the hospital is so close I can take the Toyota to work, and your mom can take the bus.
Honey.
Honey, really, I'd rather walk.
When I ride the bus in my nurse's uniform, people always show me their scars.
Then I'll drop you off on my way to the plant.
- No, I don't wanna be any trouble.
- Then Eric can take you.
He's a teenager.
He doesn't wanna drop If he can't drop his own mother off at work, then I'll be damned if he's getting a car!
Okay.
Excuse me.
- Am I getting the car?
- We didn't say that.
Things don't just drop into your lap, Eric.
Not in this life.
A car is a responsibility.
You'll need insurance.
Do you have any idea how much insurance is?
A car is a privilege.
Oil changes, road flares, fluids, that's your job.
A car is not a bedroom on wheels.
Always yield.
Always!
Laurie's friend got pregnant in a car.
Don't let that happen.
If I find one beer can in that car, it's over.
And no doughnuts, either.
Ants.
So do I get the car?
- Bitching!
- Eric, not in front of your mother.
Thank you, Pop.
Sir.
Yeah clean the attic.
- Kelso, that's sweet.
- Actually, I'm riding shotgun.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not riding in the back.
Why don't we let Eric decide?
- Eric?
- Kelso.
Get in the back.
- Taking her for a spin?
- Yes, sir.
Have a good time.
One more thing.
Very important.
About the car.
She's old, so no trips out of town.
Ever.
Understood?
Have fun.
I guess that's that.
We're not going.
- Eric, do you wanna go?
- He said no trips out of town.
- It's your car.
Do you wanna go?
- But he's God.
I think God would want us to go to Milwaukee.
Eric, you are a 17-year-old man.
I'm gonna go with whatever you say.
It's your decision.
It is my decision.
And my decision is: - We're going to a concert.
- Yeah!
The kids are off.
I wonder where they're going.
Out of town.
Are you sure?
Of course.
I told them not to.
So I guess they'll be gone for a while.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm telling you, we're out of gas.
- We're not out of gas.
- It's the battery.
- It's six years old and shot to hell.
- I know what.
I'll just call my dad.
Kelso, tell her.
- He can't take the car out of town.
- I'm not calling his dad.
Jackie, parents talk to each other about how we screw up.
- Why would they talk about that?
- They can't help it.
Look, say there's a party, see.
And all of our parents are there.
Together.
Hi, Red.
Say, isn't it great all our kids are such good friends?
Yes, Jackie's dad, they're quite the gang of young people.
Kitty, I love what you've done with the kitchen.
Yes, aqua and yellow blah, blah, blah, yak, yak, yak.
Speaking of kids wasn't it lucky Triple-A pulled Eric's butt out of the fire when he took the car to Milwaukee without your permission?
What?
Why, that twisted little monkey!
I'm grounding him for 10 years.
Kids.
What are you gonna do?
I say we torture them with plenty of pointless rules and advice.
Hey, everybody!
Let's hustle!
Guys.
We are in the middle of nowhere and I have to go to the ladies' room.
Donna?
So where you going?
- Rundgren concert.
- Cool.
So what, you want a battery?
'Cause I can get you a battery.
Are they cheap?
Or possibly free?
$32, minimum.
All right, I'll tell you what.
We'll trade you our battery, plus $5 for one of your batteries.
That's a really sweet deal, my friend, but how about this?
How about one battery for two concert tickets?
We can't give up two tickets.
Okay.
It's either that or none of us go.
- So who's out?
- There's always Jackie.
Of course, Jackie.
I mean, Jackie's gone.
But who else?
I don't know.
Jackie's date?
Come on!
You know I'm breaking up with her.
- You guys are chumping me out.
- I've had to listen to her for a good hour.
A really long hour.
God hates me.
How can you say God hates you?
At least you have a woman's love.
Be happy, whore.
This suit is for leisure.
But many times I wear it to get down to business.
Guys.
Randy's date is a man.
I'm okay with it.
We are so cool to be okay with it.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Kevin?
I'll explain later.
This isn't working.
No, it's a Boy Scout belt.
The buckle's got a thing you No.
Michael, before you speak, please hear my words.
I think we should break up.
- Now?
- You're not having a good time.
- I'm having a good time.
- Really?
Yeah.
Michael, I am so glad you don't wanna break up.
You were so nice to give your ticket away, so you could be with me.
Yeah.
That says you don't need music concerts friends.
You know what you need, Michael?
- I don't know.
- Me.
M-E, Michael.
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.
You're just too shy to say that, lover.
So when were you a Boy Scout?
What a great night.
You know, it's amazing what one act of civil disobedience can do for you.
I mean, there's a whole world that's waiting to be driven to.
We could go to Canada.
We got a new battery, what's stopping us?
You know, I think Canada closes at 9:30.
Yeah.
You know, I never would have done this if you hadn't talked me into it.
I didn't talk you into anything.
I'm gonna call it a day.
Good night.
Night.
By the way, thanks for the ride.
What was that for?
I just wanted to see what it was like.
What was it like?
You were there.
Yeah, I wasn't ready for it.
What would you have done differently?
I don't know.
Something with my lips?
Sounds good.
Let's try that next time.
When exactly is next time?
Good night.
Yeah, I'm really gonna sleep after that.
It's important to me That you know you are free 'Cause I'd never want to Make you change for me Boy, we're good.
Yeah, really good.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Does it bother anybody else that these women live in Hooterville?
Technically, Petticoat Junction is down the track from Hooterville.
Okay, does it bother anybody else that they live down the track from Hooterville?
It bothers me that they bathe in the town water tank.
With the dog.
It isn't the drinking water.
It is the water for the train.
- It's still three naked women with a dog.
- I want to be the Hooterville dog.
Yoo-hoo!
Coming down.
Now don't mind me.
I'm just putting some clothes in.
Eric, honey I thought you could wear this on your birthday.
It's nice.
You look so handsome in it.
Why would I want to dress nice on my birthday?
It's your birthday?
You never know what's going to happen on your birthday.
Mom, do not throw a party for me.
Listen to Mr. Popularity.
Like I have time to plan you a party.
By the way your sister Laurie's coming home from college for the weekend.
No special reason.
She just is.
You're getting a party.
And best of all, it's a surprise.
I just realized, Donna's older than you.
- Only by a month.
- Good for you, Eric.
- Good for me, what?
- In my country it is good luck to fall in love with an older woman.
- Fez?
- No, they come with livestock.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
- Morning.
- Morning.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Did I just see about seven bags of potato chips in there?
They were on sale.
Please, don't throw me a party.
I'm not throwing a party.
- Don't give him one.
- I'm not.
- He's too old for a surprise party.
- I'm agreeing with you.
- Then stop yelling.
- I'm not yelling.
Look, I know money is tight, so I don't want a big birthday.
I'll decide when money is tight.
Now, what kind of gift do you want?
Don't worry about the cost.
As long as it's reasonable.
Okay.
I would like a cassette player for the car.
A cassette.
Not an eight-track.
No eight-track, okay?
You know, I don't know why they don't just put record players in cars.
The point is, I don't want an eight-track tape player.
- Then you won't get one.
- But, honey, he wants one.
No, I want a tape player, just not an eight-track.
You'll get a Delco.
A genuine GM part for your genuine GM car.
It doesn't have to be a Delco.
It's just for music.
See, now there's your first mistake.
Parts have to be compatible, Eric.
You're not burning cheap gas in that car, are you?
No, sir.
I'm going out.
Good.
I want you to run to the store for me.
Get a large can of frosting and 15 small bags of M&M's.
Plain, not peanuts.
They're for your sister.
That was close.
- So?
- What?
What are you going to get Eric for his birthday?
I don't know.
Nothing seems right.
I want to give him something special.
He kissed you!
Get in the car.
Donna, get in the car so we can talk.
Okay, what happened?
Jackie, I'm not gonna talk to you about this.
Then who are you gonna talk to?
Okay, we get home from the Rundgren Concert and I'm sitting on the hood of the car, and I kissed him.
French or American?
I can't believe I'm talking to you about this.
Guys, no.
Okay, so Look, I've lived next door to Eric my entire life and we talk about everything together.
We love the same music, we love the Packers.
Then I kissed him, and everything changed.
Now I don't know if he's my boyfriend or best friend.
If he's my boyfriend, I'd lose my best friend.
If I screw it up, I lose both.
Now I have to get him this gift and I don't know Donna!
I've solved it.
Get him a scented candle.
A scented candle?
It's practical and romantic.
Yeah.
Hey!
I have the ball last.
I win.
No, you didn't win.
Yes.
I had the ball last and Holy Mother.
Hello, Laurie.
Hello, Kelso.
Hyde.
Who is the goddess?
The goddess is Eric's sister.
She's not a goddess.
She's more the earth mother whore type, which works for me.
- Laurie.
- Eric.
Shouldn't you put some clothes on?
Why?
Aren't you a little cold?
- No, in fact, I'm hot.
- Then why don't you go upstairs?
I am waiting for my jeans to come out of the dryer.
And I want you to stay off my case.
It'll only take me a minute.
I don't think Kelso's gonna last that long.
Too bad.
It's not like I'm completely naked under this.
I'm wearing underwear.
See?
If we were at the beach, you wouldn't even notice me.
If we were at the beach, Kelso would be in the water right now.
So, I understand you have the wagon now.
I want to borrow it tomorrow night.
I need it.
- Okay.
But I need a favor.
- For you?
I don't think so.
Come on.
Look, just tell Mom I'm too old for surprise parties.
But you're the baby, and Mama loves her baby.
If you do it, you can borrow the Vista Cruiser.
- All night.
- All night?
Fine.
Then, it's a deal, baby.
Your sister wants me.
I mean, you saw her coming on to me, right?
Let him go.
Remember?
I said, "Hello, Laurie".
And Laurie said Hello, Kelso.
I'm waiting and I want you.
Baby.
Take me now.
I need it bad.
I need it all night.
And Mama loves her baby.
I'm completely naked under this.
And I'm hot for you, Kelso.
What?
You didn't see it?
Get out of the yard!
So, how's your friend Janice?
Pregnant.
She was such a nice girl.
How does that happen?
First the egg travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus where it attaches to the wall.
Eric, for God's sakes, that's no language for a woman to hear.
It's okay, Red.
I know what a fallopian tube is.
I think Mom does, too.
I just don't like my little boy bandying those words about.
You're still my baby.
Thanks, Mom.
Laurie?
Quit staring at your sister and eat your carrots.
Yeah, Eric wanted me to tell you that he thinks he's too old for a party.
Keys.
There's no party.
Laurie, loose lips.
Laurie, I just remembered: I can't loan you the Vista Cruiser on account of I hate you.
Laurie, you're not driving the Vista Cruiser.
It's old and undependable.
It could break down and you'd be at the mercy of any maniac who came along.
It's okay for Eric, but you're taking the Toyota.
And here's $20.
Will that cover gas?
It should.
Honey, give her another $10, just in case.
You know, I could probably use some gas money.
Yeah, and if a frog had wings, he wouldn't bump his ass when he hops.
Coming.
I'm coming.
Donna?
Donna, it's 3:00 a. m. Are you crazy?
Crazy?
Crazy in love with you.
What is it about you that drives me wild with passion and desire?
I am 17 now.
Shut up, and sit down.
I have to give you your birthday present.
It can't wait any longer.
Close your eyes.
This is my birthday present?
No, that's my nightgown.
I'm your present.
Open your eyes, birthday boy.
Surprise!
Birthday breakfast.
And this is it, young man.
A few gifts tonight, the end.
And it is too late to change your mind about a party now.
So don't think you're getting one or you will be sorely disappointed.
Happy birthday.
You know, the lawn's not gonna cut itself.
Thanks, Mom, Dad.
Hey, little brother.
Nice tent.
Look, I know what you're all doing here.
What are you talking about, Eric?
We're just hanging out.
Like always.
Except we're dressed nice.
But that doesn't mean anything.
Hi, kids.
I need your help with something.
Jackie, Donna, Michael, Steven young man with an accent, could you give me a hand?
Not you, Eric.
God, I can't take it.
But I No.
No, I No.
Eric?
Eric, honey.
Honey, could you come up here for a second?
Shut up.
He's coming.
Surprise!
Wow!
I mean, yeah.
It's an eight-track tape player.
- I see that.
- Just what you asked for.
You made such a big deal about it, I wrote it down.
- Cassettes.
Great.
Thanks, Hyde.
- You're welcome.
Let's put them in the eight-track and play them.
It's a hot-shave dispenser.
He won't need that for a long time.
- A long time.
- Of course he will.
He's almost like a man.
- I got you something.
- No.
Donna, help me find my purse.
Now.
Jackie, you didn't even bring a purse.
You can't give him your present in front of his guy friends.
I am one of his guy friends.
Look, Donna, I have put a lot of thought into this gift.
Please do not wreck this for me.
I'm sorry.
I guess I was being selfish.
It's okay.
Okay, it's time we disappeared.
- What?
Honey, the party just started.
- That's why we're going over to Bob's.
- I wanted to give Eric a party.
- And you did.
You make a mess, you're all grounded.
You darn kids.
You know, what if they run out of ketchup or something.
Let's go.
Okay.
We have more buns and sweet pickles if you don't like the dill.
Okay, I'd love to stay, but I'm leaving.
Buy us some beers?
We'll pay double.
Do you really think that beer will make your little party better?
Yes.
I admit it would give you young people a sense of maturity but it would be a false maturity, and that would be wrong.
- So you're not going to do it?
- Of course not.
Now, I'm going off to join my legal friends at a party with a keg.
Bye.
So, Laurie where's the party?
You know, maybe we'll cruise by later.
In your dreams, you idiot.
Okay, you guys had to see that.
Three fours, I need them.
Bob is very good at Yahtzee.
- The liquor cabinet.
- It's locked.
- What if there's an emergency?
- They'll call.
- What if they run out of chips?
- They'll starve.
I'm gonna fix myself a Tom Collins.
Red?
No, Kitty needs one.
I am just so worried.
- My lord.
Laurie's leaving.
- Honey, she's in college.
She doesn't want to hang around with them.
Maybe I should make a call, just in case Kitty, what could happen?
What could happen?
Plenty could happen.
Plenty.
Now that the adults are gone, we can be as bad as we want.
Who wants to give Eric a venereal disease?
Look.
Coasters.
Forget coasters!
Please, fellas my mom put out coasters for a reason.
I think I'm gonna put my drink directly on the furniture.
That way, it will leave a ring.
No!
Why didn't I beg my mother to stay?
Quiet, you silly American.
I am making a long distance call on your parents'phone.
But that's immoral.
In my country of Wherever it is I am from, I can never tell.
Morals get in the way of a good dirty time.
But first, I need to eat some chips.
What?
Out of chips?
Now I am mad.
I must shoot something.
Not the littlest hobo!
Why?
You're over-reacting.
Kitty, when Valerie went off to school, I felt the same way but this little book of poems helped me.
It's called, "Verses from an empty nest".
Read her that one about the little bird that lost its way.
Yeah.
"The little bird that once did sing "is now alone with broken wing" God.
Yep, that sounds nice.
- I need a refill.
- But, honey, usually you only drink one.
Tonight I'm having two.
- Wait on the porch, and I'll get Eric.
- It's dark out there.
And you're giving him a candle.
Yeah.
- Here, matches.
- He might not want to light it.
Don't say that.
Don't even think it.
Now, when he opens it, he'll say cool or something.
And then you give him a look like this.
- So, what did you get from Donna?
- Nothing, yet.
Maybe it's the big gift.
You know, the really big gift.
You guys know what I'm saying when I say, "the big gift," right?
Yeah, we got it.
And we got it.
I'm not even from here and I got it.
Eric.
Donna's on the porch.
He's getting the big gift!
- A sand candle.
This is very cool.
- It's nothing.
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Yeah.
'Cause you had a look like you might be sick or something.
I am just being completely stupid.
That's my job.
- I was worried about the gift.
- Why?
This is a very cool gift.
- I'd light it if I had matches.
- Here.
You thought of everything.
Happy birthday.
Look at this.
We never thought to put a candle out here.
It is just so romantic.
Let's keep moving.
There's nothing to see out here.
Thanks, Dad.
We have candles in the bedroom, don't we?
This is it.
He's going for it.
- It's his birthday, she should kiss him first.
- She did last time.
- What?
- Nothing.
Shut up and watch.
Come on, Forman, go for it.
The door's open, we can hear you.
We can see you.
Is he kissing her?
None of us can see them, Fez.
Eric, are you kissing her?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Push.
Push.
Come on, you gotta push it.
- How much longer?
- 10 seconds.
You gotta push harder or it's not gonna work.
- This is so stupid.
- It's not stupid.
You're gonna love it.
I'm not gonna love it.
Okay, that's time.
Step away from the door.
Kelso, you're a genius.
Yeah, it's magic.
My God.
Finally.
I am so dehydrated.
Here.
Piggly-Wiggly Diet Creme Soda.
I told you my top three choices were Tab, Fresca, or Diet Rite.
Again, you get Piggly-Wiggly Diet Creme Soda.
- Then I'll just have water.
- You know, there's a hose in the backyard.
I've noticed that the pop selection has really went downhill since your dad got laid off.
He's not laid off, he's just part-time.
And shut up.
Kids.
Kids, kids, kids.
The President is coming.
What President?
The President of these United States, Gerald R. Ford, the 36th Eighth 40th I don't know.
He's the President.
Why would Ford come to Point Place?
Because we are a whistle-stop along his Wisconsin campaign trail.
My dad organized it.
Dear, the next time you know a president is coming to town please give me a little more notice.
I need to vacuum.
Eric, you tidy up this basement.
A pie!
I gotta make a pie!
Wow.
The President's coming.
You know what we should do?
That door thing again!
Yeah!
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So how's the car?
Real good.
By real good, you mean you rotated those tires like I asked you to?
Dad, don't they rotate every time I drive?
- You being a smartmouth?
- Yes, and I'm sorry.
Tuna casserole again?
Well, okay, how about we don't pay the car insurance and we'll all have steak?
All right.
Well, just imagine, President Ford is coming here.
Red, we need to get rid of the oil stains in the driveway.
It's not like he's coming to our house.
And if he did I'd kick him in the keister.
Stop it.
How can you say that?
You voted for Gerald Ford.
Kitty, no one voted for Gerald Ford.
But he still is our President.
The boy's old enough to hear that kind of talk.
Eric, say that your job was sent to a plant in Guatela-who-the-hell-cares.
Now, are you gonna vote for the guy that let that happen?
Red, President Ford didn't take your job.
He took Nixon's.
Eric, we're waiting.
Well I believe that everyone's political opinion is valid and worth hearing.
That's perfect, Eric.
Use that line when you run for Miss America.
Settle down and we'll start the assembly.
Now, concerning the canned goods drive.
Motor oil is not a food.
I'm sorry, it's not.
And all your booing isn't gonna make it one.
Now as you all know President Ford will be visiting our fair city.
And I know there are some of you ne'er-do-wells out there that might be planning some sort of quote unquote, social statement-type protest.
I can't believe this.
Who cares if Ford is coming?
It's better than when the Oscar Mayer Weenie Mobile drove through.
They didn't even stop.
They just slowed down and threw a bunch of hot dog whistles at us.
Two girls in a phallic RV.
Driving around, handing out things you blow.
What a great country.
So let me tell you another thing Mr. or Mrs. Punk.
Protesting accomplishes nothing.
Oh, sure, you might see a chance to prove your manhood or show you're cool but this is our President.
Our President, darn it!
So no shenanigans, you hear me?
And if that's your kind of attitude you might just as well go home right now.
So President Ford should be arriving at noon.
Man, deviled eggs.
Are these for anybody?
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Mr. Pinciotti.
- Hi.
- Hi, kitten.
Now, look, we're talking about adult stuff here.
Why don't you and your friend head up to your room?
Now, the most important part of our presidential rally is the townspeople "Q" and "A" section.
Just so, everyone's clear the "Q" stands for "Question", the "A" for "Answer".
All yours, Jack.
This is where normal folks step up to the microphone and ask the President questions.
Now, the important thing is to choose the right person, you know.
A working class guy.
Your average Joe.
I guess someone you and I would call a loser.
So, of course, I thought of you.
We'd like you to ask President Ford a question.
So what do you say to that?
I say, no, thank you, and I want my crescent wrench back.
I'll do it.
No, you keep working on your pies.
Just imagine, Red, you, the little guy get to have your opinions heard by the most powerful man in America.
Take advantage of this opportunity.
- Turn that light off.
- Sorry.
Look, guys, we gotta do something that says we will not pay homage to a corrupt electoral system.
I know.
A bloody coup.
That's good, but we're looking for something great.
Something that would make our founding fathers proud, man, you know?
- Let's streak!
- Bingo!
Yeah!
I've always wanted to do that just run buck naked through a sea of people.
Be free and shake it around.
All right, who's in?
Will people be chasing us with torches and pointy sticks?
- No.
- Then I am in.
Great.
Eric?
- Are you in?
- Streaking.
I'm Don't get me wrong, I'm completely pro-nudity but I think my dad might kill me, and I'm anti-being killed.
If there wasn't some huge downside to doing something this stupid it wouldn't be worth doing, you know?
Good point.
And I could write some really great slogan like "I hate the fuzz" on my ass.
If you hate the fuzz on your ass, why don't you just shave it off?
Pretty snazzy?
Looking good, Dad.
I got one for you, too.
We're gonna wear them to meet the President.
No.
No way.
Honey, you're missing the big picture.
Let me go get the other jumpsuits.
You'll see.
Mom, why are you doing this?
Honey, there are lots of things I do to make your father happy that I don't really like.
- Mom!
- No, not that.
I love that.
I meant like fishing.
See?
When we stand together, we're the American flag.
- I'm not wearing a striped jumpsuit.
- No, honey, you're the field of blue.
Bye, now.
But, Donna, you're part of the family.
My, this hurts.
- Yello.
- Good news, Bob.
I've been thinking about it and I've decided, I will ask Ford a question.
Red, this is good news.
And I could sure use it right about now.
Yeah, glad I could help.
I'm gonna ask him a question all right.
And it's gonna be a damn good one.
Red.
Now, don't worry.
I'm simply gonna ask him how the hell he's gonna fix this economy.
Honey, he wouldn't know that.
He's the President.
All this food for 45 cents, it is unbelievable.
I see.
So, Forman, the rally's tonight, man.
What's your decision?
- Yeah, are you gonna streak or not?
- Don't pressure him.
No, I've been doing some thinking, and I'm in.
- All right.
- You're gonna look like a bunch of idiots.
A bunch of naked idiots.
Thanks, Kelso.
Look, we must keep this quiet.
It can't go beyond this table.
If my father finds out what we have planned, he will nail me to the wall.
Why are you all sitting on one side of the table?
Okay, now.
Make way for my Presidential pies.
See?
Cherry, mock apple, blueberry.
See that?
Red, white, and blue.
It's like the beginning to Love, American Style in pie.
Look.
Lookit.
See, honey, you're not looking.
Yeah, pie.
Dad.
Mr. Pinciotti wanted me to give you this.
- What is it?
- It's your question for President Ford.
But I'm working on my question for President Ford.
Right.
This is the one the committee made up for you.
"What has been your favorite parade"?
This is asinine.
- Macy's?
- No contest.
Right.
Can I borrow your trench coat?
I can ask the President any damn thing I want.
It's my right.
I'm not gonna be a puppet for Bob's committee.
I'll take real good care of it and I'll bring it back as soon as I possibly can.
Honey, just take the coat and leave.
No.
Eric, a man has to stand up and be heard.
I will not sit quietly by while everything is taken away from me.
They took my job, my stability now they want to take away my right to free speech.
You still have the Toyota, it gets great mileage.
Where is the America that I knew as a boy?
Where?
You tell me, dear God, where?
Okay, I really hate being in this room right now.
Okay, when the President starts his speech here I'll blow my Oscar Mayer whistle and we go.
Did you write, "I hate the fuzz" on your butt?
Yeah.
- Donna, here's your lipstick back.
- Keep it.
- You got the masks?
- Yeah, I got three Snoopys and one Nixon.
Not it.
Damn.
Fez, how'd you know how to do that?
My country invented "not it".
So can we go already?
I'm itching to release the hound here.
It's go time.
Now, look at you guys.
What is it with you young people and Colombo?
Bye.
Bye.
Aren't you going, Donna?
No.
My Dad's gonna make me wear this really queer jumpsuit.
I don't know if I can do it.
It's just too embarrassing.
You know, Donna, my grandmother came from Sweden and she had this thick accent and it embarrassed me to no end.
I asked her not to come to my high school graduation 'cause I didn't want my friends to hear her talk and she didn't come.
Sixteen years later, she got the gout and died.
You see?
No.
All families are embarrassing.
And if they're not embarrassing, then they're dead.
All right, try and blend in.
see you alone like that, so I came over and here you are.
Hey, you hitting on my girlfriend?
Michael, he's not - Hey, man.
You wanna go?
Come on.
- Yeah, let's go, cowboy!
- You are so lucky I'm naked, pal.
- Shut up.
There's supposed to be a blue field of stars there.
Oh, honey.
Now, if we just start to sway back and forth it'll look like the flag is waving in the wind.
Oh, god.
- There's another guy in a trench coat.
- I bet he's a streaker, too.
Fez, he's with Secret Service.
- How about that man?
- Yeah, Secret Service.
- And that man?
- Yeah.
And that man with the dog?
Yeah.
- The dog is looking at us.
Come here, boy.
- No, Fez!
- Man, I just thought of something.
- What?
What are we going to do with our trench coats?
I mean, after we rip them off, we can't come back here and get them.
- Shucks.
- God, this is all my fault.
You know what?
I'll hold the coats.
You guys streak.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
I just thought of something, too.
We're naked, and there's a lot of dogs here.
Maybe we should just sit down.
- I'm in.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
- Okay.
Ladies and gentlemen the President of the United States of America Gerald R. Ford!
What are you doing hiding over Okay.
Back off.
I am a flag.
- Are you gonna streak?
- No, we took a vote and it's unanimous.
We're all very chicken.
That's too bad.
It's been a while since I've seen you naked.
- You've never seen me naked.
- Like a zillion times.
When we were kids, you were always running around the neighborhood naked, screaming, "Wee, wee!
Pee, pee"!
Now it's time for the "Q" and "A" portion of our program.
First up, I'd like to introduce Red Forman.
Red is a father of two wonderful children and how he's managed to keep them clothed and fed while being cut back to halftime at the plant is beyond me.
But he doesn't blame the President for his misfortune.
No, sir.
He only blames himself.
I give you Red Forman!
Mr. President I I Come on, Red.
Your dad is bombing.
Wee, wee!
Pee, pee!
Hey, Gerry, here's my question.
How the hell could you pardon Nixon?
- Hey, son.
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, good job at the rally today.
Not bad.
I kind of stumbled there at the start but I think I nailed him with a good one.
Anyway, it was pretty cool.
Yeah, well sometimes a man's gotta do what he thinks is right.
Yeah, I'm gonna call it a night.
All right, son.
Good night.
Good night, Dad.
And next time, don't wear black socks.
You looked like an ass.
How could they not catch you?
I guess no one wants to tackle a naked guy.
So true.
You didn't see anything, did you?
No.
Well maybe just a bit.
But not the bit.
Wait, what do you mean "bit"?
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
I'm waiting.
Forget it.
Just say it and she'll go home.
Fine.
You're right, Jackie, the Fonz could beat up Bruce Lee.
Thank you.
Now, Michael, call me tonight at 8:00.
- But that's when Chico And The Man is on.
- I know.
But I like it when you describe it to me.
Do your Chico impersonation.
I don't think these guys really want to hear my - Sure we would.
- Go ahead, Michael.
By all means.
Please.
All right.
Looking good!
I love this!
Kelso, quick question: Why can't you date someone a little less annoying?
Like who?
- What about Barbara Vansen?
- She's just as annoying as Jackie.
- Yeah, but her boobs are huge.
- So?
Do you find that annoying?
Pam Macy.
Now she's got some knockers, baby.
True, but they're not bigger than Barbara's.
- Yeah, they are.
- You're dreaming.
It's like comparing Exodus and Deuteronomy both of which have taught us very valuable lessons.
Hi, Dad.
Damn dryer's broken.
Nuts.
I need my vice grips.
Have you seen Pam in a tube top?
It's like you're looking at the Grand Tetons.
In a tube top.
Look, the issue isn't, are Pam's big, right?
The issue is, are they bigger than Barbara's?
Because Barbara's are bigger than the walls of Jericho which, as we all know, came tumbling down, right?
- Hello, Mrs. Forman.
- Hi.
Eric, did your father come down here?
- Yeah, he's fixing the dryer.
- Dear.
You know, ever since the plant cut back his hours he spends all his time fixing things.
Things that don't need fixing.
Things I need.
Things I use.
Things I love.
I gotta go hide the crock pot.
Sounds like your dad's losing it.
If he's like this now, he's gonna be a total headcase if they shut down the plant.
He's going to be this pathetic guy With breasts the size of watermelons!
Is what Moses said to the Egyptians.
Kelso, go home.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Forman has the ball.
He fakes left.
He fakes right.
The crowd is on their feet!
They're chanting: "Forman!
Forman"!
That's game.
- I've got winners.
- No, I've got to go.
It's almost 8:00, and I've got to call Jackie.
Looking good!
Shut up.
Pinciotti has the ball.
Forman guards her closely.
She tries to shake him, but she can't.
Pinciotti actually scores!
Hell freezes over!
- A monkey types Hamlet!
- One nothing.
Losers out.
Pinciotti, the underdog, up by five.
She fakes right.
She fakes left.
She fakes right, then left.
She fakes faking right and fakes left.
Now she's actually - Donna, what are you doing?
- Running out the clock.
There is no clock.
Sucker.
And that's game!
Man, what a slaughter.
I just wiped the court with you, from one end to the other.
I gotta go inside, but I'll leave the light on.
I don't want you to gloat in the dark.
Eric, don't you want your balls back?
Okay, now look, that's a little uncalled for.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Is this table wobbling?
I don't think so.
No, it's definitely wobbling.
Well, honey, anything will wobble if you shake it hard enough.
Give me a hand, Eric.
We'll flip this thing over.
- Honey, we're eating.
- Yeah, let's just put a sugar packet under it.
Sugar packet?
That's what's wrong with this country, Eric.
Nobody wants to roll up their sleeves and work.
They're all looking for their sugar packet solution.
Well, not me.
I'm getting the saw.
Mom, has Dad gone crazy?
I'm afraid so, dear.
Donna beat you in basketball?
Is this true, Eric?
Yeah.
What, is that a big deal?
Of course not.
Unless Donna happens to be, you know, a girl.
Especially a girl you love.
You know, in my country, if a woman beats you it makes her want you.
Really?
Yes, but this is America, wuss.
Wuss, wuss, wuss.
Kelso, would you stop that?
Wuss, wuss, wuss!
Wait.
What about Kelso?
I mean, Jackie has him totally whipped.
Whipped like the family pig.
I am not pig-whipped.
Where do you even get that stuff?
Are you kidding?
Michael, call me at 8:00.
Michael, do your Chico impression.
Michael, rub oil on my thighs while I spank you.
Please, someone else talk now.
I think we got it.
That's lovely, Red.
- Solid as a rock.
- It sure is.
Thank you.
Now Why don't you go watch TV, while I get lunch ready?
Kitty take your hand off of that melon.
You know, you haven't gone fishing Kitty, take your hand off that melon.
Well, I gotta get back to work.
Midge, this table is a little wobbly.
Stick some sugar packets under it, will you?
Hello?
Oh, my God!
Donna, it's for you.
Hello?
You beat Eric at basketball!
How could that happen?
So I beat Eric at basketball.
What's the big deal?
Eric will never be your boyfriend if you keep beating him at stuff.
Okay, it is like in West Side Story.
Now, if Maria beat Tony at one-on-one, they would have never fallen in love.
Yeah, and Tony never would have been killed in that knife fight.
And neither will Eric if you're not careful.
No.
Don't worry about it.
Someone will stab Eric.
Bye.
Honey, I think your annoying friend is right.
- What?
- Certain things change.
Eric and I have been playing games our whole lives.
And sometimes he wins, and sometimes I win.
No, I mean the rules change.
Women have to pretend to be weak and fragile so that men can feel superior.
That's insane.
If women don't learn to stand up for themselves men will always control the world.
Honey.
Men don't control the world.
Shush!
Okay, I'll see you later.
- Honey, could you open this jar for me?
- Sure thing, pudding.
I'm so lucky to have my big, strong grizzly bear around.
First of all: yuck.
Second: things don't even work like that anymore.
That's what the Equal Rights Amendment is for.
That's good, dear.
You stick to your principles.
And 40 years from now you can tell all your cats how you won a basketball game.
Okay, she was going like, "That is so gross"!
And I went like, "It takes one to know one"!
And she was like, "No," and I went, "Yeah".
Man, are you still on the phone?
Come on, let's go.
- I can't.
- The movie starts in five minutes.
Let's go.
I can't.
Wuss.
Jackie, hold on.
Okay, I'll tell her there's an emergency and I gotta go.
She'll buy that, right?
Yeah, except for one thing.
Jackie?
- Don't be her whipped pig.
- Yeah, look she hung up on you.
Let's go.
You call her later, okay?
Yeah, she hung up on me.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Way to be, way to be.
That's right.
- Do you want to play air hockey?
- With you?
I'd love to, but I'm kind of tired and my wrist hurts, and I think I'm coming down with the flu.
It's just as well.
I'm pretty bad at it.
One game isn't going to kill me.
Okay.
You serve first.
Okay.
No way you could stop that!
That was going so fast, you couldn't even see that.
I saw that.
That's game.
That's That's great.
- Are you okay with that?
- Sure.
Bingo.
- Crud.
- No.
Now look.
We'll get rid of these chairs and we will sit on the floor like those nice Japanese people in Flower Drum Song.
I'll have to make new legs for that damn thing.
I'll be in the garage if you need me.
Okay, now, you take your time and you do a good job.
You call me if you need anything.
I mean, if Is it me, or is that refrigerator too loud?
What refrigerator?
Red, there is no noise.
You'll be swell You'll be great Gonna have the whole world on a plate - Hey, nice shot.
- Thanks.
- You want to play?
- I don't know.
Okay, why not?
Look, game's to 21.
I'll take it out first.
Have you been practicing?
Well a little.
- My goodness, what a super shot.
- Donna, what are you doing?
I'm losing to you, you big, strong grizzly bear.
Donna, you're intentionally throwing the game.
- I'm throwing the game?
- Donna!
I didn't want you to feel bad about losing to a girl again.
Thanks, 'cause being pitied is so much better.
God, I can't believe you care about this.
All I did was beat you at a few lousy games.
A few?
No, two.
Try two lousy games.
Not a few.
Two.
And I don't care.
So please leave my property.
As long as you don't care.
God!
Have you been standing there the whole time?
No, I came out to get one of your father's tools.
He's in there working on my refrigerator.
So I gather you and Donna are going through a rough patch.
No, Mom, we're in a school play about two people who hate each other.
Okay, Mr. Smartmouth but when you get older, you are going to realize that it's pretty silly to get upset about losing a game to your girlfriend.
You know what?
I don't want to talk to you about this.
But I will tell you one thing.
Your father and I have played many games over the years and we never kept score and we always had fun.
Now what did I come out here for?
Your father's fixing my refrigerator.
Red, honey, forget the refrigerator.
There's something wrong with the garage door.
Michael.
We need to talk.
And I am over here.
Oh God.
What am I gonna do?
You could, and I know this is a radical suggestion but be a man?
You're right, Hyde.
No more excuses.
She will crush him, yes?
Like the spirit of your Mayan forefathers.
My forefathers were not Mayan.
Like anyone cares.
So, Michael.
So, Jackie.
I didn't mean to make you hang up on me.
I'm sorry.
It will never happen again.
That's okay.
You were obviously under a bad influence.
Yeah.
I'm thirsty.
Michael, get me a pop.
I'm sorry.
I remember saying, be a man, not be a wuss.
I am ashamed to know you.
All right, all those who are getting some, hands up.
Anybody else?
Getting some?
Hyde?
Fez?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
Just shooting some hoops, waiting for an apology.
When you think of one, I'll be glad to hear it.
Okay, look we're both acting like jerks.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.
You know, maybe we shouldn't play basketball anymore.
Or any games, for that matter.
Yeah, maybe.
End of an era?
Hey, remember when we were eight and I beat you at wrestling?
That was fun.
Donna, you sat on my chest and made me eat a clump of dirt.
- All right, screw it.
You want to just play?
- Yeah, I do.
Hey, you're not going to make me eat a clump of dirt again, are you?
We'll see.
Forman has the ball.
He fakes left, he blows by Pinciotti.
Pinciotti leaps on his back!
What do you want?
Give me the ball!
What do you want?
You want it?
You want it?
You want some of this?
Okay, foul?
So now suddenly we're calling every little thing?
- What are you doing?
- Reaching for a clump of dirt.
No.
Don't.
- Must reach clump of dirt.
- Not while I still breathe.
- What?
- Nothing.
Donna!
You gotta go.
- That's my dad.
- Right.
- See you.
- Bye.
Hey, wait.
Who won?
I wasn't keeping score.
Cool.
Me, neither.
That was pretty sad, Eric.
What?
Come on, I'm going to teach you how to play basketball.
We got four hours until your bedtime, and we are gonna drill.
But I thought that Mom needed your help.
I can't hear you, Eric, I'm ironing.
We'll start you off with 100 squat thrusts.
- Dad, we don't even know who won.
- She did.
Now hit it.
One two three four Ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred.
Okay.
Let's play.
So Barbra Streisand became this huge star, right?
But Kris Kristofferson could not take it anymore so he drinks and crashes his car.
Isn't that romantic?
Say, "Yes, it is".
Yes, it is.
I just love romantic movies, don't you?
Yes, I do.
"Yes, I do".
You know what would be a good romantic scene in a movie?
That night we had by the reservoir when we went skinny-dipping.
Remember?
No, describe it to me.
"No, describe it to me".
Michael, you're so bad.
Okay, the water was really cold so when I dove in, you know No, I don't know.
Michael!
- Dad, about this table - Eric.
What about the table?
Just that it is so darn great, Red.
I think I ought to shave down the legs.
No, that would just ruin it, Red.
For God's sakes, I know how to cut the legs off a table.
You're telling me.
What was that?
Nothing, sir.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I just want to hear the guitar solo one more time.
Not again.
Use the headphones.
Good.
Now, wrap the cord around your neck.
Would you guys respect me if I worked in the town dump?
The town dump?
No.
Now, the state dump Why are you looking for a job?
Everything costs money.
Gas, clothes fun.
- Dates.
Dates cost money.
- No, Kelso, that is prostitution.
Dating is prostitution, man.
Only you don't always get what you pay for.
Said the man who's never had a girlfriend.
What, you guys don't remember Esther, the biker chick?
- Whatever happened to her?
- She's dating my uncle.
I'm going home for dinner.
By the way, Mom and Dad are going to the Playboy Club at Lake Geneva this weekend.
Do you guys want souvenirs?
- Ash trays.
- A woman.
Your parents are going to be out of town?
- Really?
- Yeah.
I mean, I'll be babysitting my sister Tina all weekend.
Just me.
Alone.
Watching TV.
I might order a pizza.
I got an idea!
We'll have a party at Donna's.
A toga party!
Michael!
Maybe Donna doesn't want to throw a party.
- Maybe she wants to be alone.
- Yeah, just me, alone.
If someone happens to stop by, that'd be pretty cool.
So we're on.
I'll bring the beer!
Donna, I have never been to an American party.
May I come?
Yeah, I don't care.
So, Eric, are you gonna be there?
- What?
Yeah.
Sounds fun.
- Cool.
Catch you guys later.
Party at Donna's.
You are both so stupid.
Why?
This is a first.
I actually agree with Jackie.
What?
You're saying that I'm stupid?
Donna just put on the full court press, man, and you dropped the ball.
What are you talking about?
All she said was that she'd be alone Saturday night with a pizza.
God, I'm so stupid.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So, Dad, the guys and I are thinking about getting jobs.
No.
You have a job.
It's your job to get good grades, go to college, graduate and leave me.
Kitty, when I was his age, I worked in a slaughterhouse.
It was a good experience.
I learned how to use a hammer.
The new Fatso Burger's hiring people.
Jackie's dad owns it.
I guess I could get a job there.
There is plenty of time later to get a job to grind the joy out of your life.
It's never too early.
But let me tell you something.
Work is not about fun.
It's about work.
It's about seeing how much crap you can take from the boss-man.
And then taking some more.
And remember Hey, look at me.
Only quitters quit.
So, can I work?
We're sure as hell gonna find out now, aren't we?
So, big party Saturday night.
Whoopee.
I can't believe Forman missed all of those signals.
What signals?
Oh, no.
Poor me all alone in my big house.
Just me and my nightie.
If only there was some scrawny little neighbor boy here.
He's not scrawny.
- You know, why am I even talking to you?
- I'm all you got.
Oh, my God.
So everybody knows?
I'm afraid so.
I just wanted to spend some time with him alone and now I can't.
How does that make you feel?
Frustrated.
It's frustrating as hell.
I mean, I really put myself out there.
I see.
And do you have trouble sleeping at night?
Sometimes, yeah, I do.
Do you think you'd sleep better if you had a scrawny little neighbor boy up next to you?
Okay, let's hear it.
- Hello, my name is Eric Forman.
- No.
Not with a loose hand.
Firm.
Not like a fish.
Again.
- Hello, my name - No.
Step into it.
- Stand up straight.
- Straight-up and hold the fish.
- Don't be a smartmouth.
- Right.
No smartmouth.
Hello, my name is Eric Forman.
And?
And Tell them about your junior achievement experience.
They could give a rat's ass about that.
Okay, show them your honorable mention from the science fair.
- Again.
- Right, rat's ass.
Don't slouch.
Wouldn't that fall under the "stand up straight" category?
See?
That's a smartmouth.
You're fired, Mr. Smartmouth.
See?
That's how that works.
First of all, people who work at Fatso Burger are special.
Now, I know you're looking at me and wondering how do I get where Ricky is?
If you work hard, pay attention and use the proper finger-release technique on the slant cup dispenser, you could be me.
Now, let's get started.
Why do you want a career at Fatso Burger?
I just think it will be a wonderful experience.
My girlfriend's dad owns it.
I love the uniforms.
To unionize the workers, man.
Tell me, what do you consider your best quality?
I'm a real people person.
I don't answer stupid questions.
I speak Dutch.
My eyes.
And I guess my butt, too.
Name something about yourself that you consider to be a weakness.
I allow people to boss me around.
I love chocolate.
I'm brutally honest.
Pinhead.
- Where do you see yourself in five years?
- Fatso Burger.
Covered in gold chains.
Rock star.
Or, no, movie star.
No, yeah, rock star.
Prison.
I'd like to thank you all very much for coming in.
Eric, welcome to the Fatso Burger family.
Yeah.
- Daddy.
I'm so sad.
- Why, kitten?
Because Fatso Burger hired Eric instead of Michael.
- I know, kitten.
- Why would they do that, Daddy?
Let me tell you a little story about Doofus and Diligent.
Doofus is friendly but he doesn't follow directions well.
Now, Diligent always does his job by the book.
This is how the book says to do it.
"Wipe left to right".
Looks like a big order just came in.
"Let me help, guys," says Diligent.
"But wait a second.
Where's Doofus"?
What do you know about that?
Let's see what happens here.
"I was in such a hurry to get back to work I almost forgot"!
Thatta boy, Diligent!
"Hey, there, Doofus.
"You're supposed to wash your hands after using the facility".
"No way, Diligent.
That's for squares".
So Michael's a Doofus?
And how.
We expect you to be responsible when we're out of town.
No parties.
And I want you to be nice to your sister.
Don't make Tina eat dirt.
I mean it.
And no boys.
They only want one thing and it's a dirty thing they want.
Enough said.
Looking sharp, Eric.
You gonna be around this weekend?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Make sure no guys are hanging around Donna, capice?
- So, I got a job.
- Yeah?
Yeah, it seems I'm really Fatso Burger material.
And I really wish I hadn't just said that.
No, it sounded cool.
So, are you still coming to the party on Saturday?
I work late on Saturday night, but I mean, if I get off early I could, like, swing by.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I mean, it might be really late so, like, everyone else might be gone.
You know, if I'm still up, I could leave the light on if you want me to.
Yeah.
No, I mean, yeah, that would be great.
'Cause that way, with the light on, I couldn't fall.
Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Sounds good.
- Okay.
- Yeah.
Hey, Donna.
- That light?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
- Okay.
Bye, mom.
Eric, I'm going to the reservoir.
You wanna go?
Nope.
I gotta work.
Eric, I'm meeting everyone at the hub.
You wanna go?
Nope.
I gotta work.
Hey, Eric, I'm going to see a movie.
You wanna go?
Nope.
I gotta work.
Eric, I just got this new bikini, but I think it's too small.
- Could I model it for you?
- Nope.
I gotta work.
How's that mopping coming along?
I'm just happy to be part of the Fatso Burger family.
You dumb ass.
Here, here, my minimum wage friend.
I demand service.
Welcome to Fatso Burger.
How may I serve you?
That is so sad, burger boy.
You know, Jackie, I've been wracking my brain trying to figure out why this guy didn't hire me.
Michael, I am so tired of hearing that.
You still have me.
You know what I think it is?
What?
I'm great looking and he's jealous.
I'm telling you, Jackie, this body is a curse.
Besides, if you worked here you couldn't see me whenever I wanted you to.
Lover.
Yeah.
Please stop touching each other.
It gives me needs.
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Toga!
Hey, man, nice dress.
You brought three beers, meathead?
We'll share.
Here's to our wasted youth Party.
Hey, Fez.
Good evening, Donna.
Which of these ladies are easy?
Donna, some of your creepy friends are using Dad's stereo.
You guys, no one's allowed in the house!
Hello, pretty lady.
Hi!
She's not a pretty lady.
She's my sister and she's 14.
- You know, in my country - It's illegal here.
I see.
Michael, you and I need to talk.
Inside.
Okay.
- I'm miserable.
This party sucks.
- You know what'll make you feel better?
A scrawny little neighbor boy.
Why don't you take off, go see him, I'll watch the kids?
Yeah.
Thanks, Hyde.
You're welcome.
Welcome to Fatso Burger.
How may I serve you?
- Honey, it's me.
- I know.
I have to say that.
Okay.
I was on a break from the hospital so I thought I'd bring you some nice, hot soup.
Oyster crackers.
Thank God.
Something to eat.
- So, how's it going?
- It's great.
- So, how's it going?
- It's terrible.
Yeah.
I'm exhausted, I'm behind on all my homework and I think this polyester uniform is giving me a body rash.
I swept the driveway for you.
Mom, I'm sorry, I forgot.
That's okay.
You know what?
Here, I'll do this.
You sit down and you eat your soup.
You know Eric, if you want to quit, your father and I will completely understand.
- Did Dad tell you that?
- You leave your father to me.
You just worry about you.
Hey, Forman.
Who said you were on break?
- I did.
- And who are you?
- I'm his mother.
- Good enough, then.
Michael, sit.
We need to talk.
Whoa!
Ahoy, Jackie!
Welcome aboard the USS Kelso.
You know, sometimes I'm beginning to think you're a real screw-up.
You see, one day I want a house, and kids, and maybe a chandelier.
And if you can't give me those things, Michael then this is all a big waste of time.
You just You gotta try harder.
Wait, Michael, something feels wet.
"Dear penthouse".
No.
You popped the waterbed!
It must've been my roach clip.
Jackie, maybe they won't notice.
I am in love with a Doofus!
Hey.
Donna!
Welcome to Fatso Burger, how Screw it.
- What are you doing here?
- I was bored.
Really?
You left your own party to come see me?
It's not much of a party without you there.
- You're so queer.
- Shut up.
Eric, the whole reason I told you my parents were going away was so we could hang.
Together.
You know, alone.
Yeah.
I know, it's just So Look, Donna, I'm sorry, okay?
I would love to come over, but this is my job.
And, work isn't fun, you know?
It's work.
And only quitters quit.
As long as you know what's important.
I'll see you around.
What do you know, Kelso?
We're out of beer.
You know what?
Forman's old man's got a fridge in the garage and I know he's got beer in it.
It was his idea.
Remind me to kick your ass.
Hey, Red.
Is Forman around?
He sure as hell is not inside that fridge.
Mr. Pinciotti, you're home.
Good.
Yeah, came back early.
Yeah, missed the kids too much.
What're you doing here?
I was just coming home from work and I noticed that someone left your porch light on.
You can't even see that from your house.
- Good eye.
- Thank you.
You know, Eric, that's what I like about you.
I ask you to look out for Donna and here you are in the middle of the night hanging around the back door doing your job.
You're a good guy, Eric.
I don't care what they say about you.
Gotcha.
Goodnight now.
Okay, I was just gonna Yeah, there you go.
Okay.
Goodnight then.
Goodnight, Eric.
- Dad.
- Eric.
- Dad, I'm quitting my job.
- You're quitting?
Yeah, I'm quitting.
I'm irresponsible, I'm a quitter, and I couldn't kill a cow with a hammer.
- So what do you say to that?
- Everybody quits their first job, Eric.
It's no big deal.
What?
That's it?
I gotta say, Dad, I'm a little disappointed here.
- I mean, it wasn't a man's job anyway.
- Red.
Come on, Kitty, it was a hair-net name-tag, nothing kind of a job.
That's more like it.
It's just as well.
It was cutting into your chores anyway.
You did a half-assed job sweeping the driveway.
I thought he did a wonderful job.
It didn't look wonderful to me.
Okay, then.
Sweep it yourself.
Hey, Forman.
Where's that big Fatso smile?
Ricky, how did you start working at Fatso Burger?
Great story.
I was gonna go to college but they made me Assistant Manager, threw the money at me so I never got to go.
But now I'm my own boss.
That's not true.
I answer to a lot of people.
Okay.
I quit now.
Yeah, I certainly would.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Will this day ever end?
Yesterday did.
But today's Friday.
So, no.
God, it's Destroy and Giveback.
- Yeah, why do they call them that?
- You're about to find out.
Hey, Foreplay.
I believe this is yours.
- You broke his pencil.
That was great!
- And you gave it back.
All right, enough horseplay.
Pipe down.
I said, pipe down!
Now, I've got an announcement before study hall.
Whoever burned their initials in the football field I hope you're happy with yourself, punk.
There will be no football practice today until we've reseeded.
And I've watched that team, I'm not impressed, boy.
Let me tell you, they need all the practice they can get.
On a happier note Eric?
Donna?
Do you need something to do?
Actually, we need to be excused.
Donna and I are taking pictures for the yearbook.
Yeah.
If you say so, Eric.
You wouldn't lie.
Well, I might.
This is great.
Eric Forman skips class.
Yeah, danger is my middle name.
Why are we moving?
Mommy.
What are you guys doing in here?
What are you guys doing in here?
I cut class.
What, was there like a fire drill or something?
No, look, I do bad things.
Look, I've ditched class before.
Is Opie getting angry?
What did I tell you about calling me Opie?
Opie, look out for that keg in the middle of the road!
Wow!
It is a keg.
Of beer.
It must be a sign.
Of beer.
That's it, I'm cutting class every day!
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
How did you find it?
We were driving down the road, man, and there she was.
It was a beer in the headlights.
That is my first American joke.
How often do you find a mysterious keg of free beer?
Only once in a while.
You're right, Forman.
Man, you are absolutely right.
- When God gives you a keg, you've gotta - Kill a virgin.
No.
Throw a party.
Whoa!
Go for it, Eric.
Yeah, we'll throw a party.
Gonna charge $2 a head.
$2 a head.
A keg is equivalent to seven cases, that's 168 beers.
If we each drink three beers a piece - No way, sophomores gonna drink one.
- True.
Yeah, and the freshmen will only drink a half.
So that averages out to 1.5 beers per person which means we can invite 112 people.
That's $224.
Cash.
Which is decent.
Okay, grab some ice out of the deep freeze, I'll grab the tub.
That is one sweet mama.
Yeah.
Hey, gang.
Don't mind me.
Just came down to do an emergency presoak on my nurses' uniform.
You remember Mr. Wilbur, the fireman?
He came in today with a sebaceous cyst which is a pocket of fluid that's kind of like a pusy bath oil bead under your skin.
And you think it's solid, but if you take an instrument and you pierce the core and then you apply pressure with your thumb Hi, snicklefritz, what are you doing with the tub?
The tub.
We were just working on a class project.
We're making a volcano snicklefritz.
Out of ice?
I think it might melt.
You heard her let's move it, gang.
Okay, have fun.
- Guys, we've got to get the keg out of here.
- Where are we having the party?
Beats me.
If you guys need me I'll be with Jackie over at our secret make-out place.
- Secret make-out place.
- It's this vacant house over on Sherman.
I mean, this place is great.
It's totally private.
I mean, you can get away with about anything there.
So, if you guys find a place for that keg, let me know.
I've got an idea!
That's a Sylvania, isn't it, Red?
You didn't buy that in my store, did you?
No, Bob, I, got a good deal on it.
You got me.
You got me, Red.
Yeah.
Well, I am just so excited.
Rich Man, Poor Man.
I missed the first episode.
Here's the irony of the show, Kitty, the rich, safe guy is boring.
It's the poor, rugged one, played by the very talented Nick Nolte who is so exciting.
Super.
Now, who would like a drink?
Let's do daiquiris.
I don't know if we have enough ice.
Eric took a whole tub full.
He took a tub of ice?
The kids are making a volcano.
Right, that's why Donna left with all the plastic cups.
- Plastic cups?
- Sure, plastic volcano cups.
If I didn't know better, I'd say they were having a kegger.
Oh, jeez!
Let's go, Bob.
Rich Man, Poor Man, I love it.
I just hope I don't get too emotional.
So do I. Those kids could be anywhere.
Needle, meet haystack.
Look, they left the house in a wood-paneled ocean liner.
We should be able to find them.
Yep, it's a real asphalt jungle out here.
The sun goes down, the rats come out.
I lost my mailbox last year.
Yeah, you know what it is?
The evil spilling over from Sheboygan.
How many stories do you suppose there are in this naked burg?
Eight, Bob.
There are eight.
Michael, this is our secret make-out place.
I did not swipe the key from my mother's real estate office so that you could have a party.
I know it's like a bonus.
And I'm doing it for you, baby.
Okay.
Empty pool, empty house, full keg.
You sure know how to show a girl a good time.
Yeah, I don't color outside the lines often but when I do, jump back, Loretta.
I don't care when you ate, Fez, get in the pool now.
If I get a cramp, it will be on your head.
Okay.
Hurry up and drink your keg.
Hurry up and drink a keg?
Jackie, will you just mellow out?
I mean, this rules.
We've got a keg, and soon everybody's gonna be here.
- Everybody?
- Everybody who matters.
And for the first time, Jackie, that includes you.
No, get away from me!
You heard her, let's drink beer.
- Me first.
- No way, I spotted it.
No, I saw it, too, I just didn't say anything.
You saw a keg and you didn't say anything?
Back of the line.
All right, how do you get the beer out?
- Through the tap.
- What tap?
No!
Okay, we really need a tap here.
I got my Swiss army knife.
Great, we can whittle the beer out.
All right, look, they sell taps at the liquor store.
Yeah, and who's got the money to buy it?
Why would I bring money to our secret make-out place, Michael?
Okay, I've got my gas money.
No, Eric, we're not going to take your gas money.
It doesn't matter.
By the end of the night, we'll have made over $200.
Yeah.
Michael, how are we gonna make $200?
I don't know.
Who's buying the tap?
You buy, I'll fly.
No, Michael, you are Michael, come back here!
Michael, I'm talking to you.
Michael!
Welcome to the pool.
I am your host, Fez.
$2, please.
What is going on?
I didn't want to tell you before but we've taken it upon ourselves to help your mom show off the house at $2 a head.
He's lying to Jackie, man.
I lie to Jackie.
You know, it seems to me that the scrawny little neighbor boy is willing to engage in criminal acts for that saucy redhead next door.
Shut up.
How do you know he's not doing it to impress his friends?
You know, peer pressure.
Because his friends aren't saucy.
Kelso's saucy.
Kelso?
Please, I'm saucier than Kelso.
Then the door burst open wide And my daddy stepped inside And he kissed my mama's face And he brushed her tears away The night Chicago died Would you turn that damn thing off?
Keep your eyes peeled for that Vista Cruiser.
Okey dokey.
Sorry.
I see you've got some new steins here.
Hi, I'm 25.
I know I look young, but my dad asked me to come down here and pick up a tap for his keg.
And he's 43, so we're both legal.
No problem there.
I'm not going to be drinking the beer or anything.
'Cause I don't believe in it but no offense to you.
- I think selling liquor is a great thing.
- Yeah, here you go.
Yeah.
- Because I'm 25, right?
- Because you've got money.
- Yeah, but I am 25.
- Don't need to be.
Can't drink a tap.
No, I can prove it you.
I got my IDs out in the wallet.
Happens all the time.
Take care.
Yeah, but I Leave, now.
Yeah.
Kelshmo.
Whatcha got there?
Boy, that was really funny what you did with my name, Kelshmo.
I gotta go.
I believe this is yours.
- You broke his thing.
- And you gave it back.
- Yeah, that was great!
- Yeah!
So you see what I'm saying about the poor man?
Yes, you have made your point.
Many times.
He's a bad boy, he's had some rough breaks but he isn't bad in his soul.
Okay.
Enough daiquiris for you.
Kitty, what do you look for in a man?
I'm married.
I'm kind of through looking.
Kitty, you can always look.
It helps you to fantasize.
Like.
Some nights, I'm doing the news with Walter Cronkite.
Okay, I'm just You know, I'm gonna finish your daiquiri.
- It's broken.
- I got duct tape.
Duct tape?
Do you know how much pressure runs through that tap?
I got a whole roll of duct tape.
I can't work like this.
Forman, you need to get your dad's tap now.
My dad doesn't have a tap.
Red's got bicentennial swizzle sticks.
He's got fake lemons with real lemon juice.
He's got toothpicks shaped like swords.
Red Forman is a cocktail dad.
And cocktail dads have beer taps.
Yeah, come on, Eric, we never ask you for anything.
You guys ask me for everything.
So, what's one more thing?
No, forget it.
I've done enough today already.
Count me out.
Hey, Kelshmo, what, your tap is broken?
Why'd you do something stupid like buy a stupid, broken tap?
What are you stupid?
It wasn't broken until you broke it.
Man.
Don't beat yourself up.
You had no way of knowing.
- Anyways, we gave it back.
- Yeah, broken.
Lay off him, all right?
He feels bad enough already.
- He should because he's a moron.
- What did you say?
I said that you're both morons.
What are you going to do?
You're gonna beat me up?
What, you weigh The fact is that the tap is broken and it's your fault.
Morons.
You are so rude.
Give us our $4 back.
Okay.
Fez.
Familiar?
Wow, Eric, you just tore their money.
And gave it back.
That was great.
That was awesome.
But enough of this levity, wench!
We came here to have a party and as God is my witness, there will be a party!
Nope, I haven't sold a keg all day, but a young guy did come in for a tap.
Young guy Look, they got Pina Colada in a can.
- Bob!
We're doing something here.
- All right.
You know, I might have heard something about a party.
Can't recall.
Maybe Andrew Jackson could remind me.
Andrew Jackson?
He's not in.
But Abe Lincoln's hanging out with the Washington twins.
Would they have any knowledge of the festivities?
So, a real wisenheimer, huh?
Well, let's see how smart you are when I snap off your head!
Okay, man.
They said something about a vacant house on Sherman.
I know that place.
It's the vacant house on Sherman.
Good work, Starsky.
Let's roll.
Everybody in the deep end!
My mother is showing the house!
- Now?
- People work.
Okay, quiet down, everybody.
The deck is new and this lovely tile walkway leads directly to the pool Which is filled with some of the local kids.
Heavily Caucasian.
It's a nice neighborhood.
Sometimes Bob pretends he's poor.
I call him Buster.
He knocks on the door, and I answer it in my teddy.
And he says, "Does the rich lady need any help around the house"?
And I say, "I know a something that needs attending to "in the bedroom".
I'll spare you the intimate details but it ends in whoopee.
You know, this is as much fun to make as it is to eat.
You know, speaking of which, how do you get Bob to play those games?
I have a reward system.
You know, sometimes Red would wear a sailor's uniform.
Really?
Yeah, but he was in the Navy.
Kitty.
Does he still have his sailor's uniform?
No.
Just has the hat.
I stole my dad's tap back from those thieves.
- We were worried sick.
- You had us driving all over town.
We missed Rich Man, Poor Man.
- Excuse us, Red.
- What are you doing?
- We're just gonna grab this keg - Get out of here!
- We're not finished with this.
- Neither are we.
Now, you take her home and you wait for me.
That's an order.
Ditto.
Come here.
I can't stay mad at you with that cute face.
Get your ugly butt home.
My dad's gonna kill me.
You're always saying that.
Yeah, this time he's gonna kill me.
I mean, I cut class I trespassed, I had stolen beer and then I swung into a pool full of cops on a garden hose carrying my dad's tap.
Yeah, that was so cool.
Really?
Really.
You looked dangerous.
Did I mention that I killed a guy in algebra?
Good night, killer.
Bring it on, Red.
I love that boy.
- Eric's a good kid.
- And that Donna's real sweet, too.
Man, that Donna's real hot.
- That's my daughter.
- I'm just saying that - I know what you're saying.
- All right, Bob, it's time to go.
- We'll just take the - Get out of here!
All right.
Fine.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
The game is Anaconda.
Big Ace.
Eight ball.
Red Lady.
Jackson.
Fiver.
Wild Man Oh, my God, Michael, they opened up a disco.
- Where at?
- In Kenosha.
You can wear your David Bowie butt-huggers.
Michael, that would be super.
Laugh if you want, man, but my butt looks pretty good in those.
Come on, are you guys crazy?
I mean, a disco?
No way.
I don't know.
It might be kind of fun to go dancing.
- Or we could go.
- I've got nothing.
I fold.
Man, if you're out, go make some popcorn.
Take her with you.
What is disco?
Disco is from hell, okay?
And not the cool part of hell with all the murderers but the lame-ass part where the really bad accountants live.
Excuse me, what are you doing?
- Looking at Kelso's cards.
- That's cheating.
Eric, we can't find the popcorn!
Donna, why don't you take a look at my cards?
Then you won't have to wait for me to leave.
No.
Come on, take a look.
Tell me what I have, you cheater.
- You've got nothing.
- Yeah, but I'm gonna bluff.
So, watch out.
- Donna has stuff for Eric.
Yes?
- Not stuff.
Thing.
Donna has a thing for Eric.
Why do you have a thing for Eric?
He makes me laugh, he doesn't ask me stupid questions - he's smart, and you know.
- No, I don't know.
I know.
It is because Eric is noble, and a woman wants her first lovemaking to be in the arms of a man she can trust.
- Fez.
- Yes?
Go make popcorn.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Dad, I want to talk to you about my curfew on Saturday.
- We're going to a disco in Kenosha.
- Dancing in Kenosha, that's quite a drive.
Can I push my curfew to 2:00?
Or 1:30?
- Or 1:00?
- Done.
So, who's going?
- Donna, I'm sure.
They're practically dating.
- Can I have some gas money?
- Dating?
Since when?
- Mom, we're not dating.
- Why not?
She likes you.
- Thanks, Mom.
About that gas money.
Now, she's interested.
I can tell.
And dancing is the quickest way to a gal's heart.
Remember, Red when we used to go dancing at the Avalon on Mackinaw island?
Mackinaw.
Now, that's quite a drive.
I'll bet the mileage is Volare You see what you did?
You got your mother started.
Volare Man, I can't believe you and Jackie are dragging everybody to the disco.
- It's so sad.
- No, I'm just going to meet Kenosha chicks.
- I'm breaking up with Jackie.
- Get a tall chick.
Because you and Jackie look so silly together.
Okay, that's all the deposit bottles.
And the aluminum cans.
We gotta have at least $1.15 worth of gas.
Come on, my dad's got a ton of empties.
I can't believe they're gonna waste all their money on a stupid disco when they could buy a really big bag Of caramels.
Not going to that disco, huh?
No.
Phony people listening to crappy music does not sound like my kind of time.
You can't dance, can you?
- I can dance.
- I don't think so, pal.
I can dance.
Not one step.
You're right.
Not one step.
Then you got a problem, son 'cause women wanna dance.
They always wanna dance.
Always.
Why?
Because they can get close and wiggle their bodies around in front of a man in a safe atmosphere.
See, I don't really wanna wiggle around in public.
Of course not.
You're a man.
My point is, you're going to have to learn.
Otherwise, later on in life you're gonna be wiggling all by yourself.
Now, if you want I can help you out.
Okay, now, that was good.
Okay, let's try it again.
Okay, now, left, right, left turn, and step.
Okay.
I can't keep up with the music, Mrs. Forman.
Now, let's not get discouraged.
All right.
I am just gonna turn this music off.
Now you follow me.
Okay, you can do this.
Okay.
Left, right, left turn and step.
Okay.
No.
Look at me, not at your feet.
Okay, you know what now, put your arm around me.
A little bit lower.
Put your hand in the small of my back.
Feel how you can guide me?
Yeah.
Okay, left You're leading.
Okay, now, tell me where to move with your hands.
Left, right, left turn, okay, eye contact in the turn.
Okay and dip.
Okay, now, let's just do it again.
Hello?
Anybody home?
I'm bringing back your thermos.
Put your hand there.
That's perfect.
You are better than Red.
I am exhausted.
That is sweaty work.
Mrs. Forman, I would really appreciate it if maybe we didn't tell anybody about what we're doing here.
Mum is the word.
- Tomorrow after school, okay?
- Thanks.
And, Steven, you were good.
Okay, I thought about it, and I'm going to the disco.
Just on the off chance they might mix up a little rock and roll, man.
Yeah, I have something to say.
I went to the mall today and I bought a pair of new shoes.
And they are the coolest kicks in the cave.
So, no more for Kelso.
He's toasted.
I would like some toast if you are making some.
Or food of any kind would be good.
I am starving.
I read somewhere there are these people in India who fast, man.
Yeah.
And their minds are so advanced they can actually think themselves to death, man.
I hope I'm not doing that right now.
My mind's always doing things that I don't even know about.
Man, we always think of so many brilliant things down here but then later, I can't remember any of them.
I mean, they're brilliant, man.
Someone go make toast right now.
We should record our conversation, man.
Yeah, then we could play it back and write it down.
I'll bet that's how the writers at National Lampoon do it.
Yeah, I read somewhere that there are these people in France.
What do they do?
You see, they're incredibly French.
See, that's brilliant, man.
I'm getting a tape recorder.
Where's my toast, you idiots?
- Eric?
- Yeah, Dad?
Listen, I know you need gas money for Saturday night.
If you're willing to do a few extra chores, I'll pay you $10.
- Sure.
I can do that.
- Now I need you to sweep the garage clean the leaves out of the gutters, get the dry cleaning and fix that shelf in the pantry.
Now run that back to me.
Okay, fix the shelf, sweep the garage, pick up the leaves Pick up the dry cleaning.
Yeah.
The gutters?
Fix the gutters.
Clean.
Clean the gutters.
Clean out the gutters, fix the shelf, sweep the leaves.
The garage.
Fix the garage.
Sweep it.
Listen, I'm not gonna pay you $10 for nothing.
Sweep the garage, pick up the cleaning, clean up the gutters fix the shelf.
Do that, and you got yourself gas money.
Didn't you say something about leaves?
- They're in the gutters.
- Right.
Pick them up.
Clean them up.
I've gotta make toast.
Ya!
Oh, jeez, Midge.
Kitty and that boy are at it again.
- You smell great.
What did you do?
- I took a bath.
I was thinking of you the whole time.
You know, I do the same thing in the shower.
- What?
- Nothing.
Okay, let's take some pictures.
I'm ready.
Steven, get in closer.
Okay, let's all smush together.
Okay.
Big smiles.
Nice.
Okay, now, girls.
Look how pretty.
Smile.
Nice.
Now, boys.
So handsome.
Okay, now.
One, two - Mom, why don't I take a picture of you?
- No.
Okay, you'll be late.
Bye now.
You're the best.
You go get them, tiger.
Kitty, I need your advice.
- Sure.
What is it?
- I have this married friend.
And she's about to throw everything away because she's attracted to a much younger man.
- It's Stella.
- No.
I knew that Stella was open for business.
It's not Stella.
- Do I know her?
- Yes.
Very well.
Midge.
Does Bob know?
Yeah.
And he doesn't know what to do.
Kitty, I don't know what to do.
Midge.
Listen.
I think your friend should think about all the people she's gonna hurt and tell this younger man, whoever he is, I don't wanna know that it has to stop.
Thank you.
I just hope my friend takes your advice.
I'm sure your friend will.
Younger man?
Wonder what that's like.
Jackie, where'd you go?
I had to get something for you to bite on 'cause I told everyone you were having a seizure.
- When do they play the disco music?
- This is disco music.
No.
This is samba.
Fez, it's disco, man.
It's crap.
I think I like this crap.
- Come, Jackie, let's get down.
- No, I think I'm a little tired.
Don't resist me, mama.
It's boogie time.
I think you just lost your date.
Yeah, it's cool 'cause Jackie and I are history!
She must not weigh that much.
She touching his ass?
Listen.
Merengue.
Fez, you're crazy.
- They are really good.
- Yeah, if you want to dance that way.
- I would love to dance that way.
- You wanna dance?
Sure.
You dance.
This is a side of you I've never seen.
Yeah.
Actually, you're my first dance.
I'm your first.
I'm honored.
This is nice.
Donna, man, I feel like I wanna kiss you.
You don't have to kiss me back if you don't want.
I'm not kidding.
Shut up and dance.
Fez, you're an amazing dancer.
Actually, Jackie, you are the reason I am amazing.
You see, when a man dances, he should display the woman to the room like a beautiful flower.
Fez.
Michael!
All right, pal, that's it.
- It's you and me, right here, right now.
- Why did you have to interrupt us?
- Jackie is my girl, Fez.
- But you are breaking up with her.
Where do you even get that stuff?
Okay.
I'll be running away now.
Michael!
Michael, it's not his fault.
You just don't know how to dance with me.
I don't know how to dance, so you just take off with some other guy?
I know, Michael.
I'm sorry.
I was wrong.
But all I wanted to be was displayed like a flower.
You know that you are my flower.
That is so beautiful.
Put me down.
Michael.
Okay, I am passing out now.
Okay, Bob, what is it?
Just curious.
- What's the word on that Hyde kid?
- Steven?
He's a little rebellious.
He just needs some direction.
Apparently, he's getting it, Red.
I kind of walked into your living room and he and Kitty were in some sort of provocative embrace.
I think he was putting the moves on your wife.
Oh, my God.
Now I've got to kill him.
Get your deer rifle, Bob.
Hold on, Red.
I could've been mistaken.
You know what you saw.
Get the damn gun.
Maybe she was choking, you know, on some food or something.
I can't take that chance.
What choice do I have as a man?
Come on, Red.
They could've been dancing.
I'm sure she was teaching him dancing 'cause they were all going to that disco.
- Dancing, huh?
- Yeah.
Jeez, Bob that would be downright logical.
Good thing I didn't shoot him.
Hyde, you were right about disco music.
It is evil.
Its pulsing rhythm made me do a bad thing.
Yeah, me, too.
Kelso is my friend.
I cannot take his woman.
You're a good guy, Fez.
Actually, I could take his woman, but I won't.
Come on, I'll walk you home.
See you guys.
- See you.
- Good night.
- Hyde dancing.
What a surprise.
- Yeah, who knew?
Yeah.
You looked like you were having a good time.
Yeah, you know, disco fever.
You catch it.
But I'm better now.
What a weird night.
Did you see Kelso's shoes?
Yeah.
Remember when he saw that girl wearing the same shoes?
Actually, that was pretty sad.
- Yeah.
So - Do you recall that night we crossed the Rio Grande?
What?
I can see it in your eyes.
- What are you talking about?
- How proud you were to fight For freedom in this land Shut up.
Don't.
There was something in the air that night The stars were bright Fernando I'm sorry.
I hate dance music.
Why did you go?
I like you.
So, you're in like with me?
Donna, I'm in I can't dance.
You'll learn.
There was something in the air that night The stars were bright I really want to kiss you again.
Fernando Shut up and dance.
They were shining there for you and me And liberty, Fernando Though I never thought that we could lose There's no regret If I could do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando If I had to do the same again I would, my friend, Fernando I'm saying, the earth is a farm.
That's brilliant.
A farm.
A farm put here by aliens, man.
And we're the cattle.
We're cattle.
And the government knows it.
It's out there, man.
What is?
The truth.
What are you saying?
Out there is the truth.
The truth is out there, man.
That's seriously brilliant.
See, you are all stupid.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Yeah, that's right, Yeah, the wife and I are redoing the front lawn.
And, tell you what, if I'm not there just dump it all on the front porch.
Bye-bye.
Yeah, man, Coach Jefferson is gonna freak.
Yeah, he just shouldn't have given me that "D".
Oh, no.
Dick Tracy is trapped in a giant clam.
Farewell, sweet Dick!
A man being eaten by a giant clam.
Now, I'm not Sigmund Freud, but Eric.
The Omen is playing at the drive-in.
You know what this means for us?
It's make-out city.
I really like you as a friend, Kelso.
Can I bring a girl?
Yeah.
Man, it's gonna be great.
Horror movies turn on chicks faster than porno.
Really?
Faster than that?
Yeah.
If only somebody would make a porno horror movie.
Yeah.
Then there'd be no stopping you.
Eric.
Is that kid from, not America down here?
- Dad, it's Fez.
- Yeah, whatever.
The Erdmans called and they want him to go home.
Kelso, stop saying "porno".
I didn't say it, Mr. Forman.
Fez did.
You are a bitch.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Okay, you know what this is, Red?
Some lady magazine.
- It's Cosmo.
- No.
I'm gonna tell you something, Red.
I just took the "how spontaneous is your relationship"?
quiz.
And you know what?
- What?
- We got three out of ten.
And I cheated.
Gee, I can't help but notice that you're pouting.
No.
I'm not pouting.
That would upset our routine.
God knows, I wouldn't want to move in a new direction and accidentally slip in a puddle of fun or anything.
Okay.
Here's a thought.
How about you and I treat ourselves to a night out?
Just the two of us.
That'd be great, Red.
We'll go to Phillies.
Phillies?
So you'll have the Salisbury steak, and I'll have the baked chicken.
Again.
Maybe I won't have the Salisbury steak.
I enjoy their ham.
Oh, ham.
Okay, then I can change one answer on the quiz.
So, okay, we have four out of ten.
We have moved up from "predictable as the tides" to "humdrum".
I'll just go change.
Damn Cosmo.
Son, when we took you in as an exchange student you became our responsibility.
And we're concerned about this gang of ruffians you hang out with.
They are my friends.
That's exactly what they want you to think.
Now, we're not inflexible.
I mean, we looked the other way when you started wearing cologne.
But now you've brought the devil's music into our home.
No.
That is not the devil's music.
It is Eric's.
Rebecca, show the boy.
Now, listen to what happens when she plays it backwards.
That cannot be good for the record.
There it is!
"Devil love me".
"Devil lives"!
It's clear as day.
What's funny?
In my language, the record just said: "I want to sex your monkey".
Which I have never done.
Donna, I was thinking we should go see a movie tonight.
Cool.
I'd love to see All the President's Men.
Oh.
I actually hear that isn't very good.
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe The Omen.
Isn't that at the drive-in?
Is that at the Yeah, no, I guess it is.
- So, do you want to go?
- Tonight?
Yeah, sure.
When the child was 5 years old something terrible happened.
The truth.
Where does it end?
The Omen?
That's at the drive-in.
I know.
I don't know what to do.
I mean, I really like Eric and I'd like to have a physical relationship, but It's called, "make out," Donna.
Say it.
All right, make out.
But I don't want it to be public.
I don't want it to be tacky, I don't want there to be pressure and now it's this tacky, public pressure make-out thing.
I understand.
Everybody wants their first make-out to be special in some place romantic.
Like Ireland.
Or Disney World.
Disney World?
Right, sorry.
So, let's focus.
He asked you to the drive-in.
Did Donna say yes?
And you said "yes"?
Yes.
Yes!
This is great.
- Me and Jackie will come with you.
- No.
- Will you come with us?
- Why?
- Why not?
- You'd be like competition.
You'd be like a loophole.
- Competition?
- Loophole?
I'd have to keep up with you and Jackie.
That would make me nervous.
I could always talk to you if I get nervous.
'Cause you've got to be bored with sex by now.
What do you mean?
- You and Jackie - You and Kelso have done it a million times.
True.
We have never done it.
Yeah.
Slid into home on the second date.
He got to third base once and that was an accident.
Whatever.
Don't worry, we'll be there.
Fine.
We won't come.
- Perfect.
- Thanks.
Okay, now, see?
This dress says: "Look at me.
Notice me.
Stare at me"!
It's all wrong.
No, you look terrific.
Especially for dinner at the Lion's Head.
No, it's no good.
What?
The Lion's Head?
I thought we were going to Phillies.
I changed my mind.
You never do that.
The Lion's Head.
It is so fancy.
They make the butter look like little flowers.
Yeah.
And it's different.
I mean, hell, we haven't been there in years.
- It'll be fun.
- This is so exciting!
Okay, now, if we are going to go to someplace that fancy I have to shave your neck.
I'll get the clippers, you hop in the tub.
I am telling you, I heard it.
The devil is singing backwards on the record.
It's not the devil, man.
It's Congress.
They passed a secret law to put backward messages in our records, man.
They want to kill rock and roll because they know it makes us horny, man.
Doesn't pretty much everything make us horny?
Cartoons make me horny.
And food.
When you play the record backwards, you can hear the devil speak.
I am starting to hear him everywhere.
Satan is your master, Fez.
Worship Satan.
Before you worship Satan, get him a cherry pop.
Get Satan a cherry pop.
A pop, man.
Get me a pop.
Fez, man, get me a pop.
I'm sorry.
I misunderstood.
Satan's second choice is root beer.
Werner, party of two.
Werner, party of two.
Red?
What is this place?
Excuse me.
- What happened to the Lion's Head?
- Burned down.
Five dead.
Real sad.
Welcome to Blanigan's.
May I take your name?
I'll get back to you.
What do you think?
It certainly is different.
- It might not be so bad.
- On your left, Sparky.
- The staff is certainly enthusiastic.
- I'm sure I can get us a nice, quiet table.
Happy birthday Happy birthday To you I'll put our name on the list.
Forman.
Party of two.
Okey-dokey.
That'll be about two hours.
Here's $20.
All right.
We'll have something in about 15 minutes.
You don't want this place to burn down twice, do you?
- All right.
We have something right now.
- That's what I thought.
Sweetheart, this is our lucky night.
Would you check this?
Sure.
Looks real good.
All right, let's go.
Maybe I should go back to my house and pop some popcorn.
'Cause they always overcharge.
Jackie and Kelso.
What are you guys doing here?
Nothing.
What are you guys doing here?
Donna and I are going to the drive-in.
Remember?
Thank you, Eric, we'd love to go.
Michael, get in the car.
- But I don't think - Get in the car.
Look, this isn't what we talked about at all.
I'm sorry, man.
I'll take it slow.
Try to keep up.
Going to the drive-in.
Hello.
I'm Guy, and I'll be your waiter.
Would either of you like to help yourself to our Blanigan-tastic salad bar?
- What's a salad bar?
- It's right over there.
All the salad fixings.
And you make your own Blanigan-tastic salad.
You mean my wife has to make her own salad?
It'll be worth the trip.
You're kidding, right?
Red.
No, Kitty, it's okay.
Guy, my wife didn't get all dressed up for a special night out so that she could make her own salad.
See, she could do that at home.
For free.
But she wouldn't have eight Blanigan-tastic dressings to choose from at home, would she?
Are you being a wiseacre?
Red, honey.
Your neck vein.
It's poking out.
Sir, I can't bring her a salad.
I'll get in trouble.
What the hell kind of a restaurant is this?
You've got eight people singing Happy Birthday and nobody can bring my wife a damn salad.
Red, honey.
Neck vein, neck vein, neck vein.
Come on, Kitty, let's get out of here.
Happy birthday Screw your freaking birthday!
Please replace the speaker on its rack when you're leaving.
Failure to do so will damage both the speaker and your car.
God, this movie even sounds gross.
That's not the movie.
So You guys okay up here?
No, I want popcorn.
I want Eric and Kelso to go get it.
Eric can go get it.
No, Michael.
Go.
I didn't bring you here to suck Kelso's face off.
I know I'm sorry.
This is so awkward.
You're right.
And I wasn't being a very good friend.
No more making out.
I promise.
All right, about the popcorn I need money.
What?
I don't want popcorn.
Get back in the car.
She doesn't know what she wants.
No.
Michael, no.
We are gonna watch the movie with Eric and Donna.
But I missed the beginning.
The little kid's the devil.
They have to kill him.
Watch the movie.
Look at me, Damien.
It's all for you!
Donna, it's just a movie.
- Do you wanna sit somewhere else?
- So bad.
So.
Here we are.
Back at Phillies.
Yep.
Good old Phillies.
Good food at a fair price.
You're ordering the Salisbury steak, aren't you?
Nope.
I'm going for the ham.
Red, don't put your hat on the counter, it's all greasy.
Pal, can I get some half-and-half?
Isn't this familiar?
Okay, now, here's how we sneak the devil music past Ozzie and Harriet.
Observe.
Alice Cooper, meet Pat Boone.
Don't resist me, Pat Boone.
No, you're hurting me.
- Come on, take it.
- No, it hurts.
- Come on.
- No.
But what if my host parents hear it?
Then Satan commands us to kill them, Fez.
No.
I'll tell you what.
We'll use the headphones.
Yes.
Kitty, I'm sorry about tonight.
It's not your fault, Red.
You know how emotional I get when I read Cosmo.
Boy, do I. You know, okay, at least we gave it a try.
I guess we have slowed down, flattened out.
- At our age, it's inevitable.
- Okay, that's it!
Red!
My lord!
You're not flashing back to Guadalcanal, are you?
Hold on, Kitty.
The night's not over.
You know, the stars are really just Forget it.
What?
Nothing.
So Jackie and Kelso certainly made themselves comfortable.
Yeah.
It's a roomy car.
Yeah, it is.
You know, the bench seat in the Vista Cruiser is the same as what's in the full-size Pontiac Catalina.
That's interesting.
Smooth move, Forman!
Okay, kids, break it up.
Let's go.
You're adults.
Damn right we're adults.
I'm sorry, sir.
My mistake.
That's quite all right, we all make mistakes.
Now, why don't you go bust some pot-smoking teenagers before I give you a good adult-size kick in the ass.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Enjoy your evening.
Red.
That was so sweet.
You let him off with a warning.
Yeah.
- But you're not getting off that easy.
- Red!
Raindrops keep falling on my head Just like a guy whose feet are too big for his head This loud music will not damage my hearing?
No.
It's good for you.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, son.
How was the movie?
- It was pretty gory.
- Yeah?
How'd it end?
I don't remember.
Thatta boy.
So, how was your night?
It was fantastic.
That's great.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, son.
And, be quiet going upstairs.
Your mother is very tired.
- So, Phillies was fun.
- Yes indeedy.
- Very dependable.
- As always.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Laurie's bus isn't here yet.
Can we get in the car and turn on the heat?
I'm freezing.
I'm not wasting gas just so you can be comfortable.
Can we at least go wait inside?
I'm not going in that bus station with those people.
God, I'm freezing.
I forgot to tell you, your sister's bringing a friend home so you'll be sleeping in the basement.
The basement?
They should sleep in Laurie's room.
And Red, I've been thinking.
Maybe this Thanksgiving we should skip the big turkey.
Small ones are on sale at Piggly Wiggly.
This family doesn't scrimp on holidays.
Can you imagine my mother sitting down to a chicken?
Red, your mother won't eat my cooking anyway so that won't be a problem.
Dad, they should sleep in the basement.
Red, last Thanksgiving she said her jaw wasn't strong enough to chew the turkey.
And that was a magnificent turkey.
Dad, it's my room.
- I work myself to the bone for that - All right, that's it!
Hold it.
Now, Kitty, don't get worked up over my mother.
And you, you're sleeping in the basement!
And we're all having a happy damn Thanksgiving!
Mommy, Daddy.
This is Kate.
Hi.
Hi, sweetheart.
Let's get in the car, you must be freezing.
So, you're Eric.
Your sister didn't tell me you were so cute.
We are going to have so much fun this weekend.
You can sleep in my room.
Get Kate settled into your room.
Yeah.
Yeah, and don't forget to show her your GI Joe dolls.
That's such a good idea.
That'll give you a chance to tell Dad about that professor you're dating.
- What?
- Dad, he's joking.
Gosh, I hope it doesn't get too cold tonight.
I sleep practically naked.
So, Kitty, looking forward to Thanksgiving?
Yes.
Red's mother is coming.
What's that pet name she has for you?
Whore.
You know, she doesn't bother me as much as she does Red and he's tense enough, what with Christmas coming up and him only working part-time.
Part-time, that's rough.
When Bob gets tense, we take a bubble bath together.
Soaking my naked body really relaxes him.
Oh, yeah.
- Mom, Grandma's on the phone!
- I gotta go.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So this Kate, is she hot?
Of course she's hot.
All college girls are hot.
I mean, we've all seen the brochures, right?
Okay, Donna.
Help me play some music.
Right now.
- So she's hot.
- Oh, so hot.
Okay.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Donna, how can you be okay?
There's a college woman sleeping in his bed.
He's sleeping in the basement.
Donna, stairs are not gonna stop a high school horndog.
Barbed wire will not stop a high school horndog.
- A wall of fire will not stop a high - Jackie, I get it.
Poor Donna.
So naive.
So what do you guys wanna do?
Eric I hope it doesn't get too cold tonight.
I sleep practically naked.
Naked.
Naked.
Yeah I guess I'm just gonna Just gonna I'm tuckered out so I might as well go home.
So, tell me about school.
I've decided to major in philosophy.
That's good, because they just opened up that big philosophy factory in Green Bay.
- Eric, what did I tell you about being funny?
- I'm not.
That's right.
Now, sweep the garage.
Yes, sir.
I wonder if the Pilgrims were clever enough to put peanut butter on their celery.
Kitty, could you get that?
I'm fixing the drawer.
Oh, dear God.
Your mother has already called me five times this morning.
- You answer it.
- Kitty, I don't want to talk to her.
She gave birth to you.
Hello.
Hi, Ma.
Really?
It's for you.
Hello, Mother Forman.
Just like I told you, I don't know, half an hour ago the kids will be there at noon to pick you up.
Yep, you're right.
I need to work on my attitude.
Bye then.
You know I could have married Bill Bower.
His mother was dead.
What if he yells at me?
He's not gonna yell at you.
You're doing him a favor.
Go.
Red, what a surprise to run into you.
I live here, Bob.
Yep.
Okay, I'm going in.
Actually, Red, I just wanted to ask you a favor.
My appliance store gets real busy over the holidays and I could use a little help down there.
You offering me a job?
Now I don't want you to get the wrong idea.
This is not charity.
- Charity?
- No, not charity.
I'm not looking for work anyway, Bob.
But Goodnight, Bob!
Midge, he yelled at me!
Come in.
Wow.
What?
I was just coming up here to get something to sleep in.
So I guess I'll see you later then.
You can stay and talk a minute, if you want.
Okay.
Close the door.
Okay.
So Kate that's short for Katherine, right?
Yeah.
Have a seat.
So, have you thought about where you want to go to school yet?
I like your school.
I found that it was really I have to go to bed now.
Wait, we are in bed.
Okay, I see.
Okay.
So, good night.
Good night.
Eric.
Just one second?
Baseball, Vietnam, Richard Nixon Pat Nixon, Pat Boone, the girl that does the weather No!
Okay, jelly fish, really big spiders.
Come on, dig deep, okay.
The day we backed over Skipper in the driveway and instead of going to the county fair, I had to bury him in the backyard.
Okay.
I'm good.
And good night.
Good morning, Red.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Yeah.
You're up awful early.
Luckily I heard the phone ring when your mother called at 5:00 this morning.
Yeah, that is lucky.
Before I forget Laurie told me what she wants for Christmas.
A portable TV for her dorm room.
I'm working part-time, she wants a TV.
Great.
Maybe Bob can get you a good deal on one from his store.
I don't need any help from that damn Bob.
You know what he did yesterday?
- He offered me a job.
- He did?
We have to move away from such an evil man.
You're a lot of fun in the morning.
Hey, turkey boy.
Wanna show me your giblets?
So you made out with a college girl?
Kind of.
Start talking.
Tell it like a story, like a sexy story.
Okay.
She, like, jammed her entire tongue into my mouth.
And you wouldn't think a girl had, like, that much tongue, you know?
That's great.
Yeah.
What?
I don't know, I feel kind of guilty.
Almost like dirty.
Dirty is good.
I like feeling dirty.
No, I mean, I feel bad.
Look, I think I gotta tell Donna.
Really?
On behalf of men everywhere.
Yeah, man, I mean the right thing to do is juggle them both until it all blows up in your face.
Look, you guys don't understand.
I can't hide anything.
The minute she looks at me she's gonna know.
What are you guys talking about?
I kissed a girl.
Shocking!
I am appalled!
You what?
You know that friend my sister brought home from college?
- The slutty one.
- Yeah.
I kissed her.
- Why are you telling me this?
- I feel guilty because it was like really kissing.
So what we do isn't really kissing?
I thought you should know, considering that you and I have a thing.
Right?
Obviously we don't have a thing if you're running around kissing slutty girls, right?
Okay, you're mad.
Mad?
No.
Why should I be mad?
I mean, in fact, you can kiss whatever you want.
Start with your own butt!
Why are you here?
Why are you always here?
It's Thanksgiving.
Don't you have families?
Donna, you wanna talk?
- I guess Donna didn't take it very well.
- Take what well?
Eric made out with Kate.
Anything else?
Your son is a whore.
Eric Donna just came through here looking very upset.
Would you have any idea what that's about?
I have no idea.
She seemed fine when we - You already know, don't you?
- Of course I know.
Donna is such a sweet kid.
How could you do this to her?
I don't know.
You know, it seems like bad things are always happening to me like I have bad luck or something.
Son, you don't have bad luck.
The reason that bad things happen to you is because you're a dumbass.
Now fix it.
Look, Donna can we talk?
- I'll leave you two - No.
You should stay.
We don't have secrets in our house.
We don't sneak around on each other like a little horny rat kissing other girls.
Look, Donna please come to my house for Thanksgiving dessert.
Everyone's gonna be there.
You always come.
Please don't let some stupid thing that I did wreck that.
I can't depend on you so why should you be able to depend on me?
Look Donna, please, okay?
I'm really sorry.
- And I feel really bad.
- Good!
- Poor thing.
- Mom!
You.
Of course I meant you.
As a food editor, I wanted to find out for myself just what makes the modern turkey so good.
Amen.
Let's eat.
Now, is everything on the table?
I still feel like I forgot something.
My God, I forgot your mother.
No!
Hello, Mother Forman.
No, I didn't forget you.
I don't know, the kids left a half hour ago to pick you up.
I can't imagine what's keeping them.
Put that back.
Hi.
The Toyota is blocking the car, I need the keys.
Could you hold on one teeny tiny second?
For the love of God, move!
Are you sure they're not there?
Look out your window.
Now do you have your glasses on?
Where's your grandma?
She's not coming.
She said she's going to Cousin Joel's for Thanksgiving.
That's not so bad.
Actually, she said it was a shame she couldn't spend what might be her last Thanksgiving with her family.
But she does hope we all enjoy ourselves.
You know what?
That's just fine.
I don't need to kiss some old lady's A-S-S on my holiday.
You heard what I spelled.
Forget it.
So you give an employees' discount down there at your store?
Twenty percent.
Does that cover, anything like, say portable TVs?
Heck, yeah.
Congratulations, Bob, you just hired me.
Good.
I'm glad to hear it, Red.
You know, you'll have to call me Mr. Pinciotti at work.
I got you good that time.
Donna, I am so glad you came.
I only came because my mom made me, okay?
Donna, all right, good to see you.
I got you some pie.
I don't want any stupid pie.
What?
I didn't kiss her.
Hey, there, Bob.
You wanna piece of pie?
Yeah.
Hey, Donna.
- Don't get all tough with me!
- Yeah?
Yeah!
Okay.
- No.
Look, we need to talk.
- I'll start.
Get out!
What do you want me to say?
I already apologized.
You just want to forget about us because I kissed some girl?
Why'd you do it?
I have it on pretty good authority that I'm a dumbass.
So you liked it?
Yeah, I liked it.
"No" would have been a better answer.
Donna look that kiss was great and if I could take it back, I would.
Because it's not worth ruining what you and I have.
Eric, you are a dumbass.
So is that like "I forgive you, dumb ass" or "Get out of my house, you dumb ass"?
Mostly the first one.
Wow.
Tongue.
Yeah.
Okay, let's go to dessert.
Just one second?
Donna?
Just one minute.
Silk sheets.
Joe Namath's butt.
Strawberries.
Slow dancing.
The washing machine with an unbalanced load.
I'm good.
You haven't told anybody else about last night, have you?
I mean, it's kind of embarrassing.
I mean for me.
Not you.
No, Kate, that's our little secret.
So, Kate, you and Eric?
Like The Graduate, older woman, younger man.
You know, if breaking up couples is your thing you can do your thing with me 'cause Michael!
Hello, Kate.
May I see your giant tongue?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Damn!
Kelso misses another one.
I believe that's H-O-R.
You are a whore.
No, the game is Horse.
Okay.
You know what, Michael?
I'm gonna go home.
I'm gonna do my homework.
You do your homework on a Saturday night?
Yeah.
Look, I mean, look at me.
I've got a 1,000-word term paper due Monday but you don't see me sweating.
- I've got a whole crappy Sunday to do it.
- Jackie, don't go home.
I mean, Steve Martin's hosting Saturday Night.
I hate that show, okay?
They have commercials that you think are real but they're not real.
And then you wanna buy the stuff.
Okay.
See you, Michael.
Bye!
Bye-bye!
Shut up.
Kelso, Jackie does her homework on Saturday night.
That's so hip.
You guys don't have to worry about Jackie anymore 'cause I'm breaking up with her.
We are so tired of hearing you say that.
No.
I am.
I'm breaking up with her.
Yeah, when?
I'm picking my moment.
Where's Fez?
Make that shot, whore.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah.
Hello, Wisconsin!
Now, aren't the waffles extra delicious this wonderful morning?
Did you quit smoking again?
And why do you ask, little one?
You're talking like Snow White, so I figured Eric!
Which is great, I really want you to quit.
I should've quit a long time ago.
I'm a nurse.
I know better.
More sausage?
I'll get it.
Hello?
That's too bad.
Sure.
Be glad to.
Yeah.
See you soon.
Goodbye.
- Who was that, dear?
- My mother.
Seems like Uncle Paul broke his ankle and she's going to church with us today.
No, she's not.
- It's Paul's turn to take her.
- Like I said, he broke his ankle.
Broken ankle, whatever.
It's his turn.
- Kitty, the man is injured.
- Okay.
That is just great.
I will just take a chicken out of the freezer because queen Bernice doesn't like ham.
Okay, look, I'll just call her and tell her we can't make it.
Red.
You know who'll get blamed for that.
Why should she blame you?
She's my mother.
Something she never lets me forget.
Look, you could tell her I'm sick or something.
Eric, go upstairs and put on that shirt your grandmother gave you.
Eric, just stay there.
Your mother is just being ridiculous.
You know what's ridiculous, is giving your mother our phone number.
- What's being ridiculous is - Hold it.
Hold it.
Now, look let's just stay calm.
Mom, if it'll help you out, I'll hang out with Grandma so she'll leave you alone.
What do you say?
First of all, Eric, I'm the one who says "hold it".
When you pay the bills, you get to say "hold it".
Now get in the car, 'cause we're going to church and we're gonna have a damn nice Sunday.
You're damn right.
Just try and stop me.
Damn.
Here she comes.
God, Red, I don't think I can do this.
- Kitty, do us all a favor and light up.
- I'm fine.
Careful, Grandma.
It's just my dress.
It's nice to see you, Bernice.
I hate this car.
You know, I just hate this car.
Your brother Jerry has a beautiful car.
A Lincoln.
But then, he makes more money, a lot more money than you do.
All righty, then.
So, Kitty, Eric tells me that you quit smoking.
Yes, I did quit.
And I just I feel great.
Good for you, dear.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Please stand for a moment of silent meditation.
Dear God.
Thank you so much for helping me quit such a filthy, disgusting soothing, delicious habit.
God, I can't do this.
No, I'm fine.
Amen.
Dear God what's with all the Polacks?
Dear God.
I don't mean to bother you on your day off but I promised to help out with Grandma and I have a term paper due tomorrow.
If you could either get her to leave early today or burn down the school tomorrow.
I mean, either or, God's choice.
It'd really help me out, man.
God.
Lord.
Amen.
Dear Lord.
Would it kill you to give the Packers a winning season?
Amen.
And watch over my loving family blah, blah, blah.
Welcome to Worship for Shutins.
Change it.
All right, change that.
- How did we change channels before Fez?
- I don't think we did.
- You guys, I gotta work on my term paper.
- Where's Grandma?
She's in the bathroom, so I've got, like, - What's the assignment?
- All right.
"In 1,000 words describe the three branches "of the United States government and their functions".
I'll never make it.
Go up and tell them you have homework to do.
No, I wanna keep peace in the family.
Yeah, Donna, Forman wants the Hallmark card family.
- The what?
- You know, Grandma comes over.
To my mother-in-law on this beautiful Sunday.
Your smiling face your kind embrace has made my home a happy place.
And I'm so happy you're the one to whom I gave my loving son.
And I'm so happy you're both happy 'cause otherwise life would be crappy.
I don't want that.
Yeah, you do.
I can see it in those wide, hopeful eyes.
But the reality is this: To my daughter-in-law, you took my son.
You wrecked my life.
You stole my youth.
You hate my wife.
I do my best.
Now, that's a joke.
I'm going out.
I need a smoke.
Damn it, Eric!
Quit hiding from your grandmother.
She's old, she could die.
Now, move it!
I thought she was in the bathroom.
False alarm.
Look, go take care of your grandmother.
We can do this.
Thanks.
- All right, how many words does he have?
- His name, the date, the class.
Seven.
- He's screwed.
- Use his middle name.
See?
Now, this would never happen to me.
That is why I do my homework on Saturday.
This is a moment, Kelso.
Pick it.
I think you all could learn something from me right now.
Moment number two.
All right.
Jackie, we need to talk.
You know what?
I did the same paper last year in history.
I think I got an "A".
You want me to go home and get it?
- Let me think.
Yeah!
- Hold on, Donna.
Jackie, we need to talk about this whole Jackie, why don't you go ahead?
Okay.
Do not break up with her yet, you understand me?
Say you understand me.
All this time I thought you didn't like Jackie.
Just don't break up with her yet.
Okay.
What do I need Jackie for, man?
I know more about this stuff than she does.
The three true branches of the government are military, corporate, and Hollywood.
I need a pencil.
I got it.
Jackie, run!
Love!
I hope you're hungry.
Yup, the chicken will be done soon.
I can't eat chicken.
You know I have an irritable bowel.
You should have made a ham.
Boy, Grandma that was a great service this morning.
Don't you think?
I think the pastor talked too much about forgiveness.
Some people shouldn't be forgiven.
This is why theology is such a rich You know, Bernice, some people don't need forgiveness they just need a little understanding.
Too true.
Have you seen Godspell?
You know, what I don't understand is how in hell a brilliant young man, like my Red could have thrown away everything.
Grandma!
Why don't we go into the living room and I'll rub your feet.
What a wonderful boy.
Look at how thin you are.
Is your mother feeding you enough?
You should come and live with me.
No.
I was just on my way to the garage.
To fix this.
Dad, just watch your game.
No, it's just the Packers.
- Eric, where've you been hiding?
- I've been doing some homework.
That's important.
Yeah.
You know, actually, it's a really interesting Eric, a little less talk and a little more rubbing.
You're the only one who's not afraid of my bunion.
Oh, dear.
Good-bye, Eric, I am going home now.
No, wait, Fez, you haven't met Grandma.
Hello, Grandma.
In my village, we worship feet.
And these dogs are a holy treasure.
- You wanna rub them?
- May I?
Knock yourself out.
Hey, Dad.
Damn it, Eric!
Don't sneak up on a person like that when they're doing this.
How's it going in there?
- I rubbed her feet.
- Now, you're a brave one.
Better get back in there.
Dad, you coming back inside?
Eric I love your grandmother very, very much.
I just can't talk to her or spend any time with her.
Did I mention that I'm in there rubbing her feet?
You know, son sometimes you've just gotta play through the pain.
What?
- I don't know.
Just get back in there.
- Yeah, right.
"With their sugar-coated ideals "designed to anesthetize the ignorant masses.
"Why?
So that the military slash corporate branches "can carry out world domination".
All right, read that back to me.
Okay.
- You didn't get that?
- All right, let's just use the encyclopedia.
You just want to vomit up facts from an encyclopedia?
- Yes.
- Okay, fine.
You know what?
Vomit away.
I will not be a part of this, then.
Eric, are you down here?
He's not down here, Mrs. Forman.
Donna, good, why don't you come up and eat with us?
I need all the help I can get.
Not you, Steven.
Grandma doesn't like you.
Lucky bastard.
What am I supposed to eat?
You know, help yourself to the deep freeze.
But everything's frozen.
And I have a dryer.
Honey, these cheesy potatoes are delicious.
Thank you, honey.
They really are great, Mrs. Forman.
We have them whenever Grandma comes over 'cause mom knows how much she loves them.
Right, Grandma?
They make me sick.
I'm allergic to dairy.
How sad.
Ma, this is Wisconsin.
You're not allergic to dairy.
Maybe she's just allergic to my dairy.
If you're allergic to dairy you shouldn't put cream in your coffee.
- I mean, cream is dairy.
- Donna, just, no, okay?
You shut up, Eric!
Who the hell are you?
Grandma, that's Donna, you've known her for 16 years.
I have not.
Anyway, I like your new friend better.
The feeling is mutual.
Done.
I heard a noise in the garage.
Raccoons.
Bye.
I couldn't eat another bite.
I've had enough.
I'm going back downstairs.
Excuse me.
So, what say we watch Lawrence Welk, Grandma?
No, I'm going to watch Lawrence Welk with my new friend.
You up for another foot rub, Desi?
Fry time.
- Hot!
Hot!
- What are you doing?
Just working on your report here, and having some fries.
Wait, you put French fries in my mom's dryer?
Yeah, the fish sticks are too flaky, so I just I don't even need to Finally.
Where have you guys been?
We had to look for the paper, and eat and then some stuff happened, you know.
- Your shirt's on inside out.
- Yeah, that's the stuff.
- Where's the paper?
- Right.
Okay, see?
It wasn't on the three branches of the government it was on the four food groups.
Okay, look, my dad's got the World Books.
I'll just run next door and get "G".
I'll go with you.
You can break up with her now.
You know, I'm tired of everybody trying to tear me and Jackie apart.
Moron, every day you say you're breaking up with her.
You guys don't know her like I do.
I mean, it's not just about fooling around.
She buys me stuff.
She hoovered your chest, man.
You know what?
I don't care anymore.
All I wanted was a little help with my paper and you've done nothing!
We put your middle name in.
Jean-Claude?
That's two words.
You guys suck.
Just thank God for Donna.
Okay, bad news, my mom sold some out at the garage sale.
But we have "B," "X," and "R".
All right.
Now, you listen up.
I have had an extremely stressful day.
And I am not proud of what I'm about to say but someone give me a cigarette!
Now!
But, Mom, we don't smoke.
Cut the crap, Eric.
I am a nurse.
I know that one in five teenagers smoke.
One, two, three, four, five.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes, and when I open them there had better be a cigarette between these two fingers.
Come on, people.
Hop to!
Thank you.
Light?
Kitty.
There you are, Red.
Ma says the cat bit her, so I'm down here looking for it.
Dad, we don't have a cat.
That's what I thought.
You know, we really We shouldn't leave your poor little foreign friend up there alone with Grandma.
It's really kind of nice down here.
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
- You are so very welcome.
- I hope I wasn't any bother.
Ma, you're no bother.
You're as welcome as flowers in May.
Bernice, here, I wrapped up some chicken for you to take home.
Thank you, dear.
And I hope you put some of those cheesy potatoes in there.
You know how much I love them.
What?
I thought you made such a big deal about how you were allergic to Eric!
This has been a perfectly nice Sunday.
Let's not spoil it.
Sweetheart I hope I didn't make too big a deal about my allergy.
No, Ma, he's a kid.
He overreacts.
You know, this is the cutest little car.
I just love it.
Eight hundred and twenty-five, eight hundred and twenty-six Eric, what are you doing?
It's 1:00 in the morning.
I'm just finishing up some homework.
What are you doing down here?
Snow White came down to gun a stick.
Look, Mom, I wish you wouldn't smoke.
I know.
This is my last one.
I promise.
By the way thanks for your help with your grandma today.
Can I ask you a question?
What does she have against you, Mom?
Well About 25 years ago, your father was dating this very attractive, well-to-do woman that your grandma liked and he married me instead.
And she never forgave me.
That bitch.
Now, who was the lady with the cotton-candy dress?
That's Norma Zimmer, the champagne lady.
She is very talented.
And you see those two dancing?
That's Bobby and Sissy.
I like his tight pants, but she's a slut.
You know, I have seen this show before.
But the band leader's voice was much more masculine.
Bubbles!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
All right, this is basically all you need to know about Bohr's theory of atomic structure.
Cool, man.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Listen, you don't mind me being your chemistry lab partner?
No.
Why would I mind?
Just 'cause I, you know, I tend to blow things up.
Whoa.
Buddy, what are you doing?
- Unlocking my car.
- No way.
This is your car?
- So, you're the guy I hate.
- Yeah, that would be me.
- Can I just - Yeah, man.
I'm so glad you're my lab partner.
I could take you for a ride if you want.
No way.
Let's go!
Hey, don't do that.
I'm kidding.
Here you go, Red.
Your very first paycheck.
Thanks, Bob.
You know, I really appreciate the job.
Yeah, I just wish you had a commission check in there.
Well, I haven't sold a damn thing.
Yet.
But if I paid people for almost selling something you'd be rich.
But I don't.
So you're not.
But, hey, today is your day.
Hi.
May I help you?
Yes.
I'd like to buy a refrigerator.
What kind of refrigerator would you like?
I don't know.
Okay.
What kind of features are you looking for?
I'd like it to be cold.
Yeah.
How many cubic feet of food does your family consume in a week?
Gee, I don't know.
- I do know I like Harvest Gold.
- See, now there's your first mistake.
Now, color is the last thing that you want to consider.
You see, I can't sell you something if you don't know what you really want.
Yes.
It was wrong of me to walk in here, ready to write a check.
But thanks.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Hey!
Where the hell is Forman, man?
This isn't like him.
I'm really starting to get worried.
What if something happened to him?
Nothing happened to him.
What if he's lost or hurt somewhere?
Calm down, Lassie, I'm sure Timmy's just fine.
Maybe we should check the school morgue.
Kelso, the school doesn't have a morgue.
Then what do we pay all those taxes for?
You know what kills me?
You do better in school than I do.
- I'm worried, man.
- Okay, fine.
Let's just be logical, right?
Forman's not gonna just ditch us.
The Cruiser's battery is probably dead or something.
You know what?
It's starting to get late.
Maybe we should just start walking?
No.
I'm not walking.
If God wanted us to walk, he wouldn't have given us Forman.
Oh, my God.
That's Buddy Morgan.
Man, I had such a crush on him in seventh grade.
He is driving the fiery chariot of the sun god.
He's with Eric?
This is a serious clique breach.
A serious clique breach?
That's the worst kind.
You see, Buddy is in the rich kid clique.
They mingle with the jock clique.
Then you have your smokers and your heads.
Okay?
Rich kids can be smokers, and jocks can be heads but jocks cannot be smokers, unless they're rich.
What about Larry Mosely?
He's a rich, jock, smoker, head.
Okay, now you're just being difficult.
Hey, guys.
Buddy, you know everyone.
Right?
Hi.
No, I don't think we've actually met.
No, I am Fez.
Hi.
My gosh, Buddy, with a car like that, you must be knee deep in whores.
Okay, let's head back to my house.
Now, Red, you know working as a salesman is different from working at a plant.
You need time to adjust.
You need to use your people skills.
Kitty, I don't have any people skills.
Okay, come on, now.
Come on.
Buck up.
You can do this.
All you have to do is smile.
That is the most important people skill of all.
So come on.
Let me see it.
Come on.
Okay, you just keep on smiling.
They're finally getting off the island.
No, Fez, they're not getting off the island.
But they have a coconut radio.
What could go wrong?
Oh, Jilligan.
There you guys are.
Where have you been?
Where have we Where have you been?
We've been worried sick about you.
We had to walk all the way here, man.
My feet are killing me.
Are your fingers broken?
You can't use a phone?
Do you know it's freezing outside?
And I'm wearing my uncle's boots, so now I've a blister.
Shaggy, Scooby, we've got company.
Buddy Morgan.
Yeah, I know you.
Yeah, I guess it's my fault.
I gave Eric a ride home.
- So - Get out of my chair!
Okay.
I really have to be going anyway.
So your car is still at school?
Yeah, you're damn right it is.
- I could drop you off if you want.
- Yeah, sure.
Guys, I'm real sorry I forgot about you.
Did you want to drive?
Hell, yeah!
I call backseat.
Did you see that?
He just ditched us again.
Do you even know how difficult it is to clique jump?
Eric has achieved something very special, and you're both ruining it for him.
Who cares?
I'm tired and I never want to walk anywhere again.
Michael, walk me home.
Okay.
Okay, what's your problem with Buddy?
I mean, he seems nice enough.
Screw him, man.
I mean, he's got the money, the car, the family.
The teachers like him, the counselors like him.
Everybody likes him.
I hate him.
Hyde, don't you think you're overreacting just a little bit?
Donna, let me tell you something, okay?
When high school's over, Buddy Morgan's going to a great college.
You know where I'm gonna be?
Sitting right here in my uncle's boots.
At least you've got great friends.
And I'll always be your friend.
Thanks, Donna.
That was sympathy, Hyde.
Not an opening for you to put your hand on my knee.
Sorry.
Move your hand.
Now, ma'am, I'm a friendly guy and I want to help you.
But if you don't know how many amps you need there's nothing I can do for you.
Think, lady.
Wait.
Bob!
Hi, there, I'm Bargain Bob.
I see you're looking at blenders.
Now this one here, all wrong for you.
I'd say it's between these two but this one, visualize yourself blending with this one.
Oh, yeah.
Okay!
Just take that over to our cashier and have a beautiful day.
- Number 10, your order is ready.
- Yeah, I'll be right there.
Number 10.
I have limited counter space.
Please remove your hot dog.
All right.
I don't see why you can't just serve us our food, Frank.
We are paying customers, you know.
I did not lose a leg in Vietnam, so that I could serve hot dogs to teenagers.
You've both your legs, Frank.
Like I said, I did not lose a leg in Vietnam.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, man, where's Forman?
I don't know.
He's not with me.
That damn Buddy again.
You know he only hangs out with Buddy 'cause he's got a Trans Am.
So, you guys only hang out with Eric 'cause of the Vista Cruiser and the basement.
We've been friends with Forman since he was a kid, man.
- Way before he had any of that stuff.
- That's right.
Remember when he used to have that tree house and the go-kart?
Hey, you.
Buy something or get out.
I've got a big wedding coming in.
Frank, you don't have a big wedding coming in.
Did I say wedding?
Because I meant to say, "buy something or get out".
Fine.
I'll go some place else, then.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not going anywhere.
I just bought a hot dog.
I'm outta here.
Hello, welcome to the Hub.
May I help you?
That was a great movie.
Yeah.
I mean, who would have thought working at a car wash could be so much fun?
- So what do you wanna do now?
- I don't know.
Oh, God!
What?
Nothing.
I forgot to call Donna.
Donna.
- So she's like your girlfriend?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
You know, it's okay to be confused, Eric.
Yeah, you know, sometimes I feel like I don't know, like we're in a movie, right?
And I'm nervous around her and I feel like I'm playing this part, right?
But it's not me.
Whoa!
What?
You're gay!
Me?
No, I'm not gay.
You're not?
But you just kissed me.
Okay, I'm gay.
Can you take me home now?
And just because Johnny's a boy don't think that appearance and physique aren't important to him, too.
Johnny and Janey both need reassurance that they are accepted and respected for what they are.
- Look, I'm not gay.
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?
- Yes!
- 'Cause I just thought that - Why would you think that?
'Cause we've been spending so much time together.
Because we're friends.
I've been friends with Hyde for years, and I've never put the moves on him.
Who could blame you?
That guy's such a jerk.
Yeah, but that's not the reason.
It's because I'm not gay.
Right.
- I'm sorry for kissing you.
- That's okay.
I mean, it's Let's just forget about it.
- Do you wanna listen to the radio?
- Look, I told you I wasn't gay.
I'm dead weight.
I'm quitting, Kitty.
Now, you can't quit.
Why not?
Because if things keep going like this, Bob's going to fire you.
It's a joke, Red.
I know!
Let's do some role-playing.
What?
Some role-playing.
I'll be the interested customer and you be the helpful salesman.
Does this end up in the bedroom?
We'll see.
Okay, here we go.
My, that's a lovely blender.
This is stupid.
Red.
It's got stainless steel rotor blades so it can crush ice which is why I keep it out here at the bar.
And it has the highest wattage that you can get without moving up to the industrial model which would cost you twice as much.
Now, see, we have had this blender all these years and I never knew that's why we bought it.
You didn't know that?
How could you not know that?
Red, everybody doesn't research every product before they buy it.
Then they're dumbasses.
That's right.
And that's why they need you to tell them what to buy.
I think you are just tailor-made for this job.
Heck, I go in to buy something, all I know is what color I want.
You're one of them.
I think you should be nice to me, Red.
Because I think I might be interested in purchasing a mattress.
Kitty, we don't even sell I miss Eric.
You still have me.
It's not the same, Jackie.
I can talk to Eric about things that I can't talk about with you.
Okay, like what?
For instance, the annoying things that you do.
Michael!
See?
I can't talk to you.
Hey, Eric, how's it So, what is everyone looking at?
What are we looking at, man?
We haven't seen you in days.
What, Hyde?
You had to walk all the way home from school again?
That's not the only reason we're upset with you.
That's my only reason.
- I thought you had another reason.
- No, that's pretty much it.
Where's Buddy?
Buddy?
Buddy got busy.
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure he has a lot to do.
He is popular.
Yes, and so obviously gay.
Buddy is not gay!
Please, Fez.
That's just stupid.
If Buddy was gay, he would have been all over me.
He would've.
See you guys later.
So, Forman.
Now that the scary kids are gone is Buddy gay?
- I don't think it's really my place to - He's gay.
Okay, guys, hypothetical situation, crazy scenario wouldn't happen in like a million years.
Let's just Let's say, okay.
That Buddy made a move on me.
Eric, he's not gonna make a move on you if he knows you're straight.
I don't know.
I mean, Forman is pretty irresistible.
I don't think he'll make a move on me again.
Again?
Or for the first time.
You know I gotta go.
You know, Donna if Forman ever decides to dabble in the love that dare not speak its name I'm here for you.
You got your variable speed here.
It's completely stainless steel throughout.
So you know it'll last forever.
Comes with everything you see.
And so, the only decision you'd have to make is what color you want.
- I'll take white.
- Can't go wrong there.
Thank you so much.
You know you're the most helpful salesman I've ever had.
Thank you.
You go ahead and look around.
I'll write this up.
I sold a Mix Master.
Jeez, Red, that's great.
What did I tell you?
Today is your day.
Hello, Kitty guess who sold a Mix Master?
Hey, Buddy.
I'm gonna need those chemistry notes back.
Yeah.
Listen, man, if you don't want to be my lab partner anymore then I'll understand.
No.
I didn't mean it like that.
Look, we're still friends.
Really?
Yeah.
Actually, Buddy I wanted to ask why me?
I don't know, man.
You know it's probably the same reason that Donna likes you.
You know, you're smart and sensitive and nice-looking.
Okay, first of all, I'm not really that smart.
Those notes I gave you, copied.
Okay, and as for sensitive, sometimes I can just be downright mean.
You are so cute.
Well, that is I guess I am.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Man, the Grinch has a big butt.
Yes.
Nothing says Christmas like a big, green Grinch ass.
Hold the ladder for me.
So, Eric, what are you doing Christmas Eve?
My parents are having the same, lame Christmas party they have every year.
All the adults: "Neighbor, is that mistletoe"?
All right, how does that look?
- It's great.
- Looks fabulous.
Guys, the ornaments are up here.
- Yeah.
- Looks great.
I just love Christmas.
It's all about good tidings and cheer.
And shopping.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what Jesus was going for.
I give, too.
Every year, my friends and I deliver gift baskets to the unfortunate.
I think you mean less fortunate.
Okay, whatever.
Bums.
What are you guys doing watching cartoons?
Holiday Inn is on.
Where the treetops glisten La, la, la, listen Eric, come on, help me get the decorations.
Sure, Mom.
You know what my favorite Christmas gift of all time is?
Lite Brite.
It's fun making things with Lite Brite.
It is.
Man, my favorite gift is cash.
That way you can buy whatever you want.
Know what I mean, Donna?
Like, let's just say somebody gave you $6 and some change, right?
You know, to buy a present.
What would you get?
Hyde, it doesn't matter how much a gift costs as long as it's personal and sentimental.
You know what's both personal and sentimental?
Diamonds.
We were going through a box of Christmas decorations and we found the Christmas rat.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So Laurie, seeing anyone special at college?
I like to date around.
Slut!
Bless you.
Thanks, Mom.
Dad, instead of being at your party this year I was thinking of throwing a party in the basement.
I mean, I think I'm old enough.
Fine.
Fine?
Every year he just mopes around here like it's the end of the world, anyway.
All right!
Thanks, Dad.
So now who's going to sing the high parts on The Little Drummer Boy?
Traditionally it's the man who can't grow facial hair.
Dad, one more thing about the party.
I need some money.
All right, Eric.
I want you to pick out this year's tree.
And, whatever you don't spend you can use for your party.
You know how much I hate haggling with those tree Haggling is part of being an adult.
Here's $40.
- I want $50.
- Knock it off!
Pick out a good one.
Okay, fine.
Throw your party.
But can I at least make you some punch and cookies?
- Mom, no.
- Just punch?
No, Mom.
You can't have a Christmas party without punch.
That's just insanity!
Merry Christmas.
You know, Bob, I just want to thank you again for the job, you know?
I always need extra help during the holidays.
I feel like you're my second-in-command around here.
So listen how about you close up for me on Christmas Eve?
Why would we be open?
It's a big night, Red.
See, picture a guy driving home from work on Christmas Eve.
Fa la la la la Bob, nobody works on Christmas Eve.
All of a sudden, he realizes he forgot to buy a gift!
Then he passes by the store here, sees we're the only place open.
So what does he do?
He comes in here and buys a fridge.
So this guy's insane?
Not my place to judge.
- So what do you say?
- Fine.
I knew I could count on you, Red.
Of course, you'll have to wear the Santa Claus suit.
You got me there, Bob.
No, I'm serious, Red.
No.
You got me there, Bob.
Forman, man, would you relax?
This is a good plan.
We cut down the tree, keep the $40 for beer.
Car.
Where?
Kelso, "car" means get down.
Okay, I'm done.
No, I disagree, Kelso.
See, if you were done the tree would probably be more horizontal.
No, I mean I'm done.
Car!
All right, cut it yourself.
Fine, Kelso.
Do you believe him?
Hyde, did you have to write your name in the snow so close to the tree?
Sorry.
Now we got $40 for beer.
You know what else we should do?
Not get any presents.
No presents.
That way, we got more money for beer.
Shut up!
Eric.
This is the most beautiful tree I think we have ever had.
And it's just It's so fresh.
Mrs. Pinciotti?
Look, I was thinking about getting a present for this girl.
And you know, she's about Donna's age so I was kinda wondering what Donna likes.
Perfume.
Donna wears White Shoulders.
It's not just for shoulders, you can wear it anywhere.
- Really?
- Sure.
Like your neck, or the mall.
Wow!
All right.
How much does a bottle of that run?
About $12.
What about a bottle of crappy perfume?
What does that run?
Gosh, I don't know.
I'll call Bob's mom.
You did not get this from a lot.
You stole it.
I haggled.
With who?
Smokey the Bear?
You stole it.
I mean, you're one to talk.
You're flunking out of college.
- How'd you know?
- I didn't.
Shut up!
- Shut up.
- You shut up!
You shut up!
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay, now be careful with this one.
- It's very, very old.
- It looks terrible.
Laurie, hang that one around on the back side.
Okay, Grandma.
You know, Kitty, you've got two red ones together.
So I do.
Thank you, Bernice.
Eric, help me hang these stupid ornaments.
I can't.
I'm planning a party.
I don't get it.
How come the little drummer boy gets to have a party?
Because I asked, you stupid sister.
That's not clever.
I don't have time to be clever.
I'm planning a party, Miss Dumb girl.
I'll get it.
Hi, is Michael here?
There's no Michael here.
You have the wrong address.
Michael, I want you to drive me and my friends around on Christmas Eve.
Why?
To distribute gift baskets to the less fortunate bums.
Okay, but we better be back in time for the party.
Yes.
Perhaps you lovely ladies would like to join us?
I don't think so.
We are supposed to be helping the less fortunate.
Okay.
Jackie, come here.
Why?
Just come here.
Hyde, if you want to make out with me, the answer's probably no.
Yeah, okay.
Look, Jackie I know this girl, right?
- And I want to get her a Christmas present.
- My God, it's Donna!
It's not Donna.
Okay, it's not Donna.
So how much do you have to spend?
- $6.
- You don't deserve a girl like Donna for $6.
- I'm not trying to get Donna.
- Good, 'cause you won't, for $6.
You know what?
Thanks a lot, never mind, bye-bye.
We will see you tomorrow, babes.
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What the hell are you doing?
What?
Buying Donna a gift.
You know Eric likes her.
I know, man, but, you know, they're not officially Still, in my country, I would string you from the tallest tree.
We're not in your country, Fez.
Right.
So good luck with Donna.
Remember, every day is Christmas at Bargain Bob's!
We're back from the store.
Kitty, I made a few changes on your grocery list.
I don't like your taste in dip.
No, Laurie.
No, that punch is for Eric's party.
Here, why don't you take this tonic out to the bar?
Make sure we have enough rum and vodka.
All that rum and vodka.
Kitty, you have a problem.
- It's for the party, Bernice.
- That's convenient.
All I know is that my Red didn't start to drink until he met you.
And I didn't start to drink until I met you.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, Bernice, here, help me get more of the party supplies.
Merry Christmas.
Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum.
This should probably go here.
Mistletoe?
Yeah, it's really more for decoration.
- Is that a fact, neighbor?
- No.
Here, Eric, where do we put the beer?
Put it in the ice chest.
Okay, now, here you go.
Punch and cookies, just like I promised.
- No, Mom!
Mom!
- Eric, Mom made it for you.
The least you could do is drink a lot of it.
You know, you two you are just the best Christmas present a mother could have.
Hello, Laurie.
Kelso.
So Cool.
Merry Christmas.
Punch.
- Yeah.
Can I pour you some?
- No, thank you.
But if you would like you can bend over and put my gifts under the tree.
Gifts?
No, I thought we said no gifts.
No, Kelso, you said no gifts.
What's Christmas without gifts?
Yeah, man.
Where's your heart?
Nobody tells me anything around here!
Now I gotta go get something for Jackie.
She'll kill me!
Cheer up.
Have some punch.
I don't want any punch.
I gotta get a gift for Jackie.
Who I'm breaking up with.
Hi, Mr. Forman.
Kelso, what are you doing here?
It's Christmas Eve.
I know, I'm looking for a Christmas gift.
You know, you're the only place in this whole town that's open.
Yeah, I know.
What can I get for $17?
We've got some really nice heavy-duty extension cords.
No.
How much is that refrigerator?
Hello, ladies.
So glad you could make it.
May I get you something to drink?
We have beer, you know.
- What else do you have?
- We have punch, but we also have beer.
Punch is fine.
Punch it is.
Okay.
Would you like to chase down that punch with a nice beer?
I am kicking your ass!
Good game, Mr. Forman.
You're leaving?
Come on, we'll play another game.
- No, Jackie's waiting for me.
I really - One more game, come on.
You know who you remind me of?
Freddy Prinze.
No, Ricardo Mottleblonde.
You said, "mottleblonde".
No, I didn't.
Okay, shut up.
Okay, Fez I want you to say something, like, really slow.
Hello, my darlings.
And when I say hello, you know what I mean.
He was my friend first.
Man, what's going on with the pep squad?
Yeah, they seem extra stupid tonight.
Jackie, this is for you.
Michael, what is it?
It's hot rollers!
And with steam!
Mele kalikimaka is the thing to say On a bright Hawaiian Christmas day Hiya, Red.
How'd it go tonight?
I sold a set of hot rollers, Bob.
And a pong game.
I'll get it.
- May I help you?
- Ma'am, do you own the 1969 tan Oldsmobile station wagon in the driveway?
No, I don't.
Do you know who does?
Yes, I do.
Could you get them, please?
Sure.
Red!
Sir, we believe your vehicle was involved in the unlawful removal of state property.
- What?
- We're gonna have to confiscate that tree.
The tree?
No, I mean, it's all done.
I mean, look at it.
No!
I got you something.
It's no big deal.
But, you know, Christmas.
Suddenly Hyde's getting bashful?
Oh, wow!
This is great.
- What is it?
- It's a picture of me and Hyde.
Yeah, it's me and you in fifth grade.
I've had it in my drawer forever, so I just framed it.
That is so sweet.
Yeah, that is so sweet.
Look, why don't you open my present?
White Shoulders.
I love this stuff.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
My God you can see my training bra through my shirt.
Yeah, I remember that training bra.
I wish I'd - gotten you something like - Man.
Dude, it's nothing.
- It's not nothing.
- This is so thoughtful.
It's the sweetest thing anyone's ever given me.
Next to the perfume.
Right.
I wrapped it myself.
I know how you like things wrapped.
Eric before you explain the beer maybe you can tell me why there are two state troopers in the living room confiscating our Christmas tree?
That funny story, and a true story.
You're gonna laugh Get to the point!
We cut the tree off the side of the interstate.
That's just great, Eric.
Now the party's over, you're grounded, and I want what's left of my $40.
Kelso, give it to him.
Oh, no!
Yeah, I sort of spent it on Jackie's gift.
Michael, my hot rollers!
You got in trouble for me, Michael?
I love you, Michael!
God bless us, everyone!
And Hyde loves Donna.
She's crazy, man!
Eric, what the hell is going on here?
- Have these girls been drinking?
- No.
Look, Dad, I swear.
Just Mom's punch.
Lousy with hooch!
You see?
You see, Red?
She's drunk, man.
That's drunk talk.
False.
Come on, Jackie.
I'll take you and the "sob sisters" home.
Eric, the rest of that beer goes in my refrigerator.
Donna, your father's upstairs.
I suggest you join him.
Steven, you help Eric clean up.
And Kelso go home!
Eric, do something.
Your father's taking my women!
Thanks for the gifts, guys.
Merry Christmas.
So what'd you get?
ID Bracelet.
Cool.
- Is your name on it?
- Yeah.
What'd you get?
- Tube socks.
- Good!
I mean, tube socks are good.
Thanks for working tonight.
Sorry it was a slow night.
- No problem.
- Merry Christmas, Red.
Merry Christmas, Bob.
Now give me a hug.
No, Bob.
Really, I'm fine.
- It's the '70s.
Men can hug.
- No, Bob, they can't.
Come on, it's Christmas.
Look, mistletoe.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
All right, this is no sweat.
If we leave right after school we should make it to Jackie's ski cabin by, like, 6:00.
Man, I can't wait.
A trip to my favorite place.
Anywhere but here.
And I'm betting that Alpine Valley is gonna give the kid many make-out opportunities with Donna this weekend.
- The kid is in.
- What's with the whole "kid" thing?
It's cool.
It's not cool?
Not cool.
Dorky.
Guess who made out with Pam Macy behind the gym?
Everyone.
No!
Me!
Kelso, a lot of people hang out behind the gym.
Yeah, that's what's so great about it.
Everybody saw it!
That's great, man.
Yeah.
Because now everybody can tell Jackie, you moron.
Then she's gonna dump you and we won't be able to go up - to her ski cabin.
- She's never gonna find out.
You are a dog, Michael, a dirty, dirty dog!
- What did I do?
- You kissed Pam Macy.
I trusted you, Michael, and now all my friends are laughing at me.
I can't even show my face in the third floor bathroom anymore.
And that's the cool bathroom.
- But, I - No, Michael.
We're through.
Okay.
If that's the way you want it, we're through.
And Monday, when we get back from that ski trip, it's over.
No, Michael, no.
You won't be skiing this weekend.
That's just great, Jackie.
Cancel the ski trip and disappoint all our friends.
No.
We are still going.
They're surely not going without me.
Right, guys?
And did I mention my parents are not coming so it'll be just us?
So, we'll see you Monday!
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So, Eric's going away for the weekend.
Whole house to ourselves.
You know what that means?
Dinner in front of the TV.
No.
You dog.
Now, Eric, you're gonna be driving in snow so I'll put together an emergency roadside kit for you.
- In case you run into trouble.
- Okay, that'd be great.
Preparation makes all the difference, Eric.
Take kitty litter.
I can't tell you how many times kitty litter got me out of a tight spot.
I remember one time in the '70s.
Oh, my God, Eric.
Oh.
It's a road flare.
A road flare can save your life.
I said, "A road flare can save your life".
What?
Check.
Great.
Road flare.
Right.
Okay, now, good.
How was school today?
Okay, you know my PE Teacher, Coach Wilson?
He had this crusty stuff in the corner of his lip.
So Kelso says to him "Coach, check out that crusty stuff" Last week, the coach Dad?
Dad, are you even listening?
Of course I'm listening.
And you know what I'm hearing?
You need to buckle down.
I've told you over and over again that school is so important.
What you do now determines Red, that is so good.
Right there.
That hasn't been touched in years.
Donna, man, I brought my double sleeping bag.
You know?
Great.
Can Eric and I borrow it?
Hyde, watching you fail over and over it is like Charlie Brown and the football.
Yeah, man, I just don't get it.
No, because Eric already has it.
Hey.
Hey, Kelso.
Look, I just wanna make sure we're cool.
'Cause this weekend is, like, really important for me and Donna.
So, thanks for understanding.
Yeah.
I understand.
I understand that we're not friends anymore.
Look, man, you brought this on yourself.
I know I did, but that's no reason for me to suffer.
No, that is a great reason for you to suffer.
- I'm going.
- Fine.
Go.
See if I care.
Come on, Eric.
Come on, man.
- Here's your emergency roadside kit.
- Kitty litter?
Kitty litter.
Right.
Honey, I put some sandwiches in your duffel bag.
Now why do you need such a big bag of oregano?
Donna's Italian.
Okay, stay warm.
Okay, I see what's going on.
You're not really going skiing.
This is all just a gag.
You're trying to get me all worked up so you can go, "Just kidding, buddy"!
Yeah, you got me.
That's a nice burn.
It sure is.
Bye-bye.
He's not going.
He'll be back.
Any second now.
He's probably just going around the block.
I gotta hand it to him, he got me there.
That's a major burn.
Yup.
There he is.
I knew it!
No, that's not him.
I have never seen snow before.
It is so beautiful.
Do you know what the best part of this whole trip is?
That Michael is not here.
He'd just be sitting here telling me how cute I look in my fur-trimmed coat.
I know I look cute.
I don't need him here for that.
Forman, man, what's all this crap that Red gave you?
I don't know.
He's obsessed with kitty litter.
I think he might be going insane.
Far out.
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
I guess we hit some ice.
Great, we're stuck.
Look, I made my first snowball.
I love snow so much, my fingers are numb with joy.
That's frostbite, Fez.
How rude.
I hate your white man's winter.
Get in the car, Fez.
Eric, do something.
Yeah, man, stop goofing around.
It's freezing.
This is awful.
We're all going to die and I love Michael.
Shut up!
Okay, think, Eric, think.
Why kitty litter?
Use the gum, Eric.
Dad?
What're you doing here?
I'm not here.
You're imagining me.
Now who's insane, Mr. Smartmouth?
I guess I am.
Use the gum to stick the candle in the can.
The candle heats the can, which melts the snow behind the tire.
Then pour on the kitty litter for traction.
Now you think you can handle that?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Because you don't want me back out here.
I may be a figment of your imagination I'm still freezing my ass off.
Michael, what are you doing down here?
You know what?
I think Eric actually went.
What a jerk.
Why don't you just go to Jackie's cabin and talk to him?
I can't, I don't have a car.
Besides, Jackie hates me forever 'cause I kissed Pam Macy.
You know, when Mr. Forman and I were dating I saw him kissing a girl in a movie theater once and I forgave him.
You forgave him for kissing another girl?
Yes, sir.
I mean it wasn't so much kissing as it was a groping sloppy, pawing, nibbling nightmare.
But you forgave him.
Yeah.
I forgave the bastard.
Cool!
Okay.
Candles, check.
Chianti, check.
Fancy nut mix, check.
And how's my pretty lady?
You are so full of crap.
Hello there.
Thanks for stopping.
Are you going all the way to Alpine Valley?
I'm going wherever you're going.
Wow.
That's lucky.
So tell me, did it hurt?
What?
When you fell down from heaven.
No, I'm fine.
All right, we made it!
Yeah, just in time.
That storm was getting nasty.
I am so cold.
The snow has stolen my manhood.
There's only one bedroom.
It was gonna be for Michael and I, but since our love is Dead you two should take it.
All right.
Want to go check out our room?
Definitely.
Where are you guys going?
I thought we were gonna hang the I am freezing.
The winter in my country is 70 degrees.
We must hold each other for warmth.
Stop touching me!
But I am going to die!
Okay, Fez, amaretto.
You know what, man?
This'll warm you right up.
Take a sip of that.
Yum, liquid candy.
Kitty, you're talking about something that happened over 20 years ago.
And there you were at the movies, in front of God and everybody slurping on horse face Lyn Taylor like she was a Popsicle.
Kitty A big, easy, horse-faced Popsicle.
Horse face?
She was a runner-up in the Miss Wisconsin pageant.
Which she lost because she was such a horse face.
Thanks for the burger.
And the hat.
I just like to see that smile.
You seem kinda down about your friend Eric.
Yeah.
It's just, you know, he's always been there for me.
Like when people used to call me dumb he'd say, "He's not as dumb as you think".
People don't like to talk about it but guy-to-guy relationships are pretty special, you know?
They can be the most beautiful thing in the world.
I don't know why I do this stuff.
It's just, like I get these urges, you know, and I can't control them.
Shoot, I wrote that country song.
I've been cheated Been mistreated When will I be loved That's probably just Jackie crying.
Yeah.
All right, that's too much.
Can you please go out there and break that record?
What's going on?
"Spy vs.
Spy," man, they kill me.
No, with her.
She seems upset or something.
Okay, look, where's Fez?
Fez?
He killed that entire bottle of amaretto and then he ran outside, saying he had to make a snow angel.
But he was in his underwear.
Look, you either need to go get Fez or console Jackie.
All right, I'll take Donna.
- Jackie.
- Yeah.
Jackie.
Okay.
Yeah, okay, I can see you're upset.
Now, listen, all right?
If it's any consolation Pam Macy would give it up to anybody.
What do you know?
We're all alone.
God, Hyde, you can be such a jerk, you know that?
- Come on, I'm just goofing around.
- No, you're not.
Look, I'm up here with Eric.
All right?
- Get it?
Not you.
- I know, okay?
Look, do you think I like hitting on my best friend's girlfriend?
I don't.
But I look at you, I mean, look at you.
I can't help it.
You better.
It's so clear to me now.
I can't just go around using people as my sexual playthings.
You know what I mean, Gus?
'Cause people's feelings are way more important than those sexual urges.
You're good people, son.
You, too, man.
This is where you get off.
And one more thing.
Next time, take a bus.
You're too pretty to hitch.
Thanks, man.
Bye, Gus.
Fez!
Hey, man.
- Kelso.
You're here.
- Yeah.
I got a ride with the nicest guy.
Listen, I had a lot of time to think on the way up here.
And, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I should never have come up here without you, man.
I am a winter nymph.
I love the snow.
Hooray America!
Michael!
You walked all the way here in a driving snowstorm just to be with me didn't you, Michael?
And you would never ever do that for Pam Macy, would you?
No?
Lover.
You know it.
Could one of you guys put his pants on?
Kitty, this can't just be about me and Lyn Taylor.
- What's really bothering you?
- Okay.
I just want to know why not me?
Why not you what?
I married you.
Yeah, but when we were dating, you just sat there.
You held my hand politely.
Didn't you think that I might enjoy a passionate manhandling in a public place?
I respected you.
I'm an old-fashioned guy.
I don't think that you should grope and maul the one you love.
Until you get to Florida at the Fontainebleau with the door locked and a carton of cigarettes.
Red, our honeymoon.
Let's go upstairs.
No.
Let's go to the movies.
Here we are.
Yep.
So, I still can't believe that Kelso cheated on Jackie with Pam Macy.
I mean, that is just a seriously uncool move.
Yeah.
I mean, to risk everything for Eric, I would never do that to you.
You can trust me.
Really?
Absolutely.
I would never kiss Pam Macy behind the gym.
Never say never, Donna.
This night turned out okay.
Pretty romantic.
Yeah, it's just how I imagined it.
Just you and me I do not feel too good.
Thank you.
Okay, maybe it's not just how I imagined.
Cover your ears, this part gets pretty gross.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Forman, man.
It's a tiny, little scratch.
And Red's never gonna see it.
No, Red sees everything.
He sees when I put cheap gas in the car.
I got it.
We'll put my "gas, grass, or ass" bumper sticker over it.
Listen, Forman, whatever happens, we'll all take the rap.
Yeah.
How'd you scratch the car, Eric?
Have fun.
Later.
See you, Forman.
Well?
Well Sir, I was pulling out of this parking space.
Creeping is more like it.
I was creeping You were screwing around, backed into a hydrant.
- I see the paint marks.
- No!
And by "no," I mean "exactly".
Yeah, but it wasn't my fault, sir.
Kelso was giving me a A what?
Kelso was giving me a purple nurple.
It's when you grab somebody's nipple through their shirt and twist it really hard until it becomes purple.
Give me the keys.
Dad, I Your driving privileges are suspended until you learn some responsibility.
- Dad, I'm very responsible.
- No, you're not.
Responsible people don't go around getting their nipples twisted.
See, when you say it though, it just sounds weird.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Love!
Oh, my God.
"Hair Do's and Don'ts of Olympic Gold Medalists".
Oh, my God, is that Dorothy Hamill?
She's a virgin.
Speaking of You know, those girls at school who do it, like, all the time?
Yeah.
All right, is it just me, or do they seem more relaxed?
Hi.
What are you guys doing?
They are talking about sex.
Come on, Fez, chicks don't talk about sex, man.
It's dirty.
Yes, we do.
Especially when it involves Michael Kelso, my dreamboat.
Great.
Now we have to talk about Jackie and Kelso's sex life.
This is my worst nightmare.
All right, you know what?
Before you guys got here Jackie and I were actually having a pretty good time.
I know.
I was surprised, too.
- Donna, you wanna go to my house?
- You know what?
Okay.
- So what do you guys wanna do?
- We could walk to The Hub.
Too far.
- We could walk to - Too far.
Man, this sucks.
I just can't believe that Red took away my car because of one stupid little scratch.
I know, man.
Who would think Red would overreact?
I did.
I have noticed Red is a real hard-ass.
One toe over the line, sweet Jesus, you are clobbered.
You know what I'm saying?
Hey, guys.
Check it out.
Did you get a car?
Yeah.
My cousin Sully loaned me his wheels.
Yes.
So where to?
You just want to hang?
- Yeah.
- Cool.
Snookums?
Yes, Pookie?
Do you want turkey or tuna sandwiches tonight for dinner?
Tonight?
Tonight's meatloaf night.
Right, but I have my class at the community college in Kenosha tonight.
- I told you about it last week.
- You most certainly did not.
Yes, I did, remember?
You were watching Baretta.
Midge, you can't tell me anything while I'm watching Baretta.
It's complicated.
Bob, I've been telling you for months how I've needed to expand my mind.
Is this about jewelry?
'Cause I'll buy you jewelry.
No, sweetie.
It's about me becoming a whole person.
Midgie, don't take this the wrong way, but that's just stupid.
I don't think it's your decision.
I'm the man of the house and I say you're not going to community college.
You can't tell me what to do, you big ass!
What are we looking at?
That scratch.
What scratch?
The scratch that Eric put in the car.
I got most of it out with rubbing compound but you should have seen it before.
It was a doozy.
That must have been quite an accident.
Was he killed?
See, that's where his smart mouth comes from.
Driver safety is serious business, Kitty.
You're right, Red.
We should teach him a lesson.
So when he comes home, I'll hold him down and you burn him with a cigarette.
Just so you know, Donna, when I finally decide to do it with Michael I have the whole thing planned out.
First I'll be wearing a very sexy Renoir.
Don't you mean peignoir?
Yeah, okay, whatever.
Stop ruining this, Donna.
Okay.
And then there'll be candles everywhere.
And also, there'll be a gigantic banner.
And then Michael will come in.
And the wind will be blowing and then we will have the most magical night of our lives.
So, if you have it all planned out why are you still waiting?
I want it to be really special.
I mean, how could it not with a gigantic banner?
Exactly.
Bob doesn't want me to take this class, but it sounds so exciting.
It's all about female empowerment.
It's called, "The Woman Warrior: "Fighting Female Stereotypes".
That's the professor.
Isn't he cute?
Darling.
So you want to come?
I can't say I'm not tempted.
Yes, I can.
I'm not tempted.
Don't you want to become an empowered woman?
You know, I just I don't have time to be an empowered woman.
I'm too busy running this household.
You're so lucky, Kitty.
You have it all.
A great family and a great career.
How did you talk Red into letting you work?
Okay, well, one day we sat down, we did all our bills and we realized we were going to lose the house.
This backseat sucks.
Plus it's too small.
Fez's leg is touching mine.
No.
Your leg is touching mine.
I shouldn't even be in the back seat.
You know, I should be driving my own car.
The reason you're not driving your own car, Forman is because you're irresponsible, and you scratched it.
Yeah.
That's a good one.
I'm trying to drive the car here, man!
No.
Put it back, I like that song.
Pipe down, now, back seat Charlie.
All right.
The back seat sucks.
Welcome to my sad little world.
When you drive home tonight please remember to drive carefully.
Great, no pickles.
Now we gotta go back.
Shut up!
Why does Sully have a statue of the Virgin Mary on his dashboard?
Maybe he's, like, religious or something.
Wasn't Sully in prison for arson?
Yeah.
People who burn stuff believe in God, too, Hyde.
Why does his key chain say, "I love Bingo"?
Sully must love Bingo.
All right, I'm starting to think that maybe this isn't Sully's car.
Then whose car is it?
Yeah This is great.
I'm dead.
When we were in my car, and I was running the show I don't remember one single time we all got arrested.
That's true.
Eric, will you just relax?
We're all in trouble here.
No.
We're not all in trouble here.
Your parents have seven kids.
They won't even notice you're gone.
Your parents don't even live in this country.
And your mom, probably one cell over.
So, that just leaves me.
I'm the only one who's really in trouble here.
Look, Forman, I'll be in as much trouble as you as are as soon as Edna sobers up.
I will be deported.
They're gonna send me back to my homeland, the beautiful island of Okay, who's the ringleader here?
He is.
- You get one phone call.
- To anywhere?
One local phone call.
So who should we call?
I'd call Red, but I feel safer in jail.
I don't know my phone number.
I can't call Edna, man.
It's poker night.
No offense, but isn't every night poker night for Edna?
I know.
I got it.
I'll call Jackie.
Her dad's a lawyer, and she's got a checkbook.
Hello?
Jackie!
Thank God you're home.
I was driving a stolen car and I got arrested.
Michael, this is just like the book Prisoner of Love where Cliff, the rugged yet sweet motorcycle mechanic was thrown into jail.
And then his true love, Tasha, was forced to be a slave girl for this really rich, mean guy.
Jackie, I'm not kidding around.
I'm really in jail.
My God.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I guess.
But I'm a little cold.
It's lonely in the joint, Jackie.
My God.
You're really in jail.
What if you never get out?
That would really suck.
Yes, it would, Michael.
And I promise the minute you get out of prison, I'm gonna prove my love to you.
Cool.
Thanks.
Michael, do you even know what I'm saying to you?
Yeah.
No.
We're gonna make love, you idiot.
All right!
You two have a nice little talk?
Yeah.
- You know what's funny?
- What?
Nothing!
Because you forgot to ask her for help, you moron!
My God, you're right.
Give me another dime.
We only had one dime.
We only got one phone call.
My God.
Somebody give me a spoon.
I'm gonna dig my way out of here.
Look at this.
Here we are sitting down to dinner and Eric's not even home yet.
Honey, you took away his car.
He has to walk everywhere.
Walking is good for him.
Red, why do you have to be so hard on him?
Same reason my old man was hard on me.
To prepare me for the world.
You know, Kitty, when I was his age I could have parachuted onto a deserted island with nothing but a Swiss army knife, and I would've survived.
Okay, then we've learned something.
No skydiving for Eric.
I'll tell you, Kitty, the world is a tough place.
You drop your guard for one second and it'll kick you right in the ass.
Well, you're right.
Red, the world is hard.
So wouldn't it be nice if Eric came home to a place that wasn't?
All right, Kitty, when you win the lottery you can buy him Disneyland.
I can't believe she went to that class.
Married women do not abandon their families.
Sure they do, Dad.
It's the '70s.
I know what decade it is.
Doesn't change the fact I'm eating a sandwich instead of a hot meal.
You want me to microwave it for you?
I just don't understand why she needs this.
- I've given her a great life.
- Dad, that's not the issue.
The whole point of the Equal Rights Amendment is so that women don't have to define themselves by a man.
Donna, is this about clothes?
'Cause I can buy you clothes.
This is pointless.
While you're up, you wanna get daddy a beer?
Honey?
Eric, you've gotta do something, man.
Me?
What about you, Kelso?
Or Hyde?
I can't talk to cops, man.
I go insane with rage.
And me, too.
Nuts.
Eric, you gotta help us.
So now I'm back in charge?
This is so typical.
Okay, you know what?
Fine.
Once again, I'll suck it up, be the man and save all your sorry asses.
Officer, I need to talk to you, please.
You gotta let me go!
Please, God.
My dad's gonna kill me.
You stole a car, kid.
What kind of cop would I be if I just let you go?
My best friend the cop?
Look, it really wasn't my fault.
We borrowed it from a friend.
Yeah, haven't heard that one before.
Guess what?
They didn't really steal the car.
They borrowed it from a friend.
Actually, they did.
Turns out this guy Sully borrowed it from his grandmother and she forgot and called it in stolen.
Nice old lady, though.
She plays Bingo.
- My God, this is great.
So, we're free to go?
- Yeah.
Which one are you?
Eric Forman.
Forman?
Is your dad Red Forman?
Yeah.
You poor bastard.
- Well, thank you.
- Here.
- So?
- So call a cab.
We're sprung.
What?
We're free?
All charges dropped.
Wait, that is what you wanted, right?
Let's get the hell out of here.
Yeah.
Hi, Bob.
Midge, I've been thinking.
If taking that class made you happy, then I guess I'm happy.
Sweetie, it means so much to me.
And it's only twice a week, so it's not Whoa.
I thought this was a one-time deal.
Bob, you can't learn total female empowerment in one night.
It takes 10 nights.
Wait.
Midge, you are not going back.
Aphrodite, the Goddess of War wouldn't take this and neither will I!
Hey, Dad.
Hold it.
About the car.
I know it was And I You see, when I was a kid Maybe I came down Here's the keys.
Thank you, sir.
- So where you been all night?
- Prison.
Yeah, okay.
- Jackie.
- Michael, you've been sprung.
You don't know what it's like on the inside, Jackie.
Did they beat you?
Yeah.
Damn those police.
No.
It was Hyde.
But he really frogged me.
Poor baby.
Thanks, Jackie.
- Okay, so let's do this thing.
- This is so perfect.
I don't even miss the peignoir, the pirate shirt, or the wind.
What about the banner?
It's okay.
The important thing is, I'm here with you.
And I'm prepared to give myself to you body, mind, and soul.
Michael, this is going to be the most magical night of our lives.
Yeah, and one more thing.
My parents are at the A&P, so we only have, like, 15 minutes.
You guys enjoying your burgers?
Got enough pickles on them?
That's how Fatso Burger does them.
Lots and lots of pickles.
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
It's great.
Got enough room back there?
Actually, it's a little bit crowded.
Good.
That's the way it should be.
Yes, yes.
I feel like going to the movies.
Where do you guys wanna go?
- Let's go to the reservoir.
- Movies it is.
Yes, yes.
I kind of feel like going to the reservoir.
Reservoir it is.
Yes, yes.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- You and Jackie did not do it.
- No.
We so did it.
You're always saying that you did it.
Kelso, she wears the pants, and they have never come off.
Look at my face.
This is a face that did it.
Holy smokes, I think he did it.
- Kelso did it!
- I did it!
Yeah.
Congratulations, man.
- Plus, you did it in record time.
- Yeah, you think?
No, you moron.
You've been kissing her ass for over a year.
Yeah, but that's over, man.
It's hard to explain to you kids that have never had sex before but when you're with a woman, something chemical happens to her.
Now, Jackie is totally different.
She's like my love slave.
Yeah, I'm that good.
Hey, guys.
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?
Actually, I'm a little bit chilly.
But I left my coat up in the car.
I'll go get it for you.
Miss me.
Handy little thing, isn't she?
Okay, that was so cool.
- Cool?
- And by "cool" I mean "wrong and stupid".
All right, shut up.
Wrestling's back on.
I love wrestling!
Come on, you're not even fighting back.
Why would he fight back?
Don't forget, this Saturday night pro wrestling is coming to the National Guard Armory in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Watch Rocky Johnson take on 20 snarling midgets.
Now, back to the action.
Rocky Johnson's coming to Kenosha?
Man, we gotta go.
I'm in.
I love midgets, man.
Eric, I need to see you up here.
Okay, I'll be right up.
You are not going up?
I'll go up when I'm ready.
So I just said to myself: "I don't care if all I have is dirty laundry and no money.
"I'm going home to see my parents.
Because I love them very much".
Oh, my.
Well, will you look at these?
Yeah, Mom, all the girls are wearing them.
Eric, where have you been?
- Yeah, Eric, I called you five minutes ago.
- I was watching wrestling.
Did you take those books back to the library like I asked you?
Yeah.
I took them back.
Then why did I see them in the backseat of your car?
I took them back to the car.
Which means that they're practically at the library.
You know, Dad, I feel sorry for all the good kids who wanted to read those books.
That's who I feel sorry for.
Okay, it's five books.
A nickel a book.
Big deal, I'm out a quarter.
It's not about the money, son.
It's about the rules.
And without rules, we might as well all be up in a tree flinging our crap at each other.
Okay.
The library closes in a half an hour, so get your ass over there.
Dad, you know, all my friends are downstairs so Hey, pal, I'm not the bad guy here.
Now, you screwed yourself when you didn't return those books.
- Now go.
- Okay.
No.
Did you say, "no"?
Are you telling me, "no"?
Is that what I'm hearing?
Yeah.
Oh, dear.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Well, all right!
You know what's interesting?
No.
When you talk to Laurie, you actually have a conversation but with Eric, you just give orders.
Kitty, he said no to me.
He's getting older, Red.
I think it's time you two developed a friendship 'cause if you don't, he'll move away and we'll never see him again.
Is that what you want?
Red.
I can't be friends with Eric.
He's too twitchy.
Red, until I see you make some kind of effort I'm just gonna keep bringing it up.
Threats aren't gonna work, Kitty.
In the middle of every newspaper you're reading every nap you're taking, every football game you're watching I'll be there talking.
Bob, I'm thinking of starting therapy.
Okay, I'm gonna be Bye.
Therapy?
That's for crazies.
You know, the unexamined self is an unfulfilled self.
How can you be unfulfilled?
I put a roof over your head, I pay the bills, I take care of you.
- Yeah, but what do I do?
- You fill out that sweater real nice.
You are so cold!
What?
That's a compliment.
Sit down, Laurie, have some ribs.
Mom, you know I'm on my water and yogurt diet.
Okay, isn't this nice?
My whole family together.
Mostly.
Having family fun.
Because that's what dinner is for.
Right, Red?
Okay.
So.
Eric what happened at school today?
Why?
What'd you hear?
What's wrong with you?
I can't ask a simple question?
Red, you need some potatoes.
Good job on returning those books.
Yeah, I returned the books.
Even though it was kind of stupid.
What?
He said it was stupid, Daddy.
Okay.
Eric, what are you gonna do this weekend?
Me and the gang are gonna catch that wrestling match in Kenosha.
Now, isn't that something?
Because a certain Mr. Red Forman used to wrestle in high school.
No.
What I did then was real.
That stuff on TV, that's all an act.
I don't know.
I bet if the two of you went together, you'd really enjoy yourselves.
Right, guys?
- No, Mom, I don't - I'm really busy So, you're going.
And I think everyone has room to grow but Bob is perfectly satisfied and says just being his wife should make me happy.
Midge, let me stop you right there.
I know we've had only one session, but from what I'm hearing everything you say is completely right and everything Bob says is completely wrong.
I think I'm gonna like therapy.
I think therapy's gonna like you.
Jackie, what are you doing here?
You hate wrestling.
Michael likes it, and anything that Michael likes, I like.
'Cause I like Michael.
Yeah, that's my girl.
Oh, barf.
Come on, watch your legs.
Taking the gang to the wrestling matches?
I guess I'll just sit home alone tonight since Midge is going to some therapy thing.
I'll be alone.
Get in the car, Bob.
Eric, give me the keys.
Why can't I drive?
Because I want to get there in one piece.
Hey, can we get a move on?
If I Miss that 20-midget free-for-all, I'm gonna be super pissed.
Fine.
You drive.
Red.
You know, on second thought you should drive.
After all, tonight I'm just one of the gang.
This isn't gonna work, you know?
We're gonna kill each other.
Fine, kill each other.
Just do it together.
Both hands on the wheel, Eric.
- Dad, if you want to drive - No.
That's all right.
I'm just one of the gang.
Yield, damn it!
That sign says, "yield".
That's better.
Baby This is ridiculous.
When we get home tonight you better tell your mother we had a damn good time.
So far so good.
Yeah.
And now, I gotta go and spend $2 for a 10-cent beer.
Gee, I'm so glad our dads came.
- At least yours is leaving you alone.
- Yeah.
- Poor Fez.
- Yeah.
There I was sitting in the kitchen.
Sitting in the kitchen, when, boom!
She tells me she needs therapy.
Yeah, Midge and I had a beautiful thing, Fezzy then it all went wrong.
Yeah, Bob, women are hell.
Why don't you grab us all a beer and we'll talk it over?
I could get you sodas, 'cause I know you're underage.
Bob, this isn't about us.
It's about you.
And you need friends.
And beer.
How stupid do you think I am?
Why don't we grab a beer and we'll talk it over?
No.
Then, Bob, you're on your own.
See how you drive people away?
I'm telling you, after my therapy session, I felt so loose.
Loose is good.
If you ask me, we could all do with a little tightening.
And tonight, my therapist is hosting an encounter group but I'm too shy to go alone.
Well, too bad.
Kitty, please come with me.
I don't think so.
No, thank you.
No.
You know what this is a lot like?
Like when you asked me to help you host the bake sale.
Only it's different, because I said yes.
All right.
Great.
It's a gathering of his souls in progress.
Over drinks.
Free drinks?
I'm in.
That's nice.
That's music to a mother's ears.
Okay, what's going on here?
Okay, you see the guy getting in the ring?
That's Rocky Johnson.
Man, he's the best.
The best?
They're not even fighters.
I mean, it's all tricks.
I could get up there right now and Goddamn, he dropped that guy right on his head!
Yeah!
That's right.
I got him.
He ain't going anywhere.
One, two, three.
- The winner!
- Get off me!
I'm the winner here.
Yeah!
Man!
- Hot in here.
- You poor thing.
- Is that better, sweetie?
- Yeah!
- Jackie, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.
Michael, is it okay Jackie, what the hell is going on between you and Kelso?
Look, Michael Kelso and I have made beautiful love.
I mean No.
- Why are you being such a doormat?
- Look, I have to be nice.
What if he gets bored now?
Bored?
Jackie, he's gonna want to do it again.
So what you're saying is, I'm totally in charge.
I mean, a partnership No.
I own him!
I am the man.
Jackie No.
Thank you, Donna.
Good evening, sir.
I would like a refreshing cola, please.
And get me a beer, son.
Okay, Dad, sure.
And a beer for my dad.
You're not gonna get me that beer, are you?
What seems to be the problem, son?
What're you doing?
Don't just sit there!
Get up, you big moose!
Look, he's laughing at you!
I give and I give and I give!
Boo-hoo.
Get back in the ring!
Come on.
Hey, this is fun.
Rocky Johnson.
Mr. Johnson, sir, can I get your autograph?
Rocky!
Eric, go in there and get your autograph.
No way, Dad.
The sign says, "wrestlers only".
So?
So, that's a rule.
As I remember, a great man once said to me: "If we were to break the rules "the world would just be filled with tree-climbing crapflingers".
Yeah.
Follow me.
You want your autograph or not?
There he is.
Mr. Johnson, you gave that team of midgets an ass whupping, sir!
You pile drive a little guy and the whole crowd turns on you.
When you're standing there, wondering what they're booing about you get bit on the kneecaps.
Look at my knees.
Midget bites.
I wonder if you'd mind giving my son an autograph.
No.
No autographs.
Look, pal I might be the only guy in here who's actually killed a man.
Give the kid an autograph.
And then, no more autographs.
That's really nice.
Bringing your kid to a wrestling match.
You know, I've got a son.
And one day, he's gonna become the most electrifying man in sports entertainment.
Yeah, good luck with that.
Wanna make that out to Red Forman?
No.
I don't think so.
It's Eric Forman.
Capital E-R-I-C.
- Yeah, but see, his nickname is Red.
- No, it's not, it's Eric.
Stop kidding around, Red!
You know, babe, a soda would taste pretty good right about now.
Yeah, you're right.
A soda does sound pretty good.
- I'll have a diet.
- Yeah, I'll have a root beer.
Don't you want to go get it for me?
Sweetie?
Okay, let me clear it up for you.
Get me a soda.
Now!
Did you see that?
I'm the man.
It all started about six months ago when Midgie got a subscription to Cosmo.
These group sessions are about testing your boundaries losing your inhibitions, and really sharing with the group.
Kitty, are you ready?
Share a little, Mom.
Tell us how folding the dishtowels just right makes all our problems go away.
You want me to share?
Okay.
Laurie, you're mean to your brother and you're screwing around at college.
We don't even see you unless you run out of clean clothes or need cash.
The fact is, you're an ungrateful, spoiled brat.
Well, thank you.
That was nice.
I love you, honey.
Well, I hope you're all as excited about this journey as I am.
Let's pair off.
Okay, we're leaving.
I don't get it, Kitty.
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
He's a bad doctor.
A very bad doctor.
- Dad, thanks for letting me drive home.
- Thanks for not killing me.
You know, I just had a lot of fun tonight with you, Dad.
Yeah, me too.
All right, let's go.
- Want some?
- Yeah.
I wanna have a piece.
Yes!
Who's the king?
Who's the king?
My neck!
Gosh, Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Look, I had no Now who's the king?
You are.
And it turned out this therapist was just obsessed with sex.
And this is a really difficult time for me.
The last thing I need is a doctor who doesn't take me seriously.
I need to find someone I can talk to, someone who will really listen.
So.
Wanna go to a party?
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Get off me, you moose.
Eric, I didn't see you sitting there.
You should really work on bulking up.
Maybe you should really work on bulking up.
What are you watching?
Gilligan is on.
- What are you doing in the floor?
- Yeah.
Why don't you guys get a room?
We have a room, Hyde.
It's called my basement.
I'm going home.
Bye, guys.
Donna, don't forget.
I'll see you tomorrow night at the library.
- Yeah, right.
- I'll walk you home.
- She lives right next door.
- Yeah.
Donna, about tomorrow night.
I was thinking that maybe you and I could go out to dinner.
- For Valentine's Day?
- Hyde asked me to study at the library.
I mean, you can do that anytime, right?
Yeah, I'd love to go.
That's great.
So then it's a date.
Our first.
Yeah, if you don't count all the times I mauled you.
Yeah.
Which I don't.
So Hey, guys.
So, what's going on?
I'll talk to you guys later.
So, Eric what were you and Donna talking all hot and heavy about?
Your hair.
Really?
No.
We're going out to dinner tomorrow night.
For Valentine's Day.
No.
Donna and I are going to the library to study tomorrow night.
On Valentine's Day?
Who studies on Valentine's Day?
I didn't know it was Valentine's Day when I made the date.
To study.
I'm sure she just forgot about you.
We just talked about it a minute ago.
Women.
You know, I mean Anyway, I'm gonna give Donna my class ring.
No, forget rings.
You wanna score with Donna, use my super funk eight-track.
Anyway, I figure it's time to make it official.
She's just been waiting for any jerk to swoop down on her.
And you're that jerk.
Better me than some other jerk.
Why are you looking at me?
Hyde is the other jerk.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
So, if Eric and Donna are going out Saturday night that means we have no wheels.
I can borrow my dad's car.
It's a Lincoln.
Leather.
You know what we should do?
We should ditch Hyde and Fez and make out in the backseat.
You said that out loud.
Yeah, I don't care.
Yeah, I know.
We can go shopping for clogs.
Pick me up at 7:00.
Have fun, man.
I'm out.
We won't be shopping.
We'll be doing it.
Again.
'Cause that's what we do.
We do it!
Then I'm in.
No, you're not invited, Fez.
Then I'm out.
Yeah.
Well, later.
It looks like it's just you and me, little buddy.
Yeah, Fez.
Which is really wrong, man 'cause I had plans with Donna.
Until Forman snaked me.
Who would have thought she would rather go to a nice restaurant than a smelly, old library?
You will laugh later.
So, let me see.
Go ahead, show your mother.
Oh, my gosh, that is snazzy.
That is a snazzy jacket.
Damn good thing I went with him.
He wanted to buy a leisure suit.
Come on, Dad.
Leisure suits are cool.
Everybody wears them.
Leisure suits are for dumbasses.
Believe me.
Hey, there, Eric.
Looking sharp for your big date?
Who knew our two little tykes would grow up to be dating.
Oh, no.
I have an idea.
Let's have dinner tomorrow night.
Just the parents.
I'll fondue.
Yeah.
And that'll give us a chance to talk about their future.
Right.
We can plan a big wedding.
I know you're joking.
But could you please stop?
Please?
You know, I've You can borrow our car.
Girls love corsages.
They got a fried onion brick at The Vineyard, right?
I don't believe you, Michael.
What?
You can't just maul me in front of my father.
I bet he didn't even notice.
He yelled at you to stop it.
I thought he was talking to you.
Okay.
Michael, we have a problem.
Ever since we Did it?
Can you please use a more beautiful term?
Like what?
Like, proved our love.
Yeah.
But "did it" sounds so much cooler.
Okay, just take me to the mall.
We're not really going shopping, are we?
Yes, I need clogs.
Oh.
God darn!
That is a snazzy jacket.
Yes, sir.
Brown is your color.
Thanks, Dad.
No, Mom.
Let me tell you something, order the dinner.
A la carte's a sucker's bet.
And remember pull the chair out for her.
The small fork is for the salad.
And this jacket's gotta last you all the way through college so don't spill any crap on it.
Here you go.
Have fun.
Yeah.
- Shall we?
- Good God, yes.
Smile.
Now, if she gets to do it, I get to do it.
Kitty, he's leaving.
Talk about pressure.
Yeah, I mean, this is a huge deal.
To our parents.
So what do you wanna do?
I don't know, man.
What do you want to do?
Let's go to The Hub.
I've got my eye on this plump girl.
Sounds good, man, but I'll pass.
Poor Hyde.
What?
You love Donna, and she's with your good friend Eric.
And?
And that's the oldest story in the world.
And a sad one at that.
You know what, man?
I had a chance, and I didn't take it.
And once Forman gives her that ring, man, they're going out.
And it would be really scummy to hit on her then.
Not that I wouldn't do it.
It'd just be really scummy.
If you don't tell Donna how you feel, then you will regret it.
I'm going to The Vineyard.
Good for you.
Just don't tell Eric what I said because I really like his basement.
This is quite a menu.
Yeah.
You got enough money?
Yeah, for me.
I'm sorry.
Were you gonna eat something, too?
Actually, I'm in the mood for chicken.
What a coincidence.
I, too, am ordering the cheapest thing on the menu.
You look really nice tonight.
So do you.
Look, Donna Hello!
Can I start you folks off with drinks?
Sure I'll have a beer.
All right.
I'd like an iced tea.
- He didn't even proof me.
- It must be the jacket.
- Or my sideburns.
- What sideburns?
These sideburns, right.
You know, I don't know why they call it fondue.
They should call it fundue.
'Cause it is fun.
I love fondue.
It's gourmet.
- So, what do we do here, Kitty?
- Okay, now.
What you do is you put a piece of steak on your fondue fork.
- Now, how hot exactly is the - No, Bob.
That's a fondon't.
Don't put your hand in the hot oil.
Who knew you couldn't put your hand in the hot oil?
Here, chicken, chicken.
Donna, please.
Sorry.
- Are you okay?
- I am great.
I think you're drunk.
I think I am, too.
How could I be drunk?
There's about five shots of alcohol in a Long Island Iced Tea.
- Long Island Iced Tea?
- Yeah, you guys ordered drinks.
- I'm ready for another one.
- Nope, she's good.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I love your little butt, Eric.
It's so little.
Okay.
And you're so good, Eric.
You're so darn good.
- I think it's coffee time.
- You're so good, it makes me hot.
Or time for another Iced Tea maybe.
Sing to me, Eric.
No, I don't think Sing me a song.
I don't really Do it or I'll scream!
Move it in, move it out Shove it in, shove it out Disco lady Move it in, move it out Shove it in, all about Well, Jackie.
It's now 9:00.
Which means that every shoe store in the greater Oshkosh area is closed for the night.
So, what do you want to do now?
Let's go look at the new Corvettes.
Yeah.
I mean No, that just sounds boring.
What do you wanna do?
No, I don't know.
Wait.
You know what we could do?
We could Prove our love to each other again.
No, Michael.
We are not going to Prove our love, every single time we have a chance.
Why not?
Because it doesn't work like that.
And just because we did it once does not mean we're ever gonna do it again.
Okay, now you're just talking crazy!
No, Michael.
No, I am not.
If you think that's how it's gonna work, then you're wrong.
Damn, Jackie.
So I spent all night looking for your stupid shoes - and we're not even gonna - No.
Fine.
Are you sure you're okay with that?
Yeah.
Okay, let's do it.
- Crap.
- Ouch!
- Damn!
- Ow!
Geez!
My eye!
God.
It's so crowded in here.
Eric, meet me under the table.
Donna, no.
Look, no.
Look, Donna, come on.
Waiter?
Okay.
I'm gonna go get you some coffee.
So, no going under the table, and no singing.
I'll be right back.
People, the chicken here is excellent.
Hyde's here.
Hi, Hyde.
Hey, Donna.
Where's Forman?
Coffee.
Okay, look.
I'm just going to say this, all right?
Donna, I have feelings for you.
And I think that you have feelings for me.
And Forman's gonna give you his ring.
And I hope that before you take it, you think about Beep!
Eric.
Hyde's here.
We're on a date here.
Yeah, man.
You shouldn't be because we were supposed to be at the library.
Hyde, if she wanted to be at the library, she'd be at the library.
Oh, my God.
Wait.
What do you mean by "Oh, my God"?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Look, when my date's done puking you better not be here.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Could I get this in a doggie bag, please?
Thanks.
And I'm in a hurry.
Now I feel so close to you, Michael.
Michael and Jackie.
Jackie and Michael.
Doesn't that sound good?
Michael and Jackie.
True love, always, forever.
- Forever?
- Forever.
Dances, long walks candles, flowers.
Babies, house.
Shackle, chain despair, prison, death.
"Jonathan Seagull discovered "that boredom, fear, and anger "are the reasons a gull's life is so short.
"And with this gone from his thought "he lived a long, fine life indeed".
Bravo!
Isn't she a hot tomato?
To the lovemaking.
We had a wonderful time.
My God!
Okay, they're gone.
They used to be normal.
- What the hell happened to them?
- I don't know.
How can she not eat meat?
That can't be healthy.
Remember when we used to go on vacation together?
Bob and I used to go fishing and drink beers.
- I mean, we used to have fun with them.
- Now they're into every fad there is.
- Things change, Kitty.
- We don't.
We don't have to.
We're classic.
You know Midge wasn't wearing a bra tonight.
Yeah.
Bob wasn't wearing underwear.
Thanks for holding my hair when I was Just thanks for missing my shoes.
- I guess I blew our big night.
- No.
Look, it's cool.
I thought I was gonna blow it and then, I mean, you totally blew it.
So that's great.
You know, by telling me I blew it, you basically just blew it.
So And I was doing so good here with the jacket and the coffee and holding your hair back.
I was so in.
You're still in.
Look, Donna, I want to be your boyfriend.
And you're all I ever think about.
Will you wear my class ring?
- Yes.
- Yes?
You know, why don't we kiss on it later?
Right.
The vomit.
No, wait.
You know what?
I don't care.
You're my girlfriend.
So, Forman, man I'm sorry about tonight with Donna.
And for taking your dinner.
So, are we cool, man?
Yeah, man.
We've gotta be.
Look, we've been friends since kindergarten.
No girl's gonna come between us.
That's great, man.
So if Donna ever breaks up with you and starts dating me, are we still friends?
No.
Tonight, I learned there's a price to be paid for doing it.
She said, "forever," man.
And I think she meant it.
The inside of my mouth feels like cotton.
As if cotton was in my mouth.
Kelso, man, women are like muffins, okay?
And once you've had a muffin, man you will put up with anything to have another muffin.
And they know that.
Now she really owns you, man.
Hyde, you sure know a lot about women.
But, I mean, you've never really had a steady girlfriend.
So, what's that all about?
I'll tell you what that's all about, Forman.
My mind is pure, man.
I don't fall victim to the female race.
I'm here, sans girlfriend, to help you guys out.
Then I have a question, Hyde.
How much masturbation is too much?
No such thing as too much, Fez.
How'd it go?
It was great.
Mom.
Gotcha.
Anybody mention how nice that sport coat was?
Donna.
There you go.
So, you had fun?
Yeah, Dad.
Thanks.
You know, you got a chunk of carrot on your shoe there?
Yeah, Dad.
Thanks.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Yeah, that's a good sound.
Now, coming up in the second half-hour of American Bandstand: Shields and Yarnell, Elton John and Kiki Dee and now, The Spotlight Dance.
This is Mr. Lou Rawls.
Jackie!
Door!
Knock!
Sorry.
I didn't know you'd be doing anything so embarrassing.
- Is Donna here?
- No.
Look, I need to talk to someone.
I can really use a friend right now.
Okay, then.
Good luck with that.
Eric, can I talk to you?
Look, I've always been able to trust you and you're such a nice guy.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
Okay.
What happened?
Did Kelso forget your birthday or something?
I'm pregnant.
Eric, you're like a million miles away.
What's going on?
I have to tell you something, but you have to promise you won't tell anybody else.
Dirt!
I swear.
Now tell me.
Not here.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Of course I support the Wolverines.
I have to.
I'm a cheerleader, not a cheer-liar.
And then, in the dream, two of The Three Stooges fed me grapes while I played them a beautiful song on my accordion In the nude.
Somehow the accordion part bothers me more than the nude part.
- Michael, stop it!
- What'd I do?
Look, I just need all the food I can get right now.
Hi.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Jackie?
My God.
Donna, you have never asked me to go to the bathroom with you before.
Yeah, it's a big day.
Man, she has been acting so weird lately.
I'm telling you, guys, I think it's time I break up with her.
That's real nice.
Why don't you grow up?
So, is it true?
Yes, Donna, it is true.
I am carrying Michael Kelso's child.
Jackie, you're a sophomore.
How can you be so stupid?
I'm a sophomore.
Why didn't you, like, you know, use something?
Look, I would have but my cousin Carla told me that I could not get pregnant for eight days after my period.
Okay.
Eight days after your first day or your last day?
I don't know.
Carla never called me back.
My God, Donna, having this child is gonna ruin my whole life.
Yeah.
I'll have to wear flats, I'll gain weight, I'll be too fat to cheer.
Not to mention the fact you'll have a baby to take care of.
Donna, what am I gonna do?
I'm in such trouble.
Jackie, it's all right.
We'll get through this.
What does Kelso say about all this?
No!
I cannot tell Michael.
- It's way too embarrassing.
- Jackie!
- You had sex with him.
- I know I did.
But we didn't talk.
You have to tell Kelso.
If you don't, I will.
Thank you, Donna.
Jackie, I don't want to tell him.
I think he knows.
- What?
- Nothing.
We're just a little surprised that you're home, that's all.
It's no big deal.
You know, I just didn't feel like going away for spring break.
Honey, is there a warrant out for you in Fort Lauderdale?
Now, Kitty, I'm sure she's just home to spend time with us and Eric.
Why are you home?
Daddy, it was just a very, very tough quarter.
I'm sure you'll come through with flying colors.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, the whole concept of grades is so subjective.
It's really the experience of college that's important.
No, it's not.
Mail's here.
Nothing.
Sorry I was late.
We were at The Hub.
Then I had to drive everyone home, then Kelso says Blah, blah.
You're late.
Be responsible for your own actions.
That's real easy for you to say, pal!
That kid's on dope.
Don't want to miss Sanford and Son.
Mom?
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.
Okay.
A friend of mine, and it's not me is pregnant.
Is it you?
- No, Mom, not me.
- Thank God.
I just had the most horrible flashback to when I was 16 and You were saying, honey?
The whole pregnancy thing is just so scary and overwhelming.
Jackie, I mean my friend.
It is you, isn't it?
No.
She had one night of fun and now her whole life is out of control.
Are you worried about you and Eric?
No.
Maybe.
Yes.
Honey, let me just tell you what I think.
Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, things happen.
And the backseat of a car is no place to be worrying about birth control.
Thanks, Mom.
Sanford thinks he's having a heart attack.
It looks like the big one.
Come watch.
So, I've been thinking about it and I'm gonna do the right thing.
I'm gonna be responsible.
I mean, I have to.
I'm going to be a father.
Yeah, and on the plus side you walk into a liquor store carrying a baby, man they'll sell you beer.
Yeah, and I like kids.
I still have some of my Legos.
It's gonna be great.
And Jackie's mukatots will get huge.
Fez, for those of us who only speak English, what exactly is a "mukatot"?
Feet.
They will get long as well as wide.
Very gratifying.
You foreign freak.
I mean, this is scary, man.
I might have to get married.
Not just married.
Married to Jackie.
That's freaking terrifying.
- Okay, I am never having sex again.
- Yeah, good one.
No, I'm serious, man.
It's just not worth it.
Just wait, Eric.
This could so easily happen to you.
I don't think so.
I'd probably have to have sex first.
- It's just not fair.
- You're telling me.
I want to have sex.
Laurie, I sure have noticed you hanging around the mailbox a lot.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What could be so important that you'd give up a week of whoring around Fort Lauderdale?
I know.
It's your grades, right?
You're flunking out.
Bingo!
Forman scores!
Right?
Okay, Eric.
You know what?
Dad likes me and he doesn't like you.
Can I help you?
Sure.
Pictures for Forman.
I'll be right back.
Hey, there, Eric.
You okay?
I was just How are you?
Here you go.
Can I help you?
Yup.
Prescription for Pinciotti.
Trying on cologne for Donna?
That is so darn cute.
Thank you, sir.
Here you go.
That'll be $21.50.
That's a little pricey for cough medicine.
Pinciotti, Donna.
Ortho-novum.
Ortho what?
Ortho-novum.
Birth control pills.
Midge!
Midge?
Meet Bob.
He's a typical American who works hard loves his family and has never cheated on his tax return.
Life is good but lately, he's noticed some slight changes in his daughter Donna.
"Hi, honey.
How was school today"?
"Great, Dad.
"I got an A on a test "and tonight I'm having cocktails with the principal.
"Will you excuse us, Dad?
"We have to study".
Bob realizes his daughter is growing up.
Now that Donna's on the pill she's what medical professionals call: Open for business.
Come on, Bob.
I want to show you something.
You see, Bob, the pill means Donna can have lots of sex with many different partners.
Not just Eric.
"Hi, Mr. Pinciotti.
"Boy, is your daughter something"!
So.
Do you get it, Bob?
She's open for business.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm next.
Eric, you're not eating.
Are you sick?
Yeah, Eric, you seem upset.
Did something happen at the pharmacy?
What happened at the pharmacy?
Nothing.
Shut up.
Eric, be nice to your sister.
Kitty, what happened to the mail?
I checked the mail, Dad.
Nothing.
No mail.
You know, the mail keeps disappearing.
I think we have a little mail thief.
Speaking of.
Laurie, I could've sworn I saw a University of Wisconsin envelope sticking out of your bra.
What's that all about?
What?
Donna's on the pill.
What did you do?
Nothing.
Dinner's over!
You.
Kitchen.
Now.
I know you're 17 and we can't stop you from doing what you want to do.
- Yes, we can.
- Red!
All I'm saying is, have respect for her.
You respect her by keeping your hands off of her.
You are a dirty boy, Eric.
Okay, now, let's talk about birth control.
Birth control?
Don't do it!
That's your birth control.
I'm gonna pray for you, Eric.
You're the devil.
And did you know that Laurie's flunking out of college?
Don't change the subject.
You've got strange thoughts in your little head and that Donna's a nice girl.
Red, you are giving him the wrong idea about sex.
- It's not dirty.
- But it's not clean, either.
Okay, cleanliness.
Now, that reminds me, always make sure your nails are trimmed and clean.
Foreplay is very important.
No, it's not.
Yes.
It is.
Personally, I'm very proud to have a daughter who acted so mature and responsible.
I'm her father.
You should've told me, Midge.
Can you imagine how I felt standing there with Eric when the pharmacist handed me birth control pills?
Eric knows?
Thanks a lot, Dad!
- You know, she and Eric are dating.
- All the more reason.
You'd rather she got pregnant?
That is not gonna happen to Donna.
It happened to us.
Sure, throw that in my face again.
Hey, Laurie.
Is Eric around?
No, he's at The Hub.
Watch the door.
- What are you doing?
- My grades.
I gotta make some Fs into Bs before Red sees them.
You're fine.
Red and Kitty are watching Bonanza.
- I gotta go.
- Smart move going on the pill.
That was the best thing I ever did.
Just wait 'til you get to college.
Bye.
Donna!
Guess what?
You're having twins?
No.
I'm not pregnant.
My God.
Jackie, thank God.
My God, I can forget about this whole ugly thing put it behind me, and never ever I am not gonna let you forget about this all right?
You got really lucky.
And as your friend I'm not gonna let you be stupid about this.
We're friends?
Shut up.
Jackie, I went on the pill.
My God you are gonna be so popular!
Jackie, I didn't do it to be popular.
I did it because I am not gonna get stuck in this dinky little town.
Okay, you know they're building a Kmart on Franklin.
Jackie, when this ERA passes, I'm gonna be able to do whatever I want.
And so will you if you don't screw it up now.
So, Donna, tell me more about this pill.
Does it do anything weird to your hair?
Only above your lip.
I still don't understand why Donna has to take this pill.
Is she sick?
No, Fez.
She takes the pill so that she can have all the sex she wants and not get pregnant.
With such a useful product available what the hell were you thinking, you idiot?
Forman, you know what you should do, man?
You should probably break up with Donna.
Because the pressure of that much worryfree sex that could kill you.
Yeah, that would be Plan B, Hyde.
I wish Jackie would've thought about going on the pill.
You know, if I had the chance, I'd do it all different.
No, you wouldn't.
Yeah, you're right, I wouldn't.
I should've broken up with her when I had the chance.
So, Eric, can I talk to you?
Alone.
Sure.
Cool.
Michael I'm not pregnant.
Yes!
Yes!
- So, you feel tons better, right?
- Oh, yeah!
My God, that's so great.
'Cause you know what?
I'm breaking up with you.
What?
Look, Michael, this whole experience has opened my eyes and nothing will stand in the way of my dream of becoming a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.
Did she just break up with me?
Yup.
I am so sad for you.
May I please have her phone number?
My God, Eric.
So your parents know I'm on the pill, too?
Yeah.
I had a nice conversation with Red and Kitty about foreplay.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Eric, I don't want you to think this changes anything between us.
I don't.
But it could right?
I suppose.
I mean, who knows, it might even be you.
Might?
All I'm saying is, we have to wait for the right time.
Okay.
How about now?
- No.
- Okay.
How about now?
- No.
- Okay.
- Now?
- Yes.
Really?
No.
Okay.
Now, right?
I'll be waiting.
Shut up.
I got a birthday coming up so It's for your own good, son.
Okay, who dealt?
I bid three hearts.
I'll go with three spades.
This is fun.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Too slow.
Oh, I see how this game is done.
Now my turn.
Ready?
Yeah.
Too slow.
No, Fez, that's not how the game works.
You're supposed to hit my hands.
Too slow.
Who wants cookies?
Cool.
- Thank you very much.
- They're carob.
Nature's chocolate.
- I think not.
- No.
Come on.
You wouldn't have known if I hadn't told you.
Eric, I picked out a really snazzy outfit for you to wear on Career Day.
That's goody.
Fine, Mr. Grumpy but I can't wait to show off my little man at work.
You know what?
Me neither.
Help me.
Why Career Day, man?
It's so lame.
That's just 'cause your mom's the lunch lady.
Your mom is Gross Edna?
I mean, cool.
You bet it's cool.
That's why I'm spending the day with Hyde and his mom.
Right?
- Eric, I need you in the garage.
- Okay.
Look, I'll be right back.
You can explain exactly what you did to this car.
Okay.
Look, I'll see you tomorrow.
Hold the light steady.
Higher.
Higher.
Not in my eyes!
Do I look like a carburetor?
Not in this light.
That's one.
Sorry.
Eric, you're in high school.
You'd think they'd take and show you how to hold a damned flashlight!
Dad, isn't that what college is for?
That's two.
You wanna go for three?
Give me that.
See, the damn thing is shot.
I need a rebuild kit.
We'll work on this tomorrow.
- Dad, tomorrow's Career Day.
- Yeah, I'm working half-days.
I'll be home by noon.
I think I'm gonna go to the hospital with mom.
Yeah, what for?
It's Career Day, not Career Half-Day.
Okay, look, that's not three, that's what my teacher said Fine, Eric.
I'll fix the car and you go with your mom and see if you want to be a nurse.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Okay, so, now, this is my ward.
I have to check with the night nurse.
You say hi to the girls.
Hi, girls.
Hi.
You must be Eric.
I recognize you from all the pictures.
Your face has cleared up real nice.
Thanks for noticing that.
You know, your mom does the work of five nurses.
This place would fall apart without her.
- And she's so funny!
- Yeah, she is.
Wait, no, she's not.
Oh, yeah.
And she draws these funny cartoons.
See?
Now, I warn you, it's a little racy, but Oh, honey, you don't need to see that.
It's just, a certain body part has been shoved up another body part for comic effect.
So have you met everybody?
Nurse Forman, I just talked to the lab.
Why didn't you bring down that blood sample?
Because you didn't give it to me?
I most certainly did.
Next time I have something to give you, you tell me.
Will do.
What is his problem?
Well, you all know my theory.
- Edna.
- Steven.
Fez, this is, my mom.
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Gross Edna.
No, honey.
It's Miss Gross Edna.
You see, Mr. Gross Edna ran off with Miss Perfect Ass.
But she can laugh about it now.
Yes, she can.
Shut up.
I am so excited to be in the food service industry.
May I cut the cheese?
Is he kidding?
We can never tell.
Knock yourself out.
But if you cut off a finger, you're out of here.
Steven, you can start by slicing pizza.
No.
I'm here as an observer.
A fly on the wall.
One of many.
What a surprise.
Lazy, just like your father.
No, actually, I'm lazy in a way that's entirely my own.
You two are hilarious.
- Here, put these on.
- I'm not wearing these.
Crap, sorry, don't blame me.
It's the stupid Those health codes.
May I keep these?
Sure, baby.
This is so cool.
My dad's office.
Dad's desk.
Dad's phone, ding-ding.
My dad.
Yeah, I love this.
Yeah, Michael, this is where all the magic happens.
Okay, let's get started.
Question number one: "What's your job"?
I'm a senior executive, statistical analysis technician.
- You're a senior execu-what?
- In plain English I concatenate diverse statistical information to maximize the potential utilization of data.
So you give people data?
You know, a lot of people think that.
No.
My job's not about output, it's about throughput.
So you throughput data?
Now you've lost me, son.
Listen, Michael you know the eight-tracks you love so much?
You make them?
No.
But because of us, other people who make them are able to make them better.
So you fix stuff?
You could say that.
But I wouldn't.
You picked a good day to do this, Donna.
We're starting a three-day promotional sale.
You'll finally get to see why they call me Bargain Bob.
Yeah, Dad, 'cause that's been a real stumper.
You're such a cutie.
You keep your eyes peeled and your pencil sharp because you're gonna learn how a serious businessman operates.
Good, the clowns are here.
Hello, Mr. Forman, what are you doing home?
That's right, you're only working part-time.
If it makes you feel any better, my dad feels really, really sorry for you.
Aren't you supposed to be at Career Day?
No, I'm a sophomore.
I'm surprised you didn't know that about me.
Right.
My mistake.
Listen, while you're here, why don't you hold this flashlight on that carburetor there.
Like this?
My God.
One of you is not useless.
A world of careers is waiting for you.
Talk to your guidance counselor today.
These people are ready for the jobs of tomorrow.
Are you?
Good morning!
This is my son.
He's making my rounds with me.
You let me know if this gets to be too much for you.
Okay, Mom, I think that I can handle it Good God!
What is that?
Remember this the next time you want a skateboard.
I have some bad news.
Oh.
I have some good news.
Okay, now push!
Ma'am, you're hurting me.
You don't know what pain is!
Okay.
All right.
This is the performance index before my involvement.
And this is after.
Okay.
So, you're responsible for this.
You can't credit me with that.
That's probably a statistical anomaly.
But you made the chart, right?
I wish.
So do I. Okay, question number three: "Was the food service industry your first career choice"?
Heck, no, Fez.
I always wanted to go into show biz.
In fact, I was in the Tommy Bartlett water show at the Wisconsin Dells.
Yes, women waterskiing in bikinis.
Very erotic.
Anyway I was the top girl on the pyramid when they fired me for getting knocked up.
Let me finish this one for you, Edna.
Fez, this is the story where I ruin my mother's fabulous water skiing career.
Yeah, you did.
They said a pregnant girl on water skis would make the audience nervous.
Not to mention, you were probably hideously fat.
No.
I looked great.
I kept my weight down by smoking.
See, that's that maternal instinct kicking in again.
Yeah, you're damn right I'm maternal.
- I raised you alone.
- Alone?
Hardly.
There was "uncle" Chet, and "uncle" Larry and yeah, "uncle" hot tub Johnny.
I suppose I should've just become a nun when your father walked out on me.
Hell, he must've been crazy to leave all this.
Always a smart ass, Steven.
Just like your father.
You know what?
One thing he did do right: He left!
All right.
That's right, Steven, just walk.
Just like everyone else.
Okay, question number four: "Would you say you are a people person"?
Come on, Jackie!
Harder!
Come on, give it all you got.
- Yeah!
- My God, I did it!
I did it!
I'm changing a tire!
I feel like Nancy Drew.
A girl needs to know what to do in an emergency.
You know, I'm surprised your father hasn't taught you this already.
Yeah Daddy works really hard, so he doesn't spend a lot of time with me.
But he did promise me a Mustang for my birthday.
So I love him.
You know, Jackie, I've been a father a long time so trust me when I tell you this.
The Mustang's front end is problematic.
Get yourself a Firebird.
All right, let's start Mr. Harris on a full course of penicillin.
Doctor, you might want to consider erythromycin.
And why would I want to do that, nurse?
It's just that, Mr. Harris is allergic to penicillin and I thought erythromycin might make him a touch less dead.
I know that when I go to the hospital, I like to not die.
Okay do you have customers?
No, they're more like clients.
- But you have clients?
- Sort of.
And you provide them a product?
It's more like a service.
A service?
Not To maximize the potential utilization of the data?
If we did that, we'd go out of business.
Red.
Forman around?
No, he's with his mom for Career Day.
Which is where you're supposed to be.
What's the deal?
Man.
Edna's riding me again about being just like my dad.
So I just took off.
Didn't your dad take off?
Irony.
Far out.
Look, you and your mom have a bad history.
And neither of you can nurture the other's self esteem because you've both been damaged by past criticism and shame.
Are you okay?
I'm working half-days, so I watch a lot of Donahue.
Okay, I'm not sure, but I think I found the u-joint.
- God bless you, Jackie.
- Okay, I'm going back in.
Could someone help me get Mr. Anderson on the gurney, please?
I'll give you a hand, Mom.
Okay.
So, what's wrong with him?
- He's dead.
- Oh, my What?
Didn't we just see this guy a half an hour ago?
Honey, he was dead then.
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
I'm so sorry you didn't get a chance to meet him.
Wait, Mr. Anderson?
Isn't this the guy you always talked about at dinner?
The guy whose daughter just got married?
Yeah, he just showed me the pictures.
It was a beautiful wedding.
I'm gonna miss him.
So, okay, you grab that end, and let's get moving.
We have to serve dinner in 20 minutes.
And then we look at the chi square here apply the standard deviation here and correlate the results with the actualization median here.
And that's what I do.
And I can't make it any clearer than that.
I'm just gonna say you're a farmer.
Okay, next question: "What has this job taught you"?
One thing I've learned: Midgets make money.
I don't know why, but people see a midget, they wanna buy a blender.
I guess it reminds them that life is short.
Write.
Marketing is important.
Know your customer.
That's not what I said.
None of this is what I said.
Sure it is, Dad.
I mean, I just cleaned up the language a bit to make you sound more dignified.
Dignified?
What are you saying?
You're embarrassed by me?
What have I ever done that's embarrassing?
Just look around.
All right.
Let me tell you what I see.
You see clowns, I see your tuition at Harvard.
You see your dad as a ringmaster, I see you going to grad school.
You see a chimpanzee in a tutu.
Okay, that just makes me laugh.
The chimp is cute.
The point is, Donna, you're capable of great things.
And if this is what I have to do so you can achieve them then that's what I'll do.
Dad.
I feel really bad.
Nobody feels really bad around Bargain Bob!
Unless you got bit by a monkey.
Bad, bad, blood, blood is taking you for a ride the only good thing about bad blood is letting it slide Mom, how do you do this every day?
You're running around and people are sick and dying I mean, poor Mr. Anderson.
Look, you knew this guy, Mom.
How do you deal with all this?
Here we go now.
- Bad - Bad - Blood - Blood The bitch is in her smile The lie is on her lips Such an evil child What are you doing?
Throwing out the disgusting used meat.
No, sweetie, you've gotta toss that in the chili bucket.
The chili bucket?
- I thought that was the garbage.
- No.
Have you thrown a lot in there?
Some.
Most things just break down in there.
It'll be fine.
- Hi.
- Steven, you came back.
You don't know what that means to me.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Honey, could you clean up those pizza trays?
I'm gonna skip out early.
Guess what I did in the chili bucket?
Go ahead, guess.
Steven, I'm sorry.
I'm not being a very good mom, am I?
No.
All right, I've got a better idea.
Let's do something together.
Come on, I'll buy you a beer.
A beer?
- Yeah, that actually sounds good.
- You got your fake ID?
- You know it.
- That's my boy.
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, whoa.
"Autumn is harvest time for the farmer.
"At dawn, my dad and I were out in the field "picking carrots fresh off the trees".
Kelso, carrots don't That's good.
You should put that down.
So, what do you guys want to do when you graduate?
Not touch dead people, ever.
I want to go back to my homeland with all that knowledge I have learned in Wisconsin and rule with an iron fist.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Jackie.
- Hi, Eric.
How was Career Day?
- It was good.
I learned a lot.
Good.
Now you're going to learn something else.
Jackie's gonna teach you how to hold a flashlight.
Jackie?
Yeah, I finally found one of your friends I like.
Jackie isn't really one of my friends.
That's one.
That's how you do that.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
My first prom tux.
Come on, guys, dig the crushed velvet.
Eric, you look like a pimp.
You know, Forman prom night could be a very special night for you and Donna.
Hyde, this could be the biggest night of our lives.
- I mean, Donna and I could go - To the prom.
- No, Fez.
All the way.
- All the way to the prom.
You know what you should do?
You should rent a motel room.
Yeah, that's spontaneous.
What?
Look, if this night is as big as I think, I want it to be very, very special.
Because this is gonna be the first time for both of us.
You silly virgins.
Anyway, this is how I picture it.
Well, here we are walking on the beach.
And now we're gonna do it.
Yes.
Isn't it spontaneous?
Exactly.
That's what got me.
That was nice.
But if I plan it out, it won't be nice.
It'll be - Good evening.
- Did you bring the forms?
Yes, I did.
Here's the guarantee of foreplay.
Signed, initialed, notarized.
Very well.
As you know, I'm on the pill so here is your copy of the prophylactic waiver.
It looks like we have a deal here.
I'm looking forward to consummation.
- Excellent.
- Thank you.
Forman, if you don't get a motel, it's gonna be more like this.
You're home already?
It's not even Kitty, he's home already.
Already?
Eric, you're just such a loser.
He is, isn't he?
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Are you ready to rock and roll?
Kitty, I am so mad at Bob.
I'm trying to improve myself, and he won't let me.
Plus, he says my ideas are stupid.
Now that's the pot calling the kettle black, isn't it?
I'll say.
What?
Good coffee.
You know, I'm sorry, Midge.
But I really have to get to work.
Gosh, darn it, I want a job.
You know, Midge, having a job is not all it's cracked up to be.
Working at the hospital is very hard work.
But I don't want one of those jobs.
I want a fun job.
Okay, even with a fun job, you still You have to deal with your boss.
You're right.
I'll get a job as a boss.
Now, that is a sharp plan, Midge.
You just You let me know how that goes.
Okay, guys.
Guess who's taking Pam Macy to the prom?
Anyone with a quarter?
Me.
Damn, and I had a quarter.
- Kelso, you're not taking Jackie?
- No way, man.
Jackie dumped me.
- I can take Jackie.
- Yeah, do it, Fez, and I'll kick your ass.
Well, well, well.
Look who suddenly cares.
Why did you hit me?
That was sarcasm.
You know, you guys are making me sick with all your prom talk.
Proms are stupid.
What would you know?
You've never even been to one.
I haven't been to the dentist, either, but I don't need to go to know it's lame.
I know who I can ask to the prom.
Oh, boy, who, Fez?
The lucky lady is my English teacher.
Fez, you can't take a teacher to the prom.
Why not?
She's always writing sexy comments on my homework.
See.
"Nice job.
Good effort.
"See me.
"I love you".
Okay, I made the last one up but the other ones were real.
These are the shoes I'm wearing to the prom.
- Aren't they cool?
- My God.
I was gonna get new shoes except Michael didn't ask me.
And you like my prom dress, right?
My God.
I was gonna get a new prom dress except Michael didn't ask me.
I'm so nervous about the prom.
I think it's gonna be the night that Eric and I You know?
My gosh, that's when Michael and I were going to do it for the first time.
Jackie, you and Kelso did it, like, two months ago.
And, like, 30 times after that.
Yeah, but it would have been our first time at a prom.
Except Michael didn't ask me.
Jackie, you broke up with him.
I know.
Isn't it sad?
- Look, just ask Kelso to go with you.
- God, no.
This is the prom.
This is no time for your stupid feminist crap.
Hello, Michael.
Hello, Jackie.
I'm just over here helping Donna get ready for the prom.
Because Eric and Donna are going to the prom.
Yes, we are.
I'm going to the prom.
I'm taking Pam Macy.
Oh, the thing.
I have a date, too.
Who is it?
What's his name?
His name is not important.
What's important is, he's better than you in every conceivable way.
Damn, Jackie, that could be anybody!
Jackie if I asked you what's wrong, will you stop doing that?
It's the prom.
Stupid Michael's taking stupid Pam Macy.
And I don't have a date, but I told him I did, and I'm a complete loser.
No, you're not.
It's just that, like, I thought he was gonna ask me and now everyone who's anyone is already going.
That is so true.
How would you know?
You're not even going.
You're not even going.
And I bet you clean up real good.
Well, I do, but I won't.
See, that's a big part of who I am.
Look, I know we've had our differences, but Jackie, we've had nothing but differences.
In fact, don't we kind of hate each other?
Yes, but this is the prom.
Jackie, stop.
Stop crying.
Stop it.
- Look, do you want to go to the prom?
- Yes.
The gym looks like Well, the gym with streamers.
But it's nice.
Yeah.
You know, this is just gonna be an incredible night.
Really incredible.
Wait.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
- Nothing.
- Okay, then me neither.
Hey, guys.
Pam, this is Eric and Donna.
We have biology class together.
Biology?
Yeah.
See, Pam doesn't like to talk about school.
- Are you guys having fun?
- No.
I have to go to the bathroom.
My God, Kelso, you'd rather be with her than Jackie?
- I love her!
- No, you don't.
Okay, I don't.
See, but Jackie's gonna be really jealous.
Good evening, kids.
So, is everyone having fun?
Why, yes, we are, Ms. Kaminsky.
There you are, Diane.
I've been looking all over for you.
Shall we dance?
I am not going to dance with you, Fez.
Isn't she adorable?
They're all gonna laugh at you!
Shut up, Ma, you're making the night too damn special.
You look beautiful.
My God.
So do you.
Do you want me to go inside and meet your No.
Trust me, she's lovely.
Let's just go, all right?
Is that for me?
Yeah.
Here, I got this for you.
God, Steven, this is beautiful.
This whole experience has taught me that I don't need Michael to go to the prom.
I can go with anyone.
Even you.
Thanks.
Okay, let's not do that.
Sorry.
I have my dad's Lincoln.
Will you drive?
Yeah.
He's got insurance, right?
Wait, I don't care.
Let's go.
I've decided what kind of business I'm going to open.
What's the one thing people can't live without?
Oxygen.
No.
No.
That's true.
But that's not what I'm selling.
So keep guessing.
Lemonade?
Give up?
I'm about to.
Greeting cards.
Good wine.
This is such a great night.
Yeah.
It's too bad our parents aren't out of town.
So we'd have someplace to go.
For after.
Yeah.
Like, a motel room?
Yeah.
That would've been great.
Really?
'Cause I got one.
Did you plan on telling me?
No.
It's better that you didn't.
'Cause then it wouldn't have been spontaneous.
You are so the girl for me.
Let's go.
Okay.
Why so glum, Fez?
Mrs. Clark, you may be good at teaching the music but you cannot help me in the ways of love.
Fez, has someone got you down?
So far down, Mrs. Clark.
Here's a little ditty I've been working on.
Maybe it'll help.
Hit it.
Midge, you don't know the first thing about having a business.
- But there's no risk, Bob.
- Why not?
Because it's your money!
Kitty, don't you think I should have my own card shop?
Midgie, hold on.
- I think I have a dynamite solution.
- Really?
Yeah.
'Cause I love you.
So, I want you to have another baby and stop bugging me.
Oh, Bob.
No.
So, how much this whole setup gonna cost you, Bob?
Plenty.
But I figure it'll be cheaper than a divorce.
We'll see.
And here we are.
This is so romantic.
It's Forman and Donna.
And they're gonna do it!
Forman!
Forman!
Yeah.
You know what?
Those guys are just jerks.
I forgot about them already.
Hang on.
Big stain.
- I'm just gonna go grab a towel.
- Okay.
Good God!
They say they're more scared of you than you are of them.
Right, so?
You know, Donna, I've thought about this moment like, a thousand times.
Me, too.
One, two, three.
All right.
When you thought about this moment, was it like this?
Not really.
You know, I was having a pretty good time at prom.
Me, too.
Let's get out of here.
Okay.
Donna, what if this is our only chance?
It won't be.
Okay.
It's just that I always pictured Michael and I together at the prom.
That's the way it was supposed to be, you know?
Yeah, I know.
Well Pam's butt looks really big in that dress.
No, it doesn't.
Yeah, no, it doesn't.
But thank you.
Do you mind if we just sit down?
Yeah, okay.
I'll go grab some punch.
Hyde, you brought Jackie to the prom?
You're supposed to be my friend and you dogged me.
She cried, man.
Is she having a good time?
'Cause she looks real pretty.
All right, look, you big baby.
She wants to be with you, and you want to be with her.
So, why don't you stop whining about it and just go be with each other.
'Cause the whole thing sickens me.
But what am I gonna do with Pam?
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of Pam.
Excuse me, Pam.
Hi.
Have you ever seen the backseat of a Lincoln Continental?
Lots of times.
Would you like to see another one?
- Sure.
- That's great.
Let's go.
Jackie.
Michael.
You look beautiful.
You look really handsome.
I miss you.
I miss you, too.
Eric, please may I have your motel room key, please?
Fez, I'm not going to a motel with you.
Yes, and you also said you would not dance with me.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I am so excited about Star Whores.
Fezzie, man, it's Star Wars.
Screw that.
Hey, Forman, man, this thing better be good.
If I don't see some space jugs, I'm gonna be super-pissed.
I don't know, guys.
I hear it's okay.
There's no way it's better than The Planet of the Apes.
I mean, those apes were really good actors.
Whoa!
Then they go into this bar and there are all these space creatures then, someone makes the mistake of picking on Obi-Wan Kenobi.
And then, he takes out his lightsaber and he goes "whoosh" and he chops this guy's arm right off, 'cause it's a saber that's made out of light.
You know, this doesn't sound like a nice movie.
Now, The Way We Were, that's a nice movie.
So, Eric, you gonna get yourself some Star Wars pajamas now?
Kitty, I'm going back to work, full-time.
My God, you're kidding.
No, I ran into Ron Milbank at the K-Mart and he's moved back to re-open the plant.
This is a godsend.
And to think how close we came to losing the house.
Losing the Mom, you said we were fine.
Eric, honey, I lied.
- Honey, this is the best news.
- I'm so glad that you're happy.
- Hey, way to go, Daddy.
- My job and my little girl.
Okay, so, I'm here, too, Dad.
Speaking of you I told Milbank's son David to come by to see you.
- David Milbank?
Dad, I hated that guy.
- Yeah, I hate his dad but I smile like hell whenever I see him.
And you'll do the same.
Got it?
Got it.
David Milbank?
Oh, barf.
Eric, remember when you beat him up on the playground?
Yep.
I kicked his ass.
Wait, wasn't he the kid with scoliosis and asthma?
Yep.
And I kicked his ass.
So, Jackie, you want to go see Star Wars tonight?
Michael, I told you, I don't like space.
Jackie, if we're gonna start our relationship over you gotta meet me halfway, honey.
Well, maybe I want to do something else tonight.
Like what?
God, Jackie.
We can do that for the rest of our lives!
Star Wars is a limited engagement.
Fine.
But I want the big popcorn.
They finally left.
Now it's just the three of us.
That's great, Fez.
I get it.
If I was gone, you two would kiss.
Life's a bitch, huh?
Eric!
David's here.
The scoliosis asthma freak is here?
I cannot wait to see this.
- Hey, guys.
I'm back.
- Yeah, hey.
Wow, David.
You've really grown up.
Me?
Look at you.
You have really grown up.
Yes.
In fact, we've all grown up.
Yes, but him much more than you have.
So, David, tell us about you.
We're dating.
What was that?
What?
I'm just Sorry, making conversation here.
So, Donna, you still writing short stories?
- Yeah, I still write a little.
- Not every You still write?
- I mean, I would love to read your stuff.
- Yeah?
Well, enough about us.
Tell us about you.
David, you still got that big old curve in your spine?
Can I see it?
Hi, Kelso.
Laurie.
I'm bored.
If you're bored, you should go see Star Wars.
No, I was thinking of doing something else and Laurie, what's going on?
You're acting like you're liking me and that's weird.
It's like I told you, Kelso.
I'm bored.
That's very flattering.
But you know, Jackie and I are back together.
I understand.
Do you want to see my appendix scar?
Once again what's-her-name and I are back together.
- It's not my best story, but it's - Wow!
I love it.
Do you have any more?
Yeah, my God, yeah, I totally have more.
I just My God!
My God, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
That's all right.
I'm so sorry about that.
What the hell's going on here?
I spilled soda on him.
I should leave.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
Hey, Donna, great writing.
- What is it with you?
- Me?
Donna, he's hitting on you.
He is not.
We're just friends.
He talks to me, listens to me, shares ideas with me.
My God, Donna, you are so naive.
Eric, just because a guy pays attention to me does not mean he wants to get me naked.
Grow up!
- Is that why you paid attention to me?
- Of course!
Not.
Of course not.
I love your mind.
That's the thing I love.
So, Donna says David and her are just good friends and if I don't believe that then she's gonna think that I don't trust her.
Eric, maybe you should let David have Donna.
I mean, they look so nice together.
You see, this is why your country lost the war.
My country never fought a war.
Yeah, big surprise.
You know, Forman, I'm a romantic.
So I say you choke him till his eyes pop out.
Yeah.
Hitting people is cool.
I don't know.
If I hit this guy, Donna's just gonna be pissed.
No, man.
Chicks dig that stuff.
I mean, Leia, right, she acted like she was mad at Han but I could tell she liked him.
Kelso, man, what are you, an idiot?
Leia likes Luke.
I mean, she kissed him on that bridge.
Just for luck!
Guys, I have a real problem here.
I got it.
Maybe you should let David have Donna because, I mean, they look so nice together.
Now remember, a Jedi is his own master.
His own master.
His own master.
A Jedi's power lies within his own Are you even listening to me?
What?
Yes.
You were saying: "May the force be with me".
No, I did not.
Jedi Knight.
Jedi dumbass.
Luke, man I don't mean to bum you out but I just saw Princess Leia cruise around with Darth Vader in his tie-fighter.
Right, Chewie?
Man, this totally sucks!
I should be Han.
Quit whining.
Will somebody get that?
You know what?
Why don't I just get it myself?
Honey, it's Darth Vader.
Thanks, Mom.
Oh, my God you guys just gotta come over to the dark side.
They have free food.
All right, what have you done with Princess Leia?
Hey, guys.
Leia, what are you doing with Darth Vader?
We're just friends, Luke.
- He's nice.
I think you'd really like him.
- No, I wouldn't!
Give me a chance, Luke.
Look.
Hello?
He's choking me with his mind, here.
That's, like, yeah, evil.
While Michael and I were apart, he realized how much he missed me.
I'm telling you, Donna breaking up with him was the best thing I ever did.
I thought you said that getting a pedicure was the best thing you ever did.
That was last week, Donna.
I don't know.
I don't know what to do about Eric.
He's acting like this possessive, macho jerk.
I am so happy for you, Donna!
No, Jackie, I'm with him because I thought he wasn't like that.
Mrs. Pinciotti, can you tell Donna I'm right?
Isn't it cool when men act like they own you?
Yeah.
Mom, what about all those feminist classes you took?
Right.
No.
- Hey, Mr. Pinciotti.
Hey, Dad.
- Hey, there, Eric.
Dad I was wondering if you could show me, like, a few fighting moves.
- Who are you planning to fight?
- David Milbank.
David Milbank?
He's got scoliosis and asthma.
You could take him.
Come on, now, Eric.
Why don't you beat up Kelso?
I don't work for his dad.
- He's making a move on Donna.
- No.
Donna's not going near that pretzel boy.
No.
You've got to nip this in the bud, Eric.
All right.
The bridge of the nose is very vulnerable.
And hit him with a banjo.
A banjo, Bob?
What?
I'm helping.
Where is he gonna get a banjo?
I don't know.
But I saw a guy get hit with a banjo once, and he went down.
Hitting a guy with a banjo is dirty.
You wanna knee him in the groin.
You can hit him in the groin with a banjo.
So, what do you want to do tonight?
And if you say, "see Star Wars again," I'm leaving.
You don't want to leave.
You want to see Star Wars.
Stop it!
I have had it with you.
You are weird and I'm going home!
Jackie Boy, that's terrible the way she treats you.
Right?
You know, I saw Star Wars and I'm not a movie expert, but I think it's safe to say it was the greatest film of all time.
Finally someone who understands!
Yeah.
You know, Kelso, I always thought you were kind of dumb.
But I don't care.
You know, I don't either.
Where's Eric?
I don't know.
I think you do know, Red.
All right, Kitty.
Some kid's been hitting on Donna so he went to fight him.
But it's no big deal.
No big deal.
You men are such Neanderthals!
Fighting over a woman.
It's ridiculous.
It's like that time at that beach when that lifeguard pinched my fanny.
You just had to lay him out, didn't you?
Well, yeah.
How do you think I felt, Red?
Watching you stand over that poor man your eyes burning with intensity your suntanned muscles gleaming like a bronzed god.
Okay, you and me, right now.
Eric, what are you doing?
This isn't about you, Donna.
Eric, stop it.
Yeah, that's right.
Hold me back.
Stop it!
Eric, for the last time David has no interest in me whatsoever!
Yeah, I do.
What?
Why do you think we've been spending so much time together?
- 'Cause we're friends?
- Come on, Donna.
I mean, I've talked to you I've listened to you, I've shared ideas with you.
What's that about?
- I had the exact same problem with - What?
I don't know what it takes with women.
I mean, you put in all this time and effort, and they wanna be just friends.
I know.
I hate that.
Man, and to think I was going to kick your ass.
You had every reason.
You hear that, Donna?
"Every reason".
You know what, Eric?
You don't trust me and you don't respect me.
No, Donna, I was just trying to Get away from me!
It wouldn't have worked out with her and me anyway.
I mean, I'm not supposed to say anything but we're just here until my dad closes down the plant.
Wait.
Closes?
Your dad was opening the plant full-time.
Yeah, they're burning off the inventory and then, that's all she wrote.
My dad's depending on that job.
Yeah, I guess he should have thought ahead like my dad.
You bastard!
You broke my nose!
Good!
You'll pay for this, Forman!
Before I leave, Donna will be mine!
Dad.
- Hey, Dad, can I talk to you?
- Absolutely.
Eric, I am very disappointed in you for fighting.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
See you in the car.
Where are you guys going?
Taking your mother out for dinner and a movie.
A little celebration.
You know, son, sometimes life gives you a good bounce.
So, what'd you want to talk about?
Have a good time.
Yeah.
Hey, little brother, I made out with Kelso.
Shut up!
- What is wrong with you?
- Everything's wrong.
Donna's mad at me and the plant's closing, Dad's out of a job.
Oh, wow.
Guess this is a bad time to tell him I flunked out of college.
You know what, Laurie?
I cannot believe that you're the favorite.
Yeah, doesn't it kick ass?
That Vader's got him.
There's no way out of this.
Is this a true story?
Yeah.
That voice.
James Earl Jones!
Eric actually liked this?
That kid's on dope.
Whoa.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, my God.
From up here, Point Place looks just like Paris.
You think that looks like Paris?
God, no wonder you think Kelso could be a model.
Whoa, I could so be a model.
Come on, man.
Shut up and just keep painting.
It's done!
Gentlemen, we have finally done it.
A pot leaf on the water tower.
This is the proudest moment of my life.
It doesn't look like a pot leaf.
What?
It looks like a hand giving the finger.
It doesn't have to look perfect, Hyde.
It's art.
Get up and make it better.
Fine.
Just, yeah, make it wider right up there.
Yeah, out further, though.
Yeah.
Right up there My God!
Michael!
Kelso!
Yeah?
How's it look from down there?
It looks like it's giving me the finger.
You guys, this is so stupid.
We should just take him to the hospital.
No, Jackie, then my dad will find out.
Shut up.
My mom's a nurse.
I'll wake her up.
Maybe she can fix him.
- Don't wake up Red though, he'll kill us all.
- Gee, you think?
Red.
Kitty.
Okay, let's go.
Everybody hop in the car and let's go now.
Where's your mom?
Shut up.
Don't you dare talk about my mother!
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
No.
Dad.
No, there is no way this could've been avoided.
Yes.
No.
Yeah, the cow kicked me after I tipped it over.
I'm not lying!
Okay, all right, I love you, too.
He bought it.
Excuse me, yes.
My friend and I would like our sponge baths now, please.
- Eric, are you all right?
- They were sleeping!
Michael, as God is my witness, I will nurse you back to health.
Thanks, Jackie.
I'm in a lot of pain.
My poor baby.
All right.
That's it.
I'm going.
Whoever wants a ride?
Hey, sorry about tonight, you guys.
Sorry?
Why?
We got to watch you fall, man.
I had a blast!
See you, Kelso.
Hyde is such a jerk.
This is all his fault.
What are you talking about?
Who said the pot leaf wasn't good enough?
Hyde did.
And who said you should lean out further?
Hyde did.
So, who made you fall off the water tower?
No, wait, Jackie, that's crazy.
Hyde's like my best friend.
No.
Brian Piccolo and Gayle Sayers were best friends.
Brian's Song.
I love that movie.
See, Michael, Gayle held Brian's hand and cried and gave him sips of cool water in his hospital bed.
Yeah.
So where are you now?
In a hospital bed.
And where's Hyde?
He isn't giving me sips of cool water, that's for sure!
Well, we got vandals in this town.
I was driving home and I saw the water tower giving me the finger.
Vandals you say?
Where were you last night, Eric?
Can it, Laurie.
Eric, you look pale.
Let me see your eyes.
Look at me.
Do you have a fever?
I know what you need.
Right after breakfast, I want you to mow the lawn.
The fresh air will do you good.
Eric, is something bothering you?
God, make it stop!
Kitty.
Kitty.
Kitty.
Kitty.
Red.
Kitty.
Red.
Well, okay, now so far Eric is nine out of ten.
He's got bloodshot eyes, mood swings irregular appetite, odd sleeping patterns.
Red, our Johnny is high.
Kitty, that's nonsense.
He's not on drugs he's just weird.
Morning.
Hungry?
I overslept.
I'm late for school.
It's Bye.
That kid's on dope.
I'll say.
It's Sunday.
Boy, these after school specials are thrilling.
I mean, who knew it takes only one beer to turn a cheerleader into a whore?
You know, Fez, this show contains an important message.
That very thing happened to a good friend of mine.
Really?
May I ask who?
Man, that is one drunk, slutty cheerleader.
- There go her pom poms.
- All right, that is quite enough!
Everywhere I look now it's sex, sex, sex.
It's disgusting and I, for one, will not have it in my basement!
Eric, what's wrong with you?
Well, excuse me, Donna, for having a little moral fiber.
I'm going to go check on Michael.
Yeah, how's he doing?
Yeah, like you care.
Why don't you just apologize?
Apologize for what?
If you don't know then obviously, you're a big, fat jerk.
Okay, she's nuts.
I know.
You are not fat.
- Eric.
- Get off of my mom.
What?
What is it with you?
You've been extra losery lately.
I saw Mom and Dad having sex.
You poor thing.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Baby's fine.
Laurie, it was horrible.
And I can't get the image out of my mind.
I mean, it was Mom and Dad, but they were They were like a pair of wildebeests on a National Geographic Special.
Deep in the unexplored psyche of a confused young man is a wilderness called wild Wisconsin.
After several days of tracking we've finally located the den of the wily Red.
Here we see Suburbus Sexmaniacus tracking his prey through the living room.
Observe as the male indicates his interest in mating by making loud, aggressive noises.
The female's attractive double knit pantsuit and scarlet lips signal her readiness.
This display is not lost on the male.
Here he goes.
Let's watch.
Eric, I am so sorry.
But you have to understand.
Mom and Dad are in love.
- They have urges and needs just like us.
- No urges.
No needs.
I learned in psychology class that what you went through is traumatic.
But don't worry.
Many people have had this same experience.
Really?
And they turned out all right?
Well, some of them turned out to be serial killers.
But I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
But whatever.
You know what the sad thing is?
I actually think you're trying to be nice.
Yeah.
It's just not my strong suit.
Sorry.
So, I'll be all right?
No.
Donna, I'm really not in the mood.
Come on.
I'm just trying to get a little action here.
Donna, I just can't.
Come on, all the other guys are doing it.
What's going on?
Are you, like, mad at me or something?
I Donna, I saw my parents having sex.
God!
Yee!
Yeah.
And you liked it, right?
No!
God, no!
That's sick!
Everyone's sick!
I'm kidding, Eric, I'm kidding.
Good one.
All right, look.
I'm gonna tell you something I've never told anybody else all right?
When I was 12, I saw my parents doing it.
How did you get over it?
At first I was, like, completely freaked out.
But then, eventually, the pain receded and I was able to live again.
I don't see this receding.
I mean, I walked in on Red and Kitty and they were They were right in the middle.
God, that's nothing.
I caught my parents outside, in broad daylight, on my hammock.
Where I used to read, like, my Nancy Drew mysteries.
That is so much worse than mine.
Oh, God.
I can remember, like, little bits of naked skin peeking through the holes of the hammock.
Wow.
It's weird, but knowing what you went through just makes me feel so much better.
- Because you're, like, totally over it, right?
- And later they came inside and they had, like, this checkerboard pattern all over their arms and legs.
And my dad laughed and said they fell asleep on the hammock.
But I knew it was a lie.
I knew what he did to my mom.
Your mom.
- Okay, I'm ready to fool around.
- Please take me home.
Look, Jackie, it's my friends.
Eric, Donna, and Fez.
Yep, that's all my friends.
Kelso, if you have something to say to me, why don't you just say it?
No.
No.
I think you have something to say to me.
And I'm gonna be right over here when you're ready.
All right, this is stupid.
- Hyde, just apologize already.
- Forman, it's not my fault.
Whatever, he thinks it is.
It is.
You made me fall off the water tower.
How?
Did I push you?
- Well, no, but - Did I make the railing slippery?
- No.
- Then how is it my fault?
Because you didn't like my artwork.
And you don't respect me, and you laugh at me and you're inconsiderate of my feelings.
Kelso, no offense, but you sound like a chick.
What Man, I do!
Okay, all right.
Do you remember that time when I was climbing your fence and I hit my forehead on that tree branch, and I fell into your yard and your dog Yogi came out of the house and bit me twice on the ass?
Yeah.
You bled and you cried.
- I bled, I didn't cry.
- Yeah, you did.
You bled and you cried.
And you laughed, man.
A lot.
While I was bleeding.
- Do you see my point?
- Yeah.
It's funny when friends get hurt.
Close enough.
- Sorry.
- Hey, stop talking like a chick.
God, you're both idiots.
Eric.
Your father and I have noticed that you've been acting very strange lately.
Like a hippie.
- Is there something you want to tell us?
- Are you on dope?
Are you?
Because we can help you get clean.
- There's counseling, hospitalization - My foot kicking your ass.
Mom, Dad, I'm not on drugs.
What a relief.
You have no idea Kitty, he's lying.
That's what the hopheads do.
Dad, I swear, I'm not on drugs.
Then, what the hell's wrong with you?
I accidentally I was upstairs and I Okay, you know what, I'm on drugs.
For God's sake, he saw you guys doing it!
There.
I helped.
Honey.
- Were your father and I having intercourse?
- Mom.
No wonder you've been acting so weird.
Red, say something.
Make him feel better.
It's more fun than it looks.
- Red.
- What?
What do you want me to say?
Look, you know what?
You guys do it.
And I'm okay with that.
So thanks.
Sure thing.
I just hope you learned your lesson.
Yes, sir.
I did.
Wait a second.
What lesson?
Always knock.
- Even in the middle of the afternoon.
- Oh, my God.
Damn, that was funny.
I don't know how funny it is.
I mean, what if that had been you walking in on your parents.
And your mother was a dancer.
I imagine that would have been quite something.
Quit it, Kitty.
Hey, don't.
Now, stop it.
Boy, Kelso is going to be so happy that I finished his graffiti.
Yes.
I am very talented.
I No.
I am hurt.
And all alone.
And it is giving me the finger.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
What are you doing?
Nothing.
How's it going back there?
Okay, Donna, just for that, I'm not taking your bra off.
You weren't taking it off anyway.
Hello, House of Chicken?
How big are your wings?
Breasts.
How big are your breasts?
This is Fez, who is this?
My first prank call.
Every night with you is an adventure.
Yeah, Fez, it's a real roller coaster, ain't it?
Hyde, how come you do not have a girlfriend?
Maybe if you did something with your hair.
Hey, you, is there a motel in this pukehole?
There's a Sleepy Time Lodge three pukeholes over.
Thanks.
I'm Chrissy.
- I'm Hyde.
- Who cares.
You wanna hop on my Vespa and show me where it is?
Mother of God, I think I love you.
Love is an outdated concept used by industrialists to keep women subservient.
Mother of God, I do love you.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Damn.
Damn.
Damn.
What happened?
You just beat me 15-nothing.
So what?
I mean, hitting a ball with two paddles is so boring.
I need a new challenge, something totally different.
I need to hit the ball with smaller paddles.
Where's Red keep his tools?
No.
Not Red's Pong.
I don't think you should be going The garage!
Of course!
Okay, if you screw that up, he's gonna blame me.
I know.
Who'd have thought I'd meet a radical number like you in a slag heap town like this.
I can't believe you're just passing through, man.
You're dark, you're obnoxious you're dangerously paranoid.
Until tonight, I didn't even know a girl like you existed.
Has it occurred to you that we're on a bed?
Man, this is so perfect.
You're easy, too?
Yeah.
See, the establishment doesn't want us having sex because they know it makes us feel good, right?
So if we can feel good on our own, what do we need the establishment for?
So, every time we have sex it's a huge protest.
You know what?
I think I feel a huge protest coming on.
Thank you so much for helping with my home ec project, Mrs. Forman.
You're welcome, honey.
Now, Jackie, have you ever made a pie before?
No, I don't really cook much.
I just plan on getting by on my looks.
Okay, then.
Michael.
Jackie.
- What are you doing here?
- I'm baking a pie.
I'm making small paddles.
Fine.
Fine.
So, Donna, what say you and I take a little drive tonight?
I don't know.
Do you think you can unlock the car?
Where should the three of us go on our drive?
Actually, Fez, just Donna and I are gonna I see.
So, you are going to ditch me.
Just like Hyde.
Every day, I am here with my heart on my sleeve hoping only for friendship and acceptance.
And what do I get?
Abandonment.
Loneliness.
When is it Fez's turn?
Where is my whore?
Damn you, Hyde.
Did you go horseback riding without me?
No.
I just met the most amazing woman.
Chrissy.
And she just ditched her entire life to start over in New York, man.
Wait.
- Why is she going to New York?
- She's going to start a punk band.
A punk band.
Cool.
What is punk anyways?
Punk is the nihilistic outcry against the corporate rock and roll takeover.
It's the soundtrack to the revolution, man.
I thought you said Blue Oyster Cult was the soundtrack to the revolution.
Look, the point is that she asked me to go with her.
Why would you want to go to New York?
It's a big city, man, the bars are open until 4:00 that's where all the music's happening.
- If I can make it there - You can't make it there.
- But if I can make it there - But, you won't make it there.
Would you just listen.
If I can make it there Damn it, Forman, now I lost my train of thought!
Kelso!
You have 10 seconds to tell me what you're doing.
I can explain Nine seconds!
See Eight!
But the counting - Three.
- What?
- There's no way that was five seconds.
- It is now.
Three!
I just wanted Two.
Smaller paddles.
Time!
Don't hurt me!
Smaller paddles?
Is it broken?
Okay, I'm too good at Pong.
It's a curse.
I know what you mean.
It's boring.
I haven't played this thing in over a month.
Right.
Exactly.
Okay, now stay with me here.
That's why I took it apart.
See smaller paddles equal bigger fun.
You may have something there.
We'll give it a try.
Seeing as you already opened it.
Great.
And if we can't put it back together, you owe me $118.
I don't have $118.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Okay.
Jackie, all right, honey.
Let's just review.
What do you think went wrong with this pie?
- Too many eggs?
- No.
- The pan was too small?
- Not even close.
Is it because Michael doesn't love me anymore?
Almost.
It's because you were talking on the phone about Michael instead of watching the pie, like you promised me you would this time.
Again.
You liar.
I don't know, Hyde.
I mean, here, you're the cool guy.
But do you know how many cool guys live in New York?
There's like Lou Reed, man!
Do you want to mess with that?
Why do you want to leave Point Place?
It is fun.
Yeah, it is fun, man and I'm gonna miss the hell out of you guys.
But Chrissy's cool.
And it's the Big Apple, man.
Do you think Lou Reed's in the phone book?
Because I bet he'd really like me.
Lou Reed.
Where are you going?
Who's Chrissy?
It's not bad here, man.
We got the TV.
And peanut butter.
And I got this thing.
The ball part rolled under the dryer.
Hyde, you cannot leave.
You gave me my first beer, remember?
And then I threw up on that cop.
That was a good time, man.
Wait a minute, back up nobody tells me anything.
What's the ball doing under the dryer?
So, Hyde's like really leaving.
Yeah.
It's like time's just passing us by.
You know, you've got to like seize the day.
- You are so right.
- Yeah.
Okay, what's so funny?
Nothing.
No, tell me.
I know you're going for the bra.
How did you know?
It's just, every time you go for my bra, your lips stop moving.
So you're really not having any fun?
No, I'm having a good time.
I would just like a little attention while you're struggling with my underwear.
I'm here too.
It doesn't always have to be about the twins.
The twins?
Is that what you call them?
That is so very hot.
Okay.
Take me home.
Jackie just take the money and buy a pie.
Mrs. Forman, if I buy a pie, that's cheating and I'll fail.
Trust me.
If you bake it, you'll fail, too.
What's this about Hyde moving to New York?
No.
He's only 17.
His mother would never let him do that.
Actually, Michael told me that Hyde's mom drinks a lot.
She probably won't even care.
You know drunk people are like that.
Okay let's make another pie.
I will make the filling and I will make the crust.
What will I make?
You will go into the living room and make me a drink.
He can't just drop out of high school.
And New York City is no place for a 17-year-old kid.
It's Sodom and Gomorrah with a subway.
We'll have to have a talk with him.
His mom sure as hell won't do it.
And somebody's got to beat some sense into that idiot.
Red, you do care.
Are you ready to rock and roll?
- We don't think that you should go.
- New York is a dangerous place.
A young man today needs a high school diploma.
In New York, you get mugged for no good reason.
Do you have any idea what the job market is like?
The people are rude.
And you have feelings.
Without that sheepskin, you are nothing.
And not the kind of nothing that you are now.
An even lower, more pathetic nothing.
They spit.
That's right, they spit!
What are you gonna put on your resume?
"Dumbass"?
I'm not afraid of anything, and I'm going.
That didn't go that great.
Way to go, Kitty.
Hey, don't touch!
I'm about to take off the doohickey.
Wait.
Red, don't you think we should disconnect the transistor from the secondary circuit board first?
Sure.
And then, we'll work on the doohickey.
Bitching.
It is too my suitcase!
Nothing in this house is yours!
Shut up!
So, your mom's taking it pretty hard?
No, I haven't told her yet.
So, Hyde, you're, like, really going through with this?
Yeah, man.
I mean, you know.
I know people spit on you there and the rats are as big as your head or whatever.
But this might be my only chance to escape, Forman.
You can't leave now.
We're finally getting old enough to do some serious damage to this town.
Remember we were gonna paint that pot leaf on the water tower?
Vandalism, while tempting is not enough reason for me to stay.
Plus, you can do that without me.
But we won't do that without you.
Hyde, you're the reason we do so many stupid, senseless things.
Yeah, that is true.
Hyde, I've never told this to another human being but I Cannot get Donna's bra off.
- Hooks or snaps?
- Both.
She keeps throwing me changeups.
All right, here's what you do, okay?
You buy a bra and you practice on it at home then you give it to Donna as a gift.
See, that's brilliant.
You're like an evil genius, man!
Where's your bag?
You're not going.
No.
But I'd like to mount another protest if you have the time.
This is my friend's number in New York.
Don't call me.
Yeah, I won't.
Chrissy do you mind if I steal the towels?
Sorry.
I already got them.
Kelso.
Good luck.
Yeah, she's been a great ride, man.
- It worked!
- Smaller paddles!
Congratulations, son.
You have seen the future.
Yeah.
You're so right, Red.
Home computers.
That is the future.
No.
Not computers.
Soldering.
The future is soldering.
Computers.
What do you know, we're parked again.
Right, but this time I just want to talk.
Donna, I'm really sorry if I did anything to make you feel uncomfortable.
Thanks.
I guess part of that's my fault.
But I think I know something that will make you feel better.
Okay.
You know, I've been having a rough time lately.
Now that we're boyfriend and girlfriend and you know I'm on the pill it's like you're always pawing at me.
I wanna fool around, but then I think if you get to second base you'll get a pretty good view of home.
If that happens, what will happen to you and me?
Look at what happened to Jackie and Kelso and sex changes everything and that really sucks.
Okay.
So, what part of that was supposed to make me feel better?
I'm not wearing a bra.
You are the best girlfriend ever.
You surprised to see me?
No, I knew you'd stay.
Yeah, we've been friends way too long.
No, Chrissy just drove by with some guy on the back of her bike.
Poor kid.
She's grieving.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Here, Bernice, I made you a plate of leftovers.
Thank you.
That reminds me, Red, my garbage disposal is still broken.
Just as long as you enjoy it.
Listen, I've got an idea.
Let's eat out next Sunday.
That way everybody can get something they like.
Okay, Grandma, time to get you home.
Eric, you gotta warm that car up for at least 10 minutes.
He's a good boy.
It's just a shame he doesn't have a better home life.
You know, Kitty, when I was raising children, the right way That's warm enough.
But you just said Show me tail lights.
Let's roll, grandma.
Turn off that beatnik music.
Watch the road.
You don't like it when I come to visit.
- Yes, I do.
I really do.
- You're a filthy liar.
You didn't learn to lie from my Red.
That came from your mother.
See, Grandma, that's the problem right there, okay?
Every time you come to my house you spend the whole day criticizing my mom.
- I tell it like it is.
- Okay, Grandma, then here's how it is.
You're very nasty.
And I don't see why you have to be so hateful.
I don't think being nice for a whole day would kill you.
Grandma?
Grandma?
Oh, God.
What's going on?
Just shooting some hoops.
I'll get it.
Eric, what's your grandma doing sleeping in the car?
She's not sleeping.
She's dead.
No, really.
She's dead.
What?
What are you talking about, she's dead?
I was driving her home and then I yelled at her and then she died.
- She died?
What did Red say?
- I'm not telling Red.
Eric, I don't mean to criticize, but are you insane?
You need to do something.
Eric, I just gotta get my eight-track out of the car.
Kelso!
Grandma Forman, can you just move your leg there?
Kelso, she's dead.
My God!
My God!
Eric, you're in shock.
You have to go inside and tell Red, right now.
Wait, will you do it?
Right now.
I forgot the Tupperware.
She sent back the leftovers.
This is so typical of your grandmother.
Why do I even put up with her?
Mom, I think you might be coming down a little hard on Grandma this time.
You know what?
She is just an evil, horrible little woman.
- What did she say about me this time?
- Not much.
So, did you get your Grandma home, okay?
You know, the strangest thing happened.
Okay, now here's the part where I get lost.
- How did she hit the sidewalk?
- I opened the door for her.
What the hell was going through your head when you did that?
Just yell at him, Red.
I'm sure that his grandmother dying hasn't upset him enough.
Eric, take your mother in the house.
She's hysterical.
Yes, sir.
And I have to tell you, sir, when we were driving I said to Grandma Eric, this is no time to get upset.
When is the right time?
I'll handle this, Eric, you just take your mother in the house.
Mom.
This is a terrible loss.
Mom, didn't you just say that she was evil?
I never said any such thing.
Okay.
Sweetie, I am so glad you're here.
Yeah, I had a final this week.
I'm so sorry, honey.
No, this couldn't have come at a better time.
I was really unprepared.
But I miss Grandma.
I know, honey.
We all do.
Mom, what is with all this food?
You know, busy hands are happy hands.
Say, would you like a cup of chili with your waffles?
I don't know.
Sure.
So, how did your brother take the news?
You know Marty.
He was talking about his feelings and then he started bawling, so I hung up on him.
I'm not paying long distance rates to listen to that crap.
Uncle Marty is so in touch with his feelings.
- It's like he's completely self-actualized.
- He's a dumb ass.
Now, Red, honey I don't think that you're really mad at Marty I think you are just going through one of the five stages of dealing with death.
What are you talking about?
There are five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.
Kitty, I've got two stages: anger and drinking.
I don't care what you said to your grandmother you did not kill her.
I did, Donna.
I killed her.
She was old and the shock of her grandson telling her that she was nasty killed her.
- Have you talked to Red about this?
- I'm not talking to my dad about this.
Do you remember how angry he got when I didn't rake the yard?
And this is, like, twice as bad.
I don't really want to talk about this anymore.
Eric, you need to talk about this.
Donna, we don't talk about things in the Forman family.
It's not like your house, where every time you have a "feeling" your dad gives you a big hug and a gold star.
- I'm just trying to help you here.
- I don't Talking isn't gonna help me, okay?
What's gonna help me is, like, drinking.
Now you're just being stupid.
- Forman, let's go get wasted.
- Great.
See?
Hyde's a real friend.
He's gonna help me get through my grandma's death.
Your grandma's dead?
Man let's go get wasted.
As fellow human beings, not brothers human beings, how do you feel?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I got away from this family.
I'm not afraid of my feelings.
I am.
Okay, now, who would like a Monte Cristo?
Kitty, groovy sandwiches.
- No red meat, right?
- No.
Just ham.
You know, Marty, we really should talk about Ma's funeral.
No.
Don't worry.
It's on me.
It's not a round of beers.
We'll split the cost.
Sweet Red.
So generous.
Even when you're low on funds.
I just want what's best for Mom.
Yeah, Marty, that's what we all want.
It's just that when I feel bad I don't cry like a little girl.
Waitress!
Waitress!
Forman, relax, okay?
Hi.
We're gonna need a pitcher and four glasses, please.
I'm gonna need to see some ID.
Of course.
I have mine right here but the rest of the fellas left theirs back at the military base.
Yeah.
Gotcha.
So, you're in the military.
- What base are you from?
- It's a secret military base.
I'm Charlotte, and this is my sister, Charlene.
Hi, I'm Ted.
Sgt.
Shaft.
You can call me Honcho.
I am Eric Forman.
Sally, put that on our tab.
And bring everybody a round of shots.
- What is going on?
- They're picking us up.
No!
- No, it's a good thing.
- Okay.
Excuse me, fellas, but we need to talk to the ladies.
- Yeah, these ladies are with us, okay?
- They came here with us, okay?
- Great.
- Get lost.
They are trying to pick us up.
I think you've had quite enough firewater there, chief.
You mess with Eric Forman and you mess with me.
Are you looking for trouble?
Yes.
I'm looking for trouble.
Anybody else?
There's three of us, so yeah.
So, where were we?
Yes.
You were picking me up.
Now, where is Eric?
It's 2:00 a. m. I'm worried sick.
Eric is acting out.
He doesn't have the emotional tools to deal with this tragedy.
You're an emotional tool, Marty.
Now, who would like lemon bundt cake?
Where the hell have you been?
I went to a bar.
Eric, have you been drinking?
- No.
I've been fighting.
- My lord.
Eric, it's okay.
- Just let the feelings out.
- Put them back in there, Eric.
- You know, when a father and son - Marty, you are this close to a headlock.
Goodnight.
Eric, just because there has been a tragedy in the family it's no reason to act crazy.
My son getting in a bar fight like some kind of bar-fighter.
Kitty, stop cooking and go to bed.
Okay, all right.
When the timer goes off one of you better take that roast out of the oven or there will be hell to pay.
Sit down, Eric.
Don't drink that, put it on your eye.
Come on, I'm kidding.
So, this is beer.
And as much as we all miss Bernice we must remember that she is now in a far better place.
You don't have to die to get to a better place, man.
- Just drive 50 miles in any direction.
- Shut up.
Are you okay?
I don't know, Michael.
It's just that death is so unexpected.
And we are such fragile beings never knowing when the flame of our lives will be blown out by the wind of death.
What?
I am so turned on, aren't you?
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- Car?
- Coat room.
Better.
I know we had our differences.
I married Red and you hated me.
Just try to be nicer to God.
Life is so complicated.
You get old and die.
Thank God I'm still young and hot.
Man, I can't believe they're just gonna throw that ring away.
No.
I can't.
My God, there is a body in here.
Well, Ma Oh, for God's sake.
Sorry, those should be closed.
Hey.
God, you got a black eye.
It looks pretty hot.
- You should see the other guy.
- Did you really lay him out?
No, I mean, he was huge.
I mean, you should have seen him.
The fact that I even took the punch is a testament to how tough I really am.
Sorry.
Look, Donna, I'm sorry about the other night.
I was acting crazy and I'm completely over it now.
I mean, you can't dwell on these things.
- So you had a heart-to-heart with Red?
- Hell, no.
- So you're still just suppressing everything.
- Sure beats dealing with it now, right?
Yeah.
Hug?
I'm really sorry your mom died.
It's, like, sad and stuff.
Hey.
Pretty great funeral.
Red, I'm sorry about your mom, man.
And I'm sorry Kelso's an idiot.
Mr. Red, always remember a mother's goodness is carried down forever by her sons.
Have you met my sister, Marty?
What's all this stuff?
Cameras.
My dad was an amateur photographer.
Had his own darkroom.
Really?
Forman, you have any naked pictures of your grandma?
No!
You do now.
My old train set.
Your train set?
That was our train set.
Really, it should have been mine.
You never played with it, right?
Red do you want to keep the trains?
- If you don't want them.
- It's not about me.
It's about what you want.
Make an honest declaration of your needs.
Would you cut the crap?
Just say to me, "Marty, I want the trains".
Marty I'd be glad to hang on to them for you.
- Are you asking me for them?
- No!
Fine.
Then I'll keep them.
Fine.
Go ahead and keep them.
I don't want the damn things.
Kitty, you go in there and tell that bastard to give me my trains.
Red, it's your problem.
I gotta make a pie.
Now see.
- Marty left you the trains.
- Yeah, he did.
And he even set it up right.
See, the stations are all spread out.
Five stops, five times the fun.
But if he thinks he's playing with them when he visits he's got another think coming.
Now, Red, you have to share with your brother.
I don't wanna.
Okay.
I am gonna go make a coffee cake.
Dad, nice trains.
Yeah.
You know, I can't believe that your grandma held on to them all these years.
I thought she'd thrown them away.
- Yeah, she was a good egg, Grandma.
- Yes, she was.
You know, when I was a little boy, I hated peaches and Mom knew that.
So whenever she made a peach pie she'd make a little blueberry pie.
Special, just for me.
You know, she was the first one to call me Red.
And the last time I saw her I didn't I didn't say, I love you I didn't even say good bye.
I said, "Show me the tail lights".
Dad the last thing I said to her was: "It wouldn't kill you to be nice".
But I think it did, because she died.
That could only happen to you, son.
It's okay.
I know.
What's the matter, Kitty?
I'm all out of eggs and flour.
Come here.
Eric, come here.
Do you think these diamonds are real?
Family moment.
I'll leave you three alone.
I'm just gonna wait over here.
I'm really sorry that our last conversation didn't go so smooth.
But look, that is not how I feel about you at all.
Then why did you kill me, Eric?
I'll never forgive you.
What the hell are you doing out here?
Freezing my nads off for a joke, man.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Guys, can we do something besides cruise?
That's the third time tonight we've driven by that house.
You know what we could do.
We could go skinny dipping.
Naked!
That's the way God intended.
No way.
- Why not?
It'd be fun.
- Sure, it's fun for you guys 'cause you get to look at us and that's a treat.
But we just get to look at you.
And that's nasty.
So, you don't want to do it?
- I don't care, I'll do it.
- You Okay, I'm in.
Naked is dirty.
Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty Dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty Dirty, dirty, dirty This was such a good idea, Michael.
This was so much fun.
Wait, except for the part where our clothes got stolen, you idiot.
By the way, Fez, nice tattoo, man.
Thank you.
It's the Blessed Virgin of Yorba Linda.
- Do you want to see her dance?
- No!
Look, guys, we need a plan.
I'm not driving up to the house with a car full of naked people.
Red hates you guys when you're dressed.
We can go to my house.
Yeah, your mom's used to having naked guys around.
She's not even home, you moron.
Put on the top 40.
Sit down, Fez!
I see London, I see Besticle.
What do you want me to do about it?
I don't know.
Tuck it in.
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Pork chops?
I thought we agreed to stick to a budget.
Pork chops aren't cheap.
You know, on the way to the market I tried to run over a cat.
But they are just so darn speedy.
Kitty.
The plant's gonna be closing soon.
I mean, we have to watch our money.
Maybe I could put you on the sugar diet.
- That'd save money.
- Sugar diet?
Sweet?
See, that's perfect.
Give me another spoonful.
Tasty and cheap.
Now, when I say cheap I mean, you know, not Shut up.
So, this is your home.
Yep.
This explains a lot of your behavior.
Come on, man, this place is great.
It's better than Forman's basement.
That's a color TV, I just got new vice grips so now we can watch any channel we want.
Hyde, your mom really just ran off with some trucker?
No, Forman, I made it up because it sounds so classy.
Why would she just run off with some trucker?
It's springtime.
Love is in the air, man.
Right, and she just left you here alone?
Look, I realize this is hard for you to get your head around, Opie but you're failing to see the upside here.
We've got food, we've got beer, we have zero adult supervision.
Welcome to Camp Naughty-Bad-Fun.
Jackie, you couldn't find anything?
Okay, no offense, Hyde, but all your mother's clothes are whorey.
What?
But they look great on you, Donna.
Thanks, Jackie.
Michael, can you please take me home?
Look, I think I caught something at the reservoir.
Like an eel?
Not that, you idiot.
I think I'm sick.
I caught an eel.
But, Midge why do you have to have your Woman Warrior meetings here every week?
Because none of the other feminists' husbands will let them.
Boy, those bastards.
I know.
Bob, these meetings have really opened my eyes.
For example, the English language is so oppressive to women.
I mean, why is it "mailman" and not "mailwoman"?
Why do they even call the mail "mail"?
Why not call it "femail"?
Yes!
You see, Bob, now you're thinking.
No, I'm not.
I'm just being funny, because it's stupid.
Okay, then that's why you're part of the problem.
My wife is a maniac.
I'm sorry, a womaniac.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know anyone else was in here.
- You must be Midge's husband.
- I guess.
She's a real gung-ho Woman Warrior.
- You must be very proud.
- I guess.
Call me old fashioned but when I see you sitting there eating a sandwich it makes me darn tooting mad.
I mean, I think a married man who provides for his family deserves to come home to a hot meal.
Don't you?
You're neat.
Eric.
I thought I told you to wash up for dinner.
I know it's difficult to hear with your head up your ass.
Get a move on.
Red.
You need to relax.
Anger is bad for the soul.
- It's Fez, right?
- Yes.
- Get out!
- Okey-dokey.
- Come on.
Wash up.
- Dad can I talk to you for a sec?
Do you think that Hyde could stay for dinner?
Eric, again?
I can't afford to feed your friends.
I can't even afford to feed you, but the law requires me to.
Look, his mom's out of town.
All right.
But you have to fill up on bread.
And the two of you are splitting a pork chop.
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.
So, you do know you're not getting any of that pork chop, right?
Is that so?
Michael, go away.
I'm sick.
I don't have any makeup on, my hair is a mess, and I look hideous.
Jackie, come on.
I don't care what you look like.
I just want to see you.
Why?
Because you're my girlfriend.
And I got you a present.
Oh.
Michael, that is so sweet.
It's the sweetest thing ever.
Let me hold it.
Thank you, lover.
Mom.
Yeah, I couldn't help but notice that you're not home yet.
Is that right?
Okay, great, yeah.
No, no, no.
You know whatever makes you happy.
Hey, Forman.
Hi.
Come on in, make yourself at home.
I'm out of beer, but if you want, you can break something.
Actually, I had my eye on the phone, so What's that?
It's crackers with ketchup on top for you know, for zest.
Okay, well I'm just gonna guess that Edna's not coming back.
No, man, she's just been delayed a little bit.
Okay.
- Okay.
Didn't there used to be a TV there?
- Yeah.
I pawned it.
You pawned your mom's TV?
Hyde, she's not coming back.
Okay, she's not coming back, all right?
So what're you gonna do?
Sell the house.
You rent.
I guess I'm in more trouble than I thought.
No, Hyde.
No, Hyde, I'm serious here.
- You need help, my friend.
- No, Forman, you would need help.
I'll be fine.
Cool.
I brought you this sandwich.
Fine, I'll take your sandwich.
After this, no more help.
Hyde's mom is gone and he is going downhill.
I mean, he's sitting over there in the dark, eating ketchup off crackers.
I ate gum off a parking meter once.
But it was on a dare.
I made $1.
Man, there's some suckers out there.
Crackers and ketchup are "K" words.
Which makes them naturally funny.
My God.
I can feel, like, all the molecules in my body.
I'm gonna count them.
One two three You guys disgust me.
Doesn't anyone care about Hyde?
My God, run, Scooby.
Now.
Run.
You know what's freaking me out?
I saw Jackie sick, without makeup.
And it was the freakiest thing I've ever seen in my entire, entire life.
Including the class trip to the sausage factory.
Ay.
If I never see the inside of another cow, it will be too soon.
Jerky?
eighteen nineteen I have the biggest hands in the world!
Damn it!
One, two So his mom's gone and I know he doesn't want any help but the Donner Party didn't get any help, and then they ate each other so Hey, don't bogart that jerky.
Yeah, no parents would be cool.
Like the Lord of the Flies.
Kelso, did you ever finish Lord of the Flies?
No.
So?
Nothing.
Look, what are we going to do about Hyde?
I think we should tell someone.
What am I gonna do about Jackie?
I can't even look at her.
She's unpleasant when she's healthy, so I can only imagine how she looks like.
Kelso Jackie's my friend and you're shallow and pathetic.
And you know what else?
My hands are huge!
They're like boxing gloves.
I am the greatest!
Okay, champ, whatever you say - Hello, Bob.
- Hi, Bob.
Sharon.
Bologna?
Bob, what are you doing?
Nothing.
We were just talking.
These Jordan almonds are for the feminists.
Yeah, sorry.
Come on, Sharon, I saved you a seat on the ottoman.
I mean, "ottowoman".
I'm sick of bologna.
I want a new sandwich.
Eric, I'm sure she's not abandoning Steven, she's his mother.
Mom, her exact words were "I know I'm your mother "but I'm abandoning you, Steven".
That doesn't sound very good.
No, sirree.
Red?
Look, Eric.
You know I'd love to help Steven.
I'm a giver.
But you can't squeeze blood from a stone, son.
You know, we could just pop over there just to check up on him.
No, I'm not going over there.
That's final.
I am not Santa Claus.
Thank God you're not Santa Claus, Red.
You scare the hell out of children.
Go away, Michael.
Jackie, please?
I really need to talk to you.
I want to apologize for screaming when I looked at you the other day.
It's just you looked really gross.
But I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I realized something.
I realized that just because you look bad now that doesn't mean you're gonna look bad forever.
I mean, I just saw your mom downstairs and even though she's pretty old, she's really hot.
And that gives me hope for the future.
Oh, Michael.
Let me finish.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I realized that this whole mess that's just a temporary thing.
But physical beauty, that lasts forever.
That is so true.
Later, baby.
Later.
Right.
And I tell them I can sell them the cheaper one but it'll wind up costing them more in the long run.
Which is a mathematical impossibility, but they buy it anyway.
I just love a man who's passionate about his work.
Come here.
You've got a little something right there.
Oh, Donna, this is Sharon.
She's part of your mom's feminist group.
She hates men, too.
I should be getting back to the meeting.
Why are you all dressed up?
I'm not dressed up.
This is California casual.
There's nothing going on here.
Everything is fine between your mother and me.
Okay.
Look, Donna, can't a man have a conversation with an attentive woman without getting the third degree?
Sure, Dad.
All right, apology accepted.
Now, be a good girl and sneak in there and get Daddy some of those Jordan almonds.
No, Dad, those are for the feminists.
God.
They got to her, too.
You You need a coffee table.
Yeah, that would really pull the room together.
Steven, I was gonna clean your kitchen for you, but frankly I'm afraid.
Well, it looks like he's got everything under control.
Kitty, I'll be in the car.
Red.
Steven, why don't you go and gather some clothes and I'll do a load of wash for you at our house.
Cool.
We can't let him live like this.
Kitty, he'll be fine.
I mean, compared to Korea, this place is Shangri-la wrapped in happy-fun candy.
Look, you know I'd like to help him.
We don't have the money.
- I suppose we could call social services.
- Yeah, see, now that's sensible.
- Yeah, they'll know what to do.
- Yes.
I mean, after all, they take thousands of cases every year.
So many, in fact, that they have to house them in gymnasiums.
Kitty!
With no heat.
Damn it!
I am tired of being Santa Claus!
Steven, you get your together and you get your ass in the damn car!
We're going!
Now damn it!
Move it!
Okay.
You are just the sweetest man alive.
You know, Red really yelled at me, Forman.
Yeah, get used to that.
This blows, man.
When I was living at home, I didn't have to answer to anybody.
I made my own rules.
You screwed me, Forman.
I told you this was none of your business.
Steven.
Eric.
Here's your cocoa.
Thanks, Mrs. Forman.
Thanks, Mom.
You're lucky I don't kick your ass.
Are you gonna eat your cookies?
- That's it.
I gotta get a tattoo.
- Please don't.
That's incredible.
But disgusting.
That, that's incredible and disgusting.
- Do you want to see her pick up a dime?
- No!
- How about a quarter?
- No!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Thanks, Mrs. Forman.
You know, we never had waffles at my house.
My mom always said a waffle iron was a luxury.
Like pillow cases or not getting hit.
Man, this is so cool.
You are welcome, Steven.
See, Eric, I told you I was cool.
Eric, did you tell your mother that she's not cool?
- What?
Well - Stop telling your mother she's not cool.
Fine.
Mom, you're super fly.
Thanks, honey.
Steven, would you like maple syrup or blueberry syrup?
You have syrup?
- Man, I love it here.
- And we love having you here, man.
You're like the brother I never had.
I mean, I have a sister, but I hate her.
So, this is great.
Eric, after breakfast I want you to rake the yard.
- Rake?
But, Dad, I was gonna - I'll do it.
Okay, Steven.
My God I love my new brother!
Hanging out Down the street The same old thing We did last week Not a thing to do But talk to you Whoa, yeah Hello, Wisconsin!
Kitty, look who's back in town.
My God Bull MacCrakin.
I thought you were in Chicago.
Nope.
I came back to Point Place to steal you away from this old S-O-B.
Bull, you still with Wendy?
No.
I got married.
Wendy was a couple dozen ladies ago.
Now, boy, that is a lot of ladies.
You remember when our destroyer got strafed and you got four chunks of hot shrapnel right in the knee?
Five.
I still limp when it rains.
- Yeah, great times.
- The greatest.
It is popping.
Help me.
It is popping in my mouth.
Fez, they're Pop Rocks, okay?
That's what they do.
They pop.
Jackie, you know what would be cool to do with these in your mouth?
Donna, look, everyone's here.
And I thought we'd be all alone.
Phew.
I get it.
They want to make out.
For her pleasure.
If I cannot watch them make out, can I watch you two make out?
- Yeah, sure.
- Michael!
I mean, no, Fez.
I don't know about you but McHale's Navy makes me feel extra sexy.
Whatever.
Take it outside.
I've got to do my homework, Frenchie.
Good one.
Now get out.
No, I'm serious.
Your mom just found out I failed a test.
- Did she yell at you?
- No.
She said she was really disappointed.
And then, before I knew what I was doing, I told her I'd try harder.
No.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now, here I brought you a sandwich to help you study.
- Thanks, Mrs. Forman.
- Eric, Steven is studying.
Don't bother him.
Why don't you and Donna go up to your bedroom?
Okay.
I mean, no.
Bad idea.
Just go outside to a well-lit supervised area and talk politely like decent young adults.
That sounds super, Mom.
Here's a crazy idea.
Why don't you do the dishes, Bob?
Why don't I do the dishes?
I work all day.
I meditate all day.
Why don't you meditate over the sink and wash the dishes?
Donna, will you tell your father he's a jackass?
Donna, your mother was fine until she met those feminists and started thinking.
Excuse me, Bob.
But I'm not happy!
Really?
Well, I'm ecstatic!
You better watch out, Eric.
'Cause it's all fun when you're making out on the couch but then they get bigger and bitchier!
No offense, honey.
You're not gonna get bitchier, are you?
Shut up.
Oh, no.
Bull, I can't believe you finally settled down with a nice girl.
He may have settled down all right, but I'm not that nice.
Red, I noticed in the paper that your plant's closing down.
Yeah, you can't compete with those damn foreign cars.
I tell you, if I'd seen this coming I'd have shot a little straighter during the war.
You know I'm opening another hot tub store right here in Point Place.
I'm telling you, you've always got a job with me if you want it.
I don't know, though, Bull.
You know this thing's pretty hot.
That jet just hit me right in the keister.
Yeah, believe it or not, some people like that.
Wanna ease back on the hooch there?
You're getting a little loose.
I am just happy.
It's like a bath.
Only it's outside.
It's fun!
You got a real nice setup here.
- I sure do like that Corvette of yours.
- Yeah, I baby that thing.
Remember when we got back from Korea, we were both gonna buy them?
Yeah.
I never did get that Corvette.
Got two kids instead.
- Kids.
That's great.
- Yeah.
I sure did want that Corvette.
Okay, you're done cleaning the garage.
Let's play some ball.
Hang on, man.
I gotta take out the trash.
You know, Hyde, seeing you work hard and take pride in what you do I lost a lot of respect for you, man.
You used to be my hero.
My lazy American hero.
Don't listen to them, Hyde.
I think it's great you're doing all my chores.
Eric, great job on the garage.
Thanks.
Hyde did it.
Yeah, I should have known.
It's actually clean.
- Nice going.
- Thanks, Red.
- What did you do?
- I love you.
Well, I love you, too.
Dinner, kids.
Okay, now, that was Bull on the phone and he has invited us to a party on Saturday night.
Yeah?
What's wrong?
It's just that I look at what Bull has, and I look at what I have and I wonder if I made a few wrong turns, Kitty.
Maybe you'll get a fresh start working for Bull.
Yeah.
I mean, I fought for my country.
I deserve a Corvette.
Okay, here we all are.
So, honey, how did you do on your history paper?
History not being I'm sorry.
I was talking to Steven.
I must say, all that studying really paid off.
Yeah?
What did you get?
A "D"?
No.
A "C" minus.
Way to go.
I got a "B".
You couldn't get an "A"?
Honey, don't listen to your father.
You did super.
And, Steven, you did super-duper.
Why does he get a "duper"?
Because we expect more from you.
Give me a break, Forman.
I don't have a mommy.
Don't sweat it, Eric.
You can only be as smart as God made you.
Or didn't.
All right, didn't you just flunk out of college?
- Get bent, twerp.
- Wear a bra!
Can we please not fight?
"Can we please not fight"?
Can you please not suck?
- Good one, Eric.
- Thank you.
All right, everybody shut up.
Now, we're gonna have a nice dinner.
Eric, you try to be more like Steven.
Where's Hyde?
- Mom and Dad are giving him a bath.
- Bath?
No, really.
I don't know, who cares.
Shut up.
I'm watching TV.
I hate you.
You're just jealous, right?
Because you're not number one anymore.
If I'm not number one, guess who's number three?
So your parents have brought a new bundle of joy into your home.
And you might feel like your parents don't love you anymore.
But that's not true.
They simply love you less.
You see, your parents only have so much love to go around.
Here's how your parents'love was distributed before the new arrival.
And here it is after.
But what can you do about it?
Well, you could run away.
As if they'd come and look for you.
Say, here's something you can do.
Think of all the good times you've had with your family.
Because they're all over now.
Okay, here we go.
Scotch rocks.
Scotch rocks.
And a mango margarita.
He was in the National Guard.
Oh.
You know, I almost forgot.
I'm gonna need your car keys.
- How drunk do you think I'm gonna get?
- Hopefully, drunk enough.
My wife's got my keys.
You know, Bull, if you were serious, I'll take that job.
You got it.
It'll be just like old times.
I mean, except for the killing.
Midge, I need my keys.
Sharon, hi.
- Honey, you remember Sharon.
- No.
Sharon, is it?
You are so funny.
How do you keep your hands off him?
I don't know.
I just do.
So my parents are fighting all the time and they want me to choose sides.
But I can't because they're both idiots.
I don't know.
I mean, I really think they're gonna get a divorce.
My God, Donna, I am so sorry.
But you know what?
That very thing happened to a good friend of mine and now she has twice as much stuff and twice as much clothes.
And her parents even fought over who got to buy her a car.
I mean, you're right, Jackie.
This divorce thing could actually work to my advantage.
Exactly.
Yeah, I just have to make it very clear that my love is contingent on how much they buy me.
Why am I even talking to you about this?
You have a great handle on it.
Excuse me Jackie, when exactly did you lose your soul?
Cheerleading camp.
You almost done there, Hazel?
See, that's funny 'cause Hazel is a maid.
- Or you could have called him Alice, too.
- Shut up, Fez.
So, pretty tough with that scrubber in your hand?
Yeah, I know.
Hyde, Red and Kitty aren't even here.
I mean, you're kissing phantom butt.
You know what, Forman?
I used to think Red was a real hard-ass.
But after doing your chores for the last five days I've come to the conclusion that you're just a lazy, spoiled brat.
Hazel never talked like that.
That's not fair.
You've been doing them for five days.
Try 16 years, man.
- You know, I guess I'm just grateful.
- Stop it.
You're making me look bad.
Plus you've become, like, a total drag to hang out with.
What ever happened to the psychotic troublemaker we all know and love?
Look, put down the dishes and start doing something stupid and senseless right now.
Forman, I'm a guest here.
Then fine.
I guess I will have to do something stupid.
I know something stupid we can do.
You got a bowling ball?
What?
And they're arguing and arguing and arguing.
Okay, no offense, Donna but all this talk about your mom and dad fighting it's boring me.
Really?
Talking about your hair was fascinating.
Hold it by the thumbhole.
Okay, what are those idiots doing?
Something idiotic.
Let's go find out.
Don't be such a baby.
We just want to see how high it'll bounce.
- Nothing bad can happen.
- Okay.
Forman, man, think.
You are listening to Kelso.
- Don't do it.
- Wait.
- Now you're telling me what to do?
- Enough talk.
Do it.
See, I never even thought of that.
Later.
Thank you.
See you.
Bye.
Maybe they won't notice.
Okay, Kitty, it's your turn.
Pick a key.
My gosh, there are so many, I can't tell which ones are ours.
Kitty, you don't pick your key because then you'd go home with your own husband.
And who wants that?
I Me?
But the whole point of a key party is to meet new and interesting people and have sex with them.
My God.
You're swingers.
Red, honey, it's time to leave.
- Now?
I'm having a good time.
- I left the iron on.
And the stove.
I left the iron on, on the stove which is also on.
And that It can't be safe.
- Kitty, what's wrong with you?
- Red, look whose keys I've got.
Dear Lord.
You lucky bastard.
Bite her earlobes, she loves that.
What the hell are you talking about?
Red, you do know that this is a wife-swapping party, right?
What?
Are you telling me you want to sleep with my wife?
No.
I'll take a run at any one of these ladies.
What the hell's wrong with my wife?
Nothing, Red, it's just done random so that it's fair.
That's all.
Bull I thought I knew you.
You do.
I'm the same guy who's got shrapnel in my No.
Good night.
Come on, Bob.
They're swingers.
Oh.
It took a really weird hop.
Why would you drop a bowling ball on the couch?
What good could come of it?
- Okay.
Hindsight being - Eric.
I don't want to hear any more of your dumbass excuses.
This is the most irresponsible, idiotic thing you have ever done.
Actually, Red, I did it.
You?
No, Dad, Hyde's just covering for me.
I did it.
- Forman, stop.
Red, it was me.
- No.
It was me.
Guess what?
I don't care!
You're both idiots.
And if you have to get a job digging ditches you are gonna buy me a new TV.
Now get out of my sight.
- Yes, sir.
- All right.
Sir.
I could've had a Corvette!
Oh, Red.
No, Kitty, damn it, I'm pissed.
I mean, Bull's a freako pervert and he gets everything he wants.
I work hard, I raise a family, and what do I get?
A bowling ball in my TV.
You know what I've got?
Your keys.
I want a big TV.
- A big one.
- This one's on sale.
That's last year's model.
And my TV's gonna be new.
- What about that one?
- No remote.
My TV's gotta have a remote.
Look at this.
Twenty-six-inch screen.
I didn't even know they made them that big.
Dad, your old TV wasn't that big.
No.
But my new TV's gonna be that big.
