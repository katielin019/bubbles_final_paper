{START OF EPISODE 1}
My dearest Topanga, it's day 58 of my summer road trip across this great country of ours with my dear brother, Eric.
This may be the last entry in my travel log, as my road buddy is becoming ornery.
Hi, Topanga.
I don't know why Cory thinks I'm ornery.
I'm actually, you know, pretty happy now that I've got the tape recorder and I don't have to listen to Cory yammer on for two months and 48 states about life on the road.
And speaking of the road, here it is now.
Tape recorder number 17.
The golden rays of the sunset remind me of the golden highlights in your beautiful hair.
You're insane!
I mean, how is it that everything you see in this country reminds you of Topanga?
Oh, you exaggerate, Eric.
I mean, I did not mention her once during our tour of the White House.
Hmm.
"Topanga's got a desk just like Chelsea's.
" Well, I didn't say anything at the Kennedy Space Center.
"Topanga's favorite movie is Apollo 13".
Mount Rushmore?
"Will you look at the lips on Teddy Roosevelt"?
I said that out loud?
You've Topanga-ed me to death, man!
Well, I, for one, Eric, had a delightful summer, and there's a part of me that's sorry to see this trip end.
Well, this trip is far from ended.
Why are you stalling?
I'm not stalling.
I just want to make sure I don't miss anything in these here United States.
Eric, we're three hours from home, you know?
We said we'd be home tonight.
Home.
Mom, Dad, Morgan, our sister who loves us.
How do you beat that?
"Entering Pottstown, home of the world's largest yogurt cup.
" He beat it.
Eric, listen to me.
We have to go home, and here's why.
I'm completely out of clean underwear.
Eh, big deal.
I ran out a week ago.
I'm sitting pretty.
Yes, but, you see, I don't know if you've noticed, but I've also run out of pants.
I want to go home.
I want you in pants!
Well, are you happy, Eric?
Your brother's wearing yogurt pants, and let me tell you something.
One size does not fit all.
Now can we please just go home?
Hey, not so fast.
They got a whole schedule of events here.
What kind of events?
It's a giant yogurt cup!
Now, why can't you just experience something new you've never seen before?
'Cause I don't wanna?
Look.
4:00, we have the parade of sprinkles, of the dancing lids I don't want to be here after dark.
Just stand here And smile.
Say Big pink spoon.
"Big pink spoon.
" Well, I am proud to be on the arm of the grocery store manager of the year.
If anyone deserves tonight's Grocey, it's you.
Oh, thank you, honey, but it's really no big deal.
You don't mean that.
Do you?
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Matthews.
Is Cory home yet?
Nope.
But soon, though.
I know.
According to tape Late tonight.
So is it okay if we wait?
Well, actually, we were on our way out.
That's okay, it's okay.
I'm just going to take a hot bath.
What?
There's seepage at the trailer park.
Shawn, I'd prefer that my son's friends didn't bathe in my home when I wasn't here.
Or ever.
Still in a bad mood, huh, Mr. M?
What bad mood?
Well, me and my dad noticed it when we were last at the market.
You know, we were eating our free samples, like we always do Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Sticking your own toothpicks in our turkey and steak does not make them free samples.
Fine!
We'll just take our business elsewhere.
Now, Mr. Eric from the city, uh, I'm flattered and everything, but why would a guy who's traveled back and forth across the state line be so keen on chatting up a small-town girl like me?
Just because I've been made wiser by my experience on the open road, that doesn't make me any better than you.
You know, the people that know me?
I'm just plain simple.
Like string.
I collect string.
Well, of course you do.
You're perfect for each other.
I can't get in the way of this.
Clearly this is bigger than I am.
Well, if I hurry, I can just make the parade of sprinkles.
Eric, if you don't have to take the hitchhiker boy home, not more than five miles from here is Burlick, Pennsylvania.
Tell me about this Burlick.
Burlick, Pennsylvania, home of the world's largest Yogurt cup.
Hey, wait a second.
You leave my girlfriend alone.
I'm going to the parade.
Perfect.
Ladies and gentlemen, mesdames et messieurs, Senores y Senoritas, Damen und Herren, the internationally-renowned Pottstown, Pennsylvania, parade of sprinkles!
Look!
The sprinkles is coming.
Oh, they are beautiful!
Hey, why is everybody wearing goggles?
My eyes!
Alan, I am so proud of you.
"Grocey award-winning Alan" to you.
I know the perfect place to put this.
Ta-da!
Well, there it is.
Twenty years in the grocery business and I've reached the pinnacle of my profession.
Um, Alan, when people win awards, aren't they usually happy?
I was just a kid who took a summer job and kept getting promoted while I was trying to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life.
Now it's 27 years later, and tonight, I won something.
I won the realization that I am Alan Matthews, I am 42 years old, I am a grocer.
You want to quit your job?
Ah, I just want to take a hot bath.
You don't want to get in that tub.
It's disgusting.
Uh, what Excuse me.
Could I have my robe back?
Hey, I'm naked under here.
Enjoy.
A motel room.
Only three hours from home.
I should be in my room tonight, not in a motel room in the middle of nowhere, with a toilet seat that has not been sanitized for my protection.
I don't believe that paper strip for a minute.
Better?
A little.
I told you, we just got this room so I could clean up for my date tonight.
Eric, I've been a good brother on this trip.
I mean, I've indulged your little whims, I've been very supportive.
Why're you doing this?
I'm just not ready for the summer to end yet.
Well, I am.
I mean, I got a girlfriend.
I got Shawn, I got school.
I got a life waiting for me back at home.
Yeah, you do.
That must be nice, huh?
I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
I know you weren't.
I mean, I did this to myself.
I didn't get into college, all my friends did.
I don't have a job, so See, there's really nothing for me to go home to.
Hi.
Hi.
Are you ready?
Uh, yeah, I am.
Wait a minute, Eric, what are you saying?
Cor, I'm not going home.
Cory?
Eric, please.
Just come to your senses and tell me we're leaving.
Oh, Cor, I have come to my senses.
This place is great!
I mean, it's got Irene, it's got soup, it's got pie, why would I ever leave?
Eric, it's not your home.
That's right, it's not.
At home, I'm a loser.
Here, I find happiness.
You're trying to take it from me.
No, Eric.
You didn't find happiness.
You just pulled off the road.
I mean, you can't stay here for the rest of your life.
You just pulled off the road.
Maybe this is my exit.
Look, Eric, we've been gone two months, all right?
Mom and Dad are waiting.
I think we owe it to them at least one of us shows up.
You got money for the bus.
Bus?
I'm taking the car.
Huh?
Cory!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
You can't take the car.
You don't know how to drive!
Eric, what can happen?
I lose control of the car and crash into, what, the world's largest Slurpee?
Lay off my town.
Eric.
You're still here.
Why wouldn't I be?
We had a great night together, didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
I, um I was thinking maybe you found someone more interesting and I wasn't going to see you again.
Well, I think you're very interesting.
That makes me happy.
Uh, do you want to say hi to my friends?
They're real eager to meet you.
Oh, and the little hitchhiker boy is more than welcome to join us.
No, this is where the little hitchhiker boy says goodbye.
So, Eric, if you're staying, then there's nothing left to say except I'll be the one driving through the corn field.
Okay, fine, at least let me check to see if you have the right keys.
What a moron.
Well, you can take the keys, Eric, but you can't take my freedom!
You don't have to worry about him.
Nobody in this town will pick him up.
Why?
Well, 'cause everyone in town is here.
Quaint.
I like that.
What?
Well, that was nice.
What was that for?
You're different from any guy I've ever met.
When you talk to me, you look in my eyes, and And what?
When I hear your voice, it sounds really smart, and that makes me feel special.
Me, too.
So, any time you're ready to open up, I'm ready to listen.
I blame you.
What?
I blame you.
I only kept this job to take care of you, you and the And the, the Kids?
Yeah, the kids.
I was just a bag boy who didn't have sense enough to leave.
And now that's what I am for the rest of my life.
Oh, Alan, what you do for a living is only a little of what you are.
It's not mostly what you are.
Well, then what am I, mostly?
Mostly You are a person that I love a whole lot.
And I want you to be happy.
Well, right now I am not happy settling for what I am.
What the hell are we looking at?
George Hmm?
Do you hate your job or what?
No.
The only job I ever hated was that horrible job as a bag boy at the supermarket.
I'm certainly glad I had the sense to get out of that after about a day.
You've been listening, haven't you?
Voices carry.
Seriously, George, I mean, you've been a teacher all your life.
Do you still enjoy getting up in the morning?
Oh, Alan It would be very easy for me to tell you that I have dedicated the last 38 years to several thousand young minds, and that is my chief joy and reason for getting up in the morning.
Except it isn't.
I teach because I like it.
And because it's fun for me.
Ah, but when it stops being fun?
Well, then I suppose I would look to my family and friends for support to help me find something new.
Well, thank you, George.
You've taught me something.
And it was fun for me.
Oh, who am I kidding?
I mean, who would possibly stop and pick me up in the middle of rural Pennsylvania?
Whoa!
Young friend, how far art thou traveling?
Me?
Yes, thee.
Uh, well, I'm going to Philadelphia.
Well, I'm going as far as That farmhouse there.
That farmhouse there?
Yes.
That farmhouse there.
I see.
Well, I'm going to Philadelphia.
Well, I could take you as far as That farmhouse there.
And that's very nice of you, but maybe I'll just wait for some form of transportation that involves combustion.
I understand.
But if you change your mind, I'll be at That farmhouse there.
Yes, but you see, if that's as far as you're going, then it does me no good.
That is true.
But my intent was just, and my heart is pure.
Also does me no good.
Frankly, that's the best darn pea soup I've ever had.
Well, it's the soup that brings you in, but it's the pie keeps you here forever.
I was only three hours from home.
Oh.
Oh!
That is delicious!
What kind is this?
Pie.
Pie.
Well, you know, with food this good, you must have people lining up to get in here.
Truth is, we're probably going to have to close her down.
Irene?
I'm afraid it's true.
I mean, ever since they built the new highway, folks kind of just blow by this town.
You know, they wouldn't if they knew how good your soup and pie are.
I told you that.
Okay, now, I don't know if this is anything, but when I was driving through Texas, I started noticing all these signs advertising the world's best chili, and, like, every mile, there would be another sign that would say, like, "100 miles to the world's best chili.
" "99 miles.
98 miles.
" So by the time I finally got there, I just had to have some of this chili.
You see?
It's pie.
No, what Eric's saying is that we put signs up on our highway chatting up our soup and pie.
You're a real smart young man, Eric.
You think so?
Why, sure.
Now, certainly a man of the world like yourself feels more at ease in the big city, but a guy like you could do pretty well in a town like ours.
You think so?
Maybe I will stay for a while.
Really?
Yeah, you know, good woman, good friends, good pie.
I think I could be happy here for the rest of my life.
Eric.
Let's see, do you really think you could be happy here?
I'm already happy here, Cor.
These people have taken me in.
They've made me feel important.
Back home, I'm just a loser who didn't get into college, but here, I could be king.
Well, congratulations.
I'll just tell Mom and Dad.
I know they'll be so proud.
I know I am.
I'm the prince of Sprinkle Land.
Hey.
Soup and pie for everybody.
The new guy's buying.
Oh, man, this is good pie.
I was three hours from home.
Dad!
Cory!
Don't eat the pie.
You'll never leave.
Where is he?
Oh, His Royal Highness?
I believe he's holding court over there.
Eric.
Dad!
Hey!
Dad, these are the guys, and this is Irene.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Irene.
Guys.
Uh, Eric, your mother and I decided that you were responsible enough to take your brother on the road for two months.
Now, is this the way you thank us?
I was going to call you in the morning and let you know my plans.
I'll tell you your plans.
You're going to get in your car and follow me home without stopping anywhere.
Now.
Come on.
Um, actually, I'd rather stay here with Irene and the guys.
Maybe we better do this in private.
So, there's a lot of opportunity for a guy like me in this town?
Well, I could use a nurse.
Now, why don't you tell me what this is really about?
I don't think you'd understand.
Try me.
I don't see the point in going back home.
Why not?
Because there's nothing there for me, Dad.
I mean, I went to nursery school, grammar school, high school, for what?
I mean, I didn't get into college.
Everything I've done up until now has been a waste, and it's just too late to change who I am.
Uh-huh.
See, I knew you wouldn't understand.
Hey, no, no, no, listen.
This is something I understand real well.
I mean, it's very easy to find some place that's comfortable and just stay there.
Now, what's wrong with being comfortable?
I mean, I think I could do pretty well settling in a place like this.
But that's it, Eric!
That's all you'd be doing, just settling.
And over the years, you'd try and convince yourself that that's the life you really wanted, but you don't.
I mean, you just stumbled into it, and you'll never love it.
And one day, you'll realize that all you've done is settle, and you will not like yourself for that.
I don't like myself now, Dad.
What am I even going home to?
To the support of your family and friends who'll help you find what you really want.
I'm afraid to go home.
Eric, you never have to be afraid to go home.
How are you so sure?
Because he's Dad.
Yeah.
That's mostly what I am.
Let's go.
They're up and on their way down.
I told them you made blueberry pancakes.
I didn't make blueberry pancakes.
Oh, they're lucky we let them live here.
Topanga, are you and Cory going to kiss?
Morgan, I think that's very personal and we shouldn't talk about it.
Come on, just between us girls.
Right on the lips.
Topanga, he's not going to have time for you.
The man has been gone for two months and we have so much catching up to do, he's not even going to know you exist.
Shawn!
Cory!
Hey!
Hey!
Good summer?
Great summer.
Lot of stories?
Lot of stories.
You miss me?
I missed you.
We still best friends?
The best there ever were.
Good.
You see?
You see?
Hey, I'm talking to you!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
El bateador va al bate.
Para los Seattle Mariners, numero veinticuatro, Ken Griffey Jr. Eric, you were doing it again.
What, the Jenny McCarthy dream or the Spanish baseball announcing?
Beisbol.
Good.
Jenny's starting to get needy.
Tell you something, Cory, you hit a certain age, you are afraid to go to sleep at night.
I'll tell you something else, Eric, you hit a certain age, you're afraid to wake up in the morning.
You're avoiding the mirror again.
No, I'm not.
Listen to me, Cory.
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to look at yourself, my friend.
Come on.
Aw, man.
It's me.
Come on, Cor.
Every teenager goes through this gawky, awkward, hate-what-they-look-like phase.
Well, what about you?
Yeah, you think that, baby.
Listen to me.
Why don't we stick with the problem that is your head, all right, my friend?
Now, for the next few years, you're gonna be growing into your look.
Everybody understands that.
Nobody's gonna give you a hard time about it, okay?
Hi, I'm Cory, and for the next three years, I'm gonna look like a potato.
Morgan, you wanna get out of here?
No.
The child speaks the truth.
I, Cory Matthews, am a po-ta-to.
I'll just take that, Mr. Matthews.
Now I got no pipe.
Yes.
Fine.
You're perfect.
Now, can we get out of the hallway where everyone can see me?
Hold on.
Just need to get a little more hair in my eyes.
You know I hate that.
Also good.
Also good.
Also good.
Move!
Whoa, whoa.
Cory, Cory.
Come on.
Come on.
You're gonna cut your fingers.
You're right.
I'm overreacting.
It's just that between you and Eric, I feel like I'm surrounded by people with perfect hair.
Hi, Cory.
No need to explain this relationship, is there?
What are you guys talking about?
Nothing.
I'm just a little insecure today, but I'm sure it'll pass.
Hey, Topanga.
Hey, Dylan.
So, you wanna go out this weekend?
Of course not.
I'm going out with Cory.
Oh, you're still with him?
I figured you'd have dumped him over the summer.
Would you please leave?
Yeah, but if you do decide to dump him, here's my card.
"Locker number 168".
Huh.
That's a nice locker.
Look, Cory, it's just some guy asking me out.
It's no big deal.
Well, it's no big deal to you because you're the askee.
And why are you the askee?
You're always the askee because you are gorgeous.
Well, thank you very much, but give me some credit.
I know guys go out with girls because of how they look.
But you go out with me because of who I am inside.
The only reason you think I'm good-looking is because you care about me.
That was one too many.
It wouldn't matter what I looked like.
You'd still think I was pretty.
Yeah, but, Topanga, I mean, this is easy for you to say.
You don't have a nose that takes up half your face and hair like a Brillo pad.
Come here.
What?
You saw suds?
First of all, I love your face, and I love your hair, but most of all, I love you because of who you are.
And I hope you love me because of who I am and not because of my face and hair.
Cory.
Topanga, if I looked in the mirror every morning and saw what you see, I'd feel real good about myself, too.
Oh, so you think that's it?
You think what gives me all my confidence is my face and hair.
And the fact that they're perfect, yeah, I think that puts a little spring in your step.
Oh, yeah?
Well, here's what I think.
Words, Topanga.
Use your words.
Well?
Am I any different now?
Well, somewhat less predictable.
But, no, you're right.
I'd love you no matter what you looked like.
Good.
Glad you learned something.
She's gonna scream now.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's just a little hair.
It has nothing to do with who I am.
I am still Topanga Lawrence, and nobody who cares about me will even notice, right?
Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Hunter.
Ooh.
What the heck happened to you?
Mr. Feeny, I've cut my hair in an attempt to show Cory that physical appearance is secondary to inner beauty.
A-ha.
Well, in that case, Miss Lawrence, I applaud your attempt at teaching a very valuable lesson during these extremely vulnerable teenage years.
You think I'm ugly!
Nice going, Feeny.
Man coming in.
Man coming in.
I'm not looking.
I'm just here on business.
Now I'm taking my arm down.
You'll probably want to scatter.
Go ahead.
Scream.
Scatter.
Make a big scene.
See, 'cause I'm a boy.
Hey, how come you guys get a couch?
Sometimes we need to lie down.
You see, that's where guys are different.
We're in, we're out.
We don't like to linger.
Look, Cory, I'm having some problems right now, and I'd really like to be alone.
Well, I'll be alone with you.
Look, you don't have any problems.
I mean, look at yourself in the mirror.
You're still beautiful.
I can't look in the mirror.
Topanga, you were right.
It doesn't matter to me what you look like.
It only matters to me who you are.
See, that's my problem, Cory.
I thought I was someone who thought that appearance didn't matter, but that was only because I was comfortable with my appearance all this time.
But now I'm not.
How shallow can I be?
You are not shallow.
You're deep.
You're the deepest, most thoughtful, profound person I've ever known.
How's my hair look?
Well, that's not one of your strong points anymore.
You gotta let that go.
Look, how long did it take you to grow your hair that long?
Six or seven years.
That's perfect.
Because in six or seven years, you'll grow your hair back, I'll be out of my goosey-goosey stage.
Don't you see?
It makes us even closer as a couple because now we are in perfect sync.
See, Cory.
That's why I love you.
Thanks.
Today after school, I'll go down to the beauty parlor and get this all evened out.
Great idea.
So, how'd it go?
Topanga's going to the beauty parlor after school.
Everything's fine.
Huh.
So what do you want to do now?
I don't know.
Wanna sit on the couch?
Yeah.
This has been a Quinn Martin production.
You solved that crime, you fat, fat man.
Eric, it's 4:00.
You were sitting there when I left this morning.
You were supposed to look for a job.
Think I found one, Mom.
Check it out.
All day long, I've been watching crimes on TV solved by old guys, by fat guys, by guys with wrinkled raincoats.
So, naturally, it occurs to me, what this world needs is "Eric Matthews, good-looking detective.
" I'm gonna do so much homework.
Check it out.
I already thought of a theme song.
* When a crime breaks out * All the cute girls shout * "Get the good-lookin' guy" * When there's a crime out there * He's gonna comb his hair * 'Cause he's the good-lookin' guy * Book him, good-lookin'.
Honey, I'm scared for you.
You have got to get out of this house.
Well, to do what?
I mean, Mom, let's say I do find one of these so-called "jobs.
" I mean, with nothing better than a high school diploma, the best I can ask for is minimum wage.
And what they take out for taxes?
Honestly think I can do better solving crimes.
* When a crime breaks out * Stop.
Sweetheart, you cannot just mope around the house.
Why don't you go out on a date?
You used to date all the time.
I know, but all the girls I used to date have gone off to college.
Oh, I'm sure there's plenty of nice girls right here in town.
Townies?
You want me to date a townie?
Oh, that is great, Mom.
I can see them right now sitting on their couch in their ratty bathrobe, watching daytime TV, eating bonbons.
These are Cocoa Puffs.
And I'm a detective.
I don't know, man.
She's been in there an awful long time.
What are you getting so crazy about?
She's just getting a haircut.
No, Cory.
We've known Topanga all her life, okay?
She doesn't wear make-up.
She's never been to a beauty parlor.
She's completely natural.
So what's the big deal?
The big deal is she was beautiful before without anybody's help.
Now she's got professional help.
She's gonna be mega-beautiful.
We're not even gonna be able to look at her directly without burning our retinas.
Shawn, come on.
This is not Beverly Hills.
I mean, it's a neighborhood beauty salon next to old lady Schneider's doughnut shop.
I mean, they don't exactly do "miracles" here.
Old lady Schneider.
It's a miracle!
Oh, no.
Shawn, Topanga is gonna come out looking 10 times better than she did when she went in.
Okay, the first thing she's gonna do is dump you, then starting hanging out with other unbelievably good-looking people.
How do you know that?
It's what we do.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I think that's interesting, but, oh, so wrong.
And why is that?
Because if anybody knows hair, it's me.
When I get a haircut, it looks terrible for, like, the first six weeks.
Then all of a sudden, it looks terrific for, like, a day.
Then it's time for another haircut.
It's what I like to call the haircut cycle of shame.
Okay, and that's what you think's gonna happen to Topanga?
Yes, I do.
Because the universe knows that Topanga and I are supposed to be together, so the universe has seen fit to put Topanga in that chair and make her hideous so we can get through our teenage years awkward hand in awkward hand.
You know she's coming out great-looking, don't you?
Yes!
This universe blows!
Well, isn't somebody going to say something?
She's my best friend's girl, she's my best friend's girl Oh, the heck with that!
Marry me!
I live in a trailer park and I have no education, but my hair does this!
Shawn!
Shut up, man!
I'm going for it!
Thanks.
Thanks.
I'm back.
Good.
All right, Topanga, I want I want the name of the guy who did this to you.
You don't like it?
No, no, it's not that I don't like it, it's just that I'm in love with this girl who was never interested in what she looked like before, and now I see make-up on your face and polish on your nails and toes and Stop looking at her toes.
But they sparkle.
I want the name of the guy who did this to you.
My stylist's name is Mr. Cellini.
Cory, it's just a haircut.
It's just some make-up.
It's not going to change me.
Gotta go.
Well, where are you going?
This outfit with this hair?
Hello, bye-bye.
I am so at the mall.
You know, Shawn, this just isn't like Topanga.
Obviously, she's under the influence of this so-called Mr. Cellini.
Yeah.
I say we go back there.
You are my friend, aren't you?
Of course I am.
And that little thing with Topanga?
Well, I think the three of us can be very happy together.
All right, which one of you guys worked on Topanga Lawrence?
Ah, that would be me, Bosco Cellini.
All right, Bosco, I want to know where you come off taking a natural beauty like Topanga and painting her face and nails and messing with her beautiful hair?
"Messing"?
Hey, friend to the little whining boy, did he say "messing"?
Yeah.
That's what I heard.
Well, for your informazione, it is very rare that on a Tuesday, our slow day, that Venus de Milo herself would sit in my chair and say to me, "Make with me what you wish.
" I am a European man secure enough in my own masculinity to admit to you I wept.
I cried like a little baby cries.
All right, all right, Bosco, first of all, we're in the middle of Philadelphia here, so let's just drop this phony accent.
Scusi?
Talk in English!
All right, all right.
Here's how it went down.
Chicky comes in, plops down a half a c-note, right?
I do a little snippety-snip, badda-boom, badda-bing, your girlfriend's a looker.
You're right.
I mean, she is beautiful.
Okay, let's go, buddy.
There's nothing left for you here.
You did a very nice job.
Hey, don't mention it.
So I'm kind of at the crossroads of my life because I didn't get into college like the rest of my friends.
Oh, you didn't?
No.
Looks like I'm kind of stuck here in town for a while.
It's not so bad.
Really.
You get used to being here.
Yeah, I mean, I'm okay with it.
Actually thought there was a career for me out there as a weatherman.
I even interned at Channel 5.
Wow.
Yeah, but I don't know.
I guess they thought I was too young and didn't have enough life experience, which, frankly, I think is crazy.
I mean, I'm 18.
I've lived, you know?
Oh.
I hear you.
I'm 18, and I feel like I have some life experience.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I mean, I have a two-year-old to take care of.
He's a big handful.
And in between putting him in daycare and working double shifts at the Dairy Queen, I actually wouldn't mind a little less life experience.
Can't your parents help you?
You've got your mom and dad helping you?
Well, you know, just financially.
That's nice.
You're very lucky, Eric.
Yeah, thanks.
I guess I'm luckier than I thought.
All right, everybody, take your seats.
Come on, take your seats.
What is so interesting that you all have to crowd around here Oh, boy.
Look at you.
Yeah.
I got a haircut.
Do you like it?
Hey!
Hey!
Focus, Mr. Turner.
Some are here to learn.
Okay, today, we're going to be talking about John Merrick, immortalized in the play The Elephant Man.
Now, even though he was tragically disfigured, he still won the hearts of London society with his wonderful inner spirit.
Yeah, you know what?
I come from a great-looking family, and I'm just going through my awkward teenage phase, but that doesn't mean I can't win the hearts of high school society with my wonderful inner spirit.
Now, see, what's really interesting about John Merrick is that he came from a wonderful-looking family, yet was so hideous himself, he was forced to wear a burlap sack over his head and perform as a sideshow freak until the day that his oversized head rolled back and he died.
And when did he grow out of this death?
Attention, please.
Excuse the interruption, Mr. Turner.
A reminder that this Friday is picture day, so, please, dress nicely and try to look your best.
Shawn?
Yeah?
I just want to die.
Please don't lift my oversized head.
Ah, Mr. Cellini, you've got to help me!
Si, Cellini is here to help.
Oh, it's you, the little whiny kid.
No, I don't want you to be that guy.
I want you to be Cellini the artist.
I want you to help me like you helped Topanga.
Forget it!
I don't take walk-ins.
You don't walk in here in the middle of the afternoon and expect me to take a walk-in.
Well, I'm walkin' in with 75 bucks.
Attencione!
Cappuccino for the whiny kid.
Sit.
* When a crime breaks out * All the cute girls shout * "Get the good-looking guy" * When there's a crime out there * He's gonna comb his hair * 'Cause he's the good-looking guy * What the heck are you doing?
This is who I am now, Daddy.
I'm a townie.
I'm worse than a townie because I rely on my parents for economic support.
I didn't even buy this cereal.
You bought this cereal.
You bought my clothes.
You bought this cereal.
You bought the milk which was white when it started, but it's chocolate now because it's Cocoa Puffs and I've been sitting here for 9 hours.
Eric.
Yeah?
Get off your butt.
Get a job.
Huh?
Right now!
Thank you, Daddy.
So here's how I see it.
You know, you guys really can't make it a habit to be in here.
I grew up with these two people, and I guess they're my two best friends in the world.
Anybody I know?
As I understand it, one of them, who in my opinion is a good-looking guy, is going through a shaky time right now.
Where is Cory?
That's not as important as where you are, Topanga.
In all the time that I've known you, I can't remember you ever looking in the mirror.
You had this confidence in yourself, and I really liked that about you.
Come on, Shawn, everybody in high school has a mirror in their locker and checks each other out and only cares about how they look.
But up until a couple days ago, you never did.
Your world got completely rocked when you hacked your hair off and saw that for two seconds you can actually look a little less than perfect.
This isn't me, is it, Shawn?
Well, it's not the Topanga I know.
But obviously we're all at that age where we're going through changes.
Oh, that's great.
Thanks.
Stop!
Stop!
Please don't touch him!
Too late.
I am finito and proud to say this is my best work ever.
Everything I have done until now was dreck.
This is my masterpiece!
Oh, he's beautiful.
Of course!
I have had to call upon all of my skills and powers.
I really look okay?
I think I'm falling in love all over again.
And you, you wet rodent!
What have you done to my work?
Once again, as a European, I weep without embarrassment.
What are you talking about?
She looks beautiful.
Just like she always was.
You, too, Cory.
Just like you always were.
Mom?
Dad?
I did what you said.
I got a job.
Oh, Eric, we're proud of you.
Hey, what kind of job did you get?
Check it out.
* When a crime breaks out * All the cute girls shout * "Get the good-lookin' guy * "Good-lookin' guy" * When there's a crime out there * He's gonna comb his hair * 'Cause he's the good-lookin' guy * When a crime breaks out * All the cute girls shout * "Get the good-lookin' guy" Eric.
Mommy?
Eric, wake up!
Daddy, I was fighting crime!
Eric, put down the Cocoa Puffs and get a job!
Okay, okay.
Send me out in my bathrobe.
What kind of job could I possibly get in a bathrobe?
At night.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
All right, I'm going to do something I haven't done in a very long time.
Hold me, Mommy!
What?
Eric, you've only applied for one job.
There's plenty more out there.
It wasn't just any job.
It was the Gap.
I mean, if anybody should be working at the Gap, it's me.
I mean, look.
I'm Gap!
All Gap!
Even when I'm in the shower, I'm Gap!
You didn't put that on your application, did you?
No.
They said I wasn't qualified.
I told them a monkey could work there.
Mom, it was the weirdest thing.
Last night, I'm walking by the Gap.
They got a monkey selling jeans.
I gave them that idea.
Well, next time you go out for a job, wear a diaper and smoke a cigar.
People like that.
Morning.
Hey, Dad, I need $25 for a class picture.
$25?
How big is your class?
Everyone else paid.
The teacher said if I don't pay today, they're going to airbrush me out.
Fine, fine.
Take, take.
Oh, Dad, keep your wallet open.
I got pictures, too.
What grade are you in?
Eleventh.
We got enough of you.
Alan!
Fine, fine.
Take, take.
I'll work Sundays.
"I'll work Sundays"?
I'm not thrilled working there weekdays.
Amy, I'm doing something about my job.
Dad, you can't quit.
I can't support this family.
I am not a monkey!
Amy, I'm going to ask for a raise.
Is that what you think will make you happy?
Happier than I am now, and I'm not coming back into this house until I get it.
Mom, why is Dad standing outside the house?
You didn't get it.
No, I got it.
I walked in, I said to Pete, "Pete, we got to talk.
" He said, "Alan, nothing to talk about.
How is $5,000"?
$5,000?
Come inside.
Sit in the nice chair.
Amy, I think I could have gotten even more.
Well, then sit in the nice chair and use the nice phone.
Call Pete and ask for it.
Well, actually, I don't think calling Pete would make much sense.
Why not?
Because I don't work there anymore, Amy.
I quit.
Would you pass the potatoes?
Dad, you quit your job?
We're going to be poor.
We're not going to be poor.
Alan, how could you quit your job without even discussing it with me?
We're discussing it now.
Oh, so no decision was actually made?
Uh, no.
A decision was made.
Now it's time for the very important discussion that follows the making of the decision.
Alan, if we had discussed this before a decision was made, I might have gently pointed out that we have children to feed and bills to pay.
Bye-bye, car.
Amy, I would never put this family at risk.
We have a little money saved up, and one day I hope to go into business for myself.
That way Eric could come work for me.
Hey!
You hear that?
I'm going to be responsible for the well-being of this family.
Bye-bye, house.
So you see, Amy, nothing to worry about.
I made a good decision.
Fine, fine.
I made one, too.
What?
What decision did you make?
Well, that if you're allowed to make a unilateral decision about something which affects this entire family, then so am I. Well, what decision are you going to make?
I don't know yet.
But one day, I will make a decision which affects this entire family because you did, and our relationship is an equal partnership, isn't it?
Yes.
But don't you worry because I'll talk it over with you afterwards.
And that's the whole sad mess I find myself in.
Wow!
And to think, you were my only rich friend.
Comfortable, never rich.
Indoor plumbing?
Rich.
Well, whatever we were, Shawn, we're not anymore.
You know, I never realized how easy I had it.
You had it easy, all right.
You, with your breakfasts in the morning, your lunches in the afternoon, your dinners at night.
Eaters!
You're eaters!
Shawn, they put the food in front of me.
That's okay, Cor.
You're my friend, and I'm going to teach you how to be poor.
Would you?
Well, it's not going to be easy.
You come from a world of many pants.
They put the pants in front of me.
Now, don't turn your back on me.
Okay, Cory.
You sound sincere.
Let me ask you one question.
When was the last time you slept inside?
Last night.
I can't work with you.
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.
Haven't seen you in a while.
Hey, you do that then, all right?
And you.
I'm not talking to you.
Okay.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
How's it going by and by?
Fine, by and by.
So, Mr. Matthews, how does it feel to be back in the old school hall?
They miss me, don't they?
Oh, yes.
We've brought in a crisis counselor to help the students deal with their loss.
Well, I think that's a great way to begin the healing process.
Oh, you weren't serious.
No.
Okay.
I take it you're here to set up a tutoring schedule.
Well, you know, I was, but now, Mr. Feeny, I really don't think tutoring's going to be necessary for me.
Now, Eric, I thought we agreed that colleges look favorably on students who acknowledge their scholastic shortcomings and try to rectify them.
Whatever.
But you know, my dad has actually decided to start a family business and has generously offered me a position within the firm, so, as you can see, my future's assured.
What kind of business is it?
I don't know, but, you know, it doesn't really matter.
Because this weekend the Matthews men are attending the "Be your own boss franchise exposition opportunity extravaganza" at the Airport Comfort Inn.
Where dreams are born.
Yeah.
Dad, somewhere out there lies our bright, shining future.
Where do you want to start?
Well, since I've been in food my whole life, I think we can eliminate everything from spaghetti-in-a-bag to Das falafel sergeant.
Well, since I've been in school my whole life, I want to eliminate anything where you have to shower with guys.
Gentlemen, I couldn't help but overhear your career consternation.
What you're looking for is something fresh, something new, a business with unlimited growth opportunity where you can be your own boss.
Does it sound good so far?
That's exactly what we're looking for.
Then let me ask you, do you have a dog?
Yes.
No!
No, we don't.
We'll get one.
Don't blow this.
We have a small dog.
According to this graph, over and every day those dogs leave behind a great deal of, shall we say, residue.
I think we've heard enough.
No!
No!
No!
Let's see where this is going.
Now, let's face it.
No one is picking up this stinky mess on our lawns, on our parks.
What to do?
Here lies the answer.
What is it?
Poo-pourri.
Poo-pourri?
Poo-pourri.
Deodorizes, sanitizes, glamorizes.
Ooh, cake!
Come on, let's go.
No.
I want to make this my life.
Gentlemen, the figures are irrefutable.
If each pet-owning American purchases only one can of poo-pourri, this franchise is worth over $40 billion, catapulting Poo-pourri Inc. to the number one corporation in America.
And if nobody buys it?
Well, now you sound like my wife!
So that's a leader so far, huh, Dad?
Uh, sadly, it is, Son.
But there are many business opportunities to consider, and I'm sure we will find exactly the right thing for us.
You want to open an Ogner's House of Strudel?
I do, and here's why.
There's they assure me that Frau Ogner comes out with a new flavor.
So now my future depends on a Bavarian named Ogner.
Shawn warned me about this.
Alan, tell me you are not buying into this strudel idea.
No, no.
Actually, this was my first choice.
Rapidmart?
What is this, a convenience store?
Yeah.
I think it makes perfect sense for someone like me.
It's a business I already know.
It's a business you already hate.
I hated working for somebody else.
This would be different.
I'd run my own store, run it my way.
You're still selling lettuce.
Alan, you know this is not what you want.
Amy, I can't seem to win with you.
You wanted to be included in the decision, so I include you, and now you're trying to talk me out of something I kind of, sort of, maybe want to do.
Oh, well, gee, with that kind of passion, who am I to stand in your way?
Hello?
Is this obvious only to me?
Strudel.
Eric, no strudel.
Fine, you're out.
Naptime.
Yeah, you're right.
Look, Amy, I looked at every possible job opportunity, and this is what I want to do because this makes the most sense.
Oh, this isn't about what makes sense.
This is about spending the rest of your life doing what you want to do.
I want to run my own store.
I want you to be happy for me.
Now, are you behind me on this or not?
No.
Fine.
Thank you for your support.
What is that, your sleeping bag?
Uh-huh.
Oh, one little disagreement, and you're walking out on me?
And I'm taking Eric.
Couple of nights under the stars, a little hiking through the woods, some fishing.
That's where I do my best thinking.
I got to try and figure out what to do with the rest of my life.
Alan, what we talked about in the kitchen, you know that I would never stand in the way of something I thought you really wanted to do.
I know that.
But this isn't about what I want to do.
This is about my responsibility to this family, and I just I just feel so helpless.
Honey, you feel helpless because you're stuck.
Alan, it's all right to take a risk.
I can't support this convenience store idea because I know you won't be happy, and I can only support your happiness.
Cory, taking part in a research study is a ridiculous way to make money.
If you need it that bad, I'll lend it to you.
Well, Shawn says I've got to learn to provide for myself.
Well, then get a real job.
Well, Shawn says I'm in no position to pay taxes right now.
These guys don't even want to know our real names.
Well, I think you guys are both lunatics.
Yeah?
Well, we'll see what you think after we get our 100 bucks.
Just for testing a new shampoo?
Yep.
You sure there's nothing to worry about?
Worry?
Cory, it's shampoo!
They only test it on humans so they can say they don't test it on animals.
Hiking, fishing, cooking our own food over a fire.
I'm telling you something, Dad, that's what we got to do with the rest of our lives.
We got to stay out there, become mountain men.
Yeah.
What do you think that pays?
Ah, the intrepid woodsmen returning to the safe harbor of suburbia.
Did you bag any trophies?
Ooh!
Boy, you bet we did.
Eric got a fish.
Dad!
Come on.
Come on.
Show him.
Come on, boy.
Oh, boy.
I imagine he'd have put up a heck of a fight.
Well, not really.
I was actually just filling up my toothbrush cup.
He just kind of swam right in there.
Hi, guys.
Hey, honey!
Oh, boy, you seem refreshed.
Did sleeping under the stars point you to a new career?
Well, I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest of my life, but nothing can give me half the satisfaction I get waking up next to that beautiful Cedar Lake.
Yes, exhilarating feeling.
Shame you can't capture it somehow and keep it on your desk, hmm?
Yeah.
You know, the only thing wrong with this weekend was that you weren't there.
Let's go up again, huh?
Next weekend.
You come, too.
Might I suggest, for the sake of communal bliss, that you outfit yourselves with one of those two-person sleeping bags that are currently on discount at Kimball's?
George, you rascal!
How do you know about those?
I go camping.
I don't fish.
You do the math.
Anyway, I was down there this morning having a talk with my old friend Ed Kimball, who's having some kind of a sale.
Why don't you pop over there and tell Ed I sent you?
I know Kimball's.
It's one of my favorite stores.
Hey, guys.
Any update on our current situation?
Actually, yes, there is.
This weekend, we're going up to the mountains.
We're going to sleep on the ground.
Oh, we've lost everything.
What are you doing?
Shawn!
You're here.
I thought you'd be doing your little puppet show downtown which always brings in the cash.
I said what are you doing?
It's not mine.
I found it.
It's not like I paid for it.
I said what are you doing?
I'm eating meat!
You disgust me, man.
But I like meat.
It's my parents' fault, Shawn.
They raised me.
They gave me an allowance.
Cory, Cory, Cory.
My dear, sweet Cory.
There's no shame.
There's two types of people in this world, people like you, who always manage to get by and people like me that are lucky enough to have people like you in their lives.
Thanks, man.
You want half?
It's how the poor survive.
Oh, Dad, this fishing rod is nothing like our fishing rod.
Well, that's a MacMillan.
Graphite 4,000 series.
Top-of-the-line, my boy.
Now, put it down, gently.
I see you know your fishing gear.
Uh, yes.
Alan Matthews.
I'm a friend of George Feeny's.
Oh, George.
Yeah, sure.
I sure enjoy our little chats.
I just wish he'd buy something once in a while.
Hey, Dad, look at these kayaks.
How cool would that be on the lake?
Oh!
Not nearly as cool as this tent.
Check this out.
"Survival-rated for winds up to 100 miles per hour.
" I'm not going.
Do you know they brought a tent just like this up to the top of Mount Everest?
I'm sure you could survive a few nights on Cedar Lake.
Boy, you got all the best toys here.
Let me show you the new catalog and see what's coming.
Thank you for indulging my husband.
He really loves your store.
Oh, I can see that, and it looks like your kids do, too.
Hey, I can see men's sportswear from here!
It's really a wonderful store.
How long have you had it?
Oh, my gosh.
Been in the family about 47 years.
I was going to leave it to my son, only I had a daughter, and she married an orthodontist and moved to Palm Beach.
So, what are you going to do?
I've got it up for sale.
I want to spend some time with my grandchildren in the south.
You know, I was just mentioning this to George Feeny the other day.
Yeah.
Feeny.
He mentioned you were having a sale.
Mr. Kimball, I know it's none of my business, but did you make a good living from this place?
Oh, well, some years are better than others.
But let me tell you something.
If looking forward to coming to work every day was any indication, then I've done very well.
I suppose you got all your buyers lined up, huh?
A few nibbles.
But, you know, this has always been a family business.
I want to keep it a family business, even if it's not my family anymore.
All right.
We're agreed.
This is the one.
Yep.
Absolutely.
I mean, this is obviously the best one that they've got.
Oh, please.
This one is clearly better.
I mean, it's got more interior wattage and luminosity.
They're exactly the same.
Which is why I plan to be an accountant.
Come on.
Well, Amy, we better get out of here before we buy up the whole store.
I already did.
Looks like my whole family likes your store.
Oh, it's not my store anymore.
What?
Your wife just bought it.
What?
Well, the man's store was up for sale, so I bought it.
You can't just do that.
Can she do that?
She just did.
Hey, listen.
I'm a reasonable man.
We came to terms.
Amy.
Look, I understand what you're trying to do, but you just can't walk into I can't what?
You owe me a big decision, buddy, one that affects this whole family.
Well, you're standing in it.
So, this is all my beef jerky?
Hey, Dad, how great is this?
I'm going to be working for you.
I'm glad you feel that way, Eric, because we're going to have to tap into your college fund for the down payment.
Hey, Dad, how great is this?
You're going to be working for me.
How about if you're partners?
That's even greater!
Amy, I don't know about this.
What's not to know?
What?
Are you afraid you're going to be happy?
It's okay?
I mean, it's okay to do this?
Alan, we give you permission to take a risk.
Now, you look around, and if you can tell me from your heart that none of this is going to make you happy, then we will walk out that door, and we will discuss something else.
Uh Uh, no.
No.
I believe the deal was that I don't get to discuss your decision, right?
Right.
Thank you.
Well, you heard the lady.
Wrap it up.
Yeah!
Now, these are accounts payable, these are accounts receivable.
It's all pretty straightforward.
You shouldn't have any problem.
Uh, yeah, I can handle that.
We'll hire someone.
Would you?
Hello, George.
Hey, George!
Welcome to our new shop.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Ah, congratulations, Alan.
Do you mind if I browse a bit?
No.
Of course.
Pick something out.
You'll be our first sale.
Not likely.
$18 for socks?
Come on, man.
They are thermal, they are double-layered, and they are fully moisture-proof.
They're $18, and they're socks.
I'm a teacher, not a heart surgeon.
Hey, Mr. Feeny, why don't I show you some snowshoes?
Now, why would I be interested in snowshoes?
There are no snowshoes!
I'm an idiot.
I mean, I don't know anything about numbers and accounts.
I'm going to bring this whole store crashing down.
We're going to end up living in a box in the park.
Well, there are some socks over there that would keep you quite warm.
Mr. Feeny, would you tutor me, please?
I got to learn how to run a business here.
Eric, you need a complete education, and that's more than learning how to do the books.
You want me to go to college, don't you?
I want you to realize that at any given time in your life, you'll be expected to know something.
Now, today it was accountancy.
Who knows what it will be tomorrow?
I want you to be prepared.
Will you prepare me?
All right, meet me at school, and we'll work out a schedule.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Feeny.
I think I will buy that pair of socks.
Oh, sure.
Wait till I sell the store, then you buy something.
Here it is, Dad.
Our first sale.
Hey!
All right!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Bye, Mom.
I gotta go.
It's my morning to open the store.
Eric, I made you a nice breakfast.
Oh, you sure did.
Hi, Mom.
Morgan, I made you eggs and toast and orange juice.
There's Tina's mom.
She has candy.
Honey, did Eric leave?
He forgot the key to the store.
Could ya just sit for five minutes?
No, no, no.
He'll think the store's closed, take the day off.
Hey, Mom.
I know, I know.
You're in a rush, and you're late, and you gotta meet Topanga.
Well, let me just make things easier for you and open the door.
Hey, attaway to think ahead.
Brenda.
Hi, Cory.
My little tiger likes his gravy, doesn't he?
Oh, Cory likes the way Brenda does it.
Ooh, she builds a nice potato mountain, and then she turns it into a horrible volcano of doom.
Oh, look at the lava running down the volcano.
Run, peas.
Hide behind the roll.
What, you don't see that?
Brenda, do you have any more cherry pie?
No, sweetie.
I'm sorry, we're all out.
Sorry.
Oops, forgot.
I accidentally hid a piece under the counter.
Looks about your size, too.
Aw, you never let me down, Brenda.
Cory, Cory, I got a major problem.
Oh, you never let me down, Shawn.
How long has it been since I've seen my mother?
You mean since she took her little vacation?
She ran away.
She ran away for a year, Cory.
Deal with it.
I have.
And you're doin' much better.
Thanks.
Now, how long has it been since I've seen my mother?
I don't know.
How long do you think it's been?
A minute.
I saw my mom, Cory.
She was right across the street at the Trailer View Motel.
She was looking through her window at our trailer.
Cory, my mom's back.
You're telling me for the last year I've traipsed across these United States searching for my long lost Virna and you find her right across the highway?
It's her, Dad.
She's been watching us.
How long she been there?
How's she look?
When's she comin' home?
I don't know.
I haven't gone over there yet.
Why not?
I'm afraid I'm gonna chase her away again.
You didn't chase her away.
You're the only reason she stayed here as long as she did.
Thanks, Dad.
Why's she over there spyin' on us?
Hey, she's probably after my secret plans.
What secret plans?
Nice try, Corky.
Guys, let's talk.
You been looking for this woman for a year, and now you've found her.
Now go get her before she leaves again.
No, no.
It's like some beautiful butterfly that sat down just for a moment on the branch next to you, and you know if you so much as breathe wrong, it'll fly away and you'll never see it again.
This is a real delicate situation.
What we need is someone who won't be thought of as a threat.
Hello.
Hello.
What?
Come on in, Cory.
I've been expecting you.
Really?
I saw you through the window crossing the turnpike.
Then you know how lucky I am to be alive.
It's nice to see you, Cory.
It's nice to see you, too.
Oh, you're growin' up real handsome.
Thanks.
Look, I'm just here to tell you on behalf of them, couple of chickens, that they miss you.
They miss you very much.
Yeah, well, I miss them, too.
Well, if they miss you, and you miss them, then why aren't you guys together?
Well, I suppose I could just go over there, and we'd all have ourselves a big emotional reunion.
We'd hug and kiss and five minutes would go by, and then where would we be?
Well, you'd be a family.
No, we'd just be together.
I left because we were three unhappy people livin' under the same tin roof.
Just bein' married doesn't make you a good husband and wife.
And just havin' a little boy doesn't make you a good father and mother.
Yeah.
I guess you have to wanna be.
I know I have no right to hope for anything because I left my family, but in that time, I learned that all I wanna be is a good wife and a good mother, but I need to know that Chet wants to be a good father, too.
Well, okay, then.
I'll I'll just go back and tell them that.
It doesn't help comin' from you.
But from my family, I need to see it happen in its own time.
Well, how long are you gonna wait here?
You're a good boy for bein' their little messenger, and if you wanna take back a message, go tell Shawn I love him, and you give him a big kiss right on the lips for me.
I'll definitely do some version of that.
Eight lanes and not one stinkin' island.
I mean, you gotta be Moses to get across that highway.
Well, Moses, is she in, or is she out?
Look, the only thing I can tell you guys is she's gonna be watchin' you from right where she is.
That's creepy.
And somewhat exciting.
So what do we do now, Dad?
Guess we stand next to the window and try to look appealing.
Where's Brenda?
She's never been sick a day in her life.
She's probably playing hooky.
Where would a lunchroom lady play hooky?
May I have your attention, please?
Please?
It is my sad duty to inform you that Brenda Hibbard, our lunchroom lady, has passed away.
Mr. Feeny, she was just here yesterday, doing the lava on my mashed potato volcano.
I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews.
Uh, may we Can we have a moment of silence in her remembrance?
Wait, wait, wait.
Mr. Feeny, aren't we going to do something here, like have an assembly or a ceremony?
No.
No, Mr. Matthews.
There's nothing planned at the moment.
Shawn.
Dad?
This looking appealing's startin' to hurt my face.
You heard what Cory said.
We just gotta wait.
Well, I don't wait well, Shawn.
In fact, nothing good comes to people who just sit and wait.
I say we go across and get her.
Now, you go around the back so she can't escape.
I'll steal her tires.
What are you doin'?
Dad, you tried to get her once.
I mean, you chased her across the country for a year and that was no good for any of us.
What do you mean any of us?
Look, it was bad enough losing Mom, but, you know, I figured at least during that time, you and I could've gotten to know each other.
Come on, Shawn.
We know each other fine.
Dad, if you knew me at all, you would've known not to leave me or at least maybe to take me with you.
Look, I made a decision that the best thing for you was to stay in school.
Besides, I called on the telephone every couple of weeks to check up on you, make sure you're all right.
Yeah.
Every 23 days like clockwork.
Hey, I was out-of-state.
Maybe Candice Bergen can make all them long distance phone calls, but I can't.
Postcard might've been nice.
Hey, am I here?
Yeah.
Am I better than a postcard?
Yeah.
Did your mother send you any postcards?
No, no postcards.
She sent me letters, though.
Yeah?
How many?
One every day she's been gone.
Get out of here.
These say that she loves me, that she thinks about me every day, and how sorry she is about leaving, and she hopes one day I'll understand.
Hello, Mr. Hunter and Mr. Hunter's son, Shawn, my schoolmate.
I come to you in hopes that you might watch my little brother, Herman.
I hope this will prove no inconvenience, as some would say I am unreliable when left on my own.
Nevertheless, I find I must venture across the Interstate to bring home a quart of milk for the tyke.
Frankie, this really isn't a good time.
I know.
It's rush hour on the Interstate, but I take my brotherly duties seriously.
If I do not outrun the trucks, here is my watch.
It is a little slow.
I hope I am not.
Godspeed.
Oh, look, Shawn, I'm sorry I didn't call you more or write you letters.
I lost my mom.
I don't think I deserve to lose my dad, too.
Shawn, I was tryin' to put the family back together again.
Mom was gone.
You and I could've been together.
We could've been a family, but you didn't want that.
Why didn't you want that, Dad?
Bye, Mom.
No time to eat.
I got to go.
I gotta catch Dad for a ride to work.
Where's Eric?
Morning.
Morgan, would you like to have some breakfast?
Sure, I'd love some.
I'm sorry, but Tina's mom gets really upset if I don't have breakfast with them.
Cory, aren't you gonna have somethin' to eat?
Mom, Brenda, the lunchroom lady, died.
Food would hurt too much right now.
Oh, the lunchroom lady died?
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I know.
I mean, all those years of serving food to kids who never appreciated her, and then she dies.
Some life, huh?
Come on in, Cory.
Hey, Cor.
Hey, look, here's when me and your mother were teachin' you to ride a two-wheeler.
So our family wasn't messed up all the time, was it, Dad?
No.
We had a Kodak moment or two.
It looks like you're riding indoors.
Oh, sure.
That's Toys "R" Us.
That's Shawn ridin' down aisle five.
We couldn't actually afford to buy a bike.
Yeah.
Money was a little short that year.
Sorry about that, Son.
Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
Fun is fun.
You guys have been up all night looking at pictures?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Boy, time really flies when you're Well, when you stick around and hang out with your son.
Hey, look.
Here's you on a bear rug.
That's your butt.
Excuse me, Mr. Undertaker, sir.
It's my first time in a funeral home and I'm a little nervous.
Could you please tell me what it is I'm supposed to do?
You're supposed to be in school, Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Feeny, you don't do that to a person.
Especially in a place like this.
Ah.
First time you've ever been in a place like this?
Yeah.
You know, I didn't even know her.
I mean, all I know is that she served us food.
And there's gotta be more to a person's life than that.
Oh, Cory, don't lightly dismiss something that meant the world to this woman.
Serving us food?
That's right.
And she loved you kids.
When anyone would ask her if she had children, she always said, "I have 900".
I mean, she didn't have any kids of her own?
Not everyone's that blessed.
But she did have a place where she was cared about, a place where she knew she belonged.
That blessing she recognized.
I, for one, will miss her.
Yeah, well, her 900 kids are gonna miss her, too.
Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Matthews?
How do you make people feel that they're wanted and they should be together if they don't recognize it?
Do you recognize it?
Yeah, I do.
Well, then, tell them, Mr. Matthews.
That's what friends are for.
Thanks.
And be careful crossing that highway.
Well, if it isn't Cory, the little go-between boy.
And what message do you carry today?
No message, Mrs. Hunter.
I'm here on my own.
Well, you're awful dressed up.
Do you intend on asking me to a picture show?
Actually I'm dressed up because I just came back from saying good-bye to someone I really cared about.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
But I guess I never really realized how much I cared about her until after she was gone.
Yeah.
Well, unfortunately, sometimes it takes leavin' to make you realize what you had.
Look, I know you left because you guys weren't a happy family, but you wouldn't have come back this far, to this place unless you felt like they were still your family waiting for you across the road.
Cory, I did the worst thing somebody can do.
I gave up and left.
Well, you know, they felt like they did the worst thing by driving you away.
Well, son, you've been back and forth between us.
What do you think?
Well, I I think Okay.
I think you can make a hole in somebody's mashed potatoes, okay?
And you can make that gravy come down just like lava, and you can do it and they'll never appreciate it, until the first day it's not there.
Hmm.
But you, Mrs. Hunter, you're so lucky because you get to come back and find out that they've learned to appreciate it now.
You think they do?
You think they want me back?
Well, I think you'll never find out until you cross that highway and knock on the door.
You know, it's dangerous crossing that highway.
I know.
But, you know, maybe once you get there, you'll be happy, so you'll just wanna stay.
Hey, Cory.
Yes, Mrs. Hunter?
Shawn's got a good friend.
Yeah, well, he's got a good mom, too.
Lucky guy.
Are you sure?
Well, how long ago?
Okay.
Thanks.
Uh-oh.
What's the matter?
Boy, I could never lie to you, so I'll just tell you the truth.
Your mama exploded.
What?
She's gone, Shawn.
She checked out of the motel this afternoon.
Lord knows where she is by now.
Will you be chasing after her?
Not this time.
I am here with a heavy heart to reveal that somebody has something he would like to return to you.
All the valuable things we have in this trailer, and you steal our shampoo?
What kind of little weird thief are you?
I am sorry for my transgression and the betrayal of your trust.
With that said, I return your "Gee, Your Hair Smells Terrific.
" You used some, didn't you?
I am shamefaced.
Come, Herman.
We have other trailers to visit.
Yes, I'm afraid we do.
Shawn, it's gonna be okay, Son.
It is?
Yeah, because you and me still got each other, and we got my secret plans.
Dad, don't start with the secret plans.
No, no, no.
All your life, I've been telling you that I had these secret plans that could make us rich.
Well, I think it's time I let you in on them.
So there really are secret plans?
Uh-huh.
And here they are.
For the rest of my life, I'm gonna be the best father you could have.
But I guess up till now, I've been keeping it a secret.
Dad?
Hmm?
Your secret's out.
Can I come in?
Hey, Dad, you mind closing up the store for me tonight?
I got a date with sweet Cinda.
Why do you talk like that?
Why can't you just say the young lady's name, Cindy?
Because her name's Cinda.
Mom, thanks for making me breakfast.
Mr. Matthews, normally, your little schemes alarm me, but I must say, with this one, you've outdone yourself.
Yeah.
I still think you take your mashed potatoes a little too seriously.
Nice work.
Well, the woman did have 900 children.
I just thought they should all get their chance to say good-bye.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}

She's scarin' all the customers away.
Would you rather have the smelly old guy who used to spit on people?
Yeah, yeah, get him.
Get him and get rid of her.
Me?
Why me?
Because we're equal partners in this business, and I'm your father, and you do what I tell you to do.
Well, as long as I know the rules.

Of course it's not done.
I mean, don't you know me at all?
Why would you send me to do something like that?
She smiled at you.
All right, look.
Take her to lunch, and ask her to take her act further down the road.
Can you handle that?
Ha!
Can I handle that?
Yeah, I can handle that.
Or fail to do so.
But I'm gonna need some money.
So can you give me some 'cause I gave her all of mine.
And as this will be the last presidential election in which you do not cast a ballot, I want this classroom to be an open forum to discuss the issues which most concern your lives.
Mr. Hunter, what issue most concerns your life?
The swimsuit issue.
How am I doin'?
Boffo, Mr. Hunter.
Mr. Matthews?
Ah, yes.
Actually, there is a pressing social matter which I feel equipped to discuss with confidence and alacrity.
Oh, well, then you have the floor, Mr. Matthews.
Nah, that used me up.
Save us, Miss Lawrence.
Well, first of all, I'd just like to say that I think Cory's really cute for tryin'.
Oh, thank you, sugar.
And that I think the biggest crisis facing this country is the breakdown of the American family.
Oh, you always gotta go after Shawn.
Well, I just think that lots of other issues, like crime and the decline in education Hey, hey, lay off me.
all have to do with how we're brought up in our homes.
Well, now, I agree with you, Miss Lawrence.
That's it.
Mr. Hunter Oh, that's it.
Shawn, you're not really upset, are you?
What, that I'm personally responsible for the breakdown of American society?
Nah, I got bigger problems.
I know.
I got problems, too.
I mean, Topanga and I were supposed to go out tonight, but it's not happening.
Well, that's good.
Now we got ourselves a rare guy's night out.
You and me.
Two guys catchin' up.
All right, I'm into that.
The boys together again.
So, it's a pretty lucky thing Topanga's babysitting tonight, huh?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You have a girlfriend who's babysitting?
Yeah, late into the night, so burgers or a movie?
Cory, there's no burger.
There's no movie.
There's just you and your girlfriend in a stranger's house.
No interruptions, alone on a couch.
Ah.
Ah.
Cory Matthews, a parent's worst nightmare.
Lock up your daughters.
The hormones will be a-flyin' tonight.
You believe me?
No, but you're very sweet.
* I got interested in music * When I saw my first Broadway show * Corinna, Corinna, talk.
Use your words.
It's okay just to talk.
Oh.
Okay.
Well, I saw Annie.
And when that little girl sang The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow, I felt like she was talking to me.
Did she maybe mention that you should write something with a little more edge?
You sound just like my uncle with the record company.
Oh, you have a record deal?
Not yet.
Uncle David says I don't have enough edge.
He seems to think I don't have enough life experience yet.
Man, that must've really put you in a bad mood, brought you down, put you in a dark place?
You have no idea what I'm talkin' about, do you?
No.
I mean, I just did what I always do, I put my feelings in a song.
* Thank you, Uncle David * For listening to my songs * And only taking two calls * And I'll try to be more edgy * But I can't right now 'cause I'm lookin' at a * Dandelion * Dandelion Now, Topanga, Billy's bedtime is And the emergency numbers are Posted next to the telephone.
And No boys.
And No boys at all.
Water guy.
Don't worry, he's not staying.
I know your rules.
No boys.
What are you doing here?
Oh, Topanga, when I said no boys, I didn't mean this kind of boy.
This is Amy and Alan's little boy.
Mmm-hmm.
Um.
Amy and Alan's dangerous little boy.
We're all dangerous in the beginning.
We'll be out late.
If you two get dozy, just take a little nap on the couch.
Very comfortable couch.
Lie down on it, you'll think you're dead.
It's wonderful.
I'm glad you came over, dangerous boy.
Why don't you get all dangerous on the couch, and I'll get us something to eat.
Okay.
All right, all right.
Cozy couch, empty house, dangerous guy Everything is working out according to plan.
What could possibly go wrong?
Can I help you with something?
You're Morgan's brother.
Uh-huh, and aren't you supposed to be in bed?
I got a Nintendo Well, why are we down here?
Billy, what are you doing up?
He's got 64-bits.
Well, he's got 9:00 bed.
Oh, Topanga, let him have five minutes.
I really wanna play.
Listen, Billy, your parents have entrusted me with your care, and I am obligated to follow the rules as they have clearly laid out.
What were you doing?
I love you?
Get to bed right now.
Can't I watch TV?
Sure.
No.
Cory!
No.
Billy, what were you thinking?
But it's the Friday night lineup.
Ooh, the Friday night lineup.
What does that have to do with anything?
The Friday night lineup, it's only the best shows on TV.
I mean, you walk into school Monday morning, and you didn't see the Friday night lineup, forget it.
You got nothin' to say.
Don't take that away from me.
I cannot believe you are undermining my authority.
I am this child's babysitter, and I take my responsibilities very seriously.
What were you doing?
I love you?
Ha.
What, you think this is funny?
No, Mistress Topanga.
I think it's the opposite of funny.
I think it's wood.
At least let me watch my favorite show.
It's on right now.
But it's 9:30.
I know you don't stay up past 9:00.
It used to be on at 8:30, but this year, they moved it to 9:30.
Those idiots.
Wait a minute.
They moved that show to 9:30.
Why?
No one knows.
Well, was it doing badly at 8:30?
No.
Why didn't they leave it alone?
They're trying to kill it.
They're trying to kill it.
Those are bad, bad people.
Cory, we have to have a little talk.
Right after the show, honey.
There will be no show.
Get to bed.
Well, that was nicely done.
Now it's just you and dangerous me on a cozy couch.
You're going home.
Well, then it's just you.
What fun could that be?
You have no idea what this is about, do you?
Yes, I do, and it happens to be a very important issue, not just to me and you, but to all men and women in relationships, both here and abroad.
You have no idea what this is about, do you?
Oh, do I ever?
Hey, Cory, you're missin' a real funny one.
The curly-headed kid keeps on digging himself in deeper and deeper.
Love that kid.
He is such a doof.
I mean, I don't know what Uncle David could've possibly meant by life experience.
I'm 18 years old.
I've been to Sleep Away Camp.
I even got on the wrong bus once.
I had a goldfish who died.
Suicide, was it?
Oh, you.
Hey * Oh, you * Oh, you * I'm glad I know you * And I'm glad you know me, too * We'll never get the flu * And go a-choo-choo-choo * Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Like, shh!
Check.
Shh.
Check.
Is there something wrong?
No.
No.
No, nothing's wrong.
I was just, um I was just looking around, and I noticed all these people were Were watching you and listening to your song, and I was afraid they were gonna steal it, and I don't know, go sell it to Andrew Lloyd Webber, who would then write a three-hour musical about your dead goldfish.
Would he call it "Goldie"?
No.
He'd call it Check!
"Check," he would call it.
You know, when I got up this morning, I had no idea that before the day was over, I'd meet someone I was gonna spend the rest of my life with and all our lives to come.
Okay, Corinna Um, I don't know how to say this, so I'm gonna choose my words very carefully.
I think you're a psycho.
I wanna get as far away from you as I possibly can.
What?
Well, I'm just not the guy for you.
I mean, you need a guy who's Who's happy and perky all the time.
You know, maybe a guy who's had part of his brain removed, and he thinks he's a bunny.
And you guys can go off and be bunnies together.
Check!
For the love of God, will someone please bring me a check!
You don't wanna see me anymore, do you?
Oh, see, it's not just that.
I wanna put you on a rocket ship and send you to the planet Flaflooga.
This has never happened to me before.
That's a minor chord.
* I would've given you my heart * I would've given up who I am * But you trampled on my soul * 'Cause you don't understand * You're shallow * You're shallow * You're shallow * Look at that shallow boy * Topanga, the lunch bell sounded, and I thought maybe you and I could grab a bite-ski at this charming little place I know called the cafeteria.
What would be the point, Cory?
Well, first, I'm gonna take a step back, and then I'm gonna tell you.
There are three points.
I'm hungry, you're my girlfriend, and it's Taco Bar Tuesday.
You would feed tacos to our child?
Our wha You and I are gonna have a child Wait a minute.
We've only kissed.
I mean, I knew I was a good kisser, but, wow.
Our future child.
The one we'd have if we got married.
Oh, that kid.
Would I feed him tacos?
Yeah.
Four for 99 cents.
He's gonna be taco crazy.
You're not getting that I'm really upset with you.
Oh, no, my precious peach.
I had that right away.
Do you know why I'm upset with you?
Yes.
Me, something I've done or haven't done or did do, but didn't do properly.
Now, with that said, taco.
You let Billy stay up last Friday night.
You'd rather be pals with our kids than a strong, responsible role model.
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.
And yet, if I may, at the risk of being argumentative, we don't have any kids.
And we're not gonna.
You know why?
'Cause we're just kissin'?
Because I believe that a family falls apart if there are not strong, authoritative role models at home.
Topanga, it wasn't our home.
It wasn't our kid.
Now, I'm sure what you're saying probably makes a lot of sense, but right now, my blood sugar level's dropping, and all I want's a little taco.
Well, if that taco is more important to you than our child, then this family has dysfunction written all over it.
Hey, Cor, taco?
I don't think I'm supposed to have one.
Eric, you know how you got this great new job with Dad, and your life's finally beginning to come together?
Yeah?
That's over.
Why?
CD player.
You got one?
Yeah, under the counter.
Let me pull out the Sounds of the Sleeping Sled Dogs.
We were walkin' by Varsity Records, and we saw them putting these in the window.
Hey, this looks just like Corinna.
Yeah, ain't that a hoot?
Wait, she put out a record?
How'd she do that so fast?
"Uncle David's Records and Tapes.
" Oh.
"Adult advisory.
Lyrics not suitable for children"?
I wonder why.
* You're shallow * You're shallow * Shallow * Look at that shallow boy * Wow, she sounds really angry.
That was the ballad.
Come on, I mean, there's two billion people in the world.
She could be angry about anything.
This could be about anybody.
Track number two.
"Eric Matthews, you're so vain, "you probably didn't know the song before this was about you.
" All signs point to you.
All right, fine.
But, I mean, this is just a vanity CD.
You know, this is something her uncle put together in a booth somewhere.
It's not like anybody's ever gonna hear this.
You're tuned in to FM-109.
Well, if you thought Alanis held a grudge, you ain't heard nothin' yet.
Her name is Corinna, and she's real angry at some pitiful creep named Eric Matthews.
This one ought to be on the charts for 20 years.
I'm famous.
Hi, honey.
It's so good to see you studying.
Oh, boy, suddenly, I have no legs.
No, no, it's not what you're thinking, Miss Dirty Mind.
It's research.
Research?
Why?
Well, because one day, Topanga's gonna be a mother, and I'm gonna be the father or the uncle, or the way I'm goin', the guy down the street with the binoculars, but I just wanna be ready for whatever it is I'm gonna be.
Why, that's good, Cory, but mostly, you learn from experience.
I mean, your dad and I weren't prepared in advance, but we did the best we could, and we ended up raising three wonderful, well-adjusted children.
Hey, now I'm a maladjusted, woman-hating loser freak.
Okay.
Two.
Corinna came out with a new song, huh?
* He's a loser freak loser freak * He's a maladjusted loser freak * He's a woman-hatin' maladjusted loser freak I can't believe you're my brother.
Ew!
* He's a loser freak loser freak This is a very difficult situation here.
I mean, Corinna's a very sweet girl with a great artistic spirit.
It'd just be wrong to crush that.
* And he doesn't like girls * 'Cause he's afraid of them * Afraid of them * I think he likes boys * If you know what I'm sayin' * Okay, this chick is toast.
Ah, Eric.
Hey, you remember that girl who was playing guitar in front of our store?
No.
Well, she's lookin' for you.
She gave me this.
Ah, she wants to meet me later.
I bet she wants to apologize.
I'm surprised you had the guts to show up.
I'm surprised you're out when the sun is up.
Mysterious vampire references from a pseudo-angry man.
Uh, what are you doin' there?
Oh, I just write things down from time to time.
So, uh, why else don't ya like me?
'Cause you're makin' my life miserable.
I just want you to cut it out.
Hmm.
Meow-meow came the sound from the whining cat.
What else you got?
Nope, that's it.
I've said my piece.
No, no, no, I know you've got lots of anger.
I mean, go ahead, yell at me, dump me, make me feel bad.
Wait a minute.
What?
You're out of material, aren't you?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Yeah.
That's why you had to see me today.
No, it isn't.
Yeah.
Uncle Dave needs some more angry songs, and you don't have 'em.
I have 'em.
I have lots of 'em.
I'm a very dark and edgy girl.
Mmm-hmm.
Maybe to the rest of the world.
But you know what I see when I look at ya?
Dandelions.
What?
Mmm-hmm.
Pretty dandelions and flowers on a sunny day.
No, I don't wanna look at the dandelions.
I'll lose my edge.
Come on, Corinna, I know your true self.
No, I'm a troubled, twisted soul.
You know nothing about me.

Well, that's somethin' for you to think about while you go to sleep.
Now, go brush your teeth.
Billy Epperson said at his house, you let him stay up late and watch TV.
Morgan, have we learned nothing from the purple duck?
You're just making me go to bed because I'm your sister.
No, no, I'm making you go to bed because I'm your brother, and I love you.
So, go to bed.
How long have you been here?
Just walked in.
Did you come over to yell at me some more?
No.
I heard you were babysitting, so I brought you some tacos.
Is this a trap?
I just figured empty house, cozy couch, dangerous me and maybe you.
Okay, but before I lower my shields here, what exactly made you change your mind?
I got to thinking about what you said about us being young and not having kids for a while, and my guess is that by the time we do, you'll be a pretty good dad.
You know, my guess is I will be, too.
You know why?
Because kids respect me.
They do.
They sort of think of me as Mr. Discipline.
So, we won't have kids.
And now we've got the latest single by that angry young lady, Corinna Collins, who's taken the country by storm.
I haven't heard this one yet.
It's called Fuzzy Wuzzy Wuv?

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Dad, you gotta kick Mom out of the store, or we're gonna go bust by Tuesday.
Put those down.
Those are rock-climbing shoes.
You are not doing any rock climbing.
A skinny little man like you?
We ain't gonna make it to Tuesday.
There is a yogurt store down the street.
Now go get yogurt.
That's where you belong.
And get strawberry.
Amy, I think the customers have their own mothers who can nag them about their rock climbing interests.
Well, you asked me to help you 'cause the store was so busy.
Honey, it's just that you've been a protective mother figure for so long, it's kind of getting in the way of what we used to call sales.
Oh, you're crazy.
Kill fish?
You're gonna kill fish?
The fish stuff is not moving, Dad.
I have sold shoes.
I have sold ties.
I've been in retail all my life.
Selling is selling.
What do you mean "technical"?
Is this for, like, water?
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Somebody stop me.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
We might as well face it, Dad.
We're in the middle of Philadelphia.
We're never gonna find anybody.
Yeah.
What we need is a Grizzly Adams mountain man who lives the outdoor life, knows this equipment, who needs a job and happens to wander in here.
Excuse me.
I just happened to wander in here looking for the yogurt shop.
I heard they was hirin' scoopers, although I know a lot less about yogurt, sprinkles and waffle cones than I do about wilderness equipment.
I am in powerful need of employment.
Yeah, it's four doors down on the left.
You can't miss it.
Much obliged.
Wait a minute!
Hold on there, young man.
You're not leaving this house till you have yourself a healthy breakfast.
Oh, Mom, there's no time.
Cory's coming by to pick me up.
Sticky bun and a Flintstone vitamin.
Ooh, Dino.
Now you sit down.
I'll just pop this in the microwave.
No.
No.
No time for that.
The boy's friend's coming by and friendship's much more nourishing than any sticky bun could ever be.
What's in the microwave, Chet?
Now, Virna, you can continue to ask me suspicious questions, or you can join in and embark on a new relationship, one based on trust and love and not goin' in that microwave.
What bills?
What are these bills doin' in the microwave?
They're from the old relationship, but we've set sail on the good ship new relationship, and nothing's gonna set that ship off course.
Hey, Mr. Hunter, Mrs. Hunter.
Boy, it sure is nice to see you back together, a whole family again in happy domestic bliss.
Well, aren't you sweet.
If you don't want to see this entire family livin' in an Amana refrigerator box, you get your sorry act together and find some way to pay these bills!
Perhaps I should wait outside where there's a little less tension.
You spineless deadbeat, hiding the bills in the cat box.
I'll kill you.
It's first of the month in the trailer park.
Now, Virna, sugarpie, honeybunch, don't you go chewing my leg off over a minor financial fracas.
That's your new vocabulary word for today, boys, "fracas.
" Chet.
Yes, ma'am?
I have been tearing tickets every afternoon at the movie theater so we don't have to hide bills in the microwave, but pay 'em like normal people, Chet.
I want to be normal, Chet!
You know, Virna, if we're not pleased with our little job at the theater, maybe we should seek employment elsewhere.
Preferably one that gives us a little more job fulfillment.
What?
"We"?
What?
"We.
" You said "we" work.
"We" don't work!
I work!
I work like a pig!
Well, maybe you better ask for a raise 'cause we got a microwave full of bills, honey.
It's gotta be better out there.
I want to be normal, Spud.
I'm stuck.
Dad, Mom came back because she believed things would be different, so you gotta do something to show her that you've changed, that it is gonna be different.
You're talkin' about me gettin' a 9-to-5 job?
That would be different.
Well, maybe you're right, Shawny.
Maybe it's time I quit my ways of dreamin' and schemin', and settled down, got a job, and focused on reality.
That's all I'm sayin'.
'Course, we'll have to move to Portugal.
Portugal?
Why?
It's the pearl-diving capital of the world, Son.
You know, I can hold my breath underwater for over four minutes?
That should help you when she throws you off the bridge.
Dad, I'm talking about a normal job.
"We want to be normal, Chet.
" Gang up on me, why don't you?
I suppose you want me to get a job, too?
Whatever would calm everybody down's fine with me.
This isn't gonna work.
Isn't.
Is.
I think you are so immature.
Yeah.
Well, that's what it is to be a guy, honey.
That wasn't Homer Simpson.
Oh.
Sorry, kid.
I could've sworn it was him.
Wow, three at once.
Oh!
And they said it couldn't be done.
Thank you, gentlemen.
You've been great sports.
Thanks for playing our game.
Come back anytime.
Oh, very good.
Anytime you can humiliate people who are weaker or defenseless, you should certainly go for it.
All right, she got the bit.
Shawn, what a mess.
Indeed.
But now, the school janitor will have something to do, thus we have ensured his job for another day, thereby help the economy.
We are so underappreciated.
Uh, sorry about the mess here, Mr. Janitor, sir Dad?
Mr. Hunter?
Chet Hunter, educational custodial services.
Normal job for normal people.
Dad?
Yeah.
Remember mom?
Yeah.
He better.
Now then, you got your shoes, your pitons, plenty of rope, a complete grappling set, and a full harness.
Now, you're gonna need this.
And I must say, you look just dazzling.
Actually, I'm not so sure about this rock climbing.
I mean, I prefer, you know, an elevator.
Look, this ain't about rock climbing.
This is about your evolution as a human being.
What's your name?
Edgar.
And you want to be Edgar all your life?
You can get me out of it?
Eric, he's gonna kill that little man.
The guy came in because he wanted some boo-boo cream.
Ezekial sold him $700 worth of equipment.
Yes, but you see, Son, if all our customers are dead from falling off of mountains, at some point, business falls off, too.
My dad's the janitor.
Shawn, there is no shame in your father being a janitor.
My dad's the janitor.
You know, if that's what you dwell on, it's not gonna sound good.
But he could've been anything.
I mean, God!
My dad has all these wonderful dreams.
And why does he have to be a janitor here?
Everybody needs a job.
People understand that.
Hey, Hunter.
I hear our dads have a lot in common.
And you say that why?
My father's a doctor, and your father's Oh, wait.
He cleans toilets.
My mistake.
Well, that was very funny, and if you keep it up, I'm gonna punch your head off.
And then your father's gonna pick it up.
Hey, everything okay here?
'Cause if it is, we're just gonna take a little brief break for your education, okay?
Great.
Thanks.
This won't take long.
Okay, now last time, we saw how H.G. Wells paints a real bleak picture of class differences in the future.
Okay.
Above the surface, you have the Eloi living the good life.
Below the surface, living like animals, you got the Morlocks doing all the dirty work.
Speaking of your dad Speaking of head off.
Now I know there are no pictures in the book, so I thought we might take a look at the film version of The Time Machine so for one time this year, you'll know what the heck I'm talking about.
Here you go, Teach.
Thanks, Chet.
Hey, Shawn.
Was that nice man your daddy?
Shut up, Crandall.
Ignore him.
Oops, look at the mess I made.
Guess I better go get your father to clean it up.
Hey, Shawn's pappy.
Doug, why don't you do me a favor first?
Sure, Hunter.
What can I do for you?
You can bleed.
Hey, hey, hey!
Knock it off, both of you!
Knock it off!
Well, it's Mr. Hunter in my office for getting into a fight.
Let me show you my big surprised face.
Come on, Mr. Feeny, just punish me, and let's get on with our lives.
This is my life, Mr. Hunter, asking you what you've done and why you have done it.
It's nothing I did.
It's about you hiring my father to be the janitor.
My dad is picking up garbage at my school.
How could you do that to me, Mr. Feeny?
Well, now, Shawn, I never actually considered that it would be awkward having your father work here.
Hey, how would you feel?
Well If your father working here is disruptive to your education, I will certainly have to reconsider his employment.
You mean that?
You're on my side?
Frightening, isn't it?
However, rather than take sides here, I think the best course would be to throw it to you.
What do you mean?
I mean you are my student, and you have a right to decide whether you want your father to work here or not.
So it's up to me?
Yes, Mr. Hunter.
It's up to you.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
I just want to make sure that I don't make a mess.
Since when do you care whether you make a mess or not?
Oh, I don't.
I don't.
I just think that when you make a mess, somebody's gotta clean it up, and I don't want anybody to clean it up.
My dad's the janitor.
Why are you always on that?
So the toilet overflows, and Feeny asks the new janitor if he can handle it.
Guy says, "Hey, when I was with the CIA, "I mopped up after the Sandinistas.
"I think I can mop up this.
" Janitors are so colorful.
Mr. Feeny.
Yeah?
I've thought it over.
Oh, well.
That took all of five minutes.
I'm glad you gave it the time it deserved.
I think it'd be best for everybody if you just let my dad go.
Ah.
Well, it is important to look out for everybody.
So when are you gonna let him go?
It might take a few days to find a replacement.
I'll tell your father about my decision after that, all right?
Okay.
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
No trouble, Mr. Hunter.
Oh, man!
What pig ate here?
How'd I not see that?
You know, when you think about it, Cor, I'm actually doing my dad a favor.
He needs a job where he can do something important.
Yeah, I think I'm making the right decision.
Do you know there are no rock-climbing shoes left in the stockroom?
You know why?
Ezekial sold 'em.
He sold every pair of 'em.
Yes, but he sold them to people who had no business buying them at all.
If we just get past that little nagging moral issue that all those people are gonna die, we could be very successful, right, Dad?
Eric, I had a dream last night.
Skinny little men in brand-new rock-climbing shoes, falling off a mountain, screaming at me, "You sold me these, you merchant of dea " Merchant of dea?
Death.
Oh.
Look, Dad, if we weren't, you know, making stacks and stacks of money like we are, then, well, dreams like that would really bug us, wouldn't they?
Alan, Eric, terrible news from the hill country.
What, they found the bodies?
My mama's took sick.
Powerful sick?
Indeed, Eric.
And she sent word that she wants me to come home and tend to her.
Wait a second.
You can't just leave.
We don't know how to sell stuff.
Not to worry, young Eric.
I'd never leave you kind folks in the lurch.
That's why I got my brother's youngster Lonnie to come down here and take my place.
And this Lonnie has your same mountain innocence and savvy sense of retail?
No.
Dad, no.
Let me take this one, okay?
Now you lookee here, Ezekial.
We hired you, okay?
We didn't hire Lonnie.
We don't know Lonnie.
We don't want Lonnie, okay?
Why don't you tell Lonnie to go back where Lonnie came from, huh?
Hi.
I'm Lonnie.
Lonnie!
Hey, Dad, look who's here.
It's Lonnie!
So there's this kid at school, and his milk fell off his tray and went all over the floor.
Well, in the broad scheme of things, you're gonna have worse days, Son.
And then somebody came along and cleaned up that milk.
And he did this in front of all your friends?
Yeah, right in front of everybody.
I see.
Well, did he do a good job?
Did he leave the floor clean and lemony fresh?
Mom, Dad's a janitor.
He's a school janitor.
It's humiliating.
I'm sorry you feel that way because I'm so proud of him I could bust.
Mom, what's there to be proud of?
Shawn, for 20 years, we have lived on your father's stories, and those stories just used to make me angry 'cause none of them were real, but your story about your father being a janitor, that's real.
And, yeah, it makes me proud.
Well, hello there, my little nuclear family unit.
There's my wife making supper.
There's my son home from school.
The only thing missing to complete this scene of domestic regularity is Dad's first paycheck.
Well, lookee here.
And I earned it.
I really did.
What the heck was that?
There's plenty more where that came from that you probably won't recognize, either, Mr. Paycheck.
Virna, not in front of the boy.
With me chasing you around the country for a year, I ain't really had a chance to explain to young Shawny there the, well, you know, the dirtiness of life.
I'm so proud of you, Chet.
Thanks, Virna.
And I think I'm doin' a good job, too, 'cause Mr. Feeny, the principal, wants to see me in his office first thing in the morning.
Hey, kind of like father like son, huh, Shawn?
What's the matter, boy?
Dad, are you okay with this job?
I mean, it doesn't bother you to be cleaning up after other people?
Well, it ain't exactly pearl-diving in Portugal, but, well, it has this amazing benefits package.
What benefits are there to being a janitor?
Well, for one thing, after being on the road a year away from my son, what better benefit than a job that lets me be near him?
Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Hunter.
At school, early.
Well, my life's work is done.
Good-bye, everyone.
No, no, Mr. Feeny.
I'm here because Well, you haven't talked to my dad yet, have you?
No.
We have an appointment in a few minutes.
Well, if it's not too late, listen, I'd like to change my mind.
Oh, well, I don't know about that.
I've already started the process of searching for a replacement.
Well, you have to cancel it, okay?
Because you can't just do that to a guy who's finally found a steady job.
And my mom, who's been waiting all this time for him to be responsible, came to the chair and put her arm around him.
Mmm-hmm.
You have to cancel it.
Okey-dokey.
What, just like that?
I'm the principal, Mr. Hunter.
I wield great and mysterious powers.
Besides that, I was never going to fire your father in the first place.
Why not?
Because this was never about your father, Shawn.
This was always about you.
You're the kid.
You're in school.
It's always about you.
Well, what the heck was that?
I don't know.
The man just runs our lives.
All right, Shawn.
What was so important that we had to be here five minutes early?
Oh, I, uh, just wanted you to drink this milk.
All right.
I guess I could always use a little milk.
Oh, is this another one of those delightful little stunts?
Actually, Topanga, I think you're gonna like this one.
Shawn, look what you just made me do.
Yeah.
Sorry, man.
Hey, Hunter, looks like we get to start another day with your dad.
Yep, looks like we do, Doug.
Well, looks like I'm needed here.
Hold it.
Here, Dad.
Let me take care of that.
Uh, you don't have to do that, Shawn.
I know I don't.
And I know you don't, either.
Well, you know, bow-hunting takes a special kind of man.
A man who can stand his ground when a charging grizzly bear's comin' right at him.
I work for Merrill Lynch.
You'll be fine.
I must say, Ezekial, I'm a little concerned about your niece working here.
I mean, she seems like a sweet, nice girl, but she is on the attractive side and could be a distraction to a lot of young men, like, oh, say, my son!
Who has to work with her every day.
Not to worry, Mr. Matthews.
You see, Lonnetta was raised with 11 brothers, 9 male cousins, and a whole pack of bloodhound dogs.
Now, we brung her up as girlie as we could, but danged if she just didn't turn out all boy.
So, Lonnie, apparently we're going to be working together.
I think it'd be in our best interest if we took some time to get to know each other.
Oh, you mean that, Eric?
I've never been more serious about anything in my entire life.
Oh, that's mighty friendly of you.
Oh.
You like to go hunting?
Like to go fishing?
We can do some boxing.
Boxing.
Ow.
Come on, Eric.
Let's see what you got.
No.
That hurt.
Hey!
What did I say?
Come on, Eric.
Don't hold back.
Not the face.
Come on!
Yeah.
Her brothers is real glad she found work.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Look at me.
Saturday night home alone.
Next on the Food Channel, yummy chewy brownies.
I should be dating college girls, but I'm not.
And this just in to the Weather Channel.
Hurricane Chester has been downgraded from a stage 4 hurricane to a refreshing breeze.
I want to date college girls, but how?
How, I ask?
MTV's Singled Out is coming to Philadelphia.
If you want to be a contestant and meet hundreds of college girls on a very special college edition of Singled Out, then call the number on your screen.
To give your brownies even more chewiness Wait a minute.
To meet thousands of college girls, here's that number again.
See you on Singled Out.
Yes, you will.
Honey, a tonsillectomy is a really simple operation.
Yeah.
You stay overnight in the hospital, you eat Jell-O and you come home the next day.
I don't need an operation.
Then why are you talking like that?
I just irritated my tonsils brushing my teeth.
It's that darn angle toothbrush.
Shawn, tell your friend he has to go to the hospital.
I'm sorry, Topanga.
I've got some serious problems with doctors and I don't think I have to explain why.
Explain why.
Fine.
Last night I'm flipping through the channels, all right?
I'm watching CNN.
You're watching CNN?
Oh, yeah.
They suckered me in with this story about cake, but then they did an expose on a 15-year-old boy, went to the hospital for a routine procedure and vanished.
Vanished?
I want a second opinion.
Cory, you're missing the point here.
Cake!
Shawn!
You, go home.
You're scaring my son.
I'm sorry, but it's my duty to stay and protect my friend.
And I am protecting Cory from you.
You know, I could take you, Topanga.
Mail!
Mail, mail, mail!
Eric, there must be thousands of guys trying to get on Singled Out.
It probably takes them months to make a decision, get a letter out And yet, lookee here.
"To Eric Matthews from MT " I can't quite make out that last letter.
What is that?
V. V. What?
What?
How about I kill you?
Let's see here.
"Dear Eric.
Congratulations on being selected "to appear as a contestant on MTV's Singled Out.
"And please don't bring your negative, negative dad.
" What?
Let me see that.
Wow, they really put that.
Mr. Feeny, I have to talk to you.
How could you not be here?
Mr. Feeny!
Mr. Feeny!
Mr. Matthews.
What can I do for you?
I got a problem.
You're not out here gardening.
And you're not at school, you're not gardening.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.
Okay.
Look, I've been selected to be on this MTV game show Singled Out.
And I know they're gonna interview me before I go on the show and I know they're gonna ask me what college I go to.
You don't go to a college.
I know the one thing I don't want to say is Harvard.
They're gonna know I don't go to Harvard.
They're gonna think I'm so stupid because I don't know the name of some other prestigious school, so, I was wondering, could you just give me the name of the school you went to, if it still exists?
I won't do that, Mr. Matthews.
Gone, huh?
I won't be a party to this deception.
And my advice to you is think long and hard about what you're doing.
College?
Harvard.
Harvard?
Yeah.
Go, smart guys.
Tell me, if you go to Harvard, then why are you here in Philadelphia?
I go to the Philadelphia campus.
They have a Philadelphia campus?
They have six.
Stop trying to trap me.
It doesn't matter.
We chose you because of your hair.
I understand.
See you on the show tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
Daddy?
Are you leaving?
Well, only because visiting hours are over and if I stay any longer, they're gonna charge me $4500.
Well, you are my dad, and, I guess, if you're not worried, then everything's gonna be okay, huh?
Cory, there's nothing to worry about.
This is a routine procedure.
You're gonna be fine.
They won't slip and cut off my head?
This is the best hospital with the best doctors in the city.
Do you think they'd just let anybody in here?
Well, the first thing is, security around here sucks.
How'd you get in here?
Never mind me.
We gotta get you out of here.
Careful.
My intra Hey, sorry, man.
That hurt.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll take a look at that later.
But we gotta get you out of here before you start losing your whole body.
Shawn, you're starting that crazy talk again.
Ah, crazy, am I?
"Dateline, Orlando, Florida.
"A 15-year-old boy admitted to a local hospital for a routine procedure today "mysteriously vanished from the operating table.
" Shawn, I'm quite prone to nervousness.
So I would appreciate it if you didn't bring in invented stories from those idiotic supermarket tabloids, okay?
It's in New York Times, baby.
The New York Times, trailer park edition.
It's exactly the same, except you can eat it.
Shawn, you are crazy.
Dr. Hunter, Dr. Hunter, you're wanted in delivery.
Crazy, huh?
Well, this hospital doesn't seem to think so.
It's another Dr. Hunter, Shawn.
I'm going to delivery.
I tell you, Cor, no matter how many you do, it's a miracle every time.
Welcome back to our special college edition of Singled Out.
And once again, our professor of love-ology, Chris Hardwick.
Ooh, ooh.
Okay.
All right, class, close your books because today we're gonna start the semester with 50 comely co-eds who will do anything to get to the head of the class.
But, of course, only one will graduate with honors and she's going to win a date with our big man on campus.
Let's meet him.
Mr. Eric Matthews!
Take the mask off, Eric.
I'm not trying to be funny or anything, but you're a very attractive man.
It's like looking in a mirror.
No.
I don't think so.
Listen, Eric, would you like to tell the girls a little about yourself, the big Harvard man that you are.
Harvard University, ladies and gentlemen.
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a huge school.
What, Why don't we There are some students there.
Why don't we just play the game?
Oh, and he's modest, too, girls.
What a catch.
Well, Eric is a junior at Harvard University.
He currently maintains a GPA of 7.0.
Yeah, I didn't do too hot in science.
Very nice.
Science wasn't good.
Do we have to talk about this on the air?
No, we don't and we won't.
As a matter of fact, we'll go over to our board here.
Our categories are First Date, Brains, Hygiene, Age, Height and Experience.
Eric, where would you like to start?
Okay, Chris.
Why don't we start with First Date?
All right.
Very good.
Have you been naughty or have you been nice?
Hmm, well, I know my mom would want me to send away the naughty girls, but All right, then!
Have you been naughty, get out!
No!
No!
No!
Yes!
Stay!
My mom's not here!
You can be naughty.
I want to be naughty with you!
No!
Chris!
No, hi!
Hi!
I didn't mean you.
I didn't mean Hello!
Hi!
You can wait for me outside.
I can be naughty.
He tricked me!
It was Hi!
Chris, what are you doing to me?
You're a strong man, sacrificing all that just to make Mom proud.
You're sweet and sensitive, exactly the kind of guy every girl wants.
Is that not true, ladies?
Where would you like to go next?
I want to go with the naughty girls.
Well, that's not possible.
So, let's turn our attention over here and go to the board.
Okay.
Let's try Brains.
All right, Brains.
We have Einstein or Beer Stein.
All right, Chris.
You're not gonna fool me this time.
So I know if I say Beer Stein first All right, Beer Steins, get out!
No!
Yes!
No!
No, no, hi!
You can stay!
Party girls!
Hi!
Hi!
Oh, here you go.
Here you go.
Do over.
I'm sorry.
Meet me in the parking lot!
Eric, forget about them!
Oh, fine.
We've narrowed it down to our last five brainy, chaste girls, just for you, buddy.
It's bad, isn't it?
No, no, no.
Really, it's fine, it's fine.
They're exactly the kind of girls you wanted.
I mean, sweet and sensitive and intelligent and fully-clothed and We will see how bad it is for Eric when we come back right after this.
Naughty!
I meant naughty!
It's over.
Let it go.
I had naughty.
Well, here we are.
Of course, it's Singled Out, final roun and we're down to the last three girls.
There used to be 50.
Let it go, math boy.
It's not the end of the world.
Now before the show, we gave Eric a pop quiz and he wrote down some answers.
You got to try to match those.
Every time you get an answer correct, you move a step forward.
And if you get in the circle first, you get to go out with our Harvard hunk, Eric.
Harvard hunk!
Harvard hunk!
You hear that, Mr. Feeny?
Center.
Focus.
We're here.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Let's begin.
Bad kissers.
Dump 'em or train 'em?
Dump 'em!
Train 'em!
Train 'em!
What'd you say, Eric?
Well, I'm gonna take the time, Chris.
I'm gonna train 'em.
Train 'em!
A guy who listens is sensitive or picturing you naked?
Naked.
Sensitive.
Sensitive.
Eric?
Well, Chris, I was sensitive enough to write down Sensitive.
Sensitive!
This could be the final question here.
Best way to wake up?
Steamy hot cocoa for two or steamy hot shower for two?
Shower!
Shower!
Actually, cocoa.
And you were doing so well, too.
Eric, show us shower!
Well, actually, see, the thing is I kind of really like cocoa!
Okay.
Not a problem.
Stand up.
You know, the show may actually work, which completely blows my mind.
All right, Eric.
She's all the things you wanted in a girl.
She's smart, she's sweet, she's sensitive.
She likes cocoa, whatever.
And she's a sophomore at Columbia University.
Turn around and meet Lisa Thurman.
Congratulations!
Tami!
Eric, you and Lisa will enjoy a night on the town You're a junior at Harvard?
escorted in your own personal limo!
Yeah.
You go to Columbia?
Yeah.
After seeing the sights of historic Philadelphia, you'll settle into a cozy booth You like it there?
Yeah.
I like it a lot.
at one of Philadelphia's best kept secrets.
Chubbies.
Chubbies?
Oh, I love that place!
Really?
I've never been there.
Really?
Well, that's the end of the show.
Thanks for watching Singled Out.
Listen.
I just want to say, nice hair.
Hey, back at you.
Thanks, buddy.
Good luck.
Okay.
He's a great guy.
Yeah, he is.
So, uh, Chubbies.
Yeah.
It's a mild sedative.
It should relax him before we take him to OR.
Might make him a little groggy.
I'll have the soup.
What are you gonna have, King Louis?
No change yet.
Honey, they're about ready to take you in to surgery.
I'll be right here when you get back.
Sponge bath?
No.
Alan.
Amy.
George, it's very sweet of you to visit, but Cory hasn't even been in for his surgery yet.
Well, actually, I received an urgent phone call, imploring me to come down.
Feeny.
I'm here, Mr. Matthews.
Closer.
I'm close enough.
Thank you for coming.
Now, I don't have much time.
I need to make peace with you.
Sedative.
Ah!
Well, all is forgiven, Mr. Matthews.
I wish it was that simple.
I've done a lot of bad to you over the years.
I want to make things right between us.
You're making me very uncomfortable.
Ah, for once, just listen to me, man.
In the classroom under my desk is a key.
The key will open airport locker B-378.
In the locker is a tattered plaid valise.
In the valise, you will find all my homework.
For five years.
You see, all these years, I've understood everything.
I'm actually a brilliant student.
What is the capital of Montana?
You're not going to the airport, are you?
No.
Okay.
We'll see you in a couple hours.
No.
I'm vanished.
I am vanished.
"15-year-old boy vanishes during surgery.
" This is idiotic.
Not even Cory could believe this could happen to him.
This is television's hardest-hitting exploration of unexplained phenomena.
We're Not Making This Up.
And now, here is anchor Grant Steele.
During what was termed a routine tonsillectomy at a Philadelphia area hospital, Cory Matthews vanished!
Here I am with the story.
This bed is empty.
Because a 15-year-old boy is not in it.
We talked to the two grief-stricken parents.
Amy, Alan, tell us in your own grief-stricken words what happened.
Well, he was about to go into surgery.
We were looking right at him.
You were looking right at him.
We were looking right at him and he vanished.
When you say vanished, you mean He disappeared.
When you say disappeared, you mean He vanished.
How about that?
Of course he vanished.
I told him he'd vanish and he vanished.
I even know where he went.
He went where they all go.
To the fourth dimension, sometimes known as The Bottle City of Kandor.
But nobody listens to me.
They all think I'm crazy.
Are you?
Am I?
Am I crazy?
Well, I guess that's for you to decide.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta go sew this guy's head back on.
His school principal, devoted teacher and next-door neighbor, George Feeny.
Are you surprised Cory Matthews has vanished?
I can't believe it.
It's all here.
Five years of homework, just as the boy said.
And these papers are remarkable.
Such insight, such perspicacity.
How could I have doubted him?
How do you feel now, knowing that you were wrong about him all these years?
About the same.
So there you have it.
Cory Matthews, if you're out there, you're Sort of missed.
Good night, and we'll see you on the next edition of We're Not Making This Up!
You were embarrassed?
I was the one who was embarrassed.
But you seemed so confident up there.
Yeah?
You bought my confident thing?
Oh, I thought you were adorable.
The things you were saying were so cute and smart.
Well, of course you're smart, going to Harvard.
Yeah, well, you must be pretty smart yourself if you got into Columbia.
Yeah, but I never thought I'd have so much in common with a Harvard boy.
Will you forget about Harvard?
Okay.
You know, the only reason I even went on that show is because it's so hard to meet somebody like you.
Don't you meet a lot of girls in Boston?
Yeah, well, you know, I'm in class all the time.
And when I'm not in class, I'm on Singled Out and stuff, so it's really hard to meet people.
How about you?
Aren't there a lot of nice guys at Columbia?
Yeah.
There are.
What's the matter?
This would've been so much easier if you were a jerk.
What?
Eric, I'm not what you think I am.
I lied.
You lied?
You're really one of the naughty girls?
Aw!
There, I'm over it.
Now, how naughty are you?
I'm pretty naughty, Eric.
Well, I'm not here to judge.
Eric, I don't go to Columbia.
What?
I applied, but I didn't get in.
I didn't get in anywhere.
I went on Singled Out because I really wanted to date a college guy because it would make me feel better about myself.
Wow!
Where do I start?
I'm sorry.
I'll leave if you want.
No.
No, don't leave.
I'll leave.
I really should be the one leaving.
You?
I'm the pathetic townie who lied to get on a game show.
Lisa, if I held up my card, it would say exactly the same thing.
What?
I don't go to Harvard.
I mean, I did the same thing you did, but you confessed first.
You know, I wasn't even gonna confess.
I was gonna let you think that I really went to Harvard until you liked me anyway and I felt better about myself.
And then, I don't know, I'd have my parents call you and tell you I died.
Wow!
We really are compatible.
Yeah.
So, you want to cut the classes we don't have and see a movie?
I hear there's a great party at Swarthmore.
Want to go?
You can get us in?
Actually, I thought you could.
Well One day I will.
Feel better now, Cory?
I'm completely recovered, darling.
They might've taken out my tonsils, but they could never take out my love for you.
So, what do you got, soup?
Sherbet.
Chicken and rice.
You're still a little woozy, aren't you?
I'm seeing five of you.
You feel strong enough to take a walk around the hallways?
Are you kidding?
I would walk anywhere for soup.
Cory, I picked you up some comic Cor?
Cory, where are you?
Oh, no.
It happened.
He vanished!
And I'm next.
I know way too much.
Oh, no, it's happening!
I'm starting to dematerialize.
Shawn?
Topanga and her four sisters are taking me for soup.
You want in?
Yeah.
Sure.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Shawn.
Shawn, it's me, Cory.
Cory, what are you doing here?
Well, my best friend's sick, his folks are out of town.
I just thought I'd drop by and check on you.
These bags weigh a ton.
But, you know, I just brought over a few little sundries to tide you through.
Cough syrup, aspirin.
Vaporub?
What, you didn't bring me any flowers?
Well, actually, I did.
I just didn't know if it was appropriate.
It's not.
It's not appropriate.
Now, uh, if you'll excuse me, I, um I got to get some sleep.
I'm very contagious.
Oh, say no more.
I'll just plug in the humidifier and be on my way.
Shawn.
Claire?
Shawn?
Cory.
Really, you don't have to go.
Yeah, like, I'm not embarrassed enough.
Me and my mentholatum.
You know, Shawn, if you had plans like this, you didn't have to fake a cold.
You could've just told me.
No, I couldn't have.
Why not?
Look, you're just going to have to trust me on this one, okay?
Cory, you won't tell anyone I was here, will you?
Well, normally I would've told Shawn, but he already knows.
Unless he's just a complete idiot.
You can trust him.
Come on.
Yes?
Shawn, we've always told each other everything.
Did I say there was nothing to tell?
But I Did I say there was nothing to tell?
Yes, but you still Then let it go.
Shawn, you and a girl spent the night together, without me.
Man, this is not something you sit around and talk to a friend about.
Why is that?
Because you've moved up to a higher level of intimacy with women, and I'm still walking around with my address in my pocket?
You know, don't be so hard on yourself about that one.
That's a tough address.
321.
No, no.
This is about where you are and where I'm not.
Cory, don't do anything because of me, okay?
Shawn, I've been going out with Topanga since, like, the day I was born, and all we've ever done is kiss.
I just think it's time to take it to the next step, okay?
Okay.
So what is the next step?
Hello.
May I take your coat?
Oh, you like my outfit.
What, these old things?
Hello.
May I take your coat?
Ah, you like my outfit.
What, these old things?
Hello.
May I take your coat?
I'm not wearing one.
Ah, you like my outfit.
Cory, are you okay?
What, these old things?
So what'd you want to do tonight?
Watch TV, go to a movie?
Uh, yeah.
We could go to a movie or grab a burger or go up to my room and just You know.
What would we do in your room?
Uh, have you seen my new CD changer?
I was with you when you bought it.
Yes, but you see, it's set up now, and we can go see it in my room.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
Let's go.
All right.
Yeah.
Let's go.
Cory, are you coming?
Oh, yeah, me.
What, are you having a seance?
Why would you say that?
The candles, I love candles.
The room is always like this.
Honest.
"Love Sonnets by Shelley"?
Why would you say that?
Poetry, I love poetry, and Shelley, her use of romantic imagery is, dare I say, sensual.
Shelley was a guy.
Eesh.
So we going to play anything on your CD changer?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Um, now, in order to get the best sound, you really should sit right about here.
On your bed?
Uh, it has nothing to do with the bed, and it has nothing It just has to do with the placement of the speakers and the placement of you on the Bed?
It just happens to be there.
Um, so, now let our musical journey begin.
* I can hold up three fingers Oh, uh, that happens to be Morgan's delightful little kiddy CD.
* Oops, where's my nose?
I love this!
I used to listen to this when I was a kid.
Yes, he's charming, and he's purple, but he's out the window.
And now for something a little more, shall we say, uh, not that.
That's really pretty.
What is it?
I don't know.
It came with my mom's Volvo.
Welcome to the safe and secure world of Volvo ownership.
Protected by a steel cage and front and side airbags.
We should get that car.
Cory?
Yeah, it's me.
What exactly did you think was going to happen here?
Uh, Topanga, you're talking to me like I planned this.
Cory, there's a bowl of grapes on the bed.
Why would you say that, "grapes"?
Topanga, come on, I'm trying so hard here.
To do what?
Well, I just think we're old enough.
Old enough to do what?
Well, I just think we're old enough like Shawn.
Shawn?
What does he have to do with this?
No, nothing.
Not a thing in the world.
I Look, Shawn had a girl stay over last night, and he hardly even knows her.
But you and I, we've known each other all our lives, and you're my girlfriend, and I love you, and I mean, we should be at, like, ninth base by now.
Why?
So you can keep up with your buddy?
No.
I just think my buddy had a good idea this time.
I should probably go now.
No.
You stay.
I'll go.
I'm so pathetic.
I'm throwing myself out.
Mr. Feeny.
Miss Lawrence.
Hey, Topanga.
Cory.
She's obviously very busy, what with her classes and having to go to them.
Yes, I'm sure it's nothing more than that.
What, are you blind in the eyes, man?
She hates me.
Yes, I can see there's trouble in paradise.
On a happier note, this compact disc sailed into my living room last night, and landed on my walnut credenza.
Sorry about that.
I was aiming for the moon.
Uh-huh.
Cory, normally, I don't get involved in the personal affairs of my students, but you two are just so cute together.
What can I do?
Nothing, okay?
I'm not gonna come to her, and she's not gonna come to me.
No, no, no, Cory.
Regardless of hurt feelings, it's always advisable to keep the lines of communication open.
Okay, Mr. Feeny.
You seem to know everything.
So I'll try your little communication thing.
Uh, Topanga, if what I did last night was out of line, I think at the very least, we should be able to communicate.
I don't know what to say to you.
Feeny, what else you got?
Well, on the upside, I can make everyone shake their head.
And I hope you're happy.
What?
I've blown it with Topanga, and it's on your head.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
What?
I made a move on Topanga last night, and she got all upset, like we're not supposed to be doing that, even though I told her that you had a girl spending nights at your place What, you told her about Claire?
Uh, perhaps.
Cory, you promised you wouldn't tell anyone.
I thought I could trust you.
Shawn, we're talking about Topanga No.
No, no, no.
We're talking about trust.
But you don't know what that means, do you?
Cory, it's Friday night.
Aren't you going out with Topanga?
All right, you know what this family hasn't done in a long time?
Sing.
How about Shawn?
Come on, we'll do rounds.
* Michael, row the boat ashore * Just the mommies.
What happened between you and Shawn?
Okay, just the friendless, dateless lonely boys.
* Michael, row the boat ashore * Hallelujah * Sister, help All right, all right.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, come on.
He's at that age where it could be almost anything.
I wouldn't even know how to guess.
So Shawn's rounding the bases, and you're still chuckin' peanuts up in the stands.
I ain't even gettin' peanuts.
Well, maybe you're moving too fast.
I mean, these things have gotta happen naturally.
It's naturally, Eric, for guys like Shawn and you.
You know what, you never even told me about your first time.
Remember Mitchell Davis?
There's an unexpected surprise.
Why don't you tell me about your second time?
Just stick with me.
All right, look, Mitch and I were always competing about everything.
Who could run the fastest, who could shoot the most baskets, who could catch the most flies.
Oh, please.
Get to it.
One day, Mitch shows up here.
He's got a brand new bike.
Three-speed, emerald green, speedometer on the handle.
Wait, you had one just like that.
Exactly.
That's why Mitch got his.
But see, to show me up, his didn't have any training wheels.
So, okay, I go, I begged Dad, right?
I'm begging him, "Please take off my training wheels.
" He tells me I'm not ready.
Well, apparently Mitch wasn't either, 'cause one day, we're racing down Oakhurst Drive Mmm, Dead Man's Hill.
Right.
Mitch falls off his bike, slams his head into some garbage cans, and that, my friend, is why Mitchell Davis repeated the sixth grade 11 times.
Eric, what does this possibly have to do with me and Topanga moving past kissing?
Cory, sex is like a bike without training wheels.
If you try it before you're ready, you're gonna fall off and break your head.
You know, Shawn, you don't have to always use the window.
I like it.
Danger.
Listen, I'm sorry I told Topanga about you and Claire.
You forgive me?
Yeah.
Friends for life.
You know that.
Good.
Good.
And I want you to know you can always trust me, always come to me for anything.
My parents are back in town.
Can I bring Claire here tonight?
Oh, just throw it in my face.
Cory, it's not like that.
Then what is it, Shawn?
Cory, don't you think that if I could've told you something, I would have?
Shawn, I think you know that you can always trust me with anything.
You swear you'll never tell?
I swear.
Okay, Claire and I aren't doing anything.
We never have.
The reason she's been staying at my place Her dad hits her.
What do you mean he hits her?
At night sometimes, he yells a lot and beats her up.
Wait, Claire's dad?
He's the vice president of a bank.
Yeah, I know.
Good job, fancy home, a low-life creep.
But I just can't hide her at my place anymore.
Well, we should probably go to the police.
No.
Cory, the cops aren't going to do anything.
Why not?
Because I'm a kid from a trailer park, and he's the vice president of a bank.
I mean, who do you think they're gonna listen to?
Well, then at least let me tell my parents.
I mean No!
Cory, you just swore that you wouldn't tell anyone.
I need to know.
Can I bring Claire here tonight?
What about her dad?
Won't he be upset if she's not there?
What about her mom?
Her mom's scared.
She's just pretending it's not happening, and Claire's gotten really good at sneaking out.
Yeah.
I'll call you when my parents go to sleep.
It's okay.
Uh, kitchen.
There's a bathroom in there.
You can sleep on this couch.
If you want more blankets, I'll just This is fine.
Don't worry, I'll be out before your parents get up.
Oh.
No, you don't have to do that.
Is that your mom and dad?
Yeah.
They look like nice people.
They are.
They are nice people.
I like your house.
It reminds me of my aunt's place in Vermont.
I spent a summer there once.
She had flowers everywhere.
Sounds like a great place.
You'd wake up in the morning, and even before you opened your eyes, you could smell these flowers.
You just knew that everything was all right.
So, you want me to put your coat someplace?
No, it's fine.
Really, it's okay.
I walked into my door.
I'm kind of clumsy.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that happens.
That happens to me all the time.
I must have walked into my own door like 10 times.
Shawn told you, huh?
Look, I know it's not my place to tell you what to do or anything You know, actually, could I have a glass of milk, if that's okay?
Yeah.
You know, I really think if I could tell my parents, they'd know what To do.
So, um, Claire got out before your parents woke up?
Yeah.
Your plan of protecting her one night at a time worked.
For one night, Shawn.
Good.
So, um, now it's the next night, and I'm wondering if you can leave your door unlocked again.
Shawn Cory, she likes your place.
She said she feels safe there.
Can't you just do this?
You can't just move from place to place because it feels safe.
Come here.
Did you see what that jerk did to her arm?
Now, we gotta get Claire, and we gotta go to the police.
No.
No.
Cops just make things worse.
Oh, you're right, Shawn.
You put a cherry bomb in the mailbox.
The cops came and made things worse for you.
You stole Turner's bike, more cops, more worse.
So you see my point then?
Shawn, you're a criminal.
The cops were doing their job.
Now, we're getting Claire, and we're going to the police.
If you do, I'll just lie.
Claire, you gotta do something.
Look, you come home to the people in that picture, and you know they love you.
My dad loves me, too.
He just has all this stress at work, and I get in his way at the wrong times.
Well?
No.
No.
He's wrong, okay?
What he's doing to you is wrong.
Cory.
Yeah, I'll unlock my door.
Take it easy.
I'm coming.
Cory.
It's the middle of the night.
What, didn't Claire show up?
Yeah, she showed up.
I'm fine.
It's really not as bad as it looks.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I should have been there.
He won't do this to you again.
I promise.
Shawn, you can't promise something like that.
I know you wanna do the right thing, but you have been wrong on this all the way.
Look, in a year and a half, I'll be off at college.
Until then, I'll just stay out of his way.
Claire, you haven't been doing a real good job of that so far.
You're against me now, too?
You don't deserve this.
Nobody does.
You didn't make him do this, Claire, but you can't make him stop all by yourself.
I didn't do anything to him.
I didn't do anything.
Why did he have me?
Cor, don't forget those.
Yeah, I know.
It's a good thing my parents aren't up yet, huh?
Yeah.
Good thing we're still asleep.
Yeah, we shouldn't be up for an hour.
Mom, Dad, it's nice to see you both.
Yeah, anything we need to know about before we wake up?
Well, first off, it's got nothing to do with these.
Cory.
We were taking care of a friend who was being roughed up by her dad.
Claire Ferguson?
You told them?
No.
This time, no.
No, he didn't tell us, Shawn.
She left her schoolbook here.
She wanted us to keep it a secret.
We decided to respect that.
Hey, guys, if you've got a friend in serious trouble, then the only thing you have to respect is how to get her the right kind of help.
Oh, we took care of that.
Did you?
Did you call the police?
No.
We put Claire on a bus to Vermont.
She's gonna stay with her aunt who lives there.
It's a real nice place, Dad, with flowers, and it's where she wants to be.
So we did the right thing.
Really?
What's gonna stop her dad from bringing her back?
He's not gonna do that.
Well, who's gonna stop him?
Are you gonna stop him, Shawn?
Is her aunt gonna stop him?
Because the distance is not gonna be what stops him.
I'm gonna stop him.
How?
I'm going to the police.
Good.
We'll drive you.
I promised Claire I'd take care of her.
Well, now you really are.
It looks really pretty there.
Yeah.
Claire says she's really happy in Vermont.
I mean, she's started a new school.
She's making new friends.
Her dad's in a therapy program, and she says maybe they'll see each other again someday.
I hope everything works out for her.
Yeah.
So, why's your house so quiet tonight?
Oh, well, Mom and Dad are at Morgan's soccer game, and Eric's at the store.
And here we are again.
Alone in your bedroom.
Yeah, but if you notice, there are no candles.
What about the grapes?
Well, I just like grapes.
Anyway, listen, Topanga, this thing with Claire, I mean, she had to grow up so fast.
I know.
I just like being 15, here with you.
Just kissing?
Yeah.
Kissing's good.
And I want you to know I would never want to abuse our relationship.
What was that for?
Hey, just 'cause we're not going to ninth base doesn't mean we can't take a little lead off of first.
Lead off of first?
Uh, baseball been berry, berry good to me.
* I can hold up three fingers * I can hold up five toes * I can hold up eight fingers *
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
" and in the night, he searches, "and in the day, he searches, "and on the morrow, he will search, "close, reaching, yet it will not be found, "and he knows that.
" Nice passion, Matthews.
Very nice.
Hey, Hunter.
Hey, how were you affected by that reading?
I don't wanna go to school, Daddy.
Cory's reading poetry.
You get your butt out of that bed and get to class!
Okay.
Okay.
Gee, I wonder what's gonna happen.
Frankie, do it, buddy.
What the poet is saying in this beautiful piece, which was very movingly read, I might add Hey.
is that sometimes we love, and though it seems the object of our love is within reach, it does not reciprocate, and so we must keep reaching.
It's not about a doggy?
Shh, honey, don't speak.
Outstanding, Stecchino, outstanding.
Anything else?
Yes.
Thank you.
Uh, Frankie, why the sad puss, o King of Poetry?
I'm afraid that the poem you so eloquently read Hey.
about someone who reaches out for an unattainable love hits a little too closely to home.
Why, Francis Albert Stecchino, have you been struck by Cupid's arrow?
Alas, there are deep and turbulent waters within my soul.
I don't know where I am.
Sit, darling.
Have a nap.
Hey, Stecchino, you're doing a heck of a job in class, buddy.
Can you save these two guys?
Uh, Frankie, Frankie, you know, it sounds like we have the basis for a little negotiation here.
I'm listening.
You help us with poetry, and we will help you with your love situation.
Let me consider.
Okay.
The conditions for your deal have been accepted.
Good.
So, Frankie, who's the girl that's doing the damage?
I will tell you, but not here, and not now.
Now, Frankie, how can we help you if you won't tell us who it is?
Frankie, I'm home.
Father, it is good to see you.
May I show you my most recent addition to the Norton Anthology Collection of Modern Poetry?
You and that poetry.
You could've been somebody.
You could've been a sumo.
I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Me and your brother Herman were at the gym.
He's gonna be a wrestler like his father.
Woof!
Yes.
I will carry on the Stecchino wrestling tradition, although my barking must improve.
Woof, woof.
He said "woof.
" Isn't that cute?
I remember you, little man.
You're in my son's poetry class.
You're a bad influence.
I should crush you like garlic and put you in my spaghetti.
That's what you said to Psycho Sid at The Spectrum the night you power-bombed him through the mat.
You were there?
I never miss a match.
You see, Frankie?
This boy's a fan.
I like this boy!
Why can't you be this boy?
Woof!
Woof!
Woof!
Woof!
Woof!
And yet, I love you, Father.
Oh, my gosh, Cory!
I just realized who it is that Frankie loves and who doesn't love him back.
Yeah, me, too.
Amy Lee Reynolds.
Yeah.
Amy Lee Reynolds.
Come here.
It's his father.
"Someone is turning sweet 16, "and if you could be there, it would be keen.
" My mom wrote that.
It's silly.
It's dumb.
I can't believe it.
A sweet I'm sorry you even have to read this.
Topanga.
Yes, Cory?
Slow down, honey.
Separate your words.
Okay, I'll try.
Please come to my sweet 16.
It doesn't mean a lot to me, but it means a lot to my mom.
So what do I tell my mother?
Am I your boyfriend?
Yes, you are.
Then I'll be there.
You're the best.
Yeah, when I'm on my game, no one can touch me.
Gentlemen, the key to any poem is to put yourself in the mind of the poet, a quiet place.
A reflective place.
It's time!
It's time!
It's Vader time!
I got it!
I got my rematch with Jake the Snake, and the chump's goin' down!
Woof!
A place where you can see what the poet sees, where you can feel what the poet feels.
Wait a minute, Frankie.
Why don't you do that with your father?
You know, see what he sees.
Feel what he feels.
My father is not a poet.
He is a professional wrestler, villain category, with the World Wrestling Federation.
No, Frankie.
Talk to him about what he loves.
You mean my brother Herman?
No, I was talking about wrestling.
Yeah, we'll even help you, okay?
Your gesture of friendship is very moving.
Okay.
Okay, here he comes.
His famous move is called the Vader Bomb.
Tell him he's setting it up too slowly.
Dad, I have a wrestling notion.
You have a wrestling tip for me?
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
I think the Vader Bomb would be best achieved if it were set up What, slower, quicker, what?
Quicker.
Quicker.
I knew something was wrong with the bomb.
You keep those tips coming.
I want you ringside at the fight.
Good boy, Frankie.
Good boy!
Can I hug you guys now?
Sure.
Sure.
Hey.
If it looks like I got a spring in my step, it's because I do, and I have you to thank for it.
I'm starting to win the love of my father.
We talk about wrestling, sure, but at least we talk.
No charge, Frankie.
So, I'll see you tomorrow night?
Tomorrow night it is.
Cory, you don't got tomorrow night.
Uh, Frankie, wait, wait.
What exactly is tomorrow night?
The most important night of my life.
See you then.
What specifically, Frankie?
It is when my father fights Jake "The Snake" Roberts.
The winner is in line for a shot at the belt against Shawn Michaels at Madison Square Garden.
He wants me at ringside to give him tips.
That means I need someone like you at my side to give me tips.
Someone like me, but not me, since I have Topanga's 16th birthday party to go to, which means nothing at all to her, except everything in the world if you listen closely, but I can't make it.
Sorry, bud.
Hey, I know very little about wrestling, except when I'm playing Twister with the McClusky triplets.
I walk alone.
Alone I walk.
No father among me.
Without a father, I am.
I'll be there.
I know.
You wanna know why I know?
Because I want everybody to love me?
I've noticed that, but I was gonna say it's because you have a good heart.
Topanga is gonna kill you.
Shawn, you underestimate her.
She's gonna want you at that party, man.
Women aren't forgiving about that kind of thing.
Okay, Topanga will forgive.
I mean, Topanga's not just any woman here.
I bet you a buck she flips out.
It's your money, Leroy.
Uh, Topanga, sweetheart, listen.
There might be a slight chance I won't be able to come I'll just die!
I'll just die!
Cory, I know I said it's not important, but it means everything.
I only turn 16 once.
Cory, you have to be there.
We have to dance at the party together.
My parents danced together at my mom's sweet 16, so we have to, too.
Topanga, am I your boyfriend?
Yes, you are.
Then I'll be there.
I know you will, and you wanna know why I know?
Because I've got a good heart?
I was going to say because you wanted everyone to love you, but, yeah, because you have a good heart.
Why do these kinds of things always happen to me?
'Cause you're a good guy, Cory.
These things happen to good guys.
That's very nice of you to say, Shawn, but I'd better be real good to be two places at once.
It must and will be done.
Oh, you have the technology?
Right here, right now.
Cory, the need to be in two places at once is a dilemma that dates back thousands of years.
Lucky for you, I am a student in such matters.
So what's this, an instructional Deepak Chopra, Venus and Mars, buy real estate no money down, Ab Reducer, Juice Tiger kind of thing?
It's The Flintstones.
I was gonna say that.
This is a classic episode where Fred has to be at Pebbles' birthday party and the big bash at the Water Buffalo Lodge on the same night.
Oh.
I remember being very nervous during this one.
Yes, quite a dilemma for our prehistoric friend.
Let's watch.
All right.
Fred Flintstone.
Nice guy, big feet, just like you.
And he's got a good best friend.
That's right, Barney.
That's me.
Watch Fred's technique.
Let's go frame by frame.
Here he is, backing out of the Water Buffalo Lodge.
Now, he's taking off his Water Buffalo helmet.
That's key.
Huh.
A simple costume change, and he fools everybody.
Now here, he arrives at Pebbles' birthday party correctly attired, and no one's the wiser.
I've calculated your distances.
The Flintstone scenario is doable in your case.
I assume you had a fallback plan.
Jonny Quest, but then you would need Hadji and a hovercraft.
Okay, Topanga's sweet 16 is a mere three-tenths of a mile away from Vader's wrestling match.
All right.
What's our time constraints?
I'm on that, too.
Fred never spent more than Yeah, but you see, Shawn, that was a cartoon.
Time was compressed.
We're real.
We're in real time.
Trust me, it's the same thing.
No, it's not.
You see, a television show can cover many days in only one half-an-hour program.
Trust me, it's the same thing.
Okay.
Now, here comes tragedy.
Fred arrives at Pebbles' party, and he's wearing his Buffalo helmet.
Wilma gets what's going on.
Here she comes around with a frying pan, and Well, we can't let that happen, Barney.
I'm here for you, Fred.
He is the best!
He is Vader!
There he is.
There is the man, the one and only Vader!
There he is, his son right there, Frankie, along with Cory and Shawn.
They are his special advisers for this match-up because if Vader is victorious, it puts him in line for a title shot at Madison Square Garden.
Oh, yes!
Vader looks to be in tremendous form!
He is here to impress his son Frankie.
He has something to prove, and he plans on proving it tonight!
Oh, yes!
There they are in the ring.
There's Vader's son in the ring, Cory and Shawn, they are taunting Jake "The Snake" Roberts.
On the other side of the ring, Jake the Snake!
He's got the snake!
He's got the snake!
They better watch out!
Frankie, Cory, and Shawn, they don't know where to go!
Get the snake out of the ring.
The snake does not belong in the wrestling ring!
Vader wants to know who the man is.
I know who the man is.
The man is Vader!
The fans here would like to see Jake the Snake DDT Vader.
Hey, where are you going?
Uh, we forgot to buy programs.
Yeah, you can't tell the players apart without a program.
My father.
Not my father.
How hard could this be?
Topanga, there you are.
I have been looking all over for you.
I mean, I've been here for 20 minutes, and I couldn't find you because of the size of this turnout.
I mean, a person could get lost in here.
But there I go, running off at the mouth, keeping you from mingling with your interesting guests.
Well, off you go.
Mingle.
Mingle, mingle.
Seventy-five.
You know, Cory, I know I said a lot about this not meaning anything, but the truth is now that the time's here and we're about to share that special dance, I realize how important a moment like this is in our lives.
I realize that, too.
In fact Wrap it up!
The end.
Where are you going?
Uh, Topanga, your Aunt Ruthie, she's over there, and for how long no one knows.
In fact, no one knows how long any of us are gonna be here.
That was crazy.
I don't even know what I said.
Shirts?
Check.
Masks?
Check.
All right.
Let's go!
Where have you been?
Your Aunt Ruthie, she's over there.
Other place.
Uh, we had to buy Vader masks, and the people and the line What?
Give me something!
Frankie looking on.
He has to be worried.
His father's not looking too good in the ring right now against Jake the Snake.
Frankie has got to be concerned.
Their advice has not been paying off.
Jake's moving in for the DDT.
Tell your dad to counter, or he's a goner.
Watch out for the DDT, Dad!
The crowd chanting for the DDT!
They want the DDT!
Oh, but Vader counters!
It must've been the advice from Frankie!
Seventy-five!
Hey, where are you going?
Frankie, I Wrap it up!
The end.
You know, this is almost too easy, Barney.
Don't get cocky.
That's where mistakes happen, my friend.
Okay, I'm off to mix.
Cor, wait, wait, wait!
What?
Have a good time, man.
Thanks.
And take off the mask.
You're supposed to catch this stuff.
Hey, anybody could've missed that.
Where have you been?
Me?
Yes, you.
I have been back and forth across this room, must've been 20 times, looking for you.
A guy gets worried is what happens.
Cory, you're out of breath.
Looking for you, but I found you, and you're here, and now I can breathe easy.
I'm sorry.
Accepted.
See you later.
What?
Where are you going?
Uh, nowhere, because there's still the matter of that special dance that's so important to you Me Us.
I'm glad it means something to you, too, Cory.
I'll go ask the deejay.
Cory!
Cory!
I've been watching the match on that TV over there.
Jake's taken the snake out of the bag.
That means Vader's history.
Without our help, he is.
Okay, there and back, but if we don't get back before this song starts, I'm history.
* Happy birthday * Now you're sweet 16 * You are my angel Oh, no!
Vader hasn't got Your tips are not working.
My father will surely lose the match, and I will lose his love forever.
No, no.
My tips are gold, okay?
Your dad's gonna turn this match around any second.
Father!
Father, are you all right?
Give me a woof!
I've got nothing, boy.
I'm losing my shot at the belt!
This is where the beaten-up fighter looks in the crowd at the one person that can give him the inspiration to go on.
Now what do you got for me, boy?
What do you got for me, boy?
Sorry, Frankie.
I'm all out of ideas.
Father, I have no tips about pile drivers or scoop slams.
All I have is the love of a son for his father, for no matter the outcome of this match, you will always be champion of the world in my heart.
Would it be okay if I won?
Well, my friends did come all this way.
Jake!
This one's for my son!
It is only a matter of time.
Vader getting back in now with a vengeance.
Oh!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Vader!
Oh!
Vader, now pounding Jake the Snake in the corner.
Rights and lefts.
Punches to the head.
Punches to the midsection.
Jake the Snake goes down.
Vader has got the Snake in position.
He's signaling for the Vader Bomb!
Vader is signaling for the Vader Bomb!
If he hits He hits the Vader Bomb!
Three!
Here is your winner!
Here is your winner!
Vader!
Wow, this is, like, the greatest moment of my life.
No, it's not.
How's the fight going?
How'd you know?
What, you believe that?
Hi, Shawn.
I had a very nice time.
Thank you for inviting me.
How could you do this to me, Cory?
You knew how important this was.
Look, Topanga, if it helps, I'm sorry.
I mean, I ruined your party, and I know you'll never forgive me.
I guess this is where I get hit on the head with a frying pan.
Okay, what's he talking about?
Flintstones.
He had to be at two places at once.
Oh, the Water Buffalo, Pebbles episode.
And you wonder why I love this girl.
Cory, I've been sitting here since everybody left, and I've been wrestling, too.
I've been wrestling with how you could've possibly left me here alone.
And I know you, and I know you have a good reason.
Tell me your good reason, Cory.
I was helping Frankie get closer with his dad.
Looks like you did.
Look, I want you to know, I would never hurt you.
And I'm sorry we couldn't dance together in front of everyone.
In front of everyone doesn't matter.
It was just a special dance, and I wanted it to be with you.
Hey, Fred.
Yeah, Barn?
You know, if it's a special dance you want, Frankie does owe you a favor.
May I have this dance?
I thought you'd never ask.
* Now you're sweet 16 * You are my angel * You're my teenage queen Poetry in motion, huh, Frankie?
Well, I see you have an appreciation after all.
So, the two in the ring, how many rounds you think they'll go?
Those two?
Oh, they're gonna go the distance.
Now, Frankie, I accept the fact that you don't want to be a wrestler like your pappy.
I'm just happy to come down here to watch you work out.
Hey, I got a shot at the belt, and I been working on this new move.
It's called the Vader-Sault.
Could I see it?
Of course you can.
Yeah!
You know, Cory, when we dance close like this and you're holding me, I feel safe, like nothing could ever happen to me.
Topanga, I would never let anything happen to you.
Uh, move one step to your left.
All right, Dad!
Yeah, Son!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I'm sure you're all aware of the conflict in Burundi which is now spilling over into Rwanda and Uganda.
He's making these names up.
He's finally run out of stuff to teach.
The Burundian conflict centers on class differences between the poorer Hutus and the richer Tutsis.
We're gonna have to put a bag over him and drag him out of the room.
That way, we save his dignity.
Class differences, the strife between the have and the have-nots, a perennial source of misery on our planet.
Another source of misery, I expect each of you to do a paper on this topic during Thanksgiving break.
He's trying to drag us down with him.
But before we break for the holiday, I want to congratulate you all on this year's food drive.
I mean, you've shown real generosity and selflessness.
That said, this year's winners are Cory Matthews and Shawn Hunter.
Oh, yeah!
Mr. Feeny, this is so unfair.
They just keep turning in the same cans year after year.
Hey, my family gives them to the food bank, the food bank gives them to my family, my family gives them back to the food bank.
It's life in the food bank chain.
So, what'd we win, Mr. Feeny?
You've won a turkey Oh.
And a box of stuffing.
Ooh.
Ooh.
Have a wonderful holiday, and don't forget that paper.
Shawn, you can have the turkey.
I'll take stuffing.
But I want stuffing.
Well, of course you want stuffing.
Everyone wants stuffing.
Stuffing's the best part.
I'll flip you for it.
I don't want to lose.
But you might win.
But, you see, if I lose, then I don't get stuffing.
There must be a way for both of us to have stuffing.
There isn't.
There must be.
Impossible.
There's stuffing.
You either have it, or you don't, unless We get more stuffing?
No.
I'd want that, too.
What I'm getting at is that we both have stuffing together.
But it's Thanksgiving.
I gotta be with my family.
Well, me, too.
Don't you see?
That's perfect.
We can have Thanksgiving together.
But our families barely know each other.
And what better time for them to get acquainted.
Okay.
Okay.
It'll be the first Hunter-Matthews Thanksgiving dinner.
It's gonna be great.
I don't wanna.
Come on.
It's Thanksgiving, a time of thanks And giving.
It's a family holiday.
Well, the Hunters are a family, we're a family.
We can be families together.
I'll tell you one thing.
Over at the Hunters, they are absolutely delighted about having Thanksgiving with us.
Do I look delighted?
Oh, come on.
Why can't we all spend Thanksgiving together?
Because it is unnatural to mix the classes, Son.
You're tampering with the primal force of nature here.
Why?
I think getting together with the Matthews is a wonderful idea.
Have you been drinking?
I don't see anything wrong about having contact with a better class of people.
Better?
Well, now we get to it.
You are a social climber.
Say what you will, but they're coming.
Over my big, dead body.
My folks are totally up for it.
Mine, too.
It is gonna be great.
That was Virna Hunter with a little pre-Thanksgiving Day tip.
Oh, that's nice.
What did she say?
Well, apparently, there are a lot of stray animals running around the trailer park, particularly this one vicious goat, so don't wear red and don't make any jerky movements.
Oh.
Well, maybe we should wear camouflage.
That upsets the bear.
Hello, Mr. Matthews.
Out of respect, I come to you, the father of young Morgan Matthews, to discuss, shall we say, a dating situation.
Amy, call the cops.
No, no, no.
Mr. Matthews, please.
Herman.
Go ahead, Herman, just as we practiced.
Dear Matthews family, especially the father, I request the presence of Morgan Matthews for an after-dinner piece of pumpkin pie.
Word around the trailer park suggests that you will be on the premises Thanksgiving Day.
Mom, Dad, would that be okay?
That would be fine.
Come, Herman.
If we are to have a female visitor, we must tidy the trailer.
Good day to you, the Matthews.
And we look forward to seeing you on Thursday.
Oh.
A word of gentle caution We know about the goat.
Do not underestimate him.
He is wily.
Wow.
This is gonna be great.
You guys are finally gonna get to see where my best friend lives.
Oh, I left my purse in the car.
What do you need your purse for?
Well, I just don't wanna leave it in the car, okay?
Well, I don't want to leave the car in the car, but we're stuck with it, okay?
I can't believe you guys.
Just give me the keys to the car.
I'll be more than happy to go and get the purse.
And when would you be back?
Not coming back.
You know, I am never taking you guys anywhere again.
I am very surprised by this family's negative attitude.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Not here, honey.
Hold it till we get home.
Cory, purse.
Okay, look, the Hunters' trailer, it's right over there.
Ah, the one that looks like all the other ones.
Yeah, that's it.
Okay, so which one did Cory say it was?
Well, maybe it's the one with their name on it.
That says "The Unters," Dad.
Obviously, the "H" fell off during the last twister or flood or goat attack.
Uh Hi there.
You folks lost?
Uh, isn't this the Hunters' trailer?
Uh, no.
We're the Unters, like it says right there on the side.
Oh.
Well, naturally, I assumed that the "H" had fallen off.
So you think if a letter fell off my name, I wouldn't replace it?
No, no.
We're just lost.
We're just Friendly people lost.
So you aren't from around here.
We live over in Cedar Heights.
Ah, well, la-de-da.
I hear that Cedar Heights is quite the lovely neighborhood.
We're having Thanksgiving dinner with the Hunters.
The Chet Hunters?
Now, you see, they have an "H".
Yes, so we're just gonna get over there if you could just tell us where "there" is.
The Chet Hunters live right, um There.
Mmm-hmm.
So I won't be keeping you any longer because I'm sure they're really looking forward to your visit.
Okay, they're here.
Big smiles, everybody.
Hi.
How you doing?
Come on in.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Chet.
Hi.
Wow.
We were over at the Unters.
Chet, I brought you this really nice bottle of wine.
Well, thank you, Alan, but as it happens, we had a very good wine planned for this evening's festivities.
Excellent wine, whole box of it right in the refrigerator.
Oh, well, in that case, we don't need to drink this.
We'll drink yours and save this.
No, no, no, no.
If you went to the trouble of bringing us wine, the least we can do is drink yours and not ours.
You know what would be just special?
What do you say we pour both our wines in a big bowl and add some bananas and oranges and have ourselves some friendship Sangria?
Nobody wants that, Virna.
Yes, we do.
We want that.
We want bananas and oranges and tiny little pastel-colored umbrellas.
Now you go get them.
They're in the drawer.
May I serve you some hors d'oeuvres?
This is a Gruyere and pecan log with a selection of crackers.
It's one of the items I most enjoy from the good people at Hickory Farms.
Oh, I would love some.
Thank you, Virna.
Looks great.
Mmm.
I know it's not as fancy as what you would have served at your home.
No, no, it's exactly what I would have served.
No.
You're just saying that.
You would have served the port wine Cheddar in the ceramic crock.
Yeah.
Remember, you gave it to that mailman that one year for Christmas.
What?
He's not just our mailman.
He's my biological father.
But he doesn't know that I know.
I should have bought the crock.
I'm pretty sure Hickory Farms is still open.
I'll buy the crock.
Virna.
Virna.
Virna.
Right now, you're acting as daffy as your Aunt Lucy who nobody speaks of.
I just wanted tonight to go well.
Well, it can't go well if you go running off into the night like some kind of cheese-crazed banshee, now, can it?
Yes, it can.
Cheese can turn this around.
It's not about what we eat, honey.
It's about who we are.
And who they are.
And we're different.
And no amount of cheese is gonna change the fact that tonight is not gonna go well, and I told you so.
Hey.
How we all doing?
Great or really great?
Shawn, how could you let this thing fall apart before I even get here?
It's bigger than me, Cory.
It's bigger than both of us.
Okay.
Well, it's up to us to hold this thing together.
Lose the purse, and I'll take you seriously.
But it goes with my shoes.
Here you go, Mom.
Chet, is everything all right?
Oh, uh You mean Virna?
She's just having one of her bouts.
You got any female calmin' pills in that purse?
Not that I can spare.
Well, that's my lift.
Thanks for having me, seriously.
Seriously, thanks for having me.
Nobody's getting off this island, Gilligan.
Well, hey there, Luther.
What can I do you for?
We're having an emergency meeting of the Trailer Park Homeowners Association of which we strongly feel you should attend.
Kind of busy now, Luther.
You know, entertaining and all.
Emergency meeting.
We strongly feel that you should attend.
Oh.
Uh, okay.
Y'all party on.
Don't let my absence be a damper on the evening's soiree.
Now, Luther, what was so important that you had to drag me away from my guests?
Oh, my stars and garters.
Yes, Chet, it is I, Herbert.
Herbert, I hope you've simply come to wish me a happy Thanksgiving and that I've given you no cause to emerge from your deep seclusion.
Once there was a land below the freeway overpass next to the self-storage facility.
And men saw that land, and they knew that it was good and trailer-ready.
And so we gathered here with our families, hard-working men and women of a common purpose, and each family having no more or less than his neighbor.
There was no envy and there was no shame, and, so, there was peace upon this land until today, where you have brought outsiders into our midst.
Come on, Herbert.
They're really very nice people.
They are not from here, and they look down upon us, and we will not tolerate their condescension.
Oh, come on, Herbert.
I mean, I don't want to be of a different mind than the multitude, but don't you think you're pressing some emotional hot buttons just to get the people riled up?
Enough!
Jerry Springer's on.
So, get 'em out of here, Chet.
Get 'em out of here now.
I have Cheez Whiz, Rice Chex, and an olive with a pimento on it.
Please.
I told you this was a great idea.
It's an episode of COPS waiting to happen.
You know, Chet's been gone an awful long time.
Do you think there's any kind of problem?
Oh, no.
I'm sure it's nothin'.
And I would just like to apologize for my previously erratic behavior, and I just hope we can get back to our uneventful Wikki wikki Hawaiian luau.
What?
Well, I hope y'all enjoyed your dinner and thanks for coming, and, well, let's do this again next year at some neutral third-party air force base.
Dad, we haven't eaten yet.
Of course we haven't eaten.
Why, our guests have just arrived.
But this is the small talk part of the evening, so y'all talk, we'll talk.
Everybody talk, talk.
Outside.
Ah, them Hunters.
Quirky, but you gotta love 'em.
You did this to us.
I mean, I could be at home right now in my nice, comfortable house, which is built into the ground, but no, no, no.
See, you had to drag us to the center of Looneyville.
Eric, Eric, I'm sure your brother feels bad enough.
Let me talk to him.
The Cowboys, Redskins.
That's a good game I'm missing.
Alan, he's just a boy.
He meant well.
Honey, I know that Shawn is your best friend, but we never really made friends with his parents.
Yeah, but why, Mom?
I mean, just because we have more things than they do?
Because Dad makes more money than Shawn's dad?
That's why we can't sit down and have a nice meal together?
Son, you won't realize this till you grow up, but being right is not necessarily enough to change the way people feel.
I told you what would happen if you invited them "aristocats" down here, Virna.
Now we have ourselves a real situation here.
So what?
You're just gonna kick my friend's parents out?
No, I'm not gonna kick your friend's parents out.
I am, however, gonna really hurry 'em along.
Well Hello.
What are y'all doing out here, outside, where you can be seen through a scope?
Well, we're taking Morgan over to Herman's trailer.
Okay.
Okay.
That'll be fine.
Shawny, why don't you go with them and show him how we locals like to walk real low to the ground?
You know, for fun.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too.
Ready for your pie?
I I just got my turkey.
Please don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think we oughta wait for the kids?
It's a Hunter Thanksgiving tradition.
Kids don't eat, and it's time for pie.
Oh.
There goes my fork.
What's that make?
Three?
Here.
Have another.
Oh, I guess it's good to have a big 'ol bag of forks around.
Well, this time, I'm gonna try and find a sturdier one.
Or you could go easy on the one you got.
Chet, you're right.
Why waste another fork?
I'm just gonna use the little forky part of the one I got.
Chet, if our dinner guest is not comfortable with our plasticware, I think it's only right we accommodate him with a regular metal fork.
Well, heck, why don't we just give everybody a metal fork?
No, Chet.
No.
Why?
Why?
Because our forks don't match?
Our forks don't match.
Oh, you know, I remember so well that our forks and spoons didn't match when we were starting out.
Chet, Virna, clearly this isn't working.
You guys went way out of your way for us, and we really appreciate it.
I understand.
It's not personal.
Sometimes what's important to realize is some folks just don't blend together so well.
Yeah.
We should just leave it that way.
Doesn't make it anybody's fault.
I'm sure the kids will understand.
Shawn, I'm really sorry about this whole thing.
I mean, my parents have just been acting like jerks.
Yeah, well, my parents didn't exactly go out of their way to make them feel welcome.
I guess this whole thing was just a mistake.
You know, why can't they just hang out together?
Adults are not narrow-minded by nature.
They can, however, be set in their ways.
I am but a callow youth, yet it seems to me a shame they should be set in the way of disliking each other.
They come from different worlds.
Think of them as the Hutus and Tutsis, living with prejudice and hatred passed on from parent to child because it is what they've grown accustomed to.
You know, are we the only two people on this whole planet who don't know who the Hutus and Tutsis are?
You know, Cory, for once, I think our ignorance may be working for us.
What?
You mean if we knew better, we wouldn't be friends?
Yeah, so I'm glad we don't know better.
Yeah, me, too.
Well, our table is in order.
It is time to proceed with our holiday repast.
Are you guys sure this is okay?
There is always room for more at our table.
It is our Thanksgiving custom to go around the table and let each person say what they are thankful for.
Then we eat?
Then we eat.
I'm thankful for that.
Next.
More?
Okay.
Um I'm also thankful to be having Thanksgiving dinner with my brother and my sister and all my friends and that I'm taping the game.
Next.
I'm thankful for these guests and that we've been blessed with enough food to share with them.
Herman.
I'm thankful to be sitting next to this delicate blossom who has won my heart.
Dearest.
I am, for once, thankful to be sitting at the kids' table.
Shawn.
I'm thankful that you're my friend.
And I guess I'm thankful that my parents taught me to like people for who they are, even if they weren't lucky enough to be raised that way themselves.
Well, I feel about two inches tall.
Whew.
That's two inches taller than I feel.
Maybe we could all try this again.
It'd be a shame to waste all that cheese.
Hey, Luther, why don't you join us here?
We're having an emergency meeting of the human race.
Y'all have room for us?
Yeah.
There's always room for more at our table.
By and large, your papers were above-average.
Very good work.
What, don't I get mine?
Did you recycle it already?
Can't just fail me privately.
You gotta Braveheart me up here.
I simply wondered if you would mind reading your paper to the class, starting here.
Okay.
"This past week, I spent Thanksgiving "with the Hutus and the Tutsis, "which was a real surprise to me "because I live in Philadelphia, "and I thought that kind of prejudice based on class differences "only happened in undeveloped countries.
" It that enough?
I'm getting vertigo from facing this way in the room.
No, no.
Go on.
"But I discovered that even in my very own civilized country, "people can be just as undeveloped and just as cruel.
"But more importantly, and the thing that gives me hope, "is that as long as the children are educated "about the dangers of prejudice and intolerance, "then perhaps there will be a reason for Thanksgiving in the future.
" That's the best work you've ever done, Mr. Hunter.
Um C minus?
All right.
No.
A plus.
I'm as shocked as you are.
All right, Shawn.
A plus.
I'm better than you are now.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Why are all those guys talking to Shawn's girlfriend?
Well, Shawn and Jennifer broke up this morning.
Look at her.
She's already on the prowl.
Well, how's Shawn taking it?
Are you kidding?
Shawn is Shawn.
You can't keep Shawn down.
Get up, Shawn.
She dumped me.
She dumped me good.
And I didn't even see it coming.
Look what they done to my boy.
Look, Shawn, if it's any consolation, I think you can do a lot better than Jennifer Bassett.
You think so?
Uh, wait a minute, Topanga.
Have you looked at her?
Okay, so she's pretty.
She's tall.
She drives a new red convertible.
Oh, heck, I'd go out with her.
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't want to say this when you were going out with her, but if you ask me, Shawn, Jennifer Bassett is one stuck-up, conceited girl.
Do you think so?
Oh, yeah.
Nose way up in the air, and, frankly, Shawn, I'm not so sure it's her real nose.
You mean?
Plastic.
Just like her personality.
So you're really not missing out on anything.
So get up and be Shawn.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You know what I think, Jen?
I think you're conceited.
Yeah, that's right.
Conceited and stuck-up and something about your nose.
What about my nose?
Um Who said something about my nose?
Um Um So it was your best friend Cory who made you say these bad, bad things, hmm?
Like I'd ever tell you.
Cory Matthews, son of Alan and Amy, grandson of Nana and Sam.
How could you sell out my Nana?
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe there still could be something between us.
I'd be willing to give it another try.
Just as long as you're not mad at Cory.
No, Shawn.
He's your best friend.
How could I ever come between you and your best friend?
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw that.
Well, what do you think it means?
Nothing good for you.
Shawn, hey.
Listen, I was just curious.
What does it mean when a girl goes Cory, come on.
She was just being playful.
Playful like a spider when it catches a fly and sucks out its head meat?
She was upset, you know?
I mean, after all of those terrible things you said about her.
Shawn, I said them to you, to make my best friend feel better about being dumped.
May I speak freely?
I don't think that's wise.
Well, maybe I'm just not wise, but I think Jennifer, or should I say Zathrak the undead, is a stuck-up, manipulative, cold-blooded Oh, she's right behind me, anticipating my head meat, isn't she?
Hello, Cory.
All hail Zathrak.
Shawn.
You and I have been working so hard to make this relationship work, but there are some people who only want to tear us apart, so I don't think we should allow those negative presences in our lives.
Do you?
Well, now, Jennifer, I'm not quite so sure I see it that way.
Wow!
Suddenly everything is so clear.
Then you see my point?
Yes.
Yes.
You're a really good debater.
So, if you want to be my boyfriend, then I think you should tell Cory you can't see him anymore.
But we've been best friends our whole lives.
I mean, how am I just supposed to say, "Cory, you're out of my life"?
Ooh, more.
Cory, could you come here for a sec?
Oh.
Maybe this is good news.
Get up, Cory.
He dumped me.
He dumped me good.
And I thought, "Oh.
Maybe this is good news.
" Well, it's about time you kids got home.
It's almost 11:00.
I was worried sick.
I had Feeny looking for you.
I called the police.
Really?
Nah.
I didn't even know you left.
So, nice time?
Yes.
Went to the theater.
Mmm.
Big musical extravaganza?
Nope.
One-woman show.
Ahh.
Juggling?
No.
There wasn't any juggling.
She sat on a stool and told the remarkable story of her life.
Oh.
Couldn't afford a real show, huh, Dad?
Excuse me?
Thirty bucks?
You spent 30 bucks to listen to some lady on a stool?
And we weren't the only ones.
Three hundred seats at 30 bucks a pop?
That's like 300 times 30.
The show's been sold out for months.
We were lucky to get seats.
Sold out for months, huh?
Interesting.
"Eric Matthews.
Look at me.
Look at me!
A one-woman show.
" Oh, yeah.
Man.
See, for me, this would be "man.
" Yeah.
So you're writing a play?
Yep.
About you?
Yeah.
You know, let me bounce the opening off you.
Let me bounce this off you.
Nobody cares.
Oh, they'll care.
They'll care because I'm a human life.
And when you look at my human life, there's all these amazing moments that just pop out.
Landmark moments, that when you put them down on paper, they just explode right off the page.
Wake up, damn you.
Hello.
Nope.
No Dory here.
Eric, that's for me.
Thanks.
Shawn?
You're supposed to call me "Dawn.
" Why, is Jennifer there?
Dennifer!
No.
She's at the mall.
You know what?
This is ridiculous.
How can you let some girl tell you you can't see your best friend?
It's just wrong.
Do you hear me?
Wrong.
Shawn, are you there?
Yeah.
I was just listening to the sound of your voice and thinking about the old days.
I gotta see you.
No.
No.
We both know that's impossible.
Because of her?
You're gonna let her stand in the way of what we had?
Shawn, if you won't see me, then I'll come right over there and see you.
No!
No!
Don't come here.
I will not be ignored.
Okay, I'll see you, but just this once.
That's all I'm asking for.
The library, tomorrow morning, 8:00.
The library it is, then I'll step aside forever.
I want my own room.
Oh, hi, Shawn.
Jennifer, uh, how you doing?
Really.
I've been looking all over for you, but what are you doing in the library?
I'm studying.
Really.
You see?
Now that you don't spend all of that time with Cory, you're putting your free time to better use.
Who's the cinnamon bun for?
What?
What?
What?
This one here?
Yeah.
The one with the little blue bow and the "C" on it.
Right.
Right.
It's got a "C" on it.
It stands for "See, I knew you'd be here.
" Hi, Shawn.
Oh, Topanga.
Do you know Hi.
Hi.
Look, I just came from the classics section.
You know, classics.
Old favorites?
There's something there you might be interested in.
Oh, okay, thank you, Topanga.
Just going to go check out that book, then.
Shawn!
Cory.
Is that you?
No.
It's the audio book section, you moron.
Hey, I was hoping you'd come alone.
Yeah, I tried, but you-know-who wouldn't hear of it.
I think she suspects.
Hey, I understand that she's important to you.
We both knew this would happen eventually.
Getting older.
Meeting girls.
Having relationships with those girls.
Which means there's less time for Best friends.
Best friends to spend time together.
It's only natural.
Sure.
Natural.
Hey, that Cinnabon was for me, wasn't it?
Cory.
Yeah.
We gotta meet.
But where?
Paris.
That's the first place she'd look.
Well, if not Paris, then where?
Someplace no woman would ever look.
The Three Stooges.
I don't see how that would work, actually.
Well, it's simple.
We're just going to have to find stolen time to sneak off and talk about sports and stuff.
That's no life.
It's all we have left.
Shawn, you've been over here an awfully long time.
Is he here?
He?
I have no idea of any he of whom you speak.
Run.
See?
I, uh, told you he wasn't there.
Fine.
Walk me to French class?
Oh, you seem so tense.
I'll sit behind you and rub your shoulders, hmm?
Yeah.
I'd like that.
I used to sit behind him.
Mr. Feeny?
Mr. Feeny!
I'm right here, Mr. Matthews.
Oh.
Hey, I need you to do me a favor.
I need you to read this.
It's a play I wrote.
Really?
Yeah.
It's my one-man show, No, no, no.
Don't care.
No.
No, but this is all about me.
I mentioned you in it, too.
Uh, just listen.
"It's last summer.
I'm on my cross-country road trip, and " "There I was on the dusty, dirty highway.
"The hot wind howled like a kind of howling, hot, windy thing.
" Are you actually going to perform this in front of people?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I rented out that little theater on Beck street, you know, the one right above the bowling alley?
That reminds me.
I'd like you to have this complimentary ticket.
Ahh!
Gee.
Yeah.
Uh Oh, yeah.
Another thing.
If you have any friends that are, like, play types, if you could do me a favor and maybe sell 50 or 100 of these.
Really appreciate it.
$30 each?
Yeah.
Well, the matinee's I kinda pull back on my performance a little bit.
Well, I can see you've thought this through, so best of luck, and, uh Wow.
Mmm!
Company, huh?
It's adorable.
He's been at it all afternoon.
Honey, do you need some help?
Mom, I said dinner was at 6:30 sharp.
Here it is 7:02 and nowhere to be seen.
There she is.
Everything's okay.
Topanga, you have no idea how much he loves you.
We'll just get out of your way.
Sorry I'm late, Cory, but the pie took forever, and I wanted it to be perfect for your big dinner tonight.
Thanks, but I'm afraid we've both wasted our time.
He'll show up.
Yeah.
He'll show up.
In the meantime, I'll just stick my beef brochettes back in the oven until they're ruined!
Look, Cory, I've got to go to dinner with my parents, and you have got to lighten up, mister.
Aren't you going to answer that?
Oh, let him worry for a change.
Oh, who am I kidding?
Hello?
It's me.
Look, uh You're not coming.
I just can't make it tonight, man.
I see.
Is that okay?
Well, if you're asking me am I hurt, no, I'm not hurt.
It's just that Jennifer invited me to her country club.
And you couldn't very well tell her you're having dinner with me?
Cory, she found my box of Cinnabon receipts.
I told you to burn those!
I couldn't, and now she won't let me out of her sight.
Shawn, our court's open.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, too, but I'm not hurt.
He doesn't even like tennis.
Cory, look at yourself.
You're a wreck.
Don't you see, Topanga?
Shawn doesn't need me anymore.
He's got Jennifer now.
Look, Cory, when you and I first started going out, I never kept you from seeing Shawn because I understand that there's something about a best friend that no one can replace.
You understood that?
Of course.
Why would I spend the entire day baking a pie that I know I'm never going to eat?
Because you're a sweet girl.
And Shawn deserves a sweet girl, too.
A girl who understands that a best friend is part of who you are.
And if she doesn't accept your best friend, then she's really not accepting you.
Yeah.
So what do you think I should do?
I think you should forget about dinner here, clean up the kitchen, and, in about an hour, go have dinner at Chubbie's.
Why?
In about an hour.
June 24, 1978.
I Am Born.
Sadat and Begin win the Nobel prize.
John Paul "I" "I" is elected the new pope.
And a new dance craze sweeps the nation.
Remember?
Remember?
Nobody likes me.
Topanga?
You, uh, wanted to see me?
No.
Actually, there's somebody else who wanted to see you.
Well, I know you two don't get to see each other very often anymore, so I'll just wait outside.
That's some girlfriend.
I've always thought so.
So, shoot some stick?
I'll rack.
I'll break.
You know, Shawn, we used to be able to play a game of pool without the specter of the Wicked Witch of the West hanging over us.
Not that I'm saying your girlfriend's a wicked witch or anything.
No.
No, of course not.
Look, if you're going out with this girl, then there's gotta be something real nice about her.
And I just want you to be happy.
Thanks, but it's so hard to take you seriously with chalk on your nose.
Oh.
Did I get it?
Nah.
Here, let me.
Shawn, how could you do this to me?
No.
No, no, no.
This isn't Cory.
This is cake.
Well, obviously, it's not cake, the kind of cake you're used to, but I can explain.
No.
No, no.
I can't.
How did you know I was here?
I got an anonymous tip on my cell phone.
But from who?
I mean, the only one who knew we were here was Oh!
Topanga.
Yes.
It was I who made the call.
But why?
It's time she knew.
That's right, Jennifer.
Cory and Shawn have kept their relationship alive, despite your evil attempt to keep them apart.
Because, in the end, Jennifer, true friendship is stronger than the allure of a cheap kiss.
Hey!
I'm talking to you up there!
So, even though you swore you wouldn't, you've been sneaking behind my back to see him.
Yeah, I have.
Look, I don't have time for this.
I'm giving you an ultimatum.
It's him, or it's me.
Okay, what do you got?
I can't top that.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
Look, Cory's my friend, okay?
And so is Topanga.
Now, if you can't be friends with my friends, then I'm not so sure I want to be friends with you.
We can still kiss.
Consider yourself dumped, Shawn.
Did you hear me?
I said, you're dumped.
It doesn't bother me this time, Jennifer, because this time I realize I'm getting more than I'm losing.
Well, I hope you'll all be very happy together.
Yeah.
I know.
I know.
Well, gang, the good thing is things are finally back to normal.
No more secrets.
No more lies.
No more sneaking around.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We can do whatever the heck we want to do together whenever we want to do it.
So?
What do you want to do?
I don't know.
What do you want to do?
See you at school?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'll see you at school.
Okay.
I am 18 years old, and at a crossroads in my life.
Crossroads.
Transition.
I'm now 5 again.
Kindergarten, and I don't know which cubbie is mine.
Crossroads.
Nap time.
How you doing?
Oh, Mr. Feeny, why did I expect anybody to come and hear me talk about my life?
My life is meaningless.
I mean, look at this.
My own parents are sleeping through it.
Eric, in the play of your life, all your great scenes lie ahead of you.
So, you're saying, in like 30 or 40 years, I could write a play that you'd want to come and see?
No.
Tonight pretty much killed any interest I had in theater.
Mr. Feeny, you know everything.
Where does my life go from here?
Well, now, you have passion.
You have drive.
You certainly have guts.
I, frankly, can't wait to see what happens to you.
So you're not going to tell me to give up my life as an actor and go get a college education?
Eric, I told you to get a college education 10,000 times.
I don't have to tell you anymore.
And what about my life as an actor?
Get a college education.
Say, this part's pretty good.
Yeah.
Those two are great together.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I "I took the one less traveled by "And that has made all the difference" Okay.
Now, what do we take from this poem?
Yip-yip-yip-yip-yip.
Yip-yip-yip-yip-yip.
Yip-yip-yip-yip-yip.
Interesting.
In my class, Mr. Hunter handles the yipping.
Shawn!
Shawn, it's both of them.
Oh, no.
Now I don't know which class I slept through.
Mine, Hunter.
Remember, The Road Not Taken?
A remarkable poem in which the poet tells us that we make choices in life, and each choice puts us on a new road that can have a profound effect on our destinies.
How does a poem about a guy on two roads have anything to do with our lives when we can't even drive yet?
Isn't he fun?
I like to think of him as job security.
Mr. Matthews, what was your last choice in your life?
Well, I did just get a job for Christmas break.
I'm a gopher at Little Pauley's restaurant.
And I got me this soft, cushy union job down on the docks.
This year, I'll finally be able to buy nice presents for my friends and family.
All right.
I want you all to keep a journal of the choices you make over the next week.
Then I want you to write a paper on the potential of those choices to change your life.
Mr. Turner, what if my choice is to not do the assignment?
You want this one, George?
No, no.
Your class.
I get them after lunch.
Well, then you would get an "F," not get into college, spend your time hanging out at the local convenience store, waiting for them to bring in a new batch of lottery tickets.
And that would change my life how?
Hey, Lonnie, uh, this'll be your first Christmas in the city, huh?
Oh, yeah.
I'm really looking forward to it.
Of course, it won't be quite like Christmas in the mountains.
Bet it's nice up there.
Oh, yeah.
While me and my brothers are out back, cutting down a tree, Mama's in the kitchen cooking a goose, and baking pies and cookies, and everybody's all happy and warm and loving each other.
I miss them so bad, I could just cry.
Oh, that's right.
That's okay.
You just use me as your handkerchief.
And she did.
I never realized how much I missed my folks.
But now I live in the city, and there's simply no way for me to be with them this Christmas.
Yes, there is!
No, there isn't.
I will drive you there.
It's 500 miles.
Good!
Oh!
Thank you, Eric!
Who are you?
Hi.
I'm Cory Matthews.
Sam over at the bar hired me to bring people drinks and run errands part-time because I wanted to earn a little extra money Stop talking now.
Yes, sir.
What's that?
Uh, cappuccino, sirs.
Sam at the bar said I should bring you some Sam at the bar thinks he knows what I like?
I would never Sam at the bar has a tendency to run off at the mouth.
I don't like tendencies.
I don't like mouths.
You understand what I'm saying?
I do, but I'm scared.
Who made this?
Who made this?
Answer him, and choose your words carefully.
I did.
Hey, it's fantastic.
Try it and tell me if I'm wrong.
I'll tell you if you're wrong.
I'll tell you if you're wrong.
You're right!
This is good.
All right.
Well, I did take the liberty of adding a dash of cinnamon.
This is for you, kid.
Wow!
$20.
Keep slingin' them cappuccinos, maybe I come up with another 20.
Then a-slingin' I'll be, and if you gentlemen need anything I'd like you to accompany my new young bride to the beauty parlor.
You know, keep an eye on her.
Well, I don't think I can do that, sir.
Sam at the bar gave me a list of things to do.
We'll clear it with Sam.
Don't worry about Sam.
Sam.
Sam.
Shawn.
A little breakfast?
Lunch.
I'm on lunch.
It's 8:30 in the morning.
I've been working in the docks since 3 a. m. Do you know how cold it is at 3 a. m.?
Nippy?
Yeah.
Nippy.
Do you wanna watch me break my ear off?
Sit, darling.
I'll make you some hot chocolate.
I thought you said it was easy on the docks.
Well, that's what it said in the brochure.
So I show up this morning, and the wind-chill factor is, like, Jupiter, and I go up to the boss and say, and he goes, "Yeah, but you took the job.
" And I go, and he goes, "That's nice.
"Christmas presents for your friends.
" And I said, and he goes, "Oh, look.
Turkish freighter.
" And all of a sudden, in comes a Turkish freighter.
Unexpectedly?
Out of the mist it came.
That's my wonderful job, Cory, unloading the same Turkish freighter that brought in the Outbreak monkey.
Do you know something?
If I go, you go!
Now you get no cocoa!
So, how's your job?
Well, it's tough.
It's very tough, Shawn.
It's brutal.
You got a cushy job.
Yes!
Yo, coffee boy, if I might.
Watch me make 20 bucks.
Yes, sir, Mr. Fountain.
Hey.
Oh, yes, of course.
There's the other part, where I do something.
You take this envelope.
You go to the mailbox on 14th and Pine.
And make sure no one sees you.
Nobody.
Put this in there.
Okay, okay.
Now, you both know how I'm not one to ruffle feathers, but, uh, there is no mailbox at 14th and Pine.
Today, there's gonna be a mailbox on 14th and Pine.
And Mr. Fountain is never wrong about mailbox placement.
Oh, okay.
Um, once again, if I may, if you really want this mailed, you should consider putting a stamp on here, and maybe even an address.
You're a noticer, aren't you?
I noticed that you're a noticer.
Not to worry.
This envelope is definitely getting to where it's supposed to, right, sir?
Do you have any idea who you're working for?
Yeah.
Mr. Fountain and Mr. Martini and Sam.
Sam!
Why?
What's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Not a thing.
You're working for the mob.
But the nice mob.
Yeah.
Yeah, the nice mob.
Come here.
All right.
I have to quit.
I have to quit.
I can't work for the mob.
Little more cappuccino here.
Every time I try and get out, they keep draggin' me back!
Mr. Fountain Yeah, what is it?
I quit.
Okay.
You can't keep me here.
We'll miss you.
I, I don't like to be threatened.
You made a fine cup of cappuccino.
Thank you, thank you.
But I gotta go.
Bye.
Come on, let's go.
Okay, okay.
I'm coming.
Kid's a lunatic.
Look, about my friend.
Um I know sometimes he seems a little chatty, but trust me, he's a smart kid.
You don't have to worry.
Loyalty.
You're loyal to a buddy.
I like loyalty in a person.
I like it on the stand.
You do?
Hey, Lou, it looks like we got an opening for a job here.
Hey, Mr. Loyalty, are you interested in a job?
Hey, Shawny boy, you know what I got a taste for right now?
Hazelnut biscotti, sir?
That's what I was thinking.
Well, then this worked out perfectly.
Hey, Lou, did I tell you this was a good kid?
Was I right?
So, Shawn, you ever wonder we got a nice restaurant here, yet we have no customers, but we make a nice living?
I figure you do a good take-out business.
Good take-out business?
Yeah, we do a good take-out business.
Take-out business!
Take-out business!
Shawn!
Cory, what are you doing here?
No.
What are you doing here?
You should be at school.
Oh, come on, man.
Jobs like this don't come around very often.
You know that.
You worked here.
Yeah, but I quit when I found out that things weren't, you know, as the FBI would prefer.
You know, this is just a nice family restaurant in a quiet neighborhood.
Nothing's going on here.
That was a car backfiring.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like it was.
Then why are we on the ground?
'Cause it's fun, and we do everything together.
Look, Shawn, we both know a job like this cannot lead to anything good.
It doesn't lead anywhere, okay?
It's just a job for a couple days so I can buy decent presents for my friends.
Yeah.
I just worry it's gonna change you.
It's not gonna change me.
What?
What?
Never thought this Christmas I'd be driving with someone who makes the whole turnpike experience seem so alluring and voluptuous.
Eric, I don't want to alarm you, but I'm getting this powerful feeling.
Really?
Well, we are in pretty close quarters, and that cozy holiday spirit's in the air, and you are getting the full impact of my right profile.
We should stop the car.
Oh, goody.
Look, Eric, you may be less experienced about this, so whatever I say you gotta do it without question.
Good.
I've always dreamed about this.
You dreamed about the blizzard?
Wha Eric, the feeling I've been having is that there is a very big and powerful blizzard headed our way right now.
No.
No, no, no.
A blizzard?
Just a few flakes in a romantic snowflake setting.
We're trapped in an icy tomb of frozen death!
It's just 4 or 5 feet of dense pack.
Don't panic.
You're right, you're right, you're right.
I work in a wilderness store.
I sell survival equipment.
I think I know what to do.
Mark everything up 30%!
How am I doing?
You're fogging up the windows.
Now just calm yourself.
And protect you.
It is my responsibility to protect you, and protect you, I will.
I've hurt my head.
Ho ho ho, my best friend.
What's this for?
Christmas Eve's not till tomorrow night.
I know that, but I just bought you the best present I ever actually paid for, and I wanted to see your face light up like a happy little elf.
So, light up.
Light up, little elf.
It's a watch.
A very expensive watch.
Which I can't accept.
Why not?
Because of where the money comes from.
I had it engraved with your name.
"To my best friend Cory.
" Shawn, thanks.
Hey, listen, now that you finally bought your friend a nice gift, you can quit your job, right?
Cory, it's easy money.
How can I quit easy money?
Listen, I made $160 working there.
You can have that.
That's even easier money.
All you have to do is quit.
No, no.
Spend it on Topanga and your family.
I'll see you around.
Shawn, wait.
You're still gonna be here tomorrow night for Christmas Eve, right?
Yeah.
Hey, don't worry, don't worry.
That's a tradition I'd never miss.
Hey.
Yeah?
Thanks for the watch.
I appreciate it.
Not because of what it costs, but because of who it's from.
You're welcome.
He's okay.
He's just got a little knock on the head.
Hey, Mommy.
Hey, Daddy.
Oh, no.
More horsey.
More horsey.
Eric, honey, are you all right?
I thought you two were on your way up to Lonnie's folks' house.
Never made it.
Ran into a nasty squall, 4 feet of snow.
We had to stay in the car until the plow dug us out.
It was no big thing.
How did he bump his head?
Like this.
Well, you two must be starved.
I'll go warm you up some soup.
I'll get you some blankets.
So, Lonnie, how'd I save us?
Eric, I didn't wanna scare your folks, but we both nearly died back there.
Died?
When the snow fell and the temperature dropped below freezing, I wrapped my arms around you and held you as tight as I could.
No, you never did that.
I would've remembered that.
You were unconscious.
You were holding me and I was unconscious?
Mm-hmm.
You were shaking and shivering and turning all blue, so there was only one thing left to do to survive.
You ate my leg?
No, Eric.
I had to warm up your body, so I remembered the old trapper's trick.
I stripped your clothes off of you, and I stripped mine off of me, and I wrapped us both up in a tiny tight sleeping bag all naked.
But, Eric, we survived.
So what.
Lonnie, when you're surviving with someone like that, you have the common courtesy to wake them up.
You kick 'em, smack 'em, yell in their ear, "Hey, we're naked"!
Here you go, a hot bowl of soup to warm you up.
Oh, great, I'm awake for the soup.
Mr. Fountain, Mr. Martini, the place is all cleaned up, so if there's nothing else, I got a little Christmas Eve thing with my buddy.
Actually, there's one more little favor I need tonight.
Ooh, tonight's real tough for me, Mr. Fountain.
Uh Two hundred dollars.
I want you to take this box, go down the street, stand in front of the warehouse, car will come by, a guy will ask for it, you will give it to him.
He will give you an envelope.
You bring it back here.
Now you do that for us, kid, and maybe we find something a little more permanent.
How would you like that?
What are you doing here?
Come on, let's go.
You're working much too hard.
Now, we're having Christmas Eve over at my house.
Nothing you're doing here could be nearly as important, so come on.
Let's go.
I got paid for a job, and I'm gonna do it.
Ooh, loyalty.
I like that in a worthless little coffee boy who they don't care if he lives or dies.
I've never had money like that before, Cory.
It makes me feel like somebody to be able to buy nice presents for my family and friends.
Yeah, I'm sure that's a real nice feeling.
Hey, what's in the box?
I don't know what's in the box.
I have nothing to do with this box.
I am merely the box holder.
No, come on, open it up.
I wanna see what's inside.
I wanna see your face light up like a happy little elf.
Open it up, my little elf.
Cory, you know, I don't wanna spend my life in front of a convenience store waiting around for the next batch of lottery tickets.
Shawn, he was exaggerating.
Yeah, well, it rang pretty true to me.
So this is it.
This is the road you're taking.
This isn't a road, this is a box.
And as long as I don't open this box, I don't know what's in it.
There's a teddy bear in this box.
Oh, a teddy?
Okay, okay, so come over to my house, we'll put the teddy under the tree, and at the end of the night we'll play a little game called "let's guess the street value of the teddy.
" How'd this get so complicated so fast?
I don't know.
I guess that's how they get you.
They find a guy who feels like he's nowhere in his life, and they make him believe that where he should be is on a street corner holding a box in the middle of Christmas Eve.
Yeah, well, maybe this is my street.
You know, maybe no matter what I do, this is where I end up like that poem says.
No.
No, see, the poem says you have choices in your life.
And every choice you make means something.
I mean, Shawn, we're only 16 years old, and we got fooled by a couple of guys who look like our uncles.
I mean, do you see how easy it is to end up on the wrong road?
Yeah, and I knew all about them, too.
I didn't walk away.
You see, I figured I'd just get them some coffee, make some money, and get out before it got to this.
Then why are you here?
I don't know.
I guess I thought I was one of those street-smart guys.
But now, I'm a little scared.
You know, Shawn, I didn't see this coming at all.
I mean, I thought the devil was supposed to be some guy with horns and a big tail.
Cory, it's Christmas Eve.
You should be with your family.
No.
No, see, that would be the wrong choice.
See, the difference in the poem is that that guy had to choose his road alone.
So you don't think he had a best friend?
No, I guess not.
But according to this, you do.
"Two roads diverged in a wood " And I choose the one that leads back to your house.
Good.
We should probably take this back first.
Wouldn't it be funny if there really was a teddy bear in there?
Yeah.
Don't you wish life was like that?
I'm beginning to see that it's not.
Oh!
This is exactly the shirt I saw in that window and told you I wanted and made you buy it, and now I have it.
You like it?
I love it.
But I do kind of miss the surprise element.
Hey, Lonnie, there's a blizzard.
Uh-oh.
Now I'm unconscious.
Save me.
Eric, it never happened.
I made the whole thing up.
You did?
Yup, sorry.
Cute butt, though.
Okay, folks, everybody get together now.
Real close.
Look right here, into the camera.
Okay, I have set it.
Everybody smile.
Smile.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Guys, get a move on.
Eric's going to miss his flight.
Eric, you're going to Boston for the camping show.
Now, I don't want to hear from any of the suppliers that you missed meetings because you were at the hotel bar dancing on tables.
Oh!
Father, for you to even suggest that I would blow off the camping show to go party hearty in Boston, that speaks volumes about our relationship.
Eric, you forgot your book.
What book?
"How to Act Innocent When Your Father Catches You.
" Eric.
Guess I better read it again.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, honey.
Bye.
Amy, Cory, hi.
Is there a lock on this thing?
Mr. Feeny!
Too late.
I tried.
I tried.
I tried.
I tried.
I tried.
I don't get the assignment.
I want to drop economics.
Business, figures, numbers I just can't keep it in my head.
Woo-hoo.
Shawn, it's simple.
Come up with a business, pretend you're running it, and write a report.
Oh!
Now I Woo-hoo.
You see?
Now, come on, let me drop the course.
No Hunter has ever made it in business.
Why cause me agony?
Why?
I like it.
Shawn, sit down.
It's quiet time.
Amy, here are my house keys.
I really appreciate you looking after things while I'm away this weekend.
Oh, sure, George.
Now, is there a number at the hotel in case we need to reach you?
Actually, I'm staying at a lovely bed-and-breakfast.
Oh, good for you.
Living in someone else's house, eating someone else's food.
So what's that run you, like two bucks?
Actually, Shawn, a room in a nice bed-and-breakfast can go for as high as $200 a night.
Right, George?
Not this one.
$200 a night?
Wow.
I have made a list of things that have to be done Plants to water and, uh, plants that will need vitamins and plants that need to be rotated to get the morning sun.
Oh, you'll do fine.
Thank you!
Just don't kill them.
Shawn, what are you doing?
It's just a house.
No, no, no.
This is Feeny's house.
There's got to be, I don't know, some shrunken heads, some eyeballs in jars, voodoo dolls.
Now, why would he have stuff like that?
Well, he took them from me last year.
Okay.
I'm going to go jump on Feeny's bed just like I've always dreamed of.
Okay.
Oh, my history paper and a red pen!
Feeny, you fool.
"Cory, you fool.
Put down the paper and step away from my walnut credenza.
" Shawn?
It's okay.
It's okay.
Thought I saw a poster of me, but it's just a mirror.
Cory, this is like nothing you've ever dreamed of.
What?
Okay.
He's got three bedrooms, beautifully decorated, but here's the best.
Feeny's got a 6-foot round tub.
Well, the man's got to bathe.
With jets.
Oh, kooky.
You know, I think I may have an idea for my economics project.
I'm going to go get started.
Well, good for you.
I don't want to be alone in here.
Hi.
Hi.
My name is Dylan Hightower.
I'm the CEO of a mid-sized venture-capital group.
You might look for me on the cover of next month's Forb-ees.
It'll look something like this.
You're just out of high school, you work for your daddy.
This is your first convention, it's pronounced Forbes.
And what's your real name?
I'm not telling.
So, what are you drinking, mystery boy?
Uh, brewski.
Root brewski?
If that's all you can give me, sure.
It sure is, but I will do this.
Cool.
I believe you're supposed to catch the glass, Mr. Matthews.
Oh, no.
Mr. Feeny!
You're here.
What a remarkable and horrifying coincidence.
Horrifying indeed.
What are you doing in Beantown?
Hiding from you, and I failed.
Why must you stalk me so?
Sorry to burst your balloon, buster, but I'm waiting for somebody else.
Cory?
No, not Cory.
Cabernet.
I'm waiting for a special lady friend of mine to have dinner in the hotel.
Oh, Mr. Feeny, I didn't know you had somebody special in Boston.
Well, that's because I've never mentioned her to you before, Eric.
And why not?
For the same reason that you don't talk about your girlfriends to me.
It's squeamy?
Precisely.
But now that you've asked I didn't.
Elizabeth is someone I've known for 15 years, someone I care about deeply.
But she lives and works in Boston, and her teaching career is as important to her as mine is to me.
A female Feeny.
So, how often do you guys see each other?
Three or four times a year.
Every so often, one of us asks the other to give it all up and move so that we can be together.
But you never took her up on it?
Nor she me.
No.
The asking and saying no has become a bittersweet ritual between us.
This year it's my turn to pop the question.
What if she says yes?
Oh, she won't.
No, she'll just smile at me over her glass of merlot and ask, "Can't we just keep things the way they are"?
And I'll squeeze her hand gently and say, "If that's what you truly want.
" And then I'll go home.
To me and Cory.
You're killing my story.
Shawn.
What are you doing in Feeny's house without me?
Actually, I'm here to work on my school project.
You proud?
Why here?
I don't have an answer that wouldn't upset you.
Can you rotate these two plants just a little?
No, no, no.
What's your school project, Shawn?
No, don't tell me.
Yes, tell me.
Tell me, but lie.
A bed-and-breakfast.
Okay.
Okay.
Nothing to worry about here.
Mmm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
Two hundred bucks a night.
Ah!
Look at this.
You're even advertising.
Yeah, yeah, just a little sign up at the airport near duty-free.
Thorough, Shawn, incredibly thorough.
Well, look at this.
You've even got guests checked in, got their credit cards, given them names The Timmers.
Hmm, kind of cute.
Who are you?
We are the Timmers.
Of course you are.
It says so right here on your credit card.
The Timmers.
He's going to scream now.
Shawn!
Feeny left us the keys to his house.
He knows this is going to happen.
He wants this to happen.
Cory, if you're going to stay at my bed-and-breakfast, I'm going to have to ask you to keep your voice down.
The Moorparks are upstairs napping.
Ah.
Newlyweds.
They're here on the honeymoon package.
Hey!
Put that down!
We are the Timmers.
Cory, they're Dutch.
Please, allow me.
Shawn.
The Moorparks and the Timmers.
That's it, right?
Yeah, yeah, that's it.
Okay.
Hi!
We're here.
Oh, the Hecks, Arnie and Gloria, from Boca.
Well, they booked through the last-minute club.
Gloria, I said I wanted to stay in a Ritz-Carlton!
It's a bed-and-breakfast.
It's a little foofy, no?
I want to pick something.
I want to pick one time, and I like it.
It's got charm.
You understand charm?
I understand no mini-bar.
I understand no macadamias!
And I threw a few bucks to the cabbies.
That way they tell them the hotels are full and bring them right here.
Out!
Out!
I want you all out!
This is our bellhop.
He's rude and obnoxious.
I like him!
Here, boychik, put this in my room, huh?
I have to kill you now.
So where's the good shopping?
Well, why don't we ask our concierge?
Concierge?
No, not you, Topanga.
How could someone as sweet and honest as you get mixed up with one of Shawn's evil schemes?
Because of this.
Why don't I show you to your suite, and then we can map out your day.
Here, buy yourself some heels.
It's a living.
You will get caught.
We will get caught.
I said no "we.
" I said "you.
" I said no "we.
" You had the key.
You let me in.
As far as Feeny's concerned, you're the brains.
The brains?
Huh.
I rather like that.
Okay.
Just promise me this, that when Feeny gets back, he finds his house exactly as he left it.
Okay?
You have my word.
Good.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
So it's really sweet of you to wait up for your What is he, exactly?
Oh, Mr. Feeny?
He's my next-door neighbor, and he used to be my teacher, and he's real concerned about where my life is going.
What would you call that?
I'd call that a friend.
Yeah?
Feeny?
Friend?
Okay.
So listen, I get off work in 10 minutes, and you seem real nice.
How about I buy you dinner?
Well, as long as it wouldn't interfere with my loyalty to my friend.
Hey, isn't that him now?
Yeah, it would have to be, because something good was going to happen in my life.
Something really good.
Hey, he seems troubled.
Yeah, but, see, it's my first convention away from home, and dinner with a lady bartender would be Oh, I hate everything.
Hello, Eric.
Are you all right?
You know, every year I look forward to seeing her, and every year we part company.
Knowing that we care for each other, but not quite enough to give up the lives we've made and find comfortable.
She said yes.
You popped the question, and she said yes.
She said yes, and you're stuck good.
No, no.
She said no.
We always say no.
Why do we always say no?
Because you don't really love each other.
Now, how would you know that, Mr. Matthews?
Because if you truly loved each other, you'd risk anything for that love.
Even the lives you've made and find comfortable.
I just wonder if at this stage of my life, my risk-taking days are over.
Or perhaps I never appreciated the value of taking a risk, and that's why I've missed the chance at true love.
Yeah.
I felt that same way when I broke up with Debbie.
You remember that?
No.
Well, I mean, I'm still in there plugging away, because I believe true love can come at any time.
Well, until then, I will continue my life teaching my students.
You got more than your students, Mr. Feeny.
You got your friends.
Eric, if you haven't had your dinner yet, I thought we might grab a bowl of pasta on the north end.
Oh, I don't know, Mr. Feeny.
I mean, it's my first night in Boston.
I was thinking of something a little riskier.
Maybe you and me can go out, hit the town, check out the action.
You mean cruise for chicks?
And their mothers.
You know something, Mr. Feeny, I don't understand this friendship.
Oh, neither do I. Hey!
All right.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very Thank you.
Thank you.
Everyone remember, drive safe.
Okay?
News from the honeymoon suite.
The Moorparks have eaten.
All right.
Don't forget, tomorrow morning, sunrise nature walk.
Wear comfortable shoes.
Good night.
Good night.
Chocolate mint?
Right on your pillow.
Is she your girl?
Sure is.
Mr. Lucky.
I know.
Good night.
Wow.
$42.50.
Now we can afford that public defender.
I cannot do time.
Cory, we're not getting caught, okay?
We have grown as schemers.
You always thought that you would rub off on me, but instead, I have corrupted you.
You're as shady as I am now.
You have to deal with it.
Wrong, Shawn, okay?
The universe will catch up with us.
I trust the universe.
Yeah?
Well The universe better hurry up, because they're all leaving tomorrow.
All we have to do is make it through breakfast, and we didn't get caught.
We have to get caught at breakfast.
They're all leaving after breakfast, so we got to get caught at breakfast.
You hear me?
Wait a minute.
Are we feeding them at breakfast?
There it is!
I think it's only fitting that we bow our heads and give thanks for the food in front of us.
Lower.
We say thanks for this wonderful meal we have in front of us.
Amen.
Okay, we did it.
The upstairs is in a shambles, and every dish Feeny owns is in the sink.
Now we get caught, and I am at peace, because without punishment, my world loses both form and meaning.
You were one of those kids that enjoyed getting spanked, weren't you?
I always deserved it.
You boys made us feel so welcome, we all tidied up after ourselves.
What?
Oh, and Nona did all the dirty dishes.
We are the Timmers.
Don't you know it's us?
Well, forget it, Cory.
The universe cares jack about us.
Shawn, I'm not comfortable with this, you know?
I don't feel right.
I mean, in the old days, we'd be standing here patting ourselves on the back, and your eyes would roll towards the door Like that, because the doorknob would be turning Like that, and the door would open, and Feeny would be standing there.
Ah.
The messrs.
Matthews and Hunter.
The universe still cares about us.
Yeah, I guess it does.
Oh, blast.
I forgot my overnight bag.
It's in the cab.
I'll be right back.
Wait.
We could still pull it off.
All we have to do is get our guests checked out in the next 15 seconds.
No, not gonna.
It is over.
It is our time.
I am at peace.
Arnie, if we don't leave in the next 5 seconds, we're gonna miss our flight, and then we'll have to take a connection over Dallas.
Dallas?
I need Dallas right now.
Splittin' ze taxi?
Okay, well, thanks for staying with us.
I've got your deposits, and I'll be holding your rooms for Christmas.
You go out the front door, Feeny's out the front door.
It's over, over now.
I'm going towards the white light.
Let's go out the back way.
I want to take that bench with me.
Boy, that was close.
Well, well, here she is, Mr. Feeny, your house.
How does she look?
Does she, uh, she look the same?
Here it comes.
Hang in there, buddy.
Well, the credenza is nicely polished.
Plants look well-sunned.
Look, the statue.
The Hecks killed us.
Good!
What?
Arnie took Feeny's statue.
Very nice.
Wait a minute.
My statue.
I confess!
All is right with the world.
Oh, that's just not possible.
Right here, Mr. Feeny.
Just giving it a quick polish.
I must say you boys have done a terrific job.
Just say thank you and walk towards the door.
Thank you and walk towards the door.
How much money did you actually make?
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
All right!
Hey!
I knew you still cared about me.
Okay, so how'd you get us?
Sign at the airport?
Run into a Dutch person?
I gotta know.
Actually, it was the cabdriver.
I gave him my address, he said he knew the place very well, and I should get the room with the jacuzzi.
Oh, the cabdriver.
I forgot to deport the cabdriver.
So I guess you want the money back.
I think that would be appropriate.
How much trouble am I in?
Whoa.
Oh, the usual, Mr. Hunter.
That's it?
Well, you took a risk.
I happen to have a soft spot right now for risk takers.
Take another risk and ask for the money back.
Can I have the money back?
Yes, you can.
When you're in college.
College?
Well, now, you've already proved to yourself that you have a future in business.
That and a college education, you'll do fine.
You hear that?
I'm gonna be okay in this world.
I don't have to be a criminal.
And the universe is a better town for that.
Look, I understand that you're the honeymoon couple, and I appreciate the fact that you've paid for two nights, but I really must insist that you vacate my bedroom immediately.
I mean, check-out time is now.
Oh, listen.
It's not that I can't identify with two young people in love.
I was young once.
I know that when love comes, you must seize it, lest it slip away through the sands of time.
I was young once.
And perhaps I still am.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
So tomorrow's the big day, huh?
Yup.
Tomorrow morning Cory Matthews turns 16 and mobile.
And I have worked out all the details for our big birthday road trip.
You can get your father's car tomorrow night, right?
Well, naturally.
I'm 16, it's my right.
He's probably filling up the tank for me right now.
This is a life landmark.
This is the first Cory drives road trip.
The point is, we are merely guests of the car, the wind, and destiny.
No, no.
The point is, a license says we are adults with cars who can see R-rated movies.
I'm not going with you guys to some R-rated movie.
Uh, Van Damme takes his shirt off.
And that is only the beginning.
The best part is, we are seeing it in Atlantic City.
Why would we go to Atlantic City when we can see it right here?
Because we can.
Because we can go anywhere.
Because tomorrow I got wheels.
I am free and independent.
Tomorrow I am a man!
Who gets a clown burger?
I collect the little hats.
Alan, why aren't you at the store?
Oh, I had Eric open the store.
I got big plans today.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
It's Cory day.
I'm gonna take him down to the DMV, watch him take his driver's test, and off to Woody's Roadhouse for a lethal dose of home fries, steak, and eggs.
Just like you did with Eric.
Mmm-hmm.
My dad did it with me.
A Matthews men's license day tradition.
I washed the car so it'll look good in the picture I'm gonna take after he passes his test.
Does, uh, Cory know about these plans, honey?
Mmm-mmm.
Matthews men tradition.
You don't have to tell 'em.
It's in the genes.
Cory's driving a car.
Without a license?
Hey.
I passed my driver's test.
I got my license.
Well, my temp license anyway.
See?
Honey, that's great.
Alan, isn't that great?
Yeah, that's great, Cor.
Uh, happy birthday.
Yeah, that's really great.
Uh, Mom, is it just me, or were they happier for me down at the DMV?
Oh, actually, Cory, your dad's a little let down.
He kind of thought you might want to do this with him.
He did?
Yeah.
Yeah, but he never said anything.
We didn't have anything planned.
Boy, I went with my dad.
Dad.
Hey, uh, listen, sorry about this whole thing.
Uh, I didn't know it was such a big deal to you.
'Cause, you know, Topanga got her license and Shawn got his, and they wanted to be with me when I got mine.
I didn't want to disappoint 'em.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay.
So, uh, we're cool?
Yeah, we're cool.
Cool enough for you to give me the keys?
Why not?
Got a couple of errands to run.
I wouldn't mind being chauffeured around for a change, huh?
So, road trip.
You got the keys yet?
Oh, uh, you meant with your friends.
Okay.
Well, no, no.
You could come, too.
What?
Kind of road trip would it be without good old Mr. Matthews?
Was what I was gonna say.
And now I'm done.
Hey, I'll tell you what.
I do have a couple of errands to run.
It'll take me a couple hours, but then when I come back, the car's all yours.
All right, buddy?
Yeah.
If you're all right, I'm all right.
Hey, I've waited I can wait a couple hours.
I'm Cory.
I'm 16, and I'm going to Atlantic City to see an R-rated movie.
Uh, here, Morgan, let me help you make the matinee.
Daddy!
Wow.
Look at her go.
Hi.
Hi.
Um Look, I know I told you a couple of hours, but, um, you know, one thing led to another, and You know how it is.
Actually, no.
Having never actually had the car, I don't know how it is.
How is it?
Well, look.
Here are the keys.
The car is yours.
Go do what you want to do.
See, actually, Dad, what I wanted to do was go on a road trip with Shawn and Topanga, who waited here for five hours, and then they realized they had lives and went home.
Fine.
Go pick 'em up.
Take 'em for a drive.
Fine, I will.
Just make sure you're back in time for your birthday dinner.
Well, wait a minute.
You never No, there was nothing ever mentioned about a birthday dinner.
Cory, why would anyone have to mention it?
We've had dinner on your birthday every year since you've been alive.
But I've never been alive with a license, Dad, so this year, road trip.
So we'll see you at Chubbie's in 45 minutes.
Forty-five Dad, that's barely even worth it.
Fine.
Give me the keys.
Fine.
Take 'em.
Aw, what's the matter, birthday brother?
Something got you terribly, terribly sad?
Eric, when you were 16 Yeah, I had the same great hair.
Listen, did Dad still treat you like you were six?
No.
He weirded out a little bit on me because, you know, I got my license and made him feel old, and he went out and bought a cemetery plot and everything, but I bet you it's not nearly as bad as he's treating you.
'Cause he likes you better.
Yup, he does, he does.
Well, that, and he still had you around.
Well, he's got Morgan.
Girl.
What?
You're his last son, son.
Now you're old enough to drive away and leave him alone with Morgan, who goes to Art class.
And Ballet.
Yeah.
See, the only reason you're not cruising down that turnpike right now with your arm around Topanga and Shawn in the back going, "Whoo, whoo, whoo," is because Morgan's his first daughter and not his third son, son.
What?
Down, set, hike.
Buttonhook.
Ow!
Why'd you do that?
Because I called a buttonhook, you woman.
I didn't say stop and go.
I didn't say down and out.
I didn't say post.
I said buttonhook.
Now was the ball not there waiting for you?
If you don't stop yelling, I'm going upstairs to play with Barbie and Skipper.
No, no.
Don't do that.
Here, put these on.
I don't want to wear boxing mittens.
I don't know how they work.
Morgan, they're not boxing mittens, okay?
They're boxing gloves, and they don't work.
You just hit me.
Ah!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Fine.
I'm glad you're happy.
I have to change into my party dress for your party.
No dress.
Wear pants.
Keep the helmet on, and call a doctor.
I don't want you to think that I'm not having a dandy time here at Chubbie's, where we always went 'cause we could walk here, but could we just do the cake thing and then hit the open road?
Will you stop telling Cory to ditch his own birthday party?
And you, put a smile on your face and behave yourself.
Guys, we rented the room.
You don't have to whisper.
Sorry, Dad.
Um, listen, thank you, thank you guys for the party.
It's really nice, but, uh, there's this movie we're trying to make.
What movie?
101 Dalmatians.
Would you finally grow up?
We're going to see the new Van Damme movie.
Aha, well, wouldn't that be an R-rated movie?
Dad, come on, I'm 16.
I'm not a little kid anymore.
Here's your clown burger.
I told them it was your birthday, so they threw in an extra hat.
Whoo-hoo!
I mean, whoo-hoo.
Cory, I understand you're 16, and yet you have to be 17 to get in without an adult.
Fine, no movie.
Thank you.
No biggie, no biggie.
There's got to be tons of other stuff we can do in Atlantic City.
Let's hit those tables, huh?
You really don't want to do anything at all, do you?
You want to sneak into an R-rated film in another state?
I'm not just gonna give you my blessing.
Alan, it's his birthday.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
Dad, I wasn't asking you for your blessing here.
I just wanted to go somewhere with my friends.
Cory, this is your father.
You think because you got a license, you can do whatever you want.
No.
I just want to go somewhere with my friends.
I don't care where I go.
I just want to go.
I'll tell you what.
You want to take a road trip?
You want to go off with your friends?
That's the first adult decision you're gonna make?
Yeah.
Fine.
There you go, pal.
Come on, let's go.
Yes.
I don't know.
I mean, part of me knows I shouldn't get in that car with them, but then there's the other side of me, which isn't sensible or mature at all, wants to get in that car with them and go, "a-oo-ga.
" Thank you for your attention at this very difficult time.
You are gonna go after them, aren't you?
No, Amy, I'm not.
* Happy, happy, happy birthday * Happy, happy, happy birthda-hay * It's his day, his day of birth * Yeah, that's right, his first day on earth * Happy bir-ir-ir-irthday, yeah * I missed something, didn't I?
So, here we are, on our own, driving down the open road.
Just me, my Topanga, and my Shawn, and a big full moon right behind us.
Cory, those are headlights.
Come around me.
Come around me, please.
Cory, can you drive a little faster?
'Cause there's like 20 cars jammed up behind us.
Shawn, I happen to be cruising at What's it say?
I can't look down or we'll crash.
I'm up to 18.
I hope this thing has air bags.
Cory, a bicycle just passed you.
Come around me.
Come around me, please.
No.
See, it's already It's already Nah.
Fine, fine.
I'll go faster.
How much farther to Atlantic City?
What's the difference?
We're all gonna die here.
Speaking of that, I think we should call your folks and let them know we're okay.
Forget it.
I'm not calling my dad, okay?
Kids have to call.
That's just what my dad expects his little kid to do.
Cory, I don't get it.
You and your father have always gotten along great.
Yeah, 'cause I've always been safe and dependable Cory.
Well, tonight a new Cory is born.
Dark, wild Cory, built for speed.
Twenty-four, 25, 26.
Look at me.
I'm breaking the law.
Well, we all saw that coming.
Uh, listen, with all due respect, Officer Dibble, um, I was on a country road going 26 miles an hour.
In a 25-mile zone, son.
Forget it, Cory.
It's a stinking speed trap.
Call your dad.
No way I'm calling my dad.
Then I guess you'll see the judge.
The judge?
One mile over, you call in the judge?
Don't you people have anything better to do in this town?
It's not a town.
It's a speed trap.
Now you can avoid a trial altogether by just paying the fine.
Fine, I'll pay the fine.
How much?
$200.
For one mile over the speed limit?
It's a speed trap.
Is this not getting through to you?
Call your dad.
No way I am calling my dad.
Is this not getting through to you?
All rise!
The court of Judge Hubert Lamb is now in session.
Judge Lamb?
I think I'll take my chances with Judge Lamb.
Bring him up here.
Cor!
Cory.
Hey, Cory.
What?
Hey, Cory.
Hey, what day is today?
What day is today?
Huh?
What day is today?
My birthday.
That's right.
Can you take a picture of them?
Sure, pal.
This is Iron Sheik, and he's the bad guy.
Uh-huh.
This is Iron Sheik.
He's a good guy.
This is Hulk Hogan.
He's a good guy.
And this is Big John Stud, and he's a good guy.
Yeah?
Take it?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, Cory!
Whoops!
Hey, come here!
Over here!
Come here, come here!
You won the game, Son!
Good job!
I'm sure he's okay.
Oh, I know.
He's just trying to prove something to us, to me.
You know, I just feel bad.
Well, hey, you guys had plans.
He broke 'em.
Yeah, but we didn't really have plans.
I just assumed that he'd run in and wake me up and drag me down to the DMV, you know, like he always used to do, you know, like he used to always run in the room and wake me up and drag me places.
When he was Younger.
Yeah.
He was five-years-old.
He dragged you out of bed to show you his lost tooth.
Well, I miss that.
Alan, he's growing up.
He's not doing anything wrong.
Well, I'm growing up, too.
And you're not doing anything wrong either.
Hey, Mom, you gonna help me do my hair, or what?
Hey, Morgan, how about I help you do your hair?
Are you kidding me?
Yes, I am kidding you.
Okay, uh, I've got one thing to tell you that's gonna make you feel real good, and then I've got another thing to tell you that's gonna scare the hell out of you.
Which would you like first?
Feel good.
Ultimately, the reason that I never had a son is because of the sheer weight of responsibility for another human life is so enormous, so daunting, that I genuinely didn't know if I was up to it.
Oh, come on.
You're a teacher.
Your whole life's about kids.
No, no, no.
My job is about kids.
My life is my own, unlike yours, which hasn't been your own since the day Eric was born.
What are you saying?
I'm a hostage?
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
You are a hostage to extreme emotional joys and disappointments, which your children will bring you for as long as you live.
One day you're putting on training wheels.
The next day you're teaching them how to drive.
Of course, the first thing they want to do is drive away from you.
Mmm-hmm.
You're right.
It scares the hell out of me.
So, now tell me the part that makes me feel good.
Mmm What?
That was the good part.
Where?
You know, the emotional joys, you had children and I didn't, and how lucky you are, and emotional joys, and, uh, joys.
How bad is it, George?
Well, I just had a phone call from Cory.
Is he all right?
No, he's fine.
It's nothing like that.
Good, good.
He's on trial.
I clocked the vehicle, Your Honor, traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.
One mile over.
The law is the law, boy, and we obey the law in my courtroom, and if you speak out of turn again, I'll hang you.
You would hang me on my birthday?
It's your birthday under oath?
Under oath, Your Honor.
You want a dog or a hat?
What?
Hey, how about a sword?
Here, have a sword.
Wow, cool.
Look what I got.
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.
Sidebar, Your Honor?
Cory, the first thing I learned on the street is that any judge who spontaneously makes you balloon toys will, at the end of the day, actually hang you.
It's my sword, and I'm not sharing it.
So, what brings a freshly licensed all the way out here?
Well, I wanted to drive.
They said I could drive, so I just drove, but my dad refuses to accept that I'm not his little kid anymore.
You know, he wants to keep me at home, watch games, play football, so I just got my friends, I got the keys, and drove.
I feel I did right.
Your Honor, sir, hi, Topanga Lawrence.
Um, I just wanted to say that I can pay Cory's fine if you'll just tell me where the nearest ATM is located.
There's no ATM.
You're in the middle of nowhere.
Oh.
Okay, well, in that case, all I can say is that, um, Cory is a very nice boy who never hurt anybody, and if you do anything to him on his first day of driving, then I just think you are a mean, mean Dog or hat?
Could it be a princess hat?
You got it.
There you go.
Thanks.
Um, tell you what I'm gonna do, son.
Gonna drop all the charges right now if you'll take this quarter and go to that phone there and call your dad and tell him you were wrong.
No.
Cory.
I'm sorry.
I don't believe I'm wrong.
Well, I don't believe I'm wrong either, Cory.
You didn't have to come here, Dad.
George Feeny told me you called.
You should have called me.
Why?
So you could come to the rescue again?
Prove once again what a little helpless kid I am?
Cory, you are my son.
You'll always be my son, whether you're six or you're 60, and your problem is my problem.
Now, I'm always gonna be there for you.
Now, that is never gonna change.
I just want you to treat me as someone who can handle his own problems, Dad.
I want you to treat me like an adult.
All right, I've heard enough.
This court is ready to pronounce sentence.
Cory Matthews and Cory Matthews' father, approach the bench.
I hereby sentence you to, uh, two years.
What?
Today is your That means you have two years more of being a kid.
Now I know that seems like hard labor when you have a license in your hand, but from what I can surmise of your home life, you're luckier, Cory, than most who appear before me.
And you, dad, I sentence you to take those two years and cherish them, because they go by too fast.
Yes, they do, don't they?
Mmm.
It's a speed trap.
You set?
Go.
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa!
Go forward.
Forward.
Push it forward.
That's it.
Okay.
Go on.
Hey, there you go.
Oh, you should get your license.
Happy birthday, Son.
Thanks, Dad.
So, uh, when do you think there's gonna be tension between us again?
Well, we just got through the driver's license thing, so probably the next time we fight, it'll be over your choice of college.
Dad, I'm not going to college.
Well, then it'll be over the job you want to get.
Circus clown.
Well, I guess we'll have to fight over the woman you're gonna marry.
Dad, Topanga and I have already run off to Vegas.
Amy!
No more kids!
Well, I guess I'm stuck.
I guess you are.
What are you gonna do about it, punk?
You wanna You wanna make something of it?
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
My column, my column, my column My column.
"Is it just me"?
By "Cory Matthews.
" Do I have to?
Enjoy.
"Is it just me, or does paste just not taste as good as it used to?
"Is it just me, or is Homer Simpson getting a little too old to be on the show"?
Isn't that so true?
Cory, I know you really believe in your little humor column, but, uh Don't you think you should be writing about something a little more important, like the girls' swim team and why they don't wear high heels?
So, Debbie, Gary took you to Le Chardonnay?
It's really expensive.
Yeah, I know.
It was great.
We were talking and laughing and having such a great time and then At the end of the night Parked two blocks from my house Octopus time.
Hey!
Had a nice night the other night.
All over me.
What happened to the nice guy I had dinner with?
It's like, the night's almost over, so he's all over me?
Why are guys such jerks on dates?
Not all guys, Debbie.
"Not all guys, Debbie.
" Is it just me, or should you not be proud of that?
Oh.
After a night of fighting them off, it's like I don't know whether I want to go out on dates anymore, you know?
Rather spend my time at the library.
It's that pathetic.
It's too bad guys and girls have such a different idea about what a date is supposed to be.
Yeah.
What goes on in their heads?
Want to find out?
There's two of them.
Hey, what goes on in your heads?
Topanga.
24 hours a day, it's the Topanga channel in here.
Aw, who's a good boy?
Debbie, don't you think that guys and girls are looking for the same things on dates?
Well, girls are looking for an evening of good conversation and, you know, the sense that you've made a genuine connection with another human being.
You're not interested in making out?
Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not, but it shouldn't be expected because I went on a date with you.
So, how are we supposed to know what's okay?
We'll let you know.
You don't let us know very clearly.
Yes, we do.
You just don't listen.
You're too busy planning your next move to hear us say no.
What?
You see, this is why I write my funny column.
To take us away from the drudgery of interesting conversation.
Yeah, but you should be writing about something that affects people.
Yeah.
Why don't you write your column about why guys are such big jerks on dates?
Debbie, if you really feel that all guys want to do is go too far, then why go out with them at all?
You're right.
I'm done.
Way to be sensitive, Shawn.
Yeah.
Yeah, it really pays to be honest with a girl.
Is it just me?
Or is it just me?
To research his book, Black Like Me, author John Griffin, a white man, had his skin pigment temporarily darkened, so that he could experience life through the perspective of a black man.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just ask?
Well, there was such distrust between the races that Griffin felt that only by becoming black could he begin to understand the horrors of segregation.
Cory, that's your next story.
What?
To understand what girls are talking about, you experience the world from a girl's point of view by becoming a girl.
That's crazy talk.
No, no, no.
You dress up like a girl and write about it.
Chick Like Me.
That's meaningful.
You're writing a real article, not just some silly column.
It is not a silly column.
Yes, it is.
Ok, Mr. Feeny.
What happened to this guy Griffin after he wrote his book?
He sold five million copies and won immediate world renown.
Why do you ask, Mr. Matthews?
Miss Matthews.
What?
Nothing.
This is the dome 2000.
When you get to the top of the mountain and that wind starts to blowin', you'll be real glad you got this over your head.
I'll remember who sold it to me, too.
I hope you do.
That way, you can remember me for all your future wilderness needs.
Listen, um I imagine you probably get this a lot, but you seem awfully nice.
You want to go get a cup of coffee sometime?
You seem mighty nice, too, but I'm not much of a coffee drinker.
Oh, that's okay.
We could do something else.
Anything.
That would be great.
Why don't you come over to my place, and I'll cook you a big ol' dinner.
How about tonight?
Really?
That would be Wow.
Oh, great.
And after dinner, that's when the real fun starts.
I'm always up for a little fun.
Good, because we rub oil all over our bodies I like that.
Go jumpin' in the cold river What?
And go eel grabbin'.
What?
It's fun, great fun.
And for the eels, too, unless their heads break off.
So, uh, what time tonight?
Uh, tonight Tonight's really not good for me.
I've got another appointment which doesn't actually involve eels.
Oh, come on, Dave.
Where's your sense of adventure?
You know, I'll just take the tent.
Oh!
In fact, you keep the tent, and what I'm gonna do is leave.
Wait.
Well, I was just trying to be friendly.
Eric, is there something the matter with me?
Eric, is there something the matter with me?
I'm lookin'.
No.
I mean, why am I always scaring boys off?
Well, Lonnie, you don't have a lot of social experience with men, do you?
No, not city men.
Didn't you date any guys back there in the mountains?
Oh, sure.
We'd go out in the woods and shoot things.
Oh, so you like hunting?
All right.
Well, here's a question for you.
When you see a cute little fuzzy animal that you like, that you know you like to shoot, do you go running up to it, yelling and waving your rifle in the air?
Well, no.
And why not?
'Cause it will scare the little critter off.
Oh.
Oh, so you're saying my behavior is scaring these city men.
Just a smidge.
I have to learn how to hunt and track these boys.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, I'm gonna need a city man to practice on.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Son.
How was your day?
Fine.
What'd you do in school?
Nothing.
Hey, hold on.
Wait there.
You know, every day, I ask you what did you do, and every day, you tell me nothing.
Well, I'm tired of nothing.
I mean, we both know something happened today, and I want to know what it is.
I decided to be a girl.
Well, you taught me a very valuable lesson there, Son.
You know the book Black Like Me?
Sure.
Is that what you guys are reading in school?
Don't ask questions, honey.
Cory's gonna write Chick Like Me for the school newspaper.
He's gonna experience life from a girl's point of view by dressing up like a girl.
No, don't want you to.
Oh, come on.
I think it would be a wonderful learning experience.
It could serve him well for the rest of his life.
What's in here, Cor It's a miracle bra.
It's a miracle bra, honey.
Get a camera.
Oh, I'm not dressing up like a girl just for the sake of dressing up like a girl.
I'm a journalist, dagnabbit.
Hi, Topanga.
Hi.
Shawn, I might've been a bit protective of Debbie this morning, and I didn't fully consider your point of view.
I never knew I had a point of view.
You know what, Topanga, everything's worked out for the best because I've decided to be a girl and to see what it's really like.
Not in that dress, you're not.
Well, that's why I was counting on your expert assistance to help in selecting the proper female accouterments.
You want me to dress you up like a girl?
Yeah, Topanga.
Make Cory pretty.
Cool.
Cory?
Sweetie, you have to come out eventually.
Don't want to.
Second thoughts.
Come on out.
We won't laugh.
You're not seeing what I'm seeing.
Hey, Cor, come on, buddy.
You're gonna write an article that means something.
You're gonna make a difference, not only in our lives, but in the lives of guys and girls everywhere.
You're not seeing what I'm seeing.
Come on, Cor.
How bad a girl could you be?
Okay, bad.
How bad?
Bad-bad.
I knew it.
I look I look fat.
Fat is the least of your problems, baby.
Topanga Maybe it's just not a good color for you.
Come on, you guys.
We can do this.
It's just all how you present yourself.
Now, Cory, let's see how you present yourself.
Okay.
Was that all right?
Not even on a desert island.
Instructive, Shawn.
Okay, look.
Cor, you're missing the obvious.
Girls just glide more.
They're more at ease.
You gotta kind of let it flow.
That's pretty right on the nose there, Shawn.
Yeah, well.
Girls are my area.
I like girls.
Ok, then show me, Shawn.
Show me.
What's to show?
Here.
What?
Oh, no.
No.
No, no, no.
Why is everybody staring?
What are they looking at?
Well, Shawn, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but you're kind of a babe.
Really?
Yeah.
You want me to, like, carry your books for you?
I get that?
Yeah, thanks.
Why are you carrying his books?
We're trying to create the illusion that Shawn's a girl, so I thought this would help.
You never carry my books.
Well, look at him.
And look at you.
You are just radiant today.
Shawn, how does it feel to be wearing panty hose?
Not Shawn.
You're right.
Yeah, he needs a girl's name.
Ok, this is easy.
How about Janet?
No, no, no, not Janet.
What possible difference could it make?
Cory!
You've thought about this before, haven't you?
A little.
And what name have you thought about?
Well Veronica.
Veronica is a lovely name.
Good morning, Miss Lawrence.
Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Hunter.
If there's anything you need to talk about, my door is always open.
I'm not here to judge.
It's for an article we're writing, Mr. Feeny.
I am not here to judge.
Okay, guys, target's approaching.
Guys.
Hi, Gary.
Debbie said you two went out on Saturday.
Yeah.
I had a nice time.
Hi there.
Um I'm Gary.
Gary, this is Veronica.
Veronica Wasboyski.
Hi.
You know, I have never seen you before.
You new in school?
Yep.
I'm just a whole new person.
Listen, uh If you want, I'd be happy to, uh, you know, take you to Chubbie's, tell you what teachers to avoid, that kind of stuff.
Unless your boyfriend already did that.
Oh, no, Gary.
This one is definitely available.
Cory, I can speak for myself.
Well, then you just do that, Veronica.
That'd be great.
So, Saturday, is that good for both of you?
Saturday's my date night.
It still is.
Okay, Saturday.
I'll give up a Saturday.
Well, I'll see you then.
Shawny, way to go.
You got the date.
What?
I have nothing to wear.
All right, Lonnie.
Now Let's say we're at a club.
Let's say that I'm Dave, and I'm standing here at the bar, and you see me from across the room, and you say to yourself I want that one.
No, no, no, no.
Remember hunting?
Remember the boy bunnies?
You don't want to scare 'em away.
There'll be nothing left to hunt.
Yeah, that's no fun.
No, it's not.
Here's what you gotta do.
You gotta approach me without being detected.
You stand next to me, but not close enough to make me realize that I'm your prey.
Now turn to me.
Make eye contact.
Smile.
And then say I want that one!
I admire your single-mindedness, but no.
What guys really like is a compliment.
You give us a great compliment, we're yours for the rest of your life.
That is the nicest shirt.
I'd love to get one just like that for my brother Buck.
Who makes that?
Some shirt guy.
Can I look?
Oh, I can't seem to find the label.
Is it someplace else?
Could be anywhere.
I wouldn't stop looking.
Oh, you know what I'm doin'?
Just what God intended?
No.
I'm bein' too friendly again, and you were just about to tell me that, weren't you?
Yeah, I was gonna get to that eventually.
You know, I never would've thought that bein' friendly could drive people away.
But I guess friendliness is just different between men and women.
Yeah, I guess it is.
So, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna step back a respectable distance here, and I'm just gonna say hello.
Hello.
My name is Lonnie Boden, and I will do whatever I can not to physically invade your personal space.
Perhaps we can discuss our career goals over a Grape Nehi.
What have I done?
This has been a terrific evening, and you are just great.
And so I'm wonderin', how is it that someone like you doesn't have a boyfriend?
I haven't really been looking for a boyfriend, 'cause I just been going through a lot of changes.
Listen, any time you want to talk, I'm here to listen.
Thanks.
That's That's nice, Gary.
I gotta have some food.
Oh, you got it.
Waitress!
How ya doin', honey?
Cory?
I'm Cora.
I'll be your waitress this evening.
You know, I come in here a lot, and I've never seen you before.
Quit hitting on me.
I'm just kidding.
It's my first night.
Besides, it looks like you're already taken, cutie.
You're insane.
May I take your order, baby?
My usual.
A double chiliburger and one chocolate milk shake and two straws.
I'll have the same and a steak.
What?
Well, aren't you the voracious little eater.
So, you having a good time?
A little trouble breathing.
You're crowding me a bit.
Oh, maybe you're just tense.
How about I rub your shoulders?
You know, I didn't ask you to do that.
Yeah, but doesn't it feel good?
You're not listening to me.
Whoa, you're a strong one.
Yeah, I play a little field hockey.
Yeah, I knew that, because the first thing I noticed were your legs.
Aah!
What's the matter?
You just don't listen.
You're too busy planning your next move to hear us say no.
What?
Hey, where you going?
He touched me.
Where?
On my knee.
It's my knee.
What makes him think that it's his knee?
Maybe you sent him a signal.
The only signal I sent him was "stop it.
" And he didn't listen.
I'm not like that.
I'm not.
I never will be again.
Okay, well, here he comes.
No, no.
I quit.
You can't.
We have an article to finish.
I should've worn a pantsuit.
Look, uh, sorry I got a little aggressive.
Nobody respects women more than me.
You forgive me?
Of course she forgives you.
You two are just adorable together.
Isn't he just delish?
Tell you what.
How about I teach you how to play foosball?
How about I teach you?
Yeah, right.
My hosiery is bunching.
Now, uh, what you need to do is you want to spin that handle, and you want to make this little guy kick the ball.
Like this?
Yeah.
Kind of like that.
I can go a little easier if you want.
Just take your next shot.
Oh, nice block.
Oh, you liked that?
Let me show you how I did it.
Now, what you need to have is a real light touch.
Hey, hey.
Hey, what?
What is wrong with you?
I'm just showing you how to play the game.
I know how to play the game.
Yeah, I could tell by the way you're dressed.
I just wanted to look nice.
Well, you do.
I said don't touch me.
Okay, don't like to be touched.
Did it ever occur to you that I might be a nice girl?
No.
What I thought was that you'd be into guys.
Yeah, but, I guess you're not.
I guess you prefer girls.
As a matter of fact, I do.
What?
I said, as a matter of fact I do!
What was that for?
For every girl I've ever known.
Uh, please pay at the register, honey.
And tipping is not a city in China.
Come on, honey, we're out of here.
Gentlemen, it seems the whole school is talking about it.
And if I do say so myself, excellent article.
Troubling photographs.
Cory, I am so proud of you.
The article is wonderful.
Well, I am a journalist, dagnabbit.
Shawn, I wanted to thank you for what you did.
Hey, not necessary.
I learned a lot.
You did?
Yeah.
In fact, of all the guys around, I'd say I'm the world's most perfect date right now.
I'd say of all the girls around, I could probably use a perfect date right now.
So, what did you have in mind?
I don't know.
We could, uh, start with an evening of good conversation.
And a genuine connection with another human being?
Hey, I'm your boy.
What's wrong?
My hosiery is still bunching.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Eric, listen, don't think I don't appreciate a good T-bone, but I would've been plenty happy with a double Chubbie burger.
He gets steak.
I get cold grilled cheese.
What gives?
Well, Morgan, I just feel that our brother, with his interesting life, he deserves a hearty meal.
You don't think my life's interesting?
Morgan, did I just do something nice for Cory?
Yeah.
Do I normally do nice stuff for Cory?
No.
Why would I do nice stuff for Cory?
Because something terrible happened to him.
Eat your grilled cheese.
So I would be correct in assuming that this wonderful meal is actually one of those condemned-man, death-row, last-meal kind of things.
But that can't be, because there's no cake.
Dead man walking.
Should we do this in the living room?
We could do it there.
I'm only telling you this because I'm your older brother and it's the right thing to do.
Big build-up.
Bad, bad, bad.
Don't tell me.
No, Cory, I think you gotta hear this one.
All right, then tell me.
As long as it doesn't have anything to do with Shawn or Topanga, I should be okay.
Okay, have you ever heard the expression Well, you certainly have my attention.
Cor, I saw Shawn at Chubbie's.
He was there with Topanga.
She seemed upset.
They were hugging and he kissed her.
What?
He kissed her.
What?
Nothing happened at all.
You know, normally I love telling you bad stuff, but this one's killing me.
Pick up the phone, Shawn.
Are you there?
Pick up the phone.
Cor, I know how upset you must be.
Eric, listen, nothing happened at all, right?
You said so yourself.
Topanga, it's me.
Are you there?
It's 7:00.
Pick up the phone.
Where are you?
I had to tell you, right?
You understand I had to tell you what I saw.
Eric, listen, I understand that you're my older brother, okay?
You're not supposed to let anything bad happen to me.
How could you let this happen to me?
Okay, I understand that you're upset and that's why I'm not gonna kick your butt.
You saw him kiss her?
I did.
Then my butt's kicked anyway.
Shawn.
Hi.
Topanga.
Hi.
The both of you.
Hi.
Topanga, I need to talk to you.
I can't.
I have Feeny's history class.
No, you don't.
You have lunch now.
How come you didn't call me back last night?
It was really late.
It was 7:00.
Cory, I have history now.
What?
Wait.
Where are you going?
I have history now.
You have lunch now, with me.
You let her go.
Okay.
Okay, but I only got like a minute or two.
All right, listen, I am gonna be absolutely mature about this.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
You and Topanga, together at Chubbie's last night.
Eric saw you.
You-and-Topanga-together- at-Chubbie's-last-night- Eric-saw-you who?
Were you at Chubbie's last night?
Eric has no idea what he saw.
Were you at Chubbie's last night?
Yes.
Were you there with Topanga?
Yes.
Okay, I'll be looking for a no on this next question.
Got it?
Yes.
No.
Did you kiss her?
Yes.
No!
You kissed her?
Cory, it was no big deal, okay?
Topanga got into a fight with her parents.
She was real emotional and I happened to be there, so I gave her a hug, and yes, I gave her an innocent kiss.
Innocent.
That's what happened.
And you know that I tell you everything.
Yeah, but how come she didn't come to me?
She will.
We just happened to run into each other first, that's all.
Okay, well, I guess I feel better then.
Topanga loves you.
You brother's got you jumping to conclusions.
Tell him to back off.
Excuse me.
And Shawn's my best friend and Topanga loves me, okay?
And it takes a pretty twisted sibling to think that they would ever entertain the thought of sneaking around behind my back.
You know, Shawn was right about you.
Seeing what you don't see, jumping to conclusions.
You are my brother, Eric.
You're supposed to protect me.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Hey, Eric.
Eric?
Leave me alone.
You don't know what's going on.
Yeah?
You think you can do something that causes Cory pain, you're not gonna get pain back?
You don't know what's goin' on.
Eric!
Eric, listen, let him go, okay?
I've thought this out.
I've reached my own conclusion.
And my own conclusion is that something bad happened.
Something bad happened, didn't it?
Yeah, it did.
Then tell me.
I can't, okay?
You just gotta talk to Topanga.
What are you doing?
What was that for?
I wanted to be the last one to kiss you before I kill you.
Cory Topanga, my favorite part about our relationship is that we've always been able to talk to each other about anything.
So I want you to talk to me.
What was that for?
I wanted to be the last one to kiss you before I kill you.
This is really bad, huh?
Cory, look.
You're my best friend and you always have been.
And more.
And I know how young and stupid this is, but I've always believed that we'd be together for the rest of our lives.
Stop time.
What?
I want to call stop time now.
I want to stop time because I know that if you keep on going, then you're gonna get to the bad part.
But I know that if we stop time, then we're gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Hey, I called a stop time.
You can't cry.
Nothing happens during stop time.
We're just together.
Please, don't cry.
How come there's so many boxes in your room?
Cory My family and I are moving.
To a different house on the same block you live on now?
We're leaving Philadelphia.
We're moving the day after tomorrow.
There's no way out of this.
My mom was transferred to Pittsburgh and they need her right away.
Cory, you have to say something.
I don't believe in Pittsburgh.
I believe in us.
I mean, I don't care if I have to walk to Pittsburgh.
Nothing's gonna come between us, all right?
We're gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Okay.
So there.
I'm as young and stupid as you.
I'm sorry I was afraid to talk to you.
And here you are, trying to make me feel better.
Cory, what's going to happen?
Nothing.
Look, what's gonna happen is that this is a simple test for our relationship.
A simple piece-of-cake test for a relationship as solid as ours.
You're right.
If two people who care about each other as much as we do can't hold it together, then there's no hope for anyone.
No.
It's gonna take something a lot bigger than Pittsburgh to break us apart.
What was that for?
I wanted to be the last one to kiss you before I kiss you again.
Cory, honey, I know how hard this must seem right now, but sometimes we have to believe that things happen for a reason and that life works out for the best.
Mom, listen, everything's gonna work out.
I mean, do you know how close Philadelphia and Pittsburgh actually are?
It's very easy.
It's just a matter of rearranging some schedules.
No, I think it's going to be harder than you realize.
Amy, Cory's trying very hard.
Now, why do we have to Because, Alan, it's going to be harder than he realizes and I think he needs to know that.
Mom, listen, Topanga and I have talked about this, okay?
If we believe we can make this work, why would you doubt us?
I don't doubt your feelings for Topanga.
It's just that long-distance relationships are very difficult.
Okay, so what are you saying?
You want us to just give up?
No, Cory, I'm saying that you have lived around the corner from each other all your lives and now you won't and that's going to make things painful.
Why is Mom talking about pain?
Because it may be tougher than you think.
Listen, guys, Topanga and I know what's in each other's hearts, okay?
And if our hearts say that we're worth any sacrifice for each other and we're willing to make those sacrifices because we're gonna be together for the rest of our lives, then why shouldn't we?
The rest of your lives.
Yeah, that's right.
Cory, you're 16 years old.
Yeah, Mom, so are a couple of friends of mine named Romeo and Juliet and they turned out okay, didn't they?
Won't work?
Look at my man Romeo, in love with his Juliet.
Nothing's keeping them apart.
Mr. Matthews.
Brushing up on your Shakespeare?
Well, yeah, you know how you always told us that we should take what we learn in the classroom and apply it to everyday life?
You and Topanga?
She's moving to Padua.
Pittsburgh.
She told me.
I'm sorry, Mr. Matthews.
Well, listen, there are those who don't think we can make it because we're just a couple of kids, but, you know, here's the proof, Mr. Feeny, that two kids with everything going against them can take the power of love and make it work.
Whoa, boy.
What?
You haven't actually finished the play, have you?
Well, they're in love.
What could possibly go wrong?
Flip ahead a little.
"Yea noise!
Then I'll be brief "O happy dagger "This is thy sheath "There rust "And let me die" "Happy dagger," see?
Happy.
"She picks up Romeo's dagger, "stabs herself and dies.
" Shakespeare.
What a hack.
You know, Cory, over the course of a person's life, he comes across a few defining moments.
Now, this is one of yours.
It's an opportunity, really.
Mr. Feeny, I don't know.
I mean Look, Pittsburgh's 305 miles away.
Maybe I'm just kidding myself.
Oh, well, now For as long as I've known you, whenever you've been faced with adversity, you have always risen to the occasion.
Now, I have no reason to believe that you won't again.
Do you believe that two Friar Feeny?
I believe that you and Miss Lawrence have something that you won't allow yourselves to lose.
And if you search your heart and listen to its instruction, you won't go wrong.
Thanks.
That was brilliant.
My true journey to Topanga begins, huh?
Yes, well There we are.
Marry me.
We'll buy a house, start a family and live in the same city.
Cory, we can't get married.
Look, I know we'll struggle at first, but all couples struggle at first.
But I figure we get a couple of part-time jobs, cut back on expenses and find an abandoned home in an upscale neighborhood.
No bugs.
That's all I ask.
No bugs.
Cory.
All right, one bug, but nothing with teeth.
Now let's go see how much your parents will kick in.
Okay?
Come on, let's go.
Cory, we can't get married.
Can we see each other every weekend?
Yeah.
Can we write letters to each other every day?
Yeah.
Every day.
Look, Topanga, I don't know.
I mean, it is a new town.
It's a new school.
It's new people.
I mean, pretty soon guys are gonna be lining up to ask you out.
I mean, with me not there, why shouldn't you accept?
What about you, Cory?
I know a million girls who would love to go out with you.
Really?
'Cause I was thinking about 10.
Cory.
It's a little tension breaker.
So where does that leave us?
I'm leaving for Pittsburgh tomorrow night.
Yeah.
Well, it's a long walk to Pittsburgh.
So does that mean I have to give you back your jean jacket?
No.
Keep it.
It's yours.
Like I am.
Good.
'Cause I wouldn't have given it back to you anyway.
So What are you and Topanga doing this weekend?
You know, Shawn, it occurs to me that we have been here an hour and you have yet to feel bad for me.
Now why is that?
Why haven't you felt bad for me?
Cory, would you say that I happen to watch a lot of TV?
More than anyone I know.
Why?
I have seen this plot a thousand times and it always ends exactly the same.
The girlfriend never moves away.
Shawn, this girlfriend's mom got a job in Pittsburgh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, all packed up, enrolled in a new school, boo-hoo, tears, tears.
Give me a challenge, okay?
Topanga is not going anywhere.
Shawn, it's not TV.
Trust me.
So, you're saying that she can't move if we're really supposed to be together, can she?
Not if TV is the true mirror of our lives.
Okay, okay.
But wait, wait.
What about tomorrow night?
Now, tomorrow night she's coming over to my house to say goodbye.
What about that?
It's not gonna happen.
What about ER?
Now, the doctor on ER, she really left.
What about her?
ER's real.
Ah!
So You don't really think she's gonna leave, do you?
No, I don't.
And why not?
Because you don't deserve that kind of pain.
Hi, Cory.
Hi, Shawn.
Thanks for coming.
Sure, Topanga.
Really sorry you're moving.
Listen, Topanga, I was thinking, Saturday night, maybe you and I, we could go out to dinner, we could see a movie, we could hold each other for five hours.
Cory, what are you saying?
I came over to say goodbye.
That's hard enough.
Topanga, listen, we don't need to say goodbye because you're not going anywhere.
You're not moving.
Cory, what are you saying?
My parents are in the car waiting for me.
We're leaving for Pittsburgh.
No, you're not moving because we're supposed to be together like we've always talked about, so, you can't move.
Because we don't deserve that kind of pain.
Cory, will you just give me a hug and a kiss and say goodbye to me?
No.
Goodbye, Cory.
I love you.
Shawn, what's happening?
It's not over yet.
That car's gonna turn around.
Just wait.
Just watch.
Any second now.
Uh-huh.
Just wait.
Okay.
What the hell kind of TV show is this?
Shawn, you know that pain everyone keeps talking about?
Yeah?
I think I'm starting to feel it.
What's going on?
Not much.
Smells good out here.
What is that, trees?
I didn't even say goodbye, Eric.
That's all right.
You'll say goodbye the next time you say hello.
Pittsburgh's not that far.
I made the drive last night.
You really went?
Oh, yeah.
Drove there, met a couple of girls, told them I drove all the way from Philly, they called me a moron and here I am.
Look, I was gonna go out, I don't know, get a pizza, rent some movies.
You want to go?
No, thanks.
Aw, come on.
It'll be my treat.
We'll go to Little Tony's.
No, I just think I want to stay here.
Listen, Cor, I know I'm your older brother and everything, but, uh I don't know how to protect you from this one.
Could you just stay here with me?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm not going anywhere, man.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Previously on Boy Meets World.
Something bad happened, didn't it?
Yeah, it did.
Then tell me.
I can't, okay?
You just gotta talk to Topanga.
My family and I are moving.
To a different house on the same block you live on now?
We're leaving Philadelphia.
So you're saying that she can't move if we're really supposed to be together, can she?
Not if TV is the true mirror of our lives.
Now, the doctor on ER, she really left.
ER's real.
Cory, will you just give me a hug and a kiss and say goodbye to me?
No.
Now, now, don't be such a rushy boy.
A rushy boy?
Since Rosie and I came to America, we really haven't been on very many dates, you know.
Isn't that so, Rosie?
Yes, and I suppose as such, Becky and I have a little catching up to do.
Oh, you're wicked.
Did you hear that, Cor?
They have a little catching up to do.
Well, I suppose anyone can sit on a couch, but you were clever enough to choose the cozy chair.
Hmm?
Clever indeed.
Are you just as clever?
Hello, Topanga, hi!
How are you?
I miss you.
I miss you so much.
I didn't hear the phone ring.
Did you hear the phone ring, Becky?
No, I didn't hear the phone ring.
No, not at all.
Well, you miss me, too?
Yes, I think about you every day.
You hung up the phone on Topanga!
I hung up on nobody, Cor.
The phone has to ring for somebody to be on it.
Not when you're in love.
Or nuts!
You're killing me, man.
I haven't done anything.
That is exactly what the problem is.
You have a beautiful girl from another country who doesn't understand our language, and you haven't done a thing!
Well, the night is young.
Oh, you're wicked!
Cory.
Listen, Shawn.
I am getting to know Rosie, okay?
Maybe I just move a little slower than you.
Well, move a little faster.
They're only here on a six month visa.
See?
I told you about that one.
Mmm-hmm.
You were right.
I'm just worried about Topang Please, for one night, I beg of you, there is no Topang.
If you care about me at all, and even if you don't care about me but could someday care about me, then go.
Okay, okay.
Now, if memory serves, the point I was trying to make was Well, I guess we should kiss now.
I suppose we could.
We don't have to.
We can.
Do I make you sad?
No, no.
I think you're very delightful.
And I think you speak English quite well.
Thank you.
It's just that I've been going out with this girl for, like, 16 years.
Kill you!
A girl named Topanga.
Come here.
You see, we first met when we were eight-months-old in a sandbox.
She was your first girlfriend, then?
I'm pretty sure.
And, you know, I always thought we were meant to be together for the rest of our lives, but two weeks ago, she moved to Pittsburgh, and I never got a chance to say goodbye and that I love her.
And, you know, what if I never get a chance to tell her?
Will she know?
That is the most beautiful and heartfelt thing I have ever heard.
Thank you.
Would you mind very much if I cried my eyes out just right now?
Would it be okay if I cried with you?
That would be wonderful.
Thank you.
Well, he seems to be quite the rushy boy, too.
Yeah, well, I taught him everything he knows.
Cory, dinner.
Come on.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Get you out of the rain.
Is it raining?
Hey, Mommy, Daddy, I found this wounded puppy outside.
Can we keep him?
Can we?
Cory, I know this is tough on you, son, but you can't go on avoiding life.
You know something, Cor?
He's absolutely right.
I had the same problem when I broke up with Francesca.
There was a lot of pain, there was a lot of heartache, but eventually time stepped in and I got over my devastating loss.
Who's Francesca?
There is no Francesca.
I'm just trying to help.
Nobody wants that.
Okay.
Listen, Cor, I was thinking.
Why don't we just drive down to Pittsburgh this weekend, huh?
I need to see some suppliers, and you can spend some time with Topanga.
I don't think that's the best idea, Alan.
Mom, you know what?
I know how you feel, okay?
You've made it real clear how you feel.
My feelings are for you.
I don't want you to be in pain.
No.
You just don't want me and Topanga to be together.
I don't want you to be sick over Topanga.
Cor, she isn't here anymore.
And to tell you the truth, I think this presents you with a good opportunity to get to know other girls.
Mom, I don't want to know other girls, okay?
See, I don't think that's healthy.
Topanga and I would've been together for the rest of our lives.
No, you wouldn't have been.
You both have to get to know other people to make a choice like that.
I had relationships with four other men before I met your father.
Ma!
I know three.
Well, you know what, Mom, I'm sure you'll be real happy to know that I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh, okay?
Why not?
You and Topanga have a fight?
No.
No fight.
I just realized that I'm the one making all the phone calls.
I'm the one writing all the letters, but I will not be the one who travels 300 miles to be rejected and look like a fool.
So if life doesn't want me and Topanga together, then you can't fight life, can you?
Cory.
Topanga!
Aren't you going to hug me?
Well, you know, wet and everything.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
Hi, Topanga.
Hi, honey.
Do your parents want to come in?
Actually there are no parents.
So your parents dropped you off?
I'm betting no.
I couldn't be without you.
I wasn't doing too good either.
Topanga, your parents don't know you're here, do they?
No.
No, they don't.
Topanga, your parents are going to be very worried about you.
Why would they be worried about me now?
They weren't worried about me when they decided to move.
I told them how much Cory meant to me and how I couldn't be away from him.
They said I was too young to say things like that, that I didn't know.
So you ran away from them?
I ran away to Cory.
Okay.
It just got serious now.
Topanga, I'm going to have to call them.
No, Mom.
Didn't you hear what she just said?
Her parents don't understand her, okay?
Just like you two don't understand me.
We want to be together.
Okay?
That's what we want.
Topanga, I know you miss Cory, but to come here without your parents' permission, that's just wrong.
How can it be wrong, Mom, if she loves me enough to do that?
I mean, I'm sorry I didn't do it myself.
Help me, Alan.
First of all, we are not the enemy.
We understand that you two want to be together, but this is not the way to go about it.
I'm calling.
Listen, I promise no one is going to take you away from me.
I promise.
We have to.
So the first day we didn't connect was Monday, but I figured you were busy with school and you had a lot of other stuff to do, but then we missed Tuesday and Wednesday, and I started wondering who were you with?
Cory, I could've sat and talked to you on the phone every day, but it was just the phone, and every time I hung up it got harder for me.
I just tried to stay busy.
Well, does busy include going to the school dance with your new friends?
How'd you know?
It was a guess.
It was just something to do.
And I had a lousy time because all I thought about was you.
You missed a phone call or two.
What were you up to?
Listen, if I missed a phone call, it was because I was out at the mailbox checking for a letter.
Hey, Cory!
The Sparrow sisters called.
They want to see us again.
Hey, Topanga.
Naturally, I told them you were married.
So the Sparrow sisters.
They were in your mailbox, were they?
Trust me.
I love you.
I know you do.
I love you, too.
Okay, your hair's wet, you're wearing Cory's clothes.
You ran away, didn't you?
She gets that from me.
Hey, she ran away!
Bad, bad, bad girl!
We called your folks, Topanga, to let them know that you're here and that you're all right.
And later on And later on, what, Mom?
She's going back to her house?
Then, fine.
I'm going with her.
We can do this again there.
Cory, you live here.
Topanga lives in Pittsburgh.
I didn't do it.
Stop jumping on me.
No, no, Mom.
I'm not jumping on you because of where we live.
All right?
I'm jumping on you because you seem happy about this.
I mean, why don't you want us to be together?
I hear yelling.
Eric, upstairs.
No, no, I hear yelling.
I'm not involved.
I'm staying.
You cannot make adult life decisions without adult life experiences behind those decisions to make them stand up.
Mom, I love her.
So you say, Cory.
But what does love mean to you at 16-years-old?
I have been with your father for 22 years, and I am just now beginning to realize what love really means.
Wait right there.
Was I a big surprise?
Okay, Cory, you educate me.
You tell me what love means to you.
Mom, listen, I haven't been together with Topanga for 22 years, but we have been together for 16, okay?
That's a lot longer than most couples have been together.
I mean, when we were born, you told me that we used to take walks in our strollers together around the block.
When we were two, we were best friends.
I knew everything about this girl.
I knew her favorite color.
I knew her favorite food.
Then we got to be six, and Eric made fun of me because it wasn't cool to have a best friend that's a girl or to even know a girl.
Yeah, and you listened to me.
Idiot.
So for the next seven years, I threw dirt at her.
I like to call those the lost years.
You were the one who made him throw dirt at me?
You were a girl, noogiehead.
Then when I was 13, Mom, she put me up against my locker, and she kissed me.
I mean, she gave me my first kiss.
She taught me how to dance.
She always was talking about these crazy things, and I never understood a word she said.
All I understood was that she was the girl I sat up every night thinking about.
And when I'm with her, I feel happy to be alive, like I can do anything.
Even talk to you like this.
So that's what I think is love, Mom.
When I'm better because she's here.
And now she won't be.
So I'm finished.
I think it's a good thing that Cory's the only boy I've ever loved.
I was looking forward to doing all the things that people do who are in love with Cory.
And not with just some guy in Pittsburgh because I'm there.
Well, should I call the caterers?
Never mind.
They're here.
No.
That would be Topanga's aunt.
My aunt?
Aunt Prudence?
Your parents said they were going to call her.
Hey, maybe she'll be on our side.
No, not my aunt.
Well, maybe she'll realize that we're Romeo and Juliet.
We belong together.
Look, my aunt has never been in love, never been married, and wouldn't even know who Romeo and Juliet were.
Hello.
I'm Topanga's aunt.
Okay.
Now, how's that possible?
Because my aunt looks like an elephant.
That is my sister you're talking about.
She does, man.
Hi.
I'm Alan Matthews.
This is my wife, Amy.
Prudence Curtis.
Hello, Topanga.
Aunt Pru.
And this must be the young man who has my niece so smitten.
Hi, uh, I'm Cory Matthews.
Listen, you're my last chance.
Please don't take her away.
I'm sorry, Cory, but my instructions are to take Topanga home with me and put her on the train to Pittsburgh, first thing in the morning.
Cory, help.
Topanga, I don't know what to do, okay?
Everyone seems to want us apart.
Except dad.
Dad, listen, you really haven't said anything during this whole time.
Are you going to let her take her away?
I don't think I'm going to have to.
What?
Well, you know, you may have known Topanga since you were born, but I've known your mother, like, forever, okay?
So?
So What I know about your mother, besides her favorite food and color, spaghetti and red, and the thing that I respect in her the most is that she has always put her faith in love, when she sees it, when she recognizes it.
Which is why she chose me when her parents told her not to.
Yeah, but, Dad, she wants us to have other relationships.
Love is faith, Cory.
Do you love your mother?
Yeah, of course I do.
Then have faith.
It would be wrong for Topanga to go back to Pittsburgh.
Guess I have a lot to learn.
Certainly you're not suggesting that I let some puppy love between two 16-year-old children interfere with her parents' wishes?
I am suggesting that Topanga was born in Philadelphia and has spent her entire life here.
All of her friends, everything she knows is here.
And to rip her out of high school in her junior year and drag her to Pittsburgh where she has to make new friends for one year, and then have to leave again for college is irresponsible.
Are you saying that my sister and brother-in-law are irresponsible?
Yes, I am.
Then keep talking.
I have known Topanga for 16 years, too.
It's hard not to love her.
Everything Cory says she is, she is.
And no matter how old Cory is, it will be hard for him to find better.
Mom.
You're my son.
I never want you to be in pain.
Topanga, Cory, would you excuse us so that I may speak to Mr. and Mrs. Matthews?
Oh, I'm staying.
Mr. Matthews, Miss Lawrence.
No, no.
This isn't the classroom, Mr. Matthews.
As you were.
Even though this isn't the classroom at the moment, would you mind if I taught you a lesson anyway?
Please.
Believe it or not, there was a time in my life when I cared for someone as deeply as you two care for each other now.
You believe we love each other?
And for no reason I understood, my wife was taken from me, and I haven't been so deeply in love since.
Feeny believes we love each other.
I believe that when you find love, you hold onto it and cherish it, because there is nothing finer, and it may never come again.
And that, my dears, is the most important thing that I could teach you.
Who is that guy?
That's Mr. Feeny.
He knows everything.
No, he doesn't.
Beg your pardon?
Prudence Curtis.
I'm Topanga's aunt.
George Feeny.
I'm Topanga's teacher.
Well, I don't know that I appreciate what you're teaching these children, sir.
To plant wild ideas about true love in young undeveloped minds is as irresponsible as my sister and brother-in-law ripping her from the only environment she's ever known at this delicate time.
Madam, if you choose to question my opinions, then you disregard 38 years in the public school system where I have borne the responsibility of those opinions for 30,000 students, none held in higher regard than Mr. Matthews and Miss Lawrence.
You like me?
Stay out of this.
The only thing I presume, sir, is that you are as verbose as you are snappy.
Well, then There we are.
Topanga, your aunt has something to tell you.
I have spoken to your parents, and while I don't condone the intensity or exclusivity of this relationship, I also cannot condone the actions of my sister and brother-in-law.
Therefore I've decided, and they have agreed, that if you'd like to live with me during the remainder of your high school education, I'd be happy to have you.
I'm verbose?
Did you hear what she said?
Yeah, she said you're staying here.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hope I'm not getting mixed signals here.
'Cause I'd hate to think the fact that you're a few years older than me is putting you off.
I mean, what is age, really?
Just shut up.
You're winning.
Well, in that case, what's your tomorrow look like?
Ooh.
Three days in a row.
Well, I don't know.
That's starting to sound kind of serious.
I mean, how well do we know each other, really?
Okay.
Well, let's start with me.
Well, that's pretty much it.
Now tell me about yourself.
I wanna know everything.
Everything?
Yeah, everything.
Okay.
Uh Why don't we go back to my place?
Yay.
Eric, if you're gonna have a relationship with me, there's somebody else that you're gonna have to have a relationship with as well.
This is Diana.
Oh, no.
This is too good to be true.
You're vampires, aren't you?
Okay, go ahead.
No, no.
Diana is the babysitter.
Ooh, role-playing.
Okay, I wanna be the commander-in-chief of the allied armies.
No, Diana is my babysitter.
Ah!
Okay, I get it, yeah.
Diana's my babysitter.
Hi, Mommy!
Oh.
Uh, Mommy, that would be, like Eric, I would like for you to meet my son Ryan.
You know, Cor, I think I'm developing quite a knack for these scholastic aptitude tests or as I prefer to call them, SATs.
Okay, okay, here's another one.
Verbal.
It's how you talk and stuff.
Keep 'em coming.
No, Shawn, listen to the question, okay?
Okay.
"Perigee is to apogee "as zenith is to A, nadir, "B, cortex, or C, sulfur"?
Uh A, nadir.
I'm right, aren't I?
Yeah.
First two times I took the SATs, put down sulfur and cortex, and we saw how well that worked for me.
So a third date with Kelly tonight.
How'd it go?
Uh, she took me back to her apartment.
Wow!
Details.
Okay, nice apartment, hardwood floors, little kid, overlooking the park.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Eric.
How did she get an apartment overlooking the park?
Cor, I said she has a kid.
Now, does she get the afternoon sun and everything?
Cory, Cory, Cory, Cory, if I'm gonna involve you in these adult conversations, you're gonna have to pick up on little key phrases like "she has a kid.
" A kid, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that kind of complicates things, doesn't it?
Yeah.
I mean, I guess, but we really like each other.
That's all that matters, right?
I mean, she's out in the real world.
So am I. Got a good job, got me a nice house.
I frankly think I'm ready for an adult relationship.
Well, that's great.
So what do Mom and Dad think?
I'm too scared to tell 'em.
Eric.
Hi, Kelly.
Flowers.
Oh, thank you.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Come in.
Come in.
Thanks.
Wow.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Why not?
Well, it's just that when most guys find out about I'm not most guys.
See, I I have a little brother and a little sister, you know?
I'm used to being around kids.
I love kids.
Having a kid brother and sister of your own is a little bit different than being around someone else's kid.
Ryan isn't someone else's kid.
Ryan's your kid.
I can't wait to get to know him, too.
I'm so glad I met you, Eric Matthews.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Mommy!
Hello, sir.
Sir?
No, buddy, it's Eric.
Remember, I met you the other night?
Well, he gets a little shy around new people.
Well, not around me.
Hey, tell you what.
Why don't you and me go out, we'll grab a burger?
We'll even take your mom.
Mommy, wanna come with us?
Well, I suppose, but you gotta put your sweater on first, mister.
I don't wanna.
Ryan, I'm not asking you.
Put your sweater on.
No.
You know something, buddy, I happen to know something about this sweater I bet you you don't.
This sweater was made by a magic genie.
Are genies still hot?
Keep going.
So this genie made this sweater special, and anybody who wears it can fly.
Gimme a break.
Fine.
Don't fly.
Take the bus.
Yeah, sure.
Kids like buses.
There we are.
See?
This sweater isn't magic.
I can't You're flying!
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!
Whee!
Uh-oh.
We've got engine failure.
We're going down.
Do it again.
All right, children, Mommy's hungry.
Let's go.
All righty.
Oh, I know this really nice restaurant.
I don't know about kids in nice restaurants.
Oh, don't worry about this place.
While some may see it as elegant and romantic others see it as the perfect place for kids.
Can I go play that pinball machine?
Well, sure.
I just happen to have a pocket full of quarters here.
Thanks, Eric.
You're welcome, buddy.
Okay.
What's wrong with you?
What, the quarters?
I do my own laundry.
No.
You say all the right things, you're good with Ryan, you are cute as heck, and you're not running away.
Where would I run to that's better than this?
See?
Stop saying those good things.
Well, I'm sorry.
It's the truth.
I mean, all the girls I've dated, they seem so young, you know?
They're still trying to figure out what they want to do with their lives.
You, you're well-grounded.
You have a kid.
I mean, you're responsible for a whole 'nother life.
Well, having Ryan has definitely been a blessing in my life, but at this point in your life, is that something that you want?
That's where my life is going.
So Tell me about your family.
Ooh, my family.
Okay, um Well, I have a younger brother, Cory, and I really like the kind of guy he's turning into.
You know, I really like hanging out with him now.
Hey, Eric.
Not now.
Get out of here.
Where's the baby?
Get out of here now.
Hi, Kelly.
I'm Cory, and this is Shawn.
No, really.
Where's the baby?
What?
I think it's a valid question.
He's back there at the pinball machine.
Oh, do you mind if I go over there and play with the baby?
He's okay.
So, listen, Eric.
Me and Shawn are going to a movie.
You guys wanna come?
Oh, definitely.
How about it, Kell?
I've gotta get Ryan to bed, but you guys go ahead.
Eric, listen.
You do not wanna miss this one, okay?
It's Jim Carrey and Steven Seagal starring in What Are You Doing In My Movie?
Yeah, but it's all about priorities, Cor, and, frankly, mine are changing, so If you don't mind, I'd like to come home with you and maybe read Ryan a story.
He'd like that.
If angle A has a sine of 30 degrees, what is the cosine of angle B?
Oh I You did that just so we could be alone?
Mmm, why would you say that?
Oh, the ear thing.
Hey, you take those SATs six or seven times, you start losing that lovin' feeling.
You know what, Eric?
Maybe the eighth time's a charm for you.
I mean, why don't you, you know, improve your scores, take the SATs again?
You could go to college.
I mean, you are still thinking about college, right?
Mmm, maybe I'll get around to it, but right now, I'm happy with my life.
I mean, I got a good job, good girl, good kid.
Yeah, my life is coming together.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, Dad.
How was your night?
Okay, I'm gonna go now.
Your dad is scaring me.
No, no, no.
You don't have to go anywhere.
Everything is just fine.
Good night, Topanga.
Bye-bye.
I'm coming, too.
You, stay.
I thought you guys were going out.
Oh, we did.
We got about three blocks, and then the funniest thing happened, except it really wasn't that funny.
We ran out of gas.
Now, who had that car last?
Good question, Amy.
I think I know the answer.
Could it be Cory?
We got a little rule around this house, Cor.
I'm sure you know.
He who has the car last fills the tank with gas.
Yes, I know, sir, but I'm sorry, because I forgot.
Well, you're about three blocks too late for sorry.
No car for a week.
Do you know, he could have at least let me explain.
Why?
What'd you have?
Nothing.
I got nothing.
You know, Cor, I was once a son myself.
I'll go in there and try to straighten it out for you, okay?
Thanks, Eric.
Great.
Oh, Dad, I can't believe the way Cory was laughing at you behind your back.
Whoop, there's Kelly.
Better get going.
Whoa, wait a minute.
You guys have been going out for a while, and we still haven't met her.
You should invite her to come in.
Uh, you know, Mom, we're really in a hurry.
Kelly, hon, come on in!
You know something?
We're really in a rush.
What's the matter?
Afraid I'll say something to embarrass you?
Hi.
I'm Kelly.
Attaboy!
Hi.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Amy.
This is Alan.
Hello, Kelly.
Hi.
Oh, and this is Ryan.
He's my son.
Uh, did you hear that, Amy?
They've got a son.
It's very nice to meet you, both of you.
So, can I get anyone a drink?
A, uh Juice box?
Eric, why didn't you tell them?
Um, it's easy.
Mom, Dad, Ryan.
Ryan, Mom, Dad.
Now that we've all met, laser tag.
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews, this is my son.
His name is Ryan.
He's six years old.
He's in the first grade, and he is the love of my life.
Did I hear laser tag?
Can I come, too?
Well, actually, honey, they're kind of on a date.
So?
She's bringing her brother.
She's my mom.
Well, then I'll bring my mom.
Okay, whoever wants to come can come, but for the love of God, no more talking, okay?
Well, it was very nice meeting you all, but we should get going.
But I hope to see you guys again.
It was very nice to meet you, Kelly, and you're welcome here anytime.
Sorry I thought your mom was your sister.
It's okay.
Happens all the time.
Come on, kid.
You know, Eric, why is Dad going so nuts on me about this whole car thing?
You?
He's been all over me about Kelly, and it's only been five dates.
It's not like I'm planning my big June wedding or anything.
Yeah.
You're wearing a tuxedo.
What are you saying?
Eric, listen, why don't you take the SATs, okay?
We could take them together, you know, help each other out.
Ah, my little Cory with your get-smart-quick schemes.
No, my friend, for me, the good ship S.S. SAT has sailed.
So that's it, huh?
No college.
It's not like I'm ruining my life or anything.
I'll just move on to what I would've done after college.
Secret Service guy?
You read my secret dossier?
What?
Good night, guys.
Cory.
Hope you understand why I took away your driving privileges.
Yes, Dad.
I completely understand.
So can I have the car tomorrow night?
You're kidding, right?
No.
It's been a couple days.
Why not?
I mean, why can't I have the car tomorrow night?
I said a week.
And I said I was sorry.
Am I not being clear?
A week!
Take off my tuxedo.
Oh, but I'm so cute.
You know, between the two of you guys, I got Nothing.
You know, he is taking this Dad stuff way too seriously.
You know something, Cor, I've learned something in all the time I've spent with Ryan.
The key to a successful father-son relationship is friendship, communication, and trust.
And occasionally, you throw in a Tootsie Roll.
So what do we do now?
What do we do now?
We sit now, buddy, if that's okay.
I think sitting's the only thing we haven't done all day.
Can we go to the zoo?
Go to the zoo?
We already went to the zoo.
Remember, I had to jump into the ocelot cage to get your Sixers hat from the game we went to?
You were scared.
You ran fast.
Yeah, well, I thought the ocelot was part of the gerbil organization.
They were leopards.
Yeah, I know they're leopards, but you told me they were gerbils.
I did.
Yeah.
That's funny, huh?
And that is why we're sitting now, buddy.
I don't mind sitting.
You're gonna sit with me, right?
Yeah, pal.
I'm gonna sit with you.
Hey, Eric.
Oh, hey, it's the baby!
Aren't you adorable!
You get a Tootsie Roll.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, Topanga.
Me and Cory against you, and you are going dow-how-hown!
Oh, well, that's real fair.
Eric, you wanna be on my team?
Topanga, I take my babysitting responsibilities pretty seriously.
One quick game.
Can I?
You said you were gonna be with me.
Oh, I am gonna be with you, buddy.
I just wanna play one quick game with them.
Can I be on your team?
Actually, you're still a little too short to see over the table there, pal.
You'd rather be with them?
No.
It's just that I've been with you all day, buddy.
It's okay.
You can go play with them.
Hey, you are the coolest, buddy.
Tootsie, huh?
Okay.
I'll break.
So, Eric, what'd you and your baby do today?
Oh, we did just about everything there is to do in the world.
Cory, you have no idea how adult you look to me right now.
Can I have some ice cream, please?
Ice cream?
Sure, buddy.
Not a problem.
Here you go.
Thanks.
For everything.
You're welcome, pal.
Eric, it's your shot.
My shot.
All right.
So, when are you guys actually taking your SATs?
A week from Saturday.
I thought he knew.
Actually, I told him that there were no SATs, and that Saturday was just cake day at school, and perhaps some creme brulee.
Mmm!
Okay, why don't we do this?
Why don't we do the 10-ball in whatever pocket it decides to go into, all right?
Come on, Ryan!
Come check this shot out, my friend.
Ry?
Ryan?
Where'd he go?
The baby's gone?
I yelled at him.
I can't believe I yelled at him.
Eric, it's fine.
He's in bed.
He's sleeping.
It's over.
I flipped out.
I found him sitting outside on the curb and I started screaming at him.
I took my eye off him for one minute, one minute, and anything could've happened.
How do you do this every day?
I do it because I love him and because he's my son.
Eric, you're the one with the choice here.
You know, I was with him all day.
I just wanted a minute to myself and he got so upset.
Yeah, but he's not upset at you.
He's upset at not having a full-time father every minute of every day, you know, to make up for what he lost.
He needs so much.
Yeah, he does.
Eric, you are gonna be such a great dad.
But when you're ready.
Just because I'm a mom doesn't mean that you have to be a dad.
Kelly, I'm not looking to get out of this.
I know that, Eric.
But listen to me.
You still have so many options available to you in your life.
Take advantage of them.
Eric, you know I'm right.
You're dumping me.
No.
I just think that the fair thing would be to get out of this before anybody gets too attached.
I see.
I let you down.
No.
No, Eric.
The only way you could've let me down is if you had stuck around just to be a nice guy.
You wouldn't have been happy.
Neither would we.
Kelly, I'm not looking to get out of this.
Well, you know where we live.
Mommy, I need you!
I gotta go, Eric.
Bye.
The forecast, mostly sunny skies today, with brisk easterly winds, expect a high Yes.
Hey, Mommy, Daddy, how you doing?
Look at you two.
Watching TV.
Ooh, these eyes.
Be nice to look at something other than a book, don't you know?
We know you took the car.
Uh, sorry, guys.
Listen, my friends needed a ride.
You weren't around.
It was late I don't care.
I told you a week.
You took it anyway.
You just bought yourself two weeks.
Dad!
My friends needed a ride, okay?
It was late.
Why are you treating me like a kid?
'Cause you are a kid.
Eric, this is none of your business, okay?
You know something?
You're right.
It's not, because I am not a dad.
But I do know he's got a tough time raising us, and I know that we don't make it any easier.
You think he likes yelling at us?
You think he likes when you do something wrong?
He doesn't.
He hates it.
And he can't keep his eye on us every second.
Now, go to your room!
Dad, are you gonna let him just Go to your room.
Well, maybe you are ready to be a dad.
Hmm.
She dumped me.
I'm gonna go upstairs and study for my SATs.
Hi.
How are you two this evening?
Well, you're home a little late this evening.
Yes, we are.
Isn't that interesting?
Cory, don't make a big deal of it.
No, no, no.
I just wanna know.
Who had the car last?
Him.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Dad did, don't you know?
Cory, let it go.
No, no, no.
I just wanna know what happened to that house rule.
Um, you know, the one that goes, "Whoever had the car last puts gas in the tank.
" Sorry, Cor.
I forgot.
Well, Alan, you're about seven blocks late for sorry.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You're out with your girlfriend.
You legitimately run out of gas.
You push the car back seven blocks just to yell at me?
No.
I just wanted to explain why we were home so late and to say thank you.
Cory!
And thank you, too.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
What do you mean, forfeit?
My team doesn't know the meaning of the word forfeit.
Look, High School Quiz Show has been on the air for 36 years.
We are an institution.
We've always had three players per team.
We're not about to change that now.
But the bus broke down.
It's not their fault that the bus broke down.
Well, then how did she get here if the bus broke down?
Well, she was driven over by Hey, Mr. Feeny.
Look, we're smart.
Okay, we forfeit.
Boys, where do you go to high school?
Forfeit!
I said we forfeit!
We go to, um Hey, Cory, who's that guy?
What, the head in the hallway?
Yeah.
That's John Adams' head.
We go to John Adamshead High School.
Which is why we forfeit, you see.
Let's get them into makeup.
Oh, no.
For the love of God, no.
And now back to High School Quiz Show with your host Arthur Kandib.
Thank you, Mr. Prong.
All right, teams, for one point, "The region known as the Fertile Crescent lies between which two rivers"?
Yes, Ms. Lawrence for John Adams.
He said "fertile.
" The answer is the Tigris and the Euphrates.
Yeah, nice try, Topanga.
Idiot.
That is correct.
All right!
Yeah.
You suck!
And with the score.
Hamilton High, 20, and John Adams High, 1 We will not be denied!
We mercifully take a break for these few kind words from our good sponsors at the world of knowledge.
And we're off.
Will you look at that?
If you'll allow me to go on camera, I will apologize to your audience.
What are you, kidding?
I've never seen the audience into the show like this as long as I've worked here.
I don't understand.
Oh, I think I do.
See, for the past the teams have been composed of bookish academic types.
See, but your team They have a certain Educational deficiency?
No, but I was going to say they're cute.
They're fun to watch.
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm Brett Mclnerny with Oahu Beach Face Saver Pads.
Oh, hi, I think you're in the wrong studio.
Uh, no.
I think I am in the right studio.
John Adams rocks!
You know, I like what you are doing with your show.
If you're going to keep it this way, I think that Oahu Beach Face Savers may spend some advertising money.
Got it.
Excuse me.
Thirty seconds.
Okay, look, I have worked very hard to be on this team, you two just happen to be here.
So I would really appreciate it if you would stop pushing the buzzer just because you like the sound.
Okay, fine, Miss Smarty-Pants, if you feel that you can do better than us, then the buzzer is yours.
Sorry.
Last time.
Ten seconds.
Here are the questions.
No, I already have them.
No, the new questions.
In three, two, one.
And we're back with my favorite part of the program, "The fast-paced, electrically-charged, lightning round "where the questions are worth " "Two points.
" "And the category "Whazzup"?
"What does the 'X' in X-Men stand for"?
Oh, go ahead.
The "X' in X-Men stands for the mysterious gene factor, which manifests itself as a mutant ability, such as the healing factor of Wolverine or the ability to manipulate the weather in Storm.
Dr. Matthews.
My esteemed colleague is correct.
Although he overlooks the amusing coincidence of the "X" in X-Men also standing for Professor Charles Xavier, the founder of the X-Men and the most powerful mutant mind on the planet.
"Most powerful mutant mind on the planet.
" Yes, that's exactly what I have.
Mom, Dad, you are now looking at the new champion of High School Quiz.
I thought you and Shawn just went down to support Topanga?
We did, but we made it on the team.
I hope you guys will come down next time we're on.
Finally someone understands my particular genius.
No, whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean you're champion of the High School Quiz?
Don't they ask really tough questions?
Ha, maybe for you.
Alan, I used to watch High School Quiz Show when I was a kid.
I remember all the contestants were really smart.
Are you asking me why Cory's on this show?
Yeah.
George?
We live in a random and chaotic universe.
It's Knowledge Fever with the Knowledge Fever Brain Cell dancers, your humble announcer, Milton Prong and your host, Sweet Artie "K".
Okay, then.
Welcome to the show that makes learning hip, hot, and happening.
Oahu Beach Face Savers presents Knowledge Fever.
Our returning champions are in the house, so let's give it up for John Adams High School.
And the challengers, three smart kids from some other school.
And now, let's get down with the first round, and the category Oh, what a surprise!
"The lifeguards of Baywatch.
" I haven't Pamela Anderson plays sexy lifeguard C.J. Parker.
Sexy lifeguard C.J. Parker is correct for one million points.
And with the score John Adams High School, one million.
And their future employers zero.
Let's pause for a few words from our sponsor because that's the way the world works.
* Covered with spots, you're lookin' real bad * You've tried some creams, but you think you've been had * Girls only kiss you Life is the pits * You could be the mac If you didn't have zits * Oahu And my mom said I watch too much television.
Yeah, well, we're showing them.
Hey, guys, what are we showing them?
I mean, we're answering questions about TV and comic book trivia.
Does it really make us feel intelligent?
It is why we are the returning champions.
Yeah.
Let's get our priorities straight.
And we're back with round two.
So, between me and you, these John Adams kids, they're never going to lose, right?
Ren's the dog, Stimpy's the cat, Rocko's a wallaby.
And for the bonus points, Honker Burger.
Is correct for three million points and the game.
And we'll be right back after this word from the man.
I don't understand what kind of audience they're trying to impress with this show.
Rocko's a wallaby.
It's the stuff I don't know.
Now I get it.
Cory.
Cory, just to add a little drama, before you answer, do you think you could mop your brow and scrunch up your face like you're not sure of the answer?
Yes.
Like this?
Perfect.
Okay.
Shawn, how about you flashing some of those thoughtful, pouty, sexy lips?
Thoughtful, pouty, sexy lips?
What sense does that make?
I understand exactly.
She means this.
Yeah.
Okay.
And, Topanga, let's see, let me see you tousle your hair and just flirt with that camera a little.
May I just say that I'm not really comfortable with all of this.
I mean, before we had questions that required real knowledge, and, sure, they were tough, but they made us think.
And I thought that was the whole point of the show.
Well, the point of the show is to attract an audience.
I suggest you look at your audience.
It's good to be queen.
So, Gutenberg invented the printing press making the written word available to the masses.
For the first time in history, the common man had access to the same information that used to be available only to the privileged few.
And who would you like me to make this out to, my darling?
Gentlemen!
Might I interrupt your press junket?
There's some learning going on here.
Maybe you feel it's important to learn that Gutenberg invented the printing press, but pop culture and these pouty lips have made me a star.
I'm going to try and put this as kindly as possible.
The show has turned into a circus, and you three are driving the tiny car.
Look, Mr. Feeny, I mean, I'm proud that I knew that Krusty the Clown was the son of a rabbi.
I answered a real question, Mr. Feeny, about the Tigris and the Euphrates.
Miss Lawrence, I would never deny you your moment in the sun, but Knowledge Fever no longer has much to do with the kind of knowledge I would want you to absorb.
Mr. Feeny, look, the show's proving that we're absorbing the right type of knowledge, right?
I mean, that's why we're the champions.
Hold it, hold it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Champions of what, Mr. Matthews?
Of a generation whose verbal and mathematical skills have sunk so low, when you have the highest level of technology at your fingertips?
Gutenberg's generation thirsted for a new book every six months.
Your generation gets a new web page every six seconds.
And how do you use this technology?
To beat King Koopa and save the Princess.
Shame on you.
You deserve what you get.
Sit down!
Stay where you are.
For the first time, I choose to walk out on you.
Oahu Beach Face Saver Pads presents, Huh!
That's Cool!
With the Oahu Beach dancers, yours truly Milton Prong and your stern but groovy mistress Kiki.
Let's hear it for Kiki.
Aloha!
First, our challengers.
Straight-A averages, but not much of a tan.
Let them know how you feel about them from right here in Philly, it's Einstein Academy.
And now our returning champions.
Let's have an Oahu Beach welcome for Lips, Hair, and Brainiac-14.
Here are the questions for round one.
Oh, thank you, big kahuna.
Johnny Adams, "The Earth has one natural satellite.
"It's called the moon.
"A single lunar phase takes 28 days to complete "and involves phases such as the waning gibbous and the waxing gibbous.
" For 800 million points, the moon, where is it?
Yeah!
Is right for Albert Einstein, that same moon, which John John Adams so precisely located as to its exact position in the universe, that same moon, what does it weigh?
The exact weight of the moon is 81 quintillion tons.
I'm sure it is.
However, it's not exactly the answer we're looking for.
John Adams?
It doesn't weigh anything 'cause, well, if it did, it would fall on us.
Is right!
Yeah!
They were right, and you were wrong, which can only mean one thing Audience?
Samoans!
* Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
That's Cool!
* Huh!
That's Cool!
will be right back.
* Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
That's Cool!
* Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
That's Cool!
* Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
That's Cool!
* Huh!
Huh!
Huh!
That's Cool!
* And we're out.
Hey, kids, this is Brett Mclnerny.
He's our sponsor.
He has some great news.
You know, because of your commitment to education, this show now reaches four times as many kids as it used to.
That's right, which means that Huh!
That's Cool!
is going to need even more of a commitment from you.
Oh, well, that's great.
What do we have to do?
Just miss a couple days of school.
How many days?
Six weeks.
Huh, that's cool.
Yeah, we're going to go on location in Oahu.
Columbus, Oahu?
No.
I don't think I can go.
Oh, excuse me?
Six weeks from school?
We have finals coming up.
My grades have been suffering as it is.
Yeah, Miss Kellybacker.
You know, we're having fun and everything, but do you think we could think about it if that's okay?
Oh, yeah, you should definitely think about it.
But I also want you to think about how you have become scholastic role models for millions of kids out there.
So, let's get in the bathing suits, and let's get ready for round two, huh?
Okay.
Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Brainiac.
I suppose it's too much to hope that you've prepared for tomorrow's class.
Gutenberg invented his printing press in 1450 and made knowledge available to the mass culture who could now communicate about shared literary experiences.
Hmm.
Please don't tell anyone I know that.
And Cory and Shawn and I have discussed it, and we think you should ask us some intelligent questions, too.
Oh, why?
Whatever for?
So there could be some educational value on the show.
Like there used to be.
Okay.
Darling, here's some educational value.
See, no one watched the show when we asked intelligent questions.
Now they watch the show, so I think we're doing the right thing, okay?
Yeah, but don't you think we should do a smart show if so many kids watch?
This is an outrageous star demand.
Is this the thanks I get for making you famous?
Actually, nobody recognizes me without my brain head.
So, all three of you feel like this?
Shawn?
Shawn, come on.
You're a good-looking guy.
Who cares what kind of questions we ask or what you know as long as you come off looking cute, popular, and you win?
I'll have to think about that.
Okay.
You do that.
In any case, we were prepared for this.
What do you think she meant by that?
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
It's hot.
It's steamy.
It's Oahu Beach.
And now, here's the woman that put the "O" in Oahu.
Here's Kiki!
Whoo!
Alo-ha!
Let's have a Kiki- wiki welcome for our returning champions, Hair, Lips, and Brainiac-14.
They're not going to be any trouble, are they?
I've already taken care of it.
And now, some very special challengers from Malibu, California.
What?
Here's Viper Jones, Surfer Girl, and Moondoggie.
Uh-oh.
Well, this is too, too dramatic.
Here we are with one final question and the score is tied at one million trillion points each.
And the question goes to Lips.
You care who wins?
Good-looking kids versus good-looking kids.
This is good TV.
Okay, Lips, answer correctly and you win again.
Blow it and Malibu becomes the new champions and get a trillion million points.
So, for the whole enchilada.
Who invented the printing press and made the written word available to the masses for the first time in history?
We need an answer, Lips.
Time's up, lips.
So what's it going to be?
I don't know.
I don't really know anything.
I'm just cute and fun to watch.
Miss Lawrence.
Mr. Matthews, Mr. Hunter, you're early for my class.
Why are you early for my class?
Mr. Hunter.
Johann Gutenberg.
Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1450.
Yes, I believe I taught you that.
Mr. Matthews.
Can you teach us something else?
It's too bad we lost.
Hey, at least we got this lovely home version of the show.
Wait a second.
Where are the dancers?
Oh, they couldn't get them into the box, honey.
Okay, I'll be Kiki.
Alo-ha!
Okay, for a zillion points, Milk, where does it come from?
Cows?
Is right!
But not the answer we were looking for.
Boys.
A carton.
More specific.
A milk carton.
Ding, ding, ding, ding!
Yeah, kids win, parents lose.
You know what that means.
Samoans!
Samoans.
* Boy, Boy, Boy Meets World * Boy, Boy, Boy Meets World * Boy, Boy, Boy Meets World, Boy *
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Look, people are lining up to get in.
That's right, Father.
Customers are aligning up Lining up because Eric Matthews called a little lady named Holly Wood and arranged for all these nice people to meet TV's bear.
What show was he on again?
Oh, I don't know.
Grizzly Adams, Gentle Ben, National Geographic.
It doesn't really matter.
See, this bear's been on TV.
He's famous.
People love that.
Excuse me, Mr. Matthews.
I'd like to take care of the business end up-front.
Oh, yeah.
Well, what did my partner and Miss Holly Wood agree on?
$2,500.
That's a lot of money.
Well, it's not just any bear.
It's a TV bear.
Well, I mean, there are a lot of people outside, and if everybody leaves with a pair of socks, I guess we're okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
The plan isn't to have those people come in here, is it?
Well, yeah, that's the whole point of the plan is have all those people come in here, meet the TV bear, and, you know, buy stuff.
Buy lots of stuff.
Well, that's not going to happen.
You see, this bear can't be around people.
That's a TV bear.
Isn't it trained?
You can't train a bear.
Eric, $2,500.
Fix this.
Now.
Okay.
Okay, I happen to have seen this very bear on an episode of Little House on the Prairie.
Well, sure, he's great with little children.
Okay, fine, then we can have the little children come in and play with the bear.
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
Didn't your partner fill you in on any of the particulars?
No.
No, he didn't.
Well, first, we need another $2,500 for the female bear.
Eric, you cost me five grand.
Yeah, but, Dad, look, I mean, we got a bear.
It's a gentle, meek TV bear.
Now you've done it.
Ralph, no.
No, down.
Eric, get out of here.
Why?
I work here.
Not anymore.
Not the shoe!
Heel!
Ow!
Alan, this isn't the first time Eric has messed up at the store.
You've given him enough chances.
You had to let him go.
Well, that's what I did, Amy.
I let him go.
I don't want you to let Eric go.
I love Eric.
No, sweetie, he's not leaving the house.
I just fired him from work.
Would you ever fire me, Dad?
Oh, never, princess.
I just hope Eric understood you.
I mean, he knows how much you love him.
You would never do anything to hurt him, but there is something called tough love, and he has to learn his lesson.
Well, Amy, I was tough.
I made it very clear to him he was fired.
Come on, Daddy-o, got to get to work early, get out that bear stink.
Whoa, whoa.
Eric, are you going to work?
Uh, Mom, yeah.
Put a little food on the table, keep you in pretty things.
Let's go, Pops.
Oh, one thing.
One thing, before I forget.
I got to take an early lunch and then not come back at all, because I met a really nice girl and I'm going to have a second lunch with her.
Working for your dad is so great.
Eric, you're fired.
Uh, yeah, came up.
Let's go, Pops.
No, Eric, I'm serious.
You're fired.
You can't fire me.
You're the mama.
I work for the dada.
Ain't that right, Dada?
Daddy?
Da?
You really don't help yourself, pal.
Here.
What's this?
It's a It's a list of colleges.
Yes, that is where I want you and Topanga to go.
Even if I'm not going to school, the three of us should still be together.
Okay, "University of Italy.
" Good old U of It.
Yep.
You guys hit the books.
You're studying hard.
Meanwhile, I'm out in the sun taking tourists around in my big canoe.
It's called a gondola.
And that is why you're going to college.
Wait, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn, Shawn.
You've worked too long to throw it all away now, okay, buddy?
Why don't you take the SATs?
I bet you'll do really well.
Fine, fine, I'll take your little test.
What's 10 minutes of my life, right?
Ten minutes?
Shawn, they take at least Shawn, listen.
You know, I bet if you take Feeny's review course, I bet you could knock them out in five, slugger.
No.
Too much school, too much Feeny.
Bye-bye.
I am going canoe shopping.
There are so many times I should've fired Eric, but I didn't.
I would have been admitting that I was a lousy boss.
Or worse, a lousy father.
Oh, Alan, how can you look at Cory and Morgan and think you're anything but the best father?
Well, then why am I having such a difficult time with Eric?
It's not like I did anything different with him.
We did everything different.
We both did.
I mean, he's our firstborn child.
We coddled him.
Oh, I didn't coddle him.
But Eric's very different than Cory and Morgan.
He needs to be protected.
You really think that's going to help him?
Yes, I do.
You really think that?
Yes.
Would you be willing to listen to someone else's opinion and not overreact?
Eric is lazy.
George, that's my son you're talking about.
Mom.
Dad.
Feeny, you know the reason I signed up for your SAT prep course is to prep, possibly even review.
But you've gone way beyond that, haven't you?
Too much work for you, Mr. Matthews?
Oh, I'll do it.
I'm not afraid of you, Feeny.
You remember that while I'm in the kitchen working and watching you.
Mom, Dad.
We'll talk to him.
He shouldn't talk to you like that.
No, no, I like his determination.
Cory works hard for his grades.
And Eric?
Eric could get passing grades in his sleep.
In fact, he did.
Which is a shame, because I'd be hard-pressed to come up with a handful of students who are brighter, wittier or smarter than Eric.
So you're saying that Eric is smart?
Mmm-hmm.
Good.
See, Alan?
Now we know we haven't come down too hard on him, and he is capable of reaching our expectations.
Why are you dressed in a security guard costume?
It's not a costume.
It's my uniform.
I finally found my calling, law enforcement.
You proud of me?
You took a job as a security guard?
Why would you possibly want to do that?
Oh, only for about 10 reasons.
One, walkie-talkie, two, partner, three, dog, four, partner.
Sometimes we switch partners.
Five, you want me to keep going?
Six, I pack heat.
You carry a gun?
Nope, a heater.
It gets cold out there in the shed.
Eric, you could do anything in your life.
Wait a second.
I don't get this.
Look, you fire me from one job, I go out, I get another job.
What do you want?
Dad, get her off my back.
No, your mother is right.
We are tired of you taking the easy way out.
From now on, the free ride is over.
Oh.
Okay, good, Mom got to you, too.
That's great, that's great.
How about you, Mr. Feeny?
What do you think?
Am I taking the easy way out?
Oh, God, not another question.
Yes, Eric, I do.
Ah.
Great.
That's great.
Well, I'd love to stay here and, you know, debate with you guys, but I'm late for work.
Oh, and another thing.
Don't wait up for me tonight.
I won't be coming home.
I'm moving out.
Okay, here he comes.
Okay, Cory, give me another one of those tough SAT questions.
Okay, here's a doozie.
Kept me up most of the night.
"Which of these ingredients "does not help you make mud?
"Dirt, "water, "or turkey"?
Turkey.
Correct.
Wow, Shawn, I didn't even know that one.
That came from Feeny's prep course?
Well, it was only one of the tougher ones.
Let me see that book.
Uh, see, Mr. Feeny?
Right here, after the question, "Which is sweeter, sugar or salt"?
Sugar.
Wow, two in a row.
Where are my glasses?
See, what we're doing, Mr. Feeny, is we're just trying to show Shawn that through your review course, a student builds a certain level of confidence through a series of not-quite questions.
It's really this basic?
Shawn, I don't want anyone misleading you.
My prep course involves a lot of hard work.
Oh, then I don't want to do it.
But it's fun.
Tell him, Mr. Feeny.
Tell Shawn about the carnival-like atmosphere of your prep course so that Shawn will join us.
No.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
I mean, if Shawn doesn't get into college, he starts washing windows, playing lotto.
Then he loses his teeth, becomes a ward of the state, and moves in with you.
Well If I tell him about the cake, well, then everyone will want to take the class.
Cake?
Yes, cake.
Delicious cake, actually, from the Westchester Bakery is where we get the cakes.
It's where we get them.
Really?
What else?
What, cake's not enough?
Fine, uh And then we have a talent show some nights.
Oh, this is amazing.
Cory, why didn't you tell me any of this?
Mr. Hunter, in between the hoopla, there will be learning going on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Cake, right?
Yes, cake.
Thanks a lot, Mr. Feeny.
You did the right thing.
I suppose.
I mean, after all, what good is it if you can't get the butts in the seats?
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Eric.
It's been a while, huh?
About 12 hours.
Yeah, you know, it seems longer when you're out on your own.
Oh, Dad, this is my partner Ronny Patell.
Hi, it's good to meet you.
Nice to meet you, Ronny.
It's a very nice store you have here.
I admire anyone who runs his own business.
One day, I hope to do the same.
Yeah, Ronny's cool.
He's letting me crash with him for a while.
We're going to be roomies.
Eric told me about your little family crisis.
I'm very sorry to hear about the mother going insane and throwing people out of the house.
You know, Ronny, why don't you look around a little bit?
Ah!
You're mad at your mother?
Yeah.
But you're not mad at me?
No.
Well, you should be.
Because as much as you messed up, I messed up even more.
I should've fired you.
I should've fired you a million times.
Dad, Dad, ease up.
We're friends.
Eric, you're a goof-off.
Well, I won't be friends with you anymore.
You want to know when I started messing up?
The day you were born.
Did you know that I was in the delivery room?
The only thing I remember is that cute nurse who slapped me on the tushie.
I remember Dr. Hodges gave me these rubber gloves to put on to keep everything safe and clean.
So I put them on, and then you were born, and you were moaning and groaning like you do now.
And I did what every father does.
I counted fingers, I counted toes.
I looked at you, and you were healthy and vital.
And I was happy, and I kissed your mom.
Why are you telling me this?
Because it's 20 years later, and I've just figured something out.
I've never taken off those gloves.
Hmm?
I have been treating you with kid gloves your entire life.
And it's not your mom's fault.
It's not Feeny's.
It's mine.
All you did was love me.
Yeah, and I do.
And I love Cory, and I love Morgan.
But because you were the firstborn, I loved you differently.
I let you get away with stuff.
I let you take advantage of me, but I did a lousy job of preparing you for the world that is out there.
Now, one day, I'm not going to be around anymore, and you're going to be on your own.
Then what?
I did not know the bosses required us to have a guard dog.
Well, actually, they don't, but I just figure with a beat as rough-and-tumble as John Adams High, we could use a little backup.
It does not appear to be very ferocious.
What?
He's a trained killer.
Isn't that right, Poppy Seed?
You're a trained killer, aren't you?
Yeah.
Yes, you are.
All right.
Listen, I know this is a sensitive subject, Eric, but your mother, is she back from the insane?
Oh, R.P., my mom's not insane.
And, actually, next time we talk, do you think you could kind of keep that between us?
Ah!
I understand.
Thanks.
So, Eric, while we wait for danger, will you help me with my studies?
Yeah, sure, what do you got there?
I'm trying to get into college, and this is the book that helps you prepare for the entrance exam.
Wait a second.
I thought you said that back home you were, like, an engineer or something.
Back home, I am an engineer, but, here, they don't know that.
I must start over, and I'm willing to.
Wait a second.
You've already gone to college, and now you want to go again?
I know it's a lot of hard work, but anything of value is worth that hard work.
And in this country, there are so many opportunities.
Look at you, fulfilling your dream of doing this job.
Security guy.
Wait a second.
You think this is my dream?
Well, it must be.
You are doing it.
Yeah, well, I mean, look at you.
You're doing it, too.
You're a security guy.
Oh, no, no, no.
I am an engineer, and soon, they will know it.
Okay, what was that?
Up, Poppy Seed.
Up, Poppy Seed.
Okay, better, you pretend to be asleep and then spring into action to save me at the last second.
Come on, R.P.
This is where your experience is needed.
Come on.
I got your back.
Okay.
Oh, hi, Mr. Feeny, okay.
You scared the hell out of me.
I scared you?
You snuck up on me.
Oh.
You know him?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's fine.
Then I'll go back to my studies.
Okay.
All right, Mr. Feeny, I still got to do this by the book.
So what are you doing at John Adams High after school hours?
SAT prep course, Mr. Matthews.
And judging from the hotbed of criminal activity raging out here, I think your time would be better spent inside with us.
Take the class?
Well No, I don't think I'm going to do that.
What are you afraid of, Eric?
I'm not afraid of anything.
No.
You're afraid of something, and it's stopping you.
Stopping me?
From what?
From becoming what we all know you're capable of being.
What I'm capable of, what I'm capable of.
You know something, Mr. Feeny, I'm always hearing that.
What I'm capable of.
I took the SATs last year, remember?
I blew them.
You know, maybe I'm just not meant to be in college.
Maybe you're someone who gives up too easily.
What'll it be, Mr. Matthews?
Who are you?
What in heaven's name?
Mr. Feeny, we've got a few issues to discuss with you.
Yeah!
We just came from taking our SATs.
Yeah!
How did you do?
Yeah!
That's why we're here, sir.
I mean, for more years than I care to remember, you have drove us nuts by filling our heads with dates and ideas and numbers and concepts.
Yeah, and with the last three weeks of that course of yours, drilling us, pushing us to the edge.
Yeah!
And making me eat cake.
Five pounds right here, baby.
And now that it's all over and we've taken the test, we had to come here and tell you to your face.
Thanks a lot, man.
We finally understood why you pushed us so hard.
We're really glad you did.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Eric.
You fired me.
I did.
Well, then I guess I deserved to be fired because I know how much you love me, and I know it must've been really hard for you to fire your son.
I'm just sorry I let you down.
Thank you, Eric.
And you, you said something wrong to me.
I was the good guy in all of this, and you turned it around, didn't you?
Good for you.
See, you said to me that there would come a time where you weren't gonna be around anymore, and that's not so.
Eric.
No, no, no, Dad.
I remember everything that you taught me.
And I'm gonna turn around, and I'm gonna teach that to my children.
So, you see, Dad, you're always gonna be around.
Well, thank you, Eric.
And I remember that one of the things that you taught me was that I could be anything that I wanted to be.
Yes, I did.
Do you still believe that?
Yes, I do.
If you don't take the easy way out and try as hard as you can.
Well, I hope you're right.
Because I tried as hard as I could.
SAT scores?
You took the test?
I did, and I thought that we should all you know, open it together.
Okay.
All right, here we go.
Now, I didn't take the easy way out.
I tried as hard as I could.
You tried as hard as you could?
Yeah, I did.
Well, then, it's a good thing you're not working for your father anymore, or I'd have to fire you.
What?
higher than last time, Eric.
I'm very proud of you.
I'm very, very proud of you.
I knew you could do it!
I knew I could do it, too.
Yes!
Mr. Feeny!
Mr. Feeny!
Mr. Feeny!
Hi.
It's me, Eric.
What are you doing now?
Well, I was sleeping.
It's something I've gotten accustomed to in the middle of the night.
That's cool.
Get dressed.
Are you crazy, man?
Yeah.
Yeah, I am.
I got this book of colleges, and I need you to help me pick out a good one, okay?
So, come on, get dressed.
Let's go.
First thing in the morning we'll go a-college pickin'.
No, no, no.
You see, Mr. Feeny, I really need your help now.
Those spaces, they're filling up fast.
How about Penbrook?
Well, actually, that's a very good school.
How about Harvard, any good?
All right, put on the coffee.
I'll meet you in the kitchen.
All right.
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
What?
I heard you told my parents you thought I was smart.
Just knowing you said that was worth about
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Lawrence, good.
Matthews, not bad.
Hunter, bad.
Turner, bell.
Wait.
Hold on.
Hold on.
You're a junior in high school now, Shawn.
You have no goals, as far as I can see.
Have you even thought about college?
I'm going to college.
Oh, you are?
Where?
Hawaii.
I figure I have a better shot outside the country.
You know, Shawn, the people who care about you in this life you can count on one hand, so don't blow me off, okay?
John, I got people who care about me.
You know, Shawn, I think Mr. Turner's right, okay.
I mean, we got one more year of high school, and the humidity in Hawaii is gonna make my hair go Whoo!
It's not good.
Well, I want to go to Penn State.
And I want to go where she goes.
Anyone surprised by that?
Whoa.
Whoa.
Okay?
Tick-tock.
Clock is moving, and you are running out of time to figure out your life.
Hey, John, you're not my guardian anymore.
I'm back with my parents.
I'll be fine.
Yeah, Shawn, but I'm one of the handful of people who cares about you, you know?
Now, your parents are busy trying to work out their marriage.
So are they.
Study hall?
Make out?
Cory!
Topanga.
And, you know, you had four years of security in these halls, but they throw you out next year, Shawn.
What are you going to do then?
Huh?
Who are you going to be?
Hi.
Hi, Sherri.
I couldn't help overhearing Turner do that number on you.
You think he was doing a number on me?
Only totally.
I mean, all that stuff about only a handful of people care about you?
I must have 100 people who care about me and care enough about me not to judge me like that in front of everybody.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was kind of embarrassing, huh?
Do you want to go grab a cup of coffee somewhere?
I'm buying, and I promise not to judge you at all.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I like girls with no judgment.
Welcome to The Centre.
Sherri.
Shawn.
Okay.
Everybody knows my name.
That's either really cool or really creepy.
You have a sense of humor.
I like that.
And yet you're not laughing.
Laughter is a mask which denies the reality of a situation and reveals nervousness.
That's funny.
So, what's up with the music?
DJ?
Live band coming?
What?
This isn't really that kind of club, Shawn.
No music?
So what kind of club is it, then?
It's more of a hangout where me and my friends get together and talk about stuff.
They're all your friends?
Yep.
And they can be yours, too, if you want.
Sure.
Sure.
I can always use more friends.
Don't know if I'm real comfortable with the hugging thing, though.
Mr. Mack says that a hug is a burst of pure love.
Then I'm bursting with pure love right now.
So who's this Mr. Mack you're always talking about?
He runs The Centre.
And he is the most remarkable human being I've ever met.
He changed my life, Shawn.
Hello, Sherri.
Are you Centered?
I'm Centered, Mr. Mack.
And how about you, Shawn?
Are you Centered?
Nope.
I'm totally off-center.
Well, we'll have to see what we can do about that.
Good luck to you.
So you're Mr. Mack?
Guilty as charged.
It's a nice place you got here.
Seems a little touchy-feely at first, but it's growing on me.
Well, it just goes to show, Shawn, you can't always go with your first instincts, Shawn.
You've got to give people a chance, Shawn.
You really like my name, don't you, Mr. Mack?
Mr. Mack.
Well, there's plenty of room in case you decide to move in.
Move in?
What, are you nuts?
This is where I live, Shawn.
We all live here.
Oh, my bad.
It's a cult.
We're just a place for people who need love in their lives.
I really have plenty of love.
Thanks anyway.
You're judging us, aren't you?
What?
The way your teachers, your family and everyone else in your life judges you.
Yeah.
I don't like that very much.
Because?
Because they don't really know me.
Hmm.
Well, why don't you get to know us before you judge us?
If you do that for us, we'll do that for you.
Seems fair.
Hey, Shawn.
Hey, hey.
What the heck are you doing?
Just saying hello.
Well, hello!
And let's never say hello like that again.
Hey, three girls.
Are you Centered, Cory?
Obviously not like you.
Oh, they're from The Centre.
They're helping me study.
I like the Centre, Cor.
Um, please excuse us, three girls.
Listen, Shawn.
Just what exactly is this Centre of which you speak?
It's not a cult.
Uh-huh.
Don't judge us, Cory.
Shawn, you're talking crazy.
I mean, you were there for what, an hour?
The length of a journey has nothing to do with its ultimate value, Shawn.
That's nice.
Cory.
Shawn, listen.
Throughout our entire friendship, we've talked about everything, right?
I mean, we've talked about girls, we've talked about movies, we've talked about music, but we've never talked about what you believe in.
I believe that I finally found a place where people let me be who I am.
You know, without trying to change me or need to know what my goals are in life.
I mean, why do I need that?
Shawn, what do you believe in?
What do you believe in, Cory?
Do you believe in a mother and a father and a comfortable house and a comfortable street because that's what you have?
Well, I don't have that, so I found something with these people.
Yeah, but who are these people?
Stop trying to take away what I have.
I don't do that to you.
We really have to be going.
You know, I have a lot of questions about this place.
Then you should check it out sometime, bud.
So, Shawn, what What is this Centre you're hanging out at?
No.
Why not?
Because I am not going to talk to you about something that you're never going to understand.
Oh, you can understand it, but somehow it's beyond me?
You're as judgmental as everybody else in my life.
First of all, you judged me, remember?
You said I couldn't understand it.
I'm Centered, you're not.
End of story.
Boy, this sounds like a real enlightened, open-minded group.
Judging.
Okay.
Why do you feel you need to be a part of this place, Shawn?
Okay.
All my life, I have felt like there was some part of me missing, and I felt like everybody could tell.
You know, like there was some hole in me, and everyone could see through it, like I wasn't finished or something.
I never saw that, Shawn.
I mean, if you would've just told me, I could've done something about it.
Let's not dwell on what people did or did not do for me.
Yes, Shawn, let's dwell on that.
That's what makes you a person.
How you relate to the people who really care about you.
The Centre is filled with people who care about me and who make me feel like a person.
The Centre is filled with lost souls who have no belief system, who are targets for some guy to bring over to his way of thinking.
The Shawn Hunter that I know is one of the most unique individuals I've ever met.
And if you let this place take away who you really are, Shawn, then you've made the worst judgment you could make.
You made the judgment.
I don't know who I am, John.
Well, this is it, Eric.
This is The Center where Shawn is.
Con men.
Fakes and charlatans, I'd say.
Which one of you brain-washed nuts validates parking?
Eric, listen.
I would not underestimate these people, okay?
I mean, they did get Shawn.
Cory, no offense to Shawn or anything, okay, but it takes a pretty weak-willed and gullible individual to succumb to this kind of blatant scam.
Hi.
I'm Alicia.
Welcome to The Centre.
Here's money.
Where's my room?
Yes, he has his conflicts.
But we're not staying, we're just here for a visit.
I understand.
You're feeling lost, alone, abandoned.
Yes.
My emotional palate is missing yellow and blue.
Where's my room?
Oh, Eric.
Eric!
No, no, no.
My new nut name is Sunflower Fortunato.
Hello.
Cory, what are you doing here?
What, no hug?
Cory, The Centre isn't the kind of place for someone like you, okay?
You have something to believe in.
I'm still looking.
You should go.
I belong here.
So that's it, huh?
You've chosen The Centre.
You're going to live here with these jujy-fruits.
You can't see through this?
Cory, I want to spend the rest of my life here.
And the beauty part is, during the winter, I can go to their tanning and hugging center in the Bahamas.
Let me tell you something, Shawn Cory, Cory, leave me alone, okay?
It's not like I'm doing drugs.
It's just like you're doing drugs, okay?
I mean, you're having your mind messed with, you're not the person I know, and everything you say is artificial.
Okay, you're not going to find what you're looking for here.
Sixteen years of being out there, I haven't found anything at all.
This guy, Mr. Mack can't help you find what you're looking for because you don't know what you're looking for, all right?
You're 16 years old.
That's what this guy does.
He makes you think you're lost so he can find you, and once he has you, he will never let you out of his sight, okay?
He will be there every time you turn around.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Hello.
Welcome to The Centre.
Okay, he's very powerful.
Who do I make the check out to?
You're here to see that your friend Shawn is making the right choice for himself, so check us out.
I think you're gonna like what you see.
Nobody judges who you are or where you come from.
Everyone here is the same.
Can I go in that room?
No.
That's the celebrity room.
Oh, that is the slickest guy I have ever seen.
So you see, Cory?
I'm not a prisoner here.
I can leave any time I want.
Okay, then I think we should go now.
I think we should leave right now.
Children of the Centre, let's welcome into our family our new life member, Shawn Hunter.
Good-bye.
You know, guys, I'm his best friend, and it's like he doesn't hear me anymore.
Okay.
Why does he have so much faith in this Centre?
All right, let's get in the car, go down, and drag him out ourselves.
I'm going with you.
I'm well-acquainted with The Centre.
I've been trying to close it down for some time now.
This Mr. Mack is a frightening man.
Hello, Mr. Feeny.
Cory.
Mr. And Mrs. Matthews.
Hello, Shawn.
Shawn, are you all right?
Of course I am.
I'm totally Centered.
Thanks, Eric, for bringing him back.
Actually, I brought Eric back.
Mr. Mack felt that Eric wasn't sincere, that he was just in it for the hugs.
Well, yeah.
Okay.
Everyone have a peaceful night.
I'm going back to The Centre.
Oh, no.
Whoa, whoa.
No, you're not.
While your parents are out of town, you are our responsibility.
That means you're staying here in this house.
Yeah.
Mr. Mack told me that people like you would try to talk me out of my beliefs.
Shawn, we love you.
He said you'd say that.
All right, fine.
That's enough.
Get him in the house and tie him up.
Shawn, these aren't beliefs.
This is just a way to escape a life that doesn't have beliefs.
That's a judgment.
You're damn right it is.
What's wrong with me trying to find something to believe in?
Look, Shawn, I'm all for your search for spirituality, okay?
But you don't seem to realize that Mr. Mack is conducting his own search for lost souls that he can influence and manipulate.
He said you'd say that.
Yes.
I'm sure he has given you a thought for every occasion.
Excuse me.
Look, Shawn, I don't say this very often, but Feeny's making sense.
Not to me.
I mean, why would Feeny feel the need to attack what I believe in?
Shawn, why do you need to believe in The Centre so strongly?
What?
Shawn, before you met these people at this place, what did you believe in?
I don't know.
Nothing.
Did you believe in God?
George, what is it?
Jonathan Turner.
He's been in a motorcycle accident.
Oh, no.
Is he okay?
Uh, no, he isn't.
Alan, would you give me a lift down to the hospital?
We'll all go.
Come on, Shawn.
I'll meet you guys there.
What do you mean?
I'll meet you guys there!
How's Mr. Turner?
The doctors are with him.
We're waiting to hear.
Where's Shawn?
I have no clue.
Well, Mr. Turner and Shawn are like brothers.
How could he not be here?
I don't know.
Shawn.
Mr. Mack.
Shawn thought I could be of some help.
Hello.
I'm Phillip Mack.
Feeny.
Mack, you don't belong here.
One of my children invited me, and as always, I'm here for him, as well as any other child who calls for me.
I want to come back.
No, no, no.
What is he doing here?
Cory, I couldn't face this alone.
Okay.
First of all, we're here.
Okay.
And second of all, I am beginning to see that you are more alone than I ever knew.
What does that mean?
I just want you to know that I forgive you for trying to shut us down.
You forgive me?
Whoa.
Easy, George.
Come on.
He's just trying to get a rise out of you.
Look, you're not dealing with gullible little kids here now, buddy.
Now, you brought Shawn down.
Thanks.
Why don't you just take a hike back to conland?
Now, do you see how judgmental these No, no.
Listen.
You see!
The judgment I made a long time ago is that Shawn Hunter is the best friend that my kid ever had, and I will kill to protect Shawn Hunter from people like you.
Alan, he would love a lawsuit.
I think there's a lot of anger here, and I don't feel that this is a healthy environment for Shawn.
Well, I really don't Look, I know you don't respect my philosophy.
But for kids who feel lost and have an emptiness in their lives, I'm here.
To give them a sense of belonging.
You can't have Shawn.
That's up to Shawn.
And in any event, there are many more just like him.
So come on, Shawn, let's go.
Shawn?
Cory, I can't be in here.
This is too intense.
For all of us, Shawn.
But this is life, and this is what's really happening right now.
I need Mr. Mack.
No.
He can't help you with this.
Shawn, what is the matter with you?
I don't know, but I can't look at him like this.
Cory, come on, let me go.
No.
Cory, let me go.
Shawn, this is a hug, okay?
This is a hug.
And this is when you hug somebody, when you care about them and that you want them to know that.
Now you cannot leave here.
Do you hear me?
Turner took care of you.
He loves you, and you love him.
Is that real?
Or are Mr. Mack and The Centre real?
You decide, but you cannot go.
We can go.
John, how could you be in here?
How could you screw-up on your bike?
I have never seen you screw-up on anything.
I'm the screw-up, remember?
Come on, you remember.
Don't do this to me, John.
I don't do alone real good.
Look, I know you're in there, but it's like you're not really here.
You're not talking, but I know you're here, so I'm just going to talk.
You can listen.
John, even when I was at The Centre, it was all the things that you taught me that made me wonder if it was the right place for me or not.
But you didn't teach me enough.
You and Cory and my parents and the Matthews and the handful of people who really care about me, so don't blow me off, John!
Don't blow me off, God!
I've never asked you for anything, and I never wanted to come to you like this, but don't take Turner away from me.
He's not done yelling at me yet.
God, you're not talking, but I know you're here, so I'm going to talk and you can listen.
God, I don't want to be empty inside anymore.
How is he?
He's going to be fine.
Really?
Is that what the doctor said?
No.
I just know he is.
Shawn, it's obviously been a very stressful day for you, and I think you should come back to The Centre.
Yeah, I think I should, too.
What?
I want to pick up my things, and then, if it's okay, come back and stay with you guys.
Yeah, it's okay.
Shawn You know, I see you right in front of me, and I hear what you have to say, and it's nothing.
And if I was an empty person who didn't have anything to believe in, I might go with you because that would be easy.
Well, I'm done with easy, and I'm done with empty.
I'm done with you.
Well We'll always be there for you, Shawn.
Yeah.
I know.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Eric, this college where you're going for an interview What, Beach State?
Yeah.
This is, like, a real college, right?
Uh, because we're looking over this letter you got from the admissions office, and there are an awful lot of typos in it.
Show me one.
"Yours truly, the Bean of Admissions.
" Yeah?
So?
Well, it's a very difficult school to get into.
They just don't let anybody in.
Oh, I am so psyched about this road trip.
Beach State's been recruiting me since kindergarten.
My dad's good friends with the bean.
Has anyone seen Topanga yet?
No, and she better hurry, man, because if we get there too late, the tide comes in, and then you can't park on campus.
You know something?
You're right.
Why don't you help me load the car.
Drop the umbrella, grab my boogie board.
Well, they're my ride.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You.
Back up.
We're okay with you going overnight with Topanga.
We just want to make sure we're clear on the sleeping arrangements.
Ah, interesting.
A little concern on the part of the parents.
You're worried Cory may get a little freaky this weekend?
Anything happens to Topanga, I'll kill you.
You like her better than me.
Eric, I think it's fine that you look at other colleges.
I just hope that you give serious consideration to Pennbrook.
Do you really think I'm Pennbrook material?
I mean, they've got that huge campus, all those 100-year-old buildings, all those smart people.
I mean, I'd get trounced there.
Well, it will be a challenge, but when you graduate, you'll have a degree that actually means something.
I don't know, Mr. Feeny.
I mean, right now, Beach State seems like a sure thing.
Yes, well, sometimes a sure thing is not the best thing.
But I know you'll do what's right.
Hey.
Okay, you're here.
Great, we can go.
All right, Topanga, all packed and ready to go Except you have no suitcase and no sleeping bag.
Why, Miss Topanga, I am flattered and more flattered.
Cory, I'm not going.
And less flattered.
My aunt wouldn't let me spend the night away unsupervised.
Unsupervised?
I'll be there.
That's kind of the problem.
She feels that, at our age, it might be improper.
Listen, Topanga, we are old enough to make these kind of decisions on our own, and now your aunt comes along and puts the kibosh on the whole deal.
I'm calling her, okay?
Cory?
What exactly did you think was going to happen this weekend?
Topanga, I don't know, I mean, there's a beach, there's a moon, there's you, there's me.
I'm sorry.
I can't go.
You know, I can't believe that you're going to let your aunt get in the way of us being together alone for a weekend.
Topanga, why doesn't this mean as much to you as it means to me?
That's not fair.
I don't think it's very fair, either, okay?
Where's she going?
Not with us.
Oh, cool, I can take my lounge chair.
Shh, shh.
Afternoon, Mrs. Blutemann.
Ja?
It is always good afternoon when there are no boys.
There are no boys?
Of course there are no boys.
This is a sorority house.
Ja, I am so sure.
Uh, not to be a snitch, but I think some of the pledges tracked in dirt again, and, I think they had boys.
Boy dirt?
Not on my watch.
Eric.
Oh!
Wow.
It's all coming true.
What is?
My fantasy, Cor.
I've had this exact dream, like, a million times.
Boy!
I'm just delivering a pizza.
Leave it on the stoop.
Oh!
Who was that?
The house mom.
She catches you, she'll boot me out of the sorority.
See, boys aren't allowed upstairs.
Especially, not in the bedrooms.
How did you know she was going to say that?
My dream.
It's exactly my dream.
I don't want to be in your dreams.
Uh, Julie, it's good to see you again.
Yeah, it's great to see you, too.
I appreciate you letting us stay here.
No, I do.
I also appreciate you letting our friends stay here.
You're not even going to know we're here.
Wow, your roommate's a pig.
Uh, that's my side.
Wow, you're the pig.
Don't sit there.
Mary Beth will have a cow.
My roomie's a total neat-freak.
She's cool with us staying here, though, right?
Mmm, probably not, but Mary's always at her boyfriend's place, anyway.
He's quarterback of the football team.
You know, this dream thing is getting eerie.
Hey, come on, what do you say we windsurf around the campus?
All right.
All right.
Hey, guys, uh, have fun.
Don't touch anything and stay away from me.
Cory, why so down in the mouth?
We're alone in a sorority, man.
All girls, all the time.
We are standing in the forbidden zone surrounded by women.
Yeah, right.
Surrounded by women, except for the one that should be here.
Oh, well, this is cute.
Hey, thanks.
Shawn Hunter, and you are Ignoring you.
Mrs. Blutemann!
No, no, no.
My brother's friends with your roommate.
Oh, well, that's different.
Boys!
Many boys!
No boys!
Uh, Mrs. Blutemann, they must've climbed out the window.
Why are you doing this to us?
We're invited guests.
And I love you.
Why are you still here?
You know, this may be my first time in a sorority house, but I'm detecting a little bit of an attitude.
You got a name?
Yeah Trouble.
All guys are trouble.
Why should you be any different?
She just broke up with her boyfriend, you know, the quarterback guy.
How does he know that?
I dreamed it, Miss Birthmark- on-her-tochus.
Shawn, Shawn, go easy on her, okay?
Listen, I'm sorry, okay?
With what you're going through, you probably don't need us to deal with, but, don't worry, we'll be out of your way very soon.
You're a sensitive guy.
Yeah, well, I wear a lot of light colors, so Uh, Shawn can I see you for a second?
Uh, listen, in this recurring dream, what happens next?
Uh, let's see.
I'm left alone with a beautiful sorority girl.
She just got dumped by her boyfriend.
She's not too fond of men at the moment, so she wreaks havoc on me, emotionally, and physically.
I see, and yet, there's only one detail that doesn't exactly mesh with your dream.
What's that?
The sorority girl's staring at me.
The rec room.
All right.
Well, let's see.
We've been water-skiing, snorkeling, played a little beach volleyball.
What do you say we take a break and see, like, where the learning goes on?
Well, we can check out the lab where Dr. Halberstram won the Nobel Prize for his cloning experiments.
Kidding!
Dr. Halberstram's a walrus.
Oh.
You know, there's got to be more to a school than just the beach.
Eric, where's the problem?
After all the hard work we put in at John Adams, this is our reward.
Yeah, but then what?
You know, I've been out in the real world for a year.
I know that to make it out there, you got to come out of this place with more than just a good tan.
What are you worried about?
The real world is, like, four years away.
Hey.
Yes.
Oh.
Oh, so you want your things back now?
That's fine.
Here are your CD's.
They'll be on the front lawn with your television set!
That was my sleeping bag.
Cory, we got to get out of here.
I think this woman is out of sorts.
In my dream, this is the part where she turns around, and the first guy she sees, she traps in her evil man-hating web of vengeful sexuality.
Get out.
Okay.
I want you to stay, because you're a sensitive guy, and I want to talk to you.
Well, okay, but maybe just for a minute.
He wants to dump me?
No great loss.
I never really meant anything to him, anyway.
He never really wanted to be with me, so Listen, I know that can make you feel bad, okay?
I mean My girlfriend was supposed to come with me this weekend and at the last minute, she bailed, you know?
I mean, I was really looking forward to spending time together, but I guess she wasn't.
Relationships.
Yeah, relationships.
You know, they're so complicated.
Hardly worth it.
I'm through with men.
Me, too.
So, you want to party?
You want to party or what?
Uh, Mary Beth, let us be absolutely clear of your definition of party, lest we should send out invitations and, I don't know, hire a clown.
Am I making you nervous, Cory?
Nervous?
No.
No, not if there's going to be a clown.
No clowns.
Just you and me.
Uh, and candles, huh?
You're, you're lighting candles.
Aromatherapy candles.
Here.
Smell.
Mmm.
Corn bread and pine needles.
Actually, it's ylang-ylang and sandalwood.
Sandalwood oil helps stimulate the mind and exalts calm and reflection.
And the ylang-ylang?
What does that stimulate?
I Oh, no.
Uh, listen, Mary Beth, I'm sorry, but I can't be here during this, the time of your great stimulation.
I'm stuck.
Uh, listen, Mary Beth, I am very flattered, but I do have a girlfriend, you know.
Her name is Topanga.
Topanga?
Sounds like a freeway exit.
What, you don't believe me?
Fine, I'll prove it to you, okay?
Hi, Miss Curtis?
Hi, it's me, Cory.
Is Topanga there?
Uh Uh, no, she can't call me back.
I'm on that trip.
You know, the one you wouldn't let her go on?
Uh, really?
Huh, that's weird.
No.
No message.
Bye.
Topanga lied to me.
She never even told her aunt about the trip.
Hey, that's mine.
Well, love is loss.
Sounds like she didn't want to come with you.
Yeah, I know.
I mean, she blamed it on her aunt, while the whole time it was me she didn't want to be alone with.
I'd be alone with you.
Listen, you just broke up with your boyfriend, okay?
I just got in a fight with my girlfriend.
We're both very vulnerable.
I don't want to do anything I'm going to regret.
Cory, sounds like you were counting on spending some time with a woman this weekend.
If you pass this up, you'll regret it.
And now the starting lineup for the At first, the big man, Cecil Fielder.
At second I won't tell anyone.
I'm going to go take a shower.
So that was it?
Not even close.
I'll be right back.
Don't you go anywhere.
Oh, well, that's just crazy.
Oh, boy.
Look at you.
You like the way I look?
Uh, yeah.
Uh, okay, stay there.
Don't come any closer.
Okay, one, two, three, red light.
See, now you're just going to lose the game.
No, we're both going to win.
Uh I can counter that move.
See, I'm on the wrestling team, so I'll just So am I. Sorry.
Uh I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were Have you seen my brother?
Present.
Okay, um Well, I'll just get a few things and be on my way.
Like you seem to be.
Uh, Eric, listen, this isn't what it looks like.
Oh, I know, you were just wrestling.
Uh, Mary Beth, my brother's here, okay?
That's okay.
Uh, not for me.
Could you maybe give us a minute or two?
Fine, um I'll go down and get my laundry, and then I'll be back.
I know what you're going to say.
No, Cory, you don't.
You're a big boy.
You know what you're doing.
Nothing was going to happen.
You don't have to answer to me, Cor.
Did you know Topanga lied to me?
Then she had this coming.
And Mary Beth is beautiful, and she's here, and no one's ever going to know about it.
Except for Mary Beth and you.
You know, Eric, we had this whole weekend planned out, okay?
Why didn't Topanga want to come with me?
And, tomorrow, Mary Beth will be gone, and so will 16 years of a great relationship with somebody you really care about, somebody you love, somebody who's worth waiting for.
Listen to me, Cory.
Throughout your life, there's going to be a lot of opportunities that come up.
And they're going to seem great, and they're going to seem wonderful, and they're going to seem like they make your life a heck of a lot easier, but you have to walk away.
And, you know, at times, it's going to be really difficult to do that, but you have to, because you deserve better.
But, hey, you know something?
It's your life, Cor.
It's your decision.
You know what's best for you.
Now, if you don't mind, got to meet Julie and her study group for jet skiing.
You know, Eric, you deserve better, too.
What do you mean?
Listen, if you go to this school, you're going to feel good for, like, a day, and then you won't.
Okay, I mean, I know you have worked so hard and so long.
You deserve to go to a place that's worthy of all that effort.
Okay?
You should go to Pennbrook.
The interview.
You blew the interview, huh?
I never went, Cor.
You know, I got scared.
It seemed hard, so, I left.
But this place, Cor, this is a sure thing.
How am I supposed to walk away from a sure thing?
So, what's it going to be?
I need to tell you something.
I love my girlfriend.
Like that.
Let's go.
Hey, lookie what I found.
I'm sorry, Eric.
Your interview was two days ago.
You didn't show up.
You didn't even notify us.
Now, if you'll excuse me, there are other applicants who were responsible enough to show up at their scheduled time.
I'm sorry.
I was scared.
I'm not here to listen to excuses.
It's not an excuse.
It's how I felt.
I mean, I'm still scared now, but not getting into college has determined who I am for too long, and I just want to make sure I go to the right school.
Well, what makes you think that this is the right school for you?
Look, I need Pennbrook, okay?
All my life I've heard about how much potential I have and what I'm capable of.
And I used to think it wasn't much, but now I do.
And I just want to make sure I go to the right school.
I want to see what my potential is.
I don't want to go to some school that won't test that.
I want to go here.
You had your chance, Eric.
No.
Pennbrook is my chance.
You're supposed to accept people that want to learn and study and grow, and if you don't then this school isn't living up to its potential.
And I want my interview.
Well, I think you just had it.
You lied to me.
You're right.
I did.
I was just worried about being alone with you overnight.
Then you should've told me that, okay?
If you didn't trust me, Topanga, you should've told me.
And you can also tell me When did you ever say no to me that I didn't listen?
When did you ever worry about being alone with me?
Never, Cory.
I was worried about me.
I was worried about what I might do alone with you and the beach and the moon.
I know I'm not ready yet.
Listen, I know things are going to happen between us when they're supposed to happen.
And I know I'll wait until they do.
Yeah?
How do you know?
Well, I just know that the best things in life are worth waiting for.
Yeah.
I feel that same way about you, Cory.
Yeah?
Mmm.
Sure.
You know, you're a very sexy boy, Cory.
Really?
I'm a sexy boy?
Thanks.
Can't wait to tell Shawn.
Well, here it is.
My letter from Pennbrook.
I can't, I can't.
Here, you do it.
Okay, okay, okay.
Open it.
This is it.
Open it.
All right.
Come on!
All right, all right, all right.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy, this is bad.
What?
What, what, what?
Now, Eric, that Dean Bolander is a tough cookie.
How do you know her?
She's been after me for years.
Ooh, this just keeps getting worse.
Just tell me!
Okay, okay.
First of all, they're charging an arm and a leg.
And they want you there, like, a week before Labor Day for some kind of orientation deal.
I'm in?
I'm in!
I'm in!
Yeah!
Knew you could do it.
Congratulations, Eric.
Job well done.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Oh, thank you for everything.
Well, it's what I do.
