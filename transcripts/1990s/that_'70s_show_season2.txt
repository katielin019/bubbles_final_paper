Hey uh dad, Donna and I were gonna go see the Goodbye Girl Yeah, well I am sure its a great movie Eric but your gonna be helping with the garage sale, it's important Oh right were having the garage sale because you lost your job, I mean because of all the clutter.
Everybody needs to work Eric the gravy train has made its last stop Okay there was a gravy train?
Yup and you missed it.
Oh Steven I have a great idea you could sell lemonade Mrs. Forman Ive thrown a lot of rocks at kids with lemonade stands Lord knows I hate a hypocrite You could have a little bake sale I pretty much beat any kid selling anything Steven you could just do a little table with some cookies and some brownies I am not much of brownies?
I could make brownies because people love brownies No they dont Oh they love my brownies Oh Steven you are such a joy to have around the house I cant believe your mother abandoned you, I mean went on such a long trip Boy I sure do like brownies, Hey you know whats got two thumbs and really likes brownies?
This guy Hyde, oh come on I am asking you not to make these brownies, I mean my mom and dad are way too fat Nice cover You know what Eric you just leave him alone this is Stevenss contribution to our garage sale and I happen to know that you put the special ingredient in these brownies.
I told him not too  Special ingredient?
Yes, love Oh yeah theres a whole big bag of love in there Mom, crazy Helen from across the street is switching price tags and dad says hes gonna kick her in the keester Oh no hell do it too Hey Kelso Oh look it's chocolate batter I sure do wish I could finish all this chocolate batter on my finger but I just cant, guess I can bye Man I was so close Hyde, God you cant make special brownies in my parents kitchen Oh no I already made 'em if only you had warned me sooner Come man Im serious Look Forman relax man okay Yeah I am making special brownies but I am also making regular brownies for the straight folks or losers Yeah, someday in gonna own a restaurant and everything is gonna be special and then when people ask me and they say hey Kelso whats the special Im gonna say everything!
I cant believe youd rather stay here than go see a movie with me Oh believe me Donna I'd love to go but Red said I can't and well he can kick my ass so Eric I can kick your ass - Oh yeah - hmm Lets go Lets go, come on bring it on Man, what are you doing?

Kitty, I noticed youre selling the kissing dolphins Bob and I bought you.
You know what is that doing on this table?
Red I told you not to sell that, give it to me Ill just Ill run it right back into the house.
Oh and Red your also selling that pocket fisherman we gave you for Christmas.
Dont you wanna run that back into the house too?
No Bob that was a really dumb gift.
Okay so the Goodbye Girl starts at two so Id better go.
Well I guess this is goodbye, girl.
Fez youre so funny   Well hello Jackie   Did you see that Fez?
Yes you did, she may be taking my popcorn but she knows there is more in my lap than that.
She wants you old boy nows your chance be smooth, think Ricardo Montelbone just turn, lock eyes and go,  Wait, wait Fez what are you doing?
Oh my god  youre a dead man  Could I have avoided this?
Lets review, first Jackie said I was funny next she ate popcorn from my groin, then I sucked her face Nope, it was meant to be.
Forman this doesnt make any sense, I am out of brownies but I should have more money Hyde thats dirty money theres never enough No man its like I lost an entire tray of brownies Wait what kind of brownies did you lose Hyde were they regular brownies?
They were special brownies Where was the last place you had them In the oven In my mothers oven ?
Oh now see Steven your brownies they were a big hit!
You know, I am glad the plant is closing it frees me up to do my own thing You said do my own thing Oh Red your own thing thats so hip I love salt I like that word hip it kinda pops you know, hip, hip, hip I can see my own mouth You know whats beautiful, Fruitcake.
All the different colored fruits living together in one cake.
I jumped out of a cake once I also like sweet but theres just something about salt Hip, it starts to lose its meaning after a while you know.
Hip, its not even a word Oh my god, listen you can hear my heart, Oh my god there it is again No that someone at the door Maybe its the cops Its just someone for the garage sale.
Take whatever you want it wont fill the hole in your life.
Well Ill see who it is You know for a terrible grouch Red Is great in bed Im sorry what?
Hip pity Hop pity Easter's on its way Where did you go Red?

You sold Erics car?
Oh no  Dad you sold my car?
How could you?
Just what in the hell were you thinking?
I thought I was helping because youre always saying how you need money.
For gas, for the car Dont yell at him, but to be honest Red were a little disappointed Im not gonna run anymore errands for you pal You should have checked with us first Red You know how many times I rotated those tires?
Youre not supposed to take things that arent yours I had stuff in the back seat, now thats all just gone mister Forman its okay No its not okay Look Red who did you sell the car too?

In a way I dont blame Fez I am very appealing.
I just cant believe he kissed you thats  Donna I have to confess something, it wasnt terrible How not terrible?
It was the best kiss of my life, I mean Fez is totally not an option cause hes foreign and everything but Michael has never kissed me like that.
What was so good about it?

Well, thanks, sweetie!
Good luck, honey.
Bye, daddy.

Ohmmmm!
Oh, good god.
What are you guys doing, now?
Yoga.
Im trying to align your fathers shockers.
I didnt even know the damn things were out of whack!
Why cant you guys be normal?
Donna, your negativity is bruising our auras!
Please leave.
Gladly!
Oh, and honey, were also exploring tantric sex, so if you hear any strange noises coming from mommy and daddys bedroom Eeeew!
Why must you guys freak me out on a daily basis?
I dont wanna picture you naked.
And Im leaving now.
Forever.
Ohmmm!
Ouch.
Ok, Donna.

Thank you, Eric!
Oh, you want dirty bad fun?
Listen to this.
I came here fully clothed  Oh!

I know!
There, theres this new club that opened in Chicago.
Its supposed to be like, like, the hottest spot this side of Studio 54.
My god, you guys, thats perfect!
No, no, no, Michael, we cant go.
My parents are gonna be out late tonight, and we have to study.
Study?
No, what a gyp!
Im going to the club.
No!
No, no, Michael, youre coming over to my house tonight.
And were gonna  study.
Fine!
God.

Hi.
Red Forman.
Experienced, loyal, hardworking.
Yeah.
Everyone: Hey!
Its all you guys from the plant, huh?
So!
Were all going after the same job.
Well!
Thats uh thats terrific!
Well, I wish I had your confidence, Red.
I got nothing.
All I could think to do was tell this guy Im experienced, loyal, and hardworking.
Red:  Son of a bitch.
So I brought my books.
Michael, were not gonna study.
Were not?
No.
My parents are gonna be gone for hours.
So what do you wanna do?
Oh!
Check it out.
Bowie.
Man, hes cool.
Yeah.
Androgynous guys are so manly!
Michael?
Do you know who would look totally, totally sexy glammed up like Bowie?
Who?
You, Michael!
Youre crazy!
No, Im not glam!
No, no, come on, Michael!
You have such pretty eyes!

Ok.
Here.
Take a look.
Ok, yeah, my eyes are gorgeous.
See!
See, I told you!
Michael, do you know what you need now?
Some blush!
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, Jackie.
All right, glam is one thing, but I think were crossing over into weird.
No, no, trust me, Michael, were not.
With cheek bones like that?
Blush is your best friend!
Yeah, I do have bitchin cheek bones.
Ok, lets blush!
People are so friendly around here!
Two women on the corner just offered to have sex with me!
Yeah, for money, Fez.
I could not ask them for money!
Or could I?
Wow, guys, check out this crowd!
I know!
This is gonna be so great.
Lets go see how long the wait is.
Scuse me, how long  Youre in!
Oh, man, Im so up with that!
Not you.
Well, thats fine, Ill just wait with you guys.
No, were next.
Go in!
Yeah?
All right, Ill see you guys inside!
You know what?
This is probably just some kind of fire code thing.
Yeah, ok, wait, whats going on?
Were next!
No, youre not.
What are you talking about?
Well, Archie, Im here to let the cool people in, and keep the geeks out.
Those poor stupid geeks!
Oh my god, we are geeks!
Hey!
Did slipping the bouncer a ten work?
Yes, it did, Hyde.
Thats why Im inside the club.
There you are!
This place is awesome!
Why arent you inside?
Oh, we were in.
Uh, we were on the inside.
I didnt see you.
Oh, yeah, we waved at you.
But you were, uh  - Dancing.
- Excellent!
Uh, you were dancing.
And then we went through this  - Door.
- Yes!
We went through this door.
And, we were locked out, uh, and then we had to get in the back of the line!
So  All right, well, when you get back inside, find me!
Go!
Yeah!
Hyde, Fez and Eric: Yeah, go, yeah!
Well see you on the inside!
- Ok That was really smooth.
Smooth enough to get us in?
No.
Okay, that's it!
You must let me in!
Why?
Because I feel the hot rhythm of disco burning in my loins.
Watch.
Ok, youre in.
So long, losers!
Youre saying that, that this stuff wont come off?
Like, even if I cry?
Man, thats great!
Oh, Michael, youre the best doll I have ever had!
You know what?
I have the perfect gown for you.
All right, Jackie, slow down.
Ok, wearing lipstick is one thing, but a gown?
Thats kinda fruity.
No, no its not, Michael!
Bowie wears dresses!
Joe Nemeth wears panty hose!
Jackie, no!
Ill be right back.
Jackie, I said no!
All right.
Nothing too girlie, and I mean it!
Well, so much for your he-cant-stop-both-of-us theory.
This bites, man.
He cant keep us outta there.
I mean, what, did we wake up in Russia this morning?
No.
We did not, in fact, wake up in Russia this morning.
I didnt think so.
Hey, lemme tell you something, pal!
Youre propping up a dying system, man!
Cause, see, someday soon, people are gonna wake up, and theyre gonna realize that most of us dont fit into your Hollywood, Madison Avenue, candy coated ideal of whats cool.
And when we do, were gonna rise up!
Were gonna put you on a trial!
Then prance through the street with your head on a stick!
Righteous political outrage.
Youre in.
All right!
Ill see you later, Forman.
Yeah, well when the revolution comes, man  youre backs gonna be up against the wall  damn it!
Let me in!
My girlfriends in there!
The foxy redhead?
Thought that was your sister!
What does she see in you?
You know what she sees?
Buddy, you know what she sees?
Well, let me tell you something, if she was the bouncer, Id be in that stupid club right now, you big ass!
Yeah!
I said it.
Hi honey.
Uh-oh!
I didnt get the job.
Ok, well, you will get them next time.
Ah, Kitty.
The worlds changing.
Things arent turning out the way I expected.
Well, Red, what did you expect?
Well, I dont know  Take that, Hirohito!
And that!
Yes, with Americas victory overseas now complete, our fighting boys return home, where the American working man takes his rightful place on the throne.
Hi honey!
How was your day?
They gave me another raise.
Oh, honey.
With all the money you make, its no wonder I dont have to work.
Daughter Laurie has a question.
Daddy, why is the American economy the envy of the world?
"Well, " Says Dad.
Its because the American worker is experienced, loyal, and hardworking.
Looks like Junior has some good news.
Say, dad.
You can stop giving me money now.
I just got a football scholarship to Notre Dame!
I guess experience, loyalty, and hard work, really do pay off!
Daughter Laurie has another question.
Daddy, can you tell me why Germany and Japans economies never recovered?
Its simple.
They are not experienced.
They are not hard working.
They are not loyal.
And they do not speak English.
Speaking of work, mom has to go grocery shopping.
Can I have the keys to the Cadillac?
Ha ha!
Forget the Cadillac!
Take the hovercraft!
Red?
The hovercraft?
Hovercraft?
What?
They promised us hovercrafts.
Just another damn broken promise.
Ok!
Cream, two sugars!
Well, you just drink up, and Ill just  I dont know, head inside.
Yeah.
No.
Oh, come on!
You suck!
Mr. Big-shot bouncer!
Mr. I-open-and-close-the-rope.
Mr. Boat on the River Styx!
Just, god!
I bet youve never been excluded from anything in your whole life!
Hey!
Thats not fair, Ive been excluded from lots of things.
Yeah, like what?
Oh no, ok, uh, when I was in kindergarten, we used to play Duck, Duck, Goose, and nobody ever picked me to be the goose.
Oh, wow, that mustve really hurt.
I didnt care.
You didnt care.
Uh-huh.
So youre just sitting there, watching this kid go around the circle, duck, duck, duck, hed get closer and closer, duck, youd be shaking with anticipation, duck, maybe hell pick me, duck, maybe Ill get to run and laugh with the joy of being a goose, and then hed come to you, place his hand on your head and say duck and youre telling me you didnt care?
Uh, yeah, it hurts.
Yes!
It-thank you!
Thats what Im saying!
And now you have made me the duck!
Wow oh man, I didnt realize  Dance goose.
Dance!
Oh god, Michael, in that dress, you are way prettier than Bowie!
Hell, Im prettier than you!
Thats not funny, Michael.
Did you just hear a car pull up?
Relax, Jackie.
Your parents arent supposed to be home for like, another hour.
Spin me.
Hi, daddy.
Were studying!
No, no, no, daddy, no, daddy, I love him!
Wow, what a night, right?
Oh, exactly!
Donna, why are you with me?
Um, the bouncer wanted to know.
Whatd you tell him?
You know, I couldnt think of a reason.
Hm.
You know, come to think of it, I cant either!
What I need to do is find a guy whos like, totally different from you.
Maybe big, and dumb, and you know, not nice to me.
Oh, and, no sense of humor so when I tell a joke he doesnt get it.
I mean, thats a real turn on.
- Ok, ok.
- No!
No, no, no, seriously!
Thank you.
I mean, if you hadnt pointed this out to me I mightve wasted years with you.
I mean, I almost had sex with you!
Whoo!
Thank you!
Ok, I think the question has become why am I with you?
Oh, right!
Ok.
I had a great time.
Goodnight.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
So, look at us.
This is just like a Norman Rockwell painting.
Mom is serving breakfast, daddy is reading the newspaper and brother Eric is trying to hide a big purple nasty hickey!
Hickey?
I don't have a hickey You know Eric, hickeys lead to dirty things For God 's sakes, don't let Donna suck your neck.
She's a nice girl.
I don't have a hickey!
I was using a curling iron.
Oh well, will you just look at that?
NO!
Mom!
Red, remember that time.
No and neither do you!
Okay!
Hahaha.
So, uhm Laurie, what's on the agenda today?
Agenda?
A list of goals or actions one might feel good about achieving so as to Eric, you tell her.
Mom, come on, relax, I'm still getting used to being back home.
Yea, flunkin' out of college can be draining *phew* Eric!
Come on, that was so mild!
Laurie all you do is sit around the house and watch television you should come down to the hospital and volunteer.
She's right Laurie!
Daddy !
You know, I think Eric needs an agenda.
Look at his neck!
It's a birthmark!
It's been there since birth!
Goodmorning class.
Good morning, orphan.
Goodmorning That's all you got?
Whore!
Mom, he called me a whore!
Yeah.
Stephen, honey, you're too young for coffee, have some juice.
Mrs. Foreman, I need coffee.
Your son kept me up all night bragging about his hickey.
Okay, whatever you do Eric, do NOT wear turtlenecks to school okay, that's a dead giveaway.
Yea, I'd put on a decorative scarf.
Thank you.
Do you have to tell everyone about the hickey?
Well, everyone can kinda see it, Vampirette.
Laurie had a field day at breakfast.
Yeah, I hopped on that dog pile too.
You sure did, you dillhole.
All right Foreman, that was sort of mean.
Probably what I should have said is: I'm sick of sharing a room with you and all of your disgusting fluids and gasses.
Oh, and yours are just dreamy Hyde.
Excuse me.
May I please have a hickey please?
- No.
- Please?
- No!
- Jackie ?
- No!
- Please ?
No!
So, the two of you do things to please your man.
Well Fez is a man, why do you not please him?
Why?
Why ?
Jackie!
Just give him a hickey.
Okay.
I'm going home.
Me too.
I've gotta go shopping with my mom, suddenly it's like really important we're being best friends.
What happened?
She's been reading.
Reading Dammit, when will they learn?
Finally!
I thought that Jackie would never leave!
Okay Kelso, what are you doing?
Ah, I need a sexy memento from Laurie.
I gotta commemorate our forbidden love.
With panties!
Fine!
Just take your panties and go home.
Man!
Those are my moms!
Okay Foreman look man, I'm not telling you how to live your life, but if someone touched MY moms panties, pf Hyde, didn't everyone touch your moms panties?
Man, that was a burn!
Okay, Foreman, I have a solution to this whole you-being-a-pain-in-my-ass-we-shareing-a-room-thing.
You move out.
- Of my room?
- Yea.
Well that's just not gonna happen.
Hey fine, I move out of it, you big baby.
Still friends?
I need time to heal.
Okay, these are Laurie's right?
Kelso, what exactly are you gonna do with those panties?
Just.
look at 'm Kelso, did you ever notice that Laurie and Eric have the same eyes?
So if you're doing it with Laurie and she's perhaps wearing a hat it's kinda like you're doing it with Eric too!
So.
Here we are.
Together.
Again.
Yea, I'm just loving the time we spend together Donna.
In my new book 'Our Mothers, Our Selves' it says we're supposed to be friends.
We should talk to each other, and listen.
You're stupid father never listens.
Is there anything in your book about not insulting my father?
Well I don't know, I've only read the first chapter.
Oh, okay, no more talking about your father.
So, how do you like the clogs I bought you?
They're awesome!
Good!
Cause your father's an ass !
Kelso took your underwear.
- Uhh that's like the third pair!
- Urgh.
Gimme the remote control!
Gimme a reason why I shouldn't set you on fire!
All right Laurie, take your best shot!
Oh Red, we talked about this, let him go!
Hello Laurie, I apologize for coming unannounced, but I .
Mum, daddy !
This is professor Stark, he was my art history teacher!
Well actually I was your psychology teacher.
Whatever you taught her, she flunked it!
Eric!
So, you're from the university of Wisconsin.
Are you here to give me back my money?
Well actually I came here because of Laurie Oh yes, he came to see if the university would take me back!
Really?
Oh please, here, have a seat!
I'll make coffee, and cake, I'll make coffeecake and coffee!
Hahaha!
Oh gosh really, can you get her back into the university and out of my house?
Hahaha Well, I'm going to try my darndest!
Well this is really good news!
One of the best things I've ever heard.
Yes it is.
I want to get Laurie back in school.
Professor, question, how lame exactly is your student body if you're trying to get this dumb cow ba.
Eric !
Don't be a smarthmouth, we've got.company.
Yea, go make coffee.
Don't scare him off, he's our only hope!
So uhm, maybe you could stay for dinner Well yes thank you, that would be lovely.
Oh, and I believe these paint chips are yours.
Well, these are, are the colour of our front door, aren't they?
Yeah, you had a paint chip hanging from your front door so I ..
I started to peel it and I guess I got a little over zealouse Uhmmm psychology huh?
Yes yes, human ?
?
fascinate me Hey dad.
Where have you two been?
Mom bought me these clogs aren't they great?
Oh.
She bought you clogs.
With my money.
So officially, I bought you clogs.
No Bob, I bought her the clogs.
Get in the car Donna!
I'm gonna buy you something.
Actually Dad, I've got homework and.
Do you love your daddy?
Yes.
Let's go.
Looks like you're going shopping with the big ASS.
I don't think so.
Eric I need you to go to the store and get me three pounds of ground beef, lean Mom, look, before you go into twenty cents a gram ground beef, this guy is not going to get Laurie back in college, shes stupid and evil.
Mostly stupid.
Eric she is not stupid.
Shes just she has .
special .
Just go!
Hyde!
Oh, honey, just share the room with Eric.
No, thank you.
I'm fine.
Busted!
No way!
Yep, Laurie and her professor, tongueing in the garage like hungry dogs.
It was really disgusting.
No!
No, you see because Laurie wouldnt just make out with some old guy.
She wouldnt do that.
No, its true man.
I was in the upstairs closet trying out my cot, and I saw them.
It was like live porno.
But not good porno which is like really really old.
It was like, old bad porno.
Michael, why do you care if Laurie kisses the professor?
Yea Kelso, why do you care?
Well .
because.
You see its wrong for an old person to make out with an innocent young student.
God, youre nobel.
Innocent?
!
Okay, Eric no offence, but your sister is as slutty as they come.
Eric are you gonna let her say that about your sister?
Sure.
Hey, Forman, did you realise that theres a room back here man?
And it barely stinks!
PERFECT!
You can sit right back beneath your bare bulb writing angry letters to the government Oh dont think I wont !
You see whats beautiful here people?
I finally have somtehing on Laurie.
I own her, oh yeah!
She is so screwed!
All right, just be nice.
Look!
Did everyone see my hickey?
Somebody loves me.
Moron, you gave that to yourself.
Its still wet.
Oh no I did not!
Somebody loves me.
There is a lady love.
There is !
So, you like the shirt I bought ya?
Its very nice I wasnt sure because you didnt put it on in the store, like you did with the clogs.
I knew it.
You hate the shirt!
Nice digs huh!
Its perfect.
This is where we put all our old crap we just cant throw away.
Like you.
Forman, is it just me, or do your mum and dad like me a whole lot better then they like you?
You see I kid, butyou hurt Boys!
Dinner!
All right man, you ready to make Laurie sqeal like the family pig?
Ohhhhh.
Yes.
You're gonna punk out, aren't you?
Well it is my nature.
Look Forman, you've always been the run for the litter.
This is your chance to bite the big dog on the ass.
So my advice to you is, bite the big dog on the ass!
Okay, what if I let her of with a warning, you know, just this one time.
Well that would be the mature choice But not EVIL!
You gotta think EVIL man!
Where would we be without the A-bomb?
- Actually the world was all that won but - Shut up!
Now listen, lets review.
Daddy, Eric has dirty magazines under his bed.
Daddy, Eric snuck out last night.
Daddy, I saw Eric drinking all your beer.
Daddy, Eric made it hard for me to concentrate so I flunked out of college.
Daddy, Eric used all my handlotion Okay that bitch is dead!
So, this news of Laurie leaving is just a little ray of sunshine!
Hahaha!
Well I just wished that more teachers cared about their students like you do.
I think it all started going downhill when you couldn't paddle the kids anymore.
Hehehe.
Pansy-ass supreme court.
Shut up.
Hey Forman, he who hesitates is boned.
Laurie is one of the most gifted women in my class.
I've always enjoyed having her.
I own you.
Is there something wrong with the bread?
No.
Why?
O, Laurie.
I know something that you don't know that I know.
You know.
Yes yes.
Tell us Forman, so that we can all know.
You don't know anything.
And if you do know something, I will make you sorry you were ever born!
Well for your information, I'm already sorry I was ever born!
Eric!
See!
So, what does she need to do to get back into school?
Well, she'll have to work with me.
Make a commitment..
to school.
She'll really have to buckle down.
Hahahaha!
Well what do you think Laurie, are you willing to give it a go?
Oh, huhuh, mother she's very willing.
You know dad, I just saw the most interesting thing today.
In the garage.
Burst into flames, burst into flames, BURST INTO FLAMES!
It was justit was so surprising.
Oh Eric, do tell!
I saw Laurie.
I'm love with your daughter!
Dad!
That's it!
Come here!
!
Did you two have fun?
A blast.
Donna, that shirt your father bought you makes you look so fat.
Yeah well, those clogs make you look like a duck.
Okay, you know what?
Both you guys really need to shut up.
I'm so sick of hearing you fight.
Do you even know what you are fighting about?
Oh, I know she started it!
I only got mad cause I knew you were gonna get mad.
Allright okay, you know what WHATEVER, just no more fighting with eachother through me.
Got it?
Although I would like you to continue buying me things, I mean, thank you!
She likes the shirt better You're an ass Bob!
Oeh, good comeback!
Mister Forman, I really wanna get Laurie back in school!
Oh for Gods sake Laurie, the man is in love with you and you still couldn't pass!
So ?
So I guess I disappointed you Daddy I'm really sorry, I just wish he wouldn't have taken advantage of me and my love for education.
Huh that is just so ?
?
?
Well, I guess you're not the first student to be taken advantage of by a teacher.
O, wait, where are you going Dad?
Just try not to be too hard on yourself.
No!
Nooo!
NOOOO!
And the really sad thing is, Eric saw him kiss me today.
And he didn't even TRY to stop him!
Cause she wanted it!
You knew about this and you didn't do anything?
!
She's your sister!
Yea Eric, why?
!
I'll deal with you later Eric!
Come on Laurie, I'll make you a cup of coffee and explain to you the nature of men.
Something I thought you already knew but apparantly you don't.
Oh, Eric, I forgive you.
Well this is unforgivable.
In fact you SUCK!
I'll be in my room Oh, mom.
Oh, my God, mom I had her in my sights!
I mean she was right in the cross there!
O honey, you know I love you and your sister equally, but if you ever get an opportunity again, for Gods sake pull the trigger!
I'm gonna tell you something Laurie.
If you slept with that professor, it's over between you and me.
Kelso, I slept with him a thousand times.
Why must you hurt me ?
Shut up!
Hey, hey, get out, get out!
I hate you both!
Go home, Fez!
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
A UNICEF contribution of thirteen cents will feed a child for a month.
Man, living in Africa must be great!
Everythings so cheap.
If you ask me, man, UNICEFs a scam.
If we ask you, everythings a scam.
Everything is a scam.
Oh, lighten up.
Remember how much fun Halloween used to be?
Making costumes, Trick-or-Treating  What is Trick-or-Treating?
Well, you put on a costume, you go door to door and say, trick-or-treat!
And people give you candy.
Oh, you got to be kidding me!
They just give you candy?
The best part of Halloween is getting the crap scared out of you.
One year, I saw The Legend of Sleepy Hollow; I couldnt sleep for, like, a month!
They give you candy?
Just like that, no strings?
Yes, Fez, get over it!
Hey, you guys, you know what?
My church is doing a haunted house.
I really dont think anyones gonna be scared by a bunch of Episcopalians.
Unless they have chainsaws!
Lets go see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!
Michael, I told you!
I dont like Texans!
I know!
Uh, we can go to Old Maine.
Our old grammar school?
Yeah, sure, you know, a dark, burnt out, boarded up school, very creepy?
We could, you know, we could tell ghost stories.
Free candy?
Even if youre not from this country?
Yes!
Hey, whyd they burn down the school, anyway?
Oh, they said it was arson.
What?
I was out of town that week.
Hm.
How convenient.
So youre telling me  that if I showed up at someones house and say trick-or-treat, theyll give me a free piece of candy?
YES!
Oh, I dont believe you.
Trick-or-treat!
An apple?
Wheres my candy, you son of a bitch?
Oh, shes very good.
I like her.
I hope she lives.
Huh.
Oh well.
Why doesnt anyone just shoot him?
I mean its Texas; everyone has a gun.
Yeah, yeah.
This movies so lame.
Man, she deserved it.
She had sex.
And like all movie sluts before her, she must die.
No!
She was about to take her shirt off!
Trick-or-treat!
Ok, here you go.
Mmm!
Raisins!
Eeew!
No, raisins are good for you!
Raisins are natures candy!
And eggs are natures hand grenade.
Kitty, dont give em raisins!
It just pisses em off!
Jeez.
I hate Halloween!
Well, you used to love Halloween!
Remember that party we had when we first moved in here?
Oh.
Mother Forman.
I see that you let yourself in again!
Boy!
Thats an awful lot of food!
I cant imagine that you have that many friends, Kitty.
Oh.
Well, speaking of friends, how are your four cats?
Hey, Frank, uh, pull my finger!
No way.
You were killing me in the car, man!
Oh, good, youre home!
Hey, Kitty!
I like your outfit.
Youre a kitty!
Yes, I am, Frank.
And what are you?
Bum.
Im a bum!
And I knew that!
Red, honey, um  I-I could, I could use some help here.
Uh, gee, Kitty, Id really like to help you out, but, uh, we gotta take these out to the garage and get plowed!
He is such a good boy!
Hello?
Oh, hi, Dr. Ferrell  Hm.
Really?
Oh my god!
Oh!
Thank you!
Thank you, doctor!
Yeah, thank you!
Wrong number.
Oh, god.
No!
Youre pregnant!
Yes, I am.
Do you know who the father is?
You know what I hear is nice?
Florida!
Look at this dump!
No wonder Hyde tried to burn it down!
You know, Fez, a man died in that fire.
A gym teacher.
Coach Smith.
Some say his specter still roams the halls to this day.
Take a laaaaap!
Give me twenty, walk it oooooff!
All right, guys, lets just cut it out, ok?
Youre scaring the women!
OUT OF MY WAY!
!
Kelso, it was the window!
Yeah!
I know that.
Out of my way?
No, I didnt say that!
Yes you did, right before you knocked her over.
No!
I, I was protecting you!
Protecting me?
Yeah!
I was trying to draw the ghost away from you.
Ghosts are attracted to movement, and thats a scientific fact!
You know what, I dont care!
You are an idiot and science is stupid!
Donna, lets go.
Gee, wonder what were gonna talk about.
Youre dooooomed!
God, I cant believe Michael pushed me out of the way like that!
Me neither!
I figured hed use you as a human shield!
Donna, the most noble thing a man can do is lay down his life for the woman he loves.
Ideally, while shes still young and can remarry!
Do you know who protected me there?
Fez.
Well, he had to; hes Batman.
And the man said, "Here's your daughter's sweater.
She left it in mycar, last night".
And the woman said, "Why, that's impossible.
My daughter died ten years ago.
Wearing thatverysweater".
So?
So, she was dead.
And he gave her a ride.
And she was dead!
When I was six, the mayor of our town was hung from a tree.
Your story was not scary.
Not scary?
The ghost of a dead girl gave him her sweater!
What does a ghost need with a sweater, man?
Maybe its to keep her guts from falling out.
You can tell it was not scary because Michael-ina here did not run screaming for the door!
Hey.
Wheres it written that a guy has to protect his girl?
Huh?
And Ill have you now that the feminine form of my name is Michelle.
Look, Michelle.
I dont wanna come out in favor of saving Jackie, but thats the price you pay for docking your love boat in Jackie-vyarta.
Ok.
So, Icabod Crane lived in the village of Sleepy Hollow.
Wait, dont tell me.
He left his jacket somewhere!
Ok, thats it.
Halloweens over.
Theres just, theres nothing that scares us anymore.
Hey, guys.
We found something scary.
Yeah, it was in the principals office.
Oh my god, those look like like  They are.
Our permanent records.
Wow.
Our permanent records!
Oh, you know what?
They probably left these here after the school burned down.
Hey!
Pinciotti, Donna.
Well!
Looks like someone we know had a real hard time keeping her clothes on in kindergarten!
What?
That was just a stupid phase.
Sure glad thats over.
I fear that despite Stevens high IQ, hes a born trouble maker and is destined to be the smartest man!
In his cellblock!
What?
They couldnt have known that in second grade.
Steven willfully and maliciously destroyed Christine DelBuenos shoebox diorama of the four food groups.
Youre a monster.
A horrible, horrible monster.
Yeah, real funny, but I didnt do it.
You know whats really funny, Hyde?
What, Forman?
Heh heh.
I broke the diorama.
You?
Hers was better than mine.
I had to smash it.
I left out dairy.
You know, thats when everybody turned against me.
They pegged me as a bad kid.
And once that happens, youre labeled forever.
You ruined my life, Forman!
No, he didnt!
Hyde, no offense, but with an alcoholic mom and an absent dad, you were bound to end up in jail sooner or later.
Hyde, I said no offense.
Yeah, right, lets see what that file says about you, Jackie.
Go ahead, I have a perfect record.
Would anybody like to know what Jackies middle name is?
- Jackies middle name is  - No!
Oh, I hate you!
Its Buela!
Trick-or-treat!
Oh, you look so cute in your little costumes!
Damn, Frank, thats funny!
Look, he lost his candy!
Oh, that was not funny, Red.
Those were just little kids.
Well, thats what makes it funny!
Well, think about it, honey, would it be funny if it were your own kids?
But I dont have kids.
Well, you might!
What are you saying?
Im saying Im pregnant!
Oh, no!
No!
I mean, uh oh, crap.
Yeah.
All right, nobody move!
Somebody took my last box of Sugar Babies!
Oh, no, wait!
I was sitting on them!
Gee, Fez.
You didnt give Forman a chance to pin it on me.
I didnt pin anything on you!
No?
Well, when Mrs. Hodgekis was yelling at me in front of the whole class, you didnt exactly step up and take responsibility.
What were you thinking?
Hm, I guess I was thinking, Im seven!
Hey, hey, hey!
Lets not fight, all right!
Its Halloween, man!
Its time for peace on earth and good will towards men!
Lets read another file.
Yeah, cause thats working out great so far.
All right, fine!
Ill read from my own, okay?
Oh, okay.
Heres a secret you guys dont know about me cause it happened the year before I moved here.
When I was in first grade I used to wear this red cape to school and pretend I was Superman.
Mustve looked really stupid.
Wait, w-wait, first grade?
Yeah.
No, no, no, when you moved here you and I were in first grade, thats how we met.
No, we didnt.
Man, you had to repeat first grade?
Oh my god!
Michael, say its not true!
It was, it was cursive writing, all right?
All those stupid squiggles and bumps!
I wouldnt do it!
You mean you couldnt do it.
No, I wouldnt do it, and thats why they held me back!
Plus, I mightve killed the class bunny.
WHY?
?
Its ok, Kelso, let it out.
It sucked, you know.
Living this lie, pretending to be a year younger than I really am.
Wait a minute.
Youre eighteen?
Yeah.
I mean, thats why Ive always seemed more mature than you guys.
Are you telling me that all this time you couldve been buying us beer?
You bastard!
What-no!
No, its not what you think!
Youre dead to me.
But Eric ruined your life!
And if I had a beer, I could be getting over it right now.
Beer!
Beer!
All right!
All right!
Everybody just leave him alone!
Ok?
Because he may be a liar, but at least hes not a back stabber like Eric.
Stay outta this, Buela.
Oh, dont call me that.
Oh, sorry!
Buela.
Fine!
You know what?
Donna kissed Hyde last year.
What?
Dont mess with me!
Thats thats a lie, Hyde kissed me.
Well, that is just so much better!
How could, how could you do this, man?
Guess Im just a born trouble maker.
Or maybe you turned me into one.
You are so dead, Buela!
Hey, hey!
Leave her alone, all right?
Ok, yeah.
Jackie told me Fez was a better kisser than you, Kelso.
Ah!
Were you ever gonna tell me about Hyde?
Hurts when your friends stab you in the back, dont it?
How would I know?
I have no friends!
Lets go, pal!
STOP IT!
!
Cant you see what is happening?
Those permanent records are tearing us apart.
Batmans right.
Look what weve become.
Were like animals.
Those files are evil, man.
Weve gotta destroy them.
But how, Jackie?
How?
Oh my god, now my Sugar Babies really are gone!
Kitty, Im really sorry about what I said.
You mean, oh no and crap?
Right, thats it.
Im sorry, its just  it was a big shock, you know?
It was a really big shock for me, too and I said, Oh, good!
 And yay!
 No, I I feel like that, too  its just that I well, I  I needed a minute for it to sink in.
But once it sunk in I realized I was really happy.
You really mean that?
Of course I do.
Its gonna be great!
I cant wait to be a father!
Hey, Red!
Great news!
I found a way to drink beer faster!
Come on!
Go home, Frank.
Im busy!
Ok!
Yeah!
Oh, wow.
I think youre maturing!
Well, you know, the truth is, Franks getting on my nerves a little bit.
I mean, hes kinda hes kinda, hes an ass.
And hes dumb.
Hes a   dumbass!
Hey.
Come here.
And then you gave birth to a beautiful daughter!
And then Eric.
Who is just wonderful!
And Ive grown up a lot since then!
Oh, youre dead, kid!
Michael, Im cold.
And this is stupid!
We should just burn the files.
Jackie, theyve already been in a fire.
They cant be destroyed that way.
See you in Hell, permanent records.
And we have to swear well never speak of this ever again.
Except the part about Kelso buying us beer.
Yeah, naturally.
But otherwise its like  this night never happened, ok?
Ok.
Buela.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Hey dad, can I go to Vanstock with the guys this weekend?
What the hell's a Vanstock?
Well, it's like Woodstock, but, with a greater emphasis on vans.
Sounds stupid.
Have a good time.
Oh, then daddy, since Eric is going out of town, can I have his car?
Why?
Where are you going?
Excuse me, I was talking to daddy.
I know.
Where are you going?
Frat party.
Frat party?
No.
But daddy  Look, honey!
It's up to Eric.
Really?
Well, I mean I guess NO!
Well that's settled, then.
Red, what are you gonna do today?
Well, read the want ads, look for a job, then just to break up the day I thought I'd go down to Recksol, look for some Gold Bond for my athlete's foot.
Any more questions?
Well, oh boy, Red, we've got the big hospital banquet to look foreward to.
Oh, right.
Well, then.
Screw the Gold Bond, I gotta get my hair done!
Well honey, I don't think it's gonna be that bad.
And, if it is, I can always give you a shot of Demerol.
You have Demerol?
I mean, what's, what's Demerol?
So!
Donna and I are all set for Vanstock.
Whoa!
No-Donna can't come with us!
Why not?
Well, it's kinda complicated  Hey, Kelso.
So what time are we leaving for Vanstock?
No!
Yeah.
No!
Yeah!
No!
I guess you should have given me your car, Eric.
Now I'll be with you and Kelso all weekend.
How could you ask Laurie?
Well, Jackie didn't wanna go.
What choice did I have?
Aw, man.
See, now you see my problem.
Since Laurie's going, I'm gonna have to make out with her.
And if Donna goes she's gonna see me making out with Laurie and then tell Jackie!
Therefore, Donna can't go!
Or, you could just not make out with my sister.
Be serious, Eric.
Ok, look.
Donna's coming, and if that blows your weekend then, too bad.
Fine.
But you know what?
You're making cheating a lot harder than it has to be.
Kitty and I used to watch the soaps all the time.
So now it's like you're Kitty.
Don't you have a TV at home?
It's too big.
I have to turn my head to see who's talking.
It hurts my neck.
Ooh!
Shh!
Shh!
It's starting.
Ok.
That's Heather.
She's carrying Jeff's baby only  Jeff is in intensive care, he's got a bullet in his brain.
Isn't he the lucky bastard.
Donna, check it out.
I've been working on this all morning and I'm pretty proud.
I zipped our two sleeping bags together to make one.
Look, uh, throw your stuff in the back, I'm gonna go get some snacks for the road.
Ok.
Oh!
Hi!
Donna.
So, that's the carpet.
I was just showing Laurie the carpet.
I need some help with my stuff.
I'm gonna give her some help with her stuff.
Well, I hope you like tuna fish sandwiches, 'cause that's all we got.
I just saw Kelso and your sister making out in the van.
Oh, no, that's uh  Did you know about this?
Did I?
Uh, no!
No!
I didn't know about this!
Hey, Hyde!
Dona just saw Kelso and Laurie making out!
So?
Aren't you shocked?
I'm shocked!
For one to have learned about this!
Hey guys!
I decided to go!
I thought it'd be fun to surprise Michael.
That would be fun!
Um, Jackie, look, you know, before we surprise Kelso, there's something going on that you should know.
What?
You know, vanstock is gonna be really boring, and it's gonna be muddy, and you know there's a good chance there's gonna be some Canadians there.
Eeeew!
!
!
No, no, Jackie, you should go.
You can't let the Canadians win!
Fez, put my stuff in the back.
Hey, Jackie.
You know what would be the perfect surprise for Kelso?
We'll pull the curtains, and you hide in the back with us.
And at some point, you jump up front and yell surprise!
Oh my god, that is perfect!
Now, hop in the van before Kelso sees you.
Hurry up!
Oh, this may be the best road trip ever.
So, you wanna shift?
It's an automatic.
I know.
Surprise!
-- Brad.
How could you sleep with my wife?
You're my brother.
--I'm not your brother.
And I'm not Brad.
Holy cow!
I didn't see that coming.
Wait'll Rachel finds out!
But Rachel's about to dump Brad for Jeff!
No!
Jeff's in a coma!
Oh, come on, Midge.
She can't love a guy in a coma?
What the hell kinda love is that?
Look at this.
Jackie brings four different types of mascara just to please Kelso.
And what does Kelso bring?
An other woman.
Fez, you should really stop going through other people's stuff.
It's kind of creepy.
So, how long do you think this whole thing has been going on?
Whoo, I, you know, I don't know, that's anyone's guess.
Right, Fez?
What?
Kelso and Laurie!
See, ha, Fez doesn't even know!
I don't know, I gue-you know, it's just, it's like, god, this is so wrong, you know?
So what are we gonna do?
I guess just let this all blow over.
Then Jackie and Kelso can get married, have kids, and be really unhappy.
So!
Let's not let this ruin our vanstock experience, ok?
Look at this.
Bubble gum LipSmacker.
What a waste.
So, you kids having fun?
Nothing like a road trip to get to know each other.
Yeah.
Right.
Like, Jackie and Laurie.
They don't really know each other, and yet, they have so much in common.
Like what?
Oh!
Well, you both have really neat hair.
He's right!
I love your hair.
What do you use?
Hot rollers.
So do I!
I hate styling wands.
So do I!
See?
You two keep talking.
There may be plenty of other things that you have in common.
No!
No talking.
It makes the driver nervous.
So just everybody not talk.
Ok.
Let's just sing songs.
Who knows the words to "Three's Company"?
I do!
No singing!
Come and knock on our door  Come and knock on our door!
We've been waiting for you  We've been waiting for you!
Where the kisses are hers and hers and his three's company too!
Wow, man, Vanstock!
It's exactly how I pictured it!
Has anyone seen my top?
I lost my top!
Actually, it's even better than I pictured it!
Do not take the blue acid!
If you have taken the blue acid, please report to the red cross tent!
Look at this debauchery.
This is the smelly underside of a once great nation.
Ooh, yum!
Candy apples!
Hey, man!
What'd you say we go help that chick find her top?
Nah, gotta stay here with the old balls and chains.
You know, Kelso, did you ever think about being honest with them?
Maybe they won't be mad?
Maybe, they'll like the idea of sharing you!
Man, that'd be great, huh?
You think they'd go for that?
Cause that's been, like-Oh ho no!
You're trying to set my up, Hyde!
You never know if you don't try, man!
Are you serious?
Be serious, 'cause this is serious.
This has been a dream of mine since I was a kid and saw "The Parent Trap".
There you go!
Ok!
We're heading off to the restroom!
Ok.
Oh, man, they're going to the restroom?
You know what girls do in the restroom, right?
Oh, I like to pretend like they don't do that.
Not that, man, they talk!
So?
To each other!
Oh my god!
Girls!
Wait up!
What a maroon.
Well, Red, this is Doctor Browning, and uh, Doctor Cloak.
So you're Kitty's husband, eh?
She's a little spitfire!
We couldn't run the ward without her.
Oh, well, you could, but everyone would die!
Ah, so Red, uh, what do you do?
About what?
Um, uh, Red used to be in management at the auto parts plant.
Oh, that's great.
Uh, what do you do now?
About what?
Oh my gosh, Red look, they have an open bar!
No, he's not his brother!
He's not even Brad!
But he looks just like him.
That's the point.
You know, I don't understand why you watch if you're not gonna pay attention!
I'm sorry about Red.
He's just, he's been a tiny bit cranky since he lost his job.
Kitty, it's fine.
I know, everything's fine.
He just um, he, he sits around and he mopes all day.
He, he once told me that if he ever started watching soaps I should shoot him, and I gotta tell ya, I am gosh darn tempted!
Well, you know, when my wife is upset, I do something extra special for her, like surprise her with some candy.
Does Red have a sweet tooth?
Um, no, no, uh, more of a beer tooth.
Oh, for god sakes.
You're a nurse and you can't love a guy in a coma?
What the hell kind of hospital is this?
Wow, look at the stars.
Yeah.
Your sister's kind of a slut.
I noticed that.
How is it that she turned out so awful and you turned out so nice?
Ah, well you see Ok, Donna, there's something you should know.
Oh my god, you're pregnant.
It's nice to laugh, isn't it.
'Cause, I kinda knew about Kelso and Laurie all along, and didn't tell you.
Excuse me?
Which was wrong, but now I'm being honest, which is right, right?
Get out of this bag.
No, wait, Donna, just, please listen- Fine, I'll get out.
Oh, this is the worst vanstock ever!
And now, another episode of Point Place.
My god Kitty.
What have I become?
I don't know.
You're not the man I married!
And I'm not Kitty.
What are you saying?
I am Kitty.
But I am leaving you for Dr. Cloak.
Or should I say, Eric's real father.
But why?
He has a job.
What do you have, Red Forman?
What do you have?
I've got nothing.
Dear god.
Will I ever work again?
Ok!
I'm back!
So.
Penny for your thoughts.
Well, one thing I'm thinking.
I gotta stop watching the soaps.
Well, I think that is a good idea.
Ha!
So listen, um, I brought you home a special little treat  Ohhh!
Ahh!
Hey!
That's a nice beer!
Yes it is.
What's the occasion?
It's um, to celebrate your new job.
But Kitty.
I didn't get a job.
Not yet, but I know you will!
Thanks sweetie.
Tell you one thing.
I bet I get a job before Jeff gets outta that coma.
Hey, how's it going?
Well, uh, found the top, just lost the girl.
Bummer.
Yeah.
What are you doing up?
Punishing Eric.
Knew all about Kelso and Laurie.
Didn't even tell me.
What a bastard.
Oh, like you didn't know.
Of course I knew.
Everybody knew.
You're the only one that didn't know.
Shut up Hyde, I'm mad at him.
Look, you don't rat on your friends.
That's just the way it is.
Now I'm laying traps left and right trying to get Kelso caught.
But I'm not gonna tell on him, cause then I'd be a rat.
And that's what Forman would've been if he had told you.
He still shoulda told me.
Give him a break, Donna.
I mean, the guy kisses your ass.
He does everything for you and you're not even sleeping with him.
Yeah, I guess that's true.
You're lucky he even talks to you!
In fact, I would have dumped you months ago!
But you know, I'm old fashioned, so  Ok, Hyde, thanks for the heart to heart.
Ah, get bent.
Alright, well, I'm off to find the jugs that fit this top.
Like Cinderella.
Excuse me, miss?
Yeah, who is it?
It's me.
Hey, Jackie.
Laurie.
Fez.
Good evening Michael.
Well, aren't we all cozy.
So!
Where am I gonna sleep?
Uh, gee Kelso, I don't think there's any room.
But it's my van!
I can sleep with you anytime!
Tonight, I'm really enjoying girl talk with Laurie!
And why does he get to stay?
Well I am not a girl, but I do enjoy the girl talk.
Get outta the van, Fez!
No, be nice to Fez!
Go away, Michael.
Shut the door.
Hey!
Move over.
You're not mad at me anymore?
Nope.
So, what are you thinking?
That Kelso's an idiot and if I say anything to Jackie, it'll hurt her.
Yes, exactly.
And you know what else?
You're like, a really great boyfriend.
All right!
Well, all right!
Thank god I found you guys.
I'm freezing.
Scoot over.
What?
Kelso!
No!
Wow, this is a roomy bag, huh?
Sorry if I'm a little wet.
What the hell is that smell?
Oh, I found these two dogs, and we started wrestling, man, it was so cool.
All right, goodnight.
No, Kelso, get out!
Get out!
- You smell like a dog!
- That smell!
Get out!
Well where am I supposed to sleep?
No one cares!
Fine!
Ok, this is nice!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Oh my God!
Did you hear that?
It sounds like a bloody hook scraping against the backdoor.
Whats wrong, youre like a millions miles away?
I dont know.
Its just like my parents are fighting like all the time.
It just makes me so mad.
Like I wanna kick their asses but I cant.
I wanna do something!
Okay Take me Donna!
What?
!
Go ahead, take me!
Punish your parents by using me for sex!
Do your business and be done with it!
Go ahead!
Dont be shy!
I can take it!
ButGoddo be gentle!
You didnt actually think that was gonna work did you?
No, but Im a virgin and its driving me crazy.
But thats not your fault.
No wait, YES it is!
How do you do that?
Do what?
You always make me feel better.
Uhm, well thank you.
I love you Eric.
I lovecake!
Morning Bob!
Mornin Red!
Probably wondering why Im in your car eh?
No.
Just get out and have a nice day.
Midgy and I got into a fight Red, and I walked out!
Guess thatll teach her right?
Well, youre the one sleeping in the car, Bob.
Right, well, thats cause when I stormed out, I sort of forgot some stuff.
You know, keys, wallet, blowdryer.
All I need now is a place to stay maybe with some friends?
Well uhhhwe dont uhh have a blowdryer Bob.
Lauries got a blowdryer, I know!
Cause shes had that Farrah Fawcett hairdo.
Thats not natural!
You know, I wouldnt even need my own room, just a little corner to sleep in!
Bob I really I mean, would youahh cripes.
Okay.
Ah thanks Red!
Your my best friend.
No, Im not!
Do you think when girls have sleepovers, sometimes they play games and giggle and then every once in a while they start out to make out altogether in a big naked heap?
- I sure hope so!
- Me too!
Ahummm..
may I have your attention please?
!
I would like to introduce to you all the new Michael Kelso !
Sooo, what do you think?
!
Yeah, Jackie says it makes me look like Marlon Brando in the Wild Ones.
Yeah, Im so Brando!
Yeah, if Brando had a buddy named Potsie!
What are you even saying?
I think you know what Im saying.
EYYYY!
Jackie, did you dress me up like the Fonz?
No Michael, I did not dress you up like the Fonz!
Although I mean I like the Fonz you know hes kinda Fez?
!
Fonz, yes or no?
Well you know me Kelso, I just want you to be happy.
Thank you Fez!
Now, if I could just have a moment of your time?
Sure!
Good, yes.
Okay a gang of tugs has taken over our town!
Help us Fonzie, you are our only hope!
I cant believe you guys!
Here I am, as Brando as can be, and you guys cant even see that!
Well you can both just Sit on it?
!
Why is Bob in my bathtub?
You told me you sent him home, thats what you said, he went home!
He did go home.
And then Midge kicked him out.
But he went home!
Well, now hes back!
Red, he is IN my bathtub!
I cant have him in my bathtub!
His afro-gel is gonna leave a ring!
This isnt easy on me either Kitty!
He tried to talk to me about his feelings!
He almost started to cry!
I really wanted to punch him!
Bob cant stay here Red.
I know that makes me a bad person, I dont care.
Im bad so just lets get him out of here!
Well then, go talk to Midge and fix it up.
Ahahahahhh!
NO!
You let the stray in, you find him a home!
Its not that simple Kitty.
Do you want me to go to my unhappy place Red?
Ill talk to Midge first thing in the morning Thank you Red, you wonderful husband.
Now, when youre done with the paper you get upstairs and scrub my tub!
Okay, youre done!
I wont do it!
Well I wont either.
Well I dont know what the hell were gonna do!
Kelso, it was brave of you to come back.
We gave you quite a ribbing.
Yeah, except for this time, I brought a hot fresh pizza!
But its only for my friends who dont make fun of me!
Mmmm pizza!
Kelso man, I got a thousand insults and no pizza is gonna make me .
Is that sausage?
Brilliant bastard!
Guys, let me ask you something, Donna told me she loves me, and then I told her I love cake Thats not bad is it?
Im still cool right?
Okay, I dont know what happened, I just panicked and it popped out, I mean, I dont remember ever wanting to talk about cake.
I wasnt really that hungry.
Cake is good.
But you cannot have sex with cake!
Ofcourse you cannot have sex with Donna either, so Yeah man, you shouldve just lied and told her that you loved her, I love you baby, see and I dont love you isnt that great?
He DOES love her you dope.
Right?
Okay, well, if I admit it, are you guys gonna make fun of me?
Oh Eric, love is not a joke.
This is a joke: knock knock Whos there?
Look if you really do love her, there is only one thing to do man!
Youve got to dump her and live free!
Dont listen to him man, hes stupid.
Heres what you gotta do: she said it, now youve got to say it!
Then shell say it back and everything will be okay.
Oh and get her pizza, cause right now I kinda love Kelso!
Yeah I can do that.
Ill just say it and then Ill be back on top again.
Allright!
So now where was I when Fonzie here moved to town?
Hey!
Give that backtomundo!
Eric!
Eric, are you okay?
What, yeah You look like youve got a stomach-ache or something.
No.
There is nothing wrong with my stomach.
Its just that Ilove you Man!
Haha!
And then he punched me in the arm and said: "Man"!
Oh my God.
What a horrible disaster!
Well go on!
I guess I like totally screwed things up.
Cause ever since I said I love you hes been acting SO weird.
Okay wait a second, Im a little confused, why did YOU say I love you?
Because Ilove him!
Uh Donna!
Thats got nothing to do with it!
YOU are way too young to be saying I love you.
Shut up Jackie, you say it to Kelso all the time and you are like younger than me.
Not in love-years.
Alright look.
Eric doesnt know how to handle that kind of thing.
You probably just scared him off.
All you could do right now is play it cool for a while, turn down the emotional heat and Donna, God willing, hell forget you threw yourself at him.
I know it sounds impossible, but what you just said actually makes sense.
Look the sooner you realise Im a genius, the better off well both be!
Oh, hi Red!
Sorry I cant open the door, but I dont want Bob sneaking back into the house again.
Thats okay, I just came by to see how youre doing.
Oh Im working through some things.
Gotten past denial and Im well on my way to acceptance Yeah well couldnt agree with you more, well anyway Take Bob back!
Red I cant do that right now.
Midge, Ive talked to Bob, and hes really sorry.
Now be a sport and take him back!
I cant.
- TAKE HIM BACK MIDGE!
- NO!
TAKE HIM!
NO!
THIS ISNT OVER PINCIOTTI!
Donna, check it out.
Hey Kelso!
Popsicle!
Where did it go?
Perhaps it went under the couch?
Jackie, lets get out of here, this is kinda lame Yeah sure.
Wait Donna!
So Ill see you later?
NO!
Youre never gonna see me again!
Ha!
Shes a little pistol huh What did you do?
!
Nothing!
I did what you said!
I told her I loved her!
Youre LYING!
No its true!
Exceptexcept, I might have..
you know popped her one on the shoulder and called her man.
You idiot!
Wait!
This isnt my fault!
Its YOUR fault!
You said if I told her I loved her shed say it back, but she didnt man!
She just stared at me!
Well did you give her a chance to answer?
!
How long did you wait before you completely muffed out?
Forever man!
Likefive minutes!
Youre LYING!
No its true, it was like well maybe just a couple of seconds, but I..
Time ceased to exist okay!
I was just hangin out there, really far out there, justhangin !
Eric contributes in class but does not follow directions!
MAN, where the heck is that fudgesicle?
!
Hey, is that my fudgesicle?
No, this ones mine.
Damn, where is my fudgesicle?
!
Just tell me how am I supposed to fix this?
!
Well, first of all, you need to learn how to handle a little woman troubles without getting all freaked out.
Its pretty unmanly man.
Laurie!
Hahahahahahaha!
EYYYYYYY!
Thats IT, I hate this stupid thing!
Laurie laughing at me But Kelso, I thought we were supposed to handle our woman troubles like a man?
You shut up!
You just SHUT UP!
And if anybody else here laughs at me, I swear, Im gonna kick SO MUCH ass!
And thats MY fudgesicle!
Im telling you man, that jacket is the best thing that ever happened to us!
I cant do it now Kitty, hes sleeping!
BOOOOOBB!
Oh, Bob, youre awake!
Hi!
Lets see it was ehm it was no go with Midge.
She doesnt wanna see you.
Boy thats a shame Red.
Guess its you and me buddy.
Well thats a problem.
I like you Bob, you dont borrow my things, you keep your lawn mowed, but the fact of the matter is, youre a little bit youre kind of a Youre an ass.
Yeah?
Well its not your fault.
Weve gotta stop pussyfootin around here and somehow get you back in that house!
How?
!
Oh, its you.
Im NOT taking him back Red!
No no no no, Im just gonna trim a few of these branches for you.
Oh okay.
HELP!
Midge!
Im trapped under this very heavy branch!
HELP!

RED!
Are you hurt?

GOOOO!
Im IN!

Red, that was NOT nice!
Im not sorry Midge!
Great shot!
And I love you.
Well the basket doesnt really count because I travelled.
You could never travel.
Because I love you.
Eric, youre acting like a huge dork.
A huge dork who loves you.
God stop it!
Alright, look the only reason I said it is because I felt it.
And not just so youd say it back.
And if I knew you would get in such a twist about it, I wouldnt have said it at all!
Im NOT in a twist!
Its just cake okay that was pretty stupid.
Yes!
Thank you!
So, I mean, why did you say it?
I dont know, I just now, once IT is out there, if we broke up, I mean, what would I tell myself then?
I guess you could tell yourself you still have cake, we both know how much it means to you!
Thats nice, there is a sweet girl Okay, look, I have an idea.
Why dont we pretend it just never happened?
- I like that - Now.
- never happened!

Okay Bob, how much did you think about this?
Youre living in the same house, but youre dating other people.
Im not saying for sure therell be problems, but I want you to think about it.
Think hard Bob!

{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You know, Donna, Im not surprised youre in my bed, I knew you couldnt resist me any longer.
No, I couldnt.
I want you.
I need you.
Well, I never turn down a woman in need.
You know, being here, in your bed, on your Spiderman sheets makes me feel so ready.
So willing.
Then call me able.
A little mood music.
Damn.
Whats wrong?
I mean, hey, baby!
I cant believe youre in my bed!
I cant believe you came through my window!
I know.
Oh, well, I was just sitting at home thinking about you and  I thought, why dont I crawl up the side of his house and say hello?
So, hello!
Hello!
Thats-did, did anyone see you?
Um, just Hyde.
Excuse me.
I heard a noise downstairs and it scared me.
Man, youre ruining what could be the most important night of my life here.
Heh, heh, well duh.
This is so-I cant believe this!
Youve never been in my bed before!
I know.
Im in your bed!
Youre in my bed!
Youre in my bed!
Youre in my bed.
Ok, uh, uh, because the bed squeaks.
Because the walls are thin.
Because Red has the ears of a wolf.
Uh, reasons my parents might hear us if we do it.
Right!
Ok ok, um, uh, gee, mom, it was hot, so we took off our clothes, and then we got cold, so we got under the covers, and things just started bouncing around  Uh, things I might say if my folks catch us doing it!
Yes!
Ok, um, uh, um, Vonda, Ford, the eighth  Famous Henrys!
Yes!
Oh, ok, um, um, because theres a girl in your bed.
Because theres a girl in your bed!
Because theres a girl in your bed, damn it!
Reasons to go for it!
Yes!
So, I, uh  Oh, so shes gonna be out the whole week?
Well, you dont drink and go ice fishing!
That is just common sense!
No, no, no, its fine, Ill be happy to pick up her shifts.
Ok.
Uh-huh!
Bye.
Oh, geez, Kitty, you work so hard as it is, I dont want you working double shifts!
Well, Red, we need the money.
You know its not every week that Charlenes gonna get septicemia from a rusty hook.
We have gotta take advantage of that!
Well, I dont like it.
Oh, you know, if Im gonna be working nights, I better put some meals together for you and the boys.
Oh, come on, Kitty!
Im not helpless.
I think I can get these guys some dinner.
Ok, yeah, um, Im sure youll be great!
Fire extinguisher is in the garage.
So moneys a little tight, huh?
No, no, Steven.
Everythings fine.
Were great.
Good morning!
And I am not just saying that.
Listen, your mothers working double shifts, so, Ill be cooking.
You know the fire extinguishers in the garage, right?
Yeah.
I know.
Im gonna have cereal.
Oh, youll be having a lot of cereal.
So wheres Donna, man?
Donna?
Donna?
Oh!
You mean that girl who spent last night in my bed?
Yeah, yeah, thats the one.
She went home this morning.
So?
Ah?
Ah?
Soooo?
So lets just say she went home a very happy woman.
All right, man, you finally did it.
You know, it  can mean a lot of things.
No, it means one thing.
And you either did it, or you didnt.
Ok, then we didnt.
But, we did plenty of good stuff.
New stuff!
Plenty of good, new stuff!
Ah, man, youre bumming me out.
Cant you at least just lie to me?
Uh, ok, we did it.
Liar.
So, do you like photos, man?
Yeah, man.
Sure.
Ok, you got the job, man.
Just like that?
You dont have to interview anybody else?
Nobody else showed up, man.
So, what do I do here anyway?
Well I dont expect a lot, man.
Pretty much if the hut doesnt burn down, its been a good day.
And even if it burned down, man, its cool, cause Ive got three or four more of these little huts somewhere.
Hey, listen, if you see one of these huts, could you give me a call, man?
Or even better, I could take a picture!
Heh.
Whoa!
A picture of a photo hut!
Hey, thatd be like art or something, huh?
Hey, listen, man.
I hope you dont mind if I pay you in cash.
I dont like big brother getting into my business, ya dig?
Man, keeping the government out of it, Im so with you!
No, my big brother, man.
Hes always hitting me up for money.
Oh.
Cause youre the responsible one?
Yeah, its my curse, man.
Hey, listen!
I gotta go do a thing at a, a place.
Yeah, man, I hear that.
So do you want me to lock up when Im done?
Lock up!
Wow, thats a great idea, man!
Hey, youre one of those idea men, arent you, man?
Yeah, maybe someday youll be working for me, huh?
Really?
Oh, thatd be cool, man.
Hey, but can I have Saturday night off?
Cool.
So, you know what?
What?
Oh, I cant tell you.
Oh my god!
Now you have to tell me!
Even if its not about me, I wanna hear it.
I was really bad last night.
Did you shoplift?
I knew it!
No!
I slept with Eric last night.
Oh my god!
Oh my god!
Was it great?
Yeah!
I was asleep!
Eeew!
No!
No, Jackie, we were both asleep.
So nothing happened?
Well, you know, some things happened.
We mostly slept.
You mean, you were in his bed, and he didnt whine and beg for like, two hours until you were so sick of hearing his stupid voice that you just gave in so he would shut up?
No.
I love him!
He just, like, held me all night.
Oh my god!
Thats so sweet!
Michaels just after me all the time!
I mean, I understand, cause Im sexy and all, but still!
Like, ok, he always says, Why cuddle when we could do it?
 Well, was he always like that?
No.
No, I guess things kinda changed after we did it.
But in a good way.
I love it when Eric holds me.
Yeah, I love it when Michael buys me stuff.
Well, guys, Im a little ashamed to admit this, but I got a job.
Yeah, Im thinking about getting a job at a chip factory.
I gotta know how they do this!
Yeah, Red wont let me get a job.
He says if I dont study hard and get into college, once I turn eighteen hes gonna kill me!
And I think hes serious, man.
Hyde, did you ever stop to think, how you working will make me go to the mall alone today?
You didnt think, did you?
No.
Sorry.
Hey, guys, check this out, man.
Forman had Donna in his bed last night, and he didnt even do it!
Whats up?
Youre a bonehead, man!
Im not a bonehead!
I mean, we did other stuff, and we cuddled!
It was great.
Sometimes, when Im alone, I just love to cuddle.
Forman, she climbed up the trellis of your house, through your window, to get into bed with you, and cuddle?
Sorry, man.
I never read that letter in Penthouse.
Those stories are true, you know.
Why would you just cuddle with her, when you could do it?
I mean, Forman, doing it is it.
Thats why they call it it!
IT!
!
Guys, it was just one night.
There are gonna be lots of other nights!
Eric, opportunity does not knock, and then ring the doorbell, and then knock again, and then leave a note that says, sorry, I missed you, and then call you on the phone- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it, Fez.
And we get it.
What my foreign friend here is trying to say, Forman, is that you blew it, man!
And you blew it, man!
Im losing my patience with you, man.
You gotta get with her!
I mean, theres nothing more beautiful than when two people fit together perfectly like  well, like two of these potato  HOWD THEY DO THIS?
Hey.
Yeah.
You wanna eat this?
No.
Well, its in there if you change your mind.
You know, I loved being here with you the other night.
Great!
Cause I love that you came over.
It didnt, like, bother you that I was sleeping with you in your little single bed?
No, it bothered me, but, in a really good way.
Ok.
Good.
Um, so you wanna come over tonight?
Yeah!
Cool.
Id love to.
Great!
Cause Im like, wide open.
Cool.
So Ill see you tonight?
Ok.
Geez, you didnt eat that fish, did you?
Cause I was just kidding!
No.
All right.
Stop acting weird.
Hello, Mr. Forman.
How are you doing today?
Damn!
That pots no good.
That pot would not have boiled over had you put some salad oil in the water.
So you know how to boil water.
Dont you, uh, have some place you need to be?
Not really.
If I go home too early, my host parents make me read scripture.
Well, why dont you, uh go sit in the basement.
All right!
Well.
What do you know?
Haji had it right!
Hey, man.
So this is where you work, huh?
Yeah, thats what they say.
Hey, wont you get in trouble if the boss shows up?
Oh no, is the boss here?
Hey, wait, Im the boss!
You know, maybe third times the charm.
Maybe this time, itll be really, really super.
Ta-da!
Oh my gosh, Red.
Fried chicken, and mashed potatoes, coleslaw, oh, and a little half a ear of corn.
Oh!
I forgot the biscuits!
Nice, huh?
Oh!
Its really nice!
Whered you hide the bucket, Red?
Here.
Have a wet nap.
All right!
The Colonel!
Oh, um, there you go.
Well now, what is this?
Look, I got a job, all right?
And I dont wanna hear anything about, were fine, because I know moneys tight around here, and you wont let Forman work, so just, take the money and drop it!
Oh, hes a keeper.
You know, Im gonna take that money, and open him a savings account.
Well, thats nice, Red.
Or blow it all on booze, I still havent make up my mind!
Ah, its my good friend, Eric.
So what will it be?
Gilligans Island, pin ball, Stratego, you decide.
Well, actually Fez, uh, Donnas coming over tonight.
So Im just here to get my Barry White album.
Otherwise, I would just love  Blah, blah, blah, just go.
Oh, baby, I am ready for love.
Why, hello, Ive been expecting you.
Yawn!
So, you ready for bed?
Sure!
Ok.
What, no Spiderman sheets ?
Well, I just just use those on wash day, so  Eric, could we like, slow down for a second?
Sure!
Well, remember the other night, when we just like  cuddled all night?
I really liked that.
Right!
Yeah!
But I was thinking, why cuddle when we could do it?
Ok, youve been talking to those idiots in the basement again.
No!
Yes!
Look, Eric, I know its a long drive.
And, and were gonna get there!
Were gonna get there, but, I dont know, I just, I wanna see some trees along the way.
Ok.

- Youll be driving.
Yes.
You swear to god?
I do!
I swear to god!
Ok.
Ok, good.
Because I do love you.

Oh theyre hot!
The blond is blondand hot!
Yes, and since I set us up on this date, shes mine, right?

Once again, the local custom bones the foreign guy.
America man!
Love it or leave it.
This, this is Camomile the camel, he can sit in the backseat.
But Lama Cass here, she has to sit up in the front with us!
Jackie, its just I thought all you wanted was to put in one little animal.
Well I know Michael, but this way, there will be even more things to remind you of me.
Dont you like thinking about me?
No ofcourse I do, the thing is, how can I say this without hurting your feelings Oh okay, I dont want you stupid things in my cool van!
OH!
NO!
I didnt say you were stupid, just everything you like!
Congratulations Eric, you got suspended.
Are you getting dumber?
Gee I dont think so.
Look dad, I dont smoke.

Okay you know thats enough.
Eric have some more pot roast, here is some mashed potatoes and here is a photo of a cancerous lung WOW!
Mom, gross!
Look, I dont smoke!
Okay, well either way, that is whats gonna happen to your lungs if you keep on smoking.

Nope, Im pretty sure its Eric.
Well, thats kinda stupid Bob.
Well I guess the truth hurts.

Its hard work, but..

I bet you make really good punch huh  Oh my gosh the best!

If you tried to send a sexy message, then message recieved!
Well Fez, I know we made out in my parents bedroom and I know we frenched in the poolhouse and I know that may seem romantic to some people Tell me something I dont know!
I have a boyfriend.
See, that I did not know!
Fez I really like you, but hes in college and were still faithful.
I see.
You know, there are many ways to remain faithful yet still have fun!
Really?
- Oh yes.
Ahhh, thats much better!
- Hey.
- Hey.
So I told Bob and Midge that it was my cigarette.
And how did that go?
Really good, they grounded me.
Cool.
So what are you doing over here?
Snuck out.
Being grounded makes it so much naughtier!
You know Donna, Im not gonna tell you what to do, but failing classes is not the only way to get attention from your parents, I mean, for instance, a lot of girls when theyre having a bad time at home just go slutty!
You know what Eric?
Youre right!
Lets have sex RIGHT NOW!
- Really?

It was horrible.
It was all: Youre the devil Midge OH Bob, shut up OH Bob, shut up, thats classic!
Man if you get any dumber youre gonna need a helmet.
Bummer for Donna huh, cant believe theyre sleeping in seperate bedrooms.
Yeah I know.
Wait I dont know, what are you talking about?
Well, Hyde knows something about Donna that Eric does not know.
This is an interesting development, lets watch Midge is sleeping in the guestbedroom man.
How did you know that?
Did Donna tell you that?
Look Forman, its not a big deal.
I guess shes just telling me stuff shes not telling you.
See, this is why communication is so important.
Now, Michael and I always Excuse me, we were talking about Donna and me and how Oh hush, no-one cares!
Now, Michael never keeps secrets from me, do you sweetie?
Huh?
Oh, no, never.
Michael, you hesitated!
Why did you hesitate?

Okay here now maybe this cheese toast will make your birthday happy.
No Kitty, I think I have lost my appetite God that is a great looking T-bone!
Is there butter on this?
Hoehaa!

Now Im gonna eat this steak, but first, Im gonna make a birthday wish.
Here it is: I wish everyone would shut up!
Something wrong?
No.
So, is there anything on your mind?
Someone you might wanna talk to?
No ERIC in his mind: Dont take no for an answer, she talked to Hyde, get her to talk to you.
Get her to Oh my God, that cant be her tongue, can it?
How is she doing that?
!
SosoftsoWAIT!
Focus!

Thats a pretty littleshirt ERIC in his mind: Holy God, shes sucking my tongue, shes sucking my tongue, oh my God even her spit is sweet, its like licking jelly there is something wrong with me No theres not, Im seventeenWAIT!
So NOTHING?
To confide?
In me?

And theyre very smart, they can count you know.
Oh honey honey, you justyou just gotta shut up!
Speaking of, has anyone read ?

I gave a copy to Midge, but no offence sweetie, it may be a little too deep for her.
Wait a minute!
What do you mean, no offence?
Well I mean, dont be offended.
Oh!
Listen, you insult my wife one more time you're gonna be wearing your steak as a hat!
Im sorry!
Oh Bob that was so sweet!

You big bear!
Rooaarrr!
I errr..
left my wallet in the car Midge!
OH, I left my sex with Bob in the car!
Check please!
Ah there you go, thats for you!
Come on Kitty Donna wouldnt even talk to me, she just kept sticking her tongue down my throat.
Oh boohoo Forman!
You get to fool around with a totally hot chick and you never have to talk about her feelings.
Ts, you poor french-kissing bastard.
Yeah Hydes right.
One time I asked Jackie what was wrong, and she didnt shut up for like three straight days.
You know Kelso, sometimes you do not know what you have until it is gone.
And then someone else has it, and it is not you, and then that someone else is really happy.
What are you talking about?
You dont know what hes talking about?
I say get the helmet Kelso put this on!
Shut up, Im not putting the helmet on!
And what are you talking about?
Ill tell you what Im talking about if you put the helmet on.
FINE!
If you dont take care of Jackie, you are going to lose her.
Pfffttt.
thats just stupid!
Look Hyde, all I know is that youre talking to my girlfriend and I dont like it.
Hey man, I was friends with Donna before you ever became her little boyfriend.
Hyde, youre pissing me off!
Why dont you think Forman, you get to make out with one of the hottest chicks in Wisconsin, while Im being all sympathetic and relating my crappy life to her, and Im pissing you off?
Youre supposed to be the friend and IM supposed to be the make-out guy!
Now that I think about it, youre pissing ME off!
What the hell kind of a world are we living in?
Hey, lets date other people, hey, lets date other people but ditch them and do it in a car!
Thats enlightend?
In my days we called them degenerates and we stoned them!
With big rocks!
Oh, you did not.
Well, we should have.
Well you know, your birthday is not over for another two hours Oh Kitty, we have no ceiling on our bedroom.

{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
So uhm, Laurie is almost all packed.
I cant believe my little girl is moving out.
Which reminds me, when are you leaving?
NEVER!
Cause I LOVE it here!
Right.
Kitty, do you really think this is a good idea?
I mean it might be a little soon for her to be on her own.
Red, shes gonna be fine, shes gonna split rent with a girlfriend.
She doesnt even have a job!
Well she is gonna get a job!
Oh, that reminds me, can I have her room?
No, I already gave it to Stephen.
But Im your son!
Daddy?
Man , would you look at this place?
Its kinda girlie.
Its a girls room Hyde.
Oh, so all those guys, they were just passing through?
Well, thats over.
Welcome to Hydeville baby!
You know, if I cared about this dump at all, that would totally creep me out.
Come on Laurie, youre gonna miss your room.
Its not like you have no feelings.
Ever.
About anything.
YES!
Im so psyched!
Owww, did you finally figure out how a thermos works?
Noooo, Im psyched about your new place you know.
Cause whenever we fool around here Im always afraid that Jackies gonna catch us.
And I dont wanna hurt her, cause I love her.
So this is great, it solves everything.
Kelso, you are not allowed anywhere near my new place.
EVER!
Laurie You know what, you freaks, you got about two minutes to deal with this little drama here, then get the hell out of my room!
Wow, I see whats going on here, youre breaking up with me.
No.
For me to break up with you, there would have to be something between us to break.
OHHH!
I cannot believe that youre being SUCH a Bitch?
Duhhh!
Look Kelso, it was fun, and sweaty and all, but youre just a guy I fooled around with when there was nothing good on TV.
Sorry.
Well, maybe there wont be anything good on TV at your new place!
Oh DAMN there is always something good on TV!
Hey Kelso, look whos here!
Its Jackie!
Hi Jackie!
God Laurie, I cant believe youre moving!
I know we didnt spend much time together, but I think some of my good taste was rubbing off on you.
And Im so happy for that!
Thanks Jackie!
Im gonna miss you too!
Oh Kelso, I almost forgot, I found a t-shirt of you when I was cleaning out my room Say..
how did that get there?
Thats funny, this isnt even mine!
Yeah I know, this must be Erics shirt.
Your mom sewed your name in it Michael!
MAN, Erics gonna be pissed huh!
Jackie see, I borrowed Erics shirt cause mine wasnt working right.
And uh then my mom must have sewed my name in it.
Hm, I dont know Michael.
What, do you think Im lying?
Jackie, if I were lying, Id come up with a lot better lie then that.
Yeah, youd think so!
So Laurie is definitely moving out?
And its definitely over with her and Kelso?
Well, she is moving all the way across town, I mean, she is slutty but..
I mean she hates to commute.
Good.
Good, because Kelso is a rat-bastard and Im not covering for him.
Donna relax, its over.
So now you can get back to pleasing your man.
Eric please leave.
I have to talk to Donna alone.
Well okay, cause I mean, its not like this is my home or any ERIC!
Jackie, you have something you wanna ask me?
See, Im kinda worried about Michael and Laurie.
I mean, she found his t-shirt in her room, and he said it wasnt his even though it had his name in it.
And at that time I believed him.
But now I cant remember why.
But if there is something going on, I think I wanna know.
But I dont wanna know.
That even if I wanna know, you know?
Im supposed to say?
Donna, youre supposed to say that there is nothing going on, that Michael loves me and were together and thats all that matters.
That sounds good.
GOD youre so NAIVE!
Isnt there like someone else you could talk to about this?
Yeah well, I used to have this penpal in Nicaragua, but she just stopped writing after that hurricane-thingy Your new room is very pretty.
Like a flower, or a girl.
You know, people might see this room and think you are a gay.
I dont think so Fez.
Oh Hyde, you would be surprised how easily people can make that mistake.
Hey Hyde, thanks for your help with Jackie man.
Sure thing man.
Okay Hyde, do you know what sarcasm is?
No.
Hyde man, you almost got me caught!
I almost got you caught?
My mom sewed my name in Erics shirt ?
Youre so lame man.
You know, half the time you act like you want me to get caught.
Kelso, youre my friend, I dont want you to get caught, cause if you get caught then my fun is over.
So Im just trying to prolong your suffering.
Well okay, thats a little better.
Allright, friends for life baby!
Well Stephen is getting all settled in.
He better not change anything, I dont want him messing with my little girls room.
You know how he is, messy, dirty, foul.
What if she has to move back home?
Oh Red, she is gonna be fine.
I know Kitty, you think that she is all grown up, but there is still a lot that she doesnt know.
I mean what if her place doesnt have a deadbolt?
Or smoke-detector?
Red, you dont have to baby her, shes twenty!
Youre never too old to burn to death in a fire!
Well would you look at this, she found a place in a nice neighbourhood.
Aint she something Well I hope she hasnt had breakfast yet.
Or a fire.
Can I help you?
Duhhh..
no we got the wrong appartment I guess.
Sorry.
Not a problem.
No wait, is Laurie there?
Oh yeah, hold on a second Honey?
Hi Daddy!
go to hell!
!
Honey, whats wrong?
What's wrong ?
Everyhting is wrong!
Damn kids today, they wouldnt know responsibility if it walked up and bit m in the ass!
Get a job, phah, its just party all night, dance all day, and sex everywhere in between!
Sydney!
Laurie is living with a boy?
Yes.
Just one boy right?
Yeah I think so.
Now see, it could have been worse.
Lauries busted!
This is, and I dont think Im exaggerating here, the greatest day in the history of time.
Except maybe the day cheese was invented.
I love the cheese!
Wow man, shes gone one day, and shes already got a new guy.
Kelso you heartbreaker you Im having a horrible day.
Lauries gone and Jackie is all suspicious of me, and Im getting no lovin.
None!
I cant be me without lovin.
Kelso, if you wanna keep Jackie man, and trust me, you dont, you gotta act innocent okay, lets practice.
So, did you fool around with Laurie?
You know I did!
Dumbass NO MAN!
Complete denial!
Watergate!
Learn!
Did you fool around with Laurie?
Yeah.
I mean NO, I mean..
yeah, SEE this isnt gonna work!
Its just so perfect if I could go back in time, Id just relive that moment over and over again Hi daddy!
Hi Daddy!
Hi Daddy!
Just tell Jackie the truth.
Then, if she leaves you for another man, whoever he might be, no hard feelings.
You do not need Jackie.
Sweet, luscious Jackie You are an evil little foreign man.
Dont ever change.
Look Kelso allright, Ill help you out with Jackie man, Ill talk you through the whole thing step by step.
Thanks man.
Yeah I guess it was wrong what I did with Laurie, but I was just amusing myself you know.
And thats the key to life right?
Never stop amusing yourself.
Unless it starts to chafe.
Then you should take a week off.
Something's doesn't right Eric, Im asking you, have I been a bad father?
Maybe Ive been to hard on her.
I mean for Gods sakes, I think Im a fair man.
Right ?
Eric Im talking to you!
Does this need more mayonaise?
Get outta here!
Thank you!
Boy Kitty weve got a pair to beat a full house, thats for sure.
Well Red, relax.
Youre overreacting.
IM overreacting?
!
Well Ill tell you what Kitty, people are gonna talk.
Her living with that guy.
Red, it doesnt matter if people talk, Laurie is still a part of this family, which is why I invited her to dinner tonight.
Oh no no no, Kitty, Im not ready for that.
Oh thats sweet.
The way you say that like you have a choice.
Look Kitty Shes coming!
Well Im glad were all eating dinner together as a family.
Yeah its nice.
Especially since Laurie could make it from all the way across town.
Where she lives.
With some guy.
In sin.
Will you ever hit puberty?
Oh ow, but you know, whats really sad, is that youve got no respect for yourself.
or this family.
Daddy!
Well hes not wrong!
But Daddy!
Red!
Well Kitty, whos gonna buy the cow, when they get the milk for free?
You know Dad, its not like shes hooking.
Or some other less Shes just living with a guy and it is the seventies now right.
What are you babling about?
Well, maybe, maybe I just think youre being a little hard on her.
Well thats nice Eric.
But right now Im too angry to pretend to give a crap about what you think!
These are great potatoes Mrs. Forman!
Thanks Eric.
Yeah sure.
Okay why dont you boys take your plates in and watch some McMillan and wife.
You know just once today Id like to finish a meal without being chased out of the room Well Laurie, you better stop your lying and face up to this one.
Just look at what youre doing to your father.
Mom, Im an adult okay?
No no no, an adult would have told the truth, and not lied about moving with a girlfriend which I knew wasnt true.
WELL MOM, if you already knew then why didnt you tell Dad?
!
Then we wouldnt be in this mess!
Oh my God, Rosemary had a better baby then me Okay, youve been acting kinda weird ever since Laurie gave you that t-shirt Michael.
Hydes head appears next to Kelsos: First off, act innocent!
I dont know what youre talking about Jackie.
Hydes head: Ofcourse, shell explain herself.
Its like youre hiding something.
Hydes head: But you just stick to your original story Im sticking to my original story!
Hydes head: Now, shell be sceptical Jackie: Uhuhhh Hydes head: So go on the offensive!
You know Jackie, youre just being paranoid!
And that hurts because you dont trust me and other stuff Hydes head: And then, shell be so embarrased, shell cave and apologize to you FINE!
I believe you Michael, but know this: if youre NOT telling the truth I wil find out, cause Im smart, and youarent!
Hydes head: And all you have to do is forgive her KELSO : O..
kayJackie I forgive you.
Red, I think youre being a little hard in Laurie.
I dont care what anyone thinks.
What she is doing is wrong.
Now that I think back on it, I dont know if I even knew that girl.
Living with a guy.
Oh is that a foreign car?
!
Oh jeez!
Red, you have gone your whole life thinking she is just a little girl, but she is an adult now.
And she is not a perfect one.
Boy, is she not a perfect one!
But you know what, you have to love your children even when they do things you dont like or better yet, hate.
You think you do a good job.
You think that you teach your children the difference between right and wrong and this is what you get!
Well, to hell with it!
Okay.
I guess we dont love her anymore, lets take all pictures of Laurie out of here and pretend shes not ours and if we see her on the street lets ignore het.
No, lets throw things at her.
Well now youre just being stupid.
And youre not being a good father.
Well..
okay.
Maybe I have been uh kinda of uh A dumbass.
I was gonna say unreasonable Fine, fine, you were an unreasonable dumbass.
Are you done now?
I think I am The Bradys are such a nice family.
I bet Mr. Brady never good hate Marcia.
But then again, Marcia wasnt so whory.
No, she really wasnt!
What?

You love this, Im mean to you, youre mean to me, so come on, hit me!
Sorry, I cant.

About the uhthe thing that happened.
At the place you live.
And uh I want you to know that I understand that youre not my little girl anymore.
I like being your little girl!
But youre not.
Youre my daughter.

Who is going to do awful and stupid things.
But Ill still love you.

Its not in the Candy Land box?
Oh my god, you guys!
Guess whos gonna be in the Miss Dairy Princess Pageant ?
Oh, I know!
A cow?
No.
Me!
A beauty pageant?
Yeah!
I mean, look, Donna.
Its not enough that we know Im prettier than everyone else.
I want the whole world to know!
And what better way to do it than to go onstage and parade around like a piece of meat?
I know!
I know!
And get this!
Michael is gonna be my pageant boy!
Pageant boy!
Jackie, I am not a pageant boy, Im a beauty coach!
Yeah, thats a lot better, Kelso.
So, Donna!
You wanna go see my gown?
Lets go.
Oh, oh, I will help!
I have a way with womens hair.
Lets go, girls.
Man, a beauty coach?
Whats going on with you?
When Jackie wins this pageant, I am gonna be the guy with the hottest chick of all of the hot chicks!
Yeah, Kelso, tha-thats genius.
Yeah.
Just picture it  Announcer: And this years mis Dairy Princess is  Kelsos girlfriend!
Yes!
Thank you!
Thank you, Bob Lumace!
Mr. Kelso, now that youve been crowned, whats going to be your first order of business?
Well, as Mr. Dairy Princess, I would like to give milk products to all of those in need!
And then someday, I would like to rule an entire hot-chick dairy Kingdom !
Whoa, ho ho ho!
Settle down, girls, theres plenty of me to go around you.
Well.
Okay, I gotta go win this thing!
All right, wheres my money?
What money?
The money you stole from my  special place.
You mean, the pathetic bundle of ones you keep in your little Candy Land game?
So, you admit you knew where it was!
Ok, Eric, first of all you were a mistake.
Ask mom and dad.
And second, if I did steal it, Id tell you to your face, and then Id steal it more.
Yeah, that does sound like you, damn, who took my money?
Isnt it obvious who took it?
I mean, think about it.
No morals, lack of character, bad reputation  So you did take it!
No, you idiot, Hyde!
Hes staying down in the basement, hes poor?
He steals stuff?
No.
No, Hyde wouldnt do that to me.
Im sure youre right, Eric.
Hes a real good friend.
So, Kelso tells me Hyde tried to steal Donna last year.
Is that true?
No.
I mean, well, he tried but he didnt succeed.
Hmmm, thats not much better, is it, Eric?
Was I really a mistake?
They sued the condom company.
So?
So, what do you think?
Jackie, if you want to win, that dress needs to be a lot shorter.
Get to Fez!
Hey!
Jackie, lets get to work!
Well, Michael, weve already done a lot.
I mean, I decided on this dress, and Fez is gonna do my hair.
All right, but I-Im gonna tell you something, Jackie.
Ive seen pictures of his people, and they arent pretty.
Bite me, pageant boy.
Coach.
All right, fine, I guess we could use the help.
Fez, you can handle Jackies body and Ill take care of her mind.
So Jackie, does the winner get a scholarship or something?
Tsch, who cares?
College is for ugly girls who cant get modeling contracts.
No, college is for women who dont wanna marry the first idiot they meet, and squeeze out his bastard moron children.
Hey, mom.
When you were cleaning up downstairs, you didnt happen to come across sixty bucks, did you?
Oh, Eric, did you lose your Candy Land cash?
Does everyone know where I keep my money?
Oh, Im sorry, honey, it was a good hiding place.
Oh!
Maybe you put it in Chutes and Ladders!
No!
I checked!
I mean, I dont know who could have taken it!
At first, I thought it was Laurie, but  Oh, honey, no, Laurie wouldnt steal from you, she steals from me.
Right.
So that only leaves one person.
I mean, he does live in the basement.
Oh, ok, now, if you are talking about Steven, Im gonna get mad.
Hes a good apple, and he is your friend, and you can trust him.
Can I?
I mean, no, mom, I hate thinking this, its just, it all adds up!
I mean, if not Hyde, then who?
Well, it could be  ok, you know what?
I do not wanna talk about this anymore.
Ok.
Oh, heh, here comes a dumb question.
Uh, I wasnt a mistake, was I?
Oh, for for  Okay!
Who wants some cocoa?
Ok, Jackie, in thirty seconds or less, what do you hope to accomplish as Miss Dairy Princess, GO!
Um  - Dink, dink,dink, dink .
- Um - Dink, dink, dink, dink  - UM .
BURRRMM!
!
You just lost, lady!
!
Well, Michael, I was thinking!
Oh, really?
Well, in 1974, Miss Alabama started thinking.
Do you know where she is now?
Alabama.
Eeew!
God, Michael, I dont wanna accomplish anything.
I just want the title so I can lawyer it over people!
Thats all I want too, Jackie!
Ok, so the next categorys talent.
I can sing!
Oh, no, you cant sing.
So.
Boy, am I disappointed.
I went to get my money, but, someone stole it.
So, forget the fake gold necklace from Sears.
Now I gotta get Donna a crappy gift!
Hey, what would you guys rather see Jackie do?
Walk a tightrope, or ride a mechanical bull?
Well, either way, shell fall on her ass, so  I like em both!
So, Eric, which rat bastard  do you think stole your money?
Well, I mean, its anyones guess.
For all I know, I mean, it could be someone in this very room!
Whoa-ho-ho!
How exciting.
A mystery.
Is Fez a suspect?
Yeah, probably not, Fez.
Why not?
I can be evil!
I hate you.
See?
Oh, Eric, I dont hate you, I love you, Im sorry!
Thats ok, Fez.
And uh, Im also pretty sure Kelso here didnt take it.
Hey, how long do you guys think Jackie can hold her breath?
Gee, inspector.
So, if it isnt Kelso, and it isnt Fez, I wonder who you could suspect?
Dillhole.
Uh-oh.
Hyde, I didnt say you took it.
You guys know what a funny word is?
Pickle-weasel!
Forman, then say I didnt take it.
You are both bringing me down.
Hyde, why dont you just say you didnt take it?
I shouldnt have to say I didnt.
Look, just tell me you didnt, and Ill totally trust you.
You know whats a funny word?
Pickle weasel!
How bout I tell you this.
Go to hell, Forman!
Oh my god, Jackie should clog dance!
We cant lose!
Beauty pageant, here we come!
Oh, you ran out of gas, you idiot!
You forgot to get gas?
God, Jackie, someone had to hem your outfit for the clog dance!
Michael, I told you, Im not doing a clog dance!
God, your stupid van has ruined my life!
Your life?
What about my life?
What ABOUT your life?
?
Jackie, we are a team.
And part of being a team is that you have to do exactly what I tell you!
I mean, you know Jackie, there is no you in teamwork!
Oh, Jackie, youre upset.
Come, sit on my lap.
Ta-da!
Happy anniversary!
Oh my god!
Wow, theyre, theyre beautiful!
I got you something, too!
Here, open it!
Oh my god!
Its a watch!
And its all digital and stuff!
Oh, gee, look at that, you had it engraved.
What, you dont like it?
No, no, I love it, its just, man, you spent a lot of money on this.
Yeah, which means you better start putting out!
Ok, its kinda hard to be a tease if youre not playing along.
Donna, I was gonna get you something really great, but  Yeah, I heard about the crime spree in Candy Land.
Yeah.
Oh, you wanna see a picture of what I was gonna get you?
Sure.
You were gonna get me that?
Oh my god, thats so pretty.
What do you think, by Christmas maybe, if you save your money?
Donna!
Well, Eric, after seeing this, I mean, I hate these crappy flowers!
I know!
I didnt wanna give you crappy flowers!
Im kidding, Im kidding.
I love the flowers.
But you know maybe if I return that watch, I can get this for myself.
- Gimmie the watch back.
- No way!
Gimmie it!
- No, come and get it!
I dont know, Fez.
Maybe Michael was right.
Maybe I dont have what it takes to win a pageant by myself.
That is nonsense.
You are pretty, and nice, and talented, and sweet, and everything good in the whole world is you.
I know, I know, thats what I told Michael!
But then he said-- Who cares what Michael said?
He was using you for your beauty so he could become popular.
He makes me sick.
God.
I never thought of it that way.
Ok, Jackie?
Ive had some time to think.
And, uh, Im still disappointed in you.
But Im willing to talk about the whole thing.
Ok, stop.
Michael, stop.
Ive been talking to Fez, and I have only one thing to say to you.
I love you!
WHAT?
?
?
See, Michael, you must have really believed in me to think you could ride my coat tails to the top.
Baby!
Just get off me!
Both of you!
You make me sick!
Hey, what are you doing, Red?
I borrowed Erics Candy Land money to pay for the water heater.
You, uh, you took Erics money?
Shh!
He doesnt know a thing about it.
Its back now, hell be none the wiser!
Hey, hy!
How ya doing?
Look.
Hyde, I just got back from hanging out with Donna, and you know what, Hyde, I dont even care what happened to my money.
Cause, money doesnt make the world go round.
You know what does?
Screw you, you called me a thief.
Its love, thats right.
Love makes the world go round.
Well, thats great.
Because, Red took your money.
Right, Hyde, my dad took it.
Yeah.
Why dont you ask him, Forman?
Uh, dad, Hyde said you took my money?
Oh, yeah, I was a little short on the water heater.
Thanks for helping out!
Good news, buddy, youre cleared!
Why dont you get bent, man!
Wait a minute, you accused Steven of stealing your money?
Well, yeah, but to be fair, dad, thats before I found out you stole it.
Which, brings up why you didnt ask me, and, also, you know, you couldve told me.
Well, you couldve.
Ok.
Im sorry that I took some money out of your little box.
When I feed you, and clothe you, and put a roof over your head.
Soooorrrrry.
Now.
How could you do that to Steven?
Hes your best friend.
Well, he made a move on Donna.
Oh, come on!
Ok.
Well then, theres only one thing that we can do.
Nine rounds of bare knuckle boxing.
Come on.
Help me move the couch.
Wait, uh, dad, I dont No, no, no, no.
Ill referee.
Believe me, when its over, youll both feel great.
I know I will!
Red  Look!
If youre not mad enough to bare knuckle box then youre not mad.
Now both of you need to just get the hell over it!
Once again, Reds simple earthy wisdom saves the day.
Yeah, aint he a peach.
Look, Hyde.
I just  god, Im so sorry.
You know what, man?
You either forgive me for what happened with Donna, or you dont.
But you cant keep throwing that in my face.
Yeah, yeah, youre right.
Um, its over.
Im never gonna bring it up again, I promise.
Yeah, all right.
Whoa!
Man, she got you this watch and all you got her were those crappy flowers?
You loser!
You loser!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Look at this.
First day of deer season.
Rabbit season.
Duck season.
Rabbit season!
Duck season!
Wabbit season!
Duck season!
Well, Red, you havent been hunting in ages, not since the accident.
What accident?
A really terrible accident thats none of your business.
Oh, yeah, that one.
You know, why dont you go?
It might be fun, get out of the house, get some fresh air, maybe get out of your lousy damn mood!
Sorry.
Id love to go, Kitty, but  we just cant afford it.
Oh, yes we can.
I will pack you some food and a nice box of bullets and youre on your way!
Dad, you could use the Pinsciottis cabin.
Bob has a cabin?
Well, isnt that just the cats ass?
Oh, boo hoo, the worlds unfair.
Now just ask Bob if you can borrow his cabin.
Ok.
Well go.
Just us guys.
Uh, mom?
Well, you should go.
You dont spend nearly enough time with your father.
Thats because he doesnt like me.
Yes, he does like you.
And thats no excuse.
Well, I dont have a gun.
My mom took it when she left.
Well, you can share.
You know there is something about a gun that just makes you wanna share!
Ok, fine, mom, Ill go with dad, but if I dont come back  youll know who did it.
You know, hes never really warmed up to you.
Going on seventeen years now.
Ok, were going hunting!
Well, Yaaaaaay!
With Bob.
Oh.
Well, you know, maybe youll cheer up after you shoot something!
I always do!
Hey, Red.
Dont freak out, but if I see a deer on the side of the road, Im gonna shoot him!
Kelso, you fire that gun in this car, and I will pull over and kick your ass for an hour.
Do it, Red, do it!
Come on, Forman, would you get that gun away from him?
No!
I wanna hold it.
Give it up, Kelso.
I have a right to bear arms, all right?
Thats in the constitution!
Kelso, not everything in the constitution makes sense.
Whoa, Fez, shut up.
What did you say?
Uh, nothing?
Foreigners.
I hear ya.
So, so, so.
What to do.
I shoulda gone hunting.
No, no, no, we can have fun.
We can have our very own fun.
We could- Im not baking anything.
- Ohhhh!
Ok!
Who wants Jello?
Jellos baking.
No, no, no!
Jellos boiling!
Gotcha!
Hey, Red.
So, tell me about that hunting accident.
Sounds like a funny story.
Think well see any bears?
Id love to kill a bear.
You cant shoot a bear.
Its deer season!
You shoot a bear, you get fined, you go to jail.
No.
Ill just say it was self-defense.
Whos the jury gonna believe?
Me, or a dead bear?
Dead bear.
I killed a bear once.
Your ass.
I did!
I did.
I was getting a drink from a spring, see.
When suddenly, I heard something.
Grabbed my shotgun, boom.
Right between the eyes.
Survival.
So, whatd you do then?
You uh bring it home?
Get it stuffed?
Nope.
Left it there.
Went home.
How come you didnt bring it home?
Get it stuffed?
On account of it was so huge.
Oh.
So its a stand off.
I wont shave my legs, Bob wont shave his back.
Ok, eew.
You know, Red doesnt have a hairy back, can thank god for that.
No offense.
Good news for you, Donna!
That means Eric probably wont have one either.
He cant even grow a moustache.
Oh, please.
Erics body is bald as can be.
You know, I dont even think he hit puberty until about fifteen!
Really?
Oh, he probably wont like that I said that.
I think Erics the sweetest kid.
So, Donna.
Have you and Eric  Mother, please!
The answers no.
Hey, hey!
Everybody just shut up.
Well, I for one am not so naïve as to think that you and Eric- Aaaaahhhhhh!
!
!
Ok, well, I guess were upsetting her, so, what should we do now?
Well, if Donna wasnt so uptight, we could talk about- Im gonna go home.
You want me to go home?
Cause I will.
Donna, please dont go home.
I think its very nice that youre spending time with your mother.
God knows Laurie wont.
You guys, lets play poker!
I bet Im good at it!
You never played poker before?
Uh-uh.
But I have lots of money!
Oh, well, honey, have a seat!
Ill get the cards!
Oh my god  No!
Damn!
Damn, damn it all, damn!
Kelso!
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I would be proudly standing over my kill right now if someone hadnt taken my gun away.
Kelso, you cant fire the gun in the camp!
The deer walked right through here!
He was mine, I was gonna hunt him!
You know, Kelso, not every hunting accident is an accident.
Think you better sit this one out, pal.
Fine!
You know, I saw a deer blind on the way in, anybody wanna go check it out?
Ill go.
No, not me.
I just came to hang out.
When I crave meat, I buy baloney.
So wheres Fez?
Kelso probably shot him.
Oh, I saw him walking into the woods right after we got here.
Said he was going hunting.
He had a, a whistle and a stick!
Ah, crazy foreign bastard.
Lets eat!
Wow.
Those were some delicious birds.
Keychain?
Nah, Im good.
So you caught those birds with just a whistle and a stick?
Very impressive, Fez.
Yeah, you know, thats a good way to hunt.
Cause even if you dont get anything, you still have all the fun of a whistle and a stick.
Ill take the keychain.
Give it to Midge.
Little memento.
I feel good about that, Bob.
Midge is nice.
Yep.
We all like Midge.
Yeah, Midge has nice jugs.
What?
What?
No, you said something.
No I didnt.
So, whats up with your hair, huh?
Man, I am at one with nature right now.
Thanks for the pheasant, Fez.
Pheasant, Fez, pheasant, Fez  Yes.
Beautiful black pheasants.
Black pheasants.
Wait, pheasants arent black.
Well, black is beautiful.
I wish Jackie were black.
What did you feed us, Fez?
They were pheasants!
They went, Cu caw!
Cu caw!
You fed us a crow?
Youre not supposed to eat a crow, man!
You just brought some bad juju on us all!
We ate somebodys soul, man!
Aye, no.
I have eaten someones delicious soul.
Hey, good news, guys, I found my gun!
What?
Its probably not loaded.
Oh, wow, mom, youre not good.
Well, youre not even playing, so keep it to yourself, Miss Smarty.
Ok, Ill play.
You wanna play cards with your mother?
Sure!
Well I am gonna call the Milwaukee Journal!
Kitty?
How many kings are in a pack?
Four.
I bet a dollar.
Well, um.
I see that there are four queens in a deck, too.
Oh, mom, that is so pathetic.
Fine, I fold.
Im in.
Ok, uh, do you want any cards?
Yeah.
Can I have two fives please?
And Ill have one card.
Oh, its five.
Jackie, did you want this?
You gave her a five?
I thought we were friends!
Ok!
You know what?
Everybody just show your cards.
Ok.
Did I win?
Did I win?
Did I win?
Not even close.
Oh.
Well, I dont care.
I dont work, so money doesnt really mean anything to me.
Oh, how nice for you.
Hey, dad, I dont know about you but Im kinda frozen to the blind.
Right in the pants area.
Shh!
Geez, you have done nothing but complain since we got here.
You know, I was hoping that this trip would be better than the lastwhere you cried about every stupid thing.
I was six.
And you made me touch a dead rabbit!
I just thought that if you touched it, you might not be afraid of it.
Well, thank you, Dr. Spock.
Making noise is not the way to bag a deer.
Had nightmares for a month.
Big, dead rabbit nightmares.
Oh man!
We got one!
He is huge!
Where?
I dont see it!
Its about a quarter click south of the clearing.
What is a click?
And which way is south?
Oh, no, wait, ok, I see him!
Yeah!
Oh, youre right dad, he is huge!
Youre not kidding.
Id say hes a ten pointer!
What?
I was just thinking.
You take the shot.
N-no way!
You always talk about getting a buck.
You do it.
No, damn it, now dont argue with me, now take the shot!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Oh, and dont shoot him in the face!
Holy cow, look at him go.
Man, you really stink.
I told you to take the shot.
I just thought it would be nice for you to get a deer, I mean, god knows Id love to get one.
Then you should have taken the shot!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Why are you always so damn nervous?
Oh, hmm, I dont know, maybe its because youve been yelling at me for seventeen years?
Oh, I have not.
Oh, god, he was right there!
I, I coulda hit him with a rock!
Yep, thats a damn shame.
So you ready to head back?
No, I sure as hell am not ready to head back.
You wanna go back?
You go back.
So, hey dad, how bout a war story?
Yeah, ok.
I ever tell you about the time I didnt miss that North Korean?
Full house, jacks over tens!
Mom wins again!
Well, this is fun!
Isnt this fun?
It was fun til Laurie started dealing.
Hey, whats that supposed to mean?
Oh my gosh!
I think Mrs. Pinsciottis saying that Lauries cheating!
No, shes not.
Wait!
Yes I am.
My daughter does not cheat.
Come on, Donna.
Were storming out of here.
Ok, see ya!
Hold on, Ill storm with you!
Thank you for a lovely afternoon, Mrs. Forman!
Laurie, were you cheating?
You cant prove anything.
Oh, for gods sake!
Ok.
Well, if you werent such a crappy card player then I wouldnt have had to cheat!
And you were gonna lose all your mad money, and Midge bugs me.
You were cheating so I would win.
Duh!
I wanted you to have a little fun.
Well gosh, thats sweet.
Yeah.
I love you, mommy!
I just know I wouldnt have missed him.
Not when he was that close.
No way.
Here.
Dad, you see the can by that clearing?
Yeah!
I dont believe it.
Howd you do that?
Dad.
I know how to shoot.
Dont you remember my taxi driver phase?
Look, I didnt wanna kill him!
I missed on purpose.
Well, I can respect that more than you being a crappy shot.
What?
Why didnt you say so?
Why do you think?
You really think Ive been yelling at you for seventeen years?
No.
You were probably ok with me as an infant, I just cant remember.
Boy, it was right around thirteen when you started getting a little lippy.
And twitchy.
Well, you know, lippy and twitchy tend to walk hand in hand, so  Now thats lippy.
You got something you wanna say to me, you just say it.
Dad  No, Im, Im serious.
Just for a second, pretend that Im not your dad.
I want you to tell me what you really think of me.
How bout lets do this when you dont have a gun?
How bout you do what the guy with the gun tells you to do?
Okay.
I think youre angry, because life didnt turn out exactly the way that you wanted it to.
And, uh, maybe you think if you yell at me, I wont let life push me around, too.
You came up with that answer awful fast.
Well.
Hell, Eric.
Maybe youll be ok.
Oh, my god.
Dad, hes back.
Oh, look at him, hes magnificent!
Hes the king of the forest.
Just like  Bambis dad.
Hes beautiful.
Yeah, and I bet he tastes beautiful, too.
Oh, uh, just for the record, Eric.
Im the king of the forest.
Way to go, dad.
You finally got your buck.
Wish it was mine!
But somebody took my gun away cause he sensed what a great hunter I am!
Kelso, if we let you keep your gun, Fezd be the one strapped to that hood right now.
Hey, Red!
So, uh, about that accident, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, it was a long time ago.
I was out, uh, hunting with Frank.
He was a good friend of mine.
A good guy.
Kind of a dumbass, like, uh, Kelso here.
So anyway, Frank shot this deer.
And he was real happy.
And hed had a few beers, so he was dancing around, and it was all real fun.
And then, he leans over to kiss the deer.
Only the deers not dead yet and it kicks him right in the neck!
And it killed him.
The deer is staring at my soul.
Put some sunglasses on it!
Well, this is just delicious!
Sorry about the buckshot.
Oh, I dont mind.
I mean, theres usually some mystery gristle in meat and at least we know what it is.
I like it better when you fish, daddy.
It was jerking around, so, uh, Eric shot it with a shot gun.
Well, I had to.
It was screaming.
Killed a raccon once Hit him with my uncle's car so bad.
Allright, settle down killer.
Yeah, says like we're all a bunch of real killers.
Oh, good God crack the window Bloody some blessings
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
So!
Lets get to the lovin, huh?
So, how bout a little mood music, huh?
Zepplin or Foghat?
Whatever.
Laurie, are you ok?
Im sorry, I guess Im just not into it today.
Actually, I feel like talking.
Oh!
Yeah, ok, yeah, Ill try anything once.
Well, its just lately, I feel like all my friends are away at school and Im the only one here, and I just feel like this huge failure!
Laurie!
Dont be silly.
Failures are ugly and youre hot!
Thats true!
Yeah!
Thanks, Kelso!
Yeah.
I guess it all started in Jr. High.
Thats when a girl really defines who she is.
You know what I mean?
So were talking some more?
I really wanna talk.
Ok.
Guess Ill put my shirt back on so we can talk some more.
Great!
Yeah, super.
Look at this ad, Red.
Theyre opening a Price Mart right in our own town.
Fourteen ninety-five for a toaster.
Can ya believe it?
No, I cant.
I bought that very same toaster in your store for twice that.
Yeah, thats my point.
That you screwed me?
Red, fourteen ninety-five is below my cost.
This Price Mart could put me out of business.
Hey, theyre hiring!
Red, you cant.
These giant corporations come into town, they destroy little businesses like mine.
Theyre evil.
Yeah, I guess thats true  Where is the food?
Eric, you should give your refrigerator to people who have food.
Look at this.
Hamburger Helper.
Tuna Helper.
A can of beets?
Oh, gross, I will not eat a darn beet.
You know what, Forman, your dad better get a job, and soon.
Because Im starving here.
Ill tell him you said that.
Michael, its not polite to remind poor people that theyre po- less fortunate.
Were not less fortunate.
Were just on a budget.
Well, it is a hell of a tiny budget!
Oh, thats not funny, thats sad.
Hey, Kelso, eat that.
All right, green Jell-O.
Hey, Jackie, try some.
I heard green stuff makes you horny.
Michael, that only works with green M + Ms, duh!
Nuh-uh!
Its everything green!
Right, Donna?
Actually, Kelso.
You know what really makes you horny?
Beets.
Yeah, right.
Nah, its true, I saw it on Sixty Minutes, man.
Beet farmers with like, ten, fifteen kids.
Man, hows come everything thats good for you always tastes so bad?
Im trying it!
Michael, honey, dont eat our beets!
You know, Michael, Mrs. Formans right.
Youre horny enough as it is.
Sometimes, I wish you had two girlfriends.
Oh my god, are you serious?
- What?
- Nothing!
I get it, Bob!
Kitty, Im getting a job at Price Mart!
And I guess, Ive just been too concerned with the needs of others and I havent thought enough about myself.
Kelso?
Yeah, yeah!
Listening.
So, what do you think?
Well, uh I  agree?
Really?
Yeah!
I mean, everything you said makes so much sense!
So, who wants sex, I know I do!
Kelso, Im feeling really close to you.
Um  I think I want a relationship!
Yes.
Thats what I want!
A sexual relationship.
NO, no, I mean, I want more from you than just sex.
Dont be silly, Laurie, sex is enough for any woman.
Kelso, I want an emotional relationship.
Exactly!
We both want a sexually emotional relationship!
This Price Mart looks like a heck of an outfit, Kitty!
Yeah, maybe I should go down there and get a job, too.
Eric, when your fathers in a good mood, what do I say?
- No talking?
- Thank you!
Eric, Ive told you.
Your job is to study hard, get good grades, get a scholarship, go to college and move away!
End of discussion!
Then how come Hyde gets to have a job?
Because, Forman.
You have potential.
- Whereas Ill be a success if I stay out of jail.
- Exactly!
Oh, no, Steven, that is not true!
Its just, its a little different because he doesnt have any parents!
Oh my god, I dont have any parents?
Ok, ok!
Wish me luck.
- Ok, good luck, honey!
Knock em dead!
- Good Luck Man, whats his problem?
I just I just wanna help out.
Well, I am sorry, Eric, but I agree with your father.
School is your job.
Oh, and also to be my precious little baby boy!
Mom!
We talked about this.
Im not a boy any more.
Im a man.
Shut up, Hyde!
I am a man!
Fine.
My precious little baby man!
Oh, man.
You are so lucky your moms a run away alcoholic.
Ted: I must say, Red, I am very impressed with your experience.
Well, thank you, Mr. Herbeson!
Ted: Oh, call me Ted, Red.
Hey, Ted, Red, thats funny.
Yeah, it is, uh, I didnt catch it there at first, but then, woop!
Thats funny!
Ted: I see youre applying for our supervisor position, what would you say if I offered you a job right now?
Id say lets break out the champale!
Ted: Great, cause were hiring cashiers.
You get your own smock.
But Im not a cashier, Ted.
Im management.
Ted: Ok!
Then well let you know.
So, uh Red, Ted, thats pretty funny though!
Ted: On second thought, its not that funny.
- Red, come and eat your dinner!
- Shh!
Not hungry.
Hey, whats going on?
Shh!
Reds waiting for a phone call.
Oh.
Shh!
Sorry!
You know, that phone hasnt rung all damn day!
Maybe its broken.
No, its not broken!
No, its not broken.
Oh!
Damn!
They could have called right then, got a busy signal, moved on to the next guy on the list, oh, man!
I just screwed myself out of a job!
Wait, Red, wait!
Let it ring.
You dont wanna seem desperate.
Right.
Eric, if this is one of your dumbass friends, you better start running!
Please dont be Kelso, please dont be Kelso.
Hello?
Its Price Mart!
Yes!
This is the Forman residence!
You have good news!
Yeah-huh!
Uh-huh!
Ok, then.
Thanks for calling.
So whats the good news?
Well.
The good news is  Eric got a job at Price Mart.
Run, honey, run!
Man, Red went ballistic on me!
I mean, I wanna keep the job, but  I really dont wanna wear my ass for a hat.
Cause you know, he said he could do that and I believe him.
Come on, Forman.
Fight the power, man!
That way I can have your room after Red kills you.
Although Im not sure an ass hat is fatal.
You know what would be a good job for me?
Gigolo.
The loving is over.
Now, pay me!
So, Lauries been talking a lot lately, right?
Shes saying she wants a relationship.
You know, and I kept waiting for the dirty part But the dirty part never came.
Kelso, I have a real problem here, ok?
Id like to talk about that.
Right.
You know, dating two girls wasnt supposed to be like this!
It was supposed to be like  So, do you wanna talk?
No way!
I just wanna fool around!
Yes!
Talking is stupid!
You know, Ill just wait quietly til you and Laurie are done.
Have fun!
Well, thanks, babe.
You know, feel free to jump in.
Kelso, you mind if I join in your sexy circle too?
Why not?
All Eric ever wants to do is talk.
I told you he was a loser.
I know!
I mean, how am I supposed to talk when I dont have a thought in my pretty little red head?
See, Michael?
Donnas just as empty headed as we are!
Oh, Donna, you make a great addition to our sexy circle.
All right, ladies, theres just one rule here.
There are no bras allowed.
The girls: YAY!
See, thats pretty sweet, huh?
What do you think?
I think it makes your ass look big.
You know, I just dont know why my dad doesnt want me to work.
I mean, yeah, Im a real bad boy, Donna.
My big teenage rebellion is to get a job.
Oooh, you never know what Im gonna do next.
Oh my god, look out!
Hes got insurance!
You know, I think itll be great when you get a job.
Maybe on our dates we wont just have to sit in the car, maybe we can actually drive some where and maybe, I dont know, eat?
Or maybe I can get my own popcorn at the movies!
Youre a dreamer.
Yeah, you know what?
Im gonna keep the job.
Well, youre like a rebel without a cause.
But with a cause.
- And a smock.
- Right!
You gotta hide me!
Kelso!
Are you down there?
Crap!
Im not here!
Have you seen Kelso?
- Why, yes I have!
Hes hiding from you in the shower!
- Ah!
Hi!
Guess what?
I just found my eighth grade diary!
Come on, Ill read it to you!
Great!
Hey, Forman!
Good news, Red.
I just took Cosmos ten ways to please your man in bed test, and I got nine out of ten!
But I didnt get number three because Im a nurse and number three is icky.
I cant believe that Eric.
Oh, I think working is important to Erics self-esteem, and I really dont think its a big deal.
But he only got a job, Kitty, because I dont have one!
And no son of mine is gonna work and screw up his chances to go to college because I cant carry the load.
I should have taken that crummy cashiers job.
Oh, now, what kind of talk is that?
You deserve to be supervisor.
In fact, the Red Forman I know would march right down there and fight for it.
Ive been out of work for six months, I cant afford to fight right now, Kitty!
I gotta take their crappy offer, and smile like a jackass while I do it.
Red, I dont think your smile is gonna- Oh, Im going for a walk.
Well, wait a minute, honey!
You know what, we can split a bottle of wine and Ill, Ill give number three a shot!
That was a close one!
Did you quit that job?
Dad, I wanna keep that job.
Well, its a tough world, Eric, and people dont always get what they want.
Especially you.
Dad, Im pretty sure Im not backing down on this one.
Youre not?
Oh, no.
Well, I guess you win, then.
Dad, you always tell me never to back down.
Dont back down.
Formans never back down.
And now youre telling me to back down?
Well, Dad, I can only conclude that youre insane!
You think thats funny?
Well, you know, maybe not in the traditional ha ha sense, but  Look, I gotta go.
You know, youre gonna look real funny when youre wearing- Your ass for a hat.
Even though I doubt thats physically possible.
Lets find out together.
Ok.
Laurie.
I want you to know that I really, really, really enjoy fooling around with you.
Yeah, I get that a lot.
And you should!
Cause youre talented!
See, but I dont want one of those relationships because I already have one of those with Jackie.
Yeah, but that cant last!
No.
See, what Im saying is, is that we have to break this thing off.
Huh.
Thats a pretty big decision to make all on your own.
Maybe you and me and Jackie should all get together and discuss it!
No.
You wouldnt.
Really?
Look at me, Kelso.
Look into my eyes.
Laurie?
Will you go out with me?
Oh, Kelso, I thought youd never ask!
Ted: A smart move taking cashier.
Know you were gunning for supervisor, but, hey.
Theres no shame in backing down.
Well, that is a mighty nice smock.
You know, you think that your kids dont listen to you.
But they do.
Ted: Not sure I follow.
I changed my mind, Ted.
Im here for the supervisors job.
Know what I mean?
Ted?
Ok, well, now.
Your father should be back from his interview any minute now.
Mom, how come we have to be here?
I could be using this time to  not be here.
No, this is a very difficult day for your father and he needs to be with his family.
- Ill be in the basement.
- No, you sit!
Oh, sure, when things get ugly, suddenly Im family!
Not to me, freak.
You are so going to end up in porno!
Hi honey!
Right to the bar.
Not a good sign.
What are you all looking at?
Dont you think that  Price Marts new supervisor deserves a drink?
Yay!
Yeah, I got it!
Hey, congratulations, Dad.
Thanks, Eric.
Oh!
And youre fired.
What, you cant do that!
Yes I can!
Youre fired!
Hey, you know what?
Im not fired.
Ok, if its so important to you, youre not fired.
But if your grades start to slip, you are fired!
I love saying that!
God help the poor bastards who work for you, huh?
Wait, uh, I work for you.
I know!
So Dad!
You and me going to work together.
What a nightmare, huh?
Oh, would you look at that.
They spelled your name wrong!
Just doesnt get old, does it?
Well, if it isnt Benedict and Arnold.
Bob, I needed that job.
And if you cant get that, well Im sorry, youre a dumbass.
- Look, they misspelled Price Mart!
- You wanna keep that finger?
Uh-huh.
You gotta stop goofing around, Kelso.
Am I right, Jackie?
Laurie is so right, Michael.
We are very disappointed in you.
Even Eric got a job.
Yeah, even my stupid brother got a job.
Yeah, her brothers stupid and he got a job.
- Sexy circle?
- Ow!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Oh Reruns not smart.
Whats Happening?
Ill tell you whats happeninghilarity.
Yeah no kidding.
Hey Hey Hey!
 Thats just funny man.
Hey, hey can you guys keep it down a bit please?
Hyde theres lipstick on your chin.
Hyde, why are you putting lipstick on your chin?
Its for your lips.
Hey, maybe hes got a girl back there.
So Hyde, whos the lucky lady?
I never kiss and tell.
Its Kat Peterson.
Yeah right, youre in your bedroom with the most popular girl in school.
Yeah, what happened to Farrah Fawcett?
Did her car break down?
Look, just keep it down alright?
Youre killing the mood.
Hyde theres no mood because theres no one back there.
Hey Michael.
Ok so were all set for our big dinner party!
Oh yea, the big dinner party.
So here  You and a guest are cordially invited for an evening of cocktails, dinner, and TV.
 The attire is semi-formal-casual.
Ah, finally I can wear my tuxedo T-shirt.
Uh sorry Fez, I forgot to invite you and Hyde.
Oh, but its never too late.
Ok bye!
Dont worry Fez, Im sure you and Hyde can come.
No Michael, they cant.
Ok, I get it.
They cant come.
Come with me.
Nooo!
!
Ok, Ill give you a hundred bucks if you dont make me go to this party.
- Show me the hundred.
- Damn!
!
Well, the partys tomorrow night so I better go home and start putting on cologne now.
So, that was fun.
No, Disneyland is fun, that was nasty.
Oh my god Hyde, Kat Peterson, nice.
Yup, shes slumin it, Im lovin it.
Red, Honey, would you go to Bob and Midges and get my casserole dish?
Im making Tuna Surprise tonight.
Well now that I know, youve ruined the surprise.
Its for Scrabble night.
Bob and Midge love Tuna Surprise.
Yeah, but I dont love Bob and Midge.
Well Red I have to keep inviting them over, they keep inviting us.
Thats because you keep inviting them.
Somebodys got to break the chain or itll go on forever.
Red, theyre the only friends we have since you made Phyllis cry.
I didnt say anything about Phyllis weight that the whole room didnt already know.
Donna, Im going to have dinner parties all the time when Im Mrs. Michael Kelso, Esquire.
Just think about it.
- Do it have to?
- Oh shhh ..
So theres sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight and your eyes are blue  Theyre brown.
I know.
Oh Kelso, you little so and so.
Id nary a notion of your songbird ways, having thought you merely a captain of industry and a king among men.
Eric, cease your fawning and let us discuss the fox hunt.
But first, I crave a French pastry, wheres the help?
Apologies good sire, I was in the stables brushing the horses, secretly entertaining the notion of a sensual tryst with a lady.
Top drawer!
Top drawer!
top drawer ..
Hello?
?
Oh, hey Bob.
Oh, hi Red.
Stop it!
You know what might make this party a little more fun?
Sweet death.
Hyde!
Fez!
MICHAEL!
!
Oh good, its Hyde, Fez, and Michael.
Hello fellas, whats to eat?
Are these melon balls for anyone?
Why are they here?
I invited them because youre always discussing manners and I wanted to be mannerly.
Hes mannerly.
Hey Chuck!
Oh no, Chucks here.
Why?
Why Michael?
Why would invite all these people?
Why would you do this?
Well, I was thinking that if a party with 10 people was fun, then a party with 30 people would be twice as much fun.
Michael, I didnt want twice as much fun, I wanted a small, classy party.
Jackie, just because theres a couple more people doesnt mean it cant still be classy.
Hey everybody, Im taking off my pants!
!
No hair?
None well, a little.
Well what are we talking about here Red?
Is it Ed Asner bald or Charlie Brown bald?
Geez Kitty, I dont know.
I barely looked.
Ok I need a visual aid.
It was so uncomfortable.
I mean, a toupee is a pretty big lie, Kitty.
Ok here, show me on Wooly Willy.
Uh huh, ok, uh huh Really?
?
Hey, hey, would it kill you to use a coaster?
Bunch of wild hooligans here.
Oh, sorry Red.
Well, you know, it was gonna leave a ring.
Thats so true Kitty.
Eric, look this isnt your house.
You arent going to get in trouble for any of this so loosen up.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.
Oh my god, its like Im seeing colors Ive never seen before.
Hey Kat, want a beer?
No thanks She just blew me off man?
Do you believe that?
Yes I do.
I really, really do.
Michael, are they drinking out of my parents crystal?
Yeah Jackie, they were trying to drink straight from the bottle and I said No, no, use the crystal, cause its classy.
 Michael Im going to go upstairs and feel sorry for myself and you, you are gonna fix this.
Fix it?
Jackie, youre having the party of the year here.
Damn, I do not get women!
Yes, neither does Hyde, right Hyde?
You ok?
Donna please, I really dont want to talk about Michael.
Ok, so what is your honest opinion about Michael?
Umm, by honest you mean  Donna, please learn to listen.
Ok fine, honestly, you have certain expectations of Kelso that may not be entirely realistic.
You want him to be sophisticated and smart, but actually hes unsophisticated and unsmart.
RANDOM  Hey you guys are really bringing down the make out room.
Well, Im gonna have to pass, Ive got nothing.
Would you look at her Fez, acting like shes hot stuff?
So shes really good looking and everyone likes her, Im real impressed.
Yeah, I know how it is.
You think you know somebody, but then it turns out he lied about making out with Kat Peterson.
Hyde!
Fez!
What is this a funeral?
Why arent you guys getting down?
Well my friend, Hyde is way too lovesick to get down.
Love sick?
I dont love her man.
I just think we should be having sex and all because shed enjoy it.
Hyde, Im not a doctor, but I play one on TV.
But seriously Hyde, this is a party, so loosen up  Like me, whoopsie daisy!
Man, I wish Jackie would loosen up.
Shes throwing a great party down here and shes missing it.
Kelso you dont get it, huh?
This party meant the world to Jackie and you crapped on it.
Alright, ease up on Kelso, huh?
Thanks Hyde.
Yeah, so you did something horrible, but its Jackie, so who cares?
No wait, what are you saying?
Im saying you burned her man, royally.
Nice job.
But no, man, I didnt want to burn her.
I invited all these people to make it fun, so the party would be good.
She didnt want a good party, she wanted her party.
You know what?
Youre right Fez.
Alright, this partys over.
Everybody out!
No, Kelso, what are you saying man?
Think!
You know what guys?
For the first time in my life, I think I am thinking.
You know Im in danger of ruining the greatest thing thats ever happened to me and I am not going to let that happen.
Kelso  Do not interrupt me, this is important!
From now on, Im going to put Jackies needs first and shes going to be so proud of me!
Whoa!
WHOA MAN, THIS IS A RAGER!
Give me your brandies.
WHOA!
WHOA!
WHOA!
God, how dare you say that about me and Michael!
?
Jackie, you wanted my honest opinion.
Your honest opinion that were great together.
Look, you were wrong about Michael.
He knows he made a mistake and hes going to make it up to me.
You wait and see.
Uh Jackie, wheres the fire extinguisher?
S-I-T.
Thats sit.
 Oh my, yes it is again.
Yeah, Midge has got quite a lead.
Your turn Red.
Ok fine.
Cue ball Im sorry Bob, I uh .
Sorry?
Why apologize to me?
I like billiards.
Billiards are fun.
Ok, so you all know.
I dont know anything.
I wear a toupee.
Bob!
If you tell them, theyll know!
I wear a rug, so what?
You know ..
I wish I had a toupee.
You know, because you know, the way my hair is sometimes.
Look Bob, being isnt something a man has to hide from.
A toupee is just silly.
I keep telling him that if he grew as much hair on his head as he does on his back, hed have a full head of hair!
I know its silly, I guess Im vain.
Every morning I wake up wishing I had the courage to walk around looking like you.
But I dont, Red.
I dont.
I guess that makes me a bad person.
Look Bob, I didnt mean to make you .
No, no, you know what?
Youre right Red, youre right.
Maybe its time I stop living the lie.
Sinuses.
Alright, alright.
I was wrong, you need the toupee.
Put it back on.
Hey, hey Donna, I wanna sing to you, hey hey hey Donna, no one else will ever do, Ive waited so long for school to be through, Donna, Donna, I love you hey hey Donna!
!
 Eric, get down off there right now!
Whats the problem Donna?
Yeah, whats the problem Donna?
Timmy, go get your pants on or Ill beat the crap out of you!
Eric, remember when I told you to loosen up?
Oh yeah baby.
Well, tighten up baby.
When the house is on fire, the partys over.
Well, hey, this was your idea.
Eric, I told you to loosen up, not act like a dink.
Well Im new at this so sue me.
Sue, sue, sue me!
!
Sue me Donna!
Eric!
Hello Steven.
Oh, I see how this is gonna be.
So when youre with your little clique, youre too good for me.
Right, but theyre gone now, so .
hi.
You know, for a rich girl, youre kind of skanky.
Come on, let me show you the garage.
That proves nothing!
Son of a bitch.
Wait Jackie, I owe you an apology.
I just wanted to help tonight and I guess I blew it.
Im sorry.
Yeah, lately youve been sorry a lot Michael.
Yeah, but this time I mean it.
Actually, he does.
He felt very bad and said tender words about you and then, he set your house on fire.
See he loves you, but hes just, hes just stupid.
- Thank you Fez.
- Sure.
Jackie, I do love you and Ill do whatever it takes to make you happy with me.
Yeah, well Im beginning to think that youre never going to make me happy.
What are you saying?
Im saying I have a lot of thinking to do.
Whoo, dodged a bullet there, huh Fez?
Nothing good came out of this night, although I did find out that brandys flammable.
Yeah, thats worth knowing.
Oh and uh, gasoline for future reference.
I just dont get chicks, man.
God Donna, men are stupid.
How can they not know what we want?
I think they know what we want, but they just wont give it to us.
You know?
Its so simple.
Yeah, its confusing, huh?
Oh my god, the most horrifying moment, Eric sang to me.
Hey, I sang to Donna.
Yeah, she kinda melted.
I mean, she called me a dink, but I dont think she meant it.
Eric was such a dink tonight.
And I mean it.
Totally.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ok, here we go.
Right hand blue.
Fez, you can't play Twister by yourself.
That's where you're wrong, my friend.
Right leg green.
Oh, that's gonna be tough.
Hey, Fez, man.
The circus called.
They said they'd pay you fifty bucks a week if you can kiss your own ass.
Take a message.
I have the greatest news in the world.
How the hell are you doing that?
I'm double jointed.
Super.
My parents are renewing their wedding vows.
Wait, so, double dating degenerates and skeezy bar hags just lost its appeal?
You'd be amazed how fast skeezy bar hags lose their appeal.
But then like, two beers later it all comes roaring back!
No, finally the insanity's over!
And now I'm, I'm really happy about this, Eric, and you should be, too.
My parents have been driving me nuts and I've probably been a little moody lately.
No, god, you haven't been moody.
Oh, this is great.
Jackie's gonna get wedding fever.
Man, all I'm gonna hear is, "Michael, at our wedding don't shove cake in my face".
And, "You better know how to dance".
And, "There will not be a trampoline".
A wedding without a trampoline.
That's crazy talk.
Yeah, it'd be like a funeral without a dunk tank.
Kay, she even knows what kind of china pattern she wants.
Pink and purple with unicorns.
Who wants to see a unicorn when they're eating pie?
Left leg yellow.
- Will someone please help me get my pants off?
- NO!
Are you sure you have to help your parents with their wedding vows?
Yes!
Quit it.
I got a vow.
I vow to kiss you so hard your pretty little red head pops off.
No, I could really make that happen!
Quit it!
Donna, I'm sorry.
Pinning me only makes it sexier.
Hey, kids.
Hey, Donna, get off of me!
Hello.
So, uh, what's up?
Well, your mom and I have been talking, we have a few ideas about the vows.
First of all, a wedding is a nice way to spend the day.
Write that down.
Spending the day with your mom is nice.
That's my first vow.
I don't think that's a vow.
Yes, it is.
Ok, uh, mom.
Why do you wanna get remarried?
Well, when your dad an I were in the attic, we figured out I still fit in my wedding dress!
That's good, too.
Midge, you're as thin today as the day I married you.
That's a nice vow.
Write!
So the ceremony and reception will be completely green and gold.
In honor of the Packers.
That's classy, Bob.
And Red, since you and I have a special bond, I'd like you to be my best man.
Really?
Yep.
Well, I, I don't know, Bob.
Oh, I think that is just lovely.
Yeah, fine, uh, I'd love to be your best man.
And Kitty, since you and Midge are so close, she'd like to ask you a special favor.
Oh, Bob!
I would be honored to be Midge's- She'd like you to bring chairs.
-- chair bringer.
Oh, Steven!
How'd you like to be our wedding photographer?
Nope!
I like to party at parties.
I'll give you ten bucks.
Twenty plus a meatball sub.
- Deal.
- Deal.
Well, gotta go pick up my green and gold tux.
It's a special order.
Guy looked at me like I was an idiot.
Yeah.
That was the look.
Well, can you beat that.
Midge and I are much better friends than you and Bob.
Well, men's friendships- All of my life I have wanted to be a bridesmaid.
None of my friends have ever asked me to be a bridesmaid.
Well, that's 'cause you're too pretty.
Oh, can it.
That's not gonna work.
I am gonna be a bridesmaid.
Hey.
Wanna be the best man?
Leo: I'm sorry, man, I must've lost your film.
Are you sure it was this hut?
Hey man.
All right, check this out, ok?
A friend of mine's having a wedding this weekend.
And I told him that I'd be the photographer.
Leo: Whoa, cool, man.
I remember my wedding, it was magical, man.
Chicks and booze everywhere.
And I'd be willing to miss all that chicky boozy fun to take pictures, you know.
But Leo, man, I got a problem.
I can't see through the viewfinder, because I have a glass eye.
Leo: How come your eye doesn't look like glass, man?
Well that's 'cause it's special space age glass.
Leo: Whoa, your eye was in space?
That's awesome, man!
Ok.
So here's the deal, all right.
Job pays ten bucks, and half a meatball sub.
So I'm missing out on a pretty sweet deal, here.
Damn you, glass eye.
Leo: Well, hey, I could use the ten bucks, man.
And half a meatball sub.
If only I had a camera.
Leo: Whoa!
Hey, it's all coming together, man!
Why do we have to get all dressed up for the stupid rehearsal dinner?
Because my mom said so.
And we don't argue with mommy.
Ok.
So Jackie hasn't made me read a single bride's magazine.
I tell you, man, ever since I set her house on fire she's been acting really weird.
Hey, you know, uh, when I'm trying to get in good with Donna, you know what works for me?
I don't set her house on fire!
Oh, sure.
Eyesight's twenty twenty.
Here, loser, mom wants you to put this on.
Hey, Laurie.
Where have you been, you idiot?
Oh, well, Jackie was  I told you never to say that name to me.
We have a relationship!
That's true, so  Shut up.
Jackie.
Hear me now.
I am not helping with any of the wedding stuff.
Good.
Oh, nice try, Jackie, but the reverse psychology's not gonna work on me.
My mind's too powerful.
Whatever.
Ok.
No, wait, Jackie, that's confusing!
I'm not chasing after you!
Oh, Kitty!
Would you like to meet the bridesmaids?
Oh, Bob, would I like to be a bridesmaid?
No, would you like to meet the bridesmaids.
- Oh.
Whatever.
Fine.
- Good Uh, Kitty, this is Barbara, Honor, and Holly.
Hi.
Holly's the maid of honor.
Holly: Which is ironic, that Honor is not the maid of honor.
Honor: I am so gonna get you.
Holly: Shut up.
Barbara: For god's sake, don't do this now.
Holly and Honor: You shut up!
Barbara: I didn't fly in from Istanbul for this!
Well, um, well, that is, is just a lovely dress.
Where do the batteries go?
Ha, ha!
Peace out!
Ha ha!
Ok, Red, you're the best man, you make the toast.
I would, but, I'm not from Istanbul.
Oh, fine.
Ahem.
'Scuse me.
Hello!
Listen up you bastards!
Um, sorry about the uh, the bastards thing.
Anyway, I'd like to make a special toast to two very special people, Bob and Midge.
Everyone: Awww!
Bob and Midge.
Bobby, and Midgey!
Here's to Bob and Midge!
Everyone: Awww!
Red, that was a lovely toast.
Well, thanks.
Kitty, I have another big favor to ask.
Uh-huh?
At the ceremony, I'm wearing something old, something new, something borrowed, and I wondered if you had something blue I could borrow?
No, but I have something sharp and rusty I'd love to give you.
Um, dad, can I talk to you for a second?
I've been trying to work what we talked about into your vows, but I'm having a little trouble.
You put in that thing about your mom staying thin?
Yeah.
So what's the problem?
Well, dad, it just doesn't seem very  Hey, there's nothing in there about me being thin, is there?
'Cause I can't get enough of these weenies.
I can't believe this!
Hey, good lookin'!
Have a cocktail weenie?
Leave me alone.
What, that's not a metaphor!
Look, cocktail weenies!
My god, can you believe it?
I know, it's unbelievable!
These are wedding vows, Eric.
Vows.
They're supposed to mean something!
Well, yeah, that's what I said, and I was told to shut up!
Shut up.
What is this?
Scotch and soda.
Blegh!
That's not scotch!
You're right!
It's a Shirley Temple.
I just didn't wanna say that 'cause it sounded like something Chris McNickel would drink, so  God!
Their marriage almost ended, they put me through hell, and now that they're getting back together, it's like it doesn't even mean anything!
How am I supposed to write about love when they are the worst example in the entire world?
No, no, okay, look, they may not be the best example but, they do love each other.
They just can't express it or, really any thoughts more complex than I'm hungry.
But the important thing is that they really do love each other.
Yeah, I guess they do.
They do, you know they do.
And that's why they need you to say what they can't say.
Because, despite your bimbo-like good looks, you're very smart.
Look, write the vows that you would write.
And Donna, I know  I know it'll be great.
Ok.
Thanks.
Oh, hey!
Fez!
Uh, if anybody asks, this is a glass eye.
What?
Hey!
Leo, man!
You all set?
Leo: Totally, man, I got everything.
Great!
Where's the camera?
Leo: I got everything but the camera.
Or the film.
Or the flash cubes.
Heh.
I got nothing, man.
Leo, man, the photo hut is loaded with that stuff.
Leo: I know, it's ironic, isn't it?
And yet, not surprising.
Leo: Hey, I'm Leo.
And I'm also a Leo.
Think about it.
Holly: Yeah, wow!
I'm Holly, and I think that's deep.
Whatever.
All right, Jackie.
If you're mad at me, well then use your mad voice.
And if you're not, well then lady, you better start chewing my ear off like usual!
Look, Michael.
I'm not mad, ok?
Ghah!
Could you be any more annoying?
Yes!
Oh, Kitty, it's a disaster!
The ceremony's starting and I can't find Holly!
Well, I'm sure she's here somewhere.
I bet if we listen real hard we can hear her dress!
Ha ha ha!
All right, sweetie, I'll help you look.
Holly!
Holly: Have you ever seen a girl do this before?
Leo: Uh, once in Amsterdam.
I love photography, man.
Oh my.
Midge?
Sweetie, now, I just, um, I just, I don't have a good feeling about this.
What am I gonna do?
Well, you don't worry about that.
You go back inside.
Oh, thank you Kitty.
You're welcome.
I win!
Jackie.
This is for you.
Oh my god!
Pink and purple with a unicorn!
You remembered!
Of course I remembered.
I remember everything you tell me even when you think I don't.
Really.
What's my favorite season?
Fall?
Jackie: Why?
Uh, the outfits flatter your chestnut eyes.
Jackie: And?
Slimming lines and dark colors.
Jackie: Oh my god, Michael!
When you started acting like an immature jerk, I started having doubts about us.
But now this purple and pink unicorn candy dish proves you're a grown up!
Oh!
I'm a bridesmaid!
First of all, Midge and I would like to thank everyone for coming.
It really means a lot to us.
The vows we're exchanging were written by our daughter Donna, whom we love very much.
Midgey, I consider it a privilage to be your husband.
Donna, I actually feel that way!
Bob, I'm proud and very grateful to be your wife.
We've known each other since we were practically kids.
So we know all the good stuff   and all the not so good stuff about each other.
I can't imagine feeling about anyone else the way I feel about you.
Because I love you.
I always loved you.
And I wanna make you a promise.
No matter what happens  Good or bad  I will always love you.
Awww!
Ok, Donna wait.
What?
Well, first you drag me away from the wedding, and then you kiss me all the way over here, and then you pull me upstairs and shove me into my bedroom and put your hands all over my body, I just-I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Huh.
If only there were a way to make my feelings clear with some sort of action!
Yeah, heh, ok, that's, um, ha ha, extremely funny.
But uh, every, every time this starts happening, it winds up not happening.
And then, you skip home  tra la la la la.
I know, I know, and I'm sorry.
It's just, you know, before now I wasn't ready.
Yeah, and, I understand that Donna, it's just that-wait, wait, go back!
I wasn't ready before now.
Before now, like  right now?
Eric, when I had to write those vows, I had to think about love.
When I thought about love, I thought about you.
I love you Eric, and I, I wanna be with you.
God, Donna, I  love you.
Are you sure sure?
Yes, yes.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
So.
This is what it's like to not be a virgin!
Yeah.
So how are you?
Good.
- How are you?
- Good!
good!
It was good!
Right?
I can honestly say, the best I've ever had.
Was I good?
Were you good?
Donna, you know how my mom's all over my back to write thank you notes and I never do, well, trust me, you're getting a thank you note.
Ok.
We better get back downstairs before people start wondering where we are.
Right.
Oh!
And we're gonna need a cover story, so  yeah, let's just tell 'em all we had sex.
No!
Yeah, I know, I'm kidding, uh we'll say we went out for ice, because  we needed to cool down from having sex!
Maybe I should do the talking.
Yeah, well, you know, try to work it in somewhere that we had sex, in conversation, if it comes up.
Gra-uh-gracefully!
See Fez, you take all the partially consumed drinks, and mix 'em together to combine one giant über drink!
In this case, Torn Wallbanger Bloody Sunrise on the Beach!
Kelso, have you been avoiding me?
You kidding me?
I'm right here, aren't I?
It's just that ever since I threatened to tell Jackie about the two of us, you've seemed distant.
Laurie, that's just crazy, all right?
You blackmailing me has just brought us closer together.
Hey, there kids, where've you two been?
God, Dad can't we be gone for a minute without you making all sorts of accusations?
I mean, god, it was just a minute!
To be fair, Donna, it was a little more than a minute.
Jackie: Donna, one of your drunken uncles is touching me.
Oh my god.
Jackie: Oh my god!
We need to talk.
Right now!
What?
Yay, my first paycheck from Price Mart!
The dark times are over, Kitty!
Oh, honey, those weren't dark times, it was  an economic segue!
Well, it's over.
We should celebrate!
Come on, Kitty, let's get you pregnant!
Red!
I'm kidding!
You know I can barely stand the kids we have!
You know what we should do?
Treat ourselves to something nice.
I know!
We can turn on the heat!
Jackie: All right.
Tell me everything.
No.
Jackie: Come on, Donna, we're supposed to be friends.
Aren't we friends?
Well, yeah.
Jackie: Ok, then.
So.
What'd it look like?
Jackie!
Jackie: Ok, we'll come back to that one.
So how was it?
Jackie, I don't really wanna talk about it.
Jackie: Oh.
That bad, huh?
No, no, no.
It was great.
It just wasn't what I expected.
I don't think we did it right.
Jackie: So Eric's not good?
It was more like like neither of us was good.
Jackie: Donna.
It's not up to the woman to be good.
I dunno, Jackie.
I mean, I love Eric, but when the moment came, it was just like, awkward.
And weird.
And .
I dunno, I just felt so far away, you know.
Jackie: No.
But go on!
I mean, during it I just remember thinking, you know, this it it?
This is what everyone  Jackie: Everyone what?
That's as far as I got.
Jackie: Oh.
See, that's the problem.
That's not the problem.
Jackie: Oh, trust me, that's a problem.
Ok, you know what Jackie?
Everything's fine.
Just don't tell anyone about this, ok?
Ok.
Ok?
Ok!
Eric and Donna had sex?
Jackie: Yeah, yeah.
And Eric wasn't good at it.
Wow.
Really.
That's great!
And I would've gotten away with it, too.
If it wasn't for those darn kids.
Oh, I love the Scooby Doo.
Forman, what the hell are you grinning about?
What?
A guy can't grin?
I think that maybe Forman and Donna finally made the beast with two backs.
The Backasaurus?
So?
Well, Hyde, I'm not saying yes, and I'm not saying no, but I'm especially not saying no.
Thank god, man, I'm telling you, I couldn't deal with one more week of that will they, won't they crap.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's going on?
Donna made Forman a man.
Oh, yeah, she did.
Really?
So.
How was it?
Well boys  I tell ya.
It was as if, in that one magic moment, the two people, Donna and Eric, ceased to exist.
And were replaced instead by one perfect being.
Donnaric Formsciotti.
So.
Eric, you're saying it was good?
Kelso, was Michaelangelo's creation of Adam good?
Yes, Kelso, it was good.
So, well, my first time, Jackie called me the Apollo rocket of love.
What kind of rocket were you?
Where're you going with this, Kelso?
Nowhere.
'CEPT JACKIE SAID YOU WERE TOTALLY LAME IN THE SACK!
!
!
Jackie said?
!
?
Yeah.
Donna told Jackie and Jackie told me.
Oh!
But you can't tell Jackie I told you 'cause she'd get pissed.
It's okay, Eric.
Maybe sex isn't your thing.
All right.
Almost there!
Oh, I can't wait to see what we got!
Oh, you're gonna love it!
Are you ready?
Uh-huh!
Ta-da!
A motorcycle?
Don't you love it?
Of course I do, Red.
What woman wouldn't?
Oh, you hate it.
Of course I do, Red!
What woman wouldn't?
Red, I thought, I thought we would get something we both would enjoy, like a, a necklace!
But this is much better than a necklace!
How?
Well, it's not a stupid necklace!
But it's shiny!
- Hey!
- Hey.
So  what's new?
Well, turns out I'm really lame in the sack, what's new with you?
W-what?
Oh, it's all the news.
Jackie told Kelso and, Kelso told all of us, so, sorry I'm "lame in the sack".
I never said that.
I said it felt awkward and weird.
What a relief.
You could've told me!
How am I supposed to tell you something like that?
I don't know, how 'bout, hey Eric, you're awkward and weird!
You know what?
That's the problem.
We did this really huge thing and now I feel like I can't even talk to you about it!
Well, god knows you can talk to Jackie.
I knew this was gonna happen.
What?
I knew that once we did this, everything would change, and damned if it didn't.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it, maybe we should never do it again.
Great.
Oh .
Great!
Oh great.
Look, Kitty.
Look how good I look on it.
Hey!
We could get matching jackets.
You know how you love things that match!
Red, what were you thinking?
Oh, come on, Kitty!
You know the last thing I bought for myself?
A hose.
Well, I'm sorry, but we can't afford it.
What do you mean?
I'm working again.
But we still have to get outta debt.
And we have to pay for Eric's college and we got, we got Laurie's wedding and, and you know whoever she ends up with is not gonna be any Rockefeller!
Ah, I suppose you're right.
Well at least let's take one ride on it before we bring it back?
Ok, fine.
Oh, that feels nice.
Oh!
That feels very nice!
Jackie: Michael, how could you?
What'd I do?
Jackie: Michael, I didn't tell you about Eric's  sad dilemma so you could make fun of him.
I told you so you could help him.
Well Jackie, I can't help him and burn him at the same time.
Uh, I mean come on, Jackie, it's funny!
And he must have been really bad.
- Jackie: Yeah well, so were you.
- Uh!
All right Jackie, I don't think you know what you're saying.
Ok, 'cause you called me your Apollo rocket of love.
Jackie: Right.
But I said it like, Oh, Michael, you're a regular Apollo rocket of love.
Ok, I don't hear a difference.
Jackie: Eric, if it makes you feel any better, Michael was really bad his first time, too.
Uh!
Oh, that's supposed to make me feel better?
Jackie: Doesn't it?
Yeah, a little.
Thanks Jackie!
Forman, I've been thinking about your problem with Donna.
And after hours of serious consideration  it still makes me laugh.
Hey.
Ya leave Eric alone.
All right?
He's our friend.
And he needs our help, in this his most desperate hour.
I'm with yo, buddy, Semper Fi!
Gee, Kelso, why the sudden change of heart?
Oh, Maybe it's because the "Apollo rocket of love" blew up all over the launch pad?
Whoa ho ho, a mystery!
One suitable for Scooby Doo and his gang of cartoon teenagers!
You know guys, sometimes I wish we were cartoon teenagers.
Zoinks.
That'd be super, Fez.
Look, man.
If god had meant for virgins to lose it to other virgins, he wouldn't have given us middle-aged hookers, man!
Amen, brother!
Because if there's one thing men like us know, it's how to have sex.
Oh, I cannot live with this lie.
Everyone prepare to be shocked!
I, Fez, am still a virgin.
Gosh, my world no longer makes sense.
Fine Hyde, but, now that the middle-aged hooker ship has sailed, what am I supposed to do?
Well, I know I got a lot better when I started making it with your sister.
I got it!
You should make it with my sister!
Kelso, I've seen your sister.
She's a virgin, and she's gonna be.
For a long time.
All right, what are you saying?
Well I think he's saying, moooo.
Ok, maybe you did not hear me.
Fez, the man you all revere, has still not had sex.
Yeah, heard you the first time.
Forman, you've gotta figure out what you're doing wrong, man.
And fast.
You know what women call guys who are lame in the sack?
Just friends.
Yeah, but you can't let the pressure get to you.
I mean, don't think about how embarrassing it'd be if you tried and you couldn't.
And she'd stare at you with those cruel black eyes, as if to say  you're not really a man, Michael!
You're not a man at all!
!
!
Oh kay, well, this has been, really helpful guys.
All right, you called my bluff.
I am not really a virgin, heh heh.
Yes I am.
- All right, fun's fun.
Time to take it back.
- No.
No?
No, I like it, I wanna keep it.
But you said yourself, we gotta save money for the kids!
Oh, screw the damn kids.
Oh, Red, I have worked double shifts all year, I deserve this.
I want my hog.
You know, Laurie might not even get married.
Maybe Eric'll get a scholarship to college.
Oh, hell, he might be too stupid to even get in college!
Well, Red, we can only hope!
Ok, so just out of curiosity, no reason, what was your first time like?
Oh, my first time was with a guy named  your father.
My first time was with this guy named Darren.
It was really special!
Oh no, wait.
It wasn't Darren, it was Robert?
I think, Robert!
Well, um, Red and I waited until after we were married.
Like, five seconds after we were married.
We said, to heck with the receiving line and hit the nearest closet!
Oh, I remember running my hands through his long blonde hair and listening to his beautiful British accent.
You see, because, back then your father was blonde and British!
No, no no no, not Robert.
There was this guy  what was his name?
Or was it his brother?
It'll come to me.
Good god, that dress must've had a hundred buttons down the back, but Red got it off in no time!
You wouldn't know it to look at him but Red's got very nimble fingers.
Nimble!
I just remember it was very disappointing.
And I never saw that guy again.
I mean, your father.
I mean, you father was the first.
Don't tell your father, ok?
I wanna say Billy.
But that's not right.
Anyway, I just remember that he wasn't very good.
And it was just wonderful.
Eventually.
Ok, Donna.
Here's the deal.
Do you have any Rolaids?
uh, I've been thinking, about what we said, about us not doing it again, and uh, I've decided that's just crazy talk.
But Eric, we did it and now everything's a mess.
See, Donna, everything you and I do is a mess.
At first.
I mean, face it, we're just a couple of goons here.
The first time we kissed, the first time we went out The first time I let you get to second.
Exactly.
Wait, what'd I do wrong then?
God, it was like you were tuning a radio.
- Ok.
Ok, but, do I still do that?
- No.
And the kissing?
Has that gotten better?
Yeah, like a zillion times better.
And, Donna, you know why those things got better?
Becausewekinda care about each other and we talk and, we make things work.
Yeah, but what if it doesn't work?
And then not only does it not work, but we don't have what we used to have?
Donna, we will.
We love each other, right?
So, trust me.
It can only get better.
Ok, so, I guess what you're saying is, we need practice.
And lots of it!
Yes!
So?
Yeah, it was a little better.
A little better?
I am the king!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Man, where the hell is Eric?
I gotta get outta here before Jackie finds me.
What did you do now?
Shes mad because I didnt say love you after lunch.

I was thinking maybe tomorrow night we could go shopping, just the two of us.
Why?
Well because we need to get you some new shoes and some underwear.

Yeah, and I can shop for my own underwear.
Oh no you cannot.
The last time you went you bought them too snug and I want grandchildren.
Yeah Well I have to Bye!
You know, he used to love going shopping with me.
- Well Kitty hes sixteen - Seventeen.
Whatever, the point is when a boy hits that age, they dont wanna spend time with their mother.
And if they do, theyre weird!
Its not a big deal.
Well it is a big deal to me Red Forman!
It is a big deal!
Okay Well I justI just wish sometimes he would want to spend time with me.
Well force him!
It doenst matter what he wants, as long as were paying his way, we own him.
Fez has a girlfriend?

Still, what's that about Fez snagging a girl away from you, I never thought I'd see the day.
So what's she like?
It's just so twilightzone, I mean, to see Fez and Eric!
Your mother asked you a question about the foreign kid.
What?
Oh.
Never mind.
Okay, that's it.
Eric, you're gonna spend some time with your mother.
What did I do?
!
Red!
Don't make it sound like a punishment!
Well it is!
Red!
You can look at it any way you want, but it's gonna happen dammit!
Wait, wait, is this because I didn't want to go shopping with mom?
You don't wanna go shopping with your mom?
!
Boy, I tell ya, if I had a mom, I would go shopping with her every single day, because no one loves you like your mom.
That's true Eric honey, we don't have to go shopping.
We could go see a movie.
It'll be like a little date.
No no no!
Shopping's great!
You know I uh need new underwear so I think a date is a great idea.
Hey, you guys should go see Annie Hall, I think you'll just love it Mrs. Forman.
See, Stephen's helping out.
Thank you Stephen.
Now Annie Hall, I would like to see that movie.
Oh Eric's just dying to see that movie.
ButI don't JUST DYING!
Uhm I guess Fez really got me with all of the poems he left at my locker.

So, where are you guys going?
We are going to the Red Lobster for a romantic dinner of red lobster.
See you guys later!
Okay, I don't like her.

Just because she is dating someone in our group.
Bites the big one doesn't it?
Well I gotta go to work.
Am I right Donna?
Don't you hate her?
Not really Jackie, I kinda like her.
Hey what was that for?
!
That's for not writing me poems Michael!
.
love you Jackie Leo, did you take your turn yet man?
No man, I can't decide between 'college' or 'career'.
Well we can't start until you decide, so choose man, or I'll start working.
Hey, don't rush me man, this decision is gonna effect the rest of my life.
Go to college.
Okay.
But what if those frat-guys make fun of my hair?
And beat me up like, like fascists and stuff.
Well then just start a career.
I can't let those frat-guys get away with it man.
Leo man, it's just a game.
Yeah, Life is hard.
Well now see, I didn't know that you liked green peppers.
When did that happen?
August 5th, 1972.
I mean, I mean do you like green peppers?
Why yes I do.
Very much.
So how is Donna?
What?
!
We haven't done anything yet.
What?
Relax!
I'm not here to grill you about your life Eric.
But you know, young adults do have a responsibility MOM!
Please!
Honey, you may not realise it right now, but I'm actually doing you a giant favour by making you spend time with me.
Well, thank you.
No no no, I mean it.
Boys who reject their mothers grow up to have huge problems.
You will hate yourself.
And every relationship you have with a woman will just be a mess.
So, if you don't spend time with me now, you may never have sex.
Hahahahaha!
I'm teasing!
A little.
Aha Hey, look how far Florence is from Venice Eric, honey, I just wanted to spend a little time alone with you outside of the house.
That's all.
Mom, that's fine.
And in fact, you know what, this is great.
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyyy!
!
Forman is out on a date!
With his mom!
Forman and his mom!
Forman and his mom!
My goodness, that Woody Allen is neurotic.
Well if I lived in New York I'd be in therapy too.
The streets are filthy.
WOW, Diane Keaton is NOT wearing a bra.
Okay, don't let your mom see you look.
But I have to look.
I'm looking.
I'm looking and I don't care!
Oh please.
He expects her to make love while he is wearing those black socks?
Note to self, throw away all black socks.
Mah Jong?
What the hell is Mah Jong?
Mah Jong?
What the hell is Mah Jong?
Okay, an aspirine the size of a brick.
Now that is funny!
Finally, a scene without sex!
Oh greatdrugs.
Thank you Woody Allen.
Huh, I guess cocaine is expensive.
I'm finally getting the feeling back in my jaw.
I don't get that, I mean he was just in bed with her and OHokay I see.
Oh God, I hope my mom doens't get that.
Oh I wonder if Eric gets that.
Well, I'm not gonna explain it to him.
So now, Patty is seeing Fez, and I just don't get it.
She could have had me.
I'm a real catch man.
Allriiiiight!
I had twins man!
Oh look they're so beautiful!
Congratulations.
Thanks man.
Hey I don't want to be competitive or anything man, but I've got two kids and you don't have any.
You're just a lonely plummer dude.
It wouldn't be so bad, but it's Fez.
I taught him everything he knows.
It's all backwards man.
I guess you just can't dwell on things man.
Yeah, maybe I shoud just be happy for Fez, I mean, it's the first time in his whole life that he's ever had a girl you know.
Yeah you know, a while back I picked up a card you know, and I had a car accident.
And uh I was dwelling on that man.
I'm sorry, what were you talking about?
Maybe I should get back to work.
If you get back to work you're fired man Hey I got twins again man!
Just admit it Donna!
Patty is totally wrong for Fez.
Well Jackie, I have never seen you quite this transparant before.
What are you talking about?
She is so awful Donna, let's hate her forever Donna!
Let's shave her head and run around town Donna!
Focus Donna!
We're ragging up Patty, remember.
Jackie did you ever think that maybe you hate Patty because you like Fez?
Oh you are in dangerous territory Pinciotti!
No, I mean, it's true.
You hate seeing Fez drool over someone other then you.
You're crazy, I don't like Fez.
I think you do.
Oh shut up.
Jackie, you're blushing!
Oww!
Look, I'll admit that Fez would be okay for a quick fling if I was off on a vacation with my parents in Michigan or Cuba.
Where no-one would ever find out.
Ever, ever, ever!
!
Fez and Jackie sitting in a tree Mr. and Mrs. Fez.
Fez?
Donna, please, please shut up!
Jackie you are so totally hot for him I can see it in your eyes.
Oh my God, OH MY GOD!
I like Fez!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
!
Well boy, wasn't that fun, seeing all those sex-scenes with your mother.
Oh it was super sexy.
I'm so glad we could enjoy that together, really I am.
So I guess women in New York don't wear bras.
It's disgusting.
And we should move there immidiately.
Well I don't know about you but I've seen enough nipples for one day.
Mom!
What?
I don't ever want to hear you say nipples okay?
Why not?
Men have nipples.
- Your father has nipples!
- NO!
He does not!
Okay.
So, what was your favourite part of the movie?
I don't wanna tell you Oh come on!
Okay, uhm, Diane Keaton's nipples!
Okay, pay me.
Leo, I gotta help the customer man, I think he's gonna drive away.
Let him go, I don't need his stinkin' photo money.
I'm a doctor!
Okay man, you know what, that's it.
This game is over man.
This is not life!
THIS is life  Yeah but this life is so much better then this life!
In the game, I've got kids man.
In real life my kids split on me.
Really man?
Yeah.
My parents split on me.
Oh wow, and now we've found eachother.
Hey do you wanna be my father?
Sure.
Okay, go ahead and spin 'dad'!
Maybe Mah Jong is a type of food.
Oh you know what, you could be right, it's probably Chinese noodles.
Yes!
Hey, you wanna go see Close Encounter sometime?
Yeah I'd love to!
Very cool.
Goodnight mom Oh what did he do?
!
I swear I'll kick his ass!
!
No he was justhe was absolutely wonderful.
Oh Okay ERIC/ Is something wrong?
DONNA/ No, why?
ERIC/ I don't know, it's justyouit's you seem very removed.
DONNA/ No I'm fine.
ERIC/ Are you sure?
DONNA/ Uhuh.
ERIC/ You know, maybe it's me, but you do, you seem very removed.
DONNA/DIANE : Eric have you seen my geometrybook?
Cause when you two are doing that I might as well do some homework.
ERIC/ You see?
!
This is what I call being removed!
Donna, when we're making out, you're not thinking about like..
geometry and stuff are you?
Never.
Unless I have a test the next day.
You know I think you did the sweetest thing in the world to go out with your mom.
Thank you.
- So did Mommy buy you new underpants?
- Okay!
Let me see the underpants!
Let me see it!
!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Eric!
ERIC!
Donna, this is a tricky maneuver okay, I need quiet.
Oh my God!
It's the cops!
Eric!
We're completely NAKED!
- Don't panick!
I uhh have a plan.
- Okay Go away!
That's the plan?
!
That's NOT a good plan!
Yeah, no, that's the plan.
I mean, we're totally naked, I think he'll probably just go away.
Crap.
Have you seen my pants?
- Where are you going?
- Out.
Where?
A place.
Who with?
Doctors and stockbrokers.
Oh holy hell!
And and and the heater is broken in the VistaCruiser, that's why it was so hot so uh naturally we removed one or two articles of clothing which you know in retrospect was probably not that good an idea Eric, how stupid do you think I am?
You're right, should've cracked a window, good thinking.
Eric, we know what you were doing in the car.
No, we don't 'know'.
Trust me, we know.
No, no, we don't 'know'!
I know!
I know!
Course you know, you majored in it.
What were you thinking?
Mr. Forman uhh it was my idea too.
So uhm, please stop yelling at Eric?
Because What?
!
Just play dead and cover your face.
No Eric, it's okay What we did was a choice that we made.
A choice we made as adults.
- Oh really.
You're an adult?
- Don't answer!
It's a trap.
Yes.
We're adults.
Okay Donna, then as an adult I expect you to go next door and tell Bob and Midge just exactly what happened tonight.
Okay.
I'll tell them.
Good.
And I'm gonna check to see that you did.
Oh come on!
Why would you do that?
!
Donna I won't keep something like this from your parents.
They think we're friends.
Hey cool man, a CB radio!
Yeah!
So I narrowed down my potential CB handles to two choices, either Stud Kickass or Flex BuffChest.
Gee Kelso, what about Beef Dingleberry?
Great, now I've got three choices Radio crackles: Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, this is Hot-To-Trot, Foxy-Lady and Nice-And-Easy Oh my God, they sound nice!
And easy!
Quick, come on we need handles so we can talk to 'm.
Okay uh OH OH we'll be the ModSquad!
That's perfect, I'm Linc.
I'M Linc!
Why do you get to be Linc?
HYDE : The magic afro baby!
OkayI've got dibs on Pete.
Okay, then what is my macho cop-handle?
Julie!
Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, this is Pete I'm Linc And Julie.
It is so nice to talk to you my lovelies.
Hot-To-Trot: Hey Julie, cool accent!
You sound sexy.
Accent?
What the hell is she talking about?
- Something on your mind?
- Yeah.
There is something important I want to tell you guys.
Eric and I have been going out for a while now and we did something you two should know about.
Yes?
Well see, Eric and I, uhm we uhm we rode the Forman's motorcycle!
There!
I said it!
Weight is just off my shoulders.
Donna, that was wrong.
But not a wrong as it could have been, cause it could have been Sex!
That's what I thought too!
What?
!
No, that's crazy,that's that's silly, you guys are silly gooses!
You make me laugh, cause you're silly!
So the cops caught you doing it?
Oh my God!
That is SUCH a turn on!
That is NOT a turn on!
You're a little pervert!
Jackie, I have a big problem.
How am I gonna tell my parents?
Okay, if you need to use the bathroom, you should go now.
Cause I have a lot to say.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Okay.
You're first mistake, was wearing pants for car-sex.
When you do it in the car, skirts are your best friend!
Zip-zap, bim-bam, you're done, you're dressed, you're back at the mall!
Jackie, I'm screwed!
If I tell my parents, only one of two things could happen.
Either they'll be furious, or they'll ask me how it was.
Here now, have some peas I'd rather have sexwith Donna.
Mmmmmm tapioca!
Hmmmm sex with Donna!
Oh you, you are just so cute.
Ahahahha!
Say Ma-Ma!
Sex with Don-Na!
- No baby no!
- Yes!
- No!
- Yes!
- NO!
No!
YES!
NO NO NO NO Kitty!
Slut!
What?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
Kitty, when it's three o'clock on a saturday afternoon and you're still in bed, I know something is wrong.
Oh Red I'm fine.
Why should I care that my sweet babyboy was defiled by some jiggly red-haired tramp?
Kitty!
What I can't figure out is how she tricked him into it.
Look it's not like we didn't know this was coming.
You're always showing Eric anatomical diagrams and charts and slides.
You've been prepping him since he was six!
Are you blaming me?
!
No no, heck no.
It's my fault.
Men are dirty.
Well good.
Kitty I just want you to get out of bed.
You know, none of us had lunch and uhm we're kinda hungry Well, it's a house full of grown men and I would think that one of you FULLY grown men would know how to make a damn sandwich!
Well maybe I should go I sure as hell would!
And when Bob and Midge look at me with their big dumb eyes, I just I can't find the words.
Okay Donna, I've given this a lot of thought, and I think I should be the one to tell your parents we had sex.
Oh my God, Eric that is so great!
Thank you!
What?
No no!
What?
No!
It was a bluff!
I was bluffing..
to seem nice.
Oh crap this is a nightmare.
Fine, I'll do it myself.
What?
No, wait.
Look, we told my parents together so, hey let's tell your parents together!
Thank you.
So do you wanna go get it over with?
Yeah, let's go tell your parents.
- Okay - Okay Donna, I want to go with you, but my legs have gone numb.
Breaker 1-9, Breaker 1-9, this is Pete, Linc and Julie, we're looking for a 20 on Hot-To-Trot, FoxyLady and Nice-And-Easy over HOT-TO- Hey guys!
Hello Hot-To-Trot!
This is Julie.
I was just wondering, are you fat?
Wow Fez!
No, I'd say that's not a bad question.
HOT-TO- Well, why don't you guys come see for yourselves?
We could meet tonight.
Oh tonight?
No tonight we have to watch Love Boat so I don't think As soon as I heard you were down Mrs. Forman, I had to come and see you.
Because I know the blues.
But you know, the good news is, Donna is on the pill.
So, they can do it like a zillion times a day and nothing bad can happen.
Yeah, they can just do it and do it and do it and do it and do it!
JACKIE!
Good you're here.
Get out.
But I'm trying to help.
Ah you wanna help?
Go make me a sandwich.
So Kitty.
You think maybe it's time to get up?
No.
Okay!
You know what.
Kitty, you gotta shape up!
I can't believe that you're all surprised that your seventeen year old is doing what seventeen year olds do!
BIG DEAL!
Now get the hell out of bed and BUCKLE UP!
Oh jeez honey I'm sorry!
GET OUT!
So, what do you kids need to tell us?
I tried to guess but my mind's a total blank!
Actually, Mrs. Pinciotti, Mr. Pinciotti, it's something I need to tell you Sorry, I almost threw up I'm fine now.
You both know how much I respect your daughter, how much I love your daughter, and uhm, funny thing about love, haha, is uhm sometimes, we express it in a physical way.
You better not say what I think you're gonna say.
Cause I'll be mad.
And funny thing about mad, haha, is sometimes I express it in a physical way.
I love your daughter and I totally respect her, and I never stopped respecting her.
Even when the cops came.
Well I'm sorry Eric.
But I still gotta twist your neck shut!
Dad!
You know you shouldn't be threathening Eric.
You should be uhm thanking him.
What?
!
Wow!
He's treated me like a queen since the day we started dating.
Eric and I have sex.
There.
You know.
At least I have a nice boyfriend and not some juvenile delinquent.
Like that Fonzie!
Well that'snice.
And at least Eric had the guts to come over here and tell you man to man.
Well, I'm happy for you.
And thank you for being honest.
That took a lot of courage, didn't it Bob?
I'm going to bed!
So - How was it?
- OH GOD!
Boy oh boy.
I'll tell you Eric, you take the cake.
Oh man, there is cake?
!
There's no cake.
We're all starving to death and it's all your fault.
You broke your mothers heart!
She's up there crying about how you're all grown up and you don't need her anymore.
Butthat's not true.
Well I know that.
You're a helpless idiot.
Ah.
Okay.
I could pretend to need help with my homework.
No no no-one gives a crap about that.
Oh!
I could pretend to be sick.
No thatWait a minute, that might work.
She mothered the heck out of you when you broke your leg that time.
Right, I could say I have a fever.
Or better yet, we could walk to the garage, I hit you in the elbow with a baseball bat!
I'm gonna stick with the fever.
If you wanna go through life doing everything half-assed, that's your decision son.
Okay!
They said they'd wait out front.
Here we go, cold beer and hot babes!
Or vice-versa!
Hey guys, did we get a yes or a no on the fat question?
Oh goody, they're not fat, they're just old!
If your voice is hot, then you should be hot, those are the RULES!
Damn old ladies with hot voices.
Let's go No no, I'm staying.
You two are shallow!
I'm not shallow Fez, I just judge chicks on their looks.
Suit yourself, but sometimes the old ones are super grateful.
Yeah, okay Fez, but if you wind up at some car feeling up June Cleaver don't come crying to me.
Yeah!
Hello my lovelies, I am Julie.
Which one of you is Hot-To-Trot?

{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey, Mr. Bonkers!
You naughty kitty!
Ill be right home, keep my bed warm, okay?
Hey, keep your paws to yourself!
Thats my girlfriend.
So what was your favorite part of the movie?
Uh, my favorite part of the movie was when we made out.
- Yeah.
Movies are fun.
- Yeah.
Goodnight.
You know, its amazing how you always manage to pull the car right up to the garage, but not actually in to it.
Yep.
Takes a keen eye, and a sure foot.
How would you like your keen eye to watch my sure foot kick your smart ass?
Why dont I pull the car in?
What the ?
Youre moving it a foot, and you hit something!
Oh, god, no!
Its  its Mr. Bonkers!
Wow, that is one dead cat.
If I was stranded on a desert island with only one form of cheese  no question, it would have to be the puff.
You know whos my little cheese puff?
Jackie!
Oh, Michael, youre so cute!
Youre cute!
Cuter!
Cutest!
All right, all right!
You guys gotta shut up before I blow cheese puff chunks.
All right Michael, Ill see you tonight at eight.
Okay.
Ill be counting the minutes.
Cant you just use a clock?
Man, were so back in love!
I remember when it was all  Youre an idiot, Michael, and, Whoa, whatd I do?
 Good times.
Sorry man, but I love her.
Yes, but you dont deserve her, you son of a bitch.
No what?
I said uh, good cheese puffs, you son of a bitch.
Hey, Kelso.
I thought wed get together tonight, so, take a shower, okay?
But Laurie, Im, Im seeing Jackie tonight.
Oh, thats so sweet!
Uh, no.
Ill see you at eight.
But, but  You heard me!
Damn!
My second girlfriend is such a drag.
This is bad, man.
Yes.
But only for you.
Cheese puff?
Thats pretty good, Mr. Clean.
Ha!
Ha ha!
Well, you know me!
Im super neat!
Hey, you know, I cant find Mr. Bonkers anywhere.
Have you seen him?
No!
Uh, I mean well yeah, not since last night.
Huh, well  Meow, meow, meow, meow, KILLED, meow, meow.
What?
!
?
I said its weird!
He always sleeps with me but he never came home last night.
Lemme know if you see him, okay?
Oh, sure thing!
Will do.
Mr. Bonkers!
Yeah, Im going to hell.
You didnt tell her?
I felt so guilty, I just I couldnt.
Is it because youre kinda glad its dead?
No.
Hey, maybe I dont have to tell her.
Maybe shell just think Mr. Bonkers ran away.
- That works.
Thats what we told you when, um - Shhh!
What?
Eric, honey, eat your pizza rolls.
Oh, come on.
How hard can this be?
You go over there, and you say, hey.
Im a cat killer.
I mur I murdered your cat.
But you try to say it with a straight face.
What?
Am I the only one that sees the humor in this?
I think you might be, Red.
Oh, come on, that thing was always messing in my yard, going through our garbage  Now we have Hyde for that.
Oh, yeah, Laurie, and what exactly do you do?
Oh!
Thats right.
The Packers!
Excuse me, dilemma here?
Eric, this is not a dilemma.
You have to tell Donna.
Just be gentle and, and maybe take her a nice little gift.
Yeah, like a kitty sized head stone.
You know what?
I should have known you were lying.
Sure, Flipper was fast, but turtles dont just run away.
Hyde?
Which ones your favorite Charlies Angel?
I kinda like the blonde with the huge rack.
Yes.
And she distracts the criminals with her huge rack.
Heh.
- Plus shes got that huge rack.
- Yeah.
Ow, my stomach.
My cheesy puffy friends have become my enemy.
Man, you guys, I gotta break up with Laurie.
Kelso, remember how you said you were gonna juggle em both til it blew up in your face?
Yeah.
Well kablooie!
Okay, I know I tried before, right?
But this time, Lauriell see how much I love Jackie, and that my motives are good and pure.
And then shell just let me go Then you and all the leprechauns can ride unicorns to a wonderful celebration in fairy land!
Look!
The angels are running in slow motion!
Damn!
Thats just good TV.
Hey, beautiful!
Hows it going?
Oh, pretty good.
Except I found this here kitten who told me he was looking for someone to love him.
Oh my god!
Oh, hes so cute!
Thank you Eric, thats so sweet!
Well, I hope Mr. Bonkers doesnt get jealous!
Hi!
Yea, I dont think thats gonna happen, Donna, because  I accidentally killed Mr. Bonkers.
So!
What are you gonna name this little fella here?
What?
What are you talking about?
Ive had that cat since I was three!
What happened?
Well, last night, I was pulling in the car after our date  After our date?
Last night?
Eric, I was looking for him and I asked you.
And you said you hadnt seen him.
And you knew I was worried sick about him!
I know, Donna!
Thats why it was so hard to tell you.
Hey there, ho there, hi there.
Whats going on?
Why dont you ask the man who murdered our cat?
No!
No!
Thats not, I didnt murder your cat!
It was  he climbed under my car.
It was a total accident.
Well I should hope so, because what did he ever do to you?
I dont wanna live with this lying anymore.
Because I only love Jackie.
Okay.
So, do you wanna go up to my room and have sex?
Uh .
sure!
No, wait!
No!
No!
Okay, I this Laurie, I Im serious.
Were over.
Wow.
I think you really mean it.
I totally do.
Okay, Kelso, youre free!
You know what Id like, though?
Just one last goodbye kiss.
Um okay, well sure.
Michael!
Jackie!
We were  No, there was  Wow, how ironic, huh?
Eric, I just saw Michael kissing your sister.
Okay, hes a rat!
Hes been cheating on me!
What?
Well, surely there must be some kind of mistake!
Right, guys?
Come on!
Well it sure is a mind blower!
So thats it!
Michael and I are over!
Really?
And by over you mean  I mean over and done!
All right, forever!
Uh-huh.
Now by forever you mean  And after everything I put up with, I mean, god.
Him taking Pam Macy to the prom, setting my house on fire, lying about Laurie, god!
To be fair, thats only the stuff you know about.
This is incredible.
My time has come!
Today, I will make Jackie mine!
Ai!
Hey, whats wrong?
I dont know!
I think my guts are bursting with love!
So, Fez, my mom says your appendix has to come out.
Man, you must be in tons of pain.
Wheeeeeeeeeee!
Cheese puffs out, pain pills in.
Fez loves his pills.
Boy, I wish there was a pill I could take.
Get rid of my pain.
Forget about Jackie pill.
Hell, if they made that pill, Id take it.
Kelso man, this is what you get for trying to do the right thing.
Want to know a secret?
Im not wearing anything under my dress.
Look!
Whoa!
Put that away!
Yeah, man, it just sucks when you try to do the right thing.
And then she yells at you for killing her cat.
Eric, you dont know how lucky you are.
Id give anything to be able to tell Jackie I killed her cat.
Nothings sadder than when two people break up.
Except this time when its funny!
By the way, Eric, if your mom ever says, ready for your catheter, the answer is no.
Donna, were supposed to be friends.
Would it have killed you to say, I know you love him, but Michaels a jerk?
Jackie, I think my exact words were, I know you love him, but Michaels a jerk.
So have you seen Kelso since  No.
Hes a liar, and a cheater.
Maybe thats how all guys are.
I know how you feel.
Like, its bad enough what Eric did to Mr. Bonkers, then he lied to me.
Yeah.
Eric put off telling you something because he didnt wanna hurt you.
Whoo!
That is so much worse that cheating on you with another woman.
Oh, wait.
No its not!
Oh.
Wow.
I guess Eric was just trying to be nice.
Maybe Im overreacting.
Look.
Lemme tell you something, Donna.
Until goody-goody Eric cheats on you with your stupid dead cat, I suggest you shut up.
God, I miss Jackie.
I KNOW!
!
Well, youre in luck, Fez!
The bars closed early today, so we found a doctor to do your surgery!
Oh, good.
I see theyve already shaved you.
Actually, I did that myself.
Lucky coincidence, huh?
Okay, then.
Time for sleepy-sleepy.
Okay, now count back from one hundred.
One hundred ninety-nine   twenty-seven  Fez voice over: Once upon a time there were three little girls who went to the police academy.
Now they were police.
My name is Fez.
Stand back.
And remember, girls, this ones for Fez.
This is your unlucky day now that Fezs angels are here.
Dont move.
Im gonna blow up Fez headquarters.
I cant bear to see any of you with such a handsome foreign sex machine.
This is gonna be a blast.
Whatever.
Youre a real barrel of laughs.
Congratulations on a job well done, angels.
The girls: Thank you, Fez.
Are we going to see you soon?
No, I cant get away.
Im in a little hot water right now.
Fez, Fez, honey!
Oh, thank god you pulled through.
I was afraid youd die before I got to tell you.
I love you!
No, no, Jackie.
No sex now.
We must wait.
Until were married?
No.
Until the catheter comes out.
Fez?
Fez?
Fez?
Fez?
I told you!
No sex now!
Hey there, Midge.
Kitty, uh, insisted I bring this over to show our sorrow because of your loss.
Aw, thanks, Red.
We were all sitting around reminiscing about our dear departed cat.
Mr. Bonkers J. Pinciotti.
Do you have a story you wanna share, Red?
Wed sure appreciate it.
Seeing as how your son killed him.
Okay.
Well I remember he used to come into my yard, and uh  and uh you know, Id uh throw a bucket at him or  spray him with the hose.
And hed run away.
Then hed come back.
Id do it again!
I guess you you could say we kinda had our own thing.
Wow.
Okay, enjoy the casserole.
We set up a Mr. Bonkers memorial slide show in the other room.
So.
Uh-huh.
Uh, that casserole theres a seven layer.
Of course, uh, two of those layers are peas and I really should have told you right away about your cat, but its a pretty good casserole, theres ham in it.
Look, Eric, I know you didnt wanna hurt me, and I understand that.
It's just weve gotta be honest with each other.
I mean, especially now that weve you know.
Weve you know!
Cause, I just dont wanna end up like Jackie and Kelso.
No, no, I dont think were gonna end up like Jackie and Kelso.
I mean, I lie out of the goodness of my heart.
Its still a lie, Eric.
Yeah, youre right.
Im sorry, Donna.
About everything.
All right, well, from now on, no more secrets.
Oh, god, then I guess Im gonna have to come clean.
Okay, in first grade, behind your back, I used to call you Donna Pinch-my-buttie.
Well, you know Eric, thats okay.
Cause I was the first one to call you Eric Foreskin.
You started that?
Thats not funny.
That one stuck.
Oh, shut up Foreskin!
So, really, breaking up with Michael could be the start of something great.
I am a whole new Jackie.
Really?
Cause youre babbling like the old Jackie.
Jackie.
Ive been looking for you.
Here I am.
Okay, so you two probably wanna be alone.
No, Forman!
How can this not be good?
Come on.
All right.
Jackie, Ive done some terrible and stupid things.
Too many to even list.
Oh, hey, give it a shot, man.
Ill fill in the blanks.
Hyde!
All right.
But Im done making excuses.
And all I can say is  is that Im sorry.
And I love you.
And I will do whatever I can, every day from now on so that you know thats true.
So will you please please  please take me back?
Oh, Michael.
No.
No, you know what?
Were through.
Forever.
Whoa, didnt see that coming.
Fine.
So, um that, that, that was the smartest thing Ive ever done.
And, um and the best.
Hyde!
Why does she always come to me?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Donna have you noticed that every time we do  what we just did, it is always fun?
Eric you're so cute.
Oww, oww.
Donna I think by cute you mean ruggedly handsome.
You read my mind Eric.
Oh yeah that's the other thing after we do that thing I don't really feel like an Eric.
really.
Uh yeah, I think I feel more like a Stan or a Chuck or a, a Maverick.
Do you want to go to a movie tomorrow Maverick?
Oh uh, I told Kelso and Fez I'd hang out with them.
Really .
Oh.
Hey but uh, you can come too if you want.
No that's ok.
Uh really, you should come No you go, have fun.
Are you sure?
Sure, it's not big deal.
Ok, cool.
Swedish pancakes?
What's the catch?
Oh no catch, eat them while they're hot, there's plenty.
Wow, this is a real treat Mrs. Forman.
Psst, careful Steven, there's always a string attached to Swedish pancakes, trust me.
Mom you only make Swedish pancakes when something horrible is about to happen.
Does someone have cancer?
No, no, no.
No one has horrible cancer.
Now let's just sit down as a family and enjoy our special pancakes.
Gotcha!
We're all going to the nursing home to visit Aunt Pearl.
Isn't she dead yet?
Laurie!
Well she is old so, maybe we should call ahead.
Red, can you believe this family?
Well, the Bucs are playing the Celtics.
Oh come on.
All I'm asking is for a quick visit.
Real quick.
Quick, quick, quick.
Say kids how bout a nice trip to old Aunt Pearl's?
Hey!
Thank you Red.
I don't have to go, do I?
I've already been to see her three times this year.
Uh yeah, and I'm a virgin.
God I miss Jackie.
I can't sleep, I can't think, I can still eat, but I mean my life has no meaning.
I'm dead inside.
Oh, so that's what smells.
Yeah Mr. Brokenheart, when was the last time you took a bath man?
Woo, you're getting gamey.
Man, I am so glad Donna's not Jackie, but I'll tell you what, I'm even more glad I'm not you.
No offense.
I gotta win Jackie back.
I got it!
I'll write her a song.
Maybe the best way to get Jackie back is to let her date other people  foreign exchange people.
No man, I think a song is a really great idea.
How bout this one You don't love me anymore.
Caught me cheatin with a whore.
 See cause Laurie's the whore, you get it?
Yeah, my sister is such a whore.
Yeah, I'm gonna write Jackie a song.
I gotta win her back because I can't stop the tears man.
Kelso, we've been over this there's, no crying in the circle.
And then Eric says, You can come if you want.
 if you want?
Ouch.
Right?
I don't know, I think he's sorta taking me for granted.
Ahh I don't know, maybe I'm just overreacting.
No Donna, you're underreacting.
All men take all women for granted all the time.
Jackie ..
Save yourself the heartache Donna.
Break up with Eric now before it's too late.
Then we can be single girls together!
Oohh, we could take a cruise!
I don't know.
I'm just worried.
I mean if he's acting like this now imagine what would happen if we got married or something.
Gloria I just looked at her.
She was just giving me change.
No, Michael it wasn't a look is was a looook.
 Oh my, please don't fight, your father will be home any minute.
Wow Ma, you're all dressed up.
Oh yeah, your father's taking me out tonight.
Well good for you ma, you deserve a night out.
Well ho, ho, ho and whoopdy doo, I'm home.
Oh hi Archie!
Oh geez Edith, no time for the kisses there, the fight's about to start.
But Daddy, you told Ma you were taking her out tonight.
That's true Arch.
Shut up you Meathead you!
Well if you ask my opinion, maybe you just forgot.
Ahh geez Edith there, I didn't forget nothin' so get me a beer and stifle it.
Oh my..
Oh my god Jackie, what am I gonna do?
I don't know Donna, I just don't know.
Oh hi Mr. Forman.
Go talk on your own damn porch!
So you been playing much bingo Pearl?
Pearl : Oh for god sakes Kitty, I ate your damn pudding so go!
Laurie, say something nice.
Finesomething nice.
Pearl : That's my magazine.
Nobody needs to see that.
Pearl : Get out!
You know it's weird, I though that after me and Michael broke up I wouldn't want to hang out here anymore.
Yup, that's what we're hoping.
But I think if I left you'd really miss me.
Right?
I umm suppose that, you know it's important when you have uh a bad breakup that you uh have friends to uh sympathetic uh stuff umm support and uhh I don't know.
Right, so let's go to the mall.
No uh I meant friends like Donna or not me.
But I noticed you're alone a lot and I'm alone a lot, so let's be alone together.
Look, we're alone right now.
That's not really a very good reason for us to Wait.
Let's go to Sizzler.
They've got a salad bar, it's all you can eat plus five different colors of Jello.
I'll buy.
You've been through a rough time, let's go.
Song for Jackie by Michael Kelso You may think this song is stupid So I made a call to cupid And he told me to put my heart out on my sleeve So we can retrieve Our love from the trash, trash, trash What do you think?
Well, I think that you should  draw her a picture.
Hey pal, you think you're funny?
Well someday Donna's gonna crush your stupid little heart too.
Yeah see I don't think so because I've taken special precautions to prevent that very thing from happening.
For instance, I don't sleep with other women Yeah, well it's only because you're chicken.
Hey.
Hey baby, let's say you grab papa a root beer, huh?
Oh my god.
I cannot look.
Listen you worm, I am not your slave or your waitress or your maid, now don't get all Archie Bunkery on me or I will kick your ass to the moon!
Hey Eric, what rhymes with Donna?
I didn't mean to cheat, but she forced me down right coerced me Hey, that's kinda good.
Man, I just asked her for a root beer.
You try to control her Eric and the woman always controls the man.
That's true.
Donna does not control me!
Oh Eric, you have so much to learn, my friend.
Yeah, I wish Jackie was still controlling me.
I love being on a short leash Put the short leash back on me!
!
!
 Kelso, uh let me see that for a second You know that was kinda funny.
That was your guitar.
BURN!
!
Hyde, those boots look really nice on you.
You know Jackie, you buying me boots was just wrong, shoulda let me shoplift them.
No Hyde, I want you to have them.
Besides, I'm saving a fortune now that I don't have to feed and clothe Michael.
Well, if you insist.
I do.
So I was thinking tomorrow night we should you know .
Whoa, whoa, whoa, ok alright come on now Jackie, this was a one time only thing alright?
And if you're trying to bribe me with these boots you can just take them back.
I see.
Oh what are you going to do now, cry?
Oh man, you're crying .
Hey Jackie, come on man, it's going to be fine ok?
This whole thing is going to be fine alright?
No!
!
Bad Jackie!
But Hyde, I thought we agreed that you were alone and I was alone Jackie I'm trying to help you out here, so you've gotta just listen to me.
You have to know that you can do better than Kelso.
But what if I never find anybody else?
Oh you will man, you'll find somebody great.
See I myself don't like you, I find you abrasive, but if I didn't know you and I'd never talked to you, I'd think you were totally hot.
Thank you Hyde.
Anything for you doll.
Pearl honey, please come out.
Laurie, she kinda likes you, do something.
Aunt Pearl why don't you come out and you can show me your damn scrapbooks again.
Pearl : Every time you people come I gotta get dressed and put my teeth in and you're not worth it so get lost!
Now can we go?
No.
Ok fine, I give up.
Let's just go.
I just hope when I get old someone comes to visit me.
Don't be ridiculous Mom, Eric will come.
Well I'm gonna go warm the car up.
No Laurie, this is important to your mother, so sit down.
Come on Pearl, there's a Bucs game on!
Pearl : The Bucs huh?
Well now see, this is nice.
Pearl : The only thing that keeps me alive is watching the Bucks lose!
Go Bucks.
Michael, I don't want to talk to you!
No you're right ok because words don't do it.
That's why I wrote this song.
Oh god.
Jackie please take me backie - I'll get the knack see  - Ok Michael, stop.
Michael Stop Yes please Kelso, stop.
I cannot take this anymore.
This is how you serenade a woman.
Bessame, besssame mucho come si fuera esta noche la ultima bess What are you doing?
Yeah, what are you doing?
Ummm, this is my school song from back home  I don't know Hey what's going on?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Thank you Hyde for tonight, it was very special.
Isn't she nice?
Hey fellas, you like my new boots?
And then Eric says to Donna I cannot go out with you because I am going out with the guys.
 Oh geez.
What?
I don't think that's the problem.
No, What's His Name Is Right, that's the problem.
Look, I don't think I did anything wrong.
I'm not going to apologize to Donna.
Oh yeah?
What?
Why?
Here's the thing, you're assuming that you're good enough for Donna and you're not.
Yes I am.
No you're not, just like I'm not good enough for your mother.
Ok well yeah that's true.
Hey, watch it.
I'm trying to help you out here.
Ok yes sir.
Look, do you really think I wanted to spend the whole damn day sitting in a room with a woman who hates the Bucs and smells like cabbage?
Well I didn't, but that's the price you pay son.
Now you go call Donna before she realizes how much better off she is without you.
Go on now, go!
Go!
!
You heard him, go!
But what about  Blah, blah, blah make the call little man.
Listen Donna  No, wait.
I've been thinking about you know what happened and I realize I might have overreacted.
It's just I'm a little vulnerable now that our relationship has matured.
Donna, no apology necessary.
I welcome your insane behavior and criticism.
Don't be a jerk Eric.
No no, I'm actually, I'm being serious.
I'm willing to do whatever it takes for us to be together.
Whatever it takes, it's worth it.
Well, thank you.
So uh, for future reference, do I have to ask you before I go out with my friends?
No  yes  sometimes.
So uh, how will I know which times.
Well you'll know afterward when I get mad.
Ok so uh is there a umm, you know, maybe a better system than that.
No, I can't really think of one, no.
Ok, fair enough.
I'm really sorry.
Me too.
So uh, I blew off the guys tonight to hang out with you.
So my calendar is wide open.
I'm here for you Donna.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'm hanging out with Jackie.
You can come if you want.
Hahaha, that's really not funny.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hey you guys, guess what part of my body I nicknamed Pink Floyd!
Shut up!
Jackie thought it was cute.
Well Jackie is not here anymore.
I was over at Jackie's this morning, she's so down, it's really depressing.
She's taking the brake-up pretty hard huh.
Cool!
Shut up man, you cried like a baby.
Wow!
I did not cry.
I had something in my eye.
For a week?
I have allergies allright Is it so wrong to feel?
!
Anyway, Jackie is like in really bad shape.
So Kelso, now that you and Jackie are no longer an 'item', uhm, I can ask her out right?
What?
No!
Since when do you like Jackie?
Yeah Fez, I don't think that's a good idea.
Yeah Fez man, that's a bad idea, Jackie's on the rebound right now.
Why don't you just give her a break.
What?
!
Since when did YOU like Jackie?
Allright does everybody here now like Jackie?
!
I still don't.
Thank you Eric.
Fez, Hyde was saying that Jackie is really vulnerable right now.
Yes!
So I must move fast before she gets her self-esteem back!
Yeah, can't blame her for being down, after all, I did dump her.
Actually, she dumped you.
Hey, I don't like to get into specifics.
Oh go turn around the mountain.
Nothing will stop me from asking Jackie out on a date.
Not even.
Ninja's!
FEZ : Stand back!
I want Jackie and no-one will stop ME!
NINJA- Hahahahaha!
You cannot have Jackie!
I will disable you with my cat-like swiftness!
Oh Yeah?
!
NINJA- Yeah!
Oh Yeah?
!
NINJA- Yeah!
Oh!
Fez?
Go ahead Fez.
Ask Jackie out.
She won't go, cause you're foreign.
But go ahead and ask.
You're damn right I will!
No Laurie, I'm not giving you 15 dollars for new hot rollers!
Straight hair is not the end of the world.
Actually Mom, Lauries world is a lot smaller and much more shallow then the average person's.
Come on Mom, curls are important for my self-esteem!
Oh, you know what else might be good for your self-esteem?
Not being the village whore.
Are you trying to start something with me little boy?
!
Because while you have to go to work, all I have to do is sit around and think of ways to hurt you.
Oh I don't know, as village whore I think your day's all full-up!
Shut up!
Ha!
I win!
You're both wrong, so can it!
You're dead!
Oehh I'm so scared!
Kitty, remember that little French restaurant down town?
Frenchies?
The one and only!
I made reservations for tonight, Forman party of two Well now this is so spontanious of you Red.
You haven't been reading my Cosmo have you?
Come on Kitty, we'll get all dressed up, you can even wear my mother's necklace!
Oh, the necklaceyayyy Come on Eric, we're gonna be late.
Bye Mom.
Bye honey!
Oh this is awful.
Come on Mom, French food is not that bad.
Just order pommes-frites.
They're french fries you know.
No honey, the necklace.
I don't have it anymore.
Really?
What did you do with it?
Nothing.
I said nothing.
Mom did you gamble the necklace away?
!
Okay stop it Laurie, I'll make you get a job.
Bye!
FEZ : Okay Fez, asking Jackie out is a big opportunity for you.
And if she says no, don't cry.
Just be witty and polite.
Stick to the script.
But most importantly speak slowly and e-nun-ci-ate.
Hello?
Hello Jackie, how are you doing today?
I'm fine nice weather today huh.
Would you like to go out to dinner with me tonight?
Okay Wait, who is this?
It's me, Fez.
Oh.
Okay.
I just thought, since you and Kelso are no longer dating How is Michael doing?
Uhh fine I guess.
Actually he seems dumber.
Well you know what, that's great.
Cause I'm doing fine too.
Just fine.
Well, if you are fine, then I am dandy.
You and me: fine and dandy!
Did you hang up?
No.
Pick you up at eight?
Fine.
Dandy!
Okay, I'm all ready so let's go.
Wow, you look great!
And you look sharp yourself, soooo let's go!
Hey, weren't you going to wear my mother's necklace?
Here it is.
I tuck it in so I won't lose it.
So, let's hit the road!
Well you know, that didn't really look like the one that she gave you.
Sure it does, it looks just like it, cause it is it!
Ahahahaha!
Now look who is getting old, doesn't even remember what necklace his mother gave me!
So let's move it out!
Boy Laurie, you really like that hotdog!
You didn't even chew it.
Oh hey Hyde, Father's Day is coming up, shouldn't you practice saying: Hi are you my Daddy?
Oh, by the way Laurie, the surgeon-general called, he wants you to stop hoarding all the penicillin.
You know, when you're in prison, your bad table manners will probably just be a turn on for some guy named Tank.
Oh maybe when you're there for a conjugal visit, you can ask him to take it easy on me.
Oh yeah well NICE HAIR!
Oh Laurie, are you all out of put-downs?
Yeah, I'm guessing I'm having an off-day.
Even Eric burned me!
Eric burned you?
!
You are totally lame.
I know, isn't that pathetic?
Eric!
What about me?
Speaking of the spinly-armed devil What's so pathetic?
Nothing.
At least nothing we can share with you Gomer.
Oh yeah well, NICE HAIR!
What?
!
So Jackie, how is your very expensive dinner?
It's great.
And I'm not replacing Michael with food!
Are you gonna finish that?
Oh that's okay.
You know this restaurant is very well know for their very expensive dinners.
But, for you, it Pass the butter!
Ahhh the butter.
That reminds me of an amusing anecdote.
Well the other day, I was in the basement Was Michael there?
Yeah.
Anyways He is SUCH a jerk.
Yes well anyways, back to my amusing anecdote.
Well the other day I was tying my shoe and Fez, I'm so glad I came out with you tonight!
Really?
Hm I was STARVING!
So what happened?
Did you kiss her?
Cause I'll kill you if you kissed her!
Ah no I didn't wanna kiss her.
I wanted to give her a napkin!
There was not a moment when she did not have a face full of food.
I was disgusted.
Really?
Hey all's forgiven buddy!
Okay fine Hyde.
You don't wanna tell me what Laurie said about me?
I'm fine with that.
I'm telling you man, she didn't say anything.
Aha.
Right.
BecauseI mean that's what Laurie's know for.
NOT saying bitchy things.
Hey Hyde, what did Laurie say about Eric?
I'll tell you later man, it's so bad!
Funny, but bad.
You got nothing.
Huh?
Yeah yeah, I got nothing Okay, fineI don't care.
She told you about summercamp right?

Did you lend it to somebody?
No.
Then what the hell happened?
!
I hocked it okay, I pawned it, I hocked it.
You pawned my dead mother's necklace?
Yes.
And I'm not sorry, cause we got groceries for it.
So I'm not sorry, I'm not sorry!
And I don't feel bad!
Oh Eric, I feel so bad!
Mom, you feel bad?
Laurie told everyone about dr.
PeePee!
Oh honey that's not so bad.
That's cute!
Oh please, I have told that story to so many MOM!
I didn't tell that story to anybody!
After I finished putting all my pictures of Michael in my special Michael-box.
I realised I'm so totally over him!
You liar!
Look at yourself!
And if you keep stuffing your face like this, you're gonna get Don't even dare say it you bitch!
FAT!
No!
Nooooo!
Yep, I've almost finished my fifth pie and I'm still completely over Michael.
No.
Stop.
Wait.
Hmmm blueberry!
Hm.
I'm feeling kinda weird Oh no!
What is happening to me?
Oh goodness!
O gracious!
Oh my!
Hmmmmm!
!
No more pie for you Okay let's go Suck it in Jackie!
My God Donna I'm scared!
I have to control myself!
Okay well then let's start by you handing Donna the jerky Back off you amazon!
Look, I just need more time.
Okay you slapping my hand when I tried to take your jerky is something a FAT girl would do.
OH!
Okay Laurie, I know what you told Hyde.
What are you talking about loser?
The camp story, dr.
PeePee, you're dead!
What is going on?
- Shh!
Pretend it's TV.
- Okay.
Well I know some pretty horrible things about you too little lady.
Fella's, Laurie here waxes her lips, legs, eyebrows, toes and shoulderblades.
In the fifth grade Eric sent away for the Charles Atlas kid, cause a girl kicked sand in his face.
- You stuffed in highschool.
- So did you.
Last year Laurie used all of her birthday money to buy a back massager.
Which isn't fooling anyone by the way Wellthat's not as bad as when I walked in on you in bed with your Dorothy Hamill poster and you were all LAURIE WAS BORN WITH A TAIL!
What?
!
YEAH.
LAURIE WAS BORN WITH A TAIL!
I HATE YOU!
!
!
It's true Okay Red, I'm very sorry I pawned that necklace.
That's okay.
I've been thinking about it and it's no big deal.
Let's just bygones be bygones.
What do you say pretty lady?
What did you do?
A few months ago, I pawned the pocketwatch your Dad gave me.
So we're even!
Let's just get on with our lives.
Oh Red how could you?
Well Kitty.
Who the hell needs a damn pocketwatch?
"What time is it?
I don't know, I'll check my pocket".
See what I mean, it's just stupid.
Oh Red.
And I pawned the lawn-mower.
And Eric's old phonographplayer and snowblower.
We had a snowblowet?
!
Actually it was Bob's.
Well why did you get so mad at me?
I got mad at myself.
Look, it's the man's job to support the family.
And if he can't do that, it's the man's job to pawn the things to feed the family he can't support!
Okay.
Okay You know, Bob's been looking for that snowblower.
Yeah I know Kitty.
And believe you me, I'm running out of stories.
So what you're saying is I slept with the devil?
Exactly.
She told me it was a birthmark.
It IS a birthmark.
From where they cut off her tail at birth!
Guys, I'm actually starting to feel a little bad about this.
Yeah it is not right to reveal other people's secrets.
I'm going to have to agree with dr.
PeePee on this one.
Hello boys.
And how are you Michael?
Well not so good, I just got some very disturbing news.
Well I hope you're very unhappy.
Fez, can I talk to you?
Yes.
Fez I just wanna thank you for last night.
I know I wasn't my supercute self, and I'm sorry.
But you're a really good friend.
But Jackie, I was hoping that perhaps we could be more then friends?
Well, hope springs eternal Fez How about you keep worshipping me from afar, and stay available.
Just in case.
You would do that for me?
That's a sweet deal.
Should we kiss on it?
Sure!
Heh!
Bye!
Allright, that's IT!
You're a dead man!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hey Mom, are you going to wear that to church or is it just laundry day?
Think about it.
No, there is an emergency at the hospital and they're really short staffed, and I'm sorry, I'm not gonna make it to church today.
Allright!
No church!
Hey, we can watch the Brewer's game!
Sounds great!
Laurie'll cook us up a couple of hotdogs, we'll NO!
No Brewers, no hotdogs, no nice day!
You're gonna make sure these kids get to church.
Why do we have to go?
!
Well I have a million reasons and no time!
Now, here's a dollar, for the offering And you remember, you sing loud, sing proud!
Hey what about you?
How come you never have to go?
Eric, God and I had a heart to heart, when I watched my destroyer go down in the South Pacific.
We're real good.
You're not.
Go!
Okay.
Well I'll see ya.
I'm going to meet some friends behind the bowling alley.
Laurie!
We're suppossed to go to church!
OH we're supposed to go to church!
Stop being such a little girl and do something bad for once!
So Eric, I did not see you in church today.
Uhh no, now that I'm not a virgin anymore there is really nothing more left to pray for.
Man, my life sucks!
Ever since Jackie left, I'm no good at pinball!
You were never good at pinball.
Let's look at the bright side on not having Jackie.
First: no Jackie!
Second: Now you can do all the things that you could never do when you were with her man.
Which was at last count, everything!
Oh man, you're right!
You know Jackie never ever wanted me to like cheat on her, or grow a beard and I always wanted to!
And now I can let this grow out!
May I grow one too?
I don't know Fez, the two of us growing beards together isn't that kinda girlie?
Well, I just figure, the more the hairier!
Oh I'm surrounded by idiots!
Hey, you know what might make our little church play work better?
If you button your shirt!
Oh and hey, what's that in your hair?
Oh, a cigarette butt.
Ah that is the last time I make out on asphalt.
Ahh there they are!
My little angels are home!
How was church?
Good sermon?
Uh you know, fine.
Jezus said something really wise People said: Oh that Jesus.
And now we go and try and live our lives that way.
You mean like a couple of uh BIG FAT LIARS?
Yeah uhm I ran into Bob out on the driveway and he told me you weren't at church.
GOD, I hate Bob!
I tried to go Daddy, but Eric wouldn't give me a ride!
Hey Mary-Magdalen, there is some gum on your neck I can't believe that my own children would do this.
Mom I mean it's such a nice day and you know we want to get some of that fresh air you're always telling us about.
Hey, nobody likes a smart-mouth sinner!
You know, this wouldn't have happened if someone had made sure his children had gotten to church WellDAMN!
Allright, from now on, you kids are going to church, that's an order.
Oh Dad Okay okay, you know what, we shouldn't have to force them.
They're almost grown-up.
They can make up their own minds.
Really?
Sureif you wanna turn your backs on God and spent eternity doing laps in a lake of fire well that's your choice Sooooo guys?
Well what do you think of the beard?
!
Yeah, it's not bad after one week huh?
I think it's stupid.
You look like a hobo.
Well you're crazy.
No, YOU look like a hobo!
- CRAZY!
- HOBO!
Yeah well I like it.
I think it looks rugged.
Look how thick it's coming in huh!
Hallo.
Well Fez, that's a nice beard!
It will be once he really comes in.
Doens't Michael look stupid?
I mean it's not even growing in right, it's all patchy.
Hahaha, poor Patchy!
Allright I don't have to take this!
Awww now we've made Patchy upset Goodbye Patchy !
So long Patchy!
I miss Patchy.
Doesn't Michael look hot with that beard?
I mean it's all rough and forbidden.
I thought you said Kelso looked stupid?
Well I can't tell him I like it!
I hate his guts!
But I hate him even more now that he is so hot.
That hot bearded jerk.
What about my beard?
It has egg in it.
Laurie, what are you doing?
Church starts in 10 minutes!
Mom, I'm not going!
What?
!
WellEric is not going either!
Oh of course he is!
Well nyou know, I thought, Mom I thought you said we had the choice?
Uhuh.
And I chose no.
But uh, yes was a close second.
You know, I don't understand this at all.
You give me one good reason why you don't wanna go to church.
- It's hot.
- It's boring.
- The music sucks.
- The pastor is ugly.
- I have to wear a tie.
- I have to wear a bra!
Enough.
What about Hyde?
I mean he doesn't have to go.
While I respect the Judeo-Christian ethic, as well as the Eastern philosophies and of course the teachings of Mohammed, I find that organised religion has corrupted those believes to justify countless atrocities throughout history.
If I were to attend church, I'd be a hypocrite Okay, you know what, I am leaving in 5 minutes.
And I'm sure you will make the right decision No, YOU'll make the right decision, and you drag her with you.
Something tells me I will not be sitting in that pew alone!
Ahahahaha!
Hey Kitty, the Pinciotti's are all here, where is the rest of Team Forman?
Oh, I'm all alone today.
All alone?
Ick!
That's just embarrasing!
That's a shame because if there's anyone who has some confessing to do, it's that dirty dirty son of yours.
Excuse me Ma'am, is this seat taken here?
Do you see anyone?
I love it here man.
The guy up there telling stories, that guys wails on the organ.
You can sing as loud as you want.
It's almost a religious experience!
I kinda think this is what heaven is gonna be like you know.
Plus, they'll have an open bar.
ST.
Right this way!
Whipe your feet please.
Sorry, no flash photogtaphy.
Next!
Oh that's us.
Forman, party of four.
ST.
Sorry, I can't let you in.
What?
All of us or just Laurie?
ST.
All of you, Hi Laurie!
Kitty, if you'd only gone to church with your family.
But you didn't.
Sodown you go!
ST.
Hahahaha, I love that gag!
Step aside would you please?
Next!
Hey there, ho there hi there!
Coming through Oh you have got to be kidding me!
ST.
What can I do?
They went to church.
Here's twenty.
Can you find us a place up front?
- Allright, that's it!
I'm kicking Bob's ass!
- Red!
Oh Kitty, we're going to hell anyway!
Well that's just not gonna happen!
Thanks man!
How was church?
Great.
I figured out what to do with our sinner children!
Kitty, our kids are fine.
Oh really?
So why is Laurie Hey, hey, if we're gonna start taking shots at our kids, let's focus on Eric.
You see, now that's the point!
He needs to learn right from wrong.
I don't want him turning bad!
Oh Kitty, I don't think Eric's gonna turn bad.
He is too much of a pantywaist!
I know why you are defending them Red.
You feel guilty because you set a bad example.
Hey I go to church.
Just not during televised sporting events!
- You know Kitty, when my destroyer went down in the South Pacific - OH!
Blablabla!
Fine.
If I thought the kids weren't going because of me, I'd go!
Fortunately I don't think that so I'm not going.
Well, that's all well and good Red, but since they won't go to church I'm bringing the church to them.
I've asked Dave, the church youth minister to come here for dinner and he said groovy!
Sounds like a great idea.
You really think so?
- I don't have to be there right?
- No.
Sounds like a great idea!
You should really go to church Eric.
Cause God, he sees everything!
So I live my life good and pure.
Kelso, you were dating two girls at the same time.
Yeah but God didn't see that.
I was in my van.
And he can't see through lead.
I don't want to get into a religious argument, but my God can kick your God's ass.
God is dead man.
It said so in Time Magazine.
No man, I sat next to God once on the bus.
He told me the meaning of life and then he gave me a pretzel.
So what's the meaning of life man?
Uhh yeah.
I guess I should've written it down But it was a good pretzel man.
Maybe this life doens't even matter you know.
Maybe we're not even here.
Or no, maybe I'm here, but you're not!
HELLO?
You know what the best thing God ever did was?
BOOBS!
Yes!
And God said: Let there be boobs!
And then there were boobs!
Hey, if God is all powerful, can He make a boob so big that even He can't lift it?
Well that's a good question man.
I'll ask him next time I'm on the bus.
Oh my God, here comes Michael!
Isn't he gorgeous?
!
Jackie, he is a dog that lied and cheated on you remember?
!
Goog good!
Keep saying stuff like that, so that I don't throw myself at him.
Gee, I'll try Oh hey.
Excuse me.
Hey Michael!
You submental two-timing dog!
Hey Jackie!
So where are you off to?
You lying-cheating-dirtbag-jerk!
Well I'm just gonna over to the Hub, grow my beard you know.
Well that's neat.
So uhm they allow scumwhat's there who lie to their girlfriends and cheat on them and break their hearts?
Uhmm..
I guess soyeah  Now I know some of the kids today think God is a real downer, but the truth is, he's an upper!
And let me tell you something, there is a much better drug then LSD or PCP.
I get high on G.O.D!
VIRGIN Bless you.
Okay, why am I here?
Because you're a young soul in my care.
Now sit dammit Sorry Dave.
I have a soft spot for virgins because they're such a challenge Religion can be cool!
In fact, Jesus was a lot like another famous rebel!
Fonzie!
But when Fonzie says: Ejjjj Jezus says: Aaaaa-men!
But Dave, could Jezus start a jukebox by hitting it?
He could, but Jesus doesn't like to hit anything.
Did He ever waterski over a shark?
Okay, does anyone have a question about the Bible?
I do.
Do you have your own place?
Hey you know what, how about we just we stop talking and we start singing songs!
DAVE : Jesus is just allright with meeeee Jesus is just allright with meeeeeEVERYONE!
Jesus is just allright with meeeee Jesus is just allright OH YEAH Jesus is just allright with meeeee Jesus is just allright with meeeee  Okay, let's take a look at your pictures.
Kitty, what do you see when you think of God?
Oh that's nice.
Very lifelike.
See, he is looking down fondly on all of us going to church.
Steven?
Very good.
I see, when you think of God you see Jesus.
No man, it's Clapton!
Oh my God man!
I drew Clapton too!
Okaycool.
Laurie?
I drew a special picture just for you Look at it later when you're alone I've got a pair of tens.
Or as we say in "Religious Rummy", a pair of apostles.
Oeh uhm, I have a jack, a queen and a king.
You mean a Joseph, a Mary and a Jesus!
Wellthat's gonna be hard to beat  That's so true Kitty.
Let's see what Laurie's got.
Six six six..
Well thank you all for the lovely evening, I'll see you at the church!
Oh Michael OH MICHAEL!
- MOM!
- HEY!
Eric, Laurie, get ready for church.
Wait a second, I thought you said it was OUR choice.
Well when you chose to go it'll be your choice.
Coming on to the youth minister, you NEED church!
Mom!
Why are you doing this?
I don't have to have a reason, it's right, I'm your mother now move.
But it's not fair!
I mean why do we have to go to church?
I mean, Dad doesn't go AH HA!
Aha aha aha aha aha!
Ahahahahaha!
Come on everybody, the Forman's are going to church!
You had to throw me under the bus with you didn't you?
!
Well nice going Eric!
Yeah nice going!
Now I have to put on a bra!
God hates me.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
How many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a toosie pop?
One Two-hoo.
Ah, screw it.
Ow, my tooth!
Oh, why did I have to bite it?
Eric, if you don't want to wear your ass for a hat, you'll get up here, pronto!
You better go.
You know how that ass-hat screws up your hair.
Poor Forman, man.
Working for Red like that.
I wouldn't wish that on my enemies.
I would.
Those suckas must pay!
Hey, Jackie.
Michael,why don't you save the sweet talk for the next idiot who's dumb enough to date you.
You know, Jackie, if you are in the market for a new lover, they say, once you go Fez, you never go back.
In my language that rhymes.
Okay, Uh-huh.
Where's Donna?
She's upstairs with Forman.
And don't follow me, Michael.
We're broken up and I mean it.
Oh, I wasn't!
And thank God we're broken up, because Damn, I miss her!
Well, golly gee, Kelso, who wouldn't?
Oh, spare me the sarcasm, Hyde.
I'm really hurting here and I'm totally lonely Man, I've seen people gut-shot who complain less than you.
Kelso, What do you miss about her ?
All she ever did was call you names.
Heck, I can do that for you.
You idiot.
See?
Aw, thanks, Fez.
No problem.
Fartface!
You know what the great thing about whistling ?
You can stop whistling!
Oh.
Sorry.
Eric, bend your knees and lift with your legs or else I'm gonna-- Kick my ass, put your foot in my ass, make my ass a hat, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Geez, and I didn't think you were listening.
Oh, and I need you to re-sticker the clock radios.
They're on sale.
Yeah, I saw the flyer.
I already took care of it.
Really?
Well, way to show initiative "Way to show initiative"?
What are you up to?
Nothing.
I just think you did a god job.
Okay.
But I'm watching you.
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late, Red.
My dog was hit by a car, and I had to rush him to the vet.
Earl, your god got hit on Tuesday, too.
How dumb is that dog.
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry, Red.
I know you gave me a break, 'cause we worked to the plant together.
And I appreciate it.
I swear it's the last time.
Earl, Why can't you be more like Eric?
I mean, He's eighteen-- Dad, I'm seventeen.
Eric, I'm talking here.
And he's got a better work ethic than you.
Oh, no doubt there, Red.
You can tell he's your son, 'cause he's just super, - Earl, just get to work okay.
- Sure, right after a cup of joe, I'm useless without my cofee.
Wow, I guess he hasn't had coffee in years, huh?
Hey, that's pretty funny!
Okay, what's up with you!
Hey, Kelso.
How's it going?
How's it going?
Great!
Just because a guy shoots hoops by himself, that doesn't mean he's lonely.
No, far from it.
Okay.
That's good.
Hey, Donna?
All this talk about being lonely kind of reminds me of me, you know?
Kelso, are you gonna get all emotional?
'Cause just 'cause I'm a girl doesn't mean that I won't totally make fun of you.
Fair enough.
I know I keep things bottled up, but under this cool exterior, there's a real sad human being.
Oh, God, Kelso, is this about Jackie?
Yes!
What gave it away?
The fact that it's all you ever talk about, you stupid dillhole.
Look,Kelso, get it through your head.
Jackie's not coming back to you.
But why?
Because you slept with someone else!
Yeah, like a month ago, God!
I just realized Jackie's short.
And I don't like short people.
They're creepy.
Always sneaking up on you.
I don't even know why I was with her.
Maybe it's because she is a tiny little whore.
Oh, I meant to hurt you, but I hurt myself because I love her.
Hey, guys, I really cracked Red up today.
And not by tripping, or getting wet, or vomiting-- Did you bump your head?
That's good stuff.
No.
I made a joke, and he got it!
At work, we're like just two guys, brought together by the common goal of slashing prices on all your household needs.
Plus, man, it's so great to see him chew out other people.
Yeah, Forman, now you know how we feel when he yells at you.
It really is hilarious.
You get all bug-eyed and stuttery.
Fellas, I've been thinking.
There are a lot of ladies out there.
And I haven't seen nearly enough of them naked.
Sometimes I am looking at naked ladies, and then I get exhausted and then I get a second wind and I am ready for more naked ladies.
It's like, at work there's this guy, Earl,he's a real screw-up right.
So Red gets pretty P.O.ed.
But that deflects all of Red's anger from me.
So I mean, Earl's like.
a "dumbass" lightning rod.
I hear ya.
I'll only work with the barely-competent.
It takes the stress out of slacking off.
Man it feels great to be free of that midget.
The world is my oyster, and I'm ready to shuck it.
Nothing but hot new ladies from here on in.
I'm gonna be boldly going where no man's gone before.
Hi, Mrs. Forman.
I'm here to pick up Laurie.
No.
No.
You mean, Eric.
No, Laurie.
Your other kid.
But, but, why?
You're dating Laurie?
That's not different, man.
You're boldly going where every man's gone before.
Steven!
It's not nice to be so truthful.
Hi, Kelso.
Did you buy me those?
Yep.
Just like you told me.
No, I told you roses.
Come on, doofus.
No offense, Mrs. Forman, but those two could make the dumbest babies ever.
That's not funny.
- Speaking of work-- - We weren't talking about work.
Work, right.
Dad and I really put in some hard hours today.
Didn't we, Pop?
Yep.
Eric really busted his hump down there.
Well, I'm just so happy my two fellas work so well together.
Hey, how's Earl doin'?
He's okay.
But his damn dog can't go a day without getting hit by a car.
At least I got one good man down there.
Right back at ya, big guy.
Well, that Earl's always been a character.
Yeah.
And today, he was late, and Dad said get to work, and he said, "Sorry, Red, I'm useless without my coffee," and then I said, "He must not have had coffee in years"!
Right, right?
Oh, that's cute.
It's not even my best Earl's joke, okay ready, 'knock knock, who's there?
' it's not Earl, 'cause he's late.
Yeah, I'm guessin' Earl's not short for early.
It's a good one Red.
I got one, The one's girl in the tucket - okay, okay Hey, Laurie, could you GET OUUUT !
!
Thanks.
C'mon, Kelso, come up to my room.
I need you to help me move my bookcase.
That means we're gonna have sex.
Yeah, thanks for cracking that code.
what are you doing?
They're going to have sex!
Get the wax out of your ears!
Man, You can't bring my sister down to the basement, this is our "Fortress of Solitude" Well, I'm sorry, but she's my girlfriend and I love her.
No, you don't.
Well, I like her.
No, you don't.
I think she is okay.
And the line between "love" and "okay" is pretty fine.
But the line between "doing it" and "not doing it," that's not fine at all!
Just like the line between "moron" and "idiot".
Exactly.
It took me months to get Jackie in the sack.
But Laurie, she already let me do it and plus, I'm over here all the time anyways.
So, there's like the convenience factor.
Kelso, my book case isn't going to move itself.
Or maybe it will.
Damn!
I gotta go!
Dumbest babies ever!
Jackie, it's great to see you so happy.
And strong.
And over Kelso.
You're like a rock.
You're like a tiny little rock.
Donna, are you trying to tell me bad news?
Or are you making fun of my butt?
- No, your butt's fine.
- Fine?
!
Glorious, whatever.
Look, uh, Kelso's dating Laurie.
I don't care.
Oh, come on,how can you still have feelings for him?
Donna, I don't have feelings for him.
I just hate that bitch for making him happy.
Oh, believe me, Jackie, she will make him more miserable than you ever did.
Oh, Donna, thank you.
I'm gonna pray to God that you're right Laurie, I have to talk to you.
Kelso, we gotta confab, man.
Okay.
Too many times, I have sat idly by and watched you make bad choices.
I've seen you screw up an awful lot.
And sure, I've enjoyed it.
But now, you've gone too far.
Do you know what this is about?
Duh.
I'm not an idiot.
Nuh-uh.
Michael has some nice qualities, but Laurie's got great legs and a fine rack, but he's just a boy.
she's a major skankoid.
And you don't know where a boy like that will end up.
And you don't know where a girl like that has been.
Now, I know you want a boyfriend who's weak and easily manipulated Now, I know you're weak and easily manipulated but you're got to learn to think about the future.
but you've got to learn to think.
And make smart choises, 'Cause, what's convenient isn't always what's best.
If it were I'd just throw on a muumuu and eat out of a can.
If it were this frozen pizza wouldn't taste like monkey-butt.
Okay.
Are you done with this little lecture?
Okay.
Are you done with that pizza?
Yes.
And I thik I made my point.
God, I gotta get my own place.
This doesn't taste like monkey-butt!
Aw, geez, Red, I'm sorry I'm late for our little meeting.
My dog uh, car got hit by a car.
Accident, that's the word.
Eric, you need to take your break anywhere but here.
Earl, you're fired.
What?
What did I do?
What did you do?
I'll tell you what you did.

Mucka zooka ho Hi, how was your day?
I had to let Earl go.
Let him go?
You yelled at him until he cried.
Hey, what kind of man cries after only fiftenn minutes of yelling?
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't like the way you handled Earl.
Dad, He was your friend.
Eric, hush shush hush hush.
Eric, Work is work.
You don't show up late, you don't make excuses, and you don't not work.
If it wasn't "work," they wouldn't call it work.
They'd call it "super-wonderful, crazy-fun time"!
Or "Skippedydoo"!
Aw, geez, why the hell am I even talking to you?
Oh, Eric, why'd you have to upset your father?
What, I can't have my own opinion without him tearing my head off?
No, and I think at your age, you should know that by now.
Well, no, Mom, no.
Uh-uh.
We had such a good thing going at work, and he wrecked it.
And by the way, without Earl, I'm back to dumbass.
He's just mean.
Oh, you shut your porky mouth, mister.
Well then, it just stinks,because you know what it's the first time that we were ever, like,you know, cool with each other.
Man, Why does he have to be such a hard ass all the time?
Oh, come on, Eric.
That's how he expresses himself.
That's always how he's expressed himself.
Your father yells at you because he cares.
Yeah, right, well, if that's true, then Stand up straight.
You're a dumbass.
You call this a report card?
Hands above the covers Oh, I guess he really really cares.
And if not you're moving out soon.
So you know who I hate?
Laurie.
Oh, Jackie, I know you are upset and in pain, but you're not going to talk during the Hollwood Squares, are you?
Well I mean, I really do hate her.
No offense, Eric, but your sister's a slut.
Oh, my God, Jackie, not since the "Smokey versus Bandit" debate have you and I been so on the same page.
Yeah, I think we're all on board.
Oh God!
This is so great.
You guys all hate Laurie and love me.
Yeah we all hate Laurie.
Shush!
Oh, great, Lambchop had a joke, and I missed it!
Hey, guys.
Oh, Hi, Michael.
Kelso, as your new girlfriend, I'm really not comfortable with your old girlfriend hanging out down here.
Okay.
Jackie, do you mind?
No.
I don't mind if you leave.
She's not leaving.
Well, I'm not either.
She's not either.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Hey, this is my house.
So what?
Eric wants me here, don't you, Eric?
Why, yes I do!
You better watch your back.
Really?
cause you shouldn't spend so much time on yours.
Oh, burn!
Hey, I'm Sorry, I just got swept away by the super good burn.
Shut up!
Jackie, that was an excellent burn.
Thank you, Fez.
Now, please sit next to Fez-- --Move it!
What the hell were you doing in the shower so long?
You know, it wastes water and I might be late.
In fact, I'm definitely not gonna be the first person there.
You know how that makes me look?
Damn it, you gotta grow up and learn some responsibility.
I love you, too, Dad.
Stop being weird.
Thanks.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Oeh!
Now I've got Park Place and Boardwalk.
T his game is just like life!
I am the richest of all.
Jackie I've got ninehundred and seventy dollars here, it's all yours if you just GO AWAY!
Relax Forman.
It's better then having Laurie down here.
She's like a big cancerous tumor.
And Jackie, she's like a tiny benign cyst.
Thank you Hyde!
Here, buy yourself a hotel.
Why are you giving him money, I'm the one in jail, does Hyde punch me in the arm.
Why can't we start over?
Because Aiiiii.
And don't try tipping over the board again either!
Next time we go hiking make sure you bring a blanket.
I think I have a twig in my shorts.
What a coincidence, so does Kelso!
BURN!
Okay, okay, nice burn.
Hi Jackie.
Oh look it is Michael and his community chest.
Nice!
So Michael, when you come over for dinner tonight, don't wear that stupid unicorn tie.
OH!
Oh I'm sorry Jackie, was that a gift?
Oh yeah?
!
Well, were those shoes a gift?
Because they're ugly!
What are you even doing here anyways?
Shouldn't you be off playing with ribbons and ponies?
Well shouldn't you be off being a bitch?
Oeh I made the little girl say a bad word!
See you tonight Woops Laurie makes me SO mad!
I just wanna rip out her hair, show it to her and hope it doesn't grow back.
I hate her.
Jackie, that's what she wants.
She feeds on your anger man, it only makes her stronger.
Well then what am I supposed to do?
If you really want to get under her skin, you have to be Zen.
Zen?
Okay, you can't just make up words Hyde.
No, man, Zen.
At peace, aloof Zen Okay then, Hyde, will you teach me how to be Zen?
You can't just teach someone to be Zen Jackie, you can only learn to be Zen.
Okay, I don't understand.
Exactly.
And that's your first lesson.
Huh?
!
Jackie, if you wanna be my student you need to follow my instructions.
Without question.
Okay okay, see, I can do that.
Okay.
First thing, finish polishing my boots.
- Okay Hyde, how is THAT gonna help - WHAT?
Okay!
You make a fine student!
Shine Grasshopper!
Shine!
Kelso, man you're not seriously coming to dinner tonight are you?
!
Why shouldn't I?
You know, Jackie broke up with me and I needed a girlfriend and Laurie's it.
And plus I need to eat, soI'm coming to dinner!
Yeah Kelso, you're lame.
And you're sad.
But if you go to dinner with Red, you're gonna get your just deserts.
I don't really care what they serve I just wanna be there for Laurie you know.
Hope it's pie!
Oh Kelso.
It's gonna be SO bad!
Can I come to dinner tonight?
No.
Look, Red loves Laurie right, and Laurie likes me.
Therefore, Red has to like me.
I mean, what father wouldn't like the guy who is nailing his daughter?
Oh Laurie you can't bring Michael to dinner!
Are you out of your mind?
Mom!
I'm an adult, and this is my choice.
No, if you were really an adult, you'd try to meet someone with a future, instead of Michael, who, bless his heart, is probably gonna end up ripping tickets at the Tilt-A-World.
Well he could invent something!
Yeah, I guess I'm lazy.
Uhuh.
And Laurie, have you given any thought to what you're gonna say to your father when he finds out?
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND DADDY AND WE LOVE EACH OTHER AND YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM BEING TOGETHER!
What do you think?
.
Laurie I absolutely forbid you to bring that boy to dinner!
OH!
Sometimes I hate you!
Well, that is just too bad because I love you!
Because I have to Whatéver No, more aloofness!
Whatever I'm not believing you.
Hyde, when are we going to move on?
I have been saying 'whatever' for half an hour!
You can say very much by saying very little, small Grasshopper.
Pretend you're Laurie and insult me.
Okay  Hey Hyde!
Youre stupid!
Whatever  - Wow that was great!
- Yeah!
Now, another part of this is ambiguity.
Say it with me..
Ambiguity!
Very good.
See, you dont want people to know exactly what you mean.
Here, ask me if I want to go to a movie tonight.
Hey Hyde, would you like to go to a movie tonight?
Thats cool.
See, you dont know if I mean Thats cool - Ill go or Thats cool  no thanks.
- And thats cool?
- Whatever  Oh my God!
I am so sorry I got impatient!
Thats cool.
Hey guys.
So Jackie, Eric wont invite me to dinner tonight.
So do you wanna like go to the mall or something?
Thats cool.
Wait, what do you mean?
Oh my God it worked!
I mean  whatever  Hi guys, sorry Im late What?
You guys started eating without me?
!
That is SO rude!
I'm just kidding!
Hahaha!
Ahahahahahaa!
Well Eric, you must have forgotten to mention that you invited Michael to dinner tonight?
Oh right.
Uhhh yeah I guess I did!
Oh and there are my chocolates, the chocolates that I asked you to bringover to me.
Oeh Fanny Farmer!
No no, those are for Laurie!
Kelso, what the hell are you doing here?
!
DAD!
Err..
nougat?
Don't worry Red, I got something for you too!
Huhh!
FIVE beers?
Uh yeah, they were all out of sixpacksWeird huh.
Let me help you out with that there Red!
Are you taking a beer?
!
HEY FOCUS MAN!
He's dating your daughter!
Laurie, what's going on?
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND DADDY!
And he loves meandhe's good to me and we're happy together Kelso, you have five seconds to get as far away from me as possible.
But Red, what about our unspoken bond?
ONE!
TWO!
I'll call you Beer Red?
And the rest of dinnerwas eaten in complete silence.
The only sound was the dull throbbing of that vein in Red's giant shiny head.
Boy, I'm glad I'm not Kelso.
Sure he's had sex a lot and I'm still a virgin but OH I wish I was Kelso.
No you don't Fez.
Being Kelso is likeknowing the truth behind all the deceptions of society but not being able to convince any of your fellow suburban clones that anything's wrong man!
No wait, that's me.
Man, I just totally forgot why I was laughing!
Isn't that funny?
!
Okayno more for the cheerleader okay?
Jackie you seem different.
I don't know if it's your hair, your outfitor your red puffy eyes..
She's Zen man.
I've taken her under my wing.
I'm running a dojo of coolness.
Jackie, demonstrate.
Oogly-googly.
Oogly.
Yeah, It's her first day Kitty I don't want our daughter dating that kettle-head!
Well maybe it's just a phase.
Nohe's been a kettle-head since No no, I meant Laurie.
This is how it starts you know.
First they're dating and having fun and then the next thing you know they're prying the money to pay for a wedding from my cold dead hands.
Oh honey, they're not gonna get married!
He'll leave her when she gets pregnant.
Ahahahahaha!
Oh.
Okay.
I see Mr. Smiley isn't in town today I expected more from her.
What the hell is she doing with some highschool kid?
She went to college!
Well she did flunk out.
Oh Kitty.
I can see how their future is gonna turn out and it's not good ROBOT-FEZ : More mashed potatoes Red?
Why thank you, ServaTron 2000 Well that's cold!
Damn foreign robots.
Oh it's so nice to have dinner with the family like this.
Yeah it's a good thing we found a babysitting droid for the quintuplets.
So Michael, how is the jobhunt going?
Great!
You know, they had a real short line at the unemployment office so I got home in time to catch the end of the Spaceprice is Right.
You know, times are tough for me and Kelso right now.
You'll help us won't you Daddy?
I'll always be there for you honey.
I think she means financially Red.
I know what she means.
Kettle-head.
You're giving us more money, right dude?
Yes dammit.
Allright allright.
Hey Laurie, I think it's time for our 'nap' Allright!
That's it!
I've got to go to Saturn on business for a week.
Now when I get back, you better have a job or it's off to the asteroidmines for you!
ROBOT : Don't forget your briefcase Red Thank you ServaTron 2000.
Now, roll back the roof, cause I gotta go.
Jetpack blast off!
Red!
Red!
That's it.
I'm just gonna tell her that she can't see him anymore.
No no, you can't do that Red.
In fact the more we fight it the more she's gonna want to be with kettle-head.
Ah at this rate I'm gonna have a heart-attack before I even get my jetpack.
You know, I missed you guys.
Yeah this place just isn't the same when I'm not around.
Oh hey.
You guys wanna hear a really funny story?
I was just upstairs, and Red was yelling at me about you.
And uh then I said: what are you doing yelling at me, Kelso is right downstairs.
In fact.
I'll go get him for ya I said!
Say that is a funny story!
I don't care.
I'll talk to Red.
He was really mean to me, and here I'm brought him a fivepack.
So I hope he is ready to apologize.
Oooohhh yeah.
Yeah that's it.
If there's one thing Red's about, it's forgiveness No he's not.
He's the opposite of that!
Oh wait.
I get you!
Funny!
Wait uhh Red, can't we leave that open?
Have a seat Kelso.
You know, I've been thinking a lot about your "relationship" with my only daughter.
She's a gem.
Shut up.
Kitty says that if the two of you want to see eachother there's nothing I can do about it.
But she's wrong.
Cause I could kill ya.
That's a joke Kelso.
You should laugh when I make a joke.
Huhuhhhey good one Red See you're making me think that I should take a personal interest in you.
And you don't want that.
Take Eric for example.
I have a personal interest in him.
Oh God.
There you go.
What you wanna do here, is fly in under my radar.
So that if I never see you and Laurie together, or hear your name mentioned in the same breath I might just forget that you even exist.
Got it?
Yeah.
Okay so you mean if me and Laurie UH now, see, you just mentioned my daughters name.
I'm sorry.
Okay uhh, if Kelso and your daughter No no no no, see that's not gonna work either.
Well this is hard Red!
Well you gonna be here till you get it right Kelso!
Well okay Red, but eventually my parents are gonna come looking for me.
Yeah, but they're not gonna find ya!
Well that's another joke!
Come on, laugh Kelso!
Oh you again.
What happened, did they let out kindergarden early today?
Whatever.
Jackie don't you have a lame comeback, saved for just this very occasion?
That's cool.
Ohhh so now you're little miss Cool huh.
Whatever.
Well, if you're really as cool as you think you are, you would have been able to hold on to your one true love.
But you couldn't, could you?
Loser!
Oh well.
Catfight!
!
You guys stop it!
!
OWWW!
You bit me!
Jackie hit her in the eye!
!
Oh I know!
We can throw water on them and then we can see through their shirts!
BITCH!
!
You kicked her ass man!
Yeah yeah, whatever Oh my God, I'm so turned on!
I can't believe Laurie bit me.
I hope she didn't give me like slut rabies.
Jackie, you're my hero!
You hit her in the eye!
Yeah, but I guess it wasn't very Zen of me, was it Hyde?
Well, where Zen ends ass-kicking begins.
And that's your final lesson, Grasshopper.
Hey man, let's do that thing where we all sit in a circle again The fact, that you actually went into garage with Red, that's so brave.
Yeah,I guess we both have to fight for our love baby.
- I'm coming to the living room now - Dough Well, hi there kitten.
Hi daddy.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Okay.
You guys I just got an advance copy of the yearbook and you'll all be happy to know that 1977 is my cutest year ever.
Jackie, that is so weird because I was just telling the gang how there's no way you could be cuter than last year.
- You were?
- Yes.
I, for one, totally believe that you are cuter this year.
Yeah, since I dumped you.
Nice burn.
Donna, we've talked about that.
Hey, Steven.
Want to pop some popcorn and look at all the yearbook pictures of me?
Nah, I figure I'll do plenty of that when I die and go to hell.
God, you're such a card.
This is so exciting.
My first American yearbook.
Show us some pictures of Fez.
Sorry, Fez.
There aren't any.
What the hell?
So, they don't let foreigners in your yearbook?
Uh-huh.
Here's me cheering at the pep rally last fall.
Oh, my God!
Someone in the crowd is mooning.
You're all cheering away, and the whole time you're getting mooned.
Yeah!
Oh, my God.
That's a girl butt.
Hee-hee.
There's girl butt in the yearbook.
Oh, man.
I can't tell who it is.
I wish we had a magnifying glass.
Oh.
Here you go.
I I was just playing with some bugs.
God, I can't believe it.
Someone's nasty butt is in my picture.
Oh, my God.
That's not girl butt.
- That's Donna's butt.
- Yes, it is!
Eric.
Are you okay?
'Cause you look weird.
Yeah.
Could it be because of your girlfriend's naked butt?
- Kelso, you're not helping.
- I'm not trying to help.
Eric, it's no big deal.
It is too, Donna.
Your nasty butt ruined my picture.
Hey.
Maybe your nasty face ruined my butt picture.
I know why I'm not in the yearbook.
It's because whitey's keeping me down.
Hey, Fez.
Just look at Donna's naked butt some more.
Yes, that's nice.
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay.
Donna, take me through the chain of events.
Now, uh, you're at the pep rally Oh.
And at this point your pants are on.
Right.
And then they weren't.
Donna, mooning's not something you just do.
No.
It's not something you just do because it's impossible to moon when you have no ass.
Michael is such a boy.
He doesn't even know who he is.
You know who knows who he is?
Steven Hyde.
Oh, no.
Now you like Hyde?
No, I don't like him.
I just I just think he's, like, the sweetest, coolest guy I've ever met.
Jackie, I thought you hated him.
Feelings change, Donna.
Like, remember when we first met, and I hated you?
- What?
- Yeah.
I thought you were, like, this big goon.
Didn't we have this talk?
No.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I mean, I hated you too.
Yeah.
That's 'cause you were a big goon.
- Bitch.
- Goon.
- Bitch!
- Goon!
See?
See, we're closer then ever.
I gotta go find Steven.
Oh.
Hello, strangers.
Look, Red.
It's the Pinciottis.
Yeah.
And they're dressed the same.
We were jogging.
So you had to dress the same?
Well, I hope we're still on for cards tomorrow night.
Oh, about that.
Uh, we can't Hey.
No excuses necessary.
Gosh.
Darn the luck.
That just makes me so sad.
I gotta go inside.
Well, me too.
Um, Midge, is something bothering Bob?
Oh, he's uncomfortable around you and Red now that Donna and Eric know each other.
If you know what I mean.
You see, I'm using the word "know" in a different way here.
Uh-huh.
It's a pun.
It's not a Okay, Midge.
Good pun.
Bye-bye now.
Oh, they are nuts.
Yeah, there's a lot of things about Steven that I used to not like that now I really like.
Like Well, I thought his pork-chop sideburns were a sign that he was poor and dirty and lived in a shack.
But then But then I realized that Elvis had sideburns, and he lived in Graceland.
Well, that was an eye-opener.
There he is.
Hi, Steven.
What's she doing here?
I think she's hitting on me, man.
But I ain't interested.
Tell her I ain't interested and make her go away.
Hitting on you?
I'm not hitting on you, you relic.
Hey, name-calling's no way to win someone's heart.
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Great.
Now he got away.
Steven!
What was she talking about?
Man, I don't know what's gotten into Jackie.
"Steven, let's hang out.
Steven, let's go to the mall".
My life's a living hell, you know.
Steven, you're hilarious!
You know, Steven and I tease each other.
That's what best friends do.
You know what?
I love showing my butt!
I don't care what Eric says.
I like to show it, and I like to shake it.
Donna, I can totally respect that.
Just be careful, though, or they'll call you a home-wrecker.
I can count the number of homes I've wrecked on one hand.
Don't worry, ladies, 'cause no one's gonna label you here.
If you guys want to take off some clothes and shake some stuff, feel free.
Not you.
I wouldn't call you a home-wrecker, Laurie.
No, I'd call you a slut.
And a home-wrecker.
Shake, shake, shake Shake, shake, shake Shake your booty Whoo!
Rock it, girl.
Yeah.
That's good stuff.
Hey.
Let's see a smile.
After all, no card game with the Looney Tunes tonight.
Red, they are the only friends we've got.
I am having them over tonight, so we can clear the air.
No.
No, no.
I don't want to clear the air.
Red, I'm clearing the air.
Kitty, this is our chance to grow apart.
How can you throw that away?
How?
Because six nights a week I have to stare at your sour puss and even God got to rest one day a week.
- Hey.
- Hey.
So, the yearbooks are out, and no one's noticed your fleshy indiscretion.
So I guess I'm cool with it.
What a relief.
I tossed and turned all night.
Well Relax, Donna.
Relax.
Because, I mean, it's a tiny picture.
It's all out of focus.
I think it's safe to say this little episode is behind us now.
Hey, everybody.
Donna showed her ass!
Donna showed her ass!
Donna showed her ass!
Donna showed her ass!
Donna showed her ass!
Okay.
Um We've been friends and neighbors for a long time and, um, I think there's something we need to talk about.
- Don't you, Bob?
- Nope.
Kitty, don't push him.
He might just get up and leave.
I'd respect you if you got up and left.
Eric and Donna are having sex.
- What the hell?
- Kitty!
I didn't know that "clearing the air" meant we were gonna have a sex talk with the neighbors.
I did.
And I thought it was gonna be fun.
And it is fun!
I think what Midge means is it's good to clear the air.
Secrets cause cancer.
Fine.
Bring it on.
Just so long as I don't have to talk about this.
I gotta say I'm with Bob on this.
Right.
So let's all just not talk.
Okay.
Deal.
Okay.
Deal, buddy.
No, Bob.
Deal.
You lose again, cracker.
Why don't you go home and cry to your big white mama?
Well, first of all, dude, I think I'm Chinese.
And second of all, let me see you put your money where your mouth is.
I don't know.
Twenty bucks.
I'm gonna have to dip into my babysitting money.
I mean my drag-racing money.
Time to lose, little white girls.
Score.
Ah.
Hey, I just remembered, man.
I'm really good at this game.
Ooh, Steven.
I'm so glad you're here.
Jackie, please.
I'm right in the middle of "Smokey and the Band-Aid," okay?
Okay.
Fine.
But I signed us up for roller-disco lessons at Skate World tonight.
Class starts in half an hour, so we better hustle.
You get it?
"Hustle"?
Okay, let me explain something to you.
On Friday nights, I don't roller-disco.
I go out looking for roller-discoers to punch in the head.
Okay.
Fine.
We won't roller-disco.
We'll do anything you want.
No.
We won't.
Look.
Man You and I don't have anything in common.
You're, like, a square, you know?
A A cheerleader.
So, just roller-disco on out of here, okay?
Fine.
Fine.
I guess I'm not cool enough to hang out with you anymore.
Now you're getting it.
You know what, Steven?
You think you know me, but you don't.
You don't know me at all.
I know you like unicorns.
So, bye-bye.
Oh, my God.
Call Walter Cronkite.
My girlfriend has her pants on.
Okay, you're behaving like the biggest baby.
What's your problem?
What's my My problem is it's your butt.
It's our butt.
It's my butt.
Eric, it's my butt.
And when I showed it, it was funny.
And you should be glad that you have a girlfriend who's cool enough to moon.
Well Yeah, okay.
I mean, you're right, but You know what?
Once the jocks and the guys with the Firebirds see it you know, they're just gonna totally want you.
Oh, no.
With my weak-willed girlie mind, I'll go too.
You're such a bonehead.
Yeah, I know.
Okay, it's great.
But, you know, in the future would it kill you just to have a smidgen of modesty?
Oh, my God.
What What's so funny?
You're a prude.
I am not.
Yes.
You're uptight.
You're like a little pilgrim.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
In the end, I'm glad my Donna's with your Eric.
At least I know Eric's not a degenerate.
Who's the prude now, huh?
My ass is swingin', baby!
Whoo!
Eric.
Hi, Mom.
So.
Bob, uh, you want to go ahead and cancel next week's game, buddy?
Okay.
It's a tie game.
This is it, Fez.
Channel all of your hatred for the white man into this one last point.
I am full of hate, my brother.
Hey, foreign guy.
Will you sign your yearbook picture?
My what book picture?
Oh, my God.
It is half my face.
Oh, I feel the warm, loving embrace of the whitey.
I forfeit.
You win.
No.
No, no.
No one is embracing you, Fez.
You're brown, okay?
So let's kick some racist ass!
We lost?
Nice game, my white friends.
You owe me money!
Hey, Hyde.
Oh, no.
Is the roller-disco craze over already?
Of course not.
Look.
Hyde.
I just wanted you to know that I'm not a square cheerleader.
I'm on the wrong side of the law.
Because I have this.
Oh, no.
A paper bag.
Run.
Jackie.
Oh, yeah.
I bought it in the ghetto.
Jackie, there is no ghetto here.
I mean, there's, like, that one house that needs to be painted.
Okay, fine.
I bought it from my housekeeper.
Whatever.
So, what are you saying?
You want to be like a burnout now?
No.
No.
Hyde, I just want to be with you.
Okay?
I think you're one of the coolest, sweetest guys I've ever met.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
Is there a problem here?
No, sir, Officer.
There's, uh There's no problem at all.
- Right, Jackie?
- There's nothing in the bag.
Okay, miss.
Let's go.
No, no.
I can't go to jail.
I have to cheer tomorrow.
What are you doing, man?
The bag is mine.
Come on.
Cheerleader, dirtbag.
Okay, man.
Oh, my God.
Steven Hyde, you were right.
We will never be friends.
We'll be more than friends.
Because now I love you!
Oh, my God.
Would you shut up?
As God is my witness, I will wait for you.
Well, I hope you're happy.
I don't think Bob will ever recover from the sight of your rear end.
What rear end?
What I can't figure out is how you expected to run away with your pants down around your ankles.
Damn.
He's dumb.
Hello.
Steven, where have you been?
You missed the funniest damn thing.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Pants around the ankles?
Oh, that's great.
Look, Red.
I gotta talk to you about something.
Arrested?
For what?
For possession of what?
Son of a bitch!
Hyde got arrested?
For what?
- For holding.
- For holding what?
For holding my heart.
- Because I love him.
- What?
It's true.
Okay.
I love Steven Hyde.
And someday he'll love me.
And he'll cut off those stupid sideburns, and we'll live happily ever after.
What?
