{START OF EPISODE 1}
Oh, Lord, help me, no!
Pardon me.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, no disrespect, man but you got to watch where you parking that thing.
Man, you know, get some flashing lights or some horns or something.
I'm gonna just go ahead and shut up now.
You've been sitting on this couch all morning.
A little bored?
- Oh, no, man.
I'm cool.
- Mm.
What you reading?
A postcard from Carlton.
He's doing something with his summer.
"Dear Big Guy.
Thanks a lot for sending me to Young Republicans Camp.
Yosemite's really neat.
Hey, I'm rooming with Newt's nephew, Fig".
I wouldn't make fun of them.
These kids are the future leaders of this country.
Come on!
Come on!
Yeah!
All right!
Yeah!
You know why you're bored, don't you?
You miss your cousin Carlton.
Pfft.
Ha!
Please, me miss Carlton?
Pfft.
I forgot all about him.
Did he say when he coming back?
Hi, everyone, guess what.
Wolfgang Puck is coming on my show on Monday.
We're doing a cooking segment together.
Ha, ha.
Miss Hilary in the kitchen?
You know what?
That's cool, Hil.
What say we go hook something up now?
I'll help you practice.
Help me cook?
You must really be bored.
Hey.
So is everything ready for Judge Walker's dinner tonight?
- To perfection, sir.
Ha, ha.
Oh, don't forget to put up the plantation shutters, okay?
I've been bragging about your cooking to the man.
Ha, ha.
Hey, hey, can I come?
Can I come?
- Unfortunately, yes, you will be there.
- Cool.
The whole family will be there.
He's gonna make his decision about who is to preside over the Show-Biz Madam Trial.
Ew.
She's so scuzzy.
I mean, it's bad enough that she gets hookers for married men but blue eye shadow?
Hello.
Yeah, you know, that is a little stank.
Hey, G, imagine a dude so desperate that he'll pay for sex.
Imagine that.
In any event, this is a career-making case so I thought it'd be a good idea to have the judge over and - Kiss his butt?
- Exactly.
And I expect all of you to be on your best behavior.
Do I make myself clear, Will?
Yo, I'm gonna be cool, Uncle Phil.
It's a couple of these other rabble-rousers you need to be worried about.
This is perfect.
I can prepare for my show by watching Geoffrey cook dinner tonight.
Oh, dear God.
Guys, I need help.
I'm gonna rehearse with J.L. and I can't decide what to wear.
- I really like this one.
Ah.
Well, the only way you're gonna wear this one is if you wear that one over it.
Hey, Ashley, come on, you don't need J.L. to help you.
I'll rehearse the play with you.
God, Will, you must be really Bored!
Yes.
Yes, I'm bored.
I'll do anything with anybody.
Now, somebody ask me to do something.
- I'm gonna go practice my swing.
- I have better things to do.
Geoffrey, call the club and confirm our foursome with Judge Walker and his wife, please.
- Sir.
Whoa, a foursome.
You're getting a little freaky in your old age, huh, Uncle Phil?
Coming, Vivian.
Hey, hey, Uncle Phil.
You know, this is your last chance to make that a fifthsome.
Call me from the country club, all right?
You know the number.
He'll call.
But, Geoffrey, you have to teach me how to flambé.
If I don't learn I'm gonna look stupid on my show.
I'm afraid that ship has sailed.
- Hey, come on, G, I wanna flambé.
- Will, this is a private lesson.
Geoffrey can't be bothered trying to teach a moron to cook.
Right, Geoffrey?
- Come on, G, come on.
- Now then, let's flambé.
First, you sprinkle this liqueur over the bananas and then light it with a match.
Oh, yo, I could do that, G. Come on, let me light the bananas, man.
- Because all I gotta do is - Out, Master William.
Whoa, who, whoa!
Let me light the bananas.
Out!
All right.
You light it.
- Voilà.
- Ha, ha!
Oh!
Hey, come on, come on.
I can do that, G. Voilà.
Come on, man, you gotta let me try that.
Voilà.
I never knew bananas were so flammable.
WILL : I'm going to kill you, you little spider jerk.
Hey, yo, G. G, come on, I'll let you be the green dude this time.
Dang.
Just up and leave without saying nothing.
Tell me I can't do the flambé.
Voilà.
I can't flambé.
Ooh.
Ha, ha!
Voilà.
Ha, ha.
Shoot.
Oh!
All right, all right.
Stay down!
Down!
Down!
Voilà in reverse.
Oh, dang!
Get down!
Stop it!
Stop it!
And I'm telling you that Waterworks and the Electric Company are depreciable assets.
I don't care, you still have to pay a luxury tax.
My dad will know.
Hey, hello?
Hello?
Hey, Carlton, look, I can't talk right now.
The kitchen's on fire.
I'm burning the house down.
My house is on fire.
I have to leave now.
Toro!
Toro!
All right.
Oh, man.
Oh.
Whoo.
Ah.
That was close.
That was close.
Oh, man.
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.
I almost burned the kitchen down.
Oh, no!
No!
Auntie Em!
Auntie Em!
Mama, no!
Our work here is done.
You okay?
No, I'm not okay, man.
How could I do this?
It ain't like I ain't done some stupid stuff since I been out here but how am I supposed to explain this?
Son, just how did this happen?
I had a little accident cooking the flambé.
Flambé?
You torched your uncle's kitchen cooking flambé?
Black folks ain't supposed to cook flambé.
You stupid.
Hey, guys, sissy boy been cooking flambé.
I hope I've been of assistance to you.
Good evening, Master William.
Of all the rooms to burn in your uncle's house.
The kitchen.
Are you mad, boy?
G, G, I'm telling you, it was an accident, man.
Remember I came in here and I watched you poof the flambé?
I had liked it.
So then, I came in and I had poofed.
But I poofed big.
Too big.
And I poofed the kitchen down.
G, Uncle Phil's big dinner is tonight.
Hey, hey.
Man, look, you gotta help me fix this.
- Good day, Master William.
- G, G, where you going?
I had a night of work ahead of me in this kitchen but now, as you can see, there is no kitchen.
Farewell.
- G, hold on.
- Cheerio.
G, wait a minute.
G!
Listen, Uncle Phil is gonna kill me.
You gotta help me.
- No.
- G. G. All right.
All right.
If not for me, then do it for Uncle Phil.
If Uncle Phil sees this, he's gonna blow up in front of the judge and that is gonna wreck his chances.
All right, G, I made a mistake.
I made a big mistake.
But it is my mistake, not Uncle Phil's.
He shouldn't have to suffer for it.
Look, all I'm asking you to do is just help me get through this dinner.
Just one night, G. I'm begging you, man.
Please.
- No.
- G!
- All right.
All right.
- Hey, thanks a lot, G. All right.
Look, I'm gonna go upstairs, I'm gonna see if I can find a restaurant that'll deliver.
Why don't you stay down here and see if you can pine solve this little problem here?
- Where you going?
- Los Angeles.
- Hop in.
- Oh.
Phew.
Thanks for picking me up.
I left my wallet at the hotel.
Couldn't get a cab, there are no planes or buses.
Phew.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Yeah.
I'm glad to see you too.
Halston?
Whoa, this is my stop.
- Excuse me.
I'll be right back down.
- Okay.
Well, it's a shame your wife couldn't join us for dinner.
- Why?
- Uh Hey!
Hey, look who's back from golfing.
- Will, this is Judge Walker.
- Hey, nice to meet you, judge.
What is that smell?
Uh, well, uh, don't look at me.
You the one been out there swinging them golf clubs all day, you know what I mean?
No.
Mesquite?
Barbecue.
Phil, are we having barbecue?
Is there something barbecued back there?
Uh, yeah, you could say that.
Why don't we walk back there and see what is cooking?
Aah!
Ha, ha.
Hey, uh, what, spoil the surprise?
- Will.
- No, he's right.
I wouldn't dream of interrupting a chef at work.
That's right.
Hey, listen.
Uncle Phil, why don't you show him the library?
Man, Uncle Phil got some books.
Britannica, Webster's, Playboy.
Whoo.
- Man, we dodged that bullet that time, G. - We?
Isn't that a pronoun that would include me?
You know, that little attitude of yours isn't helping anything, G. Man, you Got the food.
Oh, my God.
Ashley, all right, hold up.
All right, hold - How did this happen?
- He did it.
- Does Dad know?
- No.
Oh, he's gonna kill you.
All right, that is exactly why we cannot let him see this till after the judge leaves.
Because murderers, they're felons, and felons, they can't be judges.
Kind of get where I'm going with this here?
So this is our little secret, me, you and Geoffrey.
Oh, my God.
- And Hilary.
So what I'm saying is, there shouldn't be a rich or poor.
We should all just share the wealth, man.
Oh, I beg to differ.
Stanley, we didn't get a chance to discuss this much on the golf course but have you given any more consideration to the Show-Biz Madam?
Phil, have you ever eaten at that little Hungarian place down by the courthouse?
They have a delicious goulash.
Could I, uh, trouble you for some water?
No trouble.
Where's Geoffrey?
I'll get him.
What are you doing?
Uh, just trying to be helpful, Daddy.
Hey, listen, why don't y'all just relax?
I'll get everybody some water.
I'll get some water for everybody.
Ha, ha.
Wouldn't it be simpler if you just got a pitcher, Will?
Good thinking, Uncle Phil.
Excellent judgment, you know what I'm saying?
He got good judgment.
Ain't that just like a judge?
He a good judge.
G, what is taking so long?
I don't know.
Lack of a kitchen?
Look, I need a pitcher.
Ah.
All right, cool.
The best fried chicken in town is this joint two blocks from the courthouse.
Will, what is this?
Oh, uh That's just a little mineral water.
Go ahead, it's good for you.
Drink up.
You know, they make it two ways, extra crispy and extra spicy.
But I can't take the extra spicy.
Lord knows I love it, but it doesn't love me.
Ah.
Excuse me for, uh, just a second.
lxnay on the Indian food.
Judge can't take spicy.
- Come on, don't just stand there.
Help me.
- This is insanity.
I want no part of this, Master William.
You have gone too far.
If I got to hose down some poultry to pull this off, that's what I'm gonna do.
Are you with me?
Oh.
Red or brown?
G, red or brown?
Don't make me choose.
Red or brown?
Ooh - Brown.
- All right.
And the next thing I know, I'm on this train heading for home.
So all in all, this has been the most bizarre night of my life.
Do you ever wonder what makes your skin stay on?
Bon appétit, mesdames et messieurs.
- Philip, how about a toast?
- Oh.
Just make it quick.
It's getting cold.
- To warm food.
Ha, ha.
Hear, hear.
Hmm.
Mm.
Oh, sweet mama.
Now, that's chicken.
I've said it before and I'll say it again.
Show me a man that knows good food and I'll show you a man of good judgment.
And you, Phil, are a man of good judgment.
Yes.
But before I congratulate you, I wanna congratulate your chef.
No.
You know, I think we all should.
Oh, but, Daddy Daddy, Geoffrey's so shy.
Oh, we'd just embarrass him.
Hey, you know what I think we all need?
A nice brisk walk around the block.
- Come on, who's with me?
Oh, yeah.
Have fun.
Let's go.
Uh, uh Please, have a seat.
Yo, Geoffrey!
Ha, ha.
How was your dinner, sir?
Oh, incredible.
You are a magician.
Oh, you're too kind.
It was nothing.
No more trouble than ordering in.
Oh.
You're much too modest.
Oh, thank God you're all right.
- Carlton?
- What are you doing here?
When Will told me the kitchen was on fire I didn't know what to expect.
What?
- Um  We had a little mishap in the kitchen earlier, but - Oh!
- It's cool, though.
It's cool, though.
- What in the world?
- Oh, my God.
You were able to prepare a magnificent meal like that in there?
I think if I could steal you away, I would.
Please, hold that thought, sir.
Uh, Uncle Phil, I can explain.
Now, son, well the most important thing is that you're okay.
What?
Things can be replaced.
This is a special family.
Vivian.
Philip.
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
And this man will have you on the Supreme Court in no time.
Uncle Phil?
You gonna let me go anytime soon?
No, Will.
That's cool.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Will.
Will, would you hurry up already?
If you think you can do it any faster, then you come in here.
Oh, stop your squawking.
We only have 15 minutes to do this.
Hey, look, I just ain't trying to be out there looking stupid, all right?
Let's do this.
And action.
Hi.
As the king of poultry, I know what good chicken should taste like, and if you Hold up, Carlton.
Wait a minute.
A chicken eating chicken?
That's just sick.
Hilary's gonna need her stage in five minutes.
- Oh, for crying out loud.
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, girl.
What's up?
How you doing?
Hey.
What part of the chicken you like?
Excuse me.
Break it up.
You, out.
Big Bird, back to work.
I don't know why I'm doing this dumb mess in the first place.
Because if you don't, I'll fire you from the Peacock.
You'll drop out of school and be wrestling for scraps with a guy named Joe in the dumpster behind the Sizzler.
But, hey, you have to live your own life.
Hi.
As the ain't-got-no-damn-choice king of poultry  Cut.
I am not experiencing happy chicken here.
- Now I'm a happy chicken.
- Wait a minute, where are you going?
- We haven't finished shooting the ad yet.
- Look, Carlton.
I've had it, man.
I'm 20 years old and I'm in a chicken suit.
You know, I'm just sick and tired of doing these stupid jobs.
With all due respect, Will, you're not exactly overqualified.
Read my beak: I quit.
Wait a minute, you can't quit.
Get back here.
I'm your boss.
You better get back here.
Will, you better - Come back to the set.
I'm done, no.
- I need you on the set.
What's going on?
It's him.
He started it.
Hill, do you have any job openings?
I don't know.
Ask Werner.
He's the producer.
- Well, do you?
- Uh As a matter of fact, we've been looking for an assistant talent coordinator.
It's a lot of hard work, but there's room for advancement.
All right.
Assistant talent coordinator.
Hey, I mean, I can assist.
I'm talented.
Definitely coordinated.
Hey, Carlton Banks here.
I'm Hilary's brother.
I've been considering a vocational change for some time now Whoa, whoa, wait.
What are you doing here, Teeny?
You already got a good job.
This is a better job, so step aside.
Anyway, as I was saying You know, guys, I make it a rule to stay clear of all domestic disputes.
So, uh, Hilary?
- Hilary, I never asked you for nothing.
- Okay, you're hired.
- Yes.
- Whoa, wait a minute.
What about me?
I'm your brother.
Okay, then you can have the job.
Ha, ha.
This is easy.
- Hilary, you just said that I could - Okay, then you can have the job.
- But you gave me the job.
- I'm getting a headache.
Werner?
Handle this, please?
I've worked in management for two years.
I can type 100 words a minute, I take shorthand, speak French and Spanish.
I'm pre-law with a 4.0 average.
And you?
Well, you know, I mean, I don't like to brag - But?
- Oh, that's it.
I just don't like to brag.
Pay no attention to him.
He's a chicken.
But it was your idea for me to be in this stupid suit.
That's right, you've got it.
Ha, ha.
He's a follower not a leader.
No, sir.
I'm your man, Werner.
Listen, why don't we go grab lunch and you can bring me up to speed.
You know, you remind me of myself.
I used to be an entry-level butt-kisser too.
Jazz, I'm telling you, man.
I would've been perfect for that job.
That big Blow Pop head swindled his way in and took what was mine.
Damn.
That's even worse than getting beat up by a girl.
But anyway, this ought to cheer you up.
"Come get your freak on at Club Freak On".
Took me a long time to find something that rhymed with Freak On.
- Hey.
Hey.
- Oh, well, well.
MC Steal-a-Job is in the house.
Do I detect a little hostility, Will?
Sour grapes perchance?
Face it, you couldn't handle the responsibility of a real job.
It's not who you are.
Leave the handling of the likes of Maurice Perry to professionals.
Maurice Perry, the comedian?
The one and only.
He's gonna be here any minute with Hilary and Werner to talk about the possibilities of being on my show.
- Your show?
- It's only a matter of time.
Anyway, we're gonna need the house.
So if you two don't mind Even if you do mind, go away.
- Master Carlton, your guest has arrived.
- Hey, look here, Thumbelina Pay no attention to my unemployed friend here.
You really ought to bring Maurice past the club tonight.
I'm sure he wouldn't be interested.
Besides, I have the pleasure of escorting his sister around town tonight.
Oh, two of y'all can fit on a Big Wheel?
You were funnier with your beak on.
That's it.
Beak on.
"Come get your beak on at" Shut up.
Then this Chinese guy comes in and says, "Supplies.
Supplies".
Oh, that is so funny.
I don't get it, but you are so funny.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.
I've always enjoyed your comedy.
I'm somewhat known for my bon mots myself.
Excuse me, Bonbon?
We're not finished talking yet.
Maurice, this is my cousin.
Although we never really did a background check.
Oh, please.
Sit down.
Sit down.
This is a business meeting.
Why don't you go back into the kitchen and play with your future cell mate?
So, Maurice, Hilary and I just wanna thank you for giving us the opportunity to sit and chat a bit.
Now, we're syndicated in all primary markets now and we're scheduled to expand Oh, speaking of schedules, Carlton.
The clinic called.
You're still on for your implant tomorrow.
Anyway, heh, our demographics at the moment are very similar to Ooh, Carlton, what is that on your lip?
Will, there's nothing on my lip.
Oh, nothing but the rotting residue of the lies you told to steal my job.
For God's sake, Will, accept it.
The better man won.
Yeah?
Well, the bigger, badder man's about to beat the better man into oblivion.
Hello?
- Sorry, Hilary, but this just has to be said.
I've had about as much lip as I'm gonna take from you.
You think you can do this job?
You think you've got the stuff to handle high-profile celebrities?
You think it's easy catering to a low-rent Martin Lawrence wannabe?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Pardon me.
Pardon me.
I don't have to sit here and be insulted by some black Potsie Weber.
I'm out of here, okay?
Werner, do something.
Oh, Will, this is all your fault.
All right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey.
Maurice, hold on, hold on.
Hey, listen, man, this really doesn't have anything to do with you.
You kind of drifted into a no-fly zone.
Look, Potsie don't know what he talking about, all right?
Look, you are all of that, and the truth of the matter is Hilary's show is really cool, the audience is growing every day and you'd have a great time doing it.
- I don't know.
- Hey, look.
Come on, man.
I'm telling you.
The honeys is buzzing around there like a straight-up beehive, you know?
- You know?
- All right, I'll do the show.
All right.
But keep the Smurf away from me.
- That's doable.
You're fired.
- Aah!
Will, you're hired.
Did you hear that?
You're fired and I'm hired.
Did you hear the rumor that Carlton was fired and Will was hired?
A court date has been set for the long awaited trial of Tanya Baine the infamous show biz madam.
It is rumored that Miss Baine's pricey call girls counted some of Hollywood's top leading men as clients.
The high-profile case has been assigned to the prominent Judge Philip Banks who was shown here this morning leaving the courthouse.
I'm not to talk right now.
It would jeopardize the case.
- No, I'm sorry.
Thank you very much.
One more question.
Please, if you could answer one question.
You know, it's true what they say, TV really does add 10 pounds.
Hmm.
What would account for the other 250?
You know, you're not a man who enjoys employment, are you, Geoffrey?
- I thought you looked wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Let's go in the kitchen and get some - Food?
Ha-ha-ha.
Shut up.
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
Well, I'm off to study.
Don't stay out too late.
It's a school night.
Ooh.
I'm sorry, Ashley.
Whoa.
Studying, huh?
What is this, your geometry dress?
Ellen wants to borrow it.
Oh.
Well, if it isn't the wise-cracking, job-taking, sister-stealing slug himself.
Whoo!
Who's sucking on them sour grapes now, huh, Carlton?
I mean, sure, you lost your new job and you can't get your old one back but we've all got problems.
Look at mine.
I've got to take out a famous comedian's beautiful sister and I'm out of Binaca.
But you don't hear me crying, do you?
Will, promise me you'll be on your best behavior tonight.
- Hey, aren't I always?
- I'm serious.
It's really important Maurice appear on my show.
Everything has to go smoothly with his sister tonight.
All kidding aside, I know how much this means to you, and it means a lot to me too.
- I'm not gonna let you down.
- Okay.
Thank you.
May I present Miss Jasmine Perry.
Now, which one of you handsome men is Big Willy?
He is.
Mm.
I'm ready to get my freak on.
Looks like you already got it on.
Listen, uh, you wouldn't wanna go someplace you know, that was a little quieter, you know, maybe darker?
You're a little ahead of me, Big Willy.
But I'm game.
Let's do this.
- Whoa, whoa!
Aah!
Wait.
- Let's go.
You know what?
On second thought, I think this place will be just fine.
Aah!
Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?
Oh, no, it's my stomach.
I probably should've waited about an hour before we danced.
You know what?
You know what?
I should take you back to your hotel.
Whoo!
Hey, girls, here I go.
All right.
- Where's the troll?
- Oh, I put her back under her bridge.
No, man, I dropped her off at the hotel.
Ready to kick off round two.
Whoo!
Ding, ding!
Why don't you hurry and write your number down before I don't want it no more?
Come on, let's dance.
Hey, what's up, Ash?
Ashley?
Oh, Will.
I can explain.
- I can't explain.
- Weren't you supposed to be studying?
Oh, well, we did study, really fast, and then we came here.
You are learning entirely too much from me, young lady.
Oh, Will, it's just ginger ale.
Come on, let's get something to drink.
You're not gonna tell, are you?
Behave yourself.
- You too.
Hey.
Hey, you wanna get a dance off?
Why don't you get Maurice something to drink?
Whoo!
You like that, huh?
Oh!
Oh!
Hey.
Hey, look who's here.
- Where's Jasmine?
- Who?
Jasmine.
Oh!
You said, "Jasmine," I thought you said, "Jazz, man".
- Will, you dumped her, didn't you?
- Hey.
Hey.
Don't go conclusion jumping You knew how important this was.
How could you do this?
- But what had happened was - You gave me your word.
You're right.
I'll take care of this, Hill.
Excuse me.
Oh, man.
Hey, G, did Jasmine call?
No, I'm afraid not, sir.
I don't believe this.
She's not at the hotel.
She's not at the restaurant.
I don't know what to do.
If she tells her brother that I dumped her, ain't no way he's gonna do Hilary's show.
I cannot believe that I blew this.
First time I have a chance to prove that I'm not a joke and I am.
Perhaps you might enjoy a bowl of soup, sir.
Miss Jasmine brought it by for you.
She was here?
Why didn't you say she was here?
You asked if she called, sir.
G, come on, man.
Where is she?
I don't know.
I believe Master Carlton took her to Club Freak On.
Why would he do that?
Don't know, don't care.
Oh, I get it.
He's trying to steal his job back, and he's using Jasmine to do it.
Ooh!
Jazz, did you see that girl I was here with earlier?
Come on, man.
I'm still trying to forget.
Stop playing, man.
Where is she?
Gone.
Boy, you got it bad.
- Ashley.
- Yes, Daddy?
How was studying?
Um, fine.
You know, the funniest thing happened.
You're never gonna believe Uh-huh.
Will a week cover it?
Better make it two.
Two's good.
Aah!
So did you do it?
Well, I hope you're happy now.
You know, you got what you wanted.
I'm out.
You're in.
- Is that about it?
- No, sir.
I have only begun.
See, you know what kills me?
I was laughing while I was walking home because it's funny.
You know, how we can live together all these years, almost like brothers and you could still low-bridge me the way you did.
- Are you about done?
- Oh, no, sir.
- Furthermore, you little - Snake?
Weasel?
- Oh, yes.
- Nerd?
- Oh, yes.
- How about square-headed short stack?
This is not the way this is supposed to be going.
You're mad at me for stealing your job?
Right.
You shouldn't have done that.
You knew how much I wanted this job.
And you demonstrated that by ditching your responsibility, Jasmine.
Who may not be a looker, but is quite an entertaining gal.
Look, fine.
Be that as it may, it does not change what you did and what you always do to me.
Man, you are just so selfish.
You got everything, but on top of that you gotta take everything that everybody else has.
Always about you.
Carlton.
Carlton.
Carlton.
- You know what your problem is?
- No, I don't.
You're a slacker.
You say you want things but you're never willing to work for it.
You never make the sacrifice.
You think you're just gonna charm your way through.
Just like your father.
Let me tell you something.
I am nothing like my father, all right?
And I didn't steal your job.
What are you talking about?
Jasmine came by to see how you were feeling and I covered for you.
Her brother's gonna do the show.
Really?
Well, why'd you do that?
I thought you wanted that job.
I did.
But honestly, I thought you're better for it.
Yeah?
And besides, the Ivy League looks down on the entertainment industry.
You had a great opportunity to split my wig tonight, man.
You usually don't pass up opportunities like that.
I thought it was time for a change.
Damn, man, you gonna be making changes in our relationship, you gotta let me know.
I could've been down at the club, you know.
There's some hundred percent USDA prime choice down there.
I could be tenderizing right now.
Tenderizing as we speak.
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
Look, I'm sorry about that, all right?
Hey, you're gonna find something that's bigger and better.
I have no doubt.
- Hey, I owe you, man.
- Believe me, we're even.
- No, no, no.
I owe you.
- Trust me, we are definitely even.
Oh.
Listen, I'm tired.
Can you get that for me?
Oh, yeah, no problem, buddy.
You know what?
I gotta think of something real fly to do for Hill too.
Get me and her back even again.
Carlton was right.
It was only a three-and-a-half-hour virus.
I can't wait for you to take me to Santa Barbara for the weekend.
I hear they have nude beaches.
Carlton!
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
There.
Finally, this family's gonna start eating healthy.
What do you think?
I think it's too good to be wasted on the hired help.
- Hey, hey.
Good morning, Aunt Viv.
- Oh, my.
Look who's dressed up for his first day at work.
You look nice.
Come on.
Don't sweat me, Aunt Viv.
Don't sweat me.
Don't sweat me.
Give them back.
Hey, Carlton.
Look.
I don't know what you talking about, man.
All right?
Carlton, what are?
Carlton!
Carlton, what are you doing, man?
Carlton!
What is going on here?
I got my job interview in a half hour at the bank and Will's wearing my argyles.
Carlton, get off.
Get off, man.
You want your stupid socks back you can have them.
Probably ain't gonna help my foot fungus anyway.
Keep them.
- Morning, Ashley.
- Good morning.
Has anyone seen my black leotard?
That ain't funny.
Philip, you think you'll be home late?
Probably.
Jury selection's taking a lot longer than we thought.
Could even spill over into tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Daddy, tomorrow's Career Day.
You're still gonna speak, right?
- Don't worry, Ashley.
I'll be there.
- Oh, okay.
Wait, wait.
Hold up.
Hold up.
Hold up, Ashley.
Y'all having a Career Day?
I mean, why you ain't asked me?
I'm sure all the kids at school wanna know what an assistant talent coordinator does.
Well, what do they do?
What do they do?
I'm gonna get back to you on that, Ash.
- Breakfast is served.
Oh, good.
Good.
I think I'll pick up something down at the courthouse.
- I'm sick.
- Me too.
- I'm sick.
I'm sick.
I'll get something at school, Mom.
Hilary, how you doing?
Oh, how does it look like I'm doing?
My throat is sore.
My eyes are dry.
Every bone in my body aches.
And my nose is so clogged up I can't even smell my Obsession.
Great.
You'll be ready to meet Mr. Stimple tomorrow.
- Mr. Dipple?
- No, no.
Not Dipple.
Stimple.
That's what I said.
Dipple.
Right.
The guy we're trying to get to sponsor our show.
But I can't do it tomorrow.
I'm almost dead.
Well, if you don't do it tomorrow the show will be dead.
Hey, excuse me, man.
I was wondering if you If you If you could Excu Excuse Excuse me, sweetheart.
Could Could Could you?
Catch up with you at the commissary, baby.
All right?
Hey, hey.
Werner, what's up?
Hey, how you doing?
Listen, I just wanna say how great it is to be here and I wanted you to know that l I'm ready for anything.
Whoa, you are a tiger.
I like that.
Rawr.
Great.
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, let's see.
Anything.
Anything.
We do have something important going on.
- We have a potential sponsor coming.
- Oh, great.
- Everything must be perfect.
- Perfect.
I'm your man.
- We really want to impress this guy.
- Impress him.
I am with you.
What you need me to do?
Take him out to dinner?
Show him the town?
Anything.
Actually, I need you to move those boxes.
Boxes.
- Boxes?
- To the Xerox room.
Boxes.
Hey.
But listen, you know, after I do that I think I'll be really ready for some serious responsibility.
Don't worry.
Soon you'll have more responsibility than you can handle.
All right.
Who ordered a Chinese chicken salad?
How's the jury selection going?
Oh, it's exhausting.
We're still four jurors short and I don't know if This isn't gonna keep you from coming to school?
Well, if we don't find them, we'll just go with whatever we have.
Geoffrey, make me a sandwich.
- May I remind you, sir - No, you may not.
Just make me a sandwich.
As you wish, sir.
I don't mean to brag, but you're looking at the next junior executive at the California International Bank.
Well, they hired you on the spot, huh, son?
Well, they haven't actually hired me yet, but their body language was pretty clear.
Body language?
Sure.
They gave me the wink and the gun.
You know.
When they give you the wink and the gun that means: "Hey, you're our man".
- Hey, hey.
What's up, guys?
Hey, Will.
How did your first day go?
Oh, it was great, Uncle Phil.
Listen, after I got finished changing light bulbs and moving boxes they gave me something important to do.
I moved a big box.
Well, that's the problem with menial jobs, Will.
You're at the mercy of someone else's whims.
Now, if you'd have taken a more executive corporate-like endeavor such as myself then you'd be your own man.
Not sitting around like some puppet waiting to be beckoned.
That's them.
That's them.
Hello?
No.
She's not here right now.
She'll call you tomorrow.
Ashley, call Felicia tomorrow.
What did you do that for?
I need to keep the line clear.
- I'm calling her upstairs.
- Oh, no, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
Who put you in charge?
I did.
I am Carlton.
You are not - I'll talk to you later on, Uncle Phil.
- You know, Will my first job was in a law clerk's office.
It was the summer of my freshman year in college and I thought I was  all that.
Anyway, I spent most of my days making coffee and copying legal documents.
And that was before Xerox machines.
Dag.
Who was your boss?
Mr. Slate?
He was on The Flintstones.
Go ahead, uncle.
Well, the point is one day I decided to take some initiative and make myself more important to them.
You know, it worked.
- Hm.
Initiative, huh?
Yeah.
Your sandwich, sir.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
What is this?
Tofu and rice cakes.
I tried to warn you.
Mrs. Banks has run amuck.
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey.
Now, if you'll go to my office and look in my desk Gone, sir.
- My pimento loaf?
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- But I still have some bologna in the - She got that too, sir.
Man, Aunt Viv got skills.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, what do you say we slide down to Mickey D's before she clean them out too.
- Initiative.
- Yes, sir.
Yes.
So do you think that you could render an impartial verdict in accordance with the law?
Oh, I know I can.
I must.
I've been ordered to.
Ordered?
By whom?
Alex Trebek.
I'd like to thank our guest, Mitchell Conklin for sharing his heartbreaking story of a life with no friends.
Well, Mr. Mitchell Conklin I'm your friend.
Come back tomorrow for more of me.
Hilary.
And we're out.
- I'd just like to thank you for - Not now.
Great show.
Ew!
Could somebody please get me a Kleenex?
Oh, look at me.
I'm getting all puffy.
- Werner, what am I gonna do?
- Well, I It's done, Hil.
I just I just went and I got her some medicine.
You know, I took a little initiative.
Initiative.
I like that.
You know, thinking ahead will get you ahead.
Little story.
When I started Hello?
Aren't I the patient?
Shouldn't I be getting all the attention?
Will, why don't you go help Hilary relax?
Oh, yes, sir.
Oh, hey, I just wanted tell you.
I'm really starting to feel like part of the team around here.
Heh, heh.
Don't ever touch me.
Just gotta learn the rules, man.
Just gotta learn the rules.
Mr. Jackson, why do you think you'd make a good juror?
Because I could always tell if someone was guilty just by looking at them.
Sir, even I can't tell by looking.
And they let you be a judge.
My brain is all clouded.
My head's all fogged up.
And I can't think straight.
And now you've got a cold on top of it.
Will, just fix it.
Here you go, Catwoman.
See?
You getting better already.
- Soy meatloaf, madam?
- Yes, Geoffrey.
I am through serving that fat-filled cholesterol-ridden mess.
Say what you will, but he is a good provider.
I knew that's why they didn't call.
Geoffrey, I told you no calls.
- Master Carlton, I was just - Damn you and your excuses.
Sit down and relax.
You're right.
Geoffrey, I'm sorry.
Touch that and you'll be on the first thing smoking back to London.
Carlton Banks' office.
Please hold.
Carlton Banks here.
Oh, hi, Dad.
I thought it was someone important.
But I can't.
I'm waiting on a phone Fine.
- Is everything okay?
- Dad's still interviewing jurors.
I've gotta go to Ashley's school and tell her he can't make it.
Look, if anyone calls just give them my cell phone number.
Thanks.
Keep the lines clear.
Certainly, Master Carlton.
Whoops.
Hey.
Yo, Hil, Mr. Stimple's here to  Well, what do you know?
It's Uncle Cousin Will.
Oh, I feel much better.
That was some good tea.
I love you.
Hil, Hil, Hil.
Hey, come here.
Come here.
Come here.
Wait right here.
"Use only before bedtime.
Do not operate heavy machinery".
Good thing we're not on a tractor, huh?
Ha-ha-ha.
Hilary.
Come here.
Come here.
You gotta get yourself together for your sponsor.
Oh, Mr. Pimple?
Bring him in.
No.
It's Mr. Stimple.
Bring him in too.
The more the merrier.
But we're gonna need some more tea.
No.
Ah, ah, ah.
I think you missed the last call.
Come on, walk it off.
Walk it off.
I'm a little teapot Hilary.
Now breathe, breathe.
You are not trying here, young lady.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
Walk it off.
Oh, Will.
You're tickling me.
Stop.
Werner is wondering what's taking so long.
Candace, hi.
Have you met my cousin, Will?
Isn't he cute?
Uh, uh - She had too much medicine.
- Ha, ha, yeah, right.
Wait.
Hey.
Hey.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Now listen, you go down there and you stall Werner and Mr. Stimple.
- All right?
I'm gonna take care of Hilary.
- Okay.
But wait a minute - Hilary.
- Hilary go night-night.
I can't believe this is happening.
Dad promised.
Buck up, Ashley.
Life is filled with disappointments.
I am the only person who doesn't have a speaker.
I'm gonna look like an idiot.
Once again, Carlton Banks to the rescue.
When do I go on?
No.
No.
Carlton, it's Career Day.
You don't even have a job.
If you don't want the next junior executive at the California International Bank Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
I'll go tell them to introduce you.
Carlton Banks' office.
Please hold.
Carlton Banks here.
Oh, yes.
The job, of course.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Huh?
But I don't understand.
You can't give a guy the wink and the gun and then not give him a job.
Buck up?
Buck off.
Our next speaker is Ashley's brother, Mr. Carlton Banks.
And here is where we hide our star.
Hey.
How you doing?
You must be Mr. Stimple.
How you doing?
I'm Hilary's hair designer, Diante.
Pleasure.
Oh, why didn't you tell me he had such lustrous hairs?
Oh, excuse me.
I'm doing girlfriend's hair.
She is so excited to meet you.
Just later.
Well, I'd kind of like to meet her now.
Uh, Hilary, I've never seen the program.
Do you stand and interview a guest, or do you run all around like Donahue?
Oh, listen.
Hilary can do it all.
You know, she can stand.
She can run.
You know, she's like Ricki Lake and Oprah and Donahue all wrapped up in one.
Around here we call her, Ricki-Oprah-hue.
Very clever word play, but I'd like to hear what Hilary has to say.
Oh, see, she like real shy.
You know, she can't really verbalize with you till she gets to know you.
You know what I mean?
Of course.
Where's my head?
Fred Stimple.
Stimple Rubber.
Pleasure.
Oh, no, you don't.
Honey, it took me an hour to do them nails.
You a Leo, ain't you?
And in conclusion, if you follow these steps as I have outlined then I guarantee you'll be successful.
Thank you.
You still haven't told us what you do.
Well, I was previously in expeditious comestible management.
And currently, I'm overseeing a myriad of options.
Do you even have a job?
Well, strictly speaking, l He's a bum just like my Uncle Eddie.
Excuse me, sir.
Are you really a bum?
Back off, sister.
- You got an attitude problem.
- Damn right I've got attitude.
Just wait till you grow up.
You'll see how tough it is.
There are sharks out there and you're all little guppies waiting to be devoured.
Sure, you can lie back in your protective little womb called high school and pretend the world is your oyster.
But one day it's gonna turn on you like the rotting milk in your stinking lunchboxes.
Thank you.
You know, with a touch of henna and a kiss of ash blond you're gonna need yourself a beeper, girl.
Diante, you're a very unusual man, but I grow tired.
-  Who are you?
- Aah!
Who am I?
I'm Mr. Stimple.
Stimple Rubber.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Stimple.
Will.
Will?
I thought you were Diante?
Diante?
There's a good explanation for all of this.
Save it.
This has been, uh, different.
Excuse me, Mr. Stimple.
Um, I'm sorry.
Mr. Stimple.
Look, my name is not Diante.
My name is Will.
I'm Hilary's cousin.
Now look, this is all quite simple, Mr. Stimple.
I'm sorry.
Listen.
Look, my uncle told me I should take some initiative.
I got nighttime-so-you-could-sleep instead of daytime-so-you-could-think medicine.
Man, how is she supposed to drive a tractor?
So I said, "Aah"!
And, you know, she said, "Aah"!
You know what I'm saying?
- You're Hilary's cousin?
- Exactly.
This is the worst day of my life, Mr. Stimple.
I'm so sorry.
No need to apologize.
I know all about nepotism.
I got a factory full of idiot nephews and worthless brother-in-laws.
With only one moronic cousin running around you're way ahead of the game.
He said, "Moronic cousin".
Ha, ha.
Hey.
Hold up, man.
Fine.
I understand your having to work.
I even understand you missing Career Day.
What I don't understand is how you could possibly send Carlton.
I mean, you could've sent Mom.
You could've sent Geoffrey.
You could've even sent the pool guy.
He answered the phone?
I understand you taking initiative.
I even understand the tea.
But what I don't understand is how this happened?
Uh, see, well, you bobbed when you should've weaved.
PHIL &  Sorry.
Dinner is served.
- I'm sick.
I'm sick.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on!
Now, we have to do this.
Oh, sure.
Now our responsibilities kick in.
Look at you.
I can't believe you're acting like this.
All I'm trying to do is look out for everybody here.
Honey, don't you wanna live longer?
Don't you wanna feel better?
Last one to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles ain't eating.
I understand there were other applicants.
I even understand I was too young for the job.
But what I don't understand is they gave me the wink and the gun.
They gave me the wink and the gun.
Buck up, pal.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
What the heck is that?
It's a fiber shake.
I've got an interview with an old Princeton chum of Dad's.
I need to be strong.
I need to be alert.
And I need to be regular.
Ain't nothing in the world gonna make you regular, man.
- Good morning.
- Geoffrey, are my sandwiches ready yet?
Philip, for God's sake, we're going to SeaWorld.
There's gonna be food stands everywhere.
That may be true, Aunt Viv, but there ain't gonna be no food stand in the Volvo.
You better let that man eat and give him food or he'll mess around and chew one of your arms off in the car.
Carlton, I had a talk with Frank Bradley this morning from Princeton.
- You ready for your big interview tomorrow?
- Am I ever.
I've been enhancing my résumé all week.
I applied for a job at Dole headquarters.
And yesterday, I went down to the rec center to become a Big Brother.
Now, why you go and do that?
You certainly ain't big, and as far as being a brother  Well, I've already planned what I'm gonna wear.
I've got my argyles, my wide-wale cords and my lucky sweater.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Master Carlton, about your sweater, we've had a dryer mishap.
Don't worry, Carlton, it'll shrink.
It's just a small setback.
I still have the canary-yellow one.
I forgive you, Geoffrey.
Banks residence.
Oh, yes, certainly.
- For you, Master Carlton.
- Oh, thank you.
Hello?
Yes.
It's the rec center.
Uh-huh.
All right.
What?
I can't be a Big Brother?
They didn't like me?
Well, you tell those little brats I don't like them either.
Will, this sweater will work for my interview tomorrow, right?
Uh, that depends, are you going as Archie or Jughead?
Hello?
Dole headquarters?
No, man, we don't want no pineapples.
Give me that.
Carlton Banks here.
Huh?
What do you mean I didn't get the job?
Budget problems?
But I was volunteering.
Hello?
Hey, Carlton.
Carlton.
Hey, it's cool.
Relax, man.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Hey, look here.
National Geographic, huh?
Special issue.
The ladies of the Sudan, you know what I'm saying, huh?
How much more bad luck can I have?
I mean, face it, Will Princeton will never accept me.
I've got nothing to offer.
Hey, hey, Carlton.
Now, hold on.
You stop that.
Now, come on.
You got plenty to offer.
What are you talking about?
You got You got the See what I'm saying?
From before, you still got You still got - Give me a hand here.
- Ugh.
Carlton, Carlton.
All right.
Hey, look, I just saw it in here.
You got your grade card.
Yeah.
- Princeton is about academics.
- Yes.
- And I am second to none.
- Ha!
You got that right.
Mama, no!
Hey, what's up, G?
Another Village People reunion?
As it is my weekend off, I've decided to head for the Circle M Dude Ranch.
There's nothing like the feel of an animal beneath you to recharge your battery.
I know what you're talking about there, G. No, I'm afraid you don't, Master William.
But I do find it rather endearing when you think you do.
Have a nice weekend.
Have fun at the "dude ranch".
Oh!
Hey, Ashley?
What's up?
That's right, 8:00.
Sure, bring whoever you want.
Music?
Are you kidding?
Of course.
There's gonna be wall-to-wall music.
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
What do you think you're doing, young lady?
My parents are away, I have the house to myself.
I'm having a party, duh.
- You - The whole world's having a party.
Hey.
What's up, C?
Oh, dear mother of God.
This can't continue.
What's wrong, man?
Would you look?
Red, yellow, brown, green.
That's the way I understood it to be.
But now, blue.
Has the world gone mad?
They're just M&M's, C.    The blues Okay, that's enough of that.
Come on, man.
Now let's see that big Carlton Banks smile, man.
Come on.
Will, I wanna be alone.
I told Uncle Phil I was gonna look out for you.
Come on, gotta get it together.
You got that big Princeton interview tomorrow.
- Oh, whoever it is, tell them to go away.
- Ah, ha, ha.
Not so fast, man.
I got a little surprise for you.
Now, nothing makes a brother who's feeling down feel better than seeing somebody who's in worse shape.
Huh?
I called up Stinky McGuire.
Yeah?
Stinky's here?
I haven't seen him since high school.
Seeing him would cheer me up.
I mean, he was always such a loser.
He was even shorter than me.
Well, bring him in.
Hey, Carlton.
Party, dude.
Come on, man.
Come on.
Oh, we gonna have some fun, man.
We gonna get some strippers or something.
We gonna have a ball.
Come on.
Will, I'm not in the mood for this.
Oh.
You not in the mood for this, huh?
Well, look here, too short if you wanna sit around and wallow in the stench of your own self-pity then you go right ahead.
Will, you don't understand.
Oh, no, I understand, you big baby.
"My sweater shrunk.
My grades are low.
My head is too small for my body".
It is?
Oh, shut up, Carlton.
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.
I am not gonna sit around here with your stank-robe-wearing, slipper-shuffling résumé-polishing, little-kids-don't-like-me blues.
Now, I'm about to go out and I'm gonna get me a 16-piece nugget dinner.
And when I get back, I wanna see a new attitude, mister.
And for God's sakes, clean yourself up.
- Whoa, hey.
Yo, Ash, the cops are outside.
- What?
- No, no, I was just kidding.
I'm playing.
- Will, what are you doing?
I gotta get barbecue sauce.
Dude tried to play me down there.
You know, they give you the same amount whether you get six or 16.
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is my cousin, Will.
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, hey.
Roar, watch it, girl.
Ah-ah.
You can look, but don't touch, baby.
- Get your sauce and nuggets and get out.
- All right, all right.
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Make sure you stay friends with that one in the pink, you know what I mean?
Couple more years of seasoning, you know, put a little barbecue sauce on her let her marinate, you know what I mean?
- Oh, get out.
Get out right now, Will.
Ashley.
Hello?
Hey.
Uh Uh, yes, sir.
Hold on one second.
Carlton.
Carlton!
I'm sorry, can I take a message?
I'll have him call you right back.
Oh.
Oh, yes, sir.
Absolutely.
All right.
Carlton, dude from Princeton called.
He had an emergency.
He has to do the interview tonight.
Carlton!
Where the hell are you at?
Dear Will, you were right.
I shouldn't be burdening the family with my low-down, whiny-mouth sniveling, M&M-eating, feel-sorry-for-myself blues.
P.S. My head is too small for my body.
Nobody loves me but my mother And she could be jivin' too Now you know why I act funny with you, baby When you do the things you do I'm home.
Ashley, Kyle has been here for half an hour.
Are you gonna meet him or not?
Yeah.
No.
Wait.
- I thought this was the point of this party.
- Yeah, it is.
Just give me a second.
Okay.
Like, one one-thousand.
- Kyle, come here.
- What are you doing?
What's up, Kee?
Ashley, this is Kyle.
Kyle, this is Ashley.
She's been dying to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you, Ashley.
Great party.
This is nice.
- Really?
You think so?
- Mm-hm.
Well, I have parties all the time.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And your parents don't mind?
Mind?
Ha!
They practically write out the guest list.
Wow, I wish my parents were that cool.
Ash.
Ash.
I think that guy is calling you.
- Don't worry, he's part of the cleaning crew.
- Oh.
Ash.
It's so hard to find good help.
Excuse me.
- What do you want?
- Ashley, Carlton ran away.
- Great.
- Wait, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, I'm being serious.
Now, I've been calling around.
I don't know where he is.
We gotta go find him.
No, Will, I'm having a party.
I'm carefree, understand?
Free of cares?
How's my hair?
How are my lips?
Do I look okay?
You look beautiful, Ashley.
Thanks.
Now get out.
"How's my hair?
How's my face?
How's my stuff and my other stuff"?
Hello.
Ugh, yeah, yeah, thanks a lot.
Yeah, I'll be right down to pick him up.
Hey, somebody called me about picking up my cousin Carlton?
Yeah, we get a runaway yuppie down here every week.
He's over there at the bar throwing back ginger ales.
Eddie, it ain't gonna fill itself up.
Carlton.
What are you doing?
- Will, how'd you find me?
- Never mind.
We're going home.
Come on Hey, Carlton.
All right, look, the alumni guy from Princeton called.
He's coming tonight.
I can't do it, Will.
I just can't handle another disappointment.
This is where I belong.
- Ain't that right, Tiny?
- Shut up.
Yeah, we're brothers of a tortured soul.
We support each other.
Take Sach over there.
Better yet, take Pappy.
He's been telling me about riding the rails.
You hear that, Will?
Riding the rails.
I mean, I don't have a clue what he's talking about but darn if he doesn't make it sound exciting.
Okay, I want you to get into the car, okay?
Will, you couldn't possibly understand.
I mean, how could you?
You've got everything.
You have the job, you have the girls, and damn it, you've got the height.
You don't know the blues.
How could you?
Oh, heh.
- Oh, I don't know the blues, huh?
- That's right.
Yeah, like everything's been perfect for me.
You know, like growing up in the projects.
Growing up in the projects Never having any money.
Ain't never had a dime Never knowing whether my father was gonna come home.
He left and he ain't come back yet Excuse me, Pappy, why don't you take a nappy?
Listen, I am not about to stand here and argue with you about who has it worse.
The fact of the matter is neither one of us has it that bad.
But this is your last chance to get into Princeton.
If you wanna blow that, you go right ahead.
What were you doing?
No one's allowed in the bedrooms.
Hey, relax, Ash.
- We're just taking a little tour.
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?
- I gotta get up tomorrow and go to practice.
- But the party was great.
Thanks, I had fun.
- You had a good time?
Good.
- I had a real good time.
- Cool.
Okay.
Excuse me.
Ugh.
- Maybe I'll see you again?
- Yeah, we should hook up.
Oh, wait a minute, um, I don't have your number.
Yeah.
We're gonna have to get you some school supplies.
Bye, Ashley.
- Bye.
- All right.
Oh, no, no, no.
Not in this house.
Get out.
- And what do you think you're doing?
- I'm just having a smoke.
Not here you're not, idiot.
Could somebody turn down the music?
Carlton, I really appreciate your willingness to change your schedule.
Well, changing is one of my strong suits, Mr. Bradley.
As you know, your father and I were classmates at Princeton.
He was quite the big man on campus.
He's even bigger now.
Ha-ha-ha.
- Yeah, well, aren't we all?
- Oh!
Ha-ha-ha.
I was very impressed with your application.
Particularly cogent was your essay on the fall of Eastern Europe.
Mm.
If you like Eastern Europe in the fall you should see it in the spring, it's beautiful.
Oh, you.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, you've got a good sense of humor.
Obviously, you got that from your dad.
Oh, you know my Dad?
Well, yes, didn't I just mention that a moment ago?
Ah!
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
Of course.
Big man on campus.
Right.
Right.
Ah.
I see here that you've worked for a lot of charities.
Which one meant the most to you?
Um The second one.
But this has all been about me, Mr. Bradley.
Me, me, me.
Frank, is there a Mrs. Bradley?
A couple of baby Bradleys?
Hey, have you seen Braveheart?
Look, friend, we can talk about candy all day but you ain't gonna convince me that blue was a bad way to go.
By the way I hear that whistle blowing.
I got a train to catch.
- Well, let's go.
- Hey, hold on there, Sparky.
Before you catch any train, how about you telling me what you're running away from?
Okay.
But this won't be pretty.
I must say, I was riveted by your thesis on regressive taxation.
How did you arrive at such a scintillating hypothesis?
But I guess the signs were always there.
Oh, sure these chiseled good looks and striking personality opened the doors of opportunity quickly but lately, they've been closing even quicker.
Oh, heck, who am I kidding?
Look at me, I'm not Princeton material.
Like the song says, Pappy "you gotta know when to fold them".
It's my time to fold.
Sounds like, to me, you're giving up.
You're a smart man, Pappy.
Listen, Carlton, it's one thing to throw in the hand but it's another thing to get up from the table and quit the game.
You honestly believe that Superman could beat the Flash in a foot race?
Oh, Mr. Bradley, I'm glad you're still here.
Carlton Banks.
What?
That's poppycock.
I'm Carlton Banks.
No, Will, your charade is not necessary.
Now, if you'll excuse us, Mr. Bradley and I need to talk.
A lot of these legacies I interview, they've got the grades, the résumé but they're sheltered, you know?
Like that milquetoast cousin of yours.
But you really impressed me tonight.
I'd be happy to sign a letter of recommendation for you.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Thanks for covering for me tonight.
Oh, no, no problem, man.
I'm just glad you came back when you did.
I'm starting to get a little too comfortable in this stuff, know what I'm saying?
Um Carlton, hold up.
Mom and Dad leave for the night and you take advantage like this?
And what about you, mister?
What kind of role model are you?
If it weren't for me, the two of you would have this family on the way to hell in a handbasket.
And another thing, what?
- He's back.
- He's back.
What do you mean, I'm back?
Of course, I'm back.
I'm home.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Will, I'm ready.
You said you'd teach me one of your basketball tricks.
Oh, well, you know, my moves are kind of like top secret, Nick.
I mean, I could show you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Okay.
Well, maybe I'll make an exception this one time, all right?
All right.
Come on.
D me up, D me up.
All right, check it out.
Now, this is called the Will Smith Hoop Dream, Dunk on Hakeem Down the Lane, House of Pain pass.
I see you wasn't ready for that one.
Back in Philly, they used to call me Will "The 747" Smith.
- Wanna know why?
- Why?
Because I'm about to jet.
This weekend?
Oh, I'd love to, Thad, but I'm gonna lay low.
Oh, no, it's nothing serious, just the flu.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Okay, bye.
Thad?
I thought you were dating Kyle.
I am.
He's the flu.
- Go, girl.
- You see what I'm saying?
It sounds like it's raining men.
I hope y'all are taking notes.
Hey, hey, hey, stop being all freaky.
Hi, Will.
What you doing?
Five to ten if you don't take your hands off me.
Hill, what you think?
You did a pretty good show today, huh?
Three words: Stink.
Stank.
Stunk.
It was the worst show we have ever done.
We need better guests.
Wait, wait.
Don't be getting all mad at me.
I'm just the assistant talent coordinator.
If I had some more responsibility, maybe we'd have some better guests.
Then get me someone great for tomorrow's show.
And if it were my responsibility, then I'd do it.
Okay, I'm telling you to do it.
All right, and if I thought you meant it, then I'd get it done.
That's right, my baby can definitely get it done.
Don't make me turn the hose on you, all right?
Will, I need more stimulating guests.
I need someone who can hold my attention for more than three seconds.
- All right.
How about we get?
I gotta go.
Hey.
Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?
Would you like to buy a vowel?
You know, this trial is gonna be the death of me.
We lost another juror today.
Oh, really?
Hey, did you check under your robe?
I can see you're not in the mood for that right now.
Here.
Come on.
Right here.
Right here.
So come on, man.
What happened?
He was writing a book.
The bailiff found him hiding in the men's room with his laptop.
You sure he wasn't just downloading his floppy?
- Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
- Ha-ha-ha!
Shut up.
Can you hear me?
Hi, I'm Carlton Banks, and I joined Great Introductions to give you red-hot mamas a chance to take a walk on the wild side.
So climb on board.
Hm.
A tad forward.
I am tan, I am a tourist and I'd love to give a lucky mademoiselle like you a chance to meet moi.
That felt close.
Do you guys mind?
What is your problem, Pepe Le Puny?
Hardy har har.
And in a related story Judge Philip Banks has dismissed yet another juror in the Show-Biz Madam Case.
As cameras are not allowed in his courtroom we have an artist's rendering of his action.
Specific details are not yet available as to why the juror was dismissed.
Wait, I know that guy.
Of course you do.
That's my Dad, you half-life.
- Not him, the other dude.
- Oh, what, you knew him?
He's my barber.
The dude that cut that jack-o'-lantern in your head last Halloween?
That's the guy.
It'd have been great if that candle hadn't burned the roof of my mouth.
Jazz, do you think he'd do Hilary?
Why not?
She got a nice big head.
This place is so tiny.
I can't even imagine how small the facial room must be.
Hill, why don't you come on over here and sit down?
Here you go.
Read this Jet magazine and let me handle my business, all right?
- Okay, you're next.
- Hey.
Whoa, hey.
Now, you know I'm gonna have to charge you extra for working around these ears.
Well, no, hold up, my man.
Actually, I'm not here to get a haircut.
Well, you in the wrong place, fool.
Well, no, a friend of mine sent me.
You know Jazz?
The idiot that put the candle in his mouth?
- That's him.
- All right, now, what can I do you for?
- Well, see, actually, my cousin and l - Will, let me handle this.
Hi.
As you probably already know, I'm Hilary Banks.
Who?
Ha, ha!
That's very funny.
I would be really honored if you would be a guest on my show.
What is it with you people?
First, you got Geraldo coming in here you know his head is as empty as Al Capone's vault, then you had Montel.
I told Montel, "Yeah, I'll do your show when you grow some hair".
Now, listen, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them.
I'm not interested in doing tabloid television.
I have my dignity and I have my self-respect.
- We got cash.
- You got George.
Oh!
Carlton, can I use your car on Saturday?
No can do, Ashley.
I have a date.
You're kidding.
With who?
Well, I haven't worked that part out yet.
But once this dating-service thing kicks in this hombre's dance card is gonna be pretty full.
Oh, yeah, just yuk it up.
He who laughs last See, it's started already.
- Master Carlton - Not now, Geoffrey.
"You're in my thoughts.
Love, Thad".
Thad?
That's a pretty sexy-sounding name.
I'm thinking long legs.
No, these are for me from Thad.
Now what am I supposed to do?
Please, for carnations and a little baby's breath?
Nothing.
Hey.
Hey, Carlton, you will never guess who we got on the show for tomorrow.
So there's no sense of me playing, is there?
Hey, Uncle Phil, about that juror you just - I'm sorry, Will, but I can't talk about it.
- Daddy, the juror How many times do I have to tell you kids that I just can't talk about it?
Ugh!
Hey, Nicky, you will never guess who we got How many times do I have to tell you kids?
I just can't talk about it.
Ugh!
Excuse me, I'm here to return this radio.
Back of the line.
Hey, aren't you Judge Banks?
Well, yes, I am.
Hey, everybody, it's Judge Banks from the television.
Hey.
You think that show-biz madam did it or what, huh?
I'm sorry, but I can't discuss the case.
Then I can't discuss your radio.
Back of the line.
All right, why don't you just relax, cool out a little bit?
Hilary will be out soon.
How you feeling?
You a little nervous?
Why should I be nervous?
I'm all liquored up.
You are hilarious, man.
Hey, have a seat.
Have a seat.
Listen, I just wanna let you that, you know any point during the show you feel like you might wanna I don't know, toss my name in, "Will Smith," you know, it's cool.
Okay.
Ready, George?
Of course, I'm ready.
I've been waiting around for an hour.
Where's my money?
Hey, look.
All right.
I'm gonna be right over here.
Remember, Will Smith.
Will Smith.
All right, everybody, have a great show.
Okay.
Now, just relax, be yourself, and remember to keep your answers short.
The audience didn't come to hear the guest babble on and on.
In five, four, three, two  Hello and welcome to Hilary.
We're very excited today to have as our guest recently dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Trial, George Howlings.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Well, I guess what we're all dying to know is why you were dismissed.
You know, they told the press I was writing a book, but that's not it.
Oh?
Tell us what it really was.
Well, they said I was crazy, but I'm not crazy.
But you wanna know who is crazy?
Maybe I shouldn't say this on TV.
Oh, come on, George.
Just between you and me who was crazy?
That lard-butt of a judge.
That man is crazy as they come.
GEORGE : What does it take to become a judge these days?
Now, if you ask me, that man was very incompetent.
Couldn't judge a beauty pageant.
About as useless as a no-mouthed dog at a Frisbee contest.
If I ever see him, I'll lower him like a cheap carpet.
And it looked to me, he dozed off every now and then.
George Probably dreaming about that bony-legged prosecutor.
I think they got something going on.
Ain't that right, Will Smith?
Hill.
Hill.
Hold up.
He's gonna kill us.
Will, it's not like it was our fault.
We can't control what someone says.
Daddy will understand that.
Well, I hope so.
And if not, I'll just blame the whole thing on you.
Oops.
Did I say that out loud?
Is he in there?
No, the coast is Clear!
Hi, Daddy.
You look so handsome.
Oh, not bad for a lard butt, huh?
I guess there's no reason to ask whether or not you saw the show today.
Oh, I saw the show.
We all saw the show.
Wait, wait, hold up, Uncle Phil.
Now, before you get started I wanna let you know that finger pointing isn't gonna get us nowhere.
And also that it's not called The Will Show.
Oh, please.
You're the one that introduced me to that nut.
Daddy, punish him.
He needs tough love.
That is enough.
I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life.
And to think the two people responsible for it are my own family.
My own flesh and blood.
Um Technically, Uncle Phil, I'm not really your flesh and blood.
See, my Mom and Aunt Viv, they I see where you going with this though.
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah, I can see.
Pssh-pssh!
Then tell me, what is it?
Haven't I done enough for you?
Taking you into my home, huh?
Treated you with respect.
Maybe I did something to hurt you, is that it?
No.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
No.
No, that's not it.
- Then why?
- I don't I don't know.
And you my own daughter.
My first-born.
I don't know if there's a knife that could cut as deeply.
We tried to tell you yesterday.
That's your excuse?
You didn't have the sense to know that that man would be angry with me for dismissing him?
You didn't have the common sense to know that?
I don't have any common sense.
You two have profoundly hurt and disappointed me.
Unc Uncle Uncle Ph Unc You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Aunt Aunt Aunt - A Ashley.
- You understand, don't you?
Nicky.
Come on Ow!
Man.
- Hill, you know what you gonna say?
- I'm just gonna speak from the heart.
Hey, now just remember, this is from both of us.
Don't be out there taking all the credit.
Have a good show.
Here we go.
In five seconds, four, three, two Hello and welcome to Hilary.
Today's show is a very special tribute to fathers.
But before we get to our guests I'd like to say something special about a very important man in my life.
My father, Judge Philip Banks.
Yesterday, a dismissed juror in the Show-Biz Madam Trial came on the show and said some really icky things about him.
My cousin Will and I were, well, to say the least, shocked.
- And now Daddy won't even talk to us.
He won't say nothing.
HILARY : And we feel like strangers in our own house.
Please, Daddy, forgive us.
Please.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Ow!
And we don't know what we supposed to do.
I'm sorry, no one answered the front door.
I have a package for a Carlton Banks.
That's me.
Oh, no, not another rejection.
Bad news?
I sent this to Last Chance Video Dating.
You know, "We guarantee you a date," except if your name is Carlton Banks.
Trust me.
It doesn't work if your name is Michelle Williams either.
- You tried this?
- I tried them all.
Wow.
I wouldn't expect someone like you to have trouble meeting people.
The only people I meet are dogs and shut-ins.
Why can't it be easier?
I mean, why can't you just open the door and meet someone nice?
Well, bye.
Wait a minute.
Would you?
Uh Uh Like to go out Saturday night?
Yeah.
- Hey, I'm not - Coming on too strong?
Not at all.
Bye.
Sweet mother of God, that's a firm handshake.
Trust me, if Daddy saw the show this afternoon, everything will be fine.
And if he didn't, we'll show it to him.
Now, do you know how to work one of these things?
What are you two doing?
Hey, man.
Did you see anything, I don't know, good on TV today?
No.
- So you didn't see the show?
- Oh, I saw the show.
And now thanks to you, not only am I an incompetent judge, but an unfit parent.
Tell me, what do you have planned for tomorrow?
Perhaps snapshots of me in the bathtub, huh?
Or a video of me chasing stray dogs in my car.
Daddy, you don't do that, do you?
You two are the most irresponsible All right, I've heard enough.
Now, I did see something good on TV today.
I saw two people begging for forgiveness and feeling very badly for hurting someone that they love.
Oh, please, Vivian.
Don't buy into the propaganda.
That's enough.
Now, what I wanna hear now is an apology and the acceptance of the apology.
Go ahead.
- We sorry.
- We're sorry.
- We sorry, man.
We sorry.
Man, we sorry.
- We're really, really, really sorry, Daddy.
Okay, now you.
I accept your apology.
Philip.
I accept your apology.
Okay.
- Now hug.
Come on.
- Ohh.
Hold up.
Hold up.
This is the way it's supposed to be.
One big happy family.
Uncle Phil, man, I just wanna say again how sorry Enough, enough said, Will.
Enough.
Let's just put it all behind us.
What's done is done.
I just wanna sit here and watch a little TV.
LENO : Anybody see the Hilary show the other day?
They had a dismissed juror from the Show-Biz Madam Case insulting Judge Banks, who just happens to be Hilary's father.
Boy, here's a family that really puts the "fun" back in dysfunctional, isn't it?
Speaking of Judge Banks, we have a special tribute to him tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome The Dancing Phils.
- That's it!
I've had enough!
- But, wait - Daddy - No, no.
Just go.
Just go.
Please.
- Ohh!
Go!
Wait, wait a minute.
Now, you wait one minute, Uncle Phil.
Now, I didn't wanna have to do this but you brought this on yourself.
And I am telling you I'm not going Even though the rough times are showing There's just no way, there's no way Tear down the mountains Yell, scream and shout You can say what you want I'm not walking out Stop all the rivers, push, strike and kill I'm not gonna leave you There's no way I will And I am telling you I'm not going You're the best man I'll ever know There's no way I can ever, ever go No, no, no, no way No, no, no, no way I'm living without you Oh, I'm not living without you Not living without you I don't wanna be free I'm staying I'm staying And you, and you, and you You're gonna You're gonna love me
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
What you doing, Carlton?
Oh, packing away my CDs.
Will and I made a bet.
For one week, I'm not allowed to listen to Tom Jones and he's not allowed to listen to that god-awful Biggie Smalls.
We have $50 riding on it and I'm gonna win.
Who's Tom Jones?
Nicky, Nicky.
Tom Jones is the King of Swing.
The Tower of Power.
Mr. Vegas.
This guy's a legend.
Can I hear one of his songs?
Oh, I'd love to, but no can do.
Please?
Well, I guess one song wouldn't hurt.
Just couldn't hang on there could you, little fella?
Darn.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Here's something for your trouble, little brother.
Thanks a lot.
Five bucks?
What do I look like?
Come on, man.
You got to break me off some.
- That movie was pathetic.
- Pathetic.
Naked women bumping and grinding on strangers' laps?
And the way them guys just sat there and took it.
How can anyone find that attractive?
I mean, is our culture that diseased?
You know, just thinking about it is making me feel dirty.
You know, I'm gonna have to take a shower.
You wanna join me?
What am I saying?
It's even infected me.
Hola.
- Hi.
- What'd you guys end up seeing?
- Showgirls.
- Again?
What does that make it, eight times, Will?
Eight times?
You told me you hated it.
No, baby, I did.
I mean And every time, I wanted to just walk out of there.
I know the feeling, Will.
Bye.
Wait, but, baby.
Baby, hol Oh, girl.
Boy, did you handle that badly.
Oh, good, Geoffrey, you're here.
No.
When did I ever ask you for anything?
You never stopped asking from the moment I started here.
- That's not true.
- In fact, as I remember I spent my first seven hours of service here installing wall-to-wall carpet for Barbie's Dream House.
Carpet which had to be promptly removed.
Well, it's not my fault that when Ken got home, he didn't like it.
And it wasn't my fault the dollhouse burnt to the ground.
Geoffrey, Skipper died in that fire.
I don't even wanna think about it.
Look, I need you to hem this dress.
Come on.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.
Have you seen the notes I've been working on for my speech tomorrow?
They're right here, big guy.
I've crossed out what didn't work and rewritten the rest.
How thoughtful.
- Daddy, can I use your car tonight?
- No.
- How about Mom's?
- Talk to her.
Mom, Dad said it's okay for me to use your car tonight.
I didn't say that.
Those weren't your exact words, Uncle Phil, but you kind of did imply that You know, there was absolutely no reason for me to jump in here, was there?
None whatsoever.
- I'm gonna go ahead and jump out of here.
- Yes, jump on with your bad self.
- It's fine if you take the car, honey.
- Oh, thank you.
Ashley's going out tonight.
I've given Geoffrey the night off and Nicky's going to his first sleepover.
Mm-hm.
- Philip, the house will be nice and quiet.
- Mm.
- You know what that means?
- Yeah, I can finally finish my speech.
- Philip.
- What?
- What?
- Nobody said anything.
Nicky's first sleepover.
Ahh.
I'll never forget my first overnighter.
Ned Martin's house.
Raised all kinds of heck.
Drank hot chocolate.
Had pillow fights.
Watched the O.J. trial.
What a night.
- Hi, Carlton.
- Hi, Michelle.
Here, I have a special delivery letter for you.
Odd.
No return address.
A special invitation from me to you for tonight.
Please R.S.V.P.
ASAP.
Darn, another chain letter.
Carlton, it's from me.
Sweet cheeks of Buddha, you pack a wallop.
So you wanna go out tonight?
Oh.
No can do.
I have to study tonight.
On Saturday night?
For some, it's bath night.
For me, it's math night.
- But, hey, maybe you could help me?
- Oh.
Well, I'd probably just get in your way.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Well, bye.
Bye.
Hmm.
She seems a bit of a gloomy Gus.
I can't believe Michelle hasn't called.
I've left messages.
I've paged her.
Oh, God, I hope she's not disgruntled.
You better be worrying about me being disgruntled after the way you messed my date up today.
Will, I've come to the realization I don't understand women.
Or men, for that matter.
Maybe I should just talk to my Dad.
He understands women.
I'm sorry about before.
We're gonna have a great time tonight, sweetheart.
A great time.
You know what I'm saying?
I love you.
Mm.
Do you?
Sweetheart, I just said I did.
And you look beautiful.
- Philip.
- I'm serious.
For someone who's had four children, you look amazing.
Sandra, I'm telling you.
I really hated that movie.
I don't know.
I guess in some sick kind of way I was just trying to punish myself.
No, no, no.
You're right.
No, I can be serious.
Ju Let me prove it to you.
Sandra, I seriously wanna go out with you tonight.
Your cousin?
No, no.
I mean, I can find somebody to go out with your cousin, yeah.
Oh, no, no.
That's no problem at all.
Hey, and I got the perfect guy for the job.
All right, baby, you're the breast Best!
Best!
I said best!
No.
Hey, hey, Carlton.
Come on, man.
You owe me.
You almost wrecked everything with Sandra.
I'm not gonna do it.
Oh, you're not gonna do it.
You know what?
That's fine.
It's probably time for me to move on anyway, you know.
As luck would have it, it's come to my attention that there's this cute little mail carrier that's available.
- You wouldn't.
- Yeah, you're right.
But that would be exactly what you deserved.
Will, I'm sorry and I know I owe you one.
But I just wouldn't feel right going out and having a good time without Michelle.
What if I could promise you a terrible time?
If I could only be sure.
I guarantee you the worst time that you have ever had in your life.
Okay.
We finally have the house all to ourselves.
Hi.
Don't stop.
Go on with whatever you're doing.
Wait.
Oh, my God.
Ew.
What were you doing?
I don't even wanna think about it.
- Where's Geoffrey?
- He's got the night off.
What about my dress?
I'm pretty sure he was wearing pants.
Eww.
Oh, let me tell you now, that there was some good grub.
That girl can cook.
What about you, Carlton?
Did you enjoy your dinner?
It was fine.
You don't talk much, do you?
Uhh, as a child, he was dropped on his tongue.
I think he's the strong silent type.
Ooh.
You are strong.
Well, I'm no stranger to the gym.
Carlton, how about some dessert?
I've got ice cream.
Sweet chocolate ice cream.
I'm a tutti-frutti man myself.
What the heck is wrong with you, Carlton?
That girl just offered you two scoops.
I'm afraid I'm a one-gal guy.
What's so funny?
We were just thinking of a little game we could play.
- Tiffany.
- Oh, come on, Sandra.
It'll be fun.
- Wait.
What'll be fun?
- A word game.
Oh, that ain't exactly the kind of a game I was thinking about.
It involves the word "strip".
Set it up.
Tell me this, Doogie.
How is it possible that we're losing?
I can't pull a vowel to save my life.
As soon as you get warm, I wanna see some skin again.
You're on the demanding side, ain't you, girl?
- Hey, just play them or lose them.
- Hey.
Hey.
This thing is not over yet.
Ah!

That is if your breath don't kill us first.
Damn, man.
Don't you bring a mint when you go on a date?
As a matter of fact, I do.
They're in my pants pocket.
You wanna go get them for me?
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Mad Dog.
I'm sure he's nothing but a pussy cat.
He's gonna eat me.
And then he gonna floss with me.
I'm tired of your excuses.
MAD  But it's not an excuse.
Just give me a minute to explain and then I'm out of here.

You're right.
Thank you for a very lovely evening.

- It's under him.
Why you put our clothes?
Bel-Air's not that long of a walk.

We all right.
We all right.
Go ahead.

Under.
Go on without me.
Save yourself.
Forget the clothes.
Let's just get out of here.

All right, but the best defense is a strong offense, okay?
So remember me for this.
I'll see you on the other side.
Sorry.
Oh, my God.
I just saw the state of Florida just pass over my head.
Hey, hey.
Hey, Mad Dog.
Mad Dog.
Bro, bro, you know Come on, man.
Shouldn't you be climbing up the Empire State Building?
- Will, the window.
- Go, go.
Bet you wish you wouldn't have gone off that Slim Fast now, don't you?
You're lucky.
But eventually, you're gonna have to come back in here.
Shut up and get back in there, you're stretching the building.
Will, what are we gonna do now?
Oh.
Well, you know, it's almost winter.
Eventually, he's gonna have to hibernate.
All we got to do, just hang out up here, don't bring no attention to ourselves.
Hey, look, those guys are gonna jump.
No, no, man.
We're just out getting some air, man.
This is the worst night of my life.
Ain't that what I promised you?
Don't panic.
I'm from the Crisis Intervention Unit.
You're young.
You're young.
"And you have everything to live for".
Just get us down.
There you go, putting the cart before the horse.
Now, hand me the baby.
Man, what are you doing?
We ain't got no baby, man.
Oh, my bad.
Will you get the hell out of our way, fool?
Hey, there's no need to be calling names.
Sticks and stones will break your bones but a 50-foot fall will kill y'all.
I made that up myself.
That civil service exam is really easy, isn't it?
But I have to admit there are times that I just don't understand women.
And it doesn't get any easier when you get older.
This is the one right here.
Check this out.
"I shouldn't have to tell you.
I mean, you should just know".
How am I supposed to know?
Who do I look like, Dionne Warwick?
No, no, no.
This is my favorite.
"If you love me as much as you say you do, you'd know what I'm feeling".
How am I supposed to know what you're feeling?
What does that mean?
What are you guys talking about that's so funny?
Sports.
- Football.
- Sports.
Funny.
I'm off to the hairdresser to talk sports myself.
Hey, this is the one right here.
This is the one.
"If you was listening to me, what'd I just say"?
- They always say that.
- I wasn't listening, you know?
Yo, yo, yo, how about this one?
"Slow down, you're moving too fast.
We hardly even know each other".
And then she has the nerve to get upset.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Aw   Stop.
Why?
Derek, stop.
Okay.
Why'd you stop?
I lost my head.
You know, Ash, it's been great being back in town visiting all the colleges but the best part has been being with you.
Oh.
I miss you.
Me too.
Sixteen years on the same street and you had to blow it by moving.
If I don't get into Stanford, I'll go to ULA.
And then I'll be around all the time.
Derek, you'll get in.
You're too smart.
I wish you were dumber.
I'd have a boyfriend again.
Hey, you never stopped having one.
- You're saying that because you like me.
- No.
I'm saying that because I love you.
Aw!
Look at you two.
Almost a year apart and you two lovebirds haven't missed a beat.
Will, look - Not another word.
I'm not gonna disturb you.
I'm gonna just go in the kitchen and get me a little beverage or something.
Although, these are the moments of your life.
- Will.
- Oh, no, no, you're right.
You guys are grown adults and I don't have no business disrespecting you like this.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna just go away.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I got something for you.
- Oh, Derek, what is it?
- Just open it.
Oh, a little horse.
Yep.
That's from when we rode the carousel down at the pier.
- That's when we first held hands.
- Uh-uh-uh.
Oh, ha, ha, my God, a little Rollerblade.
Eh?
Remember when we went roller skating down in Venice?
That's when we first kissed.
Derek, this is so sweet.
I can't believe you did this.
You know, we've had a lot of firsts together.
I know.
You know, Ashley, there's a There's another first I think we should do together.
Really?
What?
Well, I love you, Ashley, and I think we should make love.
Together?
Good morning, Geoffrey.
Playing dress-up again, Master Carlton?
For your information, I'm installing the new intercom system.
You?
Yuck it up, Brit boy, but remember, he who laughs last  Laughs best.
You know, I kind of remember him being taller.
Really?
I don't.
Excuse me, Carlton.
I'm gonna let that one slide, young man.
Obviously, you've fallen in with a bad element.
Derek, I'm telling you, you'd love ULA.
You gotta come down and check it out.
- Me and my man, we call it the Hive.
- Hmm?
Because the honeys be swarming.
- Can you hear me?
- Oh.
Can you hear me?
Oh, hi, Derek.
Oh, hi, Ashley.
That's disgusting.
No.
Actually, Carlton, that's a kiss.
If you're lucky, one day you'll experience one.
Very funny.
By the way, Will, I just got a call from Oz the Wizard said your brain is ready.
So, Ash, we're still on for tonight, right?
Yeah.
What are you, tripping, man?
She can't say no to you.
- Will.
- What?
That's great.
I gotta go do a couple errands.
I'm out of here.
Okay.
Bye.
I'm watching you, mister.
Really?
Let me help you.
I never liked the cut of that boy's jib.
I'm not sure you should be admitting you've been looking at that boy's jib.
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, baby.
- Um, has Mom called yet?
- Yeah, you just missed her.
- Is there something I can help you with?
- No.
No.
I just wanted to see how her conference was going.
I had a question about, uh Um Makeup, heh.
Makeup?
Keep away from that blue eye shadow.
Great.
Thanks, Dad.
Hilary, can I talk to you for a minute?
Not now, Ash, my show starts in five minutes.
Uh-oh.
Big-sister radar.
It's important, isn't it?
I can tell.
I have, like, a third sense about these things.
Hilary, do you remember the first time you fell in love?
Oh, this is important.
Ha, ha.
Come.
Come.
Come.
Sit.
Sit.
Sit.
It was Lawrence Young, the most beautiful man at Bel-Air Prep.
Oh!
To put it simply, he was a god.
He had been held back three years so he was really buff.
- Oh, he had the most amazing - Hilary.
Hilary.
Hilary, I get the picture.
Oh, Ashley, are you in love?
I think so.
I feel like Derek's the one.
I don't think I'll ever feel this way about anybody else.
Oh, Ash, I am so happy for you.
But long-distance relationships don't usually work out.
I mean, look at the Little Mermaid.
I mean, she was stuck in the sea and he was stuck on land.
But they ended up together.
Yeah, with the help of a lobster.
You know a lobster?
Look, Hilary, Derek and I have been spending a lot of time together and we really care about each other.
And last night, the subject came up about, um uh, sex.
Oh.
- Oh, did you?
- No, no.
No, heh.
But I've been thinking about it and I just wanna know how you know if I can just tell you that for me, Lawrence and I really loved each other and we both felt that we were able to make a responsible decision.
We decided that the time was right.
Any regrets?
Didn't I tell you he was buff?
Hello.
But, I mean, Hilary, weren't you scared?
Of course, everyone is.
But I was ready.
And only you know if you're ready or not.
Ashley, for as long as I can remember, you have been independent responsible and smart.
Now, I know you're aware of all the issues and whatever decision you do make, I'm always here for you.
Thank you, Hilary.
Oh.
Hoo!
Now I know how Mom felt when we had this talk.
- What did Daddy say when you told him?
- Are you kidding?
He still thinks I'm a virgin.
Okay, what do you think?
Nope.
Well, if you guys don't pick one, I'll be going on this date wearing a headband.
I'm sure Derek wouldn't mind.
Keesha, he's not like that.
He says we're soul mates.
I don't know what I'm gonna do when he leaves.
I miss him already.
Somebody is in love.
So, um, are you guys, you know?
No.
Have you guys ever?
Nope.
But it sounds like you're getting close.
Well, all I know is when Derek and I make love, it'll be special.
- When?
- lf.
Will, the new intercom system is working like gangbusters.
Now we can talk to one another from different rooms.
I don't wanna talk to you when we're in the same room.
Check out the exciting new roam feature.
Let's listen to my room.
Well, all's quiet in there.
Oh, there's a surprise.
Subject: Geoffrey's room.
GEOFFREY : I wonder how I'd look if I shaved my entire body.
Changing channels.
KEESHA : If you and Derek have sex you'll be the first one in our group to lose her virginity.
Derek is leaving tomorrow.
So are you gonna do it?
Keesha, it's not "doing it".
It's making love.
And, yes, I think we're gonna do it tonight.
Oh, my God.
What are we gonna do?
This is what we're gonna do, we're gonna stop listening.
You're right.
Enough listening, time for action.
She needs de-programming.
We'll make her watch movies.
Lots of movies.
Doris Day movies.
Now, there's a good wholesome role model.
Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be Wait a minute.
"Whatever will be, will be"?
What kind of devil-may-care message is that?
- The slut.
- Okay, Carlton.
Carlton.
Look, you need to calm down, all right?
Look, we need to find a Yellow Pages.
I'm calling a nunnery.
It's late, so I'll need a 24-hour one.
Carlton, man, we ain't even Catholic.
Oh!
Would you have an open mind?
Carlton, are you listening to yourself?
I don't have time for that.
I know, we'll do the good-cop, bad-cop thing.
I'm her brother so it's appropriate I play the bad cop.
- No, Carlton - Okay, big baby.
You can be the bad cop.
- Let's move.
- Carlton.
Carlton.
What is?
What is wrong with you?
Would you unhand me?
You gonna go upstairs and make a fool out of yourself?
If need be.
Someone has to stop the insanity.
This is all your fault.
"Ashley could never say no to you".
I told you I didn't like the cut of his jib.
Now, are you gonna be the bad cop or not?
- Look, Carlton - Oh!
Come here.
Now listen, ain't nobody gonna be no cop and ain't nobody going upstairs because we wasn't suppose to hear what she said.
Need I remind you there are demons out there that go by the name of: Sexually transmitted diseases, risk of pregnancy improper use of a condom?
- You'd have us do nothing?
- I didn't say we ain't gonna do nothing.
- Well, then what do you propose we do?
- You'll know as soon as I can figure out  - How y'all doing?
Hi.
- Is Derek here yet?
- Oh.
- He ain't coming.
- What?
Yeah, it was a big accident, you know, out on the 605.
Yeah, a jackknifed big rig, you know, spilled out a big load of, uh Jackknives.
- Hey, everybody, what's up?
- Hey!
What's happening?
Thank God you're alive.
- We're gonna take off.
- Okay.
- Have fun.
- See you, guys.
Bye.
I'm gonna go get a sweater.
I'll be right back.
Yeah, Ashley, that's a good idea.
Go get a sweater.
You know, to - So, what's up, man?
- What's up, man?
You think me and Carlton can have a word with you for a second here?
- What's going on?
- We're asking the questions here, pally.
- So, Derek, you know about football?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you do?
Or, yeah, you don't?
Are you familiar with the term "offsides"?
Oh, yeah.
That's when somebody crosses the line too soon.
Exactly.
So I can see you know what I'm talking about here then.
No.
No, you do?
Or, no, you don't?
Carlton.
Let's put it this way.
You're rounding third base and you're headed for home.
You're excited because you think you're about to score easy.
Here's the problem.
You're in a visitor's ballpark and if you do score the angry fans might not be able to be held responsible for their actions.
And it's bat night.
All right, are you two in trouble with a bookie or something?
- Let's stop beating around the bush.
- Hey, man.
You're playing chess, your rook has been blindsided by the queen's gambit.
You can play honorably, leave your bishop at home but protect your queen's virtue or you can take the sleazy road and castle your king and go right for the mate.
And it's bat night.
Do I make myself clear?
Ready to go, Derek?
What's up?
We were just saying hi.
- Definitely.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Oh, Carlton?
Why don't you, uh, take Derek outside see if his lights and his horns is working on the car?
I'm gonna talk to Ashley.
My lights?
Wha?
Will, that's enough.
Now, what's going on?
What's going on?
That's a very intelligent question, Ashley.
"What's Going On".
That's a Marvin Gaye song too.
Good night, Will.
Ashley, no!
Ashley, don't do it.
Do what?
Me and Carlton were roaming on this stupid intercom and we roamed right into your conversation and we heard what you said about you and Derek.
You were spying on me?
Ashley, now spying, that's such an ugly word.
We were roaming.
I can't believe you guys invaded my privacy.
Oh, but, Ashley First of all, how dare you listen to my conversation?
Second of all, it is none of your business.
- None of my business?
- Right.
This is my life.
I decide what I do or don't do.
You know, I would expect this from Carlton but not you.
Uh You haven't said a word all the way up here.
Did I do something?
Oh, no, no.
So, what's going on?
Carlton and Will listened to me and my friends having a really private conversation.
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.
They heard me saying some things that I just didn't want them to hear.
- Like what?
- Just some stuff.
Well, what kind of stuff?
Stuff about, um, me and you.
Oh, good stuff?
Yeah.
They heard me telling my friends that, um That I wanted you to be my first.
Did you mean that?
You think you're ready?
Well, if you are.
- Are you?
- Sure.
Uh I guess.
Ashley, it sounds to me like you're not too sure.
Well, does it bother you that you're leaving tomorrow?
Well, yeah.
Does it bother you?
I think it does.
Would you rather not do this?
I just never thought my first time would be with someone who was leaving me.
- What if we never see each other again?
- Ash, we'll see each other again.
Then we really don't have to rush.
I'm sorry.
Baby, you don't have to apologize to me.
So, heh, what do you wanna do now?
I don't know.
Miniature golf?
Let's do it.
Golf.
- Ashley.
- Back off, Will.
You telling me to back off, girl?
Hold up.
Now, this is me.
We always used to be able to talk about anything.
Talk.
Well, you know, I just wanna say that I'm sorry that we invaded your privacy.
- I can't believe you did that.
- I know.
I said it was wrong.
It's just hard for me to accept the fact that you're doing the You know, that you're gonna be  you know.
I mean, I know you're cute, it's just that - Will, let's just forget about it.
- Well, no.
No.
I can't forget about it.
In my eyes, you still the little girl that used to follow me around all the time.
Now you wearing dresses and got makeup and the whole nine.
It's just It makes me uncomfortable to know that you're having  a sex life.
Fine.
Be uncomfortable.
Look, Will I didn't do anything.
I mean I love Derek.
And I thought I was ready but I'm not.
You know, for a minute, just for a minute I forgot how smart you are.
I guess I kind of panicked a little bit.
Yeah.
You remember the first time I asked you about sex?
You panicked then too.
I did not.
Yes, you did.
You said that you needed to have a license to have sex and that I couldn't even take the test until I was 35.
That's true.
Well I guess it's not the worst thing in the world to have a cousin who cares too much.
All right, come here.
CARLTON : That was so beautiful.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
So this is what you wanna do, huh?
You think you want some of me, huh?
Let's go.
Blackjack.
Man, that's three in a row.
I should be taking you to Vegas with me instead of Carlton.
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Pay the man.
You know what that is?
Irritating.
It's energy generated by the most awesome source of natural power in the world.
What, the static from Uncle Phil's corduroys?
The Hoover Dam.
Here, I got you this book so when we get to Vegas, you'll be Hoover savvy.
I'm getting goose bumps.
You too?
Okay, guys.
Here you go.
Here are your airplane tickets and your hotel confirmation.
Thanks.
This is gonna be the greatest birthday present ever.
It's a shame you have to go to Sacramento.
Oh, I know.
I know.
But, son, this isn't just a birthday, this is your 21st birthday.
And this isn't just a trip, it's a rite of passage.
Cheyenne Indians used to take a young brave and leave him in the desert and he'd have to fend for himself with nothing but a knife.
But when he left that desert, he was a man.
There's certainly some places in this desert where a brother can become a man.
I don't know where none of them at, you know, you know, but I'm gonna go ahead and get my knife.
Aww.
Okay, ladies, I'm leaving.
They don't hear you, sir.
They've begun their women's weekend.
Right now, they're in phase one.
Chick flicks and mint Milanos.
I said, I'm leaving.
Well, it's not like you're going off to war, sir.
I just know that one day Thelma and Louise will make it to the other side of the canyon.
Somebody pinch me.
I'm in the same city with Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, and Engelbert Humperdinck.
So many shows, so little time.
Ugh.
I can't believe I'm in the same city as Girls, Girls, Girls.
Oh!
So many shows, so little time.
Whoo-hoo!
Bells ringing, money flowing.
We are certainly not in Kansas anymore.
Oh, Auntie Em, Dorothy got a miniskirt on.
We've entered the world of temptation.
A word to the wise, beware.
All right, here's the plan.
First, we split up - And?
- That's it.
We just split up.
All right, I get it.
We'll gamble for about an hour or so, but then we have to hit the hay.
We don't wanna miss sunrise at Hoover Dam.
They say it starts out mauve.
You're an odd little man, aren't you?
Yeah.
Change for a dollar, please.
There's a $5 minimum, sir.
Outrageous.
We're out of here, Will.
Whoa, wait a minute, Carlton.
Relax, man.
Can I get change for 100, please?
A hundred?
Are you insane?
Change 100.
See, she can't believe it either.
Okay.
"You're at a friend's house for Christmas dinner and you find a dead cockroach in your salad.
What do you do"?
I eat around it, because cockroaches go straight to my thighs.
- I'd switch plates with Carlton.
Ha-ha.
Okay, Hilary, it's your turn.
I'll ask you a question.
"Would it bother you much if upon your death your body was simply thrown into the woods and abandoned"?
Does it say what I'm wearing?
Geoffrey, you scared us.
Ahem.
I'm sorry, madam.
It's just that I've never seen you three without your makeup before.
Okay, Geoffrey, fine.
A question for you.
"If you could use a voodoo doll to hurt anyone you chose, would you"?
Miss Ashley, if it hasn't worked by now - Aah!
- Perhaps it's kicking in.
No, I saw a mouse.
- Are you sure?
- Of course, I'm sure.
What'd it look like?
Like Mickey, only without the big white gloves.
- Oh, my God.
I see it!
- Geoffrey, get it!
- Which way did it go?
That way!
Thank you.
No.
All right.
First, I'll take odds on my point.
Give me a 12-dollar six and eight, Give me five on the come, five in the field.
Keep my hard ways working for me.
Oh, yeah.
Split me up $10.
Boxcars and yo.
And here's a buck.
Spread it around.
Give me them.
Give me them.
Give me them.
Nine.
Winner.
Whoo!
Give me the loot.
Give me the loot.
I'm a bad, bad man.
All right.
All right.
Show me 20.
Show me 20.
Show me 20.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Oh, come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
All right, come on.
It's your turn.
Roll them, C. All right, fine.
Come to papa.
Come on, aren't you gonna bet something?
Yes, I put $5 on red and 5 on black.
That'll cancel your bet out.
You can't win like that.
Maybe so, but I can't lose either.
- Not unless it comes up  Double zero, green.
One penny, two penny, three No, better not take the chance.
Yes, I've got it.
Hey.
Hey, Carlton.
Oh, man, you are never gonna believe this.
Let me tell you, I'm at this crap table, right?
It's crazy.
I'm just barking numbers like, boom, seven, boom, 11.
The crowd is going crazy.
The girls are like, "Willy Smith, is that you"?
I'm like, "Who you think it is"?
They're going crazy.
They all love me.
I'm throwing back doors, yos, Little Joes, all that kind of stuff.
I'm just straight jacking the casino for their loot.
Man, I was like a crap Mandingo.
- So, what happened?
- Hey, can you spot a brother 20?
I cannot believe you froze me up right in the middle of my comeback.
Hi, my name is Will Smith, and I'm a gambleholic.
Carlton, come on, man.
Didn't you feel the juice?
Will, that's the devil's juice.
I'm about to have me some of the devil's eggs and bacon too.
Ha!
Very funny, Will.
Now hand it over.
- What?
- You were right there when Dad said it.
"Keep an eye on Will.
Make sure he doesn't get out of control.
Make sure he doesn't drink the devil's juice".
Man, he ain't say none of that.
You are so far gone.
Now hand over all your money.
Is that gonna shut you up?
Yes.
Now let's get some shuteye.
Look, man, I ain't tired.
Do you want to miss Hoover Dam?
Hoover Dam.
I don't wanna see no damn Hoover Dam.
It's more beautiful than I thought.
It is mauve.
Hey, Carlton.
Carlton.
Come on, eight, eight, eight.
I need an eight.
I want an eight.
Eight.
Eight.
Eight.
Give me an eight.
Carlton, what the hell are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm gambling.
What do you think?
Come on, eight.
Carlton, you can't put all your money on one number.
And the winner is eight.
Yes!
Eight.
I won.
I love you, man.
You know I always loved you, man.
Ha-ha-ha.
Place your bets.
- Hey, hey, so how much are you up?
- We're not up.
We're down.
What you mean "we"?
Well, after I maxed out all my credit cards Carlton, you maxed out all your credit cards?
I had to.
I couldn't get full value for the airline tickets.
You hocked our airline tickets?
Well, what do you expect?
I only got $200 out of your ATM card.
A word to the wise, Will, never leave your PIN number in your wallet.
You took my wallet?
Carlton, how much is left?
- Whatever's left on the table.
- Wait a minute.
Aah!
- And the winner is eight - Yes!
teen.
- No!
No, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
It was 18, we had eight.
We should get something.
What a rush.
You feel that?
What a ride.
Carlton, you lost all our money.
Oh, please.
I'm not ready to come down just yet.
What the hell were you thinking, man?
I was so excited about going to Hoover Dam, I couldn't sleep.
So I figured I'd come down and place a little harmless bet and I won.
You know, I tried to walk away but the crap table just kept calling me.
"Carlton.
Carlton".
And then the blackjack table was saying, "You can do it".
And then the slot machines just started yelling: "Hey, you tall handsome guy, come shake my hand".
These are all my new friends.
My God, they're pumping a lot of oxygen into this room.
That was the worst night of my life.
Tossing and turning, thinking about that mouse.
What are you complaining about?
I'm the one who caught it and got rid of it.
Mommy, Ashley's bothering me.
Ashley, stop bothering your sister.
- Big baby.
- She did it again.
We have the whole day to ourselves without men.
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Go to the mall and scam on guys.
See, Mom, she is so immature.
It's Saturday, the guys are at the gym.
I think the whole point of this is for us to bond without men.
- Can we talk about men?
- No.
- Not even negatively?
- What you got?
Okay, tell me something.
Now, are all men hard of hearing or is it just that they don't wanna listen to anything we have to say?
Right.
We have to listen until we're blue in the face about cars, sports money, their precious careers, and then if we wanna talk about something that's really important to us, they can't be bothered.
Wait, how about this?
How about when they never listen?
Heh.
Wow, Will, the casino's head office.
Can't you just feel the money?
I mean, my God, look at all the animal heads in here.
Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of a hat.
- Shut up, Carlton.
- Ow!
Now, come on, the only way that my plan is gonna work is if you follow my instructions to the letter.
- Great.
What are the instructions?
- "Shut the hell up".
- Hello, gentlemen.
- How you doing?
Will Smith.
Pleasure.
I understand you gentlemen would like to discuss a little business.
Heh.
A little?
Pshh.
We got something that is gonna rock your world.
- Rock away.
- All right.
Well, you know, we were talking - Have a seat.
- Oh.
We were just walking around in your beautiful casino you know, fully caught up in the magic and the fun and the excitement and we suffered a minor cash-flow problem.
I feel your pain.
- Listen, "Fred".
I can call you Fred, right?
- Sure.
My associate and I, we wanna make you a very, very rich man.
Too late.
He said, "Too late".
He put the ring up.
You know, he said, "Too late".
You know, I like this guy.
No, no, but seriously, you know Now, are you familiar with the term "money making money"?
- Sure.
- Let me paint you a little picture.
Now, we're out and we're hanging around in your delightful casino.
I mean, we are shooting craps and we're playing cards and the crowd is excited.
I mean, they are really excited.
And they're saying to themselves: "Wow, look at these guys.
They're losing, but look how much fun they're having".
And then it hits them.
Losing is more fun than winning.
They're saying to themselves, "Wow, how can we get in on the fun"?
Before you know it, people start talking, and they're saying: "Hey, honey, go ahead, draw to the inside straight.
You got 20, so what?
Hit it".
People at the crap tables, "Come on, snake eyes.
Let's go, snake eyes".
People will come to your casino to lose.
Huh?
Ching-ching.
Huh?
You can feel the electricity, can't you?
You can feel it, right?
Oh, yeah.
I feel it.
I knew you would.
You know, I mean, there's one hitch though.
I mean, we're out in the casino, we're working our tail off for you and we lost all our money.
Oh, so you want your money back?
That is why you are you.
You deserve every one of them heads, Fred.
Carlton, you taking notes from this man?
Y'all taking notes from this man?
So then it's settled.
Chips are fine.
Uh Is there anything else?
Well, I don't know.
I wouldn't mind catching a show.
- Just name it.
- Tom Jones.
Who?
You know what?
Never mind.
Never mind.
So where do we go from here?
Are you gonna give it to us or should we go out to the cashier?
Basically, where we go from here is that I'm gonna count to three and if you gentlemen are not out of my office, I've got space for you on my wall.
I still don't know what happened.
I mean, I went into the desert just like my father said.
I had my knife.
But how is a brave suppose to concentrate with all these bells and whistles?
Not to mention the keno girls.
How am I gonna call my father and tell him I'm an utter and absolute failure?
I don't think it's gonna be the shock that you think it is.
Well, at least I know it's over.
The insanity is done.
I'm Carlton again.
- Carlton, look, a quarter.
- Oh, it's mine.
It's mine.
You're pathetic.
You're right.
I've hit rock bottom.
How come you can see the quarter and I can't?
Because there ain't no quarter, man.
Now get on the phone and call Uncle Phil.
Will, it's a sign.
You're an imbecile, but we still have to call Uncle Phil.
- But you don't understand.
- Carlton It's a dance contest and I'm a dancing machine.
Huh?
Huh?
Wow, the competition's even stiffer than I thought.
Please.
My mom got better moves than that the time her girdle slipped in Church.
All right.
Okay, thank you.
That was rad.
We're gonna welcome our next contestants all the way from Bel-Air, California.
Please welcome Will the Thrill and Boogaloo Shrimp.
Tonto Jump on it Jump on it Jump on it Kemosabi Jump on it Jump on it Jump on it Custer Jump on it Jump on it Jump on it Apache Jump on it Jump on it I'm Big Bank I am the Chief I got a lot of raps But I'll be real I never need a horse I like to chill  We were up, we were down, we were all around and suddenly out of nowhere, they just ripped our hearts out.
Look, see, it doesn't matter how many bruises and scars you got.
The important thing is you came out of that desert alive, and a man.
A very odd little man, but a man.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
I just wish we could've won that dance contest.
I mean, how dare they give us the booby prize.
Hey look, man, that booby prize paid our way home.
Trust me, Will, I will never gamble again.
ALL : Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Carlton Happy birthday to you  Okay, son, make a wish.
Hey, Carlton, bet you can't blow them all out.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I got 20 that says I can.
Hey, Will, you want some action on this?
I can beat you.
I'll blow it out.
- You're not in Vegas anymore.
- You wanna bet on this?
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Shh!
Shh!
What the hell are you doing down here?
Oh, um, I thought I heard somebody breaking in.
What you doing down here?
Uh, the same thing.
Pie's in the fridge.
Yep.
Nothing like sneaking a little pie before Thanksgiving.
- Shh!
Shh!
- Don't shush me.
This is not the first Philip Banks pie-jacking.
Son, son, I have been jacking pies since, what, Thanksgiving 1953.
Rhubarb.
Tart little thing.
From then on, the dog ate the pie.
Hey.
So I guess it's your nose I should've been shoving in the pan.
Well, actually, keeping his nose out of the pan would have been more of a punishment.
Get off of me.
Mother.
My sweet Mommy.
Come on, Mom.
Ha-ha-ha.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
I have been stashing away a pie or two ever since I saw the size of your sweet tooth.
Oh.
Grandma Hattie, the pie hider.
Aah!
- I suppose the dog ate this one too.
- I ain't had nothing to do with it.
- He ate it.
- You always trying to blame somebody.
- Out of here.
Both of you.
- Momma.
- Just out of the kitchen.
Out.
- He did it.
Out.
Out.
Out.
Well, it's off to the shelter.
Oh, honey.
I think it's wonderful that you're helping the less fortunate on Thanksgiving.
I guess.
Did I tell you that Channel Four is sending a camera crew down to cover this?
God knows that The Hilary Show could use some publicity.
There is no limit to your giving, is there, Miss Hilary?
Thank you, Geoffrey, that's so sweet.
All set?
I'm not going.
Wait.
Carlton, didn't you call down to the shelter and volunteer?
I called down and put my name on a volunteer list.
But I'm not physically going down there.
But don't worry, it'll still look good on my résumé.
Carlton, if you said you were going down to help, you get down there.
But, Mom, I can't drive through that part of town.
There are homeless people down there.
Okay, fine.
But before I go, I'm taking the pennies out of my loafers.
Hey, where they at?
Hey.
Oh, my goodness.
You get prettier every year, sweetie.
It's like looking in a mirror.
Carlton.
I'm sorry we have to go, but they're expecting us down at the shelter.
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.
We'll see you later.
- All right.
Bye-bye.
All right, all right.
Hear that, Vy?
They're off to help at the shelter.
- Oh.
- Isn't she a saint?
A regular Mother Teresa.
How was the trip?
- Oh, well, a little bumpy.
- Turbulence?
No, no, no.
For five hours straight, Helen never stopped moving.
Well, that's why I've always had a boyfriend.
You know that's right.
Hattie girl, you look younger every time I see you.
Oh, you're just saying that.
Oh, but don't feel you have to stop.
Hi, Aunt Vy.
Hi, Aunt Helen.
- Ashley.
- Oh, Ashley, sweetie pie.
- Hello.
- How you doing?
I guess you're gonna be rolling up those sleeves and helping us in the kitchen?
I can't wait to get elbow deep in them turkey gizzards.
Honey, you need to get cable.
Just because I'm a woman, I'm suppose to don an apron on Thanksgiving?
I don't think so.
Well, I guess somebody burned their training bra.
Aunt Helen, you ever heard of traveling light?
And that's probably just her makeup.
- Oh, sweetie, is it your back?
- Yeah.
I told you the pressures of that trial were gonna get to you.
- Are you okay, son?
- Yeah.
I'll be all right, Momma.
Good.
Now, get that trunk out of here.
We need this space to cook in.
And I gotta get back to my stuffing.
Wait, no.
You made the stuffing last year.
That's because you were sick.
This is my natural turn.
Well, wait a minute.
It's my turn to make it after you.
Okay.
Now you're guests in my house.
I'll make the stuffing.
Besides, everybody loves it.
Funny, I don't remember voting.
Uh, no offense, you guys but none of you can hold a candle to my stuffing.
That's because it's so dry, it'd go up in flames.
All I know is, I've been making my stuffing for Philip since he was a boy.
And he always asks for more.
Oh, we all know what a picky eater he is.
Now, Will.
Will.
You grew up on my stuffing.
Now, you tell everybody who's the best.
- Oh, well, come on, Mom - Uh-uh-uh!
Excuse us.
Son.
Son, come here.
Let me give you a little piece of advice, huh?
Never take sides when women are arguing.
You can't win.
Well, Uncle Phil, this is my mom.
I think it'll be all right.
Look at me, boy.
Lesson number one, whatever you say is wrong.
We're all family here, Uncle Phil.
I don't think it's quite that serious.
Well, Mom, I think that your stuffing is the best in the world.
- Yes.
- What?
Oh, I mean I'm saying At least that's what I thought before I tried Grandma Hattie's herb stuffing.
Whoo!
Hey, what is it in there, the rosemary that just drives me crazy?
What?
Um Well, I mean, nothing compares to Aunt Helen's mushroom and bacon stuffing.
Ain't that right, Uncle Phil?
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Will?
Well, Aunt Viv.
I mean, when I first tried your apricot stuffing I was like, "Whoo"!
Ain't that right, Uncle Phil?
Heh.
You gonna leave me hanging out here like this, huh?
How about y'all make them all?
- That's a good idea.
- Hey, yes.
- Okay, I'm for that.
- I guess I'll get to cook this year.
And you can judge which is best.
The both of you.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever seen so many fashion don'ts in one room?
Okay, Hill.
Look, here's the plan.
We get in, do our good deed and get out.
Great.
Wait, I don't see the camera crew anywhere.
- Excuse me.
Could you help me?
- The food's over there.
But I'll save a seat for you.
Beauty is such a curse.
Relax.
You have to be patient with these people.
Understanding.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, pal.
Can't you see I'm talking?
I'm Larry Wilmore.
The shelter manager.
Manager?
Carlton Banks here.
Wow, you're awfully young to have such an important position.
And fit too.
You work out, don't you?
So, Lare, listen.
I've taken the liberty of drafting up a little letter of recommendation.
So if you'd be kind enough to put your John Hancock The film crew called and they said they're gonna be a little delayed.
But in the meantime, Sylvia over there will give you your jobs.
Oh, don't be silly.
I already have a job.
I'm a famous talk-show hostess.
Well, not exactly famous but I would be if more people watched my show.
But really, how famous was Oprah before she was famous?
Sylvia.
Uh, Hilary and Carlton need their assignments.
And I suddenly need my medication.
Excuse me.
We'll talk later, Lare.
Okay.
Here you go.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm already fully accessorized.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, man.
He can't catch a cold.
Phil, I need you and Will to move that luggage upstairs.
Relax.
Relax.
Right after this play, sweetheart.
That should give us at least another half hour.
You know, I once told her that the Fiesta Bowl was a three-day event.
I didn't have to do anything all weekend.
Nicky, we are learning from the master.
Holidays are the reason they should've passed the ERA.
Give it a rest.
Ooh.
The student has become the teacher.
All right.
Vy, I'm gonna need this area to chop up my onions.
No, no, no.
Not before I chop up my parsley.
I don't want your onions ruining my stuffing.
Believe me, you don't need my onions to ruin your stuffing.
Children, please.
Just like you, moving in on somebody.
You're the one to talk.
I had my own room before you came along.
Why don't you let that go?
You hold on to things like a rottweiler.
Now, why did you have to go there?
What are you talking about, "holding on to something"?
I'm glad I never had daughters.
Just push your little onions right over there.
You can't make no  Did you move that luggage yet?
We'll get it right after this play, Aunt Viv.
Now!
What'd I do wrong?
You didn't believe.
- Come on, let's get this big piece first.
- All right.
Count of three, Uncle Phil.
- Okay.
Take it easy now.
- All right.
Ready?
Okay.
One, two  Oh, come on, man.
Look at this stu I don't believe this guy.
Mommy, Daddy's fallen and he can't get up.
What happened?
Philip, what happened?
Oh, my back.
My back went completely out.
Oh, honey, I'll call the doctor.
Why didn't you lift?
Uncle Phil, you never said, three.
I did say three.
I said, one, two, three.
No, you didn't, Uncle Phil.
You said, "One, two".
But then when I said, three.
Oh, God.
I just need to lie down.
- Here.
Let me give you a hand.
- Don't touch me.
Philip, honey, what happened in here?
Oh, my poor baby.
Can I get you anything?
I'll take a gin and tonic.
Could somebody put a pillow under my legs, please?
Of course.
HATTIE & VY &  Oh, my stuffing.
Honey, I just talked to Dr. Selkin.
He can't see you until Monday morning.
His physical therapist is available tomorrow.
Oh, well, I guess I just have to wait, then.
Oh, honey, just lay here.
If you need anything, I'll be in the kitchen.
You cannot trust those women.
Oh, no, but, Viv Viv Vivian, you just Get away from me.
Look, Uncle Phil, you're obviously in pain, man.
Why wait until tomorrow?
I say we hop in the car, head down to one of them acu-pressure places.
I don't think so.
Yeah, yeah.
You're probably right, Uncle Phil.
And, you know, tonight, while we're all in the dining room having turkey and four different kinds of stuffing and mashed potatoes and sweet potato pie, cranberry sauce - Ooh, ooh, ooh.
And little tiny onions swimming in a sea of cream sauce.
Yeah, you gonna be right here on the couch.
But that's all right.
Don't worry about it.
I'll have a word with Geoffrey.
Have him mix you up, like, a turkey smoothie.
Well Well, now, Will, l I am in pain.
Yeah, that's right, Uncle Phil.
Let's get in the car, let's head down there.
Okay, okay.
Careful now.
- All right.
On three.
- Count of three.
Okay.
Ready?
One, two, three.
- Oh, come on.
- Aah!
That time, you definitely said three.
Hey, can you hook me up with some more potatoes?
Move it along.
Everyone gets the same amount.
But I'm a growing boy.
Just because somebody stunted your growth doesn't mean you need to take it out on me.
Is that a short joke?
Why, did it go over your head?
Now, that was a short joke.
Look, you mangy little rapscallion Hey, Mr. Wilmore.
I'm just giving the customers what they want.
How about some more turkey, young fella?
Just tell me when.
What are you doing?
This food has to feed everybody.
For somebody who wants to go to Princeton, I'd expect more common sense.
Hey.
Maybe you ought to look into community college.
Hold on, there.
I ain't done yet.
Wait.
Ain't you that beautiful lady from before?
Oh, yes, I am.
Damn, baby.
Look like somebody hit you with an ugly stick.
Sylvia, you can tell Mr. Wilmore that I quit.
Is that what you want me to tell the news crew when they show up?
You wouldn't.
Try me.
This isn't fair.
Oh, please don't be mean to me.
Well, I guess you don't have to be any kind of actress to be a talk-show host.
Great, a critic.
I don't see why you're making me clear dishes.
You wanna wash?
That's a good one.
No, I was thinking of something more along the line of hostessing.
I could greet the people as they come in with a smile and hand them their menus and take them to their seats.
- Clear.
- I'll split my tips with you.
- Clear.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Now, come on.
Come on.
Take it easy.
Take it easy.
Hey, hi.
Let's go here and let's lay you down on the couch so you can get comfortable.
- Okay.
All right, we're gonna go down on the count of three.
You ready?
I'm gonna go ahead and let you take your own count.
- Don't touch me.
- All right.
Hey.
How you doing?
May I help you?
Actually, it's for my uncle, you know?
He needs a deep-tissue massage.
As you can see, the brother do got some deep tissue.
You know what I'm saying?
You know?
What about you?
Oh, no, no.
I'm cool.
I'm all right, thanks.
I'll give you the massage personally.
Actually, I do got a kink right in here, you know.
Very tight.
Is dinner ready yet?
Not quite, honey.
Almost.
Well, can't you just hit me with a little somethin'-somethin'?
Not until dinner, honey.
Aw, man.
Yes.
I make this stuffing for all my men.
And they always come back for more.
Yeah, because they forgot their shoes.
You're just jealous, Vy.
Jealous because I'm fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Well, I've been told that I'm very sexy.
Nine hundred numbers don't count.
Geoffrey.
What do you think?
Who's more desirable?
It's a tie.
You both lose.
Oh, Ashley, honey, would you like to help?
Help set women back a hundred years?
No, thank you.
Oh, shut up, Ashley.
Just my luck.
There's some fire that's delayed the news crew.
They might not make it here.
Oh, you just can't catch a break, can you?
You do understand.
Oh, who asked you, anyway?
Hey, uh, I didn't get you in trouble with the old man, did I?
Move it along, rat boy.
And I didn't mean anything by the short crack.
Isn't there a vending machine you should be kicking over or some other havoc you should be wreaking?
Oh, I see.
Just because I'm in a place like this, I should be committing crimes?
What kind of a narrow-minded elitist view of the world do you have?
You come down here once a year, give a guy a couple slices of turkey and all of a sudden you think you're better than he is?
I didn't mean anything by it.
I had you going.
You're a gullible little fellow, aren't you?
Today is your lucky day.
You get a choice of body oils.
We have cinnamon, honeysuckle and our holiday special, cranberry.
Do you have anything a little lower in cholesterol?
Baby, you could use Pennzoil, olive oil hell, you can even buff me up with some Turtle Wax.
I don't care.
Just work it, girl.
Oh, this is heavenly.
Oh!
Oh, that's definitely the right spot.
Oh, that is definitely my spot.
How you living over there, Uncle Phil?
I believe the correct term is large.
How about you?
Oh, it is all good.
Would you like the special?
Baby, I will take the special with a side of coleslaw and some extra biscuits.
One special coming right up.
Will, we're getting out of here.
Uh, yeah, Uncle Phil.
You go ahead and warm the car up.
I'll be out in about 10 minutes.
Now!
Call me.
You call me.
- I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
- No big deal.
- Freeze.
Oh!
Yeah, maybe this is a big deal, Uncle Phil.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: It's off to the shelter.
Oh, honey, I think it's wonderful that you're helping less fortunate on Thanksgiving.
Sylvia, you can tell Mr. Wilmore that I quit.
Is that what you want me to tell the news crew when they show up?
- You wouldn't.
- Try me.
- Two - Oh, come on, man!
- Aah-aah-aah!
Oh!
- Look at this guy.
I can't believe this guy.
Mommy, Daddy's fallen and he can't get up!
One special coming right up.
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
- This ain't no big deal.
- Freeze!
Maybe this is a big deal, Uncle Phil.
Well, well, well, what do we have here?
- It's an honor, Your Honor.
- Ha-ha-ha.
That's very amusing, Hendricks.
Why don't you save us all a lot of trouble and just drop this nonsense?
It's not up to me to drop it only the DA can make that call, but I thought you'd know that.
Look, the DA is not gonna file on this.
- It's garbage.
Nothing happened.
- Ah.
Well, we can't say nothing happened, Uncle Phil.
You know, there was a couple of butt-naked honeys scattered around that place.
When the press gets ahold of this, they're gonna have a field day.
Lock them up.
Oh, all right, I guess you just gonna do us like this, huh, bro?
Just like that?
I guess you wasn't at the Million Man March, huh?
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
This cell ain't full yet.
Hold up, hold up.
My back.
My back.
All right.
Mm.
Mm, mm.
Another year, another hairdo.
Who you trying to catch, Hattie?
I guess you and Will gonna be hitting one of them all-night Thanksgiving jams, huh?
Oh, girl, that boy couldn't keep up with me if I gave him a head start.
I've got one more outside.
I'll go get it.
He's a hunk.
Yeah.
Did you see the way he was looking at me?
Girl, that man wasn't looking at you, he was looking at me.
Tsk.
Looking at me like it was lunchtime and my legs was Colonel Sanders' extra crispy.
Wasn't he, Geoffrey?
If you mean something fast and cheap, yes.
I'm Skippy.
Skippy.
What's up?
Uncle Phil, they cannot make these charges stick, man.
You said that yourself.
Will you be my friend?
Um No.
- Wait, Uncle Phil, where you going?
- I'm gonna call my lawyer.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uncle Phil, you might know your way around the mean streets of Bel-Air but I think you better let me handle this brother on the phone, all right?
Hold up.
Yo, bro, phone check.
Hey, look, we got an important call to make.
What's the big deal anyway?
It wouldn't be the first time you broke somebody's legs.
All right.
I love you too, Mama.
You want the phone?
Uh Y-yes, please.
It's yours.
It's for you.
Those don't go there.
- Yes, they do.
You said before - No, I told you those go in the back.
I should expect that from someone who's probably never cleaned a dish in their life.
What's your problem?
From the first second I got here, you've been on me like I've done something wrong.
Maybe I don't come to places like this and do this kind of work as often as I could.
And maybe sometimes I say things that sound insensitive and self-centered but that's who I am, damn it.
It doesn't make me a bad person.
Just because you volunteer more days a year than I do doesn't mean you're better than me.
I didn't volunteer at all.
Oh, so you're paid to be here.
Honey, I live here.
So the plates go in the back?
That's it.
There's nothing left.
What do you mean?
- I'm sorry, folks.
We're out.
Aww.
This is terrible.
How did this happen?
There's just so many more mouths than there is money to feed them.
You had some letter you wanted me to sign.
Oh, yeah.
I wanna thank you both very much for your time and your help.
Happy Thanksgiving.
I'm thinking that in a week when we look back on this, we are just gonna laugh.
Maybe two weeks.
- I got it.
Edison Field, fall of 1967.
- That was the Dartmouth game.
Tiny Williams.
Oh.
And you're Big Phil Banks.
How you doing?
Wait a minute, so you guys are old college buddies.
Hey, it's a good thing, man I thought we was gonna have to Bruce Lee you up in here, you know?
Skippy?
Oh.
I haven't seen you since you had your accident in the big game.
That was no accident at all.
That was clipping.
That's not what the referee said.
What about that shot to the helmet during the last play?
What was that?
A shot to the helmet?
Oh  So how you been?
Man, my knee was never the same after that game.
Lost my scholarship, had to leave school, and then I got drafted.
Ended up with a head full of shrapnel.
Couldn't hold a job once I got back.
So to make a few bucks, I drove a friend's car a cross-country for him.
What he didn't tell me was there was 40 pounds of pot in the trunk.
I did 10 hard years, and finally got out.
But after that, my life started to go bad.
How about you, Banks?
About the same.
Why aren't you talking?
I'm not, not talking.
I'm just not talking.
- Why aren't you talking?
- I am talking.
I'm the one who just asked a question.
You're the one not talking.
Having to participate in this inane conversation would keep anyone from talking.
Well, I think you're feeling guilty and that's why you're not talking.
What in the world would I have to feel guilty about?
You profited from another's misfortune.
You're the one who went to the shelter to get the free publicity.
You're the one with a letter of recommendation in his pocket.
Face it, you're a taker.
I'm a taker?
Miss "Daddy, can I have $300"?
Right, Mr. "Hey, Big Guy can I have a copy of your will in case something happens to you"?
That's called prudent planning.
Yeah, if your last name's Menendez.
- You're doing it again.
- What?
Not talking.
Your guilt will consume you.
See, you're a nag.
That's exactly why you don't have a boyfriend.
And you're a taker.
- Nag.
- Taker.
- Nag.
- Taker.
- Nag.
- Taker.
- Nag.
- Watch the road!
I wonder why Philip and Will are so late.
Well, maybe they pulled in, smelled your stuffing and turned back around.
Ha-ha-ha.
Now, that's a good one.
Ha-ha-ha.
Of course, yours ain't no better.
It's just like men.
They're probably at some sports bar puffing cigars, watching football on a big screen completely disregarding the years of suffering that women Shut up, Ashley.
I really am worried about Philip and Will.
Trust me, my son would never miss Thanksgiving dinner.
It's the holiday.
Settle in, boys.
Nobody's going anywhere tonight.
There's a bug on mine.
You know, a few hours ago, my biggest problem was judging a stuffing contest.
Now look at me.
Stuck in a jail cell with some angry You clipped him, didn't you?
I'm sorry, Uncle Phil.
- It's the worst Thanksgiving I ever had.
- Heh.
And thank you so much for sharing it with me.
Look at us.
All hungry.
I'm about to dig in to this cream-of-bug sandwich.
And our family sitting around the dining-room table big gorgeous roasted turkey four different kinds of stuffing.
Candied yams, and macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes.
And little tiny onions swimming in a sea of cream sauce.
Hendricks!
Listen, Banks, if it's a sandwich you're after, they're all gone.
In the first place, it's not "Banks" it's "Your Honor".
Now you get your butt over to that telephone and you pull the district attorney from whatever meal he may be eating and you tell him that you have Judge Philip Banks in jail under a bogus charge.
And you might wanna mention the fact that we have been denied due process.
A phone call, access to legal representation and every other conceivable right guaranteed to us by the constitution.
Don't forget to mention that no statements have been taken no witnesses interviewed, and none of the most fundamental procedures that the newest rookie on a beat would know, have been followed.
My nephew and I are completely innocent, and if you don't take care of this it will be you having your picture taken with numbers across your chest.
And we want $10,000 in unmarked bills and a helicopter on the roof gassed up and ready to take us to Tijuana.
Oh, sorry.
I just kind of got caught up in the moment.
Okay, get your peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Grape jelly?
You can't make these with no damn grape jelly.
- Hi, everybody.
We're back.
Aww Surprise!
Hey, hey, hey.
- So, what do you think?
- A caterer for Thanksgiving dinner.
I think it's just as snooty and stuck-up as you can get.
But I think it's great.
- Everybody's having a good time.
- Oh!
Yeah.
That is, until it's time for me to do the dishes.
Sylvia, let me take care of the dishes.
My butler, Geoffrey, can be here in 15 minutes.
Ha-ha.
How about if we do them together?
Then what'll Geoffrey do?
Hey, look.
It's a little turkey from the little turkey.
Heh-heh.
A turkey?
Hardly.
In point of fact, it's a Cornish game hen.
A flightless bird hale from the Isle of Wight.
Braised in cognac with a hint of fennel.
A fitting end for a noble fowl.
You're kind of weird.
So you want one or not?
No, I probably shouldn't have one, Mr. Wilmore said You know what?
This one's on me.
Cool.
So you gonna be here over Christmas?
Yeah.
Sorry, we're late.
This is going to make a great holiday piece, Hilary.
The public eats up this kind of stuff.
Oh.
- Oh.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
- What?
I exploit people every day of the week on my show.
It's Thanksgiving, I'm gonna take the day off.
Well, I hope the fire's still burning.
- That was really something.
- I know.
I wasn't the least bit opportunistic.
For the first time in my life, I thought about others instead of myself.
Ooh.
I'm tingling all over.
- I'm really proud of you, Hil.
- Oh, thank you.
So are you gonna tear up that letter of recommendation?
Oh, Carlton, I'm so proud of you too.
Judge Banks.
Shh.
I'm really sorry, Your Honor.
Yeah.
Just tell your boy he'd better be at the next march.
Your limo is here and it's ready to take you and your nephew home.
There's no charges, there's no publicity, and there's no reporters.
No hard feelings?
No chance.
Hey, Banks?
You done all right for yourself, man.
- Take care of yourself, Tiny.
- I'll see you on the outside, brother.
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Same to you.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Oh, hey, what are we gonna tell Aunt Viv?
Will, Will, here's another very important lesson.
When you have a chronic back problem and you go for a therapeutic massage and wind up in a house of ill-repute, which is subsequently raided and you are arrested by mistake never tell your wife.
Hmm?
Poof.
Oh, you are definitely the master.
Let's go get some of them tiny onions.
I tell you, I really feel like I connected with those people down at the shelter today.
When I reached out to them, they reached back.
Of course, I stepped out of the way so they couldn't actually touch me but I really connected.
So, what'd you guys do?
Uh - Nothing.
- Yeah, nada, nadie, nil, nilch, nothing Ah!
Look at the bird!
You've outdone yourself, Geoffrey.
- It looks good.
- Yeah, right here.
Big bird.
Big bird.
- That is beautiful.
- It smells delicious.
Okay, everyone, let's join hands for the prayer.
Dear Lord, thank you for our many blessings.
Thank you for our health.
Thank you for this food.
But most of all, thank you for keeping us safe and delivering us from Tiny.
Tiny, as well as larger temptations.
And thank you for bringing this family together in love and peace.
- Amen.
Amen.
A-woman.
Oh - Let us get to grubbing.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, man.
- That was all so good.
- That was the best Thanksgiving ever.
- Absolutely.
So, what about the stuffing?
Oh, it was delicious.
Everything was delicious.
Everything was exactly as delicious as everything else.
So, honey, which one did you like best?
Like you're a young boy, right?
You're not gonna tell me which one you liked better?
- Nope.
- Nope.
What about you guys?
Nope.
Then why did we bust our butts cooking all day if you're not gonna give us an answer?
- Really.
Because that's all part of the fun of Thanksgiving.
I guess it was kind of fun when Vy dropped that bag of powdered sugar all over Helen.
Yeah, that was not funny to me.
And I'll never forget the look on Vivian's face when she got her apron caught in the food processor.
Yeah, talk about being led around by your apron strings.
It was even fun giving you guys a hard time all day.
It doesn't matter whose stuffing was best it was just fun being in that kitchen together.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, I love y'all too but the bottom line is my stuffing was the best.
Any fool can see that.
You tasted it.
You tasted it with your own mouth.
Slaving in that No, I was slaving in that kitchen all day.
I know who I am.
I don't care if y'all leave the table.
Happy Thanksgiving to you too.
Every man I cook for likes what I cook.
That's right.
I'm all right.
I'm getting out of here.
Hah.
I'm going somewhere for Christmas.
Hah.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
There's nothing quite like putting up Christmas decorations.
Yeah.
Hey, what you want for Christmas, Granny?
Oh, at my age, you don't need much.
Just the love of your family.
Oh.
Cool.
Hey, but at my age, you need a little more.
Listen, you mind taking a look at this here?
I know you got a little pull with the big guy, you know so I was hoping you'd put in a word for me.
Hey, just let him know that the few times that I have been naughty, it was real nice.
You know what I mean?
Heh, heh.
Carlton, what are you doing?
Mom said while she was gone, I could decorate the tree.
No, Mom said while she was gone, I could decorate.
All right.
Carlton, you take one half of the tree.
Ashley, you take the other.
Fine.
Carlton, you can have the top half.
There's my Christmas cookies.
Oh, great, Geoffrey you're here.
And if I said I weren't, would you leave me alone?
You can't get me down, Geoffrey.
Not today.
Today is the happiest day of my life.
Until tomorrow, when my show goes national which will make that the new happiest day of my life.
That'll make today I get the pattern, Miss Hilary.
Then you'll hem these?
Great.
Geoffrey's on board.
Oh, Daddy, you're here.
Heh, heh.
Congratulations on your big day.
Oh, thank you.
Have you decided which TV you're gonna watch it on?
- Yeah.
This one right here.
- Great, great.
- Come on, sit down.
Sit down.
- Okay.
Okay.
Click.
Heh, heh.
Look, I'm on.
Let's practice.
How are you gonna watch me?
Oh, good, good.
Oh, this is so exciting.
Look, there I am interviewing some very important guests.
Heh, heh.
- Will, who's on the show tomorrow?
- A bunch of pregnant women.
Great, I'll look thin.
Not that I don't, anyway.
- Oh, I have a real knack for this.
- Yeah.
Oh, here's the remote.
Our patented big-girl panel gives you all the support you need.
And remember, maternity clothes don't have to be drab.
But beware, in that last trimester, stripes are not our friends.
Well, that's all the time we have on our first national show.
Thank you all for watching, and remember Bye.
Celebrate good times Come on  Whoo-hoo!
Oh, man.
Oh, Hil, you were slamming.
The show was kicking.
Werner, if you don't stop dancing, I'm about to get seasick.
I'm here with national talk-show hostess, Hilary Banks.
Hilary, how do you feel?
They like me.
They really like me.
Now, Hilary, now that you've reached this pinnacle this high-point in your career, what's left for you to accomplish?
How will you possibly top this?
Oh, that's easy.
I was thinking Well, um Well, I think that I'm goi Ugh.
No.
Well, maybe I can't top this.
Right.
Right.
My water broke.
WILL : Oh, okay.
Excuse me, I'm a doctor.
- Okay, have a seat.
All right.
All right.
Cool.
Now, this is just like on ER, y'all.
All right, so just chill.
Everybody, just relax.
Hey, hey, how do you feel right now?
- Can somebody get this clown out of here?
- Allow me.
This is the happiest day of my life.
Whoa.
What a coincidence, Hil, this is the happiest day of your life too.
Your show just went national.
I know.
Don't I look happy?
Hey, Spike Lee.
We gotta clear a path, let this woman out of here.
Whoo!
It's the good doctor.
Congratulations, doc.
Hey, put it there.
Hey, you know what?
Right after you wash that.
Hey.
Uncle Phil, what you think?
Oh, it's, uh, big.
Hey, you know, it's the perfect size for, like, I don't know a THX, Dolby Pro Logic, surround-sound subwoofer.
Uh, what's my odds?
- Laughing, that's a good sign.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Jingle bell, jingle bell Jingle bell rock Jingle bells swing And jingle bells ring Merry Christmas, everybody.
- Wait, wait, wait.
What is that?
- It's called flocking.
- It makes the tree look pretty.
- It makes it look cheesy and I won't have it on my tree.
Oh, your tree?
Let me tell you something, missy.
Get that flocking can away from me.
- How dare you speak to me like that?
- There's no way  That's your side of the tree.
I can do whatever I want to my side.
Ah.
- Granny, let a brother get a finger full.
- Get.
- Let a brother get a finger full.
- Get, get, get.
You know, l I just can't seem to get this bowl to stand still.
It might help if you put down the eggnog.
Worth a try.
You know, you're right.
- Hi, Grandma.
- Hi, honey.
I'm so glad you're here.
I need someone to talk to.
See, I just don't know what to do.
I was all set for today to be the best day of my life but it feels just like any other day.
And I have this empty feeling, you know, like something's missing?
Sure, I have an effervescent personality and a smile that could blind you from across the room but I just feel so blah.
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying something, honey?
You've gotta talk into my good ear.
I'm just happy that you're here for the holidays.
Okay, Hil, this is it.
Now, these promos are important so say it like you mean it, okay?
And action.
Good morning, KFNS in Phoenix, this is Hilary of the Hilary Show.
Be sure to watch us weekdays at 4.
Hilary, the idea of these promos is to attract an audience and make the show sound interesting.
Give it a little gusto, you know?
- Give it that Hilary pizzazz.
- Okay.
Hil, you could try a little something like this.
Good morning, KFNS in  Phoenix, Phoenix Phoenix, Phoenix This is the Hilary Show Phoenix, Phoenix Yeah.
Something in between what you did and whatever it was that he just did.
Okay.
Fine.
And action.
Good morning, KFNS in Phoenix, this is Hilary of the Hilary Show.
Be sure to watch us weekdays at 4.
Phoenix Was it better?
Just give it another try.
You know, my head really isn't into this right now.
Will, there's somewhere I'd like to go.
Could you take me?
- Yeah.
Sure, Hil.
- Okay.
Hil, couldn't you have said this with flowers?
WOMAN : Dr. King, dial 9.
We're not disturbing you, are we?
Is it okay?
Come on in.
Come on in.
I just thought I'd stop by and see the baby.
Well Oh, he's so cute.
Isn't he, Will?
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, bald head, pudgy.
If he had a beard, he'd look just like my Uncle Phil.
Ha, ha, ha.
Would you like to hold him?
Oh, yeah.
I do.
Let me hold him.
I wanna hold the baby.
- Careful.
Please, Hil.
Like I never held a baby before.
I know what I'm doing.
Whoa.
Hey, dude.
Hold up.
He tripping.
He tripping.
Oh, he's so cute.
Oh, look at his little nose.
Heh, heh.
And his little hands.
Hil, check it out.
Uncle Phil's hand.
Ha, ha, ha.
- How's the new mommy?
Feeling okay?
- Great.
Look at you.
You look so comfortable holding that baby.
Oh, really?
A baby will always tell you when he's in good hands.
And when he's hungry.
Ay!
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay.
You know, I just remembered I gotta go someplace, uh, where that's not happening.
- Hey, come on, Hil.
- Can't we just stay a little longer?
Well, I'm off my shift in 15 minutes.
I can give you a ride.
Okay.
Great.
Oh.
Remember, doc, no mouth-to-mouth on the first date, huh?
Ha, ha, ha.
Will.
Oh, it's like a hotel.
They expect you to take this stuff.
Have you taken the roast out of the oven yet, Geoffrey?
Show me again how it's done, Nana Hattie.
Oh, all right.
I love my job.
Mm-mm-mm.
Grandma Hattie's roast.
You know, a cow would be happy to be in your kitchen.
Boy, am I happy to be here.
Oh, great.
You're all here.
I have some really big news.
No news is bigger than my mother's roast.
I'm gonna have a baby.
Now, that would be bigger than the roast.
Daddy, you're gonna be a grandpa.
Daddy, say something.
Geoffrey, get the Scotch.
- It's gone, sir.
- What?
You've said my attitude has improved lately.
How could this happen?
It's the pressure, sir.
Phil, calm down.
Hilary, darling, this doesn't have to be bad news.
Having a child is a gift.
Now, come on, tell Grandma, who's the father?
I don't know.
Oh, dear God.
Ashley, take your grandmother upstairs.
Will, takes notes.
Come on, grandma.
Just how pregnant are you?
Who said I was pregnant?
I said I was gonna have a baby.
I think Aunt Viv must've dropped the ball on that little girl-girl talk.
Hilary, you're not making any sense.
I'm not pregnant yet.
I'm gonna go down to one of those fertility clinics and find a donor.
After Will and I went to the hospital, I realized what was missing in my life.
- I need a baby.
- Oh.
Heh, heh.
Are you insane?
Do you have any idea what having a baby entails, huh?
This is madness.
A baby is a lifetime commitment.
A commitment that a couple makes.
A baby is not a pick-me-up.
Scotch is a pick-me-up.
Damn that, Geoffrey.
Daddy, I didn't come here for your permission I came here for your blessing.
- This is your fault.
- Hey, man.
How you gonna blame me?
You're the one who took her to the hospital.
Therefore, it's your fault.
There.
Oh, forget it.
I don't know what I'm saying.
What am I gonna say to Vivian?
Uh "Hi, Grandma"?
Heh, heh.
Hoo.
Thanks for coming, Will.
It's really great to have your support.
No problem.
When you leave here there'll be no doubt in your mind what you wanna do.
Excuse me.
I'd like some information about your, um, inventory.
Are you looking for something specific?
What have you got in a hunk?
You'll be happy to know that our donors are screened very thoroughly.
We have everything from doctors to rocket scientists.
You wouldn't happen to have this month's, would you?
Sure.
Here you are, doctor.
Thank you.
We get lots of doctors.
Ugh!
I don't think so.
Hey, yo.
Thanks a lot, man.
- Glad I could be of service.
- Hey, come on, let's get out of here.
Uh I'll catch up to you later.
Thank you all for joining me on another journey of love, happiness and good cheer.
So until tomorrow, goodbye.
And remember Okay?
Whoo!
Hey, good show, Hil.
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.
Oh, what'd you expect?
Well, you know, after today, I kind of thought you Oh.
That was just a little setback.
I'm a trouper.
Girl, you are a super-duper trouper.
Well, I just hope my baby's a super-duper trouper too.
Heh, heh.
Huh?
- Baby?
Hey.
- You ready?
- Hey, what's up, doc.
What you doing?
Come back to deliver another baby, huh?
What, you get a commission on them?
No, I came to pick up Hilary.
Bye, Will.
On to plan B. So how do you like the food?
- It's delicious.
- Good.
I found this place the first year of my internship.
I was dying for food that didn't come out of a machine.
Heh, heh.
I spent some time in Milan and this place reminds me of a little restaurant near the Piazza Di Vani.
So any mental illness in your family?
Heh.
Excuse me?
Schizophrenia?
Anorexia?
You know, general weirdness?
Uh, not that I know of.
So tell me, what were you doing in Italy?
Shopping and studying Italian.
- So you speak Italian?
- Well, not exactly.
I did more shopping than studying, but it didn't matter I mean, they have translators in all those little shops.
So back to you.
Any heart disease?
Gingivitis?
Midgets?
No.
Any relatives in the circus?
Uh, not that I know of.
I mean I did have an uncle who was a clown.
Ew.
Duly noted.
Oh.
Aren't they so cute?
You're so lucky, you get to be around babies all the time.
Yeah, babies are great.
I can't wait to have a family someday.
How about you?
I suppose.
Oh, so you're not ready for babies, huh?
No, I'm definitely ready for a baby, it's just the family.
I mean I hadn't thought about it, I guess.
I don't understand.
I mean, how can you have one without the other?
Wait, wasn't I the one asking all the questions?
Want another hit?
Hit me.
Ah  What were we thinking about having kids?
What?
What?
I was wondering what life would've been like without the headaches of parenting.
Imagine that, if you ain't had no kids.
It'd just be you, Aunt Viv and me all by ourselves in this big house.
Ha, ha, ha.
Party, you know.
I saw the light on.
Can I talk to you, Daddy?
Oh, God, I don't wanna do this.
I wish I'd Daddy, please?
- Fine.
Will, will you excuse us, please?
- Oh, yeah.
Sure thing.
Hey, look, Uncle Phil, I just want you to know I got your back.
All right?
Anything jump off, all you got to do is holler - Goodbye, Will.
- All right.
Where did we go wrong?
Well?
You said you wanted to talk.
Daddy, I'm not gonna have a baby.
Oh, that's a relief.
I must tell you, this whole thing has been very upsetting.
It's been upsetting for me too.
I thought that the show going national was gonna change my life.
I mean, I had set certain career goals for myself and then when I reached them, I still felt empty.
Sweetheart, it's fine to have career goals it's wrong to assume that's all you need to make you happy.
I know.
That's why I thought I needed a baby.
Maybe I need a new car.
Oh, God, Hilary.
I'm kidding, Daddy.
Oh, God.
I don't have all the answers.
I wish I did, but I don't.
You know, it used to be so easy.
You'd cry, I'd buy you a bracelet.
You cried louder, maybe some earrings.
I miss those days.
Just remember happiness comes from inside.
Hm?
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, sweetheart.
- It's perfect.
- It's perfect.
- I was talking about my side.
- Your side?
Please.
I've seen better looking trees hanging from rearview mirrors.
Oh, please.
Your side looks like someone threw up on a snowman.
- Threw up on a snowman?
- Hey, hey, that's enough, you two.
All right, now, each side is very nice in its own way.
You really think so, Will?
Yeah.
I mean, you might've laid the flock on a little thick but other than that, it's very busy.
Not bad, Will.
Not bad.
I'm just kind of getting the hang of this parenting thing here, know what I mean?
Hey, Dad, I'm heading down to the mall.
Mind if I borrow a few bucks?
I'm sorry, I'm busted.
You're gonna have to get back with me later on that one.
You call that dusting, Geoffrey?
Give me that.
I'll do it myself.
God bless us, everyone.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Big Nick, what's up, man?
I'm working on the model I got for Christmas.
Oh, yeah, I wish I got a model for Christmas.
Mm!
Five-nine, 120.
Bloo-bloo-blap-blap!
Boom!
Wouldn't that be hard to put together?
I'm just kidding, Nick.
Don't worry.
Here, let me help you with this model.
It's pretty complicated, Will.
Please, boy, I was putting models together before you was born.
Come on, pass me that glue.
It's pretty strong stuff, Will.
Never in the history of pugilistic pursuit has one so completely dominated.
Muhammad, what do you have to say?
I'm the greatest and I'm pretty.
You know I made you, Howard.
What is going on here?
The family vowed to get in shape for the new year.
We gonna go to the gym.
I'm gonna take Nicky and put him in a boxing class.
Fine.
Just make sure he learns that boxing is about athleticism and sportsmanship, not violence.
Now I'm gonna get medieval on you.
We ain't really get to the sportsmanship part yet.
Well, hey, Uncle Phil, why don't you come to the gym with us?
Oh, I'd love to, I really would, but I have so much work to do on the trial this morning.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay, fine.
I'm not going because I don't want to.
And you can't make me.
So how do I look?
Hilary, we're going to the gym.
Oh, you're right, fluorescent lights.
I should put on more blush.
I'm a maniac, maniac on the floor I'm a maniac, maniac You're an idiot.
This is the latest design in workout wear.
Gore-Tex, breathable.
Specially designed to stop any riding up while on the stair climber.
So, what do you think?
I think you look like a family-size tube of Aquafresh.
Geoffrey, what do you think?
Honestly.
I think it's the most ridiculous costume I've ever seen.
I stand corrected.
Hey, Ashley.
All ready for your first day at work?
What was I thinking telling Daddy I'd pay for half my car?
I feel like a dork.
And I have to wear this same stupid uniform day after day after day.
Gee, wouldn't that suck?
Hey, hey, Nicky.
Got you all signed up for your boxing lesson.
- So I'll meet you over by the ring later?
- Okay.
I'm gonna float like a butterfly and stink like a bee.
That's close enough, all right.
Oh, yeah.
I'm already starting to feel the burn.
Tight as them pants are, you probably started a forest fire in your drawers.
- Excuse me, Will, I have a workout to do.
- Hey, Carlton, I was reading this.
It says here they have personal trainers.
Why don't you get one?
No need, Will.
Carlton Banks is gym savvy.
All right.
Ugh!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Get it off of me!
- Help!
- Hey, hey, hey.
You okay?
Me?
Of course, I'm fine.
I always scream like a girl when I'm working out.
Ha, ha, ha.
Stan Callahan.
I'm the gym's personal trainer.
Have you given any thoughts to private sessions?
Well, I don't really need a personal trainer.
As you can see, I've already got a good base.
Yeah, well, let's take a look.
Well, according to this, you're a can of Crisco.
But spread over a good base, right?
Hey, I think you're just right for the gold package, huh?
Gold?
- I think I like the sound of that.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Will, how do you turn these on?
- You gotta work them yourself, Hil.
- Oh.
Ew!
I'm starting to sweat.
Ninety-eight 99 100.
Argh!
Whoo!
That was a heck of a workout.
What do you say we hit the showers?
Okay, let's get you started with a little aerobic exercise just to get the heart rate up.
Sounds like a plan, Stan.
All right.
Okay, I'm gonna program it for a brisk walk and check on you in 10 minutes.
- All right.
Ah!
Yeah, well I don't know about you but I'm thinking after these hard workouts we both might need a little massage, you know.
What you say I bring the oils?
Oh.
Oh, no, no.
Hell, no.
Now, remember, a clean uniform is a happy uniform.
Ha, ha.
Okay.
Now, what's our motto?
I represent Dippity Do Dog the best doggone dog-dipping restaurant in the world.
Very good.
Now, I assume you've read the manual?
- Yes.
- Good.
- Dip a dog.
- Excuse me?
Dip.
Come on.
Dip, dip, dip.
Dip.
Nope, all wrong.
On page 27 of the manual it clearly states: "Dog must be dipped at a 60-degree angle and rotated until completely coated".
- Okay.
- Go ahead, try again.
All right.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Ew.
Oh, God, I'm so sor Oh!
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
- This won't happen again.
l - It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- We'll work up to the dogs.
- Okay.
- Let's start with the lemonade, okay?
Now, it's all in the rhythm.
Churn, baby, churn Ow!
Okay.
Now you try.
Okay.
No, no, no.
There's no rhythm.
Sing.
I don't want to sing.
Ashley, singing is what a Dippity Dog do.
Churn, baby, churn - That's it.
Lemon inferno Churn, baby, churn Okay, come on.
Ten more.
You can do it.
That's it.
Nine, eight.
Looking good, looking good.
Seven Whoo!
I am pooped.
- Pooped?
- Yeah.
I think it's time for a protein shake.
So, what'll it be?
Tutti-frutti?
Strawberry Sensation?
Come on, I'm buying.
You know, I got a better idea.
Why don't you get back to your workout, you no-good, yellow-bellied waste of skin!
Huh?
The only thing you'll be drinking is my boot if you don't get back on that machine, you no-good pansy!
I don't believe the gold package said anything about rudeness.
- Now!
- Ah!
- Push!
Two, three, four - Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
five, six, seven, eight.
- Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Stick and move.
Stick and move.
Keep your jab up.
Keep your jab up.
Good.
Okay, take a break, champ.
Ha, ha.
Big Nick, what's up, man?
How's your boxing lesson?
Great.
Helena said I was the best in the class.
Helena?
Wait a minute, you're the boxing instructor?
You got a problem with that?
Oh, no, no.
You know, cute little gloves, nice tight little outfit.
Works for you, cutie.
Now, there's a typical male attitude.
Oh, no, no, no.
No disrespect.
I'm just saying, you know, female boxers ain't exactly common.
Ain't nobody ever heard of Muhammad Ali Sheedy, you know.
You know, it's Sonny Liston, it's not Sonny and Cher Liston.
You know what I'm saying.
Sounds like you're saying you wanna put on some gloves and spar with me.
No.
How'd it sound like that?
Heh, heh, heh.
You don't want to?
Oh, no You know what?
My mom told me never hit a lady.
Because you're not fast enough?
Ah!
That's a good one.
That's a good one.
Now take it back.
- I don't think so.
- Ooh.
No need to go there.
Heh, heh.
- You're right.
- Ooh.
That one actually hurt a little.
- Look here, Helena, I was thinking - Ugh!
Shoot.
Now it's on.
All right.
- This is what you wanna do, huh?
- Mm-hm.
- This what you want, huh?
- Come on.
I'm about to give it to you.
Sneaking punches at me.
- Hit me, hit me.
Come on.
- I'm gonna hit you.
Hit me, come on.
I can't.
I can't.
Ugh!
- Ah!
Come on!
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Chicken, chicken.
- Come on.
- You're gonna die!
I don't feel right.
I don't  Come on.
- Okay.
Okay.
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, hit me.
Hit me.
Your mama.
Mama said knock you out.
Shh.
- Is that him?
- Yup.
Wow, I never seen a freak up close before.
He's not a freak.
He's just a wimp.
All right, that's enough.
Come on, you kids get out of here.
Go ahead, go on, get out.
Go, go.
Stop right there or I'll get my sister to come after you!
You bring your sister over here, I'll knock her block off!
Don't let them bother you, Master William.
You know, I once had a chum back in England who was in this identical predicament.
He too was being ridiculed by his peers for suffering defeat at the hands of a lady.
Oh, and he came through it all right?
How should I know?
You expect me to keep in touch with a wuss like that?
Hey, what happened to you?
Nazi trainer made muscles sore.
Ugh.
Dude, you look bad.
Could be worse.
Could be laughingstock of gym like you.
- So how you feeling, Will?
- Not great.
Son, there's a lesson to be learned here.
Just because you got defeated by a, heh, woman, doesn't make you any less of a man.
- Yeah, I know that, Uncle Phil.
- I can understand your being embarrassed by being clocked by someone half your size, but you'll get past it.
- I'm feeling better already.
- The sheer humiliation alone You know, I get it, Uncle Phil.
I just had the worst day of my life.
Well, at least I didn't get beat up by a girl.
How you doing?
What's going on?
Mind if I pedal with you?
That's my bike.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see your name on it.
I said, that's my machine.
Uh Look, why don't you go get a eucalyptus wrap and some facials and stuff?
Ow!
Argh!
Hey.
You messed up my count.
I hate it when people mess up my count.
Oh, no.
- While you're in here why don't you just work out, okay?
Here, hold this.
It's lover boy again.
What do you say we go for a little spin?
I have my whole agenda planned.
First, I have an apple wrap then a hot-oil massage, finishing with an aroma-therapy facial.
I'll be lucky if I'm able to walk tomorrow.
Well, today I have a little agenda of my own.
I'm telling Stan we're through, nada mas, kaputski.
Banks!
- Coming.
Banks, you're late.
Drop and give me 20.
Okay, but that doesn't leave much for yogurt.
I have to give you credit for showing up here again so soon.
Why?
I ain't got nothing to be afraid of.
What you doing with that towel, girl?
I mean, look, when I get through with Wonder Woman she gonna wonder why she messed with Will Smith in the first place.
Oh, my God, you're here to beat up a girl?
Oh.
Oh, well, no.
You know, I was just gonna rough her up a little bit.
Will.
Hey, you know, that's just a figure of speech, Hil.
So, what are you gonna do?
I'm I'm I'm I ain't gonna do nothing.
You know how to mess up all the fun, don't you?
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey!
What's up?
How you doing?
You know, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I didn't mean to pick on you like that.
What you mean, yesterday?
Oh!
Oh, yesterday.
You mean when you sucker-punched me.
No, no.
When I knocked you senseless.
You know, Helena, you actually said that like you believed it.
Oh, I did.
And I'm ready to do it again.
Why do you keep doing that?
Admit that you're afraid and I'll leave you alone.
Girl, let me tell you something.
Ain't nobody afraid of you.
You know, you have a real aggression disorder don't you?
- Oh, yeah?
- Ah!
Ah!
Is there anything else?
That was really impressive.
Take me.
Girl, you a little freaky deaky, ain't you?
Now.
Shoot, you don't have to tell me twice.
Thank you, and have yourself a Dippity Do Dog day.
Oh, my God.
Tour bus.
Code red.
Code red.
Man your stations, man your stations.
Man your stations.

Dip.

Page 38 of the manual, "Don't freak out".
- You're right.
- Yes.
You're right.
I'm okay.
- Okay.
All right.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Here you go, sir.
Come again.
Okay.
- Come again.
Okay, Ali in his heyday versus Mike Tyson.
Girl, you crazy.
Ali all the way.
- No, Tyson all the way.
- Oh!
Are you crazy?
What is wrong with you?
That's it, I'm through with that trainer.
Carlton Banks is fine the way he is.
I told Callahan, in no uncertain terms, he can't push me around anymore.
At first, he wasn't comfortable with it, but I told him, "Tough, get comfortable with it".
I stood up to him like a man.
I told him where to put his gold package.
- What'd he say when you told him?
- He signed me up for the platinum package.
It's twice the price but he promised no rudeness.
Now tell me this.
Tell me this.
Sugar Ray Leonard versus Sugar Ray Robinson.
Sugar Ray Leonard.
He had the speed.
All right, I'll give you that.
Now, this is a tough one right here.
Now, how about Rocky versus Rambo?
In the ring or in the jungle?
Mm.
- The jungle.
- The jungle.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Tssh!
Mirror, mirror on the wall I ain't too short, I ain't too tall Damn, if I don't have it all Come here.
Where are you going?
Oh, I finally got a date with Lori Williams and I am on my way.
How I look, huh?
Uh, uh, boom!
Uh Fine.
Uh Fine?
Well, I don't know.
I think it's that suit.
It's kind of Kind of what?
It just has way too many buttons and the color is very '95.
Girl, you must be crazy.
I look great.
I'm the man when it comes to fashion.
I know when I look good.
Shoot, girl, l  Hey, guys.
I'm gonna go ahead and change.
Come on, everybody, your dad's on TV.
The jury's about to announce the verdict.
Do you think she's innocent or guilty?
Oh, please, that woman turned more tricks than David Copperfield.
She'll probably get off with community service.
Seems to me, community service is what got her in this mess in the first place.
Serving the community.
- Y'all know what I'm talking about, right?
- Hey, hey, hey.
Shh, shh, shh.
Has the jury reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
What is your verdict?
We find the defendant, Tanya Bain, guilty of all 23 counts of pandering.
Order.
Order.
Mm, mm, mm.
Boy, are there gonna be a lot of Ionely guys this Friday night.
Miss Bain will be held at the correctional facility until tomorrow when she will be returned here at 9:30 in the morning for sentencing.
Court is adjourned.
Dad's liable to give her life.
I got grounded for a whole month just because I came home late.
Well, you deserved it.
I mean, getting everybody's hopes up like that and then showing up again.
This fax just came in.
Oh, my God.
What?
What does it say?
It says, "I'm gonna kill you, Banks".
- Yo.
It's a death threat against Uncle Phil.
What?
- What?
Dad?
Oh, thank God.
I thought it was for me.
The fax came right after the verdict was announced.
And they haven't stopped since.
Oh, half of them wanna hang me, half of them wanna hug me.
There's a dude here from Appalachia.
He says he thinks your mouth is kind of pretty.
Guess I'll put this in the hug pile.
Whenever there's a high-profile case like this every wacko comes out of the woodwork.
I say we treat this as a code-one priority.
We need to seal the perimeter.
I want four cars on 24-hour surveillance sharpshooters on the roof, and a canine team.
And remember, we're working with a nut here.
And who are you?
He's the nut we working with.
Heh-heh-heh.
Carlton Banks.
I'll be your point man on this little operation.
I'll tell you what, you let us do our job, and we'll let you do whatever it is you do.
And we'll send a extra car by, Mr. Banks, just to make sure everything's safe.
- Thank you, officer.
- Come on, guys.
That's it?
They're done?
They're leaving?
Well, I, for one, am not gonna stand here and do nothing while your life hangs in the balance.
Son, my life is not hanging in the balance.
Now, wait a minute, Uncle Phil.
I don't usually say this, but I agree with the little squidget.
Come on, you can't go down to that courthouse by yourself.
You need a bodyguard.
Hey, I'm your man.
I'll be fine, Will.
Uh-huh.
That's just what Bobo Anderson said.
- Who?
- Bobo Anderson.
One of my boys from back in Philly.
Bobo started getting all these threatening letters.
Everybody was like:  "You need to watch your back.
Brothers be tripping".
He's like, "No, man, I'm cool.
I'm all right".
Then, bam!
One day he just up and disappeared.
He was killed?
No, his family moved out of town.
I ain't seen him since third grade.
Will, what has all this got to do with your being my bodyguard?
Oh.
I figure if you let me slide down to that courtroom with you, you know I might get to console some of them show-biz madam girls.
You know, it won't be just your body I'm guarding, you know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm talking about, dawg.
You know what I'm saying, right?
You know.
You know what I'm saying.
You know what I'm saying, right?
You know.
You know what I'm saying, boy?
You know Damn, I miss Bobo.
Oh, Carlton, I still think it was a little early to give up on the dating service.
Will, meet Safety Guy.
Safety Guy, what's up, bro?
What's going on, boy?
Look, this happens to be the latest in home and personal security.
"Designed as a visual deterrent, Safety Guy is a life-size simulated male".
Hmm.
And you're a pint-size simulated male.
Very funny.
He's gonna protect the Big Guy when we're not around.
You mean to tell me this thing can protect somebody?
- Oh, absolutely.
- Hmm.
Huh.
He must be on a break, huh?
Will, this is no time for tomfoolery.
Now, take your walkie-talkie and infrared goggles.
Damn.
Oh, my God.
Yo, I can see right through your clothes with these things.
No wonder you're so shy.
Ashley's out in the decoy vehicle and this will be command central.
This baby right here will monitor all our activities.
Your assignment is to be on this - Committed the frequency to memory?
- Check.
- Now, what do you do if we get caught?
- Laugh.
Oh, I see we have company.
Who's your friend?
- Hilary, he's a dummy.
- Heh.
Who needs brains when you got a body like that?
Hey, Uncle Phil, we are here to protect you.
I don't need your protection.
Negatory.
Until we get you to the courthouse we'll be watching your every move and protecting you at all cost.
Trust me, we are a well-oiled machine.
Looks like your well-oiled machine just ran out of gas.
Biggest day of my professional career and now I'm gonna be late.
You should've stayed in the car.
We could've protected you.
The only person who's gonna need protection now is you, if you don't back off!
He's just a little tense about the trial.
Just let him bang down a couple Ding Dongs.
He'll be all right.
Will get a load of the clown in the corner.
We'd better check him out.
Carlton, come on, he's a clown.
He's probably going to some kid's birthday party or something.
We'll see about that.
Okay, pal, state your business.
Who are you?
Never mind who I am.
And wipe that smile off your face and tell me your name.
Juggles.
Well, look, Juggles, get what you're after and get out of here.
Who are you?
Carlton Banks.
And that's my father, Judge Banks.
I'm the head of his security team and my job is to check out suspicious people like you.
So come on, let's go.
Move it along.
Judge Banks from the Show-Biz Madam Trial?
Pretty impressed, huh?
More than you can imagine.
All right!
Nobody moves and nobody gets blown up!
- Excuse - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mr. Juggles?
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not Mr. Juggles, it's Juggles.
All right, Will, I got a plan.
You create a diversion while Dad and I slip out the back.
Hey, yo.
Hey, man, where does that leave me?
You are so selfish.
What do you hope to accomplish by strapping a bomb to your chest and blowing up a gas station?
I'm on my way down to one of the networks and I'm gonna make them put me on TV.
And then the whole world is gonna see my talent to entertain.
Um Wouldn't it be easier to just get a agent?
I had an agent and then he had my wife.
Heh.
That's a joke!
There's gotta be a better way.
Yeah, well, I tried all the other ways, but it's always Bozo this or Coco that.
Never any jobs for Juggles, oh, no.
And I'll tell you another thing I could've sold twice as many hamburgers as that Ronald guy.
That no-act clown.
No.
No.
Nobody wants to give Juggles a chance.
Mm-mm.
One little tent fire.
One little elephant stampede.
A couple of kids end up in the hospital and, all of a sudden, Juggles is poison.
As if they even saw me smoking that cigar.
It's harassment, I tell you!
Well, you're probably in a hurry to get down to that network, you know.
So don't let us stop you.
Grab your little seltzer bottle, hop in your little miniature car.
If you go right now, you could beat rush hour.
No!
No, no, no.
Oh, no.
Now that I got myself a big celebrity judge hostage I'm gonna make the network people come here.
I'll be a bigger celebrity than I even thought.
Now, I've heard enough.
This plan's never gonna work.
Listen, clown, there are not gonna be any news stations down here.
Every station in the world is gonna be at the courthouse waiting for my Dad.
- Carlton - It's gonna be a media circus there.
If you think any news camera people are coming here - Carlton - No, no, no.
He should hear this.
I mean, even the tabloids are gonna be down at the courthouse.
You know, he's right.
This won't work.
Yeah, you guys are going down to the courthouse.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- But I'm coming with you.
- Aah!
Juggles, no!
What are we, Driving Miss Daisy?
Come on, speed it up a little.
I have a date with destiny.
I'm trying to obey the law, unlike someone else in this car.
Pedal to the metal, Tattoo.
And if I don't, I suppose you'll throw me out the window just like you did Safety Guy.
Oh, the sight of that perfectly chiseled foam body being mutilated by that 18-wheeler.
You bastard.
All right, look, you know what?
I have had about enough of this.
Why don't you just give it up, man?
You're going to jail anyway.
Hey, hey, hey.
But who am I to be dissing jail, you know?
I hear there's a lot of fascinating criminals in there.
Look, Jugs Can I call you Jugs?
You are going about this all the wrong way, man.
Dude, let me tell you.
It is gonna be plenty of honeys down at that courthouse.
And you know how the ladies feel about clowns, huh?
Huh?
Ha-ha.
Oh.
You look like you might've had a little freaky rendezvous with the bearded lady or something down there, huh?
Yeah.
So listen, if we go up in there holding hands, man we gonna be sending the wrong message.
So why don't you pop these cuffs off and throw that bomb out the window?
Let's go to that jail and get our party on, you know what I'm saying?
You know, you got a bit of the clown in you.
- Oh, yeah?
- You might even have your own act.
Ha-ha.
But I work alone!
Okay.
This is it.
How do I look?
Oh, my God.
Key?
Key?
Key?
Oh, where is it?
Where's?
Oh, here it is.
Oh, my God.
Look, my hands are shaking.
I'm never gonna be able to do this.
No, no, no.
Hey, no, no.
Relax, man.
Listen, you can do it.
Will, if he doesn't think he can do it, let's not make him.
Oh, he dragged us all the way down here.
He's doing it.
Court is in session.
The Honorable Judge Banks Stop, stop, stop.
Sit, sit, sit.
Sit down.
Come on.
Somebody dim the lights.
It's my damn courtroom, dim the lights.
Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages presenting the hardest-working clown in show business.
I give you Juggles.
Where's the music?
Thank you, Judge Banks.
Ow!
Your Honor, what is going on in here?
This is ridiculous.
That's the general idea.
Ha.
Clean him up.
I'm sorry, bro.
WOMAN : It's not exactly clear what's happening in the courtroom but it appears Judge Banks has lost control.
This is better than Benny Hill.
This wouldn't be the first time that a judge has succumbed to the stress of a trial.
We all remember when Judge Lance Peterson cracked and rendered a verdict with the aide of a sock puppet named Randy.
Uh, uh, uh.
Ooh.
Gee, Juggles, I could really use a hanky.
Well, my able assistant, let me see what I have here.
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha.
Hey, hey.
You never know when it's gonna end.
Oh.
That's the end.
Move on to the next trick.
Oh!
And now for the magic pan trick.
Remove the lid.
Um We should move on to the next trick.
I said, remove the lid.
Ernie!
They're not laughing.
They're all against me.
Hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.
Juggles.
Juggles.
Now listen, these people are not all against you.
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, come here.
Come here.
Listen let me say something to you as a friend.
You suck.
All right?
The reason you can't get work It's not because people don't like you, man you know, it's not because people don't wanna give you a chance.
It's because you suck.
You know?
You're not funny.
You suck.
Will, are you crazy?
Juggles, he doesn't know what he's saying.
You're very funny.
This crowd is just dead.
Carlton, Ernie is dead.
All right, so you didn't like that one.
Well, maybe you'll like the grand finale.
- Juggles.
Wait, wait, Juggles  He's got a bomb!
Ta-da.
Ta-da?
Wait.
You mean, that's your big finale?
Will was right.
You do suck.
Bailiff, get him out of here.
Get him out of here.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I do this thing with dolls.
Sentencing for Tanya Bain, the show-biz madam was postponed until tomorrow after a dangerously insane man in a clown costume held the entire proceedings hostage.
Oh, please.
That ain't even right.
I mean, he ain't insane.
You know, he's just a clown that likes to make people laugh and, I don't know, take some pictures or something Will, that's evidence.
Come on.
Well, who says it can't be fun to play with evidence?
Come on, Uncle Phil, a couple pictures.
Smile.
This is evidence.
We shouldn't be playing with this stuff.
- Hey, look, everyone.
Look who I found.
- Hey.
Hey, it's the dummy.
Oh, yeah, and he found Safety Guy.
Can you believe no one stole him?
Listen, everyone, we were lucky this time but if we've learned anything from this crisis, is that in the face of danger You scream like a girl?
No.
Is that preparation is everything.
Mom, you're the upstairs lookout.
Ashley, man the decoy vehicle.
- Will, secure the perimeter.
- You all want something to eat?
Hilary, upstairs on the roof.
Geoffrey, in the kitchen.
Discipline, people.
Discipline.
Well, buddy, looks like the security of the Banks family rests on our shoulders.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ah, ha, ha!
Uncle Phil's in the house.
Give your little nephew Willie from Philly a little huggy buggy.
Get off me.
Well, well, no more running out of the house in the morning.
No more trial.
No more breakfast for the rest of us.
I'm so glad the trial is over because now we can get to all those things we've been putting off.
- Ah.
Mm.
Ha, ha.
Sounds like somebody got a little booty duty, huh, Uncle Phil?
Sir, there's a Mr. Joe Winters to see you.
Great.
I didn't know he was coming by.
Well, he's the head of the Republicans for a Better Society.
Republicans for a Better Society?
You gotta get me a T-shirt.
What's he here for?
Well, they have this crazy idea that I should become involved in politics.
Oh, politics.
That's such a dirty corrupt business filled with nothing but self-interest.
- Yeah.
Ooh.
I've got goose bumps.
I'm just gonna listen to him.
I don't wanna be rude.
The mark of a true politician.
Tell them what they wanna hear.
Oh, honey, don't forget our lunch reservation.
Oh, well, sweetheart, maybe we should try to make that another time, okay?
Ah.
Suck it up, Mom.
You're in politics now.
- Hi, Mom.
Oh, hey.
Good morning, Ash.
What's good about it?
What's good about it?
Who did they just make assistant head counter girl at Dippity Do Dog, huh?
Oh, please.
I hate my job.
It's dirty.
It's demeaning.
I have to work for a bunch of ingrates.
You'll get used to it.
Thank you and come again.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What kind of mineral water do you have?
Uh, the only water we have is in that fountain over there.
Do I look like I drink out of the public water supply?
Why don't you be a dear and run out and get me some Pellegrino?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I'm a little busy right now.
Do you realize you're talking to Jewel Pemberton?
Ooh.
The same Jewel Pemberton who's gonna order something off the menu or get out of the line?
I didn't build this country's top modeling agency by putting up with such insolence.
Young lady, you will never serve lunch in this town again.
- Is that a promise?
Wait.
Turn your head that way again.
- Excuse me?
- Just turn your head a little to the right.
You are beautiful.
Your hair.
Oh!
Your bone structure.
Your figure.
Has anyone ever talked to you about modeling?
Just this old guy that comes in here with a Polaroid.
How would you like to come work for Pemberton?
Uh What kind of water did you say you wanted?
Ah.
Cauliflower, your favorite.
Geoffrey, what do you know about wine?
I know no one does it better than you, Miss Hilary.
I'm going out with a wine connoisseur tonight and I really want to impress him.
Wear something low-cut.
Well, duh.
Where's Mom?
I can't believe it.
This is the most incredible thing that's ever happened.
I'm so excited.
You know, this is like amazingly, stupendously fantastic.
- You heard?
- Heard about what?
I got discovered today.
I'm gonna be a model.
It's not that old guy with the Polaroid, is it?
What's going on in here?
You'll never guess what happened to me.
Pemberton Modeling Agency wants me to sign with them.
This is the contract.
Sign it.
Please, please, please.
You realize that modeling is a field in which they judge you solely on your looks?
God, you are so lucky.
Ha-ha-ha!
This is a big deal.
I'm gonna have to discuss this with your father.
Mom, it won't interfere with school.
It's an opportunity for me to learn a new career.
One that doesn't make my hair smell like fried meat.
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Pemberton Modeling?
I think they handle Naomi Campbell.
I'd love to handle Naomi Campbell.
Hey, come on, Aunt Viv.
Sign that doggone thing.
Ashley, modeling is a waste of time.
Sure, you'll travel the world, wear beautiful clothes and make millions of dollars but that's it.
Oh, Daddy, Pemberton Modeling Agency wants me to sign with them.
Come on, Uncle Phil.
This is Ashley's big chance for me to meet Naomi Campbell.
- They're talking about putting me in a show.
- A big show.
After which all the models are gonna wanna come home with Ashley and have coffee.
Geoffrey, start making some damn coffee.
Sweetheart, I just don't have time right now.
I've gotta meet with Joe Winters.
Joe Winters?
Now you know how I feel about you going into politics.
Of course I do, sweetheart.
I'm just being polite.
But what about the contract?
Have your mother look at it.
I won't be too late.
Mom?
Fine, honey.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, Ashley, you know the way to get in good with the agency?
You should throw, like, a little, you know, model slumber party.
Thanks, Will.
You know what, forget it.
Forget the slumber party.
Hey.
Just invite them all over and we all just get butt-naked right here.
Look, I did not know they were gonna keep me so late.
But I'm gonna make it up to you.
I bought us tickets for the ballet.
But, Philip, you hate the ballet.
Worse than holding your purse, Vivian.
That's how sorry I am.
No.
No.
No.
Now that is all wrong, Ashley.
Now, look.
You gotta suck those cheeks in.
And then you gotta look like you got a real attitude problem, you know?
- Uh, Will - Oh, that is perfect.
Wait a second, there.
Do you realize they're taking 20-percent commission here?
- What?
- So?
Well, 20 percent is a lot of money.
I'll handle this.
No, I'll handle it.
Nope.
I'll handle it, Tattoo.
- Get out of here.
What, what, what?
- Give me.
Up, Queenie.
Up, Queenie.
Boss, the plane.
The plane.
Will, give me that.
You know, he'll stop that once you get him fixed.
Guys, stop it.
Now, I don't want either of you getting involved.
I'm intelligent and competent and I can handle my own affairs.
Oh, all right.
Well, you're right, Ashley.
You know, this is your deal, you handle it.
I wouldn't dream of interfering.
We'll go take care of this first thing in the morning.
The pond is stocked and I got the worm on my line.
You know what I'm saying?
Whoo!
Come to papa, girl.
Get over here.
I'm going on record as still being against this.
Models are vacant and self-centered and not the type we Banks associate with.
I'll pay you $20 apiece for your phone numbers.
Miss Pemberton will see you now.
Thirty.
And when I call, you don't even have to say anything.
Huh?
Huh?
Fifty.
Look, the show is tomorrow night and we need a makeup man.
I'm sorry, but going to the funeral is not gonna bring your mother back, is it?
Be there.
Ha, ha.
Miss Pemberton.
Don't say another word.
Turn your head to the right.
- Should I cough or something?
Shh!
Strong features.
Oh.
Good frame.
Yes.
Oh.
Yes.
Oh, and I love the ears.
Don't change them.
Handsome, but real.
Like you were West Philadelphia born and raised.
You're hired.
I'm not sure about you.
But you might be right for the husky pre-teen division.
Huh?
That's pretty funny, Jewel.
But, no, we're actually here to discuss Ashley Banks.
Look, we've both been around the block and the bottom line is, this contract is no can do.
Oh, it's a standard contract.
Well, that's very true, but Ashley is not your standard model.
I mean, she has a real shot at being the next Naomi Campbell.
Uh, Naomi wouldn't be around by any chance, would she?
Let's cut to the chase, J.P. Twenty percent is out of the question.
You give our client a contract we can live with or we walk.
Oh, so it's the 20 percent that bothers you.
Well, then how does 10 percent sound?
No, no, no.
How about 5?
You know what, now that I think about it, why should we get anything at all?
Boom-bi-ya.
Sound like we all on the same page here.
Hey, so when she start modeling?
When she finds another agent.
Tell your client she's fired.
We could live with 10.
One, two, three.
Hey, Ashley  Will and Carlton are sorry  Hey, kitty cat, hey, kitty cat Hey, kitty cat Help, help me out  CARLTON : We care about you very much  Plea Plea Plea Please forgive us Will, stop it.
Will!
Please.
I'm going to work now.
Not to the glamorous career I've always dreamed of.
No, thanks to you, I'll be working at Dippity Do Dog until I'm dippity dead.
CARLTON : I think it worked.
I think she's feeling much better.
I think you've been smoking a little bit too much of that cat nip.
Hey, you take that back.
Carlton, it's over.
It's not over.
What does he mean it's over?
It can't be over.
Philip, it's Valentine's Day.
Valentine's Day?
I knew that.
And we'll still be together.
What about the ballet?
I didn't know it was gonna conflict with the Republican fundraiser.
This isn't something that we should miss.
But a night alone with your wife is.
Vivian, you're being unfair.
I didn't know about this until a little while ago.
Unfair?
I'll tell you what's unfair.
For the past few months, we've had no time together.
We finally get some time together and you cancel.
I know.
I know, sweetheart.
- Things are a little hectic right now.
- Things are always hectic, Philip.
But you always seem to find time for your career.
Sir, there's a Mr. Joe Winters on the phone.
He says it urgent.
This is urgent.
I know, sweetheart, and I'll be right back.
Thank you, Geoffrey.
Geoffrey, would lay my clothes out for this evening and get some flowers and candy here ASAP.
That man is on thin ice.
I'll alert the fish.
Regina.
Regina!
Regina, we have a show in four hours and nothing is ready.
Is everyone out to make my life a living hell?
You there, you're fired.
Oh, that helped.
Hey.
How you doing?
We're back.
Ha, ha.
Ah.
It's Management "R" Us.
Whose career are you ruining today?
Ha!
That was funny.
No, but No, actually, we're here to talk to you about Ashley Banks.
We were hoping you would consider re-signing her.
And why would I do that?
I'm telling you, Ashley is on her way to the top.
I mean, she could be the next Naomi Campbell.
Uh, speaking of which, Naomi wouldn't be around, would she?
Look, you've gotta take her back.
She's my sister and she's really, really mad at me.
Okay, look, I'm a reasonable person.
I'll take Ashley back for you, but you have got to do something for me.
I'm gonna fade into the background if you don't get some highlighter on my cheekbones.
Use number seven.
- And, blend, man, blend.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
You guys look great.
Hey.
Oh, so, what do we do?
We just, you know, go out there and walk around?
Just walk around?
Did Voltaire just write?
Did Klimt just paint?
Did Heidegger just think?
I guess we just go out there and walk around.
Ah, Vivian, in the short time I've known your husband, I can say he's a fine man.
You would know.
You've probably spent a lot more time with him than I have lately.
Ah, ha, ha.
Hasn't she got a great sense of humor?
You two make a great couple.
- I'm just glad you're Republicans.
Ha, ha.
Well, Joe, Vivian and I are both thrilled to be here.
Aren't we, sweetie?
Okay, guys.
Your outfits are on the rack right here, okay?
Great.
Where are the dressing rooms?
You're in them.
No, no, Margy.
Wrong outfit.
You're in the purple.
Uh, Will, l I have a little problem with this.
You see, I'm a bit uncomfortable with nudity.
Oh, don't worry, Carlton.
We're all uncomfortable with your nudity.
It's like Colin Powell said: "Family values is the foundation of the American way of life".
Ah.
I couldn't agree with you more, Joe.
The real tragedy in America today is that our youth aren't being given any sense of direction by their parents.
- There's just no communication.
- And what do you think, Vivian?
Oh, I don't have to think.
Philip has decided to do all of the thinking for both of us.
Okay, people.
Showtime.
You guys are gonna do great.
Now, remember.
It's walk, walk, turn, walk.
- Flip, rotate, walk, turn.
- Right.
And remember, no smiling.
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.
Will?
Um, it's flip, turn, walk, rotate?
No, no, no.
It's flip, rotate, turn, walk.
You know, everything that you've been saying resonates with the people in our community.
That's why we're so thrilled that you've decided to run.
What?
Now there's some kids with no family values, huh, Phil?
I couldn't agree with you more.
Oh, my God.
Do you have any idea what you could've cost me this evening, huh?
Did you even consider my feelings before you went prancing out there on that stage?
- Philip.
- Wait, Vivian.
Do you have any sense of the embarrassment I suffered?
- No.
- But we were all wearing the same Nobody embarrassed you, Philip.
And the only one who's not considering other people's feelings in this house is you.
Coming, Geoffrey.
- Stay where you are.
- Leave.
I said, stay.
Leave us alone.
- Go, go, go.
- Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye.
How dare you stick up for those kids after what they put us through.
Speak for yourself, Philip.
The only one who is putting me through anything is you.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means how dare you agree to go into politics without consulting me knowing the way I feel about it.
- I was gonna tell you about it.
When?
When we move into the Governor's Mansion?
Oh, now we're getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?
But Philip, this is not a joke.
I want my husband back.
For the past few months, you have been promising this entire family more time, more attention, more you.
Vivian, this is a great opportunity.
- For whom?
- For all of us.
Nope.
Wrong.
For you.
Vivian, you've lost perspective.
Now, if you think about this, you'll see how great it is.
The only thing I see is that somewhere along the way, us became you.
And frankly, I'm not gonna take it anymore.
And what is that supposed to mean?
It means I'm going to my sister's house until you figure out what's important to you.
- What?
- Goodbye.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: I'm so glad the trial is over because now we can get to all those things we've been putting off.
Sounds like somebody got a little booty duty, huh, Uncle Phil?
Daddy, Pemberton Modeling Agency wants me to sign with them.
Come on, Uncle Phil, this is Ashley's big chance for me to meet Naomi Campbell.
- They're talking about putting me in a show.
- A big show.
After which, all the models are gonna wanna come home with Ashley and have coffee.
Geoffrey, start making some damn coffee.
Sweetheart, I don't have time right now.
I've gotta meet with Joe Winters.
Joe Winters?
Honey, you know how I feel about you going into politics.
Of course I do, sweetheart.
I'm just being polite.
That man is on thin ice.
I'll alert the fish.
You know, Phil, everything that you've been saying resonates with the people in our community.
That's why we're so thrilled that you've decided to run.
What?
I want my husband back.
Vivian, this is a great opportunity.
- For whom?
- For all of us.
The only thing I see is that somewhere along the way "us" became you.
And frankly, I'm not gonna take it anymore.
And what is that supposed to mean?
Goodbye.
I am having a terrible day.
John Felipe canceled my hair appointment.
Kim Cho chipped one of my nails Moishe ran out of potato latkes and I can see Jose didn't cut the grass.
Hilary, your parents just broke up.
Oh, great.
On top of it all, now I'm an orphan?
Hilary, you're 27.
I know.
No one adopts anyone over 9.
Good morning.
Way to put on the game face, Big Guy.
Hey, Uncle Phil I just want you to know that it's okay for a man to cry.
Look, kids, there's nothing to be concerned about.
Your mother and I just had a silly little misunderstanding.
She'll be back before lunch.
It's no big deal.
Well, I'd like to go on record here and now that I, for one, am not concerned.
I'm on your team, Governor Banks.
Mm.
Mm-mm-mm.
Dinner smells delicious.
What do you have in that pot?
Boiling water, sir.
No one boils water like you, Geoffrey.
- Anyone check the mail?
- It's on the counter, sir.
Ah, this modern communications you mail something off yesterday and it's here today.
Boy, there are all kinds of ways to keep in touch.
Any messages for me?
No messages.
Why should there be?
There's always someone here to answer the phone.
Any calls for me?
Well, there was one.
Yes, I knew it.
So who was it?
Your skirt steaks are down at the depot.
They'll be here by morning.
Hey, Uncle Phil, so how's the single life?
Ha, ha, ha.
- That's not funny.
- You are so right.
- Has your Aunt Viv called?
- Yeah, she called a little while ago.
And what does she have to say about me, huh?
Nothing.
"Nothing," nothing?
She didn't even mention my name?
- Oh, well, yeah, she mentioned your name.
- Well, what'd she say?
- Oh, yeah, it was completely out of context.
- Well, tell me.
Tell me.
Well, she said, "Did you talk to your mom back in Phil-adelphia"?
Hey, come on, Uncle Phil.
I'm sure Aunt Viv is gonna be back real soon.
Dad, what if she's not home soon?
Don't you think maybe she's waiting for you to go get her?
Losing proposition.
Can only weaken your position.
Besides, they're in her camp.
If you want my advice, nothing says "I want you back" like jewelry.
You know, there's something to that.
Unless, of course, they're setting us up.
Well, she was upset, maybe a gift isn't a bad idea.
You know, I been a little unhappy with you too, Uncle Phil.
Yeah, you know, I been thinking about leaving.
Leave.
Glad you keep that sense of humor, Uncle Phil.
Heh.
Vivian, girl, you watching a talk show?
Please, the Bulls are playing.
The Bulls?
Since when are you a sports enthusiast?
Child, please.
Since Michael Jordan went back to the NBA and started wearing them shorts again.
Ah!
Look at those buns.
Booyah!
Whoo!
- Go away.
Open the door, Helen.
It's Philip.
I'd give him a blast of pepper spray but I'm afraid he'd just eat it.
Let him in.
Coming.
- Daddy.
Ha, ha, ha.
How you doing, buddy?
You having a good time here at your Aunt Helen's?
Yeah.
She's teaching me all kinds of cool stuff, fat-head.
Ha, ha, ha.
Honey.
Honey, please.
You mustn't repeat things Aunt Helen tell you.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come on.
Let's go upstairs and watch the game.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
I was just driving around the neighborhood.
I heard they were They had this This thing down at that place I hadn't I miss you, Vivian.
I'm sorry for not including you in my decision to enter politics.
I was wrong.
Can we just put this behind us?
And I bought you a little something.
Oh, Tiffany's.
Get it appraised!
This is beautiful, Philip.
Thank you.
Now, can we just go home?
I can't tell you how happy I am you're giving up politics.
I never said I was giving up politics.
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.
I said I was sorry for not including you in my decision to enter politics.
I never said anything about not entering.
You came all the way down here and nothing has changed?
Vivian, I know that you don't love politics, but - This is not about politics.
It's about us.
- What are you talking about?
I want what I thought we've wanted all the time and now all of a sudden, you want something completely different.
Vivian, I came all the way down here, I said I was sorry, I said I was wrong.
- Now, what more do you want from me?
- Right now, I want you to leave.
If I leave I'm not coming back, Vivian.
Good.
Because when I walk out that door, I'm gone.
I'm moving closer to the door, Vivian.
This is your last chance.
I mean it.
Oh, for God's sake, would you leave already!
I think it's so romantic, Dad going to get Mom.
It's like in that movie where after a big fight, the wife stays with her sister and the next day the husband buys her something expensive and she returns home.
Hil, that's not a movie, that's what happened.
Oh, well, someone should make a movie of it.
Oh, where's Mom?
- Is she outside?
- No.
- What, she's in the car?
- I'm gonna go get her bags.
- She's not out there.
Good Lord, what did you do to her?
Don't worry, Big Guy, I got you covered.
He was with me the whole time.
She's at your Aunt Helen's.
Well, what happened?
Nothing.
And nothing's gonna happen.
This sounds a little serious.
Can you imagine if they never got back together?
Has anybody seen my hat?
Where the hell is my hat?
Dad?
You're not hiding my hat so I have to stay home again, are you?
Oh, do you really have to go to work?
I'm Ionely.
Yes, Dad.
And what are you doing out of your room?
I wanna hear another story.
Okay.
You wanna hear another story.
Once upon a time a little girl could've been a supermodel but her parents got divorced and she lost it all.
The end.
Wanna hear another?
No.
No.
Save something for tonight.
Can't you stay a few more minutes?
I could if the car wasn't repossessed and if I didn't have to walk to work.
Exercise would do you good.
Was that a fat joke?
- Would you care for something to drink?
- Yes, please.
You rang, Master Geoffrey?
What took you so long?
Two more, please, Philip.
- Fluff those cushions.
- Yes.
Yes.
Dust the bookshelf.
Clean the bathroom upstairs.
Shine the mirror.
Straighten the pictures.
Tidy the plants.
Get me a rose.
For the love of God, man, shred, shred, shred.
If I could just figure out who's been leaking all this to the press.
It must be an inside job.
Geoffrey, keep shredding.
Yes, sir.
Carlton.
Oh, don't worry, Big Guy, I'm taking care of our little problem.
Our little problem?
Heh, heh, heh.
Son, what were you thinking?
What was I thinking?
I told you everything I was doing.
You were involved every step of the way.
I have no recollection of the event in question.
No recollection?
It was all for you.
Ever since Mom left, it's all been for you.
I have no recollection of the event in question.
I just wanted to stop by and tell you that even though your parents are divorced you're still the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Thank you very much.
Now, be gone.
So, what'd you wanna ask me?
Katie, look, you know, we've been dating each other for a long time now and I just wanna tell you that I've never loved anybody the way that I love you.
Katie will you marry?
- Hey, what up, dawg?
What it be like?
I've been out traveling the world and Whoa.
Who is this lovely young lady?
- Oh, Uncle Phil, this is Katie.
- Ah.
Katie, Katie, Katie.
Sexy lady.
Will's told me an awful lot about you but what he failed to tell me was you were so good-Iooking.
Heh, heh.
Yeah, well, the young brother gets convenient amnesia every once in a while.
You know what I'm saying.
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey, Uncle Phil, can I rap to you for a sec?
- Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Sure.
- Excuse us, Katie.
You stay there, baby.
Um, Uncle Phil, I'm in the middle of something important right now.
Oh!
My bad.
Hey, you know.
Because Well, you know.
Let me just go on upstairs here and take a shower because I'm feeling kind of dirty.
- How about I shower with you?
- Ooh.
Hey, hey, hey, Uncle Phil.
Hey, hey, hey, don't be a player hater, my brother.
Every time.
Every damn time.
Every time!
- Will.
- Every time I turn around it's the same thing!
- Will.
- Over and over!
Uh We need to get them two back together.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
- Are you sure about this place, Will?
- Sure?
Come on, it's great food and grass skirts and great live entertainment.
Tall and tan and young and lovely - A girl from lpanema goes walking - He's butchering it.
And when she passes Each one she passes goes, "Ah" When she walks, she's like a samba She swings so cool and sways so gentle That when she passes Each one she passes goes, "Ooh"  Now, that's how it's supposed to be done.
- I'm out of here.
- Wait, wait.
Wait a minute, Uncle Phil.
Now, I didn't wanna have to make the hard sell, but Excuse me.
- they got three pages worth of pork dishes up in here.
Well, since we're already here Heh, heh, heh.
I'll tell you, Viv.
I come here all the time.
They got food, entertainment and men in grass skirts.
Look at that.
Ha, ha!
Come here, boy.
Come back here.
Ha, ha.
They wouldn't let me bring my leaf blower.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Look who is here.
Oh, hey, what a small world.
It just got smaller.
Boy, are we gonna have a good time.
Whoo-whoo!
I can feel the love in this room.
Yeah.
You know, I don't know if it's possible or even safe to have any more fun than we're having right now, but let's give it a shot.
- Uncle Phil, how about some karaoke?
- No.
Okay, fine.
That's just like you.
If it's not your idea, you don't wanna do it.
- What?
- Okay, you know what?
That's it.
We are getting up from this table.
- You two are gonna sit here and talk.
Where are you?
And I'm taking the keys.
I got the keys.
See?
See?
Hey?
I don't hear nothing.
ALL : Stop in the name of love Before you break my heart Think it over Well, I guess I could take a cab.
That's right, run right back to campaign central.
Give it a rest, Vivian.
- What's the matter, can't take the truth?
- The truth is you overreacted.
I did not overreact.
You lied.
CARLTON : Reunited  And it feels so good Go on, kiss her, Phil, baby Reunited and it's understood Vivian, I told you I was sorry.
I don't know how many ways to say it.
I was wrong.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about the 28 years of dreaming and waiting for when we'd be in a position to have some time to ourselves.
Now I find out it's all a lie.
Vivian, I didn't lie.
Philip, you must make a pact CARLTON &  Ooh  You gonna bring my Aunt Viv back - Ooh  Where there is love, you'll be there  Just look over your shoulders, Philip Philip, I stood behind you.
I supported you.
I rooted for you every step of the way.
But the long nights and the dinners alone and the postponed vacations were not supposed to last forever.
They won't.
Just because I'm running for political office doesn't mean I'm gonna win.
Philip, you win at everything.
Ha, ha.
Touché, you got me there.
Ha, ha, ha.
Philip, you always said that spending time with me and the family was the most important thing to you.
It is.
Why can't we have it all?
Can we?
Can you honestly sit there and tell me I can have my husband back, the kids can have their father back and you can serve in office all at the same time?
Can you say that to me?
I want to but I can't.
Look, Vivian, I didn't lie.
I want the same things that you want and maybe I did overlook a few things before I decided to run for office.
I love you.
What am I gonna do with all those campaign buttons?
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Good.
- Wait.
Hold up, hold up.
Where y'all going?
Wait a minute.
Come on, we got one more number.
Yeah, come on, y'all, this is our big finish.
Day-o - Day-o Ay-yay-yay-yay!
Oh!
- It's day-o - It's day-o Daylight come and me wanna go home Bree-ba-ba!
Bree-ba-ba!
Day-o  Day-o   It's day-o - It's day-o  Rasta!
Ba!
Daylight come and me wanna go home
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Better watch yourself, boy.
Here I come.
Penny, down low to Shaq.
Shaq, back out to Penny for three.
Boom, in Clyde's face.
Ten bucks.
Now give me my money, Pee Wee.
Double or nothing.
- This time, you're going down.
- I can't believe you two, wasting your time.
Aren't you both a little old to be playing video games?
This isn't just a video game, Dad.
This is the new 32-bit super system with digitized sound, VGA graphics and full-motion video.
Yo, and it's real cool too.
Those games are just a waste of time.
This has just arrived for you, Master Carlton.
It's from Princeton.
Princeton?
Open it up.
I can't.
What if it's a rejection?
You've been rejected your whole life.
You should be used to it by now.
Come on.
Well, here goes nothing.
I'm in!
I'm going to Princeton!
Yes, yes, yes.
It finally happened.
Somebody, pinch me.
Ow!
Congratulations, son.
This is wonderful.
You've been waiting for this for so long.
- Hey, let's go out and celebrate, huh?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Oh, I gotta get my jacket.
- I'll be right along with you.
Okay.
Yeah.
- All right.
All right.
Pa-yow!
Passes down the court.
There he goes.
Blinding speed.
Goes up for the lay Ha, ha.
Well, you see, you two left the TV on, and And, well, I, you know  You want a piece of me?
Hey, G, come on, man.
Can I get some spare change?
No.
Use your own money.
G, come on.
It's dime-a-frame bowling day.
It's always more fun when you use other people's dimes.
For the last time, Master William, I have no spare change.
What about that piggy bank in your closet under them issues of Big Butted Butler Babes?
That was just a lucky guess, man.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Man, what's up?
Hey, look, look, you got some spare change for a brother, Uncle Phil?
Carlton's going to Princeton and you're panhandling.
It's nice to see that everybody's reaching their potential.
It's dime-a-frame bowling day.
You got some spare change?
Doesn't Carlton's recent success light the fire of ambition in you?
No.
You gotta have something in this pocket.
- Get off me.
- Don't make me go in there.
- Here.
Take this.
Get out of my face.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, Hil, why so blue?
Ha, ha.
I volunteered to spend the weekend with a flock of Blue Birds.
Well, just keep them away from my car.
I just got it waxed.
They're not real birds.
They're like Girl Scouts.
And I am the honorary Hen Mother.
Hilary, that's wonderful.
What do you have planned?
Planned?
I don't know.
I thought I'd just watch them run around.
I think groups like this usually like to do outdoorsy things.
You know, like camping, hiking, horseback riding.
They do?
Oh PHIL & CARLTON : Crash through the line of blue And send the backs on 'round the end Fight, fight For every yard.
Princeton's honor to defend.
Rah-rah-rah!
Throw you hands up If you wanna be down So come on Rah-rah-rah Oh, look, here's my old Princeton beanie.
It fits perfectly.
Oh, God, it's been a long hard struggle, son, but you made it.
It sure has.
But I know it's not gonna be easy.
Oh, you're damn right.
You're gonna finally find out the meaning of competition.
Because at Princeton, they separate the wheat from the chaff.
But you're ready.
You're gonna be a part of the crème de la crème.
So I guess that makes Pokey here the crème of wheat.
This is gonna be a big change for you.
From now on, it's just gonna be work, work, work.
Boy, boy, boy.
This crate sure brings back a lot of memories.
Oh, look, my old trophy.
The yearbook.
Heh, heh.
What's this?
A Twinkie.
I just dug this out of the attic because I thought maybe you'd wanna go through it.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Rah-rah-rah!
Man.
Oh.
A Afro pick.
I wonder who this belonged to.
Hey, look, it's Dad's Phi Beta Kappa key.
Man, look, defensive player of the year.
Wow, look at all this stuff.
Valedictorian, voted most popular, captain of the debating team.
Yo, Uncle Phil was just straight up the man around that joint.
Oh, my God.
He's shaking hands with President Johnson.
Will, I don't know if I can do this.
I don't think you wanna be shaking hands with President Johnson right now.
That's not what I mean.
I mean, I knew Dad was, you know a big deal and everything but my God, how do you follow this?
Carlton, what are you talking about?
Well, as hard as I work and as well as I do the best that I'll ever be is not quite as good as Dad.
I don't know if I can do this.
I don't know if I could ever fill Dad's shoes.
I don't know if I could ever be good enough.
Hey, hey, come on.
Carlton, man.
I mean, I know this might be a bad time, but you got some spare change?
Hey, look, Carlton, we're in a public place, man.
Now don't embarrass me.
Get out of here before I hurt you, girl.
- Hey.
- Can I help you?
Yeah.
We'll take a size 12 and a three and a half.
- Six and a half.
- Oh.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
These look like they've been worn before.
Carlton, take the shoes and come on.
Fine.
Oh, C, man, you came up with the quickness.
I did, didn't I?
I mean, for the first time out, I wasn't bad.
Dude, you rolled a 130.
That's good.
You know what that means?
- That I'm a natural?
- No.
You gotta buy lunch.
Huh?
Here is the church.
Here is the steeple.
Open the door and Where are all the people?
This is so boring.
Yeah.
Well, what do you want me to do?
GIRLS : Nature walk, nature walk, nature walk.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's all the noise, Big Birds?
It's not Big Birds, Big Ears.
It's Blue Birds.
Big Ears.
That's funny.
I'm gonna remember that when cookie time roll around.
Hey, Hil, could you do me a favor and get your flock out of here.
Very funny.
But we're leaving.
We're going on a nature walk.
Geoffrey, can you give us a ride to nature?
Hey, Uncle Phil, who is this rough-Iooking brother standing next to you?
Heh, heh.
That's your Aunt Viv.
Yeah, uh, her facial hair was different back then.
Why didn't anyone remind me that I hate children?
My God, Hilary, what happened to you?
I went on a nature walk with those little blue people.
It was awful.
We were startled by a deer, swarmed by butterflies.
And I have such a headache from that babbling brook.
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
The Princeton man.
Ha-ha-ha.
Son, I just signed a check for your first year's tuition.
Thought I'd give you the honor of mailing it.
Oh, I won't be needing it.
Oh, my God.
You got a scholarship.
I didn't even know you had applied.
This is wonderful news.
It's not that, but I do have wonderful news.
What, the adapter for your inflatable doll came in?
- So, what's the wonderful news?
- Dad, I've decided not to attend Princeton.
Oh, after all you've been through, you've decided to stay at ULA, huh?
- No.
- Okay.
You're not going to ULA.
You're not going to Princeton.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm gonna be a bowler.
Oh, so you're going to bowl?
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, that's very different.
You certainly don't need Princeton for that.
There you go.
I knew you'd be supportive.
Supportive.
Just what?
Are you out of your mind?
- Are you out of your mind?
- Will, I'll handle this.
Are you out of your mind?
Just because I'm not gonna do what you want me to do, you're angry?
For the first time in my life, I'm standing on my own two feet filling my own two shoes.
And not just being what you want me to be.
What are you talking about?
I have never stopped you from being what you wanna be.
- That ain't exactly true, Uncle Phil - Shut up, Will.
This is my decision.
I finally found something I'm good at that I like, and that's it.
- You're gonna bowl?
- I'm gonna bowl.
- Fine.
- Fine?
Fine.
Your son is about to throw his life away and all you can say is "fine"?
If I stop him from bowling, I will be doing exactly what he's accusing me of.
He just needs a little space.
He will get over this.
Uncle Phil, I think we need to nip this thing in the bud.
Oh, it's just a phase, Will.
Just a phase.
Just a phase?
We worked our fingers to the bone to put him through school.
He's about to throw it away and I'm the only one who wants to do anything?
It is a sad, sad day when Will Smith becomes the voice of reason.
I said stop it!
Stop that!
Oh, Geoffrey, who am I kidding?
I can't do any of this.
I've even heard rumblings that I'm not any fun.
Nonsense, Miss Hilary.
Now, Master Carlton, he's no fun.
But you're a splendid young lady with a lot to offer.
If you just pick something you like and are good at those girls will have a wonderful time with you.
- Geoffrey, do you really mean that?
- No.
It just seemed the right thing to say.
We gotta talk, boy.
- Will you excuse us for a second, please?
- See you later, Pins.
Pins?
What is that short for, pinhead?
No, it is not.
What happened to the guy whose biggest dream was to go to Princeton?
Look, I used to have a lot of dreams, Will.
I used to dream that I was being chased by hot dogs and doughnuts.
But it's just a dream.
It means nothing.
This is reality.
Carlton, this isn't reality.
This is stupid.
Will, my dad supports me.
Why can't you?
Your dad isn't thinking straight.
The man's hopped up on a 25-year-old Twinkie.
Will, you're just wasting your time.
You don't wanna bowl.
You wanna go to Princeton.
No.
My dad wants me to go to Princeton, I wanna bowl.
You wanna go to Princeton, but you're just afraid.
Oh, I see what this is.
Will, you're suffering from Pins envy.
Carlton, me envious of you?
Oh, I see it, Will.
I mean, why shouldn't you be?
I'm going to be a professional athlete.
Professional?
Carlton, you can't even beat me.
Ha!
Okay.
Let's have a match.
Just you and me.
Oh, okay.
You win, do what you wanna do.
I win, you gonna take your butt to Princeton.
Now, that's stupid.
What?
You a little chicken there, bro?
Oh, go ahead.
Teach him a lesson, Pins.
And by the way, I have a coffee break in 15 minutes.
Okay.
You're on.
Phew.
Well, well, well.
I'm surprised you showed.
Why don't you just save yourself the embarrassment?
Go home, start getting packed for Princeton.
Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't I not and say I did?
Well, it looks like we don't need to do no more talking.
Let's just grab our balls.
Whoa.
Looks like I just need three pins to win and there's four standing up there.
I've got three-out-of-four chance.
Bye-bye.
Crash through the line of blue And send the backs on 'round the end  I love it.
Wait a All right.
Wait a minute.
My shoe.
My shoe My shoe stuck.
But That's a do-over.
That's not No, hold up.
No, that's a do-over.
That's No.
Somebody paged me right when I went Right when I was Right when I was doing this, somebody paged me.
Hilary, how's it going with your little Blue Birds?
Terrific.
We finally found something that we can really connect on.
Where are they?
Come on, girls.
Hurry it up.
Last one in the sauna is gonna get clogged pores.
Hey, Uncle Phil.
That Carlton's gonna be some bowler, huh?
Oh, Will.
Carlton's not gonna be a bowler.
It's just a phase.
He is not gonna throw his life away bowling.
Heh, heh.
- He's not?
- Like I said the best thing we can do is just to steer clear of him.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
Well, see I kind of took a different approach.
I kind of, like, steered right at him, you know what I'm saying?
I think I may have strengthened his resolve to throw his whole life away.
But I just wanna say to you, I don't think that should affect our relationship.
What are you talking about?
Oh, so you need further elaboration.
Well, see, Uncle Phil, now, you know I know I can beat Carlton at any sport, right?
But then I had found out bowling ain't no sport.
Shh.
You know, so Carlton's not going to Princeton.
He's going to join the PBA.
I'm gonna go get a grub, want me to make you something?
Will, I find out that you contributed to my son not going to Princeton you will be picking my shoe leather out of - Hi, y'all.
- Hey.
Look, it's Pins.
Son, I think it's about time we had a little talk.
Oh, I think we should.
You're darn skippy, we should.
You're darn skippy y'all should.
Carlton, you're right.
It's always been my dream for you to go to Princeton.
But it's been yours also.
I never pushed you.
I know.
I just freaked out.
When I got accepted and you brought down that box of achievements I just realized that I could never measure up to you.
I got scared.
Son, this is not a competition.
And it's perfectly natural for you to feel the pressure and get mixed up and start bowling.
But bowling never solves anything, it just makes things worse.
Oh, I know that now.
Oh, sure, it offered a quick high, cheap thrills and fast women, but who wants that?
I'm a Princeton man.
Son, I have always been proud of your achievements.
The only question in my mind is if Princeton is good enough for you.
Yeah?
Do you think I should hold out for Harvard?
No.
Listen.
There are always gonna be things that I'm better at than you and you'll be better at than I am.
Oh, you mean like bowling.
Well, I'm sure there are a lot of things, but bowling?
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Not bowling.
Dad, I can beat you at bowling.
You want a piece of me?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
See, now this is called the-severed-finger-in-a-box trick.
See, you just slide your finger up in the bottom and then voilà.
Cool.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Hey, what's up, C?
Watch and learn.
Hey, Carlton, what's up, man?
You know, I was out so I picked a little something up for you.
Will, how sweet.
Ha, ha, ha.
Ow!
Let's get Geoffrey.
I don't know.
I'll give it a try but I've been trying to get G for years, he don't fall for nothing.
Hey, G. You know, man, I was out and I was thinking about you, you know so I picked a little something up for you.
I'm looking for Geoffrey.
- I'm Geoffrey.
- Then you must be my father.
Well, he fell for that.
Let's have it, what's your name, boy?
Where are you from?
And where'd you get that outstanding cashmere jacket?
I know this is quite a shock.
I'm sorry for startling you, Father.
Let's put a pin in this father thing for the time being.
I'm sure you're a nice enough lad, but I have no son.
So let's see, the YMCA is downtown.
Open for business.
There's a church next door.
If you sit through a sermon you can eat for free.
Bye-bye.
Ta-ta.
Cheerio.
Wait, I can prove it.
You're allergic to peanuts.
Many are.
Your middle name is Barbara.
Lucky guess.
Barbara?
It's a family name.
Okay.
You have a tattoo of the Queen Mum on your Oh, my God.
How can Geoffrey be your dad if he was never married?
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Well, you see, Nicky, sometimes the stork's arms get real tired, right?
He pretty much leave the baby wherever he at.
- Will.
All right.
Get.
Thank you.
Well, Nicky, sometimes the stork's map gets all scrunched up.
Sorry, I should explain.
My name is Frederick Vickers.
Penelope's your mother?
- So it's true?
- Well, we were married.
Briefly.
But we had no children.
That's right, G. Stick to your story, man.
At least till the blood test come out, man.
- Don't tell him nothing.
- Will.
Will.
By the time Mom knew she was pregnant, you'd already left for America.
But everything turned out fine.
We live in a small flat in Kensington.
I enjoy riding, cricket and books about the sea.
Yo, he got the same interests as Miss July.
Well, it was nice meeting you, but I should be going.
- I need to check into a motel for the night.
- Motel?
Nonsense.
I insist you stay here.
My house is your house.
That is, my room and half a shelf in the refrigerator.
Yeah, at least stay for dinner.
Of course he can stay, Geoffrey.
In the pool house with us.
It'll be fun.
We'll stay up late, play Clue and try on each other's jackets.
Heh, heh, heh.
I think it sounds like a ripping good time.
Say, do you have any Tom Jones records?
Do I?
Hilary, if I didn't know any better I'd say you were reading.
I am.
This is fascinating.
- What's it about?
- Me.
Frederick's arrival's made me wanna look into my own past, you know?
Look at all of this.
It's all me.
I have enough stuff here to write a book.
- Kind of a riches-to-riches story, huh?
- Ha, ha, ha.
Ugh Oh, look at this picture from my kindergarten class.
Oh, I was darling, wasn't I?
Aw, you sure were.
Heh, heh, heh.
Who is this poor little homely child next to me?
Uh, sweetheart, that was you.
What?
You always said The first time you looked at these, you cried so hard that we lied to you.
We said you were the cute little girl next to you.
But eventually, your teeth straightened out and you grew into your nose, just like we said.
You mean, you lied to me?
You told me I was pretty when I wasn't?
- Well - Thank you.
You really do love me.
- Geoffrey, are you all right?
- Never better, sir.
- What is all this stuff?
- Oh, they're for Frederick.
Transformers.
They're on special.
A mitt.
A football.
A tool set.
And, just in case, a book on interior design.
Geoffrey, I hate to break this to you, but you're about 10 years too late.
Boys Frederick's age don't play with toys.
Ooh!
Transformers.
I've been looking for Razorbeast since, like, October.
I must admit, sir, I'm at a loss.
You've raised four children.
Well, five if you include  Bow before Razorbeast or I will crush you.
I just don't know what to do first.
Geoffrey, I have known you for years.
You will be a great father.
But, sir, I don't know anything about him.
I don't know what his interests are.
I don't even know whether he would prefer a loose or a firm pleat.
Geoffrey, you will have plenty of time to find everything out.
Had I known I was a father, I would've known all this.
- I would have been there.
- I know you would have.
I'm so nervous.
I just don't want to let him down.
Geoffrey, you will do fine.
Just be yourself.
Does that mean I don't have to play catch?
- That's right.
- Oh, good.
Then he doesn't have to know his dad throws like a girl.
Since Frederick is a guest of honor tonight I insist that you join us for dinner.
- Oh, very kind of you, sir.
Yeah, yeah.
Sit on down.
Sit on down.
Okay.
Perhaps I should join you after dinner.
Great.
That way we can eat.
That would be better.
There you go.
Ha, ha, ha.
Have you noticed how Father holds that dish perfectly balanced in his right hand with his fingers just barely steadying it?
Superb, Father.
England must be really boring.
I think it's so great you're not embarrassed that your father has to do this stuff in people's lives that's too disgusting for them to do themselves.
No offense, Geoffrey.
None taken, Miss Hilary.
I always consider the source.
How sweet.
Heh.
You know, Father, being in service is something I've always dreamed of.
- May I?
- Certainly, son.
"Son".
I do like the sound of that.
I know I can't match your expertise.
I owe it all to my training at the Cambridge Academy of Butlering.
Ah, to be a CAB grad and wear the school colors, black and white.
Perhaps one day we can work together.
No.
CAB is very expensive.
No, it's a dream that shall never be.
I wanna be a butler too.
No, you don't.
Thanks for taking me with you.
You had gorgeous women literally climbing all over you today.
You're even better than Will.
How'd you do it?
Well, I'm sure the ladies were merely charmed by my accent.
Man, you gotta teach me how to talk that English stuff.
No problem, Jazz.
I hope I didn't cramp your style today, Will.
Who me?
Man, I got plenty of honeys to choose from.
Shoot.
You know, in England we call pool "snooker".
Snooker.
Ha, ha, ha.
Man, the way this guy talk cracks me up.
What y'all people call this?
A clock.
"A clock".
Heh, heh, heh.
I gotta remember that.
Hey, yo, pizza.
Sixteen bucks without tip.
All right.
- Ah, man, I don't have no money.
- Ditto.
Unfortunately, I'm down to my last penny.
All right.
Excuse me one second, bro.
I gotta go check my super secret stash.
- All right, come on.
Assume the position.
- Oh, come on, Will.
You know the routine.
- You ain't special.
Fall in line, Brit boy.
- Oh, sorry.
Gotta go find my money All right, y'all can look now.
There you go,  Mm-mm-mm.
Two jumbos with extra jalapeños and pineapples.
- Come on.
We got to rock this by the pool.
Cool.
I mean, that sounds like ripping fun.
Ha, ha, ha.
I shall join you fellows out there shortly.
I have to avail myself of the bathroom.
"The bathroom".
Damn, I gotta learn how to speak that language.
We'll be out by the pool, man.
Yo, Freddy Boom-Boom, man, we about Oh, hello, I was just looking for your bathroom.
- What you got there, man?
- Pardon me?
Give me my money, man.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Hey, you took my money out from under that plant.
Give it here.
I have no idea what you're referring to.
Let me see if we can jog your memory up in here.
Fine.
What were you going to do?
Beat me up?
Oh, no.
I'm about to beat you down.
Let's go, boy.
Come on.
Come on.
Ah!
Ugh!
Boy, let me tell you.
You are so lucky that you Geoffrey's son.
Ah.
I'm glad it finally comes in handy for something.
- Don't be talking about your pop like that.
- My father of two days?
- Your servant?
- I thought you wanted to be just like him.
Oh, please.
Me be a butler, serving the likes of you?
Now you made it personal.
Go ahead, hit me.
No.
That's too easy.
I'm gonna tell your father what kind of son he has.
Go ahead, break his heart.
- Y'all seen Frederick?
- Yeah.
In the kitchen with Geoffrey.
Hil, I need to talk to you for a second.
Now, look, what if you knew something that you really needed to tell somebody but you knew if you told them it would hurt them?
Maybe even break their heart.
Oh, no.
I haven't grown into my nose.
Teaspoon.
Soupspoon.
Salad fork.
Dinner fork.
Frederick, my man.
Pip-pip.
You look like an ass.
I'll have you know this is a bona fide British bowler and bumbershoot.
I don't know which is which, but I paid good money for the set.
I cannot believe you sweating this fool.
I saw him stealing money out from under my secret plant.
Will, just for my edification, what plant would that be now?
Carlton, did you hear what I said?
You just can't get over the fact that there's a couple new guns in town.
I say, old bloke, what do you say we squire ourselves down to the local pub and chat up some birds?
- What?
Wanna get a drink after dinner?
By Jove, that was a jolly good meal.
- You see this fork?
Yeah.
If you don't stop talking like that it's gonna be in your leg.
Frederick, finding out that you are my son has been one of the greatest joys of my life.
And knowing that you wish to follow in my footsteps has made me a very happy man.
- So if you wish to go to the Academy - Oh, Father, more than anything.
Perhaps this check for your tuition will show you how I feel.
Oh.
Oh!
Whoa!
You're going to make a blooming good butler.
Ow!
Pip-pip.
Cheerio.
Carlton, where is he?
Where is he?
Oh, who scraped the icing off your cupcake?
Carlton, I've been going over this in my mind.
G has got to know about his son.
Where is that little thief?
Oh, Will, will you stop with these crazy allegations?
First he tried to rob me.
Now he's trying to stick it to G. - Where is he?
- Will, the money is for his education.
He don't wanna go to no butler school.
I'm not asking again, where is he?
Will, cool your jets, mister.
You're all over the map.
Carlton, where is he?
Where is he?
I think he went to go get his suitcase repaired.
- What are you talking about?
- He's gone and so is his suitcase.
That's the only logical explanation.
Carlton, man, he left.
Come on, we gotta stop him.
Fine, but you're only gonna be making a fool of yourself.
Frederick is trustworthy.
Hey, my bowler's gone.
That limey thief.
- His flight leaves in about five minutes.
- Right behind you.
- Hold on there, sport.
- Carlton, I gotta go to the gate, man.
Go back through.
- Empty your pockets.
- I don't have anything in my pockets.
I think you're gonna have to come with me.
Hey!
Last call for boarding Air Britain Flight 1420 to London.
What's up, man?
What, no goodbye?
No, "Let's keep in touch"?
I thought you were such a gentleman.
Give me that check right now.
It's not yours.
This has nothing to do with you, Will.
This is between me and my father.
What, were you just sitting around one day sipping tea and crumpets and just decided: "Hey, I'm gonna fly halfway around the Earth to go steal from the father that I don't even know"?
I don't call it stealing.
I call it getting what's owed to me.
Now, if you'll excuse me, my plane is boarding.
You know what's a real pity?
You don't even know the kind of man that you're walking away from.
Keep that money, you're losing something way more valuable.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that is right.
Geoffrey's the kind of guy that when you down  Yeah, he'll pretty much kick you.
No, no, I'm saying though, it's like you come home late, you know, to the crib you don't want your parents to know, Geoffrey will dime you out.
This is the man you're defending.
Yes.
He's also the man whose eyes welled up with pride when you walked through that door.
He's also the man that can't stop bragging about you to all his butler friends.
The man that didn't hesitate to empty out his life savings for his so-called son.
But you know what?
You go ahead.
You got a flight to catch.
I guess this thing must be broken.
You can go.
Oh, don't stop now.
- What's up, G?
- Oh, Master William.
I'm glad you're here.
What kind of bike do you think Frederick would like?
Mountain or racing?
We gotta talk, G. You think I'm spoiling him, don't you?
I think that ship has sailed.
Look, G, what I'm about to say is gonna hurt you.
It's gonna hurt you bad, but I'm gonna just cut to the chase.
Because I'm about to practically annihilate you.
All right?
But I'm gonna get right to it.
All right?
Because this is gonna sting real, real bad.
- I ain't doing no pussy-footing around - Master William hurt me already.
Frederick is not what he appears to be.
He stole from me.
He stole from you.
He's on a plane back to England with no intention of going to butler school.
And you're never gonna see him again.
Hello, Frederick.
Three out of four ain't bad.
What's going on?
I came here to give you this.
I don't understand.
Will, I thought you said we was going out tonight?
Here I come, y'all.
Well, Frederick?
I came here to scam money from the father I never knew.
But somewhere along the way I realized I can't do this.
I suppose I'm not the son you thought I was.
I had no expectations.
Until yesterday, I didn't even know I had a son.
But you knew you had a father whom you'd never met.
Frederick what you did was not out of malice towards me it was out of confusion and anger.
So you forgive me?
That is what fathers do.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hey, hey.
Look.
Y'all will never guess what I got here.
All right, all right.
Don't tell me.
A rabbit.
Yeah.
I'm really good at this.
Ha-ha.
- This is Nicky's Easter present.
- Oh, he'll love it.
Aww.
Oh, look at the little lumpy bumpy bunny wunny.
This little guy brings back memories.
He reminds me of my rabbit, Snowball.
What?
You had a rabbit?
Oh, yeah.
I'll never forget how upset I was the day Snowball disappeared.
But I was okay once Dad explained Snowball's mommy and daddy had to take her back to their hutch because they were so Ionely without her.
I remember.
That was the Easter Grandma Hattie came over and made that secret stew.
What was that?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Of course, you do.
- It tasted like chicken but it wasn't.
- Hilary.
Oh, my God.
I remember that stew.
It was delicious.
Geoffrey, you gotta make that stew.
Don't tempt me.
Tell old pharaoh Let my people go  Tell old pharaoh Let my cousin grow Carlton, give it up.
Reverend Sims is gonna give me the Easter solo, not you.
Ha-ha.
Oh, well.
- I'm gonna put my golf clubs away, okay?
- Alrighty.
Hello, Reverend Sims.
Did you have a good golf game?
- Well - And that is a lovely golf shirt.
Why, thank you, Ashley.
Would you look at that?
Shameful sucking up.
Oh, Carlton, hey.
I really wanna thank you for that lovely sweater you sent me.
But you know that Choirmaster Hawkins makes the final decision on who sings that Easter solo.
Oh.
I knew that.
Great, now I'm gonna have to buy another sweater.
- What's going on?
- All right, Will.
- Well, I'm gonna go upstairs and practice.
- All right.
So, Will, I haven't seen you at the church lately.
Oh, I be in the back.
Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Vivian.
- Gordon, how are you?
I'm so glad you stopped in.
I baked you a sweet potato pie.
What's the occasion?
Thanking you for getting the children so involved in Church activities.
Bringing the families back to Church is always a priority of mine.
And since Margaret passed, it really helps to fill the void.
Maybe you could help me with Will.
Yes, Will, sure would be nice to see you down at the church.
Oh.
Yeah, Rev, you know, Sunday's kind of a bad day for me, you know what with Saturday usually being a late-night night you know what I'm talking about?
But I tell you what, y'all get something kicked off on a Tuesday, I'm there.
As a matter of fact, your aunt is coming by to finish up work on the fundraiser for the new youth center tomorrow.
So why don't you come on by and help decorate the church for Easter?
Shoo.
Tomorrow, gosh.
Man.
You know, any other day but tomorrow I could've done it, you know.
Even yesterday.
Even yesterday.
But Pbbt.
Well, that's really too bad.
You know, the ladies would love having a strong young man around there to help them out.
- Ladies?
- Ladies.
- There's gonna be some honeys up in there?
- I can guarantee at least a couple honeys.
Heh.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Come on down there and I get myself a little sticky, you know what I'm talking You know.
You know what I'm saying.
You know, because honey is sticky.
You know.
Ladies, here I go, let the decorating begin.
Oh, this nice young man has come here to help us.
My, what a handsome devil.
And I feel kind of devilish.
Whoo!
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, man.
Oh, I got a page.
Oh, it's 911.
Tupac just got arrested again.
I need to go.
I didn't hear any pager.
Oh, um Well, this is the kind that vibrates.
I didn't see your hip vibrating.
Wish I had though.
So, Will, how are things going with the decorating committee?
Not too bad.
Except for all them old ladies down there pinching my cheeks.
Well, Will, that's the way old ladies are.
They see a young man with a cute face, they love to pinch his cheeks.
I ain't talking about my face.
I love Harry.
I'm gonna keep him forever.
Yeah, unless Grandma Hattie pulls another Fatal Attraction.
Will.
I'm gonna keep him happy and healthy.
Well, if that's the case, man, you gotta work him out.
I mean, even rabbits need exercise.
You gotta teach him, like, some aerabbits.
Rock, rock the rabbit, rock Don't stop   There are certain responsibilities that go along with having a pet.
You have to feed him, wash him, clean up his mess.
Just don't expect a thank you.
Hey.
Hey, stop playing, Verna.
Ain't nobody that nearsighted.
Hey.
How y'all doing?
Hey, let me tell you, your cookies are really, really good.
He's only saying that.
The only ones he really like are mine.
Your cookies suck.
Well, suck this.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Stop, stop it.
Stop.
Rose.
Would y'all stop?
Rose, stop it.
Stop it.
I ain't playing.
Rose.
I ain't playing, all right?
I ain't playing.
Now stop it.
Come on, y'all.
We got a lot of work to do here.
Who wants to hold the ladder while I put up this banner?
- I'm gonna do it.
- No.
I wanna do it.
Hey, listen, you both can hold the ladder for me.
Will, you're doing a great job.
We really appreciate it.
You know, it does feel good to give something back to the communit  Hey.
- was blind But now I see Thank you.
Ashley, that was very good.
Thanks.
Nice try.
Now watch how it's done.
Make a note.
Unruly.
Michael, row your boat ashore Hallelujah Michael, row your boat ashore Hallelujah Hit it.
Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah Sister, help to trim the sail, Hallelujah The river is deep, the river is wide Hallelujah Milk and honey on the other side Hallelu-lu-lu-lu-lu-jah Michael, row.
Row that boat ashore.
Gordon, can you believe we're almost done?
You have done such a wonderful job for the children.
No, no.
We have done a wonderful job.
Vivian, I would have been lost without you.
Well, it's easy to get people to donate when it's for a man of your reputation.
You know, I haven't enjoyed working so closely with someone in a long, long time.
I've loved working with you too.
It's a shame it's all over.
It doesn't have to be.
What?
Vivian, I've always been in love with you.
- Hey, Aunt Viv.
- Hi, honey.
- You okay?
- Sure, I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
Well, first of all, because you seasoning the chicken with cleanser.
Look, I saw what happened down at the church.
Will, I don't know what to do.
I don't know whether to tell Philip or not.
If I tell him, he's gonna be furious.
This whole thing doesn't make any sense.
Makes sense to me.
Look like the Rev's trying to get his hallelujah on.
Honey, he's an old friend of the family's, and he's close with your uncle.
My God, why did he have to do this?
Hey!
Whoo-hoo!
Uncle Phil, what's going on, man?
Oh, man, what's going on, boy?
Shoot.
Hey.
I was asking you what's going on because there ain't nothing going on in here.
There's nothing going I wanted to know with you.
Did you have something going on?
Because we don't have any.
Oh Vivian, could you have Geoffrey put out an extra plate tonight?
I've invited Reverend Sims for dinner.
You can't.
Uh Ain't enough chicken.
I mean, there's too much chicken.
You know what they say about ministers.
You know, they will eat and eat and eat until they die.
Yeah.
They're like goldfish.
You are a very odd young man.
One, two, one, two.
Come on, Harry, give me another one.
Be all that you can be I'm gonna get you some lettuce, Harry.
You stay right here.
Uh  Harry, I'm coming.
Oh.
Where's Harry?
Uh He went upstairs, boom, two steps at a time.
I guess he was really hungry.
- Where's his box?
- He took it with him.
Because he knew it didn't belong down here, he put it away.
But if he was hungry, why didn't he just come in the kitchen?
Nicky, he's just a rabbit.
Harry.
Come here, boy.
Come here, Harry.
I need you to go to a pet shop, find a rabbit that looks just like Harry.
- But I don't have the time, Daddy.
- Please.
I don't feel like it.
And get yourself some shoes.
Bye, Daddy.
- Hey, Uncle Phil.
- Oh, Will, something terrible has happened.
- I know.
- I didn't mean to kill him.
What?
What?
Uncle Phil, you killed him?
- Oh, my God.
Does anybody know?
- Hilary may suspect.
She came in right after it happened.
I mean, it was an accident.
Okay, good.
Good.
You said that like you really believed it.
It was an accident, Will.
Hey, hey, man, I'm not the one you gotta convince.
Nicky is gonna be very upset.
What?
I think Nicky is the least of your worries.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Uncle Phil, go upstairs, pack a bag.
I'm gonna get the car.
We gonna shoot down to Tijuana.
We gonna chill in Mexico, this whole thing blows over.
Will, they don't arrest you for sitting on a rabbit.
- You killed Harry.
- Yeah.
You killed Harry.
Ah!
That's great, man.
You killed Harry.
Oh.
Will, who did you think I killed?
I thought you killed Harry.
- Nicky.
- Nicky.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, buddy.
I still can't find Harry.
Oh, he'll show up.
Hey, hey.
- Did you get the rabbit?
- Yeah, but, l Nicky, good news.
Hilary found Harry.
Heh-heh.
It was all they had.
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Oh, thank you, Uncle Phil.
Gordon, you are gonna love Vivian's chicken.
Heh-heh.
Would you prefer a breast or thigh?
Uh!
He'll take a wing.
Reverend, by any chance, did you happen to speak to the choirmaster today?
From what I understand, there's some very, very stiff competition for the solo this year.
Well, would he ever ask you for your advice?
Well, that's a possibility.
Would you mind  passing the peas, please?
Could you pass the pork dork?
So how are things down at the church?
- Fine.
- Yes, fine.
I could use another boiled potato, please Thank you Would you excuse me for a minute, please?
I can't wait to hear this year's Easter sermon.
Last year's was very inspiring.
Yeah, you might wanna cover all the commandments this year.
Vivian, I need to talk to you.
- Why don't you go in and finish your dinner?
- Vivian, I am sorry about what happened.
- It was a mistake.
- It certainly was.
Look, I haven't spent much time with a woman since Margaret passed.
I guess I got confused, I lost my way.
- I realize there is no excuse for it, but - You're right, there is no excuse.
Gordon, this is really making me uncomfortable.
Well, maybe it's best if I just leave.
I think that's a good idea.
Where's Gordon going?
Oh, an emergency came up.
He told me to say goodbye to everybody.
Let's go have a nice dinner.
Are you all right?
Yes, honey, I'm all right now.
Daddy, you know how you told me that Harry's black now because rabbits change colors for Easter?
Isn't there a little more to that story?
Well, yes.
Uh Nicky, you remember in The Lion King when Mufasa?
Daddy, did you sit on Harry?
- Yes.
But But - That's okay, Dad.
Death is a natural part of life.
But what a way to go.
And as it says in Matthew: "If a man has 100 sheep and one strays does he not leave the 99 on the mountain to search for the stray one"?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, yes.
"And if he finds it, he is happy over finding that one than over the 99 that did not stray".
MAN 1: Glory.
- Tell the truth now, pastor.
Well, you see, the truth is I am one of the flock.
And every now and then I too must ask for forgiveness, as we all do.
MAN 2: Oh, yes.
- That's right.
And I can only pray that the Lord and those I have offended will forgive me.
MAN 3: Okay, now.
MAN 4: Amen.
"For if you forgive men for their transgressions your Heavenly Father will also forgive you".
Amen.
MAN 5: That's right.
Amen.
Amen.
Now I am proud to present this year's Easter hymn.
Now, traditionally, the Easter hymn is a showcase for one voice.
However, this year, I'm proud to announce that we have a duo.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, we do.
I want you all to please help me welcome Ashley and Carlton Banks.
- Yes, hallelujah.
- Yes.
Praise the Lord.

Let me, uh Let me break you off a little something here.
First of all, you gotta have a concept.

TV Weather Girl.
When I don't have my head in the clouds, I like to relax with a nice hot cup of  Hot cup of Well, at first, I said Ah, shoot.
Damn it.
- And then what'd you say?
- I forgot.
The next thing I said, when I don't have my Oh, shoot.
- The next thing I said - Hilary, how many takes did you do?
Only 41.
You'd think that would tire me out.
But I'm more awake now than when we started.
What's wrong?
I'm serious, Daddy.
I'm not gonna just sit here and watch you eat yourself into an early grave.
- Ha, ha.
So you're gonna throw a fork at me?
- I tried to keep going.
Do you swear to tell the truth so help you God?
Ha, ha, ha.
I'm sorry.
With an old raggedy halter top that say, "Yeah, boy".
So sorry.
With an old raggedy halter top that say, "Heh"!
The camera's on me.
I thought the camera was just on him.
I can't deal with this.
Just for no reason, you'll say, "Dum-dum-dee-day".
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Geoffrey, guess what.
- Will saw Heh, heh.
I'm sorry.
- Good job.
Thank you.
Good job.
Oh, yeah, see, she messed her line up, though.

Ha, ha.
Oh, I'm totally I'm so sorry.
No, no!
Help me.
Oh, no.
This is not happening.
Ha, ha, ha.
What are you guys doing?
You completely messed me up.
I looked over and you had this vacant look in your eyes.
I remember it.
I wanted to go home.
But don't blame me for you messing up.
- That was the fifth take.
- Me, messing up?
- Excuse me.
- What?
I'm just trying to figure out why I couldn't put some lipstick on somebody.
What is this thing about lipstick you got going on?
All right.
We've known each other for six years.
- I should be able to put lipstick on you.
- You got a lipstick thing going on.
- You're disrespecting me.
- We have known each other for six years.
I think it's his turn for lipstick.
He's never gotten any.
Have a seat.
- Why y'all getting all strong?
- His eyebrows need plucking.
- Oh, his eyebrows.
Yes.
- Don't be tweezing my eyebrows.
Right there.
- Get off me.
Get off No, get off me.
Get off me.
All right.
Now, that's enough.
Y'all play too daggone much.
They be playing too much.
Now, come on, let's go somewhere where we appreciated.

Hey.
Oh, everybody.

I was just showing them clips of everybody messing their lines up.
But not you, man.
You are refined.
You British.
You special, man.
State of the art, boy.
- Thank you, Will.
- Oh, no.
I mean, I'm just saying when you step out on that stage, man, you just get out there and you hit it.
Blam!
- Blam.
- That's right.
- Thank you, again, Will.
- Yeah, right.
When she's not looking, break one of her crystal fusiliers.
I'm hawking candy bars.
They're only 5 bucks.
Marvelous.
Why is it marvelous?
- Well, I'm off for the weekend.
- Where you going, Geoffrey?
- Where am I going?
You don't even know where you going.
I've not a clue.
And you are left alone standing in the dark.
They've started their women's weekend of nothing but facials, massages and  I guess all that British stuff went right out the window, huh?
Ha, ha.
I'm an actor, not a machine.
Yeah, whatever.
Just lose the phony accent.
Well Ooh!
If I had a watch on, I'd know I was late.
I gotta go get my face right.
I gotta get my wardrobe and everything together.
For the past six years, we always come together right before the show.
So y'all stay tuned because it's showtime.

I'm sorry, Dick.
I'll see you later, all right?
Thanks a lot.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hey.
Nicky.
Whew.
What's up, man?
Mommy and Daddy won't let me watch Bad Boys.
Bad Boys, huh?
What you gonna do?
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna run away from home.
Oh, Nick.
Man, come here.
- You're running away from home?
- That's right.
I'm out of here.
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on a second, there, little traveling man.
You running away from home, you gonna need some food.
You know, bums, they don't like to share.
Here you go, a little grub.
And it gets a little chilly out in that night air so you probably need a jacket and a hat.
Yeah.
Oh, you know.
And here's a few bucks, you know, in case something jump off out there.
All right.
You good to go, little bro.
Aren't you gonna try and stop me?
Try to stop you?
No, man, with you gone that's more food for me, you know.
Plus, I get to keep your turtle and that banging little bike you got.
My turtle and my bike?
I mean, somebody gotta claim all that stuff.
All right, I'll stay.
But not because I'm scared.
Not because you're taking my stuff.
And not because of that reverse psychology you tried to use on me.
Well, then why you gonna stay?
I'm 5, you dork.
Yee-ha!
Giddyup, giddyup.
Hey, come on, G. It's your turn.
Get on.
Get on.
Come on.
Get on, G. G, just get on, man.
Oh, what the heck.
What, you some kind of freak, boy?
Hey, G, we're going down to the race track today, man.
You wanna put a couple of ones on a bet?
Well, I'm not much of a gambler, Master William, but since you're going back wheel the eighth with the one on top of the two, three and six.
And in the fifth, par tri the three eight with the two and five.
You got yourself a secret life going, don't you, G?
Will, which one do you think your friend Frank will like best?
This one?
Or this one?
God, I wanna get into the New York School of Performing Arts so bad.
Well, Ash, I don't think they pick their students by what they're wearing.
Do you think he'll recommend me?
Not if you keep spinning around like that, girl.
Hey, everybody, look.
Wednesday Bingo is running out of post position five.
Not post position five!
That's his favorite position.
It's the same position he had when he won his first race.
I still remember him standing in that winner's circle Iooking up to me as if to say: "Tsk, tsk.
This one's for you, little man".
You sure his tail wasn't up in the air at the time?
Mom.
Mommy, wish me luck.
I really wanna get into that school in New York.
- Oh, good luck, honey.
- Thank you.
New York.
Isn't that a bit of a drive every morning?
How cute, Daddy.
I'd have to live there, of course.
Of course you would, muffin.
Of course, it's always been my dream to send my underage daughter off to New York unsupervised.
Isn't that every parent's dream?
Daddy, you'll warm to the idea.
Sweetheart, just remember that the road to New York goes through me.
What, that be like a six-lane highway?
Well, Mom, you're okay with it, right?
She feels the same way I do, don't you, darling?
There's plenty of time to discuss this later.
Huh?
- Thanks, Mom.
Hey.
You wanna make this first race?
We gotta go.
Let's go.
- Okay.
Bye.
- Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.
Have a good time.
Vivian, if we don't stick together, they'll win.
Ladies and gentlemen, five minutes to post time.
I'm so excited.
I just know I'm gonna win.
I have a system that can't miss.
Oh, yeah?
What's that?
I bet on every horse.
Hilary, one of them has to win.
I know and it doesn't matter which one.
Isn't it great?
Where's Carlton?
Oh, he's in the stables with the jockeys.
He's never been the tallest person in a room before.
- Hey, Frank.
Hey, what's up, man?
- Hey.
Hey, thanks for these great seats.
- Oh, this is my cousin, Hilary.
- Hi.
And this is my cousin, Ashley.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Will says you wanna go to the School for the Performing Arts.
- More than anything.
That's where I learned to be a director.
Really?
You studied directing there?
No, acting, but I sucked.
My old acting partner is head of the school now.
- Guess he couldn't even direct, huh?
- Oh, you're smart.
You should produce.
Come by the office tomorrow.
We'll call him up.
Oh, yeah.
That'd be great.
I'll be there at 7.
I'll be there at noon.
Feel free to have a bagel while you wait.
Some short stack told me to get out of the paddock area.
God, that feels great to say.
Heh-heh.
They're at the gate.
The flag is up.
And they're off.
It's Rest Darling in front, Daddy's Best, second and Lilac Lady, third.
I can feel it.
He's about to make his move.
He ain't even leave the gate yet, man.
Well, he's just psyching out the other horses.
At the wire, it's Rest Darling by a nose.
Lilac Lady, second and Daddy's Best, third.
Wednesday Bingo is taking a nap.
You just wait till he wakes up.
Shoo!
Will, Frank said he'd help me get into the School of Performing Arts.
Do you think he meant it?
Ashley, how many times do I have to tell you?
Yes.
No, no, no.
Really, Will, do you think he will?
Ashley, the man is in show business, he wouldn't lie.
All right.
All right.
Look, he'll help you.
Oh, look at him.
He looks so sad.
- Aww.
- Oh, he's so cute.
Oh.
Will, cheer him up.
Sing him a song.
Man, I ain't singing him no song.
The sun'll come out Tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar That tomorrow There'll be sun I'm afraid the sun won't be coming out tomorrow for that old boy.
What do you mean?
Too many years.
Too many races.
The owner wants me to put him down.
When?
Tomorrow.
It's only a day away Oh.
And this was when he was just a yearling.
Oh, and look, this is when he won his first race.
Look, Will.
Carlton, I ain't trying to be looking at that horse all day, man.
Now, look, just watch some TV and take your mind off of it, all right?
MALE VOICE : Hello.
I'm Mister Ed.
You bastard!
Wow, Carlton seems pretty upset.
I think what he needs is a refreshing pick-me-up beverage that's not too sweet and not too heavy.
What?
You know my motto.
If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
And when they do, don't sweat, drink Jet.
Jet cola that is.
Oh, my God.
You been sipping that gin and juice.
Hi, guys.
Oh, Ashley, look.
Now eat these mints and whatever you do, don't talk.
Here.
I don't need a mint.
Mom, I went to see Mr. Roberts about the High School of the Performing Arts and he offered me a commercial for Jet cola.
- Oh, that's great!
Let's go tell your dad.
- Okay.
This don't seem that hard.
You know my motto.
If you're a woman on the go like me, things can get rough.
And when they do, don't sweat, y'all.
Drink Jet.
Jet cola that is.
Well, then, be a woman on the go.
Leave so I can vacuum.
- Hey, Frank, what's up, man?
- Hi, Will.
How's it going?
All right.
I'm just coming down, check on Ashley.
- She's a little nervous before her first shoot.
- She's gonna be just fine.
Okay, girls.
Places, please.
Let's go.
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
You mean, you just say it and they do it?
Okay, girls get naked.
Uh Simon says, get naked.
Okay, people.
First positions, please.
We're losing the light.
Let's get this rolling.
Hey, Frank.
I got to tell you, man, it's guys like you make life worth living.
Bringing all these beautiful women to us during all our favorite programs.
Mm.
Man, you ought to have a billboard with your face on it.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Will.
Will.
- That's a wrap!
- I am so sorry.
There is no way I'm gonna let her parade around on some beach hawking Jet cola in nothing but a skimpy bikini.
And showing that can all over national TV.
And I ain't talking about the soda.
Carlton, this is crazy.
Hilary, we had no choice.
We needed a place till we find him a permanent home.
What's gonna happen if Dad finds out there's a horse in the back yard?
He'll blame Will like he always does.
Oh, okay.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Don't you "hi, Daddy" me.
Just when were you planning on telling me about your little soft-core drink commercial?
You.
We would've found out eventually.
Yeah, even though they're not showing that much of her face.
I don't believe this.
You're both being hypocrites.
You sit there glued to the set anytime Baywatch comes on.
That's only because I have trouble sleeping and the sound of the waves gently caressing the shore helps relax me.
Nice cover.
Nice cov Ashley, you're not doing this commercial.
Mom, can you talk to him?
I'm afraid your father feels very strongly about this.
I just can't quit the commercial.
How's it look if I walk out on the person who's gonna give me the recommendation?
I don't care.
This is more important.
And you're not going to New York, either.
What about what I want?
Doesn't that matter?
No.
No, no, whoa.
I am telling you, Uncle Phil, I was there and that commercial was nothing but a disgusting, gratuitous display of Just call it what it is.
Smut.
- You don't think I was too rough on Ashley?
- Are you tripping?
You are the leader of the pack.
It is your right.
No, no, no.
Scratch that.
It is your duty as a male to assert your dominance.
There, I said it, your dominance.
Really?
Because your Aunt Vivian wasn't as supportive of my approach.
Your approach?
Man, I got one thing to say about your approach: Woof, woof, woof.
You are the king of the jungle, Mufasa.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
- You are the ruler of all that you survey.
- Yes.
- You will be obeyed!
- I will be obeyed!
- That's right.
- Yes.
Hi, sweetie, you look awfully pretty.
Well, I guess I showed her.
You ain't nothing but Simba.
What's up, Ash?
What you watching?
You know, I have no idea what got into the big guy!
You got into him.
- You're the rat that dimed me out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute, Ashley.
Now that hurts.
I'm offended by that characterization.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You don't like rat.
How about snake?
Weasel?
Doody-head?
Don't be calling me no doody-head.
You know how much going to the School of Performing Arts means to me and how much that commercial would help.
That commercial was degrading.
Oh, really?
It was?
Which part?
The part where I'm in clothes driving the car?
The part where I'm in sweats drinking the cola?
The part where I'm Rollerblading?
No.
All you focused on were the seven seconds I was in a bathing suit playing volleyball.
I play volleyball in a bathing suit all the time.
Am I degrading myself?
I didn't know about all them other parts.
Exactly.
Because you didn't ask.
All that mattered to you and Dad was your narrow-minded maleness.
You know, this job may not be my dream job but, regardless, it's my dream.
You and Dad have nothing to do with it.
You know what?
I should just go and do it anyway.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Now Now, I realize you're excited and you're a little upset but Uncle Phil is a big man.
He's a very big man with a very short fuse.
Bad combination.
Very bad combination.
Goodbye.
Bad talk.
Very bad talk.
Here you go.
Nick, have I ever kept you from achieving your dreams?
Not many.
I mean, you wouldn't call me narrow-minded, would you?
You just don't get it, do you?
I'm 5, you dork.
Yeah, you're right.
I should just be talking to Ashley.
Is she here?
Nope.
She's at the commercial.
- What?
- What?
Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey.
Well, Uncle Phil, man.
How long you been standing there?
You know, you're a light stepper for a big fella.
What did you just say, Nicky?
Ashley's at the commercial.
Oh, how could she do this, huh?
In direct defiance of The king of the jungle?
We'll see about this.
What?
Now, Uncle Phil, calm down, man.
All right?
It ain't that serious.
Big man, short fuse.
Bad combination.
- Well, she's not here, Uncle Phil.
Let's go.
- We just got here.
Well, you know, Uncle Phil, as I look around you know, the level of nakedness isn't as high as I had previously assumed.
Will, you know, ever since we've left the house you seemed a little distracted.
You know, what ever happened to that: Woof, woof, woof.
Oh, heh.
Well, that's still there, man.
Woof, woof, woof.
You know, Uncle Phil, I don't even think that Ashley's here!
Ashley.
Daddy, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
You defied me.
Now, you go get your clothes and you come with me right now.
- Daddy, l - I don't wanna hear it.
Coming down here and doing this commercial after I expressly forbade it.
I just quit the commercial.
Well Uh You should be ashamed of yourself.
Not trusting Ashley.
I knew she would never do it.
Mama knows, child.
Come here.
Shut up, Will.
Listen, I'm taking over.
I need to know where your wardrobe is.
Um, it's in the dressing room in the back.
Too bad your daddy won't let you do the commercial.
Better off leaving it to the big girls.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Whoo-hoo.
Little cat in you, huh, girl?
Little leopard skirt on.
You know, let's just go.
Yep.
You better make it home before Saved by the Bell starts.
Excuse me, miss.
No one talks to my daughter that way.
So maybe you and your little horsehair weave should just mosey on before I get really upset.
Better some horsehair than some no hair.
Wait.
I don't think so.
- Oh, no.
Ashley.
Ashley.
Ashley.
- It ain't worth it.
It ain't worth it.
Sweetheart, you go to your dressing room and put on your costume.
Because I think Frank's gonna need some class to sell his drink.
Daddy, you're gonna let me do the commercial?
- It's up to you if you want to.
- Oh, Daddy, thank you.
Ha-ha.
Oh.
And, by the way, your mother.
Mama.
It's "mama," Ashley.
Mama.
It's "your mama".
Hey, Ashley, I gotta tell you.
I think this commercial thing is gonna be all right.
You know, all them new friends you made today.
How you got all their telephone numbers.
That was cool.
I'll give you $20 apiece for each of them.
Hey, except for that cat girl.
She had a beard.
Daddy, did you hear?
Frank said I'm a shoo-in for the School of Performing Arts.
I'm as good as in New York.
I've said it before and I'll say it again.
No, no, no.
What happened to you being more open-minded?
I am open-minded, sweetheart.
And any commercial you wanna shoot here in the greater Los Angeles area hey, I'm on board.
Will, what do you think?
Hey, I have nothing but love and respect for the both of you.
Oh, Mom.
Come on.
Can you convince Dad it's all right for me to move to New York?
Tell her she is too young to move anywhere.
I moved out of the horse when I was 17.
Horse?
House.
Um I gotta go do this thing with Uh Bye.
No, no.
Wait.
Mom, I gotta talk to you.
- Hmm.
She's acting oddly.
- Yeah.
Want me to get you some Pepto-Bismol, Uncle Phil?
- Wednesday Bingo, get up.
- Get up off the couch.
Please.
Come on.
- Get up, Wednesday Bingo.
Get up, please.
- You can't stay here.
- They were gonna kill him.
- And we saved him.
- We needed to find a farm.
- We found one but - He doesn't wanna go.
- And it's hard to move this kind of girth.
You can relate to that, Uncle Phil.
- We can explain.
- We can explain.
- He did it.
- He did it.
What?
Hey.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hey, Will.
What's up?
How come you're not dressed for the golf tournament?
I'm not playing this year.
- Y'all play every year.
- Yeah, and every year we lose.
Frankly, I'm sick of being a big loser.
Come on, C, you're not big.
Besides, I made other plans.
I'm attending a seminar on how to buy foreclosed properties.
You wouldn't believe the money to be made kicking people out of their own homes.
Such a big heart for such a little man.
Boy, I can't wait to hit those links.
Ha-ha-ha.
How about you, partner?
Bad news, big guy.
I made other plans.
Other plans?
Carlton, this is a Banks' tradition.
With you going off to Princeton in the fall this is one of the last chances we're gonna have to play golf and spend some quality time together.
- I'm sorry, big guy.
Oh.
Seem to me you gonna need somebody to replace him, Uncle Phil.
Right, right, right.
But who?
Ah.
Fore.
Uhn.
Oh, Will, would you like to play?
- Oh, me?
No Yes.
- Mm.
Hi, guys.
I'm in the golf tournament this year with Uncle Phil, and we are definitely gonna win.
Please, all you men think about is win, win, win.
Well, that's not exactly all we think about, if you know what I'm talking about.
Ha.
You know what I'm saying, C?
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley's right.
Take us for example.
We enter the club tennis tournament every year just for the fun of it.
Just because we win, doesn't make it any more fun.
Exactly.
Of course, we don't have losing to compare it to.
You go, girl.
Well, Will, if we're gonna be partners, we'd better get in some practice, huh?
- Let's go to the club and hit a few balls.
- Right behind you.
Will, Will.
Listen, just out of curiosity, what is the other thing men think about?
Oh, goody.
I thought I was going to run out of things to do today.
Good God, Geoffrey, this place is a mess.
Miss Hilary, it's comments like that, that makes this job worthwhile.
Geoffrey, Regis Philbin is going to be here any minute.
Ah.
Another pair of hands to lighten the load.
This is important.
Kathie Lee has the flu.
He's looking for a co-host while he's in Los Angeles.
Whoa, that's a big deal, Hil.
Hey, anything I can do to help?
Yeah.
Don't talk to him.
I don't want anyone to mess it up by saying something stupid.
It's going to be a very quiet meeting.
Oh, pretty, pretty, please.
Let me get it.
Will, there is one thing you can do to help me.
- Oh, anything, Hil.
Name it.
- Leave.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Mr. Regis Philbin.
Hilary.
Hilary, it's great to finally meet you.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Philbin.
- Please, call me Regis.
Hey, what's up, Regis?
You can call me Mr. Philbin.
That's a joke.
- I got him.
- I love this guy.
Look, I'm on my way to the studio so I'll cut right to the chase, Hilary.
If you're available, we'd love for you to substitute for Kathie Lee this week.
- I'd love to.
Thank you.
Yes.
- Would you?
Great.
Listen, I gotta run but I'll see you later at rehearsal.
- Okay.
- Okay?
Great.
Listen, by the way, try reversing your grip.
It'll keep you from pushing the putt to the right.
Oh, I'll try it.
Thanks a lot, Reg.
Hey, don't ever call me Reg.
Okay.
Boy, you are so funny, Reg.
No, I'm serious.
Don't ever call me Reg.
Well, if it isn't Martina and Steffi.
How'd the first round of your tournament go?
Great.
We won.
But then again, we always do.
Yes.
Black number five, coming up.
"Black number five coming up.
Ha-ha-ha".
Hey, Uncle Phil.
Dude, I was just at the range.
Man, I was El Kabong-ing that joint a mile.
And I'm gonna pretend I ain't see that little dance you was just doing.
Okay.
Look, Will.
I have to go to the pro shop and pick up a sand wedge.
What?
A sandwich?
Uncle Phil, we just had breakfast a half hour ago.
Will, I said "sand wedge".
It's a club.
Yeah, I know.
Turkey, bacon, three layers of white toast.
- Banks.
- Mercer.
Whoa, your son really shot up this year.
This is my nephew.
- Will, this is Bob Mercer.
- How you doing?
- And his son, Bobby.
- What's up, man?
They've been club champions for three years.
Four.
Soon to be five.
Well, I wouldn't be so sure.
I just bought a new set of clubs.
Now you need somebody to swing them for you and you could have a shot.
Oh!
Hey, Mercer, you should save that dazzling wit for the courtroom.
You might even win a case.
So our makeup room is around the corner, the control booth is upstairs and this is our set.
Can I get you in your positions?
We wanna get a light reading.
- Sure.
- Great.
Oof.
I hate to be a stickler, but that's my chair.
Oh, well, would you mind if I sat here?
You see, my right side has been rated my better side.
So it'd be in my best interest to be sitting on this side.
It would be in my best interest if I could sit in the same chair I've been sitting in for the last 15 years.
Fine.
Big baby.
Well, now, we usually start off the show by announcing our guests and then we have a little banter, go to a commercial bring out the first guest.
Well, that's a good way.
But what if we do it the way we do it on my show?
Which is we bring out the guest first and then we do that little banter thing later.
Again, we've been using this format for many, many years and it seems to work, you know?
You know the old saying, "If it ain't broke" I'm drawing a blank here.
Don't fix it.
Fix what?
It.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
What's it?
What are you talking about?
You know, maybe we'd better skip the banter altogether, you know?
Big baby.
Oh, man.
That pro shot on 18 was something else.
Hold up, I don't care what you say, I ain't never seen a shot like you hit on 16.
Sounds like you guys won.
Hell, no, how could we?
He's an even worse golfer than you.
So why are you so happy?
Oh, we had a great time.
- You had a great time losing?
- Yeah.
I gotta tell you.
We ain't spent quality time like that together in years.
Well, wait till tomorrow when we really get our butts kicked.
How about we throw a couple steaks on the grill and discuss our losing strategy for tomorrow?
Great idea.
I'll go start the barbie.
Dad, you know, there's a chance I may be free to play tomorrow.
I wouldn't want you to miss your foreclosure seminar.
I really won't be missing that much.
I mean, once the police come and toss the family out, it's mostly paperwork.
Well, Carlton, Will and I will be just fine.
Let me tell you, this dude right here is just straight loqued-out on a golf course, man.
You are the one who managed to get the golf cart up on two wheels, with me in it.
That's no easy trick.
Come on, you gotta show me how you managed to miss those 1-foot putts.
All you gotta do is not concentrate.
- I ain't tripping.
- You crack me up.
I can not concentrate.
You ever done something because you thought it was right but then felt really stupid about what you did?
Yes, but I'm still working here.
I was talking about the golf tournament.
I made other plans because I didn't wanna play but then I saw Will and Dad having so much fun And now you're jealous.
Now Will and Dad are buddies and I feel like an idiot.
Well, you shouldn't.
Not because of that anyway.
Look everyone makes mistakes.
The point is to learn from them.
And most important, not to try to solve your problems with hasty immature actions.
Hey, man, look what happened to my golf clubs.
Bet it was that dirty boy Bobby Mercer.
You know, it's always the quiet ones.
Will.
Will.
Are you ready to go?
- What happened?
- Hey, man, I don't know.
I guess there's only one solution.
- I'll get my clubs.
- Great.
You can play with Carlton's clubs.
Wait, Carl?
What, I'm supposed to play on my knees?
I guess you're stuck then.
Never fear, Carlton Banks is here.
I'll change my plans and take Will's place.
I don't want you to miss your seminar.
- No, no, no, I don't mind.
- No, I have a better idea.
I'll just buy you a new set.
You're gonna need them because we're gonna be playing a lot of golf together.
Why not?
I guess I can play just as bad with the news ones as I did with the old ones.
- Maybe worse.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Shoot, with my swing, I might as well play with these.
- Geoffrey, would you mind?
- Oh, I suppose not, Master Carlton.
You know, Regis, I know we've already covered this ground but I'd really like to sit on that side.
Hilary, Hilary.
Relax, you look great.
The show is gonna be great regardless of where we sit.
Let's just do the show and forget about it.
Counting.
In, five, four, three, two Hi, everybody.
Welcome to Live With Regis and my guest host for today, Ms. Hilary Banks.
- Thank you for having me.
- The pleasure's all mine.
- We're gonna have a great show today.
- We sure are.
Today on the show, we have ghostbuster Ernie Hudson.
- And direct from Milan, we have - Hilary, Hilary.
I usually announce the guests.
Oh, well, then go ahead.
And direct from Milan, one of the preeminent fashion designers Miss Isabella Fonte.
Now, what is the deal with your Los Angeles freeways?
I'm driving down the San Diego Tell me about it.
I'm driving along, 90 miles per hour I'm putting my makeup on when the phone rings and I spill my Frappuccino all over my Louis Vuitton sports bag.
- Hilary.
Hilary, what are you doing?
- I'm bantering.
- It takes two people to banter.
- Not when I do it.
What do you say we bring out our guest?
A woman who defines fashion, Miss Isabella Fonte, ladies and gentlemen.
- Yes.
Hi, Isabella.
How are you?
- Good.
Nice to have you.
Have a seat right here.
It's so good to see you.
Ha!
- Mom?
- Ash, honey, a quick tip.
When that little round yellow fuzzy thing comes at you, take a swipe at it.
I'm sorry, Mom.
I guess I couldn't hear it coming.
Your outfit was too loud.
Ladies, ladies, whatever happened to teamwork?
- Ashley, you're my daughter and I love you.
- That's better.
But if you double fault one more time, I am going to put you up for adoption.
Great, maybe then I'll wind up with a mother who can hit a decent backhand.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Well, let me say it louder then.
I'm gonna grab us some water, you go grab the cart.
- Okay.
- All right.
Will.
- Hey, Mr. Jenkins.
Remember, you promised you were gonna meet my daughter.
Oh, yeah, that's cool, man.
As long as she ain't got a forehead like her daddy.
- That's a good one.
- Okay.
He told me he didn't have any children.
Hey, hey, Rich, Rich, Rich, I still owe you a couple bucks for them golf balls.
Your money's no good here, Will.
Now, put that away.
Carlton, you still owe me for those Milk Duds.
Carlton, what you doing here?
I thought if you didn't wanna play, I'd fill in for you.
No, I'm kind of getting the hang of this.
Looks like you and Dad have been having lots of fun.
We having a ball.
I really need to get out there.
- You sure you don't want me to play?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Will.
- Carlton, I'm playing.
Hey, Banks, why don't we save ourselves a lot of trouble?
We'll walk over to the 18th hole and you can just hand me the trophy.
Ha-ha-ha.
You keep talking, Mercer, and I'm gonna hand you something else.
Whoo!
I'm sorry I got this thing that every, you know just once in a while I  - Will?
Now, we're doing great.
- Right.
We're down four strokes with nine holes to go.
- I know it's not about winning or losing - No, no.
- but if you help me beat them, you'll never have to work another day in your life.
- Really?
- Well, no, but I'll buy you dinner.
All right, cool.
I'm gonna grab us a couple sodas, man.
- I'll meet you on the tenth.
- Okay.
Okay, good.
Carlton, what are you still doing here?
I wanna play, Will, please.
I wanna be a big loser and have fun like you and Dad.
- Wait, I can't just quit now.
- No, no, sure you can.
Come on, now help me put your clubs in the car.
Look, Carlton, no.
Look, I made a big mistake not playing in this tournament.
- You said you didn't even wanna play.
- I know, but I see you guys having fun and I realize Dad was right.
With me going to Princeton we won't have plenty of chances left to spend quality time together.
The time on the course wasn't about winning or losing it was about me being with my dad.
Um Guess I ain't think about it like that.
So you gonna let me play?
No, but we need a couple sodas, why don't you bring them out?
- All right, come on, Will, you're up.
- Oh, yeah.
Sure thing, Uncle Phil.
Whew.
- Got your sodas.
- Oh.
Hey, thanks a lot, C. I'll grab them from you as soon as I bust this joint.
I think I pulled my hamstring.
Will.
Will, how can you pull a hamstring playing golf?
I mean Ow!
My shoulder string.
Uh-oh.
An injury to a player could mean a forfeit.
Oh, it hurts real bad, Uncle Phil.
Well, that's okay, son.
Maybe next year.
Ow.
But wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hey, Carlton, come here.
Maybe you could bail me out.
I don't know.
What do you think, Dad?
What do I think?
Grab your club, son.
If you help me win this thing you'll never have to work another day in your life.
But you have fun.
If I make this putt, we win.
Carlton, whether we make this putt or not, it's been a great afternoon.
- How about if I just blow it?
- No, I think you should try to make it.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
But it doesn't matter, right?
- Carlton, will you just putt?
- Okay.
Okay.
You got it, boy.
I'm telling you - Will, would you just let him putt?
- All right, my bad.
- Thank you.
Oh, man, that was great.
Carlton, I gotta give you props.
You dropped that putt from deep.
Thanks, Will.
How about I come back every year from Princeton to play in the golf tournament?
- Oh, I'd love it.
How about I come back from wherever I'm at?
Why?
No reason.
Listen, I'm gonna go put this in the pool house.
- I mean, on the mantel in the library.
- Ah.
So, Will, how is that shoulder-string thing?
Ooh, ah.
Man, yeah.
You know, I need to go get something to rub on it.
Maybe you should.
Will?
I know what you did for your cousin, and I'm glad you did it.
Thank you.
Oh.
You're welcome, Uncle Phil.
Hey, I still get that dinner, right?
Yes, Will.
- Bring your Platinum card, boy.
- Oh, good.
Hey, what's up, Hil?
How'd it go with Reg?
Regis loves me for finally bringing a little flavor to the show.
The promo's about to come on.
Join us tomorrow when our guests will be Wynonna Judd Lisa Kudrow and Luke Perry.
And, of course, my beautiful guest co-host Miss Arthel Neville.
That's right, Reg, I'll be right here next to you all week.
Oh, great.
Now where am I supposed to sit?
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Come check this out.
Look at all this stuff I found up in the attic.
What?
Wh Why, that's my old trumpet.
I haven't seen that thing in ages.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, man, I didn't know you played the trumpet.
When I was in college a little bit, you know.
The girls all like a musician, you know?
I met him after Princeton.
Wow, look at all this stuff.
My old coloring books.
My diary.
Wait a minute, I didn't have Barbie.
Who had a Barbie?
Well, it's not mine.
My Barbie's at home fast asleep in her Barbie Dream House.
Um It doesn't matter whose it is.
Let me see this trumpet.
- Hey, hey, hey.
Morning, everybody.
- Morning, Will.
Oh.
Y'all remember, don't nobody mention to Carlton that William Shatner's gonna be on Hilary's show.
Don't you think you're being unfair?
He's coming on the show and you know Carlton is a huge fan of his.
Who's gonna be on Hilary's show, and who am I a huge fan of?
Uh Uh Uh Billy.
Billy who?
Uh Uh Uh Uh Billy Butterworth.
You are never going to believe what's happened.
Oh, yeah.
Billy Butterworth's gonna be on your show.
Big deal.
What are you talking about?
William Shatner's on the show.
Actor, director, novelist, bon vivant William Shatner?
And you knew?
You slept in the same pool house with me knowing this knowing what it would mean to me, and you didn't say a word?
I don't even know who you are.
Look, Carlton, it ain't like I'm Hello?
I wasn't finished.
- Hilary, you gotta introduce him to me.
- No.
The network is so thrilled with all of our great guests that they wanna move the show to New York.
- New York?
- Yeah.
There was a meeting with the VIPs and they think we're ready for the big time.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, Hilary.
I can't just uproot just like that.
Okay.
What do you mean "okay"?
- I'm gonna be out of a job.
- So come.
Hilary, I can't come.
I still gotta finish school.
- Okay.
- What?
Look, Hilary, how come I didn't find out about this before?
Oh, don't tell me someone withheld information from somebody.
So just like that, you're moving to New York and I'm out of a job.
Okay.
What about New York?
They're moving Hilary's show to New York.
Oh, my God, that's wonderful.
This is the best news I've ever heard.
It's unbelievable.
Ashley, you've never been this happy for me.
I still haven't been.
This is about me.
- I can still move to New York.
- Now, just hold on, young lady.
You said I couldn't move to New York and go to The School of Performing Arts because I couldn't move there by myself.
- But now that Hilary's going - Oh, we'll be roommates.
Ashley.
Ashley, calm down.
There's more than that one reason for your not moving to New York.
- Like what?
- Uh l I think you know.
No, I don't.
Come on.
Up in Dad's office, there's a Sunday New York Times.
We can find an apartment from there.
Hey, hey, hey.
Stay out of my office.
You can jump in here any time, Vivian.
Perhaps that iron fist that you rule with has gotten a bit rusty, sir.
Perhaps I should hit something.
Be careful of misguided anger, sir.
I'm gonna go down and have Shatner sign my copy of his new book, Man o' War.
What to wear?
What to wear?
What to wear?
Hil, I gotta let you know, I'm more than a little upset about how you played me with this whole New York thing.
This is a wound that will not quickly heal.
Okay.
Hilary.
I'm Dick West.
- I'm with the network.
- Oh.
We're just pleased as punch to have you aboard, pretty lady.
Oh, thank you.
We're really excited about New York.
Everyone, I'd like you to meet William Shatner.
- How you doing?
Will Smith.
- Nice to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.
Bill, Bill, Bill, I'm Dick West.
I'm with the network.
- Oh.
- I noticed you drove in today.
Thought beaming down would be too flashy, huh?
Good one, Dick.
- Thanks, guy.
Hey, I'll catch you later, huh?
- Oh, yeah.
What is it about these suits that they feel they have to make some lame Star Trek joke when they start off?
- I don't unders - William Shatner.
I saw your car out in the parking lot.
I guess you thought beaming down would be too flashy, huh?
Get it, huh?
That's a good one, Dick.
- Well, actually, his name is Carlton.
- Who cares?
Boy, the Twilight Zones.
The Star Trek episodes.
The movies.
The TekWar books.
T.J. Hooker.
Huh.
How about that Heather Locklear?
Hubba, hubba.
Listen, now, you don't have to shoot anything for the next three hours.
- Anything you wanna do?
- Yeah, get away from this guy.
Look, everybody, I just bought my first winter coat and mittens.
And I got long underwear, wool socks, scarves and earmuffs.
That's great.
It'll keep you nice and warm.
Warm?
It doesn't get that cold in California.
- Daddy, it's for New York.
- Yes, but you're not going to New York.
Ooh.
And I got these great fleece-lined boots.
Oh, these are beautiful.
Ashley, is New York as far away as Disneyland?
Nicky.
Nicky.
Sweetheart, she's not going to New York.
- I know.
Can I come visit you?
- Yes.
- I remember my first visit to New - Vivian.
- Mexico.
Ah.
New Mexico.
Heh.
Nothing like taking a bite of the Big Ap Tostada.
I am not losing both my daughters.
She's my baby girl, Vivian.
Daddy, you're not losing us.
You'll know exactly where we are.
We'll be in New York.
- Let's go see what your sister bought.
- Yeah.
You are not going to New York.
Vivian.
Vi She's not going to New York.
You are not going to New York.
Did you hear?
I'm your fath You're not going to New York.
She's not going to New York.
Oh.
All right.
Best three out of five.
All right, you wanna keep taking this here whooping.
Most people are intimidated by me.
They let me win.
Very funny, Will, giving me the wrong address.
Hello, Mr. William Shatner.
Hey.
All right.
Look, now, you can stay here and you can hang out.
But remember the rules.
All right, I won't talk.
I promise.
And?
And if I feel myself getting overexcited, I take a time out.
All right.
Now go sit down somewhere.
Oh, I don't need a time out.
I don't need a time out.
I'm sorry, Will, I can't help it.
I forgot to ask you this at the studio, but would you please sign this picture?
Just make it out to, "Carlton, my best friend on Earth, bar none".
I can't.
I have this arrangement with the people who do the Star Trek conventions.
I have to charge you $50.
But I don't have $50.
- Would you take a check?
- No.
Try and cash it at the bar.
And while you're there, get me a drink.
Coming right up, Mr. William Shatner.
You know that cousin of yours is really attractive.
Carlton?
- No, no, no.
Not him.
- I mean, he cute but I ain't never really Your cousin Hilary.
Oh.
Oh.
Heh.
Better watch it.
Hilary be taking aerobics and stuff like that.
It might hurt you.
Aerobics.
Ha.
That sounds good.
Well, nope, she's off limits, anyway.
She's taking her show to New York.
I'm out of a job.
She ain't even warn me.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I've been canceled a time or two myself.
Always led to something better.
I mean, remember, as long you've got a job, you do the best job you can.
And look at you, you're a bright guy.
You'll bounce back on your feet.
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
Hey, you wouldn't happen to know anybody, would you?
We move in different circles.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Now sit back down.
Will, I wanna play pool too.
No.
Come on, just one shot.
I wanna be able to say that I shot pool with William Shatner.
Carlton, he doesn't like you.
How could he like you more than me?
You haven't even read any of his books.
- He doesn't care about any of that stuff.
- Well, I do.
Now give me the stick.
- Let go.
Let go.
- Give me the stick.
Oh!

Get a life.
I know a dentist.
We can get you there, have you fixed in time for The Hilary Show.
I'm not doing any show.
This is my mistake.
You can't take this out on my cousin.
I can take it out on anyone I want.
I'm William Shatner.
Will.
Did you sense the power in that man?
Shut up.
- He's in here.
- Oh, great.
Listen, Will, I'm gonna hop in the chair with him.
Take a picture.
Quick.
Carlton.
No.
Would you stop acting stupid?
Hey, Mr. Shatner, look, I'm really sorry that I busted your tooth, man.
But can you please come with us to do my cousin Hilary's show?
Well Look, you know, this is my mistake and I don't want you to take it out on Hilary.
This is really, really important to her.
Oh, man.
Carlton, he all hyped up on that goofy gas.
Man, turn that thing off.
Oh, boy.
- Mm.
- I don't know how to work this thing.
Look, come on.
Come on.
Snap out of it.
"Hangding".
Carlton, he ain't snapping out of it, man.
- I thought this room was empty.
- You was wrong then, wasn't you, brother?
All right, this what we gonna do.
I'm gonna pick him up.
I'm gonna put him over my shoulder, carry him out.
But you go out there first.
I need you to stay there.
Make sure that the coast is clear  Carlton?
Carlton, what is the ma?
What is the matter with you, man?

Oh!
Whoa!
Spock, is that you?
Your ears are the same but something's different.
Uhura.
Hey, open up the hailing frequency.
Captain, the dilithium crystals are almost gone.
The matter/antimatter reactors are failing.
Scotty, you're black.
The bridge, it's changed.
Spasers on spun.
Oh, my tooth.
Bones, fix it.
Damn it, Jim.
I'm a black boy from Philly, not a doctor.
Will, where have you been?
And where is Mr. Shatner?
He went Oh.

Where you at, boy?
Here I go, dog.
Here you go, brother.
Throw your hands in the air If you's a true player  This guy kills me.
He's killing me.
Will what did you do to him?
- Nothing.
Hey, Werner, I just wanna say I love you, man.
Sulu, where you been?
And why are you out of uniform?
I never liked that guy.
Mr. Shatner, look, I don't know what it is that this man has done to you.
But whatever it is, I apologize and I hope we can just work it out without any legal action.
What you talking about?
This guy loves us, right?
Absolutely.
I'll see you in court.
Everybody, rumba.
- Rumba.
- Rumba.
- Thirty seconds for Mr. Shatner.
- Mr. Shatner is not quite ready for air.
What do you mean not ready?
Do you know who you're talking to?
That's right, boy.
You better recognize.
Mr. Shatner, I didn't mean No, no.
You better not had meant, I know you ain't mean.
Smarten up, Opie.
I may be in an altered state right now but when those cameras are on me and those lights hit me, I'll be 100 percent dope.
- Oh!
- That's right, homey.
It's all good.
It's all good.
It's all good.
Works for me.
Let's get him on the stage.
Okay, posse, this way.
- No, no, no.
- What do you mean "no, no, no"?
This way.
This way.
This way.
Hello, and welcome to Hilary.
Please give a warm Hilary welcome to actor, director and author of this new and exciting book, Man o' War, William Shatner.
William Shatner, what would you like to talk about?
Girl, you a bad mamma jamma.
I know.
Oh, that goofy gas gave me such a headache.
Oh, look, I just wanna apologize for everything that I put you through.
The least I could've done was let you beat me at pool.
Whoa, wait a minute.
Beat me at pool.
You never beat me at pool.
Oh, Bill, Bill, Bill.
I see you still got your buzz on a little bit, huh?
Listen, I can beat you at pool anytime, any place, any planet.
Don't let your mouth write a check your pool stick can't cash.
- That sounds like a challenge.
- Yes.
Well, put your hand there.
- You call me sometime.
- All right.
Okay.
And captain live long and prosper.
Hey, what about my autograph?
Oh, look.
This one's on the Upper East Side.
Oh, the shopping there is unbelievable.
This is the happiest I've ever been.

Sweetheart, I've been doing a lot of thinking and there's no reason for you to be so down.
I've decided Are you ready for this?

He liked me more.

He did like me more.
He did.
Okay.
Y'all was like brothers and I was really jealous.
Now, doesn't the truth make you feel better?
Will, I know that the show's moving to New York came as kind of a surprise to you  but I just wanna let you know that if you ever change your mind there'll always be a place for you at The Hilary Show.
Hey, well, thanks a lot, Hil.
You know, but you don't have to worry about me, you know.
Because by then, you know, I'll probably have my own show.
Yeah.
You know, because I might be unemployed now but I'm the type of brother you can't keep down.
Okay.
You know, because in the face of adversity you know, that's when Will Smith, you know, really shines.
You know, that's You know, because I'm at my best.
Adversity put me in all my glory.
Adversification, but You know, it's really good to see how much this family cares about what we think and feel.
It sure is.
I mean, you should have seen how Ashley felt about what I thought.

You should have saw how Hilary was acting about, you know, my future.
She was worried.

- Happy birthday dear Uncle Phil - Happy birthday dear Daddy Happy birthday to you Whoo!
You better watch it, boy.
Mess around, blow that whole cake on the floor.
Uncle Phil, come on now.
How would you describe the look on your face when we screamed "surprise"?
Uh Surprised?
Man, you looked just like a cow caught in the headlights.
The correct term is "deer caught in the headlights".
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know.
Forty-eight, 49, a jillion.
- Mom, how old are you?
- Hmm?
Younger than your father.
- But everything's younger than Dad.
- Yeah.
Such a kidder.
Ha-ha-ha.
But 50's gonna be a great year.
Not only for me, but for all of us.
I got a son heading off to Princeton.
Two daughters starting exciting lives in New York.
Another son starting kindergarten.
And a nephew that's, uh That's, uh Hey, buddy, you're gonna love kindergarten.
Well, it looks like we're all in the fast lane.
Except for Will.
I mean, someone has to be stuck on the soft shoulder.
Y'all hear what he said?
Stuck on the soft shoulder.
Hey, are all the other munchkins as funny as you?
- Champagne.
- Oh.
Great, I love champagne.
I mean, I love the look of it.
The color and the bubbles.
Well, here's to my wonderful family.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
I have a little announcement to make myself.
I have decided to move back to London to be near my son Frederick.
- Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey?
Well, I thought about it long and hard.
The time is right.
He needs me.
- Good luck, Geoffrey.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
Oh, Geoffrey, I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, we have to have a special going-away dinner for you.
What do you wanna make?
Let's have another toast.
To all of us going on with our new lives.
And Will.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
Don't worry, Will, you can come to kindergarten with me.
Waa, pssh.
Geoffrey, I know it's a little premature and I know I really didn't have to but being the generous person that I am, I got you a little going-away gift.
And that's a real autograph.
Go ahead, press the button.
Press the button.
HILARY : Geoffrey, get in here, I need you.
Oh, don't you just love it?
Love it.
Hey, hey, morning, Uncle Phil.
Whoa, 50 and a day, man.
How's it feel?
I'm not getting older, I'm just getting better.
That's the same thing I'd say if I was on the downside of the hill.
Before I go to Princeton, there's a few loose ends I'd like to tie up.
I've taken the liberty of re-drafting your will.
Now, if you'll sign right here and initial this little box in the event you lapse into a coma, that'll give us the right to pull the plug.
How about a little sensitivity?
All right, but if he keels over today, we're screwed.
Morning, all.
Isn't it a great day?
Pssh!
Happy birthday, Mr. Banks.
Heard you had quite a soiree last night.
That's French for "shindig".
What's French for "unwelcomed guest"?
I bought this for you.
They're false teeth.
They were my grandmom's.
She don't need them no more.
I know that look.
You're not getting any younger.
This isn't good for your back.
I brought this on myself.
Aah!
Man, Uncle Phil, you beat your own record by, like, 10 feet.
Yeah.
There he is.
The oldest man in the world.
Ahh!
- I still got it.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Ah.
I've been thinking, with you going back to England there's going to be a big void in my life.
Master Carlton, we'll write.
But that won't get my dry cleaning picked up.
Chop-chop, Geoffrey.
And to think I fished that boy out of the pool.
Okay.
I got the color swatches.
This is gonna be so much fun, living together.
I know, I can't wait.
Okay.
Ahem.
Eggshell in the kitchen and taupe in the living room.
I don't think so.
We agreed I could pick out the colors.
We agreed that you would have input.
That's right, and I'm inputting these colors into our apartment.
My apartment.
And I just changed my mind, you'll have no input whatsoever.
This is gonna be so much fun, us living together.
I'm gonna miss this time we've spend together.
Me working hard, focusing on my career and you sitting around in the house all day in your robe playing Nintendo.
You always make me feel so, so superior.
Like the story of the grasshopper and the ant.
The ant worked all summer long storing up food while the grasshopper frittered away his time.
Well, the winter has come and you've just been frittering.
Frittering.
Frittering.
Frittering.
See, now, that's where you're wrong.
See, the grasshopper hasn't been frittering.
Unlike the ant, the grasshopper had a life and friends.
And once in a while, a couple of little ladybugs would come over to spend some time with the grasshopper.
And on one weekend You know the ladybug from the bookstore, the one the ant has the crush on?
She even came over to spend some time with that fine grasshopper.
The weekend he was away at Princeton.
Well, what was she doing here?
Frittering.
Mm.
She fritters so good.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's funny.
You're the funniest guy in the pool house.
And soon enough, you're gonna be the only guy in the pool house.
With the rest of us striking out on our own the only question is, who's gonna move out first, you or Nicky?
Ha, ha.
Better hope he doesn't go to boarding school.
Hey, G. What's up, man?
Hey, look, I got this friend, right?
He kind of got a little problem.
See, he got these three cousins and they're all moving on with new and exciting lives and everything.
Is your friend feeling pensive?
My friend doesn't know what pensive means.
Is your friend feeling lost?
Ah!
Lost.
Yeah, yeah.
See, he's feeling lost.
You know, he's feeling like the world is just rushing by him, you know.
Everybody's getting into all these new things and he's just stuck kicking it in the pool house.
Well, I mean, you know, per se.
You know, I mean, I guess he's feeling embarrassed you know, that he's the only one that ain't doing nothing.
Well, then I suggest you tell your friend the story my father told me.
It's the tale of the young Earl of Monroe who wanted to build a bridge over the River Mersey.
He labored for years and years and finally he was all done and quite proud of himself.
Okay.
Okay.
So I guess what you're saying is I should just tell my boy that if he applies himself, everything gonna be cool.
Well, actually, when the earl completed the bridge, he flung himself off it.
- Dude killed himself?
- Quite.
Now, if you'll excuse me, Master William, I have dinner to prepare.
That's the advice that your father gave you?
My father was not a well man.
Geoffrey, we are really gonna miss your cooking.
Oh, not to mention your cleaning.
I'll never find anyone who can iron the way you do.
Don't even go there.
You know, Will, with Geoffrey leaving, there's a job opening here in the house.
Yeah, I guess I could start by washing your pants in a thimble.
You know, this is one of the last times that we'll all be sitting together around this table for a while.
We should cherish these few moments we have as a family.
I'm really gonna miss you guys.
Oh, not to worry, Big Guy.
Will's gonna be sitting around this table for years to come.
Leave Will alone.
He can stay in the pool house for as long as he wants.
- Right, Daddy?
- Well It's either that or the Homeboy Homeless Shelter.
Ha!
For your information, midget boy, I already got an apartment.
You did?
Well, yeah.
You know, I was gonna surprise y'all, you know, but You're moving?
- Yeah, I'm moving.
- Don't toy with my emotions, Will.
I've been waiting a long time, I'm very vulnerable.
Look, I said, I'm moving, Uncle Phil.
The pool house is mine.
Yes.
Oh, it's you.
Circling apartments, eh?
Looks like you've painted yourself into a corner this time, Master William.
Well, don't you worry about me.
I'm one of the best corner-getter-outers that there is.
You'll see.
But I'm saying, you know I mean, you do got my back, right?
Within a week, I shall be at 30,000 feet headed to London with many tiny bottles of Jim Beam dancing in front of me.
But until then your back is mine.
Thanks a lot, G. - Good morning, Will.
- Hey, what's up, Uncle Phil?
I hope you didn't misconstrue my enthusiasm over your leaving, last night.
I'm really proud of you.
Heh, heh.
In fact, I'm even a little envious.
I mean, there's nothing more exciting than change.
You know, I have a little story I'd like to tell you.
When did the story fairy descend on this house?
Look, Uncle Phil, can we do that later?
You know, I gotta go check out a few things for my spot.
Oh, well, sure.
Sure.
What do you want?
Um I'm here to see the apartment.
Fine.
Don't touch that channel!
It's one bedroom with a bath.
One parking space.
No loud music That cupcake's mine!
I'm sorry.
You have company?
No.
I just thought somebody was there, you know, because No.
I'm alone.
Did you ever see that movie One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?
Oh, I suppose I have to clean that up.
Hold on.
Sir, I have the airline on the phone.
In lieu of my spring bonus, I think it would be a magnificent gesture if you sent me back to London first class on the Concorde.
What would you consider an adequate gesture?
Business class with a kosher meal.
What would be less than adequate?
Working here another year.
I'll get back to you.
Ah.
There you are.
Sit down, we need to have a little talk.
Will did it.
No one did anything.
Now sit down.
Well, your mother and I have decided since all of you are moving out that, well, we all need to be clear on a few things.
We expect you to behave yourselves just as you do at home.
The same rules apply.
Then what's the point of moving?
Can I have that one back?
I don't know that these rules apply, I'm 25.
Hilary, you're 27.
That doesn't leave this room.
I'm gonna need you to look in on your sisters on the weekend.
Oh, great.
Now I can kiss Glee Club goodbye.
Okay, are we done?
I'd like to go over the schedule.
We're gonna get together on all major holidays.
Thanksgiving Oh, no, Dad.
November's sweeps month.
No can do.
We're gonna get together for Christmas.
What if I meet somebody and they invite me to their house?
Well, what if I meet somebody?
Well, what if she meets somebody?
Dad, why don't we just see what happens?
No, we are not just gonna see what happens.
We're gonna get together whether we want to or not because we're a family and we love each other, right?
- Yeah.
- Now get out.
Okay.
Now, out this window, you get a ocean view.
The sunsets here are fabulous.
Oh, man, I gotta tell you, this place is all that.
And the price isn't too much because, well, I am flexible.
Man, this is less than what I'm paying now, Mr. Clark.
- No, call me Peter, huh?
- Oh, cool.
Peter.
Hey, so when you moving out?
I'm not moving out.
Geoffrey, I'm gonna need some things taken care of in the pool house before I move in.
Master Nicky, I do sympathize with your plight but I leave in a matter of days.
That's plenty of time to paint.
Chop-chop.
Master William, any luck with your search?
Man, I saw some of the nastiest places this city has to offer.
Oh, well.
You'll have better luck tomorrow.
Suppose you right if I was gonna keep looking.
G, what would you say if I said I think I may have made a mistake?
The word "duh" comes to mind.
Well, you know what?
I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil and just tell him I lied.
I mean, I'm a man, you know.
I can admit to my mistakes.
That's all it was, a mistake.
Mistakes can be undone.
You learn, you move on.
So what?
I can admit I was completely wrong and I can take my lumps.
Lumps I earned.
A man's lumps.
Uncle Phil can relate to that.
He a man, he lumpy.
- Well said.
- I'm gonna march right up to Uncle Phil and I'm gonna say, "This man is staying in the pool house".
Good show, Master William.
And I wouldn't miss it for the world.
- What does he want now?
- Who knows?
Everyone, glad you're here.
Your mother and I have an announcement to make.
Dad, we've already been through this.
We'll give you Columbus Day.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I have an announcement to make too.
Will, you wanna go first?
- No, you can go ahead, Uncle Phil.
Ah.
Thank you.
In light of all the changes afoot, your mother and I have decided to change too.
We're gonna sell the house.
- You're really selling the house?
- Yeah.
What do you think?
What are you, crazy?
I mean that in the most respectful way.
I know what this is.
I did an entire show on it.
"The change of life".
Are you experiencing mood swings?
Trouble sleeping?
Do your breasts ache?
I am not going through menopause.
Mood swing at 3 o'clock.
Your father and I decided that since all of you were moving out we don't need a house this big anymore.
Oh, whoa, whoa.
Hold on.
I mean, do we really wanna sell this house in a soft market?
Oh, yeah.
It's soft, Uncle Phil.
Marshmallowy.
I am selling this house for a lot more than I paid for it.
Then let's dump this puppy.
Excuse me, I love this house.
I grew up in this house.
Yeah, she grew up in this house, and Carlton still has a lot of growing to do.
Where would we go for the holidays?
Wait, whatever happened to November sweeps, huh?
- Well, it - Ashley, "I might meet somebody"?
And Ashley, "I might meet somebody"?
Dad, we'll come home for the holidays.
See, they wanna come home for the holidays.
No, you kids were right.
We're not gonna be spending a lot of time together so there's no reason why we can't move back East.
We wanna be close to you guys.
Well, why just be close?
Let's all live together.
No.
Did I say that?
It's gonna be great.
Oh, Will, we were so caught up in our own excitement, we forgot about your news.
Well, what do you wanna tell us?
Oh.
Um I bought a monkey.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
On the last Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: This is one of the last times that we'll all be sitting together around this table for a while.
We should cherish these few moments we have as a family.
Oh.
Not to worry, Big Guy.
Will's gonna be sitting around this table for years to come.
For your information, midget boy, I already got an apartment.
I have, uh, a little announcement to make myself.
I have decided to move back to London to be near my son Frederick.
What would you say if I said I think I may have made a mistake?
The word "duh" comes to mind.
In light of all the changes afoot your mother and I have decided to change too.
We're gonna sell the house.
Come on, Will.
Early bird catches the worm.
Sound like that's what got caught in your throat.
So, Will, you haven't told me about your new place.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, you know, I'm moving in soon.
You know, right now they putting a Jacuzzi in and they getting the mirrors on the roof.
So what, it's kind of a fixer-upper?
Oh, no, no.
No, not at all, man.
Yo, this place is huge.
I mean, we got floor-to-ceiling walls and wall-to-wall floors.
Man, yo, it's the bomb.
Look, since Mom and Dad are selling the place I don't wanna take all my stuff to Princeton.
Can I leave some of it in your apartment?
Pfft.
Ooh, uh No, I can't do that.
See, uh, my place kind of small, man.
I thought you just said it was big.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
No.
I mean, uh, it's big in a real petite kind of way.
Ah.
I know what this is.
- You do?
- Separation anxiety.
You can't bear to have reminders of me in your new place.
Oh, come here, you big lug.
Will, don't hide your emotions.
Look, Carlton, I don't have no separation anxiety.
I got no-apartment anxiety.
Oh, someone's hiding their true feelings.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Carlton, stop.
Carlton, stop.
I don't have an apartment.
What?
Yeah.
I never had one.
Why'd you lie?
I don't know, man.
Y'all was all going on with your stuff.
Look, I just did.
Whatever.
Look, Will, I'm sorry.
When I gave you a hard time earlier about frittering I didn't mean anything by it.
Yeah, I know.
It's just that you was right.
Look, Will, why don't you move back East with us?
You could transfer to a school in New York.
You could take the job on the Hilary Show, you could be near the family.
Come on, just make it easy on yourself.
Carlton, I don't wanna make it easy on myself.
I came out here to go to school and that's what I'm gonna do.
Period.
I started it and I'm gonna finish it.
Look, I just need to get myself situated.
So, what are you gonna do?
Gotta get out there and look for a place.
You know what?
Dad could help you out in a minute.
- I'm gonna go - Carlton, no.
Carlton.
No, I don't want Uncle Phil to know nothing about this.
Why?
That's dumb.
Carlton, I do not need Uncle Phil to clean up all my messes.
No.
You are gonna swear to me right now, you ain't gonna say nothing to nobody.
Okay, Will.
I swear.
Hello, Master William, you're back early.
How's the apartment hunt going?
Pfft.
Please, don't ask.
Where's everybody at?
They're gone.
We're showing the house today, remember?
Oh, right.
What are you still doing here?
That's a question that haunts me every day.
Actually, I'm here to answer questions about the house.
That is not your job.
There they go abusing you again.
I mean, I love them but it hurts me so bad the way they treat you.
G, you go ahead get out of here, man.
I'll take care of it.
You will do your best?
What would make me happier than selling the house?
Not selling the house?
Yep.
You know, this looks like a great place, Arnold.
- Yeah, Willis would love it.
- Yeah.
Yeah, that is if he wouldn't mind living over a haunted Indian burial ground.
Who are you?
Hey, I'm Will Smith.
I'm the Realto.
At night, you can hear the wailing of the dead.
What you talking about, Will?
I think he's overstating it a little bit, Arnold.
You're probably right, Dad.
Let's check out this fly pad.
I could get used to living in the lap of luxury.
You know, those things were a lot funnier when you were still a little child.
Yeah, well, Dad, your little stories were a lot more interesting back then too.
Hey, let's check out the wet bar.
Oh, wait, wait.
Uh, we don't have one.
Let's check out the house down the street.
Thanks anyway.
Yes.
And this is the living room.
Come on, shake a leg.
We gotta get to the Universal Tour and see the Backdraft ride.
Oh, then you should probably leave now before the fire goes out.
Oh, believe me, Will.
The fire went out a long time ago.
Oh, George, this place is beautiful.
I'm telling you, Weezy, we can't afford it.
How can you say that?
Easy.
He's cheap.
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.
Out here, there are a lot of people crossing the border to get a job like yours.
One look at a bald-headed miser like you, they'll be crossing right back over.
I'm telling you, Weezy, it's too expensive.
Oh, loosen up, George.
I like it.
Oh, yeah, and let me tell you.
Next door, ooh, the girls, man.
Bikinis all that.
They got a regular Playboy mansion jumping off over there.
Memorial Day, it all comes off, you know what I'm talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about, boy?
- Ha, ha!
Come on, George.
This place is too expensive.
- It all comes off, huh?
- Man, let me tell you George!
- Hey, hey, what's up, y'all?
- Hey, Will.
Sir, it's the Realto.
Now, don't get your hopes up, Uncle Phil.
I mean, it could take weeks or months, even years to sell a house.
Yeah?
Great.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
- We have a buyer.
What?
- That's fantastic.
- A couple.
The Jeffersons.
There's only one catch.
We have to be out in a week.
Why such a rush?
Something about being in by Memorial Day and it all coming off.
We can't possibly be out in seven days.
I mean, we have to organize, we have to pack, we have to move.
I mean, Geoffrey only has two hands.
Our apartment's not even ready.
Where are we gonna live?
And my dorm room's not ready.
And what about Will?
Oh, Will's set, huh?
I have an idea.
Why don't we check into the Plaza Hotel?
Or perhaps the Hilton.
Ha, ha.
Good one, Daddy.
All right, all right, we'll stay at the Plaza.
Let's crack open a bottle of champagne.
- Ooh, champagne.
- Girl.
So, Will, what are you gonna do?
Hey, hey, hey, no need to stress, C. I mean, I still got seven days.
God built the whole universe in that much time.
He had better credit.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
No, no.
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
I mean, I know I don't have any references and I don't have any credit, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it?
Oh, it is?
Ha, ha.
Well Get the Ha, ha Hello?
Hello?
I cannot believe it's that hard to rent an apartment.
Yes, to think that all landlords wouldn't jump at the chance to rent to somebody with no job, no references, no credit.
It's because I'm black, ain't it?
Hey, Will.
How's your apartment?
Is everything set up?
Oh, yeah.
It's cool, Uncle Phil.
Thanks.
All set.
- Okay.
- I haven't seen it.
Has anyone?
Oh, well, from When I took the, um Yeah, yeah.
I have.
Oh, what does it look like?
Well, it's wall-to-wall doors and floor-to-ceiling floors.
It's neat.
It makes this place look tiny.
Ha, ha.
Ahem.
You know, I think Carlton's just bragging a little too much.
- I wanna see it.
- We'd all like to see it.
Um, well, you can't.
Because it's tented.
Look, C No, you can't because I don't have an apartment.
It's a condo is what it is.
Look, that's all right.
That's all right, C. Um, I don't have an apartment and I never had one.
Would you excuse us for a minute, please?
I'm sorry, Will.
What the hell is going on?
Look, um, Uncle Phil, this is not really your concern.
You know, it's about me, it's not about you.
- So don't even worry about it, all right?
- How can you say that?
We are leaving town in a day and you don't have a place to live.
Why did you lie?
I mean, we sitting around the table and everybody talking about all these great lives and these new things they're doing.
I didn't want you to say: "Hey, there's my nephew.
Yeah, he's still living in my pool house".
I didn't want you to think that all these years that I've been out here just ain't worth nothing.
You know, that you just been wasting your time with me.
Look, Uncle Phil, I just don't want you to think that I'm that same stupid kid I was when I first moved out here.
How could you possibly believe that that's what I'd be thinking?
Look at you.
You're moving out on your own.
You're gonna finish college in a year.
You're becoming a man.
A man I'm damn proud of.
I just didn't want your last memory of me to be no better than the first one.
You have no idea what my first memory of you is.
I remember a kid loaded with all the potential in the world.
And now I see a person on the verge of realizing that potential.
Come on, let's go get you an apartment.
Hey, Uncle Phil, um what you mean by verge?
- Don't push your luck.
Oh, wait, check this out.
I didn't know I had two Biggie Smalls CDs.
Oh.
One of them is mine.
You own a Biggie Smalls CD?

Wait a minute.
I know I don't own two What's New Pussycats?

Childhood to manhood.
It's been a good trip.

Sounds great, man.
You know what?
What are you doing?
Oh, no, no.
You got to do it.
One last time for me, man.
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone It's not unusual to have fun with anyone But when I see you hanging about With anyone It's not unusual to see me cry I wanna die It's not unusual to go out at any time But when I see you out and about It's such a crime If you should ever wanna Be loved by anyone It's not unusual It happens every day No matter what you say  Wow, it's so empty.
It's kind of creepy.
Uh, maybe you kids should take another look around before the car comes.
All right.
- Lot of good times in this house, huh?
- A lifetime's worth.
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
No, no.
I'm cool.
I'm cool, Uncle Phil.
You know, it's just when I first came out here, you know I was a relative.
But for the past six years, it's like we've been family.
I just don't wanna go back to being just a relative again.
I mean, I lived without a father and without brothers and sisters and all of that.
I like this life better.
I want you to call me on Sundays too when you're calling all your other kids.
Look, um I love you, Uncle Phil, and I just don't wanna lose you, you know, any of you.
You're not gonna lose us.
You are my son, Will.
