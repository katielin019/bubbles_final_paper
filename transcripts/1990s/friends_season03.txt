{START OF EPISODE 1}
-She totally winked at me!
-She did not wink at you.
You always think somebody's winking at you.
The One With the Princess Leia Fantasy .
:staz:.
I say "Tupelo Honey" by van Morrison.
No way!
The most romantic song ever was "The Way We Were.
" I think the one that Elton John wrote for that guy on Who's the Boss?
What song was that?
Hold me close Young Tony Danza -Hi, Monica.
-Hi, Mon.
Oh, my God!
Has she slept at all?
It's been three nights in a row.
She finally stopped crying yesterday.
But then she found one of Richard's cigar butts on the terrace.
.
.
.
Okay, that explains it.
I got a call at 2 in the morning.
.
.
.
.
.
and all I could hear was this squeaky sound.
So I thought, "It's a mouse or a possum.
" Then I realized, like, okay.
.
.
.
.
.
where would a mouse or a possum get the money to make the phone call?
-Morning.
-Morning.
You made pancakes?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
Monica and Rachel had syrup Now I can get my man to cheer up Good morning, Joey.
Good morning.
Why don't you stay home from work and just hang out with me?
Oh, I wish.
You have that report to finish, and I've got to see my lawyer.
I can't believe I date a girl who's getting divorced.
I' m such a grownup.
I gotta go, I gotta go.
Not without a kiss.
Maybe I won't kiss you so you'll stay.
Kiss her.
Kiss her!
I'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.
Bye-bye, Janice.
When are you dumping her?
Nope.
Not this time.
Come on, quit yanking me.
I' m not yanking you.
-This is Janice.
-Yeah, I know.
She makes me happy.
You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking.
.
.
.
.
.
that you' re not breaking up with her.
No blinking.
I' m not breaking up with her!
God, look what I found in the drain!
What?
It's some of Richard's hair!
What do I do with this?
Getting it away from me would be job one.
It's weird, but I don't want to throw this away.
This is all I have left of him.
Gross.
.
.
.
.
.
drain hair.
Cool!
It looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
-What is wrong with me?
-You need to get some sleep.
I need to get some Richard.
You broke up with him for a reason.
I know.
I know.
I' m just so tired of missing him.
Tired of wondering why he hasn't called.
Why hasn't he?
Maybe because you told him not to?
What are you, the Memory Woman?
They' re not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?
They' re not breaking up!
He didn't blink!
I' m not surprised.
Have you seen them together?
They' re really cute.
"Cute"?
This is Janice!
You remember Janice?
Yes, I remember.
She's annoying.
But you know what?
She's his girlfriend now.
I mean, what can we do?
There you go!
That's the spirit I' m looking for!
"What can we do"?
All right, who's first, huh?
Ross?
Chandler's our friend, and Janice makes him happy.
So I say we be adult about it and accept her.
We'll call that Plan B. Honey.
.
.
.
.
.
I was wondering.
.
.
.
.
.
do you still have that Navy uniform?
No, I had to return it to the costume place.
I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?
Well, honey, what about you?
Do you have any fun, you know, fantasy-type things?
Come on.
You gotta have one.
Nope.
You know what?
If you tell me, I might do it.
Did you ever see Return of the Jedi?
.
Do you remember the scene.
.
.
.
.
.
with Jabba the Hutt?
Well, Jabba had as his prisoner.
.
.
.
.
.
Princess Leia.
Princess Leia was wearing.
.
.
.
.
.
this gold bikini thing.
It was pretty cool.
Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Every guy our age loved that.
Really?
It's huge!
That's the moment when she stopped being a princess.
.
.
.
.
.
and she became, like, you know, a woman.
Did you ever do the Leia thing?
Really?
That great, huh?
No, it's just that I got this new pager, and I have it on "vibrate.
" See you.
Hi, you guys!
Look who I found standing outside the Szechuan Dragon.
.
.
.
.
.
staring at a parking meter.
-Why aren't you at work?
-Oh, they sent me home.
Why?
Because I don't work at the Szechuan Dragon.
You really need to get some sleep.
I know I do.
Guess what?
They published my paper.
Really?
Let me see, let me see!
Rach, look!
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me?
There he is!
-Wheel!
-Of!
Fortune!
This guy's so stupid.
It's Count Rushmore!
You should really go on this show.
I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight.
What do you say?
I say I am there!
Cool!
Is Ross going too?
No.
Janice.
Janice?
Because I just feel bad for Ross, you know?
We always go together.
We' re like The Three Hockey-teers, you know?
I may be way out on a limb here, but do you have a problem with Janice?
No!
Yes.
.
.
.
Oh, God, how do I say this?
You know that girl from the restaurant with the hair?
That girl that I hate?
She drives me crazy.
Look, I don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?
Well, there you go.
Don't look at me like that.
She drove you nuts before, remember?
I' m crazy about her now.
This could be the real thing.
Capital R, capital T!
Don't worry, those are the right letters.
Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!
I can't.
It's like a chemical thing.
Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna.
.
.
.
.
.
pull my arm off so I have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying.
Oh, and by the way, there is no Count Rushmore!
Then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you tell her?
I didn't think it would be that big a deal!
She didn't think it would be that big a deal!
Who are you talking to when you do that?
Look, that was supposed to be a private, personal thing between us.
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.
Guys do the same thing.
I mean, what about all that locker-room stuff?
That's different.
That's like, who dated a stripper?
Or who did it on the back of the Staten lsland ferry?
Both of those Joey?
But you don't talk about your girlfriend.
.
.
.
.
.
and the intimate stuff you do with her.
Not even with your best friend?
That is so sad.
You' re missing out on so much.
I mean, the bonding and the sharing.
.
.
.
.
.
and knowing they' re going through the same thing you are.
So, what, you tell each other everything?
Pretty much.
Did you talk about the Night of Five Times?
Do you tell people about the Night of Five Times?
Honey, that was with Carol.
I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
Relax every muscle in your body.
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.
Okay, now close your eyes.
.
.
.
.
.
and think of a happy place.
Tell me your happy place.
Richard's living room, drinking wine.
No, no, no.
Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.
I' m sorry, but that's my happy place.
Okay, fine.
Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.
I'll try not to.
Okay.
All right, so, you' re in a meadow.
.
.
.
.
.
millions of stars in the sky-- You think breaking up was a mistake?
There are no questions in the happy place.
Just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees.
I'll bet he's over me.
I'll bet he's fine.
Betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place.
There's just, you know, the lovely waterfalls.
.
.
.
.
.
and the trickling fountains.
.
.
.
.
.
and the calming sounds of the babbling brook.
Okay, this isn't working.
I' m still awake, and now I have to pee.
So I hear.
.
.
.
.
.
you hate me!
I never said hate.
I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me you wanted to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
And you got "hate" from that?
You' re taking a big leap there.
All right, fine, fine, fine!
We have got to do something about our little situation here.
So this is my idea.
You and me spending some quality time together.
But what does that-- For Chandler!
Okay.
I' m in.
Okay!
This is what we'll call it: Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!
A whole day?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
Yeah, I know.
I sleep in the next room.
So I went down to the post office.
.
.
.
.
.
and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered.
.
.
.
.
.
for Richard about the Civil War.
He loved the Civil War.
Do you want us to take you home?
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
Women tell each other everything!
Did you know that?
No, Chandler, everything.
Like stuff you like.
Stuff she likes.
Technique.
Stamina.
Girth.
Girth?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why would they do this?
Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly.
.
.
.
.
.
we ought to be doing it.
Do you want to?
We' re not gonna talk about girth, are we?
All right, you go first.
Okay.
Okay, I'll go first.
So the other night.
.
.
.
.
.
Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies.
.
.
.
.
.
and I happened to describe a particular.
.
.
Star Wars thing-- Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
I know!
Well, that was easy.
Okay, you go.
Okay, you know when you' re in bed with a woman.
.
.
.
.
.
fooling around.
.
.
.
.
.
and you get all these mental images in your brain?
Like Elle MacPherson or the girl at the Xerox place?
-With the bellybutton ring?
-I know.
And then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.
And you' re, like, "Mom, get out of here!
" But after that, you can't think of anything else.
And you can't stop what you' re doing.
So it's kind of like you' re.
.
.
.
.
.
you know.
.
.
.
.
.
you know.
.
.
.
You don't know!
Your mom?
You' re telling me about your mom?
What's the matter with you?
-You said-- -I said "share," not "scare" !
Go sit over there!
We' re back!
What are you guys doing together?
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!
Really?
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.
And, you know, I love this woman.
You have got competition, buddy.
Well, I just came by to give you a kiss.
I have to go pick up the baby.
So, I'll see you later, sweetheart.
You too, Chandler.
-You still can't stand her, can you?
-I' m sorry, I tried!
I really did!
I appreciate you giving it a shot.
But you know, the good thing.
.
.
.
.
.
is that we spent the whole day together and I survived.
And what's even more amazing, so did she.
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
I guess that's something.
Oh, man, that's huge!
Now I know I can stand to be around her.
Which means.
.
.
.
.
.
I get to hang out with you.
Which is kind of the whole point anyway.
Oh, hey!
We stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
Oh, God.
If it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
-Really?
-Oh, yeah!
I always picture your mom when I' m having sex.
April 12, 1861.
The United States garrison at Fort Sumter was fired upon.
It is now under bombardment by-- Dad!
What are you doing?
It's your mother's bridge night, so I came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.
Since when did you start smoking cigars?
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.
So what are you really doing here?
I just wanted to make sure you' re okay.
Why wouldn't I be okay?
I saw Richard.
So how you doing?
I' m fine.
I' m just a little tired, but I' m okay.
-How's Richard doing?
-You don't want to know.
No, I really, really do.
Well, he's doing terrible!
Really?
Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
-You' re not just saying that, are you?
-No, the man is a mess!
Was he crying?
Do you think he was waiting till after you left, so he could cry?
Maybe.
I think so.
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.
You know, after we graduated from college, we broke up for a while.
It seems her father, your grandfather.
.
.
.
.
.
wanted her to travel around Europe like he did.
Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel.
.
.
.
.
.
because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time.
However.
.
.
.
Okay, here we go.
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you.
.
.
.
.
.
have a really weird look on your face.
What?
Honey, what is it?
Did I get the hair wrong?
Or what?
Did you just picture it differently?
What?
It's not you.
It's.
.
.
.
What is it?
Come on, sweetie.
You' re, like, freaking me out here.
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
All right, they got water, orange juice.
.
.
.
.
.
and what looks like cider.
Taste it.
Yeah, it's fat.
I drank fat!
I know, I did that two minutes ago.
Hey, Mr. Tux.
-Why aren't you dressed?
-We have a half-hour.
That was four minutes ago.
We have to be out the door at 7:40.
Relax, we'll be ready.
It takes us two minutes to get dressed.
I'd feel better if you got dressed now.
-Okay.
-Okay.
Oh, look at you.
All sexy.
Really?
-How come you didn't come over earlier?
-Because I' m a stupid, stupid man.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?
No.
So you' re pretty close, huh?
Makeup's on.
Hair's done.
I just have to get dressed.
And that takes, what?
Just 6 or 7 minutes?
Yeah.
Once I figure out what I' m wearing.
Glass of fat?
The One Where No One's Ready .
:staz:.
What's the matter?
You nervous about your speech?
Nope.
-You wanna hear it?
-Am I in it?
After I thank everyone for donating to the museum.
.
.
.
.
.
I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Hello!
You look great!
Thank you.
I know, though.
You see this?
This is a person who is ready to go.
Phoebe, you.
.
.
.
You are my star.
Well, you' re my lucky penny.
All right, I took the quiz.
And it turns out I do put career before men.
Get up.
What?
-You' re in my seat.
-How is this your seat?
I was sitting there.
But then you left.
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.
I went to the bathroom.
You knew I'd be back.
What's the big deal?
Sit somewhere else!
The "big deal" is I was sitting there last!
So.
.
.
.
.
.
it's my seat.
Well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so.
.
.
.
You guys, you know what?
It doesn't matter.
You both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.
I just have to do one thing.
It's not a big deal.
Get up!
Phoebe, you look great!
All right already.
Are you gonna do magic?
That's funny.
Change.
-Hang on, I just got in.
-I don't care.
It starts at 8.
We can't be late.
"He could not, would not, want to wait.
" Our table is down in front.
My boss will be there.
Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
Has somebody been drinking my fat?
Does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?
I don't know.
You might be the first one.
-Rach, did you check the machine?
-No.
Wait.
This is the outfit that makes my calves look fat.
Never mind.
Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.
It's called, "Get up!
" All right.
You can have the chair.
-Really?
-Oh, my.
Would you look at that?
It's me, I'm coming over.
What if I'm already there when you play this message?
Is that too spooky?
Hi, Rach, are you there?
It's me.
Pick up.
Rachel?
Rach?
What?
Never mind.
Monica, it's Richard.
Call me.
Is that message old or new?
Old or new?
Old or new?
It's definitely old.
Didn't you hear the double beep?
What if it's new?
We agreed not to talk.
It could be important.
Shouldn't I call him back?
Honey, you did call him back.
It's old.
Yeah, see, Mon, listen.
Listen.
When Carol and I broke up.
.
.
.
.
.
I went through the same thing.
You know what I did?
I got dressed.
Really, really quickly, okay?
Okay?
There we go.
There we go.
You know what?
Don't get up.
Just sit there.
I just hope you don't mind my hand right here.
Not touching.
Can't get mad!
Not touching.
Can't get mad!
Not touching.
Can't get mad!
Oh, my God!
You rotten boys!
-Sorry, Phoebe.
-What am I gonna do?
Don't rub it!
What gets out hummus?
What gets out hummus?
Monica!
What gets out hummus?
If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
Okay, thanks.
Yeah, I'll try that.
Maybe he called to say you' re obsessive and crazy?
-So should I call him back?
-No!
No!
-Fine, we'll both sit in the chair.
-Fine with me.
I am so comfortable.
Me too.
In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
Okay, we have 1 9 minutes.
I want you to go and change.
When you come back, Joey will go change and he'll have vacated the chair.
-Okay.
-All right.
Fine.
I' m going.
When I get back, it's Chair City.
And I' m the guy.
.
.
.
.
.
who's sitting in a chair!
Is this a little too-- Pheebs?
What happened?
I got the hummus.
Oh, honey, we'll find you something.
You wanna wear my black jacket?
-It won't go with this dress.
-You' re right.
-Well, let's just get you out of that.
-No, no, no.
Not "out of that.
" -Not "out" of clothes.
-Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
I called him.
Yes.
I got his machine and I left a message.
But it's okay.
It's okay.
.
.
.
.
.
because it was, like, a casual, breezy message.
It was breezy.
Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?
How could it not be breezy?
No.
Because you' re in such a breezy place.
I got it.
I'll play my message and you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.
But how you gonna do that?
I know the code to his answering machine.
Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the-- Okay, you' re dialing.
You are dialing.
Hi, this is Richard.
Please leave a message at the tone.
You have two new messages.
What a cool job.
"You have two new messages.
" Please pass the pie.
Hi, it's Monica.
I'm just checking in.
I got a message and didn't know if it was old or new.
So I'm just checking.
So let me know.
Or don't.
Whatever.
I'm breezy!
You can't say you' re "breezy.
" That negates the "breezy.
" Hola.
It's me.
Yesterday was really fun.
Call me about this weekend, okay?
Now, she sounded breezy.
He's seeing someone.
I can't believe he's seeing someone.
-You don't know that.
-Well, whose voice was that?
Maybe it was his sister's.
Maybe it was his daughter's.
Michelle.
Of course!
Did it sound like Michelle?
Oh, great.
It's starting to rain.
That'll make it easier to get a cab.
It was Michelle.
It was definitely Michelle.
Try Monica's green dress.
If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.
-Unless I wear it.
-You don't know what you' re wearing?
I' m just trying to look nice for your big night.
Yeah, which we have to leave for in 1 2 minutes.
Come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
You'll notice that I' m fully dressed.
I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.
So in the words of A.A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dill-hole.
" Okay.
-What are you doing?
-You said to give you the chair.
You didn't say anything about cushions.
They' re the essence of the chair!
That's right!
I' m taking the essence.
Oh, he'll be back.
Oh, there's nobody in the room.
-I' m sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
-That was a Halloween costume.
Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.
I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
Rach, good!
Listen, isn't this perfect for me?
Oh, it's perfect!
But not for tonight.
Of course, not for tonight.
Hi.
I' m going to a benefit.
Not for tonight?
What are you doing?
No, I' m sorry.
We didn't mean it.
I love you.
Breathe.
We used them as pillows when we went camping.
What?
The sheep.
Hey, what you do on your own time.
.
.
.
Where's my underwear?
-Come on, you took his underwear?
-He took my essence!
Okay, hold on.
Why can't you just wear the underwear you' re wearing now?
Because I' m not wearing any underwear now.
Then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It's a rented tux, okay?
I' m not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.
Okay.
You hide my clothes, I' m gonna do the exact opposite to you.
What, are you gonna show me my clothes?
Hey, opposite.
.
.
.
.
.
is opposite.
He's got nothing!
Okay, I' m ready.
Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.
I thought, all right, I'll be political.
-What are you supporting?
-Christmas.
Hey, that's okay with me.
Two down, and I have exactly 1 2 minutes-- What?
My watch stopped.
My watch.
Okay, see.
.
.
.
.
.
the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore.
What time is it?
It's 7:33.
I have 7 minutes.
I have seven minutes!
Which shoes should I wear?
The black or the purple?
-Just pick one, okay?
-Oh, okay, okay.
The black.
Do you have black with little strappies?
Yeah.
But those go better with pants.
Maybe I should wear pants.
Yeah, pants!
What an idea!
Or better yet, go without pants.
I don't know what you' re doing, but just get in there.
.
.
.
.
.
and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.
I don't care if they match.
I don't care if they make.
.
.
.
.
.
your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat.
Just do it!
Go in there, pick something out so we can go.
-All right.
-Thank you.
I've got to call Michelle to see if that was her voice.
It was.
It was her voice.
Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
Hola.
Hello?
Hello?
-Okay.
That was her, right?
-Definitely.
Yeah.
So there you go.
We' re out of the woods.
I think I'll get dressed now.
-I'll get it.
-Okay.
Hi, Monica and Rachel's.
Yeah, just a second.
Can I ask who's calling?
It's Michelle!
She must have that "caller l.D. " thing.
You should get that.
Michelle?
Yeah, that was me.
I dialed your number by mistake.
Just try to be-- You' re so sweet.
Yeah, we were a great couple.
I know, I really miss him.
Well, you know how it is.
It's just that.
.
.
.
You know what's weird?
Donald Duck never wore pants.
But when he gets out of the shower.
.
.
.
.
.
he always puts a towel around his waist.
I mean, what is that about?
I only beeped in so I could hear my own message.
I mean, that's allowed.
I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about-- What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this?
We' re friends!
That bitch always hated me.
I' m calling her back.
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.
-She's got a phone in there, right?
-Okay, we' re on it.
I know it says "black tie optional" .
.
.
.
.
.
but this may be pushing it a little.
I' m not gonna go.
You' re not gonna go?
No, I think I' m gonna catch up on my correspondence.
How can you not be going?
I' m not gonna go.
So I think that will accomplish the "not going.
" You know, just out of curiosity-- Ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends.
.
.
.
.
.
I' m just, I don't know, not in a very museum benefit-y kind of mood.
Right.
Well, okay.
Okay.
God, I' m sorry.
I' m sorry I yelled.
-That's fine.
-No, but you' re mad.
I' m not mad.
I' m just not going.
-Right.
-Okay.
You know that I have to go, right?
So is it gonna be, like, I' m abandoning you while you' re upset?
-No.
-No?
-You' re not upset about the yelling.
-Right.
And the humiliating.
Well, of course, the humiliating.
So we.
.
.
.
.
.
we' re okay?
-We' re good.
-Right.
-Honey?
I love you.
-Yes, Ross.
Get away from that phone!
She's just getting dressed now.
Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
You hide my clothes, I' m wearing everything you own.
Oh, my God!
That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
Look at me!
I' m Chandler.
Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going commando.
.
.
.
It's hot with all this stuff on.
I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Okay, enough.
Enough with the lunging.
I' m sick of this.
I've had it up to here.
Neither of you can come to the party!
Jeez, what a baby!
Way to ruin it.
I was just gonna go get dressed.
The only person I cared about getting dressed.
.
.
.
.
.
is the person who's not even gonna go.
Look, Rach, I' m sorry, okay?
Look, I was a jerk, okay?
I' m sorry I yelled.
I want you there.
I need you there.
What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there?
You could drink the fat.
Welcome to an adult conversation.
No, no, no.
Now wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
-That actually sounds interesting.
-What?
I think you should drink the fat.
Okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me.
.
.
.
.
.
and how much I want you there, that's what I'll do.
Let me get you another glass.
That's been sitting out.
I think this will be fine.
Okay, vanilla milkshake.
Just a vanilla milkshake.
.
.
.
.
.
with chicken bits floating in it.
Cheers.
No, don't!
Okay, okay, I'll go.
I'll go.
You will?
You were really gonna do that.
Well, yeah.
You were gonna drink the fat.
Let's see what else he'll do!
How about you get changed?
Give him his underwear.
I'll get a cab.
I want everyone downstairs in two minutes.
Monica!
Stop it.
Stop it!
Ross went to get a cab, so we-- What are you doing?
No, Monica, no!
Hi, this is Richard.
You have three new messages.
Not anymore.
Message erased.
To record your message, begin speaking at the tone.
Hi, Richard.
It's Monica.
Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
Maybe I' m getting my period or something.
I don't know.
Anyway, I beeped into your machine and I heard this message.
.
.
.
.
.
that freaked me out.
.
.
.
.
.
and Michelle will tell you the rest.
I' m sorry, okay?
And I hope that we can just forget the whole thing.
Your outgoing message has now been changed.
Outgoing?
Did that say outgoing?
Not outgoing!
Hi, Richard, it's Monica.
Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
Maybe I'm getting my period or something.
I don't know.
-How did you do that?
-I don't know!
Goodbye.
Okay, I've got two cabs and no people!
Go, go, go!
Maybe we can call the phone company to change the message?
They could change his number.
I think after this, he'll be doing that himself.
Rachel!
You.
.
.
.
You look.
.
.
.
And I still have about five seconds to spare.
That was about 7 seconds.
So we' re a little late.
Come on.
Oh, and by the way.
.
.
.
What?
I' m going commando too.
Dr. Geller?
-Sherman Whitfield, London lnstitute.
-What a pleasure.
I was quite impressed with your paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.
Yes.
It confirmed everything I'd written.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Yes?
You' re kind of sitting in my seat.
What do you mean, your seat?
-I mean, I was sitting there.
-But you got up.
But I never left the room.
But you left the chair area.
All right, that's it.
Give me your underwear.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed!
The One With the Jam .
:staz:.
Hey, look at me!
I' m making jam!
-I've been at it since 4 a.m. -Where'd you get fruit at 4 a.m.?
Down at the docks.
You know, you can get it wholesale.
I didn't know there were docks.
Is it broken?
No, but I gotta wear this for a couple weeks.
You tell the doctor you did it jumping on your bed?
No.
I had a whole story worked out, but then.
.
.
.
.
.
Chandler sold me out.
I didn't think the doctor would buy that it "fell out of the socket.
" What is this?
Fruit?
Monica's making jam.
Jam?
I love jam!
How come we never have jam at our place?
Because the kids need new shoes.
I' m going into business.
I' m sick of being depressed about Richard.
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.
What's the opposite of man?
Jam!
Joey, don't!
It's way too hot!
This'll just be my batch.
That's it.
Hey, you, J .
Crew guy.
.
.
.
Why are you following me?
All week, everywhere I look, there's you.
You wouldn't return my calls.
You sent back my letters.
One more chance, Ursula.
Please.
This is awkward.
Yeah, because you want Ursula, and I' m Phoebe.
Twin sisters.
Seriously.
That's great.
I' m stalking the wrong woman.
I am such a dingus!
Oh, you' re not a dingus.
I just want you to know I wasn't always like this.
Before I met your sister, I was a normal guy who sold cellular phones.
Look, it's not your fault.
I mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay?
Well, thanks.
Wait.
I got a little story.
Once, in junior high school, I thought I was a witch.
And a guidance counselor told me something that might help you.
He said, "Okay, you' re not a witch.
You' re just an average student.
" -See what I' m saying?
-Not really.
Well, get over it.
You seem like a really nice guy.
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?
You' re right.
I know you' re right.
And thanks for being so nice.
Thanks a lot.
Want to get some coffee?
You don't have to walk behind me anymore.
"Gone for more jars.
Be back later.
Monica Geller.
" Wait a minute.
Look!
It's an empty apartment.
We' re all alone in an empty apartment.
I have to be at work in 1 0 minutes.
All right.
It's not like I' m employee of the year or anything.
There it is!
Oh, that's what you mean.
Do I look fat?
No.
I accept that.
When Janice asked me and I said no, she thought I was calling her a cow.
Walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.
Janice said, "Hi.
Do I look fat today"?
And I looked at her-- You looked at her?
You never look.
You just answer.
It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat"?
"No.
" "Is she prettier than I am"?
"No.
" "Does size matter"?
And it works both ways.
So you both just know this stuff?
After 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
Okay.
For instance: Janice is coming back from a trip.
She gives you two options.
Option one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.
Option two: You can meet her at baggage claim.
What do you do?
Easy.
Baggage claim.
Wrong!
Now you' re single.
It's actually secret option number three.
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.
Okay, this is good.
All right, I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle.
.
.
.
.
.
at night, which I' m all for.
But when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
So how do I tell her that without.
.
.
.
.
.
you know, accidentally calling her fat or something?
Sorry, honey.
We can't help you there, because we' re cuddly sleepers.
I' m late for work.
-Are you guys coming down?
-Yeah.
I' m right behind you.
Good luck, Chandler.
The sleeping thing.
very tricky business, but solvable.
I thought you were "cuddly sleepers.
" No, not cuddly.
Not me.
Just her.
I' m like you.
I need the room.
Okay, come here.
Okay.
You' re in bed.
I'll use the cushion.
Okay.
You' re in bed.
She's over on your side, cuddling.
Now, you wait for her to drift off.
.
.
.
.
.
and then you hug her.
.
.
.
.
.
and roll her over to her side of the bed.
And then you.
.
.
.
.
.
roll away.
Hug for her.
Roll for you.
The old "hug and roll.
" One question.
You' re pretending the pillow's a girl, right?
Remember when you were a kid, your mom would send you to the movies.
.
.
.
.
.
with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
You' re so pretty.
You know that guy who's been following me?
I talked to him today.
You talked to him?
Are you crazy?
First, I' m not crazy.
And second, say it, don't spray it.
Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.
I mean, he was, but he thought I was Ursula.
That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.
Because of the restraining order.
Not feeling better about Malcolm.
No, no, he's not a kook.
He's just this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy.
.
.
.
.
.
that just got a teensy bit carried away.
We get along really well, and he's so cute.
Oh, my God!
You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
I' m going to help him get "de-Ursula-ized.
" Like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
I didn't stalk her.
I asked for the news, not the weather.
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.
Joe, I got to ask.
The girl from the xerox place, buck naked.
.
.
.
.
.
or a big tub of jam?
Put your hands together.
Take your time with that.
It's my last batch.
No more jam?
What happened to your jam plan?
I figured out I'd need to charge $ 1 7 a jar just to break even.
So I've got a new plan now.
Babies.
Well, you'll need much bigger jars.
-What are you talking about?
-About me having a baby.
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.
The jam plan helped me take control of my life.
So I thought, "What is the most important thing to me"?
And that's when I came up with the baby plan.
Aren't you forgetting something?
What is that guy's name?
Dad!
It took me 28 years to find a man I wanted to spend my life with.
If I have to wait another 28 years, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
And that's just stupid.
That's what's stupid?
I don't need an actual man.
Just a few of his best swimmers.
And there are places you can go to get that.
.
.
stuff.
Down to the docks again?
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.
Night-night.
.
.
.
.
.
Janice.
Look at all the room on her side!
A giant penguin could fit over there.
That'd be weird, though.
Hug and roll time.
I'm hugging.
I'm hugging.
You're rolling, and.
Yes!
Freedom!
Except for this arm!
I'm stuck.
Stuck arm.
Time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.
Quick like a cat.
And one, two three!
Here's my binoculars.
Oh, great.
You' re doing great.
Going strong.
Keep going.
These are my night-vision goggles.
This is the book I pretend to read when I' m watching her in the park.
And these are Madlibs.
They' re just for fun.
This is the log I kept, recording her every movement.
Want to hear some of it?
Not even a little bit.
It's about you.
Okay then.
"I met Phoebe today.
She was really nice to me even though I' m such a loser.
And when I was walking home, I thought about her a lot.
It was weird, but kind of cool.
" Good.
So what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.
-Really?
-No.
That's just something I said now so that maybe I could kiss you.
Oh, okay.
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.
Okay.
Sperm donor number 0381 5, come on down!
Okay, he's 6' 2", 1 70 pounds.
He describes himself as a male Gina Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us?
You can't do this, Mon.
If you do this, I'll-- -You'll what?
-I'll tell Mom.
I' m sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you' re crazy.
Why?
Why is this crazy?
-So this isn't the ideal way-- -Oh, it's not-- Lips moving.
Still talking.
It may not be ideal, but.
.
.
.
.
.
I' m so ready.
I see the way Ben looks at you.
It makes me ache, you know?
Check it out!
Jam crackers!
Okay.
All right, how's this?
Twenty-seven, ltalian-American guy.
He's an actor.
Born in Queens.
Wow!
Big family.
Seven sisters.
.
.
.
.
.
and he's the only.
.
.
boy.
Oh, my God!
Under personal comments: "New York Knicks rule.
" Yeah, the Knicks rule!
Joey, this is you!
Let me see.
Oh, right!
You went to a sperm bank?
Right after I did that sex study at NYU.
Remember that sweater I gave you?
That's how you bought it?
No.
That's what I was wearing when I donated.
I' m surprised there's any of my boys left.
It is pretty competitive.
There's an actual rocket scientist here.
Maybe I should have them put my Days of our Lives gig on here.
Juice this up a little.
How's the maniac?
He's yummy.
We did a little kissing.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
No, no.
He's not into that anymore.
He quit for me.
This guy has been obsessed with your sister for God knows how long.
You don't just give that up.
He gave me his night-vision goggles and everything.
You' re taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles?
He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?
Wake up and smell the restraining order.
What should I do?
If you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Thank you, Monica.
Or you could follow him.
That's what I'd do.
Forget mine.
What happened?
Crazy Chandler spun me.
.
.
.
.
.
off the bed.
Wow!
Spinning!
Sounds like fun.
I wish.
He was just trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
Ross' what?
Where he hugs you and then he rolls you away, and.
.
.
.
Oh.
.
.
my.
.
.
God!
What are you doing?
Oh, I was just here looking for my.
.
.
my.
.
.
.
Part of an old sandwich.
Here it is!
Were you following me?
Perhaps.
Yes.
I' m sorry.
I was afraid you were still hung up on my sister.
So you spied on me.
I can't believe you don't trust me.
Well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister!
Just walking along, looking like me.
Is this a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.
I' m so pathetic.
No, it's not your fault.
It's partly my fault.
I made you quit cold turkey.
Well, I can't date you anymore because you' re, you know.
.
.
.
Wow!
But I will definitely help you get over my sister.
Okay?
Stalk me for a while, huh?
I'll be like an Ursula patch.
I don't know.
Just.
.
.
.
Look, I' m going!
Come on.
I' m on the pillar.
Which way will I go?
-Where you going?
-To the bank.
Sperm or regular?
Sperm.
You' re really doing it?
Oh, yeah.
I picked a guy.
Sounds nice.
He does.
He's got brown hair and green eyes.
No kidding?
I figured you'd have picked a blond.
Really?
Why?
I always pictured you with a tall, smart, blond guy with a name like.
.
.
.
.
.
Hoyt.
It's a name.
Yeah.
I saw you in this great house with a big pool.
Is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.
I like that.
What?
You have a sign that says: "We don't swim in your toilet.
Don't pee in our pool.
" We don't have that sign.
You do!
It was a gift from me.
And you have three great kids.
Two girls and a boy?
And they wear little water wings, and they run around on the deck.
And Hoyt wraps a towel around all three of them.
Sure.
But, you know, this way sounds good too.
Yeah.
Wow!
This guy's an astronaut?
That would have been cool.
.
.
.
.
.
for a day.
I called the sperm bank.
They haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani.
Nobody wants my product.
I don't get it.
Maybe if they met me in person.
You got a thing on your.
.
.
.
Get it?
Yeah.
Hello.
Hello.
Chan, can I talk to you for a second?
Sure.
What's up?
Just one additional relationship thought.
Something you' re probably aware of.
Women talk.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Welcome, everybody!
Welcome to Amazing Discoveries!
It's on again!
Guys, could we please not watch this?
This ever happen to you?
You go to get a glass of milk but these cartons are so flinging, flanging hard to open!
Boy, you said it, Mike.
-There's gotta be a better way.
-There is, Kevin!
-Can we please turn this off?
-No way, Kevin!
What if I told you there's a new product that guarantees you'll never have to open up milk cartons again?
Meet the Milkmaster 2000!
-Intrigued?
-You' re flinging, flanging right I am!
This is the first time he's used this.
You'll see how easy this is to do.
-This works in any milk carton.
-Wow, it is easy!
Now I can have milk every day.
The One With the Metaphorical Tunnel .
:staz:.
It's official.
There are no good movies.
So let's go to a bad one, and make out.
Perhaps you'd like me to turn so you can bunny-bump against my back?
-Hey, man.
What's up?
-Maybe you can tell me.
My agent wants to know why I didn't show up at my audition today.
.
.
.
.
.
my first good one in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt.
.
.
.
.
.
but it wasn't me.
Yes, it was.
It was him!
Okay, it was me!
-How was it you?
-Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
Chandler was in the closet, counting to 1 0.
.
.
.
.
.
and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand.
See?
All of it.
Yep, that's my audition.
See?
Now, this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Yep.
And that's why we don't invite you to play.
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.
Estelle tried.
The casting director told her I missed my chance.
Well, that is unfair!
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was my fault.
You can't.
The casting director doesn't talk to friends.
-She only talks to agents.
-What a sad little life she must lead.
-What are you doing?
-No, I know, I know.
Hi, this is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office.
Is Anne there for Phoebe?
She'll know what it's about.
Hang up.
Hang up right-- Annie?
Hi.
Listen, we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?
Estelle?
I don't know what to do with her.
So your husband leaves and burns down the apartment.
The world doesn't stop.
Is anybody else scared?
If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle.
I don't care!
Annie, you are a doll.
What time can you see him?
I need a pen.
Pen!
Get the woman a pad!
Get the woman a pad!
A pad!
A pad!
Oh, now you want a pad.
Where's my boy?
Here's my boy!
And here's his Barbie!
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
He picked it out at the store.
He loves it.
He carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Yeah, it's cute.
Why does he have it again?
So he's got a doll.
So what?
Unless you' re afraid he's gonna grow up to be.
.
.
.
.
.
in show business.
This wouldn't have to do with the fact.
.
.
.
.
.
that he's being raised by two women?
You know what?
It's fine.
If you' re okay with the Barbie thing, so am l. Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie.
Don't you wanna play with a monster truck?
No?
Okay.
How about a Dino-Soldier?
You are so pathetic.
Why can't your son just play with his doll?
I gotta go to work.
Has anybody seen my left boob?
I loved that movie.
Here it is.
What are you doing?
I' m sorry.
It just felt nice.
Answer the phone.
I only got one arm.
You should do stuff for me.
Get me a sweater.
Just do it!
It's Janice.
And if I get it, I'll have to see her tonight.
That's great.
I'll have to see her tonight.
Why don't you want to see Janice?
Last night at dinner, when the meals came.
.
.
.
.
.
she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
And that's bad.
.
.
.
.
.
because you hate chicken piccata?
You didn't want to share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.
Suddenly, we were this "couple.
" And this alarm started going off in my head.
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!
" Men are unbelievable.
What is it with you people?
The minute you feel something, you have to run away?
I know.
That-- That's why I don't want to go tonight.
I' m afraid I'll say something stupid.
You mean that "guy thing" where you act mean and distant.
.
.
.
.
.
until we break up with you?
You know about that?
What do I do?
I wanna get past this.
I don't want to be afraid of commitment.
I want to go through the tunnel to the other side!
Where there's no fear of commitment.
Do we have any-- Do we have any thoughts here?
I've never been through the tunnel myself because.
.
.
.
.
.
you' re not allowed through with more than one girl in the car.
But it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else.
Face your fear.
Fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.
You' re afraid of bugs.
Get a bug.
You have a fear of commitment.
So I say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was!
Amazingly, that makes sense.
-Do you think?
-Oh, yeah!
Go for it, man!
Jump off the high dive!
Stare down the barrel of the gun!
Pee into the wind!
If I' m staring down the barrel of a gun.
.
.
.
.
.
I' m gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.
It's your audition from this morning!
Can I use the phone?
Sure, that's what it's there for.
Emergencies and pretend agents.
Come on, baby!
Come on!
Hi.
I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.
Okay, she's in her car.
I'll have to patch you through.
very nice touch.
Okay, go ahead.
Talk, talk, talk!
Hi, Annie?
Fantastic.
You got it!
Will he work for scale, you ask me?
Well, I don't know about that.
Except that I do and he will.
Great.
Oh, you are such a sweetheart.
I would love to have lunch with you!
How about we have lunch next-- Went through a tunnel.
Unbelievable.
Oh, thank you so much!
It was really fun.
I mean, I've never talked on a car phone before.
You are so amazing!
Could you do me this huge favor?
There's another audition I want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
I don't know.
It was fun one time, but-- Please?
It would just be this one more.
Well, actually it's two.
Two?
Well, really it's three.
Please?
You' re so good at it.
I love you.
Okay.
But just these three, right?
No, it's four.
So how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
Because I wanted.
.
.
.
.
.
to give you this.
Are you a puppy!
Contact paper!
What do you say when someone you' re sleeping with.
.
.
.
.
.
gives you contact paper?
Wait, there's more.
See, the contact paper is to go.
.
.
.
.
.
in your brand new drawer!
See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
You didn't have to do this.
Yes, I did.
Yes, I did.
Because you' re my girlfriend.
.
.
.
.
.
and that's what girlfriends should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel.
.
.
.
.
.
because, oh, my God!
Who would've thought that someday.
.
.
.
.
.
Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?
Well, not me.
But that's what's happened.
And there's more.
We should take a trip.
We should?
We' re a couple, and that's what couples do.
And I wanna meet your parents.
We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to because you' re tripping me out right now!
Are you okay?
No, I am.
I actually am!
This is amazing.
My entire life, I have feared this place.
And now that I' m here, it's like, what was the big deal?
I could probably say, "Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?
-It doesn't scare me!
-Yeah, well it scares me!
I' m not even divorced yet!
You just invited me over here for pasta.
.
.
.
.
.
and now you' re talking about moving in together.
And I wasn't even that hungry.
You know what?
It's getting really late, and I should just-- Don't go!
I've scared you!
I've said too much!
I' m hopeless and awkward and desperate for love!
Hey, Janice, it's me.
I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
Here you go, honey.
This will help.
So I catch up to her and she says.
.
.
.
.
.
this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.
That is never good.
Then I got all.
.
.
.
.
.
needy and clingy.
Wait a minute.
Maybe it's not so bad.
How did you leave it?
She said she'd call me.
Oh, God.
Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.
Well, it's that low-cal-nondairy-soymilk junk.
We save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.
When you' re getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low fat.
Yeah, you do.
You don't think I' m terminal?
Not at all.
You' re not terminal.
We just need some damage control.
Okay.
Should I call her?
It's a critical time.
If you feel yourself reaching for that phone.
.
.
.
.
.
go shopping, get your butt in a bubble bath.
If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.
She has to know you' re not needy.
So what you have to do is.
.
.
.
.
.
you have to accidentally run into her on purpose.
.
.
.
.
.
and then act aloof.
So I' m not gonna lose her?
Oh, honey, you' re not a total loser.
I said, "So I' m not gonna lose her"?
Guess who's here!
It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben!
Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe!
Drop the Barbie.
Drop the Barbie.
G.I. Joe?
You really think he'll fall for that?
G.I. Joe?
Cool!
Can I play?
Look, Ben!
It's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!
Go, Joe!
-There you are!
-No, it's not.
Sorry.
But, Phoebe, wait, wait.
Phoebe!
Oh, Joey!
Oh, okay!
See, I didn't recognize you.
.
.
.
.
.
in those pants.
That Tv movie I went in for, did you hear anything?
I think I got a shot at it.
Yes, they called!
You didn't get it!
Okay?
I mean, you didn't get it.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
That's okay.
These things happen.
But they shouldn't happen.
You know what?
You' re in a terrible, terrible business.
I don't want to be the person who makes you look like that.
I' m okay.
See?
Now you' re sad and creepy.
I' m sorry.
I quit.
No, no, you can't quit!
You' re the best agent I ever had.
Rejection is part of being an actor.
You can't take it personal.
They said they'd never met an ltalian actor with a worse ltalian accent.
They actually said that?
Oh, God, there's that face again.
See?
I can't do this job!
This is why you have to do this job!
Agents always lie.
Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way.
" But this?
I can use this.
I can work on a new accent.
Yeah, okay.
If it helps you, okay.
Yeah.
You'll never get me, Joe!
No, thank you.
What are you doing here?
Just a bit of shopping.
How have you been?
Are you being British?
Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here?
You don't live in this neighborhood.
Were you here waiting for me?
I' m just.
.
.
.
.
.
picking up some things for a party.
Barley?
What kind of party serves barley?
I' m sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?
Here in Chelsea.
Whose party is it?
A woman's.
What woman?
Chelsea.
Either you' re seeing somebody behind my back.
.
.
.
.
.
which would make you the world's biggest jerk.
.
.
.
.
.
or you' re pretending to see somebody.
.
.
.
.
.
which makes you so pathetic I could cry right here!
So which of these two guys do you want to be?
Can I be that guy?
Okay, we got some more good rejections.
Lots of stuff to work on.
Okay.
Shoot.
Okay.
Oh, the zoo commercial.
I didn't get it?
They said that you "weren't believable as a human being.
" So you can work on that.
Great.
What else?
The off-Broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb.
" Oh, no wait.
I' m sorry.
That's "pretty dumb.
" Look, it's okay, no, no, no.
Really.
Look.
.
.
.
.
.
I really appreciate this.
.
.
.
.
.
but I' m gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Don't get me wrong.
You' re a better agent than she is.
.
.
.
.
.
but at least with her, I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Yeah, no, I understand.
You do?
Thanks.
Okay.
Sorry.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Did you make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent?
Oh, he caught me.
I am so busted!
That's what I suspected!
And then I just, you know.
.
.
.
.
.
threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
My God, Chandler, we said be "aloof," not "a doof.
" I've actually ruined this, haven't l?
Is it time for the good ice cream now?
Yeah, it is.
You know what?
Everything's gonna be okay.
Can you hold on for a second?
What do I do?
I don't know.
This is unprecedented.
If we did what you did, a man would never call.
I got it!
Pretend you just woke up.
That'll throw her off!
-Be sleepy!
-Yes!
And grumpy!
What are you--?
Stop naming dwarfs!
I' m so glad that you called.
I know I've been acting really weird lately.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's just because I' m crazy about you.
.
.
.
.
.
and I just got stupid and scared.
.
.
.
.
.
and stupid a couple more times.
And I' m sorry.
Really?
Really?
He's so lucky.
If Janice were a guy.
.
.
.
.
.
she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.
It's so unfair!
G.I. Joe?
G.I. Joe?
!
I don't know what to tell you guys.
That's the doll he chose.
What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.
And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.
What are you being such a weenie for?
So he has a Barbie.
Big deal.
You used to dress up like a woman.
What?
The way you used to dress up in Mom's clothes?
What are you talking about?
The big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag?
Okay.
You are totally making this up.
How can you not remember?
You made us call you "Bea"?
Oh, God.
I've literally never been this happy.
Wasn't there a little song?
Oh, please, God, let there be a song.
There was no song.
There was no song.
I am Bea -I drink tea-- -That's enough.
Won't you.
Won't you.
Won't you.
Won't you dance around with me?
I am Bea I drink tea Won't you dance around with--?
Ross?
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
So what happened?
Did a forest tick you off?
We always say we need a place for the mail.
I started building one.
But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You' re building a post office?
No, an entertainment unit, with a built-in mail cubby.
It's a one-day job, max.
My word, those are snug!
These are my old work pants.
Sergio valente.
Power saw kind of got away from me there.
The One With Frank Jr. .
:staz:.
Hey, Pheebs.
Any sign of your brother?
No, but he's always late.
-I thought you only met him once.
-I did.
I think it sounds big sister-y, "Frank's always late.
" Well, relax.
He'll be here.
I know.
I' m just nervous.
It's just, Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister.
.
.
.
.
.
Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately.
It's just the "Iast-desperate- chance-to-have-a-family" kind of thing.
You' re sweet to wait with me.
Actually, Gunther sent me.
You' re not allowed to have cups out here.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield's cute?
No.
But he told me he thinks you' re a fox.
All right.
Janice likes him.
In fact, she likes him so much, she put him on her "freebie" Iist.
Her what?
We have a deal where we each pick five celebrities we could sleep with.
.
.
.
.
.
and the other one can't get mad.
The heart of every healthy relationship: Honesty, respect and sex with celebrities.
So who's on your list?
Kim Basinger.
.
.
.
.
.
Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry.
.
.
.
.
.
Yasmine Bleeth.
.
.
.
.
.
and Jessica Rabbit.
You do realize that she is a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know.
I just wonder if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
Who would yours be?
First, I need a boyfriend.
Then I can have a list.
It's just a game, Mon.
Rach, how about you?
I don't know.
I guess Chris O' Donnell, John F. Kennedy Jr. .
.
.
.
.
Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting and Parker Stevenson.
Spiderman?
Hardy Boy.
-Peter Parker.
-Thank you.
What about you, honey?
Who'd be on your list?
That kind of thing requires some serious thought.
First, I'd divide my prospective candidates into categories.
What a geek!
Everybody, this is Frank!
My half brother, Frank!
This is everybody.
-This is Ross.
-How are you?
This is Monica.
And this is Rachel.
I' m gonna get coffee for us.
Hey, how do you guys get anything done?
We don't, really.
Do you guys have big plans?
Oh, yeah.
We' re gonna connect and bond and everything.
I thought we could go down to Times Square and pick up some ninja stars.
My friend, Larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.
We really don't take advantage of living in the city.
Oh, sorry.
Did I get you?
No, you didn't "get" me!
It's an electric drill!
You "get" me, you kill me!
Calm down!
Do you want this unit or not?
I do not want this unit!
You should've told me before.
I' m not a mind reader.
And we' re out of beer.
I' m going to Monica's.
Fine!
Where you heading in those pants?
I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale.
.
.
.
.
.
if you wanna redo your bathroom floor.
What's wrong with my bathroom floor?
Nothing.
It's just old and dingy, that's all.
I highly doubt that.
If you move your hamper.
.
.
.
.
.
you see how the tile used to be.
I can't live like this!
What are we gonna do?
Relax.
Here, hold this.
This old stuff comes right up.
I'll show you.
A little more than I wanted to see.
Look at that!
Every inch of this is glued down!
It'd take forever to pry this up.
You should just leave it.
I can't leave it!
You gouged a hole in my dingy floor!
There.
There you go.
Yeah, that's nice.
We can put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
I know what I wanted to ask you.
Can you roll your tongue?
Because I can and my mom couldn't.
And I figured that was something I got from our dad.
Well, wait, you mean like this?
Yeah, you can do it too.
Yeah.
You' re not doing it.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Yeah, my mom could and I can't.
We don't have that.
When's your birthday?
February 1 6th.
I know a guy who's the 1 8th.
That's close.
When's yours?
October 25th.
That's the same month as Halloween.
So what kind of things do you like to do at home?
Melt stuff.
-Okay, I've got three of my five.
-Three of your five what?
Celebrities I' m allowed to sleep with.
God, you' re giving this a lot of thought.
Hey, it's hard, okay?
I only have two spots left.
All right.
Who you got it narrowed down to?
Elizabeth Hurley.
very attractive.
Forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.
You know what?
She's too political.
She'd probably make you donate four cans of food first.
And lsabella Rossellini.
very hot.
very sexy.
But she's too international.
She's never gonna be around.
-So?
-So you gotta play the odds.
Pick somebody who's gonna be in the country all the time.
Yeah.
Because that's why you won't get lsabella Rossellini.
Geography.
Okay.
So by "melting" you meant melting.
So is it, like, art?
Yeah, you can melt art.
Hey, can I use your phone?
-Sure.
You want to call your mom?
-No, I want to melt it.
Oh.
Well, not right now.
I' m gonna go to bed.
The fumes are giving me a headache.
So.
.
.
.
Good night, "bro.
" Good night.
Here.
Just in case.
Oh, excellent!
-What kind of karate is that?
-No kind.
He just makes it up.
-How's it going with you guys?
-So far it kind of blows.
I don't know, I just thought he'd feel more like a brother.
Like you and Ross.
Close and connected and.
.
.
.
We' re close now.
You wouldn't believe the years.
.
.
.
.
.
of noogies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies and.
.
.
.
That's when the waistband goes over your head.
We drove each other crazy playing the shadow game.
-How do you play the shadow game?
-How do you play the shadow game?
-I just asked you.
-I just asked you.
I don't have time for this.
-That is what the game is.
-You just gave up really quickly.
-Seen Joey?
-What's the matter?
Oh, just this!
It's my fault, really, because the couch is where we keep the varnish.
Somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles?
-What's going on?
-He's retiling my floor.
Spackle boy!
-Get up!
-You started this, you'll finish it!
He started mine first!
Build the unit, Cinderellie Lay the tile, Cinderellie Big octopus.
Oh, my God!
I totally forgot!
Well, can't someone else do it?
But I have company.
Look, that's all right.
I'll come in.
I' m sorry, but I have to go into work.
It's one of my regulars who's insisting that I do him, so.
.
.
.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?
I' m a masseuse.
I give people massages and stuff.
You work at one of those massage parlors?
Well, you know, we don't call it that.
But, yeah.
That's wild.
No, I had no idea.
Alrighty.
I'll be back in a little bit.
Unless you want to come with me.
You mean, like, watch?
No.
No, you can get one yourself.
It'll be on the house.
What are big sisters for?
Well, I don't think this.
You know?
No.
No, no.
I wouldn't do you myself.
I mean, that would be weird.
I'll get one of the other girls to do it.
This is so much fun!
Are you excited?
Hey, do Monica and Rachel work there?
It's beautiful!
It's like the first bathroom floor there ever was!
What are you going in there for?
You want, like, a number?
Hi.
Bye.
Okay.
I' m done with my choices.
These are final.
-Well, it's about time.
-Yeah.
very official.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, Chandler printed it up on his computer.
And who laminated it?
That was me.
All right, let me see.
"Uma Thurman, Winona Ryder, Elizabeth Hurley.
.
.
.
.
.
Michelle Pfeiffer.
.
.
.
.
.
Dorothy Hamill"?
Hey, it's my list!
You do realize she only spins like that on ice?
-What's going on?
-She broke my arm!
-He touched my fanny.
-She touched mine first!
That's my job!
So what's the deal?
I can have sex with you but I can't touch you?
-You can't have sex with her!
-Did you think I was a hooker?
No, okay.
I know.
You' re a masseuse.
It's cool.
I' m not a cop!
Ask Mr. Wiffler if he can wait for five minutes.
Fine.
I don't like you.
So that's what you thought I did?
God!
That's not what I do!
Wait, that's not what you do?
No!
Why would you think that?
I don't know.
This is the city, you know?
I just.
.
.
.
I mean.
.
.
.
.
.
I don't know.
Whatever.
It's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyway.
Oh, wait.
No, you' re right.
No, it was perfect.
I can't believe I screwed it up so bad.
You thought it was perfect?
Well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect.
.
.
.
.
.
but you know, it was pretty cool, you know?
Because we had all those great talks, you know?
Which ones in particular were great for you?
Well, you know, about the tongue thing, you know?
And how I told you about my likes and my dislikes.
How I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn't melt.
Right.
Okay.
I feel like I can really talk to you because you' re my sister, you know?
Yeah.
I guess I do.
And then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.
Well, I wasn't hopping mad, you know?
You hopped a little bit.
Yeah, I' m really sorry.
You know, I' m really.
.
.
.
Okay.
Well, this is my favorite part of the weekend.
Right now.
This.
This?
Oh, come on.
We went to Times Square.
We found ninja stars.
I almost get my arm broken by a hooker-- She's not a hooker.
When I tell my friends about her, she will be.
On 3!
Why don't we just go on 2?
Why 2?
Because it's faster.
I could've counted to 3 four times without all the "2" talk.
-All right, but in the future-- -Heavy thing!
Not getting lighter!
So we are going with two?
A good job, Joe.
Wow.
It's big.
So big it actually makes our doors look smaller.
Maybe my ruler's wrong.
Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
It's not that bad.
So it blocks a little of your door, a little of mine.
I got a better idea.
How about it blocks none of my door, and a lot of your door?
Listen, before I forget, that side is still wet.
Let me just see if I've got this right.
So this is a half-caf, double-tall, easy hazelnut.
.
.
.
.
.
nonfat, no foam, with whip, extra-hot latte, right?
Okay.
Great.
You freak.
Thank you.
A coffee to go, please.
Isabella Rossellini!
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
Damn!
I cannot believe I took her off my list!
Why?
Because otherwise you'd go for it?
Yeah, maybe.
You lie.
You don't think I'd go up to her?
It took you 1 0 years to finally admit you liked me.
Yeah?
Well, missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what, honey?
You go ahead.
We'll call her an alternate.
Hold my cruller.
Are you really gonna let him do this?
He's about to go hit on lsabella Rossellini.
I' m just sorry we don't got popcorn.
I' m Ross.
You don't know me, but I' m a big, big fan of yours.
I mean.
.
.
Blue Velvet.
I was wondering if I could maybe buy you a cup of coffee.
Or reimburse you for that one.
Aren't you with that girl over there?
Well, yeah, kind of.
But that's okay.
We have an understanding.
We each have this list of five famous people, and you were one of mine.
So I' m allowed to sleep with you.
It's flattering.
I don't know-- Wait.
Wait, lsabella.
Don't dismiss this so fast.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Yeah, for you.
Is that the list?
-Yes.
-Can I see it?
-Come on.
-But-- Okay.
I' m not on the list!
But that's not the final draft.
It's laminated.
Okay, see, you were on my list.
But then my friend, Chandler.
.
.
.
.
.
brought up the point that you are international.
So I bumped you for Winona Ryder.
Local.
You know, it's ironic, because I have a list.
.
.
.
.
.
of five goofy coffeehouse guys.
And yesterday, I just bumped you for that guy over there.
We' re just gonna be friends.
You know what?
Bet you I could fit in there.
I got five bucks says you can't.
Get out your checkbook, mister.
Oh, I think I have the cash.
You are dog, man!
I totally fit!
Yeah.
You got me.
I' m out five big ones.
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, well, hello, Mr. Lincoln!
Better luck next time, buddy!
And the drinks are on me!
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you.
.
.
.
.
.
has slept with who of the six of you?
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.
I'm sorry, the answer there would be none of us.
Over the years, none of you ever got drunk and stupid?
Well, that's really a different question.
I can't believe a group of people who spends this much time together.
.
.
.
.
.
has never bumped uglies.
There was that one time Monica and Rachel got together.
What?
Excuse me, there was no "time.
" Okay, but let's say there was.
How might that go?
Well then answer me this: Have any of you ever almost.
.
.
?
-Anybody need more coffee?
-Hey, there's a dog out there!
The One With the Flashback .
:staz:.
-That is so unfortunate.
-What?
Cute Naked Guy's starting to put on weight.
I'll be back in just a minute.
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.
Then it must have been you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
-That's why I moved out.
-Hey, while we're on that.
.
.
.
.
.
when are you gonna tell my sister you don't live here anymore?
On some level, she already knows.
She doesn't know you sneak out every night.
.
.
.
.
.
and back every morning.
.
.
.
.
.
and that you've been at your grandmother's for a week.
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.
Nobody good?
There was the guy with the ferrets.
That's plural.
The spitter.
And the guy who enjoyed my name so much.
.
.
.
.
.
he made a noise every time he said it.
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!
" "Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!
" -How many more tomorrow?
-Two.
This photographer who seemed really dull.
.
.
.
.
.
and this actor guy who I'm not sure about.
When I answered the phone "Chandler Bing" .
.
.
.
.
.
he said, "Whoa!
Short message!
" Foot on the floor or come over no more: Your dresser is missing, but this she notices.
-What?
-I have to go.
Carol should be home by now, so.
.
.
.
-How's it going with you guys?
-Better, actually.
I finally figured out why we're having so much trouble.
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.
You know how I have you guys?
She doesn't have any close friends that are just hers.
But last week, she met this woman at the gym, "Susan" something.
And they really hit it off, and I think it's gonna make a difference.
So, Eric.
.
.
.
.
.
what kind of photography do you do?
Oh, mostly fashion.
There may be models here sometimes.
I hope that's cool.
Yes, that is cool.
Because I have models here, you know.
.
.
: : :never: During the summer I spend most weekends at my sister's beach house.
.
.
.
.
.
which you're welcome to use.
Although I should tell you, she's a porn star.
Well, I still have one more person to meet.
But unless it turns out to be your sister.
.
.
.
.
.
I think your chances are pretty good.
All right.
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.
This here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by.
Bye-bye.
Don't you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure.
What's up?
Well, I'm an actor.
I'm fairly neat.
I got my own Tv.
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?
Just, you know, in general.
The whole "people-being-gay" thing.
Totally cool with that.
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.
Oh, my God!
Hey, Mon.
-Wanna hear something that sucks?
-Do I ever!
-Chris says they're closing the bar.
-No way!
They're turning it into a coffee place.
Just coffee?
-Where are we gonna hang out?
-You got me.
-Can I get a beer?
-Did you pick a roommate?
-You bet.
-Is it the ltalian guy?
Yeah, right.
He's so cute.
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with.
.
.
.
.
.
and be referred to as "the funny one.
" Table's free.
Rack them up.
Back in a minute.
Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we're shooting some pool.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Hi.
My friend ordered an onion.
.
.
.
.
.
not an olive.
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke.
.
.
.
.
.
which I don't think this is.
-I am so sorry.
-That's all right.
How hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?
I would like to propose a toast.
.
.
.
.
.
to the woman who, in one year from today, will become.
.
.
.
.
.
Mrs. Dr. Barry Barber, D.D.S. I think it's time to see the ring again.
Isn't it exciting?
I mean, it's like having a boyfriend for life!
Yeah.
I know.
What?
Oh, I don't know.
Well, maybe it's just the idea.
.
.
.
.
.
of Barry for the rest of my life.
I don't know, I think l. .
.
.
I feel like having one last fling.
.
.
.
.
.
just to sort of get it out of my system.
-Rachel, stop!
-You're so bad!
I'm serious.
I really think I need to just have.
.
.
.
.
.
some meaningless sex, you know?
With the next guy I see.
Excuse me, I seem to have dropped my ball.
Yeah, so?
And now I've picked it up again.
My God!
I went to high school with her.
Look!
Hi!
What do you think?
Oh, my God!
You can't even see where the Titanic hit it.
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.
Just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?
Not right now.
Oh, well, that's okay.
I know.
So I think I'll get back to my friend.
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
Can we have lunch the next time I'm in the city?
That'd be great.
-Okay.
-Thanks.
Ten bucks says I never see that woman again in my life.
No, honey, really.
It's fine.
Just.
.
.
.
.
.
go with Susan.
Really, I think-- I think girls' night out is a great idea.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
-What are they doing?
-I don't know.
Something girly.
Hey, you're early.
What are you doing with the lamp?
Just taking it to get rewired.
Don't take it where you took the stereo.
They've had that over a week.
Mr. Heckles, no one is making any noise up here.
You're disturbing my oboe practice.
-You don't play the oboe.
-I could play the oboe.
Then I'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.
Who are you?
-I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.
-I'm Chandler's new roommate.
-I don't think so.
-I could be Chandler's new roommate.
-But he told me over the phone-- -He told me in person.
That's weird.
I'm going to go into my new apartment now.
Hi again.
Thank you so much.
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that never showed up.
Okay, I gotta get to work.
-You want some help?
-No, thanks.
I got it.
No, I don't!
You okay?
I stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.
It's the heat.
And the humidity.
That's.
.
.
.
.
.
a tough combination.
Do you want to come in for some lemonade?
Like you wouldn't believe.
This is a great place.
Thank you.
Just make yourself comfortable.
Gotcha.
So this place is really my grandmother's.
I got it when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford it.
So if the landlord ever asks.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm an 87-year-old woman who's afraid of her vCR.
You thirsty?
You bet I am!
Okay.
.
.
.
.
.
here's your penis!
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?
You said, "You wanna come in for some lemonade"?
So?
Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
Cover yourself up!
Oh, right.
Sorry.
God, I don't believe this!
Someone asks you in for lemonade and that means they want to have sex?
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade.
Iced tea, sometimes juice.
Look, sorry.
I just-- I thought you liked me.
I'm such a jerk.
It's okay.
I suppose it could happen to anyone.
Not anyone I know, but.
.
.
.
By the way, I can still see it.
Where's your bed?
It's not in the apartment?
I can't believe this is happening again.
-What?
-Okay, enough with the third degree!
I don't live here anymore.
-What are you talking about?
-I'm sorry.
I don't live here anymore.
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.
Everybody knows?
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.
Do you know I couldn't sleep for a month.
.
.
.
.
.
because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?
You could've just turned the cushion over.
I would have, but I had a spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?
This is what I'm talking about.
I need to live in a land where people can spill!
Well, you can spill.
In the sink.
Oh, honey.
It's not your fault, you know.
This is who you are.
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.
And if I stay here, I don't see that happening.
-I love you too.
-Good.
What?
What?
I'm just sad.
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.
So what are you watching?
Baywatch.
What's it about?
Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kind of stup-- Who's she?
Nicole Eggert.
We like her.
Wow!
Look at them run!
They do that a lot.
Hey, you want a beer?
-I'll get one.
-Don't get up.
I got a cooler here.
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.
Help yourself.
You okay?
Phoebe moved out.
Right.
I don't understand.
Am I so hard to live with?
ls this why I don't have a boyfriend?
You don't have a boyfriend because.
.
.
.
I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
You should have a boyfriend.
I think so.
Come here.
Come here.
Listen, you are one of my favorite people.
.
.
.
.
.
and the most beautiful woman I've ever known in real life.
Where is everybody?
It's already closed.
Chris gave me the keys to lock up.
What is wrong?
I think my marriage.
.
.
.
.
.
is kind of over.
Oh, no!
Why?
Because Carol's a lesbian.
And I'm not one.
And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!
Oh, you poor bunny.
I'm an idiot.
I mean, I should have seen it.
I mean, Carol and I would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman.
.
.
.
.
.
and she'd be "Ross!
Look at her!
" And I'd think.
.
.
.
.
.
"God, my wife is cool.
" Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I do!
I'm sorry.
Seven years!
I mean, we've been together seven years: She's the only woman who's ever loved me.
She's the only woman I've ever.
.
.
.
This is nice.
I know.
It is, isn't it?
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.
Is it 1 00%%% cotton?
And I got it on sale too.
I should go.
One of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.
If you want to get a drink later, we can.
That sounds great.
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be-- I know.
Thanks.
Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing.
.
.
.
.
.
or I'd paid more attention.
.
.
.
.
.
or I had a uterus.
-I can't believe it.
-I know.
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.
-You're so good.
-Thanks.
And you're so sweet.
-Thanks.
-And you're kind.
Thanks.
Come here.
Wait, wait, wait.
It's okay.
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.
-What?
-I can't get it out.
That's not something a girl wants to hear.
Come on, don't start.
What?
Stupid balls are in the way.
Oh, well.
That probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.
You have chalk on your face.
You're right.
I don't know why I always thought this was real grass.
Honey, you okay?
My wife's a lesbian.
Cool!
Ross, Joey.
Joey, Ross.
I can't believe you came back.
Don't say anything.
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.
I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here.
.
.
.
.
.
right now.
You missed the exit.
Sorry.
My God, what were you thinking about?
Barry.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
So I told Carl, nobody, no matter how famous their parents are.
.
.
.
.
.
is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.
Of course, it went right in one ear.
.
.
.
I love how he cares so much about stuff.
If I squint, I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
Oh, good.
Another dinosaur story.
When are those gonna become extinct?
If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible that would be the best.
What does Rachel see in this guy?
I love Rachel.
I wish she was my wife.
Who's singing?
The One With the Race Car Bed .
:staz:.
When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days .
.
.
who were you?
I was Richie.
I was always Joanie.
Question: Was "Egg the Gellers!
" the war cry of your neighborhood?
It's the Mattress King!
Change the channel!
Wait!
I want to see this!
After I divorce him.
.
.
.
.
.
half of that kingdom is gonna be mine!
Despair fills the mattress showroom.
My Kingdom is suddenly without a Queen.
I'm so depressed l'm going to slash my prices!
Check it out!
I'm going medieval on prices!
What a wank!
I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses!
I know.
At $499 for a pillow-top queen, who cares about the divorce?
Those babies will sell themselves!
And I' m appalled for you, by the way.
I'm close!
I'm cheap!
I'm the King!
Okay, Daddy.
We'll see you tomorrow night.
Okay, bye-bye.
"We"?
--are having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night.
I hope that's okay.
Oh, shoot!
Tomorrow's not good.
I' m supposed to fall off the Empire State Building.
.
.
.
.
.
and land on a bicycle with no seat, so.
.
.
.
My father doesn't hate you.
Please.
He refers to me as "Wet-Head.
" Honey, he calls everybody by a nickname.
I know.
Just one dinner.
One night.
For me.
Please?
I just want him to love you like I do.
All right.
Well, not exactly like I do.
But if you do come to dinner.
.
.
.
.
.
I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
I'll go.
Fine.
Thank you.
Hi, Gunther.
Yeah.
We'll see.
Hey, you guys!
Guess what.
-I got a gig!
-Great!
That's why I can never be an actor.
I can't say "gig.
" I can't say "croissant.
" Oh, my God!
-What's the part?
-It's not a part.
I' m teaching Acting for Soap Operas at the Learning Extension.
Come on!
That's great!
It's my chance to give something back.
.
.
.
.
.
to the acting community.
You' re probably not allowed to sleep with your students.
I know.
I don't know, Monica.
It feels funny just being here.
If you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband.
.
.
.
.
.
it's like betraying Chandler.
Not at these prices!
You know, in England this car would be on the other side of the store.
Come here.
This is my new bed!
You gotta feel this bad boy!
Monica, it still feels so weird, you know?
Chandler's your friend.
Oh, my God!
All right, take this bed.
You can make other friends.
Good evening.
I am Mr. Tribbiani.
And I will be teaching Acting for Soap Operas.
Now.
.
.
.
.
.
on my first day as Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days Of Our Lives .
.
.
I learned one of the most important things in soap opera acting.
.
.
.
.
.
is reacting.
This does not mean acting again.
It means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.
And it goes something like this.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
By the way, before I forget.
To work in soap operas.
.
.
.
.
.
some of you will have to become more attractive.
All right, moving right along.
.
.
.
-How was teaching last night?
-Great!
You get to say stuff like.
.
.
.
.
.
"Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you.
I dismiss you.
" Oh, nice.
Oh, and I got an audition for All My Children!
It's this great part.
This boxer named Nick.
And I' m so, so right for it.
He's just like me.
Except that he's a boxer.
.
.
.
.
.
and has an evil twin.
Hear ye, hear ye!
Delivery from the Mattress King!
You Miss Geller?
Sign here.
Do I have a middle name?
All right.
Monica "Felula" .
.
.
.
.
.
Geller.
It's that bedroom there.
Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
Please, please, please don't say anything to Chandler.
-You want me to lie to him?
-Is that a problem?
Oh, hey, "Nick the boxer.
" Let's see what you got!
All right, put them up.
Hey, you' re pretty good at this.
I had to learn.
I was staying at the "Y" .
.
.
.
.
.
and some of the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
Hey, now!
And I' m bleeding.
Okay, great.
Wow!
And I' m a vegetarian!
I' m sorry.
We'll put some ice on it.
Put your head back.
-I can't see.
-I have you.
Oh, God!
Which bedroom do you want it in, Ms. Geller?
It's the compulsively neat one by the window.
Gotcha.
Hi, Daddy!
This is where they put us?
What?
There was no table in the kitchen?
-Hello, baby.
-You remember Ross.
Nice to see you again, Dr. Greene.
So!
-How's the library?
-Museum.
-What happened to the library?
-There never was a library.
I mean, there are libraries.
It's just.
.
.
.
.
.
that I've never worked at one.
You know what's really good here?
The lobster.
-Shall I just order three?
-If you' re really hungry.
It was a joke.
I made a joke.
Actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.
Who's allergic to lobster?
I guess someone that works in a library.
-It's-- -I know.
It's a museum!
You' re the only who can make a joke?
At least mine was funny.
Waiter.
We will have two lobsters and a menu.
So, Dr. Greene, how's the old boat?
They found rust.
Do you know what rust does to a boat?
Gives it a nice antique-y look?
Rust is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow, I' m sorry.
When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that.
Excuse me for a moment.
I want to say good night to the Levines before we go.
Honey, stop.
It's not that bad.
Your dad must have added wrong.
He only tipped 4%%% .
Yeah.
That's Daddy.
"That's Daddy"?
Doesn't it bother you?
You' re a waitress.
Yes, it bothers me.
If he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
-So?
-So, Ross.
.
.
.
.
.
I've bugged him about this a million times.
He won't change.
Do you really serve people sneezers?
Well, I don't.
All right, kids.
Ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Greene.
Wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
-You don't need that.
-Why not?
The carbon.
It's messy.
I mean, gets on your fingers and causes.
.
.
.
.
.
night blindness.
What is this?
Who put a 20 down here?
Oh, yeah, that would be me.
I have a problem.
I tip way too much.
Way too much.
-It's a sickness, really.
-Yeah, it is.
-We have to do something about that.
-Excuse me.
You think I' m cheap?
He didn't mean anything by that.
He really didn't.
Nothing I do means anything.
Really.
This is nice.
I pay $200 for dinner.
You put down $20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot.
You really want to be Mr. Big Shot?
Here.
I'll tell you what.
You pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot.
All right?
Well, "Mr. Big Shot" is better than "Wet-Head.
" Okay, some tricks of the trade.
Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor.
.
.
.
.
.
so if I have to cry.
.
.
.
.
.
I cut a hole in my pocket.
.
.
.
.
.
take a pair of tweezers.
.
.
.
.
.
and just start pulling.
Or let's say I want to convey.
.
.
.
.
.
that I've just done something evil.
That would be your basic I've-got-a- fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-l-like-it.
Let's say I've just gotten bad news.
Well, all I do there is try and divide 232 by 1 3.
And that's how it's done.
Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.
Class dismissed.
Hey, Mr. Trib.
Guess what?
I got an audition!
One of my students got an audition.
I' m so proud!
I was wondering if you'd coach me for it.
You bet!
What's the part?
Oh, it's great!
It's a role on All My Children.
Nick the boxer.
You couldn't leave it alone.
Four percent, okay?
I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
Tonight was about the two of you getting along.
Would you just see my chiropractor already?
I' m gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini-mall.
Hey, Pheebs.
What are you doing?
I' m freaking out!
Monica trusted me with something and she shouldn't have!
I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you.
Does Monica still turn the lights on in her room?
I am so dead!
Look, here's the bottom line.
This is fixable if we act fast, okay?
I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow, and you can make nice.
Honey, I have tried to make nice.
It doesn't work.
Look, I realize my father is difficult.
But that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
Sweetie, I could be the bigger man.
I could be the biggest man.
I could be a huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make a difference.
Except I could pick your father up and say, "Like me!
Like me, tiny doctor!
" Can't you just try it one more time?
For me?
For me?
One brunch is not gonna solve anything.
Face it.
We' re never gonna get along.
Well, you are just going to have to.
I've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.
I don't want to have a separate room for you too!
I'll get the bagels.
What's this?
Isn't it cool?
This is not the bed I ordered.
I know!
You must have won a contest or something.
Why is this car in my bedroom?
I' m sorry.
I wasn't looking.
.
.
.
.
.
and the store won't take it back, because you signed for it.
-When did I sign for it?
-When I was you.
It's all Joey's fault, because he left his nose open!
Did you make brownies today?
Knock, knock!
Quick!
Take off your dress.
He won't notice the bed.
I' m going for sushi.
Does anybody want--?
Somebody missed the off-ramp!
It's Monica's bed.
What?
It's a racecar!
This has always been Monica's bed.
You just noticed?
How self-involved are you?
If this bed isn't new, then how come there's plastic on the mattress?
Sometimes I have bad dreams.
Look.
.
.
.
.
.
I just saw my best friend's brain smeared across the canvas.
It's not gonna be me.
Not me.
That was good.
That was-- Tweezers?
-That was really good.
-Thanks.
Any suggestions?
You told him to play the boxer gay?
I might have said.
.
.
.
.
.
"super-gay.
" You totally screwed him over.
You' re this guy's teacher.
How could you do this?
Because the guy's so good.
And I really, really want this part.
Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.
-Hi, Daddy.
-Baby.
Dr. Greene, how are you?
Thanks for dinner last night.
Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson.
Nice hair.
What did you do, swim here?
That's it.
I can't take it anymore.
What?
He likes your hair and just wants to know how you got here.
-It's hopeless.
I' m just gonna go.
-What?
-I' m sorry.
It's just-- -Ross?
What's with the neck?
I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor.
You still going to him?
He couldn't get into med school in lxtapa!
Thank you.
That's what I keep saying.
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
Wait a minute.
His name is Dr. Bobby?
-That's his last name.
-And his first name.
He's Bobby Bobby?
It's Robert Bobby.
And excuse me.
He helps me.
-Please.
Ask her how?
-What do you need help for?
My alignment.
One leg's shorter than the other.
-Oh, my God.
-Argue with that.
My right leg is two inches shorter!
Come on, you' re just tilting!
-Her legs are fine.
-I know that.
-So why do you let her go to him?
-"Let her"?
She doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance, either.
Wait a minute.
You don't have renter's insurance?
How you gonna run after a thief, with one leg shorter than the other?
-Would you like some juice?
-I'd love some juice.
This is going so well!
Did you see us?
Did you see?
Yeah, honey.
I was standing right there.
Why don't you tell him about my mole?
Excellent!
There will come a time in each of your careers.
.
.
.
.
.
when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor.
I had such an opportunity in the recent present.
And I' m ashamed to say.
.
.
.
.
.
that I took it.
I advised a fellow actor to play a role.
.
.
.
.
.
homosexually.
We both auditioned for the part.
.
.
.
.
.
and as it turned out.
.
.
.
.
.
they.
.
.
.
They liked the stupid "gay" thing and cast him.
And now.
.
.
.
.
.
he's got a two-year contract.
.
.
.
.
.
opposite Susan Lucci.
.
.
.
.
.
the first lady of daytime television.
And me?
Me, I' m stuck here teaching a bunch of people.
.
.
.
.
.
most of whom are too ugly to even be on Tv.
I' m sorry.
I' m sorry.
Thank you.
-May I help you?
-Yes, hi.
I' m the lady who got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller.
" All right, we wanna see the King.
Nobody sees the King.
Okay.
I' m talking to the King.
Hey, you can't go back there!
Oh, my God.
Hey, watch it, lady!
Hey, good-looking.
All right, I'll leave.
My bed's so boring.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Here you go, Pheebs.
Who wants one of my special home-baked brownies?
I'll have one.
-That's okay.
-I'm not having one.
No, no.
It's just my tooth.
-All right.
-I'll have one.
So you need a dentist?
I've got a good one.
Thanks.
I have a good one too.
I just can't see him.
See, that is the problem with invisible dentists.
Why can't you go to him?
Because every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
That's so weird.
Every time I go to the dentist.
.
.
.
.
.
I look down the hygienist's blouse.
What?
First it was my Aunt Mary.
And then there was John, my mailman.
And then my cowboy friend, Albino Bob.
And all these people actually died?
Yes.
While I was in the chair.
That's why I take care of my teeth.
It's not about oral hygiene.
I floss to save lives.
Come on, you didn't kill anybody.
These people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.
It's just a coincidence.
Tell that to them.
Oh, you can't!
They're dead!
The One With the Giant Poking Device .
:staz:.
Thanks, Gunther.
Can I get a napkin too?
Oh, like you don't already have everything.
You're in pain.
Would you just go to the dentist?
Just go.
Fine.
But if you're my next victim.
.
.
.
.
.
don't come back as a poltergeist who sucks me into the Tv set.
I promise.
Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No.
No, he's not.
You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
What are you gonna do?
How are you gonna tell Chandler?
I was thinking about that.
I think the best way would be.
.
.
.
.
.
to not.
Joey, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
It'll kill him.
It'll just kill him.
Wait till I go to the dentist.
Maybe I'll kill him.
I think Naked Guy's using a hammock.
It's like a Play-Doh fat factory.
I'm going to the dentist.
So listen.
.
.
.
.
.
just be on the lookout for anything that you could fall into.
.
.
.
.
.
or that can fall on you.
.
.
: : :or: : : : All right, just look out!
And I also just want to.
.
.
.
I just want to tell you all that.
.
.
.
I have a problem.
I have to go into work for a few hours.
Some kids messed up the Homo sapien display.
What did they do?
They painted over the word "sapien," for one thing.
Then they rearranged the figures.
Let's just leave it at that.
Do you want me to watch Ben for you?
That's what I was gonna ask.
Thank you.
Wait, hello!
What about me?
You.
You want to watch Ben?
That would be great!
I just asked Monica.
.
.
.
.
.
because I know how empty her life is.
I got a science question.
If the Homo sapiens were, in fact, "homo" sapiens.
.
.
.
.
.
is that why they're extinct?
Joey, Homo sapiens are people.
Hey, I'm not judging.
Look, Benny!
Spoon!
Spoon!
Come on.
All right, you know what?
I think he's bored.
Here.
You wanna play the airplane game?
You wanna show Rachel?
Come here.
You wanna do something fun?
Okay.
You're so brave.
You're so brave!
Yes, you are.
-You're so brave.
-You're okay.
He's fine.
Let's just put him down.
Come here, babe.
Yes, you're such a good boy.
How could you do that to him?
!
Ross trusted me!
What's he gonna say?
Nothing, because we're not telling him.
-We're not?
-No.
All right, I like that.
So we're okay.
We're okay, aren't we?
No, we're not okay.
There's a bump.
What bump?
Oh, my God!
Well, push it in!
Push it in!
I cannot push it in!
Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
That's it.
I got it!
The second Ross walks in.
.
.
.
.
.
take him to your bedroom and do whatever you do.
.
.
.
.
.
that makes him go "rheeeee!
" Or.
.
.
.
.
.
we could put a hat on his head.
A hat!
Yes!
We need a hat!
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
I'll get Rainy Day Bear!
Because he'll know what to do?
Oh, my God.
You're a genius!
It's kind of sewn on.
Give it.
Give it.
It's just like a bloodbath in here today!
Hey, hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
Do you think these pearls are nice?
I'd prefer a mountain bike.
Janice's birthday's coming.
I wanna get her something special.
-Come in here with me.
-Wait!
You wanna get her something special?
Get her flowers.
Get her candy.
Get her gum.
Girls love gum.
That's a good idea.
"Dear Janice: Have a Hubba-Bubba birthday.
" I'd like to get her something serious.
You want something serious.
You know what you should do?
You should get her one of those.
.
.
.
.
.
barium enemas.
Those are dead serious.
Look, I'm gonna go in here.
And you don't buy me anything, ever!
You can't!
You can't.
You can't buy her pearls.
You just can't, you can't, you can't!
Why not?
Oh, God.
Here's the thing.
This is the thing.
Okay, the thing is-- What is the thing?
I went down to the Mattress King's showroom.
.
.
.
.
.
and I saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?
They were in his office.
She wouldn't do that.
She's with me.
I'm telling you, I saw it.
Well, you're wrong.
You're wrong.
I'm not wrong.
I wish I was.
I'm sorry.
Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now.
It makes more sense as an ensemble.
And it takes the focus off the hat.
Oh!
You're alive!
You're alive!
I promised you no one would die, didn't l?
We'll see about that.
Can I use your phone to call everyone I know?
Sure.
We have no money.
Go ahead.
Hey, you're not dead!
Okay, see you.
Monica.
Oh, my God!
He just said my name!
Did you hear that?
Monica bang!
Okay, I heard that.
Did he just say, "Monica bang"?
Oh, my God!
He's gonna rat me out!
Monica bang!
Sweetie, you need to stop saying that now.
It's no big deal.
It's not even worth mentioning.
You see?
We all do it all the time.
See?
Watch this.
Monica bang!
Everybody bang!
Ben bang!
Rachel bang!
Bang, Rachel!
Bang!
-Oh, isn't it fun?
-Look at that!
We all do it!
-Okay, I'm stopping now.
-Are you okay?
You know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
How's my Bing-a-ling?
I don't know.
You tell me.
Anything you want to tell me?
Because if you.
.
.
.
You should-- You would tell me.
Why are your eyes so wide?
You tell me.
Maybe it's because I was just fooling around with my ex.
Oh, no.
That was you!
Oh, my God!
-All right!
-How did you know?
Joey told me.
He saw you two kissing.
In the park?
No.
In his office.
How many kisses were there?
Just those two!
Why?
Why was there kissing?
There should be no kissing!
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm so, so.
.
.
.
I'm so, so sorry.
I just.
.
.
.
What happened was l. .
.
.
I can't breathe.
Can you get me a bag or something?
Here.
Here.
It's the receipt.
I'll take it.
Look, I've got to know.
Are you finished with me?
Are you finished with him?
Do you still love him?
Do you still love me?
All right, look.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna need an actual answer here, okay?
So which is it?
Him or me?
I don't know.
Okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone!
Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner.
.
.
.
.
.
if you won't tell him about our little bonking incident.
Number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery.
And number two, l-- What?
You said "number two.
" I also said "number one.
" I know.
Hey, everyone!
How's my little boy?
He's perfect.
Aren't you, Ben?
-He's never been better.
-What did you do, take him whaling?
Monica.
Oh, my God!
He just said your name!
That's great!
Good job, Ben!
Monica bang!
That's right.
That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
The curse is broken!
I called everybody I know.
.
.
.
.
.
and everyone is alive!
Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
My God, I killed another one!
The curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
Maybe he's just taking a nap.
I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.
We should call somebody.
Tell them the naked guy we stare at isn't moving?
We've got to find out if he's alive.
How are we gonna do that?
There's no way.
Well, there is one way.
His window's open.
I say.
.
.
.
.
.
we poke him.
You know how we save all those chopsticks.
.
.
.
.
.
for no reason when we get Chinese food?
Well, now we got a reason.
What?
We're fashioning a very long poking device.
All right.
Hey, what's the matter?
I talked to Janice.
Oh, my God.
Is she going back to him?
She doesn't know.
Says she loves us both.
I woke up this morning, I was in love.
I was happy!
It serves me right for buying that 1 2-pack of condoms.
And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
You know?
What would you do?
It doesn't matter what I'd do.
Come on.
Come on.
Tell me.
All right.
.
.
.
.
.
you probably won't want to hear this.
.
.
.
.
.
but if it was me, and this is just me.
.
.
.
.
.
I'd bow out.
What?
What are you talking about?
They have a kid together.
.
.
.
.
.
you know?
They're, like, a family.
And if, I don't know.
.
.
.
.
.
if there's a chance they can make that work.
.
.
.
.
.
I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way.
You okay?
You wanna come poke a nude guy?
Well, he's finally asleep.
About that bump on his head.
.
.
.
Are you sure it's a new bump?
No offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.
It's okay if he bumps his head.
Kids bump their heads all the time.
It was your first time babysitting.
You did your best.
I did!
I know.
You just have to watch them all the time.
I did!
I watched!
I watched!
I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Monica did it?
Did you notice anything weird about Ben today?
No, why?
I was just playing with him, and we were doing the "Alphabet Song" .
.
.
.
.
.
which he's good at.
But he left out "E" and "F.
" It's like they just, I don't know, fell out of his head.
Really?
Oh, and also, he's walking.
.
.
.
.
.
kind of funny.
It's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.
Yeah, he's in there, just.
.
.
.
Oh, my God!
I wrecked your baby!
I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
You jerk!
-You know how much I love that kid!
-Monica bang!
Monica bang!
I'll get the hat.
I have something to tell you.
And I want you to let me get through it.
.
.
.
.
.
because.
.
.
.
.
.
it's not gonna be easy.
I think you should go back with Gary.
I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.
You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
Whenever I'd see him, I'd always think.
.
.
.
.
.
"You're the reason.
You are why they're not together.
" And I hated that guy.
And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.
It's the right thing to do.
You're right.
Oh, God.
But before I can say goodbye.
.
.
.
.
.
there's something I really need you to know.
The way I feel about you.
.
.
.
.
.
it's like I finally understand.
.
.
.
.
.
what Lionel Ritchie's been singing about.
You know?
I mean, what we have.
.
.
.
.
.
it's like movie love.
You're my soul mate.
I can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
Then don't leave me.
What?
Forget what I said!
I was babbling!
Pick me!
No, you were right!
I gotta give my marriage another chance.
No, you don't!
I say you have to give your divorce another chance!
I'm sorry.
Don't go.
No, I gotta go.
Honey.
Honey.
-People are looking.
-I don't care.
I don't care!
Yeah, okay.
I'm leaving now.
You can't leave!
I have your shoe!
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
Rachel has those in burgundy.
Remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.
Fortunately, I have experience in that area.
Can we please focus here?
A naked man's life hangs in the balance.
I'm telling you, he's dead.
What we're about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.
Steady.
Steady.
Okay, a little higher.
Careful of the angle.
Okay, okay.
We're approaching the window.
Thread the needle.
Thread the needle.
He's alive!
He's alive!
And yet we're still poking him.
Okay, retract the device!
Retract the device!
He does not look happy.
Now he's showing us his poking device.
Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
I'll hold you close in my arms I can 't resist your charms And love Love I'll be a fool for you I'm sure You know I don 't mind Oh, you know I don 't mind Yes You mean the world to me Oh, I know I know I've found I've found In you My endless love My endless love
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Oh, come on!
It's your Thanksgiving too.
Instead of watching football, you could help.
We know.
You wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
No, you want to put them in concentric circles.
I want to do this.
Every year.
The One With the Football .
:staz:.
To the 10, to the 5.
Touchdown, Giants!
You know, for once, I am gonna try to watch one of these things.
Halftime.
Who wants to throw the ball around?
Get a little 3-on-3 going?
-That would be fun!
-Can I play too?
I've never played football, ever.
Great!
You can cover Chandler.
I don't really want to play.
You never do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Not true.
I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.
And start drinking in the morning.
Don't say I don't have goals!
You have to start getting over her, all right?
If you play, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.
If you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.
All right, I'll play.
Let's do it!
Ross?
-What?
-Wanna play football?
Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
Says who?
Your mom?
Every Thanksgiving, we used to have a touch football game.
.
.
.
.
.
called The Geller Bowl.
No, no, no.
You say that proudly!
Anyway, Ross and I were always captains.
It got kind of competitive, and one year, Geller Bowl vl.
.
.
.
.
.
I accidentally broke Ross' nose.
It was so not an accident.
She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw.
.
.
.
.
.
her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face.
.
.
.
.
.
and just kept running.
To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
You did not win the game.
The touchdown didn't count.
.
.
.
.
.
because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.
I won the game.
Yeah?
Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
There was a Geller Cup?
Yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.
But Dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.
So he took the trophy.
.
.
.
.
.
threw it in the lake.
And was the curse lifted?
Anyway.
.
.
.
.
.
Mom said we weren't allowed to play football again.
You know what?
I think we should play a game.
I mean, come on.
It's been 1 2 years.
Can I see you for a second?
Wuss!
All right, we're gonna play.
Wait.
How we gonna get there?
My mom won't let me cross the street.
Here you go.
-Let's bring it in.
-Wait.
Honey, throw it to me!
Here you go.
That almost hit me in the face!
We have to pick captains.
And then "Tenilles.
" So how do we decide that?
-Why don't we just bunny up?
-What?
-Bunny!
-Bunny!
Looks like Ross and I are captains.
I bunnied first, so I get to pick first.
Joey.
-Thank you.
-Monica!
I'm your best friend.
Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.
Sweetie, now I pick you.
You don't pick me.
You're stuck with me!
Okay.
So let's see.
Let's play from the trash can to the light post, right?
Two-hand touch.
We'll kick off.
People, listen.
I've got 28 minutes.
.
.
.
.
.
before I have to baste again.
Wow, just like in the pros.
Okay, huddle up!
-Huddle up over here!
-Wait for me!
Wait for me!
Oh, cool!
My first huddle.
So what do you guys really think of Chandler?
You know what you're doing, right?
Joey will catch it.
We'll block.
What's "block"?
-I thought you knew what you were doing.
-I thought you meant in life!
Break!
The ball is Janice.
The ball is Janice.
Son of a--!
-Come on!
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You know what?
We're just gonna throw it.
I got it!
Go, go, go!
Score!
Seven to nothing!
Honey, you okay?
Come on, let's go.
Losers walk.
Yeah?
Losers talk.
Actually, losers rhyme.
Forty-three.
.
.
.
.
.
seventy-four.
.
.
.
You wanna go shotgun?
-One Mississippi, two Mississippi.
.
.
.
-Over here!
Over here!
I almost caught it!
Great.
Now the score's seven to almost seven.
On this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay?
-Break!
-Wait.
What am I gonna do?
You?
You go long.
How long?
Until we start to look very small.
Break!
One Mississippi-- Switch!
Switch!
Switch!
Thanks for stopping our ball.
You are playing American football?
Wow!
You're, like, from a whole other country!
I'm Dutch.
Hi, I'm Joey.
I am Margha.
Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit.
You wanna play football or-- Hi, I'm Chandler.
Hello, Chandler.
Her name is Dutch and also "Margham.
" Come on, guys!
Let's go!
Second down!
-Hello?
It's third down.
-No, it's not.
It's second.
Wow.
"Wow" what?
How it just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this.
-Pulling what?
It's second down.
-Okay, it's second down.
Take all the second downs you need.
-I heard that.
-Well, I said it loud.
It is okay if I stay and watch?
-Just sit right there.
-Yeah, why don't you stick around?
-That went well.
-I think so.
I was thinking about asking her for her number.
Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself.
I was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-Janice thing.
Oh, yeah.
That.
If it means that much, I'll let you have her.
Thanks.
"Let me have her"?
You mean if you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?
I don't like to say it out loud.
.
.
.
.
.
but yeah!
We all have our strengths.
You're better with numbers and stuff.
Math?
You're giving me math?
All right, you know what?
Forget about it.
You go for the girl.
We'll see who gets her.
I want you to run a post-pattern to the left.
And, sweetie-- Yeah, I know.
Go long.
All I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
Well, you wanna just stay out there?
Can I see that for a second?
Okay, let's go.
-I got Joey!
-Hike!
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi.
Fumble!
What's the matter with you?
This is my favorite jersey.
Well, now you have two.
Hey, I am good at math!
That's it.
I was still gonna let you have her.
But now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.
I've been preparing for that my entire life!
Or something about you that's mean!
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Tie score.
We're running out of time.
Forty-two, 38, hike!
I got it!
Broken boobs!
-Pheebs, run!
-Run, Phoebe, run!
Touchdown!
Touchdown!
The buzzer buzzed.
It doesn't count.
-After the snap.
-Before the snap.
-After.
-Before.
-Does it really matter?
-Yes!
But I made a touchdown.
It was my first touchdown.
Pheebs, that's great.
Doesn't count.
-Does so count.
-Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
Oh, my God!
That's fine.
Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
Dead leg!
Okay, fine.
You want to win by cheating, go ahead.
The touchdown does count.
You win.
I won't do this again.
I wanna beat you when you can't blame it.
.
.
.
.
.
on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.
Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.
First, I don't play with cheaters.
Second of all, you know I had swollen glands!
You know what?
I think you'll play.
Oh, really?
Why's that?
Because the winner gets this.
The Geller Cup!
Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?
Okay, good.
Where the hell did you get that?
When you went to the hospital for your nose.
.
.
.
.
.
I swam into the lake and fished it out.
That cup is mine!
No, it's not.
You want it, you're gonna have to win it.
So are we not having dinner at all?
Come on, let's go.
It's time to get serious.
Huddle up.
Keep your head in the game.
It's hard, you know?
His huddle's close to the Dutch girl.
If I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?
-What are you gonna do?
-Just make sure he catches the ball.
I'll do the rest.
-Come on, you wuss!
-Okay, come on.
I got it!
Come on!
This way!
Come on!
Look out!
Tackled by a girl!
Bet you don't see that every day.
What's with the tackling?
What?
I just touched him and he went over.
Okay.
You wanna play rough?
We can play rough.
Let's get ready to rumble!
-Go, go, go!
-Get her!
Get her!
I love this game!
Where'd you get that?
I went really long.
Forty-two to 21 .
Like the turkey, Ross is done!
You got to pick first, so you got the better team.
Pathetic!
Why can't you just accept that we're winning.
.
.
.
.
.
because I'm better than you?
Oh, what a great argument.
Exhaling!
All right, I'll prove it to you.
I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.
What?
The guys against the girls?
That's ridiculous because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
Then bring it on!
Unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Fine.
Rachel, you're with Monica.
Joey, you're with me.
I can't believe you're trading me.
Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.
You're gonna let me play?
All right, then!
The game is over?
We eat now?
The game's not over.
We're switching teams.
Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.
Okay, let's play.
Let's go.
Hold on a second.
Where do Dutch people come from?
Well, the Pennsylvania Dutch come from Pennsylvania.
And the other Dutch people?
They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
Nice try.
The Netherlands is this make-believe place.
.
.
.
.
.
where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell live.
Oh, my.
Enough "geography for the insane.
" Let's play ball.
I'm not playing with this guy.
-Fine with me.
-I've had enough of this.
Let's just cut to the chase.
Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Which do I like?
Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?
Well, if I had to choose right now.
.
.
.
.
.
which, by the way, I find really weird.
.
.
.
.
.
I would have to say Chandler.
Wait a minute.
She didn't understand the question.
Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?
I'm sorry.
That is my truth.
You hear that?
That is her truth, Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her" !
I win!
You suck!
I rule all!
Mini-wave in celebration of me!
I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to "no one.
" What?
I now find you shallow.
.
.
.
.
.
and a dork.
Bye-bye.
Nice going.
You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
It doesn't matter, because she picked me.
From now on, I get the dates.
.
.
.
.
.
and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
Save the breakthroughs for therapy.
The clock is ticking.
We have no time and we are losing to girls.
We're not gonna lose to girls.
It's 42-21 !
This sucks!
I was just up by that much!
Are we playing football or what?
Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!
We have to do this.
We're playing for women everywhere.
Think about every lousy date you ever had.
Every guy who kept one eye on the Tv while you were making out.
Oh, my God.
You dated someone with a glass eye too?
Come on, okay?
This is for all womankind.
Let's kill them!
Yeah!
Kill them!
All right, I want to kill them too.
But they're boys.
You know, how are we gonna beat three boys?
A minute and a half left and we're down by two points.
Two points, ladies.
Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.
Rachel, you go long.
No, don't make me go long.
Use me.
They never cover me.
Honey, there's a reason.
I'm not lame, okay?
I can do something.
Would you let me throw?
This is my game too.
Let her throw the ball.
Sweep behind, I'll pitch it.
You throw it downfield to Phoebe.
Thank you.
-Break!
-Break!
All right, here we go.
Thirty-two, 71 , hike!
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi!
Go, go, go!
Catch it!
-I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay!
They were coming at me and I didn't know what to do.
Thirty seconds left on the timer.
So we get to take that stupid troll thing home.
Come on!
Hurry!
We're running out of time.
Huddle up!
This is our last huddle!
All right, Phoebe, get open.
Rachel.
.
.
.
.
.
go long.
Okay.
Break!
I did it!
Touchdown!
We did it!
You know?
Funny thing, actually.
The end zone starts at that pole.
So you're five feet short.
So.
.
.
.
.
.
we win!
Yes, yes, yes!
Wait, explain something, though.
If nobody tagged Rachel, then isn't the play still going?
-Let me in, let me in!
-No way!
Let go!
Let go?
!
I'm a tiny little woman!
Come on, it's Thanksgiving!
It's not important who wins or loses.
The important thing is the Dutch girl picked me!
Me, not you!
Holland loves Chandler!
Thank you, Amsterdam!
Good night!
We should play football more often.
Maybe there's a league we could join.
Isn't there a "national football league"?
Yes, there is.
They play on Sundays and Monday nights.
Oh, shoot!
I work Monday nights.
This stuffing is amazing.
Do you think we should bring them some?
When they're hungry, they'll come in.
-Let go!
-No, you let go!
How come it's always us left holding the ball?
I don't know.
I guess the other people just don't care enough.
Hey, it's starting to snow.
-Give it to me!
Let go!
-Let it go!
Come on, let go!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
-Oh, I don't know.
-What?
Well, as old as he is in dog years.
.
.
.
.
.
do you think Snoopy should still be flying this thing?
Rachel?
Yeah?
Remember when you first came here and you got trained by another waitress?
Sure!
Do you need me to train somebody new?
Good one.
Actually, Terry wants you to take the training again.
Whenever.
Do you believe that?
Yeah.
The One Where Rachel Quits .
:staz:.
So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons.
On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
Just admit it.
You have no backhand.
Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.
Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl.
.
.
.
.
.
is not a backhand.
I was shrieking.
.
.
.
.
.
Iike a Marine.
All right, watch me execute the three P's of championship play.
Power.
.
.
.
.
.
precision.
.
.
.
.
.
and panache.
You broke a little girl's leg?
I know.
I feel horrible, okay?
It says here that a Muppet got whacked on Sesame Street last night.
Where exactly were you around 1 0-ish?
I'm going to see her.
I wanna bring her something.
-What would she like?
-A Hello Kitty doll?
The ability to walk?
I'm gonna get back to retraining.
All right.
See you, guys.
Look out, kids!
He's coming!
I gotta go sell Christmas trees.
Have fun.
Oh, wait!
No, don't!
I forgot.
I am totally against that now.
What?
Me having a job?
No, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime.
.
.
.
.
.
and their corpses grotesquely dressed.
.
.
.
.
.
in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.
How do you sleep at night?
Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around.
You got this all wrong.
Those trees were born to be Christmas trees.
They're fulfilling their life purpose by making people happy.
Really?
Yes!
Yes, and the trees are happy too.
.
.
.
.
.
because for most of them, it's their only.
.
.
.
.
.
chance to see New York.
After you deliver the drinks, take the tray-- Gunther, please.
I have worked here for two and a half years.
I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here?
That's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.
You should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do.
That's why they call it the tray spot.
I heard them talk about that.
I just thought it was a club they went to.
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.
Sweetheart.
So this must be kind of neat for you, huh?
Your dad tells me you get school off.
.
.
.
.
.
and you don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.
Whoever sells the most wins a trip to Space Camp.
.
.
.
.
.
and gets to sit in a real shuttle.
You really like all this space stuff, huh?
My dad says if I'd spend as much time helping him clean apartments.
.
.
.
.
.
as I do daydreaming about outer space.
.
.
.
.
.
he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
You'd have to clean a lot of apartments to go all the way to lndia.
No.
The one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.
He says he'll double the college money Grandma left me.
Well, good luck to Dad.
Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
The girl who won last year sold 475.
So far, I've sold 75.
Four hundred, huh?
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?
Five dollars a box.
And what is second prize?
A 1 0-speed bike.
But I'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell.
Well, that makes sense.
Could you do me one favor?
Yeah, Sarah.
Anything.
Could you pull the curtains open?
The shuttle astronauts are gonna be on the news.
We don't have a Tv, so the lady across the alley.
.
.
.
.
.
said she'd push hers up to her window so I can watch it.
Yes?
Hi.
I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
You're no Brown Bird.
I can see you through my peephole.
Hi.
I'm an honorary Brown Bird.
What does that mean?
It means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleepovers.
I can dial 91 1 at the press of a button, you know.
Now, go away!
Please, please.
It's for a poor little girl.
.
.
.
.
.
who wants to go to Space Camp more than anything in the world.
I'm pressing.
A policeman is on his way.
Okay, okay!
I'm going, I'm going.
I can still see you!
All right!
-What are you doing here?
-I thought a lot about what you said.
.
.
.
.
.
and I realize maybe I was a little judgmental.
Yeah.
Oh, but, oh.
Now, now, Phoebe, remember.
.
.
.
.
.
they're just fulfilling their Christmas-- -Destiny.
Yes.
-Sure.
That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
That's one of the old ones.
He's just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back?
That is so ageist.
We're making room for the fresh ones.
So what happens to the old guys?
They go into the chipper.
I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds.
These are shaped like Christmas characters.
Santa, Rudolph and Baby Jesus.
I'll take a box of the cream-filled Jesuses.
One box?
I'm trying to send a little girl to Space Camp.
I'm putting you down for 5 boxes.
What about you?
All right.
Do you have any coconut-flavored deities?
No, but there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.
I'll put you down for 8 boxes.
One for each night.
Mon?
I'll take a box of the Mint Treasures.
One, and that's it.
I gained weight after I joined the Brown Birds.
Remember?
Dad bought every one of my boxes and I ate them all.
No, Mon.
Dad had to buy every one of your boxes.
.
.
.
.
.
because you ate them all.
But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.
Why don't I put you down for 3 Mint Treasures and a couple of Rudolphs?
No.
Oh, come on, now.
You know you want them.
Don't do this.
I'll tell you what, I'll give you the first box for free.
Oh, God!
I gotta go!
Come on!
All the cool kids are eating them.
And later, I'll show you why we don't just trap spiders.
.
.
.
.
.
under coffee mugs and leave them there.
I'm training to be better at a job that I hate.
My life officially sucks!
Wasn't this supposed to be temporary?
You wanted to do fashion stuff.
Yeah, I'm still pursuing that.
How, exactly, are you pursuing that?
Other than sending out resumes, like, what?
Two years ago?
Well, I'm also sending out.
.
.
.
.
.
good thoughts.
If you ask me, as long as you got this job.
.
.
.
.
.
you got nothing pushing you to get another one.
You need The Fear.
-The Fear?
-He's right.
Quit this job, and you'll have motivation to go after a job you really want.
Why are you still at a job you hate?
Why don't you quit and get The Fear?
Because I'm too afraid.
I don't know.
I'd give anything to work for a designer or a buyer.
I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
Can't I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.
Okay, fine.
Gunther, you know what?
I am a terrible waitress.
Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.
I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf.
I don't care where the tray spot is.
I just don't care.
This is not what I want to do.
So I don't think I should do it anymore.
-I'm giving my week's notice.
-What?
Gunther, I quit.
Does this mean we have to start paying for coffee?
Okay, 1 2.
Twenty-two.
Eighteen.
What?
I spelled out "boobies" .
Put me down for another box of the Mint Treasures, okay?
Where are the Mint Treasures?
We're out.
I sold them all.
What?
Monica, I'm cutting you off.
Just a couple more boxes.
It's no big deal, all right?
I'm cool.
You gotta help me with a couple more boxes!
Look at yourself.
You have cookie on your neck.
Oh, God!
-So how many you sold so far?
-Check this out.
-Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
-Oh, my God!
How did you do that?
The other night I was leaving the museum.
.
.
.
.
.
just as Laser Floyd was letting out of the planetarium.
Without even trying, I sold 50 boxes!
That's when it occurred to me.
The key to my success: The munchies.
So I started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight.
I am selling cookies by the case.
They call me "Cookie Dude" !
Stop what you're doing.
I need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers.
.
.
.
-Who did these resumes for you?
-Me.
On my computer.
Yeah.
Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse" .
.
.
.
.
.
and "Cheer Squad Co-Captain" only took up so much room.
Hey, that's funny!
You're funny, Chandler!
You're a funny guy!
You know what else is funny?
Something else I might have said?
I don't know.
Weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job.
.
.
.
.
.
when I had absolutely nothing else to do?
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.
No, it's not gonna be okay.
Tomorrow is my last day.
.
.
.
.
.
and I don't have a lead.
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Gunther.
.
.
.
.
.
and tell him I'm not quitting.
You don't want to give in to The Fear.
You and your stupid Fear!
I hate your Fear!
I would like to take you and your Fear-- Hey!
I got great news!
Run, Joey!
Run for your life!
What?
Rach, listen.
Have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
My dad's got a plumbing job there and he heard there's an opening.
You want him to get you an interview?
Oh, my God, yes!
I would love that!
That's so sweet, Joey.
Not a problem.
And now, for the great news.
That wasn't the great news?
Only if you think it's better than this.
Snow-in-a-Can!
You want me to decorate the window?
Give it kind of a Christmas looky?
Christmas cookie?
Okay, and this one here's a Douglas fir.
Now, it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.
Looks good.
I'll take it.
Wait, wait.
No, no!
You don't want that one!
No, no.
You can have this cool brown one.
It's almost dead.
That's why you have to buy it, to fulfill its Christmas destiny.
Otherwise, they'll throw it into the chipper.
Tell him.
Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill their Christmas destiny.
.
.
.
.
.
are thrown in the chipper.
I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
You gotta stop doing this.
I'm working on commission here!
I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Well, look no further!
This one's yours!
Is this the one that I threw out last year?
Never mind!
Everybody wants a green one!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get so emotional.
The holidays are just hard.
Oh, honey.
Is that because your mom died around Christmas?
I wasn't even thinking about that.
Hi there.
How many did you sell?
I'm not gonna tell you.
You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
Hey, now.
That was an accident, okay?
You're a big scrud.
What's a scrud?
Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud?
I don't have to.
I can just look at you.
All right, girls.
.
.
.
.
.
and man.
Let's see your final tallies.
Debbie.
Three hundred and twenty-one boxes of cookies.
very nice.
Not nice enough.
Charla.
Two hundred and seventy-eight.
Sorry, dear, but still good.
Good for a scrud.
Yes, Elizabeth.
Eight hundred and seventy-one.
That's crap!
Sister Brown Bird.
Good going.
Who's next?
-Hi there.
-Hi.
And batting for Sarah.
.
.
.
.
.
Ross Geller.
Eight hundred and seventy-two.
Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
That is because my doctor says that I have.
.
.
.
.
.
a very serious.
.
.
.
.
.
nougat.
.
.
.
.
.
deficiency.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
I lost.
Some little girl loaned her uniform to her 1 9-year-old sister.
.
.
.
.
.
who went down to the U. S. S. Nimitz and sold over 2000 boxes.
-How'd the interview go?
-Oh, I blew it.
I wouldn't have even hired me.
Come here, sweetie.
Listen.
.
.
.
.
.
you're gonna go on, like, That's not how that was supposed to come out.
This is just the worst Christmas ever.
Maybe you should just stay here at the coffeehouse.
I can't.
It's too late.
Terry already hired that girl over there.
Look at her.
She's even got waitress experience.
Last night she was.
.
.
.
.
.
teaching everybody how to make.
.
.
.
.
.
napkins.
.
.
.
.
.
into.
.
.
.
That word was "swans.
" Well, seeing that drunk Santa wet himself really perked up my Christmas.
Oh, my God!
Merry Christmas!
You saved them!
You guys!
Oh, God, you're the best!
Looks like Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.
Yeah, this is she.
You're kidding!
You're kidding!
Oh, thank you!
I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.
I got the job!
That's great.
God bless us, everyone!
Here we go.
I'm serving my last cup of coffee.
There you go.
Enjoy.
-Should I tell her I ordered tea?
-No.
Excuse me, everyone?
This is my last night working here.
.
.
.
.
.
and I just wanted to say.
.
.
.
.
.
that I made some good friends here.
And it's just time to move on.
And no offense to everybody who still works here.
.
.
.
.
.
but you have no idea how good it feels to say.
.
.
.
.
.
that as of this moment.
.
.
.
.
.
I will never have to make coffee again.
Now, Mr. Kaplan Sr. Iikes his coffee strong.
So you want to use two bags instead of one.
Now, pay attention.
This part's tricky.
See, some people use filters just once.
.
.
.
I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Space Camp.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm hoping that maybe somehow this may help make up for it.
Okay?
Presenting.
.
.
.
.
.
Sarah Tuddle's Private very Special Space Camp!
You don't have to do this.
Oh, come on, here we go!
Stand by for mission countdown!
Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Okay, blast off!
I'm an alien!
I'm an alien!
Oh, no!
An asteroid!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Okay, pick a card.
Any card.
All right, now memorize it.
Show it to everybody.
Got it?
All right.
Give it back to me.
Five of hearts.
Real magic does exist.
Joey, how do you do it?
I can't tell you that.
Somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
That's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
He took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.
Why don't you go ask him to just, "Step lightly, please"?
I have, like five times.
But the guy is so charming.
.
.
.
.
.
I go up there to yell, then I end up apologizing to him.
That is silly!
I'll go up and tell him to keep it down.
-All right, be my guest.
-Good luck.
All right, all right.
.
.
.
.
.
if you wanna know how I did it, I'll show you.
When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was.
.
.
.
.
.
I looked at it so fast, it was invisible to the naked eye.
I just did it.
Just did it again.
Here, I'll slow it down so you guys can see it.
Ready?
-I got it now!
-Okay.
Thank you.
The One Where Chandler Can't Remember Which Sister .
:staz:.
Anybody got a length of rope about -Honey, what's the matter?
-I just saw Janice.
She was at Rockefeller Center, skating with her husband.
She looked so happy.
I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
I remember the first time I saw Katherine after we broke up.
She was walking and talking with her friend, Donna.
God, it killed me!
But you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
Sorry, I just-- Any excuse to tell that story.
There's a party tomorrow.
You'll feel better then.
I'm gonna be okay.
You don't have to throw a party for me.
It's Joey's birthday.
Then if anybody should have a party, it should be him.
I cannot believe she's still up there.
Well, he totally screwed up the punch line.
You know, it's supposed to be-- How's that coffee coming, dear?
Right away, Mr. Kaplan.
I'm not suppose to drink it.
It makes me gassy.
I know.
I'll bet you're thinking, "What's an intelligent girl.
.
.
.
.
.
who wants to be in fashion doing making coffee"?
You got me.
Don't think I haven't noticed your potential.
I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion.
-How does that sound?
-That sounds great!
-Come on over here, sweetheart.
-Thank you so much.
I need these hangers separated ASAP.
You're welcome.
Oh, God, I hate my job!
I hate it.
I know, honey.
I'm sorry.
I want to quit, but then I think I should stick it out.
Then I think: "Why would a person stay in such a demeaning job.
.
.
.
.
.
just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?
Gee, I don't know, Rach.
Order up!
Yentl soup, James Beans, and a Howdy, hold the Doody.
Come on, I'm sorry.
I didn't-- I don't mind paying my dues.
But how much will I learn about fashion.
.
.
.
.
.
by walking Myra, the arthritic seamstress.
.
.
.
.
.
to the bathroom?
Hi.
Is my misery amusing to you?
I'm sorry, I was just.
.
.
.
It's not funny.
This is actually my job.
Believe me, I've been there.
I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
I'm just gonna go back to talking to my friend here.
You can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
Just one other thing.
I work at Bloomingdale's.
I might know of a possible job, if you're interested.
Do you want my pickle?
Hey, guys.
-Hey, Gunther.
-Hi.
You're going on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Well, he's very charming.
He's too charming!
But if you go out, it'll be harder for me to hate him.
You'll just have to try.
Joey?
Where are the Jell-O shots?
I don't know.
Chandler's supposed to be passing them-- Chandler!
Hello-dee-lo!
Well, somebody's feeling better.
-Stick out your tongue!
-Take off your shirt!
-Oh, my!
-Oh, my God!
How many did you have?
They're pure vodka.
Yeah, Jell-O.
Just like Mom used to make.
The most unbelievable thing happened today.
I had lunch at Monica's and met a guy.
.
.
.
.
.
who works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's.
There's an opening there!
So I gave him my phone number.
.
.
.
.
.
and he'll call me this weekend to get me an interview!
So this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?
And he's a total stranger?
Yeah.
His name is "Mark" something.
Sounds like "Mark Something" wants to have some sex!
What?
Why else would he swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?
To be nice?
Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
-No, only for sex.
-Thank you.
So did you tell "Mark Something" about me?
I didn't have to.
I was wearing.
.
.
.
.
.
my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Joey!
Happy birthday!
How many of that girl are you seeing?
How hammered are you?
These are Joey's sisters.
Hi, Joey's sisters!
What're we drinking over here?
Well, I have a vodka and cranberry juice.
No kidding?
That's the same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
What are you doing?
I'm taking my ex-girlfriend off my speed dialer.
No, it's a good thing.
Why must we dial so speedily anyway?
Why rush through life?
Why can't we savor the precious moments?
You have some huge breasts!
-Hi.
-Hi.
So I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.
Isn't it great?
Yeah, pretty good.
He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Oh, he is.
And he is so dreamy!
I mean, when he left, I actually used the phrase: "Hummina, hummina, hummina.
" That's excellent.
So he's "just a nice guy.
" Do you really think this Mark doesn't want anything for helping you?
Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.
But that's true of any job.
How you feeling?
Well, my apartment isn't there anymore.
.
.
.
.
.
because I drank it.
Where'd you go?
We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
No "woo-hooing.
" No "woo-hooing.
" Why, what happened?
I fooled around with Joey's sister.
That's not the worst part.
What is the worst part?
I can't remember which sister.
You see what men do?
Don't tell me men are nice.
This is men!
Are you insane?
Joey will kill you.
He'll actually kill you dead.
You don't think I thought of that?
-How can you not know which one?
-That's unbelievable.
-Was it Gina?
-Which one's Gina?
The dark, big hair, with airplane earrings.
That's Dina, not Gina.
See?
You can't tell which is which either!
We didn't fool around with any of them.
It's got to be veronica.
The girl in the red skirt.
I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat!
That was me.
When I drink, sometimes I get overly friendly.
.
.
-.
.
.
and I'm sorry.
-That's okay.
-That's all right.
-That's okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Joey!
Come on.
Why can't we talk in here.
.
.
.
.
.
with witnesses?
I just got off the phone with my sister.
Which one?
-Mary Angela.
-Mary Angela.
Now which one is she again?
Ask Chandler.
He fooled around with her.
She told me you said you could really fall for her.
Is that true, or are you just getting over Janice by groping my sister?
It's gotta be the first one.
Really?
That's great!
You and my sister, sitting in a tree!
Yep, I'm in a tree.
Did he call?
Did Mark call?
I'm sorry.
But the weekend's not over yet.
Oh, my God!
ls that Phoebe?
Guess they're back from their date.
Music!
very nice!
Oh, my God!
So how are you?
-I am good.
I finished my book.
-What's it about?
I don't remember.
Do you want to take a walk?
"Dear Mary Angela: Hi, how's it going?
This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write.
" What the hell's the matter with you?
How will Joey react to you blowing off his sister with a letter?
That's where you tell him that I moved to France.
.
.
.
.
.
when actually I'll be in Cuba.
Look, you've got to do this yourself in person.
You know her name.
You just go to the house and ask for Mary Angela.
When whichever one she is comes to the door.
.
.
.
.
.
take her for a walk and let her down easy.
What if she comes to the door and I ask for her?
Where in Cuba?
What are you doing here?
Waiting for my grandma to do my laundry.
What about you?
I'm here to see Mary Angela.
You are so the man!
Come on.
Now look, listen.
Listen.
.
.
.
Be cool, because Grandma doesn't know about you two.
You don't want to tick her off.
She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
Where's Mary Angela?
She's right in there.
-Hey, Chandler!
-Hey, Chandler!
I can't believe Mark didn't call.
It's Sunday night and he didn't call.
Bummer.
Yeah, right.
Look at you.
You're practically giddy.
I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out.
Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Wait a minute.
Why don't you just call Mark?
Who says you have to sit and wait for him?
You've got to make stuff happen!
Yeah, but you don't wanna seem too pushy.
It's not pushy.
He gave her his home number.
He gave you his home number, as in, to his home?
And you don't mind if I call, because you want good things for me.
That's right, good things.
That is what I said.
Mark?
Hi, it's Rachel Greene.
Oh, no.
Don't you apologize.
Yeah, I'll hold.
He left my number at work.
Then he had to help his niece with her report on the pioneers.
That is so made up!
Oh, my God!
Tomorrow?
That's-- No, it's perfect.
Oh, God!
Thank you so much!
Great.
I got the interview!
There you go!
He even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it.
That is amazing!
Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do.
.
.
.
.
.
I'd expect nothing less.
I gotta figure out what to wear.
High collar and baggy pants say, "I'm a pro!
" Yeah, right.
Okay, I'll see you guys later.
You go get them!
What did I do to you?
Did I hurt you in some way?
What?
"Why don't you call him"?
Thank you very much.
Now he's gonna prep her.
.
.
.
.
.
as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend!
Are you crazy?
Am l?
Am I out of my mind?
Am I losing my senses?
This dreamy guy's taking my girlfriend out for a meal!
This isn't even about you!
It's about something wonderful happening for Rachel.
Even if you're right, and he wants to sleep with her.
.
.
.
.
.
does that mean he gets to?
-No, but-- -Don't you trust her?
Then get over yourself!
Grow up!
You grow up.
This tiramisu is excellent.
Did you make it, Mary Angela?
No, I did.
Well, it's yummy.
So.
.
.
.
Mary Angela, do you like it?
Of course.
It's her favorite.
So.
.
.
.
Mary Angela, what's your second favorite?
More of Grandma's tiramisu.
Oh, would you just please.
.
.
.
.
.
give me your recipe, because this is great!
It's topnotch!
That dies with me.
So will l. Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.
I was just squinting.
It doesn't mean anything.
Just do it!
Will you excuse me, I have to.
.
.
.
Finally!
I thought we'd never be alone.
Can I just tell you something?
I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.
I just got out of a relationship.
And I'm not really in a. .
.
.
.
.
in a commitment kind of place.
So?
Me neither!
God, Mary Angela was right.
You do have the softest lips.
You're not Mary Angela?
No!
I'm Mary Therese!
This is so bad.
If you're not Mary Angela, then who is?
I am.
Oh, it's so bad.
No, Joey!
No, Joey!
What's going on?
You're it!
Now run and hide!
It's no big deal.
Chandler was just kissing me.
.
.
.
.
.
because he thought I was Mary Angela.
What?
How could you think she was Mary Angela?
I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was.
Look, I'm sorry.
I was really drunk.
.
.
.
.
.
and you guys all look really similar.
-I say punch him, Joey!
-Yeah, punch him!
We should all calm down.
.
.
.
.
.
because your brother's not gonna punch me.
Are you?
That's usually what I'd do.
But I never thought you'd be on the receiving end.
How could you do this?
If you wanna punch me, go ahead.
I deserve it.
But I want you to know that I'd never soberly hurt you or your family.
You're my best friend.
And I'd never do anything like this, ever again.
So what?
-I say punch him!
-Yeah, punch him!
No, I'm not gonna punch Chandler.
-I'll do it.
-No, you won't!
He knows he did a terrible thing, and I believe him.
He's sorry.
But you got one more apology to make.
You gotta apologize to Mary Angela.
-Absolutely.
You got it.
-All right.
-Cookie, now you can punch him!
-What?
What are you doing here?
You know, this building's on my paper route, so.
.
.
.
How did it go?
The woman I interviewed with was pretty tough.
.
.
.
.
.
but thank God Mark coached me.
Once I talked about the Fall line, she got all happy.
-I'm so proud of you.
-Me too!
Listen, I'm.
.
.
.
I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and.
.
.
.
It's just, I like you a lot, so.
.
.
.
I know.
-Hi.
-Hi, Mark.
I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you.
You got the job.
I did?
Oh, my God!
Congratulations.
.
.
.
So, Phoebe?
How was your date?
Oh, well, you know.
.
.
.
Yeah, I do know.
You were eavesdropping?
Eavesdropping?
Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But I really like this guy and I think he really likes me.
Maybe he's just.
.
.
.
.
.
jumping on a pogo stick and he really likes it.
Maybe the pogo stick likes it too.
All right, that's it.
He cannot do this to Phoebe!
This guy's gonna get the butt-kicking of a lifetime!
But is he a big guy?
We'll all go.
Come on.
Thanks, you guys.
Thank you!
Don't worry!
God!
I hope they kick his ass!
Honey, I'm sorry.
If it's any consolation.
.
.
.
.
.
he sounded like he had more fun with you.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
-Does everybody hate these shoes?
-Yeah.
But nobody will focus on that if you wear that towel-dress.
Tell him.
It's her first day at this new job.
You shouldn't start with her.
All right.
I suppose I can wait a day.
-What are you doing Friday?
-Why?
Come to my weird cousin Albert's bachelor party.
You know, he's the botanist?
Oh, God!
Botanists are such geeks.
Is that a dinosaur tie?
Morning!
Rach, I'm here with the purses!
It must take you forever to find your keys.
Thank you, Pheebs.
You're welcome.
Please want the one with the turtles.
No, turtles scare me.
I don't need that today.
Honey, just relax.
It's gonna be fine.
Why don't I come and take you to lunch?
Thank you!
But Mark's taking me out.
Mark?
ls that the same Mark that helped you get the job?
It's like a "good luck on your first day" thing.
Is this a lunch box?
No, a purse.
And there's a thermos in it.
-So can you make it on Friday?
-What?
I think so.
Why am I invited to this again?
Apparently, Albert has no friends.
He's excited about the bachelor party.
He's only getting married so he can see a stripper.
A stripper at a bachelor party.
That is so clichÃ©.
Why don't you guys get a magician?
If he can open my beer with his butt-cheeks, then all right.
The One With All the Jealousy .
:staz:.
She's having lunch with him?
Lunch with him?
You should've seen him hug her when she got the job!
And he's really good-looking.
-What am I gonna do?
-You don't do anything.
Keep it inside.
Learn how to hide your feelings.
Don't cry out loud.
Guess who has an audition for a Broadway musical?
I wanna say you, but it seems like such an easy answer.
It is me!
It's a musical version of A Tale of Two Cities.
So I think I'm gonna sing "New York, New York" .
.
.
.
.
.
and "I Left My Heart in San Francisco.
" Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
What?
Mr. Dickens gets to pick them.
Who?
I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
The what?
The abridgment.
The what?
Then the style number.
.
.
.
.
.
the invoice number and the shipping date.
Good.
Any questions so far?
What kind of discount do we get?
Twenty percent.
I love this job!
-My first call!
-Here, let me.
Rachel Greene's line.
May I help you?
Hi, is Rachel there?
-And who may I say is calling?
-This is Ross.
Ross of.
.
.
?
Of "Ross and Rachel.
" Hi, it's Mark.
-Hey, Mark.
-Hey.
Hold on a second.
It's Ross.
Hi, honey.
What's Mark doing answering your phone?
Oh, he's just goofing around.
Oh, that's funny.
Why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
This is his office too.
I told you, we're Joanna's two assistants.
Why does Joanna need two assistants?
How lazy is she?
Oh, my God!
What did I just do?
I just shipped 3000 bras to Personnel!
I gotta go!
Mark, I need you!
Okay!
Bye-bye!
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was just trying to-- I was dialing another number.
I got changed in 30 seconds so you could be alone with him.
You better go for it.
I'm not going for anything.
Well, if you don't, I will.
Would you please go?
'Night, Mon.
'Night, Julio.
Someone left their book here.
Actually, that is mine.
What are you reading?
Flowers of Evil, by Baudelaire.
Have you read it?
Have I read it?
No.
Are you enjoying it?
I thought I would, but the translation's no good.
You're a poet and you don't know it.
Actually, l. .
.
.
I am a poet.
So you do know it.
So what kind of things do you write about?
Things that move me: The shadow of a tree.
.
.
.
.
.
a child laughing.
.
.
.
.
.
or this lip.
Mine?
Right here?
I could write an epic poem about this lip.
How would that go?
Well, it didn't rhyme.
.
.
.
.
.
but I liked it.
You've got to pick a pocket or two boys You've got to pick a pocket or two Lovely.
Just lovely.
Really?
Thanks.
We definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Excellent!
I'll be there.
Don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
My agent said that it wasn't a dancing part.
All the roles gotta dance a little.
But with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.
"Three years of modern dance with Twyla Tharp"?
"Five years with the American Ballet Theatre"?
Everybody lies on their rÃ©sumÃ©, okay?
I wasn't one of the Zoom kids either.
Well, can you, like, dance at all?
Yeah, I can dance.
You know.
.
.
.
What is that?
Sure, it looks stupid now.
There's no music playing.
I have to get that.
But, no, no.
Hi.
Listen, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that.
Let me ask you this.
What do you do for the extra hundred?
So would I have to provide the grapes?
Hi.
How was last night with Julio, se~norita?
It was amazing.
He's sexy and smart, which makes him even sexier.
Last night we were fooling around.
.
.
.
.
.
and all of a sudden he stops to write a poem.
Get out!
I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
We have our stripper, a "Miss Crystal Chandelier.
" Name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
But he forgot to take the poem with him.
I am totally dense about poetry, but I think this is pretty good.
Check it out.
"The Empty vase.
Translucent beauty--" To yourself.
You know, that's pretty good.
Yeah, I think so too.
Phoebe?
Great!
I'm so glad you guys like it!
-I gotta go to work.
-I'm not done.
Give it back when you're through.
-See you guys.
-Bye-bye.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Poor Monica!
What?
What?
What?
He was with her when he wrote this poem!
"My vessel so lovely, with nothing inside"?
"Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still"?
He thinks Monica's empty.
She's the empty vase!
You really think he meant that?
Totally.
Oh, God!
And she seems so happy too.
Done.
Do you have the Ralph Lauren file?
Oh, yeah, sure!
It's right-- What's that?
It's from Ross.
It's a Love Bug.
Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
That's not what he's doing.
He's just really romantic.
Excuse me.
Are you Rachel Greene?
One, two, three.
Congratulations on your first week At your brand-newjob It won 't be long Before you're the boss And you know who will be there To support you Your one and only boyfriend It's nice to have a boyfriend!
Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross!
I'm hurt!
I'm actually hurt.
.
.
.
.
.
that you'd think I'd send those things out of anything but love.
Hurt!
All right, I get it.
You're hurt!
Can't a guy send a barbershop quartet.
.
.
.
.
.
to his girlfriend's office anymore?
Oh, please!
It was so obvious.
.
.
.
.
.
Iike you were marking your territory.
You might as well have just come in and peed around my desk!
I would never do that.
Look, I know what's going on here.
Mark explained it all to me.
He said this is what you guys do.
Well, if Mark said that, then Mark's an idiot.
Mark's a genius.
Why?
How?
How is he a genius?
Don't you see what's happening?
Instead of hitting on her now, he's becoming her confidante.
Now he's gonna be the guy she goes to, to complain about you.
What am I gonna do?
Why don't you send her a musical bug?
No, you already did that.
You're gonna have to go there yourself now.
Make a few surprise visits.
I don't know, guys.
Fine, don't do anything.
Sit and talk to us.
Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you.
And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive.
She's thinking, "Maybe he's the guy for me because he understands me.
" And before you know it, she's with him.
And you'll be all, "Oh, man!
" And he'll be all, "Yes!
" And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude!
" And pretty soon you'll be like: "Hi.
" And, "Well, I can't go.
Rachel and Mark might be there.
" And we'll be like, "Man, get over it!
It's been four years!
" He paints quite a picture, doesn't he?
Here's the Shelley Segal stuff for December.
Wait, I've got something for you.
It's okay.
Rachel knows.
Yeah, but even so-- I can't help it.
I'm just crazy about you.
Oh, that is so sweet!
I know I'm Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough.
I see you walking around, and I want to touch and hold you.
.
.
.
Come on, no one's around.
Just kiss me.
All right, that's it!
Get off of her!
What is going on?
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on!
I have been down in your store for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.
What do I have to do to get some service?
Hi, Rach.
Joey Tribbiani?
I've got a problem.
I just got a call from my dance captain.
He's having a relationship crisis and can't leave Long lsland.
Does that mean the audition's off?
Seeing as you've got the most experience.
.
.
.
.
.
I want you to teach these dancers the combination.
What?
Come on, it's easy.
You know, it's hand, hand.
.
.
.
.
.
head, head.
.
.
.
.
.
up, pas de bourrÃ©e, pas de bourrÃ©e.
.
.
.
.
.
big turn here, rond de jambe.
.
.
.
Slide, step, step.
.
.
.
.
.
and jazz hands!
So that's, "Steppity-step and jazz hands.
" Have fun.
Bye.
What are you wrapping?
Look what I got Julio.
It's a vase.
Just like the one in the poem.
Not exactly like the one in the poem.
What do you mean?
Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?
So I'm just an empty vase?
What?
So, I don't read as many important books as you do.
And I don't write trick poems that aren't about what they seem.
And I get excited about stupid stuff.
.
.
.
.
.
Iike when my People magazine comes.
.
.
.
.
.
and the new "Hold Everything" catalog.
But that doesn't mean I'm empty.
I care about things.
Friends and family.
You have no right to judge me!
You don't even know me!
The poem is not about you.
What?
"The Empty vase" is not about you.
My baby preciosa.
You make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry.
It's.
.
.
.
My friend Phoebe said-- It's about all women.
Well.
.
.
.
.
.
all American women.
You feel better now?
All right, let's do it.
What was that?
It's the best I could get out of them.
Well, people!
People, people, people!
Let's try it again.
And this time, everybody watch Joey.
Show 'em how it's done.
Count it off, Mack.
Did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
Look what I got!
See, she's dressed, right?
And then you click it, and uh-oh, she's naked!
And then you click it again and she's dressed.
She's a business woman walking down the street.
She's window shopping, and oh, she's naked!
I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
I'm sorry.
I was an idiot.
A big idiot.
A big idiot.
It's just, you have to realize.
.
.
.
.
.
this Mark thing is hard for me.
Why is it hard?
We've been together for almost a year now.
Well, I was with Carol for, like, eight years.
And I lost her.
And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.
So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna.
.
.
.
.
.
well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.
Let it be me.
Let it be me!
Honey, that's very sweet.
It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other.
.
.
.
.
.
and trust each other, like we do.
.
.
.
.
.
there's no reason to be jealous.
I gotta get going.
Bye, Chandler.
This pen's getting kind of boring.
Can you pick me up some porn?
Where you going?
I've gotta go pick up Ben for a play-date this afternoon.
With who?
Just this woman I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at--?
The stripper?
You have a play-date with a stripper?
Man, I gotta get a kid!
We started talking after she did her thing.
.
.
.
.
.
and she's got a boy about Ben's age.
So we're gonna take the kids to a Gymboree class.
-Is that okay?
-Sure.
Is she married?
Are you jealous?
I just don't see why she has to play with you.
I mean, doesn't she have any other stripper-mom friends of her own?
You are totally jealous!
I'm not jealous.
This is about.
.
.
.
.
.
people feeling certain things.
.
.
.
.
.
you know, about.
.
.
.
.
.
strippers.
And, you know.
.
.
.
I love you too.
Bye.
Wait, wait, wait!
What?
Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours.
Either that or you just turned him on and sent him to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?
I am Julio.
Mr. Pretentious You think there's no one finer Your poems are unpublished And you work in a diner You're no God's gift to women That's all in your head You are just a butt-munch No one likes a butt-munch!
And you're also bad in bed
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Six dollars, please.
Six?
I just had it for one night.
It's three.
Eight o'clock's the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.
You know, in a weird way, you have too much power.
You have to help me because I only have three.
I can help with that.
Oh, my God.
Richard?
Your lip went bald.
Thanks.
You look great!
Right.
No, you do.
You.
.
.
.
What?
You got panties stuck to your leg.
I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and static cling.
Or maybe God knew I'd be running into you and saw an opportunity.
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
The One Where Monica and Rich are Just Friends .
:staz:.
See that guy?
He's in "Classics" now.
.
.
.
.
.
but as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.
He'll go to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
This is nice.
-I miss this.
-Me too.
You want to get a hamburger or something?
I don't know if that's a good idea.
Just friends.
I won't grope you.
I promise.
I think it's too soon.
No, it's not too soon.
I had lunch at 1 1 .
Yeah, baby!
-What are you making?
-Chocolate milk.
Want some?
No, thanks.
I'm 29.
Oh, my God!
I gotta go to work!
What time will you get off tonight?
It could be really late.
Not again!
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'll make a deal with you, okay?
Every night that you're asleep before I get home.
.
.
.
.
.
I will wake you up in a way that has proved popular in the past.
Well, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?
Since tomorrow.
I met a cute guy in the park.
And he jogs and blades and swims and so we made a deal.
He's gonna teach me how to do jock stuff.
-And what are you gonna do for him?
-I'm gonna let him.
Cool.
Good morning.
Somebody got in late last night.
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.
When did this happen?
Around 8:02.
We talked for a while, and then we went out for an innocent burger.
There's no such thing as an "innocent burger.
" -Gonna see him again?
-Tomorrow night.
Monica, what are you doing?
She spent six months getting over him.
.
.
.
.
.
and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
It's not a date, okay?
I'm teaching him how to make a lasagna for a potluck dinner.
You might want to make extra, because you'll be hungry after the sex.
We're not gonna have sex.
Nothing's changed here.
He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
So we're just gonna be friends.
Naked friends.
-Do you have any ice?
-Check the freezer.
If there's none in there, we're probably out.
Are you just getting home?
It's late.
I know.
I had the greatest day, though.
I went to a meeting with reps from Calvin Klein.
I liked a line of lingerie, so my boss ordered a ton of it.
And you?
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.
Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
I was reading it last night and I got scared, so.
.
.
.
But you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
Well, safer.
I never start reading it.
.
.
.
.
.
without making sure we got room in the freezer.
How often do you read it?
Haven't you ever read a book over and over again?
I read Little Women more than once.
It's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?
The question should be, what is not so great about The Shining?
And the answer would be, "nothing.
" All right?
This is the scariest book ever.
I bet it's better than that classic of yours.
We'll just see about that, okay?
I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
All right, you got it.
Now, Rach, these little women.
.
.
.
How little are they?
I mean, are they, like, scary little?
Chandler, Ross?
This is Robert.
You have lipstick right here.
That's okay, it's mine.
We just kissed.
Isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?
Well, I'm from California.
Right.
Sometimes you guys just burst into flame.
I'm up.
I'm up.
I've gotten up now.
Anybody want anything?
-I'll have coffee.
-Me too.
Make that three.
Ross, why don't you come with me?
What's the matter?
What's going on?
Robert's coming out.
What do you mean?
ls he gay?
He's coming out of his shorts.
What?
The man is showing brain.
Are you sure?
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
That was a coffee and a. .
.
.
Coffee.
We could write it down.
No, no.
That won't be necessary.
Well?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
Like an eclipse.
When people compliment my cooking tonight, what do I say?
You say, "Thank you.
" Then you buy me something pretty.
Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl.
.
.
.
.
.
and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
This feels very weird.
You touch people's eyeballs and this feels weird?
Sure, I touch them.
But I spent years learning not to squish them.
That's my hand.
-Keep squishing.
-The tomatoes are squishing.
You got some on your shirt.
Hold on a second.
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.
It should do.
.
.
.
.
.
the trick.
What?
You've got some on your pants.
I'll just throw them out.
These little women!
You're liking it?
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
I don't see how he could forgive her.
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?
That is the one thing missing from The Shining.
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
How'd the basketball go?
I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.
You mean a 3-pointer?
I get more because I'm dainty.
Is there a phone here to check my messages?
-In back.
Do you want a quarter?
-I always carry one in my sock.
What are you doing?
Get back on your side-- Hello!
I'm Joey.
We haven't met.
Good to meet you.
Robert.
What?
What?
You guys, what is going on?
Do you not like Robert?
Why are you laughing?
Calm down.
No reason to get testy.
-You guys!
Come on!
-We're sorry.
It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area.
.
.
.
.
.
as one may have hoped.
What do you mean?
Could you pass me those cookies?
Sure.
So how'd the lasagna go over?
Really?
Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.
I've been thinking about you too.
Well, no.
It's hard, this "platonomy" thing.
It's a word.
I do think it's better this way.
We're being smart.
Yes, I'm sure.
You really sure?
I'll call you back.
So we can be friends who sleep together.
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.
Like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me.
So just out of curiosity.
.
.
.
.
.
do you currently have any other "racquetball" buddies?
Just your dad.
Although that's actually racquetball.
You know, I do have a blind date.
.
.
.
.
.
with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday.
Do you want me to cancel it?
No!
Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.
-And we're just friends.
-Exactly.
Oh, don't sit down.
-Ready to go?
-You bet.
And first, here's a gift.
Stretchy pants?
!
The greatest things in the world!
lf I were you, I'd wear them every day.
Gee, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.
But, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I'll figure.
.
.
.
How's it going?
Good.
How's The Shining?
Danny just went into Room 21 7.
The next part's the best!
That dead lady in the bathtub-- You're gonna ruin it!
I'll talk in code.
Remember when the kid sees those two "blanks" in the hallway?
Yeah, that's very cool.
All "blank" and no "blank" makes "blank" a "blank-blank.
" No, the end!
Jack almost kills them with the "blank" .
.
.
.
.
.
but in the last second, they get away.
I can't believe you just did that.
I can't believe she cracked your code.
Okay.
Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no.
.
.
.
.
.
even though she's in love with him.
Then he ends up marrying Amy.
Mine was by accident!
The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.
Beth dies.
Beth dies?
Is that true?
lf I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die.
Does she, Rachel?
He's asking if you've ruined.
.
.
.
.
.
the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.
No.
She doesn't die.
Then why would you say that?
Because I wanted to hurt you.
Oh, there they are.
I dropped my keys.
Got them.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
You would not believe my day.
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off.
.
.
.
.
.
I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.
What are you smiling at?
I was thinking your day could still pick up.
I love this "friend" thing!
Robert's gonna be here any second, so could one of you just tell him?
Please, right now.
Every time I see him, it's "Is it on the loose?
ls it watching me"?
We can't tell him.
You can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his "stuff.
" He's right.
Even if it's to say something complimentary.
You ready for the gym?
There's a new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.
Yeah, I can spot you from here.
What?
Listen, Robert.
.
.
.
Hey, don't we have to.
.
.
?
Yeah, we got.
.
.
.
I think you're really, really great.
Oh, God.
Here we go again.
Why does this keep happening?
ls it something I'm putting out there?
Is this my fault?
Or am I just nuts?
I don't know what to say.
Hey, buddy?
This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.
Really?
It's just like everyone else's apartment.
It's got rooms and walls and ceilings.
I just wanted to see where you live.
Now give me the tour.
Oh, my God!
-This is the living room.
-That's nice.
-And this is the kitchen.
-That's real pretty.
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?
Well, it's pretty much your typical.
.
.
.
.
.
bedroom.
We're still on this side of the door.
I didn't get to see it.
Oh, shoot.
Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.
So who is she?
That was the blind date I told you about.
She called and switched it from Tuesday.
Did you like her?
I'm just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.
Well, you seem fine.
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine.
I'm not.
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.
She wants to see your bedroom.
You know what?
What if we're friends.
.
.
.
.
.
who don't see other people?
You mean "exclusive" friends?
Why not?
I mean, this has been the most amazing week.
Would it be so terrible?
Even if we were friends who lived together?
Or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends.
.
.
.
.
.
and vowed to be friends forever.
You know, we're back where we were.
Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
That's not true.
You don't have a moustache.
Okay, one thing's changed.
But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.
You know what?
I gotta walk out of here right now.
Because getting over you is the hardest thing I have ever had to do.
I don't think I could do it again.
I know I couldn't.
How about one last game of racquetball?
Watch the thorns!
What?
Beth is really, really sick.
Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she can do.
You wanna put the book in the freezer?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
'Cause every time I see your face I can 't help but fall from grace This girl's good.
Yeah, a song with rhyming words!
I never thought of that before.
I like her.
Why?
Because she can both sing and play guitar at the same time?
That's all I'm looking for from these people.
Look at you, all jealous.
Come on, Pheebs.
You two have completely different styles.
She's more.
.
.
.
You know?
And you're more.
.
.
.
Say you'll stay beside me See?
Everybody else is happy she's done.
Okay, my next song's called: "Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say?
I Loved When We Were.
.
.
.
.
.
Singing Partners and I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way.
" One of those "Iook for the hidden meaning" songs.
The One With Phoebe's Ex-Partner .
:staz:.
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, Leslie.
How'd you know I'd be here?
I saw vlad at the place where they sell the big fish.
He said you played here a lot, so.
.
.
.
I have to go to the bathroom.
If "big-fish place" comes up again.
.
.
.
.
.
I'd like to know if that's several big fish or just one big fish.
So Phoebe says you write jingles.
Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Anything we might've heard of?
Home is never far away Home is Homestar Stew.
But I don't do that anymore.
I got kind of sick of it.
And then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Bummer.
Well, you know, I was just.
.
.
.
I was just thinking and just hoping that.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe you'd want to get back together?
No, but, thanks.
Come on, Phoebe.
Would you just think about it?
No, but, thanks.
See you, Pheebs.
That was kind of brutal.
Let this be a lesson to all of you.
Once you betray me, I become like the lce Woman.
I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.
You know, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.
Can I have a tissue?
Is someone in there?
I'm playing a daredevil game.
.
.
.
.
.
called "Wait Until the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die.
" Jeez, man!
Did you fall--?
Hi!
So did you?
Did you fall high?
Someone was in the ladies' room.
I couldn't wait.
I left the lid up for you, though.
You know what, Gunther?
Go ahead.
I'm talking to.
.
.
.
This is where you say your name.
Ginger.
Ginger.
I'm talking to Ginger, so.
.
.
Don't you have to use the bathroom?
No, I just-- I'd rather talk to you.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I do have to go to the bathroom.
There's someone in here.
-Where's Chandler?
-He can't make it.
He said he had to go back to his job and-- Joey?
Joey Tribbiani?
I can see you, okay?
You're hiding behind the coats.
Close one.
Hi.
Hi, sweetie.
Hello.
Hey, Ross.
-I've got some bad news.
-What?
I can eat, but I have to come back here.
Come on.
You've worked late every night for two weeks.
-What is it now?
-It's my fault.
I quit today.
But work comes first!
But that's sad about you, though.
What happened?
What happened?
Burn out?
Burn all out, did you?
He's leaving for a better job.
That's great.
So I guess this is goodbye then.
Goodbye.
Okay, then.
Well, we're gonna miss you around here.
Yeah, me too.
-So see you on Saturday.
-Yeah, you bet!
Now, you know those are a delicacy in lndia.
That was Leslie calling to see if we can get back together.
It's like the 20th time today.
Yeah, good luck, Leslie.
She must've hurt you bad.
Well, yeah.
You know, we were best friends.
.
.
.
.
.
ever since we were little.
Our moms worked on the barge together.
You two must've been so cute, running around on a barge.
You never run on a barge!
Is Chandler around?
He met some girl at the coffeehouse.
Ginger something.
Sure it wasn't something that sounded liked Ginger?
Like "Gingeer"?
No, it was Ginger.
I remember because when he told me, I said: The movie star Oh, man!
That's the girl I was hiding from.
When she sees he's my roommate, she'll tell him what I did.
What did you do?
Oh, no!
I can't.
.
.
.
I can't tell you.
It's the most awful thing I've ever done.
Don't tell us.
We'll wait till Chandler gets home.
It'll be more fun that way.
It was, like, four years ago.
Ginger and I had gone out a few times.
Then one weekend.
.
.
.
.
.
we went to her Dad's cabin.
.
.
.
.
.
just me, her and her annoying little dog, Pepper.
That night I cooked this really romantic dinner-- You gave her food poisoning!
I wish.
After dinner, me, her and Pepper fell asleep in front of the fire.
I woke up in the middle of the night and saw the fire was dying out.
.
.
.
.
.
so I picked up a log and threw it on.
Or what I thought was a log.
Oh, my God!
You threw Pepper on the fire!
I wish.
Another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger.
.
.
.
.
.
is that she kind of has a. .
.
.
.
.
artificial leg.
Oh, my God!
What did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
I ran!
That's the best kiss I've had.
.
.
.
.
.
with anybody I met in a men's room.
Actually, me too.
Foot all in the puddle!
Damn!
I hate that!
-You'll have to get out of those shoes.
-Don't worry.
No, really.
You're gonna freeze.
No, I'm not.
You're not?
Have you got a bionic foot?
Someday.
Maybe.
Funny book?
I'm just thinking about something funny I heard today.
Mark saying, "I'll see you Saturday.
" Yeah, at the lecture.
I told you last week.
You said you didn't mind.
It's not the lecture I mind.
Please tell me it's not because I'm going with Mark.
-Well-- -Oh, my God!
I'm sorry, but if you're not working with him anymore.
.
.
.
.
.
why do you still hang out?
Because he's my friend.
But do you really need another "friend"?
If I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?
Is that funny?
Am I suppose to be laughing?
I don't know.
You thought "See you Saturday" was funny.
Mark is in fashion.
I like having a friend I can share this stuff with.
You guys would never go to a lecture with me.
I'd love to go with you.
Really?
I have clothes.
I even pick them out.
For all you know, I could be a fashion.
.
.
: : :monger: I would love for you to go with me.
What?
What should I wear?
Now I'm all nervous.
You know, they say "A watched pot never beeps.
" It's been a couple hours.
.
.
.
.
.
and she hasn't called.
Not that I even care.
I don't.
Why don't you just call her?
You obviously want to.
You think you know me so well.
Well, don't you wanna?
So I do know you.
That's what I said.
Well, so?
I can't.
I can't.
She dumped me.
I totally trusted her, then one day it was like: "Okay, bye, Pheebs.
" Gone!
You know what the saddest part is?
When we were playing together, that was.
.
.
.
.
.
the most fun I've ever had in all my lives.
My favorite shoes, so good to me I wear them every day Down at the heel, holes in the toes Don 't care what people say My feet's best friend Pals to the end With them, I'm one hot chickie Though late one night Not much light I stepped in something icky Sticky shoes, sticky shoes Always make me smile Sticky shoes, sticky shoes Next time I'll avoid the pile!
We're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.
For instance, a sheer navy blouse over a pink.
.
.
.
I'm really glad we came.
You're so pretty.
I love you.
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat It's not your fault That's great!
You know, you could totally sell this.
It'd be perfect for, like, a kitty-litter campaign.
A jingle?
Why not?
You'd make a ton of money.
If I was in this for the money, I'd be a millionaire by now.
You gotta get out of that jingle-head.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
I'm gonna play a song now that's really, really sad.
It's called "Magician Box Mix-Up.
" Oversized bracelets, oversized earrings.
.
.
.
.
.
oversizing of accessories, in general, is very popular now.
Can I borrow this?
My milk's gone bad.
I hate that.
I once had a thing of half-and-half.
Stole my car.
So how was your date with Ginger?
Great.
It was great.
She's.
.
.
.
She's great.
Great looks and personality.
Greatness.
Sounds like she's got the.
.
.
.
.
.
whole package.
Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Oh, God!
It freaked me out.
It shouldn't, but it did.
I wanna keep seeing her, but it's like: "Hey, you know what?
Where's your leg"?
I'm the smallest person in the world, aren't l?
Morning.
Actually, he's the smallest person in the world.
Heard about the leg-burning, huh?
It came up.
Listen, I know it's a long shot, but.
.
.
.
.
.
by any chance, did she find that funny?
So I nodded off a little!
"Nodded off"?
Ross, you were snoring!
My father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on!
Forty-five minutes.
.
.
.
Forty-five minutes, the man talked about strappy-backed dresses.
Okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium.
.
.
.
.
.
Iistening to Professor "Pitstains" say: "Remember that thing that died a gazillion years ago?
Well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had!
" First of all, it's Professor Pitain.
And second of all, that little bone proved that.
.
.
.
.
.
that particular dinosaur had wings but didn't fly.
Okay, you know what I just heard?
A hundred million people went to see a movie about what I do.
I wonder how many people would go see a movie called Jurassic Parka.
Oh, that is so-- A bunch of out-of-control jackets take over an island!
If what I do is so lame.
.
.
.
.
.
then why did you insist on coming with me this morning?
Was it so I just wouldn't go with Mark?
I wanted to be with you.
I don't know, I feel like lately.
.
.
.
.
.
you're slipping away from me.
.
.
.
.
.
with this new job and all these new people.
And you've got this whole other life going on.
I know it's dumb.
.
.
.
.
.
but I just hate that I'm not a part of it.
It's not dumb.
But maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.
You know what I mean?
I mean, it's like.
.
.
.
.
.
I like that you're not involved in that part of my life.
That's a little clearer.
See, it doesn't mean I don't love you.
.
.
.
.
.
because I do.
I love you so much.
But my work-- It's for me, you know?
I'm out there on my own, and I'm doing it.
And it's scary, but I love it because it's mine.
But I mean, is that okay?
Sure.
You're thinking about my leg.
Actually, I forgot.
What's the deal with that again?
Look, it's okay if it bothers you.
I only need to know how much it bothers you.
.
.
.
.
.
because I don't like wasting my time.
Am I wasting my time?
No, I don't think so.
It's like anything else.
You just have to get used to it.
What's that?
That's my "nubbin.
" What's a nubbin?
It's kind of a third-nipple kind of thing.
You have three nipples?
Well, you know, two regulars.
.
.
.
.
.
and one that barely qualifies as a-- What?
Nothing.
You know, l. .
.
.
I just remembered.
I have to leave.
You have to leave?
Now?
How come?
Well, it's nubbin.
Nothing!
You know what?
I'll see you later.
I thought you weren't coming.
-Where were you?
-Come here, come here.
Don't get mad, okay?
Don't give me a reason to get mad, okay?
I played Smelly Cat for my old ad agency.
They went nuts!
I told you I didn't want you to try and sell it.
.
.
.
.
.
and you just big, fat did it anyway!
I think, five years ago, I probably would have done anything.
.
.
.
.
.
to play with you.
But I can do it myself.
If I can't trust you, then forget it.
I don't wanna forget it.
You know what?
You have to choose.
If the most important thing on the planet to you.
.
.
.
.
.
is this cat-poopy thing, then you can have Smelly Cat.
But we won't be partners.
So what's it gonna be?
-Smelly cat, smelly cat -Problem odor in the litter box?
Don 't change your kitty, change your kitty litter.
It's not your fault Sorry, Pheebs.
You okay?
I actually am.
Because, you know, life's gonna hand you all kinds of stuff.
You learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow.
-You wanna hear a new song?
-We'd love to.
Jingle bitch screwed me over Go to hell, jingle whore Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell That's all I have so far.
Well, hello!
-Where you been?
-The doctor.
Is everything okay?
Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.
Two nipples, no waiting.
Well!
Just like Rachel in high school.
What?
Come on, I was kidding!
It was such an obvious joke.
That was an obvious joke.
And I didn't think of it.
Why?
The source of all my powers.
Oh, dear God, what have I done?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
How much you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?
I won't give you anything, but you'll owe me $2.95.
Done.
I need an atlas!
I need an atlas!
Why?
Do you have a report due?
I have a date with diplomat I met.
.
.
.
.
.
while I was giving free massages outside the U.N. And I don't know where his country is.
Let's start with the free massages at the U.N. It's my new thing.
I figure, "Bodies at peace make peace.
" You might just get the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.
So what country is this guy from?
There's a "g" in there.
Where's that?
In your atlas!
I don't have an atlas.
But wait, I do have a globe.
Hold on.
So what's this guy like?
Well, he's very.
.
.
.
.
.
dashing, you know?
And very, very sophisticated.
And he doesn't speak English.
.
.
.
.
.
but his translator says he totally gets me.
Okay, here you go.
What is this?
It's a globe.
And a pencil sharpener.
Need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.
No, thanks.
Just give me anything I can make two of.
If you have nothing to copy, why go there?
Are you just gonna gawk at that girl.
.
.
.
.
.
with the bellybutton ring again?
You wanna come?
The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break .
:staz:.
Come on, Chloe.
Finish with your customer first.
Come on, Chloe.
Come on, Chloe!
Can I help you?
We're having second thoughts about our copying needs.
And we'll need more time to think about it.
Chloe, switch with me.
Some guys have a crush on you.
Okay, that hurt us.
Hi, guys.
I haven't seen you since this morning.
Well.
.
.
.
.
.
you know.
What are you doing tomorrow?
Both of us?
Maybe.
Does that scare you?
Relax.
Isaac's deejaying at The Philly.
-You should come.
-We'll be there.
Great.
I'll see you then.
All right!
Rock on.
He says that walking with you makes this strange city feel like home.
Me too.
Although this city is my home.
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.
You make something up.
Nice!
Thank you.
This is me, here.
Your eyes are very pretty.
Thank you very much.
Oh, thank you.
He would like to kiss you.
You don't have to do that now.
No, no, not him!
No, you don't.
The moment's over.
There it is, right there.
It's small.
Yeah, but Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks.
.
.
.
.
.
to get all the way across it.
So you had fun?
Except for, you know, when you're on a date.
.
.
.
.
.
and you're getting along great.
.
.
.
.
.
but the guy's translator keeps getting in the way?
Is Rach in her room?
She's still at work, but she said to call her.
Is she gonna cancel on me again?
How could she do this?
What about our anniversary?
This is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.
"Call Rachel.
" What's that on the bottom?
That's my doodle of a ladybug with a top hat.
She's fancy.
-Hey, honey.
-Oh, hi.
What's going on?
Shipping had a disaster.
I've gotta get this order in.
I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'll be here all night.
What?
Well, how about I come up there?
No, honey, please.
I just have too much to deal with.
Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and.
.
.
.
Could you be the translator's date.
.
.
.
.
.
so that when we want to be alone.
.
.
.
.
.
you two can split off?
You know, he's kind of cute.
Like, "really kind of cute"?
Or "kind of cute" Iike your friend Spackle-Back Larry?
Don't call him that.
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.
Maybe we should get going.
What time did Chloe say to get there?
-1 0:30.
-What time is it now?
So we'll hang out.
Remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes, vividly.
-She was kidding about that, right?
-Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, I think so.
God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight.
Yeah, I mean.
.
.
.
.
.
what would we do?
Dude, I don't know.
She was kidding.
She was.
.
.
.
Just in case, we should have some ground rules.
Yeah.
For sure.
You probably want the first one to be, "Never open your eyes.
" Because you don't want to be doing something.
.
.
.
.
.
and then look up, right?
And see something that you don't want to be seeing.
Good call.
Nice.
Hold it!
Hold it!
What if my eyes are closed, and.
.
.
.
.
.
and my hand is out there.
.
.
.
Okay, eyes open at all times!
How do we decide where we.
.
.
.
.
.
you know, each would.
.
.
.
.
.
you know.
.
.
.
.
.
be?
Right.
Well, you know, we could flip for it.
I guess.
But like, what's heads and what's tails?
If you don't know that, I don't want to do this with you.
No, no.
I am looking at a purchase order here.
.
.
.
.
.
that shows we ordered the Riviera bikini.
.
.
.
.
.
in a variety of sizes and colors-- What does it matter what I'm wearing?
Could I speak to your supervisor?
Thank you.
Hi.
My God!
What are you doing here?
Well, you said you couldn't go out, so.
.
.
.
You brought a picnic!
What a boyfriend.
That's it.
On Monday, I start wearing makeup.
Honey, this is very nice, but I've got a crisis.
But I've got couscous!
Honey, I know it's our anniversary.
.
.
.
.
.
but I told you on the phone, I don't have time to stop.
You don't have to stop.
I'm invisible.
I'm not here.
Yeah, but I don't-- Who approved that order?
Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.
-Get Mark on the phone!
-I love Mark.
Do you know him?
Let me check that with what I've got.
See, 038 is not the number for this store.
038 is Atlanta.
Pepper?
None for me.
Okay, sorry!
Sorry.
As I was saying, the store number is wrong.
And I'm sorry, but-- Oh, my God!
I have to call you back.
I've got Shemp in my office.
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry.
But somebody's off the phone!
How about a glass of wine.
.
.
.
.
.
by the fire?
I can get it going again.
.
.
.
You're not listening.
I don't have time to stop.
-You don't have 1 0 minutes?
-I don't have 1 0 minutes!
-Sophie, does she have 1 0 minutes?
-I told you, I don't!
Don't yell.
This is the most I've seen you all week.
Look, I cannot do this right now.
I've got a deadline!
Go home and we'll talk later.
-Yeah, but wait--!
-Goodbye!
Actually, that's our three-hole punch.
Hi.
Look, about what happened earlier-- I completely understand.
You were stressed.
I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.
For letting you throw me out of your office?
You had no right coming down to my office.
You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work.
.
.
.
.
.
unless they're a park ranger!
Excuse me for wanting to be with my girl on our anniversary.
Boy, what an ass am l!
But I told you I didn't have the time!
Well, you never have the time.
I don't feel like I have a girlfriend anymore.
Do you want me to quit my job.
.
.
.
.
.
so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
It would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.
Just a job?
It's the first time in my life I'm doing something I care about!
The first time I'm doing something I'm good at!
If you don't get that-- I get that, and I'm happy for you.
But I'm tired of dating your answering machine!
I don't know what to do!
Well, neither do l!
Is this about Mark?
Oh, my God!
Okay, it's not.
Oh, my God!
I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again.
You're making this too hard.
I'm making this too hard?
What should I do?
I don't know!
I don't know!
Look.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe we should just take a break!
Fine, you're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's cool off.
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
A break from us.
--advances in collating in the past five years.
We just got in an X-5000, you know?
The X-5000 makes an X-50 look like a T-71 .
It's the dinosaur guy!
-Hi, Ross!
-Hi, Chloe.
I want you to meet some friends of mine.
He's my hero.
He'll want to blow stuff up 400 percent.
We say we don't do that.
He says, "You gotta.
" Know what?
We did it.
Now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say, "Let's Ross it!
" And that's the only color that comes in.
Yo, Chloe!
Do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
What are you doing?
I thought tonight's your anniversary dinner.
A little change of plans.
We're gonna break up instead.
And I can speak a little French.
Why?
What did I say?
Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh, my God!
No wonder I get such great service at CafÃ© Maurice.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hi.
Could you please tell Sergei that I was fascinated.
.
.
.
.
.
by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in the Times?
You didn't say "Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
" Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
He says he was too.
Interesting.
So I was wondering-- Before you get all talky again.
.
.
.
.
.
could you also please tell Sergei.
.
.
.
.
.
that I really like his suit.
He said, "Thank you.
You look pretty tonight.
Your hair, golden like the sun.
" So you're a chef?
I'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.
Really?
Could I talk to you behind my menu?
What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.
Misha's so interested in you, Sergei and I haven't been able to talk at all.
You want me to sit silently, while you three converse?
That would be great.
Thank you.
Hi.
It's Mark.
What?
ls it my breath?
Sorry.
I just thought you were somebody else.
I was just gonna leave a message.
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?
Rach?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
You wanna talk?
I can come over.
Really, no.
Please.
That's okay.
All right.
I'm coming over with Chinese food.
I'm not hungry.
It's for me.
Bye.
-So what'll you do?
-What can I do?
One person wants to break up, you break up.
No way.
This is you guys.
Call her and work it out.
We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait awhile?
It isn't like swimming after you eat.
Pick up the phone!
You know that swimming thing is a myth.
Tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
Why?
What happened to him?
Nothing.
He just really believes in that.
Then we got into this big fight-- It was awful.
I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something.
.
.
.
And then.
.
.
.
.
.
I told him I wanted to take a break.
I don't want to take a break.
I'm sorry.
Egg roll?
And then I called him and he wasn't there.
He's probably just out.
Thank you, that's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.
Hi, it's me.
Oh, I'm so glad you called.
Really?
This is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?
What do you want to drink?
Who's that?
Nobody?
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Is that Mark?
Honey, he just came over-- Yeah, got it!
Hey, Dinosaur Guy!
Look at you, so sad.
Come dance.
That's okay.
Thanks.
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.
I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?
Two beers!
And the vet said it was time.
And so from half a world away.
.
.
.
.
.
while my mother held the phone to his ear.
.
.
.
.
.
I said goodbye to my dog.
.
.
.
.
.
in seven languages.
-Could I have a tissue?
-Oh, sure.
I just hope you don't accidentally.
.
.
.
.
.
suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Sergei would like to apologize for my behavior tonight.
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted.
" Unbelievable.
For the first time in years, someone wants to talk to me.
But do you think he would let me enjoy that?
No!
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English?
Excuse me, but isn't he paying for your dinner?
The man's dog just died.
I have just resigned my post.
Will you accompany me to the Rainbow Room?
I have diplomatic coupons.
It would be my pleasure.
My guy has coupons.
Your guy can't even say "coupons.
" Plate.
Plate!
Yes!
Plate!
See, we don't need them.
I like this song.
Well, you're practically dancing, already.
Why don't you just do it over here?
What are you, married?
Because that's okay.
Oh, be home, be home, be home.
.
.
.
You're not home.
Still no smile?
--Miss American Pie Ameri-can.
It's a very hard language.
Let's do it again.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
-Previously on Friends.
.
.
.
-I don't feel like I have a girlfriend.
You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
-Is this about Mark?
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, it's not.
-Oh, my God.
I cannot keep having this fight with you!
Maybe we should just take a break.
Fine.
You're right.
Let's take a break.
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
A break from us.
Then we had this big fight, and I said I wanted to take a break.
I don't want to take a break.
This is crazy.
Can 't we work on this?
What do you want to drink?
Who's that?
Nobody.
Is that Mark?
Honey, look, he just-- Yeah.
Got it!
Hey, come dance.
What, are you married?
Because that's okay.
THE NEXT MORNING How was the big anniversary dinner?
Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Nice.
We kind of broke up instead.
What?
My God!
It's on the ceiling!
That's okay.
This is more important than fruit.
.
.
.
.
.
on my ceiling.
You broke up?
Yeah, but it's okay because when Ross left, Mark came over.
-Oh, no!
You and Mark?
-It's okay.
Calm down.
Mark and I talked.
.
.
.
.
.
and I realized how much I love your stupid brother.
We got our problems, but I really wanna make it work.
Morning!
The One the Morning After .
:staz:.
It's me.
I've been trying to reach you all night.
I feel awful.
There's nothing between me and Mark.
This whole breakup thing is just stupid.
I'm sorry I put you through it.
And I don 't want to get back together over a machine.
So I love you.
I love you.
And you know what?
I'm gonna go to bed now but on my way to work tomorrow, I'll stop by around 8:30.
Bye.
Chloe, how's it coming?
What kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Well, how about a big one?
-But my apartment's so-- -Then a small one.
-We have to go.
-Wait!
Where's my shoes?
You need shoes?
-Do I know why we're rushing?
-You know my girlfriend?
It turns out that she wants to get back together.
I found it!
That's so great for you guys!
You must be so happy!
Yes, I am.
One of the many things I'm feeling.
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.
-You got my message?
-You are right on time!
So can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can.
very much.
-Why are you mopping your ceiling?
-There's banana on it.
I have the spirit of an old lndian woman living in mine.
So, then, you know.
The mailman was here, so I brought your mail.
-Oh, good.
Thanks.
-Now, what is Fabutech?
Don't judge me too much, okay?
I saw this infomercial, and I swear I have never.
.
.
.
.
.
bought anything on Tv before.
Except for this mop.
But there was this amazing stuff on leg-waxing-- Waxine!
Yes!
Have you seen it?
It's incredible!
I want to be a Waxine Girl!
I know!
Do you think it really doesn't hurt?
How can they do that?
Hello!
Organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest?
They have the best stuff in there.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone to make up with Rachel.
Which is probably what you should have done.
You think?
God, I'm in hell.
I mean, what am I gonna do?
Rachel's all "I love you," and all I can think about.
.
.
.
.
.
is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did?
First, we should address the more important question.
.
.
.
.
.
how dumb are you?
Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?
How can I do that without being honest?
I'm onboard about the total-honesty thing.
I am.
Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
He's right.
Nobody benefits, and you'll just hurt her.
And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
Don't you think-- If you have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.
And that's what deathbeds are for.
-Yeah, okay.
-All right.
Okay.
Now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.
Did you think about the trail?
What trail?
From the woman you did it with.
.
.
.
.
.
to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!
Always think about the trail!
I don't think there's any trail.
Chloe works with that guy, lsaac.
Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works at the massage place with Phoebe.
Phoebe is Rachel's friend, and that's the trail!
I did it!
"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg--" Did that!
"Grasp the linen strip by its tab.
.
.
.
.
.
and pull it off in one quick, pain-free motion.
" Was it not "pain-free"?
No, it was pain-ful!
My God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
" The girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
Because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.
But you know, if you don't believe me, please, be my guest.
Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
Chloe, hi.
Is this about me taking your watch?
-You took my watch?
-I'm sorry.
I do that.
You keep it.
Listen, did you tell anyone about us?
I feel like it really isn't anybody's business.
Exactly.
So you didn't mention anything to lsaac?
-I tell lsaac everything.
-You do?
Of course you do.
Hi, lsaac.
You know, we haven't actually met.
You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog.
But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.
Right.
Rachel from the coffee place.
That's the one.
Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
I know.
It doesn't matter how much we love them.
Monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
No problem.
We gotta look out for each other.
We're the same, you and me.
Actually, no, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
No, we're not.
Yeah, we are.
No, we're not.
-Okay, we're not.
-Right.
But we are.
Fine.
I just need to know that you won't tell your sister.
I can promise not to tell her again.
Jasmine?
We met at Phoebe's birthday party.
I'm Ross Geller.
You did a bad thing!
-Yes, I did.
-very bad!
-very bad.
-very, very bad!
I'm agreeing with you.
Listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
Please.
Please don't.
I love my girlfriend very much and I want to work it out with her.
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
But you should talk to my roommate.
I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.
Who's your roommate?
Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.
I'm sorry.
Was I not supposed to?
-We're all right.
-It's okay.
It's okay.
-We were just waxing our legs.
-Off?
For your information, this is a pain like no man will ever experience.
Unless you've been kicked in an area.
.
.
.
.
.
that God only meant to be treated nicely.
Women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.
I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
Oh, yeah?
Come here.
Oh, that's mature.
So now I just pull it off?
That's right.
Just talk to me.
Please!
Talk to you?
I can't even look at you right now.
Nothing.
Nothing.
-She said it was okay.
-What are they talking about?
-Just get away from me!
-I made a mistake, okay?
A mistake?
What were you trying to put it in?
Her purse?
Where did he put it?
You had sex with another woman!
Oh, my God!
I knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.
I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk-- You guys knew about this and didn't tell us?
He has sex and we get hit in our heads!
I want you to leave!
Just get out!
Now!
I want to stay and talk about this.
All right.
How was she?
-What?
-Was she good?
Don't answer that.
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Let's talk.
How was she?
-She was.
.
.
.
-Awful.
-She was not good.
-Horrible.
Nothing compared to you.
She was different.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
-Just stop!
-What?
Okay!
Okay!
Okay!
Should we do something?
Yeah.
Never cheat on Rachel.
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry.
I was disgusted with myself.
.
.
.
.
.
and this morning I was upset.
.
.
.
.
.
and then I got your message and I was so happy.
And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment-- Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Wait a minute.
What time did your little friend leave?
Oh, my God.
She was there?
She was still there?
She was in there when I was in there?
Listen, the important thing is she meant nothing to me.
And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!
I didn't think there was a relationship.
-We'd broken up.
-We were on a break.
That, for all I knew, could last forever.
That is a breakup.
You gonna get out of this on a technicality?
I'm not trying to "get out" of anything.
I thought our relationship was dead.
Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.
I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
What are you doing?
We can't go out.
Why not?
I'm hungry.
Because they'll know we've been listening.
God!
And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
Oh, that is so sweet.
I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
We can go out.
They have other things to worry about.
We'll be fine.
Rachel, I wanted to tell you.
I thought I should.
And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!
Wax the door shut.
We're never leaving.
It's Phoebe.
Someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak.
.
.
.
.
.
because it's 9: 1 5 now, and I'm not there.
None of this would've happened if I didn't think.
.
.
.
.
.
you were having sex with Mark?
All right.
Let's say I had slept with Mark.
Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes, I would.
You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me.
.
.
.
.
.
and made love to me?
If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were-- I would have been devastated.
.
.
.
.
.
but I would still want to be with you.
Because, I mean, it's you.
Come on, tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna order a pizza.
Order a pizza, like.
.
.
.
.
.
"I forgive you"?
Oh, man!
Pizza?
I like pizza.
Put olives on the pizza.
We could eat the wax!
It's organic!
Oh, great.
Food with hair on it.
No, not the used wax.
Because that would be crazy?
Could I get in on that?
Because I'm kind of hungry myself.
Fine.
Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
-No anchovies.
-With extra anchovies.
That's okay.
I'll pick them off.
And could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce?
You can have the last piece if you want.
Well, I should think so.
You slept with someone.
They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
Yeah.
Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.
They've got to.
What if they don't?
You think I need a new walk?
What?
Well, I've been walking the same way since high school.
You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?
I think I need a take-notice walk.
Are you actually saying these words?
What, now you're not even talking to me?
Look, Rachel, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I was out of my mind.
I thought I'd lost you.
How insane must I have been to do something like this?
I don't cheat, right?
That's not me.
I'm not Joey!
It's 3 a.m. They don't know that I've come home yet.
You notice how they aren't wondering where I am?
You know, people can be so self-involved.
You know what?
I'm not the one that wanted that break.
You're the one that bailed.
You're the one.
.
.
.
.
.
that ran the moment things got rough.
-That's-- -That's what?
-That is neither here nor there.
-Here we are.
.
.
.
.
.
in a spot again.
What do you want?
How do you want to handle it?
You want to fight for us or bail?
Look, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay?
I'm sorry.
I wish I could take it back, but I can't.
I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
I love you so much.
No, Ross!
Don't!
You can't just kiss me and make it all go away.
It doesn't work that way.
It doesn't just make it better.
I think you should go.
What?
I really think you need to go now.
This morning you said there was nothing we couldn't work out.
What the hell did I know?
There's got to be a way we can work past this.
I can't imagine my life without you.
Without these arms.
.
.
.
.
.
and your face and heart.
.
.
.
.
.
your good heart, Rach, and.
.
.
.
I can't.
You're a totally different person to me now.
I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.
Ever.
Now I can't stop picturing you with her.
I can't.
It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.
It's just changed everything.
Forever.
This can't be it.
Then how come it is?
They've been quiet for a long time.
Maybe she killed him.
Let's go.
Is that your new walk?
I really have to pee.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Can I see the comics?
This is the New York Times.
Okay, may I see the comics?
I thought you were taking Ross to the game.
-We are.
He's meeting us here.
-No, Rachel's meeting us here!
Come on!
They can be in the same room.
-You should've been there last night.
-What happened?
Ross was hanging out at our place.
Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturizer from Chandler-- How hard is it to say "something"?
Rachel came over to borrow "something.
" Anyway, her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.
He says they were on a break when it happened.
.
.
.
.
.
so she should've forgiven him by now.
He is so unreasonable!
God!
Although I understand what he means.
Oh, my God!
This is like 60 Minutes .
.
.
when at first you're mad that pharmaceutical company made the drug.
And then, you just feel bad for the people, because.
.
.
.
.
.
they needed to make their hair grow.
You know, this is like when my parents got divorced.
I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were still together.
And we were all hanging out and happy.
I had the same dream.
-And nobody slept with the xerox girl.
-Oh, I had the opposite dream.
Maybe it's gonna be okay.
I mean, it's been a week.
It never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship.
It never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
Let's go!
Let's hit the road.
Let's get the show on it.
Let me get coffee.
I know the best coffeehouse.
And it's close.
Closer than here?
Oh, look!
I found coffee!
Okay, let's skedaddle.
I'm not gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
Okay, Your Highness.
"Rachel, I'm really sorry.
" "Okay, Ross.
Wanna get back together"?
"Yeah, okay.
" Did anyone else hear that?
The One Without the Ski Trip .
:staz:.
Is he here?
Here's your moisturizer.
You guys are gonna love me!
Okay, check it out.
Thursday night, five tickets.
Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.
I said that out loud, right?
Yes, it's just that we kind of already.
.
.
.
.
.
made plans with Ross.
Well, okay.
Well, there you go.
It's just, he got this new home-theater dealy.
.
.
.
.
.
and he wants us to check it out.
He's excited about it too.
He even recorded showtimes on his answering machine.
-We're sorry, honey.
-Oh, it's okay.
Rach, it's not that we don't want to.
Really.
Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.
Ross did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Come on.
If he asked you first, it's only fair.
Oh, boy, do I feel bad!
very bad.
Chandler, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!
You're smoking again?
Well, actually, yesterday, I was smoking again.
Today I'm smoking, still.
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
This is just like my parents' divorce.
.
.
.
.
.
which is when I first started smoking.
Weren't you 9?
I'm telling you something, that first smoke after naptime.
.
.
.
That's great.
With my luck, that's him.
Him?
Ross?
No, "Hymn" 253: "His Eyes Are on the Sparrow.
" When my parents got divorced, I started using humor as a defense mechanism.
Hi.
Do you guys have weekend plans?
Because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin, skiing.
I'm asking you first, right?
I'm playing by the rules.
Absolutely.
Chandler!
You're smoking?
What are you doing?
Shut up!
You're not my real mom!
Could you close that window?
My nipples could cut glass!
Really?
Because mine get me out of tickets.
Look, I just wanna say I really appreciate you spending time with me.
It's been a hard time right now, so I just want to say thanks.
Somebody else hug him.
I have to stay by the window.
How about this weekend, we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?
And maybe a tournament on my new: : : .
.
.
dart board!
What do you think?
Two days of darts!
It'll be great!
It'll be great for next weekend.
This weekend, guys.
It'll be great for next weekend.
I mean, "It'll be great.
" What's going on?
We're sort of invited to go skiing.
You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?
So, for the whole weekend?
We're really sorry, but she did ask us first.
That's okay.
If you all have to go away.
.
.
.
.
.
for the first weekend I'm alone by myself.
.
.
.
.
.
then I totally understand.
I can stay.
I'm gonna stay.
The last time I went, I was afraid to leave the chair lift.
I just went round and round.
We need you to drive us there in your grandmother's cab.
-But you know what?
I'll stay.
-No, I'll stay.
He's my brother.
What, a "pity stay"?
We're gonna have fun!
We can make fudge.
Pity food?
You know what?
I don't need any of you to stay.
Nobody stays.
Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.
Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
You think he's still mad?
He's probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles.
What?
Mine aren't tinted.
What?
What does the sign say?
"Beam me up, Jesus.
" The "No Smoking" sign.
There's no smoking in my grandmother's cab.
Well, then, I have to go to the bathroom.
Oh, please!
No unscheduled stops.
You can go when we stop for gas.
There's a rest stop right up there.
Come on, I really have to go!
Oh, now I have to go!
Here we go.
-Brace yourself!
-What?
-Aren't you gonna go?
-No, thanks.
Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
They never have any paper in there.
So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy.
" Well, if everybody's going.
.
.
.
Don't close it!
The keys are in there!
-What's going on?
-My lighter's in there!
Damn!
The tailpipe's not hot enough to light this.
I can open this.
Anybody got a coat hanger?
Oh, I do.
No, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
So if your parents hadn't divorced.
.
.
.
.
.
you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it.
One of you give me your bra underwire.
Come on!
Who has the biggest boobs?
Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.
-No!
-It's too expensive!
To get back in the car, we need that wire.
Your call.
Monica's are the biggest.
These tiny little non-breasts?
Please!
It's gotta be Rachel.
No, mine are deceptively small.
I mean, I actually sometimes stuff my bra.
Well, then, your bra would still be big.
No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?
Phoebe, Rachel, take off Monica's bra.
All right, forget it, never mind.
-You can have mine.
-Thank you.
What are you doing?
There's a trash can right there.
I thought if I littered, that crying lndian might come by and save us.
There.
Thank you, Phoebe.
That's very, very generous.
Now, let's decide who has the nicest ass.
And there you go!
Well, at least let me smoke it to the good part!
-What's going on?
-What?
Yeah, this has happened before.
-So you know how to fix it?
-Yep.
Put more gas in.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
I was wondering, when you and I split up.
.
.
.
.
.
did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M.A. S.H .
.
.
and half the hostages coming home?
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.
Where's Ben?
He's sleeping.
Is this a bad time?
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.
It's kind of an anniversary.
I thought you guys got married in January.
A different kind of anniversary.
So anyway-- Candles, champagne.
.
.
.
Yeah, anniversaries are great.
.
.
.
.
.
because love lasts forever, you know?
There's nothing like it in this life.
Money in the bank.
So Rachel and I broke up.
God, Ross, I am so sorry!
You know what?
I wanna talk about this so much.
.
.
.
.
.
but when we can really get into it.
-You free for dinner tomorrow?
-I'd love that.
Me too.
I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Triple A can pick us up.
What town are we near?
Freemont.
Westmont.
Westberg?
Why are you answering?
Do you know what route we're on?
We are definitely on Route 27.
We are at a rest stop on Route 27-- There is no Route 27.
-Either 93 or 76.
-I don't know.
I always slept in the back when we drove here.
Can you just send someone up and down And also 93?
No, they don't do that.
Somebody will come and save us.
Who?
Have you seen a car in the last hour and a half?
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.
I am not getting in a car with Ross!
We will just have to.
.
.
.
.
.
Iive here!
-But it's so cold.
-No!
I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.
Joey and Chandler are back!
So the "going for help" went well?
Smokey Joe here got halfway to the highway and collapsed.
I have the lung capacity of a 2-year-old.
Then why are you smoking?
It's very unsettling.
Right?
I mean, it's pretty unbelievable.
They just took off, without even looking back.
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.
You and Susan.
Susan will be so pleased.
Seven-one-seven?
Where's 71 7?
You have more of these for Susan, right?
No, but that's okay.
I'll just put out pickles or something.
-Ross, thank God!
-Pheebs?
Why are you whispering?
I ate a bug.
Hey, Rach!
The tampons here are only a penny.
Let's stock up.
We're out of gas and don't know where we are so we can't get a tow truck.
Now you want a favor?
Yes, please.
I'm sorry your car broke down, Pheebs.
.
.
.
.
.
but I'm too busy with some of my real friends right now.
But please call to let me know you got home safely.
Phoebe, hang on a second.
Take my car.
Get your friends.
No, I won't pick them up.
We both know you'll do it, because you're not a jerk.
So you can sulk here for half an hour, then go get them.
.
.
-.
.
.
or save time and sulk in the car.
-Rachel doesn't-- I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark.
.
.
.
.
.
and you're the innocent victim in this.
But don't punish your friends for what Rachel did.
Yeah, you're right.
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.
What?
You slept with someone else?
We were on a break!
We were-- Where are you?
I'll find you.
You slept with another woman?
Oh, you're one to talk.
Okay, done!
What's "pleh"?
That's "help" spelled backwards.
.
.
.
.
.
so that the helicopters can read it from the air.
What's "dufus" spelled backwards?
Car!
Car!
Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives!
What is he doing here?
He is saving your butt.
Unless I'm stepping on some toes here.
.
.
.
.
.
in which case I could just mosey on.
I have plenty of people to help on the interstate.
-Come on!
-We need your help, please!
Fine!
Fine!
Oh, no!
Now it's not gonna make any sense.
You guys.
.
.
.
.
.
what do we do about Ross?
He drove all the way up here.
Just send him back, then we'll go skiing?
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.
Should we ask Ross to come along?
But what about Rachel?
How are we gonna even ask her?
Ask me what?
If it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
No, I wasn't gonna ask that.
You guys are unbelievable.
No, he cannot come!
-Excuse me?
-It's horrible!
Oh, please?
Can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
Why would you even want to come?
You're a horrible skier.
Hitting me where it hurts!
My ski skills!
Here we go again.
I can't handle this, you guys.
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.
Actually, it's the middle part of my first name.
All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
Let's go.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
Were you speaking to me, or sleeping with someone else?
We were on a break!
Why don't you just put that on your answering machine?
It's valid, and I'm not the only one who thinks so.
Monica agrees with me.
What?
I don't know.
You said it last night.
What I said was that I understood.
Joey is the one who agreed with you.
Really, Joey?
What?
You know what?
There is no right or wrong here.
I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
Obviously not to Joey.
What?
-Joey and Monica feel the way I do!
-You and this innocent puppy act!
Hey, guess who I am?
Look what you're doing to Chandler!
Look.
We know that this is really, really hard for you guys.
You don't have to love each other.
You don't even have to like each other much right now.
But please, find a way to be around each other.
And not put us in the middle.
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it for us hanging out together.
Is that what you want?
Can you be civil?
I can.
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing.
.
.
.
.
.
and my chest is unsupported.
Wait a second!
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?
Look, you guys should go.
You know, you planned this all out.
.
.
.
.
.
and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.
You drove all the way up here.
I've got to take the car back anyway.
I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben.
It's fine, okay?
Just go.
No guilt, I promise.
Thank you.
We'll call you when we get back.
Maybe we can, like, go to a movie or something.
Or the rodeo!
That would be great.
I was being Shelley Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
I know.
Bye!
Hi.
Sorry I'm late.
Were you sleeping?
Oh, great.
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.
You don't want to skimp there.
You're a genius.
It came to about $1 1 2.
But what the hell, call it an even 1 1 0?
I'll pay you tomorrow.
Bye!
So they all took off.
It was pretty hard watching them go, you know?
Yeah, okay.
Bye.
So I'm gonna take off then.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
What's so funny?
Nothing.
It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.
What?
What's so funny?
No, no.
There's none of that in here.
Come on.
At least let me finish this last one.
Only if you give me a drag.
Oh, dark mother, once again I suckle at your smoky teat.
Why don't you hold on to that one.
That's like the least fun game ever.
I'm sick of your smoking, so I brought something.
.
.
.
.
.
that is going to help you quit.
That patch is no good.
It's a hypnosis tape.
A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.
What's your problem?
Nothing.
It's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
I watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?
You always pull your pants down and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.
Forget hypnosis.
The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather.
.
.
.
.
.
and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy, young men.
Or what my father calls "Thursday night.
" The One With the Hypnosis Tape .
:staz:.
-Here you go.
-I didn't want cinnamon on this.
Sorry.
Oh, my God!
Frank!
How are you?
What are you doing here?
I would've called, but I lost your number.
And then my mom locked me out of the house, so I couldn't find it.
Then I tried to find a pay phone, and the receiver was cut off.
What happened?
vandalism.
But also, what happened between you and your mom?
We got in a fight.
She said that I was too immature to get married.
You're getting married?
My little brother's getting married!
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Do you wanna meet her?
Do l?
Do you?
Yeah, I do.
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.
I gonna go get my fiancÃ©e, man!
I'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
Isn't it fantastic?
Don't you think he's a little young to get married?
Well, he's 1 8.
It'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
Yeah, or to get a hooker.
Always illegal, Joe.
This is my fiancÃ©e.
.
.
.
.
.
Mrs. Knight.
That's my sister.
You know, it's funny.
Frank told me so much about you, but you're not how I pictured you at all.
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
Here, grab a seat.
So how did you guys meet?
I was in Mrs. Knight's.
.
.
.
I mean, Alice.
Sorry.
I always do that.
I was in her home-ec class.
He was my best student.
She was my best teacher.
If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?
We talked about just living together.
.
.
.
.
.
but we want kids right away.
Oh, my God!
Great!
Kids.
Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
How hard can it be?
You know, I mean, babies.
Who doesn't want babies?
Right?
And besides, I never had a dad around.
And now I always will, because it'll be me.
Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.
Good.
Because you were acting like you didn't.
But when it comes to love, what does age matter?
You are falling fast asleep.
Deeper, deeper, deeper.
You are now completely asleep.
You don 't need to smoke.
Cigarettes don 't control you.
You are a strong, confident woman who does not need to smoke.
A strong, confident woman.
You know what?
I realized in the last year I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.
You gotta help me out, set me up.
Get me back in the game.
Not a problem.
I work in fashion, and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Can I get you something else?
Cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.
Haven't we covered that topic?
You just said to her-- You wanna go out with me.
.
.
.
.
.
because of my wig, the big boobs, and I serve you food.
If that were true, I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.
And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.
You think she should go out with me, don't you?
You sure you wanna go out with her?
That ain't a pretty picture in the morning.
That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.
Think about it.
Oh, I will.
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.
I don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick.
It's sick and wrong!
What, is it the age thing?
I'm fine with the age thing.
.
.
.
.
.
until it sticks its tongue down my brother's throat.
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
You think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers.
.
.
.
.
.
of all the babies they have to have right away?
This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.
You know what?
It's not good home economics.
Have you told him how you feel?
Yes.
Not out loud.
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.
Come on, you guys.
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
We're walking down the street, and I turn to you and say: "Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes.
" Remember?
And then you say, "Let's just hang out at your place.
" Well, that was a nice move, dumb ass.
I think you should go out with this guy.
He doesn't do anything for me.
Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger?
Walker was looking for this big busload of kids.
All right, I get your point.
I forgot the combination to this about a year ago.
I just carry it around.
You got any Chap Stick?
How are those tapes working out?
Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.
Thank you.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny.
He seems really nice.
That check thing was adorable.
What check thing?
As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.
Pete Becker.
Pete-- Is this him?
That's Bill Clinton.
Who's he hugging?
Oh, my God.
That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?
This guy invented Moss 865.
Every office in the world uses that program.
-We use it!
-There you go!
Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
I'm not gonna go out with him.
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.
Or incredibly offensive.
Yeah, sure.
That too.
What?
All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.
Come on, think about it.
You're 1 8.
She's 44.
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
You don't think I know that?
The point is.
.
.
.
.
.
there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.
He's right.
He's right.
This is your time.
You're young.
You're weird.
Chicks dig that.
Isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.
Not anymore?
No.
I slept with someone else.
So wait.
So how did that make things better?
It didn't.
What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.
Now, what is that like?
It's so cool, man.
It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
-Why can't I find that?
-I had it and I blew it.
Well, I want it!
You can have it.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it!
I got it!
-Then, you hold on to it!
-All right, man!
All right!
Congratulations, you lucky bastard!
You're Frank's best man?
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.
What about you, huh?
I'm the ring bearer.
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real home-ec emergency.
Oh, my God.
Who died on this?
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe.
" Can you help?
Absolutely.
First, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.
-Then if that doesn't work-- -Forget it.
It's ruined.
Never say that.
If you can't get it out, cut around the stain.
.
.
.
.
.
add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank?
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?
I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
You have Monica Geller here.
Absolutely.
Yeah, send her in.
What the hell is this?
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?
You got it.
I'm sorry.
What?
What's this supposed to mean?
Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.
Are you buying me?
ls this how you get girls to go out with you?
I'm still here.
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip.
.
.
.
.
.
you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument.
.
.
.
.
.
and there wouldn't be this heat between us.
You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
You were the chef and I was the customer.
But now we're this couple that fights.
You're a loon.
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.
I think you're great.
Come on, what do you say?
I don't know.
Why not?
I don't wanna encourage this behavior.
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for.
Please?
We go out, we eat.
If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 1 0 grand, we're even.
Wait, no.
Just put the mail down.
It's me.
Sorry.
Why were you just all in the dark?
Your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.
-Is that all right?
-Yeah, sure.
So how was your day?
It's just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
What happened?
Alice.
.
.
.
She called it off.
Did she say why?
No.
Just that I was too young.
I don't see how I could suddenly be too young.
.
.
.
.
.
because I'm older than I was when we first got together.
I don't know.
But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.
Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.
Oh, sweetie.
You know, I was just finally happy.
For the first time in my life.
.
.
.
.
.
after my dad left me.
.
.
.
.
.
and then getting arrested for stealing those birds.
.
.
.
.
.
and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather.
.
.
.
.
.
but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
And now it's gone, and I don't know why.
Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.
But you know what?
I only did it because I love you, okay?
What?
I kind of had a little chat with Alice.
.
.
.
.
.
and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?
My mother didn't want us to be together.
.
.
.
.
.
but the worst thing she did was tie me to the porch.
I came to you because I thought you'd understand.
I would storm out of here.
.
.
.
.
.
if I had some money or a place to go.
Oh, my God!
The millionaire's here!
Oh, my God!
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.
Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
I know.
Okay, then get the lobster.
How much cash you got in your pocket now?
And that's why I'm not inviting you in for a drink.
Why not?
Hey, come in for drink.
-Where do you wanna go?
-You like pizza?
-That sounds great.
-I know a great little place.
You're not paying for the pizza.
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.
Is that enough lira?
I'd throw another 1 000 on that.
-How much is that?
-That's about 60 cents.
Every night!
You don 't need to smoke.
Cigarettes don 't control you.
You are a strong, confident woman who does not need to smoke.
A strong, confident woman who does not need to smoke.
Look, I know that you think I did this totally evil thing.
But I so didn't.
Someone's here who can explain this better than I can.
Hi, Mrs. Knight.
Phoebe's right, Frank.
It's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.
I was being selfish.
Even though we want the same things right now.
.
.
.
.
.
in the future, we may not.
-Is that what it is?
-Yes, but not just that.
Not just that.
Even though we love each other as much as we do.
.
.
.
.
.
nonetheless.
.
.
.
Nonetheless.
You're too young.
.
.
.
.
.
to really know what you want.
That's right, exactly.
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.
Bye-bye.
The important thing is, is that you see what I'm saying.
This is clearly wrong.
I've decided I'm gonna let this happen.
Can I just get my purse?
Okay, all right, good.
Cigarettes don 't control you.
You are a strong, confident woman who does not need to smoke.
Joey's your best friend.
You wanna make him a cheese sandwich every day.
And you also wanna buy him hundreds of dollars worth ofpants.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
"Say, Rachel l was wondering if you'd go to a movie with me sometime as my lover.
" Too out there.
"Maybe you'd like to have dinner with me sometime as my lover.
" All right, let's go shopping.
Before we go, there's something I need to say.
I've kind of had this crush on you.
Since you were with Ross, I didn't do anything about it.
Now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.
So that's what I'm doing.
.
.
: : :now: I dropped a cup.
The One With the Tiny T-Shirt .
:staz:.
So within a few years, voice recognition.
.
.
.
.
.
will be standard on any computer.
You know, so you could be, like, "Wash my car.
" "Clean my room.
" It won't be able to do any of those things, but it'll understand.
Oh, this was so great.
Yeah, it was.
All right, then.
Bye.
Hello, people who do not live here.
I gave you a key for emergencies.
We were out of Doritos.
Hey, how'd the date go with Mr. Millionaire?
"Mr. Millionaire.
New, from Snooty Playthings.
Third wife sold separately.
" He's great.
We have such a good time together.
He's so funny and so sweet.
And I'm not attracted to him at all!
Still?
It's driving me crazy.
In every other way, he's the perfect guy.
He has everything.
Plus, he actually has everything.
Life-sized lmperial Storm Troopers from Sharper lmage?
Two.
Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
Oh, Mommy!
Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy Oh, Mommy!
Oh, Daddy!
I am a big old baddy I guess he must've gotten the part in that play.
Either that, or Gloria Estefan was right.
Eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.
-Joe, how's it going?
-Good.
So you're playing Adrianne?
Yes.
Are you one of the retarded cousins?
No.
I'm playing your husband, victor.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Kate Miller.
So the play's pretty great, huh?
Oh, yeah.
I love Jennifer Banberry's work.
She's so incisive when it comes to deconstructing the middle class.
Oh, forget about it.
She rocks!
Where do I know you from?
Dr. Drake Ramoray?
Days of our Lives?
voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat?
No, that's not it.
So you're a soap actor.
This must be exciting for you, being in a real play.
Hey, I've done plays before.
I'm a serious actor.
That infomercial!
For the milk-carton-spout thing!
You're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk!
I actually can pour milk.
But I got you believing that I couldn't.
Now, see, that's acting.
Right.
At the end, you choked on a cookie.
That was real.
-I cannot believe Mark asked you out.
-I know.
What are you gonna tell him?
I told him I would think about it, but I'm gonna tell him no.
I think I'd say no to anybody right now.
But it was so strange.
I mean, I'm standing there.
.
.
.
.
.
with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him.
.
.
.
.
.
which I'm allowed to do.
.
.
.
.
.
and I felt guilty, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
Wow.
So, okay, maybe that means.
.
.
.
.
.
you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
-I don't have issues with my father.
-So it's just the Ross thing.
I hate this woman!
I hate her!
She told everyone about that infomercial.
.
.
.
.
.
and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks!
And whenever I can't do it, they're all, like, laughing at me!
So Rachel called.
Wants to see me.
Going over in a minute.
-What do you think she wants?
-Maybe the crazy fog has lifted.
.
.
.
.
.
and she realizes that life without me.
.
.
.
.
.
sucks.
It's possible.
You are very lovable.
I'd miss you if I broke up with you.
Just trying to be supportive.
Be supportive like a guy.
If I broke up with you, I'd miss you.
You wanted to see me?
Here's a box of your stuff.
It's just hats and a shirt and CDS.
Just stuff that you've left here.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to hurt me or something?
It just seems that, you know, it's time we move on.
I mean, don't you think?
-Yes, I do.
-Good.
I really do.
This was a gift.
You got that for free from the museum gift shop.
It's still a gift.
I got it from the "gift" shop.
Okay!
All right!
Give me the mug!
I'll keep the mug!
Don't do me any favors.
In fact.
.
.
.
.
.
where's the rest of my stuff?
Like my.
.
.
.
This book is mine!
And that T-shirt you sleep in?
I'd like that back too.
Yes, I do.
You know how much I love that T-shirt.
You never even wear that T-shirt.
I'm just trying to help you "move on.
" Oh, you are a petty man.
You are a petty, petty.
.
.
-Petty.
.
.
-.
.
.
petty, petty.
.
.
-.
.
.
small.
.
.
.
-.
.
.
small.
.
.
.
You are so just doing this out of spite.
I'm gonna wear this all the time!
I love this shirt!
You haven't worn it since you were 1 5!
It doesn't even fit you anymore!
If you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff.
.
.
.
.
.
and "relax" .
.
.
.
.
.
in my favorite shirt.
You have a pleasant evening.
So you're, like, a zillionaire.
And you're our age.
You're our age.
You know what?
You should buy a state.
.
.
.
.
.
and then just name it after yourself.
Like, "Pete Dakota"?
Or "Mississi-Pete.
" I got it: "Pete Chicago.
" That's not a state, Joe.
Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?
I gotta go.
I'll see you guys later.
You're our age.
So are we on for tomorrow?
Absolutely.
Now, get out of here, you!
Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him.
Is something wrong with me?
Why am I only attracted to guys with no future?
Either they're too old, or they're too young.
And there's Pete, who's crazy about me.
.
.
.
.
.
and he's absolutely perfect, and there's zip going on!
Does it sound like something's wrong with me?
Yeah, kind of.
Happy?
ls that what I'm supposed to be, vic?
Happy?
Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be?
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out!
I talk to you, and nothing!
You look at me, and it's nothing!
Nothing.
Tasty.
I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history.
It's nice.
I have a question about this scene.
I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to victor.
Peel the onion.
First of all, he's good-looking.
My character needs a bit more of a reason than that.
Hey, how about this one?
It says so in the script!
I don't know why my character likes you either.
I mean, it says in the script that you're a bitch.
-It doesn't say that in the script.
-It does in mine.
I can blow-dry it, gel it.
It doesn't matter.
I still wind up with this little.
.
.
.
.
.
cowlick-y thing on the middle part of my head.
It's so annoying.
-Does it bug you?
-You bug me.
Is there any chance you didn't see that?
Ross, you gotta stop, okay?
You can't stare through the peephole for three hours.
You're gonna get peep-eye.
I knew it.
I knew it.
I always knew she liked him.
She'd say no, but here we are.
We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn't "just break up.
" It's been, like, three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.
I mean, bullets have left guns slower.
Here they come!
Here they-- If she kisses him good night, I'll kill myself.
I can't watch.
Come on.
Date over!
Date over!
Here we go.
She's going in.
She's going in.
Wait!
He's going in!
He's going in!
The door's closed!
I can't see anything with the door closed!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
I have to do something.
I have to stop it!
-Stop what?
-I don't know.
But I have a feeling my being there will do it.
I'll go over and I will borrow something!
Juice!
I need juice!
You can't!
-They must be stopped!
-I am your friend.
.
.
.
.
.
and I won't let you do this!
You are surprisingly strong!
-I need juice!
People need juice!
-Look, man.
.
.
.
-People need juice!
-Listen to me!
She's moving on.
If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.
And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole.
.
.
.
.
.
you'll have to get used to the fact that it's over!
Okay, man?
It's over.
It's just I miss her so much.
I know.
Why do your coffee mugs have numbers?
Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.
So if one of them's missing, she can be like, "Where's number 27"?
You know what?
No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.
-I can't do this.
-That's what I didn't want to know.
Oh, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?
I'm doing it to get back at Ross.
I'm sorry.
It's not very fair to you.
Fair, shmair.
You know?
You wanna get back at Ross, I am here for you.
Really.
I say we get back at him right here on this couch.
Right here!
Oh, my God.
I'm sorry about this.
That's okay.
You sure?
I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
--and should become the penicillin of the 2 1st century.
And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps.
.
.
.
.
.
toward leading that revolution.
Can I ask you something?
Where are we?
Well, with all these doctors and nurses.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna say, "Midget Rodeo.
" Just tell me the truth.
You know, I don't think I told you this.
.
.
.
.
.
but I just recently got out of a serious relationship.
Oh, right.
Wasn't that a year ago?
So I did tell you.
That's not really the thing.
I'm just in a place in my life where I need to focus on me.
-Do you know what I mean?
-Oh, I know.
-I so want to be attracted to you.
-But you're not.
Okay.
Good.
I'm sorry.
You know what?
Don't be.
Don't be, because it's not so bad.
It's not?
Yeah.
I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.
Or someone you find attractive.
I just think, you know.
.
.
.
.
.
that you might end up feeling differently.
I don't want this to come out wrong.
.
.
.
.
.
but you're awfully confident for a guy I said I wasn't attracted to.
Stupidly charming, isn't it?
You wanna get something to eat?
This place is kind of depressing.
Now the man who made all of this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.
One second.
I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.
Draw!
I wasn't doing anything.
What did she do now?
Just because she went to Yale, she thinks she's the greatest actress.
.
.
.
.
.
since sliced bread.
Ah, Sliced Bread.
A wonderful Lady Macbeth.
I hate her.
I hate her with her "Oh, I'm so talented" .
.
.
.
.
.
and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good.
" I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
Can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?
I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.
You're out of your mind!
You've done nothing but talk about her for 48 hours.
If you were in school, you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.
Then how come I keep thinking about her.
.
.
.
.
.
in all these sexual scenarios and stuff?
Happy?
ls that what I'm supposed to be, vic?
Happy?
Why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh?
Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.
I talk to you, and it's nothing.
You look at me, and nothing.
Nothing.
You guys make me fly!
High!
Okay, we're gonna pick it up here, tomorrow.
-Well, that was.
.
.
.
-Better?
Yeah, it was definitely.
.
.
.
.
.
an improvement.
-Good night.
-Kate.
You forgot your shoes.
I'm probably gonna need those, huh?
Hey, listen.
.
.
.
.
.
you feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Kate.
.
.
.
.
.
you ready to go?
very nice.
very nice.
-See you tomorrow?
-Yeah.
Sure.
-Right.
-Good night.
Why isn't it "Spiderman"?
Like Goldman, Silverman?
Because it's not his last name.
It isn't?
It's not, like.
.
.
.
.
.
Phil Spiderman.
He's a Spider-.
.
.
: : :man: You know, like, Goldman is a last name.
But there's no Gold Man.
There should be a Gold Man!
-How was work?
-Oh, great.
Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh.
Well, I guess I had that one coming.
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just shampoo and-- Something wrong?
No.
Nothing.
So what kind of powers would "Gold Man" have?
Okay.
Well, he would turn things to gold.
-And things that are already gold?
-His work is done.
Let's play my game.
All right, you yellow-bellied, lily-livered-- Draw!
Yeah, it's fun.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
You're telling me this actress person.
.
.
.
.
.
is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?
Oh, my God.
Is this what it's like to be you?
-You're crazy about her, huh?
-You have no idea.
When we're on stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.
She goes home with the director.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.
Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.
Dad called this morning.
Aunt Sylvia passed away.
We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Am I missing something?
I thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.
Well, Aunt Sylvia was.
.
.
.
.
.
not a nice person.
She was a cruel, cranky old bitch.
And I'm sorry she died.
Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
-You get the dollhouse.
-I get the dollhouse!
A house for dolls!
That is so cool.
When I was a kid, I had a barrel.
You had a barrel for a dollhouse?
No, just a barrel.
You know what?
You can play with my dollhouse.
Really?
Any time you want.
When I was young I wanted to play with this dollhouse.
But no!
It was to be looked at, never played with.
My grandmother said the same thing to me.
The One With the Doll House .
:staz:.
Thanks for lunch.
You didn't have to walk me here.
That's okay.
No problem.
You realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here.
Yes, I realize that.
-Summer catalog.
-That's the stuff.
Rachel, I need the versace invoice.
You don't work for me.
Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing.
Joanna.
Bing?
That's a great name.
It's Gaelic for, "Thy turkey's done.
" -I'm gonna go.
Nice meeting you.
-You too.
So what's wrong with him?
Nothing.
He's just goofy like that.
I actually hardly notice it anymore.
I mean, is he married or involved with anyone?
He's not married or involved with anyone.
Actually, you know what?
Forget it.
-I'll ask him for you, if you want.
-Would you?
Or is it too sad and desperate, like something Sophie would do?
-I am here.
-I know that.
Look at it!
Wallpaper's a little faded.
That's okay.
Carpet's a little loose.
Hardwood floors?
!
-It's so beautiful!
-I know!
So I'm here, ready to play!
I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out.
What's this?
That's a dog.
Every house should have a dog.
Not one that can pee on the roof.
Maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
And is this in case the house sneezes?
No, that's the ghost for the attic.
-I don't want a ghost.
-Well, nobody wants a ghost.
But you've got one.
.
.
.
.
.
because the house is sitting on an ancient lndian burial ground.
Wait a minute.
The house was built on radioactive waste.
.
.
.
.
.
and an ancient lndian burial ground?
That would never happen.
Obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
-I need to talk to you.
-Sure.
What's up?
Oh, sorry.
I meant Chandler.
I know.
Well, if something comes up.
.
.
.
I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
My boss.
Joanna.
When you left.
.
.
.
.
.
she started asking questions about you.
.
.
.
Liked what she saw?
Dug my action, did she?
Checking out the Chan Chan Man!
That was.
.
.
.
.
.
surreal.
What do you think?
Are you interested?
She seemed cool.
Attractive.
I'll do it.
Thank you, Chandler.
This is great.
She's gonna love me.
Dinosaur attack!
Quick, everybody into the house!
All right, Phoebe, you know what?
That's it.
That's it.
No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?
They're not the right size, they're not victorian and they don't go.
Fine.
Come, dinosaur.
We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
While we're on the subject, I have to say that dinosaurs.
.
.
.
.
.
they don't go, "ruff!
" The little ones do.
-Hey, Kate.
-Morning.
I went to that restaurant you talked about-- Hey, lovely.
Come, talk to me for a minute.
I ate the food.
It was good.
I had the fish.
I'm Lauren.
Kate's understudy.
Joey Tribbiani.
I know.
I'm a big fan of yours.
What?
I used to schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray.
.
.
.
.
.
on Days of our Lives.
-Get out of here.
Really?
-Absolutely.
But then they dropped you down that elevator shaft.
They gave me the shaft, all right.
You're so funny.
What are you doing after rehearsal?
You want to get a drink?
Sure.
A drink sounds great.
-Cool.
I'll see you then.
-All right.
All right.
It's time to act, my talking props.
Look everybody!
Look at my new dollhouse!
Look, look!
Hey, what's this?
It's a slide instead of stairs.
Look.
very interesting, Phoebe.
What's this?
The licorice room.
You can eat all the furniture.
And when guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.
This is the coolest house ever!
Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room?
-All right.
-I would.
Hey, guys?
Guys!
Did you see my new china cabinet?
Watch.
Watch.
And?
And?
Hey, my father's house does that.
How did it go?
Tell me everything!
The movie was great.
.
.
.
.
.
dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
Of course, I didn't enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a dull dud!
Chandler is fantastic!
-What?
-You know how people just click?
He came by to pick me up, I opened the door and it was just like, "click!
" Did he tell you?
Doesn't he have a good heart?
And he's so sweet.
He said he'd call, so put him straight through.
-Isn't this great?
-Don't spoil it.
Come on, baby, don't go.
Please?
What do you say?
It's you.
Just one sec.
I'm going to take this call.
When I continue, I hope there will appear on-stage.
.
.
.
.
.
this magical thing that in the theater we call.
.
.
.
.
.committing to the moment!
The guy's like a cartoon.
What do you see in him, anyway?
He happens to be brilliant.
Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
I'm not interested in her sweater.
It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
And besides.
.
.
.
.
.
since when do you care who I'm with?
I don't care.
Why, do you want me to care?
Do you want me to want you to care?
Do you?
What?
Okay.
I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick up where we left off.
Come on, baby, don't go.
Please?
What do you say?
I've got no reason to stay.
Stop!
Stop it!
You must stop!
You are bad actors!
This is a terrible play!
I'll see you in the morning.
I can't believe we go on in a week.
Hey, it's gonna be all right.
Since we're getting off early, do you want to go paint mugs?
What?
At the place I told you about last night?
Yeah, with the mug-painting.
I was so listening to that.
But you know what?
I need to work on my stuff tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Are you okay?
I guess.
What are we gonna do about the scene?
I don't know.
Maybe if it had more heat.
Well, how do you mean?
Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?
victor can't just kiss her.
He's gotta.
.
.
.
.
.
he's gotta give her a reason.
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
Or maybe.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe he could grab her and lift her up.
Then Adrianne could wrap her legs around his waist.
Then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and stomach.
Then he could use his teeth to undo her dress and.
.
.
.
.
.
and bite her!
Then right when the scene ends, he could take her.
.
.
.
.
.
with this raw, animal.
.
.
.
Something like that?
That's pretty much what I had in mind.
It's a little early to be drinking.
Things finally happened with Kate.
You're kidding?
That's great.
It was so amazing.
After the lovemaking.
.
.
Oh, my.
.
.
.
I just watched her sleep for hours.
Just breathing in.
.
.
.
.
.
and breathing out.
I knew she was dreaming because.
.
.
.
.
.
her eyes kept going like this.
I'm telling you, she's got it all wrong.
All I said was, "This was fun.
Let's do it again sometime.
I'll give you a call.
" I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
It's what you say at the end of a date.
You can't just say, "Nice to meet you.
Good night"?
To her face?
I'm standing there.
.
.
.
.
.
she's waiting for me to say I'll call her.
.
.
.
.
.
and it comes out.
I can't help it.
It's a compulsion.
When a guy says he'll call, it doesn't mean he's going to call.
This never happened to you?
Well, they always called.
Bite me.
-Did he call?
-No, sorry.
Why?
He said he'd call.
Why hasn't he called?
Maybe he's intimidated by smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.
Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why?
Maybe he feels awkward because you're my boss.
Awkward?
Why should he feel awkward?
You didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating me.
.
.
.
.
.
there are always ways to fix that.
Call her.
Call her now!
Multiple so many paper cuts.
"Why hasn't he called, Rachel?
Why, why?
I don't understand!
" I'm telling you, she's flipped out!
She's gone crazy!
Well, give me the phone then.
She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.
You have to call her.
You can't call somebody after this long to say: "In case you didn't notice, I don't like you.
" Then you'll have to take her out again.
She's really dull, and she gets this.
.
.
.
.
.
gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don't care!
You'll take her out again and end it.
.
.
.
.
.
in a way she knows it's ended.
I don't care how hard it is.
Don't tell her you'll call her again!
All right, fine!
But just lunch.
From now on, I get my own dates.
I don't want you setting me up again!
That's fine!
-That's just a lot of big talk.
-I know.
I'm in the shower!
Fire!
There's a fire!
Fire!
I talked to Lauren.
I told her how things were with us.
Did you talk to Marshall?
About what?
About what happened with us.
No, there's really no reason why he should find out.
So let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?
What are you talking about?
It was a big deal.
You can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.
I was there.
You're not that good an actress.
I was just caught up in the moment.
That's all it was.
Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad, but.
.
.
.
.
.
haven't you slept with a woman and it meant more to her than to you?
Hi, pig!
Sorry I scared you in there.
It's okay.
By the way.
.
.
.
.
.
I was just checking the shower massager.
I tried to reach you at work.
There's been a fire.
What?
Oh, my God!
What happened?
We believe it originated here.
.
.
.
.
.
in the Aroma Room.
Did everyone get out okay?
The giraffe's okay, and so is the pirate.
-What's this?
-No, don't look!
You don't want to see what's under there!
The foster puppets!
It's not a big deal.
It's right here, and it's all the time.
Thanks again for lunch.
-This was pleasant.
-It was, wasn't it?
-The food there was great.
-Wasn't it?
So take care.
You too.
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again!
Great.
I'm looking forward to it.
-Any messages?
-Sophie's desk.
Are you gonna call her?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.
You are gonna tell her.
You'll tell her now.
I'm not gonna call you.
What?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I said I was going to when I'm not.
This has nothing to do with you.
And this isn't Rachel's fault.
It's me.
I have serious problems when it comes to women.
I have issues with commitment, intimacy.
.
.
: : :mascara goop: I'm really sorry.
It's just that.
.
.
.
.
.
this isn't going to work out.
This isn't how I was hoping this would end.
.
.
.
.
.
but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
I'll give you a call.
We should do it again sometime!
Anyway, Beth, what I'm saying is.
.
.
.
.
.
I should have considered your feelings before I went home with you.
I've recently learned what it's like to be on your side.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm sorry.
Do you think you can forgive me?
Great.
Thanks.
Hello, Jennifer?
Hi, Mrs. Laurio.
Is Jennifer there?
She's not home, huh?
Actually I kind of need to talk to you too.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Whose idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?
Some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
-Oh, my God!
They took my idea!
-That was you?
Okay, there you go.
Rachel, I made you cocoa.
Oh, that's so.
.
.
.
Oh, my God!
Are you guys okay?
Oh, my.
The One With a Chick and a Duck .
:staz:.
You know, with that goatee, you kind of look like Satan.
So that's why the priest threw holy water on me.
You have to cheer up.
You should come out with Ross and me.
Anything is better than sitting here crying all day about Kate.
I was crying because nobody believed Quincy's theory.
I'm gonna be on Tv!
No way!
They're putting together a panel to talk about the fossils in Peru.
The Discovery Channel's filming it!
Oh, my God!
Who's gonna watch that?
Thanks.
You ready to go?
I saw a girl with that vest.
Thanks.
Most of us think of chocolate and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.
Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.
Unfortunately, most of these guys won 't live to see the 4th of July.
As a result of improper care, they will be dead.
You guys got any of those baby chicks?
I was watching this commercial on Tv, and, man, those things are cute!
Pete, you're back!
Hey, check this out!
Skates!
You're sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.
How was your trip?
What'd you bring me?
Hotel toiletries from Japan!
These are gonna go in my permanent collection.
-Want some coffee?
-That'd be great.
Regular or decaf?
Whichever's closest.
-Ask me what I did today.
-What did you do today?
I bought a restaurant and I'd like you to be the chef.
Can you believe he offered me a restaurant?
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?
It's been my dream since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven.
.
.
.
.
.
and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.
I would kill for this job.
I can totally do this job.
.
.
.
.
.
and God knows, I've paid my dues.
But Pete's doing this because he has a crush on me.
And you're still not attracted to him at all?
How could I accept a restaurant from him?
I can't.
I couldn't accept a necklace from Stu vincent in the 7th grade.
But, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.
What, honey?
My side hurts from when you crashed into me.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Oh, God!
Hey, you guys.
Guess what?
Got a job on a riverboat?
I didn't wear this suit for a year, because you hated it.
You're not my girlfriend anymore, so: : : : I see.
This suit is making a point.
Now that you're on your own, you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.
You like it, right?
I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.
What were you gonna tell us?
Was it how you invented the cotton gin?
So after you put the suggestion in the box.
.
.
.
.
.
how long did it take for it to happen?
About three months.
So I guess that's about two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
I got you something.
Open it!
Open it!
It's a chicken.
It's cute, huh?
You guys?
Do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl?
No.
Women?
No.
They are a huge responsibility.
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.
They need just the right food and lots and lots of love.
Well, no problem there.
Easy, Lenny.
So, I mean, have you thought about it?
Okay, here's the thing.
Not "the thing.
" I hate "the thing.
" What's "the thing"?
I can't do it.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could.
.
.
.
.
.
but you have these feelings for me.
That's what you're worried about?
If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
I was gonna tell you over dinner, but I met somebody else, on my trip.
Her name's Ann.
She's a journalist.
We met on the plane.
She wanted to finish off my peanuts.
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.
I got tired of waiting.
That's great.
I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.
-Now I can work for you!
-I guess you can.
Oh, my God!
This is incredible!
You know what?
I'm gonna roll right into that office and quit!
All right!
Could you give me a little push?
Good luck!
I'm quitting!
I'm okay!
I'm all right!
That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.
What?
I'm just saying, this "woman," I mean, she's fictitious, no?
-Why would you say that?
-You're still into Monica.
You said there's somebody else so she'd work with you.
If you spend time together, maybe something might happen.
You're good.
You're good.
No, I'm fairly intuitive.
And psychic.
It's a substantial gift.
Can you promise me that you won't tell her?
Absolutely.
I promise.
Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.
No, I'm serious.
I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Okay, but this is the last time.
With a chick-chick here And a chick-chick there Here a chick, there a chick Everywhere a chick-chick Chicken.
How's she doing?
She?
Don't you think it's a she?
I don't know.
I can't tell.
Whatever it was went back in too quickly.
I gotta change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?
What?
I stayed home while you were at rehearsal.
.
.
.
.
.
so somebody could be here with our chick.
Who was up from 2:00 this morning until 5:00.
.
.
.
.
.
trying to get her back to sleep?
You don't think I get up when you get up?
Oh, here it comes.
Yes!
Here it comes!
I'm stuck here all day!
And then you come in and spend two seconds with us.
.
.
.
.
.
and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
Well, I don't think so, mister!
I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.
And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
That's not what I said.
I just meant-- I know what you meant!
Did you notice that ever since we got this chick.
.
.
.
.
.
we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
I'll take her back tomorrow.
We'll get our $3 back?
I have that Tv thing in two hours, and I need your help.
What do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?
The brown one brings out your eyes.
But your butt looks great in the blue one.
Really?
That aspirin dance really works.
-Is that still.
.
.
?
-I'm fine.
-No, you're not!
-Yes, I am.
Look, I'm fine.
Watch.
Look at that.
You've got to go to a doctor, okay?
I have to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss's house.
There's people there that I have to meet.
I'm sure you'll make a great impression.
"Hi, I'm Rachel.
It's nice to meet you.
" Come on, you probably have a broken rib.
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.
But you know, I could use a hand getting ready.
Either help me, or go.
Fine.
I'll go.
But before you go, could you help me first?
Sure.
I'll help you.
Good!
Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a vCR?
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.
Would you please help me with this too?
Let's use this brush.
-This stuff?
-Careful.
Light.
Just sweep it across the lid.
Just sweep it.
Sorry!
That's just poking me in the eye.
I'm sorry.
Close.
.
.
.
-Just sweep it.
-I'm sweeping.
Sweep, sweep.
.
.
.
Now make it even, because we don't.
.
.
.
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.
You don't wear enough of this.
Since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
Close your eye.
You're gonna like this better.
.
.
.
-Close, close.
-Blow it.
Because I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Sophisticated like a hooker?
-Guess what I'm doing tonight.
-What?
I'm checking out the restaurant with Pete.
Monica, I am so excited for you!
I have to tell you something.
What?
I can't tell you.
Wouldn't it be easier to tell me something that you could tell me?
Well, sure, in a perfect world.
But no.
I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to all my Gods.
Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?
Does it have to do with Joey?
Does it have to do with Chandler and that sock he keeps by his bed?
No, but let's come back to that later.
There you go!
Good enough for your party?
Sure.
Sure.
I'll just sit next to the transsexual from purchasing.
All right, I gotta go, So good luck at the party.
Could you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure.
Great.
Okay, just turn around.
What?
I don't want you to see me naked.
I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.
I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your bellybutton.
Yeah, but that was different.
We were going out then.
Now it's weird.
Rach, you know, I can see you naked anytime I want.
What?
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See?
Ross, stop that!
Come on!
Don't think of me like that anymore.
Sorry.
Nothing you can do about it.
It's one of my rights as the ex-boyfriend.
Stop it!
Cut it out!
Cut it out!
I'm sorry.
It will never happen-- Wait a minute!
Wait, wait.
.
.
.
Now there are 1 00 of you, and I'm the king!
Would you grow up?
It's no big deal.
All right.
Fine.
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.
Oh, my God.
All right, look, look.
.
.
.
Easy.
Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?
I do.
I really do.
I'll get your coat, then I'll put you in a cab.
You're not gonna come with me?
Of course I am.
I just have to make a call.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry.
I just can't go to the hospital looking like this.
Does it involve travel?
Does it involve clogs?
Clogs or claws?
Clogs.
Claws?
So it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey.
What about Pete?
What is it?
-What about Pete?
-I don't know!
I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.
-Phoebe, would you just tell me?
-I can't!
-I gotta go.
-But you're so close!
Something to do with Pete's company?
Go!
You'll never get it!
I know.
See, yes.
That's Yasmine Bleeth.
She's a completely different kind of chick.
I love you both.
But in very different ways.
What are you doing?
You were gonna take her back.
I did.
But the store wouldn't take her back.
Then I took her to the shelter.
You know what I found out?
If they can't find a home for her, they kill her!
I won't let that happen to little Jasmine.
Good, good, because I was kind of having second thoughts too.
And it's not just chicks.
It's all kinds of other animals.
That's horrible.
You did the right thing.
Thanks.
I'm glad you see it that way.
Funny story!
I don't believe this!
Look at this refrigerator!
It's gigantic!
I could live in this thing!
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold!
Oh, my God!
Look at these spider burners!
I love spider burners!
So you like it?
It is so perfect!
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?
No!
No way!
What?
-Oh, God.
-What?
You still have feelings for me.
I'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.
I love you.
Is that so bad?
No, it's not bad.
It's not bad at all.
It's really nice.
The only one who stands to get hurt is me, and I'm okay with that.
You may be okay with getting hurt.
.
.
.
.
.
but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you.
That's why I can't take this job.
What?
We probably shouldn't see each other anymore.
I'm sorry.
I mean, if that's really what you want, okay.
I'm sorry things-- Shut up for a second and let me just see something.
You'd tell me the truth?
Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
Now you stay out here and you think about what you did!
-That's a duck!
-That's a bad duck!
How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
What thing?
What thing?
Nothing.
There was this thing at the museum.
Come on.
Easy.
Now, when you come back, I hope you remember that that chick is not a toy!
What "thing"?
What is this "thing"?
I was kind of supposed to be on Tv tonight for the Discovery Channel.
Oh, my God!
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go.
.
.
.
.
.
and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight.
Come on.
-I cannot believe you.
-What?
That is the sweetest thing.
You should get some sleep.
Sorry I spoiled your evening.
As long as you're okay.
So I'll see you tomorrow.
See you.
What did you do?
What you doing?
Having a swim.
What about the chick?
Chicks don't swim.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
-Should we try?
-Sure.
See, I told you.
They don't swim.
Well, give him a minute.
It's okay.
It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Are you still on hold?
I was supposed to call my dad back two hours ago.
Oh, yeah.
He clicked on.
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.
What's Flimbees?
That's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Okay, hang up!
That's it.
Come on!
No.
That's what they want me to do.
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through.
.
.
.
.
.
they won't fix my crappy, broken phone for free!
We cannot let them win!
It's us versus them!
Yes!
I gotta double-check for tickets tonight.
Who got what?
I have one.
I need two.
I'm bringing Pete.
My boyfriend.
I have a boyfriend now.
Two it is.
How about you?
Yeah, I also need two.
Really?
Who's number two?
Whose Number Two?
One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
No, it's just this person.
Like a date-type person?
Yeah, kind of.
It's this woman from work.
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?
Not at all.
I was actually gonna bring someone myself.
But you said one ticket.
I meant me plus one.
Okay.
Did you guys mean you plus one?
All right.
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay, I need a date!
Oh, hey!
You guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
And I borrowed your cologne.
I hope she likes it.
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Worm medicine for the duck.
The One With the Screamer .
:staz:.
-Here you go.
You can wear this.
-Thanks.
I'm setting the phone down.
But I'm still here.
Just don't go anywhere.
I'm still here.
Don't switch or anything, because I'm right here.
Just one sec.
One sec.
One second!
Wait!
One second!
Just.
.
.
.
What?
Monica, I'm scared!
Honey, that's a sleeve.
And we also have a speakerphone.
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm the next caller!
You were gonna have me hang up.
Can you take a duck and a chick to the theater?
Of course not.
I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good.
-Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Looks that way.
First ones here!
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Cailin.
Cailin-- Sorry.
And break!
I think I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
-I'll join you.
-I'll get our seats.
Well, this is.

awkward.
Well, because Rachel and I used to go out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, then this is awkward.
-So what do you.
.
.
?
-I think we're here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I think you may be in our seats.
No, I don't think so.
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" .
.
.
.
Oh, well, I thought that-- You thought?
Well, that didn't really work out for you.
Idiot!
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D-1 3" !
Okay?
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?
-The usher told me-- -The usher must be right!
With all his training!
Get out!
Here!
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, I'm good.
-There he is!
-There's our star!
You were great!
So?
What'd you think?
Almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
-I wasn't in that.
-I know.
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sweetheart!
Come!
So that's the girl you like.
I tell you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy.
He viciously screamed at total strangers.
I think he's bad news.
Wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
Well, that's odd.
Oh, hey, Lauren.
You guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.
I ran into you in the hallway in your building.
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.
So how'd you guys meet?
The short version is, I pursued her for a couple of months.
Then I gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
In the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do?
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!
Do they have representation?
They weren't in the play.
We're not actors.
What a shame!
With her face and her chest, I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
Hi.
Remember me?
Hi.
Yeah.
Tommy's in line for the bathroom.
.
.
.
.
.
and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.
I'm gonna go.
Go?
Why?
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like.
.
.
.
.
.
waiting all night for a guy who may or may not scream.
He definitely will scream.
Goodbye.
Here we go, people!
"Boxing Day.
The Lucille Lortel Theatre.
.
.
.
Joey Tribbiani gives an uneven performance.
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst thing in this production.
" Yes!
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.
" Here it is!
"The direction.
.
.
.
.
.
by Marshall Townend is.
.
.
.
" Thank you, boys and girls.
You've ruined my life.
Please stuff your talentless faces.
.
.
.
.
.
with my mother's crab cakes!
Excuse me!
Does anyone mind if I save this?
-Is the play over?
-Where were you?
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.
You were "the next caller" hours ago.
You must be going crazy.
I've kept myself busy.
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in her room and her stuff in your room.
You okay?
Fabulous.
Drama critics, they're nothing but people who couldn't make it as actors.
-You know what to do?
-Become a drama critic.
I am hurt!
A plague.
.
.
.
.
.
on both your houses!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Oh, classy.
I sure know how to pick them.
You know I gave up a part on a soap for this?
I gave up a job too.
-Really?
What?
-Declawing cats.
Hey, tell you what, let me walk you home.
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn every copy of The Times and The Post.
-Why The Post?
-You didn't see The Post?
-No.
You?
-No.
Why?
You really think these newspapers are just jealous of me?
Absolutely.
You're talented and you're good-looking.
You're sweet and cute.
I know.
That's why they trashed me.
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
-What?
I don't get you.
I mean, first you hate me.
Then you sleep with me.
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?
You never went out with an actress before?
Kate, do you even like me?
-Of course I do.
-So how come you blew me off?
-How come you were with him?
-I don't know.
I just do this.
I always have to pick, like, the smartest guy.
.
.
.
.
.
or the most talented guy.
Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Thanks.
You know what I mean.
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.
You're just so.
.
.
.
You're so.
.
.
: : :so: : : : Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.
Good night.
Sweet dreams.
I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.
This isn't healthy.
No, no, I'm fine.
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.
Didn't you have that on last night?
I stayed at Kate's but nothing happened.
Hey, where were you?
I'm so, so sorry.
I am definitely gonna see your play.
I swear, your play is very important to us.
Thank you for your patience.
Your play is the next play I'm gonna see.
How'd it go with Kate?
It was great!
I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected.
Then she passed out.
But then she woke up.
And we stayed up all night talking.
And now we're crazy about each other!
You had "the night" !
When two people realize their feelings for each other.
.
.
.
.
.
and they talk for hours and learn all about the other person.
You think?
-Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers.
One died!
Yes!
This is from the woman at the bar.
Sorry.
She thought you were somebody else.
-What time is it?
-One.
Watch doesn't work.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.
Look, I wasn't gonna say anything to you, but.
.
.
.
All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don't?
The guy is mean.
I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.
Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
It's not just because I'm jealous.
I mean, I'm not.
I'm not jealous.
Look, the guy actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play.
.
.
.
.
.
he got up, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
You don't want to believe me, that's fine.
We're kidding.
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you.
Mr. Funny!
-Sorry, Tommy.
-What's in the cup?
What is in the cup?
Okay, it's coffee.
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.
-It's hot-- -Hot coffee!
You idiot!
You gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?
What are you?
Just a big, stupid doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?
What's your favorite thing about summertime?
Going to the beach when it stays light real late.
What's your favorite thing about summer?
I don't know.
Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
That's a good one.
Sorry!
Sorry I'm late!
My duck and my chick had a fight.
It was ugly.
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!
vic!
Where have you been, baby?
Where's Kate?
She got a job in L.A. I've been waiting up all night for you.
Where have you been?
Where have you been, vic?
Go to the window.
I wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What do you got down there, vic?
What do you got under that tarp?
When is she leaving?
Tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm coming up!
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?
Use ours across the hall because she.
.
.
.
.
.
has problems.
Thanks.
Sorry, Tommy.
I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No, but.
.
.
.
.
.
it's hot.
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.
I can't believe no one believes me.
I do.
I believe you.
You do?
Yeah.
But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey there, little fella.
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?
Gross!
Idiot!
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!
"Oh, look at me!
I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!
" You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?
What are you quacking about?
Dumb Donald Dodo!
Step away from the duck.
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.
Sorry you went doody in my hand!
I guess we're not going out anymore.
Man!
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.
What's all this about L.A.?
They still want me for General Hospital.
But.
.
.
.
.
.
what about us?
Last night was wonderful.
But I can't stay here just for you.
So stay for the museums.
-I'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage!
At least stay till the end of the play.
I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.
Where are you, vic?
Flight's in an hour.
I gotta go.
vic?
vic?
-vic!
-In a minute!
So this is it, victor?
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Listen.
.
.
.
.
.
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say it quick because this is killing me.
One thing you gotta know is that I will never forget you.
But you got things you have to do now.
And so do l. And so.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna get on this spaceship.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7 in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return .
.
.
you'll be long gone.
.
.
.
.
.
but I won't have aged at all.
So you tell your great, great granddaughter.
.
.
.
.
.
to look me up.
Because, Adrianne.
.
.
.
.
.
baby.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna want to meet her.
So long, vic!
It's been two days.
Yeah, I know.
Good thing it's one of those Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
It has to be 800 because all those big companies have 800 numbers.
Every.
.
.
.
Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.
And yet she's still not hanging up the phone.
-Hang up!
-Hang up the phone!
Fine!
Fine!
Well, I think I broke it.
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby?
We could call it Chuck.
Or Dick.
Listen, I need a favor.
I was in the shower, and as I was.
.
.
.
.
.
cleansing myself, I felt something.
Was it like a sneeze, only better?
No.
I mean, like, a thing on my body.
Well, what was it?
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not.
.
.
.
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys.
.
.
.
.
.
could help me out.
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!
Well, what is it?
ls it a mole?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Is it--?
What, a pimple?
No, it's.
.
.
.
.
.
fancier than a pimple.
-Ross, just go see a doc-- -Guys, what's--?
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.
Yeah, right.
The One With Ross' Thing .
:staz:.
And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.
-Good deal.
-These are my friends.
People?
This is vince.
vince, the people.
vince is a fireman.
Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building?
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.
If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 1 00.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right.
I know.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.
See you Saturday.
He's cute, Pheebs.
But you just started dating that teacher.
Oh, Jason?
We're seeing each other tonight.
Well, Pheebs?
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.
You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.
So do they know about each other?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
Okay, no, they don't know.
Hey, guys.
-Well?
-How'd it go at the doctor's?
He said there's definitely nothing to worry about.
It's benign.
-What is it?
-He couldn't even tell me.
He said it was just some sort of "skin abnormality.
" The worse thing is, he said, being unable to identify it.
.
.
.
.
.
he was reluctant to remove it.
You should go to my guy.
Because when I went in there with my third nipple.
.
.
.
.
.
he just lopped it right off.
So I guess I'm lucky.
I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was.
You know?
Yours had a name.
Maybe they'll name yours after you.
You know?
They'd call it "The Ross.
" And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross.
" Yeah, that'd be cool.
Pete's breaking up with me.
What?
I just checked my messages.
He said that when he gets back, "We need to talk.
" -And?
-Well, that's it.
People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.
That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.
Really?
Maybe he just cheated on you.
I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool.
.
.
.
.
.
knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
That is so great.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
We'd better call the fire department.
Well, we don't need a fireman.
We need, like, a good mechanic.
Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!
Wait.
Why?
If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.
That's all it is.
A third nipple.
You know?
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.
What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well, that's not a third nipple.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well, then what is it?
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
-Jansen, come in here.
-I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.
I gotta go water Pete's plants.
You know what?
lf he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water them.
If he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should do it.
.
.
.
.
.
if you know what I mean.
Or.
.
.
.
.
.
we could go and pee on them.
I can't take it, you know.
I'm afraid one of them will catch me with the other.
It's making me crazy!
Why don't you break up with one of them?
What happened to playing the field?
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.
So pick one of them.
Which one do you like more?
vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.
He's just so burly, so very burly.
Okay, good.
So there you go.
Go with vince.
But Jason's really sensitive.
Sensitive is important.
Pick him.
Oh, sure.
Go with the sissy.
Jason is not a sissy.
I meant Chandler.
You know, I have dinner plans.
Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm stumped.
Okay, this is the den.
All right, check this out.
Lights!
All right, less lights!
Bad lights!
Lights, go away!
See?
You just need the right command.
And the dimmer switch.
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.
That's the video phone.
But you shouldn't be here.
So don't touch anything.
IKEA, this is comfortable!
This place is amazing!
-Oh, God!
That's the nicest kitchen.
-I know.
It's the nicest kitchen.
The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.
Joey, put that down.
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!
How the hell do you answer a video phone?
I guess that's how.
Monica, how's it going?
Oh, it's good.
It's good.
Just here, watering the plants.
Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.
Chandler's on the couch!
I see him.
You guys are the worst hiders, ever.
-Hi.
-How you doing?
The other day when you said you needed to talk.
.
.
.
.
.
just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.
Hold on a second, I have another call.
How's it going?
It's still me.
I've got picture-in-picture here.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.
Monica?
You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
So I'll see you soon.
-Okay.
I love you.
-I love you.
We love you too!
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.
-What do you think the good news is?
-Look at this!
He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.
" Sorry.
What do you think the good news is?
Oh, my!
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom!
Call Mom!
And that's Pete's mom.
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be: "Look How Much Money We've Got!
" I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
You could have, like, little-money place settings.
And you could start with a money salad.
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop?
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.
On your first date, you went to Rome.
For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.
She can't just rush into this.
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!
I gotta go.
I have to break up with vince.
So you're going with the teacher?
I like vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive.
In the long run, I think sensitive is better than having.
.
.
.
.
.
a really, really, really nice body.
Jason.
Definitely Jason.
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck!
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Excuse me.
Is vince here?
Oh, sure.
I didn't know you guys actually used those.
So what's up?
This isn't gonna be easy.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Good deal.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
It's just that I thought we had something pretty special here.
I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.
There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.
My God!
I didn't know you were so-- I'm sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.
Thanks.
But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.
When girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body.
.
.
.
.
.
they tell their friends about it.
Give me that.
Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Bride's Magazines?
I know you said you'd say no if he asked you.
.
.
.
.
.
but how great would you look walking down the aisle.
.
.
.
.
.
in this Donna Karan?
You so would!
You should get that anyway.
Well, for clubbing.
It is so weird.
I know what I said.
But this morning.
.
.
.
.
.
I was lying in bed, imagining what it'd be like to say yes.
I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's not like me to do something like this.
But it doesn't mean I can't.
Right?
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.
And I know that we want the same things.
And when I thought about saying yes.
.
.
.
.
.
it made me really happy.
Oh, my God!
I know.
I need more pie.
Mon, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
That was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.
He keeps a journal and he paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So will you dump Jason?
Yeah, because I have to break up with someone.
So Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is vince.
Plus, vince has the body.
You know?
So.
.
.
.
It's really just about the math.
Come on in.
You sounded serious on the phone.
Is anything wrong?
You must be Ross.
I am Guru Saj.
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so.
.
.
.
Well, relax.
If it makes you feel any better, I've attended.
.
.
.
.
.
fine medical schools in Central America.
Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
Come on, have a seat.
As I suspected, it's a kundus.
What's a "kundus"?
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?
Please lie down.
I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
I guess it's worth a try.
Sure.
We should see results-- Clearly not the way to go!
What?
What?
We appear to have angered it.
We?
We angered it?
I think I see the problem.
And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
Love.
Oh, God!
There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off.
.
.
.
.
.
unless you start to.
.
.
.
What was that?
Well, it's gone.
How's that?
Got caught in my watch.
Lights.
Romantic lights.
Nice.
So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right.
I'd completely forgot about that.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
And I look at my life.
.
.
.
.
.
and I feel like I've conquered the business world.
And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.
And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
But there's one thing missing.
What's that?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
I wanna become.
.
.
.
.
.
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?
I wanna be the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
It's the most intense physical competition in the world.
It's banned in 49 states.
What are you talking about?
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me.
.
.
.
.
.
Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.
I even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
I want you there, in the front row, when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt Crazy underwear Always in a rut Crazy underwear What is he doing here?
All right, just keep playing.
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.
Okay, thank you.
And as always, no one talk to me after the show.
I was passing by and saw you were playing.
This is cool, seeing you up there.
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?
I don't know!
He just started kissing me.
Get him, vince!
What?
I've been dating both of you.
And it's been really horrible, because it's been.
.
.
.
.
.
a lot of fun for me.
But I like you both.
.
.
.
.
.
and I didn't know how to choose.
So I'm sorry.
I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person.
Relax.
It's okay.
I mean.
.
.
.
We never said this was exclusive.
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.
Really?
We haven't been going out that long.
Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.
You haven't?
You have?
Well, this is none of my business.
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?
Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
That could've been really awkward.
You made him a candlelight dinner in the park?
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.
I can't believe I went out with somebody.
.
.
.
.
.
who'd have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area!
Everything's gonna be all right.
Okay, Dick?
Hello.
I am Guru Saj.
He's a duck, right?
Because otherwise.
.
.
.
.
.
this is way out of my league.
He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't stop it.
Is there something you can do?
Let me see.
Let me see.
Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Are you still on hold?
I was supposed to call my dad back two hours ago.
Oh, yeah.
He clicked on.
Call him as soon as you get a chance.
He's at Flimbees.
What's Flimbees?
That's the word I use when I can't remember the real thing.
Okay, hang up!
That's it.
Come on!
No.
That's what they want me to do.
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through.
.
.
.
.
.
they won't fix my crappy, broken phone for free!
We cannot let them win!
It's us versus them!
Yes!
I gotta double-check for tickets tonight.
Who got what?
I have one.
I need two.
I'm bringing Pete.
My boyfriend.
I have a boyfriend now.
Two it is.
How about you?
Yeah, I also need two.
Really?
Who's number two?
Whose Number Two?
One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
No, it's just this person.
Like a date-type person?
Yeah, kind of.
It's this woman from work.
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?
Not at all.
I was actually gonna bring someone myself.
But you said one ticket.
I meant me plus one.
Okay.
Did you guys mean you plus one?
All right.
I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Okay, I need a date!
Oh, hey!
You guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!
And I borrowed your cologne.
I hope she likes it.
What are you doing?
She's seeing somebody.
Yeah, and I don't have any cologne.
-Bottle next to the shaving cream.
-Worm medicine for the duck.
The One With the Screamer GELULA & CO.
, INC.
-Here you go.
You can wear this.
-Thanks.
I'm setting the phone down.
But I'm still here.
Just don't go anywhere.
I'm still here.
Don't switch or anything, because I'm right here.
Just one sec.
One sec.
One second!
Wait!
One second!
Just.
.
.
.
What?
Monica, I'm scared!
Honey, that's a sleeve.
And we also have a speakerphone.
Please stay on the line.
Your call is important to us.
You gotta hang up.
We'll be late.
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.
Yes!
Yes!
I'm the next caller!
You were gonna have me hang up.
Can you take a duck and a chick to the theater?
Of course not.
I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
Oh, hi, how are you?
Good.
-Looks like we're the first ones here.
-Looks that way.
First ones here!
Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Cailin.
Cailin-- Sorry.
And break!
I think I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
-I'll join you.
-I'll get our seats.
Well, this is.
.
.
.
.
.
awkward.
Well, because Rachel and I used to go out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Well, then this is awkward.
-So what do you.
.
.
?
-I think we're here.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I think you may be in our seats.
No, I don't think so.
-Could we take a look at your ticket?
-Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah, see, this says, "D-1 3" .
.
.
.
Oh, well, I thought that-- You thought?
Well, that didn't really work out for you.
Idiot!
What are you, a moron?
It says, "D-1 3" !
Okay?
You're surrounded by even numbers!
Does that give you a clue?
-The usher told me-- -The usher must be right!
With all his training!
Get out!
Here!
-Hey, man, you want the aisle?
-No, I'm good.
-There he is!
-There's our star!
You were great!
So?
What'd you think?
Almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
-I wasn't in that.
-I know.
I want you to meet everybody.
Everybody, this is Kate.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Sweetheart!
Come!
So that's the girl you like.
I tell you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy.
He viciously screamed at total strangers.
I think he's bad news.
Wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
Well, that's odd.
Oh, hey, Lauren.
You guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.
I ran into you in the hallway in your building.
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.
So how'd you guys meet?
The short version is, I pursued her for a couple of months.
Then I gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
In the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!
You guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do?
Oh, you two girls were outstanding!
Do they have representation?
They weren't in the play.
We're not actors.
What a shame!
With her face and her chest, I could really put something together.
Could I borrow it?
Hi.
Remember me?
Hi.
Yeah.
Tommy's in line for the bathroom.
.
.
.
.
.
and someone just cut.
I think he's gonna snap.
I'm gonna go.
Go?
Why?
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like.
.
.
.
.
.
waiting all night for a guy who may or may not scream.
He definitely will scream.
Goodbye.
Here we go, people!
"Boxing Day.
The Lucille Lortel Theatre.
.
.
.
Joey Tribbiani gives an uneven performance.
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst thing in this production.
" Yes!
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered portrayal is laughable.
" Here it is!
"The direction.
.
.
.
.
.
by Marshall Townend is.
.
.
.
" Thank you, boys and girls.
You've ruined my life.
Please stuff your talentless faces.
.
.
.
.
.
with my mother's crab cakes!
Excuse me!
Does anyone mind if I save this?
-Is the play over?
-Where were you?
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.
You were "the next caller" hours ago.
You must be going crazy.
I've kept myself busy.
Okay, yeah, I put your stuff in her room and her stuff in your room.
You okay?
Fabulous.
Drama critics, they're nothing but people who couldn't make it as actors.
-You know what to do?
-Become a drama critic.
I am hurt!
A plague.
.
.
.
.
.
on both your houses!
By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
Oh, classy.
I sure know how to pick them.
You know I gave up a part on a soap for this?
I gave up a job too.
-Really?
What?
-Declawing cats.
Hey, tell you what, let me walk you home.
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn every copy of The Times and The Post.
-Why The Post?
-You didn't see The Post?
-No.
You?
-No.
Why?
You really think these newspapers are just jealous of me?
Absolutely.
You're talented and you're good-looking.
You're sweet and cute.
I know.
That's why they trashed me.
-Wait.
Wait a minute.
-What?
I don't get you.
I mean, first you hate me.
Then you sleep with me.
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?
You never went out with an actress before?
Kate, do you even like me?
-Of course I do.
-So how come you blew me off?
-How come you were with him?
-I don't know.
I just do this.
I always have to pick, like, the smartest guy.
.
.
.
.
.
or the most talented guy.
Why can't I just pick someone like you?
Thanks.
You know what I mean.
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.
You're just so.
.
.
.
You're so.
.
.
: : :so: : : : Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.
Good night.
Sweet dreams.
I'm gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Please stay on the line.
Your call is very important to us.
You've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep.
This isn't healthy.
No, no, I'm fine.
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.
Didn't you have that on last night?
I stayed at Kate's but nothing happened.
Hey, where were you?
I'm so, so sorry.
I am definitely gonna see your play.
I swear, your play is very important to us.
Thank you for your patience.
Your play is the next play I'm gonna see.
How'd it go with Kate?
It was great!
I walked her home, and it was amazing how much we connected.
Then she passed out.
But then she woke up.
And we stayed up all night talking.
And now we're crazy about each other!
You had "the night" !
When two people realize their feelings for each other.
.
.
.
.
.
and they talk for hours and learn all about the other person.
You think?
-Did you learn about her family?
-Two brothers.
One died!
Yes!
This is from the woman at the bar.
Sorry.
She thought you were somebody else.
-What time is it?
-One.
Watch doesn't work.
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.
Look, I wasn't gonna say anything to you, but.
.
.
.
All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
You don't?
The guy is mean.
I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.
Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
It's not just because I'm jealous.
I mean, I'm not.
I'm not jealous.
Look, the guy actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
Yeah, and at the end of the play.
.
.
.
.
.
he got up, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
You don't want to believe me, that's fine.
We're kidding.
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you.
Mr. Funny!
-Sorry, Tommy.
-What's in the cup?
What is in the cup?
Okay, it's coffee.
Iced coffee?
Tell me it's iced coffee.
-It's hot-- -Hot coffee!
You idiot!
You gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?
What are you?
Just a big, stupid doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?
What's your favorite thing about summertime?
Going to the beach when it stays light real late.
What's your favorite thing about summer?
I don't know.
Probably the smell of freshly cut grass.
That's a good one.
Sorry!
Sorry I'm late!
My duck and my chick had a fight.
It was ugly.
We held the curtain for you.
Let's go!
vic!
Where have you been, baby?
Where's Kate?
She got a job in L.A. I've been waiting up all night for you.
Where have you been?
Where have you been, vic?
Go to the window.
I wanna run down to the truck and show you something.
What do you got down there, vic?
What do you got under that tarp?
When is she leaving?
Tonight.
What are you doing?
I'm coming up!
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?
Use ours across the hall because she.
.
.
.
.
.
has problems.
Thanks.
Sorry, Tommy.
I almost spilled this hot coffee on you.
Yeah, but you didn't.
No, but.
.
.
.
.
.
it's hot.
Would you stop it?
It's getting really old.
I can't believe no one believes me.
I do.
I believe you.
You do?
Yeah.
But I also believed her when she said I was next.
Hey there, little fella.
Mr. Fuzzy Man, how you doing?
Gross!
Idiot!
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!
"Oh, look at me!
I'm so cute!
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!
" You're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?
What are you quacking about?
Dumb Donald Dodo!
Step away from the duck.
Sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.
Sorry you went doody in my hand!
I guess we're not going out anymore.
Man!
Joey, I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.
What's all this about L.A.?
They still want me for General Hospital.
But.
.
.
.
.
.
what about us?
Last night was wonderful.
But I can't stay here just for you.
So stay for the museums.
-I'm sorry.
-Joey, on-stage!
At least stay till the end of the play.
I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.
Where are you, vic?
Flight's in an hour.
I gotta go.
vic?
vic?
-vic!
-In a minute!
So this is it, victor?
Yeah.
I guess it is.
Listen.
.
.
.
.
.
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say it quick because this is killing me.
One thing you gotta know is that I will never forget you.
But you got things you have to do now.
And so do l. And so.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna get on this spaceship.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7 in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return .
.
.
you'll be long gone.
.
.
.
.
.
but I won't have aged at all.
So you tell your great, great granddaughter.
.
.
.
.
.
to look me up.
Because, Adrianne.
.
.
.
.
.
baby.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm gonna want to meet her.
So long, vic!
It's been two days.
Yeah, I know.
Good thing it's one of those Phoebe, 800 is toll free.
It has to be 800 because all those big companies have 800 numbers.
Every.
.
.
.
Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I will pay you back.
And yet she's still not hanging up the phone.
-Hang up!
-Hang up the phone!
Fine!
Fine!
Well, I think I broke it.
But that's all right.
Here's the number where you can call.
Wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a baby?
We could call it Chuck.
Or Dick.
Listen, I need a favor.
I was in the shower, and as I was.
.
.
.
.
.
cleansing myself, I felt something.
Was it like a sneeze, only better?
No.
I mean, like, a thing on my body.
Well, what was it?
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not.
.
.
.
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys.
.
.
.
.
.
could help me out.
Come on, you guys!
It's no big deal!
Well, what is it?
ls it a mole?
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
Is it--?
What, a pimple?
No, it's.
.
.
.
.
.
fancier than a pimple.
-Ross, just go see a doc-- -Guys, what's--?
Well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.
Yeah, right.
The One With Ross' Thing GELULA & CO.
, INC.
And this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.
-Good deal.
-These are my friends.
People?
This is vince.
vince, the people.
vince is a fireman.
Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building?
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.
If Joey and I play with matches, we could get you up to an even 1 00.
Fire safety is not a joke, son.
You're right.
I know.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm on call tonight.
See you Saturday.
He's cute, Pheebs.
But you just started dating that teacher.
Oh, Jason?
We're seeing each other tonight.
Well, Pheebs?
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field.
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats.
You know, this kind of, like, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.
So do they know about each other?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
Okay, no, they don't know.
Hey, guys.
-Well?
-How'd it go at the doctor's?
He said there's definitely nothing to worry about.
It's benign.
-What is it?
-He couldn't even tell me.
He said it was just some sort of "skin abnormality.
" The worse thing is, he said, being unable to identify it.
.
.
.
.
.
he was reluctant to remove it.
You should go to my guy.
Because when I went in there with my third nipple.
.
.
.
.
.
he just lopped it right off.
So I guess I'm lucky.
I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.
At least they knew what yours was.
You know?
Yours had a name.
Maybe they'll name yours after you.
You know?
They'd call it "The Ross.
" And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross.
" Yeah, that'd be cool.
Pete's breaking up with me.
What?
I just checked my messages.
He said that when he gets back, "We need to talk.
" -And?
-Well, that's it.
People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.
That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.
Really?
Maybe he just cheated on you.
I won't get rich doing it, but I gotta say, it's cool.
.
.
.
.
.
knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
That is so great.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
We'd better call the fire department.
Well, we don't need a fireman.
We need, like, a good mechanic.
Here they come!
We gotta get out of here!
Wait.
Why?
If I wanted to see a fireman, I'd date one.
That's all it is.
A third nipple.
You know?
Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple.
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.
Take your shirt off.
Let's see what we're dealing with.
What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.
Well, that's not a third nipple.
First of all, it's on your ass.
Well, then what is it?
Wait a minute.
Hold it.
-Jansen, come in here.
-I'm with Hamilton!
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.
I gotta go water Pete's plants.
You know what?
lf he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water them.
If he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should do it.
.
.
.
.
.
if you know what I mean.
Or.
.
.
.
.
.
we could go and pee on them.
I can't take it, you know.
I'm afraid one of them will catch me with the other.
It's making me crazy!
Why don't you break up with one of them?
What happened to playing the field?
It doesn't feel like playing anymore.
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.
So pick one of them.
Which one do you like more?
vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.
He's just so burly, so very burly.
Okay, good.
So there you go.
Go with vince.
But Jason's really sensitive.
Sensitive is important.
Pick him.
Oh, sure.
Go with the sissy.
Jason is not a sissy.
I meant Chandler.
You know, I have dinner plans.
Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years.
.
.
.
.
.
and I'm stumped.
Okay, this is the den.
All right, check this out.
Lights!
All right, less lights!
Bad lights!
Lights, go away!
See?
You just need the right command.
And the dimmer switch.
For a rich guy, that's a small Tv.
That's the video phone.
But you shouldn't be here.
So don't touch anything.
IKEA, this is comfortable!
This place is amazing!
-Oh, God!
That's the nicest kitchen.
-I know.
It's the nicest kitchen.
The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Look, a millionaire's checkbook.
Joey, put that down.
Oh, my God, that's Pete.
Get out!
How the hell do you answer a video phone?
I guess that's how.
Monica, how's it going?
Oh, it's good.
It's good.
Just here, watering the plants.
Don't forget that ficus there by Rachel.
Chandler's on the couch!
I see him.
You guys are the worst hiders, ever.
-Hi.
-How you doing?
The other day when you said you needed to talk.
.
.
.
.
.
just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
It's good news.
It's definitely good news.
Hold on a second, I have another call.
How's it going?
It's still me.
I've got picture-in-picture here.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.
Monica?
You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
So I'll see you soon.
-Okay.
I love you.
-I love you.
We love you too!
Well, it's good news.
It's good news.
-What do you think the good news is?
-Look at this!
He wrote a check for $50,000 to "Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.
" Sorry.
What do you think the good news is?
Oh, my!
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!
You gotta get Mom on the phone!
Call Mom!
Call Mom!
And that's Pete's mom.
You have to make it a theme wedding.
And the theme could be: "Look How Much Money We've Got!
" I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
You could have, like, little-money place settings.
And you could start with a money salad.
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
Would you stop?
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.
But this is Pete.
He's not like other people.
On your first date, you went to Rome.
For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.
Monica's right.
We're talking about marriage here.
She can't just rush into this.
What do you know?
You married a lesbian!
I gotta go.
I have to break up with vince.
So you're going with the teacher?
I like vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive.
In the long run, I think sensitive is better than having.
.
.
.
.
.
a really, really, really nice body.
Jason.
Definitely Jason.
-Wish me luck!
-Good luck!
Oh, my God!
Sorry.
I was imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
Excuse me.
Is vince here?
Oh, sure.
I didn't know you guys actually used those.
So what's up?
This isn't gonna be easy.
I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Good deal.
I'm sorry.
No, it's okay.
It's just that I thought we had something pretty special here.
I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.
There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.
My God!
I didn't know you were so-- I'm sorry.
I can't talk.
I'm gonna go write in my journal.
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
If you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.
Thanks.
But I wanna remove it, not make it savory.
When girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body.
.
.
.
.
.
they tell their friends about it.
Give me that.
Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
Bride's Magazines?
I know you said you'd say no if he asked you.
.
.
.
.
.
but how great would you look walking down the aisle.
.
.
.
.
.
in this Donna Karan?
You so would!
You should get that anyway.
Well, for clubbing.
It is so weird.
I know what I said.
But this morning.
.
.
.
.
.
I was lying in bed, imagining what it'd be like to say yes.
I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed.
.
.
.
.
.
and it's not like me to do something like this.
But it doesn't mean I can't.
Right?
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.
And I know that we want the same things.
And when I thought about saying yes.
.
.
.
.
.
it made me really happy.
Oh, my God!
I know.
I need more pie.
Mon, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
You didn't break up with that fireman?
That was my way of telling you.
Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.
He keeps a journal and he paints.
He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
He'd prefer watercolors, but he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
So will you dump Jason?
Yeah, because I have to break up with someone.
So Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is vince.
Plus, vince has the body.
You know?
So.
.
.
.
It's really just about the math.
Come on in.
You sounded serious on the phone.
Is anything wrong?
You must be Ross.
I am Guru Saj.
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so.
.
.
.
Well, relax.
If it makes you feel any better, I've attended.
.
.
.
.
.
fine medical schools in Central America.
Well, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
Come on, have a seat.
As I suspected, it's a kundus.
What's a "kundus"?
I don't know.
What's a kundus with you?
Please lie down.
I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
I guess it's worth a try.
Sure.
We should see results-- Clearly not the way to go!
What?
What?
We appear to have angered it.
We?
We angered it?
I think I see the problem.
And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
Love.
Oh, God!
There is absolutely no way this is gonna come off.
.
.
.
.
.
unless you start to.
.
.
.
What was that?
Well, it's gone.
How's that?
Got caught in my watch.
Lights.
Romantic lights.
Nice.
So there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.
Oh, right.
I'd completely forgot about that.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
And I look at my life.
.
.
.
.
.
and I feel like I've conquered the business world.
And I feel like I've conquered the intellectual world.
And now I have the most beautiful woman in the world.
But there's one thing missing.
What's that?
It's time for me to conquer the physical world.
I wanna become.
.
.
.
.
.
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
You wanna what?
I wanna be the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
It's the most intense physical competition in the world.
It's banned in 49 states.
What are you talking about?
My trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me.
.
.
.
.
.
Jeet Kune Do and Brazilian streetfighting.
I even had my own octagon training ring designed.
And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
I want you there, in the front row, when I win.
I want you close enough to smell the blood.
What do you think?
My parents will be so happy.
Crazy underwear Creeping up my butt Crazy underwear Always in a rut Crazy underwear What is he doing here?
All right, just keep playing.
You'll get through this.
You'll be fine.
Okay, thank you.
And as always, no one talk to me after the show.
I was passing by and saw you were playing.
This is cool, seeing you up there.
What's going on here?
Who's this guy?
I don't know!
He just started kissing me.
Get him, vince!
What?
I've been dating both of you.
And it's been really horrible, because it's been.
.
.
.
.
.
a lot of fun for me.
But I like you both.
.
.
.
.
.
and I didn't know how to choose.
So I'm sorry.
I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person.
Relax.
It's okay.
I mean.
.
.
.
We never said this was exclusive.
Neither did we.
So give yourself a break.
Really?
We haven't been going out that long.
Come on, we haven't even slept together yet.
You haven't?
You have?
Well, this is none of my business.
I can't believe this!
You slept with him?
Well, I made you a candlelight dinner in the park.
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
That could've been really awkward.
You made him a candlelight dinner in the park?
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.
I can't believe I went out with somebody.
.
.
.
.
.
who'd have an open flame in the middle of a wooded area!
Everything's gonna be all right.
Okay, Dick?
Hello.
I am Guru Saj.
He's a duck, right?
Because otherwise.
.
.
.
.
.
this is way out of my league.
He's got a really bad cough, and our vet can't stop it.
Is there something you can do?
Let me see.
Let me see.
Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
Do you think there's a town in Missouri or someplace.
.
.
.
.
.
called Sample?
And as you' re driving into the town, there's a sign and it says: "You' re in Sample.
" -How did it go with Pete?
-Tell us.
You' re not gonna believe this.
So I go-- I' m sorry.
Excuse us.
-It's a little crowded.
Do you mind?
-Could you skooch?
Move over just a little bit.
Keep on skooching.
So, guys, listen.
I go over there and, you know, I' m-- Why?
What is wrong with me?
-What's the matter?
-Tim.
.
.
.
.
.
I have a feeling.
.
.
.
.
.
my wife is sleeping with her gynecologist.
How do you know?
-He's got access.
-I know.
It's a feeling you get.
Like when you' re in somebody else's bowling shoes?
That's the one.
-So you went to Pete's.
-What happened?
Why is this happening to me?
Maybe it's my wound.
Forget it.
It's not healed yet?
It's oozing!
Would you pass the cream?
There's the cream.
Thank you very much.
Tomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me.
-What is it?
-I've been sleeping with your wife.
You' re the gynecologist?
I' m trying to have a private conversation.
Can I have a napkin?
Could you please hand me a napkin?
Just give me the thing, all right?
Enough!
And you are no longer my friend!
We are finished!
Nada!
No more!
You are a bastard for doing that!
Stay away from me!
Come back!
So what were you gonna tell us?
I have no idea.
The One With the Ultimate Fighting Champion GELULA & CO.
, INC.
What was the big news Pete wanted to tell you?
Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?
Oh, keep your name.
Don't take his name.
He didn't ask me to marry him.
Then definitely don't take his name!
He wanted to tell me he's going to compete in some Ultimate.
.
.
.
.
.
Fighting Competition thingy.
-Pete?
-Why?
What is it?
I don't know exactly.
It's sort of like wrestling.
But without the costumes.
And it's not fake.
It's totally brutal.
It's two guys in the ring and the rules are, "There are no rules" !
You can bite and pull people's hair and stuff?
Anything goes except eye-gouging and fish-hooking.
-What's fish-hooking?
-What's fish-hook-- Thanks.
That would have been hard to describe.
What is that taste?
My hands are totally clean.
I just gave the duck a bath.
Thanks for the warm welcome.
It's good to have you guys on my team.
I come to play.
I hope you do too.
Let's go out there and get them!
And remember: There is no "I" in "team.
" Yes, but there's two in "martini.
" So, everybody, back to my office.
You!
Chuckles.
What's your name?
It's Bing, sir.
I' m sorry.
I was just.
.
.
.
No, no.
I heard what you said.
Funny.
I like funny.
This team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.
Good to have you aboard, Bing!
That's right.
Ryder.
Winona Ryder for six.
Thank you.
Yeah.
We have the reservations.
All right, buddy!
Way to go!
Dude, what are you doing?
Thank you.
My boss keeps slapping my butt, and acting like it's no big deal.
What'd you do about it?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't want to be the guy.
.
.
.
.
.
who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
I gotta tell you, I think it's okay to be that guy.
Maybe it's that jock thing.
You know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
You know, I don't understand guys.
I mean, I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew.
.
.
.
.
.
by, you know, grabbing her boob.
I know.
For a really great stew, you'd just.
.
.
.
.
.
stick your head in between them.
Can we please go eat?
-Yeah, what are we getting?
-Anything but stew.
So from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.
Don't turn your back to him.
Or you could teach him a lesson, you know?
What you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?
Then, when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.
Now, what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
What if Joey was President?
Can I ask you something?
Okay, you can totally say no.
.
.
.
.
.
but would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
With who?
My friend Bonnie.
She always thought Ross was cute.
.
.
.
.
.
and she asked if I could set it up.
-But if that's not cool.
.
.
.
-Which one is Bonnie?
You remember her from my birthday party?
Average height.
.
.
.
.
.medium build, bald.
.
.
.
That's fine.
Great!
Okay!
Good for you!
All right!
You are iron!
You are steel!
Let me ask you, how come when I call your computer support line.
.
.
.
.
.
I have to wait an hour and a half?
We' re adding operators all the time.
Could we concentrate on my training?
It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get.
Hi, honey.
On the table.
On the table, please.
So listen, my friends were telling me a little bit about.
.
.
.
.
.
this Ultimate Fighting thing.
It sounds really dangerous.
I don't want you to get hurt because I kind of like you.
I don't want to get hurt either.
I' m being smart about this.
See these guys?
They' re the best trainers in the world.
And Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.
A house painter!
He used to be a house painter!
-Promise me you'll be careful.
-I promise.
Are we still on for tonight?
Good.
Because.
.
.
.
.
.
maybe we could have a little workout of our own.
No boom-boom before big fight!
How about just a boom?
That was depressing.
I just bought a pretzel.
.
.
.
.
.
from one of the kids from Fame.
Ready to go to the movies?
Oh, this is Bonnie!
This is Bonnie?
This is Bonnie?
You' re Bonnie?
I can show you an l.D. if you want.
Oh, no.
You look a lot different than the last time I saw you.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.
Have fun tonight.
Thanks.
You too.
You said she was bald.
She was bald.
She's not now.
How could you not tell me she has hair?
I don't know.
I hardly ever say that about people.
Oh, well this is just perfect!
Well, I' m sorry.
I thought you said it was okay.
I said it was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick.
That girl has got hair all over her head!
-Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
-Does she have a bad personality?
Oh, no, Bonnie's the best!
Bing!
Read your CompuTek proposal.
Real home run.
Barely got you that time.
Get over here!
Come on.
Oh, yeah!
Good one.
That was a good one.
Keep at it, team!
-What is with him?
-"With him"?
You' re his favorite.
You' re his guy!
We never get smacked.
That's not true.
He smacked you once.
Not on purpose.
He ricocheted off you and got me.
I' m telling you, I need some smacks.
I got a kid starting Dartmouth.
Dartmouth?
Who went to Dartmouth?
Dartmouth sucks!
-You go to Dartmouth?
-No, sir.
There you go!
God, Ross!
What is that?
The Ultimate Fighting Combo.
I saved 30 cents.
Plus, I get to keep the cup.
From New York City, New York.
.
.
.
.
.
appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut.
.
.
.
.
.
he's known for his confrontational business style!
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing.
.
.
.
.
.
Pete Becker!
I love you, Pete!
And his opponent, from Huntington Beach, California.
.
.
.
.
.
he's a 300-pound streetfighter.
.
.
.
.
.
Tank Abbott!
Pete?
Pete?
-That guy's pretty huge.
-Don't worry.
I'll use his strength and weight against him.
Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
You go get him.
Let's go!
Here we go, gentlemen.
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Then let's get it on!
It's me.
Monica.
Can I just tell you how proud I am of you?
It would be nice after hearing I thought you were nuts at first.
.
.
.
.
.
but you did it.
Now you can just look back at this with no regrets.
Look back?
You' re not gonna keep going?
Let me ask you a question: Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no.
But-- I' m not gonna stop until I' m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out.
Let me tell you a story.
When I set out to create MOSS 865, do you think it happened overnight?
No.
There was MOSS 1 that burned down my dad's garage.
There was MOSS 2 that would only schedule appointments in January.
And 862 others that I learned from.
Just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn't know that already?
Look, I' m gonna get better.
Okay?
I promise you.
Just get a lot better.
Fast.
One other thing.
Hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
That was the problem.
-How long until Pete's fight?
-About five minutes.
They' re interviewing his opponent.
Apparently, he trains by going to lran and pulling the arms off thieves.
-Hot dog?
-Four, please.
I' m really nervous.
Thank you.
So how did it go with Bonnie?
Oh, I gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting to like her at all.
I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.
But she's really terrific.
It's too bad.
No, I' m saying I liked her.
There are other fish in the sea.
I think she's great, okay?
We' re going out again.
I hear you.
Are you capable of talking about anything else?
Which one's my turkey burger?
The one next to my foot.
Sorry.
-Fight's starting!
-We'll be right in.
So did your boss try to slap you again today?
Nine times.
I had to put on lotion.
But it'll be okay.
Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.
And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.
Fight's over!
Excuse me, Doug?
Hey there, sports fan!
Bing!
You got those numbers for me?
No.
I didn't do them.
You forgot?
No, I just didn't do them.
Instead, I hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.
So I certainly don't deserve praise.
verbal.
.
.
.
.
.
or otherwise.
I got tanked myself last night.
Pretty dicey drive home.
Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller.
That's okay.
You' re still my number-one guy!
Bing!
Doug!
I' m a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.
Is it the swearing?
ls it the constant swearing?
Because I gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!
It's not about the swearing.
It's more about.
.
.
.
.
.
the way that you occasionally.
.
.
.
.
.
concentrate your enthusiasm.
.
.
.
.
.
on my buttocks.
Don't get me wrong.
I appreciate the sentiment.
It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.
And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
Well, say no more.
You know, it takes guts to bring this up.
Bing, you' re okay.
Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant.
.
.
.
.
.
or inside his shower drain?
Oh, my God.
Look.
It's Ross and that girl.
Look at that!
It's a line of ants!
They' re working as a team!
Right.
Oh, yeah.
It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
I hope he lets her down easy.
Look at that!
They are not breaking up!
Look at them!
You know what that is?
A second date, that's what that is.
Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.
That's nothing.
She's very sexually aggressive.
Oh, God!
It's your fault.
Now he loves her.
He'll marry her.
It's all your fault.
You said it was okay.
You said she was bald!
Was!
Was, was, was!
We can't let it happen.
We have to do something.
We have to break them up.
Just go in there and shave her head!
You owe me one bald girl!
Okay, first of all, breathe.
Second of all, I don't get it.
Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?
Well, isn't he your friend?
Don't you want him to be happy?
So?
It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.
-Oh, no.
-What?
We killed them all!
It's not as bad as it looks.
It's a precaution.
I' m not supposed to move my spine.
Please tell me you' re stopping now.
I' m fine.
I'd fight tonight if they'd let me.
Now, see this circle I' m marking off here?
This is my Zone of Terror.
You are insane!
You've got to give this up!
I can't until I' m the Ultimate Fighter.
I will do it.
The day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight.
.
.
.
.
.me or Superman.
Not that I could beat Superman, but kids are stupid.
Just sit down.
Please listen to me.
You are terrible at this, okay?
You are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.
Ever!
I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm.
.
.
.
.
.
and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.
Well, then, you know what?
I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.
So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.
If you' re asking me to quit.
.
.
.
.
.
then you' re asking me to be someone I' m not.
I've got to do this.
Then I've gotta go.
Bye.
Could you leave a note?
I' m on painkillers.
.
.
.
.
.
and I might not remember this tomorrow.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I' m happy.
Great job, team!
Tomorrow at 8:30.
Phil, nice job!
Stevens, way to go!
Goldberg, you maniac!
I love you!
-Couldn't have done it without you.
-Thank you, sir.
Oh, excuse me.
I forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.
Of course, you did.
Forgot something else too, you bastard!
Well, what about you?
You' re not feeling left out, are you?
No, not at all.
That's ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too.
Don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, get on out of here, you!
Pete Becker circles the ring.
Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.
Bruiser is charging!
Run, you crazy, rich freak!
I can't watch this.
Check it out!
Pete's winning!
Really?
Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!
Wait!
lf that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?
This is ironic.
Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.
And from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
So your first sexual experience was with a woman?
I was 1 5.
It was my best friend, Ruth.
And we got drunk on that hard cider.
And then suddenly, we were making out.
Tell it again.
Seriously.
Can that woman talk about anything else but sex?
Yeah, sure.
Earlier she was talking about geography.
She was listing the countries she's done it in.
I think we all learned something.
Hey, you guys!
Look what I found!
That's my mom's writing.
Look.
"Me and Frank and Phoebe, graduation, 1 965.
" -Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?
That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.
According to her yearbook, they were BFF.
Best Friends Forever.
That's great!
I know!
She probably has all kinds of stories about my parents.
She might know where my dad is.
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.
Maybe this weekend we can go there.
-Shoot, I can't go.
I have to work.
-That's too bad.
Big fat bummer.
So tomorrow we'll drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
The One At the Beach GELULA & CO.
, INC.
Would you look at them?
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.
I'm gonna die an old maid.
You're not gonna die an old maid.
Maybe an old spinster cook.
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse.
.
.
.
.
.
I'll be your boyfriend.
Yeah, right.
Why is that so funny?
You made a joke, right?
So I laughed.
A little too hard.
Am I not boyfriend material?
You're Chandler.
You know.
Chandler!
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.
But say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.
I show up at your door and I'm, like, "Hey, nice to meet you.
" I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Oh, good.
You bought food.
No, just my luggage.
I am having the best karma this week.
I find this woman who knew my parents.
.
.
.
.
.
and then my client gives me his beach house.
What about that bike messenger you hit?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Hey, check out the hat!
Wait a minute, I know that hat.
I was taken aboard that hat.
They did experiments on me.
I can't have children!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Ross gave it to me.
I think she looks good.
Did he buy it for you.
.
.
.
.
.
or win it for you?
Excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm here to tell you hats are back.
And this time, they've ganged up and formed one giant super-hat.
Go, go, go!
Now everybody wants to be under the hat!
What's with all this sand?
Bob said there might be flood damage.
Either that or he has a really big cat.
It's kind of an unusual house.
It has three beautiful bedrooms and no baths.
But, you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hang on.
Come in, come in.
Think about it and call me back.
Are you Phoebe Abbott?
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!
You're lrwin's daughter?
I mean your old best friend.
Here.
-Lily?
From high school?
Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily.
Yes.
Of course I remember Lily.
Then you must be-- Phoebe, Phoebe.
She named me after you, I guess.
Wow.
Well.
Look, there's Frank!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes, yes!
That's my dad.
That's Frank!
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.
Or sangria!
I could make sangria!
Sorry.
Cookies are good, thanks.
Anyway, I've been looking for my father.
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I lost track of everybody after high school.
Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything.
Oh, well, you know, we were always together.
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?
The Three Losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
I heard what happened.
That must have been just terrible for you.
.
.
.
.
.
Iosing your mother that way.
Yeah, no, it was great.
You know what a really good rainy-day game is?
I mean, naked game.
We should play strip poker.
Are you crazy?
Come on.
When you go away, you have to play.
It's, like, a law.
-All done.
-Thank you.
Okay.
Who's next?
No way!
Come on, please.
I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.
Well, if that's the rule this weekend.
.
.
.
-Get away.
-Take it like a man.
Come on!
Big bullies!
How are we doing?
Bored and bored.
You know what naked card game's never boring?
So what's Phoebe like?
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?
I think she knows where my dad is!
Cool!
Where is he?
She was pretending she hasn't heard from him.
.
.
.
.
.
but I found this picture.
Isn't this what he would look like now?
Totally familiar.
Why would she lie to you?
We're having dinner tomorrow.
Maybe she'll tell me then.
Maybe she just wanted to give him time.
.
.
.
.
.
to buy me presents.
I don't know.
So you're all bored?
I'll close my eyes and point to someone.
Whoever it is.
.
.
.
.
.
has to think of something fun to do.
And we have to do it.
Okay!
Fan out!
Fan out!
You know, we could just do this!
We all have to play strip poker?
Strip Happy Days Game?
I couldn't find cards, so it was this or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.
Done.
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points.
" Get five points, you get to make someone take off one item of clothing.
It hasn't happened yet, but we're very excited.
Okay, come on.
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up to lnspiration Point.
Collect three cool points.
" Yeah!
Which gives me five.
And let's see, who is gonna lose their clothes?
I think I pick our strip poker sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.
All right, relax.
It's just a shoe.
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points.
" Which means I have five and that means I get Joey's boxers.
Fine.
Gang up on me.
I got you all, right where I want you.
Come on!
Take them off!
Actually, it's kind of cold.
What if I keep them on and give you a peek at the good stuff?
I'm gonna make more margaritas.
What are you doing?
Trying to get me drunk?
I'm just making margaritas.
Think I'll help her out.
What is going on here?
What?
You're painting his toenails.
Chasing him around the room.
Monica, please.
He's totally flirting with you too.
He is, isn't he?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just being here at the beach together.
.
.
.
.
.
but it's like something-- Hi, Bonnie.
My boss let me off early, so I took the train.
What are you guys doing?
We're playing Strip Happy Days Game.
Cool!
I'll catch up!
So you still don't think.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm boyfriend material?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
You didn't even take off your pants.
Lucky for you.
-What?
-I don't know.
Well, is everybody else having just the best time?
Joey's asleep.
He passed out.
We put sand around him to keep him warm.
Well, I assume the happy couple isn't up yet?
Did you guys hear them last night?
I don't know what they were doing, but sea turtles came up to the house.
Good morning.
-How'd you sleep?
-Great.
Like a log.
Us too.
I'm going for a walk.
Good morning.
Nice breasts by the way.
Hey, what happened to you?
Oh, nothing.
I just felt like hanging out and reading.
The water was so great.
We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.
Sorry I missed that.
Joey and Chandler sure are funny.
I brought back half the beach in my hair.
It was easier when I shaved my head.
You know, I gotta tell you.
.
.
.
.
.
I just loved your look when you were bald.
Really?
I think about shaving it again sometimes.
Really?
You definitely should do that.
You know what?
I should do it!
You know what?
Thank you.
You are so cool.
Oh, stop.
Go on.
-Now go shave that head.
-All right.
What's the matter?
She canceled.
My namesake canceled on me.
She claims she had to go out of town.
She's avoiding me.
She doesn't want to tell me where my father is.
She knows!
Pheebs, that sucks.
Well, don't "Pheebs, that sucks" me yet.
-Where are you going?
-She's out of town.
Something in her house will tell me where he is.
Some people call that "breaking and entering.
" Well, are any of those people here?
Look, I'll do something nice, okay?
I'll fill her ice trays.
Good?
Hey, everybody!
Look what you did!
You wanna touch it?
No, but it's great.
Come on, touch it.
You can feel all the bones in your skull.
I was having a little chat with Bonnie, and guess what?
She brought up who was behind the head-shaving idea.
And now, who was it?
Oh, that's right.
It was you!
That was her idea.
I just gave her a nudge.
She said you gave her the razor.
So anyone up for a midnight dip?
-No, I'm good.
-No, thanks.
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
-Okay, have fun.
Come on, see?
She doesn't look that bad.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head!
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
You balded my girlfriend!
All right.
Do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
You're the one who ended it!
Because I was mad at you!
Not because I stopped loving you!
You still love me?
You still love me.
Yeah, so?
You love me.
What does this mean?
I mean, do you want to get back together?
No!
Maybe!
I don't know.
I still can't forgive you for what you did.
But sometimes when I'm with you, I just feel so.
.
.
.
What?
I just feel.
.
.
.
-I just-- -What?
I feel-- No!
I don't care!
I'm not playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!
But I made cards!
Good night.
I'm going upstairs.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Wanna play strip poker for practice?
My ass!
Oh, it's me!
It's me!
-I didn't wanna make any noise!
-Then don't break in!
-I'm sorry!
-What are you doing here?
I came to fill your ice cube tray.
What?
Okay, look.
I took this picture from your fridge.
I know that this is my father.
This is Frank Buffay, and you were standing next to him!
I deserve to know where I came from.
So if you can help me find my father, then you should.
Otherwise, you're just mean.
So just tell me the truth.
All right.
The man in that picture is Chuck Mangione.
My father is Chuck Mangione?
That's just Chuck Mangione.
I sold him a house last year.
And I'm very sorry, but I really don't know where your father is.
And that's the truth.
But you're right.
I think a person should know where they come from.
Which is why l. .
.
.
I'm your mother.
I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just.
.
.
.
.
.
felt all floopy, and.
.
.
.
You guys are getting back together.
She doesn't even know what she wants.
Rachel's still mad at me.
Then you gotta back away.
You don't need that kind of hurt.
Take it from a guy who's.
.
.
.
.
.
never had a long-term relationship.
I know, but I really want to go up there and finish that kiss.
The water is great.
You should go in.
No, thanks.
I just had an M&M.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Don't be too long.
Okey-dokey.
There is not one hair on that head.
It'll grow back, right?
And she's really fun, and she's cool.
And I'm finally moving on.
Getting over Rachel was so-- I'm finally feeling sane.
And if I go up there.
.
.
.
.
.
and I kiss her.
.
.
.
God, I want to kiss her!
And it doesn't work out.
Do I wanna put myself through that again?
Let me get this straight.
If you go with Bonnie, you do the smart, healthy thing and move on.
Right?
And if you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
Hi there.
That's that weird voice again.
Let me try it again.
You'll wanna date this next guy, I swear!
Hi, I'm Dorf!
Your date for the evening.
Oh, come on.
Dorf on dating?
That's good stuff!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
So your first sexual experience was with a woman?
I was 1 5.
It was my best friend, Ruth.
And we got drunk on that hard cider.
And then suddenly, we were making out.
Tell it again.
Seriously.
Can that woman talk about anything else but sex?
Yeah, sure.
Earlier she was talking about geography.
She was listing the countries she's done it in.
I think we all learned something.
Hey, you guys!
Look what I found!
That's my mom's writing.
Look.
"Me and Frank and Phoebe, graduation, 1 965.
" -Do you know what that means?
-That you're actually 50?
That's not "me" Phoebe.
That's her pal, Phoebe.
According to her yearbook, they were BFF.
Best Friends Forever.
That's great!
I know!
She probably has all kinds of stories about my parents.
She might know where my dad is.
I looked her up.
She lives by the beach.
Maybe this weekend we can go there.
-Shoot, I can't go.
I have to work.
-That's too bad.
Big fat bummer.
So tomorrow we'll drive out to Montauk.
Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
The One At the Beach .
:staz:.
Would you look at them?
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.
I'm gonna die an old maid.
You're not gonna die an old maid.
Maybe an old spinster cook.
-Thanks.
-Besides, worse comes to worse.
.
.
.
.
.
I'll be your boyfriend.
Yeah, right.
Why is that so funny?
You made a joke, right?
So I laughed.
A little too hard.
Am I not boyfriend material?
You're Chandler.
You know.
Chandler!
Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.
But say we weren't friends.
Say it's a blind date.
I show up at your door and I'm, like, "Hey, nice to meet you.
" I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
Oh, good.
You bought food.
No, just my luggage.
I am having the best karma this week.
I find this woman who knew my parents.
.
.
.
.
.
and then my client gives me his beach house.
What about that bike messenger you hit?
Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
Hey, check out the hat!
Wait a minute, I know that hat.
I was taken aboard that hat.
They did experiments on me.
I can't have children!
Seriously, where did you get the hat?
Ross gave it to me.
I think she looks good.
Did he buy it for you.
.
.
.
.
.
or win it for you?
Excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends.
.
.
.
.
.
I'm here to tell you hats are back.
And this time, they've ganged up and formed one giant super-hat.
Go, go, go!
Now everybody wants to be under the hat!
What's with all this sand?
Bob said there might be flood damage.
Either that or he has a really big cat.
It's kind of an unusual house.
It has three beautiful bedrooms and no baths.
But, you know, the ocean is right there.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hang on.
Come in, come in.
Think about it and call me back.
Are you Phoebe Abbott?
Surprise, Phoebe Abbott!
I'm your best friend's daughter!
You're lrwin's daughter?
I mean your old best friend.
Here.
-Lily?
From high school?
Remember?
-Oh, God, Lily.
Yes.
Of course I remember Lily.
Then you must be-- Phoebe, Phoebe.
She named me after you, I guess.
Wow.
Well.
Look, there's Frank!
Yeah!
Yes!
Yes, yes!
That's my dad.
That's Frank!
I'm sorry I'm getting all flingy.
Take it easy.
If you want, there's cookies.
Or sangria!
I could make sangria!
Sorry.
Cookies are good, thanks.
Anyway, I've been looking for my father.
-Have you heard from him or seen him?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I lost track of everybody after high school.
Well, so tell me everything about my parents.
Everything.
Oh, well, you know, we were always together.
-The other kids had a nickname for us.
-What was it?
The Three Losers.
Oh, poor Lily.
I heard what happened.
That must have been just terrible for you.
.
.
.
.
.
Iosing your mother that way.
Yeah, no, it was great.
You know what a really good rainy-day game is?
I mean, naked game.
We should play strip poker.
Are you crazy?
Come on.
When you go away, you have to play.
It's, like, a law.
-All done.
-Thank you.
Okay.
Who's next?
No way!
Come on, please.
I'm bored.
You let me do it once before.
Well, if that's the rule this weekend.
.
.
.
-Get away.
-Take it like a man.
Come on!
Big bullies!
How are we doing?
Bored and bored.
You know what naked card game's never boring?
So what's Phoebe like?
I'm kind, caring and sweet.
What's Monica like?
No, the other Phoebe.
The one you went to see?
I think she knows where my dad is!
Cool!
Where is he?
She was pretending she hasn't heard from him.
.
.
.
.
.
but I found this picture.
Isn't this what he would look like now?
Totally familiar.
Why would she lie to you?
We're having dinner tomorrow.
Maybe she'll tell me then.
Maybe she just wanted to give him time.
.
.
.
.
.
to buy me presents.
I don't know.
So you're all bored?
I'll close my eyes and point to someone.
Whoever it is.
.
.
.
.
.
has to think of something fun to do.
And we have to do it.
Okay!
Fan out!
Fan out!
You know, we could just do this!
We all have to play strip poker?
Strip Happy Days Game?
I couldn't find cards, so it was this or Strip Bag-Of-Old-Knitting-Stuff.
Done.
"Fonzie gives you two thumbs up.
Collect two cool points.
" Get five points, you get to make someone take off one item of clothing.
It hasn't happened yet, but we're very excited.
Okay, come on.
Daddy needs a new electromagnetic microscope for Prehistoric Forensics.
"Take Pinky Tuscadero up to lnspiration Point.
Collect three cool points.
" Yeah!
Which gives me five.
And let's see, who is gonna lose their clothes?
I think I pick our strip poker sponsor, Mr. Joey Tribbiani.
All right, relax.
It's just a shoe.
"Your band is playing at Arnold's.
Collect three cool points.
" Which means I have five and that means I get Joey's boxers.
Fine.
Gang up on me.
I got you all, right where I want you.
