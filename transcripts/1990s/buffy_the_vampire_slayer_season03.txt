{START OF EPISODE 1}
That's right, big boy.
Come and get it.
I got him!
Go!
Anytime now!
He's getting away!
And ow.
That really never works.
- Are you guys all right?
|- First of all, what was with the acrobatics?
|How did that happen?
Wasn't Andy Hoelich|on the gymnastics team?
That's right, he was.
Cheater!
OK, and the second problem I'm having - "Come and get it, big boy"?
|- Well, the Slayer always says a pun or a witty play on words, and I think|it throws the vampires off.
It makes 'em frightened|because I'm wise cracking.
OK, I didn't have a chance to work|on that one, but you try it every time.
If I may suggest, "This time it's personal".
I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.
I've always been amazed|with how Buffy fought, but in a way I feel we took|her punning for granted.
Xander, Past Tense Rule.
Oh, sorry, I just meant we in the past|took it for granted and, um we won't when she gets back.
Do you think Buffy knows|school's starting tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Right.
Big day.
Oh, I'm gonna be busy a lot.
But only till three,|and that's when you usually get up.
I can't wait to see Cordelia.
|I can't believe I can't wait to see Cordelia.
I wonder what our first homework|assignment's gonna be.
Hey, you're excited over Cordelia, OK?
We've all got issues.
I guess we should pack it in.
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be great if Buffy just showed up|tomorrow?
Like nothing happened?
- She can't just show up.
She got kicked out.
|- Well, yeah, I know.
I just wish I wish we knew where she was.
- How did you find me here?
|- If I was blind, I would see you.
- Stay with me.
|- For ever.
That's the whole point.
I'll never leave.
Not even if you kill me.
- Anything else?
|- That'll do us, Peaches.
Pay at the counter.
Sure you don't want me to work it off for ya?
- You guys ready?
|- Yeah.
I think we're good.
Um Anne.
- What'll you have?
|- Well, OK What can we get with this?
- Um|- Can we get cake?
Don't be stupid.
We gotta eat healthy.
|We can't have cake.
- Can we get pie?
|- We've got a peach pie.
- I can't guarantee there's a peach in it.
|- We shouldn't have blown all our money.
Come on!
It was worth it.
Hey check this out.
It's nice.
It's nice and, uh permanent.
Yeah.
For ever.
I mean, that's the whole point.
- Hey, do I know you?
|- I don't think so.
- Really?
Where are you from?
|- I'll get your pie.
I'm not feeling great.
|Can you cover for me?
Sure.
OK.
- So, no joy at the cemetery?
|- No, he got away.
We still have some glitches|in the system, like vampires getting away.
|But I think we're improving.
For God's sake, be careful.
I appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire|population down until Buffy returns, but Well, if anything should happen to you and you should be killed,|I'd take it somewhat amiss.
- You'd be cranky?
|- Entirely.
We try not to get killed.
|That's part of our whole mission statement.
- "Don't get killed".
|- Good.
I think you're gonna love that one.
- Hi!
|- Hey, Willow.
- How was your summer?
|- I can't believe you brought that up.
Las Palmas was the nightmare resort.
They order you around|and make you have organised "fun", and I use sarcastic quote marks.
Plus the fact there are cockroaches in Mexico|big enough to own property.
It was all about dread.
|How was your summer?
- Oh, it was OK.
|- Is Xander around?
- Well, uh, yeah.
Somewhere.
|- Good.
Great.
I haven't seen him yet.
- Do I look OK?
|- Oh, yeah!
- How's my hair?
|- It's good!
He didn't meet anybody|over the summer, did he?
No!
Who's he gonna meet in Sunnydale,|but monsters and stuff?
But then again he's always|been attracted to monsters.
- How's my hair?
|- Still good.
- Hi!
|- Maybe he's forgotten me.
Well, I'll just have to make him remember.
See ya!
You came to visit me.
You came with books?
|Are they books for me?
- Well, actually, they're kind of for me.
|- I don't get it.
It's sort of a funny story.
|You remember when I didn't graduate?
Well, you had a lot of incompletes,|but that's what summer school was for.
Yeah.
Well, you remember when I didn't go?
Whoa!
Slow down, people.
|Summer is over.
Be sombre.
But you never said anything.
How am I|supposed to react to this alarming news?
Well, I was pretty much|banking on you finding it cute.
Well, traditionally, you know, repeating|a grade isn't exactly a turn-on.
And you're practically a genius.
|You're Mr Test Scores.
It's all a little weird.
- So the cute thing is out?
|- Have you guys seen Cordelia?
Yeah.
She's around here somewhere.
I don't wanna come on too geeky,|but, uh OK, I'm psyched.
There'll be some heat, if you know what I|mean.
So you might wanna duck and cover.
And I'm starting to be geeky.
OK, bye.
- How's my?
|- Your hair is fine.
Cool.
This is our year, I'm telling you.
Best football|season ever.
I'm so in shape, I'm a rock.
It's all about egg whites.
|If we can focus, keep discipline, and not have quite as many mysterious|deaths, Sunnydale is gonna rule!
I'm trying to get to cute, really.
|But I'm still sorta stuck on strange.
Well, I'd be willing to bargain down|to eccentric, with an option on cool.
- Hey!
|- Hey.
- Good summer?
|- It was all right.
Cool!
Yeah.
- Well, I'll see ya.
|- Yeah.
Whatever.
Hey, how are you?
|Can I talk to you for a minute?
I'm no one.
I'm no one.
I'm no one.
Yes?
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a lead.
A friend in Oakland has a sketchy report of a a young girl fending off a group|of vampires about a week ago.
There's a plane out in about an hour.
And what makes this different|from the last nine leads?
I believe there's a meal on this flight.
I don't mean to poop the party here, it's just, you get your hopes up and then it's|just a big fat raspberry, and I feel bad.
But it's good that you're looking, though.
|You shouldn't give up.
- Oh, yeah.
Definitely.
|- Yes, one must try.
I should go.
You don't think maybe he'll find her?
I think he'll find her|when she wants to be found.
Anne?
Anne?
Buffy?
Don't be mad.
I won't turn you in or nothing.
I guess you don't recognise me.
Lily?
I mean from before.
I was calling myself|Chanterelle then.
I used to Well, I was in this cult|that worshiped vampires.
So lame, I know.
Yeah I, uh, I remember.
You kinda saved us.
I never thanked you or anything.
Did you tell anyone who I was?
Oh, no!
Not even Rickie.
I mean, I was so surprised|to see you here, waiting tables.
But I wouldn't tell.
I know how it is when you gotta get lost.
Do you, uh, do you live nearby?
Well, there's a couple of places.
Uh, they're abandoned,|and a lot of people stay there.
So how come you came up with Anne?
- It's my middle name.
|- Lily's from a song.
Rickie picked it.
|I'm always changing anyway.
Chanterelle was part of my exotic phase.
It's nice.
It's a mushroom.
It is?
That's really embarrassing.
Um, well, it's an exotic mushroom,|if that's any comfort.
Before that, I was following this loser|preacher and calling myself Sister Sunshine.
What do they call you at home?
- I like Lily.
|- It's cool for now.
Hey, do you have any money?
I didn't mean that like Well, I just mean I know this guy.
He's gonna have|this kinda rave thing in his basement.
We could go.
I mean,|I could show you if you had Cos I'm broke.
I don't think so.
I just kinda - I wanna be alone.
|- I didn't mean to bug you.
No, I didn't mean that, it's just|A lot of people like that, it's too much.
I do have the money, though, so you|and Rickie go, and maybe I could No.
It's OK.
Forget about it.
Just That's not very polite.
Are you OK?
I'm no one.
-Are you OK?
|-Jeez, I didn't see you.
- Maybe you shouldn't move.
|- You should lie down.
- Somebody call an ambulance!
|- I'm OK, I just I need to go.
- Where are you running to?
|- Sorry.
Maybe I should ask|where are you running from?
You're pretty new around here.
- You've got the look, though.
|- The look?
Like you had to grow up way too fast.
- What's your name?
|- Anne.
Hey, um I'm Ken.
Here, go ahead, take one of these.
Don't be shy about stopping by.
|You're not starving, but we're not just interested in feeding the body.
|You might find something you're missing.
I'm all right.
Then why are you here?
This is not a good place for a kid to be.
You get old fast here.
The thing that drains the life|out of them is despair.
I mean, kids come here, and they|got nothing to go home to, and this ends up being the last stop|for a lot of them.
Shouldn't have to be that way.
# Ooo-ooo-oooh # On my way to freedom # I ask myself # Why did I come again?
# To find my # Own way to freedom # And the change # Is gonna come - # I'm gonna find my way|- # Find my way # Find my way back to freedom - # I'm gonna find my way|- # Find my way # Find my way # Find my way back to freedom Boy, I'm glad we showed up|for Depressing Night.
- I wonder what she's doing right now.
|- Oh, I know what she's doin'.
Gabbing to friends about her passionate|affair with Pedro the cabana boy, laughing about me, thinking how|she still might have feelings about me.
- Oh, it's possible you're talking about Buffy.
|- It's possible.
The Bronze just never seems|the same without her.
- And the slaying isn't getting any easier.
|- I don't know.
- I think we're getting a rhythm down.
|- We're losing half the vamps.
Yeah, but rhythmically.
We just need to work on our timing, I think.
- I know what we need.
|- A vampire slayer?
Next best thing.
Bait.
- Hello.
|- Hello.
May I?
Of course.
Come on in.
I've just come back from Oakland.
|A friend of mine called with a lead.
Stories about someone fighting vampires.
|It didn't pan out, I'm afraid.
- No Buffy.
|- No vampires.
Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara|listening to extremely silly music.
Well, thank you for going.
I can hardly, uh I can hardly leave the house.
I'm just afraid|she'll call and she'll need my help.
Buffy is the most capable child|I've ever known.
I mean, she may be confused, unhappy,|but I honestly believe she's in no danger.
I just wish I could talk to her.
The last thing we did was fight.
Joyce, you mustn't|blame yourself for her leaving.
I don't.
I blame you.
You've been this huge influence|on her, guiding her.
You had this whole relationship|with her behind my back.
I feel like you've taken her away from me.
I didn't make Buffy who she is.
And who exactly is she?
Buff um, Anne?
Can I talk to you?
- Look, this isn't a good time.
Can it wait?
|- Rickie's gone.
I haven't seen him for more than a day.
|He's never left for that long.
I think something's happened.
|Maybe something's happened.
Did you call the police?
Rickie skipped out on his parole.
|They would just cause more trouble.
I don't know.
Did you ask around?
Can you help me?
I can't.
But that's who you are and stuff, right?
|I mean, you help people, you know I can't get into this.
I'm sorry, Lily.
- You know how to do stuff.
|- I don't.
Not any more.
But I don't know what to do.
We gave blood lots of times|cos you get a few bucks.
- And they have cookies!
|- You're a fan of the sugar rush.
- It's nice.
|- Hi.
Are you donating blood?
- We're looking for a friend.
|- Rickie T?
We come in sometimes.
Rickie, sure.
He's not here.
Do you know if he's been in|in the last day or so?
Let me check the sheet.
This'll probably go faster if we split up.
Can I come with you?
OK, where did I lose you|on the whole splitting-up thing?
Sorry.
I was thinking we could check out|some of your hang-outs and, I guess, meet later at my place.
- OK.
|- Sorry, guys.
- He hasn't been here.
|- Thanks.
- I'll tell him you were looking.
|- Great.
Rickie?
Did you find Rickie?
I thought of He likes to go to this movie|house.
You can get in around the back Lily I think he's dead.
But he takes care of me.
I'm sorry.
We're gonna get a place.
His cousin|can get him a job at the car wash.
Lily, there's there's something else.
The person that I found - was old.
He looked about 8O.
|- Well, that's not Rickie!
I'm sure it was.
I don't know how, but it was like something|drained the life out of him.
- Do you mean like a vampire?
|- No.
A vampire couldn't accelerate|the ageing process.
Maybe it was something in his blood.
When was the last time|You guys gave blood together?
I don't understand.
|Maybe it's not Rickie, OK?
- You're gonna have to deal with this.
|- He didn't do anything wrong!
- Why would this happen to him?
|- That's not the point.
Things happen all the time.
You can't just|close your eyes and hope they'll go away.
Is it cos of you?
What?
You know about monsters and stuff.
You could've brought this with you.
I didn't bring anything with me.
And I didn't|ask you to come to me with your problems.
I just wanted to be left alone.
|If you can't deal, then don't lay it off on me!
Are you OK?
Hey, it's OK.
Maybe I can help.
You can't.
Look, I know you all think I'm a big square|handing out leaflets about hope.
But hope is a real thing, just like despair.
And hope can fill up|a part of you that's missing.
But Rickie is Rickie?
Say, are you Lily?
Right!
He was talking about you.
- You've seen Rickie?
|- Oh, sure!
Rickie's with us now.
She said he was dead.
Well, someone sure handed you a tall tale.
|Rickie's no more dead than I am.
Why don't you come to Family Home?
|We'll get you taken care of.
Candidate for what?
What are you doing?
Breaking into your office and going through|your private files.
Candidate for what?
I'm calling the police.
You've got a bunch of candidates here.
|I wonder if any are missing, like Rickie.
- Gosh, I bet they are.
|- You're getting yourself in a lot of trouble.
I don't want any trouble.
I just wanna be alone and quiet|in a room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cosy.
I don't even know what a tea cosy is,|but I want one.
Instead, I keep getting trouble,|which I am more than willing to share.
- What are you doing with these kids?
|- Nothing.
I just I give him the names of the healthy ones.
Give them to who?
Well, don't you look nice?
I guess.
You don't wanna wear your own outfit|to the cleansing.
It'll get soaked.
A cleansing is like a baptism?
Right?
- Not quite the same.
|-Will I see Rickie after?
Of course.
He's waiting for you.
|He's very excited.
Why do I have to be bait?
I'm always bait.
-Why can't Willow be bait?
|- He's already seen Willow.
And could you complain louder|so that all the vampires leave?
I think this is a good spot.
Is everybody packin'?
Let's do it.
I'm doing this for Buffy's sake.
|This has nothing to do with you.
- Yeah, like I needed that cleared up.
|- Go away.
This is my hiding spot.
- Where do I hide?
|- You don't hide.
You're bait.
- Go act baity.
|- What's the plan?
- The vampire attacks you.
|- Then what?
The vampire kills you.
We watch, we rejoice.
- Everything's a joke with you.
|- No, just our relationship.
- What relationship?
|- Oh, I forgot.
We wanna bury that piece|of the past, don't we?
We come to this station|to wash away the past.
Go ahead.
Kneel.
We let the water run over the sin, and the pain, and the uncertainty.
It looks kinda dirty.
You know, I just I woke up, and I|looked in the mirror, and I thought: hey, what's with all the sin?
I need to change.
I'm I'm dirty.
I'm bad with the sex and the envy and that loud music|us kids listen to nowadays.
Oh, I just suck at undercover.
Where's Ken?
- This is a private moment.
If you could|- How do you make 'em old?
- Do you feed on youth?
What's the deal?
|- Do you really wanna know?
What's going on?
Lily!
Oh, my God!
My face!
Ow!
My face!
Do you have any idea how hard it is to glue that thing on?
!
Guards!
Welcome to my world.
I hope you like it.
You're never leaving.
Let me ask you:|how long did it take you to forget me?
Were you taxiing down the runway,|or in the cab?
Oh, yeah, Mr Faithful!
You probably met up|with some hot little Inca mummy girl.
Yeah!
I heard about her.
Help!
Xander!
Lily?
I always knew I would come here sooner or later.
- I knew I belonged here.
|- Where?
- Hell.
|- This isn't Hell.
Isn't it?
What is Hell but the total absence of hope?
The substance, the tactile proof of despair.
You're right, Lily.
This is where you've|been heading all your life.
Just like Rickie.
- Rickie?
|- He forgot you.
Well, it took him a long time.
He remembered your name|years after he'd forgotten his own.
- But, in the end|- Years?
But Oh!
Interesting thing: time moves more quickly here|than in your reality.
A hundred long years will pass here.
|On Earth, it's just a day.
So you just work us till we're too old|and spit us back out.
That's the plan.
You see, Lily, you'll die of old age before|anyone wonders where you went.
Not that anyone will.
|That's why we chose you.
- You didn't choose me.
|- No.
But I know you, Anne.
So afraid.
So pathetically determined to run away|from whatever it is you used to be.
To disappear.
Congratulations.
You got your wish.
You work and you live.
That is all.
You do not complain or laugh|or do anything besides work.
Whatever you thought,|whatever you were, does not matter.
You are no one now.
You mean nothing.
- Who are you?
|- Aaron.
Who are you?
No one.
- Who are you?
|- No one.
Who are you?
I'm Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.
|And you are?
Anyone who's not having|fun here, follow me.
There's no way we can get back up there|without meeting new people.
OK.
Lily, when those guards leave,|and they will leave, I want you to take these people|and get them up there, OK?
- Fast and quiet.
|- You're leaving me?
But Lily You can handle this.
Cos I say so.
We've gone public.
|OK, get them out.
Go!
Quiet!
- I'm sorry I said this was your fault.
|- Lily, this can wait.
- Well, in case we die|- Go!
After her!
Come on, come on, everybody go!
Run!
Humans don't fight back.
Humans don't fight back!
That's how this works!
Get down there!
One of you fights and you all die!
That was not permitted.
Yeah, but it was fun.
You've got guts.
I think I'd like to|slice you open and play with them.
Let everyone know!
This is the price of rebellion!
They'll be coming.
OK, this works the abs and the glutes.
I'm gonna feel this for a week!
You've ruined - You|- Hey, Ken, Wanna see my impression of Gandhi?
- Gandhi?
|- Well, you know, if he was really pissed off.
What do we do about?
Let me give you the tour.
This concludes our tour.
It's really nice.
All the rent's paid up for the next three weeks.
I spoke to Mitch at the diner.
He said you can start on Thursday.
He's, uh he's kind of repulsive, but, uh|he won't give you a hard time.
I'll call and check up on you.
I'm not great at taking care of myself.
Gets easier.
Takes practice.
Hey Can I be Anne?
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Mom, I'm a vampire slayer.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", You walk out of this house,|don't even think about coming back.
These are the moments you want|to savour.
You're expelled.
- I love you.
|- I love you.
Buffy.
Wouldn't it be great if Buffy showed up|tomorrow?
Like nothing happened?
- She can't just show up.
She got kicked out.
|- I wonder what she's doing right now.
Joyce, you mustn't|blame yourself for her leaving.
I don't.
I blame you.
- Mom?
|- Buffy.
- Sorry.
|- No, no.
Don't worry about it.
I guess I just got used|to all the quiet while you were gone.
But it's no problem.
Look.
It's Nigerian.
We got a very exciting|shipment in at the galley.
I thought I'd hang a few pieces in here.
|It cheers up the room.
It's angry at the room, Mom.
|It wants the room to suffer.
You have no appreciation of primitive art.
You going out?
Well, if it's OK.
- I'd like to find Willow and Xander.
|- Will you be slaying?
Only if they give me lip.
Can I make you a sandwich before you go?
|You must be starving.
I was until that four-course snack|you served me after dinner.
Well, then You know, why don't I drive you?
- You know, I mean, they could be anywhere.
|- Mom - If you don't want me to go,just say so.
|- No, no.
I just wanna put this whole thing|behind us, get back to normal.
You go.
Have a good time.
OK.
Didn't anyone warn you|about playing with pointy sticks?
It's all fun and games|until somebody loses an eye.
You shouldn't sneak up on people like that.
Jeez, Buff.
- Nighthawk!
Everything OK?
|- Nighthawk?
Hey, Buffy.
Hey, guys.
You know, maybe it's too late.
|Maybe we should just come back tomorrow.
What if he's mad?
Mad?
Because you ran away and abandoned|your post, your friends and your mom and made him lay awake|every night worrying about ya?
Maybe we should wait out here.
Check it out.
The Watcher's|back on the clock.
Just when you were thinking career change,|maybe becoming a looker or a seer.
Thank you, Xander.
Welcome home, Buffy.
I got in a few hours ago,|but I wanted to go see my mom first.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
How did you find her?
Well, I pretty much remembered the address.
I mean How are things between you?
Excuse me.
So you're not wanted for murder any more.
Good.
That was such a drag.
- Where were you?
Did you go to Belgium?
|- Why would I go to Belgium?
I think the relevant question|is why wouldn't ya?
Belgium.
- What's up with you, Xander?
|- You know, same old, same old.
- Hardly.
|- OK, I lied.
A whole lot is new.
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
New is good.
|- Absolutely.
Except for the obvious.
Yeah, cos you weren't in hell.
Cordelia went on a luxury vacation.
- I feel for you.
|- Here we are then.
Chow's up.
So were you, like, living in a box, or what?
Well, it's a long story.
So skip the heart-warming stuff about|kindly old people and get right to the dirt.
Perhaps Buffy could use a little time to adjust|before we grill her on her summer activities.
- What he said.
|- Fair enough.
Leave the slaying to us while you settle in.
|We got you covered.
I noticed.
You guys seem down with the|slayage.
With your walkies and everything.
Yeah, but the outfits suck.
|This whole Rambo thing is so over.
I'm thinking more sporty, like Hilfiger maybe.
Still, we were getting good.
|We dusted nine out of ten.
- Six out of ten.
|- Six out of ten.
Whatever, we were kicking undead booty.
Thank you for the offer, but I think|I wanna get back to my normal routine.
You know, school, slaying.
Kids' stuff.
In fact, I'm jonesing for a little brainless fun.
|What are you doing tomorrow?
I would, but I'm kinda tied up.
You wish.
- Will?
|- Tomorrow, I Come on.
Friends don't let|friends browse alone.
OK.
I had some schoolwork,|but I can change my plans.
As for school, Buffy, you know you'll have|to talk to Principal Snyder before On it.
Mom is making|an appointment with His Ugliness.
I know she can break him.
Absolutely not.
Under no circumstances.
But you can't keep her out of school.
|You don't have the right.
I have not only the right, but also|a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her|out of school.
I'd say I'm tingly.
Buffy was cleared of all those charges.
Yes.
And while she may live up to the|not-a-murderer requirement for enrolment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school|property and the occasional student.
And her grade-point average is enough to I'm sorry.
Another tingle moment.
How can you be so cavalier|about a young girl's entire future?
I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents|and abilities of Buffy will land on her feet.
In fact, I noticed as I came in this morning that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring.
You will look so cute in that hat.
Let's go, Mom.
This isn't over.
If I have to,|I'll go all the way to the Mayor.
Wouldn't that be interesting?
Don't worry about school, honey.
If we can't get you back into Sunnydale,|maybe we can swing private school.
Private school?
|You mean, like, jackets and kilts?
- You want me to get field-hockey knees?
|- It's not that bad.
What about home schooling?
It's not just|for scary religious people any more.
We'll work something out.
OK?
Say hi to Willow?
My word.
You must be Buffy.
Look at you.
Aren't you a picture?
- Thank you.
|- I'm Pat.
From your mom's book club.
- I'm sure she mentioned me.
|- Actually I sort of took it upon myself|to look after her while you were, you know, off and away|or what have you, and Well, between your situation and reading|Deep End of the Ocean, she was she was just a wreck.
You can imagine.
Anyway, I'm off.
We're making|empanadas in my Spanish class tonight.
You go be with your mom.
|You two need to rebond.
Pat wishes us quality time.
- I met her in a|- Book club.
- Got it.
|- Before I forget, Willow just called.
- Where was she?
|- She got held up.
But she said she tried to call.
- Was there a message?
|- No.
But I had a thought.
What if I invited Willow and Mr Giles and|everybody over for dinner tomorrow night?
Don't you think that would be nice?
Since I sort of already did,|I was hoping for ayes.
- That'll be fun.
|- Great.
Do me a favour?
|Run down and get the company plates.
Mom Willow and everybody|aren't company-plate people.
- They're normal-plate people.
|- We never have guests for dinner.
Indulge your mother?
Next time, I get to pick|the mother-daughter bonding activity.
- Do you wanna say something?
|- Like what?
Thanks for stopping by and dying?
How about: goodbye, stray cat|who lost its way.
We hope you find it.
- I thought they'd be here.
|- They are.
They're waiting for you.
Am I dreaming?
I'm probably the wrong person to ask.
You'd better go.
I'm afraid.
You should be.
I've been on the phone with|the superintendent of schools.
At least he seems more reasonable than that|nasty little, horrid, bigoted rodent-man.
Mom.
Anyway, I'm going in|to speak with him this afternoon.
As for private schools,|Miss Porter's accepts late admissions.
- I wrote the information down for you.
|- A girls' school?
So now it's jackets, kilts and no boys?
|Care to throw in a little foot-binding?
Buffy, you made some bad choices.
You just|might have to live with some consequences.
Nothing's settled yet.
I just wish you didn't have to be so secretive.
It's not your fault you have a special|circumstance.
They should make allowances.
Mom, I'm a slayer.
It's not like|I need to ride a little bus to school.
Couldn't you just tell a few people, like|Principal Snyder and maybe the police?
I mean, I would think they would be|happy to have a superhero.
Is that the right term?
|It's not offensive, is it?
Welcome to the Hellmouth Petting Zoo.
My God, what a stench.
You know, I wanted Forest Pine|or April Fresh, but Mom wanted Dead Cat.
Well I'll get it back to the library,|see if we can determine its exact origin.
It's striking and Nigerian.
Yes.
I have this wonderful dealer|who specialises in ancient artefacts I love art talk as much as the next very dull|person, but we have work to do, Giles.
- Research mode.
|- Shouldn't you stay with your mother?
- You must have|- Please, no.
It's fine.
She can go with you.
Actually, she can't.
You're not allowed on school property.
I'm sorry.
I'll call as soon as I know something.
- We'll see you tonight.
|- Tonight, then.
It looks dead.
It smells dead.
Yet it's movin' around.
That's interesting.
Nice pet, Giles.
|Don't you like anything regular?
Golf, USA today, or anything?
I'm tying to find out how and why it rose|from the grave.
I'm not about to take it home.
Well, I like it.
I think|you should call it Patches.
What about Buffy's dinner tonight?
|I told her mom we'd help out.
Bring stuff.
I'm the dip.
You gotta admire the purity of it.
What?
Onion dip.
Stirring, not cooking.
It's what I bring.
We should figure out what kinda deal this is.
|I mean, is it a gathering, a shindig, - or a hootenanny?
|- What's the difference?
Well, a gathering is brie,|mellow song stylings, shindig, dip, less mellow song stylings,|perhaps a large amount of malt beverage, and hootenanny, well, it's chock-full|of hoot, just a little bit of nanny.
- Well, I hate brie.
|- I know.
It smells like Giles's cat.
- It's not my|- And what'll we talk about at a gathering?
"Did you meet any nice pimps|on your travels"?
and "Thanks for ruining our lives|for the past three months".
- Xander.
|- You know what I mean.
She doesn't wanna talk about it, we don't,|so why don't we just shut up and dance?
Well, Buffy said she did wanna loosen up,|you know, have some kid time.
Aren't you rehearsing tonight?
|Why not play at the party?
- I think I could supply some Dingo action.
|- I'm not sure that a - shindig|- Hootenanny.
Hootenanny is really the order of the day.
Maybe something a little more intimate.
|Buffy has just got home.
I'm sure she's still feeling a little disoriented.
All the more reason to make her feel|welcome.
A big party says "Welcome, Buffy".
OK, so one vote from the old guy|for a smelly cheese night and how many votes for actual fun?
All right, all right.
Have it your way.
I'm just glad to have her home.
Now things can get back to normal.
There you are.
Not thinking about|any more flights of fancy, I hope.
Joyce said there was room for one more,|so I said forget facial night and let's party.
I bet you like empanadas.
Do you wanna see my mom?
Mom!
Pat.
Good.
- Buffy, I hope you don't mind.
|- Hi.
Great.
Hey, Buffy.
Where do you want|the band to set up?
The band?
- Hey.
|- Hey.
- This is large.
|- You like?
Yeah.
It's great.
I was just sort of hoping it would be us.
Sorry.
What?
This is amazing but I was sort of hoping|we could just hang together - the gang.
Is everything OK?
You you seem to be avoiding me,|in the one-on-one sense.
What?
This isn't avoiding.
|See?
Here you are, here I am.
- So we're cool?
|- Way.
That's why, with the party,|cos we're all glad you're back.
- OK.
|- OK.
Good.
Hey, Buff.
What are you doing?
I was just taking a break|from all this wacky fun.
Some kind of party, huh?
I guess a lot|of people are glad to have you back.
It seems like people|I didn't even know missed me.
- Did Giles say he was gonna be late?
|- He was Library Man last time I saw him.
He'll be here.
He wants to celebrate|your homecoming.
We all do.
It's great to have the Buffster back.
- Isn't it?
|- Totally.
Except you were kinda turning me on|with that whole Boy Slayer look.
- Was I now?
|- You bet, Nighthawk.
Well, I'll just be Yeah.
Breathe.
Breathe.
All right, look, these burns are too extensive.
|It's 1:43.
Let's call it.
Oh, my God!
- What's the deal with this party anyway?
|- This party?
Heard it was for some chick|that just got outta rehab.
Now, how are you holding up, Joyce?
Really.
Really?
I'm I don't know.
While Buffy was gone,|all I could think about was getting her home.
I just knew that if I could put my arms around|her and tell her I loved her, it would be OK.
- But?
|- Having Buffy home, I thought it was gonna make it all better|but, in some ways, it's almost worse.
Oh, Lord.
Party Villa, can I rock you?
I need to speak with Buffy.
Immediately.
I|have information that is extremely important.
Yeah.
Fiesta foul.
You gotta do a shot.
I need to speak to Buffy.
Now!
Bunny?
- That guy's gotta do a shot.
|- Buffy!
Hey.
I need to talk to a Buddy.
Is there a Buddy here?
Sorry.
He's not here.
|You got the wrong house, Mr Belvedere.
Hello?
Hello.
You're leaving again?
You just stopped by for your lint brush|and now you're ready to go?
- It's not like anyone'll mind.
|- No.
Have a great time.
- And don't forget to not write.
|- Why are you attacking me?
- I'm tying.
|- And it looks so much like giving up.
- I'm just trying to make things easier.
|- For who?
- You guys were doing fine without me.
|- We were doing the best we could.
It's not like we had a lot of choice.
Sorry that I had to leave, but you|don't know what I was going through.
- Well, I'd like to.
|- You wouldn't understand.
Well, maybe I don't need to understand.
Maybe I just need you to talk to me.
How could I when you were avoiding me?
This isn't easy, Buffy.
I know you're going through stuff,|but so am I. - I know you were worried about me but|- No.
I don't just mean that.
I mean, my life.
You know?
I'm having all sorts of I'm dating.
I am having|serious dating with a werewolf, and I'm studying witchcraft|and killing vampires, and I didn't have anyone to talk to about all this scary life stuff.
And you were my best friend.
Unbelievable.
"Do you like my mask"?
"Isn't it pretty?
It raises the dead".
Americans.
Jesus!
My God.
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?
God.
You have no idea how much I missed you.
Everyone.
- I wanted to call every day.
|- That doesn't matter, Buffy.
- It doesn't make it OK that you didn't.
|- What is this?
Is this some sort of a joke?
- Mom, please, could you just|- No, I can't just.
- Buffy, what is this?
|- She was running away again.
No, I wasn't.
- I'm not sure.
|- You better get sure and explain yourself.
If you think you can take off|anytime you feel li Stop it.
Please.
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Don't you leave this house, young lady.
|You know what?
That's it.
- You and I are gonna have a talk.
|- Mom, please You know what?
I don't care.
|I don't care what your friends think, or you, for that matter, because you|put me through the wringer.
I mean it.
And I've had schnapps.
|Do you have any idea what it's been like?
- Mom, this isn't the t|- You can't imagine months of not knowing.
Not knowing whether you're lying dead|in a ditch somewhere or living it up.
But you told me.
|You're the one who said I should go.
You said if I leave, don't come back.
|You found out who I really was and you couldn't deal.
Remember?
Buffy, you didn't give me time.
You dumped it on me|and expected me to get it.
Well, guess what?
Mom's not perfect,|OK?
I handled it badly.
But that doesn't give you the right|to punish me by running away.
- I didn't do this to punish you.
|- Well, you did.
- You didn't see what you put her through.
|- Great.
Thanks.
Anybody else wanna weigh in here?
|How about you by the dip?
No, thanks.
I'm good.
Maybe you don't wanna hear it, Buffy, but|taking off was incredibly selfish and stupid.
OK.
I screwed up.
I know this.
|But you have no idea!
You have no idea what happened|to me or what I was feeling.
- Did you even try talking to anybody?
|- There was nothing anybody could do.
OK?
- I just had to deal with this on my own.
|- Yeah, see how well that one worked out.
You can't just buy stuff.
|It'll come back up to get ya.
Good show, Giles.
Like riding a bloody bicycle.
As if I could've gone to you.
Your feelings|about Angel and I were perfectly clear.
Look.
I'm sorry that your honey was a demon, but most girls don't hop|a Greyhound over boy troubles.
Time out, Xander.
Put yourself|in Buffy's shoes for just a minute.
OK?
I'm Buffy, freak of nature, right?
|Naturally I pick a freak for a boyfriend, and then he turns into|Mr Killing Spree, which is - Cordy.
Get outta my shoes.
|- I'm just trying to help, Buffy.
- Buffy, you never|- Willow, please.
- I can't take this from you, too.
|- Let her finish.
You at least owe her that.
God, Xander.
Could you at least stick|to annoying me on your own behalf?
Fine.
You stop acting like an idiot,|I'll stop annoying you.
You wanna talk acting|like an idiot?
Nighthawk?
OK.
I'm gonna step in now.
|Being Referee Guy.
No, let 'em go, Oz.
|Talking about it isn't helping.
We might as well try some violence.
I was being sarcastic.
- Xander, kitchen.
|- Got your back.
- Are these vampires?
|- I don't think so.
Buffy, heads up!
No, not vampires.
Man, this sucker wobbles,|but he won't fall down.
- We gotta get 'em back outside.
|- On three.
One two three.
OK.
We're gonna have to barricade this door.
|We need some help out here!
I got him.
Go help Buffy.
Pat!
Careful.
Hurry.
Go!
She's Oh, God!
Pat!
She's dead.
- What do we do if they get in?
|- I kind of think we die.
I don't hear anything.
Should we check?
Let's go for it.
- Here.
|- Thanks.
- It's me.
|- How do we know you're not Zombie Giles?
- Cordelia, do stop being tiresome.
|- It's him.
I think the Dead Man's Party's|moved upstairs.
That makes sense.
It's the mask|in Joyce's bedroom they're after.
Mask?
The mask holds the power of|a zombie demon, called Ovu Moboni.
Evil Eye.
- I don't think we can get past them.
|- Well, what happens if they get the mask?
If one of them puts it on,|they become the demon incarnate.
Worse than a zombie.
Yes, worse.
Oh, God!
We thought you were Generally speaking, when scary things|get scared, not good.
I live.
You die.
Willow, don't look.
Out back!
Not looking.
Not looking!
Tell Buffy, Moboni's power lies in his eyes.
She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!
Buffy!
Hey, Pat!
Made you look.
Never mind.
Honey!
- Are you all right?
|- Yeah.
So, is this a typical day at the office?
No.
This was nothing.
Nice moves.
You, too.
- Do we have an appointment?
|- I'd like to have a word with you.
If that word is Buffy, then I have|two words for you: "good" and "riddance".
Now, if you don't mind,|I have an appointment with the Mayor.
- You can't keep her out of this school.
|- I think you'll find I can.
- You had no grounds for expelling her.
|- I have grounds, precedent and a tingly kind of feeling.
Buffy Summers is a minor,|and is entitled to a public education.
Your personal dislike of the girl|does not legally entitle you to Why don't you take it up|with the city council?
I thought I'd start with|the state supreme court.
You're powerful in local circles, but I believe I can make life very difficult|for you, professionally speaking.
And Buffy will be allowed back in.
Sorry.
I'm not convinced.
Would you like me to convince you?
I mean, I'm not a full-fledged witch.
|That takes years.
I just did a couple of pagan blessings and|a teeny glamour to hide a zit.
- Does it scare you?
|- It has.
I tried to communicate with the spirit world,|and I so wasn't ready for that.
It's like being pulled apart inside.
Plus I blew the power|for our whole block.
Big scare.
- I wish I could've been there with you.
|- Me, too.
I really freaked out.
- I am sorry.
|- It's OK.
I understand you having to bail.
|I can forgive that.
I have to make allowances for what you're|going through and be a grown-up about it.
You're really enjoying this moral|superiority thing, aren't you?
- It's like a drug.
|- Fine.
OK.
I'm the bad.
I can take my lumps for a while.
All right.
I'll stop giving you a hard time.
- Runaway.
|- Will.
I'm sorry.
Quitter.
- Whiner.
|- Bailer.
- Harpy.
|- Delinquent.
- Tramp.
|- Bad seed.
- Witch.
|- Freak.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- I'm giddy.
|- I like you giddy.
Always have.
It's the freedom.
As seniors|we can go off campus now for lunch.
It's no longer cutting, it's legal.
|It's expected.
It's also a big step forward.
|A senior moment, one to be savoured.
You can't just rush into this.
No, I can't!
- You can.
|- You are.
But what if they changed the rule?
|What if they're lying in wait to arrest me and throw me in detention|and mar my unblemished record?
Breathe.
OK This is good.
This is Hey, we're seniors.
|Hey, I'm walkin' here.
Ah, Buffy and food.
We shouldn't be couply around Buffy.
Cos the only guy that ever liked her|had to be put down like a dog?
Can she cram complex issues|into a nutshell, or what?
All right, prepare to uncouple.
Uncouple.
Buffy, banned from campus, but not our|hearts.
How are you, and what's for lunch?
- I just threw a few things together.
|- Now you're Martha Stewart?
First, she knows jack|about hand-cut prosciutto.
- I don't believe she slays, either.
|- I hear she can, but doesn't like to.
Second, way too much free time|since I got kicked out of school.
I know they'll let you back in.
- Aren't you and your mom meeting Snyder?
|- We see Snyde-man tomorrow.
Scott Hope at 11 o'clock.
He likes you.
He wanted to ask you out last year,|but you weren't ready.
But I think you're ready now.
Or at least in the state of pre-readiness|to make conversation.
Or do that thing with|your mouth that boys like.
Oh, not the bad thing with your mouth,|I meant that half-smile thing you - You're s'posed to stop me when I do that.
|- I like when you do that.
- Hi, Buffy.
|- Hi.
I think that went very well, don't you?
He didn't try to slit our throats.
It's progress.
- Did you do that half-smile thing?
|- Look, I'm not trying to snare Scott Hope.
I just wanna get my life back,|do normal stuff.
Like date?
- Well|- You wanna date.
I saw that half-smile, you little slut.
All right, yes, date, and shop,|and hang out, and go to school, and save the world from unspeakable|demons.
You know, girlie stuff.
Welcome to Happy Burger,|May I take your order?
Diet soda.
Medium.
that'll be 89 cents at the window, sir, Sunnydale.
Town's got quaint.
And the people.
He called me "sir".
|Don't you just miss that?
Admittedly it's not a haven for the brothers,|strictly the Caucasian persuasion, but you just gotta stand up|and salute their death rate.
I ran a statistical analysis,|and hello, darkness!
Makes DC look like Mayberry.
And ain't nobody sayin' boo about it.
We could fit right in here.
Have us some fun.
We're here for one thing.
Kill the Slayer, yeah.
|Still, big picture - Have a nice night, sir.
|- Right back at ya.
The Slayer.
I'm going to rip|her spine from her body, and I'm going to eat her heart|and suck the marrow from her bones.
Now I'm hungry.
I miss you.
I had to.
I loved you.
- Oh, God, Angel|- Go to hell!
I did.
Morning, sunshine.
Ready to face the beast?
Here are the terms of your re-entry, missy.
|Take 'em or leave 'em.
One, that you pass a make-up test of|every class you skipped out on last year.
Two, that you provide, in writing,|one glowing letter of recommendation from any member of our faculty|who is not an English librarian.
Three, that you complete an interview|with our school psychologist who must conclude|that your violent tendencies are under control.
I'm not sure I like your attitude, Mr Snyder.
|I spoke with the school board, and I'm required to educate every juvenile|who's not in jail where she belongs.
Welcome back.
So let me get this straight.
I'm really back in school because|the school board overruled you.
Wow.
That's like having your whole ability|to do this job called into question.
I think what my daughter's trying to say is: It's the mayor on line one, It's so great that you're a schoolgirl again.
Giles say what he wanted?
|You think he's mad?
I don't think so.
|I think he just needed to see you.
Have you noticed, though, when he is mad|but he's too English to say anything he makes that weird cluck-cluck sound|with his tongue?
Hi, Giles.
Oh, hi.
Been there long?
Buffy, good timing.
I could use your help.
|I trust you remember the demon Acathla?
Giles, contain yourself.
|Yes, I'm back in school, but you know it embarrasses me|when you gush so.
Let's just skip that and get to work.
Of course it's wonderful to have you back.
|That goes without saying.
But you enjoy making me say it, don't you?
OK, Acathla, huh?
What are you doin'?
|Making him demon pizza?
We need to make sure|he remains dormant, and that the dimensional vortex is sealed|tight, so I'm working on a binding spell.
Ooh, a spell!
Can I help?
Possibly with the research.
|It's a very sensitive and - Who's more sensitive than me?
|- and difficult spell.
It involves creating|a protective circle around I won't bore you with the details, but there's|a litany one has to recite in Aramaic, and it's very specific,|so I need details about your experience of defeating Acathla and Angel.
- Fire away.
|- I've put the time at about 6:11, about half an hour after Xander rescued me.
Less.
More like ten minutes.
Oh, was the vortex already open?
Barely.
I see.
And Angel?
Big fight, Angel got the|pointy end of the sword, Acathla sucked him into Hell|instead of the world.
That's about it.
Yes, well, that should be very helpful.
Oh, no.
I have to go take|an English make-up exam.
They give you credit|just for speaking it, right?
Mm, sage.
I love that smell.
And Marnox root.
You know, a smidge of this|mixed with a virgin's saliva It does something I know nothing about.
These forces are not to be played around|with, Willow.
What have you been conjuring?
Nothing much.
Well, you know,|I tried the spell to cure Angel, and I guess that was a bust.
But since then, you know, small stuff.
Floating feather, fire out of ice -|which next time I won't do on the bedspread.
Are you mad at me?
No, of course not.
If I were, I would be making a strange|clucking sound with my tongue.
Don't let me interrupt.
Are you Is she all glowy?
Yeah, I suspect happiness.
I passed my English make-up exam,|I'm hanging with my friends Hello, my life, how I've missed you.
Hi, Scott!
What are you doin' here?
You told me if I came after eight|I could run into Buffy.
I'm sorry, I'm a bad liar.
|It's not good for the soul.
Or the skin, actually, it makes me blotch.
Hi, Scott.
- Don't you love this song?
|- Yeah, actually, I do.
Would you like to?
Dance?
Um I don't know.
I'm bad with - Thank you for asking, it's just that|- OK, I'll just stand by the dance floor.
If you change your mind, you can mosey|on over.
If not, then you don't mosey.
No harm, no foul, right?
Right.
Come on, Buffy.
|I mean, the guy is charm.
And normal, which is what|you wanted to get back to.
Plus bonus points|for use of the word "mosey".
I just don't think I'm ready.
What's stopping you?
Check out Slut-o-rama and her Disco Dave!
What was the last thing that guy danced to?
|KC and the Sunshine Band?
I don't think that guy thrives on sunshine.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh No, I have to Oh.
Uh, sorry.
My bad.
No, it's mine.
Really, it's mine.
|But I I have to go.
Where'd she go?
I bet it's nothing.
|They're probably just making out.
That's not what making out sounds like.
|Unless I'm doing it wrong.
Stop struggling.
This won't hurt.
It's OK, I got it.
You're Buffy, right?
I'm Faith.
I'm gonna go out on a limb|and say there's a new slayer in town.
Can I borrow that?
Thanks, B. Couldn't have done it without you.
The whole summer it was, like,|the worst heat wave.
So it's about 118 degrees|and I'm sleepin' without a stitch on.
All of a sudden I hear screaming outside,|so I tear out, stark nude, and a church bus is broke down,|and there's three vamps feasting on half the Baptists|in South Boston.
So I waste the vamps, and the preacher's|huggin' me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden the cops pull up,|and they arrested us both.
Wow, they should film that story|and show it every Christmas.
God, I could eat a horse!
Isn't it crazy how|slayin' always makes you hungry and horny?
Well, sometimes I crave|a non-fat yoghurt afterwards.
I get it!
Not the horny thing - yuck -|but the two-slayer thing.
There was one,|then Buffy died for two minutes, so then Kendra was called,|and when she died Faith was called.
But why were you called here?
I wasn't.
My watcher went off to some|retreat thing in England, so I skipped out.
I figured this was my chance to meet|the infamous Buff and compare notes.
So, B, did you really use|a rocket launcher one time?
Yeah.
Actually, it's a funny story So what was that alligator story?
|You said something before?
There's this big daddy vampire out|in Missouri who used to keep 'em as pets.
So he's got me rasslin' one of 'em -|it must've been 12ft long So, was this also naked?
Well, the alligator was.
Xander?
Find a new theme.
I tell ya, I never had more trouble|than that damn vamp.
So what about you?
|What was your toughest kill?
Well, they're all difficult, I guess.
Oh, do you guys remember the Three?
Right, you never met the Three.
|Well, there was Something occurring.
You both kill vamps,|and who could blame you, but I'm wondering about|your position on werewolves.
- Oz is a werewolf.
|- It's a long story.
- I got bit.
|- Apparently not that long.
Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at me|or humpin' my leg, we're five by five, y'know?
Fair enough.
The vamps, though,|better get their asses to DEFCON 1.
Cos you and I are gonna have fun,|watcherless and fancy-free.
- Watcherless?
|- Didn't yours go to England, too?
There is a watchers' retreat every year|in the Cotswolds.
It's a lovely spot.
It's very serene.
There's horse riding and hiking and punting,|and lectures and discussions It's a great honour to be invited.
Or so I'm told.
Ah, it's boring.
|Way too stuffy for a guy like you.
Maybe I should introduce you again.
|Faith, this is Giles.
If I'd known they came that young and cute,|I'd have requested a transfer.
Raise your hand if "eww".
Well, leaving aside for a moment|my youth and beauty, I'd say it was fortuitous|that Faith arrived when she did.
Sorry.
I just meant There's a big evil brewin'.
You'll never be bored here, Faith, cos this|is Sunnydale, home of the big brewin' evil.
I don't know how big and evil it is, but two people have disappeared|from the Sunset Ridge district.
Well, I'm good for patrolling.
Latish, though.
|I promised Mom I'd be home for dinner.
To which you're invited, of course.
|Dinner with us.
Dyin' to meet the fam.
I'm in.
Great.
Then we can patrol.
|Also together.
- Don't you have a health science make-up?
|- Oh, yeah.
I could use some coaching.
You can hang out with us while|she's testing.
You wanna?
Say yes, and bring your stories.
You guys go.
It's fine.
Fine.
I'll just sit.
OK.
Hey, later.
We will talk weapons.
This new girl seems to have a lot of zest.
I've been having a little problem|with the binding spell for Acathla.
I'm lacking the requisite details|to perform it correctly.
Now physical location|Acathla was facing south?
Acathla, Angel, me, sword.
That's what I thought, but Giles, look, I've got make-up tests to pass,|missing people in Sunset Ridge, and a zesty new slayer to feed.
|Next time I kill Angel, I'll video it.
And over here we have the cafeteria,|where we were mauled by snakes.
And this is the spot where|Angel tried to kill Willow.
And over there is where Spike and his gang|nearly massacred us on parent-teacher night.
And up those stairs|I was sucked into a muddy grave.
They say kids don't learn anything in school|nowadays, but I've learned to be afraid.
You guys are a hoot and a half.
If I'd had|friends like you in high school, I'd probably still have dropped out, but|I might've been sad about it, you know?
So what's up with B?
I mean, she seems wound kinda tight,|needs to find the fun a little, like you two.
- Well|- Oh.
Water.
And then the alligator story.
She's got something, doesn't she?
What is it with you and slayers?
Maybe I should dress up as one|and put a stake to your throat.
Oh, please, God, don't let that be sarcasm.
I'm gonna tell him straight.
- Oh, excuse me.
|- Sorry.
I know you from somewhere.
- The Bronze.
Friend of Buffy's, right?
|- Yeah.
I'm Faith.
- I'm Scott.
Nice to meet you.
|- Nice to meet you.
Well, I'm two for two with make-up tests.
|Proud, yes, but also humble, and We're looking at what?
Does anyone believe|that is her actual hair colour?
I haven't seen him laugh like that.
|Hey, maybe Faith and Scott could hit it off.
I mean, if you're done with him|Not that you used him Well, I hadn't definitely 100 per cent|said no for all time.
It's just, you know, you don't|enter into these things lightly.
There's repercussions to consider, and Why am I seeing a look?
You really do need to find the fun, B. Buffy.
- Hey.
|- Hey, Buffy.
Faith has been telling me tall tales.
She's funny.
And she's leaving.
|We have to go.
He's a cutie.
Is he seeing anybody?
Mr Trick, talk to me.
This town this very street,|wired for fibre optics.
See, we jack in a T-3, 2500 megs per,|we have the whole world at our fingertips.
All I'm sayin' is we stay local, where the|humans are jumpin' and the cotton is high, but we live global.
You get the hankerin' for|the blood of a 15-year-old Filipina, I'm on the net and she's here|the next day, express air.
I want the blood of the Slayer.
On that note, there's good news and bad.
Rumour has it that this town already|has a slayer, which makes two.
I'm not sure how that happened.
I don't care if there are a hundred slayers!
|I'll kill them all!
She's going to pay for what she did to me.
Yes, she is.
I'm running a computer check on every hotel,|rooming house and youth hostel in town.
Meanwhile, as soon as the sun goes down, we're out in force.
Food's here, boys.
You guys order So you're a slayer, too.
|Isn't that interesting.
- Do you like it?
|- God, I love it.
- Mom?
|- Just a second, honey.
You know, Buffy never talks that way.
|Why do you love it?
Well, when I'm fighting it's like the whole|world goes away and I only know one thing, that I'm gonna win and they're gonna lose.
|I like that feeling.
Sure - it beats that dead feeling you get|when they win and you lose.
- I don't let that kind of negative thinking in.
|- Right.
That could get you hurt.
Buffy can be awfully negative sometimes.
- Honey, you gotta fight that.
|- Workin' on it.
- Faith, can I get you another soft drink?
|- You bet.
She's really cool, huh?
Best mom ever.
Excuse me.
I like this girl, Buffy.
She's very personable.
She gets along|with my friends, my watcher, my mom - Look, now she's getting along with my fries.
|- Now, Buffy Plus at school she was making eyes|at my not-boyfriend.
This is creepy.
Does anybody else think Faith is creepy?
No.
But I'm the one getting|Single White Femaled.
It's probably good you were an only child.
Mom, I'm just getting my life back.
|I'm not looking to go halfsies on it.
Well, some things I'd be happy|to see you share - like the slaying.
I mean, two of you fighting|is safer than one, right?
I guess.
Unless I mean, you heard her, she loves|the slaying.
Couldn't she take over for you?
Mom, no one can take over for me.
But you go to college next year.
|It would be Mom, the only way you get a new slayer|is when the old slayer dies.
Then that means you.
- When did you die?
You never told me.
|- It was just for a few minutes.
Oh, I hate this.
I hate your life.
Mom, I Look, I know you didn't choose this.
|I know it chose you.
I have tried to march|in the slayer pride parade, but I don't want you to die.
I'm not gonna die.
I know how to do my job.
Besides, like you said, I've got help now.
I've got all the help I can stand.
Didn't we do this street already?
Funny thing about vamps - they'll hit a street|even after you've been there.
No manners.
You've been doing this the longest.
- I have.
|- Yeah.
Maybe a little too long.
Excuse me?
What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.
|- You got a problem?
I'm five by five, B, livin' entirely large,|actually wondering about your problem.
Well, I may not sleep in the nude|and rassle alligators Maybe it's time you started, cos something|in your bottle needs uncorking.
What is it, the Angel thing?
What do you know about Angel?
Just what I've heard - big love, big loss,|you oughta deal and move on, but you're not.
I got an idea.
How about from now on|we don't hear from you on Angel or anything else in my life,|which, by the way, is my life.
Why are you gettin' so strung out, B?
Why are your lips still moving, F?
- Did I just hear a threat?
|- Would you like to?
Wow.
Think you can take me?
Yeah.
I just hope they can't.
My dead mother hits harder than that!
Stake him already and give me a hand!
This is for me, you undead bastard!
For Kakistos we live,|for Kakistos you'll die!
Faith!
Faith You can't touch me!
- What is wrong with you?
|- What do you mean?
You "living large" on that vampire.
Gee, if doing violence to vampires upsets|you, you're in the wrong line of work.
- Or maybe you like it a little too much.
|- I was getting the job done.
The job is to slay demons, not beat them to|a bloody pulp while their friends corner me!
I thought you could handle yourself.
You must realise, Buffy, that you and Faith|have very different temperaments.
And mine's the sane one.
The girl's not playing with a full deck.
|She has almost no deck.
She has a three.
You said yourself that she killed one.
She's just a plucky fighter|who got a little carried away.
Which is natural.
|She's focused on the slaying.
- She doesn't have a life here, as you do.
|- She doesn't need a life.
She has mine.
- I think you're being a little|- No, I'm being a lot.
I know that.
She nearly got us both killed.
|The girl needs help.
All right, I'll see if I can reach|her watcher at the retreat.
They're eight hours ahead now.
|They're probably sitting down to a nightcap.
I wonder if they still kayak.
|I used to love a good kayak.
You see, they don't even consider Sorry, I digress.
|The vampire that attacked you, can you furnish me with some details|that might help me trace their lineage?
Ancient or modern dress,|amulets, cultish tattoos?
No tats, crappy dressers, and Oh, the one that nearly bit me|mentioned something about kissing toast.
- He lived for kissing toast.
|- You mean Kakistos?
Maybe it was taquitos,|Maybe he lived for taquitos, What?
Kakistos.
Is that bad?
Kakistos is Greek.
|It means the worst of the worst.
It's also the name of a vampire|so old that his hands and feet are cloven.
Now, this guy shows up|two days ago, right?
Right around the time my bestest|new little sister makes the scene.
You think he and Faith are connected?
Giles, there are two things I don't believe in:|coincidence and leprechauns.
Buffy, it's entirely possible that they both|arrived here by chance simultaneously.
OK, but I was right|about the leprechauns, right?
As far as I know.
Good.
OK, you phone England,|I'll talk to Faith, see if khaki trousers rings - Kakistos.
|- ..
Kakistos rings a bell.
Or an alarm.
- Right.
|- Right.
Hi.
- Scott.
|- How are you?
- OK.
I gotta|- Be somewhere else, right?
Think of this as my last-ditch effort.
|I realise one more will qualify as stalking.
I've given a lot of thought - some might say|too much - to how I might be part of your life.
It begins with conversation, we all know this.
|Maybe over a cup of coffee, or maybe at the Buster Keaton festival|playing on State Street all this weekend.
You know, come to think of it, I don't think|I've given a fair chance to Buster Keaton.
I like what I've seen of him so far.
|I think it might be time to see a little more.
Keaton is key.
Oh, um, I got you a little present.
A guy in|the retro shop said it represents friendship, and that's something|I'd very much like to have with you.
You like?
I can't.
I can't do this.
OK.
I get the message.
Are you all right?
Giles, hi.
Uh, yeah I'm fine.
- Did you reach the retreat?
|- Yes, I did.
What did her watcher say?
Her watcher's dead.
The room's $18 a day.
- That's every day.
|- I'll get it to you by tomorrow, I swear.
It's not like I own the place.
- But I bet you will some day.
|- Not if I listen to broads like you.
- Roommates are extra.
|- I'm just visiting.
So, what brings you to the poor side of town?
Cloven guy.
Goes by the name Kakistos.
- What do you know about Kakistos?
|- That he's here.
We're not happy to see old friends, are we?
|What did he do to you?
It's what I did to him, all right?
And what was that?
Faith, you came here|for a reason.
I can help.
You can mind your own business.
|I'm the one who can handle this.
Yeah.
You're a real bad-ass|when it comes to packing.
What was that you said about my problem?
|Gotta deal and move on?
Well, you have the moving-on part here.
What|about dealing?
You gonna dump that on me?
You don't know me, or what I've been|through.
I'll take care of this, all right?
Like you took care of your watcher?
He killed her, didn't he?
They don't have a word for what he did to her.
- Oh, what now?
|- Faith, you run, he runs after you.
That's where the head start comes in handy.
Faith I just bought us a little more time.
- Oh, no!
|- Scream later!
Escape now!
Let's go!
We're OK.
What happened?
Faith, what happened?
I was there when he killed my watcher, and I saw what he did to her,|what he was gonna do to me.
I tried to stop him, but I|I couldn't.
And I ran.
Faith, first rule of slaying - don't die.
You did the right thing, OK?
You didn't die.
|Now you do the math - one of him, two of us.
Yes.
No.
- This is his place.
|- He drove us here.
Faith!
Don't die!
Don't!
If we don't do something,|the Master could get killed.
Well, our prayers are with him.
There's a reason these vengeance|crusades are out of style.
See, the modern vampire,|we see the big picture.
I guess you need a bigger stake, Slayer!
You hungry?
Starved.
The Council has approved our request.
Faith is to stay here indefinitely, and I'm to look after you both|until a new watcher is assigned.
Good.
She really came through in the end.
She had a lot to deal with,|but she did it.
She got it behind her.
I'm glad to hear it.
Angel was cured.
I'm sorry?
When I killed him, Angel was cured.
Your spell worked at the last minute, Will.
I was about to take him out and, um,|something went through him, and he was Angel again.
He didn't remember anything that he'd done.
He just held me.
But it was it was too late and I had to.
So I told him that I loved him,|then I kissed him, then I killed him.
I don't know if that helps|with your spell or not, Giles.
Yes, I believe it will.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
I've been holding onto that for so long,|it felt good to get it out.
I'll see you guys later.
Giles, I know you don't like me|playing with mystical forces, but I can really help|with this binding spell.
There is no spell.
Scott Hello.
Hey.
I was waiting for you to get out of class.
Oh.
Why?
There was someone a while ago,|and the ring sort of confused me, but I liked what you said about friendship|a lot.
And Buster Keaton, big fun, and I'm capable of big fun, though there's|no way you could know that about me.
Wow, if I knew I was gonna go on this long|I probably would've brought some water.
What I'm trying to say is,|if you'd still like to go to the film festival, and I would understand if you didn't,|I'd pretty much love to go with you.
I don't know, Buffy.
|I'm really gonna have to think about this.
OK, I thought about it and I'm in.
|When do you wanna go?
Well, I have one thing that I have to do|tonight, and then I'm good.
Good.
Goodbye.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
One night, after supper, the lead dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit, the dog lay down low to the race,|his body flashing forward, leap by leap, He was sounding the deeps of his nature, and the parts of his nature that were deeper|than he, going back into the wombs of time.
The rabbit could not OK, maybe we should try|a less stimulating passage.
- Private Harris reporting for Oz watch.
|- Xander.
Oh, good.
Oh!
Call of the Wild, Aren't we reading|the Cliffs Notes to this for English?
Some of us are.
Anyway,|it'll help you stay awake.
It's good and very wolfy.
It seems to soothe the savage beast.
Except for the parts about rabbits.
- Rabbits?
|- It seems to make him a little overexcited.
OK, now he's had his two o'clock feeding, and, after sunrise,|if he forgets where his clothes are, they're on the file cabinet in his cage.
I put those towels up for privacy.
No worries.
|I can handle the Oz full monty.
I mean, not "handle" handle,|like, hands to flesh "handle".
OK, it's not for you.
It's for me, because|I'm still getting used to half a monty.
Oh, good.
Half?
You and Oz?
- Which half?
|- Wouldn't you like to know!
He's more manageable tonight|and on the third night.
Tomorrow night, the full moon,|that's when he's a real woofer.
But in case there's trouble -|there won't be, but if Sleepy time.
Gotcha.
Thanks again for this.
|I wouldn't have asked, but I have this test.
No big.
You can count on me.
|I got my coffee, magazines.
Figured I'd read, maybe run the stairs|over there a little bit.
I'm good.
Bye.
Nice place.
D'you ever catch kids|doin' the dirty out here?
No.
There's a smooch spot up by the woods.
|That's usually where kids go.
Yeah?
Bet you and Scott have been|up there kicking the gearshift.
- Hardly.
We've only been on a few dates.
|- But you like him.
And when you think about him,|you get that good down-low tickle, right?
Yeah, I guess.
- How low?
|- You tell me.
How about not?
But he is nice and he's funny.
And quite a muffin.
Blueberry, that crunchy-munchy stuff on top.
But my most favourite thing so far is that|he doesn't seem to be any kind of hell beast.
All men are beasts, Buffy.
OK.
I was hoping to not get|that cynical till I was at least 40.
It's not cynical, it's realistic.
Every guy from Manimal down to "Mr I Loved|the English Patient" has beast in him.
And I don't care how sensitive they act.
|They're all still just in it for the chase.
I don't think that's true,|that every guy is in it only for the chase.
- I know.
It is an awful generalisation.
|- Hey, Buffy!
That's what I stopped you for, basically.
Hey.
OK.
Hey.
- Howdy, Debbie.
|- Hi, Oz.
You're not doing jazz band this year?
Can't take the pressure.
It's not the music|that's hard, it's the marching.
- We have a marching jazz band?
|- Since the best jazz is improvisational, we'd be going off in all directions,|banging into floats.
It's scary.
- He's just being Oz.
|- Pretty much full time.
- Those are pretty flowers.
|- Pete brought them for me.
Yeah.
I'm sure Scott does|that kind of stuff for you too, Buffy.
Well, we're not up to flowers.
Are we up to flowers?
Did I miss flowers?
No, we're pre-posy.
|Definitely.
What time is it?
- Oh, I have to go see Mr Platt today.
|- Platt, the school counsellor?
To convince him|I'm Little Miss Stable so I can stay.
Platt creeps me out.
I'd quit going, but I'm flunking senior bio|and my teacher says I have "success issues".
Senior bio?
I kinda aced that final.
And how did you do that?
|Oh, right, you showed up.
- If you want my notes, they're yours.
|- That'd be great.
We'd better go.
- I'll see you?
|- Yeah.
We have to recheck|every possible exit avenue.
It's a waste of time.
I was here all night.
Right.
It's good to see you.
No need to panic.
- Just a thought: poker, not your game.
|- What's the deal, Giles?
Now, bear in mind|most likely there is no deal.
But, if there was a deal, then it|would concern murder last night.
- A male student was found in the woods.
|- Which student?
- Jeff Walken.
|- Jeff?
He was - I knew him.
|- I'm afraid he was terribly mauled.
Now, much as I hate to think it,|it could be the handiwork of of - Me.
|- "Wolf' you, not "you" you.
But it's not.
Not "wolf' you, not "you" you.
The room was secured, the gate was locked|and the window unbreakable and open.
Oh, God.
Not to freak.
I rested my eyes|now and then.
That's all.
How long, exactly, did you rest your eyes for?
A little now, a little then.
But I never heard Oz leave and he was|here in the morning when I when I - Woke up!
|- You could put it that way, Mr Technical.
Oh, God.
Two o'clock.
Miss Summers.
Buffy Summers, reporting for sanity.
Look, I know that I have to do this, and|I'll cooperate and I'll look at your ink blots, but I don't want to talk about my life|or my childhood, or anything for that matter.
And I don't want to be friends here.
We're not gonna be friends.
You have friends already.
I hope.
I mean, friends are a good thing.
They like you, agree with you,|tell you what you want to hear.
It's not what you need.
What you need|is a trained, not too crazy professional, who will always give you|his honest opinion.
Which I offer you.
Have a seat.
"Not too crazy".
Those are your credentials?
Look, Buffy, any person|grown-up, shrink, Pope any person who claims to be totally sane|is either lying or not very bright.
I mean, everyone has problems.
Everybody has demons, right?
I gotta say I'm with you on that.
Excellent.
So the hope I bring you is:|demons can be fought, people can change, you can change.
Now, your turn.
Let's start with why you ran away.
That's a long story.
- Bore me.
|- You know, I'm really over it.
I'm moving on, I feel good,|I'm even dating someone new.
All good things.
But still, you're|you're bringing me in at the end of the movie.
I was dating someone.
It ended badly.
My mom and I were fighting and I kinda freaked.
Tell me more about this guy,|the "bad ending" guy.
He was my first I loved him.
- And then he|- Changed?
- Yeah.
|- He got mean?
- Yes.
|- And you didn't stop loving him.
Look, lots of people lose themselves in love.
|It's no shame.
They write songs about it.
The hitch is, you can't stay lost.
And sooner or later|you have to get back to yourself.
And if you can't?
If you can't, well, love becomes your master,|and you're just its dog.
- I'm afraid to ask.
|- Oz ate someone last night.
- He did not.
|- Oz does not eat people.
It's more werewolf play.
I bat you around|a bit, like a cat toy.
I have harmless wolf fun.
Is it Oz's fault that people get cut to ribbons?
|And maybe then he'll take a little nibble and - I'm not helping, am I?
|- No.
- Oz may have got out of his cage last night.
|- Maybe there's another werewolf.
Perhaps.
But perhaps|it's something else entirely.
It's OK.
We'll work together|and we'll figure this out.
Yes, Buffy, you you patrol the woods.
The others, check out the morgue.
Right.
We can see if it's a werewolf kill or not.
But what about Oz?
Well, I have some research materials|at home I need to look at.
We could ask Faith to watch over him.
You're having a slayer watch me?
|Well, good, we're not over reacting.
OK.
You know that things where you bail|in the middle of an upsetting conversation?
I have to do that.
It's kinda dramatic, I know,|but sometimes it's a necessary guy thing.
And I want you to do the guy thing, but Oz?
Get away from the cage.
What?
It's gonna happen soon.
Get away from me.
Oh, God.
Here, hold this.
We're doin' crime.
|Don't sneak up during crime.
God, have a OK.
Scarred for life.
Oh, God.
Willow, how can you stand it?
Yeah, this guy is pretty barf-worthy.
|Can't we be elsewhere?
Like, is Oz cleared or what, huh?
I'm not sure.
There are a lot of incised|wounds, but they could be from anything.
Anything with big sharp teeth and vicious D'you want to go back to the car and wait?
No.
God, I'm just saying Almost done.
Let me just get a few stray|hairs.
They could be from the attacker.
- Great.
So we got everything we need?
|- Yep, that's it.
OK, a little too much excitement|for the Willster here.
- It doesn't look good for Oz, does it?
|- It really doesn't.
This guy was ripped apart|by a big wild animal.
Oh, Buffy.
Are you OK?
|What are you doing here?
Bleeding internally, but I'll live.
God, I'm sorry.
I guess I didn't hear ya.
Figured as much.
Ow, again.
Actually, I came to give you|the rest of the night off.
Get out of jail free, huh?
How come?
I couldn't sleep.
|Figured I'd cram for my French test.
That's cool.
I was going crazy here, but|I can get in a few stakings before sunrise.
Knock yourself out.
Not literally, though.
Yeah.
Later.
Hey.
Hello.
Boy, Faith and her nutty books.
Exploring Demon Dimensions|and Mystery of Acathla, Yeah, and she still listens|to heavy metal.
Ricky-ticky.
Buffy?
What if I told you that I had a dream about Angel, and it brought up some questions?
I'd say it was to be expected.
It must have been some dream.
I didn't think|you knew what a card index was for.
I dreamt that he came back.
Of course.
After Jenny was killed, I had dreams that she was|still alive, that I saved her.
This was vivid.
Really vivid.
Three dimensional,|Sensurround, the hills are alive.
- Do you believe it was a prophecy?
|- No.
I don't know.
I I guess it just it made me wonder.
Is there a chance, even, it could happen?
There's no record of anyone|returning from the demon dimension once the gate was closed.
|I can't imagine how it could happen or why.
Let's just pretend for a second that Angel somehow found his way|back to Sunnydale.
What would he be like?
I really can't say.
From what is known about the dimension,|it would suggest a world of brutal torment, and time moves quite differently there, so I remember.
So he would have been down there|for hundreds of years.
Yes.
Of torture.
It would take someone of extraordinary|will and character to survive that, and retain any semblance of self.
Most likely he'd be a monster.
A lost cause.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
From my experience,|there are two types of monster.
The first can be redeemed, or,|more importantly, wants to be redeemed.
And the second type?
The second is void of humanity.
He cannot respond to reason or love.
- I thought Faith was on duty.
|- Oh, hey.
Change of plans.
Glazed or cake?
|It's fun to watch them make them.
They use this spritzy thing|and drop the batter Couldn't sleep, huh?
I've been to Mister Donut|since the TV did that snowy thing.
How come you're the wakey girl?
This time it's not your boyfriend|who's the cold-blooded Jelly donut?
- Everything all right?
|- Yeah, uh - What happened with the body?
|- Anyone?
They're yummy delicious.
Well, come on.
Was it werewolf?
- Was it a vampire?
|- It wasn't conclusive.
How can it not be conclusive?
|Was he bit?
- Let her finish, Buffy.
|- No, it's just I'm sorry.
Buffy, over here.
- Hey.
|- Hey, uh, I can't I can't back you on that lunch.
|Nutritional demerits.
My stomach doesn't want hard food today.
|But there's fruit in it.
Those are marshmallows.
Oh.
I'm really out of it today.
|I didn't sleep well last night.
Don't tell Mr Platt you have insomnia.
|He'll make you start a dream journal.
Like a Barbie thing?
"How come Ken hasn't|come around since he got that earring"?
I never did it.
He's a quack.
I kinda liked him.
Really?
I guess he's kinda funny and stuff.
It's just, sometimes I just|don't like the things he says.
Oh, he definitely marched to the beat|of his own drummer.
Actually, he makes his own drums.
My mom says that therapy can be helpful.
But your mom has the wattage|of a Zippo lighter.
I hope you realise I don't know these people.
I thought you would like me better|if I had friends, so I hired them.
So I, uh I wanted to tell you|that you look great today.
But now I want to raise that to amazing|because you didn't sleep well.
That's really sweet.
Uh, and I wish I didn't have to,|but I just remembered that I do, so, uh - I'll see you later.
|- Yeah.
Check out Scotty liking|the manic-depressive chick.
Angel?
Do you understand me?
Debbie, come on.
Just for a minute.
- I can't.
I have to meet a friend.
|- So you'll be late, but happy.
- No, no.
Let's stay here.
|- Relax.
What's wrong with you today?
What is that?
- Nothing.
Kiss me.
|- No.
Debbie, you did not drink that, did you?
Drink it?
You know I didn't.
Debbie, what's going on?
Two o'clock, Buffy Summers, right?
Wait.
|Don't turn around.
And don't say anything.
Just listen.
And that's|that's your thing, right?
There's something going on.
This story's probably gonna convince you|that I'm loony-bin material, but there's nobody else that I can talk to.
Not Willow and not Giles.
Nobody.
They if they found out, they'd freak on me,|or they'd do something and I need help.
I just I need to talk to someone.
I'm so scared.
It's this guy.
He He's come back.
So, the bottle just jumped out of|the cabinet and spilled on its own?
Of course not.
I was tying to get rid of it.
- You were trying to get rid of it?
|- To help you.
You know how you get.
You think this has anything|to do with how I get?
- Well, when you drink it|- When I drink it, nothing, Debbie nothing.
I don't need this any more, OK?
|I am way, way past that now.
You see?
You see?
No more.
You could pour out everything I made|and it wouldn't help.
And you wanna know why?
You wanna know why?
Because all it takes now is you, Debbie.
|You and your stupid, grating voice.
You're the reason I started the formulas|in the first place.
To be the man you wanted.
And you pay me back how?
- By whoring around with other guys?
|- No, I don't!
I don't even look!
Is that something your shrink taught you,|Debbie, huh?
Huh?
To share?
To communicate?
To piss me off?
Guess what?
Even he's not going to listen|to your pathetic ramblings any more.
I am all you've got now, Debbie.
Do you hear me?
I am all you've got!
Oh, my God.
Debbie.
Listen.
You know you shouldn't make me mad.
Huh?
You know what happens.
Debbie, please.
Are you all right?
It's OK.
It's OK.
This creature is especially brutal.
The phrase coined by the coroner|when describing Platt was "puréed".
But he confirmed Platt was killed|shortly before Buffy found him.
- Which means he was killed during the day.
|- Yes!
Sorry.
I got I've just been|It's horrible.
Horrible.
It's OK, Will.
We're all glad Oz is off the hook.
Indeed.
Shouldn't he be here by now?
|Sunset's at 5:30.
Sorry I'm late.
Did you bring the notes?
Yeah.
Um..
- You OK?
|- What?
Oh, yeah.
I'm such a klutz.
I Fell down?
Hit your eye?
Doorknob.
I thanks.
If you wanna talk - Thanks again for the notes.
|- Yeah.
Our task now is to determine|what sort of killer.
Clearly we're looking for|a depraved, sadistic animal.
Present.
I may be a cold-blooded donut,|but my timing is impeccable.
But you aren't.
It-it's a killer-in-the-day|monster.
A hundred percent for sure.
- OK.
|- I wish we had time to celebrate properly.
However, we have two victims.
Jeff Walken and now Platt.
Maybe there's something|they had in common.
Missing internal organs.
- Besides that.
|- Debbie.
Well, victim number one, Jeff?
- He was in jazz band.
They horsed around.
|- They were screwing?
I don't think so, but he hid|her music comp book once.
Debbie knew Platt.
She was seeing him, and|way vocal about not having love for the guy.
Add this and stir.
I just saw Debbie|sporting a nasty black eye.
OK, so pretend Debbie wanted Platt dead.
|Maybe he fought back.
No.
Platt was dead in an instant.
He didn't even drop his cigarette.
Now, what if Pete's the one|doling out the punishment?
- We should find them immediately.
|- Debbie was in the quad.
We'll split up.
Faith, you and I team.
|Willow, stick with Buffy.
And I'll go lock myself in the cage.
It's tricky covering a fresh shiner like that.
- You know what works?
|- What?
Don't get hit.
What's going on?
I'll bet the farm you know.
- You're wrong.
I don't know anything.
|- You wanna play "I have a secret"?
Fine.
But people are dying here.
It it's not his fault.
- He's not himself when he gets like this.
|- You mean Pete?
It's me.
I make him crazy.
He just does what|he does because he loves me too much.
Weren't Mr Platt and Jeff|murdered by an animal?
Pete's not like other guys, is he, Debbie?
- I have got to go.
|- You have to talk to us.
- We can't help you until you do.
|- I didn't ask for your help.
When are you going to?
|If Pete kills you, it'll pretty much be too late.
Debbie, we're running out of time.
- Where can we find him?
|- I don't know.
- You're lying.
|- What if I am?
What are you going to do?
Wrong question.
Look at yourself.
|Why are you protecting him?
Anybody who really loved you|couldn't do this to you.
Won't they take him someplace?
Probably.
I could never do that to him.
I miss everything.
Great.
So, while you two live out your|Grimm fairy-tale, two people are dead.
Who's gonna be next?
Since when do you touch my girl?
Pete, this is kind of a bad time.
Well, I guess you didn't think about that|when you put the moves on Debbie.
We talked, yeah.
But it was move-free.
About this cage?
When that sun sets You won't be alive to see it.
I'm serious.
Something's gonna happen|that you probably won't believe.
Or you might.
He does love me.
He does love me.
This is useless.
We have to go.
|I have to find Pete.
He does love me.
He does love me.
- I think we broke her.
|- He does love me.
He does love me.
I think she was broken before this.
Did you kiss that whore?
|Huh?
Did she like it?
Time's up.
Rules change.
What was that?
Get the dart gun!
Hey, watch out!
- Oh, sorry.
|- Oh, right.
Bloody priceless.
- You get the wolf.
|- Got it.
Pete!
You're all right!
God!
You're all right.
She almost shot you.
Did you see?
I stopped her.
You have to leave.
|Get out of Sunnydale.
She knows.
How did she know, Debbie?
|Did you run your big mouth?
No.
She just knew.
|It seemed like she just knew.
- So you filled in the blank.
|- No!
No!
But what did I expect|from a screw-up like you?
I didn't.
Pete?
- You're nothing but a waste of space.
|- No!
Oh, God.
Where's the gun?
Where's the gun?
!
Get off her!
Get the gun!
Get the gun!
Hurry!
All the same!
You're all the same!
Buffy?
Buffy.
It's all over school,|what happened with Debbie and Pete.
Except for the "Pete was a monster" part.
A freshman told me that Pete had|eight café mochas and just lost it.
It's better than the oestrogen theory -|taking his mother's birth-control pills.
He didn't?
Pete was a monster?
|Where have I been?
In your special place,|which is why I adore you.
So what's the true story?
What happened?
We got hold of Pete's lab books and stuff,|and Mr Science was doing a Jekyll-Hyde deal.
He was afraid Debbie would leave him, so|he mixed this potion to become más macho.
After a while, he didn't need the potion to|turn into a bad guy.
He did it fine on his own.
So he wasn't under|the influence of anything?
Just himself.
I'll see you guys later.
Great.
Now I'm gonna be stuck|with serious thoughts all day.
I don't know what to say that's not|gonna sound stupid or obvious.
I've been friends with them both|since before we started school.
Is there anything I can do?
Thanks.
I'm gonna be OK.
It's just that you never really know|what's going on inside somebody.
I mean, you think|if you care about them.
But you never really do.
Night came on, and a full moon|rose high over the trees, lighting the land|till it lay bathed in ghostly day, And the strain of the primitive|remained alive and active, Faithfulness and devotion,|things born of fire and roof, were his; yet he retained his wildness and wiliness, And from the depths of the forest,|a call still sounded,
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
- I think we should get a limo.
|- A limo?
- Yeah.
|- A big, expensive limo?
That sounds fun!
|It is our last Homecoming dance, - so maybe it should be a big deal.
|- You wanna talk fun?
Public bus.
You meet the funnest people.
|Back me up here, Oz.
If it's a dollar issue, we could all take my van.
Van?
The Homecoming Queen doesn't|go to the dance in a van.
Use your head.
You haven't been elected yet.
Although|you certainly and without a doubt will be.
- Who else likes a limo?
|- A private limo.
It is pretty cuddlesome.
And if we all split the cost - Maybe.
You know, if I go and all.
|- Why wouldn't you go?
You already have your tickets.
|I mean, unless you don't have a da..
y or two to think about it.
|We should all think about it.
What's going on here?
Did Scott not ask her|to the Homecoming dance yet?
Thanks, Cordelia.
|Humiliation's really good for my colour.
Well, no.
I just I assumed that you would think it was corny,|but I'm in.
I mean, if you are.
If you want to.
Sure I do.
You know, if you want to.
- Well, I do if you want to.
|- The judges will accept that as a yes.
- Do you want me to get you another drink?
|- No, actually.
I'm a little tired.
|I think I'm gonna call it a night.
- But I'm excited about the dance.
|- Me too.
It's just me.
Here.
How are you feeling?
It hurts less.
Good.
I haven't told Giles|and the others that you're back.
And I'm not going to.
They wouldn't understand|that you're better.
And I'm gonna keep helping you get better.
It's just that everything's different now.
I'm a senior.
|I'm really working harder in school.
I'm even thinking about college.
And I'm involved with someone.
His name is Scott.
He's a nice, solid guy.
He makes me happy.
And that's what I need.
|Someone I can count on.
I don't think we should|see each other any more.
You don't?
When did this happen?
Where was I?
Buffy, it's just Before we were going out, you seemed|so full of life, like a force of nature.
- Now you seem distracted all the time and|- No, I know.
I'm getting better.
Honest.
In fact, from here on, you are gonna see|a drastic distraction reduction.
"Drastic distraction reduction"?
Try saying that ten times fast.
I'm really sorry.
Is that her?
In the nubile flesh, my friend.
That's the target.
The Mayor will see you now.
- I'm sorry to bother you, sir.
|- I'm not bothered, Allan.
Well, I'm not sure how serious this is, but they were spotted in town three days ago,|I've just been informed.
Frederick and Hans Gruenshtahler: wanted in Germany for capital murder,|terrorism, the bombing of flight 1402.
I should have brought it to your attention|sooner, but I wanted to confirm Would you show me your hands, please?
- Sir?
|- Your hands.
- I think they could be cleaner.
|- Of course, sir.
I mean, I washed them, but After every meal, and under your fingernails.
|Dirt gets trapped there.
And mayonnaise.
My dear mother said "cleanliness|is next to godliness" and I believed her.
She never caught a cold.
I'd like these two to be|put under surveillance.
I'd like to know if any other|colourful characters have come to town.
- I'll take care of it.
|- You have all my faith.
You have to help me pick an outfit.
I wanna|wear something that makes Oz go "Oh".
No problem.
I got the tux goin' on.
|I'm gonna look hot if it even remotely fits.
Whatcha doin'?
Checking out the - I laughingly|use the phrase - "competition".
Holly Charleston: nice girl,|brain-dead, doesn't have a prayer.
Michelle Blake: open to all mankind, especially those|with a letterman's jacket and a car.
- She could give me a run.
|- Where's Buffy?
She'll miss the pictures.
With Faith in the library, gettin' all sweaty.
- They're training.
|- I stand by my phrase.
She wasn't here the day they announced 'em.
|Anybody tell her?
I'll do it.
I'm going to|the nurse's office for an ice pack.
- Did you hurt yourself?
|- No, silly.
It shrinks the pores!
Man!
Guys should break up|with you more often.
Gee, thank you.
I mean it.
You got some quality rage goin'.
|Really gives you an edge.
Edge Girl.
|Just what I always wanted to be.
Well, screw him, all right?
You move on,|and you party heavily, and you'll be fine.
- You're still going to that dance, right?
|- Maybe.
You got the tix already.
|Why don't we go together?
- I don't know about that.
|- Come on.
We'll find a coupla studs, we'll use 'em and discard 'em.
|That's always fun.
OK, I'm in.
Not the stud-using part, though.
Or probably not.
Bobby.
Mashad.
You don't phone, you don't write Where's the love?
Ms Moran?
Hi.
I'm so glad that I ran into you.
I had this little incident last year|of getting kicked out of school.
And I'm back now, though.
|I've done all of my make-up tests, but I need one written|recommendation from a teacher.
I think the word|that Principal Snyder used was "glowing".
To put in my file,|so I can prove that I belong here.
And, you are Buffy.
Buffy Summers.
Third row.
I sat by the window.
Your class: Contemporary American Heroes|from Amelia Earhart to Maya Angelou.
The class that changed my life?
- Were you absent a lot|- Buffy?
Hi.
I hope you'll consider me|for Homecoming Queen.
I can't believe it.
My favourite teacher,|and she didn't even remember who I was.
I'm like a non-person.
Am I invisible?
|Can you see me?
Big as life.
At Hemey I was Prom Princess, I was Fiesta|Queen, I was on the cheerleading squad.
And the yearbook was, like, a story of me.
Now it's senior year, and I'll be one crappy|picture on one eighth of one crappy page.
- No, actually, you're not.
|- What do you mean?
Well, you missed the picture-taking.
When?
Why?
- We did 'em yesterday.
|- Didn't Cordelia tell you?
Thanks for your support.
- Buffy, you look so cute in that outfit.
|- I'm not voting for you.
Then make it snappy.
Why didn't you tell me|about the yearbook pictures?
- Oh, I guess I forgot.
What's the big?
|- It's just You could've thought|about somebody else for 30 seconds.
- Hey, I am under a lot of pressure here.
|- Oh, yeah, campaigning.
Rough gig.
Just because you were Guacamole Queen|when you were three doesn't mean you understand|how this works.
Obviously, it involves|handing out lame flyers.
No.
It involves being part of this school|and having actual friends.
Now, if it was about monsters, blood|and innards, then you'd be a shoo-in.
- I'd like to see you try to win the crown.
|- You would?
- Then you will.
|- What does that mean?
I'm gonna show you how it's done.
I'm gonna run for Homecoming Queen,|and I'll win.
This is starting to be sad.
Sorry, Cordy, but you have no idea|who you're messing with.
What?
The Slayer?
I'm not talking about the Slayer.
|I'm talking about Buffy.
You've awakened the Prom Queen within.
And that crown is going to be mine.
Competition.
Competition is a beautiful thing.
It makes us strive.
It makes us accomplish.
Occasionally, it makes us kill.
|We all have the desire to win.
I mean, whether we're human, vampire Or whatever you are, my brother.
|You got spiny-looking head things.
I ain't never seen that before.
- I am Kulak, of the Miquot Clan.
|- Isn't that nice.
Point is, you're all here for the same reason.
It sure ain't no philosophy class, is it?
Mr Gorch, my account statement says|that your deposit has not yet been made.
Well, me and Candy we blowin' our whole|honeymoon stash on this little game here.
- They're dirty.
|- They're non-consecutive.
The games will begin in a few days' time.
|The first target, Buffy, you've all seen.
The second, Faith, is a little more elusive.
But they will be together|and ready for the killing, and that is a money-back guarantee.
Ladies, gentlemen, spiny-headed-lookin' creatures, welcome to SlayerFest '98.
What do you think of this?
- Nice.
|- It's my first big dance, you know?
Where there's a boy and a band and not just me alone in my room|pretending that there's a boy and a band.
- I just want it to be|- Yeah, special.
That's why I spared no expense on the tux.
The tux?
I thought you borrowed it|from your cousin Rigby.
Expense to my pride, Will.
They're our only relations with money,|and they shun us.
As they should.
What do you think about this?
Nice.
- What?
|- I was just Remember the eighth-grade cotillion?
|You had that clip-on?
- Yeah, I was pretty stylin' with a clip-on.
|- Now here we are, and it's - Homecoming.
|- Yeah, we should face it, Will.
You and I will be in neighbouring rest homes|while I come over so you can adjust my Well, I can't think of anything|that's not really gross, so So.
You and Oz.
How do I put this?
Are we on first, second, or ye gods?
That's none of your business,|Alexander Harris.
- Rounding second.
|- You don't know that.
- What about you and Cordelia?
|- A gentleman never talks about conquests.
Oh, yeah?
|Well, since when did you become a gentleman?
I know.
"Nice".
I was gonna go with "gorgeous".
Really?
You too.
In a guy way.
Oz is very lucky.
So is Cordelia.
In a girl way.
I don't know if I can dance in this.
|I don't know if I can dance!
Come on.
Piece of cake.
Here.
Well, that seems to Yeah.
This shouldn't be a problem.
No.
No problem.
- That didn't just happen.
|- No!
I mean, it did, but it didn't.
Because I respect you.
|And Oz.
And I would never I would never either.
|It must be the clothes.
It's a fluke.
It's a clothes fluke.
|There'll be no more fluking.
Not ever.
- We gotta get out of these clothes.
|- Right now.
- I didn't mean|- I didn't me either.
A campaign is like a war,|It's won or lost in the trenches, Holly, Michelle, and our real competition,|Cordelia, all have big head starts.
Speaking of big heads, if I had a watermelon|as big as Cordelia's, I'd be rich.
Waits for laugh OK, you're right.
Making fun of the|competition only makes me seem petty.
Now, this is just like any other|popularity contest.
I've done this before.
The only difference being|this time I'm not actually popular.
Although, I'm not exactly unpopular.
A lot|of people came to my Welcome Home party.
- But they were killed by zombies.
|- Good point.
OK, here's the plan.
Willow, I need you|to make a database.
See who's for us, who's on the fence|and where our real crisis areas are.
Oz, you take the fringe: musicians,|those not normally inclined to vote.
Xander, what Cordelia.
OK, look.
I know this is awkward, but I don't|see any reason why we can't get along during this campaign time.
|I mean, we're almost friends and we are all riding together in the limo.
Yeah, great.
|Willow, how's that database coming?
It'sjust about done.
Xander?
- I got your new flyers.
|- Let's get cracking.
She's my girlfriend.
It's just that she needs it|so much more than you do.
As Willow goes, so goes my nation.
Thanks for what you said, Buffy.
|I think we're gettin' along great.
Don't you?
Seems like a lot of fuss for one little title.
Well you know, it's no fun|if you don't try your best.
As long as fun is still in the mix.
Sure!
It's not like anyone|takes it that seriously.
- Sorry.
|- Here.
I heard you were doing this.
Yeah.
It's just something to pass the time.
- It's silly, really.
|- I don't think so.
For what it's worth, you have my vote.
No, I don't want you to feel Thank you.
- Hey.
|- Hi.
How are you?
You look good.
Anything new?
|Hey, did I mention you look good?
Willow, it's OK that you're helping Cordelia.
|We're best friends.
I won't hold it against you.
No, I'm not a friend.
|I'm a rabid dog who should be shot!
But there are forces at work.
|Dark, incomprehensible forces.
I'm sure they're more important|than all we've been through, - or the number of times I've saved your life.
|- What do you want?
- OK.
|- Good!
So, I spoke to the limo people,|and we're all set.
they'll pick up Faith, then me,|then swing by and get you guys, Now, what's your database|tell you about my weaknesses?
You know, Jonathan, I've always felt|a special bond between you and me.
Cordelia gave me six bucks.
|That buys a whole lotta cupcakes.
Are you kidding?
I've been doing|the Vulcan death grip since I was four.
You really are giving out money, huh?
Is that any more tacky than your faux|"I'm shy but deep" campaign posters?
Yes.
This whole trying to be like me|really isn't funny any more.
I was never trying to be like you,|and when was it funny?
Why should your pathetic need to recapture|your glory days splinter my vote?
How can you think it's OK to talk to people|like this?
Do you have parents?
Yeah.
Two of them unlike some people.
Your brain isn't connected|to your mouth, is it?
Why don't you do us both a favour|and stay out of my way?
Don't ever do that again.
- You're sick, you know that?
|- Let's not say something we'll regret, OK.
- You crazy freak!
|- Vapid whore!
- Like that.
|- What did you call me?
This is just then worst thing|that's ever happened.
Ever!
I know.
It's just When I look at you now, it's like|I'm seeing you for the first time.
- I'm talking about Buffy and Cordelia.
|- Me too.
What are we gonna do?
I mean, we have|to do something.
This is all our fault.
How do you get from|"chick fight" to "our fault"?
Because we felt so guilty about the fluke,|we over compensated helping Cordelia.
We spun the group dynamic out of orbit.
|We're a meteor shower heading for Earth OK, calm down.
Let's put our heads together|and think of somethin'.
OK, now, one of us here|is pretty darn smart, and I am just in hell.
I mean, I thought being a senior - at last - and having a girlfriend - at last -|would be a good thing.
Now, why wouldn't that be a good thing?
What?
Sometimes when you're falling to pieces,|your mouth, it just does the sweetest thing.
What are we gonna do?
We just have to get|the two of them communicating.
I'm talking about us.
What's going on here?
Where's Faith?
"Dear Cordelia and Buffy.
|We won't be riding to the dance with you".
"Work out your problems.
Our friendships|are more important than who wins".
"Your friends".
"PS.
The limo was not cheap.
Work it out".
Well - They bought us corsages?
|- I took the orchid.
OK.
I don't see what the big deal is.
I'm not making a big deal.
|You wanted the orchid, you got the orchid.
It goes with my complexion better.
It does have that sallow tint.
Finally we're here.
What is this?
OK, guys, we've had enough|of your stupid little games.
What's massively wrong with this picture?
Hello, ladies, Welcome to SlayerFest '98, What is a SlayerFest, you ask?
Well, as in most of life,|there's the hunters and the hunted, Can you guess where you two fall?
From the beginning of this tape,|you have exactly 30 seconds,,, no, that's 17 now, to run for your lives, Faith, Buffy,,, Have a nice death, Hello!
How stupid are you people?
She's a Slayer.
I'm a Homecoming Queen.
What are you two so mopy about?
Oh, we're not mopy.
We're groovin'.
On Oz's band.
He's a great guy, Oz.
He wrote this song for me.
Sleazebag.
We have to find Buffy.
|Something terrible's happened.
Just kidding.
|Thought I'd give you a scare.
Are those finger sandwiches?
I have an idea.
We talk to these people, we explain|that I'm not a slayer and they let me go.
Look out!
Get down!
That's gotta smart.
I can let you out of that,|or put a bullet in your head.
How many are there in this little game|and what are they packing?
There's me, two Germans with AR-15s|and grenade launcher, yellow-skinned demon with long knives,|vampire couple from Texas named Gorch.
- That everybody?
|- Everybody who's out here.
Germans are wired.
Their boss is tracking 'em|on computer.
Now get me out of this!
Could I just ask you an eensy favour?
Could|you just tell your friends that I'm not a sl Scott?
There you are, honey!
|Hey, good news.
Doctor says the itching and burning should|clear up, but we gotta use the ointment.
Hi!
I suspect the finger food contains actual fingers.
I think I'll retreat to the library|until the coronation.
I want to be here when Buffy|Well, however the thing turns out for her.
And that was a very fine thing you two did,|putting Buffy and Cordelia together.
We did one fine thing.
Yeah.
They've been gone awhile.
|Must really be getting into it.
We should be safe in here for a while.
|You need to find a weapon.
Safe?
I'm not safe.
I'm gonna die.
Yeah, you are if you just stand there.
I'm never gonna be crowned|Homecoming Queen.
I'm never gonna graduate from high school.
I'm never gonna know if it's real|between me and Xander, or if it's just some temporary insanity that made me think I loved him.
And now I'm never|gonna get the chance to tell him.
Yes, you are.
We'll head back to the library,|where Giles and the rest of the weapons live.
Then I'll take out the rest,|in time for you to congratulate me on my sweeping victory|as Homecoming Queen.
I know what you're up to.
You think if you get me mad enough,|I won't be so scared.
And, hey!
It's working.
|Where's a damn weapon?
- You really love Xander?
|- Well, he kinda grows on you, like a Chia Pet.
- That's it?
|- Just this and a telephone.
A telephone.
|And you didn't you think that'd be helpful?
No, this is better for You're about to see why Daniel Boone and|that idiot demon are creatures of the past, and why I am the future.
I'm picking up a signal.
They've got a phone!
If you get this message, Giles,|get help and get out here Hello?
- What happened?
|- It went dead.
- Want me to cut that leg off?
|- No, thanks.
Continue proceeding South|90 metres to vector three, Giles, it's me, And Cordelia, We're in a cabin|in Miller's Woods, and we're in big trouble, Why is it every time I go somewhere with|you, it always ends in violence and terror?
- Welcome to my life.
|- I don't wanna be in your life.
I wanna be in my life.
Well, there's the door.
Please feel free|to walk out at anytime and live your life.
All I wanted was to be Homecoming Queen.
And that's all I wanted too, Cordelia.
I spent a year's allowance on this dress.
I don't get why you care about Homecoming|when you're doing stuff like this.
Because this is all I do.
|This is what my life is.
You couldn't understand.
I just thought Homecoming Queen.
I could pick up a yearbook someday|and say "I was there".
I went to high school, I had friends, and, for one moment, I got to live in the world.
And there'd be proof.
Proof that I was chosen|for something other than this.
Besides I look cute in a tiara.
Do you hear Cor, the gun!
Cordelia, the spatula.
Prepare to launch.
target's in range, Ready your weapon, Y-axis 53 degrees west by 8 degrees south, Launch.
We gotta get back to the library.
Easy, darlin'.
These things go through you|faster than Grandpa Pete's chilli.
I wanna do Buffy.
My weddin' present|for what happened to your poor brother.
- Tector.
|- When's she comin'?
Well, he's her watcher.
She'll show -just as soon as she|gets rid of some of our competition.
They're heading west.
Back into town.
- They got away?
|- Temporarily.
Well, give it up for the slayers.
|They got character.
I'll take care of it.
Evening, gentlemen.
How may I help you?
Excuse me.
Anybody got a warrant here?
Jungle Bob and spike-head are down and out.
|The Germans keep finding us.
If we take them out,|we can still make Homecoming.
Those animals!
Hunting us down|like poor defenceless Well, animals.
We just need to find Gil Candy!
I'm gonna kill both you slayers for this!
|You hear me?
I hear you, you redneck moron.
|You got a dress that goes with that hat?
I'm gonna Rip out my innards, play with my eyeballs,|boil my brain and eat it for brunch?
Listen up, needle-brain.
We've taken out|four of your cronies and your girlfriend.
- Wife!
|- Whatever.
The point is, I haven't even broken a sweat.
|See, in the end, Buffy's just the runner-up.
I'm the queen.
You get me mad,|what do you think I'm gonna do to you?
Later.
That should teach him|to mistake you for a slayer.
Yes, I must admit I do feel partly responsible.
I did give your friends tacit approval|to make the switch in the limousine.
It's OK.
It gave Cor and I a chance|to spend some quality death time.
- And we got these free corsages.
|- Oh.
That's nice.
Although I don't recall|them mentioning corsages.
Jungle Bob said that the Germans|were hooked into a computer system.
And they're hooked into us.
- Oh God, get rid of these things.
|- I need some wet toilet paper.
Yeah!
That'll help.
transmitting coordinates now, They're 50 feet away.

I won.
- Hello!
Nice to meet you.
|- Yeah.
Hi, it's a pleasure.
Where am I?
In my office.
I'm Richard Wilkins,|Mayor of Sunnydale.
And you're Mr Trick.
Please, sit down.
That's an exciting suit.
- Well, clothes make the man.
|- Well, as I understand it, you're not a man exactly.
Mr Trick, I've been the Mayor|for quite some time.
I like things to run smoothly.
|This is a very important year for me.
- Election year.
|- Something like that.
If you're telling me I don't fit in here|in your quiet neighbourhood, you can just skip it, cos that all got old|long before I became a vampire.
Do you have children?
Children are the heart of a community.
|They need to be looked after.
Controlled.
The more rebellious element|needs to be dealt with.
The children are our future.
|We need them.
I need them.
If this rebellious element|means who I think it does, that problem may be|taken care of this very night.
So I've heard.
That's a very enterprising idea|you have: SlayerFest.
I love that name, by the way.
You see,|that's the kind of initiative I need on my team.
- What if I don't wanna be a part of the team?
|- Oh, no, that won't be an issue.
See, you and I are gonna get along very well.
Moist towelette?
Hey, guys, the moment|we've all been waiting for.
They're gonna announce the queen.
|Where are they?
What's keeping them?
I'm gonna go with mud wrestling.
- Oh, God!
What did you do to each other?
|- Long story.
- Got hunted.
|- Apparently not that long.
Tell you one thing, though:|you don't wanna mess with Cordelia.
No.
In this envelope, I hold the name|of this year's Homecoming Queen.
After all we've been through tonight,|this whole queen-capade seems pretty - Damn important.
|- Oh, yeah.
And the winner is Hey, I believe we have a first|for Sunnydale High.
We have a tie.
The winners are Holly Charleston|and Michelle Blake.
I'm just so honoured.
I can't believe it!
I mean,|that you would pick me - or us - out of every girl in the whole school.
|It's just so wonderful!
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
"And on that tragic day,|an era came to its inevitable end".
- That's all there is.
Are you ready?
|- Hit me.
"Which best expresses the theme of the|passage?
Violence breeds violence"?
" All things must end?
C" B. I'm going with B.|We haven't had a B in for ever.
This is the SATs, Buffy, not connect-the-dots.
Pay attention.
A low score could harm|your chances of getting into college.
That takes the pressure right off.
It isn't meant to be easy.
It's a rite of passage.
Is it too late to join a tribe where they just|pierce something or cut something off?
Buffy, please concentrate.
- Roll.
|- What?
I broke my number two pencil.
|We'll have to do this again sometime.
" All systems tend towards chaos".
I just know that us and the undead are the|only people in Sunnydale working this late.
I appreciate you coming.
I realise it is early - for you - but I think you'll agree that|this matter is urgent, also delicate.
- I'm a very delicate person.
|- So you feel you can handle this?
It's a little out of my element,|but I can get you what you need.
I know a beast who knows a guy.
Are you sure that subcontracting|is the way to go here?
This guy's worked your town before, and if he lives up to his rep,|this place'll be in flames.
I've made certain deals to get where I am|today.
This demon requires his tribute.
You see, that's what separates me|from other politicians, Mr Trick.
I keep my campaign promises.
Where'd I put that Scotch?
Then I was being chased by an answer|bubble screaming "None of the above".
Wow.
I hope that wasn't|one of your prophecy dreams.
Probably not.
I took it last year.
I could help you get ready.
There's this whole trick to antonyms,|but this isn't the place.
Oz is the highest-scoring person|ever to fail to graduate.
- Isn't she cute when she's proud?
|- She's always cute.
- We could work on it tonight.
|- Work on what?
- Oh, God.
Are we killing something again?
|- Only my carefree spirit.
- Buffy SAT prep.
|- Oz is helping.
He's the highest-scoring We know.
We did|the impressed thing already.
I hate that thing.
It's totally fascist, and|it discriminates against the uninformed.
Actually, I'm looking forward to it.
|I do well on standardised tests.
What?
I can't have layers?
- So, Buff, study tonight?
|- Yes on the studying, no on tonight.
I'm putting in Mom time.
|She's been drastic since I got back.
And Giles is even worse.
I'm supervised 24-7.
It's like being in|the Real World house, only real.
Candy bars.
Lots of 'em.
Principal Snyder, thank you.
You weren't visited by the Ghost|of Christmas Past, by any chance?
- It's band candy.
|- Let's hear it for the band.
Very generous.
You will sell it to raise money for the|marching band.
They need new uniforms.
- Yeah.
Those tall, fuzzy hats ain't cheap.
|- But they go with everything.
We love the idea of going all Willy Loman,|but we're not in the band.
And if I'd handed you a trombone,|that would've been a problem, Summers.
It's candy.
Sell it.
- But you're not in the band.
|- And yet.
Buffy, what would I do|with 40 chocolate bars?
You could hand them out at the gallery.
"Buy|something pre-Colombian, get a free cavity".
- You're a good mom.
|- I'm the best.
No, I'm pretty sure the best moms|let their daughters drive.
- And yet.
|- Come on.
- Look, let's not have this conversation.
|- But I took the class.
I watched the film strips with the blood|and the corpses.
I'm prepped.
Honey, you failed the written test.
They|wouldn't even let you take the road test.
That was a year ago.
And I don't test well,|she said, two days before the SATs.
I spend enough time|not knowing where you are.
I don't wanna add the possibility|that you're on the highway to Chicago.
I can't believe you.
I'm not taking off again.
- Besides, I could just get on a bus.
|- Stop.
Don't.
I just don't want you driving, OK?
|I want you here.
I'm here.
See me here.
- I gotta go.
|- What, you're going out?
Giles.
Slay-study double feature.
|Could be late.
Again?
Honey, don't you think Mr Giles|is monopolising an awful lot of your time?
And does he ever say he's sorry?
Sorry.
- Why do I put up with this?
|- Because it is your destiny.
And because I just bought|20 coco-rific candy bars.
You're doing this to take|funny pictures of me.
I'm doing it to test your awareness|of an opponent's location during a fight in total darkness.
Now, wait five seconds|and then throw the ball at me.
You ran out of new training ideas|about a week ago, huh?
OK.
Five, four, three, two, one.
It's not that simple, is it?
Yes, well, very good.
- Thanks.
|- Where are you going?
We have to patrol.
I can't.
Mom's in hyperdrive.
|She wants me home tonight.
- But, I|- I know.
She's out of control.
Enjoy the candy.
Buffy.
I didn't know you could do that.
I'm feelin' better.
Angel.
Let's go inside.
It's late.
How'd you get away?
It was easy.
Started a fire|in the prison laundry room.
Rode out in the garbage truck.
I'm joking.
No garbage.
Smell me.
How is Scott?
Scott?
Boyfriend Scott.
Actually, he's not He's fine.
That's for you.
- It's fresh from the butcher.
|- Thanks.
- You're being careful, right?
|- With Scott?
The slaying.
Yeah, of course.
Full of carefulness.
I worry about you.
I worry about you.
- I'm gettin' stronger.
|- Yeah, pretty soon you won't even need me.
That'll be better.
Yeah.
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.
You know Giles.
All slay, all the time.
Hello, Buffy.
Do you wanna watch television?
|There's a very insightful Nightline on.
Buffy, you lied to us.
|And you made us into your alibis.
That's playing us against each other|and that's not fair.
I called Willow.
You also lied to her about|your whereabouts.
We were all concerned.
- Thank you.
|- Look, I'm sorry, but I had to Were you at the Bronze?
What was|happening there that was so important?
- Bronze things.
Things of Bronze.
|- You're acting really immature, Buffy.
I'm not your parent, but I am|responsible for you.
She's right.
OK, I'm acting like a child.
Maybe because|you're both treating me like a child.
- Buffy.
|- You're both scheduling me 24 hours a day.
Between the two of you, that's 48 hours.
|I wanna make a few decisions on my own.
The last time you made a decision, you split.
Yeah, and I took care of myself.
|I don't need this much active parenting.
You can't try using this summer|as a reason you should be trusted.
You can't baby-sit me all the time.
|I need you to back off a little.
All right, come on.
Let's not freak out.
- Freak out?
|- I think you should go to bed.
We're all tired.
She just drives me crazy.
I just wanna protect her.
Don't all parents want that?
But at least most parents have some idea|what to protect their children from.
Yeah.
And I think we should both|be especially careful.
Trust me.
You don't wanna eat that.
Think fast.
I heard there's a secret rule that if a teacher's|more than 10 minutes late, we can all leave.
It's Giles' turn to watch study hall.
|He'll be here.
He's allergic to late.
He is wound a little tight.
I had this philosophy book checked out|from the library for a year, and he made me pay the fine,|even though it was huge.
It was sad to return it.
It was perfect for|starting conversations with college boys.
- Of course, that was BX.
|- BX?
Before Xander.
Clever.
- I like chocolate.
There is no bad here.
|- You still have some left?
I went to four houses and they were gone.
|It's like trick-or-treating in reverse.
I know.
They're selling like hot cakes, which|is ironic, cos the hot cakes aren't movin'.
And it's fun to sell chocolate.
And we're raising a lot of money for the band.
The band, yeah.
They're great.
- They march.
|- Like an army.
Except with music instead of bullets,|and usually no one dies.
I can't believe this.
Where is Giles already?
I'm bored,|and he's not here to give me credit for it.
The big pinhead librarian didn't show up,|and I don't wanna do it.
You do it.
All right, fine.
I'll do it.
Everybody expects me to do everything|around here because I'm the principal.
It's not fair.
Hey!
We're all stuck here.
So let's just sit quietly|and pretend we're reading something until we're really sure that|old Commandant Snyder's gone.
- Then we're all outta here!
|- Does anyone else wanna marry Ms Barton?
- Get in line.
|- I guess Giles isn't coming?
I guess not.
Buffy.
Sorry.
I was just worried.
|You were a big not-there in study hall.
After your lecture on not ducking out|What is my mother doing here?
We had an opportunity for,|you might say, a summit meeting.
It took priority over study hall.
I called in.
- We decided you made a good point earlier.
|- I did, yeah.
- Which was?
|- About us over scheduling you.
Pulling you in two directions, your home life and your duties as a slayer.
- That was a good point.
|- We're working out a schedule for you.
It'll be tight, but I think we can|fit in all your responsibilities.
Sounds nice and structured.
We've got more work to do here, honey.
|Why don't you give us a little more time?
Take the car, and Mr Giles|can drive me home.
What?
Excuse me, I meant what?
Keys.
Take them.
You don't have to tell me twice.
|Well, actually, you did, but bye.
Bye, honey.
Drive careful.
- Do you think she noticed anything?
|- No way.
Tell me again how it happened.
I told my mom I wanted to be treated|more like a grown-up and voilà: driviness.
Also I think she wanted me otherwhere.
|Considering they're planning my future, I think it's easier for them|to live my life if I'm not actually there.
Do you know that|you have the parking brake on?
Are you sure about the Bronze?
|I mean, the SATs are tomorrow.
I can study at the Bronze.
|A little dancing, a little cross-multiplying.
You know what we need?
Eyes on the road.
Eyes on the road!
- You got good albums.
|- Yeah, they're OK.
Do you like Seals and Croft?
Yeah, me neither.
Thanks.
So how come they call you Ripper?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wait a minute.
Listen to this bit.
- It rocks.
|- It's good.
Man, I gotta get a band together.
Hey, Ripper, you wanna watch TV?
- I know how to order pay-per-view.
|- No, let's go out, have some fun.
- Tear things up a bit.
|- OK.
We could go to the Bronze.
Not bloody likely.
That place is dead.
Hey, they're diggin' us, man.
Let's do the time warp again.
Maybe there's a reunion in town|or a Billy Joel tour or something.
- Ms Barton?
|- Buffy?
Whoa!
- Are you OK, Ms Barton?
|- I'm cool, Willow.
Willow.
That's a tree.
You're a tree.
Are there any nachos in here, little tree?
Are you sure you don't need|some fresh air, Ms Barton?
OK.
This is not normal.
- Maybe that goes without saying.
|- Hey, gang.
This place is Fun City, huh?
- Principal Snyder?
|- Call me Snyder.
Just a last name, like Barbarino.
|I'm so stoked!
Did you see Ms Barton?
I think she's wasted.
I'm gonna have to put that in her next|performance review cos I'm the principal.
I don't like this.
|They could have heart attacks.
Well, maybe there's a doctor here.
I think that is my doctor.
He's usually less topless.
I got a commendation for being principal.
|From the Mayor.
Shook my hand twice.
That's nice.
There are some foxy ladies here tonight.
- What's happening?
|- I don't know.
But it's happening|to a whole lot of grown-ups.
- They're acting like a bunch|- They're acting like a bunch of us.
I don't act like this.
- Demand's high.
|- I thought it might be.
I love this county.
You make a good product|and the people will come to you.
Of course, a lot of them are gonna die, but|that's the other reason I love this county.
- Hey!
Don't sample the product.
|- I didn't.
- OK.
How did you know he was|- I don't.
Now I know no one else will.
We're gettin' close.
Keep it flowin'.
It's almost feedin' time.
- Something's definitely changing them.
|- A spell?
They're teenagers.
|It's a sobering mirror to look into, huh?
You've got great hair.
It just gets more upsetting.
No vampire has ever been that scary.
Fight!
We gotta figure out what's going on.
|This has Hellmouth fingerprints all over it.
Where are we going?
Wait up, you guys!
Hey!
You guys aren't trying|to ditch me, are ya?
- Giles'll know what's going on.
|- For all we know, he's sweet 16 again.
He's with your mom at his place.
- I said wait up.
|- Snyder No time.
He's coming with us.
Whoa, Summers!
You drive like a spaz!
It'll be OK when we get to Giles'.
Of course, even if he's 16, he's still Giles.
|He's probably a pretty together guy.
- Yeah, well|- What?
Giles at 16?
Less "together" guy, more "bad magic, hates the world,|ticking time bomb" guy.
Well, then, I guess|your mom's in a lotta trouble.
- Must be exciting being from England.
|- Not particularly.
You cold?
- I feel special.
Like I'm just waking up, kinda.
|- Yeah?
Like getting married and having a kid|and everything was just a dream and now things are back|like they're supposed be.
That's cool.
Very Juice Newton.
- You fancy it?
|- Yeah, but the store's closed.
Ripper, that was so brave.
Hold it!
This is great.
Let's do doughnuts|in the football field, huh?
Oh, my God, look out!
Copper's got a gun.
- You'll never use it, though, mate.
|- Will so.
Ripper, be careful.
Told him he'd never use it.
You are so cool.
You're like Burt Reynolds.
Sorry.
Gotta go.
Oh, God!
Are you guys OK?
Is anybody else all creeped out and trembly?
Buffy, your mom's gonna kill you.
- Something's weird.
|- Something's not?
No grown-ups.
No one's protecting their houses.
|Everyone's just wandering.
Hey!
Hey, give it!
- Defenceless.
|- Come on!
That's mine!
- So where are all the vampires?
|- He stole my candy.
- Soup's on but no one's grabbing a spoon.
|- Something's happening - someplace that's else.
|- I'd say something big.
That guy took my candy.
The candy.
It's gotta be the candy.
It's cursed.
A curse?
I've got a curse.
God, using candy for evil.
My parents ate a ton.
- Who's behind it?
|- I don't know.
It came through the school board.
|If you knew that crowd Where did it come from?
|Do you know where to get it?
Yeah.
Get Xander and Cordelia.
|Go to the library and look it up.
- Candy curses?
|- Disturbing second childhood.
Got it.
Rat Boy and I are going to the source.
- Mom?
Giles?
|- Go away.
We're busy.
Mom!
Where did you get that coat?
|Never mind.
Listen - Back off.
|- Giles, think about this.
You wanna fight me|or you wanna let me talk to my mother?
Mom, look at me.
Do you know who I am?
Of course.
You're Buffy.
They're giving|away candy.
You want some candy?
No, I don't.
|And you don't need any more, either.
I'm fine.
I can have more if I want.
- You are not fine.
You need to go home.
|- Screw you.
- I want candy.
|- Mom.
You wanna slay stuff|and I'm not allowed to do anything.
Well, this is what I wanna do,|so get off my back.
- Mom, please|- For God's sake.
- Let your mum have her sodding candy.
|- Look at that dent in your car.
I did that.
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking|when I bought the Geek Machine?
- Listen to me.
You|- You listen to me.
I'm your watcher, so you do what I tell you.
|Now, sod off!
- Take her home.
|- Joyce Mom.
You leave her alone.
Hey, Brit Face.
Wait up.
Stay.
- It smells so chocolaty.
|- This is far out.
Yeah, I've been out there.
Town's wide open.
|You guys can go anytime.
Ethan Rayne.
Might wanna hurry.
Ethan.
Ripper.
At first it was fun.
They seemed like|they were in this really good mood, - not like parents, and then|- Badness?
Mom started borrowing my clothes.
|There should be an age limit on Lycra pants.
And Dad, he just locked himself in the|bathroom with old copies of Esquire, I don't get this.
The candy makes|you feel immature and stuff, but I've had a ton and I don't feel any dif - Never mind.
|- I'll take that one.
- You wanna swap?
|- What?
Swap?
You wanna swap?
This book is really thick,|and I'm not sure it's in English.
Bloody hell!
That's what smoking'll do to you.
|Now be quiet.
Where'd the bastard go?
What?
Look.
A box full of farm-fresh chicken.
Do you suppose they're OK?
So are you two kinda like goin' steady?
So, Ethan, what are we playing?
|We're in a talk-or-bleed situation.
Your call.
Hit him.
I'd just like to point out|that this wasn't my idea.
- Meaning?
|- I'm subcontracting.
It's Trick you want.
I'm just helping him collect|a tribute for a demon.
- He's lying.
|- I don't think he is, and shut up.
- You're my slayer.
Knock his teeth down|- Giles!
- What demon?
|- I don't remember.
Yes!
Lurconis.
Demon named Lurconis.
They wanted away|to get the tribute away from people.
- So you're just Diversion Guy?
|- More than a diversion.
They said the tribute was so big that|people would never let them take it, that people had to be out of it.
Later, when the candy wore off,|they'd blame themselves.
Hence land of the irresponsible.
|So where's Trick?
- I don't know exactly.
|- Hit him again.
No.
I really don't know.
Delivering the tribute.
Which brings us to the bonus question, and|a wrong answer will cost you all your points.
What's the tribute?
Right.
Lurconis.
Lurconis.
A demon.
What's his deal?
- See if it says anything about a tribute.
|- A tribute?
Like what?
I don't know.
- My source is all tapped out.
|- She whupped you good, huh?
I can do that.
I took taekwondo at the Y. No, it's definitely a demon.
A big one.
Giles, give me the gun.
Giles.
Now.
It's Willow.
She wants you real bad.
Oz just found it.
"The tribute|to Lurconis is made every 30 years".
It's a ritual feeding.
And this one's late,|so it's probably, you know, a big meal.
Lurconis eats babies.
- Come on.
|- Well, what about that man?
See if you can find something|to tie him up with.
Never tell me.
I didn't see anything.
|I don't know where they are.
Something's gonna eat those babies?
- What can I do?
|- I think that is so wrong.
- Get off my back about it!
|- She never saw who took 'em.
Dozy cow.
- I know who took them.
|- Let's do something.
Let's find the demon|and kick the crap out of it.
- Is that what happens now?
|- Yeah, if we knew where they were.
"Lurconis dwells beneath the city,|filth to filth".
What?
I know this.
I knew this.
Lurconis means "glutton".
And we'll find it - in the sewers.
|- The sewers?
Good.
You go do that thing with the demon, and I'll stay here in case|the babies find their way back.
- The babies must be so scared.
|- You filthy little ponce.
- Are you afraid of a little demon?
|- You wanna splash around in the pooh!
You know what?
Everybody just stop it!
|OK, listen to me.
I need help, OK?
Giles, I need grown-ups.
These children are gonna die|if we don't act now, OK, and think clearly.
There is no room for mistakes.
Besides which, you guys|are just wigging me out.
Sorry.
- We'll behave.
|- Good.
Snyder, go home.
- I can do that.
|- Giles, we're going to the sewers.
And don't do that.
Come on, big guy.
|They're not gettin' any fresher.
Carol.
Hi.
Yeah.
Call Dave on the public-works committee|tomorrow about sewer maintenance.
I have some concerns regarding exposed|gas pipes, infrastructure, ventilation.
And cancel my three o'clock.
Hi.
What the hell's that?
Lurconis, I'm thinking.
Ordinarily, I like other people to do my|fighting, but I just gotta see what you got.
- Just tell me when it hurts.
|- Come on.
Giles!
No!
You and me, girl.
There's high times ahead.
They never just leave.
|Always gotta say something.
Can we go home now?
Yeah, we can go home.
|I've got the SATs tomorrow.
Blow them off.
I'll write you a note.
No.
It's OK.
Poor babies.
Come on.
- And your friend?
|- Paid him.
The man did his job.
|No reason to burn that bridge.
- This didn't turn out the way I had planned.
|- Where's the downside?
You just got yourself one less demon|you have to pay tribute to.
The way I see it, I did you a favour.
I guess you did.
In the future I'd be very careful|how many favours you do for me.
Hey, Snyder.
Heard you had some fun|Friday night.
Have you come down yet?
- That's Principal Snyder.
|- And that's a big yep.
You look like four young people|with too much time on your hands.
- Not really.
|- Busy like a bee, actually.
- Bee-like.
|- Good.
It seems we had some vandalism|Friday on school property, and I was just looking for some|volunteers to help clean it up.
Kiss rocks?
Why would anyone wanna kiss Wait.
I get it.
Let's get you some paint remover.
It was just too much to deal with.
It was like nothing made sense any more.
The things that I thought|I understood were gone.
I just felt so alone.
- Was that the math or the verbal?
|- Mostly the math.
Well, if you scored low,|then you can always take them again.
More SATs?
Is there really a point?
|I could die before I even apply to college.
- And then you very possibly might not.
|- Well, let's just keep hope alive.
- Hello.
|- Hi.
I say, your car seems to have had|an adventure, doesn't it?
Buffy assures me that|it happened battling evil, so I'm letting her pay for it|on the instalment plan.
The way things were going,|be glad that's the worst that happened.
At least I got to the two of you|before you actually did something.
- Right.
|- Indeed.
Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
If I could walk out You know I never lied Oz!
Hey.
Have a seat.
Except we don't have any seats.
It's OK.
I'll just scrunch in.
- Xander, why are you giving me a lap dance?
|- What?
I just like ya.
And that's very beautiful.
I think it's great|when two people like two people and wanna be close to them|instead of anyone else.
- Hear, hear!
|- Yeah, well put.
Can I snag a sip?
- Sure.
|- You got it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
We're here|through Saturday.
Enjoy the veal.
Why are you guys so hyper?
Hey, speaking of people and things|they do that aren't like usual, anyone notice Buffy acting sort of different?
Let's see, killing zombies,|torching sewer monsters and No, that's pretty much the same old Buffster.
I just mean she's off by herself a lot|more, and she's kind of distracted.
Think maybe she has a new honey?
A boyfriend?
Why wouldn't she tell us?
Excuse me?
When your last steady|killed half the class, then your rebound guy sends you|a dump-a-gram?
It makes a girl shy.
But we're the best of Buffy's|bestest buds.
She'd tell us.
Tell you what?
About your new boyfriend,|who we made up.
Unless we didn't.
- This was a topic of discussion?
|- Raised, but never discussed.
So, are you dating somebody or not?
I wouldn't use the word "dating".
But I am going out with somebody.
|Tonight, as a matter of fact.
- Really?
Who?
|- What's up?
Time to motivate.
Really, we're just good friends.
- What do you think?
|- Sloppy.
You telegraph punches,|leave blind sides open, and, for a school-night slaying, take entirely|too much time.
Which one of you is Faith?
It depends.
Who the hell are you?
Gwendolyn Post.
Mrs. Your new watcher.
I'm telling you, I don't need a new watcher.
No offence, lady.
I just have|this problem with authority figures.
They end up kinda dead.
Duly noted.
Fortunately, it's not up to you.
Mr Giles, where do you keep|the rest of your books?
- I'm sorry, the rest?
|- Yes, the actual library.
Oh.
I see.
I assure you, Mrs Post,|this is the finest occult reference collection This side of the Atlantic.
I'm sure.
Do you have Hume's|Paranormal Encyclopaedia?
the Labyrinth Maps of Malta?
It's on order.
I suppose you have Sir Robert Kane's|Twilight Compendium?
Yes, I Yes, I do.
Yes, of course you do.
I have been sent by the Council|for a very important reason.
Faith needs a watcher.
I am to act in that capacity and report back.
Excuse me, Mary Poppins,|you don't seem to be listening Faith, if the Council feels|you need closer observation, then we will all, of course, cooperate.
The Council wishes me to report on|the entire situation here, including you.
Academic probation's|not so funny today, huh, Giles?
The fact is there's talk in the Council|that you have become a bit too American.
- Me?
|- Him?
A demon named Lagos|is coming here to the Hellmouth.
Mr Giles, an illustration|of Lagos, if you please.
Yes.
Perhaps later.
Lagos seeks the Glove of Myhnegon.
No record of this glove's full power exists, but we do know it is highly dangerous|and must not fall into the hands of a demon.
Lagos must be stopped.
What do you propose?
Well, if it's not too radical a suggestion,|I thought we might kill him.
I suggest two slayers at full strength|for a coordinated hunt.
We believe the glove to be|buried in a tomb somewhere, so Lagos will be headed for the cemetery.
There is more than one in Sunnydale.
I see.
How many?
Twelve within the city limits.
Well, we'll just have|to take them one at a time.
Anything in your books that might pinpoint|the location of the tomb would be useful.
But then, we cannot ask for miracles.
We will begin tomorrow at sunset.
Faith?
With me, please.
That was bracing.
Interesting lady.
Can we kill her?
I think the Council might frown upon that.
Well, how do you feel|about a spot of training?
I'd better go.
Big night for us slayer types.
People to see, demons to kill Better hurry before somebody|figures out what we're doing.
What are we doing?
Training.
And almost kissing.
I'm sorry.
It's just old habit.
Bad, bad habit, to be broken.
It's hard.
It's not hard.
Cold turkey.
|That's the key to quitting.
You think they make a patch for this?
- You have to go.
|- I really do.
I'm gonna try and vent a little hormonal angst|by killing a Lagos, whatever that is.
Lagos?
Some demon looking for some|all-powerful thingumabob and I gotta stop him|before he unleashes unholy havoc and it's another Tuesday night in Sunnydale.
Be careful.
This is intolerable.
There's not|a word here about Lagos or the glove.
We don't have time for this near-missing.
Just find out all you can about the demon,|its strengths, weaknesses, places of origin and, most importantly, what it|plans to do with this blasted glove.
Hey, you're not the watcher of me.
Then go home.
But if you|choose to stay, then work.
It's late, I'm tired.
|What does he want from us anyway?
The number of a qualified surgeon|to remove the British flag from his butt?
My eyes are all blurry.
Stop.
Right.
Stop means no.
And no means no, so, uh, stop.
Willow, Xander,|you can stop your, uh, studying.
I've got what I need.
What have you got?
The probable location|of the Glove of Myhnegon.
It's housed in the Von Hauptman family crypt.
Yeah, that's that big one|over at the Restfield Cemetery.
Well, that's great, Giles.
How'd you find it?
I looked.
- Where's Buffy at?
|- I'm not sure.
Well, I'll go check out this crypt.
|Tell her heads up if she stops by.
Yes, by all means, go.
And I'll just keep studying.
I think we're|on the verge of a big Lagos breakthrough.
No, I'd say we're done.
Ronnie, deadbeat.
Steve, klepto.
Kenny, drummer!
Eventually I just had to face up|to my destiny as a loser magnet.
Now it's strictly "get some, get gone".
|You can't trust guys.
You can trust some guys.
Really.
I've read about them.
Yeah.
So what about you?
You mean, like, me and guys me?
|Not much to tell these days.
But you gotta have stories.
I mean, I've had my share of losers,|but you boinked the undead.
What was that like?
Life with Angel is was complicated.
- It's still a little hard for me to talk about.
|- Well, try.
Look, Faith, all the Angel issues are still kind|of with me, so if you don't mind I'd rather not.
Yeah.
Yeah, whatever.
You know what?
We're 0-for-6 tonight.
|Why don't we just blow this off?
I am kinda beat.
But Shady Hill's pretty close.
I'll swing through it.
It's on my way anyway.
- Alone?
I don't know if I feel|- I got Miss Priss on my back now.
I don't need another baby-sitter.
|I'll holler if I have any fun.
OK.
- Later.
|- Thanks.
Son of a bitch, it's my lucky day.
Hey, Giles, here's a nifty idea.
Why don't I alleviate my guilt by going out|and getting myself really, really killed?
- Oh, God.
|- Buffy What am I doing?
What are you doing?
- I don't know.
|- Shame on you.
Oh, God.
I don't even|know why I came back here.
It's good you did.
I think I have what you're looking for.
Great.
Just, wherever this was gift wrapped,|remind me not to shop there.
The Glove of Myhnegon.
- The world's ugliest fashion accessory.
|- Don't.
Once you put it on|the glove can never be removed.
So no touching.
Kinda like us.
You hold onto it.
I'll tell Giles in the morning.
At least he'll be happy.
Ah, yes!
There we are.
There's a wood engraving.
|See?
The Glove of Myhnegon.
Yes, engraved by|Father Theodore of Wolsham.
Based, I believe, on very sketchy|and unreliable folk legends.
The pictures are fun, Mr Giles, but one|really ought to read the nice words as well.
Yes.
Some tea, perhaps.
I know that you must find me tiresome,|but it's insidious really.
One slips up on the little things and soon|everything's gone to hell in a handbasket.
For example, Buffy, your slayer.
Mrs Post, I can assure you that Buffy|is both dedicated and industrious.
And I am in complete control of my slayer.
Giles, we have a big problem.
It's Buffy.
Will you excuse us?
Would you like some assistance?
Thank you.
That won't be necessary.
Lagos is out of luck.
|I got the magic mitten thingy.
What's with all the tragedy masks?
Better take a seat, Buffy.
What's going on?
We know Angel is alive.
Xander saw you with him.
It would appear that you've been|hiding him and that you lied to us.
Nobody's here to blame you, Buffy.
|But this is serious.
You need help.
It's not what you think.
Hope not.
Cos I think|you're harbouring a vicious killer.
This isn't about attacking Buffy.
Remember, "I" statements only.
|"I feel angry", "I feel worried" Fine.
Here's one.
I feel worried - about me!
Last time, Angel barely laid a hand on Buffy.
|He was more interested in killing her friends.
- But he's better now.
|- Better for how long, Buffy?
Did you even think about that?
What is this?
Demons Anonymous?
|I don't need an intervention here.
Don't you?
You must have|known it was wrong seeing Angel, or you wouldn't have|hidden it from all of us.
I was going to tell you.
I was.
It was just that|I didn't know why he came back.
I just wanted to wait.
For what?
For Angel to go psycho again|the next time you give him a happy?
I'm not going to We're not together like that.
But you were kissing him.
You were spying on me?
What gives you the right?
What gives you the right to suck face|with your demon lover again?
- It was an accident.
|- What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?
It was wrong, OK?
I know that,|and I know that it can't happen again.
But you guys have to believe me,|I would never put you in any danger.
If I thought for a second|Angel was gonna hurt anyone You would stop him.
Like you did last time with Ms Calendar.
Buffy, I feel that when it comes|to Angel you can't see straight.
And that's why we're all|gonna help you face this.
But he's better now, I swear.
He's the one|that found the Glove of Myhnegon.
- He's keeping it safe in the mansion.
|- Right.
Great plan.
Leave tons of firepower with the scary guy|and leave us to clean up the mess.
- You'd love an excuse to hurt him.
|- I don't need an excuse.
I think lots of dead people|actually constitutes a reason.
Right.
This is all nobility|and has nothing to do with jealousy.
Hello?
Miss Not Over Yourself Yet?
- Don't you start.
|- Giles, no one's doing the "I" statements.
That's enough.
Everybody.
Buffy knows our concerns, and her actions,|however ill-advised, can be understood.
Our priority right now is to retrieve|the Glove of Myhnegon and try to destroy it.
Now all of you, back to your classes.
Thanks for the bail in there.
I know this is a lot to absorb, but Angel|did find the glove, and that was a Be quiet.
I won't remind you that the fate|of the world often lies with the Slayer.
What would be the point?
Nor shall I remind you that you've|jeopardised the lives of all you hold dear by harbouring a known murderer.
But sadly I must remind you|that Angel tortured me.
For hours.
For pleasure.
You should have told me|he was alive.
You didn't.
You have no respect for me,|or the job I perform.
A word of advice?
Vampires rarely knock.
Especially in daylight.
Oh, right.
So, this is your home.
Yeah.
The decorator actually just left.
Faith, do you know who the Spartans were?
Wild stab, a bunch o' guys from Spart?
They were the fiercest warriors|known to ancient Greece.
And they lived in quarters very much|like these.
Do you know why?
Because a true fighter needs nothing else.
I'm going to be very hard on you, Faith.
I will not brook insolence or laziness.
And I will not allow blunders|like last night's attack.
You will probably hate me|a great deal of the time.
You think?
But I will make you a better slayer.
And that will keep you alive.
You have to trust that I am right.
God knows what Mr Giles|has been filling your head with.
Giles is OK.
His methods are unfathomable to me.
|I find him entirely confounding.
But that is not important.
Let him|have his games and secret meetings.
What meetings?
Oh, I don't know.
Something|with Buffy and her friends.
Oh.
Right.
I guess that doesn't include me.
And why does he let her socialise|so much?
It hardly seems No matter.
Would you like to do some training?
Training?
As in kicking,|punching and stabbing?
- Yes, that's the idea.
|- I'm your girl.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
So, on a scale of one to a million,|how much are you hating me right now?
Zero.
You were scared.
|You kept a secret, you know?
It's OK.
I mean, secrets aren't bad,|you know?
They're normal.
They're better than normal.
|They're good.
Secrets are good.
Must be a reason why we keep 'em, right?
Yeah, I guess.
So, are you goin' to the Bronze tonight?
Or are you gonna sneak away for|a not-so-secret rendezvous with Angel?
None of the above.
I'm gonna try and kill|this Lagos guy.
Peace offering to Giles.
Well, Angel has the glove now, right?
Yep.
But Lagos doesn't know that.
Sooner or later he'll show up|at that crypt looking for it.
Ah, but instead he finds|a Buffy in a not-so-good mood?
That's my brilliant plan.
You look pissed.
- Rough day.
|- Tell me about it.
Rather just shoot.
Don't think I don't know what you and your|pals were talking about behind my back.
Yeah?
What was that?
- More about this glove than you're saying.
|- The Glove of Myhnegon?
Right.
How'd you like some real news?
|Angel's still alive.
The vampire.
Back in town.
Saw him myself.
|Totin' the popular and famous glove.
Angel.
Guy like that, that kind of glove,|could kill a whole mess of people.
Said the same thing to Buffy myself.
|Weird how she didn't seem to care.
Buffy knew he was alive?
I can't believe her!
She says he's clean.
Yeah, well, I say we can't afford to find out.
|I say I deal with this problem right now.
I say I slay.
Can I come?
You wanted to see me, Mr Giles?
Yes.
I do apologise for|bringing you in at this late hour.
Please.
A good watcher must be|awake and alert at all hours.
Would you like some tea?
God, yes, please.
I'm completely knackered.
I spent|the afternoon training with Faith.
She doesn't lack for energy.
She's your first slayer, I take it?
If you're questioning my qualifications No, I'm not.
I have the utmost respect for your methods.
|In my own American way.
I also have the glove.
Not actually on me, but I believe it's safe.
It's in a mansion on Crawford Street.
|A friend of Buffy's is keeping it there.
Well, we must get to it.
Immediately.
- Hide it before someone else finds it.
|- Or, better still, destroy it.
- Destroy it?
|- Yes.
Yes, I didn't think|it could be done either, but It involves transforming fire|into Living Flame and immolating the glove.
It's complex, but I believe|I have all the necessary materials.
Well, I must say, Mr Giles, good show.
Good show indeed.
Not to downplay my own slaying abilities, which in some circles are considered|formidable, but shouldn't Faith be here?
I tried calling, but no one was home.
Look, if you're feeling any demon-o-phobia,|please, splitting is totally an option.
You're not the one in trouble with Giles.
That's true.
How long do you think|he can stay angry at me anyway?
The emotional Marathon Man?
Yeah.
I can't really blame him.
It's weird, though.
Now that my secret Angel, it's all out in the open I feel better.
Well, sure you do.
|This big burden's been lifted.
I mean, keeping secrets is a lot of work.
One could hypothetically imagine.
You have no idea.
None whatsoever.
But can I ask you a question?
When you were with Angel|and nobody knew about it, did that make it feel,|you know, sexier somehow?
Not really.
It's too much pressure.
After awhile it even makes|the fun parts not so fun.
What makes you think all this|secret stuff is sexy anyway?
Nothing.
Just wondering.
Gotta keep|askin' the big old questions when you're blessed with|this girl's thirst for knowledge.
OK, there's something I have to tell you.
What?
OK.
This will make me feel better, right?
You know, I always|consider myself a good person.
Floss, do my homework, never cheat But lately, and please don't judge me on this,|but I want you to be the first to know that that there's a demon behind you.
Now we're talkin'.
Yes.
Sorry about that.
So, what were you saying?
Oh, I I opened my SAT test booklet|five minutes early.
Just doesn't seem important now, does it?
Your secret's safe with me.
Come on, let's go bring|Giles some happiness.
Good old Sunnydale library, fully equipped|with reference books, file cards and weapons.
I call crossbow.
You got it.
- All right, ready to go?
|- That I am.
- Wait.
|- What?
Oh, my God, it's Giles.
Giles, can you hear me?
- What the hell happened?
|- Let me guess.
Stop.
Hold.
Just think a minute.
- Yeah, I'm thinking: Buffy's ex-meat did this.
|- It's not Angel's style.
- He's a demon.
How much proof d'you need?
|- Bite marks would be nice.
Yeah, I have medical emergency.
|Sunnydale High.
- Screw this waiting crap.
|- Faith, if we leave, Giles could die.
He's gonna have a lot of company|unless I do something.
- Wait.
|- For what?
You to grow a pair?
You handle the baby-sit and I'll kill Angel.
Dammit!
Exorere, Flamma Vitae, Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum, in hunc mundum vivorum, Exorere, Flamma Vitae, Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum,|in hunc mundum vivorum, Giles is gonna be psyched|that we showed up stuffy old Mrs Post.
Oh, my God.
What happened?
Caucasian male, mid-forties, head trauma.
|Notify ER, we're bringing him in.
- What happened?
|- No time for this.
Wait.
Buffy, you must destroy the glove.
You want him to live?
Get out of the way.
Use Living Flame.
Move.
What happened?
Your boyfriend's not as cured as you thought.
- What makes you think Angel did this?
|- We saw what you saw.
- So you just assume?
|- I didn't.
Faith did.
- What did you tell her?
|- Only what everyone knows.
She's a big girl.
|Came to her own conclusions.
How much of a head start does she have?
Ten minutes.
Go through Giles' research.
|Figure out how to destroy the glove.
Shut up and help me.
- What do you want?
|- Gwen Post.
Mr Giles sent me.
What for?
To help you destroy the glove.
|Is that the Living Flame?
Yes.
Look, I'm sorry to be so abrupt,|but Lagos is on his way here now.
If you're performing the ritual incorrectly,|it will only make the glove more powerful.
All right.
Good.
Where is the glove?
It's in the trunk.
That's what I love about this town.
|Everyone's so helpful.
Bugger!
Bugger!
OK.
That hurt.
It was supposed to kill you.
If you'd been human, it would have.
But I believe this is your poison.
Mrs Post!
I can't believe how much I'm gonna kill you!
- You're not gettin' that glove.
|- Wanna bet?
What?
Think we got it?
Well, it's either the catalyst for Living Flame|or just some really smelly sand.
- We'll have to test this.
|- I'll double-check.
- What?
|- I know what the glove does.
There's no time to test this.
- I can't let you do it, Faith.
|- You're confused, twinkie.
Let me clear you up:|vampire, Slayer, dead vampire.
There's a lot that you don't understand.
Faith?
She doesn't know.
|She's blinded by love.
- Faith, no.
|- Trust me.
We can figure this out.
The glove.
It's in the trunk.
- I'll get it.
|- Help Faith.
What are you?
Stop.
Guys, listen.
Finally.
Tar chugam a chumhacht Myhnegon!
What's going on?
Faith, a word of advice.
You're an idiot.
Tar frim!
Tar frim!
Tar frim!
Can you draw her fire?
- You bet I can.
|- Go do it.
Tar frim!
There's nothing you can do to me now.
|I have the glove.
- With the glove comes the power.
|- I'm getting that.
So there's no more glove thingy?
Well, a little Living Flame,|a little mesquite, gone for good.
- Sounds like we missed a lotta fun.
|- Then we're telling it wrong.
What do you think Buffy and Angel will do?
Boy, do I don't know.
Well, he saved me from a horrible flamey|death - that sort of makes me like him again.
Well, as long as she and Angel|don't get pelvic, we'll be OK, I guess.
- What are you guys talkin' about?
|- Oddly enough, your boyfriend.
Again.
He's not my boyfriend.
Really, truly.
He's I don't know.
Are we cool?
Yeah.
Just seein' the two of you kissing|after everything that happened, I leaned toward the postal.
- But I trust you.
|- I don't.
Just for the record.
Let me guess.
|Gwendolyn Post, not a watcher?
Yes, she was.
She was kicked out|by the Council a couple of years ago for misuses of dark power.
They swear there was a memo.
Well, I'd better go.
|Little more damage control.
The whole Angel thing is so weird.
Yes, well, we'll have to see|how that unfolds, won't we?
Come in.
Hey.
- The place looks nice.
|- Yeah, it's real Spartan.
How are you?
Five-by-five.
I'll interpret that as good.
Look, Gwendolyn Post, or whoever|she may be, had us all fooled.
Even Giles.
Yeah.
Well, you can't trust people.
|I should've learned that by now.
I realise this will sound funny coming from someone that just spent|a lot of time kicking your face, but you can trust me.
- Is that right?
|- I know I kept secrets.
I didn't have a choice.
- I'm on your side.
|- I'm on my side.
And that's enough.
Not always.
Is that it?
- Yeah, I guess.
|- All right.
Well, then I'll see ya.
Buffy?
Yeah?
Nothing.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
This is a nightmare.
My world is spinning.
- It's not that bad, Willow.
Really.
|- 140, verbal?
I'm pathetic.
Illiterate.
I'm Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel.
And the fact that your 140, verbal,|resembles my combined score in no way compromises|your position as the village idiot.
I just Where did I go wrong?
You did amazing, Willow.
As usual.
- You guys get your scores?
|- Cordelia!
Willow was very sad about her|academic failure.
How did you do?
- This is not good.
|- What's not good?
It may hurt my standing as campus stud|when people find out I'm dating a brain.
Please.
I have some experience|in covering these things up.
I can see why you'd be upset.
That was my sarcastic voice.
- It sounds like your regular voice.
|- I've been told that.
- We should celebrate.
|- Like, the four of us?
A double date.
It could have potential.
Buffy, hey!
Did you get your SAT scores?
By the look on your face, I guess we'll be|manning the drive-thru window side by side.
They're just test scores, right?
|What do they really mean, anyway?
OK, so academic achievement|gets me a little excited.
- Buff, that's amazing.
|- Let me see that.
With those scores you can apply anywhere.
Buffy, this could change your whole future.
- The thought had occurred to me.
|- Then why the sour puss?
I don't know.
I guess my future I never thought about it.
|I wasn't even sure I'd have one.
I think this is great.
Now you can|leave and never come back.
I mean it in a positive way.
Get out|of Sunnydale.
It's a good thing.
What kind of moron would|want to come back here?
Home sweet home.
# And more, much more than this # I did it my way Drusilla!
I'm home!
Why did you do it, baby?
|Why did you leave me?
We were happy here.
You stupid, worthless bitch!
Look what you've done to me.
Come on.
It'll be fun.
I don't know.
I thought we were gonna|do something, you know classy?
What's classier than bowling?
Apart from everything ever?
Let's see.
Oz and Willow are down.
|You're the swing vote.
I guarantee fun.
- Hey, those are from the pier.
|- Yeah.
I just got 'em developed.
There's pictures.
Of me.
In your locker.
I never knew I was locker-door material.
Well, just barely.
Besides, I look|really cute in those pictures.
Hey, so what's the verdict?
Do we bowl?
- We bowl.
|- Great.
Bowling date.
I'm on Oz's team.
Yeah?
Well, prepare to be crushed.
Maybe we should practise.
They don't stand a chance.
I'm really good.
Or I used to be, when they had|the inflatable things in the gutters.
- What's this?
|- It's a gift.
- What's the occasion?
|- Pretty much you are.
- It's a little Pez witch!
|- It's kind of a theme present.
- Do you like it?
|- I like I more than like.
Oz, this is probably the sweetest We have to find a little Pez werewolf,|so little Pez witch can have a boyfriend.
I don't think they make a werewolf Pez.
We|might have to settle for a wacky cartoon dog.
This is just so thoughtful.
Well, I think about you.
Oh, I don't have anything to give you.
Yeah, you do.
Buffy, this is remarkable.
So is this.
Where is this|retreat thingy?
The Yukon?
It's quite nearby.
It's a clearing|at the top of Breakers Woods.
It's the site of some|fascinating druidic rituals.
But you're just going for a few days, right?
You're not gonna settle there|and grow crops or anything?
What?
Oh, my gear?
No, no, no,|this is basic necessities.
Giles.
You pack like me.
Here.
I suspect your mother will|want to put it on the refrigerator.
Yeah.
She saw these scores and|her head spun around and exploded.
I've been on the Hellmouth too long.
- That was metaphorical, yes?
|- Yes.
She was happy.
She started with all this crazy talk|about me going to college.
Maybe someplace else.
I know.
I said you were gonna have a goat.
|Responsibilities.
I know the drill.
- She may be right.
|- Yeah, no, I figured you OK.
Be kind.
Rewind.
With scores like these, Buffy,|you could have a first-rate education.
I'm not suggesting that|you ignore your calling, but you need to look to your future.
And with Faith here,|it may be that you can move on.
For a time, at least.
Wow.
Well, let's discuss it when I get back.
In the meantime, I'd like you|to continue training.
And please don't do anything rash.
"Anything rash" meaning?
Are you planning on seeing Angel?
Yes, actually.
I am.
Look, but there's not|gonna be any rash.
Anywhere.
OK, we're friends.
|That's all either of us wants.
Nothing's gonna happen.
- Something's gonna happen.
|- Like what?
It's a mistake.
It's a terrible, fatal mistake.
- I see that now.
|- It's just bowling.
It's bad bowling.
It's a double date.
|With all of us.
They're gonna know.
- How are they gonna know?
|- It's a very intimate situation.
It's all sexy with the smoke|and sweating and shoe rental.
- You're turned on by rented shoes?
|- That's not the issue.
Let me ask you this.
What are they|gonna know?
That we're friends.
Old friends.
Maybe we've had|one or two indiscretions, but that's past.
Look, we're just very good friends who like|to hang out.
And can I kiss your ear lobe?
No.
Well, OK.
No.
Pez.
Maybe bowling might be|too much to handle.
Man!
I wish I wasn't so attracted to you.
|I wish we could make it all stop.
Any suggestions?
Carnegie Mellon has|a wonderful design curriculum.
And Brown University's history programme|is You like history, right?
Could we talk about this another time?
|All day it's been "Congratulations!
Go away".
That's not it.
It's just You belong at a good old-fashioned college|with keg parties and boys.
Not here with hellmouths and vampires.
Not really seeing the distinction.
You always talk about how you wish you|could lead a normal life.
This is your chance.
Yeah, it's just not that simple.
|I have responsibilities.
I know, but I spoke with|Mr Giles and he said That Faith can be Miss Sunnydale|in the Slayer Pageant.
I know.
It's time to think about your future,|Buffy.
About your whole life.
I mean, is there anything keeping you here?
Yeah, you.
You think I'm afraid of you?
We were happy.
You brainwashed her.
I could just Yeah, I'll show you who's a cool guy.
You're goin' down.
This is just too much.
Did you come in through the back?
Yeah.
I need a curse.
A what?
A curse.
You know, something nasty.
Boils.
I want to give him boils.
All over his face.
You know, dripping|pustules.
Really go for the gusto here.
I'm hearing a lot of negative energy, and Leprosy.
I want a spell|that makes his parts fall off.
We don't carry leprosy.
Would you excuse me a moment?
Blessed be.
Anything|in particular I can help you find?
Yeah.
It's all here on the list:|essence of rose thorn, canary feathers A love spell.
Want that old lover|to come back to you?
- Are you sure you know what you're doing?
|- No.
I mean, yes.
I know how to do a love spell,|but this is more of an anti-love spell.
Yeah.
Kind of a de-lusting.
The supplies are basically the same, right?
Basically.
Although raven feathers tend to|breed a little more discontent than canary.
Let me just get some things.
That'll be $15.80 for the lot.
Thanks.
So, did you find a spell book?
Forget the book.
I just got a better idea.
Oh, look at that.
Every time.
Cuts to the left.
And it's not the carpet.
It's me.
I swear, I would sell my soul|for a decent short game.
Of course, it's a little late for that.
I don't suppose I could offer your soul?
|It would really help me on the green.
I'm just funnin'.
So, we have|a Spike problem, do we?
He's been spotted back in town and there was|an incident at a magic shop in broad daylight.
- The police had a helluva time covering it up.
|- Well, yes.
He was up to all sorts|of shenanigans last year.
We had a world of fun|trying to guess what he'd do next.
I remember.
But I guess we're past that now.
This year is too important to let|a loose cannon rock the boat.
Should I have Mr Trick send a|committee to deal with this?
"Loose cannon rock the boat".
|Is that a mixed metaphor?
Boats did have cannons.
|And a loose one would cause it to rock.
Honestly.
I don't know where|my mind goes these days.
Why don't you take care of that Spike|problem?
A committee, like you said.
- As good as done.
|- That's swell.
Fore!
- College, huh?
|- Higher education.
Kind of an intense proposition.
Where do you wanna go?
I have no idea.
My mom|is the one that got all these.
She's so excited, she|can't stop talking about it.
I had a really hard time coming up|with an alibi so I could come over here.
- She doesn't know about me?
|- Big "no".
She's having enough trouble|with the slayer issue.
I don't think she's ready to|process the information that you and I are friends again.
Anyway, I think this college jones|is just a reaction to the slayer thing.
- She wants you to get out.
|- Someplace a little less hellmouthy.
She has a point.
You know?
|But there are reasons to stay too.
What are they?
Oh, and there's my slayer duties, obviously.
What do you think I should do?
As a friend?
I think that you should leave.
And this is a good opportunity for you.
Yeah.
It's not like there's|any great thing keeping me here.
Thanks for the advice.
It's|another perspective to consider.
Where are you goin'?
|You just got here.
It's early.
Yeah, well, my mom starts worrying|a lot earlier these days.
I'll stop by soon.
Whoa!
It smells like church in here.
No, wait.
Evil church.
It's just chemistry stuff.
An experiment.
So you said when you called.
|Why do I have to be here?
It'll help you on the exam.
|You're way behind.
But that's why you love me, right?
|Academically dangerous.
Here, hold this.
A feather?
And who will I be tickling?
OK.
Bring mixture to a boil.
I assume this won't make us late|for our evening of bowling magic?
There's no magic!
I mean bowling, yeah.
Cordelia and Oz are gonna meet us here later.
Can we turn these lights on?
- Is that a spell book?
|- No, no, no.
Chemistry book.
Wait a minute.
This is love-spell stuff.
|You're doin' a love spell?
No, of course not!
This is a purely scientific de-lusting spell.
For us.
I thought it would|go better if you didn't know.
Are you nuts?
Have you forgotten that|I tend to have bad luck with these spells?
But you said you wished|these feelings could go away.
I wished I was a fireman when we were kids,|but you didn't follow through on that.
I can't do this any more, Xander.
|This whole "us" thing is Do you need to resort to the black arts|to keep our hormones in check?
At this point, I'm thinking no.
I'll get the lights.
Clean this place up before|they get here and start asking questions.
Xander!
I need to borrow the little girl.
You don't mind, do you?
Threatening me?
That's not nice.
We're all gonna be very best friends.
Xander!
A spell.
For me.
- You're gonna do a spell for me.
|- What kind of spell?
A love spell.
Are you brain dead?
I'm gonna get what's mine.
What's mine.
I'll teach her to walk out on me.
- What are you starin' at?
|- Nothin'.
You can do it, right?
You can make Dru love me|again.
Make her crawl.
- I can try.
|- What are you talking about, trying?
- You'll do it.
|- Yes, I'll do it.
You lie to me and I'll shove this through|your face.
Right through to your brain!
No, please, no.
She wouldn't even kill me.
She just left.
She didn't even care enough to|cut off my head, or set me on fire.
Is that too much to ask?
You know?
Some little sign that she cared?
It was that truce with Buffy that did it.
Dru said I'd gone soft.
Wasn't "demon" enough for the likes of her.
I told her it didn't mean anything.
I was|thinkin' of her the whole time.
She didn't care.
So, we got to Brazil and she was she was just different.
I gave her everything.
Beautiful jewels,|beautiful dresses with beautiful girls in them.
But nothin' made her happy.
And she would flirt.
I caught her on a bench,|makin' outwith the chaos demon.
Have you ever seen a chaos demon?
They're all slime and antlers.
|They're disgusting.
She only did it to hurt me.
So I said "I am not|putting up with this any more".
And she said "Fine".
And I said "I've got an un-life, you know"?
|And she said she said we could still be friends.
God, I'm so unhappy.
- There, there.
|- I mean, friends.
How could she be so cruel?
That smell.
Your neck.
I haven't had a woman in weeks.
No!
No!
Hold it.
- Well, unless you count that shopkeeper.
|- No.
No, hold on.
I'll do your spell for you|and I'll get you Drusilla back, but there will be no "bottle in face" and|there will be no "having" of any kind with me.
All right?
All right.
Get started.
Now, I'm not a real witch, you know.
I don't know if this is gonna work right away.
Well, if at first you don't succeed, I'll kill him and you try again.
This isn't enough.
- What?
|- Well, there are other ingredients.
And a book.
I need a spell book.
This isn't it.
You've got it, though.
At home?
Not at home.
I left it somewhere.
Where?
- Thank God.
You are here.
|- Not all of us have dates tonight.
Something's up.
We were supposed to meet in here.
|I don't know what could have happened.
What is all this stuff?
|I'm thinking Weird Science, Was Willow messing with her magic|again?
Maybe they disappeared.
Maybe she turned Xander|into something ishy.
- There was obviously a fight.
|- I don't see any blood.
Yeah, either they were taken or they ran or - You're having too many "or"s.
Pick one.
|- I don't know.
I need you to find Giles.
I'm gonna look for them.
- Where is Giles?
|- He's at a retreat in Breakers Woods.
- I know the spot.
But it's a 45-minute drive.
|- So motor.
- Giles?
|- Are you still working out?
No, Mom.
Actually I was hoping that we could schedule|a college talk later tonight, I admit I overreacted before.
You don't have to go across the county.
|I picked up brochures from nearby schools.
- That's great, Mom, but now's really not|- Hello, Joyce.
So I'm strolling through the park looking|for a meal, and I happen to walk by, and she's making out with the chaos demon.
So I said "You know, I don't|have to put up with this".
And she said "Fine".
So I said|"Fine, do whatever you like".
I mean, I thought we were gonna make up.
Well, she sounds very unreasonable.
She is.
She's out of her mind.
That's what I miss most about her.
Sometimes, even when two people|seem right for each other, their lives take different paths.
|Like when Buffy's father and I This is different.
Our love|was eternal - literally.
You got any of those little marshmallows?
Let me look.
- Spike.
|- Oh, my God.
Get out of here.
Yeah.
You're not invited.
- He'll kill us.
|- Not while I breathe.
Actually, I don't.
- Joyce, listen to me.
|- Get out of this house or I will stake you.
You're a very bad man.
Joyce, you can't trust him.
Invite me in.
- I'll cut your head off.
|- You and what army?
That would be me.
Angel, why don't you come on in?
Oh, no.
- You shouldn't have come back.
|- I do what I please.
OK, I'm confused again.
Willow!
- You took Willow.
|- You do me now, you'll never find the witch.
- Willow's a witch?
|- And Xander?
- Him too.
|- Xander's a witch?
Where are they?
It doesn't work like that, peaches.
When did you become soul-having?
|I thought you outgrew that.
Your friend will work magic for me.
|When she does my spell, I'll let them go.
- You're not famous for keeping promises.
|- You and your poof want to tag along, fine.
But you get in my way,|and you kill your friends.
What if they were kidnapped by drug lords?
|They could be cutting off Xander's ear now.
Or other parts.
Hello?
It's Willow.
She's nearby.
What?
You can smell her?
|She doesn't even wear perfume.
She's afraid.
Oh, my God.
Is this some sort of residual|werewolf thing?
This is very disturbing.
I really agree.
I just need a few supplies|and then I'll take you to - What's wrong?
Not that I care.
|- My head.
I think I'm soberin' up.
It's horrible.
Oh, God.
I wish I was dead.
If you close your eyes and wish hard Buffy, we still need him to find the others.
Need him?
He's probably just|got 'em locked up in the factory.
Hey, how thick do you think I am?
Fine.
Could we just get this over with?
- Oh, God.
|- Now what?
We killed a homeless man on this bench.
Me and Dru.
Those were good times.
You know, he begged for mercy|and that only made her bite harder.
I guess you had to be there.
Your work?
Here's a list.
Essence of violet, cloves.
Angel?
Right.
A set of runic tablets.
Spike can get the rat's eyes.
I used to bring her rats.
- With the morning paper.
|- More moping.
That's gonna get her back.
The spell's gonna get her back.
- Lotta trouble for someone who doesn't care.
|- Shut your gob.
- She really is just kind of fickle.
|- Shut up!
What do you know?
|It's your fault, the both of you!
She belongs with me.
I'm nothing without her.
That I'll have to agree with.
You're pathetic.
You're not even a loser.
|You're a shell of a loser.
Yeah?
You're one to talk.
Meaning?
The last time I looked in on you two,|you were fightin' to the death.
Now you're back making eyes|at each other like nothin' happened.
- Makes me want to heave.
|- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, yeah.
You're just "friends".
|- That's right.
You're not friends.
You'll never be friends.
You'll be in love till it kills you both.
You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll|hate each other till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends.
Love isn't brains, children.
It's blood.
|Blood screamin' inside you to work its will.
I may be love's bitch, but at least|I'm man enough to admit it.
Eye of rat.
Xander?
Are you OK?
Dizzy.
Kinda nauseous too.
- Do I remember having a fight with Spike?
|- You do.
I won, right?
- Kicked his ass?
|- You were real brave.
- Do you need to barf?
|- No, I'll be OK.
- Where are we?
|- The factory.
We're locked in the basement.
That burnt-out place|in the middle of nowhere?
- So we're in a scream-all-you-want scenario?
|- Pretty much.
- Why didn't he just kill us?
|- He wants me to do a love spell.
- What?
|- Drusilla broke up with him.
Gee, and we'd all hoped those|crazy kids would make it work.
He's out of control.
I mean, not that|he was Joe Restraint in the old days.
So what are our options?
Well, I figure either I refuse|to do the spell and he kills us, or I do the spell and he kills us.
Give me a third option.
He's so drunk he forgets about us and we|starve to death.
That's sort of the best one.
Will, we're not gonna die.
If he's so drunk, he'll get sloppy,|and then I'll make my move.
As long as my move doesn't involve|standing up or using my limbs, we'll be OK.
We're not supposed to.
Exemption for impending-death situation.
Oh, God.
- Oh, God.
|- Oh, God.
Oz.
We have to get outta here.
Cordy, I Cordelia!
I fell.
- OK, we got the stuff.
Where are they?
|- What's your hurry?
My hurry is my intense desire to get you|out of my life.
You cause trouble.
I'll be out of your life|in a few hours.
No trouble at all.
Hello, Spike.
No trouble at all.
Lenny.
How have you been?
Better, since you left.
|You should've stayed gone.
- Is that right?
|- He was just leaving.
- Don't you start anything.
|- This pissant used to work for me.
- We can't risk this.
|- We don't have a choice.
You other two can walk away from this.
I die, your chums die.
Sorry, we're staying.
Not for long.
Go!
This should be a kick.
I violently dislike you.
- Be careful.
|- Yeah.
Don't move, Cordy.
Oz went to get help.
- We need to get outta here.
|- Can we get to the roof?
Yeah, I heard you'd gone soft.
|Sad to see it, man.
- Soft?
|- Yeah, like baby food.
Well, then.
Let's give baby a taste.
- I'm all right.
|- You're not up to your full strength.
That window's about to go.
Buffy.
Baby like his supper?
|Baby like his supper?
Why doesn't baby have a nap?
Spike, get down!
Now, that was fun.
Don't tell me that wasn't fun?
Oh, God.
It's been so long since|I had a decent spot of violence.
It really puts things in perspective.
Oh, yeah.
You two.
|Just friends.
No danger there.
- Could we just do the damn spell now?
|- Sod that.
Your friends are at the factory.
I'm really glad I came here, you know?
I've been all wrong-headed about this.
|Weepin', crawlin', blamin' everybody else.
I want Dru back, I've just got to be|the man I was.
The man she loved.
I'll do what I should have done in|the first place.
Find her, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her, till she likes me again.
Love's a funny thing.
Cordy?
Please hold on.
Xander?
I can't see you.
Cordy?
He created all things|in order that they might exist.
The generative forces|of this world are wholesome.
And there is no destructive poison in them.
|For the dominion of Hades is not on earth.
For righteousness is immortal.
So, Cordelia's gonna be OK?
She lost a lot of blood.
|None of her vitals were punctured.
Has she talked to Xander yet?
She wasn't allowed to have visitors|at first.
He's going to see her today.
And Oz?
I never knew there was anything|inside me that could feel this bad.
For the longest time,|I didn't know what I wanted.
I wanted everything.
And now I just I just want him to talk to me again.
Just give it some time.
And be prepared for some grovelling.
Oh, I'm ready.
I'm all over grovelling.
Good.
See, now, I hear sometimes it works.
Can I come in?
They wouldn't let me see you until now.
Those are flowers.
- Look, Cordy, I want you to know that|- Xander?
Yeah.
Stay away from me.
I was wonderin' when you were comin'.
I'm not coming back.
We're not friends.
We never were.
And I can fool Giles.
And I can fool my friends.
But I can't fool myself.
Or Spike, for some reason.
What I want from you, I can never have.
You don't need me|to take care of you any more.
- So I'm gonna go.
|- I don't accept that.
- You have to.
|- Look.
There's gotta be some way|we can still see each other.
There is.
Tell me that you don't love me.
# Each careful step # Along the highway # And more, much more than this # I did it my way!

Nerf!
Nerf!
Nerf!
Oh, God!
Demon!
Demon!
|What kills a demon?
Nerf!
Nerf!
Oh, "nerf'.
Not "nerf'.
Knife!
.
OK.
That was too close for comfort.
Not that slaying is ever comfy,|but you know what I mean.
- If you guys hadn't been here to help|- But we were, and we did, and we're all fine.
- Isn't he gonna go poof?
|- I guess these guys don't.
We have to bury him or something.
Makes you appreciate vamps, though.
|No fuss, no muss.
How come Faith was a no-show?
I thought|mucousy demons were her favourites.
Couldn't reach her again.
She hasn't been hanging out much.
I detect worry.
A little bit.
Slaying's a rough gig.
|Too much alone time isn't healthy.
- Stuff gets pent up.
|- We should do more socialising with her.
Well, burial detail aside,|does this cap us off for the day?
You got plans?
I cannot stress enough|how much I don't have plans.
No luck reaching Cordelia?
I've left a few messages.
60, 70 But you know what really bugs me?
|OK, we kissed.
It was a mistake.
- But I know that was our last ever kiss.
|- Darn tootin'.
And they burst in, rescuing us,|without even knocking?
I mean, this is really all their fault.
Your logic does not resemble our Earth logic.
- Mine is much more advanced.
|- At least tomorrow's Monday.
- Another school day.
|- That's good.
Now focus on school.
That's the strong Willow way to heal.
Actually I was thinking Oz will be there|and I can beg for forgiveness.
- That works too.
|- I wanna be strong Willow.
But then I think I may never|get to be close to Oz again and it's like all the air|just goes out of the room.
- I know the feeling.
|- Right.
You went through it with Angel|and you're still standing.
So tell us, wise one, how do you deal?
I have you guys.
Hey, it's Xander, If you get this, call me, Hi,Xander, I, uh,,, Well, I'm in if you feel like talking, Bye, Hi, Cordelia, Um,,, If you get the chance,,,|If we can talk, I'm here, Hey again, It's me, I'm here,,, again, - How's it goin'?
|- Oz hasn't been to his locker.
There may be books in there that|he needs, but still he doesn't come.
- Has Xander seen Cordelia?
|- I don't think so.
But she is coming in today.
|Amy saw her last night at the mall.
How is she?
I don't know.
Amy said|she looked pretty scary.
Cordelia.
You look amazing.
Oh.
You have to meet Anya.
|She just moved here.
And her dad just bought What was it?
Oh, a utility or something.
- Nice bag.
Prada?
|- Good call.
Most people around here|can't tell Prada from Payless.
God, Cordy, when I heard about|Well, I mean, I couldn't believe it.
But it was smart, you know,|the "injury" thing?
You take a week off, let everybody forget the|temporary insanity that was Xander Harris.
Xander who?
You know what you have to do.
Start dating.
Get back on the horse.
Oh, absolutely.
I am ready to ride.
Then I have just the stallion.
He's so you.
I'm pretty sure he won't cheat on you,|at least not for a while.
Plus, he's got a killer moped.
Oz.
Wow.
Look at us.
Running into each other, as two people|who go to the same school are so likely to do now and then.
Hey.
Oz, wait.
Please.
What I did When I think that I hurt you Yeah.
You said all this stuff already.
Right.
But I want to make it up to you.
I mean, if you'll let me, I want to try.
Just You can leave me alone.
- I need to figure things out.
|- But maybe if we talk about it, we could Look, I'm sorry this is hard for you.
But I told you what I need.
So I can't help feeling like|the reason you wanna talk is so you can feel better about yourself.
That's not my problem.
Hey, John Lee.
Do I have|something caught in my teeth?
So what's new?
God,|it's been, like, a gazillion years.
Look, the guys are kinda down on me.
|Coach just cut me back to second string.
If anyone saw me hanging with|Xander Harris's castoff on top of that Death, you know?
But maybe, if you wanna go someplace private - What?
|- Think about it.
- Hey.
|- Go ahead.
Dazzle me with your oh-so-brilliant insult.
|Just join the club.
Hardly.
Actually, I've been looking for you.
|Ever since we met, I was like "Thank God there's one other|person in town who reads W," - But Harmony?
|- Oh, she follows me around.
If that girl had an original thought,|her head would explode.
Is that Gucci?
No.
It's an actual old thing, sort of|a good luck charm my dad gave me.
Too bad I didn't have|one of those pre-Xander.
- Can I just say Men.
|- Seconded.
Apart from being without class, the guy's|obviously blind.
Deserves whatever he gets.
I'm not even thinking about him.
|I am past it.
I am living my life.
- Still, I mean, don't you kinda wish|- I don't wish.
I act.
Starting now, Xander Harris is gonna|get a bellyful of just how over him I am.
Excuse me.
I need to be both|giving and receiving of mirth.
Is it too much to ask for a little backup?
I'm here for you, Xand.
I'm support-o-gal.
I just feel a little weird about this|"us against Cordelia" thing.
She's had a rough time.
It's true.
Cordelia belongs|to the "justified" camp.
She should make us pay.
|And pay and pay and pay - In fact, there's not enough "pay" for|- Look.
You wanna do guilt-a-palooza, fine.
I'm done with that.
I'm gonna grab ahold|of that crazy little thing called life and let it do its magical little healie thing.
What's done is done.
Let's be in the moment,|behold the beauty that is now.
Who's with me?
Actually, you're making sense.
|We're young and free in America.
How dare we be spun by love,|or the lack of same?
Absolutely.
It's self-indulgent.
I'm in.
I'm on the joy train.
That didn't work.
|Who wants chocolate?
I'm up.
Look at her.
Tears of a clown, baby.
Or is it "grins of a sad person"?
|Or maybe it's - Xander, your hand.
|- Oops.
Sorry.
But why "oops"?
I mean, we always touch digits.
|It's a friend thing.
Comfort.
Like chocolate.
Maybe it used to be.
But since we It's different.
I'm sorry.
But if I want|to make things right with Oz, my hands, my All my stuff has to be for him only.
Hey, Cordelia.
Wait a second.
Did Xander send you to beg for him?
- Because if he did|- No.
I'm a free agent, I promise.
- I just wanted to see how you are.
|- Never been better.
Cordelia, I know what it's like|to be hurt by someone.
Hurt so much you don't think you're gonna|make it.
But I told my friends how I felt.
And you know what?
They got a little better.
Cordelia, look out.
You know what I've been asking|myself a lot this last week?
Why me?
Why do I get impaled?
Why do I get bitten by snakes?
|Why do I fall for incredible losers?
And you know, I think|I've finally figured it out.
What my problem is?
It's Buffy Summers.
That's when all|my troubles started.
When she moved here.
- Are you OK?
|- I just pulled some stitches last night.
Know why?
Surprise!
It was Buffy's fault.
Oh, hey.
It's Garbage Girl.
Loved the look last night, Cor.
|Dumpster chic for the dumped.
Here.
I think you need this|more than I do right now.
Yeah, I could use some luck.
|And a stick with pointy sharp bits.
- If that Buffy wasn't I swear|- She's a pain.
But Xander He's an utter loser.
Don't you wish I never would have looked twice at Xander|if Buffy hadn't made him marginally cooler.
- Really?
|- Yeah.
I swear.
I wish Buffy Summers|had never come to Sunnydale.
Done.
Anya?
"I wish Buffy Summers|had never come to Sunnydale".
She was, like, a good fairy.
A scary, veiny, good fairy.
Where have you been?
Ted Sherborn just totally went for third|with Ginger, in front of everybody.
Love the dress.
It's so daring.
- Cordelia.
|- Yes?
Look, every guy on campus|has probably asked, but if you're not going to the Winter Brunch,|I'd be honoured, and we'd have fun.
- I'll get back to you.
|- Really?
- Yeah.
|- Great.
Cordy, you reign.
I do?
I mean, I do.
So what's with the Winter Brunch thing?
All right.
Now, don't forget.
|Tomorrow we have our monthly memorial, so there's no class.
- What's the rush?
|- Oh, my mom hates it when I'm late.
Since when?
Aren't we going out tonight?
- Curfew starts in an hour.
|- Curfew?
Come on.
I'm in a really good mood.
|Let's go to the Bronze.
Is that a joke?
Oh.
The Bronze isn't cool in this reality.
|I've gotta make these little adjustments.
Cordy, what's with you?
You wear this "come bite me" outfit,|you make jokes about the Bronze - You're acting a little schizo.
|- You're right.
I just Well, I bumped my head yesterday|and I keep forgetting stuff.
Not that I care, but Xander Harris,|he's miserable, right?
And that Willow freak.
Not even a blip on the radar screen, right?
Well, yeah.
They're dead.
OK.
Not funny!
Hey!
You!
Where did you put my car?
- Pardon?
|- My auto.
- El convertablo?
|- You students aren't allowed to drive.
- What?
|- Go on.
You better get in before the sun sets.
Well, whaddaya know?
Cordelia Chase.
What is this, some kind of sick joke?
|Harmony told me you were dead.
Now why would she say something like that?
Let's think.
Listen to me.
We have to find Buffy.
|She'll figure out a way to save us.
She was supposed to be here, and|as much as it kills me to admit it, things were better when she was around.
Buffy?
The Slayer?
No.
Buffy the dog-faced girl.
Duh!
Who do you think I'm talking about?
Bored now.
This is the part that's less fun,|when there isn't any screaming.
What's up with you two in the leather?
Play now?
It's not that I don't|appreciate your appetite, Will.
- But I thought we agreed it was my turn.
|- No.
No!
No way!
I wish us into bizarro-land,|and you guys are still together?
- I cannot win!
|- Probably not.
But I'll give you a head start.
I love this part.
You love all the parts.
No fun.
She didn't even hardly fight.
Oh, swell.
It's the white hats.
I've got them.
Get the girl.
- How's she doing?
|- Her pulse is strong.
Why was she wearing that?
Everyone knows|vampires are attracted to bright colours.
That's Cordelia.
It's better|to look good than to feel alive.
Go and watch the perimeters|in case they follow.
You're mine pretty soon, boy.
Slap my hand, dead soul man.
Ah.
Xander.
Willow.
Hungry?
I've lost my appetite for this one.
She keeps looking at me.
I'm trying to eat and she looks at me.
Go on.
I remember that lust for the kill.
Now, what news on the Rialto?
Had a prime kill.
Old crush, actually.
- Until that wanna-slay librarian showed up.
|- He'll be dealt with soon enough.
Weird thing.
The girl kept talkin' about Buffy.
"We gotta get Buffy here".
Isn't that what they called the Slayer?
Buffy.
Ooh, scary.
Someone has to talk to her people.
|That name is striking fear in nobody's hearts.
She talked of summoning a slayer here?
Now, at this time?
- And you didn't kill her?
|- Well, they had crosses.
The plant begins operation|in less than 24 hours.
You will find this girl.
You will kill her|before she contacts the Slayer, or I'll see you two kissing daylight.
Giles.
It's all my fault.
|I made this stupid wish - Come on, lie|- No!
You have to get Buffy.
Buffy changes it.
It wasn't like this.
It was better.
|I mean, the clothes alone.
But people were happy, mostly, and Wait.
Why are you here, and she's not?
- I mean, you were her watcher.
|- How do you know I was a watcher?
I've never What?
- What?
|- I thought I heard something.
Now, I want you to start again|and explain everything very carefully.
You're in a big cage.
Not too bright, book guy.
So you're a watcher?
Watch this.
- They hit us right outside.
|- Nancy?
She's dead.
Would you mind Could you take her to the incinerator?
|I have some business to Wait a moment.
- The deed is done.
|- You killed the girl who sought the Slayer?
- It was too easy.
|- I felt cheap.
Excellent.
The opening|will commence as scheduled.
So you're pleased?
Ecstatic.
Then can I play with the puppy?
Be my guest.
Yes, I understand, but|it's imperative that I see her.
Here.
Well, when will you?
Well, you are her watcher.
I'd expect|her to at least check in to Yes, I'm aware there's a great deal|of demonic activity in Cleveland.
It happens, you know,|that Sunnydale is on a Hellmouth.
It is so.
Well, just give her the message, if you ever see her again.
Bored now.
Daytime is the worst.
Cooped up for hours.
Can't hunt.
But the Master said I could play.
Isn't that fun, puppy?
Aw.
Puppy's bein' all quiet.
Come on.
Don't be a spoilsport.
Guess what today is.
Today the plant opens.
It's a big party.
You remember I told you about the plant.
All those people you tried to save It's gonna be quick for them.
Not for you, though.
It's gonna be slow for you.
That's right, puppy.
Willow's gonna make you bark.
Maybe I went too hard on you last time.
Too hard?
No such thing.
Watch it with those things.
|You almost got my hair.
Sorry.
I got carried away.
- Don't you want to?
|- No, thanks, baby.
I just want to watch you go.
Here it is.
I've found it.
Look.
It's what Cordelia was wearing.
|It's the symbol of Anyanka.
- I don't think I know her.
|- Well, no, um Anyanka is sort of a|patron saint of scorned women.
What does she do?
Uh, she grants wishes.
Cordelia wished for something?
If it was|a long, healthy life, she should get a refund.
She said something about|everything being different.
The world wasn't supposed to be like this.
It was, um, better before.
OK, the entire world sucks|because some dead ditz made a wish?
I just wanna be clear.
She said the Slayer was|supposed to be here, was meant to have been here already.
- It certainly would have helped.
|- Yes, I tried calling her, but Look, I'm going to have to research|this Anyanka thing further.
I have some more volumes at home.
- You two get some sleep.
|- Watch your back.
Run!
- Buffy Summers?
|- That's right.
You wanna tell me what I'm doing here?
Yes.
Here.
"In order to defeat Anyanka,|one must destroy her power centre".
"It should reverse all wishes she has granted,|rendering her powerless again".
You see?
Without her power centre, she'll be|an ordinary woman, and all this will be Well, different.
Well, I'd say that my watcher muscles|haven't completely atrophied after all.
Great.
What's her power centre?
- It doesn't say.
|- Why don't I put a stake through her heart?
- She's not a vampire.
|- You'd be surprised what that'll kill.
I don't want to kill her.
I want to reverse|whatever effect she's had on this world.
You're takin' a lot on faith here, Jeeves.
Giles.
Kill the bad fairy, destroy|the bad fairy's power centre, whatever.
- And all the troubles go away?
|- It's not that simple, but The world is what it is.
We fight,|we die.
Wishing doesn't change that.
I have to believe in a better world.
Go ahead.
I have to live in this one.
Cordelia said she knew that|I was meant to be your watcher.
- She said she knew you.
|- She was probably just a big fan.
The Master sent his most|vicious disciples to kill her.
She must have posed some threat to him.
- Master?
|- Supreme vampire around these parts.
He lives on the outskirts|of town in an old club.
You know where he lives, and|no one's ever tried to take him out?
People have tried.
Well, point the way.
I might|as well do some good in this town.
- You can't just walk in and|- You wanna stay and play make-believe, fine.
I can't help you anyway.
|There's only one thing I'm good at.
- At least let's muster some kind of force.
|- I don't play well with others.
Now I'm gonna ask you this once,|and then I'm gonna get testy.
Where's this club?
Buffy.
Buffy Summers.
It's you.
I mean, you don't remember.
How could you?
How did you know my name?
I waited.
I waited here for you.
But you never I was supposed to help you.
You were gonna help me?
The Master rose.
He let me live, to punish me.
I kept hopin' maybe you'd come.
My destiny.
Is this a "get in my pants" thing?
You guys in|Sunnydale talk like I'm the Second Coming.
- I'm sorry.
I just meant|- Look, I don't have time for stories.
Where's the Master?
They're at his factory.
It starts tonight.
- Factory?
|- Look, I could take you there.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
|- Wait!
I won't hurt you.
- No, you'll leave that to your Master.
|- You don't believe I wanna help you.
Believe I want him dead.
Behold the technical wonder which is about|to alter the very fabric of our society.
Some have argued that such|an advancement goes against our nature.
They claim that death is our art.
I say to them Well, I don't say|anything to them, because I kill them.
Undeniably we are|the world's superior race.
Yet we have always been too parochial, too bound by the mindless|routine of the predator.
Hunt and kill, hunt and kill.
Titillating?
Yes.
Practical?
Hardly.
Meanwhile the humans,|with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept: mass production.
We really are livin' in a golden age.
Anyanka, I beseech thee In the name of all women scorned, come before me.
Do you have any idea what I do to a man|who uses that spell to summon me?
Bring on the first!
You!
She's still alive here, see?
For the freshness.
What's the plan?
Don't fall on this.
- Welcome to the future.
|- To the future!
Uh-oh.
Puppy got out.
Cordelia Chase.
What did she wish for?
I had no idea her wish would be so exciting.
Brave new world.
I hope she likes it.
You're going to change it back.
I'm not afraid of you.
|Your only power lies in the wishing.
Wrong!
Buffy, look out!
Buffy.
This is the real world now.
This is the world we made.
Isn't it wonderful?
You trusting fool.
How do you know|the other world is any better than this?
Because it has to be.
No!
I wish Buffy Summers|had never come to Sunnydale.
- Done.
|- That would be cool.
No, wait.
I wish Buffy Summers|had never been born.
- Done.
|- And I wish that Xander Harris never again knows the touch of a woman.
And that Willow wakes up tomorrow|covered in monkey hair.
In fact, I wish all men, except maybe|the dumb and the really agreeable kind, disappear off the face of the Earth.
|That would be so cool.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
The curse.
If Angel achieved|true happiness, even just a moment, - he would lose his soul.
|- Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": This is it.
The curse.
- What?
|- I may be able to work this.
Willow cured him|and somehow he came back.
You must have known|it was wrong to see Angel.
I wanted to wait.
For Angel to go psycho again|the next time you give him a happy?
Why, Daniel, wherever are you goin'?
- You you're not human.
|- Not of late, no.
- What do you want?
|- I'm hungry, Daniel.
- And seeing as you're in my debt|- Please, I can't.
A man playing at cards should have a|natural intelligence or a great deal of money.
And you're sadly lacking in both.
So I'll take my winnings my own way.
The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
|He maketh me to lie down in green pastures Daniel, be of good cheer.
It's Christmas.
It's going to be warm, with temperatures|continuing in the high 70s throughout the holiday weekend, - Hi.
|- Angel.
So, are you shopping?
You're probably not shopping.
I couldn't sleep.
Vampires are probably not big|on Christmas, now I think about it.
Not as a rule.
But you're good?
- I'm all right.
You?
|- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm good.
I was just getting|some Christmas gifts for the gang.
I'd better go before the magic store closes.
Angel?
What is it?
And then he just bailed.
He didn't say|anything, he just took off.
It was so weird.
Angel?
Weird?
What are the odds?
Do you think something's wrong?
|Maybe you should tell Giles.
No.
I don't wanna bug Giles.
He's still kinda twitchy|on the subject of Angel.
Must be that Angel-killed-his|girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing.
Giles is pretty petty with stuff like that.
Xander, enough.
OK?
Maybe Angel just has the holiday blues.
Everybody gets 'em,|especially when they're alone.
It's just so frustrating.
I'm trying to do the right thing|and stay away from him and get over it.
And then boom, there he is.
I just want a nice, quiet Christmas vacation.
So, you doing anything special?
Tree.
Nog.
Roast beast.
Just me and mom|and hopefully an excess of gifts.
- What are you doing for Christmas?
|- Being Jewish.
Remember?
Not everybody worships Santa.
- I just meant for vacation.
|- Oh, nothing fun.
Oz and I had planned But I guess that's off.
Well, I'll be enjoying|my annual Christmas Eve camp-out.
I take my sleeping bag outside|and sleep on the grass.
- Sounds fun.
|- Yeah.
I look at the stars, feel the nature vibe.
I thought you slept outside to avoid|your family's drunken Christmas fights.
Yes, and that was a confidence|I was hoping you'd share with everyone.
Well, I'll be in Aspen.
Skiing.
- With actual snow.
|- I hear that helps.
It must be a drag to be stuck here|in Sweatydale, but I'm thinking of you.
OK, I'm done.
- She certainly has reverted to form.
|- It's not her fault.
After what happened,|we gotta cut her some slack.
- That's the Christmas spirit.
|- Hello?
Still Jewish.
Chanukah spirit, I believe that was.
Anyway, forgiveness is pretty much a big|theme with me this year because of the Hey.
OK.
The thing is Seeing you with Xander, it was Well, I never felt that way before - when there wasn't a full moon.
But I know you guys have a history.
But it's a history that's in the past.
Well, I guess most history is in the past.
But it's over.
Well, I don't know.
I don't know|that it ever will be between you two.
Oz, please believe me.
This is what I do know.
I miss you.
Like, every second.
It's like I lost an arm.
Or worse, a torso.
So I think I'd be willing to give it a shot.
Really?
Yeah.
Do you want us to to hug now?
Yeah, I'm good for that.
D'you wanna get one with snow on it?
Be very Christmassy.
- I think those are just for display.
|- Oh.
You know, honey, I was thinking.
Maybe we should invite Faith|to spend Christmas Eve with us.
I don't know.
Faith and I don't really hang out, or talk, or make eye contact lately.
Do you really wanna let her spend Christmas|Eve all by herself in that dingy motel room?
- You're still number one with the guilt trip.
|- I try.
- I'll ask her.
|- You're a doll.
- What about Giles?
He doesn't have|- I'm sure he's fine.
- We could at least ask him and see.
|- He doesn't wanna be with a bunch of girls.
Let's split up.
Bunch of 'em up and died on us.
|Don't know why.
If you want one,|I can make you a hell of a deal.
No, thank you.
Oh, honey, this one's perfect.
Yeah?
Work, dammit!
Hey.
What's goin' on?
Scary monsters?
Nope.
We're having Christmas Eve dinner|at my house, and if you didn't have plans Your mom sent you down, huh?
- No.
|- Well, thanks, but I got plans.
There's this big party I've been invited to.
It should be a blast.
OK.
Cool.
But if you change your mind, the offer It's nice of you, thanks, but I got I got that big party|that I've been invited to, so I like the lights.
Yeah, well, 'tis the season.
|Whatever that means.
Just a minute!
Hello.
I'm I'm sorry to bother you.
Sorry.
Coming from you, that phrase strikes|me as rather funny: sorry to bother me.
- I need your help.
|- And the funny keeps on coming.
I understand I have no right to ask for it, but there's no one else.
All right.
I can't come in unless you invite me.
I'm aware of that.
Come in.
I've been seeing I've had dreams lately.
About the past.
It's like I'm living it again, it's so vivid.
I need to know - I need to know why I'm here.
|- Here?
Back on earth?
I should be in a demon dimension|and suffering an eternity of torture.
- I don't feel inclined to argue with that.
|- But I'm not.
I was freed.
And I don't understand why.
- Knowing would give you peace of mind?
|- It might.
Is that something you ought to have?
Because, to be blunt, the last time you|became complacent about your existence, it turned out rather badly.
What?
Don't you see her?
Who?
I can't.
I propose a toast.
Well, it's nice to be back in London.
Please, I should return to the party.
- Margaret, there's no hurry.
|- Mistress will be wondering She'll be wondering how to get|Reverend Chalmers into bed, and will not notice the absence of canapés.
- Stay with me.
|- Sir, people might talk.
I'll be put out in the streets.
|My little boy would I can't lose this job.
- Then you best keep quiet.
|- You're hurting me.
Cry out, call for help.
I'm sure Mistress will|believe your behaviour beyond reproach.
- Please.
|- Come.
Make a scene, shall I?
No.
We'll be as quiet as mice.
No matter what.
Sir.
My son!
He'll make a fine dessert.
Trouble sleeping?
- You're not here.
|- I'm always here.
- Leave me alone.
|- I can't.
You won't let me.
What do you want?
To die in bed surrounded by grandchildren,|but I guess that's off the menu.
- I'm sorry.
|- You're sorry.
For me?
Don't bother.
I'm dead.
I'm over it.
If you wanna feel sorry for someone,|feel sorry for yourself.
- But I guess you've already got that covered.
|- Look, I am sorry for what I've done.
What else can I say to you?
I don't wanna make you feel bad.
I just want to show you who you are.
- You had a dream about Angel.
|- I was in Angel's dream.
- I'm not sure that's|- There was stuff I couldn't possibly know.
It was Angel's past.
He was dreaming it|and somehow I got sucked in.
There's something wrong with him.
I know.
I've seen him.
He wanted to know why he was back.
Is there away for us to find that out?
- Possibly.
I've been looking.
|- Well, let me look, too.
I'm not seeing him any more.
|I'm trying to put all this behind me.
And I won't be able to as long as we're doing|guest spots in each other's dreams.
So we'll help him?
Yes.
Where do we start?
I'm aware I haven't been the mostest best|friend to you when it comes to Angel, and I don't know, maybe|I've finally got the Chanukah spirit.
Well, we start, unsurprisingly, with research.
Xander - Black Chronicles, And, Buffy - the Diary of Lucius Temple,|An acolyte of Acathla, an expert on demons.
You can skip the passages on his garden,|unless you're keen on growing heartier beets.
Are you sure this is how|you wanna spend your vacation?
It's the most exciting thing I've got planned.
|Who else can claim that pathetic a social life?
Hey, guys.
What're we doin'?
He's gonna come over on Christmas Eve|cos my parents are out of town.
- We're gonna watch videos.
|- That's good, right?
You guys are back.
It's good.
It's perfect.
In an awkward, uncomfortable sort of way.
I just don't know how to make Oz trust me.
Xander has a piece of you|that Oz just can't touch.
I guess now it's just about|showing Oz that he comes first.
I guess.
Thanks.
- Hey!
He likes beets.
|- I read that one already.
We're not getting any closer.
The thing I remember most|was thinking how artful it was.
In the dark they looked|just like they were sleeping.
It wasn't until I bent down and kissed them|good night that I felt how cold they were.
You grabbed me and I thought: "Who would go to so much trouble|to arrange them like that"?
But you see That's what makes you|different than other beasts.
They kill to feed.
But you took more kinds of pleasure in it|than any creature that walks or crawls.
- Oh, God.
|- Yeah.
Cry out.
Make a scene.
I was to be married that week,|but then, as I recall, you knew that.
- It wasn't me.
|- It wasn't you?
A demon isn't a man.
I was a man once.
Oh, yes.
And what a man you were.
A drunken, whoring layabout and a terrible disappointment|to your parents.
I was young.
- I never had a chance to|- To die of syphilis?
You were a worthless being|before you were ever a monster.
Stop it!
I don't wanna hurt you, Angel,|but you have to understand.
Cruelty is the only thing|you ever had a true talent for.
It's not true.
Rest.
You mistake it for a curse, Angel, but it's not.
It's your destiny.
I'll show you.
- You want her.
|- No.
Take her.
Take what you want.
Pour all that frustration|and all that guilt into her and you'll be free.
No.
You can't live for eternity with all that pain.
This is what you are|and this is why we brought you back.
Take her.
And then you'll be ready to kill her.
Hey, Buffy.
Take a look.
These letters contain references|to an ancient power known as the First.
- First what?
|- Evil.
Absolute evil.
Older than man, than demons.
It could have had the power|to bring Angel back.
These guys.
I saw them in my dream.
I fell asleep up there.
You had another dream?
With Angel?
What happened?
Oh, we don't need to get sidetracked.
- Who are these guys?
|- They're known as Bringers or Harbingers.
They're high priests of the First.
They can conjure spirit manifestation|and set them on people.
- Influence them, haunt them.
|- These guys are working the mojo on Angel.
We gotta stop 'em.
You can't fight the First, Buffy.
|It's not a physical being.
- Well, I can fight these priest guys.
|- If we can find 'em.
It's the Slayer.
|What brings the Slayer down here?
Hey, Willy.
How you been?
Keeping outta trouble.
As God is my witness.
So what can I do for you?
Coupla drinks?
Yeah, let me get a double shot of - information, pal.
|- Three priests.
They call themselves - The Bringers.
|- Bringers.
Harbingers.
- They have a no-eyes kind of look.
|- Doesn't ring a bell.
How about I ring that bell for ya?
- Does the threatening come now?
|- Maybe you shouldn't help.
They'd have come to town recently.
They'd be|holed up somewhere, summoning the First.
Well I heard a few things.
|You know - from the underground.
- The underground?
|- Yeah.
From things living under the ground.
There's been migration out of Sunnydale|from the lower inhabitants.
Something's scaring them off.
And these|are things that are not easily scared.
- Could be your priest guys are underground.
|- Where?
I do not know.
OK.
- Thanks.
|- See you around.
You did great, by the way.
|I was very intimidated.
Really?
- Thanks.
|- Let's go.
Hey, kid.
Merry Christmas.
Man, is it hot.
It was so nice and cool in there.
Yeah.
A nice, cool waste of time.
We know underground, that's a start.
Sure!
In a town with|14 million square miles of sewer.
Plus a lot of natural cave formations|and a gateway to hell.
- Yeah, this does resemble square one.
|- I don't know what to do.
I think right now the best plan|is to deck the halls with boughs of holly.
Look, we'll catch the bad guys -|sooner or later.
Willow?
I got videos.
Hi.
Why don't you come sit down?
Ever have that dream where|you're in a play, and it's the middle, and you don't know your lines|and you kind of don't know the plot?
Well, we're alone and we're together.
I just wanted it to be special.
How special we talkin'?
Well, you know.
We're alone and we're both|mature younger people, and so we could I'm ready to with you We could do that thing.
- Where are you going?
|- No, I'm not going.
Just a dramatic gesture.
That's pretty special.
Oz, I wanna be with you.
First.
I think we should sit down again.
Oz I'm ready.
OK.
Well, don't take this the wrong way but I'm not.
- Are you scared?
Cos I thought you had|- No, I have.
But this is different.
I mean, you look great.
And you got the Barry working for you,|and it's all good.
But when it happens I want it to be because|we both need it to for the same reason.
You don't have to prove anything to me.
I just wanted you to know.
I know.
I get the message.
There we go.
Nothing like a fire|to keep away the blistering heat.
Oh, come on.
It's lovely.
Maybe I should turn the air conditioning on.
- Angel's on top again?
|- What?
Angel or star?
Star.
Hey.
Looks like that whole party thing|was gonna be kind of a drag.
I didn't really have anything You know.
I'm glad you came.
Here.
Why don't you come in|from the entire lack of cold?
That one is for your mom.
|They're pretty crappy.
Faith, you made it.
- Oh, that is so thoughtful.
|- They're crappy.
I'm gonna go upstairs and get your gifts.
Some nog?
OK, Mom, don't touch yours|cos then you're gonna know what it is.
Angel.
Buffy What is it?
I gotta Look, I had to see you.
I don't know.
I You shouldn't be Just tell me what's going on.
She wants you to touch her.
What are you waiting for?
Look, you have to stay away from me.
You came to see me|to tell me that I can't see you?
Angel, something is doing this to you.
You just have to control it, OK?
- I know you're confused.
|- I think you're the one who's confused.
I think you need to She wants you to taste her.
Think of the peace.
You'll never have to see us again.
- Angel, how can I help you?
|- Leave me alone!
Stay with Mom in case he comes back.
I'll play watchdog.
I don't get it, though.
- I'll explain later.
Everything, I promise.
|- Watch your back.
Giles, we have to do something.
Soon.
Now.
I'm still not sure what.
Find me these priest guys.
|Find me something I can pummel.
- Let's not lose our heads.
|- Giles, he's slipping.
I think we're losing him.
You realise if he truly becomes a danger, you may have to kill him.
Again.
Can you do that?
- I can't do it.
|- You have to do it.
- What else are you good for?
|- Get away from me.
Couldn't you just feel her?
Couldn't you almost smell her skin?
You never were a fighter, Angel.
|Don't start tryin' now.
Sooner or later you will drink her.
- I'll never hurt her.
|- You must.
Have you learned nothing?
- As long as you are alive|- Then I'll die.
- You don't have the strength to kill yourself.
|- I don't need strength.
I just need the sun to rise.
You're not supposed to die.
|This isn't the plan.
But it'll do.
"A child shall be born of man and goat|and have two heads, and the first shall speak only in riddles".
No wonder you like this stuff.
|It's like reading the Sun, Yes.
- Priests?
|- Yes, but more posturing, I'm afraid.
"They are the harbingers of death.
|Nothing shall grow above or below them".
"No seed shall flower, neither in man nor" They're rebels and they'll never be any good.
- Nothing specific about their haunts.
|- Let me see that.
"The harbingers of death".
"Nothing shall grow above or below" What?
All right.
Ten more minutes of chanting|and then you guys have to go to bed.
I'm impressed.
- You won't get Angel.
|- You think you can fight me?
I'm not a demon, little girl.
|I am something you can't even conceive.
The First Evil.
Beyond sin.
Beyond death.
I am the thing that darkness fears.
You'll never see me, but I am everywhere.
Every being, every thought,|every drop of hate.
All right, I get it!
You're evil.
|Do we have to chat about it all day?
Angel will be dead by sunrise.
Your Christmas will be his wake.
- No.
|- You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Let me guess.
Is it evil?
Dead by sunrise!
Angel!
I bet half the kids down there|are already awake, lying in their beds, sneaking downstairs, waiting for day.
Angel, please.
I need you to get inside.
|There's only a few minutes left.
I know.
I can smell the sunrise|long before it comes.
I don't have time to explain this.
|You just have to trust me.
- That thing that was haunting you|- It wasn't haunting me.
- It was showing me.
|- Showing you?
- What I am.
|- Were.
And ever shall be.
I wanted to know why I was back.
Now I do.
You don't know.
Some great evil takes credit for bringing|you back and you buy it?
You just give up?
I can't do it again, Buffy.
|I can't become a killer.
- Then fight it.
|- It's too hard.
- You have to get inside.
|- They told me to kill you.
You were in the dream.
They told me to lose|my soul in you and become a monster again.
- I know that.
What does it matter?
|- Because I wanted to!
Because I want you so badly.
I wanna take comfort in you.
And I know it'll|cost me my soul and part of me doesn't care.
I'm weak.
I've never been anything else.
It's not the demon in me|that needs killing, Buffy.
It's the man.
You're weak.
Everybody is.
Everybody fails.
Maybe this evil did bring you back,|but if it did it's because it needs you.
And that means that you can hurt it.
Angel, you have the power|to do real good, to make amends.
But if you die now,|then all that you ever were was a monster.
- Angel, the sun is coming up.
|- Just go.
- I won't.
|- Do you think this is simple?
You can never understand|what I've done.
Now, go.
- You are not staying.
I won't let you.
|- Leave!
Am I a thing worth saving, huh?
Am I a righteous man?
The world wants me gone.
What about me?
I love you so much.
And I tried to make you go away.
I killed you and it didn't help.
And I hate it.
I hate that it's so hard, and that you can hurt me so much.
I know everything that you did|because you did it to me.
God, I wish that I wished you dead.
I don't.
I can't.
Buffy, please.
Just this once, let me be strong.
Strong is fighting.
It's hard and it's painful and it's every day.
It's what we have to do|and we can do it together.
But if you're too much|of a coward for that, then burn.
If I can't convince you that you belong|in this world, then I don't know what can.
But do not expect me to watch, and don't expect me|to mourn for you, because While most of California|will have a balmy Christmas, an extreme cold front has sprung up|out of nowhere round Sunnydale, where they are reporting|heavy snow fall for the first time ever, Sunnydale residents won't see the sun at all|today, that cold front isn't going anywhere, temperatures in the high 30s means you|better bundle up if you're going outside.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Is it a vampire?
- Mom, what are you doing here?
|- I brought you a snack.
I thought it was about time for me to|come out and watch.
You know, the slaying.
The slaying is kind of an alone thing.
But it's such a big part of your life|and I'd like to understand it.
It's something we could share.
Actually, it's pretty dull.
|It's bam boom stick poof.
Good, honey.
Kill him!
Buffy, he's over here.
Oh, my God.
It's Mr Sanderson from the bank.
- He's getting away.
|- Stay.
Oh, God.
They said we can go home now.
They were little kids.
Did you see them?
They were so tiny.
I saw.
Who could do something like this?
I just I'm so sorry that you had to see this,|but I promise everything's gonna be OK.
- How?
|- Because I'm gonna find whatever did it.
I guess.
It's just you can't You can't make it right.
I know.
I'm sorry.
But I'll take care|of everything, I promise.
Just try and calm down.
Don't tell me to calm down.
- I only meant|- They were kids, Giles.
Little kids.
You don't know what it was like|to see them there.
My mom can't even talk.
I'm sorry.
I just want to help.
I know.
Do we know how?
- It wasn't the vampire?
|- No, there were no marks.
Wait I mean, there was a mark.
A symbol.
Try this.
It was on their hands.
The cops are|keeping it quiet but I got a good look at it.
There.
Find me the thing that uses|this symbol and point me at it.
What?
- Giles, speak.
|- Sorry.
I just wonder if we're looking for a thing.
The use of a symbol on a victim|like this suggests a ritual murder.
An occult sacrifice by a group.
A group of human beings?
Someone with a soul did this?
I'm afraid so.
OK.
And while you're looking for|the meaning of that symbol thingy, could you find a loophole in|that "slayers don't kill people" rule?
Buffy.
This is a dreadful crime, I know,|and you have every right to be upset.
But I wonder if you're not|letting yourself get a shade more personal because|of your mother's involvement?
It's completely personal.
Giles, find me the people that did this.
Please.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
So, burrito.
This is a burrito.
Damn straight.
Hi, Oz.
Xander, hi.
- Hey, Amy.
|- Hi, guys.
Hey, Amy.
I like your new hair.
- I haven't seen you all day.
Where you been?
|- Not with me.
No, sir.
Ask anyone.
No.
So, Buffy's birthday's next week.
Yeah.
Good.
I've been pondering gift options.
- Come on.
We just got a topic here.
|- Hi, Buffy.
Buffy, what's up?
- You guys didn't hear?
|- Hear what?
- A murder.
Somebody killed two little kids.
|- Oh, no.
They were seven or eight years old.
My mom|found the bodies during patrol last night.
- Oh, my God.
|- Kids?
- Why was your mom there?
|- More bad.
She picked last night|for a surprise bonding visit.
Your mom would actually|take the time to do that with you?
That really wasn't the|point of the story, was it?
No, the point is she's completely wigging.
Who's wigging?
Everyone.
You know, cos of what happened.
It's so awful.
|I had bad dreams about it all night.
- Hi, Mrs Summers.
|- Hi, everybody.
- Hi.
|- Hi, Mrs Summers.
Have you talked to Mr Giles yet|about who could have done this?
Yeah.
He He thinks it might be something ritual,|occult.
But he's still looking.
In the meantime, we're gonna add|to my patrol and keep an eye out.
Occult?
Like witches?
Sorry.
Phlegm.
Too much dairy.
I know you kids think that stuff's cool.
|Buffy told me you dabble.
Right.
Absolutely.
That's me.
I'm a dabbler.
But anybody who could do this isn't cool.
Anybody who could do this|has to be a monster.
You know what?
Would you guys|excuse us for a little bit?
Nice to see you.
What a burn.
Buff's mom was starting|to accept the whole slayer thing.
Now she's gonna be double-freaked.
Makes me grateful that my mom's not|interested in my extracurricular activities.
Or my curricular activities.
Are your friends gonna help|with the investigation?
Mom, I really think Maybe this isn't the best place|to talk about this.
Are you embarrassed to be hanging out|with your mother?
I didn't hug you.
No, it's just This hall is about school,|and you're about home.
Mix them, my world dissolves.
It's just, I keep thinking about who could|have done such a thing.
I have to help.
- Giles can use help in the library.
|- I called everybody I know.
I told them about the dead children.
|They're all just as upset as I am.
- You called everybody you know?
|- And they called all their friends.
And guess what?
We're setting up|a vigil for tonight, for City Hall.
The Mayor is even gonna be there.
|Now we are gonna get some action.
That's great.
But you know what?
A lot of|times when we're working on stuff like this, we like to keep the number of people|that know about it kind of small.
Right.
Well, I'm sure|there won't be all that many people.
This is great.
Maybe we could|all go patrolling together later.
At least your mom's making an effort.
|My mom's probably standing right in front of me|right this second.
- Mom.
|- Willow.
I didn't know you would be here.
- Hi, Bunny.
|- Hi.
Mom, what are you doing here?
I read about it in the paper and,|what with your dad out of town Willow, you cut off your hair.
|That's a new look.
Yeah, it's just a sudden whim I had in August.
I like it.
- Hello, Joyce.
|- Sheila, I'm glad you could come.
There you are.
|I almost didn't find you in this crush.
Mrs Joyce.
- Quite a turnout you have here.
|- Well, it's not just me, but thank you.
- Well, it's been a while.
|- Right.
Not since Not since Not for a while.
There's a rumour going around, Mr Giles.
Rumour?
About us?
About what?
About witches.
People calling themselves|witches are responsible for this brutal crime.
Indeed?
How strange.
Yes.
Strange.
Witches.
Well, actually not that strange.
|I recently co-authored a paper about the rise of mysticism|among adolescents.
I was shocked at the statistical Are we starting?
- Hello, everybody.
|- He'll do something about this.
You'll see.
I wanna thank you all for coming|in the aftermath of such a tragic crime.
Seeing you all here proves|what a caring community Sunnydale is.
Sure, we've had our share of misfortunes,|but we're a good town, with good people.
And I know that none of us will rest easy|until this horrible murder is solved.
With that in mind,|I make these words my pledge to you.
"Never again"!
.
I ask you to give your attention to the woman|who brought us all here - Joyce Summers.
Thank you.
Mr Mayor, you're dead wrong.
This is not a good town.
How many of us have lost|someone who just disappeared?
Or got skinned?
Or suffered neck rupture?
And how many of us have been|too afraid to speak out?
I was supposed to lead us in a moment of|silence, but silence is this town's disease.
For too long, we've been|plagued by unnatural evils.
This isn't our town any more.
It belongs to the monsters|and the witches and the slayers.
I say it's time for the grown-ups|to take Sunnydale back.
I say we start by finding the people|who did this and making them pay.
- Watch it.
|- Sorry.
Did I make you smudge your eyeliner?
|Gonna put a spell on me?
Hey, what is your problem?
Everyone knows he's into|that voodoo-witch crap.
I heard about those kids.
|People like him gotta learn a lesson.
And what about people like me?
Get in my face and you'll find out.
No problem here.
We're walking.
- You guys OK?
|- Yeah.
We're fine.
Thanks, Buffy.
- You'll be a busy slayer, baby-sitting them.
|- I doubt they'll have any more trouble.
I doubt your doubt.
Everyone knows that|witches killed those kids, and Amy is a witch.
Michael is whatever the boy of witch is,|plus being the poster child for yuck.
If you're gonna hang with them,|expect badness.
That's what you get when you hang with|freaks and losers.
Believe me, I know.
That was a pointed comment|about me hanging with you guys.
Yeah, I got that one.
|Besides, witches didn't do it.
Actually, I think they may have.
My research|keeps taking me to European Wiccan covens.
You found the meaning of the symbol?
I'm pretty sure.
There's some information I|need that's in a book that Willow borrowed.
Can you find her?
- Buffy, hi.
|- Hey.
Is Willow around?
How can I convince you that it's over?
You assume because I'm here, she's here.
|That I mysteriously know where she is.
- Those her books?
|- Yeah.
She's in the bathroom.
But the fact that I know that|doesn't change that I have a complaint.
Look.
I'm getting sick|of the judgement.
The innuendoes Is a man not innocent until proven guilty?
You are guilty.
You got illicit smoochies.
|You have to pay the price.
I'm talking about the future guilt.
|Everyone expects me to mess up again.
Like Oz.
I see how he is around me.
You know, that steely gaze,|that pointed silence.
- Cos he's usually such a chatterbox.
|- No, it's different now.
It's more a verbal nonverbal.
|He speaks volumes with his eyes.
Hey, Buff.
What you looking for?
|You wanna borrow something?
- What is this?
|- A doodle.
I do doodle.
You, too.
You do doodle, too.
- This is a witch symbol.
|- OK.
Yeah.
It is.
- Willow.
|- What?
That symbol was on the murdered children.
Kids, step back.
Stay away from|the lockers.
This is police business.
You wanna give me those, please?
|The books?
Hey!
It's not mine.
Oh, man, it's Nazi Germany|and I've got Playboys in my locker.
This is a glorious day|for principals everywhere.
No pathetic whining about students' rights, just a long row of lockers|and a man with a key.
- They just took three kids away.
|- What are they looking for?
- Witch stuff.
|- What?
They got my spells.
|I have to report to Snyder's office.
Oh, my God.
OK, Amy.
You'll have to come with me.
I have stuff in my locker.
|Henbane, hellebore, mandrake root.
Excuse me.
Playboys,|Can we turn the sympathy this way?
- Hey!
Get your grubby, custodial hands off.
|- Stay back.
That hair spray cost $45, and it's imported.
My locker's next.
|Buffy, I didn't do anything wrong.
The symbol is harmless.
|I used it to make a protection spell for you, for your birthday,|with Michael and Amy.
Only now it's broken because|you know about it, so happy birthday.
And, please, you have to believe me.
Ms Rosenberg.
My office.
Giles.
- They're confiscating my books.
|- We need those books.
I tried to tell that|to the nice man with the gun.
There's something about the symbol.
Willow said she used it in a protection spell.
|It's harmless, not a big bad.
So why would it turn up in a ritual sacrifice?
I don't know.
Ordinarily,|I'd say widen our research.
Using what?
|A dictionary and My Friend Flicka?
This is intolerable.
|Snyder has interfered before, but I won't take it|from that twisted homunculus.
I love the smell of|a desperate librarian in the morning.
You get out, and take|your marauders with you.
Oh, my.
So fierce.
I suppose I should hear you out.
|Just how is Blood, Rites and Sacrifices appropriate|material for a public-school library?
Chess club branching out?
- This is not over.
|- I should say it's just beginning.
Fight it if you want.
But lift a finger against|me, and you'll have to answer to MOO.
Answer to MOO?
Did that sentence just|make some sense that I'm not in on?
Mothers Opposed to the Occult.
|A powerful new group.
And who came up with that lame name?
That would be the founder.
|I believe you call her "Mom".
Sit down, honey.
- Principal Snyder talked to you?
|- Yes.
He's quite concerned.
- Mom, I know what this looks like|- You don't have to explain, honey.
This isn't exactly a surprise.
Why not?
Identification with mythical icons is|perfectly typical of your age group.
It's a classic adolescent response to|the pressures of incipient adulthood.
Is that what it is?
Of course, I wish you could have|identified with something less icky, but developmentally speaking Mom, I'm not an age group.
I'm me.
Willow group.
Oh, honey.
- I understand.
|- No, you don't.
Mom, this may be hard for you|to accept, but I can do stuff.
Nothing bad or dangerous,|but I can do spells.
You think you can, and that's|what concerns me.
The delusions Mom, how would you know what I can do?
The last time we had|a conversation over three minutes, it was about the patriarchal bias|of the Mister Rogers' show.
King Friday was lording it|over the lesser puppets - You're not paying attention.
|- And this is your way of trying to get it.
Now, I have consulted with my colleagues|and they agree that this is a cry for discipline.
- You're grounded.
|- Grounded?
This is the first time ever I've done|something you don't like and I'm grounded?
I'm supposed to mess up.
|I'm a teenager, remember?
- You're upset.
I hear you.
|- No, Ma.
Hear this.
I'm a rebel.
I'm having a rebellion.
Willow, honey.
You don't need to act out|like this to prove your specialness.
Mom, I'm not acting out.
I'm a witch.
I can make pencils float, and I can summon the four elements.
OK, two, but four soon.
And I'm dating a musician.
Oh, Willow.
I worship Beelzebub.
I do his biddings.
|Do you see any goats around?
- No, because I sacrificed them.
|- Willow.
- All bow before Satan.
|- I'm not listening to this.
Prince of Night, I summon you.
|Come fill me with your black, naughty evil.
That's enough.
Is that clear?
Now, you will go to your room|and stay there until I say otherwise.
We're gonna make some changes.
I don't|want you hanging out with those friends.
It's clear where this|little obsession came from.
You will not speak to|Bunny Summers again.
I don't want you seeing|that Willow any more.
I've spoken with her mother.
I had no idea|her forays into the occult had gone so far.
- You ordered the raid on the school today.
|- Honey, they opened a few lockers.
Lockers.
First syllable "lock".
They should be private,|and they took all Giles' books away.
He'll get most of them back.
MOO just|wants to weed out the offensive material.
- Everything else will be returned soon.
|- To solve this, we need those books now.
Sweetie, those books have no place|in a public-school library.
Especially now.
Any student can waltz in there|and get all sorts of ideas.
Do you understand how that terrifies me?
Mom, I hate that these people scared you|so much.
And I know you're trying to help.
But you have to let me|handle this.
It's what I do.
But is it really?
You patrol, you slay.
Evil pops up, you undo it, and that's great.
But is Sunnydale getting any better?
|Are they running out of vampires?
- I don't think that you "run out"|- It's not your fault.
You don't have a plan.
You just react|to things.
It's bound to be fruitless.
OK, maybe I don't have a plan.
- Lord knows, I don't have lapel buttons.
|- Buffy Maybe next time the world gets sucked|into hell, I won't be able to stop it because the anti-hell-sucking book|isn't on the reading list.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to put down Yeah, well, you did.
It doesn't matter.
I have to go.
I have to go on one of my pointless patrols|and "react" to some vampires, if that's all right with MOO.
And nice acronym, Mom.
I'm just trying to make things better.
- You are.
|- There's bad people out there.
- And we can't sleep.
|- Not until you hurt them.
The way they hurt us.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
- How are you?
|- I'm all right.
I think I'm better than you right now.
I heard about this.
People are talking.
People are even talking to me.
It's strange.
People die in Sunnydale all the time.
I've never seen anything like this.
They were children.
Innocent.
It makes a difference.
And Mr Sanderson from|the bank had it coming?
My mom said some things|to me about being the Slayer.
That it's fruitless.
No fruit for Buffy.
- She's wrong.
|- Is she?
Is Sunnydale any better|than when I first came here?
OK, so I battle evil.
But I don't really win.
The bad keeps coming back|and getting stronger.
Like that kid in the story, the boy|that stuck his finger in the duck.
Dyke.
It's another word for "dam".
OK.
That story makes a lot more sense now.
Buffy, you know I'm still figuring things out.
|There's a lot I don't understand.
I do know it's important to keep fighting, and I learned that from you.
- But we never|- We never win.
- Not completely.
|- We never will.
That's not why we fight.
We do it|cos there's things worth fighting for.
Those kids.
Their parents.
Their parents.
- I know it's not much.
|- No.
No, it's a lot.
"Session interrupted"?
.
Who said you could interrupt,|you stupid, useless fad?
I said "fad", and I'll say it again.
At that point, I will become frightened.
- Take heart.
We found your books.
|- Put the heart back.
We can't get 'em.
|They're locked up in City Hall.
"Frisky Watcher's chat room".
Giles!
- Buffy, Oz and I found out|- What do we know about these kids?
- What?
|- Facts.
Details.
- Well, they were found in the park.
|- No.
Where did they go to school?
Who were their parents?
|What are their names?
We know everything about their deaths,|but not even their names.
Sure we do.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It never came up.
Ever.
And if no one knows who they are,|where did these pictures come from?
I just assumed someone had the details.
|I never really That is strange.
- We need to get some information.
|- Can somebody else do it?
It locked me out.
- Well, if you wouldn't yell at it.
|- I can look, but Willow'd know the sites.
- Great.
She can't even come to the phone.
|- We don't need a phone.
All right, we're linked.
If anybody's ID'd|the kids, she'll pull it up and feed it here.
"Two children found dead.
|Mysterious mark" No.
These children were|found near Omaha in 1949.
Yeah, they ain't ours.
Keep going.
Wait.
- Those are|- The same kids.
- A hundred years.
How is this possible?
|- There's no mention of who they were.
They've never been seen alive,|just dead.
A lot.
Look.
There were more articles.
|Every 50 years.
All the same.
From as far back as 1649.
Can I see that?
Written by a cleric from|a village near the Black Forest.
He found the bodies himself.
Two children.
Greta Strauss, age six.
Hans Strauss, eight.
So they have names.
That's new.
Willow.
I thought I made myself clear.
|You're not minding me.
- Mom.
|- I see that you're challenging me.
But I will not have you communicating|with your cybercoven or what have you.
Coven?
What happened to me|being delusional and acting out?
That was before I talked in depth|with Ms Summers and her associates.
It seems I've been rather closed-minded.
So you believe me?
I believe you, dear.
Now all I can do is let you go with love.
Let me go?
What does that mean?
Mom?
Now, wait a minute.
There is a fringe theory|held by a few folklorist that some regional stories|have actual, very literal, antecedents.
- And in some language that's English?
|- Fairytales are real.
Hans and Gre Hansel and Gretel?
Wait.
Hansel and Gretel?
- Breadcrumbs, ovens, gingerbread house?
|- Of course.
It makes sense now.
Yeah, it's all falling into place.
Of course,|that place is nowhere near this place.
Some demons thrive by fostering hatred|and persecution amongst the mortal animals.
Not by destroying men,|but by watching them destroy each other.
They feed us our darkest fear and turn|peaceful communities into vigilantes.
Hansel and Gretel tell everyone|about the mean old witch.
Then she, and maybe dozens of others,|are persecuted by a righteous mob.
It's happened throughout history.
|It happened in Salem, not surprisingly.
I'm still spinning on this whole|"fairytales are real" thing.
- So what do we do?
|- I don't know, but I'm gonna go trade|my cow in for some beans.
- No one else is seeing the funny here?
|- We need to talk to Mom.
If she knows the truth,|she can defuse the whole thing.
- What happened?
|- I was attacked.
- Officially not funny.
|- By whom?
My dad.
His friends.
|They're taking people out of their homes.
- There's a trial at City Hall.
They got Amy.
|- Michael, stay here.
We'll go find my mom.
- Willow.
|- Tell her to get out of her house.
Stay in my office.
Mom.
We really have to talk.
- Time to go.
And get your coat.
It's chilly out.
|- Go?
Go where?
I said get your coat, witch!
Did you speak with|the families on Sycamore Street?
Buffy.
Mr Giles.
Did something happen?
- Mom, we need to talk to you.
Now.
|- Well, of course, honey.
Go on without me.
No, we need to talk alone.
There's more to this than You were right.
It was easy.
- I told you.
|- It gets even easier.
But I'm still scared of the bad girls.
You have to stop them.
|You have to make them go away.
For ever.
Willow!
- Hold still.
Be a good girl.
|- No!
Why are you doing this to me?
Mom!
There's no cure but the fire.
Buffy!
Wake up!
This is crazy, Mom.
Buffy!
Wake up!
- Cordelia?
|- Took you long enough to wake up.
My hand hurts.
Pity.
- Why are you here?
|- Things are way out of control, Giles.
First the thing at school,|then my mom confiscates all of my black clothes and scented candles.
I came to tell Buffy to stop this craziness,|and found you all unconscious again.
How many times have you|been knocked out, anyway?
I swear, one of these times,|you're gonna wake up in a coma.
Wake up in Never mind.
We need to save Buffy|from Hansel and Gretel.
Now, let's be clear.
|The brain damage happened before I hit you.
What's with the grim?
|We're here to join you guys.
No, really.
Why should you guys have|all the fun?
We wanna be part of the hate.
Just so we're clear,|you guys know you're nuts, right?
- Buffy!
|- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Mom, you don't want this.
|- Since when does it matter what I want?
I wanted a normal, happy daughter.
|Instead, I got a slayer.
- Torch.
|- Thanks.
This has been so trying.
|You've been such a champ.
- You, too, Joyce.
|- We should stay close.
Have lunch.
I'd like that.
How nice.
- You can't be serious.
|- Mom, don't!
All right.
You wanna fry a witch?
|I'll give you a witch!
Goddess Hecate, work thy will.
Before thee, let the unclean thing crawl.
- She couldn't do us first?
|- You've seen what we can do.
Another step and you will all feel my power.
What are you gonna do?
|Float a pencil at 'em?
It's a really big power.
Yes.
You will all be turned into vermin.
And some of you will be fish.
Yeah, you in the back will be fish.
- Maybe we should go.
|- But you promised.
You have to kill the bad girls.
I can't believe you had this stuff|in your apartment.
It smells foul.
Shred the wolfsbane - that's the leafy stuff.
|And then you can crush the satyrion root.
Lüften Sie den something - Schumer?
Schuluter?
|- What are you muttering about?
It's an incantation.
It's in German,|and without my books - What does it mean?
|- It's about lifting a veil.
It should make the demons|appear in their true form, which, with any luck,|will negate their influence.
And drop a toadstone into the mixture.
This?
- It doesn't look like a toad.
|- No reason it should.
It's from inside the toad.
I hate you.
We gotta get inside.
Oh, God!
Help!
- Will?
|- Sounds like she's right above us?
- They hurt us.
|- Burn them.
Mom, dead people are talking to you.
|Do the math.
- I'm sorry, Buffy.
|- Mom, look at me.
You love me.
You're not gonna be able|to live with yourself if you do this.
You earned this.
|You toyed with unnatural forces.
What kind of a mother would I be|if I didn't punish you?
You got hair with that.
God, you really were the little|youthful offender, weren't you?
You must just look back on that and cringe.
Buffy, I can't take it.
It's too hot.
Sorry, Will.
If it wasn't for me,|none of this would have happened.
It wouldn't be Stop them!
Buffy!
I'm on fire!
- Cordelia, put out the fire!
|- Right.
OK, I think I liked the two little ones|more than the one big one.
Oh, my God!
Protect us!
Kill the bad girls!
You know what?
|Not as convincing in that outfit.
Did I get it?
Did I get it?
We're here to save you.
- Your mom doesn't mind us doing this here?
|- She doesn't know.
- Business as usual?
|- Sort of.
She's doing that selective-memory thing|your mom was so good at.
- She forgot everything?
|- No.
She remembered the part where|I said I was dating a musician.
Oz has to come for dinner next week.
|So that's sort of like taking an interest.
- OK, shall we try this again?
|- Let's do it.
I think we got the mix|of herbs right this time.
OK.
Ready?
Diana.
Hecate.
I hereby license thee to depart.
Goddess of creatures great and small,|I conjure thee to withdraw.
Maybe we should get her one|of those wheel thingies.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Gotcha.
|- Right in the heart.
Satisfied?
I'm not sure that's the word.
OK.
- I didn't mean satisfied like|- No, I wasn't trying to Cos we're not having satisfaction|in the personal sense.
Of course.
- I should go.
Giles is|- Is waiting for you.
Yeah, I know.
Thanks.
For the work-out.
Am I going to see you this weekend?
You you you probably have plans.
Right.
Birthday.
Actually, I do have a thing.
A thing.
Date?
Nice attempt at casual.
Actually, I do have a date.
Older man.
Very handsome.
Likes it when I call him "Daddy".
Your father.
It is your father, right?
He's taking me to the ice show.
|It should be big fun.
I could use a little fun.
This one?
- Amethyst.
|- Used for?
Breath mints?
Charm bags, money spells,|and for cleansing one's aura.
OK.
How do you know|if one's aura is dirty?
Does somebody come by|and write "wash me" on it?
Buffy, I'm aware of your distaste|at studying vibratory stones, but since it is part of your training,|I would appreciate your glib-free attention.
Sorry.
It's just, with Faith on one|of her unannounced walkabouts, somebody should be patrolling.
Faith is not interested in proper|training.
So I must rely on you.
- I hate being the good one.
|- As for patrolling, you'll be there soon.
Why so anxious?
I guess that I just have some energy to burn.
Well, in due time.
But, for the present, if it's not entirely beyond your capabilities,|try to concentrate.
- That looked funny.
Do it again.
|- I'll kill you for that.
For that?
What were you|trying to kill me for before?
OK, so here's the deal Let me know if I'm not doing this right.
A bit early in the day.
Giles, something's wrong.
Wrong?
Perhaps you shouldn't do that any more.
On top of that, I got a bad case of|the dizzies and almost let a vamp stake me.
With my own stake.
I'm way off my game.
My game's left the county.
It's in|Cuernavaca.
Giles, what's going on here?
Perhaps you've got|a bad flu bug or something.
No.
No, not sick.
I can't get sick.
My dad's coming to take me to the ice show.
We do it every year for my birthday.
If I cancel, it's gonna break his heart.
Well, just take it easy for 48 hours.
Forgo patrolling until you feel yourself again.
No.
No, I just need to spend|a little more time training.
- I'm gone.
|- Thank you.
An ice show?
A show performed on ice.
- How old are we again?
|- I went to Snoopy on Ice when I was little.
My dad took me backstage and I got|so scared I threw up on Woodstock.
I know you think it's a big,|dumb, girly thing, but it's not.
A lot of the skaters|are Olympic medal winners.
Dad buys me cotton candy and|one of those souvenir programmes and OK, it's a big, dumb, girly thing, but I love it.
It's not so girly.
Ice is cool.
|It's water, but it's not.
It's sweet you and your dad have a tradition.
Especially now that|he's not around so much.
Ixnay on the caramel corn though|if you go backstage.
But we're still talking party?
Some of us still|love to relish celebrating the birth of the Buff.
I don't know.
It might be time to put|a moratorium on parties in my honour.
They tend to go badly.
|Monsters crash, people die But 18's a big one, Buffy.
I mean,|you can vote now.
You can be drafted.
You can vote not to be drafted.
I think I'll celebrate this one|with quiet reflection.
Where's it written that quiet reflection|can't be combined with cake and funny hats?
Buffy?
Present.
Present.
They're not.
They're from your father.
His quarterly projections are unravelling|and he can't afford to take off.
He promises to make it up to you.
|It's all right there in the letter.
If you want, I could ask somebody|to cover for me at the gallery.
I mean, if you want me to take you.
No.
No, that's not necessary.
I was just thinking it might be|nice to have a quiet birthday.
- How much longer, Hobson?
|- Five, maybe six hours, sir.
Once you've finished,|you and Blair can get some rest.
But sleep in shifts.
We're getting very close.
The Slayer's preparation is nearly complete.
You know, it's not just cartoon characters.
|They do pieces from operas and ballets.
Brian Boitano doing Carmen is a life changer.
He doesn't actually play Carmen.
|But a lot of sophisticated people go.
Yes, I think we should start|with the grounding crystal again.
It's usually something|that families do together.
Look very carefully for|the tiny flaw at its core.
If someone were free, they'd take|their daughters, or their student, or their slayer.
Yes, but, Buffy, I think|we should concentrate now.
Now, look for the flaw at its centre.
Buffy?
I'm sorry.
Did I zone out on you?
I'm just I'm nursing that flu bug.
Best take care of that.
- Perhaps we should|- Call it a night.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Thanks.
Good night.
How's it going with Amy the rat?
Good.
She loves her exercise wheel.
|She runs around, her nose wiggles I meant, how's it going changing|her back into a human being?
Still working on it.
|But I just got her the cutest little bell You don't do that to me.
|I waited for you at the Bronze all night.
And the big deal is?
You made me look like some|kind of dork in front of my posse.
First of all, "posse"?
Passé.
Second, anyone with a teaspoon of brains|knows not to take my flirting seriously.
Especially with my|extenuating circumstances.
- What circumstances?
|- Rebound.
Look it up.
- Hey, I'm not through here.
|- I beg to differ.
- What is wrong with you?
|- The chick started it.
Are you OK?
OK, I just got swatted down by some|no neck and rescued by Cordelia.
- What is happening?
|- It will sort itself out.
Look, you're not getting the big picture|here.
I have no strength.
I have no coordination.
- I throw knives like|- A girl?
Like I'm not the Slayer.
Look, Buffy, I I assure you, given time, we'll get to the bottom|of whatever's causing this anomaly.
- Promise me?
|- Yes.
I give you my word.
You're having doubts, Cruciamentum is not easy.
|For Slayer or Watcher.
But it's been done this way|for a dozen centuries.
Whenever a slayer turns 18.
|It's a time-honoured rite of passage.
It's an archaic exercise in cruelty.
To lock her in this tomb,|weakened, defenceless, and to unleash that on her.
If any one of the Council still had contact|with a slayer they would see, but I'm the one in the thick of it.
You can't make this decision -|you're too close.
- That's not true.
|- A slayer is not just physical prowess.
She must have cunning, imagination.
A confidence derived from self-reliance.
And believe me, once this is all over,|your Buffy will be stronger for it.
Or she'll be dead for it.
Rupert, if this girl is everything you say,|then you've nothing to worry about.
Sir, if you can spare me for a short spell,|I'll need to make a run to the hardware store.
Take care of it.
Come along, come along.
Kralik.
Your pills.
Open your mouth.
That's enough.
Close it up.
"A curse on slayers".
Oh, no, wait.
It's "lawyers".
Maybe we're on the wrong track with|the whole spell, curse and whammy thing.
Maybe what we should be looking for|is something like slayer kryptonite.
Faulty metaphor.
Kryptonite kills.
You assume I meant green kryptonite.
|I was referring to red kryptonite, which drains Superman of his powers.
Wrong, gold kryptonite's the power-sucker.
The red kryptonite mutates Superman into Guys?
Reality?
Buffy, I know you are definitely, without|a doubt, gonna get your powers back.
Thanks, Will.
But what if you don't?
OK.
If I don't get my powers back, then I don't.
I'll deal.
- And there's a whole lot of good sides to it.
|- Actually, this could open up so many - Did you find anything?
|- No.
Not yet.
It's your shift.
- Pills.
|- Yes.
It's coming.
Pills.
- Take them.
|- Pills.
- They're right in front of you.
|- Where?
- Here.
|- I can't see can't can't reach it.
Open your eyes.
Everything's OK now.
Thank you.
It's beautiful.
- You really like it?
|- Of course I do.
It's sweet and thoughtful and full of neat words to learn and say,|like "wilt" and "henceforth".
Then why did you seem more excited last|year when you got a severed arm in a box?
I'm sorry.
It's just suddenly there's this chance|that my calling's a wrong number, and - it's freaking me out a little.
|- That's understandable.
Angel, what if I have lost my power?
You've lived a long time without it.
|You can do it again.
I guess.
But what if I can't?
I've seen too much.
I know|what goes bump in the night.
Not being able to fight it What if I just hide under my bed,|all scared and helpless?
Or what if I become pathetic, hanging out at the old slayers' home,|talking about my glory days, showing them the stake I had bronzed?
Buffy, you could never be helpless|or boring, not even if you tried.
Don't be so sure.
Before I was the Slayer, I was|well, I don't want to say shallow, but let's say a certain person, who will|remain nameless - we'll call her Spordelia - looked like a classical|philosopher next to me.
Angel, if I'm not the Slayer,|what do I do?
What do I have to offer?
Why would you like me?
I saw you before you became the Slayer.
- What?
|- I watched you, and I saw you called.
It was a bright afternoon,|out in front of your school.
You walked down the steps, and and I loved you.
Why?
Because I could see your heart.
You held it before you for everyone to see, and I worried that it|would be bruised or torn.
And more than anything in my life I wanted|to keep it safe, to warm it with my own.
That's beautiful.
Or, taken literally, incredibly gross.
I was just thinking that too.
You're up.
I was afraid I'd drained|you too much.
I do that sometimes.
Ever have a tune you can't get out of your|head, that keeps playing over and over?
It drives me nuts.
Thank you.
That is much better.
It's a game, you know.
We're not going to play by their rules,|but that doesn't mean we're not gonna play.
Why don't you call your friend in here?
|We'll discuss it over dinner.
Quentin?
Hello?
Quentin?
Hob?
- She's cute.
|- Yeah.
Let's find out.
Hey, sweet girl.
How much for|a lap dance for me and my buddy?
"Walk me home, Angel?
No, I'm fine.
|I can take care of myself".
Hummers.
Big turn-off.
I like guys that can remember the lyrics.
You know, I wish I could,|but my mind just isn't what it used to be.
- Let me go.
|- You didn't say "please".
Help me, somebody.
Please.
Help me, please.
Help me, please.
Somebody, please help me.
No.
Stop.
Please.
I need help.
Please stop.
Hurry.
When I hit him, it felt like my arm|was broken, it hurt so much.
I can't be just a person.
|I can't be helpless like that.
Giles, please.
We have to|figure out what's happening to me.
It's an organic compound|of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressors.
The effect is temporary.
You'll be yourself again in a few days.
You?
It's a test, Buffy.
It's given to the Slayer once she|if she reaches her 18th birthday.
The Slayer is disabled, and then entrapped with a vampire whom|she must defeat in order to pass the test.
The vampire you were to face has escaped.
His name is Zackary Kralik.
As a mortal, he murdered and tortured|more than a dozen women before he was committed to|an asylum for the criminally insane.
When a vamp You bastard.
All this time you saw|what it was doing to me.
All this time and you didn't say a word.
- I wanted to.
|- Liar.
In matters of tradition and protocol,|I must answer to the Council.
My role in this was very specific.
I was to administer the injections and to|direct you to the old boarding house - on Prescott Lane.
|- I can't I can't hear this.
Buffy, please.
Who are you?
How could you do this to me?
I am deeply sorry,|and you have to understand If you touch me, I'll kill you.
You have to listen to me.
Because|I've told you this, the test is invalidated.
You will be safe now, I promise.
Whatever I have to do to deal with Kralik - and to win back your trust|- You stuck a needle in me.
You poisoned me.
What's going on?
Oh, God.
Is the world ending?
|I have to research a paper on Bosnia, but if the world's ending,|I'm not gonna bother.
You can't walk home alone,|Buffy.
It isn't safe.
I don't know you.
Did something take her memory?
He's Giles.
Gi-les.
He hangs out here a lot.
Cordelia, could you please drive me home?
Of course.
But if the world doesn't end,|I'm gonna need a note.
Buffy?
Mother.
Mother.
May I call you Mother?
My own mother was a person|with no self-respect of her own, so she tried to take mine.
Ten years old, she had the scissors - you|wouldn't believe what she did with those.
But she's dead to me now.
Mostly because I killed and ate her, but also because I know|I won't be alone much longer.
I'll have your daughter.
I won't kill her, I'll just make her like me.
Different.
She'll go to sleep, and when she wakes up,|your face will be the first thing she eats.
I have a problem with mothers.
|I'm aware of that.
I was just trying to reach you.
- I was on watch, by the boarding house.
|- Then you'll know what's happened.
Yes.
He's killed Hobson|and made Blair one of his own.
Your perfectly controlled test seems to have spun rather impressively|out of control, don't you think?
- It changes nothing.
|- Well, then allow me.
I've told Buffy everything.
That is in opposition to the Council's orders.
Yes.
Interestingly, I don't give|a rat's arse about the Council's orders.
There will be no test.
The test has already begun.
Your slayer|entered the field of play ten minutes ago.
- Why?
|- I don't know.
I returned there as she entered.
- Giles, we've no business interfering.
|- This is not business.
Hide and seek.
Hide and seek.
Why did you come|to the dark of the woods?
To bring all these sweets|to Grandmother's house?
Oh, no, no.
Just a little lower.
Right Oh, yes.
Yes Thank you very much.
If you stray from the path,|you will lose your way.
I won't take it all.
I won't take it all No.
No.
No.
Buffy?
Buffy, we have to get out.
Where are they?
Where are they?
You you don't seem to|understand your place in all of this.
Do you have any idea?
Oh, my.
What have you?
My pills?
No.
No.
If I was at full Slayer power,|I'd be punning right about now.
No.
No.
Buffy, thank God you're OK.
Oh, that man - I can't get these.
They're too tight.
|- Can't you just?
Not right now.
Maybe there's|some clippers around.
Congratulations, You passed, You exhibited extraordinary courage|and clear-headedness in battle.
The Council is very pleased.
Do I get a gold star?
- I understand that you're upset|- You understand nothing.
You set that monster loose|and he came after my mother.
You think the test was unfair?
I think you better leave town|before I get my strength back.
We're not in the business of "fair".
|We're fighting a war.
You're waging a war.
She's fighting it.
Mr Giles, if you don't mind - The test is done.
We're finished.
|- Not quite.
She passed.
You didn't.
The Slayer is not the only one|who must perform in this situation.
I have recommended to the Council that you be relieved of your duties|as watcher immediately.
You're fired.
On what grounds?
Your affection for your charge has|rendered you incapable of clear judgement.
You have a father's love for the child,|and that is useless to the cause.
It would be best if you had|no further contact with the Slayer.
- I'm not going anywhere.
|- I didn't expect you would adhere to that.
However, if you interfere with the new|watcher in any way, you will be dealt with.
- Are we clear?
|- We're very clear.
Congratulations again.
Bite me.
Yes, well Colourful girl.
I can't believe Giles was fired.
|How could Giles get fired?
So, how did you manage to kill Kralik?
She was very clever.
- You go ahead and tell it.
You tell it better.
|- When you say fired, do you mean fired?
You're not cruising past|that concept anytime soon, are ya?
Well, it's just I mean, he's been fired.
|He's he's unemployed.
He's between jobs.
Giles isn't going anywhere, Will.
|He's still librarian.
- OK, but I'm writing an angry letter.
|- Nothing's really gonna change.
The important thing is that I kept up my|birthday tradition of misery and horror.
Bright side to everything?
I'll just feel better when|I get my strength back.
Give you a hand with that, little lady?
You're loving this far too much.
Admit it.
Sometimes you|just need a big, strong man.
Will?
Give me a hand with that?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": You're fired.
Now!
I think that was the last.
- Will, are you OK?
|- Yeah, I'm fine.
The shaking is a side effect of the fear.
- Thank you.
|- If it wasn't for that clouding spell Yeah, it went good.
|Nothing melted like last time.
These babes were wicked rowdy.
|What's their deal?
I wish I knew.
Most of my sources have dried up since|the Council has relieved me of my duties.
I was aware that there was a nest here, but|I expected it to be vampires.
These are new.
- And improved.
|- Yes, well, I'm sorry.
I should've had you better prepared and|I should never have allowed Willow and Good.
We're fine.
Just a little bit dirty.
|Good show, everyone.
Just great.
- I think we have a hit.
|- Are you OK?
Tiptop.
Really.
If anyone sees my spine|layin' around, just try not to step on it.
- One of these days you're gonna get hurt.
|- Or killed.
Or both.
And, you know,|with the pain and then the death Maybe you shouldn't be leaping into the fray|like that.
Maybe you should be fray-adjacent.
Excuse me?
Who distracted the demon by|allowing her to pummel him about the head?
Yeah, that was real manly|how you shrieked an' all.
I think you'll find that was more of a bellow.
- What shall we do with the trio?
Burn them?
|- I brought marshmallows.
Occasionally I'm callous and strange.
We can leave them.
I'm more interested|in finding out what they are - and whether we can expect more of them.
|- I hope not.
They're way too fit.
I say bring 'em on.
Xander, I think in the future|perhaps it would be best if you hung back to the rear|of the battle.
For your own sake.
But gee, Mr White, if Clark and Lois get all|the good stories, I'll never be a good reporter.
Jimmy Olsen jokes are gonna be lost on you.
- Sorry.
|- It's OK.
Hey, Doug, toss me one.
Les, man, I'm open.
Les, buddy.
Doug, right here, man.
Right here.
Doug, please.
All right, it's all me.
Boy, I am so sorry.
Doug's arm is kinda like spaghetti.
|We're all so very sad for him.
- Is your lunch OK?
|- What are you, retarded?
No.
I took that test when I was seven - a little slow in some stuff, mostly math and|spatial relations, but certainly not challenged.
- Can I get you another soda?
|- I oughta cut your face open.
It was an accident.
Cool down.
You wanna be startin' somethin'?
What?
Starting something?
Like that Michael Jackson song, right?
|That was a lotta fun.
Too high to get over, yeah, yeah|Remember that fun song?
I get my buddies together, we're gonna|kick your ass till it's a brand new shape.
Now get outta here.
Yo, man, the ball!
Boy, of all the humiliations you've had|I've witnessed, that was the latest.
- I could've taken him.
|- Oh, please.
O'Toole would macramé|your face.
He is a psycho.
Which is still a lot cooler than being a wuss.
Why is it that I've come face to face with|the most hideous creatures hell ever spit out and I'm afraid of a bully like Jack O'Toole?
Because, unlike all those other creatures,|Jack actually noticed you were there.
Why am I surprised|by how comforting you're not?
It must be hard when|all your friends have superpowers - slayer, werewolf, witches, vampires -|and you're like this little nothing.
You must feel like Jimmy Olsen.
I was just talkin' to|Mind your own business.
I struck a nerve.
The boy that had no cool.
I happen to be an integral part of that group.
|I happen to have a lot to offer.
- Oh, please.
|- I do.
Integral part of the group?
Xander.
You're the useless part of the group.
|You're the Zeppo.
Cool.
Look it up.
It's something a subliterate that's repeated|12th grade three times has, and you don't.
There was no part of that that wasn't fun.
But it's just that it's buggin' me.
|This cool thing.
I mean what is it?
How do you get it?
Who doesn't have it?
|And who decides who doesn't have it?
What is the essence of "cool"?
Not sure.
I mean, you yourself, Oz, are considered|more or less cool.
Why is that?
- Am I?
|- Is it about the talking?
You know, the way you tend to express|yourself in short, noncommittal phrases?
- Could be.
|- No.
You're in a band.
That's like a business-class ticket to cool|with complimentary mojo after takeoff.
I gotta learn an instrument.
|Is it hard to play guitar?
- Not the way I play it.
|- On the other hand, eighth grade, I'm takin' flugelhorn and gettin' zero trim,|so the instrument thing could be a mislead.
But you need a thing.
One thing|nobody else has.
What do I have?
An exciting new obsession,|which I feel makes you very special.
Now with the mocking.
Which I can handle|because I know I'm right about this.
I'm on the track.
I just need to find my thing.
You're overthinkin' it.
|You got some identity issues.
It's not - The end of the world.
|- Can they do that?
They seem fairly committed.
The Sisterhood of Jhe.
|They're an apocalypse cult.
They exist solely to bring about|the world's destruction.
We've not seen the last of them.
|More will follow.
And they're here in Sunnydale|for what?
Demon Expo?
- Buffy, this is no laughing matter.
|- Hence my no laughing.
I'm sorry.
I know I'm no longer|your official watcher, but - Hey.
|- Hey.
You're cutting it a bit close.
Well, you know me.
- Well, do we know why they're here?
|- I think so.
Based on some artefacts|that I found with them and taking into account the current astral cycle Giles, I don't need to see the math.
They intend to open the Hellmouth.
The Hellmouth.
- The one that opens|- About 20ft from where you're standing.
And if it opens?
Remember the demon that|almost got out the night I died?
Every nightmare I have that isn't about|academic failure or public nudity is about that thing.
|In fact once I dreamt that it attacked me while I was late for a test and naked.
Well, it'll be the first to come out.
And Giles|says it won't be the worst by a long shot.
The world will be overrun|with demons if we don't stop it.
Do we know when this|is supposed to happen?
Giles is trying to narrow it down.
If you're up for it, we're heading|into deep research mode.
I'd be offended if you haven't|already counted me in.
Thanks, Will.
There's something about this one|that scares me.
I need my Willow.
You don't have to be afraid.
You girls need a lift?
What is this?
What do you mean, what is it?
It's my thing.
- Your thing?
|- My thing.
Is this a penis metaphor?
It's my thing that makes me cool.
|That makes me unique.
- I'm Car Guy.
Guy with a car.
|- How can you afford it?
Uncle Roary stacked up the DUIs,|let me rent this bad boy till he's mobile again.
- Well, it's nice.
|- Could you sound a little less enthused?
- Sorry.
|- Evil.
- Big?
|- Biggest.
Maybe more than I can handle.
Then we'll handle it together.
|You know I'm here for you.
Just tell me what I can do.
I'll take two glazed, two cinnamon,|a couple of cream-filled and a jelly.
- No, let's round that out to four jellies.
|- Is some evil going on?
Must be big for them to entrust you|with this daredevil mission.
Cordelia.
Feel free to drop dead|of a wasting disease in the next 20 seconds.
Again I strike the nerve.
|I am the surgeon of mean.
- I'm kinda busy now, OK?
|- Right.
Buffy needs your help.
- Can you say "expendable"?
|- You think you know everything.
- I think I know you.
|- That's a laugh.
What, you got a shiny car|and now you're someone new?
- Like anybody even cares about|- Is that your car?
Why - Yes, it is.
|- '5l Chevy Bel Air.
Fuel-injected V8?
- Very possibly.
|- How does she handle?
Like a dream about warm, sticky things.
- Would you like to go for a little drive?
|- You busy?
Just gotta drop this stuff off, and then|I would describe myself as expendable.
Come on.
There.
And then I started seeing Dave Peck.
|He had a Thunderbird.
Engine completely tricked out,|but the upholstery was kinda shot.
Then I started seeing Mike.
Not Mike with the|Mercedes, Mike with the Mustang.
An '82 V6.
- You know|- Angel.
Buddy.
Friend buddy.
|You wanna sit and talk?
- I'm lookin' for Buffy.
|- Library, last I saw.
- Something's happening.
I've seen portents.
|- The apocalypse.
They're on top of it.
- They don't know what they're dealing with.
|- Let's go there and tell them that.
No, it's best you stay outta harm's way.
But I can help.
You wanna go for another drive?
It's not like I haven't helped before.
I've done some quality violence for those|people.
Do they even think about that?
I mean they act like I'm some sort of klutz.
Oh, God.
Are you all right?
Oh, God Stay calm.
Little fender-bender.
It's not the end of the world.
He's cranky.
It's a good night for it.
Can't dogs sense when there's|an earthquake?
And they bark?
Or cows lie down or something?
"Sisterhood of Jhe.
Race|of female demons, fierce warriors" "Celebrate victory in battle|by eating their foes".
- They couldn't pour Gatorade on each other?
|- The Council won't take my calls.
Idiots.
- Anything useful in the books?
|- Not wildly.
We still have the Books of Pherion|to go through.
I'm getting itchy feet.
If we don't turn up|something soon, I'm gonna check out Willy's.
- Fine.
|- Where are you going?
To try and contact the spirit guides that exist|out of time and have knowledge of the future.
I have no idea if they'll respond|to my efforts, but I have to try.
All we know is that the fate of the entire|world rests on Did you eat all the jellies?
Did you want a jelly?
I always have a jelly.
I'm the one|that says "let's have a jelly in the mix".
We're sorry.
Buffy had three.
- No matter.
If Xander makes another run|- No.
Xander's out of this.
He nearly got killed last time.
|This would be easier if we know he's safe.
Gosh, Jack.
Are you OK?
I am really sorry about that.
|Your car came outta nowhere.
- I was parked.
|- Exactly.
Look, I can cover the damages.
I don't have insurance in the strictest sense|but I have a little money.
The important thing is that we're all right and|we can work this out like two reasonable - frontiersmen.
|- Where do you want it?
- What?
|- Where do you want it?
I'm fairly certain I don't want it at all.
|But thank you.
Cool knife.
Yeah.
Great knife.
Although I think it may|technically be a sword.
She's called Katie.
You gave it a girl's name.
|How very serial killer of you.
Lysette, I think we should be going.
- Are you scared?
|- Would that make you happy?
Your woman lookin' on|and you can't stand up to me?
Don't you feel pathetic?
Mostly I feel Katie.
You know what the difference|between you and me is?
Again Katie's springin' to mind.
Fear.
Who has the least fear.
And it has nothing to do|with who has the big, sharp Come on.
I wanna go for a drive.
I'm bored.
Gee, I'm really sorry my life-and-death|situation isn't exciting enough for you.
Hey!
- What's goin' on?
|- Nothin'.
Just rasslin'.
O'Toole.
What a surprise.
He attack you?
No.
Just blowin' off steam.
Two guys rasslin'.
But not in a gay way.
Do it somewhere else, huh?
- What?
|- That was all right.
You could've narked on me, didn't do it.
That's decent of ya.
I like you.
- Yay?
|- You two wanna have some fun?
- Like, with driving?
|- Yeah.
- What do you have in mind?
|- I was on my way to get the boys.
Gonna cruise around.
- We'll take your wheels.
|- What about your car?
It ain't mine.
- Great.
Where to?
|- Gonna get the boys.
Yeah.
So where are the boys?
He calls forth the spirit|of Uurthu, the Restless.
No one shall speak.
He shall arise.
Hear me.
The blood of the earth shall restore him.
And he shall arise.
He shall arise.
- Buddy.
|- Bob.
You big hideous corpse.
Come here.
I'll call ya.
Man!
You raised me!
I told you Grandpappy could work that mojo.
|Big Bob is back in action.
Yes!
Man!
I can't believe you raised me.
|That is so awesome.
- You are the coolest.
|- Maybe I should just let you guys catch up.
Bob, this is Xander.
He's our wheel man.
Hey.
Howdy.
- Where are the other guys?
We gotta get 'em.
|- Absolutely.
Are all your friends dead?
- Xander, let's roll.
|- How long I been down?
- Eight months.
|- I got some catchin' up to do.
- Walker, Texas Ranger, You been taping 'em?
|- Every ep.
All right.
We're gonna get|the guys together and party.
This is gonna be a night to remember.
Yeah!
I'm sensin' that.
The blood of the earth shall|restore him, and he shall arise.
Dudes!
Giles.
Hey.
What's goin' on?
Just trying to gain access to the spirit guides.
Not going very well, I'm afraid.
- What are you doing here?
|- We were just raising some heck.
Xander!
Let's go!
Listen, do you guys need any help?
No, thank you.
Probably best|if you stay out of trouble.
- No chance of that.
|- Xander!
Motor!
There's something different|about this menace.
Something in the air.
- The stench of death.
|- Yeah.
I think it's Bob.
We may all be called upon|to fight when it happens.
- When what happens, exactly?
|- Come on!
I'd better go.
Hopefully we should have time|to prepare.
All we need is a few weeks.
- Tonight?
|- Before sunrise.
That's what they said.
- Why did they do this?
|- They were looking for Angel.
- Angel?
Why?
|- They said they were comin' after you too.
Nothing could stand in their way|because tonight was the night.
- Man!
|- The ambulance is on its way.
Look, kid, my clientele ain't exactly|nuns and orphans, but I - I never seen anything like these demons.
|- I'm gonna stop them.
If that Hellmouth opens, they're gonna be the least|of your problems is my train of thought.
If I were you, I'd go find Angel, go somewhere quiet together.
I'd be thinkin' about how I wanna|spend my last night on Earth.
Let's get some beers!
Let's go pick up some girls.
We'll hang out at|Taco Bell, get some girls, go cruise around - I wanna bake a cake.
|- We need some beers though.
I can't believe you got shot, man.
|Was it them Jackals?
Are you kiddin'?
We wiped them out|after they threw you off the bridge.
Man, you guys are the best, man.
|You're the best.
I mean that.
There's a liquor store.
|A little Armenian guy runs the place.
He's got a gun behind the counter.
Hey We should go kick his ass.
If you guys want me to drop you off - Nah, you're with us now.
|- You're on the team now, baby.
What are we gonna do?
I've heard some interesting suggestions, but|I'm gonna go with Dickie's.
Let's bake a cake.
All right.
You stay here|and keep the motor runnin'.
This time of night|I'm pretty sure nothing's open.
But they're always open for crime.
OK.
Now I'm involved in crime.
I'm the criminal element.
|Havin' a car sure is cool.
- Thank you.
Sorry to wake you.
|- No problem.
Will.
Xander.
What are you doin' here?
Nothing.
Certainly not crime.
|What about you?
I needed supplies for a protection spell.
Buffy|called from Angel's.
It's happening tonight.
- And that thing that's happening would be?
|- I can't stay.
Buffy'll need this.
I love you, Xander.
- OK, that's it.
I'm gonna|- Where you goin'?
- Look, something's just come up.
|- You gonna bail on me?
Is that it?
- We got the cake mix.
|- Where you wanna bake it?
- Xander's lookin' to leave.
|- No way.
We need a wheel man.
- Xander doesn't feel like part of the group.
|- I'm kinda busy.
He doesn't feel like part of the group|because he hasn't been initiated.
- Do you think he's ready?
|- Well, I think he's earned his stripes.
I say we let him in, boys.
Great.
I wanna be in the gang, sure.
- All right.
Yeah.
|- That's the spirit.
What do I gotta do?
You gotta die.
All right, guys.
Let's just talk about this.
Now, you wanna be part|of the gang, don't you?
Yes, yes.
But I'm not dying to be|in the gang, if you get the pun there.
What, you're too good to be dead?
You got a problem with dead people?
What about Jack?
Jack's not dead.
- Drive-by three weeks ago.
|- Oh, boy.
Grandpappy found my body.
I wasn't gone|but ten minutes before he raised me.
- It's a rush, man.
|- Let's kill Xander.
It'll be fun.
You can be a full-fledged member.
Come on, Xander.
Take it like a man.
All right, enough!
You guys have had|your fun, but you forgot about one thing.
Get him!
Damn!
There goes the wheels.
- He took all our stuff, man.
|- I wanna bake a cake.
It's all right.
We'll get more.
|The night is young.
That's enough excitement for one evening.
Get in!
- Think Demon Mama followed us?
|- No, we're cool.
The bitch dislocated my shoulder though.
Hold me.
That's better.
She got me really wound up.
A fight like that and no kill I'm about ready to pop.
Really?
- Pop?
|- You up for it?
I'm up.
I'm suddenly very up.
It's just I've never been|up with people before.
Just relax.
Take your pants off.
Those two concepts are antithetical.
Don't worry.
I'll steer you round the curves.
Did I mention that I'm having|a very strange night?
That was great.
I gotta shower.
- I've never seen him like this.
|- The Hellmouth.
He senses it's gonna open.
- Now don't hesitate.
|- Do it.
Now, Oz Again!
We'd better move him before he wakes up.
Sorry.
I hope you're not|mad at me in the morning.
Hey.
They're not baking any cake.
Long gone.
Probably loaded|with supplies.
Gotta think.
I can't believe I had sex.
OK, bombs.
Already-dead guys with bombs.
Man, I'm outta my league.
Buffy'll know what to do.
- I don't know what to do.
|- Then let me decide for you.
- I can face this thing.
|- You can't.
Look, I can at least buy you enough time|for Willow's spell to bind it.
Buffy, this is worse|than anything we've ever faced.
Hey, it's the only way.
I can't watch you die again.
I love you.
- I love you.
|- Nothing can change that.
- Not even death.
|- Don't talk to me like that.
You may be ready to go,|but I am not ready to lose you.
OK, this is my fight, and if you|won't do it my way then you're Hey.
I've got this There's this This is probably a bad time.
Can I help?
OK.
OK, I can work this out.
I just gotta figure out|what they'd be likely to bomb.
OK, Oz is moved.
He could barely walk after that|Mickey I gave him, but we made it.
- Is he gonna be all right there?
|- Anywhere's safer than here.
Help me with the candles.
We're doing the spell|from the Hebron's Almanac?
Yes.
Once it's ready you're to stay back|and let me finish the recitation.
Don't argue.
I want you safe.
Who knows what's gonna|come up from beneath us?
This is gonna be large.
Giles'll know what to do.
|He's way more calm than Buffy.
OK, I got a plan.
Hey, our wheels.
Hey!
- Come on, man!
Stop!
|- Where's the bomb?
- It's in the high school.
|- In the school where?
Oh, God!
This really, really hurts.
It's in the boiler room.
All right.
Now I'm gonna ask you this once,|and you better pray you get the answer right.
How do I defuse?
I probably should've left out|that whole middle part.
He's headed for the school.
- There he is!
|- Where's a slayer when you need one?
Oh, my God.
It's grown.
There he is!
Come on!
Get him!
Hey, stop!
Come on, man!
.
Which way?
He couldn't have gotten far.
Let's split up.
Good for chopping.
Now this is what I call fun.
You should've learned by now, if you play|with fire you gotta expect sooner or later I wasn't finished.
Note to self: less talk.
Faith, go for the heart!
OK.
Boiler room.
Other way.
Hello, Nasty.
Less than two minutes.
Dumb guy, little bomb How hard can it be?
- It just got harder.
|- I'm not leavin' till that thing's disarmed.
Then I guess you're not leavin'.
I'm gonna carve you up|and serve you with gravy.
You pissed me off, boy.
|Now you pay the price.
First the eyes, then the tongue,|then I'll break every one of your fingers.
You gonna do all that in 49 seconds?
I know what you're thinkin'.
|Can I get by him, up the stairs, out of the building, seconds ticking away?
- I don't love your chances.
|- Then you'll die too.
Yeah, looks like.
So I guess the question|really is who has less fear?
I'm not afraid to die.
I'm already dead.
Yeah, but this is different.
Being blowed up isn't|"drinkin' with your buddies" dead.
It's "little bits bein' swept up by a janitor"|dead, and I don't think you're ready for that.
Are you?
I like the quiet.
Now, Buffy!
Good boy.
I don't think I wanna be seeing you|on campus any more, Jack.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Harris.
|The first time you turn your back Even after the Hellmouth was closed|we could still hear it screaming.
But Angel's gonna be OK?
He was only out for a few minutes.
|Longest of my life.
I'll never forget that thing's face.
|Its real face, I mean.
Yes.
I don't know how you managed to It was the bravest thing I've ever seen.
The stupidest.
But the world continues to turn.
No one will ever know|how close it came to stopping.
Never know what we did.
Guys.
Xander.
Boy, you're lucky you weren't|at school last night.
It was crazed.
Well, give me the quiet life.
I'm gonna grab a snack.
Anyone want?
- Oz?
|- No, I'm oddly full today.
OK.
Look, it's Mr Excitement.
On another life-or-death doughnut mission,|or just cruising for bimbos again?
Giving them lessons in lack of cool.
What?
What?
What?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- So, what, you're telling me never?
|- Faith, now is not the time.
I'm curious.
Never ever?
Come on, really.
All this time,|and not even once?
How many times do I have to say it?
|I have never done it with Xander.
He's just a friend.
So?
What are friends for?
|I mean, I'm sorry.
It's just All this sweating nightly action, and|you never put in for a little after-hours Thanks for the poetry.
And no.
I love Xander, I just don't love Xander.
|I think it ruins friendships to do that stuff.
- You think too much.
|- Hey.
There's one more.
- How do you know?
|- I think too much.
OK.
On the count of three.
One Three.
- Nicely diverted, B!
|- Diverted?
That was me fighting for my life.
This isn't a Tupperware party.
|It's hard to plan.
The count of three isn't a plan.
|It's Sesame Street, Hey, they're toast and we're here,|so it couldn't have been too bad.
Who were those guys, anyways?
I don't know.
They didn't seem local.
Look, why don't we grab|the weapons?
Maybe Giles Check these out.
I just love "The Family Circus".
That PJ.
He's gettin' to be quite a handful.
Well!
I haven't seen anything like this in|well, a good long while.
Where's the owner of these fine implements?
The common term is "slain".
But I've been seeing this breed around.
|Are we expecting any trouble?
- Do you like "Family Circus"?
|- I like "Marmaduke".
He's always on the furniture.
Unsanitary.
Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do.
|That's my kinda dog.
I like to read "Cathy".
So, what about these swords?
|Wh-What should we do about that?
Let's just keep an eye out.
|We've got the dedication in a few days.
We certainly can't have|anything interfering with that.
Well, maybe we should|postpone the dedication.
I believe the Honourable Mayor|hates that idea.
The dedication is the final step|before my Ascension.
I have waited longer than|you can imagine for this.
After the hundred days,|I'll be on a higher plane.
And I'll have no more need for Well, let's just say I won't be|concerned with the little things.
Mr Trick, watch these people.
|Anything you find out about them Well, let's just see that|that information reaches the slayers.
Who knows?
With any luck, they'll kill|each other.
Then everyone's a winner.
Everyone, of course, being me.
- Willow, what are these?
|- Early admission packets.
Harvard Yale Wesleyan Some German polytechnical institute|whose name I can't pronounce.
Is anyone else intimidated?
|I'm expecting slips of paper - with the words "no way" written in crayon.
|- They're typing those now.
I'm so overwhelmed.
I got in.
|To actual colleges.
And they're wooing me.
- They're pitching woo.
|- The wooing stage is always fun.
But it's weird.
Rejection I can handle|cos of the years of training.
- But this|- I feel your pain, Will.
I'm torn between the fast-growing fields|of appliance repair and motel management.
Of course, I'm still waitin' to hear back|from the Corn Dog Emporium, so I think it's great.
Now nothing stands|between you and your brilliant future.
Well, if I may suggest, graduate.
Gettin' left back?
|Not the thrill ride you'd expect.
That's so cute, planning life as a loser.
Most people just turn out that way,|but you're really taking charge.
The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia Chase,|who won't be needing a higher education when she markets|her own line of hookerwear.
Well, Xander, I could|dress more like you but Oh.
My father has a job.
I won't waste the perfect comeback now,|but don't think I don't have it.
Oh, yes.
Its time will come.
So, life beyond high school.
Anyone.
Please, chime in.
I hear it's nice.
And a place I'll never go|if I don't pass Mrs Taggart's chemistry test.
I can help.
Chemistry's easy.
|It's a lot like witchcraft, only less newt.
So, what do you say?
|Study jam, my house, tonight?
I'm there.
I have to go see Giles,|report on last night's patrol.
- Oh, yeah.
He said he wanted to talk to you.
|- What about?
Is he OK?
He's looked better.
Of course, training procedures have been|updated quite a bit since your day.
- Much greater emphasis on field work.
|- Really?
Oh, yes.
Not all books and theory nowadays.
I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself.
|Under controlled circumstances, of course.
- You're in no danger of finding those here.
|- Vampires?
Controlled circumstances.
Hello, Buffy.
Well Hello.
New watcher?
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
It's very nice to meet you.
- Is he evil?
|- Evil?
- The last one was evil.
|- Oh, yes.
Gwendolyn Post.
We all heard.
No, Mr Giles has checked my credentials,|rather thoroughly, and phoned the Council.
But I'm glad to see|you're on the ball as well.
A good slayer is a cautious slayer.
- Is he evil?
|- Not in the strictest sense.
Well, I'm glad that's cleared up.
As I'm sure none of us is anxious|to waste any time on pleasantries, why don't you tell me everything|about last night's patrol?
- Vampires.
|- Yes?
- Killed 'em.
|- Anything else you can tell me?
One of them had swords.
|I don't think he was with the other two.
Swords?
- One long, one short?
|- Both pointy.
With, like, jewels and things.
- Sounds familiar.
|- It should.
- "El Eliminati".
|- Fifteenth-century duellist cult.
Deadly in their day, their numbers dwindled due to an increase in antivampire activity|and a lot of pointless duelling.
They became the acolytes|of a demon called Balthazar, who brought them to the New World -|specifically, here.
- You seem to know a lot about them.
|- I didn't get this job because of my looks.
I really, really believe that.
I've researched this town's|history, extensively.
- So why have we not seen them before this?
|- They were driven out 100 years ago.
Happily, Balthazar was killed.
|I don't know by whom.
And they're back cos?
Balthazar had an amulet,|purported to give him strength.
When he was killed, it was taken|by a wealthy landowner named - I don't want to bore you.
|- A bit late.
..
named Gleaves.
It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati|are looking for it, for sentimental value.
You don't think this amulet poses any threat?
Oh, no.
Not at all.
Nonetheless,|we may as well keep it from them.
Buffy, you will go to the Gleaves|family crypt and fetch the amulet.
- I will?
|- Are you not used to being given orders?
Whenever Giles sends me on a mission,|he always says "please".
And afterwards, I get a cookie.
I don't feel we're getting off|on quite the right foot.
This is perhaps Faith?
New watcher?
Screw that.
Now, why didn't I just say that?
- Buffy, would you|- I'll see if I can get her back.
Don't say anything incredibly|interesting while I'm gone.
They'll get used to me.
Faith, wait.
Look, I know|this new guy's a dork, but - I have nothing to follow that.
He's a dork.
|- You're gonna take orders from him?
- That's the job.
What else can we do?
|- Whatever we want.
We're slayers, girlfriend.
The Chosen Two.
|Why let him take all the fun out of it?
That'd be tragic, taking the fun|out of slaying, stabbing, beheading.
- Oh, like you don't dig it.
|- I don't.
You're a liar.
I've seen you.
Tell me staking|a vamp doesn't get you a little bit juiced.
Come on, say it.
You can't fool me.
The look|in your eyes after a kill?
- You just get hungry for more.
|- You're way off-base.
Tell me that, if you don't|get in a good slaying, you start itching for some vamp to show up|so you can give him a good Again with the grunting.
|I'm not comfortable with this.
Slaying's what we were built for.
If you're not|enjoying it, you're doing something wrong.
- What about the assignment?
|- You do the homework, and I'll copy yours.
Strike one.
No amulet there.
Game over.
- Faith.
|- What are you doing, hiding in there?
Looking for the amulet.
|Wasn't counting on the guest stars.
Six against one.
Hence the hiding.
Well, it's six against two now, so come on.
- Wait.
Stop.
Think.
|- No, no, no.
It's a manhole.
Tight space,|no escape, six against two.
- Three against one.
|- Maybe more.
Come on.
- Just go down there?
That's your plan?
|- Who said I had a plan?
I don't know how many's down there,|but I'll know when I land.
If you don't come in after me, I might die.
- These are all the diaries, yours included?
|- That's everything.
Knock yourself out.
Please?
Oh, yes.
Here's your first entry: "Slayer is wilful and insolent".
- That would be our girl, wouldn't it?
|- You have to get to know her.
"Her abuse of the English language is such|that I understand only every other sentence".
- This is going to make fascinating reading.
|- She should be back by now.
Not to fret.
My mission scenario has her|back in one minute.
Shouldn't be any trouble.
- We're surrounded.
|- You noticed that too?
Let's settle this honourably.
Then let's just settle it.
Buffy!
You son of a bitch.
I hate it when they drown me.
B!
Gotta go!
We came for the amulet.
Tell me you don't get off on this.
Didn't suck.
Looks authentic enough.
Of course, there are tests|to be made before verification.
How about verifying that your nearly extinct|cult was out in magnum force last night?
- We got into a serious party situation.
|- Are you all right?
I had to lather, rinse and repeat about five|million times but otherwise I'm of the good.
Thank you for asking.
Perhaps there are more than anticipated,|but I'd expect you to be ready.
Remember the three key|words for any slayer: preparation, preparation, preparation.
That's one word three times.
I have a chem test.
So sad that I'm actually happy|about that.
Giles, we need to talk.
Buffy I must ask you to remember|that I am your watcher.
From now on, anything you have to say|about slaying, you will say to me.
The only thing you need discuss|with Mr Giles is overdue book fees.
Understood?
- We'll talk.
|- Of course.
- You're not helping.
|- I know.
I feel just sick about it.
It was intense.
It was like|I just let go and became this force.
- I just didn't care any more.
|- Yeah, I know what that's like.
I don't think you can.
|It's kind of a slayer thing.
- I'm not explaining it well.
|- You're explaining it a lot, though.
You have one period to|fill out your test booklets.
Periodic charts are located on the back, and|you're on the honour system, so no talking.
Faith knew I didn't want to go down there Miss Summers?
You have one hour.
- OK.
So the best part|- Buffy Test?
You know.
Remember?
The thing|you didn't come over to study for?
Right.
Got it.
Sorry.
So we're in the sewers,|and Faith's got three of them on her Whoa.
Can we resume|Buffy's ode to Faith later?
Like when I'm not|actively multiple-choicing?
How come your eye twitches|every time I say Faith's name?
What?
No, it doesn't.
Faith.
Cut it out.
We got a test to take, OK?
I'm highly caffeinated,|and I'm trying to concentrate.
Some of us actually care|about school, you know.
Hey, girlfriend.
Bad time?
No, she can't.
You can't, can you?
- What's up?
|- Vampires.
Unless there's an eclipse|in the next five minutes, it's daylight.
- Good for us, bad for them.
I found a nest.
|- That has potential.
- Rise and shine, people.
|- This is your wake-up call.
Hey.
You're not leaving, are you?
- I saw you making friends.
|- Them?
Boys.
I like you, What's the matter?
You're not|afraid of little me, are you?
We'd better sit down.
Come on.
I can sense this is a business trip.
- What's the what?
|- Balthazar.
- Dead demon.
|- Not as dead as you think.
Word has it he's in a warehouse|on Devereau.
He's looking for His amulet.
To restore his strength.
From what I hear,|that's not something we'd like.
- No problem.
We got the amulet.
|- Giles said you gave it to someone.
- There you are.
|- Wow, speak of the really annoying person.
You're certainly giving me|a run for my money.
I think that if you're going to go out slaying,|you leave a number where I can contact you.
Where's the amulet?
- Who are you?
|- A friend.
Do you have it?
It's somewhere safe.
- How did you know?
|- It pooches your jacket.
- Hang on.
|- Carrying this is like wearing a target.
You'll put it somewhere safe|that's actually safe?
- I'll do it now.
|- I'll do some recon on Balthazar.
If I may.
Balthazar is dead.
|Am I the only one that remembers that?
- Be careful.
|- You know me.
I mean it.
What's going on?
Call me.
Let me tell you what I see.
I see fear.
And remorse.
And the pitiful look of faces|that cry out for mercy.
But what I don't see is what I want to see, and that's my amulet!
Lord Balthazar.
We found it.
- We had it.
But the slayers|- Already I'm bored.
Vincent.
Come here.
Closer.
Closer.
Let me tell you what I want to see.
OK, we got 10, maybe 12 bad guys, and one big demon in|desperate need of a StairMaster.
I say we take 'em all, hard and fast, now.
We need more firepower than none.
|We should head back to the library.
Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going|anywhere.
I just wish we had That is too good.
Score.
- Think they're insured?
|- Strangely, not my priority.
When are you gonna get this, B?
|The life of a slayer's very simple.
Want?
Take.
Have.
Want.
Take.
Have.
I'm gettin' it.
Drop the weapons and get|down on the ground.
Now!
I said drop the weapons, or I fire.
- Now spread 'em.
|- You wish.
Hands in the air where I can see 'em.
Slow.
Good.
Now cuff 'em.
I like him.
He's butch.
That's some artillery you two are puttin'|together.
You with one of them girl gangs?
Yeah.
We're the Slayers.
You wanna get outta here?
Can't save the world in jail.
One, two - We should call an ambulance.
|- People already have, the racket we made.
Come on.
Let's get outta here.
Come on!
Admit it.
Some days don't you wanna just|wake up and say "To hell with the diet"?
Wanna make waffles?
Big Saturday brunch?
No, thanks.
I'm not really that hungry.
So what did you and Faith do last night?
Nothing.
Nothing really important.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna|meddle in your slaying.
- Just as long as you're careful.
|- I am.
You sure about those waffles?
Yeah.
But if you want them,|I can help you make them.
No.
They only don't have calories|if I make 'em for you.
Mom logic.
Are you done with the paper?
- Yeah.
|- Let's see what's happening in Sunnydale.
There we go.
Thanks a lot, fellas.
Thanks a heap.
Hey, have fun|on that camping trip, now.
Don't forget to roast a wiener for me.
There you go.
All right,|you can come out now.
Backbone of America, those little guys.
Seeing the hope and courage on their bright|little faces, I swear I could just eat 'em up.
So, any news about the Eliminati?
In the name of Lord Balthazar, die!
Thank you, Mr Trick.
Very thoughtful of you.
Why do they always gotta be using swords?
It's called a Uzi, chump.
|Woulda saved your ass right about now.
You know, it's curious how he could have|gotten all the way into my liquor cabinet.
Allan, don't we have security|working in this building?
Sir, I had no idea.
There's no need to swoon, Allan,|but try to keep things secure.
Lock him up.
He wake up, he's just gonna|try and kill you again.
Yes.
Yes, I expect he will.
Vincent made a noble effort.
Man to man, as befits a true warrior.
He had courage.
He had honour.
And I have jack to show for it!
It has been a hundred years|since my enemy crippled me.
Now ultimate power is within his grasp, and I shall not let it be.
Forget about honour!
Forget about everything|but getting my amulet!
Bring the watchers to me!
|Find the slayers and kill them!
Kill everything that gets in your way!
Go!
Go!
- You like it?
|- It smells good.
What is it?
Just a little something we witches|like to call a "protection spell".
Good deal, protection.
I'm surprised,|though, cos usually spell stuff's more Stinky.
Yeah, that's why I added lavender.
Give me time, and I may be the first wicca|to do all my conjuring in pine-fresh scent.
So, what's the plan?
For tonight's slayage.
We're going, aren't we?
- Yeah.
|- Great.
But there's a "but".
And that's|but you shouldn't come tonight.
Is that cool?
Sure.
Makes sense.
You know, you'll be|facing big, hairy danger.
Biggest.
Very hairy.
- You'll be risking your life.
|- Right.
- And why risk yours?
|- Because I'm your friend.
I know, Will, and that's exactly why|I don't want you going.
It's too dangerous.
But I've done this sort of thing before.
Like,|a million times.
I can totally handle myself.
Besides, minty-fresh protection.
So?
Ready?
Time to motor.
Hey, Willow.
Hi.
I really should - But we'll hang out later, right?
|- Yeah.
You go ahead.
I'll just get my stuff.
Stupid.
- You're quiet tonight.
|- I just wanna get this done.
I'm dying to test out the longbow.
- I think it might be my new thing.
|- I can't believe you went back for it.
How about getting|some ribs after we're done?
I didn't say you had emotional problems.
I said an emotional problem.
|It's quite different.
My attachment to the Slayer is not a problem.
|In fact, it's been a very useful The way you've handled this|is an embarrassment to the Council.
If you want to criticise my methods, fine.
But keep your snide remarks to yourself.
|And don't criticise my methods.
The fact is you're no longer|qualified to act as watcher.
It's not your fault.
You've done well.
It's simply time for|somebody else to take the field.
Now's a good time to start.
Screw it.
We got more comin'.
- We'll never make it to the warehouse.
|- If they come one at a time, we got a shot.
Faith, no!
- Don't move.
|- I didn't I didn't know.
- I didn't know.
|- We need to call 911.
Now!
Don't move.
It's OK.
I need something to stop the We gotta go.
Come on!
We gotta go!
Come on.
- Angel.
|- Buffy.
I've been looking for you.
- Your hand.
|- It's OK.
I've just been to the warehouse.
|I was waitin' for you.
They got Giles.
The front, the front.
Moisten the front.
Oh, God.
- Doesn't seem too promising, does it?
|- Stay calm, Mr Giles.
We have to stay calm.
Thank God you're here.
|I was planning to panic.
What is that thing?
That would be your demon.
|You know, the dead one?
There's no need to get snippy.
Bring them closer.
You know what I want.
If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach|areas, I'd like to request you kill me now.
Are you insane?
This is|hardly the time for games.
Why not?
They'll torture us to death anyway.
- He's not wrong about that.
|- Now hold on.
We can deal with this rationally.
We have something you want.
|You have something we want.
A trade.
Intriguing.
No.
Wait.
Boring.
Pull off his kneecaps!
No!
The Slayer gave it|to someone.
A tall man.
A friend of hers.
I can tell you everything.
- Be quiet.
They'll kill us both.
|- But I'd like to have my kneecaps.
You will tell us everything!
Yes, sir.
What is this friend's name?
- I didn't actually catch it.
|- Look.
Tell you what.
Let him go, and I'll tell you what|you need to know.
How's that deal?
There is one deal!
You will die quickly,|or you will die slowly!
The man who has my amulet!
What is his name?
His name is Angel.
Unacceptable!
Unacceptable!
- Mr Giles?
|- Down!
Slayer.
You think you've won.
When he rises, you'll wish I'd killed you all.
Potestatem matris nostrae|in tenebris invoco, Maledictum filium tuum ab omni periculo|custodias nunc et in saecula!
I don't understand why Allan would|miss this.
He's usually so punctual.
- Did it work?
|- Let's find out.
Open the cage.
- You sure?
|- Hold on.
OK.
Now we're ready.
Well!
This officially commences the hundred days.
Nothing can harm me until the Ascension.
Gosh, I'm feeling chipper.
Who's for a root beer?
Faith?
It's me.
So, I - How are you doin'?
|- I'm all right.
You know me.
We need to talk about what we're gonna do.
There's nothing to talk about.
|I was doing my job.
Being a slayer is not|the same as being a killer.
Faith, please don't shut me out here.
Sooner|or later, we're both gonna have to deal.
- Wrong.
|- We can help each other.
I don't need it.
Yeah?
Who's wrong now?
You can shut off|all the emotions that you want, but eventually they're gonna find a body.
OK.
This is the last time we're gonna|have this conversation.
You understand me?
There is no body.
I took it, weighted it|and dumped it.
The body doesn't exist.
Getting rid of the evidence|doesn't make the problem go away.
It does for me.
Faith, you don't get it.
You killed a man.
No, you don't get it.
I don't care.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": I have recommended to the Council that you be relieved of your duties|as watcher immediately.
You're fired.
- Hello.
|- New watcher?
- New watcher.
|- Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
Slaying's what we were built for.
|If you're not enjoying it, something's wrong.
Want.
Take.
Have.
I'm gettin' it.
Faith, no!
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
- They'll find a body.
|- There is no body.
I took it, weighted it and dumped it.
Faith, you don't get it.
You killed a man.
No, you don't get it.
I don't care.
We go live to our field reporter, who is at the waterfront|with this breaking news about the murder that has shocked|the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale, Fishermen discovered the body|today, the victim of a brutal stabbing, Everyone was shocked when the slain man|was identified as Deputy Mayor, Allan Finch, Still reeling from the news,|Mayor Wilkins had this to say: Mr Finch was not only|my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend, I promise you, I will not rest until whoever|did this is found and brought to justice, Thank you very much, Honey, you're up.
It's just terrible, isn't it?
I want you to look into this.
Find out all you|can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor.
But that's I mean, that's not really|our jurisdiction, is it?
- It's no big, B. We'll get into it if he wants.
|- No.
Buffy's right.
The Deputy Mayor's murder was caused by|human malice.
Nothing supernatural about it.
We don't know that for certain.
|I say it merits investigation.
Which I'm sure the police are doing.
In the meantime, if you ask me,|there are better uses for the slayers' time.
But I don't believe I did ask you.
Considering the success|of your previous adventure Don't let me interrupt.
|Wait.
Let me interrupt.
I'm in a hurry.
- What did you need?
|- Psych class.
Freud and Jung.
Book me?
Happily.
Check out Giles, the next generation.
|What's your deal?
I Well - I'm|- New watcher.
- Does everybody know about you?
|- She's a friend.
Let's not exaggerate.
So you're the new watcher.
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce.
I like a man with two last names.
I'm Cordelia.
- And you teach psychology?
|- I take psychology.
- She's a student.
|- Well Yes.
In fact, I am here to watch.
Girls.
Buffy and Faith, to be specific.
Well, it's about time|we got some fresh blood around here.
Well, fresh.
Yes.
- Here we go.
|- Thanks.
So, welcome to Sunnydale.
My.
She's cheeky, isn't she?
First word, "jail", second word, "bait".
Well, where were we?
Done.
I mean, we were done, right?
Yep.
Off to patrol.
So we'll see ya.
One moment, girls.
I am your commander now and,|on the matter of this murder, I am resolved.
"Natural" or "super", I want to know.
Fine by me.
Always ready|to kick a little bad guy butt.
So, you gonna rat me out?
Is that it?
Faith, we have to tell.
I can't pretend to|investigate this.
I can't pretend I don't know.
But you can pretend Angel's dead|when you need to protect him.
I am trying to protect you.
If we don't do the right thing,|it'll make things worse for you.
Worse than jail for the rest|of my young life?
No way.
- What we did was|- Yeah.
We.
You were there beside me|when this thing went down.
Anything I have to answer for, you do too.
You're a part of this, B. All the way.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
Where's Faith?
I saw her around.
Figured you two were gonna|go kill some more nasty stuff.
Not right now.
I think she bailed.
- Will, I|- Actually, I You go ahead.
I'm late.
I'm meeting Michael, the warlock guy.
We're still tryin' to "de-rat" Amy.
OK.
So, see ya.
See ya.
So you heard the man scream|about what time last night?
I'm not sure.
Seven.
Maybe eight.
Can you be more specific?
|Say, between seven-thirty and eight?
- Your hand.
|- It's OK.
It's not working.
It does something besides shred?
It's supposed to cheer me up!
Usually,|using the shredder gives me a lift.
It's fun.
- And today you're not gettin' the ya-yas.
|- No.
It'll take more than this|to turn my frown upside down.
I just don't understand why Allan would|leave such a paper trail about our dealings.
Do you think he was gonna betray me?
|Now that's a horrible thought.
And now he's dead,|I'll never have the chance to scold him.
Maybe this'll change your mood.
- What is it?
|- A bombshell.
The Deputy Mayor had|wooden splinters in his wound.
Struck right through the heart|with a sharp, pointed object.
Word is, someone was fighting vampires|not a block away from the scene.
The smart money says|it was a slayer who did this job.
What, do you think he talked?
To them?
If he did,|I'm thinkin' he said the wrong thing.
Well, this is exciting.
The Slayer up for murder one.
That's sunshine and roses to me.
It really is.
I'm tellin' you, we did the world a favour.
This guy was about as interesting|as watching paint dry.
Faith Joking.
Jeez, lighten up a little, B. He came out of nowhere.
I know.
Whatever.
I'm not lookin' to|hug and cry, learn and grow.
I'm just saying it happened quick, you know?
You know what?
Let's just blow.
Who cares what this guy was about?
|It's moot now, don't you think?
I don't think he was in that alley by chance.
|He was looking for us.
- I'd like to know why.
|- So you think there's some big conspiracy?
You were saying?
So his papers are gone.
|Doesn't prove anything.
Except that somebody|didn't want us to prove anything.
- Get as many men on it as you can.
|- Yeah.
We'll be wantin' to turn up the heat.
So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a black hat.
|That's a shocker, huh?
- Yeah.
I didn't get the bad guy vibe off him.
|- When are you gonna learn, B?
It doesn't matter|what vibe you get off a person.
Nine times outta ten the face|they're showing you is not the real one.
I guess you know a lot about that.
What is that supposed to mean?
Look at you, Faith.
|Less than 24 hours ago you killed a man.
And now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah?
That's not your real face and I know it.
I know what you're feeling.
|I'm feeling it, too.
Do you?
So fill me in, cos I'd like to hear this.
Dirty.
Like something sick creeped inside you|and you can't get it out.
And you hope it was just some nightmare,|but it wasn't.
- And we'll have to figure out|- Is there gonna be an intermission in this?
Just let me talk to Giles.
I swear We're not bringing anybody else into this.
Keep your head.
|This will blow over in a few days.
And if it doesn't?
If it doesn't,|a freighter leaves the docks twice a day.
- Ain't fancy, but it gets you gone.
|- And that's it?
You live with it?
You see the dead guy in your head|every day for the rest of your life?
Buffy, I'm not gonna see anything.
I missed the mark last night.
And I'm sorry|about the guy.
I really am.
But it happens.
Anyways, how many people do you think|we've saved by now?
Thousands?
You stopped the world ending.
In my book,|that puts you and me in the plus column.
We help people.
|It doesn't mean we can do what we want.
Why not?
The guy I offed was no Gandhi.
|I mean, he was mixed up in dirty dealings.
Maybe.
But what if|he was coming to us for help?
What if he was?
You're still not seeing the|big picture, B. Something made us different.
- We're warriors.
We were built to kill.
|- To kill demons.
It does not mean we can pass judgement,|like we're better than everybody.
We are better.
That's right.
Better.
People need us to survive.
In the balance, nobody's gonna|cry over a random bystander who got caught in the crossfire.
I am.
That's your loss.
Buffy.
Tell me again.
|You got home at what time last night?
Late.
A little past one, I guess.
Maybe you can explain to me|what a girl your age is doin' out all night.
Just hangin'.
Hanging?
By yourself?
No.
I was with my friend, Buffy.
- We were at Faith's, watching TV.
|- What did you watch?
Some old movie.
Infomercial.
That's funny.
Cos I've got a couple of|witnesses who put you near the alley.
Witnesses?
Somebody stabbed this guy through|the heart.
Strange thing is the weapon.
It was made outta wood.
Any of this mean anything to you?
Yeah.
That whoever did it|wasn't hip to the Bronze Age.
Is that it?
I'm kinda beat.
Yeah.
I have enough for now.
Buffy, if you know something,|if you're protecting someone, I promise you, it'd be better for everyone|if you come clean.
You mean, am I covering for someone?
Hardly.
I'm not the|"throw myself on the sword" type.
I wish I could help you.
Well, call me if you remember anything.
Hey.
Hey.
I need to talk to you.
Good.
Cos I've been letting things fester.
And I don't like it.
I wanna be fester-free.
Yeah.
Me too.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I completely understand why you and Faith|have been doing the bonding thing.
You guys work together.
|You should get along.
- It's more complicated than that.
|- But, see, it's that exact thing that's ticking me off.
It's this whole "slayers only" attitude.
Since when wouldn't I understand?
|You talk to me about everything.
It's like all of a sudden|I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill things|with my bare hands.
Buffy, don't cry.
I'm sorry.
I was too hard on you.
Sometimes I unleash.
|I don't know my own strength.
It's bad.
I'm bad.
I'm a bad, bad, bad person.
Will, I'm in trouble.
And Faith acts like she doesn't even care.
The way she talks,|it's like she didn't even make a mistake.
Do you think she's, like, in shock?
I don't know.
But I think that detective|knows more than he's saying.
- I think he knew that I was lying.
|- You have to go to Giles, Buffy.
He'll know what to do.
Giles?
Buffy.
I don't really know how to say this,|so I'm just gonna say it.
I know I've kept things from you before, but But But I've been blowing off my classes, you know, in the sense of not attending.
- And|- It's OK, Buffy.
I told him.
- You told him?
|- I had to.
He had to know what you did.
What I did?
Giles, no.
That's not what happened.
- I don't want to hear it.
|- No, I - I want no more lies.
|- You can't be serious.
You're setting me up?
In my office.
Faith, we'll talk in the morning.
- Giles, please, you have to|- Now.
I'm sorry.
Giles, I didn't do this.
I swear.
Look, I know that I messed up badly.
|But the murder was Faith.
I know.
She may have many talents, Buffy,|but fortunately lying is not one of them.
Oh, God.
- I thought|- I'm sorry.
I needed her to think that I was on her side.
|I don't know how far she'll take this charade.
Try far.
Like, all the way.
- You should have come to me right off.
|- I know.
Well, I wanted to.
- But Faith wouldn't hear of it?
|- It's not all her fault.
We both thought it was a vampire.
|I only realised a second before.
Buffy, this is not the first time|something like this has happened.
It's not?
The Slayer is on the front line|of a nightly war.
It's tragic, but accidents have happened.
- What do you do?
|- Well, the Council investigates.
Metes out punishment if punishment is due.
I have no plan to involve them.
I mean, it's the last thing|Faith needs at the moment.
She's unstable, Buffy.
|She's utterly unable to accept responsibility.
She's freaking.
So then we just have to help her deal, right?
She's in denial.
There is no help for her|until she admits what happened.
I could talk to her.
Perhaps.
Or maybe I'm too close.
- Maybe one of the guys could?
|- We should meet.
It may be that they're seeing|a different side of her.
OK.
In the meantime, no one else is to know.
Understood?
Of course.
Now this is extremely delicate.
If we scare her off now,|we may lose her forever.
Yes, hello.
Mr Travers, please.
|Quentin Travers.
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce calling.
The codeword?
Monkey.
M-O-N-K Just put him on, will you?
|This is an emergency.
Maybe we should talk to Faith together, You mean, like that intervention thing|you guys did on me?
As I recall, Xander and I|nearly came to blows.
You nearly came to blows.
|I nearly came to loss of limbs.
No, Faith is too defensive|for a confrontation like that.
She'd respond better|to a one-on-one approach.
I can be the one.
On her one.
Let's rephrase.
I think she might listen to me.
We kind of have a connection.
A connection?
Why would you think that I'm saying it's worth a shot.
That's all.
No, I don't see it, Xander.
I mean, of all of us, you're the one person|arguably Faith has had the least contact with.
Yeah, but we hung out a little.
- Recently.
And she seemed to be responsive.
|- When did you guys hang out?
She was fighting one of those|apocalypse demon things and I helped her.
- Gave her a ride home.
|- And you guys talked?
Not extensively.
No.
Then why would you?
I don't need to say "Oh".
I got it before.
They slept together.
Fine.
Let's move on.
Look, I know that you mean well, Xander,|but I just don't see Faith opening up to you.
She doesn't take the guys that she|has a connection with very seriously.
They're kind of a big joke to her.
No offence.
Oh, no.
I mean,|why would I be offended by that?
However, if you still want to be of assistance,|I need some help with research.
There's still the business of|the Mayor and Mr Trick to attend to.
Yeah.
They seemed pretty cosy|the other night.
Willow, can you access the Mayor's files?
What?
Sure.
I can try.
Good.
Yes.
Because, clearly,|we'll need to take a harder look at him.
He's obviously up to something.
What about Faith?
I don't know.
We need time.
She needs help now.
I owe her that.
What?
I just came by to see how you are, actually.
Sick of people asking me that, for one thing.
Can I come in?
Just to talk, I promise.
Think something could happen|if I didn't want it to?
Yeah.
You got me there.
Pretty much not gonna try to take ya|under any circumstances.
See?
Here.
Feel that.
|Probably like a wet noodle to ya, huh?
- Five minutes.
|- That's all I need.
For talking.
|In conversation, I'm quick as a bunny.
The clock is running.
It's just I heard about what happened|and I thought you might need a friend.
So go talk to Buffy.
|She's the one who killed the guy.
Yeah.
I heard that version.
Version?
Either way, it sounds like it was an accident|and that's the important part.
No.
The important part is that|Buffy is the "accidental" murderer.
Faith, you may not think so,|but I sort of know you.
And I've seen you post-battle.
And I know,|first hand, that you're like a wild thing.
And, half the time,|you don't know what you're doin'.
And you're living proof of that, aren't you?
See, you can try to hurt me, but right now|you need someone on your side.
What happened wasn't your fault.
I'm willing|to testify to that.
In court, if you need me.
You'd dig that, wouldn't you?
To get up in front of all your geek pals and|say how I made you my boy toy for a night.
- No.
No, that's not it.
|- I know what this is all about.
You came by here|cos you want another taste, don't you?
No.
I mean, it was nice.
It was great.
It was kind of a blur.
But, OK.
Someday, sure, yay.
But not now.
Not like this.
Well, like how then?
Lights on or off?
- Kinks or vanilla?
|- Faith, come on.
I came here to help you.
I thought we had a connection.
You wanna feel our connection?
It's just skin.
I see.
I want.
I take.
I forget.
No.
Wait.
- It was more than that.
|- I could do anything to you now.
And you want me to.
I could make you scream.
I could make you die.
Finally decided to tie me up, huh?
I always|knew you weren't really a one-slayer guy.
I'm sorry about the chains.
|It's not that I don't trust you.
It Actually, it is that I don't trust you.
That thing with Xander I know what|it looked like, but we were just playin'.
And he forgot the safety word.
- Is that it?
|- Safety words are for wusses.
I bet you're not big on trust games, Faith.
You gonna shrink me now, that it?
No.
I just wanna talk to you.
That's what they all say.
And then it's "Just let me stay the night.
|I won't try anything".
You wanna go the long way around?
|I can do that.
I'm not gettin' any older.
- How's she doing?
|- It's like talking to a wall.
- Only you get more from a wall.
|- But you'll keep trying?
Sure.
We're just gettin' started.
- So what do I do?
|- Look, right now there's nothing you can do.
This could take a while.
|So I'll go to Faith's and get some of her stuff.
- That way she'll see that we're on her side.
|- That's a good idea.
- OK.
I'll be back.
|- Look, I I don't want you to get your hopes up, Buffy.
|She may not want us to help her.
She does.
|She just doesn't know how to say it.
She killed a man.
|That changes everything for her.
Giles said, with counselling,|they might not lock her up.
That's not what I mean.
She's taken a life.
I know.
She's got a taste for it now.
Not one slayer, but two.
|Right here in the building.
- There was supposed to be a guard.
|- Here comes my favourite part.
Where the slayers see us|in the hall together, thick as thieves.
Wait, we are thieves.
And worse.
|And now they know it.
They're not gonna be much of a threat in jail.
We don't have near enough|evidence to put 'em away.
No.
You're gonna have to come up|with a more efficient solution.
And, Mr Trick, you'd better think of it soon.
I know what's goin' on with you.
Join the club.
|Everybody seems to have a theory.
But I know what it's like to take a life.
Feel a future, a world of possibilities,|snuffed out by your own hand.
I know the power in it.
The exhilaration.
- It was like a drug for me.
|- Yeah?
Sounds like you need some help.
|A professional, maybe.
A professional couldn't have helped me.
It stopped when I got my soul back.
|My human heart.
Goody for you.
If we're gonna party, let's get on with it.
|Otherwise, let me out of these things.
Faith, you have a choice.
You've tasted something few ever do.
I mean, to kill without remorse|is to feel like a god.
Right now, all I feel|is a cramp in my wrist.
Let me go.
But you're not a god.
|You're not much more than a child.
Going down this path will ruin you.
You can't imagine the price for true evil.
Yeah?
I hope evil takes MasterCard.
You and me, Faith, we're a lot alike.
Time was, I thought humans existed|just to hurt each other.
But then I came here.
And I found out that there are|other types of people.
People who genuinely wanted to do right.
And they make mistakes.
They fall down.
But they keep caring.
Keep trying.
If you can trust us, Faith, this can all change.
You don't have to disappear into the dark.
What?
By the order of|the Watchers' Council of Britain, I am exercising my authority|and removing you to England, where you will accept the judgement|of the disciplinary committee.
I'm sorry for the extreme measures.
Unfortunately, this is|a rather extreme circumstance.
Whatever.
Please believe,|nobody is rushing to judgement.
The first priority of both myself|and the Council is to help you.
Now, none of that.
Tighten her restraints.
|Faith, there's no point in fighting this.
Have to disagree with you.
Unlock these|or I'll pop this guy's head like a grape.
Don't even think about it.
Faith, you can't keep running.
Wrong again, Wes.
It was the new watcher.
|He had a couple of guys helpin' him.
Then he figured it out?
Which means Faith will be soon on her way|to England to face the Watchers' Council.
- And then what?
|- They'll lock her away for a good long while.
So we head them off at the airport|and stop them.
Can I I'm just wondering.
Why?
I'm not the most objective, I know.
I kinda have an issue with Faith|sharing my people.
But she murdered someone|and accused Buffy.
Then she hurt Xander.
I hate to say it,|but maybe she belongs behind bars.
She's out of control.
But Angel was getting|somewhere with her.
She was opening up.
- If we could just stop Wesley|- That's no longer an issue.
- You let her get away?
|- "Let" wouldn't be how I'd phrase it, but - Yes, she escaped.
|- That's good work.
Terrorise her,|then put her back on the streets.
That was hardly my plan.
|I was trying to save her.
- But you didn't.
You probably destroyed her.
|- Buffy, that's enough.
We'd better find her|before she does any more damage.
Let's split up.
I'll check the docks.
|She's probably there.
Giles, you go to her motel.
|Xander, Willow, her haunts.
And be careful.
I'll try the airport.
What can I do?
I want to help.
Still got your ticket back|to the mother county?
You don't give up, do you?
Not on my friends, no.
Yeah.
Because you and me|are such solid buds, right?
We could be.
It's not too late.
For me to change and be more like you,|Little Miss Goody Two Shoes?
- It ain't gonna happen, B.|- Faith, nobody's asking you to be like me.
- But you can't go on like this.
|- It scares you, doesn't it?
Yeah, it scares me.
You're hurting people.
|You're hurting yourself.
That's not it.
|That's not what bothers you so much.
What bugs you is you know I'm right.
|We don't need the law.
We are the law.
No.
Yes.
You know what I'm about.
|You have it in you, too.
- No.
You're sick.
|- I've seen it.
You've got the lust.
- I'm not just talkin' about screwin' vampires.
|- Don't bring him into this.
It was good, wasn't it?
The sex?
The danger?
Bet a part of you even dug him|when he went psycho.
- No.
|- You need me to toe the line because you're afraid you'll go over it.
|You can't handle the way I live.
It tempts you.
You know it could be you.
- There's my girl.
|- No.
I'm not gonna do this.
Why not?
It feels good.
Blood rising.
I hear, once you've tasted a slayer,|you never wanna go back.
Oh, no.
No, this is no good at all.
So she saved you?
She could have left me there|to die, Giles, but she didn't.
She opted to come back to town with you.
That bodes well.
She still has a lot to face|before she can put this behind her.
I'm not gonna give up on her.
Then I think she stands a chance.
You sent your boy to kill me.
That's right.
I did.
- He's dust.
|- I thought he might be.
What with you standing here and all.
I guess that means you have a job opening.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - You killed a man.
|- I don't care.
She's taken a life, She's got a taste for it now, I guess that means you have a job opening.
The necklace is a symbol of Anyanka,|She's a demon that grants wishes, - I wish Buffy had never come to Sunnydale.
|- Done.
I love this part.
Cordelia's wish changed this world, If we can destroy the necklace,|it will undo the wish, rendering Anyanka mortal and powerless, Do not ask again.
But Your powers were a gift of the lower beings.
|You have proved unworthy of them.
- I was robbed of them.
|- By your carelessness.
For a thousand years|I wielded the powers of the wish.
I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men.
I brought forth destruction and chaos|for the pleasure of the lower beings.
I was feared and worshipped across the globe|and now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High.
A mortal.
A child.
- And I'm flunking math.
|- This is no concern of ours.
You will live out your mortal life and die.
Give me another chance.
|Fold the fabric of time.
Send me back to that place and I'll change it.
- I won't fail again.
|- Your time is passed.
Do you have any idea|how boring 12th graders are?
I'm getting my power centre back.
And if you won't help me then, by the|pestilent gods, I will find someone who will.
The Watcher Council shrink is heavy|into tests.
He's got tests for everything.
TATs, Rorschach, associative logic.
|He even has that test to see if you're crazy that asks if you ever hear voices|or wanted to be a florist.
I used to want|Wait.
Florist means crazy, right?
I never wanted to do that.
- Neat.
|- Thanks.
It's all about emotional control.
|Plus, obviously, magic.
Hey, you wanna go to the espresso pump|and get sugared up on mochas?
I'll pass.
Hit the pool and do some laps.
How come the sudden callisthenics?
|Aren't you sort of naturally buff, Buff?
Buff Buff.
They've got us on the physical side, too.
Lot|of reflex evaluation and precision training.
- I just Well, I wanna do|- Better than Faith?
So very shallow.
Competition is natural and healthy.
Plus,|you'll definitely ace her on the psych test.
Just don't mark the box that says|"I sometimes like to kill people".
I know Faith's not gonna be on the cover|of Sanity Fair, but she had it rough.
- Different circumstances, that could be me.
|- No way.
Some people just don't have that in them.
Look, I'm sorry.
I know|how you hate talking about Faith.
- No, it's OK.
|- No, really, we should just It doesn't bother me.
I mean it.
ill - Emotional control?
|- I'm working on it.
As far as I'm concerned,|this is a marriage made in heaven.
Willow Rosenberg,|despite her unsavoury associations, represents the pinnacle|of academic achievement at Sunnydale High.
Percy West represents|a devastating fast break and 50 per cent from|behind the three-point line.
I'm not sure I understand the marriage part.
You've got the brains, he's got the fast break.
- It's a perfect match.
|- Match?
- You want us to breed?
|- I want you to tutor him.
Percy is flunking history.
|Nothing seems to be able to motivate him.
Hey, I'm challenged.
You're lazy, self-involved and spoiled.
|Quite the challenge.
But we need a winning year, especially|after last year's debacle with the swim team.
Can't have our point guard benched.
So,|you are going to take on a little teaching job.
- I know how you enjoy teaching.
|- Well, I have a lot of work of my own.
You've got a letter of acceptance|from every university with a stamp.
Yes, but I still have classes and I don't Rosenberg, it's time to give|something back to the community.
I know you wanna help your school out here.
|Ask me how I know.
- How do you|- I just know.
So he threatened you?
With what?
It wasn't exactly anything he said.
It was all in his eyes.
I mean, there was|some nostril work as well, but mostly eyes.
Snyder needs me to kick his ass.
No, Buffy, don't get in trouble.
I'll be OK.
I just hate the way he bullies people.
He just assumes everyone's time is his.
Willow, get on the computer.
|Take a pass at accessing the Mayor's files.
OK.
- Well, that was a blast.
|- How did it go?
Princess Margaret here|had a little trouble keeping up.
How did it go?
Faith did quite well on the obstacle field.
|Still a little sloppy, though.
You feel up to taking Buffy out, or shall I?
I'll be fine.
Just give me a minute.
And some|defibrillators, if it's not too much trouble.
You're gonna love it, B.|It's just like fun, only boring.
This evaluation|is a necessary part of the Council I know.
I'm on board here.
|Just shootin' my mouth off.
I better change.
Good luck.
Whatcha doing?
I'm trying to access|the Mayor's personal files.
- Can you do that?
|- He's got some tricky barriers set up.
Can you get past 'em?
Eventually I'll get through.
- That's very interesting.
|- Yeah, I thought so, too.
- Are you serious about this place?
|- Of course I am.
No slayer of mine's gonna|live in a fleabag hotel.
That place has a very unsavoury reputation.
|There are immoral liaisons going on there.
Yeah, plus all the screwing.
|This place is the kick.
We'll keep your old place, in case|you need to see your friends there, but Shoes!
Shoes!
- Thanks, sugar daddy.
|- Now, Faith I don't find that sort of thing amusing.
|I'm a family man.
Now, let's kill your little friend.
Don't worry.
I wouldn't ask you to do it,|not this early in the relationship.
Besides, I think a vampire attack|would look less suspicious anyway.
Let's take a look at the rest of the apartment.
If I'm not mistaken,|some lucky girl has herself a PlayStation.
- No way.
|- Yes way.
- Hey.
|- Oz, hi.
There's something about you|that's causing me to hug you.
It's like I have no will of my own.
Where were you yesterday?
We got back late, sort of very.
- We?
Who?
Where?
|- The band.
We had a gig in Monterey Sunday night.
You did?
How come I didn't know?
I thought you did.
- Maybe I would have liked to go.
|- Didn't figure you for missing school.
You think I'm boring.
I'd call that a radical|interpretation of the text.
- We're playing tonight, at the Bronze.
|- I can't.
I have too much homework.
If you get done early?
Percy.
Hey.
Listen, I thought we could get together today|at lunch and go over your Roosevelt paper.
- You know, what books you'll need.
|- What are you talking about?
- Me tutoring you.
Your history paper?
|- Yeah, Snyder said you were gonna do it.
- He never said that.
|- What meeting were you at?
I'll get the books.
Meet me at lunch and No, no.
I don't have any time at lunch.
|I gotta hang out.
- Well|- What, you got something better to do?
Just type it up and put my name on it.
And|don't type too good.
It's a dead giveaway.
I'm eating this now.
|It's not lunchtime.
I don't even care.
Willow, did you remember|to tape Biography last Friday?
- See?
I told you.
Old Reliable.
|- Thanks.
- What?
|- Old Reliable?
Yeah, great.
There's a sexy nickname.
- I didn't mean it as|- No, it's fine.
I'm Old Reliable.
She means the geyser.
You're like a geyser|of fun that goes off at regular intervals.
- That's Old Faithful.
|- Isn't that the dog that the guy had to shoot?
- That's Old Yeller.
|- Xander, I beg you not to help me.
I didn't mean it as a bad thing.
|I think it's good to be reliable.
Well, maybe I don't wanna be|reliable all the time.
Maybe I'm not just some doormat person.
|Homework Gal.
I'm thinking nerve strike.
Maybe I'll change my look.
|Or cut class.
You don't know.
And I'm eating this banana.
|Lunchtime be damned.
- Will, wait.
I'm really sorry.
|- Buff, I'm storming off.
It doesn't really work if you come with me.
Willow?
Hi.
Anya.
I'm sort of new here.
- I know Cordelia.
|- Fun.
Yeah.
Listen, I have this project I'm working|on and I heard you were the person to ask if Yeah, that's me.
Reliable dog geyser person.
- What do you need?
|- It's nothing big.
- Just a little spell I'm working on.
|- A spell?
I like the black arts.
I just need a secondary|to create a temporal fold.
- I heard you were a pretty powerful wicca.
|- You heard right, mister.
I'm always ready to work some dark mojo.
So, tell me, is it dangerous?
No.
Well, could we pretend it is?
The necklace was a family heirloom,|passed down for generations.
Then it was stolen|from my mom's apartment.
How does the spell work?
Well, we both call on Eyrishon,|the Endless One.
Offer up the standard supplication.
|Then there's a teensy temporal fold.
We hope.
I pour the sacred sand on|the representation of the necklace, and Eyrishon brings it forth|from the time and place it was lost.
Cool.
- Are we ready?
|- I think so.
- The child to the mother.
|- The river to the sea.
Eyrishon, hear my prayer.
That was What was that?
It's not here.
It's not here.
OK.
That's a little blacker than I like my arts.
- Don't be such a wimp.
|- That wasn't just some temporal fold.
That was some weird hell place.
|I don't think you're telling me everything.
I swear, I am just trying to find my necklace.
Well, did you try looking|inside the sofa in Hell?
Look, we'll just try it again and No.
I think emphatically not.
- I can't do it by myself.
|- That's a relief.
I'm outta here.
Fine.
Go.
Idiot child.
I believe these chicken feet are mine.
Look, magic is dangerous, Anya.
|It's not to be toyed with.
Now, if you'll excuse me,|I have someone else's homework to do.
Nothing!
This is weird.
- I'll race ya.
|- Maybe we can get something to eat.
Excuse me Hey.
Rosenberg?
What are you doing,|trick-or-treating?
You're supposed to be|doing my history report.
I flunk that class,|you're in big trouble with Snyder.
Till we graduate, I own your ass.
Bored now.
I'm having a terrible night.
Wanna make it better?
What's goin' on?
Is there a funny thing?
Back off.
You stay the hell away from her.
OK.
Sure.
Xander Changin' the look, not an idle threat with you.
You're alive.
Will, this is verging on|naughty touching here.
Don't wanna fall back on bad habits.
|Hands.
Hands in new places.
You're alive.
You mentioned that before.
- Will, are you OK?
|- No.
Everything's different.
- There you are.
|- Hey, Buff.
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your|Holy God, you're Willow.
You You know what?
I like the look.
It's extreme.
But it looks good.
|You know, it's a leather thing and I said extreme already, right?
I don't like you.
I'm sorry about today.
You know how|my foot likes to live in my mouth.
But you really didn't have to prove anything.
Leaving now.
- Gotta say, not loving the new you.
|- Will, wait Get off me!
Willow Rosenberg?
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Then we won't talk.
- You made me cranky.
|- There's been a mistake here.
We were sent after a human.
Really?
Who do you work for?
I'm not telling you a thing.
Who do you work for?
Wilkins, the Mayor.
Who do you work for?
You.
Get your friends.
Bring them here.
The world's no fun any more.
We're gonna make it the way it was.
Starting with the Bronze.
Buffy.
I thought you were|going out tonight.
I didn't expect What is it?
This isn't real.
I can't feel anything.
Arms, legs, anything.
She was truly the finest of all of us.
Way better than me.
Much, much better.
- It's all my fault.
|- No.
It's me.
Maybe it's me.
I called her "reliable".
|She must've gone out and gotten attacked, which she never would have done|if I hadn't called her reliable.
- And now my best friend is|- What's going on?
Jeez, who died?
- God!
Who died?
|- Back!
Get back, demon!
- Willow, you're alive?
|- Aren't I usually?
I love you guys, too.
OK, oxygen becoming an issue.
Giles, what's going on with these?
Sorry.
It's really nice that you guys missed me.
Say, you all didn't happen to do|a bunch of drugs, did you?
Will, we saw you at the Bronze.
A vampire.
- I'm not a vampire.
|- You are.
I mean, you were.
Giles, planning on jumping in|with an explanation anytime soon?
Something|Something very strange is happening.
Can you believe the Watchers' Council|let this guy go?
What a day.
- Gimme a beer.
|- ID.
ID.
I'm 120 years old!
|Just give me a frickin' beer!
- ID.
|- Give me a Coke.
Man, we need a roadie.
|Other bands have roadies.
Other bands know more than three chords.
Professional bands can play up to six|or seven completely different chords.
That's just, like, fruity jazz bands.
- Oz|- Hey, man.
- You looking for Buffy?
|- As always.
Well, no sightings as of yet.
|But I think she said she'd show.
- That doesn't look good.
|- Everybody, shut up!
All right.
Nobody cause any trouble,|or try to leave and nobody gets hurt.
- Why don't I believe him?
|- Well, he lacks credibility.
- Can you get outta here?
|- Skylight in the roof.
- I can make it.
|- I think we need some backup.
- I think I'm needed here.
|- Ten to one.
Could get pointless.
Look Everyone's all afraid.
It's just like old times.
Get Buffy.
Do it now.
Dude, check out your girlfriend.
- What's your name?
|- Sandy.
You don't have to be afraid, just to please me.
If you're all good boys and girls,|we'll make you young and strong for ever and ever.
We'll have fun.
If you're not Questions?
Comments?
Willow - You don't wanna do this.
|- I don't?
But I'm so good at it.
- Who did this to you?
|- I know you.
You're a white hat.
How come|you're talking to me like we're friends?
Because he thinks you're someone else.
He thinks you're the Willow|that belongs in this reality.
- Another me?
|- You know this isn't your world, right?
- You know you don't belong here?
|- No.
This is a dumb world.
In my world, there are people in chains|and we can ride them like ponies.
- You wanna get back there?
|- Yeah.
So do I. This is creepy.
I don't like the thought that|there's a vampire out there that looks like me.
- Not looks like.
Is.
|- It was exactly you, Will.
Every detail.
Except for your not being a dominatrix.
|As far as we know.
Oh, right.
Me and Oz play|Mistress of Pain every night.
Did anyone else just go|to a scary visual place?
Yeah.
Buffy, I Something's happened that Willow's dead.
Hey, Willow.
Wait a second.
- We're right there with you, buddy.
|- We saw her too at the Bronze.
OK She's there now with|a cadre of vampires looking to party.
We figure out who she is after we stop|the feeding frenzy.
How many were there?
- Eight or ten.
|- Call Faith?
I don't want her in combat yet.
|Not around civilians.
Guys?
What are we gonna do with me?
|The other me.
I don't know, Will.
We just have to stop them.
I get that.
I just kind of wanted to know.
Hey, go.
I'll catch up.
Alone at last.
Well, look at me.
I'm all fuzzy.
What do I want with you?
Your little schoolfriend, Anya, said|that you're the one that brought me here.
She said that you could|get me back to my world.
But I don't know.
I kinda like the idea of the two of us.
We could be quite a team,|if you came around to my way of thinking.
Would that mean we have to snuggle?
What do you say?
Wanna be bad?
This just can't get more disturbing.
No more!
|You're really starting to freak me out.
You don't wanna play,|I guess I can't force you.
Wait.
I can.
Bitch.
It's extraordinary.
It's horrible.
That's me as a vampire?
I'm so evil and skanky.
And I think I'm kinda gay.
Just remember, a vampire's personality|has nothing to do with the person that was.
Well, actually That's a good point.
- What do we do now?
|- We have to go to the Bronze.
Even if they're supposed to wait, they may|start feeding.
Vampires aren't reliable.
So we charge in,|much in the style of John Wayne?
High casualty risk.
|I haven't any other plan, though.
I have a really bad idea.
They're still in a holding pattern.
That's good.
|They must really be afraid of you.
Who wouldn't be?
- Are you OK in that?
|- It's a little binding.
I guess vampires really don't have to breathe.
Gosh.
Look at those.
Willow, you go in and defuse|the situation as best you can.
At least try and get some of them|to come out and even up the odds.
First sign of trouble, you give us a signal.
|We come in hard and fast.
- What is the signal?
|- Me screaming.
Giles, you and Xander|wait by the back entrance.
- Are you up to this?
|- Don't worry.
I won't do anything|that could be interpreted as brave.
We'll be right outside.
Hi, I'm back.
Did you find the girl?
Yep, I did.
Where is she?
I killed her.
And sucked her blood, as we vampires do.
I think maybe I heard something out there.
|Why don't you go check?
How could you kill her?
She was|our best shot at getting your world back.
I don't like that you dare question me.
Maybe I'll have my minions take you|out back and kill you horribly.
Vampires.
Always thinking with your teeth.
She bothered me.
|She's so weak and accommodating.
She's always letting people walk all over her, and then she gets cranky|with her friends for no reason.
I just couldn't let her live.
You know, he's been gone for a while.
|Why don't you go check on him?
Well, boss, since that plan is out, why don't we get with the killing?
Oh, no, this is like a nightmare.
Hello?
Giles?
Wesley?
I just happened to stop by for books.
- Hey, you.
|- Hey me?
Hey me what?
- I have a name, you know.
|- Cordelia What did you do?
|Lock yourself in the book cage?
Yeah.
Let me out.
Cos I'm so helpless.
OK.
I think Giles keeps a spare How'd you manage|to lock yourself in, anyway?
I was looking at books.
I like books - cos I'm shy.
|- Yeah, right.
The famous shy-girl act all the boys fall for.
Open the cage.
Wait It occurs to me that we've never|really had the opportunity to talk.
You know, woman to woman,|with you locked up.
Don't wanna talk.
Hungry.
What could we talk about?
|How about the ethics of boyfriend stealing?
I don't know if I feel like killing any more.
I'm so bored.
It would be like shooting fish in a barrel.
Where's the fun?
With all due respect, boss,|the fun would be the eating.
Maybe we should let everyone go|and give them a 30-second head start.
- Wait a minute|- No.
I like my plan.
- Nice try.
|- OK, let's get to the killing.
- Let's start with her.
|- Let's start with you.
If she's a vampire, then|I'm the creature from the Black Lagoon.
And, OK, it isn't even like|I was that attracted to Xander.
It was more just that we kept being|put in these life-or-death situations and that's always all sexy and stuff.
I mean, I more or less knew he was a loser.
But that doesn't make it OK|for you to come around and What?
- Do I have something on my neck?
|- Not yet.
- Am I getting a zit?
|- Cordelia I'm very sorry.
I realise I was wrong.
|I'll never steal your boyfriend again.
Like you could.
I should just leave you|in there, but I'm a great humanitarian.
And you will just have to think|of a way to pay me back sometime.
OK.
How about dinner?
I didn't mean all that stuff I said.
|I want you to have Xander.
- My blessings on you both.
|- I'm so over him.
I need fresh blood.
No more hiding.
Back!
Creature of the night!
|Leave this place!
Don't wanna.
Whatever.
- I'm sorry.
|- No, no.
A little on edge.
You know.
Men in combat.
- Are you all right?
|- You saved my life.
Thank you.
Yes.
- Was that?
|- Willow.
They got Willow.
So, are you doing anything tonight?
I'm just so tired of being around|human beings and all their baggage.
I don't care if I ever get my powers back.
I think he should eat you.
This girl has a history of mental problems|dating back to early childhood.
I'm a bloodsucking fiend.
Look at my outfit.
A human.
I should have smelled it right away.
A human?
Oh, yeah?
Could a human do this?
- Sure.
Humans do that, yeah.
|- Yeah.
I think, yeah.
Ow!
Happy, but ow!
Devon, come on!
.
No more snuggles?
Buffy, no!
- Nice reflexes.
|- Well, I work out.
This world's no fun.
You noticed that, too?
So, in your reality,|I'm like this badass vampire, huh?
People afraid of me?
Yeah.
I'm bad.
I'm not sure about releasing this thing|into the wild, Will.
It is a demon.
I just can't kill her.
No, me neither.
I mean, I know she's not me.
|We have a big nothing in common, but still There but for the grace of gettin' bit.
We send her back to her world|and she stands a chance.
It's the way it should be, anyway.
We're about ready here.
Don't you try any tricks now, dear.
I don't need tricks.
When I get my powers|back you will all grovel before me.
Yes, if you Willows would like to complete the circle?
Good luck.
Try not to kill people.
Hands.
Hands.
You wanna go out tonight?
Strangely, I feel like staying at home.
And doing my homework.
And flossing.
And dying a virgin.
You know, you can OD on virtue.
Between me and my evil self,|I have double-guilt coupons.
I see now where the path of vice leads.
|She messed up everything she touched.
I don't ever wanna be like that.
- Hey.
Hi.
|- Hi.
Listen, I didn't have a chance OK.
So, I did the outline|for the paper on Roosevelt.
There were two President Roosevelts.
I didn't|know exactly which one to do, so I did both.
And I know they're kinda short,|but I can flesh them out.
And here's the bibliography.
|And I can retype that if you want.
You just let me know what|I did wrong and I'll get on that.
- You wanna go out tonight?
|- Nine sound good?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - I'm Faith.
|- I'd say there's a new slayer in town.
If violence upsets you,|you're in the wrong line of work.
Or maybe you like it a little too much.
Faith, no!
- You killed a man.
|- I don't care.
- She's unstable, Buffy.
|- I guess that means you have a job opening.
Well - Well|- That was very artistic.
Yeah.
It wasn't what I expected.
|I've never actually seen Well, from the title,|I thought it was about food.
Well, there was food.
Right.
The scene with the food.
So feel like getting some hot chocolate?
Or some cold shower?
I'm sorry.
I wanted to|take you out somewhere fun.
It's been a long time since I've been|to the movies.
They've changed.
A little scary.
And a little not, which is also scary.
I'm sorry.
I just don't like|getting you worked up like that.
We can't actually do any of those things.
You'd lose your soul, and besides,|I don't even own a kimono.
Buffy, you don't have to worry about me.
I just don't like to rub your nose in it.
I suddenly wonder where|that expression comes from.
I don't need to see movies to get worked up.
|Just being around you does that just fine.
It doesn't mean I'm gonna lose control,|that I'm gonna be frustrated around you.
It feels nice just to feel.
It doesn't drive you crazy when we're close?
Watch this.
You see?
Safe as houses.
Check out the lust bunnies.
Patrol?
- The Council has you back on active duty?
|- Finally.
They want us down by Mercer.
OK.
Good night.
- I'll see you soon.
|- Don't worry, big guy.
Just keepin' her warm for you.
Gotta tell you, B. The willpower thing?
- Nice job.
|- Thanks.
- What?
|- The "close, but no cigar" deal with Angel.
I don't know if I could handle, you know,|the way you're not handling it.
Faith, when it comes|to Angel, do me a favour.
Duck!
What are you, nuts?
|Goin' around punchin' people?
- People?
|- So what?
I'm a demon.
That makes it OK?
Hold it!
Stake me now,|and you never find out what I got for you.
Think about it.
|"Demon seeks slayers".
Highly unusual?
Talk fast.
How'd you like to get your hands|on the Books of Ascension?
- Never heard of them.
|- Books of Ascension, Very powerful works.
And I'm not talkin' about the prose.
|They deal with some dark stuff.
And the Mayor would hate it if somebody|got a hold of them before he - Well, you know.
|- Don't know.
Before he what?
Hey, read 'em and weep.
|That's all I got to say.
Tomorrow I get the books.
Meet me here.
|If the price is right, I give the books to you.
- Not really looking to trade with a demon.
|- In a barter economy, that'd be a problem.
I want cash, princess.
|Five large for the whole set.
So you can buy - I'm guessing here -|some skincare products?
Plane ticket out of the Hellmouth|before it's "Adios, Slayer Loco".
So, five Gs.
What do you say?
I think "Die, fiend" sums it up.
Let him go.
I don't think he falls into|the "deadly threat to humanity" category.
A demon's a demon.
I'd like to know more about|these Books of Ascension, Anything that would|pin the Mayor down would be great.
Yeah.
It'd be great.
And what exactly did this demon look like?
Demonic.
And you say he has|the Books of Ascension, or will soon, and he was, what, willing to sell them?
That's what I said.
You know what I wish?
|I wish you'd pull your hair back.
I know.
Fashion isn't exactly my "thing".
But gosh darn it, you know,|you've got such a nice face.
I can't understand why you hide it.
Yeah.
Sure.
Whatever.
It's just a matter of time|before this demon guy's gonna spill.
- Buffy and the Superfriends are gonna|- You worry too much.
That's unnecessary stress.
|Luckily, I've got just the thing.
There you go.
Now, first|you load up on calcium, then find this demon, kill the heck|out of him, and bring the books to me.
- And if Buffy gets to him first?
|- Well, frankly, I don't like to think about that.
I like good, positive, "up" thoughts.
If you failed me in that way Well, you know, replacing|Mr Trick was chore enough.
Come on, don't worry.
Drink up.
There's nothing uncool|about healthy teeth and bones.
And you say this demon wanted cash?
- That's very unusual.
|- Demons after money.
What happened to the still beating heart|of a virgin?
No one has standards any more.
- He said the books were worth the price.
|- What's this Ascension mean?
- I'm not sure.
|- Not really a common term in demonology.
The Merenshtadt Text, I think in the section on genocide|they mention Ascension.
- We have a winner.
|- And, more importantly, two losers.
- Where did you find that?
|- In the top of your cabinet, with the stuff you try to keep hidden.
Hidden?
Are there any engravings|I should know about?
Frolicking nymphs of some kind?
No, just magic secrets|Giles doesn't think I'm ready for.
Yes.
Here we are.
There's a reference here|to the journal of Desmond Kane, pastor of a town called Sharpsville.
"May 26, 1723".
"Tomorrow is the Ascension.
|God help us all".
- That was the last anyone heard.
|- Of Kane?
Of Sharpsville.
The town|more or less disappeared.
So, Ascension possibly not a love-in.
- I think you should meet with this demon.
|- Yeah?
Anybody got $5,000?
I have something important to ask you.
Important?
Let's start|calculating those odds, people.
What are you doing Friday night?
As always, my sacred duty|as a watcher prevents me from - Why?
|- I have a paper to write, for English.
And you're English, so I thought What?
Is it so wrong to be|getting an insider's perspective?
I study best in a good restaurant,|around eightish?
Think it over?
On the day the words "flimsy excuse" were|redefined, we stood in awe and watched.
Right.
Books of Ascension, Mayor.
Slaughter.
Tell you what.
Why don't we try to find|this demon sooner rather than later, perhaps persuade him to lend us|the books free of charge?
I think Faith might be useful|in that "persuasion" part.
I imagine so.
Where is Faith, anyway?
Hey!
Slayer.
You know,|I wasn't expecting company.
Give me a minute,|and I'll have the place tidied up.
- You got the books?
|- Well, that depends.
You got my money?
You're tough in negotiations,|and I respect that.
Check 'em out.
|Now, that is quality merchandise.
- Worth five grand, easy.
|- Books of Ascension, Original editions and everything.
|Great condition.
OK, it's a little worn on one spine,|some slight foxing, but otherwise perfect.
Now, the five grand.
|It's, you know, negotiable.
I don't like to haggle.
Faith.
Angel I got nowhere else to go.
Look, I hate asking for help, but I'm asking cos I'm in trouble, like, the real bad kind.
It's OK.
No, it's a couple of county lines|over from OK, believe me.
I believe you.
Look, just talk.
Come on.
Start from the beginning.
Mind if I skip past the "Mom never loved me"|part and get right to it?
- I'm scared of myself.
|- I know the feeling.
That's why I came to you.
|I don't want to get all 12-steppy, but remember when you told me killing people|would make me feel like some kind of god?
I think I just came down to earth.
|It's not human, if that's what you're thinking.
Not that that makes me feel any better,|or this guy any less dead.
Faith, you need help.
You can't do this alone.
I know.
For real now, I'm scared.
Scared of what I am, what I'm turning into.
A cold-blooded straight-up killer.
Like you.
Not like me.
I didn't have a choice.
But you do.
Look, you can stop this.
Believe me, I don't want to end up|the way everyone said I would.
- Dead, or alone or a loser.
|- You don't have to.
I don't know.
Maybe it's too late for me.
It's not.
Angel, I'm so scared.
It's all right.
It's OK.
Faith.
I Look, I can be here for you,|but not like that, all right?
- I'm with Buffy.
|- Buffy.
Yeah.
I didn't mean it like that.
Maybe I did but I wouldn't press it.
You love her, don't you?
- I love her.
|- Good for you.
The two of you.
You're lucky.
Are we friends?
- We're friends.
|- Then I'm lucky too.
I better go.
Where?
I need to cool down, spend some time alone.
Don't worry about me.
|You've been a big help.
Just knowing somebody cares.
Hey, I know I shouldn't be asking this, but|do you think if things were different that things between|you and me'd be different too?
- We'll never know.
|- Right.
- How could we?
|- Take care of yourself.
Lifetime of practice.
- It's not like I wasn't trying, OK?
|- Hey, I'm sure you gave it your level best.
I don't understand what he could be thinking.
Try "Buffy Summers".
|Like in a big, fat, one-track way.
Hey, come on.
Don't be discouraged.
You're a bright, energetic girl with a whole|life ahead of her.
I won't tolerate brooding.
So you couldn't give him|a moment of happiness.
I was thinking more of a long weekend.
And he spurned your advances.
So be it.
|There's more than one way to skin a cat.
And I happen to know that's factually true.
We wanna take Angel's soul away.
|If we can't do it by giving him happiness, well, by golly, we'll just have to do it|in the most painful way imaginable.
Find anything?
A six-course banquet of nothing with|a scoop of sod all as a palate cleanser.
I've had no better luck.
There must be something|about this Ascension somewhere.
- Perhaps I should contact the Council|- No.
I don't It should be I that The Council isn't entirely aware|that I'm letting you work for me.
With me.
I don't think they'd be very happy at the idea.
I wasn't about to burst into glorious song|about it myself.
Why don't you call them?
I think the most expedient plan would be|to find these Books of Ascension, Buffy, you and Faith must find this demon.
- And soon.
|- Well, I'll go back to the scene, see if I can track him.
Wait for Faith.
That could be hours.
|The girl makes Godot look punctual.
I'll just go myself.
Buffy, this is a job for the both of you.
|This demon could be anywhere.
If these books are as important as he says,|he has good reason to hide.
- Finding him will be extremely difficult.
|- Found your demon.
Fashion tip, Wes?
Mouth looks better closed.
I got the address.
I beat it|out of Willy the Snitch personally.
- You beat up Willy.
|- Sure.
Well, actually, let's say|I applied some pressure.
Or more accurately,|that I asked politely, and then - OK, I bribed him.
|- How much?
- Did you get a receipt?
|- Damn.
I know this.
It's down by the bus station.
- Not the nicest part of town.
|- Again, see?
No standards.
I mean, any self-respecting demon should be|living in a pit of filth or a nice crypt.
I'll remember to mention that.
Mention what?
|Where are we going, girlfriend?
- Actually I can handle this one solo.
|- Why should you get to have all the fun?
Share, share, that's fair, right?
Right.
We found our demon.
Well, let's go look him up.
Is it me, or did it just get really cold in here?
- Faith, careful.
|- Right.
- Missed you last night.
|- Yeah.
I was patrolling.
No shortage of scum|you gotta watch in Sunnydale, right?
So I've heard.
- Looks like somebody got here first.
|- I'm bettin' they got the books, too.
Some hit.
This wasn't just a hit.
|This is somebody's idea of a party.
Maybe the guy put up a fight.
We gotta get goin'.
Come on.
|Nothin' we can do here now.
You coming?
Mint?
Didn't think so.
Well, scheduling a man of your talents|is quite the chore, I'll tell you.
Between the chanting and the sacrifice|My golf game is shot.
But here you are.
You know why I've summoned you.
Can you do it?
Need anything from me?
|You're not much of a people person, are you?
You have risked great danger|in calling on me.
The deadliest Magicks are needed|to rob this creature of its soul.
- Big job, all right.
|- And so it shall be done.
That's just swell.
Listen, are you sure|you don't want any?
They're low calorie.
OK.
Are you OK?
You seem a little on edge.
Is there anything that's wrong?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
All right, all right.
Stop with the third degree.
- It's Faith.
|- What about her?
I went to Angel's last night|and Faith was there.
They looked sort of intimate.
No way.
I know what|you're thinking, and no way.
You're right.
Faith would never do that.
Faith would totally do that.
Faith was built to do that.
|She's the "Do That Girl".
- Comfort.
Remember, comfort?
|- I mean, please.
Does Angel come up to|Faith's standards for a guy?
- Let's see, is he breathing?
|- Actually, no.
But Buffy, Angel.
There's no way he would ever do that.
I mean, you're the only thing|in the world to him.
Sometimes I wonder.
Angel and Faith have a lot in common.
And there's so much he doesn't tell me.
But it's so clear.
The way he feels about you?
Buffy, I too know the love of a taciturn man,|and you have to look at their actions.
- I was.
|- Well, what did he say?
Say?
You mean when I straightforwardly|asked him what was going on?
- So you bailed?
|- I couldn't.
I mean not there.
Enough.
Stop with the crazy.
Go talk to Angel.
- But I just|- No.
Go.
I give you leave to go.
Thank you.
- Faith.
|- Hey.
- Sorry to bust in uninvited.
|- What do you want?
Look, I'm not so good at apologies.
Mostly cos I think the world's out to|screw me, so I'm more owed than owing.
But I've been thinking about last night,|and I want you to know I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
|- No, it's not all right.
Yeah, I was freaked.
I needed somebody.
But you're with Buffy.
I should know better.
OK.
- You don't trust me.
|- It's not that.
Hey, no problem.
Join the club.
Look, Faith Look, I know what you're goin'|through, all right?
And how hard it can be.
It's important that you have|somebody who's been there, OK?
Who understands what you're goin' through.
I wanna trust you.
Chump.
Faith!
I wanted to do this|the old-fashioned way, but your loss.
- I got tricks Buffy don't know.
|- You don't have to do this.
I know.
But it's fun.
|Now relax.
It'll all be over soon.
Thanks so much.
It's good to have the taste|of a slayer back in my mouth.
It's like cigarettes, you know?
|Just when I thought I'd quit.
No, really.
Don't get up.
It's good to be back in Sunnydale.
Nice climate, plenty to eat,|no tortured humanity to hold me down.
But you know what bothers me?
You don't seem to be gettin'|the big picture here.
Now, I don't know why you turned me.
|But let me tell you, I'm just glad you did.
- I got my reasons.
|- Let me guess.
You summoned back the true Angelus|because you need a new boy toy?
I'm sorry.
Doesn't work that way.
- You wanna be smart?
You listen to me.
|- Funny thing about vampires, Faith.
We don't establish|meaningful dialogue with slayers.
Not how Buffy tells it.
- I should have known you'd like it on top.
|- You wanna listen or do you wanna die?
As long as you're there, I mostly|want you to wriggle.
But I'm listening.
Last time you got like this,|Buffy kicked your ass back to Hell.
- Do you wanna do better this time?
|- Still listening.
Good boy.
Now, you play nice and call truce, and I'll|hook you up with the real power in this town.
- Interested?
|- Very.
Then get ready to meet the new boss.
Our enemy has us at a disadvantage.
We|seem consistently to be one step behind him.
Now he has the Books of Ascension,|we must take definitive action.
You have the greatest voice.
Have you|ever thought about doing books on tape?
- Way to focus, CC.
|- Yes, let's Let's try to stay on track.
|We need everyone working together here.
- Where's Angel?
|- I don't know.
I went to the mansion, but he wasn't there.
- And Faith?
|- She's missing, too.
Which means nothing.
|Two unconnected events.
- What shall we do?
|- Try to retrieve the Books of Ascension, Check out the Mayor's office, but be|damned careful.
Do not confront the Mayor.
I'll go home and stock up on weapons, slip into something|a little more break-and-enterish.
Right.
Willow, how far|did you get with the Mayor's files?
Excuse me.
I believe|Wesley is running this meeting.
It's quite all right.
- Willow?
|- It's all bad news.
By the time I got through the encryptions,|the files were empty.
- I guess he saw me coming.
|- What about the Hall of Records?
- Go to the source.
|- Good idea.
- There must be information there.
|- Why not take the group and start looking?
- Right.
|- I'm in Wesley's group.
- There is just the one group.
|- Yes.
And I'm in it.
Anyone mind if I skip the trip?
I'm gonna|cruise town, keep my ear to the ground.
- And I think five's a crowd.
|- It really is.
- I'll drive.
|- They liked your plan.
If anyone finds anything, check in with me.
Be careful.
So, can I keep him?
Let's just take things step by step.
|Now then, Angelus.
May I call you Angel?
Well, actually, I'm thinking more|along the lines of you calling me "Master".
You know, Angelus, attitude may get you|attention, but courtesy wins respect.
I am the one responsible|for your new attitude.
That's why I'm here.
No trouble with the transition?
|No side effects?
Had a soul, now I'm free.
That's terrific.
Poetic, too.
|Not that I read much poetry.
Except the little ones in Reader's Digest,|Some are quite catchy.
Hey, I don't mean to rush things here, but|are you trying to get to some kind of point?
Kids today.
Rush, rush, rush.
Well, the point, Angel, is you're|a very powerful young man, good for Faith.
And there just may be|a future for you here in Sunnydale.
I see you're admiring my letter opener.
Well, actually, I was thinking|of stabbing you through the heart with it.
Please do.
Nice shot.
You see, I'm what you might call|"impervious".
Can't be killed, or harmed in any way.
And that's just a cornerstone in my plans|for this great town of ours.
- Can't be killed.
But you don't like germs.
|- Awful things.
Unsanitary.
But my question is, now that Faith has|brought you back, what are your intentions?
Well, gee, sir, I thought I'd find that slayer|that's giving you so much trouble, and torture, maim and kill her.
Fine.
It's nice to see you're not one of those|"slacker" types running around town today.
Yeah.
Torture Buffy.
Killing her's fine.
|Just make it a slow one.
- My favourite kind.
|- Wonderful.
We don't want a replacement|slayer anytime soon.
They can't all turn out like my girl Faith.
- Have fun.
|- Let's do it.
Try to have her home by 11.
She's not a little girl any more.
"I love when you talk, Wesley.
|I love when you sing, Wesley".
Can you say the words "jail bait", Wesley?
|Limey bastard!
Hey, guys.
Where you been?
You gotta find Buffy.
She's going|to her place to stock up That guy just bugs me.
- Faith.
Angel.
|- Hi, Joyce.
Nice to see you.
Is Buffy home?
Upstairs.
Please tell me|it's not some vampire thing.
The only vampire here is me, Joyce.
Say did you change your hair?
Highlights.
Looks nice.
Knock, knock.
- Where have you been?
|- Looking for you.
Good thing we found you before you left.
- We got the books.
|- They're at the mansion.
We'd take 'em to Giles ourselves, but|I think strength in numbers is the way to go.
Let me get those for you.
OK, let's get the books|someplace safe.
Where are they?
Actually, there's been|a slight change in plan, Buff.
"Buff"?
You just called - What's the matter with you?
|- Nothing.
Matter of fact, I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Angel?
You know, I never properly thanked you|for sending me to Hell.
- No.
|- And I'm just wondering, where do I start?
A card?
Fruit basket?
Evisceration?
- No.
|- I know what you're thinking.
Maybe there's some good deep inside of me|that loves you, if only you could reach me.
But then again, we have reality.
I will kill you before I let you touch me.
Faith, we need to get out of here.
Now.
Speak for yourself, B. Me?
I like it here.
One thing I learned about Buffy.
|She's so cute when she's sleeping.
Hey, I know a way to make|investigating the Mayor even more boring.
- On second thought, no, I don't.
|- Hey, whoa.
Whoa.
Big "hey, whoa".
Guys, check this out.
Like father, like son.
How about "like exact same guy,|like exact same guy"?
Mayor Wilkins is over 100 years old.
- He's not human.
|- I hate to spoil the mood.
- But this is so much worse than you think.
|- Xander.
What happened to you?
You know how some people|hate to say "I told you so"?
Not me.
I told you so.
Angel's back.
In the really bad sense.
And I told you so.
Angelus has turned?
Xander,|this is terribly serious.
Are you sure?
Gee, let me think.
Kinda hard to tell.
|Last thing I remember is his fist.
- We must contact Giles immediately.
|- Good thinking.
Let's waste time with a lively debate,|leave Buffy alone and see how dead she gets.
- Slow down.
This isn't Wesley's fault.
|- Actually, it is.
Faith was your responsibility.
- Guess who's Angel's new playmate?
|- Faith and Angel?
Together?
Imagine the possibilities.
Mornin', sleepyhead.
You know|what I just can't believe?
All of our time together|and we never tried chains.
Well, you can't dwell in the past.
Especially with the future we have ahead.
Bondage looks good on you, B.|The outfit's all wrong, but hey.
- You don't know what you're doing.
|- Really?
Weird.
Cos something about all this|just feels so right.
Maybe it's one of those|"unhappy childhood" things.
See, when I was a kid|I used to beg my mom for a dog.
Didn't matter what kind.
I just wanted,|you know, something to love.
A dog's all I wanted.
Well, that and toys.
But Mom was so busy enjoying|the drinking and passing out parts of life that I never really got|what I wanted.
Until now.
Faith, listen to me very closely.
Angel's a killer.
When he's|done with me, he'll turn on you.
She's right.
I probably will.
Yeah?
I guess we'll just have to|keep you around a while then.
Before we get started,|I just want you to know, if you're a screamer, feel free.
Why, Faith?
What's in it for you?
What isn't?
I come to Sunnydale, I'm a slayer,|I do my job kickin' ass better than anyone.
But what do I hear about everywhere I go?
Buffy.
So I slay, I behave,|I do the good little girl routine, and who does everybody thank?
- Buffy.
|- That's not my fault.
Everyone always asks|"Why can't you be more like Buffy"?
Did anyone ask if you could be more like me?
I know I didn't.
You get the watcher, the mom, the little|Scooby Gang.
What do I get?
Jack squat.
- This was supposed to be my town!
|- Faith, listen to me.
Why?
So you can impart|some special Buffy wisdom, that it?
Do you think you're better than me?
Say it.
- You think you're better than me.
|- I am.
- Always have been.
|- Maybe you didn't notice.
Angel's with me.
And how'd you get him, Faith?
Magic.
You cast some sort of spell?
Because in the real world, Angel|would never touch you, and we both know it.
You had to tie me up to beat me.
|There's a word for people like you, Faith.
"Loser".
You're just trying|to make me mad so I'll kill you.
But I'm too smart for that.
Stick around.
For what?
Your boss's lame Ascension?
Like I couldn't stop it?
- You can't.
|- I will.
Keep dreaming.
No one can stop|the Ascension.
Mayor's got it wired, B. He built this town for demons to feed on,|and come Graduation Day, he's gettin' paid.
And I'll be sitting at his right hand.
Assuming he has hands after the|transformation.
I'm not too clear on that part.
And all your little lame-ass friends|are gonna be Kibbles 'n Bits.
Think about that when|your boyfriend's cuttin' into you.
I never knew you had so much rage in you.
What can I say?
I'm the world's best actor.
Second best.
Graduation Day.
|You think we missed anything?
I think we know everything she knows.
May I say something?
- Psych.
|- You played me.
You played me!
What are you gonna do, B?
|Kill me, you become me.
You're not ready for that yet!
Are you OK?
- The task is finished.
|- Yes.
Thank you for coming to me.
And for that rather effective|light show you put on.
This restores the balance|between us, Rupert Giles.
My debt to you is now repaid in full.
- Do not call upon me again.
|- I shan't.
Peace with you.
And with you.
His debt to you is repaid?
What did you do?
I introduced him to his wife.
Well, I for one protest.
You've pitted slayer|against slayer in a dangerous charade that could have gotten them both killed.
|Without informing me.
- I'm telling the Council.
|- I think you should.
We have a rogue slayer.
- I can't think of anything more dangerous.
|- At least now we know.
And we know a little bit more|about the Ascension.
Graduation Day.
There's a big, scary un-fun.
At least Angel's not bad, though.
|That's good, right?
Yes, I feel so much better knowing|that he broke my face in the "good" way.
- It's a "good" bruise.
|- He was only acting, Xander.
It was just an act.
Well, you win some, you lose some.
|It's batting average that counts.
So you lost some friends.
- I wouldn't exactly call them friends.
|- Then what are you worried about?
Chin up.
You don't see me|looking disappointed.
Know why?
Because I know you'll always have me, Faith,|the most important friend you'll ever have.
Besides, once the Ascension starts,|that "in crowd" you're so concerned about?
They'll be lucky if there's enough|of them left to fill a pothole.
Promise.
Still unhappy?
Okey-doke.
I've got two words that are|gonna make all the pain go away.
"Miniature".
"Golf".
- How you doin'?
|- Been better.
Not hard to believe.
You were a real soldier last night, Buffy.
That's me.
One of the troops.
- I know how hard it was for you.
|- I really doubt that.
If there's anything I can do to make it better Look I know you only did what I asked.
|And we got what we wanted.
I never wanted it to go that far.
I know that.
It's not even a question of that.
It's just after I need a little bit of a break.
Please?
Are you still my girl?
Always.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Previously Want to get your hands on|the Books of Ascension?
You got the books?
We want to take Angel's soul away.
The Mayor's built this town for demons|and, come graduation day, he's gettin' paid.
- Think we missed anything?
|- We know all she knows.
You played me!
- I know you only did what I asked.
|- I never wanted it to go that far.
You demons can't resist|a run-and-stumble, can you?
One down.
One gone.
- Scabby demon got away?
|- Scabby demon number two got away.
Scabby demon number one,|big check in the slay column.
I don't like this no-mouth thing.
|It's disquieting.
Well, no mouth means no teeth.
Unless they have them somewhere else.
Morning, girls.
We've been researching|the Mayor's forthcoming Ascension.
- It's pretty riveting stuff.
|- What do we know?
What don't we know?
- Tell her, Giles.
|- Based on the date, graduation day, ..
and the Mayor being impervious to harm,|I've cross-referenced He's a cross-referencing fool.
..
and eliminated several possibilities.
It's not the ritual flaying|of the demon Azorath, nor the I don't know what's going to happen.
- That was kind of an anticlimax.
|- We don't know anything?
- The Faith-Angel thing was for nothing?
|- No.
If nothing else, Angel's charade has|brought Faith's treachery into the open.
And this information about the Ascension|will prove useful, eventually.
I just need to put it together.
Terribly sorry.
I was detained.
Official Council business.
Mr Giles, you were speaking?
I was filling Buffy in on my progress|on the research of Ascension.
Oh.
And what took up the rest of the minute?
Touché.
Of course my work is unofficial.
I'm sure, however, with the resources|of the Council at your disposal, you will have something to add.
Well, I am pleased to state, with certainty, that the demon Azorath|will not in any way be involved in I'm sure we'll find out more soon.
The demon Azorath?
So, have you talked to Angel lately?
Not really.
Seeing him bad,|even pretend bad and with Faith He only kissed her for the greater good.
I know.
But to the naked eye|it looked like fun.
Or maybe it wasn't.
|Maybe he wasn't even tempted.
- I just wish I could be sure.
|- As always, I advise you to ask.
Like he'd tell me?
Hogan!
- Great game, man.
|- Thanks.
Hogan Martin thinks he's so hot.
Like we should be awed|because he can put a ball in a net.
- Hey, Xander.
|- He said my name.
He knows my name.
- Hey, Willow.
|- Hi.
Look.
I can't make it to|the study session after school today.
- Can we do it fifth period?
|- OK.
Did you finish the reading?
- Most of it.
|- Percy!
- I'll finish it at lunch.
|- That's my little trooper.
What are you doing to him?
|I heard him complete a sentence.
It had a clause and everything.
- Watching the game?
|- Wouldn't miss it.
See ya, Hogan.
Ladies.
You're going?
I didn't know|you liked basketball.
I didn't either, but I've started getting into it.
|Especially now we're in the championships.
Too bad you're patrolling.
|We're all goin'.
Oz, Xander, everybody.
Great.
Everybody who isn't currently Buffy.
- You touched one of the demons?
|- A good touch, not a bad touch.
Anyway, it's been itching like crazy.
No big.
Just another problem for|the good people at Lubriderm, right?
Is this the demon in question?
In the disgusting flesh.
- What?
|- It says it can infect the host.
Infect?
Oh, infect the host with|"an aspect of the demon".
- That's all it says.
|- "An aspect of the demon"?
- It is rather terse, isn't it?
|- You mean, like a part of it?
There could be any number of explanations.
|A new fabric softener can cause irritation.
In any case, I would advise not to|attempt to track the one that got away.
Let's minimise your exposure.
Part of the demon.
|I hope it's not the outside part.
H-O-G-A-N!
It's Hogan!
Go, Hogan!
Is it me, or is this really lame?
I usually enjoy lameness|and this is leavin' me cold.
According to Freddy's latest editorial: "At the pep rally, pseudo-prostitutes|provoke men into a sexual frenzy, which, when thwarted, results|in pointless athletic competition".
- And the downside being?
|- The school paper is edging on depressing.
- Have you guys noticed that?
|- I always go straight to the obits.
- What are you doin', Buffy?
|- Nothing.
Checking for horns.
You know, Buffy I don't even think Giles|is right about you becoming like a demon.
I mean, he's totally burnt, you know?
|Dealing with Faith and this Ascension thing.
Between you and me,|he's not doing his best work.
What if he is right?
I'm gonna grow this|demon part and we don't know what it is.
I mean, it could be claws or scales - What?
|- Was it a boy demon?
T-O-M!
It's Tom!
Go, Tom!
- They really are very good.
|- Their spelling's improved.
You know, Oz, I look at all this beauty,|all these healthy young women, and I wonder why I ever|wasted my time on Cordelia.
Look at her.
She's no|better-looking than the rest.
- None of them are really my|- Oh, my God!
He's lookin' at her.
He's got his filthy adult|Pierce-Brosnany eyes all over my Cordy.
You're a very complex man, aren't you?
It's just I'm scared, Will.
There's this thing in me|and I can't find it.
I can't stop it.
What if it changes me?
|I mean, not just the way I look.
All of a sudden, I could be|something that's not me.
Oh, sorry.
They spelled Percy|and I have to show support.
He's needy.
But I heard you what you were saying.
And I would be frightened too,|but I'm sure you're gonna be OK.
Still got a mouth.
Sorry.
That's OK.
I didn't see you,|so I should have known you were there.
- What are you doing here?
|- It's a dangerous time, you know.
With Faith.
Yeah.
Faith.
She, well Faith,|what can you say about her?
I just want to make sure that you're|you know, OK.
That you're safe.
And the fact that you're right here.
|Does that mean Faith's around?
Are you tracking me or are you tracking her?
I'm tracking you.
Something's bothering you.
A lot of things.
The most recent being this demon.
|Actually, two.
I touched one of them and now I'm gonna|get a big case of the bumpies or a tail.
"Aspect of the demon".
- You know the drill.
|- By rumour.
But that doesn't mean anything.
I mean, sometimes demons,|they exaggerate their power.
Demon hype.
Maybe not.
I spend all my time in the dark here anyway.
It's not like I'd be at a game, with my friends, where someone could see me|in my new monster part.
I won't let anything happen|to you if I can help it.
No matter what, I'll always be with you.
I'll love you, even if|you're covered with slime.
I liked everything until that part.
- Right at the buzzer.
Three points for the win.
|- It was intense.
For a minute I thought|you'd make an expression.
I felt one comin' on, I won't lie.
I've never seen anyone jump like Hogan.
|They should call him The Jumper.
Or a name that isn't an article of|women's clothing.
Hey, remember when the Hm, quietness.
We either lost or we won|and you don't want me to feel bad.
Yeah, it wasn't really a good game.
Tall hoops, but then, tall guys.
|What's the point?
- Pretty dull.
|- Are you crazy?
It was an incredible game.
I've never cheered so hard in my life.
|I still have knee marks on my back.
From the pyramid.
Yeah, well, I still bet patrolling was|way better, cos wow, important.
Well, I thought I saw a four-legged demon.
But it was just a dog.
- A weredog?
|- Regular.
- Tough luck.
|- Yeah.
- I wonder if they've kissed,|- It really bugs you, huh?
- What?
|- Cordelia and Wesley, smooching.
Man, you read my mind.
Whoa, there.
You watch|where you're going now.
I'm sorry, Mr Beech.
I will.
Students, if we could just|get rid of all the students, When I'm a gillionaire and you're|flippin' burgers, who's the loser?
Maybe I'll take French, I said, How hard|can it be?
French babies learn it, Idiot, I swear, some day my pants|are going to fall right off, Buffy's so beautiful,|I mean, look at that body, God, I'd love to shove her against|that locker right now and just ooh!
Is this the thing?
The aspect thing?
|Because it is way better than a tail.
I have a hard time as it is|finding jeans that fit.
Buffy, slow down.
I'm not even convinced that|this is genuine mind-reading.
You're most likely projecting your When I walked in, you thought: "Look at her shoes.
If a fashion magazine told|her to, she'd wear cats strapped to her feet".
I The demons are telepathic!
|That's why they don't need mouths, - Of course.
The demons are telepathic.
|- I know.
You just told me.
That's why they don't need mouths.
|And you should have known.
- This is astounding.
|- I was in the hallway.
The principal has|"Walk Like an Egyptian" in his head.
And the boys of this school|are seriously disturbed.
It's weird, but Giles, think about it.
|Think about what I could do.
It could be very useful.
You could|anticipate your opponent's every move.
- Turn his plans against him.
|- Oh, way better than that!
- Jealousy.
|- Buffy.
Right.
Very good.
- I knew that,|- That's the tool Iago uses to undo Othello.
But what's his motivation?
What reason does Iago give|for destroying his superior officer?
Cassio has my place,|'twixt my sheets he's done my office, He was passed over for promotion.
Cassio was picked instead.
And people were saying|that Othello slept with his wife.
Buffy did the reading?
|Buffy understood the reading?
When did she study?
|Was I supposed to study?
Miss Murray's kinda hot, I was gonna say Cassio, - I hate her,|- Any other reason?
- Race!
|- Good, Nancy.
Can't overlook that.
Look at them scrambling for the teacher's|praise like pigeons for old bread crusts, Will, who's that guy?
It's Freddy Iverson.
He writes those|editorials for the school paper.
He's sardonic.
Bread crusts, that's deep,|I should write that down, Is there something else at work here?
Well, he sort of admits himself|that his motives are spurious?
He does things because he enjoys them.
It's like he's not really a person.
He's the dark half of Othello himself.
Buffy.
Really Very astute.
I said something|quite like that in my dissertation.
I know.
I mean, I agree.
With that.
And doesn't that also explain|Othello's readiness to believe Iago?
Within seconds, he turns on Desdemona.
He believes that she's been unfaithful.
|We're all like that.
We all have our little internal Iagos, that tell us our husbands or our girlfriends,|or whatever, don't really love us.
We can never really see|what's in someone's heart.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry about the daytime.
I just ducked out of school and|that's when they have it!
You look good.
|I mean, I know I saw you last night, but sometimes things can change real quick.
I mean, really quickly.
|Listen to me, I'm talking like Faith.
You know, not that she was|so bad to have around.
You know, before the evil.
You know, I think she was hurting a lot.
And some people, protective-type|people might be drawn to that, I guess.
- Well, the thing about Faith|- You can't get into my mind.
How did you Why not?
It's like the mirror.
The thoughts are there,|but they create no reflection in you.
You got your aspect of the demon.
Yeah.
Giles doesn't know|how long it's gonna last.
- But it's OK.
A little headachy, but|- You don't have to play games with me.
Ever.
- You're not exactly here's-what-I'm-thinkin'.
|- So ask me.
- But that would have made sense.
|- What do you want to know?
Faith?
How I felt kissing her?
Pretending to have no soul?
|Watching you suffer?
- Well, since you bring it up|- I hated hurting you.
More than I can stand.
Look, the thing about Faith I'd understand.
She has that whole|bad-girl thing workin' for her.
Kissing her meant nothing.
I don't want|a bad girl.
I've done that before.
I've lived a long time, Buffy.
|And I'm past that.
I've been with dozens of girls like her.
More.
- Oh, this honesty stuff is fun!
|- And there's no comparison.
In 243 years, I've loved exactly one person.
Who?
It is me, right?
Next time, just ask.
OK.
Buffy, careful with this gift.
A lot of things that seem strong and|good and powerful - they can be painful.
Like, say immortality?
Exactly.
I'm dying to get rid of that.
Funny.
I'm a funny guy.
She can read our minds?
|Our every impulse and fantasy?
- Every one.
|- Oh, God, I don't see what this has to do with me, Well, I think it's great.
I mean,|you enjoy your other slayer powers.
It'll be fun.
Did you see|Nancy's face in class today?
Yeah, She's hardly even human any more, How can I be her friend now?
|She doesn't need me, - No, I do need you.
|- OK.
What are you talking about?
Because you are so creepy right now.
I think there must be some precedents|for occurrences such as this.
I'll research it.
Can you give me a hand?
Of course.
Where should we start?
I am my thoughts, if they exist in her,|Buffy contains all that is me, and she becomes me, I cease to exist, What am I gonna do?
|I think about sex all the time, Sex, Help!
Four times five is thirty, Five times six is thirty-two, Naked girls, Naked women, Naked Buffy, Oh, stop me!
- God, Xander, is that all you think about?
|- Actually Bye.
Xander has just illustrated something.
Chances are, you're all going to be thinking|whatever you least want Buffy to hear.
It's a question of mental discipline.
- He's right.
|- Look at Cordelia!
No, don't look at Cordelia, She's a student, Oh, I am bad,|I'm a bad, bad man, Excuse me.
- What's it like, Buffy?
|- I don't know.
I mean, it's a little weird, but Look, please don't think|I don't need you, because I do.
And I want to share this with you.
It's like all these doors are opening to|all these worlds and I can walk right inside.
No one else exists either,|Buffy is all of us, We think, therefore she is, She knows so much,|She knows what Oz is thinking, I never do, Soon she'll|know him better than I do, - No, don't think that.
|- I can't help it, Buffy.
I'm sorry.
I just can't.
If you don't need me,|I'm going to follow the redhead.
I guess I won't be writing|Winning Friends through telepathy, Whatever, I wonder when I can go?
|Whatever.
Can I go?
Excuse me, can you hear me thinking|in here?
I could go out into the hall.
You know what?
You stay.
|I'm getting a headache.
I'll go.
She is so hot, - I hate my body,|- ..
I'll scream from boredom, - No one'll ever love me,|- What if I never get breasts?
I can't believe the test is today, - I have the worst|- Get rid of the students!
It's that easy, - He has the cutest butt,|- I hate her, Here.
It's happened before.
A man in Ecuador.
Quite recently.
- Can we contact him?
|- I'd say not.
- He can't communicate with anyone.
|- Dead?
No, he's in complete isolation.
The power.
He can't shut it off.
It's gotta get better,|Please, tell me it gets better, I hate school, Am I normal?
Are you through with the mashed potatoes?
She doesn't even know I'm here, Come on, come on!
She has the sweetest face I ever saw, If I stand in just the right place The test is today, This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all, - She's really nuts,|- I hate being here, She touched me!
- I think she's waking up,|- Oh, thank God, - I'm cold,|- Are you all right?
I told them not to move you.
|They probably severed your spinal cord.
I'm OK.
No, really.
I'm OK.
Listen.
There's a killer in the cafeteria.
See?
I've been saying for years the lunch lady|will do us all in with that mulligan stew.
- What the hell's a mulligan?
|- Someone was thinking it.
"This time tomorrow, I'll kill you all".
|I have to find them.
Did you recognise a voice?
- No.
|- Boy or girl?
I don't know.
I mean, it was hardly human.
|It was so full of anger and pain.
- Count.
|- No, I have to find them.
Are you sure they meant it?
Who hasn't idly thought about takin'|out the whole place with a semiautomatic?
- I said idly.
|- I know the difference.
He she whoever, they meant it.
|They're gonna do it.
- She looks so tired,|- How horrible, - I'm not getting any warmer,|- I bet it was Hogan, Shut up!
I'm sorry, I just|Could you guys not think so loud?
- Or so much?
|- You should go home.
I'll take you home.
Yeah, OK.
No.
I need you to go to the|cafeteria.
Make a list of everyone who's there.
- We have to find the killer.
|- We'll do it.
A list of all the students.
Yeah.
Nancy was there, and she's scary.
|Oh, teachers too.
Mr Beech, he thought something|about getting rid of all the students.
I can't shut it out, Giles.
|It's like this invasion of my head.
It's like there are these strangers|walking around in there.
Look at this.
I can't even|be around people any more.
Not that they're clamouring|to be near me anyway.
Even you.
I'm sorry, Buffy.
It's hard for all of us.
But Wesley and I are|looking for a way to help.
But I'll be OK, right?
I mean,|even if you can't get rid of it?
You'll be fine.
I promise.
Hit doesn't go away, she'll go insane, I think we have everyone that was in|the cafeteria.
I'll do some computer work.
Match it against FBI mass-murderer profiles.
|See if maybe we can rule some people out.
I'm having trouble with the fact that one|of us will gun everybody down for no reason.
Because that never happens|in American high schools!
- It's almost trendy at this point.
|- Besides which, Sunnydale High?
The centre of evil and all that?
Let's get to work.
|We have till lunch time tomorrow.
We hope.
There.
You look better already.
- Thanks, Mom.
|- I'm just going to get you another pillow.
- I really don't need one.
|- But you need another blanket.
Mom, I'm fine.
How about some soup?
- Chicken and stars?
|- Mom, please, just come sit with me?
I've I've got laundry.
Why are you You had sex with Giles?
- It was the candy.
We were teenagers.
|- On the hood of a police car?
I'll be downstairs.
You feel better.
Twice?
OK, I've taken our list and|narrowed it down to a dozen suspects.
Here are your assignments.
- I was hoping there'd be assignments.
|- I think I should work with Wesley.
You have no shame.
Like shame is something to be proud of?
Be quiet.
Sorry, but this is important.
OK, talk to everyone on your list.
|And use the sample questions.
Today, people.
Oh, write neatly and label your work sheets.
Fantasies are fun.
Aren't they, Jonathan?
I guess.
We all have fantasies where|we're powerful and respected.
Where people pay attention to us.
Maybe.
But sometimes the fantasy|isn't enough, is it, Jonathan?
Sometimes we have to make it|so people don't ignore us.
Make them pay attention.
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
You want me to pay attention?
- For the yearbook?
|- Personality profiles.
Can you ask it again?
Sure.
Do you ever feel you've created a false|persona - the guy who does everything right?
- How much of a strain does it put on you?
|- Uh, wow.
I guess Moderate strain?
Is that a good answer?
|I wanna get this right.
Yeah, that's good.
Hi, Mr Beech.
I was wondering.
Were|you planning on killing people tomorrow?
Oh, it's for the yearbook.
OK, so turn-offs include smoking,|insensitive men and Birkenstocks.
Now, your idea of the|perfect romantic evening.
Candy, let's start with you.
Freddy?
I should have just quit, Look at him smiling like|he thinks I don't know about her, - I can't believe I'm getting away with this,|- One more drink, that'll do it, Seems to be coming along all right.
Buffy's being driven mad,|we have no proof this will work, and it requires the heart of the second|demon, which we have no idea how to get.
- Negative thinking doesn't solve problems.
|- Who is going to get the demon heart?
Burk.
Do I often imagine classmates are spying|on me or otherwise acting suspiciously?
- Right.
|- Not till just now.
What?
Talk louder, dude.
I'm just saying it's gotta be frustrating.
|Having the secret.
You gotta be kinda filling up with resentment.
|Unexpressed rage just waiting to burst out?
- Today at lunch?
|- What secret?
Being gay?
Man, I'm out.
I'm so out I've got my grandma|fixin' me up with guys.
That's nice.
But it sounds like you're|having a rough time with it?
Look Just do it.
- That Freddy Iverson that does the paper|- He's gay?
No, dude.
But I bet he'd put in like a|coming-out announcement for you.
Something tasteful.
Freddy?
- He's the only one we couldn't find?
|- Freddy Iverson.
The newspaper guy?
But we can't|figure out it's him without the work sheet.
We do have this.
Today's editorial, titled|"Big Game Draws Mindless Braindead Mob".
Does he mention the cheerleaders?
|Because we were on.
I can't stand this.
I keep wondering if I'm|hurting her with my thoughts.
You're not.
Not any more.
She can't pick one thought out of the din.
I got it.
- No.
|- I'm gonna help ya.
Giles!
Angel.
Thank God.
Are you all right?
Do you hear thoughts?
No.
Did you find the killer?
Oh, hey, Oz.
You got me.
- What are you gonna do, hold me down?
|- You'd better believe it, buster.
You can't threaten a big murder|without getting us pretty darn ticked.
Murder?
What murder?
|You're not here about the review?
- The review?
|- Yeah.
Last Thursday.
"Dingoes Ate My Baby play as if they had|Polish sausages taped to their fingers".
Sorry, man.
No, it's fair.
I get a lot of hate mail, and I thought|you were delivering some personally.
If you find any announcements about me - Xander, we have to figure this out.
|- We have no shot.
It could be anyone.
We lose.
We still have a few minutes.
You're OK!
Can you hear thoughts?
- Just when I wasn't thinkin' about sex.
|- OK, here's the new plan.
We're going to get Snyder|to evacuate the school.
"By tomorrow, you'll all know what I've done.
|I'm sure you understand that I had to do it, and that although death is|never easy, it's the only way".
God!
Doesn't anyone write in|to praise the cheerleaders?
- We are so unsung.
|- Jonathan.
Oh!
I had him in my grasp.
- Slippery weasel.
|- Split up.
Find him.
Jonathan?
Are you in here?
Jonathan!
Jello.
I could have done that.
Get away from me.
OK, Jonathan, do you wanna|point that somewhere else?
Don't you try and stop me.
No.
No stopping.
Just here for the view.
Hey, look.
City Hall.
Go away.
- Never gonna happen.
|- You think I won't use this?
- I don't know, Jonathan.
I just|- Stop doin' that.
Doing what?
Stop saying my name like we're friends.
We're not friends.
You all think I'm an idiot.
A short idiot.
I don't.
I don't think about you much at all.
Nobody here really does.
Bugs you, doesn't it?
You have all this pain and all these feelings,|and nobody's really paying attention.
You think I just want attention?
No, I think you're up in the clock tower|with a rifle because you want to blend in!
Believe it or not, Jonathan,|I understand about the pain.
Oh, right.
Because the burden of being|beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler!
You know what?
I was wrong.
|You are an idiot.
My life happens to, on occasion,|suck beyond the telling of it.
Sometimes more than I can handle.
And it's not just mine.
Every person down there is ignoring your|pain because they're too busy with their own.
Beautiful ones, popular ones, the guys that pick on you Everyone.
If you could hear what they were feeling.
|The loneliness, the confusion.
It looks quiet down there.
It's not.
It's deafening.
You know I could have taken that by now?
I know.
I'd rather do it this way.
I just wanted it to stop.
Yeah, well, mass murder?
|Not recommended for that kind of pain.
And prison is like school,|only instead of noogies - What are you talking about?
|- Actions having consequences.
That stuff.
I wouldn't ever hurt anybody.
I came up here to kill myself, Rat poison!
Step away from the food.
- OK, let's calm down.
|- Vermin.
You're all vermin.
You come in here|and you eat and you eat filth.
I don't see this being settled with logic.
- So you're feeling better about Angel?
|- Well, we talked.
Then he ripped out the heart of a demon|and fed it to me.
Then we talked some more.
See?
That's how it should work.
- Morning.
|- Hi, Giles.
I'll go to the yearbook office to give them the|murderer profiles.
They're really a good read.
- Bye.
|- See ya.
- How are you?
|- Lovin' the quiet.
Nobody in here but me.
- Jonathan, how's he?
|- Pretty crappy.
His parents are freaking,|he got suspended, and toting a piece - not winning him a place with the in-crowd.
|But I think he's dealing.
It was good of you to check on him.
Well, it's nice to be able to help someone|in a non-slaying capacity.
Except he's starting to get that look,|like he's gonna ask me to prom.
- It'd probably boost his self-esteem if you|- What am I?
St Buffy?
He's like three feet tall.
I'm glad to see you've recovered|from your psychic encounter intact.
- Feel up to some training?
|- Sure.
After school.
You know - if you're not too busy|having sex with my mother.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - I'm Faith.
|- I'd say there's a new slayer in town.
- You don't get it.
You killed a man.
|- No, you don't get it.
I don't care.
She's unstable, Buffy.
You sent your boy to kill me.
He's dust.
|I guess that means you have a job opening.
How'd you like to get your hands|on the Books of Ascension?
Have you got the books?
- What's this Ascension mean?
|- Mayor Wilkins is over 100.
He's not human.
Nothing can harm me until the Ascension.
We've a rogue slayer on our hands.
|That's dangerous.
There's a word for|people like you, Faith: loser.
No one can stop the Ascension.
|Mayor's got it wired, B. He built this town for demons to feed on|and on graduation day he'll be paid.
Stick around.
All right.
You can open them up now.
Fab.
What's the occasion?
Faith.
As if I need a reason|to show you my affection, or appreciation for running|a small errand at the airport.
Airport?
What's next?
Want me to help|a buddy of yours move a sofa?
This isn't a free ride, young lady.
I'm beginning to think|somebody's getting a little spoiled.
- Maybe I should take this back.
|- Sorry.
- Sir.
|- That's my girl.
Another cookie?
Now, a package is arriving tomorrow night.
Something - and I can't stress this enough -|crucially important to my Ascension.
Without it Well, what would Toll House cookies be|without the chocolate chips?
A pretty darn big disappointment,|I can tell you.
Open your present.
There.
That look on your face is my reward.
- This is a thing of beauty, boss.
|- Well, it cost a pretty penny.
So, you just take good care of it.
And you be careful not to put|somebody's eye out with that thing.
Until I tell you to.
Any particular eyes in mind?
Sorry, honey.
That's OK.
There's something you don't see every day.
- Unless, of course, you're me.
|- That was bracing.
- Wanna do another sweep?
|- It's what I live for.
Sad to say.
- You too tired?
|- No.
It's just D'you get the feeling|that we're kind of in a rut?
- A rut?
|- You never take me any place new.
What about that fire demon nest|in the cave by the beach?
I thought that was a nice change of pace.
So this is our future?
This is how we're gonna spend our nights|when I'm 50 and you're the same age you are now?
- Let's just get you to 50.
|- Likin' that plan.
Buffy?
When were you gonna tell me?
All right.
Busted.
|I didn't think you'd miss them.
You were accepted to|Northwestern University?
Honey, I am so proud of you.
|That's wonderful.
Right.
It's wonderful.
I mean, it's not cheap, but I know|we can make it work if your father pitches in.
Not that Northwestern is your only option.
It's a great school though.
|I am so proud of you.
- You said that before.
|- And will again soon.
Mom, you know that I can't I just can't decide on the school right now.
I mean, I wanna sleep on it, mull it over.
Raise 'em up my inner flagpole.
|See which one I salute.
I know, sweetheart.
I'm just so pleased|that you have so many choices.
Your Aunt Arlene and her family|are in Illinois.
I've got to call and tell them.
- Buffy?
|- I know.
You're proud of me.
Don't forget to put my earrings|back in my dresser before you go out.
Arlene?
Hi, it's Joyce.
How you doin'?
You are never gonna believe|where Buffy got accepted to school.
- Here you go.
|- Thanks.
- OK, what's in the bag?
|- My lunch.
- Is that the new drug lingo?
|- No, it's my lunch.
Sit up straight.
- Sounds like your mom's in a state of denial.
|- More like a continent.
- She just has to realise that I can't go away.
|- Well, maybe not now, but soon.
Maybe.
Or maybe I, too, hail from denial land.
Faith's turn to the dark side of the force|put the kibosh on any away plans for me.
UC Sunnydale.
At least I got in.
|I can't believe you got into Oxford.
- It's pretty exciting.
|- Get into some deep academia there.
- That's where they make Gileses.
|- I know.
I could learn and have scones.
Although, I don't know how I feel about|going to school in a foreign county.
"Everything in life is foreign territory".
Kerouac.
He's my teacher.
- The open road: my school.
|- Making the open dumpster your cafeteria?
- Go ahead, mock me.
|- I think she just did.
We bohemian types|have always been persecuted.
Well, sure.
You're all so weird.
I think it's neat, you doin' the backpack,|trail mix, "Happy Wanderer" thing.
I'm aware it scores high on the hokey meter.
|But it'll help me to find myself.
And we'll lose you.
Everyone's a winner.
Well, look who just popped open|a fresh can of venom.
- Hear about Willow gettin' into Oxnard?
|- Oxford.
And MIT and Yale, and every other college on|the face of the planet, as in your face, I rub it.
Oxford?
Whoopee.
Four years in tea-bag central.
|Sounds thrilling.
MIT is a Clearasil ad and Yale is a dumping|ground for those who didn't get into Harvard.
I got into Harvard.
Know where you're going so we can|start calculating minimum safe distance?
- None of your business.
Not near you losers.
|- Don't forget to breathe between insults.
I'm sorry, Buffy.
This conversation is|reserved for those who actually have a future.
- An angry young woman.
|- She was just being Cordelia.
Only more so.
- Don't pay any attention.
|- She's got a chip goin'.
- Maybe if you didn't goad her so much.
|- Can't help it.
It's my nature.
Maybe you need a better nature.
- I don't understand.
|- I can't talk any slower, Wes.
I wanna leave.
- What, now?
|- No, not now.
After I graduate.
College?
But you're a slayer.
Yeah.
I'm also a person.
|You can't just define me by my slayerness.
That's something-ism.
- Buffy, we've talked about you going away|- I got into Northwestern.
- That's wonderful news.
Good for you.
|- All right, everyone.
Monsters, demons, world in peril?
- I bet they have all that stuff in Illinois.
|- You cannot leave Sunnydale.
With the power invested in me|by the Council, I forbid it.
Oh, yes, that should settle it.
With Faith gone bad|and the Ascension coming up I know it's complicated.
I am aware|that my graduation may be posthumous.
But what if I stop the Ascension?
|What if I capture Faith?
- I hope you will.
|- If I do that, then all you have to do is kill the unholy forces through midterms,|and I'll be back for homecoming and every school break after that.
- At least think about it.
|- If circumstances were different - I'll make them different.
|- What?
I'm tired of waiting for the Mayor's move,|while we just count down to Ascension Day.
- Let's take the fight to him.
|- No.
No.
Much too reckless.
We're at a disadvantage.
We know|nothing about the Mayor's Ascension.
She's right.
Time's running out.
|We need to take the offensive.
What's your plan?
I gotta have a plan?
Really?
I can't just be proactive with pep?
If you want to take the fight to them,|the first step is to find out what they're up to.
I actually knew that.
I thought you meant|a more specific plan with maps.
Great.
We'll find out what they're up to.
- Is he in the car?
|- No.
I'll take you to him.
The Mayor was supposed to|be here in person with the money.
Well, the price just went up.
|I don't like surprises.
Surprise.
- You killed him.
|- You the narrator?
Get the keys to the cuffs.
Nothin'.
That won't cut through steel.
No.
It'll cut through bone.
There it is.
What happened to the courier?
|I was supposed to pay him.
I made him an offer he couldn't survive.
You are one heck of a girl.
You know that?
I mean, jeez, the initiative, the skill.
- Go on.
Go on.
|- I will.
You know, if Buffy Hey, hey, hey, hey!
If Buffy said she wanted|to switch to our side, I'd say "No, thanks, sister.
I got|all the slayer one man could ever need".
- What?
|- Nothing.
It's cos I used the B word, huh?
Don't tell me you're still sore|about that Angel/Buffy thing.
No, I'm over it.
She can have him.
Better believe she can.
She deserves|that poor excuse for a creature of the night.
You, on the other hand, can do better.
Don't do that.
So?
What's in the box?
Box of Gavrok.
It houses a demonic energy|which His Honour needs to eat come A-Day.
- What's that?
|- Maps and stuff.
Plans for City Hall.
They were in|the water and power mainframe.
The box is being kept|under guard on the top floor.
There.
It's all I could get out of my informant before|he forced me to introduce him to Mr Pointy.
- Well, here's what I think we should do.
|- We'll go through the skylight.
I'll take Angel.
- Agreed.
|- There's a fire ladder on the east side here.
- Yes, fine.
But we still need to consider|- It won't be enough to simply have the box.
Right.
We have to destroy it - not just|physically, ritually.
With some black magic.
Hang on.
We don't know|what such a ritual requires.
I think the Breath of the Atropyx is standard|for this sort of thing.
Fairly simple recipe.
- Xander.
|- I know.
I'm Ingredient-Gettin' Guy.
All right.
Stop.
I demand everyone stop this instant.
I'm in charge here.
And I say|this is all moving much too fast.
We need time to analyse the situation|and devise a proper and strategic stratagem.
Wes, hop on the train or get off the tracks.
The Mayor will most assuredly have|supernatural safeguards protecting the box.
We all forgot about that, did we?
Looks like a job for Wiccan Girl.
|What do you say?
Big-time danger.
- Hey, I eat danger for breakfast.
|- But panics in the face of breakfast foods.
Let's get to work.
I have a theory.
Your snide remarks earlier?
I'm guessing grapes a little on the sour side.
Didn't get into any schools.
|The grades were there, but, ooh, if it weren't for|that pesky interview.
The admissions department decided they'd|reached their superficial-princess quotas.
And once again the gold medal|in the Being Wrong event goes to Xander|"I'm as stupid as I look" Harris.
Read 'em and weep, creep.
|USC, Colorado State, Duke and Columbia.
Wow.
These are great colleges.
I'm guessing they must have seen|a different side of your father's money.
- Go away.
|- Sure.
I have to go back|to helping to save some lives.
Cary on.
I know that you have|some important accessorising to do.
Now, remember: if anything should go awry,|Wesley and I will create a diversion.
Let's synchronise our watches.
I have 21:4 - Yes.
Typical.
|- We could just count.
One-1,000, two-1,000.
Be careful.
All of you.
Tea?
- You got the goods?
|- Yeah.
Essence of toad.
Twice-blessed sage.
- Or maybe that's the toad.
|- We better be sure.
- Destroying this box is a delicate operation.
|- Then they shouldn't leave it in our hands.
Well, Will laid it out for us pretty well.
Wow.
She even drew helpful diagrams.
|That's the pedestal.
And the ingredients.
And us.
|See, there's you, there's me.
How can you tell which is which?
|They both look stick-figurey to me.
- Well, this one's me with the little guitar.
|- Gotcha.
- Yeah.
Nobody like my Will.
|- No, sir, there is not.
OK.
Toad me.
Thanks.
- Oh, yeah.
I'm bad.
|- Four stars, Will.
- Now get goin'.
|- I'm gone.
Got it.
- Angel?
|- It's jammed.
I'd like very much to come up now, please.
- Angel.
|- I know.
Don't suppose you wanna help me down?
Didn't think so.
Well, this is very unfortunate.
I just had this conference room|redecorated, for Pete's sake.
At taxpayers' expense.
And, oh, yeah, they've got my box.
Yeah, they do.
But lookee what we got.
How did you guys let this?
- How did this happen?
|- They thought she stayed with you.
They must have grabbed her|when she hit the ground.
Buffy, I'm sorry.
Look, it's nobody's fault, OK?
|We just need to focus and deal.
Oz, I swear I won't let them hurt her.
- We go back.
Full-on assault.
|- They'll kill her.
- We're assuming they haven't already?
|- No.
No, they know what she means to us.
She's too valuable|as long as we still have the box.
We trade.
- We can't.
|- It's the safest plan.
It's the only way, right?
It might well be.
- We arrange a meeting.
|- This box must be destroyed.
- I need a volunteer to hit Wesley.
|- Giles, you know I'm right.
- Wanna duck and cover at this point?
|- Dammit, you listen to me.
This box is the key to the Mayor's Ascension.
Thousands of lives|depend upon our getting rid of it.
Now, I want to help Willow as much as|the rest of you, but we will find another way.
There is no other way.
You are the one who said take|the fight to the Mayor.
You were right.
This is the town's best hope of survival.
|It's your chance to get out.
You think I care about that?
|Are you made of human parts?
- All right.
Let's deal with this rationally.
|- Are you taking his side?
Listen to you people.
You'd sacrifice|thousands of lives, your families, friends?
It can all end right here.
|We have the means to destroy this box.
Giles, make the phone call.
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a sucking candy cos my mouth gets dry when I'm nervous|or held prisoner against my will.
And suddenly I'm thinking "sucking"|isn't a good word to use around vampires.
Hey, did you get permission|to eat the hostage?
I don't think so.
You're gonna be in some trouble|when the Mayor Just a little taste.
They're not brain-damaged enough|to come back tonight.
- Ever had a dog?
|- What?
I did.
Rusty.
Irish setter.
Swell little pooch.
A dog's friendship is stronger than reason,|stronger than its sense of self-preservation.
Buffy's like a dog.
And before you can say "Jack Robinson",|you'll get to see me kill her like one.
Whoa.
The Books of Ascension, - Check out the bookworm.
|- Faith.
Anybody with brains, anybody|who knew what was gonna happen to her, would try to claw her way out of this place.
But you?
You just can't stop|Nancy Drew-ing, can ya?
I guess now you know too much,|and that kinda just naturally leads to killin'.
Faith, wait.
I wanna talk to you.
Yeah, give me the speech again.
"Faith,|we're still your friends.
We can help you".
- "It's not too late".
|- It's way too late.
You know, it didn't have to be this way,|but you made your choice.
I know you had a tough life.
I know that some|people think you had a lot of bad breaks.
Well, boo-hoo.
Poor you.
You know, you had a lot more|in your life than some people.
I mean, you had friends like Buffy.
Now you have no one.
You were a slayer and now you're nothing.
You're just a big, selfish, worthless waste.
You hurt me.
I hurt you.
I'm just a little more efficient.
- And I thought you didn't have a comeback.
|- You're beggin' for some deep pain.
I'm not afraid of you.
Let's see what we can do about that.
Girls?
I hope I don't|have to separate you two.
Faith, play with your new toy later.
|Something's come up.
Faith.
You know I don't like repeating myself.
I got someone.
I got him.
I just received a heck of|an interesting phone call.
The whole place is locked down,|except for the front.
Yeah.
It gives me that|comforting "trapped" feeling.
One way out means one way in.
|I wanna see him coming.
I guess they're shy.
I can see all right.
Well, this is exciting, isn't it?
You know, clandestine meetings by|dark of night, exchange of prisoners.
I just I feel like we should|all be wearing trench coats.
Let her go.
No.
Not until the box is in my hands.
So you're the little girl|that's been causing me all this trouble.
She's pretty, Angel.
A little skinny.
I still don't understand why|it couldn't work out with you and my Faith.
- Guess you have strange taste in women.
|- What can I say?
I like 'em sane.
Angel.
I wish you kids the best, but|if you don't mind a bit of fatherly advice, I just don't see much of a future for you two.
|I don't sense a lasting relationship.
Not just because I plan to kill the both of you,|but you got a bumpy road ahead.
I don't think we need to talk about this.
God, you kids, you know You don't like to think about the future.
|You don't like to make plans.
But unless you want Faith to gut your friend|like a sea bass, show respect for your elders.
You're not my elder.
|I got a lot of years on you.
That's just one of the things|you'll have to deal with.
You're immortal.
She's not.
It's not easy.
I married my Edna Mae in '03|and I was with her right until the end.
Not a pretty picture.
Wrinkled and senile|and cursing me for my youth.
It wasn't our happiest time.
And let's forget the fact that any moment|of true happiness will turn you evil.
I mean, what kind of a life can you offer her?
I|don't see a lot of Sunday picnics in the offing.
I see skulking in the shadows,|hiding from the sun.
She's young.
You wanna keep her from the|life she should have until it's passed her by.
By God, I think that's a little selfish.
Is that what you came back from Hell for?
Is that your greater purpose?
Make the trade.
- Well, that went|- Nobody moves.
I knew you kids were up to something.
- Snyder, get out of here.
|- You're not giving orders, young lady.
I suppose you're gonna tell me|I won't find drugs in this box.
- Wait.
|- Principal Snyder?
- I think we have a problem.
|- Mr Mayor.
I had no idea you - I'm terribly sorry.
|- No, it's I who should apologise.
I mean, coming down here at night.
|What must you be thinking?
But, you see, I just needed to|No, don't do that.
- Oh, God.
|- Where'd it go?
Get the door open.
No.
You can't let that thing out of here.
- I still wanna know where it went.
|- Listen.
Boss.
I wouldn't leave that open.
No.
- Is that all of 'em?
|- Not really.
There's about 5O billion of these happy|little critters in here.
Would you like to see?
Raise your hand if you're invulnerable.
Faith, let's go.
Faith.
Snyder, you alive in there?
You.
All of you.
Why couldn't you be dealing drugs|like normal people?
Well, that went swimmingly.
We did all right.
So Faith said "I'm gonna beat you up"|and I'm all "I'm not afraid".
Then she had the knife, which was less fun.
|Then I told her "Buffy was your friend" Yes, this is fascinating,|but just to get back to the point.
You actually had your hands on|the Books of Ascension?
Volumes one through five.
Is there anything that you can remember|that could be of use to us?
Anything at all?
Well, I was in a hurry,|and what I did read was kind of involved - if you ask me, way overwritten.
Actually, there were a few pages that were|interesting, but I couldn't read them fully.
See what you can make of them.
This is your night for suave, Will.
|You should get captured more often.
No, thank you.
Well, let's hope there's|something useful in those pages.
The Mayor has the Box of Gavrok.
And, as of now, we are right back|where we started.
Wouldn't you say?
Deep thoughts?
Deep and meaningful.
As in?
As in, I'm never getting out of here.
I kept thinking "If I stop the Mayor" I was kidding myself.
And there's always gonna be something.
I'm a Sunnydale girl.
No other choice.
It must be tough.
I mean,|here I am, I can do anything I want.
I can go to any college in the county.
|Four or five in Europe, if I want.
- Tell me you're going somewhere with this.
|- No.
I'm not going anywhere.
UC Sunnydale?
- I will be matriculating with the class of 2003.
|- Are you serious?
Say, isn't that where you're going?
I can't believe it.
Are you serious?
|Wait.
What am I saying?
You can't.
- What do you mean, I can't?
|- I won't let you.
Of the two people here,|which is the boss of me?
- There are better schools.
|- Sunnydale's not bad.
And I can design my own curriculum.
OK, well, there are safer schools.
|There are safer prisons.
- I can't let you stay because of me.
|- Actually, this isn't about you.
Although I'm fond -|don't get me wrong - of you.
The other night, you know,|being captured and all, facing off with Faith, things just kinda got clear.
I mean, you've been fighting evil here|for three years.
And I've helped some.
And now we're supposed to decide|what we wanna do with our lives.
And I just realised that's what I wanna do -|fight evil, help people.
I mean, I think it's worth doing.
And|I don't think you do it because you have to.
It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in.
I kinda love you.
Besides, I have a shot at being a bad-ass|Wicca.
And what better place to learn?
I feel the need for more sugar|than I can handle.
- Mochas?
|- Yes, please.
It's weird.
You look at something and think|you know exactly what you're seeing, and and then you find out it's something else.
- Neat, huh?
|- Sometimes it is.
Chase, your break's|been over for ten minutes.
I still need you to re-stock the shelves|and sweep out the storage room.
Let's go.
It's gonna be fun.
Will and I are gonna go|on Saturday and look at the campus.
I'm hoping that Mom'll let me live there.
|It's too far to come home every night.
Plus, the whole lack-of-cool factor.
Either way, I'll be close to your place.
I don't know what|the Mayor was talking about.
- How could he know anything about us?
|- Well, he's evil.
Big time.
He doesn't know|what a lasting relationship is.
No.
Probably the only lasting relationship|he's ever had is with evil.
Yeah.
Big, stupid, evil guy.
We'll be OK.
We will.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
What?
Do I have funny|bed-hair or something?
Or something.
I guess we got a little carried away|with the whole post-slayage nap thing.
Not good.
- Where you goin'?
|- To go kill the cat on my head.
No mirrors.
This place really isn't girl-friendly.
|No mirrors, no natural light.
- I think you look perfect.
|- Yeah.
I really look OK.
Maybe we should think about|getting a few mirrors.
And maybe a drawer, you know,|for some of my stuff.
Because that's what couples do.
|They have drawers.
That's right.
You know, I figure that way|sometimes I can spend the night.
Like after the prom,|it'd be nice to be able to just come back here|and spend some time together.
The prom?
End of high school, rite-of-passage thingy.
Think cotillion with spiked punch|and electric slide.
- Right.
|- Don't worry, it's at night.
And lots of girls have older boyfriends.
You'll blend.
I think maybe you should get goin', huh?
No.
There must be|a few more hours before sunrise.
Sorry.
I guess it's later than we thought.
Xander.
It's Demon Anya, punisher of evil males.
|Still haven't got your powers back?
- You haven't, right?
|- No.
I will, though.
It's just a matter of time.
So, how did that work?
Women would wish|horrible things on their ex-boyfriends.
- You'd show up and make it happen.
|- That's right.
The power of the wish made me|a righteous sword to smite the unfaithful.
Well, good luck with that.
|Hope it works out for you.
You can laugh, but I have seen a millennium|of treachery and oppression from men, and I have only contempt|for the whole lot of them.
Then why are you talkin' to me?
I don't have a date for the prom.
Well, gosh.
I wonder why not?
It couldn't|have anything to do with your sales pitch?
Men are evil.
Will you go with me?
One of us is very confused,|and I honestly don't know which.
- This happens to be all your fault.
|- My fault?
You were unfaithful to Cordelia, so I posed|as a 12th-grader to tempt her with the wish.
When I lost my powers, I got stuck in this|persona and now I have all these "feelings".
I don't understand it.
But I wanna go to this|dance and I want someone to go with me.
Be still my heart.
Wait.
It is.
How come I got the short straw?
You're not quite as obnoxious|as most of the alpha males around here.
- Plus you don't have a date.
|- I haven't settled on anyone.
Fine.
I know you find me attractive.
|I've seen you looking at my breasts.
When a guy does that,|it just means his eyes are open.
Whatever.
Do you wanna go with me or not?
Anya, huh?
Interesting choice.
"Choice" is kind of a broad term|for my situation.
See, it's either Anya|or the sock puppet of love for this boy.
I love you, Xander.
I'll never leave you.
If Anya tries to get you killed,|put me down for a big "I told you so".
Who's this Anya?
Is she prettier than me?
She just better not try to cross me,|that's all I'm saying.
At least we all have someone to go with now.
Some of us will go with demons,|but I think that's a valid lifestyle choice.
- More importantly, I have the kick dress.
|- The pink one?
Angel's gonna lose it.
But not his soul.
|I mean, he's gonna lose his bit.
- Mrs Summers.
|- I'm sorry to I would have called,|but I didn't have your number.
Please.
You're always welcome.
My goodness.
Your place is amazing.
Yeah.
I like a lot of space.
|I don't get out much in the day.
No.
You wouldn't.
Can I get you something?
|I don't have any coffee.
No, thank you.
You don't drink?
Beverages, I mean.
No, I do.
It's just the caffeine.
|It makes me jittery.
- I understand Buffy spent the night.
|- I'm sorry about that.
- We came back after patrolling|- I'm not interested in the details.
OK.
I'm here because I'm worried|about you two, in general.
What happened before, when I changed,|it won't happen again.
That's not all I'm concerned about.
I don't have to tell you that|you and Buffy are from different worlds.
No, you don't.
She's had to deal with a lot.
Grow up fast.
Sometimes even I forget|that she's still just a girl.
And I'm old enough to be her ancestor.
She's just starting out in life.
I know.
I think about it more now|that she's staying in Sunnydale.
Good.
Because when it comes to you, Angel, she's|just like any other young woman in love.
You're all she can see of tomorrow.
But I think we both know|that there are some hard choices ahead.
If she can't make them, you're gonna have to.
I know you care about her.
I just hope you care enough.
- So it was blue and sort of short?
|- Not too short.
Medium.
- And it had weird fringy stuff on its arms.
|- What's that?
A demon?
A prom dress Will wants to get.
Can't you|ever get your mind out of the Hellmouth?
I'd be delighted to, but the Mayor's Ascension|is nearing and we don't know what to expect.
What about the pages Will stole?
She put her|life on the line.
Don't tell me they're useless.
Not at all.
We know the Ascension refers|to a human transforming into a demon, into the living embodiment of an immortal.
And Graduation Day, Mayor Wilkins|is scheduled to do just that.
But we don't know|which demon he's going to become.
There are thousands of species.
So it's safe to say we shouldn't waste time|on such trifling matters as a school dance.
That's too bad, because I bet|you would look way 007 in a tux.
Except on the actual night, when I will be|aiding Mr Giles in his chaperoning duties.
What?
Excuse me?
Fine, fine.
We'll get you a dress.
|We should check April Fools.
Don't go there.
I shop there.
I am dipping into|my hard-earned road-trip fund, to procure a shiny new tux,|so look for me to dazzle.
I shall wear pink taffeta, as chenille|will not go with my complexion.
Can we please talk about the Ascension?
Giles, we get it.
Miles to go before we sleep.
But especially if we're gonna|vaporise on Graduation Day, we deserve a little prommie fun.
One night of glory - not too much to ask.
Into this holy estate, these two persons|present now come to be joined.
If any man can show just cause why they|should not be lawfully joined together, let him speak now Angel?
Patrol's not complete|without a trip to the stinky sewers.
- I'm sure I saw him come down here.
|- We could let this be the vamp that got away.
- We could say he was this big.
|- What can I say?
I need closure.
You need clothes.
|You don't have a tux, do you?
Since when did patrolling go black tie?
For the prom, silly.
We have more important things|to think about than a dance.
Sorry, Giles.
I'll just be quiet.
Come on.
Don't be that way.
Not now.
I'm not being "that way".
Every time|I say the word "prom", you get grouchy.
I'm sorry.
I'm just worried that you're|getting too invested in this whole thing.
What whole thing?
Isn't this the stuff|that I'm supposed to get invested in?
Going to a formal, graduating, growing up?
I know.
Then what?
What's with the dire?
It's - It's nothing.
|- No, you have "something" face.
I think we need to talk.
But not now, not here.
No.
No, if you have|something to say, then say it.
Angel, drop the cryptic.
You're scaring me.
I've been thinking about our future.
And the more I do, the more I feel like "us", you and me being together is unfair to you.
Is this about what the Mayor said?
- Because he was just trying to shake us up.
|- He was right.
No.
No, he wasn't.
He's the bad guy.
You deserve more.
You deserve something|outside of demons and darkness.
You should be with someone|who can take you into the light.
- Someone who can make love to you.
|- I don't care about that.
You will.
And children Children?
Can you say|"jumping the gun"?
I kill my goldfish.
Today.
But you have no idea|how fast it goes, Buffy.
- Before long, you'll want it all.
A normal life.
|- I'll never have a normal life.
Right.
You'll always be a slayer.
All the more reason why you should have a|real relationship instead of this freak show.
- I didn't mean that.
|- I'm gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Buffy, you know how much|I love you.
It kills me to say this.
Then don't.
Who are you|to tell me what's right for me?
- You think I haven't thought about this?
|- Have you?
Rationally?
No, of course not.
I'm just|some swoony little schoolgirl, right?
I'm trying to do what's right.
I'm trying|to think with my head instead of my heart.
Heart?
You have a heart?
It isn't even beating.
- Don't.
|- Don't what?
Don't love you?
I'm sorry.
You know what?
|I didn't know that I got a choice in that.
I'm never gonna change.
I can't change.
I want my life to be with you.
I don't.
You don't wanna be with me?
I can't believe you're breaking up with me.
It doesn't mean that I don't How am I supposed to stay away from you?
I'm leaving.
After the Ascension.
After it's finished with the Mayor and Faith.
If we survive, I'll go.
- Where?
|- I don't know.
Is this really happening?
So, that's it?
That's it.
Assuming we survive this|Ascension thing, he's gonna leave town.
Well, he's a fool.
He's just a big, dumb|jerk-person, if you ask me.
And he's a super-maxi jerk|for doing it right before the prom.
That's not his fault.
He's 243 years old.
|He doesn't exactly get the prom.
- But he should.
|- Will, it's OK.
You don't have to make him the bad guy.
But that's the best friend's job.
|Vilifying and grousing.
Usually, yeah.
But he's right.
I mean, I think maybe|in the long run that he's right.
Yeah.
I think he is.
I mean, I tried to hope for the best, but I'm sorry.
It must be horrible.
I think "horrible" is still coming.
Right now, it's worse.
Right now, I'm just trying to keep from dying.
Oh, Buffy.
I can't breathe, Will.
I feel like I can't breathe.
OK, how long does it take you|to buy a damn dress?
Xander.
I'm considering things|a little more carefully nowadays.
I don't wanna get stuck with another dud.
This should work for ya.
|It positively screams "nympho".
Is this a customer or a friend?
Neither.
Just stopped by|for my daily helping of bile.
So you better get back to work and quit|goofing.
Mrs Finkle so has it in for you.
You work here?
Yes.
Yes, I work here.
But why?
I'm trying to buy a dress.
- But don't you already have all the dresses?
|- I have nothing, OK?
No dresses.
No cellphone.
No car.
Everything has been taken away because|Daddy made a little mistake on his taxes for the last 12 years.
Satisfied?
Are you a happy Xander now?
I'm broke.
I can't go to any|of the colleges that accepted me, and I can't stay home|cos we no longer have one.
Yeah.
Neato.
Now you can run along and tell|all of your friends how Cordy finally got hers.
How she has to work part time|just to get a lousy prom dress on layaway.
And how she has to wear a name tag.
I'm a name-tag person.
Don't leave that out.
|The story wouldn't have the same punch.
You say the creature just stopped?
Yeah.
Right there.
It's like he just realised he forgot|to put money in the meter.
The other part that totally weirded me out?
|The thing had good taste.
He chucked Xander|and went right for the formalwear.
That's right.
He left behind|his copy of Monsters' Wear Daily, I'm serious.
Look at the outfit|that Xander's wearing.
Now look at the kid|that the monster went after.
Very smooth lines till he was shredded.
I don't wanna see it again.
Buffy, it's horrible, but if you're gonna hunt|this creature, you should study it.
- I think I got it.
|- She's right.
I mean, you've seen one big, hairy|bringer of death, you've seen 'em all.
Not really.
If I'm not mistaken,|this is a Hell Hound.
Yes.
It's particularly vicious.
It's a sort of a demon foot soldier|bred during the Makhash Wars.
Trained solely to kill.
|They feed off the brains of their foes.
Look.
Right there.
Zoom in on that.
- It's a video tape.
|- So?
They do it on television all the time.
- Not with a regular VCR they don't.
|- Could we stay on the topic for once?
What were you doing with Xander?
What?
- I was|- Burning a hole in Daddy's wallet, as usual.
I just bumped into her|during my tuxedo hunt.
- What's that?
Pause it.
|- Guys!
It's just a normal VCR.
It doesn't Wait.
It can do "pause".
Hello, Hell Hound raiser.
Tucker Wells.
He was in my chem lab.
Let me guess.
He was quiet, kept to himself,|but always seemed like a nice young man.
He didn't seem the murderous type, anyway.
|Something must have happened to him.
How's it goin' over there, Buff?
Fine.
I just wanted to say that your impersonation|of an inanimate object is really coming along.
Thanks.
I got into Tucker's e-mail account.
Listen to this message Tucker sent to|this kid, David Metz, at school last week.
"The Sunnydale High lemmings|have no idea what awaits them".
"Their big night will be their last night".
So we have a threat against|the students on their big night.
A Hell Hound trained|to attack people in formalwear.
Are we all catching up now?
This Tucker is planning|to attack the prom tonight.
The Hellmouth puts|the "special" in "special occasion".
Why do I even buy tickets|for these things, I ask you?
I wonder if I can take my dress back.
- Don't you dare.
|- But Tucker's gonna No.
You guys are gonna have a prom.
|The kind of prom that everyone should have.
I'm gonna give you all|a nice, fun, normal evening, if I have to kill every single person|on the face of the earth to do it.
Yay?
Wes, you go to Tucker's house.
|He's probably not there, but it's worth a shot.
- All right.
Perhaps strength in numbers|- You can take Cordy.
If that's your plan, all right.
What about the others?
Oz, you know this David kid.
|Why don't you and Will track him down?
- See what he knows if he's involved.
|- We're on it.
And could you two check the magic shop?
- Magic shop?
|- Yeah, it's next to the dress store on Main.
I can swing that one.
What's the mission?
See if anyone's bought|supplies for a Hell Hound.
Gotcha.
Or see who's been|stocking up on Hell-Hound Snausages.
I hear those pups'll do|anything for a tasty treat.
Giles, you say this thing|eats brains.
Any brains?
- I suppose.
|- Then Tucker must be feeding it, right?
Yeah.
This kid orders cow brains|a couple of times a week.
It goes to this address.
Good luck.
That's a weird kid.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
What are you doin' here?
Hello to you, too.
Sorry, I'm just surprised.
Me, too.
I don't know why, though.
Where did I think|you get your blood, McPlasma's?
- How are you?
|- Right as rain.
Whatever that means.
Don't look at me like that.
I can lie to you|if I want to now.
We're "ex", remember?
- If it means anything, I miss you.
|- Can we not, please?
When I think about us, I have|this tendency to sort of go catatonic, and I really can't afford to do that right now.
I've got to stop a crazy|from pulling a Carrie at the prom.
- You're still plannin' to go?
|- Strictly in a chaperone capacity.
But it's fine.
I mean, I'm cool with going stag.
I'm over the whole "Buffy gets|one perfect high-school moment" thing.
But I'm not gonna let some subhuman|ruin it for the rest of the senior class.
- Let me help you.
|- I'm OK.
- If you ever need my help|- Look, I got it.
Thanks.
Hey.
Don't forget your dress.
|Aren't you wearing it tonight?
As much as I hate to admit it,|I haven't finished paying for it yet.
- Well, somebody did.
|- What?
Who?
- Zeroes all around, Buff.
|- Sorry.
Make not with the long faces.
|I got the address.
The prom starts soon.
You guys go on.
I will|catch up as soon as I put a lid on this jerk.
- What?
No way.
|- We can't just leave you, Buff.
- They're right.
You need|- To see taillights.
Hit the door.
I have everything under control.
- Buffy, it makes sense to|- Have a nice time.
- OK, then.
|- See ya.
I want you at the gym.
|Keep an eye on them till I get there.
I don't have to tell you|you're being rather rash.
Finding an address|hardly adds up to "case closed".
Look, it's done.
You wanna go after|them and tell them they can't go?
That all their planning|and dreaming was for nothing?
That they can't spend tonight|with their honeys, of all nights?
Angel's not taking you, is he?
Angel's leaving me.
He's leaving town.
Buffy, I'm sorry.
I don't really know what to say.
I understand that this sort of thing|requires ice cream of some kind.
Ice cream will come.
First, I wanna take out psycho boy.
- Are you sure?
|- The great thing about being a slayer?
Kicking ass is comfort food.
She wished her husband's head|would explode, which was great, except we were standing|three feet from him at the time.
What a mess.
Of course, during the plague,|it was always parts falling off.
Well, that got pretty old.
|The Renaissance, that was I must say, this is all rather odd to me.
Yes.
Being in an all-male preparatory,|we didn't go in for this sort of thing.
No, of course not.
|Unless you count the nights you made the lowerclassmen|get up as girls and watch them.
The dip is tasty, isn't it?
The salsa's hot.
Very hot.
We got in.
Maybe we should dance before|we get beseeched, bedevilled or beheaded.
- It's not gonna happen.
|- You're not even a little nervous?
We think Buffy's gonna let us down?
Wanna try some punch?
May I say you look smashing.
It's a start.
One time, a girl wished|that her ex would cannibalise himself.
Even I had a hard time watching that one.
Cordelia.
Wesley.
|My God in heaven, it's good to see you.
How are you both?
And details, please.
- Very well, thank you.
|- Yes, thank you.
- It looks good on you.
|- Well, duh!
- You ready to go?
|- Sorry.
New plan.
- The prom's a go, and you're pathetic.
|- Maybe.
Maybe not.
So that's how you brainwashed|the hounds to go psycho on prom?
- Neat, huh?
|- I don't get it.
What kind of sicko would destroy|the happiest night of a senior's life?
I have my reasons.
- Do you wanna go to the prom with me?
|- No.
Whatever.
Every maladjust has his reasons.
Luckily for me,|you're an incompetent maladjust.
Up.
OK.
Now, I'm gonna lock you in here,|and then I'm gonna party like it's 19 Gotta have a redundancy system.
|Any incompetent knows that.
My three fiercest babies are|on their way to the dance right now.
You think formalwear makes them crazy.
Wait till they see the mirror ball.
That's right.
Follow Buffy.
Good dogs.
Come on.
That song sucks.
Get back!
Bathroom?
You're welcome.
- Buffy, you look awesome.
|- So do you.
- Everything cool?
|- Coolest.
Devil dogs are history.
- How's the prom?
|- Strangely affecting.
I teared up when|they played "We Are Family".
Everything's perfect.
And the award for Sunnydale High's|Class Clown for 1999 goes to Jack Mayhew.
Please.
Anybody can be a prop class clown.
None of the people who vote|for these things are funny.
We have one more award to give out.
Is Buffy Summers here tonight?
Did she This is actually a new category.
It's the first time ever.
I guess there|were a lot of write-in ballots, and Well, the prom committee|asked me to read this.
"We're not good friends".
"Most of us never found|the time to get to know you, but that doesn't mean|we haven't noticed you".
"We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High|isn't really like other high schools".
"A lot of weird stuff happens here".
- Zombies!
|- Hyena people!
Snyder!
"But whenever there was a problem|or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it".
"Most of the people here|have been saved by you, or helped by you, at one time or another".
"We're proud to say that the class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any|graduating class in Sunnydale history".
"And we know at least|part of that is because of you".
"So the senior class offers its thanks|and gives you this".
It's from all of us, and it has written here: "Buffy Summers: Class Protector".
Mr Giles?
I'd like your opinion.
Now, the last thing I wish to do is model bad|behaviour in front of impressionable youth.
- I wonder if asking Miss Chase to dance|- For God's sake, man.
She's 18.
And you have the emotional maturity|of a blueberry scone.
Just have at it, would you,|and stop fluttering about Right then.
Thanks for that.
This isn't bad.
You did good work tonight, Buffy.
- And I got a little toy surprise.
|- Yes.
I had no idea that children|en masse could be gracious.
Every now and then people surprise you.
Every now and then.
I never thought you'd come.
It's a big night.
I didn't wanna miss it.
- It's just tonight.
It doesn't mean that I|- I know.
I mean, I understand.
Will you dance with me?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": - I'm Faith.
|- I'd say there was a new slayer in town.
She's unstable, Buffy.
Faith, no.
- You killed a man,|- I don't care, No one can stop the Ascension,|Mayor's got it wired, B, He built this town for demons to feed on.
|Come Graduation Day, he's gettin' paid.
- Open your present.
|- This is a thing of beauty, boss, No.
Faith?
I'm leaving - after the Ascension.
You don't wanna be with me?
I don't.
I can't believe you're breaking up with me.
OK.
Thanks a lot.
I can't believe this loser look.
|I lobbied so hard for the teal.
No one ever listens to me.
Lone fashionable wolf.
I like the maroon.
It has more dignity.
Dignity?
You?
In relation to clothes?
|I'm awash in a sea of confusion.
I just wanna look respectable in this.
|Considering I'm probably gonna die in it.
- Excuse me?
|- I'm telling ya.
I woke up the other day with|this feeling in my gut.
I just know: there is no way|I'm getting out of this school alive.
Wow.
You've really mastered|the power of positive giving up.
I've been lucky too many times.
|My number's comin' up.
And I was short.
One more rotation, and I'm shippin' stateside.
- You know what I mean?
|- Seldom, if ever.
Bye.
We'll keep in touch.
- Willow, will you sign my yearbook?
|- Yeah.
You have to sign mine, too.
You know, I really wish|we'd got to know each other better.
- Me, too.
|- I mean, you're so smart.
- I always wanted to be like that.
|- Thanks.
You're so sweet.
- I hope we don't lose touch.
|- No.
We'll hang out.
- Bye.
|- Bye.
- Oh, I'm gonna miss her.
|- Don't you hate her?
Yes, with a fiery vengeance.
|She picked on me for ten years.
The vacuous tramp.
It's like a sickness, Buffy.
|I'm just missing everything.
- I miss PE.
|- I think it's contagious.
The whole senior class|has turned into the sixties, or what I imagine|the sixties would have been like, without the war and the hairy armpits.
- You don't feel it?
|- No, I don't.
I mean, I guess I'll miss stuff, but|I just don't get the whole graduation thing.
You get a piece of paper,|and nothing changes.
I don't even think I'm gonna go.
Oh, trusty soda machine.
I push you for root beer, you give me Coke.
What do you mean, not go?
Why not?
Ascension.
Mayor becoming a demon,|snacking upon populace.
- I was planning on fighting him.
|- You can't do both?
Both what?
Go to graduation, and fight the Mayor.
The Mayor?
What, you guys didn't hear?
- Hear what?
|- Who our commencement speaker is.
- Siegfried?
|- No.
- Roy?
One of the tigers?
|- No.
Come out of the fantasy, Will.
I don't believe this.
Lends credence to my|"I'm gonna die" theorem, doesn't it?
Mayor at graduation.
|100 helpless kids to feed on.
You got any other surprises for us?
Just a moment.
- Hi.
I'm looking for Professor Worth.
|- That's me.
But I should ask you|to come back during office hours.
- Students generally|- I'm not from the college.
I work for Mayor Wilkins.
I'm Faith.
Well, come in.
Please.
I was so surprised when he called.
I didn't expect a politician|to be interested in my research.
- He's a big fan, Professor.
|- Lester's fine.
Are we alone here, Lester?
Well, yes.
Lifelong bachelor.
- I like my space.
|- I hear that.
You wanna turn and face the wall, Lester?
- What are you doing?
|- I'll make it quick.
Put that away.
- I'll scream.
|- Who wouldn't?
- Please.
|- Sorry, friend.
Boss wants you dead.
- Why?
|- You know, I never thought to ask.
And everything went|smoothly with Mr Worth?
Not if you're Mr Worth.
Well, that's swell.
You know how I feel about loose ends.
And the big day is so close,|you can smell the excitement in the air.
Say, are you ever coming out of there?
- I don't know.
|- Come on.
Wow.
Aren't you a vision!
I feel wicked stupid in this.
You look lovely.
Perfect for the Ascension.
Any boys that manage to survive|will be lining up to ask you out.
It just isn't me, though.
Not you?
Let me tell you something.
Nobody knows what you are.
Not even you, Little Miss Seen It All.
The Ascension isn't just my day.
It's yours, too.
Your day to blossom, show|the world what a powerful girl you are.
When I think of what you've done,|what I know you will do No father could be prouder.
- I hope I don't let you down.
|- Impossible.
Now, come on.
Change back into|your street clothes.
I'll buy you an icy.
- Hey, Rosenberg.
|- Hey, Percy.
Check it out.
History final.
- B minus.
That's great.
|- I'm a scholar.
I'm, like, a scholar.
- Congratulations.
|- Hey, listen.
Thank you.
I mean, for helping me.
Being so patient.
And also for not|kicking my ass like you did in the Bronze.
You know, Percy, that was|actually for your own good.
I know, I know.
- Hey.
|- Hey.
- History's important, you know.
|- No, I totally get that now.
And I got the grades,|and I'm graduating tomorrow.
I can forget all this crap.
Well, after graduation, he may not|have the chance to forget it all.
I'm just trying to keep things light.
But things aren't light.
I mean, it's|bad enough we have to fight the Mayor.
I don't want him|eating Percy and the whole class.
We have to find a spell or something|to stop the Ascension.
Then we will.
Thank you for joining us, Mr Harris.
Look, I realise you've all finished your finals|and you're ready to move on.
But you haven't graduated yet.
This is still a class,|and everyone will participate.
Mr Harris, would you care to begin?
- E,|- No.
There's no E, They always go for the E, - Next|- Hi.
- Steven.
|- Hey.
- L ?
|- So I was wondering Maybe if you're free this weekend,|maybe we could do some entertaining thing.
Would that be you telling me about|the men you destroyed in your demon days?
Cos pencil me in.
Well, we could do something else you like.
|We could watch sports of some kind.
- I don't know.
|- Men like sports.
I'm sure of it.
Yes.
Men like sports.
Men watch the action movie.
They eat of|the beef, and enjoy to look at the bosoms.
A thousand years,|and that's all you've learned?
Hey, I'm trying, OK?
|You don't need to take my head off.
I'm sorry.
Look I don't even know if|I'm gonna make it to next weekend.
Tell you what, I survive the Ascension, then maybe you and I|could do some sports-related What?
- Faith.
|- You're sure?
It's one of her pieces.
|I recognise the brushwork.
"Brutally stabbed.
Lester Worth,|visiting professor of geology".
There's nothing in here|that bellows "motive".
Random killing, perhaps?
Fit of rage?
Everybody does seem to be going a bit mad,|and Faith has something of a head start.
Doesn't read.
I think it's homework.
- The Mayor wanted him out of the way.
|- Which leads to the question "How come"?
I'm gonna destroy the entire city,|but I kill harmless Lester first?
Tying up loose ends?
|Lester had something, or knew something.
And I wanna know too.
The Mayor's|trying to hide.
I say we go seek.
By attempting to keep|a valuable clue from us, the Mayor may have|inadvertently led us right to it.
What page are you on, Wes?
|Cos we already got there.
Yes.
Well You will go tonight, look over his apartment.
|Anything of note, report back here.
I just love it|when you take charge, you man, you.
That Was that a yes?
- I'm having trouble keeping track.
|- I'll go.
Be careful.
If Faith should show up I don't think she'll show.
Been there,|killed that.
She's not much for follow-up.
Nonetheless, keep watch.
|Faith has you at a disadvantage, Buffy.
Cos I'm not crazy, or cos I don't kill people?
Both, actually.
I hear you.
I can't kill her,|fun as it may sound.
I can make her cry uncle, though,|and I mean to.
Don't let your feelings about Faith|interfere with your work.
Stopping Faith is my work.
|Take a beat to love this energy.
Faith is a footnote.
Our priority|is stopping the Ascension.
Easier said than done, Monarchy Boy.
If you don't have|something constructive to add You guys wanna know about the Ascension?
Well, meet the only living person|who's ever been to one.
About 800 years ago|in the valleys above the Urals, there was a sorcerer there|who achieved Ascension.
He became the embodiment|of the demon Lohesh.
I was there cursing a shepherd|who'd been unfaithful.
- His wife had wished that all his sheep|- Could we cut back to the chase?
Sorry.
Lohesh was It it decimated the village within hours.
Maybe three people got out.
I've seen some horrible things.
I've been the|cause of most of them, actually, but this I'm sorry.
Lohesh was|a four-winged soul killer.
Am I right?
I was given to understand|that they're not that fierce.
- Of all the demons we've faced|- You've never seen a demon.
Excuse me.
Killing them|professionally four years running.
All the demons that walk the Earth are|tainted, are human hybrids like vampires.
The Ascension means that a human|becomes pure demon.
They're different.
- Different?
|- How?
Well, for one thing, they're bigger.
The kids are here,|the parents off to the side there.
We'll go up, they'll play the processional,|and then you'll give the address.
- It all looks wonderful.
|- As long as nobody makes any trouble.
Stop worrying.
|Just make sure the kids show up.
Anybody who doesn't feel like coming,|they'll just have to live without a diploma.
- They'll be here, sir.
|- Call me Richard.
You've done a great job here.
I know things are, well,|different here in Sunnydale.
We've seen all sorts of things.
What's|important is that we keep it under control.
- And that's what you've done.
|- I believe in order.
Sunnydale owes you a debt.
It will be repaid.
Yes, sir.
We'll mark that invoice "Paid in full".
It doesn't sound like Lohesh.
|The rituals are all different.
- I wish that was a relief.
|- What's goin' on?
How come Evil Girl's in the mix?
Anya witnessed an Ascension.
OK, then.
What about the spiders?
The Mayor|had a box of spiders that he had to eat.
Or the box of I wanna say "gravlax"?
- Gavrok.
|- It doesn't ring a bell.
Well, there must be something|that would be helpful.
So This is the inner sanctum.
Faith tells me this is where you folks like|to hang out, concoct your little schemes.
It's just nice to see that some young people|are still interested in reading in this modern era.
So, what are kids reading nowadays?
"The beast will walk upon the earth,|and darkness will follow".
"The several races of man will be|as one in their terror and destruction".
That's kinda sweet.
|Different races coming together.
You never get even a little tired|of hearing yourself speak, do you?
That's one spunky little girl you've raised.
I'm gonna eat her.
Whoa.
Well, now, that was a little thoughtless.
Violent outbursts like that?
|In front of the children?
You know, Mr Giles,|they look to you to see how to behave.
Get out.
I smell fear.
That's smart.
But some of your deaths will be quick,|if that's worth anything.
Well See you all at graduation.
You don't wanna miss|my commencement address.
It's gonna be one heck of a speech.
Anya, wait.
Where are you goin'?
Anywhere.
If there's a lunar shuttle|going up anytime soon, I'm on it.
We need you here.
You might be able to help.
Or I might be able to live.
You can't stop the Ascension, Xander.
|You were right the first time.
The only thing|any sane person can do now is run.
- What's her saga?
|- She's freakin'.
- About what?
|- The Mayor is gonna kill us all.
- Are you gonna go to fifth period?
|- I might skip it.
Yeah.
Me, too.
Buffy, I'm home.
Do you wanna go to a What are you doing?
You're running away again?
- And you're taking my clothes.
|- Mom, I need you to leave town.
Tonight.
- Buffy, I'd miss your graduation.
|- Yeah, that's sort of the idea.
- I wouldn't dream of it.
|- Graduation is a pointless ceremony where you sit around till someone hands|you a piece of paper that says you graduated.
And maroon does nothing|for my complexion, so don't argue, OK?
What, is some terrible demon|going to attack the school?
I see.
You know, Buffy, looking back|at everything that's happened - I should have sent you to a different school.
|- Just promise me you'll be far away.
I am not leaving you to face|an awful monster.
If I go, you go with me.
- You know that I can't.
|- Well, then, I can't either.
- I know sometimes you wish I were different.
|- Buffy, no.
I wished I could be a lot of things for you.
A great student,|a star athlete, remotely normal.
I'm not.
But there is something I do better|than anybody else in the world.
I'm gonna fight this thing.
|But I can't do it and worry about you.
- Buffy, I just can't|- You stay, you'll get me killed.
You have to trust me on this.
Can you do that?
This is so frustrating.
- Nothin' useful?
|- No, it's great.
If we want to make farms invisible|or communicate with shrimp, I've got the goods right here.
Our lives are different than other people's.
Who am I kidding?
I'm not gonna|find a spell to stop the Ascension.
I'm no witch.
I can't even|change poor Amy back to a person.
But you got the swinging Habitrail goin'.
|I think Amy's in a good place emotionally.
- Oz.
|- What?
Could you just pretend to care|about what's happening, please?
- You think I don't care?
|- I think we could be dead in two days' time, and you're being ironic detachment guy.
- Would it help if I panic?
|- Yes.
It'd be swell.
Panic is a thing people can|share in times of crisis, and everything's really scary now,|and I don't know what's gonna happen.
And there's things you're supposed|to get to do after high school, and I was looking forward to doing them,|and we're probably just gonna die.
And I'd like to feel that maybe you would - What are you doin'?
|- Panicking.
Stealthy!
Not my best entrance.
|I think they were moppin' in the halls.
What are you doing here?
I checked in with Giles.
|He asked me to back you up.
- He's afraid I'll run into Faith.
|- And you're not?
It's gonna happen sooner or later.
What's that?
A report.
Excavation of some old lava bed.
The guy was a volcano-ologist or something.
Anything that connects him to the Mayor?
I looked through it,|but all I understood were the commas.
I'll bring it to Giles,|see if he can do better.
Let me give you a hand.
Thank you, but I can take it from here.
- It's all right.
I'll walk you there.
|- Look, I don't need an escort.
I'm a big girl, with superpowers, remember?
I don't need you crowding me.
- I didn't think I was.
|- No, of course you don't.
You just show up at the prom|and then you disappear into the ozone.
For all I know, you left town.
Are you mad at me for being|around too much, or not enough?
- Duh!
Yes.
|- Which?
- What?
|- I don't get you.
No, you don't.
Not any more.
Are you just making this harder|to make this easier on yourself?
Could we stop with the brain-teasers?
- I just wish it was over.
Done.
|- It's not that simple.
Once the Mayor I know.
World in peril|and we have to work together.
This is my last office romance,|I'll tell you that.
- You want me out of your face?
|- Isn't it even a little hard for you?
How can you ask me that?
|Just cos I'm not acting like a brat - It's nice to know what you think of me.
|- What do you expect me to say?
I can't do this any more.
I can't have you in my life|when I'm trying to move on.
Angel.
Missed the heart.
Meant to.
- There.
|- OK, ready?
- Yeah.
|- On three.
- One|- I knew you were gonna do that.
- Not too much blood here.
|- I heal fast.
I should be all right.
- I'm just glad Faith's such a suck shot.
|- Are we sure it was her?
Well, I've narrowed down|my list of one suspect.
- Fascinating.
|- What?
It seems our Mr Worth|headed an expedition in Kauai, digging through old lava beds|near a dormant volcano.
- I'm not fascinated yet.
|- He found something underneath.
A carcass, buried by an eruption.
- A carcass?
|- A very large one.
Mr Worth posits that it might be|some heretofore undiscovered dinosaur.
- A demon?
|- The Mayor would want to keep that secret.
If it's the same kind of demon he's|turning into and it's dead, it means he's only impervious|to harm until the Ascension.
In this demon form, he could be killed.
Great.
So all we need is a million tons|of burning lava.
We're saved.
Well, it's a start, anyway.
OK, you have been a real klutz today.
|You need to Damn.
- We'll have to run some tests.
|- My shoulder's numb.
- You're burning up.
|- It's poison.
I can feel it.
Call the others.
Get them here.
We need to move him to the safety|of his own bed before the sun comes up.
- Will you be able to find out what this is?
|- The Council has all known toxins on file.
- I'll contact them immediately.
|- Thanks.
You're gonna be OK.
I feel different.
You know?
I guess that makes sense.
|Do you feel different?
Oh, no, you've already Probably no big change for you.
It it was nice.
Was it nice?
Should this be a quiet moment?
I know exactly what you mean.
Which part?
Everything feels different.
Hello?
We gotta go.
- He's dropped, boss.
|- Applause, applause.
Right in the back.
He pitches over and|Buffy's freakin', looking around all panicked.
That should keep her occupied for a spell.
- What next?
|- The ritual of Gavrok.
I have to ingest|several of the inhabitants of this box.
- Ingest?
|- Eat.
- You're wicked gross.
|- Well, you don't have to watch.
Just go home, take it easy.
|It's a big day tomorrow.
You gotta give me something to do.
|Don't you need anyone dead?
Or maimed?
- I can settle for maimed.
|- You little firecracker.
My mom used to call me that.
When I was little.
|I was always runnin' around Tomorrow.
The Ascension and all that.
|Am I gonna get to fight?
If everything goes smoothly,|you won't have to.
- But how often do things go smoothly?
|- So you'll still need me in there.
Always.
When I was a kid, a couple of miles|outside of Boston there was this quarry.
All the kids used to swim there|and jump off the rocks.
And there was this one rock, like, 40 feet up.
I was the only one that would jump off it.
|All the older kids were too scared.
Not you, though.
No.
I could do it easy.
Get some rest.
Good luck with your spiders there.
They should have this at the magic shop.
I can run a trace analysis,|see if it's a mystical poison.
- I'm a little short on cash.
|- Just tell 'em it's for me.
Right.
Xander?
What are you doin' here?
|I thought you'd be in Aruba by now.
Hey, I'm packed.
My car's right outside.
I just I I had to What?
You could come with me.
Come with you?
You mean that?
Why not?
We could just|get in the car and drive and No one would miss us.
|We could take turns driving, keep each other awake.
You're going to die if you stay here.
I guess I might.
When I think that something could happen to|you, it feels bad inside.
Like I might vomit.
- Welcome to the world of romance.
|- It's horrible.
No wonder I used to get so much work.
Well, I'm sorry I give you barfy feelings.
Come with me.
- I can't.
|- Why not?
- I got friends on the line.
|- So?
That humanity thing's|a work in progress, isn't it?
Are you really gonna be that much help to|them?
You'll probably just get in the way.
- Your stock's plummetin' here, sweetheart.
|- Fine.
You know what?
I hope you die.
Aren't we gonna kiss?
It'll be OK.
You'll be OK.
Did you reach the Council?
Yes.
They They couldn't help.
Couldn't?
Wouldn't.
It's not Council policy|to cure vampires.
- Under special circum|- Not under any circumstances.
- I did try to convince them.
|- Try again.
They're very firm.
We're talking about laws|which have existed longer than civilisation.
I'm talking about watching my lover die.
I don't have a clue what you're|talking about, and I don't care.
Buffy, we'll find a cure.
- The Council's orders are to concentrate|- Orders?
I don't think I'm gonna|be taking any more orders.
Not from you, not from them.
You can't turn your back on the Council.
They're in England.
I don't think|they can tell which way my back is facing.
Giles, talk to her.
I have nothing to say right now.
Go back to your Council and tell them|until the next slayer comes along, they can close up shop.
I'm not working for them any more.
Don't you see what's happening?
Faith poisoned Angel to distract you,|to keep you out of the Mayor's way.
And it's working.
We need a strategy, I have a strategy.
You're not in it.
This is mutiny.
I like to think of it as graduation.
I can't stay here.
|I'll go see if I can help the others.
- Of course.
|- You'll watch him?
I'll call if there's any change.
Buffy You don't know what you're doing.
Get a job.
Finding the poison wasn't that hard.
|It's a mystical compound.
The Latin name translates roughly to|"Killer of the Dead".
Used on vampires.
And the cure?
There aren't a lot of instances|of it being cured.
- But there are some.
|- One or two.
Pretty vague accounts.
How is he?
- Hold it.
|- You got somethin'?
- I'm not sure.
|- Be sure.
OK.
"Killer of the Dead".
That's our boy,|and here's a vamp that walked away from it.
Does it talk about the cure?
Damn.
- Nothing?
|- No, it's in here, but Wait.
"Completely reversed the effects".
What?
Come on, guys.
|The suspense is killing Angel.
The only way to cure this thing|is to drain the blood of a slayer.
- Good.
|- Good?
What did I miss?
No, it's perfect.
Angel needs to|drain a slayer, then I'll bring him one.
Buffy, if Angel drains Faith's blood,|it'll kill her.
Not if she's already dead.
A leasing agreement, not in her name.
If the|Mayor's putting her up, it might be in his.
- Maybe he's charging it to the city.
|- Cross-reference realty with municipal funds.
- You wanna drive?
|- Sorry.
Someone should take over|for Giles after a while, watch Angel.
I don't mean to play devil's advocate,|but are you up to this?
It's time.
We're talking to the death.
I can't play kid games any more.
|This is how she wants it.
- I just don't wanna lose you.
|- I won't get hurt.
That's not what I mean.
Just get me an address.
I got it.
Thought I'd stop by.
- Is he dead yet?
|- He's not gonna die.
It was a good try, though.
Your plan?
The Mayor got me the poison.
|He said it was wicked painful.
- There's a cure.
|- Damn.
What is it?
Your blood.
As justice goes,|it's not unpoetic, don't you think?
Come to get me?
|You're gonna feed me to Angel?
- You know you're not gonna take me alive.
|- Not a problem.
Well, look at you.
|All dressed up in big sister's clothes.
You told me I was just like you.
That I was holding it in.
Ready to cut loose?
- Try me.
|- OK, then.
Give us a kiss.
You're not getting tired, are you?
|I'm just starting to feel it.
Stick around.
Buffy Right.
Right.
- Something about the demon?
|- Villagers near the volcano make reference to the legend of Olukai.
It might be a bastardisation of "Olvikan".
- Who's Olvikan?
|- I know it's a demon.
I might have a picture.
It's a good thing no one ever wanted|to check these books out, huh?
- Yes, it's very convenient.
|- Come on, Olvikan.
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
My God, what a feeling.
The power of these creatures.
It suffuses my being.
I can feel the changes begin.
My organs are shifting, merging,|making ready for the Ascension.
Plus these babies are high in fibre.
And|why become a demon if you're not regular?
Am I right?
We don't knock during dark rituals?
Sir, there may be trouble.
At Faith's.
What's the matter?
All that killing|and you're afraid to die?
- That's mine.
|- Well, you're about to get it back.
Man, I'm gonna miss this.
You did it.
You killed me.
Still won't help your boy, though.
You shoulda been there, B. Quite a ride.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- What are you doin'?
|- Panicking.
Previously on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer": See you all at graduation.
I want my life to be with you.
- I don't.
|- I can't believe you're breaking up with me.
Angel.
It's poison.
I can feel it.
The only way to cure this thing|is to drain the blood of a slayer.
Angel needs to drain a slayer,|then I'll bring him one.
You killed me.
There's nobody here, sir.
No.
No, she'd take the fight outside.
My Faith doesn't like to be cooped up.
We have to find them.
|Put everyone on it.
Do it now.
- But, sir, the Ascension.
|- Find them!
Faith's a good girl.
She can take anything they'll throw at her.
She's gonna be all right.
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right.
- Any word from Buffy?
|- Not yet.
Your coffee, brewed from|the finest Colombian lighter fluid.
Thank you.
Horrible.
- Aren't you supposed to be drinking tea?
|- Tea is soothing.
I wish to be tense.
OK.
But you're destroying|a perfectly good cultural stereotype here.
Look through the Kippler volumes.
Any reference to the demon Olvikan -|powers, weaknesses, hat size.
- There's got to be something.
|- Still battin' zero?
But I mean in cricket?
- Cordy, what's up?
|- I demand an explanation.
- For what?
|- Wesley.
Inbreeding?
So very funny.
Any minute I'm sure to laugh.
He just called.
He could hardly speak,|he was so upset.
He said there was something about a fight.
|And he's leaving the county.
Should I assay remorse?
Just tell me what's going on.
Buffy's quit the Council.
She'll not be working|with Wesley from now on.
- But he's her watcher.
|- Buffy no longer needs a watcher.
Well, does he have to leave the county?
You got fired and you still hang around|like a big loser.
Why can't he?
Cordelia, we're trying|to stop a massacre here.
Wanna give us a hand?
Sure.
It's just such a Buffy thing to do.
She's always thinking of herself.
You're awake.
You've been watching over me?
Well, we've been takin' turns.
I thought I thought I'd never see you again.
I can't leave you.
I was wrong.
I need you.
You mean you need Buffy.
- Willow?
|- Yes!
Right!
Willow.
- Where is she?
|- She'll be back soon.
Any change?
- He's delirious.
He thought I was Buffy.
|- You too, huh?
I hope she gets here soon.
She'd better.
Yeah.
I feel so I feel so guilty.
Guilty?
Well, things are so terrible and|everything's coming apart, and I'm just In some ways,|this is the best night of my life.
The best.
I just checked on him just now.
|We were watching.
Did you find Faith?
You didn't She's not here?
How is he?
He comes in and out.
I think the pain is less now.
Would you guys I'd like to be alone with him.
Of course.
We'll try to find another cure.
Thanks.
Buffy.
It's you?
It's me.
I didn't wanna go without seeing you.
- Angel, I can cure you.
|- It's OK.
- I'm ready.
|- Angel, listen to me.
Sit up.
You're gonna live.
You have to live.
- What way?
|- Drink.
Drink me.
- No.
|- It's the only way.
- Get away.
|- It'll save you.
- It'll kill you.
|- Maybe not.
Not if you don't take it all.
You can't ask me to do this.
I won't let you die.
I can't.
Angel, the blood of a slayer is the only cure.
Faith.
I tried.
I killed her.
Then it's over.
It is never over.
I won't let you die.
Drink.
Please.
Buffy?
I need some help!
She's lost a lot of blood.
- What happened?
|- She needs blood.
- Stay calm.
|- Something bit her.
She needs a transfusion.
- You found her?
Was she conscious?
|- Yes.
- Are you sure?
|- Sure.
I need a type.
Get her on two lines of Ringer's|lactate and watch for hypovolemic shock.
- What happened?
|- Something bit her.
I don't know what.
- OK.
I need a rabies shot.
Any allergies?
|- No.
Just Just help her.
You two been doing drugs?
You want her to live,|you have to be straight with me.
She's clean.
All right.
Wait outside.
Let us work.
A phone?
Right out there.
The bones are set and the damage|to the kidneys is repairable.
But the head trauma.
It's Well, it's simply too severe.
You know, it's a wonder|she's alive at all with the blood loss.
I'm sorry, sir, but there's almost no chance|that she's ever gonna regain consciousness.
It's your day.
We have another young girl with blood loss.
|Dr Powell wants you to assist on a cutdown.
I'll be right there.
Oh, my God.
Sir, no!
Somebody call Security!
Don't do that.
I will.
I'll do that and worse.
- Murderous fiend.
See what she did to Faith?
|- Hadn't made plans to weep over that one.
I'd get set for some weeping, if I were you.
|I'd get set for a world of pain.
Misery loves company.
I wanna|share that with you and your whore.
Well, looks like somebody's|been eating his spinach.
That's OK, folks.
It's all right.
The show is not over,|but there will be a short intermission.
Don't wanna miss the second act.
All kinds of excitement.
I'll be there.
- How is she?
|- She's fine.
- She's asleep.
|- You seem all right, too.
Yeah.
- What happened?
|- She was fine.
Did Faith?
Faith's out of the picture.
|Buffy put her in a coma.
And?
Buffy cured me.
Made me You fed off her?
Yes.
- How much?
|- She's gonna be fine.
She won't be a vampire?
No.
She didn't feed off me.
It's good to know that when things look grim, you'll feed off the girl who loves you|to save your own ass.
You'd better go.
We'll watch over her.
- I don't want to|- The sun'll be up soon.
- I'm gonna miss him when he leaves town.
|- Let's find out how Buffy's doing.
Who's gonna look after him?
It's a she.
And aren't these things|supposed to take care of themselves?
A higher power guiding us?
I'm pretty sure that's not what I meant.
There's something I'm supposed to be doing.
Oh, yeah.
Miles to go.
Little Miss Muffet counting down from 130.
Great.
Riddles.
Sorry.
It's my head.
A lot of new stuff.
They're never gonna fix this, are they?
What about you?
Scar tissue.
It fades.
It all fades.
You want another deal?
Human weakness.
It never goes away.
Even his.
Is this your mind or mine?
Beats me.
Gettin' towards that time.
- How are you gonna fit all this stuff?
|- Not gonna.
- It's yours.
|- I can't use all of this.
Just take what you need.
You ready?
Buffy.
- Are you OK?
|- How do you feel?
- Is Angel here?
|- He had to go.
It got kinda sunny.
- Get him.
Get everyone.
|- What exactly is up?
- Buffy, you sure you're all right?
|- I'm ready.
Ready for what?
War.
That's the basic plan.
So, am I crazy?
- Well, crazy is such a strong word.
|- Let's not rule it out, though.
- You don't think it can be done?
|- I didn't say that.
I might, but not yet.
I don't think it's possible|to come up with a crazier plan.
We attack the Mayor with hummus.
- I stand corrected.
|- Just keeping things in perspective.
Thank you.
My point, however, is, crazy or not,|it's pretty much the only plan.
Besides, it's Buffy's.
And she's slay gal.
|You know, Little Miss Likes To Fight.
So I think there was a yea vote|buried in there somewhere.
I'm gonna need every|single one of you on board.
Especially you, Xander.
|You're sort of the key figure here.
Key?
Me?
OK, pride, humility.
And here's the mind-numbing fear.
|What do I have to do?
Remember any training|from when you became soldier guy?
- Rocket launcher?
|- Rocket launcher not gonna do it.
It took a volcano to kill|one of these things last time.
Buffy All this is rather dependent|on your being able to control the Mayor.
Faith told me to play on his human weakness.
Faith told you?
Was that|before or after you put her in a coma?
After.
- His weakness?
|- Right.
Which is?
You know, I do all this planning, I'm in charge|here even though I'm really not at my best Well, let's Let's think.
Angel, you hung with him the most.
|Was there something he's afraid of?
Well, he's not crazy about germs.
Of course, that's it.
|We'll attack him with germs.
Great.
We'll corner him and sneeze on him.
No.
No, we'll get a container|of Ebola virus and Or it doesn't even have to be real.
|We can just get a box that says "Ebola" on it and chase him.
- With the box.
|- I'm leaning towards the hummus offensive.
- He'll never see it comin'.
|- Faith.
- Faith?
|- At the hospital he was grieving.
Seriously crazed, and not just in|a homicidal, "I wanna be a demon" way.
- She's his weak link.
|- Faith.
- I can work that.
|- You haven't an enormous amount of time.
Hey, it's Mr States The Obvious.
The Council is not welcome here.
|I have no time for orders.
If I need someone|to scream like a woman, I'll call.
I'm not here for the Council.
Just tell me how I can help.
That is so classy.
Isn't he just so classy?
It's a start.
So there is something I can do|besides scream like a woman.
There's plenty.
There's chores for everyone.
- OK, this is how|- ..
it's gonna lay out.
The transformation should begin at|exactly 3:28.
I'll just be finishing my speech.
You know, it's too bad you fellas are gonna|miss that cos it speaks to every one of us.
Heck, I've been working on it|for a hundred years.
Better be good.
They'll try to run, of course, and that's|when I need you boys in flanking position.
- But, sir, the sun.
|- Not a problem.
"Darkness will follow.
|The day becomes night".
- An eclipse.
|- Standard procedure for an ascension.
- That puts me back in the game.
|- Yeah, it does.
You and Xander are gonna|have to work together now, OK?
- I'm still key guy, right?
|- Right.
Great.
Then Angel, in his|non-key-guy capacity, can work with me.
- What fun.
|- Key guy still talking.
Oh, good, start bickering.
That's gonna work|great for us.
You guys are like little old ladies.
You'll come up through the sewers here.
|The important thing is containment.
I'll need to feed.
It's crucial in the first|few minutes to sustain the change.
What does that mean?
No snacking.
I see blood on your lips,|it's a visit to the woodshed for you boys.
Kill.
Don't feed.
- How are we on volcano detail?
|- We can work it out.
- Fun with Chemistry,|- Xander said he can get the materials.
- Who's gonna stoke it up?
|- You feel up to it?
I suppose it should be I.|Strangely fitting in a grotesque fashion.
OK, guys, start reaching out.
|Giles, weapons, weapons, weapons.
- What about you?
|- There's something I need to get.
Remember: fast and brutal.
It's gonna be a new world come nightfall.
|Don't wanna weaken now.
And, boys, let's watch the swearing.
- Harmony, I need to talk to you for a sec.
|- You mean in front of other people?
- Are they serious?
I'm gonna look stupid.
|- Percy.
- Do I look stupid in this?
Be honest.
|- You look great.
You got a sec?
- Cordelia.
|- Yes.
- You know that when this is over|- Yes?
Well, should we prevail, I'll be going back to England.
I know.
With Buffy no longer working for the Council, there's really no place for me here.
I guess not.
No reason to stay.
- No.
|- No.
No cause to hope that - I might be needed.
|- Needed.
- Or wanted.
|- Wanted.
- Good luck in England.
|- Thank you.
I'll drop you a line sometime.
That'd be neat.
Put these with the others.
|Don't touch anything.
- What do we do then?
|- Nothing.
Just relax.
Have a good time.
OK.
OK, it's clear.
Let's move.
I guess that's it.
Won't be long now.
- You nervous?
|- Only in a terrified way.
- We're gonna make it through this.
|- Are you sure?
- I sound pretty sure, don't I?
|- Yeah.
Then I must be sure.
Is that just a comforting way|of not answering the question?
How long till graduation?
A little while.
- Did you get what you needed?
|- Yeah, I did.
- This isn't gonna be enough.
|- Giles is on it.
How are you?
I heal fast.
Like you.
- So, are we sure everyone's good|- I'm not gonna say goodbye.
When we get through this, I'm just gonna go.
You can understand?
There's just too much to Congratulations to the class of 1999.
|You all proved more or less adequate.
This is a time of celebration,|so sit still and be quiet.
Spit out that gum.
Please welcome our distinguished|guest speaker, Richard Wilkins III.
I saw that gesture.
|You see me after graduation.
Am I late?
Shall we fight?
Well!
What a day this is.
Special day.
Today is our centennial.
The 100th|anniversary of the founding of Sunnydale.
And I know what that means to all you kids.
Not a darn thing.
Cos today something|much more important happens.
Today you all graduate from high school.
Today all the pain, all the work,|all the excitement is finally over.
What's 100 years of history compared to that?
My God.
He's gonna do the entire speech.
Man, just ascend already.
Evil.
..
whether you like it or not.
It's been a long road getting here|for you, for Sunnydale.
There's been achievement, joy, good times.
And there's been grief.
There's been loss.
Some people who|should be here today aren't.
But we are.
Journey's end.
And what is a journey?
|Is it just distance travelled?
Time spent?
No.
It's what happens on the way.
|It's the things that shape you.
At the end of the journey you're not the same.
|Today is about change.
Graduation doesn't just mean your|circumstances change.
It means you do.
You ascend, to a higher level.
Nothing will ever be the same.
Nothing.
And so, as we look back on on the events that have|brought us to this day Come on.
..
we we must all It has begun.
My destiny.
It's a little sooner than I expected.
|I had this whole section on civic pride.
But I guess we'll just skip to the big finish.
Now!
Flame units!
First wave!
Fire!
Go!
Go!
Go!
This is simply unacceptable.
- Xander?
|- Bowmen!
Fire!
- Fall back!
|- Fire!
This is not orderly.
This is not disciplined.
You're on my campus, buddy.
|When I say I want quiet, I mean Fall back!
Get back!
- Go.
|- Good luck.
- Xander, take him down!
|- Everyone, hand-to-hand!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Move!
Move!
Get the kids!
Right flank, close in!
Close!
Justin, Doug,|you guys are the right flank.
Get some help here.
You remember this?
I took it from Faith.
Stuck it in her gut.
Just slid in her like she was butter.
You wanna get it back from me, Dick?
Well, gosh.
If I could just get something for the pain?
|It's rather a lot of pain, actually.
Aspirin, anyone?
Perhaps I could just|be knocked unconscious.
- Got off pretty cheap considering.
|- It seems like we did.
He made it through the fight.
I guess maybe he he took off after.
- You all right?
|- I'm tired.
I should imagine so.
|It's quite a couple of days.
I haven't processed everything yet.
My brain|isn't really functioning on the higher levels.
