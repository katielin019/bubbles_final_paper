{START OF EPISODE 1}
Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her parents, and I don't know what happened.
I'm your mother.
Monica joked she wouldn't date Chandler.
I don't know what happened there either.
Ross' new girlfriend shows up.
Rachel gets Bonnie to shave her head.
Then they kiss.
Now he has to choose Rachel or the bald girl.
I don't know what happened there either.
Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.
She's helping me.
My head's sunburned.
-Thanks a million.
-You're welcome a million.
Smell it.
Minty.
I'll be in our room.
Oh, my God!
I know.
I got to go.
I got to go break up with Bonnie.
Here?
Now?
I can't stay here all night.
If I go in there, she'll want to do stuff.
Can't you say you aren't in the mood?
No, she likes that.
Faking sleep doesn't work.
I've woken up many times with her -Why am I telling you?
-I don't know.
-Not every morning -Making it worse!
The One with the Jellyfish You probably want to know how it happened.
I think I can figure it out.
I was born, and then everyone lied their asses off.
No, it wasn't like that.
Remember how I said Lilly, Frank and I were close?
We were very close.
How close?
The three of us were kind of a couple.
I don't know how that would work.
I'm not asking!
Anyhow, somehow I got pregnant and I was scared.
I was stupid and selfish.
I was 18 years old.
Remember what it was like to be 18?
Mom killed herself and my dad ran off.
I lived in a Gremlin with a guy who talked to his hand.
I'm sorry.
I thought I'd left you with the best parents.
I didn't hear about them till a few years ago.
By then, you were already grown-up.
You're here and I would really like to get to know you.
Well, everybody does.
I'm a really cool person.
You had 29 years to find out, but you didn't even try.
You walked out on me, and I'll do the same.
I don't ever want to see you again.
Where's my purse?
Shoot!
We're out of soda.
-I'll get you some.
-Really?
No, because I'm not your boyfriend.
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?
My mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth mom.
I found a dried-up seahorse.
What do you mean?
My new mom, who's a big fat abandoner.
Don't you want to stay here and talk about it?
I need to be alone.
Man.
Hey what if you found out that your mom wasn't really your mom and your new mom turned out to be really hot?
Oh, man, huh?
But, it's your mom.
No, I'm talking about your mom.
It's over.
Was it awful?
It was long.
I didn't realize how late it was till I saw the five o'clock shadow on her head.
She didn't want to stay.
I called a cab.
She just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh, thank you!
I like mail.
It's just some things I've been thinking about.
About us.
Before we even think about us getting back together I need to know how you feel about this stuff.
It's 5:30 in the morning.
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.
I'll be waiting for you.
Come up when you're done.
I'll be up in 18 pages.
Front and back.
Very exciting!
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?
Done.
-You just finished?
-I wanted to be thorough.
This is clearly very important to you.
To us.
I wanted to read every word carefully.
Twice.
Does it?
I'm sorry?
Does it?
Does it?
Does it?
I wanted to give that whole "Does it"?
part another glance.
What do you mean?
You said you read it twice.
It either does or doesn't.
If you have to think No, I don't have to think about it.
In fact I've decided.
I have decided that it does.
-Are you sure?
-Sure, I'm sure!
There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.
Would you go out with me?
I've got canned goods.
Take a look at this!
Check this baby out!
Dug me a hole.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh, no!
My hole!
My foot!
What is it?
Jellyfish sting!
It hurts!
Can we help you to the house?
It's two miles.
And I'm tired from digging.
Damn the jellyfish!
Damn all the jellyfish!
Do something.
There's only one thing.
What is it?
Pee on it.
Gross!
I saw it on Discovery Channel.
He's right.
There's ammonia in that that kills the pain.
Forget it.
It doesn't hurt that bad!
You can use my hole for privacy.
I'm ready to get the hell out of here.
Are you?
That's so great!
Not for Bonnie.
But for you, yea!
-How was the beach?
-Nothing.
I don't know.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
-I'm going to shower.
-Me too.
Me too.
I'll put this in the car.
I have to go pack!
-And it really does?
-lt does.
It really and truly does.
It so does not!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.
She goes on for five pages about how I was unfaithful to her.
We were on a break!
If you say that one more time, I'll break up with you.
This breakup was not all my fault.
She says here "lf you accept full responsibility I can begin to trust you again.
Does that seem like something you can do?
Does it"?
You have what you want.
You're back with her.
If you bring this up now, you'll wreck it.
Yeah, I know.
You're right.
I'll let it go.
But you know how hard it is to forget this?
Sure, it's hard but you don't have to talk about it.
A lot happened on that trip that we should never, ever talk about.
What happened on that beach?
It's between us and the sea, Ross.
Hi, Ursula.
I know that we haven't talked in a long time.
Our mom is not our birth mom.
This other lady is our birth mom.
Right, the one that lives in Montauk.
You know her?
No.
I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
There was a suicide note?
Do you still have it?
Hang on.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.
Yeah, so how have you been doing?
Shut up!
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk".
You just wrote this!
It's pretty much the gist.
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?
All right.
Hang on.
Pass the cheese, please.
You can't even look at me, can you?
It's Phoebe!
We can talk to Phoebe!
I'm too depressed to talk.
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.
What about making that beach trip an annual thing?
What happened out there?
What?
We took a walk.
Nothing happened.
I came back with nothing all over me.
What happened?
Joey?
All right.
We swore we'd never tell.
They'll never understand.
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive!
-Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
-All right!
I got stung.
Stung bad.
I couldn't stand.
I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house.
We were scared and alone.
We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging.
Then Joey remembered something.
I'd seen it on Discovery Channel.
Wait, I saw that.
On the Discovery Channel.
About jellyfish and how if you You peed on yourself?
You can't say that!
You don't know!
I thought I would pass out.
I tried, but I couldn't bend that way.
That's right.
I stepped up.
She's my friend and she needed help.
If I had to, I'd pee on any of you.
Only I couldn't.
I got the stage fright.
I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.
So I turned to Chandler.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now.
Do it.
Do it now"!
Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming.
Because I do it through my wall to freak you out.
Maybe there's somebody you guys could talk to.
Oh, who?
It's not like they have a group for people like us.
Yeah, no, there's this guy Owen, he's the best.
Might have his card.
And fuchsia and mauve Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom I invite all of you to count the colors in your bedroom.
Except for you.
You go away.
I'll go in a second.
I just want to tell you there wasn't a day I didn't regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.
I'm not done.
The reason I never looked you up was because I was afraid you'd react just like the way you're reacting now.
Can't we just start from here?
Please?
No.
Sorry.
One last thing.
You came looking for family.
I'm family.
I'm it.
Now I'm done.
It's not like we're losing anything.
I guess you're right.
It's not like we know each other or have anything in common.
I don't know.
It's not like we don't have anything in common.
I mean, I like pizza.
I like pizza!
Wait, I like the Beatles.
Oh, my God!
So do l. Puppies.
Cute or ugly?
So cute!
You see?
But I'm still mad at you.
I know.
I'm mad at me too.
Do you want to get something to eat?
I'm kind of hungry.
Hey!
Me too!
Uncanny.
It looks like rain and I don't have my umbrella.
Me neither.
I really hate that.
Stop it.
Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
I was so nervous about that letter.
But the way you owned up to everything it just showed me how much you've grown.
I suppose.
You have, Ross.
You should give yourself credit.
My mom never thought this would work out.
She said, "Once a cheater, always a cheater".
I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
But if time was what you needed to gain a little perspective.
We were on a break!
-Coffeehouse?
-You bet.
It took two people to break up this relationship.
You and that girl, which yesterday you took full responsibility for.
I didn't know what I took responsibility for.
I didn't finish the letter.
I fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
It was 5:30 in the morning.
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Front and back!
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means "you are".
Y-O-U-R means "your".
I can't believe I thought of getting back with you!
We are so over.
Fine by me!
Those spelling tips will be handy Saturday nights at home playing Scrabble with Monica.
Sorry!
All that sleep you'll miss wishing you were with me!
Don't worry about me falling asleep.
I still have your letter!
Just so you know, it's not that common.
It doesn't happen to every guy.
And it is a big deal!
I knew it!
Gin.
We were playing gin?
If we were a couple, we could play naked.
-Would you stop?
-Okay.
All right.
All right.
I think you're great.
I think you're sweet and smart and I love you.
But you'll always be the guy who peed on me.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Wow.
That ripped.
That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.
Turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide.
You throw it out!
I get tetanus shots every time I get dressed!
We're not throwing it out.
I built it with my own hands!
How about we sell it?
All right.
But you'll have to tell them.
Can we stick you in another cabinet?
They seem all right with it!
The One with the Cat Hey, why did the chicken fall out of the tree?
Why?
Because you have doody on your head.
Yeah, it was funnier when Ben told it.
Hey, Monica.
It's Chip.
Who's Chip?
It was good running into you today.
My number is 555-9323.
Give me a call.
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.
You're so lucky!
He's like the most popular guy in school!
I know!
Chip?
Hi, it's Monica.
Oh, my God!
We just had the best conversation!
I was just leaving.
Good.
I've got a report to read.
It's eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.
Why?
Did you write it?
Look at that!
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.
Well, actually.
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Why don't you give him a call?
-Are you sure you want to hear this?
-I'm sure.
Chip!
Hi, it's Rachel.
Rachel Greene.
You left me a message?
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.
Monica Geller?
Oh, that's right!
He called to ask out Monica.
That's got to be embarrassing.
Dumb drunken bitch Thank you!
Here's a question.
Where'd you get the "finest oak east of the Mississippi"?
First tell us where you got the prettiest lace in the land.
It's your ad.
Looks good?
"Stunning entertainment center, fine Fine ltalian craftsmanship".
You're selling the entertainment center?
Why?
I love it.
-You want it?
-No.
Gepetto?
Five thousand dollars?
Are you insane?
The ad alone cost $300.
I'm changing it to $50 or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?
What do you do?
I can't believe you don't know.
I actually don't know.
Oh, my God, no!
Shoo, kitty!
There's a kitty in my guitar case.
Everyone's gonna want one.
Come on, you!
Crazy!
-Oh, my God!
-What?
Nothing.
What's wrong?
I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.
The mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?
That makes the fact that she owns beach-front property all the more impressive.
No.
She was a human lady.
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly.
The one that killed herself.
Have you been taking your grandmother's glaucoma medicine again?
No, Dr. Skeptismo.
I'm sure.
First of all, there's the feeling.
And for another, she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.
My mother's favorite fish was orange roughy.
Cats like fish.
You had me with orange felt.
Hi, Mommy!
I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.
-Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of -Let it go!
When were you going to tell me that you're dating Chip?
Now?
Can I go out with him?
No.
I can't believe you'd want to after what he did to me.
That thing at the prom?
I couldn't find him for hours!
He was having sex with Amy Welsh!
That was in high school.
How can it still bother you?
Oh, yeah, you're right, Moni-cow.
Okay, I hear you.
Why do you have to go out with Chip?
We went to different schools.
We went to the same school.
You went to one where you were popular.
You rode on Chip's motorcycle and wore his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band uniform that was specially made.
They had that specially made?
It was a Home Ec project.
Oh, my God!
They said it was for the mascot.
Back then I thought that I'd never get to go out with a Chip Matthews.
Now he's called me up and asked me out.
The fat girl inside me really wants to go.
I owe her this.
I never let her eat.
-You go out with him.
-Really?
If possible, could you leave him and have sex with another guy?
I'll try.
Any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
There were a couple calls, but they won't work out.
Joey has a very careful screening process.
Not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Stop it!
She keeps trying to get away.
Just like when she was alive.
How long is your mom going to be with us?
I'm not sure.
I guess until she gets used to the fact that there's a new mom.
Now she's worried that she'll be replaced.
That's not going to happen, is it?
I have to go make a call.
Why not use this phone?
I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
I just spelled the wrong word.
Anyway, I don't want to do it in front of someone with a tail.
Hey, you swore you would never tell.
So am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone else of a cat?
Ross, don't start.
You actually believe there's a woman inside that cat?
I believe it.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you You know what?
You won't suck me into this.
Sure I will.
Because you always have to be right.
I do not always have Okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
And you know what?
Actually, I do think Kirk was smarter than Spock.
You were kidding about the Kirk-Spock-thing, though, right?
That's pretty nice.
"Pretty nice"?
Pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.
We don't have $50.
But would you trade for it?
We got a canoe.
I don't think we need a canoe.
You got to take it.
Just take the entertainment center.
Then when you get home, throw the canoe away.
We're not throwing it away.
I built it.
Good for you!
You won't believe what I found on a telephone pole.
Look familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name "Julio".
Wait a minute.
This is not the same cat.
This cat's only this big.
A little girl's looking for this cat.
Know what that means?
Yeah!
$200 reward split five ways!
Do we have to tell her?
-Yes, we do.
-But it's made her so happy.
Little girl misses her cat.
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
I have to go have dinner with my son.
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her?
Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right.
He is right, isn't he?
This might be one time when he's wrong.
-You think?
-Oh, no.
He's right.
About your mom.
How's that going?
So great.
We took a nap together today.
Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.
I just feel so.
-All right!
-I'm coming already!
Not yet, not yet, not yet!
-Hello, Chip.
-How you doing?
I'm great!
Got a great job.
I have wonderful friends.
Though I'm not seeing anyone now, I've never felt better about myself.
So, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second.
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?
Amy Welsh?
I haven't seen her since So, Monica about ready?
-Wow, you look great.
-Thanks.
-Well, you guys have fun.
-Catch you later.
Bye, Chip.
-Are you sure you're okay about this?
-Actually Okay, great.
This is the unit for you.
Sturdy construction, tons of storage.
Some big enough to fit a grown man.
-What?
-Yeah, I got in there myself once.
My roommate bet me $5 I couldn't.
Then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
It was funny till I felt like it was a coffin.
No, you can't fit in there.
It's not deep enough.
Oh, yeah?
If I can't I'll knock $5 off the price.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
See?
I told you.
Sometimes I come in here just to get away from it.
Hey, a nickel!
Here we are.
You still have the Chipper!
The what?
That's what we called your motorcycle in high school.
A motorcycle's a chopper.
And you're Chip.
Never mind.
I think it's cute.
A lipper from Chipper.
Are you still in touch with anyone?
There's Rachel and that's it.
How about you?
I still hang with Simens and Zana.
I see Spindler, Levine, Kelly.
I run into Goldie Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire J.T., Beardsley.
Is that all?
After high school, you kind of lose touch.
I ran into Richard Dorfman.
-How is he?
-Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect?
They still wear underwear.
Oh, my God!
What?
Are you all right?
What happened?
Oh, man, he promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
How were you locked in?
Where the hell is all of our stuff?
This guy came by to look at the unit and he said it won't fit a grown man.
So you got in voluntarily?
I was trying to make a sale!
If I ever run into him, you know what I'll do?
Bend over?
And then Zana just let one rip!
Not that I don't enjoy talking about high school because I do.
Maybe we can talk about something else.
I don't know where you work.
-You know where I work.
-I do?
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.
Still at the Multiplex?
Like I'd give up that job!
Free popcorn and candy anytime I want?
I can get you posters.
Thanks, I'm set.
Oh, you know who came in the other night?
Peters.
Told me he just went out with Leslie Maskin.
Got to third base.
Do you still live with your parents?
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
You know, with all of our stuff gone, the unit doesn't seem that big.
Why couldn't he have been a kidnapper.
They really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.
Your microwave, the stereo.
Man, he took the five of spades!
No, here it is.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Joey was born, and then So how was your date?
Well, I always wanted to go out with Chip in high school.
Tonight, I actually went out with Chip in high school.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Not only did I get to go out with Chip I got to dump Chip.
-That's so great!
-I know.
What did the insurance company say?
They said, "You don't have insurance.
Stop calling us".
You didn't tell her?
Okay, fine.
Listen this cat belongs to a little girl.
There are flyers all over the place.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
We can take her back with you if you want.
But, you know, she chose to find me.
I have to respect her decision, right?
-That's a good call.
-That's right.
Enough is enough.
I'm sorry you feel guilty about spending time with your new mom.
But this isn't your old mom.
This is a cat.
Julio the cat.
Not Mom!
Cat.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
Then you don't know how it feels when one of them comes back.
I believe this is my mother.
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
Just be a friend, okay?
Be supportive.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't know what to say.
You could say you're sorry to her mom.
I think she would like that.
Come here.
Here, come here.
Mrs. Buffay?
Sorry about what I said.
It was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat when, clearly, you are also the reincarnated spirit of my friend's mother.
Thank you.
We both forgive you.
What will you do about the little girl?
Listen.
Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me.
You're welcome to come back anytime.
If she'd come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Come on.
I'll take you home.
-I'll go with you.
-Me too.
I got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
You know.
It's peaceful out here.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
We are so in luck!
Treeger said we could have all this cool stuff!
Wait right there.
Oh, no.
I'm paddling away.
Really?
We got all this rusty crap for free?
This and a bunch of bubble wrap.
And some of it is not even popped.
Could we be more white trash?
The One with the Cuffs How desperate am l?
Good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.
I just told my mom I'd cater her party.
-How come?
-I need the money.
It'd be a great way to get rid of that last smidgen of self-respect.
I think this is a good thing.
Mom wouldn't have hired you if you weren't good.
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.
Do you have any juice?
Just pickle.
Funny story.
I bumped into Joanna yesterday.
My boss, Joanna?
That must have been awkward.
Actually, she asked me if I wanted a drink.
You didn't say yes to that, did you?
Hello, Rachel.
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
Last time you went out with her you said she was a dud!
I judged her too quickly.
This time, we took it to the next level.
Last time I almost got fired.
You must end it.
You must end it now.
It's not an everyday occurrence!
Usually I'm in there by myself.
Promise.
-Rachel, aren't you running late?
-No -You are if you pick me up a bagel.
-Okay.
Promise you will end this now.
-I promise.
I'll end it.
-Thank you.
I hope you know what I'm giving up.
She's not just the boss in your office.
You know what I mean?
Sorry.
I knew what he meant.
How's the hired help?
Doing great.
Quiches are coming along.
What's this?
Blue nail polish?
I thought it was cute.
It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you hire me?
Richard raved about the food at his party but you were sleeping with him.
Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was nice.
I assume you didn't sleep with anyone there.
At least that would be something.
Oh, my God!
Did you hear that?
She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
I didn't hear that.
She didn't hire me out of pity.
It wasn't so she could pick on me.
She actually thinks I'm good.
And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian.
Good afternoon.
Are you the decision-maker of the house?
Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?
No, but try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.
Actually, I'm not buying.
I'm selling.
Let me ask you one question.
Do your friends ever have a conversation and you just nod along, not sure what they're talking about?
I'm telling you, it's totally unconstitutional.
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
It was like the Algonquin kids' table.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
You haven't said anything for about two minutes.
Are you at all interested?
Come on in.
-That's weird.
-What?
Your nails.
I wore fake ones so my mom wouldn't give me grief about biting them.
I meant, it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh, my God!
Wait a minute.
I had them when I put Oh, my God!
It's in the quiche!
-Oh, my God!
-Okay, don't panic.
I'll go buy you a new set of nails.
No one will know, and you'll look great!
It's because they're going to eat That's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Please don't freak out.
There's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.
And there's no way to know which one.
And whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
-Why are you laughing?
-Now your father owes me $5.
You bet I'd lose a nail?
Don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.
Frozen lasagnas?
You bet that I'd screw up?
All that stuff about how I was good No, that was all true.
This was just in case you "pulled a Monica".
You promised Dr. Weinberg you'd never use that phrase.
Come on.
Have a sense of humor.
You're never able to laugh at yourself.
That's right.
My mom has no faith in me!
That's hilarious!
I don't get it.
No.
I have faith.
No.
You have lasagnas!
The ruined quiches are ready!
-I really don't think we should be doing this.
-Okay.
It just doesn't feel like we're breaking up.
No, we are.
I'm sad.
Can you wait till tomorrow?
All right.
Unbelievable!
Thanks.
That was my boss.
I have to go.
What are you doing?
-I'm getting dressed.
-Why?
When I walk outside naked, people throw garbage.
Wait.
I want to show you something.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.
Put your hands together.
You're not the boss of me.
Yeah, you are.
Saucy!
I'll be back in two minutes.
You're going to leave me like this?
Knowing you're here waiting for me.
I think it's exciting, don't you?
If you don't come back soon there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
I brought you back a macaroon.
Great.
I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
That's weird.
She locked the door.
You know why?
She's got the bonus list in there.
I saw her working on it today.
Swear you won't tell.
When Mark left, he gave me a key to her office.
You want to see the list?
How are you?
Hello, Joanna office.
I'm sorry.
I'll be a little longer.
-How little?
-A couple hours.
This isn't funny.
Get back here now!
-I can't!
-Why not?
I'm in my boss' car.
-What?
-Tunnel!
What?
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Okay, here's the situation.
The keys to the cuffs are on the door.
Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?
And on a totally separate subject, that's a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her.
I did break up with her!
She just took it really, really well!
Jeopardizing my career never entered your mind?
It did enter my mind.
But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
You got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out.
I can't get myself right out of them.
You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!
Unlock me!
She could be gone for hours, and I'm cold and.
All right!
This is it!
Never see her again.
Never!
-Never come in here again.
-Fine!
Give me back my Walkman!
I never borrowed it.
Then I lost it.
Buy me one!
You got it!
Here we go!
Come on.
This is great!
Does it hurt?
No, I always see guys do this when handcuffs are taken off.
Hello, sweet pants!
Wait!
What will you tell Joanna?
About what?
She'll see you're gone and know I let you out, and I'll get fired!
I'll tell a lie!
I'm good at lying!
I actually did borrow your Walkman!
She'll know I have a key to her office.
I've got to lock you back up.
I don't think so.
This is much better.
Here's somebody interesting.
What do you know about Van Gogh?
-He cut off his ear.
-And?
I'm out.
He painted that.
That's pretty nice.
I thought he cut off his ear because he sucked.
-What else you got in there?
-Let's see.
-Where does the Pope live?
-ln the woods.
Wait, that's the joke answer.
Actually, it's Vatican City.
Now, what do you know about vulcanized rubber?
Spock's birth control.
You need these books.
This used to be your room?
You must have been in really good shape as a kid.
I'm such an idiot!
I can't believe I thought she could change.
Who cares what your mom thinks?
So you "pulled a Monica".
I'm glad that's catching on.
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.
Prove your mother wrong.
You finish the job, and we'll call that "pulling a Monica".
What?
If a kid gets straight A's, his parents say, "You pulled a Monica".
A fireman saves a baby, and they go, "He pulled a Monica".
Someone hits a homer, and they say, "That one's out of here".
Because some things don't change.
All right.
I'll go down there.
I won't serve the lasagna.
I'll serve what I make.
My breasts are really strong.
I have to get you locked back up.
I'm so going to lose my job!
She's very private about her office!
Now I know why!
You're in trouble either way.
If she sees me locked to this she'll know you were here.
You might as well let me go.
-I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
-Still won't be clean.
All I want is my freedom.
-Foot rubs for a month!
-Freedom!
-I'll put all your photos into albums!
-I want my freedom!
Why won't you hear me!
Sophie, help me!
Sophie, sit!
Would you just calm down?
!
I'm going to say this for the last time.
Would you please just There's a lot I didn't know about vomit.
In a minute.
So what do you say?
You get the whole set of encyclopedias for $1200.
That works out to just 50 bucks a book.
$1200?
You think I have $1200?
I'm home during the day and I got patio furniture in my living room.
There's a few things you don't get from book learning.
Well, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have anything?
You want to see what I got?
I got a baby Tootsie Roll a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex a rock and an army man.
Okay, I get the picture.
Thanks for your time.
And a fifty.
These must be Chandler's pants.
For $50 you can get one book.
What will it be?
A?
B?
C?
I'll stick with the V. I want to see how this bad boy turns out.
I will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts!
I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
-With extra pulp?
-Yeah.
I've got it!
You don't have it.
I have so got it!
There will be rumors about this.
No way to stop it.
Sophie, Monica and Phoebe know.
-How do they know?
-I called them.
When they ask me what I saw I can be very generous or very stingy.
Go on.
I can make you a legend.
I can make you this generation's Milton Berle.
-And Milton Berle has -Not compared to you.
They're not even touching the lasagna.
They love your casserole!
It's hard to believe a while ago this was just ingredients.
Everyone seems to like your dish.
And you?
I thought it was quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it that would make this a success.
Which would make you.
A bitch?
I meant "wrong," but we can use your word.
Yes, well, I was wrong.
And I have to say you really impressed me today.
You might even say that she "pulled a Monica".
She doesn't know we switched it.
And the next time you cater for me there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
That really means a lot.
Mom, don't bite your nails!
Hello, Chandler.
I love you.
What's going on?
No, he doesn't!
Two hours, that lasted.
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
It's good you got out, before she blew up like Vesuvius.
The volcano?
Speaking of volcanoes, man, are they a violent igneous rock formation!
What?
Lava spewing, hot ash.
Of course, some are dormant.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of a sudden?
We don't have to.
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?
The vas deferens?
The Vietnam War?
Did anyone see that documentary on the Korean War?
Korea's a beautiful country.
With such a sad history.
Could there be more Kims?
-Who's out there?
-Me!
Good morning!
Could you come in here, please?
Sure!
They didn't have poppyseed bagels so I have sesame Oh, my word!
I've had a slight office mishap.
Could you get the key for me?
-lf you could.
-Oh, I'm sorry!
You can tell your friend Chandler we're definitely broken up this time!
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Hey, new wallet?
It was time.
The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say "cool" anymore.
Rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.
I know, but the garbage was full.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Since you've lived here?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
-Third door on the left.
-Right!
Hey, Mr. Treeger.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It's a little old but.
You're clogging up the chute I just unclogged.
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.
Of course not.
You're a little princess.
Daddy, buy me a pizza.
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.
Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing "Happy Birthday" to me.
You think you can come here make a mess and a big man in coveralls will clean it up?
Think of someone else for a change.
Okay, I'm sorry.
God, if you're going to cry about it!
The One With Ballroom Dancing Treeger made you cry?
He said really mean things that were only partly true.
I'll teach him a lesson.
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!
All right, that's it.
School is in session!
Is this a gym card?
Oh, yeah, gym member.
I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last 1200 times.
So why don't you quit?
You don't think I've tried?
You think I like having $50 a month taken from my account?
They make you go all the way down there.
They use all these phrases and peppiness to confuse you.
And then they bring out Maria.
-Who is Maria?
-Oh, Maria!
You can't say no to her.
She's like this lycra, spandex-covered, gym treat.
Do you need me to go with you and hold your hand?
You're strong enough to face her?
Oh, no.
You'll have to come.
Tribbiani.
Hold on.
I'll get the plunger.
You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.
So you'll go and apologize to her unless you want me to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Maybe you haven't heard of "not making girls cry".
Maybe you haven't heard of the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.
I have actually not heard of that.
Your friends are violating it.
I've been nice until now, but I don't need this grief.
I'm telling the landlord Monica's illegally subletting her grandmother's place.
Your friends are out of here, pal.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know?
Somebody tell me I don't have to work today.
What's the matter?
My first massage is this incredibly gorgeous guy.
Every time I see him, I want to do things to him I can't charge for.
So do them for free.
No, it is forbidden.
Mrs. Potter fires people for messing around with clients.
And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
-They make you take an oath?
-No, I made myself take one.
No fooling around with clients and always be prepared.
That one's from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Why not give him to someone else?
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.
Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
You got a pedicure.
Your feet are all dressed up.
That's the only part he can see when he's on the table!
You're going to do some feet flirting!
I don't know what you're talking about.
How do you explain the toe ring?
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!
My hero!
What happened?
I told him no one treats my friends like that.
And he better apologize.
See you!
Wait a minute.
What did he say?
He wouldn't apologize because you're living here illegally.
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!
-You got us evicted?
-I told you not to go down there.
He made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
You go down there, and you suck up to him.
You suck like you've never sucked before!
All right, I'll try.
If I can't, you stay with us till you get settled.
-Go!
-All right, all right.
I'll have to check first, but he'll be cool.
Remember what we talked about.
You got to be strong.
Now one more time.
Don't you want a washboard stomach and rock-hard pecs?
No, I want a flabby gut and saggy man-breasts.
That's good.
I want to quit the gym.
You want to quit?
I want to quit the gym.
You do realize you won't have access to our new Swedish spa?
I want to quit the gym.
Dave in the membership office handles quitters.
Excuse me.
Are you a member?
Me?
Sorry.
Members only.
I want to quit the gym!
It's okay, man.
Be strong.
Are you a member of any gym?
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.
Okay, no problem.
Could you come here?
Hi, I'm Maria.
You have really pretty feet.
These old things?
Would you spend time on my sciatic area?
It's killing me.
You mean.
By sciatic, you mean the towel-covered portion?
Sure, I can do that.
Because the muscles in the sciatic area can get real nice and tight.
So tell me, Rick, how did you injure the area?
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
-Did you just bite me?
-No!
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
You can't.
Where would the chick and the duck live?
You have pets?
Those are nicknames.
I'm the "chick," and Chandler's the "duck".
I would've thought it was the other way around.
Come on.
Let the girls stay.
I'll do whatever you want.
Really?
You'd do anything?
Yeah, absolutely.
I got something.
What is it?
Can you be my dancing partner?
That's not prison lingo, is it?
I want to quit the gym.
Can you honestly tell me that you're Yes, yes.
Most of the time.
I mean, sure, I have my bad days, but then I remember what a cute smile I have.
We were voted "Best-equipped Gym in New York" two years running.
-Do you really want to give that up?
-Yes, I hate it here.
Everything that you have in here is very heavy.
Really?
Okay?
You want to make your friend work out alone?
-What friend?
-Your friend Ross.
Just joined.
His dancing partner?
There's this superintendents' dance, "The Super Ball".
He wants to impress Marge, this lady super he likes.
Why not practice with a girl?
He's too shy.
He's not good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right.
He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.
So did you quit?
I almost did.
Couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter.
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
I was just, you know, picturing you working out, and.
Well, that's it.
We're doomed.
They'll take $50 a month from our accounts for the rest of our lives.
What are we gonna do?
You could actually go to the gym.
Or we could go to the bank close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
You're a genius.
Oh, man!
But then, we won't be bank buddies.
Now there's two reasons.
You guys, remember that cute client I told you about?
I bit him.
-Where?
-On the tushy.
And that's not against your oath?
I know, but the moment I touch him I want to throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Next time, try to distract yourself.
Like when I'm doing something exciting and I don't want to get too excited.
I try and think of other things.
Like sandwiches and baseball and Chandler.
-Thank you.
-Oh, no, thank you.
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.
Okay, well just follow my lead.
Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?
Like get really drunk?
Come on.
Hey, just put your arms around me.
I'm sorry.
No.
It's okay.
But if I'm Marge my breasts are coming out my back.
Forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.
My mom was right.
I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.
Marge will never go for me.
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.
You just need more practice.
Come on.
Let's try it again.
Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.
I'm not that comfortable dancing with a So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?
You guys owe me bigtime.
What was that?
You just did a little dancy thing.
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.
-You did a little hop.
-You are so enjoying this.
No, I'm not.
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourree.
You know the words!
You are so into this!
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.
This isn't some kind of girly dance.
It's like a sport, it's manly.
-Show me some "manly" moves.
-All right.
I don't know how to lead.
Hello.
We'd like to close our accounts.
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?
No, we'd just like to close them.
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.
Would you come over here, please?
Hi, I'm Karen.
I want to quit the bank!
Okay.
Baseball.
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.
Maybe even his pants come down a little.
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches.
Okay, on a plate.
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
Chandler.
Okay, Chandler.
That's working!
Chandler's knees.
Chandler's ankles.
Chandler's ankle hair.
Oh, no!
Okay, you're all set.
Wow!
That was amazing!
Was that really just an hour?
In really long-hour world.
What?
I have an enormous crush on you.
But since you're a client, I can't ask you out even though you give me the feelings.
I had no idea.
I can always find another masseuse.
Really?
Yeah, really.
What?
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.
Quiet down.
Mr. Simon's been waiting Oh, my God!
Why wasn't I offered that?
I'd definitely pay more for that.
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.
I know, but this isn't how it looks at all because Rick is my husband.
Oh, really?
You'd better tell his other wife.
She called three times asking where he is.
Yes, I will tell her.
So you didn't leave the bank?
And somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.
What will you ever use that for?
To pay for the gym.
So I had a great day.
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.
Then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
-You got fired?
-Oh, my gosh!
It's so weird.
I have never been fired from anything.
Sweetie.
I started walking around, not knowing what to do next.
I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages.
Then these policemen thought I was a whore too.
It's really been a bad day, whore-wise.
Hey, Duck.
Is Chick here?
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.
Ready for our last practice?
We're not getting that spin right because my place is too small.
-Want to use our place?
-No, I had another idea.
We did it!
That was incredible!
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.
Oh, my God!
Look at the time.
I got to catch the bus to the ball.
Good luck.
Unless you want to practice the fox trot.
Or the tango?
Thanks, but no.
You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
-Go get them, Treeger.
-Right.
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.
Really?
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.
No, I'm good.
It looks like you've got great experience.
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?
They thought I was a whore.
Okay.
We'll give you a call if anything comes up.
Great.
Thank you very much.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Joe, I don't think a four-letter word for "ship" can be "ship".
I thought it was a freebie.
Hello!
What's this?
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.
There it is.
Just a phone number a really hot girl gave me.
It's no big deal.
I mean, it is her home phone number, but.
Almost lost this baby!
The lovely Amanda gives me her number, and I go and drop it.
Thank you.
The One with Joey's New Girlfriend -When's your birthday?
-May 5th.
Why?
I'm making a list of birthdays.
-Mine's December -Yeah, whatever.
She's pretty!
Pretty, pretty girl.
The pretty She's pretty.
Go ask her out.
-What's the worst that could happen?
-I could die.
Yeah, it's tough being single.
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Ross, you guys went out once.
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I tell people secrets.
It makes them like me.
All I'm gonna say is, finally, it's nice to be in a mature relationship.
You know, the world would be such a better place if that actually was all you were gonna say.
Phoebe.
You're sick.
You shouldn't play.
Go home.
But I'm unemployed.
My music is all I really have now.
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go get shot down.
Any advice?
Just be yourself but not too much.
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
Wish it!
I was just sitting over there and.
My name's Chandler.
Did I say that?
No, you didn't.
Hi, I'm Kathy.
-Kathy with a K or a C?
-With a K. Wow, you are really good at this!
I'm out on a limb here!
I'm sorry.
You're right.
But I should tell you, I'm waiting for a date.
And there he is now!
I see you guys already met.
I was trying to demonstrate how I could get my very large feet into my even bigger mouth.
Didn't I tell you?
Always showing off.
Before I start, I want to say that I have a cold.
So if I sneeze during a song, it's not on purpose.
Except the last verse of "Pepper People".
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
This chick sounds good.
Smelly cat Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs thing I wanted to watch.
That's why I got up too.
You're kidding?
I love him!
My dad made me stay up and watch reruns with him.
Mine too.
Did your dad also make you watch the Mr. Universe contest?
-No.
-Well, me neither.
I'm sorry about this afternoon.
If I had known that you two, I never would have.
Oh, please.
Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
They teamed us up as partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us to do.
All of them had us making out.
That's a good thing because he used to make me rehearse with him.
-ls it on?
-No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!
Oh, my God!
It's on!
Here we go, little fella.
What about the duck?
The duck can swim.
My sticky shoes My sticky, sticky shoes Why you stick on me?
Baby Thanks for the lights, honey.
Way to go!
Your cold makes you sound great.
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.
I love them.
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.
-Well, have fun.
-Okay.
It's nice that the medical community is trying to help sick hamsters.
-lsn't it?
-Yeah, it's great.
You know what?
I like Kathy.
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.
She is.
She's smart and funny.
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about What?
You love her.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
Chandler loves Kathy.
-Come on, just lay off him.
-Thank you.
He's a little sensitive right now because he's so in love!
All right.
Kathy, I love you!
I need to write some depressing stuff to go with my new bluesy voice.
But nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
How about your mom dying?
Or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
I could write about the time my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.
Rachel's not here.
How's it going with her?
Great, actually.
I'm thinking tonight may be the night.
The kids are gonna play together, and then when they're asleep I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine do a little playing ourselves.
Hi, guys!
This is Josh.
Josh, these are my friends.
And that's Ross.
Dudes.
You played in college?
I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.
Didn't you play soccer in high school?
No, wait.
You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
It's getting late.
I gotta get to the game, so I'm gonnahead.
I'll miss you.
Dope!
Wow!
Cute one.
-Very cute.
-I know.
Isn't he great?
So nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know?
There's nothing boring about him.
I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Maybe he'll get to go soon.
Like on a class trip or something.
You know what else is great about him?
What is the word for an adult who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
What was that?
Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.
It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.
I cried the night you made that up.
It was the first time I realized I was cooler than my big brother.
I'm going to go get ready for my date tonight so I'll just "head".
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.
You guys should come hear me.
Hear me.
My sticky shoes I lost my sexy phlegm!
Hi, Ben.
-You look great!
-Thanks.
Hey, Tommy!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Oh, no.
It's my pleasure.
My cell phone number is here on the counter.
Please, help yourself to anything in the fridge.
I appreciate this so much.
I have been trying to go out with this guy for a month.
I'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep.
I blocked the adult channels for the other babysitters, but the code is four, three I'm fine.
Thanks for this.
I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Who wants to make some long-distance calls?
Kathy!
Kathy!
Hi!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Fetch!
Fetch it!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Chandler, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to say, "Hey"!
Hey.
Okay.
You're making it sound worse than it was.
Her date tipped me $10!
What are you doing?
I want to be sexy again, so I'm trying to catch a cold.
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.
You'll catch pneumonia!
Okay, you were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
-What?
-Are you serious?
How is that possible?
You barely know her.
I don't know.
I just I can't get her out of my head.
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.
I'm a horrible person.
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler"!
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
You mean you stole it!
Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
We were just talking about you.
Really?
The time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
-What movie did you get?
-I got what I always get.
Die Hard.
That's what I like about Joey.
Any other guy would have been: "Yeah, The English Patient is my favorite movie too".
But Joey goes, "No way.
Let's get Die Hard.
I'm not watching that English crap".
Yeah, he's dreamy.
I gotta go.
I gotta go meet some friends.
He has other friends?
Ninety-nine a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!
Let's go over the concept one more time.
You want to get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
You know what?
I already ate.
It's 4:30.
I had a big meal on Monday.
So that'll get me straight through the week.
I see what's going on here.
-You do?
-Yeah.
You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
You've been avoiding her ever since we started going out.
I made an effort to like Janice.
Now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out with us.
Right?
-Yeah, right.
-Good.
And hey, my treat.
-Only because you're not eating, right?
-Right.
Sorry, Grandma.
Ross isn't here.
Stop it!
I'll see you at the party?
Beer's fear, man!
Twenty-four, seven!
I am so gonna marry that guy.
What?
-I think he's stealing from me.
-Why?
Because he's stealing from me!
Hi, it's me and soup.
I just saw Josh.
He looked so yummy in your leather jacket.
I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.
There's no chicken in the broth, so it's really just noodle water.
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.
What are you doing?
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.
I miss my sexy voice.
Sorry, Phoebe.
It's okay.
How's the soup?
Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.
Is she great, or what?
What do you think?
She's not really my type.
Not your type?
She's gorgeous.
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings, it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Understanding a little more of why you're single.
I have a friend you'd like.
She's really pretty.
And then we could double date.
No, thanks.
I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'll be right back.
-What was that?
-What?
Kathy's being really nice and you just walked away.
What do you want from me?
I want you to like her.
If that's too damn difficult for you, then the least you could do is pretend.
-I am pretending.
-Then do it better.
What do you say I go over there and tell her how much I like her?
I can tell her how much I've been thinking of her.
I haven't stopped thinking about her since we met.
I'm so over the top, want-to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her that for every minute I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
That's pretty good.
But you might want to tone it down a little.
I still have a fever?
Are you sure that thing's working right?
Well, we could take it the other way.
So Amanda just dropped me off.
That's one of the things I love about her.
She's old enough to drive.
You're not going to Mom and Dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Where's Amanda?
Could you get me some cough drops?
I'm thinking you could bring her and you guys could go up to your old room and not make out.
Cough drop, please?
At least she's not going out with me to get into R-rated movies.
Why don't you just marry her?
Wait, you can't!
I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.
-Amanda and I have a -You have nothing!
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
That is so sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend -is-stealing-from-me?
So he stole a couple bucks from me.
Big deal!
At least he got me something with it.
That's mine!
Would you both please start acting like adults?
And give me my cough drops!
-Fine.
-Sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
At least I made $10 in my relationship.
You know?
Parading goats are parading Parading down the street Parading goats are parading Leaving little treats Does it even work without my sexy voice?
I like it.
-Gunther, kiss me.
-What?
Do it, deputy!
Do something!
We aren't exactly sleeping in here, but do you mind?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting For my papier-mache man Thank you, my babies.
Rachel?
Did you hear what happened between me and Phoebe?
We kissed.
I didn't initiate it, but I also didn't stop it.
I've been feeling guilty.
Okay.
So are we cool?
Okay.
I knew you would understand.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
-Thanks for the tasty dinner.
-You're welcome for a tasty dinner.
What are you guys looking at?
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Yeah, come to Papa!
I know!
Probably the only time I'll say this but did you see the ass on her?
What did you?
When did you?
How did you?
How did you get a girl like that?
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?
Actually, she's a paleontology doctoral candidate specializing in the Cenozoic Era.
But that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured.
But I made her dinner.
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.
Maybe her friends are betting to see who gets the biggest geek.
Fine by me.
Hope she wins.
Hey, we should have a contest.
Yeah.
See who can bring home the most beautiful woman.
That's a good idea, Joe.
We could call it life.
The One with the Dirty Girl You have any wrapping paper?
Is it for my birthday present?
It was your birthday months ago.
You said you ordered something special and it just hadn't come yet.
I have a call in about that.
It's for Kathy.
It's an early copy of her favorite book.
The Velveteen Rabbit!
When the boy's love makes the rabbit real.
Don't touch it because your fingers have destructive oils.
Then you'd better keep it away from Ross' hair.
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores talked to some dealers, called some of the author's grandchildren.
Honey, that's so sweet.
What a great way to say, "l secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend".
It doesn't say that.
Does it?
How will it look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive, and her boyfriend, Joey, gives her an orange?
I'll make sure Joey gets her something really great.
It's got to be better than that book.
Like a crossbow!
Once again, I am sorry.
Thank you.
Bye.
I had to turn down a job catering a funeral for 60 people.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
Sixty guests.
Why'd you have to turn it down?
I don't have the money or equipment to handle something that big on such short notice.
Wow, what is with all the negativity?
You sound like "Moni-can't," not "Moni-can"!
Moni-ca.
You've been playing around with this catering for years.
-Do you want to be a caterer?
-I don't know.
There you go!
That's the spirit!
If you need money, I will lend you money.
Just get moving!
Really?
I'd need $500 for all the food and supplies.
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!
-Neither have you.
-Yes, but I'm doing this.
That would be great!
Thank you.
-Can I borrow your apartment keys?
-Why?
You can pee here.
Yes, I can, of course.
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.
What are you getting for her birthday?
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?
You have to get her something really nice.
-I know!
-And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love".
-A crossword!
Can I help?
-No.
Last week I got all but three answers and I want to finish one without any help.
Fine.
But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
How'd it go?
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!
Everyone loved the food.
I even got another funeral for tomorrow.
The dead guy from today's best friend.
It's like I am the official caterer for that accident.
Mon, I'm so happy for you!
Thanks.
Check out my new catering stuff.
Look!
I'm an omelet station!
Omelet?
Made to order?
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.
I didn't realize you needed it right away.
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went.
I be'd.
I used it to buy all this stuff.
Aborigine.
I got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back then.
Okay.
Sorry I acted like a bank.
Aborigine.
Oh, no, I tried that already.
Would you like to come in?
Did Homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?
According to recent findings.
Here, Mitzi!
Here, Mitzi!
Mitzi is?
My hamster.
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.
Have a seat.
Where?
Oh, hey.
Do you.
Do you have any Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
Well, I do.
Let's go back to my place, light a couple candles break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties.
-I'd rather not.
-Oh, yeah?
Why not?
Don't take this the wrong way but your place kind of has a weird smell.
-ls everything in the car?
-Did you settle the bill?
I hate this part.
Look what we almost left!
That's not mine.
Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart?
Well, we're all cleaned up.
Good.
Thank you.
And, well, there's this small matter of the.
-Dear?
-The matter of payment.
Jack used to handle the finances.
-You get it?
-No, but I made a widow cry.
See you in hell.
You know what we should all do?
Go see a musical.
Sure.
You know which one?
The 1996 Tony Award winner.
I mean, that one's gotta be good.
Do you know the name of that one?
I don't know.
Grease?
Rent?
Yes!
Rent!
So when do you want to go?
What?
I'm sorry.
I can't, I'm busy.
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
Yes, it is at Office Max!
What did you get her?
A pen.
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock.
-You can't give her that.
-Why not?
She's not 11!
And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah.
What he means by that is, while this is a very nice gift maybe it's not something a boyfriend gives.
Sure it is.
She needs a pen for work.
She's writing.
She turns it over.
"It's time for my date with Joey"!
All right.
What did you get for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?
She didn't have one.
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition.
I can't shop anymore.
I will go out and try to find something for her.
Thanks, man.
While you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Or just get a card that has a poem already in it.
Oh, so it's a card, but it's also a poem-holder.
-You have to get our money.
-She couldn't stop crying.
With those thick glasses, her tears look giant.
I know, it's tough.
You know what the first thing I did after my mom's funeral was?
-What?
-Pay the caterer!
I've had a lot of jobs.
And there are some people who always try to get out of paying.
It's either "That massage wasn't long enough" or "l don't know any of those songs" or "These sombreros aren't big enough.
Bad little white girl"!
So you think she's faking?
There weren't any tears till you showed her the bill.
She sounded pretty upset to me.
She seems fine now.
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?
You throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day.
Like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived.
-Here.
-Wow.
Thanks.
So what happened?
Nothing.
I had to get out of there.
Next time, you take her to your place.
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.
-What kind of smell?
-I don't know.
Soap?
-Listen, you like this girl, right?
-Yeah.
-You want to see her again?
-Yeah.
So you're going to have to do it in the mess!
Yeah, okay.
You're right.
I mean, who cares about a little sloppiness?
-It's endearing, really.
-All right!
Now you go get that beautiful pig!
I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
Yeah, I found this great place called "lnvisible Things for Kathy".
Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
Just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen and you get her something worse than that Iike a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know?
The bottom line is, I want her to have it even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Honey, that's so sweet.
You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh, "pathetic"!
I've been looking all over for you.
-Where?
-Our place.
The hall.
I got something for her.
It's a book.
A book?
Is it a book that's also a safe?
It's a book that's just a book.
It's the Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.
So just let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it.
Thanks for doing this.
I owe you one.
There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow.
That's almost as much as a new book.
-You didn't get the money?
-Maybe I can try at intermission?
You know what?
Let's just go.
We're not leaving till we get paid!
I don't know who she thinks she is.
I talked to the florist.
She didn't get paid either.
Or the limo driver, or the priest, and he can get the dead guy damned for all eternity.
Well, I'm not going back out there.
Fine.
Enough is enough!
Hey, widow?
Widow?
Excuse me?
Excuse me!
Thanks.
Clearly this is a very, very hard time for you.
But we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service.
We are not leaving here until we are paid every penny, because we're part-time caterers and we have no place else to go.
All right.
I'll get my bag.
Good.
I'm going to leave some cards here.
Please think of us for your next event.
So you want to come inside?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.
Guess who?
Department of Sanitation?
It's me.
What?
Oh, Cheryl!
-It's my hamster!
It's Mitzi!
-Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.
Thank God it's not Mitzi!
It's just a rat.
I did it!
I finished it!
I did it all by myself!
And there's nobody to hug.
Move!
Hey, you guys!
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
How did it go?
The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her till she did.
I'm a hard-ass.
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.
Wait a minute, Phoebe.
We should be partners.
We should be catering partners.
You're not working now, and we have a great time together.
I cook and you take care of the money.
It'll be like I have a wife in the 50s!
How did she like the gift?
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.
Yeah?
That's great.
I got to tell you I feel bad taking credit for this, because am I going to get a lot of credit for this!
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.
You know, Chandler got you a gift too.
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did.
Look, it's right there on the counter.
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to.
You think it's just a pen, but you turn it over and it's also a clock.
No, this is great!
-Thank you, Chandler.
-Oh, yeah.
Want to go to bed?
I'll be in, in a minute.
Don't forget your coupon.
Good night.
Thank you for the gift.
I just knew that sometimes when you're writing you don't always know the exact time.
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.
The book?
The Velveteen Rabbit?
I have a feeling you had something to do with it.
What do you mean?
When Joey gave it to me he said: "This is because I know you like rabbits, and I know you like cheese".
Thanks.
I love it.
I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
In case you missed that, that sound was, "Oh, well".
You must really like Joey to go to all that trouble.
Oh, yeah.
He's my He's my best friend.
-Well.
-Good night.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
You don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.
You know, it's too bad that didn't work out.
Anyway, he told me about your apartment.
Well, I couldn't sleep thinking about it.
So would it be okay if I cleaned it?
I won't be able to sleep.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I just saw Kathy naked.
It was like torture.
If we go to war and you're captured, you're in for a surprise.
It keeps getting worse.
It bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend.
Every time we're in the same room, there's weird energy between us.
Call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
And now I have seen her naked.
At least with her clothes on I could imagine her body was covered in boils.
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.
Smooth!
-Could everyone see up his robe?
-Oh, my God!
The One Where Chandler Crosses the Line -Here you go.
-I'll call you.
Great!
Hey, hey.
Who was that?
Casey.
We're going out tonight.
Going out?
Wow!
It didn't work out with Kathy?
Bummer.
No, things are fine.
I'm having a late meal with her after an early one with Casey.
-What?
-Yeah.
The craziest thing is, I just ate a whole pizza myself.
You're going out with Kathy!
Yeah.
Why are you upset?
Well, I'm upset for you.
Sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be unfulfilling.
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey.
Kathy's clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
But, Casey.
Granted, I just saw the back of her head.
But I got this sense that she's smart and funny and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
I think it's time for you to settle down.
Make a choice.
Pick a lane.
Who's Elaine?
Little Tony Tarzan Swinging on a nose hair Swinging with the greatest of ease I don't know the next verse.
You could just go: Greatest of ease Then go right into it.
I like that.
How do you know about?
You know, I used to play.
That's right.
The keyboards?
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.
That's when I really found my sound.
Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was worth it.
Oh, my God!
I completely forgot about your sound.
He'd lock himself in the basement for hours.
No one was ever allowed to hear the sound.
I want to hear the sound.
No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.
Well, it's really personal stuff.
Play that funky music, white boy.
-Yeah, come on.
-No, you guys.
My keyboards are all the way Yeah, okay.
Who wants to get dinner later?
I wanna try that new ltalian restaurant.
Supposed to be really good.
Saw a lot of Chinese people eating in there.
What are you talking about?
You said some restaurant must be good because Chinese people were eating there.
That's because it was a Chinese restaurant.
I still wanna go.
Who wants to come?
Oh, I can't.
I got two dinner dates tonight, so I gotta get ready.
All right, girls' night out.
Sorry, but we have to prep that catering thing for tomorrow.
Oh, that's right.
I wish I could eat in restaurants alone.
You should try it.
It's a really good thing to do.
I just think I'd feel really self-conscious.
Like I was on display or something.
I was on display once.
Nothing like eating alone.
I just had a great time with myself.
Well, this could be a good story.
At dinner.
It was so liberating.
You know, I don't need people to have fun.
I'm fun.
I'm a fun girl.
Are you a naughty girl?
No, just fun.
Fun.
Good.
Fun.
-See, I told you you'd have fun.
-I know.
Although I must say that I totally judge any woman I see eating alone.
-Why?
-What's wrong with a woman eating alone?
Well, obviously something.
She's eating alone.
Okay, guys.
All right!
Bring it on, you!
Here we go.
You know, I've never played my stuff for anyone before.
So it's important that you understand it's about communicating very private emotions.
You know.
You should think of my work as wordless sound poems.
-That's what -Oh, my God, play.
Well, you know, that was terrific!
Really bitchen.
Wow!
It was so wow!
Really?
Yeah!
I mean, you should play in public.
Wow, thanks, you guys.
That's I want to play you another piece.
I left my helicopter sounds on another disk.
I'll be right back, okay?
This is so nice.
I mean, I am so.
God bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.
I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it!
It was so moving.
It's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean, music?
I know what you think.
Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Come in.
Oh, God!
Is that Baywatch?
Yes, but I just watch it for the articles.
-So is Joey around?
-No, he's not back yet.
Come in, have a seat.
Bow or stern?
I don't have a preference.
You?
I like it in the stern.
Of the boat.
It's me.
Casey and l had a little car trouble.
-What happened?
-We broke down.
I have to get transmission fluid.
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry and I'll be there soon.
-Why can't you tell her?
-I think my time is about to I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have Joey's running a little late, and he says he's sorry.
I guess it's just you and me, then.
-Okay.
-Yeah, I think it is.
So, what'd you do today?
I had an appointment to cut my hair.
-Looks great!
-And then it got canceled.
-I could cut it.
-Really?
Do you do that?
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's dog-grooming shop.
What do you say?
Dog grooming?
Don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Oh, thanks.
I grow it myself.
You know who also has great hair is Joey.
Yes, Joey has great hair.
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.
What are you doing?
Checking to see if it's even.
Looks good.
The phone!
The phone's making sounds!
Hey, dude, it's me.
Hey, it's Joey!
It looks like we'll be stuck here.
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.
-What?
-It fell out.
I just figured we hit a dog.
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.
It's Joey.
No, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, no, stop apologizing.
It's okay.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should probably go.
I forgot my purse.
I really did.
I forgot my purse.
-This is bad!
It's bad!
-Horrible!
Wait, the kiss or the situation?
The kiss was good.
-But that's bad!
-Here's what we do.
-We forget it happened.
-What?
We swallow our feelings, even if we're unhappy forever.
Sound good?
Can you really do that?
I have to.
He's my best friend.
And you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
-But with you -No, don't!
Don't, see?
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.
I'm sorry.
If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I think we have to.
Are you still out there?
Electrifying Infinite time There's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
He's so inspired.
Just look at him.
Look at him go!
Thank you very much!
Hey, aren't you up next?
-I'm not playing tonight.
-Why not?
I can't follow Ross.
It'd be like those poor bicycle-riding chimps who had to follow the Beatles.
No.
Ross sucks.
The place has emptied because of him.
Oh, my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.
I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
You suck too.
You're awful.
You guys!
You suck too!
Man!
I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Hang on, buddy.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
-Did you do all this?
Why?
-I sure did.
It made me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
You're amazing.
No, this is amazing.
A TV that appears as if from nowhere!
That's the dream!
How did you afford all this?
I'm 29.
I mean, who needs a savings account?
You're the best friend anyone has ever had.
I don't know.
No, you are.
You do this, you give me advice.
What you said about focusing on one woman?
I'll do that.
With Casey?
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.
-Or Casey.
-No, Kathy.
-Could be Casey.
-No, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.
You were really great.
You were really, really great.
Thanks.
Monica tells me you don't want to play anymore because of me and, you know, my talent.
Is that true?
Well, kind of, yeah.
I was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it but I just feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
See, but.
Pheebs, that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
You know, my music is meant to inspire.
If it bothers you this much then I won't play anymore.
No, don't do that.
How could I live if I knew I was depriving the world of your music?
Yeah, okay.
-I'd love to, but I have plans on Sunday.
-Well, maybe some other time.
-Sure.
Just give me a call, I'm in the book.
-Okay.
Thanks a lot.
See you.
What are you doing?
He is cute, and he's a doctor.
-How do you know?
-Honey, I eavesdrop because I care.
-Well, I have plans on Sunday.
-With who?
-Me.
-Oh, God.
You are the one who told me how important it is to spend time alone.
I can't just go out with that guy when I have plans with myself.
Wouldn't be fair to me.
So basically you're saying you don't want to cheat on yourself.
Well, if you wanna make me sound crazy.
Saw the new furniture.
Very nice.
Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
Are you serious?
-Does Joey know?
-No.
Is there any way you think he will understand this?
You obviously haven't screwed over your friends.
Which we all appreciate.
If you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her knowing Joey, he'd have stepped aside.
Don't say that!
That's not true, is it?
Yeah, he loves you.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
I said something to Phoebe.
And I thought it was a really good idea.
-Yeah, I remember.
-Oh, my God!
What am I going to do?
-You'll have to tell him.
-Why do I have to tell him?
-Because you do.
-Yeah, I know.
Would it be okay if I wrote a song about this?
I don't know if this is working out.
I think.
I think I wanna see other people.
Wow.
Didn't see that coming.
It's not that I don't enjoy this.
I do.
I just wanna see what else is out there.
Hey, Guy.
What are you doing here?
I work across the street.
-lt turns out I'm gonna be free Sunday.
-I wish you had called me.
I just told them I'd work this weekend.
Okay, well, maybe next weekend.
-Definitely.
I'll see you.
-Okay.
Yeah, you'll be talking to me never, because you're a freak who eats alone.
Sambuca margarita?
It that a real thing?
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
Listen, Joe.
I need to I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
It's about Kathy.
I like her.
I like her a lot, actually.
-You do?
-Yeah.
Your timing couldn't be better.
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
What?
-Yeah, she broke up with me.
-When?
Just now, after acting class.
I thought she was doing some scene, so I let people watch.
Man, I am so sorry.
Are you okay?
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?
Yes, but I don't have to.
No, it's okay.
You know why?
Because you came to me first.
I thought that would be the best thing to do.
You might have your work cut out for you.
When I talked to her, I got the feeling she's into some other guy.
See, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
It's me.
I'm the other guy.
What?
When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and one thing led to another, and.
And what?
Did you sleep with her?
-No, I just kissed her.
-What?
That's even worse!
-How is that worse?
-It's the same!
There's nothing I could do.
I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you!
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.
You're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line!
The line is a dot to you!
Yes, right!
And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.
Oh, my God.
Is that why you bought all this stuff?
You know what?
I will not watch your TV.
I won't listen to your stereo.
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker I won't eat.
Know why?
-Probably because -It's all tainted with your betrayal!
This apartment is empty to me!
I'm not happy about you either.
And just so you know I made that bread for you.
Oh, my God!
He's lost it.
He's totally lost it.
What?
This cannot get any worse.
Rats in the basement are hanging themselves.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I lost it.
I won't play anymore.
Would you?
Can you finish my set?
After that?
Yeah.
No, I mean, if I can help.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
What?
I played bad on purpose, guys.
Okay, you were trying to play bad this whole time.
No.
Just that last song.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
It's me.
I know you can 't stand to see me.
I'm trying to apologize over the phone I shouldn't have kissed your girlfriend Stop calling!
This is 92.3 WXRK, K-Rock calling with our $ 1000 daily challenge!
All right!
What is the name of your roommate who is very sorry and would do anything?
-Damn it, Chandler, stop calling.
-Joey, it's Ross.
-Sorry.
-It's all right.
What's up?
Not much.
I got Chandler here and he's really, really sorry The One with Chandler in a Box Oh, turkey!
Giving thanks!
Look, everyone.
It's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Are things with Joey better?
They couldn't be worse.
I spent eight hours calling him trying to get him to talk to me.
Eight hours.
You could probably use a plug-in telephone headset.
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that are stolen from your office?
You shouldn't.
Speaking of Christmas.
Since Monica and I are starting a new business and have no money this year we could do Secret Santa and each only buy one gift.
And there's the added mystery of who gets who.
Who gets whom.
I don't know why I do that.
But it is correct.
Hey, what's this?
It's all of your names.
Let's pick.
Hey, what's going?
-No, Joey, stay.
-We're picking names for Secret Santa.
Okay.
I invented Secret Santa, you know.
What are you laughing at?
You're the one who said Die Hard was your idea.
It was.
Don't make me show you the napkin.
I'm going to take a nap.
Turkey makes me sleepy.
We haven't eaten yet.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready and.
Did you pick Rachel for your Secret Santa?
I'll trade for her.
I picked her.
Thank God, you want her!
Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
She exchanges every gift she gets.
It's impossible to get her something she likes.
Come on, let's trade!
I got her that backpack and she loved it.
I remember she cried when that big dog ran off with There was no big dog.
This sucks!
I already got her a briefcase with "R.G." put on it.
Her initials.
Okay, I'm really bad at initials.
You got your shopping done early.
Yeah, well, my Camel Cash was about to expire.
Maybe you can give it to somebody else.
Like Ross Geller!
You know what?
It's a girlie briefcase.
Who cares!
He works in a museum.
The big game's about to start!
Ross and Joey aren't here.
You can watch the parade if you want.
Thanks.
What is wrong with this freezer?
-What happened?
-lce just got in my eye!
People are trying to sleep in here!
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts!
-Open it up.
Let me see.
-I can't.
It really kills.
Maybe you should put some ice on it.
-lt looks bad.
-We should take you to a doctor.
No, my eye doctor is Richard!
I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.
He's really picky about his patients.
You've got to go.
What's his office number?
Like I remember his office number!
Speed dial seven.
I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye.
Is Richard Burke in today?
He's not in.
Will she see the on-call doctor?
-Yes.
-She's very excited about that!
Okay, we'll be right in.
Okay, so who's gonna take her in?
I'll go, you can watch your parade.
It's so cool.
Till Monica gets back, I'm head chef.
And I get to make all the decisions.
She told you to follow the recipe exactly.
Get out of my kitchen.
I think I'm making some progress with Joey.
When I walked in, he went to his bedroom but he only slammed the door once.
Yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
I've got to call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.
I'm gonna be in there.
While I'm gone.
Chandler, you're in charge.
I picked Monica for Secret Santa, but I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
You want to switch?
I was trying to trade for you.
Really?
That's so nice.
What are you getting me?
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Then you'll get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift.
No, I got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like?
Like that gold necklace I got her last year.
When did she wear it last?
She wore it all Christmas day and then.
Big dog?
What are you doing?
Sending back this stuff Chandler bought.
-Even the TV?
-No, I'll put that in my room.
Listen, Joey.
I know what he did was wrong.
But can't you hear him out?
If Chandler had kissed Rachel, would you hear him out?
That's a good point.
How long you going to punish him?
Five years.
You've sentenced him?
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
The guy's your best friend.
Was my best friend.
I don't know why you're pushing for him.
With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
-Who, me?
-Yeah.
I'm honored.
You know what I'm going to do as your best friend?
I'm going to get you to talk to Chandler.
All right.
But if you weren't my best friend.
Oh, my God.
Is it really that bad?
I walk in the room, and he won't talk to me.
He just mumbles something in ltalian.
And I know he only knows the bad words.
I'm so, so sorry.
I feel responsible.
It's not your fault.
-Gunther, have you seen Chandler?
-I thought you were Chandler.
But one of you is over there.
Hey, Joe.
I'll be right with you.
Thanks for coming in.
Oh, my God!
How cute is the on-call doctor?
So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
-You have the best luck with eye doctors.
-I know.
Dr. Burke will see you now.
Not Dr. Burke.
The on-call doctor will see me now.
Dr. Richard Burke is out.
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Ready?
Hey, I'm sorry.
That -Where you going?
-My folks'.
When you coming back?
I don't know.
I might stay there while I look for an apartment.
What?
I thought we could talk about this.
Work it out.
Seeing you two together, I don't.
What do you want me to say?
Should I stop seeing her?
It's not about her.
Okay?
But seeing you together reminds me of what you did.
I won't live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
I know what it is to be a friend.
I screwed up.
Yeah, you did.
And that's why I'm leaving.
If you're not going to stay for me, then at least stay for them.
They had a very difficult year.
What with the robbery and all.
And that chick used to be very cute.
When that guy was robbing us and I was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours do you know what I was doing?
I was thinking about how I let you down.
If I knew what kind of friend you'd be, I wouldn't have worried.
Wait one second!
There has to be something that I can do.
If we still had that unit I'd get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.
What?
We got a box.
I remember the last time I saw you.
It was the morning I left for college.
You were standing outside the Dairy Queen.
Just probably waiting for it to open.
-You look great now.
-You look great too.
You're an excellent patient.
How does it look?
You have a scratch on your cornea.
You have to wear a patch.
Like a pirate?
If that helps you.
How long have you been working with your dad?
Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple months ago.
Big family dinner tonight?
No way!
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
But we broke up.
She wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey?
You're not wearing the patch yet.
I know.
-He's coming here for Thanksgiving?
-I know.
It's sick.
-Why is it sick?
-It's Richard's son!
It's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
If it were Greek, I'd be blind in both eyes.
I like him because he's handsome and he's nice and smart and handsome.
Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
I could see where I'd be your best shot, but no.
Sorry, honey.
I think it's twisted.
-What's twisted?
-Me going out with Richard's son.
It sounds like a really bad idea to me.
-ls he okay in there?
-He's fine!
If things work out between you and Richard's son you can tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
Judge all you want to.
Married a lesbian, left a man at the altar Ioved a gay ice dancer threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box!
What exactly is the point of the box?
The meaning of the box is threefold.
One, it gives me the time to think about what I did.
Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey.
And three it hurts.
And if he stays in the box you guys will be friends again?
Let's just say it's a start.
Remember that necklace I gave you last year?
Can I see it?
Why?
I just want to check something.
Okay.
Now we'll see.
Air hole!
Air hole!
Here it is.
I love it.
I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold.
This is silver.
Well, maybe it changed.
Oh, my God!
You actually exchanged it.
Isn't it better to exchange it for something I enjoy and can use a lot?
What did you get?
Credit.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Hi, Tim.
Thank you.
Come meet my friends.
Phoebe.
And Joey.
My brother, Ross.
And Rachel.
That's Chandler.
How do you do?
-What's?
-Well, he's.
He's doing some thinking.
-What happened?
-You kissed my girlfriend!
I like those sunglasses.
"Like them" like them?
Or "I'd like to get store credit" like them?
This turkey is ready.
Where can I wash up?
Let me show you.
The towels are hanging next to the sink.
-And you can use the fancy soap.
-Thank you.
Fancy soap?
I thought we were saving that for the pope.
See.
He's nice, right?
Do you want a relationship where you can actually say: "That's not how your dad used to do it"?
Everything looks great.
Where should I sit?
Saved you a seat.
Sick, sick, sick, sick.
I'll get it.
Got you!
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.
-Sorry!
-You shouldn't be talking at all.
You've got too much thinking to do to be talking and joking.
Okay, you got it!
Ross, pass me the yams?
Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Will you stop!
What's the matter with you?
We've got company.
Nothing's the matter with me.
I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm breaking the tension by mooning you guys.
All right, look!
If this is a big joke to you, forget about it.
This means something to me.
If it doesn't mean anything to you, then get out of there.
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
This means a lot to me.
I want to be friends again.
I swear I won't say another word.
-So you'll take this seriously?
-Absolutely!
That sounds like another word to me.
Are you going to take this seriously?
Okay!
Don't say that I have no sentiment.
This is a movie stub from our first date.
This eggshell is from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.
This is from the museum, the first time we were together.
Maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Though you're not supposed to take these.
It's, like, a million years old.
We actually have people looking for that.
-Mind if I smoke?
-Care if I die?
No, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.
Go ahead, smoke.
This always happens.
Here, let me.
Thank you.
You have very beautiful eye.
My friends think this is weird.
Even the one in the box?
It's not weird, is it?
I thought it would be.
I almost canceled, but it really isn't.
I know.
Me and your dad, that's totally separate.
I totally agree.
We're two people who find each other very attractive.
Right?
-What?
-Nothing, nothing.
No, really.
Was that not okay?
No, that was good.
That was a good kiss.
-lt reminded you of -Don't say it!
-lt did, didn't it?
-Yes!
I know!
God, I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
It's okay.
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a little emotional scarring.
You know what's even worse?
My friends were right.
You know what's worst for me is you remind me of a younger version of my mom.
-I want you to know how sorry I am -It's okay.
-Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
-Well, I'm still sorry.
-ls he here?
-ln the box.
He can't talk right now.
Why not?
What's going on?
He's trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
-By being in a box?
-Joey had reasons.
They were threefold.
You not being able to talk might make this easier.
Listen.
I don't want to be someone who comes between two best friends.
I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.
And I don't want to be the cause of that.
I don't think we can see each other anymore.
I'm going to my mom's in Chicago.
I'm going to stay there for a while.
I think this could have been something really amazing.
But, you know, this is probably for the best.
You know?
I'm going to miss you.
Goodbye, Chandler.
Open the box!
What?
He can still catch her.
Get out of there!
Get out of there!
We're going to be fine.
Get out!
You did some real good thinking in there.
I mean, this is.
You could still catch her!
And merry Christmas from your Secret Santa!
All right, who got Chandler?
Because I need to trade.
He sees her!
He's catching up to her.
She sees him!
They're hugging!
He's taking her purse.
That's not them.
I'll go call the police.
There they are!
All right, get a room.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Come on, no peeking.
Our eyes are closed, and we're crossing the street.
Very good.
Okay.
Open up!
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van!
It's for our catering business.
I think I know that girl.
We won't keep it this way, though.
We'll replace the sword with a baguette.
Oh, my God, I think I lost my virginity in that van.
Also, we don't know what to do with this.
Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
The One Where They're Going To Party!
Remember that guy from cooking school that put cilantro in everything?
Sure, Cilantro Larry!
I'm filling in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
What an amazing opportunity to influence dozens of people!
What about our catering business?
It's just one night a week.
Plus, I get to take you out for free dinners.
Well, in that case.
That was me, hopping on board.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Ross!
Quick question for you.
Are you ready to party?
I could maybe go out for a couple of beers.
There's this thing about bees on the Discovery Channel.
I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?
No.
Gandalf?
Gandalf is coming to town?
I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandalf, dude!
Dude, we are so going to party!
Wow, okay.
Dude alert!
Who is this guy?
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only the funnest guy in the world.
I'll call to get off work tomorrow.
I'll call after you!
This will be so cool!
We never party anymore.
Were you smoking something in the back of our van?
"We never have fun anymore"?
You have fun with me.
Remember those strippers?
And you paid me $50 to eat that book?
You are going to love this guy.
Gandalf is the party wizard.
Why do you call him "Gandalf"?
Gandalf the Wizard.
Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Joanna?
I was wondering if I could ask you something.
There's an opening for a buyer in Junior Miss -That'd be a step down for me.
-Actually, I meant for me.
The hiring committee is meeting people all day and.
I guess you can't stay my assistant forever.
Neither can you, Sophie, but for different reasons.
I'm so glad you don't have a problem.
If you did, I wouldn't apply.
In that case That's why I'm glad there's no problem.
I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be one friendly face.
That's great!
Junior Miss is where I started.
I slept with the ugliest guy to get that job.
-Really?
-No.
Yeah.
I mean, no.
With your qualifications, you won't need to sleep with some guy.
Although I might need some convincing.
Kidding!
God, I feel wild today!
Man, I am so excited, I may vomit.
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.
You don't understand.
He's amazing.
You never know what'll happen.
You go out for beer and end up on a boat to Nova Scotia.
-Really?
-It's beautiful country up there.
Hey.
Okay.
I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snakebite kit.
It won't be exactly like last time.
I'll see you guys.
I have an audition, but I'll meet you.
Where will you be around noon?
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Hello.
It's Gandalf!
So are you in town?
Oh, well.
Maybe next time, then.
What happened?
He can't come.
He's stuck in Chicago.
Oh, man!
Chicago's so lucky.
Stupid, useless Canadian money!
You have a very impressive resume, Miss Greene.
I especially like what I see about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Filing system?
Those colored labels you put on all the folders?
It did brighten up the filing cabinets.
They did more than that.
I notice you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.
Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Rachel has been incredible at getting my bagels.
She gets it right almost every time.
Of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Of course!
There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.
That's very good.
Now a big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
-Yes, l -She shouldn't have any problem.
Her only problem might be getting too friendly, you know?
I love working with designers.
With them.
Under them.
What's the difference?
My first review is out.
The Chelsea Reporter.
These used to keep me so warm.
Look, I'm on the back page.
"Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, I'd get two meals.
One for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head".
You really laid into this place.
They don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
I found a guy who'd fix up the van for catering.
You want me to go?
It's okay.
Are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Because it would be silly to take it out if we're just gonna put it back in again.
Haven't we made this decision?
Yeah, all right.
-Who is it?
-It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
-Oh, my God.
-I want to talk to you about your review.
Call me on the phone.
What?
So you can hang up on me?
I'll never let you up, so just go away.
-Just give me a chance to -Do you need to get in?
No, Phoebe!
Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill".
I couldn't eat it.
My five friends couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Our service isn't "grossly incompetent".
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants.
Well, you said that we accept the Discover Card which we do not!
All right, that I'll retract.
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.
Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice.
You should serve it with vodka and celery.
I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.
You own an ltalian restaurant, and you think that tastes good?
Where are you from?
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes.
I'll show you what it should taste like.
How long will this take?
I got another critic to yell at.
Joanna, I want to talk about that interview.
I thought it went very well.
No, it didn't.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Now just to brief you I may cry.
But they are not tears of sadness or of anger but just of us having this discussion.
Please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here.
Sophie, get in here.
See?
You're making Sophie uncomfortable.
No, she's not.
Congratulations.
You crossed the line into completely useless.
Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
What makes you think that?
Those things you said in the interview if you believe them, I must not be a good assistant.
You know what?
I am just going to pack up my desk and I will be gone by the end of the day.
There's no use staying till the end of the day.
Wait, wait.
You can put your sad little muffin back.
If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a good assistant.
What?
That's why I said those things about your flirting and drinking.
My drinking?
I must have said that after you left.
Said what, exactly?
You enjoy the occasional drink -ing binge.
Oh, my God!
That is it.
I'm leaving!
You are just a horrible person!
Wait, wait.
If you're going to get all sensitive about it.
I don't want to lose you.
What if I create a position for you?
I'll make you assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.
Your own office and a raise, effective tomorrow.
-I need an expense account.
-Done!
-And an assistant.
-Sophie!
Hey, I thought you'd be out partying with Gandol- -dorf.
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.
You've been sitting here all day?
I balanced my checkbook.
And I gave first names to all the foosball players.
I can't believe he didn't come.
So what?
We can still go out and party ourselves.
With Gandalf, we'd be out all night.
We'd meet total strangers and hang out with them.
We could do that.
There was other stuff too.
We'll do it all and better!
After tonight, Gandalf will want to party with us, dude!
It's not like we don't know how to party!
All right!
Let's go.
Maybe we could end up on a boat again?
All right!
When were we on a boat?
Remember that cold morning with those dogs licking your face?
Those were seals, man.
How would this suit look on an assistant buyer The owner of Allesandro's came to yell at me.
But I made him sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!
You just ruined the thing I was practicing, but I'm so happy!
Can you believe it?
I get to run my own kitchen!
Oh, you've waited so long.
Pheebs!
Quick question for you.
How would this suit look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
It would totally depend on her coloring and.
You got the job!
You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?
It'll be so great!
I'll help decide what we sell.
I'll have an office with walls and everything.
I'm going to have walls!
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.
The wedding reception.
I kind of need to talk to you about that.
I think it's time for me to take a step back from the catering.
But we've only had one job.
But now we have this second one, and it feels like it's snowballing.
What are you saying?
I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
It's okay, because you don't really need me.
You're the cook!
Without you, it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays, asking for money.
All right.
But I'll pay you back all the money you invested.
-And you can keep the van!
-For what?
I can't believe this!
I got to get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute.
I'm an assistant buyer!
We'll get coffee, get energized, then head back out.
-Yeah, all right.
-Okay.
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.
We hit some clubs, talk to some strangers then go down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I'm kind of beat.
Actually me too.
Are you serious?
Thank God!
I'm exhausted.
You guys want coffees?
I don't want to be up too late, so I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, me too.
Actually, could I get some hot water with lemon?
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?
I can't hear a word.
My ears are ringing so bad.
I was glad I had that extra pair of socks.
I used them as mittens.
I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
You know what?
We're not sad.
We're just not 21 anymore.
You know?
I'm 29 years old, damn it!
I want to sit in a comfortable chair, watch TV and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.
I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
And so what if I like to go home, put on Kenny G and take a bath?
We're 29.
We're not women.
There you are.
I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
Okay, I'm hearing.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I came up with a bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.
You could be a flower delivery person.
-What?
-Or a bakery delivery person?
Pizza?
I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area.
But I get the feeling you don't want to deliver.
-No.
-Okay.
I guess if you don't want to deliver you probably don't want to pick up stuff either.
No.
You know what?
Let's do the catering business.
-Really?
Are you sure?
-Yeah, I made a commitment to you.
It'd be fun.
It will be fun!
Let's plan the wedding reception.
You really wanted me to do something with this van.
You know what?
I want you to take the chef job.
-Really?
-Yeah.
That's what you really want.
I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy.
I'd be unhappy.
And I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
Thank you.
Besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new A-Team.
Hi, Mrs. Lynch.
Is Joanna in already?
Oh, my goodness!
You haven't heard.
-Heard what?
-Joanna passed away last night.
Oh, my God!
How?
She was leaving work, and she was hit by a cab.
Oh, my God!
I cannot believe it!
I know.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
I didn't realize that you were so close.
Yes.
So close!
I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
But by any chance, did Joanna send any paperwork your way before -it happened?
-No, nothing.
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.
Nothing about an assistant buyer?
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
Good morning!
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.
I sure did!
I'm excited about having Monica on board with us.
Although I do feel bad about having fired Chef Emilio.
It is like losing a member of the family.
Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
I know Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.
Well, you all read the review.
So without much further ado I present to you our new head chef.
I just want to say that with a pinch of excitement a dash of hard work and a dollop of cooperation we can have the recipe.
Are you going to kill me?
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos in his mouth.
Fifteen?
Your personal best!
Where were you?
On a date.
I met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate.
-Which museum?
-How'd you meet her?
No.
Answer his.
We were at the back of the train.
I sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burying this woman?
I'm late because she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems great, but she's two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie?
That joke would have killed in Albany.
Done!
I did it.
Who's stupid now?
The One with the Girl From Poughkeepsie Look!
They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
That paper is two weeks old.
Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?
I really wanted to take Kathy to this.
At least you have somebody to miss stuff with.
I hate being alone this time of year.
Next it's Valentine's Day then my birthday, then bang!
Before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
I want somebody!
You know, I want a man!
It doesn't even have to be a big relationship.
Just a fling!
I didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.
I no longer go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay.
No accountants.
And no one from "legal".
I don't like boring jobs.
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?
What's wrong, Mon?
Everybody at work still hates me.
Is it because of the review you wrote or something new?
It's the review.
I was making headway.
Everyone was smiling at me, and then I get off work and find out they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Maybe they meant to write "Quiet, Bitch".
What's the matter?
Fine!
Just trying to be nice.
I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.
And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.
But I've waited for this my whole life.
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them.
Or fire them!
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.
You know what you can do?
I read about this director, Orson Welles who, at the beginning, would hire somebody just to fire them.
Then they would all know who was boss.
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
All right.
You're hired!
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?
Yes.
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?
I'm not asking for me.
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.
I'm not gay.
I didn't think you were gay.
I do now.
My friend, Rachel, wants to be set up.
I just got out of a big relationship.
I'm not looking to get serious.
That's okay.
A fling might be all right with her.
Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party?
By the way, that is her full name.
Wow!
I'm free for her.
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.
Let's talk it over at the Ranger game.
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.
I'll bring them by your office at five.
That's a little later than I usually stay, but sure.
Before the game, we could enjoy some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.
I don't know what that is, but that's a pretty nice jacket.
Kind of like that tie too.
Keep your pants on, man.
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?
Happy Hanukkah, Monica May your Christmas be snowy, Joey Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross Spin the dreidel, Rachel Pheebs, that's great!
But you know, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel: Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
Maypole.
All good.
Thanks.
Do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad used to call you "Pumpkin"?
Pumpkin?
But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
Hello, children.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
-Really?
-I showed them your picture.
Guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff.
-Knicks tonight?
-Where are the seats?
Wherever!
I've got 20.
Will I like any of these guys?
You know, I'm going to play the field a little bit more.
Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
You work with robots?
Yes.
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.
I like swimmers' bodies.
His dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards.
I like credit cards!
I'm not bad at this!
-What does he do?
-He works in fine foods.
-You have a fine foods division?
-It's a big company.
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?
No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm going to work.
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah, lady.
I do!
I got a problem!
I'll give you a problem!
What will you do?
Fire me?
You bet your ass I'll fire you!
-See you later.
-Thanks.
I should go.
I've got a date.
With who?
You know the girl who lives in Poughkeepsie?
Not her.
This is someone else.
I can't decide between the two.
The one from Poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty really smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, she lives right uptown.
She's just as pretty.
I guess she's smart.
She's not fun.
If she's no fun, why date her at all?
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.
And, at the end of the date, she said something that if she was kidding, was very funny.
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.
How was your first day at the restaurant?
Damn!
What happened to your fancy jacket?
They baked it.
I can't take this anymore.
-I'm going to fire you tonight.
-You got it.
What are you doing?
You're still on fire there.
I think you got it!
Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
Like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
This could, maybe, get serious.
I thought you weren't looking for serious.
Just a fling?
Well, you know, possibly.
You didn't tell him that, though, right?
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
-You don't tell him that!
-Why not?
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl I see.
You telling him I want a fling and me putting out he's so going to get the wrong idea!
Joey, could you pass the cheese?
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
I thought it might be fun to try out a cool nickname.
Hey, Dragon!
Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's $300 in this one.
People get generous around the holidays.
And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Could the waiters listen to the specials?
There's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish Why is nobody writing these?
We can remember them.
Because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them?
Sure, that too.
Forget the specials for a minute.
Here's the thing.
For the last two weeks I have tried hard to create a positive atmosphere.
Can't hear you!
Positive atmosphere.
But I've had it up to here.
From now on, it is going to be my way or the highway.
All right?
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Hey, new guy.
I said, does anybody have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
He has a name.
It's Dragon.
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.
We did the hat, right?
-What the hell just happened?
-I am so sorry.
I was going to do it.
But I was standing there with $327 in one hand and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking it's been a long time since I had $327 plus $238!
We had a deal!
It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!
And I got to pay rent!
How about you don't fire me.
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.
They'll listen to the nice things I say about you.
What nice things?
Nothing yet.
They hate you, and I want to fit in.
Happy Hannukah, Chandler and Monica Merry, merry You know what, Pheebs?
I'm not Jewish so.
Ross doesn't decorate his tree with floss but he's not complaining.
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
What was Phoebe's song about?
It's the one with the cat.
I got to go.
I've got another date.
Did you pick one yet?
It turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.
So I'm still torn.
You don't like the one from uptown.
And you're exhausted from dating Poughkeepsie.
Just end them both!
Go to Poughkeepsie and break up with her.
Then break up with uptown.
By the time you get home, you're done!
You're right.
Thank you.
I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
-Prague?
-So much you don't know.
Patrick just ended things with me.
Did you or didn't you tell him I wanted a serious relationship?
I did!
I absolutely did!
You idiot!
I'm sure you're right.
But why?
You don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.
Now you scared him away!
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.
You should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know, I know!
Now I'm right back where I started.
This sucks!
Being alone sucks!
You'll meet somebody.
You're a great catch!
When I told those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really?
You graduated magna cum laude, right?
It doesn't matter.
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts?
Sure.
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.
Okay.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What?
What is the matter with you?
There is no good time to ask that question.
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!
Ross?
Ross?
Wake up!
I need more swordfish.
-Can you get me more swordfish?
-I don't speak English.
-You just did.
-I don't know what to tell you.
Fine.
Okay.
Very funny.
Let me out, please.
Come on, I'm cold!
And covered in marinara sauce!
Let me out!
You found that handle, did you?
-It's not funny.
-Well, that's not true.
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.
And I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me!
If you want me to quit this bad then Chef Geller?
You know that speech you made?
I got a problem with it!
-You do?
-You bet I do!
I just wasn't listening then, that's all.
If you want a problem, I'll give you a problem!
What are you going to do?
Fire me?
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!
Get out!
All right.
Anybody else got a problem?
How about you, chuckles?
You think this is funny now?
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?
No, it's really good.
Take those salads to table four.
And you, get the swordfish!
And you!
Get a haircut!
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!
What?
I bet myself that you had beautiful eyes.
Now that I see them, I win!
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes, we are.
So coffee?
Coffee sounds great.
Wait.
So you live in Montreal?
No, but it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
I should have thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to Chef Geller.
It will be a lean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Enough!
Lean, lean, lean!
So this is a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.
Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap Asked him to bring my friends All kinds of crap Said all you need is To write them a song Now you haven't heard it yet So don't try to sing along No, don't sing along Monica, Monica Have a happy Hannukah Saw Santa Claus He said hello to Ross And please tell Joey Christmas will be snowy And Rachel and Chandler Happy holidays, everybody!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I can't believe my little brother's married!
Why didn't you tell me you were eloping?
Well, we were at court, eating lunch Why were you at the courthouse?
We were having lunch.
We were like we're here, we're having lunch.
Let's get married!
Right?
A year ago, I didn't know I had a brother.
Now I have a sister!
Oh, it's so great.
Okay.
Okay.
Stop it!
Don't!
I'll get you a gift now.
Is there anything you need?
We've been trying to get pregnant since we got engaged, to get a jump on things.
No one's getting any younger.
Because the thing is, we're not able to, you know, conceive.
We've seen a bunch of doctors.
They say that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg, put it together in a dish and put it into another girl.
We were wondering if you could be that girl.
That's a really nice gift.
I was thinking of a gravy boat.
We know it's a lot to ask.
We don't have anyone else to go to.
We could pay someone but we don't have that kind of money.
Plus, you know, you're family and, you know I just don't want my baby to grow into some chick I don't know, you know?
Don't give us an answer yet, think about it.
And if you say no, we'll totally understand.
Okay.
Okay.
And we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station.
Well, actually, we kind of need an answer to that one right now.
The One with Phoebe's Uterus Check it out!
Guess what job I just got.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
Blue blazer back.
He wants it back.
You said "black".
Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you know what I meant.
You messed it up.
You're stupid.
So, what job did you get?
Tour guide at the museum.
Ross got it for me.
Don't you have to be a dinosaur expert?
They give you all the information.
It's like memorizing a script.
On your left you have a tyrannosaurus rex, from the Jurassic Period.
Very nice.
Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.
But I can pronounce Jurassic.
Frank Jr. and Alice got married!
Oh, my God!
They're having a baby!
They want me to grow it for them in my uterus!
-My God!
-Are you serious?
You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
Ew!
And, oh, no!
They want me to be the surrogate.
It's her egg and his sperm.
I'm the oven.
It's their bun.
What did you say?
I had to think about it first, but what is there to think of?
I'll be giving someone the greatest gift.
You'll carry their child and get them a Sony PlayStation?
This is an incredible thing to do.
But there are things to think about.
Yeah, you'd be pregnant.
I mean, pregnant.
I know.
You'll put your body through an awful lot.
I mean, morning sickness, labor.
It's all for somebody else.
Yeah.
What's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
I couldn't do that.
I always figured the first time I had a baby, it'd be with someone I love.
And that baby was, you know a keeper.
You were more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
If you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
Just think it through.
Talk to somebody who's had a baby.
Like your mom.
My mom never gave birth.
Oh!
But my birth mom did!
I love this tushy!
Can I take it to work with me?
Yeah, sure.
It's not mine anyway.
It came with the pants.
I am so jealous.
You guys are just right there.
Yes.
Right where?
The beginning, where it's all sex and talking and sex and talking.
You got to love the talking.
-And the sex?
-We haven't had sex.
What's the big deal?
This is special.
I want our love to grow before moving to the next level.
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
That is really nice Iying!
-No way is that the reason.
-Why?
Because you're not mature enough to understand that?
He's right.
I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
-I was going for the metaphor.
-I was saying the actual words.
He's had a lot of girlfriends.
Doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall.
Either he's great, or she liked to agree with him a lot.
Loudly and a lot.
All night long she'd agree.
It'll be different.
The sex will be great because you're in love.
-Just go for it.
-Yeah, you should.
All right.
I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Now, the mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic Period.
Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch?
This is a museum.
No talking.
Right down here we have a large foot.
And over here we have Ross Geller.
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
Ross is one of our scientists.
Look at him hard at work.
Okay, moving right along.
Come on.
It's open.
Come in.
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-That's okay.
I had time to finish glazing my nipples.
You go all out when you're expecting company.
I was working on my pottery.
Oh!
I didn't know that you did pot.
Mostly nudes.
It combines my two passions: pottery and erotica.
Erottery!
Thanks for coming out to see me.
I thought it'd be a good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.
I don't think it's a good idea.
Why not?
You'd be giving up a baby.
And I really don't I don't know if anything I said would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
No, no, I understand the pain.
Don't hurt the puppy!
No, no.
The puppy is yours.
-I get a puppy?
-But for only three days.
Why?
I realize I don't have any right to start getting parent-y on you now.
Look at me and not the puppy.
It's very important.
I know what I'm talking about.
I gave up two babies.
I only wish I had someone who'd given up babies that told me how terrible it is.
I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
That's okay.
No, we're listening.
It'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.
So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.
Okay, fair enough.
Three days.
Oh, it's time to take my ass out of the kiln.
Could you sit there?
I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor?
I didn't know he had a nickname.
Oh, he won't sit here.
Only people in white coats sit there.
Only people in blue blazers sit here.
-How come?
-That's just the way it is.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: a world without lab coats and blazers.
But you not in a perfect world.
You in a museum now.
See that scientist?
He and I used to play together in grade school, but now.
Peter!
Hey, Peter!
It's me!
Rhonda, from P.S. 129?
I shared my pudding with you, man!
I gave you my Snack Pack!
See?
He pretend he don't even hear me!
Everyone's pretending they don't hear you.
I don't know about your jackets and separate tables but Ross is my friend.
And if I save him a seat, he will sit in it.
Here!
I saved you a seat!
I'm cool here.
I'll catch up with you later.
This is saved.
Gift shop.
I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
You do what you got to do.
The scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere.
Mon, back me up.
Where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters.
And the chefs eat with the other chefs?
I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.
Okay, Rach, when was the last time you had lunch with the shipping clerks?
I've never had lunch with the shipping clerks but it's totally different.
They're not allowed in the executive cafeteria.
Oh, I see what you're saying.
Look, Ross.
It's no big deal.
You wear a white coat.
I wear a blue blazer.
If that means we can't be friends at work, so be it.
I understand, you know?
When I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you.
So it's, you know, it's cool.
I'll see you tomorrow.
When we're in the audience, he doesn't talk but he does wave.
Who's my puppy?
Who's my puppy?
Who's my puppy?
-Have you named him yet?
-No, I don't want to get attached.
-Can I hold him?
-Sure.
Here.
-Come here, squirmy.
Hello -Not like that.
No.
Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
I think it's time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, let's go to the balcony.
The street.
Come on, let's go to the street.
Don't go on the balcony until after I get back.
So did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
It was bad?
It was fine, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as with Joey.
She was like, "l see your point.
I'm all right with it".
There's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah.
Not for girls, anyway.
Guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me.
I mean.
I know what to do with a woman.
It's always nice.
I need to know what makes it go from nice to: "My God!
Somebody's killing her in there"!
I'll show you something a lot of guys don't know.
All right.
Now.
You don't have to draw an actual Whoa, she's hot!
Everyone knows the erogenous zones.
You got one, two, three four five, six and seven.
There are seven?
Let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
That's one?
Kind of an important one.
I was looking at it upside down.
Well, you know, sometimes that helps.
Most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.
That's bad?
At Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.
You might if it were like seven.
All right, the important thing is to take your time.
You want to hit them all mix them up.
Keep them on their toes.
Oh, toes!
For some people.
All right.
You could start out with a little one.
A two.
A one, two, three.
A three.
A five.
A four.
A three, two.
Two.
A two, four, six.
Two, four, six.
Four.
Two.
Two.
Four, seven!
Five, seven!
Six, seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
Seven!
And there you are.
Yeah, that'll work.
Dr. Geller?
There's a seat here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
But I'm having my lunch at this table.
Here in the middle.
I'm having my lunch right here with my good friend, Joey.
If he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
You know we work in a museum of natural history.
And yet, there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch.
Now, I want you to know it took a tour guide to show this scientist the error of his ways.
You might even say he took me on a tour of myself.
Yeah, that was me.
I look around, and you know what I see?
I see division.
Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.
I ask myself, "My God, why"?
Now, I say we shed these coats that separate us.
And we get to know the people underneath.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a kid!
I'm Joey!
I'm an actor!
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here, and New York really scares me.
-There you go!
-Hang in there, Teddy!
I'm Andrew.
And I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay.
Good for you.
I'm Rhonda!
And these aren't real!
Wow, Rhonda.
-I'm Scott.
-Yeah, okay, Scott!
I flip the light switch on and off or my family will die.
My mom's gonna be here any minute.
I can't.
I can't give him up.
Yes, no.
I can.
I don't want to.
But I can.
No.
I can't watch this.
It's like Sophie's Choice.
You know, I never saw that.
Oh, it was only okay.
I can't do this.
My mom was right.
If I can't give him up there's no way I can give up a baby.
Frank and Alice are going to be so crushed.
What else can I give them?
A kidney!
We were in the neighborhood.
We want to let you know that there's still no pressure.
If there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.
Who's this little guy?
He's so cute!
He reminds me of my old dog, Tumor.
You are so precious, I could take you home.
Why don't you?
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.
Thanks.
-What are you doing?
-I'm okay with this.
You know why?
Because look at them.
Look how happy they are.
And I made that, so you know.
It'll be a million times harder to give up a baby, but oh, my God!
It'll feel a million times better, right?
I'll do this.
I want to carry your baby.
Thank you so much!
You don't know what this means to us.
I think I'm going to cry!
It's going to be so great.
-What's going on?
-I gave them the puppy.
It made them so happy, I decided to carry their baby.
-Phoebe -No, I know.
We're different, though.
This is a different situation.
I am not going to regret this.
I understand all that.
It's just, that was my puppy.
Would you ever be a surrogate?
Depends who asked.
What if I asked?
Oh, Mon, sure!
-Really?
-Yes.
You're not asking me, are you?
-No.
-Yes.
Totally.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Yes, thank you!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
What the hell is that?
!
What the hell is that?
Is that you?
-You're really not a morning person.
-Just back off!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
What is that noise?
You!
It's the chick.
She's going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
The vet seems to think she's becoming a rooster.
We're getting a second opinion.
The One With the Embryos Why are you shopping at 8 in the morning?
I've been up since 6 thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
You should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.
Especially not with these knives and cookbooks around.
I'm going to the doctor and see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
How will they know?
They'll just see if my endometrial layer is thick.
I can check that for you.
Okay, think "thick".
Good luck!
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
-I'm still right.
-That is so not true.
What?
I know it's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old-lady underpants.
I can check that for you.
You two think you know me and Rachel better than we know you.
Well, we do.
You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.
What's that about?
And you!
Ross, if you check Rachel's bag you'll find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
You're good.
These are not.
I'm so not impressed.
Everybody snacks when they shop.
Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five.
Okay, 10 bucks says we can name every item in that bag.
-How many guesses?
-Six.
Challenge extended.
-Deal!
-Challenge accepted.
All right, we'll start with apples.
We'll be starting with apples.
Stop that now.
Yes.
Okay.
Tortilla chips.
-Yogurt.
-Diet soda.
-Orange juice.
-There's no orange juice!
We win!
They have another guess.
Well, we won that one.
Okay.
The last thing is Not for another two weeks.
I got it.
Scotch tape.
How did you know she would buy Scotch tape?
We used up theirs last night making scary faces.
Oh, man!
All right!
Ten bucks.
Fork it over.
Cough it up.
Pay the piper.
Give me it!
You don't know us better.
I want a rematch.
And no stupid grocery questions.
Real, personal questions.
And the winner gets $100.
-Serious?
-Are you scared?
No.
Who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
Sure, Ross will do it.
It's not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own.
-Fine.
We'll ask Phoebe.
-No, I want to play.
Looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
I knew it!
I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, so what's now?
Go get the eggs.
Put them in there.
It'll take a little while to prepare the embryos.
-Embryos?
As in more than one?
-Five, actually.
Where am I giving birth in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Doing five gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
That's it?
25%?
That means that it's, like, I was thinking, what are the odds if you stuff 200 of them in there?
Sweetie, now she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Don't worry.
I'll do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
The thing is, we kind of only have one shot.
It costs $16,000 each time you do this.
Sixteen thousand dollars?
!
Well, it's 20 in California.
We're kind of using all the money we have to do it this one time.
Okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.
Maybe there's something I can do to make sure I get pregnant.
No, I'm sorry.
Wow, you guys really don't know anything.
Why don't you get drunk?
It worked for a bunch of girls in my high school.
-So how's the test coming?
-Hey, you're touching the game board.
Sorry.
You freak.
Do you realize that any minute now Phoebe could be pregnant?
I know, I know.
It's such a huge, life-altering thing.
The test is ready.
Okay.
Each team will answer 10 questions.
The first team to answer the most questions wins.
The categories are "Fears and Pet Peeves" "Ancient History" "Literature" and "It's all Relative".
Now the coin toss, to see who goes first.
Okay.
Somebody call it this time.
Tails!
It's heads.
Gentlemen, pick your category.
"Fears and Pet Peeves".
"What is Monica's biggest pet peeve"?
-Animals dressed as humans.
-Correct.
-Ladies?
-Same category.
"According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejesus out of him"?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!
That is correct.
The lrish jig guy?
His legs flail about as if independent from his body!
Gentlemen, your pick.
"It's all Relative".
"Monica and I had a grandmother who died.
You both went to her funeral.
Name that grandmother".
-Nana?
-She has a real name.
Althea!
-What?
-I took a shot!
With Althea?
-Althea is correct.
-Nice shooting!
"Literature".
"Every week the TV Guide comes to Chandler and Joey's apartment.
What name appears on the address label"?
Chandler gets it!
It's Chandler Bing!
I'm afraid the TV Guide comes to "Chanandler Bong".
I knew that!
Rachel, use your head!
Actually, it's Ms. Chanandler Bong.
Hello, teeny embryos.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.
Hi!
I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
We're doing this for Frank and Alice who you know.
You've been there.
They want you so much.
So when you guys get in there, really grab on.
And I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm until you're ready to have them take you home.
Next time you see me, if I'm screaming, don't worry.
That's what's supposed to happen.
Ready?
Good luck!
The score is nine to eight in favor of the guys.
Ladies, if you miss this, the game is theirs.
Pick a category.
"It's all Relative"!
-You don't have to shout everything.
-I'm sorry!
"What is the name of Chandler's father's Las Vegas all-male burlesque"?
Viva Las Gaygas!
Unfortunately, that is correct.
All right.
We have a tie.
Luckily, I've prepared for such an event.
The lightning round!
Thirty seconds.
All the questions you can answer.
You guys are dead!
I am so good at lightning rounds!
I majored in lightning rounds, all right?
We'll destroy you.
Want to bet?
I'm so confused as to what we've been doing so far.
How about we play for more money?
Say 150?
One hundred and fifty dollars.
Say 200?
Two hundred dollars!
You're doing it again.
Excuse me.
-I don't want to lose $200.
-We won't.
Three hundred?
I'm spicing it up!
So play for some pepper!
Stop spending my money.
I got it!
If we win, they have to get rid of the rooster.
That's interesting!
-No way!
That rooster's family.
-The duck too!
The duck doesn't make noise!
He gets the other one all riled up!
-We are not -All right, hold on!
If you win we give up the bird.
But if we win we get your apartment.
-Deal!
-What?
That's crazy.
There's no way we are betting the apartment.
All right, I'm in.
Because either he goes, or I'm buying a coyote.
Betting the apartment?
I don't know about this.
I have not missed one question the whole game.
I own this game!
-Look at my hand.
-You have the answers written there?
No.
Steady as a rock.
Now, are you with me?
All right, let's do it!
All right.
Gentlemen, you're up first.
You have 30 seconds.
The lightning round begins Stop it!
"Monica's nickname when she was a hockey goalie"?
-Big Fat Goalie.
-Correct!
"Rachel claims it's her favorite movie".
Dangerous Liaisons.
-"Her actual favorite is"?
-Weekend at Bernie's.
"In what part of her body did Monica get a pencil stuck at age 14"?
No!
Her ear!
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there"?
-Everyday use.
-Fancy.
-Guest.
-Fancy guest.
-Two seconds.
-Eleven?
Unbelievable!
Eleven is correct!
All right.
That's four for the guys.
Ladies, you're up!
Thirty seconds on the clock.
Five correct questions wins the game.
The lightning round begins now.
"Joey's favorite food"?
-Sandwiches!
-Correct.
"Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl's breast"?
-14?
-No, 19.
Thanks, man.
"Joey had an imaginary childhood friend.
-His name was"?
-Maurice!
-"His profession was"?
-Space cowboy!
"What is Chandler Bing's job"?
It has something to do with numbers!
-And processing!
-He carries a briefcase.
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.
Something to do with transponding.
He's a transponster!
That's not even a word!
I can get this!
I can get this!
-I call Monica's room.
-You can't just call Monica's room.
Sure I can.
Standard shotgun rules.
I'm in sight of the room and I called it.
Damn!
I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Guess the color of my tonsils.
I bet the apartment!
I would never bet this place.
It's too nice.
Are they in there?
Yeah, I'm implanted.
-How do you feel?
-Well, freaked.
It turns out the odds are really sucky.
And this is Frank and Alice's only shot.
They are literally putting all their eggs in my basket.
But I bet it works.
Really?
How much?
I'm going to take a pregnancy test now.
Wow!
You can tell this soon?
The doctor says it takes a few days.
But my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine.
I can't believe you guys think you're moving in here.
Well, believe it, baby!
-Well, I'm not moving.
-What?
No.
It was a stupid bet.
We were just playing a game.
You can't ignore the bet.
It's a bet!
Bet on a bet and if you lose, you lose the bet.
We have to move.
We would have made them get rid of the birds.
I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better this is all your fault.
What?
Chanandler Bong!
We steal that TV Guide every week!
I knew it!
I don't care.
I'm not going anywhere.
Cool!
Girl roommate.
Well?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
It's only been a couple hours.
Meanwhile, I'll do whatever I can to help this.
I'm just going to, you know, lie in your chair, okay?
Good.
I'm going to let gravity do its job.
I won't get in the way.
It'll be just like that time I tried to count all the bumps on your ceiling.
You know, Pheebs, if you sit there long enough, you'll be sitting in our apartment.
I can't believe this.
Oh, Rach, FYl: Your new apartment hasn't had hot water since Christmas.
Can you give me a hand?
Put that box down!
We are not going anywhere!
This is my apartment and I like it!
This is a girl's apartment!
That is a boy's apartment!
It's dirty and it smells!
This is pretty!
It's so pretty!
And look, it's purple!
I tell you, you with your steady hand, I am not moving.
And now I have got the steady hand.
Okay, okay.
-I'll take care of it.
-That's right.
You do what the hand says!
-How'd it go?
-I lost our mattresses.
Are you in there, little fetus?
In nine months will you come greet us?
I will buy you some Adidas We were just at the drugstore so we got you a little present.
That's where all my blood was.
It's a lollipop and a home pregnancy test.
Don't mix those up.
You could really ruin that lollipop.
You feel like taking a test?
There's only one question.
All right.
I will.
Remember that it's still really early.
If it says I'm not pregnant, that doesn't mean I won't get pregnant.
Just so I don't go completely nuts try not to put all your hopes on this.
Great.
You are mean boys who are just being mean!
Don't get mad!
No one forced you to raise the stakes.
That is not true!
She forced me!
You got the question wrong.
It was a stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.
-Stop calling it your apartment!
-lt is!
You're going to have a baby.
They're going to have a baby!
My sister's going to have my baby!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
I can't find garbage bags.
I think I saw some in here.
What is it?
I don't know.
But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
I can't believe we're living here!
What is it?
Did you see the size of the closets?
I can't believe we live here!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
She is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.
I get to have sex with the star of the play!
-People can hear you.
-I know!
She looks great, doesn't she?
That is one good-looking man.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?
So you been doing this long?
No.
You're my first.
Put the money on the table.
That's nice.
Dude!
-ls that an expensive blouse?
-lf you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
The One with Rachel's Crush Do you still have your old blouses and dresses from high school?
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere.
Why?
Maternity clothes are so expensive.
Rach, I made a pile of your stuff.
If you could just throw your purses at it.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Are you out of a job?
No, but they stuck me in Personal Shopping, which is a huge step down.
What is that?
Where you walk around with rich people and tell them what to buy?
That sounds great!
We switched apartments.
You can't eat our food.
That gravy train has ended.
There's gravy?
If you have the big apartment, you have to deal with people coming over.
That fridge has to be stocked.
That's your apartment now.
-What are you doing?
-I think I left a doughnut up here.
How was Kathy's play?
Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good-looking guy.
It's like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it.
That's a good idea for a business.
I'm totally screwed.
They're gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night then they'll go to their cast parties, and he's gonna try to undermine me.
He'll be like, "Where's your boyfriend?
What's his name?
Chester"?
She'll go, "It's Chandler".
He'll go, "Whatever"!
That is a good trick.
All right, look.
What am I going to do?
They're actors.
They're there to do a job.
It doesn't mean they're gonna get together.
Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They're not a couple.
I get the game now.
All these people were in movies together.
It's much different with plays.
You were in acting class together, and she slept with you.
Acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play.
When they were doing it on stage, was it really hot?
Oh, yeah.
So you're fine.
The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
As long as it's hot on stage, you got nothing to worry about.
When the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Really?
You guys have been to every play I've been in.
Have I ever had chemistry on stage?
-No.
-No!
Are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?
I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between them.
-I know, but -No, I'm there.
-Want some pancakes?
-You made pancakes?
Grab a plate.
No, no.
Stay right there.
Getting closer.
Don't worry we also have cereals, muffins, waffles and jams, jellies and marmalades, which I'm sure are the same thing.
Please eat, because Joey opened everything.
We're watching the game here Saturday night, if people wanna come over.
I was thinking about having people over.
Yeah?
Who's playing?
The players.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Please.
It's a relief, is what it is, is what it is.
Pheebs, stick out your plate.
Monica, I'm quitting.
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
I'm quitting.
I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.
Mr. Waltham?
I really need to talk to you.
In a moment, please.
I'm in the middle of a task.
And you have a customer.
Hi.
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm Rachel Greene.
What could I do for you, Joshua?
I need a whole new wardrobe.
My wife Well, my ex-wife I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
I got away with this suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
It wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
I need everything down to underwear.
If you're willing, I'm all yours.
Okay.
You needed to speak to me?
No, no, that wasn't me.
We should get started.
Let me show you my underwear.
The selection of underwear that we carry.
I'm sorry.
-It's this way.
-This way?
Sorry.
I'm right.
Right?
There was no chemistry between them.
Before, they had heat.
Now, there's no heat.
You know what this means.
Joey told us what this means.
Let's not jump to any conclusions.
There was some sexual chemistry.
Come on.
It was like cousins having sex.
Here she comes.
Don't say a word.
Just be cool.
Don't be, you know, you.
Hey, you guys!
Thank you so much for coming again.
-Did you like it tonight?
-Absolutely.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
It's a good play, isn't it?
I loved the play.
You were great.
And Nick, ditto.
Clearly, you're having sex with him.
Okay.
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
It was so obvious.
There was no chemistry between you two.
You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
I can see how this could happen.
You're up there every night naked, touching, kissing.
Acting.
Chandler, this is my job.
I'm playing a part in a play.
How can you not trust me?
You can understand, given how we started.
I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
That is what happened.
I don't even see you denying this.
I'll tell you what, Chandler.
You call me when you grow up.
Don't expect that to happen any time soon!
I have the best job in the entire world!
The most adorable guy came over, and I got to dress him up all day!
Rachel has a new doll!
I wish he was a doll.
I'd get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissing noises.
He's got the most beautiful name.
I never realized.
Joshua.
Joshua.
Joshua.
Josh.
Hello?
Hi.
What do I smell?
I don't know.
It smells good.
Fresh cookies!
Hot from the oven.
Please, have some.
I've been fiddling around here, making delicious treats for everyone.
The new Playboy.
Just something I picked up.
Cookies and porn?
You're the best mom ever!
What?
It's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.
How does Jason look in a V-neck?
-It's Joshua.
-Whatever.
Wait.
Wait.
This isn't takeout!
-Hate to eat and run.
-No, wait.
Please, don't go!
I've got porn for you too.
I don't need it.
People are supposed to want to hang out here.
Why?
What is the big deal?
I'm the hostess.
Not those guys.
I'm always the hostess.
Even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.
I served the best air.
Why'd you make a big thing out of everyone hanging out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.
I'm done now.
They've suffered enough.
If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.
That is true.
This place is gonna be 10 times better than that place.
Are we gonna trash their place?
There's steps!
Slut!
You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
-What?
-You were right?
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.
I don't live here!
Wait, are you sure?
I may be drunk, but I know what she said.
Then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's.
-Beefsteak Charlie's?
-Yes!
You and l have always been like: Man, I am so sorry.
The bartender taught me a trick, though.
I don't remember it.
-Do you need help with that?
-I got it.
I just feel bad.
I never vacuum.
I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
-Just so frustrating.
-Why don't you ask him out?
Totally.
That's such a turn-on.
Really?
It doesn't seem desperate?
That's the turn-on.
He just got a divorce.
Right?
He's probably really nervous around women.
Maybe you just need to make the first move.
-I've never asked a guy out before.
-You've never asked a guy out?
No.
Have you?
Thousands of times!
That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
What I do is, I look a woman up and down, and I say "Hey.
How you doing"?
Oh, please!
Hey.
How you doing?
You know what?
I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna call him up and ask him out.
I can do that, ask him out.
"How you doing"?
Hi, Joshua.
It's Rachel Greene from Bloomingdale's.
I was just wondering if you?
If you Ieft your wallet at the store today?
We found a wallet, and we The license?
That is a good idea.
Well, let's see.
This license belongs to belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
So sorry to bother you at home.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye.
-You've done that a thousand times?
-I've never done that.
I just got so nervous that he'd say no.
You gotta give him something he can't say no to, like Knicks tickets.
Invite him to a Knicks game.
You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
-Really?
You think that'll work?
-Absolutely.
And if not, can I go?
What the heck is that?
Did she call?
No.
Sorry.
Maybe I should call her.
Forget her, man.
You don't need her.
He's right.
What she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but, you know, what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
What if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Tell me she told you this.
She didn't have to tell me.
I saw the play.
There was no heat.
-Back me up.
-That's all you're basing this on?
That's not backing me up!
Look, you said, "With the offstage and the heat" That was just a theory.
There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out: Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
Oh, my God!
"Would you like to go to a basketball game with"?
"It's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets" "Who likes the Knick"?
What do you think?
Well, as a single woman, who is available I think you look great.
Oh, yeah.
You look great.
This looks great.
So you like it?
I do.
I love it.
In fact, I think I'll wear it home.
-Great.
-Thank you so much for all your help.
Well, I guess this is it.
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you in the spring for the bathing suits.
You don't want to do that now?
That's okay.
I'll see you around sometime.
Basketball!
Sorry?
I have two tickets to the Knicks game if you're interested just as a thank-you for this week.
That would be great!
-Really?
-That would be fantastic!
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks!
This is fantastic.
Thank you so much, Rachel.
Good morning.
I just wanted to come over to say that I'm sorry.
I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
I can completely understand why you were so upset.
I really wish you'd called me.
Yeah, I know.
I wish I had too.
I think this is a good thing.
We've had our first fight, and now we can move on.
I know for me, but Nick's pants?
I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
-For next time, what do you say?
-"l have an extra ticket".
"An extra ticket".
Not "two tickets".
The first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
He didn't turn me down.
He's at the game.
I got the date.
I'm just not on it.
Okay, it's ready.
-Come on.
-What's ready?
Just come.
Oh, my God!
This is beautiful!
Did you work for two days straight?
Pretty much.
What do you think of the floor?
I don't know.
Looks the same.
You used to have carpet.
Oh, yeah.
I made snacks.
Please, just hang out.
I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.
Do you want us to come back later?
No, no, no.
Stay.
Just keep talking.
I'm always the hostess.
How'd it go?
-She wasn't sleeping with him.
-Good!
She is now.
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
You think you know a person, then they turn around and sleep with Nick.
Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.
I hate him.
And I hate her.
I don't hate her.
I love her.
This is all my fault.
How?
How is it your fault?
I should have called.
If I had called her, she never would have gone out with Nick.
They wouldn't have ended up in bed.
I threw her at his man-nipples!
This is not your fault.
Your fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if she thought they were on a break.
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold, a Joshua Burgen.
Really?
-Will you call him?
-Yes, I will.
Absolutely.
Hello, Rachel.
Hi, Joshua.
-I left my wallet here on purpose.
-Really?
Yes.
I just wanted to see you again.
I'm glad.
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.
Yes?
"How you doing"?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
So, what is this?
Googlie Worm.
And this?
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.
It's so funny!
What's this?
A hunk of sandwich from last year.
Geller's got one hooked!
Looks like a big one!
It's the classic struggle between man Someone knocked over a lamp.
You know what'll be great about the fishing trip?
When my Dad asks, "What are you doing with your life"?
I can say, "I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston.
What about you"?
Don't stop having fun just because I'm here.
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
Well, except you.
You know what is so sweet?
Those birds have not left his side the whole time.
Yeah, I wish that rooster were dead.
You shouldn't leave Chandler alone.
They broke up only two days ago.
Go fishing next week.
There's nothing I can do.
He's still in his sweats.
That's only phase one.
I'll be back for phase two.
I'd never miss that.
Phase two?
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.
How does going there make him better?
There are naked ladies there.
Then to phase three: seeing yourself with other women.
There are naked ladies there too.
Would you give me one minute, please?
The One with Joey's Dirty Day These will match the jacket you picked out last week?
There we go.
There it is.
You know what I need?
Gloves.
Brown leather dress gloves.
Well, let's see.
This one is large.
And this one.
Also large?
Two larges coming right up.
Hello.
-Damn you.
-Could I have a moment?
My niece, you see, is in town from London.
Shropshire, but you know.
She's about your age, I'd say.
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.
Would you like to keep her company tonight?
Sure.
You got it!
Count me in.
Me.
Fledermaus.
Great!
Yes, of course.
Thank you so very much.
So?
-Gloves?
-Sorry, I'll be right back.
Actually, I got to take off.
I was curious.
Do you have plans tonight?
No, nothing!
I invested in a nightclub.
It opens tonight.
Want to come?
That would be great!
You're into hard-core S & M, right?
-Well, I guess.
-I'm kidding.
I'll put you on the VlP list.
Look for me.
Great!
You bet.
I'll see you tonight.
-I almost forgot the tickets.
-What?
For you and Emily.
Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.
Oh, right.
You'll like it.
It has two out of the three tenors.
I can't believe Kathy did this to me.
I really thought she was the one.
I'll tell you what.
I'm not getting out of this chair.
Ever!
From now on, this chair is the one!
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.
Just take the sweats off, okay?
Take them off and we'll have some fun.
Wow, and I can't resist that line.
That's why I never wear sweatpants.
Did you catch any fish?
You guys have no idea.
-You stink!
-Are you kidding?
Three days without a shower.
Plus, I fell in a big tub of worms!
How's he doing?
He hasn't left that chair in two days.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
You see?
He just needed his pal to come home.
I got to memorize my lines.
Me and Charlton Heston, bright and early tomorrow, baby!
What's the matter?
Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But I already told Mr. Waltham that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
So, what are you going to do?
-I don't know.
-No!
Help me!
-I can't.
I have to work.
-Phoebe?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
You guys, come on!
I have to meet Joshua.
It's my one chance for him to see the "fun" Rachel.
The "wouldn't it be great if she were my wife"?
Rachel.
Are Joey and Chandler back?
Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.
So.
No.
Come on!
-She's here.
-Wait, wait.
Ross, please?
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
That is a toughie.
She's looking down the hall.
She looked right at me.
You can't see people through that hole, can you?
I'll be right there!
Okay, Ross, please.
I thought we had moved on.
I thought we could be happy for each other.
I mean, was that just me?
All right, I'll do it.
Thank you, thank you.
Emily.
I'm Rachel Greene.
Thank goodness!
There's been a teeny change of plans.
I'm not free tonight Really?
I must've missed your call, though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Well, l That's not rude.
It's in keeping with the trip where I've been run down by one of your wiener carts and been strip-searched at the airport.
Apparently, I look like someone who's got cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I think you look great.
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you.
I'll get her.
Please, hurry.
Don't you just love the way they talk?
-What?
-The baby kicked!
Oh, my God.
No, wait.
The elastic in my underwear busted.
Oh, my God!
I overslept!
I was supposed to be on the set half an hour ago!
You can't go like that!
You stink!
I fell asleep.
Now I don't have time!
Just 10 blocks away.
If I run, I'll make it.
Run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.
Slow down!
No, keep moving.
How did it go last night?
Well, I didn't see Joshua.
But I did punch a girl in the face.
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring.
There was no Rachel Greene on the list.
But there was a Rachel Greep.
So did you get to meet her?
There is no Rachel Greep.
But this girl overheard us.
And she said, "I'm Rachel Greep"!
And he let her in.
So you hit her?
No, she was already in.
This big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella so I clocked her.
All I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua so he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Pheebs.
Honey, that's your name.
That's short for Phoebe?
I thought that's what we called each other.
-You're wearing pants!
-That's right.
Where are the guys?
I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.
It's 9:30 a.m. They got a breakfast buffet.
Let me talk to him!
-Oh, my God!
-Can't I just?
-It's my phone and she's shush -Please!
What's he saying?
He's with Emily in Vermont.
What?
Oh, my God!
Who the hell is Emily?
No.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet.
Who wouldn't be miserable?
I'm telling you, once l got her into a dry pair of shoes she was a totally different person.
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?
How'd he end up in Vermont with that witch?
Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.
There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard!
I got to go!
There's a deer eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go.
There was a deer eating fruit from the orchard.
I don't get this.
She was horrible!
I'm going to go stand over there.
Why do you care?
I don't care.
I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
You do not just meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
When you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Could you, just for once not remember every little thing?
So you know, when's he getting back?
A couple of days.
I knew something like this would happen.
What are you doing?
You can't go back a phase!
You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.
Why don't you do your phase two strip club thing with us?
We can be guys!
No, you can't.
Let us be guys!
Maybe we want to be guys.
No, you don't.
You'd be all hairy and wouldn't live as long.
Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?
And come with us and watch naked girls dance!
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm here.
Calm down, we got time.
We're running late.
All set.
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating licorice.
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?
You.
I could see why you would think that.
But you know who it is?
You?
No, no.
It's Heston.
What?
He reeks like he went on a three-day fishing trip, then ate licorice.
No way.
He's the only one with a shower in his dressing room.
Really?
A shower?
Which room might that be?
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
I got some ones.
You want to put them in her panties?
No, thanks, Mom!
That.
You have to put that out because I'm pregnant.
Maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
It's not my baby.
Very good.
Really good.
I enjoyed it.
Very exotic.
I just checked our messages and Joshua didn't call.
You'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up.
You know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.
Come on, look where you are!
Another round of daiquiris.
Virgin for me.
Don't let me leave without the name of that carpet guy.
Come on!
You know what?
I'll go home and call Kathy.
If it'll help.
That was a test.
In a few hours, I'll be drunk.
I'll want to call her.
You'll have to stop me.
Then I'll be so drunk, I'll want to call Janice.
You should!
How is she?
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Who's in there?
How you doing?
Who in the hell are you?
Would you believe me if I said I was Kirk Douglas?
Put some pants on, kid, so I can kick your butt.
No, wait.
You don't understand.
I'm an actor.
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.
And I stink!
You're in this picture?
I'm a cop who won't work with you because you're a loose cannon.
Anyway, I'm really sorry.
But I stink.
Joey, right?
Every actor, one time or another Every actor thinks he stinks.
Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.
Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
You don't understand.
Listen to me.
I don't know one actor worth his salt who, one time in his career, didn't say, "God, I stink"!
I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.
The important thing, and you must remember no matter how badly you think you stink you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower!
Do you understand me?
-Yes, sir.
I'm very sorry.
-Wait a minute!
Take your pants.
Sorry.
I'm really sorry.
What a business.
We did okay at the strip club, right?
Great.
Thanks to you, the hottest waitress is quitting to teach the third grade!
-He still hasn't called.
-Who, Josh?
It's Joshua.
-He doesn't like "Josh"?
-No, I don't.
I'm going to put my sweats back on.
You know what?
You were right.
We weren't great at being guys.
You know why?
Because we're girls.
-You know what girls are good at?
-Stripping!
No, listening!
Sit.
Maybe it would really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?
And you know, if you want to cry, that's okay too.
I'm going to have to ask you all to leave.
Forget it.
We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.
Those strippers were hot, and l couldn't picture myself with them.
They really were pretty, weren't they?
-I liked that fighter pilot one.
-Candy?
She was so spunky!
I think if I were going to be with a woman it'd be with someone like Michelle.
She was just so petite.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.
She had the smoothest skin.
I stuck that dollar in her G-string and grazed her thigh Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!
I am totally picturing you with all those women!
That's not phase three.
Well, I'm there too!
Are we all together in a group?
Stop it, you're killing me!
I think I moved on to phase four!
-What is that?
-I don't want a relationship ever!
I just want sex with strippers and my friends!
Come on.
Let me see that smile.
I don't want to.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club!
You'll have plenty of chances.
There are thousands of women out there, just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right.
How was Vermont?
Emily is incredible.
There are no words to describe her.
The whole weekend was like a dream.
And you!
Rach!
You were so right.
What?
What you said about us finally being in a place where we could really be happy for each other.
I admit, I wasn't quite there.
The thought of you and that Josh guy Joshua.
Joshua guy at that club, dancing, having a good time.
And the thought of it kind of.
You know?
But now!
But now, I'm totally there.
I'm finally where you are.
Thank goodness!
And thank you for Emily.
No problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?
I'm happy for you.
Happy for you.
Oh, no, happy for you.
All right.
Here's what we'll do.
You are going to take off my clothes.
You two, go get the oils.
And you, just constantly scream "Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king"!
I want to be with her.
I like her.
That's fine.
Go with your instincts!
What am I doing again?
Pay attention.
I could wake up at any moment.
I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.
That's not Joshua.
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.
I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.
What are you doing?
All right, listen.
I got to wake up.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I'm getting my nails done!
You said it was going to be fun.
Which it kind of is.
You said there would be guys.
There are no guys.
There's one right over there.
That's a mailman!
That's our mailman!
Hi, how are you.
Don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.
That does.
What am I sitting on?
What was this woman scratching when this broke off?
You know who had nails like that?
Oh my God!
The One with All the Rugby Joey, let me ask you a question.
What does this light switch do?
Nothing.
Did it drive you crazy to not know?
I know what it did.
Nothing.
They put it there for something.
How can you not care?
Like this.
Here's another question.
What does the silver knob on the toilet do?
It flushes it.
Since you know, when you come over, would you use it?
-Hello.
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.
Wow.
-Guess who we saw today?
-Janice!
-ls this amazing?
-How have you been?
-Well, I'm divorced.
Oh, wow.
I'm riding the alimony pony.
And there it is.
I just came up to say "hi".
Sweetie, I'll see you later.
I'll see you tonight.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.
I can't stand the woman!
What?
I thought you were crazy about her!
But you know all those annoying things she did before?
Her voice, her laugh and her personality?
They're all back!
And she's picked up, like, nine new ones!
Why'd you bring her here?
There's people here!
Don't worry.
I'm taking care of it.
You are not!
You never break up with her.
I don't have to break up.
We're not involved.
I'll do a preemptive strike.
I'll end it with her before it starts.
My ass is, like, frozen!
Try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
I'm telling you!
I can't believe you walk alone here at night.
-You hear such stories about New York.
-It's not that bad.
I mean, l, for one, feel perfectly safe.
Help!
Help!
No, no, Ross!
These are friends from home.
Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
-Hi, mate.
-How are you, man?
That was a good one, huh?
"Help!
Help"!
How are you?
I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but I've been rather busy.
We have not seen each other since that U2 concert.
Oh, my God.
You're right.
Actually, the last time we saw each other was the next morning.
Oh, Liam!
Oh, Liam.
So were you guys playing soccer?
Or should I call it "football"?
We were playing rugby.
In fact, we're playing tomorrow.
You're welcome to play.
Ross play rugby?
I don't think so.
What's so funny?
Well, you're American, to start with.
You don't have rugby here.
Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776 either, so.
So, good!
We'll see you at the park at two.
Cheers!
Oh, boy!
I just love to sing.
Yes, I know you do.
The reason people complained was because they paid to hear the actor sing "Old Man River".
Look at us!
Who would've thought Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails?
Okay, we have to talk.
I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.
I know.
And I'm just getting out of a marriage.
Talk about "meant to be".
Right.
But I think this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon!
Face it, I'm not letting you get away this time.
I hear you!
But unfortunately my company is transferring me overseas.
Oh, no!
Where to?
To Paris?
No, not Paris.
To London?
Rome?
Vienna?
Barcelona?
Could you just stop talking for a second?
Yemen.
That's right.
Yes!
I'm being transferred to Yemen!
When?
I don't know exactly.
Well, I will just have to soak up every ounce of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
-Done?
-Yep!
What's up?
This switch is driving me crazy.
I turned it off and checked every outlet.
Four don't work, which means one is controlled by the switch.
So I plugged things in the outlets that make noise.
That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise.
Bet I stopped listening first.
You know, you also could have used lamps and followed the light.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise.
So, everybody ready?
Here we go!
Something.
I hear something.
Where is it?
It's coming from Joey!
Oh, my God!
That's so freaky!
Turn him off!
Could we put on the news?
It might be raining.
Hold on.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
I'm man enough to play this sport!
You're not even man enough to get the channel that carries the sport.
Hey there, Ross!
Janice.
You know, you really didn't have to help me pack.
When you said all you'd be doing before you leave is packing you really didn't leave me much choice.
I thought I did, but I guess I did not.
What's going on?
I'm packing, you know, because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me!
I'm going to be pretend-moving to Yemen.
To get rid of her.
Good one!
Yemen!
That actually sounds like a real country!
I'll show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
It's a space-saver.
I do that because it makes me look taller.
Come on!
-Joey, trade lives with me.
-Nope.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.
This is brutal!
I can handle it.
Please, Ross.
You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
Look!
Right here, it's called a "scrum".
It's like a huddle.
And is a hum like a scruddle?
Ross, they're going kill you!
Why are you doing this, anyway?
You should've seen the guy she used to date.
He's like "Joe Rugby"!
You're kidding!
And he plays rugby?
That's funny!
Oh, I see.
You did that.
She thought the very idea of me playing rugby was hilarious.
So I'll show her how tough I really am.
I'm sorry.
You are a tough guy.
The toughest paleontologist I know.
Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.
Thanks.
Don't worry about me.
I'll just look energetic and stay away from the ball.
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.
Maybe there was a dog looking at him.
Stay away from that guy and that guy and that one.
Dude, they're all huge!
They're no bigger than me.
You're closer to you.
So you look bigger to you from where you are.
I'm going to go say "hello".
I kind of liked it.
I know what to do.
I've got to go Red Ross.
You know, Red Ross?
Totally don't know.
That time we were in line for Dances With Wolves and that guy cut in front of us and I just lost it?
Screamed at him, turned all red!
Red Ross!
You'll see!
Liam, do me a favor.
Go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.
You don't say?
Good luck, babe.
Come on, get in here!
Come on!
Come on, get in the bloody scrum!
Ross, get in!
Joey!
You're not going to believe it!
Joshua came in today, and guess what?
He asked you out?
But I showed him some cuff links, and I felt his pulse.
Saucy!
-What are these?
-Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, should I be scared?
I know that switch does something.
I got these from City Hall.
I just paid $25 and waited for three hours.
Wow!
If only more people knew!
All right, do you understand any of this?
No, I don't understand any of this electrical stuff.
All right, does this look like a switch?
I don't know.
-ls this wiring?
-I don't know.
That looks like a bunny though.
You really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh, please.
Every moment is precious.
Besides, someone had to ride with your luggage.
And your friends don't seem to care that you're leaving.
We're not that close.
Okay.
So I guess this is goodbye then.
Oh, no!
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving till you get on that plane.
Okay.
Well, I guess it's just "wait here" then.
I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket?
I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
Okay, what would you give a kid to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
She'll think I'm handing you a credit card.
But what I'll really hand you is a library card.
A ticket to Yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?
Do you have to stay?
American Express?
I can't believe they're doing that!
I told them to go easy on him!
No offense, but sometimes it's hard to understand you, with the accent.
That's just halftime.
There's more.
Did you see me?
I was pretty good.
That is one fun game!
Do me a favor?
Grab me some water?
Thanks!
I think I'm dying.
I really do.
Poor baby!
Tell my son that I love him.
Excellent!
Got to have some more fun!
They are killing you.
That's not true.
She's right.
You have to stop!
No!
I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross!
Dude, you go back out there, you'll be Dead Ross.
I'm not quitting.
I'm going to finish this game.
If you insist on it, at least let me help you.
It's no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything!
That's not it.
I just know a few things that can help you inflict pain.
I like that.
Listen closely.
Devon has got a weak ankle.
One swift kick and he'll back off.
Bad ankle.
Got it!
And that big bloke with the beard?
He's got a trick hip.
And David over there, he doesn't wear a cup.
I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup.
Okay!
And Liam's got bad knees.
Hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
But Liam's on my team.
-I don't care.
Just get him!
-Go and get him!
I am going back in!
Red Ross!
Yeah!
What are these?
Just some pictures I made and hung up.
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
Don't they?
No, don't.
There's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.
Oh, my God!
Look at this!
But there is a wire there!
It's connected to something!
I don't care!
The wires have come loose in your head!
If I could follow the wire, I'd find out what it did.
And did you?
No.
It disappears behind there.
For a minute, I thought it went downstairs.
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.
Hey, Mrs. Catrokis, do you know Kenny?
You have got to be kid Wow!
Are you sure you don't want a doctor?
No, that'll just bring me down!
This was great!
I was great!
This was a great day!
I'm buying everyone coffee.
Just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.
No, not you.
Your eye's still popping out.
I'll go get some ice.
Ice, yeah!
I'm so in the mood for ice.
You were amazing out there.
I kind of was, wasn't l?
Oh, my God!
I made a man twice my size cry!
I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?
Are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.
I gave a guy a bloody nose!
I'm not proud of it but I really am!
And it's all because of you.
-Wonderful, amazing you.
-I think you've got a concussion.
No, I'm serious.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry.
Did that hurt you?
It's worth the pain.
You know what?
It's not.
This is the final boarding call for flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I guess I gotta go.
My Bing-a-ling.
I'll wait for you.
How long will you be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
I'll write you every day.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Janice!
There you are!
I had to have one last kiss.
And also, you said you'd leave after I got on the plane!
No.
I want to see you take off.
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.
I'm going to Yemen!
When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.
The $200-an-hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
I give up.
Thank God.
I guess Joey was right.
It does nothing.
See?
I'm doing it!
I am totally doing it!
I lost it.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Cereal killer.
Cereal killer?
Hey, come on, I say more dumb things before 9 a.m than most people say all day.
What?
I can't find anything that I wanna eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.
I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake.
Oh, cake!
No.
Honey, I'm sorry.
What is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.
Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
It's me.
It's Phoebe.
Listen, there's something in here I want to eat.
What smells so good?
-ls it the shampoo?
It's guava.
-No.
Wait.
Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I can't believe it.
The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants meat.
I can't eat meat.
Wait!
Maybe it's the pickle!
The One With the Fake Party What are you writing?
Joshua's coming in tomorrow, and since I don't have the guts to ask him out I'm gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you never go out of style".
What did you throw away?
-Hi, guys.
-What have you guys been up to?
We went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs at the museum.
Without me?
My uncle dragged us there, but it turned out to be really interesting.
They were so ornate and beautiful.
Look at that.
I don't know how museums work in England, but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
I got it from the gift shop.
They have really lax security there.
It's a joke.
Anyone for more tea?
No, just me then.
Hey, Ringo.
Every time Emily's around, you talk like her.
Would you please cut it out?
I think you like it.
I think you can't resist me when I do it.
You want to eat me up like a cream "pumpy".
-What?
-All right, look, I don't know all the words.
Right.
I've got to be off.
I'll see you.
Bye-bye, then.
Bye-bye, then.
You guys seem to be having a good time.
She is amazing, and she's so much fun.
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun!
I do things like run off to Vermont and you guys saw the doorknob.
I even signed up for helicopter classes.
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.
Two days?
You must be bummed.
She's got to go back to London, but I've been prepared for this from the start.
We both knew we had two weeks together, and then that's it.
Hey, that's what all my relationships are like.
Yes, but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
-Pheebs!
-Hello.
Hello.
No, I know.
Yeah.
So the baby is totally craving meat.
I tried tricking it, and I made it a soy burger, so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.
And I got nauseous.
Maybe that's because soy burgers suck.
But I'm no obstetrician.
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.
At least you got that cool, pregnant-lady glow.
That's sweat.
You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Okay.
-Here's that trench coat that you wanted.
-Great.
It's comfortable.
You could really flash somebody in this.
No.
They don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?
Well, because we get a lot of They ruin it for everybody.
I know.
I wore that sweater on a date last night.
It was the first date since the divorce.
Congratulations.
So do you love her?
She's nice, but it made me realize I'm just not ready to be dating.
That's interesting.
-What was that?
-Just an anti-theft device.
Then what's this?
You need that too, because a thief could just tear this up.
We have to have a party in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What's going on?
We have to have a bon-voyage party for Emily.
But it's actually for Joshua.
That sucks.
Nobody's ever thrown me a bon-voyage-Emily party.
He said he's not ready to date.
So I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work.
And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
As much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him Emily and I won't be here.
She's gonna come by to say goodbye and then I've got a special evening planned.
Sorry.
No party.
-Hello?
-Surprise!
Surprise!
No one's thrown me a surprise party before.
Well, it was all Ross' idea.
You're so sweet.
And I'm so surprised.
You didn't know?
Why are you over here if Joshua's over there?
I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
Quick!
He's looking.
Say something funny.
Like what?
What's so funny?
I said, "Like what"?
Now that's a thinker.
This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
Hand me those cherries.
-Care for a cherry?
-No, thanks.
I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
You okay?
You all right?
We should probably get going soon.
But the party's just getting started.
We have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes.
Then The Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
Actually, American surprise parties are very short.
It's usually, "Surprise"!
Then, "My God, I'm so surprised.
Bye"!
Ross, I'm having such a great time.
Your sister told me that you used to dress up like old ladies and host make-believe tea parties.
Monica said that, did she?
Did she tell you that when she was little she was partially responsible for new legislation regulating the strength of swing sets?
Then what are you going to put on top of that?
-A little salami.
-Oh, yeah.
What goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami.
You're a genius.
Give me a hand with the zipper.
Up!
-You changed?
-I decided I needed my lucky dress.
-Lucky means more cleavage?
-lt does for me.
Look at him!
He's so cute.
I just want to grab him and kiss him.
How could I kiss him without him knowing I like him?
I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.
What?
-This scene in Footloose -Flashdance.
-Yeah.
With that plumber girl?
-A welder.
Were you, like, in the movie?
She takes off her bra under the shirt and pulls it out the sleeve.
Very sexy.
And classy.
-Or you could use mistletoe.
-It's not Christmas.
-Spin-the-bottle.
-He's not 11.
Thank you so much for this.
It was so thoughtful of you.
You're leaving?
-We have something we have to get to.
-I'm gonna take off too.
You can't leave yet.
You have to stay.
We've got the whole big thing planned.
What big thing?
Spin-the-bottle works like this: I spin the bottle.
Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
All right.
Who wants to go first?
I'll go.
Welcome to America.
Oh, my God!
Two in a row!
You gotta use your tongues now.
All right.
What are the odds?
That's enough!
Let's let someone else play.
If you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?
All right, I'll go.
Somebody loose.
Somebody loose.
Story of my life.
Story of my father's life.
Okay, my turn.
Look at that!
Oh, my God.
The baby just kicked!
It's okay.
It's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again!
Everybody just remember where they were sitting.
It was a bug.
It doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.
Okay.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
What are you doing?
I can't help it!
I need the meat!
The baby needs the meat.
You know when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat unless it's with someone really hot?
Totally.
This is the same kind of deal.
If you're gonna do something wrong do it right.
-I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.
What are you doing to me?
I'm trying to get Emily out of here, and you keep talking to her being all interesting and making her laugh.
I don't want you to be funny anymore.
Rachel wants me to be funny, you don't want me to be funny.
From now on, I'm gonna be funny sometimes, and not funny others.
You feel better now?
Yeah, but at what cost?
Six more months, three meals a day.
I am going to eat, like, you know, millions of cows.
Mommy cows, daddy cows, baby cows No.
No, I will never eat baby cows.
No veal!
Oh, but veal.
What if I even things out for you, meat-wise?
-What?
-I eat a lot of meat, right?
But suppose, until the baby's born, I laid off it.
No extra animals would die.
You'd be eating my animals.
I can't believe you'd do that for me.
Absolutely.
I could be a vegetarian.
There's no meat in beer, right?
We can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers and ask for our check right away.
We can't go now.
Rachel is going to put on a skit.
Oh, my God!
Have you lost your mind?
I am finally thinking clearly.
My lucky dress wasn't working out too well for me.
But for four years, this baby never missed.
Wait, I can't let Actually, I want to see what happens.
Nice costume.
Well, I wanted to give Emily a big American goodbye cheer.
Ready.
Okay.
Give me an "E"!
Give me an "M"!
Give me an "I"!
Give me an "L"!
Give me a "Y"!
What do you get?
Emily!
Emily!
That's me as a cheerleader!
I loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal.
I have a dentist.
I'll put some ice on it.
Excuse me.
-What do I do now?
-I think you're done.
Time to take off the bra.
That was really great.
But I gotta take off.
Take the bra off.
Let's go get your coat.
Rachel's my girlfriend.
So this was really fun.
Yeah, it was real fun.
You know, this bra is really bothering me.
This used to be my bedroom.
A lot of memories in here.
Lot of memories.
If these walls could talk, they'd say: "Want to hear some memories"?
Need a hand?
I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do.
God!
Forget it!
This is not how this was supposed to happen.
What was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me when I say this?
I thought that if I could get you here I could seduce you.
-Excuse me?
-Seduce you.
I don't wear suits to work.
And I bought six of them from you.
I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.
My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
-Why?
-Because I like you.
You like me?
I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
A lot of this isn't based on tonight.
But you like me?
I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me!
-But -No "but".
"But" is never good.
Let's leave it at "l like you and you like me".
-Okay.
However -No, that's a fancy "but".
My marriage, like, just ended.
And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
But.
I'm sorry.
I just need a little time.
Okay.
There you are.
I was looking for you.
Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
It's okay.
She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
It's too late to do the stuff I had planned.
I'm sorry.
I ruined your evening.
Yeah.
If it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Have a seat.
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.
It was just a two-week thing anyway.
I just didn't want it to end this way.
Or maybe you didn't want it to end.
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
I really do.
But what am I going to do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
No commitment.
That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you Iooking through Monica's photo albums.
You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here in a hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
You're right.
Thanks.
What photo album was it?
I don't know.
It was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh, my God!
Those weren't albino kids.
That was computer camp!
-You're a pathetic loser, right?
-Oh, yeah.
Sit!
Hi.
Oh, my God.
Joshua.
Look all those things I said about not being ready -They're not true?
-They're all true.
But.
I love that "but".
Do you want to go inside and get some coffee?
Okay.
Every time.
-What do you got there?
-Pastrami.
-You know what goes good with that?
-Corned beef.
I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.
-How about that smoked turkey?
-Okay.
Oh, mama!
-When is the baby due?
-Six months.
If a cow died of natural causes, I could have one of those, right?
Not if I get there first.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Oh, man!
-What's that?
-Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
What in the name of hell?
Maybe he found your flip-flop.
Is this porn?
I must have hit something on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
We didn't even pay our cable bill.
Maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.
Hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Joey pressed something on the remote and it just came on.
It happened to me once.
It was like finding money.
Finding money with naked people on it!
But I made the mistake of turning off the TV.
I never got it back again.
And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
The One with the Free Porn Do we really have to watch this while we eat?
We don't know what could make this go away.
So no one touches the remote, and no one touches the TV.
And no one touches the air around the TV.
Imagine a protective porn bubble, if you will.
I'm at least going to mute it.
We still have porn.
What are you doing?
That's too heavy.
Give it here.
Oh, God.
I'm too pregnant for lugging around a stupid massage table.
I need a job with a smaller table.
Or a job without a table.
You mean, like a doctor?
You're blocking the porn!
That reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.
Emily just went to the airport.
Why didn't you take her?
Her uncle had planned to do it.
We said our goodbyes this morning.
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.
Hey, cheer up.
You'll see her again, right?
I don't know.
When I brought it up, she said "This is so fantastic.
Why talk about the future?
-Let's enjoy" -Don't do the accent.
It really bums me out.
Emily said I was pretty good.
Well, that's someone you should hang on to.
You've got to see her again.
-Why do you care?
-Because!
You could live out my fantasy.
You had fantasies about Emily?
You know, the fantasy.
Meet a foreigner, fall madly in love and spend your lives together.
Is that why you hung out with that Ukrainian kid in school?
Yeah, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.
Do you love her?
We said it would only be two weeks.
You love her.
What is love, really?
I knew you loved her!
You go to the airport and tell her.
You'll probably catch her at the gate.
You'll call her name and yell "l love you"!
She'll say "l love you too"!
Then you will have the most amazing kiss.
Everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.
Things will start to heat up.
And then a stewardess comes in.
I've been watching too much porn.
-ls that the heartbeat?
-That's it.
Oh, my God!
This is so cool!
Have we talked about multiple births?
Let's take care of this one.
If l get pregnant again, I have your card.
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.
Doctors are wrong all the time.
Are you sure that there are three?
-Definitely.
-Oh, my God.
So in a few months, I'll have three babies walking around inside me?
It'll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out.
Giving birth to three is like giving birth to one.
What do you know?
-Have you ever had triplets?
-No.
I'm sorry, I haven't.
I'm going to use this a lot.
How'd it go at the doctor's?
You know how, when you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row.
And you say "Oh, that's nice".
Good news!
You'll have three babies.
Three babies?
I've finally got my band!
We'll have a big family!
I always wanted a big family.
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're happy!
I was afraid you'd be freaked.
Why would we be freaked?
Because it's harder to raise them and the added expense.
Right.
No, back to happy.
Back to happy!
It's going to be fine because I teach home ec.
I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long.
It'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
I was thinking, ever since you said we'd have triplets.
The best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.
No, you can't quit college.
You're in college?
Refrigerator college.
When we found out we were having a baby I figured I should have a career, you know?
And I love refrigerators.
You can't give up on your dream!
No, it's okay.
We're going to have three kids.
And that's a different kind of dream.
Three kids and no money.
This is the boarding call for flight 009.
What are you doing here?
I had to see you before you took off.
You are so sweet.
That's a big candy bar.
I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call for flight 009.
Well, that's me.
Here, have this.
I'm only allowed one piece of carry-on.
Listen, I have to tell you something.
I've been thinking.
I'm just going to say it, okay?
I think I love you.
Thank you.
It's no problem.
What is that song?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
You know who doesn't like dirty movies?
My boyfriend Joshua.
Yeah, right.
He said he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Did he also say that the dialogue was corny?
-And that he found it funny, not sexy?
-Yes.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Where you going?
To find out if he really thinks models are too skinny.
How'd it go?
Frank has to quit college because his super-fertile sister's having three babies.
I need to make money fast.
I wanted to talk to you about an idea.
You work for a big company.
Insider trading.
What information can you give me?
They don't talk to us about that stuff.
But I can get you free White-Out.
-Did you do what I said?
-I did.
-What'd she say?
-"Thank you".
You're totally welcome.
What'd she say?
She said, "Thank you".
I said, "l love you".
And she said, "Thank you".
That's not right.
Did you say you love her?
What were you trying to get her to do?
-What do I do now?
-You play hard-to-get.
She already lives in London.
So you go to Tokyo.
Forget it.
You told her you love her.
It's over.
It is not over!
You're over!
What?
You know.
Good one.
It's not over.
She'll call and tell you she loves you.
Her feelings were so strong that it scared her.
Go home and wait for her call.
She could call from the plane.
But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over!
Unless, eventually, I call her to see what's going on and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't.
Then it's over!
Way to be strong!
Can we watch cartoons on your TV?
We need a porn break.
We spent two hours watching In and Out and In Again.
Why don't you turn it off?
Then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.
Yeah, but that's not what you'd go by.
Look, I'm going to have a kid someday.
Okay?
And someday that kid is going to ask me if I ever turned off free porn.
I don't wanna have to tell him that I did.
Did you ever asked you dad that?
I don't want to talk about it.
Good, you're here!
What you got there?
This?
I'm glad you asked.
Don't you hate to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife?
I know what you're thinking.
Pregnant woman slays four?
-Did they make you pay for those knives?
-No.
-Are you sure?
-No.
You won't make enough money by selling knives.
I just need enough money for the second part of my plan.
-What's that?
-My Saturn dealership.
Hello.
-Ross.
-Emily.
Hi.
How was your flight?
It was dreadful.
It was terrible how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, that's all right.
I'm just glad you called.
Ross, there's something that I've got to tell you.
There's someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
She doesn't know who she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.
So I told her when she figures it out, give me a call.
Maybe I'll still be around.
When you say "still around," you mean still around like you might be in a relationship or still around like you might have died waiting for the phone to ring?
But it was so right.
This isn't how it's supposed to go.
There can't be another guy.
Of course, there's another guy!
This is even more perfect.
You have to prove your love!
I'm not proving anything.
I'm done listening to you.
If I hadn't let you talk me into this I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.
You did that?
I missed and hit the door.
But it opened really hard.
You have to go to London.
You have to go fight for her.
That makes sense.
You said you loved her, and she didn't say it back.
Then she told you about another guy.
Go to London.
Scare her!
When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight.
I just told you, I made fun of him behind his back.
Oh, I see.
-You want that to happen with Emily?
-No.
All right then, go fight for her!
It's like a snake pit.
That could be you and Emily.
That but nicer.
Go to London!
Really?
Surprise her.
Don't let her go without a fight.
All right.
I'm going to do it.
I'm going to London, and I'll fight for her.
Okay.
Good luck!
Can you pick me up one of those Toblerone bars at the airport?
I did it!
I figured out a way to make money.
I'll open a massage place.
Frank will help me.
We'll work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.
But how can you afford it?
We were walking down the street, and we saw your van.
-And we realized -I'm telling it!
People need transportation, and they need massages to relax.
We can combine the two.
I give massages and Frank drives.
I'll bolt a table in the van, and you know what I've got?
A place that no one will get out of alive?
Think about it.
It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.
It's a Relaxi-Taxi!
The name was my favorite part!
-I came up with it.
-You did not!
You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.
Oh, my god!
Are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?
No, she hasn't come home yet.
She hasn't been home all night.
She must be with the other guy.
I'm the stupid moron who spent the night here.
-What was that?
-I just put my fist through another wall.
Tell the guys.
When is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Stay there for a while.
If she doesn't show up, come home.
There's a girl at the restaurant that would be perfect for you.
Tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
Ask him if he likes it better than Relaxi-Cab.
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab.
Like Taxi-Cab.
That is better.
Do you have any 8's?
No.
Are we in London?
Why are you here?
You can't be here.
I've come to talk to Ross.
What?
Nothing.
I was going to call him You came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!
I was right!
I'm right, right?
I'd rather talk to him.
I've been to his apartment and he's not there.
I need to talk to him.
Do you know where he is?
Ross, are you there?
Ross, I don't know if you hear this, but I'll talk anyway.
I'm in the States with your sister and friends.
It's all over with Colin.
I came here to tell you that and to tell you Yes, Joey, you can have all the chocolate you want.
I came here to tell you that I love you.
I love you too!
I'll call you right now from the phone booth.
You can't hear me.
I wish I knew if you'd heard me.
I suppose I've given my neighbors a good laugh.
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, bugger off.
None of your business.
There's not much chance you did hear that.
There's the call waiting so I should go.
Oh, well.
Ross, I love you.
Thank you.
I was just at the bank.
There was this really hot teller and she didn't ask me to do it with her in the vault.
Same thing happened to me.
Pizza delivery girl comes over, gives me the pizza and leaves!
No "Nice apartment, bet the bedrooms are huge"?
Nothing!
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
Ready?
One, two, three.
That's kind of nice.
That's kind of a relief.
You want to see if we still have it?
-Free porn!
-We have free porn!
There's one, two and three.
-Oh, my God.
-That's so beautiful.
-Oh, man.
-I can't believe it.
I know.
I like the middle one the best.
Don't worry, I won't let the other two know.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
It is true what they say: Pregnant bellies look like a drum.
I'm so pregnant that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.
So I'm going to play my songs on this drum.
It sounds really cool!
Listen, listen.
Smelly cat, smelly cat What are they feeding you?
That sounds great!
I know!
And I've only been playing for an hour.
-What are you doing here?
-I came to ask you a big favor.
Don't tell me you want to keep more stuff in my uterus.
Okay.
Now, see.
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.
And Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank Jr., Jr. Wouldn't that be Frank lll?
Don't get me started.
Anyway, since there are three babies and we both got to put our names in we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby.
That's so nice!
Cougar.
Think about it.
The One with Rachel's New Dress I left a bra drying in there.
Will your son think it's yours and be traumatized?
Mommy can have a wife.
Daddy can have a bra.
It's time to go.
See, that clock's a little fast.
We still have 17 minutes.
What can we do in 17 minutes twice?
Well, that's ambitious.
You can ignore that.
That's your son.
Believe me, when he's older, he'll understand.
I'll be right there.
This is Carol and Susan.
-It's so nice to finally meet you.
-You too.
-Susan will be in London next week.
-I've never been there.
-I'll show you around.
-Great!
Also, I was hoping to catch a show.
Any suggestions?
There's tons of terrific stuff.
I'll go with you.
Look at you two bonding.
Making us late for the airport.
Are you all right?
It's just us getting along is difficult for him because he doesn't like me.
Come on.
That's.
It's true.
How did we lose?
Do we have a baby name yet?
No.
It's so hard!
I went through this book and found nothing.
I want a name that's really strong and confident.
You know?
LikeExxon!
It certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
You want a strong name?
How about The Hulk?
I'm not sure about Hulk, but I like a name starting with "The".
You want a good name, go with Joey.
Joey's your pal, your buddy.
Where is everybody?
They're hanging out with Joey!
If you're going to name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.
Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and very lovable once you get to know him.
Joey's lovable too.
But with Joey, if you need him, he'll be there.
Chandler will be there too.
He might be a little late but he'll be there.
And he'll bring you cold soda if what you need him for is that you're really hot.
What do you say?
I like the idea of naming him after someone I love.
Joey and Chandler are both great names.
All right, I don't Maybe I'll just name him The Hulk.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.
I wanted to name my kid that.
If you hoped to sleep with Joshua, which one would you wear?
It creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
I'm sorry.
I'm just so excited.
I've been waiting for months.
I got my hair colored.
I got new sheets.
I'm making him a very fancy meal.
What am I making him, by the way?
A frisee salad with goat cheese and pine nuts wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon en croute.
I thought I was making him filet mignon.
You decided to make salmon because you had some left over.
Then you realized if you bitched, then you would stop cooking and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
I really get crabby when I cook.
Why go through all this trouble?
He's a guy.
You'd serve the potato and he'd still want to have sex with you.
That is not how I operate.
We've got to get a new game.
So Emily called last night.
And now you're giving me the message?
Turns out that Emily is just crazy about Susan.
They're going to the theater together.
They're going to dinner.
They're going horseback riding!
God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just a little too familiar.
For six months before Carol and I split up all I heard was, "My friend Susan is so smart.
My friend Susan is so funny.
My friend Susan is so great".
You think something could happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they're going to the gym together!
Two women stretching!
They take a steam, things get playful.
Didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna!
Hi!
You're crazy.
Emily is straight.
How do you know?
We thought Carol was straight.
Yeah, definitely.
I don't like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down!
No, I meant for the baby.
What's wrong with Ross?
Something like this would never happen to The Hulk, you know.
That's not true.
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found.
You know.
Never mind.
My girlfriend's a lesbian.
I'm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
You gotta pick Joey!
Name one famous person named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler.
Someone you didn't make up.
There are no famous Joeys.
Except for Joey Buttafucco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
How about a compromise then?
What if it's Chan-no-ey?
Joey?
Think about it.
He'll never be President.
There will never be a President Joey.
I didn't want to bring this up.
Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life!
It's not a name!
It's barely even a word.
It's like chandelier but it's not!
Then, you put it together with Bing and forget about it.
It's a stupid, stupid, non-name!
You're right.
I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
So I guess it's Joey then.
This is so nice.
Thank you for doing this.
Please!
Cooking soothes me.
So dig in!
It all looks so good.
Oh, my God.
I know.
My God, this rice is so I am so good!
Behind you.
They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there some way that they could not be here?
Farm birds really kind of freak me out!
Here we go.
There you go!
Hey!
How'd you do that?
All gone.
So, farm birds, huh?
It's my only weird thing, I swear.
I would have told you.
I didn't know that they'd be here.
Can I serve you a little What?
Nothing.
It's just that I know that they're still out there.
They're across the hall.
That's two doors away.
It'll take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
That's not funny.
Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
We could pack this stuff up and go to your apartment.
They're working on it.
It's a mess.
I'm staying at my parents' house.
We could go there.
They're out of town.
It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view.
It'd be very romantic.
-What do you say?
-Yeah, that works.
They can smell the fear.
How's Ben?
I asked if he wanted to eat.
He said no.
I asked if he wanted to sleep.
He said no.
I asked what he wanted to do.
He said no.
So he's sweeping.
Any word from Susan?
She said she's having so much fun with Emily.
By the by, did it ever occur to you that maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
What's too much fun?
The kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
Oh, my God!
You are so paranoid.
Am l?
Am l?
Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Carol, so were we.
Just imagine for a moment that Susan meets someone, and they hit it off.
They're coming back from the theater, and they stop at a pub for drinks.
They're laughing.
Someone innocently touches someone else.
There's electricity.
It's new.
It's exciting.
Are you saying there isn't the slightest possibility of something happening?
-Maybe.
-Oh, my God!
I didn't really believe it until you just said it!
None of the other kids believed me, but I swear that duck pushed me.
This place is fabulous!
This is the downstairs living room.
There's two living rooms?
Growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
It would have been, but my parents just moved here.
You should know this place is a real babe magnet.
Want to make out?
Why don't I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?
That sounds like a plan.
Is there a place that I could go freshen up?
Just down the hall and second door to your left.
-Hi, darling.
-What are you doing here?
-We cut the trip short.
-France sucks!
This may be a little weird, but I've got a date here.
Say no more.
We'll grab some food, go upstairs and be out of your hair.
That'd be great.
So you didn't get to ltaly?
Yep.
Sucks!
Hi, you!
Oh, my God!
I know.
I can do more than cook.
I like her.
She seems smart.
Rachel, my parents.
So nice to meet you.
Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
What, this?
Oh, no.
That's not what it is.
Okay, I work in fashion.
And this is a real dress, actually.
They're wearing it in Milan.
Part of my job is to wear the clothes and see how people respond.
Then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's.
Obviously, in this case I am going to report back: "U.S.A. not ready".
Maybe in L.A. There you go!
Have you kids eaten yet?
We were going to do that after.
I mean, next.
Why don't we all get something to eat?
No use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
So we'll go eat.
You'll wear that.
We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
I am sorry about what I said.
Nope, you're right.
It is a ridiculous name!
It's not bad.
Yes, it is!
From now on, I have no first name.
You're just Bing?
I have no name.
So what are we supposed to call you?
Okay, for now, temporarily, you can call me Clint.
No way are you cool enough to pull off "Clint".
What name am l cool enough to pull off?
Gene.
It's Clint.
It's Clint!
Bye, Gene.
It's Clint!
What's up with Gene?
You wore your nightie to dinner?
The best part was when the waiter spilled water down my back.
I jumped up and my boob popped out.
It's all right.
I got nice boobs.
I just picked up a message from Emily.
She and Susan are going to a poetry reading together.
-So?
-So?
Poetry?
Susan's gay.
They're being gay together!
Emily's straight.
Oh, wake up!
Carol really messed you up.
Excuse me?
She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous sycophant!
So I don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.
What are you talking about?
I am not a crazy, jealous person.
She's right.
When we were together, you got upset about Mark, and there was nothing.
This makes sense.
It does not!
In high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends cheated on you.
So up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.
Then '94 hit, Carol left him, and bam!
Paranoid City!
Absolutely!
This is so fun!
This is not fun!
All we're trying to say is don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you've got with Emily.
The '92 Ross wouldn't.
I still think I was right about that Mark thing.
Well, you know what?
I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drumroll.
All right.
Help!
Am I a Mark or a John?
You're not tall enough to be a Mark.
But you might make a good Barney.
Look, I am serious.
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going to the courthouse.
You're going through with this?
This name has held me back my entire life.
It's why kids picked on me and why I never do well with women.
So tomorrow, I'll either be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You've got problems because of you, not your name!
This has got to stop!
Chandler is a great name.
In fact.
I'm sorry, I know you wanted me to name the baby Joey.
I'm going to name the baby Chandler.
Really?
But you have to keep the name too.
Okay, thanks!
You want to hug it out?
I'm going to go tell Frank and Alice right now!
Bye, Pheebs!
-Nice luggage.
-I was going to say.
I missed you too.
-Thanks, I had a great time.
-So did l. No tongue.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Morning's here The morning's here Sunshine is here The sky is clear The morning's here The morning's here Hey!
Do you have to do that?
It's Saturday!
Oh, come on!
Morning's here!
I hate this apartment!
I hate this wall color!
I hate that it still smells like bird!
I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding?
I love that guy!
Morning's here Stop it!
I will kill you.
I hate that my room is so small.
I have all the space I need.
Do what I did.
You don't even have a bed.
You sleep in a ball on the floor!
I am tired of your bellyaching.
I've worked hard to make this a nice place for us.
I know.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
It's a great apartment!
Shut up!
This place is a hole!
The One with All the Haste I still can't believe you've got an earring!
I know, I know.
Who am l?
David Bowie?
He does that?
I don't know.
Whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Oh, I know.
You know what?
I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you.
When I'm with you, I'm like this whole other guy.
I love that guy!
I mean, I love you too.
A lot.
But that guy!
I love that guy!
I love both of you.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Then don't.
Stay here.
Don't go so soon to London.
Just one more day.
Please don't do this to me again.
I'd stay, but I've already missed so much work.
They'll fire me.
So?
Then you could stay as long as you want.
I wish I could.
Oh, no.
Don't start packing.
Come on!
I don't think you understand packing.
I don't want to leave it till last.
Last time, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, I know.
I tried them on.
You didn't!
No, I didn't.
I didn't want to be "that guy".
Excuse me?
Your pants.
Oh yeah!
You like them?
I went to a used-clothes store and got maternity stuff.
These are so comfortable.
Pheebs, those are Santa pants.
Santa pants.
Santa Claus' pants.
No.
They're maternity pants.
They even came with a list of baby names.
See?
These names are good, and these are bad.
Hey, Phoebes.
So, how are the elves?
I don't know.
How are theyou know?
Your clothes aren't funny.
What should I wear to a Knicks game?
A T-shirt that says, "l Don't Belong Here"?
You have tickets?
Mom got Dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.
Apparently, they're good seats.
Oh, my God!
Those are almost on the floor!
I could slip Woody Allen my resume.
Do you guys want these?
Yeah, we do!
Well, you got them!
Just give us our apartment back.
Oh, I didn't see that coming.
Are you serious?
Come on.
We know what these are worth.
Do you think we're stupid?
Not stupid.
You're meaner than I thought.
What do you say?
Forget it.
I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for basketball seats.
Your "bachelor pad"?
Have you even had a girl here?
No.
But Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning.
Yeah, you do!
Come on!
Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
Come on.
Season tickets!
Season tickets!
You know what that means?
I'm not giving up the apartment.
When I was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets to the No.
1 salesman every year.
My dad never won.
Of course, he wasn't in sales.
But still, I never forgot that!
Hey guys!
Oh, my God!
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Oh, yeah.
Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I like it.
Emily likes it.
That's what counts.
So, how are you guys doing?
Don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Where's Emily?
She's saying goodbye to her uncle.
Didn't she, like, just get here?
Easy, tiger.
I just hate this so much.
Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off".
-So what'll you do?
-There's nothing to do.
She lives there.
I live here.
She'd have to move here.
She should move here.
What?
-I can ask her to live with me.
-Are you serious?
-I mean, why not?
-You've only known her six weeks!
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.
Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like.
She brings out this great side of me.
I mean, I love her, you know?
And I love the milk!
But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.
Joey, you say things now.
Look, Ross.
He's right.
Emily's great.
She's great!
But this is too soon.
You'll only scare her.
I don't want to do that.
You don't want to wreck it.
Don't go too fast.
No.
You're right.
I know, you're right.
I'm not going to do it.
-Thanks guys.
-No problem.
Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
It's too hard.
Too hard!
All right.
Last chance for the tickets.
Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No, thank you.
Wait, wait.
Come on, come on!
Let's trade.
The timing's perfect!
I just clogged the toilet!
I want those seats.
But we can't live in the small apartment after living here!
Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Ever read Sports Illustrated?
No, I didn't read yours!
We can go to the game tonight!
The only way I'll consider this is if they offer more than just season seats.
-It's the Knicks!
-Screw the Knicks!
I didn't mean that.
I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
And the Knicks rule.
Yeah, the Knicks rule!
So?
Are you going to do it?
No, we're not going to because it's not an even trade.
All right, look.
What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?
Done!
Let me finish.
I'm talking about a bet.
Winner takes all.
We could get nothing.
Or everything.
I like that.
What do you say?
Just do it!
Oh!
I'm convinced!
Come on, man!
You know I'd do it for you.
Because you're my best friend.
All right.
But you can't use that again for a whole year.
I'm in.
This is so exciting!
What are you going to bet?
We should let Phoebe decide because she's the only one who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
I have a game!
-This is great!
-What's the game?
It doesn't have a name.
No, okay.
Phoebe Ball!
No, it doesn't have a name.
What is your favorite thing about trees?
-They're green?
-Good!
Five points!
Same question.
-They're tall.
-Three points!
Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy.
Leafy.
That's not even a game.
Shut up.
We're winning!
You want to finish this?
We get a deck of cards.
High card wins.
What do you say?
-Let's do it!
-Oh, I have cards!
Yeah.
Here.
No, these are the trick deck.
Here, yes.
Okay, you guys pick first.
-Four.
-That's a low one!
You look.
I can't do it.
What makes you think I can?
Ace!
Why are you hugging?
We won our apartment back!
What?
Ace is high!
Jack, queen, king, ace!
No!
Ace is low!
Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know.
Look it!
Come on, pick again!
Come on, apartment!
Come on, apartment!
I know queen is high!
Not as high as.
It worked!
King!
We pick again!
We pick again!
-Why?
-I don't know.
Tickets, please.
Courtside, baby!
Seriously, good game, though.
Good game.
What are they so mad about?
They got the apartment back.
No, they didn't.
Packed while you were gone.
I left knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me?
What?
Don't be scared.
It sounds crazy, and people will say it's too soon but just think.
Think how great it would be.
I don't know.
Leaving London.
My whole family lives there.
-My job.
-You'll get a job here.
I always hear about them foreigners stealing American jobs.
That could be you.
Yeah, but it's my whole life.
You come to England.
I would.
I really would.
But my son is here.
I can't leave him.
You don't think there's any way?
I don't think so.
It would be different if it was way into the future and we were getting married.
What?
Right.
I shouldn't have said "married".
Please don't go freaky on me.
I didn't mean it.
I take it back.
No.
Don't.
Why don't we?
Why don't we what?
Get married.
You are mad!
No, I'm not!
It's perfect.
It's better than you moving here.
It's us together forever, and that's what I want.
-We've known each other six weeks!
-I know.
So what?
Who's to say?
Does that mean we can't do it?
Look.
I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.
I mean, this.
This makes sense for us.
Our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced.
Me!
This feels right.
Doesn't it?
My parents will be really mad.
Are you saying, "Yes"?
Is that "Yes"?
Yes.
-We're getting married!
-Oh, my God!
We're getting married!
Come here, come here.
Emily, will you marry me?
It's a bit small.
Damn!
I thought that'd be romantic as hell.
It was.
Those were, like, the best seats ever!
Should we give these to the girls?
Like a peace offering?
That's very nice.
Plus, they were free and too small.
Oh, God!
Hey, you want a beer?
I know!
Open up!
Open up!
Open up!
We'll discuss it in the morning.
What the hell is going on?
We took our apartment back!
I had nothing to do with it.
Okay, it was my idea.
But I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back right now.
No, we're not.
We're not leaving!
You'll have to.
You both have jobs.
As soon as you do, we'll switch back!
You can't stop us.
-Right, Joe?
-I don't know.
What?
I don't want to move again, with.
This is our apartment and they stole You stole!
Our apartment!
We won it fair and square.
Twice!
And I am getting it back right now!
I'm getting it back right now!
All right.
We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
No more offers.
You can't offer anything to us!
-Let us keep the apartment and -As a thank you Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
-Totally worth it!
-That was one good minute!
Good night.
-Men are such idiots.
-I know.
Can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
If you had just done that after the last contest no one would have had to move at all.
Let's pretend that's not true.
Scarf's done.
Come on, come on!
What's going on?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Emily and l, we decided to get married.
What?
Oh, are you pregnant too?
No.
When did How did you We just decided to go for it.
We know it's a bit hasty but it just feels so right.
I was just telling the guys Yeah, I heard.
I think it's great!
I'm so happy for you!
Well, yeah!
Congratulations!
I can't believe you're getting married!
Monica and Rachel made out.
Morning's here The morning's here Sunshine is here The sky is clear The morning's here -Hey, you're back!
-Hey, get into gear Breakfast is near The dark of night has disappeared I'll see you tomorrow morning!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Are you kidding me?
Joey?
Did I wake you?
The One with All the Wedding Dresses Gunther, could I get another cup of coffee?
So what do you do when you're not working here?
-You don't need to fill these silences.
-Okay, thanks.
That's your fourth cup of coffee.
Okay, do me.
I've had a certain number of juices.
I'm exhausted because Joey started snoring.
He's in a different room.
He's that loud?
You should hear me.
It's nothing to be proud of.
Go to a sleep clinic.
I'm not going to any clinic.
I don't have a problem.
You have the problem.
You should go to a "Quit-being- a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.
-They don't have those.
-Yeah, they do.
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!
There, you just had your first class.
I used to date a light sleeper.
Whenever I snored, he rolled me over Oh, yeah!
He'd roll me over, and I'd stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over!
I gotta do what I gotta do.
You gotta do what you gotta do.
Hey, guys.
Oh, the Olympics!
-Have you picked a date?
-No.
Not yet.
I still cannot believe you're engaged.
Because it's so fast.
Not because you're a loser.
Thanks.
Has anyone seen Rach?
She's upstairs not doing the dishes.
I won't do them this time.
Even if they sit there until.
I'll do them when I get home.
Emily found this wedding dress in London -Already?
-But it didn't fit.
There's a store here with one left in her size.
But the groom can't see -I'll pick it up for you.
-Thanks.
She's got you running errands, picking up wedding dresses.
Wah-pah!
What's wah-pah?
You know.
Whipped.
Wah-pah!
That's not whipped.
Whipped is.
That's what I did.
You can't do anything!
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes.
Do you have a minute?
I was just about to take a break anyway.
So listen I know we haven't had a chance to talk since Emily and l decided to get married.
And I was just wondering how you were.
If you were getting married, I would feel kind of.
You know?
It definitely took me by surprise.
But, you know I'm okay.
I just wanted to check.
That's sweet.
Thank you.
You're great.
And I know someday this will happen for you too.
You just hang in there.
"Hang in there"?
No, I didn't mean.
You haven't heard of a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"?
I thought you had just been on four dates.
I didn't realize that had become anything.
Oh no, it has become.
Oh no, those were four great dates.
I mean, and the connection!
Emotionally, mentally.
You know?
Physically.
-That's incredible.
-I know, isn't it?
I'm right there with Joshua.
You are right there with Emily.
And it's kind of like it's a tie.
I gotta get back to my dishes.
I gotta get to work.
You know what would make me happy?
You know, what's that?
If the four of us could all, you know, hang out together.
Emily's coming into town this weekend.
Why don't we all have dinner Sunday night?
That would be great!
All right.
It's a date!
"Hang in there".
You hang in there.
-Did you say something?
-No, just singing.
Oh, my God!
Look at this one!
It's so beautiful.
About half of these will end up getting divorced.
May I help you ladies?
I'm here to pick up a dress on hold.
What's the name?
-Emily Waltham.
-Yes, I have it right here.
Would you like to try it on, Miss Waltham?
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
I am, aren't l?
Miss Waltham?
We're closing.
All right.
And could I get my ring back?
All right, buddy.
Time to roll over.
You are going to a clinic!
You're going to a clinic!
And a pajama store!
Does she use the cups?
Yes, I believe she does.
Does she use the plates?
Yes, I believe she does!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.
-Just a second.
-No, no!
Let me in!
Can you hold on a minute?
No!
You have to let me in right now!
Are you alone?
All right.
This sucks.
I have to stay up all night before I go to the stupid clinic.
I'm so tired.
It's six o'clock.
I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
I think that's really cool.
I think you're handling that really well.
"Handling it"?
There's nothing to handle.
Maybe I'd have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
They're not going to get married anyway.
They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
They'll be engaged for like what?
A year?
One of them will realize what they've done and call it off.
You'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
You know, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not?
Weddings are a great place to meet women.
When I dance, I look like this.
Hey, man.
What are you doing four weeks from today?
-Nothing.
-Nothing.
I am free.
Because we're getting married in a month.
-What?
-Yes.
In a month?
-You mean 30 days?
-Yeah.
From now?
That's great!
She always wanted to get married where her parents did but it's getting torn down.
I know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy and it just feels right.
Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
This isn't mine.
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hi.
What's up?
Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
See you and hug you.
See you.
Great!
Sit.
You okay?
I'm more than okay.
I am really, really happy.
Want to know why?
Do l?
Because I am really happy about us.
I think we are so on the right track.
I think we are working.
I think we are clicking.
-You know?
-Yeah, sure, sure.
We're clicking.
If there was just one little area where I think we need to work on, I would think it's that we're just not crazy enough.
I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.
You know, yeah, you're right.
We have our fun.
Yeah?
I mean, like crazy!
You know?
Are you gonna put on that cheerleader outfit again?
No.
You wish.
All right.
This is going to sound, you know, a little hasty.
But just go with me.
What if we got married?
-What?
-Oh, I know.
It's so totally like "Whoa, can we do this"?
You know?
But it just feels right.
Don't you think it does?
I mean, it just feels right.
Don't you?
Rachel you're a real special lady.
But my divorce isn't final yet and we've been on four dates.
So I'm thinking: No but thanks.
You idiot!
-Your name, please?
-Joey Tribbiani.
Did you stay up all night in preparation for your study?
Sir?
Yes, he did.
All right.
We'll call you in a few minutes.
Check out that girl.
She's really hot.
Yeah, she is.
How you doing?
You looking good.
-What?
-You're coming on to the entire room.
-I'm Chandler.
-I'm Marjorie.
-Do you mind if I sit?
-Please.
So what are you in for?
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence!
I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Are you ready?
I got it!
Mine!
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!
My turn, my turn!
Okay, ready?
That was a terrible throw!
I won't throw it right to you.
That's not real.
Look at me.
My big concern is what's real?
Oh, my God!
We're really sad, aren't we?
Yeah, I think we are.
This isn't even my dress.
At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late".
-I'm changing out of this.
-Me, too.
In half an hour?
Me, too.
All right, now throw it straight this time.
I'm getting married!
I hate my regular clothes now.
I look down and I know this won't be the most special day of my life.
I mean, it was kind of fun for a while but didn't you feel kind of silly?
I guess.
Oh, my God!
You're such a cheater!
Hello, little ones.
-So, is Joey going to stop snoring?
-Yep!
And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
Joey wanted to ask her out, but, you know, she picked me.
How'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
No, seriously.
She's the kind of girl.
Joey was unconscious.
Hey, you guys!
What's happening?
Oh, my God!
What is that?
They gave it to me at the sleep clinic and it's going to help me not to snore.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
You don't have to wear it unless you are.
I know I don't have to.
It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
Hope I didn't stretch Emily's dress.
Your butt's not that much bigger than her's.
I just called Joshua.
How'd it go?
I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who's dying to get married.
And I'm going through a hard time.
What'd he say?
His answering machine was very understanding.
I feel blue.
I bet you anything he'll call you again.
Yeah, maybe.
But, you know, I don't think I even care.
I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
But as it turns out I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
You know how Ross and I have always been on-again, off-again?
I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road we would be on again.
Again.
You know what?
I think we all did.
I got us reservations for Sunday night.
How about Ernie's at 9:00?
Well, you'd better make it for three.
I don't know if we're going to be hungry at three.
Three people.
Joshua's not going to be there.
What happened?
Well, I think he broke up with me.
No.
Why?
Apparently, he scares easy.
Rachel, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
Come here.
Don't you have to go pick up Emily?
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
I got my girls.
Hey, you know what might cheer you up?
What?
I got to tell you this really does put me in a better mood.
I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.
Maybe someday there will be.
Chandler's coming by to borrow candles for his big date.
Rachel, don't get it!
He'll see us!
The groom cannot see the bride.
I'm not going to marry Chandler.
Not after this!
Okay guys, just relax.
I do!
I got to go.
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
Food's here.
Fair enough.
Fifteen-minute warning.
Late.
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
All of a sudden, so much is happening.
I know.
Ross is getting married.
Phoebe's making people.
-Everybody's doing stuff.
-We just sit here.
If I died, people would know I was here only by the ass print on this chair!
-What are we doing?
-Wasting our lives.
I meant for lunch.
We have to do something.
Something huge!
We could climb Mt.
Everest.
Not something stupid.
Something huge!
I saw an ad for this video.
People climb that thing every day.
We could totally do that!
Why not?
I mean, it's just climbing.
-It's just steep!
-Yeah.
We're going!
It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.
What's up?
-We're gonna climb Mt.
Everest.
-Yeah, baby!
I looked into that.
Yeah, but it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die.
And you would die.
We could get that Everest video.
We could do that without risking our lives at all.
While we're at the video store, we could rent Die Hard!
I just remembered.
That Everest thing is only available through mail order.
So you'll stay here and hang out with me?
But one of these days we'll get off our butts and rent Die Hard again!
The One with the lnvitation That was fast.
It usually takes me hours to get Ben to go down for his nap.
He's such a sweetheart.
Do you know what he said?
-Good night, mommy.
-That's because he has lots of mommies.
Yeah, in fact, it's kind of become his word for "woman".
So does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Oh, God!
Nobody likes him.
He's so cheap.
He'd never fly to London in a million years.
Invite him!
Did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they're fine.
We'll say that Ben addressed them.
You invited Rachel then?
Sure, why not?
Really?
I wouldn't be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.
Do you think we shouldn't invite her?
You know I absolutely adore Rachel.
It's just that I thought it might be awkward for you.
But it's absolutely your decision.
-More tea?
-Sure.
Earl Grey?
Fine, invite whoever you want.
I don't want to be single, okay?
I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars!
Oh God, Monica.
Thank God!
This is Rachel.
Another Lincoln High survivor.
This is Chandler.
Phoebe.
Joey.
-Do you remember Ross?
-Sure.
Back in high school I had a major crush on you.
I knew.
You did?
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did.
Listen, do you think Try not to let my intense vulnerability become a factor.
Would it be okay if I asked you out sometime?
Maybe.
Okay, maybe I will.
See, I see big passion in your future.
-Really?
-I do.
Ross, you're so great.
It's never gonna happen.
I have a question.
Actually, it's not so much a question.
It's more of a general wondering ment.
Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to.
Yes, yes.
That's right.
Look!
What?
Top of the world looking Down on creation And the only explanation I can find Listen, missy!
If you want this cart, you'll have to take me with it!
-Did you see that?
-You were incredible!
A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you.
More clothes in the dryer?
I'm fine.
You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.
I was doing great with Julie before I found out.
I was doing great too.
It's not easy for me to see you with Julie.
I don't need this right now.
It's too late.
I'm with somebody else.
This ship has sailed!
All right, fine!
Go ahead and do that.
I don't need your stupid ship!
This is the first time I'm doing something I care about.
I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
If you don't get that I get that, but I'm tired of your answering machine.
I don't know what to do.
Neither do l!
Is this about Mark?
Oh, my God!
Okay, it's not.
I can't keep having this same fight over and over again.
You're making this too hard!
I am?
What do you want me to do?
I don't know.
Look, maybe we should just take a break.
You're right.
Let's cool off.
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
A break from us.
-Why are we rushing?
-The girlfriend I told you about.
She wants to get back together with me.
I found it!
That's so great for you guys!
-Good luck with your girlfriend.
-Thank you.
-You got my message?
-You are right on time.
Can I be your girlfriend again?
You can very much.
I want you to leave.
Get out!
I want to talk about this.
All right, how was she?
-What?
-Was she good?
Don't answer!
You wanted to talk about it.
How was she?
She was.
-She was not good, not good.
-Nothing compared to you.
She was different.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
Just stop!
The way you owned up to everything.
It's just showed me how much you've grown, you know?
I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.
She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater".
I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective.
We were on a break!
You seem to really like her.
What do I do?
We agreed it'd be a two-week thing.
No commitment.
That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you Iooking through Monica's photo albums.
You don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
You've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here in a hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
-You're right.
-Yeah.
This is so amazing!
My brother's getting married and in London!
It's so romantic.
Hey, pretty smart!
Tissue paper.
You're at the wedding.
You have to cry.
Handkerchief?
No, I got my invitation.
Isn't this adorable?
Ross let Ben address mine.
Did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?
No.
Don't worry, I get to bring a guest.
We'll show him.
I'm so jealous you're all going.
I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.
I didn't, either.
I knew that.
So I didn't know that.
But you should see your faces.
What's up?
Just hanging out.
What's this?
Ross' wedding invitation?
Maybe that's the one we should have hidden.
No, you guys, come on.
You don't have to do that.
I'm happy for him.
I am.
I really I'll work on it.
I'm sorry.
You're going to come, though, aren't you?
I don't know.
This isn't one of those "lf she doesn't come, we don't come"?
-I bought my ticket.
-You're not even invited.
You know what would be real weird?
If you weren't there.
-Just say you'll think about it.
-I'll think about it.
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross'.
Oh, my God!
He remembered.
Remembered what?
It was months ago.
We were walking by this antique store.
I saw this and told him it was like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl.
I can't believe he remembered!
This must've cost a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Remember when he fell in love with Carol and got her that expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Oh, my God!
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.
Oh, my God!
-We were in school together.
-We haven't seen each other since.
I land in China.
Guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
That is so sweet!
No, you hang up.
No, you One, two, three.
You didn't hang up!
She didn't hang up either.
Okay, no.
No, you hang up.
You!
Ross, hi.
It's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you and your cat.
Obviously, I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call closure.
I got a message from you.
Oh, my God!
Hang up the phone!
Give me the phone!
You're over me?
Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you under me?
Basically Iately, I've.
I've sort of had feelings for you.
I need to lie down.
He broke up with Julie!
Go hug her, for God's sakes!
-Really?
-Really.
It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, God.
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
That's okay.
You're worth the wait.
And I don't just mean tonight.
Oh, God!
Honey.
That's okay.
No, you just rolled over the juice box.
Did you say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place?
I'm sorry.
Was I not supposed to?
You ended it!
Because I was mad at you.
Not because I stopped loving you.
You still love me?
What does this mean?
Do you want to get back together?
Maybe.
I don't know.
I just, I feel.
I can't believe I even thought of getting back together.
We're so over!
Fine by me!
And hey!
Just so you know, it's not that common.
It doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal.
I knew it!
Rachel's coming up.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Oh, my God!
This is us getting ready for the prom.
We don't have to watch this.
Yeah, we do!
Come on!
-Get a shot of Monica.
-How do you zoom out?
There she is!
Shut up!
The camera adds 10 pounds.
So how many cameras are actually on you?
Dad, turn it off!
It is off.
Right, Ross?
Looking good, Mr. Kotter!
I can't go to my prom without a date.
It's too late.
If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.
I have a wonderful idea.
You should take Rachel to the prom.
We've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.
-I want to see!
-Fine, I'm not going to watch.
Come on, kid.
Let's go.
Are you handsome!
Let's show them!
-Okay, Dad.
-Rachel, ready or not.
Here comes your knight in shining Oh, dear!
How do I turn this off?
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well.
See?
He's her lobster!
No.
You're really not going?
It's just going to be too hard.
You know, I mean it's Ross.
How can I watch him get married?
It's just for the best.
You know?
It is.
Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
She's going to be pretty big by then.
She'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.
Drive her to the hospital if she goes into labor.
You don't have a car.
And your license expired.
There's so much to do, and I have so little time!
Check this out.
There's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.
"It's almost as good as being there".
It's better!
You can't go to a museum in your underwear.
You could, but just the one time.
We could get videos of the sights get a VCR in our hotel room and never have to go outside!
-lf we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
-I bet the British version is good!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
That was the 10th time I've peed here.
It's also the 10th time you've told us.
Sorry, it must be hard to hear.
It's easier having babies playing "Bring in Da Funk" on your bladder!
I am so sick of being pregnant.
God!
I can't sleep, except on my back, which hurt.
So I can't sleep.
My only happiness is from a cup of coffee which is decaf because I'm pregnant!
You want a cookie?
Thank you so much!
So, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
I haven't had any yet.
The One with the Worst Best Man Ever Hey, guys.
All right, here's the ring.
Yes, yes!
A thousand times, yes!
Any ideas for the bachelor party?
Before rings and bachelor parties, you have to decide who your best man will be.
Oh, it's awkward.
I already asked Chandler.
He got to do it at your first wedding.
I figured you'd understand.
I've known him longer.
I don't have any brothers.
I'll never be a best man.
You can be the best man when I get married.
I'll never get to be a best man!
Wait, wait.
So you'll be my best man twice, and I won't be yours at all?
Of course, you can be my best man.
-What about me?
You said I could.
-I'm not getting married!
It's a question for science-fiction writers.
I can't believe it's not me.
-How could it not be me?
-I'm not even You know what?
That's it.
From now on, Joey will be my best man.
Shame about you, though.
-Stop it.
-What?
One of the babies is kicking.
That's a good thing.
It's not kicking me.
It's kicking another baby.
Don't make me come in there!
Do you have a big bowl I can borrow?
There's one under the cabinet.
-Why do you need it?
-We're having a party tomorrow night.
-Are you planning on inviting us?
-No.
Later!
Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!
Hormones.
How come you're having a party and we're not invited?
-It's Ross' bachelor party.
-So?
Are you bachelors?
Are you strippers?
Then you're not invited.
Then you're not invited to our party either.
What party?
Phoebe's baby shower.
Baby shower?
That so doesn't sound like something I want to do.
I can't believe I'm going to have a party.
That's so great.
A party!
I don't know why.
This is what I got going for the party liquor-wise.
-Get a lot of liquor.
-Great.
In terms of the invite list, I got you, me and Chandler.
I'll invite Gunther because we're talking pretty loud.
I'll be there.
I know it's your party but I'd like to limit the number of museum geeks.
Let's not invite any anthropologists.
Just the dinosaur dudes.
We'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Hey, what are you doing?
Just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Good luck trying to top the last one.
It won't be that difficult since this one won't be in the basement of a Pizza Hut.
I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut.
I gotta go pick up Ben.
Everything sounds great.
Keep it on the mellow side.
A few guys hanging out.
-No strippers or anything.
-You got it.
See you later.
Have fun planning your mellow party.
There will be strippers.
He didn't say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers".
I chose not to hear that.
Look what I got, look what I got!
They make these for little people!
Little Village People.
Look at this one.
This is my favorite.
That is so sweet.
Phoebe will love dressing them.
Except she won't be the one who gets to dress them.
She won't get to keep the babies.
My God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower!
Unless we give her all gifts she can use after her pregnancy.
Like regular coffee.
Tequila!
-A carton of cigarettes!
-She doesn't smoke.
-It's the thought that counts.
-It's a great idea.
And those leather pants she's always wanted!
She'll love that!
What the hell is this?
You thought it'd make me feel better?
To give me something I can't use for two months?
This sucks!
-Who gave me this?
-Well, l They told me you like them.
All right, then I'm wrong.
It's a great gift.
The best present I ever got!
What's my next present?
We don't have anything.
All right, fine, then this is over.
Balloons!
-Listen, about the stripper.
-Yeah?
Good call!
So I'll be hosting your next bachelor party?
Joey, I'm kind of hoping this will be my last one.
A little announcement.
I've decided that my best man is my best friend Gunther.
What's my last name?
Central Perk?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Hey, Gunther!
Don't forget your shirt.
What are those?
Little party favors.
Check it out.
Just want everybody to know the position of my best man is still open.
So is the position of the bride.
Great.
Smooth, man.
You got some chili on your neck.
I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great!
See you guys Monday morning.
-Thanks, Joey.
-Don't forget your shirt.
Hey, museum geeks!
Party's over.
Wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.
Boys, come on out.
Here you go.
Look at the birdies!
Are those yours?
They let you keep chickens and ducks as pets?
And I got the duck totally trained too.
Stare at the wall.
Hardly move.
Be white.
You are good at that.
I had fun tonight.
-You throw one hell of a party.
-Thanks.
It was great meeting you.
If any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday.
Yeah, that'd be great.
So, I guess, good night.
Unless you want to hang around.
I'll let you play with my duck.
Stripper!
The stripper stole the ring!
Chandler, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!
-What?
-The ring is gone!
Just give me a minute to wake up for this.
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man!
This isn't funny.
I go to sleep, everything's cool.
I wake up, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!
-You slept with her?
-Of course!
-Hi, guys.
-Hi, Phoebe.
I wanted to apologize if I seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower.
Just the hormones.
-No, we -Hormones.
I wanted to say thank you.
It was so sweet.
You seem to be doing much better.
-How are things going?
-Good.
Everything's been about me lately.
So what's happening with you?
We were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
It just might be too hard, given the history and all that.
This reminds me of the time when I lived on the street.
This guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
How is this like that?
Well, let's see.
It's not really like that.
Because that was an actual problem.
And yours is just a bunch of high-school crap that nobody really gives!
I'm sorry.
I just thought Here come the water works.
I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
I called 911 and they yelled at me.
This is an emergency!
I really wanna help you out, but I got plans to go see Titanic so I've got to call 911 to find out what time it starts.
Hey, guys.
Thanks again for last night.
What a great party.
The guys from work had a blast.
One of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Another one had never been to a party before.
So that wedding ring.
-Man, that is nice.
-Yeah, right?
I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
Where might one get one of those?
When my grandmother first came to this country that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
Absolutely.
It's been in my family for generations.
Every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
So you might say it's a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
What?
-What did you just -I think I heard what he said.
I believe it was, "The stripper stole the ring".
My ring?
My wedding ring?
The stripper stole my wedding ring?
How could this happen?
It all started when you said, "Joey, you be my best man"!
All right.
I'm going to call the cops.
I screwed up.
But you don't have to turn me in.
-Not on you, on the stripper.
-I already did that.
They said they'd look into it after they solve all the murders.
-We'll call the company that sent her.
-I did that too.
They wouldn't give me her real name.
They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring".
So, what are you telling me?
There's nothing we can do?
-How could this happen?
-Look, Ross, I am so sorry.
What if we just called her used a fake name and had her come to my office?
That sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
Here's your tea, Phoebe.
It's so good.
Thanks.
-Good.
-So glad you like it.
What?
She made the tea.
I think I just had a contraction.
-What?
-My God!
I felt one a few minutes ago.
That definitely was one.
You can't have the baby here.
I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
It's okay.
I'll boil some water and rip up some sheets.
It's probably false labor.
That can happen near the end.
Just get the book.
-Get the book!
-The book!
-The Bible?
-I don't know!
All right.
This is great.
You get behind the desk.
When she comes in, she won't recognize you because Well, why would she?
And then you buzz Ross and l. You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
Anybody call for security?
You be cool.
Which one is Gunther Central Perk?
Joey.
Where's my ring?
My dead grandmother's wedding ring.
Way to be cool, man.
What?
There was a ring in a box.
After you left, it was gone.
You think I stole some ring?
We know you took it!
Just save yourself the time and confess.
Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
I don't need to steal a stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week.
Any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I don't get it.
It was in my room all night.
She didn't take it.
I didn't take it.
You didn't take it.
Then who did?
We're trying to think.
I don't get how you know it's false labor.
Do you see any babies?
-How do you feel?
-Okay, I guess.
I don't know.
I know it's going to be over soon so.
But isn't that a good thing?
-You said you were sick of this.
-I know.
Usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing you get to do the mom thing.
But I'll be sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
Some moms do that.
That's even sadder.
Look, I know what I got myself into.
It's just that now that they're in me it's like I know them and.
It just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.
I know, sweetie.
But it's not like you won't have anything.
You'll have nieces and nephews.
That's even better.
-Yeah, okay.
-No, really.
You won't be the one worrying about saving for college.
Or yelling at them when they're bad.
Or putting them on Ritalin when they just won't calm down.
You'll be the one they run away to.
The one they talk to about sex.
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
Cool Aunt Phoebe.
I am pretty cool.
And you know what else?
Are they going to love you!
They are going to love me.
Thanks, you guys.
Again.
Oh, sweetie.
Thanks.
What?
Just kidding.
Oh, my God!
Got you again.
You're so easy!
If anything happens to him The vet said it's a simple procedure.
Things can go wrong.
What if he doesn't make it?
-He will, Joe.
-But what if he doesn't?
He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him!
Somebody lose a ring?
Oh, my God!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
How's the duck?
Just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.
Great.
-Thanks for being so cool.
-No, that's all right.
You made me your best man and I totally let you down.
-It's not your fault.
-Yeah, it is.
You wouldn't have lost it.
Ross, you were right.
He should be your best man.
-No, you should.
-Don't argue.
I get to choose my best man.
I want both you guys.
Really?
Both you guys should be up there with me.
You two are my I'm lucky to have just one good Thanks, man.
I got to go check something, okay?
-What a baby!
-Total wuss.
-How come you're getting Nana's ring?
-Mom gave it to me.
She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need one.
I really didn't need to tell you all that.
I don't really think it's fair.
I mean, I've always loved that ring.
Oh, Mon, I'm sorry.
I'd let you have it, but Emily's gotten really attached to it.
Thanks.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Emily, did you know that that ring spent two days in a duck's colon?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hurry up!
The flight leaves in four hours!
There could be traffic!
The plane could leave early!
In London, there could be a line at customs!
Come on!
Six-hour trip to London.
That's a lot of Monica.
What have you got there?
Condoms, dude.
Well, how come the writing is in spanish?
Don't read my condoms.
Passport, check.
Camera, check.
Traveler's checks, check.
-Who are you saying "check" to?
-Myself.
For remembering to pack a thing.
You do a good thing, you get a "check".
Mom does it.
I never realized it was weird.
My mom used to put her head in the oven.
Actually, only the one time.
But it's pretty weird.
Are you ready yet?
-Got the tickets?
-Right here.
Check!
It's all London, baby!
Here we go.
Got your passport?
Third drawer of my dresser.
You don't want to lose that!
There it is!
The One With Ross' Wedding The vacuum's in my closet on the left side.
Garbage bags are next to the refrigerator.
Rachel's gonna be here.
Can't I just ask her?
Yeah, okay.
Give that a try!
-Let's do it.
-Cheerio!
London, baby!
That's not gonna get annoying.
London, baby!
You know what?
I was wrong.
We're all here.
Let's get going!
I want to go over and hug you and wish you luck, but I can't get up.
-I'll come hug you.
-Great, can you bring me the paper?
-Have a great wedding.
-Thanks.
Chandler, I want to hug you too!
You might as well bring my book from your apartment.
-So we're off.
-Have fun!
-I can't believe you won't be there.
-I know.
Come.
Why don't you come?
To London.
Please?
It would mean so much to me.
I gotta work.
I'm sorry.
Why can't you take a couple of days off?
Because I can't.
I told you.
This is my wedding.
Now we are late.
Let's go, let's go!
Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go, Phoebe!
Phoe-bo!
Phoo-ba-la!
You!
Let's go!
Bye, Pheebs!
London, baby!
Oh, God!
Do you need a hug?
You don't have to bring me anything.
Chandler, do something!
-Do something!
-I am.
I'm ignoring you.
I'll be the on-camera guy.
All right.
First stop Westminster Abbey.
What is that?
That's London, baby!
All right, the hotel's here.
Wait.
We want to go I know.
I'm gonna have to go into the map.
If you see a little version of me in there, kill it!
I got it.
Here we go!
We're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?
Man, you made me lose it!
That was all before 10:00.
The caterer rang.
It'll be Chicken Kiev, not Tarragon.
Then the florist said there are no tulips.
And the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome Emily, honey.
Okay?
Well, up yours too!
-What?
-Oh, that's not what it means.
-No!
That's "time out".
-Sorry.
Sweetie, relax.
Everything will be great, okay?
Come on, come on.
Chicken Kiev?
Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
Salmon would be more elegant than chicken.
And you wouldn't worry about the salmonella.
But of course with salmon you would have to worry about the chicknella.
I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
It's beautiful.
Her parents got married here.
I can't believe they're tearing it down.
It's really the most lovely building.
It's over Oh, my God!
It's nice.
Oh, my God!
What are we going to do?
Everything's gonna be all right.
How's it gonna be all right?
I see that.
I talked to a guy, and I found out what happened.
They tore it down early.
All right!
Westminster Abbey.
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.
What do you think of the Abbey?
It's great!
They're thinking of changing the name.
-To what?
-To "Put the Camera Away"!
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Don't worry, you'll find some place to get married.
Sorry.
Lucky this dress is red.
We can't find another place.
Then we can't have the wedding.
I've ordered chicken, and salad, and cake for a 150.
What should be the most wonderfull day of my life is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food.
You're gonna find a place.
But even if, God forbid, you didn't, so you postpone the wedding.
Is that really so bad?
Think about it.
You could take all the time your needed to get everything that you want.
You could have tulips.
You could have salmon.
Salmon.
I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world.
Oh, thank you.
Look, either way you're gonna get married.
You're gonna be happy.
My mom's gonna like you better than me.
Oh, God.
She has told you that already, didn't she?
-Don't get up.
What do you need?
-Nothing.
Come on.
I'm here to take care of you.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
That is all you.
What do you want for lunch?
I don't know.
I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do.
What's the matter?
I'm bummed the way I left things with Ross.
I wish I didn't lie about work.
He seemed so mad at me.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
If I was still in love with some Still in love with?
I'm not in love with Ross.
Good!
Yeah, me neither.
I'm not at the wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend and that would be uncomfortable.
Not because I'm in love with him.
I like Ross as much as anyone.
Clearly, I have feelings for him, but they don't mean love.
I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross?
Yeah!
I have continuing feelings of love.
But that doesn't mean I'm still in love with him.
I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you tell me?
-We thought you knew!
-We?
We all know.
We talk about it all the time.
You all know?
Does Ross know?
No!
Ross doesn't know anything.
And you didn't tell me!
We thought you knew.
It's so obvious!
It would be like telling Monica: "Hey, you like things clean".
Or, you know, "Hey, Joey, you're gay".
What?
Oh, please, she's always got a broom in her hand.
What are you in the market for?
Scarves, souvenir postcards.
Check this out!
That's the stuff!
What do you think?
I won't need that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it.
Here you go.
You're not really buying that.
Haven't you embarrassed me enough?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous.
All Londoners wear them.
Really?
Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
They're all tourists.
If you insist on wearing that in public you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself.
If you make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
-Good choice.
-Thanks.
That's it!
I'm out of here.
I won't be embarrassed any more.
How are you doing?
Joey Tribbiani, America.
I spoke to your dad, and you know what?
He thinks we can find a new hall.
-We don't have to.
-You found a place?
No, but Monica and I were talking and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down and she suggested we put the wedding off for a bit.
She said what?
If I won't be happy with somewhere we'd find in a day we should postpone it.
Postpone it.
Do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this?
Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here?
This isn't right.
I realize that people are gonna be disappointed.
But I'm sure they'll come back.
I can't ask people to do that.
Would you?
Don't you point your pants at me!
We have no choice.
Anywhere half-decent will have been booked.
Don't you understand?
This is our wedding!
Postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.
-You're saying it's now or never?
-I'm saying it's now.
-Or?
-There's no "or" in mine!
What is wrong with these pants?
It's not the pants.
It's you who's backwards.
If you don't understand how important this is to me perhaps we shouldn't marry at all!
Emily, no!
Wait, stop!
Emily, please Did shopping help you feel any better?
Manhattan doesn't have enough stores.
I can help you get over him.
You can?
I need you to bring me photos of Ross and a small piece of chocolate and a glass of tepid water.
Is this where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Only if you have the hiccups too.
The chocolate and water are for me.
I didn't feel like getting up.
I'll show you a picture of Ross.
And you remember all the bad things about him.
-Focus on his flaws.
-I can do that.
I did that while we were going out.
Before we start, I want to say, for the record, I love Ross.
He's such a great guy.
Close your eyes.
Imagine that you're with Ross.
Imagine that you're kissing him.
You're running your hands all over his body.
You run your hands through his hair but Gross!
It's some kind of grease.
I don't know.
His hair never bothered me that much.
It was more crunchy than it was greasy.
This will be harder than I thought.
Let's try some aversion therapy.
Look at the picture.
How do you feel now?
Well, I like you less.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said you were embarrassing me.
That wasn't cool.
If it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Me too.
-Yeah?
-No!
I had the best day ever!
Dude, check this out!
Tell my friend you like my hat.
-What's your friend's name?
-Chandler.
Hi, Chandler.
-That's -That's Fergie, baby!
Joey says you don't like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
So I hear you're single now.
- Yeah, I don't like the hat that much.
-Okay.
When did you?
How?
I was trying to get to Buckingham Palace.
So I'm in my map and I understand you had a talk with Emily.
Yes, I did.
And you are welcome.
Am l?
Was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Wait up!
Since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle: What do you do when the bride says she doesn't want the wedding at all?
She said that?
Why?
I don't know.
I said it was stupid to put off the wedding and she, like, flipped out.
Oh, my God!
You're even dumber than I am.
Excuse me?
How long have you been planning this wedding?
I don't know.
A month?
Emily's probably been planning it since she was 5.
Ever since the first time she hung a pillowcase from her head.
That's what we did.
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
In the perfect place.
With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.
With the little people on top.
But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that stuff was.
I had no idea.
That pillowcase thing, I thought you were doing The Flying Nun.
Sometimes we were.
Come on.
Help me figure out what to do.
Pretty intense, huh?
I hope Ross didn't think we left because we were uncomfortable here.
I hope he did.
I thought of a good flaw.
Ross pops his gum.
Oh, right.
-Wait a minute.
I do that too.
-I know, it drives me crazy.
I'll get it.
Pheebs, it's Joey.
Hey, Joey!
I saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
I was going to say hi, then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
That just cost me 4 bucks.
I called to see how the chick and the duck are doing.
They're having fun with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful.
So do you miss me?
Kind of, but I've been having too much fun.
You're not homesick yet?
I don't think so.
Well, the seven of us miss you.
-Who's seven?
-Me, Rachel the birds, the babies.
The babies miss me?
Of course they do, or I'm just really hungry.
Pizza guy's here!
You ordered pizza without me?
But we were thinking about you.
We ordered the Joey Special.
Two pizzas?
-Gotta go!
Talk to you later.
-Wait!
Where did you get it from?
And they're always glad you came You want to be where you can see Your troubles are all the same You want to be Where everybody knows your name Why have you brought me here?
You'll see.
This wedding won't happen.
Ross.
But imagine a lot more lights and fewer bricks and flowers and candles.
And the musicians can go over here.
The chairs can face this way and You go.
But if you don't love this, we'll do it any other place or time.
Really, it's fine.
Whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I don't know, if it rains Then we'll get wet.
I don't even have a date.
Do you remember where the duck food is?
In the guys' apartment, under the sink.
Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What?
What do you mean?
I have to tell Ross I love him.
Take care and don't have the babies till I get back.
But what about all the finding-his-flaws stuff we've been doing?
Yeah, that didn't work.
You can't go.
Ross loves Emily.
I know, but I have to tell him how I feel.
He deserves all the information to make an informed decision.
You're going because you hope he'll say: "l love you too.
Forget the British chippy".
You think he will?
No, because he's in love with the British chippy!
You're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding.
It's too late!
You missed your chance.
I'm sorry.
This must be hard.
But it's over.
No, it's not over until someone says, "l do".
I do!
I do!
Like I can really chase you.
I'm carrying a litter!
The Waltham residence.
Is this Emily's parents' house?
This is the housekeeper speaking.
And, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
What are you saying?
Now, let us try that again, shall we?
No!
Oh, my God!
-The Waltham residence.
-Hello.
This is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please if it's not too much trouble, please might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Miss Waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.
And it is not polite to make fun of people.
Goodbye.
I'll be nice, I swear.
Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding, and I have to warn somebody.
So if you don't give me that number, I'm gonna come over there and I'm gonna kick your snooty ass all the way to New Gloukenshire!
Hello?
Hello?
She knew I could kick her ass.
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Mom, Dad.
Sorry we're late.
My fault.
I insisted on riding the tube.
Judy, the kids!
Jack, that's what they call the subway.
-I thought -Dad, we got it.
Here comes my dad and stepmom.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller.
-This is Steven -Hello, darling.
and Andrea Waltham.
Very nice to meet you.
Darling, the Gellers.
Darling, it's the Gellers.
She's very self-involved.
I should never have married her.
-It's the Gellers.
-Where?
That's one and that's another one.
Lovely to meet you.
Nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
The hell with tradition.
We're happy to do it.
We know how expensive weddings can be.
Besides, this may be the only wedding we get to throw.
A joke that's funny in all countries.
Sir?
-What's in it?
-Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.
That's not food.
Everything's different here.
I want to go home.
I miss my family, the coffeehouse.
I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like!
It's been three days.
Okay, you're just homesick.
Would you just try to relax and just enjoy yourself?
You're different here too.
You're mean in England!
What the hell?
What's up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding.
It's insane.
How can it be so much?
The reception's at their house.
Flowers, liquor.
Re-carpet first floor?
New guest bath, landscaping.
I'm paying to remodel this guy's house.
I'm gonna give that son of a bitch a piece of my mind.
Please.
I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight.
She's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.
Here.
Let me go talk to him.
You tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
And I'm gonna go get drunk.
-Hello.
-Hello.
When is your next flight to London?
There's one leaving in 30 minutes.
And I do have one seat left.
Thank you, thank you.
The last-minute fare on this ticket is $2700.
Huh.
How about 600?
-Sorry.
-How about 600 and these earrings?
They prefer it if I don't barter.
I don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
You can split it with another card.
How about five?
Thank you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my nightstand.
You know what?
I have my driver's license.
And I have a 20.
Face it.
My father is not going to pay for the built-in barbecue.
And believe me, you can kiss your gazebo goodbye.
I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he'll laugh in my face.
This is ridiculous.
I mean, we had an agreement.
Will you say something, Steven?
Don't take that tone with me.
All right, you can.
Thank God!
You changed your mind.
You probably want to be alone, you don't want to talk about it.
You're doing the right thing.
Where are you going?
What are you doing?
No, wait.
Why am I always pregnant when she does that?
I'd like to make a toast to Ross and Emily.
My big toast is tomorrow.
This is kind of my little toast, or Melba toast, if you will.
Okay.
I've known Ross for a long time.
I knew him when he was with his first girlfriend.
I thought things were going to work out for him, until the day he over-inflated her.
Oh, dear God!
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.
Mrs. Waltham.
I need to speak with one of the best men or Ross' sister, Monica.
-Who is this?
-Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.
How did you get this number?
I got it from your maid.
She's a bitch, but I wore her down.
If you're one of Ross' best friends, why aren't you here?
I can't fly.
I'm having my brother's babies.
Am I on the radio?
Can I talk to one of them?
It's important.
I'm bored of you now.
I'm going to cut you off.
Oh, okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
We're excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall.
To think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall.
Come on, Monty Hall!
Let's Make a Deal.
Come on, you people!
All right, forget it.
Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here.
Congratulations to the happy couple.
I first met Ross in this coffeehouse back home.
Home.
New York City.
Where everybody knows my name.
Anyway I love you guys.
But not as much as I love America.
Can we please go home now?
Are you going home?
I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
I was laughing.
Out loud?
I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
So how are you?
My mother's driving me crazy.
But Ross is getting married.
I'm happy.
I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Thanks.
We like him.
My God!
You must have been a teenager when you had him.
There's no way in hell I'm paying for it.
Look, we're down to just one point.
Could we please just settle it after the wedding?
Fine, but I'm not paying for your wine cellar you thieving, would-be-speaking- German-if-it-weren't-for-us, cheap little man!
The guy was hammered.
There's no way you look like Ross' mother.
-Then why would he say it?
-Because he's crazy!
He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
My mother's right.
I'll never get married.
You know what, that is Who wouldn't want you?
Please!
I'm a single mom with a 30-year-old son.
-Hi, I'm back.
Listen, I need to -Hello.
Hello.
I need to get on that 11:00 flight.
I'm afraid that plane's already pulled away from the gate.
You're going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and pick me up.
-Can't do that.
-Sure, you know what?
We'll just tell them that there was, like, a problem with, like, the engine.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to step aside, miss.
Look, if I don't get to London he is gonna marry that other girl.
Can't imagine why.
All right.
You know what?
I am not leaving here until you call that plane back.
I'm getting married today!
Morning.
-I'm getting married today!
-Yeah, you are.
Do you think he knew I was here?
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.
If you're going to do that throughout the flight, tell me now so that I can take a sedative.
Or perhaps slip you one.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Sorry.
It's just, I'm kind of excited.
I'm going to London to tell this guy that I love him.
Well, I've never done that with you before.
So how are you?
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
You?
We did you.
Well.
-I better get going.
-Absolutely.
Could you not look?
I don't want to look.
Where the hell have you been?
I spent the night out.
I met this cute bridesmaid.
She is so I don't want to hear it!
Pheebs, you know you're still my number-one girl.
No.
No.
We have an emergency.
Rachel's coming to London.
Great!
No, it's not great.
She's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
But he loves Emily.
I know that!
You have to stop her.
She's going to ruin the wedding.
Okay.
-All right, so -Hold on, hold on.
Rachel coming.
Do something.
I've done my part, okay?
It's your responsibility now.
The burden is off me.
-Right?
-Right.
So tell me about this girl.
And so then I realized, all the stuff that I had been doing proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding -was all just a way -Oh, oh, oh, oh!
I'm sorry, can I interrupt?
I just want to say that you are a horrible, horrible person.
Pardon me?
You say you love this man, and yet you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.
I'm afraid I have to agree with your friend Pheebs.
This is a terrible, terrible plan.
-But he has to know how I feel.
-But why?
He loves this Emily person.
No good can come of this.
-Well, I think you're wrong.
-Oh, no.
Well, he doesn't really love her.
It's just a rebound thing from me.
-You'll see.
-Fortunately I won't.
And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Do something.
Something.
-Have you seen Monica?
-I'm not seeing Monica!
-What?
-What?
We gotta find her.
Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him.
-Oh, my God!
-I know.
Do you know where Monica is?
No.
What's with the third degree?
Why not just shine a light in my eyes?
Oh, my God!
It's like a fairyland.
I know.
It's horrible, isn't it?
I love it.
I only hope my wedding looks this good.
-I just hope -You can let some of them go by.
Start looking out for Rachel.
I'll cover the front door.
You watch that big hole.
And I got Chandler covering Ross.
Why would I care where Chandler is?
You know sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Okay.
I do.
I do.
I do.
-You're right.
It's the second one.
-Right?
Hello, Joey.
Hey, Felicity.
I thought about you all day.
Talk New York to me again.
Forget about it.
How you doing?
There's nothing to discuss.
We're not paying for your wine cellar.
You have to meet me in the middle here.
My foot's gonna meet the middle of your ass.
-What's going on?
-Everything's under control.
You want a piece of me, sir?
Is that what you're saying?
That's it!
Parents!
Parents!
Back away!
This is our wedding day!
From now on, everyone gets along.
And if I hear one more word no grandchildren!
That's right!
-Okay, okay.
-Sorry, old boy.
I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
What was all that about?
It was this disagreement over My God!
You look beautiful.
You're not meant to see me before the wedding.
It's bad luck.
I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
My God, Rachel!
You're here.
I can't believe it.
What happened?
Why are you here?
I just came to I just needed to tell you congratulations.
Hello, Waltham lnteriors.
Mrs. Waltham?
It's Phoebe.
Why?
Can I talk to one of the best men?
This is going to be the last time.
There's a girl on the phone for you.
Great!
It's Phoebe.
Did you stop Rachel?
No, but it's okay.
She just came in and gave him a hug.
That's it.
-Nothing got ruined?
-No.
That's so great!
So, what's going on now?
I'm walking down the aisle.
Still walking.
I'm about to pass the bridesmaid I hooked up with last night.
Hey.
I just told her "hey".
I'm at the front with Ross.
It's Phoebe!
He looks pretty mad.
I better go.
Wait!
Hold it up so I can listen.
-What we did last night was -Stupid.
Totally crazy, stupid.
What were we thinking?
I'm coming over tonight though, right?
Definitely.
Friends, family we are gathered to celebrate the joyous union of Ross and Emily.
May the happiness of today be with them always.
Now, Emily, repeat after me.
-l, Emily -l, Emily -take thee, Ross -take thee, Ross.
as my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health till death parts us.
As my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health until death parts us.
Now, Ross.
Repeat after me.
I, Ross I, Ross take thee, Emily take thee, Rachel Emily.
Emily.
Shall I go on?
"Mother, Mother, Pizza, Pizza," take one.
Oh, the band's ready?
We gotta do what the band says, right?
I don't care about the stupid band!
-Well, it's getting late.
-Here we go.
Actually, you guys mind staying here with me for a while?
You know, we gotta get up early and catch the plane to New York.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
Why, what's the matter?
