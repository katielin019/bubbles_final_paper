{START OF EPISODE 1}
Good morning, Mr. Feeny.
Good morning, Mr. Matthews.
A candy bar?
Doesn't your mother feed you a proper breakfast?
Oh, yeah, she does.
And I got to get the taste of this Shredded Wheat out of my mouth.
You know, you're not doing your body any favors loading up on junk like that.
Oh, thanks, Mr. Feeny.
And please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink you're sucking down.
There's no gravity in space, Mr. Matthews.
Therefore, astronauts suck up.
Learn from them.
He's a teacher, man.
Keep raggin' on him he's gonna make your whole sixth-grade year miserable.
I'm gonna be miserable anyhow.
At least this way, I'm taking him with me.
Hey, who's that?
I think she's new.
She must be new.
She's talking to Feeny.
OK, so how late did you stay up last night?
Monologue.
Monologue, first guest.
Monologue, first guest, bad sketch.
Monologue, first guest, bad sketch funny zoo animal.
Monologue, first guest bad sketch, funny zoo animal Steve Lawrence.
Whoa!
Steve Lawrence!
And there's the bell.
She's dead, Mr. Bornihay.
Pick up the knife and kill yourself.
Come on, Mr. Feeny you and I both know she's not really dead.
May I please stab her a few times just to make sure?
Hey, you touch me with that knife you better kill me the first time.
Mr. Feeny All right, all right.
Cory.
Huh?
What's the score?
Bottom of the third, Dykstra's on second, Kruk's on first What's this, Mr. Matthews?
Huh?
W-what did you say, Mr. Feeny?
You took my hearing aid.
Smoltz delivers, Daulton swings.
Oh, he got a piece of that one.
It's a long drive deep to center.
Otis Nixon back, back to the warning track climbs up the wall, and ohh!
Mr. Matthews, Romeo and JuLiet is Shakespeare's ultimate testament of love between a man and a woman.
HeLp!
HeLp.
Mr. Feeny!
HeLp!
Help!
Help!
Miss Kincaid, thank you.
Thank you for that, uh vigorous interpretation.
Mr. Matthews, you do not listen to the ballgame in the middle of my class.
Mr. Feeny, who cares about some guy who killed himself over some dumb girl?
The tragedy here, Mr. Matthews is not about a dumb girl or the boy who kills himself because of her.
It's about the all-consuming power of love and the inevitability of its influence on each of our lives.
Are you aware that I'm only 11 years old?
Are you aware that you have detention Friday afternoon?
No, actually, I did not know that.
You will?
OK, great.
Yeah, me, too.
All righty.
oK.
Bye.
Yes!
Yes!
Phillies won, I'm going out with Heather Ralston!
You know what that means?
It means every guy in the It means if they win Friday night they're in the playoffs.
Look, Cory, we got to talk about something.
That makes the game we're going to the most important game of the year!
Look, Cory, my date with Heather's Friday.
Now, look, I got a slight case of detention from Feeny but I'll just meet you at the bus.
What?
!
It's the only night she was available.
You're not going to the game?
That's terrible.
Actually, Cory, it, uh it gets worse.
She's going to the game with us.
You're really close.
She and I are going to the game?
Come on, Cory, it's my first date with her.
It's really important to me.
But, Eric, going to the Phillies game's like our special thing.
Cory, I'm trying to get a special thing going with Heather.
Now, look, you could be happy for me and accept this like a mature guy - or you can - Dad!
Overreact.
Dad!
Just the kid I want to see.
Mom, we have a major problem.
You have detention with Mr. Feeny.
How could you possibly know that?
He stuck his head over the fence and told me while I was bringing in the groceries.
I Want to move.
Why did you get detention?
You know, you're missing the bigger issue, Dad.
You bought a house next to my teacher.
I Want to move.
I Want to move now.
Get the guy with the gold jacket.
I'll be in the car.
Why did you get detention?
Apparently, he'd rather listen to the baseball game on the radio than try to understand the emotional content of Romeo and JuLiet.
Mom, I'm a kid.
I don't understand the emotional content of FuLL House.
I do.
Besides, I don't know why you're dumping on me.
I'm not the one who sold out my only brother for some girl.
Eric, she said yes!
- Yup.
- Congratulations!
You were in on this?
Come on, Cory, don't you think you're making a big deal about this game?
I don't care about the game.
I don't care about the tickets.
I wouldn't take them if you offered them to me.
All right, look, I'll just take Heather somewhere else.
Here, you want the tickets?
- Yeah!
- Get real!
Dad!
Cory, he paid for those tickets with his own money.
He can take whoever he likes.
But I earned those tickets.
I slept with him for 11 years!
Look, pal, when you're older you'll understand how your brother feels because girls will be important to you, too.
Fine.
My brother betrays me my parents take his side.
Fine.
I don't have a friend in this house.
Do you want me and Debbie to go to the baseball game with you?
Hey, go to the game with my sister and her doll.
Great.
Maybe during the seventh-inning stretch I could run through the stadium in my old Spider-Man underwear.
Well, you don't have to dress up for me.
Well, mine's got fuzz.
Mine's got lips.
Hey, bagman rough life being an only child, huh?
Yeah.
Rougher life being an orphan which is what I am as of last night.
What happened?
I dumped my family, and my family dumped me.
It Was mutual.
They're keeping the house.
Well, we're here for you, Cory.
Thanks.
You're my new brothers.
Hey, how about we go to the game Friday night?
I thought the game was sold out.
It is.
So we go down early.
There's always guys with extra tickets.
Don't you have detention Friday?
Ah, don't worry about detention.
I can handle Feeny.
Feeny loves me.
Feeny hates you.
Well, it's one of the two.
We'll see who's right.
Mr. Feeny, may I sit down?
I'd rather you didn't.
Hates me.
Mr. Matthews, I spend dealing with the perceived problems of whiny little people like yourself.
Now, this is my lunch period, my respite from the fray.
I spend 4 hours with you every morning and 3 hours with you every afternoon.
Now, for God's sake, get out of my face.
Evelyn.
George.
I saved a place for you.
Oh, aren't you sweet?
And who is this young man?
Uh, my name's Cory Matthews.
Mr. Feeny's my teacher.
He hates me.
Now, Cory, I'm sure that Mr. Feeny doesn't hate you.
Oh, good.
Caught you home.
Housewarming gift.
Chocolate pie with a side of barbecued chicken and corn on the cob.
Now, I would've bought you a plant but, hey, you're in a tree.
Thanks, Mom.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
I've been in this tree house a million times.
Never after dark.
Wa ha ha ha!
Cory!
I got to put a moat around this place.
Do you want Debbie to keep you company?
Why would I want your doll to keep me company?
In case you get scared.
Morgan, I'm 11 years old.
I don't get scared.
And even if I did get scared and had to defend myself, my weapon of choice would not be a chick with a plastic head.
Well, you don't have to get so snippy.
Hey America's funniest home teacher.
OK, mister, drop my son's underwear.
Mom, it's me.
How do I know it's you?
Who else would want my underwear?
Good point.
Now, don't get your hopes up.
I'm not moving back in or anything.
Oh, hey, I'm just here straightening up the room for the boy we rented it out to.
Well, I hope he's got better luck with brothers than I did.
You still feeling a little abandoned, Core?
Yeah, well, life goes on.
Yeah, that's what your dad said when it happened to him.
Why?
Who abandoned Dad?
You did.
I never did anything like this to Dad.
Oh, when you were little you couldn't wait for your dad to get home from work so you could throw the football around with him.
I'll tell you something he looked forward to it as much as you did.
So how come we don't do that so much anymore?
Well you got a little older and you had a bunch of friends and you were more interested in throwing the football around with them.
Wait a minute.
It sounds like you're saying I'm the bad guy.
No, honey, there's no bad guy.
All I'm saying is that it's natural that people grow up and priorities change.
oK?
- Mom.
- Hmm?
You were always cordial to me when I lived here.
Thank you, Cory.
And I give you my word that the new boy will never replace you in our hearts.
You're not gonna talk to me at all are you, Mr. Feeny?
Because I've been sitting in this seat for 38 minutes and I've been very good and I think you should let me go.
Look, an cannot sit still this long.
I'm going to get up.
I'm up.
I'm dancing.
I'm leaving.
My hand is on the knob.
The door is open.
Fine.
I'm in the haLL!
Mr. Feeny, this stinks.
It's supposed to stink, Mr. Matthews.
It's detention.
You're being detained from whatever it is you'd rather be doing.
Well, I think it's a cruel and unusual life-sucking torture.
You've captured the essence.
Why do we have to stay here?
Just because I don't want to hear about this love stuff?
Because I know it only leads to no good and I know in your heart you agree with me.
What brings you to that conclusion, Mr. Matthews?
'Cause you and I had dinner together last night.
Really?
I wasn't aware.
I had chocolate pie and you had salad for two all by yourself.
How did you know that?
'Cause I slept in my tree house last night.
You know why?
'Cause this love stuff has turned my whole family against me.
And you're teaching us how it's worth killing yourself for when I know you don't really believe that do you?
Well You shrewd little observer of the human condition.
How blissful it must be for you to have lived so little and yet already reached your conclusions about the greatest wonder of the universe.
Y-you know what, Mr. Feeny?
Keep the radio.
Shakespeare wrote plays and sonnets.
The Greeks wrote tragedies and comedies.
Robert Burns, Emily Dickinson the Brownings examined the depths of human emotions.
And do you know what each one of these poets, playwrights, and philosophers had in common, Mr. Matthews?
They all took your class?
Every one of them was older than 11.
You come into my classroom at the beginning of the year and at the end, you go.
And I really don't know if in the time we spent together I have taught you anything.
Well, this afternoon, Mr. Matthews you are going to learn something from me.
Do I have your attention?
Yes, sir.
I live on the other side of the fence from you, Cory and it's impossible not to face in your direction every once in a while and notice the people in the next yard.
And through the years, I've got to know them.
It is apparent that they are fine individuals but their real strength comes from being a family.
And do you know why they're a family, Cory?
Because at one time a man and a woman realized that they loved each other and pursued the unlimited potential of what may come from that love.
And here you are.
There is no greater aspiration than to have love in our lives, Mr. Matthews.
Romeo knew it and died for it.
Others know it and prepare salads.
And those who don't know it will sit in detention for the rest of their lives.
This particular detention is over.
Do you want to have tea with me?
No.
Morgan I don't want anybody to know I'm here, oK?
Oh, oK.
You're moving back in?
Yeah.
Don't tell anybody.
Oh, oK.
Cory's back!
No!
Shh!
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
Well, it's about time.
Dinner's on the table and the kids have been animals.
Ha ha!
I know that you and Mom will lose out on all that rental income but I want my old room back.
Well, that comes as quite an economic blow but we'll try to get by.
Dad, I'm sorry I dumped you for my friends.
When did you do that?
You know.
All the time.
Well, Cory, I'm glad that you have friends and I'm glad you're back.
- No, don't hug me!
- No, don't hug me!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
Die!
You missed the puppy-looking thing in the corner.
Die!
There's one We Won't have to neuter.
are in the playoffs.
Yeah, I heard.
What do you mean you heard?
You were there.
I really wasn't paying much attention to the game, Cory.
Why not?
It was a great game.
It was not, however, a great date.
You had a bad date?
No, I had a great date.
Heather Was beautiful.
She knew what to say, she knew what to do.
Unfortunately, her date spilled food tripped over chairs, and had nothing interesting to say for nine innings.
Eric, you're much too cool for some girl.
News flash.
I'm not cool.
You don't know what you're talking about.
OK, you're not cool.
And now you know better than to go to a game without your brother.
You're right.
I am?
Yeah.
That's my first and last date with Heather.
I never want to see her again.
Good.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Here.
What's this?
Call her.
- Who?
- Who?
!
Heather, my nemesis!
- Call her.
- Why?
'Cause you're sitting there drooling and pathetic and I know somewhere inside's my cool brother and I'm not gonna get him back unless you call her.
Look, I'm not calling her.
I sat there all night and didn't say anything.
What could I say now?
Take her to a movie.
There you're supposed to sit and not say anything.
A movie's perfect for your current skill level.
Why do you want me to call her?
I'm told love is Worth it.
Aren't you going to invite me to have tea with you?
Morgan, I want you to know something.
No matter how old I get I'm always gonna be your big brother.
Sugar?
And even if I ever which I won't get interested in girls Milk?
And it seems like I don't care about you anymore Ketchup?
I still always want you to invite me to have tea with you.
Morgan, honey, put your tea set away and brush your teeth.
It's time to go to bed.
Do I have to?
You're asking me?
How about if we just stay up and finish our tea?
You volunteering to put your sister to bed?
Yeah, I guess I am.
Why?
'Cause I don't understand anything about my entire life.
Yeah, thanks.
Two days in a row.
She just doesn't learn.
Evelyn, I hope I'm not being forward but instead of cafeteria lunch maybe one evening we could have dinner together?
Of course, George.
I'd love it.
Good.
I'm quite the cook, you know?
Really?
Oh, yes.
Just the other night I prepared a lovely salad nicoise for my sister, but she, uh had to cancel at the last moment.
Confused, Mr. Matthews?
Yes, I am, sir.

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Say you could pick any superhero to be your dad.
- Who would you choose?
- Batman, no question.
Live in a cool cave, borrow the Batmobile.
He lets Robin hang out with him and play with all his stuff.
And Robin's not even his real kid.
- He's his ward.
- How do you get to be a ward?
Batman?
Is he faster than a speeding bullet?
I don't think so.
Is he more powerful than a locomotive?
Uh-uh.
I'd Want Superman.
Sees through walls.
You'd never get away with anything.
Because I'd make somebody a very cool ward.
I'd like to have Superman for a dad.
Hey, there's Minkus.
Ow.
Whoa!
The 2000-X Hydro-Saturator.
Careful.
If Feeny sees this baby on school grounds, he'll shag it and I'll have to sit out the water wars.
Gentlemen, meet the Hydro-Sat 3000-Z.
Blow your head clean off.
The 3000?
That's not even supposed to come out till Christmas.
I know a guy.
You really shouldn't do that.
What, are you going to melt?
No.
I'm going to retaliate.
Go ahead make me Wet.
Wise choice.
Ah, who needs one of those?
For your information, a well-placed water balloon can give you just as much splash for your cash.
Like everyone's gonna have a humongous water gun.
How are you?
Aah!
Aah!
Stop!
I'll get one!
I promise!
Oh, my G I'll get one!
Stop!
I promise!
Mr. Matthews the drinking fountain is not a toy.
Hi, hon.
What's horrible?
Hmm.
The plumbing in the boys' bathroom is leaking again.
I'm on it.
You are an amazing guy.
Hey, Dad, how about some quality time with your son?
I can't.
I'm spending some quality time with your toilet.
But you just got home from work.
Hi, Mom.
Wow, dinner smells terrific and that thing you're wearing is really lovely.
What is that, a dress?
Oh, Cory, what a lovely and sincere compliment and I just know that you wouldn't spoil it by asking me for something.
Eerie how she always knows, huh?
What, do all women have antennas hidden somewhere on their bodies?
I don't know.
None of them Will let me look.
Look.
oK, look, say you're in the kitchen and the living room burst into flames.
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe lightning hit it.
Why?
Because it was attracted by the metal plate in your head.
And you can't escape 'cause your legs are broken.
What will you do?
Why are her legs broken?
Because she tripped over your dead body.
Cory, spit it out.
What do you want?
Just a water gun.
You know so you can put out that fire in the living room.
Fine.
I'll buy you a water gun.
Cool.
Here's the brochure.
Color chart's on the back.
How much do these things cost?
How can you put a price on the safety of your family?
$50?
$49.95 plus tax, but I'll take my chances with the lightning.
Come on, Mom.
You and Dad blow that much money on food every week.
Your bathroom sink doesn't leak now.
Wow, Dad.
You fixed it all by yourself?
Yeah, and your toilet doesn't do that geyser thing anymore, either.
You never cease to amaze me.
How much do you figure you saved on a plumber?
What's he want this time?
A $50 squirt gun.
A $50 squirt gun?
No, really, what's he want?
Dad, we're not talking an ordinary squirt gun.
We're talking the Hydro-Sat 3000-Z.
It's the big boy on the block.
That's nice, Cor.
Pretty steep, though.
Maybe for Christmas.
Hey, great, a water gun in December.
I'll be the little boy spreading pneumonia.
If they can't afford to buy toys for three children why did they have three children?
Leave me alone.
I'm trying to put Heather in my watch.
What?
I can't get it out of video baseball mode.
Hey, how'd you get Mom and Dad to buy that for you?
I bought it for me.
I cashed my first week's paycheck went down to the mall.
Welcome to the wonderful world of stuff.
Mom and Dad just let you buy that?
Yeah, they said it's my money.
I can buy anything I want except that "Buns of Steel" video.
Eric, you know, I'm thinking.
Now that you're raking in the big bucks maybe you'd like to consider this exciting investment opportunity.
Call my broker Shearson, leave me alone.
Big man doesn't even know what time it is.
I do so.
It is 12:00.
See?
I'm not getting any kind of pressure here.
You had to have a house.
Remember the apartment?
Remember before the children?
Before We Were married?
Before We knew each other?
Remember how happy We Were?
Ooh!
ow!
You remember when you knew when I was kidding?
Dad, you busy?
No.
I'm just relaxing with my wrench.
I want a job at the market.
You're too young for a job at the market.
You let Eric be a box boy.
Son, you're young.
Enjoy it.
It doesn't last long.
Well, I could work after school.
Cory, I don't have any openings.
Well, you're the manager.
Fire somebody.
Fire Eric!
Why don't I fire myself and make you manager?
Cool.
What's it pay?
Not enough to keep me out from under the sink or the car or the mortgage payments.
Dad, nobody likes a whiner.
Now, I need a job.
You need to be a kid.
I don't Want to be a kid.
That's too bad, because once it's gone you can never get it back.
I want to be able to afford stuff!
So do I!
Hey, Mr. Feeny.
Whatcha doin'?
Immersing myself in the tranquillity of my rose garden in the vain attempt to offset my evening ahead drudging through two dozen sixth-grade essays on Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven.
" - I think you'll like my paper.
- oh?
What a major freakoid that Ed Poe must have been, huh?
You have no idea how major a freakoid.
So, are you cutting your flowers?
I am pruning my prized eglanteria floribundas a fragile hybrid that I have meticulously cultivated over the past few seasons.
Well, for a small fee I can hack off the rest of that dead stuff.
You stay away from my roses!
Uh, you know, Mr. Feeny, I was thinking.
Autumn's here, and winter's just around the corner.
That's typically the pattern.
And if you give me fifty bucks now I'll shovel your snow all winter.
Payment in advance?
For a task linked to factors as unpredictable as the weather?
Hardly seems fair.
Come on, Mr. Feeny, have some pity.
I've been out of work for eleven years.
Well, I do have some shutters that are in dire need of paint.
Cool.
What's it pay?
Well, I could go as high as, oh, five.
Dollars?
Get a pulse!
Five bucks to paint all those?
$5 apiece, Mr. Matthews.
That's five times two shutters times eight windows.
Five times two times eight.
What's that, like, 58 bucks?
$58 it is.
You are worth every inch of that C-plus I gave you in math.
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
You won't regret it.
Oh, I expect I shall.
Well, Mr. Matthews, I must confess I'm pleasantly surprised.
Your first foray into the work force is a rousing success.
You completed your task ahead of schedule and with a modicum of skill.
Cool.
Does that mean you're giving me a bonus?
Get a pulse.
Good morning, Alan.
George.
Kid did oK, huh?
Oh, yes.
He acquitted himself like a young Earl Scheib.
Three coats, like you said and they don't even stick or anything.
See, Dad, this work stuff is a piece of cake.
Nothing to it.
I may just start up my own business.
Yeah?
Well, don't start printing up those business cards just yet.
Doesn't even stick.
Remarkable.
Well, got to go.
Water war's starting, starting real soon.
Gotta go.
See ya.
I'm gonna be late, aren't I?
You know how you've been talking about maybe redoing the backyard.
Yeah, but now that I look at it I don't think I want to go with this zebra motif.
Well, nobody told me the paint was gonna go through the shutters.
Cory, when you open the shutters in your bedroom does the sunlight go through?
Well, you got me.
I'm an idiot.
No, you're not an idiot.
You're a kid.
I'm a kidiot.
Water war time, Cory.
War!
War brings out the beast in Minkus.
You kids and your water wars.
I'd love to join you but I'm having way too much fun here.
You're bailing on the water war?
To paint a fence?
You say paint a fence.
I say party.
And, by the way, even if you wanted to I wouldn't cut you in on this action.
Why not?
I thought we were friends.
Yeah, how come you're cutting us out?
People, people, am I the only one who read the summer reading list?
Tom Sawyer?
He's sucking you in to do the work for him.
Guys, who are you gonna listen to, me or the banana?
Well, let's see.
The banana says play.
You say work.
We're gonna hang with the big yellow guy.
OK, look, I got seven bucks left after buying my Hydro-Sat and it's yours if you help me paint the fence.
I say we hold out for lunch and that's Mr. Banana to you, bud.
One bunny ear goes around the other bunny ear.
Will you just tie the bow?
I'm late for the market.
Dad's going to kill me!
I don't know how to tie a bow.
So, why did you tell me you did?
'Cause I'm self-confident.
Now they want dessert!
How's work going, man?
Work.
I love work.
Paint the shutters, paint the fence.
You want paper or you want plastic?
Don't drip the paint on the roses.
Don't put the cans on the produce.
I'm with you, man.
I hate being an adult.
Can I have an ice cream?
Another mouth to feed.
What flavor did you bring us?
Vanilla.
They're vanilla with chocolate on the outside just like they've been for 1,000 years!
I really prefer a Heath Bar Crunch.
You do?
Here you are, Minkus.
Crunch on this.
Is it just me, or is he copping an attitude?
I'm beginning to feel unwelcome here.
- Water war?
- Water war.
Hey, come on, come on!
I paid you.
I brought you sandwiches.
I brought you ice cream.
- Yeah, so?
- So I'm gonna sue you!
Fine.
Have your lawyer call my mom.
Fine.
You want something done, you do it yourself.
I don't need them.
I don't need anybody.
Stupid water war.
Water wars are for kids.
Mr. Matthews I sold you my childhood for 58 bucks!
A paint drip, Mr. Matthews an acrylic dribble has appeared on my side of the fence.
I like it.
I don't.
I Want it removed.
You do?
Yes.
Either that, or perhaps you'd care to paint the rest of my side to match the offending spot.
Oh, come now, Mr. Matthews.
I've hardly asked you to descend into the stygian coal shafts of West Virginia with a pickax and a flashlight.
What's something like that pay?
What did you do to my kid, George?
Overwork, stress-related injury.
You know, Alan, when I was a boy my father had a strong puritanical belief in the Work ethic.
He used to work me from sunup to sundown and look how I turned out.
I don't want you working anymore.
Shutter marks still showed after one coat.
Had to borrow from Mom to buy more paint for second coat.
I worked two days, painted sixteen shutters and a fence.
Know how much money I made?
I owe eight bucks.
Welcome to adulthood.
At least you came out of it with this water gun you wanted.
Yeah.
You like it?
So this is the big boy on the block, huh?
Very slick.
Too bad I can't go to the water war to use it.
You can if you run.
Isn't it my responsibility to finish painting the fence?
I think your first responsibility is to stay eleven years old as long as you can.
Hoo hoo, cool.
Go on.
Ahh!
Whew!
The water war to end all water wars.
Both sides are claiming victory.
I'd kill you, but I can't move.
Bagging groceries chasing carts price checks spill on aisle seven!
Oh!
It's a nightmare.
I only worked half a shift today.
I don't know how he does it.
- Who?
- Dad.
Twelve-hour days never sits eats his Lunch standing up never takes a break.
It's Like he's not human.
It's Like he's It's like he's Superman.
Huh?
Superman's my dad.
I know you finished painting the fence for me today, Dad.
That's all right, Cory.
No.
It's not all right.
You work all day, then you come home and work some more, and then you do my work.
You're hogging all the work.
And I'm calling you out.
Huh?
I'm calling you out.
- Cory - Draw.
What are you talking about?
What do you think you're doing?
I think I'm being a kid, Ma!
I think I'm living up to my responsibility of being eleven years old.
Hey, hey!
No, listen, I'm serious!
I've had a very rough day.
We do not shoot water pistols at the dinner table.
You would if you had one.
What?
Go ahead.
Maybe there's a little surprise taped underneath the table for you.
Hey, where'd you get this?
Traded my 3000 for two 1500s.
Cool!
Dad, I know you said you had a rough day and that you only get to be a kid once but I thought it'd be oK if you came back to visit.
Visiting hours are outside in the yard.
No shooting water guns in the house!
Maybe you wouldn't feel that way if you checked under your side of the table.
There's nothing there.
What do you think, I'm made of money?
Don't hit my hair!
Hit his hair!
Yaah!
Yaah!
I don't even have a gun!
Trade the stupid Watch!
Cookies, Morgan?
Sure, I'd love some.
Hello?
Yes.
I'm stuck here, and I can't get down.
My parents are outside fighting.
Listen.
You're drowning my floribundas!
They just shot the neighbor!
Hold on.
Let me ask.
Mommy!
What's our address?
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Hmm bag feels a little light, Dad.
- Chips!
- Chips!
Chocolate chips.
It's good to be men.
Better to be living men.
Come on, Mom.
Manly food.
Come on, Cor.
Momly food.
Humor her.
She washes your underwear.
Aren't you going to cut these sandwiches?
No, no.
When men eat they like to feel a fistful of bread and meat not some crustless little triangle.
Yeah, Mom.
Last time you made us sandwiches all the truckers that passed us laughed and thought we were major nozzles.
I want to go see the Blue Angels.
These aren't angels from heaven, Morgan.
Yeah, these angels are from the Navy.
Me and Dad are gonna watch 'em do formations.
- I want to go with you.
- Ya do?
Cory.
Dad.
You know she can't sit still.
You know she's got an attention span of, like, two seconds.
Morgan?
I got it.
Heather, I'm sorry.
Look, you wear a turtleneck no one's even gonna notice.
OK.
I sucked a neck.
Mrs. Matthews, Leonard Spinelli.
I'm Mr. Matthews' assistant manager.
Lenny, I know who you are.
You've had dinner here maybe twenty times.
Oh, well, I'm just never sure if I really make an impression on people.
Yeah, you do.
I tried phoning, repeatedly.
Did you know call waiting is only pennies a day?
Lenny alert.
Mr. Matthews, I'm very sorry to disturb you at home, especially on a Sunday.
Especially when you're spending time with your family.
Leonard Spinelli.
Lenny, I know who you are.
Oh, really?
Because I'm never really sure if Yeah.
You do.
Lenny, you came here.
I assume there's a point.
Right.
Mr. Matthews, if we move quickly I think we can contain this thing.
Oh, the horror!
Bottom line, Lenny.
Right, right.
oh, boy.
The bottom line is this.
You know that long shelf over the produce department that holds all those cases of Perrier?
Yeah.
- It doesn't do that anymore.
- It fell down?
"Fell down" would be one way of putting it.
Another way would be that the bottles crashed through those produce bins like they were eggshells and sent an imported French tidal wave all the way down aisle six.
What's on aisle six?
of Alka Seltzer.
- Was anybody hurt?
- Hard to say.
Mr. Conklin was still fizzing when I left.
- I got to go.
- Dad Cory, I got to go.
I've got an effervescent produce manager.
Well, you got a warping son.
I'm not spending enough time with my dad.
You step out of this house I'm on my way to my first ballet lesson.
I'll promise you.
I'll make it up to you.
Hey, I promise.
Hey, Cory.
Cory.
Phillies are playing on the west coast and Schilling's going into the seventh inning with a no-hitter against the Dodgers.
You too tired to come down and watch the rest of the game with me?
What, are you new here?
The Phillies got a no-hitter going.
Want to come down watch the game with me and Cory?
I can't.
I'm I'm naked, and I'm taking a math test.
Boy, you never see this on a menu.
They don't know good.
Long fly baLL.
CouLd be the no-hitter.
No!
Dykstra puLLs it back over the waLL.
- I hear ya.
- Mmph!
Thanks for waking me up, Dad.
Hey, wouldn't be this much fun without you.
Uh, don't tell Mom.
Mom's not in on this?
No, no, no.
This is kind of a guy secret.
Well, a father-son bonding.
Your mother can never find out about this.
- Dad?
- Hmm?
This was as good as watching those navy planes any day.
All right, class, time's up.
Please pass your test papers to the front of your rows.
Mr. Minkus, this test didn't require an essay answer but how refreshing that you've chosen to include one.
Ahem.
Suck-up.
Future plumber.
Feels a C-minus short.
Ah, yes.
Here We are.
Huh?
Is the test over?
How'd I do?
- Looks like an "A".
- I got an "A"?
No.
"A" is the only answer you put down before you slipped into the coma.
So, what did I get?
Well, you answered one question out of forty, and got it wrong.
So what grade do you think I'm going to give you?
Can it be found at the beginning of the word "fajita"?
Si.
senor.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
I was up till after midnight.
Oh, and what earth-shattering event kept you up till that time of night?
A no-hitter.
You got to stay up and watch the game?
- With my dad.
- Cool.
Ah, baseball.
Silly me.
I thought you might've stayed up for something frivolous, like the announcement from Stockholm of the Nobel Prizes.
Biophysics Dr. Ira Soochek.
Medicine Dr. Lin Yi Pao.
Economics Professor Narwhal Fowab.
And I'm fresh as a daisy.
- Teacher's pet.
- Fix a sink.
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, Daddy.
I think he was talking to me.
Well, actually, it was a generic "babe" encompassing all of womanhood.
Oh, don't I feel special?
Dad.
Dad!
We blew it.
Hey, I haven't seen you since breakfast.
Whatever it was, you blew it yourself.
I failed a test today just because I fell asleep.
I told Mr. Feeny you and I were up past midnight watching this incredible no-hitter and and then I realized it was probably just an intensely vivid dream.
You kept him up that late on a school night?
Well, it may not have been me.
I think I saw some other father slurking around out there after midnight.
Midnight on a school night?
What were you thinking?
I was thinking that I don't spend enough time with my son.
I was thinking that I promised to make it up to him.
I was thinking I'd go have a talk with Mr. Feeny.
Thank you.
I'll explain it to him, get him to let Cory take a make-up test.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Because until you do, you're grounded.
Does that really work?
Can she ground you?
In certain ways, yes.
All right, Dad.
The Dad-inator.
You're gonna crush Feeny like a grape.
- George.
- Alan.
Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Matthews.
I'd Like to taLk to you about that test my son failed today.
Of course, Alan.
I'm always available to discuss a student's progress or problems with an interested parent.
You see, it was my fault he fell asleep in class.
- I kept him up late last night.
- To watch a baseball game.
A no-hitter!
A piece of Phillies' history.
You know when the last one was?
May 23, 1991.
Tommy Greene.
And do you want to know what happened June 21, 1964?
A perfect game.
Jim Bunning.
And what year did Magellan circumnavigate the globe?
Why would I fill my head with that junk?
Uh George, I had made plans with Cory yesterday and something came up.
I had to cancel.
I promised to make it up to him, so I got him out of bed last night for a little father-son bonding.
I see.
So, can he take a make-up test later this week?
Cory may not take a make-up test.
The "F" stands.
I thought you said you understood.
I believe I do understand, Alan.
But understanding and condoning are two entirely separate concepts.
So you're gonna fail a boy for spending time with his father?
In my 35 years of teaching I have heard every excuse imaginable for why someone fails a test.
What's my excuse if somewhere down the line a child fails at something because I once abrogated my responsibility to impart knowledge?
I've got to listen to this every day.
- House.
- Gone.
Look, I don't understand why you're making a federal case out of this.
Maybe if you were entrusted with the education of 32 sixth-graders every day you would understand what I'm talking about.
And maybe if you had a son and were trying to find time to spend with him in between your job and fixing the car, and insulating the attic you'd understand what I'm talking about.
But you don't have a son, George so how could you understand?
Well, we are obviously on opposite sides of the fence here.
Yes, we are.
Now, this conversation is over.
Aw, Dad.
You got Feened.
Ah, the conquering heroes return.
How did you do?
It was a very difficult conversation.
'Cause Feeny's a butt.
Hey, you don't call your teacher that.
Good teachers are a rare commodity in this world and George Feeny is a great teacher.
Why don't you go upstairs and get some tennis clothes on.
We'll go down to the "Y", hit some balls.
OK.
Feeny's a butt.
Alan.
I know what you're going to say.
No, you don't.
Oh, yes I do.
You're gonna say I'm a jerk for keeping my kid up half the night and then trying to weasel his teacher into making an exception to the rules.
That's not what I was going to say.
OK, what were you going to say?
Forks go on the left.
- That's it?
- No.
I know why you did what you did and I love you for wanting to spend more time with Cory but you can't just jerk his life around to to let yourself off the hook when you don't have time for him.
I'LL get it!
Mr. Matthews?
Leonard Spinelli.
- I work for your father.
- I know that, Lenny.
I see you at the store every day.
Look, you're the assistant manager.
I'm just a boxboy.
Why don't you call me Eric?
That would make me intensely uncomfortable.
I blanch at the thought.
Lenny, was there something you had to tell my dad?
Yes, there was.
Hence, I came here.
He's right in there.
Oh, God!
Hello, Lenny.
Mr. Matthews, I'm very sorry to disturb you at home especially after-hours.
Especially when you're giving mrs.
Matthews mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
- Why are you in my kitchen?
- There's a problem at the store.
Well, of course there's a problem at the store.
There's always a problem at the store.
That's why they hire a manager.
Can you tell me why they hire an assistant manager?
To tell the manager when there's a problem at the store?
No.
To assist the manager by taking care of the problem when he's not there.
I had no idea.
I apologize.
Forget I was here because this is a problem for the assistant manager.
There is no problem for you.
- Dad, you ready?
- Yes, I am.
I'm ready to play tennis with my son and bring him home early let him get a good night's rest, send him off to school and watch those As start rolling in.
And I am going back to the store to make sure we never again put the lighter fluid next to the rotisserie chickens.
Are we talking about a fire, Lenny?
Yeah, but there is no problem for you.
How much of the store is left?
St Cory Dad, it's oK, and you don't have to wake me up or anything later.
We'll play tennis some other time.
Is the fire out, Lenny?
Oh, yeah.
We contained the actual flameage.
Fine.
Wait for me in the car.
Yes, sir.
Miss Matthews, Leonard Spinelli.
I work for your father.
Lenny, we've been through this.
Cory, your mother just said something to me that made a lot of sense.
Don't you hate when she does that?
Yes, I do.
She pointed out to me that I'm angry at the wrong guy about your test.
Well, what other guy is there?
Mr. Feeny's the one who failed me.
No, I failed you.
I didn't do my job.
You're at the store all day.
How could you say you're not doing your job?
I didn't do my job as your father.
What?
Look, if it was up to me you wouldn't have to go to sleep at all.
You wouldn't have to go to school I wouldn't have to go to work and we could just spend all our time together.
And there's nothing that I'd rather do.
Then why don't we do that?
I don't know.
I guess the family's gotten used to eating.
Cory I shouldn't have kept you up late last night.
Mr. Feeny is right.
Uh-oh.
Don't shoot, Mr. Feeny!
I'm just getting my tennis ball!
Good evening, Mr. Matthews.
Care to join me for a drink?
Uh sure.
Help yourself.
Hey!
This is apple juice!
Oh, gee, I must've left it in there too long.
Nice, uh What do you call this thing?
Hmm, a Christmas present from my sister.
She forgets that I only take the occasional glass of claret with dinner.
So, how come you're sitting outside in the dark?
I was thinking about when I was a boy just a little younger than you are.
There was a war going on.
It's hard to picture you as a boy.
Did your parents call you Mr. Feeny?
I used to ask my mother why I could only have butter on my toast two mornings a week and she said, "Because of the war in Europe.
" And I wondered why there was never enough candy and she told me, "Because of the war in Europe.
" oh, and I longed for a pair of sneakers.
But I couldn't have any.
Those Europe guys stole 'em?
No, no.
The rubber had to be diverted to the war effort.
There was a version of a sneaker available but it was made out of recycled tires and left black marks on the gym floor.
Hey, you took gym?
They made me.
Anyway, I prayed every night for an end to the war in Europe.
Not from any altruistic desire for world peace.
Just a boy's selfish wish for buttered toast and sneakers.
Then I heard that Mr. Truman was going on the radio that night to announce the end of the war.
And I went home and asked my father if I could stay up with him to hear the president.
Do you know what he said?
I'm guessing it's either yes or no but we both know how well I do on multiple choice.
He said "Tomorrow's a school day.
"I don't want you up with me.
" So you're saying your dad really knew the value of education.
No, I'm saying my father didn't want me hanging around with him and his drinking buddies.
As a result, the next day at school I was rested and fresh and ready to learn.
I see your point, Mr. Feeny.
No, I don't think you really do, Cory.
What do you suppose I learned in school that day?
I know this has got to be a biggie like the Magna Carta or something.
I have no idea what you learned that day.
Neither do I. You see, Mr. Matthews education is not about obscure facts and little test scores.
Education is about the overall effect of years of slow absorption concepts, philosophies approaches to problem-solving.
The whole process is so grand and all-encompassing that it really can't be threatened by the occasional late-night no-hitter.
It is important that a boy spend time with his father.
But how do you know that?
Your dad didn't let you stay up with him.
That's precisely Why I do know.
Cory!
Over here, Dad having a drink with Mr. Feeny.
It's just apple juice.
How's the store?
Oh, the store is fine.
Just a small grease fire at the rotisserie.
Tomorrow we'll run a special on blackened chicken.
- Alan.
- George.
Better come in, kiddo.
About time for bed.
Sure, Dad.
Um are we ever gonna study that European sneaker war?
I think you'll get to it sometime in the course of your education.
Good, 'cause it sounded really interesting.
Oh, it was.
Well, good night, Mr. Feeny.
Good night, Mr. Matthews.
Ahem.
I, uh just want you to know I'm gonna have him in bed every night when he's supposed to be.
Well, I want you to know that if I did have a son and the opportunity presented itself to wake him up to watch a baseball game or to listen to the president on the radio or for absolutely no reason at all Well good night, Alan.
Good night, George.
Night, Cor.
Have good dreams.
You, too.
Hey, Mom?
Hey, Cor?
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
I'm on the clock for another half hour.
Um well, earlier tonight Dad told me Mr. Feeny was right.
And then later on, Mr. Feeny told me Dad was right.
At least that's what I think he was saying.
Sometimes I can't hold my breathe long enough to get down to where Mr. Feeny likes to swim.
Well, Cor, sometimes two adults can think two different ways about something and both can be right.
Then, how come I only think one way about things and I'm always wrong?
Good night, Cory.
See you tomorrow.
What do you mean, tomorrow?
The Phillies are still in Los Angeles.
What if there's a no-hitter going?
What if the president goes on the radio?
Whatever goes on can wait till tomorrow.
How come?
Because your father is always gonna be there in the morning to tell you about it.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, son.
Am I still grounded?
We'll talk about it.
Hey, talk I can get anywhere.
Hmm?
He won't be back tonight.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
In conclusion, some products we use every day cause algae to grow in lakes cutting off oxygen and disrupting the ecosystem.
So, what we've learned is that we must choose biodegradable products to help protect our environment.
Excellent report.
Inspired visuals.
Next team.
How air pollution affects our everyday life.
Excellent topic.
Denver high atop the majestic Rocky Mountains elevation 5,000 feet.
Philadelphia lying low in the Delaware basin Well researched.
Denver clean crisp mountain air.
Philadelphia polluted industrial smog.
Mile High Stadium home of the Colorado Rockies.
Veterans Stadium home of the Philadelphia Phillies.
Oh, here we go.
The Rockies, a bogus expansion team mind you are averaging four more runs per game than anyone in the league because of their clean air.
Our theory is if Philadelphia would clean up its smoggy air the ball would slice through the atmosphere with a greater velocity.
Therefore the Phillies would score more runs.
And win every home game.
The end.
So, how'd you like our report?
Stinks.
Stinks!
How'd you like my half?
Relax, Mr. Matthews.
I blame myself.
You do?
Cool.
Yes.
I let you choose your own partner.
An astounding lapse of judgment for someone of my experience.
I'm going to let you try again but this time I'll choose the teams.
Mr. Hunter, you'll work with Mr. Minkus.
oh, no.
And Mr. Matthews Yeah, I'll hook up with Mr. Sullivan.
No, no.
That's worse.
You'll work with Miss Lawrence.
Topanga?
Give me your hand.
Why?
I want to see if our energies converge.
Ooh.
He's vibrationally acceptable.
Thanks.
Uh, Mr. Feeny, may I approach the bench?
Objection, Mr. Matthews?
Can you be swayed on this?
I'm Gibraltar.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
Topanga's, like, totally strange.
Strange is in the eye of the beholder, Mr. Matthews.
I, for example have a young neighbor who sings along with his little sister's Barney records.
You hear that?
Why would I want to invite him to my party?
What's wrong with him?
He's gross.
He's a total Brillo head.
What do you think of my hair?
Guys don't ask guys that question.
Well, would this qualify as a Brillo head?
Nah.
You're more like a Nerf head.
You knew this, and you didn't tell me?
You got curly hair.
Big deal.
Can we move on now?
Sure.
It's easy for you to talk.
You got hair.
I'm a Chia pet.
Cory I got Jedidiah to drive me to your house after school.
Who's Jedidiah?
My father.
Wait.
You call your father Jedidiah?
That's his name.
What do you call your father?
Well, like a lot of normal people I refer to him as "Dad.
" Then how do you tell him apart from all the other dads?
Look, Topanga, is there any way we can do this assignment on the phone or by telepathy?
It concerns our environment.
I think it deserves more direct attention.
OK, oK.
I'll see you at my house after school.
Before I leave I'd like you to sign a petition to save Mrs. Rosemead's job.
Who's Mrs. Rosemead?
Our librarian.
They're forcing her to retire.
It's blatant ageism.
Maybe because she's blatantly old.
Look, can we talk about this later?
We're real, real busy here.
Fine.
I'll respect your space.
Wow.
Feeny must really hate your guts.
Could be worse.
At least he didn't give me Minkus.
Hey, Minkus doesn't like me he doesn't trust me, and he doesn't respect me.
So he's doing the whole assignment by himself.
In my book, Stuart Minkus is a god.
Then why is he sitting at the weirdo table?
It's like the cast of "The Addams Family.
" Don't they care what they look like?
Who cares what they look like?
What am I going to do about my hair?
If you're that stressed out I'll ask my sister what she uses to straighten her hair.
Your sister straightens her hair?
Yeah.
If she didn't, it'd look as bad as oh, I don't know, you.
Mommy, if my dolly is cold can I put her in the toaster oven?
No, honey.
That would be a mistake.
- Mommy?
- What?
I made a mistake.
Cory, didn't you smell that?
I just thought we were having plastic for dinner.
I don't care what she looks like.
Debbie's my doll, and I love her.
Well, sweetheart, we'll get you another doll.
OK.
See you later, Amy.
- Amy?
- or if you prefer, Mom.
I told you.
I have some ideas on our presentation.
So do I. Here's what we do.
We hit Feeny hard.
We hit him fast.
The ozone layer it's got a hole.
Wear a hat.
We're in, we're out.
I kind of had a whole different approach to the report.
Less conventional, more performance art.
No, please, let's stick to conventional.
Conventional's good because no one laughs at conventional.
Read this poem out loud.
A poem?
Please, not a poem.
"Sun.
"The only.
"The one.
" "Doughnut in the sky.
"Space.
Big gaping place.
"Without.
Within.
our skin.
"Doughnut in the sky.
"Freon.
"Fluorocarbon.
"Humpback whale.
So pale.
"Exhaust.
Is all lost?
"Doughnut in the sky.
" Yeah, we could do that in front of the class but before we do, will you just please take a huge baseball bat and hit me over the head?
You didn't think it had meaning?
Yeah, it means we'll be laughed out of school.
Why do you care so much what other people think?
When people laugh at you they're depleting their own karmic reservoir.
You're going to be one of those girls who doesn't shave her legs, aren't you?
I haven't decided yet.
Do you actually try to be weird?
I don't think I'm Weird.
I think I'm unique.
Jedidiah and Chloe say that every time you're not true to yourself the earth weeps.
Do they say that in their native Martian?
The earth is crying for you, Cory.
I'd rather have the earth crying than my friends laughing.
People make fun of you, Topanga.
So?
I couldn't take it.
I just want to blend in.
Well, you're sure good at it.
You look like all the other plain-wrapped kids at school except for your red hat.
Hey, I got that on Cap Night.
I had to Wait an hour in line.
Well, if it's important to you then it's beautiful.
Got the stuff.
Use a mirror, babe.
What stuff?
Let me ask you something.
What do you think of my hair?
You think it looks good?
It's beautiful, like a desert tumbleweed.
OK.
Thank you for those thoughts.
Look, Topanga, you want to do this performance thing, you go for it.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Are we all done for today?
Yeah.
Shawn and I have another project we're working on now.
Really?
What is it?
Well, you know how those dolphins get caught in the tuna nets?
Yeah.
It's got nothing to do with that.
So, should this stuff be burning?
Why, is it burning?
No.
I'm just trying to make conversation because we never really get to talk.
- How bad's it burning?
- Call your sister.
Ask her if my ears should feel like throbbing jalapenos.
Hi, Stacey.
It's me.
Listen, Cory wants to know if that stuff you sent over should be burning.
Uh-huh.
Really?
Hurting!
Hurting now!
Stacey wants to know how long it's been burning?
- 40, 45 minutes.
- 45 minutes.
Shawn, I'm going to rip my head off!
Stacey says you should've washed it out 45 minutes ago.
Aah!
Stacey says you shouldn't have left it in so long.
Stacey says why didn't you two idiots read the label?
Oh, thanks, Stace.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Aaah!
I had nothing to do with this.
Cory, what did you do to your beautiful hair?
It Wasn't beautiful.
It looked like Velcro.
Nothing's going to stick to that now, man.
This is your fault.
You got the good hair.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
OK.
We can fix this.
Just not with a comb.
Doesn't really matter, Mom.
His hair's gonna fall out.
Eric, stop it.
What?
I'm just saying.
Kid at school tried the same thing.
Bald as cue ball.
She looks terrible.
I don't like my new dolly.
She's not wearing a pretty dress.
Well, honey, she's a businesswoman.
I mean, this dolly has gone to college has a good job and doesn't need Ken to support her.
Who cares?
I got a head problem here.
Hey, it's Punky Brewster!
That's a hat, right?
Yeah.
Try and take it off.
Cory, what did you do?
I tried to straighten my hair, oK?
With what, shellac?
Dad, you think a little shampoo might No.
You see, the whole principle behind shampoo is that it actually has to touch your hair.
It's completely ineffective if there's a polyurethane force field surrounding your head.
I just hope your hair doesn't fall out.
Alan!
Oh, honey, a guy at work, Mike put this kind of stuff in his hair.
Bald as a cue ball.
OK.
Listen up, family because I admit I didn't know what I was doing when I put this stuff on my head.
And I admit I didn't know what it was going to do to me.
But here's the thing I do know.
I am under no circumstances going to school tomorrow.
Is that clear?
No school for Cory.
School, Cory, no.
All right.
Next up for oral reports Miss Lawrence and Mr. Matthews.
Let's go, Mr. Matthews.
Remove your cap and deliver your report.
I can't remove my cap because our report is on the ozone layer and the cap is part of our UV-protection angle.
No caps in my class.
Mr. Feeny, if there was one shred of humanity in you you'll let me keep this on.
Too many years of sixth graders have bled me of my humanity.
Take off your cap.
Go ahead, laugh.
Your hair looks different.
Why would I laugh?
Over here duck head.
Cory there's a seat for you here.
Tofu?
I only got one signature on our petition.
It's so sad.
How come no one cares about Mrs. Rosemead?
Because she's, like, old.
In Eastern culture old people are valued for their knowledge.
Darren, I've been meaning to ask you something since the fourth grade.
Every day you come to school with a cape.
What's the deal with the cape?
What cape?
Look, could someone else take this for a while?
I'm getting tired of having lima beans and spit wads shot at me all day.
I'll take it.
I'm used to having objects hurled at my head.
No one's going to sign your petition.
Why not?
Because you're weird.
However, I say that respectfully since I am now one of you.
But I know how to get them to sign.
Why should we listen to you?
You didn't even know who Mrs. Rosemead was.
I don't have to know Mrs. Rosemead.
All I have to know is the people who you want to sign the petition.
We know who they are.
They're people like that right over there.
They might as well be a billion miles away.
You don't know a thing about them.
What do they like to do after school?
What do they like to watch on TV?
- "Crossfire"?
- "MacNeil-Lehrer Report.
" I enjoy anything with Angela Lansbury.
All right.
I'll assume those are all actual shows.
They're not watching those.
They're out there watching "Beavis and Butthead.
" Whom?
Exactly my point.
You want to sell your idea, you need to know your buyer.
You got to organize, you got to strategize.
And most of all you need people who aren't you.
Are you proposing to help us?
Yeah, I guess I am.
Why?
Because life is strange, and now so am I. OK.
What I'm doing is I'm just trying to get my hair back to normal.
Sure.
If you say anything I'll find some way to hurt you when I'm older.
Not a word, man.
I mean, it's cool, you know.
Don't worry about it.
Hey!
I own you now.
How much longer are we going to wait for him?
Just a couple more minutes.
He's not going to show.
We were stupid to believe him.
I feel cheap.
I know you people are way too smart and mature to find something as degrading as this funny.
Look, the bell's going to ring any second.
Are we going to help out Mrs. Rosemead or not?
Let's rock 'n' roll.
Remember, hold your ground.
It's Friday afternoon and we are the only roadblock to freedom.
Things could get ugly.
What are you geeks doing?
We're going to miss the bus.
Hey, look.
It's Don King.
OK, look.
Here's the deal.
The school board is forcing Mrs. Rosemead to retire.
Who cares?
It's the weekend.
Come on, you guys.
The woman's been here for 40 years and they're just putting her out to pasture.
Just sign our petition and we'll move.
Move or die.
OK, you can kill us, but think about this.
Mrs. Rosemead's been here for, like, a billion years.
She couldn't care less what we do.
Hey, Larry, tell them how you got out of study hall last week.
I told her I was training for the olympic decathlon.
And she believed you, right?
She bought me a discus.
See?
She'll go for anything.
Now, you know what's going to happen?
They're going to hire someone young to replace her.
And this one's going to have something to prove.
And, my good friends, study hall as we know it is gonna be over forever.
Where's the stupid petition?
- Cafeteria.
- I'm signing.
Wow.
You did great, Cory.
It was kind of cool staring down an angry mob.
I never knew I had it in me.
Sometimes the reluctant warrior is the bravest warrior.
You're not going to, like, kiss me now, are you?
Would it be your first kiss?
Hey, don't come near me.
Because it would be interesting if all your life you remembered that your first kiss happened when you thought you looked weird, wouldn't it?
No, it wouldn't be interesting.
Get away.
Because then you'd know.
It's not what you look like on the outside that matters.
It's what kind of person you are.
You shouldn't kiss somebody you're not married to.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I would have to feel I really knew the person.
And that I liked him.
Good.
Good.
It was my first one, too.
You know, I want to tell you something.
Brillo Head wouldn't have come to your party anyway.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the hair does not make the man.
And I speak from personal experience.
You shouldn't talk about people like that.
Don't flatter yourself, Cory.
We weren't even talking about you.
You called me Brillo Head.
We were talking about my sister's friend Dwayne.
We never talk about you, Cory.
We're not that bored.
I see you got your old hair back.
Yeah.
You like it better that way?
It's just hair.
There's still a seat for you if you want to sit down with us.
I kind of promised the guys I'd have lunch with them today.
Yeah, I understand.
Well, there's always a seat here for you.
Thanks.
Hey, touch football in my backyard after school.
Yeah.
I'll be there.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I have graded last week's geography examination and the highest score was achieved by Minkus.
Was it achieved by Minkus?
Does it go to Minkus?
Minkus, right?
Mr. Minkus.
That's a shock.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Your bonus question was a real stumper.
ow.
Miss owens, excellent.
Mr. Baker, very nice.
Mr. Matthews Well, there it is.
A "C"?
But I actually studied for this test.
Why did I get a "C"?
Let's see.
Where to begin.
Well, for one thing, Mr. Matthews this section of the map is not East Germany.
It's not?
Perhaps you heard of a little incident with the Berlin Wall?
Was that during baseball season?
There is no East Germany anymore.
But the textbook says it's right next to West Germany.
Yes, well, the textbook also says that Alaska and Hawaii will make fine states someday.
Things change, Mr. Matthews.
Unfortunately, the Board of Education doesn't have the funds to keep up.
Then how am I supposed to keep up?
Watch the news.
Pay attention in class.
Look at the mimeographs I give you before you turn them into paper airplanes.
Ow.
What good would it do?
They keep changing geography.
Why can't it be like all the other subjects?
Math Uh, science the Earth always goes around the Sun.
History Lincoln always gets shot in the head.
Lincoln got off easy.
All right, heads up.
In these last few moments of class I want to make an announcement about this year's regional geography tournament.
As some of you may know, for the past five years I have always fielded a champion and I expect to do the same this year.
So, based on his outstanding scholastic achievement I have selected as this year's entrant Minkus.
Have you selected Minkus?
Mr. Minkus.
And this year's first prize will be A Mercator projection pull-down wall map?
No.
Uh This year's winner will be bat boy at the opening game of the World Series.
Ohh.
Did you hear that?
Yeah.
So?
So I'm seeing my dream come true here.
Oh, right.
Like Feeny's going to take you to the geography tournament.
You didn't even know they tore down the Berlitz Wall.
Uh about this geography tournament Yeah?
I think you're making a mistake taking Minkus.
And upon what do you base that bizarre theory?
Well, what's the most important ingredient in winning?
Talent.
Skill.
I want you to stop shaking your head.
The Will to Win.
That's what you need, that's what I got.
This sudden interest in geography wouldn't have anything to do with this year's World Series bat boy prize would it?
No.
No way.
Not even.
Are you kidding?
I'm doing this for you.
You're on a 5-year winning streak and I want to bring the big 6 home to you.
You're sucking up to me.
As hard as I can.
Well, thanks, Mr. Matthews.
Concern like yours gives me full confidence.
In me?
In Minkus.
It's Minkus.
I'm full of confidence in Minkus!
Eric, can you babysit for your brother and sister Friday night?
Nope.
Sorry.
Oh, you misunderstood.
You thought I was asking you a question.
Mom, Aerosmith's Friday.
Oh, you heard about that concert, too?
Yup.
I'm taking Heather Ralston.
Great.
Oh, I'll call a sitter and we'll all drive together.
What do you mean, together?
I mean your dad and I have tickets, too.
Morgan, have you seen the broccoli?
Broccoli?
Broccoli?
Nope.
Mother and when I call you that I'm referring to the generational chasm between us which means you couldn't possibly be going to the same concert as me.
Why not?
Well, you know, Aerosmith's kind of loud for someone your age, Mom.
You should really be listening to Careful.
Aren't Peter, Paul, and Mary blowing wind somewhere?
Mom, have you met my good friend Minkus?
It's nice to meet you, Minkus?
Call my mother.
What?
He's a little nervous, Mrs. Matthews.
We're gonna take him upstairs now.
it's the only Minkus in the book.
What is this broccoli doing in here?
It's hiding the liver.
I'm glad you could come over, Minkus.
Real nice to be here.
Can I go now?
Chill.
I don't understand what that means.
It means that 1 out of every 4 people is a nerd.
So when you look around this room and you don't see one, you're it.
But we can help you change.
Maybe I like how I am.
You like everyone always making fun of you?
No.
You like always being the last one picked for teams?
No.
You like everyone pulling your underwear up your butt all the time?
It's not so bad.
Minkus, let us help you.
We're here for you, man.
It's early in the year.
You can still change your image.
What do I do?
The geography tournament you don't want to do it.
It'll brand you for life.
But I love geography.
I'm drawn by the adventure and exoticism of it.
Hey.
Perhaps you fellows would like to join the Future Cartographers of America Club with me.
Let it go, man.
If I don't do the tournament, will you guys like me?
No.
Then I don't see what's in it for me.
All right, name your price, you little creep.
When you guys play Bombardment could you not aim the ball at my head anymore?
Deal.
What's the point of playing if we can't throw the ball at his head?
Hi.
Who's first?
Dad, you can't go to the Aerosmith concert.
He's afraid it will blow out our hearing aids.
I'm just saying it's unnatural.
I mean can't you guys find your own concert to go to?
I'm sorry I couldn't get tickets for the Neil Sedaka-thon.
Get a clue!
We've been listening to Aerosmith since before you were born.
Oh, come on, get out of here.
Don't kill my first concert, oK?
This isn't your first Aerosmith concert.
Madison Square Garden, 1978.
We were there, you were here.
You ate him?
How old are these Aerosmith guys, anyway like a million?
Yeah, our age.
Row C-C.
Read 'em and Weep.
That's the third row.
These are amazing.
Yeah.
old guys get good seats.
Maybe we can buy him decent seats near us so he can at least see the stage.
I don't want to sit near you guys, oK?
I don't want to be in the same amphitheater as you.
I don't even want to hear the same group as you.
I'll go see if there are any seats left for Eric Clapton.
You want to tell him?
Mr. Feeny, I'm afraid I must tender my resignation from the geography tournament.
Mr. Minkus, I'm aware that the changing geopolitical face of the globe offers a difficult challenge.
I just don't feel that the geography tournament fits in with my new image.
And what, pray tell, would that image be?
Stuart Minkus, regular guy.
Mr. Minkus, I have always thought of you as exceptional.
Now, why would you suddenly settle for regular?
Read average, read mediocre.
Because exceptional people get Bombardment balls thrown at their heads.
And regular guys do the throwing.
I see.
And I can't convince you to postpone your new association with the common man until after the tournament?
No.
I'm seizing the day.
Carpe diem.
Mr. Feeny.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Minkus.
You were the only student I ever had who could locate Thrace on a map of the ancient world.
Ah, that's easy.
Just go north from the Aegean and I know what you're doing, Mr. Feeny and it isn't going to ain't going to work.
I shall miss you, Mr. Minkus.
I only wish I knew how I was going to replace you.
Come on, Mr. Feeny.
I'm the only game in town.
Then, Mr. Matthews, there is no game.
Uh, Mr. Feeny.
I noticed you've left the classroom and turned east.
Towards Europe, don't you know?
Come on, give me a chance.
A chance to what, Mr. Matthews?
To publicly humiliate me?
No.
To win for you.
You've never shown any interest in geography before this.
But I do have an interest in winning the geography tournament.
I can learn anything when I'm interested in it.
Are you saying that you're willing to learn something from me?
Yeah.
And if anyone can teach me, you can.
'Cause that's the kind of teacher you are.
I'm an empty vessel.
How many times have I heard you say that?
I've lost count.
But I'm willing to learn from you.
How many times have you heard me say that?
Well I don't believe I've ever heard those words in that order from you.
All right, Mr. Matthews.
I will take you on.
I shall prep you for the tournament.
I know that your motives are not pure but I hope your quest for the prize will lead you to the temple of knowledge.
Yeah, yeah.
If it's on the way.
Mm-hmm.
I thought we were going to the park?
Come on, man, you're studying too much.
The teachers are starting to notice.
Yeah, they're calling you a good student.
They're saying you have potential.
Wow!
The highest and lowest points in the continental United States are only 50 miles apart Death Valley and Mount Whitney.
I find that extraordinary.
Extraordinary?
He's mutating, man.
Ow.
Hey, dudes.
What's up?
Too Weird for me.
I'm out of here.
Hey, my buds invited me down to the sewer pipes to break bottles.
Want to come?
Minkus, I'm glad you're here.
I need to use your brain.
Sorry, my brain is no longer in service.
I don't want to lose this bat boy gig.
In the old days, things used to be so simple.
You had Russia, you had Moscow one country, one capital.
Now you've got your Latvia, your Estonia, your Ukraine and each one has its own separate capital.
What were these people thinking?
Help me, Minkus.
You're on your own, dude.
Every time I think I'm out they try to suck me back in.
You seem to be holding your own quite nicely.
Thanks.
Last night I watched House of StyLe on MTV.
What do you think?
I think Western civilization is in its decline.
I completely agree.
I'm going to watch Beavis and Butthead now.
So, Mr. Matthews, how goes the studying?
Great.
You know, I'm really getting into it.
Glad to hear it.
I think you're going to make an admirable bat boy.
I hope so but learning all this stuff is pretty fun, too.
Did you know that Hawaii used to be called the Sandwich islands?
Really?
That's fascinating.
We're they named after somebody?
Yes, the Earl of Sandwich.
Sandwich?
You don't suppose yes, he did invent the sandwich.
Isn't that Weird?
Weird, indeed, Mr. Matthews.
- The buckeye state?
- ohio.
- The bluegrass state?
- Kentucky.
- Highest mountain in Africa?
- Kilimanjaro.
Elton John.
Ours.
- Led Zeppelin.
- oh, please.
- Tina Turner.
- My mother's.
Eric, if it bothers you so much that your mother and I are going to this concert why don't you rebel don't go.
Oh, yeah.
I see your game here.
You'd love it if I didn't go to that concert wouldn't you?
Nice try, Dad.
Heather and I are going to that concert.
We're going to be there breathing down your neck.
Are your shoulders tense, Mr. Matthews?
Yeah, they're a little tense.
Then I suggest you go like this You should really relax, Mr. Feeny.
I got a good feeling about this.
Your trophy's in the bag and I'm gonna be handing out bats at the Fall Classic.
Here you are, Mr. Bonds.
Pinch hit for you?
Why, it'd be my pleasure.
Contestant 3 name the indigenous peoples of Tierra deL Fuego.
Who are the Yahgans?
It is unnecessary to phrase your answer in the form of a question.
Sorry.
Contestant 4.
what is the primary export of the Tuamotus?
Are these guys working from a different globe?
I believe that would be copra.
Thank you.
And contestant 5.
to whom do they belong?
To whom does who belong?
The Tuamotus.
Of what country are they a possession?
Did you know that Hawaii used to be called the Sandwich islands which were named after the Earl of Sandwich who discovered peanut butter and jelly?
I'm sorry.
The answer is France.
Oh, sure.
She gets a no brainer "Copra.
" Florida is the southernmost of the United States.
Alaska is the northernmost of the United States.
Puerto Rico is still a territory so is Guam.
What does a bat boy do?
I don't know.
They hand players bats.
Get it, bat boy?
Well, who would want to do that?
Yeah.
What a stupid prize.
What ever happened to the Mercator projection pull-down wall map?
Oh I'm hitting my head.
I'm hitting the northernmost part of my head.
So I try not to look down at row C-C because Heather and I are having a good time, you know?
But I can't help looking.
Are Mom and Dad sitting in row C-C?
No, Mom and Dad are dancing in the aisles.
Come on, Eric, I think your parents are really cool.
Oh, good, I'm the lucky boy with the cool parents.
Your mom was sitting on your dad's shoulders.
It Was adorable.
I don't want adorable parents.
Cory, you want adorable parents?
Nope.
I just want them to make me lunch and pick me up from camp.
Oh, I didn't even tell you the worst thing they did.
What did they do?
Hey!
They wore that.
Hot concert, huh?
Yeah, hot, Dad.
What's the matter?
Didn't you guys have a good time?
I had a good time.
Oh, yeah, I had a good time.
Time of my life!
Come on, Heather.
I'm taking you home.
Eric, what is the problem?
Well, the problem is that I've waited all year to take Heather to the Aerosmith concert.
When I finally do I should be having the time of my life.
But I'm not.
You know why?
No, why?
Cory.
What?
I'm involved.
This is interesting.
Because my parents are having my good time.
In better seats.
Why should our good time get in the way of your good time?
You're my parents!
You're not supposed to have any fun.
You're supposed to sit here and wait for me to get home.
And how come I'm home first?
We had backstage passes.
All right, that's it.
Cory, move over.
I'm sitting next to you in the loser's couch.
You lost that geography thing and I lost my music, my parents my entire generation.
I studied geography for the last 300 hours and I have nothing to show for it.
I had to wait in line all night to get those tickets.
The only thing I have to show for it is Sonny and Cher.
Eric, I'm sorry, and I know it's tough to hear this but your mother and I are at an awkward age.
We're parents, but we're not dead yet.
Fine.
Glad somebody had a good time.
Come on, Heather.
I'm taking you home.
Eric, stop right there.
Sit back in that couch, both of you.
Join me on the couch, Heather?
Cory, upstairs.
Why?
I'm not remotely tired.
Cory.
But suddenly, I'm overcome with fatigue.
Come on, sweetie.
But I want to watch Eric get yelled at.
Lots of opportunities for that.
You know, Dad, it really wouldn't be too cool to start yelling at me in front of my girlfriend.
You know, when I was your age I had a father like the one you want.
But What I Wanted was a father like the one you got.
Live With it.
Did my parents just leave us alone together?
Yeah, I think they just did.
I'm the lucky boy with the cool parents.
Not that cool!
Mr. Minkus I see you've abandoned your MTV look.
Well, nothing against Cindy Crawford but I'm more of a Connie Chung kind of guy.
Well, sometimes a man doesn't know himself until he's walked a mile in another man's humungous pants.
Hey, Minkus.
Who owns the Tuamotus?
France.
Oh.
He would've brought home the big 6, wouldn't he?
Very likely.
Well, I want you to know that I tried my hardest.
Did you?
Do you really feel you gave it your best that you studied as hard as you possibly could?
Yeah, I do.
You know, Mr. Matthews, many believed that geography meant taking their little boat as far as it could go before it fell off the earth.
You have pushed yourself to your farthest latitudes.
And not only did you not topple over the edge but, I believe, together we have charted new territory.
What's this?
That is this week's geography exam.
I got an "A"?
Yes, it's an "A".
Congratulations, Mr. Matthews.
We won.
There are 2 outs and Barry Bonds steps up to the pLate.
The pitcher winds up and Wait.
wait.
wait a minute.
Ed.
It Looks Like the bat boy is running out onto the fieLd!
She seems to be carrying a banner and she's holding it up.
John.
Gosh.
Ed.
what's it say?
It says.
"Get France out of the Tuamotus.
" Where are the Tuamotus.
Ed?
WeLL.
I guess they're in France.
John.
Hey.
you know I always thought the Tuamotus were the indigenous peoples of Tierra deL Fuego.
Oh.
no.
John.
Those are the Yahgansa.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
I have graded your book reports from last Friday and after I pass them out, we'll discuss them.
Ah, Mr. Matthews.
Shall I express my usual disappointment or just ask you to guide my sleigh tonight?
Uh, wrong holiday, Mr. Feeny.
See, Halloween's coming up and I was just test driving my clown nose.
Then I insist you stay in the driver's seat.
Put the nose back on for the rest of the morning.
Mr. Minkus, excellent work as usual.
I particularly enjoyed your haiku on Captain Ahab's obsession with the great white whale.
"The calm blue ocean.
"Sun lights up the monster's eye.
He sees me whale food.
" It works on so many levels.
- Brown-noser.
- Troglodyte.
Mr. Lewis, very good work.
Mr. Matthews, not one of your better efforts.
Mr. Hunter.
Hey, this isn't fair.
Rick and I both got Cs.
How come you tell him he did good work and you tell me it wasn't one of my better efforts?
Would Bozo please come to the center ring?
Mr. Lewis worked very hard to get his C and I respect him for that.
You, on the other hand, waste your efforts on being the class clown.
How come you always pick on me, Mr. Feeny?
How come you never pick on Minkus?
Have you taken a blow to the head, Mr. Matthews?
Stuart Minkus gets nothing but As.
If there was a letter before "A," he would get that.
I guess that's why he gets away with so much.
And just what does he get away with?
Well, how come when I make paper airplanes I get detention, and he doesn't?
I Withdraw the question.
You waited for me?
Am I not your best friend?
You had detention, too, didn't you?
Oh, yeah.
Mrs. Engles nailed me.
How'd you get detention in art?
Well, that's what makes me one of the greats.
Hey.
Check this out, answers to a test.
Shawn.
We can't be looking at test answers.
That's major cheating, detention for life.
No, these aren't for a real test.
They're for that stupid IQ exam we're taking tomorrow.
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at this.
Wow.
The person who knows these answers gets a perfect score.
On a test that doesn't even count for a grade.
- Why bother?
- Are you kidding?
This is my one ticket to get Feeny off my back.
If Feeny thinks I'm a genius he'll treat me just as good as he treats Minkus.
Hey, Cory, do yourself a favor.
Crumple the paper up, throw it away in the trash.
Don't complicate your life.
You know, that makes a lot of sense and if I was a smarter person, I'd probably listen to you except I'm not a smarter person But tomorrow, I'm going to be a genius.
I have in my hands the results of Tuesday's IQ test and one person here deserves special mention.
This person achieved not only the highest score in the class not only the highest score in the school but a score so high as to give rise to the question "Is there, in fact, a ceiling on human intelligence"?
Please, Mr. Feeny, you're embarrassing me.
Mr. Minkus, you came in second.
- Second?
- Uh-huh.
As in the context of not first?
Someone scored higher than I did on the IQ test?
Blew you out of the academic water.
Someone sitting in this very classroom is a junior Kierkegaard.
- A what?
- A great mind, Mr. Matthews just like yours.
I have clearly underrated you, and I bow to your genius.
Come on.
Bravo.
It's no big thing, Mr. Feeny.
On the contrary, Mr. Matthews, it is a big thing.
It is a very big thing.
Uh-oh.
We'll buy your Halloween costume tomorrow, oK?
Shelly Figus' mom is buying Shelly Figus her costume today.
Well, Shelly Figus must have a better mom than you do.
Here's your chance to try a little harder.
Hi, mom.
Hi, weasel.
Eric, can you stay with Morgan for an hour while I show a house?
Sure.
You want to learn how to be a big girl?
Yeah.
Because big girls know how to take out the garbage so their brothers don't have to.
Really?
You'd teach me how to take out the garbage?
- Yep.
- What am I, an idiot?
I want my Halloween costume.
It's no big deal, mom.
I'll help her pick one out.
Oh, would you?
Yeah.
If you could just drop us off at the store I'll have dad pick us up on his way home from work.
Is that oK with you?
I love Eric.
Ready?
Hop on, Weez.
Oh, hi.
Can't talk, mom, lot of homework.
Got to go.
Yeah.
What he said.
- Something terrible?
- oh, yeah.
Absolutely.
Feeny knows.
Somehow he knows, and he's going to get me.
You're wrong.
You think he's just sending a thank you note to my parents?
"Thank you for bringing up your son.
He's a genius.
He's smarter than Captain Kirkaguard.
" What are you doing?
That's a sealed envelope addressed to my parents.
Now they're going to know I opened it.
Corey, do your parents ever write letters to anyone?
Yeah.
And when they do, what do they put the letters in?
Envelopes.
Just like this one.
So we could read the note.
And seal it back up in a new white envelope.
Ha!
I love howWe think.
What's it say?
Uh-oh.
He's bringing in the S.E.A. - What?
- The State Education Authority.
They have special field agents who handle intelligence fraud.
I'm cooked!
I'm cooked, Sean!
For the first time in my life, I'm in real trouble.
Not if I'm making all this up.
- Are you?
- No.
I'm cooked!
Relax.
of course I'm making it up.
He just wants to talk to your parents.
What if he tells them he doesn't think I'm a genius?
Who cares if Feeny doesn't think you're brilliant?
As long as the test says so.
But I'm not, and my parents know I'm not.
Then you'll have to make them think you are.
- How do I do that?
- Get with the program, Cory.
It's Halloween, and this year you're going as a genius.
Well, Cory Matthews is that classical music you're listening to?
Oh, that was just a commercial during the baseball game.
- Oh, selling cellos, were they?
- Yeah, I guess so.
Come on, maestro, we saw you conducting that symphony with your Phillies finger.
It wasn't a symphony, dad.
It was just Beethoven's Piano Concerto in "E" Flat.
Cory, we just came from school, talking to Mr. Feeny.
We know about the IQ test.
- You do?
- We do.
So, what do you know?
Well, we know that you scored very high.
The highest in the history of the school district.
I don't want to be treated any differently.
I Wouldn't think of it.
Cory, your father and I are having a little trouble understanding why your IQ test scores are up here and your report cards are, well, down here.
You know, I've been giving that some thought, too, mom.
I've decided that what you're seeing is the flaw in our public education system.
Yeah, I'm seeing the flaw.
Because the way I see it I didn't fail the system, the system failed me.
That's the way you see it?
What other explanation could there be, dad?
- Mommy!
- Up here, angel face.
I don't know, Cor It's just seems that after I'd like to think I know my own children.
I'm a zombie.
Is my little sister hideous or what?
- Hi, Eric.
- Very gruesome.
Blackout teeth?
Ooh.
That's my little girl.
There were no Cinderella costumes?
Hundreds of them.
And you had to choose axe in the head here?
It Was the last one.
Ooh, nice hanging eyeball.
I wanted Morgan to choose her own costume.
She did choose it, mom.
She wanted to be a zombie.
Eric, 24 hours ago, she didn't know what a zombie was.
The undead are cool.
Shawn, this whole thing is getting out of hand.
Relax.
Everybody thinks you're brilliant.
You should enjoy it.
When it was just Feeny, I could enjoy it.
But now my parents are involved, and I don't like lying to them.
- You don't?
- No.
'Cause it gives me a little rush.
Besides, you didn't tell them you were a genius, Feeny did.
And I didn't tell Feeny I'm a genius.
The test did.
And you didn't ask to take the test.
They gave it to me.
And you wouldn't have even seen the answers - if they didn't give us - Detention.
We're innocent victims.
Nothing we do is actually our fault.
It's good to be kids.
- I don't get it.
- What?
If you're smarter than I am how come you're always trying to copy from my paper?
- Uh - He's not copying, Minkus.
He's just glancing over to admire the work of a fellow genius.
- You are?
- He is.
I am.
Oh, well, that's oK.
In fact, from now on I'll kind of tip my test papers up so you can admire the answers even easier.
- Would you do that?
- No.
Genius envy.
Class, this is Miss Chin.
She'll be with you for the first half hour while I have a word with Mr. Matthews.
Tell my mom I went out like a man.
Mr. Matthews, I brought you down here in case there was anything you cared to say to me.
Uh, about what, Mr. Feeny?
Oh, I don't know.
Sports, the weather the inevitable ramifications of deception.
- I choose sports.
- Too bad.
How come?
Your new school doesn't have any.
You know, for a minute there I thought you said new school.
Ha ha ha!
I did.
One that offers an entire curriculum geared toward students like yourself.
No mindless distractions such as baseball, football, basketball.
Wait a minute.
What do they do for fun?
They study.
- What do they do for exercise?
- They study till they sweat.
No sports teams at all?
Well, they have a highly spirited chess team.
Chess?
You know, Mr. Feeny, I'm thinking as fun as that sounds I feel like the smart kids at that school don't really need me.
You and my friends here need me.
Oh, but we'd be holding you back.
No.
You wouldn't.
Um, I could help you teach a class.
You and I, we'd be like a team.
Two men with I.Q.s working together for the good of all these deserving kids.
No, I think we'll just have to muddle through without you.
The school district is committed to giving gifted children everything they deserve and I think you deserve everything you're going to get.
I don't really think I deserve anything.
Oh, but according to the test, you do.
Mr. Feeny, I'm smart enough to know you don't really think I'm a genius.
Mr. Matthews, it no longer matters what I think.
What matters is you're no longer in my class.
Don't you love Halloween?
No one is what they seem to be.
OK, I'm here.
What's the big emergency?
Hey!
What are you trying to do, kill me?
Kill you?
I'll tell you about killed.
- How about what you did to me?
- What'd I do?
Where are you spending your next recess?
Playground, shooting hoops, playing ball?
So?
So let me tell you what I'm doing.
I'm searching for Bobby Fischer!
What are you talking about?
Geniuses go to a special school.
Did you know that?
You killed me.
I'm going to be in a class full of Minkuses.
Wait a minute.
What am I talking about?
These kids make Minkus look like Fabio.
Wait a minute.
They're putting you in another school?
Yes.
The lady is going to be here in a half an hour and they're going to give me another genius test and then they're going to take me away.
So I just called you up to say good-bye.
Or as geniuses say, good-bye in Latin.
- Hey, idiot.
- What?
- Are you a genius?
- No.
Do you have the answers to this test?
No.
You kind of see where I'm going with this?
You want me to throw the test?
Oh, no, no.
I want you to take the test to the best of your ability.
And no guessing.
I wouldn't want you to stumble onto a right answer.
So, Mrs. Matthews, you're a housewife?
Uh, Amy's a homemaker.
She wrangles three kids, runs this house and still manages to sell real estate quite successfully.
And I understand you work in a grocery store.
Well, Alan is the manager of the largest supermarket in this whole area.
Ah.
Tradesmen are so important and yet so little respected.
Mommy?
Can I have cookies?
No, honey.
It's too close to dinner.
You realize, don't you, that her clothes don't match?
We let her pick out her own clothes.
We feel it encourages Morgan's creativity.
Indeed.
Well, if yours are the genes that have produced our darling Cory then perhaps you've done it again with young Morgan here.
Shall we try a word-association problem?
- OK.
- Maple is to elm as daisy is to Booger?
You may go.
Change your clothes.
Genetics is so hit or miss.
All done.
Why, Cory, most students need at least a full hour for this test.
I'll just get out the answer template.
And that should confirm What we already know.
Hmm - Hmm - Hmm Well, Cory, if I'm to believe the results of this test then your I.Q. would be about that of an average sixth grader.
Yup, that's me.
The lights are on, but nobody's home.
Did you really think you'd get away with it, Cory?
No, I guess I knew I'd be caught from the beginning.
I guess we knew that, too.
- Cory cheated.
- I'm not a genius.
You'd like us to believe that, wouldn't you, Cory?
- Huh?
- Huh?
Your son is manifesting typical behavior for a young genius.
But I'm not smart.
Look at your answer sheet.
It says I'm a moron.
I know it does.
He doesn't want to leave his old school and all his friends.
That is why you cheated on this test, isn't it, Cory?
Yes.
Well, no, but Look, when I said I cheated, I didn't mean this test.
I meant the first test the one Feeny gave us that said I was a genius.
- Cory - No.
Please.
Don't talk.
Every time you talk, you make me sound smart.
Look, mom, dad I found the answers to Feeny's test and memorized them.
I'm not a genius.
We kind of figured that.
You did?
Yeah, but we're glad you finally decided to come clean.
You'll excuse me, but there are actual prodigies out there who deserve my attention and respect.
I can't waste my time with normal people like you.
Well, you'll excuse me, but normal people like us have raised our children to be normal kids.
I'm sorry if they don't fit some arbitrary intellectual standard of yours.
But we're not sorry that they're well brought up and completely normal.
Aah!
Is this better?
She's a zombie.
You got a problem with that?
You must be so proud.
Hmm.
You guys knew I wasn't a genius all along, didn't you?
Yeah, I guess we did.
How come you went along with me?
Well, Cory, we would never accuse you of cheating.
We had no proof that you did.
We just hoped you were smart enough to tell us the truth eventually.
I wasn't even smart enough to do that until I was backed into a corner.
I guess I blew it, huh?
- Yep.
- Grounded?
Yep.
Two weeks.
I'll be in my room.
Yes, you will be, starting the day after Halloween.
You mean I can still have Halloween?
As long as you don't go disguised as a boy who cheats on tests.
I won't.
That costume was totally wrong for me.
Cory, you don't have to ever try to be something you're not.
So from now on, I'll just wear my normal-kid outfit.
It always looked good on you.
Please read chapter seven and be ready to discuss it tomorrow.
Bozo resigns.
I'm turning in my nose.
I figure as long as I'm going to give up being the class genius I'll give up being the class clown, too.
Fair trade.
Welcome back to class, Mr. Matthews.
I guess I thought a guy had to be a genius to earn your respect.
All my students have to do to earn my respect is try their hardest.
I guess that's why you didn't bust Rick Lewis for failing this week's math quiz.
That's right.
He did the best he could.
He just didn't understand the material.
I consider the failure mine, and I will try my hardest to make sure Mr. Lewis understands the next assignment.
Well, I think that's really cool of you, Mr. Feeny.
I'm cool.
God, help me.
My turn, my turn!
Trick or treat!
One for you, one for you, two for me.
Hey, look.
There's the guy that's handing out the rulers.
You're too big to trick or treat.
Yes, well, apparently my treats aren't going over so well.
Uh, would you ask one of your parents if I could borrow some candy?
Mom!
Dad!
Trick or treat!
The candy's on its way.
Hey, aren't you that Feeny guy from school?
I'm Mr. Feeny, yes.
My brother's friend Cory Matthews said I'm going to have you for a teacher next year.
He said you're the best teacher in the whole school.
Oh, please, Mr. Matthews.
I wasn't born yesterda I'm terribly sorry.
Happy Halloween.
Here, have a ruler.
Have all the rulers.
- George.
- Yes?
There's plenty of candy here in the kitchen.
Thank you.
And they say I'm not a genius.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey, guys.
Mmm, collecting snails?
Yeah, Mr. Feeny said we can take 'em off his flowers and use them for bait for when we all go fishing Sunday.
Fish don't eat snails.
Gee, I guess I was mistaken.
Well, whenever you guys are ready the bass master here is all set to pass on to the younger generation some of the finer points of spin casting.
Manipulating young and impressionable minds.
I hope you're proud of yourself, Mr. Feeny.
Indeed I am, Mr. Matthews.
Come on, guys.
Now, the main thing to remember is that basically it's a simple flick of the wrist.
You open the bail hold the line with your finger and then it's 2:00, 10:00.
Kind of a quarter after 3:00 thing you got going on there, Dad, huh?
May a, uh, fellow angler try his luck?
Be my guest, George.
Thank you.
Ha ha!
That fella out there.
It's like getting back on a bicycle.
One never forgets.
Mr. Feeny, you fish?
Oh, sure.
I'm an old bass hog from way back.
I'll never forget that September morn, 1956.
I was after small-mouth bass on the Louisiana Delta.
Sounds fascinating, George.
Spanish moss hanging down and the cypress knees jutting up through the brackish water of the bayou.
Sounds fascinating, George.
Dad, how come Eric's not coming with us this year?
Well, your brother's discovered girls.
He can't sit still.
When you're Eric's age and you can't sit still, I'll take Morgan.
It's the endless cycle of fishing.
And what about after Morgan?
Well, then I'll just be some guy in a fishing hat with a lot of boring stories.
Did you just scare yourself, Dad?
Whoa, yes, I think I did.
Hi.
I'm Morgan, and this is my brother Eric.
He's very shy.
Ha ha ha.
Good girl.
Eric, what are you teaching her?
Nothing.
I get to help Eric meet girls.
No, you don't.
She doesn't.
You don't.
My brother thinks you are so cute.
So this is why you've been taking her to the mall.
- Well, I think it's great.
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ha ha ha.
I think it's a perfect way for you and your sister to spend quality time together.
Well, you know, some guys use a golden retriever.
I figure, why not use the weasel here?
It's Grandma!
Hey, it's Grandma!
Yeah, it's Grandma.
OK, open up a lane.
I'm coming through.
I've been sitting on my keister for ten hours in that Winnebago.
I need some stretching room.
Hey!
Grandma!
Grandma!
Hey!
Where's my present?
I thought this year maybe you'd buy me one.
Nuh-uh.
You're the grandma.
I am?
oh well, in that case Uh-oh, what have we here?
A dolly.
Ha ha.
Well, it's a shrunken head.
Not a real one.
They don't sell real ones in Tijuana.
Not for a buck.
That's a cool bullwhip, Grandma.
Oh, yeah, and it's yours.
I had the wagon master to go with it but he slipped out of the cuffs in Juarez.
I know, I know.
I didn't call.
You never do, Bernice.
Well, it's not my style.
Hey, I got something for you, too.
Yeah.
Dried cactus.
It's from Albuquerque.
An old Navajo tradition.
Keeps you regular as a diesel.
Thanks for preparing us for middle age, Mom.
We'll think of you several times a day.
So, what brings you to our neck of the woods?
Did your convoy swing through?
Yeah, yeah.
We made a killing in bingo country so now we're heading out to Palm Springs to buy ourselves some new butts.
Ha ha ha!
Grandma!
Kiddo!
Finally decided to show your face, huh?
What'd they do, let you out of detention early?
Yeah, well, I heard "La Cucaracha" from all the way down at the park.
How long are you staying?
Oh, just the weekend.
Speaking of which hey, you two kids cancel all your plans for Saturday 'cause, Morgan, you and I are gonna go shopping.
We are gonna buy so many new clothes you won't know what to do with them all.
I'll wear them, then I'll throw them on the floor.
Ha!
Why not?
And then I thought we'd take in the auto show.
I hear they got some pretty hot babes sitting on the hoods of those hotrods.
There's something I might enjoy.
And Sunday, kiddo, you and I we are gonna go get this baseball card signed by the guy in the picture.
Cal Ripken?
This is Cal Ripken's rookie card!
How'd you get this?
How'd I get it?
I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die and then I pried that out of his cold, dead fingers.
Or I bought it for seven bucks at a swap meet.
You make the call.
And we're gonna get him to sign it?
Well, would you like that?
What are you, new?
- Hey!
- Hey!
Oh, man, that was the best auto show ever.
They had Bernie Koppell and Jamie Farr right up there on the same stage.
Where else you gonna get that?
Hey, Cor, check it out.
I had the Lamborghini girl sign my arm.
Lamborghini girl?
Eric, how can you even compare the Lamborghini girl to Cal Ripken?
Has the Lamborghini girl played 1,900 straight games?
No, but has Cal Ripken ever posed For the Victoria's Secret catalogue?
Eric, I feel we're growing apart.
Told her maybe we could take a drive once I get my license.
She laughed, but it was a flirty laugh.
Graziella Terziana.
I think she's French.
Boy, I'm bushed.
What, with chasing your sister in and out of dressing rooms and chasing your brother away from those bikini models' dressing rooms these dogs are barking.
You're not too tired for tomorrow, are you?
Are you kidding?
You and me?
I wouldn't miss that for the world.
Mr. Matthews, just the man I wanted to see.
- Mr. Feeny?
- Let me ask you if one were entertaining a young woman a young girl your age um, how would he go about it?
Mr. Feeny, you dating a teenage girl?
Not since the Eisenhower administration.
No.
My niece is visiting for a few days.
She's your age.
She'll need to be entertained And I thought that maybe you could help me out.
Look, I'd love to meet your niece, Mr. Feeny, But, see, I got this really bad case of strep throat.
It's spreading down my lungs and into my pancreas so, as you can see, I'm I'm completely strep.
Relax.
I'm merely curious as to how a contemporary teenage girl entertains herself.
Oh, oK.
Well, it's my experience that if they can't find a senior with a car they'll settle for some gullible sophomore who's willing to empty his pockets on a dinner he can't really afford a movie he doesn't want to see and a door slammed in his face.
Somewhere in that brimming cup of bile I heard dinner and a movie.
Yeah, see, dinner and a movie is the premier form of dating entertainment.
Dinner, movie.
Movie, dinner.
Dinner, dinner, movie, movie.
A wonderfully rich tapestry of human experience.
Don't mock what I am, Mr. Feeny.
Mom, where's Grandma?
We were supposed to leave ten minutes ago and her Winnebago's not even outside.
You know what, Cor?
I was gonna bake some blueberry muffins.
You want to help me?
- Bake?
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.
There's nothing I'd rather do more.
Oh, wait.
I'm lying.
I'd rather go to Baltimore.
Well, how about just until you leave?
Ohh so how long do you think I could go without taking a shower before my arm gets all gross disgusting?
Is this what's gonna happen to me when my hormones kick in?
Yeah, like I don't have anything else on my mind but girls.
Look, I got a lot of other things on my mind besides girls.
A lot of other things.
There's, like Girl!
Girl!
Right there!
Right there!
Where?
It's Feeny's niece.
She's unbelievable.
I I gotta think.
I gotta think.
I got to take her to a world she's never been to before.
Dinner.
Movie.
Movie.
Dinner.
This has to be perfectly orchestrated, or else Weasel!
OK, weasel, do you remember what we've been practicing?
This is my brother Eric.
He's very shy.
Ha ha.
Perfect.
Look, in exactly one minute I want you to come outside and do what we've been doing at the mall.
How will I know when it's a minute?
OK?
Minute, ding.
Minute, ding.
Minute, ding.
Movie, dinner.
Movie, dinner.
How you doing, Mr. Feeny?
How could I help you in the garden today?
Oh.
Oh, hi.
I'm Eric.
I'm Jessica.
Strep throat cleared up, did it, Mr. Matthews?
Strep throat?
A guy like me?
No.
See, I work out much too hard to ever get strep throat.
So, uh, where would you like me to move this enormously heavy bag of fertilizer?
I hadn't planned on moving it at all.
Let me just effortlessly toss it over here, then.
Hoo-dah!
This is my brother Eric.
He's very shy.
Speaking of fertilizer.
Is this your little sister?
That she is.
I love Eric.
Oh, please.
Jessica you couldn't possibly fall for this line of She is so cute.
And so well-rehearsed.
Eric's taking me to the carnival today.
When did I say that?
Ha ha.
Looks like your parrot has learned a few new words.
Do you want to come with us?
Oh, with us.
To the carnival with us, yes.
Please come With us.
Well, if that's oK with you, Uncle George.
Well, I think the polite thing would be to extend an invitation for me to join you.
Mr. Feeny, would you like to come to the carnival with us?
Oh, thank you so very much for asking but no.
I'd rather have gum surgery.
OK, now, remember to take those out in a couple minutes so they don't stick.
Mom, I kind of got the hang of it in the last four batches.
Is Grandma lost or What?
I don't know, Cor, but, hey you know what?
I was gonna bake a cake next.
You want to help me out?
Look, Mom, I know you're trying to do this to distract me and all but what if something happened to Grandma?
Maybe we should call the police.
- No, I don't think so.
- Why not?
Because I'm sure that she's fine.
Then why isn't she here yet?
Honey, I've known your grandmother for a long time, and there's something you need to understand about her.
I understand that if Grandma's not here yet she must have a very good reason.
She's not coming, is she?
I'm sorry, Cory.
I know this is disappointing.
Eh, it was just a stupid road trip.
I mean, what kind of city is Baltimore, anyway?
An American League city.
Hey, why don't you call Shawn?
See if he wants to go bowling.
- Cool.
I'll drive.
- or I'll drive.
That could work, too.
I'll call my best bud Shawn the one guy I can count on to be there.
Hi, Mrs. Hunter?
It's Cory.
Shawn around?
What do you mean, he's gone fishing?
Did you know your husband's cheating on me with someone else's son?
You forgot to call Shawn.
Good-bye, Mrs. Hunter.
I forgot.
You didn't tell him you weren't going on the fishing trip?
I forgot.
So he still showed up.
I guess he didn't forget.
Now he's out there with my dad drinking root beer, eating potato chips bonding away.
I miss one thing with my dad and he drops me for the first available son.
Where are you going?
I'll be in the tree house.
Hold my calls.
Eric is the best brother in the whoLe worLd.
That's enough, Morgan.
That was so sweet of you to play four hours of skeeball just to win her that giraffe.
Eric's gonna give me his new sunglasses.
No, he's not.
You know, you can really tell a lot about a guy by the way he treats his sister.
Oh, you mean these.
There you go.
Eric is such a good-looking boy.
Yeah, thanks.
Are we all done for the day?
Yes, we're done.
Bye-bye.
She's adorable.
She's not the only one.
Who's Graziella Terziana?
What?
Her name, it's written on your arm.
Uh, that I can't stop every girl who wants to sign my body.
Oh, Mr. Charming.
I could loan you a pen.
And smart, too, Using his little sister as date bait like that.
That obvious, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Heh.
Big mistake?
Did I say that?
So I didn't have to work so hard.
Who said you had to work at all?
Nice night, huh?
Yeah.
Well, we're just, uh, passing through.
Good.
Pass.
Eric, the lipmaster.
Yeah.
Sure.
Look, anybody else, or are we all done here?
Everyone have a great day without me?
How long have you been up there?
Long enough to watch you swap spit with a Feeny.
Well, I'd say the mood is sufficiently killed wouldn't you?
Dead and buried.
I think my little sister's busy tomorrow so it looks like it's just you and me.
I'll bring the pen.
Good night.
Everyone.
Ha ha.
She's related to Feeny?
Niece.
Nice.
Nice?
She's beautiful.
That's the most incredible girl I ever kissed.
Which puts her at the top of a list of what, two?
Look, making out is not a spectator sport.
Ooh What are you doing back from Baltimore so early?
- I didn't go to Baltimore.
- Why not?
'Cause I stayed here all day 'cause Grandma dumped me while my best friend was out Stealing my dad.
Oh, grow up.
I wasn't stealing your father.
- Good night, Shawn.
- Night, Dad.
- So Grandma never showed, huh?
- Nah, she didn't.
You want to talk about it?
Doesn't really seem like there's much to talk about.
Hoo, boy, are you wrong.
Where are you going?
I'm hungry.
Shawn ate everything on the boat except the worms.
He usually likes those.
Uh, I can highly recommend the muffins.
These are a little dry.
Great.
I cook and I slave, and this is the thanks I get.
You made these?
I didn't have anything else to do 'cause Grandma didn't show up.
I've been there.
Wait a minute.
She did this to you?
Hey, pick a category.
You like sports?
Birthdays?
You like rocket ships?
I'll take rocket ships.
All right.
Um one day my class was supposed to go on this field trip to the Franklin Museum of Science to see the "Man in Space" exhibit.
Cool.
Yeah, it would've been, except that Grandma forgot to return the permission slip, so I didn't get to go.
I been there.
Yeah, me, too, and I felt just the way you're feeling now.
- Did you hate her?
- Well, no.
It's kind of hard to hate her, Cory 'cause a couple months later, she woke me up in the middle of the night, she bundles me up throws me in the Winnebago we drive for two days and two nights.
Where'd she take you?
Cape Canaveral.
Mercury 3.
First American in space.
My classmates are back in Philadelphia Looking at it on a little black-and-white TV.
I'm there feeling the heat from the rocket on my face.
Grandma took you all the way to Cape Canaveral?
See, Grandma doesn't show love like other people do but she loves you no matter what you think.
She just shows love in her own way.
And when she's with you, she wants it to be so special that you'll always remember.
I always do remember.
Yeah, so do I. When that rocket took off and the smile on my face was a mile wide and all of America was watching their little TV set I remember that my mother was watching me.
Guess who.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Alan.
You'll never change, will you?
Would you want me to?
- Nope.
- Ha ha ha.
Hey, kiddo, look, I know we were supposed to go to Baltimore today but you'll never believe what came up.
It doesn't matter, Grandma.
Oh, sure it does.
I know you wanted to take me.
I I really did.
Did I tell you that my Cal Ripken card is my favorite one?
It is?
Yeah, and his signature might've messed it up just like that Lamborghini girl messed up Eric's arm.
The next time my convoy swings by here you and I are gonna do something really special.
I can't Wait.
Hi, Grandma, Cor.
Dad, I've been in my room For the last twenty minutes, oK?
Alan, I would appreciate it if you kept your son and his hormones inside the house at least until my niece leaves.
Why, George, what are you talking about?
Eric's been up in his room for - Twenty - Minutes.
Excuse me.
I will not be jerked around.
Oh, well, excuse me but as the matriarch of this family not to mention a card-carrying member of the Kiwanis Club, I can personally vouch for the fact that this fine young man has been up in his room for the past twenty minutes.
And excuse me, Miss Kiwanis, but how could you know that when I just saw you pull up in your Winnebago and run over my mums not forty seconds ago?
Who is this guy?
My teacher.
Does he give you straight As?
- No.
- And why not?
Have you talked to the boy?
OK, teach, you just better kiss The rest of those mums goodbye.
Wait.
Who is that woman?
My grandma.
Don't you just love her?
No, I don't.
Well, I do.
Cal Ripken Jr., rookie year.
I never thought I'd actually get to hold one of these things.
My grandma picked it up at the swap meet for seven bucks.
Seven bucks in dog years.
This baby's worth 150, easy.
- It is?
- Yeah.
Boy, your grandma must really love you.
Yeah.
Or else she shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
You're kidding right?
I'm not sure.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Hey, Cory.
Brought you a great article on Barry Bonds.
Ah, the $43-million man.
Why do they call him that?
Because that's what he's getting paid to play baseball for six years.
If that's what it comes out to, yeah.
He happens to be one of the top guys in baseball.
Well, I happen to think Mr. Feeny is one of the top guys in teaching and he makes about 40,000 a year.
That stinks.
Finally.
Something we agree on.
Yeah.
Feeny ain't worth that kind of money.
You thought I meant he was overpaid?
I meant that Mr. Feeny is grossly and tragically underpaid.
Minkus May I call you Minkus?
Does spelling ever change?
No.
Does history ever change?
Uh-uh.
Does Feeny ever change?
Never.
Know why?
He doesn't have to.
Know why?
'Cause nothing about teaching sixth grade ever changes.
Well, I think you're wrong.
Well, Ithinkl'm right.
I think in about five seconds, Feeny walks in here takes a sip from the drinking fountain flicks his mustache, goes to the coffee machine sees me, and says, "Good morning, Mr. Matthews.
"I trust you've done the homework.
" Every day the same thing.
He's so predictable.
Good morning, Mr. Matthews.
I trust you've done the homework.
Yes, I did, sir.
But my little sister ate it.
You are so predictable.
This Week in Social Studies we'll be talking about prejudice.
Good, 'cause I'm prejudiced against the scungy food in the cafeteria.
We will be discussing black slavery in the American South the Jews in Nazi Germany and several examples of prejudice throughout history.
Tonight your assignment is to read the first 30 pages of that book.
Aw, man, it's a book about some girl.
Mr. Matthews.
I'll read it anyway.
I'll do my homework, really.
I note an escalating tendency for you to make humorous comments about the things I'm teaching, Mr. Matthews.
You are making my job very difficult.
We both know it's not very hard to teach sixth grade so I always thought you secretly liked that I make it a little more challenging.
Oh, so that's it.
My job is easy.
Well, you know, same stuff every year.
The only thing that changes is the students.
You know, I always thought you had the easy job just sitting in class, listening.
Are you kidding?
Thirty-five hours a week in here with you?
Major homework every night?
It never stops, Mr. Feeny.
And want to know what I get for all that?
Five measly bucks a week.
You probably make that in an hour.
Yes, I do.
That's why I can afford that Ferrari in my driveway.
You don't drive a Ferrari.
Oh, right.
It's a Gremlin.
In any event, perhaps I have been underestimating the difficulty of your job as a sixth-grader.
Well, perhaps you have, Mr. Feeny.
- Mmm.
- What?
I could give you a chance to prove your theory.
What do you mean?
Why don't we trade jobs for the rest of the week?
Because you wouldn't do that.
Oh, yes, I would.
You may teach one of my classes until Friday at which point, you will administer a test that I have prepared.
Will I have to take it?
You'll be the teacher, Mr. Matthews.
You'll be having the easy job giving the test.
And if more students than normal pass, you win.
And if more students fail, I win.
So while I'm doing your job, what are you going to do?
Well, since you'll be sitting in my seat I think it's only fair that I should be sitting in yours.
You mean, you'd be, like, my student?
Like yeah.
Yes!
Would you enjoy that?
Yeah, that'd be oK.
And you'd be taking the test, right?
Right.
OK.
Deal.
Just how you said.
No take-backs.
No take-backs.
But why don't we make this experiment a little more interesting?
Hi, Mom.
Hey, Weez.
- Hey, Eric.
- Hi, new girlfriend.
Oh, ignore her.
When she was born the doctor had to pry her little foot out of her big mouth.
Hi, I'm the mom.
It's nice to meet you.
Hi.
My name's Morgan, and I'm 51/2.
Well, my name is Linda, and I'm 153/4.
I like her!
You guys want something to eat?
Sure.
Could you Morgan, honey I could really, really use your help in the kitchen.
You're just going to have to be more independent 'cause I want to stay and talk to Linda.
I tried.
So you think I'm a new girlfriend, do you?
Uh-huh.
Guys, could we talk about, like, anything else?
Are there a lot of old girlfriends?
Billions.
Does anyone else have that real sharp pain behind their eyes?
I know I do.
Well, I don't think I'm a new girlfriend.
Your brother told me that he just wanted to study with me.
Oh, please.
You're going to fall for that one?
Major snackage is now being served in the main dining room.
Come on, it's getting cold.
- It's ice cream.
- Come on, it's getting warm.
So, isn't it about time Morgan got her own apartment?
Whoa!
That bike is fast.
I heard your engine groaning on that last hill, Dad.
Were you two racing?
No, no.
I was just rushing home and Dad happened to see me and tried to catch up.
- Racing.
- Hurrying in a manly fashion.
Now, why were you rushing to get home?
I think you'd hang around school a while and show off your new bike.
I couldn't wait to tell you.
Mr. Feeny and I made a bet that I could teach Social Studies better than he can.
I'm gonna be the teacher for the rest of the week.
Isn't that great?
Cory, you barely manage a C-plus in Social Studies.
How you gonna teach it?
Hey, Mom.
The book does all the teaching.
Feeny's just Vanna White pointing to the letters.
What exactly did you two high rollers bet?
Well, I put up my bike.
What?
I just bought you that bike!
Relax, Dad.
Feeny's the one who's going to lose big.
What did Mr. Feeny put up against your bike his Garden Weasel?
One-fifth of his weekly paycheck 'cause I'm teaching one of his five classes.
And come Friday, I'm rich!
Why does Feeny want that bike?
Oh, Alan, obviously this is one of those Mr. Feeny lesson things.
Well, what if the lesson is "I want that bike"?
Now, I'm really in charge.
You're not going to call the bet off if I do things a teensy bit different from the way you would?
We made a bet, Mr. Matthews.
It's your class.
They are your minds to mold.
Cool!
Good morning, class.
For the rest of the Week I'm going to be your Social Studies teacher.
Mr. Feeny?
What's going on?
Don't ask me.
He's the man in charge.
That's right, Minkus, my boy.
Me.
I'm your new teacher, and my name is Hey Dude.
That all right with you George?
Mi cLase es su cLase.
And you guys know that rule about no baseball caps in class?
History!
Yeah!
Yeah, Topanga.
If we're going to eliminate the cap rule can we also discard the dress code in its entirety?
Why?
You're not thinking about showing up like, naked tomorrow, are you?
ooh!
No.
Although I find nothing shameful about nudity.
I was thinking about wearing garments from cultures more in tune with the goddess.
A sari, perhaps, or a pareo.
Yeah, fine.
As long as you're covered up.
People, people, people.
Are we going to do our Social Studies work today?
Minkus, Minkus, Minkus.
Shut up.
OK, guys, for homework tonight read the first 30 pages in Whatever that book Was that George assigned us yesterday.
But that was the assignment last night.
Minkus!
Not long ago, I was a student myself and I remember that sixth-graders don't always do their homework so this way, everyone gets a second chance.
Excuse me, Mr. Hey Dude, but I did my homework.
Minkus, get a life.
That's your homework assignment.
Get a life.
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Weez.
Hey, Weasel, check it out.
Look what Linda sent for you.
It's beautiful.
What is it?
This is a genuine Japanese lantern.
That was very nice of Linda.
Yeah.
She brought it all the way back from Tokyo and she wants you to have it.
Look, you put it over the lamp you have in your room all the pretty colors will shine through.
I'm gonna try it right now.
- All right.
- How was your day?
I can't talk, Dad.
I got to go call Linda.
Didn't you just leave her house?
That was 10 minutes ago.
I'm the greatest teacher in the history of the universe.
It went that well, huh?
By the end of the day, it was one big class party.
Well, what was Mr. Feeny doing during this party?
Shawn was teaching him how to play poker for gum.
Well, when did you actually teach the lesson?
I told you, Dad.
The teacher doesn't really do anything.
You read the book, you pass the test.
Did you read the book?
I skimmed it.
Well, what was it about?
It was about the Nazis and the Jews a long time ago.
When there was prejudice and stuff.
A long time ago.
Yeah.
The stuff is history, Dad.
Cory, not that I suddenly think your bike is in, like real significant danger here, but could you give me the details of this bet again?
OK.
Based on the way he grades if more students than usual pass the test then I win.
- Based on the way he grades.
- Right.
- How does he grade?
- Huh?
- Does he on a curve?
- Huh?
Feeny's gonna score pretty high, right?
He Wrote the test.
Cory, figure it out.
He grades on the curve.
The higher he scores, the more kids will fail.
What does that mean?
That means your bike is gone.
Look, you have to help me get the class back under control.
Hey, you're the one who let it get out of control.
Well, you're the one playing poker with Feeny.
Lighten up, man.
You're starting to sound like a teacher.
Topanga, What are you doing?
Moving my desk out of the way.
I've decided I'd rather sit on a traditional yoga cushion.
Oh, come on, Minkus, don't tell me you want to sit on a yogurt cushion!
No.
You told me to get a life.
Now I'm going to be as fun as the next guy.
OK.
I know things got a little loose here yesterday but we've got a test day after tomorrow and it's time to get down to business.
Let's start With the roll call.
Lawrence, Topanga.
I'm channeling.
I will only answer to the name OK.
Present, but not all here.
Hunter, Shawn.
Hunter, Shawn.
Out of my face.
I'm stacking the deck.
Hey.
Where's Mr. Feeny?
I mean, George.
Hey, dude.
Sorry I'm late.
I was chillin' with my homies.
I'm in.
Minkus, this is Social Studies.
Stop making those paper turkeys.
They're flamingoes, and quit calling me Minkus.
You call everyone else by their first name so start calling me Stuart.
I see your Juicy Fruit and I raise you a Chiclet.
Still reading that book, huh, Cor?
Just trying to prepare for class.
You know, this teaching stuff isn't as easy as it looks.
It's not, huh?
Nope.
Nobody in class will pay any attention to me.
Well, maybe that's because you tried to be their pal instead of their teacher.
Maybe you need to set yourself apart from the class be more authoritative.
- How do I do that?
- How does Feeny do it?
I don't know.
I never paid attention.
Come on, let's go sit on the couch, all right?
Eric?
I got it, Cor.
Everything is going to be oK, all right?
Eric?
I'll talk to you later, Cor.
It's getting chilly out there.
Linda!
Linda!
What's wrong with Linda?
Some jerk at the mall called her a bad name.
Where?
our mall?
What did he call you?
It's not important, Morgan.
In our mall right here?
Thank you.
A boy at daycare once called me poo-poo head.
Thanks, Morgan.
Mom.
Come on, Morgan.
Let's make some hot cocoa for everybody.
Man, sometimes people can be total idiots.
This happened today?
Hey, Mr. GQ.
Nice neckwear.
Excellent Windsor knot.
Did your mom tie it?
Minkus Stuart, I need your help.
You're the smartest kid in class and maybe if you pay attention to me some of the other kids will.
Why should I help you?
You made fun of Mr. Feeny and said he gets paid too much.
Hey, dude.
Ooh, that suit.
It's not cool.
Class, I'd like to talk to you today about prejudice and how it still exists in today's world.
I didn't even know that till last night when I saw a real smart, totally cool Asian girl crying her eyes out because some idiot at the mall called her a bad name.
My lesson for today is that when people treat other people badly because of their skin color or their religion or where they come from then real smart, totally cool people can really suffer.
Hey, George, this isn't gum.
These are Rolaids.
Deal me out of this one, Mr. Hunter.
What?
Why?
OK.
You win.
I'm a crummy teacher, and I resign.
Hey, Shawn, before your mother got married what was her name again?
Cordini.
Cordini.
So, that would make you a wop, right?
What did you call me?
You heard what I called you.
Did you hear what he called me?
I heard what he called you.
What are you going to do about it?
He's the teacher.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm gonna knock his head off!
What if you couldn't?
What if you couldn't do anything about it?
What?
What if you lived in a country where I could kill you just because of your mom's last name?
Cory, what are you talking about?
A 15-year-old girl is dead!
Doesn't anybody care?
Cory She was real smart and totally cool.
She wrote this book.
Her name Was Anne Frank.
They say she died of typhus but they killed her because her name Was Anne Frank.
Anne Frank was a victim of antisemitism.
Anti-Semitism.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
You have to read this book and you have to pass this test not because of me but because when someone calls someone else a bad name it's not good that just that one person jumps up.
We all have to jump up.
"In spite of everything "I still believe that people are really good at heart.
" So, what's the verdict?
Am I riding the bus to school from now on?
No.
The same number of students passed the test as usual.
It's a draw.
You get to keep your bike.
Good.
You mean some people still failed?
It happens no matter how good a teacher you are.
Sorry to hear that.
I guess I didn't do such a good job.
On the contrary, Mr. Matthews, you did an excellent job.
Mr. Hunter, for instance got a full grade higher than he usually does.
Somehow you must have gotten his attention.
Shawn got a "B"?
Mm-hmm.
At least one guy learned something from me this week.
- TWo.
- TWo?
Who else?
You, Mr. Matthews.
But how do you know?
I didn't even take the test.
You didn't have to.
Do you really think that I could have gotten you to read "The Diary of Anne Frank"?
Even if you did, Mr. Feeny I still wouldn't have understood it without you.
People just don't understand that about us teachers.
That's all right, Mr. Matthews.
In time, one learns to live with the lack of respect unruly students, and minuscule pay.
Rolaid?
Hey, Mom, guess what?
This Saturday night I got a date with a cheerleader.
What happened to Linda?
She was so sweet, and I was really liking her.
Ma, Linda is the cheerleader.
She made the team.
Oh, that's great.
I'm dating a popular girl all because I was smart enough to get in on the ground floor.
Cheerleading is such a great experience for a girl.
You know, I was a cheerleader.
They had them back then?
Yes, back then when the football was made out of a rock.
Let's see, my big cheer was Bo-bo skideeten dooten & LincoLn High.
yay!
& & Itten-bitten ditten-witten & & Bo-bo skideeten dooten & & Which diddly oten-doten & & Bo-bo skideeten dooten & & LincoLn High.
yay!
& Cute.
Thank you.
Dated, unbelievably uncool, but cute.
Mom, cheerleading isn't that rah-rah stuff anymore.
It's cool, you know.
It's it's cutting-edge.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Hey, congratulations.
You made the squad.
Thanks.
I just had my first practice today.
Why don't you show my mom something you learned so at least she knows what's going on nowadays?
- OK, sure.
- Right here.
Come on.
& Bo-bo skideeten dooten & & Adams High.
yay!
& & Itten-bitten witten-ditten & & Bo-bo skideeten doten & & Which biddLy oten-doten & & Bo-bo skideeten doten & & Adams High.

& All right!
Y eah.
So, what do you think?
See, it's it's cutting edge.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
I'm Cory Matthews.
Today on "Eyewitness Cory" a probing expose of the plight of the middle child.
Stay with us.
So.
Mr. and Mrs. Matthews where are we taking youngest chiLd Morgan today?
Hey, Cor, we're going to Stephanie's birthday party.
Doesn't your sister look adorable?
Get a close-up of her new dress.
Excuse me.
ma'am.
did you say new dress?
And is the baby of the family wearing a goLd necklace?
My mommy gave it to me.
Lent it to you.
Party.
necklace.
new dress aLL for your daughter.
yet just Last night your son was imprisoned in his room forbidden to go to the movies with his best friends.
Our daughter didn't dial random numbers in Saskatchewan just to hear people talk Canadian.
Say good-bye to your poor, exploited brother, sweetie.
Bye.
Sorry everybody hates you.
Finally.
the naked truth emerges.
Hey, Cor, do me a favor.
No phone calls, no Home Shopping Network and be careful with my video camera.
Have fun.
There you have it.
All across America, middle children suffering at the hands of suspicious, mistrustful parents.
Aah!
Next week Grounded.
and how to cope with it.
Taxation Without representation.
King George.
We provide the colonists with all their finished manufactured goods.
We deserve remuneration.
General Washington.
Fine.
Keep your goods.
Like we need your stinking British goods.
We're American.
We're independent.
We'll get our goods from Japan.
General, I'm dying for you to elaborate.
What's the point, Mr. Feeny?
We all know we kicked British butt.
Winners and losers aside, General.
If we do not understand history we are doomed to repeat its mistakes.
Oh, who cares about George Washington?
Who cares about King George?
Was every boring guy in history named George?
I meant, every dead boring guy.
Apparently, the past holds no fascination for you.
No.
It's happened.
It's done.
- It's history.
- I'm saying.
Perhaps we should study your history, Mr. Matthews.
I have no history, Mr. Feeny.
I'm eleven.
I'm more interested in my future.
Oh, well, then it might be more interesting for us to look into our futures to see if we can avoid our mistakes before they happen.
I smell an assignment.
I swear, I didn't see it coming.
The assignment for all of you is to create personal histories for yourselves as if you were returning for your 20th high school reunion.
More like a preunion.
Well said, Mr. Minkus.
You are the graduating class of the year 2000.
What is your profession?
Do you have children?
Are those children tormenting their sixth-grade teacher?
Mr. Feeny, would it be oK if I brought my wife?
Oh, come on, Minkus, what's going to marry you?
Topanga.
ooh!
Why, Stuart, I'm flattered that you would consider me as a potential life mate, but I'm not sure I even recognize the institution of marriage.
Trust me, babe, I've seen the future and it's me.
You're going to show up as a tire salesman?
- That's what my dad does.
- So?
I knowWhat to Wear.
I know how to use a pressure gauge.
I can spot a retread from a mile away.
Shawn, you're so boring.
And lazy.
How about you, Larry?
- I got an angle.
- Let's hear it.
I'm going to be a sixth-grade teacher.
Better yet, I'm going to be Feeny.
Why?
Imitation is the sincerest form of butt-kissing.
Wait a minute.
Weren't we supposed to be what we wanted to be?
I mean, you're going to grow up to be your dad and you're going to grow up to be a Feeny clone.
Am I the only one left here with some vision?
What are you going to go as?
Cory Matthews center fielder for the Philadelphia Phillies.
Ha ha ha!
What are you laughing at?
You had 31 errors in Little League last season.
OK, so I didn't play up to my enormous potential.
Come on, guys, let's be what we really want to be.
Are we going to be men or are we going to be men with boring jobs?
We're going to be men!
OK, here's a picture of you I'm willing to part with for you to put on your baseball card.
Boy, Feeny'll be blown away by this future I'm putting together.
Let's see, when you have your 20th high school reunion I'll be 44.
Mom, how can that be possible?
You're already It's possible.
It's not only possible it's the way it's going to be.
Look, Mommy.
That's very pretty, sweetheart.
Where did that come from?
I traded your necklace.
Morgan, that was a gold necklace and this one is plastic.
Can't you see the difference?
Yes.
This one is pretty.
Who did you make this trade with?
Stephanie.
Honey, I'm going to have to call Stephanie's mom and untrade this trade.
But we said, "Black, black, no trades back.
" Hello, Jane?
Hi, it's Amy Matthews.
Look, our daughters did a silly little trade yesterday so I'm sure you'll understand I'll be needing my necklace back.
What do you mean, "Black, black, no trades back"?
Then after my Leveraged buyout of Microsoft I Went public and became the largest software manufacturer in the free world.
Mr. Minkus, taking over a company is no simple task.
It requires proof of assets bank guarantees, countless applications.
Mr. Feeny, who do you think you're dealing with?
A list of my creditors, my loan guarantees and my approval by the Federal Trade Commission.
An "A", Mr. Minkus, for a very well thought out future.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny, and on the personal front my lovely wife Topanga and I just celebrated the birth of our third child, Rainbow Einstein Minkus.
A tire salesman.
I can't believe you came as a tire salesman.
And muffler specialist.
What's with the big gut?
My dad's fat, my uncle's fat, my grandpa's fat.
Let's face it, Cor, I'm going to be fat.
President of the United States.
Very ambitious, Miss Lawrence.
Yes and no.
Not many people want the job anymore.
Oh, why is that?
Well, now that I've disbanded the military and eliminated nuclear weapons the position is not as seductive.
I see.
That's rather an unusual costume for a president, isn't it?
We all wear togas now.
It removes the hostile competition that fashion often creates.
This world of yours seems like quite a peaceful and loving place.
Yes, especially since we moved all men underground and use them just for breeding.
Well, a few moments ago, Mr. Minkus mentioned that you were his lovely wife.
Stuart and I obviously do not see eye-to-eye on our futures.
- We're married.
- You're breeding stock.
I'll take it.
Can I help you, Mr. Williams?
I've come back to the reunion as a beloved teacher not unlike yourself, sir.
Oh, how flattering.
You're following in my footsteps and, look, you've dressed just like me.
Come over here, you little suck up.
Every year someone tries to avoid the assignment with this transparent little ruse.
I didn't mean to be ruse.
Can you tell me the meaning of the word "tenure"?
I can look it up.
- Can you define curriculum?
- I can look it up.
Just as I thought.
You're no teacher.
You're nothing more than a poseur.
Go look it up.
Ready for me?
Yes, I'm ready, Mr. Matthews.
All right.
Center fielder for the Phillies.
Most impressive.
Yeah, my fans seem to think so.
Then you're quite well-known?
Breakfast of me.
How's it feel to be in the presence of a legend?
Well, legends are not born overnight.
You must've been playing for quite a while.
Oh, ever since the 11th grade.
You didn't graduate high school?
High school's kind of a joke when you're pulling down six mil a year.
Six million?
Hurts, doesn't it?
Well, adjusted for inflation that's a paltry sum compared to even the average ballplayer's salary today.
- But I've got investments.
- Such as?
You know, investments.
Buildings.
Buildings with floors and people in them doing stuff.
I'm diversified.
And do you handle these investments yourself?
No.
My guys do that stuff.
Oh, you've got guys?
Lots of guys.
They're in my buildings.
And what percentage of your salary do they charge for their services?
Mr. Feeny, you're dragging me down.
Can't we discuss, like, my batting average?
You're floundering, Mr. Matthews.
No.
I thought this through.
Look, I even made up my own baseball card.
Yet you have no clue as to how your affairs will be managed no education to help you get a clue and no marketable skills after your ball-playing days are over.
But I've got guys.
Well, Mr. Matthews you've made an attempt at this assignment.
You just didn't think it all the way through.
And until you do, I'm going to give you an incomplete.
- An incomplete?
- Mm-hmm.
That's an "I".
That's lower than an "F".
That's down there by "M".
You can't do this.
Why not?
'Cause it's not like you're giving me an incomplete on some dinky quiz.
You threw me out before I even got to first base.
You took away my future.
I'll miss you, Jim, but you should be on the wall of a kid with a future.
What are you doing?
There's nothing out there for me, Eric.
That's great, Cor, but I'm trying to read here, oK?
What's the point?
This is the point.
In three years, I could save up enough to get one of these vintage Mustangs and fill it with cheerleaders.
Ha ha!
Yeah?
How're you gonna pay for the insurance?
What?
I don't know.
Maybe Dad'll help me.
What if Dad can't afford to help you, Eric?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll get another part-time job.
Work two jobs and go to school.
Oh, Eric, Eric, Eric.
You're nothing but a poseur.
Poseur, huh?
Really?
What do you think of this pose?
Hey, guys, you ready for dinner?
No, but I'll do anything to get away from Captain Bummer.
Your mom told me about the assignment.
It wasn't just an assignment, Dad.
It was my future.
I got an incomplete.
I have an incomplete future.
Of course you have an incomplete future.
The future's always incomplete.
When it's complete, people tend to call it the past.
Mine was supposed to be all planned out.
I thought you wanted to be a baseball player?
I do, but that's not enough for Feeny the Dream Crusher.
I don't care what George Feeny says.
You can do anything you put your mind to, Cory, anything.
Maybe I'll give these to Morgan.
She can color in Jim Abbott's uniform.
Dad, when you were a kid did someone tell you that you'd never make it to being the manager of a supermarket?
Well, that wasn't exactly what I dreamed of being.
It's not?
But it's such a cool job.
I wanted to build bridges big ones, like the Ben Franklin.
Then how come you gave that up?
I don't know.
Sometimes, as you get older, your dreams change.
After a while, I dreamed of having a wife and a family and that came true.
You know what I dream of being now?
What?
I dream of being the father of a Phillies center fielder.
Dad, there's another dream you can kiss good-bye.
Hey, not so fast.
I don't give up that easy.
I still think my kid's going to play in the majors.
I used to dream like that, Dad but now I know that sooner or later every dream comes to an end and you got to wake up.
Hello, Jane.
Hi, Stephanie, it's nice to see you again.
Where's Morgan?
- In the kitchen.
- Go ahead, sweetheart.
I'm glad our little disagreement didn't prevent the kids from playing together.
Well, that would be selfish.
Would you like some coffee?
You are not getting the necklace back.
Now, don't misunderstand.
It's not the value of it it's Stephanie's attachment to it.
Oh, I'm sure I do understand and I had no intention of asking for it.
In that case, I'll have some coffee.
- Ha ha ha!
- oK.
Wow, you have neat stuff.
Yes.
Here we have my mommy's double chocolate brownies.
Ooh, brownies!
Not so fast.
And here we have a diamond crown.
Ooh, diamonds.
Hold your horses.
And speaking of horses My Little Pony.
So, do you work?
Oh, no, I don't have to.
My husband's a very successful attorney.
Ahh.
So that's where little Stephanie gets her flair for negotiations.
Mommy, look, diamonds!
Stephanie, where's your dress and your hat and your necklace?
I traded them.
My dress, my hat, my necklace.
You traded them for a plastic tiara?
And a brownie.
And a little pink pony.
No.
I had to give her something else for the pony.
What?
I'll be needing the keys to your car.
Don't misunderstand.
It's not the value of the car it's Morgan's attachment to it.
Look, I'm telling you, she was doing the kissing.
I I was like an innocent bystander.
Yes, I could've walked away but she had me pinned up against the lockers.
I mean - But - Call her back later.
Are you crazy?
I didn't even know who that was.
Shawn, call everyone and get over to my house now.
Jim Abbott's in my kitchen.
Ha ha ha!
Jim Abbott?
Are you out of your mind?
No, I'm totally in my mind.
Yeah, one of the best pitchers in Major League Baseball is in our house.
Ha ha ha!
Guys, somebody here I'd like you to meet.
Cory, Eric.
Wouldn't you like to meet Jim Abbott?
I guess not.
Aah!
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.
How are you doing?
You must be Cory.
I'm whoever you want me to be.
Your dad's told me a lot about you.
He has?
But how did he How did Dad Why are you in my house?
Cory, don't bug the man with a lot of little-boy questions.
So, Jim, why are you in our house?
Well, I heard that Cory here wants to be in the big leagues someday.
Who, me?
Nah, stupid idea.
I gave up on that.
Guys like me don't make it to the majors.
Well, there's a guy I know who has a son who always dreamed of playing in the major leagues until a certain teacher told him that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.
This sounds familiar to me.
Well, it sounded familiar to me, too.
- It did?
- Sure.
One time I had a high school coach who said I should never play in the major leagues and that only made me work 50 times harder.
Really?
You ever go back to that coach and rub it in his face?
Nah, Jim's too cool to do that, aren't you, Jim?
No, actually, I sent him a videotape of my no-hitter.
Cool.
I guess you showed him.
Well, actually, he showed me.
He showed me an application to a place called the University of Michigan.
Why'd he do that?
Well, he was smart enough to know that if I didn't make it to the major leagues someday at least I'd have a major league education.
So you think I can get into the University of Michigan?
I mean, now that I got connections and everything?
I think you'll be all right, Cory.
You got one big thing going for you.
Oh?
You heard about how well I bunt?
Well, that and the fact that you've got a great dad who lets his kids have big dreams and he's also just crazy enough to send a total stranger Gee, you only got 63 of them?
You did that for me, Dad?
But how'd you know he'd show up?
I didn't know.
But a guy can dream, can't he?
Hey, Jim, you mind signing these for these guys?
Sure.
- Me, too!
- I want one, too!
Apparently, I've brought the wrong ball.
Matthews goes back deep.
He's on his horse!
He's at the Wall!
That ball is Gone.
Come on, Mr. Feeny, please.
You know the rules.
You start respecting my property line and I'll start respecting your property.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Feeny, I just want you to know I made up my mind and I'm going to be a baseball player.
Is that so?
Yeah.
Because a friend of my dad's I don't want to drop any names so let's just call him Jim Abbott well, Jim and I and my dad had a little talk and we straightened out my whole future.
You did?
Yep, I'm going to be in the major leagues Mr. Feeny, no matter what you say.
But Jim and my dad and when I say Jim - You mean Jim Abbott.
- I'm saying!
Well, they say that maybe I shouldn't turn pro until after college.
So you've changed your plans and intend to graduate?
Yeah.
'cause I'm going to make a name for myself playing college ball before I turn pro.
Just like Jim did.
Seems like this Abbott fellow had his future very well-planned and worked hard to get where he is.
You have no idea how hard, Mr. Feeny.
Well, you did better than I expected and I guess you deserve something.
Is this your little way of telling me you're changing my incomplete to an "A"?
No.
This is my little way of saying Play ball!
Why do women go on these shows?
You see the guy with the ripped jeans and the tight butt?
- Yeah.
- That's why.
Does it ever bother you that I never built bridges?
What?
I never became an engineer.
Does it bother you?
Once in a while.
You think you married a failure?
You've got a really good job where people respect you.
You have three beautiful children who are fast asleep in their little beds and you have a wife who has absolutely nothing to do for the next half hour.
So what are you saying, hmm?
Mom, Dad.
CouLd you do something interesting?
This kissing stuff is not going to hoLd my audience's attention.
It was holding my attention until the news crew showed up.
Come on.
guys.
This is television.
How about a little action?
Oh, oK.
You want action?
How about a chase scene?
- Give me that camera!
- Cut!
- Give me the camera!
- Cut, cut!
- Give me the camera.
- Cut!
Cut!
Give me the camera.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
"And it was always said of Scrooge "that he knew how to keep Christmas well "if any man alive possessed the knowledge.
"May that be truly said of us, and all of us.
"And so as Tiny Tim observed "God bLess us.
every one.
" And so ends Dickens' masterpiece "A Christmas Carol.
" Wait a minute.
Where's the Grinch?
Yeah.
Isn't the Grinch supposed to show up now and, like, take everything?
How come it's called "A Christmas Carol" anyway?
Yeah.
There was nobody in this story named Carol.
Miss Lawrence, would you please trade places with Mr. Matthews?
All right.
I am a hyperactive, underachieving, 11-year-old boy.
I meant physically.
Oh, well, that takes less of a psychic toll.
Why do I have to move?
We were just giving our view of the book.
Yeah.
I mean, you say literary masterpiece - we say Anh!
- Anh!
Mr. Matthews, I'm less interested in your review than I am that you understand the material.
What, in your opinion, was Mr. Dickens trying to express in his Christmas story?
That if you're a real butthead then neat ghosts will take you to cool places.
Anh!
Fish and sticks.
Two things nature never would've put together.
What'd you get?
Peanut butter and jelly.
Two things nature couldn't keep apart.
Since when did your mom pack you lunch?
I thought you liked fish sticks.
I do, but I think it's cruel how the little fish scream when they rip their sticks off.
May I sit down?
No.
Well, since you're ambivalent.
Ah, Christmas.
Season of togetherness.
Season of brotherhood.
Season of wool.
Nine out of ten Christmas gifts wool.
It doesn't matter if it's shaped like socks or a sweater it's wool and it's itchy.
The gift isn't as important as the thought behind it.
What's the thought behind wool?
This kid doesn't scratch enough?
I agree with Stuart.
Oh, no.
It's a nerd swarm.
Minkus, shut off your geek magnet.
I just think we often lose sight of the true meaning of Christmas in the frenzy of commercialism.
What are you talking about?
How do We knowWhat to ask for if We don't have commercials?
Christmas is the celebration of the winter solstice an ancient tribal ritual whose origins are lost in time.
Yeah, we were just talking about that in the bathroom.
Listen, Topanga, I think I can hear them calling you back into your own dimension.
Oh, yeah.
They're saying "Topanga, get your aura back here.
" "And bring Minkus.
" Ha!
OK.
Christmas tree update.
I think I got my real leather NBA regulation basketball.
Cool.
Major gift.
So major a gift I've been saving up to buy my gift a gift.
What do you get the basketball who has everything?
A $5.00 top of the line imitation nylon net.
You have five bucks?
I've been saving up for a month.
Let's go buy it after school.
No.
Then I tip off my parents that I know what I'm getting.
You are a yuletide master.
Christmas is very delicate.
You screw up wool.
So, what's the update at your house?
Me?
Hey, Bob Stubcheck's Sports World has to send over a truck with all the stuff my dad got me.
He got me, like, everything.
That's great.
Yeah.
My dad totally came through this year.
Speaking of gifts, you haven't yet chipped in your $5.00 for the class present to Mr. Feeny.
- Tomorrow.
- You said that yesterday.
Come on, Shawn don't think of it as $5.00 for Feeny's present.
Think of it as five bucks to make Minkus go away.
Look, Minkus, I just spent my last money on lunch, oK?
I'll give it to you tomorrow.
What?
His mother charged him a packing fee?
Hi.
Hey!
Did you have fun at the mall?
I don't think I'd call it fun.
Well, hi, pumpkin.
I bet you had fun.
Did you get your picture taken with Santa Claus?
Aaah!
I tried to tell you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know that meant "Don't mention Santa.
" What happened?
Well, Morgan was waiting in line to sit on Santa's lap and she was kind of nervous, and there was this elf who looked like a hitman, only meaner.
What?
Did Santa scare her?
No, no.
He was just this nice old man with a jolly red face.
You know, looking back, his face really was too red.
I mean I just thought he was overheated.
Velvet is a fabric that doesn't breathe.
Amy, what happened?
Well, oK, so Morgan climbs up on Santa's lap and he asks her what she wants and she says a Suzie Homemaker oven and then he grabbed his chest, yelled "Rudolph," and fell over.
Are we talking eight reindeer pulling a pine box?
No, no.
I think he's all right.
I mean, the hitman elf gave him CPR while Mrs. Claus called the paramedics.
Alan, it isn't funny!
Morgan thinks she killed Santa Claus.
Well, did you tell her that he's oK?
Of course I did.
I said he was just resting and he'd be fine.
Maybe you can take her to visit him in the hospital.
I really don't think it'll help her to see Santa Claus with a tube stuck up his nose.
Hey.
What's with the weasel?
She locked herself in the bathroom and she's singing & On the first day of Christmas & & I murdered Santa CLaus & I'll go check on her.
ohh!
Hi, Cory.
Hello, son, apple of my eye.
Dad, there's no reaching him when he's taking inventory.
Yes!
A new arrival!
It's Wool.
You know, Cor, when I was a kid Christmas was about appreciating your gifts because they were given with love.
Love, right.
Glad that's over.
OK.
Three new boxes and only one sounds itchy.
I'm going to go tell Shawn.
Whoa.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
To call Shawn.
I don't think it'd be such a good idea to exaggerate about the gifts you're getting.
- I have to just to keep up.
- What do you mean?
I mean, Bob Stubcheck's Sports World has been moved.
It's new location?
Under Shawn's tree.
I think Shawn may have been exaggerating a little bit.
Dad, it's Christmas.
You're supposed to exaggerate.
I'm gonna tell him I got five new presents under the tree.
You know, I don't think Shawn's gonna be having much of a Christmas this year.
Why not?
Shawn's dad got laid off.
Shawn's dad lost his job?
Yeah.
I guess he was just too embarrassed to tell you.
But I'm his best friend.
So that's why his mom's packing his lunch.
Shawn's not getting anything for Christmas just like Tiny Tim in that story about Carol.
I don't think it's quite that bad.
Dad, can I give him one of the presents under the tree so at least he has something?
That'd be really nice, Cor.
OK.
How about one of Eric's?
& We wish you a merry Christmas & & We wish you a merry Christmas & & We wish you a merry Christmas & Morgan, if you come out I'll let you play with my makeup.
& And a happy new year & Morgan, come out.
Santa's fine.
No.
he's not.
Well, then how come he just called me on the phone?
He did?
Yep.
What did he say?
He said, "Ho ho h ohh!
ohh"!
Stop it.
What?
He said you've been a very, very good girl and I should give you something really special.
Like what?
Whatever you tell her, she's gonna want it the second you open that door.
How about my new flannel shirt that you like so much?
OK.
Ta-da!
What?
For you.
What is it?
Open it.
For you from me.
It's not going to blow up, is it?
Open it!
open it!
Here.
Let me open it.
A real leather NBA certified dribbles like a dream basketball!
I'm giving it to you.
Don't you love me?
Why'd you give this to me?
Because it's Christmas.
So?
We never give each other stuff for Christmas.
Yeah, but this year's kind of different.
Why?
Well because.
Because why?
Because you're my best friend.
But I wasn't last year.
No, you were, it's just Cory, best friends don't lie to each other.
OK.
Look, Shawn, I gave you this because I didn't think you'd be getting that many gifts this year.
Hey, I told you.
I'm getting a ton of stuff.
I don't need a basketball.
My dad already got me two.
Look, Shawn, best friends don't lie to each other.
What are you talking about?
I know about your dad getting laid off.
- Says who?
- Says my dad.
Oh, so what'd you do, go tell everyone?
No.
I didn't tell anyone.
Look, Shawn, I'm trying to give you a nice gift so you don't have a Tiny Tim Christmas and you're acting like you're mad at me.
Oh, so I'm supposed to be all happy that you gave me some bogus gift?
That's not a bogus gift.
That's a totally major gift.
It was my best gift and I was nice enough to give it to you.
Yeah.
Well, keep it.
I don't want your basketball.
Wouldn't you rather have something for Christmas than nothing at all?
I'd rather have nothing for Christmas than your lousy charity.
Hey, Shawn, Christmas is about charity.
You should be thanking me!
Boy, where's his Christmas spirit?
Where's his gratitude?
I can name one sixth grader who wasn't paying attention to "A Christmas Carol.
" I can name one, too, Mr. Matthews.
- Yeah, Shawn.
- Cory.
Ha ha!
No, I'm Cory.
You've been calling me Mr. Matthews for so long you must've forgot.
Believe me, I know who you are.
I also know that a true gift is given with no expectation.
What's that mean?
It means you gave the gift to get the thanks.
I gave the guy my official NBA genuine leather basketball and he threw it back in my face.
What kind of friend is that?
You know what I like most about Christmas?
I go away for a week?
Yeah, that's pretty special.
But it's the time of year that you can think back and appreciate the real gifts you received.
I don't get it.
Friendship, for example, is a real gift.
And it's given with no expectation and no gratitude is necessary.
Not between real friends.
You think about that.
We finally got Morgan out of the bathroom.
- Great.
How'd you do it?
- Psychology.
And bribery.
What happened to that mean elf?
Oh, he went back to the North Pole with Santa.
I think he Was mad at me.
No.
He wasn't mad at you.
Then how come he called me a demon child?
Well, he's gone now and you don't ever have to worry about him ever, ever again.
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.
Aaah!
- Mr. Matthews?
- Yeah?
I'm the elf.
No kidding.
I came to return your wife's money.
She paid for a picture with Santa.
She never got it.
Uh, excuse me.
You called my little girl a demon child?
Hey, all I know is one minute Santa's all jolly, jingling his bells the next minute, your kid sits on his lap ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom!
Heart attack.
Coincidence?
I don't think so.
Yeah?
Merry stinking Christmas to you.
too.
paL!
Shawn, it's tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the class present.
You still haven't paid your $5.00.
Fine, I'll give it to you.
I just don't have it on me.
I'm going to buy the present tonight so today is the last day to give me the money.
I said I'll give it to you.
If you don't give me $5.00 right now I'm not going to put your name on the card and the entire sixth grade of Jefferson Elementary is going to know you're a deadbeat.
Fine, then I am.
oK?
Minkus, leave him alone.
He doesn't have the money.
- He doesn't?
- No.
Oh.
That puts me in an awkward position.
I can't put his name on the card if he doesn't give me the money.
Rules are rules.
I'm the class treasurer, an elected official.
They could subpoena my diaries.
Um, look a couple weeks ago, Shawn lent me five bucks and I never paid him back.
That's why he doesn't have the money.
Oh, so you're the deadbeat.
Yeah.
But I've got it now, so here it is.
Just make sure you put Shawn's name on the card, oK?
Don't worry.
His name, however will have to be last since he was the last one to pay.
Gee, Minkus, I wonder whose name is first on the list?
Does it rhyme with stinkus?
I hope our reading "A Christmas Carol" has interested all of you in reading other works by Charles Dickens.
No, but I will watch the David Copperfield special.
Mr. Minkus.
In my capacity as class treasurer I Would like to present you with the sixth grade's Christmas gift.
Oh, my.
Well ooh, it has the lovely heft of a thick book.
You cunning bibliophile, you.
Oh, my!
A dictionary.
How wonderful.
"To our admired and respected teacher "from his dutiful and attentive class.
" I Wrote that.
I never would've guessed.
And all our names are written below.
Yes.
Minkus all the way down to Hunter.
You all seem to be there.
Well, I am very touched.
This means a great deal to me.
So thank you very much.
Merry Christmas!
Have a wonderful vacation.
Hurry!
Get out while you can!
Hurry!
Don't forget to read two books from the reading list.
Nobody heard that.
Hey, Minkus.
Thanks for putting my name on the card.
Don't thank me.
Your deadbeat friend finally paid back the money he owed you.
What?
It's oK.
You don't have to cover for him anymore.
He told me how you lent him $5.00 and he didn't give it back.
Cory told you that?
Yep, and he handed me five bucks.
He gave you his $5.00?
I guess his conscience finally got the better of him.
Hey, Minkus.
Merry Christmas.
Really?
Merry Christmas to you, too.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You know, I was cleaning up my garage and I found something you might like.
A net!
It belonged to my dad.
It's real old so it might not be genuine imitation nylon.
Whoa, if it's that old, it could be actual nylon!
It's yours.
Cool.
Thanks.
Figure this way, you got the net and I got the ball.
What ball?
You gave that to me.
I think I remember you throwing this back in my face.
So every time you miss a pass, we're not gonna be friends?
You want this ball you're gonna have to take it from me, aren't you?
Nice try.
Think you can steal it from me?
Yeah.
Hey, I did it.
Nah.
I let you have it.
It was charity.
It's Christmas.
Not in the house.
You guys are playing with that so much I'm afraid you're going to wear a hole in it.
Who cares?
It's his ball.
Close the door, please.
You guys ready for supper?
Shawn, I've got plenty.
If you want to stay, I could call your mom.
Thanks, Mrs. Matthews, but we're stringing up the lights tonight and I want to be with my dad.
OK.
Well, before you go, I want you to take these Christmas cookies to your mom.
I helped make them.
Yeah.
Careful when you bite into them.
One of Barbie's little plastic shoes is missing.
Merry Christmas, you guys.
Merry Christmas.
Shawn.
- Hoops here tomorrow?
- Do I have a choice?
You're the only guy on the block with a net.
Shawn, you going to be oK?
Hey, when I got friends, I can get through anything.
Oh, wow, somebody's at the back door.
Wow, I wonder who that could be at the back door.
I have no clue.
- I forgot my line.
- Maybe Morgan oh, yeah!
Maybe Morgan should go get the back door.
I'm not answering any more doors.
Well, I think you're going to want to answer this one.
It's Santa!
Look, everybody, he's alive!
Well, aren't you going to let him in?
Hello, Morgan.
I am Santa.
And I've just returned from the North Pole where I was just resting.
Santa, are you feeling better?
Oh, yes, my dear.
As it turns out Mrs. Claus merely undercooked my figgy pudding.
I'm going to get the camera.
Well, now, little Morgan tell Santa what you want for Christmas.
Good grades for your big brother.
Ho ho ho.
OK, everybody, gather round for a picture.
Santa in the middle.
Mommy, why does Santa look like Mr. Feeny?
& jingle beLLs.
Batman smells & & Robin Laid an egg & & BatmobiLe Lost its wheeL & & Commissioner broke his Leg.
oh & Who taught you that?
- Cory.
- Well, he taught you wrong.
It goes like this.
& jingle beLLs.
jingle beLLs & & jingle aLL the way & & Oh.
what fun it is to ride & & In a one horse open sleigh.
hey & Boring.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Good morning, pumpkin.
I've been up since 6:00!
Nice mess.
It's my biggest.
Friday.
I love Friday.
Soon I'm gonna be home for the whole weekend.
Friday.
I hate Friday.
Soon you're gonna be home for the whole weekend.
- Oh, you love me.
- oh, you wish.
Ahh, good morning.
Let me give you a weekend weather update.
Whether or not I have a date with Cindy this weekend depends on how partly cool I am in school today.
There is a definite Vicki front moving in this Saturday and temperatures are expected to rise.
Cooling off by 10:00, when you're expected to be home.
Oh, Mom, we both know how unpredictable the weather can be.
Don't mess With Mother Nature.
I'll be home by 10:00.
Hey, Mom, where's my blue sugar moons?
Where's my marshmallow teddy bears?
This cereal's bogus.
It's full of hamster food and corn flake dust.
Where's all the good stuff?
Morgan?
She took out all the good stuff.
I've been up since 6:00!
Morgan, all this is is sugar-coated sugar.
I'm feeling very perky.
Why don't we go up to your room, honey?
How come?
How come?
How come?
How come?
How come?
Because if we leave right away we might make it to your bed before the coma.
Coma?
Coma?
Coma, coma, coma.
I've been up since 6:00!
Can't hold your sugar, you shouldn't do breakfast.
Don't waste this, honey.
Have her paint the house.
Hey, Dad.
Good morning, Cory.
Hi, Eric.
Hello, Brooks Robinson deep pocket Fielder's Choice model.
How are you feeling today, all warm and broken in?
You know, Dad, most people put their gloves under the mattress to break them in.
Well, most people don't have a glove that they broke in See, now, with this baby, you baste it with Glovolium and you bake it in a slow oven till the web's ready to snap shut on any line drive that comes near third base tomorrow.
The father/son softball game.
Has it been a year already?
Can you believe it?
- Uh-uh.
- No.
Who are you playing this year, Dad?
Me?
It's not about me playing.
It's us.
The game's nothing without you guys.
Hey, that's nice.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah, that's nice.
You'll be thrilled to know that the Market Giant Juggernaut is gonna steamroll over the Unicorn Rainbow Bookstore.
What, that new-age place?
Yeah.
Why don't they just give us the trophy?
I mean, these guys are much too zen for baseball.
I mean, these are people with inner peace and spiritual tranquillity.
Let's kill 'em.
The father/son softball game.
Has it been a year already?
Can you believe it?
- Uh-uh.
- No.
And to the republic for which it stands one nation, under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
Miss Lawrence, I couldn't help noticing that you didn't recite the Pledge of Allegiance this morning.
Yes, sir.
I elected not to.
Why was that?
I didn't feel like it.
This is gonna be cool.
What was that, Mr. Matthews?
Uh, I said, this is gonna be cool, Mr. Feeny.
Why?
'Cause you're finally gonna nail Topanga for being weird.
Do you think it's weird to engage in social protest?
I think it's weird to pick on me when she didn't say the pledge of allegiance.
Well, Mr. Matthews it seems that you and Miss Lawrence have opposing positions for this morning's debate.
Uh-oh.
You been set up, bud.
Mr. Feeny told you not to say the pledge?
Ohh.
Today's social studies discussions American traditions the Pledge of Allegiance versus social protest.
Mr. Matthews, defend old Glory.
Miss Lawrence, defend the right to dissent.
Just because it's a tradition doesn't mean you have to do it.
But it's the Pledge of Allegiance.
It takes, like, ten seconds to say.
Why can't you just say it and make everyone happy?
Because if I'm forced to do it just because it's some tradition I don't understand then it doesn't make me happy.
Can you spell peculiar?
Oh, and you're normal?
You talk to a flag every day and you don't even know what you're saying.
But I do it.
I do it because I'm supposed to do it.
And that's what makes me a great American.
That's what makes this country great.
That flag.
Because that flag gives us the right to have this discussion.
And this discussion is the most important discussion we will ever have, and Out of here!
Parents don't understand how important the weekend is, you know?
Yeah.
Like there's not enough pressure on us being in the sixth grade all week.
And then they want us to do stuff on our only days off.
Only three days till Monday.
Minkus, I'm sure that if you check your ticket stub you'll see that your seat is in the goon section.
I'm just leaving my tray here while I get an apple, oK?
I mean, my weekends are jam-packed.
I have no spare time.
Minkus left his hamburger here.
I get up saturday morning and I watch "X-Men.
" It's very hard for me to be alone with Minkus's hamburger.
My next stop is the comic book store.
Especially when it's just sitting there begging for more salt.
Then in the afternoon, I hang with you.
I don't know if this is a personality disorder with me or what.
Then it's home for Saturday night pizza night.
But I'm just never happy unless I'm doing stuff like this.
And then it's four hours of video games and it's a good night.
I don't mean just a little happy.
Where's a spare minute?
I mean I'll have this moment and know it was a good day.
I can't take the pressure of a father/son softball game.
Oh, I hate those.
They take it so seriously.
I know.
My dad always screams and yells like it's the most important thing in the world.
And they always get injured.
To us it's only a game.
To them it's a guest shot on "Rescue 911".
The trouble With fathers is they sometimes try to live vicariously through their children.
OK, Minkus.
That's enough quality time.
Take your little hamburger and go to your table.
Hey, did you do anything to my hamburger?
Yeah.
Sure.
Like doing something to his hamburger gives me my jollies.
Look, guys.
Shaquille o'Neal.
ooh, where?
Gee, I guess we just missed him.
Hey, Minkus, isn't that Stephen Hawking?
Where?
Oh, darn.
I missed him, too.
Well, see ya.
Why do they think he's so much smarter than us?
Because he is, isn't he?
He's out there practicing for tomorrow.
- We're trapped.
- What are we gonna do?
There's no way out.
Out of what?
That's Mom.
Yes, it is.
We're gonna have to tell her.
Yes, we are.
Mom, we don't want to play in the father/son softball game.
Why is this my problem?
Look, I think what my-less-than-tactful little brother is trying to say is that these father/son softball games are Not real exciting for you.
- Right.
- Right.
So you understand what we're saying.
I understand that neither one of you is willing to give up a couple of hours on a Saturday For something your father's really looking forward to doing.
I'm really looking forward to my date with Vicki tomorrow.
I mean, why should I give that up?
Hey, Mom, why don't you play?
Yeah.
Look, if this was a husband/wife softball game believe me, I'd be there.
But it's not, thank God.
It's a father/son game.
Look, we're just asking you to get us off the hook.
No.
This is your hook and you're gonna hang on it like the worms you are.
Mom, you're not walking out on us for good, are you?
I'm going to the bank.
Your heartless father asked me to deposit his paycheck so we could pay the bills.
oh, the nerve.
Where are you going?
I want to go with you.
Where are you going?
No, honey.
There's long lines at the bank and there's no place to sit.
It'd be a lot easier for me and more fun for you if you stayed here and played with your toys.
I'm going to the bank with Mommy.
OK, Eric.
You're older.
I'm counting on you to get us out of this.
- I can do it.
- I know you can.
- I've got it.
- I knew you could!
Look, it's the father/son game, right?
Not the father/sons game.
A loophole.
Only one of us has to go.
Ring, ring.
Hello?
It's the governor.
We're saved!
You're a genius!
Yes, I am.
Hey, good luck at the game.
Remember, when all Dad's friends go up and tousle your hair and call you "tiger" here's what a sincere smile looks like.
Time out, tooth boy.
Why do I have to go?
Look, Cory, I'd go but what if Dad and I started talking about golf talked about how someone broke his driver in the backyard hittin' rocks with it?
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
OK, fine.
I'm gonna go.
But wait.
What if Dad starts joking around about how nervous he is that you're getting your driver's license next year?
I'd have to calm him down by saying "Eric's driven your car around the block "a thousand times, and nothing's ever happened.
" - You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You wouldn't.
- I would.
- You wouldn't.
- What are you, new?
Look, I'm not going.
Well, I'm not, either.
I guess the only fair way is to let Dad decide.
- Fine.
- Fine.
May the best excuse win.
- Dad!
- Dad!
Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Start all over again this time in English.
Whoa, whoa.
No, try again.
One at a time.
You first.
Look, Dad, I can't play in the softball game tomorrow.
See, Vicki and I have this really important project due next week, and, well, we've had this study date planned since, like, 1942 - What subject?
- Science.
You're not in the same class.
We have identical projects due on the same day, oK?
Oh, amazing coincidence.
Isn't it?
Look, anyway I'm supposed to meet her at the library tomorrow Meet her on Sunday.
The library's closed sunday.
Not anymore.
They changed the hours.
Guys, I got to tell you something.
Dad, unbelievably, my left leg has to be tested for radon tomorrow.
I just got a phone call.
Yeah, it's probably nothing but I'm the last guy to endanger my family and the testing's free.
The game has been canceled.
And I told them, "Take the leg off "because, darn it, I got a softball game with my dad"!
They couldn't generate enough interest.
That stinks.
Yeah, I was psyched.
Ah, don't worry about it.
There'll be other games.
Hey, is the library really open on Sunday?
How do I know?
Not bad.
So, how was your weekend?
Ah, one of the all-time greats.
I slept in, I Watched TV I relaxed, I played video games.
And Sunday, I took it easy.
Hi, Cory.
Hey, look who just beamed down.
Hi, Topanga.
I missed you at the game Saturday.
What game?
Your father's grocery store against my father's bookstore.
Uh, Topanga, in this dimension, there was no game.
Yes, there was.
I played.
Topanga, that game was canceled.
You wish.
We were killing you until your father's assistant manager tried to throw the ball home from center field and sprained his elbow.
The ambulance had to come and take him away.
There's always an ambulance.
My father told me that game was called off.
Well, it wasn't.
What's the big deal?
Maybe your dad just didn't feel like playing.
Maybe he didn't feel like playing alone.
OK.
I'm here.
What?
Mom, this is bad.
Look, there was a father/son softball game on Saturday.
Oh, shocker.
You know?
She knows.
I don't get it.
Why'd Dad tell us the game was canceled?
Gee, guys, I'm not sure.
Did you give him any indication that you didn't want to play?
- No way.
- No way.
- We were completely cool.
- Completely cool.
- He knew immediately.
- He knows everything.
Obviously he picked up on the fact that you didn't want to play and he's the one who let you off the hook.
Worms.
We're worms.
We made our father feel bad.
Mom, can you get us out of this?
You know, for old times' sake?
Hmm.
Can't.
The fat lady has sung and gone home.
She's in her kitchen eating cheesecake.
Come on, Mom.
We made our father feel bad.
Well, he's a big boy.
He'll get over it But hopefully you guys learned something for the next time.
I have.
I really have.
Good.
Then you get over it, too.
I can't get over it.
I'll never get over it.
Dad really wanted to play, and he knew we didn't so he dumped the game for us.
It's like "The Gift of the Magi" except we didn't get him anything.
Are we bad sons, Eric?
Right now we are.
I don't feel so good.
I have appendicitis.
That's not your appendix, that's your heart.
I have ahearticitis.
Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Matthews.
Leonard Spinelli.
I work for your father down at the grocery store.
We know who you are, Lenny.
We're the ones that called you.
Yeah, I know.
And it was a rare treat but, since you never called me before I thought I'd give you one last chance to make sure you got the right guy.
Did you get the stuff we asked you for?
Yes, I did.
Then we got the right guy.
OK, let's see.
Ground chuck.
Hamburger buns.
You may be wondering how I sprained my elbow.
Lenny, we know you got hurt at the softball game.
What game?
You're not supposed to know about the game.
I hurt myself getting out of a turtleneck that shrunk.
We know about the game, Lenny.
Just don't let Dad know we know about the game.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
oK, let's recap.
Your father says there was no game but knows there was one.
You know there was a game but you don't want your father to know you know.
Well, let me ask you this don't you think he knows you know he knows you know you know he knows, you know?
You got to excuse me, I'm on painkillers.
Root beer.
Pickles and chips.
You know, this is the first occasion I've ever done myself physical damage that I can remember.
Ketchup.
Of course, I can remember many occasions when I've done myself vast emotional damage.
Pimento loaf?
Did We ask for this?
No, but I threw that in 'cause I really love it.
What?
Now we got everything we need for that all-guy party you described.
Lenny About that party, Lenny.
See Vast emotional damage.
We'd be delighted if you could attend.
Thank you.
Delighted to be here.
I'll go turn off my car.
Is this the best time you could ever have?
Just cooking burgers in the backyard Dad and his boys And his dad's assistant manager.
Time of my life.
I'd applaud, but I'd pass out.
Salad's done.
Good-looking salad.
Real men need a salad they can eat with their hands.
Yeah, you just pick it up and dunk it in the dressing.
Ah, no dirty dishes No napkins, no utensils When we're finished, we just hose down the porch.
Man meal.
End of story.
Boy, you guys know how to have a good time.
Someday, when I have a family I'm gonna have a good time.
Unless my wife divorces me and my kids hate me because she poisoned them against me and I have to send my entire weekly paycheck to support the blood-sucking leeches while I live in squalor and despair.
Did I mention I'm on painkillers?
Root beers all around?
Oh, right.
We're having fun now.
You having a good time, Dad?
Hey, great.
What could be better?
Yeah.
What could be better?
Yeah.
- Could I see you?
- Yeah.
He hates it.
He doesn't hate it.
He's having a nice time.
Nice isn't good enough, Eric.
Remember how psyched he was about the softball game?
That Was the time he Wanted.
He wanted one lousy softball game and we didn't give it to him.
We gave him dinner.
We gave him dinner which he's given us, what, only every night of our lives.
We thought it would be such a big deal.
I guess we should've just given him the game.
Yeah.
We should've just stepped up to the plate and said, "I pledge allegiance to my dad" and swung for that game-winning home run.
Think that would've been better than tonight?
Hey, you guys.
Come out and get some pimento loaf.
I just noticed the expiration date.
Oh, yeah.
Much better than tonight.
All right, class, when we were last in social studies We were addressing the issue of social dissent.
Miss Lawrence?
I've thought over my position, Mr. Feeny.
And not only do I not want to say the Pledge of Allegiance but I also do not want to wear shoes.
We who sit behind you object.
Mr. Matthews, you were a pro-pledger as I recall.
Yeah, I was, but I thought it over.
Oh?
You've changed your position?
No.
I haven't, but I can argue it better now.
Really?
Well, then, the floor is yours.
At first, I thought we should just say it because it was a tradition, and it's the flag but now I think it's dumb to do something and not know why you do it.
And what conclusion has that led you to?
That if there's something you care about like the country you live in or the father you have then allegiance, which means "Noun.
Loyalty or devotion to a government "or a group or a person.
" Allegiance is something you should show.
So, then you believe that you should respect the traditions of that government or group or person.
Yeah.
I should've.
Or teacher?
Or a teacher.
Why aren't you guys asleep?
We couldn't sleep, Dad.
We got something on our minds.
Yeah, and it's really dragging us down.
Oh, come on, guys.
Forget it.
You threw me a barbecue.
We're even.
No.
We're way past that guilt.
We never found out the score of the father/son softball game.
Oh, well, we got creamed.
You let those sandal-wearing, crystal-packing brown rice-eating veg heads walk all over you?
Hey, I wasn't even there.
Well, whose fault is that?
Yours.
- No, it isn't.
- oh, it isn't?
No.
Because traditionally it's the son's part of the game to not want to go.
And it's the father's part of the game to make us go.
You didn't make us go.
You didn't play the game.
You broke the tradition, Dad.
And I figure that's why we lost.
You do?
Yeah, but seeing as we're bucking tradition why do we have to wait a whole year to play another father/son game?
Yeah.
How about we challenge the Unicorn Rainbow Bookstore to another game right now?
Well, uh, I am free next weekend.
- So are we.
- No matter what we're doing.
All right.
We got a game.
We got a game.
We got a game.
- Oh, Dad - Hmm?
- On one condition.
- What?
- Lose the doll.
- Yeah.
Yes!
Victory!
Carnivores 36, Brussels Sprouts 9.
Hut hut!
And here's the game-winning father now.
Great slide into home, Dad.
Hey, high five.
All right.
Yeah, that was a great game.
I had a terrific time.
I can't wait till next year.
Ah, you don't have to.
That's the best part.
Yeah, the bookstore wants to go best two out of three.
We got a rematch next week.
Hey, that's nice.
Isn't that nice?
Yeah, that's nice.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Look, I'm sorry I didn't call you back, Kristen.
I forgot.
You forgive me?
Apparently not.
You know the big difference between guys and girls girls want commitment, guys want girls.
What's the matter with commitment?
You are so 11.
Hey, where's your mom?
She just blew through here a minute ago looking for contracts or something.
I don't know.
Hey, Dad, I'm pretty sure Mr. Feeny numbers those things.
Well, this was hanging on our side of the fence so its number is up.
I know I put those papers around here somewhere.
Now, you look very nice this morning.
Oh, there they are!
I need them for the closing on that brick split-level on oak Street.
I fact, you look downright huggable.
Hi, hon.
Morgan!
Your oatmeal's ready!
You know, you're gonna be leaving soon and that window of hugging opportunity will close.
Hey, Mom, I need a note for that field trip this Friday.
That should cover it.
Thanks, Mom.
Morgan!
It's getting cold!
Coffee?
Poured with love.
Cinnamon rolls.
I got it.
Hello.
Morgan!
This is the last time I'm calling you!
Oh, great.
It's Jimmy, and he's early.
I've got to get to this closing.
Mom, that was Judy, queen of zits.
She has a cold and she can't babysit.
Good.
Between her nose running and her zits popping, I don't want her in the house.
I'm done.
OK, well, I'll call a back-up sitter later on.
I don't want to punk out on my bowling league.
Hey, relax, you've got a responsible teenage son with no current social life.
I'll take the weasel.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, hey!
Some of that, some of that.
Got to go.
Morgan, if you don't get down here now I'm gonna give the oatmeal to the dog.
We don't have a dog.
Oh, excuse me for improvising.
Hey, Dad, can we order out for pizza tonight since Mom's got her bowling league and you've got your managers' meeting?
Sure.
Cool.
Now, the large with everything on it is gonna run us around 100 bucks.
Here's a 20.
I want change, massive amounts of change.
Hey, Dad, can I have this?
Sure.
Somebody ought to get some use out of it.
I know, you're going to use that rose to make up with Kristen.
Are you kidding?
She hung up on me.
I mean, that's what she wants for me to go back on my hands and knees and give her stuff.
So you're gonna give it to her?
Yes, I am.
You are so 15!
Al washes a car in 6 minutes.
Fred washes the same car in 8 minutes.
How long will it take Al and Fred to wash the car together?
Piece of cake.
Think about it, Mr. Matthews.
I don't have to think about it, Mr. Feeny.
It's simple.
It is anything but simple, Mr. Matthews.
But I've got the answer.
I'm not interested in the answer.
Why not?
Because I'm more interested in how you arrive at the answer.
And you couldn't possibly have arrived at the correct answer so rapidly.
But I did.
I've arrived.
I'm here.
I'm ahead of you.
Oh, well, then if you're ahead of me what is the answer?
- 7.
- 7.
That's not the correct answer.
But it has to be.
Al speeds Fred up.
Fred slows Al down.
So the answer is halfway between 6 and 8 7.
- That's not - That's not - the correct answer.
- the correct answer.
But it has to be.
- No, it doesn't.
- Why not?
Fred can't slow Al down.
Even if Al washes most of the car and Fred just washes a hubcap the total time still has to be faster than Al's time alone.
You with me?
So if Fred is 25% slower than Al then 25% of 6 minutes is Anybody?
It's a minute and a half which leaves us with the correct answer.
Hold your applause, please.
Mr. Minkus, you're wrong.
Wrong?
As in not right?
You know the law of averages better than I do.
It was bound to catch up with you.
Where are you going?
Nurse.
"Minkus, you're wrong.
" I've been waiting to hear those words since pre-school.
Does anyone else have any thoughts on this problem?
On this problem?
Om I'm channeling the ancient Egyptian mathematician who first solved this problem.
Check, please.
All right, Ms. Lawrence.
Let's see what you've come up with.
Well, oddly enough you and your metaphysical lab partner have arrived at the correct answer.
Let me see that.
Grraar!
Nice demon.
Interesting, isn't it, Mr. Matthews?
Mr. Minkus didn't get the correct answer but Ms. Lawrence did.
You would do well to consider that in your search for your answer.
She's cheating.
She copies off dead guys.
OK, we've got everything right in front of us.
We got a car, we got water, we got brushes.
We got Al and we got Malibu Fred.
Minkus got it wrong.
It's not like it's just an assignment anymore.
It's like a mystery.
And he could just not hack being wrong.
I mean, did you see him?
He went to the nurse and he never came back.
But Topanga got it right.
That is a clue.
OK, so what's the difference between Minkus and Topanga?
All right.
Minkus is really smart.
And really weird.
Now, Topanga on the other hand is really weird.
And really weird.
Minkus?
I Was.
I used to be.
Who's got the right answer?
Yes, Mr. Minkus.
That's right, Mr. Minkus.
Calm down, Minkus.
That's correct, Mr. Minkus.
Get a grip, Minky.
Another "A" for Mr. Minkus.
No.
Make that an A-plus for Mr. Minkus.
So what?
So you're not a genius anymore?
Right.
Now I'm just a brainless pathetic moron without a clue.
Trust me.
It's not so bad.
It's just a word problem.
Every problem has to have an answer.
There has to be an answer.
What's the answer, Matthews?
What's the answer?
In my opinion, 7.
Look at me.
What have I become?
A brainless pathetic moron.
We just went over this material.
They say the short term memory is the first thing to go.
Who says that?
I forgot!
The new Minkus.
I like him!
Hey, I see you guys got the car ready.
I'll order the pizza and you and your little friends can pick it up, oK?
Hey, thanks for inviting me, guys.
I saw my mom looking at her Let's Have Fun with Liver cookbook.
But she's got her bowling league tonight, Shawn.
No, that ended six weeks ago.
No, it didn't.
Yes, it did.
Shawn, my mom's in that league and she's been going every Wednesday night.
Well, I don't know where she's going but it ain't bowling.
You guys all set?
I'm about ready to leave.
For bowling, right?
Yeah.
Like every Wednesday night.
I'm going upstairs to say goodnight to Morgan.
See?
I'm telling you, the league ended 6 weeks ago.
Yeah?
If there's no bowling league why is my mom going out with this big, heavy Eric, something's wrong.
This doesn't weigh anything.
Maybe Mom forgot her ball.
And if those are bowling shoes there should be a number on the back just above the spike heel.
Eric, what does this mean?
It means Mom's going to be flashing some leg when she picks up that 7-10 split.
"La Buggy-a.
" La Bugia?
That's that fancy dinner place seniors always take their prom dates.
Why would Mom be going there?
Maybe Mom's dating a senior.
I mean, everybody else is.
I love you, too, pumpkin.
Morgan says she's getting hungry so you guys better order that pizza soon.
I'm on it.
Good.
Hey, keep your eye on your sister and I'll be home around 10:00.
From bowling, right?
Where else would I be going with my bowling bag?
Oh, this ball weighs a ton.
Ha ha ha!
OK, maybe it's not as bad as it looks.
I sure hope so because this looks pretty bad.
Does it look as bad as liver?
No.
Why is she going to La Bugia?
Why is she going to La Bugia with a bowling bag?
Is there trouble in paradise?
Between my mom and dad?
No way!
They're so happy, it's disgusting.
They're always kissing and being romantic.
Are they?
Or is Dad always kissing and being romantic?
What are you talking about?
Remember this morning he came in with a rose for her she didn't even care?
Yeah, and he poured coffee for her and she just walked away.
And that kiss she gave him this morning before she left was nothing more than a pity kiss.
Believe me.
I know what they look like.
The main thing is, she picked Wednesday nights.
The one night that Dad has his managers' meeting.
Yeah, and why was she in such a rush to leave this morning?
I mean, is she trying to get away from Dad?
You don't think she loves him anymore?
It could mean Worse.
I mean, no one goes to La Bugia alone.
You think she loves somebody else?
You guys better tell your dad.
Tell him what?
We don't have any proof.
- Get proof.
- How?
Don't you guys watch NYPD BLUE?
Tail her and talk dirty.
Tail her on our bikes?
Get on a bus.
You know where she's going.
Just get there, take a look around.
You know, he's right.
We should do this.
I mean, chances are we'll get there we'll find she's there alone in a cocktail dress bowling.
We're gonna have to go undercover.
- As what?
- Two kids.
By day, two ordinary kids.
By night, two ordinary kids on a bus.
Talking dirty.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
Here's the 20.
Order the pizza, watch my house and guard my sister.
And if I'm killed on this mission find out the answer to that car wash problem from Feeny and have Topanga channel it to me.
OK, what do you have?
A full house?
FuLL House?
I love those olsen twins.
Hi.
Daddy.
Well, hey, sweetie.
What are you doing up?
It's, uh, 10:15.
Shawn was teaching me how to play 5-card Go Fish.
Jacks or better to open.
Where's Cory and Eric?
They went to the library.
Would that be the public library the one that closes at 9:00?
No, no.
The other one.
I'm going to put Morgan to bed and then you and I are gonna talk a little more.
Kind of a relationship building thing?
No.
Great.
First time in my life I'm in trouble with someone else's dad.
Guys!
Your dad just got home.
Where is he?
Upstairs putting your sister to bed.
What did you find out?
Nothing good.
Mom Was at the club.
She was dancing with some guy.
In those red shoes.
Wow!
Yeah, she was snuggling up with him in a dark booth.
Who was it?
I don't know.
I couldn't tell.
Neither could I. There were lace curtains and plastic grapes hanging all over the place.
So what are you going to do?
I have no idea.
I can't keep this a secret, Eric.
You know me.
I'll crack.
Dad will say, "Good night, son.
" And I'll say, "Mom was with another guy"!
Shh!
Look, I mean, you're right.
We'll have to tell him.
Cory.
Eric.
You know I'm always here for you.
Just not right now.
Oh, by the way I told him you were at the library.
Great lie, Shawn.
The library closes at 9:00.
Yeah.
He knew that, too.
This is not gonna be easy to tell Dad.
Maybe we could just send him a letter.
"Dear sir, your wife was dancing with another guy.
Signed A concerned citizen.
" Good night.
Morgan.
Oh, no.
He's gonna say good night to me next.
I'm gonna blow!
You gotta handle this, Eric.
Look, you just stay quiet.
Let me do all the talking.
Why, hey, guys.
Hi, Dad.
Where's Shawn?
Oh, Shawn decided to walk home.
I'd have driven him.
Oh, relax, Dad.
He lives 2 blocks away.
Now why don't you sit down, relax and not think that anything terrible is going on in your life.
Would you like some pizza?
- Mmm.
- Hey, where's my change?
You know, speaking of change change can be a very positive thing in one's life especially unexpected change, which funnily enough we'll be talking about right now.
What's going on?
Where were you two?
Uh, well, for 21/2 hours we were on 4 different city buses going to and coming from this place.
This place?
Could you be a little more specific, please?
Uh, it was a rectangular place.
We, uh, we were at La Bugia, Dad.
Mmm!
La Bugia?
Mom was with another guy!
She was dancing.
With another guy!
Cory looked in the window and recognized Mom's shoes and the shoes of Do I have to draw you a picture?
It's all We could see.
It Was dark.
There's Mom's car.
Quick.
More pizza.
Well, I guess I'll have to have a little talk with your mother.
Hey, I'm here for you, Dad.
That's why I had you, son.
Hey, stranger.
Hi.
Well, I just had an interesting conversation with Cory and Eric.
Is anything wrong?
Yeah.
We're busted.
Oh, man, they found out?
Guess we just weren't sneaky enough.
Actually, I was sneaky enough.
What?
They only caught you, you, you brazen hussy.
They're still talking.
That's a good sign.
They're not yelling?
Not yet.
Oh, no.
Look, as long as they're not yelling we have a chance, but once they go quiet that's when we're in real trouble.
What's it mean when he's smiling?
- He's smiling?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, no.
He's lost it.
He's turned into Freddie Krueger.
I mean, you know how Freddie always smiles before Tch Aah!
- She's gone!
- What?
Mom's gone!
She left!
I don't see her!
We'll never see her again, Eric!
We don't have a mother anymore!
Hi, guys.
I overreacted.
Mom, are we still a family or have we become like an after-school special?
Everything is fine.
Are you sure?
Because Dad was smiling.
I understand you two did a little detective work tonight.
Sorry we ratted on you, Mom.
It Was me.
I folded under torture.
Yeah.
Dad said hello.
Look, I didn't go bowling tonight.
Aahh And I did stop at a gas station and change into that dress that you saw.
Aahh And I did go to La Bugia and danced the night away with the most exciting wonderful guy I know.
Mom, shouldn't this confession be a little harder for you?
I was dancing with your father.
- What?
- Dad's not our father?
It Was Dad!
How long have you guys known me?
Since we were born?
Before We Were born.
Right!
You know me inside and out.
You know my heart.
I was dancing with your father.
But I thought Dad had a managers' meeting.
Bogus.
- Like your bowling league.
- Yeah.
So you guys lied to us.
Look, Cor, I have a wonderful life and I love being a mother but that's just not all of who I am.
I mean, I also have a career and I happen to be madly in love with my husband.
- Cool.
- Yecch.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Cor because your father and I work very hard to keep our relationship fresh.
You know, keep the electricity going.
We want to stay hot for each other.
Aagh Cory.
You guys snuck off and lied to us.
Look, Cor, did you ever cut school?
Me?
No.
Uh-uh.
Off the record.
Once in fifth grade.
Did you have fun?
Yeah.
I went to the mall.
It was really cool.
Yeah, but you've been to the mall a hundred times.
Now, maybe it was fun because you weren't supposed to be there.
You know, like it was a bit dangerous?
Get it?
Yeah!
No.
Come on, Cory.
I mean, it's exciting.
It's adult.
Sneaking around's romantic.
Very cool, Mom.
I approve.
Thank you, Eric.
Well, I don't approve.
It sounds like you guys were just trying to get away from us.
And I think that's wrong.
See, that's the fine line between being an adult and being a kid.
When you're a kid, you see everything as right or wrong, black or white blonde or brunette.
But when you're an adult you realize that, that not everything is as simple as right or wrong.
I mean, sometimes there are gray areas.
Any of this make sense to you?
Of course.
I'm an adult.
You're very cool, Mom.
I'll take cool.
Now, if you guys will excuse me there's a guy in the back yard who owes me a goodnight kiss.
It's OK.
It's Dad.
Good morning.
Al washes a car in 6 minutes.
Fred washes the same car in 8 minutes.
How long will it take them to wash the car together?
And the answer is still not 7, Mr. Matthews.
I know that, sir.
What else do you know?
I know why you gave us this word problem.
To suck the fun out of our lives.
Yeah, that, but the main reason is to get us to stop thinking like kids and start thinking like adults.
I know that there's not always one right answer.
There may not even be an answer at all.
Startling.
And how did you arrive at that conclusion?
I found out that sometimes we need to learn to think differently.
That's how Topanga knew.
Because she thinks differently.
Really differently.
Well, Mr. Matthews in all the time We've known each other I don't think I've ever been so impressed.
Thanks, Mr. Feeny.
In the course of your education you have been taught to look for the right answer.
But you also must know that in life many times the right answer is that there isn't one.
This is an especially valuable lesson for you, Mr. Minkus.
So I'm afraid your calculations are all for naught.
Not necessarily.
I think I may have inadvertently discovered the secret of time travel.
Did your spirit guide talk to you and give you the answer?
Yeah.
My mom.
Wait a minute.
Maybe time isn't a continuum.
Maybe it's a random repetition of moments.
I think I've got it!
A continuum.
Maybe it's a random repetition of moments.
A continuum.
Maybe it's a random repetition of moments.
Nah.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Stuart?
Yes?
Did you leave this paper rose on my desk?
No.
Oh.
Actually it isn't a rose.
It's a camellia.
In the language of flowers a white camellia means perfect loveliness.
At least, that's what I've read.
Well, then The person who left this for me must be a sensitive and caring soul.
Is it just me or is love blooming among the nerd set?
I don't know.
The only time I've ever seen a look like that was just before Bambi's mother caught that bullet.
What a movie they'd make.
It's Minkus in Love.
Watch what happens when 48 pounds of near-sighted geek meets 10 pounds of hair from a parallel universe.
- Ha!
- Ha!
I think people who judge other people by their outward appearances are shallow and ignorant and will have much to answer for in their next life.
That may be the way it works on Remulak but here on Earth you're a nerd, you pay.
Good morning, class.
I trust you all had a good weekend.
I sure did.
My mom baked brownies and my dad rented two monster movie videos.
I sold blood.
This morning we have a guest lecturer.
The school board feels that since you're all starting the seventh grade next year it would behoove you to have an advanced taste of the experience.
Eric?
Cory!
Mr. Matthews?
Mr. Feeny?
Oh.
I thought the school said they were sending over good students.
Nice.
The problem with smart kids is they all have goals to pursue.
I'm just looking to get out of Algebra.
Lucky me.
Proceed.
Hi, kids, I'm Eric.
I'm in the 10th grade at Adams High the school you'll all be going to next year.
At least all of us who pass.
Hey, Minkus, pass this.
Please, class, give Mr. Matthews your attention.
Matthews?
Oh, yeah, I'm Cory's older brother.
I got the good hair.
Anyway, next year you guys will be seventh graders or, as we upper classmen will be calling you phlegmballs.
Now, there's gonna be a few things you're gonna need to know for survival on the mean streets of high school.
Will the exam process be more rigorous?
Yeah, uh Parties are gonna be a lot better, too because you can stay out later.
All right!
And, of course, cool clothes are a must.
For that young detention sitter on the go.
Yeah.
Uh, you're gonna want to know where the parking lot is, too because that's Where the most popular kids hang.
And you're gonna want to hang with them unless, of course you want to look like a complete nerd.
Ha ha ha!
No offense, Mink.
I have a question.
Who cares?
This isn't like home, Eric.
In here, when I raise my hand, you have to answer.
I do?
I do, too.
All right, now next year when you're 16 and driving to school would you be willing to give a ride to a certain few select phlegmballs?
Do I have to?
I Wouldn't.
Drop dead.
What do I owe you?
I have some freshly baked brownies here I thought you might enjoy.
Thanks for dropping them off.
I thought perhaps I could stay here and enjoy them with you.
Milk's in the fridge, babe.
Hey, not bad.
My sister Nebby made them.
Nebby?
Don't you mean Debbie?
No, Nebby.
It's short for Nebula Nebula Stopthewar Lawrence.
So your parents thought, like, what Linda was already taken?
Hey, cool braid.
You like it?
I can put one in your hair.
You can?
Sure.
Do you have some ribbons and a rubber band?
Upstairs in my room.
You know, I'd like to see more of her and less of him.
What?
Comes over with the brownies tries to get in good with your sister.
- So?
- So & Cory and Topanga & & Sitting in a tree & & K-i-s-s-i-n-g & No way.
Minkus wants her.
And yet she's not over at Minkus' house unloading brownies.
What are you saying, Shawn?
Cory, it all has to start somewhere.
See, Minkus gets squishy about Topanga.
Topanga gets squishy about you.
One day your solid as a rock the next day Squish.
Topanga does not have a squish on me.
She brought you brownies, dude.
Ipso facto, love-o you-o.
Hi, guys.
Ah, reinforcement snacks.
It doesn't look like you're starving to death.
Hey.
Eric, your can runneth over.
Garbage again?
I just took it out last week.
Mommy!
Mommy, look!
Topanga made my hair pretty.
She sure did.
Yep.
Brownies, braids she does it all but, uh, now she has to do it all at home.
But I was hoping I could stay.
You can't.
We're over the legal hair limit of this room.
Well, that wasn't very polite.
I can't afford to be polite, Mom.
I'm polite Squish.
I hear a lot of men treat the women they love like that.
I'll kill you, Shawn.
We got a little girlfriend action going on here?
- Yep.
- No.
& Cory and Topanga & & Sitting in a tree & & A-B-C-D-E-F-G & Mr. Matthews, we seem to be on similar missions.
Hey, Mr. Feeny how'd your class like my little pep talk today?
The class found you amusing and entertaining.
But you didn't.
On the contrary.
I found you both amusing and entertaining.
I didn't, however, find you very informative.
Everything I told them about the parties and clothes is true.
Well, that may be but you didn't tell them the whole truth.
Like What?
Well, like up until now they've lived in a small, protected environment.
Next year it'll be like moving out of a small town into a big city.
It's just a bigger school.
How easy is it to get drugs?
I don't do drugs.
But if you wanted to?
Pretty easy.
- Alcohol?
- Easier.
Cigarettes?
Oh, come on, Mr. Feeny.
I didn't want to bring them down with stuff like that.
I mean I wanted to give them something to look forward to.
Mr. Matthews, do you consider yourself popular an influential voice in high school?
Look, Mr. Feeny, I'm no role model.
Yes, but the moment you stepped into that classroom you became one.
That Was the Worst macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted.
You going to finish yours?
You're a pig, you know that?
Hey, I'm in a growth spurt.
I need fuel.
Yeah, well, those of us who sit near you don't like the exhaust fumes.
Oh, look.
Here comes the future Mrs. Cory Matthews.
Hello, Cory.
Cory's not here.
My sister rented a videotape I thought you might be interested in seeing.
He left.
You just missed him.
GodziLLa Goes to college.
Whoa.
That's the one where Godzilla scarfs down UCLA.
Yeah.
When can we borrow it?
You can't.
It's my sister's tape.
She said I can't let it out of my sight.
OK, what time should we be over at your house?
Our VCR is broken.
I'll have to bring it to your house.
All right, how about 4:00?
That will give me time to get home and get ready.
Get ready?
I mean get the tape.
That's all.
Bye.
Oh, man, she's got a thang for you.
What do I care?
All I want from her is brownies and videos.
You maggot.
Huh?
All these years pretending to be my close friend.
Close?
As in Philadelphia is close to Neptune?
All so you could get to her.
Her, Topanga?
I don't think so.
Oh, please.
The whole school's talking about you two.
What?
I ate a couple brownies.
I said I'd Watch a video.
Aren't you forgetting the trip to Acapulco?
What?
I embellished.
Do you really care about her or are you just doing this to humiliate me?
I give up.
Take it, Shawn.
Minkus Want to play walnut?
Your bodyguard can't be with you Be afraid Be very afraid.
I've got two words for you Antiperspirant.
That's 3 Words.
What's going on here?
I don't want girls to like me.
Why is everything changing?
Hey, Topanga forgot her notebook.
Want to trash it?
I got a little macaroni and cheese left.
Naw, she'll probably think it's some type of love code.
Oh, why do I have to be so attractive?
Oh, look.
It's a heart with a name doodled in swirly things.
"Mrs. Matthews.
" Give me a break.
"Mrs. Topanga Matthews.
" ooh "Mrs. Eric Matthews.
" Would you get off my What?
Eric, I'm glad I caught you.
We got to talk.
Not now.
I'm headed down to the video arcade.
Play games some other time.
This is important.
Hey, this is important, too.
Eric, somebody's in love with you.
Oh, yeah?
Who?
Topanga Lawrence.
You know, that hair in the front row with the girl attached?
We're talking about a sixth grader?
Later.
I'm telling you, Eric, she loves you.
Look, she's 11.
She's too young to have feelings like that.
Minkus is only 11, and he loves her.
Will you stop saying that word?
Nobody loves anybody.
I mean you're babies.
You're too young to understand the pain of love, the agony of love the seamy underbelly of love.
You're not going to fully understand it until you're 15.
Like you?
I understood it at 14, but, hey, I was a natural.
Look, Eric, you got to kiss her off.
Get her out of your life and mine.
She's not in mine.
Well, she's going to be.
You know, it sounds like you're jealous.
Oh, yeah.
I'm jealous.
That's just what I want, to be Topanga's boyfriend and then we can name our children Chewbacca and Plankton.
OK, I'll get rid of her.
What do you want me to say?
All right, she's coming over in a little while.
Tell her that We both think she's scum and that I'm politically incoherent.
- Incorrect.
- There you go.
All right.
I'll let her down easy but they're usually pretty crushed so when you hear the doorbell call someone to pick up the pieces, oK?
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your mom told me you're having a little confab about a girl.
Not any normal girl, a totally weird girl Topanga Lawrence.
Well, I bet most girls seem a little weird to you at this age.
Come on, Dad.
You don't understand.
I'm not talking "I'm a guy and I don't understand girls.
" I'm talking really, truly weird.
She eats sandwiches made out of brown rice and has a sister named Nebula.
Well, what seems to be the problem between you and this girl?
No problem.
See, I thought she had a crush on me.
She kept hanging around and doing things for me.
And you liked that.
No, I hated it but then I found out she really likes Eric.
And you were relieved.
No.
Disappointed?
No.
Confused.
See, Dad?
You always know.
Well, get used to being confused, pal because girls are going to be rattling your cage for the next 60 years.
Till I'm 71?
Yeah, but then you get a break.
You do?
Yeah.
You die.
Topanga, right?
Have a seat.
Uh, yeah, that's an interesting way to go but I was thinking couch.
Whatever you want.
So what's that?
Movie.
GodziLLa Goes to college!
Cory's gonna love this!
He loves monster flicks.
Oh, he really loved those brownies you brought over, too.
I mean, uh, you must really like him a lot to do all those nice things for him.
He's very nice in a young kind of way.
Um, see, that's why you two get along so well because you're young, too.
No.
I've done my chart.
I have a very old soul.
Uh, yeah, here's a tip for you, Topanga.
Not a lot of guys are going to be after your soul.
When you were talking to us in class you know what I noticed?
What?
Your aura was glowing.
Be that as it may my aura's too old for you to be looking at.
I don't understand.
It's because you're not ready to understand.
I am ready.
You're not.
OK, I was wrong.
Huh, maybe you are ready.
Look, Cory told me about you and he told me you're very smart.
I don't have to be smart.
No.
Look, you're going to have to be smart because there are a lot of guys out there that won't take aura for an answer.
What do you mean?
I mean, you've known me for, like, 5 minutes and you think you like me because you thought I was cute and who could blame you?
But a real relationship is based on so much more than looks.
And if you're old enough to have these feelings then you should know that.
You are so wise.
Yes, I am.
And that wisdom comes from knowing that if you have a relationship based on looks it's stupid and superfiicial.
Hi, I'm Topanga's sister.
Hi, I'm stupid and superficial.
Cory called and said Topanga wasn't feeling well and wanted to come home.
No, she's feeling fine.
Nobody has to go anywhere.
I mean, just look at her.
I think I'd like to go home.
Is she gone?
Oh, no.
More hair.
"There are strange things done in the midnight sun "By the men who moil for gold.
"The arctic trails have their secret tales "That would make your blood run cold.
"The northern lights have seen queer sights "But the queerest they ever did see "Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge I cremated Sam McGee.
" Cool!
"Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee "Where the cotton blooms and blows.
"Why he left his home in the South to roam around the Pole, God only knows.
" Burn him!
Mr. Feeny?
Um, may I come in?
Of course.
Uh, could I speak to your class?
Be my guest.
This better be good, Eric.
He was about to toast this guy.
So, uh, a couple of days ago I pretty much covered the big high school picture but, uh, I left out one little tiny detail.
You've all known each other since like, kindergarten.
But next year there's gonna be maybe 9 or 10 other sixth grade classes from different schools making up your seventh grade class and you're not gonna know all those kids.
A lot of them are gonna think differently than you.
What do you mean?
Well, do you smoke cigarettes?
No.
A lot of kids in your new school will.
A lot of them are gonna try to pressure you into it.
They're gonna tell how cool it is to smoke.
You want to be cool, don't you?
More than you could ever know.
Maybe you'll smoke.
I don't think so.
Why not?
Because according to New EngLand journal of Medicine smoking reduces lung capacity leads to emphysema and causes heart attack and lung cancer.
Well, what if she thought it was cool?
Then would you smoke?
In a heartbeat.
Welcome to the world of peer pressure.
So he smokes.
Do you think that's cool?
I think anyone who smokes is a disgusting pig.
I'm trying to quit.
WeLL.
it's not that easy.
Minkus.
There's all kinds of pressure.
I mean, what about alcohol?
Could you use somebody else as an example, please?
Sure.
What about alcohol?
What about it?
What about drugs?
Hey, calm down, Eric.
We're not into that stuff.
All we like is baseball and comic books.
Yeah, that's what you like now.
But that's going to change just like you're changing schools.
Just like you're going to start feeling a lot of new stuff inside you you're not really gonna understand.
How do you know?
Because you're growing up.
Some of you have already started.
She Loves me She Loves me not.
She loves me She loves me not.
This is absurd.
This isn't rational or logical at all.
She loves me She loves me not.
Look at him.
The love bomb has blown his head off.
This is big.
This love thing could kill us if we let it.
You and I have to make a deal right now.
Let everyone else go nuts.
We stay the same.
Forever.
Excuse me.
I'm new here.
How do I get to the principal's office?
We have a deal.
We have a deal.
The principal's office?
I've been there a million times.
I know exactly where it is.
I'll take you.
We have a deal!
We have a deal!
Monsieur Minkus if we could understand what you were saying we wouldn't need your help for the French test.
Pardonnez moi.
I will speak English.
You will please answer in French.
"The chicken.
" "Le pouLet.
" Le pouLet.
"The frog.
" La green oil.
La grenouiLLe.
Minkus, come on.
There's 10 letters here and you're only using Au contraire.
The final "E" is silent.
The double "L" Is like the Spanish "Ye".
And the diphthong creates a "W" sound.
It's very simple.
No, Minkus, you know what's simple?
Frog.
Yeah, the f-r-o is pronounced "Fra".
And the "G" Is like the English "Ga".
Why can't these French guys just speak English like normal people?
Who cares how the French talk?
I like how they kiss.
Wait a minute.
They kiss differently, too?
Let me put it this way, boys.
The tongue is not silent.
- Eeyeuw!
- Eeyeuw.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
There it is, the list who made first string, who made second string and who didn't even make the basketball team.
What do you think is worse second string or not making the team?
Second string.
What do you think is worse second string or falling out of an airplane and landing on the Empire State Building on your eye?
If you make second string, you still have to sit on the bench in front of everyone and your uniform's always clean and you always get a high number like 867.
Not something any of us have to worry about, however.
We're not second string, bench-warming, "B" team guys.
I made the "B" team!
I made the "B" team!
Can you believe it?
Wait till I tell my father!
Why don't we check the list?
Just to make sure coach spelled our names right.
"Hunter, Shawn, A-team.
" Surpriserama!
"Robertson, comma, Harris.
A-team.
" "Air" Harris.
I like it.
I'm going to have to shave this.
"Matthews, Cory, A-team.
" Wait a minute.
They spelled "A" with a "B"!
Duf, you're reading the wrong line.
"Matthews.
" B-team?
Come on, guys.
It's got to be a typo.
It's handwritten!
I'm on the B-team, second string.
Just drop me on the Empire State Building.
Aw, so what?
- Yeah, no big deal.
- It doesn't change anything.
I mean, it's not like you're going to lose your friends.
Right.
Homo sapiens.
Modern man.
As you can see, he walked fully upright had opposable thumbs, and was known for A mother who labels his underwear.
At least I have more than one pair.
Moving back through history we devolve to the Neanderthaloids who made and used tools.
Now, can anybody tell me what was going on before the Neanderthaloids?
Anybody?
Anybody but Mr. Minkus?
Take it away, Minkus.
A billion years ago, the world breathlessly anticipated the emergence of life from the prebiological organic compounds of the sea.
Ow.
You can take your seats.
Thank you.
What Mr. Minkus is saying is that we were waiting for the lowest form of life to crawl out of the slime.
I'm here.
What?
Mr. Feeny was just talking about you.
I Was in With the basketball coach.
I have a note.
Did I miss anything?
Two hundred million years of human evolution.
Cool.
So, what's the deal?
It wasn't a mistake.
I'm on second string.
Hey, you, too?
Congratulations!
Did you tell your dad?
No, I happen to like my dad.
Aren't you going to lunch, Mr. Matthews?
Why eat?
Eating would only keep me alive.
I don't understand your depression.
Mr. Minkus seemed rather enthused about his position on the second string.
Look, Mr. Feeny, I know you think Minkus is, like, the next Alvin Einstein but if he's so smart, why doesn't he know second string is for losers?
Alvin Einstein.
This is my life.
Maybe I should just quit basketball altogether.
- I agree.
- What?
Mr. Matthews, the lesson that you missed today was on natural selection.
Nature has already made a selection for you.
And as far as basketball is concerned you are the dodo bird.
Oh, yeah?
Well, no offense, Mr. Feeny but that Darwin didn't know diddly about sports.
Oh, I believe he did.
Survival of the fittest, Mr. Matthews.
In sports, the weak are weeded out.
Only the strong survive.
Hold it, hold it.
Are you saying I'm weak?
Did you make the first string?
No, but maybe that's just the coach's way of telling me to evolve.
Maybe I'm supposed to crawl my way out of the slime of second string and slither up to first string.
Look out, Mr. Feeny, I'm a species on the move.
It's so simple.
- Eric, you're here!
- Yeah, the old Eric's here.
The new Eric's going to be here in ninety days according to Make Me Big magazine.
I don't Want the new Eric.
I Want the Eric who's the best basketball player I know.
I'm not the best anything.
I'm scum!
You're scum!
You're scum!
You're scum!
Hey, hey, hey, I've got a problem here.
I need to get better in basketball.
You call that a problem?
I laugh at your problem!
Ha!
Could you take a flex break?
I need you to pay attention.
What?
I just started dating.
Now it's gone.
Dating's over.
They ripped it away from me.
- Heather dumped you?
- Yeah.
They all dumped me.
Every tenth grade girl in America dumped me.
What'd you do to upset them?
I'm not a senior.
That's What I did.
I'm a sophomore!
You know what that makes me?
- Scum!
Scum!
Scum!
- Scum!
Scum!
Scum!
Seniors with their cars and their muscles and their Burger King trainee hats!
Eric, you're ignoring me.
Yeah, well, the whole world doesn't revolve around you, Cor.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Ohh!
I'm starting to get that feeling.
Eehh!
I'm going to be the best princess in the play.
Morgan, if you don't hold still you're going to be the best princess with tetanus.
I'm home.
No interviews, please.
I'm a princess.
Yeah, and I had lunch with Elvis.
Somebody's in a snicky mood.
What's the matter, Cor?
Your first game didn't go well?
Yeah, didn't go well is a thing you could say.
- Want to hear about it?
- Cookies!
I got to get that and slide in another dozen.
- I'll be back in two seconds.
- I'll take the cookies out!
No, Morgan, they're hot!
Your costume Hey, Cory.
You just kill and eat a Vegas showgirl?
Hi, dad.
Morgan's a princess today.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't see your basketball game.
Mom told you why, didn't she?
Mom and I didn't really get a chance to talk.
Ah, well, you see, the district manager showed up, and - It's oK, dad.
- No, it's not oK.
Give me the play-by-play.
Don't leave anything out.
Make it come alive for me.
- Well, we won.
- All right!
But, dad, I think you should know I didn't actually get Dad!
Look, this is serious.
I need $36,000 right now.
Sure, can you break a fifty thousand?
Come on, dad.
Heather used the words "other people.
" You know what that means?
"other people" with cars.
Now, look, you give me $36,000 for a 'Vette and I'll never ask you for anything again.
No.
I had a feeling you might say that but I came up with a plan on how to save you $26,000.
Say it with me, dad Harley.
Say it with me, Eric Schwinn.
Excuse me, dad, but I'm still alive for free, and You're not even old enough to drive.
Oh, so now you're on me for not being a senior.
Eric, sit down, will you?
Cory, come on, tell us all about your big game.
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a big game and I wouldn't call it mine.
Hi, guys.
I didn't know you were home.
Mom, you do not want to see me on a motorcycle - do you?
- No.
See, dad?
Mom wants you to buy me the car.
But if you really want to hear about it - I made cookies.
- You did?
Because if you really want to hear about it I'm the guy to tell you.
Yep, and mommy helped.
Wild Cats are down two points with only a minute left in the game.
The ball in bounds he flies down the court to take the pass!
He shoots!
He scores!
It's a tie game!
Mustangs try to toss to midcourt!
I dart between two humungoids and snatch the ball!
Their only hope is to foul me on purpose.
They do!
I'm at the line.
There's no time left on the clock.
The crowd goes nuts!
Cory!
Cory!
Cory!
The ball leaves my hands and arcs in superslow motion as the crowd goes deathly silent.
And then swish!
Nothing but net!
The crowd goes, "Aah"!
I win the game!
- That's incredible.
- I can't believe I missed it.
You're such a hero, Cor.
No, I'm not.
You know why?
I didn't even get to play.
I just made all that stuff up.
He has an active imagination.
You know why I don't get to play?
Because I'm just a second string, bench-warming nobody.
- Cory - First of all there's nothing wrong with being second string.
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with being second string.
Now, why didn't you tell us this before, Cor?
He told me.
It's going to cost me the car, isn't it?
Why didn't you tell us?
You're supposed to tell us what he says.
That's why you sleep in the same room with him.
You see?
I'm trying to spill my guts out and you guys are having a family meeting.
This is why I have to make up a whole exciting life to get any attention.
- Oh, Cory, that isn't true.
- Yes, it is.
You spend half your day with Eric at the store and the rest of the time you're talking about his pathetic love life.
Hey.
And you're always braiding Morgan's hair or making a costume for her.
And, I mean, I get it that she's the baby of the family and all, but You know, being second string in basketball is hard enough but I'm only on the second string in my own family.
Why don't you want me to go up and talk to him?
Because I think you and I should talk first.
What about?
Cory's had a basketball disappointment.
He's overreacting.
I'm going to go tell him that.
Is he overreacting?
What does that mean, that he's right?
That I spend more time with Eric I don't care as much about him?
No.
I just think that Cory is going through middle-pause.
Is that a scientific term?
Yeah.
I mean, this week, Eric has girl problems Morgan needs to be a princess and there's a kid in the middle that didn't get heard.
Because there's three of them now.
We let ourselves get outnumbered.
Yep.
When there were two of them we had them covered man-to-man.
Now we're in a zone defense, and Cory's problem got by us.
What's the game plan, coach?
Full court press, double-team Cory.
- Go, team, go.
- Hey.
Just a little sport thing.
Wasn't that a great game yesterday sitting on the bench, cheering on the team?
I'm still pumped!
Minkus-Abdul Jabbar!
We couldn't have been any closer to the action unless we actually played.
Check it out.
I dug out this old edition of Sports illustrated for you.
I already know I'm not on the cover.
Lighten up.
There's an article in here on great sports figures who sat on the bench before they got their big break.
Really?
Yeah.
It says that Steve Young sat on the 49ers' bench for five years before he became the starting quarterback.
And then he won MVP.
- Man, this is good news.
- I knew you'd like it.
Wow.
These are, like, major guys.
And they all came back from the brink.
If they can do it, you can do it.
Yeah!
That'll prove I'm worth something.
Maybe coach'll put you in the game today.
Maybe you'll score twenty points.
Yeah, maybe then I'll be on the A-team permanently.
I'm going to be season MVP.
I'm going to be unstoppable!
Matthews, why are you suited up?
Second-string doesn't go to the away games.
Anybody home?
Mom?
Probably baking cookies with Morgan.
You know, there was a time when you used to bake cookies with And I'm talking to nobody.
Anybody home?
Well, the furniture's still here so you didn't move without me.
Tonight on Hard Edition when her daughter didn't seLL enough cookies to win the grand prize Mom killed the whoLe troop.
Now there's a mom Who cares.

When you've got family a house fuLL of Love and a puppy .

.
By carefully inserting the tip of the probe into the throbbing heart muscle Dinnertime, and nobody's home.
I'm eleven years old!
Come on!
I'm on a schedule here.
What am I supposed to do for food?
Mr. Matthews, what are you doing?
Uh, I'm burying a hamster.
I see you basted the little cadaver with barbecue sauce.
Mr. Feeny, nobody's in my house.
My family's abandoned me.
Is that so?
Why would they do something like that?
Maybe because I only made second-string and they were ashamed of me.
You think that's what happened, huh?
That's why I'm trying to survive on my own.
I mean, I saw your chicken cooking and the voice of Chuck Darwin whispered in my ear "Just do it.
" Survival of the fittest, Mr. Feeny.
You taught me that.
In the first place, Mr. Matthews snatching a chicken from a grill is hardly chasing down and spearing a mastodon.
And in the second place, your family didn't abandon you.
They went to your basketball game.
My family went to my game?
Why?
One would assume that they wanted to watch you play.
But, I mean, I told them second-string doesn't get to play.
We just sit on the bench and rot.
Well, then, one would assume that they went to watch you rot.
My family drove all the way to Cheltenham to watch me sit on the bench?
- Yes, Mr. Matthews, they did.
- Why would they do that?
Well, perhaps if you kept listening to the voice of Chuck Darwin he might've told you that the highest form of evolution is a family of human beings who genuinely care for each other.
What if it seems like sometimes they don't care?
Sometimes you have to give your family the benefit of the doubt.
That's part of your personal evolution.
Do you know what happens to you if you stop evolving?
I end up like this guy?
More or less.
Mr. Feeny, we got a situation here.
I need you to drive me to the game.
I need to drive me to a restaurant.
You buried my dinner, remember?
I'm sorry about your chicken.
Drive me to the game, and I'll buy you a couple corn dogs.
Tempting, but no.
Please, Mr. Feeny.
My family's finally there for me.
I need to be there for me for them.
Oh, have some dignity, man.
My car's out front.
Cool.
You know, if we dust this off we can eat it on the way.
Ah, what a night.
Those sixth grade girls thought I was so cool.
I'm going to tuck Morgan in.
I'll be right back down.
I want to say good night to Cory first.
Well, hero, say good night to your sister.
Good night, Morgan.
You were awesome.
Must you kiss me?
Well, you had yourself a big night tonight.
Six points.
Who would've thought three first-stringers would foul out and they'd need me to jump in?
Yeah, maybe your coach learned to bring a couple second-stringers along with him on the road games to cover his butt, huh?
I'm really proud of the way you handled yourself.
Three baskets in the last minute.
Mr. Clutch.
Sure, we were up by thirty-one, but still.
Well, I'm not talking about basketball.
I'm talking about the way you handled things today.
You come home to an empty house there's nobody here, but you don't panic.
You commandeer the neighbor's car And the neighbor.
And you get yourself to the game.
It's called survival of the fittest.
I was explaining it to Mr. Feeny earlier.
Well, Morgan doesn't want to hear a story from me tonight.
She wants to hear a story from the basketball star.
I think I can squeeze in a little Green Eggs and Ham before I hit the showers.
- Hey, guys?
- Hey, Cor.
How come you drove all the way out to my game?
I mean, you knew I was just going to sit on the bench.
You must've had something better to do.
Me?
No.
Well, Cory, it really doesn't matter to us if you sit on the bench or if you score a hundred points.
Come on, it does so.
No, it really doesn't.
I mean, there are times when I catch your father just watching you sleep.
Only if there's nothing good on TV.
You still watch me sleep?
Do you watch Eric?
Yeah, but I'll probably stop when he's a senior and he gets a life.
Hey, thank you for your support.
I think I'm going to go into the kitchen and eat something that causes a lot of zits because it really doesn't make any difference.
Look, Cor, there's nobody in this family that's going to be disappointed by you being second-string, third-string, or no-string as long as you try the best you can.
We're only disappointed when you don't tell us if something's bothering you.
Well, I tried, but nobody was listening.
You want to know who's in my room telling me a story?
Nobody.
Come on, honey, you have to wait a minute.
We're talking with Cory.
Well, look, Cory, you're going to have to make me listen.
How?
Just grab my face and say, "Hey, dad!
Listen to me"!
As long as you got my face, you got my attention.
- Dad?
- Yeah?
Let go of my face.
I feel kind of bad about the things I said.
Uh-huh.
And, well Don't you hate it when you have to apologize?
Yeah, but we don't mind hearing them.
You know, when you're eleven, and you start hanging out at a lot of other sixth graders' houses you get to know a lot of other parents.
Believe me, I know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones.
And?
And, well What do you want from me, blood?
Hey!
Where's my story?
Good night.
Good night.
I'm telling you, Feeny's a maniac behind the wheel.
I didn't know a Gremlin could go that fast.
No way.
Feeny?
The guy takes twenty minutes to peel an orange.
Hey, I was in the car.
He was clipping corners, driving on the sidewalk catching air off speed bumps.
Our Mr. Feeny burning rubber?
I think not.
I thinkWhat We see in the classroom just may be the Clark Kent side of Mr. Feeny.
I would've had you if that light hadn't turned yellow.
Hey, you snooze, you lose.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
"Once I wished I was a duck "as mostly ducks have lots of luck.
"They swim around all day in a pool and mostly never have to go to school.
" Beaver, I think that's very, very cute.
Hey, Beav, you still think you'll get a prize for that?
Sure, Wally.
I'm the only kid in the third grade who wrote a poem.
So, how do you feel Ward and June handled their family problem?
- They were too perfect.
- Too TV.
I agree with you, Mr. Matthews.
That's not like you.
In fact, you brought me to today's assignment.
That's like you.
Back in the prehistoric 1950s when Cleavers strode the earth The U.S. Census indicated that a model American family had a mother, a father, and two children.
Leftovers.
What are you talking about, Mr. Matthews?
Well, last year in fifth grade we divided up into families and solved problems.
It's sixth grade now, Mr. Feeny.
Families are yesterday's news.
Very well.
This year, I shall let you form into urban gangs.
Cool.
Each gang will have a mother, a father, and two children.
You just love dangling that little string of hope in front of us and yanking it away, don't you?
I had a cat.
I bet it hung itself.
In this assignment each participant will help the other to become an ideal family member.
For instance Mr. Hunter and Mr. Minkus will be paired as brothers.
- Oh, no.
- oh, no.
Trust me.
You are going to enjoy this.
I know I shall.
Now, each of you will write a profile of a model brother.
Then each of you must become that brother.
You mean Shawn has to act exactly like I want him to?
That's correct, Mr. Minkus.
You're gonna be Minkus' brother.
Nerd-o-rama.
I'd hate to be the guy who had them for sons.
Funny you should say that, Mr. Matthews or, as I like to call you Dad.
He's gonna be my father?
Yes!
And Miss Lawrence your mother.
No!
Uh-oh.
Don't look at them.
OK.
It's a game.
They pretend not to notice.
They're very good at this game.
But then I pretend to not notice them not noticing.
Bottom line is, nobody walks away from this.
You have a rich inner life.
One time, wouldn't it be incredible I mean, truly incredible if a beautiful girl came right up to me tapped me on the shoulder and said "I've had my eye on you.
"You are unbelievably handsome.
"You wanna talk for a few minutes"?
Is that too much of a thing to ask?
Excuse me.
I've had my eye on you.
Are you aware that you're unbelievably handsome?
You missed.
I'm Alexis.
What's your name?
I used to know this.
Eric.
What?
Eric.
Eric.
Eric, Eric Matthews.
And I'm Jason.
I'm the guy you want to talk to.
He was just standing in my spot when the miracle occurred.
You stand right here.
Eric, have you ever considered a career as a professional model?
Would your hand always be there?
I'll guide you the entire way.
I'm in.
I'll be at my booth.
Don't keep me Waiting.
Eric, take me with you.
Why would I do that?
Because I am your friend.
We have been friends since we were, like, what, three years old.
You're gonna dump me for her?
You make a decision, buddy, right now.
Choose me or her.
See ya.
"I am Topanga's model husband.
" I'm sorry.
I'm just flat-out looking forward to this.
"I live my life in harmony "with the physical and metaphysical world "aligned with the Navajo spiritual path.
" Uh-huh.
oK.
Um, I could do that.
I'd love to do that.
There's just one little thing that might throw this off just a smidge.
- What?
- I'm not a Navajo!
You don't have to be a Native American to be in tune with nature.
Don't you hate it when Mom and Dad fight?
No.
Into it.
Well, we're not fighting long.
'Cause I got something here that'll take the fight right out of Mom.
Read it and weep, little big hair.
"My model wife won't care how dirty my room gets.
" Ha ha!
"She will always let me win at video games.
"She will play street hockey at any time, day or night.
" Why don't you just marry Shawn?
'Cause our kids would look like horses.
My turn.
Here you go, bro.
Minkus, this is, like, forty pages.
Since I have no siblings, I spend many hours imagining what a younger brother Minkus would act like.
Maybe something like this.
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.
He thought he felt her hot, mossy breath on his eye.
He blinked.
She was gone.
The beating of wings Obsession.
Get help.
Ahem.
I was discovered today.
- You get discovered at the mall?
- How'd you know?
Did you pay $90 to get photos taken?
Yeah, you can't model without a portfolio.
You were scammed.
They get you to pay all this money And then you never hear from them.
Completely untrue.
It's not a scam.
Yeah, listen to Minkus, boys.
He's the smart one.
I, too, was discovered at the mall.
Doh!
Eric, girls are gonna dump you all your life so get over it.
He got scammed at the mall.
Scammed?
How?
Well, some girl told him he was cute and he forked over $90 for modeling photos.
$90?
$90?
Can I speak with you alone for a second?
No.
I would like to speak with you outside.
I know you would, but my anger would still be here in the kitchen.
Alan I'll be back.
I know exactly what you were gonna say to him.
No, you don't what I was about to say to him.
Yes, you were gonna say "Eric, get your butt down to that mall "and I don't want to see you again "until you get your money back!
" oK, what was he going to say?
I don't know.
He's more complex than you.
Anyway, the point is that we've made mistakes with money.
Let him make his.
Honey, what are we supposed to do just hang back, do nothing?
We are doing something.
We're trusting our child, and if he makes a mistake he'll learn from it.
I have been a parent for fifteen years and I think I know a little better than to trust my own kids.
Look, guys, I feel like a total jerk.
You shouldn't let me manage my own money.
I'm going to the mall, see if I can get it back.
Thanks for not jumping on my case.
That's oK, honey.
I married you for your body.
Look at her, that black widow spider.
I mean, she spun me into a web of deceit and hung me there like a dead fly.
She thinks she can Lure me in with her angelic eyes and swimsuit issue body.
Yeah, well, she can't.
I'm a rock on this.
Eric!
Please don't let me give her any more of my money.
I'm glad you're back.
I bet you are.
Now, look.
I want - A job?
- What?
I got a modeling job for you here at the mall.
Oh, sure.
What else do I have to buy, huh?
More modeling classes?
How about a billboard a big billboard with "Eric Matthews is an idiot" plastered all over Philadelphia?
The job pays $50.
If they like you I can get you more the next time.
You're serious?
This is a real modeling job?
Hey, either you want it or your don't.
You're not the only gorgeous guy with big hazel eyes here at the mall.
Heh heh.
Actually, they're brown but kind of a hazely brown.
You know what the tough thing is about being married?
Actually being married?
Yeah, that.
And learning to be the type of husband your wife wants you to be.
Were you going to say something, sweetheart?
Heh.
Not for the last eighteen years, darling.
Hey, you get your money back?
Better than that.
I got a career.
Excuse me?
Look, Dad, we've spent a lot of great times together and I'll never forget how well you treated me.
Son, are we breaking up?
Well, actually, I'm leaving my job at the store.
I got my first job as a model.
It's just the beginning for me.
I'm, uh, giving you your apron back.
Thanks for taking it so well, Dad.
"Don't do anything.
"Let him work it out for himself.
" Fabulous.
He Was supposed to realize his own mistake.
No, no, don't even think about it, sweetheart.
Sit back.
Do nothing.
We've raised the perfect teenage boy.
He's quite capable of running his own life.
Alan I'm letting you out of your cage.
Thank you!
Eric.
you are not going to quit a steady job for one modeling assignment.
I'm sure if you really think this through you will realize that this is not something you really want.
I've thought.
I want.
When?
When did you think in the ten seconds since you got home?
That is not the way you make an important decision that will change your life.
You want to make an important decision?
You consider every aspect of it.
And after you have thoroughly thought this through then, and only then, because I am confident in the way you were brought up I will support you in what you want to do.
I Want to be a supermodel.
Doh!
OK.
Really?
Really?
Yes, really.
I am not the type of father who dismisses his son's well-considered aspirations with some quickly tossed-off parental negativity.
That's it?
Shut up!
You are the greatest parents in the world!
Dad, you're gonna let him just walk away like that?
I just did, didn't I?
Yes, he did, and you know why?
Because your father has decided to trust his children.
Look, Dad, I know something about being a father.
And I know that this plan of yours cannot possibly work.
If I ran my school family like that, I'd get an "F '".
Don't you see Eric's making a huge mistake?
Corey, let me tell you something about being a father.
Um, it doesn't matter if you see it or I see it.
It only matters that he doesn't see it.
Well, in that case, can I spend the night at Shawn's?
It's a school night.
Yeah, but I don't see that, Dad.
Only you see that.
Well, do you see this?
You know, Dad, those aren't very clear-cut rules.
Kind of a double standard going on.
If you keep changing the rules how am I gonna learn how to be a model father?
Ask your wife.
So, this family's crisis the older, cooler brother wants to get a tattoo.
Conflicts abound.
Take it away, younger, uncool brother.
I can't fathom why any human being in full possession of his faculties would want to render himself permanently disfigured with so-called "body art.
" Whoa.
What?
I'm such a good geek I scared myself.
Listen, pinhead, it's my body.
And I'll do whatever I want with it unless maybe you'd like to try and stop me you woodchuck faced, nearsighted underweight, future I.R.S. auditor.
Mr. Minkus, I might remind you that eventually the bell will ring and he will be he, and you will be you and natural selection will once again rule the blackboard jungle.
Will five cover it?
Hey, talk some more.
OK, you live under our roof.
We make the decisions.
No tattoo.
Tattoo, you, no.
A person's body is his temple.
If our son Wants to ornament his temple With a tattoo let him worship in his own way.
Nam myo ho renge kyo.
You are so bizarre!
I've decided, without benefit of discussion with my spouse because that's the kind of husband I know you'll be the tattoo will have to wait.
Whoa.
Cool.
Stuart, a tattoo.
It speaks to me.
Minkus, what's the deal?
We agreed on no tattoo.
Mr. Feeny's assignment was to solve a family problem and I decided to solve it my way.
Well, actually, his way.
Minkus you've got a dark side.
It speaks to me.
Let's not go overboard.
It's just a press-on.
Great.
Thanks for screwing up the assignment.
On the contrary, Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Minkus didn't screw up the assignment at all.
Yeah, but we had our family discussion all planned out, and he messed it up.
He broke the rules.
Which is exactly what happens in real families.
There is no model household.
There are no model parents.
I think the only way you can judge a family is by how much love there is in the home.
Excellent point, Miss Lawrence.
A family is a living, breathing thing that requires constant adjustment and change.
But Beaver's dad never changed.
You always knew what he was gonna say.
Beaver's dad Wasn't real.
Real fathers have to adapt.
Real fathers don't have a script like Beaver's father did.
I guess it's easy to sound smart when you've got the best writers in Hollywood writing everything you say.
I Wouldn't know.
Hi.
I'm Eric Matthews.
I believe you'll be taking pictures of me.
Because he's a model.
And we're the babes who hang out with him.
Because he's a model.
And who are you?
I'm the happy sidekick.
Come on, Matthews.
They're waiting for you in wardrobe.
Wardrobe industry term for clothes.
Excuse me.
Look, my shoot starts at 4:00.
Make sure these girls are here.
I want them to see me in all my glory.
I quit!
You can't quit.
You signed a contract.
Do you have any idea what it's like to dress up in a humiliating outfit and have people gawk at you like you're less than human?
Been there.
Done that.
Welcome to the world of big-time modeling.
What are you looking at?
Oh!
Cory!
Cory, that lobster over there seems to know you.
Boy, what kind of idiot would wear one of these getups at the mall?
Come here!
Apparently Eric.
Eric, this may come as somewhat of a shock but you're a lobster, dude.
Look, Jason and I invited Well, I hope they bring a side of slaw.
You have to get rid of them!
Jason!
Hey, come to see your brother up in lights, too, huh?
Yeah, but he had to leave.
Why?
What happened?
Uh, he's not feeling well.
Yeah, he's a little under the water.
- Weather.
- Yeah.
Wow, how weird.
He was fine a few hours ago.
So, I guess you want to just take the girls and get out of here immediately, right?
Is anyone hungry?
Shoppers.
now's your chance to win a free Lobster dinner from Larry's Lobster Locker!
Oh oh, lobster.
Win us a lobster.
ALL you have to do to win a free meaL is knock Larry the Lobster into the giant tub of butter.
Eric!
My brother Eric!
That's my brother Eric!
Oh, check it out.
Oh, he's a lobster.
How embarrassing for him.
Maybe we should be sensitive and understanding.
Then We Wouldn't be us.
- Dunk him.
- Dunk him.
Hey, come on.
Don't throw that, Jason.
We've been best friends since we were three years old.
Who are you gonna listen to some girls you don't even know or me?
See ya.
Ahem.
Welcome to Market Giant, sir.
Here on aisle one you'll find our sugar, flour, and iodized salt.
Over here on aisle two, you'll find our cereals rice, and freeze-dried coffees.
Do your items need bagging, sir?
Here, let me help you quickly and efficiently.
I know that cans go on the bottom durable boxes on top of that oK, oK, oK.
I get it.
You're the best former box boy that ever lived.
Well, thanks, Dad.
You know it takes talent to notice talent.
Are you asking for your job back?
Uh, yes, but asking is just my opening offer.
I'm prepared for begging and authorized to go as high as groveling.
Eric, that position is filled.
You hired someone else?
Dad hired someone else.
Did you grovel?
How could you do that, Dad?
I'm the store manager.
It's kind of my job.
You got to give me my job back, Dad.
Eric, I can't fire somebody just because you suddenly want to come back.
Dad, do you remember when I was little and we used to play Monopoly and I'd roll the dice and land on Boardwalk - while you had a hotel on it?
- Yeah.
Well, you called a misroll and you let me roll again.
Yeah.
Well, Dad, this modeling thing I I misrolled.
Yeah, but you're not little anymore.
You wanted to make your own decisions live your own life.
I let you.
I know, but come on, Dad.
Just for old time's sake?
Can't I be little again?
Eric, I'm not always gonna be there to give you another roll.
I know, but you're here now.
I mean, you're my father.
You're supposed to help me.
Can I have my job back, please?
No.
But we could use some help on the weekend night shift.
My old job?
Goodbye, Friday and Saturday nights.
What's the difference?
After those two girls tell all the other girls about your secret life as a lobster do you think you'll ever date again?
I'll take the job.
Ooh, you're good.
Oh, you think so, huh?
Yeah, because when you're a good father like you and me you realize that once in a while kids do stupid things like become a lobster or get a tattoo.
But a family's a living, breathing thing.
And you didn't let that throw you.
Did you get a tattoo?
- Hmm?
- What?
Did you get a tattoo?
Because if you got a tattoo You are not gonna be a living, breathing thing.
Where is it?
- You're missing the point, Dad!
- Where's the tattoo?
So you teach modeling, huh?
Mm-hmm.
And you probably sell the pictures a guy would need for his portfolio, too?
Mm-hmm.
And that would run in the range of what, ninety bucks?
Are you lost?
No.
See, I saw your modeling pictures up here and I was wondering If I'm the type of guy you're looking for.
Not interested.
How come you're not interested?
Do you have $90?
See ya.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Topanga and I invested our imaginary $1,000 in the stock market.
- And how did you do?
- We kicked Wall Street butt.
Yet, none of the companies we invested in discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or bad karma.
You got to love her.
You got to lock her up.
Well thought out, Mr. Minkus.
Very politically correct, Miss Lawrence.
Which company's next?
Mr. Feeny, this project wasn't due for another week.
This is just a progress report, Mr. Matthews.
Those companies Who've made progress should have no problem.
Ahem.
We have a problem.
Our investment plan is proceeding.
We are pleased to report we have absolutely no losses.
And we haven't fired anybody, and nobody quit.
They haven't even started yet.
No?
Come here.
In the week that you have left with this assignment I Want to see some real effort.
Mr. Feeny, "effort" is my middle name.
'Cause it starts with "F '".
I'm glad our company is making money because as the future mother of my children you are going to live in the lap of luxury because I am a provider, babe.
Minkus, anyone can draw lines on a chart and say they're making money.
You know, you guys are big talk because you're bigger than me but when it comes to using your brains how confident are you?
More confidenter than you.
Let me handle the negotiations, Mongo.
What have you got in mind?
I say we forget Feeny's imaginary money and we invest real money and see who comes out on top.
I don't have a real $1,000.
You get an allowance, don't you?
That five bucks is sacred.
That's my snack money.
- Afraid?
- No.
- Yes.
- Make it ten.
- Are you nuts?
- Fifteen.
Apparently, I'm invisible.
- Twenty.
- Twenty-five.
Topanga, make them stop talking.
As an equal partner in our corporation I'd like to have a voice in this.
Fine.
Let me set it up for you.
It's me against them in a battle of wits.
$300,000.
Ten bucks it is.
There's a sucker born every minute.
TWo that minute.
I'm just going to give this to Minkus now so I don't get attached to it.
It's been real, Abe.
OK, I've got an idea.
Let's call my Uncle Frank.
He knows horses.
You want to bet our allowances on a horse?
Come on.
Uncle Frank puts our 10 bucks on a 5-to-1 shot.
Bingo, bango fifty bucks.
We win the bet, we sell our story, we're movie stars.
Shawn, I just have one question.
If your uncle knows how to make money this easy how come he lives in a trailer?
We bet our whole week's allowance on a horse.
I can't breathe.
My lungs can't take it.
I got gastritis.
Hey, who sent you a valentine?
"Dear Boom-Boom " That's what my dad calls my mom when he thinks no one's listening.
Boom-Boom?
Yeah, it makes me sick, too.
"Roses are red, violets are blue "Valentine's Monday, let's rendezvous.
" They're always leaving goofy notes for each other secret meetings, romantic weekends.
When you're a parent, that's all you have left.
Yeah, my folks are romantic like that.
Last year for Valentine's Day, my dad rotated my mom's tires.
And now the results of the ninth race from Aqueduct.
It's posttime.
The winner is Tuna MeLt by a neck followed by Hot Wax and Jacob's Ladder.
Tuna MeLt paid 19.
80 to win and 5.
40 to show.
- Aah!
- What?
What?
- We won!
- How much?
This times this.
Ninety-nine bucks.
- Aah!
- Aah!
- What is the matter?
- We won!
He means the Flyers.
Sudden death overtime goal.
Very exciting.
You guys act like you had money on the game.
Oh, mom.
What is this?
Breathe in.
You oK, Mrs. Matthews?
Huh?
oh, yeah.
I'm fine.
I was just thinking I got to get a sitter for Monday night.
Breathe out.
I started babysitting when I was around twelve and you're almost twelve.
Maybe you could stay with Morgan.
The job pays $2.00 an hour.
Whew.
Two bucks that's a lot of money.
Mom, you know what?
Keep the two bucks and buy yourself a nice dress.
Gee, thanks, Cor.
OK, Monday night.
I'll take a chance on you.
Whew.
You almost spilled the beans to Boom-Boom.
Hey, we just won a hundred bucks.
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Hah!
- Hah!
& Doo doo doo doo doo & & Doo doo doo doo doo & & Doo doo doo doo & Come here, guys.
Now would this bother you?
All right.
Your name is Brianna Henshaw.
You're the best-looking girl in school.
So one day you see me accidentally stumble into your best friend Debbie and inadvertently French-kiss her.
Now you won't go out with me.
Why won't you go out with me?
I'm a little bit country.
You're a little bit rock 'n' roll.
Hey, Eric, you like this girl well, then, you got to take a big risk.
- I know about this.
- oh, you do?
Well, I'm always eager to get romantic advice from a fetus.
The point is, you're never going to win her over unless you do something bold, unless you take a risk.
That's how I live my life.
I'm Risk Boy.
After careful market analysis product testing, and strategic planning we bet on Tuna Melt to win.
You gambled with your $10?
- It's $1,000.
- oh, right, right.
You invested your money on a racehorse?
And we won.
Call the police, Mr. Feeny.
It's illegal for minors to bet.
Well, now, he has a point, Mr. Matthews.
Yes, he does.
Good point, little nerdling.
Except in this assignment we're supposed to be businessmen and businesswomen.
And as we all know it's perfectly legal for men and women to play the ponies.
Mm-hmm.
Although I don't condone gambling in any form Mr. Matthews and Hunter have demonstrated a basic tenet of American free enterprise the bigger the risk, the bigger the reward.
- Risk, risk, risk.
- Reward, reward, reward.
Oh, please.
I think they were very bold.
Gold digger.
A hundred bucks and an "A".
It just doesn't get any better than this.
I am a dating god.
Worship me.
Ignore him.
Maybe his big head will float him upstairs.
I was bold, I took a risk and now I got a date with Brianna Henshaw.
And you should be saying thank you to whom?
The Helco Locker Company of Madison, Wisconsin.
- Why?
- I stuffed myself in her locker.
Eric, when I said take a risk I didn't want you to become a stalker.
I only had to wait in there for, like, three periods.
I mean, she came back from math, and there I was her compact bundle of love.
The greater the risk, the greater the return.
What's this?
"Dear Pooh-bear " From mom to dad.
Ooh.
Boom-Boom's reply.
"Blue is the violet, red is the rose.
"Wear that sexy cologne, and meet me at 8:00 at the place where you proposed.
" Poetry is not Boom-Boom's strong suit.
Poetry.
Girls love poetry.
Uh, there once was a guy in a locker Who just got a date what a shocker.
You are a real chip off the old Boom-Boom.
Hey, Shawn, can you reach your Uncle Frank right now?
Yeah.
Why?
Because I have wasted the last twelve years of my life.
Huh?
"Don't swim after you eat.
Don't read in the dark.
Don't stick your head in the ball return.
" What are you talking about?
I've been playing it safe all my life and where's it gotten me?
Here in a room with you.
Thanks a lot.
I'm talking about risk, Shawn.
Big risk big reward.
Bigger risk bigger reward.
Feeny finally taught us something that we can use.
Call your uncle.
You want to risk our hundred bucks?
I Want to live.
The FLyers swept by MontreaL.
6-3.
Forget the stinking Flyers.
Give me the fifth race at Pimlico.
And now the results of the fifth race at PimLico.
Come on, Neck Flap, baby!
And the winner is N Nuh?
What kind of name is Nuh?
You idiot!
You ripped the plug out of the wall.
Well, he said Nuh.
It's got to be Neck Flap.
What other horse starts with Nuh?
OK, we got Neck Flap, Nux Vomica Nunzio's Dream, and, remarkably a horse called Nuh.
Come on, get on the horn and call your uncle.
Gus, Shawn.
Give me Frankie Two Toes.
Frankie Two why is he called Frankie Two Toes?
Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
Uncle Frank, how'd our horse do?
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
What?
What's the matter?
I knew we shouldn't have bet on Neck Flap.
All the smart money was on Nuh.
I know, I know.
We lost it all.
Uncle Frank says We just lost all our money, because we took a risk.
Because We didn't play it safe.
I'll never take another risk as long as I live.
We just won six hundred and eighty bucks.
Let it ride!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Let's count it again.
It's been 680 bucks the last 12 times.
Don't you love twenties?
I'm going to go get us a pizza.
Fine.
Go.
But get a receipt.
This is a business dinner.
Two-to-one, that phone rings again.
I can't lose.
Matthews and Hunter, entrepreneurs.
Oh, hi, mom.
No.
Dad left forty minutes ago.
He was dressed real nice for Valentine's Day.
You're going to love him.
All right, got to go.
Time is money.
You're busted!
I didn't do anything illegal.
Look, I know you're new at this, so I'll cut you a break.
You're supposed to entertain me!
Forget it, you rug rat.
Five-to-one it's dad.
Hello.
Hi, dad.
Ho, I'm good!
No.
Mom just called for you.
Well, I'm telling you, she's there.
She's probably in the next phone booth.
OK, bye.
Man, I can't believe mom and dad can't find each other.
How big is this restaurant?
Mom, dad just called and Shawn?
What?
Are you kidding me?
Lenny Dykstra?
Keep him there.
I don't know, tie him to a chair.
OK, bye.
Morgan, get your coat.
Come on, Morgan.
We got to hurry.
Lenny Dykstra's having dinner at Bob Stubchek's Pizza World.
You wouldn't play with me, I'm not going with you.
Morgan.
Morgan.
Morgan, come out of there.
No!
Morgan, if I can get these baseball cards signed they're worth a fortune.
What do you say?
What part of "no" don't you understand?
Morgan, come on.
He's halfway through his pizza.
Do you understand how important this is?
Fine, Morgan.
You want to stay in there?
I bet you five cupcakes that you can't stay in this house all by yourself without getting into any trouble.
Six cupcakes.
You're on.
I'll be right back.
Cool.
I hold in my hand one dozen freshly signed mint-condition Lenny Dykstra rookie cards.
Getting more valuable every second.
They're more valuable now now, now.
- Ka-ching!
- Ka-ching!
Wait a minute.
I didn't leave the front door open.
Uh-oh.
Morgan!
Morgan!
Shawn, Morgan's gone.
Oh, this is bad.
This is bad.
This is bad.
This is bad.
This is really bad.
This is - Mr. Feeny.
- Mr. Matthews.
I did a bad thing.
I did a terrible thing.
I thought I couldn't lose.
I took a risk I never should have.
Calm down, Mr. Matthews.
It's just imaginary money.
No, but it was my real baby sister.
I took a chance and left her by herself.
Someone broke in and kidnapped her.
- Morgan's in the tree house.
- What?
Morgan!
This is bad.
This is bad.
This is bad.
Morgan.
It's oK.
It's me.
- Too tight.
- Sorry.
Here.
I did a bad thing.
No, you didn't.
I did a bad thing.
I never should've left you alone.
I broke a Window.
Well, no one's going to know that because I'll tell mom and dad that I did it.
Why?
Well, if I hadn't left you alone it never would've happened, so it really is my fault.
I promise, I won't let you be in trouble with mom and dad, oK?
OK.
I hope you don't plan on going into babysitting professionally.
ALan.
it was humiliating.
How could you go to the wrong restaurant?
Or was proposing to me that forgettable?
I can only say I'm sorry so many times.
How could you forget something so important?
You're right.
I am the crass, unfeeling dunderhead who forgot that I proposed to you at Chez Lafleur.
Yes, you are.
And I may forgive you in time.
What restaurant did you go to anyway?
Can't we just forget about this just get on to the romantic part of the evening?
Mm-hmm.
Just tell me.
Where did you go?
I Went to Phil's Grill.
Phil's grill?
That's oh.
What?
"oh"?
Come on.
Let's go inside.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.
That was a big mistake.
"oh.
" Can't we just get on with the romantic part of the evening, Pooh-bear?
No, wait a minute.
No, no, no.
Don't you Pooh-bear me.
I did propose to you at Phil's Grill, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- ooh, I knew it!
I knew it.
What happened at Chez Lafleur?
I was proposed to at Chez Lafleur.
Not by me.
Are you hungry?
I'm so hungry.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Who proposed to you at Chez Lafleur?
- Mark BraithWaite.
- Mark BraithWaite?
Mark BraithWaite proposed to you?
Who is Mark Braithwaite?
- Some guy.
- Some guy?
Some random drive-by proposal?
Somebody proposed to you, and you didn't tell me about it?
- No.
- Why not?
Oh, 'cause silly me, I thought maybe you'd get angry.
Oh, well, fine.
obviously you know me.
I don't know you.
Alan!
Did you accept the proposal?
Do you have another set of children in Muncie, Indiana?
Are Vera, Chuck, and Dave waiting for their mother to come back after stepping out for gum eighteen years ago?
"So the velveteen rabbit said, 'I am a real rabbit.
"' - Alan.
- Amy, if that's your real name.
Cory, what happened?
It's all my fault.
No one else is to blame except me.
But don't worry, dad.
I'm going to pay for it out of my own money.
Your own money?
How are you going to do that?
Well, I would tell you but the yelling and screaming that would happen would only wake up my dear little sister who, thank God, is still alive.
Well, based on performance figures to date it seems as though the Matthews-Hunter Consortium is our most profitable corporation.
So, gentlemen, do you have any business tips for our other young entrepreneurs?
Yeah.
Some people bet on a jockey.
I say, "Give me a horse that can run in the mud.
" oh, bravo.
Anything to add, Mr. Matthews?
Yes.
The greater the risk the greater the potential profit.
Just like you taught us, Mr. Feeny.
Yes, but sometimes the glitter of the profit makes one lose sight of the risk.
And you should never gamble anything that you can't afford to lose.
- I didn't teach you that.
- No, you didn't.
I kind of managed to trip over that one myself.
You know, Stu, I was so busy counting money yesterday I completely forgot to give you your valentine.
So here.
No hard feelings, eh, big brain?
Should I open it?
I know it's just going to be insulting and mean.
Sticks and stones may break your bones but words can never hurt you.
I made that up.
Mm-hmm.
- "Happy Valentine's Day.
" - Ah.
"Turn around.
" Here, mom.
What's this?
It's all the money Shawn and I had left over after we paid for the vase and the door.
And you spent it on me?
Easy come, easy go.
Is that from Mark BraithWaite?
No.
It's from Cory Matthews.
Well, in case it gets lonely.
Pooh-bear, they're beautiful.
Why?
Because this was the worst Valentine's Day of my life.
Including the time that Margie Dwyer told all the girls in fifth grade I had cooties and they threw my cards away.
Oh.
And I was thinking that you may have been proposed to twice but you only said yes once and I'm glad it was me.
Happy Valentine's Day, Boom-Boom.
So What makes you think I was only proposed to twice.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
- Hi, Dad.
- Whoa, ho, ho.
What, baseball?
In this storm?
I don't think so.
Dad, that's a drizzle.
A thundery, stormy kind of drizzle.
Mm-hmm.
Forget it, wise guy.
Find something to do around here.
I've been sitting inside all day.
What am I supposed to do for fun?
Have tea with your sister.
- I made red zinger.
- Yeah, zing this.
Somebody needs a nap.
My life bites boring, predictable never a surprise.
Don't turn on the lights.
Shawn?
The cops are after me, maybe even the FBI.
You're not involved, unless you want to be.
I'm in!
You can't tell anybody I'm here.
Right, right.
How'd you get in here, anyway?
I climbed up the tree into your window.
I didn't want anyone to see me.
Cory, I'm a fugitive.
Fugitive?
Cool!
Give me details.
OK.
You remember that cherry bomb?
Oh, no.
Feeny found it.
You're suspended!
Nothing good ever happens to me.
All day I kept feeling it in my pocket all round and waxy, just begging me to light it.
I mean, I could actually hear it saying "Light me.
Light me, Shawn.
Blow something up.
" Well, what did you blow up?
Well, I was riding my bike down "K" Street You blew up "K" Street?
- I park at the Market Giant - You blew up the Market Giant?
That's my dad's store.
I have mixed feelings.
But there on the ground by the shopping carts a matchbook.
It was like a sign, you know, saying, "Now, Shawn.
Now.
Let the sucker blow.
" So you're holding the lit cherry bomb I don't remember lighting it.
But suddenly there it was in my hand sparks flying off the fuse and suddenly, I realized, this thing's going to go off.
I mean, I could lose an eye, lose an arm wind up looking like our shop teacher.
So why didn't you just throw it?
There were people all around.
I could've hurt somebody.
I just knew I had to get it far, far away, so I mailed it.
You blew up a United States mailbox?
Well, it's still standing although the sides did puff out like a fat guy burping.
All the stuff inside got torched though.
You should have seen the flames and the freaked-out look on people's faces.
Why am I never around when the great stuff happens?
I think I shook the cops.
What do I do now?
I can't go home.
Why not?
It wasn't like you did it on purpose.
Look, I did it.
That's the only part my old man's going to hear.
I stepped over the line this time, Cory.
I'm going to get killed for this.
What are you going to do?
You think I could stay here for a couple days just until I figure things out?
Fine with me.
I'll go ask my mom.
You're really new at this, aren't you?
What?
No one can know I'm here, especially not your folks.
They'll tell my mom and dad.
Oh, right, right, right.
What about Eric?
He's dumb, but I think he'll notice a third guy in the room.
I'll hide in the closet.
Have you seen my closet?
OK, under the bed.
OK, but you may not be the only living thing under there.
Hi.
How are you doing?
Jeez, how do you live like this?
Cory.
dinner!
So what do you say?
Can I stay?
Of course you can.
Now get out of that wet stuff and put on some of my clothes.
I'll sneak up some food.
Remember, I'm your accomplice.
I'm Accomplice Boy.
- Thanks a lot, man.
- No, thank you.
It's about time there's a little excitement around here.
Listen.
Listen, Cor.
You're going downstairs to keep something from your parents and if it was me, I wouldn't worry but I know you.
You're going to act weird.
Attempt to stay cool, huh?
Cool?
Me?
Ha!
They won't notice a thing.
Dad and Mom, I have so much homework.
I'm going to eat in my room, and I need fuel.
I need lots of fuel.
I need enough fuel for two although there's only one of me which is so interesting, don't you think?
Cory, you're grounded for two weeks.
What did I do?
I don't know, but the way you're behaving it's got to be at least two weeks.
Dad, I can honestly tell you I haven't done a thing.
What was that?
My homework fell off my desk.
There's so darn much of it.
Ha ha ha.
OK.
What are you, bowling up here?
Shawn?
I guess my pants are a little short on you.
No, no, no, they fit great.
Anyone ever tell you you're built like a chimp?
Did anybody ever tell you don't insult the boy with the food?
No ketchup?
I always have ketchup on my meat loaf.
Oh, you're absolutely right.
I'm going to go downstairs right now and tell my mom that Shawn the cherry bomb mailbox killer would like a little ketchup on his meat loaf.
Fine, fine.
I'll eat this dry meat brick.
- Oh, Cory!
- Hide!
Think you're pretty smooth, don't you?
- I know what's going on.
- You do?
Uh-huh.
Smuggling food, strange noises, the smell in here.
Smell?
Yeah, I tried the same thing once.
You're hiding a puppy, huh?
Where is he?
Come here, puppy.
Where's the cute little boy?
Oh, it's a big puppy.
OK, Eric, you're right.
I'm hiding a puppy, but I let it go.
- When?
- Uh, just a minute ago.
- You let the puppy go?
- Uh-huh.
Out a second story window?
What was I thinking?
Hey, guys.
Mom, where are you going?
It's time for Morgan's bath and her door to the bathroom is locked.
Wait a minute.
Let me get this straight.
You're going into the bathroom to give Morgan a bath?
Nothing gets past you.
Hey, Cor?
Lassie came home.
I can explain What he's doing.
No, no, no.
Look, I don't even want to know.
I mean, if I know the truth I only have to lie when questioned.
I don't want to know anything about you two.
Let's just cut to my bribe, shall we?
Dry brick of meat?
Yeah, that's tempting but I was thinking, oh, I don't know you two take over all my household chores?
In the bizarro World.
Eric, I don't even do my own chores.
Cory!
Eric!
Trash night.
Whose turn is it to take out the cans?
You know, Dad, an interesting thing.
See, we were just oh, no!
My turn, right?
Oh.
Hey, thanks.
I think Shawn was making a daring political statement.
And what statement was that, build more prisons?
You guys don't know anything about it.
Sorry I'm late.
I see you've all heard about Mr. Hunter's little stunt yesterday.
I just spoke with his parents.
Evidently, Shawn didn't come home last night.
I imagine no one here has heard from him.
Me?
What makes you think I heard from Shawn?
I was addressing the entire class.
Yeah, but you make it sound like I lit the cherry bomb and stuck it in the mailbox on "K" Street near the Market Giant.
I'm guessing.
He claims he hasn't spoken with Shawn since the incident yet he knows the precise location knows Hunter's plot involved a cherry bomb.
I smell conspiracy.
I smell cover-up.
I smell a nerd with nine fingers.
Mr. Matthews, unhand that Minkus.
Mr. Minkus, return to your seat.
Now, then, we shall continue reading aloud from page 157.
Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-tale Heart.
"They heard.
They suspected.
" "They knew.
" "I couLd bear those hypocritical smiles no Longer.
"I feLt that I must scream or die "and now.
hark.
again.
"Louder.
Louder.
Louder.
" Mr. Matthews?
Anything wrong?
& You made me Love you & & I didn't wanna do it & Ow.
& I didn't wanna do it & Ow.
& You made me want you & I checked outside the store.
I didn't see it anywhere.
- See what?
- Uh, it.
It?
It Italy.
I didn't see Italy.
I didn't see France.
I didn't see anybody's underpants.
Well, consider yourself lucky.
I just did the laundry.
And while I was putting it away I discovered a little something you've been hiding.
What?
You organized your closet.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Practically cleaned itself.
So why don't you just give me a hug and move along?
OK.
I'll just leave you here all by yourself.
Bye.
In the last twenty-four hours I almost blow off my hand and get sucked into a Hoover.
You organized my closet?
Yeah, well, I didn't mean to.
Just what was I supposed to do in this room all day?
Let me tell you, you have a very up-to-date collection of video games.
I especially enjoyed Pong.
Feeny said your parents came by school.
You didn't say anything, did you?
Well, he was working me, all right, but I was a stone.
- Cory!
- Yeah!
I'm alone!
Hide.
I fear for my life.
Hey.
How was your day?
Quit pumping me!
I know nothing!
Well, me I had a lousy day.
You see, yesterday I put about, oh twenty-six bills in the mailbox outside my store, and today I found out that, uh Well, you know the rest.
Yeah, I heard something along the lines of a mailbox natural disaster.
You know, the glue on those stamps is highly flammable.
I heard that Shawn may be involved to the extent that, um, he did it.
Huh.
Nowthat I did not hear.
Ah-choo!
- Bless you.
- Thank you.
You know, when I was growing up there was a kid in my neighborhood who was a lot like Shawn always getting into trouble.
You know, small things at first shoplifting candy, letting air out of tires but pretty soon, he got kind of bored moved on to more serious stuff, more dangerous.
Dad, Shawn's not like that.
I don't know.
I think he is.
And if he were here right now, I'd come down on him very hard.
Uh!
Uh, that meat loaf.
Because what Shawn did was irresponsible and dumb.
How come you're telling me this?
Because you need to know that if you ever do anything wrong you can always come home.
I don't care how bad it is it can never be as bad as not coming home.
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I'm a come-homer.
Fine, because I don't care how tight a spot you're in Ooh!
We're here for you.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Oh, man.
Your dad really hurt me.
That stuff he said?
No.
He sat on my head.
You know, Shawn I bet ifWe explained to my dad how this happened he could talk to your dad, and then No way.
I can't ever go home, Cory.
Didn't you hear what my dad was saying?
Not all of it.
I blacked out a couple times.
All I'm saying is I think that if both our dads worked together and talked it over, and my dad explained to your dad - that you're still an oK kid - it won't work, Cor.
Why not?
Because my dad will kill your dad just to get to me.
Shawn, you're overreacting.
Cory, all our lives we've done these little things but we've always stayed on this side of the line.
What line?
The line that separates the little bad from the big bad the line I blow up with my cherry bomb.
Shawn, you're wrong.
Watch.
I'll prove it to you.
Dad?
Dad, can you come here a second?
- No!
Cory!
- Dad?
All right, my dad's coming.
He'll fix everything.
Shawn?
Shawn!
Hey, Hunter!
Shawn!
OK, he's gone.
You think he's going home?
I think everything's going to be oK.
- Know why?
- Why?
Well, because that talk you gave me up in my room well, you didn't know it, but Shawn heard the whole thing.
Really?
Yeah, he was under my bed.
- Under your bed?
- Not the one I sat on?
Actually, I've been hiding Shawn up there since yesterday afternoon.
- How long have you known?
- Since yesterday afternoon.
The noises coming from your room.
The food you snuck upstairs.
It could've been a puppy.
Cory, no one is that naive.
Uh, I happen to like the puppy theory.
Mr. Feeny saw Shawn sneak in yesterday and he phoned us to let us know.
It's a conspiracy an international adults' hot line.
Any kid anywhere makes a move the phones are ringing.
Wait.
You guys didn't tell Shawn's parents, did you?
Of course we did.
Cory, didn't you think how scared Shawn's parents would be not knowing where their son was?
Wait, I don't get it.
If you guys knew all along, why didn't you bust us?
Sure would've been easier on me.
It was killing me trying to hide this from you.
Well, we knew he was safe here with his best friend who we hoped would help him make the right decision and go home.
Cor, I know you really like Shawn.
I mean, he's been your best bud since he taught you how to pick the lock on your playpen but there's something I think you should know about him.
You think he's a criminal.
I think he has rough edges.
I think he's at a point in his life where he can go one of two ways.
Back on my side of the line or gone forever into cherry bomb land.
Cory, Shawn has always reminded your dad of someone he knew when he was a kid.
You had a best friend like Shawn?
Uh-uh.
I was like Shawn.
I had a best friend like you.
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.
And when I was about twelve years old I got into trouble once, and I considered my options I could hop a train to California.
I could start my life at thirteen get a job at fourteen, be married at fifteen have kids at sixteen.
I thought it was a great idea.
Sounds like a dumb idea to me.
Oh, you think so, huh?
Yeah.
Just because you make one little mistake you don't want to throw your whole life away.
You see, guys like you and my best friend Richie that's the way you think.
Guys like me and Shawn we don't think like that.
- Did you ever go to California?
- No.
- Well, what happened?
- I don't know.
Somehow I ended up here in a room with you.
Listen, Shawn's going to get in touch with you.
What should I do when he does?
A kid like you you'll know.
Well, I guess the room is empty.
What a perfect time to set fire to my desk.
What, Cory told you I was here?
Did he rat on me?
On the contrary, Mr. Matthews has been a true and loyal ally.
If anybody has betrayed this friendship it was you the moment you asked him to lie.
I would have done the same for him.
Mr. Feeny, about the only thing I'm not worried about in my life right now is Cory and my friendship.
Oh, here we go.
I knew it was here somewhere.
In my eagerness to depart for the weekend I forgot to take it home.
What is it?
Canvas.
I often paint on the weekends.
Very strong material.
Difficult to rip.
Give it a try.
Go on.
Uh-huh.
of course, rugged as it is even the smallest snip and You see, Mr. Hunter once the integrity has been breached even the strongest fabric can unravel.
Even the strongest friendship.
Yeah, well, here.
Have a bandanna.
Aren't you going to turn me in?
Uh, no, I don't think I have to.
Oh.
It's not Monday?
All week long, you two ache to get out of this classroom and here you are in the middle of the night sneaking into it.
Did you bring the stuff I asked for?
It's empty.
How about some money?
Can I borrow your bike?
Actually, I got a ride here.
- Who from?
- Your mom and dad.
- They're here?
- They're parked outside.
Forget it.
I'm not going home.
You don't want to help me, that's fine.
I'll sneak out the back.
Get out of my way, Cory, or or else what, you'll hit me?
Fine.
Go ahead.
Wipe the floor with me.
- Cory, just get out of my way.
- No.
You have to go home, Shawn.
You can't run away.
Yes, I can!
Just get away from the door.
Shawn.
I'm not moving.
Cory, what do you want from me?
I want you to come back on my side of the line.
How am I supposed to do that?
Just go home.
My parents are going to ground me for, like, a year.
Well, then, I'll see you in a year.
Man, I'm going to get so killed.
Yeah, well, we're only twelve.
We live again.
- What day is it?
- The 19th.
It's Shawn!
- Aah!
- Aah!
I'm free!
- Ha!
- Ha!
& Doo doo doo doo do & & Doo doo doo doo do & A whole month!
How are you?
Oh, not too bad.
My eyes are still trying to adjust to the light though.
Are you hungry?
Nah, they gave me bugs with my potato today.
Whoa!
I hate to interrupt your touching reunion but there's one minute left in triple overtime.
Come on, Mom, you got to see this.
OK, I've got five more numbers to enter on this spreadsheet, and then I am done.
Oh, TV.
Hi.
Dawn, I know I've asked you out, like, fifty times and I know you said no, like, fifty times but you got to respect my willingness to get shot down.
You will?
Right now?
oK, where should I meet you?
- What happened?
- I had her!
- The game!
- Barbie's hair!
- I didn't save!
- Dad, what happened?
ALan.
didn't you pay the electric biLL?
Of course I paid it.
A month ago.
I put it in the mailbox right outside my store.
On cherry bomb day?
Good night, everybody.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Tonight is going to be the best night of our lives.
Mom and Dad gone.
Your brother date.
Who's left in charge?
Judy queen of zits.
We'll tell her she's looking especially broken out this evening So she'll spend all night in the bathroom squeezing her face Leaving us free to watch Barney salutes the alphabet?
That's just the box.
It's parent camouflage.
Outside, a happy purple sock.
Inside, the guts are flying.
Whoa!
I'm blowing Up Your Head.
Part 6 Stumpy's Revenge.
I thought Stumpy died in Part 5.
Well, that's why he wants revenge.
Cool.
ooh, "Barney Does the ABCs.
" You know, I don't want to ruin the ending for you, Cor, but, uh "Z".
You totally underestimate me.
Open it.
Ha.
Stumpy's Revenge.
Not bad for a baby scam.
This is not a baby scam.
This is a totally major scam.
"Stumpy's Revenge" is rated "R" For violence.
Yeah, maybe a little nudity?
Yeah, but we can fast forward over that.
All right, you're right.
It's a major scam.
But hey, if you're gonna do the crime be sure you're ready to do the time.
What do you mean?
Why do you think Mom and Dad are letting me go get my driver's license with Jason and his brother instead of with them?
Because they hope you'll get lost and never come back?
No.
Because they trust me.
See, I've spent my whole life putting deposits in the trust bank and today I'm cashing in.
What trust bank?
You get busted all the time.
Just a few, carefully selected times.
Enough so Mom and Dad think they're doing their job.
See, they know if something major happens I'll come to them.
Wow.
I never thought I'd say this but I could learn from you.
And maybe I can fit into this master plan of yours.
After you get your license we could drive downtown and check out that new baseball card shop on Third Street.
Excellent!
Yes!
Then we could go to the drive-thru and pick up a bucket of hot wings for me and Shawn to eat with the movie.
- Oh, yes!
- Yes!
Yes!
That's why I'm getting my license.
So I could bring my little brother to all the places he's ever wanted to go to.
Unless Jason and I have a date with two totally major babes.
oh, wait, we do.
But here's a lovely parting gift.
You doing your homework?
Mm-hmm.
It's still light outside.
What's going on?
I'm being responsible.
No, really.
What's going on?
Ta-da!
What do you think?
Uh Danger!
Danger, Will Robinson!
What's the problem?
Clean shirt, new jeans, jacket.
I look good.
Alan, tonight is really important to me.
All the real estate biggies in Pennsylvania are gonna be there and they're kind of a non-casual bunch.
How dressed up do you have to be to be bored to death?
Put on a suit.
If you die of boredom then I won't have to change your clothes for your funeral.
Can't I just stay home spend some quality time with my kids, huh?
No!
I mean, you don't want to let Mom down, right?
Oh, come on, son.
How does a night of bonding with your dear old dad sound?
Pretty good, huh?
Great, yeah.
It sounds great.
So I'll meet you halfway.
You go with Mom and I'll miss the heck out of you.
I am so proud to be the best friend of the first guy in history to fail his driver's test before it started!
The DMV guy waved me forward.
I pulled up, like, two inches.
That was not the DMV guy.
That was the father of the kid ahead of you.
How am I supposed to know that?
I'm at the DMV.
I assume the guy waving me forward is the DMV Guy.
Eric, DMV guys are cops, oK?
They don't usually wave you forward with a can of beer.
Hello?
Oh, hey, Tracy.
Yeah, there's some bad news.
Um, I went Tracy, how you doing?
Bad news?
oh, uh the cash machine only gave us Oh, you, uh you bought a new dress?
Oh, you hope it's not too short.
Sweetheart, life can be too short But dresses, no.
Heh heh heh heh.
I'll pick you up tonight at 8:00.
What are you saying to her?
We cannot pick them up until I take the driving test again in two weeks.
OK, that's just logic.
That's getting in our way.
Look Ahem.
Hey, looking good, Mr. M. Hey, guys.
Hey, how's the road warrior?
Dad, look, about the He got off to kind of a rocky start but, you know, once he had his foot on the accelerator, next thing you knew it Was over.
Ha ha.
Attaboy!
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Nope.
No letting down here.
Not the father, not the friend and not two lovely babes in drafty apparel.
Jason, I have to tell him.
Yes, you do.
That is the right thing to do.
And tomorrow is the right day to do it.
Ahem.
Rrrr.
Ow!
Whoo!
Too young to be a mom.
Too pretty to be in real estate.
Why are you sucking up to my mom?
Hey, have you seen my mom?
You know, son, I was thinking somebody in this house should have a good time tonight.
Those are your car keys.
Mm-hmm.
- Dad, I - Eric, Eric, his car keys.
Your father is giving you his car keys.
You know, someday I hope I can be half the man you are.
Well, right now you are.
No leaving this house until Judy gets here.
I am not lying to my parents.
I mean, they trust me.
They gave me life.
They deserve better from me.
OK, you got that out of your system?
Yeah.
What's the plan?
You are gonna drive us on the date.
Hello?
oh, hi, Judy.
Yeah.
How are you?
What?
You can't.
You can't.
You can't.
She did.
- Did what?
- She bailed.
She's not gonna babysit tonight.
We're dead.
No, we're not dead.
All's we have to do is find another babysitter.
Where are we gonna find another babysitter on fifteen minutes notice?
Mr. Feeny.
Hello, Eric.
I was wondering if you could help me out with a problem I've got.
Always happy to assist a former student.
See, our babysitter canceled, so Judy Horn?
Yeah.
Some kind of a skin crisis.
I don't even want to think about what a crisis for her would be.
Her whole head would have to pop.
Uh, anyway, I'm going to a classical music concert with a friend You?
Classical music?
Beethoven or Prokofiev?
Uh, Beethoven.
Symphony or concerto?
Uh, symphony.
Blonde or brunette?
Blondes Brahms.
Ah, so the real situation is that you have a date, but you can't go until you find a replacement babysitter.
Within the next ten minutes.
Oh, well, you have quite a time crunch, don't you?
Name your price.
Manual labor spreading manure in my yard for the next four sundays.
Two sundays.
- Five.
- Done.
Yes, I would love another cup of tea, thank you.
And would you like to try on my new floppy hat?
No, Morgan.
Now, here I really must draw the line.
I will not put on your floppy hat.
Now, that's not going to work.
We had an agreement.
I was to get dressed up and come to your tea party.
And then you were to leave me in complete peace so that I could grade my papers.
Now, I have upheld my part of the bargain.
I have festooned myself in costume jewelry.
I have swilled your faux tea.
Now, I insist that you keep your end of the bargain.
Oh, all right.
All right.
Give me the hat.
Happy now?
Uh-huh.
What's that?
My mix-and-bake cake is ready.
Oh, well.
I rush on winged feet.
So.
aLL previous theories of the migratory pattern of the Arctic caribou are shattered by the startling discovery that not one.
but two arctic caribou here where there were previously not one.
but none.
.
ALL right.
college girL in the shower kiss your head goodbye.
No!
Stumpy!
No!
Why did Stumpy just blow up her head?
Well, that's a tough one, Cor.
Stumpy's a pretty complex guy.
Here We are.
.
After the infant caribou is delivered the mother Licks it free of the birth fluids.
- Eww!
.
- Eww!
.
Oh, buck up.
You're watching the glorious tapestry of nature.
.
ALL right.
buxom night nurse.
Say hasta La vista to your head.
No.
Stumpy!
Not the crossbow!
No!
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
Ooh, she blowed up real good.
Bean dip?
Wonder if Eric's having as good a time as we are.
Are you kidding?
Having fun is what he's best at.
Please give me back my daddy's car.
There has to be some shred of humanity in you.
What does that mean, uh, humanity?
All right.
Mr. Feeny will be here in a few minutes.
Now, um, excuse me, mister sir, I still don't understand why you can't give us the car.
I mean, we have the money.
Oh, so I should just hand over a vehicle to any yutz who has forty bucks.
You want the car, then I need to see the address on your driver's license matches the address on your vehicle registration.
Then I'm happy.
Make me happy.
I got a junior with a Camaro.
Should we take it?
Anything to get out of here.
You know, I really learned a lot tonight.
Like What?
White curb good, red curb bad?
No, I learned that girls like you are only interested in using people.
And you know something?
We're glad you found a junior with a Camaro, because we don't need you.
They think they don't need us.
Poor naive lambs.
Tony with a "Y '," huh?
That's cool.
It was my mother's idea.
So, uh, what can I do for you girls?
Our friend left his license at home.
And we know you're not supposed to But we thought maybe you could give him his car anyway.
Our moms would be so worried if we're not home by curfew.
So, you'll just be needing the one car?
Yep, just one little itty-bitty car.
But we may be back, Tony with a "Y '".
Well, uh, here.
You give this to Vinnie at the impound lot and, uh, he'll give you the car.
That was amazing.
You girls are unbelievable.
Yeah, we are.
Wait a minute.
Aren't these the guys who don't need us?
Yeah, well, then I guess they can get back their pathetic dad-mobile all by themselves.
- No!
- No!
No!
Tape!
Tape!
Sounds like a Camaro.
Oh, Mr. Feeny.
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.
I wish I could say the same.
What seems to be the problem?
Dad's car got towed.
And we can't get it back from Sasquatch.
Oh, I'll clear this up in no time.
Excuse me, young man.
It's, uh, Tony with a "Y '".
Fine, Tony.
Might I inquire why you won't release the car?
It's like I told the kid you ain't got a license, you ain't getting the car.
Aren't.
What?
You aren't getting the car.
Wrong, pal.
I already got the car.
No, no.
You misunderstand me.
I was simply correcting your grammar.
I don't need talking lessons from a guy who's wearing an earring.
Could we get back to the car issue, please?
The issue is, no license, no car.
Capisce?
Eric, why don't you just give the man your driver's license?
Because I, uh I don't have it.
Well, tell me where you left it, and I'll go get it.
Ahem.
Well, I don't, uh, technically like, at this actual point in time He doesn't have a license.
He's got to.
Not even my brother's that big an idiot.
I, uh beg to differ.
Missy brush your teeth and go to bed.
You suck that lip back in.
Upstairs.
Now.
You, return to your home now.
Jason, you cannot leave me holding the bag for all this.
Ha ha ha.
See how little you know me?
And as for you, young man, I want you to go to your room and wait till your parents return.
Just because you were once my sixth grade teacher does not give you the right to tell me what to do.
Go to your room!
Apparently it does.
I don't suppose your parents have any Maalox in the house, do they?
What are you watching?
Uh uh it's caribou migrating and licking their babies.
Where's the remote?
Where's the remote?
.
ALL right.
fun-Loving stewardess coffee.
tea or bazooka sheLL?
Uh coffee?
No!
Ooh!
Why did that man just blow up her head?
- Uh, it's nature.
- It's human nature.
A rich tapestry of exploding heads.
That is cheap garbage.
Wait.
What are you doing?
No, Mr. Feeny.
our machine's kind of tricky.
No!
This is rated "R".
Yeah, "R" for wrecked.
Now Shawn's gonna have to pay for it.
- Shawn?
- Hey, you rented it.
George.
you're not supposed to be here.
What's wrong?
The babysitter canceled.
I'm doing my best to fill in.
He killed our tape.
What tape?
Good move.
Uh, tape?
There is no tape.
Did I say tape?
What was I thinking?
You were thinking "Good night, Shawn.
" Shawn, you cannot leave me here with this tape.
Heh.
See how little you know me?
I'm blowing Up Your Head.
Part 6?
From the little I saw Uh, no.
No, thank you, George.
I think I can figure out the subtle plot nuances.
You smuggled a violent "R" -rated movie into this house?
Oh, no, no, honey.
Calm down.
This may look like a violent film but at its heart, it's really a morality tale about an eleven-year-old boy who's in terrible, terrible, terrible trouble.
Dad, it's just a tape.
It's trash.
I don't Want it in the house.
Go to your room, Cory.
For how long?
Mom, I'm your son.
Cory, you're dog meat.
Uh, Mom, Dad.
Speaking of Puppy Chow Wait a minute.
You're not here.
My car isn't in the driveway.
You're out driving it somewhere very, very carefully, right?
Uh, Dad, I hope you're in a good mood.
You lose.
Ahem.
Uh, your car got towed away.
You are the worst babysitter that ever lived.
And your children are the spawn of Satan.
Honey, I think you should stay calm.
I am calm.
Under the circumstances, I'm the Dalai stinking Lama.
Eric, where is the car?
It's at the impound station.
I have the forty bucks to bail it out.
Great, but I'll have to drive you down there So we can get it home.
Actually, you both will have to drive him.
Why?
Because one of you is gonna have to drive Mom's car back and one of you is gonna have to drive your car back.
Why?
He hasn't got a driver's license.
Well my work is done.
I'll just leave.
Tip?
No?
Well, then, all right.
I, uh I sort of failed my driving test.
But you still decided to sort of drive my car without a license.
Well, you're going to get your license.
And then I'm going to take it away.
You are gonna be a pedestrian for life, pal.
Go to your room, Eric.
No, I'm not finished with him yet.
I haven't started with him yet.
But I want to talk with you now.
Is my authority being undermined?
Would I do that in front of your son?
Go to your room.
- No good.
- What, no good?
Who drives Morgan to gym class?
Who drives Cory to little league?
Who drives Eric on a tristate search for the perfect flannel shirt?
Me.
I take these kids everywhere.
I help when I can.
I mean Well.
I want Eric to get his license.
I have been waiting for this for sixteen years.
So how are we supposed to punish him?
Look, Eric sees driving as nothing but dates with cheerleaders open road, unlimited freedom.
But I am seeing his driving as trips to the dry cleaners and the supermarket and taking his brother and sister wherever they want to go.
I never should've tried to scam them.
Crime doesn't pay.
Violence is bad.
They're gonna kill me.
Cor, just be happy it was a baby scam.
Mine, on the other hand, was a megascam a hyperscam, the mother of all scams.
I am truly a dead man.
These could be our last few precious moments together.
Is there anything you want to say to me?
Yeah.
Here's a lovely parting gift.
Ooh!
- Cory - Eric Dad Mom I think you know why we're here.
And I think you know why we're here.
This is the sentencing phase of the proceedings.
I'm the oldest.
Do me first.
Both of you are grounded for two weeks.
Aah!
Two weeks?
Grounded?
That's horrible!
There's more.
There's more.
During those two weeks, you will do nothing but study the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle handbook and you will pass your driver's test.
I'll try.
You'll pass.
I'll pass.
And what will I do for two weeks?
Oh, you're going to watch TV.
Cool.
Educational TV, and nothing but educational TV starting right now.
.
The caribou marks its territory by defecating and flinging its dung.
Eww!
.
Come on, I'll be late for gymnastics.
Eric, come on.
Little league starts in twenty minutes and we have to stop at the cleaners to pick up my uniform.
I want to stop for frozen yogurt.
And we have to pick up Shawn and we have to stop and get pizza because you're the snack mom.
How shall I spend my afternoon?
Should I read magazines and then soak in the tub or should I soak and then read?
Soak and read, read and soak.
Hi, hon.
How was your day?
Ahh, bliss.
It's good to have a son who drives.
- Little league!
- Frozen yogurt!
I'll drive off a bridge, I swear I will.
Take your mother's car.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
"The following is a list "of exciting extracurricular activities "offered to you, the student "by your Philadelphia Board of Education.
"Each student shall select one exciting activity "Vocabulary Club" Too exciting.
Mr. Matthews, please.
It wasn't me, it was Shawn.
Same thing.
All right, "Debate Team "Scuba Club "Upholstery Squad.
" Scuba Club?
Underwater adventure.
- I'm in.
- Me, too.
Well, I for one plan to stimulate my intellect and will therefore choose between the Vocabulary Club and the Debate Team.
I would enjoy communing with the creatures of the sea.
I choose scuba.
Slap me in a wet suit and throw me overboard.
Can anyone tell me what the acronym SCUBA is?
Mr. Matthews?
Duba?
Scuba duba.
Mr. Matthews, I have obviously failed you on so many levels.
An acronym is a pronounceable formation made by a combination of letters.
I told you.
So, now, can anyone tell me what SCUBA stands for?
Come on.
Someone take a stab at it.
Mr. Hunter, you haven't spoken since the fourth grade.
S-c-u-b-a.
What does it stand for?
Something's creepy under boat Andy.
Mr. Matthews was closer with duba.
Very well.
Take it away, Mr. Minkus.
No.
I beg your pardon?
I don't want to know everything.
I Want to fit in.
I want to be one of the normal stupid guys.
I'm going with duba.
All right.
Mr. Minkus obviously does not know.
Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
Thank you.
I hate myself.
You're not alone.
Hey, Cory, you got a box on your face.
Hey.
Get up.
Somebody just put a box on your face.
Cory, don't wake up!
There's no box on your face!
Huh?
You lie.
There is a box on my face.
What do you think it is?
I bet I know.
"For my little boy "who is about to become a little man.
"Happy birthday.
Love, Dad.
" It's not a buck knife.
No, it's not.
You got a buck knife.
I got a necklace.
Well, it's because Dad doesn't like you and wants you to leave.
But this is my "becoming a man" gift from Dad.
I feel very bad for me.
Yeah, well, get over it because, to Dad somehow these little trinkets are important.
You mean, I've got to act grateful?
That's right, and you got to wear this sucker.
For how long?
Well, Dad's still a relatively young man.
What am I going to do?
I'd say your only way out of this one is to get married, have kids, and pass it on.
I'm just going to pretend I never found it.
It was on your face.
I'm sorry, honey, but today our son's going to love me just a little bit more than he loves you.
Well, one day a year, I think I can handle it.
Yeah, it's not every day that a son gets his father's silver gloves.
You know, considering how many punches you took to this face you don't look too shabby.
- Mom, I'm late!
Did you sign - Yes, your permission slip.
You gonna listen to everything your scuba instructor tells you?
- Yeah, yeah.
- No goofing around with Shawn?
No, no.
How long after eating before going in that water?
Mom!
Whatever answer gets me in the pool.
- Thirty minutes.
- Half an hour.
- Deal.
- Hi, son.
Oh, hi, Dad.
Yeah, thanks for the little silver mittens.
They really mean a lot to me.
Really.
Bye.
Well, that's oK if he didn't like it.
You know, it's not like I gave it to him to get one of those Kodak moments.
I feel very bad.
Alan, love of my life did you by any chance explain to Cory the meaning of those silver gloves?
Not yet.
Well, then how's he supposed to know they're important?
I put them on his face.
Alan, Cory has no idea that you even won those gloves.
Hi.
What's on my face?
Nothing.
And what are we going to do about that?
Morgan.
Cory present, Morgan present.
Let's go.
I'll act surprised.
Morgan, honey, remember how you're no longer a baby?
Uh-huh.
I'm Mommy and Daddy's big girl.
That's right, and now that you're a big girl it's not hard for you to understand that you don't have to get a present every time it's somebody else's birthday.
But you always used to give me presents on Cory and Eric's birthdays.
That's because we didn't want you to feel bad, sweetie.
Well, I feel bad now.
Don't you cave in on me, mister.
Oh, come on.
Let me buy her love while I can still afford it.
Luke, I am your father.
What's that for, seeing out of submarines?
For breathing.
Didn't you ever go snorkeling?
No, never.
Did you?
Sure, in my bathtub.
You can totally see things growing down there.
You know, I was meant for this underwater life because I am Scuba Boy!
What?
Man, Cory, you're the whitest white boy I have ever seen.
Oh, yeah?
Let's see what you got.
Think I'm afraid to take my shirt off?
That's what I'm thinking.
I got nothing to hide.
I'm thinking that, too.
Yeah, well, let me warn you.
I've been working out.
I have pumped me up.
How come you're wearing a shirt?
Well, because otherwise I look like you.
It's not very evolved to ridicule the human form.
Each of our bodies is the master creation of Mother Nature.
Well, except for Minkus.
He was created by Mother Goose.
Anybody ready for a dip?
Yep, and here he comes.
Minkus, you look like a stick of Juicy Fruit.
You wearing a wet suit, too, Mother Nature?
No.
What's the matter?
No funny remarks?
Uh, you got anything?
I got nothing.
Uh, you got anything?
Snap out of it.
She's just a girl in a bathing suit.
Insult her.
No.
From now on, I'm gonna be insulting you.
- Topanga?
- Yes, Stuart?
You're beautiful.
That's very sweet, Stuart.
My superficial side thanks you.
What is Minkus doing?
I don't know, but he's doing it better than us.
Hey, what's with the necklace?
Oh, my dad gave it to me.
It's one of those really important father-son gifts that you don't understand what it is.
Been there.
My dad once gave me a gold-plated tire pressure gauge he won at the company bowling tournament.
Try getting psyched over that.
I wonder what happens when I pull this.
Now I know.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
You can endanger the safety of yourself and others.
No touching the equipment until the dive master gets here.
Yeah, who is this dive master anyway?
I don't care who it is, as long as it gets us out of school, underwater, and away from Feeny.
Good afternoon, fellow divers.
Aah!
Yes, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Hunter I'm a certified dive master and have been for years.
OK, I'm thinking Upholstery Club.
Now, the first rule of diving is never dive alone.
Therefore, I would like each of you to select a partner to be your diving buddy.
- Buddy?
- Buddy.
- Buddy?
- oK.
Oh, how cute.
It's the Little Mermaid and Aqua Nerd.
Now, one of our first drills will be buddy breathing where you share your regulator and breathe through the same mouthpiece.
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.
B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.
Did you brush your teeth this morning?
I'm not sure.
What day is it?
No, of course I know your name is Donna.
Vicky's just a little pet name I like to use.
You know, like honey, darling, Vicky.
You're going to hang up on me now, aren't you?
Yes, you are.
oK.
Hey, how come you're not wearing the little silver mittens Dad gave you?
What?
I must have left them at the pool.
No big deal.
I'll buy him another pair tomorrow.
Eric, scuba is so cool.
Look.
I stayed under the water for 20 minutes.
Your fingers look like Grandma's neck.
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Dad.
Cory, it occurred to me today that I never really explained to you about that gift I gave you this morning.
It's oK, Dad.
A gift like that doesn't really need explaining.
No, well, I explained to Eric about Grandpa's buck knife after I gave it to him.
Have I told you lately how much I love that knife, Dad?
You know, in the Navy, I was on the boxing team.
- Really?
- Yeah, I wasn't half bad either.
You used to get in the ring and duke it out with other guys?
What does this have to do with the silver mittens?
They're not silver mittens.
They're silver gloves.
I won them for coming in second place.
Is second place that good?
There's only two guys in the ring.
Not second place in one boxing match.
Second in my weight division in the entire United States Navy.
What?
Yeah.
That's why I'm so proud of those little silver gloves.
So, who'd you lose to, Dad?
The baddest, meanest, ugliest guy in the Navy.
I fought him in the championship fight.
Did you hear that, Cor?
The championship.
- I heard.
- This was a brutal fight.
- Was there blood?
- oh, buckets.
Buckets!
See, the funny thing is, I thought it was his blood.
I thought I had the fight won till the referee held up the other guy's arm.
See, my eye was kind of hanging out of its socket.
Which I should have realized because I was looking at his head and his shoes at the same time.
Boy, Dad, you really must have fought your heart out to win those little silver gloves.
Yeah, so I lost a little depth perception.
But to tell you the truth, Cor as good as it was to win those silver gloves what was great was hoping that someday I'd have a son to pass them on to.
And did you?
Yes, I did, huh?
I thought you guys'd just like to hear about it, so I'll see you at dinner.
See you, Dad.
No, they're not mittens on a chain, oK?
They happen to be the silver boxing gloves of the second best boxer in the whole United States Navy.
Yeah.
Yeah oK, thanks.
They're not at the comic book store either?
No.
They're nowhere in the whole world.
But I'm gonna find them.
I'm gonna retrace every step I took today.
You know, Cor, if you just kept them wrapped up like my buck knife none of this ever would have happened.
You told me to wear them!
Sometimes you got to know when to ignore me.
Huh?
Look.
I thought that knife didn't mean that much to you.
It doesn't.
I just make it look like it does.
I keep it wrapped up, and I polish it.
I mean, I might not be into it but maybe my kid will get a kick out of it someday, huh?
- Eric - Yeah?
I've got to find those gloves, and I need you to cover for me.
Just tell Mom and Dad I went to Shawn's for dinner.
- OK, you're covered.
- All right, thanks.
Hey, be careful.
Not that I care.
Cory, dinner.
Eric, where is your brother?
I don't know.
oh, no, wait, I do know.
He said he was going to Shawn's for dinner and I told him to go right ahead.
Oh, and you felt that that was in the realm of your authority?
I did.
After all, I am the oldest boy and, after tonight, quite possibly the only boy but I kid the family.
Come in.
Yeah, hi, Eric.
Good to see you, too.
Hello, Shawn.
How you guys doing?
Is Cory here?
No, of course he's not, Shawn.
As you well know, Cory's at your house having dinner.
Right, right.
Cory is at my house and I did know that.
Eric Would be correct there.
Well, then why are you here?
Why am I, as in me, here?
I think that's one Eric could handle.
Eric?
It's plain as day.
Sure.
oh, well, of course.
See, obviously Cory sent Shawn over here to see what we were having for dinner to decide if he made the wise choice in going to Shawn's house for dinner.
And why didn't he just call?
Ha ha!
Shawn, you're hurting me.
Pathetic.
No no, it's not pathetic.
It's not pathetic for me because I'm not in this family so I can leave.
Eric, what's going on?
Where's Cory?
I honestly don't know where Cory is.
Alan, it's after dark.
I'm kind of worried.
So am I. How is he going to survive in the adult world if he can't come up with a better cover story?
Mr. Matthews!
Mr. Matthews!
Mr. Matthews!
Uh-oh!
Mr. Matthews, didn't you hear a word I said today?
Diving alone is not only stupid, it's dangerous.
There isn't even a lifeguard on duty.
This has got to be the most half-baked idea you've ever had.
No.
no.
It was fuLLy-baked.
Look.
Mr. Feeny.
you have to Listen to me.
I Lost my father's silver gloves and I have to find them.
You're dripping on my oxfords.
Now put your clothes on and go home.
Cory!
Thank God you're alive!
Now I'm going to kill you.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I lost your silver gloves.
I didn't know how important they were to you.
Mr. Feeny just called and said you snuck into the "Y" and you were diving by yourself.
Is that true?
I tried to find the gloves.
Cory, I don't care about those gloves.
Dad, yes, you do.
You know you do.
Yes, I care about them.
That's why I gave them to you.
And when I was young and in the Navy they were the most important thing in the world to me.
But now I don't care if I lose those silly gloves.
I care if I lose you.
Huh?
You understand that?
Maybe it's best if I never leave home.
Bad things only happen when I leave.
Alan, he's grounding himself.
Don't let him take that away from us.
Sorry, Mom.
Go ahead and ground away.
Why don't you just go upstairs, dry off, and go to bed?
Amy.
- George.
- Alan.
Thanks for being there tonight, George.
Mr. Feeny, you didn't come over to yell at me more, did you?
No, I can wait until we're back in class for that.
I just thought that maybe you'd want these.
Mr. Feeny, I can't believe this!
This is great!
Thank you!
How did I get here?
We'll pretend it never happened.
Well, good night all.
Wait a minute.
How come it was oK for you to go diving without a buddy, but not for me?
I didn't have to go diving, Einstein.
They were in the filter.
You see what you give me to work with?
Dad, here.
What are you doing?
I gave these to you.
No.
I don't deserve them, at least not yet.
Just hold onto them for me now and give them back to me on the most important day of my life.
When will that be?
Whatever day you give them back.
You want me to lie to Mommy?
Of course not.
I don't want you to lie to Mommy.
I just want this to be a secret between you and me.
OK.
What is it?
Yes!
Go on.
open it.
Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, you're welcome.
What's the matter?
Did you win this horse when you were in the Navy?
No.
Then why is this important?
Well, it's important because you wanted it and I went to the store and I bought it for you with my money.
Did you win this horse when you were in the Navy?
Yes, I did.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Good morning, class.
I would like you all to let out your most agonized groan.
Aw Good.
Now, let's start planning our springtime class play.
ohh!
Been there, heard that.
Now, before you give up in despair you may want to hear my play selection.
It has sword fights, murder, skulls even ghosts.
- How does that sound?
- Sounds like Spielberg.
- Sounds like Shakespeare.
- Sounds like a loser.
We will be doing selected scenes from the play Hamlet.
Mr. Hunter, in the parlance of the theater you will be a spear carrier.
Excellent.
So this guy I play is like, what, a warrior and a hero?
No.
This guy you play has very few lines to memorize.
Miss Lawrence, you will be playing the tragic heroine ophelia.
Now, this is a challenging role.
She goes quite insane.
Topanga insane?
What a stretch.
If I were a less-evolved person, I'd say cram it, brillo-head.
Mr. Minkus you will be playing the role of the wise old Polonius.
Polonius?
He only has forty-eight lines.
I sort of pictured myself as the melancholy Dane.
For those of you unfamiliar with the reference Mr. Minkus means the lead role, Prince Hamlet.
Now, this is a tricky part to cast because Hamlet gets on a lot of people's nerves.
He makes one stupid mistake after another and for five acts he never shuts up.
What, do I have a booger?
Cory, I don't want to be a windmill anymore.
Morgan, you have to work with me.
I'm not going to be humiliated again in front of everyone on the Jersey shore.
You and Dad are going to get your butts kicked.
Not this year.
Mom and Eric's winning streak is over.
Over there?
Hey, Cor, can I borrow some cash?
You're the one with the job.
I'm Allowance Boy.
They cut our salaries Now, look, I could have gone to anybody for cash but I came to you because we're family.
I mean, we're like brothers.
You're the closest person in the world to me, Cor.
And your name is All right, look.
For five bucks, and you never tell Mom I'll throw the Goofy Golf tournament this year.
Hey, Dad and I don't need you guys to take a dive for us to win.
Ahem.
Yeah, you do.
"To be or not to be, that is the question.
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind "to suffer the slings and arrows of " Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Mr. Feeny, who wrote this garbage?
Some say Shakespeare's plays were written by a group of individuals but I don't necessarily believe that.
I personally subscribe to the Francis Bacon theory.
I go with the Jimmy Dean sausage theory.
Please continue, Mr. Matthews.
OK.
"To die, to sleep no more.
And by a sleep to say we end the heartache.
" Can I please stop whining and shove a sword through somebody's guts?
Yes, as soon as you get to the queen's chamber.
See, there's your problem right there.
You want murder, you want suspense you don't go to your mother's bedroom.
And how are you going to improve the greatest play in English literature?
Well, for starters let's set this thing in a burning skyscraper.
Then I could do sort of a Bruce Willis thing, you know?
Shooting Uzis, blowing away terrorists jumping out windows.
All this guy Hamlet does is talk.
He even talks when nobody's there.
Prince Hamlet finds himself in the middle of a terrible dilemma.
Whatever course of action he chooses could have dire consequences.
He is racked With indecision.
He is one of literature's most human characters.
You mean most wimpy characters.
Wimps talk, heroes do stuff.
The gospel according to Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Ah, ophelia, don't you look authentic.
Thank you, Mr. Feeny.
Here's your costume.
Jedidiah sewed it last night.
Wait a minute.
What was your dad thinking?
This is a minidress and pantyhose.
No, no.
Actually this is a doublet and tights which is how male actors dressed back in the 1600s, see?
You know, maybe if Hamlet had worn pants he could have made a decision or two.
Is that a sexist comment?
That's what I was shooting for.
Don't listen to her, Cor.
Her dad sews.
Now, listen.
Part of this assignment is to learn the classical style.
So doing the play in its original form will help with the lesson.
Here.
OK, Mr. Feeny, you don't want to listen to my ideas the kind of ideas that could make this play famous, fine.
But don't expect me to sit around like Hamlet did and take it.
Oh, and what do you propose to do?
I quitteth.
A stunning series of jabs from Matthews staggering an unsuspecting Feeny.
A simple move in the art of negotiation my little spear carrier.
- You think he'll give in?
- What choice does he have?
Without me, he'll have to cancel the play.
It's Less than a week away.
I mean, who else is he going to find who has my, dare I say, charisma?
Yeah, that and no one else knows all the lines.
Now I am alone.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I?
- You, Hamlet?
- Thou speaketh true.
Thou speaketh like Snagglepuss.
Melancholy Dane he was Danish.
Maybe I should do this with a Scandinavian accent.
Soft you now, the fair ophelia.
Nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered.
Wait till Feeny sees our Prince Haagen Dazs over there.
He's going to be begging me to come back to the play with my Uzi.
Coming to an elementary school near you Hambo.
Part Six To KiLL or Not to KiLL.
I just sank eighteen in a row.
You and Mom are Goofy Golf has-beens.
I think we'll just keep our trophy on the shelf.
The tournament has been canceled.
What?
Remember that 5% pay cut at the market?
Dad's pay got cut, too.
He says we can't afford to go away this year.
Eric, what are you talking about?
Dad's the boss.
He can do Whatever he Wants.
Dad!
Dad, what's this stuff about us not going to the Jersey shore?
Uh, well, sorry, Cor but Mom and I had to cancel that trip.
How come you did this pay cut thing now?
Well, it wasn't my decision.
Well, whose decision was it?
- Bob Williams.
- So just fire him.
I can't.
He's the boss.
I thought you were the manager.
Well, I am the manager, but he's the district manager.
Then above him there's a lot of other bosses.
Well, come on, Dad.
There must be something you can do.
Well, what do you suggest?
I suggest Dad can do anything he wants.
Well, there are other people to consider, Cor like my employees.
Yeah, but, I mean, you're not some spear carrier.
No, but I'm not exactly running the show, either.
Well, Dad, I think you should go in there and talk to them and if they don't want to do it your way, then just quit.
You think it's that simple, huh?
Yeah.
Throw a little weight around.
Trust me.
It feels good.
Alan?
Let me ask you something.
Do you think of me as a spear carrier?
You know, the trick to raising a 12-year-old is ignore him.
Can I ignore the people at work?
I mean, do they see me as good old "Do What He's Told" Alan Matthews?
Alan won't complain.
Alan's a company guy.
There he is, aisle four, with his spear.
Gee, I thought the spears were on aisle five.
I moved them next to the slings and the arrows.
No, but really, I really think I've got to do something here.
Well, I think we both know what you're going to do.
No, you don't know what I'm going to do.
Oh, you aren't going to talk to Bob Williams?
OK, you know what I'm going to do but you don't know what I'm going to say.
And neither do you.
That's the problem.
You don't think I can control my temper with Bob, do you?
Look Alan Matthews, Bob Williams.
Bob, Alan has something he'd like to say to you.
Bob has less hair.
Talk to the man.
Bob Bob.
Bob, I've got 150 people who are working very hard and being squeezed very tight by this rollback and my store is outperforming all the other Market Giants in the greater Philadelphia area and I feel that this rollback is neither warranted nor fair.
Calm, succinct, rational.
Gee, I'm just not attracted to you anymore.
Good night, sweetie.
Good night, Bob.
Good night, good-looking.
Now that I've got you alone Bob let me show you what I've always wanted to do with your head.
Now, my wife would call that cranky.
Hail, Corius.
Where's your spear?
I've got guys to carry my spear.
- Since when?
- Since you left the play and Feeny shifted all the roles around.
I got bumped up to Polonius.
You look more like a Balonius.
Yeah, he's kind of a fat guy and there's a lot of lines to memorize but you know what's really cool about him?
- What?
- Act lll, scene four.
Huh-aah!
Uhh!
Huh-uhh!
Huhh!
Huh!
What do you think?
You die pretty realistically.
Yeah.
Feeny says it's his favorite part of the play.
Yeah, so you're really getting into it.
How's Minkus doing in my part?
Good.
Good.
Really stinking bad.
He's killing us, Cory.
You got to come back.
Hey, if Feeny backs down on the ballerina outfit, I'm there.
He's not going to back down and Minkus is stinking up my play.
Well, I'm not crawling back to Feeny.
Cory, I'm asking you a favor.
Shawn, yesterday you worshipped me as a god for quitting.
If the play's so bad, then why don't you quit?
I can't.
Too many people are depending on me.
Who's depending on you?
My dad.
He's coming to see the play.
Your dad's taking time off work to watch you die?
Apparently this is something everybody wants to see.
You know what I want to see?
You and me shooting hoops in the gym right now.
I can't, Cory.
I got rehearsal.
Hey, guys.
Wait up.
They disobey me like that again, I'm going to sit on them.
What is he whose grief bears such an emphasis?
Stop, Mr. Minkus.
I answer only to Hamlet.
Stop, Mr. Hamlet.
You're supposed to be facing the audience.
Aren't I?
Hamlet, where are your glasses?
Mr. Feeny, they didn't have eyeglasses in the Middle Ages.
Put on your glasses and climb into ophelia's grave.
You know, I read an article that Elizabethan English is a lot like American Southern so let me show you a little something I've been playing around With.
Shazam!
Show me what thou't do.
Woo't weep?
Woo't fight?
Woo't tear thyself?
Oh, great.
Ernest goes to Denmark.
Stuart, I can't breathe.
- Stick to the script.
- Your foot is on my liver.
I can't Work like this.
All right, all right, I've had enough of rehearsal.
I want you all to go home.
Hey, looks like we can shoot hoops after all.
Yeah, let me just go park my gut in the wardrobe room.
So, how's the play going?
Well, as you can see, very poorly.
You know, when I quit this thing I didn't think that everyone would be so affected.
Neither did I. OK, Mr. Feeny, I'm still not big on the pantyhose idea but if that's what it takes, you got your Hamlet back.
Mr. Matthews, come here.
I already have my Hamlet.
He may bump into the scenery, he may talk like a hayseed For all I know, tomorrow he may show up in kabuki makeup.
Nevertheless, he is my Hamlet.
I do, however, have an opening for a spear carrier.
Spear carrier?
There's an old theater expression there are no small parts, only small actors.
You know, Mr. Feeny maybe I wouldn't have bailed on this play if you picked something a little cooler.
I mean, couldn't we do selected scenes from The Terminator?
Or how about a Steven Seagal soliloquy?
You know, Mr. Matthews, you are absolutely right.
Shakespeare is dry, tedious and there's no way for a person your age to be affected by it.
I am thy father's spirit doomed for a certain term to waLk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burned and purged away.
But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young bLood but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood.
List!
List!
Oh.
List.
If thou didst ever thy dear father love oh, God.
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
Murder?
Of course, I'm no Steven Seagal.
Dad!
oh, it's just you.
Mom, you wasted a perfectly good birth on this?
Dad's supposed to be home from his meeting by now.
What meeting?
Your dad went down to talk to the regional manager about that salary rollback.
What?
Why did he do that?
Mom, he could lose his job.
They could bust him down to box boy.
I thought you wanted him to talk to his boss.
Oh, way to go, Cory.
If Dad gets fired, they're never going to keep me on.
You've destroyed the whole family.
I got to go down to the store and stop him.
Dad!
You didn't yell at your boss, did you?
Why would anyone think I was going to yell?
Hey, I'm the one who found Bob Williams' head splattered all over the kitchen floor.
- Did you get my 5% back?
- No, Eric.
I didn't.
I'm going to cancel Yeah, but, you know, I had a very good talk with Bob Williams, and Bob is very clear on my point I'm talking to nobody.
So, how did it go?
It was not the easiest meeting I've ever had.
Dad, you didn't quit, did you?
No, I didn't.
I was tempted, but I didn't.
I guess you couldn't, huh?
I mean, with me and Mom and the rest of the family counting on you.
No.
I didn't want to let you guys down.
Wish I'd figured that out a couple days ago.
I did let all my guys down.
You mean when you quit your play?
Yeah.
You know, being the lead in the play is a lot like being the dad.
Excuse me?
OK, so it's not, but still if you make a selfish mistake the people who count on you get hurt.
Well, maybe Mr. Feeny would let you back in the play.
Well, he did offer me a smaller part.
The bad news is I'd still have to Wear the pantyhose.
But nobody laughs at a guy carrying a big spear.
Oh, good!
Daddy's here!
We can start!
- Not yet, Morgan.
- Start what?
Oh, you know women.
They're always starting something.
Dad, I'm sorry I got on your case about you not being able to take us to the Jersey shore.
You know, between us, I've never even liked Goofy Golf.
Oh, well, you could've fooled me.
You always looked like you were having a lot of fun.
No, no.
If I never see another Goofy Golf ball again it's fine With me.
Oh, well, you'll be really disappointed when you see what's in the backyard.
What?
Whoa!
Goofy Golf!
Did I mention how much I love Goofy Golf?
Well, it's not exactly the Jersey shore.
No, it's better.
We don't have to drive three hours with Morgan getting carsick and Mom singing show tunes.
Sometimes I think that's why Morgan gets carsick.
Well, come on, let's play.
Listen, listen, listen, if you want to make a hole in one in the Market Giant here, aim for the right armpit.
No, that'll bank into Feeny's backyard.
Not if somebody designed an imperceptible little groove that guides the ball into the cup.
Dad!
Let's just keep this between us winners.
- Three!
- Uh, fore.
Whatever.
Are you ready to pound these weenies into the ground for the seventh straight year?
No mercy.
Unless you guys want to give up now.
Do you want to quit?
Oh, that's never been my style.
How about you?
I quit quitting.
Hey, my partner and I are not quitters.
Cheaters, yes.
Quitters, no.
Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew.
This bites.
If I was any more bored, I'd be dead.
What are you talking about?
Without us, there'd be no play.
We're the few, the proud, the spear carriers.
Give me a break.
No one even knows we're here.
Might as well be that wall over there.
Have some pride, man.
Live your part.
Make it your own.
OK.
Oh, I thinks ooh!
Ah!
Shakespeare as it was meant to be.
Grrr.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hormones the telegraph system of the body.
Sometime between the ages of nine and sixteen they wiLL start to teLL your body to change very fast.
This movie's rated "H" for hurl.
Mr. Matthews, calm down and watch the film.
The changes won't aLL be physical.
Sometimes you'll feeL Like you're on an emotional roller coaster.
For instance you may occasionally feeL aggressive or weepy.
Shawn, I'm feeling so vulnerable.
Do you have a tissue?
Shh!
And remember.
girLs.
you'll get your hormonal telegram weLL ahead of your boy classmates.
telegram for Miss Teenager.
GirLs.
be patient whiLe they catch up to you.
Eventually.
everyone hears the Morse code of puberty.
I got your Morse code right here.
This film is meant to help you understand the metamorphosis your bodies will soon be going through.
How?
That movie's a hundred years old.
The telegram boy was played by George Burns.
I welcome the changes that will transform me from a caterpillar into a butterfly.
You say a butterfly.
I say a hairball with wings.
- Hah!
- Hah!
That's a beautiful outlook, Miss Lawrence.
Beautiful?
I've seen hormones turn a normal guy's face into craters 'r' us.
Yes, there will be side effects, but those, thank goodness will be the province of your seventh-grade teacher.
- If it happens.
- oh, it will happen.
Maybe, maybe not.
I mean, I'm young, and I'm fast.
I can dodge hormones for days years if I have to.
I'm going to stay twelve tiLL I'm forty-two.
And Shawn's in with me on this the whoLe way.
Right.
Shawn?
Shawn?
Shawn?
Tell me something.
How do you ask a girl out?
Simple.
You open the door and say, "Get out.
You're bothering me.
" No, I mean, like, on a date.
Well, Eric uses the shotgun approach.
He just keeps dialing random numbers till he hears the word "yes.
" Sounds like a lot of work.
Yeah, and after all that, what do you got?
A girl.
What's the point?
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing your pathetic conversation.
Perhaps you two neophytes would like some coaching from a seasoned veteran.
OK, Minkus, let's pretend for just a minute that I'm actually interested in what you've got to say.
Well, girls are soft, caring, gentle creatures of nature yet so complex and mysterious.
Minkus, get a cat.
Here.
My research material.
- Perky magazine?
- Perky tells girls everything they want to know about themselves.
Therefore, if we read it we'll know everything about them, too.
It's the road map to their very souls.
"Shaving your legs how high is high enough"?
Your little friend there hasn't gotten his telegram yet.
"Mascara use it, don't abuse it.
" Well, um, as long as I don't actually have to go to the newsstand and buy it I might as well borrow it for a couple days.
"Guys with one eyebrow what's their problem"?
You know, this is the encyclopedia to everything you don't want to know.
Yeah.
Can you imagine reading this kind of garbage?
I know.
Every morning when I look for a magazine to hide in my math book, I think Sports illustrated?
Road and Track?
Or, wait, how about the lip gloss issue of Perky?
Hi, Shawn.
Huh-huh-huh-huh.
Would you like to go to the movies with me?
Huh-huh-huh-huh.
Great.
We can meet at my locker after school and my mom will drop us off at the mall.
See ya later, terminator.
Hee hee hee hee hee.
Hee hee hee.
Did she just tell a joke I didn't get?
Hee hee hee hee hee.
- Shawn, stop laughing.
- I can't.
Whoa.
I don't even know what just happened.
I'm feeling really weird, Cory.
Heh heh heh heh heh.
You look really weird.
Shawn, what's happening?
I don't know.
Ha ha ha.
You're scaring me.
Shawn, talk to me.
I can't talk about it.
I can laugh about it, but I cannot talk about it.
OK, so we're in front of the movie theater.
First hurdle did she pay, or did you pay?
Eric, we snuck in.
She agreed to a criminal act.
I like this girl.
Then I go to get the popcorn, right?
All right.
Very important did she offer to pay?
We split it right down the middle.
She's a keeper.
Of course, I sprung for the artificial buttery-flavored topping.
Nice touch.
You know, I could really make you into something.
What are you guys doing?
Uh, do you mind?
We're talking here.
Well, you can't be talking to Shawn 'cause Shawn told me he can't talk to anybody.
Did you forget about our basketball game?
Sorry, Cory, I guess I lost track of the time.
Hang on a minute, Cory.
This is guy stuff, oK?
Basketball is guy stuff.
Ha ha!
They're so cute at this age.
All right, so you and Hilary are sitting in the movie theater.
- What'd you go see?
- Like we watched the movie.
Don't tell me you Yes.
We threw malt balls at people's heads for two hours.
Well, not the way I would've gone but, hey, you're still playing in the minors.
You know, Shawn, there's probably another solid hour of basketball light out there.
Come on.
Let's go.
You know who I'm sitting in the car with?
Nobody.
Morgan, can't we do this next week?
No.
Mother's Day is Sunday, and I need a present.
That's right.
I need to get one, too.
I've been racking my brain real hard for a special gift for Mom.
OK, what do you want me to pick up?
Oh, whatever's laying around.
Move it, mall boy.
Let's go shoot some hoops.
Wouldn't you rather play a little one-on-one with Hilary?
Come on, Cor.
Let's just go play.
No.
You made it perfectly clear.
She throws malt balls as well as I do.
You know what?
If you hold the malt ball in your mouth for a minute right before you throw it it really sticks in people's hair.
- Did Hilary teach you that?
- Yeah.
She's majorly twisted.
Oh, and suddenly I'm not?
Cory, what's the big deal?
It's always been you and me.
It's you and me now and it's going to be you and me forever.
Nothing has changed.
I'm going to go sit with Hilary.
Oh, yeah.
Nothing's changed.
All right, Shawn wants to be with a girl?
TWo can play at that game.
First stop research.
Minkus, let's talk Perky.
Ah, your telegram has finally arrived.
No, this isn't romance.
It's revenge.
TWo sides of the same hormone.
All right, bottom line what does that magazine say you've got to do to get a girl to go out with you?
Me?
Almost nothing.
But you, it's going to take some effort.
And you wonder why you sit alone at lunch.
Here's your first dating tip.
Don't insult the boy with the Perkys.
I'm sorry.
All right, so what do I have to do?
According to the survey in the September issue what do you think is the number one thing girls want from a guy?
Uh, loose change?
That's number nine.
The number one thing is shared interest.
And that means Cory, this isn't algebra.
This is something you can conceivably understand.
Shared interests.
Talk to me.
If she's into something, show an interest in it.
Example if the girl you're dating is interested in numismatics, you talk about Numizmos?
Coins.
All right, give me number two on that list just in case I can't fake an interest in something.
- Sense of humor.
- No problem.
I'm a regular laugh riot.
All right, so how do I select a lucky girl?
Well, just think of someone you're completely comfortable with someone you could share a meal with and someone who doesn't mind having you around.
Well, my mom's already taken.
Cory, just go for the first thing in a dress.
A dress.
A dress.
A dress.
A dress.
- Topanga.
- Yes, Cory?
So, what's interesting in your life right now?
Well, Mercury is in retrograde making projects difficult to complete and causing general chaos in the universe.
You know, not only is that unbelievably interesting it reminds me of a joke I once heard.
How did the astrologer cross the road?
- I don't know.
- In his Taurus.
But I kid the zodiac.
Um, would you like to go to Bob Stubcheck's Burger World after school?
Cory, I'm a vegetarian.
Of course you are.
That's why we're just going to meet at Burger World and walk over to international House of Salads.
I love IHOS.
Who doesn't?
OK.
Gee, I wonder what the sprout of the day is.
Who cares?
You can't go wrong with a nice bowl of spaghetti and sprout balls.
So, I'll just meet you at 4:30.
OK, it's a date.
A date?
Who said anything about a date?
What have I done?
OK.
What do you know that I don't know?
Nothing.
- Which kid is it?
- Cory.
Oh, I knew it.
oK, oK.
Let's see.
He's too old to steal candy, but too young to wreck a car.
Oh, no.
It's a girl.
It is.
Cory is going on his first date.
Isn't that sweet?
Yeah.
Poor slob.
What are you saying?
You're his father.
You should be proud.
Hey, I've been on the guy side of dating.
I mean, he's fine now, but he's just a little step away from huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
Dating was always fun for me.
I remember talking on the phone to eight different guys a night.
Yeah, well, the only way I survived it was knowing that one day I'd be married and I'd be calling the shots.
Honey, I'm so sorry things didn't work out for you.
I Wonder if I can still Warn him about the minefield he's about to step into without ruining his life.
Well, Cory doesn't appear to be suffering like you did.
He's actually excited about this date.
I overheard him telling Shawn that he couldn't play basketball today because he was going out with Topanga.
Topanga?
Cory's always teasing, making fun of her.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Cory, I think this is so wonderful.
Son, this is the stupidest thing you've ever done.
Before I shoot myself in the foot which stupid thing are we talking about?
- Your date with Topanga.
- What were you thinking?
Everything started getting all fuzzy after that telegram movie.
Not the hormonal telegram.
Are they still showing that film?
I cried during that movie.
If it wasn't for that movie, I'd still be twelve.
Yeah, it had a weird effect on a lot of people.
But ever since We saw it people are doing really strange things.
Well, you certainly are.
You've never asked a girl out before.
Yeah, well, neither did Shawn.
Did you ask Topanga out so you could keep up with him?
Whoa.
That's weird.
How did she know?
It's the sorority of Satan.
Well, Cor, as much as I wanted to see you go out on your first little date I don't think it's fair to Topanga.
As much as I wanted to see it, too I I think your mother's right.
You should cancel now.
Mom, Dad, you're right.
With women, honesty is the best policy.
And he thinks he's ready to date.
Hi.
Is Topanga there?
Yeah, I did mean physically.
Hi, Topanga.
It's me Cory Matthews.
You probably remember me from school.
Yeah.
Well, listen, when I made this date I didn't know it at that time, but now I just found out.
Topanga, I got to be totally honest with you.
I got the flu, and I can't go out.
I feel fine about that.
Fall-away jumper at the buzzer.
Good if it goes.
Three-pointer!
Yes!
Sixers win!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Whoo.
Hi, Cory.
How are you feeling?
Uh, clammy.
Very fluish.
Yeah.
It's very contagious.
You better get out of here.
Here.
Drink this.
It'll detoxify your aura.
- What is it?
- It's called bancha tea.
Smells like a bancha gym socks.
Cory, it's a remedy that's been used for centuries.
"Best if used before Lincoln's assassination.
" I just wanted to help you feel better.
I'm sorry if I bothered you.
Wait, Topanga.
Thanks for bringing the tea, but I don't need to drink it 'cause I'm not technically sick.
Then why did you say you were?
Well, I guess because I didn't know how to tell you.
I'm not ready to go out on a date yet.
That's oK.
Jedidiah and Chloe have always told me "Listen to your inner voice.
It'll let you know what is true for you.
" Yeah.
My parents said that, too.
only they said it without all the planets circling around their heads.
So I'll see you at school?
Yeah, unless Feeny moves my seat.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I better be going.
And I guess I'll be staying here.
May I ask you a personal question?
Sure.
Why are there socks all over your floor?
Oh.
I was just practicing.
I envy your athletic ability.
Oh, this?
It's not so hard.
Come on, I'll give you some pointers.
All right.
First, you grab some ammo.
Ninja turtles?
And now they're gone.
Um, anyway, the key is good color commentary.
If you can live up to your own hype, you got it made.
Watch this.
Matthews sees an open lane.
He drives hard to the boards.
He leaps over Shaquille o'Neal, kisses it off the glass!
It's good!
He scores!
I could never do that.
Sure you can.
Give it a try.
But I'm not familiar with the terminology.
All right, I'll do the color.
You just worry about getting the ball in the basket.
Topanga's triple-teamed at the time line.
She breaks the trap, heads to the top of the key and leaps toward the basket, doing a spiraling tomahawk 360!
Slam dunk!
Look.
We both made a basket.
Technically, yeah, but, uh basketball's so much more fun when you actually move.
All right, you try and make another basket and I'll try and block you.
Way to go, Topanga.
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
Huh-huh-huh-huh.
It's nice that you help your father with the laundry.
Yeah, well, we're a fairly cutting-edge family so, uh, my mom does most of the laundry.
I'm just helping out because Mother's Day is coming up.
So you're doing chores for your Mother's Day gift?
You think I could get away with that?
What are you getting your mom?
I could use some ideas.
At our house, we don't celebrate Mother's Day.
We feel it's merely a commercial fabrication of the greeting card industry.
She has, however, asked for a dust buster.
My mom's pretty well set for small appliances and my funds are sort of limited.
You don't need money.
You just need to use your right brain.
Wow.
All these years I've been using the wrong one.
So what do you think I should get my mom?
You can never go wrong with something from the heart.
Right or left heart?
You're killing me, Cory.
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh.
- Hey, guys.
- There he is young me.
How was your second date?
- You had another date?
- Yeah.
My last one.
Ah, second-date slump.
I've seen it happen a thousand times.
Not to me.
You know, you know, I'm thinking it's deeper than that.
See, each one of us is born with a certain amount of coolness.
A guy like Minkus could live to be a thousand years old and never use a drop of his cool.
Me I'm a thirteen-year-old burnout.
Shawn, get a grip.
You're still cool.
It's just the planet Mercury in retrospect.
What are you babbling about?
Some astrology thing.
Topanga was explaining it to me.
Hey, that's right.
How was your date?
What date?
I didn't have a date.
I canceled it.
Oh, come on, Cor.
When I got home from work you and Topanga were looking pretty cozy on the couch there.
That Was not a date.
She just came over to bring me some aura juice.
And?
And nothing.
I taught her how to shoot a basket.
OK, so let's recap.
Point "A," she brought refreshments.
Point "B," you chose the activity.
Sounds like a date to me.
Read my lips there was no date.
We talked about what we were getting our moms for Mother's Day.
Aha.
Point "C," shared interests.
Sixteen to base.
We have a confirmed date.
Send backup.
Uh, Topanga?
You and I have to get something straight.
Yes, Cory?
Friday night when you came over to my house that was not a date.
I'm not into labels.
Yeah, but if you were what we had Friday night would not be labeled a date 'cause if you'll recall the circumstances of that evening I canceled What Would have been labeled a date.
That's fine, Cory.
It was not a date.
Well, I'll see you later.
OK.
Hey, Topanga?
You know, your idea about writing my mom a poem for Mother's Day really worked out great.
She cried.
Tears are the thank you notes of the soul.
You know a lot about women.
Well, I am going to grow up to be one.
Face it.
Minkus was right.
Don't you hate it when that happens?
No matter how you look at it there's going to be hormones, and there's going to be girls.
Important girls are going to come into our lives and stay for days at a time.
You know what's cool?
We made it through our first dates and we're still best friends.
And we're going to stay best friends through second dates, proms, engagements, marriages.
Second marriages.
Whatever comes along we're going to stand here and face it together shoulder to shoulder.
- Hi, Shawn.
- Hi, Cory.
- Later.
- Later.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
You got your milk.
You got your peanut butter.
How about a banana?
What about a raw egg?
Eww.
Why's it have to be raw?
Why can't we scramble it and put it in?
Stallone drinks raw eggs.
Stallone is like 5'2"!
And you're like 2'5"!
Go with the egg, baby.
Hey!
We're not going to make a mess.
Just because we're kids with a blender doesn't mean we have to make a mess.
Boy, are you Mommy whipped.
Aah!
Now, that I could never do at my house.
Oh, my mom!
Shawn, back me up.
I wanted to use the lid.
I was Lid Boy!
OK, fine.
I'll clean it up.
You don't have to scream.
Hey, watch it.
You're getting it all over my geography book.
Oh, like you're ever going to open it up.
Feeny's test tomorrow is going to be such a killer.
Yeah, I don't understand why we have to learn anything about geography.
Why do we have to learn where everything is?
I'll just be like my dad and drive around till I find it.
Look at Feeny.
He's out there hanging up some geeky duck.
Not a care in the World while we're stuck in here studying for his lame test.
Yeah.
Life's fair.
Well, we haven't actually done any studying yet.
Maybe we should get started.
OK.
Ahem.
What is the capital of North Dakota?
Banff.
We're toast.
Let's just say we're sick and stay home tomorrow.
I can't, Cor.
I've already used all my bogus medical excuses.
Feeny says if my grandma dies one more time he wants to see the body.
How come it has to be us?
Why should we always be the ones faking a disease to get out of school?
How come Feeny can't shoulder a little more responsibility?
Ah, dream on.
I hear he hasn't missed a day of school since World War I. That's just stupid on his part because teachers still get paid when they're sick.
You lie.
I swear!
Minkus said the school board pays them to be sick for a whole week every year.
Well, maybe Feeny doesn't know that.
Maybe we should leave him a unanimous note on his desk.
Won't help us dodge that geography bullet tomorrow.
Come on cough!
There's a look.
Don't tell me.
You've died and come back as a bat with a perm.
This Hindu yoga position increases blood flow to the brain thus maximizing concentration and cognitive performance.
It's also quite a rush.
I am so nervous.
You?
My palms are sweating so much I can't read the answers I Wrote on them.
I'm sensing an acute case of performance anxiety no doubt brought on by a complete lack of preparation.
Minkus, you can get all the As you want.
It still not gonna make you popular.
That's right.
I can just hear you "People, people, how many times do I have to tell you?
"If you save your receipts "you won't have to worry about an audit.
" And I can hear you ten years from now.
"Your Honor, dude "I'd like to plea bargain.
" - Geek master.
- Recidivist.
Good morning, class.
I'm Miss Chase, your substitute teacher.
Mr. Feeny will not be in today.
He has taken ill.
Taken ill or fakin' ill?
I mean, the guy's never missed a day.
Maybe he heard about the school board's great deal on sick leave.
I'm afraid I don't have access to Mr. Feeny's lesson plan.
Can somebody please fill me in on what you were going to do today?
Miss Chase, today we're supposed to take a geo Break.
A break from geography.
And do nothing but think about our lives and write a poem about it.
A short poem.
Two.
maybe three Lines.
tops.
And it doesn't even have to rhyme.
Is this true?
Yep.
Great.
My major at the University of Pennsylvania was poetry epic poetry.
In fact, my dissertation was on "Beowulf" an 8th Century poem written in 3,200 lines of old English.
Let's see if We can knock out the first 1,600 lines before lunch, shall we?
Aah!
I can't believe Mr. Feeny actually missed a day of school.
Well, you know who you can thank for that, don't you?
Zeus?
Me!
I wished for him to get sick, and he did.
You didn't wish for him to get sick.
Sure, I did, yesterday, when we weren't studying.
Even if you did, you can't make something happen just because you say it.
The power of the mind is not to be taken lightly, Shawn.
Force of will is the most powerful weapon on earth.
No.
No, it's not.
Maybe I do have some kind of strange power like the X-Men only I have the power to make people sick.
Yeah.
It's working on me right now.
Maybe I'll call myself Sick Boy!
Sick Boy, possessor of a strange mutant power can, with a glance of his sickening eye make otherwise healthy men bend over the toilet and go, "Huahh"!
All right, Sick Boy.
If you can do it, do it to him.
Piece of cake.
Hey, Minkus.
Minkus, come here.
When your mother cuts your hair tell her to take the oatmeal out of the bowl.
Sorry, Shawn, but I don't have the energy to trade insults today.
I'm not feeling very well.
- Whoa.
- Chills.
What can I say?
It's a gift.
Minkus, you were all right in class this morning.
When, exactly, did you start feeling terrible?
When I heard Mr. Feeny's in the hospital.
The hospital?
Sounds serious.
For Mr. Feeny and for you.
Why me?
Why's it serious for me?
Karma what goes around comes around.
The hospital?
Whoa, you are good.
Me?
I didn't do this.
You wished he would get sick.
I didn't wish for him to get sick.
Sure, you did, yesterday, when we weren't studying.
Shawn, you said it yourself.
Just because you want something to happen doesn't mean it's going to happen.
You're scary, Cor.
I wish you wouldn't say things like that.
Just don't look at me, oK?
Don't look at me!
"Free Bubba, Love, Arnie"?
"Feel better, Love, Amy.
" oh, that's what you think you wrote.
Cory, read this.
"Fried baloney, Love, Alvin.
" - Just sign it!
- What is it?
It's a get well card for Mr. Feeny.
Here, you sign it, too.
- I don't think so, Mom.
- Suit yourself.
I just wanted to get him out of the hospital faster.
How's a card going to do that?
It cheers him up.
Power of positive thinking.
Wait a minute.
Mom, Mom, Mom.
You're saying someone can get better just 'cause someone wishes they will?
Yeah.
Does the opposite of that work, too?
Can someone get sick just 'cause someone says they will?
Well, that is the principle behind voodoo curses.
But you'd have to go to, like, a voodoo academy to pull off something like that, wouldn't you?
I mean, your average couldn't go around making people drop like flies, could he?
No reason.
No interest.
My lips are just moving.
Words are coming out.
Eric.
we've got to taLk.
All right, I wished real hard for Feeny to get sick so I wouldn't have to take this geography test and he got sick.
- So?
- So, I did this to him.
I have the gift.
What gift?
I can make people sick.
Now, see, I've always known that, Cor.
Why do you think I sleep with a barf bag?
Eric, I'm serious.
Yeah, like you're the one who made Feeny's appendix blow.
He has appendicitis?
Yeah, he's getting operated on right now.
An operation.
That's bad.
Remember Fluffy, our cat?
He died during an operation.
Cory, Fluffy fell out of a tree.
They were trying to sew his head back on.
It was big odds going in.
Look, I know I did not cause Mr. Feeny to get sick but it would make me feel a heck of a lot better if you would just give me some sort of sign that he's gonna be all right.
Yesterday we were absolutely enthralled by the first 1.600 exciting Lines of "Beowulf.
" Can anyone recap for us?
Hrothgar, king of the Danes, on the island of Zealand has built the mead hall Heorot for feasting his warriors but they abandon it because of the murderous ravages of the monster Grendel.
Is it just me, or does anyone else want to absolutely hurl from boredom?
Do you have a problem with "Beowulf"?
Yeah.
My problem is nobody cares.
I don't need this.
When am I going to need this?
No one has ever needed this.
And let me make myself even clearer.
"Beowulf" needed?
No!
And on a completely side issue who names their baby Hrothgar?
Are you through?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm not.
I don't think we need geography, either.
This is a school.
What we should do here?
I think we should sit around, talk about whatever we want and you should make us cupcakes.
Cory Matthews, you are so right.
Shawn, Shawn, wake up!
I fixed everything.
Thank you for stopping me from wasting my entire life.
I mean, I would have ended up just like Mr. Feeny who believes in geography and mathematics and that other garbage you'll never need.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is a teacher!
Here.
Why don't you pass these out to everybody?
When did you bake these?
Just this second.
I most heartily object to this flagrant desecration of the temple of knowledge.
Stuff it, nerd boy.
Mr. Matthews, who's the new teacher?
Karen.
Karen?
Yeah.
We're on a first name basis.
Cozy.
And we're not taking that geography test, either.
In fact, we've done away with geography.
No one needs it.
You must think you've died and gone to heaven.
Yep.
No offense, but you could learn a lot about teaching from Karen.
Well, I guess I've been an ogre all these years, hmm?
What was I thinking?
Nobody knows.
But all that stress you put on us probably just bounced back and made you sick.
Karma what goes around goes around and around.
You need to lighten up.
Well, thank you for the advice, Mr. Matthews.
Uh like this?
Cut it out, Cory.
That wasn't me.
That was Mr. Feeny.
Mr. Feeny?
Talk about a sick joke.
What do you mean?
He's standing right here.
Oh, nurse!
He can't see me, Mr. Matthews.
Why not?
Because he's not the one responsible.
Responsible for What?
For killing me.
I died in the hospital.
What?
I'm dead, Mr. Matthews thanks to you.
Don't die, Mr. Feeny!
I didn't mean to kill you!
Oh, man.
Eric, I just dreamed I killed Mr. Feeny and he came back to haunt me.
It Was terrible.
Eric?
Aah!
What are you doing here?
I'm memorizing the dictionary, Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Feeny, I just woke up.
You can't be here anymore.
I can be anywhere I want.
I'm dead.
You're not dead.
You can't be dead.
I only wanted you to have the sniffles.
It started With the sniffles.
Cor, you look terrible.
Coffee?
What are you doing with coffee?
I always drink coffee after I kill a man.
Mr. Feeny's in the hospital because of a bad appendix.
No matter what you wished, you had nothing to do with it.
But how come I can't get him out of my mind?
Why am I seeing him everywhere?
Because you feel guilty.
Because I wished he'd get sick.
Yeah, why'd you do that?
So I wouldn't have to take his stupid geography test about stuff I'd never need.
Yeah, I know how you feel.
I had a teacher in fourth grade Miss Perch.
Now, the name Perch implies that she was a lot better-looking than she actually was.
And this relates to me how?
You know why I'm the manager down at the supermarket?
Because when I started out as a box boy I could add long columns of numbers in my head faster than the cashiers could at the machines.
I always told everyone it was a natural gift but the fact is, I knew it was a gift from Miss Perch.
So, why did you feel guilty?
Well, when she was trying to teach me math I Was the kid in the back of the room always going, "I'm never gonna need this.
" By the time I figured out why I needed it it was too late to say thank you.
So you're saying Feeny's teaching us stuff now that we're gonna need when we're older.
And instead of saying thank you, I wished for him to get sick.
Is that why I'm having nightmares?
Your nightmares are just a manifestation of your guilt.
You created them.
You can control them.
What's for breakfast.
Mr. Matthews?
Down here.
How you doing?
You don't scare me anymore, Mr. Feeny.
You're not real.
You're just a manifestation of my guilt.
Ooh.
"Manifestation.
" Big word for someone who can barely spell "cat.
" I created him.
I can make him go away.
Whew.
Knock knock.
Mr. Matthews.
What a surprise.
Where are your parents?
They didn't bring me.
I took the bus.
Actually, they don't even know I'm here.
I brought you a germanium.
Geranium.
Didn't I say germanium?
Yes, you did.
In fact, germanium is a chemical element.
Atomic weight 72.59.
It's used as a semiconductor.
Your brain must weigh so much.
A geranium is a lovely plant.
In California, they can grow to the size of a bush.
So this is a hospital, huh?
Oh.
Is this your grandson?
- No.
- No way.
- Not at all.
- What he said.
This is one of my students Cory Matthews.
Cory, this is Nurse Jill.
Well, it's nice to see one of your students came to visit you, George.
She calls you by your first name?
Don't blow it for me, you little weasel.
I stashed two bottles of that pineapple juice you like in case you and your nongrandson want to have one.
I am eternally grateful.
Cory, you stay as long as you like.
And if a big dragon in a hat that says "Head Nurse" tries to kick you out you tell her you're a friend of Jill's, oK?
OK.
See you later, George.
She seems nice.
Yes, indeed.
Very nice.
Did we just have, like, a guy moment?
Yes, I suppose we did.
Why are you here, Mr. Matthews?
I mean, a hospital is a very scary place.
I guess I wanted to see with my own eyes that you're oK.
Thank you for your good thoughts.
And that you're not dead.
Oh, I can't die, Mr. Matthews.
I have too much Work left undone too many students left untaught.
- Like me?
- Especially you.
In a strange way, you've kept me alive.
I'm glad.
Because there still might be some stuff you're going to teach me that I'm gonna need someday.
Like What?
Like, say I'm walking down the street and some guy comes up to me and says "What's the atomic weight of geranium"?
Thanks to you, I'll be able to say "That's a plant, you idiot.
" Dragon alert.
Lay low.
Maybe I'd better go so I don't get Nurse Jill in trouble.
Thank you very much for coming, Mr. Matthews.
You've made me feel much better.
I feel better, too.
Mr. Feeny Thank you.
For What?
I don't know yet.
Hey, Cor, what are you doing?
I'm trying to fix Mr. Feeny's dumb duck.
He's coming home tomorrow.
That's nice.
Looks like it could use some bracing.
Bracing, right.
Can I borrow your tools?
Sure.
Good morning, Mr. Matthews.
Mr. Feeny, you're home early.
Well, I got most of my strength back.
Besides, they replaced Nurse Jill with Nurse Larry.
I figured it was time to leave.
I'm trying to fix your duck.
Yes, so I see.
Thank you.
Why don't you take a break and help me plant this?
You're putting my puny plant in the ground?
Your plant, though immature and undeveloped has within it the potential to grow and flower with the help of a proper gardener.
You think so?
Oh, yes, as long as no one wishes it ill.
IfWe think it can happen, it Will happen.
You're saying we can light that light bulb without any electricity?
The greatest power company of all is the human mind.
Apparently Shawn didn't pay his bill.
Those are cute last Words.
Shh.
Let's focus our psychic energies on lighting the bulb.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Quiet.
None of the electricity made it to the bulb, Topanga.
It all got stuck in your hair.
There's your problem.
No one here is taking this seriously.
They don't care about your experiment, Topanga.
The only way to demonstrate the power of their selfish minds is to have them concentrate on something they really want to see happen.
Cool!
What?
The bulb didn't light.
