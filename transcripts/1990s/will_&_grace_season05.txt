{START OF EPISODE 1}
- Hi, Grace.
- Hi, Jack.
- Going to my audition.
- Going to make a baby.
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you too.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you all right ?
I feel like I was just hit by a bus.
Did you see the guy who attacked me ?
He was about 12'5", 500 pounds.
Big bulb on the top of his head.
This is crazy.
Who is late for their own insemination ?
Hi, it's Will.
Is Grace there by any chance ?
Well, if she shows up, would you call me ?
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Is that her office ?
No, Benny's Taco on East 74th.
Where the hell is she ?
I'm really getting worried here.
Hey, uh is this sexy ?
It's a little sexy.
But m-more disturbing.
You see, I told you this was faster.
You wanted to take the cross-town cow.
How do you have a horse in Manhattan ?
I rented him in the park, you know.
Some weeks we ride; some weeks we just get a pretzel.
Ooh, ooh, we're here.
Pull over.
Parking spot.
Score !
Just slide on down.
I'll catch you.
I gotcha.
Wow, you know, some people can't do that gracefully.
Thank you.
I'm Leo Markus, by the way.
Grace Adler.
Maybe I can take you out sometime, you know.
By you dinner, or You're asking me out ?
Oh.
You're laughin' in my face.
That's Yeah.
No, it's good.
Guys like that.
No, no.
I'm not laughing at you.
It's, um, see, I'm about to Uh, ooh, this is just ironical.
- So dinner ?
- No.
- Uh, look, Mr. Markus - Dr. Markus.
- Uh, Dr. Mark Doctor ?
- Yeah, I know.
It's pretty boring.
I'm just your nice, average, Jewish doctor.
Look, I really, really have to Jewish ?
I-I gotta go before I find out you come from money.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 1 And The Horse He Rode In On sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey.
Jack, what are you doing ?
I thought you had an audition.
The part didn't speak to me.
So, what, it just gave you the finger ?
And, uh, opt to ignore, okay ?
Anyway, I was thinking about this whole baby thing, and, um, I decided you should have a baby with Kelly Ripa.
Why ?
'Cause she's Kelly.
And she's Ripa.
She's Kelly Ripa.
I know, I know, I know.
I'm crazy late.
- I had an accident.
- What happened ?
And it better not be something stupid, like when you missed my 35th birthday because you ran into a mailbox.
I ran into a lamppost.
- Grace !
- I did !
I did.
Look !
A doctor on a horse came up and took me to the drugstore to get an icepack.
I'm not making this up.
I hurt my head.
Your head ?
Like you keep anything in there.
Good afternoon.
Do we have the sperm ?
You're gonna have to give me a little more notice than that.
Why don't you put on this gown, and we'll get started.
Hey, it's not a map of space.
It's a gown.
Come on, open it !
Stop stressing me !
Or our kid'll end up spending eight hours a day chasing his tail.
Well, as long as he or she can tell the difference between a lamppost and empty space.
Where's the doctor ?
Ahh, Miss Beaverhousen.
That delicious scent I knew it either had to be you or a thousand wild gardenias nestled in a mossy bank of money.
Save it, Lionel.
You're just smellin' the cheese dip in your Vandyke.
Perhaps we should take a dirty bath together.
Take it easy, sleazy.
I only came here to give you your key back.
I am a married woman.
Sure, my husband is an enormous bulldozer of a man who has to be hit with a stun gun before he can be weighed or medicated.
But when I said "I do" to Stan Walker and his attorneys I meant that to be forever.
I admire your integrity.
Would you care to step inside, take your clothes off, and discuss it further ?
I would indeed !
Not bad.
But better !
Oh, thank God.
I thought I was gonna have to breast-feed the baby.
I was just playin'.
I like what I got.
Why are you up ?
The doctors said the best chance of getting pregnant was being flat on your back with your legs in the air.
So come on, pretend somebody just paid for dinner.
- That's offensive.
- Pretend it was lobster.
Got you a couple of presents.
Twizzlers and - A dictionary ?
- Yeah.
I don't want our kid to say "ironical".
Come on, Will.
Put your lips on, fix your wig, 'cause we are going to the new club called the Gay Gay Gay Gay Gay Club.
Aw, that sounds fun.
Will you take me sometime ?
Grace, please, it's not that gay.
Let's go.
You don't move.
Ahh, great.
Knock me up and run.
Somewhere my old gym teacher is saying "I told you so".
Well, sweetie, it's been this way for generations.
Moms stay home.
Dads go out and cruise guys.
Or as my dad used to call it "bowling".
He even got a trophy for it.
How sick is that ?
Well, have fun.
Bring me back a souvenir Ew.
Don't.
Maybe I shouldn't go.
Come on, Will.
I'm all set.
Even got my surprise underwear on.
- You mean no underwear ?
- That's the surprise.
No, I This this is our baby.
It should be a priority.
Besides, it'd feel weird, you lying here, me being out there, giving guys the old "Hey, lookin' fine in your Calvin Kleins".
You don't wink, do you ?
Tell me you don't wink.
He winks.
You know what, no.
It just It doesn't feel right.
I'm I'm gonna take a break from all of it.
Yup, I am taking myself off the market, just for a little while.
Wow.
If you're going to do that, maybe I should too.
- So we're not dating ?
- I think we're not.
- Deal ?
- Deal.
Very similar to the deal the rest of the world made not to date you.
Hi, kids.
Just came by to say hello.
Heh.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's peachy.
Hey, Karen, you seem down.
Looks like you could use a shoulder to drink on.
Thanks for carin', Chuck.
Earlier tonight, Lionel Banks invited me to his hotel room.
Heh, well, at first I didn't want to go because, well, I'm a lady, and I do have moral standards to uphold.
I know !
That was just for us.
Anyway so I got to his room; we started talking.
Had a couple of minibars.
And, uh, next thing I knew he's touching me.
I couldn't stop him.
I didn't want to !
After years of being with Stan, I felt like "finally a man who knows how to make a woman feel like a girl, and how to make that girl feel like a slut, and how to make that slut feel like a woman".
- Did you do it ?
- We did everything but.
- Well, well, Mrs. Walker.
- Ooh.
Now, that's interesting.
Wait a minute.
Everything but "B-U-T", or everything butt "B-U-T-T" ?
- Everything but B-U-T.
- Oh, well, anybody can do that.
But now I don't know what to do.
I wanna see him again, but I don't know, should I ?
Well, on one hand, Stan did give you permission to sleep with other men while he was in prison.
Yeah, but on the other hand, he is your husband; you did take a vow to stay faithful to him.
What are you going to do, Karen ?
The only thing I can do I'm gonna tell Mr. Banks to take a hike, and I'm gonna wait for my man to get sprung because, let's face it, Stanley Walker may not be a handsome man and he may not be a charming man That's it.
What a rook, only five blueberries.
$3.50 for a muffin ?
You'd think they'd give ya more than Hold on a second.
This side is lousy with blueberries.
Grace Adler, what are you doing here ?
You didn't hit your head on that coffee urn, did you ?
Leo, hi, what are you doing here ?
It's fate.
Once in a lifetime, the stars line up to bring two people together.
That and my office is right there.
- What are you doing now ?
- I'm joining you.
- For what ?
- Small talk you know, a little back-and-forth.
I just went and now you go.
- Leo - Is it my turn already ?
You know, heart pumps are tricky.
Your turn.
Okay, I get it.
You're fun.
But I'm I'm just not dating.
I've got a lot a lot on my plate right now, a lot I need to focus on.
Okay, I get it.
No date.
Well, at least let me have a look at your gash.
- That is the rudest thing - On your head.
From the lamppost.
I knew.
- Easy, easy.
Come on.
- Calm down, hold still.
- How's it look ?
- It looks good.
It looks very good.
Okay, Dr. Feelgood.
Time to go operate on someone else.
Let me let me just give you something to help it heal then.
It's a topical cream.
Just put a little bit on two or three times a day.
That's all.
"Have dinner with me tonight".
Gee, tonight, I don't know, I-I-I I have a lot on my plate right now, a lot I need to focus on, so Good-bye.
I'm coming out.
Buh-pow !
I want the world to know.
I got to let it show.
I'm coming out Ooh, I am coming out !
Ooh.
Okay, patience, girls.
Save it for Lionel.
Don't do it !
Hoo !
Honey I knew when you said you weren't gonna sleep with Lionel that you would because that's what I would have done.
Sex is a drug, Karen.
I should know.
I'm a licensed dealer.
I hate that you know me so well.
But who are you to judge, Judy ?
I need the touch of a strong man.
And it's not enough anymore having Rosario wrestle me into my robe every morning.
- You have to go.
Come on.
- But it's wrong.
What are you talking wrong ?
You're the one who told me monogamy was for lesbians.
And I still believe that, girl.
But I was on stage in acting class, and I had a lot of time to think, you know, during my scene partner's lines, and it came to me.
Maybe cheating isn't good for a marriage.
I know, honey.
But I'm not the one who messed it up.
Stanley did, when he landed himself in jail for an extra year and a half.
I know you still love him, Kar.
And I love you and your money.
I don't want to see either one get hurt.
Oh, poodle.
Mmm.
You don't have to worry about me.
I know who I'm doin'.
Oh, I'm I'm sorry.
I was looking for Grace Adler.
- I thought that she - No, you're right.
She lives here.
Oh, okay, um, she left her wallet in the coffee shop.
Ah, thanks.
She'll be glad to have that back.
It's got her frequent frozen yogurt card in it.
Just tell her Leo dropped it off.
Thanks.
Does she know you ?
Well, we met in the coffee shop today, and a couple days ago I helped her when she ran into a lamppost.
Oh, wait, you're the doctor from the park.
Right.
You're that That horse guy.
Jeez, you ride a horse one time, and all of a sudden you're "that horse guy".
And you're what, her her, uh housekeeper ?
Who am I ?
Well, let's see, I'm the one that's been in her life for 15 years, I'm the one she lives with.
I'm the one she's having a child with.
So you wanna stick around and ask her out to a movie or are you pretty much set, horse guy ?
I'm pretty much set.
I was in there two minutes, and I read an entire Us magazine.
Leo dropped this off.
Oh !
Thank God.
It's got my frequent frozen yogurt card in it.
- What, aren't you happy for me ?
- Who the hell is Leo, - and how long he you been seeing him ?
- What ?
We aren't seeing each other.
He he just fixed my head when I ran into a lamppost, and then I ran into him at a coffee shop.
Oh, you just keep running into things, don't you ?
Why don't you run into a wedding chapel, get married, and have a baby with him ?
- What the hell's wrong with you ?
- What's wrong with me ?
You broke our pact.
- What pack ?
- Not pack, pact.
- That's what I said, "pack".
- No, P-A-C - Let's take a different tack.
- You mean tact.
No, tack !
Tack, pact !
One ends with a "K".
One ends with a "T".
I know, it's ironical !
Look it up in the freakin' dictionary !
I didn't break any p agreement.
All I did was have coffee with him.
And I didn't even have coffee with him !
I mean, if that's not holding up my end of the pa agreement, - I don't know what is !
- Don't give me that.
I saw that look in Leo's eyes, those big beautiful eyes, and that hair that probably doesn't even need product !
I bet he jumps outta the shower in the morning and does this - Are you jealous ?
- No, I am not jealous.
- It's just I-I-I-I-I-I - What ?
- When you When you - What ?
I- I-I-I I kissed a guy, okay ?
At that club the other night, the Gay Gay Gay Gay Gay club.
I did go, and I met this guy a hot hot hot hot hot guy.
And I know we said we were taking ourselves off the market, but then this, this Pink song came on, and his shirt came off.
And I thought "I've got two choices here.
I can go home, and I can take care of my future baby mama or I can get this party started".
And, Grace, I got that party started.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's a really good song.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
And, of course, there's nothing going on with you and that horse guy.
It's okay, sweetie.
Guys are weak.
Women are tougher.
We're more reliable.
We can take care of ourselves.
Men go out and get the food.
Women protect the nest.
Maybe you're right.
No, I mean it.
Go and get the food.
I want some yogurt.
Don't forget to get it punched because they don't offer.
All right.
I'll get the food.
You stay here and protect the nest.
And by the nest, of course, I mean your hair.
And by protect, I mean, run a comb through it.
"I can't stop thinking about you.
Call me.
Signed, Leo's Horse".
I can't.
Okay, Lionel train.
Get your caboose up here !
Oh.
Oh, why, Stanley, I didn't smell you come in.
Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
I don't hear a baby crying.
She must still be in labor.
She's not giving birth, you nitwit.
She's taking a pregnancy test.
Here.
Sweet, maybe you should try it like the girl on the box.
She's she's arching her back and throwing her arm up and smiling.
I can't do this with all of you listening !
All right, we're moving.
- We're in the kitchen now.
- Ooh, such a long walk !
So far !
That's the worst fake moving I've ever heard !
C'mon.
Don't get all cozy with me, Wilma !
I'm still mad at you !
You shoulda told me Stan was gettin' outta the hoosegow.
Hey.
Who knew he was gonna cut some deal with the Feds ?
The only reason I found out was I saw the full-page ad in the New York Times: "Welcome back, Stan.
Love, your friends at Pizza Hut".
Wait he didn't find out about your affair, did he ?
No.
Thank God my boobs are like arms.
I was able to distract Stan with one of them, while the other one motioned for Lionel to get out the door !
C'mon, Grace !
You peed on everything else in that bathroom !
Why don't you just put the stick at the bottom of the shower ?
Hey, Jack C'mere.
Stop bothering me.
Jack, if there's somewhere else you need to be Hey, what could possibly be more important than my best friends creating a new life ?
Oops, time to stalk Kevin Bacon !
Will & Grace Saison 5- Episode 2 Bacon And Eggs sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Kevin Bacon's stalker log, My heart is racing and so am I. Moving in for a closer look !
Hmm, new plant in living room.
Must be gift from studio wooing "La Bacon" to do Hollow Man II.
Note to self: See if I can get a job applying body makeup.
Satin !
Soft !
Manly !
Must remember this for fantasy dream later !
- Honey, I got it !
- Abort !
Abort !
Abort !
Kyra !
Kyra !
I gotta go because my hair's almost dry, and if it gets too dry, then I can't put the gel in it.
Well, then it won't look good !
And now it's too late and it's dry.
Thanks a lot.
Look, babe, I I gotta go.
I'm interviewing assistants !
Hey, you're not the only busy one, okay ?
Guys ?
Come on in.
We'll do it in here.
I'll call you later.
Okay, I love you too.
Bye.
Look, um, uh, I I feel like I should tell ya I-I've never had a personal assistant before, okay ?
See, I've never bought into that whole Hollywood thing, you know ?
Premieres, limos, paying people over minimum wage.
And it's not because I'm cheap, okay ?
It's just that I'm not Hollywood.
I'm in a band.
The Bacon Brothers !
That's the name of his band !
He's in a band.
It's called the Bacon Brothers.
Right.
Very good.
Very good.
You're right.
And by the way, if anybody wants a CD, there's a bunch of them in a shoebox on the dryer.
They're, uh, 12 bucks.
Please, sit.
So I was thinkin', instead of doing some boring interview, it might be better to kinda find out what you know about me.
I'm sorry, that sounds vain me and my career.
First film Animal House !
Character's name in Footloose Ren MacCormack !
Number of films with full frontal nudity four !
Number of films with full sidal nudity three !
Number of films with rear frontal nudity priceless !
- Impressive.
- Thank you !
The rest of you can go.
You know nothing about me.
I gotta see the result.
No !
No, we've gotta wait for the timer.
This is such a huge moment !
Two huge moments.
We finally found a use for the butter dish.
By the way, we're never using it again.
I can't wait, I'm looking.
- No !
No !
- Grace !
I just With my fashion sense and your freakish upper body strength, this kid could take over the world !
You ready ?
- Yeah.
- All right.
The doctor said that it doesn't always work the first time, right ?
That's right, that's right, we'll try again in two weeks.
You know, when you're ovulating again.
It'll be fun.
I like ovulating.
You know, I guess I should stop eating for two.
Why stop now ?
You've been doing it since you were 11.
I gotta talk to you about something important, okay ?
Okay, um, should we maybe go out and do it in the street so people can see us together ?
And and if it leads to a dance, so be it ?
Dude, dude, let's get something straight, all right ?
I didn't hire you to be my pal.
You're just here to make sure the S.S. Bacon stays its course.
So, uh, we're not gonna dance ?
'Cause, uh, you kind of implied in the interview there would be some dancin'.
No, I didn't !
I did not !
And would you stop bringin' that up please ?
Sit !
This is serious.
This is gonna freak you out but - I have a stalker.
- No !
Are you sure ?
Damn it !
Kyra didn't believe me either !
Why is it so hard for everyone to believe that I would have a stalker ?
- Just find him for me, all right ?
- Oh, I'll find me him !
And when I find him, I am gonna stop me him.
Okay.
But it's not gonna be easy.
This guy is slippery.
If I had a dollar for every time my jock strap had been stolen from the gym You'd have $186 !
It's just an expression !
Karen ya gotta put an end to it with Lionel.
I mean, a husband and a lover ?
I mean, when are you gonna find time to ignore your kids ?
I know !
Honey, I've tried, but every time I go to break up with him, he flashes those pearly caps and I end up bent over the minibar.
End up ?
Isn't that where you started ?
So that's why I sent my number one goon there to break up with him for me.
- Rosario ?
- Yeah.
I kept her tied up outside without food for two days, so she should be extra ornery.
Listen, honey, I'm gonna go grab some lunch with some of the other gals from the typing pool.
Oh !
It's Zoey's birthday.
Fran made cupcakes.
Cupcakes !
Friggin' nutbag.
Ca-ray-zy !
Am I interrupting something ?
Oh oh, no, um, I was just, uh I I I have an assistant, and she's And do you see her now ?
Leo, why are you here ?
I just came by to apologize for putting my phone number in your wallet.
I I wouldn't have done that if I'd known your situation.
Pregnancy.
- I can say that, I'm a doctor.
- It's okay.
I don't think Emily Post covers leaving a note for a woman who's pregnant with her gay roommate's baby.
Oh, I I didn't know he was gay.
I just thought he smelled better than most women.
Except you, I mean, you you smell fantastic.
Thank you, it's Will's.
Anyway, um, I'm I'm not pregnant.
- It didn't take.
- Oh.
I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
- Well, in that case, maybe this would be a good time to ask you something Unbelievable !
I can't believe that you are hitting on me again !
I'm not hitting you, conceited !
I I just you know, wanted to know if you'd, uh, decorate my office.
I I'm serious, I just wanted to liven up my office a little bit with some of this stuff, This this kinda stuff.
A couple a these, you know, like like this weirdness.
Does this come in a couch ?
Because, I tell ya, it's very Ok, give that !
- I like - You put that down and - You just give Let me have this !
- No, let Give it to me !
Hey !
I usually don't have to work this hard, you know.
I have a nice job.
And I'm pretty much gonna have this hair until I'm 80.
What do you think ?
I just can't right now.
So that means that you have to go now.
I don't have to go.
I've got a transplant at 2:30.
- But the kidney's in the cooler, so, II - Okay, good-bye.
- Hold my hand.
- What ?
C'mon, hold my hand.
All right.
Look at that.
That should be me.
I can't believe we didn't get pregnant.
Maybe my swimmers just weren't ready for the responsibility.
I mean, all they ever had to do before was just jump out and go "whoopee "!
Or maybe they're just a little shy, and they need a little encouragement.
C'mon, let me help Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play.
I can't believe, in all the time I've known you, that I've had to say this twice, but my penis doesn't enjoy being sung to.
- Kneel down !
- What are you I said I'd hold your hand, but I draw the line No, we are stalking Kevin Bacon !
Come on !
Come on !
Get in !
I thought you were his assistant !
It turns out he only needed an assistant to find the stalker.
If I stop stalking, he doesn't need an assistant.
I had to re-stalk to keep my job and realize my dream of dancing with him in a cornfield.
- Come on, catch up, slow mo !
- This is ridiculous !
I swear if I had anything better to do with my life I'd be outta here like a shot !
I left him a cardboard cutout of himself signed "Nice stalkin' to ya".
Let's tune in and see how he reacts.
Okay, okay.
All right, he's seeing it, but he's not he's not moving !
Oh, my God, it's like something flattened him !
Perhaps you're looking at the cardboard cutout, dinkus.
Fel-low ?
Oh, hey, Kev.
Hey !
What's that ?
Oh, you're breakin' up, where are you ?
You're outside of your apartment ?
You're standing right next to me ?
What are you wearin' ?
- What are you doing, man ?
- I um, I I I I I found your stalker !
There is a logical explanation for this.
- And now you're touching me.
- And now I'm touching you.
Karen, thanks for taking me out to dinner.
I was kind of hoping I'd have a little baby in here, but I guess a little baby back ribs will do.
Well, honey, it's like the old song goes anyone deserves a free meal after having Will's sperm inside them.
I think that was from "You're a Gay Dad, Charlie Brown".
Oh !
Pull over right here, Driver !
Oh !
Rosie's comin' with.
She's up there breakin' up with Lionel for me, so I thought I'd take her out too and get this supportive friend thing over with in one trip.
Hey, honey, how'd it go ?
- I couldn't do it.
- What ?
What a man, what a man, what a man, what a mighty good man !
- Oh, Ro-Ro, ya didn't !
- I did !
I'm only a woman.
Well, half of you is.
Well, you leave me no choice.
I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and, uh, - send Grace in there to do it for me.
- What ?
No way !
I'm not breakin' up with him !
I'm just here for the ribs and maybe some corn on the side.
This is your responsibility.
No, no, honey I can't !
You don't know what it's like to turn away somebody who is irresistible !
Don't I ?
I just met the perfect guy.
He's cute and smart and funny.
His worst qualities are that he's a Jewish doctor !
But I made a promise to Will, so I turned him down.
- Is Will still gay ?
- Yes.
- Idiot.
- Hey !
No, no.
Grace is right.
We made commitments to our husbands.
Nothing's more important than that.
I'm just gonna have to march up there and tell Lionel "You're sleazy and shameless.
I hate that, and we're through "!
You're sleazy and shameless !
I like that, but we're through !
- You're my one true love !
- But you're not mine !
I love Stan !
Stan loves ham ham I am !
Good-bye !
Round two.
Look, it's not me.
Okay ?
Jack's your stalker !
I mean, after he saw you in Apollo 13, he went to every video store in Manhattan trying to find Apollo's 1 through 12 !
Come on, hot shot.
There are no cops here, all right ?
It's just you and me.
Two regular joes.
Me a Golden Globe nominee for The River Wild and you, a guy who just happened to be outside my apartment with binoculars.
I admit that looks bad, but you've gotta believe me !
I just I don't care that much about you.
Oh, really ?
Then explain this !
Go ahead, kiss it.
I know you want to !
And by the way, the Golden Globe nom was a total surprise, but it really meant something, you know, 'cause it's not from your peers, it's from the Hollywood Foreign Press.
- It's not me !
- I think it is !
- I'm leaving !
- Please don't go !
- What ?
- Stay !
Come on, we'll we'll split a Shasta, we'll we'll bust open a box of Hydrox !
Whatdya say, cap'n ?
I'm no expert, but shouldn't you be calling the police rather than offering me snacks and calling me "cap'n" ?
Look, when the stalkers leave, it's the first sign that your career is slipping.
It's a little tidbit I picked up from Val Kilmer.
You you did a movie with Val Kilmer ?
No, but Val was in Top Gun with Tom Cruise, and Tom was in A Few Good Men with me.
Huh, that was a short one.
Your fans are never gonna leave you, you're a great actor.
You're lookin' good, your hair's workin'.
You've got the waist of a 14-year-old girl I mean, look at that, that's crazy !
Oh, stop.
What was your favorite Kevin Bacon performance ?
Oh, wow I don't I don't know, I - I loved you in Footloose.
- Oh, yeah, you saw that ?
- Yeah.
- Any other faves ?
No, actually, that's the only one I liked.
But but, I I liked it a lot.
You know, I even learned the dance, for our high school talent contest.
- Did you win ?
- Nah.
I got a nom.
But it meant a lot because it didn't come from my peers, it came from the gay head of the drama department.
Could you, uh, do it for me now ?
I don't know, it's kinda weird.
I don't even know if I remember it.
And besides, there isn't even any, uh It's a little more arms.
Stop it !
Enough !
Stop it !
Stop it !
You shouldn't be dancing with him !
He's not your stalker; your stalker's still at large !
- But you fingered this guy !
- I did not !
We were just holding hands !
Your stalker's been throwing pebbles at your window for the last 15 minutes.
Or maybe you didn't hear me because the music was so loud !
You you're my stalker.
I prefer the term "professional crazed fan".
A job that's a hell of a lot more satisfying than sewing Prada labels in your Old Navy shirts !
Go get yourself a new assistant !
If you need me, I'll be in your hamper.
Hey, man, I'm sorry.
I owe you an apology.
I don't know how I can make it up to you.
Five, six, seven, eight !
What are you doin' ?
You would not believe the night I had.
Kevin Bacon caught me in the bushes outside his apartment, and we ended up dancing together !
I thought Jack was stalking him.
Yeah, he was, but then I was for a little bit.
I can't wait to tell our kid that his dad danced with Kevin Bacon.
Well, that should save you the trouble of telling him you're gay.
Do you realize that in two weeks, that kid could be on his way ?
Yeah.
Two weeks.
Ooh, I've gotta get over to Jack's.
Quicksilver's on WE.
Women's Entertainment.
Wheee !
Leo, hey.
It's Grace Adler from the lamppost and the horse and the coffee shop and my office.
Listen, um call me.
Excuse me, I'm working !
- Hi.
- I Uh I thought you might be cold so I brought you some coco.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
That would be fifty cents.
- I don't have any.
- Too bad.

{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
- So this was Will's cradle.
- Yeah.
- You and your chubby little cheeks.
- Ha.
- A little wisp of hair on top.
- Yeah.
Hey, what'd you look like as a baby ?
I'll have you know, I was an extremely pretty child.
Not that there's any photographs to prove that.
I was the youngest of three.
By then my parents were like "He's walking.
Should we get the camera ?
Nah.
I'll remember it".
So this is fun.
Fixin' stuff.
- Sandin' things.
- Uh-huh.
- Workin' up a sweat.
- Hmm.
- Makes me feel like a man.
- Yeah.
No, seriously, I'd like a man after we're done.
Grace is gonna love this.
It's gonna mean so much more, 'cause I worked on it with my own hands.
Just like I did with the new kitchen.
You gonna pay someone to come in and finish it ?
Yep, just like I did with the new kitchen.
You know what's even better than being carpenters ?
Bein' The Carpenters.
On the day that you born the angels got together Jack, stop it.
Come on, we gotta finish this.
And decided to create a dream come true so they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden starlight in your eyes of blue !
And I wonder why I'm still single.
Oh, speaking of which Hey, I got a surprise for you.
I got us some twins for tonight.
One's cute, one's smart, one's straight, one's gay.
Just like us.
You're sure it was twins, and not just one guy taking his glasses on and off ?
Anyway, I can't.
Grace and I are really focused on this baby right now.
And we've made an agreement no dating.
This is the best date ever.
I thought you were getting bored around 4:00, and then I thought "Well, why would you be bored ?
I'm a catch".
So, Leo, being a "doctah" You must hate it when people hit you up for free medical advice ?
Yeah, yeah I do.
It's the worst Whaddya need ?
Sometimes I taste pennies You know, in my mouth.
That's like a stroke thing, right ?
It can be.
Let me ask you something.
This is where you're gonna see the whole doctor thing start working.
Do you keep your mints in your change purse ?
I don't think I've ever been more embarrassed.
Until now.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
- I thought you were, y'know - Yeah.
Leanin' in to I was just grabbin' grabbin' my my sweater.
I I can, uh, put it back and, uh, grab it again, if you want me to.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 3 The Kid Stays Out Of The Picture sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ - Can I ask you something ?
- Ooh, serious voice.
Let me do my Oprah listening pose.
You know Grace is gonna be inseminated again in a few days, and I really think we're gonna get pregnant this time.
And if we do, I just want to make sure that our child is surrounded by good people.
I hear ya Bye.
No, Jack.
Jack, I'm asking you to be my kid's godfather.
Well, or, rather, his his fairy godfather.
Oh, my Oh, my God !
I'd be honored.
I'd be moved.
That pays, what ?
Like $100, $200 a week ?
It pays nothing.
Well, then, I'm just honored.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey !
Look at this !
It's my cradle, from when I was a baby.
My mom sent it over.
Along with a baby picture that says "Second or third child, March '70" with a question mark.
Jack and I are gonna have it painted.
Pink if it's a girl, and hot pink if it's a boy.
And flannel if it's a lesbian.
So, what do you think ?
Do you love it ?
Are you gonna cry ?
Do you need a tissue ?
It's cute.
I can't believe you ever fit in there.
'Night, guys.
You'd think Grace could show a little appreciation.
I mean, I've been working my gay dad ass off all day.
I sanded this cradle partially.
You know, I even child-proofed the kitchen cabinets.
Yeah, uh, about that I'll show you how to open them later.
- What's up with her ?
- Ugh, Will.
Do you know nothing about the "wimmins" ?
They don't respond to pressure.
- I'm not pressuring her.
- You're all about the pressure !
The baby's not even here yet, and you're already making Grace feel like a bad mother.
There's plenty of time for that after the baby gets here.
That's not what she needs now.
And I should know.
I am a mother.
You're a father.
Oh, difference of one letter.
This is the time you gotta stop focusing on the baby and focus on her.
Pamper her.
Buy her somethin'.
And buy me something, too, 'cause I just worked my ass off caring.
Will, help me.
It's hard.
Sorry I'm late.
I was caught on the 'F' Train.
Or as I now call it, the F-ing Train.
Oh, honey, is this another one of your fantasy stories about how people travel beneath the city in a secret underground network of tunnels and trains.
It's almost as crazy as the stories I tell you about those mythical places in the desert, where people go to stop drinking.
Somebody got some flowers, huh ?
Or as I like to call them, poor people's jewelry.
Oh, God.
They're from Leo.
Please, let the card be dumb.
Please, let him quote an Eagles song lyric or put a happy face over an "I".
Anything.
It's literate and delightful.
Who ?
Huh ?
What's this ?
Is this someone you met in your "underground city" ?
Leo.
Jewish doctor guy ?
I went out with him.
He's so amazing, but I'm supposed to get inseminated tomorrow.
God, it's just it's all just happening so fast.
Honey, what's the big deal ?
Just tell Wilma you need a little more time to see what's happening with cute doctor Jew.
I can't ask for more time.
We're not supposed to be dating.
- Will's head will explode.
- Honey, it will not.
He cares about ya.
He wants you to be happy.
You think ?
No.
Oh !
But if you buy him a present, it might soften the blow.
- No, that'll never work.
- Well, sure it will, honey.
The gays love their presents.
Yeah, just wave something shiny in front of their faces, you can get whatever you want.
That's how we got Manhattan from the gay Indians.
Ugh.
Damn it.
If only I hadn't kissed Leo.
Two weeks ago, I wanted this baby more than anything.
And and now, I'm just I'm just so confused.
Honey, what is the problem ?
- It was just a kiss.
- Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.
It was a really good kiss.
Sh-yeah !
Show me.
- No.
- Come on.
We're both stoned.
- Forget it.
- Shut up and show me.
Yeah, you're screwed.
That's not a curl.
That is not a curl.
Now that's a curl.
God, there's so many things I want to teach my son.
Oh Good.
You're here.
Um, hi.
Listen.
There's there's something I need to talk to you about.
And it's it's kind of important.
Yeah ?
Is it more important than this gift I got you ?
I think it is, but give it to me anyway.
Oh, my God !
The wrapping is so beautiful !
All these beads and glitter.
Add a couple of spaghetti straps and a hint of butt crack, and it's an Academy Awards gown !
Hmm.
Well, I'm not some thoughtless schlub that just gives a gift in the bag it came in.
I'm not an animal.
- I got you something too.
- Oh.
Let's open it together !
All right, well, you may need scissors to get through that, because Oh, my God !
I love it !
How did you do that ?
I used double-sided tape and glue !
I used unmanicured nails and that one jaggedy tooth I never got fixed.
Oh, a foot massager.
This is so sweet of you.
Thank you.
- Okay, now open mine.
- Okay.
It's so beautiful, I almost don't want to unstaple it.
Just open it.
Wow, a a personal cooling system.
Hey, it works !
You know how I am always the perfect temperature, and you are always freakishly hot ?
Well, the salesman said put this on, and you will freeze your nipples off.
And it's true, 'cause there's a spare pair in the box.
Wow !
That's great !
Can't wait to use that at the beach.
Me and my billabongs, with a metal collar around my neck.
Should attract an interesting subset of gay men.
Look, if you don't like it, you can always exchange it for those turbo nose hair trimmers that you always make fun of but secretly want.
What are you talking about ?
Come on.
I hear the sobbing from the bathroom every time you go at that jungle with the tweezers.
- Go ahead, exchange it.
- Hey, hey, yo hey, pretty.
Does this look like the face of someone who doesn't like his gift ?
I love that we don't need a reason to buy each other presents !
So I've gotta talk to you about something.
I know that we are supposed to get inseminated tomorrow.
But the last couple of weeks, um everything just seems to be moving so fast.
And I just wish that I had just just a little more time, because, um God, this is so hard.
Sweetie, I think I know what you're gonna say.
- You do ?
- Yes.
I'm rushing things.
God, you're not even pregnant yet, and I'm way ahead of myself.
By the way, our kid's on the waiting list for Dalton.
- So - Will I know, I know.
I've been putting way too much pressure on, so let's let's wait a month.
Take a little breather.
That's not gonna change anything.
I mean, I certainly ain't got nothin' better goin' on.
And we know you don't, right ?
- Right.
- Great.
So we're cool.
I know I am.
Oh, there go the nipples.
So how'd Grace like the gift ?
Did she get all emotional ?
Did she cry like a boy ?
Yeah.
She loved it.
You know Grace and her feet.
They're almost inseparable.
And she gave me something too A great present.
- The one we're here to return ?
- That's the one.
Gonna trade it for those turbo nose hair trimmers ?
No !
Anyway, thanks for the advice.
You really helped.
You don't have to thank me, Will.
I'll be rewarded in a better place.
Oh, look, we're in a better place.
Reward me !
Why don't you roll over in that massage chair and reward yourself.
- Hi.
- Can I help you ?
I'd like to exchange this.
Would ya like to look at our catalog ?
No.
I pretty much know what I want.
Um I'm a gardener.
And I garden in these these little holes the size of of, well, nostrils.
And I just I need something that I can really get in there and and dig out all that extra, uh, foliage.
Well, we have these nose hair trimmers Nose hair trimmers !
Wow, that hadn't occurred to me.
- If you think it'll work in my garden.
- I'll have someone get them.
God, I'd hate to be behind you when you're buying condoms.
Will, I found it.
The single CD shower companion.
'Cause you can never have too many companions in the shower !
Jack.
Isn't that why your membership to the Y was revoked ?
Ooh, check out the man-cake at the counter.
I know that guy.
That's that horse guy.
Oh, me likes the sound of that !
Come on, intro-seduce me.
Yeah, I'd like to, uh, exchange this foot massager.
My girlfriend got it as a gift, and she was gonna return it herself, but she's kind of embarrassed 'cause she thinks her feet are kinda big.
I happen to think she has great feet.
I offered to do it for her 'cause I'm trying to impress her.
Say, what is it about you that makes people just wanna open up ?
Uh-oh.
Your horse guy's straight, Will.
He's talking about Grace.
Ooh, then maybe there's hope.
Oh, honey, I didn't sleep a wink all night.
I don't know if it was worrying about you, or those Mexican amphetamines I've been taking, but I have to know what happened with Will.
- How'd he like his gift ?
- Oh, he loved it.
- Oh.
- And he said he'd he'd give me some more time.
Honey, that's great.
So I helped someone.
Hopefully, this will count toward my community service.
I'm sick of pickin' up trash in the park with that kid from "The Sopranos".
The only thing is, is I may have accidentally lied a little.
I didn't tell him about Leo.
Now, Grace what have I always told you about lying ?
That it's good.
But it didn't feel right.
I've got tell Will the truth the whole truth.
Well, maybe it's for the best.
Then you and I can move on with our lives.
Out in the open to love freely.
Karen, we're not a couple.
Aren't we ?
No.
Well, all I know is when I woke up this morning, there was red hair on my pillow and lesbian porn in the VCR.
- Hey, ladies.
- Hey, hey.
Hey, ladies.
My feet are killing me.
We just walked like 30 blocks.
Oh.
Can I get ya something to drink ?
She's buttering him up.
She didn't tell him about Leo.
Ya know what I'd really like ?
Where's that new foot massager ?
He's setting her up.
He knows about Leo.
You don't need the electric massager.
- I will rub your feet.
- No, no, get it.
I wanna try it.
- I don't have the massager, okay ?
- She gave it to her guy.
- He's a really good kisser.
- How good a kisser ?
What happened to it ?
Did your boyfriend take it back to The Sharper Image ?
He's not my How did you know about that ?
I saw him there when I was returning that stupid personal cooling system.
You returned the personal cooling system ?
Why didn't you just tell me that you didn't like it ?
I don't know.
Why didn't you tell me you wanted more time because of some guy ?
- Hey, you want me to show you ?
- Show me.
- Get out !
- Damn, Leo's good.
I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you.
I started to tell you.
And then you were so understanding.
And then there were gifts and curled ribbons Grace, Grace, bottom line.
Do you wanna have this baby with me, or not ?
You said I could have more time.
That was before I found out you were sneakin' around behind my back.
If you wanna back outta this, I want you to back out now.
I don't wanna have this conversation again in a month like we did with the cabinets.
"I like the nickel pulls.
No, I like the brass pulls.
Oh, no, I like the nickel pulls again".
Make up your friggin' mind !
So what you're saying is, if I don't do it tomorrow, - you don't want to do it at all ?
- That's right, Grace.
It's now or never.
Well, if that's the case, I guess I have to go with never.
Oh, I can't believe this !
This is only the most important thing we've ever done together, and you flake out on me ?
I don't know why that's surprising.
- You're a flake !
- I am not a flake !
Oh, please.
The dinners you blow off, the dry cleaning you forget to pick up, the rent that's late every month, and it's always been this way, Grace.
You skipped out on my law school graduation party before I cut the cake.
- That was a big deal.
- It was carrot cake !
That's never a big deal !
But I always let it go, Grace, because it's not like we're making a baby or something.
Except this time, we're making a baby !
Yes, at the moment you say, the place you say, wearing the clothes you say.
You are a control freak !
All I asked for was one month, one month to see where this is going.
Oh, let me tell you where this is going.
You'll end up hating him in three weeks, because I don't know, he has a weird chest hair pattern, or he doesn't like watching E !
Or he'll end up hating you, because you're too needy.
Then you'll fall apart, I'll pick you up, and then, magically, you'll be ready to have a baby !
So that's what you think of me.
Look, I'm sorry that I met someone, 'cause I know how much you hate it when I'm happy.
- Oh, that is such a load - Admit it.
You're happiest when I'm miserable.
I mean, come on.
Isn't that our thing ?
Because then you don't have to look at how miserable you are.
Shut up, Grace !
But I am not gonna be miserable for you.
I am gonna try to be happy, and if you can't deal with that, then you are even more pathetic than I thought !
- Get out of here.
- Go to hell !
No, I mean it !
I want you out of here in two weeks !
You don't live here anymore.

- Go to hell !
No, I mean it !
I want you outta here in two weeks.
You don't live here anymore.
I don't know how much longer I can live with Will.
I mean, every time I get in the shower with him, he's like "Jack, get the hell out".
I know, honey.
Grace is driving me nuts, too.
She can't concentrate on work anymore.
She just sits around all day, doodling pictures of people's houses on these enormous sketch pads.
And then, she's on the phone all the time, ordering furniture ?
Honey, where's she gonna put all that, huh ?
In these "houses" she's drawing ?
So we need to get them back together But how ?
Pretend to think, pretend to think.
Pretend to care, pretend to care.
Ooh, I got it.
What we need is a plan.
Some way to get them in the same room together.
Oh, honey, that's genius.
Write that down.
Oh, wait, not on that.
That's for Will and Grace.
That's an invitation to Joe and Larry's kid's birthday party.
Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too.
Anyway, enough about that.
We have to figure out a way to get them in the same room so they can work it out.
But how ?
How ?
I just got a paper cut on this party invitation for Will and Grace.
Focus !
We're trying to get them in the same room together.
Forget about this party they're both invited to.
Now, what do they both like ?
Well, Will likes to be taller than everybody and Grace likes to eat cake.
Where can we take them where there'll be small people eating cake ?
Oh !
Shoot, I just spilled on this invitation to a child's birthday party.
Hey Are you thinking what I'm thinking ?
I don't know.
Are you thinking what it would be like to have Spiderman spray his web on you ?
Okay, that's just freaky.
Okay, that's crazy.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 4 Humongous Growth sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ You sure you don't wanna go to Joe and Larry's kid's party ?
You'll tower over people.
I do like to feel tall.
Ah, I don't know.
Grace and I already said we weren't going, and besides, I don't think I'd be very good company right now, anyway.
Okay But, uh, when couples split, one person always gets the good friends.
So if you don't kiss up to Joe and Larry first, you'll end up like the ex-Ms. Giuliani.
He got the two cool gay guys, and all she got was a part in The Vagina Monologues.
Please.
They're not gonna choose Grace over me.
They love me.
And if that's not enough, Joe got drunk one night and let it slip about his Internet chat buddy.
That's my ace in the hole.
And that's actually the guy's screen name.
All right.
But don't blame me when the dust settles and Grace is grand marshal at the Gay Pride Parade and you're stuck in Fort Lee doing The 'Gina Monologues.
Hi, this is Grace Adler.
I'd like to take Will Truman off my Video East renter's card.
Well, if you must know, he tried to force me to have a baby and give up a chance at true love, and that kinda person shouldn't be able to rent videos.
Thank you.
Honey, you're being so spiteful and vindictive.
Compliments ?
This early in the day ?
Oh, honey, you're always the life of the party.
Oh, speaking of parties, would you like me to "RSTD" to Moe and Mary ?
Uh, I don't know, Karen.
I'm really not in the party mood.
There'll be a nice cake.
I do like a nice cake.
Besides, you need to go over there and make nice with Joe and Larry.
You don't want them going over to Will's side.
They're gay.
They belong to you.
I'm not worried about them.
I have been a true and loyal friend.
Besides, one night, Larry got drunk and let some things slip about his secret Internet chat buddy, - so he ain't goin' nowhere.
- Okay, honey.
Don't blame me if Will is empress of gay America and you're in Fort Lee doing The Vagina Monologues.
Okay ?
- What ?
- I don't know.
Look at this place, Will.
Everyone's screaming and jumping all over each other.
Why can't grownups have a place like this ?
We do, Jack.
It's known as last call in any gay bar, U. S. A. - Hey, guys !
- Hey !
Thanks for coming.
- Good to see you.
- How are you ?
Hey, how's the party going ?
Any cute fathers ?
Well, actually, there's this one really hot No.
Ooh, I got Hannah a little something.
- Oh, Will, you shouldn't have.
- Don't be silly.
You guys are my best friends.
Hannah's my goddaughter, and I just mean the world to all of you.
- It's from both of us.
- It's actually kinda cool.
I adopted her an endangered panda from The Discovery Store.
You get a certificate and a pamphlet about the threat to the environment.
It's from Will.
It's even better than that mile of highway you had cleaned up in her name.
I just figured, you know, it's better than some garish, flashy gift with a lotta bells and whistles that she's just gonna get tired of in five minutes Whee !
Where's the birthday girl ?
Auntie Grace is here.
- What are you doing here ?
- What are you doing here ?
Yay !
They're in love again !
I don't mean to interrupt, but is Hannah allowed to cut her own hair ?
- You gave her a soda !
- It's her birthday !
- You said you weren't coming.
- So did you.
Ha-ha !
Too late !
You're friends now.
- Suckers !
Woo-hoo !
- High five !
Why, you you two planned this ?
Just to get us in the same room ?
Not just getting you in the same room, no.
But getting you in the same room at the same time !
- Woo-hoo !
- Low two !
Stop it.
This is not a joke !
Why can't you two just mind your own business ?
Wow.
Some people.
Trick 'em into doing something they don't wanna do and this is the thanks you get ?
Come on, honey.
While we're here, let's go pick on a gay kid.
- Hey, I was that gay k - Shake your skirt, fairy !
Well, I guess one of us should leave.
- Yeah, you.
Bye-bye.
- I'm not leaving.
- I brought a present.
- I brought a present, too.
- What is that ?
Your phone bill ?
- It's a panda.
Oh, God, not the endangered species thing again ?
You remember what happened when you gave that to your nephew at Christmas ?
Where's my panda ?
Where's my panda ?
I'll tell you where your panda is, kid in China.
- It's educational.
- It's stupid.
Like like a Barbie in a string bikini is such a smart gift.
Why don't you just wrap a ribbon around bulimia ?
A doll cannot cause an eating disorder.
Nothing is that black and white.
A panda is.
Besides, I don't need to buy Joe and Larry's friendship with extravagant gifts for their kid.
That's not what I'm doing.
I'm here because I love Hannah.
Oh, really ?
And how old is she today ?
A lady never reveals her age.
I'm going to put my present on the table.
If you'd like, I'll put your envelope on the table with the savings bonds and the homemade cards.
In other words, the suck pile.
Kids love homemade cards.
- I hope this is apple juice.
- Let me help you there, Joey.
Joe-Joe.
Jay-Jiminy-Jee-Joe.
Look, Will, I would appreciate it if you didn't get high around the kids.
I'm not high.
I'm just joking with you.
That's what old friends do.
We joke.
Except maybe Grace.
She'd probably tell you half a knock-knock joke, and then blow you off for some guy on a horse.
How much of that stuff did you smoke ?
Kids, don't eat the balloons !
They're poison.
- Will, do you mind ?
- Nope.
No problem, pal.
I'm on it.
And I'm in it.
Where's your kid ?
Where's my kid ?
Oh, I don't have a kid.
Not yet.
I'm thinking of adopting, though, which is fine.
You know, I'll still be a reliable father.
Some people are not reliable.
You should know this.
Some people think they're reliable, but when push comes to shove, and the pressure's on, - they prove themselves to be what ?
- Cheese ?
Unreliable.
Hey, Larry.
You look so good.
What's what's different about you ?
Except being the handsomest man in the world ?
God, your skin is so soft.
And what is under this shirt ?
A brick wall ?
Joe told me that you had some good stuff, but we're off that since Hannah was born.
What ?
Okay, but I don't wanna do too much, because I might freak out when the clown gets here.
No, I'm just touching you in a loving way.
Not a controlling way, like Will.
You know, Will thinks you're boring.
I think everyone is having a really good time.
Okay, kids, I'm gonna say this one more time: The balloons are not food !
Stay, I'll get it.
I'm allowed to talk to adults !
Wanna hold my bunny ?
I would love to, sweetheart.
He's my best friend.
Well, maybe he is now.
But wait.
He seems all sweet and cuddly.
Meanwhile, he's storing away all these secret resentments.
And then one day, when you've done absolutely nothing wrong, his hatred will explode !
Mommy !
Hey, kid !
Heads up.
Okay, no, not too much base.
And I want tabby eyes and Persian lips.
Honey, look at Will and Grace.
They haven't said a word to each other for over an hour.
- This plan bites !
- Well, it's better than yours Telling those kids those balloons are made of candy.
Kids are dumb.
I know.
I ate a balloon, it tastes nothing like candy.
Okay, we're ready.
Go get the kids around the big table, and please make sure the camera has film in it.
One time.
It happened one time.
Kids, sit down !
Cake !
- Happy - Let me help you with that.
- No, it's okay.
I I got it.
- No, I want to.
- Oh, Hannah's gonna love this.
- Oh, thanks, Grace.
I found it in the Cookbook for Gay Dummies.
- Hap - Just let let me take it out - Be careful - No, we've got it covered Larry, I'm so sorry.
- Here, let me help - Don't touch her.
Kids, we're going to the deli next door for birthday knishes.
Nice going, Grace.
Our friendship, a kid's birthday party, your over-processed hair.
Anything else you wanna destroy this week ?
I don't know, anything else you wanna blame me for, you big bitch ?
You're a mess.
I'm leaving.
- Don't bother.
I'll leave.
- No, no.
I'm leaving.
- I'm already gone.
Where's my purse ?
- Where's the guy with the - Damn it.
- Come on.
- We are not playing games here.
- Give me my purse.
Want 'em ?
Go get 'em.
Jack, what the hell are you doing ?
It's time you two patched things up.
- Unzip it !
- Will !
This is not the time or the place for your clumsy come-ons !
Now talk to her !
This is not funny.
Let us out now.
- I'm not kidding, Jack.
- I'm not kidding either !
ou guys' friendship means something to me.
It means that maybe we don't have to be alone in the world.
That some things do last forever.
That a fatty and his enabler can find love.
Come on, you're tearing the poor kid up !
So either get it together or get it apart.
Just get it !
Now come on, Jackie.
I hear there's some people here with some great dope.
I think I just stepped in a puddle of throw-up.
Throw-up makes me throw up.
Quit jumping.
You're gonna have two puddles.
- Please look.
Is that throw-up ?
- Look for yourself !
I'm not your vomit-looker.
I only look at vomit for my friends, and we are not friends.
Fine, then you're gonna have to find yourself another spider-killer.
I don't need you to kill spiders for me, thank you.
I can kill my own damn spiders.
What about the one above your head ?
- Quit bouncing.
- You quit bouncing.
- You quit bouncing !
- You quit bouncing !
You really hate me, don't you ?
Is this really happening ?
We just throw away 15 years of friendship over this ?
Don't say "over this" like it was nothing.
You screwed me over.
I'm planning my life around this.
You were gonna have a baby, I was gonna be a dad.
And then you just throw it away.
It was so easy for you.
Easy ?
Have you been paying any attention to my life lately ?
And since when has finding someone ever been easy for me ?
That is not the point, Grace.
You just met the guy and you picked him over me.
I couldn't pick him over you because you are not an option for me.
You know, I actually considered walking away from Leo for you.
But then I started thinking about what our life would be like.
Just you and me and our baby.
And that question hanging over my head.
What question ?
Was Leo the right guy for me ?
I don't know.
I don't know if it's gonna work out.
But I hope it does.
And I'd hope my friend would want that for me, too.
I'm sorry, Grace, but it's not that easy for me.
- Why ?
- Because it's not.
Because I need you more than you need me !
Okay ?
You you you you got a million options, Grace.
You can make a baby with Leo, or Nathan, or any Tom, Dick, and spermy.
But I can't.
I need you.
Well, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say to that.
Well, there's nothing you can say.
You've made your choice.
So, what, that's it ?
We're done ?
We're just gonna go our separate ways ?
I guess so.
- I hope it works out, too.
- What ?
I hope it works out between you and Leo.
- You do ?
- Of course I do.
- I love you, Grace.
- I love you, too, Will.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.
And I think you should still have your baby.
- There are other options.
- You know what I really want ?
I wanna do this the old-fashioned way.
I wanna meet a guy, fall in love Quit going to the gym, 'cause I met someone.
And then make a baby.
Do me a favor ?
Check the puddle ?
- It's macaroni and cheese.
- Oh, thank God.
- That may have been thrown up.
- Oh, no !

{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Hey, what do you want in your omelet ?
Hello ?
It's the week before Halloween.
Right.
So candy corn, Good 'n Plenty, and Reese's Pieces.
But make it with egg whites, it's healthier.
Oh, can you make another one ?
Leo's gonna join us.
Oh Leo How come every time I say Leo, you have to say "oh Leo" ?
Because I'm trying to make the passive-aggressive point that I'm not crazy about him.
I don't know why you haven't picked up on that.
You know, you could make an effort.
This guy's really important to me.
I could make an effort, but I wouldn't be able to go "oh Leo" all the time.
What are you doing ?
Well, you know, I like to dine al fresco, so I opened up a little café "Jacques".
"Cimanin" Did you know that Oh, God.
Two guys are already lining up for the next Star Wars movie.
I wanna show up in two years and cut right in front of them.
Adler, do you have two singles ?
I'm short.
I told the cab driver I was gonna get some money for his tip Screw it, I'm already here.
- Hi.
- Hey, Will.
Hey, Leo !
Great to see you, buddy !
Thanks for dropping by !
"Hey, Leo", I like that.
It's a lot better than "Oh Leo".
Yeah, how does "Goodbye, Leo" grab you ?
Oh, look at this.
Pumpkin picking day trips in the Catskills.
- We should do this.
- I know.
We always talk about it.
We really should do it this time.
We could rent bikes.
Bike up there.
Pick our own pumpkin.
I got a Jeep.
I could drive up.
We could all go together.
Sounds great !
Right, Will ?
Uh, sure.
Maybe.
I got a friend.
He loves to bike.
Maybe you would hit it off.
We could go Halloween, unless you have to work.
Uh, it's Halloween.
Excellent.
Oh, I gotta go.
My latte's probably ready.
Have you guys been to Jacques' ?
No, but I pass it every day on my way to work.
That bike trip's never gonna happen.
No, of course not.
Who does that ?
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 5 It's The Gay Pumpkin, Charlie Brown sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey.
You guys ready ?
I got the bikes, I got the Jeep.
I got the annoying clapping.
- Come on, let's do it.
- Do what ?
Pumpkins ?
Catskills ?
You know, the bike trip.
My buddy's in the lobby.
He's really excited.
Come on.
Pumpkins !
Outdoors !
Fresh air !
Let's raise the roof.
Too far.
He's kidding, right ?
We don't do things.
We talk about doing things, but we never do them.
I know.
Oh, God.
He thinks I do things !
A pumpkin-picking bike trip on a brisk fall day ?
It's madness !
You have to come.
Come on, it could be fun.
We're always saying we should be more spontaneous, right ?
Yeah.
I just didn't think it would happen so suddenly.
You okay, Kare ?
You haven't touched your Jack-accino.
Yeah, I am fine.
It's just this song.
Stan always puts it on whenever we're making love.
Or as I like to call it, being trapped under rubble.
Gosh, Kares, is it hard to be with him after almost having an affair ?
No, honey.
That's all behind us.
I don't even think about that anymore.
Ooh.
Look, I got a little spot on my jacket.
Out.
Out, damned spot.
Filthy whore !
I'm sorry, Stan, I almost cheated on you !
You know, I could probably take this to the dry cleaners.
Uh-oh.
I think your behavior is masking some deeper turmoil.
But what ?
Grr, psychology is so hard.
All right, listen.
I tell you what.
I'll take you to my gay group therapy.
They'll help.
No.
No more of your damn gay group therapy.
How many times you expect me to sit through "Mamma Mia" ?
Karen, I'm serious.
Come with me.
They'll help.
I used to have multiple personalities.
Now I'm only dating one guy.
Oh, and if anybody asks, your drag name is All-Beef Patty.
Sorry, there's a - Thanks for doing this.
- Well, I'm a good friend.
Who knows, maybe this guy Leo's bringing along is gonna turn out to be totally hot.
Hello.
- Will, this is my friend, Kim.
- It is nice to meet you.
Score.
Nice to meet you, too Kim.
Um, why don't you guys go on ahead, - and we'll meet you downstairs.
- Looking forward to it.
- Down, boy.
- Shut up, man.
You owe me big time.
- Or you owe her.
- Huh ?
Well, you see what you have there, don't you ?
I see what I don't have, the other half of my date.
What you have is a pocket gay.
A pocket gay ?
A pocket gay.
The perfect travel-size homosexual.
Just pop him in a man-purse, a briefcase, and you're good to go.
In ten years they'll be making 'em all that way.
And ever since it happened, I feel so guilty.
Well, I feel a little bit uncomfortable.
All of these gay eyes on me.
Judging me.
Undressing me.
Then dressing me up again in a different outfit.
Well, I can understand your reservations, Ms. Beef Patty.
But I just want you to understand that we don't judge in here.
But seriously, you do seem troubled.
But we understand what you're going through in here.
I mean, a lot of us in here have cheated Roger.
But I think that your conscience is telling you what you need to do.
I have to tell Stan, don't I ?
In here, we value honesty above all else.
All right, all right.
Come on, stop !
Little man, you wanna race ?
Oh, come on, Leo.
It's such a beautiful day, let's Psych !
God, Kim's like a machine.
Or a wind-up toy.
This sucks, riding around in this stupid yellow helmet.
It's like I'm on a bike trip with Curious George.
I know.
If this seat goes any further up my ass, I'm gonna have to take my underwear off with tweezers.
Fall off your bike.
Fall off.
You'll break something, we'll go back to the lodge, get a stack of pancakes, and end this rotten day.
- I'm not falling off.
You fall.
- He's your boyfriend.
- And Kim's your boyfriend.
- Hey, stop that !
- You stop !
- Can we just please enjoy this ?
God, I'm so sick of myself.
You know what ?
I'm making a change.
From here on, it's a new Grace.
And New Grace is gonna be adventurous and outdoorsy.
Like the girls on "Little House on the Prairie", but with makeup and sight.
Get off it.
There's no new Grace.
Nobody changes, and there's nothing new.
You're just jealous because in the last two minutes, I've matured and you haven't.
Any other pearls of wisdom from New Grace ?
Yeah.
Watch out for the pothole.
What does that mean, watch out for the pot-holy sh !
- You okay ?
- No !
Leo did this on purpose.
Clearly, this whole trip was planned to humiliate me.
I get the crappy bike, a micro-date, and a helmet that makes me look like I ride the special bus.
Now, Will, let's not rewrite history.
The yellow helmet was the only one that fit over your enormous forehead.
Whatever.
At least now, we get to go home, get away from all this fresh air and scenery, and spend Halloween like civilized people.
Getting hammered in a crowded bar.
I'm not going anywhere.
I meant what I said before about a new attitude.
I'm going to finish this bike trip.
Oh, please.
Nobody has a new attitude, and nobody finishes anything.
You know what, Will ?
You could stand to be a little more open-minded.
Let the new Will out.
Who knows, maybe New Will knows how to ride a bike.
They were a little bit low on medical supplies.
But it's cool.
You'll probably pass out from the blood loss before the excruciating pain kicks in.
Okay.
So what are we gonna do ?
- Head back ?
- No, are you kidding ?
Let's go.
Let's hit the road.
Ooh, sorry, Will.
Why don't you go ahead ?
I'll stay with Will.
But you owe me one.
I owe you nothing.
Shut up.
Get outta here.
Well, this is it, Jackie.
The moment of truth.
Gonna open those doors, walk into Stan's office, and tell him that I had an affair.
And that I feel awful about it.
I wish there was some way I could take it back.
Please forgive me !
Well, I feel better.
What do you say we get outta here ?
No, Karen !
No !
This isn't one of those ugly situations where you can just close your eyes and pray it will be over soon, like a Jennifer Love Hewitt movie.
- You have to deal with this.
- You're right.
'Course you're right.
Well, I feel better, what do you say we get out Karen, no !
Oh, why should I ?
- Because - Because why ?
One of the things I admire most about you is your ability to meet a challenge head on.
You see a difficult situation, and you tackle it.
You're strong.
You're fearless.
Your boobs are as high as an elephant's eye.
That's why I love you.
I'm gonna help you.
Okay.
I'm opening the door.
I'm closing the door.
Why ?
What happened ?
Karen, um, one of the things I admire about you is your ability to run from a challenge.
You see a difficult situation and you tackle it with a bottle of J&B.
You're weak.
You're a scaredy-cat.
Your elephant boobs are in my eye.
Let's go !
Come on !
Honey !
Get out of my way.
- I've gotta talk to Stanley.
- No, Karen, he's busy !
What what are you trying to hide, Heidi ?
Nothing !
Look, uh, a shiny object.
Stanley, that had better be me you're having sex with !
All right, just keep these puppies elevated, and we'll be dancin' in no time.
Legs don't heal, and nobody dances.
Look, you know, you really don't have to stay with me.
- I-I'm fine.
- It's okay, I want to.
Why ?
Because I like you, okay ?
I think you're cute.
Why do you say that ?
I'm not cute.
I'm grouchy.
I'm inflexible.
Give me a lawn chair and an open robe, and I'm my grandfather.
You see, and I think that's cute.
Ooh, your feet are freezing.
How's this ?
You don't have to do th Ooh, boy, that feels good Need some help ?
Please.
Would the Little House girls need help putting a chain back on their prairie bikes ?
I don't think so.
I am fine.
This is fun.
Well, take as long as you need.
I'm having a hell of a time admiring your ass.
Oh, good !
I got it on.
I did it !
Look !
How essential is this ?
Okay, this is not a problem.
This is an opportunity for more fun.
Okay ?
Guess that's why they call it a to-go cup.
- You okay ?
- Fine.
All I need now is another car to go by with a muffin and a paper.
Let me get you something to dry off with.
Here you go.
Thanks.
Fun !
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hi, Kare.
I hope you're not hungry.
The kitchen just closed.
No.
It's okay.
Hmm, quiet tonight.
- Well a holiday - Yeah.
Can I get you something to drink ?
Oh, yeah.
Bourbon on the rocks.
- Oh, we don't have a liquor license.
- I do.
So ?
It's been going on for months.
She works in the prison cafeteria.
The hairnet the pork chops how can I compete with that ?
Apparently, she had him at jello.
So, uh, what are you gonna do ?
Well Honey, I left him.
Sorry.
Trick or treat.
There it is.
I see the one I want.
It's orange.
Let's go.
Whoo !
Whoo !
I'm right behind you.
This is great.
I could be in a crowded gay bar right now, getting hammered.
Whoo !
Leo ?
Leo, where are ya ?
- Catch !
- Oh, motherf Oof !
Are you okay ?
What was I thinking ?
I guessed that you weighed more than the pumpkin.
Leo.
I have to tell you something.
I have been trying so hard to be someone that I'm - And it's raining.
- God.
- You even look beautiful wet.
- I know, but - There's something I gotta tell ya.
- You're having a crappy time.
I am.
I wish I weren't, but I am.
I'm wet and cold.
And I've got mud on my Juicy Couture shirt.
And I've inhaled four bugs.
Look, Leo, there is no New Grace.
It's just old Grace with pigtails and lower back pain.
And I know that you don't know what that means, but I do.
So you need a girl who likes to go outside and eat bugs, and I guess you're gonna have to find one, 'cause it ain't me.
That's a shame.
You were the right size and everything.
Hello ?
Coat hog.
When did you know I was hating it ?
When we passed that motel with free HBO, and a tear ran down your cheek.
I do love television.
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
Wanna get outta here ?
What's the rush ?
I'm starting to feel a little more outdoorsy.
You staying at Leo's tonight ?
Yeah.
What about you ?
Ugh.
I'm beat.
I'm probably just gonna crash.
Ok.
Goodnight.

{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Come on, Grace, hurry up.
I got an early meeting.
I knew when we installed that pulsating shower head it was gonna slow down our mornings.
- Grace !
- Who you talking to ?
I'm talking to you.
Now hurry up and get out of the bathroom.
Wait.
That is one smooth-talking shower head.
Will, it's happening again.
I'm having that dream where she's everywhere.
It's more interesting than that one about the hot dog breaking up with the doughnut.
What are you doing here ?
What, can't a friend stop by a friend's place for a quick shower ?
Why don't you shower at Marlo and Phil's ?
I thought that's where you've been staying since you left Stan.
Oh, I am.
It's been super cool.
Yeah, it's all braiding each other's hair, pillow fights, comparing breast size.
Then Marlo comes home, and the fun stops.
- Oh, look at the time.
I gotta fly.
- Karen ?
- Your hair.
- Oh.
Right, I forgot.
Thank you.
- How does it - Money.
That is so creepy.
People just appearing out of nowhere.
I know, using your apartment like it's their own.
It's rude is what it is.
What happened to manners ?
What happened to respect ?
What happened to tennis socks with the pom-poms on the back ?
There ain't nothing wrong with those.
Oh, Jack.
Cute as a button.
Not quite as smart.
You know what's going on with Karen, don't you ?
Reason why she has to shower here ?
The big secret ?
No, I don't.
Tell me.
- No.
- Tell me.
Fine, don't tell me.
Now I wanna tell you.
- No.
- Yeah, come on.
Fine.
Stan froze all her assets, she has no money, she's too proud to ask for help, so she's living in her limo.
Oh my God.
She's living in her limo ?
You heard that too ?
Who told you ?
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 6 Boardroom and A Parked Place sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ So don't lecture me on ethics, Eugene.
I don't care if there is no precedent.
If we don't put ourselves on the line for this guy, he's gonna fry, and I will not have that on my conscience !
And then Lara Flynn Boyle comes in and totally shuts him down.
- I love "The Practice".
- It's so good.
Anyway, back to business.
All those in favor of going to Beefsteak Charlie's for Sarah's birthday ?
T. G. I. Friday's ?
I'm sorry, the Charlies have it.
Okay.
Who hasn't signed the card ?
Uh, Will, listen.
I won't be able to go to the party.
- I'm going to the opera tonight.
- Love the opera.
Dressed up, hanging out with fabulous people.
Drinking champagne.
If it weren't for the damn music, it'd be a perfect evening.
Good tickets ?
Oh, the company box.
What ?
That is so unfair.
I've asked to use the company box like a hundred times.
- I never get to.
- That is unfair.
You should have these.
Too bad you don't.
Hey.
Hi, Will.
You won't believe who just got off the elevator.
Mr. Stein is back, and he's coming this way.
I love you, Will.
I mean, bye, Will.
Mr. Stein ?
Doucette's old partner ?
I thought he left the business.
No, no, he's been running the London office.
I never even met him.
Okay, look, who wrote "Sarah rocks" in bubble letters ?
You took up way too much space.
- Welcome back.
- It's very exciting to have you here.
Enough !
Sit.
As you may know, my partner, Ben Doucette, has retired.
And it's fallen on me to turn this company around.
You may think that just because I've been in London all this time that I've failed to notice this office's deficiencies.
Well I have.
Not !
You throw money away on new clients who never materialize.
Your billing system is rotten.
And the softball team has lost two years running to Spragg, Askins and Rovello.
And Rovello throws like a girl.
Rovello is a girl, sir.
Is that any excuse ?
You're right.
You're right, sir.
- What is this ?
- That's a birthday card for Sarah.
You can sign it if you want to, sir.
Right under the wheelbarrow of wishes.
You see, this is the kind of problem I'm talking about.
I know, I told them not to use bubble letters.
I This is a law firm.
And you are lawyers.
Not schoolgirls writing in a yearbook.
Unless I'm mistaken.
Are there any schoolgirls here ?
There it is.
There's Karen's limo.
- I don't think so.
- No.
No, it is.
See the red, green and yellow mark on the bumper where she hit that clown ?
The one outside Radio Shack ?
I don't know about that clown.
The one I'm talking about was outside the McDonald's in Times Square.
- That's a good McDonald's.
- Don't I know it.
So what's the plan ?
Well, since she's too proud to ask for our help, I say we get in there and we refuse to leave until she agrees to come stay with us.
Hey, are you wearing smarty-pants ?
'Cause that's a pretty good plan.
Well, maybe not smarty-pants, but perhaps a witty thong.
- Let's move in.
- Okay.
Oh, my god.
It's worse than I thought.
Yuh.
Karen's a bottom.
So, from now on, this is protocol.
You may not like it, you may not be used to it, but this is the way it's going to be.
Sorry, Mr. Truman.
Does my pounding disturb you ?
No, sir, it just caught me by surprise.
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll try to be more considerate in the future !
Okay, folks.
That wasn't easy for any of us, but I think we're gonna benefit from this new work ethic.
Uh, first things first.
Did anybody see where my troll went ?
Hello ?
- Occupied !
- Oh, sorry !
- Mr. Stein, what's wrong ?
- Nothing.
Can't a senior partner crouch on top of a toilet if he wants to ?
Of course.
Crouching's fine.
It was the whimpering that threw me.
- I'll just leave you.
- No, wait !
Wait.
I can't take it.
Oh, all the people staring at me.
Listening to my every word.
Why do they all stare ?
Because you were talking to them ?
You're doing it, too.
They all know, don't they ?
Where I've been all these years.
The London office ?
There is no London office.
You wanna know where I really was ?
I'll give you a hint.
That's right.
The loony bin.
The nut hatch.
Nana's change purse.
No wonder "London" is in quotes on the company letterhead.
You know, just between you and me, I wasn't ready to come back now.
But when Doucette left, I had to, to save the company.
I mean, it's Doucette and Stein.
If there's no Doucette, no Stein, what's the company gonna be called ?
"And" ?
I like you.
You're like a young me.
Do you know where my red wagon is ?
Uh, I'll have to check with mom.
Will you help me ?
Please ?
This pressure's too much.
I can't handle it alone.
Look at me.
I'm nuts.
Hey, I don't know what I can do.
Well, when I'm down and troubled and I need a helping hand and nothing, whoa, nothing is going right, close your eyes and think of me, and soon I will be there - Mr. Stein - To brighten up even Mr. Stein, Mr. Stein.
I'm sorry.
That's what they were playing when I had my last treatment.
I can't get it out of my head.
I'll do whatever I can.
Oh, good.
Great.
Thank you.
I have a lunch meeting with new clients at Le Cirque.
You go.
Use my expense account.
Le Cirque.
Well, okay, I'll have to cancel my table at Blimpie's, but And I have a court appearance at 9:00 and a deposition at 3:00.
Consider them covered.
Thank you.
You're helping me.
If there's anything that I can do for you Oh, please.
It's my job.
I'm happy to help.
But If you held a gun to my head Who told you about that ?
No, I'd like to use the company box at the opera sometime.
- Sure.
Tonight.
- I can't.
Gary's using it.
No, he's not.
It's yours.
Really ?
Thank you.
That's so unfair.
Poor Gary.
For the last time, I'm fine !
It's a temporary cash flow problem.
Now get out of my limo, bozo.
And take your little circus poodle with you.
Karen, we're not going anywhere unless you come with us.
Listen, I do not need your help, all right ?
I may be alone, broke, living in a car and spooning a domestic, but Karen Walker has her dignity.
Got it ?
Here.
Throw away my urine.
It's bad enough I have to do this at the mans.
Ugh.
Karen ?
Come on.
Stay with me.
No !
Kar, you may think I only love you for your money, but you know what else is true.
I care about you.
And that's why I pledge that we will stay here as long as it takes.
Very funny, putting a quarter on the bottom.
- Mr. Stein ?
I - Mr. Stein ?
Mr. Stein, it's me, Will.
Oh, Will.
How nice to see you.
How you doing ?
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
You ?
Wonderful.
I wanted to th Mr. Stein ?
Mr. Stei ?
Do you think it would it would be okay if you and I were If you and I were in the the same room together ?
I don't see why not.
Shall I wait here, then ?
Yeah.
Yeah, you wait right there.
I just w Mr. Stein !
I wanted to thank you for letting me use the company box last night.
The seats were so comfortable.
My ass couldn't stop talking about it the whole way home.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
It's the least I could do for all your help.
We need your signature on these before we can send them out.
Good.
Fantastic, sir.
Next time, we'll try signing your name.
You saved me again.
How can I thank you ?
Let me do something for you.
No, it's not necessary.
How do you like that corner office ?
The one with the French doors and the private bath ?
But that's Sarah's office.
She's had that for 30 years.
Mmm.
God bless her.
She deserves it.
What a treasure that woman is.
Oh, there she is now.
Oh, Sarah.
Sarah, dear.
You're fired !
Now clear out your office, darling.
Enjoy !
Last chance, Karen.
You gonna spend the night here Or we gonna go back to my nice, soft, comfortable bed ?
Good Lord.
You will do anything to get into my pants.
All right, then.
Let's go to sleep.
All right.
- Night.
- Night.
Noches.
Jack ?
That had better be your penis.
I can't do this.
I sleep on my left.
Turn.
Night.
Noches.
Grace ?
That had better be your penis.
It's a thermos, but thank you.
Rosario !
She keeps poking me with her - Oh, don't be saying that - Don't kick me !
- God, what is that smell ?
- What do you want me to do ?
Stop it !
This is crazy.
The only reason to spend a night in a limo is if the drummer in your prom band dropped a Quaalude in your Fresca.
Look, we get it.
Okay ?
We get it.
Going through a hard time right now.
You just left your husband.
But we're your friends and we love you.
And if we can't help each other out in the hard times, then what are we doing ?
Ditto.
You know Jack, what you say is right.
But no, I'm staying here !
- Why ?
- Why ?
Good Lord, Jack.
If I gave in to every persuasive argument, I'd be in some crazy three-way marriage with Maury Povich and Connie Chung !
Fine.
Come on, Jack.
We're outta here.
I mean, if Karen's not gonna take my help, then I'm done.
Let her live in her limo.
A lotta people a lot worse off than that.
In Russia, entire families live in their limousines.
Good God, Grace.
I beg you to pick up a newspaper.
I can't believe you're taking Sarah's office.
She's like the office grandmother.
You're taking Bubby's office.
Hey, as long as there's been offices, there's been office politics.
In fact, that's why they built offices.
So office politics would have a place to play out.
Everybody gets it.
Nobody takes it personally.
- Will ?
- Oh, hey, Gary.
Look, lemme show you that birthday card I got for Kelly.
On the outside is a word balloon that says "Happy birthday from the bunch of us".
And on the inside, bananas are talking.
Clever.
But we don't need your card, Will.
We bought our own.
- Oh, you did ?
Okay, I'll sign it.
- No, we don't want your signature.
In fact, here's your $4.50 back.
The Gap gift certificate ?
It's just from us.
$4.50 each ?
Wow, that's like 18 bucks.
Happy birthday, Kelly.
Knock yourself out at the irregular T-shirt table.
- You guys mad at me ?
- What do you think, Will ?
You got Sarah fired.
She was like a grandmother to me.
Well, now you can visit her twice a year like you do your real grandmother.
I got that office because I'm good at my job.
No, you got that office because you kissed Stein's ass.
That is not true.
Stein treats me the same way he treats anybody else in this firm.
Oh, Will, I'm clearing out that office next to yours so your assistant won't be so cramped.
- But that's Gary's office.
- Yes.
Oh, Gary, I need to speak to you later.
Enjoy your lunch.
- Hey.
- Hey, G. Where you been ?
Well, I thought I saw Karen's limo down the street, so I thought I'd try one more time to talk some sense into her, but when I opened the door, I found Mariah Carey eating ramen in her nightie.
Apparently, living in your limo isn't as weird as we thought.
Well, I couldn't just sit here, either.
I've been to every gay bar in New York.
- Looking for Karen ?
- What ?
- Will in the shower ?
- I don't know.
I just got here.
Listen, you gotta talk to that shower head.
He got a little fresh.
I had to put him in his place.
Well my place.
Karen, what are you doing here ?
Did they tow your house ?
Or did someone decide to let her friends help her ?
What ?
Your face is pulled too tight.
I don't need any help.
Come on, Karen.
Stop pretending.
You're lonely, you're down and out, and you need us.
So don't let your stupid pride get in the way of you asking for help that you obviously need.
Amen.
Okay.
You got me.
You're right again, Jack.
Sorry I was so stubborn.
I do wanna stay here.
In fact, there's nowhere I would rather be than here.
With my two best friends.
Lady Stan caved !
Our money came in !
Adios, suckers !
I'll be at the Palace Hotel !
Oh, you kids wanna come with ?
I hear there's a gym with an Olympic-sized lifeguard.
Honey ?
- Free porn.
- Grabbin' my coat.
There you go, sir, just like you like it.
Now, just You can take it from here, right ?
I don't have to make a little airplane and fly it into your mouth, do I ?
No, Will.
I'm not a child.
Am I ?
Mr. Stein, I, uh, I have something difficult to say.
Is it "Annie hit Frannie on the fanny with a flounder" ?
Yes.
Yes, and thank you for saying it.
Now I don't have to.
One more thing It's not that I don't appreciate all you've done for me, but I just have the feeling that our You're dumping me.
I can't dump you, sir.
We're not a couple.
That's exactly what you'd say if you were dumping me.
Hey !
This fish is raw !
Mr. Stein.
Calm down.
All I'm saying is it's clearly unhealthy for you to rely on me Please.
Please.
Is it the office ?
You can have mine.
I'll fire me.
Stein, you're fired.
You can't do that I just did !
But my wife and children I don't give a crap about your wife and children.
- Mr. Stein, stop.
- Its not fair.
- Fair has nothing to do w - I hate when you guys fight.
Please.
I need you.
You don't need me.
You're a legend.
You're the man that saved the lead-based paint industry a $100-million lawsuit.
- I used to be kinda tough.
- "Kinda tough" ?
You obliterated those third-graders on the witness stand.
Well, I pretty much let them hang themselves.
Don't you be so modest.
You're a killer.
You're a shark.
You're Stein.
Say it.
It.
No, say say "I'm Stein".
- Louder.
"I'm Stein".
- Louder.
I'm Stein !
Like you mean it, "I'm Stein !
" - I'm Stein !
- One more time !
I am Stein !
Now get outta here !
This is my building !
Why aren't you working ?
What am I paying you You !
Get that edamame off your desk.
Man.
Very good, sir.
Very, very savage.
This people will think twice about ever going into a Japanese restaurant again.
- You did it again.
- You saved me.
Will, I wanna thank you from the heart of my bottom.
No.
Wait.
Strike that.
Reverse it.
All right.
Get the check.
What do you mean, "Get the check" ?
I paid last time.
You didn't pay last time.
What are you talking about ?
What do you mean ?
What are you talking about ?
Listen to you guys.
What are you arguing about ?
- You just call out my name - And you know wherever I am I'll come running.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh.
Sorry.
You're still doing it.

{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Hey.
Let me ask you something.
Am I too old for this shirt ?
- No.
- Truth.
Yes.
Really ?
Some young gym-trash were whispering about me during spin class.
But I think it kind of makes me look like an Abercrombie & Fitch model.
Yeah, maybe from when they founded the company.
Great.
Where are we supposed to shop now ?
The Big-and-Tall & Old-and-Gay store ?
Might as well get fat too.
Let's eat.
Can't.
I'm savin' my appetite for tomorrow.
Leo and I are going to that all-you-can-eat brunch at The Plaza.
Wow, you guys must be pretty serious, if you're allowing him to see you in any sort of all-you-can-eat context.
Next thing you know, you'll meet his parents.
He's already floated going to Atlanta for Thanksgiving.
I put a kibosh on that, but quick.
I've already fooled him into liking me.
I don't know if I have the energy to fool two older, wiser people who I can't confuse by having sex with.
My friends, it's finally happened.
My fame has reached a new level.
I just got recognized on the street.
Jack, someone yelling "queer" from a passing car is not a fan.
You didn't hear the way they said it, my friend.
Oh, Will, someone was asking about you in the elevator.
Yeah, it was your youth, and it wants its shirt back.
Anyway, little reminder.
My acting class showcase is tonight.
It's gonna be very fun, very cas.
Very smokey, very B.O. Ah, Jack, I already have plans with Leo tonight.
I'm sorry.
I won't be able to make it.
Oh, Jack.
I have no plans tonight.
I'm sorry, I will be able to make it.
Poodle, I am planning my entire weekend around it.
Tonight I'm at your showcase, laughing and crying.
Tomorrow I'm at Dermy's, pumping my face full of enough Botox to erase any sign that I ever laughed or cried.
Sundays I go to worship at St. Patty's.
Or the Rusty Nail, whichever has happy hour.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 7 The Needle and Omelet's Done sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hey, sorry I'm late.
Is it over ?
Did I miss anything ?
- No.
- Damn it.
Welcome to Scene Study Night.
If I had known 50 years ago that I would be working with young actors like these, I woulda hanged myself.
Oh, who's up ?
Oh, crap.
Jack McFarland, get up here.
Thank you, Zandra.
I've chosen a classical piece.
But I believe it still speaks to us today.
Hi, Karen.
Hi, Will.
At first, I was afraid.
I was petrified.
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side, but then I spent so many nights just thinking how you did me wrong !
- And I grew strong !
- Stop !
Stop !
Stop !
What in the hell is this, bitch ?
Well, wha what do you mean ?
I'm acting.
Oh, is that what that smell is ?
You stink.
I've been studying with you for five years, so maybe if I stink, it's because you stink.
Do you think you could do better than me ?
Well, be my guest !
People Mr. McFarland will be teaching your classes tomorrow.
Those of you who are lucky will die in your sleep.
Oh, my god, this is so exciting.
I'll see everyone tomorrow promptly at ten-ish, okay ?
Oh, uh, boys in tight T-shirts.
Uh, girls' attendance, optional.
Oh, my God, you guys.
Did you hear that ?
Zandra wants me to teach.
I'm gonna be her prote-gay !
There goes our little Jackie, all excited.
The man stares humiliation in the face and says, "Don't I know you "?
Listen, Karen, um, let me ask you No !
I'm not Grace.
I'm not gonna go to some gay piano bar with you and sing crappy show tunes, while we slug back dirty marti's and make out.
Well, I had to ask.
Actually, no, I was just curious.
What did you say you were doing tomorrow ?
Honey, I already told you.
I'm gonna get some Botox, and then I'm Why, Wilma !
Does my little 'mo wanna get a little bo ?
Not really.
I just I may be a little bo-curious.
Well, come on, honey.
I know a cute little piano bar right around the corner.
Yeah, we'll have some dirty marti's and talk about it.
And if we make out, so be it.
The key to a successful brunch strategy is knowing how to work the buffet.
See, they put all the cheap stuff, like scones and muffins, in front.
I mean, how many of those can you have ?
Eight ?
Ten ?
That's like four bucks.
Meanwhile, the smoked fishes and other pricey items are around the corner.
What do you have, a map ?
I cased the joint last week.
You're an interesting girlfriend, Grace.
Oh, that melon looks good.
I'm might get some of that.
Melon ?
Have you not heard a word I said ?
After this round, we hit the crab cakes, and we hit them hard.
By the way, some friends of mine might meet us here today.
It's a college professor and his wife.
You don't mind if they join us, do you ?
Well, do I have to button my pants ?
I told you in the cab, no.
We need m-more mimosas.
- Hey, stranger.
How are you ?
- Good.
Grace, this is Jay and Eleanor.
Guys, Grace Adler.
Nice to meet you.
Will you explain to this lunatic that they did not move the George Washington Bridge.
Well, yelling "turn here, jackass, turn here" doesn't help me find the exit, darling.
Please, sit.
We just ordered mimosas, which I believe is French for "I don't wanna wait till noon to get hammered".
Wow.
I can't believe these before-and-after pictures.
Look at this one.
Before, she's this gnarled old witch and then after, she looks like Pleasant office.
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Walker.
You know, you come in here so often, I should really give you one of those little cards so, after 12, you get a free one.
Oh, Doc, too bad your comedy is lost on people with dead faces.
And you must be Mr. Truman.
Is this your first time ?
Yeah.
I'm a little nervous, so if you can kinda ease me into the whole process I guess we're just gonna start Boy, you really don't believe in All right.
I think we're done.
You okay ?
Yeah, as long as I can pull off a sleeveless Abercrombie & Fitch T-shirt.
So, Mrs. Walker, the usual ?
Oh, no, honey.
Mommy's got a deep one today.
Break out the crap you're testin' on rats and pigs.
Whoa, 75 bucks for brunch ?
Does a hooker come with that ?
But I guess you doctors are not worried about that.
Hey.
Come on, you're a doctor too.
Sure, it's of art history, - but that's almost like helping people.
- God bless you for doing that.
To be honest, I'm not really a big fan of the museum.
The Louvre I went through that sucker in a half hour at a dead run.
Give me the "Pet Psychic" any day of the week.
Is that, uh, some sort of a cartoon where a dog can read minds ?
What, do you live under a rock ?
Okay, wait, I don't want to oversell this.
It is the greatest TV show ever !
Well, we don't watch television.
Oh, God.
That's a load of crap, and you know it.
I prefer the theater.
No one likes the theater.
It's just an expensive nap.
You hear that, honey ?
Those five books I wrote were about a nap.
Wait a minute.
Maybe that's why I felt so refreshed after reading all of them.
You know, you are a weisenheimer.
Come on, Jay.
Let's get some food.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That vanilla yogurt looked good.
Yogurt.
Dumb ass.
They were nice.
Yeah, yeah.
I knew you'd like them.
See, it wasn't so bad meeting my parents, was it ?
No.
What ?
They're your parents ?
You invite your parents, and you don't tell me they're your parents ?
Well, it's it's just that they're not my parents.
- They're not ?
Why did you say that - They're my parents.
Leo !
Why are you looking at the waiter ?
- What is he, your brother ?
- He he is my brother.
- He's your brother ?
- He's not my brother.
You really should not be screwing around with me right now.
You lied to me.
I know how freaked out you get when I talk about my parents.
- I was trying to protect you.
- But you didn't protect me.
I looked like an idiot.
No, you didn't.
You looked like the real you, Grace.
So, so the real me is an idiot ?
I didn't say that.
You said you're an idiot.
Oh, so you think I think I think I'm an idiot.
I- I-I-I I-I think I think that you You're pretty ?
Leo, I didn't want your parents to meet the real me.
I wanted them to meet the phony me, the better me, not the one who boos your mother.
Oh, my God, I booed your mother.
That was awesome !
Come on.
You should be thanking me.
I- I just mentioned going to Atlanta for thanksgiving, and you fake a panic attack.
How dare you ?
I did not fake a panic attack.
I don't fake any Hi !
Oh, honeydew, sweet like "Sweet Charity," which is a play about a hooker.
Okay, let's begin.
Uh, Joanne, you have an audition this afternoon.
Tell us about it.
Well, it's a PSA.
Okay, for those of you who do not know, PSA stands for sexually transmitted disease.
I play this woman who's just had a baby.
And her child will never know his grandfather because he died of lung cancer from smoking.
Ooh, ouch.
Wow.
I'm gonna need a minute with that one.
Well, I guess I didn't need a whole minute, okay.
Let's go on.
Come on up.
And, Joanne, action.
It should have been the happiest day of my life.
We're stopping.
What's this, honey ?
What's this mess here ?
What's the water coming from here ?
What's that ?
I'm crying because my kid's never gonna meet his grandfather Hm-mm, but when you cry you're ugly, sweetheart.
Well, I'd like to be pretty, but cancer is sad.
And Libras are playful.
They say acting is reacting.
I say acting is attracting.
Are you attractive enough ?
I see a lot of puzzled faces.
But not many attractive ones.
But I prepared.
I spent a day with a woman who lost who father to cancer.
I can't help you get that time back, sweetheart.
But I can help you get this part.
what's happening is you're too hung up on what's in here.
The audience, they can't see that.
They can only see what's in here, okay.
Act from here, honey.
Act from your hair.
All right ?
But not that hair.
Get some highlights, take those teeth a few shades up, and, hello, Joanne, beautiful breasts.
How 'bout can we see them ?
You're an idiot !
Or am I brilliant ?
Russell, come on up here.
Take your shirt off.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is acting.
Gray skies are gonna clear up.
- Put on a happy face.
- I can't !
Brush off the clouds and cheer up.
- Put on a happy face.
- I am !
Oh, life's a party with a face full of poison.
My face hasn't been this immobilized since they bought me a lap dance at my brother's bachelor party.
You know, in the early days, we didn't always have it easy, like you.
No.
We had to go down to Chinatown, where they'd inject our frown lines with mayonnaise that had been left out in the sun for a week.
Well, we certainly owe a lot to you pioneers.
Oh, I'm gonna go put on my Abercrombie shirt.
Wow, look at me.
This is really working.
Nothing's moving.
Welcome to the wax museum, honey.
Where nothing ever moves, and people are always amazed at how life-like you look.
Honey, what's the matter ?
I d I don't look like me.
And when I said, I ran through the Louvre, it was only because I was so inspired, I had to run back to my hotel to paint.
- You don't have to do this, Grace.
- Do what ?
I'm not doing anything.
What're you doing ?
That's the bigger question.
Theater, do you spell that with an R-E or an E-R ?
I don't mean "ER," the TV program.
- I don't watch television, either.
- Grace, really.
You can cut it out.
You cut it out.
You're the doctor.
Or are you ?
I don't know.
What is she talking about ?
I didn't tell her that you were my parents.
I just said that we were old friends.
That's right.
He lied.
Just like the boy in that play who lies all the time - Help me out here, Eleanor.
- Uh, Pinocchio ?
Yeah, Pinocchio.
Your son's a Pinocchio.
Is this true, Leo ?
Did we raise a Pinocchio ?
- I think you did.
- Okay, okay, I get it.
I screwed up.
I shouldn't have lied.
You see, this is a big deal to me.
I love you, Grace.
I'm introducing you to my parents.
I just want everything to be perfect.
Because I think you're perfect, and if I-I-I Agh !
If I were replacing an aortic valve, I could do it with my eyes closed.
But this this is delicate !
It's it's brunch !
I think we should let them have a moment alone.
Come on, Jay.
Go pay.
For everyone ?
Look, I don't know what you want me to say.
I'm sorry, okay ?
- What ?
- What you said.
You love me.
That was the first time you said that.
Yeah, I was gonna say it earlier.
I was just looking for the perfect time, which was before you called my dad a "dumb ass".
You know what ?
I love you too.
So We did the I-love-you thing.
We did.
- And it felt nice.
- Yeah.
But if you ever lie to me again, they're gonna have to stitch your 'nads back together.
- Oh, Leo, your parents are still here.
- They're not my parents.
Ow-kay.
She's serious.
Thank you.
Great scene.
Finally, somebody makes Death of a Salesman watchable.
How did that feel ?
Okay, I just I don't remember there being a kiss between the brothers.
That's the difference between acting the play and Jack-ting the play.
Well, McFarland.
I gave you a class of crap, and you managed to make crap-ade.
I does what I can.
Would you please, please get the hell out of here.
Just get out.
You can't act.
You can't teach.
You got nothing to offer.
- And you never will.
- That's not true.
I did everything Jack said, and this afternoon, I got my first job.
The anti-smoking thing ?
No, I didn't get that one, because I seemed too jazzed about my dead dad.
The same casting director liked my smile and put me in a toothpaste commercial.
Even better.
You see.
She's actually helping people.
She's transformed from an actress into an attractress.
Get out.
- Zandra, what are you saying ?
- Get out !
Are you saying you want me to get out ?
Does anyone have some boiling soup ?
I don't think I like your tone.
I am a good teacher.
And if you don't want me in your class anymore, Zandra - I'll start my own.
Who's with me ?
- I am.
So am I !
And do you know why they're coming with me, Zandra ?
Because I touched people in this class today.
And when no one was looking, I touched myself a little bit too.
- Hey.
- Hey.
The most amazing thing happened to me tonight.
Leo told me that he loved me.
Oh, honey.
I'm so happy for you.
Really ?
'Cause you don't look happy.
- Trust me.
I'm thrilled.
- Will, are you really doing this ?
Are you still pouting about me and Leo, because, you know, it is so childish.
- No, I'm really happy for you.
- Unbelievable.
- Let me know when you grow up.
- Grace, I'm happy.
I'm happy !
Now I'm sad.

{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You know, I think fall is finally here.
I just saw the first drunk of the season turn yellow and tumble gently to the ground.
I tripped, okay ?
What is with a picnic in November anyway ?
I'm freezing my perfect peach off.
OOh, yeah.
This is it.
This is perfect.
Right here.
And, Jack, take off that hat.
It makes you look like a woman.
Oh, it wasn't the hat.
- Why are we doing this ?
- Come on.
It's sunny.
It's New Yorky.
I read this thing in "O", the Oprah magazine on tapas picnics, - and I've been dying to try one.
- Oprah can be a lot of fun.
And there's no one I'd rather have watching my back in a bar fight.
Hey, guys.
Sorry we're late.
We grabbed a couple hot dogs.
- I told you I was making tapas.
- I know.
Oh Leo.
I don't know if we have enough food for five people.
That's okay.
Grace just ate enough hot dogs for five people.
Honey, you got a lump under that arm.
You might wanna have that looked at.
Come on.
It's November in the park.
I thought we'd, you know, toss around a football.
Um, look, Leo.
I know you're new here.
And, um, we don't want you to think we're really cliquey and don't let anyone in our little group.
But, um, well we're really cliquey.
We don't want anyone in our little group, so So, if you wanna break into the fag four, this symbol of gay oppression has to go.
Come on, Jackie.
Get rid of it.
Who knew I could do that ?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Prepare yourselves for the finest feast this side of Barcelona.
My gift to you.
Enjoy.
It's a boomerang.
It went around the world.
My platanas bravas ruined, splattered all over this cashmere throw, and look at these broken ramekins.
You're a trip, Will.
Oh, sweetie.
It's probably going to take a while to clean up.
We're gonna go make out.
Holy cripes.
Am I outside ?
Hey, kid, can you tell us what's going on here ?
Did you just call me kid ?
- You're Katie Couric.
I love you !
- Well, thank you.
I'm sure if we spent more time together, I'd love you too.
So, uh, what is going on here ?
Talking with Katie.
We're just having this mass wedding.
Some stupid stunt for sweeps.
Well, if you're here, where in the world is Matt Lauer ?
Laughin' with Katie.
Yeah, I asked myself the same damn question when they told me I had to work on a Sunday, as if being cute and perky five days a week isn't enough hard enough.
I hear that.
Hey, you two look happy.
Would you like to get married today ?
Sure.
Yeah, why not ?
What do you say ?
Yeah, why not ?
We'll help the ratings.
Would you excuse us, Katie Couric ?
What are you doing ?
I'm serious.
We met in the park.
Let's get married in the park.
But this is just I mean, we're talking about We've only known each other, like, two months.
Grace.
Come on, you know we're gonna do it eventually.
You know what ?
I'm doing this all wrong.
Grace Adler, I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
So here, today, right now, in front of God and Katie Couric, I'm asking you Will you marry me ?
Yes.
Yes, I will.
Let's do it.
This is just a temporary ring, right ?
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 8 Marry Me A Little  sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ That was a disaster.
Tapas in the park.
That's the last time I cook something out of a magazine.
Ooh, "Gourmet" has a special on savory pies of Edinburgh.
Save your appetites, lassies !
Hey, what happened to Grace and that foreign fellow she's been hangin' around with ?
Maybe they went to the Guggenheim.
That's a real place, right ?
- What happened to you guys ?
- Are you gonna tell them or shall I ?
Well, if you don't mind, I kinda want to.
- Okay.
Go ahead.
- Okay.
We met Katie Couric !
No, no.
That's not the news.
We got married !
What ?
Just now, in the park.
- What ?
- There was this mass wedding.
What ?
Leo made me a ring out of a dandelion.
He asked.
I said yes.
I threw a pretzel bouquet.
A duck caught it.
It was all just so romantic.
And we're married.
Oh, my god, Grace !
Look who penetrated the inner circle.
And then he stuck around and married her.
Don't get too comfy.
You may have Penelope Cruzed your way in, but you can just as easily be Mimi Rogered out.
Huh ?
Hey.
What do you think ?
Wow.
What a surprise.
That's crazy.
Just spring it on us like that.
That's that's great.
- Leo, great.
- Thanks.
And, Grace best of luck.
"Best of luck" ?
Well, thanks for coming to my bat mitzvah, Uncle Hachem.
Have a safe drive to back to Syosset.
I don't know what half those words meant.
Um, what's going on ?
What ?
Nothing.
I'm happy for you.
You know, it's the biggest moment of your life.
Why would you include me ?
I-I don't matter.
I'm nothing.
Best of luck.
That is so freakin' lame !
You listen to me, Will Truman.
I know that this is sudden and not the way we thought it was gonna be, but you are my best friend, and you will be thrilled for me.
- Would you You're hurting me !
- It's about me !
I'm the bride !
- I'm the bride !
- Take it easy.
Whoa, hey.
- You hear me ?
- Take it easy.
Don't break him.
I still need him for the 20% of you I can't handle.
Hey, uh, help me out, guys.
Come on, Grace.
You're married !
Let's celebrate by throwing away most of your clothes.
I don't need to throw away my clothes.
What about the whorey-lookin' stuff you use to pick up guys ?
Let's go.
- Will, are you okay, man ?
- I'm fine.
I just wish if Grace was going to finish the Hershey syrup, that she wouldn't put the empty can back in the refrigerator !
I'm the bride !
Will, I know you feel left out.
Would it help to know that right before we got married, Grace said "I really wish Will were here "?
And I said "Me too "?
- Really ?
- I just asked, would it help ?
Cutting the tension with cruelty.
How thoughtful of you.
I'm sorry.
I know you and Grace have been friends forever.
And I just come and whisk her away like that.
- It's gotta hurt.
- It does.
Look, I know that I-I-I put out this tough-guy image.
I know people think of me as all hard and strong and macho-y.
Look at this flower arrangement, it's atrocious.
The truth is, it does hurt.
I'm never going to have a wedding of my own and I being a part of Grace's was important to me.
What are you talking about ?
You you can have a wedding.
Oh, please !
Gay weddings ?
Some witchy lesbian waves a stick over you on a beach somewhere.
While a drag queen sings "Evergreen".
I'm talking about a traditional wedding.
Grace and I used to stay up nights talking about what hers would be like.
I didn't have a hell of a lot going on at the time.
I-I I'd have this beautiful tux, big through here and small through here.
She'd have a gorgeous gown.
Small through here and big through here.
At the reception, I-I'd make a great toast.
And everybody would laugh at the right places and cry in the right places.
And then we'd do this great dance that we'd tell everybody we hadn't worked on, but secretly we had.
We can still do all that.
- I- I didn't know you were - I mean it may not be the first dance, but it could be the second.
Are you talking about a wedding reception ?
'Cause I'd really be into that.
You guys would do that for me ?
No, not just Yeah.
Just for you, all for you.
I am going to be so beautiful.
It's almost time for my toast, so give me a really good introduction, okay ?
Okay, I got it.
It should not include the words "bald," "fat," or "impotent.
" Okay, give me five minutes.
Give it to me, Change it up.
This all happened so fast.
I don't even know from Leo.
I'm not sure I approve.
- He's a Jewish doctor.
- Ooh, I love him !
Don't cock it up.
Congratulations, Leo.
We're so happy for you guys.
Hey, thanks.
We're just a bunch of old married folks now.
Well, you are.
Our marriage isn't recognized by the State of New York.
Honey.
You wanna dance ?
Well, let's see about that, Rob.
I'm carrying a boulder on my groin, and my feet have swollen twice their natural size.
Yeah.
Let's cut a rug, honey.
Rosie, how come we've never gotten together ?
Lady, quit trying to unhook my bra.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me !
Hi.
Now it's time to toast the lovely couple.
And who better to start things off than the most important person in Grace's life.
Her friend, her confidant.
And it pains me to admit this, but the most gorgeous man I know.
Ladies and gentlemen, lease welcome to the stage, me !
Grace.
Leo.
What can I say about you two beautiful kids ?
Except Acting is a craft which has been around for literally many, many years.
And I should know.
I'm Jack McFarland, creator of the McFarland Method, which has helped countless aspiring actors, actresses, and act-transgender individuals There's some very interesting people here.
Just wait, mom.
Now let's hear from another very important person in Grace's life.
One who has been there for her through sick and sin.
A great man, ladies and gentlemen Karen Walker.
Thank you.
Grace, Leon.
This is truly a wonderful evening.
See, folks.
Some people do buy the cow.
How 'bout that ?
Thanks.
Well, I am so, so happy for you both.
Thank you, everyone.
Man, there are a lot of Jews here.
Thank you.
Well, I guess that's everyone.
So thank you for coming.
Enjoy your m Hi.
I remember the first time I met Grace.
It was freshman year at Columbia.
And I was pretty much like any other college guy.
I lived in the dorm with the bare essentials futon, stereo, cast iron enamel fondue pot.
Anyway, one night I was making up a batch for myself and my roommate Rob.
I am not gay, everyone !
Do you hear that ?
I love the ladies.
I'm a breast man.
So, um, the chocolate was just coming to a gentle boil, when this creature appeared at my door sniffing.
I looked at her.
She looked at the chocolate, and the two of them have been together ever since.
I joke a lot about Grace, but well, truth is I couldn't be happier for her today.
Leo I was the first man to ask her to marry me.
And I know you're going to be the last.
To you guys.
Larry, you should get up and say something.
They spoke at our wedding.
That was a gay wedding.
It didn't really count.
- That joke isn't funny anymore.
- It is to me.
Hi.
This reminds me of something my grandfather once said : "Where's that Jamaican woman who feeds me "?
I'm not very good at this.
But someone who was, was Lord Byron, so I stole this from him.
"The light of love, the purity of grace.
The mind, the music breathing from her face, the heart whose softness harmonized the whole.
That eye was in itself a soul".
To my wife.
Thank you.
You know, I'm feeling so many things right now, it's hard to put them into words.
So I thought I would express myself in a different way.
Please don't let this feeling end it might not come again and I want to remember - Salads are out !
- What ?
Oh, I don't I don't see salad.
Oh, they're coming.
Right, everybody ?
I'll have one of those.
Thank you.
- What was that ?
- I was just taking a mini quiche.
I know what you were doing !
You were checking out that hussy.
Well, let me tell you something, boy.
Now that you're married, the only mini quiches you should be paying attention to are Grace's.
You're a little bit scary, aren't you ?
Listen to me, mister.
If I hear that you have hurt my Gracie in any way, I will hurt you, yeah.
I have people.
I'm not gonna say who.
But I do.
Hello.
Leo !
Time to cut the cake.
Okay, everyone !
Come on up.
Okay, you are the doctor.
- I will follow your lead.
- Okay, I'm not a doctor.
I just said that so you'd marry me.
- Well, he's kidding.
- He better be.
You want some - Oh, you wa - No, no, no, that's fine.
Where are you kids going on your honeymoon ?
We haven't really talked about it yet.
You should take her to your cabin.
- You have a cabin ?
- Yeah, I go there to fish.
- You fish ?
- I learned in Africa.
You were in Africa ?
Yeah, when I was with Doctors Without Borders.
You were with Doctors Without Borders ?
Have you two met ?
Let's give the newlyweds a break here.
I'm sure they know all the important stuff.
Like favorite song.
Favorite movie.
Birthdays ?
No ?
Doesn't matter.
Don't worry, Grace.
Marvin will fill you in on all that stuff.
That's right, Eleanor.
Who's Marvin ?
That'd be me.
- Your name is Marvin ?
- Yeah, yeah.
People always call me "Leo" 'cause my name's Marvin.
You just married a guy, and you don't even know his name ?
Silly.
- I don't know your name ?
- Come on, my first wife didn't have a problem with that.
You were married before ?
Wrong time to try that joke.
Are you okay, baby ?
Um, no, I'm Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I knew she'd cock it up.

Previously on Will and Grace Hey, kid, can you tell us what's going on here ?
Did you just call me kid ?
You're Katie Couric.
So, uh, what is going on here ?
We're just having this mass wedding.
Some stupid stunt for sweeps.
Oh, if you're here where in the world is Matt Lauer ?
Hey, you two look happy.
Would you like to get married today ?
We got married !
What ?
Just now, in the park.

Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 9 Marry Me A Little More  sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Where are you going ?
You're blowin' this way out of proportion.
You're like a stranger to me Marvin.
I might as well have married my Israeli pen pal from when I was 15 who sent me love letters on Hello Kitty stationary.
Actually over there it'd be Shalom Kitty.
Please don't joke right now.
That was weird up there.
I don't even know when your birthday is.
Okay, you wanna know some stuff about me ?
Here you go.
I believe when I hold my breath, the guy on TV's going to make the basket.
I'm in a Doors cover band, consisting entirely of surgeons called "The Operating Room Doors".
And my deepest, darkest secret is that I don't like any food with raisins in it, but I do like raisins.
See, we already have a problem.
I love raisins.
In everything !
I even went to see A Raisin in the Sun because I thought there'd be raisins in it.
Grace, we have a whole lifetime to get to know each other, baby.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I just wish that there was some way that we could be sure we were doing the right thing, you know.
Just a sign, something.
Katie ?
Hi !
Crap.
Hi !
Thanks for watching !
- Do you have your own pens ?
- No, no, no.
It's Grace and Leo.
Remember, from the other day in the park.
We got married because of you.
Actually I got a colonoscopy because of you too.
Not on the same day, though.
And not in the park.
- Eee, the wedding.
Sorry about that.
- What ?
What do you mean ?
No one called you ?
Ooh, awkward.
We're scrapping the whole wedding segment, because the judge performing the ceremony wasn't licensed in New York.
So all those marriages are invalid.
Last time I use Tom Brokaw's nephew as my fact checker.
I guess I wanted a sign, and I think I got it.
We're not married.
We'll go to city hall tomorrow.
We'll do it all over again.
- I don't know that I can.
- Why ?
Why not ?
- What's changed ?
- Everything has changed.
I mean, the first time I said yes, it was impulsive and romantic and to a guy named Leo.
And now We know nothing about each other.
I knew everything I needed to know about you the first time I held your hand.
Grace, we're already married.
The rest is paperwork.
- How can you be so sure ?
- Because when it's right, you just know.
You remember Tuesday ?
We woke up.
I said, "Morning, wife".
You said, "Hello, husband".
Remember that ?
Remember how great that was ?
I want every day to be Tuesday.
Every day can't be Tuesday.
Today's Saturday, so it can't be Tuesday.
Monday can't be Tuesday.
Tuesday can't Well, Tuesday can, but Wednesday definitely can't be Tues Just come up with me.
And I promise you everything is going to be fine.
Please.
I can't.
I need time.
I'm sorry.
That was wild, wasn't it, Jackie ?
The way Grace just kind of spooked and ran off.
Kind of like Rosie whenever I fire my gun in her room just as she's falling asleep.
Um, hi, everyone.
I have a little bit of an announcement to make.
Grace and I ran into Katie Couric in the lobby And she said that we weren't really married.
Turns out the judge that married us wasn't really legit, so Anyway, we have this place till midnight, so stick around, you know.
There's cake, there's booze, there's dancing.
Well, have fun.
I'm sorry.
You okay ?
I'm about as good as Bill Buckner of the '86 Red Sox.
Ooh, ouch.
I'm sorry.
Do you even know what that means ?
No, but anybody that's got 43 pairs of red socks obviously had issues.
- Where's Grace ?
- She took off.
She she was pretty freaked out.
Can I borrow your phone, man ?
I think I need to call her.
Uh, Leo, I think you might wanna give her some time right now.
I know Grace.
She's not like you.
She's not impulsive.
She once bought Impulse perfume and then returned it.
That's why this whole getting married in the park thing all seemed so weird to me.
Yeah, well, I guess I should send everyone home.
Hi, it's me again.
Listen, you're not going to like what you're about to hear.
To be fair, he did say we wouldn't like what we were about to hear.
- I thought you needed time to think.
- I did.
And I realized I want today to be Tuesday.
It's Tuesday ?
How long have I been out ?
Okay.
So our first wedding didn't take.
But we're havin' another one !
And a real one this time.
As for all these, ah, these lovely presents, I don't really know the protocol.
Let's just call them engagement gifts.
Bring another one at the wedding.
Welcome to the wedding.
Don't forget to sign the guest book.
Okay, who wrote, "If it doesn't work out, call me".
That's tacky.
Don't forget to sign the guest book.
Oh, perfect.
I've been looking for this.
- That's a little inappropriate !
- Please.
This is inappropriate ?
How about inviting people to watch a man and woman get married ?
Look how good it makes my shoulders look.
Well, Will.
Congratulations.
I think you've done a fantastic job at planning this wedding.
I take my pants off to you.
You've gotta be kidding me.
The photographer's late.
Four people who RSVP'd "no" just arrived with dates.
And the cake shows up with two grooms on it.
Is the whole city gay ?
Not yet.
But if all goes as planned, come Monday morning And look at these boutonnieres.
Dead.
- They're fine.
- They're dead, my friend.
Hey, hey, hey !
Sign that guest book !
Lady, you're a wreck !
But it's understandable.
Today's a big day for you.
You're not just losing a best friend, you're also losing a hag.
She's not my hag, okay ?
She's the most important person in my life, who used to be in love with me, and who for the last 15 years has never left my side.
She's been a hell of a hag.
- Hey, Will.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Are you okay ?
- Sure, why wouldn't I be ?
'Cause you're losing your girl.
You're single again.
Boy, I miss those days That can be arranged !
I'm joking !
I was joking.
But if you know anyone.
Knock, knock !
Oh, I'm here to see the daughter of the mother of the bride.
Come on in, mom, for one minute.
Now, Grace, I don't want you to freak out, but the biggest day of your life is ruined.
What ?
Well, your father's back went out.
And he can't move.
How is he going to walk me down the aisle ?
Dear, I don't know.
But we'll just put a pastrami sandwich and a TV Guide under the chuppah.
He'll find his way.
Honey.
Have Will walk you down the aisle.
Yeah, it'll be perfect.
Out with the 'mo, in with the Jew !
Will'll love that.
He looks so beautiful in his tux.
He's not gonna be the most beautiful one there, is he ?
Oh, honey, come on !
Don't be silly.
That's crazy talk.
I'll be there.
Ladies, I said no poems.
There he is.
How you holdin' up ?
You need a handshake ?
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Ellen, you make a beautiful bridesmaid.
Eight months pregnant Look at the dress she picks for me.
I hate that skinny bitch.
Maybe you oughta skip the guest book.
I know this is gotta be pretty hard on you.
- It's not hard on me.
- Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to really do my best to make Grace as happy as you have.
Well, plus sex.
What's the matter with everybody ?
I'm fine.
- Will ?
- I'm fine !
Grace needs you in the dressing room.
Oh, all right.
- What ?
- Come here, chica !
- You're not wearing that, are you ?
- Well, it's white.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
I didn't think I was going to be so nervous.
But I am.
I'm doing the right thing, right ?
- Well - What ?
Nothing.
No, I just I'm just saying As a friend, I want you to know that if you were thinking of calling it off, don't worry about the people out there.
Don't worry about all those gifts.
You do what your heart tells you is right.
- Are you freaking kidding me with this ?
- "If", I said "if".
The question was rhetorical.
That means you're supposed to say "yes".
- That's not what "rhetorical" means.
- Are we talking about what "rhetorical" means or about how you're freaking me out ?
Am I supposed to answer that or is that rhetorical too ?
Okay, I don't have time for this, Will.
I have to get into my dress.
Who says that ?
"Don't worry about the people, don't worry about all the gifts".
Who does that ?
An ass, that's who !
It's a screen, not a soundproof booth.
Oh, isn't that sweet ?
Will's doin' her one last time before he hands her off to Leo.
I just hope before I get married, he'll do the same for me.
Ditto.
Hey, Kar.
Can I kiss you ?
- Why ?
- Just 'cause.
Okay.
All I'm trying to say I just - Look at it from my point - Don't !
Let me tell you something, mister.
This wedding is going to happen.
You better get on board, because you've gotta walk me down the aisle.
- What ?
- My dad threw his back out.
He's bent over like he's trying to pick up a quarter, which is probably how he threw out his back to begin with.
So I need you to walk me down the aisle.
I can't do that.
I'm running this show.
I got a million things to attend to.
Get Jack to do it.
I'm not having Jack walk me down the aisle.
He'll meet someone halfway down and ditch me !
- Well, then get Karen to do it.
- Karen ?
When was the last time she could walk a straight line ?
Besides, I don't want them.
I want you !
Well, I can't do it.
All right ?
What do you mean, you can't do it ?
I need someone to give me away.
You're my best friend.
I want it to be you.
It should be you.
I don't wanna.
You don't "wanna" ?
Why not ?
- Will ?
- Look, Grace, I'll do a lot of things for you.
I'll plan your wedding.
I'll pick the florist.
I'll even let you have input on your dress.
But to actually be the one that that hands you off to another guy that I can't do.
Groom coming in.
I'm not looking.
Just wanted to make sure everything was okay in here.
People are starting to place bets.
Apparently, you've walked out on one of these before.
I didn't know about that, but that's cool.
- Look, Leo - Oh, God.
No.
No, we're getting married.
Just the thing is, Will and I need to take a little walk.
So could you just stall them, just a little bit ?
Sure, sure, yeah.
Just as long as you remember that you and I have to take a little walk as well.
I'm a little bit nervous about that track record of yours.
You're gone, aren't you ?
Okay, I guess this would be as good a time as any to tell you about that stripper at my bachelor party.
Grace, what are we doing up here ?
This is ridiculous.
There is no way you're gonna talk me into this.
Stop.
Now let me talk, okay ?
You know the story you always tell of when we first met ?
The one that you told at the reception ?
The fondue story ?
I love how you tell it.
It's a wonderful story.
Well, I am a natural storyteller.
- Yeah.
Too bad it's crap.
- What ?
That was the second time we met.
The first time was right here, on this roof, at Nancy Jacob's party.
Nancy Ja No, no.
- That was across from a juice bar.
- Paradise Juice.
Right over there, where that parking lot is.
Oh, typical.
They pave Paradise, and they put up a parking lot.
- You were here ?
- Yup.
I thought you were the cutest guy I had ever seen.
So I came up to you, and I asked for a drink.
And you were so sweet, the way you held that funnel for me.
And then I stumbled back to Nancy and I said, "That's the man I'm going to spend the rest of my life with".
Well we say things when we're young.
I said Human League would be bigger than the Beatles.
Will, I may be getting married today, but when I said I was going to spend the rest of my life with you, I wasn't wrong.
- Well, except - No.
I wasn't wrong.
- Now let's jump.
- What ?
Let's keep going, Thelma.
You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when I met you I picked you out and shook you up and turned you around, turned you into someone new Don't tell Leo I had the first dance.
Anybody lose one of these ?
Hey, a little traveling music, please.
Honey, look at him.
After all these years, Will and Grace are finally getting married.
- Am I crying yet ?
- Still no.
- How about now ?
- No.
- Stick a pin in my arm.
- I am.
Here we go.
This may be a bad time to tell you this, but I'm straight.
Don't make me laugh.
I'm being photographed.
Take good care of her.
- Okay ?
- I will.
Today we're here to celebrate the marriage of Grace Adler and Marvin Markus.
Leo.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Ok, husband, I'll be right down.
Oh, Leo.
I'm so excited.
Tonight I'm gonna sleep with a married man.
Okay, you can watch.
- Whee !
Going on my honeymoon.
- I'm happy for you.
I've also narrowed down what I'm gonna turn your room into.
It's either gonna be a home office, a gym, or a gift-wrapping room, like Candy Spelling has.
Ah, who am I kidding ?
The bows and ribbons arrive tomorrow.
This sucks.
How come Grace gets to go to the Caribbean, and I don't ?
Trust me, poodle.
You don't wanna go.
Two Jews on a beach ?
It's gonna be a week of hunting for the highest SPF at the lowest price.
You guys gonna miss me ?
- Like you even have to ask !
- Of course we're gonna miss you, crazy !
'Kay.
See you in a week.
Wow.
She's really gone.
I miss her already.
I'm sad.
- New gay bar on 72nd Street !
- Right behind ya !
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 10 The Honeymoon's Over sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ That gift-wrapping room's like the best thing ever.
I don't know how I existed without it.
I was always losing the scissors and spreading the wrapping paper out on the floor like an animal.
Yeah.
Okay And exchange.
Oh, my God !
Smart Start !
And milk.
Always the perfect gift.
It's so much more fun eating breakfast this way.
I know.
Hurry up, we've only got two hours to gift wrap lunch.
- Um, sweetheart ?
- Yes, bunny ?
I think I'm gonna need my allowance a little early this week.
Well, I thought you were doing well teaching your acting class.
'Twas.
But, um, I had to kick a student out.
Yeah.
Phillip wasn't willing to do what it takes to become a great actor.
- He wouldn't make out with you ?
- All I wanted was a little Mr. French !
He got all crazy when I told him.
Started hissing and spraying everywhere.
He even told me he was gonna sic the gay mafia on me.
Right, the gay mafia.
Or as I like to call it, really organized crime.
Yeah, what are they gonna do ?
Measure me for concrete sneaker clogs ?
They gonna make you a coiffure you can't refuse ?
I don't get that one.
Hey, Sam.
Hey, Diane.
Hey, someone's got a little spring in their step.
You just get a bikini wax ?
I don't know.
People were moving around down there I assume something was getting done.
Funny, Jack said the same thing about his last dentist appointment.
Ah listen, kids.
I need your help.
I'm in a little bit of a pickle.
You know how I'm into Aerosmith, right ?
- Yeah.
- Sure, go ahead.
I went to see 'em play at Madison Square Garden and invited 'em back to my suite at the Palace Hotel to party with me.
- Aerosmith ?
- No, Madison Square Garden.
Anyhoo Some things may have been set on fire.
A bellboy may have been stripped and shaved.
A young girl may have become a mother.
Bottom line They kicked me out.
And no hotel in New York will have me.
And I need a place to stay.
Well, you know, I'd let you bunk with me, but they're gonna be shooting "Sex and the City" in my apartment all week !
Yeah, in fact, I gotta go baby-proof it.
In case Sarah Jessica brings little James Wilke Jessica Broderick Parker.
So, I guess that leaves No, no, no.
No, you cannot stay here.
Why don't you move in with one of your hallucinations ?
All right, okay.
I see what this is gonna take.
Ooh, yeah.
It's good to be bad, isn't it, daddy ?
Whoo !
Karen, I'd ha What Okay, all right, all right.
Stop it !
You can stay here But just till we work things out with the Palace.
I don't know if you hypnotized me with those things or what, but I'm not afraid of flying anymore.
Hey.
What time does the gal come by to turn down the bed ?
Karen, this is not a hotel.
No one will be turning your bed down.
And I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't keep filling up my answering machine with complaints about room service.
Since you bring it up, when I checked in, the soaps had all been opened, and the shower cap had been used.
Karen, I am trying to catch up on some work here.
Okay ?
I've got an SEC filing that's months overdue, a product liability case that's going to trial, and, most importantly of all, the firm's annual potluck dinner is coming up, and I don't want three people bringing salads, like last year's fiasco.
Fine, I'll leave you alone.
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone.
- It's not unusual to be loved by - Karen !
Quiet !
Quiet.
Jeez Louise !
It's just a little top 40.
Well, if you must do that, put the headphones on.
Oh, fun.
If you ever want to be loved by anyone.
It's not unusual, it happens every day.
No matter what you say, you see it happens all the Where you going ?
I'm just about at the bridge.
I can't believe I sacrificed my gift-wrapping room for you.
And right around the holidays !
Morning, morning, morning.
Remember we were making those jokes about the gay mafia ?
- I think it's for real.
- Of course it is.
I'm sure some gay guy's getting whacked as we speak.
This is serious.
I think that guy I kicked out of my acting class sent them after me.
I mean, look at this.
That's awful.
What am I looking at ?
Hello ?
Dry, unmanageable hair.
I just got back from the salon, the center of gay culture.
The shampoo boy said he was gonna put conditioner in, but I think he just went like this Well, that's all the proof I need.
And check this out, check this out.
"Sex and the City", supposed to shoot all week in my apartment ?
Then for no reason They pulled out.
- What does that have to do with anyth - Do I have to spell it out ?
"Sex and the City," HBO, H-O-M-O.
- What do I do, Will ?
What do I do ?
- Okay, here's the plan.
Call Dorothy, tell her to meet you at the Yellow Brick Road.
When you get to the end of the road, you'll see a man.
Ask him for a brain.
Oh, Will, you would have loved this hotel.
They had parasailing and scuba diving.
You could go in a Jeep and scour cave walls for markings made by the indigenous peoples.
Cool.
What did you do ?
There was a bar in the pool.
I swear, swimming any other way than drunk is just stupid.
Oh, and the sunsets.
Amazing.
I took, like, seven rolls of film just on that.
You know, let's open up a bottle of wine and I'll walk you through 'em.
Hey, you open the wine, I'll open the oven door and climb in.
Hi, are you alone ?
Did anybody follow you up here ?
Uh, how about, "Welcome back from your honeymoon" ?
Yeah, whatever, who cares.
Listen, I got bigger problems, all right ?
The gay mafia's put a hit out on me.
What is a gay hit ?
"It's Raining Men" ?
This is serious !
They're everywhere.
They control everything.
Who do you think prevented that 'NSync guy from going into space ?
I gotta go.
I gotta go.
"It's not unusua it's not unusua It's not " Well, this is unusual.
What the hell happened here ?
Karen ?
Grace Adler Designs.
I don't remember giving permission for a party !
It wasn't a party.
You guys know how I'm into gangsta rap, right ?
- Sure, go on.
- All I did was invite Ol' Dirty Bastard over to watch Masterpiece Theatre.
And he brought along his whole posse.
And some bomb-ass chronic.
Heh-heh !
Would you look at this place ?
These cushions are ruined.
There's beer rings all over the coffee table.
Great, they broke my novelty pen from last year's Gay Games.
Now when you turn it, the high-diver's Speedo doesn't come off.
What am supposed to do with this pen now ?
- I have a suggestion.
- I heard that !
- All right, calm down.
- Don't you tell me to calm down !
Hey, can we please not do this in front of the D-R-U-N-K ?
- Can I have my martini now ?
- No !
No dessert !
- Will, she's hungry.
- Tough !
She's gotta learn that there are consequences to her actions !
So you are gonna sit there, on this couch, and look at Grace's honeymoon pictures !
I hate you !
Roll one.
My luggage.
Which brings us to roll three.
Getting kicked out of the first class lounge.
Oh.
Hey, Grace.
Hey, Leo.
Listen, you mind if I talk to your wife alone for a minute ?
You come to Long Island, you can talk to her any time you like.
Hey, Kare, what's up with all the luggage ?
Oh, nothing, honey.
I just came by to look at all of your honeymoon pictures.
Okay, now I know something's wrong.
What happened ?
- I don't wanna live with Will anymore.
- Why ?
He has no sense of humor.
He didn't laugh at all when that M-80 went off in his toilet.
Well, he can get like that.
So, what are you gonna do ?
Oh, no problem.
I'm just gonna move in with you.
Problem !
Hey.
Look what showed up on my doorstep.
Was she in a basket with a note pinned to her that said, "Please take care of my baby.
Love, Lucifer" ?
We've got a problem.
She needs a place to stay.
- Why can't she stay with you and Leo ?
- Come on, we're newlyweds.
We wanna be able to have sex without someone in the background giggling.
Honey, I won't giggle if you don't make that face you make.
Will, come on.
Come on, she's in a really bad way.
- You have to take her.
- I don't want her.
- Neither do I. - What are we gonna do ?
We can't just drive her out to the country and release her back into the wild.
Or can't we ?
Just think about it.
We can lure her into a cage with a Vicodin tied to the end of a little piece of string.
If her friends ask, we just say, "We took her to farm where she can run free and have waiters fired".
Come on, let's get serious.
Where's she gonna go ?
Where did she go ?
This is crazy.
We're not gonna find Karen.
She could be anywhere.
She's got four fake passports and a map of the underworld.
We've gotta keep looking for her.
She's out there all alone.
The city's full of criminals and murderers.
She could hurt one of them.
- Maybe we should call the police.
- No.
No cops.
But she's in a bad place.
We can't find her I said no cops !
I'm gonna go ask around, see if anyone's seen her.
Keep it on the down-low.
Come on.
Let's get a drink.
Make it a double.
We wanna catch Karen, we've gotta drink like her.
- Could you pass those nuts ?
- No problem.
- Jack ?
- Sorry, nope.
- Jack, we know it's you.
- No, it is not me !
My name is Claude Remains.
I have dark glasses.
I'm from Indiana.
- Look, I have a mustache.
- Not anymore.
I can't believe you just did that !
Just hand me over to the gay mafia, the homo nostra, Don Queerleone.
So that's what this is about ?
You're hiding ?
Yes, Toby's meeting me here.
He borrowed his mother's Caprice and he's gonna smuggle me to Oklahoma.
- You're going to Oklahoma ?
- Yes.
The matinee.
We're heading out.
We'll see you later ?
- No, they're after me.
- Enough of that crap !
No one's after you.
It's all in your head.
- Your fish, sir.
- But I didn't order Oh, my god !
It's a message.
I'm a dead man !
I'm gonna sleep with the fishes !
But it's the gay mafia, so I'm gonna sleep with trout almandine drizzled with lemon and capers !
I don't know where else to look for her.
We checked the Gun Club, the FDA testing center, Bill Clinton's office in Harlem She's nowhere.
- Was he checking me out ?
- No, Grace.
Oh, my God.
Look.
Karen ?
What are you doing ?
Nothing, just shooting the breeze with these three Rosarios.
Now leave me alone.
Look, we're really sorry.
I know we said some pretty harsh things.
We forget sometimes that you have human feelings.
You do, right ?
You know, you could be a little more sensitive.
This divorce hasn't exactly been easy for me.
I know.
You and Stan were together a long time.
What ?
Stan ?
Who said anything about One Ton Phooey ?
- Yours is the divorce I'm upset about.
- What ?
You two split up without even a thought as to how it would affect me.
Hey, I know she's no prize.
And I know she's no prize, either.
But couldn't you two have stayed together for my sake ?
Karen What ?
Don't you get it ?
It was always me, you, and Will.
It was ?
As long as you were together, I felt safe, taken care of, special.
I just don't know where I fit in anymore.
Karen.
No matter what happens between us, nothing could ever change the way we feel about you.
- Really ?
- Of course, Karen.
We love The way we feel about you.
So we're a family again ?
As much as we ever were.
So we're clear on this, right ?
You understand there is no gay mafia ?
There is no network of waiters and florists and cabaret singers who carry out the commands of some shadowy don.
Or, in this case, eye-shadowy don.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, whatever.
Doesn't matter, anyway.
I let Phillip back in my class because he is a talented actor and is under no obligation to make out with me.
Did you hear that ?
Phillip's back in, pass it on.
Jack !
Enough !
There is no gay mafia.
It does not exist.
I do not know this man !
We are not here together.
After you pay the check Leave me alone !
Gay mafia.
I'm surrounded by idiots.
- Oh, man !
My new Gucci suit !
- Sorry, sir.
Hey, it's not funny.
It's a little bit funny.
Oh, my God.
You're You're you.
That's right, and next time it'll be red wine.
A word of advice, Will.
Don't dismiss things you know nothing about.
And don't walk in ten-inch heels It's hell on the ankles.
What are you talking about ?
There is no such thing Isn't there ?
Well, even if there was, it's not like they control the Don't they ?
Come on.
- It's not like you're the - Aren't I ?
Listen, Will.
You're a smart boy.
You've got a good face.
A flat stomach.
I'd hate to see you banned from every gym in America.
And what ?
End up in a Fitness Protection Program ?
Don't joke.
It's real.
So watch yourself, Will.
'Cause we're watching you.
One wrong move, and this bitch will be back.
Could you give me $2.00 for the coat check girl ?
Okay, I'll ask her.
I'm on with the manager of the Palace Hotel.
They're willing to take you back, as long as you're willing to return the concierge's prosthetic leg.
No !
I won that leg fair and square.
Besides, I need it to hit the snooze button in the morning.
Why don't you just sleep on the other side of the bed ?
Hey !
All right.
Oh.
But Um tell him two of the toes broke off.
Did you hear that ?
Two of the toes broke off Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Beautiful.
Now you do me.
- Hey, Prancer.
- Hey, Vixen.
Hey, Blitzed.
Oh, good, just in time.
Can I put the star on ?
'Cause I got a really good one this year.
Now the other ornaments have something to aspire to.
Yes, look at it there.
Shining like a beacon of unemployment.
So, Wilma, now that you've gotten rid of the old ball and chain, got any Christmas Eve plans ?
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna spend the whole evening by myself.
Yeah.
I'm gonna string cranberries around the tree, get in my jammies, and watch every version of A Christmas Carol ever made.
And which one do you think you'll be watching when you kick the chair out from under you ?
Hey, there's a difference between being alone and being lonely.
I am lonely.
Honey, why don't you join Jackie and me in my suite at The Palace Hotel ?
It's gonna be a real old fashioned Christmas.
The stockings will be hung by the chimney with care.
And I'll be stinking drunk.
And then at midnight, we're going to crawl into bed and wait for the sound of hooves on the rooftop.
No, honey, Rosie's not invited.
- So what do you say ?
- And pass up my annual screening of Ebbie, starring Susan Lucci as the definitive female Scrooge ?
Yeah, I'll be there at 6:00.
Maybe we should invite Grace and Leo.
- Oh, I already invited them.
- What ?
Before me ?
No !
Come on, crazy !
After I invited you !
Merry Christmas !
Grace and Leon !
Hey, feliz navi-dude.
Hey.
We just came by to try some of your famous Christmas cookies.
Grace has been talking about 'em all week.
Oh, I don't bake those till tomorrow.
- See ya.
- Wait.
Will, we brought you something for your tree.
What ?
I thought you were against the whole tree thing 'cause you're Jewish.
Well, it's your place now.
I'm not gonna impose my beliefs on you.
Oh.
A star of David.
What ?
Who is this David ?
He's completely stolen my idea.
We got it as a wedding gift.
Next Christmas you're getting a Seder plate.
Um, Karen, you know, I know we told you a couple of weeks ago we were going to your thing at The Palace, but - A couple of weeks ago !
- After you.
But we're not gonna be able to make it 'cause we got tickets The Nutcracker.
I am so jealous !
How did you get tickets for Christmas Eve ?
I've been calling every day since June.
That information does not leave this room.
You know, it's kind of ironic, actually.
I treated a guy who took a puck to the groin during a pick-up hockey game, and he gave me two tickets to The Nutcracker.
Yeah, it'd be even more ironic if the ballet were called "Crap, Now I Can't Have Kids".
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 11 All About Christmas Eve sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Okay, you guys, are you ready ?
- On the count of three.
One - I don't know about this.
- Two - Really, guys.
Three !
Merry Christmas, New York !
That was fun !
I'm glad I put a bow on, it was a more festive message.
Hey, we got a nibble.
Some loser across the way spending Christmas in his bathrobe's checking us out.
Hey, look !
He's hot and he's waving.
Come on, let's put up our stockings before Santy gets here.
What ?
I made it myself.
My home ec teacher said I was a needlepoint prodigy.
In fact, I was the only guy to have a piece in the statewide needlepoint competition.
Well, the only guy who's still a guy.
He's here.
Santa's here !
Hey, you're not Santa Claus.
Close, though.
You got a couple of white hairs sproutin' outta your chin, and you look like you just came down the chimney.
We'd make a good team.
Your nose is so red you could guide my sleigh tonight.
- Merry Christmas, honey.
- You too, babe.
Hi, G !
Hey, Kare, come help me stretch out my stocking.
I don't want Santa to think I have small feet.
Heh heh What's going on ?
I thought you'd be on your way to The Nutcracker.
Leo got beeped.
All the Jewish doctors have to be on call for Christmas.
In other words, all the doctors have to be on call for Christmas.
So How would you like to come with me to The Nutcracker ?
I can't.
I've got plans with Jack and Karen.
Ditch 'em.
Come on.
I'm having fun.
I'm wearing a bow under here.
Come on, come on, it's The Nutcracker.
You have loved this story ever since you were a little kid.
I know.
I used to go to sleep in my suit the night before.
I'd get up the next morning and spend two hours getting my hair just right.
- How nobody knew - Okay, tick-tock.
No, I can't.
I'm having fun.
I respect them too much to do that to them.
Oh, look, I think he's coming !
I see Santa's crack !
I'll get changed.
Oh, that was intense !
What was that smell ?
That was not just B.O.
That was B-O-My-God !
What was the scent that air freshener ?
Onion and feet ?
- Hey, Will.
Hey, Grace.
- Hey, Steve.
What are you doing ?
Going to see the ballet.
I have a date.
Ooh, good for you.
It's my mom.
Oh Well, that can still be fun.
I don't think she's gonna show.
Between you and me I love my husband, but I'm glad he's not here.
I wouldn't want to spend tonight any other way.
- Grace !
- Leo !
- Hi.
What happened ?
- It turns out they just beeped me 'cause they wanted to know if they could eat the sesame noodles I left in the fridge.
I threw a big fit last time 'cause somebody ate my lemon Yoplait.
Had my name on it and everything.
- Let's go to the show.
- Yay !
Oh.
So this is weird.
Leo just showing up, and us having only two tickets.
- I suppose you want me to - Would you mind ?
No.
It's Christmas.
Consider it my gift to you.
Although you will have to give back the other gift I gave you.
I'm serious.
- Get in there.
Have fun.
- Thanks, Will.
You're a prince.
The next holiday is yours.
New Year's Well, no.
Valen Ok.
I have three words for you : you, me, Purim.
Oh, Jackie, look at all this food.
We are so blessed.
I know.
There are poor people who dream their whole lives of a meal like this.
Honey, I know what we should do.
Let's take a picture of us eating and show it to them.
Karen, you are like a female Jesus.
Oh, great, the food's here.
I'm gonna clean up, get in my robe.
Tie my boys in a bow, and I'll be ready.
What the hell are you doing here ?
What are you talking about ?
I've been here the whole time.
I thought I could have fooled one of you with that.
Leo showed up.
Is that eggnog ?
Hey, hey, Rudeness Giuliani !
You can't just use us, toss us aside, and then waltz back in here and expect us to forgive everything.
We are not sleeping together.
Yeah, take off, Mary.
There's no room at the inn.
All right, look, I shouldn't have left.
I really was having a good time.
And I want to be here now.
Please ?
Okay, we will consider letting you back in, - but you're gonna have to work for it.
- What do I have to do ?
Pleasure us !
Fast and nasty.
And extra points if you can find a way to work in that shoeshine mitt.
There isn't a mitt big enough.
Okay, option B. You must recite 'Twas the Night Before Christmas to us.
- Well, I can do that.
- But you must substitute every fifth word with the word "heinie".
And give a little kick like a Rockette.
'Twas the night before heinie And all through the heinie Not a creature was heinie Not even a mouse Heinie I love that we got hot buttered rum.
It's so Christmassy.
Yeah.
It's the perfect little $80 treat before seeing The Nutcracker.
Cheers.
What the hell is this crap ?
I know It tastes like warm rum with butter in it.
Ugh.
I'm so glad we came early so we could soak up the Christmas feeling.
I just love looking at the little kids all dressed up, sharing a special night with their family.
Peter, I swear to God.
You poke her one more time, and the next book you'll be reading is Harry Potter and the Forty-Five Minute Spanking.
- Can I have a hot buttered rum ?
- I should warn you, they're awful.
I don't care.
Hopefully, Santa can swing by Child Services.
Aw, damn it.
Sweetie, I got some bad news.
Someone's trying to break into your pants ?
No, no.
It's Mrs. Schuler.
And I gotta go because she's having kidney failure.
Christmas Eve ?
Doesn't she have two kidneys ?
One of them's given up, and the other one's living with her sister in Florida.
- You gonna be okay ?
- Yeah.
I'll meet you home later.
Okay.
I'll bring you something from the hospital.
You like gauze ?
Bye.
Hey, Grace.
You alone ?
Oh, um I think I am.
Did your mom ever show ?
Yeah.
Too bad, otherwise you and I coulda hooked up.
You do know I'm married ?
So was my ex-wife, but it didn't stop her.
Oh, I am full.
I cannot drink another bite.
I think I ate too much, too.
I'm gonna have to undo the bellhop's pants.
Now don't poop out on me, we still have to go caroling.
You gotta be kidding.
I'm stuffed.
If I open my mouth to sing, half a bird would fly out.
Honey, this is The Palace.
We don't have to go out to carol.
Come in !
Here's the ice you asked for.
Oh, yes, just put it right over here, bellman.
Good king Wenceslas looked out on the feast of Stephen When the snow lay roundabout, deep and crisp and even.
- Just the boys !
- Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel.
When a poor man came inside, Gathering winter fuel Thank you, bellman.
That'll be all.
Oh, isn't that fun ?
'S open !
- Problem with the heater ?
- Oh, yes, electrician.
The dial's on 74, but we'd like it on 73.
Just hear those Sleigh bells jingling, ding-ding-dingling too.
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling yoo-hoo !
All done !
Thanks, honey.
How 'bout that ?
You know, this is a lot like the first Christmas.
Except we did get a room, none of us are virgins, and instead of the baby Jesus, we have a plate of cheeses.
- Hello ?
- Hey.
Hey, listen, Leo got beeped again.
So great news, you get to be my date again.
- Turndown service.
- Hold on a second.
I'll get it.
- Come, they told me - pa rum pa pum pum So, can you be here in, like, ten minutes ?
'Cause they're blinking the lights.
- No, you can't keep doing this to me.
But you love The Nutcracker.
You've loved it since you were a kid.
You've been calling for tickets since June.
I said that was not to leave the room !
We're on an unsecured cell phone here.
Oh, it's The Nutcracker, Will.
Remember your childhood ?
The beautiful music, the magical story, the funny feeling you got in your pants every time the tin soldiers lifted each other ?
I do love a toy in uniform.
But, no, I can't, no.
It's snowing again.
I'll never get a cab.
Then run, Will.
Run through the snow.
Run to The Nutcracker.
Run to that stirring in your pants !
I'll be there as fast as I can.
- Uh, guys, listen.
- What ?
You're ditching us again ?
I'm sorry.
Okay, this one's gonna cost you, Wilma.
In order for us to forgive you, you'll perform the following task You must sing the "Twelve Days of Christmas".
I can do that.
As the Count, from "Sesame Street".
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me That's one, one day !
Oh, Will, you made it.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Better thank me.
It's freezing out there.
I ran past the Zoo, and two polar bears were fighting over a pashmina.
God, I love you for doing this.
And tonight is all about you and me.
- Grace !
- Leo !
- Oh, come on !
- What are you doing here ?
I got another doctor to cover for me.
You have to make out with his wife at the New Year's party and let him videotape it, but I made it.
- Will, what are you doing here ?
- I'm going to The Nutcracker.
- What are you doing here ?
- I am avoiding an awkward situation by going to go pee pee.
Well, here it comes.
Go ahead, blow me off.
You know you're gonna do it.
I can't believe you're blowing me off !
I changed my plans for you, not one time, but two times tonight.
One, two, two times.
Damn !
It's gonna be stuck in my head till New Year's.
- How could you ?
- I don't know what else to do.
Is this how it's gonna be from now on ?
When he can't make it tosomething, I'm expected to show up.
The moment he's back, I'm out ?
Will, when you say it like that, you make it sound like You understand exactly what's happening.
I'm sorry, but he's my husband.
Look, I knew things were gonna change when you got married, okay ?
I just never realized that that things were gonna change when you got married.
Enjoy the show.
Hey, you guys work it out ?
'Cause, you know, I could go read the playbill and count the male dancers who thank their partner, "Ted".
You know what, sweetie ?
I'm sorry, but I've already made plans with Will.
I didn't know that you were coming back.
I sort of pulled him out of his Christmas plans, so I Hey, it's okay.
I understand.
Hey, you better hurry up, it's starting.
You don't want to miss the almonds and pecans battling for the City of Macadamia.
I have no idea what this show's about.
Thanks, hon.
Okay, come on.
Have fun.
Hi.
Just out of curiosity, how come your hot buttered rums are so bad ?
Just forget it.
I'll take another one.
Leo.
This isn't right.
You should be in there with your wife.
Go on in.
You made a sacrifice to be here, you go.
- You go.
- No, you.
Leo, look.
I'm just gonna have to accept that things are different now that you and Grace are married.
I can deal with it now or I can deal with it later.
I might as well deal with it now.
Yeah.
You don't wanna see it, do you ?
Please don't make me.
I mean, I'm in there five seconds, and the toys start to come to life.
Man, the toys come to life ?
I know.
It was great when I was a kid, but as an adult you think, "That couldn't happen "!
Please, go in there.
No, I ain't watching no dancing toys.
You go.
Well, we can't just leave Grace alone.
Somebody's gotta sit with her.
My mom got a better offer.
Looks like I'm flying solo.
Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the fire is so delightful, and since we've no place to go, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping, and I've got some corn for popping.
The lights are down way down low, Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

Karen.
Why'd you pick such a fancy restaurant ?
We told you we're coming straight from Elliot's game.
- Yeah, where he scored two goals.
- For the other team.
And off my nose.
And they're out.
It's beautiful.
It's like a butt.
What's the occasion ?
Whadaya talk ?
I'm dressed like I always am.
And I resent your implication that I have some kind of hidden agenda.
Hello.
Karen, that's three nights this week.
I'm either incredibly flattered or worried that you're from the health department.
See you brought your friends.
Thanks for noticing.
Ah, yes.
And this is Red, Homo, Homo, and Boy.
Welcome, I'm Milo.
If you need anything, I'm here to serve you.
Actually, the waiters are here to serve you.
I'm here to overcharge you.
It's nice to see you.
Now I know why we're here.
You like him !
Shut up !
Shut up !
He's cute.
You should ask him out.
What ?
You mean like on a date ?
Oh, I don't know.
I've been married to Stan for so long, the last time I was on a date, Bush was president and we were about to go to war with Iraq.
Don't worry, Kare.
It's like riding a bicycle Only you're naked.
And the seat's off.
You can't borrow my bike anymore.
Karen, go ahead, ask him.
He was totally giving you the green light.
You think ?
Yeah, even I saw it, and I'm unconscious.
- Go, go, go.
Get over there.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- How do I look ?
- Here, let me see.
Make up : flawless.
Hair : fabulous.
Breasts I'm jealous.
Now go.
All right, if I'm not back in ten minutes, you can have my drink.
Oh, God, what am I saying ?
That's crazy.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 12 Field Of Queens sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Ah, look at her.
She's all flirty and shy.
Like a teenage girl.
Yeah.
Are you there, God ?
It's me, Satan.
Hey, guess what ?
While we were at Elliot's game, I signed us up for a gay soccer team.
- What ?
- Now, before you pee-pee it Just take a moment and think about it.
It might be fun.
What ?
Forget it.
No, I don't do sports.
I mean, sure I'll flip through a Sports Illustrated if it's already in the bathroom and I'm already happy to see it.
But that's where I draw the line.
Gay soccer isn't sports, silly.
It's cute guys in shorts runnin' around kickin' balls.
It's a gay bar on astro-turf.
You know, you should do it.
You might meet someone.
And you do like the way your legs look in shorts.
I really do.
But I don't know.
Soccer ?
I mean, what color are the uniforms ?
Powder blue with white accents and lemon piping - Cotton ?
- Cotton-poly blend, - very shiny, lotta movement.
- Sounds cute.
Ooh, ooh, I can wear my tinted lenses.
I'm in.
I was thinking, maybe sometime You and I could I don't Taste this.
So it's not spoiled ?
Oh, you're fun.
You wanna You wanna go out sometime ?
- You'd go out with me ?
- Why wouldn't I ?
You're charming and handsome and sexy.
Oh, so you picked up on that ?
I'd love to.
Oh, um By the way, you just took two of my amphetamines.
Huh.
Maybe we should warm up too.
I call the blonde in blue I saw him before you - You the new guys ?
- Hi.
I'm Jack, that's Will.
- I'm Kirk, the captain.
- Oh, so you're Captain Kirk.
Who do we play first, the Romulans or the Klingons ?
All right, listen up.
We're gonna run a few drills, then we're gonna break into teams and do a quick scrimmage.
All right, ladies.
Let's go, let's go.
What ?
Play ?
Now ?
Well, don't worry.
Like you said, it's gay soccer.
We'll probably just run over there and compare Tony predictions.
- I think it's going to be Hairspray.
- Save it for the game.
Everyone was running and kicking and pushing each other over.
It's supposed to be gay soccer.
Where were the lingering hugs, the affectionate ass pats ?
The catchy team theme song ?
Can't believe you didn't do better.
You're so athletic.
Yeah, yeah, laugh it up.
Look at my nose !
My whole face is thrown off now.
It's completely asymmetrical.
I'm like a Picasso.
Or-or-or Shannen Doherty.
Oh, I'm sure you'll do better the next time.
There ain't gonna be no next time, I quit.
I'm turning in my uniform.
Actually, I'm turning it into a tank top.
It just looks better without the sleeves.
Don't sew when you're this angry.
Worst of all, Jack is like a superstar.
The guy can't figure out when to step off an escalator, but he's a genius with a soccer ball.
Will someone talk to this kid ?
He's thinkin' about quitting the team.
Yeah, because I'm awful.
They even have a new nickname for me on the team Awful.
I give up.
I throw up my hands and jut out my hip.
You know what, when I was your age, there were a lot of kids who said I couldn't kiss.
But did I quit kissing ?
I did not.
I stuck with it.
I made out with every guy who would have me.
And today Not you, Whora Flynn Boyle !
He needs to hear it from someone who understands, someone who's as bad as he is.
Will.
- What ?
- Go talk to him.
- I'm not going to - Yeah.
Shh Go talk to him.
Okay, Elliot, look.
Some of my biggest regrets are the things that I didn't follow through on.
You know, like when I gave up the role of Kenickie in my high school production of Grease, because I was afraid to jump off the car during "Grease Lightning".
Do you think a day goes by where I don't think about that ?
God, I hope so.
You see, he learned his lesson.
That's why you don't see him quittin' our team.
Even though he stinks so bad that I, his best friend, am forced to make jokes behind his back.
Yeah, Will, you're sticking with it even though you suck ?
Yes, I am.
Wow, well, then then I guess I can do that too.
Thanks.
You know, that car was really high up, and I don't think a little stepladder would've made my move any less dramatic.
Morning, campers.
So how was your date ?
I didn't hear from you all weekend !
Well, honey, I wanted to call you, but I lost your number.
And do you know how many "Grace Johnsons" there are in the phone book ?
Come on !
We want details.
Was he sweet ?
Was he charming ?
Does he have a gay brother ?
Or better yet, does he have a straight brother who drinks a lot ?
Oh, kids.
It was amazing.
We talked.
We laughed.
He walked me home.
He was such a gentleman.
He opened the door for me.
I opened my shirt for him.
He gave me a little kiss, and we said good night.
Karen and Milo sittin' in a tree.
K- I-S-I-N-G Wait So, when you gonna see him again ?
'Cause you know, it's all about the second date, or as I like to refer to it, "The date when you can slowly let your stomach out".
- Well, uh, he said he would call.
- But it's been three days.
Oh, look who's suddenly a math whiz.
Oh.
Well.
What d'ya know ?
Hello ?
I bet you do.
Who was it ?
Someone looking for a designer.
I didn't catch their name.
You know I feel moody.
I think I'm gonna go change my blood.
Into a Bloody Mary.
- He's gonna call, right ?
- Absolutely.
Truman.
I didn't think you'd come back.
Well I was gonna quit, but I wanna set an example for a young friend of mine.
I'm trying to show him that sticking with something, even though you're not good at it, is its own reward.
Well, if you really want me to put you in the game God, no !
I don't want to play !
What are you gonna do ?
Sit on the sidelines with your needlepoint ?
Nooo.
I brought a picnic basket.
Okay, princesses, huddle up.
Okay, these guys are tough.
But if we can beat this hetero team, we may one day achieve our dream of beating the lesbians.
All right, now come on.
Let's wipe the field up with these candy-ass breeders.
Neiman Marcus !
- Sorry you're not gonna play.
- Don't you worry about me.
You just get out there and win one for the lisper.
I think I'll start with olive tapenade on a bagel chip.
- Finally, tonight - Hey.
I wanna talk to you.
We have a roasted tomato vegetable - May I finish here, please ?
- Fine.
Finish.
Soup.
You are just a real charmer, aren't ya ?
What's next ?
You get them to take their shirts off and then don't call them ?
Well, I tried that with table number five, but it sort of ruined their anniversary.
Who are you ?
Figures you wouldn't remember.
Red.
Of Red, Homo, Homo, and Boy.
Karen Walker's friend.
Right.
So how is Karen ?
Well, if you picked up a phone, you'd know.
Or is that not your style ?
You know, guys like you just drive me Is that pie ?
Yes, but we call it a galette.
That way we can charge $18 for it.
- Would you like to try it ?
- No, I wouldn't.
But I'll take a piece to go.
How dare you treat Karen like that ?
- And how does this concern you ?
- I'm her friend and a woman.
And I'm here on behalf of all women.
Except her.
She's on her own.
How do you expect to earn anyone's trust, if you don't keep your word ?
Could we believe anything you say ?
I mean, look, it says that the special of the night is monkfish cooked in a saffron sauce.
Is it ?
Or is it just a giant turd cooked in poison ?
It's not.
Look, I am trying to run a business here.
- You said you would call her.
- Yes, and that made her happy.
She went home thinking that I was still interested.
She also went home thinking people work in toll booths because they have tails.
What do you mean, you're not interested in her ?
I mean, what's wrong with her ?
Well, first of all she's a little old for me.
She's exactly your age.
That's what I'm saying, she's a little old for me.
And when I kissed her good night, I just didn't feel anything.
Listen, mister, I've kissed Karen more times than I can count.
And every single time, I felt somethin'.
Perhaps it was you.
Let's investigate.
- You're a pig !
- Oh, so you picked up on that ?
- You know what ?
- What ?
This little playboy shtick of yours is gettin' old.
You know someday, very soon, you're gonna wake up, and you're gonna find yourself very alone.
Well, maybe not very soon.
But it's gonna happen.
Good day.
Milo said that I could have a piece of pie.
And a Cornish game hen.
I'll be outside.
Look's pretty tasty.
Way to hustle.
Oh, thank you.
Lorna Doone ?
- I'll take some of that.
- Don't you have a game today ?
Uh, yeah, probably starting right about now.
I quit.
What ?
What happened to sticking with something, with not quitting just because it's hard ?
You know ?
I thought we had a good talk the other night.
I thought I was a role model for you.
I see you, like, once every eight months.
Still I ever saw you as a quitter.
You know, I mean, look at me.
I'm no good at this, but here I am working my ass off just just waitin' to get in there.
Waitin' !
Truman, Carlo's hurt.
- I'm hurt !
- Get in there.
What ?
But-but-but I'm picnicking.
Can't you send someone else, like-like this kid ?
No way, man.
You're my role model.
You're in, Truman.
Wrap that biscotti in parchment paper and get out there.
But I just dipped it in espresso !
McFarland !
I know Betty McUseless is your friend, but don't pass to him.
If we win, we get free facials at Sonya Dakar.
- And a basket of scented candles.
- Oh, my God I'm not about to blow that.
- Hey, Karen.
- Oh, Grace.
You've been awfully quiet.
I've been gone for two hours.
You're funny.
Uh, listen, I don't mean to sound negative, and I shouldn't because I'm taking six different pills so I won't, but Uh, do you think it's weird that Milo hasn't called ?
Sweetie, I don't think he's gonna call.
Why ?
Look, I didn't want to tell you this because I was afraid it would hurt your feelings, but Milo is sick.
Sick ?
Oh, my gosh, I better call him.
No, no, no, no, no.
He can't talk to you because he's, uh, he's he's had his throat removed.
Doy !
Well, that explains it.
Well, wait a minute then, what's holding up his head ?
Good question.
Yeah, I asked the same thing.
Um, there's this stick-like apparatus.
I'm familiar And the head is propped on Karen, I just came from over there, and Milo doesn't want to see you anymore.
He just is He doesn't like the Karen, he just doesn't see how wonderful you are.
And I know that's hard cause this is the first date that you've had in a long time, but But don't let it put you off, because someone out there will.
Well, thanks, honey.
But I'm a big girl, I can take it.
Tell me what he said.
He said you were too old.
Oh.
Well, now I'm glad his head's on a stick.
You know, it's strange how things have changed for the two of us over the last year.
I'm a married lady giving out dating advice.
Now you're the single girl, starting your life over.
- I like it.
- I hate it.
I know you do.
Here I am.
I'm the mean machine.
I'm fast and lean.
I'm What rhymes with lean ?
Penis ?
I just said penis.
What am I doing again ?
Oh, soccer !
Right.
How did the Q-Tip miss that ?
Oh, look at him.
Lonely girl.
I should pass to him.
It'd make him feel good.
Don't pass it to me.
Please, if there's a God, do not pass it to me.
Oh, god, it's coming to me Run away !
Uh, I like being carried.

Listen to this one.
Hey, guys, just wanted to remind you about brunch at our place in Brooklyn today.
Can't wait, Love you.
She actually thinks we're going to Brooklyn ?
I'm not leaving the state for brunch !
- That's so stupid.
- Okay, it gets better.
Guys, where are you ?
I've got salmon.
I've got caviar.
I've got fruit.
Get over here.
Love you !
She could be serving it on top of a Calvin Klein underwear model, I still ain't going to Brooklyn.
- How sad is that ?
- It can't get any sadder.
Can't it ?
Nice, real nice.
You better be coming.
You guys suck !

Hey.
Have you guys gotten any of those messages from Grace ?
They're hilarious !
- Blah blah blah - Love you !
Oh So, Wilma, honey, listen.
I forget, what are you these days, gay or straight ?
Let me do a little test.
Okay, there's a penis and a vagina in a tent.
And it's on fire.
Which do you save ?
Why are they in a tent ?
Honey, I'm trying to do you a favor !
I wanna set you up with my cousin, Barry.
What ?
Why him ?
Why not me ?
Will's hideous !
No, you're not.
He's gross !
Not really.
People flee from him !
Not everyone.
Will needs it more than you do.
- He's desperate !
- Hey, I resent that.
- Cute and desperate.
- Thank you.
Now, listen to me.
Barry is a great guy.
Honey, he's smart.
He's handsome.
Oh, he makes the greatest German dill potato salad for family picnics.
"Dill" ?
That's his best quality ?
He uses dill ?
All right, I'll go out with him.
Now, listen, you're meeting him tonight at eight at the Sherry Bar.
And wear something tight.
You got good stuff in there.
Guys !
What are you doing ?
I've been sitting in my apartment all day.
I though you were coming to visit me !
We were just leaving.
We we're on our way.
We're there.
Where are you ?
Hello ?
Thanks a lot.
You know, Brooklyn is where I live now.
And I would think that my friends could take two minutes out of their lives to come visit me.
Who needs ya ?
I'm going home.
It's so far.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 13 Fagmalion Part One Gay It Forward sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Yes !
Leo, all my stuff is unpacked and the boxes are gone.
I know finally.
Yes, that's a lie.
But, I promise you I will only lie about the insignificant things.
Yes, that's another lie.
I'll see you later tonight, okay ?
I'll have a nice dinner waiting.
Yes, that is too.
- Who is it ?
- Your neighbor.
I brought you a housewarming gift.
It's a cat.
Her name's Pees-On-My-Bed, but feel free to change it to Pees-On-Your-Bed.
Thanks, but, um, I'm allergic.
Oh, well that's ok.
She's a rescue, she didn't expect much out of life.
I'll just go drown her in the tub with the others.
What ?
No !
Kidding.
I'm jus trying to guilt you.
Go home, baby.
God !
You have huge feet too.
I like that.
Yeah.
I waited my whole life to develop, and those are the only things that grew.
- I'm Julie.
- Grace.
- Adler.
- Adler.
I know.
The old ladies upstairs told me.
By the way, that's where all your magazines are.
Interesting.
Well, the next time Mrs. Rabinowitz fights me for a cab, boom.
She's going right down.
Oh.
You're dark.
Leo needs that.
You know, we have a nickname for him in the building : "Wish I were doing him instead of my husband".
You have no boundaries.
I like that.
So, do you need a hand unpacking ?
I'm happy to help unless you have a bunch of personal, weird stuff you don't want me to see.
No.
Just don't open the one marked "Tools".
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Traffic was a biatch.
Okay.
Clearly Karen meant to fi this guy up with me.
So here's how I see it.
Barry and I have dinner.
You cry quietly at a nearby table until I signal you to pay the check.
I go home with him.
You cook us brunch tomorrow.
Eggs, please.
Interesting.
Here's how I see it.
I grab you by the ear.
I drag you to the door.
And I push you in front of a car.
Wait !
You don't understand.
- Barry is my soul mate.
- You haven't even met him.
- I love him !
- You're crazy.
Crazy in love !
Hey.
You got the time ?
I'm supposed to meet my date here at eight.
Oh, it's ten after.
You know women, they love to make an entrance.
Apparently so does Will.
Oh.
Uh, I'm Will.
Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
You know, I don't go on a lot of dates, but at some point aren't we supposed to be at the same table ?
Not always.
- I'm Will.
- Barry.
Cousin Karen didn't do you justice.
You're hot.
She didn't do you justice either.
You're you're here.
- So, shall we order ?
- Let's order.
Kind of a late lunch so I and you're holding my hand.
It's just, uh Dating it's, uh, a little new for me.
Were you in a long term relationship ?
Six years.
It was pretty serious.
- Oh.
What was his name ?
- Mary Elizabeth.
Was that his drag name ?
'Cause I think I may have seen his show.
No, it's a woman.
I've never been out with a guy before.
You're my first !
- Can I get anyone a drink ?
- Oh, yeah.
What do we homosexuals drink, Will ?
Well, legally we can drink whatever we want.
That was established in the Flaming Schnapps Act of 1983.
Oh, man, this is going great.
High five !
Hey, thanks for helping me unpack.
Wedding pictures.
Oh, no no no.
You don't want to look at that.
It's fifth in a series.
You need to start with volume one.
Grace, God.
This dress is gorgeous.
Everything's so nice.
When we got married in my sister's backyard, there was dog poop everywhere and she wore shorts.
My sister was so high at my wedding she thought it was my bat mitzvah.
She kept shoving 20's down my dress.
So we have a lot in common.
Our sisters are bitches.
Both our husbands are doctors.
Well, mine's playing one in some Chekhov play in the Bowery.
He makes $80 a week.
And apparently he's not very good.
Your husband's an actor.
You're a massage therapist.
That is so cool and bohemian.
My husband's a doctor.
How come we live in the same building ?
The apartment belonged to my uncle.
He died last year.
- I'm sorry.
- Keep it to yourself.
We haven't told the super.
- Your back ?
- Yeah, I pulled it at the gym.
Well, on the phone talking about going to the gym.
Well, let me give you a massage.
I'll grab my table.
No.
No, no, no.
You've done too much for me already.
Oh, please.
I'm just so happy to talk to a neighbor about something other than the Holocaust.
Damn, Grace, you're so tense.
You're all knots and bones.
It's like massaging a frozen turkey.
Oh That feels so good.
- Is the pressure okay ?
- Perfect How about here ?
- I'm just gonna go a little lower.
- You go wherever you need to go.
Well Thank you, Karen.
I had my date with Barry last night.
Tell me everything.
skip the begging and the tears.
That I can't stomach.
Let's start with his stomach.
It's soft like a baby's.
And like a baby, he just came out !
Yeah, well, you're no prize pig yourself.
You got a layer of pink flab, a pug nose, a squiggly little tail Hey, wait, maybe you are a prize pig !
Why are you in my life, you awful, awful woman ?
The point is, you are desperate and he's family.
So why don't you two join together in misery and make a rotten go of it ?
Honey, you must like him.
You sent him flowers and asked him to go out with you again tonight.
I didn't send him any Oh, God !
Oh, honey, it made his day.
And so did that picture of you sound asleep, making a human pyramid in your Joe Boxers.
What ?
Oh my God, I thought that was a dream.
Rosario in camouflage, with a feather and a zoom lens.
Great.
Now I've gotta let him down easy.
Hey, hey, save it for the locker room.
Unbelievable !
I've got my own problems !
Karen, be honest.
All right, I pinched Paul Lynde's wallet at the Desert Inn in '84.
Well, that would explain why on your job application under references you wrote, "Not Paul Lynde".
Look, help me with this.
I just met my new neighbor, Julie.
She's a massage therapist.
She was helping me unpack and then she gave me a massage, which I think went a little too far south.
Honey, you must've brought it on yourself.
- What were you wearing ?
- I was naked, under a sheet.
Hmm, that's not it.
Oh, my God.
I got it.
I got it.
Karen, make an appointment with her.
If she does the same thing to you then I know it's just part of the massage.
- But if she doesn't do it to you - Then I'll do it to her.
No.
Then I will know that she was coming on to me.
Ah.
Honey, exactly where did she touch you ?
Show me on this bottle of vodka.
Right on the Smirnoff.
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- Please, just hear me out.
I have waited my whole life to find love.
And then, when it finally happens I am denied.
And by who-em ?
My best friend.
Please, Will, let me love.
- Hey, Barry.
- I'll see you later.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I didn't know what to wear for our second homosexual date.
Oh, traditionally, whatever's hanging on your homosexual chair in your homosexual bedroom.
Here, I, uh, got you a present.
It was 49.99.
Oh, look at that.
It's a rainbow flag beach towel.
Do you already have one ?
You probably already have one.
No, I don't.
And it'll come in handy, when I want people from space to know that I'm gay.
I just thought I should get you something since you sent me those beautiful flowers.
Look I gotta tell you something.
I didn't I didn't send you those flowers.
Karen, in her twisted way, thought she was trying to help.
Oh.
Heh.
I thought it was a little weird when the card said, "Thanks for all the good gay sex, honey".
Look, Barry, you're a great guy.
- But I - It's okay.
I'm sorry I'm not better at this.
I was bad at being straight, now I'm bad at being gay.
- It gets easier.
- I guess.
It's just I really like you.
- You don't even know me.
- I know you enough.
You're nice.
You're really smart.
- You're handsome.
- I know I'm sorry, Barry, I just I don't feel the same way about you.
But I know someone out there will.
You're gonna do great.
Look, let's let's order.
You know, it says "no sharing", but I say let's share.
And dare them to oppose us.
What do you say ?
You know what, I think I'd rather go home.
But thanks.
I'll see you, Will.
Keep the towel.
So, what happened ?
Did she knock, knock, knock on heaven's door ?
What a waste !
I choppered that girl in from Brooklyn and all I got was a lousy massage !
I get more play outta Rosie when she's washing my bra with me still in it.
Great.
I guess I'm gonna have to have a talk with Julie.
Same talk I had with the gift wrappers at Bloomingdale's.
Shouldn't your finger be on that box ?
I just saw Barry leave.
What happened ?
Look, I just bought this bag from the guy out front.
Why are you buying a woman's purse ?
'Cause it goes with the shoes.
Why so sad, big tiny ?
I just had to let Barry down.
The guy just came out and his first real date rejects him.
What ?
He's never been with a man before ?
So he's the virgin Barry.
- I feel bad for him.
- Of course you feel bad.
You are Barry.
Barry is you.
Ergo, you is Barry.
Ergo, you is idiot.
Perhaps.
But I remember another boy who struggled on his way out of the closet.
He had a little crush on me.
I found him repellent.
But still, I took him under my wing.
I fixed his hair.
- Taught him how to dress.
- Yeah, you sent me to job interview wearing leg warmers with Chinese slippers.
Perhaps.
But the point is, we senior gays have a responsibility to the freshmen.
To teach them, to bring them along.
Why, I helped turn this caterpillar into a chubby butterfly.
- And now you should do the same for Barry.
- Why ?
Why is this my responsibility ?
Because that's what we do in the community.
We gay it forward.
How long you been sitting on that one ?
Pretty much since the movie came out.
Listen, I need to talk to you about something.
Um, the massage last night This is gonna sound crazy.
But did it mean more to you than it did to me ?
Well, I didn't get paid, so I doubt it.
No, no.
What I mean is - Did you come onto me ?
- What ?
'Cause you were really thorough.
Dude.
I'm a massage therapist, okay ?
I go where the tension is.
It really bums me out that you would think anything different.
Oh, oh, gosh.
I'm so sorry.
Of course.
I mean, I just I didn't realize I was tense there.
- Maybe I should go.
- No, don't go.
I'm sorry.
I'm from the city.
We are not a trusting people.
So I You know, I wasn't sure.
I mean we were up all night drinking and laughing.
And it ended with what I thought was inappropriate touching.
Seemed like a lot of dates I've been on.
Grace, when was the last time you had a girlfriend ?
I mean, this is what we do.
We talk.
We kiss.
We hug.
We get to be intimate.
It's what makes us better than men.
Why do you think they die first ?
I don't really have a lot of girlfriends.
Well, I do, but they're men.
Look, I gotta jet.
But tomorrow night, you wanna catch a film ?
- I'd love to.
- Good, 'cause Greg's gonna be off somewhere doing stand-up.
I mean, he doesn't make me laugh, but God bless.
See you then.
This is my friend, Jack.
He'll be assisting me in this project.
Now get dressed, we're going to the gym.
It's after midnight.
You're not ready to be seen during peak cruising hours.
- What's this about ?
- We're here to help.
You got a late start, but we're gonna take care of you and raise you right.
Think of us as your 'mo pair.
- How long you been sitting on that one ?
- Just since the cab.
Here's your starter kit : All the Tales of the City books, Kiehl's non-alcohol face toner, Ethel Merman Gypsy, Angela Lansbury Gypsy, Tyne Daly Gypsy, and Pez.
- Why Pez ?
- Because it's fun.
See, candy comes out of the neck.
There's so much to learn.
Well, you're in good hands.
I just had a beautiful manicure.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I love "24".
But it's so unrealistic.
I mean, it's 2 PM and he hasn't even peed yet.
I've gone twice just watching it.
Woof !
When did Kiefer Sutherland get so hot ?
He didn't, sweetie What the hell did you two Mork and Mindy looking sons of bitches do to my cousin Barry ?
You're supposed to help him be gay but you didn't finish.
The poor kid's so confused, he's sittingat home on the couch watching football in a spandex onesie.
We just got started.
This is a guy who 24 hours ago thought that Batman and Robin just fought crime together.
- We're makin' progress.
- Yeah, well, step it up.
The Human Rights Campaign gala is in a month.
It's the social event of the gay season.
Well, next to the Republican National Convention.
- And I want Barry to be ready for it.
- Karen, he's 20 pounds overweight, he shops at Miller's Outpost, and he has a beard.
I don't mean "taking your mother to the Academy Awards" kind of beard.
I mean actual facial hair.
- He's right, Kare.
- Can't be done.
Homo wasn't built in a day.
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause I was, uh, going through my jeans this morning, and I found 20 grand in that little pocket.
And I was thinking that you guys could use that to bankroll this whole operation and, uh, keep whatever's left over for yourselves, but, oh, well.
Would you just excuse us for a second ?
We'll do it.
And I'm sorry you had to see that.
Grace !
Did you just get in ?
How was your flight ?
I live in Brooklyn.
I took the subway.
Right, right, right.
So what was the in-flight movie ?
Well, a smelly guy in Army fatigues did a dance for me.
I love that guy.
He taught me this move.
Why do homeless guys always wear Army stuff ?
Never the Navy, never a nice pea coat, or a sailor hat.
Anyway, I just wanted to give you guys a heads-up.
Leo and I are having a housewarming party.
Now don't freak out about getting us a present.
Don't go running from store to store.
'Cause everything I want is on this list.
I'm not getting you another present.
I haven't even got a thank-you note for the two wedding gifts I got you.
Well, we need more stuff.
What can I tell you ?
Oh, honey, I'd love to go !
Oh, Brooklyn in the winter.
Oh, you know what, I'm gonna use my miles !
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 14 Fagmalion Part Two Attack Of The Clones sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Karen ?
Did you sync up my Palm Pilot ?
I sure did, honey.
I also optimized your hard drive and traced that printer problem to a bad ethernet cable.
Have I been drinking ?
Come on, now, honestly, honey, I'm a little more together than you think.
Hey, hey.
Anyone order a cookie bouquet ?
The talking cookies !
They're baaack !
Sure, they talk.
But do they listen ?
Honey.
What are you doing here ?
I thought you were elbow deep in someone's colon.
Yeah.
But then the office party ended.
So Listen, I got some bad news.
I don't think we can do that - housewarming thing this weekend.
- No, I told you.
When people complain about having to give another gift, you say that their first one never arrived.
The thing is Do you remember the other day, I saw you in the kitchen in that mid-afternoon light.
I said, "Man, you are the most beautiful woman in the world.
How did I get so lucky "?
Yeah, I'm going to Africa for a month.
I leave on Friday.
What ?
No, you're What ?
Doctors Without Borders called.
That clinic I helped set up last summer, they're way understaffed.
There's a virus and a vaccine.
And I have to be there.
Plus they think I'm on "ER".
I can't believe they're having a viral outbreak the same weekend as our housewarming party.
Why do these things always happen to me ?
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I know.
- I'm just gonna miss you.
- I know.
I'm gonna miss you too.
We can talk more about it later.
I gotta go pick up some toys.
I fathered, like, ten kids in that village.
If I show up empty-handed, there will be hell to pay.
Honey are the cookies gone ?
Okay, so we're clear on this, right ?
You're gonna be in charge of Barry's body.
I'm gonna work on his mind.
Things like gay culture, gay politics, driving up the cost of real estate in affordable areas.
Okay.
But if you have his mind and I have the body, who gets the hair ?
'Cause it grows out of the mind, but it's still kinda part of the body.
That's a very good question.
And that makes me feel even better about being in charge of the mind.
We'll save the hair for last.
This is a huge project.
It's such an awesome responsibility to think of someone other than myself.
I'm a good person.
I'm a great person.
Oh, come on, Barry.
This is an easy one.
- Um, I'm not sure.
- Take a guess.
- Salma Hayek ?
- Salma Hayek ?
Is that not a real person ?
I don't even know how I know that name.
It's Vivian Leigh from Gone With the Wind !
How can a person not know that ?
I'm tired and thirsty.
Can I have a Coke ?
It's Diet Coke.
And no !
Come on !
Let's go, let's go !
Push !
Remember : No pecs, no sex !
This all seems so superficial.
Are gay guys only about bodies and faces ?
Absolutely not.
They're only about bodies.
Faces you can cover up with a cute hat or leather hood.
Looser, looser.
Tighter, tighter.
Pull it in !
Look, um this move unless you're one of the Brady kids, should be stricken from your dance vocabulary.
Okay, Barry.
Now, come on.
Sit here, sweetheart.
Watch and learn, all right ?
And note, these moves can also be performed on roller skates, okay ?
Man, making someone gay is exhausting.
I don't know how my mother did it.
Oh, no.
Is it 5:00 already ?
Yeah, the cab's out front.
Boy, 28 hours on a plane.
What do you bet I still won't get through the corrections ?
You know, I am so proud of you.
Tonight I'm gonna close my eyes and imagine I'm in Africa with you, helping the needy.
Till "The Osbournes" start.
Then you're on your own.
Okay, I gotta go save some lives.
Yeah, I gotta go save 50%.
Barney's is having a sale.
Bye.
I love you.
I don't blame you.
Bye.
Yes ?
Um, if you see some cute bowls for cheap, totally stock up.
And don't agree on the first price, 'cause they expect you to haggle.
Grace, these people don't have water.
I didn't say they were good at haggling.
What ?
I'll get a bowl, okay ?
I'll take their food and dump it on the ground and take the bowl.
No, I just don't want you to forget to pay the gas bill.
It's due on the 21st.
Yeah, I'll pay them in wildebeests.
- Grace, I'm gonna be sub-Saharan Africa.
- Hey, I work too.
I didn't say you didn't.
I just assumed, while I was gone, you'd take care of the household stuff.
Oh.
'Cause I'm a housewife now ?
Suddenly, I'm the woman ?
Should I crank out a couple of kids while you're gone too ?
Grace, I really don't have time for this.
I have to get to the airport and exchange my 100 American dollars for ten billion Zairian dollars.
Fine, then I'm coming with you.
'Cause we haven't even begun to discuss who's gonna wash the dishes that are still in the sink.
- He's pretty cute, isn't he ?
- Yeah.
- Go talk to him.
- What ?
I can't do that.
He's out of my league.
He's an all-star.
I'm barely in the minors.
Sports again ?
What did I tell you to do when those thoughts come into your head ?
Right.
Judy, Liza, Barbra, Bette, these are names I shan't forget.
Good.
Or Dream Girls, Company, Chorus Line, these three shows are quite divine.
Come on, you can do this.
That's easy for you to say.
You're a god.
Please.
A "god".
In what way am I like a god ?
You're hot.
You're successful.
Every guy in this bar is checking you out.
No, they're not.
Look, I was once where you are.
Sorry, you're blocking their view of me.
Everyone has a first time, Barry.
- I can't believe you were ever like me.
- Well, I was.
In my first time in a gay bar, I was no more comfortable than you are.
I've just been out a couple of weeks, and Jack just decided to throw me into the deep end - What do you think you're doing ?
- I'm eating peanuts.
Have you lost your mind ?
Those are little pellets of fat and breath.
You might as well be chewing on loneliness.
Have you asked anyone to dance ?
Have you talked to anybody ?
Have you done anything ?
I can't.
I feel like everyone's judging me.
Well, of course they are.
It's a gay bar.
Now, come on.
Get out there.
Who do you like ?
What about that guy ?
I saw you doing one of these when we walked in.
What ?
That guy ?
No, he'd never go out with me.
How do you know until you try ?
Come on, do it, Will.
- Come on, you got nothing to lose.
- I'm scared.
We're all scared.
You gotta develop thick skin.
And then moisturize and sleep in gloves.
Come on, go.
- Jack, stop it.
- Go, go.
- Hi, I'm Will.
- Zack.
- I'm Will.
- Still Zack.
Sorry.
Talk to him.
Talk to him.
Talk.
Look, I've never done this before, but Sure, I'll go out with you.
Just like that, I got my first date.
He ended up stealing my identity and traveling around Europe on my credit cards, but that "yes" felt good.
- There's your guy.
Come on, make your move.
- Really ?
No, I don't know.
I Come on, come on.
Do it.
Get your "yes".
And don't give out your PIN number, even if he says he needs it to "do your chart".
- Hi, I haven't done this much, but - No.
Okay, how 'bout this ?
I'll pay the bills, but when you come home, you are going to wash the oatmeal pot.
You know what, honey, why don't you send me the pot ?
It'll be a nice break from bringing people back from the brink of death.
Brink of death ?
Give me a break.
You're staying at a Hyatt.
This is ridiculous.
We're here.
Oh, oh, oh, look at that.
You took the luggage we just got as a wedding present.
I guess it's just for you.
Okay, I think I know what's going on here.
Oh, really ?
Enlighten me, Mr. Take-My-Luggage.
It's Doctor Take-My-Luggage.
Come on, Grace.
You're pickin' a fight with me 'cause you don't want to say good-bye.
You're having trouble dealing with the fact that we just got married, and now I'm going away for awhile.
And maybe if you're mad at me, then you won't have to deal with your real feelings about me leaving.
Is any of this true ?
And don't answer me with any of the sounds your dad makes after dinner.
Hey !
His chair makes weird sounds.
When you ask him to do it again, he can't !
I have to go.
- Do you really want to leave it like this ?
- You're the one leaving !
Okay.
Fine.
I'll see you in a month.
Good-bye.
- Barry, wait.
- Forget it, Will.
Look, I appreciate everything you've done, but I want to go home.
No, you can't leave.
You're doing great.
Great ?
The guy said no before I even finished my sentence.
He put his hand in my face.
That's gay for "Stop in the name of love".
And then come here.
- I'm not an idiot.
- I know.
It'd be a lot easier if you were.
Idiots do really well in these places.
just got three numbers.
And I just stole the wallet of "Who's The Boss"'s Danny Pintauro.
I'll see you guys later.
If I leave now, I can cry in the tub and still have time to eat everything in the fridge.
Barry, don't go.
Don't you want to have your first man-on-man kiss tonight and give me something to call your religious maniac parents about ?
I can't do this.
Just because Will got a guy on his first night in a gay bar, doesn't mean I can.
Oh, please, is that what he told you ?
Well, I did score my first time out.
Ish Come on, just go out with my friend.
There's 20 bucks in it for you.
Which one is he ?
Okay, 40.
And you can lose the 'tude.
You act like you know Wham!
or something.
You paid him to go out with me ?
- We talked about this.
- We have not !
Oh.
Well, I talk to other people about it.
Even I got a few miles out of that one at the family picnic.
- Wait, that was you ?
- Cousin Gina laughed so hard, coleslaw came out of the hole in her neck.
Oh, boy.
I gotta call that Gina.
She's such a Oh, crap.
There's Danny Pintauro, and he looks pissed.
- You are unbelievable.
- What's the big deal ?
It's not like you just found out you're adopted or Canadian.
The big deal is that all of my confidence as a gay man is based on that moment.
- And now it's a lie.
- I was just trying to help you - the way we're helping Barry.
- Do not compare me to Barry !
Why not ?
Look at him.
That wreck is you Oh, please !
I was never as bad as he is !
Barry's pathetic !
- Stop it.
- Barry.
This does not concern you, okay ?
We are discussing Barry right now.
Stop talking about me like I'm not even here.
You call me pathetic, but I look at you guys, and all you care about are superficial things, like the homoerotic subtext of "The A-Team".
Or how to make your butt stand out, even in a dense fog.
I didn't come out so I could be in your twisted production of My Fairy Lady.
I came out so I could find a guy and fall in love.
So what do you two have to teach me ?
You got a 15-year head start, and you're both alone.
Now who's pathetic ?
Whew, I gave Pintauro the slip.
Now who wants a drink ?
I got "Who's The Boss" money !
Ugh, he calls me selfish.
When you think about it, isn't helping people even more selfish ?
And then he tries to make it seem like I'm unreasonable.
- I'not the one being unreasonable.
- Grace.
Yes, I am.
Turn around.
I can't leave it like this.
And I'm telling you now, if I forget to tip, it's just 'cause I'm upset.
Now here's the thing.
If something's bothering me, I just say it.
I don't try to hide it.
I don't make somebody guess what it is.
I don't bury it in conversation about pots or luggage.
Why should I indulge her craziness ?
Because you love her.
Crap !
That's what the Skycap said Will, do you think I'm pathetic ?
No, of course not.
You think I'm pathetic ?
Sometimes.
That's not how that's supposed to go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Gimme again, gimme again.
Do you think I'm pathetic ?
Sometimes.
He really nailed us.
Shallow, vain.
Are we those guys ?
No.
Of course not.
Speaking of "veins", I got a new one coming in on my forearm.
I think I'm gonna name him Kevin.
He's absolutely right.
I am alone.
- What makes me such an expert ?
- No, Jocelyn.
Hi, Jocelyn.
Look, um, I'm sorry.
I think I was a little hard on you before.
Don't apologize, Barry.
Will needed to hear it.
Anyway, if you're still into it, I'd like to start training again.
'Cause even if you are kinda superficial, I'd rather go through this with someone than go through it alone.
- We'd be honored.
- Plus, if you can manage it, I'd really like to look like this guy.
Check out those abs.
Aren't they fabulous ?
- Was that ?
- I think it was.
Baby's first "fabulous".
Get the camcorder.
Are those - Is that Gucci on your feet ?
- Oh, yeah.
Aren't they great ?
They kill my toes and cost a fortune, but what the hell ?
I'll take out another credit card.
I think I'm gonna cry.
Will, do you know what this means ?
- Unrealistic body expectations.
- Choosing fashion over comfort.
Living beyond your means.
Boy George, I think he's got it !
Ma'am, I need you to take your seat.
We're getting ready for takeoff.
Yeah, I need to find my husband.
We're flying together.
Now !
You know, you're not supposed to use that while we're taxiing.
Yeah, well, you're not supposed to take two blankets either, so let's just mind our own beeswax.
- Hello ?
- Hi, Leo.
You'll never believe what I did.
Um, what seat are you in ?
I'm not sitting.
I just got home.
- Home ?
- I just thought we needed a real good-bye, so I switched my flight to tomorrow.
Where are you ?
Karen.
Karen.
Leave me alone.
Karen Please, what do you cookies want from me ?
We're not the cookies.
We're the pencil sharpener !
Oh, thank God !
For a second there, I thought the cookies were talking to me.
Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Okay, I have a big problem with this love letter you wrote to your husband in Africa ?
Where did you get this ?
I gave this to Karen to mail yesterday.
Yeah, and she gave it to me to read, laugh at, and make copies of.
That's how we've been doing it for years.
That is a gross invasion of privacy !
Besides, I thought that's what we did to Will !
Come on, you gotta throw us a little something spicy in there.
Where do you keep recent photos of yourself squatting naked on a sheepskin rug ?
Right next to the picture of me doing this.
All right, come over to my apartment tonight.
We'll start all over.
Bring some tracing paper, and don't wear any underwear.
Tempting but Will and I are getting together.
Finally.
It's been, like, forever.
I mean, between me living in Brooklyn and him working all the time And now you're thinking about tracing your own thing.
- Ah, hey, Karen.
What are ya doin' ?
- Oh, just a sec.
Stanley walker is a dirty pig, and I hope he rots in hellll !
I'm good.
How are you guys ?
- Problem with Stan ?
- I can't believe him.
Parading around town with that new British slut of his !
Last week they had dinner at the mayor's mansion.
Apparently, she spent the entire night sitting on his lap, feeding him steaks.
'Ere's a nice T-bone for ya, love.
Hope you saved room for a bucket of "po-tah-toes".
Oh, I regret the day I ever laid boobs on that man !
- God, that's just awful.
- Yeah.
Okay, your turn.
Kare, during all my struggles, you've constantly been partially there for me.
Is there anything I can pretend to do for you now ?
Well, there is, Jackie.
You know, there's, uh, one last box of my personal effects at the mans.
It's mostly sentimental stuff Old photos, birthday cards.
The receipt I got when Rosario's parents sold her to me.
That kinda thing.
What are you saying ?
I mean, would I like to spend a few unsupervised hours rummaging through your closet ?
Does a gay bear have anonymous sex in the woods ?
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 15 Homojo sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ God, that doorman's a real jerk.
I lived here five years.
I move out, suddenly, Tony looks at me like he's never seen me before ?
Tony retired at Christmas, Grace.
That's the new doorman, Abe, who's black, while Tony was white.
I don't see people that way.
So you ready to rock the house ?
You ready to kick out the jams ?
- Let's do it to it.
I brought the cheese.
- She brought the cheese !
Oh, you actually brought cheese.
Yeah.
Cheese night.
Like we used to do.
Brought a little camembert, a little stilton, a little gouda and some Kraft singles, 'cause I love that clammy feeling when you hold them up against your face.
I've been off dairy for two months.
Didn't I tell you ?
- Did you ?
- I thought I did.
- So, no cheese ?
- Sorry.
But hey, hey, hey !
We can still do movie night !
I got The Rookie.
I know Baseball, yuck.
But Dennis Quaid, yum !
And Dennis Quaid in a cup yummer.
Um, I already saw that with Leo.
But we were gonna see it together.
- Six months ago.
- You know what ?
It's fine.
That just means that we have the whole night to sit here and talk.
Yes, we have tons to catch up on.
What are you doing in this closet ?
You look like the kind of man that should be coming out of one.
I have business here.
Who are you ?
I might ask the same question of you.
Why, I'm Jack, Karen's friend.
She didn't wanna come 'cause she didn't wanna run into that British slut.
With your thick Hungarian accent, you obviously work here.
Have you have you met her ?
What's she like ?
Well, she's got curly hair, like me, long legs, like me.
She shags like a banshee, like me.
And her favorite dance move is this.
So you're that tart from the prison who stole Karen's husband right out from on top of her !
I'm the new woman in Stan's life.
Lorraine Finster.
Get a load of me.
Stay away from me !
Don't look at me !
Or my package !
How can I not ?
It's looking at me.
You like it now, you should see it at night, when it's all lit up.
No !
No !
Karen Walker's my friend !
I don't want anything to do with you !
Good day, Miss.
I said, good day !
Are you a dancer ?
Why would you say that ?
Well, it struck me that you have the bearing of a dancer.
Now, perhaps I'm wrong, but I was a ballerina back in the U.K..
So I tend to have a bit of an eye for these things.
Well Heh heh In some circles, I'm known as a dancer.
Actually, they're not so much circles, as cages.
Well actually I wasn't so much a ballerina, as a stripper.
- Bon-bon ?
- Uh, love one.
Wow.
We were both at the bottom, and we pulled ourselves up with true grit and other people's money.
I admire us.
- I'm a little in love with you.
- Really ?
'Cause I feel like I could fall too.
But I can't !
You're the enemy !
- Or am I your new best friend ?
- Damn, I think you are !
Honey, uh I'm a little concerned that you and Will aren't connecting anymore.
- Why do you say that ?
- Oh, well, you mention it in this letter you wrote to your husband in Africa.
God, you people !
That's awful !
Unless we're doing it to Will !
Things are weird with us.
We're off.
It's like we've lost our mojo.
Or, in our case, our "homojo".
Well, honey, you know what you have to do, huh ?
Seduce him.
Yeah, go to La Perla, buy some sexy thongs and bra undershirts Put on some Paul Anka, bend him over the couch, and have at him !
You know Will and I don't have sex.
Well, then, honey, what's your version of sex, huh ?
What gets you two excited ?
- The most excited ?
- Uh-huh.
Yeah.
That would have to be, without question game night.
Ooohh !
Game night !
Ooh, sounds tedious.
- You should do that.
- You know what ?
You're right.
We should !
It is so It's so fun !
Every year, Joe and Larry and Rob and Ellen come over, and we have this this big, huge parlor game blowout.
We play for the "Suck On It" cup.
God, that's tragic !
What's that ?
It's a trophy.
And we call it the "suck on it" cup because when you win And Will and I always win You get to turn to the losers and say, "Suck on it "!
.
Which lever do I pull to be crushed by a safe ?
Well, honey, what are you waiting for ?
I mean, come on, call that Mo and Mary and Blob and Yellen and get 'em over to your place !
God, this is just perfect.
This is this is just what Will and I need.
Thank you, Karen.
You know, sometimes, even a wet brain makes sense.
- Anyway, here's your stuff.
- Oh, Jackie, thank you.
At last, I'm out of Stan's shadow.
Well, if I leave the Tristate area.
No prob, it was cinchy.
So, I'll see ya later.
- Jack ?
- I'm sorry !
I met Stan's new girlfriend, Lorraine.
We spent the whole day together.
It was magical.
Like a movie.
Like something Miramax would shove down the Academy's throat during Oscar time.
There, I said it.
Uh, I was just gonna ask you why my teddy is missing.
Oh, I'm gonna add a flounce to make him more masculine.
Anyway, Kare you'd really like her.
The three of us should go away for the weekend together.
Amish country, maybe.
Huh, fun.
I do like a nice apple butter.
So it's it's okay ?
Oh, cutie, of course it is !
Come here, you !
You backstabbing boy bitch !
You are never, never seeing her again !
Do you hear me ?
You stay away from that London hog, or I'll put fishhooks in your nipples and fly you off the Chrysler Building !
You got that ?
Why do you make me do this to you ?
But Lorraine's just so much fun.
And I love my accent when I'm with her.
It's so bleedin' 'ard to stay 'way.
So what ?
You just met this woman, and Karen's been with you for thousands of dollars.
The damn Brit gets me, Will.
She sees what's underneath.
Right down to the surface.
So tell me, what is this "gay night" you're having ?
And why isn't this invited ?
It's "game night".
It's nothing like "gay night".
It's a whole evening of interesting games, and someone goes home with a "Suck On It" cup.
Actually, it's quite a bit like "gay night".
You know, it's good you and Grace are doing this.
You guys have been really off lately.
- So you've noticed ?
- I may have read it in a letter somewhere.
Well this is our chance to get it back.
Whenever Grace and I were having problems in the past, game night was always the fix.
Something about lording it over our suburban friends with our mastery of showbiz trivia that really gets to the core of what makes our relationship special.
You know, game night even solved the big fight of '91 ?
Don't you wanna know what that fight was about ?
You know, I trust that it solved it, so Ready ?
And go !
A duck.
A chicken.
An emu.
Uma Thurman.
Shamu.
Okay, no.
Okay.
The sun.
The moon.
Reverend Sun Myung Moon.
An eclipse.
Eclair.
Claire Danes.
A great dane.
Dame Judy Dench.
- Dame Maggie Smith - Enough with the dames !
- No talking !
- Ten seconds.
Okay Oh, a flower !
A gun !
A garden !
Madison Square Garden !
- Time !
- Garden of Eden.
What ?
That's not in Midtown !
I didn't draw "Midtown".
Well, well.
You just move right in, don't ya ?
I guess the guy I paid to hussy-proof this place missed a few spots.
Well, you must be the old Mrs. Walker.
And you were married to Stan as well, weren't you ?
- What's that smell ?
- Stan's favorite perfume.
Dab of roast beef behind each knocker.
Lamb chops work too.
But I'm not here to discuss beauty tips.
Where's my Jackie ?
I know you've got him.
And you know how I know ?
Because I really think so.
Well, you're mistaken.
Now, I believe you know where the door is.
It's the tall, square thing you go through on your way to the plastic surgeon.
Why, you slimy limey !
I've got half a mind to No.
No, I'm going to take the high road.
And not just because I'm high.
I'll be leaving now.
Just going to take one little thing with me.
Come on, Jackie.
You listen to me, little missy.
You may have taken my steer, but I'll be damned if you're gonna take my queer !
Come on !
Jackie, where are you going ?
- But I - Come here.
Jack, no.
Come here.
Come to me.
Come on.
Jackie, come.
Come on.
Oh, that's a good Jackie.
- Come here, Jackie.
- That's a good boy, - Jackie, come here.
- Jackie, come.
Jackie !
Oh, looky here !
All right, stop it !
You're gonna make me piddle !
If you're gonna make me choose, then I choose Karen.
I'm sorry, Lorraine.
I like you, but I love Karen.
We have a special bond.
And let's face it.
It would take four of your boobs to fill one of her cups.
Oh, poodle, do you mean it ?
Of course.
Your boobs are huge !
Mine will be too, a week from Monday.
Come on, Jackie, let's go home, pass out, and forget this ever happened.
And I swear I'll never cheat on you again.
Hey, if Karen dies, I'll totally call you.
Okay, going into the final round, Larry and I are in first, Rob and Ellen, you're second, Will and Grace, you guys are in third.
Or, as we like to call it, last with a big "L" for "loser" !
Hey Hey !
We can still win this, you know.
Yeah, we still have 30 seconds.
We can take it.
That is pressure.
Hope you don't crack !
- See how I got in her head ?
- You've already been in her pants.
Okay, you ready ?
Yeah, I'm ready.
Why would you think I wasn't ready ?
Because earlier, when we were playing charades, and I went like this, you said "parmesan".
You don't realize how important cheese is until it's gone.
All right, you ready ?
Go.
Okay, uh, uh, uh, she she's an actress, her last name is a senator, ran for President.
Gore.
Lesley Gore.
Gore Vidal.
Vidal Sassoon.
- Paul Mitchell.
- No.
- Lost to Nixon.
- Okay, Mondale, - Dukakis, Humphrey.
Holly Humphrey !
- Okay, time out !
- Ah !
You can't call time out !
- Au contraire, my pregnant friend !
The timeout was established after the great bathroom controversy of 1997 !
Each team may call one, and only one, time out, per tournament, as long as a new clue is selected upon their return.
Read your rule book !
Come on, Grace !
Guys, he's right.
And we're sitting in the wrong order.
Here, you need to be over here What happened to you ?
Do you know what it means if they beat us in there tonight ?
It means they're gonna look at us with the same mix of pity and disgust that we do them, and I'm not about to let that happen !
I mean I mean - Will We've lost it.
- What ?
Whatever it is we had that connection.
That thing that made us us.
It's just it's not there anymore.
Sure it is.
It it it it's - It's really not, is it ?
- No.
And I don't know if it's because I got married, or because we're not living together anymore or what, but it's gone.
It's like we lost our mojo.
Or, in our case, our "homojo".
Get.
Out.
- That is exactly what I said.
- What ?
When ?
- The other day.
To Karen.
- Whoa, slow down.
You did ?
Why didn't you call me ?
I don't know, it was a gay pun.
- It just seemed a little small.
- But that's exactly what we're missing.
We need to check in, and not just about the big important stuff, but the little, trivial things that people really care about.
It was just so much easier when we were living together.
You know, I get an overzealous bikini wax, that's three hours of conversation.
Now, we gotta make an effort.
You gotta call me - if you go off cheese.
- I know You're right.
That that was stupid.
You know, I think I might have called and then hung up.
Still think we're gonna be okay ?
- I think we are.
- Promise ?
Oh, look who's back.
It's the losers.
Losers !
Suck on it !
How's that taste ?
Suck on it !
- We still have a little time left.
- Oh, yeah, three seconds.
And no one can do that.
Not even the great Will and Grace.
Just give him the clue, Blob.
Ready ?
Go !
- Bangs.
- Nancy McKeon.
- When did he ask you to mail this ?
- Yesterday.
Read it, read it, read it.
"And though I've never written one of these fan letters before, Justin" "I just want to wish you all the luck in the world on your solo career".
"Sincerely yours, Will Truman "!
- What are you guys reading ?
- Nothing.

{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Karen, what's wrong ?
You've hardly touched your muffin.
Oh, honey, c'mon.
Since Stan and I split I've done nothing but touch my muffin.
Ugh, now I don't even want it.
I don't know what it is.
Everywhere I go, I see Stan.
In the thick ankles of a bakery clerk.
In the sagging breasts of a bus driver.
Even in the eyes of a fat baby.
Wow, Karen He was a really fat man, wasn't he ?
He sure was, Jackie.
Well, Karen, maybe our little girls' night tomorrow will help you take your mind off it.
- You're gonna have a girls' - No.
Wait, are you sure that's tomorrow night ?
Lemme check my book.
I've got a cute little doodle of me hanging from a rafter.
Yeah, that's it.
Girls' night.
It's my last chance to hang with my girlfriends before Leo gets back on Saturday.
'Cause once he's home, I ain't talkin' to you bitches.
Well You know what, Joan ?
That sounds swell, count me in.
Hey, I'll even bring some of my old 45s.
Ooh, and maybe my new.
38.
Oh, oh.
Will ?
I forgot my wallet.
Can you get this ?
I'll get the next five.
Yeah.
Then we'll be all caught up.
C'mon, Jack, we should probably go too I'll walk you.
That's okay I went before I left.
Well, that's good 'cause I left the plastic bag at home.
Your job !
You have a job.
It's time to go to work.
Again ?
I just worked, like last Tuesday.
Jack, you charge your acting students money.
You have an obligation to show up and make them regret that.
I get this one.
- You realize that's my wallet.
- Yeah, I got it.
Okay, people, who left their dog tied up with no food, no water and a Willie Nelson bandana ?
Well, like, whoever you are you don't deserve a dog.
That's why I let him go.
The things you've gotta do to get a seat in this dump.
Oh, my god, do you know who that is ?
That's my old babysitter.
- Sissy ?
- What-y ?
It's me Jack McFarland.
- No way.
- Way !
- For real ?
- Real !
- Get out of town !
- Town !
Well, I think I can leave you two to your Mensa meeting.
So, um, like, you always seemed like one of those people who had the brains and the looks to do anything they put their mind to - What, what amazing things have you been doing ?
- Still babysitting.
But now I have my braces off.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 16 Women and Children First sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Anyway after highschool I realized I had babysat for everyone in the neighborhood.
And it was like, you know "Enough !
I need a change.
" So, I got a Eurail pass and I babysat my way through Europe.
Wow, Sissy, you've lived a glamorous life.
Knock on wood.
Mm, these are delicious.
What are they ?
They are Mint Milanos.
Still with the expensive taste, I see.
So, do you have a boyfriend ?
What about that guy from the couch ?
Do you still see him ?
You mean Randall ?
Yeah, we had an on again off again thing for years.
You know, it was on and then it was off and then he got married and it was on again.
- More tea ?
- Please.
God, look at you You are so grown up.
Did you ever dream that one day you would be sitting in your own apartment, drinking tea ?
You know what, Sissy ?
I did.
But not with you and not with tea and definitely not in my own apartment.
Oh, you know what ?
I better scooteroo.
I'm between jobs and I really should use my downtime.
I'm way behind on my friendship bracelets.
Wait, Sissy.
Do you have to go ?
Well, I thought you said that you were teaching a class tonight.
Yeah, but I don't wanna.
Work's no fun.
I wanna stay here and lay with you, like we used to.
Wait a minute.
What if this was your next job ?
What if you were my babysitter again ?
- I don't know, Jack.
- I could pay you !
Okay.
I am so excited you guys are finally meeting.
I'll get drinks.
- So, Julie, are you married ?
- Yeah.
He's an actor.
Huh, well, "actor.
" He did four student films last year and played Aladdin at the mall.
What's yours do ?
Cleans his ears with his car keys.
And he's an accountant.
Yeah, I led with the interesting one.
Okay, bitches, let's get this lady love-in started.
Who's up first ?
And, yum.
A hottie grows in Brooklyn.
Karen, it's not that kind of girls' night.
She's harmless, really.
But just for fun, lock the door when you got to the bathroom.
Oh, relax, Grace.
I know how to do this.
I've been in a sweat lodge with Candi Bergen and Penny Marshall.
Well, not a sweat lodge so much as Penny's Aerostar.
So what are we drinkin' about ?
Oh, the usual.
Rob's boring, and it's his fault I'm fat.
At least he works.
The only thing my husband did last year is add "Southern accent" to his resume.
Oh, you wanna play this game ?
My half-ton husband spent met some hussy in the cafeteria.
Now they're shacked up at my mansion sharing the bed we used to make rabid love in.
If you're playing "whose husband is worse" with Karen don't play for money.
She's still collecting from Linda Hussein.
C'mon, Grace.
Tell us.
What bugs you about Leo ?
- Nothing, he's perfect.
- C'mon give us somethin' !
Likes to wear your lipstick to bed, cries in the shower, likes to kiss I'm sorry.
It's great.
Married four months and still no problems.
- Unless you consider constant lovin' a problem.
- Oh, this is gross.
Get her !
Whoo !
That's Leo.
This is the time he calls to say he loves me.
My husband calls the same time every day too.
Maybe one of these days I'll pick up.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Did I miss girls' night ?
Honey, you missed "girls' night" by about a hundred years.
Shut your hole you drunken doughnut.
Oh, my mood stabilizer party mix.
Uppers, downers and candy corn.
And don't tell my doctor, he's trying to get me off sugar.
- Everything okay, Grace ?
- Um, no.
That was Leo.
Uh, he's not coming back for another five weeks.
Why ?
What happened ?
Um, I don't know.
Uh, one of the doctors there ate some bad pork.
or was eaten by a wild pig Um, all I know is that he He volunteered to stay longer.
Here, honey have some party mix.
You'll feel better.
Or worse.
That's what I love about party mix, you never know.
C'mon, Jack !
The movie starts in half an hour.
I don't wanna miss the previews.
Then I'll never know what books have been made into movies that are now available on video.
We're gonna need to use our indoor voice.
I just put Jack down for his nap and I don't need you out here yelling like the wild man from Borneo.
We're, like, 40.
So, do you think you could stop talking to me like I'm a cub scout ?
We're going to the movies.
- Oh ?
What movie ?
- The new Vin Diesel thing.
I don't think so.
I hear it's violent, with a strong homoerotic subtext.
- Why do you think we're going ?
- Sissy ?
My blanky fell off the bed !
I gotta go.
Bye.
So, it's another month.
I mean, if anything it's good news.
'Cause now, I have another few weeks to do these dishes in the sink.
I think there's peanut butter in the bottom of this glass.
- So what'd you tell him, Grace ?
- I told him it was fine.
What else was I gonna say ?
He's a million miles away.
- You did the right thing.
- I did, right ?
You know, since we had our second baby I've been wanting to take a fork and just stab Rob in the balls with it.
But I'm not about to bother Rob with that at the office.
Julie, do you think I did the right thing ?
Yeah.
You never tell guys what you're feeling.
Let them figure it out on their own that you hate them.
Thanks.
Rosario ?
Yeah, dress slutty shut up.
That's my motto.
Great.
Okay.
Thank you.
Guess that settles that.
So, girls' night.
Anyone with a uterus drinks free !
Hold on there, red.
Don't you wanna hear what I have to say about this ?
Well, Karen Come on.
What ?
Well, you're you.
And ?
And Come on.
I see.
No, no, no.
That's all right.
Honey, I understand.
You think that just because my marriage failed that I have nothing to offer.
You have things to offer.
You would be the first person I'd call, if I wanted to hurt an orphan's feelings.
Well, I know more about marriage than any of these girls ever will.
And if you wanted my opinion, I would tell you to grow a set pick up the phone and call that no-good do-good husband of yours and tell him how you feel.
That you're sitting here, home alone, pissed off while he's out there giving free boob jobs to hyenas !
But you don't care what I think so I'm outta here !
And I'm taking this with me.
I'm certainly not leaving $3,000 worth of snacks where I'm not appreciated.
Yes, the files just arrived.
But, Mr. Stein, there is no way I can get all this done by Monday.
I do too have a life.
I In fact, I've got plans with my friend Jack tonight.
But he's napping at the moment, so Hello ?
I thought we were going to the movies.
I was looking forward to going to see Vin Diesel.
I heard he's got a new facial expression.
I came to get you.
But that crazy lady with the rockin' body sent me away.
Jack, what are you doing with her ?
She is in my employ.
I am a very busy man and I need a staff.
What exactly is her position ?
She's my, uh She helps me with my, um You know, she sometimes she sometimes - She's your babysitter, isn't she ?
- Yes !
She's my babysitter.
So what if she is ?
There's nothing wrong with that.
What does she do ?
Feed you, change you, pat you on the back to burp you ?
Only when Mr. Gas Bubble's shy.
Oh, my god, I was joking !
This is the creepiest thing I've ever heard.
- Well, that's what babysitters do.
- For babies !
What are you implying, Will ?
That there's something odd about my relationship with Sissy ?
You're an adult, Jack.
Well, I don't wanna be an adult anymore !
It's very hard !
Sissy Sissy takes care of me.
She makes me feel good.
She cuts the crusts off my sammiches.
Jack, you're a grown man.
A grown man does not need a babysitter.
How dare you call me a grown man !
I'm sorry, was my attempt to draft a 1 billion-dollar corporate merger keeping "wittle Jackie" awake ?
You know, you shouldn't make that face.
It might freeze that way.
Look, William.
I don't want to be the cause of any tension between you and Jack.
Do you think maybe I could come in and we could talk about it ?
I'm incredibly busy I don't see how that's possible.
- I make killer s'mores.
- I'll preheat the oven.
No, Leo, I'm not asking you to come home.
I just want you to understand that I'm upset.
That these, these decisions affect me too and I want us to make them together.
All right ?
I love me too.
Grace Hey, you came back.
Well I got all the way home and realized I forgot my maid.
I usually keep an extra under the mat, but You were right.
- It was better to tell him.
- Well, I'm glad.
So how'd it go ?
Well, I could tell Leo felt bad.
That felt good.
You should let me help you more, honey.
I know a few things and I care about you.
Now let's get back in there.
C'mon, we got a room full of lovely ladies.
Let's put on some music and get those tops off.
You do know that it's not that kind of girls' night ?
We'll see.
- God, I love s'mores.
- Why don't you marry 'em ?
Don't make me laugh.
No time to laugh.
Look at all this law stuff.
No way I'm ever gonna get finished.
Well, you know, that's one way of looking at it.
But there is another way.
Inch by inch Foot by foot It won't take long with the homework song You do one task That's all we ask You do one more and you get another s'more Well, when you say it like that it does seem totally doable.
- Now, c'mon.
You try.
- Oh, I don't know.
Come on.
Case by case Tort by tort Sign and stamp Hey, I finished one report Foot by foot Mile by mile Perhaps I should try the McKendrick file So grown men don't need babysitters, huh ?
She's not my babysitter.
She's just singing me a little song to help me with my casework.
We learned that in law school.
Oh, would you just admit it ?
It feels good to be taken care of.
- Nice work, Sissy.
- Hey, it was your plan smarty-pants.
Wait You two set me up ?
And it was easy.
You're a whore for a s'more.
Hey, there is no comparison between what happened here and the sick relationship you two have.
And blow Thank you.
The difference is I don't need it.
What are you saying ?
- I believe you heard me.
- What's your point ?
- I think you got it.
- What are you implying ?
What I said outright.
You're a Sissy-holic.
So what if, what if I am hooked on my babysitter ?
It's a hard-candy world out there and sometimes this fella needs a little break.
So if I have to pay someone $4 or $5 an hour to help me get through it then it's worth it.
- Actually, Jack, I make $40 an hour.
- Good-bye, Sissy.
- I don't need you anymore.
- What are you saying ?
Sis I think he's right.
I think I maybe need to outgrow you.
Damn it.
Why does everyone outgrow me ?
I mean I know being a babysitter is all flashy and ooh-la-la.
But you don't know the heartbreak behind it.
The kids grow up and I never see 'em again.
You know, but then I ran into you.
And I thought maybe there are some things that don't change.
Well, Sissy, we can still hang out and be friends and spend time together.
- I mean, you don't have to charge me.
- Yeah, I do.
I need the money.
I'm into Casual Corner for, like, 12 grand.
I understand.
It's been fun and I guess it had to end sometime.

{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
So anyway, when Leo got the call from Doctors Without Borders, he didn't wanna go, but I insisted.
And if that makes me a hero, so be it.
You're the hero in a lotta your stories.
Thank you.
So, now he's in Africa Oh, you're gonna love this.
He was responsible And it made him insane with malaria.
But if I could just get serious for a moment.
I really feel like things Five, four, three, two Oh, Will, there you are.
I'm sorry I'm late.
The cast of Urinetown is after me.
Simple misunderstanding.
How's my hair ?
I told them I wanted it to look "second-day-dirty".
Delicious, your ears have never looked better.
- Why my ears ?
- Learn to take a compliment.
Here's the bill for "Red McChatty" back there.
Get the next one shampooed, I'm gonna go out back and smoke whatever's in the bottom of my pocket.
Actually, your next one, Barry, isn't here yet.
But we'll be making his decisions for him.
Yeah, he's 35.
He just came out of the closet.
We've been working with him for the last few weeks to get him ready for the HRC Gala tonight.
I hear what you're saying : "Tonight, are you mad ?
He should've had his hair cut a week ago, it would have time to set, that's Hair 101".
Yeah, but we had a dilemma.
You see, his body was in worse shape than his hair, so we had to send him to a fat farm.
He thought he was going to a spa.
Isn't that great ?
Why is everyone talking to me today ?
Um Anyway, this is how we want his hair cut, okay ?
- Chunky, but not too chunky.
- PC, but not too PC.
And gay, but not too gay.
Yeah, we want him to be cruised in Chelsea, but not beat up in Brooklyn.
Oh, crap, here she comes !
Hey.
So, how's my hair look ?
Delicious.
Your ears have never looked better.
Thank you.
And you two look great.
And I'm not saying that just because I feel so good about myself right now.
Well, you know, it's a big night.
Every a-list gay will be there.
You know, the creme de la creme of the creme de la femme.
And I am not leaving that benefit until I get serious with at least five guys.
Hey Hey, the Human Rights Campaign is not some silly dating service.
It's an essential advocacy group for gay and lesbian issues.
How did that sound ?
Too smart to land a hot dumb guy ?
Careful with those tips, I want them nice and pointy in case I have to stab someone in the neck.
My, my, my, my, my.
If it isn't my dear friend, Karen Walker.
So nice to see you.
Why, Beverley Leslie, if you'd sit on a phone book, it'd be nice to see you too.
Oh, honey, I haven't had a chance to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your poor wife, Crystal.
Is she any better ?
Well, it was a dicey, experimental surgery.
But those Dominican doctors said if she wanted to look 70 again, she'd just have to try it.
And yet, she lived through it.
You must have been devastated.
Oh, I'll survive.
But poor you Your husband, Stanley Walker, dumps you for a younger hootchie mama who serves soft potatoes.
He went from smashed to mashed.
I have to laugh to keep from crying.
Will, Jack, this whole day has been a disaster.
D.I. Saster.
The plane from the S & M camp you call a spa took off a half-hour late.
So what do I do ?
I eat a muffin.
Sure, I spit most of it into a trash can like they taught me, but, I accidentally swallowed a few crumbs, and god help me maybe a nut.
Now I'm late.
Oh !
I look awful !
My hair is never gonna look good.
It's stringy and ugly, and I'm fat !
Yikes, that was a little much.
What a drama queen.
- Our little boy's growing up.
- I'm so proud.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 17 Fagmalion, Part 3 Bye Bye Beardy sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Barry, it's okay you didn't like Broken Hearts Club or Kiss Me, Guido.
Let me tell you a little secret, that we try to keep within the community.
Gay movies suck.
But, until the laws change, we're still obligated to go see 'em.
- Will ?
- In here !
Look, don't sweat it.
Call me anytime.
I'll see you tonight.
Okay, huge news huge !
Barry has decided to shave his beard.
- That's it ?
- Are you kidding ?
His beard is his last connection to his closeted life.
Well, unless he's gonna shave it off with his feet, I still don't see the bigness.
Trust me, this is a huge event in his life.
And it should be marked in some meaningful way.
Damn, I wish there was time to bake peanut butter cookies.
Can we change the subject to something important ?
What am I wearing to this party tonight ?
Okay, dressing for these things, it's always a fine line.
How do I turn on the gay guys without arousing the lesbians ?
Heh.
Barry's got a new tux.
He didn't want me to see it until tonight Wanted to surprise me.
Isn't that adorable ?
Yeah, cute as a box of babies.
Okay, this one's slitty.
This one's slutty.
This one's titty.
This one's butty.
Okay, here's some accessories and lingerie.
Mix and match, enjoy.
- This is gonna kill you.
- I doubt it.
Barry went to Barney's to pick out his first gym bag.
Can you imagine what that was like ?
I can And it's not very interesting.
Man, the way you're going on about him, it's like you You like him.
What ?
Barry ?
Come on, Barry's not my type.
Don't give me that.
I know all the signs.
You talk about him constantly.
You wanna bake cookies for him.
Your face lights up with a huge grin - every time his name is mentioned.
- No, it doesn't.
Oh, for crying out loud, this is ridiculous.
I just walked up a flight of stairs.
What, did they put this here just so that the queens could make an entrance ?
No And don't talk like that.
This organization i dedicated to breaking down those kind of stereotypes.
Hello, girls !
Dolly's back in town.
I'm a-go working Somewhere, Rip Taylor is saying, "Now, that's faggy".
- So whatcha doin' ?
Waitin' for your date ?
- Barry is not my date.
Yet, you admit you love him.
If I care for him, it is only in the way that a mentor cares for his student.
You know, the way the way, in My Fair Lady, Henry Higgins cared for Eliza Doolittle.
Henry Higgins loved Eliza.
He grew accustomed to her face.
That's love.
Oh, please, if there was any love in that story, it was between Higgins and Pickering.
You're nuts.
Two confirmed bachelors in their late fifties whose idea of a good time is dressing Audrey Hepburn in fabulous Edith Head outfits ?
Oh, they were gay, my friend.
They were gay.
Ladies, gentlemen, and undecided I'd like you to meet someone.
He's been plucked, coiffed, buffed, and fluffed.
May I present to you My cousin Barry !
Wow, he's hot !
The final test, Grace finds him attractive.
He's gay, all right.
Where's Will ?
I haven't seen him all night.
Oh, you know Will likes to do his own thing at these events.
He's probably sucking down ten crab cakes before he makes a desperate move on some ugly waiter.
- Hi.
I'm Byron - Ah, sorry !
He's not interested.
Move along.
Buh-bye, Byron.
Why did you do that ?
He seemed great.
You just rejected one of the hottest guys here.
Everyone will be talking about it.
Look around.
Your mystique level just went up, like, 158 points.
Wow, 42 more, I can upgrade to business gay.
Heh-heh.
Funny.
But when you say something witty at a party, you should always appear bored, take a sip of your drink, and look away.
That way, it'll seem like it happens all the time.
Par example : Though two rights might make a wrong, a rolling butt gathers no moss.
I see But that wasn't really a joke, was it ?
It was pretty much just a random selection of words.
Exactly My four-fingered friend.
Hey, some party, huh ?
I just saw two guys meet, marry, split up, and then get back together again for the sake of the Eames furniture.
It's amazing, I've never seen so many good-looking guys in one room.
You can include yourself in that, mister.
- Doesn't he look good, Will ?
- Yeah, he he looks great.
Yeah.
Check out his pecs.
It's like he's got a granite bra on.
- Come on, feel 'em.
- Come on, Will, objectify me.
No I got crab cake on my fingers.
I need to get a crab cake removal system.
There's some cute guys here, huh ?
Too bad they're all 'mos.
Ha ha ha It doesn't really matter to me, I'm a lesbian.
Oh Honey, we're all lesbians when the right guy isn't around, huh ?
Now, I wanna buy a little somethin' for my Jackie.
Somethin' shiny but non-toxic, 'cause you know it's just gonna end up in his mouth.
You don't buy things.
It's a silent auction.
You write down your bid.
We'll announce the winners at the end of the night, and the money goes to help enact hate-crime laws and battle prejudice.
Oh And they say lesbians aren't funny.
Here's an exciting item, uh a gourmet chef comes to your house and prepares a romantic dinner for two.
Yeah, I hear ya loud and clear, coach.
But, uh, I just got out of a relationship, and I think it's a little early, okay ?
But I think Jackie might like it.
Not so fast.
I want that dinner too.
Well, what are you doing here, you frosted mini-wheat ?
Now, you know, the plight of the homosexual is a cause dear to my wife Crystal's heart.
So I plan on taking her money and purchasing that dinner for me and my business associate, Benji.
Oh, I love gay events.
Just got my eyebrows waxed in the men's room.
Meanwhile, in the ladies room, I learned how to rewire a lamp.
- What's with the puss ?
- How could you do this to me ?
Why would you tell me that I like Barry ?
- Because you do like him.
- That's not the point.
I was perfectly happy not knowing how I felt.
Now I feel all all raw and self-conscious, like like a stewardess without makeup.
- Thanks a lot, Grace.
- Stop it.
You always do this.
Instead of allowing yourself to feel Oh, I don't know, excited or happy or vulnerable, - you just go straight to anger.
- No, I don't.
Oh, really ?
How do you feel about the ending of Titanic ?
Oh, that was just stupid !
Of course they hit an iceberg !
Two guys in the crow's nest, a ship that big ?
Come on, Will, it's okay.
You can like him.
I do.
I like him so much.
Look at him.
- Ask him out.
- Nah, nah, I don't know Okay, you listen to me.
You are a gorgeous man, who is smart, sexy, and kind.
How many deviled eggs did you have ?
Okay, just go up to him, and talk to him, and say what you feel.
- He'd be so lucky to have you.
- I will.
I will.
I gotta go to the men's room.
My eyebrows are too bushy.
Thanks, sweetie.
Yeah, that's okay.
That dinner is mine, you sad, pickled woman !
It's mine, Baby Gap !
All right !
Top that Mrs. Walker.
I can't.
Since Stan left me, I can't throw around money with the same ease that I can throw around you.
- I'm out, you happy now ?
- What kind of human being would I be if I couldn't ring joy from a dear friend's misery ?
Enjoy your dinner.
You're short.
Will.
Will, look at our boy.
Isn't he doing great ?
I'm so proud of us.
We should win an award.
I don't think they give out awards for helping people be gay.
Well unless you count the Tonys.
Look, I gotta go to the little boys room.
My hose is riding up.
- You're wearing pantyhose ?
- No.
Come on.
You go Go keep an eye on Barry.
He doesn't understand how predatory some of these guys can be.
Ooh, excuse me.
I see a defenseless queerling who's wandered away from the flock.
- Why haven't you talked to him yet ?
- I'm intimidated, okay ?
It's like I've I've created a guy that's too hot for me to date.
It's the same reason Dr. Frankenstein didn't date his monster.
What ?
Dr. Frankenstein wasn't a homo.
Oh, really ?
He sewed together a bunch of guys to create the perfect man ?
Wrapped him in linen.
Give him a flat head, so you can set a drink on it.
Dr. Frank was a 'mo, my friend.
He was a 'mo.
- Go.
- No.
- Oh, hey.
Barry, I - Will, you've gotta help keep me away from that auction table.
I'm bidding on things I don't even want.
I know.
I'm up to $300 on lunch and a steam with Jerry Orbach.
Wow, that guy's been checking me out all night.
He's not right for you !
Why ?
Oh, right.
Jack's rule : Never date someone white after labor day.
- I'm gonna go over there.
- Yeah, you know, but But Barry, don't, um Don't listen to his rules, okay.
They're stupid.
Except for that one about waiting half an hour after eating before dating a lifeguard.
But, you know when the right guy is there, - you'll know it.
- I don't know.
Sometimes I feel like I'm never gonna find him.
You will.
He may even be closer than you think.
In fact, um Barry, there's something that I've been meaning to Okay, everybody, listen up.
The silent auction is now officially closed.
Congratulations, we've raised more money here tonight than we ever have before.
We'll start by announcing our first item : A romantic dinner for two, cooked in your very own home.
And the winner is - Karen Walker.
- Wait, wait.
Ho, whoa, what ?
No !
No, no, that's impossible !
- I was the highest bidder.
- You're not the highest anything !
I switched the books on you.
Yeah.
You've just spent a ton of Crystal's money on two front row tickets to see the Indigo Girls.
Benji !
Benji !
Thank you.
Thank you.
Gays rule !
And to show my appreciation, I would like to give my romantic dinner to my best gal pal, Jack McFarland, to share with whoever he wants.
What ?
What ?
I won !
I won !
I won !
Thank you, Karen !
Now, I know the question that's on everybody's lips.
Who will I be sharing this dinner with ?
Who ?
Who, you ?
No.
Who ?
Who ?
Who Anyway, where was I ?
I you know what, I'm just gonna come right out and say it.
Barry - Would you go out - Would you go out with me ?
- Me ?
- You ?
Him ?
I can't believe you're asking me.
Yeah, of course I would go out with you.
Wow, it's just like you said, maybe the right guy was closer than I thought.
And then, we got married.
It was like a fairy tale.
And on the first night of our honeymoon, he said something to me that I have never told anyone.
You're gonna love this was Jewish.
Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Good evening, Barry, and welcome to your date with Jack.
If it goes well, I'll sign it.
Okay.
Um, I brought a bottle of wine.
It's supposedly the finest cabernet from the New Jersey wine country.
Chateau Secaucus.
What are you doing here ?
What ?
Do I need an excuse to see my favorite man in the whole world ?
Leo's out of town, and you're lonely ?
Yeah, I'm bored.
Let's watch the Surgery Channel.
- Comin' in ?
- In a second.
Oh.
Right.
Go out into the hallway to relax.
You know so it doesn't cloud the apartment.
I don't do that.
Neither do I. Let's go in.
What's the rush ?
Okay, wait a second.
Does Jack have his date with Barry tonight ?
Is that tonight ?
I don't think that's tonight.
- Please !
You're totally spying on him.
- I am not.
What kind of a world do you live in, when the only reason people are in a hallway is to either fart or spy ?
Well, if you're not spying, then go into your apartment like a normal person.
Fine.
I will.
Aren't you coming ?
In a second.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 18 Fagmalion, Part 4 The Guy Who Loved Me sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hello ?
Maintenance ?
This is Mrs. Walker in 5319.
I'd like to put my drink on the mantel.
Could you send someone over to move the fireplace ?
Here, Rosie, you try one.
You do it.
I'm not in the mood.
What's the matter, Ro-Ro ?
You've been kinda grumpy all day.
Where's the usual lumber in your step ?
It's this new uniform you got me.
It's too tight, it's itchy, I can barely breathe.
Why, you ingrate.
How dare you complain ?
When I found you, you were boxing donkeys for money.
You pulled me out of business school, you tipsy witch.
- I ain't wearing it.
- Oh.
Why not ?
Seems perfectly fine to me.
Look, I can do everything you do in it.
I can eat.
And I can sleep.
Oh, wait.
Watch this.
And I can steal.
Can you walk through doors ?
No.
Hey.
Hey, let me in.
Let me in.
Hello.
I didn't know there was a new maid working on this floor.
- What ?
- I've never seen someone so beautiful.
How long have you been working here ?
Two weeks.
Mm.
Mm-hmm, nutty.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Oak-y Mm, with just a hint of embalming fluid.
Hey, just, uh, taking out the trash.
Anybody got any trash in here ?
Trash ?
Uh, no, we're good.
Hey.
Where's the chef ?
I thought you were gonna have a chef cook you dinner.
Uh, we sent him home.
He wasn't attractive.
- I thought he was really cute.
- That's what I mean.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, hey, is that salad ?
God, I'm a fan of salad.
Well, what kind of lettuce isn't in this ?
It's fantastic.
What are you guys doin' ?
We're on a date !
Oh, my God.
This is so embarrassing.
I-I please, just don't let me interrupt.
- Excuse me.
- You wanna go out with me ?
- Uh, kind of already on a date.
- I don't mean now, but how quickly can you wrap things up here ?
Excuse me.
Tartlets for two.
It's okay, I was just leaving.
What do you say ?
You just asked him out on a date while he's on a date with me ?
Will Truman !
That is despicable !
And totally one of my moves.
Out in the hall now !
Rosie !
I just met the most incredible man.
Are you sure you just didn't lean into the doorknob again ?
No, no.
He's like a dream, like that place I go to to work.
Engineering.
Here to check the thermostat.
Oh, that's him.
Rosie, quick !
Do I look as bad as you ?
- What's going on ?
- Well He thinks I'm a maid.
You have to pretend you're me.
Okay, I'll take out my heart and sell my soul to the devil.
We don't he time for that.
Here, put this on.
Hurry, hurry.
Mrs. Walker ?
That's right.
Shut your mouth, maid !
My jewelry might fall out.
What a monster.
Who taught her to talk to another human being like that ?
I have no idea.
Of course, you don't.
We're different from them, you and I. The rich.
They think they're so much better than we are.
But we have one thing they'll never have.
Rickets ?
- Pride.
- Pride !
The true pride that comes of a hard day's work, of having friends, not possessions.
Of measuring your accomplishments in love given, not dollars spent.
Dollars - Will you go out with me tonight ?
- Yes !
C'mon, d-do you even like him ?
I like how I look when I'm next to him.
And he's, he's not as cumbersome as carrying a pomeranian.
Wow, you've, you've fallen harder than I thought.
Look, why don't we just ask Barry who he's more interested in ?
Okay, and whoever he says, that's who gets him.
- Okay, fine.
- Good.
Now, this is a very delicate situation.
I hope we can handle it - with mutual respect and dignity.
- As do I. You know the best part about dating men ?
A lot more slapstick.
Okay, Barry, I know this is this seems weird, but we got a problem.
See, I like you.
Oh, sure, now that you're hot.
But remember when he turned you down before, when you were hideous ?
No.
It's just that I now I've gotten to know you better and I want to spend time with you.
- I want us to date.
- But you can't date both of us, because we're best friends, and I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with Will, who wears a wig and a truss.
So who are you gonna choose ?
Me, who genuinely cares for you and really believes that we could make something great ?
Or me.
Try that.
I don't know what to say.
I like both you guys, you know, in different ways.
But I guess if I had to pick one of you, it would have to be Will.
Yes !
Yes !
What ?
You're spectacular.
I'm the envy of every maintenance man in this hotel.
Today I walk with the pride of a bellman.
Would you look at this waste ?
Jerks in the penthouse ordered all this food and didn't even touch it.
- You guys want it ?
- Oh, yeah No !
We do not need their castoffs.
Here.
It's humble, but honest.
Oh.
Thank you.
It's thoughtful, but dry.
I'll get you some mayo.
The mayo of the people.
I've never seen a maid like you before.
Where you from exactly ?
Oh.
I'm from Margaritaville.
So, you excited about your big date ?
Are you kidding ?
I'm so confident about this that I've already signed us up for couples counseling.
Hello.
Nice shirt.
Somewhere, a ballerina is shivering.
Hey, Grace.
What are you doin' tonight ?
'Cause I'm suddenly in the market for a new best friend.
Here, let's see if we click.
I'll say something witty, and then you say something back.
Okay ?
Let's go.
I'm very handsome.
- Jack, you're acting like a baby.
- Oh, how droll.
Let's never be apart.
You're being ridiculous.
Okay, he chose me over you.
Do you think that makes me happy ?
Stop smiling.
It's unnatural on you.
A smile on you is like a nice pair of legs on a chimp.
C'mon.
I don't feel any better about this than you do.
- Stop it !
- Jack, he isn't laughing at you.
He's just laughing, with me, at you.
Well, I'm glad this is amusing both of you.
Go on, laugh.
Laugh at the sad, gay clown !
I curse your date !
A pox on both your entrees.
Yeah, made the right choice.
Karen, are you okay ?
You haven't been to work in three days.
Things are really gettin' done.
It's freakin' me out.
Karen ?
Hello Just because I'm the new girl, they think they can give me the cart with the bum wheel !
And I'm short two shower caps and a sewing kit, and you know that's comin' out of my pay !
Housekeeping.
Okay, here's a personality I've never met before.
Thought I knew all of them.
What's your name ?
Actually, I'm kinda glad you're here.
I could use some advice.
Well, um, first of all You dust with the feather end, not the stick end.
Hm.
Better.
Listen.
I have this friend who lives at The Palace Hotel.
And she and her maid Ro Mosario switched places so that my friend could pose as a poor, but honest chambermaid to woo a hunky maintenance man.
Now my friend's fallen in love with him, and she's afraid that if she tells him the truth, he'll leave her.
Hey, hands off my friend's cart !
So, you're afraid that a poor janitor might not love you because you're rich ?
Not me, my friend !
Well, the way I see it is, if the guy really loves her, he'll look past the money and see a pure heart the size of a marble.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Thanks, honey.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to turn down the beds and put a mint on each pi Hey, where are my mints ?
I don't know Can someone help this man ?
I think he's looking for a copy of Boyfriend Stealer Weekly.
C'mon, Jack.
You're not still upset about me and Barry ?
Okay, I guess I'll just have to stop seeing him.
I mean, no guy is worth jeopardizing our friendship.
Reluctant pivot, inquisitive head tilt.
I mean, sure, we've had fantastic dates all week, talked and laughed, had feisty debates and comfortable silences, feisty silences and comfortable debates, silently debated the comforts of feistiness, but if our being together is gonna upset you in any way, I'll give him up.
- Good.
I think you should.
- No way !
Are you crazy ?
I'm really into Barry.
He's the first guy in a long time I've felt this way about, who's not, you know, an arrow-shooting elf from Lord of the Rings.
So just get over it and get happy for me.
No !
If you continue dating Barry, I will never forgive you.
You look older when you're angry.
You're a gorgeous couple.
When are you seeing him again ?
Tomorrow night.
Although, I was kind of thinking of dropping by his place right now and surprising him with, I don't know, Chinese food.
- You think I should ?
- Abs-and-pecks-olutely.
It's very romantic.
And moo goo gai pan is the food of love.
Really ?
Why do you think there's so many Chinese people ?
Thanks, Jack.
You're the best.
Ah Bemused brow raise, shake of head.
Hey, I brought some Chinese food over.
I though maybe we could, uh order a pizza.
That sounds really nice, but, um I kind of have plans tonight.
- Oh ?
Well, what kind of plans ?
- Kind of a date.
Oh.
Okay.
Um Uh, you know wh I'm just gonna say this.
I like you, Barry.
I don't wanna date anybody else, and I I was kinda hoping you didn't want to either.
But, you were the one who said I should play the field for a while, that I won't know if I met the right guy until I see what's out there.
You wanna know what's out there ?
Half a million guys in lycra tank tops going, "Girlfriend "!
Yeah, you could play the field for a while, but what you're eventually gonna find out is that Well I'm the right guy.
So skip the middle part.
Forget the dating around.
I'm, I'm mid to to early 30 mish.
I've done this already.
- But I haven't.
- Right.
So now you don't have to.
But I want to.
Look, Will, you're great, but I've only been out a month.
And I've only been good-looking a week.
I need to see what's out there.
I wanna do a share on Fire Island.
I wanna see Cher in Vegas.
I want a drag name.
Something like "Kitty Litter".
So, y-you you don't wanna I'm sorry.
Look, um, I don't have to leave for a bit.
Stay.
I'll um, I'll heat up this Order a pizza.
Yeah, you know, I should, um, I should go.
So, I'll see you around.
You're unlike any woman I've ever met.
So good, so real.
I know it's only been a short while, but I feel as if I know everything there is to know about you.
- Me too.
- I love you, Lopita.
Wait.
No.
This isn't right.
Or is it the rightest thing ever ?
No.
It's all a lie.
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm not good or real.
I'm evil and imaginary.
And I'm rich.
Filthy rich !
- I don't understand.
- I'm not a maid.
I'm a snoot, a swell, a fat cat.
Look at these soft, unlined breasts.
They've never done an honest day's work in their lives.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I've been looking at your breasts.
My name is Karen Walker, and I'm the opposite of everything you stand for.
I'm uptown, you're downtown.
I'm upstairs, you're downstairs.
I'm uppers I'm downers.
Do you think that there's any way that you could ever love someone as rich and powerful as me ?
- Sure.
- Really ?
Of course.
You're my soul mate.
I love you, rich or poor.
Oh, darling.
I've waited my whole life for this moment.
- Let's celebrate.
This calls for champagne.
- I don't drink.
It can't work.
We're from two different worlds.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Oh, Will.
You're hot early.
I mean, you're here, handsome.
I'm sorry.
Would you like some sex in your coffee ?
You know, you learn a lot you get here early.
For instance, I was happy to learn that the woman who vacuums and the guy who empties the trash are having an affair.
I was not so happy to learn it was on my desk.
Do you want me to confirm your dinner reservation with Barry ?
No, cancel it.
Barry and I are over.
You can cancel the weekend in Key West too.
I think I'd look a little pathetic in the pool having a splash fight with a blowup doll.
You know, I love Key West.
Yeah, well, pack your bags.
I'll bring the bubbly.
- Oh, God, I can't breathe !
- No, Connie, I can't - All right, I'm here.
- Terrific.
Everybody from The Matrix called.
They want their coat back.
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay after the whole Barry thing.
- For the record, I never liked him.
- You liked him.
- I did, but he was no good for you.
- He was perfect for me.
He kinda was.
Look, I'm fine.
We we had like, what, two dates ?
I spend more time on hold trying to vote for "American Idol".
I guess you're right.
I mean, it's not like you were planning weekend trips with him.
Yeah, that'd be pathetic.
Well, just so you know, I'm here for you.
- Just like you're always here for me.
- What do you need ?
I want to borrow your apartment this afternoon.
I'm making a sexy video to send to Leo.
Why do you have to use my apartment ?
I want to be dirty in a clean place.
Well, just make sure you're clean in your dirty place.
Truman.
I want you to go help Short Margaret with her depositions and Black Margaret with her appeal.
They're in over their heads, especially Short Margaret.
Would you do that for me Gay Will ?
- See ya.
- Who are you ?
Oh, I was just leaving.
And, uh, by the way, - Barry wasn't really that cute.
- He was totally cute.
He was.
It was a major loss.
Stay strong.
Sorry about that, Mr. Stein.
I was sort of dating someone, and it didn't work out.
It's no big deal.
She's just very protective Mr. Stein, what are you doing ?
I recognize heartache.
My wife just left me.
Well, it was 15 years ago, but I'm reliving it because of these new meds I'm taking.
And if I remember correctly from our last uncomfortable hug, that's a new shampoo too.
Come on, let's go have a drink.
Sir, it's 8:00 in the morning.
We'll have some eggs too.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 19 Sex, Losers and Videotape sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Hi, Leo.
It's me, Grace.
I thought I would make you a sexy video.
And why am I making this sexy video in Will's apartment ?
Because things could get messy.
Ew, sour strawberry, sour strawberry.
Oh, bad angle.
Hi, lover.
What the hell ?
Jack, what are you doing here ?
I live here, when Will's at work.
Well, get out.
I'm making a sexy videotape for Leo, and I'm not going to do it with you in the room.
Sweetie, baby, cookie, honey What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'.
Hi, Leo, I'm back.
I love to love you, baby Oh And cut.
Eating and singing ?
Why don't you just sit on the toilet and pick at your feet ?
Excuse me, I think I know how to turn a man on.
I certainly didn't pass my driver's test by learning how to parallel park.
Sugar You're tryin' a little hard.
- I am trying to be sexy.
- But you don't have to try.
You're naturally sexy.
I mean, just like now.
- Really ?
- Well, not now.
You know what the problem is ?
You're too self-conscious.
You need to come to my acting class.
I've helped a lot of people lose their inhibitions and get in touch with their sexuality.
And by theirs, I often mean mine.
Forget it.
I'm not taking tips from a man whose most notable credit is Shakespeare in the Pants.
A'ight, suit yourself.
But you watch that tape.
I think you'll find yourself a little stiff.
And you'll be the only one !
I really liked Barry.
Why didn't he like me ?
Will, love is mysterious.
It's just like my wife always used to say.
"Stein, you're needy, pathetic, and a rotten lover".
- That doesn't make me feel any better.
- How do you think it made me feel ?
It's just that he's someone I could really see having a future with.
I wanted to come home to him every day and say, "Hey, honey, what's for dinner "?
And he'd say, "I don't feel like cooking.
Let's go out".
And I'd say, "We always go out.
Put down the scotch and pick up a wisk.
Why are you crying now "?
It's not sexy, but it's what I grew up with.
Now, when you say "he", you're talking about a man.
- Yes.
- But Barry is a girl.
No he's a man.
That's why they call you "Gay Will" !
Oh, hey, look who it is.
It's Will and Grace.
No, no, Karen.
Karen, Karen, this is Mr. Stein of Doucette and Stein.
Mr. Stein, this is Karen Walker of drunk and delusional.
A pleasure to meet you.
Smitty, the usual.
So what are we celebrating ?
Well, I'm afraid you've stumbled on a bit of a lonely hearts club.
Will and I were just swapping stories about lost loves.
Me and my wife, he and his gal.
Guy.
Well, deal me in.
I've got a lifetime membership to the losers club.
I've been dumped by one-ton billionaires, heads of state, and every member of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young, but I'm not naming names.
What's so great about another person, huh ?
All they do is manhandle your boobs and eat all the ham.
Yeah, and get hair gel on your pillow and rearrange your bedside figurines.
And cut your ties in half and make you call yourself "Nancy".
A toast love stinks.
- How sad.
- Hear, hear.
Attention, please !
Attention !
Please take your seats.
Class is in session.
Thought for the day : Though the eyes are the windows to your soul, the zipper is the window to your underwear.
Who is prepared to perform ?
- I am.
- Ah, Joanne.
Always with your hand in the air.
One day that hand's gonna be up in the air on Broadway.
Perhaps in a musical, perhaps just hailing a cab.
All right, what do you got ?
I did some preparation for my audition this afternoon.
- I'd like to get some thoughts.
- That's what we're here for.
And action.
Thanks, Imodium.
All right.
Now, are you gonna wear your hair up or down ?
Because you're trying to reach people with cramps, bloating, and explosive diarrhea.
That, to me, says down.
- All right, now - Hi.
I'm I'm sorry to interrupt.
Jack, can I talk to you just for a sec ?
Well, Grace, whatever you have to say, you can say it in front of my class.
We expose ourselves to each other every single day.
Ooh, that reminds me.
Russell, take off your shirt, and tell your lawyer to stop calling me.
And scene.
Nice work.
Um, well, Jack, I watched the tape, and you were right.
I was kind of repulsive.
Oh, sweetie "Kind of" ?
Do you really think that you could help me ?
'Cause I'll do anything, except whatever he did.
Sure, come on up here.
Come on up here.
Come on.
Now, we're gonna try something new today, class.
It is called "Improv", which is short for improving, okay ?
Okay, Grace, are you ready ?
Wow, I didn't realize I was gonna have to do this in front of so many people.
I mean, there's almost five of you here.
Now, whatever I throw at you, you just do it.
Are you ready ?
And you're a cat.
But sexy.
You're walking in mud.
Not the cat, you !
All right, forget it.
All right, let's This isn't working.
Let's try something a little more relatable.
Okay ?
Um You're a mailbox.
But you're the sexiest mailbox ever.
Who likes to dance An Irish jig With one leg, on fire, underwater, who's sexy - Where'd the cat go ?
- Stop it !
I can't do this !
God, I'm so confused.
I'm a cat.
I'm a mailbox.
I'm a cat box.
Grace, you've gotta be more patient.
I know I can help you through this.
When Russell first came to me, he had no grasp of Pinter.
Now he grasps his Pinter every day.
Forget it.
I'll just get Leo tapes from that season on "Party of Five" when Jennifer Love Hewitt's boobs grew 15 inches over two episodes.
Okay.
Welcome to the second meeting of the loser's club.
Let me get you a drink, sir.
Maybe I'll get some snacks while I'm at it.
Maybe some mozzarella sticks and a big pile of peanuts.
What the hell, I'm alone, right ?
I might as well be fat and shiny.
They ain't love handles if nobody loves ya.
He's nice.
- I love our little club.
- Me too.
- You know what I'd love more ?
- Tell me.
You and me making dirty on a squeaky cot.
You read my mind.
I just had a great idea.
Let's go to the video store and take all the romantic comedies and put them in the science fiction section.
- To spite.
- To spite.
- My tongue is double-jointed.
- What ?
- To spite.
- To spite.
I love to love you, baby.
I Aaaahh !
- You sick, twisted freak !
- No, no, no, no.
- Let me explain !
- You videotaped me in the shower ?
- That is such a violation !
- But - I don't want to hear it !
- You were sexy !
I'm listening !
I figured if you didn't know I was there, you'd be yourself.
And you where.
Watch the tape if you don't believe me.
You were free and uninhibited.
Oh, my God, you were there for that part ?
Don't worry, I'm going to score that section with violins and maybe a slide whistle for comedy.
That's not what it looked like !
I'm a very thorough soaper.
- On the house.
- Thank you very much.
We just got engaged.
You sure you wanna do that ?
Yeah, I love him.
Sure, now.
Hell, I love him now.
But wait a minute and a half.
Love is like a horse-drawn carriage ride.
It seems romantic at first, but eventually you realize you're cold, and you're staring at an ass that craps right in front of you.
- Oh, my God, you're horrible !
- Honey Come on, you were thinkin' it too.
Where have you guys been ?
You missed it.
I think I just broke up an engagement.
And they're young too.
Sorry we're late, Will.
Something came up.
I don't get it.
What's funny ?
Well, things that come up are often funny, Will, especially if they haven't come up since 1997.
Oh, look, look.
The engaged guy's flirting with the cocktail waitress.
- Which one is he, hon ?
- He's right over there.
Oh, look, the fiancee's coming back.
I think she threw up.
Sweet !
Watch them and tell us what happens.
Ooh, they're fighting.
Oh, my God, I hope she slaps him.
Hey, I'm dry.
Where's the barkeep ?
Sweetie, he's right behind you.
Oops !
Sorry.
I thought it was her.
Although it was nice.
Wait a minute.
Are you two Honey, that's what happens when an irresistible force meets an insane object.
But we we hate love.
That's our club slogan.
And it's the theme of our upcoming Annual Barn Dance.
Well, we were wrong, honey.
Love's good, especially the third time, when you cut the oxygen off a little.
That was fantastic.
I thought you were trying to kill me.
Stop this !
This flies in the face of everything we stand for !
- You have to break up !
- Oh, come on, Gay Will.
- Aren't we allowed to be happy ?
- No !
No, we're not.
Love is a crapping horse !
All right, Joanne, let's try it again.
And remember, you've been unjustly accused of adultery, they've taken away your children, and you've just now realized - you're blind.
- Blind, got it And action.
Today's winning Powerball numbers are 16, 53, 31, and 7.
Okay.
All right.
I want you to bring it back to me again tomorrow.
But this time do it as if you're really, really good.
Ahh !
Don't kill me.
Jack, I'm not gonna kill you, but I do need to talk to you.
Okay.
Class, take five.
That's showbiz lingo for I'll be back whenever I feel like it.
Let me just say this.
One what you did to me is completely unforgivable.
And two that tape was hot.
So we need to make another one for Leo, 'cause I'm keeping this one.
- So I helped you ?
- I guess you did.
Here's the key to my apartment.
I am usually in the tub around 8:00.
So don't come then.
And next time, I'm not going to shave my legs.
That part dragged a little.
That's the same feedback I've been getting too I mean, you think ?
I love to love you, baby You will never believe who hooked up.
Alec Baldwin and Dennis Quaid ?
I was just thinking about it in the shower.
Karen and Mr. Stein.
Can you believe that ?
It's like when Drunky met Crazy.
I don't know It's kind of nice.
Where are they registered, the Jack Daniels distillery ?
It's unnatural.
Pairing up never works.
When I build my ark, everyone's gonna get on one by one.
Single file, no talking !
- Why do you care ?
- I don't !
It's just that if you're gonna join a lonely and bitter club, you gotta at least stay bitter.
Oh.
I was wondering what these buttons were about.
- Why are you in this club ?
- Because I do care about Barry.
And I did plan a trip for the two of us.
I even baked him a world's best boyfriend cake.
Is it in the fridge ?
- Oh, Will.
Why didn't you tell me ?
- I can't tell you stuff like that.
- Why not ?
- Because you've got a guy now.
You know, before, we were both losers.
We'd come home from our dates, and we'd swap our loser stories.
Your date would turn out to be gay.
Mine would turn out to be straight.
We'd laugh about it and eat some cake.
- Really, is it here ?
- Focus.
But now you got someone.
You're a winner.
A loser can't tell a winner a story.
Oh, sweetie, please.
I can be married 100 years, and I will still be a loser.
I videotaped myself in the shower, for God's sake.
Wow.
Is that what it takes to get you into a shower ?
Really - you gonna be okay ?
- Yeah, I think so.
You need me to stay over for a couple of days ?
'Cause I can do it.
It'd be no problem at all.
- Your apartment's a mess, isn't it ?
- A total pigsty.
At this point, it'd just be easier to move.
Will We have something to tell you.
My boyfriend, Mr. Stein, and I have decided to break up.
That's right, Will.
Romance comes every day, but a little club like ours, that's once in a lifetime.
So come on, let's go get a drink and just spit in love's eye.
You just spit in my eye, sir.
Well, as long as it makes you happy.
You know what, guys, it's fine.
Please, go back to doing whatever it was your meds led you to believe you were actually doing.
I think they're cute.
Who are you ?
Am I the only one who sees her ?
Well, Mr Stein Now that we have Will's blessing, how would you like to go back to my plush suite at the Palace Hotel ?
I don't know.
Now that it's not forbidden, it doesn't seem as exciting anymore.
You're right.
Hey, let's go pick up another couple.
Awesome.
Team W&G ~seriessub.com~
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Oh, does Jacques' have a new chef ?
What is this ?
It is an Eggo.
Fancy.
Would you mind if I put a little syrup on it ?
I would not, we are not that kind of establishment.
It's nice to not have anything in your head, isn't it ?
Join us.
We're livin' out loud.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
You know, if you want some breakfast, I'd order now, 'cause in about a half an hour, the lunch menu kicks in.
It is Hot Pockets.
I'm gonna wait for the Pocket.
Just a reminder, tomorrow's my birthday.
Just another reminder, my husband abandoned me to help the needy, so the presents need to be bigger and better.
I got you something great.
You want a hint ?
No !
You know I have to be surprised.
Remember two years ago how upset I got when you left your present out for me to find ?
"Left it out" ?
It was hidden in a storage locker in Queens.
That I rented under an assumed name.
You bit through a combination lock.
Just make sure it doesn't happen again.
Oh, poor Grace.
Alone on her birthday.
Yeah, poor Grace.
Know why I'm laughing ?
'Cause you're single ?
No.
I've arranged to have Leo come back early to surprise her for her birthday.
- Peas and carrots, peas and carrots ?
- What ?
Well, how'd you do that, Willona ?
It was actually easy.
I chartered a camel from Mombasa to take Leo to a landing strip in Malindi where a gypsy helicopter will fly him to Nairobi.
And from there, it's just a short I could have flown him direct, but it's like a hundred dollars more.
I know.
Good, right ?
No I was laughing 'cause you know, you're single.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 20 Leo Unwrapped sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Surprise !
I just broke my favorite bookmark.
Wh where is everybody ?
And why are you nude ?
What are you doing here ?
You're not supposed to be back till Sunday.
- It is Sunday.
- It's Saturday.
It can't be.
I left on Saturday and I've been on ten planes, and a bus, and what I'm still convinced was an anti-semitic camel.
Guess that's why they wouldn't give you the kosher meal.
You know, the flights were no picnic either.
I had to sit through Lilo and Stitch 17 times.
Not that I don't appreciate everything you did to get me here, but did you know that for only about $100 more, I could have flown direct ?
Oh, you're kidding !
Wow.
That, uh Will, that robe needs pants.
Hey.
Lotta men wear shorty robes.
James Caan wears a shorty robe.
Look, if there's no party tonight, I'm just gonna head home.
You know, I'm exhausted, they lost my luggage, and five minutes into the flight, the stewardess spills a tray of orange juice all over me.
By the time we flew over London, bees had built a hive on my lap.
No, no, no.
No, you can't go home.
You'll ruin the surprise.
You gotta stay here tonight.
Look, you can crash in my bedroom, and tomorrow you can help me with the party.
How are you with a pastry bag and rosette tips ?
I never tried 'em, but why don't we hold each other for awhile, and we'll see how we feel after that ?
What are you doing here ?
It's my birthday eve.
I'm alone.
I'm staying over.
No, you can't !
You you gotta get out of here !
Why do I have to Wait a minute You want me out ?
Oh you're in a robe.
Oh I smell orange juice.
Oh I have no idea what's going on.
All right, look, the gig is up.
You want your birthday present ?
'Cause I might as well just give it to you now.
No, tomorrow.
It has to be on my real birthday.
Well, then, you better get outta here, because it's on its way up here.
No, no, wait.
I don't wanna see it.
Well, then, you better get out !
Not the elevator !
It might be in the elevator.
Use the stairs.
Okay, but first thing tomorrow morning, I'm coming over.
Good, fine, go.
Leave it, leave it, leave it !
Hellooo ?
I need you and Karen to keep Grace busy all day tomorrow.
I can't, I have plans.
I just hooked up with the cute ugly guy from the Kiehl's counter at Barney's.
Does he have any of that pineapple papaya facial scrub ?
Because everybody's out of it.
Thank you.
Leo got back a day early, and I don' want them running into each other 'cause it'll ruin the surprise.
No problem.
I'd be happy to help.
Hey, why the long robe ?
Come on, get up, it's my birthday !
- Happy birthday, honey !
- Thank you.
Okay.
Here we are, honey.
Surprise !
An arcade ?
All this just to bring me to an arcade a block from my apartment ?
Why did you have to cover my head ?
'Cause your hair's a disaster.
Ugh I fell asleep in my clothes.
You'd think after two days, this orange juice would have dried.
Oh, you got a message from Air-Picture-of-a-Gazelle.
- They still haven't found your luggage.
- Yeah, I knew I was in trouble when my boarding pass was a coconut.
I gotta get some stuff for the party.
I still can't find a decent vegetable glycerin soap for the guest bathroom.
It makes me insane.
Anyway, help yourself to whatever's in the fridge.
Unless it's marked "party".
Or "Will's".
Oh, and when you wipe down the counter top, use water only.
You know what polished concrete's like.
I can't believe you haven't found a man.
I know.
Oh And if you want a little entertainment, while I'm gone, I just got Xanadu on DVD.
That finally came out on DVD ?
I guess all my letter writing paid off.
Yeah.
You know, there's an extra ten minutes of roller ballet ?
That's great, you know, 'cause the first time I saw it, the roller ballet felt short.
I know.
Okay, don't answer the phone, and stay put.
Don't answer the phone and stay put.
Okay, I got it.
Have fun.
Psst Like Xanadu ?
Who doesn't ?
Here you go.
Ten extra minutes of roller ballet.
Excellent.
What's better than a Vanilla Coke and a jalapeño chili dog on your birthday ?
A breath mint ?
Hey, guys.
Look what I got from my skee ball tickets.
It's a monkey on a trapeze.
I'm tired of it.
Okay.
Come on.
I wanna go on the Dance Dance Revolution machine.
You can't, Grace.
Somebody's on it.
Oh, let me take care of this.
I'm good with kids.
Hey.
Puberty.
Step off !
No way.
Okay.
Well, wouldn't it be more fun to play with my "make your own fake I. D." kit ?
Cool !
Come on, Grace.
You're up.
Remember, just follow the arrows and try to keep up with the beat.
Okay, honey, shake your booty.
Shake your groove thang.
Shake your Do those move ?
Not only do they move, they They don't move.
Okay, hit it.
Oh, please.
This is easy.
Ooh, okay.
Here we go.
Crap !
Crap !
Crap !
Son of a bitch !
Now I have to pee !
Come on, Jackie.
Why don't you give it a try ?
I don't know, Karen.
I'm not much of a dancer.
Scary bathroom, scary bathroom.
Gotta find a clean one.
Gotta pee !
Gotta pee !
Gotta pee !
Who left the seat up ?
- Sorry.
That was me.
- That's all right.
I forgot how good that was.
If it weren't for my three wives in Africa, I would have forgotten, too.
Don't give me that face.
You're still my favorite.
You're an ass.
I missed you.
Me, too.
You got anything to eat ?
I'm starving.
All Will had in his fridge was a soothing eye mask.
I only got half of it down.
When were you at Will's ?
I wasn't.
- But you just said that you were - No, I didn't.
Crap.
Will flew me in to surprise you for your birthday.
But I got here early, so he's been hiding me in his apartment so I wouldn't ruin the surprise.
Oh, my God, that's unbelievable.
Wait, does that mean there's not gonna be a real gift ?
I feel bad I wrecked it, you know ?
The poor guy went to so much trouble.
I'm not gonna go into the details, but it involved a VW bus, a leaky canoe, and a very awkward breakfast with Desmond Tutu.
- Poor thing.
- I know.
He didn't win the Nobel Prize for chewing with his mouth closed.
No.
I mean, poor Will.
He did all of that just to surprise me 'cause he knows just how much I love surprises.
- We can't ruin this for him.
- Well, surprise !
It's ruined !
Not necessarily.
I mean, I know.
But he doesn't know that I know.
So if you go back to Will's and pretend that you never saw me, then he'll never have to know that I knew.
- No.
- No, "knew".
No !
I'm not going back there.
There's shorty robes and Xanadu, and coffee mugs that have to go in the exact same place every time !
Come on.
He did this for me.
Do this for him.
Now, is there anything different about you from when you left Will's apartment ?
I got the orange juice out of my clothes.
Hey !
I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your shorty robe.
Or, as the guy in the laundry room called it, my penis ruffle.
You went to the laundry room ?
I told you to stay in the apartment !
What if Grace had seen you ?
What if Grace had been in the laundry room ?
She wouldn't be doing laundry, but there is a candy machine down there.
Get out here.
I wanna go over the plan with you.
Ah, yes.
The plan.
You had it laminated You say that like it's a weird thing.
Okay, 6:00, you go over to Jack's and wait there.
fun, fun, chit-chat, presents.
Then, 7:30, you wait in the hallway, I'll open the door, you jump in and yell "surprise "!
.
Damn it, the coffee cups go up here !
Do I have to draw you a diagram again ?
- If you are gonna be a guest in this apar - I saw her, okay ?
There's no surprise.
What ?
I I After you left, I went to our apartment and Grace saw me.
You wh ?
Why ?
- I needed something to wear.
- I gave you my clothes.
Please.
Your clothes are too tight on you.
Great.
This is the worst thing that's ever happened !
Hey, I just came from Africa.
Do you have any idea how many people there are suffering from ruined surprise parties ?
Wait a minute.
If Grace knows, why did she send you back here ?
Because she was so touched by what you did, she asked me to play along so I wouldn't spoil the surprise.
This is supposed to be her surprise, but she's more concerned about my joy at seeing her surprised than her own joy at being surprised ?
Dude, I don't know.
I'm just happy to have a dry crotch.
Wait, wait we gotta proceed with this plan.
You can't tell her I know.
It's over, Will.
She knows.
Yeah, she knows, and I know, but she doesn't know that I know she knows.
It can still work.
All must be as it was.
Oh, my God This game is amazing !
Honey, look, I'm winning, I'm winning !
Karen, that's a change machine.
I don't care what you call it.
Where do we cash in these buttons ?
Where have you been ?
You were gone so long we had to eat your funnel cake.
Wait a minute.
We're not the only ones eating your funnel cake.
You had sex.
Come on, give it up.
Who was it ?
I ran into Leo.
But you can't tell Will I found out.
I mean, I know.
But he doesn't know I know.
And now that you know I know, you can't let Will know that you know I know, you know ?
No Do you know ?
I think I know.
But I'm sure I don't care.
Okay, you fill him in.
I need to go pee again.
Oddly, the bathroom here is cleaner than the one at home.
Poor Grace.
Her surprise is ruined.
Right ?
We should help her, Jackie.
It's her birthday.
She deserves a real surprise.
Now put your thinking cap on.
What would be a bigger surprise than Leo showing up ?
Blanket Michael Jackson, I've got it !
Leo not showing up.
Karen, it's beautiful.
Thank you.
You're welcome, honey.
Happy birthday.
Oh, and See this one right here ?
It's pure cyanide.
So if you're ever in a jam, just bite down hard.
Wear it in good health.
- Now, now me, me, open mine.
- Thanks, Jack.
I wouldn't get too excited.
It's probably just another one of his headshots.
It's not a headshot.
Okay, it's a headshot.
Oh, and look.
An updated résumé on the back.
Ooh, 7:30.
Time for my present.
And it's a big one.
Now, let me see That's funny.
Could have sworn I brought it in here.
Maybe it's in the hallway.
What kind of present would be in the hallway, I wonder ?
What do you think it is ?
I hope it's another party, 'cause this one's a snooze.
- Happy - Oh, my - Where is he ?
- Wait a minute, what do you mean, "he" ?
- Leo.
- You knew he was coming ?
Of course I knew.
Didn't you know I knew ?
Yeah, I knew you knew, but I didn't want you to know I knew you knew.
That I did not know.
I just kept up this whole charade 'cause I wanted you to have a good surprise on your birthday.
I only did it so that you would have the fun of surprising me.
Happy birthday.
Thank you, sweetie.
So where's my husband ?
Surprise !
He's not coming !
Man, we got you !
Okay, come on.
Come on, seriously, where is he ?
We're not sure.
No.
Once we drove him out of town and dumped him in a ditch, it's anybody's guess.
- What were you thinking ?
- You threw him out of a car ?
Hey, calm down.
We just thought that it was so sweet that you wanted to surprise Grace and that she wanted to let you surprise her and, well, we just wanted you both to get what you wanted.
Wait Does any of this look familiar ?
Yes, I remember passing this orchard.
Oh, there he is !
Holding up all those apples.
That's an apple tree, brainiac.
Wait.
I smell orange juice.
Pull over.
Pull over !
Why, look, it's Leo.
But I thought he was in Africa.
Surprise !
Oh, my god, I had no idea !
This is the best birthday ever !
- Who wants cake ?
- No, no cake, please.
I've been stuck out in the cold for two hours.
I'm freezing, I'm covered in mud, a weirdly-aggressive deer just tried to mate with me.
Oh, now I know where we are.
There is no surprise, okay ?
We all know it.
He knows, she knows, and they know, we know, and you know he knows she knows, and she knows they know and now everybody knows.
I know, so just stop pretending !
Ah, screw it.
Surprise !

This blows.
If I wanted to spend a Saturday handling heavy sacks I would've stayed married to Stanley !
You tricked us, Grace.
You said, they were casting for a sitcom called "A Gay Guy Two Hags and a Laundromat".
Look, look, the washer in my apartment has been broken for two months.
I'm desperate.
You have enough underwear to last you two months ?
What is this place ?
It's pretty.
Where are the fish ?
No, Karen.
It is a "laundry-mat".
People come here to clean their clothes Then, they reuse them.
Why, poor people are just plain clever.
I wonder why they can't figure out a way to make more money.
You've never been to a laundromat before ?
Whatwhy am I surprised ?
Last week at the post office, you kept tapping on the window and feeding peanuts to the clerk.
Why, there's so much real-life I've never experienced.
Sectional sofas for sale missing cats battered women shelters Fun !
Honey, look at me I'm finally using the Internet !
Yeah !
Ooh, and here's someone looking for a roommate.
Hey, should I get a roommate ?
Yes.
But don't have sex with him.
And when you do have sex with him have sex with him a lot.
Wow, I've really been missing out.
I'm gonna call this Liz non-smoker.
She sounds nice.
"Must have own sheets".
She's got a good sense of humor.
Hey, brought you some more change.
I tell you, you walk down Columbus Avenue with two rolls of quarters in your pocket you get a lot of attention.
Thanks.
Now, what's happening on your feet ?
I think she's talking about your shoes, Heidi.
What ?
They're clogs They're good for your back.
They're good for the back of your closet.
You know what, the hell with both of you.
I like 'em.
I'm gonna wear 'em.
Damn it !
I fell off my clog !
Not funny, I think I did something bad to my foot.
Well, you did that when you put the clogs on this morning !
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 21 Dolls And Dolls sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Will called from the doctor I guess he actually sprained something.
So I guess it's just going to be you and me for the good old-fashioned foldin' party.
Grace, just because you say the words "good old-fashioned," doesn't make it a party.
Even though I made a good old-fashioned foldin' party mix tape ?
Okay, now it's a party.
Do you see ?
Do you see why it's a party ?
- Hey, what's the big idea ?
- It is such a great song I think we should save it for sock bundling.
You know, we would never have this much fun if Will were here.
You know, he practically ruined my good old-fashioned find-the-bad-smell party.
Why does he always have to be in such a bad mood ?
With those With those angry arms.
Stop taking my money !
Stop leaving crumbs on the carpet !
Stop making fun of my angry arms !
Yup, sometimes he could be a little mean and intense.
Wow.
Do you think he'd ever kill us ?
No, come on It's Will.
Maybe you should move your glass off the coffee table.
Pick up the glass !
Wipe down the ring !
You're right, first he sees The Ring, and then we die !
Hey, what're you guys doing ?
I- I-it's a good old-fashioned folding party.
It was Grace's idea !
Take her, she has funny genitals !
A good old-fashioned folding party ?
Why is it all you have to do is add "good old-fashioned" to something and you got yourself a good time.
I hope you saved the fitted sheet for me.
It's fun to pretend it's a giant shower cap.
Areare you okay ?
Yeah.
Oh, I mean I was I was in a lotta pain.
But then, the doctor gave me these painkillers, and I feel a lot better.
About everything, actually.
Oh !
No good.
Wow.
Cheery Will I like it.
Unless he's cheery because he's back there loading his gun !
So I had this apartment to myself for 10 years because I was having an affair with my boss.
And he paid half the rent so we'd have some place nice to "do it".
But then he got murdered.
And I-I couldn't really afford it on my own.
So what's your story ?
Well, since my marriage ended I've been living at The Palace.
And even though I've made a lot of swell friends, it's lonely.
I wanna a real home with, um, with real people.
I mean, you're real, right ?
Super real.
Okay, true or false ?
I'm easy to live with.
- True.
- False.
I'm a nitpicker supreme.
I think it comes from all my years as a professional in the music biz.
You're in music ?
Yeah, I-I didn't want to put it on the ad because then, you know you just get a bunch of wannabes knocking on the door I'm an office manager for the company that does those collections you see on T.V. You know, Hits of the '80s, Ladies of the '80s Rock Ballads of the '80s.
The '90s.
Well, I can see why you'd wanna keep that a secret, Liz.
I mean, you must never know if people are really liking you just for you or the '80s hits.
So, um, you should know that you know I- I like things done a certain way.
Just ask Melissa and Keith.
They work under me.
Like, if they're five minutes late for work, I look at my watch I look at them and they just get it.
Oh !
Oh, my God.
I totally just bragged.
Please tell me to shut up.
Cut to me still talking about myself.
Um, Liz I know we haven't known each other very long but I think that you might be just about the most interesting person I've ever met.
- I could learn tons from you.
- Okay, okay, true or false ?
- I think you're great - Um False.
- True !
- Oh, this game is so hard !
Oh, Jack.
Look, have you seen Will ?
I've been tryin' him for a couple of days and he hasn't returned my calls.
Yeah, I think he's home.
He didn't go to work ?
Is he all right ?
Is his ankle worse ?
Grace, I'm trying to run a business.
Hey, sweetie.
Look !
TiVo saved all the "American Idols" for me.
I love Paula Abdul.
And I love that we live in a world that would give a Paula Abdul a second chance.
- Uh, why aren't you at work ?
- Oh, I'm sick.
My ankle still hurts.
Oh, have you ever seen "King of Queens" ?
It's funny sometimes !
But I don't really believe that she'd stay with him Or do I ?
No, I don't think I do.
Well, I don't have to settle this right now.
Oh, hey !
I made cookies.
Oh, thanks, sweetie.
Oh, boy.
There's chocolate on the carpet.
I'm sorry.
What a mess.
- Eh, leave it.
- Okay, now you're freakin' me out !
There are crumbs on the carpet your robe doesn't match your socks and, oh, my God there's no product in your hair !
I'm calling 9-1-1 !
I'm fine.
You know I- I got those nice little pills.
- Ooh, better call in a refill.
- Already ?
Little secret: if you cheat and take 'em a little closer together you can avoid the pain completely.
It's even pretty effective in squashing the lingering ache from having to work so hard for my mother's affection making it nearly impossible for any man to love me enough to make up for the hole she left in my heart.
That may have been the greatest day of my life.
I love errands.
They're like mini adventures for undesirables.
Okay, so your half of the bill is $30.45 and don't try rounding it down like my last roommate 'cause that is just "F'd up".
Well, you don't have to worry about me, Liz.
I intend to pull my own weight around here.
Now, did you take a look at the chore wheel ?
Because you're in charge of emptying the ant traps and organizing the CD tower.
How did I go my whole life without ever learning any of those words ?
Karen !
You shouldn't have bought this cheesecake.
I'm, like, totally eating healthy this week.
Cut to me eating this whole cheesecake.
Oh, Liz.
I love when you do "cut to me".
Everybody does.
Oh, Lizzie.
I rented us a video.
You are going to get me into so much trouble.
If you're lucky.
- You're crazy.
- Like a fox.
- I doubt it.
- You wish.
- Don't I ever.
- You and what army ?
I'm so glad we're roomies.
You know, I've lived with men practically my whole life.
I didn't know what I was missing.
I mean, the bond that can grow when two single gals share a tacky apartment with too many clocks and vanilla candles.
You know what, Karen ?
Guys just mess everything up Or get murdered.
We are strong independent career women.
- We don't need men to make us happy.
- You said it, sister So you wanna go see if we can get laid ?
Totally.
- That's weird.
- Looking for these, Miss Taylor ?
What're you doing here ?
Give me those.
No.
We're not going to let you do this to yourself.
We think you have a problem And we ate all your Mueslix.
- Who's "we" ?
- We wanna help you, Will.
- Get out of my apartment !
- No.
You have a problem.
You have got to get off gotta get off this merry-go-round.
- I want those pills !
I have pain !
- Effie, we all got pain !
Look, we understand.
You're an elderly gay man with a poochie tummy and an unappealing personality.
Why wouldn't you be in pain ?
I Wait a minute, those aren't even my pills.
Those are just old antibiotics.
They are ?
Crack whores are sneaky !
Oh, wait, look !
These pills have become a crutch.
And these crutches have become a coat rack.
Damn, you're right.
Okay, we'll do it your way.
I'll just, uh bring in the paper and we'll make a pot of coffee Start a whole new day.
- We're good friends.
- Smart of us to catch on.
- He's not coming back, right ?
- No, no, I don't think so.
Thanks, Tony.
That's Tony.
When I first start coming here I thought he was gross.
Cut to me flat on my back on his futon.
God, this is great.
Casual sex, mookie bartenders, dirty futons This is the stuff of life I'm gonna get an S.T.D. tonight !
- Man, I am so buzzed.
- You wanna French ?
Not right now.
I got my eye on this guy.
I think he's really into me or at least he's gonna be.
I got my eye on some one too.
Let me look for him.
There he is !
Kurt !
- Wait, you can't like him.
I like him.
- But I like him too.
Well you have to back off.
Because it's the first rule of being a good roommate.
- You can't go after the same guy.
- Then why don't you back off ?
- Because I saw him first.
- How do you know ?
- How do you know I didn't ?
- Damn, your street smarts.
- I'm going for him.
- I'm going for him too !
- Hey, Kurt, mind if I join you ?
- Well, I'm kinda dancing with her.
Or would you rather be dancing with an office manager ?
- You know, I was here.
- And now you're gone.
Hey, Kurt, check this out.
Hey, Kurt, look at me !
- Here I am.
I'm your lady, Kurt.
- Take it, take it.
Kurt, have you been working out ?
- Wait, you're not Kurt !
- You're not Kurt either !
Now look what you've done.
Me ?
You scared him off with your big boobies and your weird bisexual vibe.
He was into me !
No one's into you.
You're an oddly confident I'm a professional in the music business with two people working under me.
Melissa and Keith hate you !
- Take it back !
- No !
Yes !
Oh !
You ripped it This is everybody's favorite top on me !
Who's "everybody" ?
Melissa and Keith ?
They hate you !
Come on, feel good buddy.
I know there's one in here.
Damn tic-tacs !
- Will, stop.
- Get outta here.
We are not leaving !
The pain is in your head, Will !
And now you're hooked on the junk !
I fell off my clog !
At some point, every one falls off their clogs but you gotta get back on your clogs and work through the pain.
And even though you may wanna take off your clogs again you gotta keep 'em on.
Will.
Let me show you something It's not going to be pretty.
Come on.
Come on, man !
Look at yourself.
Now, look at me.
I am adorable.
Now back to you.
You look awful !
I look the same.
Outta my way, you're blocking my view.
Will, you have to face it.
You're not yourself.
You haven't been to work in three days.
You threw your dry cleaning on a chair.
You told your mother that you'd call her back.
And then you did.
My God, what's happened to me ?
You know, of all my bad roommate experiences this has been the third worst.
That born-again Asian queen with a guinea pig was a better roommate than you !
Yeah ?
Well, of all the bars I've ever been kicked out of that one had the best onion blossom.
News flash: I want you out.
You're a sucky roommate !
What ?
You mean you're gonna end our friendship over some man in Dockers with Red Bull breath ?
I could've loved him.
I want you to write me a check for the rest of the month's rent and get out.
You know, I just wanted to try a new experience.
Make it out to the landlord "Walker Property Management".
Oh, and add on $1.09 You ate one of my yogurts.
Let's see, how do I break this to you ?
True or false ?
I own this building.
True.
Yeah, I am Walker Property Management and I think I want you out.
Wait a minute !
We're roommates.
We're friends, we could be lovers I'll take that French now.
Sorry Lizzy Boredom you've left me no choice.
That's right, cut to you living in a dumpster.
Feeling any better ?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened to me.
I was really out of control.
But I guess I had to hit rock bottom before I could admit I had a problem.
Will.
It was three days.
Really ?
God I was so whacked out it seemed like a long weekend.

{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Everybody had enough ?
Jack, Karen, seconds ?
Grace, fourths ?
I couldn't.
But you know what.
I wouldn't mind taking the rest of that for later.
You know you how you always get hungry an hour after veal parmigan ?
So, K, how's it going with the divorce ?
Do we know what we're getting yet ?
Well, we'll find out next week after the hearing but I'm not worried.
All we have to do is show that Stan cheated on me which the filthy pig did, no hard feelings.
May he rot in hell, I love him to pieces, the fat turd.
- And I get half of everything.
- Can I have half of that ?
- I may even get more than half.
- Me too.
Because I've got the best lawyer in town in my corner one Miss Wilma Truman.
Drop trou' and take a bow, honey.
Uh, Karen, I can't represent you.
Stan is my firm's biggest client.
I just assumed you knew I'd be representing him.
Well, I didn't know.
I just assumed that you and I were friends.
Well, I'll show you, missy.
I'll get another lawyer.
A better lawyer.
A gayer lawyer !
Yeah, well, good luck finding that.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 22 May Divorce Be With You sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ Well my lawyer should be here any minute.
Are you nervous, nelly ?
Look, Karen, I know it's awkward being on opposite sides but there's no reason this case should get in the way of our lukewarm friendship.
Wait till you meet this guy.
He's a killer.
He'll make a monkey of you.
But, of course, with your hairy back that shouldn't be much of a leap.
Hey, Mrs. Walker, sorry I'm late.
I figured, since I'm a lawyer now I should probably have a suit.
I stopped off at The Men's Wearhouse but my credit card got declined.
So I had to call my mom but not to worry.
I got the suit, and I'm ready to get medieval on law's ass.
- Will Truman.
- Oh, hi.
I've heard of you.
I'm Jason Towne but all the kids at law school call me "JT".
Well, uh not all of them.
Some of them call me Soupy 'cause, you know, I like soup.
What, uh, do I have a boog ?
No, no, no.
No boog.
Uh, I just You just seem very young.
That could just be me.
The other day I realized that the guy at Starbucks that I've been calling "Sport" is actually 32.
Wow, 32 scary.
- So, uh, you guys ready to party ?
- Fire it up, Soupy.
I'm buggin' out.
I can never get this thing open.
Yeah, they're kinda complicated.
Wait till you get car keys.
Can I see you outside for a second, please.
Sure, hon.
Oh, sweet !
My mom put in a Kudos.
He's a cutie, isn't he ?
Pretty lips.
He's an infant.
Where'd you find him the Montessori School of Law ?
Hey, for your information, he just won Deborah Harry a huge settlement from the tabloids for saying that she showed up at the market with undies on her head.
Which she did.
I'd show you pictures but I sold them to the tabloids.
Karen Your case is complicated.
It involves math and reading.
I'm afraid this kid is too green.
You're the one who's green green with envy.
Jealous much ?
Nervous much ?
Green much ?
Hey, guys, can we motor ?
I don't want to leave my roommates with my iguana for too long.
They'll get him high and make him eat ramen.
Worried much ?
Jack, thanks for filling in for Karen.
You know, it's kinda slow today.
So you could help me organize the back room.
Oh, today's not slow.
You have a client coming in any minute.
Client ?
What are you talking about ?
How do you even know that word ?
Well, I took a little "inish" and got you a meeting with an associate of mine.
And by "associate," I mean friend.
And by friend, I mean lover.
And by lover, I mean And by I mean wealthy.
- How wealthy ?
- He's got a TV in the bathroom.
Oh, what a great idea.
'Cause I miss so much TV when I'm in there.
Sorry, no public displays of affection.
They don't know I'm gay here.
I guess that means you haven't spoken or moved.
Come on.
All this, and I get to take a bath and watch Everwood.
And sometimes I turn on the TV, okay.
- Grace, Cam.
Cam, Grace.
- Hello, I'm Grace.
I just want to say I love everything you're wearing and I'm furious I didn't get those glasses first.
They're just for show.
I got them at an estate sale.
They're actually killing my eyes.
Pretty soon I'm gonna need glasses.
- What about her ?
- Did I tell you, did I tell you ?
All right, now I'll leave you two to talk.
I think you'll both find you have something fascinating in common me.
- Mr. Truman.
- Soupy, what are you doing here ?
I'm freaking out.
Mrs. Walker's case is like, mad complicated.
They keep on sending me all these papers and these folders.
I can't make any sense of any of it.
Can you help me ?
I'm the opposing counsel.
Yeah, but you're cool, right ?
No, I'm not cool.
I'm uptight and moody.
Which is not really the point.
I- It's unethical for me to help you.
But, but I'm gonna lose the case and Mrs. Walker's gonna lose like, thousands of dollars.
Millions.
Millions ?
Dang that's a lot of cheddar, yo.
That's craz-azy cheddar.
Look, all you have to do is is prove that Stan violated the prenup - and Karen gets half of everything.
- That would be awesome.
Like how ?
How ?
How did you get Debbie Harry the huge settlement ?
Dude, I didn't represent Deborah Harry I was, like, born during her comeback.
That was my dad's case.
I didn't realize there was a Soup Senior.
Look There's a fidelity clause in the agreement.
You prove that Stan violated that, and you're set.
Oh, boy.
Look, you didn't hear this from me but you might want to check out their surveillance tape from the prison.
They keep a record of all activity.
You might be able to figure out when Stan and his mistress hooked up.
Okay.
Then what ?
Well, then you can prove that Stan Violated The fidelity Fidelity cl Clams ?
Yes.
Stan violated the fidelity clams.
Clause !
He violated the fidelity clause !
Mr. Walker violated the fidelity clause ?
That's huge.
Can you prove that ?
Yes !
This is Grace Adler of Grace Adler Designs.
I was in there yesterday.
I told you I would be back today.
And now you're telling me you're all out ?
Do you know how much business I've given you over the years ?
How much money I've spent ?
You idiots never make enough chili !
Morning.
Oh, Jack, good morning.
Thank you so much for hooking me up with Cam.
I love him.
He has the most fabulous taste.
Meaning, I do, and he's got a platinum card.
Oh, and mister, don't think we've forgotten about you.
Guess who's getting a panic room with its very own stripper pole.
I don't know Maybe Cam's new boyfriend.
He dumped me in a restaurant.
It was harsh.
So was the lighting.
He gave me this watch to remember him by.
He doesn't know it yet.
Oh, Jack, I am so sorry.
Yeah, well, Grace I'm so sorry for you too.
I'll be okay.
Wait.
What ?
Well, I mean now you have to quit.
What kind of friend would you be if you kept working for the man who broke my heart ?
But, Jack, if everybody stopped working for men who broke your heart the city would shut down.
- Grace, hey.
- Uh, look, Cam, we need to talk.
What's the matter ?
I can't do this.
I can't be your designer.
Why ?
What happened ?
I thought it was going so well We clicked.
We were having fun.
I know.
It's just that that Jack's my friend and this really doesn't feel right anymore.
Oh, are you sure ?
'Cause this morning I decided to the hell with the budget I want the leather walls.
Oh, my God !
I love doing leather walls.
No, no, I can't.
It's it's not right.
Or is it so right ?
We can still work together.
Jack doesn't have to know.
Stop, you're confusing me.
- I'm sorry.
I have to go.
- I have a giant house.
It's in the country and it's enormous.
I want you to do it Will you do my giant house ?
Cam, I'd love to.
You know I'd love to, but I can't.
Okay, I understand.
But tell me, just for fun if you were to do my giant house what would you do to it ?
I don't know.
Sure, you do.
Describe it to me.
Well, I'd have to know how big it is.
I mean, you say it's giant.
But a lot of clients exaggerate.
Damn.
I don't care what anyone says.
Size does matter.
And I have a friend at Architectural Digest.
He wants to do an article on the renovation.
I see a picture of you in whatever we renovate doing this.
I love doing this.
Especially in pictures.
All right, I'll do it.
But only in the country house.
The city is too risky.
If Jack sees us together he'll never forgive me.
I'll get my checkbook.
I'll get my swatches.
They're in the bathroom.
I left them there yesterday when I was watching Oprah.
Hello, Cameron.
Sorry to bother you.
Especially since I'm a Oh, how did you put it Shrieking infant with the attention span of a fly.
But I left my Legos here.
What did you do with them ?
Here.
Now please you have to go.
Ok, but, they better all be here.
Why are you in such a hurry to get rid of me ?
Do you have another man here ?
Cam, I can't wait to get my hands on your Jack !
Grace !
You lied !
You do have another man here !
- And you, how could you do this to me ?
- Jack, let me explain No !
I don't wanna hear it !
I'll be leaving now.
It looks like I'm the only one around here with any integrity.
Is that my watch ?
I will not dignify that with a response.
Karen Will, what are you doing here ?
I'm having lunch with my attorney.
I guess this is where you go when you have a lawyer on retainer who wears a retainer.
Hey, those are invisi-braces.
Look, I'm gonna get right to the point.
Your lawyer's incompetent.
He's a nice kid.
Take him skateboarding.
Sneak him into an R-rated movie.
But for God's sake, do not let him represent you in a multi-million-dollar divorce case.
What do you know ?
He happened to have won a number of high-profile cases.
Like what ?
Bert v. Ernie ?
How dare you ?
That's mad insulting.
You think that I can't tell when someone's incompetent ?
Check out all these fries.
I only paid for a small, but score !
- What's up, bro ?
- Hey dog.
I'm leaving.
Think about what I said.
What was he doing here ?
Well, Will thinks, and I may be starting to agree, that you could be the wrong lawyer for me.
You have no experience, your suit doesn't fit and you giggle every time you say pro bono.
Bono.
Okay, that's funny.
But I don't know, JT I think maybe I better let you go.
This is too important to me.
and I can't afford to lose.
Oh, we're not gonna lose this case.
He is.
And you want to know why ?
'Cause I tricked him.
See, I walk into that room with my backpack and my big suit talking about my iguana.
I don't have an iguana.
I'm a lawyer.
I drive a Mercedes as big as a house.
And I totally got Deborah Harry that settlement.
And do you want to know how she thanked me ?
By rocking my world in the back of that Mercedes, that's how.
You feel me ?
How would you like to live under my skirt ?
Your dumb-ass friend spoon-fed me everything I need to win your case.
His client's gonna lose his shirt and Truman's gonna lose his job.
You chew on that.
I'll see you at the hearing tomorrow.
Oh, yeah, here.
Get yourself a bikini wax.
I like a clean work space.
Jack, come on.
Open up.
I know you're home.
I can hear your tap shoes.
What do you want ?
You're interrupting my tech rehearsal.
Boys and girlie boys, take five.
Look I feel terrible.
I went there to break it off.
And then we started talking and one thing led to another.
Before I knew what was happening he whipped out his checkbook and I was showing him my carpet samples.
Well, you hurt me, G. I know, which is why I ended it once and for all.
I am never seeing him again.
Yes, would have been the best job I ever landed But your friendship means too much to me.
Hm, Thanks for doing that, G. Jack, sweetie we need you back.
That dance captain thinks he's Fosse, but he's just bossy.
Hey, Grace.
Yeah, we're back together.
After you guilted me into quitting a job that would have landed me in Architectural Digest doing this ?
I can't believe you did this to me !
Oh, Grace.
Here's the advance on your design fee.
Thanks, I'll see you Friday.
- You're still working with him ?
- Well, you're still dating him.
- You're a terrible friend !
- You're a worse friend.
Eh.
What are you gonna do ?
What's up, Truman ?
Ready to throw down ?
Well, look at you.
I didn't think OshKosh B'Gosh made power suits.
You surprised to see me ?
Karen told me you tried to get me fired.
Did I get fired ?
No.
Look, JT, I just didn't think you were up to handling Karen's case.
Some of these hearings can run past 9:00.
You don't get it, old man.
I've been playing you like Pong.
That's a game from your era, isn't it ?
So what, this was all an act ?
How evil !
How sneaky !
How underhanded !
My God, you are a lawyer.
So, uh, thanks, bud.
This surveillance tape's gonna come in real handy when I hand you your balls in court.
Not so fast, Soupy.
The only one handling Will's balls will be Will.
- Yeah, but I can crush his balls.
- Excuse me.
They're in the room.
Will's my friend and I'm not gonna let you do anything to hurt his career.
So you're canned, Soup.
You don't want to make that mistake, baby.
JT, give us a minute, will you, please.
Holler if you hit puberty.
Look, if you're doing this to protect me, don't.
I can handle myself.
He may be young and pretty but I am old and irregular.
Which makes me mean.
Which makes me a good lawyer.
Are you sure, honey ?
'Cause I'd hate to see that kid nail you in there right before he nails me in here.
- Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
- You're sweet.
You really take good care of me, don't you ?
Despite my better judgment.
- I'm still gonna kill you, you know.
- Bring it on, Mary.
Hey, Little Man Tate you're back on.
For reals ?
Psych.
You're going down, pops.
P.S., today's soup is cream of I'll kick your ass.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Your childish tricks aren't gonna work in there.
You're playing with the grownups now, my friend.
Whatever.
After you.

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Gosh, Grace, it was so sweet of you to cook Will and Karen dinner.
Well, you know, I just figured after a long day at the divorce hearing it would be nice to come back to a home cooked meal.
You're so generous.
I swear, if you weren't Jewish you'd definitely go to heaven.
Thanks, Jack.
And if you weren't gay you'd go there too.
Who does that Stanley Walker think he is ?
Trying to cheat me outta half of his fortune ?
I gave that man the drunkest years of my life !
Oh, you've still got some good drunk years ahead of you, I bet.
Oh, and you two wouldn't believe the lawyer that Stan has.
Hmm, this Truman fella.
Tricky little queen.
Mincing around the conference room "I object, move to strike".
Yeah, he was a riot.
You know who else was something ?
The pill-popping shrew trying to get her hands on Stan's money.
Falling asleep on the conference table waking up with a shriek, throwing up a little in her purse.
Guys, guys, come on.
Let's relax.
Nobody got hurt, nobody got outed.
- Yay !
It's ready.
- Grace, I wanted to say that !
A "yay" is better from a gay.
Look, Will.
We've been cooking.
Oh, a cuisine of Chef Boy-are-you-lazy.
Hey, we were just trying to do something nice.
Sorry, if it wasn't as fancy as you would've done it.
With your squeezing pepper and your stirring things in bowls.
Sorry, it's just been a difficult day watching Joan Crawford address PepsiCo.
Oh, yeah, real rough day for you.
Meanwhile, my soon-to-be ex-husband is trying to screw me over.
I am never speaking to that man again.
I mean it, I'm done !
Miss Karen.
- I have awful news.
- What is it, Rosie ?
Because this day couldn't possibly get any worse.
It's Mr. Stan.
He's dead.
Hey, hey, I got off work early.
Picked up a couple of sixes, I found a 20 on the street.
Damn, it's good to be alive !
What ?
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 23 sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ I can't believe Stan is gone.
I feel so bad.
Maybe I could've saved him.
The man died schtupping his mistress.
I don't see how you could've saved him.
The point is the randomness of it all.
People die.
I might die.
Even worse, I might get old.
Really old.
- And we're back to Grace.
- I don't think we really ever left.
Hey, buddy.
That suit I couldn't find this morning looks good on you.
It's like a vacation for the seams.
- Hey, Karen.
- I'm so sorry, Karen.
- Could I get in on that ?
- Sure, you big softie, come on.
- Rosie - Yes, Miss Karen ?
- Could you do me a favor ?
- Anything, Miss Karen.
Could you go into the chapel and Lemon Pledge my pew ?
Like you had to ask.
I'm gonna go and make sure all the unattractive people are in the back.
You shouldn't have to bear anymore pain today.
Hey !
Lazy eye in the back !
- Will, Will.
- I'm right here, sweetie.
No, Will, when can I see the will.
You're very upset.
I don't think now is a good time to talk about that.
I know, honey, it's just that I'm feeling so many emotions Loss, anger, sadness.
Knowing how much money I'm getting would really snap all of that into focus.
Well, I'm not really sure I- I haven't seen the latest version.
Huh what huh latest huh ?
Yeah, Stan came in to see his estate attorney a couple of weeks ago.
I remember because it was the day that I tried the Rock deodorant and they asked me to leave at 3:00.
They changed his will Why would he do that ?
Looked what my husband's cash dragged in.
How could this happen, Letty ?
My Stanley, my little man.
I could still remember his last words.
"I'm I'm" and then he was gone.
- Lorraine.
- Karen.
- Back-up maid.
- Miss Karen.
Nice outfit for a funeral.
If that dress were any shorter I could see your English muffin.
I wouldn't talk.
If that dress were any lower I could see your yankee doodles.
You're a natty dresser.
Are you English ?
Oh, no, I'm gay.
Well, it's the same thing.
If that weren't true I'd find it offensive.
Come on, Karen.
Let's go inside.
Darling.
Darling.
I know this is a sad day for both of us.
But I just want you to know one little thing.
I'm getting it all.
Well, then, maybe you can treat yourself to some underpants.
Stanley Walker touched so many people's lives.
He was a wonderful husband a loving father a respected businessman His absence will leave a huge void in our lives that cannot possibly be filled.
All right, enough with the fat jokes.
And now a reading from Psalm 23.
"The Lord is my shepard" I don't know what I'd do if you died.
I hope I go first.
Then again, you love me so much that would be unbearable for you.
Yeah, you should die first.
Definitely you.
Can I go in my sleep or you looking for me to suffer ?
Hey, look at her.
I know.
We hate her.
We hate her even more than the know-it-all daughter on "The Gilmore Girls".
Is that tart flipping me off ?
Oh, I can't take it anymore.
Wilma !
Listen, I need to see that will and I need to see it right now.
Chop chop !
What're you suggesting ?
That I page a lawyer on the weekend and have him run the will over here ?
Drag some guy all the way to Westchester ?
Clear this place out in the middle of a funeral and start talking dollars and cents ?
Sounds good.
Oh, all right.
I wouldn't ordinarily do this but I'm dying to try my new Blackberry.
Why do you need to see the will ?
Stan changed it.
She might get everything.
Damn her !
I am never speaking to her again.
And now, a moment of silence as we reflect on the life of Stanley Walker.
Sorry.
- Turn it off, Leo.
- Good idea, Grace.
Hello ?
Oh, hey, how are you ?
I'd like you to have all your things out by tomorrow morning, all right ?
I'd like you to eat me.
An number of people have offered to share their memories of Stanley Walker.
And first up is his Well let's say, friend.
Lorraine Finster.
Thank you, Kevin.
Stanley Walker was a giant bear of a man.
And underneath that giant bear was a smaller bear.
And underneath that bear was me.
Gasping for air.
When I first met Stanley I was working in the cafeteria of a white collar prison.
At the time, I was deeply involved with the handsome embezzler who led a major telecom company into bankruptcy.
When I laid eyes on Stanley all thoughts of other criminals were forgotten.
- Stanley Walker was a great man.
- A big man.
A fat man.
- But he was also a kind man.
- A family man.
A surprisingly good dancer.
Whenever he stopped by my office he would always bring tulips.
I don't like tulips so I'd go down to the Korean market and exchange them for other flowers or a salad.
Or those little fig cookies that come three to a pack.
They're always up by the gum.
You know which ones I'm talking about ?
He was an accomplished Etch-a-Sketch artist.
I'd like to show you one he did for me.
I will always remember you Stanley Walker.
Always remember you, Stanley !
Hey, where did it go ?
I'll miss his humor He loved a good knock-knock joke.
Whenever I saw him he always had a new one for me.
Well, today, I have one for you, Stan.
Knock, knock.
- Knock.
Knock.
- Who's there ?
Will.
Will who ?
"Will" miss ya, Stan.
And now, to say a few words is Stan's loving second wife Karen Walker.
Two people are wearing your dress.
Most of you know about the recent trouble Stan and I have had.
Just in case you don't I'll get you up to speed.
The British whore killed him.
But the truth is we really did care about each other.
I guess what I'm trying to say is I want you all to leave so I can find out what's in his will.
I'm not kidding if you're not in the will, please exit.
The good people at Neutrogena have provided wonderful gift bags.
Please pick one up on your way out.
Leo, where were you ?
It was kind of an important phone call.
Doctors Without Borders.
They're opening a new clinic in Guatemala and they they want me to come help set it up.
Guatemala ?
You're going back to Africa ?
Yes, yes, and remind me to buy you an atlas.
I can't believe this.
You just got back - and now you're leaving again ?
- Can I just say something No, how could you be so insensitive ?
I mean, you have no sensitivity You're like the opposite of sensitive.
And while I'm at the bookstore I'll pick up a thesaurus for you too.
I'm glad that this is funny to you.
Ha, ha, big joke.
"My wife's dumb".
Ha, ha.
"I know more than one word that means insensitive".
Whoo-hoo !
Would you shut up.
You freak, I want you to come with me !
Oh.
Wait, are you really asking me or are you just asking - 'cause I kinda yelled at you ?
- I'm really asking you.
Baby, I want you to come.
This this is what I do And and you're you're who I do.
I- I just wanna be able to do who I do, while I do what I do.
- You do ?
- I do.
Guatemala !
I'm going to Spain !
Oh, Kare.
I'm sure you don't have anything to worry about.
Stan sure loved ya.
He'll make sure you're taken care of.
I don't know, honey.
That Cockney sucker had some kind of power over him.
For all I know, she could've talked him into signing everything over to her and leaving me nothing.
Huh.
'Scuse me for a second Hi, Lorraine.
How you hanging in there ?
Well, it's tough, Jackie.
I mean, I've been touched by death, haven't I ?
I was also touched by Stan's nephew.
Filthy little rascal tried to bugger me in the rectory.
Well, you do have a very pretty rectory.
If everyone could please take their seats.
We'll get started.
"I, Stanley Evelyn walker being of sound mind do hereby bequeath the following My cured meat room and all the contents therein shall be divided as follows.
All hanging salamis and domestic hams will go to my son Mason for reasons that will be clear to him.
My prosciuttos, mortadellas and the best of my wursts go to my beloved daughter, Olivia.
The entire contents of my jerky room" "shall be all chutneys Preserves and jams, including but not limited to, mustards shall go Rufus Huang of Empire Szechwan.
Thanks for the deliveries".
What ?
Ten trips a day and three back surgeries, all I get is mustard ?
Thanks for nothing, fatso !
- "Regarding my monetary assets" - I'm pulling for you, Kare.
Fingers crossed, Lorraine.
"First and foremost, for her years of undying love and loyalty I leave to my dear, dear maid, Rosario the sum of $10 million dollars".
I'm free !
I'm free from that evil witch.
I hope you rot and I hope it hurts.
"To be paid upon the completion of 20 more years of service to Karen Walker".
Can I get you a soda ?
Maybe later.
Like in 2016.
"To someone whom my second wife, Karen always held in such regard and spoke of with great affection" Oh, my God, that's me.
"Grape Antler".
"I leave you my life-sized oil painting of Karen so you never have to be far from her".
Oh, crap.
Maybe I can trade with that Chinese food guy.
"And to two of my favorite people whose commitment to each other has inspired me to look for love in my own life I leave the sum of $20,000.
Will Truman and Jack McFarland get married already".
Did you just propose to me ?
No !
I was reading the thing.
I guess Stan thought you and I were a couple.
Kiss him !
You gotta be kidding me.
This is ridiculous.
I know !
Who can get married for 20 thou' ?
My dress alone will cost 15 !
Continuing on.
"The remainder of my estate which includeses the entirety of my financial holdings all real estate and its contents will go to the true love of my life the woman I was meant to be with" "My wife, Karen".
Oh, my God !
Whoopee !
Kare, I was pulling for ya the whole time.
You, me "And finally, to Lorraine Finster " What the hell's left ?
His right teste on a biscuit ?
"Lorraine, you always said you wanted nothing from me but affection.
So I leave to you affection.
Ta".
I was trapped under that fatty for two days.
I've got the word "Posturepedic" permanently imprinted in my spine and all I get is "ta" ?
Well, I guess if you'd had ta-ta's you would've gotten everything.

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
I still can't believe Stan's gone.
And I must say, it was a beautiful funeral.
It was, and it really got me thinking.
We were the best looking ones there.
I know.
I mean, we were, like the reason it was beautiful.
So, how about Stan leaving us all that money ?
Twenty thousand dollars !
Yeah.
To plan our wedding.
I still have no idea why he thought we were a couple.
- Is that your third glass of wine ?
- Are you counting ?
Sweetie, I am so excited about going to Guatemala with you.
I'm a doctor without borders.
Technically, you're not a doctor.
Hey, I got a "B" in high school biology.
Down there, I'm a doctor.
Well, well, I've never seen trash take itself out.
Stuff it, you bitter witch.
Just getting the rest of my things before they start to reek of booze and anti-growth hormone.
Well, then, you won't mind if I take a look in that suitcase.
Up yours !
I may be a gold digger a stripper and a whore nine arrests no convictions.
But I am no thief.
I admire your principles.
Almost as much as I admire my diamond ring in your hand.
Give it up.
And ?
And ?
Wow, impressive.
Had we met years ago and under different circumstances this might have been hello instead of good-bye.
I'll be leaving now.
But I won't be leaving quickly.
And why ?
Because I have a diamond tiara up my bum.
Will & Grace Saison 5 - Episode 24 sous-titres par la Team W&G ~seriessub.com~ It was a lovely reception, Karen.
I was especially moved by the Taco Bell fly-over.
Well, thank you, Lars.
You know, you kids can go if you want to.
I've got a lot to do before the yacht leaves for St. Barts in the morning.
Why are you going to St. Barts ?
Oh, oh, visiting "friends" ?
No, Stan wanted his ashes scattered in the Caribbean off the back of his yacht.
It's going to feel very empty there without him.
Of course, any place would feel empty without Stan.
He took up a lot of room.
Karen.
We, uh, we could join you.
Oh, I'd love it if you girls would come with me.
Hey, did you know there's a jacuzzi onboard ?
A jacuzzi ?
I love bubbles !
Wow, fun !
There gonna be some spa-like things where we're going ?
Well, the whole country's pretty much like a steam room.
Oh, and Chef will be there with his famous morning crêpe station.
- Crêpes !
- I love folded foods !
We'll have nice meals, right ?
Depends if the food drop came that week.
And the shopping.
All of the stores on St. Barts are duty-free.
Duty free !
Lotta doody.
Gracie, honey why don't you come with ?
I can't.
I have to help people.
You go have fun in your jacuzzi and your crêpes, and your shopping.
I'll be fine sleeping in my own filth and waiting for food to drop down from the sky.
Hey, sweetie.
- Come on why don't you go ?
- What ?
Really ?
Yeah, I mean I love you but let's face it.
The thought of you doing something selfless is a joke.
I love that you get me.
Hey, guys we're going on a cruise !
Dr. Markus ?
Uh, there's a Dr. Morty here to see you.
Great.
Tell Dani to come in.
Oh, suddenly, I work for you too.
Karen, I'm really sorry to do this here but this trip came about so fast they had to get my paperwork started so Dani offered to come and bring it by for me.
Oh, good !
I finally get to meet the famous Dr. Morty.
- Leo's going to Guatemala with him.
- Her.
Hi, I'm so sorry to intrude.
Leo, your papers.
Thank you.
Dani, this is Will and Jack, Karen Rosario.
Nice to meet you.
This is my wife, Grace.
Oh, Leo never mentioned he was married.
Oh, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
He talks about you all the time !
All the women at the hospital they hate you.
And one of the male nurses.
Yeah, he mentioned you too.
Although when he said "Dr. Morty," I pictured an old blotchy Jew who kept saying, "You call this dinner "?
You've met my father.
I better get going.
It was great meeting you.
Hey, I'll walk you out.
- Bye.
- Bye, now.
She seems nice.
You must be dying !
Aren't you dying ?
Your husband is going to Guatemala with that !
I would die !
I know !
That bod !
She could be in a Whitesnake video !
Just !
die !
That is some lucky flesh-eating virus that gets her.
- Die !
Die !
Die !
- Okay !
I get it !
She's gorgeous and she saves lives.
Big whoop.
I look good sometimes.
And I let people cut in front of me in line at the supermarket.
Well, I haven't but I've thought of it.
Come on, Gracie.
You have nothing to worry about.
I know that !
I'm very secure in my relationship.
I love my husband and I know that he loves me.
I would die !
I'm glad you all could be here.
I spent a lot of time with Stanley on this boat.
Not with him, I'd be with the crew on the opposite side to keep us from tipping.
Here are the ashes.
Wow !
Is that all Stan ?
No, there's another can in the limo.
They put him in a popcorn can ?
Isn't that a little unseemly ?
No more so than the cremation.
It took four days and xused so much power that all of Bergen County lost their air conditioning.
Mrs. Walker ?
We're just about ready to shove off.
Thanks, Driver.
That's the captain ?
That's your limo driver !
Yeah, drive a boat, drive a car, drive a plane.
As long as I'm drunk what's the difference ?
Well, I should probably get going.
Our plane takes off in a couple of hours.
- "Our" plane ?
- Yeah, me and Dani.
You're flying together ?
Yeah, we're going to the same place.
Why ?
No, nothing.
It's just that you never mentioned it.
It's an interesting omission on your part.
The way you omitted that it's interesting to me.
- Are you okay ?
- I'm good.
I'm good.
It'll be fun flying together.
And lucky for you, if you have to make a water landing she has those huge flotation devices attached to her chest.
Tell me, do they light up ?
Hmm, it's cute when boring people fight.
But come on, let's say we get out of here.
I'll show you around.
We'll start on the port side and work our way around to the whiskey side.
She really was hot though, wasn't she ?
I would die !
Grace, you're being silly.
Danielle's a friend.
I've known her for years.
Besides, she's not even my type.
Please, she's everyone's type.
I'd do her.
All right, l-l-let me just picture that for a minute.
- Stop.
Would you take this seriously ?
- No !
Because nothing's gonna happen.
Look, when we got married I took a vow for better, for worse.
There were some other things in there I wasn't quite following because I could see your thong through your dress.
I love you.
You're right.
You're right.
I'm crazy.
Go.
Save the world heal the sick and just don't forget to get me a present.
And a real present this time.
Not one of those native crafts like you brought me from Africa.
I want something that comes from a real store with a real receipt.
How 'bout I just give you some cash when I get home ?
That'll work too.
Bye.
What ?
I see what you're up to.
You planned this whole thing.
What are you talking about ?
This !
The boat, the sun, the lotion.
Getting me to take my blouse off.
It was all a clever ruse on your part to get with me.
Well, you caught me, Jack.
It was all part of my master plan.
First, I arranged to have Stan die so I could have him cremated and thrown from this boat where I persuaded the sun to shine so I could lure you on deck and rub lotion on your creamy Hey, lovers, I hate to interrupt the honeymoon but we're just about to scatter Stan's ashes.
And, Will, there are three things I want to tell you.
One I really appreciate your being here.
What are the other two ?
Oh, when you sit like that I can see your man berries.
What are you wearing ?
Why aren't you dressed ?
What ?
We're on a boat.
We're scattering the ashes of a dead man and you're dressed for Salma Hayek's pool party.
I don't think Karen really cares what I'm wearing.
It's the fact that I'm here that counts.
Well, if everybody's ready we should get started.
I wouldn't want Grace to be late to the MTV beach house.
I didn't know !
How did everyone else know ?
Because we know how to act in these situations.
And because Will dressed me.
Thank you all for being here today.
This was one of Stan's favorite spots.
He spent many an afternoon doing cannonballs off of the side of this boat.
He destroyed an entire ecosystem and created that small chain of islands.
I'd give anything to be with you again.
One more dance, one more kiss.
One more night in our box at the opera giggling at the frightened faces of the people sitting below us.
But I guess that's never going to happen again.
Listen, guys.
I'm sorry.
I think I need to do this by myself.
Would that be okay ?
Sure, Kare.
We'll go open a bottle of champagne and drink a toast to Stan's memory.
Grace, maybe you want to slip into a coconut bikini.
Yeah, speaking of coconuts how 'bout a longer bathing suit ?
I've been going like this all morning.
You can go too, Ro-Ro.
I'll be inside if you need me.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without ya, Stanley.
I don't know what I'm gonna do without him, either.
Wh ?
How the hell did you get here Dame Judi Wench ?
I made a deal with your driver.
He promised to let me stowaway in his cabin if I'd let him stowaway in my capri pants.
Good Lord.
How many men are we going to share ?
Get the hell outta here !
Look, I just came here to say one last good-bye to Stanley.
And to give him this.
Oh, my God.
It's, it's Stanley's favorite toupee.
I knew he couldn't rest in peace without his piece.
His mother gave him this for his sweet 16.
Thank you.
I know that he would have wanted to have this.
Perhaps in the next world they can convince him to wash it.
Oh, God, I'm gonna miss him.
Me too.
- Would you like to - No, that's okay.
You do it.
You get some air under that thing it really moves.
Ah, the sea life.
Isn't it romantic ?
I wish we both had dates.
Or if only one of us could have a date I wish it was me.
What's the matter Grace ?
You okay ?
I was just thinking about what a shmuck I was.
Leo's not gonna cheat on me.
I mean, look at me.
I'm a freakin' bombshell.
Yes, I believe it was Rita Hayworth who said "a woman is only as beautiful as the amount of food she keeps in her teeth".
I am a bombshell.
I'm gonna go visit the poop deck if you know what I mean.
This place is dead.
What should we do ?
I believe there's a new gay bar that just opened up right over there.
Let's go.
I like holding your hand.
It's almost as soft as Stanley's.
You know, for a scheming, husband-stealing skanky whore, you're good people.
Listen, I know you've kind of fallen on hard times since Stanley left you nothing in his will.
Is there anything I can do for ya ?
Well, you can start by giving me some of that bloody money.
I'm not kidding.
- Forget it !
- Why not ?
Well for starters, I don't know how you'd even begin to divvy up something like $985 million dollars.
Listen, you drunken sea hag.
I spent the better part of a year with that man Tell him what his feet look like.
Tell him what his knees look like.
I deserve something.
You deserve something.
Well, how about I let you keep screwing my driver ?
Oh, and do me a favor, don't kill him.
We need to get home.
Ooh, oh !
I love this song !
Mornin', Driver.
Ma'am, I think your husband left his bag.
Oh, this is Leo's.
Thank you, Driver.
Shoot.
Hope there's nothing in here that he needs.
"To Leo" ?
This looks private.
Leo, we're going to be spending a lot of time together in the next few weeks and I have to say something in this letter.
I could never say to you in person.
I want you.
OhmyGod.
You have to know that you can have me whenever, wherever.
And when that time comes know that I am going to Until you beg me to stop.
I can't wait.
Love, Danielle.
That bitch.
