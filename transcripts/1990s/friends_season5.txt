{START OF EPISODE 1}
Friends, family, we're gathered to celebrate the joyous union of Ross and Emily.
Now, Ross, repeat after me.
"l, Ross".
I, Ross.
"Take thee, Emily".
Take thee, Rachel.
Shall I go on?
He said, "Rachel," right?
Do you think I should go up there?
Yes.
Yes.
Do go on.
I think we'd better start again.
Repeat after me.
"l, Ross".
I, Ross.
"Take thee, Emily".
Take thee, Emily.
Like there'd be anybody else.
"As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health till death parts us".
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health until death parts us.
Really, I do.
Emily.
Do you have the rings?
Place this ring on Ross' finger as a symbol of your bond everlasting.
Ross, place this ring on Emily's hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.
Happy to.
They have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Just keep smiling.
Well, that went well.
It could've been worse.
He could've shot her.
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
The One After Ross Says "Rachel" You spoiled everything!
It's a nightmare!
My friends and family are out there!
How can I face them?
No matter what happens with them we still get cake, right?
That's all right.
You take your time.
I'll be right out here.
She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you!
And I love you!
A bad time to say the wrong name, huh?
That's true.
Thanks, Dad.
People should be dancing.
This is a party!
Come on!
Joey!
Dance!
Yes, Waltham lnteriors.
This is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Filangie.
Who?
I discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine.
Without it, in the brain of Ross women's names are interchangeable.
Through no fault of his own.
Oh, my God!
Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe.
Dr. Filangie.
Oh, no!
You have it too!
What kind of bitch hangs up on a doctor?
I hope you don't take this the wrong way but I know we had plans to meet up tonight.
I'm worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know.
-How could we have let this happen?
-Seven times!
You know, look.
We were away.
In a foreign, romantic country.
I blame London.
Bad London!
So look while we're still in London, we can keep doing it, right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
But when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
I'll meet you there in two minutes.
Mon?
I gotta ask you something.
Now?
Ross said my name.
I can't just pretend it didn't happen.
I don't know.
Monica, what should I do?
Just do the right thing.
What?
Tow the line!
Thread the needle!
Think outside the box!
I'll talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
Wait!
Rachel, no.
He's married.
Married.
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Okay.
You're right.
You're right.
You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault?
Were we bad parents?
Who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
How are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
You and me, next dance?
Sorry, dear, I only dance when I'm drunk.
Want me to get you something?
We were supposed to meet.
-Forget it.
That's off.
-Why?
The next tour of the wine cellar will commence in two minutes.
Joey, what are you doing?
You promised, no meat till Phoebe has the babies.
We're in another country, so it doesn't count.
-True.
-He's got a point.
I'm sorry things aren't working out.
It could be better.
It'll be okay, right?
Oh, yeah!
Of course.
She'll get over this.
So you said my name.
You just said it because you saw me there.
If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said: "l take thee, Circus Freak".
It didn't mean anything.
It's a mistake.
It didn't mean anything.
Right?
Oh, no!
Of course it didn't mean anything.
I can understand why Emily thought it meant something because it was you.
But it absolutely didn't.
It didn't!
It didn't!
The band's ready for your first dance with Emily.
Oh!
The band's ready!
We've got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!
You spit on me, man!
I'm sorry.
Emily is taking kind of a long time.
When I locked myself up at my wedding I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Get the hell out of there.
You know?
I'm coming in!
Oh, look at that.
Same thing.
In the middle of everything, if I scream, "Yippee"!
just ignore me.
-Oh, my God!
Rachel!
-Oh, hello, Rachel.
Ross said my name.
Okay?
My name!
Ross said my name up there.
That obviously means he still loves me!
Don't believe me.
I know I'm right.
Do you guys want to go and get a drink?
Yes, we do.
But we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change.
-Go get a table.
-We'll only be five minutes.
Fifteen minutes.
Oh, Phoebe!
It's Phoebe!
-Oh, hey, hey.
-Oh, great.
So, what happened?
Well, Ross said my name.
But I don't think that means anything.
Let's look at this objectively.
Ninth grade, right?
The obsession starts.
Then he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
His obsession begins to grow, right?
Why don't we go change in my room?
My clothes are.
Wow, you look No time for that.
Hey, dude!
Let me in!
I got a girl out here!
I got a girl in here!
No, you don't.
I saw you go in with Monica.
Well, we're hanging out.
Which one of us will be having sex in there?
Me or you?
I suppose I would have to say you.
-What if we're watching a movie?
-Which we are!
And we've paid for it.
It's My Giant.
My Giant?
I love that movie!
Think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't going to use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful!
I don't feel right about this.
This is the honeymoon suite.
The room expects sex.
The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Nope!
Not under here!
-You didn't find her?
-I've looked everywhere.
You couldn't have, or you would've found her.
-Keep looking!
-Yeah!
For about 30 minutes?
Or 45?
In 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't, because I kept moving.
From now on, I'm staying in one place.
Right here.
-It's getting late.
-We're going to go.
Do you guys mind staying here for a while?
We've got to get up early and catch that plane.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we'll stay here with you.
Thanks, guys!
I really appreciate this, but you don't need to rub my butt.
We have to leave in an hour.
I know.
I've been looking at those doors.
They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
We can't do that.
That's insane.
I mean, A, he could wake up.
And B, you know Iet's go for it.
Nope.
-She's not with us.
-We've come for her things.
Where is she?
She's in hiding.
She's humiliated.
She doesn't want to see you again.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
But I think you're absolutely delicious!
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.
Oh, yes.
There you are.
Hurry up!
Get some!
There's a whole cart outside.
Goodbye, Geller.
Now, hold on.
Hold on.
Your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
Tell her I'll be at that airport, and I hope she will too.
I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
She's just a friend.
Tell Emily I love her and I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her.
Come on, bugger face!
Call me.
You spend your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the window?
Maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.
Technically, we still are over international waters.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Maybe I'll see you there?
Can I ask you something?
Felicity and I watched My Giant.
And I thought: "I'll never be as good an actor as that giant".
Do you think I'm wasting my life with this acting thing?
The giant's five years younger than me.
You think I'll ever get there?
-Thanks, man.
-Okay, man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now.
Who knows what science will come up with in the future but what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?
You've been in the bathroom for a half-hour.
I know!
Had the beef tips, huh?
You ate meat!
You had sex!
No, we didn't.
I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.
I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off and making me fat.
-I'll say hi to the chick and duck.
-Me too!
Why would you need to?
You've been feeding them.
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll just go home.
We certainly are alone.
Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
Listen, since we're on that subject I just wanted to tell you that.
I was going through a hard time in London with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
Well, anyway, I just.
That night meant a lot to me.
And I'm trying to say thanks.
You know, that night meant a lot to me too.
It wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.
It just meant a lot because you're really hot.
Is that okay?
That's okay.
And I'm cute too?
And you're cute too!
Thank you.
All right, I gotta go unpack.
I'm still on London time.
Does that count?
-Oh, that counts!
-Oh, good!
What are you doing here?
I've been on standby for a flight home for hours.
So no sign of Emily?
Not yet.
When do you have to leave?
This is the last call for flight 1066 to A thens.
The last call.
Pretty soon, I guess.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
How could she do this?
Am I a complete idiot for thinking she'd actually show up?
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
All passengers for flight 1066 to Athens should now be onboard.
I get it!
Well, that's that.
No, you know what?
I think you should go.
I think you should go by yourself.
Get some distance.
Clear your head.
It would be really good.
I don't know.
Come on.
It would be really good for you.
I could do that.
I can't even believe her.
You know what?
I am going to go.
-Good.
-Why not?
-Right?
-Right.
Thanks.
I'll see you back at home.
If I ever get a flight out of here.
What?
Wait, what?
Why don't you come?
I mean, I have two tickets.
Why not?
Well, I don't know, Ross.
Really?
Yeah.
It'd be great.
I mean, you can.
You can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage.
You see how I make jokes?
Really.
I mean.
I could use a friend.
Oh, wow.
Maybe.
Yes, I can do that!
-Cool.
-All right, cool.
Okay, we're going to Greece.
I forgot my jacket!
Well, you tell them to wait.
Wait!
Wait!
I'll have a glass of Merlot and he'll have a wine spritzer.
Look!
The airport's moving.
Are we moving?
Are we?
Why are we moving?
Does the captain know that we're moving?
Oh, my gosh!
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
You look cute in bubbles.
You're just all liquored up.
Hey, it's me.
I'm coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
-You're home early.
-Yeah, my date threw up.
Want some chicken?
No, thanks.
No chicken.
Bye-bye.
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!
All right.
Are you okay?
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Could I get a three-piece, some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
Diet Coke.
The One With All the Kissing -Morning, Phoebe.
-I have to tell you this story.
I was coming over and this cabdriver Was his name Angus?
What?
He was a cabdriver we had in London.
All right.
Anyway What was that pub he took us to?
The Wheat Sheaf!
And they had that beer.
Boddington's!
Phoebe was going to tell a story.
So he had a really funny hat.
I don't want to talk about it.
-Hey.
-Hey, Ross!
Boddington's!
Oh, man!
I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
They have them at the British pub by the Trade Center.
Later!
Shouldn't Rachel be back?
Her plane got delayed.
But she should be here by now.
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?
No.
But she likes me.
You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
I did not "abandon" Rachel.
Okay?
Emily showed up at the airport.
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.
She's my wife.
Rachel is my wife.
Emily!
Emily is my wife.
Man, what is that?
You haven't heard from Emily?
Not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can outrun you.
Hey!
She's fast, okay?
You think you can beat me?
Let's go!
Outside!
-I'm sorry.
I'm just a little -Slow?
Oh, you want some?
!
Okay, get the shoes on!
Let's go, man!
It's cool, okay?
You're the fastest!
-Hi!
-Oh, my God, Rachel!
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.
That's it?
You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.
Terrible?
Hell, I was in Greece!
There was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.
It's not too shabby for Rachel.
So, what, that's it?
We're cool.
Totally cool.
Thanks, Rach.
You're the best.
Oh, no.
You're the best.
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
No one will tell me where Emily is so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red roses to her parents' house.
One for each day I've known and loved her.
That should get her talking.
When you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "Emily".
It's good that you had such a good time in Greece.
What?
I didn't have a good time in Greece!
Ross abandoned me!
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!
People came up to me going, "Mrs. Geller!
Why are you cry"?
I mean, it was so humiliating!
I felt like such an idiot!
It's all my fault.
You know why?
Because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!
London is stupid!
Stupid!
I put on a cheerleading outfit to seduce Joshua.
Then I lost him because I asked him to marry me after four dates.
And then I went to Greece on somebody else's honeymoon.
Okay?
Do those sound like very good decisions to you?
I like your little braid.
I just shouldn't be allowed to make decisions anymore.
Phoebe, you were right.
I should've never gone to London.
From now on, you make all my decisions for me.
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.
I'm not comfortable having that power over someone's life.
I'll do it.
Fine.
Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.
Okay.
I got to go to work.
And Rachel, great to have you back.
Always a pleasure.
Rachel?
Sweetie, look.
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.
He's married.
Ross is married.
I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I'll just have to accept it.
I mean, it's my fault.
Edges!
Fingers!
Smudgy!
Oh, my God!
That's okay.
I know that you're very upset right now.
I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
If you'd stop thinking about Ross you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.
Look.
Gunther.
He's nice.
He's cute.
Yeah.
I guess Gunther is.
What about that guy over there?
That's the guy you flirted with at the counter.
-Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.
-You're going to talk to him.
I make your decisions, and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right.
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.
Say that to him, and you're golden.
Hey, Phoebe.
We got our pictures back from London.
Here's all of us at the Tower of London.
Here we all are.
There's Ross and Joey and you and And me.
We've been talking about London too much.
Sorry, it's just because I couldn't be there.
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry.
Know what I like to do?
It sounds a little corny but sometimes when I'm bummed out, I like to just close my eyes and think about what a wonderful gift life is.
See?
-What happened?
-A little of this, a little of that.
I got myself a date tomorrow.
See?
Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.
Get out.
What took so long?
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.
So thanks for having me over.
See you, man.
What the hell was that?
Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European.
It felt French.
Well, I guess it's time for me to say goodbye too, mon frere.
Come here and give me a little sugar.
I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.
I guess this is it.
Unless you want to come inside?
Wait a minute.
You know what?
I can't decide this.
Okay.
Just hold on a second.
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.
Doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today.
It's 72 long-stemmed red roses.
One for each day I've known and loved Emily cut up into mulch.
Honey, that's awful.
It's not so bad.
Monica's going to make potpourri.
I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
It's not raining.
I can't catch a break!
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.
I'll make you some tea and we'll talk this out.
All right?
Hey, Dave.
I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.
Okay.
Bye!
Honey, listen.
I know things seem so bad and that they won't get any Could I talk to you?
I dropped some socks.
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?
You did not drop any socks!
I saw Dave, and he said you blew him off!
You listen to me!
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
What are you doing?
Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted to tell him that I'm still in love with him.
What?
You cannot tell him that!
Why?
Why not?
People love to hear that!
Come on, I love you.
-Wasn't that nice?
-No.
I make the decisions and I say no!
You know what?
No, you don't make my decisions, because you're fired.
You can't fire me.
I make your decisions, and I say I'm not fired!
Ha!
Well.
Come on, let me in!
Having some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
Ross, there's something I wanna talk to you about.
-I just need to -Rachel, open this door!
-What, is it locked?
-She's fine.
Listen.
Rachel, I can do this all night if I have to!
-You want me to get that?
-No.
Just let her do her thing and we'll do our thing.
Because I really need to tell you Thank you.
Rachel?
Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
We really need to talk.
Well, then talk.
Okay, I will.
Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
What thing?
Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.
And who knows who she might end up hurting?
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.
I have to use the phone.
I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
My God!
Think of the massacre.
I'm going to do it.
I know you think I'm crazy.
But before you tell him, try to find one person who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.
Please?
All right.
Fine.
Joey!
I'm in!
All right.
Good deal.
-Hi.
-Hey, Rach.
-Did you find anyone who agrees with you?
-No.
But you know what?
I think I need a male point of view.
Joey.
-You're a man.
-You got that right.
Do you think it would be a good idea if I told Ross that I was still in love with him?
Nope.
-Phoebe!
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Phoebe?
-Yeah.
You know how you were saying you didn't get to go to London and you were feeling left out?
Well, we all felt really bad about that so we decided to take a little trip together!
Oh, that's so nice!
How great!
Where's the trip?
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic in Central Park!
Central Park?
All of us.
All day.
That sucks!
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.
What'll we high-five about at the stupid park?
It's right by my house.
All right!
I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
I wanted to talk to you about this whole new European thing you've got going on.
And I need to say it makes me very uncomfortable and I just, you know, just stop it!
Just bringing some culture to the group.
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.
It makes me want to puke.
Hey, everybody!
Phoebe is here!
-Phoebe!
Woo!
-Okay.
Woo!
Hi!
Phoebe, we decided that the picnic idea was a little.
It didn't have any.
Well, it blew.
We thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City!
Oh, that's a great plan!
Whose plan was that?
Mine!
-Wait.
It was my plan.
-No I said we needed a new plan.
And I came up with Atlantic City.
Which is the new plan.
Why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour.
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.
Well, I think I'm gonna grab some coffee because my ass is already packed.
Let's go.
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.
Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
You know what?
That doesn't matter.
Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them and not have them say it back?
I don't care.
I can't watch.
What you reading?
Paper.
Yeah?
What's it about?
Events from around the globe.
There's something I have to talk to you about.
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.
Once at work I thought carbon dating is fossilized I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Go ahead.
I think I'm just going to say it.
I'm just going to say it.
I'm still in love with you, Ross.
I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What?
Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.
I'm so dead serious!
I'm totally serious!
Why are you laughing?
Because I just heard it!
I heard it.
And it's ridiculous!
I mean.
You're married!
You're married, and it's just ridiculous!
When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel.
I was like, "You are such an idiot"!
-Well, I am married.
-I know.
Though I haven't spoken to her since the wedding.
I'm sorry.
That's not funny.
Actually, it kind of is.
My wife won't return my calls.
I don't know where my wife is.
"Hey, Ross!
Where's the missus"?
"Don't know"!
Oh, God!
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?
Well, I kind of have to.
Because the thing is The thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
Oh, God.
Things won't be weird between us, right?
Was that stupid?
Me telling you that?
I'm glad you did.
If nothing else it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said!
-Thank you for being so nice.
-No.
Thank you for.
Thank you.
Oh, God.
I'm just glad I didn't give you the cassette I made of all of our songs.
-What songs?
-Oh, you know: -"With or Without You".
-Oh, yeah.
-"Everybody Hurts".
-Oh, yeah.
-"Rhiannon".
-Why "Rhiannon"?
Come on, you remember!
In the living room?
On Monica's laundry?
Not me.
Really.
So, what happened?
Well, it was really hard but I'm glad I did it.
So was I right or wrong?
-Oh, come on, honey, does it really matter?
-No.
Yes.
I need it for my score book.
Diary.
-Okay, let's go!
-Yeah, Atlantic City!
Come on!
Atlantic City, baby!
Let's roll some bones.
Hey, Joey!
High-five for rolling bones.
Phoebe, you're leaking.
Oh, my God!
Your water broke!
Oh, okay.
Well, don't worry.
I call shotgun.
Phoebe, we have to take you to the hospital now.
Okay.
Well, there's probably one on the way to Atlantic City.
Phoebe, the babies are coming now.
Honey!
High-five!
The babies are coming!
Remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies!
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.
I can't believe I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room.
It's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
-It's all right.
-Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
I'm Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out.
Have you started having contractions?
Not yet.
I heard they really hurt.
Do they?
Oh, my God!
Which of you is the father?
None of them are.
The father is my brother.
I'll miss watching you freak people out like that.
This is for the babies to look at someday.
Do you want to say anything before it starts?
Hi, kids!
It's me, Aunt Phoebe.
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me!
What took you so long?
Your cab left when ours did.
We went back because I forgot my jacket.
You're not wearing one.
Oh, man!
I did it again!
Someone has to call Frank and Alice.
My mom might What are you doing?
I've got to get the "before" shot!
The One Hundredth We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late is because she's not coming.
She hit her head in the shower.
Oh, my God.
She's so stupid!
Phoebe, it's gonna be okay.
I don't see three kids coming out of your vagina!
Listen.
The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
He's head of the department.
All right.
Oh, dear God, save me!
I'm having my first contraction!
Oh, it's not bad.
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And l You okay?
Something hurts.
It's sympathy pains.
That's so sweet!
I didn't know I cared that much.
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.
I'll be back to do your internal.
Just relax, everything looks great.
And also, I love Fonzie.
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
All right.
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?
Delaware.
Until she gets here, I'll be your coach.
Don't worry.
She told me about the LaMazda stuff.
If you get the babies out by month's end you get two percent financing.
Monica, you're gonna be very proud of me.
I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh, my!
They're male nurses.
Not in my head.
They want to take us out Saturday night!
What do you say?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about?
You've been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
I'm moving on and so are you.
Why don't you want to go?
Why don't you give me a good reason and I'll tell you if it's true.
-What?
-Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
You're coming.
And when they get off we'll go get some Jello with them.
There's always room for Jello.
How do you make that dirty?
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.
Grandma's chicken salad.
Get a shot of this.
These are the headlines when you were born.
Now, girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies check it out!
This is what naked women looked like when you were born.
Now let's dive into the good stuff.
Okay, I'm having another one!
This one doesn't hurt eith Yes, it does!
I was kind of hoping that was it.
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Really?
Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates.
-When?
-I think Saturday.
-What's with him?
-Sympathy pains.
It was sweet at first, but now I think he's trying to steal my thunder.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This Fonzie person you keep referring to is that another doctor?
Oh, no, no.
Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli.
The Fonz.
All right.
It's not that weird, is it?
It's very weird!
I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo".
He doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie What are you doing?
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor who isn't crazy and doesn't Fonzie!
Again, it's not Hey, there you are!
There's something you should know.
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.
I am so fine.
You and l, we're just nothing.
Just goofing around.
I was about to tell you I was getting out of it.
But if we're just "goofing around," maybe I will go out with him.
Fine.
Maybe I will too.
Hey!
Look what I found in the gift shop.
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
This is Dr. Oberman.
He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
You're going into what grade?
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.
Me too.
I should have specified I'd need a grown-up doctor.
Really, I'm fully qualified Doogie!
Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon?
Go, little boy!
Go!
Oh, cool.
You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Or.
Kidney stones.
-lf it was something else?
-Well, that would be "kidney stones".
You're getting there.
These babies are very, very lucky.
They are?
Why?
They'll be born on the Fonz's half-birthday.
Happy Birthday.
Just to clarify I'm not Fonzie.
It's a terrific thing that you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
No, it is.
Can I tell you a secret?
I want to keep one.
Oh, I'm gonna be on the news.
You must be kidding.
You know you can't keep one of these babies.
Maybe I can.
You don't know.
I do.
Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
Maybe not.
You know?
Three babies are a handful.
Maybe they'll want to unload one.
I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
Phoebe, no.
This is insane.
Just ask him.
What?
Me?
I can't ask him!
Do you know how inappropriate that would be?
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.
Just feel him out.
No.
I will not ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Feeling better, sweetie?
Maybe a little.
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.
I just heard.
What's up?
Kidney stones!
Ordinarily, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
But they're too close to the bladder.
Either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra No, no, no, no.
Nothing is going up, okay?
Up is not an option.
What's a urethra?
Are you crazy?
Did you ask him?
No, I haven't had a chance yet.
I'm kind of on a clock here.
Oh, Fonzie.
You know who I always liked?
Mork.
Undo it.
Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork.
Mork froze Fonzie.
But Fonzie was already cool.
So he wasn't hurt.
Right?
Yeah, that's right.
How you doing?
Okay.
Doctor says any minute now.
You know, Alice is going to be here so soon.
You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
Sorry, I'm in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
This is Dan, one of the guys we're dating on Saturday.
Nice to meet you.
I'm really looking forward to Saturday night.
Really!
So, Dan nurse, not a doctor, huh?
Kind of girlie, isn't it?
That's okay.
I'm doing this to get through medical school.
And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
Sure.
Thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.
Great!
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?
-No.
-All right, very good!
This is a big one.
Get these things out of me!
Breathe!
Breathe through the pain.
I want the drugs, Ross!
I do too!
I do too!
Yeah, I love you.
Okay, bye.
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.
She should be here.
She'll make it on time.
So, Frank three babies.
That just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.
Fair enough.
You're at ten centimeters.
Time to start having babies.
I want only the father here.
-We love you.
-Good luck.
I need a clamp, a sterile towel and Channel 31.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, no!
It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.
Ready?
Time to try pushing.
Ready?
Time to try peeing.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.
Push.
Concentrate on pushing.
I see the head.
Yes, it has a head!
Keep pushing.
Come on.
I can't believe somebody's coming out!
There's somebody coming out of you!
-It's my son!
-All right.
Here's your first baby!
Yes!
We got a baby boy!
Frank Junior, Junior!
How does he look?
So gross!
Okay.
You ready to push again?
I already had a baby.
Leave me alone!
Come on, you can do it!
You can do it!
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!
Oh, my God!
I can't believe I have two children.
How scary is that?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born.
He's coming!
Yes, he's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh, God!
Kindergarten flashback.
They read the sonogram wrong, because they thought it was a boy.
But Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it.
-Am I too late?
-No, no.
Everything's okay.
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
We have our babies.
Oh, my God!
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small.
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Great.
Are you really going to date that nurse man?
You and I are just "goofing around".
I thought, why not "goof around" with him?
I don't know if you've looked up "goofing around" in the dictionary.
Well, I have and the technical definition is: Two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together.
But if you have this new dictionary that gets you mad at me then we have to get you my original one.
I am so bad at this.
-You're better than you think you are.
-Really?
Okay.
So if?
-Know when to stop.
-I sensed that I should stop.
So we're okay?
I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen.
-Don't do the dance.
-Right.
You're my favorite.
-Which one do you have?
-I don't care.
Frank and Alice want me to tell you they're making phone calls.
Did you talk to them about, you know.
No, honey.
It was a long shot.
You guys?
Can I just have a second alone with the babies?
So here you are.
Seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that petri dish.
Everyone said labor was the hardest thing.
But they were wrong.
This is.
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.
I wish I could take you home and see you every day.
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.
Okay, so we're cool.
We're gonna be great.
Little high-fives.
Well, if you're going to cry.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!
I know.
Does it hurt as bad as they say?
You won't be able to take it.
Now that little Chandler is a girl, what'll they name her?
They'll call her Chandler.
Kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
It works on you.
Maybe they can girlie it up a bit, like Chandlerette.
Alice called her Channy-fanny.
Ha-ha, Channy-fanny.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Come in.
I've been waiting for you.
Hi, I just Oh, my God!
Monica!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry!
I was I was taking a nap.
Since when do you take naps in that position?
Tell me you were waiting for a guy.
Please tell me.
Yes, I was.
A guy.
From work.
I'm seeing a guy from work!
That cute waiter guy that looks like a nonthreatening Ray Liotta?
That one!
Give me a second.
I'm just going to grab a jacket.
When I get back, I want every little detail.
Maybe that's him.
It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you at the movie?
Ross was so loud, they threw us out.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
-He's talking to London.
-Did he get in touch with Emily?
No, not yet.
He's hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
Way to suck up to the family!
I'm so glad you're all here.
My office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!
The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS Hi, is this Nanny Hopkins?
I'm looking for Emily.
Waltham.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is this 0-1-1-4-4-7-4-2 9-3-4-7-4-2-6-7?
Oh, it's "4-3," not 4-2.
Well, which 4-2?
No, no!
Vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux?
Who vomited on?
You know what?
What you up to, Joe?
They're doing this telethon thing on TV.
And my agent got me a job as cohost!
That's great!
A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.
That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.
Oh, PBS!
-What's wrong with PBS?
-What's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS?
Right after my Mom killed herself, I was in a bad place, personally.
I thought I'd write to Sesame Street.
Because they were nice when I was a little kid.
No one ever wrote back.
A lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain, and by that time, I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry, Phoebe.
I wanted to do a good deed, like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed.
You just want to get on TV.
This is selfish.
What about you having those babies for your brother?
That's selfish!
What are you talking about?
It was a nice thing, but it made you feel good, right?
Yeah, so?
It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.
Look, there's no unselfish good deeds.
Sorry.
Yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless!
May I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's You know, there's No, you may not!
Because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?
Are you calling you people?
Sorry to burst that bubble, Phoebe, but selfless good deeds don't exist.
You know the deal on Santa Claus?
I'll find a selfless good deed.
I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
Oh, my God!
It's Emily!
It's Emily, everyone!
I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives.
Goodbye.
You can hang up, but I'll keep calling everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me.
Really?
About what?
Look, you're my wife.
We're married.
You know, I love you.
I really miss you.
I miss you too.
At least, I think I do.
She's talking.
When you said "the deal with Santa," you meant?
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Yeah, she might have mentioned him.
So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?
I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to it.
I want to meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.
Really?
That's what you heard?
You said that?
I might have.
Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him.
And you!
You lucky dog!
She's willing to work on the relationship.
That's great!
In London.
She wants me to move to London.
But you live here.
You know that.
-What will you do?
-I don't know.
-I mean, I can't leave Ben.
-You can just video-conference with him.
I'm not ready to have a child.
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan I could convince them to move to London with Ben.
I'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move so you can patch things up with your new wife.
It could happen.
Ross, we are not moving to London.
We already have lives here.
But it'd be great.
They have great theater great accents.
Tea.
They have a queen.
-So?
-She's a woman.
-Daddy!
-Hey!
Guess what?
We're moving to London!
-Who's going to London?
-Nobody's going to London.
Welcome to London, governor.
Right, right.
It'll be great because we'll have Big Ben and little Ben in the same city.
Go pack!
See?
See, he wants to go.
Yeah, we leave all our big decisions to the 3-year-old.
Come on, come on.
It'll be just like Three's Company only there's a kid and my wife and you're the gay ones.
How you doing?
Welcome.
Good to see you.
This'll be your phone.
That's great.
But I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No, you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host.
Gary Collins is the host.
You'll be answering the phone.
You don't seem to understand.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Well, here's your phone, doctor.
I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.
You know that old guy that lives next to me?
I snuck over there and raked up the leaves on his front stoop.
But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.
Then I felt wonderful.
That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right.
Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed.
I gave birth to three children and I won't let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!
Can I ask you a cooking question?
If you're cooking on the stove that means your new boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Is he?
I think I'll respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.
Why?
If this guy was me and it's me who'd learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had I'd be like this: All right, Emily.
As much as I love you I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
Would you consider moving here?
You were moving here anyway.
Why can't you just do that?
I don't know.
It's just But I know that even though I've been a complete idiot up till now you have to come here.
You have to, so we can work this out together.
All right.
Did you just say "all right"?
I did.
Now I'm the idiot.
Emily, that is so great!
It'll be great!
We're going to be like two idiots in love!
There's one thing that really scares me still.
-Yes, tell me.
-You must understand how humiliating it was for me at the altar in front of my family and friends.
I know.
I am so sorry.
And then, after deciding to forgive you seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.
It drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.
I love you.
All right.
I'll come to New York, and we'll try to make this work.
That's so great!
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
I asked Emily if she would come to New York.
And she said yes.
Great!
Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
What?
You can't What did you say?
I'd think about it.
How am l supposed to make this decision?
I'm actually asking you!
Rachel is one of your best friends.
But Emily's his wife!
That's true!
You can't just cut Rachel out of your life!
That's true!
Thanks for the help.
Problem solved!
When will you be on TV?
There was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office but I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
How about now?
There he is!
Hello, New York!
Maybe just put the whole duck in there.
Who cares?
Now I got the legs.
How many times have I told you to never watch the cooking channel?
I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed.
That was yours?
We used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Williams-Sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.
Joey's at the telethon for the rest of the day.
We have the place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Maybe you'd want to book some time with "the best you've ever had".
You know what, champ?
I think I'll pass.
Why?
What's your point?
With all the stupid gloating, would you want to sleep with you?
Well, I think I'd be a little out of my league, but I'd give it a shot.
PBS Telethon.
I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed.
I went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What good is that going to do?
It helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.
The bee is happy, and I am definitely not.
You know, the bee probably died after he stung you.
Damn it!
Back on in 30 seconds, people!
Excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
No way.
I'm in the shot, man.
-You've been here all day!
-I'm taking pledges.
And we're on three, two.
Welcome back to our fall telethon.
If you've been enjoying Cirque du Soleil and you'd like to see more, it's very simple.
All you have to do is call in a pledge and tell one of our volunteers what type of programming you -Quick broiling pan question -Yes, it really does cost that much.
Maybe next time your duck can puke in something from Pottery Barn.
That's it.
I cannot make this decision.
It is too difficult.
I leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.
A Magic 8 Ball?
You can't make this decision with a toy!
It's not a toy.
I don't know what else to do!
I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends or I get divorced for the second time before I'm 30.
If anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.
Because I got nothing!
Don't be shy.
Any suggestion will do.
Okay, then.
Here we go.
Magic 8 Ball should I never see Rachel again?
"Ask Again Later".
Later is not good enough!
"Ask Again Later".
What the hell?
This is broken!
It is broken!
Let me see.
Will Chandler have sex tonight?
"Don't Count On lt".
Seems like it works to me.
Okay, one more time.
Should I never see Rachel again?
Magic 8 Ball!
What did you ask?
Does Rachel get to pick the movie that we're all going to see tonight?
Excellent.
What's the answer?
Looks like Stella's gonna get her groove back tonight!
What?
I heard it was good.
PBS Telethon.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, Phoebe.
I'd like to make a pledge.
I would like to donate $200.
Two hundred dollars?
You sure?
After what Sesame Street did to you?
I'm still mad at them, but they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.
By supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.
So there!
A selfless good deed.
You don't feel good about donating the money?
No, it sucks!
I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster?
Those things are, like, $10.
Not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.
Thank you!
And the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.
Oh, boy!
And may I say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look!
Joey's on TV!
Isn't that great?
My pledge got Joey on TV!
That makes me feel so Oh, no!
Look I got carried away before, but there's something you got to know.
If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
Keep talking.
I was nothing before you.
Call the other girls and ask.
Which wouldn't take long.
But when I'm with you, and we're together oh, my God!
-Really?
-Oh, my God!
I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
But that would be wrong.
We're too good.
We owe it to sex!
If we owe it!
Oh, my!
When will Joey be home?
I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.
No, no, no!
Leave the gloves on.
I cleaned the bathroom.
Why don't we lose the gloves.
All right.
Let's show them how it's done.
-You know that wasn't part of it?
-I know.
You ready?
We're going to be late.
-For what?
-For Stella, remember?
She's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.
I totally forgot about that.
Can I take a rain check?
I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure, I guess.
I hear you don't have to go to London.
It's not that easy.
There's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Just stuff.
You know, kind of what Emily wants.
Talk to me.
Maybe I can help.
You can't help.
I have to do this without your help.
I know you can do that too.
I'm just saying if you need to talk.
Thanks.
Whatever it is that Emily wants just give it to her.
The bottom line is that you love her.
Fix whatever she wants fixed.
Just do it.
You're going to have to try.
You'll hate yourself if you don't.
Come on, answer it!
Hi, sweetie.
Good.
Yes, I've been thinking about that thing you wanted me to do.
I can do it.
Will you come to New York?
-Never done that before.
-Nope.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
What time is it?
Nine.
But it's dark out.
That's because you always sleep till noon, silly.
This is what nine looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then.
Watch that sunrise.
I'm getting tired of always sneaking around.
Me too.
What if we went away for the weekend?
No interruptions.
We could be naked the entire time.
All weekend?
That's a whole lot of naked.
I'll say I have a conference and you can have a chef thing.
I wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
Okay.
You know you're not, though.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
Wait.
What about Joey?
The One with the Kips I'm going to a culinary fair in Jersey this weekend.
How weird!
Chandler just said he's got a conference there.
That's funny.
Seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
Do you want people to think it's fake?
It's a real conference.
- Is Rachel here?
- No, she's out shopping.
- Damn!
- What's going on?
I told Emily to come.
And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute.
When Emily comes, you won't see Rachel anymore?
I'm focusing on the "I get to see my wife" part and not on the part that makes me do this.
So you'll never be in a room together?
How will that even work?
I have no idea.
I mean But I assure you, I will figure it out.
It doesn't seem like it'll work.
Hi, guys.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.
That's better than my way.
Hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Oh, man.
Oh, look!
A letter from my mom.
So, Rach?
You know how Emily's coming?
Oh, yeah.
I know.
Can you hear anything?
Yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything"?
Hey, Joey's ass.
What are you doing?
Remember when they fought and broke up and we were stuck here all night with no food?
When Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it'd happen again.
So I hid this in here.
Candy bars, crossword puzzles "Mad Libs"!
Mine!
Condoms?
You don't know how long we'll be in here.
We may have to re-populate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway, it all boils down to this.
- The last time I talked to Emily - Oh, my God!
Our dog died!
- What?
- Oh, my God!
LaPooh, our dog!
LaPooh's still alive?
It says he was hit by an ice-cream truck and dragged for nineteen blocks!
- Oh, my God.
- Sweetie, we heard you crying.
- Please don't cry.
- It's LaPooh!
I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
I can't believe it!
We're here!
Chocolates on the pillows!
I love that!
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.
I'll be right back.
Oh, yes!
Get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
Oh, dear God!
They gave us glasses!
The glasses have lipstick on them.
Who knows what else they didn't change?
Sweetie I just want this weekend to be perfect.
We can change rooms, can't we?
Okay, but let's do it now.
Chopper Five just lost its feed!
You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh, yeah.
I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
Well, there's this one thing.
Here goes.
I made a promise that - What?
- Your nose is bleeding.
Oh, God!
You're bleeding.
Not again.
This happened when my grandfather died.
Sorry.
Gross.
Okay.
So I'm sorry.
What did you want to tell me?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I can't see you anymore.
I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either.
- I think you'll like this room more.
- Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank?
Still lots of high-speed chasing to do!
- We're switching rooms again.
- What?
Why?
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.
Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me.
Can I talk to you over here for just a second?
These clowns want to take us for a ride.
I won't let them.
We're not a couple of suckers.
I hear you, Mugsy.
All these rooms are fine.
Just pick one so I can watch the Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?
- This one I like.
- Nothing.
Nothing.
It's over.
Damn it!
This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off?
Do we really want to spend the weekend like this?
Am I getting in the way of the room-switching fun?
Don't blame me for tonight.
Who should I blame?
The nice bellman?
Or the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on half a tank of gas?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.
What's the matter?
I just want to watch a little television.
Jeez, relax, Mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon".
I've been wanting to tell you something and I just have to get it out.
Okay.
What's up?
You know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy!
You can't do that.
What are you going to tell her?
Oh, my God!
You've already agreed to this.
It's awful, I know.
But I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
And I do.
I have to make this marriage work.
I have to.
But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
Lucky me!
Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!
That's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been.
This is so hard.
Oh, yeah, really?
Is it, Ross?
- Let me make this easier for you.
- What are you doing?
- Storming out.
- It's your apartment.
Yeah?
Well, that's how mad I am!
Damn Rolos!
You're back!
How was your conference?
It was terrible.
I fought with my colleagues for the entire time.
Are you kidding with this?
So your weekend was a bust?
No, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
You're back too.
Could I talk to you for a second?
- How was your chef thing?
- It was awful.
Some people don't appreciate good food.
Maybe the food tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
How much was the room?
I'll pay my half.
Fine.
$300.
$300?
Just think of it as $25 per room.
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
You know what?
Now that I think about it I constantly find myself without 20s, and you always have lots.
You should've seen the look on her face.
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.
- You want my advice?
- Yes.
Please.
- You won't like it.
- That's okay.
You got married too fast.
- That's not advice.
- I told you.
I'm going to the bathroom.
If anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Me neither.
Maybe I could do it.
I know you guys heard about me and Ross.
But I've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
I don't know if this falls under that category but Ross is right back there.
- That's not Ross.
- Not that guy.
He does look like him, though.
Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh, my God!
It's happening.
It's already started.
I'm Kip.
Yeah, you're not Kip.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares?
You're Rachel.
Who's Kip?
My old roommate.
We all hung out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.
When they broke up, you all promised you'd stay his friend.
And what happened?
He got phased out.
- You won't be phased out.
- Of course, I am.
It won't happen to Ross.
He's your brother, your college roommate.
It was just a matter of time.
I just assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
You live far away, you're not related.
You lift right out.
Hey, Mr. Bing.
That hotel you stayed at called.
Someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes, that was mine.
I figured you met a girl and she left it.
That would have made more sense.
I don't even feel like I know you anymore.
All right, I'm just going to ask you this one time.
Whatever you say, I'll believe you.
Were you or were you not on a gay cruise?
I'm sorry about the whole "lifting out" thing.
You got to come with me.
- Where?
- Wherever I go.
You and me, we'll start a new group.
We're the best ones.
Okay, but try to get Joey too.
Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone?
Sure.
Bye, Ross.
Forever.
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the rules?
I talked to Monica.
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
I'm the one who's making things change.
So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
No, no, it's okay.
Really.
Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving their college roommates at reunions and Joey at Burger King.
Is that better?
No, it's not better.
I still don't get to see you.
What would you do?
If you were me, what would you do?
First, I'd have said the right name at my wedding.
I can't believe this.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Hey, Rach?
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said you want to talk to me about a trip?
I just came over to drop off nothing.
So that weekend kind of sucked.
Yeah, it did.
So I guess this is over?
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.
Chandler, that's crazy.
If you always gave up after a fight you'd never be with anyone longer than This isn't over?
You are so cute!
No, no.
It was a fight.
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.
Really?
Okay, great!
Welcome to an adult relationship.
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so.
I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Saw him waiting for an elevator.
Can I use your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.
It's in the bathroom.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
Yes.
You?
And you?
But you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.
But how?
When?
- It happened in London.
- In London!
We didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!
You can't.
We just don't want to deal with telling everyone.
Please just promise you won't tell.
All right.
Man, this is unbelievable!
I mean, it's great!
But I know.
It's great!
I don't want to see that!
We're so stupid.
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe".
"If you win, slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe'"!
That's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.
- But it doesn't count.
- For what?
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.
- I got to go.
- Fun's over.
Wait, if we follow the rules it's still fun and it means something.
I'm going to take off.
Guys, rules are good!
Rules help control the fun.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
None of that.
Not while you're under my roof!
Just because I know about you doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition?
I'm sorry I'm not a middle-aged black woman.
I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
If I pretend to not know about you then you pretend there's nothing to know.
Sorry.
I can hear that!
Rachel's at work.
I can still hear you!
The One With the Yeti What's that?
My mom sent me an heirloom that belonged to my grandmother.
Can you believe it?
A year ago I had no family, and now I have heirlooms!
The only heirloom I ever got was a feather boa.
Got if from my dad.
He got it from his dad.
How did I ever get born?
Oh, God!
Soft.
Is this mink?
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?
I have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
Just Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.
I made that up.
You can't put up flyers in here.
How come?
Everybody else does.
You can't.
What is that?
I'm getting rid of some things.
This is all of your things.
Yes, it is.
It's good.
Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
Stuff that's just ours.
Together.
Brand new.
So it's a get-rid-of-anything- Rachel-ever-touched sale.
Touched, used, sat on, slept on.
I'll take it all.
You're okay with that?
If I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, it will be fine.
Isn't that a little extreme?
After what I did, can you blame her?
You got off easy.
When my friend's husband said another name in bed she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
I guess I'm lucky Emily is not magic.
Oh, she is.
We all are.
What is he doing?
Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?
Calm down, Joey.
Everything's getting all messed up!
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
We won't stop seeing Rachel.
Hence, Ross stops seeing us.
I hate this.
Everything's changing.
We're losing Ross.
Joey said "hence".
I'm not happy about this either, but if Ross says he's happy then we have to keep our feelings to ourselves.
Are you cool with that?
But, you know, I'm an actor.
I'll act cool.
Probably be some of the hardest acting I've ever done.
Maybe I'll play it with a mustache.
Storage rooms give me the creeps.
Please hurry up, honey.
If you want little round waffles, wait till I find the iron.
I want the little round waffles.
Here it is!
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
Is the best place to put something that cooks food underneath poison?
You know what?
I'll have toast.
Fog him!
Fog him!
I don't know what to do about this coat.
I'll take it.
That might work.
What do you think?
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
No, it's just a bit sudden.
It's great, okay?
I am totally onboard.
I love you too.
All right, bye.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
No, actually great news!
I just spoke with Emily and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
Why?
Her thought is, and I agree fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
Her cousin has a place to sublet.
It's got a view of the river and Columbia.
That's way uptown!
That's three trains away which is great!
I love to ride that rail.
You're okay with this?
It's kind of far from work but I'll get so much done on the commute.
I've been given the gift of time.
That's so funny.
Last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum.
Now he's moving?
Man, what is Emily doing to him?
He's not even here!
You guys!
We were in the storage area, and we saw this creepy man.
It was this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.
It was like a Big Foot or a yeti or something.
He came at us, so Rachel used a bug bomb on him.
I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
Like, dark hair, bushy beard?
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Please!
We did not fog Danny.
Who's Danny?
Danny just moved in.
He just got back from a four-month trek in the Andes.
Nice fella.
He's nice.
You know, you always stick up for the people we fog.
You might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.
We're really sorry we fogged you.
Just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
We thought you were like a yeti or something.
Sorry to bother you, but we can't accept your acceptance of our apology.
It doesn't really seem like you mean it.
That guy is so rude!
Really!
What is with that guy?
You'd forgive me if I fogged you.
You did, a little bit.
Oh, my God, honey.
I'm so sorry.
-I totally forgive you.
-Really?
You know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris?
Sure.
He said he would cremate my fur coat for free if I bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Look at these pelts!
Don't get too attached.
She's having it cremated.
You're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it.
We all do.
But if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature.
Not nature.
Fashion!
This is fashion?
So to you, death is fashion?
That's funny.
Here's Phoebe sporting cutting-edge hairy carcass from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.
You really think this looks good?
Because I do!
I miss you too.
I can't wait to see you.
I love you.
Bye.
What is in here, rocks?
No, it's my collection of fossil samples.
So, rocks.
I'll miss this apartment.
You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.
Remember when I ran into this and it knocked me out?
I love this place.
To tell the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
If Emily gave me a choice You do have a choice!
Why are you listening to her?
Are you crazy?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do.
She's totally Stop pinching me!
You guys said to keep my mouth shut if Ross was happy, right?
He just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?
We all hate Emily!
No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
We just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes, unreasonable.
Unreasonable?
How about we have this conversation when one of you marries?
You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
It's compromise.
Do you always like it?
No.
Do you do it?
Yes.
Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky coffee at Central Perk.
It's real life, okay?
It's what grownups do.
I think he's right.
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
-I feel so guilty about Ross.
-I know.
I kind of feel like it's my fault.
Kind of?
You should have kept this to yourself.
I'm keeping so many things to myself, something was bound to slip out!
I think it's very brave what you said.
I can't sit here anymore.
I have to walk places.
What's with the coat?
How about the animal rights thing?
I've been reading up, and for your information minks aren't very nice.
-So they deserve to be killed?
-Well, they are real bad.
Okay, I admit it.
I love this coat, okay?
It's the best thing I ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley.
Remember Phil Huntley?
He was fine.
So you like the short hair better?
Yeti?
Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the fogger smell.
Listen, I'm so sorry.
I would have never fogged you if you hadn't looked so.
Absolutely.
Some people are just into appearances.
What?
It's cool.
No, that is not cool.
You don't even know me.
You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalog.
From that, you've got me all figured out?
Well, you don't.
You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
Do you?
You know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
Stop saying that.
I hate that!
I judged you.
I made a snap judgment.
But you did it too, and you're worse.
You're sticking to your judgment.
You can't even open your mind to see you might be wrong.
What does that say about you?
That pizza place across the street any good?
I'm hungry.
You want some pizza?
You can keep yelling.
Stop saying that.
I hate that.
Are you still mad?
Good!
We have an "I'm Sorry" song.
You know what?
I'm not in the mood.
Look, Ross.
I feel really bad.
You're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
-We are so sorry.
-You're stepping on the song.
We were way out of line, all right?
We totally support you.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Now you're just taking lines out of the song.
This is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.
Yes, exactly!
And that's why.
Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make your favorite dinner.
Thanks, you guys.
Are you wearing fur?
Let's get some perspective, people.
It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
You know, I think I kind of understand why I lost it today.
You do, huh?
You see I'm an actor, right?
So I got to keep my emotions right at the surface.
I got a lot of balls in the air, you know?
It's tough.
Guys like me, you wander around, you're alone.
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Look at you!
Where have you been?
I went to have pizza.
With Danny.
-What happened?
-That yeti is one smooth talker.
Yetis are smooth-talkers.
That's why you never see any pictures of them.
"Come here, baby.
Give me the camera".
I hope you're not full.
Dinner's almost ready.
I think I'll probably just hang out in my room.
Why?
Come on, you guys!
If Emily knew I was having dinner with you, she'd flip out.
It's okay.
I really don't mind.
Wait, wait.
You know what?
Just stay.
Please.
It would mean a lot for me if you stay.
Ross, I just Please, just have dinner with us!
Settle down.
All right.
I'm sorry.
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
Hey, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's back.
We haven't seen him in so long.
Oh, God!
I really missed that fat bastard.
This is so weird.
I realized this may be the last time we hang out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it.
Hi, Emily.
You tracked him down.
Hold on.
Yeah, we're just having dinner.
Sure, hold on.
She wants to say hi.
Hi, Emily!
Hello, everyone.
So who am I saying hello to?
Well, I don't know about who's here but I can tell you who's not here, and that's Rachel!
I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.
You know what?
Rachel is here.
She's there?
Oh, yeah, there she is!
She's here.
Take me off speakerphone.
How could you do this to me?
I made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.
I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
-You can't keep away from her.
-That's ridiculous.
-Hello?
Hello?
-Who is this?
It's Ross.
What are you doing?
Sorry, dude, I had to make a call.
Joey.
Joey, they don't have two lines, they have two phones.
Gotcha.
I'm sorry.
Emily, listen.
I have never cheated on you.
I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
Please, get on the plane and come to New York, okay?
You're the only one I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there.
I can know where you are all the time.
You can't know where I am all the time.
This marriage will never work if you don't trust me.
You're right.
Can you trust me?
I think it's going okay.
Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell?
You can only see his back.
You can totally tell!
Here, look, watch me.
Smile.
Frown.
Smile.
Frown.
Smile.
I guess that's it.
Why?
What happened?
My marriage is over.
Look at you, you're shivering.
Here.
Honey, is there anything we can do?
You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Stop tormenting me!
This is mink, okay?
They're mean, and they hate squirrels.
Most of these probably wanted to be coats.
Fine.
No, I get it.
Here.
You take it.
Are you happy now?
I'm cold!
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
No, look.
That's a pig.
I know.
But look at the knobs on it!
Emily's cousin kicked me out.
-What?
-Why?
When you sublet from your wife's cousin then you divorce, sometimes the cousin wants his apartment back.
Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
You can stay with us.
Anything you need.
But you have to let us know when you feel better so we can make fun of your hair.
You got it.
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
I'm going to get packing again.
I've been moving around so much that I feel like a nomad.
-What?
-He thought you said gonad.
The One Where Ross Moves ln If every place were this clean, it'd be tough making a living.
Oh, Larry!
Do health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
-It's okay to laugh?
-I was just kidding.
-I'll check the kitchen floor.
-Knock yourself out.
I don't get violations.
You could eat beans off that floor.
But don't, because that'd be a violation.
Yummy!
Yeah, I'd let him check out my kitchen floor.
A ninety-eight.
I deducted two points for not wearing your hat.
That is a Section 5 violation.
Now look, Larry, honey.
I wrote the book on Section 5.
You only need to wear it in the kitchen.
-Where's your hat?
-ln the kitchen.
I'll get it.
There's the two points!
You should really read that book you wrote.
You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew she'd go in hatless to get it.
You could have your own health inspector detective show.
I don't know about that.
But then I could be your sidekick, Voonda.
Maybe I could ask Voonda to dinner sometime?
She would love that since you know all the clean places to eat.
I'll call you.
He's so funny!
Thank you.
How's Ross doing since all the Emily stuff?
He's not great.
But he's dealing with it.
Wait, you're not I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again.
He'll be screwed up for a long time.
Besides, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
-Two pounds of mocha java.
-It's Danny.
Are you going to go out again?
I don't know.
He hasn't called since we went out.
I see him in the hallway.
We flirt.
I'm all: And then nothing.
Wow, thirsty.
I'm having a party on Saturday.
Sort of a housewarming thing.
-Fun.
-Great!
I'm looking forward to it.
See you!
So I guess we won't be warming his house.
All right, I see what he's doing.
He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
And you won't do that.
That's right!
Because that would give him the control.
So now he comes up with this "I've got a party" thing to get me to hint for an invitation.
Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So there is no party?
No, there's a party.
There's a party.
But the power?
That is still up for grabs.
You follow me?
I think so.
So he won't invite you to his party because he likes you?
Exactly!
Then why didn't he invite me?
To throw me off.
Hey, roomies!
I love what you've done with the place.
I know it's a lot of boxes.
-I appreciate you letting me stay here.
-Not a problem.
Since you'll be here a while we could put your name on the answering machine.
I hope you don't mind but I kind of already jazzed it up a little.
Check it out.
We will We will call you back Pretty cool.
-You're fake laughing too, right?
-The tears are real.
You look beautiful this evening.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny.
You mind if I wash up?
Who knows where these have been?
You are just nonstop!
-We're out of here.
-Why?
I saw 1 0 violations.
I'm shutting this place down!
-You have the power to do that?
-This does.
Shut it down.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You built a fort, didn't you?
Kind of.
Oh, my God!
The air purifier.
Ross' air purifier.
All I heard for four years through college was.
You should have gone out once in a while.
-I hate this thing!
-Come on, Chandler.
Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.
So why don't you be a grownup and come watch TV in the fort?
Can't believe that Larry closed down Churman's.
I love that place.
You should have heard about all their violations.
Larry said that they should call it Vermin's.
That guy just plain kills me.
I wanted to invite you to the party.
Thanks, I'll try to stop by.
Actually, I think I'm going to be busy.
You are?
Remember, I've got that gala?
What's the gala for?
It's a regatta gala.
Do you sail?
No, but I support it.
I hope I see you tomorrow night.
Take care.
Walked right into that one, didn't he?
What one?
You wanted him to invite you and he did.
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes he'd know I had nothing better to do than wait for his invitation.
But I said no which puts me back in the driver's seat.
So the ball is in his court?
Ball?
No, there's no ball.
Hey, Phoebe, you want to join us?
-Oh, sure, yeah.
Where is this from?
-It's from Sun Ling's.
Oh, Larry just told me something about Sun Ling.
Oh, no, thank you.
Joey, please.
Sorry.
Hello, children.
You want to play some foosball?
Please?
We moved the table into my room because of all the boxes.
Come on!
I have one question.
What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing.
You mean this.
I don't know how much more I can take.
Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
My God!
What if that had been porn?
All right, this may be tough but it's Ross.
I survived college with him.
I guess I can hold out a little longer.
Let's have a game.
Fellas?
So he's out of here.
Got anything to eat?
I went to Jono's and it was closed.
I took Larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.
If this guy keeps closing our favorite places, where will we eat?
I don't know.
Clean places?
Yum!
It's Danny.
Don't let him in!
I'm supposed to be at a gala.
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?
What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?
The fake kind.
-I need a ladle.
You got a ladle?
-We have a ladle.
See you at the party.
You know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle".
I'm done.
You want anything?
Sports?
International?
Apartment listings?
I'll take sports.
Mine!
All right, international.
That's mine too.
I'm ltalian.
I could check apartment listings, though there's never anything here.
Not even on page seven?
You're right.
Here's an affordable place.
Two-bedroom, close to work.
It's available in five weeks.
What about that circled one?
It's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Let's go look at it!
There we go!
Guys, would you chip in for some new air filters for the purifier?
I mean, after all, we are all using it.
Let's go quicker!
Oh, my God!
Look at this kitchen/bathroom.
That's great!
So you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head.
Let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it.
I don't know.
Maybe we should keep looking.
But this place is available now.
You don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.
So you think I should take this place?
It's perfect!
How about you?
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
I see what you guys are saying.
I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him.
Could we get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Ready for dinner?
-Absolutely.
-Great.
You wanted to go to the ltalian place on Bleecker St.?
I love that place!
So, no.
How about Mama Lozetti's?
Sure.
How long has that milk been sitting out?
No, this place is totally healthy.
This milk is mine.
I bought this today because I was thirsty for milk, you know?
Okay, let's go.
Hey, buddy.
Health Code 1 1 B requires that refuse be taken out the back exit.
But then I have to go all the way around.
So you choose convenience over health?
Would you be interested in a free coffee?
Stop, Larry.
Can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
It was exciting at first.
But now, it's like, so where are we going to eat ever?
I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go, go!
If, after dinner, you still need to bust someone I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe we did good, helping Ross get back on his feet.
That was a nice place.
No closet space, but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag.
What do we do?
I don't know.
Maybe pizza?
About Ross!
It's the apartment manager.
Ross put us as references.
Ross is the greatest guy.
He's very reliable Of course, he has a big, huge dog that barks into the night.
Well, who doesn't love dogs?
He's a tap dancer.
Yes, some would say that is a lost art.
He's a pimp!
There you go.
He's a pimp.
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!
-Okay, honey, I'm ready.
-What are you doing?
I am going to wander into the party and I will be all, you know: "l don't need this, I'm coming from a regatta gala".
Did you get this out of a book?
Monica, honey, this is as real as it gets.
This is never going to work.
He's right there.
Just go say hi.
I have to go downstairs and back up, as if I'm coming home from the gala.
So just go distract him.
But don't be sexy.
What's going on?
This is a great party.
Great food.
You know, most parties, it's all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
So.
What's this?
Salad.
And what's this?
Bread.
Aren't you a chef?
Right, tonight was your party.
You look great!
I'm glad you made it.
Well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.
Whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball.
Come on.
He's glad I came.
He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
Ball's flying all over the place.
This is my friend, Tom.
This is the girl I told you about.
Come on!
You telling people about me?
I think you two could really hit it off.
I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's?
My mom calls it "Bloomies".
At ease, soldier!
I'm sorry?
You can just drop the act.
I know what's going on.
You're Danny's wingman, right?
You guys are best buds, frat bros.
I'm going to go talk to a friend.
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
Go tell him, "Nice try".
He just keeps lobbing them up and I keep knocking them right out of the park.
I think I need a drink.
Ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred!
Okay.
Go.
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Here we go, here we go.
So I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.
You're kidding?
But Phoebe said I could stay at her place for a while, so.
Well, you can't stay with Phoebe.
We're roomies.
You don't need me taking up all your space.
We got plenty of space.
There's still some by that speaker.
Please, just stay.
Are you sure?
-Definitely.
-You have to stay.
So I'm a pimp, huh?
It's okay.
Sometimes I can be a pain in the ass.
But just talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.
And I'll do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just.
Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
The cowboy hat's a little much.
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Stop talking crazy, and make us tea!
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Monica, that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever.
It was so good.
I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
Does anyone want to watch TV?
Monica, your remote doesn't work.
You have to lift it and point.
Oh, forget it.
Let's play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.
I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Very nice.
The other day, I was at the bus stop and this lovely fall breeze came and blew this chick's skirt up.
Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
The One with the Thanksgiving Flashbacks It's not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering.
It's amazing how much they can do with so little material.
And they play with your mind.
Is it there?
Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know.
Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction?
And I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry.
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
You can't swoop in with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
You're not going to tell about your parents' divorce again, are you?
Come on!
I want to hear it.
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
It's a tradition, like the parade.
If the parade decided it was gay and abandoned its family.
Now, Chandler, dear just because we're getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you.
It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
Every time you tell that story, that guy's accent gets thicker and thicker.
So are he and your dad still together?
No.
After they got their own place, the houseboy got his own houseboy.
Should have heard his accent.
You're right, yours is worse.
You're the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I've got one that's worse.
Really?
Worse than, "More turkey, Mr. Chandler"?
Did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler?
Yes, mine's worse!
More bandages!
More bandages!
Please, can I get some more bandages in here?
This man is In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life.
Oh, okay.
No, Chandler's is worse.
It must be cool remembering stuff like that.
I don't have any past-life memories.
Of course, you don't, sweetie.
You're brand-new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Let's not tell this story.
I know!
It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
It's not like it sounds.
It's exactly like it sounds.
What's going on?
Oh, my God!
I know!
It's stuck!
Step.
How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler.
Oh, my God!
Monica's going to totally freak out!
Help me get it off!
Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a dead animal's ass.
Did you get the turkey?
Oh, my God!
Who is that?
It's Joey.
Is this supposed to be funny?
It's not supposed to be funny.
It's supposed to be scary.
Get that off now!
I can't.
It's stuck!
It has to feed 20 people.
They're not going to eat it off your head!
Hold on.
Let's just all think.
I got it!
You pull.
I'll spread the legs as wide as I can.
Now is not the time.
Count to three.
One two three!
It worked!
I scared you!
I knew it!
I'm here, big guy.
Yeah, you are!
I scared you!
You did look like an idiot.
I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot.
Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash" and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?
Yeah, that's the same.
That's it.
That's my worst Thanksgiving.
That can't be the one Rachel meant.
She didn't even know that happened.
So, what's yours?
I really don't want to tell this story.
Reliving pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.
For me, anyway.
And, of course, the lndians.
Of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.
What is that supposed to mean?
-Monica, I think Rachel's here!
-I'll get it!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Not for me.
Chip and I broke up.
Why?
What happened?
My parents are out of town, and Chip was going to come over.
And you were going to give him your "flower".
Monica, can you just call it sex?
It really creeps me out when you call it that.
And by the way while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness".
Believe me.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Everyone this is Chandler.
My roommate and lead singer of our band.
This is Monica.
I'm Ross' little sister.
I'm so glad you could come.
We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
I'm so glad you brought him here.
I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it.
Damn it!
Does it feel weird around here now?
You know, since I've been away at college?
Not really.
That's cool.
So that's Rachel, the girl you've been writing all those songs about?
Might want to rethink the lyrics to "She Feels Weird Since I've Been Gone".
I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson!
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.
His begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
I've just had it with high-school boys.
They're just silly.
They're just silly, stupid boys.
I'll start dating men.
I'm sorry, Judy.
I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
It was great.
You should be a chef.
Guess what.
All this stuff about Nancy being a slut was all a rumor.
Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house!
-That is so great!
-I know.
Oh, gosh.
Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight promise me you'll tell me everything.
Totally.
It's not that big a deal.
We already kind of did it once.
But now you'll definitely know whether or not you did it.
I know.
And Chip promised that this time it'd last at least for an entire song.
I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.
"Emotional Knapsack"?
Right on!
But don't take long.
We're testing our fake lD's tonight.
Right, Clifford Alvarez?
Listen, Roland Cheng if things go well, I may be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that to me.
It's cool, you can stay here.
My parents won't mind.
It's not that.
I just don't want to be stuck here with your fat sister.
Why don't you finish off these pies?
I don't have any more room in the fridge.
No, thank you.
Judy, you did it.
She's finally full!
I called you fat?
-I don't even remember that.
-Maybe it'd jog your memory if you guys played a little bit of "Emotional Knapsack".
I'm so sorry.
I really am.
I was an idiot back then.
I rushed the stage at a Wham concert, for crying out loud!
I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry.
That is terrible.
I'm so sorry.
That's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was.
No, it was actually Thanksgiving's over.
Let's get ready for Christmas.
I have the cutest Christmas story.
We want to hear Monica's story.
Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but, you know, whatever.
You changed your major again?
I had to.
There was never any parking by the psychology building.
Love your new nose!
Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
He removed my mole cluster.
Want to see?
No!
Please, let me.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Your hair sure is different.
We were just talking about that.
We can't believe how stupid we used to look.
Where's Monica?
She's upstairs.
Come down, everyone's here!
Ross, Rachel and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Oh, my God!
What's the matter?
Is there something on my dress?
You look so different.
Terrific.
That dress, that body.
-Dude!
-Sorry.
Yes, she's thin.
It's wonderful.
But we really want to hear about Ross' new girlfriend.
Her name is Carol.
She's really pretty and smart.
She's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.
Can you believe it?
She plays for both teams.
So I guess I'll see you at dinner.
-Dude!
-Sorry.
Oh, my God!
That was so awesome.
You got him back for calling you fat.
He was drooling all over you.
-That must have felt so great.
-lt didn't.
Yeah, I mean, I look great.
I feel great, and my heart's not in trouble anymore.
I just don't feel like I got him back.
I just want to humiliate him.
I want him to be naked, and I want to point at him and laugh.
That, we may be able to do.
How?
Guys tend to get naked before they're going to have sex.
What?
I didn't work this hard and lose weight just so I could give my flower to someone like him.
First of all, if you keep calling it that, no one will take it.
And then second of all, you're not going to have sex with him.
You'll just make him think that you are.
I'll throw him out in the yard, lock the door and all our neighbors will just humiliate him!
You'll definitely get him back.
How do I make him think I want to have sex?
Here's what you do.
Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean?
Anything can be sexy.
Like this dish towel.
This feels so good against my cheek.
And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.
Or I can bring it down to my side and run it through my fingers while I talk to him.
I can do that.
Good, good, good.
Get busy.
He's coming.
Hey, what's up?
Could you make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year?
I'd love to.
I love macaroni and cheese.
I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
And I love carrots.
Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.
Like this.
And hold them down here while I talk to you.
And, you know, if I get really hot I like to pick up this knife.
And I put the cool steel against my body.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
Twenty-year-old male.
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.
Could you please not do that feet first?
You know where his injury is.
Severed toe, you just said it!
It says the knife went through your shoe.
They're made of wicker!
Did you bring the toe?
I have it right here on ice.
Toes on Ice, coming soon to Madison Square Garden.
Save your strength, man.
Don't worry, son.
We'll just reattach it and then.
What is it?
You brought a carrot.
This isn't your toe.
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?
Oh, my God!
There's a toe in my kitchen.
I'm sorry!
I'll go get it!
All we can do now is sew up the wound.
Without my toe?
I need my toe!
I can go really fast!
Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
I'm not falling for that one.
That's why I lost my toe?
Because I called you fat?
I didn't mean to cut it off.
It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
I'm sorry.
It wasn't your whole toe.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.
It's the best part.
It has the nail.
Sir Limps-a-lot.
I came up with that.
You're a dork.
-I can't believe this.
-I said I was sorry.
"Sorry" doesn't bring back the piggy that cried all the way home.
It figures that something like this would happen today.
I hate this stupid day and everything about it!
I'll see you later.
Wait.
Come here.
Is there anything I can do?
Anything?
Just leave me alone for a little while.
I'm a duck.
I go quack-quack.
I'm happy all the time.
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica This is not going to work.
I bet this will work.
You're so great.
I love you.
Nothing.
I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
You said you loved me.
I can't believe this!
No, I didn't!
Yes, you did!
No, I didn't!
You love me!
No, I don't!
Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Gauze!
Gauze!
I need to get some gauze in here!
Can I please get some more gauze?
This is getting ridiculous.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world?
Dock of the bay?
I'm out.
Oh, undies!
Whose are they?
-Whose are they?
-Not mine.
Joey's!
Got to be Joey's.
They're mine.
See, Joey's.
They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.
Why are they here?
I don't know.
I'm Joey.
I'm disgusting.
I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Get them out of here.
What's wrong with you?
-Take them!
-I got them.
You can touch them.
They're yours.
Chandler?
A word?
I'm tired of covering for you two.
This has got to stop.
Tighty-whiteys?
What are you, 8?
Thank you, Joey, so much.
You're not welcome, okay?
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.
Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom.
I said it was mine, and that I was playing a woman in a play.
Then one thing led to another, and.
And around the ankles, that is a tough spot.
It was.
All right, listen All this lying has been hard on us too.
Yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier.
Yeah, actually.
Meanwhile, I get Rachel shoving your underwear in my face and asking when she can come see me star in Ugly Woman.
We'll be more careful.
We don't want them to know because it's going really well.
And maybe it's going well because it's a secret.
It sounds weird, but we're so bad at relationships.
-We are.
Help us!
-Help!
All right.
But you do it with me once.
-Joey!
-Didn't think so.
The One With Ross' Sandwich -Can we please just drop this?
-But I don't get it.
Does anybody else just take off their underwear when they're hot?
What are you reading?
Wuthering Heights.
I have to finish it by tomorrow for my literature class.
You're taking a class?
That's so cool.
I really liked that Lamaze class I took.
I thought this time I'd go for something more intellectual with a less painful final exam.
That sounds like fun.
Oh, you should come with me!
Then I'll have someone to sit with.
Do you have time to read it?
I read it in school.
This is going to be so much fun!
I have to finish.
But what time does the class start?
What's wrong, buddy?
Someone at work ate my sandwich.
What did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.
I can't believe someone ate it.
It's just a sandwich.
Just a sandwich?
I am 30 years old, okay?
I'll be divorced twice and I got evicted.
That sandwich was the only good thing in my life!
Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
That's a nice sweater vest.
I have enough for one more sandwich.
I was going to eat it myself, but.
Mon, that would be incredible.
Thank you so much.
I still can't believe someone ate it!
Look, I left a note and everything.
"Knock-knock".
"Who's there"?
"Ross Geller's lunch".
"Ross Geller's lunch, who"?
"Ross Geller's lunch.
Please don't take me.
Okay"?
I'm surprised you didn't wear it home.
Want to keep your food?
Scare people off.
I learned that on the street.
Really?
What would you say, Phoebe?
Stuff like: "Keep your mitts off my grub".
Do you picture Phoebe on the street with the entire cast of Annie?
This'll keep them away from your stuff.
Phoebe, you are a badass!
Someday I'll tell you how I stabbed the cop.
He stabbed me first!
The Bronte sisters were remarkable women for their time.
They lived in a patriarchal society.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
So, what is the book about?
Didn't you read it in high school?
I started it, but then there was this pep rally.
And I was on top of the pyramid.
But anyway what's the book about?
It's a tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff.
It takes place on these creepy moors in England.
Which I think represent the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book?
Let's see.
Rachel Greene?
I would have to say that it's a tragic love story.
That's sort of a given but, yes.
Anyone else?
Symbolism!
And the wildness of the moors which I think, is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
Excellent!
What Rachel has shrewdly observed here.
You completely stole my answer!
Honey, that was pretty obvious.
How would you know?
You didn't read it!
What do you think?
You in the blue shirt?
I think that yours is a question with many possible answers.
Would you care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating me?
Are you just repeating me?
All right.
Let's move on.
Okay, then.
Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?
I didn't want him to think I was stupid.
That was really embarrassing, what happened to you.
Your note?
Amazing!
Not only did no one touch my sandwich but people at work are actually afraid of me.
A guy called me "Mental".
"Mental Geller".
I've always wanted a cool nickname like that.
The best you got in high school was "Wet Pants Geller".
It was the water fountain, okay?
!
Anyway people are writing reports for me pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
I tell you, you get tough with people and you can get anything you want.
Hey, Tribbiani!
Give me that coffee!
Now!
This was really fun.
I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.
So you still wondering?
No.
We just went out.
You're smart.
I like that.
Oh, candles!
What is that, a blanket?
A video camera?
Oh, my God!
I can't believe you thought you'd tape us having sex on the first date!
Joey, is what she just said.
Oh, my God!
You're actually going What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room.
What are you, sick?
I'm Joey.
I mean, I'm disgusting.
I make low-budget adult films.
You promised to be more careful!
The good Joey name's been dragged through the mud!
We're so sorry.
I'm telling everyone.
It's the only explanation that doesn't make me look like a pig!
No, there's a better explanation.
Tell them you had to make an adult film for your adult film class.
I like that.
But no!
How does that explain my underwear at your place?
I don't know.
Get ready to come out of the non-gay closet.
I promise to come up with something.
Just give us time.
All right.
But it better make me look really good.
And another thing: The video camera?
Nice!
May I have a word?
Of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part.
-What?
-Threatening letters refusal to meet deadlines.
Apparently people now call you Mental.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
You don't understand.
This is so silly.
This is all just because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
I call it "The Moistmaker".
Anyway, I put my sandwich in the fridge.
Oh, you know what?
I'm sorry.
I believe I ate that.
You ate my sandwich?
A simple mistake.
It can happen to anyone.
Oh, really?
Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?
Do you, perhaps, remember seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.
That said it was my sandwich!
Now, calm down.
Look in my office.
Some may be in the trash.
It was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.
You threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?
!
What's this book about?
You didn't read it, either?
I was going to, but I accidentally read something else.
Vogue.
So tell me about Jane Eyre.
No, read it yourself.
Come on, don't be such a goody-goody.
Fine.
All right.
So, Jane Eyre?
First, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?
Isn't that like a robot?
This book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late.
Let's get started.
What did you think of Jane Eyre?
Rachel and I were discussing it, and she had very interesting insights.
Go ahead, Rachel.
Thank you, Phoebe.
What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Well, feminism, yes.
But also the robots.
Since that video camera thing didn't work out I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked!
I know!
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?
On account of my rage.
Which, if I may say, right now is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss, I started to get worked up again.
So he offered me a tranquilizer.
And I thought it was a good idea.
So I took it.
They're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
I don't know.
It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
I hate it when they make me see the shrink at my office.
He's always like, "Your colleagues will like you better if you like yourself better".
Who needs that?
-You do.
-I know.
It's so embarrassing!
I can't believe you let me go on like that!
I'm sorry.
It was so funny when you compared Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.
Come on!
What is the big deal?
I thought it'd be something we could do together.
I thought it would be fun.
Fun is good.
But I also wanted to learn.
People talk about what they learned in high school.
I never went.
So you really wanted to learn.
You know, Phoebe, I just wanted to have fun.
You know who should go?
I know!
I know!
I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh, my God, that's Monica!
You get away from me, you sick, sick, sicko!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
-Oh, no!
-Yes, he has a naked picture of Monica!
He takes naked pictures of us, then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Oh!
Dude, that's my sister!
Give me that!
Wait!
Everybody calm down, okay?
Let's give our friend a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
I am not a pervert, okay?
It's just.
I just kind of.
I think I can explain this.
Thank you.
Joey's a sex addict.
What?
!
No, I'm not!
It's okay!
It's good!
It's a disease.
I am not a sex addict!
Yes, you are!
That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No, it isn't.
It's not.
Because you could also explain it with the truth!
What is the truth?
-What's up?
-What's going on?
I slept with Monica.
Well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.
You slept with my sister?
Yes, but it was We just did it once, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Is this true?
Of course, it's true.
How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes, it's true.
If it happened once, how come we found your underwear in our apartment?
That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London.
Right, Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it as a souvenir.
My God, Monica!
Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica.
She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense.
And the video camera?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
Monica, this has to stop now.
I know, I know.
I know.
I will, and I would appreciate if we all could just drop it immediately, and forever.
Okay.
That is, if you can resist me.
-I'll give it my best shot.
-Good luck.
Unbelievable!
You really kept Joey's underwear?
Why?
Why would you do that?
I'm Monica.
I'm disgusting.
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
I think we've all learned who's disgusting and who's not.
Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
You were making a good point.
I mean, till you got cut off.
What's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know.
I didn't come with her.
Hey, everybody!
Everybody, guess what!
I just convinced Carl to give us a test.
Test?
Come on!
Tests make us all better learners!
Oh, yeah!
We should have essay questions!
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
-What are you doing?
-I reorganized the fridge.
See?
Bottom shelf, meats and dairy.
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
And top shelf, expired products.
Why are you doing this?
Because I'm bored out of my mind.
I've already been to the bank, post office and dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days' worth of stuff.
Spread it out a little.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?
I'm not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical.
Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?
A guy in your position needs to be better at relaxing.
That's why we have comfortable chairs.
Here, sit down.
Ready?
Watch.
And then.
-So, what?
We just sit?
-Oh, no, no.
We're not gonna just sit.
Watch.
-Hello, Chandler Bing.
-Hello, Mr. Bing.
I love you.
All right, whoever this is, stop calling me!
It's been 6 months!
It's not funny!
I can see you, Mr. Bing.
You look sexy in your new suit.
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!
And that's Wednesday.
The One with The lnappropriate Sister Hey, you guys!
Guess what?
The British are coming?
Oh, you and your ways.
Since it's Christmas, I'm going to be collecting donations.
I have my bell and later on I get my bucket.
I'll be spreading joy to the people.
Last year I spread a little joy, but not enough.
So this year I'm doing the whole city.
I knew a girl in high school who did that.
She was very popular.
It's weird, you're starting to sound a lot like Chandler lately.
That is so not true.
So, Phoebe, where are you doing your bell-ringing?
They gave me a great spot right by Macy's.
They never give a good spot to a rookie but I'm the only one who can say "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.
I lied!
Oh, my God.
Here's Danny.
Just watch this.
See?
Still pretending he's not interested.
He's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Danny.
Oh, Danny!
Hey!
You know Rachel.
She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon.
Of course.
Do you want to go out on a date with her?
Absolutely.
Is Friday okay?
Friday is perfect.
She can't wait.
On the date, I'll be able to talk to her directly?
See you Friday.
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what?
Don't answer me.
I have a date with Danny!
All right, it's 4:30, I guess my lunch break is over.
-What are you guys gonna do?
-lf you're going back to work I'll probably just hang out.
You know, make some calls.
How could I not get the part?
The play was about a 29-year-old ltalian actor from Queens!
Well, Talia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
What can I say?
She nailed it!
Is there anything else?
You'll just say no again, but gay porn?
Happy holidays!
Feliz Navidad!
Allo and Merry Christmas!
Oh, thank you, sir!
Here's some joy.
-How's it going?
-It's going okay.
Good.
Let me help you out.
Oh, thanks!
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.
Yeah.
I guess.
Just get your nails done?
Yes, Phoebe, but this is all I have, okay?
Thanks.
Happy holidays!
Here's your joy.
Thank you!
Happy holidays and Wait.
-You can't take money out.
-I'm making change for the bus.
Can't you leave the dollar for the poor?
I'm poor.
I gotta take the bus.
Okay, season's greetings and everything, but still Bite me, blondie!
I'm going to give him something besides joy.
Just I can't believe I didn't get that part.
I'm sorry, man.
What you should do is make something happen for yourself.
You know, like write a play.
Or a movie.
What about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Wait a second.
I could star in it!
Or that.
I can't write.
I mean, I'm an actor.
I could act like a writer.
Here.
But see?
Nada.
I don't have the discipline that it takes.
I can't do it.
I'll help you.
Yeah.
I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
Plus, it'll give me something to do.
You'd do that for me?
Thanks.
We'll start slow.
All you have to come up with tonight is the name of your main character.
-Done.
-And it can't be Joey.
-It's not.
-Or Joseph.
What's up?
I just saw Danny on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Honey, I'm sorry.
You should be.
This is all your fault.
You meddled in our relationship!
You had no relationship!
But I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh, God, stop with the plan!
So what if you saw him with a girl?
That doesn't mean anything.
You'll go out with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about that stupid subway girl.
She was kind of stupid.
You're right.
I'm just going to go on the date.
I'm just going to go on the date.
That is the new plan.
Hurry!
-How do you spell "suspicious"?
-Why?
I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
Chandler Bing, seven!
Chandler Bing, zero!
You're driving me crazy with that.
-I'll stop.
-Don't stop.
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.
Well, you suck.
But at least you suck at a man's game now.
-Want to play?
-I can't play games.
Ross'll be home soon.
I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
So play for 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
All right.
But listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
All right.
All we need is a little lighter fluid.
But be careful.
I want our security deposit back.
We said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Thank you!
Happy holiday.
No, that's trash, young lady.
You can't Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!
The charity's on fire!
Help!
Thank you.
I need that!
What is this?
It's 9:00 in the morning!
All right.
"A room.
A man enters.
He looks suspicious".
That's it?
You're supposed to have five pages done by now including an exciting incident.
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball".
That's the game we played.
It's great.
You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter This is helping your career?
You wanted to be an actor.
Not the creator of "Crazy Lawsuit Game".
You're right.
I'll get back to work.
Shame on you!
You should know better!
Joey needs to work.
Now come on.
You can have this back when the five pages are done.
-I had a nice time tonight.
-So did l. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but my sister's visiting.
-I think she's asleep on the couch.
-Your sister?
Your sister's asleep on the couch?
I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
-I thought I heard you.
-Hey, great, you're up.
Rachel, my sister Krista.
Nice to meet you.
I wish you'd warned me.
I'd have fixed myself up.
-Like it would help.
-You are so bad.
-You are.
-You are.
-You are.
-You are!
You are so dead.
I'm gonna get you.
Come here!
It's very nice to meet you.
Nobody!
Nobody respects the bucket!
You wouldn't believe what people put in here!
Does this look like a garbage can to you?
Does it look like an ashtray?
Does it look like a urinal?
-So you going back out there?
-Yeah, but I won't take any more crap.
No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
Good.
You're tough.
You lived on the street.
I'll go back to being Street Phoebe.
But not totally back.
Street Phoebe wouldn't be friends with you guys.
Can I ask you guys something?
I don't have brothers, so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
-Oh, yeah.
-All the time.
In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
I met Danny's sister yesterday.
-That was the girl on the subway.
-You're kidding.
They were very, you know wrestle-y.
But I guess that's normal?
We don't wrestle now.
Not since I got too strong for you.
Too strong for me?
You wanna go right now?
I'll take you right now, buddy!
You wanna go?
Oh, fine.
Ready?
Wrestle!
Okay, you know what?
Actually, that helps a lot.
Thanks.
Let's go!
The puck drops in 20 minutes!
Joey's not going.
I didn't finish my five pages.
Finish them tomorrow.
Tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Cut him some slack.
If he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
If you think Fireball's relaxing, you've never played.
You're doing this because you're bored.
It's not his fault you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed.
I'm on sabbatical!
Guys, don't fight.
And I'm doing this because I am Joey's friend.
If you were a friend, you'd be doing the same.
So being a friend means being a jerk?
If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Let's settle this over a game of Fireball.
-I'll unhook the smoke detectors.
-Let's settle this right now.
There.
Now no one's going to the game.
-I paid for those!
-You said you would, but you didn't.
Oh, yeah.
We finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera.
The same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?
Remember?
We were jogging and saw that bird.
I wanted to take a picture, but I didn't have my camera.
Chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.
-Damn.
I got it on my pants.
-Here, I'll get it.
We better take them off or the stain will set.
-I want to wear them tonight.
-Oh, great.
Okay, bye.
Oh, my God!
-That was unbelievable.
-See?
I told you.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister?
!
I guess you'll have to cancel your date.
And call their mother.
Wait a minute.
Open your hand.
Let me take a look.
Quarter, dime.
Lint?
Not interested in that.
What's this?
A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!
No drinks near the bucket.
Set it down there and then you can make a contribution.
You can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.
Hi, Bob.
I thought I told you to get out of here!
Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.
We're moving you to a less high-profile spot.
-Ginger's taking this corner.
-That chick can't handle my corner.
Look, either you leave or we remove you.
Fine.
I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.
-I thought we said 7.
-You know what?
Let's skip it.
What?
Why?
You and your sister seem to have a very special bond Oh, great.
That "special bond" again.
Why do women have a problem with my being close to my sister?
-I don't know, but -Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters.
But one has a very masculine energy.
-Are you close?
-No.
They're not very nice people.
I like you.
I think this could go somewhere.
So I'm close to my family.
Don't let it stand in our way.
Well, I don't know.
When you put it that way Danny?
Hurry up.
The bath's getting cold.
I'll see you later.
There's some kids playing in the street.
Want to go give them a project, ruin their day?
If they have a ball, you could stick razors in it and teach them a new game: "Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball".
Hey, guys!
I was at the library.
I already finished my five pages.
Now we can go to the Ranger game last night!
No, dude.
Ross tore up the tickets.
I guess without so many distractions it's easier for you to focus?
Also without somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day!
The important thing is, I finished it.
And I think it's really good.
But it would help if I could hear it.
Would you guys read it for me?
-Yeah, all right.
-All right.
"It's a typical New York apartment.
Two guys are hanging out".
"Hey, man".
"What is up"?
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong.
I am sorry".
"No, it was me.
I'm sorry.
I overreacted".
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter But we had our best friend's interest at heart".
"Could I be more sorry"?
"l don't know.
I am one sorry polontologist".
All right, Joey, we get it.
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry too.
Keep reading.
The good part's coming up.
"l am sorry, Chandler".
"l am sorry, Ross".
"A handsome man enters".
"l don't know what you're talking about, but I'd like to thank you both.
You.
You wouldn't let me give up on myself.
And you.
You co-created Fireball".
"The End".
This took you all day?
No, this took five minutes.
I spent the rest of the day coming up with new Ultimate Fireball!
It's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out.
Go.
-"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly"?
-"I'm doing just fine.
God, Tiffany, you smell so great".
"It's my new perfume.
Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it"?
-Joey, you are sick.
-This is disgusting.
I'm not reading this.
Wait, wait, wait!
The handsome man was about to enter!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Any entertainment there?
All right.
Here we go!
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else will, so.
All right, I'll take care of it.
It's 30 seconds to midnight, what are you gonna do?
Will you just trust me?
Thirty-three, 32, 31 Who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?
You can't kiss your sister.
-Who's gonna kiss my sister?
-Chandler.
Oh, man!
Really?
Would you rather have me or him kiss her?
That's a good point.
Since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Phoebe!
Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.
So obvious.
Why doesn't he just ask?
-Rach!
I'm gonna kiss you at midnight.
-What?
You can't kiss Ross.
You got the history.
So?
-Would you prefer me or Chandler?
-Good point.
Three, two, one!
Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.
-Happy New Year.
-You too.
Happy New Year, Joey.
So that do anything for you?
The One with All the Resolutions You know what?
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say "No divorces in '99"!
But your divorce isn't final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99!
I am gonna be happy this year.
I am gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room?
Every day I am gonna do one thing I have never done before.
That is my New Year's resolution.
That's a good one!
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Now you only have to find a planeload of people whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.
Especially the ones who might fly you to Europe for free.
She has a better chance of flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
I'll bet $50 you can't go the year without making fun of us.
Better yet, a week.
I'll take that bet, my friend.
Paying me the $50 can be the "new thing you do" that day.
And it starts right now!
My New Year's resolution is to learn how to play guitar.
Really?
How come?
You know those special skills I have listed on my resume?
I would love it if one of those was true.
Want me to teach you?
I'm great.
Really?
Who have you taught?
Well, I taught me.
And I loved me.
That'd be great!
Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.
My resolution is to be less obsessed with being neat and clean.
Really?
Or something else.
Look.
Blaire forgot her glasses.
She'll need these to keep an eye on that boyfriend.
Who, from what I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I mean!
Maybe your resolution should be to gossip less.
What?
I don't gossip.
Maybe sometimes I find out things.
Or I hear something and I pass that information on.
You know, kind of like a public service.
It doesn't mean I'm a gossip.
Is Ted Koppel a gossip?
If Ted Koppel talked about his coworkers' botched boob jobs, I would.
They were like this!
Fine, my New Year's resolution will be not to gossip.
-It's easy.
-Easy?
You have never kept a resolution.
-Yes, I have.
-Okay, let's see how you did last year.
No.
No.
Not my diary.
You cannot read my diary.
"Dear diary: I'm so excited.
My resolution is to write in you every day.
See you tomorrow".
Nothing.
You know, not a lot happened last year.
All right, I will prove to you that I can keep it this time.
No more gossiping.
I hate gossip.
In junior high this girl said a lot of mean stuff about me and I set her bike on fire.
-Wow, what did she say about you?
-She said I was crazy.
But I guess she got hers.
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Okay.
I just asked that girl out.
Nice!
Is that part of your "new thing" for today?
Yes, it is.
See?
"Elizabeth Hornswoggle"?
That's right.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
You okay, Chandler?
Something funny about that name?
No, I just think I've heard it somewhere before.
Oh, really?
Where?
Somewhere funny, I'll bet.
Guess what.
I have a date with Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Oh, this must be killing you!
All right, see you later.
Not really.
-I haven't told you her middle name yet.
-Well, don't.
Just don't.
-See you later.
-See you.
All right, Phoebe, I am ready for my first lesson.
No, you don't touch the guitar.
First you learn here, then here.
Lesson one: Chords.
Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords.
But I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.
So then this is "Bear Claw".
"Turkey Leg" and "Old Lady".
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.
Hey, everybody!
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't.
Even when I found out Let's say I found out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Check this out.
You nailed the Old Lady!
I thought I was getting better, so I stopped by this guitar store Did you touch any of the guitars there?
Did you?
No.
Give me your hands.
Strings.
Pick.
-Do you want to learn to play guitar?
-Yes.
Then don't touch one!
-Hi, Ben.
-Auntie Monica!
Ross is wearing leather pants!
Does nobody else see Ross is wearing leather pants?
Someone comment on the pants!
-I think they're very nice.
-I really like them a lot.
Not what I had in mind.
People like Ross don't wear these types of pants.
You see, they're very tight.
Maybe there's something in that area?
I think they look really good.
Where'd you get them?
I needed a new thing for today.
There's this leather store that always smells so good.
And I thought to myself: "Wow.
I've never owned a really good-smelling pair of pants before".
Oh, come on!
What do you think?
You look like a freak.
Awful!
What are you doing?
-It's my New Year's resolution.
-To blind my child?
To take pictures of us together.
It's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.
Everyone will enjoy my music as well.
My God, these pants!
I'm burning up.
Oh God!
She wants to snuggle now?
Is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here!
-Are you hot?
-No.
It must just be me, then.
That was just the pants and the couch.
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
-Go ahead.
-Thanks.
My favorite part's coming up!
Oh, my God!
Tiger.
Dragon.
Iceberg!
Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Yes, I did!
Then do lceberg.
G-sharp.
G-sharp?
Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
Have you?
Oh, my God!
What?
I didn't touch a guitar!
But you're questioning my method!
No, I'm not questioning it.
I'm saying it's stupid!
What?
Thank you.
You know, none of my other student thought I was stupid.
Your other student was you!
Well, maybe you just need to try a little harder!
Maybe I need to try a real teacher!
Here!
Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.
There's a picture of him with a kid.
And the kid's got a guitar!
Fine!
You learn from your "qualified instructor".
But don't come crying when everyone is sick of hearing you play "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown"!
Oh, fine.
Take his side!
I can't wait to be with you.
I'll sneak over as soon as I can.
I'll tell Rachel I'll be doing laundry.
Laundry.
Is that my new nickname?
You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big Would you stop looking at me like that?
Phoebe was a terrible teacher.
I wasn't learning anything from her Look I feel bad, too Forget it, we're going around in circles.
Joey, it's Ross.
I need some help.
Chandler's not here.
You can help me.
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
Nice!
No, I got really hot in my pants, so I took them off.
But they must have shrunk from the sweat.
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
I can't get them back on, Joey.
I can't!
That is quite a situation.
Do you see any powder?
Powder!
Yeah, I have powder.
Good, good.
Sprinkle some on.
It'll absorb moisture.
Then you can get your pants on.
Yeah, hold on.
They're not coming on, man.
Okay, cut slits in the pants, right?
Then put them back on go out there and tell her you're the lncredible Hulk.
Chandler's not there?
That would have worked, but all right, fine.
You see any.
Oh, Vaseline?
I see lotion.
I have lotion.
Will that work?
Sure, throw some of that on there.
Hold on.
Sounds like it's working.
They're still not coming on, man.
And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.
Really.
What color is it?
What difference does that make?
If the paste matches the pants, you can make paste pants and she won't know!
Do you have a minute?
Dude, what am l Rachel's here, so good luck.
Let me know how it goes.
Joey, I have such a problem.
Your timing couldn't be better.
I'm putting out fires all over the place.
I have got to tell you something.
What is it?
It's so huge!
But promise me.
You cannot tell anyone.
No, no, no!
I don't want to know.
You do want to know.
This is unbelievable!
I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets and can't tell anyone.
You know secrets?
You're not supposed to gossip!
I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone I'm not listening to you!
You've been in there for a long time.
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out.
Hey, can you turn the lights off?
Let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, my God!
I had a problem.
I can't talk to you.
I don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages.
I want to apologize for saying your method was stupid.
And maybe ask you to be my teacher again?
I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
You really think I'm ready?
Wow, cool!
-Was the chord at least right before -No.
Oh, my God!
We heard about your pants.
I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great.
It's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
You're not a loser.
Look at me!
Hey, look!
Ben drew a picture of you.
You're a cowboy.
Because of the leather pants?
He thinks you're a cowboy, not a loser.
That's something.
-lt really is something.
-Howdy, partner.
Maybe I should get another pair.
You know, they had some with fringe all down the sides.
Phoebe, you may know this.
You know strange things.
What is the boiling point of brain?
I used to know this.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Now that everything's wrapped up, I'll do my laundry.
Yeah, me too.
If this shirt is dirty.
I'm going to the airport.
If I hang around there long enough someone's bound to leave a plane unattended.
-Good luck, honey.
-Bye.
Remember that thing I was gonna tell you about?
I won't tell you.
But if you found out on your own that would be okay and we could talk about it.
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So that would be okay.
Would you mind going into Chandler's bedroom and getting that book he borrowed from me?
Now?
You want me to go over there now?
-Do you know something?
-Do you?
-I might know something.
-I might too.
-What do you know?
-You tell me first.
-I can't.
-Then I can't.
Okay, fine.
You don't know.
I'll walk into his bedroom and see the thing I think I know is actually the thing I think I know!
-You know!
-And you know!
Yeah, I know!
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable!
-How long have you known?
-Too long!
I've been dying to talk to someone about this!
You can't say anything to anybody.
They're so weird about that.
It's raining.
I don't like to fly in the rain.
I am gonna go for a walk in the rain.
Me too.
That's weird.
I bet they're doing it.
Okay, look.
I can't take it anymore.
So you win.
Okay?
Here.
Flying a jet?
Make it a spaceship so you can get back to your home planet!
Phone call for you.
Tom Jones.
He wants his pants back!
And Hornswoggle?
What, are you dating a character from Fraggle Rock?
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Come on, Joey!
I told you everything I knew last night.
It's not that big a deal.
So they're doing it.
I cannot believe you would say that!
Sorry.
Monica and Chandler are "making love".
No, I mean, come on.
This is a huge deal!
I need more details.
Who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
God, I just can't imagine Chandler being romantic.
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
Are they in love?
I don't know.
You don't know anything.
I know one thing.
They did it right there.
The One With Chandler's Work Laugh Could I have a scone?
-Want to hear some good news?
-ls somebody else gonna give it to us?
Because you certainly don't seem like you have any.
No, I do.
Someone I know is getting married.
Weddings are happy occasions.
Oh, it's my ex-wife, Emily!
Sorry, man.
-Here's your scone.
-Thanks.
Stupid British snack food!
Did they teach you that in anger management?
You know what might help you deal with it?
You two are in the past.
You can't be mad about the past.
Are you still mad about, you know, the Louisiana Purchase?
Nobody's mad about that.
Exactly!
Because it's in the past.
Anybody going to eat that?
Look at us all dressed up for the party.
What are we celebrating?
We had a lot of liquor left over from Christmas.
Our friends aren't here.
We can be a real couple.
We don't have to hide.
I know.
I can do this.
And I can do this.
We can't do that.
Hey, Bing!
Who's the pretty lady, and what is she doing with you?
I asked myself that very question, sir.
My boss, Doug.
-This is Monica.
-Hi.
-This is my wife, Kara.
-Nice to meet you.
Did you hear about the new law firm working for us?
Dickem, Stickem & Run.
Let's go drink our body weight.
What was that?
That noise you made?
Oh, my work laugh.
Your work laugh?
If you're going to survive this party, come up with one too.
All right.
Check me out.
He says, "$30, Father.
Same as in town".
Everybody at work loved you last night.
And they like me more just because I was with you.
You repaired the damage from when they met Joey.
Doug wants to play tennis.
He never talks to me outside of work.
Except for that time at that strip club.
Strip church.
-I'll go find a racket.
-I thought you had one.
I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun to go hit rocks at bigger rocks.
Do you have a tennis racket?
I lent it to Joey, and I've never gotten it back.
Good luck with that.
What's up?
Why are you here?
I thought you had inventory.
I do, but I decided I'd take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica.
You know, I feel like we don't talk anymore.
How are you?
What is new with you?
Not much.
Work's good.
We don't have to talk about work.
Talk about anything.
You know what?
Let's talk about relationships.
What's going on?
Nothing.
You go.
There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute.
But I don't anymore.
That's juicy.
You know what?
I actually do have a lot of work to do.
You're sure there's just not anything else?
I'm sure.
Is there something you want to talk to me about?
No!
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.
Then what happened?
You'll get your turn.
-Hey, Phoebe.
What's going on?
-Nothing.
This is not over.
No, no, no!
I was up all night writing this nasty letter to Emily.
It was perfect, and now it's all covered in.
Actually, thanks!
All right!
Ready to go to the movies?
Actually, I think I'll skip it.
Really?
I'll read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.
Sure you don't want to?
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan.
They get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe.
Let's go, Phoebe.
Game!
I got to tell you, that partner of yours is a real tiger.
Are you all right?
We'll just get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?
Those birds are browned, basted and ready to be carved.
Okay, easy, Martina.
I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
Are you crazy?
We own those two.
Look at them!
He can't even breathe, and she's popping pills.
You're not giving them a chance.
They have rackets.
We'll make this the last game.
Yes, sir.
Put me out of my misery.
Are you sure you never played pro?
Please let them win.
I'll take it down to 95%, but that's the best I can do.
-Missed it!
-I got it!
Nice shot.
I got it!
Long!
I can't believe you let them win.
Well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.
It's my racket.
Frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.
What bothers me is how different you act around them.
The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh the "See you later, Bing"!
"Not if I see you first, Doug"!
Listen, I don't sound like some crazed, drunken pirate.
I know you don't, but "work Chandler" does.
I don't like work Chandler.
The guy's a suck-up.
Because you said that I'm not putting out tonight!
Something's wrong.
My brother doesn't stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right.
He almost could.
Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Oh, my God!
Where the hell have you been?
Just, you know, out.
Oh, out!
God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.
What were you doing?
I went to a bar, and then I just walked around for a while.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up!
He hooked up.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I'm a big boy.
I can do what I want.
He hooked up!
Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf Hey, you guys.
I know what you all are thinking, but Chandler is in Yemen.
I'm a young woman.
I have needs.
I can't wait forever.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you, please, just take a moment before you judge me.
Nobody's judging you.
Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time call me.
So I guess you finished your book.
Had some time on our hands, did we?
I know what you guys are going to say.
You two would have very hairy children.
I didn't know you'd say that.
Ross!
Janice?
All right.
Hold on, hold on.
This is Ross.
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.
He obviously lost his mind.
Look, it's not that crazy.
Okay?
But it's Janice!
I mean, she's Janice!
How drunk were you?
Janice and I have a lot in common.
We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.
Are you going to see her again?
-Don't put ideas in his head!
-I will see her.
Damn it, Phoebe!
I have to tell you something that I've never admitted.
In high school, I made out with James even though I knew you liked him.
That feels so good to get off my chest.
Okay, you go.
My turn?
What are you talking about?
I know about you and Chandler.
I overheard you on the phone the other day.
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours".
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname"?
And you said: "You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big".
You're writing yourself a little play there, Rach.
Let me know how it turns out.
I wouldn't know, because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone.
Well, if you had kept listening you would have heard me call him Mister Bigot.
Mr. Bigot.
He tells the most racist jokes.
All right.
So that's it.
There's nothing going on between you and Chandler?
Me and Chandler?
Put your $20 down.
First one to find the tasty treat wins, okay?
All right, let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
And they're off!
Get your foot off my contestant!
Judge?
Judge rules, no violation.
It's so weird to say this, but I just had a great date with Janice.
-What?
-Are you serious?
I opened up to her about all the stuff that's been happening to me.
I mean, I talked for hours.
It is amazing to have someone give you such focused attention.
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!
Judge rules Nutter Butter.
Tough call.
Seriously, I strongly believe that we should support President Clinton and her husband, Bill.
How do you like your coffee?
-None for me.
-A little sugar.
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
That will sweeten it up.
-That laugh doesn't give you a headache?
-You get used to it.
I don't think that I can.
This will be it for me on the work things.
I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?
I'd rather not be with this work-weasel guy when I can be with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.
I got to apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it in a fight.
It's not strong enough to defend itself.
Hear what I said?
What?
It's a joke.
What's the matter with you?
Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.
Excuse me?
-Well, I just -Honey?
I just don't think you understood the joke.
Really?
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.
You see, Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.
But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physically.
-You get it now, honey?
-I think I do!
-Thank you, Monica.
-I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
You mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure.
Why?
Chandler and Monica are over there.
It's kind of hard to concentrate.
She just called and said she was going to be working late.
She keeps lying to me.
That's it!
I'm going over there and confronting them right now.
Panty raid.
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?
I'm just not very good at this.
I'm a terrible liar.
I hate having to lie to Rachel.
-But we're not ready to tell yet.
-I know.
Ever since high school, Rachel was the one person that I told everything to.
I miss that so much now.
She's my best friend.
Oh, my God, Rachel!
What are you doing here?
Well, I actually came over here to borrow this lamp to look at my books.
You know, see them a little better.
Okay, great.
Well, what I was doing in Chandler's room is that I was cleaning it.
He pays me to clean it.
What a great way to make some extra pocket money.
When I said to you earlier that I was at work I'm at my new work.
Good enough.
Right?
I'll go look at my books.
Go get back to my new job.
Congratulations on your new job!
Man, she is really gullible.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
-Actually, I should get going.
-You're sure?
I can stay out as late as you want.
I told you I'm on sabbatical from work Yes, yes.
You did.
-Oh, man!
-What is wrong now?
This isn't what I ordered.
Man!
Can't anything go right in my life?
First, my marriage falls apart, and then I know!
You lose your apartment, you lose your job your ex-wife gets married so fast!
And now the coffee!
We need to talk.
-Sometimes I feel -No, no, don't.
I'm going to talk.
I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
You're a very sweet person, Ross.
Unfortunately I just don't think I can take another second of you whining!
Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.
You're ending this with me because I'm too whiny?
So you're saying I've become so whiny that l annoy you Janice.
Well, yeah!
Oh, my God!
Will you be okay?
I am now.
I guess that's two out of three Joey!
Dude, we got to talk.
I wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else.
I hope this isn't too weird, but I had a thing with Janice.
You're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
Because there's certain rules about this kind of stuff.
You don't fool around with your friends' ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I am mad.
But you know, I'm going to forgive you.
Because that's what friends do.
They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said.
Thank you.
But I want you to remember that I forgave you.
I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent-free.
All right.
And I want you to remember that I gave you twenty-seven dollars.
No strings attached!
If you can't remember that we should write it down.
Let's write it down!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
I can't believe we've never done this.
It's so good!
It's so good for Monica.
Time's up!
My turn.
-That was half an hour?
-It's your timer.
I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
I don't know what I did to deserve it.
Now stop trying to add more time to your massage.
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye, muscles!
The One with Joey's Bag She gives the worst massages ever!
It was like she was torturing me for information.
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.
For the first time, I'm in a real relationship.
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
Dude, look out!
You almost crushed my hat.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
This is called a top hat.
And why are you wearing this?
Is it "top hat"?
There's this play and I'm up for the part of this cool, suave, international guy.
A clotheshorse.
So I figure everyone at the audition will wear ultra-hip, high-fashion stuff.
And you'll make them disappear?
Like you could find something this sophisticated.
Done!
If you want to look good, come to the store.
I'll help you.
-Thanks!
-Sure.
Please, take those off!
Hey, Phoebe.
How's it going?
Only okay because I just got back from the hospital.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, but my grandma sort of died.
Phoebe, sorry.
It's okay.
She had a really incredible life.
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.
Maybe she's with us right now.
Right.
She's on a new spiritual plain and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!
Phoebe' grandmother just died.
Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry.
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like you know, one life ends and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it.
What happened?
How did she die?
We were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and never came back up again.
I'm so sorry.
The last thing she said was: "You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt, and we'll meet at the checkout counter".
You know what?
We will meet at the checkout counter.
Since you're returning all this stuff you'll have to wear underwear.
All right.
You'd better show me that too.
It's missing something.
Really?
A purse?
It's not a purse.
It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse.
Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
See, look.
Men carrying the bag.
See, look.
Women carrying the bag.
But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
Exactly.
Unisex!
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.
No, Joey.
U-N-I sex.
I ain't gonna say no to that!
-Who is it?
-It's Phoebe.
Oh, great!
Oh, you.
What's up?
Well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?
No, thanks.
Grandma died today.
Didn't she die like five years ago?
No, she just died today.
We're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know I went to that already.
No, you didn't!
Then who's been dead?
Lots of people!
Look, are you coming or not?
I thought she was dead, so I've made my peace.
Plus I'm going to a concert.
I'd invite you, but I only have two tickets left.
-Fine.
Okay, enjoy your concert.
-Thanks.
Enjoy your funeral!
You look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani.
What?
Are you referring to my man's bag?
I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too.
It's got compartments for your wallet, keys, address book.
Your makeup.
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
You get mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!
-All right, then you owe me $350.
-Fine.
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?
Relax, I'll pay you with the money from the job I'll get.
Thanks to you.
What's the part?
Auntie Mame?
Don't listen to them.
I think it's sexy.
You-and-I sexy?
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.
Here's your 3-D glasses.
Reverend Pong will say when to put them on.
Hi, sweetie.
-How are you holding up?
-Fine.
Hey, Phoebe.
I'm so sorry.
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!
I brought you flowers.
Oh, thanks!
Pulling flowers out makes the bag look masculine.
Excuse me, is this the memorial?
Welcome.
Here's your 3-D glasses.
All right.
So how did you know Frances?
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
But I was pretty tight with her and her daughter.
What's your name?
Frank Buffay.
You know what?
Strike that.
My name, actually, is Joe.
Joe Hill.
You're Frank Buf No!
Joe Hill.
You just said I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.
Oh, my God!
What happened?
That was my dad.
Check it out!
It's like it's coming right at me.
-Did you catch him?
-What did he say?
He said, "Nice to meet you, Glenda".
I couldn't give him my real name.
Why not?
You saw the way he ran.
You think he'd talk to the daughter he abandoned?
What did you say to him?
I said I was the executor of the will and I needed to talk to him.
I'm going to meet him at the coffeehouse.
Could everyone take their seats?
I just can't think about that now.
I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
Let's go say goodbye.
I'm off to my audition.
How do I look?
Great!
That bag will get you that part.
And a date with a man.
You know what?
Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.
And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
You guys have to get used to the fact that Joey comes with a bag!
I've got to meet my dad.
Will you tell him who you are?
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.
But aren't you pissed at him?
This guy abandoned you.
If it were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger.
I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!
You and me, outside.
Right now"!
I kind of scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
You'd think I'd be angry.
You'd think I'd want to rip his tiny, little head off!
Fortunately, I'm past it.
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.
Get off!
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
I give good massages.
I gave them to Rachel before she got allergic.
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.
He does not like it.
He's in pain!
-No, he's not.
-Yes, he is!
-What?
-I'm sorry, but You've been lying to me?
I can't believe that.
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.
But the minute we start to lie to each other.
And by "we" I mean society.
Anytime you're ready.
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.
Could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure.
Well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit Can I ask you something?
Sure.
What?
Well, first, it's not a purse.
Anytime.
If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.
It's a man's bag.
Okay.
And go!
Let me show you the catalog.
Look.
See?
It's the latest thing.
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.
Do you sell these?
No, these babies sell themselves.
Thank you.
That was great.
But I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough.
All right, I'll see you.
We got it.
We got it.
Is Rachel here?
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about the whole massage thing.
I really like them.
Please, stop!
We're supposed to be honest.
I wish you could tell me, "l don't like your massages".
I don't like your massages.
See?
It's no big deal.
But now you're crying!
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
You don't have to be best at everything.
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!
You give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!
Look, hear me out.
You give the best bad-massages.
If anybody was looking for the best bad-massage and they thought, "Who's the best"?
They'd have to go to you.
So you're saying that if there was an award for the best bad-massage.
Who would get that?
It would be you!
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.
So they could call the award, "The Monica"?
Absolutely.
I suck!
Thank you for meeting me.
Thank you.
Come sit.
Sit.
Sit!
Alrighty.
Before we get started, I need you to state for the record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
Yes, I am.
What did Frances leave me?
That's why you wanted me to come.
Yes, she did.
She left you this lipstick.
It's used.
Cool!
I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.
So question one: You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly.
Correct?
Yes, I was.
Question two.
Did that marriage end:  Happily?
Medium?
Or  In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
It really says that?
Yeah, see?
I guess then I would have to say C. Total abandonment.
Reasons for abandonment:  Top-secret government work.
Amnesia.
Or  You're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man.
I don't want the lipstick that much.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you give Lilly that, please?
When you see Lilly, give her that note.
I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but I pictured her getting mad the way you did, and I chickened out.
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?
But you came to see Lilly?
Yeah.
Why?
Lilly's dead.
She what?
She's dead.
Are you sure?
If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe How?
Oh, my God.
How long ago?
What about the girls?
Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.
And Phoebe is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you!
Phoebe, l. It's just, I don't know what to say.
I just can't believe that you're my daughter.
You're so pretty.
Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
Would it make you feel better if I said that I was very, very sorry I left?
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.
So you can just go.
Well, you know, in my defense, I was a lousy father.
-That's your defense?
-Yes, it is.
I burned the formula, and I put your diapers on backwards.
I made up a song to sing to you, but that made you cry even more.
You make up songs?
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.
Let's see, how did it go?
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl Why won't you go to sleep?
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl You're keeping me up I'm not very good at this.
Well, I am.
Not yet.
No.
How'd the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What?
Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.
I thought so too but the casting people had problems with me.
What kind of problem?
To tell you the truth they had a problem with the bag!
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.
It's time to give up the bag.
I don't want to give up the bag.
I don't have to give it up.
Do l, Rach?
You think I should give up the bag!
Joey, I'm sorry.
As terrific as I think you are with it I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe this!
Wait, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a bag.
There are other bags that are maybe a little less controversial.
Yeah, they're called wallets.
You're right.
You're right.
This bag has become like a part of me.
It's likemy bag.
It had a place for everything.
-Oh, man.
-What?
There's a whole series of pockets here I didn't even know about, Rach.
Look.
Ursula, I have the most amazing news.
I found our dad.
Phoebe.
Your sister.
And I found our dad.
John Glenn?
John Glenn is not our dad.
No, I will not join you in the lawsuit against him.
It doesn't matter that he wasn't there while we were growing up.
He's not our father.
What do you mean that's for a jury to decide?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Guys, look!
Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.
I'd say our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled "Clothes".
I'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
If he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place!
It would be so cool to live across from you guys.
We could do that telephone thing where you have a can, we have a can and it's connected by a string.
Or we could do the actual telephone thing.
He's got packing tape stuck to where you really don't want it.
Get it off, fat man!
Get it off!
Oh, no, he's trying to pull it off slowly.
Take it from me, if you're gonna pull tape off yourself, it's gotta be in one quick motion.
Like that.
The One Where Everyone Finds Out Oh, my God.
I love this apartment!
Isn't it perfect?
I can't believe I never realized how great it is!
Because your eye goes to the big naked man.
It's amazing!
Hurry up with an application, or I'll beat you to it.
Well, I'm going to use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Look!
There's Monica and Chandler.
Hey, you guys!
Chandler and Monica!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my eyes!
My eyes!
It's okay!
-They're doing it!
-I know!
-I know!
-You know?
Yes, I know it.
Joey knows, but Ross doesn't, so stop screaming!
What's going on?
-What?
-Nothing!
We are so excited that you'll get this apartment!
Looks really good.
Looks pretty good!
Get in here!
Come on!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler were doing laundry or going grocery shopping?
The time Monica spent on the phone with Linda from camp?
Doing it, doing it, phone, doing it.
I can't believe it!
I think it's great.
For him.
She could do better.
Hey, you guys.
Come here!
Phoebe found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
Joey, she knows.
We saw them doing it through the window.
Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
We saw them fornicating.
So they know you know, and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but it doesn't matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know.
All the lying and the secrets will finally be over.
Or, we could not tell them we know, and have a little fun.
What do you mean?
If they say they are doing laundry, we'll give them laundry to do.
I would enjoy that.
You know what would be even more fun?
Telling them.
-That doesn't sound like fun.
-So we'll make it fun.
We'll do it like a barbershop quartet!
We know, we know, we know No, I want to do Phoebe's thing.
I can't take You don't have to do anything.
Just don't tell them we know.
I can't take anymore secrets.
I got your secrets, their secrets, secrets of my own.
You don't have any secrets.
Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
How are we going to mess with them?
You could use your position as the roommate.
And I would use the strongest tool at my disposal.
My sexuality.
Hello, children.
Watch.
Learn.
And don't eat my cookie.
That jacket looks great on you.
-Really?
-The material is so soft.
Hello, Mr. Bicep.
You're working out?
I try to squeeze things.
Are you okay?
If you really want to know I can't tell you this.
You can tell me anything.
Actually, you are the one person I can't tell this to.
And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I just haven't been with a guy in so long and sometimes you're looking for something and it's right there in front of you, sipping coffee.
Oh, no.
Have I said too much?
Just something to think about.
I know I will.
You are so cute.
How did you get to be so cute?
My grandfather was Swedish.
And my grandmother was a tiny little bunny.
Now you're even cuter.
You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
It's not possible.
I'm sorry, Phoebe's just always thought you were charming in a sexless kind of way.
You know, I can't hear that enough.
I just think you misunderstood her.
I didn't, okay?
She was all over me.
She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
This bicep?
Well, it's not flexed right now.
Why is it so hard for you to believe that Phoebe could be attracted to me?
It's not.
All the girls are attracted to you.
You're part bunny.
Mon, you want to come see a movie with us?
Actually, I was going to do some laundry.
Want to do it with me?
Sure, I'll do it with you.
Okay, great.
Hold on a second.
Here you go.
That would really help me out a lot.
Thanks.
You know what?
I don't have enough quarters.
I have quarters!
Great.
Now we can do laundry all night.
All night laundry!
Hey, any word on the apartment yet?
I called there, and it turns out Naked Guy is subletting it.
He's already had 100 applicants.
-Oh, man.
-No, no, it's okay.
Because you know what the difference between them and me is?
Your history of bedwetting?
Hey, I trusted you, man!
Anyway, the difference is I've got the edge.
It's not exactly ethical, but I sent him a bribe to tip the scales in my direction.
You can see it from the window.
Is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
That new mountain bike?
What did you send?
A basket of mini muffins.
There's a whole table of them.
Which one did you send?
The small one.
You actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment?
Someone sent us a basket at work, and people went crazy over those muffins.
It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh, man, I want that place so much!
And I was so sure that was going to work.
There's 12 bucks I'll never see again.
We'd better go if we want to catch that movie.
Bye.
Bye, Chandler.
I miss you already.
Did you see that?
The inappropriate, and the pinching?
Actually, I did.
So do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Oh, my God!
She knows about us!
Are you serious?
She knows, and she's trying to freak us out!
That's the only explanation!
But what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?
She knows!
Phoebe knows about us.
I didn't tell them!
Them?
Who's "them"?
Phoebe and Joey.
And Rachel.
I would have told you, but I promised not to tell.
I'm sorry.
But it's over now, right?
You can tell them you know they know, and I can go back to knowing nothing!
Unless Not "unless"!
This must end now!
They think they are so slick messing with us.
But they don't know that we know that they know.
So The messers become the messees!
Come on, you guys.
Think how much fun it would be to tell.
We know, we know, we know What?
Oh, that wasn't you.
Honey, you got to stop torturing yourself.
Why don't you find another apartment?
I've already looked at 1000 apartments this month.
None of them even compares to that one.
Well, except for one, but I would have had to share it with an Armenian family.
Grandma really liked me.
But I want Ugly Naked apartment!
You know what?
You should find out his hobbies and use that to bond with him.
Like if I wanted something from Joey I would strike up a conversation about sandwiches or my underwear.
I'm listening.
That is a great idea!
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for five years.
So that gives me back my edge!
Let's see now.
He had the trampoline.
He broke that.
-He had gravity boots.
-He broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
I've got to go pick up Ben.
But I will figure something out.
Didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would bum him out.
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.
Hold on a second, she's right here.
It's Chandler.
Hello, you.
Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
You know that thing you said before?
I was intrigued.
Really?
Joey won't be here tonight.
Why don't you come over?
I'll let you feel my bicep.
Or maybe more.
I'll have to get back to you on that.
He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Are you kidding?
I cannot believe he would do that to Mon Joey?
Do they know that we know?
They know you know.
I knew it!
I would say, "Thank God!
Everybody knows!
It's finally over"!
But that hasn't been working for me.
I cannot believe those two!
They thought they could mess with us?
Trying to mess with us?
They don't know that we know they know we know.
Joey, you can't say anything.
Couldn't if I wanted to.
Good evening, sir.
I'm Ross Geller.
I'm one of the applicants.
I realize that the competition is fierce but.
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice that you're naked.
I applaud you.
Man, I wish I was naked.
I mean, this looks so great.
That is how God intended it.
Look.
They're panicked!
They'll totally back down.
If he wants a date, he's going to get a date.
I'm going to go in.
Be sexy.
Please.
I'd love to come by tonight.
Really?
Absolutely.
Say, around 7?
I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hey, check it out!
Naked Guy's got a naked friend.
Oh, my God!
That's our friend!
It's Naked Ross!
Would you like another mini muffin?
Try the blueberry, they're delicious.
Showtime!
Rachel, get me perfume.
Joey, can you get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, thanks, but glasses that do not have handles and that are glass.
And wine that is not olive oil.
Make her think you want to have sex with her and it will freak her out.
How far am I gonna have to go with her?
She'll give in way before you do.
How do you know?
Because you're on my team.
My team always wins.
At this?
Just go get some!
Go!
Now, I'm going to try to listen from right here.
Oh, wait.
Good idea.
Don't give away the farm.
Come on in.
I was going to.
I brought some wine.
Would you like some?
Sure.
So here we are.
Nervous?
Me?
No.
You?
I want this to happen.
So do l. I'm going to put on some music.
Joey likes to scare the duck.
Maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Thanks.
You know, when you say things like that, it makes me want to rip that sweater vest right off.
Why don't we move into the bedroom?
Really?
Do you not want to?
First I want to take off all my clothes and have you rub lotion on me.
That would be nice.
I'll go get the lotion.
It's way out of hand.
She wants me to put lotion on her!
-She's bluffing!
-She's not backing down.
She went like this He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.
It's Chandler.
You can take him.
Come on.
Don't you remember when you made him cry using only your words?
Aren't you guys done yet?
I want to sit in my chair!
The sooner Phoebe breaks him, the sooner it's over and out in the open.
I like that.
Show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras.
Can't work them.
You didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
Go back there and seduce her till she cracks!
Give me a second.
-Did you clean up in here?
-Of course!
You're going?
Not without you, lover.
So this is my bra.
It's very, very nice.
Well, come here.
I'm very happy we're going to have all the sex.
You should be.
I'm very bendy.
I'll kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.
I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
You win!
I can't have sex with you!
-And why not?
-I'm in love with Monica!
You're what?
Love her!
I love her!
I love her!
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I thought you were doing it.
I didn't know you were in love!
Dude!
Hats off to Phoebe.
Quite a competitor.
May I say your breasts are still showing.
God.
All right!
So that's it?
It's over.
Everybody knows!
Actually, Ross doesn't.
We'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
Well, here it is.
A new place for a new Ross.
I'll have you and the guys from work over, once it's furnished.
It's nice to see you back on your feet.
I am that, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our museum team?
That would be great.
I am totally ready to come back to work.
What are you doing?
Get off my sister!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Chandler!
Chandler!
I saw what you were doing in the window!
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!
Listen, we had a good run.
What was it?
Four, five months?
That's more than most people have in a lifetime.
Goodbye.
-What are you doing?
-I am going on the lam.
Come on, Chandler.
I can handle Ross.
Hold on!
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude, he's right there.
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
We're not just messing around.
I love her.
I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
You guys want to probably get some hugs in too.
Big news!
We've actually known for a while.
What?
You guys knew?
You all knew and you didn't tell me?
We were worried about you.
We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me?
You didn't know how I'd react?
Okay.
All right.
Let's clear out of here and let these lovebirds get back to business.
I'm just talking here.
He's the one doing your sister.
The One With the Girl Who Hits Joey You know what I just realized?
If you guys have kids We're having kids?
I call godfather!
You can't just call godfather.
Shouldn't her brother be godfather?
Sure.
If you cared enough to call it first.
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.
I just thought of the greatest wedding gift.
I'll go in on that with you.
I couldn't decide.
Hey, Katie.
This is Katie.
You ready to go?
I'll run to the bathroom.
Where's lunch?
I was thinking Chinese food.
I love Chinese!
How did you know I love Chinese?
She is so cute.
You could fit her in your pocket.
She could fit in that little pocket inside the pocket.
I don't know.
I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but.
But what?
She keeps punching me.
In the cute, little sweet way she just did?
It's a lot harder than it looks.
She's hurting me.
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.
What is Ben doing after preschool?
Joey is having a problem.
A little girl is beating him up.
Joey, come here.
Honey, I know.
This must be really difficult for you, and I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
I brought you some housewarming gifts.
Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Bread, so you never go hungry.
And a scented candle for the bathroom.
Because, well, you know.
Thanks.
Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.
Welcome.
I'm Steve Cera, president of the tenants' committee.
Ross Geller.
And this is my friend Phoebe.
Mr. President.
I came to talk to you about Howard.
He is the handyman who's retiring next week.
Everyone who lives here is kicking in $100 as a kind of a thank you.
That's nice.
Want to give me a check?
Not now.
You can slip it under my door.
No, it's not that.
I just moved in.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Okay, I get it.
Wait!
Look, I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard.
I mean, I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handyman.
Yes, but to me, he's just "man".
Okay.
Fine.
Whatever.
Welcome to the building.
Can you believe that guy?
I really like his glasses.
So then President Steve told everyone I was a cheapskate and now the whole building hates me.
A little kid spit on my knee.
And told me to wipe it off with my $100 bill.
You really should wipe it off with something.
You know what?
I'll throw a party.
For everyone in the building.
And I'll sit them all down and explain that I am not a bad guy.
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy who stands up for what he believes in.
A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party.
If you want them to like you, why don't you just pay the $100?
The party will cost you more.
That doesn't matter!
It's my principles!
We're talking about my principles!
I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
They'll like me once they come to my awesome party.
I gotta get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.
Don't put any ideas in her head.
You do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head?
Why?
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so?
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't freak out!
I'm telling you something you already know.
She left Richard because he didn't want to have babies.
And she is a woman.
And she's almost 30.
And, you know, it's Monica.
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas.
My friend who lives across the hall and wants a lot of babies.
And the new Monica who I started to date.
Now, who is to say what she wants?
I'm right.
Am I right?
Oh, absolutely.
I'm completely different from Richard.
He's an eye doctor, and I don't wear glasses.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
That makes everything different.
It's not different, is it?
Not unless different means "the same".
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!
You know, bread-stick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to talk, okay?
Look, I like you.
I really do.
I like you a lot.
But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that it feels like I'm being hit with a very tiny but a very real bat!
Like I could hurt you.
Are you making fun of my size?
Don't make fun of me because of my size!
Isn't this great?
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else.
You know, wherever.
Are you okay?
I'm cool.
Casual.
What are you doing?
Just hanging out.
Having fun with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.
What?
Get all freaked out because everybody was joking about marriage!
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
You know what I want?
Yes!
You want babies!
You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!
You're obsessed with babies and marriage and everything that's related to babies and marriage.
Why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker!
Have you lost your mind?
This isn't about me.
This is about you and your weird commitment crap!
I know you.
I know the thoughts that you have in your head.
You don't know everything.
Did you know I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you?
And that the only baby here is you?
Did you know I can't even look at you now?
I did not know that.
It'll be okay, right?
She won't leave me.
This is fixable.
-Yeah, sure.
-Absolutely.
By me?
Unless you make some big gesture.
Big, though.
The missus!
Gunther, can I get a coffee?
To go.
I still don't want to talk to you.
Tell me how to make things right.
That's what we do.
I mess up, you tell me how to fix it and I do.
And then you think I'm cute again.
I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
Figure this out for yourself.
If you're afraid of a real relationship then don't be in one.
Howard!
Howard!
Howard!
Hi, Ross!
What are you doing here?
I thought this was your party, and it's a party for Howard.
He's the sweetest little man.
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.
Oh, sure.
You chipped in?
Yeah, $100.
I can't believe you gave him money.
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.
But they didn't ask me.
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.
But you're making me look bad.
No, I'm not!
If anything, I'm making you look better.
They'll see you talking to me.
I'm a hit.
Hey, Phoebe!
Hey, Ross.
Maybe you two could switch apartments.
Because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
Think about it.
Okay, my bad.
You look big.
Thanks, I've been working out.
Listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
But it's not obvious why.
I'm breaking up with Katie, so I put on some extra padding.
If she hits me when she is happy, can you imagine how hard she'll hit when I take away the Joey love?
Oh, right.
I forgot that you call it that.
Hey, cute jacket.
Thanks.
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!
Did Joey tell you to say that?
You guys are too much!
You know what?
I gotta tell you I think you're the one that is too much.
Joey has the nicest friends.
And the nicest girlfriend.
You're so sweet!
You're so sweet!
She just kicked me.
Aren't you going to do something?
Do something or I'll walk out that door right now.
Are you going to?
This is a disaster.
Can't I please just go?
I'm talking you up to people.
Give it some time, relax.
Get something to eat.
What did you tell them about me?
I told them about you and Emily.
Trying to get some sympathy.
But you came off as the bad guy.
I told it wrong.
We should talk about that because I don't understand what happened there.
This cake is really good!
Things are looking up.
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!
Who would do a thing like that?
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.
Isn't it time you went home?
Go back to 3B, 3B.
Everyone, calm down!
I have something that I'd like to say.
Who here likes Ross?
Of course you don't like him.
He didn't give you any money.
He raised his own hand when I asked, "Who likes Ross"?
And he's wearing two nametags.
I'll be honest.
When I first met Ross, I didn't like him at all.
Once I got to know him, I saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous.
All I'm saying is, don't judge Ross before you get to know him.
You know, I like all of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?
Kurt?
I thought, abrasive drunk.
Lola?
Mind-numbingly stupid.
You guys.
Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
So I think you all know what I mean.
Obviously, I didn't think they would throw things.
I thought if I kept insulting them you'd defend them.
Then you'd look like the hero.
See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?
I need to talk to her, it's urgent.
I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you.
It's urgent.
I've been thinking about us.
A lot of "us" thinking.
I guess there's only one way to do this.
What are you doing?
Don't do it.
Will you marry me?
What a bad idea.
I can't not look at it.
Why are you doing this?
I don't know.
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
The best reason is pregnancy.
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.
Will you be my wife?
I want you to take a minute and think about how ridiculous this sounds.
I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here now.
None of that came from me.
I never said I wanted to have babies and get married!
I was really confused.
Then I talked to these guys.
Who?
Two divorces and Joey?
She's right, you know?
Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
You know when I said that I want you to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?
You're not ready.
I didn't think I was!
Oh, my God.
What would you have done if I had said yes?
I would've been happy because I would spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
Will you pass that knife?
No, I will not.
You don't have to be mean about it.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?
I was going to ask you to marry me because I didn't say hello to you.
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure.
Chandler?
How long is this going to go on?
I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were.
So a long time.
This is fun!
Remember that "we were on a break" thing?
I'm sorry.
Will you marry me?
That's not funny.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
-What are you guys doing up?
-Finishing the crossword.
Do you know a six-letter word for "red"?
Dark red.
Wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots in here for you later.
Hey, how about maroon?
Yes!
You are so smart!
You guys are so cute.
I know.
See you in the morning.
I love doing crossword puzzles with you.
Me too.
Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Only one left.
Three-letter word.
Not dog, but.
Cat.
You are so smart!
I love you.
I love you too.
The One with the Cop We still need a tip.
All right.
Hold on.
I got it.
Nickel.
-How much do we need?
-Couple of bucks.
Okay, dime.
You guys keep talking.
This could take a while.
Wait, look it!
This is a police badge!
Cool.
But why would a cop come in here?
They don't serve doughnuts.
Could you discover the badge again?
I can do better than that.
I bet somebody's missing that badge.
I should take it back.
But at the police station I'll check their 10 Most Wanted List.
My friend's been number 11 forever.
This could be her year!
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey, Joey.
Is that my sweatshirt?
Yes, it is.
I'm sorry.
I was cold.
I hope it's okay.
It's just that if you wear someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
And I'm not him.
I'm sorry.
I'll give it back.
It's gonna be all smelling like Monica.
Do I smell bad?
You smell like a meadow.
I'm sorry.
What's with him?
The last time Joey went to a meadow his mother was shot by a hunter.
Look what I found.
It's a police badge.
What's that doing here?
I don't see any doughnuts.
Cops and doughnuts.
Come on.
If Chandler had said it you'd all be on the floor.
Cops, doughnuts?
Me?
I still don't know.
I want to make sure I bought the right couch, one that says "Kids welcome here," but that also says "Come here to me".
What?
You say that to kids?
The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, it's not a magic couch.
Well, you picked a great couch.
-Sign here, please.
-Sure.
The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
That's ridiculous.
He lives three blocks away.
I'll take it myself.
Thank you.
All right, Rach, come on.
Let's go.
Are you kidding?
Come on.
It's only three blocks.
It's not very heavy.
Try it.
Oh, I can do it.
You two will really enjoy that couch.
We're not together.
Something didn't quite add up there.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, you.
Her.
I mean, she's very you know.
And you're, like you know?
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really?
You two?
I don't want to do this now.
I'm carrying a heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Fine.
We went out.
Not only did we go out we did it 298 times!
You kept count?
You are such a loser!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Excuse me, ma'am.
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree.
Yeah, I can.
It worked well.
But you shouldn't.
So don't ever do that again.
I won't.
Till I have my next cigarette.
Hold it!
N.Y.P.D.
Freeze, punk!
That's right.
You are so busted.
Book them.
-Who are you talking to?
-Save it, red!
Apologize to the tree or spend the night in the slammer.
I am not apologizing to a tree.
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.
Backup!
Backup!
I'm sorry!
Sorry!
Okay, cancel backup!
Cancel backup!
Didn't you say there was an elevator in here?
Yes, I did, but there isn't.
Here we go!
Don't you think we should rethink the whole hiring movers thing?
No way.
They're a rip-off.
They check out your stuff and come back later and steal it.
It's true.
I saw it on Dateline.
Jane Pauley is the one woman I would kiss.
-There's just something about her.
-Rach, can we concentrate?
Yeah, fine.
I listened to your dumb story.
Okay, go left.
Left.
Left.
Okay, you know what?
There's no more left left.
Lift it straight up over your head.
Straight up.
You can do it!
You can do it!
Okay.
You got it?
-Go, go.
-Good, good.
You got it, right?
You got it, right?
You got Any chance you think it looks good there?
This guy was all: And I'm all, "Buffay!
Homicide"!
It was just so cool!
-You were supposed to take it back.
-I'm having fun doing good deeds.
You can get arrested for impersonating a police officer.
You could get arrested right now!
I'd better take it back.
I'm totally drunk with power.
Yeah.
I didn't know you guys would be here.
-Do me a favor.
Taste this.
-What?
Why?
It's okay, Joe, she's a trained chef.
Actually, I was looking for Phoebe.
Well, you just missed her.
Was that her?
-I gotta go.
-Joey, wait a minute.
Wait.
-What is with you?
-Nothing.
You're acting strange.
All right.
There is something.
I kind of had a dream.
But I don't want to talk about it.
What if Martin Luther King had said that?
I kind of have a dream.
I don't want to talk about it.
Look, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about the girl I'm seeing?
Cool.
I dreamt about the girls he was seeing.
Let's talk about your dream.
I love you.
Your dream?
There was no sex.
I haven't dreamt of her like that since I found out about you two.
More or less.
What was the dream about?
You were my girlfriend.
We were doing the crossword puzzle.
Like you did last night.
That's it.
I'm in love with Monica.
I'll move out.
Joey, come on.
That doesn't mean you're in love with me.
It doesn't?
It could mean anything.
Like you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.
Sounds like your dream.
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me being close and stuff and you want that too.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
If that's what it was, that'd be great.
I wouldn't have to move.
Are you attracted to Monica?
Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
-Not really.
-There you have it!
Well, sure!
I'm just wearing sweats!
But that's good!
You're not in love with me.
You just want a girlfriend.
It's not just about getting a girlfriend.
I could get a girlfriend.
We could sit and do crossword puzzles.
But could we have the closeness like you have?
Monica and I were friends before we dated.
Maybe that's it.
Friends first?
That's interesting.
-You become friends after?
-No, never done that either.
Do you guys have a tape measure?
Yeah.
It's actually in my bedroom.
That's right.
What's up, Joey?
How you doing?
Excuse me.
Is this your car?
Don't park here.
You're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry.
It's not a problem.
It's a problem for me, so it's a problem for you, because I'm a cop.
So am l. Okay.
So you're a cop.
You can park anywhere.
I know, because I'm a cop too.
Keep up the good work.
10-4.
Wait.
So, what precinct are you with?
I'm with the 57th.
-I know a guy in Homicide up there.
-I'm in Vice.
In fact, I'm undercover right now.
I'm a whore.
Who else is in Vice there?
Do you know Sipowicz?
Sipowicz?
I don't think so.
Yeah.
Sipowicz.
Yeah.
Big guy, kind of bald.
I don't know him.
Don't try to call him.
He's not there.
He's out.
His partner just died.
Tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I sure will.
Take care.
By the way, I'm sure Sipowicz will be all right.
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.
Where'd you find my badge?
Could you give me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
I'd love to, but I got acting class.
But you know what?
I guess I could blow that off.
For you.
Let me ask you something.
I was talking with Monica and Chandler.
Boy, they are really tight.
I know.
That's not a bad situation they got there.
Think I'll get me one of those.
What's up, Joe?
I think Monica and Chandler are so great because they were friends first.
So I asked myself, who are my friends?
You and Phoebe.
I saw you first, so.
-What are you saying?
-Maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
You know, honey as flattered as I am that you saw me first I just don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah.
Well, you know.
I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.
But the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.
Don't hit on your existing friends.
Won't that take longer?
Oh, but once you find it it's so worth the wait.
I understand.
Good.
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
Come here to me.
No, no.
You come here to me.
-I brought reinforcements.
-Great!
You brought Joey?
The next best thing.
You brought Chandler?
The next best thing would be Monica!
I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so.
I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
Rach, that's you.
That's the couch.
What's that?
That's me.
Certainly think a lot of yourself.
No.
That's my arm.
I see.
I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Just follow my lead.
Come on, Chandler.
-All right.
-Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
Ready?
Turn!
Turn!
Turn!
-I don't think we can turn any more!
-I don't think it'll fit!
Yeah, it will.
Come on!
Up, up, up!
Up!
Yes!
Here we go!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
I don't think it'll pivot any more.
You think?
All right, let's bring it back down and try again.
I think it's really stuck now.
-I can't believe that didn't work.
-I know.
Me neither.
I mean, you had a sketch.
What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
Man, I cannot figure this out.
Yeah, because it's not 1985.
You guys, guess what?
I ditched a cop.
-What?
-What do you mean?
He caught me using his badge and he tried to bust me.
Damn real cops!
How far did he chase you?
Well, he didn't really.
He just picked up his badge and stood there.
Maybe we'll see you on World's Most Boring Police Chases.
-Why did you run?
-I had to.
You know, impersonating a cop is like a Class E felony.
Two to four years minimum.
I am not going back to that hellhole.
If I can just get it to pivot we'll be back on track.
-Rach, can I get some help please?
-Yeah.
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
Maybe the firemen can help us move the couch when they get here.
-Wait, wait, wait.
-It's a new couch!
It's a new couch!
How's it going?
Make any new friends?
Yeah.
I met this woman.
What's she like?
Well, she's really good in bed.
-You were going to be friends first.
-Hey, it's all your fault.
Why?
You didn't give me advice.
You gave me a pickup line.
I told her I wanted to build a foundation and be friends first.
Suddenly, through no fault of my own, I became irresistible to her!
And her roommate.
What about the closeness?
Closeness, schmosness.
There was three of us, for crying out loud!
Who wants pizza?
I do!
I do!
I do!
This is great!
Can you believe I found it on the second floor?
-Who is it?
-N.Y.P.D.
Oh, my God!
Just a minute, officer!
-I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay.
-My God, it's him!
It's that cop!
-I can't believe he found me!
-Are you gonna go to jail?
If I go down, you guys go down with me.
Harboring a fugitive?
That's one to three years minimum.
Good luck, Chandler.
Arrest me, but you'll never make it stick and you know it.
I have no choice, it's my job.
You understand, right?
And you understand that I'm calling my lawyer.
And once he puts you on the stand, he'll make you look like a fool!
I don't like looking foolish.
Maybe I don't arrest you today.
Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I'd love it if I weren't here!
Since you're not going to jail tonight, I was wondering if you'd Iike to go to dinner with me?
Me?
Ever since you flashed my badge I can't stop thinking about you.
You're the prettiest fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Nice.
I didn't see that coming.
You're asking me out.
I could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
I'd like to go out with you, officer.
-Gary.
-Gary.
Okay, so it's a date.
I gotta ask you, though.
How'd you find me?
I ran your fingerprints through the computer.
This was listed as your last known address.
Impressive.
Not as impressive as you.
Your record shows you've done some weird stuff.
We'll talk at dinner.
-So I'll come by and pick you up?
-I can't wait.
Don't worry, I won't just take you out for doughnuts.
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch.
I'm not satisfied with it.
You wanna return this couch?
It's cut in half.
-That's what I'm telling you.
-Did you cut this couch in half?
It's crazy, it is cut in half.
I don't understand.
This couch is cut in half.
I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.
We can't accept it in this condition.
Well, I can't accept it in this condition.
You're saying this couch was delivered to you like this?
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.
I will take it.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
-Good!
You guys are all here.
-What's up?
I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
Congratulations!
Oh, boy.
That guy's underwear sucks!
-What?
-Well, I got this pair marked "XS".
Let me tell you, there was no room for excess anything in there.
I'll be the coordinator of the women's collection.
I'll work right under the director.
It's the perfect job for me!
If you nail the interview, you'll get it.
You want to work on your interview skills?
Let's start with the handshake.
Very good handshake.
Good wrist action.
Let me try.
Oh, my God!
What did I ever do to you?
Did I squeeze too hard?
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
The One with Rachel's lnadvertent Kiss That's right, Ross.
I can see you in your new apartment.
Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Is he doing his "shark attack" bit?
No.
Oh, wait!
There he goes.
Very funny, Ross.
Very lifelike and funny.
No, no.
I wasn't waving at you, lady.
Whoa, maybe I was.
This hot girl in Ross' building is flirting with me.
Get in there, man.
Flirt back.
Mix it up!
Yeah, I'm down with that.
Okay, here goes.
How you doing?
It worked!
She's waving me over.
I'll be right over.
Let's see, she's on the third floor.
-She is pretty, huh?
-Tell me about it.
No, no!
I'm not with her.
That's just Monica.
Hey, Joey!
Great stuff, huh?
This your place?
Yeah, of course it is.
Come on in.
Go by the window.
You can pretend to be surfing.
I counted.
You're not supposed to live here!
Oh, man!
What happened?
I ended up at Ross' place.
I must have miscounted or something.
Damn!
She's not there anymore.
Look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Okay, now I really have to go.
It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
-I know, but it's my job.
-Then maybe I could come too.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
-Oh, God!
-What?
Oh, I just miss him so much!
For just a week, you guys are close.
Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it.
He's so sweet.
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
But like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.
I love the beginning parts of relationships.
You can't keep your hands off each other.
I know.
It is the best.
How long did that last for you and Chandler?
What?
It's still going on.
Come on, seriously.
When did it end?
I am serious.
We're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do.
Why don't you just calm down?
Get all your facts before you tell everybody you're the only hot couple.
God, I woke the beast.
I was wrong, obviously.
I just misspoke.
It's okay.
It is okay.
As long as you know Chandler and l are also hot and fiery.
Just as hot as you.
I mean, our flame.
It is on fire!
Here's your broom back.
You are so cute!
The cute bar keeps getting lower and lower, doesn't it?
How'd the interview go?
Horrible!
I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.
Did you say you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?
Did you get drunk on the way over there?
Well, that explains why you didn't do the other stuff.
So, what happened?
It was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.
I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah, if you've got enough life jackets".
Trust me.
It was actually very funny.
Anyway, we were saying goodbye and.
What happened?
We were shaking hands and he leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was opening the door but I totally misread him and I. You kissed him?
I didn't know what else to do!
You could have tried not kissing him.
Thanks, Chandler.
A guy from Ralph Lauren called.
You got a second interview.
Monica, that's not funny.
Oh, okay.
A guy from Ralph Lauren called You got a second interview Oh, my God, Monica, you better be serious.
You just told me to be funny!
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it!
I got a second interview.
That kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?
You don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah!
No?
What are you talking about?
I accidentally kissed him in the interview and now he wants me back because, "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody"!
Come on, Rach.
What if he thinks I'll just sleep with him?
He wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe.
I don't know.
Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?
Rachel, don't say that.
I think you just need a hug from Joey.
Come on.
Come on.
She's back!
Hot girl's back!
Well, I'm not totally back yet, but I appreciate it.
No.
In Ross' building.
She's back!
Wait there.
I'll be over in a second.
One, two, three.
Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl.
There she is!
Damn it!
Did you move?
Yes.
I lived with you for a while.
Then I found this place.
I'm Ross.
Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No, I'm all alone.
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Hey, little girl.
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter, by any chance, a hot girl?
-Daddy!
-Later, girl!
Oh, man!
Hot girl?
Hot girl!
Hi, Rachel.
Come on in.
-It's nice to see you again.
-Thank you.
What?
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, let me Okay, I see what's going on here.
Now, look I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
But I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.
Even though I kissed you, that does not give you the right to demand sex from me!
I do not want this job that bad.
Good day, sir.
If you're going in there to see Mr. Zelner, I hope you're ready to put out.
I am.
You are not gonna believe what that sleazeball from Ralph Lauren did to me!
Okay, that's amazing!
How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
We're not supposed to do that.
What could happen?
I mean Yeah.
I'm gonna say no.
-Do you want to see a movie tonight?
-We can't.
We already have plans.
What are you doing?
Well, same thing we did all day.
Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
He is so amazing.
We never left the bedroom.
But have fun at the movie.
Well, we're not seeing a movie.
Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Because I just wanted to know what you were doing so you wouldn't walk in on me and Chandler while we were doing it all night.
Will you excuse me?
Chandler?
Can I see you for a second?
-We have got to beat them!
-Why?
Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than us.
So?
So we've gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!
You've got to stop this competitive thing.
It's crazy.
Just to impress them, you want us to have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why?
Get your coat!
Excuse me.
You should check this out.
Tell the other tenants.
Apparently, he's looking for some kind of hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ross.
I know.
You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Never mind.
I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
I mean, you had just moved in.
I had just moved in!
Thank you!
Listen.
Jen.
I know this may sound a little.
But would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
Sure, that would be nice.
My number's on there.
Give me a call.
I will give you a call.
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest, huh?
No one is hotter than we are.
-We're the best.
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.
-No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey, guys.
What you been doing?
Isn't that the girl who waved at you?
I don't know, but I can see through your sheet.
Yeah, that's her.
You know, it doesn't matter.
I'll never meet her.
It's impossible to find her apartment!
She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.
What are you talking about?
She lives on the 2nd floor, No, she lives on the 3rd floor, No.
Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.
I almost lost another girl because of counting!
-So you ready?
-Yeah, I'll just get my coat.
-Could you get that?
-Sure.
No!
No!
First, I would like to say thank you for seeing me again.
That's all right.
But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not yell at you and storm out.
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.
I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back.
That shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no.
That shows integrity.
And I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage.
Now, I know that I've already said courage but you've got to have courage.
And finally, when I thought you were making sexual advances I said no, and I was not litigious.
So there you go!
You got courage you got integrity, you got courage again and not litigious.
Look, Mr. Zelner.
I knew that!
Oh, I knew that.
I really, really want this job.
And I think I would be really good at it.
You know what?
I may regret this but I'll give you a shot.
You are?
Really?
Thank you.
Oh, God!
Would it be inappropriate if I gave you a hug?
Well, how about a handshake?
Oh, God!
I'm sorry!
I did not mean to touch that!
I mean, you!
There!
I'm gonna leave.
Thank you very much.
Hey, I'll see you Monday.
Are you tired?
You better believe he's tired after the day we had!
If you know what I mean.
Do you know what I mean?
Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
Do you like that badge I got you?
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
We kind of took a detour on our way over here.
We were strolling through the park and no one was around, so.
-You didn't.
-We did!
We violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
The park, huh?
Public place.
I hear you.
Can you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Chandler.
Monica, this is the men's room.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.
Haven't you?
No.
And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.
Okay, I don't want to disappoint you and I really don't want to disappoint the guy in the second stall.
Sorry, man.
But come on, this is getting ridiculous.
Come on, we can't let them win!
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?
Phoebe and Gary are in that "can't keep their hands off each other" phase!
So?
It makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.
Oh, is that what this has all been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were all over each other all the time?
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.
But the truth is, I'm more excited about where we are now.
-Really?
-Yeah.
I've never been in a relationship this long before.
To get past the beginning and still want to be around each other I think that's incredible.
And the fact that this is happening with you I think that's pretty exciting.
That's so sweet.
I know that I was acting a little crazy but I feel the same way.
You know what I just realized?
You just freaked out about our relationship.
-I did not.
-Yes, you did!
Admit it.
You freaked out!
I freaked out a little.
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.
I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
Thank God!
I can't watch him anymore.
You guys ready?
By the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man, they cannot get enough!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Pick a card.
All right.
Now, memorize it.
-You got it?
-Oh, yes.
Is that your card?
Yes.
-Hey, guys.
-Hi there!
Guess what.
Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
What are you talking about?
It's not for sure, but we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was cute.
You know, which he is.
He gave us his card and told us to bring him for this commercial he's auditioning.
This guy's the biggest commercial casting director in town!
Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
I mean, way to go, Ben!
I've been in that park a million times and no one's offered me an audition.
It's crazy.
We were pushing Ben on the swings I'm always on the swings!
What am I doing wrong?
That.
The One Where Rachel Smokes -Gotta go.
Wish me luck.
-Good luck.
Since you work at Ralph Lauren, can you get me some shirts?
I don't know if I'd feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
Unwilling to steal from work.
Interesting.
If anybody gets free stuff, it's me.
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
Go get 'em!
Let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
But her birthday's not for another month.
If we throw her party on her birthday, it's not a surprise.
Great!
We can have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Ross!
We're having a surprise party for Rachel.
Done.
Great.
Wanna do it together?
I'd love to do it together!
They're gonna do it together.
That's my girlfriend.
So I gotta shut it down now?
I gotta go.
I'm picking up Ben and then we're off to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Weirder than seeing his two moms make out?
Dad?
There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah.
The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Maybe I'll go with you and audition as the dad.
Who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
-You're not his godfather.
-What?
Are you kidding?
Of course I am.
-Okay, let's go, godfather.
-All right!
They're gonna let me audition!
Really?
That's great!
One of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play.
So I steered clear of her.
And the other one, I know from.
Well, you know.
-That kid looks familiar.
-Oh, yeah.
He's done tons of commercials.
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation and that one for the phone company.
He was so good, he convinced me to switch phone companies.
Chandler was mad.
He's not gonna get this one.
Ben is way cuter than that kid.
I mean, look at him.
That's great.
Wouldn't it be great if I got to play Ben's dad?
You look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do.
I really don't know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one.
I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?
Well, that one is pretty but I just love this fabric.
Sorry.
Don't be.
Part of your job is to give your opinions.
Then I take credit for them.
I'm kidding!
She is kidding.
But don't ever disagree with her again.
Okay, now I'm kidding!
What a fun office.
I don't know which one.
But I do know I need a cigarette.
Let's take a break, go outside and sort this out when we return.
-You smoke?
-No.
My dad's a doctor.
And he would always tell me horror stories.
About ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess' right to smoke.
And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions.
-That's not fair.
-I know.
It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
Yeah, it is the best.
What if this keeps happening?
They'll be smoking, making the decisions and I'll be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air.
And when Kim wants to promote one of us who do you think she'll pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?
We used to have a smoking area at work.
It was great.
There was this big flowerpot with dirt in it.
We used to put our cigarettes out in it.
One of the old-timers told me there used to be a little tree in there.
You can go down there and not smoke.
Say you want some fresh air.
I could do that.
Or you could do the easy thing and smoke.
You gotta take long, deep drags.
Wow, I still don't have my lung capacity back yet.
Rach, do you wanna go get coffee?
-I would love to.
-Oh, good.
I'm gonna go too.
Oh, good.
Oh, I changed my mind.
Let's talk about the party.
I have so many ideas.
Me too!
Oh, look at that.
This is a little sketch of the cake.
See?
Some sample menus.
I thought we'd start with a Tuscan-style finger food.
And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
I've highlighted the ones that'll go with the food.
-What about the intimate dinner party?
-We're not doing that.
Looks like you took care of everything.
Thanks a lot, cohost.
Wait a minute.
There's plenty of things for you to do.
Like what?
Cups.
You're giving me cups?
And ice.
Cups and ice?
I get to be in charge of cups and ice?
All right.
Fine.
I will be in charge of cups and ice.
-I can get ice at the restaurant -I got it!
-How did the audition go?
-Not so good.
Wait a minute.
Are you doing Joey's: "The audition didn't go so well.
Yeah, it did"?
Yeah, I am!
-Yeah, Ben got a second audition.
-That's great!
I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
You got a callback too, didn't you?
Yeah, I did!
What are you doing out here?
It got kind of lonely up there, so I thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
We're discussing the fall collection.
Oh, great.
Anyway, we really -Sorry.
We're smoking all over you.
-That's okay.
We'll move.
You stay there.
I sent the designs to Ralph.
He was excited about it.
That's great!
You are the best!
Excuse me.
Can I bum one of those?
Actually, this one's.
What's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
You know, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.
You know what I mean?
Doobies?
Actually, I thought to myself, "Those guys are crazy"!
But no, I smoke the regular ones all the time.
We get high.
Me too.
I'm kidding.
Me too.
Oh, God!
This is so nerve-racking.
How do you do this?
Fortunately, I don't get many callbacks, so.
Is it a good sign that they asked us to wait?
Who knows?
We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you.
Yes!
I knew it!
Bye-bye.
So long.
Later.
I'm not married to him anymore.
He's my ex-husband.
I'm totally gay!
This is great!
I might get to play Ben's dad.
Actually, that can't happen.
Because you have such different looks we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it'll either be you two or you two.
-This is gonna be kind of weird.
-Yeah, it is.
Yeah.
It's gonna be weird.
No.
We're like best friends.
That's why it's weird.
I thought we were just talking.
If Ben gets this commercial, do you think you can get me some free soup?
Chandler, a can of soup is like 60 cents.
Yeah, okay, but I have been supporting a 29-year-old ltalian for five years.
Is it okay if I leave this here till Rachel's birthday party?
-Sure.
What's in them?
-Cups.
Good, because we got Rachel That's a lot of cups.
I'm in charge of cups and ice.
And Monica's gonna rue the day she put me in charge of cups and ice.
You know, I rued the day once.
Didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
Ross, I'm glad you're here.
-I want to talk to you.
-What's up?
I've been thinking about this commercial thing.
Me against Ben.
The two of us competing.
That can't lead to anything good.
I think I'm just gonna step aside.
I'll tell them that I won't audition.
Joey, that's great.
Thanks, man.
That's it?
You're gonna let me do this?
It's my career we're talking about!
But you just I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
If anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
-What?
-Chandler, tell him!
Well, let me get the door first.
Hi, no one!
Why should Ben step aside?
It was his audition in the first place.
You tagged along.
You're like the tagalong dad!
At least I care about his feelings.
What?
You know how hard it'll be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Come on!
Have you seen what my kid can do?
He dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.
He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon, baby.
Oh, yeah?
I guess we'll see!
This commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
-Your kid's name is Raymond!
-Yeah?
So is yours!
-How did work go?
-lt was great.
I went down there like you said.
And we talked business.
And Kim took my opinions.
You stink!
-Thanks.
-No, I'm serious.
That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.
But there's something different Oh, my God!
You smoked!
I did not.
Yes, you did.
You look happy and sick.
You smoked!
All right, fine!
But I had to.
I had to do it for my career.
I wish I had to smoke for my career.
But it's so gross!
It's not that bad, you know?
Yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.
I actually feel like I could throw up.
-Can you hear yourself?
-I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm not myself.
I smoked like half a pack.
I feel a little shaky and a little weird.
But you gotta push past this, okay?
Because it's about to get so good.
You smell so smoky, I gotta get up.
I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great.
So we're decided.
No on plaid, yes on pink.
Absolutely.
I'm so onboard.
-Didn't you just light that?
-Yeah.
But you know what?
I'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.
Good luck, Rach.
I've been thinking about quitting.
Every Sunday night, I tell myself I'm quitting.
Every Monday morning, it's like: Tell me about it.
We'll just quit.
Let's all quit!
It sounds appealing.
-I never could do it.
-But you could.
Absolutely.
We can help each other.
We could get those patches.
We could be like the Patch Sisters.
You know, we really should quit.
Okay, let's quit!
Great!
Give me those cigs.
Come on!
Give it!
Out.
Done.
Quit.
My late husband gave me that lighter.
I'm not kidding.
Okay, then.
Mmmsoup.
Mmmsoup.
Would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
-No problem.
-Thanks.
So you want to be an actor?
I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.
I mean, one day, you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.
The next day, you're eating ketchup out of the bottle.
It's a tough life.
I mean, sure, you can get up whenever you want watch TV all day meet tons of women in acting class.
Oh, who am I kidding.
I can't talk you out of this.
It's a great life.
-Joey.
-Ross.
Ben.
I mean, Ben.
Ben.
Raymond, Joey, you're up.
So here's what.
Are you sure that I haven't seen you somewhere before?
No, I haven't been in any plays.
All right, let's try one.
Whenever you guys are ready.
Is there a problem?
Well, this is noodle soup.
And I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay.
No problem.
Mmmnoodle soup.
You know, that's fine.
But the line is, "Mmmsoup".
-What'd I say?
-"Mmmnoodle soup".
How's that different?
All right.
Let's try one.
Mmm noodle soup.
Let's do it again.
Mmmsoup.
I mean, noodle soup.
I mean, soup!
Come on!
You know what?
We need to move on.
No, I could do it one more time.
Look.
Mmmnoodle soup.
Damn it!
So I think that if we get these samples into the magazine by Monday, we'll be fine.
Sounds good.
So, Rach, how you doing?
-I'm great!
-No, with the not-smoking thing.
Kill me now.
Let me tell you something, I ate 40 Mallomars today.
I mean, I have patches all over my body, you know?
-I mean, I haven't slept in two days.
-We quit yesterday.
That's counting today.
But anyway, so these samples, I think Oh, my God!
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
I have to go to the mailroom and mail some proofs.
Go ahead.
Rachel and I will just sit here and keep brainstorming.
Also, Vogue called.
And they were wondering You know what?
I'm a little hungry.
I'm just gonna run down to the vending machines.
All right.
Busted!
Come on!
What are you doing?
I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
That didn't work out.
Wait a minute.
What about all we've talked about?
You know, the disgusting place, the ugly people.
Hey, how you doing?
We tried to quit.
But it was too hard.
If you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
Give me one.
What are we talking about?
Don't you give up.
That's why we didn't tell you, and we won't drag you down.
Wait.
No, no.
Drag me down.
Forget it.
We're so proud of how well you're doing.
I won't let you blow it.
If I catch you, you're fired.
Go on, get out of here.
I don't want you breathing this stuff.
So, okay.
You'll come with me on the Paris trip?
Oh, man!
Check it out.
Cup hat, cup banner cup chandelier, and the thing that started it all: the cup!
Great job with the cups.
Why don't you just go out with her?
Did you notice the ice?
Look!
We have it all.
We have crushed, cubed and dry.
Watch.
Mystical.
No one's eating my food.
They're eating her snow cones!
There are snow cones?
-Go, go!
-Thank you.
-You really did do a nice job.
-Thank you for stating the obvious.
I deserve that.
I just want you to know that if we ever cohost a party together again -you can do whatever you want.
-Joey's got a birthday coming up.
-Really?
What do you wanna do?
-Okay, I'd like to be in charge of beer.
Well, then there's nothing left for me.
-Look, look!
-Surprise!
What?
My birthday is not for another month.
That's the surprise.
Oh, my God, you guys!
This is so great!
It's so unexpected.
I mean, Chandler's birthday is even before mine.
Surprise!
This is so great!
Look at all these cups.
This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay.
Not so weird.
-Chandler, what are you doing?
-Nothing.
-What's in your hand?
-Money.
I'm stealing all the money.
Chandler.
But just one, okay?
Because nobody knows when my birthday is.
Let me make this clear to you, okay?
It's either that or this.
They were menthol.
Listen, man.
I'm sorry the audition didn't go well.
Yeah, right.
No, really.
I am, Joey.
I feel bad.
Look, Ross.
You don't have to, okay?
It's not your fault I suck.
What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mmmnoodle soup"?
You know what?
Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
What do you mean?
I think, subconsciously You lost me.
I think, on some level, you sabotaged your own audition so Ben would get the part.
Your way sounds a lot better than mine.
It's not that I'm a bad actor.
No, it's just that I care so damn much about little Ben that it was more important for me to see him succeed.
-There you go.
Thank you.
-Thank you.
-So did he get it?
-No.
What are you gonna do?
Is Rachel Green here?
I'm meeting her for lunch.
She doesn't come down anymore.
You'll find her on 10.
Okay, great.
So we talked about the presentation.
He wondered if one person would be enough.
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely".
I'll catch you guys later.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Wow!
You look nice.
What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating our 10-month anniversary.
Got reservations at Jean-George.
How'd you get in?
Made a few calls, pulled some strings and they'll seat us if we both have chicken and don't get dessert.
-Hi, Chandler.
-Hey, Caitlin.
Somebody got a haircut.
I hate it.
I look like an 8-year-old boy.
If that was true, gym class would've been more interesting.
-It's $27 even.
-Okay.
Here you go.
Where's the chicken?
It's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.
He said that eggs came first.
-Thanks.
I'll see you later.
-Bye.
What the hell was that?
-What?
-The flirting.
Aren't you supposed to be going out with, let's see, my sister?
I wasn't flirting.
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut".
First of all, the impression?
Uncanny.
Second, that wasn't flirting.
That was just casual conversation.
Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you.
I'm good.
The One Where Ross Can't Flirt I am so proud of Joey.
-He's gonna be on Law and Order!
-I know.
Don't you think it should be called Order and Law?
No, because they arrest the guy and then try him.
Don't get me started on that.
-I was not flirting.
-And on your anniversary.
For shame!
What's going on?
He was hitting on the hot delivery girl.
I was not.
And oh, God!
You were.
If anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single the guy who can do something about it.
Sounds like someone wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?
Ross, we broke up two years ago.
You've been married since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people.
I was watching her at the pizza place.
And she was just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little We don't need her measurements.
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.
She's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?
She forgot my vegetarian.
This is perfect.
She'll have to come back here with your pizza.
And when she does, I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
I am so glad you don't eat meat.
See?
Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.
-Big night!
-Yeah, it's so cool.
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be proud.
She doesn't understand a word of English.
I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.
I've done it again.
Nonnie's my biggest fan.
She's the only one in the family who's always believed in me.
Si.
Big star.
My big fat Joey star.
Yeah, I weighed, like, -Happy anniversary!
-Happy anniversary, 10 months.
In the shower I was thinking about our first night in London.
Joey's grandmother's right there.
-The one who speaks English?
-The one who doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me.
-I'll get ready.
-Wear those earrings I got you.
That's a great idea.
I was saving them for something special.
-You've got to go home.
-But I like it here.
Get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.
I need those earrings you borrowed.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Phoebe, you speak ltalian?
I guess so.
-Here you go.
-Thanks.
Where's the other one?
Oh, what, you want both of them?
That's a little greedy, don't you think?
Rachel Karen Greene, where's the other one?
Look, just don't freak out, but I kind of lost it.
I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.
-Tell her to wear her own earrings.
-These are her earrings.
You lent me her earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
-Why not?
-Because I lose her stuff!
You see that blind guy?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.
My big scene's coming up.
The big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up," would she know the difference?
What are you doing?
Oh, I just can't watch.
It's too scary.
It's a diaper commercial.
Yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities.
-Pizza delivery.
-I'll get it!
I will get that!
How does my hair look?
Ross, it hasn't moved since 1996.
One vegetarian pizza.
It's 12.50.
By the way, if it makes you feel any better I happen to like What?
Your hair.
Before.
Your hair.
You said you thought your hair looked like an 8-year-old boy's and I'm just saying I like it.
The hair.
Thanks.
You understand, I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
All I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go.
Stop bringing us pizzas, you.
I'm gonna try.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her, could you?
This is a girl I really like, and you had to swoop in there!
What?
Chandler was flirting with the hot delivery girl.
Thank you for that.
I was not flirting.
It's okay.
I don't care.
That's fine.
Really?
It's no big deal.
I do it all the time.
You flirt with guys all the time?
It doesn't mean anything.
Just like it doesn't mean anything with you.
There's a difference.
You're a lot hotter.
True story.
This actually bothers you?
Yes, and I think it'd bother a lot of people.
When you and Ross dated did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you for that.
I never had to worry.
He was never good at the flirting thing.
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.
No, you're right.
We met, you flirted and then bam!
Nine years later, you had me.
All right.
You know what I'll do?
I'll order another pizza.
And when Caitlin gets here I will show you how well I flirt.
I will get her phone number.
And not the one on the menu.
-I found it.
-Thank God!
Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay, that is the one we already have.
Here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.
-Wanna bet nobody heard anything?
-No bet.
Anybody home?
-Oh, my God.
-What?
Everybody keep smiling.
It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.
What is it?
They cut me out of the show.
What?
-Are you sure?
-Maybe your scene's coming up.
Not likely.
Because you see that body bag right there?
I'm in it.
This is terrible.
What'll you do?
I don't know.
This little old lady lives for my career.
When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
That's not good.
-Yeah, we had to get her a home nurse.
-Oh, my God.
Yeah, she almost died and got really expensive.
You're not smiling.
Not that face!
Everybody smile!
Just tell her what happened.
It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way, won't we freak her out soon?
Soon.
I'm gonna be on soon.
There I am!
Sam Waterston!
No, no.
That's me.
That's me!
No.
Sam Waterston.
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.
She doesn't know "hello," but she knows Capricorn One.
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.
But I already gave them back to you.
No, you didn't.
I already didn't gave them back to you.
That's what I said.
Where's that other earring?
It's not here, Phoebe.
It's not here.
I went to Chandler's last night.
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Chandler has a jewelry box?
We have 10 minutes.
Do you want me to get into that now?
Hey, Phoebe.
How's that vegetarian pizza working out for you?
You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?
Do you like it?
No.
That'd be, "Why are you being cute"?
Okay.
I'm working on my flirting.
I did not get that.
So, Monica, do you like Law and Order?
Yeah, it's good.
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order and you've flirted with every guy in the tri-state area.
Okay, let me get this straight.
It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
I'm glad we cleared that up.
I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.
Teach me about men and women.
I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.
When you flirt with a guy, you think, "No big deal".
But he thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me".
-No way!
-It's true.
-Well, that's pathetic.
-Again, true.
-This goes for all guys?
-All guys that are awake.
We go to sleep.
All guys from the other end of the world wake up and act the same way.
It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.
Joey, this is the last commercial.
-You got 10 minutes left.
-I know!
What am I gonna do?
You will not run out and leave her here.
Yeah, all right.
Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.
So you're old and small.
-Did you find it?
-The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.
I've been looking for these since last summer.
Those are mine.
You borrowed them from me.
Okay.
Calm down.
Here they are.
-What do we do?
-I don't know.
I don't know!
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh, God!
She's gonna kill me.
I could tell her it was all my fault.
Oh, that'd be great.
Mon, could I talk to you?
Yeah.
What is it?
I lost one of your earrings.
I'm sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
All right, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.
I'll replace it.
I promise.
I feel so terrible.
That's fine.
You didn't do it on purpose.
Look at you.
Come here.
-You feel better?
-Yeah.
You're the best.
Okay, wait a minute.
I can't do this.
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
She lent me the earrings.
I lost it.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
First, my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.
And if it's not that, it's my sunglasses.
Your sunglasses?
Oh, right.
-Pizza.
-Mine, mine, mine!
Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some class-A flirting.
Okay, hold on.
If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way You'll see.
What's her name?
Caitlin!
We can't keep eating like this.
It's $12.50.
Do you make the pizzas in one of those wood-burning ovens?
No, actually, I think they're gas.
Gas?
Intense.
If this is how all the Gellers flirt, we don't have a problem.
You know that smell gas has?
They put that in.
-What?
-The gas is odorless.
But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Well, okay.
A lot of other gas smells.
Oh, the humanity!
Methane smells.
You know what?
Actually, I really should go.
-But I haven't paid you yet.
-That's okay.
You guys have ordered so many that this one's on me.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I found it interesting.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry about it.
In nine years, she and l will be right there!
I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
What else do they add smell to?
Caitlin!
Caitlin!
Hi, I'm Rachel.
The people with all the pizza.
Was there a problem?
No, they're fine.
Great pizza.
But, actually, my friend Ross he gets nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, my God!
That was flirting?
I know, I know.
I'm telling you, once you get past that part where it feels like you wanna die he's a really good person.
The guy with the gas?
I'm telling you, he's really sweet and really funny and he's just got a good heart.
You know, actually, I did think that he was cute and then he started talking.
See, there you go.
-Besides, I think he really likes you.
-Really?
Well, we have seven people and 10 pizzas.
What do you think?
I thought Joey was there.
Yeah, no, but just I'm telling you he's worth a shot.
Well, if he's so great why don't you go out with him?
Well, you know, at some point you and I may need to have a longer conversation.
Hey, Ross?
I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway.
You must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.
-What?
-I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her number.
And she just gave you this?
Rach, thanks.
But I don't need you doing me any favors.
I didn't.
She thought you were cute.
Well, that I can believe.
Hey, is the show still on?
Almost over, man.
Hey, Nonnie.
Is that the pope?
Why am I looking?
Oh, here I am!
This is my big scene.
All right, back off!
I got a gun!
I'm not afraid to use it.
That's right, Nonnie.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt?
Now, I want a suitcase filled with $ 100,000 Filled with $ 100,000 in small bills.
And if I don't get Shoo!
And if I don't get it I'll shoot this duck!
Oh, no!
I'm coming out!
And she's supposed to buy this?
Ground control to Major Tom Commencing countdown Engines On That's scenes from next week's show.
Next week.
I am definitely gonna watch that.
Do these look the same?
-Definitely.
-Not as each other.
Then, no.
-Hey, you ready?
-Yeah.
You look amazing.
I'm the luckiest man in the world.
You're about to get a little luckier.
-Let me see the earrings.
-Right, the earrings.
They look great.
Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have great taste.
Thanks for picking out the earrings.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Okay, guys, listen.
Tomorrow, Emily gets married again.
So try to really keep Ross' mind off of it.
Good idea.
Hey, man.
What's up?
Just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.
Oh, Ross!
Look, look!
What?
Where?
Right over there!
There!
Look, look, look!
-What am I looking at?
-Somebody help me out here.
Hey!
Monica, sorry I didn't come by.
I was out with Gary.
He let me ride around with him.
We saw and prevented crimes.
You got to go on a ride-along?
-I want to go on a ride-along!
-Me too!
-Okay.
-Yeah!
Me too!
Really?
You?
Yeah.
-Well, it's kind of dangerous.
-Well, I like danger.
-Okay, you guys free tonight?
-Yeah!
You didn't say it was gonna be at nighttime.
The One With the Ride-Along I'm so glad you're home.
We can finally organize these photos.
Oh, thank God!
Finally!
I've broken them down into categories.
We got holidays, birthdays, candids.
And I've cross-referenced them by subject.
So if you're looking up, say birthdays and dogs, you get photo 152.
See?
Oh, it's me and LePoo.
Wow, I miss that dog.
You can also find him under "dog" and "dead".
Great.
Thanks.
Hand me that other box of photos.
That's the last one.
Oops.
Sorry.
Good thing you numbered them.
I hadn't.
Photo 152 was a prototype.
Honey, it's okay.
It's okay.
How about I fix you a drink?
Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender.
Everything's just falling apart.
It's okay.
I'll go to Ross', get the blender.
-You get the margarita stuff ready.
-All right.
His keys are in the drawer.
Also, I need some cash.
Want me to stop at the ATM?
No.
While you're at Ross', if you see any lying around.
-What?
-What?
I don't do that.
That was so cool, man.
The way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything.
You cracked him.
He was the victim.
They're usually pretty talkative.
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
-Want me to grab the berry for you?
-It's called a cherry.
It's called Chandler!
Okay, I got it.
This place makes the best sandwich in the world.
Does it have meatballs?
Oh, yeah.
Melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yep.
You can't eat that in my car.
Yeah, okay.
Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Wow, that sandwich smells good.
Did I say you could smell it?
I can't smell it?
Half the taste is in the smell.
You're sucking up all the taste units.
Okay, I'll give them back.
What is so great about that sandwich?
Imagine the best sex you ever had.
-Are you thinking about Monica?
-Yeah.
What's that like?
Please don't be from a real dinosaur.
Please, please.
Please, please.
"Made in Mexico".
Yes!
Who would buy this?
Rach, it's me.
Pick up!
What's up?
I need a few more things for the margaritas.
I need some salt, some margarita mix and tequila.
So all we had was ice?
See if he has ice.
Hello, Ross?
It's Emily here.
I know this is out of the blue, but I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, maybe I am.
I keep thinking about you.
And I'm wondering if we made a mistake giving up so fast.
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
Where we going?
This witness won't return my calls.
We'll surprise him coming home.
Surprise him?
We're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?
Come on, man.
You gonna squeeze the perp's shoes a bit before he lawyers up?
He's a witness, not a perp.
And no one talks like that.
Yeah.
No one talks like that.
-Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
-I'm more cop than you two.
How do you figure that?
I'm in the front seat, okay?
I'm Gary's partner.
When you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.
It sounds gay.
Jealous.
-Hey, we're undercover here.
-Oh, yeah.
No problem.
-Ross!
-Sorry.
There.
Hey, Gary.
Who am l?
Phone home.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
What's up with that, Serpico?
"What's up with that, Serpico"?
Are you thinking about me?
No, of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
No.
I know!
Thank God you were here.
We have to erase that.
What?
We can't do that.
We have to.
What if Ross hears that and calls her back and they get back together?
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
No!
Oh, no, no.
God, no!
He should not get back with her.
I know that, you know that.
Even Ross knows that.
But we have no right to erase his message.
Look, I'm his sister and I love him.
I don't want to see him get hurt.
Doesn't that give me the right to control him?
Help him?
He's not the one who needs help.
She's obviously unstable.
She's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
Okay, fine.
But look at the position she's putting him in.
And what's he gonna do?
Run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?
Who would do that?
Okay, fine.
All right.
But that was different.
Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
This is some twisted joke she's playing on him.
You are crazy.
She sounded genuinely upset.
I mean, listen.
Your messages have been erased.
No!
Well, that worked out well.
Margarita?
Okay, but we're safe, right?
Nothing bad's gonna go down.
No.
But that reminds me.
Sign this.
What is it?
It just says you can't sue if you scrape your knee or get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up.
I want to sign that.
Here he comes.
What is he doing?
What the hell is he doing?
What is it?
-ls everything okay?
-What?
He sees us.
Don't move.
And don't look at him!
Hey, it's okay.
It was just a car backfire.
Hey, look at that.
You tried to save your buddy.
You see that?
You see what he did?
You okay, man?
Thanks, Joey.
Hello?
Hi.
You all right?
We should go.
No, wait.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
No.
Monica.
Monica, we have to fix this.
What can we do?
You erased the message.
Yeah, but maybe I could call his machine and re-create the message.
All right, okay.
Hello, Ross, this is Rachel Emily.
God, what is it with those two names?
I do so wanted to say that I'm going to be getting married to another British person.
And I'm having doubts and scones.
-I can't remember what she said.
-Yeah, that's the problem with this plan.
Rachel, come on.
The message is erased, there's nothing we can do.
He's never gonna find out.
I could tell him about it.
If you want to be rational, I can't argue with you.
All right?
Fine, tell him.
I just don't want to be a part of it.
Maybe that's Emily leaving the exact same message.
Hey, Ross, it's you.
I just want you to remember this feeling.
You are lucky to be alive.
So live every day to the fullest.
Love yourself, okay?
And also get stamps.
Bye.
Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
Right?
Anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?
No.
Joey.
Joey's never been in outer space.
We had the most incredible night.
-We're in the car -Wait.
Hold on.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Okay, go ahead.
So we're in the car, and bang!
A shot was fired.
And Joey, with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me.
My God!
It was a car backfire.
But he didn't know that.
Yeah, I didn't know that.
It could just as easily have been a bullet.
Ever think about joining the force?
We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises.
Wow.
I could have died tonight.
Yeah, if the car that backfired had run over you!
I'm gonna go home, before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh, my God!
Ross, I could have told you you weren't gonna die today.
What?
You know when I'm gonna die?
-You want to get some dinner?
-Sure.
You know what?
If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.
Okay.
Bye.
Cut it out.
I'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.
Why'd you take off?
Just going for a walk.
Around the living room, whatever.
-ls something wrong?
-No.
No, I'm just tired.
You know, from the walk.
You dove in front of Ross!
Ross!
That's what this is about.
Oh, my God.
You hate Ross!
I don't hate Ross.
Of course you do.
I saved him.
You're mad at me.
It adds up.
You want Ross out of the picture.
What picture?
I don't know.
But I don't like what I'm hearing.
I'm glad you saved Ross in the car backfire.
But it could've been a bullet.
And you didn't try to save me.
You're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
You know?
I mean, Ross needs help.
He's not "street" like us.
You'd risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
That's the bottom line.
No, not exactly.
All right, look.
I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay?
My sandwich was next to Ross.
All right?
I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet?
-I know it doesn't make much sense.
-"Much" sense?
Look, it was instinct!
I just went for it.
You risked your life for a sandwich?
I know it sounds crazy but this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
So you didn't choose Ross before me?
No.
I would never do that.
You're like my brother.
-Really?
-Yeah.
In fact, to prove how much you mean to me.
Here.
-Thanks.
-Easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
What are you doing?
You're showing me how much I mean to you.
With a bite.
Jeez!
What are you doing here?
Hey, you know what?
You are in our apartment all the time!
This is just a drop in the bucket, mister!
It doesn't matter.
The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend and you're here.
Okay, just a little scared.
What's going on?
The most amazing thing happened tonight.
I thought my number was up.
I had an actual near-death experience.
What happened?
We were on the ride-along with Gary and somebody took a shot at me!
Really?
No.
A car backfired.
But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me.
And, Rach I survived!
And I was filled with this great respect for life.
I want to experience every moment.
I want to seize every opportunity.
I am seeing everything so clearly now.
Because a car backfired?
Okay.
Why are you here?
I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but Emily called you today.
-You talked to her?
-She left a message.
But it kind of got erased.
I mean, there's something wrong with your machine.
What did she say?
Something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
And she wants you to call her.
Wow.
That was a good thing that I told you, right?
Yeah.
Yes.
Of course.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Because I'm gonna go tell Monica I was right.
Because she didn't want Not important.
Point is, I was right.
Your decision.
Okay?
I was right.
Your decision.
Right.
I guess I should call Emily.
No, that's not the right decision.
That's not right.
Ross, come on!
I mean that woman made you miserable!
Do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look.
Yesterday I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
But my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near-death experience?
That's gotta mean something.
That was not a near-death experience.
That was barely an experience.
You weren't there!
Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
Okay.
You know what?
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Okay?
Look at today.
I mean, you escaped death.
And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.
That does make sense.
Because I do want to seize some opportunity but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!
Yeah, maybe today's just "close call" day.
Hey, thanks, Rach.
Oh, honey.
No problem.
Wait, wait.
The message is blinking.
Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, Ross, it's you That's an old message.
Nobody needs to hear that.
-Hey, was Monica here?
-Yeah.
I want my money back.
You probably need that for stamps, right?
Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes, once.
A little.
He kind of did it to himself.
It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I'd react under fire.
And not backfire but heavy fire.
Like, if I was in a war.
Man, I would be great in a war!
I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know Joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us.
If the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
You all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
But when the revolution comes, I'll have to destroy you all.
Not you, Joey.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I'll get coffee.
Want anything, baby doll?
I'm fine.
Thanks.
I can't pull off "baby doll," can l?
No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.
I'll make some tea.
How you doing, pumpkin?
-So it's going well for you two?
-I know.
Really well.
I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
What do you think?
It's great!
When will you ask her?
Tonight.
But don't say anything.
I swear.
I promise.
I'm so excited!
But listen, do not get her flowers, okay?
Because she cries when they die.
Then there's the whole funeral.
-I'll see you after work, sweetie.
-Okay.
Bye.
So, what movie should we see?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!
What?
Really?
He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!
I can't believe this.
Right?
Because it's fast.
Because it's so fast.
It's fast.
Relax.
It's Phoebe, not you.
Good for you, Phoebe.
Way to go.
No, but it is fast, isn't it?
-I like him, but I'm not ready.
-So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him!
Me?
Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment.
You talk to him.
Make him scared like you, make him a man.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it'd do.
I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet.
Still terrified.
I'll take care of it.
The One With the Ball Hey, Ross, is Staten lsland really an island?
That's why they call it Staten "lsland".
Oh, I thought it was like Long lsland.
Also an island.
-What time is it?
-2:17.
We haven't dropped this ball for an hour.
Are you serious?
I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't say anything.
I didn't wanna jinx it.
We are pretty good at this.
We totally forgot about lunch.
That's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
I think my pants are a little loose.
Hey, you guys.
Is Monica here?
I bought something.
I'm not sure she'll like it.
It may seem crazy, but I've wanted this since I was a little girl.
You bought Shaun Cassidy!
No.
I wish!
Okay, you ready?
Check it out.
What is it?
What the hell is that?
It's a cat.
That is not a cat!
Yes, it is!
Why is it inside out?
Excuse me!
But this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.
How much did you pay for that?
It was extravagant, but I got a good deal.
-How much?
-Thousand bucks.
On a cat?
It's not a cat!
For a thousand dollars, you'd think at least it'd come with hair.
Or something.
All right.
Listen, ball boys.
My grandma had one when I was little.
It was the sweetest thing.
It would sit in my lap and just purr all day long.
I would drag a string and it would chase it.
Free cats do that too, you know.
It's not a cat!
I'm really excited about this, okay?
I don't care what you think.
I'm gonna set up a litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
What am I gonna call her?
Fluffy?
Do you wanna get something to eat, or see how long we can throw this ball?
The ball thing.
Wouldn't it be great if we could go for two hours without dropping it?
Yeah, it would!
Let's do it.
I have to pee.
And Rachel's in the bathroom!
Man, I didn't think we'd make it.
I know.
Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey, ladies.
What are you in here for?
What are you doing here?
I am here to report a crime.
It's a crime that we don't spend time together.
What's up?
You're thinking about moving in with Phoebe, and I thought we should talk.
You know, man to well, me.
Sure, okay.
Are you crazy?
Are you insane?
If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be living together.
I considered that.
It'd make me happy.
-You mean scared.
-No, I mean happy.
Scared happy.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to open your eyes!
If you live with Phoebe, she is always gonna be there.
You get home, she's there.
You go to bed, she's there.
You wake up and, oh, yes, she's there.
I know.
I can't wait!
Were your parents happy or something?
I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
I just want to be around her as much as I can.
When you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I think I do.
You know what?
Move in with her.
Move in right now.
Maybe I'll move in with Monica.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
You're right about that.
When they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
How did it get there?
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hey, guys.
I left my watch here last night.
-lt was here.
Where is it?
-I don't know.
I'm late for work.
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.
Can you stop throwing the ball for one minute and help me find it?
Oh, I don't know.
Yeah, can't do it.
-What?
-Do not drop that ball.
We haven't dropped it in.
Two hours, 27 minutes.
Really?
I won't make it in to work today.
I don't feel very good.
For a second, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
Hey, Rach.
Check it out.
Almost three hours without dropping it.
Congratulations.
That's quite a waste of time.
You have scratches all over you.
Well, it's my cat.
-Oh, I got a cat.
-I don't want a cat!
Don't worry, it's not a cat.
You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
It's not sweet.
It's not cute.
I dragged a string, and it flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel"!
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me $300?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Did you talk to Gary about moving in?
I think you should do it.
He's a great guy and he loves you a lot.
You are a very lucky lady.
You are useless!
Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do and you can't even do that right!
Sorry.
If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
Get out of here, good-for-nothing.
Hey, Chandler.
Hey, Gar.
Hey, sweetie.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You look pretty today.
Thanks.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
I really want this relationship to move forward.
If you're not moving forward, you're moving backwards.
No, if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
And staying still is good.
Watch this.
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet.
But don't you think it's too soon?
There's so much we don't know about each other.
Okay.
I get it.
I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for.
I don't want to mess up what we have.
I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Which is why my answer is yes!
Really?
You're so happy.
Monica, stop throwing it so hard!
We're on the same team!
You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right, baby.
-All right.
Let me in.
-No, no!
Don't do it!
What?
He's a dropper.
Oh, yeah.
That's right!
I'm not a dropper!
It's really a three-person game, you know?
It's throwing and catching.
All right.
Oh, it's so hard.
Don't worry, guys.
It's not a cat.
Oh, good God!
I give up.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
Baking it didn't help?
Take it back to where you got it.
I tried.
They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
Why won't they take it?
They said they would only give me store credit.
What am I gonna do?
Get 1000 regular cats?
You said it was a show cat.
Why don't you show it, win some prize money.
Those shows cost a hundred bucks to enter, and all you win are these ribbons which technically belong to the damn cat.
You can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
That's not the point.
I'm out $1000 I'm all scratched up and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Oh, my God!
The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me!
My vision's been compromised!
Oh, God!
Okay.
It's okay.
Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
-We have great news.
-We're moving in together.
Yay!
Congratulations.
-I'm so excited!
-So am l. You're not more excited than I am.
No way.
I'm the most excited.
See you at the station later.
I'll see you later.
Don't forget about the moving-in!
So you're moving in with him?
I couldn't tell him no.
He got so sad.
Maybe it'll be all right.
I do like him a lot and probably do it eventually, anyway.
Plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Do you write him a lot?
I heard when people live together they split the cost of stamps, don't they?
-Yeah, yeah.
-That's right.
Sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, honey.
Did you find any apartments in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.
-Nothing at all?
-No.
If something opens up, we'll move in.
If it has a pool.
I need a pool.
Can I talk to you?
Take a seat.
You okay?
You feel all right?
I feel great, because we're moving in together.
So you.
You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You checked the Post?
Yeah, there was nothing.
-Can I get some water?
-ln a minute.
You checked today's Post?
Yeah, today's.
Because this is today's Post.
And these are the listings I found.
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights!
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.
Let me tell you what's going on here.
Don't look at the table.
Look at me.
Somebody asked someone to move in with him.
Someone said yes, but now she has doubts because things are moving too fast.
Does that sound possible?
Yes, fine!
I am someone!
You want me to say it?
I have doubts!
I'm sorry!
It's okay that you feel this way.
It is soon, and there's things we don't know about each other.
Everything I know about you, I really like.
Things I don't know, I'll learn in a place with our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
But if it's too soon for you, we don't have to do it.
I want you to be happy.
Living with you would make me happy.
You don't have to say that.
I want to live with you.
I want to move in with you.
Are you sure?
Definitely, yes!
Let's live in an apartment we both live in.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, wait, one sec.
Hey, you!
Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?
I always wanted to say that every time I was in these rooms, which was never.
Show cat!
Quality show cat!
-Show cat!
-Oh, my God!
What's wrong with your baby?
That's not a baby.
That's a cat.
-It's creepy-looking.
-Oh, no.
It's actually very sweet.
It's very sweet.
Look.
Yeah.
Do you want it?
No, I hate cats.
Then what are you doing to me?
Get out of here, all right?
Move on!
What an unusual cat.
Yes, thank you!
Exactly.
You want it?
Maybe.
I was thinking about getting a cat from the shelter, but.
-Okay.
Why not?
-Oh, terrific!
That'll be $2,000.
-What?
-Okay, 1000.
Didn't you want me to adopt your cat?
I do, but you'll have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah.
I just wanted a cat.
Obviously, you know how to haggle, so I won't try and take you on.
So $800, and I don't call the cops, because you are robbing me blind!
Blind!
Just take the cat.
Leave the money.
Run away!
Run away.
Damn it!
Can't you at least smile or something?
Did anybody just hear that?
Anybody?
-I'm starving.
-Come on, guys.
Suck it up!
We're closing in on 10 hours.
It's gut-check time!
I don't know who made you the boss.
We invented this game.
I made this game what it is!
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry.
There's pizza at my place.
We can eat with one hand.
Are you with me?
-I am.
-All right, let's go!
Come on!
Let's go, Team Monica!
We can work out the name later.
What is your cat doing in my bowl?
I'm defrosting a chicken.
I sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Thank God!
-Get your money back?
-Yeah, $1500.
You made a profit?
I just came for the red velvet pillow.
-There you go.
-Thanks, Rachel.
Don't forget, you can come visit her anytime.
Oh, good.
Great.
I'll keep that in mind.
So is this some kind of snake or something?
I like waking up with you.
I like waking up with you too.
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.
I could stay here all day.
That would be great.
-We could have breakfast in bed.
-Wait, just a second.
Oh, no.
All right.
Come on, Monica!
Look alive.
Come on!
Oh, I was having the best dream.
-What?
-I dreamed I was drowning and not throwing this ball.
Oh, good.
You're all up.
It's 6:00 in the morning.
Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh, yeah.
That's over.
Gary's such a great guy.
You can work it out.
-He shot a bird.
-That is over.
-I'm sorry.
-That's terrible.
Are you okay?
I'll be all right.
Here, Phoebe.
I don't feel like playing.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It didn't happen.
No one needs to know.
She's not an official ball player.
Only official ball players can drop the ball.
-Come on.
-Let's go.
You wanna get breakfast?
Okay, let's race!
First one there wins.
You guys wanna eat here?
That was great, huh?
Can you believe how long we threw it?
It is amazing it lasted that long.
My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
How did I get this reputation as a dropper?
I am anything but a dropper.
Ross!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
What's going on?
My eye is a little itchy.
Mine too.
Yeah.
It's really red.
You should go see my eye doctor.
I'm not gonna see your ex-boyfriend.
That's all I hear.
Richard, Richard, Richard.
Since we've dated, I've said his name twice.
Okay.
So Richard, Richard.
It's not Richard.
It's this new guy.
He's good.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to an eye doctor.
-Oh, God.
Here we go.
-What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she, like, freaks out.
Watch.
Ross, come on!
I have a weird thing with my eye.
Can we not talk about it?
Hey, Rach.
You know that great song?
"Me, Myself and Eye".
Monica!
Come on!
All those in favor of getting lunch, say, "eye".
Ross!
Stop it!
How much did I love The King and Eye?
Chandler!
Me too, me too!
Just stop it!
That's enough!
-You okay there, man?
-Yeah.
I got too excited.
The One with Joey's Big Break I gotta go.
I'm taking Ben to the park.
-Give him a kiss for me.
-All right.
Bye.
Later.
I'm so sorry you got caught in the middle of that.
I didn't mean to be so out there, but I am furious with him.
Calm down?
I'm trying.
Man, that guy can push my buttons!
Why are you so mad?
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-lt seems like You wanna be on my list too?
Keep talking.
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?
No.
What's it look like?
-A piece of paper and it says, "Ross".
-I see.
I just got off the phone with Estelle.
Guess what?
I got the lead!
You got the lead in a movie?
What's it about?
It's called Shutterspeed.
It's really cool.
I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in, like, a day.
And then she disappears.
But I find out where she lives.
This old lady answers the door.
I say, "Where's Betsy"?
And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years".
Chilling!
The best part is, we're filming in the desert outside of Vegas.
-You know what that means.
-I know.
Road trip!
We can rent a car.
I have to be there by Tuesday.
Wait!
My grandmother's dead.
We can talk about that too, Phoebe.
No, her cab.
She probably won't be using it.
Drive it to Las Vegas.
All right!
Thanks!
What are we gonna do about my job?
Not go.
Great!
Road trip, baby!
Is this okay?
Chandler, you don't have to ask for my permission.
You can go.
Rach, we'll be late for the eye doctor.
All right.
Let's get this over with.
Look what I did.
I mean, look at this mess.
We're gonna probably have to clean this up.
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule!
If you thought that this mess was gonna bother me, you are wrong!
All right, let's go, Blinky.
Hey, Joey.
What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas.
You've traveled a lot, right?
Yeah, I've been around.
Which route should I take?
The north or the south route?
If you take the north route, there's a man with a beard of bees.
Great!
Problem solved!
On the south route, there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
I know a way that you can decide.
I'll ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes!
Good.
But wait.
Here we go.
I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath.
Clear your mind.
-Peanut butter or egg whites?
-Peanut butter.
-Be a fireman or a swimmer?
-Swimmer.
-You'd sleep with Monica or Rachel?
-Monica.
I always thought it'd be Rachel.
-No thinking.
Tie or ascot?
-Ascot.
-North or south route?
-North.
Bam!
There you go!
Huh?
That was incredible!
Beard of bees here I come!
This guy again.
Hey, what's up?
Not much.
Wanna see a movie tonight?
What do you wanna see?
I don't know.
I know how to decide.
Show him your game.
No, thank you.
What's with her?
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.
I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick.
-Action or comedy?
-Action.
Who would you rather sleep with, Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
I'm sorry.
I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh, my God.
What does that thing do?
-An eye removal machine.
-I'm out of here.
I'm kidding.
Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.
Monica said you were nervous.
Everything will be fine.
-So we're done.
-Almost, but first we gotta start.
This is a glaucoma test.
Sit down.
Put your chin here.
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?
A small puff of air.
Now, come on!
Here we go.
One, two, three.
I'm sorry.
All right.
I'm gonna stay in here this time.
Ready?
-One, two -I'm sorry.
You know what?
I'm gonna hold her head.
That's okay.
I'm sorry.
You're young.
You don't have glaucoma.
So it was very, very nice to meet you, sir.
What are you?
Are you crazy?
You got a small, minor infection in that left eye.
Take these drops for a week and you'll be as good as new.
No, I don't put things in my eye.
We'll see you here in three months.
And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Give me the damn drops!
Dr. Miller?
P-E-C-F-D.
Very good, Monica!
-You know where they are.
-I sure do.
And you don't get one.
You know, those eye drops are a miracle.
My eye is 100 percent better.
-They're still in my coat.
-Damn!
You ready to go?
How cold will it be there?
Will all these sweater vests be enough?
-What?
-I love you.
I wish Ross was coming with us.
I'll miss him.
Thanks.
I just got that jerk out of my mind.
Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Not really.
It's an independent film.
We don't have a big budget.
I'll stay in your room.
Once you get paid, you'll be springing for a suite.
They must be paying you a lot.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
You don't get paid unless it makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
"She's been dead for 10 years".
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
I wanted to say goodbye.
And to see if you guys would place a little bet for me.
Twenty bucks on black 15.
-You got it!
-All right.
-You remember the number, right?
-Yeah, black 13.
-Black 15!
-You got it.
-All right.
Bye-bye, now.
-Bye, you guys.
I'll say bye at the car.
Anyone wanna say bye to me at the car?
I'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the pus.
See you!
But wait a minute.
The pus is good.
It means it's healing.
Hey, Phoebe.
What you reading?
Hello?
Come on!
Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Phoebe, are you mad at me or something?
If you are, please tell me what it is I did.
-lf you don't know, I can't help you.
-I don't know.
Well, I can't help you.
Well, whatever it is, I am very, very sorry.
Okay?
Apology accepted.
So we're good?
I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, fat-ass.
All right!
Will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me?
I don't know!
I don't remember!
What do you mean, you can't remember?
I was so focused on being mad at you, I forgot what it was I was mad about.
If you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh, no.
I am mad at you.
I know that much.
But I'm sorry about the fat-ass thing because you have a sweet, little heinie.
I'm getting pretty tired.
You'll have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour.
You haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry.
It's out there.
Maybe I just need lunch.
You wanna eat?
My treat.
Isn't that Ross' money?
Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat?
I don't know.
I know how we can decide.
I'll ask you questions.
And then you have to answer real fast.
So clear your mind.
Clear it right out.
Clear it out.
It's all clear except for this image of a small, purple lamp.
Is that all right if that stays in there?
I don't see why not.
I guess.
You have to answer with the first thing that pops into your head, okay?
-Would you rather be too wet or too dry?
-Too dry.
-Do you believe in ghosts?
-No.
-Will this movie be my big break?
-No.
-What?
-Yes.
-Dude, you said, no.
-I also said, yes.
-This won't be my big break?
-No.
I don't believe this.
Look, I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.
What are you talking about?
I'm the lead in a movie!
They're not even paying you!
This doesn't sound like a real movie!
I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
I don't think this is gonna be your big break.
Are you on this trip to make me feel like a loser?
-I'd rather be alone.
-You don't want me here?
Not if you're like this.
The next time you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.
I don't want you on the trip.
Why don't you pull over.
I'll get out now.
Fine.
Get out.
You can't stop on a bridge.
-Get out!
-Fine!
Wait!
Wait!
There's no sidewalk!
Yeah.
I'm gonna die here.
Are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
Because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No.
That made me feel precious.
Because he's always correcting people's grammar?
"Whom, whom".
Sometimes it's "who"!
Yeah?
Sometimes it's: Did you beat him at a board game?
He's such a baby when he loses.
Okay, I'm the baby.
Hey!
Stop it!
What are you doing here?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the bridge.
-Why?
-I don't know.
He went crazy.
We played that game where you ask questions and answer fast.
That game should not be played without my supervision.
I don't know what made him mad.
All I said was that this wouldn't be his big break that it wouldn't do anything for him and that it didn't sound real.
Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.
What's in the bag?
I figured you'd be mad at me so I got gifts that I found on the roadside.
-Who wants the one-legged teddy bear?
-I do!
-Not even close.
-I need help!
I can't do this.
Come on.
Let's do it.
Sit down.
All right, put your head back.
-Now open your eyes.
-Okay, they are.
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Four.
I was thinking four.
-Really?
-Yes!
Why don't we start with a practice one.
-No drops.
-Great!
On three.
One, two, three.
My pillow's all wet!
Well, you said it was practice!
Why did you move?
I knew you were lying!
-Come here.
-What are you doing?
Stop it!
Oh, my God!
I am going.
Turn it over!
I am going to get get these drops in your eye.
Oh, my God!
You really are freakishly strong.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it!
Damn, it's empty!
If Joey and Chandler walked in now, we could make a fortune.
That is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.
Or Rachel.
It's Joey.
Chandler told me what happened.
He's really upset.
Not as upset as he'll be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.
What did you do to them?
There's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
I gotta ask Phoebe something about the car.
Hold on one second.
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, Phoebe.
This wooden box keeps sliding out.
What is it?
My grandma.
And thanks.
She's having a great time.
Is that Joey?
Let me talk to him.
Chandler's here.
He was wondering if I guess he ran out of change.
How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Send him something.
So when he gets there, he'll know you're sorry.
That's a good idea.
I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
No, don't say, "I'm sorry," with porn.
You should send him a carton of cigarettes.
Because that way he can trade it for protection.
No.
That's prison.
I know how we're gonna figure this out.
Clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
-Do you like flora or fauna?
-Fauna.
-Simon or Garfunkel?
-Garfunkel.
-Why are you mad?
-You said I was boring.
When did I say that?
Oh, my God!
I remember now!
We were playing chess.
Phoebe, you and l have never played chess.
Remember that time on the frozen lake?
We were playing.
You said I was boring.
Then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz.
There's a chance this may have been a dream.
So this entire time, you've been angry with me because of a dream?
Well, guess what, now I'm mad at you.
I wanted to make sure this wasn't a dream.
Otherwise we're wasting our time.
Stanley!
Your leading man is here.
Let's get to work.
Slight change of plans.
We've shut down.
What?
Why?
It's a money thing.
We don't have any.
You're kidding, right?
What?
It's probably just temporary.
We're hoping to get some money soon.
Just hang out.
Hang out?
How long?
I don't know.
A week.
Maybe two.
The money will turn up.
People always wanna invest in movies.
You're not rich?
Worth a shot.
Well, Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey, pal.
Are you Joey Tribbiani?
These got left for you.
Thanks.
"Congratulations on your big break".
-Monica, it's Joey.
-Hey, Joey.
You remember me even though you're a star.
Come on.
It'll be years before I forget you.
What's it like on a movie set?
Do you have a dressing room and a chair with your name?
Yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
Tell Chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.
I gotta go, Monica.
My sushi's here.
Sorry about that.
Thanks for waiting.
Everybody smile.
Thanks a lot.
Enjoy your stay at Caesars.
We hope it's toga-rific.
Kill me.
Kill me now.
Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?
Go!
What are you doing?
Get off!
Oh, my God!
Hold it open.
Okay.
We'll see you in about three or four hours.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
-Phoebe, could you get that, please?
-Why?
Just because you're too lazy to get up off your tushy?
No, it's just that all the people in the world I would want to talk to are right here.
Sucker.
Hello?
-Hey, Joey!
-Hey, Phoebe.
I need a favor.
I forgot the PlN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?
Sure.
Where is it?
I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
So you're 5-6-3-9?
That's it!
Thanks.
-Wanna talk to Chandler?
-Let me talk to him.
He didn't believe in my movie which is a big mistake, because it is real.
Real.
Tribbiani, get back to work.
Break time's over.
-Who was that?
-My stunt double.
Yeah.
He's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
I've tried to apologize.
If I can't do it on the phone, I'll go and do it in person.
I heard that.
Can you put him on?
Don't come out here.
I support you 100% and I wanna prove that to you in person.
I got that.
I forgive you.
Don't come out here.
You haven't taken my calls for a week.
I'm totally over it.
Friends forever.
Don't come out here.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
-What was that?
-Entertainment Tonight.
Good talking to you and don't come out here.
The One in Vegas Monica?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?
That's okay.
What the hell took you so long?
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.
-Which Richard?
-The Richard.
Richard Simmons?
Oh, my God!
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?
It was really nice.
We talked and I had lunch with him.
That's weird.
I dreamed you had lunch with Richard.
-Really?
-Again, Richard Simmons.
Go on.
The strange part was he was really nice and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything.
So why can't we tell Chandler?
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.
I don't wanna spoil it.
I can't believe you guys have lasted a whole year!
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
On a totally different bet.
-It's almost our anniversary!
-I know.
One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
I got you a gift.
-It's not till tomorrow.
-I know, but you have to open it today.
Okay!
There you go!
It's two tickets to Vegas!
Yeah!
For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start our celebration on the plane.
We can call it our "Plane-aversary".
Do we have to?
This is great, but Joey didn't want any of us there.
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.
Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
"Anna-vada-versary"!
I think we should see other people.
We can go, right?
Great idea.
I'm gonna go too!
Phoebe, it's kind of our anniversary.
You won't ditch me like you did with London.
Ditch you?
You were pregnant Great story.
I'm going.
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
Including me!
Do you wanna go?
I can take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit.
I waited a year for this.
Art lover.
What'd you say?
I said, art lover.
-Was that supposed to be an insult?
-I don't know, I'm very tired.
-Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
-Sounds great.
I'll call the airlines.
That'll be nice to have the apartment to myself.
To walk around naked.
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So far, it's pretty much the same, Phoebe.
What about after I give you these candies?
I guess it's a little better now.
Las Vegas, 1.
London, 0.
I'll be back.
Happy Plane-aversary.
I love you.
-Can I give you your present now?
-Okay!
Oh, don't tell me I did this.
I love "l forgot the present" fake-out!
How about "I did forget the present, forgive me" not fake-out?
You can give it to me when we get back.
This is the worst thing that could happen.
You decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What "Richard thing"?
Oh, no.
What "Richard thing"?
Simmons.
Go with Simmons.
I ran into Richard yesterday.
He asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
I didn't tell you because you'd get mad and I didn't wanna spoil our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really?
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite".
No big deal.
Great.
Okay, London, 1.
This is gonna be a real horserace.
Oh, look what happened.
Check me out.
I'm in my kitchen naked.
I'm picking up an orange.
I'm naked.
I'm lighting the candles.
Naked.
And carefully.
Oh, my God!
That's Rachel, naked!
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.
Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
She knows I'm home.
She knows I can see her.
What kind of game is she playing?
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
You're being silly.
Or am I?
Love to love you baby Love to love you baby Love to love you baby Darn it!
May I come in?
Yeah, if you want to.
Do you want me to?
Yeah, sure?
So do l. Okay, Rach, before anything happens I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
This is just about tonight.
I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us".
I just want this to be about what it is.
And what is that, Ross?
The physical act of love.
What, are you crazy?
So you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
Oh, God.
You saw me?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
You actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
Oh, wow.
I'm sorry.
But, Ross, you kicked off your shoes.
-Can we just forget this ever happened?
-Of course.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
-Thank you.
-Yes.
-I guess I'm gonna go pack.
-Okay.
Wait, one more thing.
Do we still need to settle the question of "us"?
Hey, you guys, wait!
You guys.
This place is much better than London.
A lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me this.
Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner.
You don't eat animals.
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
I can totally settle down here.
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey!
Look!
Look!
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Love your condoms, my man.
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.
Hold on a second.
Can we cut?
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.
Who are you talking to?
The director.
Her.
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.
Why?
What happened?
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.
I'm working here till it starts up, if it ever does.
-I'm so sorry.
-Such a drag.
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.
Apparently there's a new policy of not sharing.
-I knew you weren't okay with that.
-So you're a gladiator!
What's going on?
-Monica had lunch with Richard.
-Dawson?
But that would've been so cool!
Her boyfriend Richard.
It meant nothing.
After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky men and don't tell me!
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
Thanks.
-There we go.
-Now I love Vegas.
I promise you next time I absolutely will tell you.
-"Next time"?
-So close.
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.
That's funny, I think I just did.
If you act like this, I won't be around you.
-Fine.
-Happy anniversary!
Guys, please!
Come on, come on.
This is obviously a misunderstanding.
No, it is not.
Don't look at me.
I just work here.
Okay, Ross?
I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.
Now, I'm just letting you know this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep, that's hilarious.
I'm sorry.
I'm done.
I'm done.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really.
You've seen me naked hundreds of times.
But it was a first for the rest of my building.
That's true.
But I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?
You totally get embarrassed.
No, I don't.
Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
-ls that so?
-Yeah.
Hey, lady!
I don't care how much you want it, okay?
I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, sure.
They would scrub the floors.
They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
Sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.
So they would stick it right I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.
He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
Can you believe that?
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
Build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
Wait!
Why don't I just do what that guy did?
I'll take this $100, turn it into $5000 and I'll turn that into enough to get my movie going!
Good luck.
I don't need luck.
I've thought this through.
I see.
Thanks.
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.
You had a minor setback in your relationship.
Big deal.
It's only Chandler.
I am so sorry.
This is crazy.
Such a stupid argument.
I don't wanna see Richard.
So go fix it.
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.
Tell him sorry and you love him.
You're right, Phoebe.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
Yeah!
Las Vegas!
Number one!
Anybody lose this?
Coming out.
Place your bet.
Dice her out.
Yellow 11.
Pay the front line!
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?
What are you?
I am sorry, sir.
I think he just really likes you.
You know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
-Can I help you?
-Yes.
Do you have any extra pants?
My friend seems to have had a little accident.
-Can I change $100?
-Changing $100.
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.
That's right.
-Thirteen.
-Hit me!
Oh, man!
Wait!
You are not gonna believe this!
I have found my identical hand twin.
What?
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
What does it sound like?
It's a guy with my identical hands.
It was incredible.
The dealer's hands were exactly like mine.
It was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
You sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
-How?
-I don't have it all worked out yet.
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!
Again, I must go back to how?
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!
How much would you pay to see this hand twice?
I can't really put a price on that.
Are you un-supporting me again?
I support you 100%.
I just didn't get it right away.
Now I'm caught up.
Identical hand twins.
It's a million-dollar idea!
Right?
I know.
Okay.
All right.
What's that for?
Well, I gotta document this before that dealer gets off his break.
I found my identical hand twin!
Oh, you're so lucky!
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?
But she just came up here.
That was Joey.
I wonder where she is?
It's so weird.
She's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that?
You know what she said after her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.
-Really?
-Yes.
She feels terrible.
She really wants to make up.
You've gotta find her.
Good.
I should really start wearing hats.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
-Did you enjoy your flight?
-I did.
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.
-I hope you had a nice flight.
-Oh, it was the best.
I think the check-in is that way.
Kids love me.
Hi, you guys are here!
What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?
Let me guess.
Pancho Villa.
And you're Bob Saget.
Pancho Villa?
What are you talking about, Phoebe?
I don't Oh, my God!
You drew on me?
Hey, you wet my pants!
What kind of party was this?
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.
It's the third time she's won on a machine I was playing.
I bet she's one of those people.
Mole people?
What?
No, a lurker.
What's that?
When you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out a lurker waits for you to give up and then Kills you?
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
-How do you know about this?
-My nana used to do it.
That's how she paid for my dance Karate lessons.
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
-lt won't come off.
-What?
It won't come off.
Oh, my God.
Rach, are you sure?
I took it off and then I drew it back on.
Rach, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sure we can get it off, okay?
-Just give me your pen.
-Why?
What are you gonna do?
Well, I believe I'm going to stab you repeatedly.
Not here.
There are cameras everywhere.
You made it!
Who's your friend?
He's hot.
Thanks, man.
Listen, I talked to Chandler.
And I'm sorry about the movie.
Don't be sorry.
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.
Your what?
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.
-Were you looking for this person?
-Not even.
This thing is a gold mine.
What?
That won't make you any money.
Well, fine.
None of you will live with me in my hand-shaped mansion.
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.
All right, baby, come on!
I am on fire!
See you later.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
Going home.
Why?
Wait.
Sorry, I was just playing for one second.
If you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't.
He means nothing to me.
Oh, come on.
I was there.
I know he's the love of your life.
Not anymore.
Really?
Really.
All right?
Let's forget about going home and celebrate our anniversary.
Okay, this is empty.
I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
Tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this?
I don't know about the hands, but he went to the restroom.
How you doing?
-Very busy.
-Right.
Okay.
Yes, hello.
I have a question.
I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No, she didn't think so.
I know.
It's like Anyway.
Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried everything and nothing's worked.
What do we do?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's not coming off.
What?
What else did he say?
He said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs we'll have some fun and you will forget all about it.
There's no way I am leaving looking like this!
Come on, Rach.
It's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!
Just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you can't have fun.
Besides, no one will even look at you.
This is Vegas.
Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.
There are tons of freaks here.
No other.
No.
Come on.
No one will notice.
I swear.
There was some staring and pointing.
I need a drink.
They really overcharge you for that stuff.
But who cares, because it's all on me.
That is one big drink.
Macadamia nut?
Wow!
That's some pricey nut.
Really like those macadamia nuts?
Nope.
Get out of here, you lurker!
Go on, get!
You made up.
I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
She couldn't live without the "Chand love".
Get a room.
-We have one.
-Use it.
Bye, Chandler.
Bye, Mon.
Phoebe, Phoebe.
Please pick up a house phone.
You have a call from Chandler and Mon.
Hello, Chandler and Mon.
Hello?
You dirty lurker!
I'm sorry, you are the same old lady, right?
Yeah.
Dirty lurker!
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.
Excuse me?
It's me.
Joey.
Do I know you?
Joey?
Yeah, the hand guy.
So, what are we gonna do about this hand twin thing?
Nothing.
Look, you and I have been given a gift.
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling.
Or magic.
And you know NASA's gonna want to talk to us.
I have to get back to work.
We can have our own show.
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!
And I wrote a song for us.
This hand is your hand This hand is my hand Oh, wait, that's your hand No, wait, it's my hand -That's okay.
-But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Oh, my God.
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.
All right, you know what?
We don't have to go downstairs.
We can bring Vegas up to us.
All right, come on.
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.
-Thirteen.
-Hit me.
Twenty-three.
Which is what we play to at this casino!
You win 10 dollars!
-I bet 20.
-Right.
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!
I've never seen a roll like this!
That's right, baby!
What do I want now?
Eight?
-Six.
-Pick a number!
That is your only job.
-Eight.
-Thank you.
If you get this, we buy everybody a steak dinner.
Eight it is.
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?
-No.
-Okay, good.
-What do I want now?
-Try a hard eight.
-What?
-Two fours.
Eight!
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.
You get this and we get the biggest suite in the place.
We get the biggest suite in the place.
The biggest suite in the place!
Come on!
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.
Because I had lunch with Rich Me neither!
-What now?
-Another hard eight.
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Shut up!
It just got interesting!
What did you say?
You roll another hard eight, we get married tonight.
You serious?
Yes.
I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
So if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it.
What do you say?
That's a four.
-And where's the other one?
-Under the table.
Nobody move!
You look that way, I look this way.
Here it is, here it is.
That could be 4 or 5.
It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.
Oh, well, lost again.
That's it.
You and me.
Outside!
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Be cool.
Okay, your lurking days are over.
What?
Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.
You move on, I'll be one step ahead of you every single time.
And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day till Monday because that's when I go home.
When do you leave?
Also Monday.
What time?
Maybe we can share a cab.
Hit me.
Hit me.
We need more cards.
Yeah.
And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.
Hello, Vegas?
We would like more alcohol.
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.
Oh, I forgot to dial.
That must be our alcohol and beers.
It's Joey!
I love Joey!
Oh, I love Joey!
Joey lives with a duck.
Look, I need some help, okay?
Someone has to convince my hand twin to cooperate.
I'll do it.
Whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Thanks.
Hey, Rach?
How you doing?
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?
Don't let her drink anymore.
Here's that macadamia nut.
No, something else.
So, what do you wanna do now?
I wanna get out of the room.
I really miss downstairs.
Okay, you know what?
There is only one way I am leaving this hotel room.
Well, hello!
I'm Ross.
-Good luck to you.
-Sir, you've got a little something.
Hello.
I won!
I won!
I finally won!
I won!
That was my quarter!
Take a hike, toots.
Excuse me, sir.
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.
Is that true, miss?
Sells drugs to kids.
She sells drugs to kids.
It was my quarter.
Was it her quarter?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
-Okay, lady, you're out of here.
-No, you can't arrest me!
I won't go back to that hellhole!
I'm just taking you outside.
I need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.
Here's something blue and new.
You are so efficient.
I love you.
-Let's go.
-No, wait!
We need something old.
I have a condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work.
I don't think so.
Now something borrowed.
Here, just take this.
That's stealing.
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.
Okay.
One thing at a time.
-Are you gonna play?
-No, I don't really have any money.
Not yet, anyway.
Can't sit here if you don't play.
My name is Regina Falangie.
I'm a businesswoman in town on business.
Would you like to see my card?
What did I do with my Filofax?
I must've left it in Conference Room B. -Fourteen.
-Hit me.
Oh, my God.
May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands?
They're identical.
I've never seen that in the business world.
Stop it.
Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at this table?
Please stop it.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see identical hands showcased in some type of an entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it to you!
Didn't I just throw you out?
No, you threw out Phoebe.
I'm Regina Falangie.
Falangie.
Come on, lady.
Please take him too.
Me?
Oh, come on, man.
Come on, buddy.
Don't let him do this.
Come on!
I'm your hand twin!
Hello.
One marriage, please.
We want to get married.
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.
All right.
What are you doing?
The "Wedding March".
Does that freak you out?
No, it's the graduation song.
This is it.
We're gonna get married.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Wait.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
-Phoebe, could you get that, please?
-Why?
Just because you're too lazy to get up off your tushy?
No, it's just that all the people in the world I would want to talk to are right here.
Sucker.
Hello?
-Hey, Joey!
-Hey, Phoebe.
I need a favor.
I forgot the PlN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?
Sure.
Where is it?
I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
So you're 5-6-3-9?
That's it!
Thanks.
-Wanna talk to Chandler?
-Let me talk to him.
He didn't believe in my movie which is a big mistake, because it is real.
Real.
Tribbiani, get back to work.
Break time's over.
-Who was that?
-My stunt double.
Yeah.
He's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
I've tried to apologize.
If I can't do it on the phone, I'll go and do it in person.
I heard that.
Can you put him on?
Don't come out here.
I support you 100% and I wanna prove that to you in person.
I got that.
I forgive you.
Don't come out here.
You haven't taken my calls for a week.
I'm totally over it.
Friends forever.
Don't come out here.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
-What was that?
-Entertainment Tonight.
Good talking to you and don't come out here.
The One in Vegas Monica?
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?
That's okay.
What the hell took you so long?
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.
-Which Richard?
-The Richard.
Richard Simmons?
Oh, my God!
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?
It was really nice.
We talked and I had lunch with him.
That's weird.
I dreamed you had lunch with Richard.
-Really?
-Again, Richard Simmons.
Go on.
The strange part was he was really nice and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything.
So why can't we tell Chandler?
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary.
I don't wanna spoil it.
I can't believe you guys have lasted a whole year!
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
On a totally different bet.
-It's almost our anniversary!
-I know.
One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
I got you a gift.
-It's not till tomorrow.
-I know, but you have to open it today.
Okay!
There you go!
It's two tickets to Vegas!
Yeah!
For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start our celebration on the plane.
We can call it our "Plane-aversary".
Do we have to?
This is great, but Joey didn't want any of us there.
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.
Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
"Anna-vada-versary"!
I think we should see other people.
We can go, right?
Great idea.
I'm gonna go too!
Phoebe, it's kind of our anniversary.
You won't ditch me like you did with London.
Ditch you?
You were pregnant Great story.
I'm going.
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
Including me!
Do you wanna go?
I can take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit.
I waited a year for this.
Art lover.
What'd you say?
I said, art lover.
-Was that supposed to be an insult?
-I don't know, I'm very tired.
-Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
-Sounds great.
I'll call the airlines.
That'll be nice to have the apartment to myself.
To walk around naked.
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So far, it's pretty much the same, Phoebe.
What about after I give you these candies?
I guess it's a little better now.
Las Vegas, 1.
London, 0.
I'll be back.
Happy Plane-aversary.
I love you.
-Can I give you your present now?
-Okay!
Oh, don't tell me I did this.
I love "l forgot the present" fake-out!
How about "I did forget the present, forgive me" not fake-out?
You can give it to me when we get back.
This is the worst thing that could happen.
You decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What "Richard thing"?
Oh, no.
What "Richard thing"?
Simmons.
Go with Simmons.
I ran into Richard yesterday.
He asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
I didn't tell you because you'd get mad and I didn't wanna spoil our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really?
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite".
No big deal.
Great.
Okay, London, 1.
This is gonna be a real horserace.
Oh, look what happened.
Check me out.
I'm in my kitchen naked.
I'm picking up an orange.
I'm naked.
I'm lighting the candles.
Naked.
And carefully.
Oh, my God!
That's Rachel, naked!
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.
Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
She knows I'm home.
She knows I can see her.
What kind of game is she playing?
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
You're being silly.
Or am I?
Love to love you baby Love to love you baby Love to love you baby Darn it!
May I come in?
Yeah, if you want to.
Do you want me to?
Yeah, sure?
So do l. Okay, Rach, before anything happens I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
This is just about tonight.
I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us".
I just want this to be about what it is.
And what is that, Ross?
The physical act of love.
What, are you crazy?
So you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
Oh, God.
You saw me?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
You actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
Oh, wow.
I'm sorry.
But, Ross, you kicked off your shoes.
-Can we just forget this ever happened?
-Of course.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
-Thank you.
-Yes.
-I guess I'm gonna go pack.
-Okay.
Wait, one more thing.
Do we still need to settle the question of "us"?
Hey, you guys, wait!
You guys.
This place is much better than London.
A lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me this.
Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner.
You don't eat animals.
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
I can totally settle down here.
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey!
Look!
Look!
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Love your condoms, my man.
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.
Hold on a second.
Can we cut?
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.
Who are you talking to?
The director.
Her.
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.
Why?
What happened?
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.
I'm working here till it starts up, if it ever does.
-I'm so sorry.
-Such a drag.
Sorry I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry.
Apparently there's a new policy of not sharing.
-I knew you weren't okay with that.
-So you're a gladiator!
What's going on?
-Monica had lunch with Richard.
-Dawson?
But that would've been so cool!
Her boyfriend Richard.
It meant nothing.
After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky men and don't tell me!
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I should've told you.
Thanks.
-There we go.
-Now I love Vegas.
I promise you next time I absolutely will tell you.
-"Next time"?
-So close.
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.
That's funny, I think I just did.
If you act like this, I won't be around you.
-Fine.
-Happy anniversary!
Guys, please!
Come on, come on.
This is obviously a misunderstanding.
No, it is not.
Don't look at me.
I just work here.
Okay, Ross?
I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.
Now, I'm just letting you know this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep, that's hilarious.
I'm sorry.
I'm done.
I'm done.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really.
You've seen me naked hundreds of times.
But it was a first for the rest of my building.
That's true.
But I just don't embarrass that easily.
What?
You totally get embarrassed.
No, I don't.
Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
-ls that so?
-Yeah.
Hey, lady!
I don't care how much you want it, okay?
I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
-Really?
-Yeah, sure, sure.
They would scrub the floors.
They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
Sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.
So they would stick it right I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.
He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
Can you believe that?
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
Build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
Wait!
Why don't I just do what that guy did?
I'll take this $100, turn it into $5000 and I'll turn that into enough to get my movie going!
Good luck.
I don't need luck.
I've thought this through.
I see.
Thanks.
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.
You had a minor setback in your relationship.
Big deal.
It's only Chandler.
I am so sorry.
This is crazy.
Such a stupid argument.
I don't wanna see Richard.
So go fix it.
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.
Tell him sorry and you love him.
You're right, Phoebe.
-Thank you.
-Sure.
Yeah!
Las Vegas!
Number one!
Anybody lose this?
Coming out.
Place your bet.
Dice her out.
Yellow 11.
Pay the front line!
So I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?
What are you?
I am sorry, sir.
I think he just really likes you.
You know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
-Can I help you?
-Yes.
Do you have any extra pants?
My friend seems to have had a little accident.
-Can I change $100?
-Changing $100.
-Good luck, sir.
-Thanks.
That's right.
-Thirteen.
-Hit me!
Oh, man!
Wait!
You are not gonna believe this!
I have found my identical hand twin.
What?
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
What does it sound like?
It's a guy with my identical hands.
It was incredible.
The dealer's hands were exactly like mine.
It was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
You sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
-How?
-I don't have it all worked out yet.
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!
Again, I must go back to how?
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!
How much would you pay to see this hand twice?
I can't really put a price on that.
Are you un-supporting me again?
I support you 100%.
I just didn't get it right away.
Now I'm caught up.
Identical hand twins.
It's a million-dollar idea!
Right?
I know.
Okay.
All right.
What's that for?
Well, I gotta document this before that dealer gets off his break.
I found my identical hand twin!
Oh, you're so lucky!
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?
But she just came up here.
That was Joey.
I wonder where she is?
It's so weird.
She's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that?
You know what she said after her lunch with Richard?
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.
-Really?
-Yes.
She feels terrible.
She really wants to make up.
You've gotta find her.
Good.
I should really start wearing hats.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
-Did you enjoy your flight?
-I did.
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.
-I hope you had a nice flight.
-Oh, it was the best.
I think the check-in is that way.
Kids love me.
Hi, you guys are here!
What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?
Let me guess.
Pancho Villa.
And you're Bob Saget.
Pancho Villa?
What are you talking about, Phoebe?
I don't Oh, my God!
You drew on me?
Hey, you wet my pants!
What kind of party was this?
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.
It's the third time she's won on a machine I was playing.
I bet she's one of those people.
Mole people?
What?
No, a lurker.
What's that?
When you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out a lurker waits for you to give up and then Kills you?
They swoop in and steal your jackpot.
-How do you know about this?
-My nana used to do it.
That's how she paid for my dance Karate lessons.
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.
-lt won't come off.
-What?
It won't come off.
Oh, my God.
Rach, are you sure?
I took it off and then I drew it back on.
Rach, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sure we can get it off, okay?
-Just give me your pen.
-Why?
What are you gonna do?
Well, I believe I'm going to stab you repeatedly.
Not here.
There are cameras everywhere.
You made it!
Who's your friend?
He's hot.
Thanks, man.
Listen, I talked to Chandler.
And I'm sorry about the movie.
Don't be sorry.
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.
Your what?
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.
-Were you looking for this person?
-Not even.
This thing is a gold mine.
What?
That won't make you any money.
Well, fine.
None of you will live with me in my hand-shaped mansion.
Except you.
You can live in the thumb.
All right, baby, come on!
I am on fire!
See you later.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
Going home.
Why?
Wait.
Sorry, I was just playing for one second.
If you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't.
He means nothing to me.
Oh, come on.
I was there.
I know he's the love of your life.
Not anymore.
Really?
Really.
All right?
Let's forget about going home and celebrate our anniversary.
Okay, this is empty.
I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
Tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this?
I don't know about the hands, but he went to the restroom.
How you doing?
-Very busy.
-Right.
Okay.
Yes, hello.
I have a question.
I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No, she didn't think so.
I know.
It's like Anyway.
Makeup didn't cover it, we've tried everything and nothing's worked.
What do we do?
Thank you.
Yeah, it's not coming off.
What?
What else did he say?
He said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look.
Let's just go downstairs we'll have some fun and you will forget all about it.
There's no way I am leaving looking like this!
Come on, Rach.
It's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!
Just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you can't have fun.
Besides, no one will even look at you.
This is Vegas.
Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.
There are tons of freaks here.
No other.
No.
Come on.
No one will notice.
I swear.
There was some staring and pointing.
I need a drink.
They really overcharge you for that stuff.
But who cares, because it's all on me.
That is one big drink.
Macadamia nut?
Wow!
That's some pricey nut.
Really like those macadamia nuts?
Nope.
Get out of here, you lurker!
Go on, get!
You made up.
I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
She couldn't live without the "Chand love".
Get a room.
-We have one.
-Use it.
Bye, Chandler.
Bye, Mon.
Phoebe, Phoebe.
Please pick up a house phone.
You have a call from Chandler and Mon.
Hello, Chandler and Mon.
Hello?
You dirty lurker!
I'm sorry, you are the same old lady, right?
Yeah.
Dirty lurker!
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.
Excuse me?
It's me.
Joey.
Do I know you?
Joey?
Yeah, the hand guy.
So, what are we gonna do about this hand twin thing?
Nothing.
Look, you and I have been given a gift.
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling.
Or magic.
And you know NASA's gonna want to talk to us.
I have to get back to work.
We can have our own show.
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!
And I wrote a song for us.
This hand is your hand This hand is my hand Oh, wait, that's your hand No, wait, it's my hand -That's okay.
-But you haven't even heard the chorus!
Oh, my God.
I look like my great-aunt Muriel.
All right, you know what?
We don't have to go downstairs.
We can bring Vegas up to us.
All right, come on.
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.
-Thirteen.
-Hit me.
Twenty-three.
Which is what we play to at this casino!
You win 10 dollars!
-I bet 20.
-Right.
A new pair of shoes for the Chan-Chan man!
I've never seen a roll like this!
That's right, baby!
What do I want now?
Eight?
-Six.
-Pick a number!
That is your only job.
-Eight.
-Thank you.
If you get this, we buy everybody a steak dinner.
Eight it is.
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?
-No.
-Okay, good.
-What do I want now?
-Try a hard eight.
-What?
-Two fours.
Eight!
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.
You get this and we get the biggest suite in the place.
We get the biggest suite in the place.
The biggest suite in the place!
Come on!
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.
Because I had lunch with Rich Me neither!
-What now?
-Another hard eight.
Hard eight?
Let's call it easy eight!
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Shut up!
It just got interesting!
What did you say?
You roll another hard eight, we get married tonight.
You serious?
Yes.
I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
So if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it.
What do you say?
That's a four.
-And where's the other one?
-Under the table.
Nobody move!
You look that way, I look this way.
Here it is, here it is.
That could be 4 or 5.
It's your call.
It's a four.
I think so too.
Oh, well, lost again.
That's it.
You and me.
Outside!
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Be cool.
Okay, your lurking days are over.
What?
Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.
You move on, I'll be one step ahead of you every single time.
And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day till Monday because that's when I go home.
When do you leave?
Also Monday.
What time?
Maybe we can share a cab.
Hit me.
Hit me.
We need more cards.
Yeah.
And we also need more drinks.
Hold on a second.
Hello, Vegas?
We would like more alcohol.
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.
Oh, I forgot to dial.
That must be our alcohol and beers.
It's Joey!
I love Joey!
Oh, I love Joey!
Joey lives with a duck.
Look, I need some help, okay?
Someone has to convince my hand twin to cooperate.
I'll do it.
Whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Thanks.
Hey, Rach?
How you doing?
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?
Don't let her drink anymore.
Here's that macadamia nut.
No, something else.
So, what do you wanna do now?
I wanna get out of the room.
I really miss downstairs.
Okay, you know what?
There is only one way I am leaving this hotel room.
Well, hello!
I'm Ross.
-Good luck to you.
-Sir, you've got a little something.
Hello.
I won!
I won!
I finally won!
I won!
That was my quarter!
Take a hike, toots.
Excuse me, sir.
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.
Is that true, miss?
Sells drugs to kids.
She sells drugs to kids.
It was my quarter.
Was it her quarter?
How about we talk about this over dinner?
-Okay, lady, you're out of here.
-No, you can't arrest me!
I won't go back to that hellhole!
I'm just taking you outside.
I need something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.
Here's something blue and new.
You are so efficient.
I love you.
-Let's go.
-No, wait!
We need something old.
I have a condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work.
I don't think so.
Now something borrowed.
Here, just take this.
That's stealing.
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.
Okay.
One thing at a time.
-Are you gonna play?
-No, I don't really have any money.
Not yet, anyway.
Can't sit here if you don't play.
My name is Regina Falangie.
I'm a businesswoman in town on business.
Would you like to see my card?
What did I do with my Filofax?
I must've left it in Conference Room B. -Fourteen.
-Hit me.
Oh, my God.
May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands?
They're identical.
I've never seen that in the business world.
Stop it.
Miss Falangie, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at this table?
Please stop it.
Wouldn't you pay good money to see identical hands showcased in some type of an entertainment venue?
If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it to you!
Didn't I just throw you out?
No, you threw out Phoebe.
I'm Regina Falangie.
Falangie.
Come on, lady.
Please take him too.
Me?
Oh, come on, man.
Come on, buddy.
Don't let him do this.
Come on!
I'm your hand twin!
Hello.
One marriage, please.
We want to get married.
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.
All right.
What are you doing?
The "Wedding March".
Does that freak you out?
No, it's the graduation song.
This is it.
We're gonna get married.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!
Wait.
Okay.
